OPINION OF THE COURT BY GINOZA, J.

 
Defendant-Appellee John P. Dunbar, Jr. (Dunbar) was
 
charged in this case with Failure to Provide Specimen For
 
Forensic Identification, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes
 (HRS) § 844D-31(a) (2014) and § 844D-111(a) (2014).

1 HRS § 844D-31(a) provides: 
§844D-31 Offenders subject to collection. (a) Any
person, except for any juvenile, who is convicted of, or
pleads guilty or no contest to, any felony offense, even if
the plea is deferred, or is found not guilty by reason of
insanity of any felony offense, shall provide buccal swab
samples and print impressions of each hand, and, if required
by the collecting agency's rules or internal regulations,
blood specimens, required for law enforcement identification
analysis.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Appellant State of Hawai 'i (State) asserts that Dunbar, having 
been convicted of a felony offense in 2005, and after having
 
received written notice in 2014 from the collecting agency of his
 
2
obligation to provide a buccal swab sample,  failed in 2014 to
provide a buccal swab for the collection of his deoxyribonucleic
 acid (DNA), as required under HRS Chapter 844D.
3
 
The Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (circuit
4
court) dismissed the charge against Dunbar in this case by way
of its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Granting
 Defendant's Motion to Dismiss (Order Granting Motion to Dismiss),
 filed on February 3, 2015. The circuit court ruled that Dunbar
 had "successfully completed probation and once [Dunbar's]
 probationary period terminated, [Dunbar] was no longer subject to
 collection [of his DNA] under HRS Section 844D-35." The circuit
 court further ruled that, given the provisions within HRS Chapter
 
 
1(...continued)
At the time of the alleged offense in this case, HRS § 844D-111

provided:
 
§844D-111 Refusal or failure to provide specimen for
forensic identification. (a) A person commits the offense
of refusal or failure to provide specimen for forensic
identification if the person is required by this chapter to
provide any blood specimens, buccal swab samples, or print
impressions and intentionally or knowingly refuses or fails
to provide any of the required blood specimens, buccal swab
samples, or print impressions after the person has received
written notice from the department, the department of public
safety, any law enforcement personnel, or officer of the
court that the person is required to provide each and every
one of the blood specimens, buccal swab samples, and print
impressions required by this chapter.
(b) Any person who negligently or recklessly fails to
comply with this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
2 HRS § 844D-1 (2014) defines "buccal swab" as "a swab used to collect
buccal cells from the mouth cavity by wiping the interior surface of the
cheek."
3
 The Amended Complaint alleges that Dunbar failed to provide a blood
sample, buccal swab sample and/or hand print impressions. However, an
affidavit attached to the initial Complaint only indicates that Dunbar was
requested to provide a DNA buccal swab sample. Further, the State's briefs to
this court only address Dunbar's obligation to provide a buccal swab sample.

844D that describe categories of persons from whom DNA samples
 
could be collected, the Legislature intended to limit collection
 to the categories of persons described.
 
On appeal, the State challenges the circuit court's
 
dismissal of the charge and its ruling that the State could no
 longer obtain Dunbar's buccal swab sample in 2014, after he had
 been discharged from probation for his felony conviction. HRS
 Chapter 844D became effective on July 1, 2005, and the parties do
 not dispute that relevant provisions within Chapter 844D Part III
 are retroactive. Thus, Dunbar does not contest that he was
 subject to collection of his DNA samples while he was on
 probation for his 2005 felony conviction, even though his
 conviction was entered on June 29, 2005, prior to the effective
 date of HRS Chapter 844D. However, the parties dispute whether
 the State could still collect Dunbar's DNA buccal swab samples in
 2014, after he had been discharged from probation for his 2005
 felony offense.
 
Under the circumstances of this case and the relevant
 
provisions in HRS Chapter 844D Part III, we hold that Dunbar was
 no longer required to provide a buccal swab sample after he had
 been discharged from probation for his felony offense.
5 We
 
therefore affirm the circuit court's dismissal of the charge
 against Dunbar in this case based on the reasons set forth below.
I. Background
 
On June 29, 2005, in a previous case before the circuit
 
court, State v. Dunbar, Criminal No. 04-1-0450(1), a Judgment was
 entered convicting Dunbar of Attempted Escape in the Second
 Degree, in violation of HRS § 710-1021 (2014), a class C felony.
6
 
Dunbar was sentenced to probation for a term of five (5) years. 
5 Our holding is limited to the circumstances of this case. We make no
 
comment on the possibility that under HRS Chapter 844D Part III, Dunbar could
become subject to collection of buccal swab samples, hand print impressions
and/or blood specimens in future circumstances based on his 2005 felony
offense.

A few days later, on July 1, 2005, HRS Chapter 844D
 
became effective. Within HRS Chapter 844D Part III ("Offenders
 
Subject to Collection of Specimens or Samples, or Print
 
7
 HRS § 844D-31(a) provides that:
 Impressions"),
Any person, except for any juvenile, who is convicted of, or
pleads guilty or no contest to, any felony offense, even if
the plea is deferred, or is found not guilty by reason of
insanity of any felony offense, shall provide buccal swab
samples and print impressions of each hand, and, if required
by the collecting agency's rules or internal regulations,
blood specimens, required for law enforcement identification
analysis.
 
(Emphasis added.) Further, HRS § 844D-41 (2014) provides for the
 
retroactive application of specified provisions within Part III
 and identifies the provisions under which collection shall occur,
 stating in relevant part:
 
Sections 844D-31, 844D-33, and 844D-34 to 844D-37 shall have
retroactive application. Collection shall occur pursuant to
sections 844D-34 to 844D-38 regardless of when the crime
charged or committed became a qualifying offense pursuant to
this chapter, and regardless of when the person was
convicted of the qualifying offense described in section
844D-31(a) . . . .
 
(Emphasis added.) In turn, HRS § 844D-35 (2014) addresses the
 
collection of, inter alia, buccal swab samples where "[t]he
 person is on probation or parole[.]" As discussed infra, the
 interpretation of HRS § 844D-35 is at the core of this case.
 
On March 18, 2008, approximately two years and nine
 
months after Dunbar's felony judgment of conviction was entered
 on June 29, 2005, in Criminal No. 04-1-0450(1), the circuit court
 in that case granted Dunbar's motion for early termination of
 probation. It is undisputed that Dunbar was then formally
 discharged from his probationary sentence by way of an order
 entered on April 11, 2008. 
In February of 2014, almost six years after Dunbar had
 
been discharged from probation in Criminal No. 04-1-0450(1), the
 State, through the Department of the Attorney General, initiated
 contact with Dunbar to obtain his buccal swab sample. Due to
 
7 HRS Chapter 844D Part III consists of §§ 844D-31 through 844D-41.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Dunbar's failure to provide the requested sample, the State filed
 
its initial Complaint in this case on August 22, 2014, in the
 District Court of the Second Circuit. Dunbar requested a jury
 trial and thus the State filed a Complaint in circuit court on
 September 26, 2014. The State filed an Amended Complaint on
 November 12, 2014, to make a technical amendment. The Amended
 Complaint asserts, in relevant part, that "on or about the period
 of February 15, 2014, through and including March 21, 2014,"
 Dunbar "having been convicted of any felony offense"
 intentionally or knowingly failed to provide, inter alia, buccal
 swab samples "after receiving written notice by the collecting
 agency[.]" 
On November 17, 2014, Dunbar filed a Motion to Dismiss
 
claiming the State had not requested his DNA sample while he was
 on probation and that he was no longer required to provide a DNA
 sample because he had completed his probation. On February 3,
 2015, the circuit court filed the Order Granting Motion to
 Dismiss. 
On February 4, 2015, the State timely filed its Notice
 
of Appeal.
 
II. Standards of Review
 
Our review in this case is de novo, based on
 
interpreting provisions in HRS Chapter 844D Part III.
 
The interpretation of a statute is a question of law that we
review de novo. Similarly, a trial court's conclusions of
law are reviewable de novo under the right/wrong standard.
Under the de novo standard, this court must examine the
facts and answer the pertinent question of law without being
required to give any weight or deference to the trial
court's answer to the question. 
 
State v. Kelekolio, 94 Hawai 'i 354, 356, 14 P.3d 364, 366 (App. 
2000) (citations omitted).
III. Discussion
 
The State contends that the circuit court erred when it
 
entered Conclusions of Law (COLs) 9, 10, 11, 13, and 14, upon
 
which it based its ruling that Dunbar was not required to provide
 a buccal swab sample under the circumstances of this case.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
The circuit court's COLs 9-14 state:
 
9. Pursuant to HRS Sections 844D-35 and 844D-41,
Defendant was no longer subject to collection under HRS
Section 844D-35.
 
10. Defendant successfully completed probation and
once Defendant’s probationary period terminated, Defendant
was no longer subject to collection under HRS Section
844D-35.
 
11. The creation and description of the various
categories of persons from whom DNA samples [sic] in HRSSections 844D-34 to 844D-37 suggests the Hawai' i State 
Legislature intended to limit collection to the categoriesof persons described. If such limits were not intended,there would have been no reason for the Hawai' i State 
Legislature to have created and described the variouscategories. 
12. As evidenced in drafts of the bill that was to 
become HRS Chapter 844D, the Hawai' i State Legislature
contemplated a category of collection from persons such asthe Defendant, i.e., convicted felons who were no longerincarcerated, and who were no longer on probation, parole orother release.
8 
13. Omission of such a category from the enacted HRS
Chapter 844D suggests that the Hawai' i State Legislature did
not intend to collect DNA samples from convicted felons whowere no longer incarcerated, and who were no longer onprobation, parole or other release. 
14. Therefore, since Defendant was no longer on
probation, not incarcerated, not on parole, not on other
release, not a parole violator, and had not been returned to
custody, the law does not provide for the collection of
Defendant’s DNA sample.
 
The precise issue before this court is whether Dunbar,
 
who had been subject to collection of his DNA sample as a felony
 
offender under the retroactive provisions in HRS Chapter 844D
 Part III, was still required to provide a DNA sample when the
 State did not seek to obtain a sample until after his probation
 for the felony offense had been discharged by the court.
9 In
 
resolving this issue, we must interpret and apply provisions
 within HRS Chapter 844D Part III.
 
First, the fundamental starting point for statutory

particularly in COL 13, address issues other than the one in this case, we do

interpretation is the language of the statute itself.
Second, where the statutory language is plain and
unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain
and obvious meaning. Third, implicit in the task of
statutory construction is our foremost obligation to
ascertain and give effect to the intention of the
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the
language contained in the statute itself. Fourth, when there
is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or indistinctiveness or
uncertainty of an expression used in a statute, an ambiguity
exists. And fifth, in construing an ambiguous statute, the
meaning of the ambiguous words may be sought by examining
the context, with which the 
 ambiguous words, phrases, and
sentences may be compared, in order to ascertain their true
meaning. Moreover, the courts may resort to extrinsic aids
in determining the legislative intent. One avenue is the use
of legislative history as an interpretive tool.
 
Kelekolio,  94 Hawai 'i at 356-57, 14 P.3d at 366-67 (citation 
omitted, block format altered). Furthermore,
 
It is fundamental in statutory construction that each part
or section of a statute should be construed in connection
 with every other part or section so as to produce a
harmonious whole. In re Castro, 44 Haw. 455, 458, 355 P.2d
46, 48 (1960). Statutes should be interpreted according to
the intent and meaning, and not always according to the
letter, and every part thereof must be viewed in connection
with the whole so as to make all parts harmonize, if
practicable, and give a sensible and intelligent effect to
each. Id.
 
State v. Davis, 63 Haw. 191, 196, 624 P.2d 376, 380 (1981).
 
A. HRS § 844D-41 (Retroactive Application)
 
The State's first contention is that under HRS § 844D­
41, it is plain, clear and unambiguous that DNA collection
 
requirements apply retroactively.10 The circuit court's
 
conclusions do not contradict this point. Indeed, Dunbar does
 
10 HRS § 844D-41 provides in full:
 
[§844D-41] Retroactive application.  Sections 844D-31,
844D-33, and 844D-34 to 844D-37 shall have retroactive
application. Collection shall occur pursuant to sections
844D-34 to 844D-38 regardless of when the crime charged or
committed became a qualifying offense pursuant to this
chapter, and regardless of when the person was convicted of
the qualifying offense described in section 844D-31(a) or a
similar crime under the laws of the United States or any
other state, or pursuant to the United States Code of
Military Justice, for commission of a qualifying offense
described in section 844D-31(a) or a similar crime under the
laws of the United States or any other state.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
not contest that, as expressly stated in HRS § 844D-41, relevant
 
provisions in Part III have retroactive application. Thus, even
 though he was convicted of a felony offense prior to the
 effective date of HRS Chapter 844D, Dunbar has no quarrel with
 the State that, while he was on probation for his felony offense,
 he was subject to collection of his DNA via a buccal swab sample. 
The State's argument based on HRS § 844D-41 does not address the
 key issue in dispute, which is whether the State could collect
 the buccal swab sample even after Dunbar had been discharged from
 probation for the 2005 felony.
B. HRS Chapter 844D Part III does not provide for the
collection of Dunbar's DNA after his release from probation
1. Relevant Statutory Provisions
 
As noted by the circuit court during the hearing on
 
Dunbar's motion to dismiss, some provisions in Chapter 844D Part
 III address who is "subject to" collection of their buccal swab
 samples, hand print impressions, and possibly blood specimens. 
See HRS §§ 844D-31 and 844D-32 (2014). Other provisions,
 however, address the collection process and requirements related
 to specified categories of individuals. See HRS §§ 844D-34
 
through 844D-37 (2014).
 
As discussed above, there is no dispute that because of
 
his 2005 felony offense, Dunbar was generally "subject to"
 collection under HRS § 844D-31(a). HRS § 844D-31 provides in
 full:
 
§844D-31 Offenders subject to collection. (a) Any
person, except for any juvenile, who is convicted of, or
pleads guilty or no contest to, any felony offense, even if
the plea is deferred, or is found not guilty by reason of
insanity of any felony offense, shall provide buccal swab
samples and print impressions of each hand, and, if required
by the collecting agency's rules or internal regulations,
blood specimens, required for law enforcement identification
analysis.
(b) Testing pursuant to this section shall begin
immediately for all persons who have been convicted of
murder in any degree or any felony offense defined in
chapter 846E and all persons convicted of any felony offense
who are confined in a correctional facility or other
detention facility, including private correctional
facilities, but shall not begin for other persons until
thirty days after statewide publication of notice by the
 
8
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
attorney general pursuant to section 1-28.5.
(c) The attorney general's notice, pursuant to
subsection (b), may be provided in stages, beginning with
notice of the beginning of testing of all persons not
already mandated to be tested by subsection (b) who have
been convicted of a class A felony, then notice of the
beginning of testing of all persons not already mandated to
be tested by subsection (b) who have been convicted of a
class B felony, and finally notice of the beginning of
testing of all persons not already mandated to be tested by
subsection (b) who have been convicted of a class C felony.
(d) Nothing in this section shall be construed as
prohibiting collection and analysis of specimens, samples,
or print impressions as a condition of a plea for a
non-qualifying offense.
 
(Emphasis added.) A plain reading of HRS § 844D-31(a) requires
 
that any person, except for a juvenile, who is convicted of any
 felony or who is found not guilty by reason of insanity of any
 felony must provide, inter alia, buccal swab samples. Both
 parties agree that Dunbar falls within this section of Chapter
 844D because he was convicted in June 2005 of a class C felony
 and HRS § 844D-41 provides for the retroactive application of HRS
 § 844D-31.
 
In turn, certain sections in Chapter 844D Part III,
 
11
including HRS §§ 844D-34 to 844D-37,  address more specifically
the process for collection of, inter alia, buccal swabs from
 specified categories of convicted felons. Indeed, in addressing
 the retroactive provisions, HRS § 844D-41 provides that
 "[c]ollection shall occur pursuant to sections 844D-34 to 844D-38
 regardless of when the crime charged or committed became a
 qualifying offense pursuant to this chapter, and regardless of
 when the person was convicted of the qualifying offense described
 in section 844D-31(a)[.]" (Emphasis added.)
12
 
11 These sections are entitled: HRS § 844D-34 "Collection from persons
confined or in custody after conviction or adjudication"; HRS § 844D-35
"Collection from persons on probation, parole, or other release"; HRS § 844D­36 "Collection from parole violators and others returned to custody"; HRS
§ 844D-37 "Collection from persons accepted into Hawaii from other
jurisdictions."
12 Other provisions within Chapter 844D Part III also provide for
testing, collection and/or analysis in other specified circumstances. See HRS
 
§§ 844D-31(b), 844D-33, 844D-39, 844D-40. Moreover, HRS § 844D-38 addresses
replacement of specimens, samples, or print impressions that are not usable.
 
9
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Both parties recognize that HRS § 844D-35 is the
 
relevant collection provision related to Dunbar's circumstances. 
HRS § 844D-35 provides:
 
[§844D-35] Collection from persons on probation,
parole, or  other release . (a) A person, except for any
juvenile, shall provide buccal swab samples and print
impressions and, if required pursuant to this chapter,
blood specimens if:
(1) 
The person is on probation or parole for any
felony offense, whether or not that crime or
offense is one set forth in section 844D-31(a);
(2) The person has a record of any past or present
conviction of a qualifying offense described in
section 844D-31 or has a record of any past or
present conviction or adjudication in any other
court, including any state, federal, or military
court, of any offense that, if committed or
attempted in this State, would have been
punishable as an offense described in section
844D-31; and
 
(3) The person's blood specimens or buccal swab
samples, and print impressions authorized by this
chapter are not in the possession of the
department or have not been recorded as part of
the state DNA database and data bank 
identification program.
(b) The person shall have any required specimens,
samples, or print impressions collected within twenty
working days of being notified by the court, or a law
enforcement agency or other entity authorized by the
department. The specimens, samples, or print impressions
shall be collected in accordance with section 844D-21 at a
 correctional facility or a state, county, private, or other
facility designated for this collection.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
Considering first and foremost the actual language that
 
was adopted, as we must, HRS § 844D-35 appears to provide that
 
any person, except for a juvenile, must provide, inter alia,
 buccal swab samples if (1) the person 
is on probation or parole
 
for any felony offense; and (2) the person has a record of any
 past or present conviction of a qualifying offense under HRS 
§ 844D-31 (or a conviction or adjudication of any offense in
 another court that would qualify under HRS § 844D-31 if committed
 or attempted in Hawai
'i); and (3) the person's, inter alia, 
buccal swab samples are not in the possession of the police
 department or have not been recorded in the State DNA database
 and data bank. Further, under section (b), the subject
 individual is required to provide their, inter alia, samples
 
10

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
"within twenty working days of being notified by the court, or a
 
law enforcement agency or other entity authorized by the
 [Honolulu Police Department]." Under this reading of HRS § 844D­35, the statute would not apply to Dunbar in 2014, when he was
 notified to provide a buccal swab sample, because although he had
 a past conviction of a qualifying offense under HRS § 844D-31 and
 his, inter alia, buccal swab samples were apparently not in the
 possession of the police department or in the State database, he
 was no longer on probation or parole by the time the State sought
 his samples.
 
The State argues that, because legislative history
 
indicates that the Legislature intended DNA samples to be
 collected from all convicted felons, we must construe HRS § 844D­35 in such a way that Dunbar was required to provide his buccal
 swab sample even after he completed his probation. In a sense,
 the State suggests that the legislative history dictates an
 interpretation that appears at odds with the actual language
 adopted. In this regard, the State points to the phrase "other
 release" in the title of HRS § 844D-35, argues that we should
 apply the plain meaning of "release" under Black's Law
 
13
Dictionary  and thus that HRS § 844D-35 must apply to convicted
felons discharged from their sentences. 
Notably, however, there
 
is nothing in the text of HRS § 844D-35 that refers to "other
 release" or any type of discharge from a criminal sentence. The
 State further contends that the only logical way to interpret HRS
 § 844D-35 is by adding the word "or" between subsections (a)(1)
 and (a)(2) to avoid an absurd result, alleging that (a)(1) and
 (a)(2) are redundant and that it is the only way to possibly
 account for "other release" in the 
title.14 According to the
 
13 The State urges that under Black's Law Dictionary, the definition of
"release" includes "being freed from restraint or confinement" or "[a]
document giving formal discharge from custody[.]"
14 Although the State has consistently claimed the right to obtain
Dunbar's DNA sample in this case, the State's arguments on appeal are somewhat
different than what it argued to the circuit court.
 
11
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
State, if the word "or" is added between subsections (a)(1) and
 
(a)(2), "the effect [would be] that a person qualifies to submit
 DNA samples under HRS §§ 844D-35(a)(1) and (3) OR HRS §§ 844D­
35(a)(2) and (3)." As discussed below, we do not agree with the
 
State's assertions or its construction of the statute.
 
The State's contentions –- relying heavily on 
legislative history, pointing to the title of the statute, and arguing that the word "or" should be added to the text of the statute –- amount to assertions that HRS § 844D-35 is ambiguous. We agree that at least parts of HRS § 844D-35 appear to be ambiguous. As the State points out, subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) seem redundant because a person who "is on probation or parole for any felony offense" would appear to have "a record of any past or present conviction of a qualifying offense described in section 844D-31[.]" On its face, it does not appear that this ambiguity is particularly material to the issue presented in this appeal. However, given the State's arguments and the apparent ambiguity in HRS § 844D-35, we consider matters beyond the language of the statute to assist us in construing the statute and to confirm our interpretation of its language. See Tauese v. 
State Dep't of Labor & Indus. Relations, 113 Hawai
'i 1, 37, 147 
P.3d 785, 821 (2006)(regarding use of an ambiguous statute's title to aid in construing the statute); State v. Young, 107 Hawai
'i 36, 39, 109 P.3d 677, 680 (2005)("In construing an 
ambiguous statute, the meaning of the ambiguous words may be sought by examining the context, with which the ambiguous words, phrases, and sentences may be compared, in order to ascertain their true meaning[,]” and noting that courts may utilize "legislative history as an interpretive tool.")(citations, internal quotation marks and brackets omitted); State v. Entrekin, 98 Hawai
'i 221, 227, 47 P.3d 336, 342 (2002)(noting the 
use of legislative history to confirm the court's view in interpreting a statute). 
12
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
2. The Title of HRS § 844D-35
 
The full title for HRS § 844D-35 is "Collection from
 
persons on probation, parole, or other release." We do not view
 
the phrase "other release" in the title as creating an ambiguity
 in the statute. As expressed in Advertiser Publishing Co. v.
 Fase, 43 Haw. 154 (Haw. Terr. 1959),
 
the court may look to the title of a statute when construing
an ambiguous statute or construing an obscure passage or
expression therein. But the title of an act cannot limit
 
the plain meaning of its text, although it may be looked to
to aid in construction in cases of doubt.
 
Id. at 164 (emphasis added)(citation and internal quotation marks 
omitted). We thus consider the title of HRS § 844D-35 because the language in the text appears to be ambiguous. "Where a statute is ambiguous, its title may be referred to as an aid in construing the statute." Tauese, 113 Hawai
'i at 37, 147 P.3d at 
821 (quoting Honolulu Star Bulletin, Ltd. v. Burns, 50 Haw. 603, 606, 446 P.2d 171, 173 (1968)). 
Even considering the title of HRS § 844D-35, however,
 
it does not establish that Dunbar was required to provide his DNA
 sample under the circumstances of this case. Although the title
 references "other release," there is nothing in the text of the
 statute that is related to any release other than when "the
 person is on probation or parole for any felony offense." HRS 
§ 844D-35(a)(1) (emphasis added). All things considered, we view
 the language of the text, as well as the context of other
 provisions and the legislative history discussed infra, to be of
 greater significance than the title of HRS § 844D-35 in aiding us
 to construe the statute.
 
3. Context of HRS Chapter 844D Part III
 
The context of the other provisions adopted in Chapter
 
844D Part III provides strong support for our reading of HRS
 § 844D-35. As the circuit court emphasized, HRS § 844D-35 is one
 of several provisions that each address the collection process
 from individuals in varying circumstances. See HRS
 
§§ 844D-33 through 844D-40. This significantly cuts against the
 
13
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
State's contention that the Legislature intended to allow
 
collection of DNA samples from any felon at essentially any time.
 
15	 16 
Moreover, HRS § 844D-34  and § 844D-36  are of
 
15 HRS § 844D-34 provides:
 
[§844D-34] Collection from persons confined or in custody
after conviction or adjudication.  A person, except for any
juvenile, shall provide buccal swab samples and print impressions
and, if required by the collecting agency's rules or internal
regulations, blood specimens, immediately at intake, or during the
prison reception center process, or as soon as administratively
practicable at the appropriate custodial or receiving institution
or program if:
(1)	 The person is imprisoned or confined or placed
in a state correctional facility, a county
correctional facility, the department of public
safety, a residential treatment program, or any
state, county, private, or other facility after
a conviction of any felony offense;
 
(2)	 The person has a record of any past or present
conviction of a qualifying offense described in
section 844D-31 or has a record of any past or
present conviction or adjudication in any other
court, including any state, federal, or military
court, of any offense, that, if committed or
attempted in this State, would have been
punishable as an offense described in section
844D-31; and
(3)	 The person's blood specimens or buccal swab
samples, and print impressions authorized by
this chapter are not in the possession of the
department or have not been recorded as part of
the state DNA database and data bank
 identification program.
(Emphasis added.)
16 HRS § 844D-36 provides:
 
[§844D-36] Collection from parole violators and
others returned to custody.  A person, except for any
juvenile, shall provide buccal swab samples and print
impressions and, if required by the collecting agency's
rules or internal regulations, blood specimens or other
biological samples, at a state correctional or other
receiving institution, if:
(1)	 The person has been released on parole,
furlough, or other release for any offense or
crime, whether or not set forth in section
844D-31, and is returned to a state correctional
or other institution for a violation of a
 condition of the person's parole, furlough, or
other release, or for any other reason;
(2)	 The person has a record of any past or present
conviction of a qualifying offense described in
section 844D-31 or has a record of any past or
present conviction or adjudication in any other
court, including any state, federal, or military
(continued...)
 
14
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
particular note because these provisions are structured in a very
 
similar manner to HRS § 844D-35, they likewise delineate
 circumstances when an individual is under the supervision of the
 criminal justice system, and they establish when collection is
 authorized. All three statutory provisions start with a
 subparagraph that addresses different circumstances: a person is
 imprisoned, confined or placed in a facility after conviction of
 any felony offense; a person is on probation or parole for any
 felony offense; a person has been released for any offense or
 crime and has been returned to a correctional or other
 institution. See HRS § 844D-34(1); § 844D-35(a)(1); § 844D­
36(1). Each statute then contains almost identical subparagraphs
 that follow. See HRS § 844D-34(2) and (3); § 844D-35(a)(2) and
 
(a)(3); § 844D-36(2) and (3). Given the similar structure of
 these provisions, and making the assumption arguendo that we
 would even consider adding language to a statute, the State's
 contention that the word "or" must be added between subparagraph
 (a)(1) and (a)(2) in HRS § 844D-35 would need to make sense in
 the context of HRS § 844D-34 and § 844D-36 as well. It clearly
 does not make sense as to HRS § 844D-36, because a person
 released "for any offense or crime" would not necessarily have "a
 record of any past or present conviction of a qualifying offense
 described in section 844D-31[.]" See HRS § 844D-36(1) and (2)
 
(emphasis added). In short, although HRS §§ 844D-34 and 844D-35
 refer to "any felony offense" in the respective initial
 subparagraph, the initial subparagraph in § 844D-36 refers to
 
16(...continued) 
(3) court, of any offense that, if committed or
attempted in this State, would have beenpunishable as an offense described in section844D-31; and
The person's blood specimens or buccal swab samples,and print impressions authorized by this chapter arenot in the possession of the department's DNAlaboratory or have not been recorded as part of thestate DNA database and data bank identification program. 
(Emphasis added.) 
15
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"any offense or crime." Thus, in addition to being inconsistent
 
with a plain reading of HRS § 844D-35, the State's urging to add
 language to essentially restructure HRS § 844D-35 would be
 inconsistent in the context of other relevant provisions in HRS
 Chapter 844D Part III.
4. Legislative History
 
The legislative history further supports our reading of
 
HRS Chapter 844D Part III.
17 We agree with the State that the
 
legislative history for HRS Chapter 844D Part III indicates an
 intent to cover all felons, but the legislative history does not
 reveal an intent to allow unbridled collection of DNA samples at
 any time or under any circumstances. Rather, the legislative
 history indicates an intent to address not only the persons
 covered by the law, but to also address the collection process. 
Further, the legislative history shows that the Legislature
 considered two versions of a provision, denominated as section
 34, that would have generally allowed collection from all
 convicted felons after specified notice, but the provision was
 omitted from the final version of the bill.
 
Regarding the purpose for HRS Chapter 844D Part III,
 
the State points to committee reports stating that the purpose
 was to "[r]equire DNA testing of all felons," that it would
 "establish a statewide DNA database and databank identification
 program . . . that will include the DNA of all convicted
 felons[,]" and that "[t]he purpose of this bill is to enhance law
 
17 HRS Chapter 844D was adopted as Act 112 in 2005, which derives from
the passage of House Bill No. 1733. See 2005 Haw. Sess. Laws, Reg. Sess., Act
112, § 1 at 275-94; H.B. 1733, H.D.2, S.D.2, C.D.1, 23rd Leg., Reg. Sess.
(2005). House Bill No. 1733 went through several versions in both the House
and Senate before its eventual adoption, including at different times
incorporating a version of House Bill No. 590 and at other times incorporating
a version of Senate Bill No. 470, each of which dealt with the collection of
DNA samples from convicted felons. See H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 648, in 2005
House Journal, at 1294-95; H.B. No. 1733, H.D.1; S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No.
1273, in 2005 Senate Journal, at 1634-35; H.B. No. 1733, H.D.2, S.D.1.
Ultimately, after being considered in Conference Committee, House Bill No.
1733 was amended to revert back to the H.D.2 version of the bill, which had
incorporated a version of House Bill No. 590. See Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 184,
in 2005 House Journal, at 1827, 2005 Senate Journal, at 1089.
 
16
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
enforcement tools by establishing a statewide [DNA] database and
 
data bank identification program for all convicted felons." See
 
H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 648, in 2005 House Journal, at 1294; H.
 Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 956, in 2005 House Journal, at 1405; S.
 Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1273, in 2005 Senate Journal, at 1634; S.
 Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1534, in 2005 Senate Journal, at 1753;
 Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 184, in 2005 House Journal, at 1826-27, 2005
 Senate Journal, at 1088-89.
 
The committee reports do reflect the important purposes
 
of the bill, as noted by the State. However, these same reports
 also state that one of the purposes of the bill was to set out
 the procedures for collection of DNA samples. For example, House
 Standing Committee Report No. 648, House Standing Committee
 Report No. 956, and the final Conference Committee Report No. 184
 state that the bill would both "(1) [r]equire DNA testing of all
 felons" and "(2) [p]rovide procedures and duties for the
 collection and testing of DNA samples[.]" See H. Stand. Comm.
 
Rep. No. 648, in 2005 House Journal, at 1294; H. Stand. Comm.
 Rep. No. 956, in 2005 House Journal, at 1405; Conf. Comm. Rep.
 No. 184, in 2005 House Journal, at 1827, 2005 Senate Journal, at
 1089 (emphasis added). In the Senate, Standing Committee Report
 No. 1273 states one purpose of the bill was that it
 "[e]stablishes procedures and processes relating to the
 collection, analysis, and storage of blood specimens, buccal swab
 samples, and fingerprint impressions[.]" See S. Stand. Comm.
 
Rep. No. 1273, in 2005 Senate Journal, at 1635 (emphasis added);
 see also S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1534, in 2005 Senate Journal,
 at 1753.
 
Moreover, we agree that there were strong statements by
 
legislators in favor of expanding DNA sampling from all convicted
 felons (and not just from sex offenders or violent offenders as
 the law then provided). However, the statements cited by the
 State do not address the issue of how or when the DNA samples
 should be collected.
 
17
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
It is also significant that, as referenced by the
 
circuit court in COL 12, there were versions of House Bill No.
 
1733 -- the H.D.2 S.D.1 and H.D.2 S.D.2 versions -- that included
 a provision denominated as section 34, which would have allowed
 for collection of Dunbar's DNA sample in the circumstances of
 this case, but the provision was ultimately omitted from the
 final version of the bill. The omitted provision required that,
 after statewide publication of notice by the Attorney General,
 qualifying individuals were to provide their, inter alia, DNA
 samples within thirty days. This provision did not qualify
 collection based on whether the individuals were incarcerated, on
 probation, on parole, or under any other supervision by the
 State. In House Bill 1733 H.D.2 S.D.2, section 34 provided:
 
§ -34 Blood specimens, buccal swab samples and print
impressions required by this chapter for present and past
convictions for felony offenses.  (a) Blood specimens,
buccal swab samples, and print impressions shall be
collected 
from every person convicted of a felony offense
specified in section -31. Each person convicted of a
felony offense shall provide the blood specimen, buccal swab
sample, and print impressions within thirty days after the
statewide publication of notice by the attorney general as
provided in section  -31.
 
(b)
 If, subsequent to the effective date of this chapter, a
person becomes subject to the requirements of this chapter
and did not have blood specimens, buccal swab samples, and
print impressions taken immediately following the previous
felony conviction and the person is not confined or
incarcerated, the court shall order the person to report
within five calendar days to a correctional facility or a
state, county, private, or other designated facility to
provide the required blood specimens, buccal swab samples,
and print impressions in accordance with this chapter.
 
(Emphasis added.) The omission of this provision (and its
 
earlier counterpart in the H.D.2 S.D.1 version), shows that the
 Legislature considered, but ultimately decided to omit, a
 provision that would have allowed for the collection of, inter
 alia, a buccal swab sample from every person convicted of a
 felony offense, regardless of whether the individual was under
 any supervision of the State at the time. The omission of the
 above provision, especially in conjunction with the language
 actually adopted in HRS § 844D-35(a), supports Dunbar's arguments
 in this case.
 
18
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
18 Senate Bill No. 211 also proposed amendments to HRS § 844D-111
clarifying the offenses for the refusal to provide required specimens for
forensic identification.  No amendments were adopted for HRS § 844D-35, but
amendments were adopted for HRS § 844D-111.  See  2015 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 193,
§ 1 at 586-87.  The 2015 amendments to HRS § 844D-111, effective as of July 1,
2015, are not relevant to this case.
19Contrary to the State's contention, the legislative
history does not support reading HRS § 844D-35 to apply to Dunbar
after his probation for the felony offense had been discharged.
5.  2015 Proposed Legislation
Finally, in support of its arguments, the State points
to proposed amendments to HRS § 844D-35 in 2015 that were not
adopted.  The State argues that the 2015 proposed legislation
clarifies the legislative intent for HRS § 844D-35.  We do not
agree with the State's contention.
In the 2015 legislative session, Senate Bill No. 211
originally contained the following proposed amendments to HRS   
§ 844D-35:18
"[[]§844D-35[]] Collection from persons on probation,
parole, or other release.  (a) A person, except for any
juvenile, shall provide buccal swab samples and print
impressions and, if required pursuant to this chapter, blood
specimens if:
(1) The person is on probation [ or], parole, or other 
    release, including final unconditional release     
    upon satisfaction of the person's criminal             
        sentence, for any [felony] criminal offense,       
      whether or not [that crime or] the offense is one  
        set forth in section 844D-31(a)[."]  
  
  
  
A report by the Senate Committee on Judiciary and Labor for
Senate Bill No. 211 states that the purpose of these proposed
amendments to HRS § 844D-35 was to "[s]pecify the requirements of
DNA sample collection from criminal offenders that are released
on parole, probation, or other release[.]"  S. Stand. Comm. Rep.
No. 662, in 2015 Senate Journal, at 1096.  The Committee report
further states, however, that these proposed amendments were
being deleted from the bill "because the clarification under [HRS 
§ 844D-35] is not necessary[.]"  Id.  at 1097.  Thus, HRS § 844D-
35 was left in its original form, as passed ten years previously
in 2005.FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
With regard to the use of subsequent legislation in 
interpreting statutes, "[t]here are no principles of construction 
which prevent the utilization by the courts of subsequent enactments or amendments as an aid in arriving at the correct meaning of a prior statute, and it is very common for a court, in construing a statute, to refer to subsequent legislation as impliedly confirming the view which the court has decided to adopt. Gomes v. Campbell, 37 Haw. 252, 257 (Haw. Terr. 
1945)(quoting 50 Am. Jur. Statutes, § 337); see also Hawaii Providers Network v. AIG Ins. Co., 105 Hawai
'i 362, 370 n.19, 98 
P.3d 233, 241 n.19 (2004) ("It is important to note that while arguments predicated upon subsequent legislative actions must be weighed with extreme care, they should not be rejected out of hand as a source that a court may consider in the search for legislative intent.") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); State v. Dudoit, 90 Hawai
'i 262, 268 n.3, 978 P.2d 700, 
706 n.3 (1999) ("This court employs subsequent legislative history only to confirm its interpretation of an earlier statutory provision.") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
Here, the 2015 legislative action (the introduction but
 
eventual deletion of an amendment to HRS § 844D-35) does not
 serve to confirm our interpretation of the statute or otherwise
 provide alternative guidance. In particular, it does not
 establish an intent under HRS § 844D-35, adopted in 2005, to
 allow collection of DNA samples from a felon who had been
 discharged from probation. Importantly, in 2015, the Legislature
 as a whole did not act with regard to HRS § 844D-35 and there was
 no legislation adopted related to that provision. See Lockhart
 
v. U.S., 546 U.S. 142, 147 (2005)("[F]ailed legislative proposals
 are a particularly dangerous ground on which to rest an
 interpretation of a prior statute.")(citations and internal
 quotation marks omitted); People v. Mendoza, 4 P.3d 265, 284
 (Cal. 2000)("We can rarely determine from the failure of the
 
20
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Legislature to pass a particular bill what the intent of the
 
Legislature is with respect to existing law.")(citation and
 footnote omitted). Additionally, even if we consider the 2015
 legislative activity related to HRS § 844D-35, there is no clear
 intent as to existing law. It is possible that the 2015 proposed
 amendments to HRS § 844D-35 were an effort to address perceived
 ambiguities in the statute. Nonetheless, the brief statement in
 the Committee report that clarification of HRS § 844D-35 is "not
 necessary" does not show that the existing statute should be read
 in the manner urged by the State.
 
We conclude that the 2015 proposed amendments to HRS 
§ 844D-35 do not assist in interpreting the existing statute in
 this case.
 
6. Summary
 
Having considered the language of HRS § 844D-35, its 
title, the other provisions within HRS Chapter 844D Part III in context, the relevant legislative history for HRS Chapter 844D Part III, and the 2015 proposed legislative amendments to HRS § 844D-35, we conclude that the circuit court properly dismissed the charge in this case. HRS § 844D-35 did not provide for the collection of Dunbar's buccal swab sample after he was discharged from probation for his 2005 felony offense. Although the statute may be ambiguous as to subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2), our foremost obligation is "to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature." Kelekolio, 94 Hawai
'i at 356, 14 
P.3d at 366 (citation omitted). Considering all of the factors for interpreting HRS § 844D-35, including first and foremost the language of the statute, the circuit court properly determined the legislative intent was to set forth the process and circumstances for the collection of DNA samples, and that this process did not include collection of Dunbar's buccal swab sample under the circumstances of this case.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
C. Dunbar's Fourth Amendment Argument
 
In his Answering Brief, Dunbar contends that if HRS
 
§ 844D-35 is interpreted to apply to him even after he had
 
completed his probation, the collection of his DNA sample would
 be a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights protecting him from
 unreasonable searches and seizures. Given our ruling above, we
 do not reach this issue.
 
IV. Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the Circuit Court of
 
the Second Circuit's dismissal of the charge against Dunbar in
 this case.
