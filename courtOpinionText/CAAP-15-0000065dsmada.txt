KEVIN T. WILSON, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P. NO. 15-1-0002; CR. NO. 14-1-0187)
 
ORDER GRANTING IN PART THE JUNE 22, 2015 MOTION TO DISMISS
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the Motion to Dismiss (Motion), 
filed June 22, 2015, by Petitioner-Appellant Kevin T. Wilson 
(Appellant), pro se, the papers in support, and the record, it appears that (1) the appeal was docketed March 12, 2015; (2) Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 42(b) authorizes 
the court to dismiss a docketed appeal upon a motion; and (3) Appellant seeks to dismiss this appeal from the circuit court's denial of his petition for post-conviction relief without  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
prejudice because he filed the petition, and this appeal, under
 
the mistaken belief that his court-appointed counsel did not file
 a notice of appeal in his underlying criminal conviction, when in
 fact counsel filed a notice of appeal and the appeal is pending.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is
 
granted in part and the appeal is dismissed.
