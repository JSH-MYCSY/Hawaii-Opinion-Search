PIERRE HERNANDEZ, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(HONOLULU DIVISION)

(CASE NO. 1DCW-14-0005133)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Pierre Hernandez (Hernandez)
 
appeals from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order entered
 
on January 7, 2015 (Judgment), by the District Court of the First
 
1
Circuit, Honolulu Division (District Court),  after the District
Court accepted Hernandez's no contest plea on the charge of
 
Harassment by Stalking in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes
 ยง 711-1106-6.5 (2014). Hernandez's plea was made pursuant to his
 Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 43 Plea by mail in which

his lawyer to represent him without his presence, and gave up his
 
right to be questioned in open court.
 
On appeal, Hernandez contends that the District Court 
plainly erred because the District Court did not personally address him regarding the possibility of being deported as a consequence of his plea and did not personally address him as to his right of allocution prior to sentencing. However, Hernandez's claims are not jurisdictional, he filed no motion to withdraw his plea, and his no contest plea was not conditional. Thus, Hernandez is precluded from "later asserting any nonjurisdictional claims [to his no contest plea], including constitutional challenges to the pretrial proceedings." State v. 
Morin, 71 Haw. 159, 162-63, 785 P.2d 1316, 1318-19 (1990); see also Schwartz v. State, 136 Hawai
'i 258, 281, 361 P.3d 1161, 1184 
(2015) (citing Morin, 71 Haw. at 162, 785 P.2d at 1318). 
Accordingly, the District Court's January 7, 2015
 
Judgment is affirmed.
