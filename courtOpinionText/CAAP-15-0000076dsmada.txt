APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Upon review of the record on appeal, it appears that we 
lack appellate jurisdiction over this appeal that 
Plaintiffs/Petitioners/Appellants Japan Business Service Co., Ltd.; ASI Hawaii, Inc.; and Japan Airport Service Co., Ltd. have asserted from the Honorable Karl K. Sakamoto's January 14, 2015 "Final Judgment in Civil No. 12-1-3292-12 (KKS)" and January 14, 2015 "Final Judgment in Civil No. 12-1-3292-12 (KKS)" because the said judgments do not satisfy the requirements for an appealable final judgment under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2014), Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP), and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
HRS § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2014) authorizes appeals 
from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of 
Civil Procedure (HRCP) HRCP Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." HRCP Rule 58 (emphasis added). The Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has held that 
"[a]n appeal may be taken from circuit court orders resolving claims against parties only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[ .]" Id. 
[I]f a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a case
involving multiple claims or multiple parties, the judgment
(a) must specifically identify the party or parties for and
against whom the judgment is entered, and (b) must (i) identify
the claims for which it is entered, and (ii) dismiss any claims
not specifically identified[.]
 
Id. at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4. When interpreting
 
-2­ NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the requirements for a judgment under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme
 
Court of Hawai 'i noted that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face all of
the issues in the case, the burden of searching the often
voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions of
jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the parties nor
counsel have a right to cast upon this court the burden of
searching a voluminous record for evidence of finality[.]
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (original emphasis). 
"[A]n appeal from any judgment will be dismissed as premature if 
the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. (original emphasis). 
Additionally, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has explained that, 
[a] statement that declares “there are no other outstanding
claims” is not a judgment. If the circuit court intends that
claims other than those listed in the judgment language should be
dismissed, it must say so: for example,
 
“Defendant Y's counterclaim is dismissed,” or
“Judgment upon Defendant Y's counterclaim is entered
in favor of Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z,” or “all
other claims, counterclaims, and cross-claims are
dismissed.”
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119–20 n. 4, 869 P.2d at 1338–39 n.4. 
The instant appeal involves two civil cases-­
S.P. No. 13-1-0221 and Civ. No. 12-1-3292--that the circuit court 
consolidated into a single case. "[C]onsolidation for convenience pursuant to HRCP Rule 42(a) also causes the cases to merge into one for purposes of determining finality of judgment." Leslie v. 
Estate of Tavares, 109 Hawai
'i 8, 12, 122 P.3d 803, 807 (2005). 
Thus, in a consolidated circuit court civil case, the circuit court must enter a single judgment that resolves all claims as to all parties in all of the cases that the circuit court has consolidated, consistent with HRCP Rule 58 and Jenkins, unless 
-3­  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the circuit court certifies the judgment (on fewer than all 
claims) for appeal pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b). Leslie, 109 Hawai
'i 13, 122 P.3d 808 ("[A] judgment or order in a 
consolidated case, disposing of fewer than all claims among all parties, is not appealable in the absence of [HRCP] Rule 54(b) certification."). 
In the instant case, the circuit court separately filed
 
four judgments: the January 14, 2015, 10:27 a.m. "Final Judgment
 in S.P. No. 13-1-0221 (KKS)" that addressed only S.P. No. 13-1­0221 (Judgment 1); the January 14, 2015, 10:28 a.m. "Final
 
Judgment in Civil No. 12-1-3292-12 (KKS)" that addressed only
 
1
Civ. No. 12-1-3292 (Judgment 2);  the January 14, 2015 10:31 a.m.
"Final Judgment in S.P. No. 13-1-0221 (KKS)" that addressed only
 
2
S.P. No. 13-1-0221 (Judgment 3);  and the January 14, 2015, 10:32
a.m. "Final Judgment in Civil No. 12-1-3292-12 (KKS)" that also
 
addressed only Civ. No. 12-1-3292 (Judgment 4). S.P. No. 13-1­
0221 and Civ. No. 12-1-3292 constitute one consolidated case, but
 
there is no single judgment that disposes of all of the claims in
 consolidated S.P. No. 13-1-0221 and Civ. No. 12-1-3292, and the
 statement in each judgment that "there are no remaining claims"
 does not serve to dismiss all remaining claims in the
 consolidated case of S.P. No. 13-1-0221 and Civ. No. 12-1-3292.

 This appears to be a duplicate (bearing the stamped name and seal of
the circuit court) of the January 14, 2015, 10:32 a.m. "Final Judgment in
Civil No. 12-1-3292-12 (KKS)" that addressed only Civ. 12-1-3292 (Judgment 4)
and bears the handwritten signature of the circuit court.

Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119–20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338–39 n.4. 
Furthermore, none of the judgments includes an express finding of 
no just reason for delay in the entry of judgment on one or more but fewer than all claims pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b). Hence, none of the judgments satisfies the requirements for an appealable final judgment under HRCP Rule 58 and the holdings in Jenkins and Leslie. Absent an appealable final judgment, the appellate court lacks jurisdiction over the appeal. 
THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
 
case number CAAP-15-0000076 is dismissed for lack of
 jurisdiction.
