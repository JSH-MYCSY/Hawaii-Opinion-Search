APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 05-1-2246-12)

 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Third-Party Defendant/Appellant Alexander Y. Marn
 
(Marn) appeals pro se from the "Order Granting Plaintiff McCully
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Associates' Motion for Writ of Execution, Filed January 6, 2015"1
 
entered on February 11, 2015 in the Circuit Court of the First
 
2
Circuit  (circuit court).
 
On appeal, Marn contends the circuit court erred in
 
"ruling that [his] motion for relief from writ of execution,
 
filed May 7, 2015 was denied outright without [a] hearing" and
 "confirming the writ and sale of the Ekela Property, filed August
 26, 2015."

I. BACKGROUND
 
This appeal stems from a lawsuit that Plaintiff/
 
Appellee McCully Associates, by and through Thomas E. Hayes,
 Receiver Pendente Lite of McCully Associates through its general
 partner Ala Wai Investments, Inc. (Receiver Hayes), filed against
 
Defendants/Appellees Ten Grand Associates, a Hawaii limited
 
partnership, and Ten Grand Investments, Inc., a Hawaii
 corporation (together, Ten Grand). The nature of the underlying
 
lawsuit is not at issue in the current appeal. Rather, the
 
relevant history of this appeal begins with monetary judgments
 
4
that the circuit court entered on September 16, 2009  and
5 6 
November 12, 2009  (together, Ten Grand Judgments).  The circuit
 
court entered the Ten Grand Judgments in favor of McCully
 Associates and against Ten Grand, and also in favor of Ronald K.

 Marn's notice of appeal also lists a "Notice of Pendency of
Action" filed by Plaintiff-Appellee McCully Associates on January 7, 2015.
Appeals in civil matter may only be from "final judgments, orders, or decrees
of circuit and district courts and the land court to the intermediate
 appellate court[.]" Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 641-1(a) (Supp. 2015).

 The Honorable Rhonda A. Nishimura presided, unless otherwise
indicated.

 Marn also challenges this court's order denying his motion for
stay, entered on September 10, 2015. We note, however, that in order for Marnto appeal our decision, he was required to submit an application for a writ ofcertiorari to the Hawai' i Supreme Court, pursuant to Hawaii Rules of Appellate
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 40.1. 
4
 Marn filed a notice of appeal from the circuit court's September
16, 2009 Final Judgment on October 15, 2009.
 
5
 The record on appeal does not indicate that Marn appealed from the
circuit court's November 12, 2009 Judgment.

 The Honorable Victoria S. Marks presided over the Ten Grand
Judgments.

Kotoshirodo, as receiver for Ten Grand (Receiver Kotoshirodo) and
 
against Marn, as a third-party defendant. On May 9, 2014,
 
Receiver Kotoshirodo assigned all the judgments that Ten Grand
 held against Marn to Receiver Hayes, as receiver for McCully
 Associates.
 
On January 6, 2015, after Marn failed to make any
 
payments, Receiver Hayes filed "Plaintiff McCully Associates'
 Motion for Writ of Execution" (Motion for Writ of Execution),
 
which requested the circuit court place a levy on Marn's property
 
located on Ekela Avenue in Honolulu (Ekela Property) and order
 
the sale of the Ekela Property to the highest bidder to satisfy
 
various monetary judgments that McCully Associates held against
 Marn. Specifically, McCully Associates' Motion for Writ of
 Execution sought satisfaction of the Ten Grand Judgments and an
 October 25, 2010 Partial Final Judgment that the circuit court
 entered in favor of McCully Associates and against Marn. The
 October 25, 2010 Partial Final Judgment was not entered in the
 case before us. Instead, the October 25, 2010 Partial Final
 Judgment was entered in a separate, although related, case: In re
 Marn Family Litigation, Master File No. 00-1-MFL 3RD, Civil No.
 98-5371-12 and 98-4706-10.
 
Marn did not file a written opposition to the Motion
 
for Writ to Execution, but the circuit court nevertheless allowed
 Marn to "make a few points" during the January 29, 2015 hearing
 on the motion.
 
On February 11, 2015, the circuit court entered an
 
order granting McCully Associates' Motion for Writ of Execution
 (Order Granting Motion for Writ of Execution). The circuit court
 
ordered:
 
3. The Director of Public Safety of the State of
Hawaii, his/her deputy or any policy officer or other person
authorized by the laws of the State of Hawaii Director, is
ordered (a) to levy upon the personal property of and the
real property of Defendant [Marn] located at [the Ekela
Property] and (b) to sell the Ekela Property after thirty
(30) days previous notice as required by law to the
highest bidder, to include [McCully Associates] by credit
bid, in order to satisfy [McCully Associates'] Judgments
rendered against Defendant [Marn] filed September 16, 2009,
November 12, 2009, and October 25, 2010, in favor of
[McCully Associates] for $10,676,768.35, costs of court
inclusive, collecting also the legal interest from date of
the Writ, and all costs, and expenses of levy, advertisement

and sale[.]
 
On February 11, 2015, the circuit court issued a Writ of
 
Execution.
 
On February 17, 2015, Marn filed a notice of appeal
 
from the circuit court's Order Granting Motion for Writ of
 Execution.
 
II. DISCUSSION
 
Marn contends the circuit court erred in denying his
 
May 7, 2015 motion related to a request for relief from the Writ
 of Execution. In addition, Marn seeks to challenge the circuit
 court's August 26, 2015 "Order Granting Plaintiffs' Motion to
 Confirm (1) Return of Writ of Execution, and (2) Sale Filed June
 26, 2015."
 
Notwithstanding Marn's attachments to his opening brief 
and his various other submissions on appeal, the orders that Marn apparently seeks to challenge are not referenced in his notice of appeal and are not included in the record on appeal or any supplemental record on appeal.
7 "The law is clear in this 
jurisdiction that the appellant has the burden of furnishing the appellate court with a sufficient record to positively show the alleged error." Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai
'i 225, 230, 
909 P.2d 553, 558 (1995) (quoting Union Bldg. Materials Corp. v. Kakaako Corp., 5 Haw. App. 146, 151, 682 P.2d 82, 87 (1984)); see HRAP Rule 10 (setting forth the various items that an appellant must include in the record on appeal). We have no basis upon which to review the circuit court's decisions and, therefore, Marn's appeal is without merit.
III. CONCLUSION
 
Therefore, the "Order Granting Plaintiff McCully
 
Associates' Motion for Writ of Execution, Filed January 6, 2015"
 
7
 Even if Marn had filed an amended notice of appeal to include the
challenged orders and even if Marn included a complete record on appeal,
Marn's February 17, 2015 Notice of Appeal predated the subject orders."[S]ince an amended notice of appeal relates back to the notice of appeal itpurports to amend, it does not appeal an order, judgment, or decree enteredsubsequent to the notice of appeal it purports to amend." Enos v. Pac. 
Transfer & Warehouse, Inc., 80 Hawai' i 345, 355-56, 910 P.2d 116, 126-27
(1996) (quoting Chan v. Chan, 7 Haw. App. 122, 128, 748 P.2d 807, 811 (1987)).
