IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
YURIE YAMANO, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
DOCTOR KEIICHI KOBAYASHI, AND
DOCTOR KATIE HUANG, Defendants-Appellees
 
IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 14-1-2135-10 RAN)

 
ORDER GRANTING APRIL 1, 2015 MOTION TO
DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION

 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Upon review of (1) Defendant-Appellee Katie Huang,

 
M.D.'s (Appellee Dr. Huang), April 1, 2015 motion to dismiss
 
appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction, (2) Defendant-Appellee
 Keichi Kobayashi, M.D.'s (Appellee Dr. Kobayashi), joinder in
 Appellee Dr. Huang's April 1, 2015 motion, (3) the lack of any
 memorandum by Plaintiff-Appellant Yurie Yamano (Appellant Yamano)
 in opposition to Appellee Dr. Huang's April 1, 2015 motion, and
 (4) the record, it appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction
 over this appeal that Appellant Yamano has asserted from the
 Honorable Rhonda A. Nishimura's February 3, 2015 order and
 February 4, 2015 order dismissing Appellant Yamano's complaint,
 because the circuit court has not yet reduced these two
 interlocutory orders to a separate judgment document.
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 641-1(a) (1993 & 
Supp. 2014) authorizes appeals to the Hawai
'i Intermediate Court 
of Appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by 
the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). Rule 58 of the Hawai 'i 
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." Based on this requirement under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has 
held that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 
Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). "Thus, based on 
Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 
Hawai
'i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008); Alford v. City and 
Count of Honolulu, 109 Hawai 'i 14, 20, 122 P.3d 809, 815 (2005) 
("[A]n order disposing of a circuit court case is appealable when the order is reduced to a separate judgment." (Citation omitted; emphasis added)). When interpreting the requirement under HRCP Rule 58 for a separate judgment document that, on its face, resolves all claims against all parties, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i noted that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality, . . . and we should not make such searches
necessary by allowing the parties the option of waiving the
requirements of HRCP [Rule] 58.
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (original emphasis). 
Consequently, "[a]n appeal from an order that is not reduced to a 
judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Id. at 120, 869 
P.2d at 1339 (footnote omitted). 
The February 3, 2015 order and February 4, 2015 order
 
dismissing Appellant Yamano's complaint are interlocutory orders. 
On March 30, 2015, the circuit court clerk entered the record on
 appeal for appellate court case number CAAP-15-0000090, which
 does not contain a separate judgment, as HRS § 641-1(a) and HRCP
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Rule 58 require under the holding in Jenkins. Although 
exceptions to the final judgment requirement exist under the doctrine in Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848) (the Forgay doctrine), the collateral order doctrine, and HRS § 641-1(b) (1993 & Supp. 2014), the February 3, 2015 order and February 4, 2015 order dismissing Appellant Yamano's complaint do not satisfy the requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine, the collateral order doctrine, and HRS § 641-1(b). See Ciesla v. 
Reddish, 78 Hawai
'i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) (regarding 
the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai
'i 
319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding the three requirements for the collateral order doctrine); HRS § 641-1(b) (regarding the requirements for an appeal from an interlocutory order). Absent an appealable final judgment, we lack appellate jurisdiction, and Appellant Yamano's appeal is premature. Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellee Dr. Huang's April 1,
 
2015 motion to dismiss appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction
 is granted, and appellate court case number CAAP-15-0000090 is
 dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
