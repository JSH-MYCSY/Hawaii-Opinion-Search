(4) Appellant did not file either document; 
(5) On June 4, 2015, the appellate clerk notified 
Appellant, through Counsel, that the time for filing the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief had expired and, pursuant to Hawai

the matter would be called to the court’s attention on June 15, 2015, for such action as the court deems proper, which could include dismissal; 
(6) Thereafter, Appellant did not file the statement of
 
jurisdiction or opening brief, or respond to the default notice; 
(7) Although Appellant filed the notice of appeal pro
 
se, he is represented by Counsel in this appeal, and the
 Judiciary Information Management System reflects Counsel was
 electronically served with each document filed in this appeal;
 and
 
(8) Neither Counsel nor Appellant have filed in this
 
appeal a motion to withdraw or discharge Counsel, pursuant to
 HRAP Rule 50.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed.
