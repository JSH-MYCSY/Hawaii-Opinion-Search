IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
PAT ROCCO, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
KALAPANA SEAVIEW ESTATES COMMUNITY
 
ASSOCIATION, Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 3RC13-1-000589)

 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Pat Rocco (Rocco) appeals pro se
 
from the Judgment entered on February 4, 2015 in the District
 
1
Court of the Third Circuit  (district court).
 
On appeal, Rocco seeks a new trial due to his lawyer's

 
"ineptness" before the district court.
I. BACKGROUND
 
On July 8, 2013, Rocco filed a complaint for
 
indemnification (Complaint) in the district court against
 
Defendant-Appellee Kalapana Seaview Estates Community Association
 
(KSECA). Rocco alleged that he was a property owner and member
 
of the KSECA. The Complaint states, "Rocco spent monies to hire
 
counsel, to advise him on matters of the association, when
 [KSECA], among others, attempted to remove him as President [of
 KSECA] at illegally constituted meetings that did not comply with
 the bylaw provisions of [KSECA]." Throughout the proceedings at
 district court, Rocco was represented by counsel.
 
Trial took place in the district court on September 15,

2014, October 24, 2014, December 19, 2014, and January 23, 2015. 
The district court entered its Judgment on February 4, 2015,
 which stated:
 
Based on the testimony presented and the documents admitted
at trial, this Court makes the following findings:
 
[Rocco's] action of seeking a legal opinion pertaining
to the December 9, 2012 board meeting [for KSECA] and the
costs incurred for that opinion was neither reasonable nor
necessarily incurred by [Rocco] in his capacity as [KSECA's]
President. In addition, [Rocco's] action is a not [sic] in
the nature of indemnification.
 
THEREFORE, JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF [KSECA].
 
Rocco filed his notice of appeal from the Judgment on February
 
23, 2015.
 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 
28(b)(4)(D) provides that "[p]oints not presented in accordance with [HRAP Rule 28(b)] will be disregarded, except that the appellate court, at its option, may notice a plain error not presented." 
III. DISCUSSION
 
In his opening brief, Rocco states that he, "knowing 
that a new trial could bring things right, . . . is seeking justice in the Court of Appeal . . . ." The basis for a new trial is, according to Rocco, due to "[t]he compellation [sic] of a tricky lawyer [KSEAC] hired and the total ineptness of the lawyer that [he] hired." Rocco seems to be asserting an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in this civil suit. Under both the Hawai
'i Constitution and the United States 
Constitution, the right to the effective assistance of counsel applies only in criminal proceedings. U.S. Const. Amend. VI;

proceedings."); State v. Severino, 56 Haw. 378, 380, 537 P.2d
 
1187, 1189 (1975) ("Under both the Hawaii State and Federal
 Constitutions, an accused has the right to assistance of counsel
 'in all criminal prosecutions.'"). Rocco's argument regarding
 ineffective assistance of counsel is without merit. 
Rocco may also be attempting to assert a legal
 
malpractice claim against his trial counsel. 
The elements of an action for legal malpractice are:
(1) the parties had an attorney-client relationship, (2) the
defendant committed a negligent act or omission constituting
breach of that duty, (3) there is a causal connection
between the breach and the plaintiff's injury, and (4) the
plaintiff suffered actual loss or damages.

2001); 7 Am. Jur. 2d Attorneys at Law ยง 223 (2007)). Legal malpractice is a separate cause of action, not a basis for appeal. See e.g., Thomas, 126 Hawai
'i at 126-27, 267 P.3d at 
1231-32. 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
Therefore, the Judgment entered on February 4, 2015 in
 
the District Court of the Third Circuit is affirmed.
