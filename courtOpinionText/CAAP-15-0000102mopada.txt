MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Monica Ewalani Bernardino
 
(Bernardino) appeals pro se from the "Order Denying
 
[Bernardino's] Motion; [Hawai 'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP)], 
Rule 59. New Trials; Amendment of Judgment; and From Judgment,
 
Notice of Entry of Judgment Entered; 6/23/2014; and HRCP, Rule

of Judgment Entered 6/13/2012," entered on January 26, 2015 in
 
1
the Circuit Court of the First Circuit  (circuit court).
 
On appeal, Bernardino contends the circuit court erred
 
2
in denying her relief pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b)(4)  because the
circuit court's judgment confirming the sale of the foreclosed
 property is (1) "void for lack of service of Complaint and
 Summons" and (2) void where the motion for summary judgment of
 Plaintiff-Appellee U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee, on
 Behalf of the Holders of the Asset Backed Securities Corporation
 Home Equity Loan Trust, Series AMQ 2006-HE7 Asset Backed Pass-
Through Certificates, Series AMQ 2006-HE7 (U.S. Bank) was "not
 
properly supported [as it contained] [n]o written authority for
 
Agent executing Assignment of Mortgage." Bernardino also argues
 that the circuit court erred in denying her relief pursuant to
 
3
HRCP Rule 59(e)  because (1) the judgment confirming the sale of
1 The Honorable Bert I. Ayabe presided. 
2 HRCP Rule 60(b) provides, in relevant part: 
Rule 60. RELIEF FROM JUDGMENT OR ORDER. 
. . . .
 (b) Mistakes; inadvertence; excusable neglect; newly
discovered evidence; fraud, etc. On motion and upon such
terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or a
party's legal representative from a final judgment, order,
or proceeding for the following reasons: (1) mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly
discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have
been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule
 59(b); (3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic
or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an
adverse party; (4) the judgment is void; (5) the judgment
has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or a prior
judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or
otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the
judgment should have prospective application; or (6) any
other reason justifying relief from the operation of the
judgment. The motion shall be made within a reasonable time,
and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) not more than one year
after the judgment, order, or proceeding was entered or
taken.

       NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the foreclosed property is "void for lack of service of complaint
 
and summons" and (2) U.S. Bank was not entitled to a writ of
 ejectment when it did not request such relief in its Complaint.

I. BACKGROUND
 
On August 11, 2006, Bernardino executed a promissory
 
note (Note) to Argent Mortgage Company, LLC (Argent) for the
 
principal sum of $352,500. As security for the Note, Bernardino
 
executed a mortgage (Mortgage) on the subject property (Property)
 
in favor of Argent as mortgagee. The Note and Mortgage were
 
assigned to U.S. Bank through an Assignment of Mortgage (AOM)
 
dated August 18, 2006. The AOM was recorded in the Office of the
 
Assistant Registrar of the Land Court of the State of Hawaii on
 June 21, 2007.
 
On April 28, 2011, U.S. Bank filed its "Complaint to
 
Foreclose Mortgage" (Complaint), which sought to foreclose on the
 
Property because Bernardino defaulted on her scheduled Mortgage
 
payments. A Return and Acknowledgment of Service (Return of
 
Acknowledgment), filed on May 11, 2011, indicates that U.S. Bank
 
personally served Bernardino with a copy of the Complaint on May
 
6, 2011. Bernardino failed to answer, plead, or otherwise defend
 against U.S. Bank's Complaint, so on June 20, 2011, the circuit
 court clerk entered default against Bernardino pursuant to HRCP
 Rule 55(a).

3(...continued)
 
(e) Motion to alter or amend judgment. Any motion to
alter or amend a judgment shall be filed no later than 10
days after entry of the judgment.
 
4
 To aid in the clarity of this opinion, we have altered the order
in which we address Bernardino's points on appeal. 
5
 HRCP Rule 55(a) provides:
 
Rule 55. DEFAULT.
 
(a) Entry. When a party against whom a judgment for
affirmative relief is sought has failed to plead or
otherwise defend as provided by these rules and that fact is
made to appear by affidavit or otherwise, the clerk shall
enter the party's default.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On February 15, 2012, U.S. Bank filed "[U.S. Bank's]
 
Motion for Summary Judgment, and for Interlocutory Decree of
 
Foreclosure Against All Parties" (MSJ). On February 28, 2012,
 
Bernardino filed her opposition to U.S. Bank's MSJ. On June 13,
 
2012, the circuit court granted U.S. Bank's MSJ in its "Findings
 of Fact; Conclusions of Law; Order Granting [U.S. Bank's] Motion
 for Summary Judgment, and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure
 Against All Parties" (FOF/COL), thereby foreclosing on the
 
Property and appointing a commissioner (Commissioner) to oversee
 
the sale of the Property. The circuit court entered its judgment
 
for the decree of foreclosure on the same day (Judgment).
 
On January 21, 2014, the Commissioner conducted a
 
public auction of the Property in which U.S. Bank was the highest
 bidder. On January 27, 2014, Bernardino filed a motion to
 dismiss U.S. Bank's Complaint pursuant to HRCP Rule 12(b)(1)
 (Motion to Dismiss). Bernardino argued that the circuit court
 
lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the initial foreclosure
 
action. On February 20, 2014, U.S. Bank filed "[U.S. Bank's] 
Motion for Confirmation of Sale, Distribution of Proceeds, and
 for Writ of Ejectment." On March 28, 2014, U.S. Bank filed its
 opposition to Bernardino's HRCP Rule 12(b)(1) Motion to Dismiss.
 
On June 23, 2014, the circuit court entered orders
 
granting U.S. Bank's motion for confirmation of sale and writ of
 ejectment (Order Confirming Sale/Writ of Ejectment) and denying
 
Bernardino's HRCP Rule 12(b)(1) Motion to Dismiss. The circuit
 
court entered a writ of ejectment against Bernardino on the same
 day.
 
On July 3, 2014, Bernardino moved for relief from the
 
circuit court's FOF/COL, Judgment, and Order Confirming Sale/Writ
 of Ejectment pursuant to HRCP Rule 59(e) and HRCP Rule 60(b)(4)
 (Motion for Relief). In her Motion for Relief, Bernardino argued
 
that she was entitled to relief under HRCP Rule 60(b)(4) because
 
the circuit court's FOF/COL and Judgment were void where (1)
 service of process was insufficient and (2) the documents U.S.
 Bank attached to its MSJ did not support summary judgment.
 Bernardino also argued that she was entitled to relief under HRCP
 
4
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Rule 59(e) because the circuit court erred in (1) entering its
 
Order Confirming Sale/Writ of Ejectment when service of U.S.
 Bank's Complaint and summons was improper and (2) issuing U.S.
 Bank's writ of ejectment where U.S. Bank's "[Complaint did] not
 request a Writ of Possession or Writ of Ejectment" and where such
 relief was "not authorized by the [circuit court's Order
 Confirming Sale/Writ of Ejectment.]" U.S. Bank filed its
 opposition to Bernardino's Motion for Relief on December 1, 2014. 
The circuit court held a hearing on the Motion for
 
Relief on December 9, 2014 and entered an order denying the
 motion on January 26, 2015. Bernardino filed her notice of
 appeal on February 25, 2015.
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
A. HRCP Rule 60(b)
 
"The circuit court's disposition of an HRCP Rule 60(b)
 
motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion." Beneficial Hawai 'i, 
Inc. v. Casey, 98 Hawai 'i 159, 164, 45 P.3d 359, 364 (2002). 
The trial court abuses its discretion if it bases its ruling
on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous
assessment of the evidence. Stated differently, an abuse of
discretion occurs where the trial court has clearly exceeded
the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles of
law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party
litigant.
 
Id. (quoting Molinar v. Schweizer, 95 Hawai 'i 331, 335, 22 P.3d 
978, 982 (2001)). 
HRCP Rule 60(b)(4) relief requires the trial court to 
determine whether a judgment is void. HRCP Rule 60(b)(4). 
Because such a determination is not a discretionary issue, we review the trial court's determination that a judgment is void de novo. Cvitanovich-Dubie v. Dubie, 125 Hawai
'i 128, 139, 254 P.3d 
439, 450 (2011); Wagner v. World Botanical Gardens, Inc., 126 Hawai
'i 190, 195, 268 P.3d 443, 448 (App. 2011).6 
6
 We note that HRCP Rule 60(b) is substantially similar to Hawai' i 
Family Court Rules Rule 60(b) and materially similar to the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure (FRCP) Rule 60(b). Wagner, 126 Hawai' i at 194 n.3, 268 P.3d
at 447 n.3. This court has held that "treatises and cases interpreting HFCRRule 60(b) and FRCP Rule 60(b) are persuasive for purposes of interpretingHRCP Rule 60(b)." Id.; see Cvitanovich–Dubie, 125 Hawai' i at 147 n.23, 254
P.3d at 458 n.23 (2011). 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
B. HRCP Rule 59(e)
 
A motion made pursuant to HRCP Rule 59(e) to alter or
 
amend the judgment is reviewed under the abuse of discretion
 
standard. Gossinger v. Ass'n of Apartment Owners of the Regency
 
of Ala Wai, 73 Haw. 412, 425, 835 P.2d 627, 634 (1992).
III. DISCUSSION
 
A. HRCP Rule 60(b)
 
Bernardino contends the circuit court erred in denying 
her Motion for Relief because she was entitled to relief under HRCP Rule 60(b)(4). A motion made pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b)(4) "differs from the other five clauses of [HRCP Rule 60]" in that "[i]t does not involve a question of judicial discretion, does not require the moving party to show a meritorious defense, and is not restricted by a reasonable time requirement." Calasa v. 
Greenwell, 2 Haw. App. 395, 397, 633 P.2d 553, 555 (1981); see 11 Wright, Miller & Kane, Federal Practice & Procedure: Civil 3d § 2862, at 431-33 (2012) (noting that the "reasonable time" requirement cannot be enforced with regard to a Rule 60(b)(4) motion, although it "seems literally to apply to motions under Rule 60(b)(4)"). HRCP Rule 60(b)(4) provides that "[o]n motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or a party's legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: . . . (4) the judgment is void[.]" "A judgment is void only if the court that rendered it lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter, or of the parties, or if it acted in a manner inconsistent with due process of law." Wagner, 126 Hawai
'i at 195, 268 P.3d at 448 (quoting In re 
Genesys Data Techs., Inc., 95 Hawai 'i 33, 38, 18 P.3d 895, 900 
(2001)). 
First, Bernardino argues that the circuit court's June 
13, 2012 FOF/COL and Judgment are void because of insufficient service of process. "In order for a trial court to exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant, the defendant must be served with a copy of the summons and the complaint pursuant to HRCP Rule 4(d)." Wagner, 126 Hawai
'i at 195, 268 P.3d at 448 
6
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(quoting Citicorp Mortg., Inc. v. Bartolome, 94 Hawai 'i 422, 430, 
16 P.3d 827, 835 (App. 2000)). HRCP Rule 4(d) provides:
 
Rule 4 PROCESS.
 
. . . .
 
(d) Same: Personal service.  The summons and complaint
shall be served together. The plaintiff shall furnish the
person making service with such copies as are necessary.
Service shall be made as follows:
 
(1) Upon an individual other than an infant or an
incompetent person, (A) by delivering a copy of the summons
and of the complaint to the individual personally or in case
the individual cannot be found by leaving copies thereof at
the individual's dwelling house or usual place of abode with
some person of suitable age and discretion then residing
therein or (B) by delivering a copy of the summons and of
the complaint to an agent authorized by appointment or by
law to receive service of process.
 
The defense of insufficient service of process can be waived. 
Cf. Rearden Family Tr. v. Wisenbaker,  101 Hawai 'i 237, 247, 65 
P.3d 1029, 1039 (2003).
 
The Return of Acknowledgment indicates that Bernardino
 
was personally served a copy of the Complaint and summons on May
 
6, 2011, but contains no signature on the line stating "signature
 of person served." An affidavit of the independent process
 server (Process Server) who purportedly served Bernardino,
 
indicates that he served Bernardino on May 6, 2011 at the
 
Property. The affidavit states:
 
Once at address, I approached a woman at her garage door,
and asked her if her name was Monica Bernardino. That
 person unknown at that time did not confirm or, deny if she
was Monica Bernardino but received the summons, and walked
away back into her garage without any further
acknowledgment. A male individual was also observed in the
 garage area.
 
Multiple attempts in the past have been made, and were
unsuccessful. That same individual was observed on multiple
occasions at the residence through kitchen window with no
reply when attempted service through front door.
 
Bernardino claimed she was not home when the purported service
 
occurred and, therefore, service could not have happened as the
 Process Server recalled. We note that "[t]he weight and
 credibility of evidence is for the circuit court to determine and
 its findings of fact will not be set aside unless they are
 clearly erroneous." 
Beneficial Hawaii, Inc.,  98 Hawai 'i at 167, 
7

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
45 P.3d at 367 (refusing to disturb the circuit court's finding
 
that defendant was properly served with plaintiff's motion for
 summary judgment where defendant "offer[ed] no argument for why
 the circuit court's finding is clearly erroneous").
 
Even if assuming arguendo service was improper,
 
Bernardino waived her insufficient service of process argument
 when she filed multiple responses and motions, including an HRCP
 Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss complaint, during the circuit
 court proceedings without challenging U.S. Bank's service of
 process. HRCP Rule 12 provides, in pertinent part:
 
Rule 12. DEFENSES AND OBJECTIONS -- WHEN AND HOW PRESENTED
 
-- BY PLEADING OR MOTION -- MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE

 
PLEADINGS.
 
. . . .

 
(b) How presented. Every defense, in law or fact, to a
claim for relief in any pleading, whether a claim,
counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, shall be
asserted in the responsive pleading thereto if one is
required, except that the following defenses may at the
option of the pleader be made by motion: (1) lack of
jurisdiction over the subject matter, (2) lack of
jurisdiction over the person, (3) improper venue, (4)
insufficiency of process, (5) insufficiency of service of
process, (6) failure to state a claim upon which relief can
be granted, (7) failure to join a party under Rule 19. A
motion making any of these defenses shall be made before
pleading if a further pleading is permitted. No defense or
objection is waived by being joined with one or more other
defenses or objections in a responsive pleading or motion.
 
. . . .
 
(g) Consolidation of defenses in motion. A party who
makes a motion under this rule may join with it any other
motions herein provided for and then available to the party.
If a party makes a motion under this rule but omits
therefrom any defense or objection then available to the
party which this rule permits to be raised by motion, the
party shall not thereafter make a motion based on the
defense or objection so omitted, except a motion as provided
in subdivision (h)(2) hereof on any of the grounds there
stated.
 
(h) Waiver or preservation of certain defenses.
 
(1) A defense of lack of jurisdiction over the person,
improper venue, insufficiency of process, or insufficiency
of service of process is waived (A) if omitted from a motion
in the circumstances described in subdivision (g), or (B) if
it is neither made by motion under this rule nor included in
a responsive pleading or an amendment thereof permitted by
Rule 15(a) to be made as a matter of course.
 
8
  
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(Emphases added.) The defense of insufficient service of process 
is waived if omitted from a pre-answer motion or responsive pleading. HRCP Rule 12(h)(1)(A); see 5C Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 3d § 1391, at 515 (2004) ("If [a] party wishes to raise any of these [Rule 12] defenses, that must be done at the time the first significant defensive move is made--whether it be by way of a Rule 12 motion or a responsive pleading.")
. The Hawai 'i Supreme Court has maintained: 
Any time defendant makes a pre-answer Rule 12 motion, he or
she must include, on penalty of waiver, the defenses set
forth in subdivisions (2) through (5) of Rule 12(b). If one
or more of these defenses are omitted from the initial
 motion but were "then available" to the movant, they are
permanently lost. Not only is defendant prevented from
making it the subject of a second preliminary motion but he
or she may not even assert the defense in his or her answer.
 
Rearden, 101 Hawai 'i at 247, 65 P.3d at 1039 (brackets and 
emphasis omitted) (quoting 5A Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & 
Procedure: Civil § 1391, at 744 (2d ed. 1990).7 
On January 27, 2014, Bernardino filed her Motion to
 
Dismiss the Complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction
 pursuant to HRCP Rule 12(b)(1), which the circuit court
 considered and then denied on June 10, 2014. Bernardino's Motion
 to Dismiss did not include her HRCP Rule 12(b)(5) insufficient
 service of process defense.
 
Therefore, under HRCP Rule 12(h)(1)(A), Bernardino 
waived her challenge to the sufficiency of service of process.
8 
See Rearden, 101 Hawai 'i at 248, 65 P.3d at 1040 (holding that, 
pursuant to HRCP Rule 12(h)(1)(A), defendant waived his HRCP Rule 12(b)(2) lack of personal jurisdiction defense where he omitted the defense from his pre-answer motion to dismiss based on HRCP 
7
 HRCP Rules 12(b), (g), and (h) are substantively similar to FRCP
Rules 12(b), (g), and (h). "Where we have patterned a rule of procedure after
an equivalent rule within the FRCP, interpretations of the rule by the federalcourts are deemed to be highly persuasive in the reasoning of this court."Rearden, 101 Hawai' i at 247, 65 P.3d at 1039 (quoting Gold v. Harrison, 88 
Hawai'i 94, 105, 962 P.2d 353, 364 (1998)). 
8
 Because we hold that Bernardino waived her HRCP Rule 12(b)(5)
insufficient service of process defense by failing to include it in her
January 27, 2014 Motion to Dismiss, we need not determine if Bernardino also
waived her defense at an earlier point in the lower court proceedings. 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Rule 12(b)(5) insufficiency of service and HRCP Rule 12(b)(6) 
failure to state a claim defenses); Roxas v. Marcos, 89 Hawai 'i 
91, 135, 969 P.2d 1209, 1253 (1998) ("[N]otwithstanding that the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction was asserted in the [defendant-appellant's] answer to the plaintiffs-appellees' complaint, . . . the [defendant-appellant's] failure to assert [their personal jurisdiction defense] in their motion to dismiss constitutes a waiver of the issue pursuant to HRCP Rule 12(g) and (h)."); see also 5B Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 3d § 1353, at 340 (2004) ("[I]f a motion is made asserting any of the defenses listed in Rule 12(b), any objection to process must be joined in that motion or it will be deemed waived."). 
Second, Bernardino argues that the FOF/COL and Judgment
 
are void because "[U.S. Bank] and its counsel submitted documents
 to the [circuit] court with false statements to obtain the
 Judgment of Foreclosure." Specifically, Bernardino argues that
 the circuit court erred in granting U.S. Bank's MSJ because U.S.
 Bank did not provide "written documentation" proving that
 Argent's agent who signed the AOM, Michael Powell (Powell), had
 
the authority to assign the Mortgage.
 
Typically, mortgagors lack standing to challenge the 
validity of the assignment of their mortgages where they are not 
parties to the agreement, unless the "challenge would deem the assignment void, not voidable." U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n v. 
Salvacion, 134 Hawai
'i 170, 175, 338 P.3d 1185, 1190 (App. 
2014)). Courts have previously held that a successful challenge to a person or entity's authority to assign loan documents only renders the assignment voidable. See Paik-Apau v. Deutsche Bank 
Nat'l Tr. Co., 2012 WL 5207495, at *5 (D. Haw. Oct. 19, 2012) (contrasting void and voidable contracts, while holding that "[mortgagor's] challenges to the assignments of her loan go to whether those assignments are voidable, as she argues that persons or entities lacked authority to assign the loan documents"); see also Salvacion, 134 Hawai
'i at 175-76, 338 P.3d 
at 1190-91. Because Bernardino was not a party to the AOM and 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
because her arguments challenging Powell's authority would only
 
render the AOM voidable, she does not have standing to challenge
 the AOM and her argument is without merit. 
The FOF/COL and Judgment are, therefore, not void and
 
the circuit court did not err in determining that Bernardino was
 not entitled to HRCP Rule 60(b)(4) relief.
B. HRCP Rule 59(e) 
Bernardino also argues that she was entitled to relief
 
pursuant to HRCP Rule 59(e). Bernardino contends that she was
 
entitled to HRCP Rule 59(e) relief and reconsideration of the
 circuit court's Order Confirming Sale/Writ of Ejectment because
 she did not receive service of U.S. Bank's Complaint and summons.
 In her opening brief, Bernardino cites to her HRCP Rule 60(b)(4)
 insufficient service of process argument to support her claim
 that she was entitled to relief under HRCP Rule 59(e) as well.
 Because we hold that Bernardino waived her insufficient service
 of process defense, we need not address her argument within the
 context of HRCP Rule 59(e). 
Bernardino also contends that she was entitled to HRCP 
Rule 59(e) relief because U.S. Bank's Complaint did not request the circuit court to issue a writ of ejectment. The purpose of a motion for reconsideration made pursuant to HRCP Rule 59(e) "is to allow the parties to present new evidence and/or arguments that could not have been presented during the earlier adjudicated motion." Amfac, Inc. v. Waikiki Beachcomber Inv. Co., 74 Haw. 
85, 114, 839 P.2d 10, 27 (1992). "Reconsideration is not a device to relitigate old matters or to raise arguments or evidence that could and should have been brought during the earlier proceeding." Sousaris v. Miller, 92 Hawai
'i 505, 513, 
993 P.2d 539, 547 (2000). Bernardino's argument challenging the appropriateness of a writ of ejectment could have and should have been raised in an opposition to U.S. Bank's motion seeking entry of a writ of ejectment. Bernardino failed to oppose U.S. Bank's motion and, therefore, cannot now utilize HRCP Rule 59(e) to raise legal arguments that should have been raised before the 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
circuit court granted U.S. Bank's request for a writ of
 
ejectment. See Amfac, Inc., 74 Haw. at 114-15, 839 P.2d at 27.
