Upon consideration of the Stipulation for Dismissal of
 
Appeal, filed April 9, 2015, by Defendants-Appellants John L.
 
Laudon and Wendy W. Laudon, the papers in support, and the
 record, it appears that (1) the stipulation is dated and signed
 by counsel for all parties; (2) the parties seek to dismiss the
 appeal pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 
Rule 42(b), which governs dismissal of docketed appeals; (3) the
 appeal has not been docketed, so dismissal is authorized by HRAP
 Rule 42(a); and (4) the parties agree to bear their own
 attorney's fees and costs on appeal.
