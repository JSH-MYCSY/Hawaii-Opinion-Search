IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI #I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
KATHERINE MUZIK, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
(CASE NO. 5DTA-14-00161)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Fujise, Acting Chief Judge, Ginoza and Chan, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Katherine Margaret Muzik (Muzik)
appeals from the "Findings of Fact; Conclusions of Law; Order
Granting Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Based on Rule 48, Speedy
Trial Without Prejudice" (Order Dismissing Charges Without
Prejudice).  Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai #i charged Muzik by
amended complaint with operating a vehicle under the influence of
an intoxicant (OVUII) (Count 1); and reckless driving (Count 2).  
The District Court of the Fifth Circuit (District Court)1
dismissed the amended complaint without prejudice pursuant to
Hawai#i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 48.  The District
Court filed its Order Dismissing Charges Without Prejudice on
February 19, 2015.  
On appeal, Muzik contends that:  (1) the delay in
bringing her case to trial violated her right to a speedy trial
under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and
required the dismissal of the charges with prejudice; and (2) the
District Court abused its discretion under HRPP Rule 48 in

dismissing the charges without prejudice, instead of with
prejudice.  As explained below, we conclude that the pretrial
delay did not violate Muzik's constitutional right to a speedy
trial.  We further conclude that the District Court's failure to
address the Estencion factors2 in dismissing the charges without
prejudice under HRPP Rule 48 requires that we remand the case for
further proceedings.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve Muzik's points of error as follows:
1. Muzik's contention that the delay in bringing her
case to trial violated her constitutional right to a speedy trial
is without merit.  In analyzing whether a defendant's
constitutional right to a speedy trial has been violated, we
apply the four-part test articulated in Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S.
514 (1972).  State v. Visintin , No. CAAP-14-0000391, 2018 WL
950112, at *13 (Hawai #i App. Feb. 20, 2018).  "The four Barker
factors are: (1) length of delay; (2) the reasons for the delay;
(3) the defendant's assertion of his or her right to speedy
trial; and (4) prejudice to the defendant."  Id. (internal
quotation marks and citation omitted).
The length of the twelve-month delay between Muzik's
arrest and original posting of bail and her motion to dismiss was
sufficient to trigger inquiry into the other Barker factors, and
the second factor weighs in favors of Muzik.  See State v. Lau ,
78 Hawai #i 54, 62-63, 890 P.2d 291, 299-300 (1995).  However,
these two factors are outweighed by Muzik's failure to assert her
right to a speedy trial prior to her motion to dismiss and her
failure to demonstrate any actual prejudice from the delay in
bringing her case to trial.  See id.  at 62-66, 890 P.2d at 299-
303 (holding that the delay of up to twenty-four months between
the date of arrest and the filing of the motion to dismiss did
2The "Estencion factors" are:  "'[(1)] the seriousness of the
offense; [(2)] the facts and the circumstances of the case which led to the
dismissal; and [(3)] the impact of a reprosecution on the administration of
[HRPP Rule 48] and on the administration of justice."  State v. Hern , 133
Hawai#i 59, 60, 323 P.3d 1241, 1242 (App. 2013) (brackets in original)
(quoting State v. Estencion , 63 Haw. 264, 269, 625 P.2d 1040, 1044 (1981)).

not violate the defendant's constitutional right to a speedy
trial).  
In this regard, we note that Muzik did not demonstrate
that the delay in bringing her case to trial impaired her
defense.  See id. at 65, 890 P.2d at 302 (concluding that
limiting the impairment of a defendant's defense is the most
serious interest protected by the constitutional right to a
speedy trial).  Muzik's only claim of prejudice was that her
license was administratively suspended upon her arrest for OVUII
and that she faced possible new actions against her license based
on the late-filed complaint.  However, the timing of the filing
of the complaint against Muzik does not expose her to any greater
penalty regarding the revocation of her license, and she is in
the same position as other individuals who are prosecuted for
OVUII after their licenses have been administratively revoked.  
See HRS ยง 291E-32 (2007) ("When a person's license and privilege
to operate a vehicle is [administratively] revoked under this
part and the person also is convicted of an offense under section
291E-61 . . . arising out of the same occurrence, the total
period of revocation imposed in the two proceedings shall not
exceed the longer period of revocation imposed in either
proceeding.").  
Accordingly, we conclude that Muzik's constitutional
right to a speedy trial was not violated.
2.  In State v. Hern, 133 Hawai #i 59, 64, 323 P.3d
1241, 1246 (App. 2013), this court held that "in determining
whether to dismiss a charge with or without prejudice under HRPP
Rule 48(b), the trial court must not only consider the Estencion
factors, but must also clearly articulate the effect of the
Estencion  factors and any other factor it considered in rendering
its decision."  Here, the District Court did not provide any
explanation for its decision to dismiss the charges under HRPP
Rule 48(b) without prejudice rather than with prejudice.  
Contrary to Muzik's suggestion, the OVUII and reckless
driving charges against her cannot be categorically classified as
non-serious offenses, and the District Court should conduct a
particularized inquiry in determining the seriousness of these
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
offenses.  State v. Fukuoka, 141 Hawai# i 48, 56-59, 404 P.3d 314,
322-25 (2017).  In addition, prejudice caused to a defendant by a
trial delay is a relevant, although not a mandatory, factor for a
trial court to consider in determining the impact of
reprosecution on the administration of HRPP Rule 48 and on the
administration of justice.  Id.  at 63-64, 404 P.3d at 329-30.     
We conclude that the record in this case is inadequate
to permit meaningful review of the District Court's exercise of
discretion in dismissing the charges without prejudice.  See
Hern, 133 Hawai #i at 64-65, 323 P.3d at 1246-47.  Accordingly, we
vacate the District Court's Order Dismissing Charges Without
Prejudice, and we remand the case with instructions that the
District Court:  (1) consider the Estencion  factors in
determining whether to dismiss the charges against Muzik with or
without prejudice; and (2) make findings that clearly articulate
the effect of the Estencion  factors and any other factor it
considered in rendering its decision.
Based on the foregoing, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the
District Court of the Fifth Circuit's Order Dismissing Charges
Without Prejudice is vacated, and the case is remanded for
further proceedings consistent with this Summary Disposition
Order.
