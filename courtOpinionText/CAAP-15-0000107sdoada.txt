 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Foreclosure Filed April 15, 2014 (Summary Judgment Order), which
 
were both entered by the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit
 
(Circuit Court).1
 
On appeal, Appellants primarily contend that Plaintiff/
 
Counterclaim Defendant-Appellee Nationstar Mortgage LLC
 (Nationstar) lacked standing to foreclosure on the subject
 
mortgage and, therefore, that the Circuit Court erred in entering
 
the Summary Judgment Order. 
Through (1) certified copies of the mortgage and
 
relevant assignments, as well as the other exhibits submitted in
 support of summary judgment and (2) the Verification of Complaint
 for Foreclosure by Vi Tran, Assistant Secretary for Nationstar,
 which submitted and attested to the subject note, mortgage,
 assignment of mortgage, record of default, and notice of default,
 which was executed by Vi Tran under the penalty of perjury, and
 which was specifically referenced and relied on in support of
 summary judgment, Nationstar established, inter alia: (1) the
 existence and execution by Ruth C. Alejandro, Joy D. Pasalo,
 Rommel Antonio P. Agtagma, Lorna D. Agtagma of the subject note
 
2
and mortgage;  (2) the terms of the note and mortgage; (3)
default on the payments due under the terms of the note and

 
mortgage; and (4) notice of default. See Bank of Honolulu, N.A.

 
v. Anderson, 3 Haw. App. 545, 551, 654 P.2d 1370, 1375 (1982). 
In addition, the sworn Verification of Complaint for Foreclosure

 The Honorable Joseph E. Cardoza presided.

 After the execution of the note and mortgage, the subject property
was deeded to all Appellants, subject to Nationstar's mortgage.

established that Nationstar had possession of the original
 
promissory note, endorsed in blank, at the commencement of the
 foreclosure proceedings in this case. See Bank of America, N.A.
 
v. Reyes-Toledo, __ Hawai
'i __, __ P.3d __, No. SCWC-15-0000005, 
slip op. (Feb. 28, 2017). Therefore, there is no genuine issue of material fact that Nationstar established its entitlement and standing to foreclose in this case. 
Appellants' other assertions, related to loan 
securitization and assignment, are also without merit. See, 
e.g., U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n. v. Salvacion, 134 Hawai
'i 170, 175­
76, 338 P.3d 1185, 1190-91 (App. 2014); Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Pasion, No. CAAP–12–0000657, 2015 WL 4067259, at *3 (Haw. App. June 30, 2015) (SDO), cert. denied, 2015 WL 5965835 (Haw. Oct. 13, 2015). U.S. Bank Nat. Ass'n v. Benoist 2015 WL 7260350 (SDO 
Nov. 12, 2015). 
Accordingly, the Circuit Court's January 28, 2015 
Judgment is affirmed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, March 23, 2017.
