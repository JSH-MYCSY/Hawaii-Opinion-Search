1  The Honorable Joseph E. Cardoza presided.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
On appeal, Tucker contends that the circuit court erred
by denying her procedural and substantive due process rights
under the Hawai #i State Constitution and the United States
Constitution by depriving her of property without an evidentiary
hearing to determine the fair market value of her property at the
time of the confirmation sale.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Tucker's
points of error as follows and affirm as set forth below.
This dispute arises from a judicial foreclosure action
in which Tucker appeals from the 1/29/15 Deficiency Judgment. 
On November 12, 2014, after the circuit court had
entered a foreclosure judgment in its favor, LCP-Maui filed its
Motion for Determination of Deficiency Amount (Deficiency
Motion).  On December 3, 2014, Tucker filed her opposition to the
Deficiency Motion arguing that LCP-Maui's Deficiency Motion was
in violation of due process of law and that an evidentiary
hearing should be held to determine fair market value of the
subject properties at the time of the sale confirmation.  The
circuit court subsequently entered the 1/29/15 Order Granting
Deficiency Amount and the 1/29/15 Deficiency Judgment in favor of
LCP-Maui and against Tucker in the amount of $1,293,835.69.
Tucker asserts in this appeal that the process in
Hawai#i for determining deficiency judgments violates her
procedural due process rights.  Tucker argues that in calculating
the deficiency judgment, an evidentiary hearing should have been
held to determine the fair market value of the foreclosed
properties and such fair market value should have then been used
to calculate the applicable deficiency.
In response, LCP-Maui argues that this appeal should be
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because Tucker was required to
raise her due process issues in a prior appeal.  Specifically,
Tucker previously appealed and challenged the circuit court's
"Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Granting LCP-
Maui, LLC's Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment and For Decree of
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Foreclosure" filed on January 29, 2014 ( 1/29/14 FOF/COL/Order ),
and the related Judgment filed on March 20, 2014 ( 3/20/14
Foreclosure Judgment ), which resulted in appellate case CAAP-14-
0000513 ( First Appeal).  LCP-Maui, LLC v. Tucker , No. CAAP-14-
0000513, 2016 WL 3615281 (Hawai #i App. Jun. 30, 2016).  In the
First Appeal, Tucker raised various issues challenging the
foreclosure decree and judgment in favor of LCP-Maui, but did not
raise any point of error relating to Tucker's liability for a
deficiency judgment or how a deficiency judgment would be
calculated.  Id.  at *1.
However, the 1/29/14 FOF/COL/Order addressed the method
by which the deficiency judgment would be determined,
specifically in conclusions of law ( COL) No. 4, which provided:
LCP-Maui is entitled to a deficiency judgment under the
Notes and Mortgages for the difference between the amount
owed to LCP-Maui under the Notes and Mortgages, and the
foreclosure sale proceeds applied thereto; provided,
however, that a deficiency judgment shall not be entered
against Defendant Tucker unless and until authorized by the
Bankruptcy Court or otherwise permitted under bankruptcy
law.
(Emphasis added.)  Moreover, the related 3/20/14 Foreclosure
Judgment specified that "[t]he provisions of the [1/29/14
FOF/COL/Order], which include a decree of foreclosure, an order
of sale, and an adjudication as to the entitlement to a
deficiency judgment among other things, are incorporated herein." 
(Emphasis added.)
As LCP-Maui argues, some case law suggests that in this
circumstance, the appeal should be dismissed for lack of
appellate jurisdiction.  See Security Pacific Mortg. Corp. v.
Miller, 71 Haw. 65, 783 P.2d 855 (1989); Citicorp Mortg., Inc. v.
Bartolome, 94 Hawai# i 422, 16 P.3d 827 (App. 2000).  More
recently, however, in Mortg. Elec. Registration Sys., Inc. v.
Wise, 130 Hawai #i 11, 304 P.3d 1192 (2013), the Hawai# i Supreme
Court exercised appellate jurisdiction but held in a judicial
foreclosure action that challenges to a foreclosure judgment were
barred by res judicata where the defendants failed to appeal from
the initial foreclosure judgment.
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
In this case, similar to Wise, we exercise appellate
jurisdiction but hold that Tucker is precluded from challenging
the method of calculating her deficiency judgment.  LCP-Maui's
right to a deficiency judgment and the method for calculating the
deficiency judgment were adjudicated and set forth in the 1/29/14
FOF/COL/Order, and incorporated into the related 3/20/14
Judgment.  In the instant appeal, although Tucker timely appealed
from the subsequent 1/29/15 Deficiency Judgment, she is only
entitled to challenge the errors unique to that 1/29/15
Deficiency Judgment.  See Id.  at 16, 304 P.3d at 1197; see also
Ke Kailani Partners, LLC v. Ke Kailani Dev. LLC, Nos.
CAAP–12–0000758 and CAAP–12–0000070, 2016 WL 2941054, at *7 (Haw.
App. Apr. 29, 2016) (Mem. Op.), cert. denied , 2016 WL 4651424, at
*1 (Haw. Sept. 6, 2016) (holding, inter alia , that appellants had
waived their challenge to the method used to determine a
deficiency judgment by dismissing a prior appeal from a
foreclosure order that had set forth the entitlement to a
deficiency judgment and the method for determining the amount).
In sum, the 1/29/15 Deficiency Judgment in this case
did not adjudicate the method by which the deficiency would be
calculated, but rather was incident to the enforcement of the
earlier 3/20/14 Foreclosure Judgment.  See Wise , 130 Hawai# i at
16, 304 P.3d at 1197.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment,
entered on January 29, 2015, in the Circuit Court of the Second
Circuit is affirmed.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, February 28, 2018.
