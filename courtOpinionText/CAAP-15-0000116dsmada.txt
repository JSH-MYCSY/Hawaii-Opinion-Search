APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 11-1-0694-04)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL PURSUANT TO HRAP Rule 11(c)(2)
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that:
 
(1) On March 3, 2015, the appellate clerk
 
electronically filed pro se Plaintiff-Appellant Francis
 Grandinetti's (Appellant) notice of appeal;
 
(2) Appellant did not pay the filing fee with the 
notice of appeal, or request a fee waiver by filing a motion for leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis. See Hawai
'i Rules 
of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rules 3(a) & 24; 
(3) On April 14, 2015, the appellate clerk notified
 
Appellant that he must pay the filing fee or file a motion for
 leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis by April 24, 2015,
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
or the matter would be called to the court's attention for
 
appropriate action, which may include dismissal of the appeal;
 
(4) On April 16, 2015, the circuit court clerk filed
 
the record on appeal prematurely, before Appellant paid the
 filing fee or obtained an order allowing him to proceed in forma
 pauperis;
 
(5) The record on appeal does not indicate the circuit
 
court in the underlying case, Civil No. 11-1-0694, permitted
 Appellant to proceed in forma pauperis. See HRAP Rule 24(b);
 
(6) On May 5, 2015, the court extended to May 26, 2015,
 
the time for Appellant to pay the appellate filing fee or file a
 motion for leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis. The
 court cautioned Appellant that failure to comply with the order
 may result in the appeal being dismissed;
 
(7) On May 21 and 22, 2015, Appellant filed various
 
documents with the court, none of which may be fairly construed
 to seek, or contain enough information to grant, leave to proceed
 on appeal in forma pauperis; and
 
(8) Appellant has not otherwise paid the appellate
 
filing fee, or filed a motion for leave to proceed on appeal in
 forma pauperis.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is
 
dismissed, pursuant to HRAP Rule 11(c)(2).
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that any relief requested in the
 
documents filed May 21 and 22, 2015, at dockets 21 and 23
 respectively, is dismissed as moot.
