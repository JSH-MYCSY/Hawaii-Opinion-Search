I. BACKGROUND
 
On March 10, 2000, Lee purchased a condominium property
 
(Unit 108). Lee owed monthly maintenance fees to the
 
condominium's AOAO and in 2012 had fallen behind on the
 
maintenance fee payments to the AOAO. The AOAO filed a lien
 against Unit 108 in September 2013 for unpaid amounts assessed by
 the AOAO totaling $30,584.55.
 
Lee conveyed Unit 108 to Nomura and himself as tenants
 
by the entirety through a quitclaim deed dated January 17, 2014
 and recorded in the Bureau of Conveyances. In addition to

and conclusions;
 
(D) when the point involves a ruling upon the report
of a master, a quotation of the objection to the report.
 
Points not presented in accordance with this section
will be disregarded, except that the appellate court, at its

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Appellants, Aloha Rainbow Investments, Inc., a Hawai 'i 
corporation, held a 5% interest in Unit 108.
 On February 18, 2014, the AOAO filed a "Notice of 
Default and Intention to Foreclose," recorded in the Bureau of 
Conveyances on February 19, 2014. The AOAO held a public auction on August 19, 2014 and purchased Unit 108 for one dollar. The AOAO recorded its "Quitclaim Assignment of Lease" on September 2, 2014. 
On October 24, 2014, the AOAO filed a complaint for 
eviction in the district court. On January 2, 2015, the AOAO filed a motion for summary judgment (MSJ). 
Appellants filed a motion to dismiss on January 21, 
2015 (Motion to Dismiss), arguing the district court lacked 
subject matter jurisdiction "because this case is an action in 
which the title to real property is in dispute . . . ." On the same day, Appellants filed their opposition to the AOAO's MSJ, incorporating their arguments from their Motion to Dismiss on the district court's subject matter jurisdiction. 
The AOAO filed their reply in support of their MSJ 
(Reply) on January 22, 2015. 
On January 26, 2015, the district court held a hearing 
on Appellants' Motion to Dismiss and the AOAO's MSJ. At the hearing, the district court gave an oral ruling denying Appellants' Motion to Dismiss and granting the AOAO's MSJ. The district court entered its orders on February 2, 2015. 
On February 3, 2015, the district court entered a 
judgment for possession and writ of possession. On February 4, 2015, Appellants filed "[Appellants'] Emergency Ex Parte Motion 
for Temporary Stay of Enforcement of the Court's Writ of 
Ejectment Pending Disposition of [Appellants'] Motion to Set Supersedeas Bond for a Stay Pending Appeal". Appellants filed a corrected version on February 5, 2015 (Motion for Stay Pending
Appeal). 
Appellants filed their notice of appeal on March 4, 
2015. 
The district court denied Appellants' Motion for Stay 
Pending Appeal on March 31, 2015.

II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
Subject Matter Jurisdiction
 
"The existence of subject matter jurisdiction is a
 
question of law that is reviewable de novo under the right/wrong
 
standard."   U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n v. Castro, 131 Hawai 'i 28, 34, 
313 P.3d 717, 723 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted)
 
(quoting Aames Funding Corp. v. Mores, 107 Hawai 'i 95, 98, 110 
P.3d 1042, 1045 (2005)). 
III.
 DISCUSSION
 
Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction
 
Appellants argue that the district court erred by
 
denying their Motion to Dismiss because Appellants met their
 burden under District Court Rules of Civil Procedure (DCRCP) Rule
 
12.1, which provides:
 
Rule 12.1. DEFENSE OF TITLE IN DISTRICT COURTS.
 
Pleadings. Whenever, in the district court, in

defense of an action in the nature of an action of trespass
or for the summary possession of land, or any other action,
the defendant shall seek to interpose a defense to the
jurisdiction to the effect that the action is a real action,
or one in which the title to real estate is involved, such
defense shall be asserted by a written answer or written
motion, which shall not be received by the court unless
accompanied by an affidavit of the defendant, setting forth
the source, nature and extent of the title claimed by
defendant to the land in question, and such further
particulars as shall fully apprise the court of the nature
of defendant's claim.
 
Appellants argue that because they met their burden under DCRCP
 
Rule 12.1, the district court lacked jurisdiction over the
 
3
ejectment proceeding under HRS ยง 604-5(d) (1993),  and therefore
should have granted Appellants' Motion to Dismiss.
 
DCRCP Rule 12.1 was adopted to prevent abuse of HRS
 
ยง 604-5(d) by requiring a defendant challenging the district
 
3 HRS ยง 604-5(d) provides:
 
ยง604-5 Civil jurisdiction.
 
. . . .
 
(d) The district courts shall not have cognizance of
real actions, nor actions in which the title to real estate
comes in question, nor actions for libel, slander,
defamation of character, malicious prosecution, false
imprisonment, breach of promise of marriage, or seduction;
nor shall they have power to appoint referees in any cause.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
court's jurisdiction to file an affidavit describing the 
defendant's claim to title with specificity. Deutsche Bank Nat'l 
Tr. Co. v. Peelua, 126 Hawai 'i 32, 36, 265 P.3d 1128, 1132 
(2011). In Peelua, the Hawai 'i Supreme Court explained: 
[T]he source, nature, and extent of title claimed by the
defendant, must be described to the court with some detail
and specificity. In addition to particularly describing the
source, nature, and extent of title, the defendant may also
include in the affidavit any other particulars, the
objective being to apprise the court fully of the nature of
the defendant's claim. This, in turn, would obviate the
risk of dishonest and reckless pleas[.]
 
Id. at 37, 265 P.3d at 1133.
 
In support of their Motion to Dismiss, Appellants
 
attached a joint declaration stating:
 
3. In 2000, [Lee] purchased Unit 108 and [Lee's]
interest was later conveyed with a 95% interest to
[Appellants] with 5% to Aloha Rainbow Investments, Inc., a
Hawaii corporation by Quitclaim Deed recorded in the Office
of the Assistant Registrar, Land Court on January 17, 2014
as Doc. No. T8782263 on Certificate No. 1053288, 182404, a
true and correct copy of which is attached as Exhibit "A"
hereto (the "Defendants' Quitclaim").
 
4. After the purchase of Unit 108, [Lee] experienced
continuous harassment by the [AOAO] regarding [his] use of
units 108 and 4000. In particular, the AOAO prevented me
from advertising unit 108, which resulted in a loss of
clients, business, and tenants.
 
. . . .
 
6. Over the next four years, the maintenance fees
continued to increase as a result of improper management by
the AOAO. Indeed, from 2003 through 2011 the maintenance
fees for units 4000 and 108 increased from $5,500 per year
to $13,500 per year. . . . .
 
. . . .
 
10. . . . [T]he fee situation created uncertainty for
the owners, contributed to decreased unit sale prices, and
fostered delinquencies in maintenance fees and mortgage
payments. In 2012, as a consequence of the increased
maintenance fees due to poor management and [an] erroneous
special assessment, [Appellants] fell behind on payment of
their maintenance fee.
 
11. A lien was filed by the AOAO against Unit 108 in
September 2013. A copy of the Notice of Lien dated
September 9, 2013 and recorded September 11, 2013 as Doc.
No. 8654402, affecting Certificate of Title Nos. 1053288 and
182404 is attached as Exhibit "B" hereto.
 
12. Subsequently the AOAO filed a Notice of Default
and Intention to Foreclose & Exhibits "A"-"C" dated February
18, 2014 and recorded on February 19, 2014 as Doc. No.
8815270, affecting Certificate of Title Nos. 1053288 and
182404 (the "Notice of Intent to Foreclose"), attached as
Exhibit "C" hereto.
 
6
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
13. Such Notice of Intent to Foreclose was for a nonยญ
judicial foreclosure that the AOAO was attempting based on a
power of sale purportedly contained in the Second Restated
Declaration of Condominium Property Regime of Century Center
executed January 31, 2014 (the "Declarations") attached [as]
Exhibit "D" hereto. The Declarations do not in fact contain
 a contractual power of sale and the AOAO had no power to
conduct a non-judicial sale on Unit 108. Section H, page 11
of the Declarations provides:
 
...the unpaid amount of such assessments
against any apartment shall constitute a
lien against such apartment which may be
foreclosed by the Board or Managing Agent
as provided said [sic] Condominium Property
Act.....
 
14. Such language in the Declarations does not
constitute a contractual grant of a power of sale. As a
 result the non-judicial foreclosure was invalid and the
AOAO's claim to title is in void [sic].
 
15. The non-judicial foreclosure on Unit 108 was
further effected by Affidavit of Non-Judicial Foreclosure
Under Power of Sale recorded on September 2, 2014 as Doc.
No. 9010254 on [Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT)] 1053288
(the "Affidavit"), a copy of which is attached as Exhibit
"E" hereto.
 
16. Under paragraphs 2, 3 and 5 of the Affidavit, the
AOAO purports to have foreclosed under a power of sale in
the Declarations and under Chapter 667 of the Hawaii Revised
Statutes. As noted, the purported contractual power of sale
contained in the Declarations is not sufficient to provide
authority for the AOAO to have conducted the non-judicial
foreclosure. 
17. After the AOAO allegedly held a public auction on
August 19, 2014, the AOAO purports to have acquired title
under the Quitclaim Assignment of Lease recorded on
September 2, 2014 as Doc. No. 9010255 on TCT 1053288 a copy
of which is attached hereto as Exhibit "F" (the "AOAO
Quitclam"). The AOAO Quitclaim is in direct conflict with
the Defendants' Quitclaim and we dispute title to Unit
108[.]
 
18. Now, the AOAO seeks to eject [Appellants] from
Unit 108.
 
In sum, Appellants' position was that the non-judicial
 
foreclosure under which the AOAO assumed title was void because
 the AOAO did not have a contractual power of sale right.
 
In its Reply, the AOAO stated, "[Appellants']
 
opposition [to the AOAO's MSJ] is based entirely on the faulty
 assumption that the [AOAO] does not have the power to conduct
 nonjudicial foreclosure actions. The Land Court has already
 adjudicated this specific issue and "determined that the [AOAO]
 has the contractual right to conduct nonjudicial foreclosures."
 Jennifer M. Porter (Porter), counsel for the AOAO, submitted a
 
7

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
declaration in support of the Reply. According to the
 
declaration, the Land Court gave an oral ruling granting the
 AOAO's motion for summary judgment.
4 Attached to the declaration
 
was an unsigned and unstamped version of the Land Court's "Order
 Granting Respondent [AOAO's] Motion for Summary Judgment," which
 was purportedly pending the Land Court's review and approval.
 
At the hearing on the Motion to Dismiss, the district
 
court ruled, "Based upon the representations in the reply to [the
 AOAO's MSJ], . . . it's my understanding that Land Court
 has -- took jurisdiction over that matter and has resolved it. 
Therefore, based upon that resolution, I'm going to deny the
 motion to dismiss. I find that we do have jurisdiction over this
 matter."
 
Appellants have sufficiently set forth the scope,
 
nature, and extent of their claim to title to the land in
 question. See Fed. Nat. Mortg. Ass'n v. Brown, No. CAAP-11ยญ
0000572 at *5 (App. May 19, 2014) (mem.) (holding that defendant
 provided sufficient information for a court to discern the
 source, nature, and extent of title claimed where "[t]he Mortgage
 reflects that [defendant] held title as Tenant In Severalty, and
 the Quitclaim Apartment Deed reflects that [defendant] then
 conveyed his interest in the Property to himself and his wife as
 Tenants by the Entirety"). Appellants' claim to title arises
 from the quitclaim deed recorded in January 2014 conveying a 95%
 interest in Unit 108 to Appellants as tenants by the entirety.
 
Appellants have also set forth with particularity the 
basis for their challenge to the AOAO's claim to superior title sufficient to apprise the district court as to how their allegation bears on the question of title. See Peelua, 126 
Hawai
'i at 38-39, 265 P.3d at 1134-35. Appellants' declaration 
raised the specific contention that the AOAO's September 2014 quitclaim deed is void because the AOAO did not have the contractual right to foreclose on Unit 108 when Appellants fell 
4 At the hearing on Appellants' Motion to Dismiss, Appellants noted that
they were planning to appeal the Land Court's final decision. We take
 
judicial notice of the fact that Appellants filed their notice of appeal from
the Land Court's "Order Granting [the AOAO's] Motion for Summary Judgment" in
related case no. CAAP-15-0000442 on June 2, 2015.
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
behind on their payments to the AOAO. The facts elucidated in 
the declaration are not speculative, but clearly state the grounds upon which Appellants challenge the AOAO's claim to superior title. Cf. Castro, 131 Hawai
'i at 38, 313 P.3d at 727 
(holding that assertions in a declaration challenging the validity of a non-judicial foreclosure did not establish how the assertions affected the defendant's claim to title).
5 Therefore, 
the district court was without jurisdiction under HRS ยง 604-5(d) because title to the land in question was at issue. 
In their Reply, the AOAO argued that the Land Court 
ruled on the issue of whether the AOAO had the contractual right to foreclose on Unit 108. Although the AOAO did not submit an opposition to Appellants' Motion to Dismiss, the district court treated the AOAO's Reply as an opposition. Porter's declaration was effectively a counter-affidavit, which a district court may not consider in ruling on its jurisdiction. See Monette v. 
Benjamin, 52 Haw. 246, 249, 473 P.2d 864, 866 (1970) ("If a district court should consider such counter-affidavit, it in effect would be ruling on a question of title."); see also Peelua, 126 Hawai
'i at 39, 265 P.3d at 1135. The district court 
erred in basing its denial of Appellants' Motion to Dismiss on the evidence provided by the AOAO's Reply to their MSJ. 
Because we hold that the district court did not have
 
jurisdiction over the AOAO's complaint for eviction, we need not
 address Appellants' remaining points on appeal.
IV. CONCLUSION
 
Therefore, the following all entered in the District
 
Court of the First Circuit are vacated and this case is remanded
 to the district court for proceedings consistent with this
 Memorandum Opinion:
 
5 We also note that unlike the property in Aames, in which a TCT was
deemed "conclusive and unimpeachable" evidence as to title, 
Aames, 107 Hawai' i 
at 102-03, 110 P.3d at 1049-50, this case does not involve a TCT that resolves
the issue of title. Here, the applicable TCTs are TCT Nos. 1053288 and 182404for a term commencing November 30, 1976 and terminated on September 14, 2043were entered before the Appellants' defenses were raised. The TCT therefore does not preclude Appellants from challenging title to the Unit 108. See 
Aames, 107 Hawai' i at 102-03, 110 P.3d at 1049-50.
