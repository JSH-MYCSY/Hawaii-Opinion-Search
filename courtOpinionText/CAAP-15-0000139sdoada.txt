STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
NELVIN D. MALABED, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
'EWA DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-14-01034)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
Defendant-Appellant Nelvin D. Malabed (Malabed) was
 
convicted of operating a vehicle under the influence of an
 
intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 
§ 291E-61(a)(1) (2007).1 Malabed appeals from the Judgment
 
entered by the District Court of the First Circuit (District
 
2
Court) on March 11, 2015.  We affirm.
 
1HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) provides:
 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle
under the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates or
assumes actual physical control of a vehicle:
 
(1)	 While under the influence of alcohol in an amount
 sufficient to impair the person's normal mental
faculties or ability to care for the person and guard
against casualty[.]

On appeal, Malabed argues that the OVUII charge was 
defective because: (1) it charged him in the disjunctive; and (2) 
it failed to define the term "alcohol." Malabed acknowledges that his disjunctive pleading argument was rejected by the Hawai
'i Supreme Court in State v. Codiamat, 131 Hawai 'i 220, 317 
P.3d 664 (2013), and that his argument that the charge was defective for failing to define the term "alcohol" was rejected by this court in State v. Turping, No. CAAP-13-0002957, 2015 WL 792715 (Hawai
'i App. Feb. 25, 2015), cert. denied, No. SCWC-13­
0002957 (May 20, 2015). 
I.
 
We resolve the arguments raised by Malabed on appeal as
 
follows:
 
1. Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai 'i (State) 
permissibly charged Malabed in the disjunctive. Codiamat, 131 
Hawai'i at 226-27, 317 P.3d at 670-71; State v. Vaimilli, 135 
Hawai'i 492, 499-501, 353 P.3d 1034, 1041-43 (2015). 
2. The State was not required to define the term
 
"alcohol" in its OVUII charge for the charge to be sufficient. 
Turping, 2015 WL 792715, at *2-5. The State's use of the term
 "alcohol" in its OVUII charge, without alleging the term's
 statutory definition, gave Malabed fair notice of the nature and
 cause of the accusation against him. Id. at *2.
 
II. 
The District Court's Judgment is affirmed. DATED: Honolulu, Hawai
'i, October 27, 2015.
