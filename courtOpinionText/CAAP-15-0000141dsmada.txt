ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
Upon review of Plaintiffs/Counterclaim-Defendants/
 
Appellants Bali Hai Villas, Ltd., and Steven Garner's (the
 
Appellants) appeal from the Honorable Kathleen N.A. Watanabe's
 February 13, 2015 judgment in favor of Defendant/Cross-Claim
 Defendant/Appellee James Gibson (Appellee Gibson) and against the
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Appellants and Defendant/Cross-Claim Plaintiff/Cross-Claim 
Defendant/Appellee Goodsill Anderson Quinn & Stifel, LLP (Appellee Goodsill Anderson Quinn & Stifel), purportedly certified pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP), and (2) the record, it appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction because the February 13, 2015 judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable final judgment under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2014), HRCP Rule 54(b), HRCP Rule 58, and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 
869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
Under HRS § 641-1(a), an "appeal may be taken from 
circuit court orders resolving claims against parties only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 119, 869 
P.2d at 1338 (emphasis added). "Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai
'i 245, 
254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008); Bailey v. DuVauchelle, 135 Hawai
'i 482, 489, 353 P.3d 1024, 1031 (2015). "[A]n appeal from 
any judgment will be dismissed as premature if the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. 
The February 13, 2015 judgment neither resolves all 
claims against all parties nor contains the finding necessary for certification under HRCP Rule 54(b). Although the circuit court entered a separate February 13, 2015 interlocutory order granting Appellee Gibson's motion for HRCP Rule 54(b) certification, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has explained that, based on the holding 
in Jenkins, "a party cannot appeal from a circuit court order even though the order may contain [HRCP Rule] 54(b) certification language; the order must be reduced to a judgment and the [HRCP Rule] 54(b) certification language must be contained therein." Oppenheimer v. AIG Hawaii Ins. Co., 77 Hawai
'i 88, 93, 881 P.2d 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
1234, 1239 (1994) (emphases added). The February 13, 2015
 
judgment does not contain the HRCP Rule 54(b) certification
 language, namely an express determination that "there is no just
 reason for delay" in the entry of judgment as to one or more but
 fewer than all of the claims or parties. Therefore, the February
 13, 2015 judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an
 appealable final judgment under HRS § 641-1(a), HRCP Rule 54(b),
 HRCP Rule 58, and the holding in Jenkins. Absent an appealable
 final judgment, we lack appellate jurisdiction over appellate
 court case number CAAP-15-0000141, and the Appellants' appeal is
 premature. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED AND DECREED that appellate court
 
case number CAAP-15-0000141 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
