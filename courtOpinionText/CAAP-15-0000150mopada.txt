OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
ROY RITA, Petitioner-Appellant,
v.
STATE OF HAWAI #I, Respondent-Appellee
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
(S.P.P. NO. 13-1-0001)
MEMORANDUM OPINION
(By:  Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
Petitioner-Appellant Roy Rita ( Rita) appeals from the
"Findings of Fact; Conclusions of Law; Order Denying Petitioner
Roy Rita's Supplemental Claims to his March 6, 2013 HRPP Rule 40
Petition for Post-Conviction Relief, Filed November 19, 2014"
(Order Denying Supplemental Claims) entered on February 23, 2015,
in the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit.1 
On appeal, Rita contends that the circuit court erred
when it: (1) concluded that Rita's charging document was not
defective despite failing to allege a mens rea and/or that he was
not married to the complaining witness, such that Rita claims the
original trial court lacked jurisdiction to convict him; (2)
concluded that Rita's trial and appellate counsel did not render
ineffective assistance when they failed to challenge the

sufficiency of his charge; and (3) denied Rita's Hawai #i Rules of
Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40 petition without a hearing,
pursuant to HRPP Rule 40(f).  Based on the foregoing, Rita
requests that this court vacate his conviction for lack of
jurisdiction due to the deficient indictment, or, in the
alternative, vacate the circuit court's Order Denying
Supplemental Claims and remand the matter to the circuit court
for a hearing on the issues of waiver and/or ineffective
assistance of counsel. 
For the reasons stated below, we affirm the circuit
court's Order Denying Supplemental Claims.   
I. Background
On June 17, 2002, Rita was indicted and charged with,
inter alia , one count of Continuous Sexual Assault of a Minor
Under the Age of Fourteen, in violation of Hawaii Revised
Statutes ( HRS) § 707-733.5 (Supp. 2002) ( Count I).2  The charge
2  When Rita was charged in 2002, HRS § 707-733.5 (Supp. 2002) provided:
[§707-733.5]  Continuous sexual assault of a minor
under the age of fourteen years.   (1) Any person who:
(a) Either resides in the same home with a minor
under the age of fourteen years or has recurring
access to the minor; and
(b) Engages in three or more acts of sexual
penetration or sexual contact with the minor
over a period of time, but while the minor is
under the age of fourteen years,
is guilty of the offense of continuous sexual assault of a
minor under the age of fourteen years.
(2) To convict under this section, the trier of fact,
if a jury, need unanimously agree only that the requisite
number of acts have occurred; the jury need not agree on
which acts constitute the requisite number.
(3) No other felony sex offense involving the same
victim may be charged in the same proceeding with a charge
under this section, unless the other charged offense
occurred outside the time frame of the offense charged under
this section or the other offense is charged in the
alternative.  A defendant may be charged with only one count
under this section unless more than one victim is involved,
in which case a separate count may be charged for each
victim.
(4) Continuos sexual assault of a minor under the age
of fourteen years is a class A felony.
When Rita was charged in 2002, "Sexual contact" in HRS § 707-733.5
was defined in HRS § 707-700 (1993) as "any touching of the sexual
or other intimate parts of a person not married to the actor, or
(continued...)

for Count I stated:
COUNT 1:  During the period between the 7th day of
June, 1999 through the 23rd day of October, 2001, in the
County of Kauai, State of Hawaii, ROY RITA had recurring
access to [complaining witness], a minor under the age of
fourteen (14) years, and did engage in three or more acts of
sexual penetration or sexual contact with [complaining
witness] over a period of time, but while [complaining
witness] was under the age of fourteen (14) years, thereby
committing the offense of Continuous Sexual Assault of a
Minor Under the Age of Fourteen (14) Years, in violation of
Section 707-733.5 Hawaii Revised Statutes.
On February 19, 2003, a jury found Rita guilty on Count
I.  Rita was sentenced to a twenty year term of imprisonment.  
On May 1, 2003, judgment was entered. 
On May 16, 2003, Rita, represented by counsel, filed
his notice of appeal and in his direct appeal raised the
following issues:
(1) that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of
continuos sexual assault of a minor in violation of HRS 
§ 707-733.5 because evidence of a third incident of "sexual
contact" was not adduced at trial; 
(2) that (a) the term "sexual contact" as defined by HRS
§ 707-700 (1993) is unconstitutionally vague, insofar as (b)
"buttocks" are not "intimate parts," and that (c) the
circuit court erred in instructing the jury that "sexual
contact" is defined only as "any touching of the sexual or
other intimate parts of a person not married to the actor"; 
(3) that the circuit court erred in failing to instruct the
jury as to the elements of sexual assault in the fourth
degree, HRS § 707-733(1)(a) (1993), inasmuch as it is a
lesser included offense of sexual assault in the third
degree, HRS § 707-732(1)(b) (1993); 
(4) that Rita's trial counsel rendered constitutionally
ineffective assistance; and 
(5) that Rita's conviction runs afoul of this court's
decision in State v. Rabago, 103 Hawai #i 236, 81 P.3d 1151
(2003), on the bases (a) that Rabago allegedly struck down
HRS § 707-733.5 as unconstitutional in its entirety and (b)
that the circuit court erred in failing to give the jury a
mandatory "specific unanimity instruction," the prosecution,
according to Rita, having adduced evidence of more than
three acts of sexual assault at trial.
(...continued)
of the sexual or other intimate parts of the actor by the person,
whether directly or through the clothing or other material
intended to cover the sexual or other intimate parts."
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
On April 29, 2004, the Supreme Court of Hawai #i issued
a Summary Disposition Order affirming Rita's conviction and
holding, inter alia , that: (1) there was sufficient evidence to
convict Rita; (2) the term "sexual contact" as defined in HRS 
§ 707-700 (1993) was not unconstitutionally vague and the jury
instruction defining "sexual contact" was not prejudicially
insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent or misleading; (3) Sexual
Assault in the Fourth Degree in violation of HRS § 707-733(1)(a)
(1993) is not a lesser included offense of Sexual Assault in the
Third Degree in violation of HRS § 707-732(1)(b) (1993); (4) Rita
had not shown that his trial counsel provided ineffective
assistance; and (5) Rita's conviction did not run afoul of State
v. Rabago, 103 Hawai #i 236, 81 P3.d 1151 (2003).  State v. Rita,
No. 25836, 2004 WL 909731 (Haw. Apr. 29, 2004) (SDO). 
On September 27, 2004, Rita filed his first HRPP Rule
40 petition (First Petition), pro se, in which he argued that his
conviction should be vacated because his trial and appellate
counsel were ineffective.3
On December 10, 2004, the circuit court denied Rita's
First Petition without a hearing pursuant to HRPP Rule 40(f).  
On July 27, 2006, this court affirmed the circuit
court's denial of the First Petition, holding that (1) Rita's
claims that his trial counsel was ineffective were "previously
ruled upon or were waived" pursuant to HRPP Rule 40(a)(3);4 and
3  In his First Petition, Rita asserted that his trial counsel was
ineffective for failing to investigate the complaining witness's inconsistent
trial testimony.  Rita also asserted that his appellate counsel was
ineffective for failing to, inter alia , investigate complaining witness's
testimony, contact Rita prior to the preparation of the opening brief for
information, address constitutional issues, and introduce new exculpatory
evidence. 
4  HRPP Rule 40(a)(3) provides:
(a) .  The post-conviction proceeding
established by this rule shall encompass all common law and
statutory procedures for the same purpose, including habeas
corpus and coram nobis; provided that the foregoing shall
not be construed to limit the availability of remedies in
the trial court or on direct appeal.  Said proceeding shall
be applicable to judgments of conviction and to custody
based on judgments of conviction, as follows:Proceedings and Grounds

(2) Rita has failed to show that his appellate counsel was
ineffective. 
On March 6, 2013, Rita filed his second HRPP Rule 40
petition ( Second Petition ), pro se , and also requested assistance
of counsel.  The circuit court granted his request for counsel,
but it appears none was appointed before the circuit court denied
Rita's Second Petition without a hearing on July 10, 2013, again
pursuant to HRPP Rule 40(f). 
On August 9, 2013, Rita appealed from the denial
of his Second Petition. pro se 
On August 19, 2013, Rita was appointed counsel. 
On April 29, 2014, because his second petition was
denied before counsel had been appointed, this court issued a
Summary Disposition Order vacating the circuit court's order
denying Rita's Second Petition and remanded that case to the
circuit court. 
On August 22, 2014, Rita's newly appointed counsel
filed a "Motion for Leave to File Supplemental Claims for
Relief." 
On November 19, 2014, Rita filed his "Supplemental
Claims for Relief to Petitioner Roy Rita's HRPP Rule 40 Petition
for Post Conviction Relief, Filed March 6, 2013" ( Supplemental
Claims).  Rita's Supplemental Claims are the basis for his
contentions on appeal, that: (1) his conviction should be vacated
because the trial court was without jurisdiction due to the

(3) INAPPLICABILITY .  Rule 40 proceedings shall not be
available and relief thereunder shall not be granted where
the issues sought to be raised have been previously ruled
upon or were waived.  Except for a claim of illegal
sentence, an issue is waived if the petitioner knowingly and
understandingly failed to raise it and it could have been
raised before the trial, at the trial, on appeal, in a
habeas corpus proceeding or any other proceeding actually
conducted, or in a prior proceeding actually initiated under
this rule, and the petitioner is unable to prove the
existence of extraordinary circumstances to justify the
petitioner's failure to raise the issue.  There is a
rebuttable presumption that a failure to appeal a ruling or
to raise an issue is a knowing and understanding failure.

deficient charge for Count I, and (2) both his trial and
appellate counsel were ineffective for failing to assert this
jurisdictional issue. 
On February 23, 2015, the circuit court filed its Order
Denying Supplemental Claims without a hearing, again stating that
Rita's claims were frivolous pursuant to HRPP Rule 40(f).  The
court also concluded that Rita's collateral attack on the
sufficiency of Count I in his indictment must fail because (1)
Rita did not meet the exceptional circumstances test adopted in
Christian v. State, 131 Hawai #i 153, 163, 315 P.3d 779, 789 (App.
2013)5, and (2) the requirement that an indictment list every
element, as established in State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai #i 383,
387, 219 P.3d 1170, 1174 (2009), does not apply retroactively to
Rita's 2002 indictment.  With regards to Rita's ineffective
assistance of counsel arguments, the court concluded that Rita
"failed to establish that there were specific errors or omissions
of his trial counsel that resulted in the withdrawal of [sic]
substantial impairment of a potentially meritorious defense."  
On March 16, 2015, Rita timely filed his notice of
appeal for the instant case. 
II. Standard of Review
HRPP Rule 40(f) provides in relevant part:
(f) Hearings.   If a petition alleges facts that if
proven would entitle the petitioner to relief, the court
shall grant a hearing which may extend only to the issues
raised in the petition or answer.  However, the court may
deny a hearing if the petitioner's claim is patently
frivolous and is without trace of support either in the
record or from other evidence submitted by the petitioner. 
The court may also deny a hearing on a specific question of
fact when a full and fair evidentiary hearing upon that
5  The exceptional circumstances test in Christian  provided:
The sufficiency of an indictment or information is not open
to collateral attack after conviction unless it appears that
the circumstances are exceptional, that the questions raised
are of "large importance," that the need for the remedy
sought is apparent, and that the offense charged was one of
which the sentencing court manifestly had no jurisdiction.
131 Hawai #i at 163, 315 P.3d at 789 (quoting United States v. Prince ,
868 F.2d 1379, 1384 (5th Cir. 1989)).  Christian  has since been
overruled by Schwartz v. State , 136 Hawai #i 258, 281-82, 361 P.3d 1161,
1184-85 (2015).
6NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
question was held during the course of the proceedings which
led to the judgment or custody which is the subject of the
petition or at any later proceeding. 
"Whether the trial court erred in denying an HRPP Rule
40 petition without a hearing based on no showing of a colorable
claim is reviewed de novo ; thus, the right/wrong standard of
review is applicable."  Maddox v. State, 141 Hawai #i 196, 202,
407 P.3d 152, 158 (2017) (citing Dan v. State , 76 Hawai #i 423,
427, 879 P.2d 528, 532 (1994)) (internal quotation marks
omitted); see also State v. De Guair , 108 Hawai #i 179, 187, 118
P.3d 662, 670 (2005).
III. Discussion
A. Waiver
The State's answering brief does not argue waiver, but
the record as recounted above reflects that Rita previously
raised various issues on direct appeal and in his prior HRPP Rule
40 petitions.  Particularly given that his First Petition raised
the issue of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, as well
as ineffective assistance of trial counsel, we conclude that Rita
waived the issues raised in his Supplemental Claims that are at
issue in this appeal.  See HRPP Rule 40(a)(3).
As set forth below, even if we assume arguendo  that
Rita did not waive his Supplemental Claims, the circuit court did
not err in denying these claims without a hearing.
B. Jurisdiction
Rita's primary argument in this appeal is that because
the charge alleging Count I failed to assert a mens rea and/or
that he and the complaining witness were not married, a criminal
offense was not charged and therefore the trial court did not
have jurisdiction to convict him.  Rita thus argues that this
court must vacate his Count I conviction. 
In Schwartz v. State, the Supreme Court of Hawai# i held
that the failure to charge an element or the applicable mens rea
does not deprive a trial court of subject matter jurisdiction. 
136 Hawai #i 258, 265, 361 P.3d 1161, 1168 (2015) (stating "[t]his
7NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
court has implicitly rejected the proposition that a charging
instrument that fails to allege an element or the requisite mens
rea of an otherwise cognizable crime renders the trial court
without criminal jurisdiction").
Therefore, Rita's primary argument, that the circuit
court lacked jurisdiction with respect to the offense charged
under Count I, is incorrect in light of Schwartz notwithstanding
the charge's omissions of a mens rea and an assertion that Rita
was not married to the complaining witness.
C. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel
Rita also argues that both his trial and appellate
counsel were ineffective for not challenging the sufficiency of
the charge in Count I for failing to allege that Rita and the
complaining witness were not married and failing to allege a mens
rea. 
For claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel,
the following standard applies:
General claims of ineffectiveness are insufficient to
establish that the assistance a defendant received was
constitutionally ineffective.  Dan, 76 Hawai #i at 427, 879
P.2d at 532 (quoting Briones v. State, 74 Haw. 442, 462–63,
848 P.2d 966, 976 (1993)).  Rather, a defendant must show:
(1) specific errors or omissions of defense counsel
reflecting counsel's lack of skill, judgment, or diligence;
and that (2) those errors or omissions resulted in the
withdrawal or substantial impairment of a potentially
meritorious defense. [State v. Antone, 62 Haw. 346, 348-49,
615 P.2d 101, 104 (1980)] (internal citations omitted).
Maddox, 141 Hawai# i at 202, 407 P.3d at 158 (internal brackets
and quotation marks omitted).
For claims of ineffective assistance of appellate
counsel, a petitioner must establish "that (1) his appellate
counsel omitted an appealable issue, and (2) in light of the
entire record, the status of the law, and the space and time
limitations inherent in the appellate process, a reasonably
competent attorney would not have omitted that issue."  Garringer
v. State, 80 Hawai# i 327, 336, 909 P.2d 1142, 1151 (1996)
(quoting Domingo v. State , 76 Hawai #i 237, 242, 873 P.2d 775, 780
(1994)).  An "appealable issue" is "an error or omission by
8NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
counsel, judge, or jury resulting in the withdrawal or
substantial impairment of a potentially meritorious defense." 
Dan, 76 Hawai #i at 432-33, 879 P.2d at 537-38 (quoting Briones,
74 Haw. at 465-66, 848 P.2d at 977).
1.Muller issue
Rita argues, based on State v. Muller, No. CAAP-10-
0000225, 2014 WL 444230 at *1-2 (Hawai# i App. Jan. 31, 2014),
that his charge for Count I was defective because it did not
state that he and the complaining witness were not married to
each other, and that his trial and appellate counsel should have
raised this issue.  In Muller , a 2014 unpublished Summary
Disposition Order, this court held that a charge of Sexual
Assault in the Third Degree, in violation of HRS § 707-732(1)(b),
was deficient because it failed to allege the essential element
that the complaining witness and defendant were not married to
each other.6  As explained in Muller , although the defendant had
only challenged the sufficiency of the charge for the first time
on appeal, recent decisions by the Hawai #i Supreme Court in 2013
and 20147 required a ruling that, where a charge failed to allege
an element or a mens rea, "the charge 'cannot be reasonably
construed to state an offense' and the conviction must be
vacated."  Muller, 2014 WL 444230, at *2.  The case in Muller was
remanded for dismissal without prejudice.
We reject Rita's claim that his trial and appellate
counsel were ineffective with regard to the Muller issue.  First,
even if Rita's trial counsel had raised the issue during trial
proceedings, the prosecution would have been able to re-file
Rita's indictment and thus any alleged error did not result in
the withdrawal or substantial impairment of a potentially
meritorious defense.  Second, unlike the charge of Sexual Assault
6 Prior to the charge being filed in Muller, the Hawai #i Supreme Court
had set out the four material elements of the offense of Sexual Assault in the
Third Degree under HRS § 707–732(1)(b), one of which was “that [the defendant]
was aware that the Minor was not married to him[.]"  See State v. Arceo, 84
Hawai#i 1, 15, 928 P.2d 843, 857 (1996).
7  State v. Apollonio, 130 Hawai #i 353, 311 P.3d 676 (2013) and State v.
Akitake, No. SCWC–29934 (Haw. Jan. 10, 2014) (SDO).
9NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
in the Third Degree in Muller, there was no existing case law at
the time of Rita's trial or his direct appeal setting forth the
elements of the Count I offense of Continuous Sexual Assault of a
Minor Under the Age of Fourteen.  Third, given the "space and
time limitations inherent in the appellate process," Garringer,
80 Hawai# i at 336, 909 P.2d at 1151, and the other issues raised
during Rita's direct appeal, it does not appear Rita's appellate
counsel reasonably should have challenged the sufficiency of the
charge.  Thus, there was no specific error or omission by Rita's
trial counsel reflecting a lack of skill, judgment, or diligence;
and given the circumstances, record, and the status of the law,
we cannot say that Rita's appellate counsel should have raised on
appeal that Rita's charge failed to assert that he was not
married to the complaining witness.  In short, Rita was not
denied effective assistance of trial or appellate counsel with
regard to the Muller issue.
2. Mens rea issue
Rita argues that the Count I charge for Continuous
Sexual Assault of a Minor Under the Age of Fourteen was also
defective because it did not include a mens rea, citing, inter
alia, State v. Nesmith , 127 Hawai# i 48, 276 P.3d 617 (2012),
generally, and that his trial and appellate counsel should have
raised this issue. 
Similar with the Muller issue, Rita's trial counsel was
not ineffective for failing to challenge the lack of a mens rea
in the charge, because even if the issue had been raised, the
prosecution would have been able to re-file Rita's indictment. 
Thus, there was no withdrawal or substantial impairment of a
potentially meritorious defense.
With regard to Rita's appellate counsel, the lack of a
mens rea in the charge would not have been an appealable issue. 
Existing case law at the time of Rita's direct appeal provided:
in determining whether the accused's right to be informed o
the nature and cause of the accusation against him or her
has been violated,  we must look to all of the information
supplied to him or her by the State to the point where the
court passes upon the contention that the right has been
violated.f
10NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
State v. Israel , 78 Hawai #i 66, 70, 890 P.2d 303, 307 (1995)
(internal brackets omitted)(emphasis added).  During the trial
proceedings, the jury instructions for the charge of Continuous
Sexual Assault of a Minor Under the Age of Fourteen stated, in
relevant part:
In Count 1 of the Indictment, the Defendant is charged
with the offense of Continuous Sexual Assault of A Minor
Under the Age of Fourteen Years.
The Defendant is guilty of the offense of Continuous
Sexual Assault of a Minor Under the Age of Fourteen Years if
the prosecution proves beyond a reasonable doubt all of the
following:
These four elements are:
1.  That the Defendant did intentionally or knowingly
engage in three or more acts of sexual contact with
[complaining witness] . . .
(Emphasis added.)  Thus, the record reflects that during the
trial proceedings, the State informed Rita that an intentional or
knowing state of mind was being asserted.  Rita's appellate
counsel was not ineffective for not raising the lack of a mens
rea in the charge.
IV. Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, the circuit court properly
denied Rita's Supplemental Claims without a hearing pursuant to
HRPP Rule 40(f).  We affirm the circuit court's "Order Denying
Petitioner Roy Rita's Supplemental Claims to his March 6, 2013
HRPP Rule 40 Petition for Post-Conviction Relief, Filed November
19, 2014," which was entered on February 23, 2015, in the Circuit
