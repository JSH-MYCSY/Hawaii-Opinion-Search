Judgment in favor of Agency-Appellees-Appellees Hawai# i Labor
Relations Board, James B. Nicholson, Sesnita A. D. Moepono, and

Century Public Charter School Local School Board or the Local School Board of
the Education Laboratory Public Charter School.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
of the First Circuit (Circuit Court ).2  HSTA also challenges: 
(1) the Circuit Court's February 17, 2015 Order Affirming Hawai# i
Labor Relations Board's Decision No. 479 and Order No. 2948 in
Board Case No. CU-05-305 ( Circuit Court Order ); (2) HLRB's March
19, 2014 Decision No. 479, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law,
and Decision and Order in CU-05-305 (Decision No. 479); and (3)
HLRB's November 6, 2013 preliminary ruling in CU-05-303, i.e. ,
Order No. 2948, Order Denying [HSTA's] Motion to Dismiss
Complaint; Granting [ULS's] Motion to Stay Grievance/Arbitration
Proceedings in HSTA Grievance #OC-11-23; Denying HSTA's Request
to Schedule Hearing on Prohibited Practice Complaint; Granting in
Part and Denying in Part [ULS's] Motion for Partial Summary
Judgment on its Complaint; Denying HSTA's Motion to Stay
Proceedings's until Review by Hawaii Supreme Court of Special
Proceedings is Completed; Granting [ULS's] Motion to Strike
Untimely Answer to Prohibited Practice Complaint Filed September
23, 2013; and Denying HSTA's Request to File Proposed Findings of
Fact and Conclusions of Law with Brief Now Scheduled to be Filed
on or by October 21, 2013 ( Order No. 2948 ).
In this secondary appeal, HSTA raises five points of
error, contending that the Circuit Court erred when it:  (1)
concluded that HSTA was not an aggrieved party entitled to bring
an agency appeal pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (
HRS) ยง 91-
14 (2012); (2) affirmed Decision No. 479 and Order No. 2948,
although it determined that HSTA lacked standing to appeal and
the Circuit Court thereby lacked jurisdiction to affirm Decision
2The Honorable Rhonda A. Nishimura presided.
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
No. 479 and Order No. 2948; (3) affirmed Order No. 2948 because
HLRB deviated from its rules and prior decisions in finding
HSTA's Answer to be untimely and denying HSTA an evidentiary
hearing; (4) affirmed Decision No. 479 because the Board erred by
deciding matters that were within the jurisdiction of the
Arbitrator; and (5) affirmed Decision No. 479 because the HLRB
acted upon an unlawful procedure with respect to certain aspects
of Decision No. 479.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve HSTA's points of error as follows:
On April 28, 2011, in CU-05-305, ULS filed an HLRB-4
Prohibited Practice Complaint ( Complaint ) against HSTA with HLRB. 
The proceedings in CU-05-305 culminated in the issuance of
Decision No. 479.  In Decision No. 479, in conjunction with and
pursuant to various other findings and conclusions, some of which
are disputed by HSTA, HLRB ruled in favor of HSTA, concluding: 
"For the reasons discussed above, the Board denies the Complaint
in its entirety, and hereby dismisses the Complaint."  At the
conclusion of the proceedings on HSTA's appeal to the Circuit
Court, in the February 17, 2015 Circuit Court Order, the court
concluded:
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the HLRB's Decision No. 479 and
Order No. 2948 are AFFIRMED, as the Court finds that the
HSTA is not an aggrieved party. 
(Emphasis added).

"Whether the circuit court has jurisdiction to hear the
plaintiffs' complaint presents a question of law, reviewable de
novo.  A plaintiff without standing is not entitled to invoke a
court's jurisdiction.  Thus, the issue of standing is reviewed de
novo on appeal."  Haw. Med. Ass'n v. Haw. Med. Serv. Ass'n, Inc.,
113 Hawai# i 77, 90, 148 P.3d 1179, 1192 (2006) (citation omitted;
format altered).
HRS ยง 91-14(a) provides that "[a]ny person aggrieved by
a final decision and order in a contested case or by a
preliminary ruling of the nature that deferral of review pending
entry of a subsequent final decision would deprive appellant of
adequate relief is entitled to judicial review[.]"   In order for
HSTA to have standing to appeal the HLRB's Decision 479 and Order
No. 2948, HSTA "must be aggrieved by the agency's decision and
have been "involved in the administrative proceeding that
culminated in the unfavorable decision."  United Public Workers,
Local 646, AFSCME, AFL-CIO v. Brown, 80 Hawai #i 376, 380, 910
P.2d 147, 151 (App. 1996) (citation and internal quotation marks
omitted).  As HSTA was involved in the administrative proceeding,
we consider whether HSTA was aggrieved by the HLRB's final
decision.
An "aggrieved party" is not defined in HRS Chapter 91. 
However, the supreme court noted that an "aggrieved party" is one
"whose personal or property right has been injuriously or
adversely affected by an agency's action."  Life of the Land,
Inc. v. Land Use Comm'n, 61 Haw. 3, 7, 594 P.2d 1079, 1082 (1979)
(citation omitted).  Furthermore, a "'person aggrieved' appears
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
to be essentially synonymous with someone who has suffered
'injury in fact.'"  AlohaCare v. Ito , 126 Hawai #i 326, 342, 271
P.3d 621, 637 (2012) (quoting E & J Lounge Operating Co. v.
Liquor Comm'n of the City & Cty. of Honolulu, 118 Hawai #i 320,
345 n.35, 189 P.3d 432, 457 n.35 (2008)).  "Whether one has
suffered an 'injury in fact' is determined under a three part
test: (1) whether the person 'has suffered an actual or
threatened injury as a result of the defendant's wrongful
conduct,' (2) whether 'the injury is fairly traceable to the
defendant's actions,' and (3) whether 'a favorable decision would
likely provide relief for the person's injury.'"  E & J Lounge
Operating Co., 118 Hawai #i at 345 n.35, 189 P.3d at 457 n.35
(citation and brackets omitted). 
In United Public Workers , Brown, a member of the
bargaining unit, filed a prohibited practice complaint against
UPW.  United Pub. Workers , 80 Hawai #i at 378, 910 P.2d at 149. 
The HLRB determined that "although a breach of duty of fair
representation did occur, [Brown] suffered no detriment which can
be remedied by the [HLRB]. . . ."  Id. at 379, 910 P.2d at 150
(brackets and ellipsis in original).  On appeal, UPW argued that
it had standing to appeal the HLRB's decision because it was
aggrieved by the HLRB's determination that it breached its duty
to fairly represent Brown.  Id.  at 380, 910 P.2d at 151.  This
court held that UPW failed to demonstrate that it suffered a
concrete injury, and thus, was not an aggrieved party with
standing to appeal to the circuit court.  Id. at 381, 910 P.2d at
152.
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Here, HSTA argues that it has suffered cognizable
injuries in two ways.  First, HSTA argues that it was aggrieved
by procedural errors reflected in Order No. 2948, even though the
claims against it were denied and the Complaint was dismissed,
because it is possible that the HLRB might "misuse" its rules
again in the future.  This argument is without merit, as the
possibility of injury is insufficient to constitute a concrete
injury.  See United Pub. Workers , 80 Hawai #i at 380-81, 910 P.2d
at 151-52.  
HSTA also argues that it could have been injured by the
HLRB's erroneous factual findings if the arbitrator in the
related arbitration proceedings had given those findings
preclusive effect.  Again, this argument is without merit, as the
possibility of injury is insufficient to constitute a concrete
injury.  See id.   Moreover, it is undisputed that the arbitrator
in those related proceedings preliminarily and finally concluded
that no preclusive effect would be given to the HLRB's findings,
thus rendering this issue moot.  Thus, even if this issue was
properly before the Circuit Court, it is now moot and no longer
justiciable.  See Hamilton ex rel. Lethem v. Lethem, 119 Hawai# i
1, 5, 193 P.3d 839, 843 (2008).
Nevertheless, as argued by HSTA, once the Circuit Court
concluded that HSTA did not have standing to bring an appeal
under HRS ยง 91-14, it no longer had subject matter jurisdiction
to determine the merits of HSTA's appeal.  See, e.g., Hamilton,
119 Hawai #i at 5, 193 P.3d at 843.  Therefore, we conclude that
6NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
the Circuit Court erred in affirming the HLRB's rulings, rather
than dismissing HSTA's appeal.
For these reasons, we vacate the Circuit Court Order
and Judgment affirming of HLRB's Decision No. 479 and Order No.
2948 and remand with instructions to dismiss HSTA's appeal for
lack of jurisdiction.  See Corboy v. Louie , 128 Hawai# i 89, 91,
283 P.3d 695, 697 (2011).
