ORDER DISMISSING THE APPEAL PURSUANT TO HRAP RULE 30

Upon review of the record, it appears that: 
(1) On March 20, 2015, Defendant-Appellant Esmenia
 
Pascual Sadang (Appellant), pro se, filed a notice of appeal;
 
(2) On May 19, 2015, the circuit court clerk filed the
 
record on appeal, and the appellate clerk filed the notice of
 entering case on calendar, which set the statement of
 jurisdiction and opening brief due dates at May 29, 2015, and
 June 29, 2015, respectively. It is not clear whether the
 appellate clerk served Appellant with a copy of the notice of
 entering case on calendar;

(3) On July 2, 2015, the appellate clerk filed an
 
amended notice of entering case on calendar, which set the
 
statement of jurisdiction and opening brief due dates at July 13,
 2015, and August 11, 2015, respectively. The record indicates
 the appellate clerk mailed to Appellant a copy of the amended
 notice of entering case on calendar;
 
(4) Appellant did not file either document, or request
 
an extension of time; 
(5) On August 17, 2015, the appellate clerk notified 
Appellant that the time for filing the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief had expired and, pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure Rule 30, the matter would be called to the court’s attention on August 27, 2015, for such action as the court deems proper, which could include dismissal; and 
(6) Thereafter, Appellant did not file the statement of
 
jurisdiction or opening brief, or respond to the notice of
 default. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, November 30, 2015.
