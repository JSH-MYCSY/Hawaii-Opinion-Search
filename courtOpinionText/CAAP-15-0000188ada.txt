IN THE MATTER OF MITSUO YONEJI 
REVOCABLE TRUST DATED NOVEMBER 27, 1985
NO. CAAP-15-0000188  
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
(T. NO. 13-1-0004 (JKW))  
APRIL 16, 2020 
GINOZA, CHIEF JUDGE, FUJISE and LEONARD, JJ.
OPINION OF THE COURT BY GINOZA, CHIEF JUDGE  
This appeal arises from a Petition for Surcharge 
(
Petition), case number T.No. 13-1-0004, filed by Petitioner-
Appellant Neil Yoneji (
Petitioner Trustee Neil), as Successor 
Trustee of the Mitsuo Yoneji Revocable Trust dated November 27, 
1985 (Mitsuo Trust), seeking a surcharge against Mary Yoneji 
(Mary), a beneficiary of the Mitsuo Trust. Petitioner Trustee 
Neil appeals from a Judgment in favor of Mary entered by the 
Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit (Circuit Court).1 
1 The Honorable Kathleen N.A. Watanabe presided.  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Petition alleges, inter alia, that due to Mary's 
refusal to release information about trust properties, her 
conversion of trust assets, and her refusal to return the assets, the Mitsuo Trust was forced to initiate, and successfully litigated, two prior civil lawsuits against her during which the Mitsuo Trust incurred significant attorneys' fees and costs. The Petition also contends Mary filed a counterclaim in one of those lawsuits that the Mitsuo Trust successfully defended against. The Petition thus seeks to surcharge Mary, as a beneficiary of the Mitsuo Trust, the attorneys' fees and costs incurred by the Mitsuo Trust in litigating to recover losses caused by Mary and the interest on assets that Mary removed from the Mitsuo Trust.
2 
In denying the Petition, the Circuit Court ruled that: 
the Petition was barred by the doctrine of res judicata; Petitioner Trustee Neil failed to timely request attorneys' fees in one of the prior lawsuits under Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 54(d)(2); Petitioner Trustee Neil had 
waived the claims in the Petition; and laches applied. The 
Circuit Court also held that, pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 607-14.5 (2016), the claims in the Petition were 
frivolous and thus awarded attorneys' fees and costs totaling 
$19,377.66 in favor of Mary and against Petitioner Trustee Neil. 
On appeal, Petitioner Trustee Neil asserts two points 
of error: (1) the Circuit Court erred in denying the Petition against Mary because he was authorized and obligated to recoup the trust losses, Mary is subject to surcharge for her breach of trust as a co-beneficiary, and the surcharge claim is not barred by res judicata or any other form of waiver, laches, or untimeliness; and (2) the Circuit Court abused its discretion in

that she is alleged to have misdirected away from the Mitsuo Trust. Marycontends these issues are among the claims in one of the prior lawsuits. On appeal, Petitioner Trustee Neil focuses the Petition on recovering onlyattorney's fees and costs incurred in the prior litigation and lost interest.

awarding Mary attorneys' fees and costs because the claims in the 
Petition were not frivolous. 
We hold that the claims in the Petition are not barred 
due to res judicata, waiver, laches or untimeliness.  Further, we recognize that pursuant to the Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 104 (Am. Law Inst. 2012), Petitioner Trustee Neil had a legal basis to bring the Petition against Mary, as a co-beneficiary of the Mitsuo Trust, to the limited extent that he alleged Mary participated in a breach of trust regarding the Mitsuo Trust. Thus, the Circuit Court erred in ruling that the Petition's claims were frivolous and in awarding attorneys' fees and costs to Mary. 
We vacate the Circuit Court's rulings on the Petition 
and remand this case for further proceedings.
I. Background 
The Grantor for the Mitsuo Trust was Mitsuo Yoneji 
(Mitsuo), and the primary assets of the Mitsuo Trust were two 
commercial properties (Commercial Properties) on the island of 
Kaua# i. The Mitsuo Trust provided for distributions to Mitsuo's 
sons, Owen Yoneji (O
wen) and Neil Yoneji (Neil), and to the 
children of Owen and Neil. Owen and his wife Charlene Yoneji 
(Charlene) had one daughter, Mary. Neil and his wife Claire 
Yoneji (Claire) had two sons, Brandon Yoneji (Brandon) and Rylan 
Yoneji (Rylan).3 
The Circuit Court found, and it is undisputed by the 
parties, that the Commercial Properties are co-owned by four 
family trusts: the Mitsuo Trust (15%); the Yoneji Revocable Family Trust dated August 21, 1998 (Yoneji Family Trust)(42.5%), 
for which Neil and Claire are trustees; the Revocable Trust of

Owen Kazuo Yoneji dated January 11, 1994 (
Owen Trust)(21.25%); 
and the Revocable Trust of Charlene Tsuruko Yoneji dated January 
11, 1994 (Charlene Trust)(21.25%). 
To put the Petition in context, we first discuss the 
two prior lawsuits in which the Petition alleges the Mitsuo Trust incurred attorneys' fees and costs due to Mary's conduct.
A. First Lawsuit – Partition Action 
On November 21, 2008, Neil, as Successor Trustee of the 
Mitsuo Trust, and Neil and Claire, as trustees of the Yoneji Family Trust, filed a "Complaint for Partition of Real Properties" (Complaint for Partition) in Civil No. 08-1-0225 
against Mary, as trustee of the Owen Trust and Charlene Trust. 
The Complaint for Partition, filed in the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit, alleged that neither the Owen Trust nor the Charlene Trust had replied to requests from the Mitsuo Trust and the Yoneji Family Trust for information regarding management of the Commercial Properties, thereby asserting there was a "failure on the part of the co-tenants to properly own and manage the properties." 
On February 24, 2009, the Circuit Court entered its 
"Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Granting Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment as to All Defendants Filed on January 8, 2009" (Partition FOFs/COLs/Order). In its 
FOFs and COLs, the Circuit Court, inter alia, (1) found that the 
parties could not agree on the co-ownership and management of the Commercial Properties, (2) designated the respective ownership interests of the four family trusts, (3) concluded that Neil was properly appointed as Successor Co-Trustee of the Mitsuo Trust, and (4) concluded that if the Commercial Properties were incapable of being partitioned in kind, a partition by sale may be the appropriate remedy. The attached Order (1) concluded that Neil, as Successor Trustee of the Mitsuo Trust, and Neil and Claire, as trustees of the Yoneji Family Trust, were entitled to summary judgment as to all named Defendants, (2) set forth instructions for a partition sale, including permission for the parties to purchase the Commercial Properties, and (3) retained 
4 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
jurisdiction to determine the parties' post-sale claims and 
entitlements, and to hold a hearing to consider confirmation of sale of the Commercial Properties, as needed. 
On January 4, 2011, the Circuit Court entered an order 
granting a Motion for Confirmation of Sale, confirming the sale of the Commercial Properties to the Yoneji Family Trust as the highest bidder at public auction. No appeal was filed.
B. Second Lawsuit – Conversion and Unjust Enrichment 
On October 26, 2009, Neil, as Successor Trustee of the 
Mitsuo Trust, and Neil and Claire, as trustees of the Yoneji 
Family Trust, filed a Complaint in Civil No. 09-1-0282 against Mary and Charlene, in their individual capacities, asserting various tort and equitable claims including, inter alia, conversion of trust assets from the Mitsuo Trust and unjust enrichment through retention of said assets.
4 The Complaint, 
filed in the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit, additionally requested that "the Court order that defendants pay Plaintiffs' costs and attorneys' fees[.]" 
On February 22, 2013, Charlene filed a Motion for 
Summary Judgment in response to the Complaint. 
On March 20, 2013, Mary filed a Counterclaim against 
Neil and Claire, in their respective trustee capacities, alleging that they were unjustly enriched by benefitting from using Mary's personal money to have expenses paid related to the Commercial Properties. 
In pretrial hearings, the Circuit Court granted 
Charlene's Motion for Summary Judgment, ruling that Charlene was not liable for any counts alleged in the Complaint. The Circuit Court also granted summary judgment in favor of Mary on the constructive fraud, conspiracy, prima facie tort, and constructive trust claims asserted against her. The Circuit Court also awarded Mary attorneys' fees and costs for claims 
4 We refer to this lawsuit as the "Second Lawsuit". In this section,
except as noted, references to "Neil and Claire" refer to their capacities in
the Second Lawsuit, i.e.  Neil, as Successor Trustee of the Mitsuo Trust, and
Neil and Claire, as trustees of the Yoneji Family Trust. 
5 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
brought against her by Neil and Claire in their individual 
capacities.5 
A jury trial was held regarding the remaining claims of 
conversion and unjust enrichment against Mary in the Complaint and the claims asserted in Mary's Counterclaim. 
On May 1, 2013, in a Special Verdict Form, the jury 
found that: (1) Mary was liable for conversion and unjust enrichment in the total amount of $129,645.59; (2) Mary had not proven her counterclaim for unjust enrichment against Neil or Claire in their respective trustee capacities; and (3) nothing should be awarded to Mary in restitution for personal monies spent on legitimate business expenses for the Commercial Properties. 
On January 27, 2014, the Circuit Court entered an 
Amended Judgment with regard to Charlene. On February 25, 2014, Neil and Claire in their respective trustee capacities filed a timely notice of appeal from the Circuit Court's Amended Judgment regarding Charlene. 
On March 7, 2014, the Circuit Court entered an Amended 
Final Judgment with regard to the verdict against Mary. The Amended Final Judgment ordered that the converted funds from the Mitsuo Trust and the net rental income related to the Commercial Properties be apportioned between the four family trusts in accordance with their respective ownership interests in the Commercial Properties. The Amended Final Judgment also awarded costs in favor of Neil and Claire in their respective trustee capacities and against Mary in the amount of $32,256.94, and "dispose[d] of all claims remaining in this action." 
On April 7, 2014, Neil and Claire in their respective 
trustee capacities filed a notice of appeal from the Circuit Court's Amended Final Judgment regarding Mary. 
5 The written orders granting summary judgment were entered on May 1,
2013, the same date as the jury verdict on the remaining claims.

C.  Current Probate Action - Petition for Surcharge 
On July 10, 2014, Petitioner Trustee Neil, in his 
capacity as Successor Trustee for the Mitsuo Trust, filed the 
Petition in this probate action, T.No. 13-1-0004. The Petition alleges that it seeks to surcharge Mary as a co-beneficiary of the Mitsuo Trust for the attorneys' fees, costs and interests incurred by the Mitsuo Trust related to the prior two lawsuits and in defending against Mary's counterclaim in the Second Lawsuit. The Petition relies, in part, on the Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 104. The Petition asserts that: (1) as trustee of the Mitsuo Trust, Petitioner Trustee Neil has a fiduciary duty pursuant to Hawai# i law, common law, and the 
Mitsuo Trust document to protect trust assets; and (2) Mary, as a co-beneficiary of the Mitsuo Trust, may be surcharged for waste caused to a trust, i.e.
, litigation expenses arising from the 
First and Second Lawsuits. As an additional basis for surcharge, the Petition alleges that co-beneficiary Mary instituted "volunteer, wasteful litigation" via her Counterclaim that was rejected by the jury in the Second Lawsuit, and thus Petitioner Trustee Neil is entitled to attorneys' fees and costs incurred in defending against said Counterclaim. 
We note that the Petition's prayer for relief requests 
recovery beyond attorneys' fees, costs and interest.
6 However, 
on appeal, Petitioner Trustee Neil's appellate briefs limit his claim to the attorneys' fees and costs incurred in prior 
6 The Petition's prayer for relief requests in relevant part: 
B. That [co-beneficiary Mary] be surcharged in the
amount equal to the waste and lost income suffered by the
Trust as a result of the acts and omissions of [co-beneficiary Mary] described herein, including but notlimited to the amounts [Mary] withdrawal [sic] from theTrust bank account, as well as the profits from the rentsshe mis-directed away from the Trust, as well as theattorneys [sic] fees and cost incurred by [Neil] as Trusteeto recover said funds from the trust, including the fees forthis Petition. 
C. That the costs, expenses, and attorney's fees of
this Petition be taxed against [Mary] personally; and
D. That [Petitioner Trustee Neil] has such other and
further relief as may be just and proper.

litigation with Mary, and interest lost by the Mitsuo Trust due 
to Mary improperly taking trust assets. 
On July 10, 2014, Neil and Claire's sons and co-
beneficiaries of the Mitsuo Trust, Brandon Yoneji and Rylan Yoneji, joined in the Petition. 
On August 4, 2014, co-beneficiary Mary filed an 
Objection to the Petition, arguing, 
inter alia, that the Petition 
relitigates the same claims from the Second Lawsuit, and is barred by claim preclusion, waiver, untimeliness, and lack of statute or precedent authorizing the requests in the Petition. Co-beneficiary Mary's Objection also argued that she was entitled to attorneys' fees and costs because the Petition was frivolous. 
On September 17, 2014, the Circuit Court held a hearing 
on the Petition. At the hearing, Petitioner Trustee Neil's counsel argued that attorneys' fees was "not something that was actually litigated or could have been litigated" because no such remedy existed related to the tort claims in the Second Lawsuit. At the close of the hearing, the Circuit Court orally denied the Petition. 
On January 20, 2015, the Circuit Court entered its 
"Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying [Petitioner Trustee Neil's] Petition For Surcharge" (Order 
Denying Petition), based on, inter alia, claim preclusion (res 
judicata), untimeliness, waiver, laches, and lack of a statute, 
rule, or precedent authorizing the Petition's claims for attorneys' fees. The Circuit Court additionally found that "Petitioner's claim for attorneys' fees in the Petition should have been brought or could have been brought in the [Second Lawsuit], and that the Petition is barred by claim preclusion (res judicata)[,]" and that "there was no agreement or stipulation between [Petitioner Trustee Neil] and [co-beneficiary] Mary for any award of attorneys' fees regarding the claims in the [Second Lawsuit]." The Circuit Court awarded $18,585.93 in attorneys' fees and $791.73 in costs to co-

beneficiary Mary and against Petitioner Trustee Neil based on HRS 
§ 607-14.5.7 
On February 3, 2015, the Circuit Court approved a 
"Stipulation for HRCP Rule 54(b) Certification" stating there was no just reason for delay of entry of final judgment against Petitioner Trustee Neil. 
On March 11, 2015, the Circuit Court entered its 
Judgment, and this appeal followed.
D. Appellate Decisions and Remand in Second Lawsuit 
On July 31, 2015, in Yoneji v. Yoneji, 136 Hawai# i 11, 
354 P.3d 1160 (App. 2015) (Yoneji I
), this court vacated the 
Circuit Court's Amended Judgment in the Second Lawsuit with regard to Charlene and remanded the case for further proceedings. Id. at 21-22, 354 P.3d at 1170-71.
8 
On March 4, 2016, in Yoneji v. Yoneji, 137 Hawai# i 299, 
370 P.3d 704 (App. 2016) (Yoneji II), again related to the Second 
Lawsuit, this court held that the Circuit Court erred in granting 
summary judgment in favor of Mary on constructive fraud, conspiracy and constructive trust claims asserted against her. Further, we held that the Circuit Court erred in departing from a court-approved stipulation by precluding Neil, Claire and the Mitsuo Trust from admitting a Special Master's report at trial. We vacated the Circuit Court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Mary on the specified counts, and the award of attorneys' fees and costs to Mary. Id. at 311-14, 323, 370 P.3d at 716-19, 728. 
Importantly, we also vacated the March 7, 2014 "Amended Final Judgment" entered against Mary, and remanded the case to the Circuit Court for further proceedings. Id. at 323, 370 P.3d at 
728. 
7 Although Neil's children joined in the Petition, the Circuit Court's
Order specifically awarded attorneys' fees and costs to co-beneficiary Mary
"and against Petitioner[.]" (Emphasis added). 
8 Specifically, this court concluded that the Circuit Court (1) erred
in granting summary judgment in Charlene's favor as to the unjust enrichment,constructive fraud, conspiracy, and constructive trust claims asserted againsther, and (2) abused its discretion in granting Charlene's request forattorneys' fees and costs, in light of the error in granting summary judgmentfor her. Id. at 17-19, 21, 354 P.3d at 1166-68, 1170. 
9 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Subsequently, on remand after 
Yoneji I and Yoneji II, 
the Circuit Court held further proceedings, and on July 25, 2017, 
entered a "Final Judgment" (7/25/17 Judgment). On August 22, 
2017, Neil, as trustee of the Mitsuo Trust, and Neil and Claire, 
individually and as trustees of the Yoneji Family Trust, filed a timely notice of appeal from the 7/25/17 Judgment. That appeal, designated as CAAP-17-0000619, is pending in this court.
II. Standard of Review 
A. Questions of Law 
"Questions of law are reviewable de novo under the 
right/wrong standard of review." Ditto v. McCurdy, 90 Hawai# i 
345, 351, 978 P.2d 783, 789 (1999) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Best Place, Inc. v. Penn America Ins. Co., 82 Hawai# i 120, 123, 920 P.2d 334, 337 (1996)). Under the de novo 
or right/wrong standard, this court "examine[s] the facts and answer[s] the question without being required to give any weight to the trial court's answer to it." Pelosi v. Wailea Ranch 
Estates, 91 Hawai# i 478, 487, 985 P.2d 1045, 1054 (1999) 
(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).
B. Res Judicata 
"Application of res judicata is a question of law. 
Questions of law are reviewed de novo under the right/wrong standard." E. Sav. Bank, FSB v. Esteban, 129 Hawai# i 154, 157, 
296 P.3d 1062, 1065 (2013) (citations omitted).
C. Mixed Question of Law and Fact 
A COL is not binding upon an appellate court and is
freely reviewable for its correctness. [The appellate]
court ordinarily reviews COLs under the right/wrongstandard. Thus, a COL that is supported by the trialcourt's FOFs and that reflects an application of the correctrule of law will not be overturned. However, a COL thatpresents mixed questions of fact and law is reviewed underthe clearly erroneous standard because the court'sconclusions are dependent upon the facts and circumstancesof each individual case.

D. Waiver 
A waiver may be expressed or implied, and it may be
established by express statement or agreement, or by actsand conduct from which an intention to waive may bereasonably inferred. 
Generally, waiver is defined as an intentional
relinquishment of a known right, a voluntary relinquishmentof rights, and the relinquishment or refusal to use a right.To constitute a waiver, there must have existed a rightclaimed to have been waived and the waiving party must havehad knowledge, actual or constructive, of the existence ofsuch a right at the time of the purported waiver.

348, 376 (2002) (citations, internal quotation marks and brackets 
omitted). The existence of a waiver is generally a question of fact, unless the facts are undisputed: 
While the question whether a valid waiver exists is
generally a question of fact, "when the facts are undisputedit may become a question of law." Hawaiian Homes Comm'n v. 
Bush, 43 Haw. 281, 286 (1959) (citations omitted); see alsoStewart v. Spalding, 23 Haw. 502, 517 (1916) ("The questionof waiver is usually a mixed one of law and fact . . ., butwhere the facts are undisputed and are susceptible of butone reasonable inference it becomes one of law for the court."). 
Id. at 261–62, 47 P.3d at 376–77. 
III. Discussion 
A. The Petition Is Not Barred 
1. Res Judicata 
Mary claims that Petitioner Trustee Neil's Petition is 
barred by res judicata because, inter alia, the claims raised in 
the Petition are identical to those raised in the Second Lawsuit. 
Claim preclusion prohibits a party from relitigating a
previously adjudicated cause of action. Moreover, thejudgment of a court of competent jurisdiction is a bar to anew action in any court between the same parties or theirprivies concerning the same subject matter, and precludesthe relitigation, not only of the issues which were actuallylitigated in the first action, but also of all grounds ofclaim and defense which might have been properly litigatedin the first action but were not litigated or decided. The party asserting claim preclusion has the burden ofestablishing that (1) there was a final judgment on themerits, (2) both parties are the same or in privity with theparties in the original suit, and (3) the claim decided inthe original suit is identical with the one presented in theaction in question. 
11 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Esteban
, 129 Hawai# i at 159, 296 P.3d at 1067 (internal ellipses 
and emphasis in original omitted) (quoting Bremer v. Weeks, 104 
Hawai# i 43, 54, 85 P.3d 150, 161 (2004)). 
Based on our de novo review, we need not reach the 
question whether the claims in the Petition are identical to those raised in the Second Lawsuit. Rather, we conclude there is no final judgment in the Second Lawsuit for res judicata purposes, and thus the Circuit Court erred in holding that the Petition was barred by res judicata. In the Order Denying Petition, filed on January 20, 2015, the Circuit Court found that there was a final judgment in the Second Lawsuit given the trial court's Amended Final Judgment entered on March 7, 2014. However, on April 7, 2014, Neil and Claire had timely appealed from the March 7, 2014 Amended Final Judgment. 
In analyzing res judicata principles, the Hawai# i 
Supreme Court has recognized that "[a] judgment is final where the time to appeal has expired without appeal being taken." James W. Glover, Ltd. v. Fong, 42 Haw. 560, 574 (Haw. Terr. 1958) (emphasis added) (citations omitted); see also Esteban, 129 Hawai# i at 160, 296 P.3d at 1068 (analyzing res judicata in a 
foreclosure case and stating that "under Hawai# i law, there was a 
final judgment on the merits when the time to appeal the Foreclosure Judgment expired." (citation omitted)). Further, in Littleton v. State, 6 Haw. App. 70, 708 P.2d 829 (1985), this court examined the definition of "final judgment" in various contexts and stated: 
The expression "final judgment" is used in different
contexts in the law, but in every instance imports a meaningof conclusiveness. . . . It is also significant in the
application of the legal doctrine of res judicata . In that 
context, the supreme court, in Glover v. Fong, 42 Haw. 560
(1958), held that "[a] judgment is final where the time toappeal has expired without appeal being taken." Id. at 574. 
It follows from Glover that where an appeal has been taken,a judgment of the trial court is not final, at least for
purposes of res judicata . 
Id. at 75, 708 P.2d at 833 (emphasis added). 
We further note that the appeal from the March 7, 2014 
Amended Final Judgment in the Second Lawsuit resulted in our 
12 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
court's opinion in 
Yoneji II, which vacated the March 7, 2014 
Amended Final Judgment and remanded that case to the Circuit 
Court. On remand in the Second Lawsuit, the Circuit Court entered another judgment, the 7/25/17 Judgment. However, that judgment was also timely appealed and thus is not final for res judicata purposes. 
We hold that the Circuit Court erred in denying the 
Petition based on res judicata grounds. 
2. Timeliness 
Mary claims that Neil's Petition was properly denied 
because Neil failed, within fourteen days after the Judgment in the Second Lawsuit, to file a HRCP Rule 54(d)(2) motion requesting attorneys' fees. 
HRCP Rule 54(d)(2) provides:
(d) Costs; Attorneys' Fees. 
. . . . 
(2) Attorneys' Fees. 
(A)
 Claims for attorneys' fees and related nontaxable
expenses shall be made by motion unless the
substantive law governing the action provides for therecovery of such fees as an element of damages to beproved at trial. 
(B) Unless otherwise provided by statute or order of
the court, the motion must be filed and served nolater than 14 days after entry of an appealable orderor judgment; must specify the judgment and thestatute, rule, or other grounds entitling the movingparty to the award; and must state the amount orprovide a fair estimate of the amount sought. If directed by the court, the motion shall also disclosethe terms of any agreement with respect to fees to bepaid for the services for which claim is made. 
(C) The provisions of subparagraphs (A) and (B) do not
apply to claims for fees and expenses as sanctions forviolations of rules. 
(Emphases added). See also LeMay v. Leander, 92 Hawai# i 614, 
626, 994 P.2d 546, 558 (2000) ("[A]n award of attorney's fees 
must be based upon either statute, agreement, stipulation or precedent[.]" (citation omitted)). 
The requirements of HRCP Rule 54(d)(2) are not 
applicable here because the Petition is not a post-judgment motion in the Second Lawsuit. Rather, the Petition initiates an 
13 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
entirely separate proceeding in probate court. 
Thus, the timing 
requirements in HRCP Rule 54(d)(2)(B) do not apply. 
Thus, the Circuit Court erred in denying Neil's 
Petition based on untimeliness. 
3. Waiver 
Mary claims that the Circuit Court properly denied 
Neil's Petition based on waiver, because Neil waived his claims 
in the Second Lawsuit. Mary argues that Neil knew he had incurred attorneys' fees, and his "failure to . . . file any motion for attorney's fees in the [Second Lawsuit] shows his intention to waive any claim for attorney's fees." 
"To constitute a waiver, there must have existed a 
right claimed to have been waived and the waiving party must have had knowledge, actual or constructive, of the existence of such a right at the time of the purported waiver." Coon, 98 Hawai# i at 
261, 47 P.3d at 376 (emphasis added). 
Given the tort and equitable claims asserted in the 
Second Lawsuit, there were no grounds upon which to grant attorneys' fees to Neil in that lawsuit. The Hawai# i Supreme 
Court has recognized that "[g]enerally, under the American Rule, each party is responsible for paying for his or her own litigation expenses[,]" with the exception that "attorneys' fees may be awarded to the prevailing party where such an award is provided for by statute, stipulation, or agreement." TSA Intern. 
Ltd. v. Shimizu Corp., 92 Hawai# i 243, 263, 990 P.2d 713, 733 
(1999) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). 
In TSA, the supreme court held that the plaintiff's 
claims sounded in tort, and thus an award of attorneys' fees under HRS § 607-14 (Supp. 1998) was not proper. Id. at 264, 990 
P.2d at 734. Similarly, in Leslie v. Estate of Tavares, 93 Hawai# i 1, 7, 994 P.2d 1047, 1053 (2000), the supreme court noted 
that "an equitable claim for relief is not in the nature of assumpsit" and does not fall within HRS § 607-14 for purposes of awarding attorneys' fees. (Citations omitted). 
Additionally, 
the parties do not dispute the Circuit Court's finding that no agreement or stipulation exists between Neil and Mary for any 
14 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
award of attorneys' fees regarding the claims in the Second 
Lawsuit. 
Consequently there was no "right" for Neil to waive in
this regard.  
The Circuit Court therefore erred in ruling that Neil's
Petition is barred by waiver. 
4. Laches 
The Hawai# i Supreme Court has explained that: 
The doctrine of laches reflects the equitable maxim that
"equity aids the vigilant, not those who slumber on theirrights." Where applicable, it acts to bar a court fromconsidering an equitable action . . . because of aperception that it is more equitable to defendants andimportant to society to promote claimant diligence,discourage delay and prevent the enforcement of staleclaims. 
There are two components to laches, both of which must exist
before the doctrine will apply. First, there must have beena delay by the plaintiff in bringing his claim, and thatdelay must have been unreasonable under the circumstances.Delay is reasonable if the claim was brought without unduedelay after plaintiff knew of the wrong or knew of facts andcircumstances sufficient to impute such knowledge to him.Second, that delay must have resulted in prejudice todefendant. Common but by no means exclusive examples ofsuch prejudice are loss of evidence with which to contestplaintiff's claims, including the fading memories or deathsor material witnesses, changes in the value of the subjectmatter, changes in defendant's position, and interveningrights of third parties. 
Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Royal Aloha v. Certified Mgmt., 
Inc., 139 Hawai# i 229, 234, 386 P.3d 866, 871 (2016) (citation
omitted). Furthermore, laches is "a defense to legal and equitable claims alike." 
Id. at 236, 386 P.3d at 873.  
To the extent the Petition seeks recovery of attorneys'
fees and costs incurred by the Mitsuo Trust from litigating the First Lawsuit and the Second Lawsuit, it is reasonable that the Petition would not be filed until those lawsuits are concluded. Here, the Petition was filed four months after the Amended Final Judgment was filed in the Second Lawsuit. We do not view this asan unreasonable delay. 
Further, even assuming arguendo that the 
timing of Neil's Petition was unreasonable, the record does not appear to indicate that Mary suffered any prejudice. See Schefkev. Reliable Collection Agency, Ltd., 96 Hawai# i 408, 423, 32 P.3d 
52, 67 (2001) (holding that "[a]ssuming arguendo  a delay took  
 
 
15 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
place, nothing in the facts indicates that Defendants were 
prejudiced because Plaintiff did not bring a suit against them earlier, and thus, Defendants were not entitled to an instructionon laches.").  
Therefore, the Circuit Court erred in ruling that
Neil's Petition was barred by laches. 
B. The Petition Was Not Frivolous 
Neil claims the Circuit Court abused its discretion in
awarding Mary attorneys' fees and costs under HRS § 607-14.5 because: (1) his claims were not frivolous; and (2) the attorneys' fees awarded were not shown to have been necessarily and reasonably incurred.  
In its Order Denying Petition, the Circuit Court made
findings and conclusions that, pursuant to HRS § 607-14.5, the Petition and its claims were "frivolous and not reasonably supported by the facts and the law." 
The Circuit Court thus 
awarded Mary $18,585.93 in attorneys' fees and $791.73 in costsagainst Petitioner Trustee Neil.  
 
HRS § 607-14.5 provides in relevant part: 
(a) In any civil action in this State where a party seeks
money damages or injunctive relief, or both, against anotherparty, and the case is subsequently decided, the court may,as it deems just, assess against either party, whether ornot the party was a prevailing party, and enter as part ofits order, for which execution may issue, a reasonable sumfor attorneys' fees and costs, in an amount to be determinedby the court upon a specific finding that all or a portionof the party's claim or defense was frivolous as provided insubsection (b). 
(b) In determining the award of attorneys' fees and costs
and the amounts to be awarded, the court must find inwriting that all or a portion of the claims or defenses madeby the party are frivolous and are not reasonably supportedby the facts and the law in the civil action. In determiningwhether claims or defenses are frivolous, the court mayconsider whether the party alleging that the claims ordefenses are frivolous had submitted to the party assertingthe claims or defenses a request for their withdrawal asprovided in subsection (c). If the court determines thatonly a portion of the claims or defenses made by the partyare frivolous, the court shall determine a reasonable sumfor attorneys' fees and costs in relation to the frivolousclaims or defenses. 
(Emphases added). In addressing an award of attorneys' fees 
under HRS § 607-14.5, the Hawai# i Supreme Court stated that "[a]
frivolous claim has been defined as 'a claim so manifestly and  
16 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
palpably without merit, so as to indicate bad faith on the 
pleader's part such that argument to the court was not required.'" Canalez v. Bob's Appliance Serv. Ctr., Inc., 89Hawai# i 292, 300, 972 P.2d 295, 303 (1999) (quoting Coll v. 
McCarthy, 72 Haw. 20, 29, 804 P.2d 881, 887 (1991)).  
Petitioner Trustee Neil contends that, as a trustee of 
the Mitsuo Trust, he had a fiduciary duty to preserve the trust assets, to recover funds removed and misdirected by Mary, and to employ legal counsel and other professionals to litigate and secure assets wrongfully held by Mary. He also contends that thePetition's claim for a surcharge against Mary was proper citing, inter alia
, § 104 of the Restatement (Third) of Trusts and In re 
Campbell's Estate, 46 Haw. 475, 382 P.2d 920 (1963). We note that the Petition contained citations to these authorities, amongothers.  
 
Mary contends the Petition was improper because there 
is no statute, rule or precedent authorizing the Petition's claim
for attorneys' fees, costs, or interest. Mary also contends that"Hawaii has not adopted the Restatement (Third) of Trusts."   
The Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 104 provides:
§ 104 Liability of Beneficiary to Trust
(1) A beneficiary is not personally liable to the
trust except to the extent:
(a) of a loan or advance to the beneficiary fromthe trust;(b) of the beneficiary's debt to the settlorthat has been placed in the trust, unless thesettlor manifested a contrary intention;(c) the trust suffered a loss resulting from abreach of trust in which the beneficiaryparticipated; or(d) provided by other law, such as the law ofcontract, tort, or unjust enrichment.
(2) If a beneficiary is personally liable to thetrust, the trust is entitled to a charge against thebeneficiary's interest in the trust to secure thepayment of the liability. 
(Emphases added). 
Comment f to § 104 further provides: 
f. Loss resulting from breach of trust in which beneficiary
participated (Clause (c)) . A beneficiary owes a duty to the
other beneficiaries not to participate in a breach of trust.If a beneficiary participates in a breach of trust, causinga loss to the trust (see the definition of "loss" in § 100, 
17   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Comment b)[9], the beneficiary is personally liable to the
trust for all or part of the loss, as appropriate[.] 
Certainly, the beneficiary participates in a breach of trust
if the beneficiary performs, or joins in performing, an actthe beneficiary knows is a breach. Otherwise, the questionof what conduct of the beneficiary constitutes participationin a breach of trust is a question of degree. For example,a beneficiary has participated in a breach of trust if thebeneficiary induced the misconduct knowing that it would ormight be a breach of trust. However, mere knowledge of, orconsent to, the breach, without more, is insufficient toconstitute participation (though the beneficiary may beliable under the law of unjust enrichment for any resultingbenefit received[.] 
Petitions for surcharge initiated by beneficiaries 
against trustees for breach of trust are an established practice
in Hawai# i. See HRS § 560:7-306(b) and (d) (2006);  Matter of 10 
9 § 100 of the Restatement (Third) of Trusts addresses liability of a
trustee for breach of trust. Comment b provides, in relevant part: 
b(2). Attorney fees and other costs . The "make whole" 
objective (see Comment a) of recovery from a trustee under
Clause (a) may include, in an appropriate case, the attorneyfees and other litigation costs of a successfulplaintiff—that is, a co-trustee or successor trustee, or abeneficiary who qualifies for reimbursement from the trustunder § 88, Comment d. This element of recovery, however,is a matter of judicial discretion and not a routine part oftrustee liability for breach of trust (see id.). Among thefacts and circumstances courts consider in exercising theirjudgment in these matters are the nature and extent oftrustee misconduct in committing the breach, the conduct ofthe trustee in presenting the accounting or defending thesurcharge action, and the significance of imposing costs onthe trustee as a deterrent to misconduct. 
A trustee's payment of a beneficiary's costs is especially
significant and appropriate with regard to violations offiduciary duty that are unlikely to cause losses of the
types considered in Comment b(1) , such as a trustee's
improper refusal to provide information requested by a
beneficiary (see § 82(1)). (For other remedial actions thatmight serve a similar purpose in breach-of-trust cases of
this type, see § 91, Comment c.) 
Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 100 cmt. b(2) (emphasis added). 
10 At the time of Mary's alleged misconduct in 2008, HRS § 560:7-306(b)
& (d) provided, in relevant part: 
§560:7-306 Personal liability of trustee to third parties. 
. . . . 
(b) A trustee is personally liable for obligations arising
from ownership or control of property of the trust estate
and for torts committed in the course of administration of

Dowsett v. Hawaiian Tr. Co., 47 Haw. 577, 578, 393 P.2d 89, 91 (1964); Steiner v. Hawaiian Tr. Co., 47 Haw. 548, 575, 393 P.2d96, 111 (1964). However, Hawai# i
 courts have not previously 
addressed whether a beneficiary can be held liable as set forthin § 104 of the Restatement (Third) of Trusts.  
 
We first note that Mary’s contention, that Hawai# i has 
not adopted the Restatement (Third) of Trusts, is not altogether
correct. Hawai# i appellate courts have looked to the Restatement
(Third) of Trusts for guidance in other areas of trust law in numerous cases.  Additionally, we note that at least three 
other jurisdictions have applied or positively cited to § 104(1)(c) of the Restatement (Third) of Trusts.  We have not 
found any cases rejecting § 104(1)(c). 
1211 
 
Furthermore, permitting a trustee to surcharge a 
beneficiary who participates in a breach of trust is consistent with the traditional duty of loyalty a trustee owes to the trust's beneficiaries, i.e., "to administer the trust solely in 
the trust estate. 
. . . . 
(d) The question of liability as between the trust estate
and the trustee personally may be determined in a proceeding
for accounting, surcharge or indemnification or otherappropriate proceeding.

the interest of the beneficiaries." See Awakuni
, 115 Hawai# i at 
133, 165 P.3d at 1034 (referencing § 170(1) of the Restatement 
(Third) of Trusts, which states that "[t]he trustee is under a duty to administer the trust solely in the interest of the beneficiaries." (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also HRS § 560:7-301 (2018). 
In trusts with multiple beneficiaries, like this case, 
a trustee would be administering the trust in the interest of the other beneficiaries by petitioning for surcharge against a beneficiary who participates in a breach of trust. Cf. In re Campbell's Estate, 46 Haw. at 524, 382 P.2d at 954 (stating "[w]here a beneficiary brings a suit against his trustee which is groundless, the solicitor's fees and expenses of the trustee in defending the charge are to be paid out of the share of the complainant in the trust estate, and not charged against the estate generally nor a general fund by which co-beneficiaries would have to contribute." (quoting Patterson v. N. Tr. Co., 122 N.E. 55, 56 (Ill. 1919)). See also Helene S. Shapo et al., The 
Law of Trusts and Trustees § 191, at 558 (3rd ed. 2012) (stating that co-beneficiaries "are in a fiduciary relation to each other in the sense that one beneficiary may not secretly secure for himself a special advantage in the trust administration." (footnote omitted)). 
We thus conclude that adopting § 104(1)(c) and (2) of 
the Restatement (Third) of Trusts is consistent with existing Hawai# i precedent, and we therefore adopt those provisions. As 
set forth under § 104(1)(c) of the Restatement (Third) of Trusts, the liability of a beneficiary is limited to circumstances where "the trust suffered a loss resulting from a breach of trust in which the beneficiary participated[.]" (Emphasis added). In this regard, HRS Chapter 560, Article VII, Part 3 (Duties and Liabilities of Trustees) contains provisions related to a trustee's duties and standard of care, but does not contain provisions regarding a beneficiary's duties. Thus, we view the beneficiary's liability under § 104(1)(c) of the Restatement 
20 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(Third) of Trusts as limited to circumstances where the 
beneficiary 
participates in a breach of trust by a trustee. 
Here, the Petition alleges that Mary's father, Owen, 
became the Successor Trustee of the Mitsuo Trust in 1992, and Petitioner Trustee Neil was appointed a co-Successor Trustee in 1994. The Petition further alleges that the Mitsuo Trust's most significant assets were two commercial real estate properties, and that Owen managed those properties through his company Yoneji Enterprises until April 2008, when Owen's failing health prevented him from continuing in that capacity. The Petition asserts that Mary began removing money from the Mitsuo Trust bank account in April 2008, sent a letter to tenants of the commercial properties to send the monthly rent checks to her, and that through September or October of 2009, Mary deposited rent funds into accounts that she controlled. The Petition further alleges: 
40. Initially, [Petitioner Trustee Neil] was focused
on taking over management of the Trust following Owen's
illness in the fall of 2007 followed by his ultimate deathin September 2008. [Petitioner Trustee Neil] met with OwenYoneji several times during this time period including ameeting in April 2008 and they discussed the futuremanagement of the real properties in light of Owen'sdeclining health and the resignation of the long-standingbookkeeper, Setsuko Isoda[.]
41. Following this April 2008 meeting, [Petitioner
Trustee Neil] retained counsel to sort through themanagement of the properties and Trustee responsibilities ofthe Mitsuo Yoneji Trust. [Petitioner Trustee Neil's] counselwrote Owen Yoneji to address these issues. . . . Owen Yoneji never responded. 
The allegations in the Petition sufficiently indicate 
that Mary may have participated in a breach of trust by her 
father, Owen. In 2008, HRS § 560:7-302 (2006) stated in relevant part "[e]xcept as otherwise provided by the terms of the trust, the trustee shall observe the standards in dealing with the trust assets that would be observed by a prudent person dealing with the property of another[.]" Moreover, in 2008, HRS § 560:7-303 (2018) provided and still provides that "[t]he trustee shall keep the beneficiaries of the trust reasonably informed of the trust and its administration[.]" Given the Petition's allegations, it can be construed that Owen was not meeting these statutory obligations as a trustee who had been managing the commercial 
21  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
properties that were the main assets of the Mitsuo Trust. 
Further, after an April 2008 meeting between Owen and Petitioner Trustee Neil (who was also a beneficiary of the Mitsuo Trust), Petitioner Trustee Neil's counsel sent a letter to Owen about the trust, but Owen "never responded." 
We thus conclude that, under § 104(1)(c) and (2) of the 
Restatement (Third) of Trusts, the Petition sufficiently alleges that Mary may have participated in a breach of trust owed to the Mitsuo Trust by her father, Owen. 
Finally, the terms of the Mitsuo Trust provide that the 
"GRANTOR specifically gives the TRUSTEE, in the administration of the trust estate, all the powers, as may be applicable, given to a personal representative as enumerated in HRS § 560:3-715."
13 
and "[t]o employ legal counsel, accountants, investment counselors or other persons related to the administration or preservation of the trust estate." Thus, Petitioner Trustee Neil was authorized to retain attorneys to pursue claims against Mary in the Second Lawsuit seeking the return of trust assets. 
Given our conclusion that Petitioner Trustee Neil had a 
legal basis to assert the Petition under § 104(1)(c) and (2) of the Restatement (Third) of Trusts, to the extent it alleges Mary 
13 The Mitsuo Trust is dated November 27, 1985. In 1985, HRS § 560:3-
715 provided, in relevant part: 
§560:3-715 Transactions authorized for personal
representatives; exceptions. Except as restricted or
otherwise provided by the will or by an order in a formal
proceeding and subject to sections 531-28.5 and 531-29, andthe priorities stated in section 560:3-902, a personalrepresentative, acting reasonably for the benefit of theinterested persons, may properly: 
. . . . 
(21) Employ persons, including attorneys, auditors,appraisers, investment advisors, or agents, evenif they are associated with the personalrepresentative, to advise or assist the personalrepresentative in the performance of thepersonal representative's administrative duties;act without independent investigation upon theirrecommendations; and instead of actingpersonally, employ one or more agents to performany act of administration, whether or notdiscretionary[.] 
22 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
participated in a breach of trust regarding the Mitsuo Trust, and 
that the Petition is not barred by res judicata, being untimely, waiver or laches, the Circuit Court erred in finding that Petitioner Trustee Neil's Petition was frivolous.
14 
Therefore, the Circuit Court abused its discretion in 
granting Mary's request for attorneys' fees and costs under HRS § 607-14.5. We need not address whether the amounts awarded were reasonable. 
IV. Conclusion 
Based on the foregoing, we vacate the following entered 
by the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit: 
(1) "Judgment" filed March 11, 2015; and (2) "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order 
Denying Petitioner Neil Yoneji, Successor Trustee of the Mitsuo Revocable Trust Dated November 27, 1985's Petition for Surcharge (Filed 7/10/14)" filed January 20, 2015. 
This case is remanded to the Circuit Court for further 
proceedings consistent with this opinion.
