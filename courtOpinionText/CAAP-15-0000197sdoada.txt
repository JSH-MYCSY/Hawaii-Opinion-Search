v.
 
OLIVIA LING, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
KA'U DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 3DCW-14-0000428)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai 'i (State) charged 
Defendant-Appellant Olivia Ling (Ling) with harassment, in
 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 711-1106(1)(a)
 (2014).
1 After a bench trial, the District Court of the Third
 
2
Circuit (District Court)  found Ling guilty as charged.  The
 District Court entered its Judgment on February 25, 2015.
 
On appeal, Ling contends that the District Court erred
 
in: (1) denying her request for a continuance to obtain an
 
1HRS ยง 711-1106(1)(a) provides: 
(1) A person commits the offense of harassment if, with
intent to harass, annoy, or alarm any other person, that person:
 
(a)	 Strikes, shoves, kicks, or otherwise touches another
person in an offensive manner or subjects the other
person to offensive physical contact[.]

operable DVD player so that a DVD of the charged incident could
 
be introduced and played for the court; (2) admitting other act
 evidence in violation of Hawaii Rules of Evidence Rule 404(b)
 (Supp. 2015); and (3) improperly limiting her cross-examination
 of the complaining witness, in violation of her right to
 confrontation. 
The State concedes error on Ling's first point of 
error, and we agree with the State's concession. There is no dispute that the DVD of the charged incident constituted relevant and admissible evidence. The State had initially planned to introduce the DVD and play it at trial but refrained from doing so because the DVD player it had brought was inoperable. Prior to resting, Ling moved for a continuance to obtain an operable DVD player so that she could introduce the DVD for consideration by the District Court. The District Court denied the request for a continuance, and it entered its verdict without viewing the DVD. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the District Court abused its discretion in denying Ling's request for a continuance. See State v. Villiarimo, 132 Hawai
'i 209, 216-17, 
320 P.3d 874, 881-82 (2014). 
In light of our resolution of Ling's first point of
 
error, we need not address the other points of error she raises
 on appeal.
 
Based on the foregoing, we vacate the District Court's
 
Judgment and remand the case for a new trial.
