OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
PORTFOLIO RECOVERY ASSOCIATES, LLC, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
HARRY D. HUFFMAN, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 1RC13-1-7292)
 
ORDER
 
(1) VACATING THE NOVEMBER 25, 2015 ORDER
AND JURISDICTION IS RETURNED TO THIS COURT;
AND
 
(2) THE APPEAL IS DISMISSED
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that:
 
(1) On October 8, 2015, the court temporarily remanded
 
this case to the District Court of the First Circuit (district
 court) to enter, within ten days from the date of the order, an
 amended order on Plaintiff-Appellee Portfolio Recovery
 Associates, LLC's (Appellee) September 17, 2015 District Court
 Rules of Civil Procedure (DCRCP) Rule 60(b) motion to vacate the
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
March 9, 2015 judgment entered against Defendant-Appellant
 
Harry D. Huffman and dismiss the underlying case, Civil No.
 1RC13-1-7292. The court further ordered the district court clerk
 to file, within fifteen days from the date of the order, a
 supplemental record on appeal with all documents filed after
 May 20, 2015, to return jurisdiction to the appellate court; 
(2) On October 14, 2015, before the ten-day period for
 
the district court to file an amended order expired, the district
 court clerk filed a supplemental record on appeal that indicates
 the district court took no further action on Appellee's September
 17, 2015 motion;
 
(3) On November 23, 2015, thirty days after the
 
deadline for the district court clerk to file a supplemental
 record on appeal expired, the district court clerk filed a second
 supplemental record on appeal, indicating that on October 8,
 2015, Appellee filed an amended DCRCP Rule 60(b) motion to vacate
 the judgment and dismiss the underlying case without prejudice,
 which the district court granted on October 16, 2015; 
(4) On November 25, 2015, the court again temporarily
 
remanded this case to the district court with more explicit
 language requiring the district court clerk to wait until the
 district court files an amended order on Appellee's September 17,
 2015 motion before filing a supplemental record on appeal; and
 
(5) Based upon the second supplemental record on
 
appeal, filed November 23, 2015, it appears the temporary remand
 was unnecessary, and Appellee intends to dismiss the appeal
 because the district court vacated the judgment and dismissed the
 underlying case.
