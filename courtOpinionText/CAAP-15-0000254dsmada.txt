 DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
AND
 
(2) DISMISSING ALL PENDING MOTIONS AS MOOT
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
jurisdiction over this appeal that Defendant-Appellant Marcelo
 
Magno Lopez, Jr. (Appellant Lopez), has asserted from the
 Honorable Bert I. Ayabe's (1) January 5, 2015 judgment on a
 decree of foreclosure and (2) February 23, 2015 post-judgment
 order denying Appellant Lopez's amended motion for
 reconsideration pursuant to Rule 60(b) of the Hawai
'i Rules of 
Civil Procedure (HRCP), because Appellant Lopez's appeal is
 untimely under Rule 4(a)(3) of the Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP).
 

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Although Appellant Lopez's March 27, 2015 notice of 
appeal designates the February 23, 2015 post-judgment order as 
the appealed order, the appealable judgment in this matter is actually the January 5, 2015 judgment on the decree of foreclosure, and a timely appeal from the January 5, 2015 judgment on the decree of foreclosure would automatically entitle an appellant to appellate review of the February 23, 2015 post-judgment order, because a "notice of appeal shall be deemed to appeal the disposition of all post-judgment motions that are timely filed after entry of the judgment or order." HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). Nevertheless, as explained below, Appellant Lopez's March 27, 2015 notice of appeal is untimely, and, thus, the Hawai
'i Intermediate Court of Appeals lacks appellate 
jurisdiction. 
Pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 667­
51(a)(1) (Supp. 2014), the January 5, 2015 judgment on the decree
 of foreclosure is an appealable final judgment. "When a civil
 appeal is permitted by law, the notice of appeal shall be filed
 within 30 days after entry of the judgment or appealable order." 
HRAP Rule 4(a)(1). Nevertheless, pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(3),
 Appellant Lopez extended the initial thirty-day time period under
 HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) for filing a notice of appeal by timely filing
 Appellant Lopez's November 17, 2014 amended HRCP Rule 60(b)
 motion to reconsider the January 5, 2015 judgment on the decree
 of foreclosure before the ten-day time limit (i.e., the ten-day
 time limit under HRCP Rule 59 post-judgment motion for
 reconsideration of the January 5, 2015 judgment on the decree of
 foreclosure) expired on January 15, 2015.
1 The fact that
 
Appellant Lopez filed his November 17, 2014 amended HRCP
 Rule 60(b) motion for reconsideration prematurely, i.e., prior to
 entry of the January 5, 2015 judgment on the decree of
 foreclosure, is irrelevant as to timeliness requirement under
 HRCP Rule 59 and HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). See, e.g., Saranillio v.
 
1
 Lopez filed his November 17, 2014 amended motion for
reconsideration after the circuit court announced its intention to grant
foreclosure against Lopez, but before the January 5, 2015 Judgment was
entered.

Silva, 78 Hawai 'i 1, 7, 889 P.2d 685, 691 (1995) ("HRCP [Rule] 59 
does not require that a motion be served after the entry of 
judgment; it imposes only an outer [ten-day] time limit on the service of a motion to alter or amend the judgment[.]"). Although Appellant Lopez cited HRCP Rule 60(b) (rather than HRCP Rule 59) in support of his motion for reconsideration, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i "ha[s] recognized that a motion for 
reconsideration can be filed pursuant to HRCP Rule 59(e) (motion to alter or amend judgment) or HRCP Rule 60 (motion for relief from judgment or order)." Cho v. State, 115 Hawai
'i 373, 382, 
168 P.3d 17, 26 (2007) (citation and block quotation omitted). With respect to the timeliness requirement under HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) for extending the time period to file a notice of appeal, "[a]n HRCP Rule 60(b) motion for relief from judgment may toll the period for appealing a judgment or order . . . if the motion is served and filed within ten (10) days after the judgment is entered." Lambert v. Lua, 92 Hawai
'i 228, 234, 990 
P.2d 126, 132 (App. 1999) (citation omitted); Simbajon v. Gentry, 81 Hawaii 193, 196, 914 P.2d 1386, 1389 (App. 1996). 
HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) "provides that the court has 90 days 
to dispose of [the] post-judgment [tolling] motion . . . , regardless of when the notice of appeal is filed." Buscher v. 
Boning, 114 Hawai
'i 202, 221, 159 P.3d 814, 833 (2007). 
"Although the rule does not address the situation in which a [post-judgment tolling] motion . . . is prematurely filed prior to the entry of final judgment, [the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i] 
will deem such motion filed immediately after the judgment becomes final for the purpose of calculating the 90-day period." Buscher v. Boning, 114 Hawai
'i at 221, 159 P.3d at 833. 
Consequently, the thirty-day time period under HRAP 
Rule 4(a)(3) for filing a notice of appeal from the January 5, 2015 judgment on the decree of foreclosure commenced upon entry of the February 23, 2015 post-judgment order denying Appellant Lopez's amended HRCP Rule 60(b) motion for reconsideration of the January 5, 2015 judgment on the decree of foreclosure. This thirty-day time period under HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) expired at the end 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of the day on Wednesday, March 25, 2015. Appellant Lopez did not
 
file his March 27, 2015 notice of appeal before the thirty-day
 time period under HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) expired at the end of the day
 on Wednesday, March 25, 2015. Therefore, Appellant Lopez's
 appeal is untimely under HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). The failure to file
 a timely notice of appeal in a civil matter is a jurisdictional
 defect that the parties cannot waive and the appellate courts
 cannot disregard in the exercise of judicial discretion. Bacon
 
v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or justice is authorized to change the jurisdictional requirements contained in Rule 4 of these rules."); HRAP Rule 26(e) ("The reviewing court for good cause shown may relieve a party from a default occasioned by any failure to comply with these rules, except the failure to give timely notice of appeal."). Therefore, the Hawai
'i Intermediate 
Court of Appeals lacks appellate jurisdiction over Appellant Lopez's appeal. 
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
 
case number CAAP-15-0000254 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions in CAAP­
15-0000254 are dismissed as moot.
