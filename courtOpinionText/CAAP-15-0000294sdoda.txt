v.
 
ANTHONY REZENTES, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
'EWA DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. IDTC-14-055712)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Leonard and Ginoza, JJ., with
Nakamura, Chief Judge concurring separately)
 
Defendant-Appellant Anthony Rezentes (
Rezentes) appeals
 
from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and
 
Plea/Judgment (Judgment), filed on March 4, 2015, in the District
 
1
Court of the First Circuit, 'Ewa Division (district court).  The
 
district court convicted Rezentes of excessive speeding, in

 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291C-105(a)(1) and
 
(2)
 (2007).2
 
On appeal, Rezentes argues that the district court
 
wrongfully convicted him because the charge was fatally
 insufficient due to its failure to allege that the offense took

 HRS § 291C-105(a)(1) and (2) provide: "No person shall drive a motor
vehicle at a speed exceeding . . . [t]he applicable state or county speed
limit by thirty miles per hour or more; or . . . [e]ighty miles per hour or
more irrespective of the applicable state or county speed limit."

place on a highway, an essential element; the court did not
 
properly advise him of his right to testify pursuant to Tachibana
 v. State, 79 Hawai
'i 226, 236, 900 P.2d 1293, 1303 (1995); and 
the court erroneously admitted evidence of the speed reading based on an insufficient foundation. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Rezentes's points of error as follows, and reverse the
 Judgment.
 
(1) Sufficiency of the charge. The failure of the 
charge to allege that the offense occurred on a highway was harmless. See HRS §§ 291C-21, -105(a) (2007); State v. Wheeler, 
121 Hawai
'i 383, 391, 219 P.3d 1170, 1178 (2009) ("It is well 
settled than an 'accusation must sufficiently allege all of the essential elements of the offense charged[.]'" (citation omitted). Wheeler does not support Rezentes's position because 
Rezentes did not object to the charge at trial and raises this argument for the first time on appeal. Thus, we analyze the issue according to the "liberal construction standard." State v. 
Tominiko, 126 Hawai
'i 68, 76, 266 P.3d 1122, 1130 (2011). 
Rezentes does not argue that he was prejudiced by the omission of the subject language. Further, the oral charge included the definition of "highway"; and at trial, Honolulu Police Department Officer Vincent J. Tripi (Officer Tripi) testified that he stopped Rezentes on the H-3, which was a public way, road, street, or highway. Thus, prior to challenging the sufficiency of the charge on appeal, the record establishes that Rezentes was informed of the nature of the charge against him.
(2) Foundation for speed reading. The State 
established that Officer Tripi's training in the use of the Stalker radar gun met the requirements indicated by the manufacturer. See State v. Gonzalez, 128 Hawai
'i 314, 325-26, 
288 P.3d 788, 799-800 (2012); Cf. State v. Amiral, 132 Hawai 'i 
170, 178-79, 319 P.3d 1178, 1186-87 (2014); State v. Apollonio, 130 Hawai
'i 353, 361-63, 311 P.3d 676, 684-86 (2013); State v.

Assaye, 121 Hawai 'i 204, 213-16, 216 P.3d 1227, 1236-39 (2009) 
State v. Gardner, No. SCWC-13-0002852, 2016 WL 1065400, at *4 
(Haw. Mar. 15, 2016). Officer Tripi testified that he took an eight-hour training course –- including classroom instruction, a practical exercise, and a written test -- administered by an authorized representative of Applied Concepts, the Stalker's manufacturer. Officer Tripi was provided with a Stalker operating manual, published by Applied Concepts. In his training, he learned that prior to each shift, he was to perform a display test, self test, and tuning fork test on the Stalker. He explained how he was taught to conduct the various tests. He passed the written test and received a qualification card. 
Rezentes argues that the district court erred in 
admitting Officer Tripi's testimony that he knew his training instructor was an authorized Applied Concepts representative because the instructor presented a card indicating such, and the officer knew the training manual was by Applied Concepts because "Applied Concepts" was printed on the cover or first page of the manual. Rezentes asserts that this testimony was inadmissible hearsay, in violation of Rules 801 and 802 of the Hawai
'i Rules 
of Evidence (HRE); violated the "best evidence rule," under HRE 
Rule 1002; and was not based on the officer's personal knowledge, 
in violation of HRE Rule 602. However, the HRE did not apply to the preliminary question of the speed reading evidence's admissibility. See HRE Rule 104(a) ("[p]reliminary questions 
concerning the . . . admissibility of evidence shall be determined by the court" and "[i]n making its determination the court is not bound by the rules of evidence except those with respect to privileges") and Commentary to Rule 104(a); see also HRE Rule 1101(d) (stating the HRE, other than respect to privileges, does not apply to "[t]he determination of questions of fact preliminary to admissibility of evidence when the issue is to be determined by the court under rule 104"). 
The State, however, did not adduce sufficient evidence 
to show that the Stalker was tested according to the manufacturer's recommended procedures. See Assaye, 121 Hawai

at 213, 216 P.3d at 1236. At trial, Officer Tripi was questioned
 
on cross-examination about how he conducted the tuning-fork test:
 
[Rezentes's Counsel] Q. And do you know how long
after the self-test concludes you have to perform the tuning
fork test?
 
[Officer Tripi] A. I don't recall exactly how much time.
 
Q. Mm-hm. 
And isn't it true the manual says that the
that the tuning fork test can only be done during a five-
minute interval following the self-test?
 
A. Possibly, yes. 
Q. And you testified earlier that the tuning forks
you were provided were calibrated to the equivalent of 25.25
miles per hour?
 
A. Correct.
 
Q. And as well as the equivalent of 40.25 an hour?
 
A. Correct.
 
Q. And do you know which fork you test first?
 
A. The two –- it just depends. I mean -– I think in
 
the manual, it does specify which one to use first.
However, I usually always use the 40.25 first and then, the
second, 25.25.
 
Q. You use the 40.25 –
 
A. Right.
 
Q. -– fork first?
 
A. Yes.
 
Q. And you kind of mentioned earlier the manual
mentions you do the 25 –- the lower –­
A. Right.
 
Q. -– tuning fork –­
A. Yes.
 
Q. -– first and -– and then followed by the higher -–
 
A. Right.
 
Q. -– speed? But you -– but you do it opposite?
 
A. 
I think, at times, I've done the 40.25 first, yes.

. . . . 
Q. And do you recall how far away from the antenna

you hold the tuning forks while doing this test?
 
A. Within a reasonable distance that -–
 
Q. Can you estimate reasonable distance?

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
A. Five inches.
 
Q. Five inches? Isn't it true that the manual
 
recommends you holding it within two inches of the antenna?
 
A. Okay, two inches.
 
Officer Tripi's testimony on these points casts serious 
doubt on whether he complied with Applied Concept's 
recommendations when conducting the tuning-fork test and, by extension, whether the radar gun was accurate when it was used to measure Rezentes's speed. Because the State failed to establish that the radar gun was tested according to the manufacturer's requirements, the district court abused its discretion in admitting the speed reading into evidence. Without the speed reading, there was insufficient evidence to convict Rezentes of excessive speeding. See Assaye, 121 Hawai
'i at 216, 216 P.3d at 
1239 (concluding where State failed to adduce substantial, admissible evidence of the speed at which defendant was traveling, State failed to prove every element of excessive speeding beyond a reasonable doubt and the judgment of conviction was reversed). 
Given the above, we need not address Rezentes' point of
 
error based on Tachibana. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of
 
Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, filed on March
 4, 2015, in the District Court of the First Circuit, 'Ewa
 Division is reversed.
