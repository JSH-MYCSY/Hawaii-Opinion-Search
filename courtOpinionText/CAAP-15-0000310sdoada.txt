IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
KAWIKA K. AKUI, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 13-1-1094)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, and Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Defendant-Appellant Kawika K. Akui ("Akui") appeals
 
from the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence ("Judgment"), which
 
the Circuit Court of the First Circuit ("Circuit Court") entered
 on March 4, 2015.
1/ Akui was charged with one count of Assault
 
in the Second Degree, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes
 ("HRS") ยง 707-711(1)(b) (Supp. 2012).
2/ Akui initially entered a
 
plea of not-guilty. On January 31, 2014, however, Akui changed
 his plea to guilty ("Change of Plea"). 
1/ The Honorable Glenn J. Kim presided. 
2/ That statute states in relevant part: 
(1) A person commits the offense of assault in the second
degree if: 
. . . . (b) The person recklessly causes serious or
substantial bodily injury to another[.]
  
Haw. Rev. Stat. ยง 707-711(1)(b).
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
On November 14, 2014, Akui filed a motion to withdraw
 
his guilty plea ("Motion to Withdraw"). In it, Akui contended
 
that his former counsel had not discussed with him the
 possibility of raising the defense of self-defense. On March 4,
 2015, the Circuit Court denied Akui's Motion to Withdraw and
 sentenced him, among other things, to an open, five-year term of
 imprisonment, with credit for time already served. Akui timely
 appealed from the Judgment and alleges on appeal that the Circuit
 Court abused its discretion (1) in not allowing him to withdraw
 his guilty plea prior to sentencing, and (2) in sentencing him to
 an "open" five-year term of imprisonment. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments they advance and the issues they raise, we resolve
 Akui's points of error as follows, and affirm.
 
(1) Akui asserts that the Circuit Court abused its
 
discretion when it denied his Motion to Withdraw because he is
 able to establish a plausible and legitimate grounds to withdraw
 his guilty plea. Specifically, Akui claims that "the record does
 not support that the specific defense of self-defense was
 discussed with [Akui] prior to his change of plea[,]" and that
 "only a lesser charge was discussed with him prior to his change
 of plea[.]" Akui's first point of error is without merit. 
A defendant does not have an absolute right to withdraw 
his guilty plea. State v. Topasna, 94 Hawai
'i 444, 451, 16 P.3d 
849, 856 (App. 2000) (citing State v. Merino, 81 Hawai 'i 198, 
223, 915 P.2d 672, 697 (1996)). Rather, pursuant to Hawai 'i 
Rules of Penal Procedure ("HRPP") Rule 32(d), 
[a] motion to withdraw a plea of guilty or of nolo contendere
may be made before sentence is imposed or imposition of
sentence is suspended; provided that, to correct manifest
injustice the court, upon a party's motion submitted no later
than ten (10) days after imposition of sentence, shall set
aside the judgment of conviction and permit the defendant to
withdraw the plea.
 
Haw. R. Penal P. 32(d). "Where the record pertaining to the 
motion to withdraw guilty plea is complete, . . . '[t]he defendant has the burden of establishing plausible and legitimate grounds for the withdrawal[,]'" by a preponderance of evidence. Topasna, 94 Hawai
'i at 451, 16 P.3d at 856 (quoting Merino, 81 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawai'i at 223, 915 P.2d at 697) (explaining that the State's 
reliance upon the plea is no longer applicable if the defendant 
fails to meet this initial burden). Moreover, when a defendant makes his or her motion to withdraw a plea before sentencing, as in this case, "the motion should be granted if the defendant has presented a fair and just reason for his request and the [prosecution] has not relied upon the guilty plea to its substantial prejudice." Id. (quoting Merino, 81 Hawai
'i at 223, 
915 P.2d at 697) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
There are two "fair and just" reasons for withdrawing a 
guilty plea: "(1) that the defendant did not knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waive the rights relinquished upon pleading guilty, or (2) that changed circumstances or new information justify withdrawal of the plea." Id. at 452, 16 P.3d 
at 857 (citing Merino, 81 Hawai
'i at 223-24, 915 P.2d at 697-98). 
Under the first reason, which Akui asserts applies here, the defendant is entitled to withdraw his guilty plea if, "(1) the defendant has not entered the plea knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily; (2) there has been no undue delay in moving to withdraw the plea; and (3) the prosecution has not otherwise met its burden of establishing that it relied on the plea to its substantial prejudice." Id. (quoting Merino, 81 Hawai
'i at 224, 
915 P.2d at 698). 
This court reviews the circuit court's denial of a 
motion to withdraw a guilty plea for abuse of discretion. See 
State v. Gomes, 79 Hawai 'i 32, 36, 897 P.2d 959, 963 (1995). 
However, since this case requires us to consider a constitutional inquiry as to whether Akui knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily entered his Change of Plea, we review this specific underlying issue de novo. Topasna, 94 Hawai
'i at 452, 16 P.3d at 
857 (quoting Merino, 81 Hawai 'i at 225, 915 P.2d at 699). 
Akui argues that the Memorandum of Pretrial ("Pretrial
 
Memorandum"), on which "Defense of Self/Other/Property" is 
indicated under the heading "DEFENSE/ISSUES," and the Notice of
 Intent to Rely Upon Other Crimes, Wrongs, Acts ("Notice of
 Intent"), which declared that evidence of prior wrongs "may be
 offered to prove that the [alleged victim] was the initial
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
aggressor in this case[,]" should not be used to determine
 
whether or not he was apprised of self-defense because the
 Pretrial Memorandum did not have his signature.
3/ Nevertheless,
 
the Circuit Court found that Akui unequivocally acknowledged the
 available defenses during the change of plea colloquy, and that
 former defense counsel's testimony was more credible than Akui's. 
Similar to Topasna, the Circuit Court addressed Akui
 
personally in open court in accordance with HRPP Rule 11(c). 
That is, the Circuit Court established Akui's name; corrected his
 age, level of education, and language competency on the change-
of-plea form; and confirmed that at the time of his hearing, Akui
 had a clear mind. Pursuant to HRPP Rule 11(c)(1), the Circuit
 Court questioned Akui as follows:
 
Q. Have you and your attorney discussed the nature
of this charge and what the State would have to prove before
you could be found guilty of this charge?
 
A. Yes
 
Q. You understand the nature of this charge?
 
A. Yes, I do.
 
Q. Has your attorney also explained to you possible
defenses you could raise to this charge if you wanted to go
to trial?
 
A. Yes, she did.
 
Q. You understand those defenses?
 
A. Yes.
 
In conformity with HRPP Rule 11(c)(2), the Circuit
 
Court discussed the maximum penalty provided by law for one count
 
of Assault in the Second Degree, and asked Akui if, after knowing
 the penalty, he still wanted to plead guilty. The Circuit Court
 then stated that there was no possibility of an extended term,
 after which Akui expressed his understanding, and said that he
 still wished to plead guilty.
 
Pursuant to HRPP Rule 11(c)(3), the Circuit Court also
 
confirmed that Akui understood that he had the right to plead not
 guilty, a right to a trial, and that at trial, "the prosecutors

 The Pretrial Memorandum was signed by Akui's counsel, the State
and the Circuit Court. Both the Pretrial Memorandum and Notice of Intent were
 
signed by another public defender.
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
have to present evidence to prove you're guilty beyond a
 
reasonable doubt[.]" Then the Circuit Court, in accordance with
 HRPP Rule 11(c)(4) stressed to Akui that if he pled guilty, he
 waived the right to a trial, as well as the right to file
 pretrial motions and appeal to the appellate court for anything
 in his case up until his Change of Plea. Akui answered each
 question in the affirmative. The Circuit Court then read Akui
 the required advisement concerning alien status. After all of
 this, the Circuit Court found that Akui had "voluntarily,
 knowingly, and intelligently entered his plea of guilty with a
 complete understanding of the nature of the charge against him
 and the consequences of the plea." 
The Circuit Court also found a sufficient factual basis
 
for Akui's guilty plea. See State v. Tachibana, 67 Haw. 573,
 
575-76, 698 P.2d 287, 290 (1985) (determining that after
 considering all of the information available to the court, there
 was a sufficient factual basis for the guilty plea). Moreover,
 Akui signed the form to change his plea on two separate
 occasions: first, after he and his defense counsel had discussed
 the entire form; and, second, while appearing before the Circuit
 Court following the change-of-plea colloquy described above. 
Insofar as this Circuit Court's decision here rests on 
its determination that defense counsel's testimony was more credible than Akui's, this court will not disturb the court's judgment as to the credibility of testimony. See Topasna, 94 
Hawai
'i at 461, 16 P.3d at 866 (citing State v. Balberdi, 90 
Hawai'i 16, 21, 975 P.2d 773, 778 (App. 1999)). In light of the 
above-summarized evidence, Akui did not meet his burden of presenting a fair and just reason for withdrawal of his guilty plea. As such, the Circuit Court did not err when it found that Akui entered his change of plea knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily. Since Akui failed to meet this initial burden, the State's reliance upon the plea is not an issue. Id. at 451, 16 
P.3d at 856 (citing Merino, 81 Hawai
'i at 223, 915 P.2d at 697). 
Therefore, the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Akui's Motion to Withdraw. 
5

(2) Akui contends that the Circuit Court abused its
 
discretion in sentencing him to an open five-year term of
 
imprisonment because he pled guilty rather than insisting on a
 trial and, thus, saved the State time and expense by
 "alleviat[ing] an already burdened court calendar[.]" Akui
 contends that a probation sentence would have been more
 appropriate because there was no applicable mandatory minimum or
 extended terms. We disagree.
 
The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has stated that: 
[A] sentencing judge generally has broad discretion in
 
imposing a sentence.  The applicable standard of review for
sentencing or resentencing matters is whether the court
 committed plain and manifest abuse of discretion in its
 decision. '[F]actors which indicate a plain and manifest
abuse of discretion are arbitrary or capricious action by the
judge and a rigid refusal to consider the defendant's
 contentions.' And, '[g]enerally, to constitute an abuse it
 must appear that the court clearly exceeded the bounds of
reason or disregarded rules or principles of law or practice
to the substantial detriment of a party litigant.' 
State v. Kong, 131 Hawai 'i 94, 101, 315 P.3d 720, 727 (2013) 
(quoting State v. Rivera, 106 Hawai 'i 146, 154-55, 103 P.3d 1044, 
1052-53 (2004) (format altered) (citations omitted), overruled on 
other grounds by State v. Maugaotega, 115 Hawai 'i 432, 442-43, 
168 P.3d 562, 572-73 (2007)). "The weight to be given the factors set forth in HRS ยง 706-606 in imposing sentence is a matter generally left to the discretion of the sentencing court, taking into consideration the circumstances of each case." Id. 
(quoting State v. Akana, 10 Haw. App. 381, 386, 876 P.2d 1331, 1334 (1994)). 
Here, the record demonstrates that the Circuit Court
 
weighed many factors before determining Akui's sentence. For
 example, the court allowed Akui to address the court and explain
 why he felt probation would be the appropriate sentence for the
 offense. Akui apologized to the court, gave various reasons why
 he pled guilty, and explained that he had two jobs at the time of
 the incident, and would like to have the opportunity to become a
 productive citizen in society. The record also shows that the
 Circuit Court considered Akui's Pre-Sentence Diagnosis and Report
 detailing Akui's criminal record. The Circuit Court found that
 Akui is "clearly a danger to the public." Akui has not

demonstrated that the Circuit Court abused its discretion in
 
weighing the factors as it did or in sentencing him to an open
 five-year term of imprisonment.
 
Therefore, the March 4, 2015 Judgment of Conviction and
 
Sentence entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is
 affirmed.
