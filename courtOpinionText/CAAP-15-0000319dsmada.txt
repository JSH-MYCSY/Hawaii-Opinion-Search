Upon consideration of the letter, filed March 10, 2016, 
by Defendant-Appellant Avery J. Dune (Appellant), pro se, and the 
record, it appears that (1) by letter filed December 2, 2015, Appellant requested directions for filing an opening brief; (2) on December 15, 2015, the court informed Appellant that "[t]he requirements for an opening brief are prescribed by Hawai
'i Rules 
of Appellate Procedure [(HRAP)] Rule 28"; (3) on February 9, 2016, the court granted Appellant a sixth extension of time for the opening brief to March 15, 2016. The court cautioned Appellant that no further extensions of time would be granted, NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
and failure to file the opening brief may result in the appeal
 
being dismissed, pursuant to HRAP Rule 30; and (4) Appellant did
 not file the opening brief but instead filed the March 10, 2016
 letter indicating she cannot file an opening brief that complies
 with HRAP Rule 28.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is
 
dismissed, pursuant to HRAP Rule 30.
