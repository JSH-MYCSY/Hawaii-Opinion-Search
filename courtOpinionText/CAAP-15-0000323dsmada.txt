(4) On July 10, 2015, the appellate clerk notified 
Appellants that they were in default of the opening brief and, 
pursuant to Hawai 'i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 30, the 
matter would be called to the court's attention on July 20, 2015, for such action as the court deems proper, which could include dismissal; 
(5) On July 23, 2015, the court granted Appellants
 
relief from default and a second extension of time for the
 opening brief to August 10, 2015. The court cautioned Appellants
 that any further default of the opening brief may result in
 sanctions, including the appeal being dismissed; and
 
(6)
 Thereafter, Appellants failed to file an opening
 
brief and took no further action in this appeal.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is
 
dismissed.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are
 
dismissed as moot.
