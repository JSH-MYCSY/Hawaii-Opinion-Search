Upon review of the record, it appears that:

Magsanide Tabuyo, Sr. (Rodillo) and Merlina Duldulao Tabuyo
 (collectively, Appellants), pro se, filed a notice of appeal;
 
(2) On April 29, 2015, the circuit court clerk filed
 
the record on appeal, and the appellate clerk notified the
 parties that the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief were
 due on or before May 11, 2015, and June 8, 2015, respectively;
 
(3) Appellants did not file either document, or request
 
an extension of time;
 
(4) On July 2, 2015, after the court discovered that 
Rodillo filed a bankruptcy petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court, District of Hawaii, Case No. 15-00244, on February 28, 2015, the court ordered any further proceedings in this appeal stayed, pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 362(a)(1) (2010) and Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 54(c), until the 
bankruptcy stay is lifted or terminated; 
(5) On October 2, 2015, Plaintiff-Appellee U.S. Bank
 
National Association filed a notice of vacating bankruptcy stay,
 which included a certified copy of the bankruptcy court's June
 24, 2015 order dismissing Rodillo's bankruptcy case;
 
(6) On November 6, 2015, the appellate clerk notified
 
Appellants that the time for filing the statement of jurisdiction
 and opening brief expired on July 6 and August 3, 2015,
 respectively, and, pursuant to HRAP Rule 30, the matter would be
 called to the court’s attention on November 16, 2015, for such
 action as the court deems proper, which could include dismissal;
