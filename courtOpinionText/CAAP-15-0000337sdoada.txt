IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI #I, Plaintiff-Appellee, 
v.
RAUL ROMERO LOPEZ, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CASE NO. 1DTC-14-010196)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Fujise, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Raul Romero Lopez ( Romero Lopez)
appeals from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and
Plea/Judgment ( Judgment) entered by the District Court of the
First Circuit, Honolulu Division ( District Court ) on March 19,
2015.  Romero Lopez contends that the District Court erred by:1
1.allowing the State to amend Count 1 of the
complaint; and
2.convicting him based on insufficient evidence.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, as well as the
relevant statutory and case law, we hold that the District Court
lost jurisdiction over this case when Romero Lopez demanded a
jury trial.  Accordingly, we vacate the Judgment and remand for
proceedings consistent with this order.
On April 14, 2014, Romero Lopez was stopped by a police
officer who saw him driving while allegedly using a mobile

electronic device.  On May 13, 2014, a complaint was filed in
District Court charging Romero Lopez with Operating a Vehicle
After License and Privilege Have Been Suspended or Revoked for
Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVLPSR-
OVUII) in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS )
§ 291E-62(a)(1) and/or (a)(2) (Supp. 2010), among other things. 
The complaint charged that Romero Lopez was subject to one year
of imprisonment for OVLPSR-OVUII under HRS § 291E-62(b)(3).
After a number of continuances, on February 19, 2015,
Romero Lopez appeared in District Court with counsel, pleaded not
guilty, and demanded a jury trial.  When the District Court
informed the parties that the case would be committed to the
First Circuit Court, the State raised a concern about the Hawai# i
Rules of Penal Procedure ( HRPP) Rule 48 deadline and orally moved
to amend the Count 1 sentencing charge to HRS § 291E-62(b)(2),
which called for thirty days imprisonment.  The District Court
granted the State's motion over Romero Lopez's objection.  The
District Court and the parties presumed that Romero Lopez was not
entitled to a jury trial on the amended charge, and proceeded to
a bench trial.  Romero Lopez was convicted.  This appeal
followed.
The parties disagree on whether the cumulative
penalties under HRS § 291E-62(b)(2) make the offense a petty
misdemeanor, for which there is no right to a jury trial.  State
v. Lindsey, 77 Hawai #i 162, 164-65, 883 P.2d 83, 85-86 (1994)
("[E]xcept in the most extraordinary circumstances, we do not
recognize the right to a jury trial for any offense where the
maximum term of imprisonment is not more than thirty days.")
(citations and footnote omitted).  We need not decide that issue
because the original charge under HRS § 291E-62(b)(3) gave Romero
Lopez the right to trial by jury.  HRS § 806-60 (2014) (charge
carrying penalty of six months or more in prison entitles
defendant to trial by twelve member jury).  Once Romero Lopez
demanded a jury, the District Court lost jurisdiction over the
matter.  State v. Villados, 55 Haw. 394, 395, 520 P.2d 427, 429

(1974).   The State's motion to amend had to have been made, if
at all, in the circuit court.  See State v. Kaulia, 128 Hawai #i
479, 482-83, 291 P.3d 377, 380-81 (2013).2
Because the District Court lost jurisdiction over this
matter when Romero Lopez demanded a jury trial, we vacate the
Judgment and remand for proceedings consistent with this order.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, February 28, 2019.

2Romero Lopez did not raise the jurisdictional issue.  To its credit,
the State identified the jurisdictional issue in its answering brief.  "The
lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter cannot be waived by the parties. 
If the parties do not raise the issue, a court sua sponte will, for unless
jurisdiction of the court over the subject matter exists, any judgment
rendered is invalid."  In re Rice, 68 Haw. 334, 335, 713 P.2d 426, 427 (1986)
