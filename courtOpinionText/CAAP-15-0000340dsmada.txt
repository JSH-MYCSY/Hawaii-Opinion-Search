ORDER

 
DISMISSING APPELLATE COURT CASE NUMBER
 
CAAP-15-0000340 FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
AND

 
DISMISSING AS MOOT ALL PENDING MOTIONS
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack

 
appellate jurisdiction over Defendants/Counterclaim-Plaintiffs/
 
Third-Party Plaintiffs/Appellants Ray Mendoza Peralta (Appellant
 Ray Peralta) and Novelita Jaramilla Peralta's (Appellant Novelita
 Peralta) appeal from the Honorable Randal G.B. Valenciano's
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
March 17, 2015 order granting Third-Party Defendant/Appellee
 
State Farm Fire and Casualty Company's (Appellee State Farm)
 motion for summary judgment as to Appellant Ray Peralta and
 Novelita Peralta's amended third-party complaint, because the
 circuit court has not yet reduced that particular order to a
 separate judgment.
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 641-1(a) (1993 & 
Supp. 2014) authorizes appeals to the Hawai
'i Intermediate Court 
of Appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i 
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." Based on this requirement under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has 
held that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 
76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). "Thus, based on 
Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 
Hawai
'i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008). Consequently, 
"[a]n appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 120, 
869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote omitted). On June 15, 2015, the circuit court clerk filed the record on appeal for appellate court case number CAAP-15-0000340, which does not include a final judgment on the March 17, 2015 interlocutory order. 
Although exceptions to the final judgment requirement 
exist under the doctrine in Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848) (the Forgay doctrine), the collateral order doctrine, and HRS § 641-1(b) (1993 & Supp. 2014), the March 17, 2015 interlocutory order does not satisfy the requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine, the collateral order doctrine, or HRS § 641-1(b). See Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai
'i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
702, 704 (1995) (regarding the two requirements for appealability 
under the Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai
'i 319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding 
the three requirements for the collateral order doctrine); HRS § 641-1(b) (regarding the requirements for an appeal from an interlocutory order). Absent an appealable final judgment on the March 17, 2015 interlocutory order, we lack appellate jurisdiction and Appellant Ray Peralta and Appellant Novelita Peralta's appeal is premature. Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number
 
CAAP-15-0000340 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions
 
in appellate court case number CAAP-15-0000340 are dismissed as
 moot.
