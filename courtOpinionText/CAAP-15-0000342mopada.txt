STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
RUDOLPH G. KING, JR., Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 14-1-1986)

 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant the State of Hawai 'i (the State) 
appeals from the Order Granting Defendant-Appellee Rudolph G. 
King, Jr.'s [(King's)] Motion to Dismiss Felony Information, 
which was filed in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit 
1
(Circuit Court)  on March 19, 2015 (Order Granting Motion to
 
Dismiss
). The Felony Information charged King with Burglary in
 
the Second Degree (Burglary 2) in violation of Hawaii Revised
 Statutes (HRS) § 708-811 (2014). 
I. BACKGROUND FACTS

 
For the purpose of King's motion to dismiss, the
 
following facts were not in dispute. On November 11, 2014, King
 
1
 The Honorable Dean E. Ochiai presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
entered the Times Supermarket, Kaimuki store, located at 3221
 
Waialae Avenue in Honolulu.  A loss protection officer (LPO)
 
observed King concealing merchandise and then exiting the store
 
without paying for that merchandise. The LPO detained King and
 issued him a trespass warning. The warning stated (in all
 capitalized letters): 
You are hereby advised that your presence is no longer
desired on the premises or property listed above and on all
properties listed on the back of this warning. This serves
 notice that you are not to return to said property for the
duration listed above. Violations of this warning will
subject you to arrest and prosecution for trespassing
pursuant to section 708-814 of the Hawaii Penal Code.
 
The back of the warning included the names and
 
addresses of all Times Supermarket stores, including the McCully
 
store, which is located at 1772 South King Street in Honolulu. 
The trespass warning was in effect from November 11, 2014,
 through November 11, 2015, and was signed by King, as well as by
 a police officer who was present. 
On December 18, 2014, at the McCully Times store, the
 
same LPO who observed and detained King at the Kaimuki store on
 November 11, 2014, saw King take a bone-in rib-eye roast from the
 meat section and place it in his backpack. King then exited the
 store without paying for the roast. The LPO detained King
 outside of the store and, after King was detained, King
 acknowledged that he had been previously issued a trespass
 warning. The LPO detained King until the police arrived, and
 King was arrested on suspicion of Burglary 2.

On December 20, 2014, King was charged by Felony
 
Information with Burglary 2.2 On January 30, 2015, King's
 
attorney, Deputy Public Defender Jason Kramberg (Kramberg), filed
 
a Motion to Dismiss Felony Information for Lack of Probable Cause
 
and/or De Minimis Violation pursuant to, inter alia, Hawai 'i 
3
Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 12 (Motion to Dismiss).  On
 
February 13, 2015, the State filed a memorandum in opposition to
 
King's motion.  On February 20, 2015, the Circuit Court held a
 
hearing.  At the hearing, King conceded that he should be charged
 
4
with Theft in the Fourth Degree  and Criminal Trespass in the
5
Second Degree,  which are both petty misdemeanors, but argued

Information correcting an erroneous spelling of King's first name in the
initial Felony Information. 
3 HRPP Rule 12 (2007) states, in relevant part:
 
(b) Pretrial motions. Any defense, objection, or
request which is capable of determination without the trial
of the general issue may be raised before trial by motion.
Motions may be written or oral at the discretion of the
judge. The following must be raised prior to trial:
. . . .
 (2) defenses and objections based on defects in the
charge . . . 
4 HRS § 708-833 (2014) provides:
 
§ 708-833 Theft in the fourth degree.  (1) A person
commits the offense of theft in the fourth degree if the
person commits theft of property or services of any value
not in excess of $100.
 
(2) Theft in the fourth degree is a petty
misdemeanor.
 
5
 HRS § 708-814 (2014) provides, in relevant part:
 
§ 708-814 Criminal trespass in the second degree.
(1) A person commits the offense of criminal trespass in the
second degree if:
 
. . . .
 
(b) The person enters or remains unlawfully in or
upon commercial premises after a reasonable

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
that the Burglary 2 charge was improper because the intent of the
 
burglary statute was not to feloniously penalize entry onto a
 property that was open to the public. After hearing arguments
 from both parties on the motion, the Circuit Court stated, in
 part:
 
The Court's of the belief that a trespass warning does
not give it -- does not give rise to having it become a
 
5(...continued)
 
warning or request to leave by the owner or

lessee of the commercial premises, the owner's
or lessee's authorized agent, or a police
officer; provided that this paragraph shall not
apply to any conduct or activity subject to
regulation by the National Labor Relations Act.
 
For the purposes of this paragraph,
"reasonable warning or request" means a warning
or request communicated in writing at any time
within a one-year period inclusive of the date
the incident occurred, which may contain but is
not limited to the following information:
 
(i)	 A warning statement advising the person
that the person's presence is no longer
desired on the property for a period of
one year from the date of the notice, that
a violation of the warning will subject
the person to arrest and prosecution for
trespassing pursuant to section
708-814(1)(b), and that criminal trespass
in the second degree is a petty
misdemeanor;
 
(ii) 	The legal name, any aliases, and a
photograph, if practicable, or a physical
description, including but not limited to
sex, racial extraction, age, height,
weight, hair color, eye color, or any
other distinguishing characteristics of
the person warned;
 
(iii) The name of the person giving the warning
along with the date and time the warning
was given; and
 
(iv)	 The signature of the person giving the
warning, the signature of a witness or
police officer who was present when the
warning was given and, if possible, the
signature of the violator[.]
. . . .
 
(3) Criminal trespass in the second degree is a petty
misdemeanor.

vehicle to charge a Burglary in the Second Degree. I see two
charges here. I see a Criminal Trespass in the Second
Degree and a Theft Fourth Degree charge just based upon all
that the Court has had to consider during the course of this
hearing.
So I'll grant the motion to dismiss the Burglary in

the Second Degree charge with prejudice. . . .
However, the State is free to refile other charges
that the facts in this case may give rise to.
. . . .
 
[H]e violated the trespass warning the moment he

stepped into the McCully store.
. . . .
 
To me it looks like two separate crimes here. He
 
stepped onto the property. That's Criminal Trespass 2. I'm
 just saying this for this hearing. And then none of these 
facts have been proven, and then he commits a theft.
I don't see a -- this is not like continuing course.
This is not like a -- a theft that occurs over time in
 which, yes, you can accumulate until you can get to felony
level theft. If it's embezzlement or whatever and you're
charged with a felony, that's fine with the Court. But this
 appears to be two discrete crimes.
. . . .
 
I think at this point the State is stretching this -­
what should be two petties into a Class C. 
On March 19, 2015, the court issued the Order Granting
 
Motion to Dismiss.  On April 16, 2015, the State timely filed a
 
notice of appeal. 
II. POINTS OF ERROR

 
The State raises a single point of error on appeal,
 
arguing that the Circuit Court erred in granting Defendant's
 Motion to Dismiss.
 III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
Like a Grand Jury Indictment, a Felony Information must
 
be based on probable cause to believe that the offense charged
 was committed. 
The Hawai' i Supreme Court has held that the de novo 
standard applies in appellate reviews of probable cause
determinations. State v. Navas,  81 Hawai' i 113, 123, 913
P.2d 39, 49 (1996). Probable cause refers to the "state of
 facts as would lead a person of ordinary caution or prudence
to believe and conscientiously entertain a strong suspicion
of the guilt of the accused." State v. Naeole, 80 Hawai' i 
419, 424, 910 P.2d 732, 737 (1996). Moreover, "probable
cause is generally based upon a combination of factors,
which together form a sort of mosaic, of which any one piece
by itself often might not be enough to constitute probable
 
5

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
cause, but which, when viewed as a whole, does constitute
probable cause." State v. Chong, 52 Haw. 226, 231, 473 P.2d
 
567, 571 (1970). Accordingly, we consider the totality of
the circumstances to determine, de novo, whether [there
existed probable cause].
 
State v. Ferrer, 95 Hawai 'i 409, 430-31, 23 P.3d 744, 765-66 
(App. 2001).
 
An appellate court reviews a trial court's ruling on a
 
motion to dismiss for de minimis
 violation for abuse of
 
discretion. State v. Rapozo, 123 Hawai 'i 329, 336, 235 P.3d 325, 
332 (2010). A court abuses its discretion if it clearly exceeds
 
the bounds of reason or disregards rules or principles of law or
 practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant. Id. 
The interpretation of a statute is a question of law
 
reviewed de novo. State v. Kuhia, 105 Hawai
'i 261, 269, 96 P.3d 
590, 598 (App. 2004) .
 
When interpreting a statute, our foremost obligation is to
ascertain and give effect to the intention of the
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the
language contained in the statute itself. And where the
 language of the statute is plain and unambiguous, a court's
only duty is to give effect to the statute's plain and
obvious meaning.

IV. DISCUSSION
 A. Probable Cause
 King was charged with Burglary 2, in violation of HRS
 
§ 708-811, which provides:
 
§ 708-811 Burglary in the second degree. (1) A
person commits the offense of burglary in the second degree
if the person intentionally enters or remains unlawfully in
a building with intent to commit therein a crime against a
person or against property rights.
 
(2) Burglary in the second degree is a class C

felony.
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
"Enter or remain unlawfully" is defined in HRS
 
§ 708-800 (2014) as follows:
 
"Enter or remain unlawfully" means to enter or remain
in or upon premises when the person is not licensed,
invited, or otherwise privileged to do so. A person who,
regardless of the person's intent, enters or remains in or
upon premises which are at the time open to the public does
so with license and privilege unless the person defies a
lawful order not to enter or remain, personally communicated
to the person by the owner of the premises or some other
authorized person.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
As both parties recognize, under a plain reading of the
 
above statutory language, the Burglary 2 statute includes the
 
situation at bar, as King is alleged to have intentionally
 entered Times Supermarkets' premises in defiance of a lawful
 order not to enter the premises, which had been personally
 communicated to King by an authorized person, i.e., Times
 Supermarkets' LPO, with the intent to commit a crime therein
 against property rights. King points to no ambiguity in the
 statute and we find none.
 
Citing Friends of Makakilo v. D.R. Horton-Schuler 
Homes, LLC, 134 Hawai
'i 135, 139, 338 P.3d 516, 520 (2014), King 
argues that even if the plain language of a statute is clear, the appellate court can nevertheless consider legislative history to ensure that its interpretation of the statute does not produce an absurd or unjust result contrary to legislative intent. However, King fails to cite any legislative history supporting his interpretation and fails to show that the plain language reading of HRS §§ 708-800 and 708-811 would produce an absurd or unjust result that is inconsistent with the policies of the Burglary 2 statute. 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
We recognize that Burglary 2 is a class C felony, which 
carries a maximum sentence of five years of imprisonment. HRS 
§§ 708-811(2), 706-660(1)(b) (2014). Criminal trespass in the second degree and theft in the fourth degree are both petty misdemeanors, punishable by a maximum of thirty days imprisonment for each offense. HRS §§ 708-814(3), 708-833(2), 706-663 (2014). Thus, charging King with the class C felony, rather than with the two petty misdemeanors, has the potential for far more serious consequences. Nevertheless, it appears from, inter alia, the Commentary to the Hawai
'i Burglary statutes that this potential 
result was understood by the drafters of the Model Penal Code provisions upon which Hawaii's Burglary statutes are based. 
6
Although not evidence of legislative intent,  the Commentary to
HRS §§ 708-810 and 708-811 bemoans the fact that the Burglary
 statutes, as written, have the potential for harsh consequences,
 and notes that reform may be necessary:
 
If we were writing on a clean slate, the best solution might
be to eliminate burglary as a distinct offense. . . . But we
are not writing on a clean slate. . . The needed reform must
therefore take the direction of narrowing the offense to
something like the distinctive situation for which it was
originally devised: invasion of premises under
circumstances specially likely to terrorize occupants.
 
(Quoting the commentary from the Model Penal Code Tentative Draft
 
No. 11, comments at 57 (1960).) Despite the Commentary, we must
 consider the relevant statute as adopted.
 
The Hawai
'i Supreme Court "has consistently reaffirmed 
the proposition that 'where the terms of a statute are plain, unambiguous and explicit, we are not at liberty to look beyond 
6
 See HRS § 701-105 (2014).
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
that language for a different meaning. Instead, our sole duty is 
to give effect to the statute's plain and obvious meaning.'" State v. Stan's Contracting, Inc., 111 Hawai
'i 17, 24, 137 P.3d 
331, 338 (2006) (quoting State v. Yamada, 99 Hawai 'i 542, 553, 57 
P.3d 467, 478 (2002) (quoting State v. Richie, 88 Hawai 'i 19, 30, 
960 P.2d 1227, 1238 (1998))). Thus, "this court cannot change the language of the statute, supply a want, or enlarge upon it in order to make it suit a certain state of facts. This is because we do not legislate or make laws." Seki ex rel. Louie v. Hawaii 
Gov't Emp. Ass'n, AFSCME Local No. 152, AFL-CIO, 133 Hawai
'i 385, 
408, 328 P.3d 394, 417 (2014) (citation omitted). 
Finally, as argued by King, a New Mexico Court of 
Appeals has held that entry into a commercial business establishment contrary to a no-trespass order does not constitute an "unauthorized entry" into the business under New Mexico's commercial burglary statute. However sound under the laws of New Mexico, that court's reasoning does not give us license to depart from the above-referenced Hawai
'i authorities. See State v. 
Archuleta, 346 P.3d 390 (N.M. App. 2014), cert. granted, 350 P.3d 91 (N.M. Jan. 26, 2015), cert. quashed, 367 P.3d 441 (N.M. May 11, 2015); but see State v. Kutch, 951 P.2d 1139, 1140-41 (Wash. App. 1998) (holding that a person whose invitation to be on premises has been expressly limited or revoked, and who exceeds that limitation, or contrary to the revocation enters the building with intent to commit a crime, engages in conduct that is both burglarious and felonious); State v. Ocean, 546 P.2d 150, 152-53 (Or. App. 1976) (similarly upholding burglary conviction 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
where unlawful entry element was based on prior bar from
 
premises), abrogation recognized by State v. Collins, 39 P.3d 925
 (Or. App. 2002).
 
Accordingly, we conclude that, in this case, the Felony
 
Information is supported by probable cause to charge King with
 Burglary 2.
 
B.	 De Minimis Violation
 HRS § 702-236 (2014) sets forth the bases for a court's
 
dismissal for de minimis offense:
 
§ 702-236 De minimis infractions. (1) The court may
dismiss a prosecution if, having regard to the nature of the
conduct alleged and the nature of the attendant
circumstances, it finds that the defendant's conduct:
(a)	 Was within a customary license or tolerance,
which was not expressly refused by the person
whose interest was infringed and which is not
inconsistent with the purpose of the law
defining the offense;
(b) 	Did not actually cause or threaten the harm or
evil sought to be prevented by the law defining
the offense or did so only to an extent too
trivial to warrant the condemnation of
 conviction; or
(c) 	Presents such other extenuations that it cannot
 reasonably be regarded as envisaged by the
legislature in forbidding the offense.
(2) The court shall not dismiss a prosecution under
subsection (1)(c) of this section without filing a written
statement of its reasons.
 
Notably, "insofar as the defendant advances a motion to
 
dismiss on de minimis grounds, it is the defendant, and not the
 
prosecution, who bears the burden of proof on the issue." State
 
v. Oughterson, 99 Hawai 'i 244, 256, 54 P.3d 415, 427 (2002). The 
defendant also bears the burden of establishing why dismissal of
 the charge as a de minimis infraction is warranted in light of
 the circumstances. Rapozo, 123 Hawai
'i at 331, 235 P.3d at 327. 
In ruling on a motion for relief pursuant to HRS
 
§ 702–236,
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
all of the relevant facts bearing upon the defendant's
conduct and the nature of the attendant circumstances
 regarding the commission of the offense should be shown to
the judge. Such a disclosure would then enable the judge to
consider all of the facts on this issue, so that he can
intelligently exercise a sound discretion, consistent with
the public interest, whether to grant the dismissal of a
criminal case. In addition, this court outlined a number of
factors for the trial court to consider in making its
determination, including (1) the background, experience and
character of the defendant; (2) knowledge on the part of the
defendant of the consequences of the act; (3) the
circumstances surrounding the offense; (4) the harm or evil
caused or threatened by the offense; (5) the probable impact
of the offense on the community; (6) the seriousness of the
punishment; (7) the mitigating circumstances; (8) possible
improper motives of the complainant or prosecutor; [and] (9)
any other data which may reveal the nature and degree of the
culpability in the offense committed by each defendant.
 
Id. at 343-44, 235 P.3d at 339-40 (citations and brackets
 
omitted, formatting altered) (citing State v. Park, 55 Haw. 610,
 
616, 525 P.2d 586, 591 (1974)).
 
In his motion to dismiss, King argued that his actions
 
did not cause or threaten the harm or evil sought to be prevented
 by HRS § 708-811 because that law was meant to apply to "invasion
 of premises under circumstances specially likely to terrorize
 occupants," and that it was "not meant to apply to instances of
 shoplifting from a commercial premises." At the hearing on his
 motion, King further argued that petty misdemeanors, which carry
 thirty-day maximum sentences, would be more appropriate charges
 for this criminal behavior than a class C felony, which can bring
 a five-year prison term. Although we have rejected these points
 as grounds for dismissal as a matter of law, they are
 nevertheless relevant factors in a de mininis analysis. King did
 not offer support for the other 
Rapozo factors, such as his
 
background and character, the circumstance surrounding the
 offense, any mitigating circumstances, improper motives of the
 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
complainant or prosecutor, or other data regarding the nature and
 
degree of his culpability.
 
The Circuit Court did not enter written findings of
 
fact and conclusions of law, and neither its oral ruling or its
 written order specifically state whether the court's ruling was
 based on King's probable cause argument or his de minimis
 violation argument. The court's on-the-record comments appear to
 indicate that its decision was based solely on whether there was
 probable cause to charge King under the Burglary 2 statute, as
 the court stated, inter alia, that the State was "estopped from
 filing a Burglary in the Second Degree charge on this case." The
 court mentioned certain factors that may be relevant to analysis
 under HRS § 702-236(1)(b) and/or (c), as the court: referenced
 that the trespass warning did not give notice that a violation
 could give rise to a Burglary 2 charge; stated that because the
 entry was into a different store, the court was less inclined to
 allow the State to go forward with the charge; and referenced the
 seriousness of the much greater punishment associated with the
 felony, as opposed to two petty misdemeanors. However, on this
 record, we cannot conclude that the Circuit Court exercised its
 discretion based on the request for dismissal on de minimis
 grounds. Therefore, on remand, the Circuit Court may further
 consider the issue of whether to dismiss the charge on de minimis
 grounds and, if it decides to do so, the court is instructed to
 make written findings that clearly state its reasons.
