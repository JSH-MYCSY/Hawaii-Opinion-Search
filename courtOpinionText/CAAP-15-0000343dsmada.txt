Appellants' appeal from the Honorable Joseph E. Cardoza's 
March 20, 2015 post-judgment order denying the Miller Appellants' post-judgment motion to alter or amend the February 9, 2015 judgment, because the underlying February 9, 2015 judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable final judgment under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2014), Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP), and the 
holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai 'i 
115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
The Miller Appellants' April 16, 2015 notice of appeal 
designates the appealed document as being the March 20, 2015 post-judgment order denying the Miller Appellants's HRCP Rule 59 post-judgment motion to alter or amend the February 9, 2015 judgment. HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees, and, "[a] post-judgment order is an appealable final order under HRS § 641-1(a) if the order ends the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be accomplished." Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 Hawai
'i 153, 157, 80 P.3d 974, 978 (2003) 
(citation omitted). For example, "[a]n order denying a motion for post-judgment relief under HRCP [Rule] 60(b) is an appealable final order under HRS § 641-1(a)." Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 Hawai
'i 
at 160, 80 P.3d at 981 (citation omitted). However, an appealable final judgment is a prerequisite to any circuit court order qualifying as an appealable post-judgment order. For example, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i recently held that, 
"[a]bsent an underlying appealable final judgment, the circuit court's rulings on a purported [HRCP] Rule 60(b) motion are interlocutory and not appealable until entry of such a judgment." Bailey v. DuVauchelle, 135 Hawaii 482, 491, 353 P.3d 1024, 1033 (2015) (citations omitted). In the instant case, the underlying February 9, 2015 judgment fails to satisfy the requirements for an appealable final judgment, and, thus, the March 20, 2015 post-judgment order will not be eligible for appellate review until the future entry of an appealable final judgment in this case.

Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner
 
. . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). HRCP
 
Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a
 separate document." Based on HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of
 Hawai
'i requires that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after 
the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has
 been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties
 pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins
, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 
P.2d at 1338. "Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order
 is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the
 parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." 
Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai
'i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 
1186 (2008). Furthermore,
 
if a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a case
involving multiple claims or multiple parties, the judgment
(a) must specifically identify the party or parties for and
against whom the judgment is entered, and (b) must (i)
identify the claims for which it is entered, and
(ii) dismiss any claims not specifically identified[.]
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (emphases added). 
For example: "Pursuant to the jury verdict entered on
(date), judgment in the amount of $___ is hereby entered in
favor of Plaintiff X and against Defendant Y upon counts I
through IV of the complaint." . . . . If the circuit court
 intends that claims other than those listed in the judgment
language should be dismissed, it must say so: for example,
"Defendant Y's counterclaim is dismissed," or "Judgment upon
Defendant Y's counterclaim is entered in favor of
 Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all other claims,
counterclaims, and cross-claims are dismissed."
 
Id. at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4 (emphasis added). 
When interpreting the requirements for an appealable final
 judgment under HRS § 641-1(a) and HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court
 of Hawai
'i has explained that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality, . . . and we should not make such searches
necessary by allowing the parties the option of waiving the
requirements of HRCP [Rule] 58. 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (citation omitted; 
original emphasis).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Although the instant case is a multiple-claim case in 
which Appellee AOAO Hololani's complaint asserted three separate 
and distinct counts and the Miller Appellants' counterclaim asserted seven separate and distinct counts, the February 9, 2015 judgment does not specifically identify the claim or claims on which the circuit court intends to enter judgment. Although the February 9, 2015 judgment contains a statement that there are no other causes of action, claims or other matters left to be adjudicated in this case, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has 
explained, 
[a] statement that declares "there are no other outstanding
claims" is not a judgment. If the circuit court intends
 
that claims other than those listed in the judgment language
should be dismissed, it must say so: for example,
"Defendant Y's counterclaim is dismissed," or "Judgment upon
Defendant Y's counterclaim is entered in favor of
 Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all other claims,
counterclaims, and cross-claims are dismissed."
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4 
(emphases added). Without specifically identifying the claim or 
claims on which the circuit court intends to enter judgment, and without expressly dismissing the remaining claims, the February 9, 2015 judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable final judgment under HRS § 641-1(a), HRCP Rule 54(b), HRCP Rule 58 and the holding in Jenkins. 
Absent an underlying appealable final judgment, the
 
circuit court's March 20, 2015 post-judgment order is
 interlocutory and not eligible for appellate review until the
 future entry of an appealable final judgment. Bailey, 135 Hawaii
 
at 491, 353 P.3d at 1033. Under the present circumstances, the
 Miller Appellants' appeal is still premature, and we lack
 appellate jurisdiction. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellee AOAO Hololani's
 
September 23, 2015 motion to dismiss appellate court case number
 CAAP-15-0000343 for lack of appellate jurisdiction is granted,
