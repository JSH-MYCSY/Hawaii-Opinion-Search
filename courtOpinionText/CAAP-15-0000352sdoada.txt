IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
DYLAN THEDE, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 11-1-0041)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)

 
Defendant-Appellant Dylan Thede (Thede), pro se,
 
appeals from the Judgment entered by the Circuit Court of the
 
Fifth Circuit (Circuit Court).1 The Judgment was entered in the
 
amount of $71,788.22 in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee Bank of
 America, N.A. (BOA) and against Thede, pursuant to the Circuit
 Court's grant of BOA's motion for summary judgment. On appeal,
 Thede contends that: (1) the Circuit Court erred in granting
 BOA's motion for summary judgment; (2) BOA's complaint should
 have been dismissed for insufficiency of service of process; and
 (3) BOA lacked standing to pursue its claim. We affirm.

I.
 
A complaint was filed by FIA Card Services, N.A. (FIA),
 
seeking to collect amounts allegedly owed by Thede on his credit
 
card account. Thede filed an answer to the complaint. The
 caption of the complaint was later amended to name BOA as the
 plaintiff. BOA filed a motion for summary judgment, which was
 set for a hearing on February 19, 2015. Thede filed a motion to
 continue the hearing for ninety days, which the Circuit Court
 denied on February 18, 2015. The record on appeal does not
 contain any written opposition to BOA's motion for summary
 judgment, and Thede did not appear at the hearing. The Circuit
 Court granted BOA's motion for summary judgment and filed its
 Judgment on May 28, 2015. 
II.
 
We resolve the arguments raised by Thede on appeal as
 
follows:
 
1. The Circuit Court did not err in granting BOA's
 
motion for summary judgment. In support of its motion, BOA
 submitted the affidavit of Wendy Parnell (Parnell), who
 represented that she was a custodian of records for BOA, along
 with exhibits which showed: (1) that BOA was a subsidiary of Bank
 of America Corporation and the successor in interest to FIA,
 which had merged into BOA; (2) that Thede had opened a credit
 card account with FIA; (3) that Thede had used the account or
 authorized its use to acquire goods, services, or cash advances;
 and (4) that Thede had made certain payments on the account, but
 had stopped making payments and owed an outstanding balance of
 $71,440.22. 
Contrary to Thede's contentions, Parnell's affidavit 
was not deficient and BOA met its burden of showing that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Hawai
'i Rules of 
Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 56(c), (e) (2000). To the extent 
2
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that Thede contends that the Circuit Court erred in denying his
 
motion to continue the hearing on BOA's summary judgment motion,
 we disagree. Thede's continuance motion was based on his
 assertions that he was unable to attend the hearing, he wanted
 more time to pursue settlement, and there were motions the
 Circuit Court needed to address before he could properly frame
 his defense. However, Thede did not explain why he was unable to
 attend the hearing, and he did not specify and the record does
 not disclose what motions the Circuit Court needed to address
 before he could frame his defense. We conclude that the Circuit
 Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Thede's motion for
 a continuance. 
2. Thede contends that the service of the complaint
 
on him was insufficient. However, Thede did not file a motion
 claiming insufficiency of service of process, and he filed an
 answer to the complaint without asserting this defense. 
Accordingly, Thede waived his claim of insufficiency of service
 of process. See HRCP Rule 12(b) and (h) (2000).
 
3. Thede's claim that BOA lacked standing is without
 
merit. The record reflects that BOA is the successor in interest
 to FIA, that Thede had opened a credit card account with FIA, and
 that Thede was in breach of his payment obligations under the
 account.

2We note that in his opening brief, Thede refers to
documents he claims were submitted to the Circuit Court but were 
omitted from the record on appeal. However, it is Thede'sresponsibility, as the appellant, "to provide a record . . . thatis sufficient to review the points asserted and to pursueappropriate proceedings in the court or agency from which theappeal is taken to correct any omission." Hawai
'i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure Rule 11(a) (2010). Thede did not make the documents he claims were omitted part of the record on appeal,and our decision in this case is based on the record before us.
