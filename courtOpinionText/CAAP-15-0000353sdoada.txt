v. 
NICHOLE SKINNER, Defendant-Appellee,
and 
EXODUS BAIL BONDS,
Real Party in Interest-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 14-1-1468)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Real Party in Interest-Appellant Exodus Bail Bonds
 
(Exodus) appeals from an "Order Denying Exodus Bail Bond
 
Company's Motion to Enlarge Time or Motion to Reconsider Motion
 to Set Aside Bail Forfeiture" (Order Denying Motion to
 Reconsider) entered March 20, 2015, in the Circuit Court of the
 First Circuit (circuit court).
1 On appeal, Exodus contends that
 
the circuit court erred by (1) denying Exodus's "Motion to
 Enlarge Time or Motion to Reconsider Motion to Set Aside Bail
 Forfeiture" (Motion to Reconsider), and (2) ruling that Exodus's 
original motion to set aside bail forfeiture judgment was

untimely.2
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we affirm.
 
In State v. Vaimili , 131 Hawaii 9, 313 P.3d 698 
(2013), the Hawai 'i Supreme Court stated: '
[State v. Ranger Ins. Co. Ex rel James Lindblad, Inc., 83
Hawai'i 118, 925 P.2d 288 (1996)] explained that, “HRS §
804–51 permits the filing neither of a second motion seekingto show ‘good cause why execution should not issue’ nor anymotion after the closing of the thirty-day window.” 83Hawai‘i at 124 n. 5, 925 P.2d at 294 n. 5 (emphases inoriginal). Hence, “the surety's sole recourse from thedenial of the motion to set aside ... is by way ofappeal[.]” Id. 
Id. at 17, 313 P.3d at 706 (brackets omitted). In this case, a
 
"Judgment and Order of Forfeiture of Bail Bond" (Bail Forfeiture
 
Judgment) was entered on November 17, 2014. On December 10,
 2014, Exodus was served via certified mail with notice of the
 Bail Forfeiture Judgment. On January 12, 2015, Exodus filed a
 "Motion to Set Aside Bail Forfeiture."
3 The circuit court denied
 
the motion as untimely, ruling that it was filed thirty-three
 (33) days after receipt of notice of the Bail Forfeiture
 Judgment, outside of the thirty (30) day time limit provided in
 Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 804-51 (2014).
4 The circuit
 
2 Exodus's opening brief fails to comply with Hawai' i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28 in many ways, which alone raises the
potential for dismissal of the appeal and/or waiver of issues sought to beraised. State v. Miles, 135 Hawai' i 525, 526 n.2, 354 P.3d 178, 179 n.2
(2015). However, because we seek to address cases on the merits wherepossible, we address Exodus's arguments to the extent they are discernable.Id. Exodus's counsel is cautioned that future noncompliance with HRAP Rule 28
may result in sanctions.

 On appeal and in its Motion to Reconsider, Exodus contends that its
Motion to Set Aside Bail Forfeiture was submitted to the circuit court for
 calendaring on January 8, 2015, and that the motion was then filed on January
12, 2015.

court entered its "Findings of Fact and Order Denying Exodus Bail
 
Bonds Company's Motion to Set Aside Bail Forfeiture" (Order
 Denying Motion to Set Aside) on February 3, 2015. Under HRS
 § 804-51, "the appealable event is the order denying the motion
 to set aside the judgment of forfeiture." 
State v. Camara , 81
 
Hawai'i 324, 329, 916 P.2d 1225, 1230 (1996). Exodus did not 
file a timely notice of appeal from the February 3, 2015 Order
 Denying Motion to Set Aside.
5 Instead, on March 2, 2015, Exodus
 
filed the Motion to Reconsider. Thus, Exodus filed an
 unpermitted and untimely second motion seeking to set aside the
 Bail Forfeiture Judgment. Pursuant to Vaimili, Exodus's Motion
 to Reconsider was not allowed under HRS § 804-51. 131 Hawai
'i at 
17, 313 P.3d at 706. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Order Denying
 
Exodus Bail Bond Company's Motion to Enlarge Time or Motion to
 
4(...continued)
criminal cause, the court shall immediately enter up
judgment in favor of the State and against the principal or
principals and surety or sureties on the bond, jointly and
severally, for the full amount of the penalty thereof, and
shall cause execution to issue thereon immediately after the
expiration of thirty days from the date that notice is given
via personal service or certified mail, return receipt
requested, to the surety or sureties on the bond, of the
entry of the judgment in favor of the State, unless before
the expiration of thirty days from the date that notice is
given to the surety or sureties on the bond of the entry of
the judgment in favor of the State, a motion or application
of the principal or principals, surety or sureties, or any
of them, showing good cause why execution should not issue
upon the judgment, is filed with the court. If the motion or
application, after a hearing held thereon, is sustained, the
court shall vacate the judgment of forfeiture and, if the
principal surrenders or is surrendered pursuant to section
804-14 or section 804-41, return the bond or recognizance to
the principal or surety, whoever shall have given it, less
the amount of any cost, as established at the hearing,
incurred by the State as a result of the nonappearance of
the principal or other event on the basis of which the court
forfeited the bond or recognizance. If the motion or
application, after a hearing held thereon, is overruled,
execution shall forthwith issue and shall not be stayed
unless the order overruling the motion or application is
appealed from as in the case of a final judgment.
