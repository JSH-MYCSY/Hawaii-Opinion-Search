STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
ZACHERY BOND, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 13-1-1017)
 
ORDER
 
(1) GRANTING OCTOBER 20, 2015 MOTION TO
DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION;
AND
 
(2) ALL PENDING MOTIONS ARE DISMISSED AS MOOT
(Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of (1) Defendant-Appellant Zachary
 
Bond's (Bond) October 20, 2015 motion to dismiss appellate court
 
case number CAAP-15-0000356 for lack of appellate jurisdiction
 over Bond's appeal from the Honorable Karen S.S. Ahn's April 15,
 2015 judgment of conviction, (2) the lack of any memorandum by
 Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai
'i (State) to Bond's October 20, 
2015 motion, and (3) the record, it appears that we lack NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appellate jurisdiction over Bond's appeal from the Honorable 
Karen S.S. Ahn's April 15, 2015 judgment of conviction against Bond. 
Bond is asserting an appeal pursuant to Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS) § 641-11 (Supp. 2014), which provides that "[a]ny party deeming oneself aggrieved by the judgment of a circuit court in a criminal matter, may appeal to the intermediate appellate court, subject to chapter 602 in the manner and within the time provided by the rules of the court." HRS § 641-11 (Supp. 2015). "The sentence of the court in a criminal case shall be the judgment." HRS § 641-11 (Supp. 2015). Thus, "[u]nder HRS § 641-11, the sentence of the court in a criminal case is the judgment from which an appeal is authorized[,]" and where "[t]here [is] no conviction and sentence in . . . [a] case, there can be no appeal under HRS § 641-11[.]" State v. Kealaiki, 
95 Hawai
'i 309, 312, 22 P.3d 588, 591 (2001) (internal quotation 
marks and citations omitted).

This case qualifies as a criminal matter  because Bond
was tried and convicted of assault in the second degree in
 violation of 707-711 (2014), which is a class C felony that is
 punishable by imprisonment pursuant to HRS § 706-660 (2014). 
However, the April 15, 2015 Judgment, on its face, shows that the
 circuit court had not yet finished sentencing Bond when the
 circuit court entered the April 15, 2015 judgment. 
The April 15,
 
2015 judgment expressly provides for a subsequent hearing to
 determine restitution scheduled for June 2, 2015, which was later
 rescheduled for August 28, 2015.

authorized constitutes a crime." HRS § 701-107(1) (2014).

Under similar circumstances, this court in State v. 
Kilborn, 109 Hawai 'i 435, 127 P.3d 95 (App. 2005), held: 
[J]udgments of conviction are not final unless they include
the final adjudication and the final sentence. In the
 instant case, the sentence imposed was not the final
sentence because the district court expressly left open the
possibility that its sentence of Kilborn might include an
order requiring Kilborn to pay restitution. The court did
 
not finally decide whether it would order Kilborn to pay
restitution and, if so, in what amount. Consequently, the
December 5, 2003 Judgment is not final and, because it is
not final, it is not appealable.
 
Id. at 442, 127 P.3d at 102 (emphases added).
 
As in Kilborn, the judgment in this case expressly
 
provided for a hearing on restitution to occur after the date of
 
the judgment.2 Because the April 15, 2015 judgment expressly
 
leaves open the possible future award of restitution, it did not
 include Bond's final sentence. Consequently, the April 15, 2015
 judgment was not final and appealable under HRS § 641-11 and the
 holding in 
Kilborn.
 
Although Bond filed an April 22, 2015 notice of appeal
 
from the non-final April 15, 2015 judgment, Bond's April 22, 2015
 notice of appeal did not divest the circuit court of jurisdiction
 under these circumstances.
 
The general rule is that the filing of a notice of
appeal divests the trial court of jurisdiction over the
appealed case. . . . The general rule, however, assumes
that the notice of appeal is valid under the applicable
statutory provisions and procedural rules. Where the notice
 of appeal is jurisdictionally defective, filing the notice
does not transfer jurisdiction from the trial court to the
appellate court.
 
State v. Ontiveros, 82 Hawai 'i 446, 448-49, 923 P.2d 388, 390-91 
(1996) (citations, internal quotation marks and brackets). 
Because the April 15, 2015 judgment was not final and appealable,
 
2
 The situation in this case and Kilborn is distinguishable from the
 
situation where the judgment does not expressly leave open the possible future
award of restitution. In the latter situation, the judgment on it face would
appear to be a final judgment.
 
-3­ NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Bond's April 22, 2015 notice of appeal was jurisdictionally 
defective, and the circuit court retained jurisdiction to subsequently enter the October 12, 2015 amended judgment that imposes the remainder of the sentence by awarding restitution in the amount of $17,534.45. Consequently, the October 12, 2015 amended judgment is a validly appealable final judgment pursuant to HRS § 641-11. We take judicial notice that Bond, in CAAP-15­0000875, filed a notice of appeal on November 10, 2015 from the amended judgment. 
Accordingly,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Bond's October 20, 2015
 
motion to dismiss appellate court case number CAAP-15-0000356 for
 lack of appellate jurisdiction is granted and this appeal is
 dismissed.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are
 
dismissed as moot.
