(collectively, Appellants)  appeal from the Judgment for
Possession in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee Association of
 
Apartment Owners of Century Center, Inc. (AOAO). The Judgment
 for Possession was accompanied by a Writ of Possession, and they
 were both filed on March 24, 2015, in the District Court of the
 First Circuit (District Court). 
1Nomura was a named defendant, and Lee moved for intervention,
but his motion was denied.

On appeal, Appellants argue that the District Court
 
lacked jurisdiction over the AOAO's summary possession action
 
because Appellants had sufficiently raised a claim to title to
 divest the District Court of jurisdiction. See Hawaii Revised
 
Statutes (HRS) § 604-5(d) (1993) ("The district courts shall not
 have cognizance of real actions, nor actions in which the title
 to real estate comes in question . . . .").
2 In particular,
 
Appellants argue that their claim to title is superior to that of
 the AOAO because the AOAO lacked the authority to conduct a non­judicial foreclosure, and therefore, the non-judicial foreclosure
 by which the AOAO acquired its interest in the subject unit was
 void. We recently considered essentially the same claim to title
 presented here by Appellants in Association of Apartment Owners
 of Century Center, Inc. v. Nomura, No. CAAP-15-0000119, 2016 WL
 2940855 (Haw. App. May 11, 2016) (Memorandum Opinion). 
Consistent with our previous decision in Nomura (No. CAAP-15­0000119), we conclude that Appellants' claim to title in the
 instant case was sufficient to divest the District Court of
 Jurisdiction. 
Accordingly, we vacate the March 24, 2015, Judgment for
 
Possession issued by the District Court, and we remand the case
 to the District Court with instruction to dismiss the summary
 possession action for lack of jurisdiction.
