NO. CAAP-15-0000363
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
ROBERT FLUBACHER, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P. NO. 14-1-00004)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, and Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Robert Flubacher appeals from the 
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Denying Petition 
to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner from Custody Without a Hearing, filed on April 2, 2015, in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit ("Circuit Court").
1 On appeal, Flubacher contends that the Circuit Court 
erred by denying his Hawai 'i Rules of Penal Procedure ("HRPP") 
Rule 40 Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner from Custody ("Petition"), filed January 27, 2014, and his First Amended Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner from Custody ("Amended Petition"), filed August 21, 2014, without a hearing. 
Flubacher contends that his extended sentence was
 
illegal under Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000) and
 Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584 (2002). He claims that he is not
 requesting retroactive application but only "application of
 Apprendi, Ring, and 'Cunningham' [v. California, 549 U.S. 270

(2007)] by itself, separate from Blakely [v. Washington, 542 U.S. 
296 (2004)] and [United States v.] 'Booker'[, 543 U.S. 220 (2005)]." In the alternative, Flubacher claims that he is entitled to retroactive application of Apprendi and that Loher v. State, 118 Hawai
'i 522, 193 P.3d 438 (App. 2008) overruled in 
part by State v. Auld, 136 Hawai 'i 244, 254, 361 P.3d 471, 481 
(2015), is not controlling authority in his case. 
Flubacher asserts that the remaining claims in his
 
petition were not waived. However, Flubacher only provides an
 argument with respect to his claim that the Circuit Court
 improperly considered a fact not in evidence–that he hit a woman
 with a hammer–when deciding to impose extended terms of
 imprisonment.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments they advance and the issues they raise, we resolve
 Flubacher's points of error as follows, and affirm:
 
On June 12, 2003, Flubacher pled guilty to charges in
 
five different cases: (1) Cr. No. 01-1-2788 (from December 3-10,
 2001, drove a car without the owner's permission and without a
 driver's license); (2) Cr. No. 01-1-2789, ( on December 4, 2001,
 kicked a woman in the face while taking her purse and her
 father's car, hit two men with a hammer, and stabbed one man in
 the knee); (3) Cr. No. 02-1-0089 (on December 8, 2001, robbed the
 7-11 store on Kapiolani Blvd. while brandishing a knife); (4) Cr.
 No. 02-1-0090 (on December 9, 2001, robbed the French Wrench gas
 station while brandishing a knife); and (5) Cr. No. 02-1-0125 (on
 December 6, 2001, robbed the 7-11 store on Ala Moana Blvd. while
 brandishing a knife).
 
On September 12, 2003, Flubacher was sentenced in each
 
of the five cases. The Circuit Court then heard the State's
 Motion for Extended Term of Imprisonment in relation to each of
 the five cases. The court granted the motion, finding that
 Flubacher was a "multiple offender" within the meaning of Hawaii
 Revised Statutes § 706-662(4)(a), that he was on parole in Cr.
 No. 96-1373 when he committed the instant offenses, that he posed
 a serious threat to the community, and that his long-term
 
2

incarceration was necessary for the public. Consequently, the
 
court extended Flubacher's sentences as follows: 
In Cr. No. 01-1-2788, five year term of imprisonment to
 
ten years; in Cr. No. 01-1-2789, twenty year term of imprisonment
 to life with the possibility of parole in Count I, ten year terms
 of imprisonment to 20 years in Counts II and III, and five year
 terms of imprisonment to ten years in Counts IV and V; and in Cr.
 Nos. 02-1-0089, 02-1-0090, and 02-1-0125, twenty year terms of
 imprisonment to life with the possibility of parole. Flubacher
 did not appeal his conviction or sentence in any of the five
 cases.
 
On December 13, 2005, Flubacher filed a petition for
 
post-conviction relief pursuant to HRPP Rule 40 and the case was
 docketed as S.P.P. No. 05-1-0081. Circuit Court minutes indicate
 that the petition was denied on the day it was filed but no
 written order was entered denying the petition. 
On January 27, 2014, and on August 21, 2014, Flubacher
 
filed the instant Petition and Amended Petition. Flubacher
 stated four grounds for relief in the Amended Petition. On April
 2, 2015 the Circuit Court issued its Findings of Fact,
 Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying Petition to Vacate, Set
 Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner from Custody
 Without a Hearing which denied the Petition and Amended Petition. 
The Circuit Court did not err in denying Flubacher's
 
Petition and Amended Petition without a hearing. Flubacher is
 not entitled to direct application of Apprendi, Ring, or
 Cunningham because he did not appeal any of his convictions and
 thus they became final in 2003. Accordingly, the only mechanism
 by which Flubacher may challenge his sentences is a petition
 under HRPP Rule 40.
 
Flubacher appears to claim that Apprendi and Ring
 
should apply to his sentencing, but does not include Blakely and
 Booker because those cases were decided after his convictions
 became final. Flubacher asserts that his case is distinguishable
 from Loher. We disagree. In Loher, this court stated that we
 need not decide whether Cunningham was applicable because Loher's
 conviction was final on July 20, 2003, "long before the Supreme
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Court's decision in Blakely and Booker." Loher, 118 Hawai 'i at 
537-38, 193 P.3d at 453-54. Thus, this court then determined 
that it did not need to look further than Blakely and Booker, both of which do not apply retroactively on collateral review, because, Loher's sentence was finalized before both decisions. Id. Similarly, Flubacher's conviction was also finalized in 2003 
and, therefore, this court need not decide whether Cunningham was applicable. Thus, Flubacher's contention is without merit. 
Flubacher's contention that the Circuit Court 
erroneously considered the fact that he hit one of his victims with a hammer was waived. Haw. R. Penal P. 40(a)(3). Flubacher states that during his sentencing hearing on September 12, 2003, his counsel contested the claim that he hit a witness with a hammer. However, Flubacher did not appeal his conviction or sentence in 2003, has failed to present any facts to rebut the presumption that the failure to raise the issue was made knowingly, and does not prove the existence of the extraordinary circumstances to justify his failure to raise the issue. Haw. R. Penal P. 40(a)(3); Stanley v. State, 76 Hawai
'i 446, 451, 879 
P.2d 551, 556 (1994). 
Even if the argument was not waived, there is evidence 
in the record that Flubacher hit the victim with a hammer. On the Guilty Plea form in Cr. No. 01-1-2789 which was signed by Flubacher on June 12, 2003, it states, "On 12/4/01, in the City & County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, I kicked a woman in the face, hit 2 men with a hammer, and stabbed one man in the knee, causing serious bodily injuries to each. By force, I took the woman's purse and her father's car, all without permission." Furthermore, during Flubacher's sentencing hearing, a witness stated that Flubacher "hit me in the face with a hammer." In sum, there was evidence in the record to support the Circuit Court's statement that Flubacher hit the victim with a hammer. See Stanley, 76 Hawai
'i at 449, 879 P.2d at 554 (quoting State v. 
Allen, 7 Haw. App. 89, 92, 744 P.2d 789, 792 (1987) ("Where examination of the record of the trial court proceedings indicates that the petitioner's allegations shown no colorable claim, it is not error to deny the petition without a

hearing.")). 
Therefore, the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and
 
Order Denying Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment
 
or to Release Petitioner from Custody Without a Hearing, filed on
 April 2, 2015, in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is
 affirmed.
