CORIN S.N.M. GENTRY, fka CORIN S.N.M. GENTRY-BALDING,
Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
WILLIAM T. BALDING, IV, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-D NO. 13-1-7639)
 
ORDER GRANTING MAY 14, 2015 MOTION TO
DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) Plaintiff-Appellee Corin S.N.M. 
Gentry's (Appellee Gentry) May 14, 2015 motion to dismiss 
appellate court case number CAAP-15-0000365 for lack of appellate jurisdiction, and (2) the record, it appears that we do not have appellate jurisdiction over Defendant-Appellant William T. Balding, IV's (Appellant Balding) appeal from the Honorable Darryl Y.C. Choy's March 12, 2015 divorce decree, because Appellant Balding's appeal is untimely pursuant to Rule 4(a)(1) of the Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
The March 12, 2015 divorce decree was appealable
 
pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 571-54 (2006) and the
 
holding in Eaton v. Eaton, 7 Haw. App. 111, 118-19, 748 P.2d 801,
 805 (1987). However, Appellant Balding did not file his
 April 15, 2015 notice of appeal within thirty days after entry of
 the March 12, 2015 divorce decree, as HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) required. 
Therefore, Appellant Balding's appeal is untimely. The failure
 to file a timely notice of appeal in a civil matter is a
 jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot waive and the
 appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise of judicial
 discretion. Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127,
 
1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or justice is
 authorized to change the jurisdictional requirements contained in
 Rule 4 of these rules."); HRAP Rule 26(e) ("The reviewing court
 for good cause shown may relieve a party from a default
 occasioned by any failure to comply with these rules, except the
 failure to give timely notice of appeal."). Consequently, we
 lack appellate jurisdiction over appellate court case number
 CAAP-15-0000365. 
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellee
 
Gentry's May 14, 2015 motion to dismiss is granted, and appellate
 court case number CAAP-15-0000365 is dismissed.
