(Velazquez) appeals from the "Findings of Facts and Conclusions
 
of Law" (FOFs), entered on August 29, 2014 and the "Amended
 
Judgment and Notice of Entry of Amended Judgment," entered on
 
March 6, 2015 in the District Court of the Second Circuit1
 
(district court). Velazquez was convicted of operating a vehicle
 
under the influence of an intoxicant in violation of Hawaii
 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1), (4) (Supp. 2015).2

  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On appeal, Velazquez argues that the district court erred in
denying his motion to suppress evidence of his blood alcohol
 
content, which was obtained through a warrantless blood draw
 pursuant to HRS § 291E-21 (2007 Repl.).
 
 
HRS § 291E-21 is the mandatory testing provision
 
contained within Hawaii's implied consent statute. The implied
 consent statute governs the administration of breath, blood, and
 urine tests of vehicle operators suspected of driving under the
 influence of drugs or alcohol. See HRS § 291E-11 et seq. HRS
 
§ 291E-21 provides, in relevant part:

 
§291E-21 Applicable scope of part; mandatory testing
in the event of a collision resulting in injury or death.
 
. . . .
 
(c) In the event of a collision resulting in injury
or death and if a law enforcement officer has probable cause
to believe that a person involved in the collision has
committed a violation of section . . . 291E–61 . . . the 
law enforcement officer shall request that a sample of blood
or urine be recovered from the vehicle operator or any
other person suspected of committing a violation of
section . . . 291E-61[.]
 
The Hawai 'i Supreme Court in State v. Entrekin, 98 
Hawai'i 221, 47 P.3d 336 (2002) articulated the following 
standard for applying Hawaii's mandatory testing provision: 
[A] nonconsensual, warrantless blood extraction does not
violate the fourth amendment to the United States
 Constitution, whether the person has been arrested or not,
so long as (1) the police have probable cause to believe
that the person is [driving under the influence] and that
the blood sample will evidence that offense, (2) exigent
circumstances are present, and (3) the sample is obtained in
a reasonable manner.

intoxicant. (a) A person commits the offense of operating a

vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if the person
operates or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle:
 
(1) 	While under the influence of alcohol in an amount
 sufficient to impair the person's normal mental
faculties or ability to care for the person and guard
against casualty;
 
. . . .
 
(4) 	With .08 or more grams of alcohol per one
hundred milliliters or cubic centimeters of
 blood.

Id. at 232, 47 P.3d at 347 (emphasis added) (interpreting HRS

In general, exigent circumstances are present
 
when the demands of the occasion reasonably call for an
immediate police response. More specifically, it includes
situations presenting an immediate threatened removal or
destruction of evidence. However, the burden, of course, is
upon the government to prove the justification, and whether
the requisite conditions exists is to be measured from the
totality of the circumstances. And in seeking to meet this
burden, the police must be able to point to specific and
articulable facts from which it may be determined that the
action they took was necessitated by the exigencies of the
situation.
 
Id. at 232, 47 P.3d at 347 (emphasis added and ellipses omitted)
 
(quoting State v. Jenkins, 93 Hawai 'i 87, 102, 997 P.2d 13, 28 
(2000)). 
Velazquez contends the district court erred in finding
that exigent circumstances existed to justify the non-consensual,
 warrantless extraction of his blood sample. In its FOFs denying
 Velazquez's motion to suppress, the district court concluded that
 "[e]xigent circumstances exist to justify mandatory, non-
consensual blood extraction under HRS § 291E-21 because a
 person's blood alcohol level by its nature dissipates and is
 forever lost as time passes." The district court did not cite to
 any other factors that it may have considered to conclude that
 exigent circumstances existed to justify the warrantless blood
 draw. It appears that the district court believed, under the

 In State v. Yong Shik Won, 137 Hawai' i 330, 372 P.3d 1065 (2015),
the Hawai' i Supreme Court reaffirmed the standard articulated in Entrekin, 
noting:
 
A warrantless [blood alcohol content] test may be required
by police pursuant to HRS § 291E–21 from the operator of anyvehicle involved in a collision resulting in injury to orthe death of any person. Such a test does not offend theHawai'i Constitution "so long as (1) the police have
probable cause to believe that the person has committed a[driving under the influence] offense and that the bloodsample will evidence that offense, (2) exigent circumstancesare present, and (3) the sample is obtained in a reasonablemanner." [Entrekin, 98 Hawai' i at 232, 47 P.3d at 347]. In
Entrekin, "exigent circumstances were clearly present." Id. 
at 233, 47 P.3d at 348.

authority prescribed by HRS § 291E-21, the risk of alcohol
 
dissipation alone was enough to create an exigent circumstance. 
The United States Supreme Court in Missouri v. McNeely,
 
133 S.Ct. 1552 (2013), however, explicitly rejected such a
 conclusion and held that "in drunk-driving investigations, the
 natural dissipation of alcohol in the bloodstream does not
 constitute an exigency in every case sufficient to justify
 conducting a blood test without a warrant." Id. at 1568. 
Instead, the Supreme Court opted for a case-by-case assessment of
 exigency based on the totality of the circumstances. Id. at 1563
 
("Whether a warrantless blood test of a drunk-driving suspect is
 reasonable must be determined case by case based on the totality
 of the circumstances."). The McNeely court explained:
 
In those drunk-driving investigations where police officers
can reasonably obtain a warrant before a blood sample can be
drawn without significantly undermining the efficacy of the
search, the Fourth Amendment mandates that they do so. We do
not doubt that some circumstances will make obtaining a
warrant impractical such that the dissipation of alcohol
from the bloodstream will support an exigency justifying a
properly conducted warrantless blood test. That, however, is
a reason to decide each case on its facts, as we did in
Schmerber[v. California, 384 U.S. 757 (1966)], not to accept
the considerable overgeneralization that a per se rule would
reflect.
 
Id. at 1561 (internal citation, quotation marks, and emphasis
 
omitted).4
 
In support of its decision to reject a categorical
 
finding of exigency based on the risk of blood alcohol
 dissipation, the Supreme Court in McNeely maintained that "[t]he
 context of blood testing is different in critical respects from
 other destruction-of-evidence cases in which the police are truly
 confronted with a 'now or never' situation." McNeely, 133 S.Ct.
 
at 1561. In addition, the Supreme Court noted that a per se
 exigency rule "fails to account for advances in the 47 years
 since Schmerber was decided that allow for the more expeditious
 processing of warrant applications, particularly in contexts like

 We note "it is fundamental that, when interpreting our own
constitution, our divergence from federal interpretations of the United States
Constitution may not convey less protection than the federal standard." State
v. Fields, 115 Hawai' i 503, 517, 168 P.3d 955, 969 (2007); see State v.
Kaluna, 55 Haw. 361, 368, 520 P.2d 51, 58 (1974) ("In our interpretation ofthe United States Constitution, . . . [Hawai' i courts] are bound to follow
applicable pronouncements by the United States Supreme Court.").

drunk-driving investigations where the evidence offered to
 
establish probable cause is simple." Id. at 1561-62.
 
Specifically citing to Hawai 'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) 
5
Rule 41 (h)-(i),  which provides for a telephonic means of
obtaining a search warrant in Hawai
'i, the McNeely Court stated 
that "[w]ell over a majority of States allow police officers or
 prosecutors to apply for search warrants remotely through various
 means, including telephonic or radio communication, electronic
 communication, such as e-mail, and video conferencing." Id. at
 
1562. 
In the case before this court, the record does not
support a finding that, given the totality of the circumstances,

 
the police officers could not have reasonably obtained a search
 warrant before drawing Velazquez's blood sample. Because the
 district court only cited the risk of blood alcohol dissipation
 to support its finding of exigency and because the prosecution
 failed to adequately develop the record to demonstrate that the
 police officers were justified to act without a warrant, the

 HRPP Rule 41 provides, in relevant part:

 (c) Issuance and contents. A warrant shall issue only
on an affidavit or affidavits sworn to before the judge and
establishing the grounds for issuing the warrant. . . .
 
. . . .
 
(h) Warrant issuance on oral statements. In lieu of
 
the written affidavit required under section (c) of this
rule, a sworn oral statement, in person or by telephone, may
be received by the judge, which statement shall be recorded
and transcribed, and such sworn oral statement shall be
deemed to be an affidavit for the purposes of this rule.
Alternatively to receipt by the judge of the sworn oral
statement, such statement may be recorded by a court
reporter who shall transcribe the same and certify the
transcription. In either case, the recording and the
transcribed statement shall be filed with the clerk.
 
(i) Duplicate warrants on oral authorization. The
 
judge may orally authorize a police officer to sign the
signature of the judge on a duplicate original warrant,
which shall be deemed to be a valid search warrant for the
 purposes of this rule. The judge shall enter on the face of
the original warrant the exact time of issuance and shall
sign and file the original warrant and, upon its return, the
duplicate original warrant with the clerk.

district court clearly erred in holding that exigent 
circumstances existed to justify the warrantless extraction of Velazquez's blood sample. See State v. Lloyd, 61 Haw. 505, 512, 
606 P.2d 913, 918 (1980) ("[T]he question of exigency is addressed to the factfinding function of the trial court, and its findings in that regard will not be set aside unless determined to be clearly erroneous."). Consequently, the district court also erred in denying Velazquez's motion to suppress. See 
Entrekin, 98 Hawai
'i at 232, 47 P.3d at 347; see also Won, 137 
Hawai'i at 344 n.26, 372 P.3d at 1079 n.26. 
Therefore, the "Findings of Facts and Conclusions of
 
Law," entered on August 29, 2014 and the "Amended Judgment and
 Notice of Entry of Amended Judgment," entered on March 6, 2015 in
 the District Court of the Second Circuit are vacated and this
 case is remanded for a new trial consistent with this Opinion.
