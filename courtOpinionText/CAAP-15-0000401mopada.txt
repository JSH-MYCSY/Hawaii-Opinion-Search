APPEALS FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 09-1-0961 (2))

 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: 
Reifurth, Presiding Judge, Ginoza and Chan, JJ.)
 
In this consolidated appeal from a foreclosure action,
 
US Bank National Association, as Trustee for the Structured Asset
 
Securities Corporation Mortgage Loan Trust, 2006-NC1 (USBNA)
 
appeals from (1) the "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law,
 
Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure" (4/8/15 Judgment and Decree
of Foreclosure), filed on April 8, 2015, and (2) a "Judgment on
 
Order Denying in Part and Granting in Part Amended Plaintiff's
 
Motion to Reduce Bid to Total Debt Bid and For Confirmation of 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Sale by Commissioner" (9/28/15 Judgment  ), filed on September 28,
2015, in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (circuit
 
court).1
 
 
On appeal, USBNA contends that the circuit court erred
 
by (1) not awarding USBNA per diem interest after February 28,
 
2010, until the outstanding principal was paid, pursuant to the
 terms of the subject Note and Mortgage; and (2) limiting USBNA's
 award of attorney's fees and costs purportedly to those related
 to the filing of the complaint and an answer.
2
 
It appears the circuit court did not award USBNA its
 
full request for per diem interest or its full request for
 attorneys' fees and costs because of USBNA's delays in litigating
 the case. Although we conclude the circuit court could properly
 reduce USBNA's per diem interest and reasonable attorneys' fees
 and costs based on USBNA's delays in litigating the case, it does
 not appear that the actual awards were limited only in this
 regard. We therefore remand for further proceedings.
Background

 
USBNA filed the Complaint against DefendantsÂ­
Appellees/Cross-Appellants Daneford Michael Wright and Ellareen
 
1 The Honorable Peter T. Cahill presided except where otherwise
indicated.
2 This consolidated appeal involves four appeals. In CAAP-15-0000401,
USBNA appeals from the 4/8/15 Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure, and the
Wrights cross-appealed. In CAAP-15-0000578, USBNA again appealed from the
4/8/15 Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure after the circuit court denied the
Wrights' motion for reconsideration of the 4/8/15 Judgment and Decree of
Foreclosure. In CAAP-15-0000579, the Wrights appealed from the 4/8/15 Judgment
and Decree of Foreclosure. In CAAP-15-0000714, the Wrights appealed from,
inter alia, the 9/28/15 Judgment, and USBNA filed a cross-appeal.
On January 7, 2016, at the Wrights' request, the court consolidated
the four appeals, as well as the briefing for the appeals. Thereafter, the
Wrights were granted numerous extensions to file their opening brief, however,the Wrights failed to file their opening brief. The Wrights also defaulted infiling an answering brief to USBNA's opening brief, were thereafter granted anextension to file an answering brief, and then still failed to file ananswering brief. On October 11, 2016, this court granted USBNA's Motion toDismiss and ordered that the Wrights' appeal was dismissed pursuant to Hawai' i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 30. The court also ordered that no answering brief in the cross-appeal shall be filed. Subsequently, the Wrightsfiled an answering brief on October 24, 2016. On November 10, 2016, thiscourt entered an order striking the Wrights' answering brief. We thus address the issues raised in USBNA's opening brief in the consolidated appeal.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Uilani Wright (the Wrights) on December 23, 2009. On March 9,
 
2010, USBNA filed a summary judgment motion asserting that the
 
3
Wrights owed $780,713.61, "plus per diem interest accrual for
each day after February 28, 2010, until paid (currently $132.76
 per diem at 6.6% per current term)." USBNA claimed it was
 entitled to foreclosure and to sell the property. On December 8,
 2010, the circuit court held a hearing and orally granted USBNA's
 summary judgment motion.
4
 
Soon thereafter, on December 27, 2010, the Wrights
 
filed a notice in circuit court that they had filed for
 bankruptcy. Almost a year later, on December 19, 2011, USBNA
 filed a notice that the bankruptcy court had granted USBNA relief
 from the bankruptcy stay.
 
On January 10, 2012, the circuit court entered the
 
written order granting USBNA's summary judgment motion. This
 order concluded, inter alia, that $780,713.61 was due and payable
 on USBNA's Note and Mortgage, "plus per diem interest accrual for
 each day after February 28, 2010, until paid (currently $132.76
 per diem at 6.6% per current term[.])" Also on January 10, 2012,
 the circuit court filed a judgment of foreclosure in favor of
 USBNA (1/10/12 Judgment).
5
 
On September 21, 2012, the Wrights filed notice that
 
they had again filed for bankruptcy. On January 8, 2013, the
 bankruptcy court granted USBNA relief from the automatic
 bankruptcy stay.
 
A public auction of the property was held on January
 
25, 2013, with USBNA being the highest bidder with a bid of
 $900,000. On March 7, 2013, a Commissioner's Report was filed 
3 The $780,713.61 claimed by USBNA in its summary judgment motion
included $44,340.63 for per diem interest up to February 28, 2010.
 
4 The Honorable Shackley F. Raffetto presided.

 The Honorable Shackley F. Raffetto entered the January 10, 2012 order
and judgment.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
recommending confirmation of the sale, however an order
 
confirming the sale was not entered.
 
On May 29, 2014, over a year after the public auction
 
and Commissioner's Report, USBNA filed "Plaintiff's Motion for
 Ratification of Judgment Nunc Pro Tunc to Date of Judgment Filed
 on January 10, 2012 and Adjustment of Judgment Figures Pursuant
 to New Declaration of Indebtedness" (Motion to Ratify Judgment).
 
The motion sought to have the 1/10/12 Judgment "ratified as being
 
in compliance with the letter and spirit of Act 182 signed into
 law by Governor Abercrombie on June 28, 2012[.]" USBNA also
 stated, inter alia, that it reduced the late charges in the
 amounts owed as a result of a new policy, which decreased the
 overall indebtedness to USBNA. USBNA asserted that the total
 amount due from the Wrights was $779,646.81 "plus per diem
 interest accrual for each day after February 28, 2010, until paid
 (currently $132.76 per diem at 6.6% per current term)." 
On September 10, 2014, the circuit court held a hearing
 
regarding the Motion to Ratify Judgment. USBNA stated that it
 filed the Motion to Ratify Judgment because Wells Fargo, N.A.,
 the servicer of the loan, had to follow a national consent decree
 requiring it to review the declaration of indebtedness that
 supported the summary judgment motion. The circuit court ruled
 that USBNA's motion created a question of fact and thus vacated
 the 1/10/12 Judgment and further ruled the case would go to
 trial.
 
On December 9, 2014, the circuit court issued an order
 
vacating the 1/10/12 Judgment. 
After a jury-waived trial, the circuit court orally
 
ruled that (1) USBNA established by a preponderance of the
 evidence that foreclosure should be granted and USBNA was owed
 $779,646.89. The circuit court denied, however, USBNA's request
 for per diem interest of $132.76 per day after February 28, 2010.
 The circuit court determined that because of USBNA's delay in
 resolving the case, such interest was not warranted for the
 period sought.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On April 8, 2015, the circuit court filed the 4/8/15
 
Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure, which includes Conclusion of
 
Law (COL) 9, denying USBNA's request for per diem interest after
 
February 28, 2010.
 
On June 5, 2015, a Commissioner's Report was filed
 
stating, inter alia, that a public auction was held on June 2,
 
2015, and USBNA was the highest bidder with a credit bid of
 $853,068.82.
 
On July 10, 2015, USBNA filed an "Amended Plaintiff's
 
Motion to Reduce Bid to Total Debt Bid and for Confirmation of
 Sale By Commissioner" (Motion to Reduce Bid). USBNA stated that
 
the bid price of $853,068.82 included its attorneys' fees and
 
costs. USBNA requested that the circuit court reduce USBNA's bid
 price of $853,068.82 to $779,646.81, or in the alternative allow
 the bid to remain and grant USBNA's legal fees and costs of
 $67,407.79.
 
On September 2, 2015, the circuit court filed an order
 
regarding the Motion to Reduce Bid which, inter alia, awarded
 USBNA $1,845.00 in attorney's fees and $1,442.55 in costs. A
 further judgment was entered on September 28, 2015.
Per Diem Interest After February 28, 2010
 
USBNA challenges COL 9 in the 4/8/15 Judgment and
 
Decree of Foreclosure contending that the circuit court erred
 when it did not award per diem interest after February 28, 2010,
 until the outstanding principal was paid. USBNA contends that
 the denial of the per diem interest is contrary to the express
 terms of the Note and Mortgage.
 
The circuit court indicated that it would not award
 
interest after February 28, 2010 because the case was not pursued
 in a timely fashion, particularly because USBNA had not gone
 forward with the original commissioner's sale. In this regard,
 the circuit court indicated it would be unfair to allow further
 per diem interest "when this matter should have been resolved in
 2010[.]"

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"As a general rule, the construction and legal effect 
to be given a contract is a question of law freely reviewable by 
an appellate court." Brown v. KFC Nat'l Mgmt. Co., 82 Hawai 'i 
226, 239, 921 P.2d 146, 159 (1996). Further, "[i]t is fundamental that terms of a contract should be interpreted according to their plain, ordinary and accepted use in common speech, unless the contract indicates a different meaning." Id. 
at 240, 921 P.2d at 160 (citation and brackets omitted). 
Both the Note and Mortgage were admitted as evidence at
 
trial. With regard to interest, the Note provides:
 
Interest will be charged on unpaid principal until the
full amount of Principal has been paid
. I will pay interest
at a yearly rate of 6.600%.
The interest rate required by this Section 2 is the
rate I will pay both before and after any default  described
in Section 6(B) of this Note. 
(Emphasis added.) Thus, under the plain language of the Note,
 the Wrights agreed to pay interest on the loan and the Note
 provides that the interest would accrue both before and after
 default.
 
As noted by USBNA, "foreclosure is an equitable action
 
and the function of the foreclosure court is to ascertain the
 precise amount due under the mortgage." Honolulu, Ltd. v.
 
Blackwell, 7 Haw. App. 210, 219, 750 P.2d 942, 948 (1988)
 (citations omitted). However, "[c]ourts of equity have the power
 to mold their decrees to conserve the equities of the parties
 under the circumstances of the case." Id. (citation omitted). 
In addition, "[i]n contract or in tort, the plaintiff has a duty
 to make every reasonable effort to mitigate his damages." First
 
United Funding, LLC v. Naupaka Invs., L.L.C., Nos. CAAP-12Â­0000365, CAAP-12-0000527, 2015 WL 4067188, at *5 (Haw. App. June
 30, 2015) (quoting Malani v. Clapp, 56 Haw. 507, 517, 542 P.2d
 1265, 1271 (1975)).
 
In this case, it is not clear by what date the
 
principal amount should have been paid, if not for USBNA's delay
 in pursuing the litigation, nor did the circuit court make a
 finding in this regard. Rather, the circuit court awarded per
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
diem interest only as calculated up to February 28, 2010, which
 
was done for purposes of USBNA's summary judgment motion filed on
 March 9, 2010. However, even without delay by USBNA, there would
 have reasonably been an additional period after the summary
 judgment ruling before the principal amount owing would have been
 paid. For instance, the initial auction and confirmation of sale
 process still needed to occur before the outstanding principal
 was paid. Further, the two bankruptcy filings by the Wrights
 caused delay after summary judgment was granted to USBNA, and
 those delays should not be counted against USBNA.
6
 
With regard to the delays attributable to USBNA,
 
however, the circuit court had equitable discretion whether to
 award the per diem interest. In this regard, it appears that
 after the public auction on January 25, 2013, an order confirming
 the sale was not pursued by USBNA. Instead, the Motion to Ratify
 Judgment was filed over a year after the first public auction,
 which then led the circuit court to vacate the 1/10/12 Judgment
 and require a trial.
 
Thus, we conclude USBNA is entitled to per diem
 
interest after February 28, 2010 for the reasonable amount of
 time it should have taken USBNA to obtain payment of the
 outstanding principal. On remand, the circuit court should make
 a finding of when USBNA would have likely obtained payment of the
 outstanding principal, if not for its delay in litigating the
 case, and award the additional per diem interest up to that
 point.
 
We further conclude that the circuit court has
 
equitable discretion not to award USBNA per diem interest for the
 period after USBNA reasonably should have obtained payment of the
 outstanding principal, if not for its delay in litigating the
 case. See Akamine & Sons, Ltd. v. Hawaii Nat'l Bank, Honolulu,
 
54 Haw. 107, 113-14, 507 P.2d 424, 428-29 (1972) (stating that it
 
6 We note, though, that the circuit court may properly consider whether
USBNA sought to lift the bankruptcy stays within a reasonable time.
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
would be unfair to require the defendants to pay interest during
 
the time period that the banks forestalled the payments of the
 debts).
 
We therefore vacate the award as to per diem interest
 
and remand for further proceedings.
Attorney's Fees
 
USBNA contends that the circuit court erred when it 
limited USBNA's award of attorney's fees and costs to only those related to the complaint and answer. USBNA contends that under the Note, Mortgage, and Hawai
'i law, USBNA was entitled to 
reasonable attorney's fees. 
The circuit court stated that it would only award
 
attorney's fees related to the filing of the complaint and answer
 because the fees that were requested were a result of the way
 USBNA handled the matter. Thus, the circuit court awarded
 $1,845.00 in attorney's fees and $1,442.55 in costs.
 
In this case, the Note provides:
 
If the Note Holder has required me to pay immediately
in full as described above, the Note Holder will have the
right to be paid back by me for all of its costs and
expenses in enforcing this Note to the extent not prohibited
by applicable law. Those expenses included, for example,
reasonable attorneys' fees.
 
(Emphasis added.) Further, HRS Â§ 607-14 (2016) provides in
 
pertinent part:
 
In all the courts, in all actions in the nature of assumpsit
and in all actions on a promissory note or other contract in
writing that provides for an attorney's fee, there shall be
taxed as attorneys' fees, to be paid by the losing party and
to be included in the sum for which execution may issue, a
fee that the court determines to be reasonable; provided
that the attorney representing the prevailing party shall
submit to the court an affidavit stating the amount of time
the attorney spent on the action and the amount of time the
attorney is likely to spend to obtain a final written
judgment . . . . The court shall then tax attorneys' fees,
which the court determines to be reasonable, to be paid by
the losing party[.]
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
In a case where attorney's fees are provided for by
 
contract, it is in the discretion of the circuit court to
 
determine the reasonableness of attorney's fees. Sharp v. Hui
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Wahine, Inc., 49 Haw. 241, 244, 413 P.2d 242, 245 (1966). This
 
court will not disturb the circuit court's determination of
 attorney's fees absent an abuse of discretion. Id.
 
In its Motion to Reduce Bid, USBNA requested attorneys'
 
fees and costs in the amount of $67,407.79, which consists of
 fees and costs incurred by its counsel Reginald K.T. Yee (Yee)
 
and Robert M. Ehrhorn, Jr. (Ehrhorn). In Yee's declaration, he
 
requested attorney's fees in the amount of $54,133.49 and costs
 
in the amount of $3,040.60. The hours billed by Yee all occurred
 after the Motion to Ratify Judgment. However, Yee's declaration
 does not include dates for when the costs were incurred. Given
 this record, Yee's declaration demonstrates that the circuit
 court did not abuse its discretion in denying Yee's attorney's
 fees. However, it is unclear whether Yee's requested costs were
 reasonably incurred outside of USBNA's delay in litigating.
 
Ehrhorn's declaration states his fees are "in
 
connection with the uncontested part of the foreclosure
 proceeding," and requests fees totaling $3,497.38, which includes
 flat fees for, inter alia, the title claim, reviewing the debt
 dispute from the Wrights, preparing and filing the Complaint,
 serving the Complaint, preparing and filing the summary judgment
 motion, preparing a response to another defendant's counterclaim,
 and preparing for the auction. Ehrhorn also requested costs in
 the amount of $6,686.32 for filing the complaint, a litigation
 guarantee, recording fees, title endorsement, postage, court fee,
 transcript fee, travel expenses, commissioner's fees and costs,
 and sheriff's fees.
 
Although the circuit court stated that it was awarding
 
attorneys' fees and costs associated only with the filing of the
 complaint and an answer (apparently an answer to a counterclaim),
 it appears the court awarded fees and costs beyond those filings,
 but less than the amount requested. The fee award of $1,845.00
 covers more than the fees identified in Ehrhorn's declaration for
 the complaint and responding to a counterclaim, which only
 amounted to $370.00 and $450.00, respectively. Further, the
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
award of $1,442.55 in costs appears to cover the costs in
 
Ehrhorn's declaration, except for commissioner's fees/costs and
 sheriff's fees. However, given Ehrhorn's declaration and without
 specifics as to what was actually awarded, it appears that the
 circuit court may not have awarded all of Ehrhorn's fees and
 costs reasonably incurred and not resulting from delayed
 litigation.
 
Thus, similar to our ruling as to the per diem

 
interest, the circuit court should determine whether Yee's costs,
 and Ehrhorn's fees and costs, were reasonably incurred and not
 due to USBNA's delay in litigating. Therefore, we vacate the
 award as to USBNA's attorney's fees and costs, and remand for
 further proceedings.
 
Conclusion
 
Given the above, we vacate the awards related to per
 
diem interest, and USBNA's attorney's fees and costs, entered by
 the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit. The case is remanded
 for further proceedings on these issues consistent with this
 opinion.
