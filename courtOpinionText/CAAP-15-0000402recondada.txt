(NORTH & SOUTH KONA DIVISION)
(CASE NO. 3DTA-11-02996)
 
ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Defendant-Appellant's Motion for
Reconsideration filed on June 6, 2016 (
Motion), and the records
 
and files in this case, we conclude we did not overlook or
 
misapprehend any points of law or fact when we entered the May
 25, 2016 Summary Disposition Order herein.
 
 
Defendant-Appellant Rachel Viamoana Ui (Ui) contends
that, based on State v. Won , No. SCWC-12-0000858, 2015 WL

entitled to relief from her April 13, 2012 conviction for
 
Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant, in
 violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 291E-61(a) (Supp. 2015),
 because her appeal was not final when the Won decision was
 promulgated.
 
However, unlike the defendant in Won, Ui did not move 
to suppress the results of her blood alcohol test. At trial, Ui testified that she drank four bottles of Budweiser, four to five mixed shots of alcohol, and swigs of rum prior to the accident. The parties stipulated that Ui's blood alcohol level was 0.156 grams of alcohol per one hundred millimeters or cubic centimeters of blood. Ui did not challenge the blood test draw or results. Rather, defense counsel argued that the State failed to prove that Ui was the operator of the vehicle. Ui is not entitled to relief based on Won because she is not similarly situated to the defendant in Won in that she failed to file a motion to suppress or otherwise assert to the district court that evidence of her blood test should be suppressed. Motions to suppress must be brought before trial or else the argument is waived. See Hawai

constitutional principle that the threat of criminal
sanctions inherently precludes a finding of voluntariness in
the context of the consent exception to the warrant
requirement. As such, this decision applies only to this
case and to all cases pending on direct appeal or not yet
final at the time that this decision is rendered. By final,
we mean those cases in which the judgment of conviction has
been rendered and the availability of appeal and certiorari
has elapsed.
