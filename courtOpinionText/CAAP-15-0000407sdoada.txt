SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
These two appeals have been consolidated by the court. 
In CAAP-15-0000407, Defendant-Appellant Akepa Properties LLC
 
(Akepa Properties) appeals from an "Order Denying Defendant Akepa
 
Properties LLC's Rule 60(b) Motion for Relief From Judgment and
 
for Evidentiary Hearing" (Order Denying Rule 60(b) Motion), filed
 
on April 14, 2015, by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
 
1
(circuit court).  In CAAP-15-0000727, Akepa Properties appeals
 
from an "Order Approving Commissioner's Report, Confirming
 
Commissioner's Sale of Property at Public Auction, Directing
 Distribution of Proceeds, and for a Writ of Possession" (Order
 
Confirming Sale), a "Judgment on [Order Confirming Sale]"
 
(Judgment Confirming Sale), and a "Writ of Possession," all
 
entered on September 9, 2015, by the circuit court, in favor of
 
Plaintiff-Appellee Nationstar Mortgage LLC (Nationstar).
 
On appeal, Akepa Properties contends the circuit court

 
erred by: (1) effectively holding that Nationstar did not need to
 prove its standing to foreclose on the subject property; (2)
 denying Akepa Properties' Motion for Relief from Judgment under
 
2
Rule 60(b) of the Hawai 'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP);  and
(3)
 granting Nationstar's Motion for Confirmation of Sale,
 
because material issues of fact remained for trial regarding
 Nationstar's standing.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
1 The Honorable Bert I. Ayabe presided.
 
2 HRCP Rule 60(b) provides, in pertinent part:
 
Rule 60. RELIEF FROM JUDGMENT OR ORDER.
 
. . . .
 
(b) Mistakes; Inadvertence; Excusable Neglect; Newly
Discovered Evidence; Fraud, etc. On motion and upon such
terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or a
party's legal representative from a final judgment, order,
or proceeding for the following reasons: . . . (3) fraud . .
., misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse
party; (4) the judgment is void; . . . .
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve the
 appeals by Akepa Properties as follows and affirm.
 
On May 6, 2014, the circuit court granted Nationstar's
 
motion for summary judgment seeking a decree of foreclosure and
 also entered a Judgment on the decree of foreclosure (Foreclosure
 
Judgment). Akepa Properties never appealed from the Foreclosure
 
Judgment. Instead, on July 22, 2014, Akepa Properties filed its
 
"Rule 60(b) Motion for Relief From Judgment and for Evidentiary
 Hearing" (Rule 60(b) Motion), arguing that there were numerous
 
flaws in the assignment of the subject mortgage and that
 
Nationstar did not have standing because it did not own the
 subject note. In terms of the provisions under HRCP Rule 60(b),
 Akepa's motion asserted primarily that there had been fraud
 warranting relief under HRCP Rule 60(b)(3), including fraud in
 the chain of title. The circuit court subsequently issued its
 Order Denying Rule 60(b) Motion, which Akepa Properties then
 appealed.
 
In the confirmation of sale proceedings, held after the
 
Foreclosure Judgment, Akepa Properties continued to challenge
 Nationstar's standing to foreclose. Similarly, in its appeal
 from the circuit court's Judgment Confirming Sale, Akepa
 Properties continues to assert the standing issue.
 
In Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. v. 
Wise, a foreclosure action, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court held that 
the defendants-mortgagors' failure to appeal from the foreclosure judgment in that case "barred challenges to [the foreclosing plaintiff's] standing under the doctrine of res judicata." 130 Hawai
'i 11, 12, 304 P.3d 1192, 1193 (2013). There, the court 
reasoned that: 
foreclosure cases are bifurcated into two separately
appealable parts: (1) the decree of foreclosure and the
order of sale, if the order of sale is incorporated within
the decree, and (2) all other orders. It is evident that
 orders confirming sale are separately appealable from the
decree of foreclosure, and therefore fall within the second
part of the bifurcated proceedings.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Id. at 16, 304 P.3d at 1197 (citations and internal quotation
 
marks omitted). Because the defendants in Wise never challenged
 the foreclosure judgment, it became final and binding. Id. 
 at
 
17, 304 P.3d at 1198. The supreme court further explained:
 
we conclude that res judicata would preclude Petitioners
from challenging Respondent's standing in their appeal from
the order confirming sale, despite the general proposition
that a lack of standing may be raised at any time. Under the
doctrine of res judicata, challenges to Respondent's
standing were subsumed under the foreclosure judgment, which
had became final and binding.
 
Id. (emphasis added). Wise is directly on point with regard to
 
Akepa Properties' appeal from the Order Confirming Sale, such
 
that Akepa Properties could not "again raise the standing
 objection previously asserted in the foreclosure proceeding in
 the subsequent confirmation of sale proceedings." Id. at 19, 304
 
P.3d at 1200. 
Moreover, Akepa Properties' Rule 60(b) Motion also
 
could not be used to further assert or resurrect its standing
 arguments. "It has been stated that a motion under Rule 60(b) is
 not a substitute for a timely appeal from the original judgment." 
Stafford v. Dickison, 46 Haw. 52, 57 n.4, 374 P.2d 665, 669 n.4
 (1962); see also In re Hana Ranch Co., 3 Haw. App. 141, 147, 642
 P.2d 938, 942 (1982)("[I]t ordinarily is not permissible to use
 [a 60(b)(6)] motion to remedy a failure to take an
 appeal.")(quoting Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and
 Procedure: Civil § 2864 (1973)).
 
In its appellate briefs, Akepa Properties makes little
 
effort to address the requirements under Rule 60(b), but instead
 argues as if it had appealed from the Foreclosure Judgment. At
 most, Akepa Properties makes passing reference only to Rule
 60(b)(4) in its reply briefs (whereas below it relied primarily
 on Rule 60(b)(3)). Thus, it appears Akepa Properties has waived
 any issues under HRCP Rule 60(b)(4). In any event, it does not
 appear that a challenge based on Rule 60(b)(4) would change the
 outcome.

The Hawai 'i Supreme Court recently held that, in a 
foreclosure action, the foreclosing plaintiff must establish its 
standing at the commencement of the case. Bank of America, N.A. 
v. Reyes-Toledo, ___ Hawai 'i ___, ___ P.3d ___, No. SCWC-15­
0000005, Slip op. at *5 (Haw. Feb. 28, 2017). Nonetheless, lack of standing does not render a court's ruling void under HRCP Rule 60(b)(4). "In the sound interest of finality, the concept of a void judgment must be narrowly restricted." Cvitanovich-Dubie v. 
Dubie, 125 Hawai
'i 128, 141, 254 P.3d 439, 452 (2011)(citations 
omitted). As multiple Hawai 'i cases have recognized, "[i]t has 
been noted that a judgment is void only if the court that rendered it lacked jurisdiction of either the subject matter or the parties or otherwise acted in a manner inconsistent with due process of law." Id. at 139, 254 P.3d at 450 (emphasis 
added)(quoting In re Hana Ranch Co., 3 Haw. App. at 146, 642 P.2d at 941); see also Dillingham Inv. Corp. v. Kunio Yokoyama Tr., 8 Haw. App. 226, 233-34, 797 P.2d 1316, 1320 (1990)("[I]f a court has the general power to adjudicate the issues in the class of suits to which the case belongs then its interim orders and final judgments, whether right or wrong, are not subject to collateral attack, so far as jurisdiction over the subject matter is concerned.") (citation omitted). 
Here, there is no challenge based on personal 
jurisdiction, and an argument that a party lacks standing is not equivalent to challenging a court's subject matter jurisdiction. Rather, this foreclosure action is "'in the class of suits' that the [circuit] court 'has the general power to adjudicate.'" Cvitanovich-Dubie, 125 Hawai
'i at 142, 254 P.3d at 453; see also 
Bank of Am., N.A. v. Kuchta, 21 N.E.3d 1040, 1045-47 (Ohio 2014) (discussing the differences between lack of standing and subject matter jurisdiction, and holding in a foreclosure case that the defendant was barred by res judicata from asserting an issue of 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
standing in a rule 60(b) motion). In sum, the circuit court
 
properly denied Akepa Properties' Rule 60(b) Motion.3
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Order Denying
 
Defendant Akepa Properties LLC's Rule 60(b) Motion for Relief
 From Judgment and for Evidentiary Hearing," filed on April 14,
 2015, and the "Judgment on Order Approving Commissioner's Report,
 Confirming Commissioner's Sale of Property at Public Auction,
 Directing Distribution of Proceeds, and for a Writ of
 Possession," filed on September 9, 2015, both entered by the
 Circuit Court of the First Circuit, are affirmed.

 This court reached a similar conclusion recently in Bank of America,

Mar. 31, 2017)(SDO)(holding that when the foreclosure defendant's argument
based on standing was barred by res judicata, the defendant could not seek
relief under HRCP Rule 60(b)).
