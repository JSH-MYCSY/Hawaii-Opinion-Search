NO. CAAP-15-0000408
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
GERALD MANULEI VILLANUEVA, Petitioner-Appellant,
v.
 
STATE OF HAWAI'I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P. NO. 14-1-0003(2) (CR. NO. 96-0078(2)))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Gerald Villanueva (Villanueva) 
appeals from the "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and 
Judgment Denying Petitioner's Non-Conforming [Hawai 'i Rules of 
Penal Procedure (HRPP)] Rule 40 Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner From Custody" (Order Denying Petition). The Order Denying Petition was filed by the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (Circuit Court) on April 17, 2015.
1 Although Villanueva's precise arguments on appeal are 
difficult to decipher, it appears he claims that the Hawai 'i 
Paroling Authority (HPA) improperly increased his maximum term of imprisonment and that the Circuit Court erred in failing to grant him relief on this claim. We conclude that Villanueva's appeal is without merit, and we affirm the Order Denying Petition.

I.
 
The underlying criminal proceeding relevant to this 
appeal is Cr. No. 96-0078(2). In that case, Villanueva was 
convicted of first-degree robbery (Count 1); carrying or use of a firearm in the commission of a separate felony (Count 2); and possession of a prohibited firearm (Count 3). On October 23, 1996, Villanueva was sentenced to concurrent terms of twenty years of imprisonment on Count 1, twenty years of imprisonment on Count 2, and five years of imprisonment on Count 3. On May 28, 1998, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court issued a Summary Disposition 
Order which affirmed Villanueva's convictions and sentences on Counts 1 and 3, but reversed his conviction and sentence on Count 2. Despite the supreme court's decision, the Circuit Court did
 not file an amended judgement reflecting the supreme court's
 reversal of Count 2 until 2010. On December 7, 2010, the Circuit
 Court filed an amended judgment which omitted Count 2 and
 reimposed the same sentences on Counts 1 and 3 that the supreme
 court had affirmed in 1998.
 
In the meantime, on January 10, 1997, the HPA set

 
Villanueva's minimum term of imprisonment at five years for Count
 1, five years for Count 2, and three years for Count 3. On April
 
3, 2001, Villanueva escaped from custody, and he was returned to
 
custody on April 9, 2001. On July 3, 2003, Villanueva was
 released on a parole to Victory Ohana. On January 12, 2004,
 Villanueva left Victory Ohana without authorization. He failed
 to return to Victory Ohana or report to his parole officer the
 next day, and HPA issued a warrant for his arrest on January 16,
 2004. Villanueva was returned to custody on April 1, 2005, and
 after a hearing on July 6, 2005, Villanueva's parole was revoked. 
The HPA's order revoking parole notified Villanueva that his
 maximum term for Cr. No. 96-0078(2) had been extended to July 26,
 2017.
 
On June 22, 2010, Villanueva was again released on
 
parole. After May 16, 2012, Villanueva failed to report to and
 maintain contact with his parole officer, and on November 18,

2012, the HPA issued a warrant for his arrest. Villanueva was
 
returned to custody on March 3, 2013. After a hearing on April
 12, 2013, Villanueva's parole was revoked. The order revoking
 Villanueva's parole notified him that his maximum term for Cr.
 No. 96-0078(2) had been extended to May 17, 2018, and that a
 hearing for parole consideration would be scheduled for March
 2015. By letter dated April 29, 2013, the HPA explained that
 Villanueva had absconded from parole and remained a fugitive for
 446 days during his first parole and for 290 days during his
 second parole. The HPA stated that as a result, it had adjusted
 the expiration of his maximum term, which "now expires on May 17,
 2018, instead of the original date of May 5, 2016."

II.
 
Villanueva's central argument on appeal is that the HPA
 
improperly increased his maximum term of imprisonment which was
 originally scheduled to expire in May 2016. He contends that the
 HPA improperly added two more years beyond the twenty-year term
 imposed by the sentencing judge. Villanueva's claim is without
 merit.
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 353-66(c) (2015)
 
authorizes the HPA to exclude the time that a paroled prisoner
 absconds from parole and remains a fugitive in determining when
 the prisoner's maximum term of imprisonment will expire. HRS 
§ 353-66(c) provides:
 
(c) If any paroled prisoner leaves the State without
permission from the paroling authority, or if the
whereabouts of any paroled prisoner is not known to the
paroling authority because of the neglect or failure of the
prisoner to so inform it, the paroling authority may order
the parole suspended pending apprehension. From and after
 the suspension of the parole of any paroled prisoner and
until the paroled prisoner's return to custody, the paroled
prisoner shall be deemed an escapee and a fugitive from
justice, and no part of the time during which the paroled
prisoner is an escapee and a fugitive from justice shall be
part of the paroled prisoner's term.
 
2The HPA's adjustment of the expiration of Villanueva's maximum term
also apparently took into account his brief escape from custody in 2001. The
 HPA subsequently recalculated Villanueva's maximum sentence expiration date
and adjusted it from May 17, 2018, to May 16, 2018.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(Emphases added.) Villanueva does not dispute that he absconded
 
from parole and remained a fugitive during both times that he was
 released on parole. Pursuant to HRS § 353-66(c), the HPA was
 entitled to exclude the time Villanueva absconded from parole and
 remained a fugitive in determining when his maximum term of
 imprisonment will expire on the twenty-year term of imprisonment
 imposed on his first-degree robbery conviction in Cr. No. 96­0078(2).
3 Accordingly, the Circuit Court was correct in
 
rejecting Villanueva's claim that the HPA had improperly extended
 his maximum term of imprisonment.
 
Villanueva appears to argue that the Circuit Court's
 
delay in issuing an amended judgment after the supreme court's
 1998 decision reversing his conviction and sentence on Count 2
 somehow entitles him to immediate release from custody. 
Villanueva, however, received concurrent twenty-year terms of
 imprisonment on both Count 1 and Count 2. The delay in issuing
 the amended judgment did not affect his conviction or twenty-year
 term of imprisonment on Count 1, which the supreme court affirmed
 in its 1998 decision, and his maximum term on Count 1 has not
 expired.
 
Villanueva also cites the supreme court's reference to
 
his conviction on Court 2 as being for "[p]ossession" or use of a
 firearm in the commission of a separate felony instead of for
 "carrying" or use of a firearm in the commission of a separate
 felony in its 1998 decision. However, it is clear from the
 decision that the supreme court was referring to Villanueva's
 conviction on Count 2 for violating HRS § 134-6(a). The supreme
 court's use the term "possession" rather than "carrying" in
 describing the offense charged in Count 2 is inconsequential and
 does not provide Villanueva with any basis for relief.
 
3There appears to be no dispute that the HPA was entitled to exclude the
time that Villanueva had escaped from custody in 2001 in determining the
expiration of his maximum term.
