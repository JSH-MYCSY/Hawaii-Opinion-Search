OPINION OF THE COURT BY LEONARD, J.
Minor-Appellant CM appeals from the May 1, 2015
Findings of Fact [( FOFs)], Conclusions of Law [( COLs)], Decision
and Order ( Order Denying Reconsideration ) entered by the Family
Court of the Fifth Circuit (Family Court ).1  CM also challenges
the Family Court's April 2, 2015 Amended Modified Order Revoking
Probation and Resentencing (Amended Modified Order ), whichFOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2ordered the payment of restitution to the victim of CM's law
violation, as well as the Family Court's previous orders for
restitution, which were entered on March 2 and 16, 2015.
As set forth herein, we hold:  (1) the Family Court did
not err in concluding that family courts, like criminal courts,
need not sort out insurance indemnities, subrogation rights,
and/or other potential civil law implications before ordering a
minor law violator to repay his or her victim under the family
court restitution statute; (2) as the Family Court recognized,
the family court restitution statute is permissive or
discretionary and does not mandate an order for restitution in
every case in which restitution is requested; (3) the Family
Court erred, however, in relying strictly on adult criminal
restitution cases and principles, rather than considering the
greater flexibility provided in the family court restitution
statute, which authorizes a family court to order a minor law
violator to make restitution by way of services to the victim, or
to render community services instead, and which does not
specifically require reimbursement of the "full amount" of the
victim's loss; and (4) the Family Court erred in ordering monthly
restitution payments of $300.00 because (a) the Family Court
failed to consider CM's ability to make restitution payments for
the purpose of establishing the time and manner of payment and
(b) the Family Court issued various restitution orders in varying
amounts, without notice, an opportunity to be heard, or an
explanation as to why its decision changed.  We vacate and
remand.FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2HRS § 707-710(1) (2014) states:
§ 707-710  Assault in the first degree.  (1)  A person
commits the offense of assault in the first degree if the
person intentionally or knowingly causes serious bodily
injury to another person.
3I.BACKGROUND FACTS
On January 29, 2014, Plaintiff-Appellee State of
Hawai#i (the State) filed a Petition charging CM with certain law
violations, pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 571-11(1)
(2006).  In relevant part, the Petition alleged:
COUNT 3 :  On or about November 2, 2013, in the County
of Kaua# i, State of Hawai# i, [CM] did intentionally or
knowingly cause serious bodily injury to [a minor victim
(MV)] thereby committing the offense of Assault in the First
2Degree in violation of [HRS] Section 707-710(1).  
The Family Court's unchallenged Findings of Fact ( FOFs)
include that CM intentionally shot a pellet gun at MV's face. 
The pellet entered and exited MV's eye, lodging itself in MV's
facial skin, leaving fragments and pieces in the eye, with a loss
of vision.  MV's resulting medical bills were evidenced to be
$23,434.85.  MV's medical bills were paid in full by Med-QUEST,
which provided medical insurance to MV's family.  CM was thirteen
years old at the time of the shooting incident.
At a November 10, 2014 adjudication hearing, CM entered
into a plea agreement with the State.  CM admitted to the Assault
in the First Degree and the State dismissed the remaining counts. 
There was no other agreement as to the disposition.  When the
court inquired about restitution, CM's counsel stated there was
no agreement as far as restitution, but noted that the Deputy
Prosecuting Attorney (DPA ) "is trying to verify and will provide
me the documentation regarding . . . that issue."  In conjunctionFOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
4with the plea colloquy, inter alia , the court explained and CM
acknowledged that CM could be ordered to pay restitution.  
The Family Court adjudged CM a law violator as to Count
3, Assault in the First Degree.  The Family Court ordered an
updated social study and revoked CM's probation.  The Updated
Social History Report, which was filed in the Family Court on
January 5, 2015, reported that MV's mother "stated her husband
would be submitting medical bills to request restitution."  
In addition, at the January 5, 2015 disposition
hearing, the DPA asked the Family Court "to continue this matter
for a restitution hearing."  The DPA stated that the victim's
family "were going to get all of the medical records together and
submit it."  The DPA further stated, "[s]o when I spoke to the
family, they were, yes, wanting to have restitution awarded to
them."  The DPA argued to the Family Court, "I think the status
of the law is that if there are medical bills, then the minor and
or the minor's family should be responsible for those medical
bills.  And I'll be the first to say, when I spoke with the
family, most of their expenses were covered by Quest.  But I
don't think that would make any difference."  On January 5, 2015,
the Family Court filed an order revoking the probation period set
in conjunction with a prior petition, resentencing CM to an
extended period of probation, and setting various conditions to
the probation.
On March 2, 2015, the Family Court held a further
hearing, including a hearing on restitution.  CM's counsel
stipulated to the entry of MV's medical records, stating that heFOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
3The Modified Order was signed by the presiding judge on Friday,
March 13, 2015, and then entered on Monday, March 16, 2015.  It does not
appear from the record on appeal that there was a further hearing or any
submission from the parties prior to the entry of the Modified Order on March
16, 2015.  A brief hearing was held later in the day on March 16, 2015, but
restitution was not discussed.
5had no objections to admitting the records into evidence.  The
requested amount of restitution, $23,434.85, was supported by the
documents admitted into evidence.  There was no challenge to the
reasonableness of the services, but the defense questioned
whether the full amount should be awarded because both CM and
MV's families had Quest insurance.  CM argued that, in effect,
his insurance carrier already paid for all of the medical
services.  CM further argued that this case is distinguishable
from State v. Tuialii, 121 Hawai# i 135, 214 P.3d 1125 (App.
2009), because the nature of the crime did not benefit or enrich
CM in any way.  
After the hearing, on March 2, 2015, the Family Court
entered an "Amended Order Revoking Probation and Resentencing,"
which ordered restitution to MV in the amount of $23,434.85, to
be paid in monthly installments of no less than $200.00.  The
order further provided that, in the absence of payment by CM,
CM's parents pay restitution to MV in the amount of $23,434.85,
in monthly installments of no less than $200.00.
On March 16, 2015, the Family Court entered a "Modified
Order Revoking Probation and Resentencing" ( Modified Order ).3 
With respect to restitution, the Modified Order (1) decreased the
total amount of restitution that CM is required to pay from
$23,434.85 to $6,884.04, and (2) increased the monthlyFOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
4The Motion for Reconsideration did not seek any modification of
the requirement that, in the absence of payment by CM, CM's parents pay the
restitution to MV.
5It does not appear from the record on appeal that there was a
further hearing or any submission from the parties prior to the entry of the
Amended Modified Order on April 2, 2015, except for the Motion for
Reconsideration, which is not mentioned in the Amended Modified Order. 
6installments that CM is required to pay from $200.00 to $300.00. 
The Modified Order further provided that, in the absence of
payment by CM, CM's parents pay restitution to MV in the amount
of $6,884.04, in monthly installments of no less than $300.00.
On March 20, 2015, CM filed a Motion for
Reconsideration of Court's Order for Restitution on March 2, 2015
(Motion for Reconsideration ).  The Motion for Reconsideration
contained no reference to the Modified Order.  Rather, CM argued
that ordering restitution in the amount of $23,434.85 was
improper because the statutory provisions concerning restitution
in proceedings involving minors, HRS §§ 571-48(11) and (13), are
distinguishable from the restitution statutes applicable to
adults, in particular HRS § 706-646.  For this reason, and
others, CM argued that State v. Tuialii  is distinguishable and
should not be applied to this case.4  The State filed a response
and a hearing on the Motion for Reconsideration was set for April
20, 2015.
Prior to that hearing, on April 2, 2015, the Family
Court entered the Amended Modified Order.5  In the Amended
Modified Order, the Family Court increased the total restitution
amount back to the original amount of $23,434.85, in monthly
installments of no less than $300.00.  The Amended Modified Order FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
7did not further change the total restitution amount payable by
CM's parents ($6,884.04), in the absence of payments by CM. 
At the April 20, 2015 hearing, CM argued that the
restitution statute applicable to minors, HRS § 571-48(11),
should not be interpreted in the same manner as the penal code
restitution statute, particularly in light of the policy and
purpose of family court system, i.e., to promote reconciliation
of distressed juveniles and to foster rehabilitation of
juveniles, as well as to render appropriate punishment and reduce
juvenile delinquency.  Basically, CM argued that under Hawai #i's
statutory scheme, children are treated differently than adults. 
In addition, counsel pointed to the differences in the statutory
language and argued that, notwithstanding  Tuialii, the Family
Court has discretion not to order full restitution.  CM further
argued that, factually, the nature of CM's law violation was
different than the crime in  Tuialii and, unlike the defendant in
Tuialii, CM did not reap any financial benefit from his law
violation.  Finally, it was argued that the fact that both CM and
MV had the same insurance should be considered, as well as the
fact that medical costs and expenses were never directly charged
or paid out-of-pocket by MV or MV's family.
Pointing to Tuialii , the DPA argued that the Family
Court need not concern itself with the insurance matters and then
submitted on the State's written response, which argued, inter
alia, that failure to make CM pay would be a windfall to him,
that restitution serves a rehabilitative purpose, and that as a FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
8matter of public policy, juveniles should make restitution just
like adults.
At the conclusion of the parties' arguments, the Family
Court denied reconsideration of the prior restitution order,
declining to decide a restitution issue based on insurance
subrogation or reimbursement arguments, and citing Tuialii.  The
Family Court acknowledged the factual distinction between this
case and Tuialii, that CM and the victim both had the same
insurer.  The court made no comment on CM's other arguments
except to state, "[i]n 571-48, it just says that this Court can
order restitution."
On May 1, 2015, the Family Court entered its Order
Denying Reconsideration, which included, in relevant part, the
following FOFs and COLs:
Findings of Fact
1. The minor intentionally shot a pellet gun at a
fifteen year old girl's (victim) face on November 2, 2013
(the incident).
. . . .
5. The evidence is that the victim's medical bills
were shown to be $23,434.85 as a result of the incident.  
6. The State of Hawaii Med-QUEST Division (MQD)
provides eligible low-income adults and children access to
health and medical coverage through managed care plans.
7. The minor's family had Med-QUEST for medical
insurance.
8. The victim's family had MED-QUEST for medical
insurance.
9. The victim's medical bills of $23,434.85 were
paid in full by Med-QUEST. 
10. The victim had no out-of-pocket medical costs.
11. Therefore, both families involved in this
incident were covered under the Hawai# i Med-Quest program.FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
6COL 2 is not challenged on appeal and does not compel a plain
error review.  Therefore, we do not address whether it is an accurate and/or
complete statement of law.
912. The family court, pursuant to [HRS] § 571-48(11)
ordered restitution in this matter for the amount of the
medical bills, i.e., $23,434.85.
 
. . . .
14. This Court finds that the facts in this matter
are distinguishable from the facts set forth in St. v.
Tuialii, 121 Haw. 135, 214 P.3d 1125 (2009). 
Conclusions of Law
1. The purpose of a motion for reconsideration in
juvenile court cases is to allow the court and the parties
to make a complete record of the proceedings, and to set
forth in writing the findings and disposition of the family
court for appeal purposes.  HRS § 571-54 (2002).  In re Doe,
105 Haw. 505, 100 P.3d 75, (2004).
2. A motion for reconsideration is not an
opportunity for a party to attempt to get the court to
change its ruling -- it is to simply attempt to make a
complete record for an appeal.6
3. It is the law in Hawai# i that this court should
not sort out insurance indemnities, subrogation rights,
and/or other potential civil law implications before
ordering payment of restitution.  St. v. Tuialii, 121 Haw.
135, 214 P.3d 1125 (2009). 
4. Therefore, this court should not spend any time
on trying to determine insurance matters.  Tuialii, id,
(2009).
5. Restitution contains a rehabilitative component
as its purpose is not only to repay the person injured by
the criminal act, but also to develop in the offender a
degree of self-respect and pride for having righted a wrong
committed.  St. v. Feliciano, 103 Haw. 269, 81 P.3d 1184,
(2003).
6. The purpose and intent of court ordered
restitution is to have the convicted person repay society
and his victims for his criminal acts, whenever deemed
appropriate by sentencing court.  St. v. Johnson, 68 Haw.
292, 711 P.2d 1295 (1985).
7. The restitution statutes have a purpose and
design that encompasses both the punishment and the
rehabilitation of the offender.  HRS § 706-605(1)(e).  St.
v. Murray, 63 Haw. 12, 621 P.2d 334, (1980).
8. Legal or equitable principles, properly raised,
will preclude any double recovery against the minor in a
civil action or any unjust enrichment of either the
principle or its insurer.
9. The questions the sentencing court must answer
are whether the claimed loss resulted from the crime, andFOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
10whether it is the kind of loss for which restitution is
authorized. 
10. The applicable statute, HRS § 571-48(11),
plainly grants this court the discretion to make a
restitution award.
11. The statute requires no inquiry about the
viability of civil claims, nor is any such inquiry called
for by public policy. 
12. This Family Court need not sort out insurance
indemnities, subrogation rights, and/or other potential
civil law implications before ordering the minor to repay
the victim for medical costs under the restitution statute. 
Tuialii, [121 Hawai# i] at 142.
13. The fact that both families had Hawai# i Med-
QUEST does not change the consideration by this Court on the
issue of restitution. 
On May 18, 2015, CM timely filed a Notice of Appeal.
II.POINTS OF ERROR
On appeal, CM challenges all three restitution orders,
as well as COLs 3-9 & 11-13, and raises three points of error: 
(1) the Family Court erred in ordering restitution without a
restitution request; (2) the Family Court erred in ordering
restitution; and (3) the Family Court erred in ordering monthly
restitution payments of $300.00.
III.APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
The Family Court's authority to award restitution, is
based on a statute, HRS § 571-48(11) (2006).
The interpretation of a statute is a question of law
reviewable de novo. 
Furthermore, our statutory construction is guided by
established rules:
When construing a statute, our foremost obligation is
to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the
language contained in the statute itself.  And we must read
statutory language in the context of the entire statute and
construe it in a manner consistent with its purpose.
When there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or
indistinctiveness or uncertainty of an expression used in a
statute, an ambiguity exists.FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
11In construing an ambiguous statute, the meaning of the
ambiguous words may be sought by examining the context, with
which the ambiguous words, phrases, and sentences may be
compared, in order to ascertain their true meaning. 
Moreover, the courts may resort to extrinsic aids in
determining legislative intent.  One avenue is the use of
legislative history as an interpretive tool.  
[The appellate] court may also consider the reason and
spirit of the law, and the cause which induced the
legislature to enact it to discover its true meaning.  Laws
in pari materia, or upon the same subject matter, shall be
construed with reference to each other.  What is clear in
one statute may be called upon in aid to explain what is
doubtful in another.

(2005) (citations, internal quotation marks, brackets, and
ellipses omitted; format changed) (quoting State v. Kaua , 102
Hawai#i 1, 7-8, 72 P.3d 473, 479-80 (2003)).
HRS § 571-48(11) provides that the Family Court "may"
order restitution.  "The term 'may' is generally construed to
render optional, permissive, or discretionary th3 provision in
which it is embodied; this is so at least when there is nothing
in the wording, sense, or policy of the provision demanding an
unusual interpretation."  State v. Kahawai, 103 Hawai# i 462, 465,
83 P.3d 725, 728 (2004) (citation omitted).  "The trial court
abuses its discretion when it clearly exceeds the bounds of
reason or disregards rules or principles of law or practice to
the substantial detriment of a party litigant."  State v.
Plichta, 116 Hawai #i 200, 214, 172 P.3d 512, 526 (2007) (citation
and internal quotation marks omitted).
IV.DISCUSSION
A. The Request for Restitution
CM contends that the Family Court erred in ordering
restitution without a restitution request.  This contention isFOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
12without merit.  First, as argued by the State, this issue was not
raised in the Family Court proceedings and is deemed to be
waived.  See State v. Fagaragan , 115 Hawai #i 364, 367-68, 167
P.3d 739, 742-43 (2007).  Moreover, the record clearly shows that
MV's family did in fact request restitution.  The family's
request that restitution be made was noted at the November 10,
2014 hearing; it was reported in the January 5, 2015 Updated
Social History Report; it was again noted at the January 5, 2015
hearing.  At the March 2, 2015 restitution hearing, MV's mother
was at the courthouse to testify in support of the medical
records, but her testimony was unnecessary as CM's counsel had no
objection to their entry into admission or the reasonableness of
the medical expenses.
B.The Family Court's Order for Restitution
CM's primary argument on appeal is that the Family
Court erred in relying on Tuialii as binding authority and
support for ordering CM to pay restitution, emphasizing that
Tuialii is distinguishable because it dealt with an adult
criminal defendant ordered to pay restitution pursuant to HRS
§§ 706-605(7) (2014) & 706-646 (2014), as opposed to a minor law
violator ordered to pay restitution pursuant to HRS § 571-48(11). 
Before addressing the substance of this argument, we
note that CM did not make this argument to the Family Court at
the initial restitution hearing held on March 2, 2015.  At the
March 2, 2015 hearing, CM challenged the award of restitution on
the grounds that, unlike the situation in  Tuialii, CM and theFOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
7Although the Family Court's related conclusion, COL 13, is listed
in CM's points of error, CM makes no supporting argument. 
Tuialii8In , Tuialii argued, inter alia, that an insurer is not
entitled to restitution because it is not a victim within the meaning of HRS
§ 706-646(1).  121 Hawai# i at 140, 214 P.3d at 1130.  This court rejected
Tuialii's argument with respect to the order of restitution in that case,
which ordered Tuialii to pay restitution to the victim of crime, and not the
victim's insurer.  Id. 
13victim had the same insurance carrier.7  In light of that
argument, the Family Court stated that "[t]he issue is whether or
not the full amount should be awarded, pursuant to State versus
Tuialii."  The DPA then argued that the full amount should be
awarded because "a criminal court need not sort out insurance
indemnities, subrogation rights, or other potential civil law
implications before ordering a person convicted of a crime to
repay his victim under the criminal restitution statute."  The
DPA further argued that the same principle should be applied in
the family courts, i.e., that the family court judges should not
have to sort out any insurance-related issues.
The Family Court then noted that MV is the victim of
CM's law violation for restitution purposes,8 notwithstanding
that her medical bills were fully paid by insurance, but queried
whether HRS § 571-48(11), which the court noted "permits"
restitution, should be interpreted the same as the penal code
provision that was examined in Tuialii.  The DPA acknowledged the
lack of authoritative guidance, but posited that "the same line
of thinking as went along with restitution in a criminal case
would logically flow into the Family Court disposition, such as
this."  CM's lawyer pivoted back to his original argument and
requested the opportunity to submit an offer of proof as to theFOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
14two families' insurer carrier(s), which was allowed.  He further
argued that, unlike the defendant in Tuialii , neither CM nor his
parents received a windfall from the "crime" and there is no
rehabilitative purpose in ordering the restitution.  Based on the
arguments that were presented, the Family Court orally ruled:
Okay. You know, I kind of agree with [the DPA]. 
Tuialii applies in this case as far as restitution.  And
it's not up to this Court to start sorting out who paid
what.  I believe Tuialii is clear that this Court should
order the full amount of restitution.  And it's up to the
parties, then, in some other matter or some other venue to
then try and resolve as far as insurance payments, and so
forth.
So I am going to order -- what was proven to this
Court was the victim suffered medical costs in the amount of
$23,434.85.  And that the minor shall be ordered to pay
restitution in amount of $23,434.85.  And that is to be paid
in the amount of $200 a month, beginning the last day -- and
it will be due the last day of each month, beginning April
2015.
This is an interesting issue, Mr. [CM's attorney]. 
Perhaps maybe one of you can do further research and do a
motion for reconsideration.
In the Motion for Reconsideration, however, CM made two
overarching arguments for reconsideration of the order for
restitution:  (1) that family court matters involving minors are
distinguishable from adult criminals matters and the respective
statutory restitution provisions are different, which is the
primary argument made on appeal; and (2) that this case is
factually distinguishable from  Tuialii on various grounds,
including that there is no windfall benefit to CM, because this
case involves medical expenses rather than theft, and his earlier
argument, that in this case both CM and his victim were covered
by Quest, which is a state and federally-funded Medicaid program FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

(describing Quest).
15that provides health coverage through health plans for eligible
Hawai#i residents.9
In its oral ruling at the April 20, 2015 hearing on the
Motion for Reconsideration, the Family Court recognized the
factual distinctions between this case and Tuialii  as to the
common insurance company.  The Family Court then reiterated that,
based on Tuialii, it should not attempt to decide issues
involving subrogation, reimbursement, or other insurance related
matters in conjunction with its decision to order CM to pay
restitution to the victim of his law violation.  The Family Court
did not address CM's arguments concerning the differences between
juvenile and adult criminal proceedings, either at the hearing or
in the Order Denying Reconsideration.
1.Tuialii
In Tuialii, Tuialii argued that ordering him to pay
restitution was illegal because:  (1) an insurance company is not
a victim under HRS § 706-646; (2) the plain language of HRS
§ 706-646 disallows restitution to the extent the victim received
insurance payments; and (3) if the victim was covered by
insurance, then restitution was neither rehabilitative nor
compensatory.  121 Hawai #i at 139, 214 P.3d at 1129.  This court
rejected these arguments, based on its review and application of
HRS §§ 706-605(7) and 706-646, and held that:  (1) Tuialii was
properly ordered to pay restitution to the victim of Tuialii's
theft, not the victim's insurer, in compliance with HRS § 706-FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
16646(1); (2) HRS § 706-646 does not support the theory that a
crime victim has not suffered a loss if (or to the extent that)
the victim has received indemnification from an insurer; and (3)
ordering a criminal defendant to repay the full amount of the
losses caused by his or her crime furthers the rehabilitative
purpose of HRS § 706-646 and properly compensates the victim for
losses suffered as a result of the defendant's offense.  Id.  at
140-42, 214 P.3d at 1130-32.  With regard to the latter issue,
this court further concluded that a "criminal court need not sort
out insurance indemnities, subrogation rights, and/or other
potential civil law implications before ordering a thief or other
criminal to repay his victim under the criminal restitution
statute."  Id. at 142, 214 P.3d at 1132.
Upon review of the Family Court's Order Denying
Reconsideration in this case, we cannot conclude that the
challenged COLS, enumerated above, wrongly state the law
(concerning restitution in criminal matters) or are inconsistent
with Tuialii or the other cases cited by the Family Court. 
Notwithstanding the differences between the chapter 571
restitution provisions and the Hawai #i Penal Code restitution
provisions, which we address below, the Family Court did not err
in concluding that family courts, like criminal courts, need not
sort out insurance indemnities, subrogation rights, and/or other
potential civil law implications before ordering a minor law
violator to repay his or her victim under the family court
restitution statute, HRS § 571-48(11).  The rationale stated in
Tuialii for disregarding the insurance status of the victim,FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
10However, as discussed below, the principles of law stated are not
fully and necessarily applicable to family court law violation adjudications.
17which is based on rehabilitative and compensatory principles, is
applicable to family court restitution proceedings.  See Tuialii ,
121 Hawai #i at 142, 214 P.3d at 1132; see also Bynum v. Magno ,
106 Hawai #i 81, 101 P.3d 1149 (2004) (prohibiting the reduction
of a tort plaintiff's damages award to reflect discounted amounts
paid by Medicare/Medicaid, as well as payments/benefits received
by insurance, based on the collateral source rule).  
Nevertheless, we must consider the differences between the
restitution statutes applicable to juveniles and adults.
2.Restitution and Juvenile Justice
Although we find no specific error in the Family
Court's written COLS that are challenged on appeal,10 it appears
from the record that the Family Court's restitution order may
have been based on an erroneous view that Tuialii  compelled the
Family Court to order CM to pay restitution in the full amount of
MV's medical expenses.  At the March 2, 2015 hearing, in
announcing its ruling, the Family Court stated, "I believe
Tuialii is clear that this Court should order the full amount of
restitution."  Although this statement was made without the
benefit of CM's later arguments and citations concerning the
differences between the chapter 571 restitution provision and the
adult penal code restitution statute, it is unclear whether the
Family Court continued to view Tuialii  as nevertheless mandating
this result.
We begin with the applicable statutes.  In this case,FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
18restitution was ordered pursuant to HRS § 571-48(11), which
provides:
(11)The court may order any person adjudicated pursuant to
section 571-11(1) to make restitution of money or
services to any victim who suffers loss as a result of
the child's action, or to render community service;
(Emphasis added.)
In contrast, HRS § 706-605(7) provides:
(7) The court shall order the defendant to make
restitution for losses as provided in section 706-646.  In
ordering restitution, the court shall not consider the
defendant's financial ability to make restitution in
determining the amount of restitution to order.  The court,
however, shall consider the defendant's financial ability to
make restitution for the purpose of establishing the time
and manner of payment.
(Emphasis added.)
HRS § 706-646(2) and (3) further specify:
§ 706-646 Victim restitution.  
. . . .
(2) The court shall order the defendant to make
restitution for reasonable and verified losses suffered by
the victim or victims as a result of the defendant's offense
when requested by the victim. . . .
 
(3) In ordering restitution, the court shall not
consider the defendant's financial ability to make
restitution in determining the amount of restitution to
order.  The court, however, shall consider the defendant's
financial ability to make restitution for the purpose of
establishing the time and manner of payment. The court shall
specify the time and manner in which restitution is to be
paid.  Restitution shall be a dollar amount that is
sufficient to reimburse any victim fully for losses [.]
(Emphasis added.)
Unlike the penal code statute, the family court
restitution statute is permissive or discretionary and does not
mandate an order for restitution in every case in which
restitution is requested.  It appears that the Family Court
recognized this distinction.  See, e.g., COL 10.  HRS § 571-
48(11) provides even greater flexibility, however, authorizing aFOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
11We note that, in 2006, the legislature amended HRS § 706-646, to
remove the criminal court's discretion in ordering restitution, changing "may
order" to "shall order," as well as precluding the criminal court from
considering the defendant's ability to pay when determining the amount of
restitution.  See 2006 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 230.  No similar changes were made
to the family court restitution statute.
19family court to order a minor law violator to make restitution by
way of services to the victim, or to render community services
instead, and does not specifically require reimbursement of the
"full amount" of the victim's loss.  These options stand in sharp
contrast to the HRS § 706-646(3) mandate that "[r]estitution
shall be a dollar amount that is sufficient to reimburse any
victim fully for losses[.]"11  HRS § 571-48(11) does not
prohibit, for example, a family court's consideration of a young
teen's ability to pay full restitution or the impact of a
restitution order on a distressed family.  There is nothing in
the record to indicate that the Family Court considered these
issues and alternatives and, as noted above, it appears that the
Family Court may have considered itself restrained from
exercising these options.
HRS § 571-1 provides that, pursuant to chapter 571, the
family courts are established "for a policy and purpose of said
courts to promote the reconciliation of distressed juveniles with
their families, foster the rehabilitation of juveniles in
difficulty, render appropriate punishment to offenders, and
reduce juvenile delinquency."  The mandate of the family courts
includes that "all children found responsible for offenses shall
receive dispositions that provide incentive for reform or
deterrence from further misconduct, or both."  HRS § 571-1.  TheFOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
20Hawai#i Supreme Court has long recognized the significant
differences between juvenile adjudications and adult criminal
proceedings.  See, e.g., State v. Riveira , 92 Hawai #i 521, 993
P.2d 555 (2000); State v. Sylva , 61 Haw. 385, 605 P.2d 496
(1980).  Here, the Family Court relied strictly on adult criminal
restitution cases and principles (see  COLs 5-7 & 9) and
concluded, inter alia, that "[t]he questions the sentencing court
must answer are whether the claimed loss resulted from the crime,
and whether it is the kind of loss for which restitution is
authorized."  COL 9.  This inquiry is too narrow in the context
of juvenile restitution proceedings pursuant to HRS § 571-48(11).
For these reasons, we conclude that the Order Denying
Reconsideration, and the Family Court's restitution orders must
be vacated and a new restitution hearing consistent with this
opinion must be held on remand.
C.Monthly Restitution Payments of $300.00
CM argues that the Family Court erred in ordering
monthly payments of $300.00 because (1) the Family Court failed
to consider CM's ability to make restitution payments for the
purpose of establishing the time and manner of payment, as
required in HRS § 706-646(3), and (2) the Family Court issued
various orders in varying amounts, without notice, an opportunity
to be heard, or an explanation as to why its decision changed. 
We agree.  "While HRS § 571-11(1) proceedings need not conform
with all of the requirements of a criminal trial, such
proceedings must 'scrupulously maintain standards consistent with
fundamental fairness.'"  In re TC , 121 Hawai #i 92, 100, 214 P.3dFOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
211082, 1090 (App. 2009) (quoting  In re Doe , 62 Haw. 70, 73, 610
P.2d 509, 511-12 (1980)) (footnote omitted).  We conclude that,
when ordering restitution under HRS § 571-48(11), the Family
Court is required to consider, inter alia , the minor's financial
ability to make restitution payments for the purpose of
establishing the time and manner of payment.  See, e.g., State v.
Johnson, 68 Haw. 292, 297, 711 P.2d 1296, 1299 (1985) (holding
that "[t]he manner of payment must be reasonable and one that
Defendant can afford taking into account Defendant's financial
circumstances").  At a minimum, CM had a right to notice and an
opportunity to be heard prior to the Family Court's material
changes to the ordered restitution.
V.CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the Family Court's
May 1, 2015 Order Denying Reconsideration, as well as the March
2, March 16, and April 2, 2015 restitution orders, and remand
this case for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.
