(Appellee Alana), August 28, 2015 motion to dismiss appellate

Silva, deceased, Brian Smith, and Kelly Heiman's (the Appellants) 
September 2, 2015 memorandum in opposition to Appellee Alana's August 28, 2015 motion to dismiss, and (3) the record, it appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction over the Appellants' appeal from the Honorable Rhonda I.L. Loo's March 13, 2015 "Order Denying Plaintiffs' Motion for an Order Directing Entry of Final Judgments Pursuant to CAAP Awards Dated December 8, 2014" (the March 13, 2015 interlocutory order), because the circuit court has not yet reduced any dispositive rulings to a separate judgment, as Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2014) requires for an appeal from a civil circuit court case under Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) and 
the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994), the April 28, 2015 
order purporting to authorize the interlocutory appeal of the March 13, 2015 interlocutory order is deficient, and, even if the March 13, 2015 interlocutory order were an independently appealable order, the Appellants' May 18, 2015 notice of appeal is not timely as to the March 13, 2015 interlocutory order under Rule 4(a)(1) of the Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP). 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals to the Hawai 'i 
Intermediate Court of Appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). HRCP Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." Based on HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i requires that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after 
the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has 
-2­ NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties 
pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 
P.2d at 1338. "Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai
'i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 
1186 (2008). The circuit court has not reduced any of its dispositive rulings to an appealable final judgment. 
Although exceptions to the final judgment requirement 
exist under the doctrine in Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848) (the Forgay doctrine), the collateral order doctrine, and HRS § 641-1(b) (1993 & Supp. 2014), the March 13, 2015 interlocutory order does not satisfy the requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine, the collateral order doctrine, and HRS § 641-1(b). See Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai
'i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 
702, 704 (1995) (regarding the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai
'i 319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding 
the three requirements for the collateral order doctrine); HRS § 641-1(b) (regarding the requirements for an appeal from an interlocutory order). 
We note, in particular, that when a party moves a
 
circuit court for leave to assert an interlocutory appeal from an
 order pursuant to HRS § 641-1(b), the circuit court must do more
 than enter a written order granting the motion. The circuit
 court's written order must also include an express conclusion
 
that the interlocutory appeal isadvisable for the speedy
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
termination of litigation before it, and the circuit court must
 
expressly set forth in the order its reasons in support of that
 conclusion:
 
If any order is entered, other than a final judgment, and a
party moved for an interlocutory appeal pursuant to HRS
§ 641-1(b) or 641-17, the trial court shall carefully
consider the matter of whether it thinks an interlocutory
appeal will more speedily determine the litigation and, if
it so concludes, will set forth, in the order allowing the
appeal, its reasons for that conclusion.
 
Mason v. Water Resources International, 67 Haw. 510, 511-12, 694
 
P.2d 388, 389 (1985) (emphases added). In the instant case, the
 circuit court entered an April 28, 2015 order purporting to grant
 the Appellants' motion for leave to assert an interlocutory
 appeal from the March 13, 2015 interlocutory order pursuant to
 HRS § 641-1(b), but, contrary to the requirements under HRS
 § 641-1(b) and the holding in Mason, the April 28, 2015 order
 does not contain any express conclusion that an interlocutory
 appeal is advisable for the speedy termination of litigation
 before it, nor does the April 28, 2015 order contain the circuit
 court's reasons for that conclusion. 
Moreover, the Appellants' appeal from the March 13,
 
2015 interlocutory order is untimely under HRAP Rule 4(a)(1). 
"The order appealed from on an interlocutory appeal is not made
 final, for any purpose, by the allowance of the interlocutory
 appeal and the time period runs from the entry of the order, not
 from the allowance of the appeal." King v. Wholesale Produce
 
Dealers Ass'n of Hawaii, 69 Haw. 334, 335, 741 P.2d 721, 722

(1987) (emphasis added);  See also State v. Irvine, 88 Hawai 'i 
404 406, 967 P.2d 236, 238 (1988) and Kohala Agriculture v. 
Deloitte & Touche, 86 Hawai 'i 301, 311, 9494 P.2d 141, 151 (App. 
1997). 
In the instant case, the Appellants did not file their
 
May 18, 2014 notice of appeal within thirty days after entry of
 the March 13, 2015 interlocutory order, as HRAP Rule 4(a)(1)
 required under the holding in King v. Wholesale Produce Dealers
 Ass'n of Hawaii. The failure to file a timely notice of appeal
 in a civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the parties
 cannot waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in the
 exercise of judicial discretion. Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648,
 
650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or
 judge or justice is authorized to change the jurisdictional
 requirements contained in Rule 4 of these rules."); HRAP
 Rule 26(e) ("The reviewing court for good cause shown may relieve
 a party from a default occasioned by any failure to comply with
 these rules, except the failure to give timely notice of
 appeal."). Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellee Alana's August 28,
 
1 With respect to certification of a circuit court's
adjudication of one or more but less than all claims for an
appeal pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b), the Supreme Court of Hawai 'i 
has stated that Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76Hawai
'i 115, 869 P.2d 1334 (1994) overruled King v. Wholesale
Produce Dealers Ass'n of Hawaii, 69 Haw. 334, 741 P.2d 721(1987). Oppenheimer v. AIG Hawaii Ins. Co., 77 Hawai
'i 88, 93,
881 P.2d 1234, 1239 (1994). However, the holding in Jenkins"does not appear to disturb the holding in King with respect toHRS § 641-1(b)." Kohala Agriculture v. Deloitte & Touche, 86 
Hawai
'i 301, 311 n.19, 9494 P.2d 141, 151 n.19 (App. 1997).
