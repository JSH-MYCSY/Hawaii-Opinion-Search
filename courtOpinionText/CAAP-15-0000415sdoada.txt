APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CRIMINAL NO. 13-1-0428(1))

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Nelson N. Waikiki, Jr. (Waikiki),
 
appearing pro se, seems to appeal from the "Judgment Conviction
 
and Sentence" entered on May 1, 2015 in the Circuit Court of the
 
1
Second Circuit  (circuit court).
 
Waikiki was convicted and found guilty of: failure to

 
meet securities registration requirements in violation of Hawaii
 Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 485A-301 (2008 Repl.) & 485A-508(a)(3)
 
(2008 Repl.) (Count One); failure to meet broker-dealer

requirements and exemptions in violation of HRS §§ 485A-401 (2008
 
Repl.) & 485A-508(a)(3) (Count Two); and general securities fraud
 in violation of HRS §§ 485A-501(a)(2), (3) (2008 Repl.) & 485A­508(a)(3) (Counts Three and Four).
 
To the extent that we can discern his argument on 
appeal, Waikiki challenges his conviction on the basis that he is a citizen of the Kingdom of Hawai
'i and not subject to 
prosecution by the State of Hawai 'i.2 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments and the issues raised by the parties, as well as
 the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude Waikiki's appeal
 is without merit.
 
We have previously rejected arguments based on claims 
that the State of Hawai
'i does not have jurisdiction over 
citizens of the Kingdom of Hawai 'i, or that the State of Hawai 'i 
is an illegitimate government. See State of Fergerstrom, 106 
Hawai'i 43, 55, 101 P.3d 652, 664 (App. 2004), aff'd, 106 Hawai 'i 
41, 101 P.3d 225 (2004). The Hawai 'i Supreme Court recently 
reaffirmed that "'whatever may be said regarding the lawfulness' of its origins, 'the State of Hawai
'i is now, a lawful 
government.' Individuals claiming to be citizens of the Kingdom and not of the State are not exempt from application of the State's laws." State v. Kaulia, 128 Hawai
'i 479, 487, 291 P.3d 
377, 385 (2013) (internal citation, brackets and ellipses omitted) (quoting Fergerstrom, 106 Hawai
'i at 55, 101 P.3d at 
664). Waikiki is not exempt from the laws of the State of Hawai
'i regulating securities, and we decline to overturn his 
conviction. 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Judgment and Conviction 
2
 Waikiki's opening brief is an article dated August 4, 2013, written by
David Keanu Sai, Ph.D., and titled "The Continuity of the Hawaiian State and
the Legitimacy of the Acting Government of the Hawaiian Kingdom." The article
 includes no reference to Waikiki's case or appeal.
