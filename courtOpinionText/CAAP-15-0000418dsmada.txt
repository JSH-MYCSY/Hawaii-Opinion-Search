NO. CAAP-15-0000418
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
RNM, Petitioner-Appellee, v. JMKK, Respondent-Appellant,
and CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT AGENCY, STATE OF HAWAI 'I,
Respondent-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-P NO. 13-1-6166)

 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, the papers in support, and
 
the records and files herein, it appears that on June 5, 2014,
 
Petitioner-Appellee RNM (Father) and Respondent-Appellant JMKK
 (Mother) entered into, and the Family Court of the First Circuit
 
1
(Family Court)  approved and ordered, a "Stipulation Regarding
Petitioner's Petition for Paternity or For Custody, Visitation

 
and Support Orders After Voluntary Establishment of Paternity
 Filed May 3, 2013" (Stipulation/Order) regarding their child RJKK
 (Child) in FC-P No. 13-1-6166. Subsequently, Mother appealed
 from a July 15, 2014 order (First Order) denying her July 11,
 2014 "Motion for Relief After Judgment or Order" (First Motion
 for Relocation) in which Mother sought, among other things to
 relocate with Child to Oklahoma. This appeal was given number
 CAAP-14-0001051. On November 12, 2015, this court held that
 Mother had made a sufficient showing of a material change in
 circumstances between the June 5, 2014 Stipulation/Order and her
 First Motion for Relocation, vacated the First Order, and

 The Honorable Gale L.F. Ching presided.

remanded the case to the Family Court for further proceedings. 
RNM v. JMKK, No. CAAP-14-0001051, 136 Hawai 'i 372, 362 P.3d 805, 
2015 WL 7075178 (App. Nov. 12, 2015) (mem.). On February 29, 2016, Father applied to the Hawai
'i Supreme Court for a writ of 
certiorari in SCWC-14-0001051, which the supreme court rejected on April 12, 2016. 
On February 4, 2015, while the appeal in CAAP-14Â­
0001051 was pending, Mother filed a second "Motion for Relief
 after Judgment or Order" (Second Motion for Relocation), seeking
 permission to relocate out of state and for sole legal custody. 
Mother asserted that circumstances substantially changed since
 the Stipulation/Order because her parents and sisters, whom she
 lived with and were her only support system, had moved to
 Oklahoma. On March 9, 2015, the Family Court entered an order
 denying Mother's Second Motion for Relocation (Second Order), on
 the basis that she relied on the same circumstances which were
 the basis of her First Motion for Relocation and the First Order
 was still pending on appeal.
 
On March 2, 2015--after the Family Court orally ruled
 
on the February 4, 2015 motion, but before the Second Order was
 entered--Mother filed a "Motion to Reconsider [the] February 19,
 2015 Order and Decision on the Motion for Relief after Judgment
 
2
or Order Filed [February 4, 2015]  " (Motion for Reconsideration). 
In this Motion for Reconsideration, Mother asserted the same

 
facts in support of her argument that circumstances significantly
 changed as she did in her Second Motion for Relocation. The
 Family Court denied the Motion for Reconsideration in an
 April 20, 2015 order. Mother now appeals from the orders denying
 her Second Motion for Relocation and Motion for Reconsideration.
 
"It is axiomatic that mootness is an issue of subject 
matter jurisdiction. 
Whether a court possesses subject matter 
jurisdiction is a question of law reviewable de novo." Cty. of 
Hawai'i v. Ala Loop Homeowners, 123 Hawai 'i 391, 403-04, 235 P.3d 
1103, 1115-16 (2012) (citation omitted).

 Mother's motion, filed pro se, incorrectly stated the Motion for
Relief was filed December 19, 2014.

"It is established in Hawai 'i that 
[a] case is moot where the question to be determined
is abstract and does not rest on existing facts or
rights. Thus, the mootness doctrine is properly
invoked where 'events . . . have so affected the
 relations between the parties that the two conditions
for justiciability relevant on appeal--adverse
interest and effective remedy--have been
compromised.'"
 
In re Doe Children, 105 Hawai 'i 38, 56, 93 P.3d 1145, 1163 (2004) 
(citations omitted). 
Based on this court's holding in RNM v. JMKK, Mother no
 
longer has an adverse interest or an effective remedy. Her
 
Second Motion for Relocation asserted the same facts in support
 of her argument that there was a material change in circumstances
 as her First Motion for Relocation. This court has already
 granted the remedy Mother seeks in this appeal by vacating the
 Family Court's First Order and remanding for a determination of
 whether the change in custody is in the best interests of the
 child. RNM v. JMKK, mem. op. at *4. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is
 
dismissed as moot.
