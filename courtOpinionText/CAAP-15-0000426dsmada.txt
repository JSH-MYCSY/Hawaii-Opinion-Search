(2) On May 27, 2015, this court dismissed the appeal in
 
CAAP-14-0001389 for lack of jurisdiction, and ordered the
 
appellate clerk to create a new appeal with Appellants' May 8,
 2015 notice of appeal filed in CAAP-14-0001389. The new appeal
 was designated CAAP-15-0000426;
 
(3) On July 2, 2015, the circuit court clerk filed the
 
record on appeal in CAAP-15-0000426, and the appellate clerk
 notified the parties that the statement of jurisdiction and
 opening brief were due on or before July 13, 2015, and August 11,
 2015, respectively;
 
(4) Appellants did not file either document, or request
 
an extension of time; 
(5) On August 17, 2015, the appellate clerk notified 
Appellant that the time for filing the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief had expired and, pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure Rule 30, the matter would be called to the court’s attention on August 27, 2015, for such action as the court deems proper, which could include dismissal; and 
(6) Thereafter, Appellants did not file the statement
 
of jurisdiction or opening brief, or respond to the notice of
 default. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, November 30, 2015.
