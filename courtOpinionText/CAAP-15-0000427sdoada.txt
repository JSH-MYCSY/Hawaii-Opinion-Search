APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 12-1-0628)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Reifurth, Presiding Judge, Ginoza and Chan, JJ.)
Defendantâ€“Appellant Lovey Mae Scott (Scott), pro se,
appeals from 1) the December 11, 2014 judgment pursuant to the
"Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Order Confirming
Foreclosure Sale, Allowance of Costs, Commissions, Fees,
Directing Conveyance and for Writ of Possession Filed
September 5, 2014" (Order Confirming Sale), and 2) the April 28,
2015 "Order Denying Defendant Lovey May Scott Notice of Non
Hearing Motion to Allow Plaintiff Time to Respond to Defendant
Lovey Mae Scott Ex Parte Motion to Relief/Vacate Plaintiff's
Motion for Order Confirming Foreclosure Sale Allowance of Costs,

Possession Filed September 5, 2014; and Judgment, Filed
December 11, 2014 Filed on January 5, 2015" (4/28/15 Order), both
entered in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee American Estate & Trust,
LC, Trustees, FBO (American Estate) in the Circuit Court of the
Third Circuit (circuit court).1  Scott also attempts to appeal
from the September 26, 2013 judgment pursuant to the "Findings of
Fact, Conclusions of Law, Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for
Default and/or Summary Judgment Against All Parties and for
Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure Filed August 2, 2013" (Order
Granting MSJ/Decree of Foreclosure), however, we lack appellate
jurisdiction to review the Order Granting MSJ/Decree of
Foreclosure because Scott failed to file a timely notice of
appeal pursuant to Rule 4(a)(1) of the Hawai #i Rules of Appellate
Procedure.
On appeal, Scott appears to contend that the circuit
court erred in entering both (1) the judgment pursuant to the
Order Confirming Sale and (2) the 4/28/15 Order, because i) Scott
had not received proper notice of American Estate's "Motion for
Default and/or Summary Judgment Against All Parties and for
Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure" (MSJ), and ii) American
Estate lacked standing to foreclose.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Scott's
points of error as follows, and affirm.
(1) Order Confirming Sale
i) Notice of MSJ
In her Opening Brief, Scott contends that she filed her
October 10, 2014 motion (10/10/14 Motion) in order "to object
[to] the confirmation, based on lack of notice on the summary
judgment."  However, this contention is untrue, as Scott did not
raise the allegation that she had not received proper notice of
American Estate's MSJ until November 19, 2014 in her "Motion to
1The Honorable Greg K. Nakamura presided.
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
Deny" American Estate's proposed order granting the motion to
confirm the sale (Motion to Confirm Sale) and judgment. Scott
also had not raised this allegation at the October 30, 2014
hearing on the Motion to Confirm Sale.  It was only after the
circuit court had orally granted the Motion to Confirm Sale and
American Estate had submitted its proposed order granting the
Motion to Confirm Sale that Scott alleged for the first time that
she had not received notice of the MSJ.
ii) Standing
Scott's 10/10/2014 Motion, which was filed in
opposition to American Estate's Motion to Confirm Sale, also
challenges American Estate's standing to foreclose her mortgage.
However, we conclude that, pursuant to Mortgage Elec.
Registration Sys., Inc. v. Wise
, 130 Hawai# i 11, 304 P.3d 1192
(2013), the res judicata  effect of the judgment pursuant to the
Order Granting MSJ/Decree of Foreclosure bars Scott's request for
relief in this appeal.  In Wise, the supreme court held that the
doctrine of res judicata  precludes foreclosure defendants from
raising defenses at the confirmation of the sale of the subject
property that could have been raised in the earlier foreclosure
proceedings.  Id. at 17-18, 304 P.3d at 1198-99.  Although
American Estate did not raise the issue of res judicata  in its
reply to Scott's 10/10/2014 Motion, Wise  specifically states that
the preclusive effect of this doctrine can be raised for the
first time on appeal.  Id.  at 18, 304 P.3d at 1199.  American
Estates asserts res judicata under Wise in its answering brief.
(2) 4/28/15 Order
On December 22, 2014, Scott filed a motion requesting
that the circuit court vacate the Order Granting MSJ/Decree of
Foreclosure, the Order Confirming Sale, and both underlying
judgments, on the grounds that i) Scott had not received proper
notice of the MSJ, and ii) American Estate never had standing to
foreclose the subject mortgage (12/22/14 Motion).
On January 5, 2015, Scott filed a motion to have the
circuit court allow American Estate time to respond to Scott's
12/22/14 Motion (1/5/15 Motion).  The circuit court subsequently
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
denied the 1/5/15 Motion in the 4/28/15 Order.  The record does
not indicate that the 12/22/14 Motion was adjudicated.
Scott now appeals the circuit court's 4/28/15 Order.
However, Scott fails to state any alleged error committed by the
circuit court in entering the 4/28/15 Order.  See Asato v.
Procurement Policy Bd., 132 Hawai# i 333, 354 n.22, 322 P.3d 228,
249 n.22 (2014) ("However, these are not truly 'points of error'
inasmuch as they do not state an 'alleged error committed by the
court[.]'  Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule
28(b)(4)(i).").  Regardless, we conclude that Scott's primary
arguments on appeal, regarding the notice and standing issues
discussed above, are irrelevant to the 4/28/15 Order and the
1/5/15 Motion.
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the circuit court's
December 11, 2014 judgment pursuant to the "Order Granting
Plaintiff's Motion for Order Confirming Foreclosure Sale,
Allowance of Costs, Commissions, Fees, Directing Conveyance and
for Writ of Possession Filed September 5, 2014" and the April 28,
2015 "Order Denying Defendant Lovey May Scott Notice of Non
Hearing Motion to Allow Plaintiff Time to Respond to Defendant
Lovey Mae Scott Ex Parte Motion to Relief/Vacate Plaintiff's
Motion for Order Confirming Foreclosure Sale Allowance of Costs,
Commissions, Fees, Directing Conveyance and for Writ of
Possession Filed September 5, 2014; and Judgment, Filed
December 11, 2014 Filed on January 5, 2015."
