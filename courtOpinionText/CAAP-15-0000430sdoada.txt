DAVID T. CHAPPELL, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
WAILUKU DIVISION
(CASE NO. 2DTA-14-00976)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant David T. Chappell (Chappell)
appeals from the Judgment and Notice of Entry of Judgment,
entered on April 29, 2015, in the District Court of the Second
Circuit, Wailuku Division (District Court).1  The District Court
found Chappell guilty of one count of Operating a Vehicle Under
the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii
Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 291E-61(a)(1) (Supp. 2015),2 and one
count of refusal to submit to breath, blood, or urine test, in
violation of HRS ยง 291E-15 (Supp. 2015). 
On appeal, Chappell argues that the District Court
erred in convicting him of OVUII after erroneously admitting into
evidence his Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN) test results without
a sufficient foundation and, in the alternative, as substantiveNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2evidence of impairment; and without the HGN results, there was
insufficient evidence to support the conviction.  
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve Chappell's points of error as follows.
Even without the HGN test results there was
overwhelming, compelling evidence to support the conviction;
therefore, any error on the part of the District Court in
admitting evidence of the test results was harmless.  See State
v. Kam, 134 Hawai# i 280, 287, 339 P.3d 1081, 1088 (App. 2014), as

Sergeant Nicholas Krau (Sergeant Krau) testified that
when he first noticed Chappell's van, it was traveling at a high
rate of speed.  While speaking to Chappell, the officer noticed
Chappell had red, watery eyes, red facial features, slurred
speech, and a strong odor of liquor clearly coming from his
breath and not his person or the van.  When Chappell exited the
van, he was unsteady on his feet and took a moment to gain his
bearings while standing up on the level, dry roadway.  In
response to Sergeant Krau's specific questions, Chappell did not
indicate he was under a doctor's care or had any physical
disabilities or leg injuries or other issues that would prevent
him from taking or affect his performance on the FSTs. 
During the first part of the one-leg-stand test,
Chappell raised his arms between twelve and eighteen inches and
"fluctuated" his arms to help him balance, and he put his foot
down to balance.  During the second part, Chappell continually
swayed, with his arms raised between twelve and eighteen inches
and fluctuating to help him balance, put his foot down toNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
3balance, and said, "I can't do this.  I obviously drank too
much."  He did not complete the test.
Sergeant Krau testified that based on his observations,
there was absolutely no doubt in his mind that Chappell was
impaired and unable to operate a vehicle safely on the roadway. 
See State v. Ferrer , 95 Hawai #i 409, 429, 23 P.3d 744, 764 (2001)
("[I]t is permissible for a police officer to testify as a lay
witness about his or her observations of a defendant's
performance on various FSTs and to give an opinion, based on such
observations, that the defendant was intoxicated.").
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment and
Notice of Entry of Judgment, entered on April 29, 2015, in the
District Court of the Second Circuit, Wailuku Division is
affirmed.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, December 22, 2016.
