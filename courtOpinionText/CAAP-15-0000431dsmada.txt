APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 14-1-0097-01)

 
ORDER
 
DISMISSING APPELLATE COURT CASE NUMBER
 
CAAP-15-0000431 FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
AND

 
DISMISSING AS MOOT ALL PENDING MOTIONS IN
 
APPELLATE COURT CASE NUMBER CAAP-15-0000431

 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
jurisdiction over the appeal that Plaintiff-Appellant Ambrose S. 
Fernandez, Jr. (Appellant Fernandez) has asserted from the Honorable Karl K. Sakamoto's December 31, 2014 final judgment and March 20, 2015 post-judgment order, because Appellant Fernandez's May 20, 2015 notice of appeal is untimely under Rule 4(a) of the Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP). 
Although the December 31, 2014 final judgment and
 
March 20, 2015 post-judgment order were final and appealable
 under Hawaii Revised Statutes § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2014),
 HRAP Rule 4(a) required Appellant Fernandez to file a notice of
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appeal within thirty days after entry of any appealable judgment
 
or appealable post-judgment order. Appellant Fernandez did not
 file his May 20, 2015 notice of appeal within thirty days after
 entry of the December 31, 2014 final judgment or the March 20,
 2015 post-judgment order, as HRAP Rule 4(a) required him to do.
 
The circuit court appears to have stamped a written
 
request by Appellant Fernandez as "DENIED" on April 7, 2015. 
Even assuming that this was an appealable order, Appellant
 Fernandez did not file his May 20, 2015 notice of appeal within
 thirty days after entry of the April 7, 2015 file-stamped
 document.
 
The failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a
 
civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot
 waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise
 of judicial discretion. Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727
 
P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or
 justice is authorized to change the jurisdictional requirements
 contained in Rule 4 of [the HRAP]."). Consequently, we lack
 appellate jurisdiction over this case. Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number
 
CAAP-15-0000431 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions
 
in appellate court case number CAAP-15-0000431 are dismissed as
 moot.
