SB, Respondent-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
(UIFS (FR) NO. 13-1-0013)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
This case arises out of a proceeding to enforce a
divorce-related support order issued by the District Court of
Logan County, Colorado.  Respondent-Appellant SB ("Father"), pro
se, appeals from the May 1, 2015 Order Establishing Child Support
Debt and a Repayment Plan ("May 1, 2015 Child Support Order")
entered by the Family Court of the Third Circuit ("Family
Court"),1/ which determined the arrearages owed by Father and
specified a payment plan.
On appeal, Father appears to contend2/ that: (1) the
1/The Honorable Henry T. Nakamoto presided. 
2/Father's opening brief fails to comply with Hawai #i Rules of
Appellate Procedure Rule 28 in numerous respects including a failure to
provide a concise statement of the points of error in separately numbered
paragraphs, with each point stating the alleged error committed by the court
or agency, where in the record the alleged error occurred, and where in the
record the alleged error was objected to or the manner in which the alleged
error was brought to the attention of the court or agency.  Haw. R. App. P.
28(b)(4).  Father's points of error appear scattered and stated differently
across several sections of his opening brief.  However, because it is our
practice to afford litigants the opportunity to have their cases heard on the
merits, where possible, we have endeavored to summarize and restate Father'sNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
Family Court denied him due process by not allowing him to
present a witness at a hearing on March 30, 2015, and by denying
him the right to speak for himself at a hearing on October 26,
2015; and (2) the Family Court did not have jurisdiction to
establish the child support debt owed by Father.3/
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Father's
contentions as follows and affirm.
(1) In his "Statement of Case" section of the opening
brief, Father contends that the Family Court denied him the right
to have a witness speak on his behalf at the hearing on March 30,
2015, or to speak on his own behalf at the hearing on October 26,
2015.  Father, however, does not provide us with the transcripts
of either the March 30 or October 26, 2015 hearings, without
which we are unable to determine the merits of his claim.  See
State v. Hoang , 93 Hawai #i 333, 334, 3 P.3d 499, 500 (2000)
(citing Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai# i 225, 231, 909 P.2d
553, 559 (1995)) ("Without the . . . transcript, the Intermediate
points and address them, to extent that we can, on their merits.  See Marvin
v. Pflueger , 127 Hawai #i 490, 496, 280 P.3d 88, 94 (2012).
3/In the "Statement of Points on Appeal" and the "Statement of
Questions Presented" sections of his opening brief, Father appears to raise as
additional issues that this court failed to (i) inform him of "proper
procedures to pursue [his] case" (by which he appears to mean the process by
which to incorporate hearing transcripts into the appellate record) and (ii)
provide him with "ample time to retrieve the transcripts that were crucial to
[him] to file this very document."  Father, however, did not ask this court
about the transcript process, but had previous experience with the issues
related to obtaining transcripts in support of an appeal.  See State v.
Baptista , CAAP-11-0001084, 2014 WL 114019 (Hawai #i App. Jan. 13, 2014). 
Further, the court is not authorized to provide litigants with legal advice,
the relevant appellate court rule is publicly available, and there are
agencies and avenues both inside and outside the Hawai #i Judiciary where
Father might have gone to obtain such information.  See Rucker v. Air Ventures
Hawaii, LLC, Civil No. 16-00492 KSC, 2017 WL 2805490, at *2 (D. Haw. June 28,
2017) (rejecting pro se litigant's contention that it is the court's job to
counsel and assist the pro se litigant with the prosecution of her case).  As
to the claim of insufficient time, Father sought and obtained four extensions
of time for filing his opening brief, by which he obtained a total of 163
additional days to file his opening brief.  Throughout his motions, Father
explained that he was in the process of consulting with attorneys and in the
process of getting transcripts created.  Those observations notwithstanding,
issues of this sort related to the appellate process are not properly raised
as points of error on appeal in the first instance and are therefore not
addressed further.
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
Court of Appeals did not, and this court does not, have a basis
upon which to review the point of error raised in the present
appeal.").  Because we can not determine the facts or
circumstances surrounding Father's first contention, we are
unable to further review it.4/  See State v. Hamilton, No. CAAP-
15-0000870, 2017 WL 1194170, at *2 (Hawai #i App. March 31, 2017)
(reasoning that "we will not presume error based on a silent
record" (quoting Hoang, 93 Hawai #i at 336, 3 P.3d at 503
(internal quotation marks omitted)) and noting that "we cannot
verify these claims of error by [appellant] without the relevant
transcripts[.]"). 
(2) Father appears to contend that the Family Court did
not have jurisdiction to enter the May 1, 2015 Child Support
Order.  In Hawai #i, the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act
("UIFSA"), codified in HRS Chapter 576B (1997), governs
interstate and foreign child support matters.  See generally 1997
Haw. Sess. Laws Act 295, at 684-703; see also Child Support Enf't
Agency v. Carlin, 96 Hawai# i 373, 376, 31 P.3d 230, 233 (App.
2001) (citing Haw. Rev. Stat. §§ 576B-305(a) and 576B-307) ("The
[U]IFSA authorizes the state responding to an interstate support
petition, in this case Hawai #i, to commence a support proceeding
at the request of the transmitting petitioner in the other
state.").  
Under the UIFSA, the Hawai #i Family Court is the
responding tribunal of this state; see Haw. Rev. Stat. §§ 576B-
102, -203; and therefore is authorized to hear the child support
4/Similarly, Father offers bare allegations in the "Conclusion"
section of his opening brief that "Judge Henry T. Nakamoto and Geraldine
Hasegawa acting on behalf of the Attorney General reveals that these funds go
into state coffers (treasury) with no strings attached[]" and that "Canons 3"
forbids judges and State employees from having a financial interest in a case
they are involved in, "and said must be disqualified and moot under the same
Canons."  Because Father does not explain what "these funds" are, because we
are not presented with transcripts of any instance where Judge Nakamoto or Ms.
Hasegawa revealed anything with regard to the destination of any funds,
because Father refers to no laws or cases holding that state employees are
barred from participating in cases that might result in revenue to the state
general fund, and because Father makes no connection between voluntary and
mandatory disqualification, we do not consider the allegations further.  See
Kakinami v. Kakinami , 127 Hawai #i 126, 144 n.16, 276 P.3d 695, 713 n.16 (2012)
(quoting In re Guardianship of Carlsmith , 113 Hawai #i 236, 246, 151 P.3d 717,
727 (2007) (noting that appellate courts may "disregard a particular
contention if the appellant makes no discernible argument in support of that
position")).

case initiated in Colorado and is authorized to determine the
amount of any arrearage owed by Father and the method of payment. 
See Haw. Rev. Stat. § 576B-305(b)(4).  Because the UIFSA
expressly authorizes the Family Court to determine the
aforementioned, the Family Court had jurisdiction to establish
the child support debt owed by Father and did not abuse its
discretion in issuing the May 1, 2015 Child Support Order. 
Accordingly, the Family Court properly exercised jurisdiction
over the case and in issuing the May 1, 2015 Child Support Order.
Therefore, for the reasons expressed above, the May 1,
2015 Child Support Order is affirmed.
