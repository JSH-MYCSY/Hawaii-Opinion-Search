IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
IN THE INTEREST OF ES
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-S NO. 13-00005)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, and Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Father-Appellant appeals from the Family Court of the
 
First Circuit's ("Family Court's") June 3, 2015 Order Terminating
 
Parental Rights; May 22, 2015 Decision and Order Regarding
 Father's Motion for Relief from Orders Filed February 4, 2014 and
 to Dismiss the Petition Filed July 16, 2014 ("Order Denying
 Relief/Dismissal"); and its May 22, 2015 Decision and Order
 Regarding Father's Motion for Immediate Review Filed April 6,
 2015.
1/ These dispositions essentially terminated Father's
 
parental rights to his child, ES, and awarded permanent custody
 of ES to the Department of Human Services ("DHS"). 
On appeal, Father argues that the Family Court clearly
 
erred and violated his constitutional rights when it denied his
 July 16, 2014 motion for relief from the February 4, 2014 Orders
 Concerning Child Protective Act ("February 4, 2014 Orders"), and
 to dismiss the January 9, 2013 Petition for Temporary Foster
 
1/
 The Honorable Bode A. Uale issued the orders. 
 
Because Father's blanket assertion that the FOFs and COLs are 
erroneous "as [a] whole" does not comport with the requirements set forth in
the Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure ("HRAP"), however, we address only
those findings and conclusions specifically identified for the court. See Haw. 
R. App. P. Rule 28(b)(4) ("Points not presented in accordance with this
section will be disregarded, except that the appellate court, at its option,
may notice a plain error not presented."). Additionally, the opening brief
merely states that the FOFs and COLs that Father does specify are "not
supported for the reasons listed above," yet it fails to expand on this
contention. In fact, Father's argument on the first three points of error
also violates the HRAP because it contains no citations to, or discussions of,
any specific FOFs or COLs alongside their purportedly supporting arguments.
Haw. R. App. P. Rule 28(b)(7) (requiring opening briefs to include "[t]he
argument, containing the contentions of the appellant on the points presented
and the reasons therefor, with citations to the . . . parts of the record 
relied on" (emphasis added)). Moreover, the "reasons listed above" to whichFather refers in his "argument" on the fourth point of error are, for the most
part, not apparent. See id. Accordingly, as discussed below, we deem all
undecipherable arguments with respect to the listed FOFs and COLs to bewaived. See  Kakinami v. Kakinami, 127 Hawai' i 126, 144 n.16, 276 P.3d 695,
713 n.16 (2012) (citing In re Guardianship of Carlsmith, 113 Hawai' i 236, 246,
151 P.3d 717, 727 (2007) explaining that "this court may 'disregard a
particular contention if the appellant makes no discernible argument insupport of that position'").   Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments they advance and the issues they raise, we resolve
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Custody ("July 16, 2014 Motions") on the ground that the court's
 February 22, 2013 Orders Concerning Child Protective Act
 ("February 22, 2013 Orders") awarding foster custody of ES to the
 DHS, were the "law of the case." Specifically, Father contends
 that: (1) DHS did not have probable cause to place ES in
 protective custody in January 2013; (2) the prior judge's ruling
 on the matter was not controlling as the "law of the case"; (3)
 the court should have granted Father's motion to compel testimony
 by hospital nurse Kathryn Martin, formerly known as Kathryn
 Menor, and (4) the Family Court's June 16, 2015 Findings of Fact
 and Conclusions of Law are clearly erroneous and moot."
2/
  
2/
 Father filed an opening brief and an amended opening brief in this
case. In the opening brief, Father "specifically points error in" five
findings of fact ("FOFs"): 18, 93, 115, 116, and 123, and in four conclusionsof law ("COLs"): 9, 10, 11, and 12. In contrast, Father does not raise any ofthe FOFs or COLs in his subsequently filed amended opening brief.Nonetheless, the central issue in this case involves terminating one of
Father's fundamental constitutional rights. See generally, Doe v. Doe, 116
Hawai'i 323, 333-35, 172 P.3d 1067, 1077-79 (2007). Taking into account, then,
the fact that Father raised the FOFs/COLs issue in his first opening brief,
and because of the nature of the fundamental right involved, we proceed toaddress Father's assertions in the first opening brief although they are notproperly preserved. 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Father's points of error as follows, and affirm:
 
(1) On appeal, rather than argue that the Family Court 
was wrong on the merits of his Hawai 'i Family Court Rules 
("HFCR") Rule 60(b) motion for relief from the February 4, 2014 
Orders,3/ Father contends that the Family Court erred by 
premising its decision to deny that motion on the conclusion that the February 22, 2013 Orders constituted the law of the case rather than the testimony and evidence adduced at five days of trial. We disagree and instead conclude that the Family Court did not abuse its discretion for at least three reasons. 
First, it is unclear from the record whether and to
 
what degree the Family Court failed to consider the evidence
 adduced at trial prior to denying Father's HFCR Rule 60(b)
 motion. Father points to the court's May 22, 2015 Order Denying
 Relief/Dismissal which includes: four paragraphs about the
 February 22, 2013 Orders; a fifth paragraph noting that
 "[n]either father or mother motioned the Court for
 reconsideration and neither took an appeal of the Court's
 ruling"; a sixth paragraph concluding that "the Court herein
 finds that Judge Christine Kuriyama's ruling after trial on the
 merits is law of the case"; and a seventh paragraph denying the
 motion. 
That order, however, arose in the context of a five-day
 
trial, during which Father presented witnesses and submitted
 documentary evidence to the Family Court, which Father claimed
 entitled him to reversal of the February 4, 2014 Orders. That
 the Family Court considered the witness testimonies and the other
 evidence appears evident from the many findings and conclusions
 that the court included in its June 16, 2015 Findings of Fact and
 Conclusions of Law. Thus, although FOF 18 states, "Neither
 Mother nor Father filed for reconsideration of the Court's orders
 on February 22, 2013, adjudicating the petition and assuming
 jurisdiction over Mother and Father nor did Mother or Father file
 
3/
 "A motion to set aside a judgment pursuant to HFCR Rule 60(b) is
reviewed for abuse of discretion." Child Support Enf't Agency v. Doe, 98
Hawai'i 499, 503, 51 P.3d 366, 370 (2002) (citing Hayashi v. Hayashi, 4 Haw.
App. 286, 290, 666 P.2d 171, 174 (1983)).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
an appeal[, so] Judge Kuriyama's findings and orders is the law
 
of the case[,]" that finding is but one of 131 findings of fact
 and twelve conclusions of law that address the issues common to
 both Father's motion for relief and DHS's motion for termination
 of parental rights.
4/ Therefore, Father has failed to establish
 
that the Family Court failed to consider the testimony and other
 evidence at trial.
 
Second, Father fails to establish why the February 22, 
2013 Orders should not be considered as law of the case. Father's motion, although directed against the February 4, 2014 Orders, was in fact a belated challenge to the February 22, 2013 Orders. Since Father argued that the court was wrong in coming to its conclusions in the February 22, 2013 Orders, it was his burden to establish error. In re RGB, 123 Hawai
'i 1, 17, 229 
P.3d 1066, 1082 (2010) (quoting State v. Hinton, 120 Hawai 'i 265, 
273, 204 P.3d 484, 492 (2009)). And because Father's July 16, 2014 Motions presented no cogent reasons or exceptional circumstances to support amending the February 22, 2013 Orders or the February 4, 2014 Orders, the Family Court did not err in holding that the February 22, 2013 Orders controlled. See Aoki 
v. Aoki, 105 Hawai
'i 403, 411, 98 P.3d 274, 282 (App. 2004)
 
("[The law-of-the-case doctrine] is not completely
 inflexible, . . . since a judge is allowed to modify a prior
 decision of another judge if either cogent reasons support such a
 modification, or [if] exceptional circumstances are present."
 (citing Tradewinds Hotel, Inc. v. Cochran, 8 Haw. App. 256, 264,
 799 P.2d 60, 66 (1990))).
 
And, finally, even if we were to overlook Father's
 
failure to raise the Rule 60(b) issue on appeal and proceed on
 our own to address the merits of the Family Court's ruling on the
 Rule 60(b) motion,
5/  our conclusion remains the same. That is,
 
4/
 Indeed, as the Family Court noted when it agreed to hear both
matters during the same trial, "it's kinda like two different sides of the
same issue." 
5/
 Father specifically contended that his motion would fall under
HFCR Rule 60(b)(3) or (b)(6). Since Father appears to specifically allege
(continued...)
 
4
  
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
regardless of how the argument is framed, Father's HFCR Rule
 
60(b) motion was untimely because, as a de facto attack on the
 February 22, 2013 Orders, it was not filed "not more than one
 year after the judgment, order, or proceedings was entered or
 
6/
taken."  Haw. F. Ct. R. 60. Thus, FOF 18 is not erroneous, the 
Family Court did not abuse its discretion, and Father's first point of error fails. See generally In re Doe, 95 Hawai
'i 183, 
190, 20 P.3d 616, 623 (2001) ("[T]he family court 'is given much leeway in its examination of the reports concerning a child's care, custody, and welfare, and its conclusions in this regard, if supported by the record and not clearly erroneous, must stand on appeal.'" (brackets omitted) (quoting In re Doe, 89 Hawai
'i 
447, 487, 974 P.2d 1067, 1077 (App. 1999))). 
(2)
 There is also no merit to Father's claim that the 
DHS violated his constitutional rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution by removing ES without probable cause. In fact, Father cites to no authority that supports his assertion that DHS was required to show that it had probable cause to place ES in protective custody before doing so, and we find none. See Kakinami, 127 Hawai
'i at 144 n.16, 276 
P.3d at 713 n.16. Rather, Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 587A-8 (Supp. 2012) sets out the legal standard for protective custody by a police officer without a court order.
7/ 
5/(...continued)
fraud, the claim falls under HFCR Rule 60(b)(3). 
And, as such, it fails.
 
6/
 The effects of the delay in bringing the HFCR Rule 60(b) motion
are evident here where the court was simultaneously considering DHS's motion
for termination of parental rights. Upon the court's granting of DHS's
motion, Father's motion effectively became moot and any error that might have
occurred in the underlying award of foster custody was thereby made harmless.
 
7/
 Section 587A-8 of the HRS states, in relevant part:
 
(a) A police officer shall assume protective custody
of a child without a court order and without the consent of
 the child's family if, in the discretion of the police
officer, the officer determines that:
 
(1)	 The child is subject to imminent harm while in
the custody of the child's family;
 
(2)	 The child has no parent, as defined in this
 
chapter, who is will

Moreover, Honolulu Police Department ("HPD") Officer
 
Gabriel Kira had adequate reasons to assume protective custody
 
under HRS § 587A-8 when he did so shortly after ES's birth. 
Indeed, testimony by Officer Kira established that the officer
 decided to assume protective custody of ES only after consulting
 with Ermalinda Pascua, a DHS Social Worker assigned to ES's
 case.
8/ In one of its unchallenged findings, the Family Court
 
stated that both Pascua and Officer Kira "are found by the Court
 to be credible witnesses," and, in contrast, Father's testimony
 was "not credible". See generally In re Doe  , 107 Hawai
'i 12, 19, 
108 P.3d 966, 973 (2005) (explaining that appellate courts give
 "deference to the right of the trier of fact 'to determine
 credibility, weigh evidence, and draw reasonable inferences
 . . . .'" (quoting State v. Lubong, 77 Hawai
'i 429, 432, 886 P.2d 
766, 769 (App. 1994))). Pascua had informed Officer Kira that:
 Mother had "recently" tested positive for methamphetamine and

amphetamine;  Mother had suffered previous, documented incidents
7/(...continued)
 
safe family home for the child;

 
(3)	 The child has no caregiver, as defined in this
chapter, who is willing and able to provide a
safe and appropriate placement for the child; or
 
(4)	 The child's parent has subjected the child to
harm or threatened harm and the parent is likely
to flee with the child.
 
Haw. Rev. Stat. § 587A-8(a).
 
8/
 Father's contention that it was Pascua, rather than Officer Kira,
who took ES into protective custody, when Pascua instructed hospital staff tokeep ES in the nursery until Pascua and the HPD arrived, is incorrect.Pascua's instructions to hospital staff did not amount to a transfer ofcustody. Officer Kira testified that he assumed protective custody of ES onlyafter arriving at the hospital, at which time he conferred with Pascua andwitnessed first-hand Father's violent and threatening behavior. Therefore,the Family Court issued a finding, which Father does not explicitly challenge
on appeal, stating that: the HPD "assumed police protective custody of [ES,]
and therefore transferred custody to DHS in accordance with HRS § 587A-8."Because this finding is unchallenged, and because Father has presented no
compelling reason to disturb it, we will not do so on appeal. See State v. 
Kiese, 126 Hawai' i 494, 502, 273 P.3d 1180, 1188 (2012) (explaining that FOFs
not challenged on appeal are binding (citing Kelly v. 1250 Oceanside Partners,
111 Hawai' i 205, 227, 140 P.3d 985, 1007 (2006))). 
9/
 In two of its FOFs, the Family Court found that Mother tested
positive for amphetamines during two hospital visits that occurred in the
(continued...)

of relationship violence at Father's hands;10/ and Pascua had
 
observed "Father's [threatening] behavior during the initial
 
removal of [ES]" from the hospital.11/   It is clear from the
 
officer's testimony that he believed that ES was "subject to
 imminent harm" while in Father's custody and/or that ES had "no
 parent . . . who is willing and able to provide a safe family
 home for [ES]."
12/ Haw. Rev. Stat. § 587A-8(a)(1) and (2). 
Therefore, Officer Kira satisfied all applicable standards for
 
9/(...continued)
first half of her pregnancy with ES. 
However, as noted in FOF 31, "Mother did
not test positive for drugs upon admission to the hospital or at delivery of
[ES]." Thus, even though Officer Kira apparently misconstrued Pascua'sstatement to mean that Mother tested positive within a month of delivering ES,rather than testing positive more than three months prior to delivery, theerror was harmless. That is, even if Officer Kira had correctly understoodPascua, Mother's two positive results on her prenatal drug tests, which theFamily Court explained in two of its unchallenged FOFs, still would haveprovided adequate support for the officer's decision to assume protective
custody of ES shortly after the child was born. See Haw. Rev. Stat. § 587A­
8(a)(1) and (2); see also Kiese, 126 Hawai' i at 502, 273 P.3d at 1188. 
10/
 For example, FOFs 7 and 71 establish that during a hospital visit
occurring early on in her pregnancy with ES, Mother presented with injuries
"such as a depressed fracture and swelling under her chin area," and she"reported to hospital staff that Father [had] assaulted her." In FOF 86, thecourt also found that Mother has filed at least one Temporary RestrainingOrder against Father, which remains in effect as of the date of thisdisposition. Based on evidence such as this, the Family Court stated inFOF 96 that "[s]ince the inception of this case in January 2013, there havebeen at least four different incidents of domestic violence between Mother and Father that have either resulted in injuries to Mother or the arrest of Father
or both." Father fails to challenge any of these findings on appeal. See 
Kiese, 126 Hawai' i at 502, 273 P.3d at 1188.  Furthermore, Father has cited to
no authority to support the notion that allegations against a parent must be
adjudicated before a police officer may take the parent's child into
protective custody under HRS § 587A-8, and we find none. See Kakinami, 127 
Hawai'i at 144 n.16, 276 P.3d at 713 n.16. 
11/
 Father does explicitly challenge FOF 93, in which the Family
Court found that "Father exhibited violent and threatening behavior that
necessitated the assistance of additional HPD officers" during the "initialremoval of [ES]." Nonetheless, there is "credible evidence which is ofsufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonablecaution to support" the court's statement in FOF 93, particularly in light of
its unchallenged credibility determinations in FOFs 127 and 129. 2001 Doe, 95
Hawai'i at 190, 20 P.3d at 623 (defining the "clearly erroneous" standard of
review that applies to a family court's FOFs on appeal). Thus, Father's
challenge to FOF 93 fails. 
12/
 According to another one of the Family Court's unchallenged
findings, "[ES] has significant medical needs and is diagnosed with clef[t]
palate, asthma, and cerebral palsy." Further, the record indicates that DHS
initially attempted to place the newborn ES in foster custody of a "relative
resource caregiver," but DHS subsequently removed ES from that placement
"because Father was threatening the resource caregiver . . . ." See Haw. Rev.
 
Stat. § 587A-8(a)(3).
 
7
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
"assum[ing] protective custody of [ES] without a court order and
 
without the consent of [ES]'s family" under HRS § 587A-8(a), and
 as noted above, Father's arguments to the contrary are
 unpersuasive. Accordingly, the second point of error fails. 
(3) The Family Court did not prevent Father from
 
compelling the testimony of Nurse Kathryn Martin. In light of
 the temporary restraining order that Nurse Martin had obtained
 against Father due to concerns for her own safety, however, the
 court allowed Father to secure the evidence by deposing Nurse
 Martin. Father, however, failed to depose Nurse Martin. 
Furthermore, as discussed above, Officer Kira's decision to
 assume protective custody of ES was not based on an allegation
 that ES tested positive for drugs, as Father contends, so any
 error on the part of the Family Court in excusing Nurse Martin
 from testifying regarding her statement that ES tested positive
 for drugs, was harmless. 
(4) Finally, Father advances no discernible argument 
for why this court should depart from any of the remaining FOFs or COLs he challenges on appeal, so we deem those arguments to be waived. Kakinami, 127 Hawai
'i at 144 n.16, 276 P.3d at 713 n.16. 
Moreover, our own review of the record reveals no grounds for concluding that the Family Court's findings in FOFs 115, 116, and 123, which form the basis for COLs 9, 10, and 11, or its conclusion in COL 12 that "[t]he Permanent Plan dated July 10, 2014, is in the best interests of [ES]," were erroneous. See 
2001 Doe, 95 Hawai
'i at 190, 20 P.3d at 623.  Thus, Father's 
challenge to the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law is, like his first three alleged points of error, meritless. See Stanford 
Carr Dev. Corp. v. Unity House, Inc., 111 Hawai
'i 286, 303 n.10, 
141 P.3d 459, 476 n.10 (2006) ("It is axiomatic that '[i]f a finding is not properly attacked, it is binding; and any conclusion which follows from it and is a correct statement of law is valid.'" (quoting Kawamata Farms, Inc. v. United Agric. Prods., 86 Hawai
'i 214, 252, 948 P.2d 1055, 1093 (1997))).
