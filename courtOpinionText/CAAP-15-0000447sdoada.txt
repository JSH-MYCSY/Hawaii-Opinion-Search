APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 12-1-2882)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Chan, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Dianna Nalani Kupahu (Kupahu)
 
appeals 
pro se from the May 21, 2015 "Order Denying Defendant
 
Dianna Nalani Kupahu's Counter Motion for Summary Judgment Filed
 
on February 9, 2015" (Order Denying Counter Motion for Summary
Judgment), entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
 
1
(circuit court) , in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee, Bank of
America, N.A., Successor by Merger to BAC Home Loans Servicing,
 
LP fka Countrywide Home Loans Servicing, LP (BANA). 
On appeal, Kupahu contends that (1) the Hawai
'i Supreme 
Court violated Kupahu's due process right by not issuing a
 mandamus; (2) the Intermediate Court of Appeals violated Kupahu's

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
due process right by not ordering the circuit court judge to
 
issue a final judgment; (3) the circuit court erred by not
 issuing a final judgment; and (4) the circuit court erred by
 failing to review Kupahu's receipts of payment towards her loan. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Kupahu's
 points of errors as follows, and affirm.
 
In regards to points of error one through three, it
 
appears Kupahu is requesting an order that the circuit court
 enter an appealable final judgment on the October 2, 2013
 "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Order Granting Plaintiff's
 Motion for Summary Judgment Against All Parties and for
 Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure Filed May 2, 2013" (Summary
Judgment/Foreclosure Decree) issued by the circuit court.
 
However, as stated in this court's April 20, 2016 "Order Denying
 
March 8, 2016 Motion to Dismiss Appeal for Lack of Appellate
 Jurisdiction," the circuit court entered a judgment (Foreclosure
 
Judgment) pursuant to the Summary Judgment/Foreclosure Decree on
 
October 2, 2013, from which Kupahu failed to timely appeal.
 
Therefore, these points of error are without merit.
 
Additionally, we find Kupahu's fourth point of error is 
also without merit. This court has construed Kupahu's February 9, 2015 "Counter Motion for Summary Judgment" as a non-conforming post-judgment Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 60(b) 
motion for relief (Rule 60(b) Motion) from the October 2, 2013 
Foreclosure Judgment from which she timely appealed. In Kupahu's 
Rule 60(b) Motion, she argues inter alia, that BANA lacked standing to prosecute the foreclosure action based on a purported forensic audit report and that Kupahu was current on her loan payments, and therefore, was not in default of her loan. However, the unsworn "expert opinion" and other exhibits provided did not establish that she was not in default. Furthermore, on appeal, Kupahu makes no argument warranting a conclusion that the circuit court abused its discretion in denying relief under any sub-section of HRCP 60(b) and, upon careful review of the record,

we find none.
 
Accordingly, the circuit court's May 21, 2015 "Order
 
Denying Defendant Dianna Nalani Kupahu's Counter Motion for
 
Summary Judgment Filed on February 9, 2015" is affirmed.
