LANAKILA NILES, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-14-05558)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Lanakila Niles (Niles) appeals from
 
the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment,

 
entered on May 26, 2015, in the District Court of the First
 
1
Circuit, Honolulu Division (district court).  The district court
 
convicted Niles of one count of Operating a Vehicle Under the
 
Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii
 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1) and (3) (Supp. 2015).2

 HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) and (3) (Supp. 2015) provides:
 
§291E-61 Operating a vehicle under the influence of an
intoxicant. (a) A person commits the offense of operating a
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if the person
operates or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle:

On appeal, Niles argues that the district court wrongly 
convicted him because: (1) the charge was fatally defective for 
failing to define "alcohol," Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 291E-1 (2007) and -61 (Supp. 2015) are void for vagueness if they include beverages that do not meet the definition of "alcohol," and the State failed to prove he consumed "alcohol"; (2) the district court violated his constitutional right to testify by engaging him in an insufficient colloquy; (3) Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai
'i (State) failed to lay a sufficient foundation 
for the admission of the Intoxilyzer test results and, thus, there was insufficient evidence to support the OVUII conviction under HRS § 291E-61(a)(3); and (4) the State failed to lay the requisite foundation for admission of testimony regarding his performance on the Standardized Field Sobriety Test (SFST) and, 
thus, there was insufficient evidence to support the OVUII 
conviction under § 291E-61(a)(1). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Niles's points of error as follows.
 
(1) The Complaint was not defective for failing to 
include the definition of "alcohol" set forth in HRS § 291E-1. State v. Turping, 136 Hawai
'i 333, 339, 361 P.3d 1236, 1242 (App. 
2015), cert denied, No. SCWC-13-0002957, 2015 WL 3381360 (May 20, 2015); HRS § 291E-1 (2007). Moreover, HRS §§ 291E-1 and -61 are not void for vagueness because OVUII "includes being under the influence of ethyl alcohol commonly found in beverages such as beer and wine" and "beer and wine are commonly known as alcoholic beverages." State v. Boyd, (SDO) No. CAAP-15-0000528, 2016 WL 
(1)	 While under the influence of alcohol in an
 
amount sufficient to impair the person's normal
mental faculties or ability to care for the
person and guard against casualty; [or]
. . . . 
(3)	 With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two
hundred ten liters of breath[.]

3369242, at *1 (Haw. App. June 15, 2016); see also, State v. 
Tsujimura, 137 Hawai 'i 117, 121-22, 366 P.3d 173, 177-78 (2016) 
cert. granted, No. SCWC-14-0001302, 2016 WL 3569896 (Jun. 24, 2016). Niles's arguments that there was insufficient evidence to prove he consumed alcohol is without merit, as there was evidence that he consumed beer. 
(2) The district court plainly erred by failing to 
obtain a valid on-the-record waiver of Niles's right to testify. See State v. Staley, 91 Hawai
'i 275, 286-87, 982 P.2d 904, 915-16 
(1999). The district court's pre-trial colloquy was deficient for omitting: that Niles had the right to testify; and that, if he did not testify by the end of trial, the court would briefly question him to ensure that the decision not to testify was his own.
3 See State v. Lewis, 94 Hawai 'i 292, 297, 12 P.3d 1233, 
1238 (2000). 
The colloquy during trial was also deficient because 
the district court failed to advise Niles of his right to testify, Tachibana v. State, 79 Hawai
'i 226, 236, 900 P.2d 1293, 
1303 (1995), and if he wanted to testify no one could prevent him from doing so.
4 Id. at 236 n.7, 900 P.2d at 1303 n.7. 
3
 The district court's pre-trial colloquy was as follows:
 
THE COURT: And Mr. Niles, before the State proves
this charge against you I wish to advise you that you have
the right to remain silent. And if you remain silent, I
will not hold that against you.
 
And if you testify, the prosecutor has the opportunity
to cross examine you, you understand?
 
[Niles]: Yes.
4
 The district court's Tachibana colloquy with Niles during trial was
 
as follows:
 
THE COURT: . . . 
Mr. Niles, as I said at the outset, you have the right
to remain silent. If you remain silent I will not hold that
against you. If you testify, the prosecutor has the
opportunity to cross examine you. Do you understand that?

It cannot be said that the district court's violations 
were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, Tachibana, 79 Hawai 'i at 
240, 900 P.2d at 1307, because it is unknowable from the record 
whether any testimony by Niles would have established reasonable doubt that he committed OVUII. State v. Pomroy, 132 Hawai
'i 85, 
94, 319 P.3d 1093, 1102 (2014), as corrected (Jan. 29, 2015); State v. Hoang, 94 Hawai
'i 271, 279, 12 P.3d 371, 379 (App. 
2000). 
Despite our ruling with regard to the Tachibana
 
colloquy, we must proceed to address whether there was sufficient
 evidence to support the convictions. See State v. Spinelli,
 
(SDO) No. CAAP-14-0001357, 2016 WL 937625 at *1 (Haw. App. Mar.
 11, 2016).
 
(3) In light of State v. Won, 137 Hawai
'i 330, 372 P.3d 
1065 (2015), the district court erred in admitting into evidence the results of the Intoxilyzer test. In Won, the Hawai
'i Supreme 
Court held, in similar circumstances, that the defendant's decision to submit to a breath test was not voluntary. Id. at 
355, 372 P.3d at 1090. Like in Won, therefore, the results of Niles's breath test must be suppressed. Without the results of the breath test, there is insufficient evidence to support the conviction under HRS § 291E-61(a)(3). 
(4) Niles contends that the State failed to lay a
 
sufficient foundation for admission of testimony regarding
 
[Niles]: Yes.
 
THE COURT: 
Have you yourself made a decision to
remain silent or take the stand?
 
[Niles]: 
Silent.
 
THE COURT:  
That's your decision?
 
[Niles]:  
Yes.
 
THE COURT: 
Okay. Defense rests?
 
[Niles's Counsel]:  
Defense rests, Your Honor.

Niles's performance on the SFST. In particular, Niles argues the
 
district court erred in allowing Officer Gazelle's "testimony on
 the grading of the SFST based on clues, his opinion that Niles
 had failed and his opinion on [Niles's] state of sobriety and
 inability to safely operate a vehicle." Niles thus contends that
 without such testimony, there was insufficient evidence to
 support his conviction under HRS § 291E-61(a)(1). We do not
 agree.
 
As even Niles acknowledges in his opening brief, 
an arresting officer may be permitted to testify as to his
or her physical observations about a DUI arrestee's
performance on [SFST] tests and to give an opinion, based on
such observations, as to whether the arrestee was
intoxicated when arrested. . . . [H]owever, we conclude that
an arresting officer may not, without a proper foundation
being laid, testify that, in his or her opinion, a DUI
arrestee “failed” the FSTs.
 
State v. Ferrer, 95 Hawai 'i 409, 427, 23 P.3d 744, 762 (App. 
2001). Ferrer further stated that:
 
Pursuant to [State v. Nishi, 9 Haw. App. 516, 852 P.2d 476
(1993)] and [State v. Toyomura, 80 Hawai' i 8, 904 P.2d 893
(1995)], therefore, it is permissible for a police officer
to testify as a lay witness about his or her observations ofa defendant's performance on various FSTs and to give anopinion, based on such observations, that the defendant wasintoxicated. However, unless proper foundation is laid, itis improper for a police officer to testify that in his orher opinion, a defendant “failed” or “passed” a FST. 
Id. at 429, 23 P.3d at 764. Therefore, it was appropriate in
 
this case, at a minimum, to allow Officer Gazelle's testimony
 regarding his observations of Niles as Niles performed the SFST.
 
Moreover, there was testimony from Officer Borges that:
 
he observed Niles on Ala Moana Boulevard drive his vehicle onto a
 sidewalk, narrowly missing a pedestrian; Niles's vehicle
 continued on the sidewalk for quite a distance until it quickly
 swerved onto the roadway, bouncing as it re-entered the roadway;
 after turning onto Ward Avenue, the tire of Niles's vehicle
 crossed over into the lane of oncoming traffic and then Niles
 overcorrected and swerved toward a white line separating his lane
 from the lane in which Officer Borges was driving; after Officer
 Borges stopped Niles, Officer Borges observed, inter alia, Niles

become confused when asked for his car registration which was
 
sitting on his lap, that Niles had red watery eyes, that there
 was a very strong odor of a consumed alcoholic beverage consuming
 the interior of the vehicle, and that Niles had slow slurred
 speech; and when asked if he had been drinking, Niles replied
 that he had two beers.
 
Based on the properly admitted evidence, and viewing
 
such evidence in the strongest light for the prosecution, State
 v. Batson, 73 Haw. 236, 248, 831 P.2d 924, 931 (1992), there was
 sufficient evidence adduced to support the conviction of Niles
 under HRS § 291E-61(a)(1).
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of
 
Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, entered on May
 26, 2015, in the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu
 Division, is vacated and this case is remanded for a new trial on
 the charge of OVUII under HRS § 291E-61(a)(1). However, the
 conviction for OVUII under HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) is reversed.
