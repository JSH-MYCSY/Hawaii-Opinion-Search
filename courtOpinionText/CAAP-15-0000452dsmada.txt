NO. CAAP-15-0000452
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
GIAMPAOLO BOSCHETTI, aka G. PAUL BOSCHETTI,
Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
ERNESTINE K. MARFIL,
Defendant-Appellant,
and
 
HEIRS and/or DEVISEES OF NAPOE(K), et al.,
Defendants-Appellees
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 11-1-0889(1))

 
ORDER GRANTING AUGUST 18, 2015 MOTION
TO DISMISS APPELLATE COURT CASE NUMBER CAAP-15-0000452

 
FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
Upon review of (1) Plaintiff-Appellee Giampaolo
 
Boschetti's (Appellee Boschetti) August 18, 2015 motion to
 
dismiss appellate court case number CAAP-15-0000452 for lack of
 appellate jurisdiction, (2) Defendant-Appellant Ernestine K.
 Marfil's (Appellant Marfil) August 24, 2015 statement of
 jurisdiction, (3) Defendant-Appellee County of Maui's statement
 of no position as to Appellee Boschetti August 18, 2015 motion to
 dismiss, (4) Defendant-Appellee Office of Hawaiian Affairs'
 statement of no opposition to Appellee Boschetti's August 18,
 2015 motion to dismiss, and (5) the record, it appears that we
 lack appellate jurisdiction over the appeal that Appellant Marfil
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
has asserted from the Honorable Rhonda I.L. Loo's May 8, 2015 
judgment, because Appellant Marfil did not file her June 9, 2015 appeal within thirty days after entry of the May 8, 2015 judgment, as Rule 4(a)(1) of the Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) required for a timely appeal from the May 8, 2015 judgment. The failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise of judicial discretion. Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 
P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or justice is authorized to change the jurisdictional requirements contained in Rule 4 of [the HRAP]."). Consequently, we lack appellate jurisdiction over this case. Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellee Boschetti's
 
August 18, 2015 motion to dismiss appellate court case number
 CAAP-15-0000452 for lack of appellate jurisdiction is granted,
 and appellate court case number CAAP-15-0000452 is dismissed.
