OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
JUSTIN A. LAMBERT, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
HONOLULU DIVSION 
(1DTA-14-05039) 
MEMORANDUM OPINION 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Justin A. Lambert (Lambert) appeals 
from the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division's 
(District Court)1 May 15, 2015 Entry of Judgment and/or Order and 
Plea/Judgment (Judgment).  After a bench trial, the District Court convicted Lambert of Count 1, Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1) and/or (b)(1) (2007 and Supp. 2018); and Count 2, Refusal to Submit to Testing, HRS § 291E-68 (Supp. 2014). 
On appeal, Lambert contends that the District Court 
erred by denying a multitude of pre-trial motions and, at the hearing on a motion to suppress evidence, by admitting testimony refreshed from a writing without the proper foundation first being laid.

I. BACKGROUND 
At approximately 3:35 a.m. on October 26, 2014, a 
Honolulu police officer pulled Lambert over after observing his 
vehicle traveling the wrong way on a one-way street.  Upon noticing a strong odor of alcohol, observing that Lambert's eyes were red, glassy, and bloodshot, and that Lambert was slurring his speech, the officer told Lambert that he would be subjected to a Standard Field Sobriety Test (SFST).  Upon exiting the vehicle, Lambert's movements were slow and hesitant, and he was holding on to the vehicle to sustain his balance.  Meanwhile, a second officer arrived, who conducted three SFSTs on Lambert, all of which Lambert failed.  Lambert was arrested without being read his Miranda rights.  At the police station, Lambert refused to submit to a breath or blood test to determine his blood-alcohol level.  He was charged with OVUII and refusal to submit to testing. 
At a hearing on Lambert's eleven pre-trial motions, the 
District Court denied three motions relating to the statutory definition of "alcohol" on the basis of Turping,  denied one 
motion to waive costs of inspecting documents in the prosecution's possession because "this court has consistently denied" such motions, denied four motions relating to discovery without explanation, and without ruling on one of the motions.  Following the testimony of the two officers, the District Court denied the final two motions to suppress after finding "an abundance of evidence to establish there was reasonable suspicion and a basis for probable cause".  Over Lambert's objection, the District Court commenced the trial that same day.  Lambert did not testify.

II. POINTS OF ERROR 
Lambert asserts the District Court erred when it:3 
A. "denied Lambert's motion to suppress his refusal based
on violations of [Miranda, ] his right to an
attorney[,] and his statutory right to counsel under  HRS [§] 803-9[,] as well as having to make a Hobson'schoice." 4
B. "deprived [Lambert] of his right to transcripts ofpretrial motions and conducted the pretrial motions onthe same day as trial." 
C. "denied [Lambert's] motion to dismiss for failure toprovide notice that fermented alcohol is included inthe charge of OVUII even though it is not in thedefinition of alcohol under HRS [§] 291E-1." 
D. "found no [Brady ] violation had occurred when the
prosecution imposed an unconstitutional condition whenit demanded a fee to allow defendant to inspectdiscovery." 
5
E. "denied Lambert's motion to compel general discoverymaterials without having to pay an unauthorized costfor the discovery." 
F. "denied Lambert's motion to compel [Henthorn ] and 
[Giglio ] material regarding the officers." 
76
G. "denied Lambert's motion to compel SFST trainingmaterials for the officers." [and] 
H. "allowed officer Cullen to testify after improperrefreshing of his memory." 
3 Lambert's opening brief does not comply with Hawai #i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4) in that the points on appeal sectioncontains no citations to the record specifying where the alleged errorsoccurred or where they were objected to, nor does it comply with HRAPRule 28(4)(b) subsections (A) or (C), where applicable.  Contemporaneous withthis memorandum opinion, Lambert's counsel will be ordered to show cause whyhe should not be sanctioned for these rule violations.

III. DISCUSSION 
A. The District Court Erred in Denying Lambert's
Motion To Suppress Evidence of Refusal.  
In State v. Wilson, 141 Hawai# i 459, 413 P.3d 363 
(App. 2018) cert. granted, 2018 WL 2949142 (June 13, 2018), we 
reversed a conviction for refusal to consent to breath or blood BAC testing under HRS § 291E-68 because we found that the defendant could not permissibly be prosecuted under HRS § 291E-68 in the wake of State v. Won, 137 Hawai# i
 330, 372 P.3d 1065 
(2015).  In Wilson, we concluded that 
Unlike Won, Wilson did not consent to a breath test,
but rather refused to submit to testing.  Thus, this case is 
factually distinguishable from Won.  However, we concludethat the analysis used by the majority in Won to arrive atits determination that Won's consent was invalid controls our decision in this case. 
In particular, the Won majority observed that in the
absence of a warrant or an exception (besides consent) tothe warrant requirement, the choice presented to Won by theimplied consent form, which required him to surrender eitherhis constitutional right to refuse to be searched or hisconstitutional right to not be arrested for constitutionallyauthorized conduct, rendered his consent to search
involuntary. 
 
. . . . 
Here, the police did not have a warrant to search
Wilson, and based on Won, there was no exception to the
warrant requirement that would permit the police to compelWilson to submit to testing.  In accordance with themajority's analysis in Won, the State could not subjectWilson to criminal punishment for exercising herconstitutional right to refuse to submit to testing. 
141 Hawai# i at 463-64, 413 P.3d at 367-68 (emphases added). 
Therefore, we reverse Lambert's conviction for refusal, and, 
because the District Court's denial of Lambert's Motion to Suppress his refusal to submit to breath testing has no bearing on his conviction under Count 1 for OVUII, we need not address Lambert's first point of error.
B. The District Court Abused Its Discretion by Refusing to
Continue the Trial So that Lambert Could Obtain 
Transcripts of the Pretrial Motions Hearing. 
Lambert contends that he was denied his right to a fair 
trial when the District Court commenced with the trial 
immediately after the pretrial hearing on the motions because it 
4  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
precluded Lambert from obtaining transcripts of the hearing with 
which he could potentially impeach the officers at trial.  "The plain language of [Hawai# i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP)] Rule 
12(e) only requires that a pretrial motion be determined prior to trial, it does not require that pretrial motions be determined on a different day than the trial."
8 State v. Seidl, 139 Hawai# i 
267, 388 P.3d 55, 2016 WL 6879554 at ***2 (App. Nov. 22, 2016) (SDO). 
However, Lambert was entitled to transcripts of prior 
proceedings in his case, State v. Mundon, 121 Hawai# i 339, 357, 
219 P.3d 1126, 1144 (2009) (there is "innate value of transcripts for trial preparation and impeachment purposes and [] a defendant need not show a need for the transcripts 'tailored to the facts of a particular case'"), and he in so many words,  asked to 
continue the trial for that purpose.  Therefore, the District Court abused its discretion when it denied Lambert a continuance of trial to obtain the transcript of his pretrial motion hearing. State v. Williander, 142 Hawai# i
 155,162, 415 P.3d 897, 904 
(2018) (grant/denial of continuance reviewed for abuse of discretion).9
C. The District Court Did Not Err When It Denied Lambert's 
Motions to Dismiss Because the Definition of Alcohol 
Under HRS § 291-E Includes Alcohol Produced ThroughFermentation. 
Lambert filed two motions to dismiss and one motion for 
a bill of particulars that all alleged,  in essence, that 
because the statutory definition of "alcohol" under HRS § 291E-10
8 The appellant in Seidl also contended that the same-day trial
deprived her of the right to obtain transcripts; however, this court did notaddress the issue because the case was remanded for a new trial.  2016 WL 6879554, at ***2 n.3. 
9 Lambert's counsel objected to commencing trial the same day,
stating, "I don't think it would be appropriate to start trial this afternoon"and "so I believe that we cannot proceed without those transcripts." 
10 Again, because his points of error do not specify, it is unclear
from the Opening Brief which of the two motions to dismiss Lambert contendsshould not have been denied, or both. 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
1 does not include alcoholic beverages created by way of 
fermentation, his charge for OVUII that did not so state denied 
Lambert notice that he could be prosecuted on the basis of intoxication from fermented drinks.  The District Court properly denied all three motions relating to the statutory definition of alcohol on the basis of Turping, which held that an OVUII charge is not deficient for failing to allege the statutory definition of "alcohol."  Id. at 335-36, 361 P.3d at 1238-39; see Seidl, 2016 WL 6879554, at ***3. 11
Lambert's argument is one of law, contending that the 
plain language of HRS § 291E-1 precludes any alcoholic beverages that are not the product of distillation, which, under State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai# i 383, 219 P.3d 1170 (2009), would require 
such non-distilled alcohol to be specified in the charge.  Nevertheless, as the Hawai# i 
Supreme Court recently held, the 
meaning of "alcohol" under the same version of HRS § 291E-1 as Lambert was prosecuted "is not limited to alcohol derived from distillation" but, rather, includes beer, wine, and other fermented liquors containing ethanol, and the definition of alcohol comports with its commonly-understood meaning.  State v. Tsujimura, 140 Hawai# i 299, 306, 400 P.3d 500, 507 (2017).  
Therefore, Lambert was not deprived of notice that he could be prosecuted for OVUII from intoxication caused by alcoholic drinks produced by fermentation. 
12 
11 The relevant part of HRS § 291E-1 (2007) in effect at the time of
Lambert's offense provided, 
"Alcohol" means the product of distillation of any fermented
liquid, regardless of whether rectified, whatever may be theorigin thereof, and includes ethyl alcohol, lower aliphaticalcohol, and phenol as well as synthetic ethyl alcohol, butnot denatured or other alcohol that is considered not potable under the customs laws of the United States. 
12 The year prior to the Tsujimura decision, the Legislature
simplified the definition of alcohol to "ethanol or any substance containingethanol."  2016 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 231, § 59, at 766.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
    D.–G. The District Court Failed to State Its Essential 
Findings In Support of Its Denial of Lambert's
Discovery-Related Motions. 
Lambert's points of error D, E, F, and G concern 
discovery issues.   In points of error D and E, Lambert asserts 
that it was unconstitutional for the State to require that he pay 
to inspect--rather than accepting prosecutor-produced photocopies of--discovery materials that the State has an obligation to disclose under Brady and HRPP Rule 16,  and 16.1 . 
15 1413
13 Lambert contends that the following motions, relating to discovery
and filed December 29, 2014, were wrongly denied:  Motion to Dismiss for Brady
Violation re Unconstitutional Condition; Motion to Compel Prosecution to AllowExercise of HRPP Rules Including Inspection of General and Specific BradyMaterials Without Cost Pursuant to HRPP Rules 16(b)(1)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv),(v), (vii), 16(b)(2), 16(d), 16(e)(1), (2), (3), 16.1, Rules of the DistrictCourts of the State of Hawaii, Rule 33(a); Motion to Compel Specific BradyMaterial-Background Checks; and Motion to Compel Toyomura Records. 
14 HRPP Rule 16(b) provides, in relevant part, 
(b) Disclosure by the Prosecution. 
(1) DISCLOSURE OF MATTERS WITHIN PROSECUTION 'S POSSESSION .  The 
prosecutor shall disclose to the defendant or the
defendant's attorney the following material and informationwithin the prosecutor's possession or control: 
(i) the names and last known addresses of
persons whom the prosecutor intends to call aswitnesses in the presentation of the evidence inchief, together with any relevant written or recordedstatements, provided that statements recorded by theprosecutor shall not be subject to disclosure; 
(ii) any written or recorded statements and the
substance of any oral statements made by thedefendant, or made by a co-defendant if intended to beused in a joint trial, together with the names andlast known addresses of persons who witnessed themaking of such statements; 
(iii) any reports or statements of experts,
which were made in connection with the particular caseor which the prosecutor intends to introduce, or whichare material to the preparation of the defense and arespecifically designated in writing by defense counsel,including results of physical or mental examinationsand of scientific tests, experiments, or comparisons; 
(iv) any books, papers, documents, photographs,
or tangible objects which the prosecutor intends tointroduce, or which were obtained from or which belongto the defendant, or which are material to thepreparation of the defense and are specificallydesignated in writing by defense counsel;

We have held that, "while it may be permissible for the 
State to charge a defendant for copying costs where the defendant 
requests copies of materials subject to disclosure, the State cannot condition the disclosure of Brady material or discovery on the payment for copies that the defendant only seeks to view." Seidl, 2016 WL 6879554, at ***3 (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting State v. Yoshimoto, 137 Hawai# i 206, 366 
P.3d 1085, No. CAAP-14-0000896, 2016 WL 383169, at *2 (App. Jan. 29, 2016) (SDO)); see also State v. Woods, 138 Hawai# i

(v) a copy of any Hawai #i criminal record of the 
defendant and, if so ordered by the court, a copy of
any criminal record of the defendant outside the Stateof Hawai #i; 
(vi) whether there has been any electronic
surveillance (including wiretapping) of conversationsto which the defendant was a party or occurring on thedefendant's premises; and 
(vii) any material or information which tends to
negate the guilt of the defendant as to the offensecharged or would tend to reduce the defendant'spunishment therefor. 
(2) D
ISCLOSURE OF MATTERS NOT WITHIN PROSECUTION 'S POSSESSION .  
Upon written request of defense counsel and specific
designation by defense counsel of material or informationwhich would be discoverable if in the possession or controlof the prosecutor and which is in the possession or controlof other governmental personnel, the prosecutor shall usediligent good faith efforts to cause such material orinformation to be made available to defense counsel; and ifthe prosecutor's efforts are unsuccessful the court shall issue suitable subpoenas or orders to cause such material orinformation to be made available to defense counsel. 
(Emphasis added.) 
15 HRPP Rule 16.1, "Discovery Procedures for Non-Felony Criminal and
Criminal Traffic Cases,"  provides, 
(a) Applicability.   This rule shall apply to
non-felony criminal and criminal traffic cases. 
(b) Request for Discovery.   If discovery is sought of
materials that would be discoverable in felony casespursuant to these rules, a request for discovery shall bemade to the opposing side in writing and shall list thespecific materials being sought.  Unless otherwise ordered,the request shall not be filed with the court. 
(c) Motion to Compel Discovery.  A party may file a
motion to compel discovery if a timely request for discoverywas made, unless otherwise ordered by the court.

No. CAAP-14-0000765, 2015 WL 7575334 (App. Nov. 25, 2015) (SDO). 
The record does not indicate the specific materials Lambert sought, or those materials the State proffered copies for a fee; thus, there is no basis on which to determine whether the requested materials qualify as Brady or otherwise discoverable materials.  Consequently, on remand, the District Court must determine--on the record--whether Lambert is entitled to disclosure of the subject materials under Brady and the extent to which Lambert is otherwise entitled to discovery under HRPP Rules 16(d) and 16.1.  See Seidl, 2016 WL 6879554, at ***4; Yoshimoto, 2016 WL 383169, *2; Rollison, 2015 WL 7575334, *2. 
In points of error F and G, Lambert contends that the 
District Court erred in denying his motions to compel the State to provide Henthorn and Giglio materials regarding the police officers' disciplinary and training records.  "The scope of discovery is reviewed for an abuse of discretion"  State v. Estrada, 69 Haw. 204, 216, 738 P.2d 812, 821 (1987) (citation omitted).  "A trial court abuses its discretion when it 'clearly exceed[s] the bounds of reason or has disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant.'"  State v. Garcia, 135 Hawai# i 361, 368, 351 
P.3d 588, 595 (2015) (quoting State v. Merino, 81 
Hawai# i 198, 
211, 915 P.2d 672, 685 (1996)). 
Here, the record does not reflect the State's response 
to Lambert's motion to compel Henthorn and Giglio materials, and we see nothing in the record indicating that the District Court ruled on this motion.  Consequently, we remand for the District Court's ruling on Lambert's motion.  See Seidl, 2016 WL 6879554, at ***4; Yoshimoto, 2016 WL 383169 at *2; Rollison, 2015 WL 7575334 at *2. 
H. 
The Refreshing of the Officer's Memory Was Proper. 
Lambert contends that one officer's testimony regarding 
the SFSTs was improperly admitted because the prosecution failed 
to lay a proper foundation to refresh the officer's memory.  As previously noted, Lambert's point of error does not provide a citation to the record for where the alleged error occurred. However, in his argument he references the refreshing of memory 
9  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
during the pretrial hearing on the motions to suppress for lack 
of reasonable suspicion and probable cause. 
A witness's memory may be refreshed by reviewing a 
writing, Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 612,  but the 
subsequent testimony is admissible only upon a showing that the witness's memory was actually refreshed through the laying of proper foundation.  State v. Wakamoto, 143 Hawai# i 443, 451, 431 
P.3d 816, 824 (2018).  16
Here, the contested refreshing of the officer's memory 
occurred during a pretrial hearing on a motion to suppress, and the testimony was not incorporated into the trial.  "Preliminary questions concerning . . . the admissibility of evidence shall be determined by the court[.]  In making its determination[,] the court is not bound by the rules of evidence except those with respect to privileges."  HRE Rule 104(a) (emphasis added); see also, United States v. Ocampo, 650 F.2d 421, 427 (2nd Cir. 1981) ("a court, in conducting a hearing to determine the legality of a warrantless search or seizure, is not bound by strict rules of evidence") (citation omitted). 
In any event, a proper foundation was laid.  Initially, 
we note Lambert cites no case authority for his contention that there are eleven specific questions the attorney must ask before the officer's testimony is admissible.
17  Instead, it appears 
16 HRE Rule 612 provides, in part, 
If a witness uses a writing to refresh the witness' memory
for the purpose of testifying, either: 
(1) While testifying, or 
(2) Before testifying, if the court in itsdiscretion determines it is necessary in theinterests of justice, 
an adverse party is entitled to have the writing produced atthe hearing, to inspect it, to cross-examine the witnessthereon, and to introduce in evidence those portions whichrelate to the testimony of the witness[.] 
17 Lambert contends that the following questions must be asked for
proper foundation: 
First, ask the witness if he had personal knowledge of theevents at one time.  Next, ask if he recorded thatinformation in a document.  Third, you must establish thatthe events were still fresh in his mind when he made the 
(continued...) 
10  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that Lambert is confusing the foundational requirements of 
refreshing a memory with those for admitting an exhibit under the past recollection recorded exception to the hearsay rule.  See HRE Rule 802.1(4).  Refreshing of a witness's memory requires less in terms of foundation than past recollection recorded. 
When used to refresh the witness's present recollection, a
writing is solely employed to jog the memory of thetestifying witness.  1 J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence § 9, at 29 (4th ed.1992).  Accordingly, when a writing is used torefresh a witness's recollection, the witness should testifyfrom "a memory thus revived," resulting in testimony frompresent recollection, not a memory of the writing itself.Id.  "A witness's recollection must be revived after he or she consults the particular writing or object offered as astimulus so that . . . the resulting testimony relates to apresent recollection."  3 J. Weinstein & M. Berger,Weinstein's Evidence ¶ 612 [01], at 612–16 (1995). 
State v. Ferrer, 95 Hawai# i 409, 432–33, 23 P.3d 744, 767–68 
(App. 2001).  In refreshing of memory, the witness is instructed 
to read the writing to him- or herself, and then is asked if his or her memory is refreshed prior to continuing the testimony. Wakamoto, 143 
Hawai# i at 452, 431 P.3d at 825.  In Dibenedetto, 
we held that an officer's memory had not been properly refreshed because he had no memory of the circumstances surrounding the events until he reviewed his own writing, and he even testified that his testimony was based only on the report and not his memory.  State v. Dibenedetto, 80 Hawai# i 138, 141, 906 P.2d 624, 
627 (App. 1995).  
Unlike in Dibenedetto, the officer here had testified 
in detail what he remembered of Lambert's look, demeanor, and performance in the first SFST.  The officer remembered the manner in which he had told Lambert to stand while being instructed on the second test, but he could not remember whether Lambert maintained the position throughout this instruction period.  
17(...continued)
document.  Fourth, ask the witness if he recognizes the 
document.  Ascertain how the witness can recognize the document.  Have the witness identify the document.  Get the witness to explain why he was able to remember theinformation at the time the document was created and the steps he took to make sure that information was accuratelyrecorded in his document.  Have the witness examine the document in an effort to refresh his memory.  Ascertain that the witness' [sic] memory has been refreshed.  Ask if the witness can now remember the answer to the question that wasoriginally asked and if he says yes, then repeat thequestion and obtain the answer. 
11 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Once the officer reviewed his test report, he affirmed that he 
recognized the report because it was in his own handwriting and bearing his own signature, and he answered affirmatively that his memory had been refreshed.  The officer then testified in detail as to Lambert's other two tests. 
In other words, the officer remembered details 
concerning the SFSTs, which were the basis for his belief that Lambert was not sober, and the only part he needed to refresh his memory was the time period between two of the tests.  Thus, "given that prior to having his recollection refreshed, [the officer] remembered significant details about the incident, such as what he observed when he arrived on the scene and talked to [the defendant], it is reasonable to infer that the SFST report merely jogged his memory."  State v. Nakamitsu, 138 Hawai# i 51, 
375 P.3d 1289, No. CAAP-14-0001151, 2016 WL 381475, at *12 (App. Jan. 29, 2016); see State v. Espiritu, 117 
Hawai# i 127, 137, 176 
P.3d 885, 895 (2008) (holding that the witness's memory was properly refreshed when he "accurately recalled the gist or the general nature of each text message prior to viewing the police report" for the exact wording).  Consequently, the officer's memory was properly refreshed with adequate foundation.
IV. CONCLUSION 
The May 15, 2015 Judgment is reversed in part and 
vacated in part.  The conviction and sentence in Count 2 is reversed.  The conviction and sentence as to Count 1 is vacated and the count is remanded for the District Court to rule on Lambert's December 29, 2014 (1) Motion to Dismiss for Brady Violation re Unconstitutional Condition; (2) Motion to Compel Prosecution to Allow Exercise of HRPP Rules Including Inspection of General and Specific Brady Materials Without Cost Pursuant to HRPP Rules 16(b)(1)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vii), 16(b)(2), 16(d), 16(e)(1), (2), (3), 16.1, Rules of the District Courts of the State of Hawaii, Rule 33(a); (3) Motion to Compel Specific Brady Material-Background Checks; and (4) Motion to Compel
