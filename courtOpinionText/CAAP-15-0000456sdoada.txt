v. 
QUOC V. TRAN, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
HONOLULU DIVISION 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-14-04365) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Quoc V. Tran (Tran) appeals from 
the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment 
(
Judgment) entered by the District Court of the First Circuit, 
Honolulu Division (District Court)  on May 18, 2015.  Tran was 
convicted of Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an 
Intoxicant (OVUII) in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 
ยง 291E-61(a)(1) (Supp. 2013).   For the reasons explained below, 
we vacate the Judgment and remand for further proceedings 
consistent with this order. 21
1 The Honorable David W. Lo presided. 
2 HRS ยง 291E-61 provides, in pertinent part: 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if the person
operates or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle: 
(1) While under the influence of alcohol in an amount sufficient to impair the person's normal mentalfaculties or ability to care for the person and guardagainst casualty[.] NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On September 30, 2014, Tran was charged by complaint 
with OVUII based on events that happened on September 14, 2014. 
He pleaded not guilty.  On November 3, 2014, he filed requests 
for Brady3 material.  On January 26, 2015, he filed a number of 
pretrial motions.  The motions were heard on May 18, 2015, and a trial was held immediately thereafter.  He was found guilty as 
charged.  This appeal followed. 
Tran raises seven points of error: 
A. Tran contends that the District Court erred by 
(1) conducting his trial on the same day his pretrial motions 
were heard and (2) denying him transcripts of the hearing on the 
pretrial motions.  Hawai# i
 Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 
12(e) (2007) states: 
Ruling on motion.  A motion made before trial shall be 
determined before trial unless the court orders that it be deferred for determination at the trial of the general issueor until after verdict; provided that a motion to suppressmade before trial shall be determined before trial.  Where factual issues are involved in determining a motion, thecourt shall state its essential findings on the record. 
Tran cites State v. Thomas, 72 Haw. 48, 805 P.2d 1212 (1991) and 
State v. Rodgers, 70 Haw. 156, 766 P.2d 675 (1988).  In Thomas 
the supreme court specifically found the record "to be unclear[,] 
and it is therefore difficult to determine whether HRPP Rule 
12(e) was complied with."  72 Haw. at 54, 805 P.2d at 1214.  In 
Rodgers the "trial judge lumped together the hearing on the 
motion to suppress and the trial[.]"  70 Haw. at 157, 766 P.2d at 
675.   In this case the record is clear that the District Court 
denied Tran's motion to suppress after conducting an evidentiary 4
3 See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). 
4 Footnote 32 in Tran's amended opening brief states that the
Judgment should be reversed because the District Court "failed to articulate
its reasoning, findings, [sic] for the denial of the motion[] to suppress[.]" We decline to address this issue because Tran's points of error fail tochallenge the denial of the motion to suppress.  Hawai #i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure ( HRAP ) Rule 28(b)(4) (2016).

hearing, gave Tran the Tachibana  advisory, called a five-minute 
recess (which lasted twelve minutes), and then started the trial. 
HRPP Rule 12(e) does not require that pretrial motions be heard 
on a different day than the trial.  State v. Rollison, No. CAAP-
14-0000765, 2015 WL 7575334, at *1 (Haw. App. Nov. 25, 2015) 
(SDO).  There was no Rule 12(e) violation. 5
Tran also contends that the District Court denied him 
the right to obtain a transcript of the arresting officer's 
testimony given during the hearing on the motion to suppress to 
prepare for cross-examination of, and to impeach, the same 
officer at trial.  He cites State v. Scott, 131 Hawai# i 333, 319 
P.3d 252 (2013), without discussion.  In Scott, Scott and his brother were separately indicted on multiple charges arising from 
the same fight.  Scott's brother was convicted by a jury.  Before 
Scott's own, separate trial, the State gave notice that it 
intended to introduce evidence that Scott was assisted by his 
brother in assaulting the victims.  Scott moved to continue his 
trial to obtain transcripts of the complaining witnesses' 
testimony from his brother's trial.  The trial court denied the 
motion.  Scott was convicted.  On appeal, the supreme court 
stated that "a codefendant's transcript [from a separate trial] 
is essential to the development of an effective defense in cases 
where the defendant and codefendant's charges arise from the same 
event and involve the same issues and witnesses."  Id. at 341, 
319 P.3d at 260 (cleaned up).

In this case, Tran did not request a continuance of his 
trial to allow him to obtain a transcript of the hearing on his 
5 Tachibana v. State, 79 Hawai #i 226, 900 P.2d 1293 (1995).

extraneous material (e.g., internal brackets, ellipses, quotation marks,
citations, footnote reference numbers, and changes in capitalization) has beenremoved from a quotation for readability, and that none of it matters forunderstanding the quotation or evaluating its weight.  See Metzler, Jack,Cleaning Up Quotations, 18 J. App. Prac. & Process 143, 147, 154 (2017).

motion to suppress.   The same lawyer represented Tran during the 
hearing on the motion to suppress and during the trial the same 
day.  Under those circumstances, the Scott court noted: "defense 
counsel would have been present during the defendant's prior 
trial proceedings and therefore would have been aware of the 
strategies employed by the State and any inconsistencies in the 
witness's statements."  Id. at 341, 319 P.3d at 260.  Only one 
witness (the arresting officer) testified during Tran's motion to 
suppress hearing, and the same witness was the State's only 
witness during the trial.  Under these circumstances, including 
that Tran did not request a trial continuance, Tran has not 
established any error by the District Court. 7
B. Tran's contention that the District Court erred by 
denying his motion to dismiss based on the definition of "alcohol" in HRS ยง 291E-1 (2007) is without merit.  State v. 
Tsujimura, 140 Hawai# i 299, 309, 400 P.3d 500, 510 (2017) 
7 During the hearing on Tran's motion to suppress, the following
exchange took place: 
THE COURT:  All right. Any --
[PROSECUTOR]:  And with regard to this hearing on the
motion then, the State rests. 
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  Request transcripts -- well,
ruling first, um, Your Honor. 
THE COURT:  All right.  Based on the evidence 
presented by the State, motion -- the motion to suppress is
hereby denied. 
[PROSECUTOR]:  Thank you, Your Honor. 
THE COURT: All right.  State may arraign the defendant
at this time. He can remain seated if he wishes. 
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  Thank you. THE COURT: Or unless defendant waives. [DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  We'll waive. [PROSECUTOR]:  Oh, okay. 
The District Court then proceeded with the Tachibana dialogue, took a recess,
and commenced the trial.  Tran did not request a trial continuance to obtaintranscripts of the suppression hearing.

(Holding that "even without the statutory definition of 
'alcohol,' the complaint 'fully defines the offense in 
unmistakable terms,' is 'readily comprehensible to persons of 
common understanding,' and is, therefore, sufficient.") (citation 
omitted). 
C. and D.  These points of error underscore the 
deficiencies in Tran's opening brief and amended opening brief. Although not entirely clear, it appears to the court that point 
"C" challenges the District Court's denial of "Defendant's Motion 
to Compel Prosecution to Allow Exercise of HRPP Rules Including 
Inspection of General and Specific Brady Materials Without 
Cost[.]"  Tran's citation to the transcript refers to a "motion 
to compel without cost."  The State's answering brief, however, 
suggests the State understands point "C" to be directed at the 
District Court's denial of  "Defendant's Motion to Dismiss for 
Brady Violation re Unconstitutional Condition," 
which actually appears to be the subject of Tran's point "D." 
Both pretrial motions arose from Tran's request for 
production of what he characterized as Brady material.  Tran 
claims he was informed that the State was ready to produce Brady 
material but, when his lawyer appeared for the production, the 
State told him he could see the material only after Tran paid for 
copying costs.  Tran also contends that the State would charge 
him $0.50 for the first page and $0.25 for each page thereafter, 
even though he could scan the documents on the Public Defender's 
machine located at the Honolulu Prosecutor's office for only 
$0.10 per page.  Tran did not take steps to ensure that the 
contested materials were included in the record on appeal. 
The State argued that the material sought by Tran did 
not tend to negate Tran's guilt, and was therefore not subject to 
Brady.  We have no basis upon which to determine whether the 
disputed information qualifies as Brady material.  Nor does the 
record indicate whether that was the sole basis for the State's 
non-disclosure, or whether the State also refused to allow Tran 
to make his own determination of whether the disputed information 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
qualifies as Brady material by refusing to produce the 
"approximately 30 cases of discovery" because Tran refused to pay 
the State's copying costs. 
The State agrees that Tran's motions raised factual 
issues and that the District Court denied Tran's motions without 
stating its essential findings on the record in accordance with 
HRPP Rule 12(e) ("Where factual issues are involved in 
determining a motion, the court shall state its essential 
findings on the record.").  Accordingly, we vacate the District 
Court's oral orders and remand to the District Court for a 
determination of whether Tran is entitled to disclosure of any 
challenged material under Brady and, if so, whether the State 
incorrectly conditioned disclosure upon Tran's payment of copying 
costs.  Rollison, 2015 WL 7575334 at *2-3. 
E. Tran contends that the District Court erred by 
denying his motion to compel production of what he refers to as "Henthorn and Giglio material."  The State was able to decipher 
this to be referring to "Defendant's Motion to Compel Specific 
Brady Material โ Background Checks."  Tran requested production 
of the personnel files of the police officers who would testify 
at his trial.  The District Court orally denied the motion. 
In United States v. Henthorn, 931 F.2d 29 (9th Cir. 
1991), the court of appeals recited "the procedure the 
prosecution must follow when confronted with a request by a 
defendant for the personnel files of testifying officers."  Id. 
at 30 (citation omitted).  "The government must disclose 
information favorable to the defense that meets the appropriate 
standard of materiality [i.e., whether the suppressed evidence 
creates a reasonable doubt that did not otherwise exist].  If the 
prosecution is uncertain about the materiality of information 
within its possession, it may submit the information to the trial 
court for an in camera inspection and evaluation."  Id. at 30-31 
(cleaned up).  The State agrees that the disposition of Tran's 
motion required factual determinations that the District Court 
did not state on the record.  Accordingly, we vacate the District 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Court's oral order and remand for the District Court to determine 
whether Tran is entitled to disclosure of any challenged material 
under Henthorn.  Rollison, 2015 WL 7575334 at *2-3. 
F. Tran contends that the District Court erred by 
denying his "motion to compel SFST training materials[.]"  Tran's statement of points does not identify where in the record on 
appeal the motion is located.  Tran's argument cites to the 
District Court's oral order denying Tran's motion to compel 
Toyomura material, but does not identify where in the record on 
appeal the Toyomura motion is located.  We are not obligated to 
search the record for information that should have been provided 
by Tran.  Hawaii Ventures v. Otaka, Inc., 114 Hawai# i 438, 480, 
164 P.3d 696, 738 (2007) (citing Lanai Co. v. Land Use Comm'n, 105 Hawai 
#i 296, 309 n.31, 97 P.3d 372, 385 n.31 (2004) and 
Miyamoto v. Lum, 104 Hawai# i 1, 11 n.14, 84 P.3d 509, 519 n.14 
(2004)). 
The State "guesses that Tran is referring to his Motion 
to Compel Toyomura Records."  That motion did seek discovery of 
the arresting officer's NHTSA SFST training, citing State v. 
Toyomura, 80 Hawai# i 8, 904 P.2d 893 (1995), in which the supreme 
court held that "a police officer may not testify, without proper foundation, about [the officer's] opinion about whether a DUI 
defendant is intoxicated based on FSTs." Id. at 26, 904 P.2d at 
911 (cleaned up).  The State contends that if its guess is 
correct, the disposition of the motion required factual 
determinations that the District Court did not state on the 
record.  The State's guess appears to be correct; accordingly, we 
vacate the District Court's oral order and remand for the 
District Court to determine whether Tran is entitled to 
disclosure of any SFST training material.  Rollison, 2015 WL 
7575334 at *2-3. 
G. Tran's final point of error argues that the 
District Court allowed the arresting officer to testify despite the State's improper attempts to refresh his recollection.  We 
apply the "right/wrong" standard in determining the correctness 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of a ruling regarding the admissibility of testimony under Hawaii 
Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 612 (1993).  State v. Wakamoto, 143 
Hawai# i 443, 450, 431 P.3d 816, 823 (2018).  "[A]fter reviewing a 
writing while testifying, testimony of the witness laying a 
foundation that the witness's memory has actually been refreshed 
after reviewing the writing is required before the witness's 
testimony can be admitted under HRE Rule 612."  Id. at 452, 431 
P.3d at 825.  In this case, in each instance where the arresting 
officer read his report to refresh his recollection, the 
prosecutor failed to ask the officer whether his recollection had 
been refreshed before soliciting the officer's response to the 
outstanding question.  But Tran's attorney did not object and 
never moved to strike the officer's testimony.  Tran's objections 
were waived.  State v. Vliet, 91 Hawai
#i 288, 298-99, 983 P.2d 
189, 199-200 (1999) (noting that HRE Rule 103(a)(1) (2013) requires a specific objection or motion to strike and a "complete 
failure to object will waive the point"). 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the Judgment and 
remand for further proceedings consistent with this order.
