On April 14, 2015, upon a motion by Fukuoka, the 
District Court dismissed all charges without prejudice for 
violation of Rule 48(b) of the Hawai 'i Rules of Penal Procedure 
(HRPP).2 
On appeal, Fukuoka contends the District Court erred by
 
dismissing the charges without prejudice instead of with
 prejudice.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Fukuoka's point of error as follows:
 
In State v. Estencion, 63 Haw. 264, 625 P.2d 1040
 
(1981), the supreme court mandated that "the seriousness of the
 offense; the facts and the circumstances of the case which led to
 the dismissal; and the impact of a reprosecution on the
 administration of this chapter and on the administration of
 justice" be considered in deciding whether to dismiss a case with
 or without prejudice. Id., at 269, 625 P.2d at 1044 (citation
 
omitted). "A trial court's ruling on a motion to dismiss an
 indictment is reviewed for an abuse of discretion." State v.
 
Mendonca, 68 Haw. 280, 283, 711 P.2d 731, 734 (1985). 
2
 HRPP Rule 48(b) provides, in pertinent part:
 
(b) By court. Except in the case of traffic offenses that
are not punishable by imprisonment, the court shall, on
motion of the defendant, dismiss the charge, with or without
prejudice in its discretion, if trial is not commenced
within 6 months:
 
(1) 	from the date of arrest if bail is set or from
 
the filing of the charge, whichever is sooner,
on any offense based on the same conduct or
arising from the same criminal episode for which
the arrest or charge was made; or
 
(2) 	from the date of re-arrest or re-filing of the
charge, in cases where an initial charge was
dismissed upon motion of the defendant; or
 
(3) 	from the date of mistrial, order granting a new
trial or remand, in cases where such events
require a new trial.

 Although Fukuoka appealed from the order denying his motion for
reconsideration, he did not challenge this order in his points on appeal nordid he present any argument stating why the order was entered in error.Therefore, he has waived any challenge to the May 26, 2015 Order denying hismotion. Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(4), and (7).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On appeal, Fukuoka argues that the offenses charged are not
 
serious under the Estencion analysis.
 
Fukuoka cites federal cases which hold that
 
misdemeanors are not considered serious offenses for purposes of
 the Speedy Trial Act. Thus, Fukuoka argues that since the
 charges against him were petty misdemeanors, the District Court
 erred by holding that the charges were serious under its
 Estencion analysis. Fukuoka also claims that numerous courts
 have ruled that using the maximum punishment prescribed by
 statute is the proper measure of the severity of the crime under
 the Speedy Trial Act. However, Fukuoka has failed to present any
 authority supporting the proposition that possible penalty alone
 determines whether a crime is serious for HRPP Rule 48 purposes,
 and we find none.
 
Prior to the enactment of HRS Chapter 291E in 2000, HRS 
§ 291-4 defined the offense of Driving Under the Influence of Intoxicating Liquor (DUI). State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai
'i 383, 
392-93 n.11, 219 P.3d 1170, 1179-80 n.11 (2009). In State v. Leatiota, 69 Haw. 253, 739 P.2d 930 (1987), the court held that the offense of DUI was not subject to the time limitations of HRPP Rule 48 because it was deemed a traffic offense. Yet, the court stated that although the offense was exempted by statute, it was nonetheless "a serious crime." Id. 
In State v. Nakata, 76 Hawai
'i 360, 374, 878 P.2d 699, 
713 (1994), the court held that defendants charged with violating HRS § 291-4 for the first time were not entitled to a jury trial because it was a "constitutionally petty offense." 
However in State v. Lau, 78 Hawai
'i 54, 62, 890 P.2d 
291, 299 (1995) the court held that a charge of DUI under HRS § 291-4 fell within the scope of HRPP Rule 48, reversing Leatiota. The court held that the purpose of HRPP Rule 48 was to ensure the speedy resolution of cases where a person is charged with a criminal offense and subject to a possible term of imprisonment. Id. at 60, 890 P.2d at 297. Thus, HRPP Rule 48 
was made applicable to a traffic offense where there was a possibility of imprisonment. Id. at 61, 890 P.2d at 298. 
However, "HRPP Rule 48 is 'separate and distinct' from its 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
constitutional counterparts.'" Id. "A violation of HRPP Rule 48
 
entitles the defendants to have the trial court dismiss the
 
charges against them with or without prejudice." Id. at 62, 890
 
P.2d at 299 (internal quotation marks omitted). Whereas, the
 only remedy for a violation of a defendant's constitutional right
 to a speedy trial is dismissal with prejudice. Id.
 
Nakata and Lau demonstrate that the seriousness of an
 
offense with respect to HRPP Rule 48 is not related to whether
 the offense is constitutionally petty. Lau specifically included
 
a first time DUI within the scope of HRPP Rule 48 after Nakata
 precluded the right to a jury trial for the same offense. A
 violation of HRPP Rule 48 is not equivalent to a violation of a
 constitutional right to speedy trial. Thus, the fact that an
 offense is constitutionally petty does not determine whether an
 offense is serious under Estencion.
 
In State v. Kim, 109 Hawai
'i 59, 66, 122 P.3d 1157, 
1164 (App. 2005), this court affirmed the dismissal of a felony charge without prejudice for violation of HRPP Rule 48. Citing United States v. Pierce, 17 F.3d 146, 149 (6th Cir. 1994), this court held that the trial court reasonably considered the Estencion factors and properly balanced them when it rejected the defendant's claims that a class C felony was not a serious offense. Id. at 62-64, 122 P.3d at 1160-62. In Pierce, the court rejected the defendant's argument
 
that the federal sentencing guidelines should be used to
 determine whether or not the offense was "serious" for a
 violation of the Speedy Trial Act by stating:
 
While a primary method of judging the seriousness of
an offense is by comparing it to other crimes, that
does not mean that a mechanical test based upon the
Guidelines must be used to label an offense "serious"
 or "not serious." Rather, the Speedy Trial Act's
requirement that courts must consider "the seriousness
of the offense" simply demands that the gravity of the
crime be carefully considered as a factor in deciding
whether to dismiss without prejudice. There are many
crimes more serious than Pierce's income tax evasion,
as well as many less serious. The district court
reasonably considered this factor and properly
balanced it with the other factors.
 
Pierce, 17 F.3d at 148-49.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Similar to Pierce, Fukuoka claims that the possible
 
punishment should determine whether his offenses were serious. 
As the Pierce court indicated, such a mechanical test should not
 be used to classify an offense as serious. Id. Federal courts
 
have affirmed that the trial court may consider the maximum
 possible punishment when determining the seriousness of an
 offense. United States v. Howard, 218 F.3d 556, 561 (6th Cir.
 
2000); United States v. Koory, 20 F.3d 844, 847 (8th Cir. 1994);
 United States v. Melguizo, 824 F.2d 370, 371 (5th Cir. 1987);
 United States v. Simmons, 786 F.2d 479, 485 (2d Cir. 1986). 
However, other federal courts have also affirmed that offenses
 were serious based upon other factors. United States v. Brown,
 
770 F.2d 241, 244 (1st Cir. 1985) (distribution of substantial
 amount of a hard drug is a serious and grave offense against
 society as a whole); United States v. Kiszewski, 877 F.2d 210,
 214 (2d Cir. 1989) (charge of making false statements is serious
 because it strikes at the heart of administering criminal law);
 Pierce, 17 F.3d at 148 (income tax evasion is serious due to
 important duty to obey and need to enforce tax law compliance). 
Making the maximum possible punishment determinative of the
 seriousness of an offense unnecessarily curtails the trial
 court's discretion to evaluate the gravity of the crime. 
Consideration of the maximum possible punishment is merely one
 measure of the gravity of the offense. Howard, 218 F.3d at 561
 
(maximum sentence of life imprisonment for aggravated sexual
 assault underscores the gravity which it was viewed by Congress). 
Thus, the maximum possible punishment may be used in the
 Estencion factor analysis but is not determinative.
 
In addition, when determining whether offenses are
 
serious, the trial court may consider the combination of the
 charges in its Estencion analysis. United States v. Dessesaure,
 
556 F.3d 83, 85-86 (1st Cir. 2009) (offenses charged were serious
 when combination of drug trafficking and guns has imposed a grim
 toll on society); Koory, 20 F.3d at 846-47 (offenses of using and
 carrying firearm during drug trafficking crime and possession of
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
cocaine with intent to distribute were serious offenses when gun
 
used in a drug trafficking offense).
 
In this case, the District Court concluded that
 
although the charges were petty misdemeanors, all of the offenses
 were serious, the offenses were inextricably tied to the OVUII
 charge, and that OVUII was a serious offense because it could
 result in significant harm to life and property by way of
 vehicular accidents due to intoxicated driving. The District
 Court could have properly concluded that the gravity of the
 charges taken as a whole were more serious than any of the
 charges considered separately. Therefore, this court cannot
 conclude that the District Court abused its discretion in finding
 that the offenses were serious. Consequently, the District Court
 did not err by dismissing the charges against Fukuoka without
 prejudice.
 
Fukuoka also argues that the District Court may have
 
been "improperly influenced with numerous, unverified hearsay
 about the underlying factual allegations of the case instead of
 focusing on the charges and the legislature's determination of
 their seriousness by their respective maximum penalties." 
However, the authority upon which Fukuoka relies does not
 prohibit consideration of the facts of the case itself in
 determining the seriousness of the offenses. Moreover, as
 neither the transcript Fukuoka presents nor the District Court's
 findings of fact and conclusions of law indicate reliance on the
 "underlying factual allegations", Fukuoka's argument is
 unsupported by this record.
 
Fukuoka points to the prosecution's refiling of the
 
charges before his reconsideration motion was decided. However,
 he has not made a cogent argument regarding how this fact relates
 to the Estencion factors, and we reject it. 
Similarly, Fukuoka has failed to show how his remaining
 
arguments, which appear to be challenges to the prosecution's
 
6

arguments below, support his challenge to the District Court's
 
conclusions of law and we therefore find them without merit. 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of Entry of
 
Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, entered on April 14, 2015 in the District Court of the Second Circuit, Moloka
'i 
Division, is affirmed.
