ORDER DISMISSING APPELLATE COURT CASE NUMBER
 
CAAP-15-0000462 FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)

Board of Education's (the State Appellants) appeal and
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Plaintiff/Appellee/Cross-Appellant Dianne Kawashima's (Cross-
Appellant Kawashima) cross-appeal from the Honorable Edwin C. Nacino's May 18, 2015 judgment, because the May 18, 2015 judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable final judgment under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2015), Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP) and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals from final judgments, 
orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641­1(c). HRCP Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document. "An appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 119, 869 
P.2d at 1338. "Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai
'i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 
1186 (2008); Bailey v. DuVauchelle, 135 Hawai 'i 482, 489, 353 
P.3d 1024, 1031 (2015). Furthermore, 
if a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a case
involving multiple claims or multiple parties, the judgment
(a) must specifically identify the party or parties for and
against whom the judgment is entered, and (b) must (i)
identify the claims for which it is entered, and
(ii) dismiss any claims not specifically identified[.]
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (emphases added). 
For example: "Pursuant to the jury verdict entered on
(date), judgment in the amount of $___ is hereby entered in
favor of Plaintiff X and against Defendant Y upon counts I
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
through IV of the complaint." . . . . If the circuit court
 
intends that claims other than those listed in the judgment
language should be dismissed, it must say so: for example,
"Defendant Y's counterclaim is dismissed," or "Judgment upon
Defendant Y's counterclaim is entered in favor of
 Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all other claims,
counterclaims, and cross-claims are dismissed."
 
Id. at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4 (emphasis added). 
When interpreting the requirements for an appealable final
 judgment under HRS § 641-1(a) and HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court
 of Hawai
'i has explained that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality, . . . and we should not make such searches
necessary by allowing the parties the option of waiving the
requirements of HRCP [Rule] 58.
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (citation omitted; 
original emphasis). 
Although the instant case involves two separate and 
distinct counts that Cross-Appellant Kawashima asserted in her 
December 15, 2011 second amended complaint, the May 18, 2015 judgment purports to enter judgment in favor of Cross-Appellant Kawashima and against the State Appellants in the amount of $24,026,329.52, without specifically identifying the count on which the circuit court intends to enter judgment. Furthermore, the May 18, 2015 judgment does not contain language that either enters judgment on or dismisses the remaining count. Although the May 18, 2015 judgment closes with a statement that "[t]here are no remaining claims, parties or issues[,]" the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has explained that 
[a] statement that declares "there are no other outstanding
claims" is not a judgment. If the circuit court intends
 
that claims other than those listed in the judgment language
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
should be dismissed, it must say so: for example,
"Defendant Y's counterclaim is dismissed," or "Judgment upon
Defendant Y's counterclaim is entered in favor of
 Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all other claims,
counterclaims, and cross-claims are dismissed."
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4 
(emphases added). Without specifically identifying the claim on 
which the circuit court intends to enter judgment, and without language that expressly dismisses the remaining claim, the May 18, 2015 judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable final judgment under HRS § 641-1(a), HRCP Rule 54(b), HRCP Rule 58, and the holding in Jenkins. Absent an appealable final judgment, we lack appellate jurisdiction. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
 
case number CAAP-15-0000462 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
