 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to Rule 40 of the Hawai 'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP), 
and (3) the record, it appears that, although we did not overlook 
or misapprehend any points of law or fact when we entered the February 3, 2016 dismissal order, the circuit court subsequently entered a February 11, 2016 amended judgment that satisfies the requirements for an appealable final judgment under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) §641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2015), Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) and the holding in 
Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright
, 76 Hawai 'i 115, 119, 
869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the State 
Appellants' and Cross-Appellant Kawashima's February 12, 2016 joint motion for reconsideration is granted, appellate court case number CAAP-15-0000462 is reinstated, and the appellate court clerk shall make the case ready for review by a merit panel of the Hawai
'i Intermediate Court of Appeals. 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that, pursuant to HRAP 
Rule 10(e)(2)(C), the circuit court clerk shall, within ten days after entry of this order, supplement the record on appeal with the February 11, 2016 amended judgment in Civil No. 06-1-0244-02 (ECN).
