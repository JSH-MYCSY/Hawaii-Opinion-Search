ORDER DISMISSING APPELLATE COURT CASE NUMBER
 
CAAP-15-0000463 FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
appellate jurisdiction over Defendant-Appellant State of 
Hawai'i's (Appellant State) appeal from the Honorable Karl K. 
Sakamoto's May 19, 2015 judgment, because the May 18, 2015 judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable final judgment under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2015), Rules 54 and 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 
(1994). 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals from final judgments, 
orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641­1(c). HRCP Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." "An appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 
119, 869 P.2d at 1338. "Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai
'i 245, 254, 195 
P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008); Bailey v. DuVauchelle, 135 Hawai 'i 482, 
489, 353 P.3d 1024, 1031 (2015). When interpreting the requirements for an appealable final judgment under HRS § 641­1(a) and HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has explained 
that 
-2­ NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality, . . . and we should not make such searches
necessary by allowing the parties the option of waiving the
requirements of HRCP [Rule] 58.
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (citation omitted; 
original emphasis). Consequently, "an appeal from any judgment 
will be dismissed as premature if the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. For example, "a 
judgment or order in a consolidated case, disposing of fewer than all claims among all parties, is not appealable in the absence of [HRCP] Rule 54(b) certification." Leslie v. Estate of Tavares, 
109 Hawai
'i 8, 13, 122 P.3d 803, 808 (2005). Furthermore, 
whenever HRCP Rule 54(b)-certification is necessary, "a party cannot appeal from a circuit court order even though the order may contain [HRCP Rule] 54(b) certification language; the order must be reduced to a judgment and the [HRCP Rule] 54(b) certification language must be contained therein." Oppenheimer 
v. AIG Hawaii Ins. Co., 77 Hawai
'i 88, 93, 881 P.2d 1234, 1239 
(1994). 
The instant case involves multiple claims, namely
 
Count 1 and Count 2 of the January 6, 2005 third amended
 complaint in Civil No. 03-1-000305 (KKS), and Count 1, Count 2
 and Count 3 in the January 14, 2005 first amended complaint in
 Civil No. 05-1-0031 (KKS). On July 13, 2005, the circuit court
 entered an order consolidating Civil No. 03-1-000305 with Civil
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
-4-No. 05-1-0031-01, and, thus, the final judgment in this
consolidated case must either resolve all claims in both cases or
contain the finding necessary for certification of a judgment as
to one or more but fewer than all claims or parties pursuant to
HRCP Rule 54(b).  The May 19, 2015 judgment appears to enter
judgment in favor of and against certain parties as to Count 1
and Count 2 of the January 6, 2005 third amended complaint in
Civil No. 03-1-000305 (KKS), but the May 19, 2015 judgment
neither enters judgment on nor dismisses the three enumerated
counts in the January 14, 2005 first amended complaint in Civil
No. 05-1-0031.  Furthermore, the May 19, 2015 judgment does not
expressly certify this judgment as an appealable judgment with a
finding of no just reason for delay in the entry of judgment as
to one or more but fewer than all claims or parties pursuant to
HRCP Rule 54(b).  Although the May 19, 2015 concludes with a
statement that "[t]here are no remaining claims, parties or
issues," the Supreme Court of Hawai #i explained long ago that
[a] statement that declares "there are no other outstanding
claims" is not a judgment.  If the circuit court intends
that claims other than those listed in the judgment language
should be dismissed, it must say so: for example,
"Defendant Y's counterclaim is dismissed," or "Judgment upon
Defendant Y's counterclaim is entered in favor of
Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all other claims,
counterclaims, and cross-claims are dismissed."
Jenkins, 76 Hawai# i at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4
(emphases added).  Because the May 19, 2015 judgment neither
resolves all claims nor contains the necessary finding for
certification of a judgment on fewer than all claims under HRCP
Rule 54(b), the May 19, 2015 judgment does not satisfy the
requirements for an appealable final judgment under HRS § 641-
1(a), HRCP Rule 54(b), HRCP Rule 58 and the holdings in Jenkins. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Absent an appealable final judgment, we lack appellate
 
jurisdiction. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
 
case number CAAP-15-0000463 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
