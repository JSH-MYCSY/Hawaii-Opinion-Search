STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
JACQUELINE M. EARL, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION

 
(CASE NO. 1DCW-15-0001089)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, and Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
Defendant-Appellant Jacqueline M. Earl appeals from the
 
Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order, filed on May 19, 2015
 
in the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division
 
("District Court").1 Earl was convicted of Criminal Property
 
Damage in the Fourth Degree, in violation of Hawaii Revised
 Statutes ("HRS") § 708-823(1) (2014).
2 On appeal, Earl contends
 
that there was insufficient evidence to convict her and that the
 
1 The Honorable Shirley M. Kawamura presided.

 HRS § 708-823(1) states:
 
Criminal property damage in the fourth degree. (1) A
person commits the offense of criminal property damage in
the fourth degree if by means other than fire, the person
intentionally or knowingly damages the property of another
without the other's consent.

State failed to disprove her choice of evils defense under HRS
 
§ 703-302(1) (2014).3
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments they advance and the issues they raise, we resolve
 Earl's points of error as follows:
 
When the evidence adduced in the trial court is 
considered in the strongest light for the prosecution, State v. Matavale, 115 Hawai
'i 149, 157, 166 P.3d 322, 330 (2007), the 
State adduced substantial evidence to support Earl's conviction. 
"Substantial evidence" as to every material element of
the offense charged is credible evidence which is of
sufficient quality and probative value to enable a man
of reasonable caution to support a conclusion. And
 as trier of fact, the trial judge is free to make all
reasonable and rational inferences under the facts in
 evidence, including circumstantial evidence.
 
State v. Batson, 73 Hawai 'i 236, 248-49, 831 P.2d 924, 931 (1992) 
(citations omitted). 
On February 14, 2015, Honolulu Police Department
 
("HPD") Officer Christopher Nutter observed Earl and others
 
walking on Kapiolani Boulevard around 2:00 a.m. He observed Earl
 and at least four other people arguing, which escalated into
 yelling. After turning his vehicle around and pulling over,
 Officer Nutter observed Earl and another female fighting. 
Another officer sprayed Oleoresin Capsicum, commonly referred to
 as pepper spray. After other officers arrived, they pulled Earl
 
3 HRS § 703-302(1) states:
 
Choice of evils. (1) Conduct which the actor
 
believes to be necessary to avoid an imminent harm or evil
to the actor or to another is justifiable provided that:
 
(a)	 The harm or evil sought to be avoided by such
conduct is greater than that sought to be
prevented by the law defining the offense
charged;
 
(b)	 Neither the Code nor other law defining the
offense provides exceptions or defenses dealing
with the specific situation involved; and
 
(c)	 A legislative purpose to exclude the
justification claimed does not otherwise plainly
appear.

and the other female apart. Earl and the other female were
 
arrested and Earl was placed in a police car. Officer Jason Kubo
 testified that he also yelled at Earl and another woman to stop
 fighting but was ignored. Earl was able to deliver a couple more
 punches before he grabbed her arm and pulled her away. He could
 smell alcohol on both women. After grabbing Earl's arm, she
 continued to throw punches, so he deployed pepper spray. After
 spraying them in the facial area, he was able to pull Earl away
 and placed her in handcuffs to prevent further injury to both
 parties. Officer Kubo stated that Earl was screaming and seemed
 to be in distress from the pepper spray but did not recall Earl
 saying that she could not breathe. Officer Israel Prieto placed
 Earl into HPD vehicle 1210. Earl was screaming, "My eyes hurt."
 After Officer Prieto placed Earl in the backseat of the vehicle,
 Earl lay down and kicked out the window with both of her feet.
 Officer Prieto stated that Earl kicked the window at least twice. 
Earl was taken to Straub where she was cleaned up before being
 taken to the police station. Joseph Correa, III, an auto repair
 supervisor for the HPD Vehicle Maintenance Section, stated that
 it would take some force to cause the type of damage Earl caused
 to the window. Correa further stated that HPD Vehicle 1210
 belonged to the City and County of Honolulu, Honolulu Police
 Department, and that no one had permission to damage the vehicle. 
Earl testified that she was attempting to prevent an
 
argument between two other people when she was attacked. 
She was
 
pushed to the ground and did not know how another woman ended up
 on the ground. Earl stated that she has asthma and after she was
 sprayed, she was wheezing, had a hard time breathing, she
 complained about her eyes, and asked the officer if he could roll
 down the window. Earl stated that she was screaming at the top
 of her lungs over and over again, begging for an officer to roll
 down the window. Earl also stated that she could not see
 anything, her hair was in her face, and it felt like her whole
 head was on fire. Earl denied intentionally or knowingly kicking
 out the window and stated "I didn't even know I did that at all
 until they pulled - - I was in the car. The next thing I know

they're pulling me out and I didn't even know why." Earl stated
 
that she did not mean to do that and apologized all the way to
 the station.
 
The District Court found the HPD Officers' and Correa's 
testimonies to be credible. "It is well-settled that an appellate court will not pass upon issues dependent upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence; this is the province of the trier of fact." State v. Mattiello, 90 
Hawai
'i 255, 259, 978 P.2d 693, 697 (1999) (quoting State v. 
Buch, 83 Hawai 'i 308, 321, 926 P.2d 599, 612 (1996)) (brackets 
omitted). 
There was substantial evidence that HPD vehicle 1210 
was damaged when its window was kicked out by Earl, no consent was given by HPD to damage HPD vehicle 1210, and that Earl kicked out the window. "[G]iven the difficulty of proving the requisite state of mind by direct evidence in criminal cases, 'we have consistently held that . . . proof by circumstantial evidence and reasonable inferences arising from circumstances surrounding the [defendant's conduct] is sufficient. . . . Thus, the mind of an alleged offender may be read from his acts, conduct and inferences fairly drawn from all the circumstances.'" State v. 
Stocker, 90 Hawai
'i 85, 92, 976 P.2d 399, 406 (1999) (original 
brackets omitted) (quoting State v. Mitsuda, 86 Hawai 'i 37, 44, 
947 P.2d 349, 356 (1997)). Based on Earl's acts, conduct, and the inferences fairly drawn from all the circumstances, there was substantial evidence that Earl intentionally or knowingly damaged the window of HPD vehicle 1210 when she lay down in the vehicle and kicked the window with enough force to push it out. 
The choice of evils defense is a type of justification 
defense. Haw. Rev. Stat. § 703-302(1) and cmt. "The prosecution disproves a justification defense beyond a reasonable doubt when the trial court believes the prosecution's case and disbelieves the defendant's case." State v. Jhun, 83 Hawai
'i 472, 483, 927 
P.2d 1355, 1366 (1996).
