C&C due process by sanctioning C&C without affording it a hearing
 
and (2) abused its discretion when it sanctioned C&C by ordering
 it to pay reasonable attorney's fees and expenses for Plaintiff-
Appellee Mitchell T. Tojio (Tojio).
I. BACKGROUND
3
 
On July 18, 2013, Tojio filed a lawsuit against
 
4
Defendant-Appellee James M. Panozzo (Panozzo)  for damages
arising out of a motor vehicle accident. Panozzo allegedly rear-
ended Tojio, an on-duty police officer for the Honolulu Police
 Department on July 22, 2010. Tojio sought damages including, but
 not limited to, the lost wages and incurred medical expenses that
 C&C paid through worker's compensation. C&C, who was not a party
 in the lawsuit, asserted a statutory lien in the amount of
 $
97,551.55 for the workers compensation benefits provided to
 
Tojio following the accident.
 
The circuit court conducted four settlement conferences
 
over seven months. During the third settlement conference on
 February 4, 2015, Panozzo made a final settlement offer of
 $45,000, which Tojio indicated he wanted to accept. The circuit

(b) Opening brief. Within 40 days after the filing of
the record on appeal, the appellant shall file an opening
brief, containing the following sections in the order here
indicated:
 
. . . .
 
(4) A concise statement of the points of error set
forth in separately numbered paragraphs. Each point shall
state: (i) the alleged error committed by the court or
agency; (ii) where in the record the alleged error occurred;
and (iii) where in the record the alleged error was objected
to or the manner in which the alleged error was brought to
the attention of the court or agency.
 
(Emphasis added.) Counsel for C&C is warned that future noncompliance with
HRAP Rule 28(b) may result in sanctions.
 
3 This background is taken primarily from the circuit court's
FOFs/COLs/Order, which C&C does not challenge on appeal. Findings of fact notchallenged on appeal are binding on this court. Okada Trucking Co., Ltd. v.
Bd. of Water Supply, 97 Hawai' i 450, 458, 40 P.3d 73, 81 (2002). 
4 Panozzo has not filed a brief in this appeal.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
court tried to find a compromise between Tojio and C&C, but the
 
parties could not settle on a compromised lien amount. C&C
 represented to the circuit court and to the other parties that it
 would be filing a motion to intervene to pursue Tojio's claims at
 trial because C&C viewed Panozzo's settlement offer as
 inadequate. The circuit court set February 13, 2015 as the
 deadline for C&C to file its motion to intervene and for Tojio's
 counsel to withdraw.
 
On February 11, 2015, C&C confirmed in writing its
 
intention to file a motion to intervene in a letter sent to
 Tojio, stating that it did not believe Tojio was representing the
 best interest of C&C on its workers' compensation lien.
 
On February 13, 2015, Tojio's counsel filed a timely
 
motion to withdraw as counsel.
 
C&C, however, did not file a motion to intervene by the
 
circuit court's February 13, 2015 deadline. Instead, C&C filed a
 notice of workers' compensation lien and wrote a letter to the
 circuit court indicating that it was not going to intervene in
 the case. Describing the impact of C&C's decision to renege on
 its stated position on intervening, the circuit court stated:
 
30. [C&C's] conduct was extremely disruptive to the
settlement process, orderly procedures for settlement
conferences, and orderly scheduling of motions and trials.
 
31. [C&C's] actions of not filing a motion to
intervene, when it had insisted that intervention was
necessary, impeded the settlement process, and wasted the
time of the court and other parties. Scheduling decisions,
discovery completion, and trial preparation decisions for
the 4/13/15 jury trial that had been made in reliance upon
[C&C] filing a motion to intervene, were impacted by [C&C's]
failure to file the motion.
[5]
 
(Footnote omitted.) On February 17, 2015, the circuit court 
issued an "Order to Show Cause" directed to counsel for C&C "to show why, in view of [C&C's] February 13, 2015 letter to the court, [C&C] should not be sanctioned for undue interference with orderly court procedures, in violation of [Rules of the Circuit Courts of the State of Hawai
'i (RCCH)] Rule 12.1." 
5 C&C does not challenge these findings by the circuit court in its
points of error.
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The circuit court ordered the parties to attend the
 
fourth and final settlement conference, which took place on
 
February 19, 2015. Tojio, Panozzo, and C&C came to a settlement
 agreement. Panozzo agreed to pay Tojio $45,000 in general
 damages, and C&C agreed to accept $7,250 from the total
 settlement to resolve and satisfy the workers' compensation lien.
 C&C requested that Tojio "substantiate" his estimated $12,500 in
 "costs," to which Tojio agreed.
 
Based upon the settlement agreed to by the parties, the
 
circuit court vacated the trial date, trial deadlines, and the
 order to show cause hearing. The circuit court also ordered the
 parties to submit a stipulation to dismiss the case within thirty
 days.
 
Tojio provided C&C an itemized report of Tojio's costs
 
with related receipts, totaling $12,370.05, which was close to
 Tojio's estimation of costs at $12,500. C&C then raised what the
 circuit court described as "unreasonable and improper objections"
 to Tojio's claimed costs. The circuit court elaborated on C&C's
 objections:
 
42. First, [C&C] argued that $390.15 of [Tojio's]
$12,370.05 total costs was not "taxable," as if the case
went to trial and there was a non-prevailing party who would
be taxed with costs post-trial. This case settled and did
 not go to trial. Whether or not any of [Tojio's] incurred
costs were "taxable" against a non-prevailing party post-
trial was completely irrelevant.
 
43. Second, [C&C] alleged that [Tojio's] counsel's
law firm only "substantiated" $10,364.79 out of the
$12,370.05 in total costs incurred, and the lack of receipts
for postage and copying invalidated $2,015.66 of [Tojio's]
costs. [Tojio's] counsel explained to [C&C] that the postage
and copying charges of $2,015.66 had no receipts because it
was done in-house. [Tojio's] counsel also provided [C&C]
with a cost spreadsheet. [C&C] did not respond to his
explanation or ask for anything more specific or anything
further. In this court's view, [Tojio's] counsel's
representation, as an officer of the court, to [C&C]
regarding the amount of such costs should have been
sufficient.
 
44. Third, [C&C] made a new and novel argument that
costs incurred before the lawsuit was filed were not "valid"
 and should be excluded from [Tojio's] total costs.
[6]
 
6 C&C does not challenge these findings by the circuit court in its
points of error.
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(Footnote omitted.)  C&C proposed that Tojio pay C&C $8,317.60
 
instead of the $7,250 the parties had previously agreed upon
 
because C&C viewed Tojio's costs as "unsubstantiated" and "non­taxable."
 
Tojio filed a Motion to Enforce Settlement on March 17,
 
2015, which included a request to sanction C&C and a declaration
 by Tojio's counsel regarding C&C's alleged misconduct. Ruling on
 Tojio's Motion to Enforce Settlement on May 21, 2015, the circuit
 court made its conclusions of law (COLs):
 
51. To the extent any of these [COLs] are Findings
of Fact, they are to be so construed.
 
52. [Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 603-21.9(6)
(1993)] confers upon circuit courts, the inherent power to
make and award such judgments, decrees, and orders, "and do
such other acts and take such other steps as may be
necessary to carry into full effect the powers which are or
shall be given to them by law or for the promotion of
justice in matters pending before them."
 
53. RCCH Rule 1 requires that, "these rules shall be
construed and administered to secure the just, speedy, and
inexpensive determination of every action."
 
54. RCCH Rule 12.1(a)6), pertaining to settlement
conferences, provides for the imposition of sanctions for
"undue interference with orderly procedures."
 
55. As a general proposition, "in the absence of bad
faith or fraud, when parties enter into an agreement
settling and adjusting a dispute, neither party is permitted
to repudiate it." Miller v. Manuel, 9 Haw. App. 56, 63
(1991) (quoting In re Estates of Thompson, 226 Kan. 437, 440
(1979)). There has been no bad faith or fraud alleged by
[C&C].
 
56. The award of post-trial taxable costs is a rule
that applies to the taxation and award of costs to aprevailing party after a trial. See [Hawai' i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP)] Rule 54(d)(1)("costs shall be allowed asof course to the prevailing party unless the court otherwisedirects"). The cases relied upon by [C&C] relate to thetaxation of costs after a trial or a dismissal of claims. See, e.g., Kikuchi v. Brown, 110 Hawai' i 204, 210 (App.
2006) (finding that [the] burden was on the non-prevailingparty to show that the claimed costs were unreasonable). In this case, neither [Tojio] nor [C&C] went to trial. 
57. It is undisputed that [C&C's] attorneys never
distinguished between post-trial taxable and non-taxable
costs during the court's settlement conferences. Nor did
 they raise such a distinction at any time before or during,
the formal placement of settlement terms on the record on
2/19/15. During the recital of the settlement terms,
[C&C's] attorney simply stated, "we would ask for [Tojio] to
substantiate the $12,500.00 in costs."
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
58. If [C&C] wanted to differentiate [Tojio's] costs
between post-trial taxable and non-taxable costs, it was
incumbent on [C&C] to have expressly raised that issue with[Tojio] and the court during the formal settlementconferences. It never did, and cannot belated[ly] do sopost-settlement. See Standard Mgmt., Inc. v. Kekona, 99 
Hawai'i 125, 134 (App. 2001) ("It follows that the purely
subjective, or secret, intent of a party in assenting isirrelevant in an inquiry into the contractual intent of theparties."). 
59. The record is also clear that [C&C's] attorney
did not mention any exclusion, or distinction, regarding
pre-suit costs. See Earl M. Jorgensen Co. v. Mark Const.,
Inc., 56 Haw. 466, 470-71 (1975) ("The existence of mutual
assent or intent to accept is determined by an objective
standard. A party's words or acts are judged under a
standard of reasonableness in determining whether he has
manifested an objective intention to agree. All reasonable
 meanings will be imputed as representative of a party's
corresponding objective intention. Unexpressed intentions
are nugatory when the problem is to ascertain the legal
relations, if any, between two parties."). [C&C] is
foreclosed from making such a belated distinction post-
settlement.
 
60. The in-house copying costs ($1,967.30) and
postage costs ($48.36) were necessary costs incurred in the
ordinary course of preparing and prosecuting [Tojio's]
claims against [Panozzo] up to the time of settlement.
There are no receipts for these charges because the copying
and postage were done in-house. [Tojio's counsel] confirmed
and verified the total charges incurred with a spreadsheet.
As an officer of the court, [Tojio's] counsel verified the
costs to [C&C] and nothing more was required.
 
61.
 [C&C] consented to this settlement in the amount
of $45,000.00, general damages only, net of the covered loss
deductible, in consideration for a payback on its workers'
compensation lien in the amount of $7,250.00. [Tojio]
estimated his costs at the time of settlement to be
 $12,500.00.
 
62. [Tojio's] counsel agreed, on the record, that
even if [Tojio's] costs ended being higher than $12,500.00,
[C&C] would still receive the $7,500.00 from the settlement.
 
63. [C&C] asserts in its Opposition that the
"parties agreed that [Tojio] would be reimbursed up to
$12,500 for costs incurred as a result of this case subject
to substantiation of costs." (Emphasis added). Thus, [C&C]
acknowledges that it agreed to accept $7,250.00 to
extinguish the lien based on costs incurred by [Tojio] up to
$12,500.00.
 
64. The first $12,370.05 costs figure submitted by
[Tojio] to [C&C], was timely submitted and complied with the
settlement term that [Tojio] substantiate up to the
$12,500.00 which he estimated were his costs, at the time
settlement was reached.
 
65. [Tojio] executed the settlement agreement on
3/11/15, and promptly delivered the $7,250.00 check to
[C&C]. There was a meeting of the minds and both [Tojio]
and [Panozzo] fulfilled their obligations under the
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
settlement agreement. [C&C] did not fulfill its obligations
under the settlement agreement.[7]
 
(Brackets and footnote omitted.)
 
The circuit court sanctioned C&C for its conduct,
 
stating:
 
66. [C&C's] post-settlement objections to the manner
in which [Tojio] substantiated his copying and postage

costs, and quibbling over non-existing "taxable" costs and
pre-suit costs distinctions, were obstructionist,
unreasonable, and constitute[d] bad faith. [C&C's] conduct
in precipitating this settlement dispute, violated RCCH Rule
12.1.
 
67. [C&C's] conduct, in this post-settlement
dispute, is even more egregious, following [C&C's] prior

interference with court procedures caused by [C&C's]
extremely tardy and never-filed motion to intervene.
 
68. [C&C's] conduct has wasted 6.5 hours of in-court
time spent on the four settlement conferences, additional 

court time expended on out-of-court negotiations, and court
resources used to schedule, vacate, and reset the various
court dates and deadlines. [C&C's] conduct disrespected the
settlement process and unduly interfered with this court's
procedures.
 
69. Sanctions must be meaningful and must be an
effective deterrent to future misconduct and disregard of

court rules, including the spirit, intent, and purpose of
such rules, which are designed to promote the "just, speedy,
and inexpensive" resolution of court matters. See RCCH
 
Rules 1, 12.1(a)(6); HRS § 603-21.9.
 
70. Sanctions in the context of settlement, must be
imposed in a manner to promote respect for the time and

resources spent by the court and by the other parties on the
settlement process. In this case, the following sanctions
against [C&C], based on its conduct described supra, are
warranted and justified.
 
The circuit court ordered C&C to pay for all time spent by
 
Tojio's counsel, including reasonable attorney's fees and
 expenses, on the settlement dispute. The circuit court also
 ordered C&C to pay $1,000 to the circuit court "for wasted court
 time."
8
 
C&C filed its notice of appeal on June 17, 2015.
 
7 The findings of fact contained in the circuit court's FOFs/COLs/Order
were not challenged or disputed by C&C in its points of error in this appeal. 
8 Beyond its general due process argument, C&C does not challenge that
part of the sanction ordering payment of $1,000 to the court. Rather, C&C
challenges the part of the sanction ordering it to pay Tojio's attorney's fees
and costs related to the settlement dispute.
 
7

II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
"Regardless of whether sanctions are imposed pursuant 
to statute, circuit court rule, or the trial court's inherent 
powers, such awards are reviewed for an abuse of discretion." Kaina v. Gellman, 119 Hawai
'i 324, 329, 197 P.3d 776, 781 (App. 
2008) (citing Gap v. Puna Geothermal Venture, 106 Hawai 'i 325, 
331, 104 P.3d 912, 918 (2004)).
III. DISCUSSION
 
A. C&C's Entitlement to a Hearing
 
C&C argues that "[t]he circuit court should have 
allowed [C&C] a hearing on its Order to Show Cause if it was all along planning to impose sanctions because [Tojio's counsel] had agreed on the record to substantiate his costs and [C&C] had an unquestionable duty to ensure Tojio met this condition of the settlement." In support of its argument, C&C states, "the Hawai
'i Court Rules generally require hearings before 
sanctions are imposed. For instance, HRCP Rule 11(c) permits sanctions only after notice and a reasonable opportunity to respond . . . ." C&C contends, "[b]y analogy, [C&C] maintains that it should have had notice and an opportunity to be heard before sanctions were imposed." 
The circuit court initially scheduled a hearing for
 
March 6, 2015 on its Order to Show Cause "to show why, in view of
 [C&C's] February 13, 2015 letter to the Court, [C&C] should not
 be sanctioned for undue interference with orderly court
 procedures, in violation of RCCH Rule 12.1." The circuit court
 vacated the Order to Show Cause and the hearing when the parties
 reached a settlement at the February 19, 2015 settlement
 conference. When C&C reneged on the agreement, Tojio filed a
 Motion to Enforce the Settlement, which included a request for
 sanctions and a declaration by Tojio's counsel asserting C&C's
 alleged misconduct, for which the circuit court held a hearing on
 April 17, 2015. C&C was given the opportunity at the hearing to
 oppose the Motion to Enforce the Settlement Agreement and the
 imposition of sanctions for its conduct. Therefore, C&C's
 argument that it did not have an opportunity to be heard before
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
sanctions were imposed is without merit.
B. The Circuit Court's Sanctions
 
C&C next argues that the circuit court abused its
 
discretion in issuing sanctions because "[a]t no time did [C&C's]
 
counsel commit any bad faith or pursue unethical arguments
 because it only sought to receive proper verification of [Tojio's
 counsel's] costs." C&C also argues that RCCH Rule 12.1(a)(6) is
 an improper basis for imposing sanctions.
 
As a basis for its order of sanctions, the circuit
 
court cited HRS § 603-21.9(6), which authorizes the circuit
 courts "[t]o make and award such judgments, decrees, orders, and
 mandates . . . and take such other steps as may be necessary to
 carry into full effect the powers which are or shall be given to
 them by law or for the promotion of justice in matters pending
 before them." HRS § 603-21.9(6) is a "legislative restatement of
 the inherent powers doctrine[.]" Kukui Nuts of Hawaii, Inc. v.
 
R. Baird & Co., Inc., 6 Haw. App. 431, 437, 726 P.2d 268, 272 (1986). "The courts . . . have inherent power to curb abuses and promote a fair process, including the power to impose sanctions in the form of attorneys' fees for abusive litigation practices." Enos v. Pac. Transfer & Warehouse, Inc., 79 Hawai
'i 452, 458, 903 
P.2d 1273, 1279 (1995) (citations, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted); Kukui Nuts, 6 Haw. App. at 437, 726 P.2d at 272). The circuit court's inherent power to issue sanctions is limited, however, to conduct that "constitute[s] or [is] tantamount to bad faith." Kukui Nuts, 6 Haw. App. at 436, 726 
P.2d at 272. 
[I]n order to facilitate a meaningful and more efficient
appellate review, an order imposing sanctions should set
forth findings that describe, with reasonable specificity,
the perceived misconduct (such as harassment or bad faith
conduct), as well as the appropriate sanctioning authority
(e.g., HRCP Rule 11 or the court's inherent power).
 
Enos, 79 Hawai 'i at 459, 903 P.2d at 1280. 
In this case, the circuit court provided a thorough
 
explanation of the basis for its sanction award in COLs 66
 
through 70. Specifically, the circuit court concluded that C&C's
 objections to Tojio's stated costs "were obstructionist,
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
unreasonable, and constitute[d] bad faith." Additionally, after
 
repeated assurances that C&C would take over litigation for
 Tojio's counsel, and then its failure to file a motion to
 intervene, in conjunction with C&C's agreement to a settlement
 amount, followed by improper objections to the settlement
 
9
amount,  the circuit court was justified in concluding that C&C
acted in bad faith. 
The circuit court did not abuse its
 
discretion in sanctioning C&C.
