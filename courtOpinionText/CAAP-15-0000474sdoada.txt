IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
IN THE INTEREST OF ES
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-S NO. 13-00005)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
Mother-Appellant ("Mother") appeals from the June 3,
 
2015 "Order Terminating Parental Rights" and "Letters of
 
Permanent Custody," entered in the Family Court of the First
 Circuit ("Family Court").
1 The Family Court terminated Mother's
 
parental rights to her child, ES, and awarded permanent custody
 of him to the Department of Human Services ("DHS"). 
On appeal, Mother argues that the Family Court erred in
 
awarding permanent custody of ES to DHS after wrongly concluding
 that she was unwilling and unable to provide a safe home for ES
 within a reasonable period of time. Mother contests Findings of
 Fact ("FOFs") 72, 75, 76, 81, 83, 85, 87, 88, 91, 111-113, 117,
 123, 124, 126, 128, and 130, and Conclusions of Law ("COLs") 9-11
 in the court's June 16, 2015 "Findings of Fact and Conclusions of
 Law" ("FOF/COL"). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to

 The Honorable Bode A. Uale presided.
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
the arguments they advance and the issues they raise, we resolve
 
Mother's points of error as follows, and affirm:
 
(1) The Family Court's finding that Mother was not able 
and willing to provide ES with a safe family home, even with the assistance of a service plan, and would not become able or was unwilling to do so within a reasonable period of time was based on sufficient evidence. FOFs 112 and 113 and COLs 9 and 10 (which are actually findings of fact) are not clearly erroneous. See Haw. Rev. Stat. ยง 587A-7 (Supp. 2014); In re Doe, 95 Hawai
'i 
183, 190, 20 P.3d 616, 623 (2001); In Interest of Doe, 84 Hawai 'i 
41, 46, 928 P.2d 883, 888 (1996). 
(a) There is substantial evidence in the record on
 
appeal that Mother failed to understand or acknowledge the
 importance of DHS services in preventing harm to ES. In addition
 to Mother testifying that she and ES were safe in his father's
 ("Father") company, and stating that her previous accusations
 that Father abused her had been lies, DHS Supervisor Sharon Adric
 ("Adric") testified that Mother did not believe she needed
 services or that domestic violence was an issue and that Mother's
 failure to acknowledge the harm to ES indicated that she was not
 ready to make changes needed to provide him with a safe home. 
Therefore, FOFs 72 and 91 are not clearly erroneous.
 
(b) There is substantial evidence in the record on
 
appeal that Mother failed to participate in DHS-recommended
 services. Both Adric and Social Worker Crystal Cathcart
 testified that Mother did not complete or follow through with any
 of her services. In addition, at the trial, DHS Case Worker
 Barry Kwock ("Kwock") testified that Mother failed to participate
 in recommended anger management services, could not be referred
 for a psychological evaluation at the Kapiolani Child Protection
 Center because she failed to show up twice and had not
 demonstrated sobriety, did not follow through with parenting
 education and home-based parenting, and frequently missed or
 showed up late to visits with ES. Therefore, FOFs 75, 76, 81,
 83, 85, and 87 are not clearly erroneous.
 
(c) FOF 88 is not clearly erroneous because Kwock
 
testified that Mother was unable to engage in individual therapy

for substance abuse since she lacked medical insurance. 
(d) Mother contests FOF 128. However, it was within 
the Family Court's discretion to find that Mother was not 
credible, and such a finding is within the province of the trier of fact. See In re Doe, 95 Hawai
'i at 190, 20 P.3d at 623. 
(2) To the extent DHS did not maintain regular and
 
timely contact with Mother, the testimony showed that it was
 largely because Mother moved often and changed her phone number,
 was incarcerated or homeless at times throughout the case, and
 was nearly always accompanied by Father, whose violent tendencies
 made case workers fearful. FOFs 111, 123, and 124 are not
 clearly erroneous. 
(3) Mother argues that DHS failed to "assess fully all
 
relevant prior and current information concerning each of the
 safe family home guidelines," such as information from her
 therapist and the [Kaiser] aftercare program, in violation of
 Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 587-40(b)(1).
2 At the termination of
 
parental rights trial, Kwock testified that he maybe "should have
 followed up" more on Mother's claim that she was participating in
 Kaiser's aftercare program. Nevertheless, Mother fails to show
 that the alleged error prejudiced her where Mother testified that
 her claimed participation in the Kaiser program only lasted one
 to two months before her medical insurance "got cut off," various
 witnesses testified that Mother was non-compliant with substance
 abuse treatment and monitoring, including random urinalyses, and
 Mother testified she believed she did not need substance abuse
 treatment. Therefore, FOFs 126 and 130 are not clearly
 erroneous. 
(4) FOF 117 is not clearly erroneous because it 
reflects the testimony given at trial as well as the family court's credibility determination, which this court declines to overturn. See In re Doe, 95 Hawai
'i at 190, 20 P.3d at 623. 
(5) COL 11 is not wrong because it accurately reflects
 
the FOF/COL.
