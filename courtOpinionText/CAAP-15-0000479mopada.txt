subject matter jurisdiction and contends that he was deprived of
 due process because he was not allowed to appear telephonically,
 which we construe as a challenge to the district court's grant of
 default judgment against Watkins.
I. BACKGROUND
 
On February 10, 2015, Watkins executed a rental
 
agreement with a brokerage firm, Plaintiff-Appellee Gustafson
 Real Estate LLC (GRE), for a residential property with rent of
 
$1,795 per month.
 
On May 12, 2015, GRE filed a complaint in district
 
court for summary possession and to collect Watkins' unpaid rent
 
and late fees.
 
GRE contends that Watkins informed them that he would
 
not be appearing at the May 27, 2015 hearing and would not be
 contesting the issue of possession. Because of Watkins' failure
 to appear, the district court entered its Judgment for Possession
 in favor of GRE. The district court entered its Writ of
 Possession on May 29, 2015.
 
Watkins filed his notice of appeal on June 23, 2015, 
and purported to appeal from "the Ruling entered on May 26, 2015." The only entry on May 26, 2015 was a stricken "Notice of Removal to Federal Court." Watkins also stated that he was appealing from the "Ruling entered on June 10, 2015," the day on which the district court minutes indicate the district court stated its intention to enter a default against Watkins as to GRE's claims for damages. We construe Watkins' appeal to be from the May 29, 2015 Judgment for Possession, which was the only appealable judgment at the time Watkins filed his notice of appeal. See Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai
'i 18, 20, 889 P.3d 702, 
704 (1995) (concluding that a judgment for possession was a 
2(...continued)
agency; (ii) where in the record the alleged error occurred;
 
and (iii) where in the record the alleged error was objected
 
to or the manner in which the alleged error was brought to
 
the attention of the court or agency. . . .
 
 
. . . .
 
Points not presented in accordance with this section
will be disregarded, except that the appellate court, at its
option, may notice a plain error not presented.

judgment immediately appealable under the Forgay doctrine (citing
 Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848)).
 
The district court entered a default judgment against
 
Watkins on July 21, 2015 regarding GRE's claim for damages. We
 lack appellate jurisdiction with regard to this judgment.

II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
A. Subject Matter Jurisdiction
 
"The existence of subject matter jurisdiction is a 
question of law that is reviewable de novo under the right/wrong standard." U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n v. Castro, 131 Hawai
'i 28, 34, 
313 P.3d 717, 723 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Aames Funding Corp. v. Mores, 107 Hawai
'i 95, 98, 110 
P.3d 1042, 1045 (2005)).
B. Default Judgment
 
"Application of [Hawai 'i Rules of Civil Procedure] Rule 
55, which governs entry of default judgment, is reviewed for 
abuse of discretion." Gonsalves v. Nissan Motor Corp. in Hawaii, 
Ltd., 100 Hawai 'i 149, 158, 58 P.3d 1196, 1205 (2002). The same 
standard applies to the application of District Court Rules of Civil Procedure (DCRCP) Rule 55, which governs entry of default 
judgment in district court proceedings. See id. at 159, 58 P.3d 
at 1206. 
III. DISCUSSION
 
A. Subject Matter Jurisdiction 
Watkins asserts a broad challenge to the district 
court's subject matter jurisdiction. "Subject matter 
jurisdiction is concerned with whether the court has the power to hear a case." Int'l Bhd. of Painters & Allied Trades, Drywall 
Tapers, Finishers & Allied Workers Local Union 1944, AFL-CIO v. Befitel, 104 Hawai
'i 275, 281, 88 P.3d 647, 653 (2004) (quoting 
Pele Def. Fund v. Puna Geothermal Venture, 77 Hawai 'i 64, 67, 881 
P.2d 1210, 1213 (1994)). 
The district courts are granted jurisdiction in civil
 
actions by statute. Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 604-5(a)
 
(2015 Supp.) provides:
 
3 As best we can discern, the Honorable Gerald H. Kibe signed the order
entering default judgment.

ยง604-5 Civil jurisdiction. (a) Except as otherwise
provided, the district courts shall have jurisdiction in all
civil actions where the debt, amount, damages, or value of
the property claimed does not exceed $40,000, except in
civil actions involving summary possession or ejectment, in
which case the district court shall have jurisdiction over
any counterclaim otherwise properly brought by any defendant
in the action if the counterclaim arises out of and refers
 to the land or premises the possession of which is being
sought, regardless of the value of the debt, amount,
damages, or property claim contained in the counterclaim.
Attorney's commissions or fees, including those stipulated
in any note or contract sued on, interest, and costs, shall
not be included in computing the jurisdictional amount.
Subject to subsections (b) and (c), jurisdiction under this
subsection shall be exclusive when the amount in
 controversy, so computed, does not exceed $10,000. The
 district courts shall also have original jurisdiction of
suits for specific performance when the fair market value of
such specific performance does not exceed $20,000 and
original jurisdiction to issue injunctive relief in
residential landlord-tenant cases under chapter 521.
 
Here, GRE sought in its complaint for summary possession damages
 
 
against Watkins in the amount of $1,974.50 for his unpaid rent
 
 
and late fee. Under HRS ยง 605-5(a), the district court had
 
 
exclusive subject matter jurisdiction over GRE's action for
 
 
summary possession. Watkins' argument otherwise is without
 
 
merit.
 
 
B. Watkins' Failure to Appear in Court

 
We note that Watkins filed his notice of appeal on June
 
 
23, 2015 from the Judgment for Possession entered on May 29,
 
 
2015, before the district court entered its Default Judgment as
 
 
to damagaes on July 21, 2015. However, because the district
 
 
court entered the Judgment for Possession based on Watkins'
 
 
failure to appear and defend the lawsuit, we treat the entry of
 
 
the Judgment of Possession as a default judgment. 
 
DCRCP Rule 55 allows a district court to enter a
 
 
default judgment where a party "has failed to plead or otherwise
 
 
defend as provided by these rules[.]" DCRCP Rule 55(a). The
 
 
court may also set aside an entry of default judgment "[f]or good
 
 
cause shown" and "in accordance with Rule 60(b).[4]" DCRCP Rule
 
 
4 DCRCP Rule 60(b) provides:
 
Rule 60. RELIEF FROM JUDGMENT OR ORDER.

55(c). 
Default judgments are generally disfavored. Cty. of
 
 
Hawai'i v. Ala Loop Homeowners, 123 Hawai 'i 391, 423, 235 P.3d 
1103, 1135 (2010). "[T]he sanction of a default judgment is a
 
 
harsh one." Rearden Family Tr. v. Wisenbaker,  101 Hawai 'i 237, 
254, 65 P.3d 1029, 1046 (2003). "We affirm that defaults and
 
 
default judgments are not favored and that any doubt should be
 
 
resolved in favor of the party seeking relief, so that, in the
 
 
interests of justice, there can be a full trial on the merits." 
 
Id. (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Lambert v. Lua,
 
 
92 Hawai 'i 228, 235, 990 P.2d 126, 133 (App. 1999)). In BDM, 
Inc. v. Sageco, Inc., 57 Haw. 73, 549 P.2d 1147 (1976), the
 
 
Hawai'i Supreme Court held that a party seeking to set aside a 
default must demonstrate three factors:
 
 
In general, a motion to set aside a default entry or a
default judgment may and should be granted whenever the
court finds (1) that the nondefaulting party will not be
prejudiced by the reopening, (2) that the defaulting party
has a meritorious defense, and (3) that the default was not
the result of inexcusable neglect or a wilful act.
 
Id. at 76, 549 P.2d at 1150; see Ala Loop Homeowners, 123 Hawai 'i 
4(...continued)
 
discovered evidence; fraud, etc. On motion and upon such

terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or the
party's legal representative from a final judgment, order,
or proceeding for the following reasons: (1) mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly
discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have
been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule
 59(b); (3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic
or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an
adverse party; (4) the judgment is void; (5) the judgment
has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or a prior
judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or
otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the
judgment should have prospective application; or (6) any
other reason justifying relief from the operation of the
judgment. The motion shall be made within a reasonable time,
and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) not more than one year
after the judgment, order, or proceeding was entered or
taken. A motion under this subdivision (b) does not affect
the finality of a judgment or suspend its operation. This
rule does not limit the power of a court of competent
jurisdiction to entertain an independent action to relieve a
party from a judgment, order, or proceeding, or to set aside
a judgment for fraud upon the court. Writs of coram nobis,
coram vobis, audita querela, and bills of review and bills
in the nature of a bill of review, are abolished, and the
procedure for obtaining any relief from a judgment shall be
by motion as prescribed in these rules or by an independent
action.

Although it appears Watkins attempted to defend the 
lawsuit against him related to damages, it does not appear that 
he contested the Judgment for Possession, and in any event he did not file a motion for relief from the judgment under DCRCP Rule 60(b) with the district court as required by DCRCP Rule 55(c). He has otherwise failed to articulate a meritorious defense that would warrant setting aside the default judgment under DCRCP Rule 55(c). See BDM, 57 Haw. at 76, 549 P.2d at 1150. Watkins has 
failed to demonstrate that he is entitled to relief from the judgment. The district court did not abuse its discretion in entering a judgment for possession against Watkins. See 
Gonsalves, 100 Hawai
'i at 158, 58 P.3d at 1205. 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
Therefore, the "Judgment for Possession" entered on May
 
29, 2015 in the District Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.
