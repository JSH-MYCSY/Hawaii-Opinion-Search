IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
NICHOLAS A. PARTIN, Defendant-Appellant
 
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
 
(CASE NO. 3DTA-15-00283)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
Defendant-Appellant Nicholas A. Partin appeals from the
 
Judgment and Notice of Entry of Judgment, filed on May 27, 2015
 
in the District Court of the Third Circuit ("District Court").1
 
Partin was convicted in a bench trial of Count 1, Operating a
 Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant ("OVUII") in
 violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") section 291EÂ­
61(a)(1) (Supp. 2014); Count 2, Refusal to Submit to Breath,
 Blood, or Urine Test in violation of HRS section 291E-15 (Supp.
 2014); and Count 3, driving without a license in violation of HRS
 section 286-102(b) (Supp. 2014).

On appeal, Partin contends that the District Court 
erred (1) in admitting the results of a Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus ("HGN") test because (a) Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai
'i 
failed to lay an adequate foundation for its admission into evidence, (b) there was insufficient foundation that Hawai
'i

 The Honorable Margaret K. Masunaga presided.

 In this appeal, Partin only challenges his conviction on Count 1.

Police Officer Sheldon Nakamoto was qualified to conduct and
 
evaluate the HGN test, and (c) there was insufficient evidence to
 show that the HGN test was properly conducted; and (2) by
 admitting the HGN test result as substantive evidence of
 impairment. Partin also contends that the erroneous admission of
 the HGN test result was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt
 because the other evidence that he was operating his vehicle
 while impaired was not overwhelming. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Partin's points of error as follows and vacate his OVUII
 conviction.
 
(1) Partin contends that the District Court erred in 
admitting Officer Nakamoto's testimony regarding Partin's performance on the HGN test because the State failed to lay a sufficient foundation for such testimony. "Before HGN test results can be admitted into evidence in a particular case . . . it must be shown that (1) the officer administering the test was duly qualified to conduct the test and grade the test results, and (2) the test was performed properly in the instant case." State v. Ito, 90 Hawai
'i 225, 244, 978 P.2d 191, 210 (App. 1999) 
(citations omitted). In Ito, we noted that "we have no way of knowing the extent and nature of [the officer's] HGN training, whether [the officer's] training was supervised by certified instructors, whether [the officer] was certified to administer the test, and whether [the officer] received periodic retraining to refresh himself on his HGN test administration skills." Id. 
Similarly, here, the State failed to lay a sufficient foundation that Officer Nakamoto was qualified to conduct and grade the HGN evidence. Therefore, the District Court erred in admitting the HGN test results. 
(2) Partin contends that the District Court erred in
 
admitting the HGN test results as substantive evidence of
 impairment. In light of our conclusion above that the HGN
 results were improperly admitted, we do not reach the question of
 whether the HGN results were improperly admitted as substantive

evidence.
 
(3) Because the other evidence of Partin's impairment
 
was not overwhelming, the erroneous admission of the HGN results
 
was not harmless.
 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment and Notice of
 
Entry of Judgment, filed on May 27, 2015 in the District Court of
 the Third Circuit is vacated to the extent that it entered
 judgment on Count 1, and the case is remanded for a new trial on
 that count.
