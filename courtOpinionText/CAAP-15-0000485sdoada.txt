OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
G.L., Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
D.L., Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(FC-D NO. 08-1-3575)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.; and
Nakamura, Chief Judge, dissenting)
Defendant-Appellant D.L. ( D.L.) appeals from the Family
Court of the First Circuit's ( Family Court's ) Order Denying
Defendant's Motion to Set Aside or Vacate ( Order Denying 2014
Motion to Set Aside), entered on April 22, 2015, and Order
Denying Defendant's Motion for Reconsideration of Order re
Defendant's Motion to Set Aside or Vacate, entered on May 26,
2015 (Order Denying 2015 Motion for Reconsideration ).1  D.L. also
seeks to challenge the Family Court's Order Denying Motion for
Post-Decree [Relief filed on] 7/11/2011 ( 2011 Order Denying DNA

Testing), entered on August 2, 2011, and Findings of Fact
[(FOFs)] and Conclusions of Law [(COLs)], entered on October 31,
2011.2
In this appeal, D.L. raises several points of error and
contends that the Family Court erred when it:  (1) denied
Defendant's Rule 60(b) Motion for Relief from Judgment Regarding
Paternity and Child Support, which was filed on July 30, 2010
(2010 Motion for Relief); (2) denied the Motion and Affidavit for
Post-Decree Relief, which D.L. filed on July 11, 2011 ( 2011
Motion for DNA Testing); (3) denied Defendant's Motion to Set
Aside or Vacate, in Part, Divorce Decree (with Children) Filed
April 6, 2009 ( 2014 Motion to Set Aside ); (4) denied Defendant's
Motion to Reconsider Order Denying Motion to Set Aside or Vacate
Filed April 22, 2015 (2015 Motion for Reconsideration ); and (5)
entered FOF 2, and COLs 6, 10, 15 and 16, which related to D.L.'s
2010 Motion for Relief and 2011 Motion for DNA Testing.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve D.L.'s points of error as follows:
On April 6, 2009, the Family Court entered a Divorce
Decree (with Children) (Decree) granting Plaintiff-Appellee G.L.
(G.L.) a divorce from D.L., and awarding physical and legal
custody of two children to G.L., with D.L. to have reasonable
2The Honorable Catherine H. Remigio presided.
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
visitation to be arranged by the parties, and D.L. to pay child
support to G.L.3
Thereafter, D.L. filed the 2010 Motion for Relief
seeking relief from the Decree regarding paternity and child
support on the grounds that he now believed, and confirmed with
diagnostic testing, that the children were not his biological
children, but instead may have been the result of an affair that
G.L. purportedly had been having with a co-worker.  D.L. argued
in essence that, as the children were very young, it would be in
their best interests to resolve the issue, so they could grow up
knowing the identity of their actual father.  After various
continuances, shortly before a trial was to be held on paternity,
D.L. filed the 2011 Motion for DNA Testing, which was denied.4 
The trial was taken off the calendar, the Family Court entered
the 2011 Order Denying DNA Testing, and D.L. filed an appeal
(First Appeal).  This court dismissed D.L.'s appeal for lack of
appellate jurisdiction because the 2011 Order Denying DNA Testing
was not a final appealable order, as it did not finally determine
the proceedings on the 2010 Motion for Relief.
Upon the dismissal of the First Appeal, however, D.L.
did not seek the entry of an appealable order on the 2010 Motion
for Relief.  Instead, in the 2014 Motion to Set Aside, D.L.
sought relief pursuant to, inter alia , Hawai#i Family Court Rules
3The Honorable Linda S. Martell presided.
4Although the record is limited on this issue, it appears that G.L.
had objections to the admissibility of D.L.'s test results, possibly based on
an assertion that D.L. could not establish that the tested samples were taken
from the parties' children.
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(HFCR) Rule 60(b)(4),5 arguing that, to the extent that it
required personal jurisdiction over D.L., the Decree should be
set aside because service of process on D.L. was defective.  D.L.
argued that the purported service of the Complaint for Divorce
and the accompanying summons while he was in the Philippines was
not authorized by rule or statute and, therefore, the Family
Court lacked jurisdiction over his person and should have
declared the Decree to be void to the extent that jurisdiction
over his person was required.  The Family Court denied the 2014
Motion to Set Aside on the grounds that the issue was waived when
D.L. submitted the 2010 Motion for Relief without raising the
service issue.
Hawai#i courts have long held that a judgment is void
if the court that rendered it "lacked jurisdiction of the subject
matter, or of the parties, or if it acted in a manner
inconsistent with due process of law."  Wagner v. World Botanical
Gardens, Inc., 126 Hawai #i 190, 195, 268 P.3d 443, 448 (App.
2011) (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing In re Genesys

reasons:

Citicorp Mortg., Inc. v. Bartolome, 94 Hawai #i 422, 430, 16 P.3d
827, 835 (App. 2000).  In addition, "[t]he determination of
whether a judgment is void is not a discretionary issue."  Id.
(internal quotation marks omitted) (citing In re Hana Ranch Co.,
3 Haw. App. 141, 146, 642 P.2d 938, 941 (1982); see also  12 James
Wm. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice § 60.44 [5] [a] at
60-163 (3d ed. 2011)).  Thus, we turn to the issue of whether the
Family Court had personal jurisdiction over D.L. when it entered
the Decree.
In order for the Family Court to exercise personal
jurisdiction over a defendant, the defendant must be served with
a copy of the summons and the complaint pursuant to HFCR Rule 4.
See, e.g., Citicorp Mortg., Inc. , 94 Hawai# i at 430, 16 P.3d at
835 (citation omitted).  HFCR Rule 4 provides, in relevant part:
Rule 4.  Process.
(a) Summons: Issuance.   Upon the filing of the
complaint, the clerk shall forthwith issue a summons and
deliver it to the plaintiff for service by a person
authorized to serve process. Upon request of the plaintiff,
separate or additional summons shall issue against any
defendant, cross-defendant, or cross-plaintiff.
 (b) Summons: Form.   The summons shall
 (1) be signed by the clerk under the seal of the
court,
(2) contain the name of the court, and the names of
the parties, and the date when issued,
(3) be directed to the defendant or cross-defendant,
(4) state the name and address of the plaintiff's or
cross-plaintiff's attorney, if any, otherwise the
plaintiff's or cross-plaintiff's address,
(5) state the time within which these rules require
the defendant or cross-defendant to appear and defend, and
shall notify the defendant or cross-defendant that, in case
of the defendant's or cross-defendant’s failure to do so,
judgment by default will be rendered against the defendant
or cross-defendant for the relief demanded in the complaint,
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(6) contain a prohibition against personal delivery
of the summons between 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. on premises
not open to the public, unless a judge of the family or
circuit courts permits, in writing on the summons, personal
delivery during those hours, and
(7) contain a warning to the person summoned that
failure to obey the summons may result in an entry of
default and default judgment.
When, under Rule 4(e) of these rules, service is made
pursuant to a statute or order, the summons or notice, or
order in lieu of summons, shall correspond to that required
by the statute or order.
(c)Summons: By whom served.   Service shall be made:
(1)anywhere in the State  by the sheriff or the
sheriff's deputy, by some other person specially appointed
by the court for that purpose, or by any person who is not a
party and is not less than 18 years of age; or
(2)in any county  by the chief of police of that
county or a duly authorized subordinate.  Subpoena, however,
shall be served as provided in Rule 45 of these rules.
(d)Summons: Personal service.   The summons and
complaint shall be served together.  The plaintiff shall
furnish the person making service with such copies as are
necessary.  Service shall be made as follows:
(1) Upon an individual other than a child or an
incompetent person,
(A) by delivering a copy of the summons and of
the complaint to the individual personally or in case
the individual cannot be found by leaving copies
thereof at the individual’s dwelling house or usual
place of abode with some person of suitable age and
discretion then residing therein or
(B) by delivering a copy of the summons and of
the complaint to an agent authorized by appointment or
by law to receive service of process.
. . . .
(9)Upon a defendant of any class referred to in
paragraph (1) . . . of this subdivision of this rule, it is
also sufficient if the summons and complaint are served in
the manner prescribed by any statute.
(e)  Summons: Other service.
(1) Whenever a statute or an order of court
provides for service upon a party not  resident of or
found within the State  of a summons, or of a notice,
or of an order in lieu of summons, service shall be
made under the circumstances and in the manner
prescribed by the statute or order.
. . . .
(f)Territorial limits of effective service.   All
process may be served anywhere within the State and, when a 
6NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
statute or order so provides, beyond the limits of the
State.
(g) Return.  The person serving the process shall
make proof of service thereof to the court promptly and in
any event within the time during which the person served
must respond to process.  When service is made by any person
specially appointed by the court, that person shall make an
affidavit or declaration of such service.
(Bold and underlined emphasis added).
Virtually all of the HFCR Rule 4 requirements that
pertain to service outside of Hawai #i were simply disregarded in
this case.  HFCR Rule 4(c) identifies a variety of persons who
can make service in the State .  HFCR Rule 4(g) allows that a
person can otherwise be specially appointed by the court to make
service, but in that case, that person shall make an affidavit or
declaration of such service.  HFCR Rule (d)(9) recognizes that
service on an individual is also sufficient if it is performed in
the manner prescribed by any statute.  HFCR Rule 4(e) controls
the procedures when a statute or court order provides for service
on a party not found within the State and provides that service
shall be  made "under the circumstances and in the manner
prescribed by the statute or order."  HFCR Rule 4(f) further
defines the territorial limits of effective service and provides
that "when a statute or order so provides" process may be served
beyond the limits of the State.  In addition, the final paragraph
of HFCR Rule 4(b) mandates that, when out-of-state service is
made pursuant to a statute or order, under Rule 4(e), the summons
(or notice or order) shall correspond to that required by the
statute or order.  
7NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Accordingly, service outside the State is effective
only when done pursuant to a statute or court order, and in
compliance with the above-referenced parts of HFCR Rule 4.  
G.L. did not seek an order from the Family Court.6  Nor
did G.L. comply with the statutory provisions applicable to
service of a divorce complaint on a person outside the State.  
Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 580-3 (2006) sets forth
the requirements for service of a complaint for divorce and
summons.  Of relevance here, HRS § 580-3(a) through (c) provide:
§ 580-3 Service.   (a) The complaint for annulment,
divorce, or separation, and the summons shall be served by
an authorized process server on the defendant personally if
the defendant is within the State, unless the defendant
enters an appearance in the case, and except as hereinafter
otherwise provided.
 (b) If service by an authorized process server is
not feasible or is inconvenient or if the defendant is
without the State, the court may authorize  the service to be
made by any other responsible person, or the court may
authorize  notice of the pendency of the action and of a time
and place of hearing, which shall be not less than twenty
days after the giving of personal notice, to be given to the
defendant personally by such person and in such manner as
the court shall designate  and the case may be heard and
determined at or after the time specified in the notice.
(c) If the defendant is without the circuit, the
court may authorize  service by registered or certified mail,
with request for a return receipt and direction to deliver
to addressee only.  The return receipt signed by the
defendant shall be prima facie evidence that the defendant
accepted delivery of the complaint and summons on the date
set forth on the receipt.  Actual receipt by the defendant
of the complaint and summons sent by registered or certified
mail shall be equivalent to personal service on the
defendant by an authorized process server as of the date of
the receipt.
(Emphasis added).
6In G.L.'s Affidavit of Plaintiff (for Uncontested Divorce), she
represented to the Family Court, under oath, that D.L. was "personally served
. . . by a person authorized to serve of [sic] legal documents."  This
representation is clearly contradicted by the record in this case.  
8NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
HRS § 580-3.5 (2006) further provides:
§ 580-3.5  Personal judgment against absent defendant.  
In any proceeding in the family court, the court shall have
the power to render a personal judgment against a party who
is outside of this State and over whom jurisdiction is
acquired by service of process in the manner set forth in
section 580-3(b) or (c), if the party was personally served
with a copy of the summons or order to show cause and
complaint or other pleading upon which the judgment is based
and if the party was a domiciliary of this State (1) at the
time that the cause of action which is the subject of the
proceeding arose, or (2) at the time of the commencement of
the proceeding, or (3) at the time of service.
These statutes clearly and unambigously prescribe how
to serve a defendant that is out-of-state and when a Hawai# i
court "shall have the power to render a personal judgment against
a party who is outside of this State."  Pursuant to HRS § 580-3,
there are various ways to effect service outside of Hawai# i, all
of which require court authorization.  HRS § 580-3.5 confirms
that personal jurisdiction exists when service is effected in
accordance with HRS § 580-3, and one of the other factors stated
therein is met.
Here, although it appears that D.L. received a copy of
the Complaint and Summons, the purported service did not comply
in any way with the rules and statutes applicable to out-of-state
service.  Because service of the Complaint and Summons was not
properly made upon D.L., the Family Court did not have
jurisdiction over his person.  See, e.g., Heth v. Heth , 661
S.W.2d 303, 304–05 (Tex. App. 1983) ("where a defendant has not
been served in the manner required by law, the court's
jurisdiction is not invoked notwithstanding actual notice of the
suit on the part of the defendant"); Holly v. Holly, 151 S.W.3d
9NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
148, 150 (Mo. Ct. App. 2004) ("Although a party may receive
notice that satisfies the minimum standards of due process, this
alone does not obviate the necessity of serving process in the
manner prescribed in our statutes and rules. Absent proper
service, any judgment rendered over a party is void.") (citations
and internal quotation marks omitted); Guen v. Guen, 38 Md. App.
578, 585–86, 381 A.2d 721, 726 (1978) (in Maryland, the plaintiff
must do more than satisfy the due process requirement; the
plaintiff must serve the defendant in accordance with the
applicable rules, or the court will fail to acquire jurisdiction
over the defendant);  Matthews v. SBA, Inc., 149 Conn. App. 513,
539, 89 A.3d 938, 956–57 (2014) (rejecting argument that the
defendant had notice; holding that proper service of process is
not some mere technicality).  
As stated above, "[t]he determination of whether a
judgment is void is not a discretionary issue."  Wagner, 126
Hawai#i at 195, 268 P.3d at 448.  A court lacks jurisdiction if
service upon a defendant was not effected properly and a default
judgment based on defective service is void.  Thus, those
portions of the Decree requiring an exercise of personal
jurisdiction are void. 
Nevertheless, in the Order Denying 2014 Motion to Set
Aside, the Family Court concluded that D.L. waived the personal
jurisdiction argument when he failed to raise it in the 2010
Motion for Relief, which was filed after the entry of the Decree. 
Hawai#i recognizes that the defense of insufficiency of service
10NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
of process can be waived if not properly raised or by generally
appearing and participating in a case.  See HFCR Rule 12(h)(1);
see also, e.g., In re Guardianship of Carlsmith, 113 Hawai #i 211,
216, 151 P.3d 692, 697 (2006); Puckett v. Puckett, 94 Hawai# i
471, 480, 16 P.3d 876, 885 (App. 2000).  However, these
authorities do not support the proposition that a void judgment
can be resurrected or reinstated by such waiver.  The Hawai #i
Supreme Court has stated:  "[v]oid means null; ineffectual,
unable, in law, to support the purpose for which it was intended;
an instrument or transaction which is wholly ineffective,
inoperative, and incapable of ratification and which thus has no
force or effect so that nothing can cure it."  Beneficial Haw.
Inc. v. Kida, 96 Hawai# i 289, 319, 30 P.3d 895, 925 (2001)
(Acoba, J., concurring) (citation, quotation marks, brackets, and
ellipses omitted).  A void judgment is unenforceable and has no
legal effect or force of law.  Therefore, we conclude that the
nullity of a void judgment is not waived by an appearance post-
judgment.  See also Wagner, 126 Hawai# i at 196-97, 268 P.3d at
449-50 (citing multiple authorities for the proposition that,
when a judgment is void, a court must set it aside under Rule
60(b)(4), without regard to any other factors).  Therefore, we
conclude that the Family Court erred when it denied the 2014
Motion to Set Aside.  
D.L. does not challenge the Family Court's personal
jurisdiction over G.L. and in rem jurisdiction to dissolve the
parties' marriage.  However, personal jurisdiction over D.L. is
11NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
required to adjudicate spousal support, child custody,
visitation, and child support.  See Walker v. Walker, 10 Haw.
App. 361, 366, 873 P.2d 114, 116–17 (1994); Rodrigues v.
Rodrigues
, 7 Haw. App. 102, 108, 747 P.2d 1281, 1286 (1987).  In
addition, the Family Court must have in personam jurisdiction
over D.L. to adjudicate paternity.  See, e.g. , Bershaw v.
Sarbacher, 40 Wash. App. 653, 657, 700 P.2d 347, 349 (1985);
Bartlett v. Superior Court , 86 Cal. App. 3d 72, 77, 150 Cal.
Rptr. 25, 28 (1978) ("Here the party seeking to collect child
support will be obliged to prove the disputed fact of paternity
in a court having jurisdiction over the defendant."); Sena v.
Sena, 709 So. 2d 48, 50 (Ala. Civ. App. 1998).  D.L. sought
relief from items 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, and 12 of the Decree, all of
which required jurisdiction over his person and are therefore
void.  We conclude that the Family Court erred in denying D.L.
the requested relief from items 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, and 12 of the
Decree.
Finally, D.L. did not seek the entry of an appealable
order on the 2010 Motion for Relief, in conjunction with the 2014
Motion to Set Aside, and none was entered.  Therefore, we lack
appellate jurisdiction over the 2011 Order Denying DNA Testing
and the FOFs and COLs, entered on October 31, 2011, and D.L.'s
appeal is dismissed as to these orders.  However, in light of the
change in the procedural posture of this case, the dismissal of
D.L.'s challenge to these orders is without prejudice to further
Family Court proceedings on the merits of the disputed issues.
12NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
For these reasons, the Family Court's Order Denying
2014 Motion to Set Aside and Order Denying 2015 Motion for
Reconsideration are vacated, items 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, and 12 of
the Decree are set aside, and this case is remanded to the Family
Court for further proceedings consistent with this Summary
Disposition Order.
