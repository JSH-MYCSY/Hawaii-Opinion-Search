APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 15—1-0071)

 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Plaintiffs-Appellants Morteza Khaleghi and Karen
 
Khaleghi (together, the Khaleghis) appeal from the "Amended
 
Judgment" entered on June 24, 2015 in the Circuit Court of the
 
1
Second Circuit  (circuit court).
 
On appeal, the Khaleghis contend the circuit court
 
erred in:
 
(1) granting the Hawai 'i Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP) Rule 11 motion submitted by Defendants-Appellees Indymac
 Venture, LLC (Indymac) and One West Bank, FSB (together,
Appellees);
 
(2)
 dismissing the Khaleghis' claims as a HRCP Rule 11

sanction;
 
(3) converting Appellees' HRCP Rule 11 motion into a
 
HRCP Rule 12(b)(6) motion;
 
(4) concluding that the Khaleghis' claims were barred
 
by res judicata and collateral estoppel;
 
(5) dismissing the Khaleghi's claims with prejudice;
 
(6) denying the Khaleghis an opportunity to file an
 
amended complaint; and
 
(7) applying Hawai 'i law instead of California law to 
the Khaleghis' deficiency judgment.
I. BACKGROUND2
 
The Khaleghis purchased real property on the island of
 
Maui in April 2007 (Property). The Khaleghis executed a note and
 
mortgage with Indymac Bank, FSB (Indymac Bank) in connection with
 
the purchase of the Property. As the result of Indymac Bank's
 
insolvency, some of Indymac Bank's assets, including the
 Khaleghis' note and mortgage, were assigned to Indymac around
 August 2009.
 
Around March 2009, the Khaleghis defaulted on their
 
loan. Indymac exercised its option to accelerate on the loan and
 demanded immediate repayment of the principal balance from the
 Khaleghis.
 
On July 15, 2009, Indymac filed an action for
 
foreclosure on the Property. The Khaleghis allege that they were
 not given adequate notice of the foreclosure action, and the
 circuit court entered summary judgment in favor of Indymac in the
 Khaleghis' absence. The Khaleghis moved for relief from the
 judgment under HRCP Rule 60(b), but were denied relief. On July
 22, 2011, the Khaleghis filed an appeal from the circuit court's
 denial of their HRCP Rule 60(b) motion for relief and HRCP Rule
 54(b)-certified judgment confirming the sale of the Khaleghis'
 
2 We review the circuit court's dismissal of the Khaleghis' claims under
HRCP Rule 12(b)(6), and as such, we take the allegations in the complaint as
true. See Blair v. Ing, 95 Hawai' i 247, 252, 21 P.3d 452, 457 (2001). This 
factual background is taken primarily from the allegations in the Khaleghis'complaint.

0000560, CAAP-11-0000843 at 1 (App. July 25, 2014) (SDO). This
 
court affirmed the circuit court's order and judgment. Id. at 3.
 
On February 13, 2015, in the instant case the Khaleghis
 
filed a separate complaint in circuit court alleging two claims
 of unfair and deceptive acts or practices under Hawaii Revised
 
3
Statutes (HRS) § 480-2 (2008 Repl.)  and one claim of unjust
enrichment.
 
In a letter dated March 16, 2015 sent to counsel for
 
the Khaleghis, Appellees requested the dismissal of the
 
Khaleghis' complaint pursuant to HRCP Rule 11.4
 
3 HRS § 480-2(a) provides:
 
§480-2 Unfair competition, practices, declared
unlawful.  (a) Unfair methods of competition and unfair or
deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or
commerce are unlawful.
 
4 HRCP Rule 11 provides, in pertinent part:
 
Rule 11.	 SIGNING OF PLEADINGS, MOTIONS, AND OTHER PAPERS;
REPRESENTATIONS TO THE COURT; SANCTIONS.
 
. . . .
 
(b) Representations to court. By presenting to the
court (whether signing, filing, submitting, or later
advocating) a pleading, written motion, or other paper, an
attorney or unrepresented party is certifying that to the
best of the person's knowledge, information, and belief,
formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances:
 
(1) it is not being presented for any improper
purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or
needless increase in the cost of litigation;
 
(2) the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions
therein are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous
argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of
existing law or the establishment of new law;
 
(3) the allegations and other factual contentions have
evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, are
likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable
opportunity for further investigation or discovery; and 
(4) the denials of factual contentions are warranted
on the evidence or, if specifically so identified, are
reasonably based on a lack of information or belief.

On April 6, 2015, the Khaleghis filed their "First
 
Amended Complaint," (Amended Complaint) which included only one
 
count of unfair and deceptive acts or practices and the unjust
 
enrichment claim.
 
On April 10, 2015, Appellees filed "Defendants Indymac
 
Venture, LLC and OneWest Bank, N.A.'s Motion to Dismiss
 Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint with Prejudice Under Rule 11
 or in the Alternative for Summary Judgment on all Claims, and for
 an Award of Sanctions" (Appellees' HRCP Rule 11 Motion). The
 
circuit court held a hearing on their motion on April 30, 2015.
 
On May 13, 2015, the circuit court entered an order
 
granting in part and denying in part Appellees' HRCP Rule 11
 
Motion. The circuit court granted Appellees' request to dismiss
 the Khaleghis' Amended Complaint with prejudice, stating, "As a
 procedural matter, the Court treats [Appellees' HRCP Rule 11]
 Motion as a motion to dismiss under HRCP Rule 12. Given the
 complicated and confusing document title, the Court feels that
 the best course of action would be to treat it as such." The
 circuit court then denied Appellees' request for sanctions.
 
The circuit court entered its judgment on May 26, 2015,
 
and an amended judgment on June 24, 2015.

opportunity to respond, the court determines that
subdivision (b) has been violated, the court may, subject to
the conditions stated below, impose an appropriate sanction
upon the attorneys, law firms, or parties that have violated
subdivision (b) or are responsible for the violation.
 
(1) HOW INITIATED.
 
(A) By Motion.  A motion for sanctions under this rule
 
shall be made separately from other motions or requests and
shall describe the specific conduct alleged to violate
subdivision (b). It shall be served as provided in Rule 5,
but shall not be filed with or presented to the court
unless, within 21 days after service of the motion (or such
other period as the court may prescribe), the challenged
paper, claim, defense, contention, allegation, or denial is
not withdrawn or appropriately corrected. If warranted, the
court may award to the party prevailing on the motion the
reasonable expenses and attorney's fees incurred in
presenting or opposing the motion. Absent exceptional
circumstances, a law firm shall be held jointly responsible
for violations committed by its partners, associates, and
employees.

The Khaleghis filed their notice of appeal on June 25,
 
2015.
 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
A. HRCP Rule 11 Motion for Sanctions
 
"All aspects of a HRCP Rule 11 determination should be
 
reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard." Gap v. Puna
 
Geothermal Venture, 106 Hawai 'i 325, 331, 104 P.3d 912, 918 
(2004) (quoting Canalez v. Bob's Appliance Serv. Ctr., Inc., 89
 
Hawai'i 292, 300, 972 P.2d 295, 303 (1999)). "The trial court 
abuses its discretion if it bases its ruling on an erroneous view
 of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence." 
Gap, 106 Hawai
'i at 331, 104 P.3d at 918 (quoting Canalez, 89 
Hawai'i at 299, 972 P.2d at 302).
B. HRCP Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss
 
It is well settled that:
 
A complaint should not be dismissed for failure to
state a claim unless it appears beyond a doubt that
the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of
his or her claim that would entitle him or her to
 relief. Ravelo v. [Cty.] of Hawaii, 66 Haw. 194, 198,
658 P.2d 883, 886 (1983) (quoting Midkiff v. Castle &
Cooke, Inc., 45 Haw. 409, 414, 368 P.2d 887, 890
(1962)); Marsland v. Pang, 5 Haw. App. 463, 474, 701
P.2d 175, 185-86, cert. denied, 67 Haw. 686, 744 P.2d
781 (1985). We must therefore view a plaintiff's
complaint in a light most favorable to him or her in
order to determine whether the allegations contained
therein could warrant relief under any alternative
theory. Ravelo, 66 Haw. at 199, 658 P.2d at 886. For
 
this reason, in reviewing a circuit court's order
dismissing a complaint[,] our consideration is
strictly limited to the allegations of the complaint,
and we must deem those allegations to be true. Au v.
 
Au, 63 Haw. 210, 214, 626 P.2d 173, 177 (1981).
 
Baehr v. Lewin, 74 Haw. 530, 545, 852 P.2d 44, 52,
reconsideration granted in part and denied in part, 74 Haw.
650, 875 P.2d 225 (1993).
 
Blair, 95 Hawai 'i at 252, 21 P.3d at 457 (brackets omitted) 
(quoting Touchette v. Ganal, 82 Hawai 'i 293, 297-98, 922 P.2d 
347, 351-52 (1996)).
 
III. DISCUSSION

 
The Khaleghis make a number of arguments related to
 
whether Appellees complied with HRCP Rule 11 and whether HRCP
 
Rule 11 permitted the court to dismiss the Khaleghis' claims. 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
However, because the circuit court treated Appellees' HRCP Rule
 
5
11 Motion as an HRCP Rule 12(b)(6)  motion, we address first the
Khaleghis' contention that the circuit court improperly converted
 
Appellees' HRCP Rule 11 Motion.6
 
The Khaleghis argue that there was no authority for the
 
circuit court to treat an HRCP Rule 11 motion as a motion to
 dismiss under HRCP Rule 12(b)(6). In addressing the conversion,
 the circuit court cited no authority and stated simply, "As a
 procedural matter, the Court treats [Appellees' HRCP Rule 11]
 Motion as a motion to dismiss under [HRCP] Rule 12. Given the
 complicated and confusing document title, the Court feels that
 the best course of action would be to treat it as such."
 
5 HRCP Rule 12(b)(6) provides:
 
Rule 12. DEFENSES AND OBJECTIONS –- WHEN AND HOW
 
PRESENTED –- BY PLEADING OR MOTION –- MOTION FOR
 
JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS.
 
. . . .

 
(b) How presented. Every defense, in law or fact, to
a claim for relief in any pleading, whether a claim,
counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, shall be
asserted in the responsive pleading thereto if one is
required, except that the following defenses may at the
option of the pleader be made by motion: . . . (6) failure
to state a claim upon which relief can be granted[.] . . . A
motion making any of these defenses shall be made before
pleading if a further pleading is permitted. No defense or
 objection is waived by being joined with one or more other
defenses or objections in a responsive pleading or motion.
If a pleading sets forth a claim for relief to which the
adverse party is not required to serve a responsive
pleading, the adverse party may assert at the trial any
defense in law or fact to that claim for relief. If, on a
motion asserting the defense numbered (6) to dismiss for
failure of the pleading to state a claim upon which relief
can be granted, matters outside the pleading are presented
to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be
treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as
provided in Rule 56, and all parties shall be given
reasonable opportunity to present all material made
pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56.
 
6 Appellees argue that the Khaleghis did not object to the circuit
court's treatment of Appellees' HRCP Rule 11 Motion as an HRCP Rule 12 motion
to dismiss, but the transcript of the hearing indicates that the circuit court
announced its intention to treat Appellees' motion as an HRCP Rule 12 motion
to dismiss at the end of the hearing without providing the Khaleghis an
opportunity to object. Until the circuit court announced its ruling, neither
party had addressed whether Appellees' motion should be treated as an HRCP
Rule 12 motion to dismiss.
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Appellees suggest the circuit court was within its 
discretion to treat their motion as a HRCP Rule 12(b)(6) motion. 
Appellees cite Madden v. Madden, 43 Haw. 148 (Haw. Terr. 1959) for the proposition that "the substance rather than the label of the motion controls as long as the opposing party is put on notice of the issues and given a chance to respond." See id. at 
149-50 ("Under the rules, the substance of the pleading controls, not the nomenclature given to the pleading."); see also Tanaka v. Dep't of Hawaiian Home Lands, 106 Hawai
'i 246, 251, 103 P.3d 406, 
411 (App. 2004) ("It is true that it is the substance of the pleading that controls, not its nomenclature." (citing Anderson v. Oceanic Props., Inc., 3 Haw. App. 350, 355, 650 P.2d 612, 617
 (1982))).
 
In Appellees' HRCP Rule 11 Motion, Appellees requested
 
an order dismissing the Khaleghis' Amended Complaint with
 prejudice on the grounds that the Khaleghis "asserted frivolous
 claims in the [Amended] Complaint. [The Khaleghis] have no
 objective factual or legal basis for the claims." Appellees
 argued that the Khaleghis' claims for unfair and deceptive
 practices and unjust enrichment "are frivolous as they are
 without question precluded by the doctrines of res judicata and
 collateral estoppel." Appellees described the Khaleghis'
 complaint as "a frivolous and shameless attempt to re-litigate
 claims and defenses that were already finally decided in
 [Indymac's] 2009 foreclosure action[.]"
 
The Khaleghis' opposition motion recognized that
 
Appellees' HRCP Rule 11 Motion should have been brought under
 HRCP Rule 12 as a motion to dismiss, but given the nature of the
 motion focused on the procedure required by HRCP Rule 11 and the
 standard set by HRCP Rule 11. The Khaleghis argued that their
 claims were not frivolous by attacking Appellees' res judicata
 and collateral estoppel defenses. The Khaleghis' opposition
 highlighted the purpose of HRCP Rule 11, stating, "[HRCP] Rule 11
 is designed to prevent the filing of a complaint without a
 prerequisite investigation into both the law and the facts."
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
The parties' arguments to the circuit court were
 
focused on whether res judicata and collateral estoppel so
 
obviously barred the Khaleghis' claims that these claims were
 frivolous and sanctionable under HRCP Rule 11. In contrast, the
 circuit court evaluated and resolved Appellees' HRCP Rule 11
 Motion on the sufficiency of the Khaleghis' claims to support
 entitlement to relief. In large part, the circuit court
 
7
dismissed the Khaleghis' claims as barred by res judicata,  but
the circuit court also dismissed parts of the Khaleghis'
 complaint without having given the Khaleghis an opportunity to
 defend their allegations. For example, the circuit court stated,
 "[The Khaleghis allege that they] were entitled to notice that
 they may be subject to a deficiency judgment. The Court finds
 that these statements to be conclusory allegations and cannot
 support a claim for which relief can be granted." The circuit
 court dismissed another allegation in the Khaleghis' complaint,
 stating, "[The Khaleghis'] contention that the fair market value
 of the property is $3.4 million is a legal conclusion and not
 accepted as true." Finally, the circuit court summarily
 dismissed the Khaleghis' remaining allegations, stating, "The
 Court further rules that [the Khaleghis'] remaining allegations
 fail to support a claim for which relief can be granted. These
 allegations fail to state, with specificity, any conduct or
 supporting facts that support a claim for relief."
 
While we agree that it is the substance of a motion

 
that should control rather than the title of the motion, in this
 case, the substance of Appellees' HRCP Rule 11 Motion for
 
7 We note that while HRCP Rule 12(b)(6) motions are typically limited to
the allegations contained in the pleadings, in some cases, a court may
properly dismiss a claim under HRCP Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claimwhere the claim is barred by res judicata or collateral estoppel. See Blair, 
95 Hawai' i at 252, 21 P.3d at 457 ("[O]ur consideration is strictly limited to
the allegations of the complaint, and we must deem those allegations to betrue." (quoting Baehr, 74 Haw. at 545, 852 P.2d at 52)); but cf. Caires v.Kualoa Ranch, Inc., 6 Haw. App. 52, 55 n.4, 708 P.2d 848, 850 n.4 (1985)("Where the defense of res judicata 'appears on the face of the complaint orfrom the taking of judicial notice or prior interrelated proceedings which arealluded to in the complaint, such defense may be raised by a motion to dismissunder [HRCP] Rule 12(b)(6).'" (quoting Ellis v. Crockett, 51 Haw. 45, 55, 451P.2d 814, 821 (1969))).

sanctions was substantially different than an HRCP Rule 12(b)(6)
 
Motion to dismiss. The Khaleghis did not have an adequate
 opportunity to defend the sufficiency of the allegations in their
 Amended Complaint before the circuit court announced its
 intention to treat Appellees' motion as a motion to dismiss. The
 circuit court abused its discretion in treating Appellees' HRCP 
Rule 11 Motion for sanctions as an HRCP Rule 12(b)(6) motion to
 dismiss. Because we vacate and remand on these grounds, we need
 not address the Khaleghis' other contentions on appeal.
IV. CONCLUSION
 
Therefore, the "Amended Judgment" entered on June 24,
 
2015 in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit is vacated and
 this case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this
 opinion.
