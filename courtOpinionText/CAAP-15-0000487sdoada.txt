On appeal, Mattos contends3
 the District Court erred by
denying his pretrial Motion to Suppress because there was no
 
justification for executing the traffic stop which subsequently
 led to the discovery that he was OVUII.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Mattos's point of error as follows:
 
The District Court did not err by denying the Motion to
 
Suppress when all of the evidence adduced at trial is considered.
 
[W]hen the defendant’s pretrial motion to suppress is
denied and the evidence is subsequently introduced at
trial, the defendant’s appeal of the denial of the
motion to suppress is actually an appeal of the
introduction of the evidence at trial. Consequently,
when deciding an appeal of the pretrial denial of the
defendant’s motion to suppress, the appellate court
considers both the record of the hearing on the motion
to suppress and the record of the trial.

2001) (citations omitted); see also Carroll v. United States, 267
 
U.S. 132, 162 (1925).
 
Mattos contends on appeal, as he did below, that
 
evidence resulting from his traffic stop should be suppressed
 because there was no traffic sign indicating that the street he
 was exiting onto from a parking lot was "one-way" and, therefore,
 he did not know he violated any traffic law by going in the
 opposite direction. Mattos claims that "one cannot be prosecuted
 
3 Mattos's Opening Brief is in violation of Hawai' i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4) insofar as it does not provide record
citations for the challenged actions of the District Court nor for thepreservation of these errors for appeal. "[S]uch noncompliance offerssufficient grounds for the dismissal of the appeal." Housing Fin. & Dev.Corp. v. Ferguson, 91 Hawai' i 81, 85, 979 P.2d 1107, 1111 (1999). See also 
Schefke v. Reliable Collection Agency, Ltd., 96 Hawai' i 408, 420, 32 P.3d 52,

(1995). Counsel is cautioned that future violations of the rules may resultin sanctions. 
Nevertheless, we recognize that our appellate courts have
"consistently adhered to the policy of affording litigants the opportunity tohave their cases heard on the merits, where possible," Schefke, 96 Hawai' i at 
420, 32 P.3d at 64 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted; emphasissupplied), and in several instances have addressed the merits of an appeal,noncompliance with the appellate rules notwithstanding.

Diocese of Honolulu, 77 Hawai' i 383, 386, 885 P.2d 361, 364 (1994).
Therefore, we will endeavor to do so here, to the extent possible.

for a one-way street violation if required signs are absent." We
 
need not address Mattos's legal argument because the evidence at
 trial demonstrated that Mattos saw a one-way traffic sign at the
 exit of the parking lot.
 
During the hearing on Mattos's Motion to Suppress,
 
there was no evidence presented that there was a traffic sign
 near the parking lot exit that stated the street was a one-way
 street. However, during trial, Mattos admitted that there was a
 one-way sign facing the exit of the parking lot. At trial,
 Mattos claimed that he did not drive in the opposite direction of
 the sign because he drove straight across the street into a gas
 station. Thus, there was evidence presented that Mattos knew of
 the south bound direction of traffic on the street when he exited
 the parking lot. Officer Nephi Laga testified that not only did
 Mattos disregard the one-way sign and drive in the opposite
 direction, Mattos drove for approximately 50 feet in the opposite
 direction before veering into the driveway of a nearby business. 
The stop of Mattos was justified based on this traffic violation.
 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment and Notice of
 
Entry of Judgment, entered on June 10, 2015 in the District Court
 of the Second Circuit, Wailuku Division is affirmed.
