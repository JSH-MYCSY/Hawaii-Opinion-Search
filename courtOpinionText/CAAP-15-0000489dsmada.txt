OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
BARBARA LEE, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
ROBERT YOUNG, OF COATES & FREY, Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 1RC14-1-7964)
 
ORDER DISMISSING THE APPEAL
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that:
 
(1) On August 26, 2015, the court issued an order to
 
show cause to Plaintiff-Appellant Barbara Lee (Appellant), pro
 se, to explain why the appeal should not be dismissed for failure
 to pay the filing fee or obtain a fee waiver. The court
 cautioned Appellant that failure to timely respond to the order
 or to show good cause may result in dismissal of the appeal;
 
(2) That same day, the appellate clerk mailed the order
 
to show cause to Appellant at the post office box listed in the
 record on appeal and amended record on appeal filed on August 19,
 2015;

(3) On September 1, 2015, the United States Postal
 
Service returned the envelope because Appellant's post office box
 
had been closed and the post office was unable to forward the
 notice; and
 
(4) Appellant took no further action in this appeal.
 Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is
 
dismissed.
