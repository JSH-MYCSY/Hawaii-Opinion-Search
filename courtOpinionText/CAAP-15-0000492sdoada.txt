STATE OF HAWAI #I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
BERNARD TULENSA, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CR. NO. 14-1-0591)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Fujise, Acting C.J., Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Bernard Tulensa (Tulensa) appeals
from the June 4, 2015 Judgment of Conviction and Probation
Sentence entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
(Circuit Court).1  Tulensa was convicted of Assault in the Second
Degree, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707-
711(1)(b) (2014).2
Tulensa appeals his conviction, arguing that there was
insufficient evidence of serious bodily injury and that the
Circuit Court plainly erred in failing to instruct the jury on
the lesser included offense of Assault in the Third Degree.
1The Honorable Karen S.S. Ahn presided.
2A person commits the offense of assault in the second
degree if:
(a) The person intentionally or knowingly causes
substantial bodily injury to another; [or]
(b) The person recklessly causes serious or substantial
bodily injury to another[.]
HRS § 707-711 (2014).NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
After a careful review of the points raised and
arguments made by the parties, the record, and the applicable
authority, we resolve Tulensa's points as follows and affirm.
1.  There was sufficient evidence to support Tulensa's
conviction for Assault in the Second Degree.  Tulensa challenges
only the jury's finding that he recklessly caused serious bodily
injury to the complaining witness (CW).  "'Serious bodily injury'
means bodily injury which creates a substantial risk of death or
which causes serious, permanent disfigurement, or protracted loss
or impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ." 
HRS § 707-700 (2014).  On appeal, the standard for evaluating the
sufficiency of the evidence is whether there was substantial
evidence.  "'Substantial evidence' as to every material element
of the offense charged is credible evidence which is of
sufficient quality and probative value to enable a [person] of
reasonable caution to support a conclusion."  State v. Batson , 73
Haw. 236, 248-49, 831 P.2d 924, 931 (1992) (citation omitted).
CW's treating physician testified that CW's actual
injury was "blunt intracranial hemorrhage," or "bruising of the
brain" and that CW sustained three bruises, one each on the left
temporal lobe, the parietal lobe, and the right parietal lobe,
with the largest bruise measuring seven millimeters.  The doctor
went on to explain that "these areas of bleeding [could] continue
to bleed and the brain to swell to the point where he could die"
and that the injury created a substantial risk of death.
When considered in the strongest light for the
prosecution, State v. Matavale , 115 Hawai #i 149, 157, 166 P.3d
322, 330 (2007), the testimony presented provided credible
evidence of sufficient quality and probative value to support the
conclusion that Tulensa inflicted serious bodily injury upon CW. 
2. The Circuit Court did not plainly err when it did
not instruct the jury on the offense of Assault in the Third
Degree because there was no rational basis in the evidence for
such an instruction.  See State v. Flores , 131 Hawai# i 43, 51,
314 P.3d 120, 128 (2013).  Tulensa argues that the jury should
have been instructed on the offense of Assault in the Third
Degree for negligently causing bodily injury with a dangerous
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
instrument under HRS § 707-712(1)(b) (2014).
"Dangerous instrument" means any firearm, whether loaded or
not, and whether operable or not, or other weapon, device,
instrument, material, or substance, whether animate or
inanimate, which in the manner it is used or is intended to
be used is known to be capable of producing death or serious
bodily injury.
HRS § 707-700 (2014).
However, Tulensa does not identify what "dangerous
instrument" the evidence established he employed.  To the extent
he implies the concrete floor upon which CW hit his head could
qualify as a dangerous instrument, that proposition has been
rejected.  U.S. v. Vasquez , 843 F. Supp. 2d 1147, 1150 (D. Or.
2012) (dismissing charge under federal assault statute where
defendant lifted victim and slammed victim to the floor head
first "likely" causing victim serious bodily injury because
defendant's action was "nothing more than a 'body slam'"
punishable under another statute, and "as a matter of law . . .
the floor cannot be a dangerous weapon as alleged[.]")  Tulensa 
provides no authority in support of his proposition.  
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the June 4, 2015
Judgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence of the Circuit
Court of the First Circuit.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, March 7, 2018.
