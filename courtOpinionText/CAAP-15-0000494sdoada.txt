BRUCE EDWARD COX, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
CARLYN DAVIDSON COX, Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-D NO. 06-1-0096)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Bruce Edward Cox (Husband) appeals
 
from the June 2, 2015 Order After Remand Hearing (Order After
 
Remand) entered by the Family Court of the First Circuit (Family
 
1
Court),  in which the Family Court declined to award Husband
attorney's fees and costs pursuant to Rule 68 of the Hawai 'i 
Family Court Rules (HFCR). As Husband argues, he timely filed an application for a writ of certiorari staying this court's April 
15, 2015 Judgment on Appeal. See Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) 41. Therefore, the Family Court lacked

jurisdiction to enter the Order After Remand, which must
 
accordingly be vacated.
 
We note, however, that the Hawai 'i Supreme Court's 
decision in Cox v. Cox, 138 Hawai 'i 476, 483, 382 P.3d 288, 295 
(2016), controls any further proceedings concerning Husband's request for attorney's fees and costs. 
The Family Court's June 2, 2015 Order After Remand is
 
vacated. This case is remanded to the Family Court.
