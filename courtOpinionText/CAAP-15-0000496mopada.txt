IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
 
ARWIN ECHINEQUE, Defendant-Appellant
 
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
 
(CR. NO. 14-1-1672)

 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Arwin Echineque (Echineque) filed,
 
 
pro se, two notices of appeal in this case following his
 
 
1

conviction in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit  (circuit
 
 
court). Although not stated in his notices of appeal, Echineque
 
 
appears to appeal from the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence
 
 
entered on June 2, 2015 in the circuit court, in which Echineque  
 
 
was convicted of assault in the third degree under Hawaii Revised
 
 
Statutes (HRS) § 707-712(1)(a) (2014 Repl.).2
 
 
On appeal, Echineque contends the circuit court erred
 
"by conducting a colloquy that was inadequate to determine
 
whether Echineque was voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently
 waiving his right to a jury trial."
 
1 The Honorable Dean E. Ochiai presided.
 
2 HRS § 707-712 provides, in pertinent part:
 
 
§707-712 Assault in the third degree. (1) A person commits

the offense of assault in the third degree if the person: 
(a) 	Intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causes
bodily injury to another person[.]

I. BACKGROUND
 
On October 21, 2014, Echineque was indicted for assault
 
in the first degree in violation of HRS § 707-710 (2014 Repl.).3
 
On February 2, 2015, Echineque submitted a signed
 
written waiver of his right to a trial by jury to the circuit
 
court.
 
The circuit court held a trial on February 27, 2015.
 
Before the trial began, Echineque confirmed that he had
 previously waived his right to a jury trial. The circuit court
 asked Echineque:
 
BY THE COURT:
 
 
Q Mr. is it Echineque?
 
 
A Yes, sir. 


Q Okay. You understand that you are here for a jury-
 
waived trial, in other words, no jury for this trial, 

just the judge?
 
 
Do you understand this?
 
 
A Yes, your Honor.
 
 
Q
	 Okay. And you previously waived your right to a jury
trial, meaning, you decided that you'd rather have a 

judge only try this case than have the matter tried 

before a jury; correct? 
 
 
A That's correct, your Honor. 
 
 
Q And that's what you want to do? 
 
 
A Yes, your Honor. 
Q Okay. . . .
 * * * 
Q All right. Mr. Echineque, I have before me a waiverof trial by jury form which appears to have yoursignature and that of your attorney. It is dated February 2, 2015. 
Did you sign this form? 
A Yes, I did, your Honor. 
Q Okay. 
And have you waived your right to a trial by
jury and consent to a trial by a court only without a
jury? 
A Yes, I have, your Honor. 
3 HRS § 707-710(1) provides, "A person commits the offense of assault in
the first degree if the person intentionally or knowingly causes serious
bodily injury to another person."

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Q Okay. And before making your decision, did you have
the benefit of speaking to your attorney so that youunderstand everything with regard to waiving yourright to a jury trial? 
A Yes, I have. 
Q Okay. Now, you understand that the Constitution ofthe State of Hawaii and the United States providesthat you have an absolute right [to] a jury trial ifyou want one? 
You understand this; right? 
A Yes, sir. 
Q Okay. Now, you also have the right to decide, and it
is your right only -- the State doesn't have thisright -- to have this trial decided by a judge only. 
You understand this? 
A Yes, your Honor. 
Q Okay. And after speaking to your attorney and seeking
his advice and counsel, did anyone force you orpromise you anything to waive your right to a jurytrial? 
A No, your Honor. 
Q Okay. Did you make that decision freely, voluntarily,and understanding what it is that you are doing? 
A Yes, I have, your Honor. 
Q And are you and your attorney in agreement with thisdecision? 
A Yes, we are, your Honor. 
Q Okay. Do you want to proceed at this time without a jury? 
A Yes, I do, your Honor. 
Q Okay. Then the Court is satisfied that you have hadthe benefit of competent trial counsel, and that youhave freely, voluntarily, and knowingly elected toproceed by a trial with a judge only and no jury.Okay. The Court will accept that. 
The circuit court announced its verdict on March 20,
 
2015, finding Echineque guilty of assault in the third degree as
 
a lesser included offense of assault in the first degree. The
 circuit court entered its Judgment of Conviction and Sentence on
 June 2, 2015.
 
Echineque submitted a notice of appeal on July 1, 2015,
 
titled, "Appeal Pursuant Under HRPP Rule 40. Claiming
 Insufficient Evidence." Echineque filed a second notice of

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appeal in this case on July 2, 2015 with the same title. We 
construe Echineque's appeal as a direct appeal from the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence, rather than as a collateral appeal under Hawai
'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40.
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
"The validity of a criminal defendant's waiver of his 
or her right to a jury trial presents a question of state and federal constitutional law." State v. Friedman, 93 Hawai
'i 63, 
67, 996 P.2d 268, 272 (2000). "We answer questions of constitutional law by exercising our own independent judgment based on the facts of the case[.]" State v. Viglielmo, 105 Hawai
'i 197, 203, 95 P.3d 952, 958 (2004) (internal quotation 
marks omitted) (quoting State v. Kaua, 102 Hawai 'i 1, 7, 72 P.3d 
473, 479 (2003)). "[Q]uestions of constitutional law are reviewed on appeal under the right/wrong standard." Viglielmo, 105 Hawai
'i at 203, 95 P.3d at 958 (internal quotation marks 
omitted) (quoting Kaua, 102 Hawai 'i at 7, 72 P.3d at 479).
III. DISCUSSION
 
"A defendant may, orally or in writing, voluntarily 
waive his or her right to a trial by jury."4 Friedman, 93 
Hawai'i at 68, 996 P.2d at 273 (citing State v. Ibuos, 75 Haw. 
118, 121, 857 P.2d 576, 578 (1993)); see HRPP Rule 23(a) ("Cases required to be tried by jury shall be so tried unless the defendant waives a jury trial with the approval of the court. The waiver shall be either by written consent filed in court or by oral consent in open court entered on the record."). "For a valid waiver of the right to a jury trial, the trial court has a

 Assault in the first degree is a class B felony. HRS § 707-710(2).
Class B felonies carry maximum sentences of up to ten years. HRS § 706­
660(1)(a) (2014 Repl.). Furthermore, the indictment stated:
 
ARWIN ECHINEQUE is subject to sentencing in accordance
with Sections 706-662(5) [(2014 Repl.)] and 706-660.2
[(Supp. 2015)] of the Hawaii Revised Statutes, where, in the
course of committing felonious assault, he inflicted serious
or substantial bodily injury upon Ester Echineque, who was
sixty years of age or older, and ARWIN ECHINEQUE knew or
reasonably should have known of such disability.
 
Under HRS § 706-661 (2014 Repl.), the maximum length of imprisonment for a
charge of assault in the first degree with an extended term of imprisonment
was twenty years. Echineque was entitled to a jury trial for his assault
charge. See State v. Shak, 51 Haw. 612, 614-16, 466 P.2d 422, 424-25 (1970).

duty to inform the accused of that constitutional right [to a 
trial by jury]." Friedman, 93 Hawai 'i at 68, 996 P.2d at 273 
(citing Ibuos, 75 Haw. at 120, 857 P.2d at 577). 
"[T]o determine whether a waiver was voluntarily and 
intelligently undertaken, [an appellate court] will look to the totality of facts and circumstances of each particular case." Friedman, 93 Hawai
'i at 68-69, 996 P.2d at 273-74 (quoting State 
v. Vares, 71 Haw. 617, 621, 801 P.2d 555, 557-58 (1990)). "Although [HRPP Rule 23(a)] indicates the waiver may be given by written or oral consent, the rule does not relieve the court of its obligation to ensure, through an appropriate oral colloquy in court, that the waiver was knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily given." State v. Gomez-Lobato, 130 Hawai
'i 465, 469, 
312 P.3d 897, 901 (2013). "In other words, while the defendant may execute a written waiver form, the court should also engage in an oral colloquy with the defendant to establish that the waiver was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary." Id. "Where it 
appears from the record that a defendant has voluntarily waived a constitutional right to a jury trial, the defendant carries the burden of demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that his/her waiver was involuntary." Friedman, 93 Hawai
'i at 69, 996 
P.2d at 274. 
Because Echineque waived his right to trial by jury
 
during a colloquy with the circuit court, Echineque "bears the
 burden of demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that
 his oral waiver was involuntarily given." Id. at 69, 996 P.2d at
 
274.
 
Echinque argues on appeal, "the circuit court's
 
 
colloquy with Echineque was constitutionally lacking in several
 
 
respects." Echineque explains, 
 
[T]he circuit court did not inquire into Echineque's
background and experience. No questions were asked as to
Echineque's educational or employment background, nor were
there any questions asked as to Echineque's experience with
the criminal justice system. The record is therefore
 inadequate and does not allow for a proper "totality of the
circumstances" review on appeal.
 
To support his argument, Echineque cites to Gomez-Lobato for the
 
proposition that a trial court must take into account a
 defendant's educational or employment background, or experience

with the criminal justice system before determining whether the
 
defendant was capable of knowingly, intelligently, and
 voluntarily waiving their right to a jury trial.
 
Gomez-Lobato involved a defendant charged with abuse of 
a family or household member in violation of HRS § 709-906(1) (Supp. 2015). Gomez-Lobato, 130 Hawai
'i at 467, 312 P.3d at 899. 
The defendant, Gomez-Lobato, was represented by a deputy public defender and assisted by a Spanish interpreter. Id. At Gomez­
Lobato's Entry of Plea hearing, the court recessed for Gomez-Lobato to review the waiver of jury trial form with the interpreter, and when the court reconvened, the court asked Gomez-Lobato, with the assistance of the interpreter: 
THE COURT: Good morning, Mr. Gomez Lobato. I have with me a
 
waiver of jury trial form. Are these your initials, and is
this your signature on this form?
 
Gomez-Lobato: Yes.
 THE COURT: Prior to placing your initials and signature on
this form, did you understand what you were doing and
signing?
 
Gomez-Lobato: Yes.
 THE COURT: And was that explained to you in Spanish?
 Gomez-Lobato: Yes.
 THE COURT: Did you discuss this with your attorney?
 Gomez-Lobato: Yes.
 THE COURT: Okay. Do you have any questions for me?
 Gomez-Lobato: No.
 THE COURT: Okay. The Court concludes that the defendant
 
knowingly, voluntarily, intelligently waived his rights to a
jury trial.
 
Id. (brackets omitted). The Hawai 'i Supreme Court's decision 
centered on the "language barrier" between Gomez-Lobato and the 
trial court, which the supreme court held "should have prompted the [trial] court to ask additional questions to verify that Gomez-Lobato understood the right he was waiving." Id. at 471, 
312 P.3d at 903. The supreme court noted that "where a language barrier indicates that a defendant's written waiver executed outside the presence of the judge 'might be less than knowing and intelligent,' the court should take additional steps to ensure the defendant understands the right that he or she is waiving."

Id. at 472, 312 P.3d at 904 (internal quotation marks and
 citation omitted).
 
Gomez-Lobato instructs trial courts to engage in a 
lengthier and more detailed colloquy when a defendant is not fluent in English, particularly where there is no evidence in the record as to the defendant's background, experience, and conduct. Gomez-Lobato does not require trial courts to ask all defendants about their educational or employment background, or experience with the criminal justice system, where there is no indication that a defendant's waiver "might be less than knowing and intelligent" due to an apparent language barrier. See Gomez-
Lobato, 130 Hawai
'i at 471, 312 P.3d at 903 (quoting United 
States v. Duarte-Higareda, 113 F.3d 1000, 1003 (9th Cir. 1997)). 
Echineque argues on appeal that "there could have been 
a salient fact that may have prevented Echineque from knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waiving his right to a jury trial." However, Hawai
'i appellate courts have eschewed a "rigid 
pattern of factual determinations" in favor of a totality of circumstances approach in determining whether a waiver was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. See Friedman, 93 Hawai
'i at 
69-70, 996 P.2d at 274-75. 
Echineque has not pointed to any facts in the record
 
that would suggest his waiver was not voluntary or knowing. See
 
id. at 70, 996 P.2d at 275 ("[The defendant] has failed to direct
 us to any 'salient fact' bearing upon his ability to understand
 his jury waiver that would have created the need for an extensive
 colloquy by the trial court, and, thus, his argument is without
 merit."). The colloquy between the circuit court and Echineque
 instead suggests that Echineque's waiver of his constitutional
 right to a jury trial was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. 
The record also shows that Echineque had extensive experience
 with the criminal justice system, including two prior felony
 convictions for first-degree and second-degree assault, five
 misdemeanor convictions, and five petty misdemeanor convictions,
 which resulted in his being incarcerated eight times. It also
 appears that Echineque was involved in at least one prior jury
 trial. See State v. Echineque, 73 Haw. 100, 828 P.2d 276 (1992).

Echineque was forty-eight years old, a United States citizen, a 
lifetime resident of Hawai 'i, and had graduated from high school 
and attended Honolulu Community College. Under the totality of circumstances, Echineque has not met his burden of demonstrating that his waiver was involuntary. See Friedman, 93 Hawai
'i at 70, 
996 P.2d at 275. 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
Therefore, the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence
 
entered on June 2, 2015 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
 is affirmed.
