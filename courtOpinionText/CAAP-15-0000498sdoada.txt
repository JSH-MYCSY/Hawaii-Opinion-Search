STATE OF HAWAI #I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
BILL C. GRAY, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
(CASE NO. 2DTA-14-00194)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
The State of Hawaii (State) charged Defendant-
Appellant Bill C. Gray with operating a vehicle under the
influence of an intoxicant (OVUII) (Count 1); refusal to submit
to breath, blood, or urine test (Refusal to Submit to Testing)
(Count 2); possessing intoxicating liquor in an open container
while operating a vehicle (Count 3); driving without a license
(Count 4); and leaving the scene of an accident involving
property damage (Count 5).  After a bench trial, the District
Court of the Second Circuit (District Court)1 found Gray guilty
as charged on Counts 1, 2, 4, and 5, and not guilty on Count 3.   #
Gray appeals from the District Court's Judgment entered
on June 3, 2015.  On appeal, Gray contends that the District
Court erred in: (1) convicting him of Refusal to Submit to

Testing; and (2) considering evidence of his refusal to submit to
testing in convicting him of OVUII.2  We reverse Gray's
conviction on Count 2 for Refusal to Submit to Testing, and we
affirm the remainder of his convictions.
I.
We resolve Gray's arguments on appeal as follows.
A.
Gray contends that the District Court erred in
convicting him of Refusal to Submit to Testing.  The State
concedes error on this point based on State v. Won , 137 Hawai #i
330, 372 P.3d 1065 (2015).  We agree with this concession of
error, and we reverse Gray's conviction for Refusal to Submit to
Testing.  State v. Wilson , No. CAAP-15-0000682, 2018 WL 564771,
at *1-8 (Hawai #i App. Jan. 26, 2018).  
B.
Gray contends that the District Court erred in
considering evidence of his refusal to submit to testing in
convicting him of OVUII.  Although the District Court referred to
Gray's refusal to submit to testing in explaining its decision,
this reference appears to have been in relation to its guilty
verdict on the Refusal to Submit to Testing charge, and not in
relation to the OVUII charge.  In any event, any error in the
District Court's consideration of evidence of Gray's refusal to
submit to testing was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt as to
his OVUII conviction.  Gray admitted that he had drunk 12 to 20
beers on the night in question and was intoxicated when he was
arrested by the police; his defense to the OVUII charge was that
he was not the driver of the car.  Accordingly, there is no
reasonable possibility that the District Court's consideration of
evidence of Gray's refusal to submit to testing affected Gray's
OVUII conviction.
2Gray does not contest his convictions on Counts 4 and 5.
