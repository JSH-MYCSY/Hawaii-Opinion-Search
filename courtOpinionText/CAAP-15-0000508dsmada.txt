MOTION TO DETERMINE JURISDICTION;
(2) DISMISSING APPELLATE COURT CASE NUMBER

Upon review of (1) Defendants-Appellees State of
 
Hawai'i, Former Governor Neil Abercrombie and Governor David 
Ige's (the State Appellees) October 26, 2015 motion to determine
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
jurisdiction, (2) the lack of any response by Defendants-
Appellees County of Hawai 'i Office of the Prosecuting Attorney 
and Department of Finance Vehicle Registration and Licensing Division (the County Appellees) and Plaintiff-Appellant Mike Yellen (Appellant Yellen) to the State Appellees' October 26, 2015 motion to determine jurisdiction, and (3) the record, it appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction over Appellant Yellen's appeal from the Honorable Andrew P. Wilson's June 8, 2015 order granting the County Appellees' motion to dismiss Appellant Yellen's complaint, because the June 8, 2015 order does not qualify as an appealable final order under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2014). 
Pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a) (1993), appeals are allowed
in civil matters from all final judgments, orders, or
decrees of circuit and district courts. In district court
 
cases, a judgment includes any order from which an appeal
lies. . . . A final order means an order ending the
proceeding, leaving nothing further to be accomplished
. . .
 
. When a written judgment, order, or decree ends the
litigation by fully deciding all rights and liabilities of
all parties, leaving nothing further to be adjudicated, the
judgment, order, or decree is final and appealable.
 
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai 'i 425, 426, 984 P.2d 1251, 
1252 (1999) (citations, internal quotation marks, and footnote 
omitted; emphases added). The separate judgment document rule under Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) and 
the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 869 P.2d 1334 (1994), is 
not applicable to district court cases. Consequently, an
order that fully disposes of an action in the district court
may be final and appealable without the entry of judgment on
a separate document, as long as the appealed order ends the
litigation by fully deciding the rights and liabilities of
all parties and leaves nothing further to be adjudicated.
 
Casumpang, 91 Hawai 'i at 427, 984 P.2d at 1253 (emphases added). 
In the instant case, the June 8, 2015 order dismisses 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Appellant Yellen's complaint as to the County Appellees only. 
The June 8, 2015 order does not dismiss Appellant Yellen's complaint as to the State Appellees, and, thus, Appellant Yellen's complaint as to the State Appellees is still pending before the district court. Under analogous circumstances where the separate judgment rule did not apply, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i explained that, 
where the disposition of the case is embodied in several
orders, no one of which embraces the entire controversy but
collectively does so, it is a necessary inference from 54(b)
that the orders collectively constitute a final judgment and
entry of the last of the series of orders gives finality and
appealability to all.
 
S. Utsunomiya Enter., Inc. v. Moomuku Country Club, 75 Haw. 480,
 
494-95, 866 P.2d 951, 960 (1994) (citations, internal quotation
 marks, and ellipsis points omitted). In the instant case, the
 district court has not yet entered the last and final order in
 the series of orders that the district court intends to utilize
 to adjudicate all of the multiple claims in Appellant Yellen's
 complaint as to all of the multiple parties. When and if the
 district court enters a future order that adjudicates Appellant
 Yellen's complaint as to the State Appellees, then that future
 order will qualify as an appealable final order under HRS § 641­1(a) and the holding in Casumpang that will give finality and
 appealability to all orders in the entire series of orders
 (including the June 8, 2015 order) that the district court will
 have utilized to adjudicate all claims in this case. At the
 present time, however, the June 8, 2015 order is not an
 appealable final order under HRS § 641-1(a) and the holding in
 Casumpang. Appellant Yellen's appeal is premature, and we lack
 appellate jurisdiction under HRS § 641-1(a). Therefore,
 
-3­  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the State Appellees'
 
October 26, 2015 motion to determine jurisdiction is granted,
 
appellate court case number CAAP-15-0000508 is dismissed for lack
 of appellate jurisdiction.
 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions
 
in appellate court case number CAAP-15-0000508 are dismissed as
 moot.
