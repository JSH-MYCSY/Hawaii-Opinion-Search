STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
AMANDA BIRNBAUM, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-15-00158)
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Amanda Birnbaum (Birnbaum) appeals
 
from the "Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and
 
Plea/Judgment" (Judgment) entered on June 30, 2015 in the
 
District Court of the First Circuit1
 (district court). Birnbaum
 
was convicted of operating a vehicle under the influence of an
 
intoxicant in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E­
61(a)(1) and (a)(3) (2015 Supp.).2
 
1 The Honorable James S. Kawashima presided.
 
2 HRS § 291E-61 provides, in relevant part:
 
§291E-61 Operating a vehicle under the influence of
an intoxicant.  (a) A person commits the offense of
operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if
the person operates or assumes actual physical control of a
vehicle:
 
(1)	 While under the influence of alcohol in an
 amount sufficient to impair the person's normal
mental faculties or ability to care for the
person and guard against casualty;
 
. . . .
 
(continued...)
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On appeal, Birnbaum contends the district court erred 
by: (1) admitting evidence obtained as a result of a vehicular 
stop where Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai 'i (State) failed to 
demonstrate why the vehicle was stopped; (2) admitting evidence obtained as a result of a vehicular stop where the State failed to show that the police complied with Rule 18 of the Rules of the Chief of Police for the Honolulu Police Department and HRS § 291E-19 and HRS § 291E-20 (Repl. 2007); (3) admitting evidence of Birnbaum's "glassy and watery eyes"; (4) admitting evidence of Birnbaum's response to the question "Have you been drinking?"; (5) admitting evidence obtained as a result of a police officer's
 order to Birnbaum to exit her vehicle; (6) denying Birnbaum's
 motion for judgment of acquittal; and (7) convicting Birnbaum.
I. BACKGROUND
 
On January 14, 2015, the prosecuting attorney for the
 
State filed a charge against Birnbaum, which stated:
 
On or about December 21, 2014, in the City and County
of Honolulu, State of Hawai' i, AMANDA BIRNBAUM did
intentionally, knowingly or recklessly operate or assume
actual physical control of a vehicle upon a public way,street, road, or highway while under the influence ofalcohol in an amount sufficient to impair her normal mentalfaculties or ability to care for herself and guard againstcasualty; and/or did operate or assume actual physicalcontrol of a vehicle upon a public way, street, road, orhighway with .08 or more grams of alcohol per two hundredten liters of breath, thereby committing the offense ofOperating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant, inviolation of [HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) and/or (a)(3)]. AMANDA BIRNBAUM is subject to sentencing in accordance with [HRS§ 291E-61(b)(1)] as a first offender. 
The district court held a bench trial on May 12, 2015
 
and June 30, 2015. The State's first witness was Sergeant Noel
 
Tenney (Sergeant Tenney) of the Honolulu Police Department (HPD).
 
The State also called HPD police officers Edwin Ventura (Officer
 
Ventura) and Raynette Bento. Birnbaum objected to the admission
 
of some of the officers' testimony, including testimony regarding
 
Birnbaum's appearance of having "watery, glassy eyes" and
 testimony regarding Birnbaum's response to the question "Have you
 
2(...continued)
(3)	 With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two
hundred ten liters of breath[.]

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
been drinking?" At the close of the State's case, Birnbaum
 
presented several motions with the purpose of striking "all the
 evidence obtained in this case as a result of the illegal seizure
 of [Birnbaum's] person at the roadblock." The district court
 denied Birnbaum's motions. Birnbaum also submitted an oral
 motion for judgment of acquittal, which the district court
 denied.
 
Birnbaum was the sole witness for her own defense. At
 
the end of trial on June 30, 2015, the district court found
 Birnbaum guilty and rendered judgment for the State.
 
Birnbaum filed a notice of appeal from the Judgment on
 
July 11, 2015.
 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
A. Admission of Evidence
 
"Different standards of review must be applied to trial 
court decisions regarding the admissibility of evidence, depending on the requirements of the particular rule of evidence at issue." State v. Wakisaka, 102 Hawai
'i 504, 514, 78 P.3d 317, 
327 (2003) (brackets omitted) (quoting Kealoha v. Cty. of Hawai
'i, 74 Haw. 308, 319, 844 P.2d 670, 676 (1993)). "A trial 
court's determination of relevance pursuant to Hawai 'i Rules of 
Evidence [(HRE)] Rule 401 (1993) can produce only one correct 
result, and is therefore reviewable under the right/wrong 
standard." Wakisaka, 102 Hawai 'i at 514, 78 P.3d at 327 
(footnote omitted) (citing Kealoha, 74 Haw. at 314-15, 844 P.2d at 674. For the rules of evidence that require a "judgment call" on the part of the trial court, the traditional abuse of discretion standard applies. Wakisaka, 102 Hawai
'i at 514, 78 
P.3d at 327 (quoting Kealoha, 74 Haw. at 319-20, 844 P.2d at 676).
B. Constitutional Law on Custodial Interrogations
 
"We answer questions of constitutional law by 
exercising our own independent judgment based on the facts of the 
case[.]" State v. Viglielmo, 105 Hawai
'i 197, 203, 95 P.3d 952, 
958 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting State v. Kaua, 102 Hawai
'i 1, 7, 72 P.3d 473, 479 (2003)). "[Q]uestions 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of constitutional law are reviewed on appeal under the 
right/wrong standard." Viglielmo, 105 Hawai 'i at 203, 95 P.3d at 
958 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Kaua, 102 Hawai 'i 
at 7, 72 P.3d at 479). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
A. Police Roadblocks
 
Birnbaum contends the district court improperly
 
admitted evidence obtained as a result of an unlawful search and
 seizure for a warrantless vehicular stop.
 
"[S]topping an automobile and detaining its occupants 
constitutes a 'seizure' within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 7 of the Hawai
'i Constitution, even though the purpose of 
the stop is limited and the resulting detention quite brief." State v. Eleneki, 106 Hawai
'i 177, 180, 102 P.3d 1075, 1078 
(2004) (quoting State v. Powell, 61 Haw. 316, 320, 603 P.2d 143, 147 (1979)). "A warrantless seizure is presumed invalid 'unless and until the prosecution proves that the seizure falls within a well-recognized and narrowly defined exception to the warrant requirement." Eleneki, 106 Hawai
'i at 180, 102 P.3d at 1078 
(ellipsis omitted) (quoting State v. Prendergast, 103 Hawai 'i 
451, 454, 83 P.3d 714, 717 (2004)). 
A narrow exception to the warrant requirement allows 
police officers to stop a vehicle if the officer has a "reasonable suspicion" that the person stopped was engaged in criminal conduct. Eleneki, 106 Hawai
'i at 180, 102 P.3d at 1078 
(citing Prendergast, 103 Hawai 'i at 454, 83 P.3d at 717). "[T]he 
police officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion." Eleneki, 106 Hawai
'i 
at 180, 102 P.3d at 1078 (quoting Prendergast, 103 Hawai 'i at 
454, 83 P.3d at 717). 
A second exception to the warrant requirement is found 
at sobriety checkpoints. The Hawai 'i Supreme Court has held that 
"sobriety checkpoints established at pre-determined sites wherein all vehicles [are] stopped and the drivers examined for signs of 
4
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
intoxication for a brief period" are reasonably "justified on the
 
premise that systematic and non-discriminatory seizures minimally
 intrude on an individual's privacy." State v. Heapy, 113 Hawai
'i 
283, 300, 151 P.3d 764, 781 (2007) (plurality opinion) (citing
 Michigan Dept. of State Police v. Sitz, 496 U.S. 444, 454
 (1990)). The Hawai
'i legislature "has addressed the need to 
reduce the intrusiveness of a roadblock by prescribing under HRS
 chapter 291E, certain procedures in effecting roadblocks." 
Heapy, 113 Hawai
'i at 301, 151 P.3d at 782. 
HRS § 291E-19 allows police departments of counties in
 
Hawai'i to "establish and implement intoxicant control roadblock 
programs in accordance with the minimum standards and guidelines
 provided in section 291E-20." HRS § 291E-20 provides:
 
§291E-20 Minimum standards for roadblock procedures.
(a) Every intoxicant control roadblock program shall:
 
(1) 	 Require that all vehicles approaching roadblocks
be stopped or that certain vehicles be stopped
by selecting vehicles in a specified numerical
sequence or pattern;
 
(2) 	 Require that roadblocks be located at fixed
locations for a maximum three-hour period;
 
(3) 	 Provide for the following minimum safety
precautions at every roadblock;
 
(A)	 Proper illumination;
 (B)	 Off-road or otherwise safe and secure
 
holding areas for vehicles involved in any
roadblock stop; 
(C)	 Uniformed law enforcement officers
 
carrying proper identification;
 
(D)	 Adequate advance warning of the fact and
purpose of the roadblocks, either by sign
posts, flares, or other alternative
methods;
 
(E)	 Termination of roadblocks at the
 
discretion of the law enforcement officer
 in charge where traffic congestion would
otherwise result; and
 
(4) 	 Provide for a sufficient quantity and visibility
of uniformed officers and official vehicles to
 ensure speedy compliance with the purpose of the
roadblocks and to move traffic with a minimum of
 inconvenience.
 
(b) Nothing in this section shall prohibit the
establishment of procedures to make roadblock programs less
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
intrusive than required by the minimum standards provided in
this section.
 
(Emphasis added.)
1. Specified Numerical Sequence or Pattern
 
Birnbaum first argues that the State failed to prove
 
that the stop was made either as a "reasonable suspicion" stop or
 
as a "predetermined number" stop. The State concedes that
 Birnbaum was not stopped due to an individualized suspicion of
 criminal conduct, but that she was stopped as part of a properly
 conducted sobriety checkpoint.
 
Sergeant Tenney testified that on December 21, 2014, he
 
was assigned to set up and participate in a sobriety checkpoint. 
Sergeant Tenney also testified that he determined, based on
 traffic conditions, that the officers at the checkpoint would
 stop every fourth vehicle to speak with the driver. Sergeant
 Tenney also testified that he would flag other vehicles if he saw
 a violation, including, for example, someone without a seatbelt
 or an unrestrained child, a car without its headlights on, or a
 missing license plate.
 
Birnbaum's argument does not raise sufficient doubt
 
that the police officers failed to comply with HRS § 291E-20. 
Sergeant Tenney's testimony that every fourth vehicle was stopped
 and that he stopped Birnbaum is sufficient to imply that Sergeant
 Tenney stopped Birnbaum as a part of the predetermined sequence. 
On cross-examination of Officer Ventura, Birnbaum's counsel did
 not question Officer Ventura about how he determined whether to
 stop Birnbaum at the roadblock. Birnbaum had the opportunity at
 trial to attempt to undermine the State's position that the
 roadblock complied with statutory requirements by questioning
 Officer Ventura about his decision to stop Birnbaum, but Birnbaum
 did not do so. Birnbaum's argument on appeal that the roadblock
 failed to comply with HRS §§ 291E-19 and -20 is without merit.
2. Rule 18 of the Rules of the Chief of Police of the HPD
 
Birnbaum's second argument regarding the reasonableness
 
of the sobriety checkpoint is that the police failed to provide
 
advance warning of the roadblock in violation of Rule 18 of the
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Rules of the Chief of Police of the HPD.3 Rule 18, which was
 
adopted on September 19, 1984 states in its entirety:
 
Rule 18. ROADBLOCK PROCEDURES
 
18-1. Either all motor vehicles approaching roadblocks shall
be stopped, or certain motor vehicles shall be stopped
by selecting motor vehicles in a specified numerical
sequence or pattern based on existent traffic
conditions, including but not limited to the time of
day or night, location of the roadblock and volume of
traffic at the roadblock site.
 
18-2. Roadblocks shall be located at fixed locations for a
 
period of time not to exceed three hours.
 
18-3. The following safety precautions shall be provided at
every roadblock.
 
a)	 Proper illumination by the use of flares, or
other illuminating devices;
 
b)	 Off-road or otherwise safe and secure holding
areas for vehicles involved in any roadblock
stop;
 
c)	 Uniformed police officers carrying proper
identification;
 
d)	 Advance warning of the fact of the roadblock,
either by reflective sign, flares, or other
alternative methods. Advance warning of the
fact and purpose of the roadblocks by prior news
release;
 
e)	 Termination of roadblocks at the discretion of
 
the police officer in charge where traffic
congestion would otherwise result.
 
18-4. There shall be a minimum of three uniformed police
officers wearing reflective traffic vests and at least
two official vehicles at each roadblock site.
 
Birnbaum argues that "[c]ompliance with Rule 18's news release
 
requirement is necessary for compliance with HRS § 291E-19."
 Birnbaum argues that the State failed to demonstrate that the HPDcomplied with Rule 18-3(d) by giving adequate "advance warning"
 of the roadblock "by prior news release."
 
 
The State points out that there was adequate advance
 
warning of the fact and purpose of the roadblock. At trial, the
 State introduced a press release from the HPD dated August 27,
 2014. The press release stated that the Honolulu police officers
 
3 Birnbaum requests that this court take judicial notice of the Rules of
the Chief of Police of the HPD. Under HRE Rule 201 (1993), we may take
judicial notice of acts of an executive agency. Heapy, 113 Hawai' i at 304 
n.26, 151 P.3d at 785 n.26. Therefore, this court takes judicial notice of
Rule 18 of the Rules of the Chief of Police of the HPD.
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
had been conducting sobriety checkpoints every week from October
 
2013 to September 2014 as part of a federal sobriety checkpoint
 program.
 
The State also requested that the district court take
 
judicial notice of press release dated October 27, 2014.
4 The
 
release states that the HPD "will be setting up impaired driver
 checkpoints at unannounced times and locations from Saturday,
 November 1, 2014, through Monday, January 5, 2015."
 
Sergeant Tenney testified that he received a press
 
release, without specifying which press release, and that his
 understanding was that when the press releases are issued to
 officers, they have already been released to the news media.
 Birnbaum objected to Sergeant Tenney's testimony, and the
 district court clarified that "it is not going to be considered
 as evidence of the actual release at this point." Birnbaum later
 argued that the State had failed to present a witness at trial
 who could testify that the statements were released to the news
 media.
 While compliance with police guidelines on roadblocks 
"is germane to the reasonableness of the stop," Heapy, 113 Hawai
'i at 304, 151 P.3d at 785, the failure to comply with all 
of the guidelines on roadblocks does not in itself demonstrate that a stop at the roadblock was unreasonable under article I, section 7 of the Hawai
'i Constitution.5 
4 The State asks this court to take judicial notice of the October 27,
2014 news release, available on the HPD's website. We do not need to take
 
judicial notice of the October 27, 2014 press release because it is part of
the record on appeal.
 
5 We note that HRS § 219E-19 states, 
The police departments of the respective counties may
establish and implement intoxicant control roadblock
programs in accordance with the minimum standards and
guidelines provided in section 291E-20. The chief of police
in any county establishing an intoxicant control roadblock
program pursuant to this section shall specify the
procedures to be followed in carrying out the program in
rules adopted under chapter 91; provided that the procedures
shall be in conformity with and not more intrusive than the
standards and guidelines described in section 291E-20. In
 
the case of internal police procedures that do not fall
within the definition of 'rule' under section 91-1(4) [(2012
Repl.)], failure to comply scrupulously with such internal
police procedures shall not invalidate a roadblock that
(continued...)
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The purpose of establishing legislative and agency
 
guidelines was explained by the majority opinion in Heapy:
 
Adherence to these guidelines [contained in HRS §§ 291E-19
and -20] assures that a roadblock seizure is the result of a
plan embodying explicit, neutral limitations on the conduct
of individual officers. Conducting roadblocks in accordance
with such neutral criteria minimizes the risk that the
 individual's reasonable expectation of privacy will be
subject to the discretion of the official in the field.
Adherence to the guidelines' requirements also assures that
the surprise, fear, and inconvenience to—and therefore the
intrusion on—the—motoring public is minimized.
 
Heapy, 113 Hawai 'i at 301-02, 151 P.3d at 782-83 (emphasis and 
ellipsis omitted) (quoting State v. Fedak, 9 Haw. App. 98, 101­
02, 825 P.2d 1068, 1071 (1992)). 
Assuming, for the sake of argument, that the HPD failed 
to adequately warn the public about potential future roadblocks, this failure would have had only a minimal impact on "the risk that an individual's reasonable expectation of privacy will be subject to the discretion of the official in the field." Heapy, 
113 Hawai
'i at 301-02, 151 P.3d at 782-83. There is no evidence 
that this roadblock was set up to target Birnbaum, or that the stop was otherwise unreasonable. Birnbaum's argument that the State failed to prove compliance with Rule 18 of the Rules of the Chief of Police of the HPD is without merit. 
B. "Glassy and Watery Eyes"
 
Birnbaum next argues that the district court erred in
 
admitting Officer Ventura's testimony describing Birnbaum as
 
having "watery and glassy" eyes because "whether or not a suspect
 has 'watery eyes' and/or 'glassy eyes' does not make it more or
 less probable that the suspect: (1) consumed alcohol; (2) had
 impaired mental faculties or an impaired ability to guard against
 casualty; or (3) a prohibited breath or blood alcohol content."
 
HRE Rule 401 (1993) defines "relevant evidence" as
 
"evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact
 
5(...continued)
otherwise meets the minimum statutory criteria provided in
section 291E-20
.
 
(Emphasis added.) Birnbaum does not argue that the Rules of the Chief of
Police of the HPD is a "rule" within the meaning of HRS § 91-1, and because we
hold that Birnbaum's argument is otherwise without merit, we decline to
address the applicability of HRS § 91-1 to this case.
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that is of consequence to the determination of the action more
 
probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence."
 
Officer Ventura testified at trial that watery and/or
 
glassy eyes are symptoms that someone who has consumed an
 alcoholic beverage might exhibit. Officer Ventura's testimony
 makes it more probable that he suspected Birnbaum had consumed
 alcoholic beverages, which makes his testimony relevant under HRE
 Rule 401.
 
Birnbaum's argument at trial and on appeal that watery,
 
glassy eyes are not scientifically linked to the consumption of
 alcohol goes to the weight of the evidence rather than its
 admissibility. Birnbaum's argument is without merit.
C. Custodial Interrogation
 
Birnbaum argues that the police officer who questioned
 
her at the sobriety checkpoint failed to provide a warning as
 
provided in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), before the
 officer asked, "Have you been drinking?" Birnbaum argues that
 because she was in the holding area of the roadblock, she was in
 a "custodial interrogation situation" that necessitated a Miranda
 warning.
 
"Central to the protection afforded by article I, 
section 10 [of the Hawai
'i Constitution] is the principle that a 
police officer may not undermine a person's privilege against compelled self-incrimination by subjugating his or her will to that of [the] examining police officer." State v. Loo, 94 
Hawai
'i 207, 210, 10 P.3d 728, 731 (2000). "Absent Miranda 
warnings and a valid waiver of them, statements obtained from a person subjected to uncounseled custodial interrogation are inadmissible in a subsequent criminal proceeding brought against that person." Id. 
"To determine whether 'interrogation' is 'custodial,'
 
we look at the totality of the circumstances, focusing on 'the
 place and time of the interrogation, the length of the
 interrogation, the nature of the questions asked, the conduct of
 the police, and any other relevant circumstances." Id. (brackets
 
omitted) (quoting State v. Melemai, 64 Haw. 479, 481, 643 P.2d
 541, 544 (1982)). 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
"[A]n individual may very well be 'seized,' 
within the meaning of article I, section 7 of the Hawai 'i 
Constitution . . . and yet not be 'in custody,' such that he or 
she was not free to leave,' and yet not be 'in custody,' such that Miranda warnings are required as a precondition to any questioning." Loo, 94 Hawai
'i at 211, 10 P.3d at 732 (internal 
quotation marks and citations omitted) (disagreeing with this court's conclusion that "seizure" and "custody" are synonymous). 
Thus, generally speaking, a person lawfully subjected to a
temporary investigative detention by a police officer—who
has a reasonable suspicion that is based on specific and
articulable facts that criminal activity is afoot, is not
subjected to "custodial interrogation" when the officer
poses noncoercive questions to the detained person that are
designed to confirm or dispel the officer's reasonable
suspicion.
 
Id. (internal citations omitted). 
The Hawai 'i Supreme Court has held that an officer's 
questioning at sobriety roadblocks are not custodial 
interrogations such that Miranda rights are triggered. State v. 
Wyatt, 67 Haw. 293, 300-01, 687 P.2d 544, 549-50 (1984) (reasoning that "[t]he record . . . does not reflect that the officer may have been motivated by subterfuge or trickery in putting the question [that led to an incriminating response] to [the defendant]"). The supreme court's reasoning reflects that custodial interrogations must be marked by "intimidating or inherently coercive factors usually extant when interrogation is conducted in a custodial setting." Id. at 300, 687 P.2d at 550. 
While Birnbaum may have been "seized" while she was 
questioned at the holding area of a sobriety checkpoint, she was not "in custody" under the Hawai
'i Supreme Court's interpretation 
of article I, section 10 of the Hawai 'i Constitution. Birnbaum's 
rights under Miranda were therefore not violated, and Birnbaum's argument that evidence gathered subsequent to a custodial interrogation was improperly admitted is without merit.
D. Ordering a Driver out of a Vehicle 
Birnbaum argues that Officer Ventura improperly ordered
 
her to step out of her vehicle because Officer Ventura did not
 
have a sufficient basis to believe that a crime had been
 committed.
 
11
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"[A] police officer must have cause before ordering a
 
driver out of a vehicle after a traffic stop." State v. Kim, 68
 
Haw. 286, 290, 711 P.2d 1291, 1294 (1985) (referring to Wyatt, 67
 
Haw. at 304 n.9, 687 P.2d at 552 n.9). "[U]nder article I,
 section 7 of the Hawaii Constitution, a police officer must have
 at least a reasonable basis of specific articulable facts to
 believe a crime has been committed to order a driver out of a car
 after a traffic stop." Kim, 68 Haw. at 290, 711 P.2d at 1294. 
Officer Ventura testified that when Birnbaum was
 
stopped at the sobriety checkpoint, he asked Birnbaum if she had
 been drinking, to which Birnbaum responded yes. Officer Ventura
 then asked Birnbaum to take a field sobriety test. Officer
 Ventura testified that the reason he asked Birnbaum to take
 a field sobriety test was "[b]ecause of her condition and
 her -- and the smell of alcohol."
 
Birnbaum's admission that she had consumed alcohol, in
 
addition to Officer Ventura's testimony that he smelled alcohol
 and that Birnbaum's eyes were watery and glassy at the time of
 the traffic stop, were sufficiently specific, articulable facts
 that constituted a reasonable basis for Officer Ventura to
 suspect that Birnbaum may have consumed more alcohol than she was
 legally permitted to operate her vehicle. Birnbaum's argument
 that she was improperly ordered to exit her vehicle is without
 merit.
 
E. Motion for Judgment of Acquittal and Conviction
 
Birnbaum argues that the district court erred in 
denying Birnbaum's motion for judgment of acquittal and in 
convicting her because the "admissible evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to constitute a prima facie case for the State." Birnbaum makes no other argument than the arguments presented above, which we have deemed are without merit. Having presented no other argument on appeal, we cannot hold that the district court erred in denying Birnbaum's motion for judgment of acquittal or in convicting Birnbaum. See Hawai
'i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(7) ("Points not argued may be deemed waived.").
