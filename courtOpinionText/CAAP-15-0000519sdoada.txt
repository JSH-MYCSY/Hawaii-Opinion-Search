 Defendants' notice of appeal and Labatte's notice of cross-appeal
fail to designate the circuit court's September 3, 2015 Judgment in theirappeal. This, however, is not fatal to their arguments on appeal becauseHawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 3(c)(2) provides, "[a]n
appeal shall not be dismissed for informality of form or title of the noticeof appeal." Hawai' i appellate courts have generally interpreted HRAP Rule
3(c)(2) to mean that "a mistake in designating the judgment should not resultin loss of the appeal as long as the intention to appeal from a specificjudgment can be fairly inferred from the notice and the appellee is not misledby the mistake." Ek v. Boggs, 102 Hawai' i 289, 294, 75 P.3d 1180, 1185 (2003)
(ellipsis omitted) (quoting State v. Graybeard, 93 Hawai' i 513, 516, 6 P.3d
385, 388 (App. 2000)). Here, no party has been misled by the mistake indesignation and we can fairly infer from the notices that Defendants andLabatte seek appellate review of the circuit court's Judgment, which wouldgive this Court appellate jurisdiction over all of the circuit court'spreliminary rulings challenged in this appeal. See Weinberg v. Mauch, 78 
Hawai'i 40, 46, 890 P.2d 277, 283 (1995) ("[W]hen an order is properly
certified pursuant to [Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP)] Rule 54(b),
the certification 'necessarily renders every preliminary ruling upon which itwas predicated final and appealable as well.'" (brackets omitted) (quoting S.Utsunomiya Enters., Inc., v. Moomuku Country Club, 75 Haw. 480, 495, 866 P.2d951, 960 (1994)).

by (1) determining that Gary adversely possessed the property at
 
issue in its Count Five FOF/COL; (2) denying Defendants' right to
 a jury trial; (3) determining that Gary proved color of title;
 (4) denying the admission of some of Defendants' telephone
 directory exhibits; and (5) entering its Count Five FOF/COL when
 Gary failed to give proper notice to other interested parties.
 
Related to the circuit court's Count Five FOF/COL, Gary
 
contends "[t]he [circuit] court erred in allowing Defendant
 [Llanes] to testify that her great-grandfather Lui Louis Walawala
 Hoolapa was the son of the awardee of Land Commission Award 8149
 (Hoolapa) and in admitting the Defendants' Exhibit M-17 in
 evidence at trial to that effect."
 
Labatte contends the circuit court failed to apply the
 
applicable summary judgment standard when it granted summary
 judgment in Gary's favor as to Count Two of Gary's complaint and
 "committed reversible error when it prematurely dismissed counts
 seven and nine of [Gary's] complaint, without first affording
 [Labatte] the right to challenge the dismissal."
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve the
 various points of error as follows:
I. Adverse Possession
 
Defendants argue that "[Gary] did not prove by clear
 
and positive proof that [Gary, his father, Kazuo Ota (Kazuo), and
 
his grandfather, Isamu Ota (Isamu) (collectively, Otas)]
 
adversely possessed . . . Hoolapa's Property as a matter of law." 
Specifically, Defendants argue that Gary did not adversely
 possess "Land Commission Award 8149: 1 & 2 to Hoolapa, Royal
 Patent 3969" (LCA 8149) because Gary and Kazuo "testified under
 
oath they did not know the location of either apana
[4] 1 or 2 [of
 
4
 In Hawaiian, ' apana means "section, segment, installment, part,
land parcel, lot[.]" Mary Kawena Pukui & Samuel H. Elbert, Hawaiian
Dictionary at 28 (1986). "A kuleana, land division, may consist of several'apana[.]" Id. 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
LCA 8149.]"
 
In order to establish title to real property by
adverse possession, a claimant "'must bear the burden of
proving by clear and positive proof each element of actual,open, notorious, hostile, continuous, and exclusivepossession for the statutory period.'" Petran[ v.Allencastre, 91 Hawai' i 545, 556–57, 985 P.2d 1112, 1123–24
(1999)]. Actual, open, and notorious possession isestablished where a claimant shows "'use of the land to such an extent and in such a manner as to put the world onnotice' by means 'so notorious as to attract the attentionof every adverse claimant.'" Morinoue[ v. Roy, 86 Hawai' i 
76, 82, 947 P.2d 944, 950 (1997)]. "The element of hostilityis satisfied by showing possession for oneself under a claimof right," and "such possession must import a denial of theowner's title." Petran, 91 Hawai' i at 557, 985 P.2d at 1124.
Continuity and exclusivity of possession require that the"adverse possessor's use of a disputed area rise to thatlevel which would characterize an average owner's use ofsimilar property." Id. 
Wailuku Agribusiness Co. v. Ah Sam, 114 Hawai 'i 24, 33-34, 155 
P.3d 1125, 1134-35 (2007) (brackets, footnote, and parentheticals 
omitted). 
Whether Gary and Kazuo were aware of the legal
 
boundaries of LCA 8149 is irrelevant to Gary's adverse possession
 claim. See Hustace v. Jones, 2 Haw. App. 234, 235-36, 629 P.2d
 
1151, 1152 (1981) (holding that plaintiff adversely possessed
 land up to the fence line where he mistakenly believed the fence
 was the boundary to his property and where he satisfied other
 elements of adverse possession); see also Booth v. Beckley, 11
 Haw. 518, 523 (Haw. Rep. 1898) ("When a person enters land under
 color of title or under a mistake as to description and holds
 adversely continuously, openly and notoriously for the statutory
 period, a title by limitation may be acquired by him."). 
Gary and Kazuo testified that they each did not know
 
that they were working on Apana 1 and 2 of LCA 8149. The circuit
 court found since 1941 the Otas had made use of the land that
 constituted Apana 1 and 2 of LCA 8149 by building roads and
 walls, planting vegetables, grazing cattle, and clearing trees.
 The circuit court further found that the Otas referred to the
 land in LCA 8149 as "our land" and "[a]t no time did anyone
 approach [the Otas] to claim that [Kazuo or Gary] were not the
 owners of Apana 1 or Apana 2 or to demand that [Kazuo or Gary]
 surrender Apana 1 or Apana 2 to others."

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Defendants do not challenge any of the circuit court's 
relevant findings of fact and, therefore, they are binding on 
this court. See Okada Trucking Co. v. Bd. of Water Supply, 97 
Hawai'i 450, 459, 40 P.3d 73, 82 (2002) ("[U]nchallenged factual 
findings are deemed to be binding on appeal, which is to say no more than that an appellate court cannot, under the auspices of plain error, sua sponte revisit a finding of fact that neither party has challenged on appeal."). The circuit court concluded that the Otas' use of LCA 8149 was actual, open, exclusive, continuous, and under a claim of right for more than seventy years satisfy the elements of adverse possession. Based on its undisputed findings of fact, the circuit court's conclusion that the Otas proved adverse possession was not erroneous. See 
Wailuku Agribusiness Co., 114 Hawai
'i at 33-34, 155 P.3d at 
1134-35. 
II. Jury Trial
 
Defendants mention the circuit court's denial of their
 
request for a jury trial in their points of appeal, stating, "Did
 
the lower court erred [sic] denying appellant right to trial by
 jury[?]" Defendants, however, provide no argument to support
 their challenge and provide no citation to the record to support
 their point of appeal. Therefore, we deem Defendants' jury trial
 argument waived. See HRAP Rule 28(b)(4).

to or the manner in which the alleged error was brought to
the attention of the court or agency. . . .

III. Color of Title
 
Defendants argue that Gary failed to demonstrate that
 
the grantors named in a warranty deed executed in 1896 had an
 
interest in LCA 8149 conveying interest in the land to F.W.
 
6
Bartels (Bartels).  LCA 8149 was, according to land commission
 
records, originally awarded to Awardee Hoolapa. A review of the
 record indicates that in 1896 six named individuals,
 Kahanakumole, Pilipo, Mele, Kawai, Manamana, and Wailea Kaliai
 (collectively, 1896 Grantors) conveyed Apana 1 and 2 of LCA 8149
 
to Bartels through a warranty deed (1896 Warranty Deed). The
 
1896 Warranty Deed stated:
 
All that certain piece or parcel of land situate at
Lanihau, N. Kona, in said Island of Hawaii containing an
area of 2 acres 83/100, 2 pieces, and being the same more
particularly described in Royal Pat No. 3969, Kuleana No.
8149 awarded to Hoolapa (k) - also that certain kuleana
awarded to Kaliai Royal Pat. No. 3970, Kuleana No. 7476,
containing 1 90/100 acres[.] The above mentioned and
 
described parcels of land were inherited by us from our
father Kaliai and our uncle Hoolapa, the latter having no
issue of his own.
 
(Emphasis in original omitted.) (Emphasis added.)
 
5(...continued)
. . . .
 
Points not presented in accordance with this section

will be disregarded, except that the appellate court, at its
option, may notice a plain error not presented.
 
(Emphases added.)
 
6
 Defendants also claim that "if there was no valid conveyance of
the real property from Hoolapa, or by his son Lui Hoolapa before their deaths
by [the] 1920's, their interest in the Property passed outside of probate as a
matter of law to [Defendants]." The circuit court, however, considered the
evidence that Defendants presented to support their assertions that
Defendants' ancestors inherited or owned LCA 8149, and determined that
Defendants' assertion "lack[ed] reliability and trustworthiness because it is
at odds with the beliefs of their own elders and because the Defendants do not
 have personal knowledge of the facts that they wish to substitute for their
elders' belief and did not produce any document to support their assertion."
(Footnote omitted). "An appellate court will not pass upon issues dependent
upon credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence; this is the
province of the trial judge." Nani Koolau Co. v. K & M Const., Inc., 5 Haw.
App. 137, 140, 681 P.2d 580, 584 (1984) (quoting Shannon v. Murphy, 49 Haw.
661, 667, 426 P.2d 816, 820 (1967)). Therefore, the circuit court's
credibility determination must remain undisturbed.
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 803(b)(15) (1993)7 
provides that statements in documents affecting an interest in 
property may be introduced for the truth of the matter asserted if the statement is relevant to the purpose of the document and the circumstances do not indicate a lack of trustworthiness. See 
Maui Land & Pineapple Co. v. Infiesto, 76 Hawai
'i 402, 406-07, 
879 P.2d 507, 511-12 (1994) (holding that, pursuant to HRE Rule 803(b)(15), the circuit court did not err in considering a deed's recital that a property was "lawfully seized in fee simple" and "clear and free of all encumbrances" where there was no question as to trustworthiness of the deed); see also Apo v. Dillingham Inv. Corp., 57 Haw. 64, 67-68, 549 P.2d 740, 743 (1976) (providing that a declaration in a deed about family history or pedigree are admissible under HRE Rule 803(15) and are among the oldest exceptions to the hearsay rule). The 1896 Grantors' recital that they inherited LCA 8149 from "[their] father Kaliai and [their] uncle Hoolapa, the latter having no issue of his own" is relevant to show the 1896 Grantors' interest in the land and is, therefore, admissible hearsay. See HRE Rule 803(b)(15). 
Nothing in the record indicates, nor do the Defendants allege, that the 1896 Warranty Deed or the Grantors' recital in the deed lack trustworthiness. 
The circuit court found that Defendants' ancestors did
 
not question or challenge the 1896 Warranty Deed, nor did the
 Defendants' ancestors challenge Bartel's occupancy and status as
 
7
 HRE Rule 803(b)(15) provides:
 
Rule 803 Hearsay exceptions; availability of declarant
immaterial. The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule, even
though the declarant is available as a witness:
 
. . . .
 (b) Other exceptions.
 . . . .
 (15) 	Statements in documents affecting an interest in
property. A statement contained in a document
purporting to establish or affect an interest in
property if the matter stated was relevant to the
purpose of the document, unless the circumstances
indicate lack of trustworthiness.
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
record taxpayer of LCA 8149, even though they had constructive
 
knowledge of the 1896 Warranty Deed. In addition, the circuit
 court found that Defendants' ancestors made no reference to LCA
 8149 at all when taking inventory of family members' estates.
 Defendants do not challenge theses factual determinations in this
 appeal. Therefore, based on the circuit court's unchallenged
 findings of fact, the circuit court's determination that the 1896
 Grantors were the heirs of Awardee Hoolapa and conveyed their
 interest in LCA 8149 to Bartels was not erroneous.
 
IV. Telephone Directory Exhibits
 
Defendants contend the circuit court erred by not 
allowing them to admit copies of the Hawai
'i County telephone 
directory as exhibits during trial. Defendants do not indicate 
where in the record this alleged error occurred. See HRAP Rule 
28(b)(4)(ii). Based on our review of the record, the circuit court admitted the copies of the telephone directory to show that Kazuo and Christian Castendyk were "in the phone book for Hawaii County" without any objections from Defendants. Defendants' argument is, therefore, without merit.
V. Sufficiency of Summons
 
On appeal, Defendants appear to argue that the circuit
 
court's Count Five FOF/COL is void because Gary did not include
 
Kamahiai's name in the summons and, therefore, failed to give
 timely notice to Defendants and Tremaine's spouse, who is
 allegedly a descendent of Kamahiai.
8 Defendants argue that
 
because of the insufficient notice, Defendants could not file a
 timely response to the Complaint and Tremaine's spouse could not
 participate in the quiet title proceedings.
 
"'[T]he requirements of standing to appeal are: (1) the
 
person must first have been a party to the action; (2) the person
 seeking modification of the order or judgment must have had
 
8
 We note that Kamahiai's land interest relates to "portions of
Grant 1636 to Kamahiai," as indicated in Count Eight of Gary's Complaint, not
LCA 8149, which was the land interest at issue in the circuit court's Count
Five FOF/COL. Defendants argue that Grant 1636 is related to this point on
appeal because Gary's "complaint to quiet title and partition and surveys does
[sic] mentions Grant 1636 and testified by [Gary] during trial."
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
standing to oppose it in the trial court; and (3) such person 
must be aggrieved by the ruling,' i.e., the person must be 'one who is affected or prejudiced by the appealable order.'" Kepo
'o 
v. Watson, 87 Hawai 'i 91, 95, 952 P.2d 379, 383 (1998) (brackets 
omitted) (quoting Waikiki Malia Hotel, Inc. v. Kinkai Props., Ltd. P'ship, 75 Haw. 370, 393, 862 P.2d 1048, 1061 (1993)). After the circuit court heard arguments at its January 17, 2014 hearing on Gary's December 10, 2013 Motion for Summary Judgment (MSJ), including Tremaine's arguments that Gary's summons gave 
insufficient notice to Kamahiai's heirs, the circuit court 
granted the Defendants a continuance and permitted all interested parties to file written positions on Count Five and Count Eight of Gary's Complaint. Tremaine's husband did not file a written position with the court, nor did he file a motion to intervene, and therefore Tremaine's spouse does not have standing in this appeal to challenge the circuit court's Count Five FOF/COL. See 
Hawaii Ventures, LLC v. Otaka, Inc., 114 Hawai
'i 438, 506, 164 
P.3d 696, 764 (2007) (holding that former employees did not have standing to appeal various lower court orders where former employees were not parties to underlying foreclosure action and where they failed to intervene pursuant to HRCP Rule 24). 
Furthermore, even assuming arguendo Gary's summons was
 
insufficient and that the insufficient summons prevented
 Defendants from filing timely responses, Defendants fail to
 demonstrate how they were harmed by the alleged error given that
 the circuit court gave Defendants several opportunities to raise
 defenses against Gary's Complaint. First, the circuit court
 accepted Tremaine's and Kahakua's initial response as timely,
 without objection by Gary. Second, at the January 17, 2014 MSJ
 hearing, the circuit court granted Defendants leave to file
 written positions as to Count Five and Count Eight of Gary's
 Complaint. Defendants then filed their position statements with
 the court , as well as other oppositions to Count Five and Count
 Eight, and submitted evidence in support of their oppositions.
 Defendants had ample opportunity to oppose Gary's Complaint and
 motions for summary judgment. Any potential errors in Gary's
 
9
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
summons, as it relates to Count Five and Count Eight of Gary's 
Complaint, were therefore harmless. See Bank of Hawaii v. Shinn, 
120 Hawai 'i 1, 3, 200 P.3d 370, 372 (2008) ("[A]lthough the 
failure to provide notice . . . to a party in default is error, such error was harmless under the circumstances of this case."); see also Korean Buddhist Dae Won Sa Temple of Hawaii v. Sullivan, 87 Hawai
'i 217, 245, 953 P.2d 1315, 1343 (1998) ("A 
constitutional error is harmless so long as 'the court is able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.'" (ellipsis and brackets omitted) (quoting Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24 (1966))).VI. Hoolapa Family Chart Exhibit
 
Gary contends the circuit court erred by "allowing the
 
Defendant [Llanes] to testify that her great-grandfather Lui
 Louis Walawala Hoolapa was the son of the awardee of [LCA] 8149
 (Hoolapa) and in admitting the Defendants' Exhibit M-17 in
 evidence at trial to that effect." Exhibit M-17 was entitled
 "Hoolapa Family Chart" and contained several government documents
 that Llanes relied upon to prove her relationship to Awardee
 Hoolapa, including a birth certificate of Llanes' great-
grandfather, Lui Hoolapa, listing his father's name as "Hoolapa". 
During trial, Llanes testified that Awardee Hoolapa was her
 great-great grandfather and cited to the documents in Exhibit M­17 as the basis of her testimony. The circuit court determined
 that Llanes established a sufficient foundation for her testimony
 and received Exhibit M-17 into evidence.
 
Notwithstanding Llanes testimony and exhibit M-17, the
 
circuit court found in its Count Five FOF/COL that "(a) Awardee
 Hoolapa died without children of his own and (b) the grantors
 were the Awardee Hoolapa's nephews and nieces who by intestacy
 were his heirs as law." The circuit court ultimately determined
 that Gary "is the owner of the land covered by [LCA] 8149, Apana
 1 and Apana 2, in fee simple[.]" Thus, even if the circuit court
 erroneously admitted Llanes' testimony and Exhibit M-17, such an
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
error was harmless. See HRCP Rule 61.9
 
VII. Summary Judgment 
Labatte argues that the circuit court erred in granting
 
summary judgment in Gary's favor as to Count Two concerning "Land
 
Commission Award 7367: 1 to Kauko, Royal Patent 3971" (LCA 7367). 
Specifically, Labatte contends that Gary "FAILED to meet his
 
burden of showing how his title to the real property in this
 action was SUPERIOR to that of [Labatte]" because (1) there was
 not "any evidence that Kane and Kaluhiwa were even related to
 [Awardee] Kauko, or that they were the 'sole heirs of [Awardee]
 Kauko, either lineally or collaterally'" and (2) "[t]he paying of
 land taxes, in and of itself, is NOT sufficient to establish
 SUPERIORITY OF TITLE." (Emphases in original.).
 
In an action to quiet title, the burden is on the
plaintiff to prove title in and to the land in dispute, and,
absent such proof, it is unnecessary for the defendant to
make any showing. State v. Zimring, 58 Haw. 106, 110, 566
P.2d 725, 729 (1977) (citations omitted). The plaintiff has 

the burden to prove either that he has paper title to the
property or that he holds title by adverse possession.
Hustace v. Jones, 2 Haw. App. 234, 629 P.2d 1151 (1981); see
also Harrison v. Davis, 22 Haw. 51, 54 (1914). While it is
not necessary for the plaintiff to have perfect title to
establish a prima facie case, he must at least prove that he
has a substantial interest in the property and that his
title is superior to that of the defendants. Shilts v.
Young, 643 P.2d 686, 689 (Alaska 1981). Accord Rohner v.
Neville, 230 Or. 31, 35, 365 P.2d 614, 618 (1961), reh'g
denied, 230 Or. 31, 368 P.2d 391 (1962).

Rule 61. HARMLESS ERROR.
 
No error in either the admission or the exclusion of
 
evidence and no error or defect in any ruling or order or in
anything done or omitted by the court or by any of the
parties is ground for granting a new trial or for setting
aside a verdict or for vacating, modifying, or otherwise
disturbing a judgment or order, unless refusal to take such
action appears to the court inconsistent with substantial
justice. The court at every stage of the proceeding must
disregard any error or defect in the proceeding which does
not affect the substantial rights of the parties.

Apana 1 of LCA 7367 through a chain of title starting from
 
Awardee Kauko, which passed directly to Awardee Kauko's daughter,
 Kane, "by descent." Although Labatte argues on appeal that the
 facts were insufficient to establish that Kane was related to
 Awardee Kauko, this issue was undisputed below and in fact we
 must note that Labatte also claims ownership to Awardee Kauko's
 LCA 7367 through Kane. In fact, the circuit court cited to a
 genealogical statement that Labette filed with the court to
 establish that Kane was the daughter of Awardee Kauko. See HRE
 
Rule 803(b)(19).
10 The circuit court found:
 
5. Based on the submissions filed by the parties
herein, it is undisputed that Kauko, the original awardee of
LCA 7367, had a lineal descendant whose name appears in
publicly recorded documents as "Kane."
 
6. According to the genealogical statements filed
herein by Defendant [Labatte], this person called Kane in
publically recorded documents was the daughter of Kauko.
 
7. According to [Labatte] Kane's traditional name is
"Kana" (w) or "Kana Kalahuaihaihaipuaani."
 
(Emphases added and footnote omitted.) The circuit court
 
concluded:
 
3. All of the parties trace their respective claims to
Kane, who is their common source of title.
 
a. [Gary's] claim is based on Kane's 1898 deed
to F.W. Bartels and then through mesne conveyances
made by F.W. Bartels, his successors and assigns.
 
b. The other parties' claims are based on
descent and on the assumption that Kane's 1898
deed to F.W. Bartels is invalid and failed to convey
Kauko's land to F.W. Bartels (Apana 1 of LCA 7367,
Royal Patent 3971).
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
Labatte provides no argument as to how the circuit
 
court erred in its factual findings. The circuit court did not

Reputation among members of the person's family by
blood, adoption, or marriage, or among the person's
associates, or in the community, concerning a person's
birth, adoption, marriage, divorce, death, legitimacy,
relationship by blood, adoption, or marriage,
ancestry, or other similar fact of the person's
personal or family history.

err in finding that Kane was a lineal descendant of Awardee 
Kauko. See Querubin v. Thronas, 107 Hawai 'i 48, 56, 109 P.3d 
689, 697 (2005) ("Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." (brackets omitted) (quoting Hawaii Community Federal Credit Union v. Keka, 94 Hawai
'i 213, 221, 11 P.3d 1, 9 (2000))). 
Labatte also argues Gary failed to show that he had a
 
superior interest in LCA 7367 because "[t]he paying of land
 taxes, in and of itself, is NOT sufficient to establish
 SUPERIORITY OF TITLE." While the circuit court did mention the
 LCA 7367's property tax records in its findings of fact, the
 circuit court did not determine that Gary's title to LCA 7367 was
 based solely on the property's tax records, as Labatte contends. 
See Lai v. Kukahiko, 58 Haw. 362, 368, 569 P.2d 352, 356 (1977)
 ("Although nonpayment of taxes for a long period of time detracts
 from the strength of appellees' present claim of ownership, it
 has never been held to be a controlling factor." (citation,
 internal quotation marks, ellipses, and parentheses omitted)).
 
Instead, the circuit court concluded:
 
9. By an unbroken chain of title, the ownership of
Apana 1 of LCA 7367, Royal Patent 3971, located at Lanihau,
North Kona passed as follows:
 
a. From Kauko to Kane by descent;
 
b. From Kane to F.W. Bartels by deed;
 c. From F.W. Bartels to C. Castendyk by deed;
 d. From C. Castendyk to Mataichi Nakamura by deed;
 e. From Mataichi Nakamura to Isamu Ota by deed;
 f. From Isamu Ota to Kazuo and Yukie Ota by deed;
 g. From Kazuo and Yukie Ota, individually and as
trustees of their respective trusts, to [Gary].

 Gary's May 1, 2014 Motion for Summary Judgment (2nd
MSJ) on Count Two of his Complaint incorporated by reference the

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
arguments raised in his original MSJ and cited to the original
 
MSJ's exhibits in support of his 2nd MSJ. Gary attached as
 
exhibits to his original MSJ copies of deeds conveying LCA 736711
 
from Kane to Bartels, from Bartels to C. Castendyk, from C.
 Castendyk to Mataichi Nakamura, from Mataichi Nakamura to Isamu,
 from Isamu to Kazuo and Yukie Ota, and from Kazuo and Yukie Ota
 to Gary. The circuit court cited to these exhibits in support of
 its conclusion that Gary was the owner of Apana 1 of LCA 7367.
 
Based on the record before us, there was no genuine 
issue of material fact related to Count Two and Gary met his burden of showing that his interest in Apana 1 of LCA 7367 was superior to Labatte's. See Maui Land & Pineapple Co., 76 Hawai
'i 
at 407-08, 879 P.2d at 512-13. Therefore, Labatte's argument is without merit. 
VIII. Dismissal of Count Seven and Count Nine
 
Labatte also argues that the circuit court erred in
 
dismissing Count Seven and Count Nine of Gary's Complaint
 
because, by doing so, Labatte was "blind-sided" and precluded
 from arguing that the evidence that the court relied upon was
 fraudulent. On July 16, 2015, Gary filed a motion requesting the
 circuit court (1) certify a judgment under HRCP Rule 54(b) and
 (2) dismiss Count Seven and Count Nine of his Complaint as moot.
 On July 30, 2015, Labatte stipulated to Gary's motion and
 requested that the circuit court grant Gary's motion. Having
 failed to object to Gary's request to dismiss Count Seven and
 Count Nine, Labatte cannot now challenge the dismissal on appeal. 
We deem Labatte's argument waived. See HRAP Rule 28(b)(4); see
 
11
 The deeds purport to convey "interest in the name of Kauko, parcel
1, R.P. 3971 L.C.A. 7369, containing 1 acre situate at Lanihau, N. Kona,
Hawaii." (Emphasis added.) The circuit court determined:
 
8. These deeds, read on their face and in the context

of the record and the parties' conduct, indicate that the
respective grantor in each of the deeds in question intend
to convey and did convey to their respective grantees, by
and through their respective deeds, Apana 1 of LCA 7367,
Royal Patent 3971, located at Lanihau, North Kona. 
(Emphasis added.) Labatte does not challenge the circuit court's conclusion
that the grantors intended to convey interest in LCA 7367, nor does she
challenge the findings of fact relevant to this conclusion.
