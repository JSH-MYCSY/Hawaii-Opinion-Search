APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
In Case No. CAAP-15-0000522, Defendant-Appellant
 
Patrick K. Takemoto appeals from the Order of Resentencing, filed
 
on June 19, 2015 in Cr. No. 11-1-0459. In Case No. CAAP-15­0000523, Takemoto appeals from the Order of Resentencing, filed
 on June 19, 2015 in Cr. No. 11-1-0857. Both Orders of
 Resentencing were entered by the Circuit Court of the First
 Circuit ("Circuit Court").
1/ On August 5, 2015, the appeals were
 
consolidated. On appeal, Takemoto alleges that the Circuit Court
 erred:
2/ (1) "by ordering consecutive sentences, without notice,

2/

to a conviction occurring after the conviction in the instant
 
cases"; (2) "by 'not stating on the record at the time of
 sentencing the reasons for imposing a consecutive [instead of a]
 concurrent sentence'"; (3) when it did not ensure that Takemoto
 had the benefit of, or waived counsel, when he was convicted in
 Cr. No. 13-1-1535; and (4) "by overruling another trial court's
 order without finding a cogent reason to do so."
 
I. Background
 
In Cr. No. 11-1-0459, Takemoto was charged with
 
Terroristic Threatening in the First Degree, Criminal Property
 
Damage in the Third Degree, and Criminal Property Damage in the
 Fourth Degree, as the result of an incident where Takemoto swung
 a baseball bat at his sister and then proceeded to damage
 vehicles belonging to his sister and her boyfriend. In Cr. No.
 11-1-0857, Takemoto was charged with Terroristic Threatening in
 the First Degree, Criminal Property Damage in the Second Degree,
 Criminal Property Damage in the Third Degree, and Criminal
 Property Damage in the Fourth Degree, as the result of an
 incident where Takemoto threatened to kill a man and his family
 with a metal blade and a kitchen knife, and then proceeded to
 damage the man's vehicle with the metal blade.
 
On August 30, 2011, the Circuit Court referred Takemoto
 
to the Mental Health Court for assessment and possible admission
 in both criminal cases. The Mental Health Court denied Takemoto
 admission on January 18, 2012, because Takemoto's "speedy trial
 rights are tolled only until the next scheduled court date." On
 January 20, 2012, Takemoto entered guilty pleas in both cases.
3/4/
 
On April 13, 2012, the Circuit Court sentenced Takemoto
 
3/
 On January 18, 2012, Takemoto changed his plea to the offenses
charged in Cr. Nos. 11-1-0459 and 11-1-0857 and signed Guilty Plea forms in
each case. In Cr. No. 11-1-0857, Takemoto had a plea agreement with the State
in which he pled guilty to Counts I-III, but as to Count IV, pled guilty to a
reduced charge of Criminal Property Damage in the Fourth Degree.
 
4/
 The Honorable Richard W. Pollack presided over the change of plea
proceedings and original sentencing.

to concurrent terms of HOPE probation5/ on all counts in both
 
cases, with the sentences in each case to run concurrent with the
 
other. In addition, and among other things, the Circuit Court
 sentenced Takemoto to a nine-month term of incarceration in Cr.
 No. 11-1-0459 and ten-month term in Cr. No. 11-1-0857 with credit
 for time served in both cases. 
While on HOPE probation6/
 Takemoto's probation officer
filed motions to modify and revoke Takemoto's probation in both

 
cases. On September 28, 2012, the probation officer filed
 motions for modification of probation stating that Takemoto
 failed to submit to a urinalysis test on September 18, 2012. The
 Circuit Court later noted that no violation occurred because
 Takemoto signed in for the urinalysis test, but no record of the
 test was found, and no further action was taken on the motions. 
On May 20, 2013, Takemoto admitted to his probation

 
officer that he had used marijuana a few days earlier causing the
 probation officer to file motions for modification of probation
 in both cases on May 21, 2013. On May 22, 2013, at the hearing
 on the May 21, 2013 motions for modification of probation, the
 Circuit Court found that there was a violation of probation,
 cautioned Takemoto to comply with the terms and conditions of his
 probation, and imposed a sentence of time served. 
On October 15, 2014 Takemoto's probation officer filed
 
a motion for revocation of probation because Takemoto violated
 the terms and conditions of his probation when he was convicted
 of attempted assault in the second degree and terroristic
 threatening in the first degree on March 5, 2014.

Haw. R. App. P. 28(b)(10) ("Anything that is not part of the record shall not
be appended to the brief, except as otherwise provided in this rule."), the
State requested that this court take judicial notice of the change of plea and
judgment in Cr. No. 13-1-1535 as discussed in section III(3).

months. Within that time peirod, on February 12, 2015,
 
Takemoto's counsel orally moved to withdraw from further
 representation of Takemoto 
on the basis that the pending motion before the court,
revocation indicates a conviction of a charge that he pled to
before Judge Garibaldi. It's a 2013 case. It's indicated
 that he alleges that we did not properly advise him that he
would be looking at the consecutive or repeat possible
 sentencing in his case.
 
The Circuit Court granted counsel's oral request to withdraw. 
On June 19, 2015, the Circuit Court granted the motion
 
to revoke Takemoto's probation. At the hearing, the court
 
acknowledged defense counsel's statement that Takemoto could not
 serve a term of probation and a term of imprisonment at the same
 time. Takemoto agreed that he was in violation of his probation
 when he was convicted on March 5, 2014 before Judge Garibaldi,
 and the Circuit Court took judical notice of the records and
 files from Cr. No. 13-1-1535. The Circuit Court found that "Mr.
 Takemoto has inexcusably failed to comply with a substantial
 requirement imposed as a condition of probation and that such
 failure to comply was unreasonable." With regard to re-
sentencing, the State requested open terms in Cr. Nos. 11-1-0459
 and 11-1-0857 and restitution. Defense counsel agreed, but
 requested that everything, including the sentence from Cr. No.
 13-1-1535, run concurrent. The Circuit Court sentenced Takemoto
 to restitution and five years of incarceration for both cases, to
 run concurrently with each other, but to run consecutive to the
 sentence in Cr. No. 13-1-1535.
8/
 
Defense counsel objected, asserting that in Cr. No. 13­
1-1535, Judge Garibaldi "ordered that the term of imprisonment be
 served concurrently with any other term of imprisonment[,]" and
 
8/
 Specifically, Takemoto was resentenced as follows:
 
[I]n Criminal No. 11-1-459 [Case No. CAAP-15-522], five
years in prison in Count 1, one year in prison in Count 2,
one year in prison in Count 3. And in Criminal No. 11-1-857
 [Case No. CAAP-15-523] it's five years in prison, Count 1,
five years in prison in Count 2, and a year in prison in
Count 3. I don't believe the petty misdemeanor is still
with us. Uh, but if it is, it's 30 days in jail for that.
All of those are to be run concurrently with each other but
running consecutive to the assault in Judge Garibaldi's
case.
 
4
   
  
 
 
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
should therefore preclude the Circuit Court from making Cr. Nos.
 
11-1-0459 and 11-1-0857 run consecutively to Cr. No. 13-1-1535.
 The Circuit Court disagreed, stating,
 
I disagree. You can appeal that.  She was operating before
me. This case - I mean before I ruled on this. This was not
 part of a plea agreement that was there as far as I understand
it, and she just proceeded and gave him the five years in
prison. So she can at that point have it run concurrently
with anything that was sentenced at the time, but she can't
bind a future judge's ruling which is what she'd be able to do
with me. That isn't the way the law works.
 
Takemoto's counsel continued to argue that "[HRS §] 706-606
 
reasoning doesn't comport with this court's . . . finding that it
 should run consecutive[.]" The Circuit Court determined,
 
He was convicted. But instead of being sent to prison, he was
put on probation for these felony counts of terroristic
threatening in the first degree. . . . And then while he was
 on probation he went out and commited another violent felony.
So that's separate. He got the five years in prison.
 
So I'm looking at his behavior on probation for these
[terroristic threatening in the first degree convictions].
 And now he's convicted of a new violent felony.  The statutes
 give me the right to sentence him as I think appropriate, and
I think consecutive sentencing is needed to protect the other
members of his family and the public. 
Takemoto timely appealed the two June 19, 2015 Orders of
 
Resentencing to this court. We affirm.
 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
Sentencing
 
A sentencing judge generally has broad discretion in
imposing a sentence. The applicable standard of review for
sentencing or resentencing matters is whether the court
 committed plain and manifest abuse of discretion in its
 decision. Factors which indicate a plain and manifest abuse
of discretion are arbitrary or capricious action by the judge
and a rigid refusal to consider the defendant's contentions.
And, generally, to constitute an abuse it must appear that the
court clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded
rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial
 detriment of a party litigant.
 
State v. Mundon,  121 Hawai 'i 339, 349, 219 P.3d 1126, 1136 (2009) 
(quoting State v. Kahapea, 111 Hawai 'i 267, 278, 141 P.3d 440, 
451 (2006)).
 
III. 
Discussion
 
(1) In Takemoto's first point of error, he claims that
 
"the [Circuit C]ourt erred by ordering consecutive sentences,
 
5
  
 
 
       NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
without notice, to a conviction occurring after the conviction in 
the instant cases." Specifically, Takemoto argues that in Cr. No. 13-1-1535, Judge Garibaldi sentenced Takemoto to a term of incarceration "concurrent with any other term of imprisonment[,]" and there was no updated presentence diagnosis and report ("PSI"), and, therefore, no notice was given that Takemoto could be sentenced to consecutive terms for Cr. Nos. 11-1-0459 and 11­1-0857. Takemoto contends that State v. Sinagoga, 81 Hawai
'i 
421, 918 P.2d 228 (App. 1996), overruled on other grounds by State v. Veikoso, 102 Hawai
'i 219, 226 n.8, 74 P.3d 575, 582 n.8 
(2003), supports his position. This argument is without merit. 
Probation shall be revoked "if the defendant has
 
inexcusably failed to comply with a substantial requirement
 imposed as a condition of the order or has been convicted of a
 felony." Haw. Rev. Stat. § 706-625(3) (2014). Further, "[w]hen
 the court revokes probation, it may impose on the defendant any
 sentence that might have been imposed originally for the crime of
 which the defendant was convicted." Haw. Rev. Stat. § 706­625(5). 
Accordingly, the plain language of HRS § 706-668.5,
 
which sets forth the statutory framework for multiple sentences,
 states in relevant part:
 
(1)	 If multiple terms of imprisonment are imposed on a
defendant, whether at the same time or at different
 times, or if a term of imprisonment is imposed on a
defendant who is already subject to an unexpired term of
imprisonment, the terms may run concurrently or
 consecutively. Multiple terms of imprisonment run
 concurrently unless the court orders or the statute
 mandates that the terms run consecutively.
 
(2)	 The court, in determining whether the terms imposed are
to be ordered to run concurrently or consecutively,
shall consider the factors set forth in [HRS] section
706-606.
 
Haw. Rev. Stat § 706-668.5(1)-(2) (2014).
 
Here, Takemoto received notice that he could be subject
 
to consecutive sentencing for his convictions. In both earlier
 
criminal cases, Takemoto signed his Guilty Plea form where he
 acknowledged that,
 
6.	 I understand that the court may impose any of the
 
following penalties for the offense(s) to which I now
plead: the maximum term of imprisonment, any extended
 
6
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
term of imprisonment, and any mandatory minimum term of
imprisonment specified above; consecutive terms of
 imprisonment (if more than one charge); restitution, a
fine; a fee and/or assessment; community service;
probation with up to one year of imprisonment and other
terms and conditions.
 
(Emphasis added.) Takemoto also signed and acknowledged that he
 
understood the Terms and Conditions of Probation, which stated
 that "[u]pon any failure to comply with each of the terms and
 conditions of your probation, including special conditions, the
 court may revoke your probation and sentence you to prison or
 change or add to the conditions of your probation[,]" for both
 Cr. Nos. 11-1-0459 and 11-1-0857. Furthermore, the Circuit Court
 confirmed that Takemoto understood that his signature meant that
 he understood the contents of the plea agreement form. 
Moreover, during the June 19, 2015 revocation and 
sentencing hearing, Takemoto was represented by counsel, who agreed with the court's assessment that Takemoto was convicted in Cr. No. 13-1-1535, waived Takemoto's right to a violation of probation hearing, and did not object when the Circuit Court took judicial notice of the records and files from the conviction arising from Cr. No. 13-1-1535. Takemoto, himself, agreed that he violated his probation and gave up his right to a hearing on the violation. Accordingly, Takemoto cannot claim that he did not receive notice that he could be subject to consecutive sentences at the June 19, 2015 hearing. Cf. State v. Auld, 136 
Hawai
'i 244, 250, 257, 361 P.3d 471, 477, 484 (2015) (affirming 
this court's holding that a defendant sentenced under HRS § 706­606.5 was given reasonable notice and afforded the opportunity to
 be heard when defendant had the opportunity to oppose the State's
 motion for imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence, was
 represented by counsel at the hearing on the motion, and failed
 to object to the trial court's taking judicial notice of the
 record in both prior convictions, and therefore did not violate
 defendant's due process rights).
 
Additionally, Takemoto contends that the Circuit Court

 
erred by not requiring an updated PSI. Takemoto refers to
 Sinagoga to support his argument, but fails to offer any support
 for the proposition that an updated PSI was required for
 
7
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
resentencing. The Hawai 'i Supreme Court has explained that "[i]n 
resentencing cases, the ordering of the [PSI] is within the 
discretion of the court." State v. Fry, 61 Haw. 226, 231, 602 
P.2d 13, 17 (1979). 
Here, a PSI was prepared after the original conviction
 
in 2012. No additional PSI was prepared for resentencing on
 June 19, 2015. However, because Takemoto was on HOPE probation,
 his resentencing judge was the same judge monitoring him while he
 was serving HOPE probation and was aware of his past issues. 
Therefore, the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion by not
 ordering another PSI. 
(2) Takemoto's second argument on appeal is that the
 
Circuit Court erred by not stating its reasons for imposing a
 consecutive sentence rather than a concurrent one. Takemoto
 further asserts that while the Circuit Court gave some reasons
 for the consecutive sentences, the Circuit Court failed to
 explain "why a consecutive sentence rather than a concurrent one
 was required [since t]here was no evidence presented as to why
 other members of his family were in danger due to his behavior." 
Takemoto's argument is without merit. 
The law requires that the sentencing court consider the
 
following:
 
The court, in determining the particular sentence to be
imposed, shall consider:
 
(1)
	 The nature and circumstances of the offense and the
 
history and characteristics of the defendant;
 
(2)	 The need for the sentence imposed:
 
(a)	 To reflect the seriousness of the offense, to
 
promote respect for law, and to provide just
punishment for the offense;
 
(b)	 To afford adequate deterrence to criminal
 conduct;
 
(c)	 To protect the public from further crimes of the
defendant; and
 
(d)	 To provide the defendant with needed educational
or vocational training, medical care, or other
correctional treatment in the most effective
 manner;
 
(3)	 The kinds of sentences available; and
 
(4)	 The need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among
defendants with similar records who have been found
 
8
         NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
 
guilty of similar conduct.
 
Haw. Rev. Stat. § 706-606 (2014).
 
In State v. Hussein, 122 Hawai 'i 495, 509, 229 P.3d 
313, 327 (2010), the Hawai 'i Supreme Court held that a sentencing 
court "must state its reasons as to why a consecutive sentence
 
rather than a concurrent one was required." However,
 
[a] sentencing court is not required to articulate and explain
its conclusions with respect to every factor listed in HRS §
706-606. Rather, "it is presumed that a sentencing court will
have considered all factors before imposing concurrent or
consecutive terms of imprisonment under HRS § 706-606."  Thus,
the sentencing court is required to articulate its reasoning
only with respect to those factors it relies on in imposing
consecutive sentences.
 
State v. Kong, 131 Hawai 'i 94, 102, 315 P.3d 720, 728 (2013) 
(citations omitted). The Hawai 'i Supreme Court stated two 
purposes for requiring the sentencing court to state on the
 
record the reasons for imposing a consecutive sentence: (1)
 "identify the facts or circumstances within the range of
 statutory factors that the court considers important," and (2)
 "confirm for the defendant, the victim, the public, and the
 appellate court, that the decision to impose consecutive
 sentences was deliberate, rational, and fair." Hussein, 122
 
Hawai
'i at 509-10, 229 P.3d at 327-28. 
Here, the Circuit Court's reasoning satisfied the two
 
purposes set forth in Hussein:
 
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: . . . So the facts, you know, in
terms of the reasoning, the [HRS §] 706-606 reasoning doesn't
comport with this court's I guess finding that it should run
consecutive for the record.
 
THE COURT: Okay. Okay. Well, and my opinion on that
is based on these you're right. He was convicted.  But
 instead of being sent to prison, he was put on probation for
these felony counts of terroristic threatening in the first
degree, so that was an act of grace.  And then while he was on
 probation he went out and committed another violent felony.
So that's separate. He got the five years in prison.
 
So I'm looking at his behavior on probation for these
[terroristic threatening in the first degree convictions].
And now he's convicted of a new violent felony.  The statutes
 give me the right to sentence him as I think appropriate, and
I think consecutive sentencing is needed to protect the other
members of his family and the public.
 
First, the Circuit Court's statement that "he was put
 
on probation for these felony counts of terroristic threatening
 
in the first degree. . . . And then while he was on probation he
 
9

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
went out and committed another violent felony[,]" identified the 
specific facts or circumstances within the range of statutory factors that the Circuit Court considered. See Hussein, 122 
Hawai
'i at 509-10, 229 P.3d at 327-28; see also HRS § 706-606(1) 
(where the sentencing court shall consider "the history and characteristics of the defendant"). 
Second, the Circuit Court's statement that "looking at
 
[Takemoto's] behavior on probation for these [terroristic
 threatening in the first degree convictions] . . . now he's
 convicted of a new violent felony. The statutes give me the
 right to sentence him as I think appropriate, and I think
 consecutive sentencing is needed to protect the other members of
 his family and the public," demonstrates for Takemoto, the
 public, and this court that the decision to impose consecutive
 sentences was deliberate, rational, and fair. See id. at 509-10,
 
229 P.3d at 327-28. Hussein does not require the Circuit Court
 
to provide additional specific examples for imposing a
 consecutive sentence, nor does it mandate that evidence besides
 Takemoto's prior conviction for threatening his sister must be
 presented as to why Takemoto would be a danger to his family due
 to his behavior. Accordingly, the Circuit Court did not abuse
 its discretion when stating its reasons for consecutive
 sentencing.
 
(3) In his third point of error on appeal, Takemoto 
argues that the Circuit Court erred by not ensuring that he either was represented by counsel or waived his right to counsel in Cr. No. 13-1-1535. In support of his contention, Takemoto refers to Sinagoga, which held "if a sentencing court gives consideration to the defendant's previous convictions in choosing to impose consecutive, rather than concurrent, terms of imprisonment, the court must ensure that any prior felony, misdemeanor, and petty misdemeanor conviction relied on was a counseled one." 81 Hawai
'i at 435, 918 P.2d at 242 (citing 
United States v. Tucker, 404 U.S. 443, 447 (1972)). 
Takemoto raises this issue for the first time on
 
appeal. HRAP Rule 28(b)(4) provides, "[p]oints not presented in
 accordance with [HRAP 28(b)] will be disregarded, except that the
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
appellate court, at its option, may notice a plain error not 
presented." Moreover, "[a]s a general rule, if a party does not raise an argument at trial, that argument will be deemed to have been waived on appeal; this rule applies in both criminal and civil cases." State v. Moses, 102 Hawai
'i 449, 455-56, 77 P.3d 
940, 946-47 (2003). Accordingly, Takemoto's argument is waived. 
However, even if we review Takemoto's contention under
 
plain error, any such error was harmless. The No Contest Plea
 form and the Judgment in Cr. No. 13-1-1535 establish that
 Takemoto was represented by counsel at the time of his plea.
9/
 
Inasmuch as this is a fact "capable of accurate and ready
 determination[,]" Haw. R. Evid. 201(b), we take judicial notice
 of Takemoto's representation by counsel in Cr. No. 13-1-1535 and
 conclude that any error in failing to place that fact on the
 record in the instant case was harmless.
 
(4) Finally, Takemoto asserts that the Circuit Court
 
erred when it "overrul[ed] another trial court's order without
 finding a cogent reason to do so." Takemoto contends that "[t]he
 HOPE probation court . . . abused its discretion knowing that the
 court in Cr. No. 13-1-1535 had sentenced [Takemoto] to
 imprisonment 'concurrent with any other term of imprisonment.'" 
Takemoto's argument is without merit.
 
Takemoto received a five-year prison sentence in Cr.
 
No. 13-1-1535. That case ended with a judgment of conviction
 that included both the final adjudication and final sentence
 because Takemoto pled no contest, and was convicted and sent to
 prison by Judge Garibaldi. Accordingly, Judge Garibaldi's
 sentence was not an interlocutory order that required a
 subsequent judge to provide cogent reasons as to why it did not
 follow Judge Garibaldi's sentence. Further, Cr. Nos. 11-1-0459
 and 11-1-0857 are separate cases from Cr. No. 13-1-1535, and the
 
9/
 The State argues that,
 
[i]nformation related to [Cr. No. 1-13-1535] is not in the
record below because [Takemoto] did not dispute it and in fact
noted to the court that [Takemoto] would have to be
 resentenced to imprisonment as he could not be on probation in
the underlying cases at the same time he was serving a
sentence of imprisonment in [Cr. No. 1-13-1535]. 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
sentence in Cr. No. 13-1-1535 does not bind the subsequent
 
sentencing ability of the Circuit Court. Therefore, when Judge
 Garibaldi stated that she sentenced Takemoto to a term of
 incarceration "concurrent with any other term of imprisonment[,]"
 it did not bind the Circuit Court in any later case. Takemoto's
 probation revocation and resentencing in Cr. Nos. 11-1-0459 and
 11-1-0857 amounts to a "later case." Therefore, Takemoto's final
 point of error is without merit.
 
IV. Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the June 19, 2015
 
Orders of Resentencing entered in the Circuit Court of the First
 
Circuit in Cr. Nos. 11-1-0459 and 11-1-0857.
