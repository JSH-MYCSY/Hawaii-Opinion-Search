APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-P NO. 13-1-6166)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
In this paternity action brought by Petitioner-Appellee
 
RNM (Father), Respondent-Appellant JMKK (Mother) appeals from the
 
June 15, 2015 order awarding attorney's fees and costs, entered
 by the Family Court of the First Circuit (Family Court).

Mother argues that Father's affidavit in support of fees and
 costs was untimely and inadequate and the amount requested was
 unreasonable and excessive. We affirm.
 
I.
 
Relevant to this appeal,

 a stipulation between the
parties provided the following: Mother and Father shall have
 joint legal custody of the Child with sole physical custody to
 Mother, subject to Father's visitation; Mother shall have the
 Child on Mother's birthday, and Father shall have the Child on

 Mother's two appeals from orders denying her motions for leave to
relocate to Oklahoma with Child were resolved in SCWC-14-0001051 and CAAP-15­

Thanksgiving Day in even numbered years; and each party shall be
 
allowed to travel with the Child with at least two (2) weeks
 advance notice to the other party, and shall provide the other
 party with specific travel itinerary for such travel.
 
3
On November 21, 2014,  Father filed a "Motion for
Relief After Judgment or Order" (Father's Motion for Relief) 

seeking (1) enforcement of Father's visits with the Child on a
 regular and consistent basis as intended by the parties in
 reaching their June 5, 2014 stipulation; (2) an order that Mother
 shall not be able to travel from November 22, 2014 until the end
 of the year and that future travel shall be approved by Father;
 
(3)
 order that Father shall have his visit on Thanksgiving,
 
4
November 27, 2014;  and (4) order Mother to pay for Father's
attorney's fees and costs for having to pursue this motion. 
The
 
Family Court held a hearing on the motion on November 26, 2014.
 
On December 18, 2014, the Family Court entered its

 
order granting in part and denying in part Father's Motion for
 Relief. The Family Court ordered (1) Father would have his
 normal visit with the Child on Thanksgiving; (2) Father was
 entitled to five makeup visits with the Child; (3) Mother's
 travel was not to interfere with Father's visitation time, Mother
 could only travel during a period affecting his visitation time
 if Father agreed in writing, and Mother was not prohibited from
 traveling through the end of 2014; and (4) Father's request for
 attorney's fees was taken under advisement and Father's attorney
 was to submit a Declaration for Fees for the Court's
 consideration by December 1, 2014.
 
On December 1, 2014, Father's counsel faxed an
 
"Affidavit of Elsa F.M. McGehee Regarding Petitioner [Father's]
 Attorney's Fees and Costs" (December 1 Affidavit) to the Family
 Court. The December 1, Affidavit was delivered to court for
 filing on December 2, 2014 and listed the billable hours and

 It appears that the motion was received by the Family Court on
November 18, 2014, but was not filed until November 21, 2014.

 Father and Mother could not agree who would have the Child on
Thanksgiving, because Thanksgiving fell on the Mother's birthday in 2014.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
hourly rates worked in connection with Father's Motion for Relief
 
from November 10, 2014 to November 26, 2014.
 
On December 17, 2014, the Family Court issued a
 
"Further Order Re: [Father's Motion for Relief] and Declaration
 Filed 11/21/14, Hearing Held on 11/26/14" (Further Order)
 instructing Father's counsel to submit a declaration detailing
 and itemizing the requested attorneys fees and costs by
 December 19, 2014. On December 16, 2014, in apparent response to
 Mother's December 5, 2014 objections to Father's request for
 attorney's fees and costs, Father's counsel submitted an
 "Affidavit of Elsa F.M. McGehee in Response and Opposition to
 [Mother's] Objections to [the December 1 Affidavit] Regarding
 [Father's] Attorney's Fees and Costs Filed December 5, 2014"
 (Rebuttal Affidavit) and attached an itemized summary of Father's
 attorney's fees for the relevant period.
 
On June 15, 2015, the Family Court entered an Order 
Awarding Father's Attorney's Fees and Costs in the amount of $7,425.35, finding good cause to be shown that said fees and costs were reasonable and necessary. Mother filed her notice of appeal from this order on July 14, 2015. On August 14, 2015, the Family Court issued its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law in accordance with Hawai
'i Family Court Rules Rule 52. 
II.
 
Mother presents the following Points of Error:5
 
A.	 Father's affidavit supporting fees and costs was
 untimely and inadequate.
 
Error 4:  The Family Court erred in entering FOF 5,
which stated, "On December 1, 2014, [Father's] counsel

timely submitted an unfiled copy of the 
Affidavit of
[Father's Attorney] Regarding [Father's] Attorney's Fees and
Costs [] to the Court and [Mother's] counsel via fax

transmittal."
 
5
 Errors 2, 3, 8, and 9 are not supported by argument in Mother's
opening brief and are therefore deemed waived. Hawai' i Rules of Appellate
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(7). The remaining points of error will beaddressed along with Mother's corresponding arguments. 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Error 5: The Family Court erred in entering FOF 8,
which stated, "As a result of attempting to enforce his
court-ordered visitation, [Father] incurred a significant

amount of attorney's fees and costs."
 
Error 6: The Family Court erred in entering FOFs 9­
14, which lists the billable hours worked at various hourly
rates for [Father's] counsel and corresponding legal

assistan[ts] . . . without providing a complete, detailed,
itemized billing statement that reflect[s] those exact
amounts.
 
B. 	An award of attorney's fees must consider
 
[Mother's] financial abilities.
 
Error 7: The Family Court erred in entering FOF 15,
which stated, "In light of the fact that [Mother] could
afford to hire two (2) separate attorneys[,] her claim she

cannot afford to pay any attorney's fees and costs awarded
to [Father] is not credible.
 
C. 	The amount of attorney's fees and costs requested
 
is unreasonable and excessive.
 
Error 1: The Family Court erred in its June 15, 2015
Order, in the facts and as a matter of law, awarding
[Father] Attorney's Fees and Costs on the basis of "finding

good cause to be shown that said fees and costs are
reasonable and necessary."
 
Error 10: the Family Court erred in entering COL 8,
which stated, "The allowance or award of an attorney's fee
does not always have to be predicated on evidence presented

in its support."
 
Error 11: The Family Court erred in entering COL 9,
which stated, "In light of [Mother's] ongoing and
intentional failure to comply with the [visitation

Stipulation], the compensation requested was reasonable and
necessary in this proceeding."
 
Error 12: The Family Court erred in entering COL 10,
which stated . . . "it is fair and reasonable for [Mother]
to pay [Father's] attorney's fees and costs in the amount of 

$7,425.35."
 
III.
 
A.	 Affidavit of fees and costs was timely and
adequate.
 
Mother argues that Father's December 1 Affidavit was
 
untimely because it was not submitted by December 1, 2014, as
 
ordered by the Family Court. Mother further alleges that
 Father's counsel committed perjury when she stated that the
 December 1 Affidavit was timely submitted, because it was not
 filed until December 2, 2014.
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
At the November 26, 2014 hearing on Father's Motion for 
Relief, the Family Court instructed Father's counsel to submit a 
declaration indicating the amount of legal fees she was requesting by December 1, 2014. According to the affidavit submitted by Father's counsel, she submitted by fax an unfiled copy of the December 1 Affidavit on December 1, 2014. The Family Court was in the best position to assess whether Father's counsel's averment was true. Thus, the Family Court's FOF 5 that Father's December 1 Affidavit was timely as it was faxed to the Family Court on December 1, 2014 was supported in the record and was not clearly erroneous. Inoue v. Inoue, 118 Hawai
'i 86, 92­
93, 185 P.3d 834, 840-41 (App. 2005). Consequently, Father's counsel did not misrepresent the date of her submission, and Point of Error 4 is without merit. 
Mother also argues that Father produced insufficient
 
evidence to substantiate the amount of fees and costs he is
 seeking, because the December 1 Affidavit only provided the total
 number of hours spent by each attorney and paralegal assigned to
 the case and their hourly rates. Mother also alleges that Father
 never complied with the December 17, 2014 Further Order requiring
 him to submit a declaration detailing and itemizing the requested
 attorney's fees and costs.
 
While the Family Court did issue, on December 17, 2014, 
a Further Order requiring Father's counsel to submit a
 declaration detailing and itemizing the attorney's fees by
 December 19, 2014, Father's counsel had already complied when it
 submitted an itemized summary of Father's fees for the period
 from November 10, 2014 to November 26, 2014 attached to the
 Rebuttal Affidavit.
 
Mother further argues that the Rebuttal Affidavit does
 
not include any itemization or details of time billed for fees or
 a breakdown of costs, as a majority of the information was
 redacted. However, as indicated in her Rebuttal Affidavit,
 Father's counsel indicated that information protected by
 attorney-client privilege was redacted and billable time that was
 unrelated to Father's Motion for Relief was not included. The
 information not redacted included a detailed listing of the date,
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
detailed descriptions, hours and rate, and total amount charged
 
for each task. The itemized list provided by Father's counsel
 did provide the "detailed records demonstrating what legal work
 was performed solely with respect to the Motion to Enforce" that
 Mother requests. As this evidence supports FOF 8, that Father
 incurred a significant amount of attorney's fees and the amounts
 detailed in FOFs 9-14, these findings are not clearly erroneous
 and Points of Error 5 and 6 are without merit.
 
B. Mother's ability to pay.
 
Mother argues the Family Court should have denied
 
Father's request for fees and costs because of her limited
 financial ability to pay. Mother points to authority involving
 divorce cases to support her argument.
 
"The family court is given broad discretion to award
 
attorney's fees and costs under HRS § 584-16[(2006) 
6
].  The
 
court's award will not be disturbed on appeal if the record
 discloses adequate showing of reasonableness of the award." Jane
 
Doe VI v. Richard Roe VI, 6 Haw. App. 629, 630, 736 P.2d 448, 450
 (1987). 
Mother presented no evidence to the Family Court that
 
she was indigent, although she argued that her only source of

 
income was the $465 she received in child support from Father. 
The Family Court found her claim that she could not afford to pay
 Father's attorney's fees incredible in light of her apparent
 ability to hire two attorneys to represent her in this paternity
 case as well as an action for a restraining order.
7 We will not
 
invade the Family Court's credibility determination. "It is
 well-settled that an appellate court will not pass upon issues
 
6
 HRS § 584-16 of the Uniform Parentage Act provides, as it did at
all times relevant to these proceedings,
 
The court may order reasonable fees of counsel,
experts, and the child's guardian ad litem, and other costs
of the action and pre-trial proceedings, including genetic
tests, subject to the provisions of section 584-11(f), to be
paid by the parties in proportions and at times determined
by the court. The court may order the proportion of any
indigent party to be paid by the State, or such person as
the court shall direct.

 We note that Mother apparently lived with her family.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
dependent upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight of the 
evidence; this is the province of the trier of fact." In re Jane 
Doe, 95 Hawai 'i 183, 190, 20 P.3d 616, 623 (2001) (citation, 
internal quotation marks, ellipsis, and footnote omitted). Thus, Point of Error 7 is without merit. 
C. Attorney's fees were reasonable
 
Mother argues that the amount of attorney's fees and
 
costs Father seeks is absurd, excessive, and unreasonable on its
 face. She disputes the amount of time spent on various tasks,
 identifies tasks that she claims should not have been included in
 the attorney's hours, and disputes the inclusion of
 administrative tasks.
8
 
"Generally, in order to justify a finding of a
 
'reasonable' attorney's fee, there must be evidence, or a proper
 showing made, in support of such finding." Sharp v. Hui Wahine,
 
Inc., 49 Haw. 241, 250, 413 P.2d 242, 248 (1966) (citations
 omitted). This court has upheld an award of attorney's fees even
 where no hourly breakdown of services was provided:
 
With respect to the amount of attorney's fees assessed, the
record indicates that the court was not provided with any
details of the services rendered by counsel. An award of
 attorney's fees will not be disturbed upon appellate review
absent an abuse of discretion, and the fact that a trial
court was not provided with an hourly breakdown of services
is not grounds for reversal. Smothers v. Renander, 2. Haw.
 
App. 400, 633 P.2d 556 (1981).
 
Makani Dev. Co. v. Stahl, 4 Haw. App. 542, 548, 670 P.2d 1284,
 
1289 (1983).
 
In Makanani, this court found that fourteen hours
 
claimed by the attorneys did not appear excessive in light of the 
seven motions filed by each side and nearly two hours spent in
 court on the matter. Id. There, despite a lack of details, "the
 
court's handling of the matter clearly indicate[d] that the court
 carefully exercised its discretion." Id. Here, there was
 
detailed evidence in support of Father's attorney's fees and
 costs with an hourly breakdown of services. Father's attorneys
 
8
 The only legal authority to which Mother cites explains that
messenger fees are to be excluded. See Kikuchi v. Brown, 110 Hawai' i 204, 130
P.3d 1069 (App. 2006). This authority is inapposite as messenger fees were
not specified in the itemized list provided by Father's counsel. 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
filed two motions and spent four hours in court. In light of the
 
detailed descriptions and hourly breakdown of services provided,
 the Family Court carefully exercised its discretion when it
 approved the attorney's fees. Thus, there is evidence the
 attorney's fees award was reasonable and Points of Error 1, 10,
 11 and 12 are without merit.
 
1.	 Redacted entries were not included in fee
 
request.
 
Mother further argues that the redacted entries in the
 
itemized billing are unreasonable. She claims that forty-one
 
redacted items make it impossible to assess the reasonableness of
 the time billed, but it appears that items that were completely
 redacted were not included in Father's request for fees and those
 that were partially redacted left enough information to ascertain
 the nature of the task. Finally, we note that Mother could have
 asked for an in camera review of these redacted items, but did
 not do so. Thus, this argument is unsupported by the record and
 is without merit.
 
2.	 Mother's remaining arguments lack legal
authority.
 
Without citing to any legal authority to support her
 
arguments, Mother asserts with broad, conclusory statements that
 
(1) entries in the itemized billing for administrative work should not be awarded; (2) any award of Father's fees and costs is improper because he did not prevail on the issues raised in his Motion to Enforce; and (3) Mother acted in good faith to comply with the visitation order, so Father's request for attorney's fees should have been denied. These assertions should be disregarded because Mother fails to present any discernable argument in support as required by HRAP Rule 28(b)(7). See, 
e.g., Kaho
'ohanohano v. Dep't of Human Servs., 117 Hawai 'i 262, 
297 n.37, 178 P.3d 538, 573 n.37 (2008) ("This court will 'disregard [a] particular contention' if the appellant 'makes no discernible argument in support of that position[.]'" (citation omitted); Taomae v. Lingle, 108 Hawai
'i 245, 257, 118 P.3d 1188, 
1200 (2005) (where a contention lacks "any reasoning, supported by citations to case law or authority to constitute a discernible 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
argument," the court should decline its consideration); Citicorp 
Mortg. Inc. v. Bartolome, 94 Hawai 'i 422, 435, 16 P.3d 827, 840 
(App. 2000) (no discernible argument presented where appellants "cite[d] no apposite authority and [made] no coherent argument on the issue from cognizable precedent"). 
IV.
 
For the foregoing reasons, the June 15, 2015 Order
 
Awarding Petitioner RNM's Attorney's Fees and Costs, entered in
 the Family Court of the First Circuit, is affirmed.
