THE GAS COMPANY, LLC, Employer-Appellant/Appellee,

GRANITE STATE INSURANCE COMPANY/AIG CLAIM SERVICES adjusted by

APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
 
 
(CASE NO. AB 2014-382(WH))

(DCD No. 9-13-00641(H))
 
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Claimant-Appellee/Appellant Alexis M. DeMello, Jr.
 
(DeMello) appeals from the "Attorney's Fee Approval and Order"
 
(Fee Approval and Order) entered on July 9, 2015 by the Labor and
 
Industrial Relations Appeals Board (LIRAB).
 
On appeal, DeMello contends the LIRAB erred in (1)
 
reducing DeMello's requested attorney's fee based on an hourly
 
rate of $165; (2) characterizing some time entries as "routine
 administrative tasks"; and (3) failing to explain the reduction
 of DeMello's counsel's hours.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On July 11, 2013, DeMello, a tank truck driver for
 
Employer-Appellant/Appellee The Gas Company LLC (Employer),
 
sustained an injury to his head while he was filling a propane
 
tank. The parties settled DeMello's workers' compensation claim,
 
 

 










 




 




 


 





 
	 


 

 

 


 

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and filed a settlement agreement with the LIRAB on July 9, 2015.
 
The settlement agreement stated:
 
4. [Employer and its insurance company] shall be
responsible to pay for their attorney's fees and will
contribute fifty percent (50%) of [DeMello's] attorney's
fees for services before the LIRAB as approved by the LIRAB.
[DeMello] specifically understands and agrees that he
remains responsible to pay for his attorney's fees as
approved by the Director for his attorney's services at the
Disability Compensation Division [(DCD)], and will be
responsible to pay for fifty percent (50%) of his attorney's
fees approved by the LIRAB.
 
On April 20, 2015, DeMello's attorney Stanford H. Masui
 
 
(Masui) submitted a request for approval of attorney's fees based
 
 
on the settlement agreement, prior to the filing of the
 
 
settlement agreement.
 
 
Employer filed an objection with the LIRAB on April 21,
 
 
2015. Among its other objections to Masui's requested attorney's
 
 
fees, Employer stated,
 
 
[W]e pose an objection to the hourly rate of $210.00 for
services at the [LIRAB]. The highest hourly rate allowed by
insurance carriers for defense counsels is $175.00 per hour,
a fee that is driven by the open market. We understand
 former Director of Labor Dwight Takamine arbitrarily decided
that injured workers' attorneys should be compensated more
and decided to do this based solely on the years of service
rather than on the practitioner's skill level. This removes
 the element of protection for the injured worker that the
system is supposed to accomplish. In all cases at the
 Disability Compensation Division and in a number of cases at
the [LIRAB], it is the injured worker who bears the cost of
the attorney's fees. We submit that an hourly rate of
$160.00 is appropriate for Attorney Masui's services both at
Disability Compensation Division and [LIRAB].
 
In response to Employer's objections, Masui wrote to
 
 
the LIRAB in a letter filed on May 4, 2015:
 
 
5.	 The hourly rate for myself of $210 has been approved
by the DCD (enclosed). The [LIRAB] rate has
historically been $5 to $10 above the DCD rate. It is
 understood that this issue has been and should be
 further reviewed by the [LIRAB]. I would also
 continue to reserve my objection to the setting of
hourly rates by the DCD and [LIRAB].
 
I can assure [counsel for the Gas Company] that if
 
claimants' attorneys rates for workers' compensation were
 
dictated by the free market, and not artificially restricted
 
and depressed as it has been for decades, most claimants'
 
attorneys would charge a flat contingency fee of 20-25% plus
 
costs consistent with Longshore and Harbor Worker's and
 
Social Security policy. If hourly [rates] were freely
 
established such rates would also parallel hourly rates
 
customarily charged in the legal community, i.e., $200-300
 
per hour. I have provided the [LIRAB] with authorities in
 
the State of Hawaii to compare hourly rates allowed by the
 
courts in other fields.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Laffey matrix (enclosed), I also submitted based
 
on experience levels has been utilized by many federal
 
courts, and is the model adopted by Mr. Takamine, and not an 

arbitrary construct. In fact the use of experience levels
 
provides a more objective way of setting rates rather than
 
the previous subjective evaluations of hearing officers and
 
administrators.
 
 
In the Fee Approval and Order, the LIRAB stated:
 
2. Stanford H. Masui, Esq. ("Attorney") submitted a
 
Request for Approval of Attorney's Fee ("Request") dated
 
April 14, 2015. The total amount requested was $8,350.77
 
($210.00 per hour x 24.50 hours, $160.00 x 15.00 hours,
 
applicable taxes, plus costs of $451.15).
 
 
. . . .
 
5. In reviewing the subject fee request, the
[LIRAB] took into account the benefits obtained for Claimant
in this appeal, the novelty and difficulty of issues
involved on appeal, the amount of fees awarded in similar
appeals, and the hourly rate customarily awarded workers'
compensation attorneys possessing similar skills and
experience, including Attorney's years of practice in the
field of workers' compensation law, the number of clients
represented before the [LIRAB], as well as Attorney's
responsiveness and timeliness.
 
6. In this case, the [LIRAB] does not approve the
requested attorney hourly rate of $210.00. An hourly rate
of $165.00 for Attorney is reasonable and is consistent with
that customarily awarded to attorneys possessing similar
skills and experience before the [LIRAB].
 
7. Attorney has practiced in the field of workers'
compensation law in Hawaii for approximately 30 years.
 
8. Attorney stated that in the past three years, he
has represented approximately 100 clients before the [DCD]
and approximately 50 clients before the [LIRAB].
 
. . . .
 
10. The [LIRAB] did not approve all "Transmittal to"
entries (16 entries) as they are considered routine
administrative tasks.
 
11. The [LIRAB] has reduced Attorney's $165.00
($210.00) requested hours by 5.60 hours and Attorney's
$160.00 requested hours by 0.60 hour.
 
12. The [LIRAB's] $429.89 calculation of Attorney's
itemized costs is reasonable.
 
13.
 The total amount of $6,107.90, including fees 

and costs, is reasonable. 
 
 
DeMello filed an appeal from the LIRAB's order on July
 
 
15, 2015.

II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
Appellate review of a LIRAB decision is governed by
 
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 91-14(g) (2012 Repl.), which
 
 
provides:
 
 
§91-14 Judicial review of contested cases.
 
. . . .
 
(g) Upon review of the record the court may affirm
the decision of the agency or remand the case with
instructions for further proceedings; or it may reverse or
modify the decision and order if the substantial rights of
the petitioners may have been prejudiced because the
administrative findings, conclusions, decisions, or orders
are:
 
(1)	 In violation of constitutional or statutory
provisions; or
 
(2)	 In excess of the statutory authority or
jurisdiction of the agency; or 
(3)	 Made upon unlawful procedure; or
 
(4)	 Affected by other error of law; or 
(5)	 Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,
probative, and substantial evidence on the whole
record; or 
(6)	 Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized by
abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted
exercise of discretion.
 
See Tauese v. Dept. of Labor and Indus. Relations, 113 Hawai 'i 1, 
25, 147 P.3d 785, 809 (2006).
 
An award of reasonable attorney's fees and costs
 
 
pursuant to HRS § 386-94 (2015 Repl.) is reviewed under the abuse

 
 
of discretion standard. See McLaren v. Paradise Inn Hawaii LLC,
 
 
132 Hawai 'i 320, 331-32, 321 P.3d 671, 682-83 (2014).
III. DISCUSSION
 
HRS § 386-94 governs the award of attorney's fees and
 
 
costs in workers' compensation cases and provides:
 
 
§386-94 Attorneys, physicians, other health care
 
providers and other fees. Claims for services shall not be
 
 
valid unless approved by the director or, if an appeal is 

had, by the appellate board or court deciding the appeal. 

Any claim so approved shall be a lien upon the compensation 

in the manner and to the extent fixed by the director, the 

appellate board, or the court. 
 
 
In approving fee requests, the director, appeals
 
board, or court may consider factors such as the attorney's
 
skill and experience in state workers' compensation matters,
 
the amount of time and effort required by the complexity of
 
the case, the novelty and difficulty of the issues involved,

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the amount of fees awarded in similar cases, benefits
obtained for the claimant, and the hourly rate customarily
awarded attorneys possessing similar skills and experience.
In all cases, reasonable attorney's fees shall be awarded.
 
Any person who receives any fee, other consideration,
or gratuity on account of services so rendered, without
approval, in conformity with the preceding paragraph, shall
be fined by the director not more than $10,000.
 
The LIRAB is required to set forth its reasons for reducing an 
award for attorney's fees and costs. McLaren, 132 Hawai 'i at 
330-31, 321 P.3d at 681-82 (applying the rationale in In re Bettencourt, 126 Hawai
'i 26, 265 P.3d 1122 (2011) to workers' 
compensation cases).1 
DeMello argues that the LIRAB is not allowed to set 
hourly rates, and must only consider the hourly rate customarily awarded attorneys possessing similar skills and experience. Nothing in HRS § 386-94 precludes the LIRAB from employing the "lodestar method" of calculating reasonable attorney's fees, under which reasonable attorney's fees are calculated by the number of hours reasonably expended by a reasonable hourly rate. See Kaleikini v. Yoshioka, 129 Hawai
'i 454, 469, 304 P.3d 252, 
267 (2013). 
The LIRAB's statement that $210 was an unreasonable 
rate while $165 was a reasonable rate does not seem to be based on any evidence before the LIRAB, and was certainly not explained in sufficient detail in its award of attorney's fees. See 
McLaren, 132 Hawai
'i at 330-31, 321 P.3d at 681-82. The LIRAB's 
recitation of factors enumerated in HRS § 386-94 is not an explanation for its decision to reduce Masui's requested attorney's fees. The LIRAB is required to apply those factors based on evidence submitted so that a reviewing body may adequately assess whether the LIRAB abused its discretion. See 
McLaren, 132 Hawai
'i at 331, 321 P.3d at 682. 
1 Although the Hawai' i Supreme Court in  McLaren focused on the need for 
the Director to provide an explanation for a reduction in costs so that the
LIRAB may review the Director's decision, the reasoning in 
McLaren is
applicable to a situation in which the LIRAB is the body awarding and reducingan attorney's fees request such that it is reviewable by this court. See 
McLaren, 132 Hawai' i at 332, 321 P.3d at 683 ("[T]o enable appropriate review
of any reductions in [requests for attorney's fees and costs], the [Director]must appropriately set forth its reasons for the reductions.").

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The LIRAB also failed to provide an explanation for its 
decision to deny certain tasks as "routine administrative tasks," and again, we cannot determine whether the LIRAB abused its discretion. See McLaren, 132 Hawai
'i at 330-31, 321 P.3d at 681­
82. Therefore, we remand to the LIRAB for further proceedings
 
related to the appropriateness of Masui's requested attorney's
 fees and costs. 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
The "Attorney's Fee Approval and Order" entered on July
 
9, 2015 by the Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board is
 vacated and this case is remanded for proceedings consistent with
 this opinion.
