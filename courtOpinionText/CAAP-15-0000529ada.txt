Court's (1) Order Granting Defendant Jonah Scott Kogen's Motion

Owners of Hawaiian Monarch's Motion to Dismiss Complaint, filed
 
June 16, 2015 (Order Dismissing the AOAO).
 
This case presents difficult and consequential 
questions concerning whether an association of apartment owners must have a power of sale over its units in order to foreclose on a lien against a unit through the nonjudicial power of sale foreclosure procedures set forth in the Hawai' i Foreclosures 
statute. After an exhaustive review, we have concluded that over a number of years the Legislature has worked to craft workable, nonjudicial foreclosure procedures, available to associations as well as lenders, but at no point did the Legislature take up the issue of whether to enact a blanket grant of powers of sale over all condominiumized properties in Hawai' i.  Accordingly, we 
conclude that a power of sale in favor of a foreclosing association must otherwise exist, in the association's bylaws or another enforceable agreement with its unit owners, in order for the association to avail itself of the nonjudicial power of sale foreclosure procedures set forth in Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 
chapter 667. As discussed herein, under the circumstances of 
this case, we conclude that Sakal may not regain title and possession of the subject property, but that the Circuit Court erred in dismissing Sakal's claims against the AOAO for wrongful foreclosure. I. BACKGROUND
 
On May 5, 2014, Sakal filed a three-count Complaint
 
seeking relief against the AOAO for wrongful foreclosure, and
 against all named defendants for quiet title and trespass. The
 Complaint includes, inter alia, the following factual
 allegations:
 
It is alleged that, on January 17, 1979, the developer
 
of the Hawaiian Monarch Condominium Project adopted the Bylaws of
 the Association of Apartment Owners of Hawaiian Monarch (Bylaws)
 
2
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and that the Bylaws provided, "the Developer hereby declares that
 
all of the property (of the Hawaiian Monarch) is held and shall
 be held, conveyed, mortgaged, encumbered, leased, rented, used,
 occupied and improved subject to the following Bylaws . . . [.]" 
Article VI of the Bylaws, entitled "Common Expenses, Apartment
 Expenses, Taxes and Accounting," Section 4, entitled "Default in
 Payment of Assessments," allegedly states: 
In the event of a default or defaults in payment of
any such assessment or assessments and in addition to any
other remedies the Board of Directors may have, the Board of
Directors may enforce each such obligation as follows:
(a) By suit or suits to enforce such obligations. . .
(b) . . . [T]he Board may file a claim of lien against
the Apartment of such delinquent Owner. . . . Upon
recordation of a duly executed original or copy of such
claim of lien with the Office of the Assistant Registrar of
the Land Court of the State of Hawaii, the Board shall have
all remedies provided in Section 514A-90, HRS. 
The Bylaws were reportedly amended in the 1990s, but
 
the amendments, Sakal alleged, did not grant the AOAO "any
 
additional power regarding the foreclosure of an association
 lien." 
On March 31, 2006, Sakal was assigned a leasehold 
interest in 444 Niu Street, Unit 2806-A, in the Hawaiian Monarch Condominium Project (Property), as a tenant in severalty in an 
"Assignment of Condominium Conveyance Document" (Assignment of
Conveyance) registered with the Office of the Assistant 
Registrar, Land Court of the State of Hawai' i (Land Court).
2 
On March 16, 2012, the AOAO filed a "Notice of Lien"
 
(Lien Notice) against Sakal in the Land Court, claiming a lien
 for unpaid assessments in the amounts of $11,417.91 and
 
$10,589.42, and on June 20, 2012, the AOAO filed a "Notice of
 Default and Intention to Foreclose" (Default Notice) against
 
Sakal in the Land Court, which stated:
 
(i)f the default is not cured by the deadline stated in this
notice, the entire unpaid balance of moneys owed to the
association will be due and the association intends to
 conduct a power of sale foreclosure to sell the property at
a public sale without any court action and without going to

court, and the association or any other person may acquire
the property at the public sale.
 
It appears that on October 11, 2012, the AOAO filed an
 
"Amended Notice of Default and Intention to Foreclose" with the
 
Land Court, and on October 15, 2012, the AOAO filed a "Notice of
 Association's Non-Judicial Foreclosure Under Power of Sale"
 (Power of Sale Notice) with the Land Court, stating that a public
 
auction would be held on December 3, 2012, at the State Capitol
 
Building "pursuant to Sections 514B-146 and 667-21 through 667­42, HRS, as amended." 
Sakal asserts that, on November 30, 2012, he filed a
 
Motion for Preliminary Injunction Staying Non-Judicial
 Foreclosure Sale of Property with the Circuit Court in Civil No.
 12-1-0686, which was denied on December 3, 2012.
3 Also on
 
December 3, 2012, the AOAO reportedly held a public auction
 offering the Property for sale. On January 8, 2013, the AOAO
 filed a "Grantor's Affidavit of Non-judicial Foreclosure Under
 Power of Sale" with the Land Court (Affidavit).
4 On January 16,
 
2013, a quitclaim deed (Quitclaim Deed), which conveyed the
 
Property from the AOAO to Kogen for $50,500, was recorded in the
 
Land Court. 
It appears that, on April 2, 2013, Kogen filed an
 
ejectment action against Sakal in the District Court of the First
 Circuit (District Court) in Case No. 1RC-13-1-02405. The
 
District Court entered a Judgment for Possession and Writ of
 
Possession in favor of Kogen on May 5, 2013.
5
 
3 It does not appear that Sakal appealed or otherwise sought relief
from the denial of his motion for an injunction.
 
4
 The Bylaws, Default Notice, Power of Sale Notice, Amended Notice
of Default and Intention to Foreclose, and Affidavit are not in the record on
appeal. For the purposes of this appeal, however, it does not appear that
Appellees dispute the material facts alleged in the Complaint. 
5
 Although it appears from the District Court's minutes that Kogen's
claim for money damages against Sakal was to be dismissed, it does not appear
that a final written order or judgment was entered. However, it also appears
that Sakal did not file an affidavit, pursuant to the District Court Rules of
Civil Procedure Rule 12.1, seeking to interpose a defense to the jurisdiction
of the District Court to the effect that title to real estate was involved,

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Sakal filed the Complaint herein on May 5, 2014. The 
AOAO filed an answer on June 12, 2014. Kogen did not file an 
answer and instead, on August 11, 2014, filed a motion to dismiss the claims against him in Counts 2 and 3 of the Complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP). 
Citing Aames Funding Corp. v. Mores, 107 Hawai' i 95, 
110 P.3d 1042 (2005), Kogen primarily argued that Sakal's claim for relief from the nonjudicial foreclosure was untimely because Sakal was required to challenge the validity of the foreclosure proceedings prior to the date of the recordation of the Quitclaim Deed. In opposition, Sakal argued that: (1) HRS chapter 501, which was at issue in Aames, does not apply to the property interest in this case; (2) unlike in Aames, no new Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) was issued to Kogen; (3) the 
nonjudicial foreclosure conducted by the AOAO pursuant to HRS 
chapter 667 was illegal because the AOAO did not hold a power of sale; (4) implying a power of sale would be an unreasonable impairment of contract, and thus contrary to HRS § 514B-22; and (5) a nonjudicial foreclosure is void and unenforceable where the
 foreclosing entity does not have a power of sale. In reply,
 Kogen argued, inter alia, that the AOAO had the authority to
 "foreclose by power of sale" and that the Bylaws granted the AOAO
 the remedy of nonjudicial foreclosure because they authorize the
 Board of Directors to use "any other remedies it may have" to
 enforce assessments. At the hearing on Kogen's motion, the
 Circuit Court orally granted the motion, stating: "The Court
 finds that HRS [§ 514B-146] provides the association with broad
 powers, including foreclosure and [it] doesn't make any sense for
 the association to have to amend its bylaws every time the
 Legislature amends the law. Also HRS 667-102(b) claims by the

and Writ of Possession.

unit owners are barred if not made before the affidavit and
 
conveyance documents are filed." (Format altered). The Order
 Dismissing Kogen was entered on October 21, 2014.
 
On March 10, 2015, the AOAO filed its motion to dismiss
 
the Complaint in its entirety, pursuant to HRCP Rule 12(b)(6). 
The AOAO's motion was supported by a declaration of counsel, the
 Quitclaim Deed, and a transcript of the hearing on Kogen's motion
 to dismiss. The AOAO's arguments mirrored those in Kogen's
 motion to dismiss. On March 23, 2015, Sakal filed a memorandum
 in opposition, which was supported by a declaration of counsel,
 the Assignment of Conveyance, and the Lien Notice. After a
 hearing on March 31, 2015, the Circuit Court entered the Order
 Dismissing the AOAO on June 16, 2015. 
On July 16, 2015, Sakal filed a notice of appeal in
 
CAAP-15-0000529. On August 5, 2015, the Circuit Court entered
 the Judgment. On August 11, 2015, Sakal filed a second notice of
 
appeal in CAAP-15-0000573. The appeals were consolidated into
 
CAAP-15-0000529 on August 17, 2015.
 II. POINT OF ERROR
 
Sakal raises a single point of error, contending that
 
the Circuit Court erred when it dismissed his Complaint for
 failure to state a claim because the AOAO conducted a wrongful
 power of sale nonjudicial foreclosure without having a valid
 power of sale.
 III. APPLICABLE STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
This court reviews a trial court's ruling on a motion
 
to dismiss de novo. Isobe v. Sakatani, 127 Hawai' i 368, 375, 279 
P.3d 33, 40 (App. 2012) (citing Kamaka v. Goodsill Anderson Quinn
 & Stifel, 117 Hawai' i 92, 104, 176 P.3d 91, 103 (2008)). 
A complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a
claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can
prove no set of facts in support of his or her claim that
would entitle him or her to relief. This court must,
therefore, view a plaintiff's complaint in a light most
favorable to him or her in order to determine whether the
 allegations contained therein could warrant relief under any
alternate theory. Consequently, in reviewing the circuit
court's order dismissing the plaintiffs' complaint in this
 
6
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
case, our consideration is strictly limited to the
allegations of the complaint, and we must deem those
allegations to be true.
 
Id. at 376, 279 P.3d at 41 (citations and quotation marks
 
omitted).
 IV. DISCUSSION
 A. Nonjudicial Power of Sale Foreclosure
 This wrongful foreclosure action is based on the
 
premise that a foreclosing association of apartment owners, like
 a mortgagee, must have a power of sale for the unit owner's unit
 in order to foreclose on a lien against the unit by the
 nonjudicial power of sale foreclosure procedures set forth in HRS
 chapter 667.
6 Sakal alleges that the AOAO has not been granted a
 
power of sale, either by contract or by statute, and therefore,
 the nonjudicial foreclosure of his unit was unlawful, the sale of
 his unit to Kogen was invalid, and he is entitled to have the
 sale of the unit declared void, as well as being entitled to
 other remedies. Appellees do not argue that a power of sale has
 been directly conferred on the AOAO in the Bylaws. Instead, they
 argue, variously, that the Bylaws provide the AOAO with broad
 authority to enforce a lien against the unit/apartment of a
 delinquent owner, and that the available remedies include
 nonjudicial power of sale foreclosure pursuant to HRS § 514A-90,
 HRS § 514B-146(a), or both.
 
1. Hawai'i foreclosure law 
We first consider the Hawai' i Foreclosures statute, HRS 
chapter 667 (2016), as Sakal's claim is essentially that the AOAO's foreclosure on the Property was not authorized under Hawai'i law. HRS chapter 667 is entitled "Foreclosures" and 
6
 HRS § 667-1 (2016) defines "Association" by reference to the
definition in HRS §§ 421J-2 & 514B-3. HRS § 514B-3 (2006), which is part of
the Condominium Property Act, states that "'Association' means the unit
owners' association organized under section 514B-102 or under prior
condominium property regime statutes." It is undisputed that the AOAO is an
"association" within the meaning of HRS chapters 514B and 667. Sakal was a
 "unit owner," and the Property is a "unit," within the meaning of the
applicable statutes. See HRS §§ 667-1 & 514B-3.
 
7
   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
governs both judicial and nonjudicial foreclosures in Hawai' i. 
This statute has undergone significant reorganization and 
amendment over the years, most notably in 2012. Because the AOAO's nonjudicial power of sale foreclosure on Sakal's unit was conducted in the latter part of 2012, unless otherwise noted, we refer to HRS chapter 667 as it was amended by Act 182 of 2012, which took effect on June 28, 2012.
7 
Part I of HRS chapter 667 now states "General
 
Provisions" and includes HRS § 667-1, entitled "Definitions,"
 which provides definitions that are applicable to the entire
 chapter. Part IA of HRS chapter 667 now governs "Foreclosure by
 Action," which is judicial foreclosure. Part II of HRS chapter
 667 provides a "Power of Sale Foreclosure Process," which
 delineates the procedures that must be followed in order to
 effectuate a nonjudicial power of sale foreclosure, which is a
 foreclosure that is not conducted under court supervision and
 pursuant to court orders. Part VI of HRS chapter 667 now
 provides an "Association Alternate Power of Sale Foreclosure
 Process," which closely parallels the Power of Sale Foreclosure
 Process in Part II; however, Part VI is drafted to specifically
 reflect that the foreclosing party is an association, rather than
 a mortgagee.
 
Prior to Act 182 of 2012, Part I of HRS chapter 667
 
addressed both "Foreclosure by Action" and "Foreclosure by Power
 of Sale." Within the "old" Part I, HRS § 667-5 (repealed in
 2012) provided a procedure through which a mortgagee could 
foreclose upon a property, without filing suit, in conjunction
 with the exercise of a power of sale provision contained in a
 mortgage. Prior to 2012, Part II provided an "Alternate Power of
 Sale Foreclosure Process," as an elective alternative to the
 Foreclosure Under Power of Sale provision that existed in HRS
 
7
 See 2012 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 182, § 69 at 689. Section 69 of Act
 
182 also contains certain exceptions regarding the effective date that are not
relevant here. 
8
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
§ 667-5 (repealed in 2012). Both of these nonjudicial
 
foreclosure processes were founded upon the existence of a power
 of sale provision. HRS § 667-40 (2016), which is contained in
 Part II of HRS chapter 667, specifically provided, and still
 provides, that a power of sale foreclosure pursuant to Part II
 can be conducted in certain non-mortgage situations where a law
 or written document "contains, authorizes, permits, or provides
 for a power of sale, a power of sale foreclosure, a power of sale
 remedy, or a nonjudicial foreclosure."
8 Part VI of HRS chapter
 
667, which provides an alternative power of sale foreclosure
 procedure specifically tailored to associations, did not exist
 prior to 2012.
 
HRS chapter 667 defines "nonjudicial foreclosure" and
 
"power of sale" or "power of sale foreclosure" as follows:
 
"Nonjudicial foreclosure" means foreclosure under
 
power of sale .
 
. . . .
 
"Power of sale" or "power of sale foreclosure" means a
nonjudicial foreclosure when the mortgage contains,
authorizes, permits, or provides for a power of sale, a
power of sale foreclosure, a power of sale remedy, or a
nonjudicial foreclosure .
 
HRS § 667-1 (emphasis added).
 
Notably, HRS § 667-1 specifically defines nonjudicial
 
foreclosure with reference to a power of sale. The Hawai' i 
Supreme Court has described a power over property as follows:
 
A power over property is defined as liberty or authority
reserved by, or limited to, a person to dispose of real or
personal property for his own benefit, or for the benefit of
others, and operating on an estate or interest, vested
either in himself or in some other person; the liberty or
authority, however, not being derived out of such estate or
interest, but overreaching or superseding it, either wholly
 
8
 Part II of HRS chapter 667 was enacted through Act 122 of 1998, in
order to address certain shortcomings in HRS § 667-5 (repealed in 2012). HRS
 § 667-40, which is applicable only to time share plans, condominium property
regimes, and agreements of sale, remains in effect as enacted in 1998 (with
subsequent amendments), notwithstanding the addition of Part VI, as well as
Part IV, which pertains to the foreclosure of a time share interest where a
time share interest mortgage, loan, agreement, or contract contains a power of
sale.
 
9
  
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
or partially. Such a power has also been defined as an
authority enabling one person to dispose of the interest
which is vested in another.
 
Victoria Ward, Ltd. v. Zion Securities Corp., 36 Haw. 614, 630
 
(1944) (citation and quotation marks omitted).
 
As noted above, the definition of a nonjudicial
 
foreclosure as a power of sale foreclosure is applicable to the
 entirety of HRS chapter 667, including Parts II and VI. Thus,
 any nonjudicial foreclosure under Part II is by definition a
 foreclosure under a power of sale, and an association's
 nonjudicial foreclosure under Part VI also is a foreclosure under
 a power of sale.
 
Prior to 2012, from the time that Part II was added to 
HRS chapter 667,
9 the definitions for "power of sale" or "power 
of sale foreclosure" were stated in HRS § 667-21 (Supp. 2011), which was the first provision in Part II of HRS chapter 667, rather than in HRS § 667-1. In 2011, as part of the first legislative step in a comprehensive review and reform of foreclosures in Hawai' i, the definition of "nonjudicial 
foreclosure" was added to HRS § 667-21, presumably to clarify or confirm that a nonjudicial foreclosure was in fact a foreclosure under a power of sale. 2011 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 48, § 20 at 106­07. All of the HRS chapter 667 definitions, including those
 
previously found in HRS § 667-21, were moved to HRS § 667-1 in
 2012. 2012 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 182, § 3 at 636. 
The Hawai' i Foreclosures statute sets forth the 
procedures for foreclosure in Hawai' i and does not create a right 
to foreclose, either through a judicial process or a nonjudicial process. For example, Part II of HRS chapter 667, entitled "Power of Sale Foreclosure Process," states that "[t]he power of sale process in this part is an alternative to the foreclosure by action in part IA." HRS § 667-21 (2016) (emphasis added). Similarly, Part VI of HRS chapter 667, entitled "Association 
9
 See 1998 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 122, § 1 at 468.
 
10
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Alternate Power of Sale Foreclosure Process," states that "[t]he
 
power of sale process in this part is an alternative to the
 foreclosure by action in part IA and the foreclosure by power of
 sale in part II." HRS § 667-91 (2016) (emphasis added). 
In reviewing a nonjudicial foreclosure conducted 
pursuant to HRS § 667-5 (repealed in 2012), the Hawai' i Supreme 
Court recognized that no Hawai' i statute, including HRS chapter 
667, provides mortgagees the right to proceed by nonjudicial foreclosure; rather, HRS § 667-5 only allows for the creation of a power of sale, if the parties choose to do so, within the four corners of a contract. Santiago v. Tanaka, 137 Hawai' i 137, 155, 
366 P.3d 612, 630 (2016), citing Lee v. HSBC Bank USA, 121 Hawai'i 287, 289, 218 P.3d 775, 777 (2009); see also Apao v. Bank 
of N.Y., 324 F.3d 1091, 1095 (9th Cir. 2003) (finding that HRS § 667–5 "did not confer the power of sale, but merely authorized the parties to contract for the express terms of foreclosure upon default"). Although Santiago, Lee v. HSBC, and Apao specifically addressed HRS § 667-5 (repealed in 2012), the principles stated therein are equally applicable to nonjudicial power of sale foreclosures conducted under Part II or Part VI of HRS chapter 667. No provision of Part II or Part VI, or any other part of
 
the Foreclosures statute, establishes powers of sale for
 mortgagees, or associations, or provides for any form of
 nonjudicial foreclosures in the absence of such powers. A search
 of the legislative history, as well as the text, of HRS chapter
 667 from the time that Part II was enacted in 1998 and through
 the time that Part VI was enacted in 2012 reveals no legislative
 purpose or intent to grant any class of persons or entities with
 a power of sale over the property of others through the amendment
 of HRS chapter 667. Thus, we conclude that the supreme court's
 observation that HRS § 667-5 (repealed in 2012) does not provide
 the right to proceed by nonjudicial foreclosure is applicable to
 Parts II and VI of HRS chapter 667, as well as to HRS § 667-5
 (repealed).
 
11
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Indeed, as noted above, HRS § 667-40 specifically
 
allows an association to conduct a nonjudicial power of sale
 
foreclosure under Part II only where a law or written document
 "contains, authorizes, permits, or provides for a power of sale,
 a power of sale foreclosure, a power of sale remedy, or a
 nonjudicial foreclosure." This language is identical to the HRS
 § 667-1 definition of a power of sale or power of sale
 foreclosure, except that HRS § 667-1 refers to a "mortgage"
 rather than a "law or written document." Part VI of HRS chapter
 667 contains neither a grant of a power of sale nor an express
 limitation like the one set forth in Part II, in HRS § 667-40. 
However, other requirements stated in Part VI of HRS chapter 667
 make clear that the association's power must come from some other
 provision of law or the association's own controlling documents. 
For example, HRS § 667-101(a)(1) mandates that "[a]fter the
 public sale is held, the association shall sign an affidavit
 under penalty of perjury [s]tating that the power of sale
 foreclosure was made pursuant to the power of sale provision in
 the law or association documents[.]" (Emphasis added; format
 altered).
10
 
As stated above, a power of sale is an authority
 
reserved by or granted to a person or entity to dispose of
 another person's vested property interest, for the first party's
 own benefit or the benefit of a third party. See Victoria Ward,
 
36 Haw. at 630. We will not infer that such significant powers
 have been granted over an entire class of property in the absence
 of a clear legislative act or, with respect to a particular
 association or property, by express authorization in a contract
 entered into by, or otherwise binding on, the affected parties. 
HRS chapter 667 provides for various alternative processes or
 procedures through which a lienholder might foreclose on a
 
10
 There is no reference anywhere in Part VI or elsewhere in HRS
chapter 667 to a particular provision of law that in fact grants a power of
sale to all associations or any subset of associations. 
12
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
property, but it does not grant a lienholder association with a
 
power of sale over a unit owner's property. Rather, such power
 of sale must otherwise exist in order for the association to
 lawfully avail itself of the nonjudicial foreclosure alternative. 
Thus, we turn to the condominium statutes cited by
 
Appellees. 
2. Hawai'i condominium property regime statutes 
HRS chapter 514A applies to all "[c]ondominiums created
 
prior to July 1, 2006, except as provided in . . . sections 514B­22 and 514B-23," and other exceptions not applicable here. HRS
 § 514A-1.5(a)(2)(A) (Supp. 2017).
11 HRS Chapter 514B applies to
 
"all condominiums created within this State after July 1, 2006." 
HRS § 514B-21 (2006). HRS § 514B-22 provides that certain
 enumerated provisions in HRS chapter 514B, including HRS §
 514B-146, apply to all condominiums created before July 1, 2006,
 but "only with respect to events and circumstances occurring on
 or after July 1, 2006," provided that their application does not
 "invalidate existing provisions of the declaration, bylaws . . .
 or be an unreasonable impairment of contract." HRS § 514B-22
 (2006).
12
 
As the Complaint alleges that the subject condominium
 
project was developed prior to July 1, 2006, we first consider
 the relevant provisions of HRS chapter 514A. The Bylaws
 allegedly were signed and became effective in 1979. At that
 time, and until 1999, HRS § 514A-90 (1993) provided, in relevant
 part, that "[t]he lien of the association of apartment owners may
 be foreclosed by action by the manager or board of directors,
 
11
 HRS chapter 514A was repealed by 2017 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 181 § 2,
effective January 1, 2019. 
12
 HRS § 514B-22 was repealed by 2017 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 181 § 4,

repealed and HRS chapter 514B will apply to all condominiums in Hawai 'i 
regardless of their creation date, "provided that such application shall notinvalidate existing provisions of the declaration, bylaws, condominium map, orother constituent documents of those condominiums if to do so would invalidate the reserved rights of a developer." HRS § 514B-21 (Supp. 2017).

acting on behalf of the apartment owners, in like manner as a 
mortgage of real property." (Emphasis added.) In 1999, this part of HRS § 514A-90 was clarified regarding associations' authority to use nonjudicial or power of sale foreclosure proceedings to enforce liens. See 1999 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 236, 
§§ 1-7, at 723-30.
13 Pursuant to Act 236, HRS § 514A-90 then 
provided, in relevant part, that "[t]he lien of the association of apartment owners may be foreclosed by action or by non­judicial or power of sale foreclosure procedures set forth in chapter 667, by the managing agent or board of directors, acting on behalf of the association of apartment owners, in like manner as a mortgage of real property."
14 (Emphasis added.) Thus, the 
1999 amendment clarified that associations could avail themselves of HRS chapter 667 nonjudicial or power of sale procedures, like mortgagees. It is clear, however, that mortgagees could conduct a nonjudicial power of sale only if, inter alia, the subject mortgage contained a power of sale. See generally HRS § 667-5 
(repealed in 2012) and HRS chapter 667, Part II; see also, e.g., Lee v. HSBC, 121 Hawai' i at 292, 218 P.3d at 780 ("no state 
statute creates a right in mortgagees to proceed by non-judicial foreclosure; the right is created by contract"). 
Appellees rely on HRS § 514A-90(a), and the identical
 
provision in HRS § 514B-146(a), by disregarding the language
 indicating that associations were being given access to
 nonjudicial power of sale foreclosure procedures, like
 mortgagees, and that associations were not being granted
 heretofore non-existent statutory powers of sale, now available

 The Legislature specifically stated that part of the purpose of
Act 236 was to "[c]larify that associations of apartment owners may enforce
liens for unpaid common expenses by non-judicial and power of sale foreclosure
procedures, as an alternative to legal action[.]" 1999 Haw. Sess. Laws Act
 236, § 1 at 723-24.
 
14
 In the prior year, 1998, the Hawai 'i Legislature enacted Part II
of HRS chapter 667, creating an alternative power of sale foreclosure process,
i.e., an alternative to foreclosure under power of sale pursuant to HRS § 667­
5. See 1998 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 122, §§ 1 & 2.

only to associations.15 The 1999 amendment to HRS § 514A-90 did
 
not purport to enact a blanket grant of powers of sale to all
 
associations over all apartments/units within those associations. 
There is nothing in the legislative history of Act 236 of 1999 to
 suggest that a grant of powers of sale was even contemplated. 
The text of Act 236 of 1999 specifically states that this
 amendment was intended to clarify that associations could avail
 themselves of less burdensome procedures, i.e., the alternative
 power of sale foreclosure procedures enacted the prior year. See
 
1999 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 236, § 1 at 723-24. As stated earlier,
 we will not infer that the power to extrajudicially sell another
 person's property was granted, in the absence of a clear
 legislative act doing so.
 
The relevant part of HRS § 514A-90 was further amended 
in 2012 as part of a major legislative mortgage reform, Act 182, Session Laws of Hawai' i 2012. Act 182 was the final result of 
Act 162, Session Laws of Hawai' i 2010, which created a Mortgage 
Foreclosure Task Force (Task Force) to study mortgage foreclosure 
policies and to recommend improvements. See 2012 Haw. Sess. Laws 
Act 182, § 1 at 630. In 2011, the Task Force's focus was divided 
into three major issues, which were addressed in the first instance by groups formed within the Task Force. Group #2 of the Task Force was tasked with "[m]atters involving condominium and other homeowner associations, including association liens and the collection of unpaid assessments."

Foreclosure Task Force to the Legislature for the Regular Session of 2012 (December 2011), available at http://lrbhawaii.info/reports/legrpts/2012/mort.pdf at 6 (Final

 In their references to HRS §§ 514A-90, 514B-146, and chapter 667,
Appellees fail to address the statutory references to "in a like manner as a
mortgage of real property," the subsequent developments in the statutes, the
definitions of "nonjudicial foreclosure," "power of sale" and "power of sale
foreclosure," or provide any support for their assertion that HRS §§ 514A-90 &
514B-146 were intended to confer powers of sale upon associations, rather than
provide associations with access to a power of sale foreclosure process.

Task Force Report).16 The Final Task Force Report was 288 pages
 
long and included, inter alia, descriptive summaries of the Task
 
Force's substantive recommendations, as well as presented the
 recommendations in standard legislative bill format. Each part
 of the proposed legislation was preceded by a Comment, which
 briefly explained what was recommended and why the Task Force was
 recommending that particular proposed legislation. In addition,
 the Final Task Force Report included certain Minority Reports
 from Task Force members who remained concerned about how matters
 were resolved or left unresolved due to different views among the
 Task Force members. See generally id.
 
Most notably, Group #2 of the Task Force recommended
 
that the Legislature "[a]mend chapter 667 by adding a new part to
 establish an alternate power of sale process specifically for
 condominium and other homeowner associations and modeled after
 the process set forth in part II of chapter 667, as amended by
 the recommendations of the task force." Id. at 17 & 36-53. In
 
recommending related amendments to HRS § 514A-90, the Task Force
 highlighted limits to be placed on association liens. Id. at 54. 
Without comment, with respect to the part of HRS § 514A-90 that
 is most relevant here, the Task Force recommended deleting "in
 like manner as a mortgage of real property." Id. at 55.
17 It is
 
clear that, with the addition of a new part to HRS chapter 667
 (Part VI) establishing an alternative power of sale process
 specifically for associations, which was modeled after but not
 identical to the process set forth in Part II of HRS chapter 667,
 the reference to "like manner as a mortgage of real property"
 became superfluous, if not confusing. This Task Force

 Pursuant to Act 182, HRS § 514A-90(a) (Supp. 2017) now simply
provides, in relevant part, that "[t]he lien of the association of apartment
owners may be foreclosed by action or by nonjudicial or power of sale
foreclosure procedures set forth in chapter 667, by the managing agent or
board of directors, acting on behalf of the association apartment owners." 
16
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
recommendation was adopted in Act 182. See 2012 Haw. Sess. Laws
 
Act 182, § 9 at 653. However, the Task Force's recommended
 
amendment to HRS § 514A-90 did not purport to enact a blanket
 grant of powers of sale to all associations over all
 apartments/units within those associations. There is nothing in
 the extensive Final Task Force Report or the legislative history
 of Act 182 to suggest that the authority to conduct a power of
 sale foreclosure in the absence of an existing power of sale was
 ever contemplated. Thus, we conclude that HRS § 514A-90 does not
 authorize an association to conduct a nonjudicial or power of
 sale foreclosure other than as provided in HRS chapter 667, which
 in turn does not authorize a nonjudicial power of sale
 foreclosure absent an otherwise existing power of sale.
 
As noted above, HRS § 514B-146 generally applies to all
 
condominiums, including those created before July 1, 2006, with
 respect to events occurring thereafter. See HRS § 514B-22. HRS
 
§ 514B-146 was enacted in 2004 and mirrored HRS § 514A-90. 2004
 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 164, § 2 at 756. In 2012, when Part VI was
 added to HRS chapter 667, HRS § 514B-146 was amended in parallel
 to the above-referenced amendment to HRS § 514A-90. Thus, we
 conclude that, like HRS § 514A-90, HRS § 514B-146 does not
 authorize an association to conduct a nonjudicial or power of
 sale foreclosure other than as provided in HRS chapter 667, which
 does not authorize a nonjudicial or power of sale foreclosure
 absent a power of sale.
 
Finally, Sakal correctly notes that other jurisdictions 
that have granted a power of sale statutorily have done so explicitly; and, Sakal argues that, had the Hawai' i Legislature 
intended to grant such powers, it would have specifically said as much. See, e.g., D.C. Code § 42-1903.13(c)(1) (Westlaw through 
2017 legislation) ("The unit owners' association shall have the 
power of sale to enforce a lien for an assessment against a 
condominium unit if an assessment is past due. By accepting a
deed to a condominium unit, the owner shall be irrevocably deemed 
17
  
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to have appointed the chief executive officer of the unit owners'
 
association as trustee for the purpose of exercising the power of
sale provided for herein.") (emphasis added); Minn. Stat.
 
§ 515B.3-116(h)(1) (2017) ("[T]he association's lien may be
 
foreclosed in a like manner as a mortgage containing a power of
 sale pursuant to chapter 580, or by action pursuant to chapter
 581. The association shall have a power of sale to foreclose the
 
lien pursuant to chapter 580.") (emphasis added); Tex. Prop. Code
 § 82.113(d) (Westlaw through 2013 legislation) ("By acquiring a
unit, a unit owner grants to the association a power of sale in
 
connection with the association's lien.") (emphasis added); N.C.
 
Gen. Stat. § 47F-3-116(f) (Westlaw through 2013 legislation)
 ("[T]he association, acting through the executive board, may
 foreclose a claim of lien in like manner as a mortgage or deed of
 trust on real estate under power of sale, as provided in Article
 2A of Chapter 45 of the General Statutes. . . . The association
 
shall be deemed to have a power of sale for purposes of
enforcement of its claim of lien.") (emphasis added).  Appellees
 point to no such statutory language in Hawai' i law and we find 
none.
18
 
18 We recognize that our holding does not harmonize every aspect of
the statutes affecting nonjudicial power of sale foreclosures by associations.
For example, in HRS § 667-1, "power of sale" or "power of sale foreclosure" is
defined in terms of a "mortgage" that "contains, authorizes, permits, or
provides for a power of sale, a power of sale foreclosure, a power of sale
remedy, or a nonjudicial foreclosure," whereas in HRS § 667-40 and certain
provisions of Part VI of HRS chapter 667, refers to "a law or written
document" that "contains, authorizes, permits, or provides for a power of
sale, a power of sale foreclosure, a power of sale remedy, or a nonjudicial
foreclosure." If a law provided powers of sale to all associations, there
would be no need to reference other written documents; however, the language
suggests that such a law might exist, but we found none. We note, however,
that the nonjudicial power of sale procedures in Part II of HRS chapter 667
are expressly made available to associations through HRS § 667-40, where such
powers exist, but other parts of Part II are an ill fit for associations.
See, e.g., HRS § 667-32(a)(1) (requiring "the foreclosing mortgagee" to file
an affidavit under penalty of perjury stating, inter alia , "that the power of
sale foreclosure was made pursuant to the power of sale provision in the
mortgage"). Especially in light of other aspects of Part II of HRS chapter
667 that cannot be read literally as to association foreclosures, we conclude
that the ambiguous references to "a law or written document" is too thin a
reed on which to support a statutory power of sale. Nevertheless, we delved

3. The Bylaws
 
On appeal, Kogen contends that Article VI of the
 
Bylaws, as alleged in the Complaint, provides the AOAO with the
 
authority to use "any other remedies that the [AOAO] may have,"
 which Kogen argues includes the remedy of nonjudicial
 foreclosure. The AOAO points to the part of Article VI of the
 Bylaws stating that "the [AOAO] shall have all remedies provided
 in Section 514A-90, HRS." Section 4 of Article VI of the Bylaws,
 as alleged in the Complaint, states as follows:
 
In the event of a default or defaults in payment of
any such assessment or assessments and in addition to any
other remedies the [AOAO] may have, the [AOAO] may enforce
each such obligation as follows:
(a) By suit or suits to enforce such obligations. . .
(b) . . . [T]he [AOAO] may file a claim of lien
against the Apartment of such delinquent Owner. . . . Upon
recordation of a duly executed original or copy of such
claim of lien with the Office of the Assistant Registrar of
the Land Court of the State of Hawaii, the [AOAO] shall have
all remedies provided in Section 514A-90, HRS. 
(Emphasis added).
 
Addressing the interpretation of condominium bylaws,
 
the supreme court has stated: 
Indeed, bylaws generally establish the rules governing
the condominium. See Raines v. Palm Beach Leisureville
 
Cmty. Ass'n, 413 So.2d 30, 32 (Fla.1982) ("[A] condominium
association derives its powers, duties, and responsibilities
from [Florida Statutes] chapter 718 and from the
association's declaration of restrictions and bylaws.");
Bradford Square Condo. Ass'n v. Miller, 258 Ga.App. 240, 573
S.E.2d 405, 409 (2002) ("The condominium instruments,
including the bylaws and the sales agreement, are a contract
that governs the legal rights between the [a]ssociation and
unit owners."); Chapman Place Ass'n, Inc. v. Prokasky, 507
N.W.2d 858, 863 (Minn.Ct.App.1993) ("[T]he condominium act,
in conjunction with the [d]eclaration and the
[a]ssociation's by-laws, governs the rights of the
[a]ssociation and condominium unit owners."); Lion Square

further into the history of statutory lien rights of associations, from when
they were first enacted as part of the first Horizontal Property Act in 1961,
when they were amended in 1963, and through the present. See 1961 Haw. Sess.
 
Laws Act 180, § 15 at 276; 1963 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 101, § 22 at 88; HRS
 § 514-24(a) (1968) (repealed in 1977); HRS §§ 514A-90 and 514B-146. Nothing
in the legislation or legislative history of Hawai 'i condominium law supports
a conclusion that, at any time, the Legislature enacted or intended to enact a
statute granting powers of sale over all condominiums in the State to their
respective associations.

declaration and bylaws.").
 
Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Maalaea Kai, Inc. v. Stillson, 108 
Hawai'i 2, 9, 116 P.3d 644, 651 (2005). 
Contracts and agreements must be construed as a whole, 
not from any particular word, phrase, or clause. Santiago, 137 
Hawai'i at 155, 366 P.3d at 630 (citing Ching v. Hawai' ian Rests., 
Ltd., 50 Haw. 563, 565, 445 P.2d 370, 372 (1968)). Ambiguity is construed against the drafter. Id. (citing Luke v. Gentry 
Realty, Ltd., 105 Hawai' i 241, 249, 96 P.3d 261, 269 (2004)). 
In Santiago, the supreme court examined whether a power
 
of sale was contained in a mortgage, in conjunction with a
 nonjudicial power of sale foreclosure conducted pursuant to HRS
 § 667-5 (repealed in 2012). Id. at 155-56, 366 P.3d at 630-31. 
The subject mortgage in Santiago stated that, upon a default on
 the mortgage, the lender may foreclose on the mortgage by court
 proceeding or "as now or then provided by law, by advertisement
 and sale of the mortgaged property . . . at public auction[.]" 
Id. at 155, 366 P.3d at 630. The supreme court found this phrase
 ambiguous when read in conjunction with HRS § 667-5, explaining
 that, inter alia, "[t]he plain language of the Mortgage creates a
 chicken-and-egg situation where it is not clear whether the power
 of sale is created within the document (as required by the
 statute) or created within the statute (as contemplated by the
 Mortgage)." Id. Construing the ambiguity against the drafter,
 
the supreme court concluded that the subject mortgage only
 allowed nonjudicial foreclosure as provided by law, that the
 applicable foreclosure law required that a power of sale be
 contained in a mortgage, and, as there was no power of sale in
 the mortgage, the nonjudicial foreclosure sale in that case was
 unlawful. Id. at 155-56, 366 P.3d at 630-31.
 
20
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Here, like in Santiago, the Bylaws generally refer to
 
the remedies provided under the law, namely HRS § 514A-90. 
Because, as discussed above, HRS § 514A-90 and HRS § 514B-146 do
 not grant a power of sale to the AOAO, and the applicable
 nonjudicial power of sale foreclosure laws require a power of
 sale provision be provided by law or in the governing documents,
 the reference to HRS § 514A-90 creates a similar "chicken-and­egg" problem as in Santiago. We construe the ambiguity against
 the drafter - the AOAO - and conclude that the Bylaws do not
 unambiguously give the AOAO a power of sale over its units and,
 as discussed above, HRS §§ 514A-90 and 514B-146 allow
 associations to utilize nonjudicial power of sale foreclosure
 procedures, as well as to proceed by judicial action, but do not
 grant associations powers of sale over all condominium units. 
Thus, the AOAO's nonjudicial power of sale foreclosure of Sakal's
 unit was not authorized by the Bylaws.
 
Accordingly, as neither the Bylaws nor the statutes
 
relied on by Appellees contain a grant of a power of sale, we
 conclude that the Circuit Court erred in concluding that Sakal
 failed to state any legally-cognizable claim for relief based on
 the theory that the AOAO's nonjudicial foreclosure sale of the
 Property was unauthorized and unlawful.
 
B. HRS § 667-102 
Appellees also argue, and the Circuit Court further
 
concluded, that HRS § 667-102(b) (2016) bars Sakal's claims
 because they were not made before the Affidavit and the Quitclaim
 Deed were filed. That section of Part VI of the Foreclosures
 statute provides, in relevant part:
§ 667-102 Recordation of affidavit, conveyance
document; effect.  (a) The affidavit required under section
667-101 and the conveyance document shall be recorded no
earlier than ten days after the public sale is held but not
later than forty-five days after the public sale is held.
The affidavit and the conveyance document may be recorded
separately and on different days. . . . 
(b) When both the affidavit and the conveyance
document are recorded:
 
21
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(1) 	The sale of the unit is considered completed;
 
(2) 	All persons claiming by, through, or under the
unit owner and all other persons having liens on
the unit junior to the lien of the association
shall be forever barred of and from any and all
right, title, interest, and claims at law or in
equity in and to the unit and every part of the
unit, except as otherwise provided by law;
 
(3) 	The lien of the association and all liens junior
in priority to the lien of an association shall
be automatically extinguished from the unit; and
 
(4) 	The purchaser shall be entitled to immediate and
exclusive possession of the unit.
 
HRS § 667-102(a) & (b) (emphasis added).
 
Sakal argues, however, that he is not barred from 
asserting his right to title and interest in the subject property 
based on the "except as otherwise provided by law" clause in HRS § 667-102(b)(2). Relying principally on the supreme court's decision in Lee v. HSBC, Sakal contends that for a nonjudicial foreclosure sale to be valid, the foreclosing party must strictly comply with the requirements of the subject contract and statute. With respect to his claim to the subject Property, we reject Sakal's contention. Lee v. HSBC is distinguishable. In that 
case, the plaintiff was the high bidder at a foreclosure auction. 121 Hawai' i at 288, 218 P.3d at 776. However, prior to the 
auction (unbeknownst to the lender's attorney), and prior to the auctioned property being conveyed, the mortgagors cured their delinquency on the mortgage loan. Id. Under the power of sale 
clause in the subject mortgage, the mortgagee could only exercise its power of sale if the mortgage loan was in default and, therefore, the sale was invalid pursuant to HRS § 667-5, which required the mortgage agreement to be in breach in order to conduct a nonjudicial power of sale foreclosure. Id. at 290-91, 
218 P.3d at 778-79. Accordingly, the supreme court held that the 
22
   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
nonjudicial foreclosure sale was void and unenforceable by the
 
plaintiff/high bidder. Id. at 292, 218 P.3d at 780.19
 
The most significant distinction between the case at
 
bar and Lee v. HSBC is that the conveyance of the subject
 property to the high bidder in Lee v. HSBC had not yet occurred. 
We also recognize that the nonjudicial power of sale foreclosure
 sale in Lee v. HSBC was conducted pursuant to HRS § 667-5
 (repealed in 2012) and not Part II of HRS chapter 667. Even if
 the nonjudicial power of sale foreclosure had been conducted
 pursuant to Part II, the recordation referenced in HRS § 667-33 –
 which is the exact parallel provision in Part II of HRS chapter
 667 that HRS § 667-102 was modeled after – had not yet
 occurred.
20 Thus, Lee v. HSBC does not establish or explicate an
 
exception to HRS § 667-33 and HRS § 667-102. We reject, however,
 the AOAO's assertion that Lee v. HSBC is irrelevant solely
 because it involved a mortgage foreclosure, rather than an

mortgaged property, except as otherwise provided

association lien foreclosure. As discussed above, Appellees have
 
cited no authority for the proposition that the Legislature
 intended to provide associations with nonjudicial foreclosure
 powers other than pursuant to a power of sale, like mortagees,
 and we find none. Indeed, our review of the development of the
 nonjudicial foreclosure laws applicable to associations confirms
 that the Legislature intended to provide associations with
 essentially the same nonjudicial foreclosure procedures available
 to mortgagees, which were then better tailored for associations
 in Act 182 with the provisions now set forth in Part VI of HRS
 chapter 667.
 
Turning back to HRS § 667-102, set forth above, we 
conclude that the statutory language is clear and unambiguous. Having failed to challenge the nonjudicial power of sale foreclosure of the Property prior to the recordation of the Affidavit and the Quitclaim Deed, Sakal is now barred by HRS § 667-102(b)(2) from any claim to the Property itself. The Hawai'i Supreme Court has upheld a similar limit contained in HRS 
§ 501-118 (2006), which bars any challenge to the transfer of title of foreclosed land court property after the issuance of a new TCT. See Aames Funding Corp. v. Mores, 107 Hawai' i 95, 110 
P.3d 1042. Although not directly applicable here, because no new TCT was issued upon the conveyance of the Property to Kogen, Aames supports the enforceability of a bar to a challenge to a completed transfer of title such as the one in HRS § 667-102.
21 
The AOAO appears to further argue that HRS § 667-102
 
operates as a complete bar to any claim by Sakal for wrongful
 foreclosure, and not just Sakal's claim to title to the Property. 
This argument is without merit. HRS § 667-102 plainly bars any
 claim "in and to the unit and every part of the unit." It does
 not bar, generally, all claims arising out of wrongful and
 unlawful nonjudicial foreclosure by associations. The supreme
 
21
 On appeal, Kogen no longer claims that HRS § 501-118 and the
holding in Aames are directly applicable to bar Sakal's claims.
 
24
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
court recently recognized the viability of wrongful foreclosure 
claims arising out of an allegedly unlawful nonjudicial power of sale foreclosure, albeit based on alleged failures to comply with requirements not at issue in this case. See Hungate v. Law 
Office of David B. Rosen, 139 Hawai' i 394, 402-04, 391 P.3d 1, 9­
11 (2017); see also Santiago, 137 Hawai' i at 158, 366 P.3d at 633 
(where a nonjudicial foreclosure sale is wrongful, but the sale to an innocent purchaser for value has been completed, an action at law for damages is generally the appropriate remedy). Here, Sakal's complaint seeks, inter alia, "damages resulting from the wrongful nonjudicial foreclosure and subsequent eviction of Mr. Sakal from his home." It appears that Sakal has stated a claim for wrongful foreclosure against the AOAO upon which some relief may be granted. Thus, we conclude that the Circuit Court erred in dismissing Sakal's complaint in its entirety against the AOAO.
22 
V. CONCLUSION
 
For the reasons stated above, the Circuit Court's
 
August 5, 2015 Judgment is affirmed in part and vacated in part. 
We affirm the Circuit Court's dismissal of all claims against
 Kogen, as well as all claims, at law or in equity, against the
 AOAO that seek any right, title, or interest in and to the
 Property. We vacate the Circuit Court's dismissal of Sakal's
 claims for damages against the AOAO arising out of wrongful 
22
 Although arguably sufficient for notice pleading standards,
Sakal's claim for damages is not particularly clear. However, Sakal does not
argue, and cites no authority for the proposition, that he can bring a
wrongful foreclosure claim against the buyer of the foreclosed property.
Indeed, in light of HRS § 667-102(b)(4), cited above, Kogen's actions in
evicting Sakal from the Property were authorized by statute and not wrongful.
