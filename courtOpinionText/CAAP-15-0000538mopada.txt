For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.

I. Background
 
This matter involves a 1991 License Agreement between 
 
A&B and Blake, as Vice-President of Kawahinehelelani, Inc. dba Na

Pohaku (KI). Plaintiffs initiated this action by filing a
 
"Complaint for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction and for

Damages" (Complaint) on July 22, 2014, alleging nine counts
 
stemming from allegations going back to "sometime in 1992 or

early 1993[.]"2 The Complaint alleges in relevant part:

7. On or about August 1, 1991, Defendant A&B entered
into a license agreement with Plaintiffs predecessor in
interest, "Kawahinehelelani Inc." (KI) and Blake to allow KIand Blake to rent a portion of real property at Kukui 'ula 
(the yard) and for the purpose of propagation of moss andlichen on Pahoehoe rock and to conduct harvesting of rockupon Defendant A&B's property located at Kukui 'ula. In 
return, KI and Blake would pay an agreed upon rent price andsupply Defendant A&B with a portion of the rock theyharvested. 
8. The license agreement was signed on December 11,
1991 with an effective date of August 1, 1991. The License

Agreement was drafted by Defendant A&B. 
 
9. Sometime in 1992 or early 1993, KI and Blake were
effectively locked out of their yard by Defendant A&B'sgeneral contractor at Kukui 'ula, Kiewit Corporation. Upon
information and belief, this was done, in part, to excludeBlake and KI workers from witnessing the intentional and/ornegligent destruction of at least one Hawaiianarchaeological site by Defendant A&B's general contractor,Kiewit Construction Company ("Kiewit") and to allowDefendant A&B to take possession of all of the harvestedrock. 
10. Upon information and belief, by this time KI and
Blake had harvested approximately twenty-four thousand(24,000) cubic yards of rock, which was stored at their yardat Kukui 'ula pursuant to the license agreement. Plaintiffs 
work product, the rocks, was subsequently wrongfully seizedby Defendant A&B and Plaintiffs were denied access toretrieve the rock and denied the opportunity to continuetheir business by Defendant A&B. 
2
 The Complaint alleges the following counts: Count I,
Injunctive Relief; Count II, Conversion; Count III, Negligence;
Count IV, Unjust Enrichment; Count V, Breach of Contract; Count
VI, Negligent and/or Intentional Misrepresentation; Count VII,
Violation of HRS Chapter 480; Count VIII, Breach of the Implied
Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; and Count IX, Respondeat
Superior.

11. Plaintiffs predecessor KI, and Blake, and later
joined by Moniz, attempted on several occasions to attempt
to retrieve their property but were denied by Defendant A&B.
Defendant A&B claimed that Plaintiffs had "abandoned" the
 rock and the yard. Plaintiffs denied this, yet A&B
continued to maintain its position of "abandonment." Blake
 and Moniz have filed a police report (Report # 2014-03467)
with the Kauai Police Department alleging the wrongful
taking of their property of Defendant A&B.
 
(Emphasis added).
 
The Complaint further alleges that A&B continued to
 
send Blake and KI invoices pursuant to the License Agreement up
 
to December 2013, and that Moniz made a payment by check in the
 amount of $100, to be applied to the back rent, which A&B cashed
 in or around December 2013.
 
On April 2, 2015, A&B filed a motion for summary
 
judgment arguing that all of Plaintiffs' claims were barred by
 applicable statutes of limitations,
3 the doctrine of laches
 
barred Plaintiffs' claims, and the License Agreement was
 abandoned and there were no genuine issues of material fact. 
A&B adduced evidence in support of its summary judgment
 
motion, including the following: (1) Declaration of Tom Shigemoto
 (Shigemoto), Vice President of A&B; (2) Declaration of Charles W.
 
Loomis (Loomis), Associate General Counsel and Assistant
 
Secretary of A&B; and (3) Declaration of George W. Van Buren (Van
 
Buren), attorney for A&B. Shigemoto attested, inter alia, that
 
he has been employed at A&B since August 1991 and it is A&B's
 
practice to send letters terminating a license that is in default
 and would expect such a letter to be in the subject file; the
 license was in default; he believes a letter terminating the
 license was sent; "[a]fter 1993 everybody treated the license as
 terminated"; and "the license for all purposes including payment
 and use was abandoned." 
Loomis attested, inter alia, that in his capacity as
 
Associate General Counsel and Assistant Secretary of A&B, he is
 
3
 A&B asserted, and it was not disputed below, that a
statute of limitations of either two, four, or six years applied
to the respective counts asserted in the Complaint.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the custodian of business records for A&B; he has been employed
 
with A&B since 1989; that it is A&B's practice to send letters
 terminating a license that is in default and he would expect such
 a letter to be in the subject file; that the file for the subject
 license was destroyed as part of A&B's normal document management
 program; Exhibit 5 is a copy of A&B's accounting records kept in
 the normal course of business under his custody and control,
 which reflects the license was in default as of 1993; Exhibit 6
 is an A&B business record kept in the normal course of business
 under his custody and control, indicating the subject license was
 terminated; and Exhibit 7 was a Certificate of Destruction from
 Crown Records Management showing the subject file was destroyed
 in 1998. 
Attached to the declarations in support of A&B’s motion 
were certain relevant documents:
4 (1) the License Agreement 
between A&B and Blake/KI, which Moniz had previously submitted in the case, which grants to Blake/KI a license for the use of certain premises located in Kôloa, Hawai� i "for the purpose of 
propogation [sic] of moss and lichens on pahoehoe rock[,]" (and which does not indicate a license to harvest rocks); (2) Exhibit 5, titled "A&B Properties, Inc. Tenant A/R Daily Summary Report", showing Blake as the tenant, which indicates an outstanding balance starting in mid-1992 and as of January 1994, an amount owing of $9,333.99; (3) Exhibit 6, which has a reference to "Blake, Theodore K." and "Propagation of moss an [sic] lichens on pahoehoe rock", and which states "TERMINATION: 12/21/1993 _ effective 12/21/1993"; and (4) a copy of a Certificate of Destruction from Crown Records Management which appears to indicate that the file related to the license was destroyed in 1999. 
In opposition to A&B's summary judgment motion, Moniz
 
argued that the claims in the Complaint were not time barred,
 
4
 There is no challenge to the admissibility of the
documents submitted to the circuit court.
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
laches does not apply, and there was no abandonment. With regard
 
to applicable statutes of limitations, Moniz asserted the
 Complaint was filed "within the 2 to 6 year [statute of
 limitations] that apply to all of Plaintiffs['] claims." Moniz
 adduced the following evidence in opposition to the summary
 judgment motion: (1) Declaration of Moniz; (2) Declaration of
 Blake; and (3) Declaration of Hartwell H. K. Blake (Hartwell).
 
Of note, Blake attested, inter alia, that: he was the 
Vice President and Director of KI and successor in interest of the corporation; he was primarily responsible for all operations at the subject location at Kukui� ula from 1991 to 1993; upon the 
destruction of an auwai system located on the Kukui� ula property 
by agents of A&B (Kiewit), he reported the destruction to A&B; 
"the destruction of the auwai system in 1992 and my reporting of 
the same caused adverse relations for us with Kiewit and Defendant A&B"; "[f]rom this point forward, we had strained relationships with Defendant A&B and Kiewit . . . We began to get locked out of our yard by Kiewit machinery blocking access to the yard and refusing to remove its machinery to allow access"; "I decided to cease harvesting operations in 1993 to prevent confrontation between our workers, who were mostly Native Hawaiian, and A&B and Kiewitt [sic]" and "[t]o the best of my knowledge, we had harvested approximately 24,000 cubic yards of rock by this time." (Emphasis added). 
Blake further attested that he had entered a verbal 
agreement with Bill Campbell (Campbell) of A&B in June of 1991 
that "we would leave our harvested rocks on the Kukui� ula 
property until needed and/or purchased by A&B or its agents and 
that 50% of the rock we harvested would belong to Defendant A&B." Blake also attested that from 1993 to 2002, he received monthly invoices from A&B for rent due under the License Agreement, and that he did not receive a letter terminating the License Agreement. 
Attached to the declarations in opposition to the
 
summary judgment motion were the following relevant documents:
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
various statements referencing dates between 2008 and 2013 from
 
"A&B Properties, Inc.", all indicating a balance forward and
 amount due of $9,333.99; and a check made payable to "A&B
 Properties, Inc." for $100 from South Pac Holdings LLC, which
 Moniz attested he mailed to A&B on or about November 29, 2013,
 and that was cashed by A&B on December 2, 2013.
 
On June 19, 2015, the circuit court filed its order
 
granting A&B's summary judgment motion and the Judgment against
 Plaintiffs.
 
II. Discussion
 
We review a trial court's grant of summary judgment de 
novo. Kamaka v. Goodsill Anderson Quinn & Stifel, 117 Hawai� i 
92, 104, 176 P.3d 91, 103 (2008). 
Plaintiffs primarily contend that summary judgment for
 
A&B was improper because A&B's assertion of abandonment is a non-
issue given that the License Agreement was not terminated as
 required under its terms and Blake's agreement with Campbell
 allowed Plaintiffs to keep harvested rocks on A&B property. 
Thus, Plaintiffs contend this is not a typical contract breach
 case where "accrual logically begins at the time of injury[,]"
 because both contracts are still in effect. Plaintiffs' other
 primary argument is that the statute of limitation was "reset"
 and a new limitations period began to run because Plaintiffs made
 partial payment in 2013 of the outstanding amount owing, which
 A&B accepted. We conclude all of Plaintiffs' arguments lack
 merit. 
As noted above, the License Agreement, effective August
 
1, 1991, provided that A&B granted Blake and KI a "license for
 the use of certain premises . . . for the purpose of propogation
 [sic] of moss and lichens on pahoehoe rock" for a license fee of
 $180.00 per month. The Complaint alleges that KI and Blake were
 effectively locked out of the subject property "[s]ometime in
 1992 or early 1993[.]" Similarly, Blake's declaration attests
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that after he reported the destruction of an auwai system to A&B
 
in 1992, "[w]e began to get locked out of our yard by Kiewit
 machinery blocking access to the yard and refusing to remove its
 machinery to allow access" and that he decided to cease
 harvesting operations in 1993 to prevent confrontation between
 his workers and A&B/Kiewit.
 
Based on their Complaint, as well as the declaration of
 
Blake, all of Plaintiffs' claims stem from and arise out of being
 "effectively locked out" or having their access to the property
 blocked in 1992 or 1993. Plaintiffs did not file their Complaint
 until July 22, 2014, more than twenty years after they were aware
 that they were being "locked out" or were being blocked from
 accessing the property and the rocks they claim were harvested by
 KI.
 
As asserted by A&B, and not disputed by Plaintiffs, the
 
applicable statute of limitations for all of the counts in the
 Complaint range from two to six years. The Complaint was thus
 filed long after all statutes of limitations, respectively, had
 expired.
 
Plaintiffs' arguments and evidence to the effect that
 
they did not receive any notice of termination of the License
 Agreement is immaterial. Based on the claims asserted in the
 Complaint, the Plaintiffs' claims arise from being "locked out"
 of the property to conduct their business under the License
 Agreement, and also not being able to access the rocks that KI
 had harvested prior to being locked out.
5 In our view, whether
 
5
 We additionally note that if records terminating the
License Agreement were necessary it would defeat one of the
purposes of a statute of limitations, which is that claims should
be timely asserted before evidence related to the claims no
longer exist. See Cochran v. Pflueger Automobiles, Inc., 72 Haw.
460, 464, 821 P.2d 934, 936 (1991) (citation and internal
brackets omitted) ("A statute of limitations is designed to
(continued...)
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
A&B gave notice of terminating the License Agreement is not
 
pertinent to whether the statute of limitations has run on the
 claims asserted in the Complaint.
 
Further, to the extent that Plaintiffs' claims are
 
based on the contention that their "work product, the rocks" were
 wrongfully seized and they were denied access "to retrieve the
 rock[s]," there are two reasons these claims fail as a matter of
 law. First, Plaintiffs knew or should have known in 1993, when
 they assert they were "locked out" of the property, that they
 were being denied access to their claimed rocks regardless of any
 agreement with Campbell about leaving rocks on the property. 
Second, notwithstanding Plaintiffs' assertion that they had a
 right to "harvest" rocks, the License Agreement does not so
 provide. Rather, the License Agreement simply allowed Blake/KI
 use of the designated premises "for the purpose of propogation
 [sic] of moss and lichens on pahoehoe rock." The License
 Agreement contains no language to the effect that Blake/KI could
 harvest or take ownership of rocks on the property.
 
We also conclude that the payment of $100 in November
 
2013, attested to by Moniz, did not "reset" the applicable
 statutes of limitations for Plaintiffs' claims against A&B in
 this case. Citing to First Hawaiian Bank v. Zukerkorn, 2 Haw.
 App. 383, 633 P.2d 550 (1981), Plaintiffs argue that "the
 acknowledgment or partial payment of the debt evidences an intent
 to make future payment by which the debtor is in a sense renewing
 the agreement to pay the moneys due under the otherwise lapsed
 contract." Plaintiffs' reliance on Zukerkorn and related
 
5(...continued)
preclude a stale claim where the other party must gather evidence
after time has dissipated memories, documents and realevidence."); First Hawaiian Bank v. Powers, 93 Hawai� i 174, 187,
998 P.2d 55, 68 (App. 2000) (citation omitted) ("Statutes oflimitations attempt to protect against the difficulties caused bylost evidence, faded memories and disappearing witnesses."). 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
authority is misplaced. As expressed in Zukerkorn, "[a] new
 
promise by the debtor to pay his debt, whether then barred by the
 applicable statute of limitations or not, binds the debtor for a
 new limitations period." Id. at 385, 633 P.2d at 552 (emphasis
 
added). As argued by A&B, the rule expressed in Zukerkorn
 applies to extend the statute of limitation to assert claims
 against the debtor. It does not apply to the circumstances in
 this case, where Plaintiffs (the debtors) have paid part of an
 outstanding amount and seek to revive time-barred claims they
 wish to now assert.
 
Finally, Plaintiffs also contend that the circuit court
 
should have permitted Plaintiffs to conduct discovery pursuant to
 HRCP Rule 56(f).
 
Rule 56(f) allows a party to request a delay in granting
summary judgment if the party can make a good faith showing
that postponement of the ruling would enable it to discover
additional evidence which might rebut the movant's showing
of the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. The
party is required to show what specific facts further
discovery might unveil.
 
Exotics Hawaii-Kona, Inc. v. E.I. Du Pont De Nemours & Co., 116 
Hawai�i 277, 308, 172 P.3d 1021, 1052 (2007) (emphasis in 
original) (citation omitted); U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n v. Salvacion, 134 Hawai� i 170, 176, 338 P.3d 1185, 1191 (App. 2014) (citation 
omitted) (a request for HRCP Rule 56(f) continuance "must demonstrate how postponement of a ruling on the motion will enable the moving party, by discovery or other means, to rebut the movant's showing of absence of a genuine issue of fact"). 
Plaintiffs rely on the declaration of Moniz submitted
 
in opposition to the summary judgment motion, which included a
 request for a continuance under HRCP Rule 56(f) to take the
 depositions of Loomis, Shigemoto, and Trinette Kaui (Kaui). 
Moniz's declaration noted that Kaui's name appears as a contact
 
person on the invoices received by Plaintiffs. Moniz's
 declaration provides no explanation as to what specific facts
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
further discovery might unveil. Because we review the circuit
 
court's determination for an abuse of discretion, and given our
 review of the record, we conclude the circuit court did not err
 in effectively denying Moniz's HRCP Rule 56(f) request for a
 continuance of the summary judgment motion.
III. Conclusion
 
Based on the above, the Judgment entered on June 19,
 
2015, in the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit is affirmed.
