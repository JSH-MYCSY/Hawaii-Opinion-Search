OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
JOHN RAPP, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
THOMAS F. SCHMIDT and LORINNA J. SCHMIDT,
Defendants-Appellants
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 94-0903)
MEMORANDUM OPINION
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Chan, JJ.)
This appeal arises out of post-judgment proceedings in
a civil action brought by Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/
Appellee John Rapp (Rapp) against Defendants/Counterclaim-
Plaintiffs/Appellants Thomas F. Schmidt and Lorinna J. Schmidt
(the Schmidts) for an alleged breach of contract.  The Schmidts
appeal from  the April 20, 2015 order granting a motion to
correct a clerical error in a prior order granting a motion to
extend judgments that had been entered against the Schmidts,
filed in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit court).21
1As discussed infra in footnote 8, in their Notice of Appeal, the
Schmidts purport to appeal from the July 8, 2015 order denying the Schmidts'
motion to vacate.  However, this appeal is correctly characterized as an appeal
from the April 20, 2015 order granting the motion to correct.

proceedings after September 8, 2014.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
The Schmidts also challenge the July 8, 2015 order denying the
Schmidts' motion to vacate the April 20, 2015 order.
I.  BACKGROUND
On March 10, 1994, Rapp filed a civil complaint against
the Schmidts for breach of contract, alleging that the Schmidts
owed legal fees to Rapp.  The Schmidts asserted a counterclaim
against Rapp for breach of contract, legal malpractice, and
unfair and deceptive trade practices.  After the conclusion of a
jury trial, on August 29, 1995, the circuit court  entered its
Judgment on Special Verdict in favor of Rapp and against the
Schmidts for $273,143.92.  The Judgment on Special Verdict
dismissed the Schmidts' counterclaims.3
The circuit court subsequently resolved Rapp's motions
for prejudgment interest, attorneys' fees, and costs.  On
October 23, 1995, the circuit court entered a Supplemental
Judgment that additionally awarded Rapp prejudgment interest in
the amount of $66,003.53, attorney's fees in the amount of
$145,601.00, and costs in the amount of $5,028.74.
On November 13, 1995, the Schmidts appealed from the
Supplemental Judgment.  On January 26, 1998, this court entered a
summary disposition order that affirmed the substantive portion
of the Supplemental Judgment, but vacated the portion awarding
Rapp attorney's fees.  Rapp v. Schmidt, No. 19393 (Haw. App.
Jan. 26, 1998) (SDO).  The case was remanded to the circuit court
for redetermination of Rapp's award of attorney's fees.
On December 29, 2000, after remand, the circuit court
entered a post-judgment order that redetermined Rapp's award of
attorney's fees.  On the same day, the circuit court entered an
Amended Supplemental Judgment in light of the redetermined award
of attorney's fees.4
3The Honorable Daniel G. Heely presided over the trial proceedings.
4The Honorable Karen N. Blondin was assigned to this matter on
February 28, 2000.

On February 18, 2000, notice was given that Turlington
Corporation (Turlington) was assigned Rapp's rights in and to all
judgments entered in the proceeding against the Schmidts.
On August 26, 2005, Turlington filed a motion to extend
the earlier judgments for another ten years (Motion to Extend),
pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 657-5 (Supp. 2005).
The Schmidts did not file a memorandum in opposition.
On September 27, 2005, the circuit court  held a
hearing on the Motion to Extend.  At the hearing, counsel for the
Schmidts asserted that the judgments had already been paid and
also requested a continuance of the hearing so that the Schmidts
could file a motion for satisfaction of the judgments.  The
circuit court clarified that the issue before it was whether to
grant the extensions and that the parties' dispute over whether
the judgments have been paid was a separate issue.  The circuit
court opined that the issue of whether the judgments have been
paid was a matter that could be resolved outside of a court
hearing, "but if deemed necessary, the [circuit court would] have
a hearing if you need one."5
On March 13, 2006, the circuit court filed an order
granting Turlington's Motion to Extend (Order Granting Motion to
Extend).  The circuit court ordered as follows:
[P]ursuant to H.R.S. § 657-5, the life of the Judgment On
Special Verdict in favor of Plaintiff John Rapp and against
Defendants Thomas F. Schmidt and Lorinna J. Schmidt entered
on [sic] in this action August 29, 1995 is extended for an
additional ten (10) years from August 29, 1995 and that the
life of the Supplemental Judgment in favor of Plaintiff John
Rapp and against Defendants Thomas F. Schmidt and Lorinna J.
Schmidt entered in this action on October 23, 1995, is
extended for an additional ten (10) years from October 23,
1995.
On April 12, 2006, the Schmidts appealed from the Order
Granting Motion to Extend.  On August 29, 2008, this court
entered a summary disposition order, affirming the Order Granting

Motion to Extend, rejecting the Schmidts' points of error, and
holding: (1) the Schmidts were provided adequate notice of the
hearing on the Motion to Extend; (2) the circuit court did not
abuse its discretion in denying the Schmidts' request for a
continuance to show that the judgments were satisfied; and (3)
the Schmidts failed to show that their due process rights were
violated in this case.  Rapp v. Schmidt, No. 27883, 2008 WL
4001189 (Haw. App. Aug. 29, 2008) (SDO).  On November 20, 2008,
this court entered judgment pursuant to the August 29, 2008
summary disposition order.
On September 8, 2014, Turlington filed an ex parte
motion for a writ of execution, seeking to collect on the
Judgment on Special Verdict and the Supplemental Judgment (the
Rapp Judgments).  On October 3, 2014, the circuit court  issued a
Writ of Execution against three properties on Moloka#i owned by
the Schmidts ( Moloka#i Properties).6
On January 14, 2015, Turlington filed a motion to
correct a clerical error in the Order Granting Motion to Extend
(Motion to Correct), pursuant to Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure
(HRCP) Rule 60(a).  Turlington sought to amend the Order Granting
Motion to Extend "to state that the life of the judgments entered
on August 29, 1995 and October 23, 1995 are each extended for ten
years from the tenth anniversary of said judgments instead of
from the dates when the judgments were entered in 1995."
On January 23, 2015, Lorinna J. Schmidt filed an
opposition to the Motion to Correct, asserting, inter alia , that
Turlington was not entitled to relief under HRCP Rule 60(a), the
Rapp Judgments had been paid, and that Turlington was not the
true owner of the Rapp Judgments.  Thomas F. Schmidt joined in
the opposition to the Motion to Correct.
6The Honorable Karen T. Nakasone was assigned to this matter on
September 8, 2014, and presided over the proceedings on remand following the
Schmidts' appeal from the Order Granting Motion to Extend.
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
On April 20, 2015, the circuit court entered its order
granting Turlington's Motion to Correct (Order Granting Motion to
Correct).
On April 29, 2015, Lorinna J. Schmidt filed a motion
seeking to vacate the Order Granting Motion to Correct and to
enter satisfaction of the Rapp Judgments (Motion to Vacate).
Lorinna J. Schmidt again asserted that the previous judgments had
already been paid and satisfied and that "the record must be
corrected to so establish that fact."  The Motion to Vacate was
brought pursuant to HRCP Rules 59 and 60(b)(3)-(6).  Thomas F.
Schmidt joined in the Motion to Vacate.
On June 24, 2015, the Schmidts filed a motion to stay
the execution of the Rapp Judgments, cancel the proposed sale of
the Moloka#i Properties, and permit the Schmidts to use the
Moloka#i Properties as security in lieu of a regular supersedeas
bond (Motion to Stay).
On July 8, 2015, the circuit court entered its order
denying the Schmidts' Motion to Vacate (Order Denying Motion to
Vacate).
On July 13, 2015, the circuit court held a hearing on
the Schmidts' Motion to Stay, where it orally denied the motion
based on Turlington's representation that the auction sale would
be postponed until July 31, 2015.  It appears no written order
was filed.
On July 21, 2015, the Schmidts filed a notice of
appeal, purportedly appealing the Order Denying Motion to Vacate,
resulting in the instant appeal.7
7Although the Schmidts purport to appeal from the Order Denying
Motion to Vacate, the appealable final post-judgment order is the April 20, 2015
Order Granting Motion to Correct.  See HRS § 641-1(a) (2016) (authorizing appeals
from final judgments, orders or decrees); Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 Hawai#i 153, 157,
80 P.3d 974, 978 (2003) ("A post-judgment order is an appealable final order
under HRS § 641-1(a) if the order ends the proceedings, leaving nothing further
to be accomplished." (citations omitted)).  The Order Granting Motion to Correct
adjudicated all the issues in Turlington's January 14, 2015 Motion to Correct and
left no further issues from that post-judgment motion for any further
adjudication.  Lorinna J. Schmidt's April 29, 2015 Motion to Vacate extended the
time period to appeal.  See Hawai#i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
II.  POINTS OF ERROR
On appeal, the Schmidts contend that the circuit court
erred in: (1) denying the Motion to Vacate and refusing to enter
a satisfaction of judgments against the Schmidts; (2) granting
Turlington's Motion to Correct; and (3) refusing to stay
execution on the Rapp Judgments.
III.  STANDARDS OF REVIEW
"A circuit court's grant or denial of a motion to
vacate is reviewed for abuse of discretion."  Sierra Club v.
Dep't of Trans., 120 Hawai#i 181, 197, 202 P.3d 1226, 1242 (2009)
(citing Beneficial Hawai#i, Inc. v. Casey, 98 Hawai#i 159, 164, 45
P.3d 359, 364 (2002)).
"An appellate court reviews a circuit court's
determination of an HRCP Rule 60 motion for an abuse of
discretion."  Buscher v. Boning, 114 Hawai# i 202, 211, 159 P.3d
814, 823 (2007) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
We review the circuit court's acceptance/denial of a
judgment debtor's alternative security in lieu of a supersedeas
bond in order to obtain a stay upon appeal for abuse of
discretion.  Shanghai Inv. Co., Inc. v. Alteka Co., Ltd., 92
Hawai#i 482, 504, 993 P.2d 516, 538 (2000), overruled on other
grounds by Blair v. Ing, 96 Hawai# i 327, 31 P.3d 184 (2001); cf
Midkiff v. de Bisschop, 58 Haw. 546, 550, 574 P.2d 128, 131
(1978) (per curiam) ("The determination of the amount of a
supersedeas bond which will be sufficient to protect the rights
of an appellee is committed to the sound discretion of the
circuit court, but this discretion is not unlimited.").
4(a)(3).  Thus, we characterize this appeal as one from the April 20, 2015 Order
Granting Motion to Correct.  Nonetheless, HRAP Rule 3(c)(2) provides that "[a]n
appeal shall not be dismissed for informality of form or title of the notice of
appeal."  The Schmidts' appeal from the April 20, 2015 Order Granting Motion to
Correct "shall be deemed to appeal the disposition of all post judgment motions
that are timely filed after entry of the judgment or order."  HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). 
Accordingly, we also have appellate jurisdiction to review the July 8, 2015 Order
Denying Motion to Vacate.

IV.  DISCUSSION
A. The circuit court did not err in denying the Motion to
Vacate but erred in failing to adequately resolve the
Schmidts' request to enter a satisfaction of judgments .
The Schmidts argue that the circuit court erred in
denying their Motion to Vacate, through which they sought to
vacate the Order Granting Motion to Correct.  Thus, the question
before us is whether the circuit court erred in declining to
vacate its correction of an alleged error in the Order Granting
Motion to Extend.
On appeal, the Schmidts mainly reiterate their
arguments that the Judgment on Special Verdict and the
Supplemental Judgment have already been paid and that Turlington
is not the real party-in-interest to this matter.  The Schmidts
contend that these arguments render erroneous the circuit court's
denial of the Motion to Vacate.  These arguments, however,
challenge the merits of the underlying Order Granting Motion to
Extend, which this court has already affirmed in a previous
appeal by the Schmidts.  See Rapp v. Schmidt, No. 27883, 2008 WL
4001189 (Haw. App. Aug. 29, 2008) (SDO).  To the extent that the
Schmidts' arguments relate to the Order Granting Motion to
Extend, such challenges are barred by the doctrine of res
judicata and we decline to address these arguments.  E. Sav.
Bank, FSB v. Esteban, 129 Hawai# i 154, 158, 296 P.3d 1062, 1066
(2013) ("Res judicata . . . limit[s] a litigant to one
opportunity to litigate aspects of the case to prevent
inconsistent results and multiplicity of suits and to promote
finality and judicial economy." (citing Dorrance v. Lee, 90
Hawai#i 143, 148-49, 976 P.2d 904, 909-10 (1999)).
To the extent that the Motion to Vacate also included a
request for a satisfaction of judgments, the circuit court did
not adequately explain its reasoning for denying the request.  At
the beginning of the hearing on the Motion to Vacate, the circuit
court stated its inclination as follows:
7NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Let me state that the title of the motion, the motion
actually doesn't even correctly state the order that it
purports to vacate.  It's an April 20, 2015 order granting
motion to correct clerical error, and I think that that
distinction and the accurate title of the actual order that
this current motion is moving to vacate, that that
distinction is very important, and that correction needs to
be made very clear for the record.
And so my inclination is, for the reasons set forth in
the opposition and also just because the order that was
issued on April 20th was to correct clerical error.  It was
not as to the underlying judgment, and what this motion to
vacate seeks to do is to vacate the underlying judgment,
which in this Court's view appears to be procedurally and
substantively improper and untimely.
At the conclusion of the hearing, the circuit court ruled: "I am
going to incorporate the grounds stated in the Court's
inclination and for the reasons set forth in the opposition, and
the Court is going to respectfully deny the motion.  I am not
going to order mediation."  The circuit court summarily denied
the entire motion, which consisted of both a motion to vacate and
a motion for entry of a satisfaction of judgments.  The circuit
court gave clear reasoning for declining to vacate the Order
Granting Motion to Correct but did not articulate its position on
the request for a satisfaction of judgments.  The only extent to
which the circuit court addressed the satisfaction of judgments
was by referencing the reasons set forth in Turlington's
opposition.  Given the complex nature of the factual history of
this case and the parties' inability to resolve the issue among
themselves, the circuit court should consider and evaluate any
evidence proffered by each party.  We therefore remand this
matter to the circuit court to conduct an evidentiary hearing to
resolve the issue of whether the Rapp Judgments have been
satisfied.
B. The circuit court did not err in granting the Motion to
Correct because no substantive change was made.
The Schmidts argue that the modification that
Turlington sought to make to the Order Granting Motion to Extend
was substantive in nature rather than a correction of a clerical
mistake.  The Schmidts thus argue that Turlington's Motion to
8NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Correct should have been construed as an HRCP Rule 60(b)(1)
motion for relief from a mistake rather than an HRCP Rule 60(a)
motion to correct a clerical mistake.  Accordingly, the Schmidts
argue, the Motion to Correct was untimely as it was not brought
within a year after the Order Granting Motion to Extend was
entered, as required by HRCP Rule 60(b).98
The Hawai#i Supreme Court has stated:
Relief is not appropriate under Rule 60(a) "when the change
is substantive in nature."  Wright and Miller, Federal
Practice and Procedure § 2854.  "A motion under Rule 60(a)
. . . cannot be used to make the judgment or order say
something other than what was originally pronounced."  Id.
(emphasis added); see also Davis v. Wholesale Motors, 86
Hawai#i 405, 416, 949 P.2d 1026, 1037 (App. 1997) (allowing
modification of a judgment under HRCP Rule 60 because "the
amended judgment did not make any substantive changes to the
original judgment.").  Consequently, "Rule 60(a) is not a
vehicle for relitigating matters that already have been
litigated and decided, nor to change what has been
deliberately done."  Id. (emphasis added); see also Donnelly
v. Donnelly, 98 Hawai #i 280, 286, 47 P.3d 747, 753 (App.
2002) ("HFCR Rule 60(a) applies 'to situations in which a
judgment clearly misrepresents what the court meant to
state.'") (quoting 2 James Wm. Moore, Moore's Federal
Practice § 60.11[1][c] (3d ed.)).
Thomas-Yukimura v. Yukimura, 130 Hawai# i 1, 7-8, 304 P.3d 1182,
1188-89 (2013) (footnote and brackets omitted).
8HRCP Rule 60(b)(1) provides:
(b) Mistakes; inadvertence; excusable neglect; newly
discovered evidence; fraud, etc.   On motion and upon such
terms as  are  just, the  court may relieve a party or a
party's legal representative from a final judgment, order, or
proceeding for the following reasons: (1) mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect[.]
9HRCP Rule 60(a) provides:
(a) Clerical mistakes.   Clerical mistakes in judgments,
orders or other parts of the record and errors therein arising
from oversight or omission may be corrected by the court at
any time of its own initiative or on the motion of any party
and after such notice, if any, as the court orders.  During
the pendency of an appeal, such mistakes may be so corrected
before the appeal is docketed, and thereafter while the appeal
is pending may be so corrected with leave of the appellate
court.

HRS § 657-5 provides:
§657-5  Domestic judgments and decrees.   Unless an
extension is granted, every judgment and decree of any court
of the State shall be presumed to be paid and discharged at
the expiration of ten years after the judgment or decree was
rendered.  No action shall be commenced after the expiration
of ten years from the date a judgment or decree was rendered
or extended.  No extension of a judgment or decree shall be
granted unless the extension is sought within ten years of
the date the original judgment or decree was rendered.  A
court shall not extend any judgment or decree beyond twenty
years from the date of the original judgment or decree.  No
extension shall be granted without notice and the filing of
a non-hearing motion or a hearing motion to extend the life
of the judgment or decree.
HRS § 657-5 provides a ten year interval for a judgment creditor
to attempt collection of the judgment.  If the judgment is not
satisfied within ten years, and a timely extension is sought, the
judgment creditor may extend or renew the judgment for an
additional ten year term -- i.e., the judgment may be extended
for another ten year term following the expiration of the first
ten years from the date the judgment was entered.
Here, the purpose of Turlington's Motion to Extend was
to request that the Judgment on Special Verdict and Supplemental
Judgment be "renewed and extended for an additional ten years as
expressly authorized by H.R.S. § 657-5[.]"  Thus, Turlington was
clearly requesting an extension of the Rapp Judgments for an
additional ten year term following the expiration of the first
ten years from the date the Rapp Judgments were entered.  The
circuit court's Order Granting Motion to Extend cited HRS § 657-5
and provided that the Rapp Judgments were "extended" for an
additional ten years from the date the Rapp Judgments were
entered.  Although the Order Granting Motion to Extend captured
the circuit court's intent to extend the Rapp Judgments,
Turlington's requested corrections provided a helpful
clarification.  Accordingly, because the modifications were not
substantive in nature, Turlington's Motion to Correct was
properly brought as a timely HRCP Rule 60(a) motion to correct a
10NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
clerical error  and the circuit court did not err in granting
the motion to correct and clarify the dates from which the Rapp
Judgments were being extended.10
C. The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying
the Schmidts' request to stay execution of the Rapp
Judgments.
The Schmidts contend that the circuit court erred in
declining the Schmidts' request to use the Moloka #i Properties as
alternative security in lieu of a supersedeas bond in order to
stay execution of the Rapp Judgments and also erred in allowing
Turlington to proceed with the sale of the Moloka#i Properties.11
Pursuant to HRS § 641-3(d) (2016)  and HRCP Rule
62(d), a party appealing a judgment may obtain a stay of its1312
10To the extent the Schmidts also assert that the clerical error was
committed by Turlington's counsel in drafting the order, this does not preclude
relief under HRCP Rule 60(a).  "The mistake correctable under [Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure 60(a)] need not be committed by the clerk or the court; the rule
may be utilized to correct mistakes by the parties as well."  11 Charles Alan
Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure § 2854, at 301 (3d ed. 2012).
11We note that no sale of the Moloka#i Properties occurred prior to the
filing of this appeal.  At the July 13, 2015 hearing on the Motion to Stay, the
circuit court rejected the Schmidts' request to stay the execution on the Rapp
Judgments but instructed Turlington to postpone the sale of the Moloka#i
properties until July 31, 2015.  The Notice of Appeal was filed July 21, 2015.
Based on the record, on July 30, 2015, Thomas F. Schmidt filed a notice of
bankruptcy and automatic stay, effectively preventing the sale of the Moloka#i
Properties scheduled for July 31, 2015.  On February 17, 2016, the Schmidts
notified this court that Thomas F. Schmidt's bankruptcy case had been dismissed
and the automatic stay lifted.  It is unclear from the record whether Turlington
conducted a sale of the Moloka#i Properties subsequent to the termination of the
bankruptcy stay. 
12HRS §641-3(d) provides:
[§641-3]  Stay of proceedings to enforce a judgment.

(d)  When an appeal is taken the appellant by giving a
supersedeas bond may obtain a stay.  The bond may be given at
or after the time of filing the notice of appeal or of
procuring the order allowing the appeal, as the case may be. 
The stay is effective when the supersedeas bond is approved by
the court.
13HRCP Rule 62(d) provides:
(d) Stay Upon Appeal.   When an appeal is taken the
appellant by giving a supersedeas bond may obtain a stay

rule.  The bond may be given at or after the time of filing

enforcement upon posting a supersedeas bond approved by the trial
court.  A judgment debtor may provide alternative security in
lieu of a supersedeas bond.  Shanghai Inv. Co., Inc., 92 Hawai# i
at 503-04, 993 P.2d at 537-38.  "The burden to provide a secure
alternative rests on the judgment debtor."  Id. at 503, 993 P.2d
at 537 (citing Poplar Grove Planting & Ref. Co., Inc. v. Bache
Halsey Stuart, Inc., 600 F.2d 1189, 1191 (5th Cir. 1979)).  In
that respect, the Hawai# i Supreme Court has adopted the approach
taken by the Fifth Circuit in Poplar Grove:
if a judgment debtor objectively demonstrates a present
financial ability to facilely respond to a money judgment
and presents to the court a financially secure plan for
maintaining that same degree of solvency during the period
of an appeal, the court may then exercise a discretion to
substitute some form of guaranty of judgment responsibility
for the usual supersedeas bond.  Contrariwise, if the
judgment debtor's present financial condition is such that
the posting of a full bond would impose an undue financial
burden, the court similarly is free to exercise a discretion
to fashion some other arrangement for substitute security
through an appropriate restraint on the judgment debtor's
financial dealings, which would furnish equal protection to
the judgment creditor.
Id. at 503-04, 993 P.2d at 537-38 (brackets omitted) (quoting
Poplar Grove, 600 F.2d at 1191 (citations omitted)).
In Shanghai Investment Company, Inc., the supreme court
held that trial courts have the discretion to accept alternative
security in lieu of a security bond to stay proceedings pending
appeal.  Id. at 504, 993 P.2d at 538.  In that case, the
alternative security was a judgment lien on real property with a
tax-assessed value of $15 million (approximately three times the
value of the judgment) and $100,000 in a court-supervised
interest-bearing account.  Id.  The supreme court held that, with
this alternative security, the judgment debtor "demonstrated that
it had the financial strength to proficiently respond to a money
judgment and that the same financial strength and ability to
respond will remain undiluted during appeal," and affirmed the
the notice of appeal or of procuring the order allowing the
appeal, as the case may be.  The stay is effective when the
supersedeas bond is approved by the court.
12NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
trial court's allowance of the alternative security.  Id.
(quotation marks and brackets omitted).
In this case, the Schmidts sought to use the Moloka#i
Properties as alternative security in lieu of a supersedeas bond. 
The Moloka #i Properties had a total tax-assessed value of
$459,000.  The Schmidts argued, without any supporting evidence,
that the properties were worth "at least $600,000" and should
serve as adequate security.  In opposition to the Motion to Stay,
Turlington asserted that at the time, the outstanding balance on
the Rapp Judgments was approximately $689,000.  The Schmidts
disagreed with Turlington as to the outstanding balance on the
Rapp Judgments and argued, again without supporting evidence,
that the "actual value of the judgments could not exceed $700,000
to $800,000 while the case is on appeal" and that "in reality
there is nothing due Turlington on the judgments."  The Schmidts
solely relied on the Moloka#i Properties to serve as alternative
security for a supersedeas bond and did not offer any other form
of adequate security.
On this record, we conclude that the Schmidts did not
meet their burden to demonstrate that they had the financial
ability to easily respond to a money judgment and maintain the
same degree of solvency during the period of an appeal.
Accordingly, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in
declining to stay the execution of the Rapp Judgments.

V.  CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the April 20,
2015 Order Granting Motion to Correct in its entirety and the
July 8, 2015 Order Denying Motion to Vacate in part.  We vacate
the portion of the July 8, 2015 Order Denying Motion to Vacate to
