OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
DORIS ANN TABION, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
DAVID LEONARD TABION, Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(FC-D NO. 9221)

 
ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of pro se Plaintiff-Appellant Doris 
Ann Tabion's (Appellant) letter, filed February 25, 2016, which 
the court construes as a motion for reconsideration of the December 18, 2015 order dismissing the appeal pursuant to Hawai
'i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 30 (Motion), the papers in support, and the record, it appears that: (1) HRAP Rule 40(a) requires a motion for reconsideration to be filed within ten days after filing of the dispositional order, "unless by special leave additional time is granted during such period by a judge or justice of the appellate court involved[;]" (2) a motion for reconsideration of the December 18, 2015 order was due on or before December 28, 2015; and (3) Appellant did not obtain an extension to file a motion for reconsideration before the ten-day
 
deadline expired.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is
 
denied as untimely.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, March 2, 2016.
