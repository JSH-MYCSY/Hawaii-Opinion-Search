APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 15-1-097K)

 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
The State of Hawai 'i (State) appeals from the "Order 
Granting Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Count 1 for Lack of 
Jurisdiction Due to Insufficient Charging Language filed June 30, 2015 Without Prejudice" (Order Granting Motion to Dismiss), filed 
on July 23, 2015, in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit 
(circuit court).

On appeal, the State contends that the circuit court
 
erred when it granted Defendant-Appellee Isaac Jerome Gaub's
 (Gaub) "Motion to Dismiss Count 1 For Lack of Jurisdiction Due to
 
Insufficient Charging Language" (Motion to Dismiss), asserting
 
that Count 1 of the Complaint contained the necessary mens rea
 
and the circuit court had jurisdiction over the case. Count 1 of

 The Honorable Ronald Ibarra presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
the State's Complaint charged Gaub with committing Theft in the
 
Second Degree in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 
§ 708-830(7) (2014) and HRS § 708-831(1)(b) (2014) and/or HRS
 
§ 708-830(1) (2014) and HRS § 708-831(1)(b).2
 
For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the circuit
 
court's dismissal of the case without prejudice.
I. Background
 
The State contends that the circuit court erred when it
 
granted Gaub's Motion to Dismiss because Count 1 of the Complaint
 contained the necessary mens rea to adequately charge Gaub with
 Theft in the Second Degree. 
Count 1 of the Complaint states:
 
On or about the 6th day of April, 2015, in South
Kohala, County and State of Hawaii, ISAAC JEROME GAUB
intentionally received, retained, or disposed of the
property of another, TIRE(S) belonging to LEX BRODIE TIRE
AND SERVICE, knowing that it had been stolen, with intent to
 deprive the owner of the property, and the value of said
property exceeded $300.00 and/or obtained or exerted
unauthorized control over the property of another, TIRES(S)
belonging to LEX BRODIE TIRE AND SERVICE the value of which
exceeded $300.00 with intent to deprive the owner of the
property thereby committing the offense of Theft in the
Second Degree, in violation of Section 708-830(7) and 708­831(1)(b) and or 708-830(1) and 708-831(1)(b), Hawaii
Revised Statutes, as amended.
 
(Emphasis added). 
In granting the Motion to Dismiss, the circuit court
 
determined, in pertinent part, that:
 
2.	 The charge of Theft in the Second Degree in Count 1 of
the Complaint is defective because it fails to allege
the state of mind as to each element of the offense of
 Theft in the Second Degree.
3.	 The charge alleges the mens rea of "intent to
deprive," and this mens rea does not extend to all of
the elements of the offense of Theft in the Second
 Degree.
4.	 Specifically, the State has failed to allege a state
of mind with respect to the valuation element of Theft
in the Second Degree, as the State has failed to
allege that the Defendant intended to steal the

 The State's Complaint was filed on April 9, 2015, in the District
Court of the Third Circuit, South Kona Division, but the case was transferred
to circuit court on April 14, 2015. The Complaint charged eighteen counts
against Gaub. However, on July 8, 2015, the State filed a "Motion for Nolle
Prosequi with Prejudice as [to] Counts 2-18 of [the] Complaint," which was
granted, and thus only proceeded with Count 1.
 
2
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
statutorily defined value, in this case $300.00, of
the alleged property or to allege that the Defendant
knew that the property's value was at least $300.00.
5.	 The charge of Theft in the Second Degree in Count 1 of
the Complaint is therefore defective because it fails
to state an offense and fails to give the Defendant
adequate notice as to the state of mind required for
the offense.
 
The circuit court thus granted Gaub's Motion to Dismiss "without
 
prejudice."
 
II. Discussion
 
As noted above, Gaub was charged with Theft in the
 
3
Second Degree pursuant to HRS § 708-831(1)(b)  –- which at the
time of this case applied when there was theft of "property or
 services the value of which exceeds $300" -- and based on
 alternative types of "theft" under HRS § 708-830(1) and (7). The
 pertinent sections of HRS § 708-830 provide:
 
§708-830 Theft.  A person commits theft if the person does
any of the following:
(1)	 Obtains or exerts unauthorized control over property.
A person obtains or exerts unauthorized control over
the property of another with intent
 to deprive the
other of the property.
. . . . 
(7)
	 Receiving stolen property. A person intentionally
receives, retains, or disposes of the property of
another, knowing that it has been stolen, with intent
 
to deprive the owner of the property. It is prima
facie evidence that a person knows the property to
have been stolen if, being a dealer in property of the
sort received, the person acquires the property for a
consideration that the person knows is far below its
reasonable value.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
"Where the statute sets forth with reasonable clarity
 
all essential elements of the crime intended to be punished, and
 
fully defines the offense in unmistakable terms readily
 comprehensible to persons of common understanding, a charge drawn

 At the time the Complaint was filed in this case, §708-831(1)(b)
stated in pertinent part:
 
§708-831 Theft in the second degree.  (1) A person
commits the offense of theft in the second degree if the
person commits theft:
. . .
 (b)	 Of property or services the value of which
exceeds $300[.]
 
3

in the language of the statute is sufficient." State v.
 
Jendrusch, 58 Haw. 279, 282, 567 P.2d 1242, 1245 (1977). Under
 
HRS § 702-205 (2014), "the essential elements of an offense are
 (1) conduct; (2) attendant circumstances; and (3) results of conduct." State v. Mita, 124 Hawai
'i 385, 391, 245 P.3d 458, 464 
(2010). 
Decisions by the Hawai 'i Supreme Court, however, have 
determined that a charge must also appropriately set out the applicable mens rea to satisfy due process concerns. In State v. Nesmith, 127 Hawai
'i 48, 53, 276 P.3d 617, 622 (2012), the 
supreme court noted that "[i]n some cases, however, a charge tracking the language of the statute defining the offense nevertheless violates an accused's due process rights." Though not an element of the offense, states of mind or mens rea are "required to be included in the charges against the defendants in order 'to alert the defendants of precisely what they needed to defend against to avoid a conviction.'" State v. Gonzalez, 128 
Hawai
'i 314, 324, 288 P.3d 788, 798 (2012) (quoting Nesmith, 127 
Hawai'i at 56, 276 P.3d at 625). Further, "[a] charge that fails 
to charge a requisite state of mind cannot be construed reasonably to state an offense and thus the charge is dismissed without prejudice because it violates due process." State v. 
Apollonio, 130 Hawai
'i 353, 359, 311 P.3d 676, 682 (2013) 
(footnote omitted).
A. Mens Rea Related to the Value of the Property
 
With regard to theft statutes, prior decisions by this 
court and the Hawai 'i Supreme Court support the circuit court's 
ruling in this case that the mens rea of intent applies to the attendant circumstance regarding the value of the property involved in the theft. See State v. Cabrera, 90 Hawai
'i 359, 978 
P.2d 797 (1999); State v. Mitchell, 88 Hawai 'i 216, 965 P.2d 149 
(App. 1998). Although both Cabrera and Mitchell addressed whether jury instructions were appropriate, both cases held that the mens rea of intent applied with regard to the value of the 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
property involved in the respective case.
 
Starting with the earlier case, Mitchell addressed the
 
mens rea for the valuation element of Theft in the Second Degree
 
associated with a charge based on HRS § 708-831(1)(b) and HRS
 § 708-830(1), which is similar to one part of the charge against
 Gaub in this case. In Mitchell, this court held that "[p]ursuant
 
4
to HRS § 702-207 (1993),  the state of mind of 'intent' applies
to each material element of the offense." 88 Hawai 'i at 222, 965 
P.2d at 155. This court concluded: 
"[t]he material elements of theft in the second degree are,
therefore, that the defendant intended to: (1) obtain or
exert unauthorized control over the property of another, HRS
§ 708-830(1); (2) deprive the other of his or her property,
id.; and (3) deprive another of property that exceeds $300
in value (valuation element). HRS § 708-831(1)(b)."
 
Id. This court also stated that "[i]n regards to the third,
 
valuation element, the defendant's state of mind is critical"
 
because "the defendant's state of mind with regard to the value
 of the property determines the grade of the offense, and thus
 also determines the sentencing that will be imposed upon him or
 her." Id. at 222-23, 965 P.2d at 155-56. 
Subsequently, in Cabrera, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court 
addressed the applicable mens rea for the valuation element of Theft in the Second Degree associated with a charge under HRS § 708-831(1)(b) and the type of theft set out in HRS § 708­830(8)(a) (2014).
5 See 90 Hawai 'i at 360 n.1, 978 P.2d at 798 
n.1. As part of its analysis, the supreme court adopted the 
analysis from Mitchell. 90 Hawai 'i at 366-67, 978 P.2d at 804­
05. Moreover, the supreme court stated that
 
the legislative history specific to HRS ch. 708, pt. IV,
entitled "Theft and Related Offenses," appears to be silent
 
4
 HRS § 702-207 provides: "[w]hen the definition of an offense
specifies the state of mind sufficient for the commission of that offense,
without distinguishing among the elements thereof, the specified state of mind
shall apply to all elements of the offense, unless a contrary purpose plainly
appears."
5
 HRS § 708-830(8)(a) addresses Shoplifting and provides: "[a] a person
conceals or takes possession of the goods or merchandise of any store or
retail establishment, with the intent to defraud."
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
as to what state of mind the legislature intended to require
with regard to the valuation element of the offense of
theft. However, a reading of HRS §§ 708-830(8)(a) and 708­831(1)(b) in pari materia . . . with HRS §§ 708-801(4) and
(5) (1993 and Supp. 1998), against the back drop of HRS §§
702-204, 702-205, and 702-206 (1993), sheds some light on
the subject. 
  
Id. at 368, 978 P.2d at 806. The supreme court further stated
 
that pursuant to HRS § 702-205, the property value requirement
 for Theft in the Second Degree ($300) 
for purposes of HRS § 708-831(1)(b) . . . is an attendant
circumstance of the conduct—i.e., the concealment or taking
possession of the goods or merchandise of any store or
retail establishment—proscribed by HRS § 708-830(8)(a) . . .
put differently, 'value' in excess of $300.00 is the
'attendant circumstance element' of the second degree theft
offense, within the meaning of HRS § 702-205.
 
6
Id. 	The supreme court further addressed HRS § 702-204,  HRS
7	 8 
§ 708-801(4) and (5),  and HRS § 702-206(1)(b).  Id. at 368-69, 
 
6 HRS § 702-204 (2014) provides:
 
§702-204 State of mind required.  Except as provided in
section 702-212, a person is not guilty of an offense unless
the person acted intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, or
negligently, as the law specifies, with respect to each
element of the offense. When the state of mind required to
establish an element of an offense is not specified by the
law, that element is established if, with respect thereto, a
person acts intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly.
7 HRS § 708-801(4) and (5) (2014) provide:
 
§708-801 Valuation of property or services.  Whenever the
 
value of property or services is determinative of the class
or grade of an offense, or otherwise relevant to a
prosecution, the following shall apply:
 
. . . . 
(4)	 When acting intentionally or knowingly with respect to
the value of property or services is required to
establish an element of an offense, the value of
property or services shall be prima facie evidence
that the defendant believed or knew the property or
services to be of that value. When acting recklessly
with respect to the value of property or services is
sufficient to establish an element of an offense, the
value of the property or services shall be prima facie
evidence that the defendant acted in reckless
 disregard of the value.
(5)	 When acting intentionally or knowingly with respect to
the value of property or services is required to
establish an element of an offense, it is a defense,
(continued...)

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
978 P.2d at 806-07. Based on all the above provisions, the
 
supreme court concluded,
 
insofar as HRS § 708–830(8)(a) expressly recites that
"intent to defraud" (emphasis added) is the state of mind
requisite to the commission of theft by "shoplifting," and
in light of HRS § 702–207, which provides in relevant part
that "the specified state of mind shall apply to all
elements of the offense, unless a contrary purpose plainly
appears, . . . it would follow, in any event, that the
"intentional" state of mind attaches to all of the elements
 of the offense, including the attendant circumstance of the
value of the property taken. This is precisely the
conclusion that the Mitchell court reached with respect to
second degree theft, in violation of HRS §§ 708–830(1) and
708–831(1)(b).
 
Id. at 369, 978 P.2d at 807. Thus, the supreme court held that
 
"in order to convict a defendant of theft in the second degree,
 
in violation of HRS §§ 708-830(8)(a) and 708-831(1)(b), the
 prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused
 intended to steal property or services valued in excess of
 $300.00." Id.
 
As explicitly decided in 
Mitchell,  the offense charged
 
against Gaub in this case based on HRS §§ 708-831(1)(b) and 708­830(1) requires establishing, inter alia, that Gaub had an
 intentional state of mind regarding the value of the property
 being in excess of $300. Given this requirement, and in light of
 the Hawai
'i Supreme Court cases related to the inclusion of 
applicable mens rea in charging documents, the charge against
 Gaub must have reflected the mens rea of intent related to the
 value of the property involved in the alleged theft. 
7(...continued)
which reduces the class or grade of the offense to a

class or grade of offense consistent with the
defendant's state of mind, that the defendant believed
that valuation of the property or services to be less.
When acting recklessly with respect to the value of
the property or services is required to establish an
element of an offense, it is a defense that the
defendant did not recklessly disregard a risk that the
property was of the specified value.
8
 HRS § 702-206(1)(b) (2014) provides: "[a] person acts intentionally
with respect to attendant circumstances when he is aware of the existence of
such circumstances or believes or hopes that they exist."
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
We come to the same conclusion with respect to the
 
alternative charge against Gaub based on HRS §§ 708-831(1)(b) and
 
708-830(7). We recognize that HRS § 708-830(1), discussed in
 Mitchell, and HRS § 708-830(8)(a), discussed in Cabrera, only
 contain a single mens rea of intent, whereas the language of HRS
 § 708-830(7) contains both intentional and knowing mens rea. 
However, based on the reasoning in Mitchell and Cabrera, as well
 as the language of HRS § 708-830(7), we believe it logically
 follows that the intentional state of mind also attaches to the
 valuation element for a charge based on HRS §§ 708-831(1)(b) and
 708-830(7). 
HRS § 708-830(7) states in pertinent part that "[a] 
person intentionally receives, retains, or disposes of the property of another, knowing that it has been stolen, with the intent to deprive the owner of the property." (Emphasis added.) As previously discussed, HRS § 708-831(1)(b) provided at the time relevant to this case that theft constitutes Theft in the Second Degree when the property or services involved has a value which exceeds $300. In Cabrera, the supreme court determined that the valuation element based on HRS § 708-831(1)(b) was an attendant circumstance to the type of theft set out under HRS § 708­830(8)(a) ("[a] person conceals or takes possession of the goods or merchandise of any store or retail establishment, with intent to defraud")(emphasis added), and that the mens rea of intent applied to that valuation element. Cabrera, 90 Hawai
'i at 368, 
978 P.2d at 806. We see no basis to differentiate for a charge under HRS §§ 708-831(1)(b) and 708-830(7), as in this case. The conduct establishing "theft" under HRS §708-830(7) primarily involves intentional conduct, along with knowing the property is stolen. Consistent with Mitchell and Cabrera, we conclude that the mens rea associated with the valuation element of Theft in the Second Degree based on a charge under HRS §§ 708-831(1)(b) 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
and 708-830(7) is intent.9
 
In this case, the Complaint first alleges that Gaub
 
"intentionally received, retained, or disposed of the property of
 
another, TIRE(S) belonging to LEX BRODIE TIRE AND SERVICE,
 knowing that it had been stolen, with intent to deprive the owner
 of the property, and the value of said property exceeded
 $300.00." (Emphasis added.) This language, which seeks to
 charge under HRS §§ 708-831(1)(b) and 708-830(7), cannot
 reasonably be read such that Gaub was put on notice that he
 committed the alleged conduct with the intent that the value of
 the property exceeded $300.
 
Likewise, the second part of the charge reads that Gaub
 
"obtained or exerted unauthorized control over the property of
 another, TIRE(S) belonging to LEX BRODIE TIRE AND SERVICE the
 value of which exceeded $300.00 with intent to deprive the owner
 of the property." (Emphasis added.) This portion of the charge,
 which seeks to charge under HRS §§ 708-831(1)(b) and 708-830(1),
 again cannot reasonably be read such that Gaub was put on notice
 that he committed the alleged conduct with the intent that the
 value of the property exceeded $300.
 
Because the Complaint cannot reasonably be read to
 
allege that the mens rea of intent attaches to the valuation
 element for each of the alternate grounds for the charge, Gaub
 was not alerted "of precisely what [he] needed to defend against
 
9 We note that, under HRS § 702-206 (2015), acting "intentionally" and
"knowingly" with respect to attendant circumstances is somewhat similar. HRS
 
§ 702-206 provides, in relevant part:
 
§702-206 Definitions of states of mind.
 (1) 
“Intentionally.”

. . . 
 
(b)
	 A person acts intentionally with respect to attendant
circumstances when he is aware of the existence of
 such circumstances or believes or hopes that they
exist.
 
. . .
 (2) 
“Knowingly.”

. . . 
 
(b)
	 A person acts knowingly with respect to attendant
circumstances when he is aware that such circumstances
 exist.

to avoid a conviction." See Gonzalez, 128 Hawai 'i at 324, 288 
P.3d at 798 (citation omitted). The circuit court did not err in 
granting Gaub's Motion to Dismiss on these grounds.
B. 	Mens rea for "obtains or exerts
 unauthorized control over property"
 
The State also challenges the circuit court's granting
 
of the Motion to Dismiss because it contends the Complaint
 sufficiently alleged the mens rea as to the portion of the charge
 stating that Gaub "obtained or exerted unauthorized control over
 the property of another," which is based on HRS § 708-830(1). 
HRS § 708-830(1) provides that a person commits theft
 
when "[a] person obtains or exerts unauthorized control over the
 property of another with intent to deprive the other of the
 property." Thus, the statute does not expressly provide a mens
 rea before the language "obtains or exerts unauthorized control
 over the property of another." However, as held in Mitchell, 
[t]he material elements of theft in the second degree are,
therefore, that the defendant intended to: (1) obtain or
exert unauthorized control over the property of another, HRS
§ 708-830(1); (2) deprive the other of his or her property,
id.; and (3) deprive another of property that exceeds $300
in value (valuation element). HRS § 708-831(1)(b).
 
Mitchell, 88 Hawai 'i at 222, 965 P.2d at 155. Thus, under 
Mitchell, the mens rea of intent also attaches to obtaining or 
exerting unauthorized control over the property of another. 
Here, the relevant portion of the charge under HRS 
§ 708-830(1) tracks the language of the statute and does not specify the mens rea of intent before the conduct of obtaining or exerting unauthorized control. Given the requirements under Mitchell, the charge does not sufficiently inform Gaub that he must have had the intent to obtain or exert unauthorized control over the tires and he was not alerted of what he needed to defend against to avoid a conviction. See Gonzalez, 128 Hawai
'i at 324, 
288 P.3d at 798. 
C. Jurisdiction
 
The State contends that the circuit court erred to the
 
extent its grant of the Motion to Dismiss indicated a lack of
 jurisdiction. It does not appear, however, that the circuit
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
court determined that it lacked jurisdiction based on the 
deficient charge. It appears that the confusion arises because Gaub's motion was titled "Motion to Dismiss Counts 1 for Lack of Jurisdiction Due to Insufficient Charging Language." In any event, on appeal, both parties agree that the issue of jurisdiction was settled in State v. Schwartz, 136 Hawai
'i 258, 
361 P.3d 1161 (2015), which concluded that "[s]ubject matter jurisdiction is not abrogated by a charging instrument that fails to allege a culpable state of mind or a statutory element defining the offense[.]" 136 Hawai
'i at 263-72, 282, 361 P.3d at 
1165-75, 1185. 
Thus, the circuit court's jurisdiction was not
 
compromised because of its determination that the Complaint was
 deficient.
 
III. Conclusion
 
Based on the above, the Order Granting Motion to
 
Dismiss filed on July 23, 2015, by the Circuit Court of the Third
 Circuit, which dismissed Count I without prejudice, is affirmed.
