OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
YOSHIRO SANNEY, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CRIMINAL NO. 10-1-1570)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Yoshiro Sanney (Sanney) appeals
 
from the June 29, 2015 "Order Denying [Sanney's] Motion to
 
Reconsider Sentence" entered in the Circuit Court of the First
 
1
Circuit  (circuit court). This post-judgment order denied 
Sanney's post-judgment Hawai 'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) 
Rule 35 motion for reconsideration of sentence in the September 26, 2011 "Judgment of Conviction and Sentence" against Sanney for one count of sexual assault in the second degree in violation of HRS § 707-731(1)(b) (2014 Repl.) and one count of attempted sexual assault in the second degree in violation of HRS § 707-731(1)(b) and HRS § 705-500 (2014 Repl.). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs

 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as

 The Honorable Karen S.S. Ahn presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude Sanney's
 
appeal is without merit.
 
On September 22, 2010, Plaintiff-Appellee State of 
Hawai'i (State) obtained an indictment against Sanney for one 
count of sexual assault in the second degree in violation of HRS § 707-731(1)(b) and one count of attempted sexual assault in the second degree in violation of HRS § 707-731(1)(b) and HRS § 705-500. 
Sanney pleaded no contest to both counts.
 On September 26, 2011, the circuit court entered a
 
"Judgment of Conviction and Sentence" against Sanney and
 sentenced him to imprisonment for two concurrent terms of ten
 years.
 
On December 22, 2011, Sanney filed a "Motion To
 
Reconsider Sentence" (Motion for Reconsideration) pursuant to
 
HRPP Rule 35. On June 21, 2012, the circuit court entered an
 
"Order Summarily Denying [Sanney's] Motion To Reconsider
 Sentence" (2012 Order Denying Reconsideration)
 
On July 24, 2012, Sanney filed a notice of appeal, in
 
case no. CAAP-12-0000654, from the 2012 Order Denying
 Reconsideration.
 
On July 8, 2013, this court entered a summary 
disposition order in case no. CAAP-12-0000654 affirming the 2012 Order Denying Reconsideration. On September 19, 2013, Sanney applied to the Hawai
'i Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari in 
case no. SCWC-12-0000654. 
On August 12, 2014, the supreme court entered a
 
memorandum opinion that vacated this court's summary disposition
 order and the circuit court's 2012 Order Denying Reconsideration
 and remanded this case to the circuit court with instructions to
 hold a hearing on Sanney's Motion for Reconsideration.
 
On January 20, 2015, a hearing on Sanney's Motion for
 
Reconsideration was held, and at the conclusion of the hearing
 the circuit court denied the motion (2015 Denial). No written
 
order was entered on this date.

On February 19, 2015, Sanney filed a notice of appeal
 
from the 2015 Denial in case no. CAAP-15-0000086.
 
On March 30, 2015, the circuit court clerk filed the
 
record on appeal for case no. CAAP-15-0000086, which did not
 
contain a post-remand written order regarding the remand
 proceedings on Sanney's Motion for Reconsideration.
 
On June 24, 2015, this court entered an order
 
dismissing case no. CAAP-15-0000086 for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction. Sanney filed a motion for reconsideration of the
 dismissal, which this court subsequently denied.
 
On June 29, 2015, the circuit court entered its written
 
"Order Denying [Sanney's Motion For Reconsideration]" (2015 Order
 
Denying Reconsideration).
 
On July 29, 2015, Sanney filed a notice of appeal from
 
the 2015 Order Denying Reconsideration.
 
On appeal, Sanney contends the circuit court abused its
 
discretion in sentencing him to an indeterminate term of 10 years
 
of imprisonment because at the taking of his no contest plea the
 circuit court had given an inclination to sentence him to
 probation subject to up to 18 months of imprisonment. However,
 the circuit court explained:
 
Now, Mr. Sanney, an inclination is not a promise. I
did tell your lawyer that based on what he told me, that
would be the way I would be looking at the case, but I need
to be very up front with you.
 
You know, there's going to be a presentence report
[(PSI)] that's going to be generated if you decide to plead
guilty today. And I don't know much about you, I'm looking
at you now, I know what relatively little the lawyers have
told me about the case and about your background, but it's
that PSI that's very important, because that's going to be a
more in-depth explanation of who you are, and your history,
and your characteristics and the offense.
 
In addition, the [circuit court] would always consider
what happens at the sentencing hearing -- you know, the
arguments; what, if anything, you have to say, and so on.
So based on all of that, that's how the [circuit court] is
going to make its decision on what an appropriate sentence
would be. So I can tell you that's the inclination based on
the representations I have. But as you can imagine, an
inclination is only as good as the representations it is
based on, so you need to understand that.
 
Sanney indicated that he understood and had no questions.

At the sentencing hearing and at the hearing on the
 
Motion for Reconsideration on remand, Sanney denied "raping" the
 
complainant although he admitted that he did not know the
 complainant except by sight before the incident. Sanney
 maintained that the complainant's boyfriend had insinuated that
 the boyfriend and the complainant were in an "open relationship,"
 so Sanney began "making out" with the complainant. Sanney
 believed the "making out" was consensual. Sanney admitted that
 the complainant was passed out when he began having sex with her,
 but maintained that, "I was so messed up that I couldn't stop
 myself at that point." Sanney indicated that he understood that
 a female bystander was taking pictures of the incident and that,
 "to some extent I found it exciting that we were doing something
 we weren't supposed to be doing in public."
 
The State contends Sanney's allocution at sentencing
 
and at the hearing on the Motion for Reconsideration indicated
 that Sanney did not fully recognize his conduct as rape. It also
 indicated that Sanney's substance abuse had reached a stage where
 he was unable to control his sexual conduct in public. The
 circuit court's previous knowledge was that Sanney was in a
 substance abuse program until April of 2010. The instant offense
 occurred five months later, when Sanney was abusing alcohol and
 smoking marijuana.
 
The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in
 
denying Sanney's Motion for Reconsideration and in determining
 that a sentence of probation with 18 months of imprisonment was
 insufficient and that concurrent ten-year terms of imprisonment
 were warranted.
 
A sentencing judge generally has broad discretion in
imposing a sentence. The applicable standard of review for
sentencing or resentencing matters is whether the court
committed plain and manifest abuse of discretion in its
decision. Factors which indicate a plain and manifest abuse
of discretion are arbitrary or capricious action by the
judge and a rigid refusal to consider the defendant's
contentions. And, generally, to constitute an abuse it must
appear that the court clearly exceeded the bounds of reason
or disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the
substantial detriment of a party litigant.
