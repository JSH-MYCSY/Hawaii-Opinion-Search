SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Claimant/Appellant/Appellant Debra Leite-Hulama (Leite-
Hulama) appeals from the "Decision and Order" issued on July 2,
 
2015 by the Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board (LIRAB).
 
On appeal, Leite-Hulama contends that the LIRAB erred
 
when it (1) denied her motion for reconsideration made pursuant
 
to Hawaii Administrative Rules (HAR) § 12-47-53 (effective Nov.
 
1
5, 1981)  and Hawaii Revised Statute (HRS) § 386-87(d) (2015

 HAR § 12-47-53 provides:
 
§12-47-53 Reconsideration or reopening of decision or
 
order.
 (a) In the absence of an appeal and within thirty
days after mailing of a copy of the [LIRAB's] decision or
order, the [LIRAB] may, upon the request of any party, or
upon its own motion, reconsider or reopen the matter. If
reopening is allowed, the [LIRAB] may take further evidence
or may modify its decision or order. The time to initiate

Repl.) to oral depositions ordered by the Director of the
Disability Compensation Division; and (3) determined that the
 
LIRAB had the authority to order independent medical

 
examinations.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
judicial review shall run from the date of mailing of the
further decision if the matter has been reconsidered or
 reopened. If the request for reconsideration or reopening is
denied, the time to initiate judicial review shall run from
the date of mailing the denial decision.
 
(b) The request for reconsideration or reopening shall
be in writing and shall be served upon all parties. The
request shall specify the reasons why reconsideration or
reopening is warranted.
 
(c) A hearing on the request for reconsideration or
reopening may be held at the [LIRAB's] discretion.

 HRS § 386-87(d) provides:
 
§386-87 Appeals to appellate board.
 . . . .
 (d) In the absence of an appeal and within thirty days
after mailing of a certified copy of the appellate board's
decision or order, the appellate board may, upon the
application of the director or any other party, or upon its
own motion, reopen the matter and thereupon may take further
evidence or may modify its findings, conclusions or
decisions. The time to initiate judicial review shall run
from the date of mailing of the further decision if the
matter has been reopened. If the application for reopening
is denied, the time to initiate judicial review shall run
from the date of mailing of the denial decision.

 HRS § 386-86(e) provides:
 
§386-86 Proceedings upon claim; hearings.
 
. . . .

manner and effect prescribed by the Hawaii rules of civil
procedure; provided that when the claimant's deposition is
taken, the employer shall pay for the cost to the claimant
of attending the deposition, any costs associated with
having the deposition transcribed and copied, and any and
all reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred by the
claimant with respect to the deposition.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude Leite­Hulama's appeal is without merit.
 
Leite-Hulama argues that the LIRAB erred in denying her 
April 10, 2015 "Motion to Reconsider Order Denying Motion to Allow Attorney's Fees for Oral Deposition of Claimant Debra Leite-Hulama" (Motion for Reconsideration) based on the standard 
for motions for reconsideration articulated in Ass'n of Home 
Owners of Kai Nui Court ex rel. Bd. of Dirs. v. City & Cty. of Honolulu, 118 Hawai
'i 119, 185 P.3d 867 (App. 2008). LIRAB's 
"Decision and Order" cited to Kai Nui for the proposition that "the purpose of a motion for reconsideration is to allow the parties to present new evidence or arguments that could not have been presented during the earlier adjudicated motion." Kai Nui, 
118 Hawai
'i at 121, 185 P.3d at 869 (quoting Amfac, Inc. v. 
Waikiki Beachcomber Inv. Co., 74 Haw. 85, 114, 839 P.2d 10, 27 (1992)). The LIRAB then concluded: 
Under the standard for motion for reconsideration
 
articulated in Kai Nui, supra, the [LIRAB] concludes that
[Leite-Hulama's] motion for reconsideration is denied,
because [Leite-Hulama] did not present any new evidence and
the arguments advanced in her memorandum in support of her
motion for reconsideration could have and should have been
 presented with her Motion to Allow Attorney Fees for Oral
Deposition.
 
Although Kai Nui is not a workers' compensation case,
 
the standard articulated in Kai Nui is the same standard that
 
this court follows when reviewing motions for reconsideration
 filed pursuant to HAR § 12-47-53 and HRS § 386-87(d). See Yadao
 
v. Dep't of Land & Nat. Res., 137 Hawai
'i 162, 177, 366 P.3d 
1041, 1056 (App. 2016). This court in Yadao recognized that
 
[t]he purpose of a motion for reconsideration is to allow
the parties to present new evidence and/or arguments that
could not have been presented in an earlier adjudicated
motion. Reconsideration is not a device to relitigate old
matters or to raise arguments or evidence that could and
should have been brought during the earlier proceeding.
 
Id. (brackets omitted) (quoting Sousaris v. Miller, 92 Hawai 'i 
505, 513, 993 P.2d 539, 547 (2000)) (summarizing the standard for
 
motions for reconsideration filed pursuant to HAR § 12-47-53 and
 
3
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRS § 386-87(d)). 
Furthermore, Leite-Hulama argues that she presented new 
evidence in her Motion for Reconsideration because she attached 
documents to her motion that she did not include in her original March 12, 2015 "Motion to Allow Attorney Fees for Oral Deposition of Claimant Debra Leite-Hulama" (Motion for Fees and Costs). We 
reiterate the well-established principle that "[r]econsideration 
is not a device to relitigate old matters or to raise arguments or evidence that could and should have been brought during the earlier proceeding." Yadao, 137 Hawai
'i at 177, 366 P.3d at 1056 
(brackets omitted) (quoting Sousaris, 92 Hawai 'i at 513, 993 P.2d 
at 547); see Cho v. State, 115 Hawai 'i 373, 384, 168 P.3d 17, 28 
(2007); First Ins. Co. of Hawai 'i, Ltd. v. Lawrence, 77 Hawai 'i 2, 
17, 881 P.2d 489, 504 (1994); Briggs v. Hotel Corp. of the Pac., Inc., 73 Haw. 276, 287 n.7, 831 P.2d 1335, 1342 n.7 (1992). Leite-Hulama's Motion for Reconsideration presented legal arguments and evidence that she did not include in her original Motion for Fees and Costs or in supplemental filings in support of her motion, even though the arguments and evidence were available to her at the time. 
Because the legal arguments and evidence presented in 
Leite-Hulama's Motion for Reconsideration could have and should have been presented in her Motion for Fees and Costs, the LIRAB did not abuse its discretion in denying Leite-Hulama's Motion for Reconsideration. See Yadao, 137 Hawai
'i at 177, 366 P.3d at 
1056; see also Gossinger v. Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Regency of Ala Wai, 73 Haw. 412, 427, 835 P.2d 627, 635 (1992) (holding that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion when it denied a motion for reconsideration supported by arguments and evidence that "could and should have been presented to the trial court prior to its determination of the [original motion]").
4 
Therefore,
 
4
 Because we hold that Leite-Hulama failed to present new evidence
or arguments in her Motion for Reconsideration that could not have been made
in her Motion for Fees and Costs, we need not address her remaining points of
error on appeal.
