(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
appellate jurisdiction over Plaintiff-Appellant Carol L. 
McKenna's (Appellant McKenna) appeal from the Honorable Melvin H. Fujino's July 2, 2015 "Order Denying Plaintiff's: (1) Motion for Relief from the Order Denying Plaintiff's Evidentiary Hearing, Filed March 17, 2015; (2) Motion for Relief from the Stipulation for Dismissal with Prejudice of All Claims and All Parties, Filed March 24, 2015; and (3) Supplemental Motion for Relief from the Stipulation for Dismissal with Prejudice of All Claims and All Parties, Filed April 28, 2015" (the July 2, 2015 order) because the circuit court has not yet filed an appealable final judgment that resolves all of the claims in this case, as Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2014) and Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) requires for an appeal 
from a civil circuit court case under the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 
1334, 1338 (1994). 
When a party attempts to assert an appeal from a civil 
circuit court case, HRS § 641-1(a) and HRCP Rule 58 require that such an "appeal may be taken from circuit court orders resolving claims against parties only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (emphasis added). 
"Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. 
One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai
'i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008).

Furthermore, "an appeal from any judgment will be dismissed as
 
premature if the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve
 all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary
 for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Jenkins
, 76 Hawai 'i 
at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. When interpreting the requirements for
 a judgment under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i noted 
that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality, . . . and we should not make such searches
necessary by allowing the parties the option of waiving the
requirements of HRCP [Rule] 58.
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (original emphasis). 
"An appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment in 
favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Id. at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 
(footnote omitted). 
After a circuit court has entered an appealable final
 
judgment that resolves all claims, "[a] post-judgment order is an
 appealable final order under HRS § 641-1(a) if the order ends the
 proceedings, leaving nothing further to be accomplished." Ditto
 
v. McCurdy, 103 Hawai
'i 153, 157, 80 P.3d 974, 978 (2003) 
(citation omitted). Although, for the purpose of appealability, a separate judgment is usually necessary under HRCP Rule 58 and the holding in Jenkins, "the separate judgment requirement articulated in Jenkins is inapposite in the post-judgment context." Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 Hawai
'i at 158, 80 P.3d at 979. 
Clearly, the rule in Jenkins – to wit, that circuit court
orders resolving claims against parties must generally be
reduced to a judgment and the judgment must be entered in
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
favor of or against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP
Rule 58 before an appeal may be taken – is limited to
circuit court orders disposing of claims raised in a circuit
court complaint.
 
Id. at 159, 80 P.3d at 980. For example, "[a]n order denying a 
motion for post-judgment relief under HRCP [Rule] 60(b) is an appealable final order under HRS § 641-1(a)." Ditto v. McCurdy, 
103 Hawai
'i at 160, 80 P.3d at 981 (citation omitted). However, 
an appealable final judgment is a prerequisite to any order qualifying as an appealable post-judgment order. For example, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i recently held that, "[a]bsent an 
underlying appealable final judgment, the circuit court's rulings on a purported [HRCP] Rule 60(b) motion are interlocutory and not appealable until entry of such a judgment." Bailey v. 
DuVauchelle, 135 Hawaii 482, 491, 353 P.3d 1024, 1033 (2015) (citations omitted). 
On October 1, 2015, the circuit court clerk filed the
 
record on appeal for appellate court case number CAAP-15-0000554,
 which does not contain an appealable final judgment that resolves
 all claims. Therefore, we lack appellate jurisdiction over
 appellate court case number CAAP-15-0000554.
 
Granted, the circuit court entered a March 24, 2014
 
judgment in favor of Defendants/Cross-Claim Defendants/Cross-
Claim Plaintiffs/Appellees Geoffrey S. Kim (Appellee Kim) and
 Hawaiian Isles Adjusting Co., LLC (Appellee Hawaiian Isles
 Adjusting), and against Appellant McKenna as to Appellant
 McKenna's first amended complaint. However, the March 24, 2014
 judgment is not an appealable final judgment because the
 March 24, 2014 judgment neither resolves all claims against all
 
-4­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
parties nor does it contain an express finding of no just reason 
for delay in the entry of judgment as to one or more but fewer than all claims or parties, as HRCP Rule 54(b) requires for any judgment that does not resolve all claims. 
We note that the circuit court's February 6, 2015 order 
granting Defendants/Cross-Claim Defendants/Cross-Claim Plaintiffs/Appellees Association of Apartment Owners of Elima Lani and Certified Management, Inc.'s November 5, 2014 motion to enforce a settlement agreement was immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine.
1 See, e.g., Cook v. Surety Life 
Insurance, Company, 79 Hawai 'i 403, 408, 903 P.2d 708, 713 (App. 
1995) "[A]n order enforcing a settlement agreement is a collateral order which is appealable."). However, Appellant McKenna did not timely appeal from the February 6, 2015 order under Rule 4(a)(1) of the Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure. 
Nevertheless, "[t]he failure to take an immediate appeal from a collateral order does not preclude review of the order on appeal from a final judgment." Hoopai v. Civil Service Commission, 106 
Hawai
'i 205, 215, 103 P.3d 365, 375 (2004) (citation omitted). 
When and if the circuit court enters an appealable final judgment in this case, then an aggrieved party will be entitled to obtain appellate review of the February 6, 2015 order by way of a timely appeal from the future appealable final judgment. 
We additionally note that some of the parties and the

 "In order to fall within the narrow ambit of the collateral order
 
doctrine, the order must [1] conclusively determine the disputed question,
[2] resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of theaction, and [3] be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment."Siangco v. Kasadate, 77 Hawai' i 157, 161, 883 P.2d 78, 82 (1994) (citations
and internal quotation marks omitted) (original brackets).

Honorable Elizabeth A. Strance entered a May 16, 2015 
"Stipulation for Dismissal with Prejudice of All Claims and All Parties; Order" (the May 16, 2015 dismissal order), which purports to be a voluntary stipulation for dismissal with prejudice of all claims and all parties pursuant to HRCP Rule 41(a)(1)(B). As the language of HRCP Rule 41(a)(1)(B) indicates, a stipulation to dismiss must be "voluntary": 
Rule 41. Dismissal of actions.
 
(a) Voluntary dismissal: Effect thereof.
(1) By plaintiff; by stipulation. An action may
be dismissed by the plaintiff without order of court (A) by
filing a notice of dismissal at any time before the return
date as provided in Rule 12(a) or service by the adverse
party of an answer or of a motion for summary judgment, or
(B) by filing a stipulation of dismissal signed by all
parties who have appeared in the action, in the manner and
form prescribed by Rule 41.1 of these rules. Unless
 otherwise stated in the notice of dismissal or stipulation,
the dismissal is without prejudice, except that a notice of
dismissal operates as an adjudication upon the merits when
filed by a plaintiff who has once dismissed in any court of
the United States, or of any state, territory or insular
possession of the United States an action based on or
including the same claim.
 
(Emphases added). Apparently Appellant McKenna refused to
 
voluntarily sign the March 16, 2015 dismissal order, as evidenced
 by circuit court's having directed the circuit court clerk to
 sign the March 16, 2015 dismissal order on behalf of Appellant
 McKenna. Rule 41(a)(1)(A)(ii) of the Federal Rules of Civil
 Procedure, the federal rule analogous to HRCP Rule 41(a)(1)(B),
 has been construed to require that "[a] stipulation of dismissal
 must be voluntary, and a court may not order a party to execute a
 stipulation of dismissal even if the other party claims that the
 parties agreed to settle the matter." 8 James Wm. Moore et al.,
 Moores Federal Practice § 41.34[2], at 41-112 (3d ed. 2009)
 (footnote omitted). In the instant case, the signature of the
 circuit court clerk on behalf of Appellant McKenna does not
 
-6­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appear to constitute the voluntary signature of Appellant McKenna 
for a "voluntary" stipulation of dismissal under HRCP Rule 41(a)(1)(B). 
Furthermore, despite that HRCP Rule 41(a)(1)(B)
 
expressly requires that a stipulation to dismiss must be "signed
 by all parties who have appeared in the action[,]" Appellee Kim
 and Appellee Hawaiian Isles Adjusting did not sign the March 16,
 2015 dismissal order. The absence of signatures by all parties
 who appeared in the action (including Appellees Kim and Hawaiian
 Isles Adjusting and Appellant McKenna) means that the March 16,
 2015 dismissal order does not comply with the express
 requirements under HRCP Rule 41(a)(1)(B) for a stipulation to
 dismiss all claims. With the signature of the presiding judge,
 the March 16, 2015 dismissal order appears to be an order of the
 circuit court that purports to dismiss all claims. 
As already stated, "based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, 
an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai
'i at 254, 195 
P.3d at 1186. On October 1, 2015, the circuit court clerk filed the record on appeal for appellate court case number CAAP-15­0000554, which does not contain an appealable final judgment. Because the circuit court has not yet entered an appealable final judgment that, on its face, resolves all claims as to all parties, the July 2, 2015 order is not yet eligible for appellate review, and we lack appellate jurisdiction over appellate court case number CAAP-15-0000554 under HRS § 641-1(a), HRCP Rule 58, and the holding in Jenkins. Appellant McKenna's appeal is 
-7­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
premature, but she will have an opportunity to seek appellate
 
review of the July 2, 2015 order after a final judgment that
 resolves all claims in this case is entered. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED AND DECREED that appellate court
 
case number CAAP-15-0000554 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are
 
dismissed as moot.
