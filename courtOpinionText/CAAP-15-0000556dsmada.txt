ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Leonard, JJ.)

 
Upon review of (1) the record and (2) the December 15,
 
2015 order consolidating appellate court case numbers CAAP-15­
0000556 and CAAP-15-0000665 under appellate court case number
 CAAP-15-0000556, it appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
over the appeals that Applicants/Appellants/Appellants Community 
Based Education Support Services and Connections New Century Public Charter School (the Appellants) have asserted from the Honorable Melvin H. Fujino's July 14, 2015 judgment in favor of Appellee-Appellee Windward Planning Commission, County of Hawai
'i 
(Appellee Windward Planning Commission) and Intervenor/Appellee/ Appellee Jeffrey Gomes, because the July 14, 2015 judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable final judgment under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2015), Rules 58 and 72(k) of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP), and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
HRS § 91-15 (2012 & Supp. 2015) provides that "[r]eview 
of any final judgment of the circuit court or, if applicable, the environmental court, under this chapter shall be governed by chapter 602." The Hawai
'i Intermediate Court of Appeals has 
jurisdiction "[t]o hear and determine appeals from any court or agency when appeals are allowed by law[.]" HRS § 602-57(1) (Supp. 2015). The applicable law for this appeal provides that "[a]ppeals shall be allowed in civil matters from all final judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit . . . courts[.]" HRS § 641-1(a). Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). HRCP Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." "An appeal may be taken from circuit court orders resolving claims against parties only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 
1334, 1338 (1994) (emphasis added). "Thus, based on Jenkins and 
HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai
'i 245, 
254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008); Bailey v. DuVauchelle, 135 Hawai
'i 482, 489, 353 P.3d 1024, 1031 (2015). "An appeal from an 
order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 
(footnote omitted). 
Although the instant case involves an administrative
 
1
appeal, HRCP Rule 72(k)  similarly requires that, upon a circuit
court's adjudication of an administrative appeal, "the court having jurisdiction shall enter judgment." 
HRCP Rule 72(k). 
Therefore, the separate judgment document rule under the holding in 
Jenkins applies to a secondary appeal from a circuit court 
order that adjudicates an administrative appeal. See, e.g., 
Raquinio v. Nakanelua, 77 Hawai 'i 499, 500, 889 P.2d 76, 77 (App. 
1995) ("We conclude . . . that the requirements for appealability set forth in Jenkins apply to appeals from circuit court orders deciding appeals from orders entered by the Director of Labor and Industrial Relations."). When interpreting the requirements for a judgment under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i 
1
 Rule 81(e) of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure requires that
the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure "shall apply to any proceedings in a
circuit court pursuant to appeal to the circuit court from a governmental
official or body (other than a court), except as otherwise provided in Rule72." 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
-4-explained that its reason for strictly enforcing the separate
document rule was that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court.  Neither the
parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality, . . . and we should not make such searches
necessary by allowing the parties the option of waiving the
requirements of HRCP [Rule] 58.
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai# i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (citation omitted). 
Consequently, "an appeal from any judgment will be dismissed as
premature if the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve
all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary
for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)."  Id. 
In the instant case, the circuit court has attempted to
resolve all claims in this appellate case by way of two
judgments:
(1)a September 22, 2014 HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified
judgment in favor of Intervernors/Appellees/
Appellees Sidney Fuke (Appellee Fuke) and Terence
T. Yoshioka (Appellee Yoshioka) and against the
Appellants; and
(2)the July 14, 2015 judgment in favor of Appellee
Windward Planning Commission and Appellee Gomes
and against the Appellants.
A final judgment in this case must adjudicate the Appellants'
respective appeals in Civil NO. 14-1-0223 as to all of the
remaining parties whom the Appellants specifically named as
parties in the two notices of appeal that they filed in Civil NO.
14-1-0223, namely, Appellee Windward Planning Commission,
Respondent/Appellee/Appellee Department of Planning, County of
Hawai#i (Appellee County Department of Planning), Appellee Gomes,NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
-5-and Intervenor/Appellee/Appellee Sandra Song (Appellee Song). 
While the July 14, 2015 judgment adjudicates the Appellants'
respective appeals as to the Appellee Windward Planning
Commission and Appellee Gomes, the July 14, 2015 judgment does
not adjudicate the Appellants' appeals as to the Appellee County
Planning Department and Appellee Song.  Although the July 14,
2015 judgment does not adjudicate the Appellants' appeals as to
all of the remaining parties, the July 14, 2015 judgment does not
contain the finding necessary under HRCP Rule 54(b) for the
certification of a judgment as to one or more but fewer than all
claims or parties.   Although the July 14, 2015 judgment
concludes with a statement that "[t]here are not remaining claims
against any parties in this action[,]" the Supreme Court of
Hawai#i has explained that
[a] statement that declares "there are no other outstanding
claims" is not a judgment.  If the circuit court intends
that claims other than those listed in the judgment language
should be dismissed, it must say so: for example,
"Defendant Y's counterclaim is dismissed," or "Judgment upon
Defendant Y's counterclaim is entered in favor of
Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all other claims,
counterclaims, and cross-claims are dismissed."
Jenkins, 76 Hawai# i at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4
(emphases added).
Because the July 14, 2015 judgment does not resolve
this administrative appeal as to all the remaining named parties
in Civil No. 14-1-0223, the July 14, 2015 judgment does not
satisfy the requirements for an appealable final judgment under
HRS § 641-1(a), HRCP Rule 58, HRCP Rule 72(k), and the holding in
Jenkins.  Absent an appealable final judgment, this appeal is
premature and we lack jurisdiction.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED AND DECREED that
 
appellate court case number CAAP-15-0000556 is dismissed for lack
 
of appellate jurisdiction.
