JOSEPH D. JONES, also known as BOBBY R. WILLIAMS,
Defendant-Appellant, and JANA PYNE, Defendant
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CR. NO. 14-1-1296)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Joseph D. Jones, also known as
Bobby R. Williams, (Jones) appeals from the Judgment of
Conviction and Sentence entered on July 8, 2015 in the Circuit
Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court).1  After a jury trial,
the Circuit Court convicted Jones in Count 1 of Robbery in the
Second Degree, a violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 708-
841(1)(a) (2014),2 in Counts 2 and 3 of Robbery in the First
Degree, violations of HRS § 708-840(1)(b)(i) (2014) and/or HRS
1The Honorable Colette Y. Garibaldi presided.
2HRS § 708-841 provides, in relevant part:
Robbery in the second degree.   (1) A person commits the
offense of robbery in the second degree if, in the course of
committing theft or non-consensual taking of a motor
vehicle:
(a) The person uses force against the person of
anyone present with the intent to overcome that
person's physical resistance or physical power
of resistance[.]NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
§ 708-840(1)(b)(ii) (2014),3 and in Count 4 of Unauthorized
Possession of Confidential Personal Information, a violation of
HRS § 708-839.55 (2014).4  Jones was sentenced in Count 1 to ten
(10) years incarceration with a mandatory minimum of three (3)
years and four (4) months, in each of Counts 2 and 3 to twenty
(20) years incarceration with a mandatory minimum of six (6)
years and eight (8) months, and in Count 4 to five (5) years
incarceration, all terms to be served concurrently.
On appeal, Jones argues that:  (1) the Circuit Court
abused its discretion by denying Jones's motion to sever the
charges against him; (2) the Circuit Court erred by denying
3HRS § 708-840 provides, in relevant parts:
(1) A person commits the offense of robbery in the first
degree if, in the course of committing theft or
non-consensual taking of a motor vehicle:
. . . .
(b) The person is armed with a dangerous instrument
or a simulated firearm and:
(i) The person uses force against the person
of anyone present with intent to overcome
that person's physical resistance or
physical power of resistance; or
(ii) The person threatens the imminent use of
force against the person of anyone present
with intent to compel acquiescence to the
taking of or escaping with the property;
. . . .
(2) As used in this section:
. . . .
"Simulated firearm" means any object that:
(a) Substantially resembles a firearm;
(b) Can reasonably be perceived to be a firearm; or
(c) Is used or brandished as a firearm.
4HRS § 708-839.55 provides, in relevant part:
Unauthorized possession of confidential personal
information.   (1) A person commits the offense of
unauthorized possession of confidential personal information
if that person intentionally or knowingly possesses, without
authorization, any confidential personal information of
another in any form, including but not limited to mail,
physical documents, identification cards, or information
stored in digital form.
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Jones's motion to dismiss the robbery charges against him because
the charging language failed to include the offenses' requisite
states of mind; (3) the Circuit Court erred by denying Jones's
motion to dismiss the Unauthorized Possession of Confidential
Personal Information charge because the indictment failed to
define the term "confidential personal information"; and
(4) there was insufficient evidence to support Jones's
convictions.5
After a careful review and consideration of the
parties' arguments, the record on appeal, and relevant legal
authorities, we resolve Jones's points on appeal as follows and
affirm his convictions in Count 1-3, and vacate and remand
Count 4 to the Circuit Court with instructions to dismiss without
prejudice.
1. Jones contends the Circuit Court abused its
discretion by denying his motion to sever the charges against
him.  Jones waived his opportunity to contest the Circuit Court's
ruling on the motion to sever.  The Hawai #i Supreme Court has
previously ruled that a failure to renew a pretrial motion for
severance waives the claim. State v. Balanza, 93 Hawai# i 279,
288, 1 P.3d 281, 290 (2000) (citing State v. Hilongo , 64 Haw.
577, 579, 645 P.2d 314, 316 (1982) (citing State v. Matias , 57
Haw. 96, 99–100, 550 P.2d 900, 902–03, (1976))).  This is due in
part to the difficulty of making a finding of prejudice before
trial. Matias, 57 Haw. at 98, 550 P.2d at 902.  The record on
appeal contains no indication that Jones renewed his motion for
severance either at the close of the prosecution's case or at the
close of all evidence.  Insofar as Jones did not renew his motion
for severance at the close of the prosecution's case or at the
close of all evidence, his claim of error on this point was
waived.
2. The Circuit Court did not err in denying Jones's
motion to dismiss Counts 1-3 for failing to include the offenses'
5Jones's points have been restyled and reordered chronologically.
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
requisite states of mind.6  Jones argues that the Circuit Court
erred because the charges were fatally defective for failing to
include the requisite states of mind.
Whether a charge sets forth all the essential elements
of the offense is a question of law reviewed by the appellate
courts de novo.   State v. Young, 107 Hawai #i 36, 39, 109 P.3d
677, 680 (2005).  Generally, "[w]here the statute sets forth with
reasonable clarity all essential elements of the crime intended
6In each of Counts 1-3, Jones was charged, in pertinent part, as
follows:
COUNT 1: On or about August 5, 2014, in the City and County
of Honolulu, State of Hawai #i, JOSEPH D. JONES also known as
Bobby R. Williams and JANA PYNE, while in the course of
committing theft from Young's Grocery Store and/or [First
Complaining Witness (CW1)], did use force against the person
of [CW1], a person who was present, with the intent to
overcome [CW1]'s physical resistance or physical power of
resistance, thereby committing the offense of Robbery in the
Second Degree, in violation of Section 708-841(l)(a) of the
Hawai#i Revised Statutes. [(Count I)]
. . . . 
COUNT 2: On or about August 5,2014, in the City and County
of Honolulu, State of Hawai #i, JOSEPH D. JONES also known as
Bobby R. Williams and JANA PYNE, while in the course of
committing theft from Kauhale Mini Mart and/or [Second
Complaining Witness (CW2)], and while armed with a dangerous
instrument, a firearm as defined Section 706-660.1 of the
Hawaii Revised Statues, did use force against the person of
[CW2], a person who was present, with intent to overcome
[CW2]'s physical resistance or physical power of resistance,
and/or did threaten the imminent use of force against the
person of [CW2], person who was present, with intent to
compel acquiescence to the taking of or escaping with the
property, thereby committing the offense of Robbery in the
First Degree, in violation of Section 708-840(1)(b)(i)
and/or (ii) of the Hawai #i Revised Statutes. [(Count II)]
. . . . 
COUNT 3: On or about August 6, 2014, in the City and County
of Honolulu, State of Hawai #i, JOSEPH D. JONES also known as
Bobby R. Williams and JANA PYNE, while in the course of
committing theft from Ohana Grocery Wholesale & Retail
Market, Incorporated and/or [Third Complaining Witness
(CW3)], and while armed with a dangerous instrument, to wit
a firearm as defined in Section 706-600.1 of the Hawaii
Revised Statues, did use force against the person of CW3, a
person who was present, with intent to overcome CW3's
physical resistance or physical power of resistance and/or
did threaten the imminent use of force against the person of
CW3, a person who was present, with intent to compel
acquiescence to the taking of or escaping with the property,
thereby committing the offense of Robbery in the First
Degree, in violation of Section 708-840(l)(b)(i) and/or (ii)
of the Hawai #i Revised Statutes. [(Count III)]

to be punished, and fully defines the offense in unmistakable
terms readily comprehensible to persons of common understanding,
a charge drawn in the language of the statute is sufficient."
State v. Wheeler , 121 Hawai #i 383, 393, 219 P.3d 1170, 1180
(2009) (quoting State v. Jendrusch , 58 Haw. 279, 282, 567 P.2d
1242, 1245 (1977)) (internal quotation marks omitted).   Although
not an element of an offense, a charging instrument must include
the applicable mens rea of the crime so to "alert the defendants
of precisely what they needed to defend against to avoid a
conviction."  State v. Gonzalez, 128 Hawai# i 314, 324, 288 P.3d
788, 798 (2012) (quoting State v. Nesmith , 127 Hawai #i 48, 56,
276 P.3d 617, 625 (2012)) (internal quotation marks omitted).   
Jones argues that "HRS 708-840 [(Robbery in the First Degree)]
and 708-841 [(Robbery in the Second Degree)] do not specify the
state of mind applicable to the 'did use force against' or
'threatens the imminent use of force' element of the offense"
and, therefore, the robbery charges, which tracked the language
of the statutes, were deficient.  We disagree based on the
explicit language of the robbery statutes themselves.  E.g.,
State v. Silver , 125 Hawai #i 1, 4, 249 P.3d 1141, 1144 (2011)
(citations omitted) (the fundamental starting point for statutory
interpretation is the language of the statute itself); see HRS
§ 708-840(1)(b); HRS § 708-840.  In Count 1, the indictment
recites the required mental state as "the intent to overcome"
taken from the statute.  In Counts 2 and 3, the indictment
recites "with intent to overcome" and/or "with intent to compel
acquiescence" taken from the statute.  We interpret this language
to specify the intentional state of mind as that to be proven
against Jones.  Therefore, the Circuit Court did not err by
denying Jones's motion to dismiss Counts 1-3 for failing to
include the applicable state of mind.  See State v. Manning , 139
Hawai#i 349, 389 P.3d 944, CAAP-14-0000766, 2017 WL 770781 at *1
(App. Feb. 28, 2017) (SDO).
3. The Circuit Court erred by denying Jones's motion
to dismiss Count 4 because the indictment failed to define the
term "confidential personal information."  In State v. Pacquing,
the Hawai# i Supreme Court held an Unauthorized Possession of
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Confidential Personal Information complaint tracking the
statutory language must be dismissed without prejudice as
insufficient. 139 Hawai# i 302, 308–09, 389 P.3d 897, 903–04
(2016).  There, the charge was insufficient for failing to define
"personal confidential information" or specifying the charged
items of information. Id.  at 308, 389 P.3d at 903.  
Here, the indictment against Jones was nearly identical to the
complaint deemed insufficient in Pacquing and contained neither
the statutory definition of "confidential personal information"
nor specified the charged items of information.  Consequently,
the Circuit Court erred by denying Jones's motion to dismiss
Count 4 because the indictment was legally insufficient.  As
such, we must remand to the Circuit Court for the count to be
dismissed without prejudice.  Id. at 308-09, 389 P.3d at 903-04.
4. The Circuit Court did not plainly err in denying
Jones's motion for judgment of acquittal as, taking the evidence
in the light most favorable to the prosecution, State v. Timoteo ,
87 Hawai #i 108, 112-13, 952 P.2d 865, 869-70 (1997), there was
substantial evidence to support his robbery convictions.
As an initial matter, we note that Jones failed to
properly preserve this issue before the Circuit Court.  Pursuant
to Hawai# i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 29(a),7 Jones
moved for judgment of acquittal at the close of the State's case. 
The Circuit Court denied the motion.8  Thereafter, Jones
7HRPP Rule 29(a) provides:
(a) Motion Before Submission to Jury.   Motions for
directed verdict are abolished and motions for judgment of
acquittal shall be used in their place.  The court on motion
of a defendant or of its own motion shall order the entry of
judgment of acquittal of one or more offenses alleged in the
charge after the evidence on either side is closed if the
evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction of such
offense or offenses.  If a defendant's motion for judgment
of acquittal at the close of the evidence offered by the
prosecution is not granted, the defendant may offer evidence
without having reserved the right.
8HRPP Rule 29(b) provides:
(b) Reservation of Decision on Motion.  If a motion
for judgment of acquittal is made at the close of the
evidence offered by the prosecution, the court shall not
reserve decision thereon.  If such motion is made after all
parties have rested, the court may reserve decision on the
(continued...)
6NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
presented himself as a witness in his defense.  Jones did not
renew the motion after he rested or after all evidence had been
presented.
In light of his failure to preserve a challenge to the
Circuit Court's denial at the end of the State's case, we must
review Jones's sufficiency claim for plain error under HRPP Rule
52(b), and in light of all evidence adduced at trial.  See State
v. Rodrigues, 6 Haw. App. 580, 580, 733 P.2d 1222, 1223 (1987)
(defendant lost his right to contest HRPP Rule 29(a) ruling when
he introduced evidence after his motion was denied).
While Jones was charged as a principal to the robbery
offenses, he could have been convicted as an accomplice if the
evidence indicated such.9  See State v. Fukusaku , 85 Hawai #i 462,
486, 946 P.2d 32, 56 (1997).  "HRS § 702–221[(2014)] states that
a person can be guilty of an offense if he/she commits the
offense by his/her own conduct or if he/she is an accomplice to
another person in the commission of the offense." State v. Toma,
137 Hawai #i 18,364 P.3d 535, SCAP-13-0000029, 2015 WL 9303983 at
*5 (Haw. Dec. 21, 2015) (mem).  "A person is an accomplice of
another person in the commission of an offense if . . . [w]ith
the intention of promoting or facilitating the commission of the
offense, the person . . . [a]ids or agrees or attempts to aide
the other person in planning or committing it[.]"  See  HRS § 702-
222(1)(b) (2014).  Prior to trial, the court severed the trials
for Jones and Jana Pyne (Pyne), codefendant in the robbery
counts.
First, there was sufficient evidence to support Jones's
conviction for Robbery in the Second Degree, as alleged in
Count 1 of his indictment.  See  HRS § 708-841.  The complaining
witness in Count 1 (CW1) testified that Jones grabbed him by the
neck and tilted his head back, Pyne sprayed pepper spray on CW1,
8(...continued)
motion, submit the case to the jury and decide the motion
either before the jury returns a verdict or after it returns
a verdict of guilty or is discharged without having returned
a verdict.
9An accomplice liability jury instruction was given over the
objection of Jones, a decision that he does not challenge on appeal.
7NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Jones asked CW1 for the location of the cash register, and then
$300-$400 was taken from the cash register.  Jones admitted that
he took cigarettes and Pyne took money.  Based on these facts,
there was sufficient evidence to find Jones guilty of Robbery in
the Second Degree.
Second, there was sufficient evidence to support
Jones's conviction for Robbery in the First Degree, as alleged in
Count 2 of his indictment.  See  HRS § 708-840(1)(b).  The
complaining witness in Count 2 (CW2) testified Jones pointed a
gun at her, demanded the store's money, and while pointing the
gun, reached into the register, taking about $250.  Jones
admitted taking money from CW2's cash register and walking out of
the Kauhale Mini Mart.  Based on these facts, there was
sufficient evidence to find Jones guilty of Robbery in the First
Degree.
Third, there was sufficient evidence to support Jones's
conviction for Robbery in the First Degree, as alleged in Count 3
of his indictment. See HRS § 708-840(1)(b).  The complaining
witness in Count 3 (CW3) testified that Jones entered the Ohana
Grocery Wholesale Market asking to use the bathroom.  Pyne then
entered the store, pulled out a gun, and demanded that CW3 open
the cash register.  When CW3 refused, Pyne pistol-whipped CW3 and
then fired the gun at her, hitting a chair.  Jones testified that
he drove Pyne to the store, witnessed Pyne shoot at CW3, and then
drove Pyne back to the motel after the shooting, knowing that
Pyne was unable to operate the car's manual transmission.  Given
the evidence presented at trial, there was sufficient evidence to
find Jones guilty as an accomplice of Robbery in the First Degree
in Count 3.
Based on the testimony of the witnesses and viewing all
inferences in the light most favorable to the State, sufficient
evidence was provided to find Jones guilty of the robbery
offenses.  The Circuit Court did not plainly err in denying
Jones's motion for judgment of acquittal.  
Therefore, we affirm the Circuit Court of the First
Circuit's July 8, 2015 Judgment of Conviction and Sentence with
regard to Counts 1-3 and vacate and remand Count 4 with
8NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
instructions to dismiss without prejudice.  It is further ordered
that the Circuit Court correct the July 8, 2015 Judgment of
Conviction and Sentence insofar as the statutory citation for
Counts 2 and 3 is in error.
