OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v. 
 ANDREW MAXWELL COX, Defendant-Appellant, 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CR. NO. 14-1-324K) 
MEMORANDUM OPINION 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Andrew Maxwell Cox (Cox) appeals 
from the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence (Judgment) for 
Criminal Contempt of Court entered by the Circuit Court of the 
Third Circuit (Circuit Court)1 on June 16, 2015. Cox contends 
that the Circuit Court erred by: 
1. admitting State's exhibit no. 3, the Hawai# i 
Community Correctional Center (HCCC) Non-Admission/Late 
Admission/Violations report, into evidence; 
2. admitting State's exhibits nos. 1 and 2 into 
evidence by stipulation without obtaining a waiver of Cox's 
constitutional right to confrontation; 
3. convicting Cox despite the State's failure to 
prove that Cox acted knowingly with respect to his conduct; and 
4. failing to dismiss the charge as de minimis. 
For the reasons explained below, we reverse the 
Judgment. 
1 The Honorable Melvin H. Fujino presided over the contempt trial. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
I. 
On January 14, 2015, Cox was charged by amended 
complaint with Assault in the Second Degree and Terroristic 
Threatening in the First Degree. On January 14, 2015, pursuant 
to a plea agreement, Cox signed a waiver of indictment, pleaded 
guilty to Terroristic Threatening in the First Degree, and moved 
to defer acceptance of his plea. 
A sentencing hearing was held on March 20, 2015. The 
Circuit Court2 accepted Cox's deferred acceptance of guilty plea 
and sentenced him to one year in prison with credit for time served, mittimus to issue forthwith. Cox requested a delay of 
mittimus to put his affairs in order. The State objected based 
on Cox having been on release status since January 2015, knowing 
the charges against him were serious, and knowing that he might 
be taken into custody immediately after the sentencing hearing. 
The Circuit Court granted an eleven-day delay, stating: 
So here's it: March 31, 12:00, you report to HCCC. If you
are not there by 12:00, 12:00 noon, at HCCC, you are goingto be resentenced, and it's not going to be one year. I'll just tell you that. 
The court denied Cox's request to serve his sentence 
intermittently. Cox signed, in open court, the Order Granting 
Motion for Deferred Acceptance of Guilty Plea (Order). While the 
signing of the Order was being placed on the record, the 
following colloquy took place: 
THE COURT: . . . When are you going to report to jail? 
MR. COX: The 31st. THE COURT: What time? MR. COX: By noon. 
2 The Honorable Ronald Ibarra presided over the sentencing hearing.

The Order was filed on March 23, 2015. It stated: 
You Shall: 
. . . . 
2. Be committed to the custody of the Director of
the Department of Public Safety for a period ofincarceration of: ONE (1) YEAR, with credit for
time served. Mittimus to issue MARCH 31, 2015
at 12:00 p.m . 
(capitalization and bold type in original). Attached to the 
Order was the Mittimus, which stated: 
THIS MITTIMUS IS EFFECTIVE MARCH 31, 2015 AT 12:00 P.M. 
(capitalization in original). On April 10, 2015, after Cox was 
apparently late in reporting to HCCC, the Circuit Court issued a 
bench warrant and ordered Cox to show cause why he should not be 
held in contempt of court for reporting late. 
Cox was tried for criminal contempt of court on June 9, 
2015. At the beginning of the trial the parties stipulated to 
admission of State's exhibits 1 and 2 into evidence. Exhibit 1 
was a certified copy of the Order Granting Motion for Deferred 
Acceptance of Guilty Plea [and] Notice of Entry filed on 
March 23, 2015. Exhibit 2 was a certified copy of the Circuit 
Court's minutes from Cox's sentencing hearing on March 20, 2015. 
The State's only witness was the HCCC employee 
(Castillo-Takeue) who maintained HCCC's inmate files. She 
authenticated State's exhibit no. 3 (Exhibit 3), the HCCC "Non-
Admission/Late Admission/Violations" report form contained in 
Cox's inmate file. It stated that Cox reported to HCCC at 
12:25 p.m. on March 31, 2015. It was prepared and signed by 
HCCC's watch supervisor (Sgt. Ka#aeo).  The Circuit Court 
received Exhibit 3 into evidence over Cox's objection. 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Cox moved for judgment of acquittal after the State 
rested. The motion was denied. After a colloquy3, the Circuit 
Court found that Cox knowingly and voluntarily waived his 
constitutional right to remain silent, and was knowingly and 
voluntarily exercising his right to testify. Cox testified that 
he caught a ride to HCCC, leaving Kona at 9:00 a.m. and arriving 
in Hilo "Just before noon" but "By the time we finally made it to 
the import [sic] desk, it was 12:20 according to their clock." 
Cox called no other witnesses. The Circuit Court found Cox 
guilty. The Judgment was filed on June 16, 2015. This appeal 
followed. 
II. 
A. Exhibit 3 was testimonial hearsay not subject to any
HRE 803 exception. 
At trial Cox objected to Exhibit 3 based on lack of 
foundation. The Circuit Court admitted the exhibit into 
evidence. On appeal Cox contends that Exhibit 3 was testimonial, 
was prepared specifically for trial presentation, and should have 
been excluded because its author (Sgt. Ka# aeo) was not subject to 
cross-examination in violation of Cox's constitutional right to confrontation.
4 Because Cox did not raise the constitutional 
objection at trial, we review for plain error. Hawai# i Rules of 
Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 52(b) (1977). 
The State contends that Exhibit 3 was not testimonial, 
citing State v. Fields, 115 Hawai# i 503, 168 P.3d 955 (2007) for 
3 Cox does not challenge the adequacy of the Tachibana colloquy.
See Tachibana v. State, 79 Hawai #i 226, 900 P.2d 1293 (1995). 
4 The confrontation clause of article I, section 14 of the Hawaii
Constitution states: "In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy
the right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses against the accused[.]"The Confrontation Clause of the United States Constitution is virtuallyidentical and provides, in pertinent part: "In all criminal prosecutions, theaccused shall enjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the witnessesagainst him[.]" U.S. Const. amend. VI.

the proposition that "business records" are "clearly 
nontestimonial." Id. at 513, 168 P.3d at 965 (citing Crawford v. 
Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 51, 56 (2004)). The Circuit Court 
admitted Exhibit 3 "as a business exception records [sic]." 
Castillo-Takeue testified that Exhibit 3 was a record 
"that HCCC . . . commonly keeps within their custody of the 
records department" and that "the sergeants" input the 
information. Hawai# i Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 803 (1993 & 
Supp. 2002) provides, in relevant part: 
The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule,
even though the declarant is available as a witness: 
. . . . 
(b) Other exceptions. 
. . . . 
(6) Records of regularly conducted activity. A
memorandum, report, record, or data compilation,in any form, of acts, events, conditions,opinions, or diagnoses, made in the course of aregularly conducted activity, at or near thetime of the acts, events, conditions, opinions,or diagnoses, as shown by the testimony of thecustodian or other qualified witness, . . .unless the sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness. 
. . . . 
(8) Public records and reports. Records, reports,statements, or data compilations, in any form,of public offices or agencies, setting forth(A) the activities of the office or agency, or(B) matters observed pursuant to duty imposed bylaw as to which matters there was a duty toreport, excluding, however, in criminal casesmatters observed by police officers and otherlaw enforcement personnel[.] 
(emphasis added). Exhibit 3 was a record of a public agency 
(HCCC) reporting on the observation by a law enforcement officer 
(Sgt. Ka#aeo) in a criminal case, offered to prove the truth of 
the matter asserted (Cox's late reporting to HCCC). It does not qualify under the hearsay exception for business or public 
records. See Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 557 U.S. 305, 322 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2009) (reports generated by law enforcement officials do not 
qualify as business or public records, citing Federal Rules of 
Evidence Rule 803(8) defining public records as "excluding, 
however, in criminal cases matters observed by police officers 
and other law enforcement personnel"). 
Castillo-Takeue did not testify that the record is 
routinely completed by a sergeant for every inmate who reports to 
the HCCC receiving desk. The document itself indicates it is 
only completed if a person does not report, reports late, is 
turned away (e.g., no mittimus or order of commitment), or 
commits a violation. To the extent "the primary purpose of" the 
document "is to establish or prove past events potentially 
relevant to later criminal prosecution," it is testimonial. 
Fields, 115 Hawai# i at 514, 168 P.3d at 966 (quoting Davis v. 
Washington, 547 U.S. 813, 822 (2006)). 
Moreover, the statement in Exhibit 3 was made by a law 
enforcement officer declarant and was specifically directed against Cox. The confrontation clause of the 
Hawai# i 
Constitution applies to "witnesses against the accused[.]" The Confrontation Clause of the United States Constitution applies to 
"witnesses against him" (referring to "the accused"). That 
distinguishes this case from the Hawai# i cases finding records 
containing information prepared by declarants who were not law enforcement officers, and which were not specific as to the 
defendant, to be nontestimonial. See State v. Marshall, 114 
Hawai# i 396, 401, 163 P.3d 199, 204 (App. 2007), cert. rejected, 
No. 27694, 2007 WL 4358284 (Haw. Dec. 13, 2007) (sworn statements of Intoxilyzer supervisor that machine used to test defendant had 
been properly calibrated and tested for accuracy, and that 
contained no mention of defendant's blood alcohol level, were 
"merely a record of routine, nonadversarial matters made in a 
nonadversarial setting" and not testimonial) (citation and 
original quotation marks omitted); State v. Fitzwater, 122 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawai# i 354, 358, 374, 227 P.3d 520, 524, 540 (2010) (speedometer 
check card created by Jack's Speedo shop "in a non-adversarial 
setting in the regular course of maintaining [arresting 
officer's] police vehicle, five months prior to the alleged 
speeding incident" that did not mention defendant's speed held 
nontestimonial); State v. Cruz, 135 Hawai
#i 294, 297-298, 349 
P.3d 401, 404-405 (App. 2015), cert. dismissed as improvidently granted, No. SCWC-12-0000477, 2018 WL 1611669 (Haw. April 3, 
2018) (holding that cell phone provider's call logs for 
defendant's telephone number, documenting all incoming and 
outgoing calls, "are generally admissible absent confrontation 
. . . because — having been created for the administration of an 
entity's affairs and not for the purpose of establishing or 
proving some fact at trial — they are not testimonial"). 
In this case, Exhibit 3 was not only created for the 
records of a public agency (HCCC); it was faxed to the Circuit 
Court and presumably triggered the issuance of the bench warrant 
and order to show cause. 
We hold that Sgt. Ka# aeo's statement 
that Cox reported to HCCC at 12:25 p.m. was testimonial hearsay, not subject to any HRE 803 exception, and the State's failure to 
call Sgt. 
Ka#aeo as a trial witness violated Cox's constitutional 
right to confront Sgt. Ka# aeo about his statement. 
"Under plain error review, if the substantial rights of 
the defendant are implicated, then the error may be corrected on appeal unless it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt." State 
v. Taylor, 130 
Hawai# i 196, 222–23, 307 P.3d 1142, 1168–69 (2013) 
(citation and original quotation marks omitted). The State argues that the admission of Exhibit 3 into evidence was harmless 
because Cox admitted at trial that "By the time we finally made 
it to the import [sic] desk, it was 12:20 according to their 
clock." The Circuit Court's error was not harmless beyond a 
reasonable doubt because Exhibit 3 was the only evidence in the

State's case establishing that Cox did not report to HCCC by noon 
on March 31, 2015. 
Based on the foregoing, we reverse the Judgment. DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, March 20, 2019.
