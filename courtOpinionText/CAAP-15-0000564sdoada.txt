ROBERT Y. GIERHART, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(HONOLULU DIVISION)
(CASE NO. 1DTA-14-00816)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Robert Y. Gierhart (Gierhart)
 
appeals from a Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and
 
Plea/Judgment filed on July 8, 2015 in the District Court of the
 First Circuit, Honolulu Division (District Court), convicting him
 
of Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant
 
(OVUII) under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) §291E-61(a)(1) and
 
1
(a)(3), based on a prior ruling by the District Court  thatdenied Gierhart's motion to dismiss for violation of Hawai
'i 
Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 48.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On appeal, Gierhart contends that: (1) the District
 
Court erred in determining that exceptional circumstances existed
 
to continue the trial based on court congestion and thus not
 counting the period against the State under HRPP Rule 48 and,
 where the continuance based on court congestion resulted in
 violation of HRPP Rule 48, in failing to dismiss the case for
 such violation; and (2) if the court congestion issue is deemed
 waived for failure of trial counsel to object, counsel was
 ineffective.
 
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai
'i (State) does not 
dispute that the District Court failed to articulate exceptional circumstances supporting exclusion under HRPP Rule 48 based upon court congestion. The State instead argues that the continuance for court congestion was effected through Gierhart's consent where he did not object, and, as to ineffective assistance of counsel, an HRPP Rule 40 proceeding is more appropriate for trial counsel to provide the basis for his actions. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised therein, as well as
 the relevant case law and authority, we resolve Gierhart’s points
 of error as follows:
 
(1) Under HRPP Rule 48(c)(2), "periods that delay the
 
commencement of trial and are caused by congestion of the trial
 docket when the congestion is attributable to exceptional
 circumstances" are excluded in computing the time for trial
 commencement. The District Court ruled that the eighty-five-day
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
period between September 15, 2014 and December 9, 2014 was
 
excluded due to exceptional and extraordinary circumstances where
 "the State was ready on both cases each time, and witnesses are
 present for the State" and ruled that the case would be
 "congested out," and further determining that the "[t]ime does
 not run against the State."
 
A trial court's findings of fact (FOFs) in deciding an HRPP
Rule 48(b) motion to dismiss, are subject to the clearly
erroneous standard of review. However, whether those facts
fall within HRPP Rule 48(b)'s exclusionary provisions is a
question of law, the determination of which is freely
reviewable pursuant to the "right/wrong" test.
 
State v. Diaz, 100 Hawai 'i 210, 216-17, 58 P.3d 1257, 1263-64 
(2002) (citation and ellipses omitted). 
The District Court erred when it concluded that
 
exceptional and extraordinary circumstances existed based on the
 
State being ready for trial and court congestion and, therefore,
 improperly excluded the eighty-five days under HRPP Rule 48. As
 set forth in HRPP Rule 48(c)(2), a period is excluded when
 congestion of the trial docket is due to exceptional
 circumstances. "In order for court congestion to qualify as
 'exceptional,' as opposed to usual, there must be a showing of
 deviation from the norm." State v. Caspino, 73 Haw. 256, 257,
 
831 P.2d 1334, 1335 (1992). 
The Hawaii Supreme Court has held for purposes of HRPP 
Rule 48(c)(2) that there were exceptional circumstances causing court congestion in circumstances far different than this case. See State v. Baron, 80 Hawai
'i 107, 110, 905 P.2d 613, 616 (1995) 
(finding exceptional circumstances when two judges were reassigned, one judge retired, one judge was temporarily assigned 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to another court, potential replacement judges were on vacation,
 
and there was a marked increase in jury trial demands); State v.
 Herrera, 63 Haw. 405, 407, 629 P.2d 626, 628 (1981) (finding
 exceptional circumstances when the normal condition of the trial
 court's criminal division was affected because two of the four
 judges submitted their resignations and their workload was
 reduced so they could complete prior assignments, replacement
 judges were in place at different times, the number of judges was
 increased due to the workload, a newly assigned criminal judge
 had a limited schedule in order to complete his family court
 cases, new judges had limited assignments to familiarize
 themselves with the assignments, and there was an increase in the
 number of indictments from fifteen to twenty-one cases per week
 to twenty-three to twenty-five cases per week); State v. Lord, 63
 Haw. 270, 273, 625 P.2d 1038, 1040 (1981) (holding that court
 congestion was caused by exceptional circumstances when there
 were two judges to handle both criminal and civil cases and
 defendant's trial was continued because there was "an inordinate
 number of criminal indictments returned by the grand jury"). The
 instant case is unlike Baron, Herrera, and Lord. Here, the
 record does not reflect any exceptional circumstance meeting the
 requirements of HRPP 48(c)(2). Therefore, it was error for the
 District Court to exclude the eighty-five-day period.
 
We agree in part, however, with the State's argument
 
that there was consent by Gierhart’s trial counsel. Under HRPP
 48(c)(3), "periods that delay the commencement of trial and are
 caused by a continuance granted at the request or with the

 (2) The standard for claims of ineffective assistance
of counsel on appeal is whether, "viewed as a whole, the

 
assistance provided was 'within the range of competence demanded
 
of attorneys in criminal cases.'" Dan v. State, 76 Hawai 'i 423, 
427, 879 P.2d 528, 532 (1994) (citation and brackets omitted).
 
 
Briones v. State,NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
consent of the defendant or defendant's counsel" are excluded. 
(Emphasis added). Although informed of the continued trial date,
 Gierhart’s trial counsel did not object when apprised of the new
 date, the District Court's determination of exceptional and
 extraordinary circumstance due to court congestion, or that the
 continuance would not be counted against the State. Although
 trial counsel later objected to the District Court’s
 determination, at that point the Rule 48 time period had already
 lapsed, and such objection was untimely. In this circumstance,
 we conclude that Gierhart’s trial counsel effectively consented
 to the period that delayed trial. Based on such consent, we
 conclude that the District Court did not err in denying the
 motion to dismiss for violation of Rule 48. 
General claims of ineffectiveness are insufficient and every
action or omission is not subject to inquiry. Specific
actions or omissions alleged to be error but which had an
obvious tactical basis for benefitting the defendant's case
 
will not be subject to further scrutiny. If, however, the
action or omission had no obvious basis for benefitting the
defendant's case and it "resulted in the withdrawal or
 
substantial impairment of a potentially meritorious
defense," then it will be evaluated as information that an
ordinarily competent criminal attorney should have had.

(quoting  74 Haw. 442, 462-63, 848 P.2d 966, 976
 
(1993)). However, "[i]f the record is unclear or void as to the
 
basis for counsel's actions, counsel shall be given the

opportunity to explain his or her actions in an appropriate 
proceeding before the trial court judge." Briones, 74 Haw at 
463, 848 P.2d at 977 (1993) (citation omitted). Here, the record is unclear as to the basis for counsel's actions. "Normally, a [HRPP] Rule 40 hearing is the proper vehicle for ineffective assistance of counsel claims." State v. Brantley, 84 Hawai
'i 
112, 122, 929 P.2d 1362, 1372 (App. 1996), as amended (Nov. 26, 1996). In this case, we conclude that an HRPP Rule 40 hearing would be the appropriate vehicle to address an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. 
For these reasons, the District Court's Notice of Entry
 
of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment filed on July 8, 2015
 is affirmed, without prejudice to Gierhart filing a petition
 pursuant to HRPP Rule 40 to allege ineffective assistance of
 trial counsel.
