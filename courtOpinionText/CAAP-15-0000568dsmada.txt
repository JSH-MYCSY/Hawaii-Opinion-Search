IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
ALBERT BATALONA, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P. NO. 10-1-0075; CR. NO. 03-1-0787)
 
ORDER DISMISSING THE APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the records, it appears that this court
 
lacks appellate jurisdiction over the appeal from the Amended
 
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Granting in Part
 and Denying in Part Petition for Post-Conviction Relief (Amended
 Order), filed on July 17, 2015 in the Circuit Court of the First
 Circuit. 
In the Amended Order, the Circuit Court denied in part
 
and granted in part Petitioner-Appellant Albert Batalona's
 Petition for Post-Conviction Relief (Petition). Specifically,
 the Circuit Court denied Appellant's challenge to his extended
 term sentence and granted Appellant a hearing on his claim
 regarding imposition of restitution and a fine. The Circuit
 Court scheduled a hearing on October 7, 2015. However, the
 Circuit Court's decision on Appellant's claim regarding
 imposition of a fine and restitution is not in the record on
 appeal.

"The right of appeal in a criminal case is purely 
statutory and exists only when given by some constitutional or 
statutory provision." State v. Poohina, 97 Hawai 'i 505, 509, 40 
P.3d 907, 911 (2002) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Pursuant to HRS § 641-11 and "HRPP [Rule] 40(h), appeals from proceedings for post-conviction relief may be made from a judgment entered in the proceeding and must be taken in accordance with Rule 4(b) of the Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP)." Grattafiori v. State, 79 Hawai 'i 10, 13, 897 
P.2d 937, 940 (1995) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). 
The Amended Order set a hearing on Appellant's claim
 
regarding imposition of a fine and restitution. However, the
 record on appeal does not contain an order disposing of
 Appellant's claim regarding imposition of a fine and restitution. 
There is no final adjudication of the Petition that leaves
 nothing further to be accomplished. Therefore, there is no final
 appealable judgment or order, pursuant to HRS § 641-11 and
 HRPP Rule 40(h). 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is dismissed for
 
lack of appellate jurisdiction.
