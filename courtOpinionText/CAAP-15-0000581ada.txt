erred in upholding the interpretation, by Defendant-Appellee/ 
Appellee County of Kaua 'i Planning Department (Planning

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Department), of the Kaua 'i County Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance 
(CZO) as requiring an applicant for a nonconforming use 
certificate to have authorization from at least a 75% interest of 
the equitable and legal title of the lot.
I. BACKGROUND
 
The Ferris Trust owned a parcel of land on the island 
of Kaua 'i (Property). The Property was located on land 
designated by the County of Kaua 'i as an agriculture district, 
which restricted use of the land to approved agricultural purposes and provided for a special tax assessment privilege. The Property contained a single-family dwelling constructed in 2000. The Ferris Trust began renting the dwelling to vacationers in 2003 under the business name "Retreat at Hale Luana & Plantation." 
In 2008, Defendant-Appellee/Appellee County of Kaua 'i 
(County) adopted Ordinance Number 864 (Ordinance 864), which 
amended the County's CZO, Kaua 'i County Code 1987 (KCC) Chapter 
8. Ordinance 864 prohibited new transient vacation rentals
 
2
(TVRs) outside land designated as a Visitor Destination Area,
and required the registration of lawfully existing TVRs within
 
six months after the enactment of the amended ordinance.
 Ordinance 864 § 8-17.10 allowed "the owner, operator or
 proprietor of any single-family transient vacation rental"
 operating outside of a Visitor Destination Area to obtain a
 nonconforming use certificate to continue operating their TVR. 
In 2010, the County adopted Ordinance Number 904

 
(Ordinance 904), again amending the CZO, and targeting the
 
grandfathering provision established by Ordinance 864.
 
On August 23, 2010, Robert D. Ferris (Ferris), on
 
behalf of the Ferris Trust, submitted a TVR registration and
 
nonconforming use application for the Property. The Planning
 Department acknowledged receipt of the Ferris Trust's application
 
2 A "transient vacation rental" is "a dwelling unit which is provided to
transient occupants for compensation or fees, including club fees, or as part
of interval ownership involving persons unrelated by blood, with a duration of
occupancy of one hundred eighty (180) days or less." KCC § 8-1.5.

by letter dated October 4, 2010. The Planning Department asked
 
the Ferris Trust to submit "reservation lists, and receipts
 showing payment along with any other reliable information or
 proof of a nonconforming use which has been in lawful use prior
 to March 7, 2008" and "a signed and stamped as built plot, floor,
 elevation and section drawings by a licensed architect or
 engineer showing the property as it exists today . . . ."
 
The Planning Department confirmed receipt of the Ferris
 
Trust's supplemental information supporting its application for a
 nonconforming use certificate by letter dated January 13, 2011.
 The Planning Department informed the Ferris Trust that its
 application was incomplete because the Property was within a
 Condominium Property Regime (CPR) and the Ferris Trust needed the
 
consent of at least 75% of the owners of the lot to be eligible
 
to apply. The Ferris Trust owned two of the four parcels on the
 lot, which constituted only a 50% ownership interest in the lot
 for purposes of the Ferris Trust's application.
 
On August 17, 2011, the Planning Department informed
 
the Ferris Trust that the time period for applying for a
 nonconforming use certificate ended on August 16, 2011, and asked
 the Ferris Trust's counsel to advise their clients to cease and
 desist from further use of land designated as agricultural from
 further use as TVRs.
 
On August 22, 2011, the Ferris Trust submitted a 
"Petition to Appeal Decision of the Planning Director" (Petition) 
to Defendant-Appellee/Appellee Planning Commission of the County 
of Kaua
'i (Planning Commission). 
In a letter dated September 25, 2011, the owners of the
 
other two parcels within the CPR, who together held 50% of the
 ownership interests in the CPR, submitted to the Planning
 Department their objection to the Ferris Trust's application for
 a nonconforming use certificate, and sought to intervene in the
 Ferris Trust's Petition to the Planning Commission.
 
On October 18, 2012, Hearings Officer Richard F.
 
Nakamura issued "Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and
 
3
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Decision and Order" recommending the Planning Commission deny the
 
Ferris Trust's Petition.
 On November 26, 2012, the Planning Commission issued 
its "Findings of Fact and Conclusion of Law and Decision and Order of the Planning Commission of the County of Kaua
'i" 
(Planning Commission's Denial) denying the Petition. 
The Ferris Trust filed its notice of appeal to the
 
circuit court on December 12, 2010 of the Planning Commission's
 Denial. The circuit court entered its "Findings of Fact,
 Conclusions of Law; Decision and Order" on September 16, 2013
 affirming the Planning Commission's Denial. The circuit court
 entered its Final Judgment on July 16, 2015.
 
The Ferris Trust filed its notice of appeal from the
 
circuit court's decision on August 14, 2015.
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
A.	 Secondary Appeals
 
"Review of a decision made by a court upon its review 
of an administrative decision is a secondary appeal. The standard of review is one in which this court must determine whether the court under review was right or wrong in its decision." 
Leslie v. Bd. of Appeals of Cty. of Hawai 'i, 109 
Hawai'i 384, 391, 126 P.3d 1071, 1078 (2006) (quoting Lanai Co. 
v. Land Use Comm'n, 105 Hawai 'i 296, 306-07, 97 P.3d 372, 382-83 
(2004)). "To determine if the decision under review is right or 
wrong, we "apply the standards set forth in [Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)] § 91-14(g) [(2012 Repl.)] to the agency's 
decision." Leslie, 109 Hawai
'i at 391, 126 P.3d at 1078 (quoting 
Ka Pa'akai O Ka 'aina v. Land Use Comm'n, 94 Hawai 'i 31, 40, 7 P.3d 
1068, 1077 (2000). HRS § 91-14(g) provides: 
(g) Upon review of the record the court may affirm
the decision of the agency or remand the case with
instructions for further proceedings; or it may reverse or
modify the decision and order if the substantial rights of
the petitioners may have been prejudiced because the
administrative findings, conclusions, decisions, or orders
are:
 
(1)	 In violation of constitutional or statutory
provisions; or
 
4
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
(2)	 In excess of the statutory authority or
jurisdiction of the agency; or 
(3)	 Made upon unlawful procedure; or
 
(4)	 Affected by other error of law; or
 
(5)	 Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,
probative, and substantial evidence on the
whole record; or
 
(6)	 Arbitrary, capricious, or characterized by
abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted
exercise of discretion.
 
"[C]onclusions of law are reviewable under subsections (1), (2),
 
and (4)[.]" Mauna Kea Anaina Hou v. Bd. of Land & Nat. Res.,  136
 
Hawai'i 376, 388, 363 P.3d 224, 236 (2015). 
An "agency's decision carries a presumption of validity
and [an] appellant has the heavy burden of making a convincing
 showing that the decision is invalid because it is unjust and
 unreasonable in its consequences."

B.
	 Statutory Construction
 
"When interpreting county charters, municipal
 
ordinances, and administrative rules, the general principles of
 statutory construction apply." 
Kellberg v. Yuen , 131 Hawai 'i 
513, 527, 319 P.3d 432, 446 (2014) (brackets omitted) (quoting
 Hoke Lele, LLC v. City & Cty. of Honolulu, 129 Hawai
'i 164, 167, 
296 P.3d 1072, 1075 (App. 2013)). 
We interpret statutes de novo.  Shimabuku v.
 
Montgomergy Elevator Co., 79 Hawai' i 352, 357, 903 P.2d 48,
51 (1995). When construing a statute, the starting point is
the language of the statute itself. Richardson v. City &
[Cty.] of Honolulu, 76 Hawai' i 46, 63, 868 P.2d 1193,
1210 . . . . "Courts are bound to give effect to all parts
of a statute, and that no clause, sentence, or word shall be
construed as superfluous, void, or insignificant if a
construction can be legitimately found which will give force
to and preserve all words of the statute. State v.
 
Kaakimaka, 84 Hawai' i 280, 289-90, 933 P.2d 617, 626-27
(quoting State v. Ortiz, 74 Haw. 343, 351-52, 845 P.2d 547,
551-52 . . . (1993)[, abrogated on other grounds by State v.
Moore, 82 Hawai' i 202, 921 P.2d 122 (1996)]. Words are 
given their common meaning unless some wording in the
statute "requires a different interpretation." Saranillo v.
 
Silva, 78 Hawai' i 1, 10, 889 P.2d 685, 694 (1995) (citing
Ross v. Stouffer Hotel Co. (Hawaii), Ltd., 76 Hawai' i 454,
461, 879 P.2d 1037, 1044-45 (1994)).

Moreover, 
although the intention of the legislature
is to be obtained primarily from the
language of the statute itself, we have
rejected an approach to statutory
construction which limits us to the words
 of a statute, for when aid to construction
of the meaning of words, as used in the
statute, is available, there certainly can
be no rule of law which forbids its use,
however clear the words may appear on
superficial examination. Thus, the plain
language rule of statutory construction
does not preclude an examination of
sources other than the language of the
statute itself even when the language
appears clear upon perfunctory review.
Were this not the case, a court may be
unable to adequately discern the
underlying policy which the legislature
seeks to promulgate and, thus, would be
unable to determine if a literal
 construction would produce an absurd or
unjust result, inconsistent with the
policies of the statute.

Zoning laws, whether statutes or ordinances, inasmuch
as they curtail and limit uses of real estate and are in
derogation of the common law must be given strict
construction and the provisions thereof may not be extended
by implication. Nevertheless, they should be read according
to the natural and most obvious import of the language when
there is no manifest legislative intent contrarywise.

III. DISCUSSION

 
On appeal, the Ferris Trust argues that the Planning
 
Commission erred in interpreting the term "applicant" in KCC § 8­

3 The version of KCC § 8-17.10 in effect on August 23, 2010, the date
the Ferris Trust applied for a nonconforming use certificate, is reflected in
the 2012 republication of the KCC. Section 8-17.10 was not amended between
 Ordinance 904, which took effect on July 28, 2010, and the republication in
2012. Subsequently, Section 8-17.10 has been amended most recently by
Ordinance 974, which took effect on September 30, 2014.

KCC § 8-17.10, from the 2012 republication, provided in pertinent part:

 
Sec. 8-17.10	 Nonconforming Use Certificates for Single-

Family Vacation Rentals.
 
(a)
	 The purpose of this Section is to provide a process to
identify and register those single-family transient
vacation rentals as nonconforming uses which have been
in lawful use prior to the effective date of the
ordinance codified in this Article and to allow them
 to continue subject to obtaining a nonconforming use
certificate as provided by this Section.
 
(b)	 The owner, operator or proprietor of any single-family
transient vacation rental which operated outside of a
visitor designation area prior to March 7, 2008, shall
obtain a nonconforming use certificate for single-
family vacation rentals.
 
(c)	 No nonconforming use certificate shall be issued by
the Planning Director unless the use as a single-
family rental is a legal use under the [CZO], and the
applicant provides a sworn affidavit and demonstrates
to the satisfaction of the Planning Director that a
dwelling unit was being used as a vacation rental on
an ongoing basis prior to March 7, 2008. The Planning
Director, in making the decision, shall take into
consideration, among other things, the following
guidelines:
 
(1)	 The applicant had a State of Hawai' i general
excise tax license and transient accommodations 
tax license for the purpose of the lawfuloperation of single-family transient vacationrentals for a period long enough to demonstrateactual payment of taxes. 
(2)	 That prior to the effective date of the
ordinance codified in this Article, applicant
had deposits for reservations by transient
guests in exchange for compensation for use of
subject property as a vacation rental.
 
(3)	 That applicant had transient guests occupy
subject property in exchange for compensation
prior to the effective date of said ordinance,
with a pattern of consistency that evidences an
ongoing lawful enterprise.
 
(d)	 Applications for nonconforming use certificates forsingle-family transient vacation rentals located onland designated "Agricultural" pursuant to Chapter 205of the Hawai' i Revised Statutes shall be made within 
sixty (60) days of the effective date of the ordinancecodified in this Article. If an operator as definedunder Section 8-17.10(c) fails to apply for anonconforming use certificate within sixty (60) daysof said effective date, then the Planning Directorshall assess an administrative late applicationprocessing fee of one thousand five hundred dollars

"any person having a controlling interest (seventy-five percent

 § 8-1.5.
 
The Ferris Trust argues that "applicant" under KCC § 8­
1.5 was not intended to limit the word "applicant" as used in KCC
 § 8-17.10. The Ferris Trust argues that the Planning
 Department's interpretation of KCC § 8-17.10 would deprive the
 Ferris Trust of its "rights under HRS § 46-4, the United States
 Constitution, and the Hawaii State Constitution[.]"

The Ferris Trust is a property owner under Hawai 'i law  by virtue
of its ownership of the condominium and is therefore entitled to constitutional protection. Waikiki Martketplace, 86 Hawai

Constitutions both provide that no person shall be deprived of property without due process of law." (citing U.S. Const. amend. V; Haw. Const. art. I, § 5)). 
The rules of statutory construction dictate that, if
 
possible, we must interpret a statute to avoid violating
 constitutional provisions. Life of the Land, Inc. v. West Beach
 
Dev. Corp., 63 Haw. 529, 531, 631 P.2d 588, 590 (1981); see 2A

reason to reject that interpretation in favor of a reasonable,
 
constitutional alternative, if available.").
 
KCC § 8-17.10 is ambiguous as to who is eligible to
 
apply for a nonconforming use certificate. The ordinance refers
 to "[t]he owner, operator, or proprietor of any single family
 transient vacation rental which operated outside of a Visitor
 Destination area prior to March 7, 2008" as the party who "shall
 obtain" a nonconforming use certificate and who shall have the
 "burden of proof in establishing" the nonconforming use. KCC
 § 8-17.10(b), (e). The ordinance also refers to the "applicant,"
 which is generally defined in the CZO definition section to mean,
 in relevant part, a "person having a controlling interest
 (seventy-five percent (75%) or more . . .) of a lot." KCC
 § 8-1.5. In light of the express purpose of KCC § 8-17.10 and
 the need to avoid serious constitutional questions, we construe
 the ordinance as permitting the "owner, operator, or proprietor
 of any single family transient vacation rental" who had been
 operating before March 7, 2008, to apply for a nonconforming use
 certificate.
 
The express purpose of KCC § 8-17.10 is to "provide a
 
process to identify and register those single-family transient
 vacation rentals as nonconforming uses which have been in lawful
 use prior to the effective date of the ordinance [which
 specifically banned such rentals outside of Visitor Destination
 Areas] and to allow them to continue subject to obtaining a
 nonconforming use certificate as provided by this Section." KCC
 § 8-17.10(a). This purpose is consistent with the requirements
 of HRS § 46-4(a) as well as the constitutional protection
 provided to property owners with vested rights to pre-existing
 lawful uses of their property. Persons with less than a
 seventy-five percent ownership interest may be able to establish
 vested rights to prior lawful nonconforming uses. Therefore,
 precluding such persons from even applying for a nonconforming
 use certificate would be inconsistent with the purpose of the
 ordinance to identify those engaged in the prior lawful use of
 their property as a transient vacation rental and to allow them
 
10
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to apply to continue that use. In contrast, construing the
 
ordinance to permit the "owner, operator, or proprietor of any
 single family transient vacation rental which operated outside of
 a Visitor Destination Area prior to [the effective date of the
 ordinance specifically banning such use]" to apply for a
 nonconforming use certificate would be consistent with and
 advance the express purpose of the ordinance. It would give all
 those who could potentially establish a vested right to continue
 using their property as a transient vacation rental the
 opportunity to apply for, and demonstrate their entitlement to, a
 nonconforming use certificate.
 
Moreover, if we interpret KCC § 8-17.10 to restrict the 
eligibility of applicants based on the definition of "applicant" in KCC § 8-1.5, it would raise serious constitutional questions. See Waikiki Marketplace, 86 Hawai
'i at 353-54, 949 P.2d at 193­
94. As noted, persons with less than a seventy-five percent
 
ownership interest may have vested rights to pre-existing lawful
 uses. We avoid the constitutional questions by interpreting KCC
 § 8-17.10 to permit an "owner, operator, or proprietor of any
 single family transient vacation rental" who had been operating
 prior to the effective date of the ordinance to apply for a
 nonconforming use certificate.
 
We conclude that the Ferris Trust established that it
 
was an "owner, operator, or proprietor" of a single-family
 transient vacation rental prior to March 7, 2008. An "operator"
 is simply "one [who] operates a business." Webster's Tenth New
 
Collegiate Dictionary 813 (2000). A "proprietor" is "[a]n owner,
 esp. one who runs a business." Black's Law Dictionary 1414 (10th
 
ed. 2009). Although the Ferris Trust does not satisfy the
 
5
definition of "owner" under KCC § 8-1.5,  it falls within the
ordinary meaning of "operator" and "proprietor" based on its
 operation of its TVR business prior to March 7, 2008.
 
Because the Ferris Trust was able to prove it was an

 
operator or proprietor of a TVA prior to March 7, 2008, the
 
5 "Owner" is defined in KCC § 8-1.5 as "the holders of at least seventy-
five percent (75%) of the equitable and legal title of a lot."
 
11
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Planning Department was not permitted to refuse to consider or
 
process the Ferris Trust's application for a nonconforming use
 certificate on the basis that the Ferris Trust did not have a 75%
 or more controlling interest in the equitable and legal title of
 the lot. We conclude that the circuit court's decision to uphold
 the Planning Department's refusal to accept the Ferris Trust's
 application for a nonconforming use certificate under KCC § 8­17.10 was erroneous.
 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
Therefore, the "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law; 
Decision and Order" entered on September 16, 2013 in the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit is reversed and this case remanded to the circuit court with instructions to remand this case to the County of Kaua
'i Planning Department to process the Ferris 
Trust's application for a nonconforming use certificate.
