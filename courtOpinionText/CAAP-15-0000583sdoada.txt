APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-P NO. 15-1-6108)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant JPR (Father) appeals from the
 
"Order Denying Motion for the Family Court of the First Circuit
 
to Assert Jurisdiction and the Immediate Return of the Minor
 Child Filed May 1, 2015 and Dismissing Petition for Paternity
 Filed April 17, 2015" (Dismissal Order) entered on July 20, 2015
 
in the Family Court in the First Circuit (First Circuit Family
Court).
1
 
On appeal, Father argues that the First Circuit Family
 
Court's Findings of Facts (FOFs) 4-11 and 20-30 were clearly
 erroneous and abused its discretion in its Conclusions of Laws
 
(COLs) 4-10.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as

 The Honorable Linda S. Martell presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude Father's
 
appeal is without merit.
I. FOFs
 
A. FOFs 4 and 5
 
Father challenges FOFs 4 and 5, which state:
 
(4) Father resided on O' ahu when [Minor Child] was born and
continues to reside on O' ahu. 
(5) [Minor Child] lived with [Respondent-Appellee NMKB
(Mother)] for approximately four years, and frequentlyvisited Father on O' ahu. 
Father argues, "Contrary to the court's [FOFs] 4 and 5, 
[Father] and [Mother] both admit that they were an intact family 
maintaining homes on both O 'ahu as well as in Kona [on Hawai 'i 
Island] and [Father] recalls the parties separating in 2008, but [Mother] recalls the parties separating in 2009." In his opening brief, Father cites to a portion of the transcript from a July 2, 2015 joint hearing before the First Circuit Family Court and Third Circuit Family Court. However, the cited transcript does not include any evidence supporting Father's contention that the First Circuit Family Court's FOFs were "contrary" to the evidence. 
The record on appeal includes Mother's affidavit in 
support of her "Motion and Affidavit for Temporary Relief," in which she states that at the time Minor Child was born, Father lived on O
'ahu while Mother lived on Hawai 'i Island. Mother's 
affidavit also states that Minor Child lived with Mother on Hawai
'i Island for approximately four years after Minor Child was 
born, but would visit with Father often. Therefore, there was substantial evidence to support the First Circuit Family Court's FOFs 4 and 5, and Father's argument is without merit. See Fisher 
v. Fisher, 111 Hawai
'i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 (2006) ("A[n] 
FOF is clearly erroneous when . . . the record lacks substantial evidence to support the finding[.]").
B. FOF 6
 
Father challenges FOF 6, which states "(6) In
 
approximately 2010, [Minor Child] came to live with Father on
 Oahu, and frequently visited Mother in Kona." Father does not
 argue that FOF 6 was not supported by the evidence, but instead
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
claims that the finding is erroneous because it is "silent on the
 
parties' agreement regarding the minor child's custody and
 visitation." In support of his argument, Father cites to
 Mother's declaration, which states:
 
6. When [Father] and I separated, [Father] told me that
since [Minor Child] lived with me for the first four (4)
years of her life, it was now his time and in 2010, [Father]
and I came up with an agreement regarding custody and
visitation of [Minor Child.]
 
7. I allowed [Minor Child] to live with [Father] with the
understanding that [Minor Child] would spend the holidays
and summer breaks with me along with monthly visitation
during the weekend, one to two times per month, depending on
the party's schedule.
 
Father argues that Mother's declaration evidences that 
both he and Mother "admit to having a custody and visitation 
agreement that gave [Father] de facto physical custody since 2010 when they agreed that the minor child would reside on O
'ahu with 
[Father]." We fail to see how the First Circuit Family Court clearly erred in declining to include Father and Mother's purported verbal custody arrangement in its FOFs, given that the First Circuit Family Court was not required to find that Father and Mother had a prearranged custody arrangement in order to make its subsequent COLs and the inclusion of such a finding would not undermine the First Circuit Family Court's COLs. But cf. 
'rao 
Ground Water Mgmt. Area High-Level Source Water Use Permit Applications, 128 Hawai
'i 228, 256, 287 P.3d 129, 157 (2012) 
(remanding the case because the water commission did not include in its FOFs relevant facts that were needed to support its COLs). Because the First Circuit Family Court's FOF 6 is supported by substantial evidence, the FOF is not clearly erroneous. See 
Fisher, 111 Hawai
'i at 46, 137 P.3d at 360. 
C. FOFs 7 and 8
 
Father challenges FOFs 7 and 8, which state:
 
(7) In approximately March or early April 2015, [Minor
Child] went to visit Mother on Spring Break.
 
(8) During Spring Break, [Minor Child] did not want to
return to O' ahu and asked Mother if she could stay in Kona
with Mother. 
Father argues, "Contrary to the court's [FOFs] 7 and 8,
 
both parties agree that the minor child was sent to Kona on April
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
3, 2015 for Easter and was supposed to return to O 'ahu on Sunday, 
April 5, 2015 as agreed to by the parties." In support of his
 
challenge to FOFs 7 and 8, Father cites to his declaration, which
 stated in part:
 
78. [Minor Child] went to Kona on spring break, 2015 but
Mother brought her back for another family meeting with me
because [Minor Child] states she wanted to stay with Mother.
 
79. I had made arrangements for [Minor Child] to visit with
Mother from Good Friday to Easter and to return Sunday
afternoon.
 
80. Mother and [Minor Child] call me and Mother stated she
was not sending [Minor Child] back.
 
81. [Minor Child] told me she was tired of me telling her
what to do, tired of "scoldings" and holding her responsible
for getting herself ready for school in the morning.
 
Father also cited to Mother's declaration, in which she stated:
 
24. During [Minor Child's] last visit with me, she was
to return to Oahu on Sunday, April 5, 2015 on the 4:30 p.m.
flight.
 
25. Around noon, we were attending a family gathering.
and [Minor Child], out of the blue, had an emotional
breakdown and began crying uncontrollably.
 
26. She kept saying, "please don't send me back on the
airplane", "I don't want to go back to daddy", "why can't
you fight for me", "call daddy and tell him I'm not coming",
and "you can't make me go on the airplane".
 
27. I immediately called [Father] and informed him of
the situation, and the fact that I was not comfortable
sending her back to Oahu in the state she was in.
 
28. [Father] told me that I needed to stop being her
friend and start being her mother, and hold her accountable
for her actions, and put her on the plane.
 
29. [Father] spoke to [Minor Child] and she expressed
to him why she did not want to return to Oahu and that if he
moved to Kona, that he could not treat her like a bouncy
ball and that she wanted to stay with me.
 
30. [Father] then told [Minor Child], "well baby girl
then you better get ready for court".
 
31. [Father] then spoke to me and told me to put her
on the plane and he would see her in a few hours.
 
32. I hung up and tried to comfort [Minor Child] and
listen to what she wanted to express to me.
 
33. Approximately a half an hour later, I called
[Father] and informed him that I will not be taking her to
the airport, and I will not be sending her back to Oahu.
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Father fails to explain how the First Circuit Family 
Court's FOFs were clearly erroneous. The evidence to which 
Father cites supports the First Circuit Family Court's findings that Minor Child spent Spring Break with Mother and did not want to return to O
'ahu. Based on the record before us, there was 
substantial evidence to support the First Circuit Family Court's FOFs 7 and 8, and Father's argument is without merit. See 
Fisher, 111 Hawai
'i at 46, 137 P.3d at 360. 
D. FOFs 9 and 10
 
Father challenges FOFs 9 and 10, which state:
 
(9) On April 10, 2015, Mother filed a Petition for Paternity
on April 10, 2015 in the Third Circuit (Third Circuit
Petition).
 
(10) On April 24, 2015, Father filed a Petition for
Paternity in the First Circuit (First Circuit Petition).
 
Father's opening brief fails to include any argument as 
to how the First Circuit Family Court clearly erred in its FOFs 9 
and 10. Therefore, we deem Father's arguments waived.2 See 
Kaho'ohanohano v. Dep't of Human Servs., 117 Hawai 'i 262, 297 
n.37, 178 P.3d 538, 573 n.37 (2008) ("This court will disregard a particular contention if the appellant makes no discernible argument in support of that position." (brackets, citation, and internal quotation marks omitted)); see also Hawai
'i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(7) ("Points not argued may be deemed waived.").
E. FOF 11
 
Father challenges FOF 11, which states, "(11) Several
 
hearings were held to determine the appropriate venue in [sic] to
 hear issues pertaining to [Minor Child's] custody, including two
 joint hearings with the [Third Circuit Family Court] by
 
2
 The record indicates that Mother's petition for paternity, seeking
custody of Minor Child, was filed on April 9, 2015 in the Family Court of the
Third Circuit (Third Circuit Family Court) and Father's petition forpaternity, also seeking custody of Minor Child, was filed on April 17, 2015 inthe First Circuit Family Court. The dates that the petitions for paternitywere filed are only relevant because they show that Mother filed her petitionwith the Third Circuit Family Court first. To the extent that the filingdates of Mother's petition for paternity and Father's petition for paternitymay be erroneous, we hold that such error is harmless. See Hawai' i Family
Court Rules Rule 61 ("The court at every stage of the proceeding mustdisregard any error or defect in the proceeding that does not affect thesubstantial rights of the parties.").

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
telephone." Father argues, "Contrary to . . . [FOF] 11, custody 
was changed Ex Parte on April 10, 2015 when [the Third Circuit Family Court] granted [Mother's] Ex Parte request for non-removal of the minor child from the County of Hawai
'i that was attached 
to her Motion and Affidavit for Temporary Relief filed on April 10, 2015." 
In support of his contention, Father cites to the Third
 
Circuit Family Court's April 10, 2015 "Order to Show Cause for
 Temporary Relief" (Order to Show Cause), which ordered Father to
 
3
appear before the Third Circuit Family Court  on May 11, 2015 to
explain why the court should not enter orders relating to a
 variety of issues, including the custody of Minor Child. The

 
Order to Show Cause did not change Father and Mother's custody of
 Minor Child, as Father alleges, as it did not award custody to
 either Father or Mother. When the Third Circuit Family Court
 issued its Order to Show Cause, Father and Mother were not yet
 bound by a custody order from either family court.
4 See Hawaii
 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 571-46(a) (Supp. 2015): 
In actions for divorce, separation, annulment, separate
maintenance, or any other proceeding where there is at issue
a dispute as to the custody of a minor child, the court,
during the pendency of the action, at the final hearing, or
any time during the minority of the child, may make an order
for the custody of the minor child as may seem necessary or
proper.
 
The record includes transcripts from two joint hearings 
with the First Circuit Family Court and the Third Circuit Family 
Court held May 14, 2015 and July 2, 2015 to discuss Father's motion requesting the First Circuit Family Court assert jurisdiction over the custody dispute. Therefore, FOF 11 is supported by substantial evidence and is not clearly erroneous. See Fisher, 111 Hawai
'i at 46, 137 P.3d at 360. 
F. FOFs 20-30
 
Father challenges FOFs 20-30, which state:
 
3
 The Honorable Aley K. Auna, Jr. presided.
 
4
 Father also argues that the Third Circuit Family Court's Order to
Show Cause violated his constitutional rights of due process. Because
 
Father's appeal only concerns the First Circuit Family Court's Dismissal
Order, we do not have the authority to review the propriety of the Third
Circuit Family Court's Order to Show Cause.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(20) On June 25, 2015, all parties, including [Minor Child],
appeared as court-ordered for an interview with Court
Officer Barbara Wung Shintani of the First Circuit's Custody
Investigation Unit.
 
(21) Court Officer Shintani's report dated June 26, 2015 and
corrected on July 7,2015, recommended for [Minor Child]
reside with Mother and to have visitation with Father.
 
(22) Mother is now married and is currently pregnant; she is
due to give birth in November 2015.
 
(23) Mother works as a waitress in the Kona area of [Hawai' i 
Island]; her gross monthly income is approximately $1,000.00
per month. 
(24) Father is an entertainer and owns his own company on
O'ahu; his gross monthly income is approximately $7,000.00
per month. 
(25) Mother filed the Third Circuit Petition first in time.
 (26) Father has more financial resources than Mother.
 (27) The issue of convenience of forum was also raised
during the proceedings.
 
(28) The fact that there might be more evidence on O' ahu was 
addressed by Mother's agreement to have evidence on O' ahu 
admitted by stipulation and/or witnesses appearing by
video/phone. 
(29) Father has more resources and flexibility to attend
hearings in Third Circuit.
 
(30) Mother is less able to travel given her financial
situation, her physical condition and soon to have an
infant.
 
Father does not argue that the First Circuit Family
 
Courts FOFs 20-30 were incorrect, but instead he appears to argue
 
that FOFs 20-30 were clearly erroneous because they are based
 upon the custody investigation of Court Officer Barbara Shintani
 of the First Circuit Family Court's Custody Investigation Unit
 (Officer Shintani). Father claims the First Circuit Family Court
 
abused its discretion when it ordered Father, Mother, and Minor
 
Child to undergo a custody investigation with Officer Shintani
 and that the First Circuit Family Court also erred in relying
 upon Officer Shintani's report in its FOFs.
 
The record indicates the First Circuit Family Court and
 
the Third Circuit Family Court ordered an investigation by
 Officer Shintani in the hopes that Father and Mother would reach
 a custody agreement without court intervention, which family
 courts have discretion to do. 
See Turoff v. Turoff , 56 Haw. 51,

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
55, 527 P.2d 1275, 1278 (1974) ("The Family Court has 
considerable discretion in requiring investigations and reports concerning the care, welfare, and custody of any minor child of the parties."); see also HRS § 571-46(a)(4) ("Whenever good cause appears therefor, the court may require an investigation and report concerning the care, welfare, and custody of any minor child of the parties."). During the July 2, 2015 joint hearing, Father did not object to Officer Shintani's report, but relied upon the findings in the report to argue that the custody case should be held in the First Circuit Family Court and that Minor Child should return to O
'ahu for the remainder of her summer 
break. 
"It is the general rule that evidence to which no 
objection has been made may properly be considered by the trier of fact[.]" State v. Manipon, 2 Haw. App. 492, 497, 634 P.2d 
598, 603 (1981). Furthermore, "an issue raised for the first time on appeal will not be considered by the reviewing court." Id.; see also Assoc. Of Apartment Owners of Wailea Elua v. Wailea Resort Co., Ltd., 100 Hawai
'i 97, 107, 58 P.3d 608, 618 (2002) 
("Legal issues not raised in the trial court are ordinarily deemed waived on appeal."). Because Father did not object to Officer Shintani's report below, Father cannot now challenge the First Circuit Family Court's reliance upon the report on appeal. Therefore, the First Circuit Family Court did not err in relying upon Officer Shintani's report in its FOFs 20-30 and its findings were supported by substantial evidence. See Fisher, 111 Hawai
'i 
at 46, 137 P.3d at 360 
II. COLS 4-10
 
Father challenges the First Circuit Family Court's COLs
 
4-10, and the legal framework it utilized in its Dismissal Order.
 
COLs 4-10 provide:
 
(4) The Hawaii Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and
Enforcement Act [(UCCJEA)], codified in HRS [chapter 583A.]
 
(5) Chapter 580A, applies to child custody jurisdiction in
interstate custody cases. HRS Chapter 580A does not apply tointrastate conflicting petitions for paternity. See [Beam v.Beam, 126 Hawai' i 58, 60, 266 P.3d 466, 468, (2011)] ("To
determine jurisdiction in interstate child custodyproceedings, we look to the Hawaii Uniform Child Custody 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act.")
 
(6) HRS Chapter 583A does not apply to intrastate custody
cases nor does it apply to cases involving disputed venue.
 
(7) The instant case does not involve jurisdiction; it
involves disputed venue. The concepts of venue and
jurisdiction are different and "should not be confused."
Alamida v. Morse, 53 Hawaii 398, 401, 495 P.2d 585, 588
(1972). "The requirements of jurisdiction are grounded in
the state's inherent judicial power, while the requirements
of venue are grounded in convenience to litigants." Id.
Jurisdiction is derived from the Hawaii State Constitution,
Article V, Section 1. Id. Venue is "the allocation of
judicial business among the various circuits and it is an
allocation base[d] upon convenience to the parties." Id.
 
(8) The doctrine of forum non conveniens has been described
by the Hawaii Supreme Court courts "as the discretionarypower of a court to decline to exercise a possessedjurisdiction whenever it appears that the cause before itmay be more appropriately tried elsewhere." Lesser v.Boughey, 88 Hawai' i 260, 262, 965 P.2d 802, 804 [(2011)
(citations and internal quotation marks omitted)]. 
(9) "For the doctrine of forum non conveniens to apply, an
alternative forum must exist and the defendant must be
 amenable to process in the alternative forum." Id. An
alternative forum existed in the Third Circuit and [Father]
was amenable to [the] process.
 
(10) The [Dismissal Order], filed July 20,2015 was properly
entered. 
(Brackets, emphases, footnotes, and ellipsis omitted.)
A. UCCJEA
 
Father argues that the First Circuit Family Court
 
should have utilized the "analysis of the [UCCJEA] in child
 
custody related matters involving multiple petitions/orders filed
 in multiple circuits (i.e. intrastate cases)" instead of the
 doctrine of forum non conveniens that Hawai
'i courts use when 
determining issues of forum. According to Father, "the UCCJEA's
 analysis is better utilized when determining venue in intrastate
 child custody related matters."
 
Nothing in the plain language of Hawaii's UCCJEA
 
5
statute, HRS § 583A-207 (2006 Repl.),  indicates that UCCJEA's
5
 HRS § 583A-207 provides, in relevant part:
 
§ 583A-207 Inconvenient forum. (a) A court of this 
State which has jurisdiction under this chapter to make a
child-custody determination may decline to exercise its
jurisdiction at any time if it determines that it is an
inconvenient forum under the circumstances and that a court
 
of another state is a more appropriate forum
. The issue of

9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
jurisdictional framework should apply to intrastate custody
 
disputes. Instead, the framework established in the UCCJEA is
 used "[t]o determine jurisdiction in 
interstate child custody
 
proceedings[.]" Beam v. Beam, 126 Hawai 'i 58, 60, 266 P.3d 466, 
468 (App. 2011) (emphasis added). We decline to broaden the
 scope of the state's UCCJEA statute to require its application to
 intrastate matters where the language of the UCCJEA does not
 provide such. See Peer News LLC v. City & Cty. of Honolulu, 138
 
Hawai
'i 53, 60, 376 P.3d 1, 8 (2016) ("Where the statutory 
language is plain and unambiguous, this court's sole duty is to
 give effect to its plain and obvious meaning."); cf. Seamans v.
 
5(...continued)
inconvenient forum may be raised upon the motion of a party,

the court's own motion, or request of another court.
 
(b) Before determining whether it is an inconvenient
forum, a court of this State shall consider whether it is
appropriate for a court of another state to exercise
jurisdiction. For this purpose, the court shall allow the
parties to submit information and shall consider all
relevant factors, including:
 
(1) 	Whether domestic violence has occurred and is
 likely to continue in the future and which state
could best protect the parties and the child;
 
(2) 	The length of time the child has resided outside
this State;
 
(3) 	The distance between the court in this State and
 the court in the state that would assume
 jurisdiction;
 
(4)	 The relative financial circumstances of the
 parties;
 
(5) 	Any agreement of the parties as to which state
should assume jurisdiction;
 
(6) 	The nature and location of the evidence required
to resolve the pending litigation, including
testimony of the child;
 
(7) 	The ability of the court of each state to decide
the issue expeditiously and the procedures
necessary to present the evidence;
 
(8) 	The familiarity of the court of each state with
the facts and issues in the pending litigation;
and
 
(9) 	The physical and psychological health of the
parties.

Seamans, 37 S.W.3d 693, 696 (Ark. Ct. App. 2001) (holding that 
UCCJEA does not apply to intrastate matters where the court found "no language within the UCCJEA statutory scheme that broadens its application to purely intrastate custody disputes or evidences such legislative intent."); In re Marriage of Yount and Hulse, 122 P.3d 1175, 1178 (Kan. Ct. App. 2005) (holding that "the district court erred in finding it had venue over a post-divorce custody action based on the UCCJEA" where the state's UCCJEA "does not address the determination of venue between the state's district courts"). The First Circuit Family Court's decision to not apply the UCCJEA to Father's intrastate custody dispute was not erroneous. See Fisher, 111 Hawai
'i 41, 46, 137 P.3d at 360 
("[T]he family court's COLs are reviewed on appeal de novo, under the right/wrong standard." (quoting In re Doe, 95 Hawai
'i 183, 
190, 20 P.3d 616, 623 (2001)).
B. Doctrine of Forum Non Conveniens
 
Father argues that the First Circuit Family Court 
abused its discretion when it dismissed Father's petition for paternity and motion requesting the First Circuit Family Court assert jurisdiction based on the doctrine of forum non conveniens. The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has described forum non 
conveniens as "the discretionary power of a court to decline to exercise a possessed jurisdiction whenever it appears that the cause before it may be more appropriately tried elsewhere." Lesser, 88 Hawai
'i at 262, 965 P.2d at 804 (quoting Territory, by 
Bailey v. Gay, 32 Haw. 404, 415-16 (Haw. Terr. 1932)). In order for the doctrine of forum non conveniens to apply, "an alternative forum must exist and the defendant must be amenable to process in the alternative forum." Lesser, 88 Hawai
'i at 262, 
965 P.2d at 804 (quoting Harbrecht v. Harrison, 38 Haw. 206, 210 (Haw. Terr. 1948)); UFJ Bank Ltd. v. Ieda, 109 Hawai
'i 137, 145, 
123 P.3d 1232, 1240 (2005) ("An alternative forum ordinarily exists when all defendants are amenable to service of process in the foreign forum." (emphasis omitted)). 
Here, Father does not dispute that the First Circuit
 
Family Court and the Third Circuit Family Court were both proper
 venues for his custody dispute with Mother. Instead, Father
 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
argues that the First Circuit Family Court erred in deciding
 
that, based on the balance of conveniences, the Third Circuit
 Family Court was the best venue to proceed over Father and
 Mother's custody dispute.
6 The Hawai 'i Supreme Court in Lesser 
held that while the plaintiff's choice of forum is an important
 factor, "if the balance of conveniences suggests that trial in
 the chosen forum would be unnecessarily burdensome for the
 defendant or the court, dismissal is proper." Lesser, 88 Hawai
'i 
at 263, 965 P.2d at 805 (quoting Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno, 454
 U.S. 235, 255 n.23 (1981)). The Lesser court considered various
 public and private interests in determining whether the balancing
 of factors weighed in favor of disturbing the plaintiff's choice
 of forum. See Lesser, 88 Hawai
'i at 263-64, 965 P.2d at 805-06.7  
The First Circuit Family Court's FOFs/COLs weighed
 
public and private interest considerations to conclude that the
 various factors weighed in favor of dismissing Father's custody
 suit. The First Circuit Family Court concluded that, as a public
 interest consideration, "[a]llowing two separate petitions
 involving the same parties and facts [to] proceed in two
 
6
 We note that the doctrine of forum non conveniens generally does
not apply to claims of improper venue. See UFJ Bank Ltd. v. Ieda, 109 Hawai' i 
137, 145, 123 P.3d 1232, 1240 (2005); cf. HRS § 603-37 (1993) (authorizing a
circuit court in a civil case to order a change in venue to another circuit if"it would be more fair and equitable to the parties"). As explained below, weconclude that the First Circuit Family Court did not err in consideringfactors relevant to the forum non conveniens doctrine in deciding to dismissFather's custody suit. 
7
 Father's opening brief argues that Lesser also establishes 
specific private interest factors that the court must consider, specifically"a) the relative ease of access to sources of proof; b) the availability ofcompulsory process for attendance of unwilling witnesses; c) the cost ofobtaining willing witnesses; d) practical problems that make trial case easyand expeditious and inexpensive . . . ." These factors are mentioned as "important considerations" in Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert, 330 U.S. 501, 508(1947), a United States Supreme Court case to which the Lesser court cites. See Lesser, 88 Hawai' i at 262-64, 965 P.2d at 804-06. Nothing in Lesser, 
however, suggests that the Hawai' i Supreme Court intended to adopt the private
interest factors mentioned in Gilbert as the only or most important factors toconsider in the court's "balance of convenience" analysis, as Father suggests.The Lesser court emphasized the importance of court's flexibility in decidingwhether to dismiss a case based on the doctrine of forum non conveniens and cited Piper Aircraft, 454 U.S. at 249-50 for the proposition that "[e]ach caseturns on its facts. If central emphasis were placed on any one factor, theforum non conveniens doctrine would lose much of the very flexibility thatmakes it so valuable." [(internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted)]. See 
also Lesser, 88 Hawai' i at 263, 965 P.2d at 805. Therefore, we reject Father's
suggestion that Lesser intended to adopt the private interests factorsmentioned in Gilbert as the exclusive or most important factors for a court toconsider in applying the doctrine of forum non conveniens.

different courts would violate the principles of judicial economy 
and could promote inconsistent results." In considering the private interests of the parties involved, the First Circuit Family Court found that Mother filed her petition for paternity in the Third Circuit Family Court before Father filed his petition for paternity in the First Circuit Family Court; Father had more financial resources and flexibility to attend hearings on a neighbor island than Mother; Mother was pregnant at the time and due to give birth in November 2015; Officer Shintani recommended Minor Child reside with Mother and have visitation rights with Father; and, even though there was more evidence on O
'ahu, Mother agreed to have the evidence admitted by stipulation 
and witnesses to testify by video or phone.8 
Based on the various public and private interest 
considerations, the First Circuit Family Court's balancing of factors were reasonable. We conclude that the First Circuit Family Court's decision to dismiss Father's custody suit based on its balancing of factors and its consideration of factors relevant to the doctrine of forum non conveniens was not an abuse of discretion. See UFJ Bank Ltd., 109 Hawai
'i at 142, 123 P.3d 
at 1237 ("[I]t is inappropriate to disturb a circuit court's order granting a motion to dismiss the complaint on the grounds of forum non conveniens unless the trial judge committed an abuse of discretion." (citation, internal quotation marks, and emphasis omitted)); see also Lesser, 88 Hawai
'i at 264, 965 P.2d at 806 
(holding that where a trial court dismissed a complaint for forum non conveniens and the court's balancing of private and public factors was reasonable, it would be inappropriate for an appellate court to disturb the trial court's decision). 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Order Denying Motion for
 
the Family Court of the First Circuit to Assert Jurisdiction and
 the Immediate Return of the Minor Child Filed May 1, 2015 and
 
8
 We also note that, although the First Circuit Family Court's
FOFs/COLs did not make any determination as to what venue would be in the best
interest of Minor Child, the First Circuit Family Court's Dismissal Order
explicitly concluded that, "it is in [Minor Child's] best interests for the
Third Circuit to retain jurisdiction in this matter and venue is proper
there."
