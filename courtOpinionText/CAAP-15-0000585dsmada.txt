NO. CAAP-15-0000585
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
PAUL KAUKA CULLEN, aka PAUL KAUKA NAKI,
Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
 
RICHARD PERREIRA and GWENDOLYN H. PERREIRA,
Defendants-Appellees
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(DC-CIVIL NO. 13-1-0122)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
appellate jurisdiction over this appeal by Plaintiff-Appellant
 
Paul Kauka Cullen, also known as Paul Kauka Naki (Appellant
 Cullen), pro se, from an oral decision by the Honorable Adrianne
 N. Heely that appears to be reflected in the July 28, 2015
 district court minutes, because the district court has not yet
 entered an appealable final written order or written judgment on
 the remaining substantive issues in Appellant Cullen's
 January 14, 2013 civil complaint for summary possession and money
 damages in District Court Civil No. 13-1-0122. 
Appellant Cullen is appealing pursuant to Hawaii
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2015).
 
Pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a) (1993), appeals are allowed
in civil matters from all final judgments, orders, or
decrees of circuit and district courts. In district court
 
cases, a judgment includes any order from which an appeal
lies. . . . A final order means an order ending the
proceeding, leaving nothing further to be accomplished. . .
 . When a written judgment, order, or decree ends the
litigation by fully deciding all rights and liabilities of
all parties, leaving nothing further to be adjudicated, the
judgment, order, or decree is final and appealable.
 
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai 'i 425, 426, 984 P.2d 1251, 
1252 (1999) (citations, internal quotation marks, and footnote 
omitted; emphases added). The separate judgment document rule under Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) and 
the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 869 P.2d 1334 (1994), is 
not applicable to district court cases. Consequently, an
order that fully disposes of an action in the district court
may be final and appealable without the entry of judgment on
a separate document, as long as the appealed order ends the
litigation by fully deciding the rights and liabilities of
all parties and leaves nothing further to be adjudicated.
 
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai 'i at 427, 984 P.2d at 1253 
(emphases added). 
Although the district court entered a judgment for 
possession on February 20, 2013, the district court has 
apparently not yet adjudicated the remaining substantive issues regarding whether Appellant Cullen is entitled to an award of money damages. Rule 4(a)(5) of the Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure provides that "[a] judgment or order is entered when it is filed in the office of the clerk of the court." Consequently, a district court's "oral decision is not an appealable order." KNG Corp. v. Kim, 107 Hawai
'i 73, 77, 110 P.3d 397, 401 (2005). 
Although the court minutes might reflect a trial court's oral announcement of a ruling, "a minute order is not an appealable 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
order." Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai 'i 
319, 321 n.3, 966 P.2d 631, 633 n.3 (1998) (emphasis added). "In 
civil cases before the district court, the filing of the judgment in the office of the clerk constitutes the entry of the judgment; and the judgment is not effective before such entry." KNG Corp. 
v. Kim, 107 Hawai
'i at 77, 110 P.3d at 401 (citation, internal 
quotation marks, and brackets omitted). 
On October 19, 2015, the district court clerk filed the
 
record on appeal for appellate court case number CAAP-15-0000585,
 at which time the record on appeal did not contain any written
 order or written judgment that adjudicates the remaining
 substantive issues from Appellant Cullen's January 14, 2013
 complaint. Absent the entry of an appealable written final order
 or written final judgment that finally determines the remaining
 substantive issues in this case, Appellant Cullen's appeal is
 premature and we lack appellate jurisdiction.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
 
case number CAAP-15-0000585 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
