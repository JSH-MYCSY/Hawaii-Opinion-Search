ORDER DENYING FEBRUARY 19, 2016 HRAP RULE 40
MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF FEBRUARY 2, 2016 ORDER

DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Upon review of (1) the February 2, 2016 order 
dismissing appellate court case number CAAP-15-0000585 for lack 
of appellate jurisdiction, (2) Plaintiff-Appellant Paul Kauka Cullen's (Appellant Cullen) February 19, 2016 motion for reconsideration of the February 2, 2016 dismissal order pursuant to Rule 40 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP), 
and (3) the record, it appears that Appellant Cullen did not file his February 19, 2016 HRAP Rule 40 motion for reconsideration NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
within ten days after the filing of the February 2, 2016
 
dismissal order, as HRAP Rule 40(a) expressly requires, and,
 thus, Appellant Cullen's February 19, 2016 HRAP Rule 40 motion
 for reconsideration is untimely under HRAP Rule 40(a). 
Furthermore, it does not appear that we overlooked or
 misapprehended any points of law or fact when we entered the
 February 2, 2016 dismissal order.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellant Cullen's
 
February 19, 2016 HRAP Rule 40 motion for reconsideration of the
 February 2, 2016 dismissal order is denied.
