IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
GREGORY DEAN KAUFMAN, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
MERRILL LINDA KAUFMAN, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(FC-D NO. 13-1-0027)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Merrill Linda Kaufman (Wife)
 
appeals from the July 28, 2015 post-judgment order of the Family
 
Court of the Second Circuit (Family Court)1
 on Wife's post-
judgment motion to clarify the scope of Anthony Ranken's (Ranken)
 disqualification from participating in Wife's mediation of child-
custody issues with her former husband, Plaintiff-Appellee
 Gregory Dean Kaufman (Husband).
 
On appeal, Wife argues the Family Court erred in its 
July 28, 2015 order on Wife's motion for post-decree relief by ordering Wife to participate in mediation with her ex-husband while prohibiting her from discussing any of those issues with Ranken, Wife's then fianc√©, in violation of her right to free speech guaranteed by the United States Constitution and the Hawai
'i State Constitution. 
After reviewing the parties' arguments, the record on
 
appeal, and relevant legal authorities, we resolve Wife's points
 on appeal as follows:

 The Honorable Keith A. Tanaka presided.

Wife has waived any argument that the Family Court's 
July 28, 2015 order violates her constitutional rights because 
she failed to raise this issue below. Hawaii Ventures, LLC v. 
Otaka, Inc., 114 Hawai 'i 438, 500, 164 P.3d 696, 758 (2007) 
(citing Kemp v. State of Hawai 'i Child Support Enf't Agency, 111 
Hawai'i 367, 391, 141 P.3d 1014, 1038 (2006)). 
Moreover, the constitutionality of the Family Court's 
order is not ripe for consideration on plain error review. Bitney v. Honolulu Police Dep't, 96 Hawai
'i 243, 251, 30 P.3d 
257, 265 (2001) (the appellate court will consider "whether consideration of the issue requires additional facts; whether the resolution of the question will affect the integrity of the findings of fact of the trial court; and whether the question is a question of great public importance." (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Jorgensen Co. v. Mark Constr. Inc., 56 Haw. 466, 476, 540 P.2d 978, 985 (1975)). 
However, the Family Court's order was extraordinary 
insofar as it forbade Wife from conferring with Ranken "on any outstanding or unresolved mediated matters" outside of the mediation sessions. While the legislature has authorized the family court to order parties to mediate "subject to terms and conditions imposed by the court," Hawai
'i Family Court Rules 
(HFCR) 53.1,2
 this inherent power is not without limit. 
Generally, the family court possesses wide discretion in
making its decisions and those decisions will not be set
aside unless there is a manifest abuse of discretion. Thus,
[an appellate court] will not disturb the family court's
decisions on appeal unless the family court disregarded
rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial
detriment of a party litigant and its decision clearly
exceeded the bounds of reason.

 HFCR 53.1 states: 
(a) Authority to Order.  The court, sua sponte or upon
motion by a party, may, in exercise of its discretion, order
the parties to participate in a nonbinding Alternative
Dispute Resolution process (ADR or ADR process) subject to
terms and conditions imposed by the court. ADR includes
 mediation or other such process the court determines may be
helpful in encouraging an economic and fair resolution of
all or any part of the disputes presented in the matter.

Fisher v. Fisher, 111 Hawai 'i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 (2006) 
(quoting In re Doe, 95 Hawai 'i 183, 189-90, 20 P.3d 616, 622-23 
(2001)).
 The Family Court did not cite to any authority, and we
 
find none, that authorizes a ban on a party's communications
 
outside of the mediation sessions themselves, even when it might
 not exceed the bounds of reason to exclude non-parties from being
 present at or participating in the mediation. We therefore
 conclude that the strict limitation on Wife's communications with
 Ranken was an abuse of discretion. More specifically, the
 court's prohibition forbidding Wife to speak with Ranken about
 any outstanding or unresolved mediated matters during mutually
 agreed breaks or between mediation sessions, either in person or
 over the telephone or through another medium, constitutes an
 abuse of discretion.
 
For the foregoing reasons, the July 28, 2015 post
 
judgment "Order Re: Defendant's Motion for Post-Decree Relief
 Filed May 26, 2016" entered by the Family Court of the Second
 Circuit is vacated and the matter is remanded for further
 proceedings.
