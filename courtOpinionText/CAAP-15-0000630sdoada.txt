APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 13-1-0503-02 RAN)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Chan, JJ.)
Petitioners-Appellants Maria P. Abello, also known as
Mikaela Primer ( Abello), and Teancum, Inc. (Teancum ) appeal from
the July 30, 2015 Final Judgment (Judgment ) entered in the
Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court ).1
 Abello and Teancum raise a single point of error on
appeal, contending that the Circuit Court erred in affirming
Respondent-Appellee Commissioner of Securities Tung Chan's
(Commissioner Chan ) determination that Abello acted recklessly,
and consequently, in affirming the $50,000 administrative penalty
1The Honorable Rhonda A. Nishimura presided.   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
against Abello for violating Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 485-
25(a)(1).
As a preliminary matter, we note that Commissioner Chan
did not find that Teancum violated HRS § 485-25(a)(1); rather,
Commissioner Chan dismissed that charge as to Teancum. 
Commissioner Chan imposed the $50,000 fine solely on Abello. 
Therefore, Teancum seeks to appeal a decision that was adverse
only to Abello. 
Under HRS § 91-14(a), "[a]ny person aggrieved by a
final decision and order in a contested case . . . is entitled to
judicial review thereof under this chapter[.]"  Here, Teancum was 
not aggrieved by the January 18, 2013 Commissioner's Final Order
on Remand as to Respondents Maria P. Abello and Teancum, Inc.
(2013 Final Order on Remand) due to the lack of actual or
threatened injury.  See AlohaCare v. Ito , 126 Hawai #i 326,
342–43, 271 P.3d 621, 637–38 (2012).  "If a party is found to
lack standing, the court is without subject matter jurisdiction
to determine the action."  Haw. Med. Ass'n v. Haw. Med. Serv.
Ass'n, 113 Hawai# i 77, 94, 148 P.3d 1179, 1196 (2006) (citation
omitted).  Accordingly, Teancum's appeal is dismissed for lack of
subject matter jurisdiction.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve Abello's point of error as follows:
Abello contends that the Circuit Court erred in
affirming Commissioner Chan's finding that Abello possessed a
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
scienter of at least "recklessness" when soliciting the subject
funds. 
"[I]n a civil enforcement action brought by an agency,
a state of mind of at least recklessness must be established to
prove a violation of HRS § 485–25(a)(1)."  Trivectra v. Ushijima ,
112 Hawai #i 90, 104, 144 P.3d 1, 15 (2006).  A party is reckless
when he or she "has intentionally done an act of an unreasonable
character in disregard of a risk known to or so obvious that he
[or she] must be taken to have been aware of it, and so great as
to make it highly probable that harm would follow."  Iddings v.
Mee-Lee, 82 Hawai #i 1, 11, 919 P.2d 263, 273 (1996) (citation
omitted).  Courts interpreting parallel federal securities law
are in accord.  See , e.g., In re NVIDIA Corp. Sec. Litig., 768
F.3d 1046, 1053 (9th Cir. 2014) ("an extreme departure from the
standards of ordinary care, and which presents a danger of
misleading buyers or sellers that is either known to the
defendant or is so obvious that the actor must have been aware of
it.") (citation omitted); S.E.C. v. Carriba Air, Inc., 681 F.2d
1318, 1324 (11th Cir. 1982); G.A. Thompson & Co. v. Partridge ,
636 F.2d 945, 962 (5th Cir. 1981).  
Here, there is evidence in the record that Abello
solicited investments, documented as promissory notes, from
friends and acquaintances whom she later described as poor,
elderly, and trusting.  There is testimony in the record that
Abello told multiple investors that their money would be used for
the development of the National Korean War Museum ( Museum), that
they would get their money back, along with interest of 30 to 50
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
percent, in less than six months, and that the investment was
secure because the money and the interest would be paid back from
federal government grants.  Abello claims that these
representations were based on information and written materials
provided to her by her brother-in-law, Kyle Kopitke (Kopitke ). 
It is undisputed that Abello failed to conduct any inquiry or
investigation whatsoever of the information she allegedly relied
upon and provided to the investors, even though she claimed that
she did not know her sister or Kopitke well.  Abello made no
attempt to verify the alleged source of funding for what might
aptly be described as a get-rich-quick scheme, which was enhanced
by the prospect of honoring veterans and helping the homeless,
even though she provided strong assurances to the investors that
their money was safe because it was backed by the federal
government.  In addition, Abello did so in conjunction with her
incorporation of Teancum, a for-profit corporation which was
supposed to be paid $2.5 million, in $300,000 monthly increments,
for providing land acquisition, fund raising, public relations,
and other services related to the development of the Museum.  The
only explanation Abello provided in her testimony for allegedly
trusting Kopitke was that he was family and that he allegedly had
been a Mormon missionary.
We conclude that Commissioner Chan did not clearly err
in finding that Abello was at least reckless in her use of
information and brochures provided by Kopitke to sell promissory
notes in excess of $342,000 (possibly up to $446,000) to poor,
elderly people who trusted her, with no investigation or
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
verification whatsoever of the scheme or source for repayment.2 
Accordingly, we conclude that the Circuit Court did not err in
affirming the 2013 Final Order on Remand.
The Circuit Court's July 30, 2015 Judgment is affirmed.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, February 8, 2018.

2Therefore, we need not consider whether Abello also should have
known and informed the investors of Kopitke's deceitful character, based on
his false reports to Abello's employer and the Insurance Division of the
Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs ( DCCA).  Nor do we need to address
whether the Circuit Court should have taken judicial notice of a purported
2004 letter complaint from Kopitke to the DCCA, which was not in the record
before the agency, but submitted on appeal to the Circuit Court.
