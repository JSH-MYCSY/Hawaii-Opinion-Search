IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
JANE J.P. LIU, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
DEPARTMENT OF THE MEDICAL EXAMINER, CITY AND
COUNTY OF HONOLULU, Defendant-Appellee
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 15-1-0213)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, and Reifurth and Chan, JJ.)
This case arises from a purported "agency appeal" filed
in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit ("Circuit Court") by
Plaintiff-Appellant, pro se, Jane J.P. Liu from the refusal by
Defendant-Appellee Department of the Medical Examiner, City and
County of Honolulu ("City"), to amend the cause of death stated
on her mother, Ang-Gee Liu's, death certificate from "suicide" to
"homicide" or "undecided."  
On February 27, 2015, the City filed a motion to
dismiss Liu's case ("Motion to Dismiss").  After a hearing, the
Circuit Court1/ granted the Motion to Dismiss on April 27, 2015
("April 27, 2105 Order"), and entered Final Judgment against Liu
on July 21, 2015 ("July 21, 2015 Final Judgment").  Liu filed
what amounted to a motion to reconsider the April 27, 2015 Order,
which the Circuit Court denied on August 19, 2015 ("August 19,
2015 Order").  Liu appeals from the April 27, 2015 Order, the
July 21, 2015 Final Judgment, and the August 19, 2015 Order.  
1/The Honorable Rhonda Nishimura presided.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
We construe Liu to contend that the Circuit Court erred
in granting the City's Motion to Dismiss.  Upon careful review of
the record and the briefs submitted by the parties and having
given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues
raised by the parties, as well as the relevant statutory and case
law, we resolve Liu's contentions as follows and affirm.
The Circuit Court did not err when it granted the
Motion to Dismiss.  The Circuit Court noted at the hearing on the
City's motion that Liu claimed to file an appeal under Hawaii
Revised Statutes ("HRS") chapter 92F ("Uniform Information
Practices Act") from the city medical examiner's decision to list
the cause of death on Liu's mother's death certificate as a
"suicide."  The Circuit Court explained that while Liu wanted to
correct her mother's death certificate, the Uniform Information
Practices Act pertains only to a requester's personal records and
not those of another (or, in this case, the requestor's mother),
and therefore provided no basis upon which the court might order
the City to modify its decision.  
The Circuit Court further explained that Liu had filed
an appeal from the agency's decision under HRS section 91-14,2/
but that chapter 91 appeals pertain only to contested case
proceedings.3/  The court explained that without an underlying
contested case hearing, it lacked jurisdiction under HRS chapter
91 to hear Liu's case.  
On appeal, Liu continues to argue her case on its
merits and asks this court to authorize the amending of her
mother's death certificate.  To invoke the lower court's
2/HRS section 91-14 states, in relevant part:
 
(a)  Any person aggrieved by a final decision and order
in a contested case or by a preliminary ruling of the nature
that deferral of review pending entry of a subsequent final
decision would deprive appellant of adequate relief is
entitled to judicial review thereof under this chapter[.]
Haw. Rev. Stat. ยง 91-14(a) (2012).
3/A "contested case" is defined in HRS chapter 91 as "a proceeding
in which the legal rights, duties, or privileges of specific parties are
required by law to be determined after an opportunity for agency hearing." 
Haw. Rev. Stat. ยง 91-1(5) (2012).  An "agency hearing" is defined as "such
hearing held by an agency immediately prior to a judicial review of a
contested case as provided in section 91-14."  Haw. Rev. Stat. ยง 91-1(6).

jurisdiction under HRS section 91-14, however, Liu must have
participated in a contested case hearing.  See Public Access
Shoreline Hawai #i v. Hawai #i Cty. Planning Comm'n, 79 Hawai# i 425,
431, 903 P.2d 1246, 1252 (1995) (providing the requirements of
HRS section 91-14, which include claimant's invovlement in a
"contested case" hearing); Bush v. Hawaiian Homes Comm'n , 76
Hawai#i 128, 134, 870 P.2d 1272, 1278 (1994) (noting that
appellant needed to satisfy the prerequisite of "participation in
a contested case in order to entitle them to judicial review
pursuant to HRS section 91-14(a)").
Liu does not allege that she participated and the
record reflects that she did not participate in a contested case
hearing before the city medical examiner.  Therefore, the Circuit
Court did not err in granting the City's Motion to Dismiss; and
the April 27, 2015 Order, the July 21, 2015 Final Judgment, and
the August 19, 2015 Order are each affirmed.
