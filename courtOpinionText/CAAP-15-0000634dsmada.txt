IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
RICHARD ELINE, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 15-1-1408)

 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL
 
(By: Foley, Presiding J., Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
Upon review of the record in this appeal, CAAP-15­
0000634, and the Hawai 'i State Judiciary Ho 'ohiki for the 
underlying case, Civil No. 15-1-1408, it appears that: 
(1) On March 16, 2016, the court granted pro se
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Richard Eline's (Appellant) January 19, 2016
 
motion for relief from default of the record on appeal, and
 denied his motion for leave to proceed on appeal in forma
 pauperis without prejudice to him seeking relief in the
 underlying case. The court ordered that within ten days from the
 date of the order, Appellant shall file in the underlying case a
 motion for leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis, or, if
 such motion is not filed, pay the filing fees in the full amount
 to the Supreme Court Clerk's Office. The court cautioned
 Appellant that failure to file a motion for leave to proceed on
 appeal in forma pauperis or pay the filing fees may result in the
 appeal being dismissed;
 
(2) Appellant took no further action in this appeal, 
and the Hawai
'i State Judiciary Ho 'ohiki record for the underlying NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
case indicates Appellant did not seek relief in the circuit
 
court; and
 
(3) An appeal may be dismissed where the record on 
appeal has not been prepared because the appellant failed to pay the required fees or obtain an order allowing the appellant to proceed in forma pauperis. Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
Rule 11(b)(2), (c)(2). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are 
dismissed.
