(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant/Counterclaim-Plaintiff/Appellant/Cross-
Appellee 808 Boats LLC (808 Boats) appealed from the District
 
Court of the First Circuit's (District Court) Judgment entered on
 August 13, 2015.
1 Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellee/
 
Cross-Appellee Arnold Dowling (Dowling), aka Arnold Dowling, Jr.,
 cross-appealed from the same. 
On January 17, 2018, on behalf of Dowling's son, Arnold
 
Dowling III (Dowling III), who is also the trustee under the
 Arnold Dowling, Jr. Trust (the Trust), Dowling's attorney

 The Honorable Melanie May presided. 
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
submitted a "Suggestion of Death" reporting to this court that
 
Dowling died on December 9, 2017.
 
On January 31, 2018, this court issued an order
 
regarding further submissions informing the court of what effect
 Dowling's death has on the pending appeal and whether any person
 intends to file a motion requesting that a personal
 representative of Dowling be substituted as a party.
 
Responses to this court's order were filed by Dowling's
 
attorney on February 23, 2018, and March 12, 2018, the gravamen
 of which was that Dowling's heirs decided not to probate
 Dowling's will and not to seek the appointment of a personal
 representative, but instead requested that this court substitute
 Dowling III, as trustee of the Trust, as the designated successor
 to Dowling in this appellate proceeding.
 
On February 20, 2018, 808 Boats also filed a response
 
to this court's order, arguing that, absent a judicial
 appointment of Dowling III as the personal representative of
 Dowling's estate, Dowling III is not a proper party for
 substitution. 
Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 43(a) 
provides, regarding the substitution of parties: 
(a) Death of a party.  If a party dies after the
notice of appeal is filed, or while the proceeding is
otherwise pending in a Hawai 'i appellate court, that court
may substitute the personal representative of the deceasedparty as a party on motion filed by the representative or byany party. The motion shall be served upon therepresentative in accordance with the provisions of Rule 25.If the deceased party has no representative, any party maysuggest the death on the record, and proceedings shall thenbe had as that court shall direct. If an appellee diesafter entry of the judgment or order in the court or agencyappealed from but before a notice of appeal is filed, an

appellant may proceed as if the death had not occurred.
After the notice of appeal is filed, substitution shall beeffected in the Hawai 'i appellate courts in accordance with
this subsection. If a party entitled to appeal shall diebefore filing a notice of appeal, the notice of appeal maybe filed by the party's personal representative, or, if theparty has no representative, by the party's attorney ofrecord within the time prescribed by these rules. After the notice of appeal is filed substitution shall be effected inthe Hawai 'i appellate courts in accordance with this
subsection. 
In Roxas v. Marcos, 89 Hawai' i 91, 122-23, 969 P.2d 
1209, 1240 (1998), the supreme court held that an heir of an 
undistributed estate is generally not a proper party for substitution, unless he or she has been judicially appointed as the personal representative of the decedent's estate. 
It appears that the deceased party to this action,
 
Dowling, has had no personal representative judicially appointed 
for his estate. Dowling III has presented no authority for the
 proposition that, by virtue of his serving as trustee of the
 Trust, he is a proper party for substitution in this appeal.
 There is no other appellee or cross-appellant. Accordingly, we
 conclude that it is appropriate to dismiss both the appeal and
 cross-appeal herein.
 
For these reasons, 808 Boats' appeal and Dowling's
 
cross-appeal from the District Court's August 13, 2015 Judgment
 are dismissed; this case is remanded to the District Court to
 vacate the August 13, 2015 Judgment.
