Share Trust Dated May 28, 2010, and Wise Keliiaa Nicola, Trustee
 
of the Wise K. Nicola Separate Share's (the Nicola Appellees)
 January 8, 2016 motion to dismiss appellate court case number
 CAAP-15-0000641 for lack of appellate jurisdiction,
 (2) Defendants-Appellants Bradford W. Adams and Ei Rayna K.
 Adams's (the Adams Appellants) January 19, 2016 "Motion to Strike
 Untimely & Erred 1/8/16 Motion to Dismiss 8/31/15 Appeal[,]" and
 (3) the record, it appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction
 over the Adams Appellants' appeal from five interlocutory orders
 that the Honorable Karl K. Sakamoto entered in Civil No. 14-1­002213 (KKS), namely, three interlocutory orders entered on
 July 28, July 31, and August 4, 2015, and two interlocutory
 orders entered on September 2, 2015, because the circuit court
 has not yet reduced these five interlocutory orders to a
 separate, appealable final judgment.
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 641-1(a) (1993 & 
Supp. 2015 authorizes appeals to the Hawai
'i Intermediate Court 
of Appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i 
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." The Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has held that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after 
the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming 
& Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
"Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, 
until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. 
One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai 'i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008)); 
Bailey v. DuVauchelle, 135 Hawai 'i 482, 489, 353 P.3d 1024, 1031 
(2015). Consequently, "[a]n appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote omitted). 
On October 22, 2015, the circuit court clerk filed the 
record on appeal for appellate court case number CAAP-15-0000641, which does not include an appealable final judgment. Although limited exceptions to the final judgment requirement exist under the doctrine in Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848) (the Forgay doctrine), the collateral order doctrine, and HRS § 641-1(b) (1993 & Supp. 2015), the five interlocutory orders that the Adams Appellants are attempting to appeal from do not satisfy the requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine, the collateral order doctrine, or HRS § 641-1(b). See Ciesla v. 
Reddish, 78 Hawai
'i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) (regarding 
the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai
'i 
319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding the three requirements for the collateral order doctrine); HRS § 641-1(b) (regarding the requirements for an appeal from an interlocutory order). Absent an appealable final judgment in Civil No. 14-1­002213 (KKS), we lack appellate jurisdiction over appellate court case number CAAP-15-0000641 and the Adams Appellants' appeal is premature.

Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Nicola
 
Appellees' January 8, 2016 motion to dismiss appellate court case
 
number CAAP-15-0000641 for lack of appellate jurisdiction is
 granted, and appellate court case number CAAP-15-0000641 is
 dismissed.
 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all other pending
 
motions in appellate court case number CAAP-15-0000641 are
 dismissed as moot.
