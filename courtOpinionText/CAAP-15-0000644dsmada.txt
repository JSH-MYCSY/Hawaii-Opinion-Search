ORDER DISMISSING THE APPEAL
 
PURSUANT TO HRAP RULES 11(b)(2) and (c)(2)
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that: 
(1) On August 31, 2015, Defendant-Appellant Richard J.
 
Slezak (Appellant), pro se, filed a notice of appeal in the
 underlying district court case, No. 2DTI-14-024668;
 
(2) That same day, the district court clerk notified
 
Appellant that the filing fee or a motion for leave to proceed on
 appeal in forma pauperis should be paid or filed by September 10,
 2015, or the appeal may be dismissed. Appellant acknowledged
 receipt of the notice of payment of fees and wrote on the notice,
 "I am requesting a fee waiver." Appellant did not provide any

information or documentation to support his request, consistent 
with Hawai 'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 24; 
(3) On September 28, 2015, the appellate clerk re-filed
 
the district court clerk's notice with Appellant's handwritten
 notation as a motion for leave to proceed on appeal in forma
 pauperis;
 
(4) On October 1, 2015, the court denied Appellant's
 
motion for leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis without
 prejudice to him filing, within ten days from the date of the
 order, a motion that complies with HRAP Rule 24;
 
(5) Appellant did not file a motion in response to the
 
October 1, 2015 order;
 
(6) On November 3, 2015, the appellate clerk notified
 
Appellant that the time to docket the record on appeal expired on
 October 30, 2015, the filing and docketing fees had not been
 paid, the record on appeal cannot be prepared without the fees or
 an order authorizing Appellant to proceed on appeal in forma
 pauperis, the matter would be called to the court's attention on
 November 13, 2015, for appropriate action, which may include
 dismissal, and Appellant may file a motion requesting relief from
 default;
 
(7) Appellant did not pay the filing and docketing
 
fees, give security for costs, or take any further action in this
 appeal; and
 
(8) An appeal may be dismissed where the record on
 
appeal has not been prepared because the appellant failed to pay 
the required fees or obtain an order allowing the appellant to
 proceed in forma pauperis. HRAP Rule 11(b)(2), (c)(2).
