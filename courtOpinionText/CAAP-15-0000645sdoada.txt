NO. CAAP-15-0000645
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
 
MITCHELL A. BURGE, Defendant-Appellant
 
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
 
(CR. NO. 14-1-0423)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
Defendant-Appellant Mitchell A. Burge appeals from an
 
Amended Judgment, Guilty Conviction and Probation Sentence,
 entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit ("Circuit
 Court"), on July 30, 2015.
1 After a jury trial, the Circuit
 
Court convicted Burge of one count of Assault in the Third Degree
 ("Assault 3"), in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") ยง
 707-712(1)(a). On appeal, Burge argues that the Circuit Court
 erred in convicting him of Assault 3 as a misdemeanor, rather
 than a petty misdemeanor, where the evidence showed that the
 complaining witness ("CW") engaged in a mutual affray. Burge
 does not argue that there was insufficient evidence to convict
 him of Assault 3. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments they advance and the issues they raise, as well as
 the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Burge's appeal as
 
1/
 The Honorable Colette Y. Garibaldi entered the Amended Judgment.

follows and affirm. 
Considering the evidence in the light most favorable to 
the State, there was sufficient evidence that Burge and the CW 
did not engage in a mutual affray. See Haw. Rev. Stat. ยง 707-712 
(Supp. 2012); State v. Eastman, 81 Hawai 'i 131, 135, 913 P.2d 57, 
61 (1996). The CW testified that she tried to intervene in a scuffle between her boyfriend and a group of men. When she saw her boyfriend getting hit, she screamed "stop" and "Get the F back" and tried to push a few people back in an attempt to keep the crowd from jumping in to the fight. Burge hit her with a closed fist, in the upper area of her face, between her nose and eye, at least once, and she fell down. The CW denied threatening or attempting to hit anyone during the time that she was assaulted. A witness also stated that he did not see the CW hit anyone. 
There was conflicting testimony as to CW's involvement
 
 
in the fight. Nevertheless, 
 
[t]he test on appeal is not whether guilt is established
beyond a reasonable doubt, but whether there was substantial
evidence to support the conclusion of the trier of fact.
 Indeed, even if it could be said . . . that the conviction is
against the weight of the evidence, as long as there is
substantial evidence to support the requisite findings for
conviction, the trial court will be affirmed.
 
State v. Batson, 73 Haw. 236, 248, 831 P.2d 924, 931 (1992) 
(citations omitted). Furthermore, "[w]hen reviewing a jury trial, an appellate court will not pass upon the jury's decisions with respect to the credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence, because this is the province of the jury as the trier of fact." State v. Jhun, 83 Hawai
'i 472, 483, 927 P.2d 
1355, 1366 (1996). 
During its deliberations, the jury was given a Special
 
 
Interrogatory, which read:
 
 
If in the Felony Information, you find [Burge] guilty of
[Assault 3], you must then answer the following question:
 
Did the prosecution prove 
beyond a reasonable doubt that
the fight or scuffle with [CW] was not entered into by
mutual consent? (Your answer to this question must be
unanimous.)
 
The jury answered "Yes." In light of the test on appeal, the
 
deference we afford the jury to weigh the evidence, and the

evidence presented in the case, we affirm.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Amended
 
Judgment, Guilty Conviction and Probation Sentence, entered by
 
the Circuit Court of the First Circuit, on July 30, 2015, is
 affirmed.
