APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT

MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant JLW appeals from the August 3,
 
2015 "Order Denying [JLW's] Motion for Relief And/Or
 
Reconsideration of Order Following Initial Return Hearing on
 [JLW's] Motion For Post-Decree Relief Filed on April 7, 2015 and
 Respondent's Motion For Post-Decree Relief Filed on April 24,
 2015" (Order Denying Relief), entered in the Family Court of the
 
1
Second Circuit  (family court). The Order Denying Relief denies 
JLW's Hawaii Revised Statutes (
HRS) § 584-18 (2006 Repl.) or 
Hawai'i Family Court Rules (HFCR) Rule 60(b) post-judgment motion 
for relief from the orders on JLW's petition for paternity regarding the legal and physical custody of his biological child.

On appeal, JLW contends the family court:
 
(1) violated his right to procedural due process and
 
the Hawaii Family Court Rules governing service of motions in
 advance of hearings by allowing Respondent-Appellee KG to serve
 JLW with her April 24, 2015 "Motion For Post-Decree Relief" (KG's
 
Motion) "only one hour before the hearing on the motion, refusing
 
to grant [JLW] a continuance, entering an order pursuant to [KG's
 
Motion] that affected [JLW's] substantial rights, and then
 further denying [JLW's] motion for reconsideration[;]" and
 
(2) abused its discretion in granting [KG's Motion]
 
"because she failed to establish a material change in
 circumstance or submit competent evidence to support the motion." 
HFCR Rule 6(d) provides in part that, "[a] written
 
motion . . . shall be served not later than 48 hours before the
 time specified for hearing[.]" HFCR Rule 6(d). The same advance
 service rule applies to affidavits or declarations supporting a
 motion. The purpose of the advance service rule is to not only
 provide notice of the motion, but also to give the other parties
 an opportunity to file a response. HFCR Rule 6(d). 
KG did not comply with the service requirements of HFCR
 
Rule 6. "[JLW] was personally served with the [KG Motion] at
 2145 Main Street, Wailuku, HI 96793 on the date of the hearing,
 approximately one hour before the parties entered the
 courtroom[.]" At the start of the April 28, 2015 hearing, JLW
 notified the family court that he was not served with notice of
 KG's Motion until right before the hearing began, and requested a
 continuance:
 
[JLW]: Your Honor, if I may, I filed my motion over
two weeks ago.

 
THE COURT:  You filed it on April 7th.
 
[JLW]: Yeah, satisfying due process for them to

prepare this motion that [KG's attorney] has filed, which is
59 pages with over 65 declarations, was literally thrown at
me – bounced off my chest, landed on the floor – at 12 –
excuse me – at 10:01 this morning. It is not possible for me
to even read what's in this motion.
 
I'm asking for a continuance on this motion. But since

she was given due process and I had to fly from out of state
to represent the motion that was already on the docket, I

ask that we move forward with my motion and hearing, and we
can postpone and reschedule hers for another time.
 
In response, KG argued that she had attempted to serve
 
JLW the Friday before the hearing, but was unable to do so. KG
 
then confirmed the process server had "served [JLW] . . . this
 morning. It was about an hour ago." KG argued that "the hour of
 waiting" was sufficient for JLW to "have some time to read the
 motion." The family court denied JLW's request for continuance,
 stating: "Well, I don't want to spend any more time about
 service. I'm going to go ahead with the motions today. Okay. 
I'm going to deny your request for continuance." The family
 court then proceeded with the hearing on both motions.
 
JLW did not have time to read the 55 page long motion
 
that included voluminous exhibits, and a 67-paragraph
 declaration. The service rule specifically requires advance
 notice of motions so that a party has the opportunity to file a
 response. HFCR 6(d). JLW did not have such an opportunity.
 
In this case, a continuance was requested by JLW
 
because KG in not complying with HFCR Rule 6(d) by untimely
 serving JLW with KG's Motion and supporting papers, JLW was
 deprived of an opportunity to respond. The record indicates KG
 would not have been prejudiced by a continuance and JLW would be
 prejudiced by not continuing the hearing. The family court
 "clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or
 principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment" of
 JLW. Sapp v. Wong, 62 Haw. 34, 41, 609 P.2d 137, 142 (1980).
 
Therefore, the August 3, 2015 "Order Denying
 
Petitioner's Motion for Relief And/Or Reconsideration of Order
 Following Initial Return Hearing on Petitioner's Motion For Post-
Decree Relief Filed on April 7, 2015 and Respondent's Motion For
 Post-Decree Relief Filed on April 24, 2015," entered in the
 Family Court of the Second Circuit is vacated, and this case is
 remanded to the family court for further proceedings consistent
