Upon consideration of the Motion to Withdraw Appeal

 
Without Prejudice (Motion), filed December 9, 2015, by Defendant/
 
Counterclaim Plaintiff/Third-Party Plaintiff/Appellant Michael C.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
(2) Hawai 'i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 42(b) authorizes 
the court to dismiss a docketed appeal upon a motion; and (3) 
Appellant seeks to dismiss the appeal without prejudice because it was "inadvertently" created by the September 2, 2015 order in his related appeal, Deutsche Bank National Trust Company v. Greenspon, No. CAAP-15-0000307, and he did not intend to create a new appeal. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is 
granted in part and the appeal is dismissed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, December 18, 2015.
