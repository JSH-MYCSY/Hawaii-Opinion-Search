STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
TEVIN KEKOA BADON-YUNG, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(FC-CR NO. 14-1-0198)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Tevin Kekoa Badon-Yung (Appellant)
 
appeals from an August 12, 2015 Judgment, Guilty Conviction and
 
Sentence entered in the Family Court of the Third Circuit1
 
(family court). Appellant was convicted of abuse of family or
 
household member in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes § 709­
906 (2014 Repl.).
 
Appellant's sole point on appeal is that the family
 
court erred in precluding Appellant from presenting his opinion
 that the complaining witness (CW) was an untruthful person.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude
 Appellant's appeal is without merit.
 
The family court did not abuse its discretion in
 
excluding the personal opinion of Appellant that CW was an

untruthful person as a needless presentation of cumulative
 
evidence under Hawaii Rules of Evidence Rule 403 (1993).
 
The family court in this bench trial had heard
 
testimony from two defense witnesses that CW had a reputation in
 the community for being untruthful and that their personal
 opinions were that CW was untruthful.
 
In addition, Appellant testified that CW had a
 
reputation in the community for being untruthful. In excluding
 the testimony of Appellant at this bench trial, the family court
 stated the obvious. Referring to Appellant and CW, the family
 court stated: "I would assume that, given the relationship
 between the two of them in these proceedings, um, each is going
 to assume that the other is untruthful since they're telling
 different stories[.]"
 
In any event, assuming the family court erred in
 
excluding the personal opinion of Appellant, the error was
 harmless. The family court found CW more credible than
 Appellant. CW's testimony was consistent with the evidence of
 CW's injuries. Appellant's testimony that CW's injuries were
 self-inflicted was found not to be credible.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the August 12, 2015 Judgment,
 
Guilty Conviction and Sentence entered in the Family Court of the
 Third Circuit is affirmed.
