IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
ANTHONY M. PICKENS, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CR. NO. 14-1-0526)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Anthony M. Pickens (Pickens)
appealed from the Judgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence
(Judgment) entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit1 on
August 18, 2015.  Pickens was convicted of Terroristic
Threatening in the First Degree in violation of Hawaii Revised
Statutes (HRS) ยง 707-716(1)(e) (2014) and Assault Against a Law
Enforcement Officer in the Second Degree in violation of HRS
ยง 707-712.6(1) (2014) and ordered to serve terms of probation for
each count under certain terms and conditions.
On May 27, 2016, Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawaii
(State) filed a suggestion of death, notifying this court that
the State had reason to believe Pickens had died.  Pursuant to
this court's order, Pickens's death was confirmed by his
appellate counsel (Counsel) on October 25, 2016.  Counsel also
represented that neither Pickens's family nor Counsel intend to
seek substitution for Pickens as a party to this appeal.  Counsel
further represented that Pickens's probation officer was unable#NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
to contact the complaining witness in this case and that,
according to the Presentence Diagnosis and Report the State took
the position that restitution "was not applicable."
Insofar as the representatives of both parties agree
Pickens has died during the pendency of his appeal, no motion for
substitution has been filed by any party, there is no order for
restitution at issue, and the State has filed no opposition to
dismissal of the underlying criminal case, we exercise our
discretion to dismiss the appeal as moot, vacate the Judgment,
and dismiss the underlying criminal case.  See State v. Makaila,
79 Hawaii 40, 45, 897 P.2d 967, 972 (1995). #
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is
dismissed as moot, the Circuit Court of the First Circuit's
Judgment entered on August 18, 2015, is vacated, and the
indictment against Pickens in this case is dismissed.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, November 22, 2016.
