IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
ROMMEL A. LATA, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CRIMINAL NO. 14-1-0488)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Rommel A. Lata appeals from the
 
Judgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence entered by the
 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit ("Circuit Court")1 on
 
August 19, 2015. Lata was convicted by a jury on one count of
 Criminal Trespass in the Second Degree, in violation of Hawaii
 Revised Statutes ("HRS") section 708-814(1)(a) (Supp. 2013)
 ("Count 1"), and one count of Promoting a Dangerous Drug in the
 
Third Degree, in violation of HRS section 712-1243(1) (Supp.
 
2
2013)  ("Count 2").
On appeal, Lata does not challenge his conviction on
 
Count 1, but contends that the Circuit Court erred in convicting
 
him on Count 2 because the evidence was insufficient to prove
 each and every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. 
Lata's only specific argument on appeal is that the evidence was

insufficient to prove that he knowingly  possessed cocaine.  
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Lata's point of error as follows and affirm.
 
The appellate courts review the sufficiency of evidence
 
on appeal as follows:
 
[E]vidence adduced in the  trial court must be considered in
the strongest light for the prosecution when the appellate
court passes on the legal sufficiency of such evidence to
support a conviction; the same standard applies whether the
case was before  a  judge or jury.  The test on appeal is not
whether guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt, but
whether there was substantial evidence to support the
 conclusion of the trier of fact.
 
State v. Richie, 88 Hawai 'i 19, 33, 960 P.2d 1227, 1241 (1998) 
(quoting State v. Quitog, 85 Hawai 'i 128, 145, 938 P.2d 559, 576 
(1997)). "'Substantial evidence' as to every material element of 
the offense charged is credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion." Richie, 88 Hawai
'i at 33, 960 
P.2d at 1241 (quoting State v. Eastman, 81 Hawai 'i 131, 135, 913 
P.2d 57, 61 (1996)). 
Lata contends that the State failed to prove that he
 
knowingly possessed cocaine. This argument is without merit. 
The State was required to prove that Lata was aware that he was
 in possession of a substance and that he was aware that the
 substance was cocaine in any amount. With regard to proving
 state of mind,
 
[g]iven the difficulty of proving the requisite state of
mind by direct evidence in criminal cases, "[w]e have

evidence and reasonable inferences arising from

(c)	 A person acts knowingly with respect to a result of his
conduct when he is aware that it is practically certain his
conduct will cause such a result.

may be read from his acts, conduct and inferences fairly
drawn from all the circumstances.
 
State v. Miller, No. CAAP-11-0000807, 2013 WL 5288975, at *2 
(Hawai 'i App. Sept. 19, 2013) (quoting State v. Stocker, 90 
Hawai'i 85, 92, 976 P.2d 399, 406 (1999)). 
Miller is on point with the facts of this case. In 
Miller, this court held that there was substantial evidence to support the jury's guilty verdict, and we affirmed the defendant's conviction, for promoting a dangerous drug in the third degree, where an officer testified that she found methamphetamine in the defendant's pockets, the officer noted defendant's strange demeanor, and the defendant claimed that the baggie and its contents were rubbish. Miller, 2013 WL 5288975 at 
*2 (stating that it could reasonably be inferred that the defendant knowingly possessed methamphetamine stored in a baggie when she told the arresting officer in a begging tone, "Please, please, it's rubbish," in an apparent attempt to have the officer disregard it); see also State v. Kido, 102 Hawai
'i 369, 379, 76 
P.3d 612, 622 (App. 2003) (finding there was sufficient evidence that the defendant knew that there were drugs in a pipe when he tried to conceal the paraphernalia after being confronted by the police). 
Similarly, here, Honolulu Police Department 
Metropolitan Police Officer James Strombach testified that upon his first confronting Lata, he directed that Lata "have a seat," and asked him for his identification. In response, Lata produced an EBT card, a bank card, and "a ziplock baggie with a whitish crystal-like residue" that was attached to the cards. According to Officer Strombach, "as soon as [Lata] noticed the baggie also, he immediately tried to hide the baggie in his pants . . . kind of tried to stuff it down into his pants." Based on Officer Strombach's testimony, a jury could reasonably infer from the circumstances that Lata knowingly possessed the cocaine when he attempted to conceal the ziplock bag. See State v. Sprattling, 
99 Hawai
'i 312, 317, 55 P.3d 276, 281 (2002) ("[I]t is well-
settled that an appellate court will not pass upon issues

dependent upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight of the 
evidence; this is the province of the [trier of fact]." (quoting State v. Sua, 92 Hawai
'i 61, 69, 987 P.2d 959, 967 (1999))). 
Considering the evidence in the light most favorable to
 
the State, there was substantial evidence for the jury to
 conclude that Lata knowingly possessed the cocaine. 
Therefore, the August 19, 2015 Judgment of Conviction
 
and Probation Sentence entered by the Circuit Court of the First
 Circuit is affirmed.
