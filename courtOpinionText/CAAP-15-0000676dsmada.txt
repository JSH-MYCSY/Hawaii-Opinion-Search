TAMMY C. KINCAID, Petitioner-Appellee, v.
ROLENE C. GUTIERRES, Respondent-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT

ORDER DISMISSING THE APPEAL PURSUANT TO HRAP RULE 30
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
Upon review of the record, it appears that:
 
(1) On September 18, 2015, Respondent-Appellant 
Rolene C. Gutierres (Appellant), pro se, filed a notice of
 appeal;
 
(2) On November 17, 2015, the family court clerk filed
 
the record on appeal, and the appellate clerk notified the
 parties that the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief were
 due on or before November 27, 2015, and December 28, 2015,
 respectively;
 
(3) Appellant failed to file the statement of
 
jurisdiction or request an extension of time;
 
(4) On December 28, 2015, the appellate clerk granted
 
Appellant an extension of time for the opening brief for thirty
 days to January 27, 2016;
 
(5) On January 28, 2016, the court granted Appellant a
 
second extension of time for the opening brief for thirty days to

(6) Appellant failed to file the opening brief, or
 
request an extension of time;
 
(7) On March 1, 2016, the appellate clerk notified 
Appellant that the time for filing the statement of jurisdiction 
and opening brief expired and, pursuant to Hawai 'i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 30, the matter would be called to the court’s attention on March 11, 2016, for appropriate action, which could include dismissal; 
(8) On March 10, 2016, Appellant sought relief from
 
default, a first extension of time for the statement of
 jurisdiction and a third extension of time for the opening brief;
 
(9) On March 23, 2016, the court granted Appellant
 
relief from default, extended the statement of jurisdiction and
 opening brief deadlines to April 4, 2016, and April 22, 2016,
 respectively, with no further extensions of time absent
 extraordinary circumstances. The court cautioned Appellant that
 further default of the opening brief may result in sanctions,
 including dismissal of the appeal, pursuant to HRAP Rule 30;
 
(10) Appellant failed to file the statement of
 
jurisdiction or timely request an extension of time;
 
(11) On April 22, 2016, Appellant filed a motion for a
 
second extension of time for the statement of jurisdiction and
 fourth extension of time for the opening brief;
 
(12) On May 12, 2016, the court granted Appellant
 
relief from default of the statement of jurisdiction, and
 extended the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief due
 dates to May 23, 2016, and June 13, 2016, respectively, with no
 further extensions of time absent extraordinary circumstances. 
The court again cautioned Appellant that further default of the
 opening brief may result in sanctions, including dismissal of the
 appeal;
 
(13) On May 24, 2016, the United States Postal Service
 
returned the May 12, 2016 order as undeliverable as addressed and
 unable to forward. The appellate clerk mailed the May 12, 2016
 order to Appellant at the same address in the record on appeal
 using zip code 96732, and the appellate clerk had mailed several
 
other documents to Appellant at the same address that were not

returned. But every document the court received from Appellant
 
used zip code 96733, although Appellant took no action to correct
 
the record on appeal. Nonetheless, on June 21, 2016, the
 
appellate clerk re-sent the May 12, 2016 order to Appellant at
 the 96733 zip code, and no return mail was received; and
 
(14) Thereafter, Appellant did not file the statement
 
of jurisdiction or opening brief, or take any further action in
 this appeal.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed.
