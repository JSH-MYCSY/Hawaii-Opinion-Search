I. BACKGROUND 
7 
This appeal arises from a dispute over the purchase of 
a used 2009 Shelby Cobra GT500KR, a limited edition of an exotic 
version of a Ford Mustang (Vehicle). On September 22, 2013, after viewing an advertisement on the HFI website, Buyers went to HFI to test-drive the Vehicle. The Vehicle was a used, rare, high-performance racing automobile with a manual transmission and 15,261 miles on it. Buyers claimed they agreed on a purchase price of $40,000.00, but HFI listed the price on the purchase agreement as $41,800.47. 
After test-driving the Vehicle, Buyers purchased it 
with a third-party service contract identified as a PremiumCARE Extended Service Plan, and Guaranteed Auto Protection (GAP) insurance. Buyers executed an Automobile Purchase Agreement and gave a $1,000.00 down payment to HFI. Buyers were aware that they would not receive possession of the Vehicle on September 22, 2013, because they did not have proof that the Vehicle was covered under their motor vehicle insurance policy and, due to financing issues, they would need to sign a new purchase agreement. After executing this first agreement, it was also discovered that the Vehicle was excluded from coverage under the PremiumCARE Extended Service Plan. 
On September 23, 2013, Buyers voluntarily executed a 
second Automobile Purchase Agreement which included the purchase of a different third-party service contract offered by Warranty Solutions covering the Vehicle. Pursuant to the second agreement, Buyers agreed: (1) to purchase the Vehicle with the Warranty Solutions coverage; (2) that the total purchase price for the Vehicle, including GAP insurance and Warranty Solutions Service Plan, was $47,917.28; (3) that the Vehicle was being sold "as is"; and (4) that if Buyers did not accept delivery of the Vehicle, HFI could keep Buyers' $1,000.00 deposit. 
7 Except as noted, these facts are taken from those uncontested
findings issued by the District Court in its Findings of Fact and Conclusions
of Law filed on November 16, 2015. 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
A Buyer's Guide was prominently displayed in the window 
of the Vehicle at the time Buyers inspected and test-drove the 
Vehicle. The Buyer’s Guide is a form that used car dealers are required by Federal law to display on vehicles for sale and provide to buyers. The Buyer’s Guide provides a uniform method for disclosing warranty information. If a warranty is provided, each vehicle part covered by the warranty must be identified on the first page of the Buyer’s Guide. The warranty section on page one of the Buyer’s Guide provided that the Vehicle was being sold "As Is - No Warranty" but also provided a limited warranty for specific systems pursuant to HRS § 481J-2 (2008).  The 
Buyer's Guide listed various major defects which may occur in used cars and contained an explanation  of the meaning of an "as 
is" purchase. Buyers reviewed and signed the Buyer's Guide. Buyers executed numerous documents that included bold-face type explicitly disclosing to Buyers that the Vehicle was being sold "as is". Buyers took possession of the Vehicle on September 23, 2013.

8 HRS § 481J-2, provides, in pertinent part: 
(a) No used motor vehicle shall be sold in this State by a
dealer to a consumer unless accompanied by a writtenwarranty covering the full cost of both parts and labornecessary to repair any defect or malfunction in a partcovered under subsection (c) that impairs the used motorvehicle's safety or use. Defects and malfunctions that affect only appearance shall not be deemed to impair safetyor use for the purposes of this chapter. 
. . . . 
(c) The written warranty shall require the dealer or
its agent to repair or, at the election of the dealer,
reimburse the consumer for the reasonable costs of repairingthe failure of a covered part. Covered parts shall at leastinclude the following items: 
. . . . 
(2) Transmission, including the transmission case,
internal parts, torque converter, gaskets, andseals[.] 
9 "YOU WILL PAY ALL COSTS FOR ANY REPAIRS. The dealer assumes no 
responsibility for any repairs regardless of any oral statements about thisvehicle." 
4 B. Procedural History NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
After taking possession of the Vehicle, Buyers returned 
the Vehicle to HFI with clutch damage. Buyers alleged the HFI 
Finance Manager agreed to cancel the purchase agreement and refund their deposit, and placed a September 26 email he wrote to that effect into evidence. Henry Tabios (Tabios), an "ASE-certified technician" employed by HFI, inspected the Vehicle after it was returned by Buyers. Alfred Costa, who was the prior owner of the Vehicle and traded the Vehicle in to HFI prior to its purchase by Buyers, experienced no problems with the clutch during the time he owned and operated the Vehicle. HFI employees who inspected the Vehicle before it was sold to Buyers did not experience problems with the clutch. HFI offered to pay for half of the repairs for Buyers; Plaintiff declined HFI'S offer and demanded that the sale be rescinded. HFI allowed Buyers to rescind the transaction; however, HFI retained Buyers' $1,000.00 down payment to offset costs to repair the clutch, which exceeded $1,000.00. 
Buyers filed their Complaint against HFI on 
September 15, 2014 
and amended it on January 23, 2015. The 
amended complaint alleged thirteen (13) UDAP claims: (1) HFI highballed Buyers; (2) HFI changed the price; (3) at delivery the clutch was defective and HFI later agreed to repair the clutch; (4) HFI agreed to cancel the sale and refund the $1,000.00 deposit; (5) HFI misrepresented Buyers were required to complete the purchase; (6) HFI misrepresented to Buyers' creditor J.P. Morgan/Chase that the purchase would be completed; (7) HFI was required by HRS § 481J-2(c)  to repair the clutch at no cost to 
Buyers; (8) HFI's description of the Vehicle as "as is" was in conflict of the notice requirement of HRS § 481J-5 (2008);(9) HFI misrepresented that the Warranty Solutions extended 
11 10
10 HRS § 481J-2(c), supra note 8. 
11 HRS § 481J-5(c) provides: 
(c) The failure of a dealer to provide the warranty or
notices required by this chapter or the provision of false
or misleading notices or warranties shall constitute primafacie evidence of an unfair or deceptive act under chapter480. 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
warranty would pay for any and all repairs, and was therefore 
obligated to repair the clutch itself; (10) HFI committed an intentional tort in threatening to report the Vehicle as repossessed; (11) when HFI found more favorable financing it increased the cost of GAP insurance; (12) HFI made misrepresentations to the credit card company when Buyers disputed the charge; and (13) HFI repeatedly telephoned to threaten legal action unless Buyers completed the purchase. Buyers sought $3,000.00 as treble damages for the $1,000.00 deposit, statutory damages of $1,000.00 for each of the remaining twelve (12) UDAP violations, punitive and exemplary damages, reasonable attorney's fees and costs, and any other relief the court deemed just. 
HFI moved for summary judgment. HFI made two arguments 
supporting their position that they were not responsible for repairing the clutch. First, HFI interpreted the HRS § 481J-2(c)(2) statutory warranty to not include the clutch. Second, the Vehicle was sold "as is," the Buyers damaged the clutch, but wanted HFI to pay for the damage. To support this argument, they produced (a) the purchase agreements stating the sale was "as is;" (b) the Buyer's Guide stating the sale was "as is" with the major defects section initialed by the Buyers; (c) a statement from the prior owner that the clutch was not damaged; (d) a Used Vehicle Inspection Checklist that did not identify clutch damage; and (e) the Warranty Solutions extended service contract that excluded clutch damage. 
A hearing was held on February 23, 2015, and the 
Summary Judgment Order was entered on March 24, 2015 in favor of HFI as to nine of the thirteen UDAP claims. The District Court granted summary judgment on Buyers' UDAP claims 1-6, 10, 12, and 13.  The court denied summary judgment on Buyers' claims 7 and 
12
12 It appears that the court denied summary judgment on claim 2 at
the hearing, but the written order granted it. The Buyers argue, 
The clerk's minutes regarding the partial summary judgment
indicate the Court had orally ruled that the claimsregarding misrepresentations and unfair or deceptivepractices in connection with the sale of the car were notbeing dismissed. Both parties submitted proposed orders andobjections to the other side's proposed order. Neither

8, finding an issue of material fact as to whether the Buyers 
understood there to be a warranty on the clutch based on the language in the Buyer's Guide. The court denied summary judgment on claim 9, regarding representations made by HFI in the sale of the Warranty Solutions extended warranty, but granted it to the extent that the fulfillment of the warranty was the responsibility of a third party. The court denied summary judgment on Buyers' claim 11 as to the change in the GAP insurance price. 
Trial was held over three non-consecutive days on the 
remaining UDAP claims. At trial, the primary issue was whether the clutch was a part of the transmission, and therefore covered under the statutory warranty required by HRS § 481J-2(a). 
On April 30, 2015, the District Court heard opening 
statements and took the expert testimony of Buyer's witness Kenneth B. Moniz. Moniz primarily testified that a manual transmission includes a clutch and thus qualified for the statutory warranty, and that the Buyers could not have damaged the clutch in the way described in the short time they possessed the Vehicle. 
On June 25, 2015, the District Court took the testimony 
of Buyers and HFI employees, including HFI Service Advisor Tabios and HFI General Manager Daniel Asao (Asao). 
Buyers testified as 
to the process of purchasing the Vehicle, negotiation, test drives, GAP insurance, extended warranties, inclusion of "as is" provisions, and first purchase agreement. Buyers testified that they returned to HFI to take delivery and complete the second purchase agreement, and incurred expenses in driving from 
Kâne# ohe. Buyers further testified to returning to have the 
Vehicle checked out, and the alleged rescission and post-sale issues. 
12(...continued)
called for dismissal of the Second Count. Only in the
Court's own order does that feature appear. It is not clear from the order, but it may be that the Court had accepted[HFI's] reliance contention. 
However, Buyers do not state they brought this discrepancy to the attention ofthe District Court, nor do they designate it as an error on appeal. 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HFI's witnesses largely attested to the same broad 
facts as the Buyers, with the exception of the clutch's 
condition. The District Court heard expert testimony from Tabios, who testified that the clutch is separate from the manual transmission, and the clutch disc for the Vehicle upon physical examination, appeared to have been burned. Tabios testified that damage to the clutch is usually caused by the driver. Asao testified to the warranty change, and explained the purpose and substance of the Buyer's Guide. 
On July 14, 2015, the trial concluded with the District 
Court ruling against the Buyers on their remaining claims. As to claims 7, 8, and 9, the court found the statutory warranty did not cover the clutch, and even if it did, Buyers did not establish the clutch was damaged at delivery. As to claim 11, the court held that, as the Buyers signed the agreement, they consented to the change in GAP insurance cost. 
On August 13, 2015, the District Court entered the Fees 
and Costs Order. 
The court denied attorney's fees, but granted 
costs in the amount of $1,090.80. The court rejected HFI's attorney's fee request based on HRS § 607-14 regarding fees in actions in the nature of assumpsit, found that Buyers did not seek relief in the nature of assumpsit in this case and concluded that HRS § 480-13  only provided for a prevailing plaintiff's 
attorney's fees. 
13
Buyers' appeal and HFI's cross-appeal followed. 
II. DISCUSSION 
On appeal, although declining to present separate 
arguments regarding each of their points on appeal, Buyers argue the District Court erred in: (1) granting partial summary judgment and ruling that HFI did not engage in UDAP, Buyers did not establish damages or injury, and failed to prove HFI engaged in UDAP; (2) finding that HFI allowed Buyers to rescind the purchase agreement and return the Vehicle to HFI, but that HFI 
13 See supra note 4. 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
retained the $1,000.00 down payment to offset damage to the car; 
(3) finding HFI's actions after the sale of the Vehicle were not UDAP because they took place after the sale; (4) imposing the burden of proof on Buyers to prove the Vehicle was defective prior to delivery; and (5) finding that HFI was justified in keeping the $1,000.00 down-payment for repairs to the Vehicle. In conjunction with these points, Buyers challenge Findings of Fact 28 and 34 and Conclusions of Law 3, 4, 5, and 6.
14 
On cross-appeal, HFI argues the District Court erred in 
denying HFI's request for reasonable attorney's fees under HRS § 607-14, concluding there was "no assumpsit relief sought by [Buyers] in this action." 
14 The challenged findings and conclusions read as follows: 
28. Plaintiffs have failed to sustain their burden of 
proof that the clutch was damaged or otherwise defective at
the time they took possession of the Vehicle onSeptember 23, 2013. 
. . . . 
34. HFI allowed Plaintiffs to rescind the purchase
transaction and return the Vehicle to HFI. However, HFI
retained Plaintiff's $1,000.00 down payment to offset coststo repair the clutch, said repair costs having exceeded$1,000.00. 
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 
. . . . 
3. Similarly, throughout the context of its contacts
with Plaintiffs in September 2013, HFI did not engage in any
act, representation, or omission which misled Plaintiffsregarding the Vehicle and warranty provisions relatedthereto. 
4. Plaintiffs failed to establish that they were
injured in their property and sustained damages due to anyacts, representations, or omissions of HFI. 
5. Plaintiffs failed to sustain their burden of proof
that HFI engaged in any unfair or deceptive trade practicesduring the course of HFI's dealings with Plaintiffs. 
6. HFI was legally justified in retaining Plaintiffs'
$1,000.00 down payment. 
7. If any of the foregoing Findings of Fact should be
considered Conclusions of Law, the Court so concludes. If any of the foregoing Conclusions of Law should be consideredFindings of Fact, the Court so finds.

The Hawai# i Legislature enacted section 480–2 "in broad 
language in order to constitute a flexible tool to stop and 
prevent fraudulent, unfair or deceptive business practices for the protection of both consumers and honest businessmen." Ai v. Frank Huff Agency, Ltd., 61 Haw. 607, 616, 607 P.2d 1304, 1311 (1980), overruled on other grounds by Robert's Hawaii Sch. Bus, Inc. v. Laupahoehoe Transp. Co., 91 Hawai# i 224, 982 P.2d 853

Cmty. Fed. Credit Union v. Keka, 94 Hawai# i 213, 229, 11 P.3d 1, 
17 (2000), in light of the state legislature's intention to "'encourage those who have been victimized by persons engaging in unfair or deceptive acts or practices to prosecute their claim,' thereby affording 'an additional deterrent to those who would practice unfair and deceptive business acts.'" Zanakis–Pico v. Cutter Dodge, Inc., 98 Hawai# i 309, 317, 47 P.3d 1222, 1230

To obtain relief under section 480–13(b)(1), a consumer 
must establish three elements: "(1) a violation of [section] 480–2; (2) injury to the consumer caused by such a violation; and (3) proof of the amount of damages."

Under section 480–2(a), "unfair or deceptive acts or 
practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are unlawful." HRS § 480–2(a). The supreme court has held that "a practice is unfair when it offends established public policy and when the practice is immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers."

 In Courbat v. Dahana Ranch, Inc., the court held "a

brackets omitted). "A representation, omission, or practice is 
considered material if it involves information that is important to consumers and, hence, likely to affect their choice of, or conduct regarding, a product." Id. (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). This inquiry is objective; the test is "whether the act or omission is likely to mislead consumers." Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
The Buyers argument on appeal is essentially that HFI 
committed a series of UDAP in the course of the sale of the Vehicle. Specifically, Buyers allege that HFI, in violation of HRS § 480-2, (1) "highballed" by setting a very high initial asking price; (2) misrepresented that there was no Kelley Blue Book (KBB) value; (3) inflated the price from $40,000.00 to $41,800.47 in the purchase agreements; (4) refused to honor the agreement to cancel the purchase and refund the $1,000.00.00 deposit; (5) misrepresented to lender that Buyers had agreed to accept delivery; (6) threatened to report Buyers to credit reporting agencies that the Vehicle was repossessed; (7) increased the GAP cost from $495 to $695 on second purchase agreement; (8) interfered with the stop-payment order by claiming HFI towed the Vehicle and that Buyers had it for a longer period of time; (9) harassed Buyers by phone; and (10) kept Buyers' down payment. These will be separated into pre-sale and post-sale arguments. 
Buyers' first pre-sale argument is that HFI "tricked 
[them] into thinking they were receiving a fair price by initially demanding an exorbitant amount[,]" which they term highballing. Buyers cite no statutory or case law deeming this a UDAP. Buyers cite Winey v. William E. Dailey, Inc., 636 A.2d 744, 747-48 (Vt. 1993), for the proposition that lowballing is an UDAP. In that case, a building contractor offered a price below what would be required to complete the job to induce the buyer to begin construction and then increased the costs. Id. The facts here are not analogous. The practice of a dealer advertising a high initial asking price cannot be said to be unfair or misleading. In fact, Buyer Lindsey stated in his deposition, that the advertised price was "[s]omething outrageous. I thought 
11 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
it was like [$]50, [$]59,000 maybe or--something stupid." 
However, he acknowledged that he was able to negotiate the price down quickly because he believed "[HFI] knew [the price was] ridiculous." Therefore, because there was no representation or practice that was unfair or likely to mislead a consumer, there was no UDAP. 
Buyers' second pre-sale argument is that HFI 
misrepresented that there was no KBB value for the Vehicle. Buyers cite Davis, which held a dealer committed a UDAP when it misrepresented the KBB trade-in value of a vehicle to induce the transaction. 86 
Hawai# i at 420, 949 P.2d at 1042. At trial, 
Asao testified the Vehicle was the very limited GT500KR "King of the Road" edition of the Ford Mustang Shelby GT500. Buyers point to no evidence in the record establishing that there was a KBB value for the exact model as the Vehicle at the time of their purchase. Therefore, Buyers failed to prove that a misrepresentation was made. 
Buyers' third pre-sale argument is that HFI inflated 
the price from $40,000.00 to $41,800.47 on the purchase agreement. The evidence presented to the District Court was the Buyers' testimony and a negotiation sheet. The negotiation sheet has a wide variety of numbers and strike outs but no clear agreed upon value. Buyers argue that, although they did agree to purchase the Vehicle at the higher base price by signing the agreement, this agreement was obtained by fraud because they trusted HFI to prepare the sales documents with the negotiated amount and HFI had a duty to bring the change in price to their attention. "The general rule of contract law is that one who assents to a contract is bound by it and cannot complain that he has not read it or did not know what it contained." Leong v. Kaiser Found. Hosps., 71 Haw. 240, 245, 788 P.2d 164, 168 (1990). The Buyers signed two different contracts with the base price of the Vehicle set at $41,800.47. The District Court found, and the Buyers do not challenge the finding, that the Buyers voluntarily signed the second agreement. Therefore, there is no misrepresentation or practice that was unfair or likely to mislead a consumer and therefore Buyers did not prove this was a UDAP. 
12 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Buyers' fourth pre-sale argument is that HFI increased 
the price of the GAP insurance without explanation on the second 
purchase agreement. The District Court noted that Buyers had every opportunity to review the documentation and voluntarily signed the second agreement. Indeed, Asao testified that the GAP price increased with the change in financing and was listed on the second purchase agreement. From the record, Buyers did not prove there was a misrepresentation or practice that was unfair or likely to mislead a consumer and there was no UDAP. 
Regarding the post-sale alleged UDAP, where Buyers 
alleged HFI reneged on a promise to cancel the second purchase agreement and to refund their deposit/down payment, the District Court found, in finding #34, that "HFI allowed [Buyers] to rescind the purchase transaction and return the Vehicle to HFI. However, HFI retained [Buyers'] $1,000.00 down payment to offset costs to repair the clutch, said repair costs having exceeded $1,000.00." 
Buyers agree that HFI, through its finance manager, 
agreed to rescission of the purchase transaction but that HFI ultimately kept the down payment. Buyers appear to take issue with the part of the District Court's finding #34 that HFI retained the down payment as an offset for the clutch repair. Related to this issue is Buyer's challenge of the District Court's finding #28 in which it found Buyers failed in their burden of proving that the clutch was damaged or otherwise defective when they took possession of the Vehicle. 
As to the latter, finding #28, HFI presented evidence 
that the prior owner of the Vehicle, who was also a mechanic by trade, had no problems with the clutch, that their employees inspected and road-tested the Vehicle before it was delivered to Buyers and reported no damage to the clutch but when Buyers returned the Vehicle the clutch was "burnt." HFI's certified mechanic testified that a clutch could be damaged by driving for just a few miles. Buyers presented testimony by their expert who opined that it would be "very rare" that the clutch in a car such as the Vehicle would fail after driving it for forty miles, no matter how it was driven. However, this witness also testified that he did not "see anything wearing out in 15,000 miles, no 
13 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
matter how you drove the car." It was for the District Court to 
resolve conflicts in testimony and determine credibility of the respective witnesses. Tamashiro v. Control Specialist, Inc., 97 Hawai# i 86, 92, 34 P.3d 16, 22 (2001). On this record, we cannot 
say that finding #28 was clearly erroneous. Bhakta v. Cnty. of Maui, 109 Hawai
#i 198, 208, 124 P.3d 943, 953 (2005) (findings of 
fact are reviewed for clear error). 
As to finding #34, the District Court apparently found 
that the representation of HFI's finance manager who agreed to "unwind" the deal and return the $1,000.00 down payment constituted an agreement to rescind the purchase agreement, because the court could not have found HFI held the money as an "offset" unless it found the money belonged to Buyers. "Rescission developed as an equitable remedy and has the effect of cancelling, abrogating, or disaffirming a contract; it restores all parties to their status quo positions prior to the agreement. 
Leslie v. Estate of Tavares, 93 Hawai# i 1, 994 P.2d 
1047 (2000)." 
E. Sav. Bank, FSB v. Esteban, 129 Hawai# i 154, 157 
n.5, 296 P.3d 1062, 1065 n.5 (2013). Thus, we interpret the District Court's finding #34 as a finding that the sales contract was rescinded, and although the Buyers would have been entitled to a return of their down payment as a result, that sum was applied to the cost of repairs to the Vehicle for damage to the clutch that occurred after Buyers took delivery.  The District 
Court did not clearly err in so finding. 
15
Regarding the remainder of Buyers' post-sale UDAPs, 
that HFI told their lender Buyers would accept delivery, threatened to report the Vehicle repossessed, interfered with the stop-payment order by making misrepresentations to the credit card company, and threatened legal action by phone to the Buyers: Buyers have traced no line between these alleged UDAP and any harm cognizable under HRS § 480-2 that Buyers have suffered. Therefore, to the extent that any of the remaining 
15 Buyers argue that HFI "never established the value of its claimed
off-set." However, submitted into evidence was the testimony of Tabios and
the exhibit attached to his deposition which showed that the cost of theclutch repairs was $1,110.04. 
14 HFI'S CROSS-APPEAL NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
allegations are UDAP, there is no attendant harm and they are not 
actionable under HRS § 480-2.
On cross-appeal, HFI argues the District Court erred in 
denying HFI's request for reasonable attorney's fees as prevailing party in this litigation under HRS §§ 607-14 and 480-13. 
On appeal, this court reviews the trial court's grant or 
denial of attorneys' fees and costs under the abuse of discretion standard. Price v. AIG Hawai# i Ins. Co., 107 Hawai# i 
 106, 110, 
111 P.3d 1, 5 (2005). "The trial court abuses its discretion if it bases its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence." Id. We start with the concept that the "American Rule" is that each party is responsible for their own litigation expenses, but that an exception to that rule is where there is authority for such an award in a statute, stipulation or agreement. TSA Int'l, Ltd. v. Shimizu Corp., 92 Hawai# i 243, 263, 990 P.2d 713, 733 (1999); 
Hall v. Laroya, 124 Hawai# i 187, 190, 238 P.3d 714. 717 
(App. 2010) ("HRS § 607–14 is a statutory exception to the American Rule.") Whether an action is "in the nature of assumpsit" is "determined from the substance of the entire pleading, the nature of the grievance, and the relief sought[.]" S. Utsunomiya Enters., Inc. v. Moomuku Country Club, 76 Hawai# i 
396, 400, 879 P.2d 501, 505 (1994) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
As the District Court pointed out in its Fees and Costs 
Order, HRS § 480-13 provides for attorney's fees for plaintiffs who obtain judgment in their favor. TSA, 92 
Hawai# i at 264 n.9, 
990 P.2d at 734 n.9. While HRS § 607-14 provides for attorney's fees to the prevailing party for actions in the nature of assumpsit, Buyers' complaint was based solely on alleged UDAP violations and did not plead any contract claims. Therefore, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying HFI its attorney's fees. 
III. CONCLUSION

for Summary Judgment, the August 25, 2015 Judgment, and the
