APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 13-1-2680) 
MEMORANDUM OPINION 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Reifurth and Chan, JJ.) 
In this appeal arising out of a foreclosure action, 
Defendant-Appellant Association of Apartment Owners of Hanohano 
Hale (the AOAO) appeals from the "Judgment Re: Order Granting Plaintiff American Savings Bank, F.S.B.'s Motion for Confirmation of Sale, Directing Distribution of Proceeds, for Writ of      NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Possession and Disposal of Personal Property, Filed April 8, 
2015" (Judgment) entered on August 28, 2015, by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit court).
1 
The Judgment was entered on an order (Order) confirming 
the sale of foreclosed property on which Plaintiff-Appellee American Savings Bank, F.S.B. (ASB) had already obtained a prior judgment on a decree of foreclosure against the AOAO and Defendants-Appellees Marc Dominic De Luca; Evelyn Amy Kurosumi, as Trustee of the Evelyn Amy Kurosumi Revocable Living Trust, dated August 30, 1994; and Martha F. Hironaka, as Successor Trustee of the Sam S. Hironaka Revocable Living Trust, established by the Unrecorded Instrument dated March 7, 1985, as amended and restated (the Other Defendants). 
In the Order, the circuit court ruled that the amount 
of special assessment the AOAO was entitled to collect pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 514B-146 (2006 & Supp. 2017) was zero. On appeal, the AOAO contends that the circuit court erred in its interpretation of HRS § 514B-146 in reaching its conclusion. The AOAO asserts that, following completion of its nonjudicial foreclosure, the Property was still delinquent and the AOAO's lien on the Property remained, and thus, the AOAO was entitled to recover special assessments from ASB, as the purchaser of the delinquent unit.

As discussed below, we affirm. 
I. BACKGROUND 
In October 2013, ASB initiated judicial foreclosure 
proceedings on a condominium unit located in Hau#ula, Hawai# i (the 
Property), pursuant to a mortgage executed by the unit owners, Thomas Charles De Luca and Marc De Luca. On April 3, 2014, the AOAO filed a lien on the Property in the Office of the Assistant Registrar of the Land Court of the State of Hawai# i (Land Court) 
1 The Honorable Bert I. Ayabe presided. 
2 No  party  challenges  the  validity  of  the  nonjudicial  foreclosure 
proceedings.   See  Sakal  v.  Ass'n  of  Apartment  Owners  of  Hawaiian  Monarch,  143 
Hawai #i  219,  426  P.3d  443  (App.  2018).   Accordingly,  we  do  not  address  the  issue 
herein.

pursuant to HRS § 514B-146 for unpaid assessments. 
While ASB's judicial foreclosure proceeding was 
pending, the AOAO initiated and conducted nonjudicial foreclosure 
proceedings. On May 13, 2014, the AOAO recorded in the Land Court a notice of default and intention to foreclose (Doc. No. T-8898207). 
On July 15, 2014, in the judicial foreclosure 
proceedings, ASB filed its Motion for Summary Judgment as to All Claims and All Parties and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure and Order of Sale (MSJ). In its opposition to the MSJ, the AOAO argued that it had a right to a statutory lien and priority with respect to a six-month special assessment pursuant to HRS § 514B-146(g) and (h) (Supp. 2017). At the hearing on the MSJ on October 22, 2014, the circuit court granted the MSJ and held that the AOAO had a right to a special assessment but that the amount could not be determined at that time. 
On November 7, 2014, the AOAO conducted a nonjudicial 
foreclosure auction under power of sale. As the highest bidder, the AOAO purchased the Property for an amount less than the delinquency. On November 20, 2014, the AOAO filed in the Land Court an affidavit of nonjudicial foreclosure under power of sale (Doc. No. T-9089213). On November 25, 2014, the AOAO recorded a quitclaim deed (Doc. No. T-9094229), conveying title to the Property to itself. The AOAO rented out the Property and collected the rental income. 
Subsequently, on March 17, 2015, ASB conducted a public 
auction in its judicial foreclosure at which it was the highest bidder. In a limited memorandum in opposition to ASB's motion to confirm the sale, the AOAO sought to collect six months of special assessments pursuant to HRS § 514B-146(a), (g), (h), and (k) (Supp. 2017). The circuit court ruled that the amount of the special assessment that the AOAO was entitled to collect was zero. 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW 
Statutory interpretation is reviewed de novo  by [the
appellate] court. When construing a statute, our foremost 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
obligation is to ascertain and give effect to the intention
of the legislature, which is to be obtained primarily fromthe language contained in the statute itself. Moreover, itis a cardinal rule of statutory interpretation that, wherethe terms of a statute are plain, unambiguous and explicit,we are not at liberty to look beyond that language for adifferent meaning. Instead, our sole duty is to give effectto the statute's plain and obvious meaning. 
Bhakta v. Cnty. of Maui, 109 Hawai# i 198, 208, 124 P.3d 943, 953 
(2005) (internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets in 
original omitted). 
III. DISCUSSION 
The AOAO argues that HRS § 514B-146(k) (Supp. 2017) 
provides that an association's statutory lien for delinquent assessments is not extinguished by the association's foreclosure. Thus, the AOAO asserts, the Property was still delinquent when ASB purchased it at the judicial foreclosure auction and the AOAO was entitled to collect a special assessment from ASB. The AOAO also contends that, during its ownership of the Property, the regular monthly assessments continued to go unpaid because the AOAO was required to apply any rental proceeds to its lien for delinquent assessments. 
ASB responds that, pursuant to the plain language of 
HRS § 667-102(b) (2016), the AOAO's lien was extinguished upon the nonjudicial foreclosure sale and the property was no longer delinquent. Accordingly, ASB asserts that the AOAO no longer had the right to collect a special assessment because such a right exists only where the unit being purchased at the foreclosure is delinquent. See HRS § 514B-146(g) (Supp. 2017). ASB further argues that once the AOAO became the owner of the Property at the nonjudicial foreclosure sale, the AOAO was responsible for paying the regular monthly assessments and consequently, there were no unpaid assessments for the AOAO to collect. 
The AOAO's primary contention is that it had the right 
to collect from ASB, the purchaser of the Property, a special assessment in an amount worth six months of regular monthly common assessments. In order to reach this conclusion, the AOAO offers its interpretation of various statutory provisions that 
4  
        
  
           
        
          
         NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
are in pari materia as they relate to condominium associations 
and their power to make assessments for regular monthly common 
area expenses. The statutory provisions will be read with reference to each other. HRS § 1-16 (2009) ("Laws in pari materia, or upon the same subject matter, shall be construed with reference to each other. What is clear in one statute may be called in aid to explain what is doubtful in another."). 
An association's right to collect a special assessment 
arises in HRS § 514B-146(g) (Supp. 2017), which provides, in relevant part: 
(g) Subject to this subsection, and subsections (h) and (i),
the board may specially assess the amount of the unpaidregular monthly common assessments for common expensesagainst a mortgagee or other purchaser who, in a judicial ornonjudicial power of sale foreclosure, purchases adelinquent unit[.] 
The parties disagree as to whether, at the time of 
ASB's purchase of the Property at the judicial foreclosure, the 
Property was "delinquent" for purposes of HRS § 514B-146. As ASB concedes, the AOAO had an automatic statutory lien on the Property that arose pursuant to HRS § 514B-146(a)
3 for unpaid 
assessments. The AOAO properly filed the lien in the Land Court on April 3, 2014. Pursuant to HRS § 514B-146(a), the AOAO then elected to pursue nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings following the procedures set forth in HRS §§ 667-91 through 667-104 (2016). HRS § 667-102(b)(3) (2016) provides that, after the affidavit and 
3 HRS § 514B-146(a) (Supp. 2017) provides, in relevant part: 
(a)  All  sums  assessed  by  the  association  but  unpaid  for  the
share  of  the  common  expenses  chargeable  to  any  unit  shall
constitute  a  lien  on  the  unit  with  priority  over  all  other
liens,  except:
.
. . 
(2)  Except  as  provided  in  subsection  (g),  all  sums
unpaid  on  any  mortgage  of  record  that  was  recorded  prior
to  the  recordation  of  a  notice  of  a  lien  by  the
association,  and  costs  and  expenses  including  attorneys'
fees  provided  in  such  mortgages;
. . . .
 
The lien of the association may be foreclosed by action or by
nonjudicial or power of sale foreclosure procedures set forthin chapter 667, by the managing agent or board, acting onbehalf of the association and in the name of the association[.] 
5      
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
conveyance document for a nonjudicial foreclosure are recorded, 
"[t]he lien of the association . . . shall be automatically extinguished from the unit[.]" Based on the plain language of HRS § 667-102(b)(3), the AOAO's election to pursue nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings therefore extinguished its statutory lien for the delinquent assessments. See First Ins. Co. of Hawaii v. A&B Props., 126 Hawai# i 406, 414, 271 P.3d 1165, 1173 (2012) 
("[T]he fundamental starting point for statutory-interpretation is the language of the statute itself." (Citation omitted)). 
However, citing to HRS § 667-103 (2016),
4 the AOAO 
argues that the Property was still delinquent because the AOAO did not recover the full amount of the delinquency at the nonjudicial foreclosure sale. We do not agree with the AOAO's interpretation of HRS § 667-103. Rather, we conclude that HRS § 667-103 relates to the debt personal to the unit owners, unattached to the Property, if the debt is not fully satisfied. This, however, does not affect our conclusion that the AOAO's lien on the Property for unpaid assessments had been extinguished, pursuant to HRS § 667-102(b)(3). In other words, the prior owner's debt to the AOAO could remain but the Property itself was no longer subject to a lien in favor of the AOAO. 
The AOAO also directs us to HRS § 514B-146(k) (Supp. 
2017) as a basis for its contention that the statutory lien it held was not extinguished by the nonjudicial foreclosure. HRS § 514B-146(k) (Supp. 2017) provides, in relevant part: 
(k) After any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure
proceeding in which the association acquires title to theunit, any excess rental income received by the associationfrom the unit shall be paid to existing lien holders based 
4 HRS § 667-103 (2016) provides: 
Except  a s  provided  in  section  667-92(f)(2),  the  recordation  of
both  the  conveyance  document  and  the  affidavit  shall  not
operate  as  full  satisfaction  of  the  debt  owed  by  the  unit
owner  to  the  association  unless  the  sale  proceeds  from  the
unit  or  the  amounts  paid  by  a  purchaser  under  the  special
assessment  permitted  by  section  421J-10.5  or  514B-146  are
sufficient  to  satisfy  the  unit  owner's  debt  to  the
association[.] 
(E
mphasis added). 
6  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
on the priority of lien, and not on a pro rata basis, and
shall be applied to the benefit of the unit owner. For purposes of this subsection, excess rental income shall beany net income received by the association after a court hasissued a final judgment determining the priority of a seniormortgagee and after paying, crediting, or reimbursing theassociation or a third party for: 
(1) The lien for delinquent assessments pursuant to
subsections (a) and (b); 
. . . provided that the lien for delinquent assessments under
paragraph (1) shall be paid, credited, or reimbursed first. 
The AOAO argues that the first sentence of the section 
contemplates that an association foreclosure has occurred, yet subsection (1) still references an association "lien for delinquent assessments." Thus, the AOAO argues, the statutory lien for unpaid assessments must survive the association's foreclosure.
5 We disagree with the AOAO's interpretation of HRS 
§ 514B-146(k). Rather, reading HRS § 514B-146(k)(1) in pari materia with HRS § 667-102(b)(3) – which expressly extinguished 
the lien of the AOAO – we construe HRS § 514B-146(k)(1) as referring to the amount owed for the delinquent assessments that triggered the lien in the first place. In other words, HRS § 514B-146(k) addresses how an association should deal with "excess rental income" after a foreclosure proceeding in which the association acquires title to a unit, and the statute provides for determining excess rental income as net income received by the association after, inter alia, paying, crediting, or reimbursing the association for amounts owed for delinquent assessments. Although subsection (k)(1) refers to "[t]he lien[,]" we do not read that language as intending that a lien continues to exist given the contrary and more specific language in HRS § 667-102(b)(3) providing that "[w]hen both the affidavit 
5 The  AOAO  acknowledges  that  its  interpretation  of  HRS  §  554B-146(k)
is  in  conflict  with  HRS  §  667-102(b)(3),  discussed  supra .   The  AOAO  argues,
however,  that  HRS  §  514B-146(k)  controls  because  it  was  enacted  subsequent  to  HRS
§  667-102(b)(3).   See  Chung  Mi  Ahn  v.  Liberty  Mut.  Fire  Ins.  Co.,  126  Haw.  1,  9,
265  P.3d  470,  478  (2011)  ("In  general,  when  a  conflict  between  two  laws  is
irreconcilable,  the  later  enactment  governs.").   We  decline  to  employ  this
interpretation  and  instead  employ  the  doctrine  of  in  pari  materia  to  construe  the 
statutes  together.  
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and the conveyance document are recorded: . . . [t]he lien of the 
association . . . shall be automatically extinguished from the unit[.]" 
We conclude that the unit was not delinquent for 
purposes of HRS § 514B-146(g) when ASB purchased it via the judicial foreclosure. Accordingly, the AOAO did not have the right to seek a special assessment from ASB. Our conclusion is consistent with the circuit court's initial ruling that the AOAO had the right to a special assessment pursuant to statute, the amount of which could only be determined once ASB purchased the Property at the judicial foreclosure. At the time of the circuit court's ruling, the AOAO's nonjudicial foreclosure had not occurred and the property remained delinquent. Thus, the circuit court was correct in concluding that, at the time, the AOAO had the right to make a claim for a special assessment.
