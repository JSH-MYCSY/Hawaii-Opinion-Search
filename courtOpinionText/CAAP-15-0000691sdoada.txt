SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, and Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
Defendant-Appellant Kevin N. Nakayama, also known as
 
Jason Tanaka, appeals from the September 2, 2015 Judgment of
 
Conviction and Sentence entered by the Circuit Court of the First
 Circuit ("Circuit Court").

Burglary in the Second Degree, in violation of Hawaii Revised
 Statutes ("HRS") section 708-811 (1993).
2/ Nakayama challenges
 
his conviction.
 
On appeal, Nakayama contends that there was
 
insufficient evidence to find him guilty of burglary in the
 
1/ The Honorable Glenn J. Kim presided.

second degree because the State failed to present substantial 
evidence that Nakayama was the individual who unlawfully entered the JTB Ala Moana 
'Oli'Oli Station (" 'Oli'Oli Station"). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments they advance, the issues they raise, and the
 relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Nakayama's point of
 error as follows, and affirm.
 
The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has held that substantial 
evidence is "credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion." State v. Xiao, 123 Hawai
'i 251, 257, 231 
P.3d 968, 974 (2010) (quoting State v. Fields, 115 Hawai 'i 503, 
512, 168 P.3d 955, 964 (2007)) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
Here, there is substantial evidence to support the 
conclusion of the trier of fact. The jury was presented with a surveillance video capturing a male, later identified as Nakayama, on March 12, 2013 in 
'Oli'Oli Station after business 
hours. At the close of business on March 12, 2013, 'Oli'Oli 
Station was locked and secured. After viewing video surveillance from the night 
'Oli'Oli Station was burglarized, Yoko Odo, the 
general manager of the wedding business division of JTB Hawai 'i 
Travel, LLC, located at 'Oli'Oli Station, recognized Nakayama as the man she saw a few days prior at the site, on March 8, 2013, and encouraged Angel Allas, then the corporate property manager for JTB Hawai
'i, Inc., and a Honolulu Police Department officer 
to watch the March 8, 2013 surveillance video. 
Nakayama argues that Odo's written statement shows that
 
she was unsure of her identification of Nakayama as the same
 person that she saw on March 8th and that she observed on the
 March 12th surveillance video. Nakayama points to Odo's written
 statement where she states that Nakayama "might" be the same
 person in the video, however, Odo later clarified that she used
 the word "might" in her written statement because:
 
That was the first time I wrote a statement like those
 
burglary case, then maybe I – I didn't know what kind of
language or explanation is appropriate for the – as a
statement. But I was –- I recognize[d] his face so I was so

sure about he was the same guy. But my statement was maybe
not -- was not explained enough."
 
Odo also identified Nakayama in a photographic lineup on 
March 14, 2013. In addition to Odo's testimony, the jury also watched the surveillance video, and concluded that Nakayama was in fact the individual in the video. State v. Sprattling, 99 
Hawai
'i 312, 317, 55 P.3d 276, 281 (2002) (quoting State v. Sua, 
92 Hawai 'i 61, 69, 987 P.2d 959, 967 (1999)) ("[I]t is well-
settled that an appellate court will not pass upon issues dependent upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence; this is the province of the [trier of fact]."). Accordingly, the evidence adduced at trial in this case, including witness testimony and video footage, was sufficient to enable a person of reasonable caution to conclude that Nakayama was the person who unlawfully entered 
'Oli'Oli Station on March 
12, 2013. See Xiao, 123 Hawai 'i at 257, 231 P.3d at 974 (quoting 
Fields, 115 Hawai 'i at 512, 168 P.3d at 964). 
Therefore, the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence
 
entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit on September 2,
 2015, is affirmed.
