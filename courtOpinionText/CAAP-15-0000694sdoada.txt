NO. CAAP-15-0000694
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
KAYLA MONTGOMERY, also known as RACHAEL EVE THORNTON,
Defendant-Appellee
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CR. NO. 13-1-1013)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Fujise, Acting Chief Judge, Ginoza and Chan, JJ.)
Plaintiff-Appellant State of Hawai #i (State) appeals
from the August 25, 2015 Order Dismissing Case Without Prejudice
Due to Violation of Rule 9, Hawai #i Rules of Penal Procedure
(HRPP) (Order of Dismissal) and the August 27, 2015 Amended Order
Dismissing Case Without Prejudice Due to Lack of Prosecution
(Amended Order of Dismissal), entered in the Circuit Court of the
First Circuit (Circuit Court).1
On appeal, the State argues that the Circuit Court
(1) erred in granting Exodus Bail Bond's (Exodus) Motion to Set-
Aside Bail Forfeiture (Motion to Set-Aside); and (2) abused its
discretion in dismissing this case because (a) Defendant-Appellee
Kayla Montgomery, also known as Rachael Eve Thornton (Montgomery)
was not amenable to service of the bench warrant while she was in
Hawai#i, (b) the delay in executing the bench warrant did not
justify dismissing the case, and consequently (c) it was error to
recall the bench warrant.

After a careful review and due consideration of the
points raised and arguments made by the parties, the record, and
the applicable authority, we resolve the State's points on appeal
as follows:
1. This court has no jurisdiction to review the Order
Granting Surety's Motion to Set Aside Bail Forfeiture (Order
Granting Motion to Set-Aside).  While neither party has raised
jurisdictional issues in this appeal, this court has an
independent obligation to ensure jurisdiction exists State v.
Graybeard, 93 Hawai #i 513, 516, 6 P.3d 385, 388 (App. 2000). 
"The right of appeal in a criminal case is purely statutory and
exists only when given by some constitutional or statutory
provision."  State v. Naititi , 104 Hawai #i 224, 233, 87 P.3d 893,
902 (2004) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted),
overruled on other grounds by State v. Kazanas , 138 Hawai #i 23,
375 P.3d 1261 (2016).  Statutes granting the State a right to
appeal in criminal cases must be strictly construed.  Id.  The
State has cited to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-13(1) and
(2) (2016)2 as authority for jurisdiction over this appeal.  The
State's September 24, 2015 Notice of Appeal, filed twenty-seven
days after the August 28, 2015 Order Granting Motion to Set-
Aside, does not refer to nor attach the Order Granting Motion to
Set-Aside.  Accompanying the Notice of Appeal is a Statement of
the Points of Error State of Hawai #i Intends to Present on the
Appeal, which identifies the intent to challenge only the orders
dismissing this case.  The certificate of service for these
documents show service was made only on the Office of the Public
Defender and not Exodus.
2HRS ยง 641-13(1) and (2) provides, 
By State in criminal cases.   An appeal may be taken by and
on behalf of the State from the district or circuit courts
to the intermediate appellate court, subject to chapter 602,
in all criminal matters, in the following instances:
(1) From an order or judgment quashing, setting
aside, or sustaining a motion to dismiss any
indictment, information, or complaint or any
count thereof;
(2) From an order or judgment sustaining a special
plea in bar or dismissing the case where the
defendant has not been put in jeopardy[.]
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Similarly, the State's Statement of Jurisdiction does
not mention the Order Granting Motion to Set-Aside and cites, as
authority for this appeal, only HRS ยง 641-13(1) and (2). 
Assuming, without deciding, that the State may appeal an order
granting the set aside of a judgment of bail forfeiture, it does
not appear on this record that the State preserved an appeal from
the Order Granting Motion to Set-Aside.  See Chun v. Bd. of Trs.
of the Emps. Ret. Sys., 92 Hawai# i 432, 448, 992 P.2d 127, 143
(2000).
Therefore, we will not consider the State's first point
on appeal.
2. The Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in
dismissing the case for "State's Failure to Prosecute With Due
Diligence."  Montgomery moved to dismiss for a violation of HRPP
Rule 93 at the July 22, 2015 status hearing.  The appellate court
reviews a trial court's ruling on a motion to dismiss under the
abuse of discretion standard.  State v. Lei, 95 Hawai #i 278, 281,
21 P.3d 880, 883 (2001).  "A court abuses its discretion when it
clearly exceeds the bounds of reason or disregards rules or
principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a
party litigant."  Id.  (citation and internal quotation marks
omitted).  "The parameters within which this discretion is
properly exercised requires a balancing of the interest of the
state against fundamental fairness to a defendant with the added
ingredient of the orderly functioning of the court system.  State
v. Mageo, 78 Hawai# i 33, 37, 889 P.2d 1092, 1096 (App. 1995)
(citation, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted).
3HRPP Rule 9, Obtaining the appearance of defendant, provides, in
pertinent part,
(c)  Execution or service and return.
. . . .
(2) TERRITORIAL LIMITS .  The warrant may be executed or the
summons served at any place within the State.
(3) Manner.
(i)  Warrant.   The warrant shall be executed without
unnecessary delay by the arrest of the defendant. . . .  
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Whatever may be said about the time between the
issuance of the bench warrant for Montgomery on November 27, 2013
and when Montgomery was found by Exodus in Massachusetts sometime
before September 30, 2014,4 it is patent in the record that the
State made no attempts to serve the bench warrant thereafter. 
Even after the Circuit Court made clear that it was inclined to
dismiss the case unless good cause was shown for the lack of
execution on the bench warrant on January 7, 2015 and after
Montgomery moved to dismiss at the July 22, 2015 status
conference, the State communicated no attempts to execute nor an
intent to extradite to bring Montgomery back to face sentencing.  
Balancing the interests of the parties and the orderly
functioning of the court system, and taking into account the lack
of any efforts to pursue this prosecution and failure to object
or provide the Circuit Court with any explanation or express any
interest in pursuing this case, we cannot say that the dismissal
of the case was an abuse of discretion.
Based on our decision to affirm the dismissal of this
case, it is unnecessary to address the State's other arguments.
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Circuit Court
of the First Circuit's August 25, 2015 Order Dismissing Case
Without Prejudice Due to Violation of Rule 9, Hawai #i Rules of
Penal Procedure and August 27, 2015 Amended Order Dismissing Case
Without Prejudice Due To Lack of Prosecution.

"specific location" for Montgomery in Massachusetts at the September 30, 2014
continued hearing on Exodus's Motion to Set-Aside.  It is unclear exactly when
that information was obtained by Exodus.
