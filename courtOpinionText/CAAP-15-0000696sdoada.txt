NO. CAAP-15-0000696
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
REBECCA STAPP, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
WAILUKU DIVISION
 
(Case No. 2DCW-13-0001655)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Rebecca Stapp (Stapp) appeals from
 
the First Amended Judgment and Notice of Entry of Judgment
 
(Judgment), entered by the District Court of the Second Circuit,
 Wailuku Division (District Court), on September 17, 2015.
1 After
 
a bench trial, the District Court convicted Stapp of one count of
 Assault in the Third Degree (Assault 3), in violation of Hawaii
 Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707-712(1)(a) (2014).
 
On appeal, Stapp argues that the District Court erred
 
in convicting her (1) where the court lacked jurisdiction over
 the case, which it had previously dismissed without prejudice;
 and, alternatively, (2) based on insufficient evidence.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Stapp's
 appeal as follows:
 
1
 The Honorable Kelsey T. Kawano entered the Judgment.

1. The District Court did not abuse its discretion by
 
denying Stapp's "Motion to Set Aside Conviction and/or for
 
Judgment of Acquittal," brought on the ground that the District
 Court had previously dismissed Case No. 2DCW-13-0001655 without
 prejudice and, thus, the judgment of conviction in that case was
 null and void.
 
On August 23, 2013, in Case No. 2DCW-13-0001655, 
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai
'i (State) charged Stapp by 
Amended Complaint with committing Assault 3, as a principal or accomplice, on or about May 1, 2013, against juvenile Male 1, born in 2011. On the same date, in Case No. 2DCW-13-0001657, the State charged Stapp by Amended Complaint with committing Assault 3, as a principal or accomplice, on or about May 1, 2013, against juvenile Male 2, born in 2011. 
At trial, counsel for the State indicated that a
 
material witness in the case involving juvenile Male 2 was
 unavailable. The court requested the number of the case for
 which the witness was not needed -– meaning the number of the
 case involving juvenile Male 1 -- and counsel incorrectly
 responded "2DCW-001657." Concerned that continuing the case
 involving juvenile Male 2 would implicate Stapp's right to a
 speedy trial, and based on the misinformation provided to it by
 counsel, the District Court issued an order dismissing Case
 No. 2DCW-13-0001655.
 
Trial proceeded in the case involving juvenile Male 1. 
Midway through trial, counsel for the State apprised the court
 that she had provided it with the wrong case number. The
 District Court orally clarified that trial was proceeding in Case
 No. 2DCW-13-0001655 and not Case No. 2DCW-13-0001657, which had
 been dismissed. Stapp did not object. Later, the court issued
 orders of correction.
 
The District Court's issuance of its order of dismissal 
in Case No. 2DCW-13-0001655 rather than Case No. 2DCW-13-0001657 was a clerical error. See Hawai
'i Rules of Penal Procedure 
Rule 36; see also State v. Johnson, 133 Hawai 'i 186, 324 P.3d 
996, SCWC-11-0001015 2014 WL 535739 at *1 (Haw. Feb. 10, 2014) (mem.) (observing that the wrong defendant's name in an order 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
dismissing a charge was a clerical error); and State v. McKnight, 
131 Hawai 'i 379, 398, 319 P.3d 298, 317 (2013). The District 
Court's orders of correction served to reflect the truth, i.e. that the court intended to dismiss Case No. 2DCW-13-0001657 and proceed to trial on Case No. 2DCW-13-0001655. Stapp has not argued she lacked notice that trial was proceeding on the charge involving juvenile Male 1. Moreover, she mounted a vigorous defense at trial and did not object to proceeding in the case involving juvenile Male 1 or move for judgment of acquittal on the ground that the State failed to adduce evidence that she committed the offense against juvenile Male 2. 
2. There was sufficient evidence to support the 
conviction based on the court's findings of fact, none of which Stapp contests in her points on appeal. See HRS § 707-712(1)(a); 
Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(4) and (7); and 
Okada Trucking Co. v. Bd. of Water Supply, 97 Hawai 'i 450, 459, 
40 P.3d 73, 82 (2002) (unchallenged findings of fact are binding on the appellate court). Moreover, there was substantial evidence supporting the court's findings. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the First Amended
 
Judgment and Notice of Entry of Judgment, entered by the District
 Court of the Second Circuit, Wailuku Division, on September 17,
 2015, is affirmed.
