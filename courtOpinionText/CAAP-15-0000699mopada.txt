appeals from an "Order Re: Decision" entered on April 17, 2015,
and an "Order Denying Motion for Entry of Final Judgment and

(Fees/Costs Order) entered on August 31, 2015, in the Family
Court of the First Circuit ( family court).1
In an order issued on March 22, 2012, the family court
determined that it had temporary emergency jurisdiction under
Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 583A-204 (2006).2  In a Decree

the marriage of Father and Defendant-Appellee/Cross-Appellant
M.S. (Mother), awarded sole physical custody of the parties'
child (minor child) to Mother and joint legal custody to both
Mother and Father.3  The following year, on April 4, 2014, the
family court granted Father's post-decree motion seeking to
change physical custody of minor child to Father.4  Around this
same time period, Mother initiated proceedings in Canada and
obtained rulings from a Canadian court that conflicted with the
Hawai#i court's custody ruling.  At Mother's request, a
conference was held between the Hawai# i family court and the
Canadian court pursuant to the Uniform Child-Custody Jurisdiction
and Enforcement Act ( UCCJEA), and in the April 17, 2015 "Order
re: Decision," the Hawai #i family court set aside its prior
custody orders and determined that the Canadian court's orders
were the valid custodial orders.
On appeal, Father contends that the family court erred
in setting aside its prior custody orders, ordering that minor
child be turned over to Mother, and ruling that the Canadian
custody orders were valid.  Father asserts that the family
court's prior orders correctly determined that the Hawai# i family
court had UCCJEA jurisdiction, requirements were not met to end
the Hawai #i family court's jurisdiction, and Mother was allowed
to circumvent prior final orders that she did not appeal.
On cross-appeal, Mother contends that the family court
erred in denying her request for attorney's fees and costs
because it incorrectly: (1) determined that her UCCJEA motion was
not an action seeking enforcement of another state's custody
determination; (2) determined that her attorney's fees motion was
not interrelated with the Hague Convention; and (3) determined
that Father had a good faith basis to rely on the Hawai #i family

court's April 4, 2014 order and that he had no reason to believe
that the April 4, 2014 order and all prior custodial orders by
the Hawai #i family court would be set aside.
For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the family
court's rulings as to both the jurisdictional issue and the
denial of Mother's request for attorney's fees and costs.
I.  Background
In his appeal regarding the family court's setting
aside of its prior custody orders and ruling that the Canadian
court's custody orders are valid, Father does not challenge any
of the family court's findings of fact ( FOF) set forth in the
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law entered on November 23,
2015 (Jurisdiction FOF/COL ).5  Therefore, the findings in the
Jurisdiction FOF/COL are binding on this court.  Bremer v. Weeks,
104 Hawai# i 43, 63, 85 P.3d 150, 170 (2004) ("[F]indings of fact
that are not challenged on appeal are binding on the appellate
court.") (citations and ellipses omitted).
Mother and Father previously lived in Hawaii.  Minor
child was born in Hawai# i in July 2010, and the parties
subsequently moved to Winnipeg, Canada in September 2010.  In
August 2011, the parties returned to Hawaii for a short vacation.
During the trip, on August 18, 2011, Father filed a Complaint for
Divorce in the family court.  Mother contested the family court's
jurisdiction, but, as noted above, the family court determined
that it had temporary emergency jurisdiction under HRS § 583A-
204.  The family court recognized that it was not the home state
of minor child, but because the only existing action was in
Hawai#i and there was the possibility of international travel
with the minor child, the family court took temporary emergency
custody jurisdiction.  As a result of a hearing on September 19,
2011, Mother was awarded temporary sole physical custody of minor
child and lawfully returned to Winnipeg with minor child. #
5 The Jurisdiction FOF/COL was issued by the Honorable Paul T. Murakami.
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
On February 4, 2013, the family court issued the
Divorce Decree awarding Mother sole physical custody of minor
child and both parties joint legal custody.  Father subsequently
filed a post-decree motion seeking physical custody of minor
child.  On March 12, 2014, the family court orally ordered that
physical custody of minor child be changed to Father.
On April 4, 2014, Mother filed an application in a
Winnipeg, Canada court seeking primary care and control of minor
child.  Later that same day, the Hawai# i family court entered a
written order granting Father's post-decree motion for physical
custody of minor child.  On April 11, 2014, the Canadian court
issued an order granting Mother interim custody of minor child
and ordered that minor child remain in the jurisdiction of
Winnipeg, Manitoba pending the determination of the appropriate
jurisdiction to address minor child's permanent custody.  Father
was represented and appeared in the Canadian court.  After a case
conference on April 16, 2014, Father stipulated to an order
allowing him periods of care for minor child in Winnipeg.  In
seeking to have the Canadian court approve the stipulation,
Father admitted that minor child had lived in Hawai #i 5 of the 39
months of his life.  On May 5, 2014, the Canadian court issued
the stipulated visitation order.  On or about May 5, 2014, Father
took minor child across the border to Chicago and onto a plane to
Hawaii.#
On May 29, 2014, the Canadian court determined that
minor child had a real and substantial connection to Manitoba,
Canada, and that minor child did not have a real and substantial
connection to Hawai# i.  On June 3, 2014, the Canadian court
ordered Father to return minor child to Winnipeg forthwith. 
Father apparently sought to appeal in Canada, but his appeal was
later dismissed.
In September 2014, Mother brought an action in the U.S.
District Court for the District of Hawai #i seeking the return of
minor child.  This action was later dismissed by agreement of the
parties.
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
On January 13, 2015, Mother filed in Hawai# i family
court a "Motion for UCCJEA Conference and To Set Aside Divorce
Decree Custodial Provisions & Post Decree Custodial Orders"
(1/13/15 UCCJEA Motion ).  On April 16 and 17, 2015, a hearing was
held on Mother's 1/13/15 UCCJEA Motion.  On the second day of the
hearing, April 17, 2015, a conference was held between the
Hawai#i family court and the Court of the Queen's Bench (Family
Division), Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.  The Canadian court
requested enforcement of its orders and the Hawai #i family court
ruled that the Canadian custodial orders were valid and would be
enforced.  As a result, the "Order Re: Decision" was entered on
April 17, 2015.
On July 13, 2015, Mother filed a motion for attorney's
fees and costs.  On August 12, 2015, Mother filed an amended
motion for fees and costs.  On August 31, 2015, the family court
issued an order denying attorney's fees and costs to Mother.
II.  Father's Appeal
Father contends the family court properly exercised
exclusive and continuing UCCJEA jurisdiction over minor child and
the UCCJEA statutory requirements were not established for the
Hawai#i family court to decide it no longer had jurisdiction. 
The family court initially exercised temporary emergency
jurisdiction under HRS § 583A-204 and Father argues that the
family court subsequently had exclusive and continuing
jurisdiction under HRS § 583A-202 (2006) because HRS § 583A-204
was "supplanted by its later multiple decisions[.]"  With that
presumption, Father contends that the exclusive and continuing
jurisdiction would have ended only if HRS § 583A-202(a)(1) or
(a)(2) was satisfied. 
Mother asserts that the Hawaii family court attained
temporary emergency jurisdiction under HRS § 583A-204 and such
jurisdiction did not "ripen" or become exclusive and continuing
jurisdiction.  Thus, Mother maintains that the family court did
not err in determining that the family court no longer had
jurisdiction when the Canadian court exercised its jurisdiction,#
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
and thus the Hawai# i family court properly set aside its prior
custody orders.
"The existence of jurisdiction is a question of law
that we review de novo under the right/wrong standard.  Questions
regarding subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any stage
of a cause of action."  Lingle v. Hawaii Gov't Emps. Ass'n, #
AFSCME, Local 152 AFL-CIO , 107 Hawai #i 178, 182, 111 P.3d 587,
591 (2005) (citation omitted). "[I]t is well-settled that
subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be conferred upon a court by
agreement, stipulation, or consent of the parties[.]" 
Cvitanovich-Dubie v. Dubie , 125 Hawai #i 128, 141, 254 P.3d 439,
452 (2011) (citation omitted).  Further, "[t]he lack of
jurisdiction over the subject matter cannot be waived by the
parties."  Id.  (citation omitted). 
To determine jurisdiction in interstate6 child custody
proceedings, we look to the UCCJEA, enacted by the Hawai #i
Legislature in 2002 as HRS Chapter 583A.  A Hawai# i court has
temporary emergency jurisdiction under HRS § 583A-204 "if the
child is present in this State and the child has been abandoned
or it is necessary in an emergency to protect the child because
the child, or a sibling or parent of the child, is subjected to
or threatened with mistreatment or abuse."  Otherwise, a Hawai #i
court properly asserts jurisdiction and makes an initial child
custody determination under HRS § 583A-201 (2006), and that court
retains "exclusive, continuing jurisdiction over the
determination" under HRS § 583A-202.  Beam v. Beam, 126 Hawai# i
58, 61, 266 P.3d 466, 469 (App. 2011).  
When Father filed his complaint for divorce in Hawaii,
Father, Mother, and minor child had not been present in Hawai #i
for six (6) months before the commencement of the proceeding.  In
this regard, the family court did not have initial child custody
jurisdiction under HRS § 583A-201, which provides:#
6  Under the UCCJEA, "[a] court of this State shall treat a foreign
country as if it were a state of the United States for the purpose of applying
parts I and II." HRS § 583A-105 (2006). 
6NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
[§583A-201] Initial child-custody jurisdiction .  (a)
Except as otherwise provided in section 583A-204, a court of
this State has jurisdiction to make an initial child-custody
determination only if:
(1) This State is the home state of the child on the
date of the commencement of the proceeding, or
was the home state of the child within six
months before the commencement of the proceeding
and the child is absent from this State but a
parent or person acting as a parent continues to
live in this State;
(2) A court of another state does not have
jurisdiction under paragraph (1), or a court of
the home state of the child has declined to
exercise jurisdiction on the ground that this
State is the more appropriate forum under
section 583A-207 or 583A-208, and:
(A) The child and the child's parents,
or the child and at least one parent
or a person acting as a parent, have
a significant connection with this
State other than mere physical
presence; and
(B) Substantial evidence is available in
this State concerning the child's
care, protection, training, and
personal relationships;
(3) All courts having jurisdiction under paragraph
(1) or (2) have declined to exercise
jurisdiction on the ground that a court of this
State is the more appropriate forum to determine
the custody of the child under section 583A-207
or 583A-208; or
(4) No court of any other state would have
jurisdiction under the criteria specified in
paragraph (1), (2), or (3). 
(b) Subsection (a) shall be the exclusive
jurisdictional basis for making a child-custody
determination by a court of this State.  
(c) Physical presence of, or personal jurisdiction
over, a party or a child shall not be necessary or
sufficient to make a child-custody determination. 
Home state means the "state in which a child lived with
a parent or a person acting as a parent for a period of at least
six consecutive months immediately before the commencement of a
child-custody proceeding."  HRS § 583A-102 (2006).  As explained
in section 2 of the Comment to UCCJEA § 202, "[j]urisdiction
attaches at the commencement of a proceeding."  Beam, 126 Hawai# i
at 61, 266 P.3d at 469.  Thus, the family court in Hawai #i did
not have jurisdiction to make an initial child custody
determination under HRS § 583A-201 because minor child, Mother,
and Father were not present in Hawai #i for at least six
consecutive months before the commencement of the proceeding. 
7NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Because there were no other known filings in another state of the
United States, or foreign country such as Canada, the family
court in Hawai #i invoked temporary emergency jurisdiction under
HRS § 583A-204 to issue its custody orders.
HRS § 583A-204 provides in relevant part:
[§583A-204] Temporary emergency jurisdiction.   (a) A
court of this State has temporary emergency jurisdiction if
the child is present in this State and the child has been
abandoned or it is necessary in an emergency to protect the
child because the child, or a sibling or parent of the
child, is subjected to or threatened with mistreatment or
abuse.   
(b) If there is no previous child-custody
determination that is entitled to be enforced under this
chapter and a child-custody proceeding has not been
commenced in a court of a state having jurisdiction under
sections 583A-201 to 583A-203, a child-custody determination
made under this section remains in effect until an order is
obtained from a court of a state having jurisdiction under
sections 583A-201 to 583A-203. If a child-custody proceeding
has not been or is not commenced in a court of a state
having jurisdiction under sections 583A-201 to 583A-203, a
child-custody determination made under this section becomes
a final determination, if it so provides, and this State
becomes the home state of the child.
(Emphasis added.)  Neither party contends in this appeal that the
family court erred in exercising temporary emergency
jurisdiction, and, as Father points out, prior custody orders
issued based on such jurisdiction were not ultimately challenged
on appeal.7 
Under HRS § 583A-204(b), the family court's temporary
emergency custody orders "remain[ed] in effect until an order is
obtained from a court of a state having jurisdiction under
sections 583A-201 to 583A-203."  Temporary emergency jurisdiction
under the UCCJEA is temporary and limited and does not include
the authority to make permanent custody determinations.  In re
NC, 294 P.3d 866, 876 (Wyo. 2013) (citations omitted).  Moreover,
7  On May 22, 2014, Mother filed a Notice of Appeal seeking review of:
the Hawai #i family court's April 4, 2014 order granting Father's post-decree
motion for physical custody of minor child; and an order issued on April 28,
2014, denying Mother's motion for reconsideration of the April 4, 2014 order. 
However, on August 5, 2014, this court dismissed Mother's appeal for lack of
appellate jurisdiction.  The only other related appeal in Hawai #i is the
instant appeal.
8NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
as set forth in the statute, child custody determinations made
under HRS § 583A-204 become final only "if it so provides, and
this State becomes the home state of the child."
In April 2014, the Canadian court issued interim
custodial orders.  In May 2014, the Canadian court determined
that as of April 14, 2014, minor child had a real and substantial
connection with Canada.  On June 3, 2014, the Canadian court
ordered Father to return minor child to Winnipeg forthwith. 
Subsequently, after Mother filed her 1/13/15 UCCJEA Motion, the
Hawai#i family court and the Canadian court held a teleconference
in April 2015, and the Hawai# i family court set aside its prior
custody orders consistent with the UCCJEA that "a child-custody
determination made under [HRS § 583A-204] remains in effect until
an order is obtained from a court of a state having jurisdiction
under sections 583A-201 to 583A-203."  HRS § 583A-204 (emphasis
added).
We do not agree with the family court's determination
that the orders issued by the Canadian court were the "only
validly issued custodial orders regarding [minor child], as
Canada is considered the 'home state' under HRS § 583A-102."   
Rather, at minimum, when minor child was present in Hawai# i prior
to issuance of the orders from the Canadian court, the Hawai #i
family court properly exercised temporary emergency jurisdiction. 
However, because we agree that the Canadian court had
jurisdiction under HRS § 583A-201 as the minor child's "home
state," once the Canadian court's orders were issued, any validly
entered custody orders by the Hawai #i family court no longer
remained in effect.
In sum, the Hawaii family court did not err in setting
aside its prior custody orders because under HRS § 583A-204(b),
any valid Hawai #i court orders only remained in effect until the
Canadian court, with "home state" jurisdiction over minor child,
issued its custody orders.
#
9NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
III.  Mother's Cross-Appeal
Mother contends that the family court erred in
determining that her 1/13/15 UCCJEA Motion was not an action
seeking enforcement of a custody determination and thus the
family court erred in denying her request for an award of
attorney's fees and costs under HRS § 583A-312 (2006).  
HRS § 583A-3128 is set forth in Part III of Chapter
583A, which is entitled "Enforcement."  HRS § 583A-303(a) (2006)
provides that Hawai #i courts "shall recognize and enforce a
child-custody determination of a court of another state if the
latter court exercised jurisdiction in substantial conformity
with this chapter[.]"  Thus, the UCCJEA enforcement provisions
direct a court to recognize and enforce an existing custody
determination properly entered by a court of another state.
HRS § 583A-312 provides the family court with
discretion in awarding the prevailing party attorney's fees and
costs under Part III of the UCCJEA as it relates to enforcement. 
Thus, we apply an abuse of discretion standard in reviewing
Mother's cross-appeal.  See generally Doe v. Doe , 118 Hawai# i
268, 278, 188 P.3d 782, 792 (App. 2008).
In denying Mother's request for attorney's fees and
costs, the family court noted in its Findings of Fact and
Conclusions of Law issued on November 23, 2015 (Fees/Costs
Findings and Conclusions ), at FOF 42, that Mother had sought fees
and costs "in any manner related" to essentially all aspects of
8  HRS § 583A-312 provides: 
[§583A-312]  Costs, fees, and expenses.  (a) The court
may award the prevailing party, including a state, necessary
and reasonable expenses incurred by or on behalf of the
party, including costs, communication expenses, attorney's
fees, investigative fees, expenses for witnesses, travel
expenses, and child care during the course of the
proceedings, unless the party from whom fees or expenses are
sought establishes that the award would be clearly
inappropriate.
(b) The court may not assess fees, costs, or expenses
against a state unless authorized by law other than this
chapter.
10NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
the parties lengthy litigation beginning with the Complaint for
Divorce.  Clearly, an award for such a broad request is not
appropriate, so instead we focus on fees and costs related to
Mother's 1/13/15 UCCJEA Motion, which sought to have the Hawai# i
family court determine its jurisdiction given the Canadian court
proceedings and orders.
In particular, Mother's 1/13/15 UCCJEA Motion asked the
family court to determine that the family court did not have
proper UCCJEA jurisdiction beyond temporary emergency
jurisdiction under HRS § 583A-204 and requested that the family
court set aside its prior custody orders and custody provisions
of the divorce decree.  In this regard, the family court
concluded, in its Conclusions of Law (COL ) 19 and 20, that
attorney's fees and costs still were not appropriate because:
19. With respect to Defendant's request for an award
of attorneys' fees and costs related to her January 13, 2015
Motion for UCCJEA Conference, Defendant's Motion was not an
action seeking enforcement of a foreign custody
determination or the return of [minor child] to his
"habitual residence."  Rather, it was an attack on the
validity of the prior orders issued in the divorce case.
Specifically, Defendant asked the Family Court to determine
that it had never acquired anything other than temporary
emergency jurisdiction and therefore it should set aside its
prior custody orders.  Accordingly, HRS §583A-312 provides
no basis for an award of attorneys' fees and costs. 
20. Further, both parties were acting based on their
respective beliefs regarding which Court (Canada or Hawai #i)
had jurisdiction.  Plaintiff had a valid order from the
Hawai#i divorce court awarding him custody of [minor child].
Prior to March 12, 2014, Defendant acquiesced to Hawai #i's
exercise of child custody jurisdiction.  Plaintiff had a
good faith basis to rely on the April 4, 2014 Order of this
Court, and had no reason to believe that it (much less all
prior orders) would be set aside.  It would be "clearly
inappropriate" to punish Plaintiff or reward Defendant under
these facts and circumstances.  Each party should be
responsible for his or her own expenses related to
Defendant's January 13, 2015 Motion for UCCJEA Conference.
We do not agree with the conclusion in COL 19 that "HRS
§583A-312 provides no basis for an award of attorneys' fees and
costs" because we believe that Mother's 1/13/15 UCCJEA Motion
could be viewed as seeking enforcement of the Canadian court's
custody orders.  However, for the reasons set forth in COL 20 and
particularly Mother's acquiescence to the Hawai# i family court's
prior custody orders, we hold that it was within the family
11NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
court's discretion to deny Mother's request for attorney's fees
and costs related to her 1/13/15 UCCJEA Motion.
With respect to Mother's other assertions of error
raised in her cross-appeal, we conclude that  Mother fails to
provide any discernable arguments as to why the family court
allegedly erred in denying her requests for attorney's fees and
costs.  In re Guardianship of Carlsmith , 113 Hawai #i 236, 246,
151 P.3d 717, 727 (2007) (noting that this court may "disregard a
particular contention if the appellant makes no discernible
argument in support of that position") (citation, internal
quotation marks, and brackets omitted).
IV.  Conclusion
Based on the above, the "Order Re: Decision" filed on
April 17, 2015, and the "Order Denying Motion for Entry of Final
Judgment and Motion and Amended Motion for Attorneys Fees and
Costs" filed on August 31, 2015, both entered in the Family Court
of the First Circuit, are affirmed as set forth above.
