NANCY E. MCGEE, Plaintiff-Appellant/Appellant,
v. CAMPAIGN SPENDING COMMISSION, STATE OF HAWAII,
CALVIN K.Y. SAY, and FRIENDS OF CALVIN SAY, AN UNINCORPORATED
CANDIDATE COMMITTEE, Defendants-Appellees/Appellees
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 15-1-0491)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
Plaintiff-Appellant-Appellant Nancy E. McGee ( McGee)
appeals from the Order Dismissing [McGee's] Notice of Appeal
Filed on March 19, 2015 ( Dismissal Order ), and the Final Judgment
(Judgment), which were both entered on September 21, 2015, by the
Circuit Court of the First Circuit ( Circuit Court).1
In this secondary appeal, McGee raises three points of
error, arguing that the Circuit Court erred when it:  (1)
dismissed McGee's appeal from Defendant-Appellee-Appellee
Campaign Spending Commission (the Commission's) February 17, 2015
order dismissing McGee's complaint based on the Circuit Court's
1The Honorable Rhonda A. Nishimura presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Hawaii Revised Statutes
(HRS) chapter 91 and HRS chapter 632; (2) failed to reverse the
Commission's ruling due to the Commission's procedural errors and
apparent partiality; and (3) failed to reverse the Commission's
decision on substantive grounds.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, as well as the
relevant statutory and case law, we resolve McGee's points of
error as follows: 
(1) Defendant-Appellee-Appellee Calvin Say ( Say) and
Defendant-Appellee-Appellee Friends of Calvin Say ( Friends of
Say), as well as the Commission, contend that McGee did not have
standing before the Circuit Court because she did not suffer an
injury-in-fact as a result of the Commission's ruling on her
complaint, which alleged that Say's use of campaign funds to
defend a quo warranto  action was prohibited.
(a) McGee contends that she has standing pursuant to
HRS § 91-14(a) (2012), which provides that "[a]ny person
aggrieved by a final decision and order in a contested case . . .
is entitled to judicial review thereof."  An aggrieved party is
one "whose personal or property right has been injuriously or
adversely affected by an agency's action."  Life of the Land,
Inc. v. Land Use Comm'n, 61 Haw. 3, 7, 594 P.2d 1079, 1082
(1979).  "There must be special injury or damage to one's
personal or property rights as distinguished from the role of
being only a champion of causes."  Id. (citation omitted).  
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Furthermore, "'person aggrieved' appears to be
essentially synonymous with someone who has suffered 'injury in
fact.'"  AlohaCare v. Ito , 126 Hawai #i 326, 342, 271 P.3d 621,
637 (2012) (citation omitted).  Whether a party has suffered an
injury-in-fact is determined under a three-part test:  "(1)
whether the person 'has suffered an actual or threatened injury
as a result of the [agency's decision],' (2) whether 'the injury
is fairly traceable to the [agency's decision],' and (3) whether
'a favorable decision would likely provide relief for [the
person's] injury.'"  Id. at 342–43, 271 P.3d at 637–38 (citation
omitted).  "The plaintiff must show a distinct and palpable
injury to himself [or herself.]  The injury must be distinct and
palpable, as opposed to abstract, conjectural, or merely
hypothetical."  Akinaka v. Disciplinary Bd. of Hawaii Supreme #
Court, 91 Hawai #i 51, 55, 979 P.2d 1077, 1081 (1999) (citations
and quotation marks omitted).
In Akinaka , plaintiff Akinaka complained to the Office
of Disciplinary Counsel ( ODC) regarding an opposing party's
attorneys.  Id.  at 54, 979 P.2d at 1080.  When ODC investigated
and declined to take disciplinary action, Akinaka sued in Circuit
Court for (1) declaratory judgment that probable cause existed to
prosecute the opposing attorneys, and (2) an injunction
compelling ODC to bring disciplinary proceedings against the
opposing attorneys.  Id.  The Hawai #i Supreme Court held:
Because of the nature and purpose of our disciplinary
process, we reiterate that Akinaka had no standing to file
his complaint against appellees because (1) Akinaka has no
recognizable interest in the outcome of the ODC's
investigation against Kukahiko's attorneys, and, therefore, 
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(2) Akinaka was not injured by ODC's refusal to institute
disciplinary proceedings against Kukahiko's attorneys.
Id. at 58, 979 P.2d at 1084.  It then continued:
Akinaka's only function, as the complainant, in the
disciplinary process is to supply evidence of the alleged
attorney malfeasance to ODC.  Akinaka has no right to
dictate the course of an investigation or even compel ODC to
take any action on his complaint.  To conclude otherwise, as
Akinaka would have us do, would mean that complainants, who
have no actual stake in the outcome of disciplinary
proceedings, could force ODC to conduct a full-scale
investigation and hearing into every complaint it receives,
regardless of whether that complaint is unfounded or
frivolous.  
Id. at 59, 979 P.2d at 1085 (citations omitted; emphasis added).  
Here, McGee did not suffer a distinct, palpable injury
to herself as a result of the Commission's summary dismissal. 
See id.  McGee had no personal or property right at stake and had
no recognizable interest in the outcome of the Commission's
ruling.  See Life of the Land , 61 Haw. at 7, 594 P.2d at 1082;
Akinaka, 91 Hawai# i at 58, 979 P.2d at 1084.  
Nor are we persuaded by McGee's contention that she was
"aggrieved" and had "informational standing" because, in June
2014, McGee's purported request for a copy of a June 18, 2014
letter from Commission staff to Say was allegedly denied.  McGee
argues that but-for this denial and "other improper procedures,"
she would have been aware of HRS § 11-404 (Supp. 2017)2 and
2HRS § 11-404 provides:
§ 11-404  Initial determination by the commission. 
[When a party files a complaint to the Commission alleging a
campaign spending violation, t]he commission shall promptly
determine, without regard to chapter 91, to:
(1) Summarily dismiss the complaint;
(2) Investigate further;
(3) Make a preliminary determination; or
( (4) Refer the complaint to an appropriate
prosecuting attorney for prosecution under
section 11-411.
(Emphasis added).   
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
applicable administrative rules, and she would have sought
another avenue of recourse.  We reject this argument.  First,
there is no such information request in the record.  Second,
McGee fails to allege sufficiently that her naiveté regarding HRS
§ 11-404 and applicable Hawai #i Administrative Rules was "fairly
traceable" to the Commission's actions.  See AlohaCare , 126
Hawai#i at 342–43, 271 P.3d at 637–38 (citation omitted). 
Instead McGee merely complains that "[t]he Commission's rules
concerning public participation in enforcement were confusing." 
Third, McGee has not alleged a distinct, palpable injury to
herself.  See Akinaka , 91 Hawai #i at 55, 979 P.2d at 1081.  Even
if she had taken another avenue of recourse, McGee would not have
had a cognizable interest in the outcome of that proceeding.  See
Id. at 58, 979 P.2d at 1084.  
We also reject McGee's assertion that she had
"procedural standing" to appeal because she was denied certain
procedural rights, and because she had a concrete interest in Say
and Friends of Say's campaign expenditures and in the
Commission's handling of her complaint. 
In order to establish a procedural injury, a plaintiff
must show that: 
(1) the plaintiff has been accorded a procedural right,
which was violated in some way . . . (2) the procedural
right protects the plaintiff's concrete interests; and (3)
the procedural violation threatens the plaintiff's concrete
interests, thus affecting the plaintiff "personally[.]"
Sierra Club v. Dep't of Transp., 115 Hawaii 299, 329, 167 P.3d
292, 322 (2007) (internal citation omitted).  The "concrete
interest requirement of the procedural standing doctrine 'is#
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
essentially encompassed in the injury-in-fact test.'"  Id. at
330, 167 P.3d at 323 (quoting Sierra Club v. Hawai #i Tourism
Auth., 100 Hawai #i 242, 250 n.14, 59 P.3d 877, 885 n.14 (2002)). 
In Sierra Club v. Dep't of Transp., plaintiffs were able to
establish concrete interests in an environmental assessment being
performed before harbor improvements designed to facilitate a
large inter-island ferry could take place, because one plaintiff
was a paddling coach whose operations would be affected by the
unloading of cars from the ferry, and another plaintiff surfed at
the harbor and was concerned about the ferry's affect on his surf
site.  115 Hawai #i at 330, 167 P.3d at 323.  
Here, the Commission did not deny McGee any procedural
right.  The Commission addressed her agency complaint at a
January 2015 meeting, and after allowing Say and Friends of Say
to file a response, summarily denied McGee's complaint.  McGee
was accorded the full extent of her procedural rights under HRS
§ 11-404.  Moreover, she had no concrete interest at stake.  See
Sierra Club v. Dep't of Transp., 115 Hawai #i at 329, 167 P.3d at
322.  She did not allege how Say and Friends of Say's campaign
expenditures injured her distinctly and palpably.  See Akinaka,
91 Hawai #i at 55, 979 P.2d at 1081.  Nor did she have a concrete
interest affected by the Commission's handling of her complaint. 
McGee was akin to Akinaka, a complainant whose sole role was to
supply evidence of the alleged misconduct, but who did not have
the right to dictate the course of the investigation.  See id.  at
59, 979 P.2d at 1085.  
6NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 For these reasons, we conclude that McGee lacked
standing to appeal to the Circuit Court under HRS § 91-14.
(b) McGee further contends that she had standing
to bring an action pursuant to HRS § 91-7, that she asked the
Circuit Court to alternatively construe her notice of appeal as
an original complaint, and that the Circuit Court erred in
concluding that it did not have jurisdiction over McGee's claim
for relief pursuant to HRS § 91-7 because she had not filed an
original action challenging the validity of the Commission's
rules.  HRS § 91-7 (2015 & Supp. 2017) provides that " [a]ny
interested person may obtain a judicial declaration as to the
validity of an agency rule . . . by bringing an action against
the agency in the circuit court[.]"  (Emphasis added).  An
interested person under HRS § 91-7 need not meet an injury-in-
fact test.  See Asato v. Procurement Policy Bd., 132 Hawai #i 333,
341, 322 P.3d 228, 236 (2014).  An interested person under HRS §
91-7 is anyone whose interests "may" be adversely affected by the
challenged rule.  Id.  at 342, 322 P.3d at 237.  Under this
standard, it appears that McGee has standing to seek a
declaration, pursuant to HRS § 91-7, that the Commission failed
to follow rulemaking procedures under HRS § 91-3 for practices
related to complaints and investigations before the Commission.
Generally, a civil action, such as that under HRS § 91-
7, is commenced "by filing a complaint  with the court."  Hawai# i
Rules of Civil Procedure ( HRCP) Rule 3 (emphasis added). 
However, the supreme court has recognized exceptions in agency
appeals by concluding that the appellate filings with a circuit
7NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
court may sometimes act as complaints to commence original
actions.  See Matter of Eric G. , 65 Haw. 219, 224, 649 P.2d 1140,
1144 (1982); see also Pub. Access Shoreline Haw. v. Haw. County
Planning Comm'n, 79 Hawai #i 425, 430 n.5, 903 P.2d 1246, 1251 n.5
(1995).  
In Matter of Eric G., parents of Eric G. complained
that the State of Hawai# i Department of Education (DOE ) "had not
provided him with a free appropriate public education" as
required by a federal funding statute, the Education For All
Handicapped Children Act (20 U.S.C. § 1401, et seq. ).  65 Haw. at
219-20, 649 P.2d at 1141.  The DOE appointed an impartial
hearings officer, who decided against the DOE.  Id.  at 220, 649
P.2d at 1141.  The DOE then appealed to the Circuit Court, filing
a notice of appeal to commence a "special proceeding."  Id.  The
DOE cited 20 U.S.C. 1415(e)(2) (1990),3 which allowed parties
aggrieved by the decision at the hearing to bring a "civil
action" in court.  Id. at 224, 649 P.2d 1143–44.  
The supreme court held:  
The misdesignation of the action as a "special proceeding,"
the mistaken label of the complaint as a "Notice of Appeal"
. . . do not vitiate the clear statement in the "Notice of
Appeal" that the proceeding below was based in part, at 
320 U.S.C. § 1415(e)(2) (1990) provided in relevant part:
(e) Civil action; jurisdiction
. . . .
 (2) Any party aggrieved . . . shall have the right to bring
a civil action with respect to the complaint presented
pursuant to this section. . . . In any action brought under
this paragraph the court shall receive the records of the
administrative proceedings, shall hear additional evidence
at the request of a party, and, basing its decision on the
preponderance of the evidence, shall grant such relief as
the court determines is appropriate.
8NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
least, on 20 U.S.C. s 1415(e)(2).  Substance controls over
form.  A claim for relief was stated and thus dismissal was
erroneous.
Id. at 224, 649 P.2d 1144 (emphasis added).  
In Pub. Access Shoreline , parties that attempted to
contest the issuance of a Special Management Area use permit
appealed the Hawai #i County Planning Commission's ruling that
they lacked standing.  79 Hawai #i at 430, 903 P.2d at 1251.  In
their appeal to the Circuit Court, they cited HRS § 91-14, but
they also cited HRS § 205A-6,4 which allows a party to sue an
agency for noncompliance with HRS chapter 205A.  Id.   The supreme
court stated:  
[A]ssuming that the primary jurisdiction doctrine does not
apply because the HPC's decision-making process has
concluded and there is no administrative appeal process to
pursue, the circuit courts would appear to have original
jurisdiction under HRS § 205A–6 to hear either a procedural
or substantive challenge to the agency's action.  This would
be the case notwithstanding a particular claimant's
designation of the claim as an "appeal" rather than an
original action.
Pub. Access Shoreline, 79 Hawai #i at 430, n.5, 903 P.2d at 1251,
n.5 (internal citations omitted; emphasis added).  
Here, McGee filed a notice of appeal to the Circuit
Court, in which she stated:
4HRS § 205A-6 (2017) provides in relevant part:
§ 205A-6 Cause of action.   (a) Subject to chapters 661
and 662, any person or agency may commence a civil action
alleging that any agency:
(1) Is not in compliance with one or more of the
objectives, policies, and guidelines provided or
authorized by this chapter within the special
management area and the waters from the
shoreline to the seaward limit of the State's
jurisdiction; or
(2) Has failed to perform any act or duty required
to be performed under this chapter; or
(3) In exercising any duty required to be performed
under this chapter, has not complied with the
provisions of this chapter.

NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that Plaintiff/Appellant NANCY E.
MCGEE, pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stats. §§ 91-7, 91-8, and
91-14, appeal to the Circuit Court of the First Circuit from
the final decision of Defendant-Appellee CAMPAIGN SPENDING
COMMISSION in the Order Dismissing the Complaint filed
February 17, 2015 attached as Exhibit 'W'. 
Thusly, she appealed an agency decision, but also cited
HRS § 91-7,5 which would otherwise allow her to bring a civil
action against the Commission, similar to the circumstances in
Pub. Access Shoreline .  79 Hawai #i at 430 n.5, 903 P.2d at 1251
n.5.  Accordingly, we conclude that McGee had standing to seek
relief pursuant to HRS § 91-7 and that the Circuit Court erred
when it dismissed her claim under HRS § 91-7 because it did not
arise as an original action.
(c) McGee sought a declaratory ruling from the Circuit
Court, under HRS chapter 632, that "Say [and Friends of Say]
violated Campaign Spending rules by misusing funds for prohibited
purposes and personal expenses[.]" 
"HRS ch. 632 is to be 'liberally interpreted and
administered, with a view to making the courts more serviceable
to the people[,]' HRS § 632–6, but nowhere does the law suggest
that this admonition trumps the standing requirement of a
'personal stake' or an 'injury in fact.'"  Bremner v. City & Cty.
of Honolulu, 96 Hawai #i 134, 143, 28 P.3d 350, 359 (App. 2001). 
5Although her Notice of Appeal and Statement of the Case asserted
that the Circuit Court had jurisdiction under § 91-8, McGee's opening brief in
the Circuit Court appeal did not contain any argument regarding HRS § 91-8. 
McGee presents no discernible argument in the instant appeal regarding the
Circuit Court's dismissal of her HRS § 91-8 claims, and thus waived any such
arguments.  See Kakinami v. Kakinami, 127 Hawai #i 126, 144 n.16, 276 P.3d 695,
713 n.16 (2012) (citing In re Guardianship of Carlsmith, 113 Hawai #i 236, 246,
151 P.3d 717, 727 (2007)). 
10NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
In order to have standing to bring a declaratory judgment action
under HRS 632-1, a plaintiff must allege that: 
(1) he or she has suffered an actual or threatened injury as
a result of the defendant's wrongful conduct, (2) the injury
is fairly traceable to the defendant's actions, and (3) a
favorable decision would likely provide relief for the
plaintiff's injury.  The point of the first prong of the
test is, that the plaintiff must show a distinct and
palpable injury to himself or herself. The injury must be
distinct and palpable, as opposed to abstract, conjectural,
or merely hypothetical.
Bremner, 96 Hawai# i at 139-40, 28 P.3d at 355-56 (citations and
quotation marks omitted) (applying this test in a declaratory
judgment action arising under HRS chapter 632).  
As discussed above, McGee does not allege that she
suffered an actual or threatened injury that was traceable to Say
and Friends of Say's campaign expenditures.  See E & J Lounge
Operating Co. v. Liquor Comm'n of City & Cty. of Honolulu, 118
Hawai#i 320, 346, 189 P.3d 432, 458 (2008).  McGee had no
personal stake in whether Say and Friends of Say's expenditures
were proper.  See Bremner , 96 Hawai #i at 143, 28 P.3d at 359. 
Therefore, McGee had no standing before the Circuit Court under
HRS chapter 632.
(2) & (3) As we have concluded that McGee did not have
standing to challenge the Commission's order dismissing the
agency complaint, we need not reach her second and third points
of error.
For the foregoing reasons, the Circuit Court's
September 21, 2015 Judgment is vacated and the Circuit Court's
September 21, 2015 Dismissal Order is affirmed in part and
11NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
vacated in part.  Paragraph (3) of the Dismissal Order is
vacated; and, the Dismissal Order is affirmed in all other
respects.  This case is remanded to the Circuit Court for further
proceedings on McGee's request for a declaration, pursuant to HRS
§ 91-7, that the Commission failed to follow rulemaking
procedures under HRS § 91-3 for practices related to complaints
and investigations before the Commission.
