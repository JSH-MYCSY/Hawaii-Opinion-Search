APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 14-1-1218)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Chan, JJ.)

 
Defendant-Appellant Diane E. Mather (Mather) appeals
 
pro se from the October 12, 2015 "Findings of Fact and
 
Conclusions of Law; Order Granting Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary
 Judgment and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure Filed July
 31, 2015", and "Judgment" entered by the Circuit Court of the
 
1
First Circuit (circuit court)  in which the circuit court granted
summary judgment and a decree of foreclosure in favor of
 Plaintiff-Appellee CitiMortgage, Inc. (CitiMortgage).
 
On appeal, Mather seems to primarily contend that the

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
circuit court erred in granting summary judgment because a
 
genuine issue of material fact remained as to whether
 CitiMortgage was in possession of the original promissory note at
 the commencement of and throughout the foreclosure proceeding,
 and therefore lacked standing to foreclose on the subject
 mortgage.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude that
 Mather's appeal is without merit.
 
The Hawai
�i Supreme Court recently discussed the 
standing requirements for foreclosing parties, holding that: 
In order to prove entitlement to foreclose, the foreclosing
party must demonstrate that all conditions precedent toforeclose under the note and mortgage are satisfied and thatall steps required by statute have been strictly compliedwith. 
See
 55 Am. Jur. 2d Mortgages § 575 (Nov. 2016
Update). This typically requires the plaintiff to prove theexistence of an agreement, the terms of the agreement, adefault by the mortgagor under the terms of the agreement,and giving of the cancellation notice. See Bank of 
Honolulu, N.A. v. Anderson, 3 Haw. App. 545, 551,654 P.2d1370, 1375 (1982) (citing 55 Am. Jur. 2d Mortgages § 554(1971)). A foreclosing plaintiff must also prove itsentitlement to enforce the note and mortgage. 
Bank of America, N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai �i 361, 367, 390 
P.3d 1248, 1254 (2017) (further citations omitted).
 
In addition, a party seeking to foreclose on a property
 
must submit an attorney affirmation in compliance with Hawai �i 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 667-17 (2016), which provides:
 
Any attorney who files on behalf of a mortgagee seeking to
foreclose on a residential property under this part shall
sign and submit an affirmation that the attorney has
verified the accuracy of the documents submitted, under
penalty of perjury and subject to applicable rules of
professional conduct. The affirmation shall be filed with
 the court at the time that the action is commenced . . . .
 
HRS § 490:3-301 (2008) provides that "the holder of the
 
instrument" is entitled to enforce the instrument. 
HRS § 490:1-201 (2008) defines a "[h]older" as the "person in
 possession of a negotiable instrument that is payable either to
 bearer or to an identified person that is the person in
 possession." HRS § 490:3-201 (2008) further provides:

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
(a) "Negotiation" means a transfer of possession, whether
voluntary or involuntary, of an instrument by a person other
than the issuer to a person who thereby becomes its holder.
 
(b) Except for negotiation by a remitter, if an instrument
is payable to an identified person, negotiation requires
transfer of possession of the instrument and its indorsement
by the holder. If an instrument is payable to bearer, it
may be negotiated by transfer of possession alone.
 
(Emphasis added.)
Here, the "Initial InterestSM Adjustable Rate Note"
 
(Note) and "Allonge to Note" (Allonge) were attached to
 
CitiMortgage's Complaint to Foreclose Mortgage (Complaint) 2
. The
 
Note was originally made payable to ABN AMRO Mortgage Group, Inc.
 
(ABN). Therefore, in order for ABN to negotiate the Note in favor
 
of CitiMortgage, it was required that: (1) possession of the
 
original Note be transferred to CitiMortgage; and (2) the Note be
 
3
indorsed specially  to CitiMortgage.  Here, it appears that ABN
 
properly negotiated the Note by specially indorsing the Allonge
 in favor of CitiMortgage. 
The Complaint stated that CitiMortgage "is the current
 
entity entitled to enforce the terms of the Note by virtue of an
 Allonge to Note attached to the Note" and that a "true and
 correct copy of the Note, with all personal and confidential
 information redacted, is attached as Exhibit '5' and incorporated
 by reference herein." Counsel for CitiMortgage concurrently
 filed an "Attorney Affirmation" affirming that counsel had
 verified the accuracy of the documents. In addition, Jeanine
 Cohoon, Business Operations Analyst of CitiMortgage, (Cohoon)
 
declared in writing, under penalty of perjury, that CitiMortgage
 
"is also the owner of the Note" and that a "true and correct copy
 of the Note is attached hereto as Exhibit 1, along with a duly
 executed Allonge to Note with an indorsement to CitiMortgage,
 Inc." We find that a copy of the specially indorsed Note payable
 to CitiMortgage attached to the Complaint, combined with Cohoon's
 
2
 Although Reyes-Toledo is distinguishable from this case in that
 
the Note at issue in Reyes-Toledo was indorsed in blank and attached to the
Summary Judgment Motion rather than a specially indorsed Note attached to the
Complaint, we find the application of the case appropriate for purposes of
standing.

 A special indorsement occurs if the indorsement is made by the
holder of an instrument and the indorsement identifies a person to whom it
makes the instrument payable. HRS § 490:3-205(a) (2008).

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
authentication of the Note and the submission of an attorney
 
affirmation sufficient to establish that CitiMortgage was the
 "holder" of the Note at the commencement of the foreclosure
 action. 
Through (1) the submission of the foregoing documents,
 
(2) copies of the mortgage and assignment, (3) the Declaration of Karyn A. Doi, filed February 25, 2015 with a letter notifying Mather of her default attached, and (4) the exhibits and declarations submitted in support of the Complaint and Motion for Summary Judgment, CitiMortgage established: (1) the existence and execution by Mather of the subject note and mortgage; (2) the terms of the note and mortgage; (3) default on the payments due under the terms of the note and mortgage; (4) notice of default; and (5) CitiMortgage's entitlement to enforce the Note at the commencement of the proceedings. 
See Reyes-Toledo , 139 Hawai �i at 
367, 390 P.3d at 1254 (2017). Therefore, there is no genuine issue of material fact that CitiMortgage established its entitlement and standing to foreclose in this case. 
Mather's other assertions related to CitiMortgage's

 
failure to prove its possession of the "original" Note are
 without merit. Evidence in the record clearly establishes that
 the circuit court did not err in finding that CitiMortgage was
 the holder of the original Note.
 
Mather also contends that the circuit court erred in
 
granting CitiMortgage's Motion for Summary Judgment because
 Cohoon's "Declaration in Support of Plaintiff's Motion for
 Summary Judgment" (Cohoon Declaration) failed to comply with Rule
 
4
56(e) of the Hawai �i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) . The Rules 
4
 HRCP 56(e) provides:
 
(e) Form of affidavits; further testimony; defense required.
Supporting and opposing affidavits shall be made on personal
knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in
evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is
competent to testify to the matters stated therein. Sworn or
certified copies of all papers or parts thereof referred to in an
affidavit shall be attached thereto or served therewith. The court
 may permit affidavits to be supplemented or opposed by
depositions, answers to interrogatories, or further affidavits.
When a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as
provided in this rule, an adverse party may not rest upon the mere
allegations or denials of the adverse party's pleading, but the
adverse party's response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
of the Circuit Courts of the State of Hawai �i (RCCH) Rule 7(g) 
allows for an unsworn declaration in lieu of an affidavit if the 
declarant declares under the penalty of law that the statements found within the declaration are "true and correct." The Cohoon Declaration was in compliance with RCCH Rule 7(g) and therefore, Mather's argument is without merit. See U.S. Bank N.A. v. Mattos, 137 Hawai
�i 209, 212, 367 P.3d 703, 706 (App. 2016). 
Additionally, Mather asserts that Cohoon is not an 
authenticating witness and therefore, the Cohoon Declaration did not authenticate any of the documents referenced as exhibits in the declaration. "The Hawai
�i Supreme Court has held that a 
'qualified witness' can authenticate a document as a record of regularly conducted activity pursuant to [Hawai
�i Rules of 
5
Evidence (HRE)] Rule 803(b)(6) . . . ."  Mattos, 137 Hawai �i at 
213, 367 P.3d at 707 (citing State v. Fitzwater, 122 Hawai �i 354, 
366, 227 P.3d 520, 532 (2010), as amended Apr. 5, 2010). 
The Cohoon Declaration stated that Cohoon is an
 
employee of CitiMortgage. The Cohoon Declaration further stated
 that Cohoon, as custodian of the records referenced, has access
 and is familiar with CitiMortgage's books and records regarding
 Mather's loan and that Cohoon is familiar with the manner in
 which CitiMortgage maintains its books and records. Moreover, the
 Cohoon Declaration indicated that CitiMortgage's documents, which
 Cohoon referred to in preparing her declaration, were records
 
in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is
a genuine issue for trial. If the adverse party does not so
respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered
against the adverse party.

 HRE Rule 803(b)(6) provides:
Rule 803 Hearsay exceptions; availability of declarant immaterial.
 
...
 (b) Other exceptions.
 ...
 (6) Records of regularly conducted activity. A memorandum, report,
record, or data compilation, in any form, of acts, events, conditions,
opinions, or diagnoses, made in the course of a regularly conducted
activity, at or near the time of the acts, events, conditions, opinions,
or diagnoses, as shown by the testimony of the custodian or other
qualified witness, or by certification that complies with rule 902(11)
or a statute permitting certification, unless the sources of information
or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness.

"made at or near the time of the occurrence of the matters set 
forth in such records, by an employee or representative with knowledge of the acts or events recorded." Cohoon further declared that CitiMortgage "maintains and relies on these business records in the ordinary course of its mortgage loan servicing business" and confirms that "prior records for [Mather's loan] received from the Prior Servicer(s)/Lender(s) are accurate and have been incorporated into" CitiMortgage's business records for Mather's loan. Accordingly, the Cohoon Declaration established that CitiMortgage relies on the documents related to Mather's loan and the documents constituted "records of regularly conducted activity" that were admissible as a hearsay exception, pursuant to HRE Rule 803(b)(6). Therefore, the circuit court did not err in relying upon the documents when it granted summary judgment in favor of CitiMortgage. See Mattos, 137 Hawai
�i at 
213, 367 P.3d at 707. 
Accordingly, the circuit court's October 12, 2015
 
"Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law; Order Granting
 Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment and for Interlocutory
 Decree of Foreclosure Filed July 31, 2015" and "Judgment" are
 affirmed.
 
All other pending motions are denied.
