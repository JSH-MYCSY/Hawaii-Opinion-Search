APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 14-1-0501(2))

 
ORDER DISMISSING THE APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Upon review of the record, it appears that this court
 
lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiff-Appellant Maui Lani Neighbors,
 
Inc., a Hawai 'i Nonprofit Corporation's (Appellant's), appeal in NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
this case from the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit's 
February 23, 2015 "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Granting (1) [Defendants-Appellees] State of Hawai
'i, State 
of Hawai 'i, Department of Land and Natural Resources, State of 
Hawai'i Board of Land and Natural Resources, and William Aila, 
Jr.'s [sic], in his Official Capacity as Chair of the State of Hawai
'i Board of Land and Natural Resources, December 5, 2014 
Motion for Partial Dismissal of [Appellant's] Motion and (2) Dismissing With Prejudice Counts I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VIII, and IX of the First Amended Verified Complaint" (Order Granting State 
Appellees' Motion to Dismiss) and September 10, 2015 "Order Granting [Appellant's] July 6, 2015 Motion: (1) For Dismissal 
Without Prejudice of Count VII; and (2) For Final Judgment"
1 
(Order Granting Appellant's Motion for Dismissal and Final 
Judgment). The foregoing have not yet been reduced to a separate judgment that resolves all claims against all parties in this 
case pursuant to Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP) and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & 
Wright, 76 Hawai 'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
Under Hawai 'i law, "[a]ppeals shall be allowed in civil 
matters from all final judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit 
. . . courts[.]" HRS § 641-1(a) (Supp. 2015). Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c) (Supp. 2015). Rule 58 of the HRCP requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." The Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has held that 
1
 The Honorable Peter T. Cahill issued the orders.

"[a]n appeal may be taken from circuit court orders resolving 
claims against parties only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. "Thus, based on 
Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 
Hawai
'i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008); Bailey v. 
DuVauchelle, 135 Hawai 'i 482, 489, 353 P.3d 1024, 1031 (2015). 
Furthermore, "an appeal from any judgment will be dismissed as premature if the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i 
at 119, 869 at 1338. When interpreting the requirements for a judgment under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i noted: 
If we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
 
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality, . . . and we should not make such searches
necessary by allowing the parties the option of waiving the
requirements of HRCP [Rule] 58.
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. "An appeal from an 
order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor of or against 
the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Id. at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote 
omitted). 
The record on appeal in appellate court case number
 
CAAP-15-0000713 contains no final judgment. Therefore, this
 appeal is premature.

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellate Case No. CAAP-15­
0000713 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
