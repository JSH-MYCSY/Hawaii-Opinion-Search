"this week," which ended September 23, 2016.
 
On September 29, 2016 Counsel filed a Third
 
Supplemental Declaration which stated that there were parts of
 the record that he had not previously seen because he was not
 trial counsel, thus, requiring extensive revision of the briefs
 but that the brief would be filed "within a day or two," which
 period would have ended on October 3, 2016.
 
To date, no opening or answering brief has been filed
 
by Counsel. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion to Dismiss is
 
granted as follows:
 
(1) The appeal by the Wrights is dismissed pursuant to
 
HRAP Rule 30.
 
(2) No Answering Brief in the cross appeal shall be
 
filed by the Wrights. The appellate clerk shall place the cross-
appeal on the ready calendar.
