Appellants-Cross Appellees Daneford Michael Wright and Ellareen Uilani Wright (Wrights), the response to the Motion for Reconsideration filed on November 3, 2016 by US Bank National Association as Trustee for the Structured Asset Securities Corporation Mortgage Loan Trust, 2006-NC1 (US Bank), the errata to US Bank's response to the Motion for Reconsideration filed by US Bank on November 7, 2016, and the record and files herein, it appears that on October 11, 2016, this court ordered that the appeal by the Wrights be dismissed and that US Bank's cross appeal be placed on the ready calendar and "[n]o Answering Brief in the cross appeal shall be filed by the Wrights" due to the failure of the Wrights to timely file an Opening Brief in their appeal and an Answering Brief in the cross appeal. In the Motion for Reconsideration, the Wrights did not demonstrate good cause to excuse the Wrights' failure to timely file an Opening Brief on appeal and an Answering Brief on cross appeal. The Wrights also filed an Answering Brief on October 24, 2016, in violation of this court's order that no answering brief be filed in the cross appeal.
