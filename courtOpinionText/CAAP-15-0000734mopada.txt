MEMORANDUM OPINION 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Chan, JJ.) 
I. Introduction 
In CAAP-15-0000734, Defendants-Appellants Richard 
Anthony Marques and Laura Marie Marques (collectively, the 
Marqueses) appeal from a "Judgment" entered on September 11, 2015 
(First Judgment) by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit 
(
Circuit Court).  The Marqueses also challenge the Circuit 
Court's "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law; Order Granting 
Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment on All Claims and Against (1) Richard Anthony Marques, (2) Laura Marie Marques, (3) Jim Hogg, (4) Palehua Community Association, (5) Director of Budget and Fiscal Services, City and County of Honolulu, and (6) Makakilo Ridge Community Association; Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure and Order of Sale Filed on August 20, 2014" (FOFs/COLs and Order) also entered on September 11, 2015.

On appeal, the Marqueses allege twelve points of error, 
all essentially based on their contention that they rescinded the two subject loans under 15 U.S.C. ยง 1601 et seq., the Truth in Lending Act (TILA).

In CAAP-16-0000827, the Marqueses appeal from a 
"Judgment" entered on October 20, 2016 (Second Judgment) by the 
Circuit Court.
8 The Marqueses also challenge an "Order Granting 
Plaintiff's Motion for Confirmation of Sale, for Distribution of 
Proceeds, for Writ of Possession, and for Deficiency Judgment" (Order Confirming Sale) also entered by the Circuit Court on 
October 20, 2016. 
On April 13, 2017, we entered an order consolidating 
CAAP-15-0000734 and CAAP-16-0000827, and on August 22, 2017, we 
issued an order granting the Marqueses' motion to waive filing of a supplemental opening brief in this consolidated appeal. Therefore, the only points of error on appeal are those argued by the Marqueses in CAAP-15-0000734.

in Kapolei, Hawai# i, formerly owned by the Marqueses (the 
property). 
On September 16, 2008, Bank of Hawai# i made the First 
Loan in the amount of $1,105,000.00 to the Marqueses, secured by 
a mortgage on the property. 
On October 16, 2008, Bank of Hawai# i made the Second 
Loan in the amount of $170,000.00 to Richard only, secured by a mortgage on the property (Second Loan). 
On June 29, 2011, Bank of Hawai# i filed a Complaint 
alleging that the Marqueses were in default on both the First and Second Loans, and sought to foreclose upon its mortgage and security interests in the property. 
On July 26, 2011, the Marqueses filed their Answer. 
Attached to the Answer as an exhibit was a July 25, 2011 letter from the Marqueses' counsel to Bank of Hawai# i's counsel, stating 
that Bank of Hawai# i is "hereby notified" that the Marqueses 
"exercise their right to cancel [the First and Second Loans] based upon numerous federal Truth-In-Lending-Act violations, including but not limited to the failure to deliver to each of them two completed copies of the notice of right to cancel and required disclosure statements." 
(7/25/11 Letter).9 
On February 14, 2014,10 Bank of Hawai# i filed its First 
Amended Complaint.11 
On February 24, 2014, the Marqueses filed their Answer 
to the First Amended Complaint. 
9 The 7/25/11 Letter was sent within three years of "consummation of
the transaction[,]" i.e. , the First and Second Loans, as provided in 15 U.S.C.
ยง 1635(f). In its Answering Brief, Bank of Hawai #i states that "counsel for 
[Bank of Hawai #i] received a Request to Cancel letter from the Marques'
counsel" and "[t]he letter was attached to the Marques' Answer to
Complaint[,]" citing the 7/25/11 Letter. 
10 Bankruptcy filings by Laura Marie Marques ( Laura ), subsequently
dismissed by the Bankruptcy Court of the District of Hawai #i, appeared to have
delayed proceedings in the Circuit Court. 
11 The First Amended Complaint added the Makakilo Ridge Community
Association as a defendant, but is otherwise substantially identical to theoriginal Complaint. 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On August 20, 2014, Bank of Hawai# i filed a "Motion for 
Summary Judgment on All Claims and Against Defendants (1) Richard 
Anthony Marques, (2) Laura Marie Marques, (3) Jim Hogg, (4) Palehua Community Association, (5) Director of Budget and Fiscal Services, City and County of Honolulu, and (6) Makakilo Ridge Community Association" (Motion for Summary Judgment). 
On November 5, 2014, the Marqueses filed their 
opposition to Bank of Hawaii's Motion for Summary Judgment. 
On September 11, 2015, the Circuit Court entered its 
FOFs/COLs and Order and its First Judgment, both in favor of Bank of Hawai
#i. 
On October 12, 2015, the Marqueses timely appealed. On May 25, 2016, Bank of Hawai# i filed its "Motion for 
Confirmation of Sale, for Distribution of Proceeds, for Writ of Possession, and for Deficiency Judgment" (Motion to Confirm 
Sale). 
On June 22, 2016, the Marqueses filed their opposition 
to Bank of Hawai# i's Motion to Confirm Sale. 
On October 20, 2016, the Circuit Court entered its 
Order Confirming Sale and Second Judgment, both in favor of Bank 
of Hawai# i. 
On November 21, 2016, the Marqueses timely appealed.
III. Discussion 
We review the Circuit Court's grant of summary judgment 
de novo
.  Kawashima v. State, 140 Hawai# i 139, 148, 398 P.3d 728, 
737 (2017). 
The threshold issues on appeal are (1) whether the 
Marqueses raised genuine issues of material fact as to whether Bank of 
Hawai# i provided the required Notices of Right to Cancel 
at the signing of the two subject loans, and, if so, (2) whether the loans were properly and timely rescinded by the Marqueses, so as to render summary judgment in favor of Bank of Hawai# i 
improper.

In E. Sav. Bank, FSB v. Esteban, 129 Hawai# i 154, 296 
P.3d 1062 (2013), the Supreme Court of 
Hawai# i summarized the law 
pertaining to disclosures required under TILA: 
One protection available to consumers under TILA is a right
of rescission in any consumer credit transaction in which asecurity interest is acquired in property used as theprincipal dwelling of the person to whom credit is extended;this "buyer's remorse" provision extends for three businessdays following consummation of the transaction or deliveryof the relevant disclosures to the consumer. 15 U.S.C. ยง1635(a).[
12] 
TILA requires that creditors clearly and conspicuouslydisclose information regarding the right to rescind andprovide borrowers with appropriate forms to exercise thisright. 15 U.S.C. ยง 1635(a). Where a creditor fails to make the required disclosures under TILA, the act extends theborrower's right to rescind for three years afterconsummation of the subject transaction. 15 U.S.C. ยง 1635(f).[
13] 
12 15 U.S.C. 1635(a) (2012) provides: 
(a) Disclosure of obligor's right to rescind 
Except as otherwise provided in this section, in the case ofany consumer credit transaction (including opening orincreasing the credit limit for an open end credit plan) inwhich a security interest, including any such interestarising by operation of law, is or will be retained oracquired in any property which is used as the principaldwelling of the person to whom credit is extended, theobligor shall have the right to rescind the transactionuntil midnight of the third business day following theconsummation of the transaction or the delivery of theinformation and rescission forms required under this sectiontogether with a statement containing the materialdisclosures required under this subchapter, whichever islater, by notifying the creditor, in accordance withregulations of the Bureau, of his intention to do so. The creditor shall clearly and conspicuously disclose, inaccordance with regulations of the Bureau, to any obligor ina transaction subject to this section the rights of theobligor under this section. The creditor shall also provide, in accordance with regulations of the Bureau,appropriate forms for the obligor to exercise his right torescind any transaction subject to this section. 
13 15 U.S.C. 1635(f) (2012) provides: 
(f) Time limit for exercise of right 
An obligor's right of rescission shall expire three yearsafter the date of consummation of the transaction or uponthe sale of the property, whichever occurs first,notwithstanding the fact that the information and formsrequired under this section or any other disclosures

Id. at 157โ58, 296 P.3d at 1065โ66 (footnotes omitted). 
Furthermore: 
Regulation Z, issued by the Federal Reserve Board,
implements TILA's requirements and describes the right ofrescission as follows: 
The consumer may exercise the right to rescind untilmidnight of the third business day following theoccurrence described in paragraph (a)(1) of thissection that gave rise to the right of rescission,delivery of the notice required by paragraph (b) ofthis section, or delivery of all material disclosures,whichever occurs last. If the required notice andmaterial disclosures are not delivered, the right to
rescind shall expire 3 years after the occurrence
giving rise to the right of rescission, or upontransfer of all of the consumer's interest in theproperty, or upon sale of the property, whicheveroccurs first. . . . 
12 C.F.R. ยง 226.15(a)(3) (emphasis added). 
This court previously described the contours of TILA'srequirements and remedies in Hawaii Community Federal CreditUnion v. Keka, 94 
Hawai #i 213, 11 P.3d 1 (2000), where we
explained: 
[ ] TILA requires creditors to provide borrowers withclear and accurate disclosures of terms dealing withthings like finance charges, annual percentage ratesof interest, and the borrower's rights. 
Failure to 
satisfy TILA subjects a lender to criminal penaltiesfor noncompliance, . . . as well as to statutory andactual damages traceable to a lender's failure to makethe requisite disclosures. . . . 
Going beyond these rights to damages, TILA also
authorizes a borrower whose loan is secured with his principal dwelling, and who has been denied therequisite disclosures, to rescind the loan transactionentirely, until midnight of the third day followingthe consummation of the transaction or the delivery ofthe information and rescission forms required under 
(...continued)
required under this part have not been delivered to theobligor, except that if (1) any agency empowered to enforcethe provisions of this subchapter institutes a proceeding toenforce the provisions of this section within three yearsafter the date of consummation of the transaction, (2) suchagency finds a violation of this section, and (3) theobligor's right to rescind is based in whole or in part onany matter involved in such proceeding, then the obligor'sright of rescission shall expire three years after the dateof consummation of the transaction or upon the earlier saleof the property, or upon the expiration of one yearfollowing the conclusion of the proceeding, or any judicialreview or period for judicial review thereof, whichever is 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
this section together with a statement containing the
material disclosures required under this subchapter,whichever is later. TILA provides, however, that theborrower's right of rescission shall expire threeyears after the date of consummation of thetransaction or upon the sale of the property,whichever occurs first, even if the requireddisclosures have never been made. TILA gives aborrower no express permission to assert the right ofrescission as an affirmative defense after the expiration of the 3โyear period. 
94 Hawai #i at 223, 11 P.3d at 11 (internal citations,
quotation marks, and brackets omitted). 
Id. at 158 n.7, 296 P.3d at 1066 n.7 (brackets and ellipses in 
original). 
In Keka, the Hawaii Supreme Court more closely examined 
the issue of proving rescission pursuant to inadequate disclosures under TILA. 
There, lender Credit Union's motion for 
summary judgment included an affidavit by Charles E. Paranial, an officer of the Credit Union, which attached "true" copies of, inter alia, the required Notice of Right to Cancel disclosures, which the Kekas, as borrowers, admitted to signing on the date they signed their loan documents. Id. at 218, 224, 11 P.3d at 6, 12. However, the Kekas' affidavits and a declaration submitted in opposition to the Credit Union's motion stated that they did not receive copies of the Notice of Right to Cancel disclosures at signing. Id. at 224, 11 P.3d at 12. The supreme court noted that "TILA provides that 'written acknowledgment of receipt of any disclosures required under this subchapter by a person to whom information, forms, and a statement is required to be given pursuant to this section does no more than create a rebuttable presumption of delivery thereof.'" Id. (citing 15 U.S.C ยง 1635(c)).   The supreme court further noted that: 
14
14 15 U.S.C. 1635(c) (2012) provides: 
(c) Rebuttable presumption of delivery of required 
disclosures 
Notwithstanding any rule of evidence, written acknowledgment
of receipt of any disclosures required under this subchapterby a person to whom information, forms, and a statement is

10 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The case law of other jurisdictions is well settled that a
debtor's affidavit averring non-delivery is sufficient tocreate a genuine issue of material fact as to whether thestatutory presumption had been rebutted, thereby precludingsummary judgment with respect to a claim based upon adebtor's assertion of non-delivery. Stone v. Mehlberg, 728F.Supp. 1341, 1353โ54 (W.D. Mich.1989 & Supp. Opinion 1990);Powers v. Sims & Levin Realtors, 396 F.Supp. 12, 22โ23(E.D.Va.1975) ("congressional policy, as expressed by 15U.S.C. ยง 1635(c), precludes granting a creditor summaryjudgment on the basis of a receipt acknowledgment alonewhere the [debtors] deny by affidavit that they received thedisclosures required by [TILA]"); Cintron v. Bankers TrustCo., 682 So.2d 616, 616โ17 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1996); AwardLumber & Constr. Co., Inc. v. Humphries, 110 Ill.App.3d 119,65 Ill.Dec. 676, 441 N.E.2d 1190, 1191โ92 (1982) (discussingrelevant case law and concluding that, "while an affidavitof non-delivery from defendant in this case would havesufficed to create a material issue of fact, the mereallegation thereof . . . is insufficient to rebut thepresumption raised by the signed acknowledgment ofreceipt"). 
Id. at 224-25, 11 P.3d at 12-13. The supreme court held that 
"the Kekas' affidavits and declaration raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Credit Union timely provided the Kekas with the disclosures required by TILA[,]" and consequently the supreme court vacated the lower court's grant of summary judgment with respect to the Keka's counterclaim for damages arising from this TILA violation. Id. at 225, 11 P.3d at 13. 
In the instant case, Bank of Hawai# i attached two 
"Notice of Right to Cancel" documents to their reply to the Marqueses' opposition to the summary judgment motion. 
The first 
Notice, dated September 16, 2008, bears both the Marqueses' signatures beneath the statement, "The undersigned each acknowledge receipt of two copies of NOTICE of RIGHT TO CANCEL and one copy of the Federal Truth in Lending Disclosure Statement." The second Notice, dated October 16, 2008, bears Richard's signature beneath the statement "I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I RECEIVED TWO (2) COPIES OF THIS NOTICE OF RIGHT TO CANCEL AND ONE (1) COPY OF THE TRUTH IN LENDING DISCLOSURES." 
(...continued)
required to be given pursuant to this section does no more
than create a rebuttable presumption of delivery thereof. 
11  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
However, Richard's Declaration attached to the 
Marqueses' opposition to Bank of Hawai# i's summary judgment 
motion states the following: 
11. As I was signing the [Second Loan] documents, I
was provided with a Notice of Right to Cancel  ("Notice"),
attached as Exhibit 5 . This was my first time seeing the
Notice, and only I was required to sign it. Neither Laura 
nor myself were provided or required to sign the Notice at
the time we signed the [First Loan] documents. 
(Emphasis in original). Exhibit 5 is identical to the second 
Notice attached to Bank of Hawai# i's reply.
A. First Loan 
Pursuant to Keka and given that the 7/25/11 Letter
was submitted to Bank of Hawai# i's
 counsel within three years of 
the First Loan, see 15 U.S.C. ยง 1635(f), Richard's Declaration 
raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Bank of Hawai# i timely provided the Marqueses with the Notice of Right to 
Cancel disclosure required by TILA for the First Loan. Keka, 94 Hawai# i at 224-25, 11 P.3d at 12-13. Therefore, we must vacate 
the portions of the Circuit Court's First and Second Judgment and underlying Orders in favor of Bank of Hawai# i relating to that 
First Loan. 15 
In reaching this conclusion, we disagree with Bank of 
Hawai# i's contention that, pursuant to Beazie v. Amerifund 
Financial, Inc., Civil No. 09-00562 JMS/KSC, 2011 WL 2457725 (D. Haw. June 16, 2011) (citing Yamamoto v. Bank of N.Y., 329 F.3d 1167 (9th Cir. 2003)), summary judgment was proper in the instant case, even assuming timely rescission by the Marqueses, because 
15 We disagree with Bank of Hawai #i's contention that the 7/25/11 Letter
was defective under 15 U.S.C. 1635(a) because it was sent from borrower's
counsel to lender's counsel, rather than from borrower to lender directly.See Belini v. Washington Mut. Bank, FA, 412 F.3d 17, 21, 27 (1st Cir. 2005)(holding that borrower's rescission notice, sent by borrower's counsel to thelender, constituted valid notice of rescission under 15 U.S.C. ยง 1653);Williams v. Wells Fargo Home Mortg., Inc., 410 Fed.Appx. 495, 497-98, 2011 WL395978, at *1-2 (3
rd Cir. 2011) (describing in its legal analysis the
borrower's rescission notice, sent by borrower's counsel to lender, as "[t]henotice to rescind[.]"). Bank of Hawai #i cites no relevant authority for its
proposition that notice of rescission must be sent only from borrower directlyto the lender to be effective. 
12 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the record showed the Marqueses lacked the capacity to pay back 
the loans. 
In Beazie, the United States District Court for the 
District of Hawai# i (District Court) held that despite the 
sequence of events outlined in 15 U.S.C. ยง 1635(b), a court has discretion to require borrowers to prove ability to pay as a condition of rescission under TILA. Id. at *7. Specifically: 
As rescission under ยง 1635(b) is an on-going process
consisting of a number of steps, there is no reasonwhy a court that may alter the sequence of proceduresafter deciding that rescission is warranted, may notdo so before deciding that rescission is warrantedwhen it finds that, assuming grounds for rescissionexist, rescission still could not be enforced becausethe borrower cannot comply with the borrower'srescission obligations no matter what. Such a decision lies within the court's equitable discretion,taking into consideration all the circumstancesincluding the nature of the violations and theborrower's ability to repay the proceeds. If, as wasthe case here, it is clear from the evidence that theborrower lacks capacity to pay back what she hasreceived (less interest, finance charges, etc.), thecourt does not lack discretion to do before trial what it could do after. 
Yamamoto v. Bank of N.Y., 329 F.3d 1167, 1173 (9th Cir.2003)[.] 
. . . . Based upon the evidence presented, the court exercises its
discretion in finding that rescission should be conditionedon Plaintiff's tender of the loan proceeds. 
Id. (emphasis added). In Beazie, the District Court thus 
exercised its discretion, but also determined based on the record in that case that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the borrower could tender the loan proceeds. Id. at *8-9. 
Here, at no point in the transcripts, FOFs/COL and 
Order, or First Judgment does the Circuit Court indicate that it is exercising its discretion to deviate from the steps described in 15 U.S.C ยง 1635(b).
B. Second Loan 
Pursuant to Keka, Richard's Declaration did not raise a 
genuine issue of material fact with regards to the Second Loan to 
13 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
rebut the presumption of delivery of the Notice of Right to 
Cancel. See 15 U.S.C. ยง 1635(c). Contrary to the arguments in the Marqueses' Opening Brief, Richard's Declaration and Exhibit 5 demonstrate that Richard was indeed "provided with a Notice of Right to Cancel" "as [he] was signing" the Second Loan. 
Neither the Marqueses' Opening Brief nor the Marqueses' 
opposition to summary judgment allege any other TILA violations with regard to the Second Loan that would trigger the three-year rather than three-day rescission deadline.
16 Accordingly, the 
Circuit Court did not err in granting summary judgment with regard to the Second Loan.
IV. Conclusion 
For the reasons discussed above, we conclude that: 
In CAAP-15-0000734, to the extent that they address the 
Second Loan, we affirm the "Judgment" and the "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law; Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment on All Claims and Against Defendants (1) Richard Anthony Marques, (2) Laura Marie Marques, (3) Jim Hogg, (4) Palehua Community Association, (5) Director of Budget and Fiscal Services, City and County of Honolulu, and (6) Makakilo Ridge Community Association; Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure and Order of Sale Filed on August 20, 2014," both entered on September 11, 2015 by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit. However, we vacate the September 11, 2015 Judgment and order to the extent they pertain to the First Loan. 
Similarly, in CAAP-16-0000827, to the extent that they 
address the Second Loan, we affirm the "Judgment" and "Order 
16 Although Richard's Declaration states that he personally sent a
notice of rescission of the Loans to Bank of Hawai #i, theoretically in
addition to the 7/25/11 Letter, such notice was untimely under the three-day
deadline. Richard's Declaration does not provide a date or a copy of saidletter, but does state that, after signing the Loans, he saw his "monthlypayments increase," learned borrowers are able to cancel a loan after agreeingto it, and "[p]ursuant to my right to cancel, I sent Bank of Hawai #i notice of 
rescission regarding the [First and Second Loan.]" (Emphasis added). We infer that Richard wrote to Bank of Hawai #i more than three days after consummating
the Second Loan, rendering his rescission untimely and ineffective in light ofthe circumstances.

This case is remanded to the Circuit Court of the First 
Circuit for further proceedings consistent with this Memorandum Opinion.
