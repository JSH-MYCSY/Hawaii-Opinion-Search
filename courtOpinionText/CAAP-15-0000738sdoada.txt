STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v. 
HERNET BUNGITAK, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CR. NO. 13-1-1400) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Hernet Bungitak (Bungitak
) appeals 
from the Judgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence (Judgment
) 
entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit 
Court)1 on September 16, 2015. Bungitak was convicted on three 
counts of Sexual Assault in the Third Degree. On appeal he 
contends that the Circuit Court erred when it denied his motion to dismiss the grand jury indictment. For the reasons explained below, we affirm the Judgment. 
I. 
On November 19, 2013, Bungitak was charged by 
Superseding Indictment (Indictment) with one count of Sexual 
Assault in the First Degree in violation of Hawaii Revised 
1 The Honorable Dexter D. Del Rosario presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Statutes (HRS) ยง 707-730(1)(b) (Supp. 2013)  and two counts 
of Sexual Assault in the Third Degree in violation of HRS 
ยง 707-732(1)(b) (Supp. 2013).  On January 16, 2015, Bungitak 
moved to dismiss the Indictment, alleging prosecutorial misconduct before the grand jury. The Circuit Court conducted a hearing on February 25, 2015. After hearing arguments from counsel, the Circuit Court denied the motion. The court stated: 32
In the present motion the issue is not whether there was
sufficient evidence presented to the Grand Jury. The issue was whether the conduct of the prosecutor invaded theprovince of the Grand Jury or intended to induce actionother than reach the jurors in their uninfluenced judgmentthe more -- on the evidence fairly presented before them.This is from Joao. In other words, whether the defendantwas denied a fair Grand Jury by being improperly influencedby the conduct of the State. And the burden is on the movant to show that the improper or illegal or incompetentevidence had improperly influenced the Grand Jury. The Court is going to find that the defendant has failed to meetits burden. For that reason, the motion's denied. 
Trial began on May 11, 2015. On May 13, 2015, the jury found 
Bungitak guilty on count one of the lesser included offense of Sexual Assault in the Third Degree, and guilty as charged on two counts of Sexual Assault in the Third Degree. On June 17, 2015, the Circuit Court entered its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying Defendant Hernet Bungitak's Motion to

Dismiss Indictment With Prejudice (FOF&COL). The Judgment was 
entered on September 16, 2015. This appeal followed. 
II. 
"A trial court's ruling on a motion to dismiss 
indictment is reviewed for an abuse of discretion." State v. 
Chong, 86 Hawai# i 290, 294, 949 P.2d 130, 134 (App. 1997) 
(quoting State v. Mendonca, 68 Haw. 280, 283, 711 P.2d 731, 734 (1985)). 
"An abuse of discretion occurs if the trial court has 
clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or 
principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party-litigant." Id. (quoting State v. Jackson, 81 Hawai# i 
39, 
47, 912 P.2d 71, 79 (1996)). We note that Bungitak does not challenge the Circuit Court's FOF&COL.  "Generally, findings not 
challenged on appeal are also binding on this court." State v. Griffin, 126 Hawai# i 40, 53, 266 P.3d 448, 461 (App. 2011) 
(quoting State v. Rapozo, 123 Hawai# i 329, 351, 235 P.3d 325, 347 
(2010)). 4
Bungitak argues that the State presented evidence to 
the grand jury, through the complaining witness (CW), of prior 
acts by Bungitak showing bad character. The State conceded that 
CW's testimony that Bungitak "laid by me on my bed one morning while I was sleeping" was improper.  But see Hawaii Rules of 
Evidence (HRE) Rule 1101(d)(2) (1993).

4 The opening brief incorrectly states that "The trial court did not
make any written findings of fact or conclusions of law." There were in fact 
eleven findings of fact entered. The first ten findings recited proceduralhistory and undisputed facts. Finding of fact no. 11 stated: "The court findsthe testimony of the Defendant to be not credible." 
5 Bungitak also argued below that a police detective's testimony, in
response to a grand juror's question, about a Child Protective Servicesinvestigation was improper, but he has abandoned that argument on appeal byfailing to address it in his opening brief. Hawai #i Rules of Appellate
Procedure ( HRAP ) Rule 28(b)(7). See Kahala Royal Corp. v. Goodsill Anderson
Quinn & Stifel, 113 Hawai #i 
 251, 275, 151 P.3d 732, 756 (2007) (holding that
claim not addressed in opening brief is deemed waived). 
6 HRE 1101 provides, in relevant part: 
(d) Rules inapplicable . The rules (other than with
respect to privileges) do not apply in the following:

However, Bungitak has the burden of proving that he was 
prejudiced by that testimony. 
[W]here sufficient legal and competent evidence
is presented to a grand jury, the reception ofillegal or incompetent evidence would notauthorize the court to set aside an indictment if the remaining legal evidence, considered as awhole, is sufficient to warrant the indictment. 
State v. Scotland, 58 Haw. 474, 476, 572 P.2d 497, 498(1977) (citing State v. Hassard, 45 Haw. 221, 365 P.2d 202(1961)). 
Chong, 86 Hawai# i at 295, 949 P.2d at 135. 
We hold that Bungitak was not prejudiced by CW's 
testimony because there was other sufficient, legal, and 
competent evidence presented to support the grand jury's indictment. CW testified that Bungitak "laid down on me and then he started to dry hump me." CW said she felt Bungitak's penis on her butt, and it was hard. CW told the grand jury that Bungitak was "touching my boobs . . . . squeezing them while he was dry humping me at the same time." CW also told the grand jury that Bungitak put his finger in her vagina "and then he just kept going in and out." The Circuit Court made the following conclusions of law, which Bungitak does not challenge on appeal: 
6. The Defendant has failed to prove that the
actions of the deputy prosecuting attorney invaded the
province of the grand jury or tended to induce action otherthan action jurors in their uninfluenced judgment would deemwarranted on evidence fairly presented before them, wherethere was no attack on the credibility of the complainingwitness during the grand jury proceeding. 
7. The Defendant failed to prove that the alleged
illegal or incompetent evidence clearly appears to haveimproperly influenced the grand jury. 
8. The Defendant has failed to meet its [sic]
burden of proof.

(2) Grand jury . Proceedings before grand juries.

The Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion when it concluded 
that Bungitak "failed to meet its [sic] burden of proof" and denied Bungitak's motion to dismiss.
