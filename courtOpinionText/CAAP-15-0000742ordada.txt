APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 13-1-0288)
ORDER GRANTING INTERVENOR ROBERT ROSEN'S MOTION (1)FOR
RECONSIDERATION OF SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER FILED
SEPTEMBER 5, 2017 AND (2) TO DISMISS THE APPEAL AS MOOT
(By: Reifurth, Presiding Judge, Chan and Nakasone, JJ.)
Upon consideration of Intervenor Robert Rosen's Motion
(1) for Reconsideration of Summary Disposition Order Filed
September 5, 2017 and (2) to Dismiss the Appeal as Moot, filed on
September 14, 2017 (Motion) and the attachments thereto,
Defendant-Appellant's Response to Robert Rosen's Motions, filed
on November 9, 2017, and the records and files herein, it appears
as follows:NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
In the underlying case, Plaintiff-Appellee Wells Fargo
Bank, N.A. (Wells Fargo) initiated foreclosure proceedings
against Defendant-Appellant Erum (Erum).  On September 15, 2015,
the circuit court entered its "Findings of Fact; Conclusions of
Law; Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment
Against All Parties and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure
Filed March 25, 2014" in favor of Wells Fargo.  Erum appealed
and, on September 5, 2017, this court entered its Summary
Disposition Order vacating the judgment on the basis that Wells
Fargo had failed to meet its burden of proof that all conditions
precedent to foreclosure were satisfied under Bank of America ,
N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo , 139 Hawai #i 361, 390 P.3d 1248 (2017).
On June 30, 2017, the circuit court entered its "Order
Granting Plaintiff's Motion to Confirm Sale After Reopening the
Auction, to Determine Priority of Liens, Approve Fees and Costs,
for Order to Close the Confirmed Auction or Reopening Auction
Bid; and for Writ of Ejectment Filed February 3, 2017" (Order
Confirming Sale).  That order, however, was not included in the
record on appeal before this court when we issued our Summary
Disposition Order.
Following the issuance of our Summary Disposition
Order, Robert Rosen (Rosen) moved to intervene in order to file a
motion to dismiss and request judicial notice of a Commissioner's
Deed, recorded on August 3, 2017, in the Bureau of Conveyances.
We ordered that the record on appeal be supplemented to include
any orders issued by the circuit court since the appeal was
taken, and invited responses from the parties to Rosen's Motion.
After review of the record as supplemented, we granted Rosen's
motion to intervene, and after consideration of the Motion and
the responses received, we conclude as follows.
In the instant Motion, Rosen contends that the appeal
is moot because vacating the Order Confirming Sale cannot reverse
the transfer of title due to the recordation of the
Commissioner's Deed on August 3, 2017 in the Bureau of
Conveyances.
The issue of mootness calls into question this court's
jurisdiction over the appeal.  It is well settled in Hawai# i that
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
[a] case is moot where the question to be determined is
abstract and does not rest on existing facts or rights.
Thus, the mootness doctrine is properly invoked where
"events . . . have so affected the relations between the
parties that the two conditions for justiciability relevant
on appeal –- adverse interest and effective remedy –- have
been compromised."
Okada Trucking Co. v. Bd. of Water Supply, 99 Hawai #i 191, 195-
96, 53 P.3d 799, 803-04 (2002) (citation and block quote format
omitted).  "Courts will not consume time deciding abstract
propositions of law or moot cases, and have no jurisdiction to do
so."  Wong v. Bd. of Regents, Univ. Of Hawai# i, 62 Haw. 391, 395,
616 P.2d 201, 204 (1980).
"A party who wishes to stay an order confirming a
foreclosure sale pending appeal must post a supersedeas bond
or otherwise obtain a stay pursuant to [Hawai #i Rules of
Civil Procedure] Rule 62 or [Hawai #i Rules of Appellate
Procedure] Rule 8.  If a stay is not obtained and the
property is sold to a bona fide purchaser, the appeal should
be dismissed as moot because no effective relief can be
granted."
Bank of New York Mellon v. R. Onaga, Inc., 140 Hawai# i 358, 370,
400 P.3d 559, 570 (2017).  In the instant case, Erum failed to
post a supersedeas bond or otherwise obtain a stay, and Rosen
lawfully purchased the property in good faith.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is
granted.  The Summary Disposition Order filed on September 5,
2017 is vacated and the appeal is dismissed as moot.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, November 17, 2017.
