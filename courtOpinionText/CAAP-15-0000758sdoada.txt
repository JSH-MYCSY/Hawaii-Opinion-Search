OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
SANDRA J. ROBERTS, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
RICHARD EMERY, ASSOCIATION OF APARTMENT OWNERS OF LIONA KONA,
LIONA KONA INC., ASSOCIATION OF APARTMENT OWNERS, and PORTER
McGUIRE KIAKONA and CHOW, LLP, Defendants-Appellees 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 15-1-044K) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, and Reifurth and Chan, JJ.) 
This appeal arises out of Plaintiff-Appellant Sandra J. 
Roberts' attempt to stay a non-judicial foreclosure sale to 
Defendant-Appellee Liona Kona Inc. Association of Apartment Owners, also sued as Association of Apartment owners of Liona Kona ("AOAO"). Roberts, pro se, appeals from the Order Granting Motion to Dismiss Complaint Filed 2/4/15 and for Summary Judgment in Favor of Defendants and Against Plaintiff (Filed 7/15/15) ("Order Granting the Motion to Dismiss") and the Final Judgment in Favor of Defendants and Against Plaintiff ("Final Judgment") entered by the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit
1/ ("Circuit 
Court") on September 18, 2015. 
In April 1997, Roberts purchased a condominium unit 
("Unit") from the AOAO. In or around 2011, Roberts fell behind on payments for maintenance and reserve fees. AOAO subsequently commenced formal collections proceedings to recover unpaid

assessments from Roberts, and instituted a non-judicial 
foreclosure under power of sale. 
On February 4, 2015, Roberts filed a complaint 
("Complaint") seeking "emergency injunctive and declaratory relief and to stay an imminent foreclosure sale," which at the time was scheduled for public auction on February 6, 2015. The Circuit Court initially granted a stay, but subsequently determined that the Complaint was not properly served on the defendants, that the stay had expired on its own terms, and the court would not renew the stay. 
On March 17, 2015, the Unit was sold at a public 
foreclosure auction to AOAO as the highest successful bidder. 
On June 18, 2015, Roberts filed a "Motion to Void Non-
Judicial Foreclosure Public Sale Held on March 17, 2017 [sic] at Noon and to Stay Ejectment Action in District Court Pursuant to HRCP Rule 9(a)(b)(c)(g)" ("Motion to Void Non-Judicial Foreclosure Sale"). On July 7, 2015, the Circuit Court orally denied the motion, determining that "it appears that [AOAO] complied with the requirements of the law regarding this nonjudicial foreclosure of sale regarding notice." On August 24, 2015, the Circuit Court entered its order denying the Motion to Void Non-Judicial Foreclosure Sale, and reiterating that AOAO had "complied with requirements.". 
On July 15, 2015, AOAO filed a "Motion to Dismiss 
Complaint Filed 2/14/15 [sic] and For Summary Judgment in Favor of Defendants and Against Plaintiff" ("Motion to Dismiss") on the basis that the Complaint was now moot. Roberts did not file any opposition. At the hearing on AOAO's Motion to Dismiss, the Circuit Court orally granted the motion because "the matter [was] moot as far as the Complaint goes" on the basis of the court's previous denial of the Motion to Void Non-Judicial Foreclosure Sale. On September 18, 2015, the Circuit Court entered the Order Granting Motion to Dismiss and the Final Judgment. 
On appeal, and in light of the various assertions and 
contentions made in Roberts' opening brief, the bulk of which were not raised during the relevant proceedings below and are

therefore deemed waived,/ we address Roberts' contention that
the Circuit Court erred in granting the Motion to Dismiss.  2
Upon careful review of the record and briefs submitted
by the parties and having given due consideration to the
arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as well
as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Roberts' point
of error as follows, and we vacate and remand. 
In her Complaint, Roberts contests AOAO's legal
capacity to conduct the non-judicial foreclosure sale.  Under
Sakal v. Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Hawaiian Monarch , 143
Hawaii# 219, 426 P.3d 443 (App. 2018), reconsideration denied,
2018 WL 4483207 (Haw. Ct. App. Sept. 19, 2018), cert granted , No.
SCWC-15-0000529, 2019 WL 245225 (Haw. Jan. 17, 2019), we hold
that because AOAO did not have a valid power of sale under its
bylaws it did not have authority under which to non-judicially
foreclose on Roberts' Unit.
Here, the Circuit Court's ruling on the Motion to
Dismiss was contingent upon its prior ruling on the Motion to
Void Non-Judicial Foreclosure Sale.  Put another way, the Circuit
Court determined that no relief could be granted because the Unit
had been properly sold pursuant to the rules regarding non-
judicial foreclosure of sale.  In AOAO's opposition to the Motion
to Void Non-Judicial Foreclosure Sale, it highlighted parts of
Article VI, section 4 of the Bylaws of Association of Apartment
Owners of Liona Kona ("Bylaws") to establish that it had the
requisite power of sale.  Article VI, section 4 of the Bylaws
provides, in relevant part:  
Default in Payment of Assessments. . . .  In the event
of a default or defaults in payment of any such assessment
or assessments and in addition to any other remedies herein
or by law provided, the Board [of the AOAO] may enforce each
such obligation as follows: 
(a) By suit or suits at law to enforce each such
assessment obligation. . . 
2/See Hawaii Ventures, LLC v. Otaka, Inc. , 114 Hawai #i 438, 500, 164
P.3d 696, 758 (2007) (quoting Kemp v. State of Hawai #i Child Support Enf't
Agency, 111 Hawai #i 
367, 391, 141 P.3d 1014, 1038 (2006)) ("As a general rule,
if a party does not raise an argument at the circuit court level, that
argument will be deemed to have been waived on appeal; this rule applies in
both criminal and civil cases." (internal quotation marks and brackets
omitted)).

(b) At any time upon the occurrence of any such
default, the Board . . . may give notice to the defaulting
apartment owner . . . . If such delinquency is not paidwithin thirty (30) days after delivery of such notice, theBoard may elect to file a claim of lien against theapartment of such delinquent apartment owner. . . . Uponrecordation of a duly executed original or copy of suchclaim of lien with the Bureau of Conveyances, the Boardshall have all remedies provided in Section 514A-90, HawaiiRevised Statutes, as amended. 
This court has previously ruled, while considering 
similar bylaws, that a non-judicial power of sale foreclosure of 
a condominium owner's unit by an association, like AOAO here, was not authorized because Hawaii Revised Statutes section 514A-90 did not grant associations power of sale over condominium units.
3/ See Sakal, 143 Hawai# i at 229-30, 426 P.3d at 453-54. 
Accordingly, AOAO's non-judicial power of sale foreclosure of Robert's Unit was not authorized by the Bylaws, and the Circuit Court improperly dismissed Roberts' Complaint and awarded judgment to AOAO. 
Therefore, we vacate the September 18, 2015 Order 
Granting the Motion to Dismiss and the September 18, 2015 Final Judgment entered by the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit, and remand this case for further proceedings.

nonjudicial power of sale foreclosure of the Property prior to the recordation
of the Affidavit and the Quitclaim Deed, Sakai [sic] is now barred by [HawaiiRevised Statutes] ยง 667-102(b)(2) from any claim to the Property itself. 143 
Hawai #i at 231, 426 P.3d at 455. Here, however, Roberts' Complaint
challenging the non-judicial power of sale foreclosure was filed onFebruary 4, 2015, while the AOAO filed its affidavit and quitclaim deed onApril 7 and April 8, 2015, respectively.
