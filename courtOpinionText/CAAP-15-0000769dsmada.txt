IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
RICARDO GARZA SALINAS, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
CHRISTINE N. LOMINARIO, Defendant-Appellant,
and
 
ALL OCCUPANTS, Defendants-Appellees
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 3RC15-1-0423)

 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Leonard, JJ.)

 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
jurisdiction over this appeal that Defendant-Appellant Christine
 
N. Lominario (Appellant Lominario) has asserted from the Honorable Harry P. Freitas's July 20, 2015 judgment for possession, because Appellant Lominario's October 22, 2015 notice of appeal is untimely under Rule 4(a)(3) of the Hawai
'i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) as to the July 20, 2015 judgment for possession. 
The July 20, 2015 judgment for possession is an
 
immediately appealable district court judgment pursuant to Hawaii
 Revised States (HRS) 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2015) and the
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
doctrine in Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848) (the Forgay 
doctrine). See Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai 'i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 
702, 704 (1995) (regarding the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine). 
Pursuant to HRCP Rule 4(a)(3), Appellant Lominario 
extended the initial thirty-day time period under HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) for filing a notice of appeal from the July 20, 2015 judgment for possession when Appellant Lominario served her July 23, 2015 post-judgment motion for reconsideration pursuant to District Court Rule of Civil Procedure (DCRCP) Rule 59 within ten days after entry of the July 20, 2015 judgment for possession, as DCRCP Rule 59 required for a timely post-judgment motion that invoked the tolling provision in HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) and extended the time period for filing a notice of appeal. HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) provides that when a party files a timely post-judgment motion for reconsideration of a judgment, "the time for filing the notice of appeal is extended until 30 days after entry of an order disposing of the motion[.]" See, e.g., Association 
of Condominium Homeowners of Tropics at Waikele v. Sakuma, 131 Hawai
'i 254, 256, 318 P.3d 94, 96 (2013). Consequently, the 
thirty-day time period under HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) for filing a notice of appeal from July 20, 2015 judgment for possession commenced upon entry of the district court's August 13, 2015 post-judgment order denying Appellant Lominario's July 23, 2015 DCRCP Rule 59 post-judgment motion for reconsideration of the July 20, 2015 judgment for possession. However, Appellant Lominario did not file her October 22, 2015 notice of appeal within thirty days after entry of the August 13, 2015 post-judgment order denying Appellant Lominario's July 23, 2015 DCRCP Rule 59 post-judgment motion for reconsideration of the July 20, 2015 judgment for possession, in violation of HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). Therefore, Lominario's appeal is not timely. The failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise of judicial discretion. Bacon 
v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP
 Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or justice is authorized to
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
change the jurisdictional requirements contained in Rule 4 of
 
these rules."); HRAP Rule 26(e) ("The reviewing court for good
 cause shown may relieve a party from a default occasioned by any
 failure to comply with these rules, except the failure to give
 timely notice of appeal."). Therefore, we lack appellate
 jurisdiction over Appellant Lominario's untimely appeal.
 
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
 
case number CAAP-15-0000769 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
