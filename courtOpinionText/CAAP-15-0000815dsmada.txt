Upon consideration of the "Stipulation for Dismissal of
 
Appeal With Prejudice," filed on March 17, 2017, by Defendant-
Appellant Association of Apartment Owners of Palm Villas II, the
 papers in support, and the record, it appears that (1) the appeal

 dismiss the appeal with prejudice, pursuant to Hawai

Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 42(b); (3) the stipulation is
 dated and signed by counsel for all parties appearing in the
  appeal; and (4) the parties agree to bear their own costs and
 
attorneys' fees but for those allocated by separate agreement. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the stipulation to
 
dismiss the appeal is approved and the appeal is dismissed with
 prejudice. The parties shall bear their own costs and attorneys'
 fees on appeal, but for those allocated by separate agreement as
 referenced in the March 17, 2017 stipulation.
