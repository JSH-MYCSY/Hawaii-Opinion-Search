(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Chan, JJ.)

1
six asset forfeiture cases  by the Circuit Court of the First
Circuit (Circuit Court).2 Petitioner-Appellant Keith M.

'i 
(Prosecuting Attorney), appeals from the following:

October 8, 2015 in each of the six cases.3
 
On appeal, the Prosecuting Attorney argues that the
 
Circuit Court erred in dismissing its Verified Petition for
 
Forfeiture (Judicial Petition) and/or granting summary judgment
 in favor of PJY because (1) the Prosecuting Attorney timely
 commenced its forfeiture proceedings pursuant to Hawaii Revised
 Statutes (HRS) §§ 712A-7 and -9 (2014); (2) the Judicial Petition
 did not violate the statute of limitations pursuant to HRS
 §§ 712A-17 (2014) and 701-108(2) (Supp. 2013); and (3) PJY's due
 process rights were not violated as a result of the forfeiture
 proceedings.
 
BACKGROUND
 
On September 26, 2012, the Honolulu Police Department
 
4
(HPD) obtained the "Search Warrant"  authorizing a search of six
locations of a business called the Winner'z Zone. The Search
 Warrant stated:
 
Affidavit having been made before me by Honolulu Police
Department Detective Aaron YOUNG that he has reason to
believe that the property described herein may be found at
the locations set forth herein and that it falls within
 those grounds indicated below by "XXX" (s) in that it is
property:
 
XXX obtained in violation of Section 712-1222 and Section 
712-1226 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes; 
XXX which is, or has been used as a means of committing
the offense of Promoting Gambling in the Second Degreein violation of Section 712-1222 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes and Possession of a Gambling Device inviolation of Section 712-1226 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes; 
XXX possessed or controlled in violation of Section 712­1222 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes and Section 12­1226 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes; and/or 
XXX which is evidence of the criminal offenses of 
Promoting Gambling in the Second Degree in violation
of Section 712-1222 and Possession of a GamblingDevice in violation of Section 712–1226 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes. 
and [] I am satisfied that there is probable cause to
believe that the property described herein is contained on
or within the premises described below and that the
foregoing grounds for application for issuance of the search
warrant exists[.]

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HPD executed the Search Warrant on September 27, 2012. 
As a result of the September 27 search, HPD recovered a total of
 
seventy-seven "Products Direct Sweepstakes Machines" (gaming
 machines) from the six Winner'z Zone locations. In the Return of
 Search Warrant, Detective Aaron Young, who executed the warrant,
 reported that all of the property taken pursuant to the
 September 26, 2012 Search Warrant, "will be retained in my
 custody subject to the order of this court or any court in which
 the offense in respect to which the property or things taken are
 triable."
 
As a result of the September 27, 2012 seizure, on 
October 12, 2012, PJY, among others, filed a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment, Injunctive Relief and Monetary Damages (2012 Dec Action) against the Prosecuting Attorney and HPD, among others, asking for a ruling that the seized gaming machines were "not in violation of Hawai
'i's gambling statutes, specifically 
Sec. 712-1222 and Sec. 712-1226 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes." 
On September 12, 2014, HPD created Incident Reports for
 
Forfeiture (2014 Incident Reports). Each 2014 Incident Report
 included a Forfeiture Summary which described the events leading
 up to, and the basis for, forfeiture of the property.
 
The 2014 Incident Reports also stated that notices of
 
seizure for forfeiture were mailed on September 17, 2014 to,
 among others, PJY at "their last known addresses."
5 The notices
 
stated that the gaming machines had "been seized pursuant to
 Chapter 712A, Forfeiture, Hawaii Revised Statutes" and indicate
 "SEIZURE DATE: 9/12/2014."
 
On September 19, 2014, HPD sent requests for forfeiture
 
to the Prosecuting Attorney, asking that "the property described
 in the accompanying Notice of Seizure for Forfeiture that was
 seized on 9-12-14 be considered for forfeiture," (HPD Requests
 for Forfeiture) attaching copies of the 2014 Incident Reports.
 
5
 Timely notice was disputed by PJY and the Circuit Court did not
resolve this issue in its Order Granting Summary Judgment.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

On September 22, 2014,  the Prosecuting Attorney filed
six Petitions for Administrative Forfeiture (Administrative 
Petitions) with the Department of the Attorney General, State of Hawai
'i (AG) pursuant to HRS § 712A-10(1) (2014), for the gaming 
machines and other property seized pursuant to the Search Warrant on September 27, 2012. On November 3, 2014, and in response to the six Administrative Petitions, PJY filed claims for the gaming 
7
machines  and requested judicial review of the administrative
forfeiture proceedings, pursuant to HRS § 712A-10(9) (2014). 
The
 
AG created and sent notices of PJY's claims and request to the
 Prosecuting Attorney on November 6, 2014 by United States Mail.
 
On December 19, 2014, the Prosecuting Attorney filed in

 
the Circuit Court Verified Petitions for Forfeiture (Judicial
 Petitions) for the gaming machines in each of the six cases,
 attaching, inter alia, (1) the Notice of Receipt of Claim and In
 Pauperis Bond dated November 6, 2014; (2) the HPD Requests for
 Forfeiture; (3) the 2014 Incident Reports; and (4) the notices of
 seizure for forfeiture. The Judicial Petitions state:
 
The timeline [(sic)] of the Forfeiture Act has been
satisfied as follows:
 
a. 	The subject property was initially seized for
forfeiture on or about September 27, 2012 in the City
and County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii under [the
2012 HPD Police Report]. Due to time constraints the
 
forfeiture investigation under that report number was
cancelled. The subject property was re-seized for
forfeiture on or about September 12, 2014 in the City
and County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii under [the
2014 HPD Incident Report].
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
On January 21, 2015, PJY filed, in each of the six 
forfeiture cases, "[PJY's] Motion to Dismiss Verified Petition 
for Forfeiture Filed on December 19, 2014" based on Hawai 'i Rules 
of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rules 7, 12(b)(6), and 56 and Rules of the Circuit Courts of the State of Hawai
'i Rule 7 (Motions to 
6
 PJY acknowledged this event and date in its Memorandum of Law in
support of its Motions to Dismiss/Summary Judgment.
 
7
 While in the Administrative Petitions the Prosecuting Attorney
sought to forfeit other seized property in addition to the gaming machines,
PJY only made claims on the gaming machines. It appears that the Circuit
Court granted PJY's Motion to Dismiss/Summary Judgment as to the gaming
machines only.
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Dismiss/Summary Judgment). PJY requested that the Circuit Court
 
grant summary judgment in its favor if the Circuit Court believed
 that the matter should be converted from a HRCP Rule 12(b)(6)
 motion to dismiss to a HRCP Rule 56 motion for summary judgment.
 PJY maintained that the Prosecuting Attorney failed to comply
 with the notice requirements of HRS § 712A-7, arguing:
 
Sec. 712A-7(3), H.R.S., requires the seizing agency to make
reasonable efforts to give notice of seizure for forfeiture
to all parties known to have an interest in the seized
property within twenty days after seizure for forfeiture.
The seizure occurred on September 27, 2012 and the notice,
which is not in the four corners of the Petition, was not
given until September 15, 2014
8.[]

PJY asserted that, Tracy Yoshimura, a member of PJY, claimed to
 
have "never received any such mailing" from HPD. In sum, PJY
 argued that the HPD's notice of seizure for forfeiture was
 untimely under either the September 27, 2012 "seizure for
 forfeiture" date or the September 12, 2014 "seizure for
 forfeiture" date.
 
In opposition, the Prosecuting Attorney argued that
 
(1) the gaming machines were not seized for forfeiture until
 September 12, 2014; (2) HRS §§ 712A-9 and -17 authorized the
 seizure and reseizure of property; (3) PJY received actual notice
 
9
from HPD no later than October 12, 2012;  and (4) any
8 The Motions to Dismiss/Summary Judgment filed in CAAP-15-0000849,
CAAP-15-0000852, and CAAP-15-0000855 maintain that the notices of seizure for
forfeiture were not given until "September 16, 2014, at the earliest." The
 Motion to Dismiss/Summary Judgment filed in CAAP-15-0000850 maintains that the
notice of seizure for forfeiture was not given until "September 12, 2014, at
the earliest." The Motion to Dismiss/Summary Judgment filed in CAAP-15­0000854 maintains that the notice of seizure for forfeiture was not given
until "September 17, 2014, at the earliest." These dates, however, do not
coincide with the dates contained in the 2014 Incident Reports attached to the
Prosecuting Attorney's Memorandum in Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss/
Summary Judgment nor the Declaration of Dean Okinaga, the detective who
declared he sent the notices of seizure for forfeiture of the gaming machines
to PJY by certified mail at "known addresses" on September 15, 2014.
 
9
 In support of the Prosecuting Attorney's claim that PJY received
notice that the gaming machines were seized no later than October 12, 2012,
the Prosecuting Attorney cites to PJY's 2012 Dec Action filed on October 12,
2012 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit, wherein PJY acknowledged that
the gaming machines were seized on September 27, 2012, pursuant to search
warrant, S.W. 2012-238. PJY prayed for, inter alia, a declaratory judgment
stating that the Prosecuting Attorney's seizure of the gaming machines
violated PJY's constitutional rights and that the gaming machines did not
violate HRS §§ 712-1222 and -1226.
 
It appears that this action was subsequently removed to the United

(continued...)

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
noncompliance with HRS § 712A-7, did not adversely impact PJY. 
In response, PJY argued inter alia that (1) the Prosecuting
 Attorney violated the clear and unambiguous requirements of HRS
 § 712A-7; (2) while PJY received notice from HPD that the gaming
 machines had been seized, they did not receive notice that gaming
 machines had been seized with the intent to forfeit the property;
 and (3) whether PJY suffered any adverse effects from the non­compliance with HRS § 712A-7 was not relevant.
 
The Circuit Court held a consolidated hearing on the
 
Motions to Dismiss/Summary Judgment on March 3, 2015 and
 March 31, 2015. Based on its determination that the seizure for
 forfeiture occurred on September 27, 2012, the Circuit Court
 orally ruled as follows:
 
With regards to the dismissal, the Court denies the
motion to dismiss since 712A-17 of the forfeiture statute
 
sets forth the statute of limitations, and there's been no
showing at this point that the statute of limitations have
[sic] expired. And that was the same reasoning that was
given in United States vs. [James Daniel Good Real Property,
510 U.S. 43 (1993)].
 
Addressing the defendant's motion for summary
judgment, the Court grants partial summary judgment as it

relates to the seizure of the machines. Again, the reason
why it's partial summary judgment is because there are other
materials, such as the money and the camera, that hasn't -­that's still outstanding. But the Court grants the motion
for summary judgment with regards to the machines
.
 
On April 6, 2015, the Circuit Court called the parties
 
together to modify this ruling, stating:
 
In this particular case, the offenses for which the
property was subject to forfeiture was Promoting Gambling in
the Second Degree, Gambling, and Possession of a Gambling
Device. All of them were misdemeanors.
 
Clearly from the verified petition, the subject -- the
subject property was initially seized for forfeiture on
September 27, 2012. That being the case, statute of
limitations is two years. It should have – the filing of the
petition should have been September 27th, 2014. However, the
petition wasn't filed until December 19, 2014. 
9(...continued)
States District Court for the District of Hawai' i (District Court) in Civil
No. 12-00577 LEK-KSC. On March 24, 2017, the Prosecuting Attorney under
Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(j), filed with this court a copy
of the March 9, 2017 memorandum decision by the United States Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit affirming the District Court's grant of summary judgment
in favor of, inter alia, the Prosecuting Attorney on the issues raised,
including whether the gaming machines were gambling devices within the meaning
of HRS § 712-1220.
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
So therefore, the Court in correcting its order is
also granting the motion to dismiss because the petition
should have been filed by September 27th, not December 19th,
2014.
 
On April 6, 2015, the Circuit Court reduced its verbal
 
10
rulings to writing in its Order Granting Motion,  concluding:
42. [sic] According to the [Prosecuting Attorney's]
pleadings, the police cancelled [2012 HPD Police Report],
did not return the seized property to [PJY], did not file
any criminal charges, and waited over approximately two
(2) years to allegedly "re-seized" the property, under [2014
Incident Report]. The property remained in police custody
due to forfeiture "time constraints."
 
44.
 The Court finds and concludes that the
 
[Prosecuting Attorney's] argument that HPD "re-seized" the
property on September 19, 2014 is disingenuous.
 
45. Here, the [Prosecuting Attorney's] own Petition
admits that HPD actually seized the property on
September 27, 2012, that the seizure was for the purposes of
forfeiture, and due to time constraints, HPD "cancelled" the
[2012 HPD Police Report].
 
46. Moreover, [the 2014 Incident Report] documenting
the seizure states that the seizure occurred on
 September 27, 2012 at the "Winner'z Zone" . . . , that the
seizure was based on probable cause that the criminal
offenses of Promoting Gambling in the Second Degree,
Gambling, and Possession of a Gambling Device had been
committed, and that the property seized was subject to
forfeiture pursuant to H.R.S. Chapter 712A.
 
47. The Court finds and concludes that if it were to
 
follow and uphold the [Prosecuting Attorney's] contention
that the seizure for forfeiture had occurred on
 September 19, 2014, the Court in essence would be validating
a falsity and undermining the purpose of H.R.S. Chapter
712A.
 
48. Therefore, the Court finds and concludes that, the
[Prosecuting Attorney] having failed to commence its
Verified Petition for Forfeiture within the period in which
a criminal proceeding may be instituted for a covered
offense pursuant to section 701-108, the Court grants [PJY
Enterprises'] Motion to Dismiss.
 
49. Addressing [PJY's] alternative request for Summary
Judgment, the Court grants the Claimant's request for
Summary Judgment. Here, the Court finds and concludes that
in delaying the commencement of forfeiture proceedings, the
[Prosecuting Attorney] violated the [PJY's] Due Process
Rights.
 
(Emphasis omitted.)
 
The Prosecuting Attorney moved for reconsideration,
 
attaching the declaration of Deputy Prosecutor Kurt Nakamatsu
 
10
 The Orders Granting Motion in the other five cases were filed on
April 7, 2015.
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that reiterated the Prosecuting Attorney's characterization of
 
the time line of events, maintained that "[f]orfeiture
 proceedings commenced on September 22, 2014 when the [Prosecuting
 Attorney] filed its [Administrative Petition] with the [AG] which
 is less than two (2) years after any seizure for forfeiture in
 this case and within the time limitations set forth in 
HRS §
 
712A-17[,]" and supported by, inter alia, a copy of the
 respective Administrative Petitions.
 
PJY opposed the Motions for Reconsideration, arguing
 
that the Prosecuting Attorney's motions should not be considered
 because they were based on matters previously known. PJY also
 argued that, even if the Circuit Court considered the
 Administrative Petitions, the Prosecuting Attorney's forfeiture
 action was still untimely.
 
The Circuit Court orally denied the motions, citing to
 
HRS § 712A-10:
 
I dismissed the verified petition because the verified
petition was filed after –- two years after the statute of
limitations from the seizure. I didn't dismiss the
 administrative. But if you look under 712A-10 and if you
proceed with a judicial, the judicial proceeding, if any,
shall adjudicate all timely filed claims, in which case by
me dismissing the judicial proceeding as being violation of
701-108, 712A, subsection 17, at that point, it terminates
the administrative proceedings. I mean, that's what 712A-10
says, a judicial proceeding, if any, shall adjudicate all
timely filed claims. And that's assuming that this claim,
the administrative petition was timely filed.
 
. . . .

 
So even if the court were to assume that the
 
administrative petition was filed within the two-year
period, the judicial takes care of the administrative.
 
. . . .
 
In this particular case, you chose to go
administratively, okay. You could have chosen judicially
and just foreclosed the attorney generals from even
addressing it. But by choosing the administrative
forfeiture route, at that point, . . . 712A-10 kicks in, in
which case it says that if judicial proceedings is
instituted subsequent to the notice of the administrative
forfeiture, okay, the judicial proceeding, if any, shall
adjudicate all timely filed claims. So at that point, the
statute clearly states that the judicial takes precedence
over the administrative. So now you cannot come back and
say, well, oh, boy, we want to go administrative. You had a
 choice. You could have proceeded administratively and forgo
the judicial, or you could have just gone judicial but file
it within the two years. By filing it in December, that's
way over the two years.
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
On April 21, 2015, the Circuit Court reduced its
 
decision to writing, ruling that under HRS §§ 712A-7 and -9, "any
 
administrative or judicial forfeiture proceedings should have
 been commenced by December 12, 2012[,]" and concluding that the
 Judicial Petitions "violated the statute of limitation provisions
 under H.R.S. § 712A-17 and H.R.S. § 701-108(2)." Notably, in its
 Orders Denying Reconsideration, the Circuit Court also took the

 
opportunity to sua sponte elaborate on the rulings that it made
 in its Orders Granting Motion, stating not only that the evidence
 supported the finding that the seizure of the gaming machines
 occurred on September 27, 2012, but for the first time finding
 that the seizure was "coupled with an assertion by the seizing
 agency or by a prosecuting attorney that the property is subject
 to forfeiture".
 
The Circuit Court entered its Judgments on October 8,
 
2015, from which the Prosecuting Attorney timely appealed.

DISCUSSION
 
A. 	The Circuit Court Erred in Ruling the Judicial Petitions
Were Untimely.
 
Hawaii's Forfeiture statute provides that a "seizure
 
for forfeiture" triggers a series of events necessary for the
 
forfeiture of property. See generally HRS §§ 712A-7, -9, -10, 
-11 (2014). A "seizure for forfeiture" is a "seizure of property
 by a law enforcement officer coupled with an assertion by the
 seizing agency or by a prosecuting attorney that the property is
 subject to forfeiture." HRS § 712A-1 (2014).
11 Therefore, a
 
"seizure for forfeiture" consists of two parts: (1) the seizure
 of property by a law enforcement officer and (2) an "assertion"
 that the property is "subject to forfeiture by the seizing
 agency
12 or prosecuting attorney."13
 
11
 Contrast this definition with that of a "seizure for evidence"
 
which is a "seizure of property by a law enforcement officer." HRS § 712A-1.
 
12
 HRS § 712A-1 defines "seizing agency" as follows:
 
"Seizing agency" means any department or agency of
this State or its political subdivisions which regularly
employs law enforcement officers, and which employed the law
enforcement officer who seized property for forfeiture, or
such other agency as the seizing agency may designate in a
(continued...)
 
11

HRS § 712A-7(3) provides that, following a "seizure for
 
forfeiture," the seizing agency must (1) conduct an inventory and
 
estimate the value of the seized property as soon as practicable,
 (2) make reasonable efforts to give notice of seizure for
 forfeiture to interested parties within twenty days, and, under
 HRS § 712A-7(4), (3) send a written request for forfeiture to the
 prosecuting attorney within thirty days.
14 The prosecuting
 
attorney then determines whether it is probable that the property
 is subject to forfeiture, HRS § 712A-9(1),
15 and if so, may
 
initiate forfeiture proceedings by bringing either administrative
 or judicial proceedings against the property within forty-five
 days after receiving the seizing agency's written request for
 forfeiture. 
Id. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Chapter 712A
 
provides a statute of limitations for forfeiture proceedings,
 which is equal to the period of limitations for the corresponding
 
12(...continued)
particular case by its chief executive officer or designee.

 
13 HRS § 712A-1 defines "prosecuting attorney" as follows:
 
"Prosecuting attorney" means the prosecuting attorney
or deputy prosecuting attorneys of the various counties, or
the attorney general or deputy attorneys general when
engaged in the prosecution of a criminal offense.
 
14 § 712A-7 Power and duties of law enforcement officers and
agencies. . . .
 
(3) As soon as practicable after seizure for
forfeiture, the seizing agency shall conduct an inventory
and estimate the value of the property seized. Within twenty
days after seizure for forfeiture the seizing agency shall
make reasonable efforts to give notice of seizure for
forfeiture in the manner provided in section 712A-8(a) or
712A-8(b) to all parties known to have an interest in the
seized property.
 
(4) In the event of a seizure for forfeiture under
section 712A-6, the seizing agency shall send to a
prosecuting attorney a written request for forfeiture within
thirty days, which shall include a statement of facts and
circumstances of the seizure, the appraised or estimated
value of the property, and a summary of the facts relied on
for forfeiture.
 
15
 § 712A-9 Commencement proceedings. (1) The
prosecuting attorney shall determine whether it is
probable that the property is subject to forfeiture
and, if so, shall initiate administrative or judicial
proceedings against the property within forty-five
days of receipt of a written request for forfeiture
from a seizing agency.

covered offense. HRS § 712A-17 (2014).16
 
If the prosecuting attorney decides to pursue
 
administrative forfeiture proceedings against the seized
 
property, the filing, notice, and processing requirements
 provided in HRS § 712A-10 govern. As pertinent here, the
 prosecuting attorney must file a petition with the attorney
 general and make reasonable efforts to serve a copy on all
 persons known to have an interest in the property; the attorney
 general gives notice, by publication, of the intent to forfeit
 the property administratively. HRS 712A-10(1), (2), (3). 
Persons claiming an interest in the property may file a claim and
 bond and may request judicial review of the seizure and
 administrative forfeiture proceedings. HRS § 712A-10(4), (9).
17
  
16 § 712A-17 Limitation of actions. Notwithstanding
any other provision of law, forfeiture proceedings
under this chapter may be commenced at any time within
the period in which a criminal proceeding may be
instituted for a covered offense pursuant to section
701-108.
 
In this case, the Search Warrant identified the offenses under
investigation as HRS § 712-1222 (2014), Promoting Gambling in the Second
Degree and HRS §712-1226 (2014), Possession of a Gambling Device. Both
 offenses are misdemeanors, id., and misdemeanors have a two-year limitation
period. HRS § 701-108(2)(e). 
17 § 712A-10 Administrative Forfeiture. . . . 
(4)	 Persons claiming an interest in the property may
file either a petition for remission or
mitigation of forfeiture, or a claim and cost or
in pauperis bond, but not both, with the
attorney general, within thirty days of notice
by publication or receipt of written notice,
whichever is earlier. Notwithstanding section
1-29, the thirty-day time period prescribed
herein is computed by excluding the first day
and including the last day, unless the last day
is a Saturday, Sunday or holiday and then it is
also excluded, and the thirty-day time period
runs until the end of the next day which is not
a Saturday, Sunday or a holiday. "Holiday"
includes any day designated as a holiday
pursuant to section 8-1.
 
. . . .
 
(9)	 Any person claiming seized property may seek
judicial review of the seizure and proposed
forfeiture by timely filing with the attorney
general a claim and bond to the State in the
amount of ten per cent of the estimated value of
the property or in the sum of $2,500, whichever

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
If the attorney general receives a claim and bond, it must notify
 
the prosecuting attorney who, in his or her discretion, may
 continue to seek forfeiture by petitioning the circuit court
 within forty-five days of receipt of the notice. HRS § 712A­10(9). If the prosecuting attorney thereafter institutes
 judicial forfeiture proceedings, "no duplicate or repetitive
 notice shall be required" and the judicial proceeding is to
 "adjudicate all timely filed claims." HRS § 712A-10(10).
18
 
PJY argued in its Motion to Dismiss/Summary Judgment
 
that the Judicial Petitions should be dismissed "because
 [Prosecuting Attorney] has not complied with the time limitations
 under Chapter 712A."
19 The Prosecuting Attorney argued that the 
17(...continued)
 
is greater, with sureties to be approved by the
attorney general, upon condition that if the
claimant fails to prove that claimant's interest
is exempt from forfeiture under section 712A-5,
the claimant shall pay the State's costs and
expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees
incurred in connection with a judicial
proceeding. In lieu of a cost bond, a claimant
may file an in pauperis bond sworn on oath
before a notary public. An in pauperis bond
shall be in the form set out in the appendix to
the rules of penal procedure. The claim shall be
signed by the claimant and sworn on oath before
a notary public and shall comply with the
requirements of section 712A-12(5). Upon receipt
of the claim and bond, the attorney general
shall notify the prosecuting attorney who may
discretionarily continue to seek forfeiture by
petitioning the circuit court for forfeiture of
the property within forty-five days of receipt
of notice that a proper claim and bond has been
filed. The prosecuting attorney may also elect
to honor the claim in which case the prosecuting
attorney shall notify the seizing agency and
authorize the release of the seizure for
 forfeiture on the property or on any specified
interest in it.
 
18	 HRS § 712A-10(10) provides, in pertinent part:
 
(10)	 If a judicial forfeiture proceeding is instituted
subsequent to notice of administrative forfeiture
pursuant to paragraph (9), no duplicate or repetitive
notice shall be required. The judicial proceeding, if
any, shall adjudicate all timely filed claims[.]

 While styling its motion as one to dismiss under HRCP
Rule 12(b)(6), PJY also argued, for the same reasons, that summary judgment in
its favor was warranted in the event that the Circuit Court decided to treat
 its motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment. The Circuit Court
 decided the motion under both HRCP Rule 12(b)(6) and HRCP Rule 56. However,

gaming machines were initially seized on September 27, 2012, as
 
evidence of criminal charges and re-seized for forfeiture
 purposes on September 12, 2014, as allowed under HRS 712A-9 and ­17. In summary, the Circuit Court found that on September 27,
 2012, pursuant to the September 26, 2012 Search Warrant, the
 gaming machines were seized and, relying on the statements in the
 2014 Forfeiture Summaries by HPD and the allegations in the
 Judicial Petitions by the Prosecuting Attorney that the gaming
 machines were "initially seized for forfeiture on or about
 September 27, 2012," concluded there were no genuine issues of
 material fact, and that PJY was entitled to judgment as a matter
 of law.
 
On appeal, an order of summary judgment is reviewed
under the same standard applied by the circuit courts.
Summary judgment is proper where the moving party
demonstrates that there are no genuine issues of material
fact and it is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.
In other words, summary judgment is appropriate if the
pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and
admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,
show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and the
moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.

Ltd., 4 Haw. App. 210, 214, 664 P.2d 745, 749 (1983). 
Both PJY and the Prosecuting Attorney presented matters outside
the pleadings for the Circuit Court's consideration. As the Circuit Court did
 not explicitly exclude these documents from consideration in reaching its
ruling that the "seizure for forfeiture" occurred on September 27, 2012, it
was required to treat PJY's motion as one for summary judgment. See Morioka

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Assuming for the purposes of this appeal that the
 
September 27, 2012 seizure triggered the process established in
 
Chapter 712A, these forfeiture proceedings, initiated by the
 filing of the Administrative Petitions within the limitations
 period, were timely.
 
As we have observed, under HRS § 712A-17, the period of
 
limitations was fixed by the time limits for prosecuting the
 covered offenses in HRS §701-108. The covered offenses here were
 Promoting Gambling in the Second Degree HRS § 712-1222, and
 Possession of a Gambling Device, HRS § 712-1226. Both of these
 offenses are misdemeanors, id., for which prosecution may be
 brought within two years. Under HRS § 712A-9, Commencement of
 proceedings, the Prosecuting Attorney had the option to commence
 forfeiture proceedings by filing administrative or judicial
 forfeiture petitions. The Prosecuting Attorney opted to file
 administrative petitions. As it is undisputed that the
 Administrative Petitions were filed with the AG on September 22,
 2014, which was within the two years of the September 27, 2012
 seizure, these petitions were timely.
 
It appears that the Circuit Court interpreted Chapter
 
712A as requiring a timely filing--i.e., within two years of
 seizure--of both the Administrative Petitions and the Judicial
 Petitions, or else requiring that the Prosecuting Attorney opt
 for one proceeding to the exclusion of the other.
21 We do not
 
20(...continued)
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on
file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there
is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the
moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.
A summary judgment, interlocutory in character, may be
rendered on the issue of liability alone although there is a
genuine issue as to the amount of damages.
 
21
 The Circuit Court concluded, 
75. Finally, nothing prevented the Prosecuting
Attorney from filing its [Judicial Petition] by
September 27, 2014. Clearly under H.R.S. §712A-9, the State
[sic] could have proceeded with a judicial forfeiture
proceeding. Instead, the Prosecuting Attorney strategically
chose to proceed via an Administrative Forfeiture
Proceeding.
 
76. In choosing to proceed via an administrative
forfeiture proceeding, the State [sic] cannot now claim that

(continued...)
 
16

agree.
 
Where a prosecuting attorney brings an administrative
 
petition, HRS §712A-9 provides that where, as here, a claimant
 
files a qualifying claim and requests judicial review of an
 administrative forfeiture petition, upon notice from the AG, the
 prosecuting attorney may "discretionarily continue to seek
 forfeiture by petitioning the circuit court for forfeiture of the
 property," HRS § 712A-10(9) (emphasis added), and if the
 prosecuting attorney chooses to do so, "no duplicate or
 repetitive notice shall be required [and the] judicial
 proceeding, if any, shall adjudicate all timely filed claims." 
HRS § 712A-10(10). This procedure supports the notion that when
 an administrative petition becomes contested, the prosecuting
 attorney may continue the forfeiture process by filing a judicial
 petition. Under these circumstances, the judicial petition is
 not a new proceeding, but a continuation of a preexisting one,
 and bringing the administrative petition within the limitations
 period satisfies that requirement. Thus, the Circuit Court erred
 when it ruled the Judicial Petitions were untimely.
 
Finally, the Circuit Court also found the petitions
 
untimely because they were not filed within the time limits
 prescribed in HRS §712A-7 and -9. Those provisions require the
 seizing agency to send a request for forfeiture to the
 prosecuting attorney within thirty days of seizure and require
 the prosecuting attorney who determines it is probable that the
 property is subject to forfeiture to file the petition within
 forty-five days of the request.
 
However, neither provision sets penalties for violation
 
of these deadlines. Moreover, to treat them as setting the outer
 limit for bringing forfeiture actions seems to be inconsistent
 with the provision that explicitly defines the limitations
 period. HRS § 712A-17 states that "notwithstanding any other
 provision of law, the forfeiture proceedings under this chapter
 
21(...continued)
it had forty-five (45) days, after receiving the November 6,
2014 notice, to commence judicial proceedings beyond the two

(2) year statute of limitations under H.R.S. §712A-17 and
H.R.S. §701-108(2).
 
17
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
may be commenced at any time within the period in which a
 
criminal proceeding may be instituted for a covered offense
 pursuant to section 701-108." (Emphasis added.) To require the
 dismissal of a petition which is filed within this limitation
 period because other internal deadlines are not met would be
 inconsistent with the clear dictates of HRS § 712A-17.
 
The Supreme Court in United States v. James Daniel Good
 
Real Prop., 510 U.S. 43 (1993), reached the same result under a
 similar statutory scheme. There, seizure for forfeiture of real
 property was instituted four and one-half years after Good was
 arrested and marijuana was found on the property. Id. at 47. 
The action was filed within the five-year limitations period, but
 did not comply with the internal timing requirements of the
 applicable statute. Id. at 63. The Supreme Court relied on
 
earlier decisions that held if the statute does not specify
 consequences for noncompliance with statutory timing
 requirements, the courts would not impose its own coercive
 sanctions. Id. Consequently, the Court held that "courts may
 
not dismiss a forfeiture action filed within the 5-year statute
 of limitations for noncompliance with the internal timing
 requirements of [19 U.S.C.] §§ 1602–1604. The Government filed
 the action in this case within the 5-year statute of limitations,
 and that sufficed to make it timely." Id. at 65.
 
Given the express language enacted by our legislature
 
regarding the timing of forfeiture actions, we agree that the
 failure to comply with the internal deadlines contained in HRS
 §712A will not serve as a bar for petition brought within the
 limitation provision contained in HRS §712A-17.
B.	 The Circuit Court Erred in Granting Summary Judgment for a
Violation of Due Process.
 
The Prosecuting Attorney also challenges the Circuit
 
Court's decision to grant PJY's alternative motion for summary
 
judgment on due process grounds. The Circuit Court, relying on
 Good, and the analytical framework in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424
 U.S. 319 (1976), ruled against the Prosecuting Attorney as a
 matter of law, concluding that "the government failed to provide
 the Court with any 'extraordinary' reasons justifying a
 
18
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
postponement of the forfeiture proceedings and that the private
 
interest of [PJY] outweighs the Government's failure to comply
 with the timing requirements under H.R.S. Chapter 712A."
 
Good was a real property forfeiture case where no
 
notice of forfeiture was given to the owners of the property
 before seizure. In Mathews, a recipient of disability benefits
 argued that he was entitled to a hearing before an initial
 termination of benefits prior to review.
 
Initially, we note that the Mathews factor-analysis
 
requires identification of the interests of the individual and
 the government. Mathews, 424 U.S. at 333 ("[R]esolution of the
 
issue whether the administrative procedures provided here are
 constitutionally sufficient requires analysis of the governmental
 and private interests that are affected."). Such an analysis
 does not lend itself to an "as a matter of law" determination. 
More importantly, the issue in both Good and Mathews
 
was the necessity of pre-deprivation notice and opportunity to be
 heard, not delay in bringing post-seizure proceedings. Good, 510
 
U.S. at 46; Mathews, 424 U.S. at 333. In Good, there was a four
 and one-half year delay between the seizure and the institution
 of forfeiture proceedings. While the Court considered the delay
 in the context of the statutory time limitations, it did not rest
 its due process analysis on this delay. In Mathews, post-
deprivation delay was not an issue.
 
Finally, we note that whatever the interests of the
 
parties in a pre-deprivation notice and hearing procedure--which
 the Circuit Court did not address--on the undisputed facts in
 this case, PJY had actual notice that its property had been
 seized and exercised its options to contest that seizure by
 bringing the 2012 Dec Action two weeks after the 2012 seizure
 occurred and in November 2014 when it timely filed its claims
 against the Administrative Petitions. In the former, PJY was
 able to assert its defense that the gaming machines were not
 gambling devices and in the latter, PJY has been able to force
 contested forfeiture proceedings before the Circuit Court. On
 these facts, we cannot say that, as a matter of law, PJY was
 deprived of notice and an opportunity to be heard. See e.g.,

People ex rel. Kelly v. $16,500 in U.S. Currency, 4 N.E.3D 570
