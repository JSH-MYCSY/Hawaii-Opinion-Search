Plea/Judgment in 1DTC-14-070286, and (2) the Judgment and Notice
 of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment in 1DTC-15­032645, both filed on October 7, 2015 (Judgments), in the
 
District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division (District

Meyer states her single point of error on appeal as: 
"Whether 'operating a motor vehicle without first being
 
appropriately examined and duly licensed as a qualified driver'
 includes driving with an expired license?" Meyer argues that the
 plain language contained in the statute and the charge does not
 prohibit driving with an expired license. She further argues
 that the statute is at least ambiguous and must be interpreted in
 her favor based on the rule of lenity.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Meyer's point of error as follows:
 
HRS § 286-102(a) states, in relevant part:
 
§ 286-102 Licensing.  (a) . . . No person, except
one:
 
(1)	 Exempted under section 286-105;
(2)	 Who holds an instruction permit under section
286-110;
(3)	 Who holds a limited purpose driver's license,
limited purpose provisional driver's license, or
limited purpose instruction permit under section
286-104.5;
(4)	 Who holds a provisional license under section
286-102.6;
(5)	 Who holds a commercial driver's license issued
 under section 286-239; or
(6)	 Who holds a commercial driver's license
 
 
instruction permit issued under section 286-236,
shall operate any category of motor vehicles listed in this
section without first being appropriately examined and duly
licensed as a qualified driver of that category of motor
vehicles.
 
HRS § 286-102(a) is relatively straightforward and
 
requires, in pertinent part, that an individual be "appropriately
 
examined" and "duly licensed as a qualified driver" when
 operating a motor vehicle. "Duly licensed" plainly means
 licensed in accordance with the applicable motor vehicle
 licensing law, which includes an expiration date.

See HRS § 286-106 (Supp. 2015). Meyer acknowledges that an
 
expired license is not valid and that hers expired in 2011. 
Similarly, "appropriately examined" plainly means examined, or
 tested, in the manner provided by the applicable driver's license
 examination law. See HRS § 286-108 (Supp. 2015). Meyer's
 
argument, that because HRS § 286-102(a) does not specifically
 state that one cannot drive with an expired license, driving with
 an expired license is not prohibited, is without merit.
 
We conclude that the requirements of HRS § 286-102(a)
 
are clear, and not ambiguous. Thus, the rule of lenity does not
 apply.
 
Accordingly, the District Court's October 7, 2015
 
Judgments are affirmed.
