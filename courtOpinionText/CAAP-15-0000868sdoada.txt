IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI #I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
CONTANGENT EZRA, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(Honolulu Division)
(CASE NO. 1DCW-15-0002529)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
After a bench trial, the District Court of the First
Circuit (District Court)1 found Defendant-Appellant Contangent
Ezra (Ezra) guilty as charged of second-degree criminal trespass,
in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 708-814(1)(b)
(2014).  The District Court sentenced Ezra to six months of
probation, subject to the condition that he serve three days in
jail.  The District Court entered its Judgment on October 12,
2015. 
On appeal, Ezra contends that his conviction should be
vacated because the District Court failed to properly advise him
of his right to testify pursuant to Tachibana v. State, 79
Hawai#i 226, 900 P.2d 1293 (1995), and failed to obtain a valid
waiver of his right to testify.  We agree.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2We conclude that the District Court erred in failing to
properly advise Ezra of his rights as required by Tachibana .  The
District Court failed to advise Ezra that he had a right to
testify and that if he wanted to testify, no one could prevent
him from doing so.  See Tachibana , 79 Hawai #i at 236 n.7, 900
P.2d at 1303 n.7.  The record also indicates that English was not
Ezra's first language, as he requested and was provided with an
interpreter.  See State v. Han , 130 Hawai #i 83, 92-93, 306 P.3d
128, 137-38 (2013) (concluding that the defendant's language
barrier was a "salient fact" that implicated the importance of
proper questioning to confirm that the defendant understood his
rights).   
Under the circumstances of this case, we conclude that
the District Court did not obtain a valid waiver from Ezra of his
right to testify.  Ezra did not testify and we cannot say that
the District Court's Tachibana  error was harmless.  See State v.
Hoang, 94 Hawai #i 271, 279-80, 12 P.3d 371, 379-80 (App. 2000). 
Accordingly, we vacate the District Court's Judgment
and remand the case for a new trial.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawaii, October 27, 2016.
