Upon review of the record, it appears that: 
(1) On March 24, 2016, the court ordered Defendant-
Appellant Michael-Francis L. Correa's counsel, Angela-Jo Lokalia
 Correa-Pei (Counsel), to show cause, within ten days from the
 date of the order, indicating why the appeal should not be
 dismissed for failure to file the opening brief, and why she
 failed to file the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief,
 or request an extension of time. The court cautioned Counsel
 that failure to timely respond to the order or to show good cause
 may result in sanctions, including, without limitation, monetary
 sanctions and/or the appeal being dismissed; and
