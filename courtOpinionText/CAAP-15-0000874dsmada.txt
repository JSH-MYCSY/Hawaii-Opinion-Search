APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

ORDER
 
DISMISSING APPELLATE COURT CASE NUMBER
 
CAAP-15-0000874 FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
AND
 
DISMISSING ALL PENDING MOTIONS AS MOOT
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record on appeal, it appears that we

 
lack appellate jurisdiction over Defendants/Counterclaim­
Plaintiffs/Third-Party Plaintiffs/Appellants Shanghai Shanghai,
 LLC, dba Maui Kitchen, and Ronald Au's (the Appellants) appeal
 from 
•	 five interlocutory orders in the Circuit Court of the
First Circuit (Circuit Court) Civil No. 14-1-2398-11
(KKS), the Honorable Karl K. Sakamoto presiding (the
Circuit Court Orders), and
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
•	 two interlocutory orders in the Honolulu Division of
the District Court of the First Circuit (District
Court) Civil No. 1RC14-1-7371, the Honorable Michael K.
Tanigawa presiding (the District Court Orders),
 
because the respective courts have not yet finally adjudicated
 
all of the remaining substantive claims, as Hawaii Revised
 Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2015) requires.
 
With respect to the Circuit Court Orders, HRS § 641­
1(a) authorizes appeals from civil circuit court cases to the Hawai
'i Intermediate Court of Appeals from final judgments, 
orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641­1(c). Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) 
requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." "An appeal may be taken from circuit court orders resolving claims against parties only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 
115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). "Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai
'i 245, 
254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008); Bailey v. DuVauchelle, 135 Hawai
'i 482, 489, 353 P.3d 1024, 1031 (2015). When interpreting 
the requirements for an appealable final judgment under 
- 2 ­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
HRS § 641-1(a) and HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai 'i has 
explained that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on
its face all of the issues in the case, the burden

of searching the often voluminous circuit court
record to verify assertions of jurisdiction is
cast upon this court. Neither the parties nor
counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for
evidence of finality, . . . and we should not make
such searches necessary by allowing the parties
the option of waiving the requirements of HRCP
[Rule] 58. 
Jenkins
, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (citation omitted; 
original emphasis). Consequently, "an order disposing of a 
circuit court case is appealable when the order is reduced to a separate judgment." Alford v. City and Count of Honolulu, 109 
Hawai
'i 14, 20, 122 P.3d 809, 815 (2005) (citation omitted; 
emphasis added). "An appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Jenkins, 76 
Hawai
'i at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote omitted). 
On December 28, 2015, the Circuit Court clerk filed the
 
record on appeal for appellate court case number CAAP-15-0000874,
 which does not contain a final judgment on all of the claims in
 Civil No. 14-1-2398-11. Absent an appealable final judgment on
 all of the claims in Civil No. 14-1-2398-11, we lack appellate
 jurisdiction to review the five Circuit Court Orders for which
 the Appellants seek appellate review.

With respect to the two District Court Orders from
 
which the Appellants are appealing, HRS § 641-1(a) also
 
authorizes appeals from final judgments, orders or decrees in
 civil district court cases.
 
In district court cases, a judgment includes any order from
which an appeal lies. . . . A final order means an order

 
ending the proceeding, leaving nothing further to be
accomplished. . . . When a written judgment, order, or
decree ends the litigation by fully deciding all rights and
liabilities of all parties, leaving nothing further to be
adjudicated, the judgment, order, or decree is final and
appealable.
 
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai 'i 425, 426, 984 P.2d 1251, 
1252 (1999) (citations, internal quotation marks, and footnote
 
omitted; emphases added). However, the requirements for
 perfecting an aggrieved party's right to appeal in district court
 cases are slightly different from circuit court cases, because
 Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i District Court Rules of Civil Procedure 
(DCRCP) differs from HRCP Rule 58. The requirement of a separate
 judgment under HRCP Rule 58 and the holding in Jenkins is "not
 applicable to district court cases." Casumpang, 91 Hawai
'i at 
427, 984 P.2d at 1253.
 
DCRCP Rule 58 . . . , in contrast to HRCP Rule 58, does not
by its plain language require that judgment be set forth on
a separate document. Thus, the requirements set forth in
Jenkins . . . are not applicable to district court cases.
Consequently, an order that fully disposes of an action in

the district court may be final and appealable without the
entry of judgment on a separate document, as long as the
appealed order ends the litigation by fully deciding the
rights and liabilities of all parties and leaves nothing
further to be adjudicated.
 
Id. (citations, internal quotation marks and footnote omitted). 
In the instant case, it appears that the District Court
 
has not yet entered a final order or final judgment that fully

 
- 4 ­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
decides all of the rights and liabilities of all parties in Civil 
No. 1RS14-1-7371, such as the remaining substantive issue whether Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellee M Pocket Corporation (Appellee M Pocket) is entitled to an award of breach of lease money damages. We recognize that, the District Court entered an October 16, 2014 judgment for possession in Civil No. 1RS14-1­7371 that was immediately appealable pursuant to the Forgay doctrine (based on the United States Supreme Court’s holding in Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848)), which "allows an appellant to immediately appeal in a judgment for execution upon property, even if all claims of the parties have not been finally resolved." KNG Corp. v. Kim, 107 Hawai
'i 73, 77, 110 P.2d 397, 
401 (2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); Lambert v. Teisina, 131 Hawai
'i 457, 462, 319 P.3d 376, 381 
(2014). Nevertheless, the Appellants did not timely appeal from the October 16, 2015 judgment for possession, and, consequently, they "must await final resolution of all claims in the case [through the entry of the final judgment] before challenging the judgment for possession." Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai
'i 18, 21, 
889 P.2d 702, 705 (1995). The same principle applies to the District Court Orders for which the Appellants seek appellate review in the instant appeal. Once the District Court enters a final order or final judgment that adjudicates all of the remaining substantive issues in Civil No. 1RC14-1-7371, any aggrieved party will be entitled to assert a timely appeal, and,

"[a]n appeal from a final judgment brings up for review all 
interlocutory orders not appealable directly as of right which deal with issues in the case." Ueoka v Szymanski, 107 Hawai
'i 
386, 396, 114 P.3d 892, 902 (2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); State v. Adam, 97 Hawai
'i 475, 482, 40 
P.3d 877, 884 (2002) ("As a general rule, an appeal from a final judgment in a case brings up for review all preceding interlocutory orders in the case." (Citations omitted).). In other words, the Appellants are "required to await the conclusion of the case and the entry of final judgment [or an appealable final order] before filing their notice of appeal." Hawaii 
Ventures, LLC v. Otaka, Inc., 114 Hawai
'i 438, 505, 164 P.3d 696, 
763 (2007) (citation omitted). 
In addition, the October 26, 2015 order is clearly not
 
an appealable order, because HRS § 641-1(b) expressly prohibits
 appellate review of the circuit court's refusal to allow an
 interlocutory appeal from an interlocutory order:
 
(b) Upon application made within the time provided by
the rules of court, an appeal in a civil matter may be
allowed by a circuit court in its discretion from an order
denying a motion to dismiss or from any interlocutory
judgment, order, or decree whenever the circuit court may
think the same advisable for the speedy termination of
litigation before it. The refusal of the circuit court to
 
allow an appeal from an interlocutory judgment, order, or
decree shall not be reviewable by any other court.
 
(Emphasis added). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
 
case number CAAP-15-0000874 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 
jurisdiction.
