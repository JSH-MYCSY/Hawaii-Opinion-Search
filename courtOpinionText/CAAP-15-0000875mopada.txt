ZACHERY BOND, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CR. NO. 13-1-1017)
MEMORANDUM OPINION
(By: Reifurth, Presiding Judge, Ginoza and Chan, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Zachery Bond ( Bond) appeals from
the Amended Judgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence, filed
on October 12, 2015, in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
(circuit court).1  The circuit court convicted Bond of Assault in
the Second Degree, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS)
§ 707-711(1)(b) (2014)2 and sentenced him to, inter alia, four

(4) years probation with three (3) months incarceration as a
special condition.
On appeal, Bond contends that the circuit court erred
when it refused his request to instruct the jury that consent was
a defense to the offense of Assault in the Second Degree.  Bond
argues that there was sufficient evidence in the record for the
defense and the error was not harmless because, if an instruction
on consent had been given for Assault in the Second Degree, the
jury may have returned a verdict of not guilty or guilty of a
lesser charge.
For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.
I.  BACKGROUND
This case stems from an altercation between Bond and
Nathaneal Kim ( Kim) that occurred on May 25, 2013.  Bond, Kim,
Ryan Chun ( Chun), and David Reyes ( Reyes) were friends.  Teresa
Opsitnick ( Opsitnick ) had been Bond's girlfriend from 2010 until
she ended the relationship in July 2012.  At the time of the
altercation, Kim and Opsitnick were in a relationship.
On the night of May 25, 2013, Reyes invited Kim and
Opsitnick to spend the night at his house and they accepted. 
While Kim and Opsitnick were at Reyes's house, Bond, Chun and
another individual came to Reyes's house.  The group was in the
garage area and after some time Reyes apparently said to Kim and
Bond, "This is awkward. You should fight."  According to Kim,
Bond then sat in a chair a few feet from Opsitnick, with
Opsitnick between he and Bond.  Kim testified that he then raised
his eyebrows, put out his palms and shrugged his shoulders, and
that he eventually took off his jacket, at which point the other
guys went to the front lawn where Reyes had said they could
fight.  Kim testified that when he shrugged his shoulders and
raised his eyebrows, that indicated his agreement to fight Bond
because he did not want Bond to think that he was afraid. 
However, Opsitnick told Kim not to fight because it was stupid. 
Kim and Opsitnick did not go to the front, but instead stayed in
the garage.  After a short time, the others returned to the
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
garage and the physical altercation occurred between Kim and
Bond.  Kim was left with injuries requiring surgery.  Kim
testified that "[w]e were staged to go in the front [yard].
[Opsitnick] pulled me to the back, and that's where I stayed. I
walked away. I did not want to fight. I never wanted to fight." 
He testified that he did not give Bond permission to hit him.
II.  DISCUSSION
Bond contends the circuit court erred in rejecting his
request to instruct the jury that consent was a defense to
Assault in the Second Degree.  Relying on HRS § 702-233 (2014),
Bond maintains that there was sufficient evidence to establish
that Kim consented to Bond's punches and such consent negatives
the reckless state-of-mind element of Assault in the Second
Degree.
The standard of review for a trial court's issuance or
refusal of a jury instruction is whether, when read and
considered as a whole, the instructions given are
prejudicially insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent, or
misleading. Erroneous instructions are presumptively harmful
and are a ground for reversal unless it affirmatively
appears from the record as a whole that the error was not
prejudicial.  In other words, error is not to be viewed in
isolation and considered purely in the abstract.
State v. Kassebeer, 118 Hawaii 493, 504, 193 P.3d 409, 420
(2008) (internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets
omitted).  #
HRS §§ 702-233 and 702-234 (2014), located in HRS
Chapter 702 (General Principles of Penal Liability), describe
when consent is available as a defense.  HRS §§ 702-233 and 702-
234 are based on the Model Penal Code ( MPC) § 2.11.  See H.
Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 227, in 1971 House Journal, at 784; Conf.
Comm. Rep. No. 1, in 1972 House Journal, at 1035; Model Penal
Code § 2.11 (Am. Law Inst., Official Draft 1962).  
HRS § 702-233 provides:
§702-233  Consent; general.   In any prosecution, the
victim's consent to the conduct alleged, or to the result
thereof, is a defense if the consent negatives an element of
the offense or precludes the infliction of the harm or evil
sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense.
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
The commentary3 for HRS § 702-233 provides:
This section states the general view that the victim's
consent to the defendant's conduct, or to the result of the
defendant's conduct, is a defense if it negatives an element
of the offense (e.g., consent to sexual intercourse on
charge of rape) or precludes the harm or evil sought to be
prevented by the law defining the offense (e.g., consent by
the victim to allow the defendant to demonstrate a wrestling
hold or maneuver upon the victim). It is obvious that this
general principle should not be extended to all types of
evils or harms and therefore this section is intended to be
read in conjunction with §702-234 (consent to bodily injury)
and §702-235 (ineffective consent).
(Emphasis added.)
HRS § 702-234 provides: 
§702-234  Consent to bodily injury.  In any prosecution
involving conduct which causes or threatens bodily injury,
consent to such conduct or to the infliction of such injury
is a defense if:
(1) The conduct and the injury are reasonably 
foreseeable hazards of joint participation in a
lawful athletic event or competitive sport; or
(2) The consent establishes a justification for the
conduct under chapter 703.
The commentary for HRS § 702-234 states, in part, "[t]his section
specifies the types of cases in which consent to conduct which
threatens or causes physical injury will constitute a defense." 
HRS § 702-234 cmt.  In other words, HRS § 702-234 is the more
specific statute, designating the circumstances in which consent
may be a defense in a prosecution involving conduct which "causes
or threatens bodily injury[.]"  HRS § 702-234.
HRS § 702-234 provides only two circumstances where
consent is a defense for conduct that causes or threatens "bodily
injury."  First, if the "conduct and the injury are reasonably
foreseeable hazards of joint participation in a lawful athletic
event or competitive sport[.]"  HRS § 702-234(1).  The commentary
for subsection (1) states that "[w]here the conduct and injury
are the reasonably foreseeable hazards of joint participation in
a lawful athletic contest or competitive sport, the injury to one
participant, whether it be deliberate (boxing) or fortuitous
3   We may use the commentary accompanying the Hawai #i Penal Code "as an
aid in understanding the provisions of this Code[.]" HRS § 701–105 (2014).
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(basketball or football), should not import penal liability to
the other party."  HRS § 702-234 cmt.  These circumstances do not
apply to this case.  The second circumstance in which HRS § 702-
234 applies is if "[t]he consent establishes a justification for
the conduct under chapter 703."  See HRS § 702-234(2).  The
commentary for subsection (2) states:
Subsection (2) permits effective consent when it is
given in the context of a situation which would constitute a
defense of justification under chapter 703.  For example, a
parent may intrust the care of a child to another person,
thus, under some circumstances, consenting to the use of
corporal punishment, which would be sufficient to establish
justification for the use of moderate physical force. 
Again, an adult might submit to certain medical procedures
which necessarily entail severe bodily injury. 
(Footnote omitted).  Based on a plain reading of HRS § 702-234,
and considering the commentary as an aid in understanding the
statute, we conclude that consent is not a defense applicable to
Assault in the Second Degree.
Legislative history is also instructive in this
instance.  State v. Entrekin , 98 Hawai #i 221, 227, 47 P.3d 336,
342 (2002) (utilizing legislative history to confirm the plain
language interpretation of a statute).  The legislative history
for HRS §§ 702-233 and 702-234 reveals that, beyond the two
circumstances delineated in HRS § 702-234(1) and (2), the
Legislature did not intend for consent to be used as a defense to
offenses resulting in bodily injury.  HRS §§ 702-233 and 702-234
are derived from MPC § 2.11.  However, the Legislature decided to
omit language from MPC § 2.11(2)(a) -- which was originally set
out in section 234(1) of the proposed bill H.B. No. 20 -- which
would have provided for a defense where "the bodily injury
consented to or threatened by the conduct consented to is not
serious[.]"  Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 1, in 1972 House Journal, at
1035; H.B. 20, 6th Leg., Reg. Sess. (1971); H.B. 20, H.D. 1, S.D.
1, C.D. 2, 6th Leg., Reg. Sess. (1972); Model Penal Code § 2.11
(Am. Law Inst., Official Draft 1962).  With respect to deleting
this provision, the legislative history indicates:
Your Committee has agreed to amend Section 234 by
deleting Section 234(1).  The Committee finds that the law
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
should not permit the defense of consent to have such a
broad application as contemplated in this Code and that the
subsection should not permit, by consent, the type of
conduct which would result in bodily injury and disruption
of our social fabric.
Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 1, in 1972 House Journal, at 1035; see also
Supplemental Commentary on § 702-234.  The Legislature clearly
intended the defense of consent to be confined to the two
circumstances provided in HRS § 702-234(1) and (2) to the extent
conduct causes or threatens "bodily injury."
In sum, HRS §§ 702-233 and 702-234 do not allow consent
to be a defense for Assault in the Second Degree.  The circuit
court did not err in rejecting Bond's request for such a jury
instruction.
