 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Although the Villamars' Opening Brief is noncompliant
 
with Rule 28 of the Hawaii Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP),
 
we will attempt to address the gravamen of their appeal, which
 
appears to be that Plaintiff-Appellee U.S. Bank National
 Association, as Trustee under Pooling and Servicing Agreement
 Dated as of December 1, 2006 Master Asset-Backed Securities Trust
 2006-NC3 Mortgage Pass Through Certificates, Series 2006-NC3
 (U.S. Bank) did not have standing to foreclose on the subject
 
note and mortgage. This argument is without merit.
 
U.S. Bank established: (1) the existence and 
execution by the Villamars of the subject note and mortgage; (2) 
the terms of the note and mortgage; (3) default by the Villamars; and (4) notice of default. See Bank of Honolulu, N.A. v. 
Anderson, 3 Haw. App. 545, 551, 654 P.2d 1370, 1375 (1982). In addition, the undisputed evidence established that U.S. Bank had possession of the original promissory note, endorsed in blank, prior to the commencement of the foreclosure proceedings in this case. See Bank of America, N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, __ Hawai
'i __, 
__ P.3d __, No. SCWC-15-0000005, slip op. (Haw. Feb. 28, 2017). 
The Villamars' other assertions, related to loan 
securitization, assignment, the pooling and servicing agreement, are also without merit. See, e.g., U.S. Bank Nat'l Assoc. v. 
Salvacion, 134 Hawai
'i 170, 175-76, 338 P.3d 1185, 1190-91 (App. 
2014); Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Pasion, No. CAAP–12–0000657, 2015 WL 4067259, at *3 (Haw. App. June 30, 2015) (SDO), cert. denied, 2015 WL 5965835 (Haw. Oct. 13, 2015).
