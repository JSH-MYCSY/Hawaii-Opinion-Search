DISMISSING AS MOOT ALL PENDING MOTIONS IN
 
 
APPELLATE COURT CASE NUMBER CAAP-15-0000890

 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack

 
appellate jurisdiction over Non-Party/Appellant Henry Noa's
 (Appellant Henry Noa) and Defendant-Appellant Nelson Armitage's
 (Appellant Nelson Armitage) appeal from the Honorable Joseph E.
 Cardoza's November 2, 2015 judgment as to one or more but fewer
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
than all claims or parties pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Hawai 'i 
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP), because the November 2, 2015
 
 
HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified judgment does not satisfy the
 
 
requirements for an appealable final judgment under Hawaii
 
 
Revised Statutes (HRS) 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2015), HRCP Rule
 
 
54(b), HRCP Rule 58 and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte
 
 
Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai 'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 
(1994).1
 
 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals from final judgments,
 
 
orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in
 
 
the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641­
1(c). HRCP Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set
 
 
forth on a separate document." An appeal may be taken . . . only
 
 
after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment

 We note that Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellee Alexander &
Baldwin, LLC (Appellee Alexander & Baldwin) did not, in its August 4, 2014
first amended complaint name Appellant Henry Noa as a defendant in this case,and Appellant Henry Noa did not intervene as a defendant pursuant to HRCPRule 24. Furthermore, although Appellant Henry Noa does not appear to belicensed to practice law in Hawai' i, Appellant Henry Noa purports to represent
Defendant-Appellee "Kingdom of Hawai' i, also known as Reinstated Lawful
Hawaiian Government, also known as Lawful Hawaiian Government, also known asReinstated Hawaiian Government, also known as Reinstated Hawaiian Nation, alsoknown as Reinstated Hawaiian Kingdom, an unincorporated association"(hereinafter Appellee Reinstated Hawaiian Government), in this litigationmatter, despite that HRS § 605-2 (1993) and HRS § 605-14 (Supp. 2015) prohibita non-attorney from representing another person or entity in litigation beforea circuit court. Cf. Oahu Plumbing and Sheet Metal, Ltd. v. Kona
Construction, Inc., 60 Haw. 372, 377, 590 P.2d 570, 574 (1979) (Holding that"non-attorney agents are not allowed to represent corporations in litigation,for a wholly unintended exception to the rules against unauthorized practiceof law would otherwise result." (Footnote omitted)). Despite that AppellantHenry Noa is neither a named defendant nor a licensed attorney in thislitigation, the circuit court purportedly entered the November 2, 2015 HRCPRule 54(b)-certified judgment against, among other persons, Appellant HenryNoa. See Kahala Royal v. Goodsill Anderson Quinn & Stifel, 113 Hawaii 251,
277, 151 P.3d 732, 758 (2007) ("Generally, it is elementary that one is notbound by a judgment in personam resulting from litigation in which he is notdesignated as a party or to which he has not been made a party by service ofprocess.") (Citations, internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). We suggest that the parties and the circuit court address and resolve theseissues prior to and in conjunction with the amendment of the November 2, 2015HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified judgment.

has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties
 
 
pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 
P.2d at 1338. "Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order
 
 
is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the
 
 
parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." 
 
Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai 'i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 
1186 (2008); Bailey v. DuVauchelle, 135 Hawai 'i 482, 489, 353 
P.3d 1024, 1031 (2015). Furthermore,
 
 
if a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a case
involving multiple claims or multiple parties, the judgment
(a) must specifically identify the party or parties for and
against whom the judgment is entered, and (b) must (i)
identify the claims for which it is entered, and
(ii) dismiss any claims not specifically identified[.]
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (emphases added). 
For example: "Pursuant to the jury verdict entered on
(date), judgment in the amount of $___ is hereby entered in
favor of Plaintiff X and against Defendant Y upon counts I
through IV of the complaint." . . . . If the circuit court
 intends that claims other than those listed in the judgment
language should be dismissed, it must say so: for example,
"Defendant Y's counterclaim is dismissed," or "Judgment upon
Defendant Y's counterclaim is entered in favor of
 Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all other claims,
counterclaims, and cross-claims are dismissed."
 
Id. at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4 (emphasis added). 
 
When interpreting the requirements for an appealable final

 
 
judgment under HRS § 641-1(a) and HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court
 
 
of Hawai 'i has explained that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality, . . . and we should not make such searches
necessary by allowing the parties the option of waiving the
requirements of HRCP [Rule] 58.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Although the instant case involves five separate and 
distinct counts that Appellee Alexander & Baldwin asserted in its August 4, 2014 first amended complaint, the November 2, 2015 HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified judgment does not specifically identify the claim or claims upon which the circuit court intends to enter judgment. Although the November 2, 2015 HRCP Rule 54(b)­certified judgment closes with a statement that there are "no remaining claims or parties or issues[,]" the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has explained that 
[a] statement that declares "there are no other outstanding
 
claims" is not a judgment. If the circuit court intends
 
 
that claims other than those listed in the judgment language
 
should be dismissed, it must say so: for example,
 
"Defendant Y's counterclaim is dismissed," or "Judgment upon
 
Defendant Y's counterclaim is entered in favor of
 
 
Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all other claims,
 
counterclaims, and cross-claims are dismissed."
 
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4 
(emphases added). Without specifically identifying the claim or claims on which the circuit court intends to enter judgment, the November 2, 2015 HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified judgment does not satisfy the specificity requirements for an appealable final judgment in a multiple-claim case, even though the circuit court certified this judgment as to one or more but fewer than all claims or parties pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b). Absent an appealable final judgment that specifically identifies the claim or claims on which the circuit court intends to enter judgment, we lack appellate jurisdiction, and this appeal is premature. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
 
case number CAAP-15-0000890 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
