"Final Judgment," filed on November 12, 2015 (Final Judgment), 
entered by the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit (circuit court).
1 This appeal arises out of a condemnation proceeding of 
property in Kona, Hawai 'i owned by Defendant-Appellee William R. 
Santos and Edita B. Santos, Trustees for the Santos Family Trust Dated May 12, 1994 (Trustees). 
On appeal, the County contends that the circuit court 
erred when it (1) sua sponte dismissed the case pursuant to Rule 41 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) and failed to 
set aside its dismissal and (2) failed to provide an explanation as to why less severe sanctions were insufficient. 
As explained below, we conclude that the circuit court
 
abused its discretion when it sua sponte issued an order of
 dismissal without proper notice to the parties, and therefore we
 need not address the County’s other arguments on appeal.
 
On December 4, 2013, after several years of inaction,
 
the circuit court entered an “Order of Dismissal Pursuant to Rule
 41 of the Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure” (Rule 41 Dismissal
 Order), dismissing the County's complaint without prejudice for
 “want of prosecution.” Pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 § 635-3 and HRCP Rule 41(b), notice to the parties is required
 for entry of a dismissal for lack of prosecution. HRS § 635-3
 (2016) provides:
 
The court may dismiss any action for want of prosecution
after due notice to the claimants whenever claimants have
 failed to bring such action to trial within a period
established by rule of court. Prior to dismissal of any
action for want of prosecution, a court shall have adopted,
promulgated, and published a rule or rules of court
providing circumstances in which a claimant may seek relief
from the judgment or order and such other safeguards as may
be necessary.
 
HRCP 41(b)(2) states:
 
(2) For failure to prosecute or comply with these rules or
any order of the court, the court may sua sponte dismiss an
action or any claim with written notice to the parties. 
Such dismissal may be set aside and the action or claim
reinstated by order of the court for good cause shown upon
motion duly filed not later than 10 days from the date of
the order of dismissal.
 
The Honorable Melvin H. Fujino presiding.

Additionally, "circuit courts have inherent power to dismiss a
 
case for want of prosecution but only where the parties have an
 opportunity to be heard prior to the dismissal." Lim v. Harvis
 Constr., Inc., 65 Haw. 71, 73 647 P.2d 290, 292 n.1 (1982).
 
In this case, neither party was served with a copy of
 
the Rule 41 Dismissal Order when it was issued by the circuit
 court, as required by HRCP Rule 77(d). The County stated that it
 had only became aware of the Rule 41 Dismissal Order while
 reviewing the status of various cases long after the entry of the
 order.
 
Pursuant to HRCP Rule 41(b)(2), the Rule 41 Dismissal
 
Order included a provision that allowed the parties to show good
 cause for setting aside the dismissal within ten days from the
 filing of the order. However, neither the County nor the
 Trustees were given an opportunity to respond to the order
 because neither party was given notice prior to or after the
 filing of the order as required by HRS § 635-3 and HRCP Rule
 41(b)(2). Therefore, we conclude that the circuit court abused
 its discretion when it failed to notify the parties of its Rule
 41 Dismissal Order.
 
We note that although the Rule 41 Dismissal Order
 
purports to dismiss the action "without prejudice," the Final
 Judgment entered by the circuit court dismisses the action "with
 prejudice" and enters judgment on the complaint in favor of the
 Trustees and on the counterclaim in favor of the County. The
 circuit court also denied the County's motion to set aside the
 Rule 41 Dismissal Order and the County's motion for
 reconsideration without explaining the basis for its decisions. 
Therefore, we cannot tell if the circuit court's basis for
 denying these motions was simply the failure of the County to
 file a motion to set aside the dismissal within ten days. On
 remand, we direct the circuit court to address the merits of the
 County's arguments that it has shown good cause for setting aside
 the Rule 41 Dismissal Order.
 
Accordingly, we vacate the Order Denying Motion to Set
 
Aside, the Order Denying Motion for Reconsideration, and the

Final Judgment. This case is remanded to the circuit court for 
further proceedings in accordance herewith.
