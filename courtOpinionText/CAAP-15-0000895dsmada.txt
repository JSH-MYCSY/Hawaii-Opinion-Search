APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 15-1-0475(1))

 
ORDER DISMISSING THE APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
jurisdiction over this appeal by Plaintiffs-Appellants Michael 
Anthony Kimo Harlacher and Roni Lee Du Preez (Appellants), pro 
se, because the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit has not yet 
reduced its dispositive rulings on substantive claims to a separate judgment that resolves all claims against all parties in the case pursuant to Rule 58 of Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP) and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & 
Wright, 76 Hawai 'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Under Hawai 'i law, "[a]ppeals shall be allowed in civil 
matters from all final judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit 
. . . courts[.]" HRS § 641-1(a) (Supp. 2015). Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c) (Supp. 2015). HRCP Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." "An appeal may be taken from circuit court orders resolving claims against parties only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
"Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. 
One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai
'i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008); 
Bailey v. DuVauchelle, 135 Hawai 'i 482, 489, 353 P.3d 1024, 1031 
(2015). Furthermore, "an appeal from any judgment will be dismissed as premature if the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 119, 869 at 1338. When interpreting the 
requirements for a judgment under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i noted: 
If we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face all
 
of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the often
voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions of
jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the parties
nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the burden
of searching a voluminous record for evidence of finality, .
. . and we should not make such searches necessary by
allowing the parties the option of waiving the requirements
of HRCP [Rule] 58.

Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. "An appeal from an 
order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor of or against the 
party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Id. at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote omitted). 
The record on appeal in appellate court case number
 
CAAP-15-0000895 contains no final judgment. Therefore, this court
 lacks jurisdiction over the appeal.
 
Although the January 6, 2016 "Order Granting
 
Defendants[-Appellees] Andrew Launtenbach and Starn O'Toole Marcus
 & Fisher's Motion to Dismiss the Complaint Filed September 3, 2015
 and Awarding Attorney's Fees," and "Order Granting Defendant[-
Appellee] Michael Smythe's Motion to Dismiss the Complaint Filed
 
1
September 3, 2015,"  resolve all substantive claims by dismissing
all counts in the Complaint, the orders have not been reduced to a separate judgment, as required by 
Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58. See 
Carlisle, 119 Hawai 'i at 254, 195 P.3d at 1186 ("an order is not 
appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment."). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellate No. CAAP­
15-0000895 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
