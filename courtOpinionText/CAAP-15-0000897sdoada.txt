APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

Defendant-Appellant Kramer Jay Sueki Aoki (Aoki) 
appeals from the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order 
Denying Defendant Kramer Jay Sueki Aoki's Motion to Dismiss with Prejudice (Order) entered by the Circuit Court of the First 
Circuit (Circuit Court)
1 on October 22, 2015. Upon careful 
review of the record and the briefs submitted by the parties and 
having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised, as well as the relevant statutory and case law, we affirm the Circuit Court's Order. 
I. 
On November 6, 2014, Aoki was indicted by the grand 
jury for sexual assault in the third degree in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707-732(1)(e)(v) (2014).
2 The

2 The statute provides, in relevant part: 
(1) A person commits the offense of sexual assault in the
third degree if: 
. . . . 
(continued...) NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
case was docketed as Criminal No. 14-1-1762 (the First Case). 
The indictment defined the term "custody" to mean "restraint by a 
public servant pursuant to arrest, detention or order of a court" pursuant to "Section 710-1000(3) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes." 
The indictment in the First Case was based upon 
evidence presented to the grand jury that on September 6, 2014, the female complaining witness (CW) was driving when she was 
pulled over by a male Honolulu police officer in a marked police 
vehicle. She gave the officer her driver's license, vehicle registration and insurance card. The officer told her she was speeding. The officer returned to his vehicle with CW's documentation. CW walked to the officer's vehicle. She began to cry and asked the officer not to write a ticket. The officer reached out and held her hands. He put his hand on her chin. His hand went down to her chest, slipped into her shirt and under her bra. CW did not give the officer permission to touch her breast. CW pulled away. The officer asked CW if he could touch her breast again. CW said, "no." The officer returned CW's documentation. He did not issue a ticket. 
The grand jury also heard testimony from a Honolulu 
police detective assigned to the Professional Standards Office, Criminal Investigation Section. The detective had interviewed CW and developed a photographic lineup based upon the information she provided. CW identified Aoki as the police officer who touched her breast. The detective determined that Aoki was employed and on duty as a Honolulu police officer at the time of the alleged incident. The detective interviewed Aoki. Aoki admitted conducting a traffic stop of CW. He said he did not issue a citation. He denied that his hand touched CW's breast. 
The grand jury had been instructed: "Pursuant to [HRS] 
Section 710-1000(3)," "custody" as used in HRS § 707-732(1)(e)(v) 
2 (...continued)
(e) The person, while employed: 
. . . . 
(v) As a law enforcement officer as defined in 
section 710-1000, knowingly subjects to sexual
contact . . . a person in custody, or causes theperson to have sexual contact with the actor[.] 
2  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"means restrained by a public servant pursuant to arrest, 
detention, or order of the court." On January 6, 2015, Aoki filed a motion to dismiss the First Case with prejudice. He argued that the grand jury was incorrectly instructed on the meaning of the term "custody" because the definition in HRS § 710-1000 pertained to escape offenses and, under the applicable case law, a person detained in a traffic stop which never reaches the "point of arrest" is not in "custody" within the meaning of HRS § 707-732(1)(e)(v). Aoki asked that the First Case be dismissed with prejudice because of "the State's failure to adduce probable cause before the grand jury." On February 12, 2015, the Circuit Court
3 entered an Order Dismissing Case With 
Prejudice. 
On June 29, 2015 the Complaint at issue below (the
Second Case) was filed charging Aoki with Sexual Assault in the 
Fourth Degree in violation of HRS § 707-733(1)(a) (2014).4 Aoki 
filed his Motion to Dismiss with Prejudice (MTD) on July 22, 
2015. The State's opposition was filed on August 24, 2015. The 
State's memorandum included a copy of the transcript of proceedings on Aoki's motion to dismiss the First Case. On October 22, 2015, the Circuit Court entered the Order, which denied Aoki's MTD. This appeal followed. 
II. 
Aoki contends that the Circuit Court erred by:A. ruling (in Conclusions of Law 15 and 20) that the 
Second Case was not barred by double jeopardy; and
B. ruling (in Conclusions of Law 16, 17, 18, 19, and 
20) that the Second Case was not barred by HRS §§ 701-111(1)(b) 
3 The Honorable Glenn J. Kim presided over the First Case. 
4 At the time of the alleged offense, HRS § 707-733 provided: 
(1) A person commits the offense of sexual assault in the
fourth degree if: 
(a) The person knowingly subjects another
person to sexual contact by compulsion orcauses another person to have sexualcontact with the actor by compulsion[.]

(2014)5 and 701-109(2) (2014).6 
A trial court's label of a finding of fact or 
conclusion of law is not determinative of the standard of review. 
Crosby v. State Dep't of Budget & Fin., 76 Hawai# i 332, 340, 876 
P.2d 1300, 1308 (1994). Conclusions of law are ordinarily reviewed under the "right/wrong" standard. Estate of Klink ex rel. Klink v. State, 113 Hawai# i 332, 351, 152 P.3d 504, 523 
(2007). A conclusion of law that is supported by the trial court's findings of fact and reflects an application of the correct rule of law will not be overturned. Id. However, when a conclusion of law presents mixed questions of fact and law, we review it under the "clearly erroneous" standard because the court's conclusions are dependent on the facts and circumstances of each individual case. Id. "A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when, despite evidence to support the finding, the appellate court is left with the definite and firm conviction in reviewing all of the evidence that a mistake has been committed." Birano v. State, 143 Hawai# i 163, 181, 426 P.3d 387, 405 (2018) 
(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). A finding of fact is also clearly erroneous when the record lacks substantial

Although a prosecution is for a violation of a different
statutory provision or is based on different facts, it isbarred by a former prosecution under any of the followingcircumstances: 
(1) The former prosecution resulted in an acquittalwhich has not subsequently been set aside or ina conviction as defined in section 701-110(3)and the subsequent prosecution is for: 
. . . . 
(b) Any offense for which the defendant shouldhave been tried on the first prosecutionunder section 701-109 unless the court ordered a separate trial of the offense[.] 
6 HRS § 701-109(2) provides: 
Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section
[pertaining to the court granting a motion for separatetrials], a defendant shall not be subject to separate trialsfor multiple offenses based on the same conduct or arisingfrom the same episode, if such offenses are known to theappropriate prosecuting officer at the time of thecommencement of the first trial and are within the jurisdiction of a single court.

evidence to support the finding. Id. "Substantial evidence" is 
"credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion." In re Grievance Arbitration Between State of Hawai# i Org. of Police Officers, 135 Hawai# i 456, 461-62, 353 P.3d

A. 
Aoki challenges the following conclusions of law by the 
Circuit Court: 
15. In his June [sic] 22, 2015 Motion to Dismiss,
Defendant's constitutional claim is that the sexual assault in the fourth degree charge brought againsthim in the underlying case is barred by the doublejeopardy clause, as Judge Kim's dismissal of thesexual assault in the third degree charge previouslyfiled against him in [the First Case], constituted anacquittal of the charge. For the following reasons,the court concludes that jeopardy did not attach as aresult of Judge Kim's order, and therefore the doublejeopardy clause does not preclude the State fromprosecuting the present sexual assault in the fourthdegree charge against Defendant: 
a. Defendant's January 6, 2015 Motion toDismiss was granted on a pre-trial basisby Judge Kim, and was not heard by thetrier of fact. 
b. Judge Kim's ruling, which was based uponhis evaluation of the legal definition of"custody", was on legal, not factualgrounds. 
c. No witnesses were called at the January 28, 2015 hearing, and no testimonywas provided. Further, Judge Kimspecifically stated that the hearing wasnot evidentiary in nature, and he did notissue any findings of fact either at thehearing or in the Order GrantingDefendant's Motion to Dismiss With Prejudice filed on February 12, 2015. 
d. Judge Kim recognized that his decisioncould be appealed or that a sexual assaultin the fourth degree charge could bebrought against Defendant, both of whichare characteristics of a dismissal rather than an acquittal. 
e. In light of the circumstances of thehearing, the intent of Judge Kim's rulingwas not an acquittal, but rather adismissal of the charge. 
f. Defendant's January 6, 2015 Motion toDismiss was brought pursuant to Rule 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
12(b)(2) of the Hawaii Rules of Penal
Procedure, requiring "defenses andobjections based on defects in the charge(other than that it fails to showjurisdiction in the court or to charge anoffense which objections shall be noticedby the court at any time during thependency of the proceedings)" to be raisedprior to trial, and Defendant thereforewas not "subjected to the hazards of trialand possible conviction." [See] Serfass v.United States, 420 U.S. 377, 391, 95 S.Ct. 1055, 1064, 43 L. Ed. 2d 265, 276(1975). 
g. As Defendant was not facing a risk of hisdetermination of guilt on January 28,2015, when his January 6, 2015 Motion toDismiss was heard by Judge Kim, jeopardydid not attach. 
h. Without attachment, there was nopossibility of Defendant's conviction, andtherefore the double jeopardy clause isinapplicable in the context of this case.[See] State v. Rodrigues, 67 Haw. 70,79-80, 679 P.2d 615, 622 (1984). 
i. As Defendant "deliberately [sought]termination of his . . . proceedings on abasis unrelated to factual guilt orinnocence, double jeopardy principles donot bar retrial." State v. Ake, 88 Haw.[sic] 389, 393, 967 P.2d 221, 225 (1998)(citations omitted). 
j. Judge Kim's ruling was a dismissal, bothin form and substance, rather than anacquittal of the sexual assault in thethird degree charge. 
. . . . 
20. In light of the above, and based upon applicable
statutory and legal authority, the court properlydenies Defendant's July 22,2015 Motion to Dismiss onboth the constitutional and statutory claims raised byDefendant. 
Conclusions of law nos. 15 and 20 are actually combined findings 
of fact and conclusions of law. They are not clearly erroneous because they are supported by substantial evidence in the record, and the Circuit Court applied the correct rules of law to the facts. 
The double jeopardy clause of the United States 
Constitution applies to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784, 793-96 (1969), and the Hawai# i constitutional provision prohibiting double jeopardy 
is cast in substantially similar terms. State v. Martin, 62 Haw. 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
364, 373, 616 P.2d 193, 199 (1980). The policy behind the double 
jeopardy clause was described by the United States Supreme Court in Green v. United States, 355 U.S. 184, 187-88 (1957): 
The underlying idea, one that is deeply ingrained in at
least the Anglo-American system of jurisprudence, is thatthe State with all its resources and power should not beallowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individualfor an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him toembarrassment, expense, and ordeal, and compelling him [orher] to live in a continuing state of anxiety andinsecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that eventhough innocent he [or she] may be found guilty. 
The Hawai# i Supreme Court adopted this policy in State v. 
Bannister, 60 Haw. 658, 660-61, 594 P.2d 133, 135 (1979). 
The Hawai# i Supreme Court has held that "[d]ouble 
jeopardy does not attach unless there is a risk of a 
determination of guilt." State v. Rodrigues, 67 Haw. 70, 79, 679 P.2d 615, 622, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1078 (1984) (citing Serfass v. United States, 420 U.S. 377 (197[5])). 
[I]n a jury trial jeopardy attaches once the jury is
empaneled and sworn, Downum v. United States, 372 U.S. 734,83 S. Ct. 1033, 10 L. Ed. 2d 100 (1963), and this rule hasspecifically been made applicable to the states. Crist v. Bretz, [437 U.S. 28, 37-38, 98 S.Ct. 2156, 2161-62, 57L.Ed.2d 24 (1978)]. 
State v. Moriwake, 65 Haw. 47, 51, 647 P.2d 705, 709 (1982). In 
a nonjury trial, jeopardy attaches when the court begins to hear evidence. State v. Poohina, 97 Hawai# i 505, 510, 40 P.3d 907, 
912 (2002) (citation omitted). 
Here, Aoki's motion to dismiss the First Case was a 
pretrial motion made pursuant to Hawai
#i Rules of Penal Procedure 
(HRPP) Rule 12(b)(2).7 It was based on a defect in the charge to 
the grand jury. Aoki was not at "risk of a determination of 
7 HRPP Rule 12 provides, in relevant part: 
(b) Pretrial Motions. Any defense, objection, or request
which is capable of determination without the trial of the
general issue may be raised before trial by motion. Motions may be written or oral at the discretion of the judge. The following must be raised prior to trial: 
. . . . 
(2) defenses and objections based on defects in the
charge[.]

guilt," Rodrigues, supra, because he could not have been adjudged 
guilty even if the Circuit Court had denied the motion to dismiss. Jeopardy had not attached in the First Case. 
B. 
Aoki also challenges the following conclusions of law 
by the Circuit Court: 
16. In his June [sic] 22, 2015 Motion to Dismiss,
Defendant's statutory claim is that the sexual assaultin the fourth degree charge brought against him in theunderlying case is barred under HRS Section 701-111(1)(b), as Judge Kim's dismissal of the sexual assaultin the third degree charge previously filed againsthim in Criminal No. 14-1-1762 constituted an acquittalof the charge. For the following reasons, the courtconcludes that Judge Kim's ruling did not constitutean acquittal of the charge, and therefore the State isnot precluded from prosecuting the present sexualassault in the fourth degree charge against Defendantunder HRS Section 701-111(1)(b): 
a. The provisions of HRS Section 701-111(1)(b) would prohibit the underlyingprosecution against Defendant only if twocriteria are met: (1) there had been anacquittal of the sexual assault in thethird degree charge previously broughtagainst him, and (2) the sexual assault inthe fourth degree offense is one for whichDefendant should have been tried in [theFirst Case], under the provisions of HRSSection 701-109. 
b. The court, in considering the definitionof the term "acquittal" as discussed abovein the context of the double jeopardyclause and under HRS Section 701-110(1),finds and concludes that Judge Kim'sruling was a legal determination of the"defenses and objections based on defectsin the charge" raised by Defendant underRule 12(b)(2) of the Hawaii Rules of PenalProcedure, rather than "a determination bythe court that there was insufficient evidence to warrant a conviction". 
c. In light of Judge Kim's ruling onDefendant's January 6, 2015 Motion toDismiss, where he agreed with defensecounsel that the State had not presentedthe grand jury with "adequate factualallegations to support a finding ofprobable cause" as to "custody", Defendantwas not acquitted of the sexual assault inthe third degree charge brought againsthim in [the First Case], and therefore thefirst criterion under Section 701-111(1)(b) is not satisfied. See also Rule 29(a) of the [Hawai #i] Rules of Penal
Procedure pertaining to a motion forjudgment of acquittal before submission to 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the jury. 
d. As Defendant was not acquitted of the
prior sexual assault in the third degreecharge, the second criterion under Section701-111(1)(b) need not be addressed by thecourt. 
17. Based upon the court's determination that Defendant
was not acquitted, i.e., found to be not guilty, ofthe prior sexual assault in the third degree charge byJudge Kim, the court is unable to sustain Defendant'sstatutory claim under HRS Section 701-111(1)(b). 
18. 
Defendant's compulsory joinder argument under HRSSection 701-109(2) also is not sustainable as: 
a. The State is permitted, "at least by 'thetime of the commencement of the first trial'", to charge "multiple offensesbased on the same conduct or arising fromthe same episode, if such offenses areknown to the appropriate prosecutingofficer at the time of the commencement of the first trial and are within the jurisdiction of a single court." [See]State v. Akau, 118 Hawai #i 44, 58 n.14,
185 P.3d 229, 243 [n.14] (2008); HRSSection 701-109(2). 
b. Trial in the prior case had not commenced. 
19. Based upon the court's determination that Defendant
was not acquitted, i.e., found to be not guilty, ofthe prior sexual assault in the third degree charge byJudge Kim, the court is unable to sustain Defendant'sstatutory claim under HRS Section 701-111(1)(b). 
20. 
In light of the above, and based upon applicablestatutory and legal authority, the court properlydenies Defendant's July 22,2015 Motion to Dismiss onboth the constitutional and statutory claims raised byDefendant. 
To prevail on his HRS § 701-111(1)(b) argument, Aoki 
had to show that he had been acquitted of the charge in the First 
Case. The Hawai# i Supreme Court has adopted the following test 
for what constitutes an acquittal: "[A] defendant is acquitted only when the ruling of the judge, whatever its label, actually represents a resolution in the defendant's favor, correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged." Poohina, 97 Hawai# i at 509, 40 P.3d at 911 (citation and internal 
quotation marks omitted). In other words, for a judge's decision to constitute an acquittal, it must be based on findings related to the factual guilt of the defendant. See State v. Markowski, 88 Hawai# i 477, 484, 967 P.2d 674, 681 (App. 1998). "[W]hat 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
constitutes an acquittal is more dependent upon the intent of the 
ruling rather than the label." Poohina, 97 Hawai# i at 509, 40 
P.3d at 911. Conclusions of law nos. 15 through 20 are combined findings of fact and conclusions of law. They are not clearly erroneous because they are supported by substantial evidence in the record (including the transcript of the hearing on Aoki's motion to dismiss the First Case), and the Circuit Court applied the correct rules of law to the facts. 
III. 
For the foregoing reasons, the Circuit Court's Findings 
of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Denying Defendant Kramer Jay Sueki Aoki's Motion to Dismiss with Prejudice entered on October 22, 2015 is affirmed.
