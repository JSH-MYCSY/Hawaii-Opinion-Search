STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Petitioner-Appellee, v.
WINDYCESLAU D. LORENZO, aka KAMEHAMEHA VI, Respondent-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.
 NO. 15-1-0238)
 
ORDER
 
DISMISSING APPELLATE COURT CASE NUMBER
 
CAAP-15-0000899 FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
AND
 
DISMISSING ALL PENDING MOTIONS AS MOOT
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Upon review of the record on appeal, it appears that we
 
lack appellate jurisdiction over Respondent-Appellant Windyceslau
 
D. Lorenzo, aka Kamehameha VI's (Appellant Lorenzo) appeal from
 the Honorable Virginia Lea Crandall's October 22, 2015 order
 granting Petitioner-Appellee State of Hawaii's (the State)
 petition for an order expunging certain recorded instruments in
 S.P. No. 15-1-0238 VLC, because the circuit court has not yet
 reduced the October 22, 2015 interlocutory order to a separate
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
judgment pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) 
(1993 & Supp. 2015), Rule 58 of the Hawai 'i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 
(1994). 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals to the Hawai 'i 
Intermediate Court of Appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees in circuit court civil cases. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). HRCP Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." "An appeal may be taken from circuit court orders resolving claims against parties only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 
Hawai
'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. "Thus, based on Jenkins and 
HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai
'i 245, 
254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008); Bailey v. DuVauchelle, 135 Hawai
'i 482, 489, 353 P.3d 1024, 1031 (2015). Therefore, 
although the October 22, 2015 order appears to resolve all claims against all parties, it will not be eligible for appellate review until the circuit court reduces it to a separate judgment in favor of and against the appropriate parties as to all claims. 
When interpreting the requirements for an appealable 
final judgment under HRS § 641-1(a) and HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has explained that 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality, . . . and we should not make such searches
necessary by allowing the parties the option of waiving the
requirements of HRCP [Rule] 58. 
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (citation omitted; 
original emphasis). Consequently, "an order disposing of a 
circuit court case is appealable when the order is reduced to a separate judgment." Alford v. City and Count of Honolulu, 109 
Hawai
'i 14, 20, 122 P.3d 809, 815 (2005) (citation omitted). "An 
appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 120, 
869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote omitted). 
On December 17, 2015, the circuit court clerk filed the 
record on appeal in CAAP-15-0000899, which does not contain a final judgment on all of the claims. Although exceptions to the final judgment requirement exist under the doctrine in Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848) (the Forgay doctrine), the collateral order doctrine, and HRS § 641-1(b) (1993 & Supp. 2015), the October 22, 2015 order does not satisfy the requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine, the collateral order doctrine, or HRS § 641-1(b). See Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai
'i 
18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) (regarding the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai
'i 319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 
(1998) (regarding the three requirements for the collateral order 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
doctrine); HRS § 641-1(b) (regarding the requirements for an
 
appeal from an interlocutory order). Absent an appealable final
 judgment on all of the parties' claims in this case, we lack
 appellate jurisdiction, and Appellant Lorenzo's appeal is
 premature. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
 
case number CAAP-15-0000899 is dismissed.
 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions
 
herein are dismissed as moot.
