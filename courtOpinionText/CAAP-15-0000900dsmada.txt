stipulate to dismiss the appeal with prejudice, with each party
 
to bear their own attorneys' fees and costs; (2) the undated
 stipulation is signed by counsel for all parties appearing in the
 appeal; (3) HRAP Rule 42(a) authorizes dismissal of an appeal
 that has not been docketed, whereas HRAP Rule 42(b) authorizes
 dismissal of a docketed appeal; and (4) here, dismissal is
 authorized by HRAP Rule 42(a) because the appeal has not been
 docketed.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the stipulation is
 
approved in part and the appeal is dismissed with prejudice. The
 parties shall bear their own attorneys' fees and costs.
