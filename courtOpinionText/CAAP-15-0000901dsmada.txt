Upon review of the record in No. CAAP-15-000901 and the 
Hawai'i State Judiciary Ho 'ohiki for the underlying case, Civil 
No. 13-1-343, it appears that: 
(1) On November 23, 2015, Defendants-Appellants
 
Georgette Kaulia and Bert Chan Kahumoku (Appellants), pro se,
 
filed a notice of appeal;
 
(2) That same day, Appellant Georgette Kaulia filed a
 
motion for leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis;
 
(3) On December 22, 2015, the court denied the motion 
without prejudice to a subsequent motion containing the information requested in Form 4 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP);  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(4) Thereafter, neither appellant filed a motion for
 
leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis here or in the
 
underlying circuit court case, Civil No. 13-1-343;
 
(5) On February 8, 2015, the appellate clerk notified
 
Appellants that the time to docket the record on appeal expired
 on January 22, 2016, the filing and docketing fees had not been
 paid, the record on appeal cannot be prepared without the fees or
 an order authorizing Appellants to proceed on appeal in forma
 pauperis, the matter would be called to the court's attention on
 February 18, 2016, for appropriate action, which may include
 dismissal, and Appellants may file a motion requesting relief
 from default;
 
(6) Appellants did not pay the filing and docketing
 
fees, or take any further action in this appeal; and
 
(7) An appeal may be dismissed where the record on
 
appeal has not been prepared because the appellant failed to pay 
the required fees or obtain an order allowing the appellant to
 proceed in forma pauperis. HRAP Rule 11(b)(2) & (c)(2).
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed. 
Dated: Honolulu, Hawai
'i, February 24, 2016.
