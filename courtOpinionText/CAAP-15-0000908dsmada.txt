Appellant that the time to docket the record on appeal expired on
 January 25, 2016, the filing and docketing fees had not been
 paid, the record on appeal cannot be prepared without the fees or
 an order authorizing Appellant to proceed on appeal in forma

fees, or take any further action in this appeal; and
 
(5) An appeal may be dismissed where the record on

the required fees or obtain an order allowing the appellant to proceed in forma pauperis. Hawai
