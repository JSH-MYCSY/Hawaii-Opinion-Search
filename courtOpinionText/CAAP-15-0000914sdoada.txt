LOUIS L. PALAMA, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 5DTC-15-000300)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER

 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Louis L. Palama, aka Louis Palama
and Louis L.K. Palama (Palama) appeals from the "Judgment and
 
Notice of Entry of Judgment," filed on November 12, 2015 in the
1
District Court of the Fifth Circuit  (district court).
 

 

 
Palama was convicted of driving without a valid driver
 
license, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statute (HRS) § 286-102
 
2
(2007 Repl.)  as a misdemeanor and no motor vehicle insurance, in

 The Honorable Joe P. Moss presided.

 HRS § 286-102(a) provides:
 
§286-102 Licensing.  (a) [Subsection effective
until December 31, 2015. For subsection effective January
1, 2016, see Supp. 2015] No person, except one exempted
under section 286-105, one who holds an instruction permit
under section 286-110, one who holds a provisional license
under section 286-102.6, one who holds a commercial driver's
license issued under section 286-239, or one who holds a
commercial driver's license instruction permit issued under
section 286-236, shall operate any category of motor
vehicles listed in this section without first being
appropriately examined and duly licensed as a qualified
driver of that category of motor vehicles.

violation of HRS § 431:10C-104(a) (2005 Repl.).3
 
On appeal, Palama contends the district court erred by
 
(1) denying his Motion to Dismiss for Lack of
 
Jurisdiction,
 
(2) denying his oral Motion to Dismiss because Count I
 
of the Amended Complaint failed to state an offense and the term
 "operate" failed to give him adequate notice of the nature of the
 charge, and
 
(3) finding there was sufficient evidence to convict
 
him of both charges.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Palama's points of error as follows:
 
(1) Palama's claim that the district court lacked 
jurisdiction is without merit. State v. Kaulia, 128 Hawai
'i 479, 
486-87, 291 P.3d 377, 384-85 (2013). 
(2) Palama's claim that the charge of no driver's
 
license, in violation of HRS § 286-102, failed to state an
 essential element of the charge, i.e. driving on a public road,
 way, street, or highway, is without merit. The plain language of
 HRS § 286-102(a) does not limit driving without a license to

 HRS § 431:10C-104 provides:
 
§431:10C-104 Conditions of operation and registration
of motor vehicles.  (a) Except as provided in section
431:10C-105, no person shall operate or use a motor vehicle
upon any public street, road, or highway of this State at
any time unless such motor vehicle is insured at all times
under a motor vehicle insurance policy.
 
(b) Every owner of a motor vehicle used or operated

at any time upon any public street, road, or highway of this
State shall obtain a motor vehicle insurance policy upon
such vehicle which provides the coverage required by this
article and shall maintain the motor vehicle insurance
 policy at all times for the entire motor vehicle
registration period.
 
(c) Any person who violates the provisions of this
section shall be subject to the provisions of section
431:10C-117(a).
 
(d) The provisions of this article shall not apply to
any vehicle owned by or registered in the name of any agency
of the federal government, or to any antique motor vehicle
as defined in section 249-1.

public roads. State v. Kelekolio , 94 Hawai 'i 354, 356-61, 14 
P.3d 364, 366-71 (App. 2000) Therefore, the charge did not omit
 
an essential element of the offense by failing to specify that
 the offense occurred on a public street, way, road, or highway.
 
(3) Palama contends there was insufficient evidence to
 
convict him of violating HRS § 286-102 and HRS § 431:10C-104. 
Palama claims the State failed to prove that he had two or more
 prior convictions for violating HRS § 286-102 within the five-
year period preceding the instant offense, failed to prove he hadone prior offense for violating HRS § 431:10C-104 within five
 years prior to the instant offense, and failed to prove that
 Palama was exempt from licensure under HRS § 286-105 (2007
 Repl.).

 HRS § 286-105 states:
 
§286-105 What persons are exempt from license. The
 
following persons are exempt from license:
 (1) 	 Any person while driving or operating a motor
vehicle in the service or employ of any branch
or agency of the federal government; provided
that the person has received a license or permit
from the branch or agency to operate and drive
the motor vehicle; provided further that the
branch or agency has been duly authorized by the
federal government to issue the license or
permit;
 (2) 	 Any person while driving or operating any road
machine, farm tractor, or implement of husbandry
temporarily operated or moved on a highway;
provided that no person under the age of
thirteen years shall be permitted to drive or
operate any such road machine, farm tractor, or
implement of husbandry on a highway;
 (3) 	 Any person who is at least eighteen years of age
and who has in the person's possession a valid
driver's license to drive the categories of
motor vehicles listed in section 286-102(b),
except section 286-102(b)(4), that is equivalent
to a driver's license issued in this State but
 was issued to the person in another state of the
United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,
United States Virgin Islands, American Samoa,
Guam, a province of the Dominion of Canada, or
the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands
 for that category of motor vehicle which the
person is operating;
 (4) 	 Any person who has in the person's possession a
valid commercial motor vehicle driver's license
 issued by any state of the United States,
Mexico, or a province of the Dominion of Canada

At the close of trial, the district court stated that
 
the record did not reflect that Exhibit P-2 was admitted and the
 
following exchange occurred:
 
[Deputy Prosecuting
Attorney (DPA):] Oh, (inaudible). I have itmoved in and I did ask - -
The Court: You do? 
[DPA]: Yes, it is. 
The Court: 
Okay. 
Then I forgot to check
it. Okay. Thank you. Okay.
So we have P-1 through P-6
admitted.  Anything else? Any
other witnesses? (emphasisadded) 
[DPA]: No, Your Honor. 
The district court admitted Exhibit P-2 into evidence
 
without objection by Palama. Therefore, any error in admitting
 
Exhibit P-2 is waived. Exhibit P-2 is a certified copy of a
 "Judgment/Order and Notice of Entry of Judgment/Order," filed on
 May 8, 2014 in case No. 5DTC-13-002228, which showed a person
 named Louis L. Palama was convicted of violating HRS § 286-102
 and HRS § 431:10C-104. Exhibit P-4, which Palama does not
 challenge, contains a copy of the citation for 5DTC-13-002228,
 which showed a person named Louis Palama was cited for violating
 HRS § 286-102 and HRS § 431:10C-104. The citation also contained
 a date of birth and last four digits of a social security number.
 Palama's citation in this case contained the same date of birth
 and last four digits of a social security number as the ones in
 5DTC-13-002228. There was evidence that Palama was cited and
 convicted in violation of HRS § 286-102 and HRS § 431:10C-104 on
 
4(...continued)
 
that issues licenses in accordance with the
 
minimum federal standards for the issuance of
 commercial motor vehicle driver's licenses; and
 (5) 	 Any person who drives or operates state or
county motor vehicles while employed by, in the
service of, or volunteering for the state or
county fire departments, provided that they are
trained and certified to drive category (4)
motor vehicles as set forth in section
 286-102(b)(4) by the state or county government,
as appropriate, and provided that the person
maintains a category (3) license as set forth in
section 286-102(b)(3).

Exhibit P-5, a certified copy of a "Judgment of
 
Conviction and Probation Sentence" in Cr. No. 10-1-0283,
 
originally filed on January 19, 2012, shows that a person named
 Louis Palama was convicted of driving without a license. Palama
 stipulated that Exhibit P-6 is a video that shows him being
 sentenced in Cr. No. 10-1-0283. Palama's conviction in Cr. No.
 10-1-0283 was affirmed by this court in appeal No. CAAP-12­0000049 on June 5, 2013. This evidence supports a finding that
 Palama had a conviction for driving without a license on January
 19, 2012. 
Palama's convictions on January 19, 2012 and May 8, 
2014 constitutes two prior convictions for the same offense in the preceding five year period to the instant offense, within the meaning of HRS § 286-136(b) (2005 Repl.). State v. Vierra, 118 
Hawai
'i 259, 267, 188 P.3d 773, 781 (App. 2008). Therefore, 
Palama was subject to sentencing to a "minimum fine of $500 and a maximum fine of $1,000, or imprisoned not more than one year, or both," pursuant to HRS § 286-136(b), which constitutes a misdemeanor. HRS § 706-663 (2014 Repl.). 
Palama's conviction on May 8, 2014 for violating HRS
 
§ 431:10C-104 constituted a prior conviction for the same offense
 in the preceding five year period to the instant offense, within
 the meaning of HRS § 431:10C-117(a)(2)(B), (a)(3)(A)(ii), and
 (a)(5).
 
Contrary to Palama's claim, Plaintiff-Appellee State of 
Hawai
'i (State) disproved that Palama was exempt from licensure 
under HRS § 286-105. Palama was observed driving a Ford pick up truck by a Honolulu Police Department (HPD) officer. Thus, the 
State disproved that HRS § 286-105(2), "driving or operating any 
road machine, farm tractor, or implement of husbandry temporarily operated or moved on a highway," applied to Palama. Michael Drake, a supervising driver's license examiner for the County of Kaua
'i, testified that he maintains the records for Hawai 'i 
driver's licensing in the County of Kaua 'i and that the records 
showed that Palama's license was cancelled and that Palama did not have a license on March 13, 2015, the date the citation was

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
issued. Palama told the HPD officer that he had a Kingdom of 
Atooi license, that he did not have a State of Hawai 'i license, 
and could not provide a license from the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or anywhere else. See HRS § 286-105(3). Therefore, the 
State disproved that HRS § 286-105(1), (3), (4), and (5) applied to Palama.
 Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Judgment and Notice of
 
Entry of Judgment," filed on November 12, 2015 in the District
 Court of the Fifth Circuit is affirmed.
