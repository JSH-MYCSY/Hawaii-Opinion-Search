NO. CAAP-15-0000915 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, by its Office of Consumer Protection,
 
Plaintiff-Appellee,
 
v.
 
 
DEBORAH ANN HOKULANI JOSHUA,
 
Defendant/Cross Claim Defendant/Appellant,
 
and
 
 
RONALD R. RABANG and MATTHEW G. AIELLO,
 
Defendants/Cross Claim Plaintiffs/Appellees
 
 
IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
 
(CIVIL NO. 08-1-0240-02)

 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)

 
Upon review of the record on appeal in CAAP-15-0000951,
 
it appears that this court lacks appellate jurisdiction over the
 
 
appeal. Defendant/Cross-Claim Defendant/Appellant Deborah Ann
 
 
Hokulani Joshua (Joshua) appeals from the Honorable Jeannette H.
 
 
Castagnetti's September 25, 2015 "Amended Final Judgment and
 
 
Permanent Injunction in Favor of Plaintiff and Against Defendants
 
Deborah Ann Hokulani Joshua, Ronald R. Rabang and Matthew G.
 
 
Aiello" (September 25, 2015 Amended Final Judgment). 
 
 
 
In CAAP-15-0000046, this court dismissed a prior appeal

 
from the same underlying case for lack of a final appealable
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
judgment. This court noted that there was no final appealable 
judgment in the record on appeal because the judgments that Joshua previously appealed from failed to satisfy Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a), Rule 58 of the Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP), and Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 869 P.2d 1334 (1994). Specifically, this court 
noted that the May 14, 2009 Final Judgment and March 4, 2015 Amended Final Judgment did not specifically identify the claim or claims on which the court intended to enter judgment in favor of OCP and against Joshua, the judgments failed to specifically enter judgment on OCP's claims against Defendants Ronald R. Rabang (Rabang) and Matthew G. Aiello (Aiello), and the judgments did not expressly enter judgment on or state that Rabang's and Aiello's cross claims against Joshua are dismissed. Instead, the judgments only stated that the cross claims were previously dismissed. 
HRS § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2015) authorizes appeals 
from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). HRCP Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." Based on this requirement, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has held that 
"[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
"Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties,

until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v.
 
One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai 'i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008). 
[I]f a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a case
involving multiple claims or multiple parties, the judgment (a)
must specifically identify the party or parties for and against
whom the judgment is entered, and (b) must (i) identify the claims
for which it is entered, and (ii) dismiss any claims not
specifically identified[.]
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (emphases added). 
For example: 'Pursuant to the jury verdict entered on (date),
judgment in the amount of $___ is hereby entered in favor of
Plaintiff X and against Defendant Y upon counts I through IV of
the complaint." . . . . If the circuit court intends that
 claims other than those listed in the judgment language should be
dismissed, it must say so: for example, "Defendant Y's
counterclaim is dismissed," or "Judgment upon Defendant Y's
counterclaim is entered in favor of Plaintiff/Counter-
Defendant Z," or "all other claims, counterclaims, and cross-
claims are dismissed."
 
Id. at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4. When interpreting
 
the requirements for a judgment under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme
 
 
Court of Hawai 'i noted that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face all of
the issues in the case, the burden of searching the often
voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions of
jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the parties nor
counsel have a right to cast upon this court the burden of
searching a voluminous record for evidence of finality, . . . and
we should not make such searches necessary by allowing the parties
the option of waiving the requirements of HRCP [Rule] 58.
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (citation omitted; 
original emphasis). "[A]n appeal from any judgment will be
 
 
dismissed as premature if the judgment does not, on its face,
 
 
either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the
 
 
finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. 
 
(original emphasis). 
 
The September 25, 2015 Amended Final Judgment did not

 
resolve, on its face, all issues in the case. In the Complaint,

Protection (OCP) alleged six claims against Joshua, Counts I through VI, and two claims each against Rabang and Aiello, Counts I and V. Rabang and Aiello each filed a cross claim against Joshua. 
The September 25, 2015 Amended Final Judgment failed to
 
specifically enter judgment or dismiss each claim against each
 defendant and dismiss each cross claim against Joshua. For
 example, paragraph 7 of the September 25, 2015 Amended Final
 Judgment fails to specify which claim or claims "judgment is
 entered in favor of OCP and against Defendants[.]" The September
 25, 2015 Amended Final Judgment also did not identify the
 specific claim or claims in the Complaint that judgment was
 entered upon in favor if OCP in paragraphs 11 and 12. 
In paragraph 19 of the September 25, 2015 Amended Final
 
Judgment, it states "Except as set forth in this Amended Final
 Judgment and Permanent Injunction, all claims by and between OCP
 and Defendant Rabang were released and dismissed with prejudice
 pursuant to the Rabang Judgment." In paragraph 20 of the
 September 25, 2015 Amended Final Judgment, it states "Except as
 set forth in this Amended Final Judgment and Permanent
 Injunction, all claims by and between OCP and Defendant Aiello
 were released and dismissed with prejudice pursuant to the Aiello
 Judgment." Paragraphs 19 and 20 do not state which claims are
 dismissed. 
In addition, dismissal of claims against Rabang and
 
Aiello should have been made on the face of the judgment. HRCP
 Rule 58. Referencing prior judgments to validate that claims

against Rabang and/or Aiello were dismissed causes this court to 
have to search for those prior judgments. "Neither the parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of finality, . . . and we should not make such searches necessary by allowing the parties the option of waiving the requirements of HRCP [Rule] 58. Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. Language such as 
"Count ___ against Defendant(s) ____ is/are dismissed with 
prejudice," would resolve the claims on the face of the judgment. 
The September 25, 2015 Amended Final Judgment also did 
not expressly dismiss Rabang's and Aiello's cross claims. In 
paragraphs 21 and 22, the September 25, 2015 Amended Final Judgment states that Rabang's and Aiello's cross claims "were released and dismissed with prejudice," pursuant to prior judgments. Again, dismissal of the cross claims should have been made on the face of the judgment. HRCP Rule 58 and Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is
 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
