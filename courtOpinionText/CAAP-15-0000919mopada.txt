DANTE RACKLEY, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 12-1-0552)
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: 
Leonard, Presiding Judge, Ginoza and Chan, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Dante Rackley (Rackley) appeals
 
from a Judgment of Conviction and Sentence, filed on October 9,
 
2015, in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit court),1
 
which convicted him of: Count I, Terroristic Threatening in the
 First Degree (TT1) in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 
§ 707-716(1)(e) (Supp. 2011);
2
 and Count II, Place to Keep Pistol
or Revolver (Place to Keep) in violation of HRS § 134-25 (2011).3
  
1 The Honorable Dean E. Ochiai presided.
 
2 At the time of Rackley's indictment, HRS § 707-716(1)(e) provided:
"(1) A person commits the offense of terroristic threatening in the first
degree if the person commits terroristic threatening: . . . (e) With the use
of a dangerous instrument[.]" (Emphasis added.)
 "Dangerous instrument" is defined as "any firearm, whether loaded or
not, and whether operable or not, or other weapon, device, instrument,
material, or substance, whether animate or inanimate, which in the manner it
is used or is intended to be used is known to be capable of producing death or
serious bodily injury." HRS § 707-700 (2014).

 HRS § 134-25 provides:

Rackley was sentenced, in pertinent part, as follows:
 
Count I, incarceration for a mandatory minimum of five (5) years;
Count II, incarceration for ten (10) years; and the terms to run
concurrently with each other.
 
  
On appeal, Rackley contends that the circuit court
 
plainly erred in imposing the five-year mandatory minimum
 sentence for Count I because: (1) the indictment failed to comply
 with the notice and due process requirements of Article I,
 Sections 5, 10, and 14 of the Hawai
'i Constitution; and (2) 
although Rackley waived his right to a jury trial on the charged
 offenses, he did not waive his right to have a jury determine
 applicability of the mandatory minimum sentence under HRS § 706­660.1(3)(d) and (4) (2014).

For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.
 
I. Background
 
On April 10, 2012, the State of Hawai 'i (State) filed 
an indictment against Rackley, charging him with the TT1 and the
 
Place to Keep offenses. With regard to Count I, the TT1 offense,
the indictment alleged as follows:
 
 
COUNT I: On or about the 2nd day of August, 2011, in
the City and County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, DANTE
RACKLEY, threatened, by word or conduct, to cause bodily
injury to Joseph Van Veckhoven, with the use of a dangerous
instrument, to wit, a semiautomatic firearm as defined in
Section 706-660.1 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes, with the
intent to terrorize, or in reckless disregard of the risk of
terrorizing Joseph Van Veckhoven, thereby committing the
offense of Terroristic Threatening in the First Degree, in
violation of Section 707-716(1)(e) of the Hawaii Revised
Statutes.
 
If convicted of this offense or any included felony
offense, DANTE RACKLEY may be subject to sentencing in
accordance with Section 706-661 and Section 706-662(4)(a) of
the Hawaii Revised Statutes where he is a multiple offender
in that he is being sentenced for two or more felonies or is
already under sentence of imprisonment for any felony, and
an extended term of imprisonment is necessary for the
protection of the public. 
(Emphasis added.)
 
On July 13, 2015, Rackley signed a Waiver of Jury
 
Trial, which stated among other things that he was "waiving and
 
giving up [his] right to trial by jury on the present charges." 
A hearing was held in which the circuit court had a colloquy with
 Rackley and found that Rackley freely, voluntarily, knowingly,
 
4(...continued)
length of which shall be as follows:
 
. . . . 
(d) For a class C felony--five years.
 
. . . . 
(4) In this section:
 
. . . .
 
"Semiautomatic firearm" means any firearm that uses
the energy of the explosive in a fixed cartridge to extract
a fired cartridge and chamber a fresh cartridge with each
single pull of the trigger.
 (Emphases added.)

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
intelligently, and with the advice of counsel waived his right to
 
a jury.
 
The circuit court held a jury waived trial and on
 
August 6, 2015, the circuit court orally entered its verdict that
 the "State has proven all of the required elements as to Counts I
 and Count II by proof beyond a reasonable doubt." The circuit
 court found that Rackley had committed terroristic threatening by
 "racking" a firearm, which the circuit court found to be an
 operable Sig Sauer .45 caliber semiautomatic pistol.
 
On October 9, 2015, the circuit court held a hearing
 
regarding Rackley's sentencing and, upon the State's request,
 sentenced Rackley, inter alia, to the five year mandatory minimum
 on the TT1 offense.
 
On October 9, 2015, the circuit court entered the
 
Judgment of Conviction and Sentence. On December 9, 2015,
 Rackley timely filed a Notice of Appeal.
II. Standard of Review
 
A. Plain Error
 
As expressed by the Hawai
'i Supreme Court: 
Hawai'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 52(b) states
that "[p]lain errors or defects affecting substantial rights
may be noticed although they were not brought to theattention of the court." Therefore, an appellate court "mayrecognize plain error when the error committed affects
substantial rights of the defendant." State v. Staley, 91
Hawai'i 275, 282, 982 P.2d 904, 911 (1999) (citation
omitted). 
The appellate court "will apply the plain error standard of
review to correct errors which seriously affect thefairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicialproceedings, to serve the ends of justice, and to prevent
the denial of fundamental rights." Nichols, 111 Hawai' i at 
334, 141 P.3d at 981 (quoting State v. Sawyer, 88 Hawai' i 
325, 330, 966 P.2d 637, 642 (1998)). An appellate court's
"power to deal with plain error is one to be exercisedsparingly and with caution because the plain error rulerepresents a departure from a presupposition of theadversary system—that a party must look to his or hercounsel for protection and bear the cost of counsel's
mistakes." Nichols, 111 Hawai' i at 335, 141 P.3d at 982
(quoting State v. Kelekolio, 74 Haw. 479, 515, 849 P.2d 58,
74–75 (1993)). 
State v. DeLeon , 131 Hawai 'i 463, 479-80, 319 P.3d 382, 398-99 
(2014).

B. Sufficiency of the Indictment
 
Rackley did not challenge the sufficiency of the
 
indictment while the case was before the circuit court. Thus,
 
the liberal construction standard applies in this appeal.
 
Under the liberal construction standard, when a party raises
an objection to the indictment for the first time on appeal,
the indictment is liberally construed. State v. Motta, 66
Haw. 89, 90, 657 P.2d 1019, 1019 (1983). This standard
"means we will not reverse a conviction based upon a
defective indictment unless the defendant can show prejudice
or that the indictment cannot within reason be construed to
 
charge a crime." Id. at 91, 657 P.2d at 1020.
 
State v. Tominiko, 126 Hawai 'i 68, 76, 266 P.3d 1122, 1130 
(2011).
III. Discussion
 
A. Sufficiency of the Indictment
 
Rackley contends that the circuit court plainly erred 
when it imposed the five year mandatory minimum sentence for 
Count I, because the indictment failed to comply with the notice and due process requirements of Article I, Sections 5, 10, and 14 of the Hawai
'i Constitution. He argues that the indictment 
failed to properly notify him that he was subject to mandatory minimum sentencing for use of a semiautomatic firearm in the commission of the TT1 offense, because the indictment only refers to the definition of a semiautomatic firearm in HRS § 706-660.1 and does not specifically state that he may be subject to a mandatory minimum sentence pursuant to HRS § 706-660.1(3)(d). 
Rackley received the mandatory minimum sentence under
 
HRS § 706-660.1(3)(d) related to the TT1 offense, a class C
 felony. See HRS § 707-716(2). As noted above, the indictment on
 
Count I specifically alleged that Rackley used a semiautomatic
 firearm as part of the TT1 offense, which requires "use of a
 dangerous instrument." The indictment alleged in pertinent part
 that:
 
[Rackley] threatened, by word or conduct, to cause bodily
injury to Joseph Van Veckhoven, with the use of a dangerous
instrument, to wit, a semiautomatic firearm as defined in
Section 706-660.1 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes, with the
intent to terrorize, or in reckless disregard of the risk of
terrorizing Joseph Van Veckhoven, thereby committing the
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
offense of Terroristic Threatening in the First Degree, in
violation of Section 707-716(1)(e) of the Hawaii Revised
Statutes.
 
(Emphasis added.) 
We first note that, although Rackley seeks to rely on 
State v. Auld, 136 Hawai 'i 244, 361 P.3d 471 (2015), the Hawai 'i 
Supreme Court recognized in Auld that it was announcing new rules 
that resulted from overruling prior appellate precedent, and thus the supreme court held that the new rules have prospective effect only. Id. at 257, 361 P.3d at 484. Here, Rackley was sentenced 
before the opinion in Auld was issued and thus Auld does not apply to this case.
5 
Nevertheless, as Rackley contends, Hawai 'i case law 
prior to Auld is relevant to whether the indictment properly contained allegations related to the semiautomatic firearm. We disagree with Rackley, however, as to the effect of these cases. Rather than supporting Rackley's contention that the indictment was deficient, applicable Hawai
'i case law establishes that the 
indictment on Count I sufficiently alleged Rackley's use of a semiautomatic firearm. 
In State v. Jess, 117 Hawai
'i 381, 184 P.3d 133, 
(2008), the supreme court noted that "[p]ursuant to the due process and 'grand jury' clauses of the Hawai
'i Constitution, 
which reside respectively in article I, sections 5 and 10, the prosecution must allege all essential elements of an offense in the charging instrument." 117 Hawai
'i at 392-93, 184 P.3d at 
144-45 (footnotes omitted). Moreover, in light of decisions by the United States Supreme Court recognizing the "elemental character" of certain sentencing enhancers, Id. at 398, 184 P.3d 
5 Given other relevant authority discussed herein, even if  Auld did
apply to this case, it would not affect the outcome. Auld
 dealt with whether,
in seeking to have a defendant serve a mandatory minimum sentence as a repeat
offender under HRS § 706-606.5 (2014), the State must include the defendant'spredicate prior conviction(s) in the charging document and must prove theprior conviction(s) to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. 136 Hawai' i at 245­
47, 361 P.3d at 472-74. A prior conviction is not the aggravating sentencingfactor in this case. 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
at 150, the Jess court held that "a charging instrument, be it an
 
indictment, complaint, or information, must include 
all
 
allegations, which if proved, would result in the application of
 a statute enhancing the penalty of the crime committed." Id.
 
(emphasis added and internal quotation marks omitted) (citing
 State v. Apao, 59 Haw. 625, 636, 586 P.2d 250, 258 (1978) and
 State v. Estrada
, 69 Haw. 204, 230, 738 P.2d 812, 829 (1987)).6
 
We note that Jess does not require that the charging
 
document expressly state that the defendant is subject to an
 
enhanced sentence and the reasons therefor. Rather, the charging
document must include "all allegations, which if proved, would
 result in the application of a statute enhancing the penalty of
 the crime committed." Id. at 404, 184 P.3d at 156 (emphasis
 
added). Thus, the requirement is to set forth the alleged facts
 that must be proved in order for the enhanced penalty to apply.
 
 
This court's decision in State v. Kang , 84 Hawai 'i 352, 
933 P.2d 1386 (App. 1997) is particularly instructive. In Kang,
 this court held that:
 
"[D]ue process requires that an indictment contain all the
essential elements of the offenses charged, and the omissionof an essential element of the crime charged is a defect in
substance[.]" State v. Apao, 59 Haw. 625, 634-35, 586 P.2d
250, 257 (1978) (citations and internal quotation marks
omitted). Hence, the State must also "include in theindictment [the allegations, which if proved, would resultin application of a statute enhancing the penalty] for the crime
committed." Apao, 59 Haw. at 636, 586 P.2d at 258. The due process
requirement that aggravating circumstances which support an
"enhanced" sentence be alleged in the charging document thenextends to "sentencing statutes providing for mandatory minimum
prison terms," Schroeder II, 76 Hawai' i at 526 n.13, 880 P.2d at
201 n.13, such as HRS § 706-660.1(3)(d). 
Id. at 357, 933 P.2d at 1391 (footnote omitted). Similar to this
case, the defendant in Kang was charged with TT1. There, the
  
6 Prior to Jess, the rule that "aggravating circumstances must be
alleged in the indictment and found by the jury" only applied to "factualquestions that were enmeshed in or intrinsic to the commission of the crime 
charged[.]" 117 Hawai' i at 394, 184 P.3d at 146 (internal citations and
quotation marks omitted). The supreme court in 
Jess
 determined that the
intrinsic/extrinsic distinction had lost its viability based on then recentUnited States Supreme Court decisions and declined to further follow theintrinsic/extrinsic distinction for enhanced sentencing. 117 Hawai' i at 398,
184 P.3d at 150. 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Complaint alleged that:
 
[Kang], with intent to terrorize, or in reckless disregard
of the risk of terrorizing Whitney Borden, did threaten, by
word or conduct, to cause bodily injury to Whitney Borden
with the use of a dangerous instrument, to wit, a .30-06
 
caliber rifle 
, thereby committing the offense of Terroristic
Threatening in the First Degree in violation of [HRS § 707­
716(1)(d)].
 
Id. at 354, 933 P.2d at 1388 (emphasis added).7 This court noted 
that "[t]he allegation that a rifle was used in the offense may 
have sufficed to meet the requirements of HRS § 706-660.1(1) (1993), which gives the court discretion to impose a mandatory term of imprisonment of three years for use of a 'firearm while engaged in the commission of a felony[.]'" Id., 84 Hawai
'i at 
355-56, 933 P.2d at 1389-90 (citing HRS § 706-660.1(1)). However, the State moved for mandatory minimum imprisonment pursuant to HRS § 706-660.1(3)(d) –- the provision at issue in this case -- which requires a mandatory minimum of five years if a semiautomatic or automatic firearm is used in the commission of a class C felony. Id. at 356, 933 P.2d at 1390. Because the 
complaint in Kang alleged that the defendant used a rifle and did not specify that the rifle was a semiautomatic or automatic firearm, "'the material aggravating circumstance' was not 'sufficiently alleged'" for a mandatory minimum sentence pursuant to HRS § 706-760.1(3)(d). Id. (citation omitted). In short, 
Kang indicates that if the complaint in that case had alleged use of a semiautomatic firearm, it would have been sufficient for a mandatory minimum sentence under HRS § 706-660.1(3)(d). 
Here, the indictment of Rackley contains the allegation
 
that was missing in Kang. That is, the indictment here alleges
 that the dangerous instrument used was a "semiautomatic firearm,"
 
7
 Although Kang was decided before Jess and applies the 
intrinsic/extrinsic distinction, it provides authoritative guidance because
Kang determined that the alleged use of a rifle was an aggravatingcircumstance "enmeshed in the commission of terroristic threatening becausethe rifle was used to threaten the complaining witness." Thus, the State wasrequired to allege use of a firearm in order to subject the defendant to anenhanced sentence. Kang, 84 Hawai' i at 355, 933 P.2d at 1389. In short, the
alleged use of the firearm was an "intrinsic" fact which the State wasrequired to assert in the charging document. Id. 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
and moreover, the indictment cites to HRS § 706-660.1. Thus, 
unlike in Kang, the indictment in this case sufficiently alleged the facts that would result in the application of HRS § 706­660.1(3)(d), the statute enhancing the penalty for TT1. Jess, 
177 Hawai
'i at 398, 184 P.3d at 150. 
We also find guidance in State v. Schroeder, 76 Hawai 'i 
517, 880 P.2d 192 (1994). There, the defendant was indicted on two counts, Robbery in the First Degree (Robbery 1) and 
Kidnapping. Id. at 518-19, 880 P.2d at 193-94. The Robbery 1 
count alleged that the defendant committed the offense "while 
armed with a dangerous instrument, to wit, a handgun[.]" Id. at 519, 880 P.2d at 194 (emphasis omitted). The Kidnapping count did not allege use of a handgun. After a jury-waived bench trial, the defendant was found guilty on both counts. Id. at 
519-20, 880 P.2d at 194-95. Subsequently, the circuit court sentenced the defendant to, inter alia, mandatory minimum prison terms of ten years on both counts pursuant to HRS § 706-660.1. Id. at 521, 880 P.2d at 196. 
Like the instant case, the defendant in Schroeder 
challenged the sufficiency of the indictment related to the mandatory minimum sentencing and asserted the challenge for the first time on appeal. 76 Hawai
'i at 529, 880 P.2d at 204. In 
this regard, the supreme court first noted that "[w]e have held that charges will not be found to be defective where the record demonstrates that they tracked the relevant statutory language and that the defendant clearly understood the accusations and mounted a viable defense at trial." 
Id.8
 (citation omitted). 
The supreme court determined that the indictment in Schroeder
 satisfied the prescribed criteria and that "our review of the
 record establishes that Schroeder understood the accusations and
 
8
 This is similar to the liberal construction standard reiterated in 
Tominiko that, where a charging document is challenged for the first time on
appeal, an appellate court "will not reverse a conviction based upon adefective indictment unless the defendant can show prejudice or that theindictment cannot within reason be construed to charge a crime." 126 Hawai' i 
at 76, 266 P.3d at 1130 (citation omitted). 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
mounted a viable defense at trial." Id. The supreme court
 
further noted that the defendant did not challenge the
 
sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions. Id. 
Additionally, the supreme court emphasized that the ultimate
 objective of requiring allegations that enhance criminal
 penalties to be included in the charging document (referenced by
 the court as the "Estrada rule") was to ensure that a defendant
 had fair notice of the charges. Id. at 530, 880 P.2d at 205. 
"With this objective in mind, an indictment must be read in a
 common-sensical fashion in order to ascertain whether the
 material aggravating circumstance has been sufficiently alleged
 therein to support the imposition of enhanced sentencing." Id.
 
(emphasis added). Given the above principles, the Schroeder
 court determined that a plain reading of both counts in the
 indictment, reasonably construed, established that use of a
 handgun was alleged in both the Robbery 1 and Kidnapping
 charges.
9 Id.
 
Here, considering the principles discussed in 
Schroeder, the indictment on the TT1 charge is drawn in the language of the statute and asserts the essential elements of the offense. Moreover, the record establishes that Rackley understood the accusations against him, including the alleged use of the semiautomatic firearm and that he mounted a viable defense represented by defense counsel. Rackley also does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction. Furthermore, reading the indictment in a "common-sensical fashion in order to ascertain whether the material aggravating circumstance has been sufficiently alleged therein to support the imposition of enhanced sentencing," Schroeder, 76 Hawai
'i at 530, 
880 P.2d at 205, we conclude that the material aggravating 
9
 Although the Schroeder court ruled that the indictment was not 
deficient as to the mandatory minimum sentences on both counts, the court
ultimately vacated the mandatory minimum on the kidnapping count because theState's motion and arguments to the circuit court had not in fact soughtmandatory minimum sentencing on the kidnapping count. Schroeder, 76 Hawai' i 
at 532, 880 P.2d at 207. 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
circumstance of using a semiautomatic firearm in the commission
 
of the TT1 offense is sufficiently alleged.
 
Therefore, Rackley's indictment did not violate the 
notice and due process requirements of the Hawai 'i Constitution 
and there was no plain error in this regard.
B. Waiver of Jury Trial
 
Rackley also challenges the circuit court's imposition
 
of the five year mandatory minimum sentence because, although he
 acknowledges having waived his right to a jury trial for the
 charged offenses and does not raise any issue on appeal as to
 that waiver, he claims he did not waive a jury trial as to the
 enhanced sentencing factor that he used a semiautomatic weapon.
 Rackley points to case law from the United States Supreme Court
 holding that "facts that increase mandatory minimum sentences
 must be submitted to the jury[.]" Alleyne v. United States, 133
 
S. Ct. 2151, 2163 (2013); see also Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530
 U.S. 466, 490 (2000) ("Other than the fact of a prior conviction,
 any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the
 prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and
 proved beyond a reasonable doubt.").
 
Rackley signed the Waiver of Jury Trial, which provided
 
in pertinent part: "I am now and forever voluntarily waiving and
 giving up my right to trial by jury on the present charges." As
 stated above, the TT1 charge in the indictment included that
 Rackley "threatened, by word or conduct, to cause bodily injury
 to Joseph Van Veckhoven, with the use of a dangerous instrument,
 to wit, a semiautomatic firearm as defined in Section 706-660.1
 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes[.]" (Emphasis added.) For a TT1
 offense, the State must prove that a person commits terroristic
 threatening "[w]ith the use of a dangerous instrument" and the
 definition of "dangerous instrument" includes a "firearm." HRS
 §§ 707-716(1)(e) and 707-700. Thus, in order to prove Rackley
 guilty of the TT1 offense, the State in this case had to prove,
 at a minimum, that Rackley committed terroristic threatening with
 the use of a firearm.
 
11
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
At the jury waived trial, Ralph Neil Dumaran, an
 
evidence specialist with the Honolulu Police Department,
 
testified that he executed a search warrant for Rackley's car and
 found a Sig Sauer handgun in the rear of the front passenger seat
 and the handgun was submitted into evidence as Exhibit 1. The
 State, without objection from Rackley, presented an expert
 witness, Curtis Kubo, who testified that the firearm submitted
 into evidence as Exhibit 1 was a "Sig Sauer, Model 220 –- P220,
 caliber .45 auto, double-action, semiautomatic pistol[.]" 
In addition, Rackley testified at trial. He testified
 
that on the date in question, he had an altercation with certain
 individuals outside a bar/restaurant in Waikiki, went to his car,
 grabbed a firearm for protection, went back to the area where the
 altercation had occurred to look for his date, and there was a
 crowd of people. Rackley testified that he was scared, "[p]ulled
 my shirt up, and I grabbed the hold –- the handle of the -– Sig
 Sauer. I flashed it. . . . This is -– I was just reacting, and I
 flashed the gun." He also testified at one point that he
 "brandished the weapon, I pulled it, cleared it to make sure
 there wasn't a round in it." Rackley testified that the Sig
 Sauer, entered as Exhibit 1, was registered to him. Moreover,
 and importantly, he testified that he knows it is a semiautomatic
 and he knew when he took the gun out of the car on the date of
 the incident that it was a semiautomatic. 
When the circuit court returned the verdict, it
 
concluded:
 
[The] State has proven the elements required for
Terroristic Threatening in the First Degree . . . beyond a
reasonable doubt. The defendant, by racking the firearm,
did intend to terrorize, or did so in reckless disregard of
terrorizing Joseph Van Veckhoven on August 2, 2011. In
 conjunction, defendant's statements of, "I'll be back," and,
"You don't want to mess with this," clearly indicates to the
Court the defendant's intent to terrorize. 
The firearm in question has been found to be an
operable Sig Sauer .45 caliber 
semiautomatic pistol that was
loaded with live ammunition cartridges and is a dangerous
instrument under Hawaii Revised Statutes 706-660.1.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
12
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Thus, based on the evidence presented at the jury
 
waived trial, the circuit court concluded that the State had
 
proven the TT1 charge, a class C felony, beyond a reasonable
 doubt and that Rackley had used a semiautomatic firearm during
 the commission of the felony.
 
At the sentencing hearing, the State asserted, inter
 
alia, that a mandatory minimum sentence of five years was
 required for the TT1 offense. Rackley's trial counsel responded,
 stating: "Your Honor, we also agree with the law on this case,
 that you have to give the open term, of [sic] with a mandatory
 five out of five on the terroristic threatening. And the other
 one, you have discretion."
 
Given the circumstances of this case, we conclude there
 
was no plain error with regard to whether Rackley properly waived
 jury trial on the enhanced factor of use of a semiautomatic
 firearm. First, Rackley expressly waived his "right to trial by
 jury on the present charges" and the indictment on Count I
 included the allegation that he used a semiautomatic firearm.
 
Second, in proving Rackley's guilt on the TT1 offense,
 
the use of a dangerous instrument, here at minimum a firearm, was
 a necessary element. Thus, even if his jury trial waiver is
 viewed narrowly, he undisputedly waived his right to a jury trial
 at least to the extent that use of a firearm was a necessary part
 of the guilt phase. See Jones v. Hulick, 449 F.3d 784, 791
 
(2006) ("The obvious problem Jones encounters on his Apprendi
 claim is that he waived the jury, the judge found him guilty
 beyond a reasonable doubt of aggravated vehicular hijacking at
 the guilt phase of the trial, and that was the basis for his life
 sentence. Necessarily, then, the sentencing factor–-aggravated
 vehicular hijacking--was found beyond a reasonable doubt[.]").
 
Finally, Rackley has admitted that he knew the firearm
 
that he "flashed" or "brandished" during the incident in question
 was a semiautomatic firearm. The United States Supreme Court has
 recognized that an enhanced sentence can be based on facts found
 by a jury or facts admitted by the defendant. Blakely v.

Plain error review must be exercised sparingly and 
cautiously, "to correct errors which seriously affect the 
fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings, to serve the ends of justice, and to prevent the denial of fundamental rights." DeLeon, 131 Hawai
'i at 480, 319 
P.3d at 399 (citation omitted). Given the circumstances of this case, we conclude there was no plain error. Thus, the circuit court did not plainly err when it sentenced Rackley to the five year mandatory minimum sentence on the TT1 offense.
