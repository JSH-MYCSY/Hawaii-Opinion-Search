IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
SCOTT B. SMITH, Petitioner-Appellant,
v.
 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent-Appellee.
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P. NO. 13-1-0008(2), CR. NO. 99-0325(2))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION OPINION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Scott B. Smith (Smith) appeals
 
from the Order filed by the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit

 
1
 (Circuit Court) on November 3, 2015 (November 2015 Order), in
Smith's post-conviction proceeding, S.P.P. No. 13-1-0008, which
 
was brought pursuant to Hawai 'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) 
Rule 40 (2006). The November 2015 Order denied Smith's "Motion
 to Recalculate Multiple Terms of Imprisonment Mandated by Act
 194" (Motion to Recalculate Sentence)
2
 without prejudice to the
issue being raised by Smith in a proper proceeding. We affirm.
 
1The Honorable Peter T. Cahill presided over the proceedings relevant to
this appeal.
 
2The reference to "Act 194" in Smith's Motion to Recalculate Sentence 
appears to be a reference to Act 194 enacted during the Hawai' i Legislature's
2015 legislative session. 2015 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 194, at 587. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
I.
 
A.
 
In his underlying criminal case, Smith was convicted
 
after a jury trial of the lesser included offense of first-degree
 assault (Count 1); first-degree terroristic threatening (Count
 2); first-degree sexual assault (Counts 3, 4, 5, and 6);
 kidnapping (Count 8); and use of a deadly or dangerous weapon in
 the commission of a crime (Count 9). The Circuit Court sentenced
 Smith to a total of forty-five years of imprisonment by imposing
 the following terms of imprisonment consecutive to each other:
 (1) concurrent twenty-year terms of imprisonment on Counts 3, 4,
 5, and 6, (2) a ten-year term of imprisonment on Count 1, (3) a
 ten-year term of imprisonment on Count 8, and (4) concurrent
 five-year terms of imprisonment on Counts 2 and 9.
 
Smith filed a direct appeal from the Circuit Court's 
judgment of conviction and sentence. In a published opinion filed in 2004, which contains a detailed description of the evidence presented at Smith's trial, this court affirmed the Circuit Court's judgment of conviction and sentence. State v. 
Smith, 106 Hawai
'i 365, 105 P.3d 242 (2004). The Hawai 'i Supreme 
Court denied Smith's application for writ of certiorari. 
B.
 
On July 29, 2013, Smith filed in S.P.P. No. 13-1-0008,
 
a "Petition for Post-Conviction Relief" pursuant to HRPP Rule 40
 (Petition) that asserted seven grounds for relief. On September
 24, 2013, Smith filed a "Motion for Permission to Re-Argue My
 Direct Appeal Based on DNA" and a document entitled "Note" which
 raised additional grounds for relief. On November 7, 2013, the
 Circuit Court denied Smith's Petition and issued its "Findings of
 Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Judgment Denying Rule 40 Petition
 for Post-Conviction Relief" (Order Denying Petition).
3
 
3In its Order Denying Petition, the Circuit Court did not address the
additional grounds for relief raised by Smith in the documents he filed on
September 24, 2013. 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Smith filed a notice of appeal from the Order Denying
 
Petition, which initiated appellate case No. CAAP-13-0005313 in
 
this court. In a Summary Disposition Order filed on July 31,
 2015, this court affirmed the Circuit Court's Order Denying
 Petition. We entered our judgment on appeal on September 3,
 2015, and the supreme court denied Smith's application for writ
 of certiorari on November 10, 2015.
 
C.
 
In the meantime, after this court entered its judgment
 
on appeal in No. CAAP-13-0005313 but before the supreme court
 denied certiorari, Smith filed in S.P.P. No. 13-1-0008 (the same
 post-conviction proceeding as the Order Denying Petition) his
 Motion to Recalculate Sentence on October 27, 2015. Smith sought
 relief pursuant to "Act 194." He also requested the appointment
 of a lawyer to help him with his Act 194 claim and the recusal of
 Judge Cahill because Smith claimed that Judge Cahill assigned him
 a lawyer, but then denied him the right to speak to the lawyer
 "before [Judge Cahill] signed the judgmen[t]." Smith further
 claimed that there was "no record of the whole procedure."
 
On November 3, 2015, the Circuit Court issued its
 
November 2015 Order. The Circuit Court found that it had
 appointed the Public Defender's Office to represent Smith
 pursuant to his request that his sentence be recalculated and
 that it had not issued any order denying Smith the ability to
 contact or speak with his court-appointed counsel. The Circuit
 Court further noted that Smith had appealed the Order Denying
 Petition, that this court had issued its judgment on appeal in
 September 2015, and that the Circuit Court was "unable to
 ascertain whether it has jurisdiction" because it did not know
 whether Smith had filed for certiorari. The Circuit Court
 ordered that Smith's Motion to Recalculate Sentence be "denied
 without prejudice to the issue being raised in the proper
 proceeding." It further ordered that nothing in the November
 2015 Order shall be construed to prevent Smith from contacting 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the Public Defender's Office in those matters where it has been
 
appointed as Smith's counsel.
 
II.
 
Smith filed a "Motion for Direct Appeal of Judgment by
 
Peter T. Cahill on and Only on Act 194 Recalculate Multiple Terms
 of Imprisonment and or Reconsideration," which we construe as a
 notice of appeal from the November 2015 Order. By order dated
 May 26, 2016, and consistent with Smith's apparent intent, we
 accepted documents filed by Smith on April 14, 2016, as his
 opening brief.
 
Smith's reference to "Act 194" in his Motion to 
Recalculate Sentence appears to be a reference to Act 194 enacted by the Hawai
'i Legislature in 2015. 2015 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 194 
(Act 194) at 587. Act 194 amended Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 706-668.5 effective July 1, 2015, by adding subsection (3), which states that for terms of imprisonment imposed prior to June 18, 2008, the Department of Public Safety (DPS) shall provide notice to defendants that DPS may recalculate the multiple terms of imprisonment imposed on the defendants and of their right to have the court review their sentence. As amended by Act 194, HRS § 706-668.5 provides: 
(1) If multiple terms of imprisonment are imposed on a
defendant, whether at the same time or at different times,
or if a term of imprisonment is imposed on a defendant who
is already subject to an unexpired term of imprisonment, the
terms may run concurrently or consecutively. Multiple terms
of imprisonment run concurrently unless the court orders or
the statute mandates that the terms run consecutively.
 
(2) The court, in determining whether the terms
imposed are to be ordered to run concurrently or
consecutively, shall consider the factors set forth in
section 706–606.
 
(3) For terms of imprisonment imposed prior to June
18, 2008, the department of public safety shall post written
notice in all inmate housing units and the facility library
at each correctional facility for a period of two months and
send written notice to the defendant no later than January
1, 2016, that shall include but not be limited to:
 
(a)	 Notice that the department of public safety may
recalculate the multiple terms of imprisonment
imposed on the defendant; and
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(b)	 Notice of the defendant's right to have the
court review the defendant's sentence.
 
HRS § 706-668.5 (Supp. 2016).
 
As explained by the conference committee report on the
 
bill that was ultimately enacted as Act 194, the purpose of Act
 
194 was as follows:
 
Your Committee on Conference finds that prior to 2008,
section 706-668.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, relating to
imposition of multiple terms of imprisonment, provided that
the terms run consecutively unless the court specifically
ordered that the terms run concurrently. Act 193, Session
Laws of Hawaii 2008, amended section 706-668.5, Hawaii
Revised Statutes, and provided that multiple terms of
imprisonment run concurrently unless the court specifically
orders that the terms run consecutively. This measure
 attempts to bring parity to the treatment of defendants
sentenced to multiple terms prior to the effective date of
Act 193, which is June 18, 2008, and those sentenced to
multiple terms after that date while providing defendants
with adequate notice regarding the possibility of their
multiple terms of imprisonment being recalculated by the
Department and their rights to have the court review their
sentences.
 
Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 158, in 2015 Senate Journal, at 796.
 
III.
 
The Circuit Court denied Smith's Motion to Recalculate
 
Sentence, but without prejudice to his raising the issue in a
 
proper proceeding. Smith filed his Motion to Recalculate
 Sentence in S.P.P. No. 13-1-0008 at a time when the final Order
 Denying Petition in that proceeding was on appeal. Therefore,
 the Circuit Court was correct that Smith's filing of the Motion
 to Recalculate Sentence in S.P.P. No. 13-1-0008 was not "proper." 
On the other hand, HRPP Rule 40 does not appear to preclude a
 prisoner from filing (or the Circuit Court from assuming
 jurisdiction over) an HRPP Rule 40 petition raising new claims
 for relief while an order issued in an HRPP Rule 40 proceeding is
 on appeal. Therefore, the Circuit Court could have treated the
 Motion to Recalculate Sentence as a new HRPP Rule 40 petition. 
In any event, the Circuit Court denied the Motion to Recalculate
 Sentence without prejudice to Smith raising his Act 194 claim in
 another proceeding. Because Smith is free to file an HRPP Rule
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
40 petition raising a claim under Act 194, and given the muddled
 
record relating to his Act 194 claim, we conclude that the
 Circuit Court did not err in denying without prejudice Smith's
 Motion to Recalculate Sentence.
 
IV.
 
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the Circuit Court's
 
November 2015 Order.
