IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS

STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
SEQUIOA FINE, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-CR. NO. 15-1-1780)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai 'i (State) charged 
Defendant-Appellant Sequioa Fine (Fine) with harassment, in
 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 711-1106(1)(a)
 (2014).
1 After a bench trial, the Family Court of the First
 
2
 Circuit (Family Court) found Fine guilty as charged.  Fine
 
appeals from the Family Court's Judgment, which was entered on
 November 17, 2015. 
1HRS ยง 711-1106 provides in relevant part:
 
(1) A person commits the offense of harassment if, with
intent to harass, annoy, or alarm any other person, that person:
 
(a)	 Strikes, shoves, kicks, or otherwise touches another
person in an offensive manner or subjects the other
person to offensive physical contact;
 
. . . .
 
(2) Harassment is a petty misdemeanor.

On appeal, Fine contends that his conviction should be 
vacated and the case remanded for a new trial because the Family 
Court: (1) failed to properly advise him of his right to testify pursuant to Tachibana v. State, 79 Hawai
'i 226, 900 P.2d 1293 
(1995); (2) erred in admitting the complaining witness's written statement; (3) erred in admitting the complaining witness's oral statement; and (4) erred in asking questions of a witness. The State concedes that the Family Court's Tachibana advisement was deficient and that the deficient advisement was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 
We conclude that the Family Court erred in failing to 
properly advise Fine of his rights as required by Tachibana. See 
Tachibana, 79 Hawai
'i at 236 n.7, 900 P.2d at 1303 n.7. Fine did 
not testify and we cannot say that the Family Court's error was harmless. See State v. Hoang, 94 Hawai
'i 271, 279, 12 P.3d 371, 
379 (App. 2000). Given our resolution of Fine's Tachibana claim, we need not address the remainder of his points of error on appeal.

Based on the foregoing, we vacate the Family Court's
 
Judgment, and we remand the case for a new trial.
