SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Brian Shigemi Miyake (Miyake)
 
appeals from the "Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law; Order
 
Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and for
 Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure Filed February 21, 2014" and
 the "Judgment" entered on November 18, 2015 by the Circuit Court
 of the First Circuit (Circuit Court).

On appeal, Miyake alleges that the Circuit Court erred
 
in granting summary judgment in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee Bank
 of America, N.A., Successor by Merger to BAC Home Loans
 Servicing, LP formerly known as Countrywide Home Loans Servicing
 LP (Bank of America) because (1) a genuine issue of material fact
 remained as to whether Bank of America had standing to foreclose
 on the subject mortgage and (2) the Circuit Court should have

 The Honorable Bert I. Ayabe presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
given Miyake more time to conduct discovery pursuant to Hawai 'i 
Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 56(f). 
After due consideration of the point raised, the 
parties' arguments, the record on appeal, and applicable legal 
authorities we resolve Miyake's points on appeal as follows. 
The Hawai 'i Supreme Court recently reiterated that 
"[i]n order to prove entitlement to foreclose, the foreclosing party must demonstrate that all conditions precedent to foreclosure under the note and mortgage are satisfied and that all steps required by statute have been strictly complied with." 
Bank of America, N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo
, __ Hawai 'i __, __ P.3d __, 
No. SCWC-15-0000005, 2017 WL 772603 at *4 (Feb. 28, 2017). Furthermore, "[a] foreclosing plaintiff must also prove its entitlement to enforce the note and mortgage." Id. "A 
foreclosing plaintiff's burden to prove entitlement to enforce the note overlaps with the requirements of standing in foreclosure actions as 'standing is concerned with whether the parties have the right to bring suit.'" Id., at *5 (brackets 
omitted) (quoting Mottl v. Miyahira, 96 Hawai
'i 381, 388, 23 P.3d 
716, 723 (2001)). Because "standing relates to the invocation of the court's jurisdiction, it is not surprising that standing must be present at the commencement of the case." Reyes-Toledo, 
at *5. A plaintiff who does not have standing to enforce the note that has been defaulted on also does not have standing to foreclose on the mortgaged property. See id.
, at *5. 
Like the foreclosing bank in Reyes-Toledo,  Bank of 
America attached two documents to its motion for summary judgment to demonstrate that it possessed the subject Note: (1) a declaration of Lisa K. Townsend-Brown (Townsend-Brown), whereby Townsend-Brown declared that Bank of America, "directly or through an agent, has possession of the promissory note" and (2) the Note, which was indorsed in blank. Neither document
 establishes Bank of America had possession of the Note at the
 commencement of this action. Because Bank of America failed to
 meet its burden of demonstrating that it was entitled to judgment

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
as a matter of law, the Circuit Court erred in granting Bank of
 
America's motion for summary judgment. See Reyes-Toledo, at *7.2
 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Findings of Fact and
 
Conclusions of Law; Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary
 Judgment and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure Filed
 February 21, 2014" and "Judgment" both entered on November 18,
 2015 by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit are vacated and
 this case is remanded for further proceedings.

Honolulu, Hawai 'i, March 30, 2017.

 Because we hold that the Circuit Court erred in granting Bank of
America's motion for summary judgment, we need not address Miyake's remaining
point on appeal.
