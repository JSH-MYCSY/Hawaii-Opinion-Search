v.
 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P.
 NO. 15-1-0013(2) (CR. NO. 96-0078(2))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
 
This appeal arises out of the seventh petition for 
post-conviction relief filed by Petitioner-Appellant Gerald 
Villanueva (Villanueva). On October 14, 2015, Villanueva filed a pleading entitled "Motion for a Judicial Review Pursuant to HRS. 91-94." The Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (Circuit Court) ordered that this pleading be treated and filed as a nonconforming petition under Hawai
'i Rules of Penal Procedure 
(HRPP) Rule 40 (2006). On November 19, 2015, the Circuit Court1 
denied Villanueva's nonconforming petition without a hearing and filed its "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Judgment Denying Petitioner's Non-Conforming HRPP Rule 40 Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner from Custody" (Order Denying Seventh Petition). The Circuit Court ruled that Villanueva's claims "have no colorable basis, have previously been raised and ruled upon, are patently

frivolous, or are without a trace of support in the record or
 
from other evidence submitted by [Villanueva]." 
Villanueva appeals from the Order Denying Seventh 
Petition. While Villanueva's arguments for relief are difficult to understand, it appears that they arise out of the Hawai
'i 
Supreme Court's reference to his conviction on Count 2 as being for "[p]ossession" or use of a firearm in the commission of a separate felony instead of for "carrying" or use of a firearm in the commission of a separate felony in its 1998 decision on his direct appeal. The supreme court reversed Villanueva's conviction on Count 2 in its 1998 decision, but affirmed his conviction and concurrent twenty-year term of incarceration on Count 1. 
We recently rejected the same claim Villanueva raises
 
in this appeal in our decision affirming the denial of his sixth
 post-conviction petition. See Villanueva v. State, No. CAAP-15Â­
0000408, 2016 WL 1296031 (Mar. 30, 2016) (SDO). In that
 decision, we held that "[t]he supreme court's use [of] the term
 "possession" rather than "carrying" in describing the offense
 charged in Count 2 is inconsequential and does not provide
 Villanueva with any basis for relief." Villanueva, 2016 WL
 
1296031, at *2.
 
We conclude that the claims raised by Villanueva in his
 
seventh petition for post-conviction relief did not raise a
 colorable claim for relief and have been previously ruled upon or
 have been waived. See HRPP Rule 40(a)(3), (f), (g)(2). We
 
affirm the Circuit Court's Order Denying Seventh Petition.
