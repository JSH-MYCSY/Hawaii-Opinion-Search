ORDER DENYING JUNE 8, 2016 HRAP RULE 40
MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF MAY 26, 2016
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF STANDING
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) the May 26, 2016 order dismissing
 
appeal for lack of standing, (2) Non-Party/Appellant Bobby Ray
 
Narmore's (Appellant Narmore) June 8, 2016 motion for
 reconsideration of the May 26, 2016 dismissal order pursuant to
 Rule 40 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP), and 
(3) the record, it appears that Appellant Narmore did not file
 his June 8, 2016 HRAP Rule 40 motion for reconsideration within
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
ten days after the filing of the May 26, 2016 dismissal order, as
 
HRAP Rule 40(a) expressly requires, and, thus, Appellant
 Narmore's June 8, 2016 HRAP Rule 40 motion for reconsideration is
 untimely under HRAP Rule 40(a). Furthermore, it appears that we
 did not overlook or misapprehend any points of law or fact when
 we entered the May 26, 2016 dismissal order. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellant
 
Narmore's June 8, 2016 HRAP Rule 40 motion for reconsideration of
 the May 26, 2016 dismissal order is denied.
