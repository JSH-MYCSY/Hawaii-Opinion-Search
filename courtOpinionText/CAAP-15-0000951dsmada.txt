VONAH DITUS, FRED DITUS and STONE DITUS,
Petitioners-Appellees,
v.
 
ANGELA COURT and ROGER COURT,
Respondents-Appellants
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 3SS-15-1-0230)

 
ORDER DISMISSING THE APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Upon review of records in CAAP-15-0000951, it appears that
 
this court lacks appellate jurisdiction. Respondents-Appellants
 
Roger Court and Angela Court, pro se (collectively Appellants)
 appeal from the August 10, 2015 Order Granting Mutual Injunction
 Against Harassment in District Court case no. 3SS-15-1-0230. A
 notice of appeal must be filed within 30 days after entry of an
 appealable judgment or order. HRAP Rule 4(a)(1). Appellants
 filed a Notice of Appeal on December 15, 2015. Therefore, the

appeal is untimely. The failure to file a timely notice of
 
appeal in a civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the
 parties cannot waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in
 the exercise of judicial discretion. Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw.
 
648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986). Accordingly, the court
 lacks appellate jurisdiction over the appeal. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is dismissed for
 
lack of appellate jurisdiction.
