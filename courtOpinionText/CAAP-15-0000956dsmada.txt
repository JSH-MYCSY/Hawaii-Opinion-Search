APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR
 
LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION

 
AND
 
DISMISSING ALL PENDING MOTIONS AS MOOT 

(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
jurisdiction over this appeal that Defendant-Appellant Elvira
 
Raguine Mariano (Appellant Elvira Mariano) has asserted in Civil
 No. 13-1-2439-09, the Honorable Bert I. Ayabe presiding,
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
apparently from (1) a June 1, 2015 judgment on a decree of 
foreclosure and (2) the circuit court's July 1, 2015 court minutes, because (1) Appellant Elvira Mariano's December 16, 2015 notice of appeal is untimely under Rule 4(a)(1) of the Hawai
'i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) as to the June 1, 2015 judgment on the decree of foreclosure, and, (2) the July 1, 2015 circuit court minutes do not constitute an appealable order. 
As the Supreme Court of Hawaii has explained, a minute 
order is not an appealable order." Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, 
Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai
'i 319, 321 n.3, 966 P.2d 631, 633 n.3 
(1998) (emphasis added). Therefore, Appellant Elvira Mariano is not entitled to appeal from the circuit court's July 1, 2015 minutes. 
Although the June 1, 2015 judgment on the decree of
 
foreclosure is an appealable final judgment pursuant to Hawaii
 Revised Statutes § 667-51(a) (Supp. 2015), HRAP Rule 4(a)(1)
 required Appellant Elvira Mariano to file her notice of appeal
 within thirty days after entry of the June 1, 2015 judgment on
 the decree of foreclosure. Appellant Elvira Mariano did not file
 her December 16, 2015 notice of appeal within thirty days after
 entry of the June 1, 2015 judgment on the decree of foreclosure,
 and, thus, Elvira Mariano's notice of appeal is untimely under
 HRAP Rule 4(a)(1). The failure to file a timely notice of appeal
 in a civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the parties
 cannot waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in the
 exercise of judicial discretion. Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648,
 
650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or
 judge or justice is authorized to change the jurisdictional
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
requirements contained in Rule 4 of these rules."); HRAP Rule
 
26(e) ("The reviewing court for good cause shown may relieve a
 party from a default occasioned by any failure to comply with
 these rules, except the failure to give timely notice of
 appeal."). Therefore, we lack appellate jurisdiction over
 Appellant Elvira Mariano's appeal in appellate court case number
 CAAP-15-0000956. 
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
 
case number CAAP-15-0000956 is dismissed.
 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions
 
in appellate court case number CAAP-15-0000956 are dismissed as
 moot.
