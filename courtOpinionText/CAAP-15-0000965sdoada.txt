STEPHAN DAMON MITCHELL, Petitioner-Appellee, v.
MAGGIE ANGELA HUNG, Respondent-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(FC-DA NO. 15-1-1403)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, and Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
This appeal arises out of a dispute involving an Order
for Protection filed by Petitioner-Appellee Stephan Damon
Mitchell, pro se, against Respondent-Appellant Maggie Angela
Hung, and entered pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS")
section 586-5.51 on July 7, 2015, by the Family Court of the
First Circuit ("Family Court").2  Hung appeals from the Family
Court's (1) November 2, 2015 Order Denying Motion to Dissolve
Existing Order Filed On: October 14, 2015 ("Order Denying the
Motion to Dissolve") and (2) December 1, 2015 order denying
Hung's November 12, 2015 Hawai #i Family Court Rules ("HFCR") Rule
1/HRS section 586-5.5 provides in relevant part:
(a) If, after hearing all relevant evidence, the court
finds that the respondent has failed to show cause why the
order should not be continued and that a protective order is
necessary to prevent domestic abuse or recurrence of abuse,
the court may order that a protective order be issued for a
further fixed reasonable period as the court deems
appropriate.

2/The Honorable Kevin A. Souza presided.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
59 motion for reconsideration of the Order Denying the Motion to
Dissolve ("Order Denying the Motion for Reconsideration").3
On appeal, Hung contends that the Family Court erred in
denying her October 14, 2015 Motion and Declaration to Dissolve
the Existing Order ("Motion to Dissolve") (1) when it "fail[ed]
to allow [Hung] to appear [at] the hearing in person"; (2) when
it failed to require that Mitchell present "solid proof" that
Hung physically abused him; (3) when Hung "didn't get a chance to
represent herself [at the July 7, 2015 hearing] due to breach of
justice"; and (4) when Hung was "stranded in [Texas] because she
didn't have any funds to go back to Hawaii to appear [at] the
[July 7, 2015] hearing because [Mitchell] never sen[t] her any
money at all and didn't want her to appear in court to fight
against the [restraining order]."4
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Hung's
contentions as follows and affirm.
Hung's Motion to Dissolve was brought under HFCR Rule
60(b)(1).  A trial court's denial of a motion under HFCR Rule
60(b) is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard. 
Citicorp Mortg., Inc. v. Bartolome , 94 Hawai #i 422, 428, 16 P.3d
827, 833 (App. 2000). 
Hung fails to establish that the Family Court abused
its discretion in denying her Motion to Dissolve.  The bulk of
3/Hung's Notice of Appeal did not reflect an appeal from the
underlying July 7, 2015 Order for Protection.  Despite that, Hung claims in
her opening brief to appeal from the Order for Protection.  Any such appeal,
however, would be untimely and was waived when no one timely appealed from the
Order for Protection or filed any tolling motion after issuance of the July 7,
2015 order.  Haw. R. App. 4(a)(1); Riethbrock v. Lange , 128 Hawai #i 1, 17, 282
P.3d 543, 559 (2012).  Therefore, we treat the arguments advanced in Hung's
opening brief as addressed to the November 2, 2015 Order Denying the Motion to
Dissolve.  See infra n.4.
4/Although Hung's Notice of Appeal claims to appeal from the Order
Denying the Motion for Reconsideration, her opening brief does not appear to
address any arguments toward that order.  Accordingly, the issue is waived. 
In re Guardianship of Carlsmith , 113 Hawai #i 236, 246, 151 P.3d 717, 727
(2007) (noting that this court may "disregard a particular contention if the
appellant makes no discernible argument in support of that position" (quoting
Norton v. Admin. Dir. of the Court , 80 Hawai #i 197, 200 908 P.2d 545, 548
(1995)) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)).
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
her points of error are waived because they were not raised below
or supported here by any discernible argument, or have no
apparent bearing on, or are demonstrably inapplicable to, the
HFCR Rule 60(b)(1) standards for relief.  Her fourth point,
however, touches upon the argument advanced in her Motion to
Dissolve, that she failed to attend the hearing on Mitchell's
Petition for an Order for Protection ("Petition") because she was
allegedly misinformed about the consequences of appearing. 
Therefore, we construe Hung's fourth point of error to assert
that the Family Court erred when it held in its March 21, 2016
Supplemental Record on Appeal [Findings of Fact and Conclusions
of Law & Order] that Hung's failure to appear at the July 7, 2015
hearing on Mitchell's Petition resulted from Hung's "inexcusable
neglect and/or [a] willful act."  See BDM, Inc. v. Sageco, Inc.
57 Haw. 73, 76, 549 P.2d 1147, 1150 (1976) (holding that a motion
to set aside a default entry may be granted wherever the court
finds "(1) that the nondefaulting party will not be prejudiced by
the reopening, (2) that the defaulting party has a meritorious
defense, and (3) that the default was not the result of
inexcusable neglect or a willful act.")  This court has held
"that the third ground is dispositive."  Pogia v. Ramos , 10 Haw.
App. 411, 415-16, 876 P.2d 1342, 1345 (1994).
The Family Court found Hung in default when she failed
to appear at the hearing on Mitchell's Petition, and, after
conducting a proof hearing under HFCR 55(b), granted the Order
for Protection.  Hung's Motion to Dissolve requested that the
Family Court set aside the Order for Protection "based upon [her]
being misinformed about the consequences of appearing."  Her
accompanying declaration informed the Family Court of her reasons
for non-appearance.
In ruling on the Motion to Dissolve, the Family Court
concluded that "there is no doubt that the default resulted from
[Hung's] own 'inexcusable neglect' and/or 'willful act'" because
"the credible and reliable evidence suggests that [Hung]
intentionally chose not to appear at the court hearing on July 7,
2015."  The record supports the Family Court's conclusion. 
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
First, Hung's declaration attached to the Motion to
Dissolve confirms that Hung chose not to attend the July 7, 2015
hearing because she feared that "if [she] lost the TRO [she]
would be put into jail."  Second, a colloquy between Hung, Hung's
attorney, and the Family Court establishes that Hung received the
June 23, 2015 Notice of Hearing, understood the Notice of
Hearing, and chose not to attend the July 7, 2015 hearing.  
Third, Hung does not explain any mistake, misunderstanding, or
misapprehension, and does not appear to contest the facts stated
in Mitchell's Petition, while the transcript of the July 7, 2015
hearing reflects that the Family Court conducted a proof hearing
pursuant to HFCR 55(b) at which time the court examined Mitchell,
and only thereafter issued the Order for Protection.  Hung does
not rebut the Family Court's finding that she was not present in
court, that she had not asked the court to excuse her from
appearing in person, and that three calls were made for her prior
to commencing the hearing.  Likewise, Hung does not explain why
she was unable or unwilling to appear by telephone, as she did on
other occasions, and therefore not subject herself to the
perceived threat of arrest and prosecution.
Accordingly, the Family Court's denial of the Motion to
Dissolve on the basis that Hung's non-appearance resulted from
inexcusable neglect and/or a willful act, notwithstanding her
lack of legal sophistication, is well-supported by the record,
and not an abuse of discretion.  See Jack v. Jack, No. CAAP-12-
0000044, 2015 WL 836925 at *2 (Hawai #i App. Feb. 26, 2015)
(finding no abuse of discretion when the family court denied a
motion to set aside because the motion focused solely on the
reasons for appellant's non-appearance); see also Pogia , 10 Haw.
App. at 417, 876 P.2d at 1345-46 ("[L]ack of legal sophistication
cannot form the basis of a claim of excusable neglect for the
purposes of [HRCP] Rule 60(b) where the defendant, after
receiving notice, failed to appear or answer." (quoting Original
Appalachian Artworks v. Yuil Int'l Trading Corp., 105 F.R.D. 113,
116 (1985)) (ellipses and internal quotation marks omitted)).  In
sum, Hung did not establish that she had a meritorious defense to
the underlying action, that her failure to appear at the hearing
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
on Mitchell's Petition was not a willful act, or that the Family
Court manifestly abused its discretion in denying the Motion to
Dissolve.
Therefore, we affirm the Order Denying Motion to
Dissolve Existing Order Filed on: October 14, 2015, filed on
November 2, 2015, and the Order Denying Respondent's Motion for
Reconsideration Filed on November 12, 2015, filed on December 1,
2015, in the Family Court of the First Circuit.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, February 28, 2018.
