APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD

ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Upon review of the record in CAAP-16-0000005 it appears
 
that this court lacks appellate jurisdiction over the appeal. 
Claimant-Appellant Dwight J. Vicente (Appellant) purports to
 appeal from a "Motion for Reconsideration of Attorney's Fees
 Approval of the Director File Dated Aug. 19, 2015 and Appeals
 Board Order Denying Stay filed dated Dec. 24, 2015" in the Labor
 and Industrial Relations Appeals Board (LIRAB) case no. AB 2015­259(H).

Pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 386-88  and
HRS § 91-14(a), an aggrieved party may appeal a decision and

 
order by the LIRAB directly to the Hawai 'i Intermediate Court of 
Appeals.2
 
The appeal of a decision or order of the LIRAB is governed
by HRS § 91-14(a), the statute authorizing appeals in
administrative agency cases. HRS § 91-14(a) authorizes judicial
review of a final decision and order in a contested case or a
 preliminary ruling of the nature that deferral of review pending
entry of a subsequent final decision would deprive appellant of
adequate relief. For purposes of HRS § 91-14(a), we have defined
"final order" to mean an order ending the proceedings, leaving
nothing further to be accomplished. . . . Consequently, an order
is not final if the rights of a party involved remain undetermined
or if the matter is retained for further action.

Hawai'i 436, 439, 974 P.2d 1026, 1029 (1999) (citation and some 
internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added). The Supreme
 
Court of Hawai 'i has "held that an order that finally adjudicates 
a benefit or penalty under the worker's compensation law is an
 appealable final order under HRS § 91-14(a), although other
 issues remain." Lindinha v. Hilo Coast Processing Co., 104

 "The decision or order of the appellate board shall be final and
conclusive, except as provided in section 386-89, unless within thirty days
after mailing of a certified copy of the decision or order, the director or
any other party appeals to the intermediate appellate court, subject to
chapter 602, by filing a written notice of appeal with the appellate board, or
by electronically filing a notice of appeal in accordance with the Hawaii
rules of appellate procedure." HRS § 386-88.

 HRS § 91-14(a) provides:
 
§ 91-14 Judicial review of contested cases. (a) Any person
aggrieved by a final decision and order in a contested case or by
a preliminary ruling of the nature that deferral of review pending
entry of a subsequent final decision would deprive appellant of
adequate relief is entitled to judicial review thereof under this
chapter; but nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent
resort to other means of review, redress, relief, or trial de
novo, including the right of trial by jury, provided by law.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the
contrary, for the purposes of this section, the term “person
aggrieved” shall include an agency that is a party to a contested
case proceeding before that agency or another agency.

There is no final order by LIRAB that adjudicated any
 
issues in Appellant's appeal from a June 3, 2015 Decision by the
 
Director of the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations. 
The appeal to this court is premature and this court lacks
 appellate jurisdiction. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is
 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
