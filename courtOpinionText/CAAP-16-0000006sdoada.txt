APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 15-1-0999)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant State of Hawai 'i (State) appeals 
from a December 8, 2015 "Order Granting Motion to Dismiss
 
Counts VI and VIII of the Amended Felony Information with
 Prejudice" (Order) entered by the Circuit Court of the First
 
1
Circuit (Circuit Court)  in favor of Defendant-Appellee Eric N.
Yokota (Yokota). The Order dismissed Count VI, Theft in the
 Second Degree (Theft Second), a violation of HRS § 708-831(1)(b)
 
2
(2014) , and Count VIII, Identity Theft in the Second Degree, a
violation of HRS § 708-839.7 (2014)
3.
 
1 The Honorable Dexter D. Del Rosario presided.

 At the time of alleged the offense, HRS § 708-831 provided, "Theft
 
in the second degree. (1) A person commits the offense of theft in the second
degree if the person commits theft: . . . (b) Of property or services the
value of which exceeds $300[.]"
 
HRS § 708-830 (2014) defines theft, in relevant part, "A person
commits theft if the person does any of the following: . . . (2) Property
obtained or control exerted through deception. A person obtains, or exerts
control over, the property of another by deception with intent to deprive the
other of the property."

 HRS § 708-839.7, provides:
 
Identity theft in the second degree.  (1) A person commits

the offense of identity theft in the second degree if that

On appeal, the State contends the Circuit Court erred
 
by concluding that the State was barred as a matter of law from
 
charging Yokota with Theft Second for passing five fraudulently
 executed checks amounting to $720 over the course of six days as
 a continuing course of conduct.
 
After reviewing the parties' arguments, the record on
 
appeal, and the relevant legal authorities, we resolve the
 State's appeal as follows, vacate the Order and remand for
 further proceedings.
 
"The test to determine whether a crime may be charged 
on a continuous conduct theory is whether the language, structure, and purpose of the statute reveals a legislative intent to criminalize continuing conduct." State v. Decoite, 132 
Hawai
'i 436, 438, 323 P.3d 80, 82 (2014) (interpreting HRS § 
701–108(4) (Supp. 2006)); State v. Martin, 62 Haw. 364, 368-69, 616 P.2d 193, 196-97 (1980) (interpreting HRS § 708-831(1)(b)). Here, the statutory and case law illustrate a legislative intent to allow the treatment of theft crimes as continuing courses of 
4
conduct. HRS § 708-801(6) (2014);  State v. Stenger, 122 Hawai 'i 
271, 226 P.3d 441 (2010) (defendant charged with Theft First by deception not entitled to specific unanimity instruction because as charged and argued by the prosecution, theft by deception is a continuous offense); Martin, id. 
The parties agree that the charges were dismissed as a
 
matter of law. Therefore, the Circuit Court erred in dismissing
 
3(...continued)
person makes or causes to be made, either directly or
indirectly, a transmission of any personal information of
another by any oral statement, any written statement, or any
statement conveyed by any electronic means, with the intent
to commit the offense of theft in the second degree from any
person or entity.
 
(2)
 Identity theft in the second degree is a class B
felony.
 
4
 HRS § 708-801(6) provides in part, "[a]mounts involved in thefts
committed pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct, whether the property
taken be of one person or several persons, may be aggregated in determining
the class or grade of the offense."

Counts VI and VIII on the basis that they could not be charged as
 
continuing courses of conduct.5
 
Based on the foregoing, the December 8, 2015 "Order
 
Granting Motion to Dismiss Counts VI and VIII of the Amended
 Felony Information with Prejudice" entered by the Circuit Court
 of the First Circuit is vacated and this case is remanded for
 further proceedings consistent with this Summary Disposition
 Order.

 Yokota argues that the State did not preserve its point of error
with regard to Count VIII, maintaining that the State preserved no discernable
argument with regard to this count. However, the Circuit Court dismissed
Count VIII along with Count VI for the same reason: the State could not
 aggregate the cashed checks as a continuing course of conduct in one count.
As we have concluded that this decision was incorrect, the State's argument
with regard to Count VI was sufficient to support its claim of error as to
Count VIII.
