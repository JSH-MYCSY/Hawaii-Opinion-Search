STATE OF HAWAI #I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
HUNNIE VAA, Defendant-Appellant.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(HONOLULU DIVISION)
(CASE NO. 1P1120007061)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai# i (State) charged
Defendant-Appellant Hunnie Vaa (Vaa) with third-degree assault. 
After a bench trial, the District Court of the First Circuit
(District Court)1/ found Vaa guilty as charged.  The District
Court entered its Judgment on December 7, 2015.
On appeal, Vaa contends that: (1) the District Court
failed to properly advise Vaa of the right to testify as required
by Tachibana v. State , 79 Hawai #i 226, 900 P.2d 1293 (1995); (2)
there was insufficient evidence to support Vaa's conviction; and
(3) the District Court failed to accord Vaa the right to
allocution at sentencing.  We vacate the District Court's
Judgment and remand the case for a new trial.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2I.
We resolve the arguments raised by Vaa on appeal as
follows:
1.The State concedes that the District Court's
Tachibana advisement was deficient because it failed to include
the advisement that if Vaa wanted to testify, no one could
prevent Vaa from doing so.  See Tachibana , 79 Hawai #i at 236 n.7,
900 P.2d at 1303 n.7.  The State also concedes that this error
was not harmless.  See State v. Hoang , 94 Hawai #i 271, 279, 12
P.3d 371, 379 (App. 2000).  We agree with the State's concession
of error as it is supported by the record and well-founded in
law.  State v. Hoang , 93 Hawai #i 333, 336, 3 P.3d 499, 502
(2000).
2.We reject Vaa's claim that there was insufficient
evidence to identify Vaa as the perpetrator of the charged
assault.  In particular, Vaa contends that the complaining
witness's in-court identification of Vaa "created a substantial
likelihood of irreparable misidentification and should not have
been deemed reliable as evidence" by the District Court. 
However, Vaa did not move to preclude, and did not object at
trial to, the complaining witness's in-court identification. 
Therefore, the District Court was entitled to consider the
complaining witness's in-court identification.  See State v.
Samuel, 74 Haw. 141, 147, 838 P.2d 1374, 1378 (1992) ("The
general rule is that evidence to which no objection has been made
may properly be considered by the trier of fact and its admission
will not constitute grounds for reversal."); State v. Wallace , 80
Hawai#i 382, 410, 910 P.2d 695, 723 (1996) ("[T]he rule is well
settled that evidence even though incompetent, if admitted
without objection or motion to strike, is to be given the same
probative force as that to which it would be entitled if it were
competent." (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).  
At trial, the complaining witness identified Vaa as the
person who punched the complaining witness in the head, causing
the complaining witness to feel pain.  The complaining witnessNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
3testified that she was positive it was Vaa who punched her.  When
viewed in the light most favorable to the State, and recognizing
the province of the trier of fact to determine the credibility of
witnesses and the weight of the evidence, we conclude that the
evidence presented was sufficient to support Vaa's conviction. 
See State v. Smith, 106 Hawai #i 365, 372, 105 P.3d 242, 249 (App.
2004).
3.The State concedes that the District Court failed
to accord Vaa the right to allocution at sentencing.  We agree
with this concession of error.  See  Hawai #i Rules of Penal
Procedure Rule 32(a) (2012); State v. Schaefer , 117 Hawai #i 490,
497-98, 184 P.3d 805, 812-13 (App. 2008); Hoang, 93 Hawai# i at
336, 3 P.3d at 502. 
II.
Based on the foregoing, we vacate the District Court's
Judgment and remand the case for a new trial.  The standard
remedy for a violation of the right to allocution is to remand
the case for resentencing before a different judge.  Schaefer ,
117 Hawai #i at 498, 184 P.3d at 813.  In this case, however, the
case is being remanded for retrial, and not just for
resentencing.  Out of an abundance of caution and to avoid any
issue at sentencing if Vaa is found guilty after a retrial, we
direct that on remand the case be assigned to a different judge.
