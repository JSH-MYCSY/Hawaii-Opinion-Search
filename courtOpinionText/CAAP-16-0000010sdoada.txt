 HRS § 291C-13 (Supp. 2014) provides, in relevant part:
 
The driver of any vehicle involved in an accident
resulting only in damage to a vehicle or other property that
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Meloche argues that the District Court wrongly
 
convicted her based on insufficient evidence. Specifically, she
 
maintains that the court abused its discretion in finding her
 testimony—that she made two hotel stops before arriving at the
 Sheraton Waikiki Hotel (the "Sheraton") and observed no marks on
 the vehicle driven by the complaining witness ("CW")—to be not
 credible; and based on that credibility determination,
 unreasonably concluded—contrary to Meloche's testimony—that she
 did not stop on Punahou Street after the accident. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Meloche's points of error as follows, and affirm.
 
On appeal, the evidence is reviewed in the light most 
favorable to the prosecution. State v. Matavale, 115 Hawai
'i 
149, 157, 166 P.3d 322, 330 (2007) (quoting State v. Batson, 73 Haw. 236, 248, 831 P.2d 924, 931 (1992)). "The test on appeal is not whether guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt, but whether there was substantial evidence to support the conclusion of the trier of fact." Id. at 157-58, 166 P.3d at 330-31 
(quoting Batson, 73 Haw. at 248, 831 P.2d at 931). "Substantial evidence as to every material element of the offense charged is credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion." State v. Tarape, 107 Hawai
'i 519, 523, 115 P.3d 
698, 702 (App. 2005) (quoting State v. Richie, 88 Hawai 'i 19, 33, 
960 P.2d 1227, 1241 (1998)) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
"[A]s trier of fact, the trial judge is free to make 
all reasonable and rational inferences under the facts in evidence, including circumstantial evidence." Matavale, 115 
Hawai
'i at 158, 166 P.3d at 331 (quoting Batson, 73 Haw. at 249, 
is driven or attended by any person shall immediately stop
such vehicle at the scene of the accident or as close
 thereto as possible, but shall forthwith return to, and in
every event shall remain at, the scene of the accident until
the driver has fulfilled the requirements of section
291C-14.

831 P.2d at 931). It is well-settled that "[t]he appellate court 
will neither reconcile conflicting evidence nor interfere with the decision of the trier of fact based on the witnesses' credibility or the weight of the evidence." State v. Mitchell, 
94 Hawai
'i 388, 393, 15 P.3d 314, 319 (App. 2000) (citing State 
v. Gabrillo, 10 Haw. App. 448, 457, 887 P.2d 891, 895 (1994)). 
Construing the evidence in the light most favorable to
 
the State, as we must, there was substantial evidence that
 Meloche violated HRS section 291C-13. It is undisputed that CW's
 vehicle and Meloche's vehicle collided at the intersection of
 Nehoa Street and Punahou Street. CW testified that she was
 unable to pull over on Punahou Street right after the accident
 and continued driving mauka on Punahou Street until she reached
 Lanihuli Street and found a place to park and briefly assess the
 damage to her car, before circling back. She knew she had to
 "hurry back down." When she returned to the scene, Meloche's
 vehicle was not there. CW proceeded makai down Punahou Street,
 where she spotted Meloche's vehicle ahead of her. At that point,
 "way under ten minutes" had elapsed since the accident. CW
 followed Meloche's vehicle to the Sheraton, where it stopped to
 drop off passengers and where CW got out of her car and
 approached Meloche. 
Although Meloche testified to the contrary as to some
 
issues and stated explicitly that she had pulled over on Punahou
 Street for about ten minutes to assess damage and wait to see if
 the other car would return, the District Court concluded that it
 believed the CW, and thus disbelieved Meloche as to the central
 issue of pulling over and fulfilling the requirements of HRS
 section 291C-14. We are not in a position to second guess the
 District Court's determinations regarding conflicting evidence or
 witness credibility. Based on CW's testimony, which the District
 Court credited, there was substantial evidence to support the
 conclusion that Meloche intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly
 failed to immediately stop at the scene of the accident or as
 close thereto as possible.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of
 
Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, filed in the
