IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI #I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
DEWITT LONG, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CR. NO. 12-1-1613)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Nakamura, Chief Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
In this consolidated appeal,1 Defendant-Appellant
Dewitt Long (Long) appeals, in CAAP-16-0000014, from the
December 11, 2015 Judgment of Conviction and Sentence and in
CAAP-16-0000535, from the June 24, 2016 Findings of Fact,
Conclusions of Law and Order Denying Defendant Dewitt Long's
Motion for Reduction of Sentence, entered by the Circuit Court of
the First Circuit2 (Circuit Court).
On appeal, Long argues that (1) the Circuit Court
abused its discretion in severing the charges pertaining to each
complaining witness; (2) there was insufficient evidence
establishing a chain of custody for the admission of Long's boxer
shorts into evidence; (3) there was insufficient evidence to
support his conviction for sexual assault offenses against
complaining witness N.T.; (4) there was insufficient evidence to
support his conviction for sexual assault offenses against
complaining witness K.C.; and (5) the Circuit Court abused its

discretion in sentencing Long to extended and consecutive terms
of imprisonment.  Long also argues that the Circuit Court abused
its discretion when it denied Long's motion for reduction of
sentence (Motion for Reduction).
1. Severance of Charges
Long argues that the Circuit Court erred by severing
the trials for N.T. and K.C. because "severing the cases . . .
led to exponentially increased proceedings and ultimately
enhanced punishments."  Long's argument is without merit.
 Long not only failed to raise this argument before the
Circuit Court, but specifically requested that the Circuit Court
sever the counts involving K.C. from those involving N.T. and
subsequently confirmed that request.  Long has therefore waived
this argument.  State v. Moses , 102 Hawai #i 449, 456, 77 P.3d
940, 947 (2003) ("As a general rule, if a party does not raise an
argument at trial, that argument will be deemed to have been
waived on appeal; this rule applies in both criminal and civil
cases."). 
2. Chain of Custody
In showing chain of custody, all possibilities of
tampering with an exhibit need not be negated. Chain of
custody is sufficiently established where it is reasonably
certain that no tampering took place, with any doubt going
to the weight of the evidence.  An accounting of
hand-to-hand custody of the evidence between the time it is
obtained and the time admitted to trial is not required in
establishing chain of custody.  And despite the mere
possibility that others may have had access to the exhibits,
there exists a reasonable certainty that no tampering took
place.
State v. DeSilva, 64 Haw. 40, 41, 636 P.2d 728, 730 (1981)
(citations omitted).
Long does not allege that someone tampered with the
exhibit--Long's boxer shorts recovered when he was arrested--but
argues that the Circuit Court should not have admitted the boxer
shorts into evidence in light of the delay in submitting the
evidence to the evidence custodian.  At trial, the evidence
specialist testified that he (1) obtained possession of Long's
boxer shorts from Officer Dang on October 22, 2012 at the Kapolei
police station, (2) placed them in a locked evidence locker at
HPD for which only he had the key, and (3) did not alter,
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
substitute, or tamper with the boxer shorts, nor did he allow
anyone else access to the boxer shorts while the exhibit was in
his care and custody.  The evidence specialist also testified
that the delay until October 30, 2012 in submitting this evidence
to the evidence custodian could be due to his working on other
cases or the need to process the items--such as photographing
them--prior to submitting the evidence to the evidence custodian.
Based on this record, and in light of Long's failure to
point to evidence of tampering, the Circuit Court did not abuse
its discretion in admitting the boxer shorts into evidence.  See
DeSilva, 64 Haw. at 41, 636 P.2d at 730.
3. Sufficiency of Evidence--N.T.
Long's claim that there was insufficient evidence
supporting his conviction for the counts relating to N.T. is
without merit.  Long argues that there was insufficient evidence
to support his sexual assault convictions involving N.T.3 because
3Long was charged with the following:
COUNT 9: On or about the 9th day of May, 2011, to and
including the 10th day of May, 2011, in the City and County
of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, DEWITT LONG did knowingly
engage in sexual penetration with N.T., who was at least
fourteen years old but less than sixteen years old, by
inserting his penis into her genital opening, and DEWITT
LONG was not less than five years older than N.T. and was
not legally married to her, thereby committing the offense
of Sexual Assault in the First Degree, in violation of
Section 707-730(1)(c) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes.
. . . .
COUNT 10 : On or about the 9th day of May, 2011, to and
including the 10th day of May, 2011, in the City and County
of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, DEWITT LONG did knowingly
engage in sexual contact with N.T., who was at least
fourteen years old but less than sixteen years old, or did
cause N.T. to have sexual contact with DEWITT LONG, by
placing his mouth on her breast, and DEWITT LONG was not
less than five years older than N.T. and was not legally
married to her, thereby committing the offense of Sexual
Assault in the Third Degree in violation of Section
707-732(1)(c) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes.

COUNT 11 : On or about the 9th day of May, 2011, to and
including the 10th day of May, 2011, in the City and County

N.T.'s version of the incident was "complete [sic] implausible." 
Specifically, Long contends that N.T.'s version of events was
implausible because "N.[T.] claimed she was afraid something bad
was going to happen to her while with [Long]," however, she never
tried to escape or ask for help during the course of events on
the night that she was sexually assaulted.  Long's claim that
N.T.'s story was "implausible" goes to the credibility of N.T.'s
testimony.  It is well-settled that "[a]n appellate court will
not pass upon the trial judge's decisions with respect to the
credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence, because
this is the province of the trial judge."  State v. Eastman , 81
Hawai#i 131, 139, 913 P.2d 57, 65 (1996).  N.T. testified that
Long "stuck his penis in [her] vagina," sucked her breasts, and
3(...continued)
placing his hand on her breast, and DEWITT LONG was not less
than five years older than N.T. and was not legally married
to her, thereby committing the offense of Sexual Assault in
the Third Degree in violation of Section 707-732(1)(c) of
the Hawaii Revised Statutes.
HRS §§ 707-730 (2014) and -732 (2014) provide, in relevant part:
§ 707-730 Sexual assault in the first degree.   (1) A
person commits the offense of sexual assault in the first
degree if:
. . . .
(c) The person knowingly engages in sexual
penetration with a person who is at least
fourteen years old but less than sixteen years
old; provided that:
(i) The person is not less than five years
older than the minor; and
(ii) The person is not legally married to the
minor[.]
§ 707-732 Sexual assault in the third degree.  (1) A
person commits the offense of sexual assault in the third
degree if:
(c) The person knowingly engages in sexual contact
with a person who is at least fourteen years old
but less than sixteen years old or causes the
minor to have sexual contact with the person;
provided that:
(i) The person is not less than five years
older than the minor; and
(ii) The person is not legally married to the
minor[.]

touched her breasts with his hands.  There was substantial
evidence to support the Circuit Court's conclusion that Long was
guilty of Counts 9 thorough 11.
4. Sufficiency of Evidence--K.C.
Long argues that there was insufficient evidence to
support his convictions for the sexual assault of K.C.4 because
"there was no DNA evidence to prove that [Long] ever placed his
fingers in K.C.'s vagina" and "[t]here was no evidence of any DNA
or semen belonging to Long on K.C."  Long, however, provides no
legal support for his argument that the State was required to
submit evidence that his DNA was recovered from K.C. in order to
sustain his convictions for sexual assault in the first degree. 
"Sufficient evidence to support a conviction can be
established through the testimony of a single witness."  State v.
Smith, 106 Hawai #i 365, 372, 105 P.3d 242, 249 (App. 2004).  At
trial, K.C. testified that she was thirteen years old on
October 21, 2012.  She further testified that Long put "his
fingers into [her] vagina" and that Long "put his penis into
[her] vagina."   K.C.'s version of events on the night in
question was corroborated by the testimony of one of her friends
who was with her that night, by Officer Rivera who witnessed what
appeared to be sexual intercourse between Long and K.C. through
the bedroom window, and by the presence of K.C.'s DNA on Long's
boxer shorts.  Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable
to the prosecution, there was substantial evidence to support the
4With regard to K.C., Long was charged with the following:
COUNT 1: On or about the 21st day of October, 2012, in
the City and County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, DEWITT
LONG did knowingly engage in sexual penetration with K.C.,
who was less than fourteen years old, by inserting his penis
into her genital opening, thereby committing the offense of
Sexual Assault in the First Degree, in violation of Section
707-730(1)(b) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes.
. . . .
COUNT 3: On or about the 21st day of October, 2012, in
the City and County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, DEWITT
LONG did knowingly engage in sexual penetration with K.C.,
who was less than fourteen years old, by inserting his
finger into her genital opening, thereby committing the
offense of Sexual Assault in the First Degree, in violation
of Section 707 -730(1)(b) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes.

jury's verdict.  See State v. Richie, 88 Hawai #i 19, 33, 960 P.2d
1227, 1241 (1998); see also State v. West , 95 Hawai #i 452, 464,
24 P.3d 648, 660 (2001).  The State, therefore, presented
sufficient evidence to support Long's convictions for Sexual
Assault in the First Degree.
5.  Sentencing
Long argues that the Circuit Court abused its
discretion by sentencing him to extended and consecutive terms of
imprisonment.  Long does not challenge the Circuit Court's
authority to impose either extended or consecutive terms nor does
he dispute that the jury found the State proved beyond a
reasonable doubt that Long was a multiple offender and that it
was necessary for the protection of the public to extend his
sentence from a twenty-year term to a life sentence of
imprisonment.  See HRS § 706-662 (2014); see also  HRS § 706-664
(2014).   Rather, without identifying any support presented in
the record, Long argues only that "a twenty year sentence would
have been more than sufficient" in light of factors we presume
Long gleaned from HRS § 706-606 (2014).5
5HRS § 706-606 requires that the sentencing court consider the
following factors in determining the particular sentence to be imposed:
(1) The nature and circumstances of the offense and the
history and characteristics of the defendant; 
(2) The need for the sentence imposed:
(a) To reflect the seriousness of the offense, to
promote respect for law, and to provide just
punishment for the offense;
(b) To afford adequate deterrence to criminal
conduct;
(c) To protect the public from further crimes of the
defendant; and
(d) To provide the defendant with needed educational
or vocational training, medical care, or other
correctional treatment in the most effective
manner; 
(3) The kinds of sentences available; and 
(4) The need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities
among defendants with similar records who have been
found guilty of similar conduct.
6NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Long fails to present specific argument with respect to
the imposition of consecutive sentences. "[A]bsent clear evidence
to the contrary, it is presumed that a sentencing court will have
considered all the factors."  State v. Hussein , 122 Hawai# i 495,
518, 229 P.3d 313, 336 (2010) (citation, internal quotation
marks, ellipses, emphasis, and some brackets omitted).   However,
the sentencing court "should explain its rationale for each
consecutive sentence in order to inform the defendant and
appellate courts of the specific factors underlying each
sentence."  State v. Barrios, 139 Hawai #i 321, 337, 389 P.3d 916,
932 (2016).  While the Circuit Court specifically stated that it
decided upon Long's sentence after consideration of statutory
factors, mitigating factors and the testimony presented at trial,
and identified the victims' ages, multiple counts, extensive
criminal history, and failure to benefit from previous court
supervision, the Circuit Court also made and emphasized findings
relating to the fact that there were two separate victims in two
separate incidents involved in these offenses.  Counts 1, 3, and
8 related to K.C.  Counts 9, 10, and 11 related to N.T.  The
Circuit Court, however, denied the State's motion to make the
sentences in Counts 1, 3, and 8 consecutive to sentences in
Counts 9, 10, and 11.  Thus, the fact that the offenses involved
two separate victims in two separate incidents does not appear to
support making the sentence in Count 8 consecutive to the
sentences in Counts 1 and 3.  Therefore, there is no clear
rationale for the imposition of consecutive sentences in this
case.  See , Barrios , 139 Hawai #i at 337, 389 P.3d at 932 ("the
sentencing court should specify that basis or identify another
basis for determining how many consecutive sentences to impose").
Given our resolution of this issue, we do not reach
Long's argument that his sentence constituted cruel and unusual
punishment.
Therefore, we vacate the December 11, 2015 Judgment of
Conviction and Sentence in CAAP-16-0000014 to the extent it
imposes consecutive sentences and remand for resentencing before
7NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
another judge.  As the sentence Long challenges in CAAP-16-
0000535 has been vacated, we dismiss this appeal as moot.
