(CIVIL NO.12-1-0245)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Ginoza, C.J., and Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
Defendants-Appellants Jill Amaral and Noah Beatty
(collectively "Appellants") appeal from the December 10, 2015
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting
Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure
Against all Defendants on Complaint Filed April 26, 2012
("Order") and the December 10, 2015 Judgment on Findings of Fact,
Conclusions of Law and Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for
Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure Against all Defendants
on Complaint Filed April 26, 2012 ("Judgment"), both entered by
the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit ("Circuit Court")1/ in
favor of Plaintiff-Appellee Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC ("Ocwen")2/
1/The Honorable Glenn S. Hara presided.
2/This action was originally filed by Onewest Bank, FSB ("Onewest")
on April 26, 2012.  Ocwen was substituted as plaintiff for this case on
March 9, 2015 when the Circuit Court entered an Order Granting Plaintiff's
Non-hearing Motion for Order Substituting Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC as
Plaintiff. On January 22, 2016, after Appellants filed their January 11, 2016NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
and against Appellants.
On appeal, Appellants argue that the Circuit Court
erred by granting Ocwen's motion for summary judgment and decree
of foreclosure based on evidence which was authenticated only by
hearsay. 
Upon careful review of the record and briefs submitted
by the parties and having given due consideration to the
arguments and issues they raise, as well as the relevant
statutory and case law, we resolve Appellants' point of error as
follows, and we vacate and remand for further proceedings.
Appellants' primary contention on appeal is essentially
that Ocwen did not produce any admissible evidence that it was in
possession of the original promissory note ("Note") at the time
it filed its motion for summary judgment.  Appellants argue that
the Declaration of Vanessa Lewis in support of Ocwen's motion for
summary judgment ("Lewis Declaration") was inadmissible hearsay
because the "notorious robo-signer Vanessa Lewis" is not Ocwen's
custodian of records and had insufficient personal knowledge to
authenticate Ocwen's "business records," which included the Note. 
However, the threshold issue, which is dispositive in
this appeal, is not whether Ocwen was in possession of the Note
at the time it filed its motion for summary judgment, but rather,
whether Onewest, as the original foreclosing plaintiff, was in
possession of the blank-indorsed Note at the time it filed the
Complaint for Foreclosure ("Complaint"), and therefore entitled
to enforce the Note when the action commenced under  Bank of Am.,
N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo , 139 Hawai #i 361, 390 P.3d 1248 (2017).  In
Reyes-Toledo , the Hawai# i Supreme Court held that in order to
establish a right to judicially foreclose, the foreclosing
Notice of Appeal identifying Ocwen as the plaintiff-appellee, and after the
entry of the December 10, 2015 Order and corresponding Judgment, Federal
National Mortgage Association was substituted as plaintiff for this case when
the Circuit Court entered an Order Granting Plaintiff's Non-Hearing Motion for
Order Substituting Federal National Mortgage Association as Plaintiff.
Ocwen takes the position that it remains the plaintiff for
purposes of this appeal and asserts in its answering brief that, "[a]lthough
Appellant(s) have chosen to unilaterally change the Plaintiff identification
on appeal; this Answering Brief does not subscribe to that unilateral act."
Appellants did not address this matter, as they did not file a reply brief. 
Given the record at the time the Judgment was entered, we continue to identify
Ocwen as the plaintiff.

plaintiff must establish standing, or entitlement to enforce the
subject note, at the time the action was commenced. 139 Hawai #i
at 367-70, 390 P.3d at 1254-57.  Consequently, we consider the
issue irrespective of Appellants' failure to raise it.
Typically, to be entitled to a decree of foreclosure, a
foreclosing plaintiff and the movant, in satisfying their initial
burden for summary judgment, must prove "the existence of an
agreement, the terms of the agreement, a default by the mortgagor
under the terms of the agreement, and giving of the cancellation
notice."  Id. at 367, 390 P.3d at 1254 (citing Bank of Honolulu
v. Anderson , 3 Haw. App. 545, 551, 654 P.2d 1370, 1375 (1982)). 
Additionally, "[a] foreclosing plaintiff must also prove its
entitlement to enforce the note and mortgage[,]" as defined under
Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") section 490:3-301.3/  Id. (citing
Haw. Rev. Stat. ยง 490:3-301 (2008)).  
As a threshold matter, the supreme court noted that
"[a] foreclosing plaintiff's burden to prove entitlement to
enforce the note overlaps with the requirements of standing in
foreclosure actions as '[s]tanding is concerned with whether the
parties have the right to bring suit.'"  Id. at 367, 390 P.3d at
1254 (quoting Mottl v. Miyahira , 95 Hawai #i 381, 388, 23 P.3d
716, 723 (2001)).  Moreover, "[a]s standing relates to the
invocation of the court's jurisdiction, it is not surprising that
standing must be present at the commencement of the case."  Id.
at 368, 390 P.3d at 1255 (citing Sierra Club v. Haw. Tourism
Auth., 100 Hawai #i 242, 257, 59 P.3d 877, 892 (2002)).  In
holding that the foreclosing party failed to satisfy its burden
as the movant for summary judgment, the supreme court reasoned
that "[a]lthough Bank of America produced evidence that it
3/HRS section 490:3-301 provides: 
"Person entitled to enforce" an instrument means (i) the
holder of the instrument, (ii) a nonholder in possession of
the instrument who has the rights of a holder, or (iii) a
person not in possession of the instrument who is entitled to
enforce the instrument pursuant to section 490:3-309 or
490:3-418(d). A person may be a person entitled to enforce the
instrument even though the person is not the owner of the
instrument or is in wrongful possession of the instrument.

possessed the blank-indorsed Note at the time it sought summary
judgment, a material question of fact exists as to whether Bank
of America possessed the Note, or was otherwise a holder, at the
time it brought the foreclosure action."  Id.  at 370, 390 P.3d at
1257.  
Here, Onewest did not attach the Note to its Complaint
and the Lewis Declaration fails to establish, or even mention,
that Onewest possessed the Note at the time it filed its
Complaint.4/  Rather, the Complaint merely stated that the
original mortgagee's (i.e., Indymac's) interest in the mortgage
was assigned to Onewest and that "[Onewest] is now in possession
of the Mortgage and Note."  Moreover, the copy of the Note that
is attached to the motion for summary judgment does not reflect
the date of the blank indorsement, and the Lewis Declaration,
which was signed more than three years after the filing of the
Complaint, simply states that "Plaintiff is in possession of an
original promissory note" and that "the Note is endorsed in
blank."  Similarly, Ocwen's counsel submitted a declaration dated
October 26, 2015, attesting that his staff received the original
Note from Ocwen on October 28, 2014, again long after the
Complaint was filed on April 26, 2012.  Accordingly, Ocwen may
have established that it possessed the Note at the time it sought
summary judgment, but it failed to establish that Onewest
possessed the Note at the time it filed the Complaint.  See
Reyes-Toledo , 139 Hawai# i at 370-71, 390 P.3d at 1257-58.
Viewing the facts and inferences in the light most
favorable to Appellants as we must, Salera v. Caldwell, 137
Hawai#i 409, 415, 375 P.3d 188, 194 (2016), there is a genuine
issue of material fact as to whether Onewest, as the original
foreclosing plaintiff, had standing under Reyes-Toledo  at the
time the foreclosure action was commenced.  See Ocwen Loan
Servicing, LLC v. Chelminiak, No. CAAP-17-0000083, 2018 WL
4/Although Ocwen submitted an "HRS ยง 667-17 Affirmation" with its
summary judgment motion, it appears that in  Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v.
Behrendt,  No. SCAP-16-0000645, 2018 WL 1325153 (Haw. Mar. 15, 2018), the
Hawai#i Supreme Court implicitly did not give any evidentiary credit to an
attorney affirmation in the record in that case.  See Wilmington Savings Fund
Soc. v. Yasuda , No. CAAP-17-0000433, 2018 WL 1904909 (Haw. Ct. App. Apr. 23,
2018) (Ginoza, J., concurring).

1531155, at *2 (Haw. Ct. App. March 29, 2018) (holding under
similar facts involving several of the same parties that summary
judgment was inappropriate).  Therefore, the Circuit Court erred
in granting summary judgment in favor of Ocwen. 
Given the foregoing, we need not address Appellants'
arguments relating to robo-signing and the business records
exception to hearsay. 
Therefore, we vacate the Order and Judgment, both
entered in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit on December 10,
2015, and remand this case for further proceedings.
