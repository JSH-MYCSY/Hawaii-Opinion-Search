notice of notice of payment of fees, indicating Appellant should
 pay the filing fees or request a fee waiver by January 22, 2016,
 or the appeal could be dismissed;
 
(3) On March 17, 2016, the appellate clerk notified
 
Appellant that the time to docket the record on appeal expired on

the record on appeal cannot be prepared without the fees or an
 
order authorizing Appellant to proceed on appeal in forma
 pauperis, the matter would be called to the court's attention on
 March 28, 2016, for action that may include dismissal, and
 Appellant may file a motion requesting relief from default;
 
(4) Appellant did not pay the filing fees, or take any
 
further action in this appeal; and
 
(5) An appeal may be dismissed where the record on 
appeal has not been prepared because the appellant failed to pay the required fees or obtain an order allowing the appellant to proceed in forma pauperis. Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure

Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed.
