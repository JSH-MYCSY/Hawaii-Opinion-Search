OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
IN THE INTEREST OF JE
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
(FC-J NO. 0103122)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Fujise, Presiding Judge and Ginoza, J.,
with Leonard, J., concurring and dissenting)
Minor-Appellant JE (JE) appeals from the December 14,
2015 Family Court of the Fifth Circuit's1 (Family Court) Decision
and Order Regarding Restitution Hearing (Order).  Pursuant to a
plea agreement, JE admitted the charge of Harassment in violation
of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 711-1106(1)(a) (2014),2
reduced from a charge of Assault in the Second Degree in
violation of HRS § 707-711(1)(d)(2014) (amended 2016)3.  JE was
sentenced to probation for eighteen months, and ordered to, inter
1The Honorable Edmund D. Acoba presided.
2HRS § 711-1106 provides, in relevant part, "(1) A person commits
the offense of harassment if, with intent to harass, annoy, or alarm any other
person, that person: (a) Strikes, shoves, kicks, or otherwise touches another
person in an offensive manner or subjects the other person to offensive
physical contact[.]"
3HRS § 707-711(1)(d) provides, in relevant parts, "(1) A person
commits the offense of assault in the second degree if . . . (d) The person
intentionally or knowingly causes bodily injury to another with a dangerous
instrument[.]"NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
alia, complete sixty hours of community service, and pay
$24,978.90 in restitution at a rate of $200.00 per month.4
On appeal, JE contends the Family Court abused its
discretion in ordering him to pay restitution to the complaining
witness.  After reviewing the record on appeal and the relevant
legal authorities, and giving due consideration to the issue
raised and the arguments advanced by the parties, we vacate the
Family Court's Order on different grounds.
JE was sentenced pursuant to HRS § 571-48(11) (2006)
which provides:  "The court may order any person adjudicated
pursuant to section 571-11(1) to make restitution of money or
services to any victim who suffers loss as a result of the
child's action, or to render community service[.]"  (Emphasis
added).  The plain language of the statute authorizes the Family
Court to impose either alternative.  State v. Wells , 78 Hawai #i
373, 376, 894 P.2d 70, 73 (1995) ("[The appellate court's]
foremost obligation is to ascertain and give effect to the
intention of the legislature, which is to be obtained primarily
from the language contained in the statute itself.  And where the
language of the statute is plain and unambiguous, [a court's]
only duty is to give effect to [the statute's] plain and obvious
meaning.") (citation, internal quotation marks, and brackets
omitted); see also State v. Demello , 136 Hawai #i 193, 213, 361
P.3d 420, 440 (2015) (under the rule of lenity a penal statute
must be strictly construed against the government and in favor of
the accused).  The rule of lenity will also be applied to
statutes dealing with juveniles, because it potentially involves
the same deprivation of liberty similar to adult criminal
statutes.  3 Norman J. Singer & J.D. Shambie Singer, Sutherland
Statutes & Statutory Construction § 59:1, at 154-55 (7th ed.
2008).  As quoted above, HRS § 571-48(11) authorized the Family
Court to impose restitution or  community service, but not both.
In its "Decree Re: Law Violation Petition(s)," the
Family Court imposed, amongst others, the following special term
of probation:  "1.  The minor shall complete 60 hour(s) of

community service via the Community Service Sentencing Program by
January 10, 2016 and comply with the conditions of the program."  
In its December 14, 2015 Decision and Order Regarding Restitution
Hearing, the Family Court subsequently ordered JE to pay
restitution as well.
The record reflects that JE completed his conditions of
probation, including community service.  However, because the
order of restitution was stayed pending this appeal, JE has not
yet paid the ordered restitution.  As HRS § 571-48(11) authorizes
the Family Court to exercise its discretion in deciding whether
to impose restitution or community service in a given case, and
because JE has already completed the ordered community service,
we cannot allow the restitution order to stand.
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the December 14,
2015 Family Court of the Fifth Circuit's Decision and Order
Regarding Restitution Hearing as to JE.
