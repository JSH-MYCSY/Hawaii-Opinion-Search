APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Philip E. Kozma (Kozma) appeals
 
from the December 22, 2015 Judgment entered by the Circuit Court
 
of the First Circuit (
Circuit Court).1
 
On appeal, Kozma primarily contends that Plaintiff-
Appellee Deutsche Bank National Trust Company as Indenture
 Trustee for American Home Mortgage Investment Trust 2006-1,
 Mortgage-Backed Notes, Series 2006-1 (Deutsche Bank), lacked
 
standing to foreclose on the subject mortgage and, therefore,
 
that the Circuit Court erred in entering summary judgment in
 favor of Deutsche Bank. 
The Hawai
'i Supreme Court recently reiterated: 
In order to prove entitlement to foreclose, the
foreclosing party must demonstrate that all conditions
precedent to foreclosure under the note and mortgage are
satisfied and that all steps required by statute have been
strictly complied with. See 55 Am. Jur. 2d Mortgages ยง 575
(Nov. 2016 Update). This typically requires the plaintiff to 
prove the existence of an agreement, the terms of the

agreement, a default by the mortgagor under the terms of the
agreement, and giving of the cancellation notice. See Bank
of Honolulu, N.A. v. Anderson, 3 Haw. App. 545, 551, 654
P.2d 1370, 1375 (1982) (citing 55 Am. Jur. 2d Mortgages
ยง 554 (1971)). A foreclosing plaintiff must also prove its
entitlement to enforce the note and mortgage.

No. SCWC-15-0000005, slip op. at 11 (Feb. 28, 2017) (further
 
citations omitted).
 
In that case, the supreme court held, inter alia:
 
A foreclosing plaintiff's burden to prove entitlement
to enforce the note overlaps with the requirements of
standing in foreclosure actions as standing is concerned
with whether the parties have the right to bring suit. . . .
As standing relates to the invocation of the court's

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
jurisdiction, it is not surprising that standing must be
present at the commencement of the case. Accordingly, a
foreclosing plaintiff does not have standing to foreclose on
mortgaged property unless, [at the time the action was
commenced,] the plaintiff was entitled to enforce the note
that has been defaulted on.
 
Id., slip op. at 12-14 (citations, internal quotation marks, and
 
brackets omitted; format altered).
 
With respect to the foreclosure appeal before it, the
 
supreme court determined:
 
Although Bank of America produced evidence that it
possessed the blank-indorsed Note at the time it sought
summary judgment, a material question of fact exists as to
whether Bank of America possessed the Note, or was otherwise
a holder, at the time it brought the foreclosure action.
Indeed, the copy of the Note attached to the summary
judgment motion does not reflect the date of the blank
indorsement, and the Egan Declaration, which was made after
the filing of the complaint in this case, does not indicate
when the indorsement occurred. Further, there is no
additional evidence in the record regarding the date of the
indorsements or whether Bank of America possessed the Note
at the time of the filing of the complaint. Thus, there is
a material question of fact as to whether Bank of America
was the holder of the Note at the time the foreclosure
 proceedings were commenced, which in turn raises the issue
of whether Bank of America had standing to foreclose on the
Property at the time it brought the foreclosure action.
. . . [T]here is no evidence in the record, either
through the Note itself, the Egan Declaration, or the other
documents attached to the motion for summary judgment,
showing that the blank indorsement on the Note occurred
prior to the initiation of the suit. Consequently, there is
a genuine issue as to whether Bank of America was entitled
to foreclose when it commenced the proceeding. Thus,
viewing the facts and inferences in the light most favorable
to Homeowner, there is a genuine issue of material fact as
to whether Bank of America held the Note at the time it
 filed the complaint. Accordingly, Bank of America failed to
meet its burden of demonstrating that it was entitled to
judgment as a matter of law, and the circuit court erred in
granting Bank of America's motion for summary judgment. In
 light of this ruling, we need not address Homeowner's
arguments with respect to whether the Mortgage was validly
assigned to Bank of America. 
Id., slip op. at 19-22 (citation and footnotes omitted).
 
The dispositive issue in the case now before us is
 
indistinguishable from the above. Here, although Deutsche Bank
 
produced evidence at the time it filed the renewed summary
 judgment motion that it possessed the subject note, endorsed in

blank, the copy of the subject note attached to the motion does
 
not reflect the date of the blank endorsement, and the supporting
 declaration, which was made after the filing of the complaint,
 does not indicate when the endorsement occurred or whether
 Deutsche Bank possessed the note at the time of the filing of the
 complaint. 
Thus, viewing the facts and inferences in the light
 
most favorable to Kozma, there is a genuine issue of material
 fact as to whether Deutsche Bank held the subject note at the
 time it filed the complaint. Accordingly, Deutsche Bank failed
 to meet its burden of demonstrating that it was entitled to
 judgment as a matter of law, and the Circuit Court erred in
 granting Deutsche Bank's renewed motion for summary judgment. In
 light of this ruling, we need not address Kozma's other
 arguments. 
Accordingly, the Circuit Court's December 22, 2015
 
Judgment is vacated and this case is remanded to the Circuit
 Court for further proceedings.
