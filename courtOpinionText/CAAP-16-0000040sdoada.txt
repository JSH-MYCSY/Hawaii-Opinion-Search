APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 08-1-2619-12)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Reifurth, Presiding Judge, Ginoza and Chan, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Ute Sandoval ( Sandoval), appearing
pro se, appeals from the "Findings of Fact; Conclusions of Law;
Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment, and for
Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure Against All Parties" ( Order
Granting Foreclosure ), and the Judgment, entered on December 16,
2015, in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit ( circuit court).1 
The Order Granting Foreclosure and the Judgment were entered in
favor of Plaintiff-Appellee U.S. Bank, N.A., Successor Trustee to
LaSalle Bank National Association, on Behalf of the Holders of
Bear Stearns Asset Backed Securities I Trust 2006-AQ1, Asset-
Backed Certificates Series 2006-AQ1 (
U.S. Bank ).
1  The Honorable Bert I. Ayabe presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
The original plaintiff in this case was LaSalle Bank
National Association, as Trustee for Certificateholders of Bear
Stearns Asset Backed Securities I LLC, Asset-Backed Certificates, 
Series 2006-AQ1 (LaSalle Bank ).  LaSalle Bank filed the Complaint
to Foreclose Mortgage ( Complaint) in this case on December 18,
2008.  It appears that U.S. Bank became the successor trustee to
LaSalle Bank sometime while this case was pending before the
circuit court.
On appeal, Sandoval raises various issues which she
summarizes as: violation of "Fair Act Practice," abuse of
discretion, substantial evidence, arbitrary actions, and
contradictions/misconduct.  We discern from Sandoval's opening
brief that she challenges whether the proceedings in the circuit
court were properly conducted, why the homeowners' association
for the subject property was involved, and whether the correct
parties were involved, including U.S. Bank.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
well as the relevant legal authorities, we resolve Sandoval's
points of error as follows, and we vacate and remand.
In Bank of America, N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo , the Hawai #i
Supreme Court recently held in a judicial foreclosure action that
in order to establish a right to foreclose, the foreclosing
plaintiff must establish standing, or entitlement to enforce the
subject note, at the time the action was commenced.  139 Hawai #i
361, 367-70, 390 P.3d 1248, 1254-57 (2017).  The holding in
Reyes-Toledo is dispositive in this case.
Reyes-Toledo  states that a foreclosing plaintiff must
typically "prove the existence of an agreement, the terms of the
agreement, a default by the mortgagor under the terms of the
agreement, and giving of the cancellation notice."  Id. at 367,
390 P.3d at 1254 (citing Bank of Honolulu, N.A. v. Anderson , 3
Haw. App. 545, 551, 654 P.2d 1370, 1375 (1982)).  Furthermore,
"[a] foreclosing plaintiff must also prove its entitlement to
enforce the note and mortgage."  Id. (citations omitted).  The
supreme court then expressed that "[a] foreclosing plaintiff's
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
burden to prove entitlement to enforce the note overlaps with the
requirements of standing in foreclosure actions as 'standing is
concerned with whether the parties have the right to bring
suit.'"  Id. (brackets omitted) (quoting Mottl v. Miyahira , 96
Hawai#i 381, 388, 23 P.3d 716, 723 (2001)).  The supreme court
further stated that "[a]s standing relates to the invocation of
the court's jurisdiction, it is not surprising that standing must
be present at the commencement of the case."  Reyes-Toledo, 139
Hawai#i at 368, 390 P.3d at 1255 (citation omitted).  Thus, a
foreclosing plaintiff must establish entitlement to enforce the
note and standing to foreclose on the mortgaged property at the
commencement of the suit .  Id.
A grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo.  U.S.
Bank v. Mattos, 140 Hawai #i 26, 30, 398 P.3d 615, 619 (2017). 
Like the foreclosing bank in Reyes-Toledo, U.S. Bank was granted
a decree of foreclosure via a summary judgment ruling.  In
support of its summary judgment motion, U.S. Bank attached, inter
alia, two documents to demonstrate that it possessed the subject
Reduced Payment Adjustable Rate Note ( Note).  First, U.S. Bank
submitted the declaration of Debra Kenter (Kenter), a Document
Control Officer for U.S. Bank, executed on January 20, 2015.
Kenter attests, in relevant part, that "[U.S. Bank] is the
current holder of the Note.  The original promissory note is in
[U.S. Bank's] possession and located in a secure facility owned
by or accessible to [U.S. Bank] at 3815 S. West Temple, Salt Lake
City, Utah 84115." (Emphasis added.)  Attached as Exhibit "1" to
Kenter's declaration is the Note, which bears an endorsement in
blank by the President and the C.F.O. of Argent Mortgage Company,
LLC (Argent).  It appears from the record that Argent was the
lender for Sandoval and the original Note holder.
Similar to Reyes-Toledo , the evidence submitted in
support of summary judgment fails to demonstrate that the
original plaintiff, LaSalle Bank, was entitled to enforce the
Note at the time the action commenced.  Moreover, it does not
appear that there is any other evidence in the record to
establish LaSalle Bank's entitlement to enforce the Note when
LaSalle Bank commenced this action.  The Complaint simply alleges
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
that Sandoval "made, executed and delivered to Argent Mortgage
Company, LLC that certain [Note] dated July 10, 2006[.]"
(Emphasis added.)  A copy of the Note, without any endorsements,
is attached to the Complaint.  There is no verification or
evidence establishing that LaSalle Bank held the blank endorsed
Note at the time the Complaint was filed.
Viewing the facts and inferences in the light most
favorable to Sandoval, as we must for purposes of reviewing the
summary judgment ruling, there is a genuine issue of material
fact as to whether LaSalle Bank was entitled to enforce the
subject Note at the time this foreclosure action was commenced. 
In short, under Reyes-Toledo, U.S. Bank failed to meet its
initial burden to show that it was entitled to summary judgment. 
Therefore, the circuit court erred in granting U.S. Bank's motion
for summary judgment.  Reyes-Toledo , 139 Hawai #i at 370-71, 390
P.3d at 1257-58.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Findings of
Fact; Conclusions of Law; Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for
Summary Judgment, and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure
Against All Parties" and the Judgment, entered on December 16,
2015, in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit, are vacated. 
This case is remanded to the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
for further proceedings.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, November 22, 2017.
