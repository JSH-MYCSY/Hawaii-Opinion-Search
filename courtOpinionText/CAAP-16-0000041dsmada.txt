(3) Appellants failed to file a statement of
 
jurisdiction or opening brief, and on April 1, 2016, the
 
appellate clerk informed Appellants that the aforementioned
 deadlines had expired and the matter would be called to the
 court's attention on April 11, 2016 for such action as the court
 deemed proper, which may include dismissal of the appeal. The
 appellate clerk notified Appellants that they could move for
 relief from the defaults. 
(4) Thereafter, Appellants did not file the statement
 
of jurisdiction or opening brief or respond to the notice of
 default. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, May 13, 2016.
