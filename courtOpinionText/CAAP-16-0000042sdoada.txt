(HONOLULU DIVISION)
(CIVIL NO. 1RC13-1-4367) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Defendants-Appellants Young Jin An a.k.a. Young Ja Kim 
and Ambrosia-Spa Inc. (An) appeal from the December 3, 2015 Writ 
of Possession and Judgment for Possession entered against An and 
in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee Association of Apartment Owners of Century Center, Inc. (the AOAO) in the District Court of the 
First Circuit (District Court).

Court's November 27, 2015 Order, which granted the AOAO's Motion 
to Terminate the Stay Pending Appeal. 
An raises two points of error, contending that the 
District Court erred in: (1) entering a new Judgment and Writ of Possession on December 3, 2015, in violation of its limited jurisdiction during the pendency of an appeal challenging a prior judgment and writ; and (2) granting the AOAO's Non-Hearing Motion to Terminate the Stay Pending Appeal in violation of An's rights to Due Process and Equal Protection of Law."
2 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve An's points of error as follows: 
As a threshold matter, we note that the District Court 
issued an initial Judgment for Possession and Writ of Possession against An, both entered on February 4, 2014,
3 from which An 
appealed. During the pendency of that appeal, the District Court, on November 27, 2015, granted the AOAO's Motion to Terminate the Stay Pending Appeal and, on December 3, 2015, issued a second Judgment for Possession and Writ of Possession, which are the subject of this appeal. 
The Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) previously 
concluded, in a February 26, 2016 Memorandum Opinion (CAAP-14-

000431), that the District Court lacked subject matter 
jurisdiction over this case and therefore lacked jurisdiction to enter, inter alia, the February 4, 2014 Judgment for Possession and Writ of Possession. The ICA vacated the February 4, 2014 Judgment for Possession and Writ of Possession, as well as other orders of the District Court, and remanded the case to the District Court with instructions to dismiss this case for lack of jurisdiction. This court's Memorandum Opinion was affirmed by the Hawai# i Supreme Court in Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Century 
Ctr., Inc. v. An, 139 Hawai# i 278, 389 P.3d 115 (2016) (An I). 
For reasons that are unclear, the District Court has not yet entered an order dismissing this case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. 
In any case, as stated in the ICA's February 26, 2016 
Memorandum Opinion, as well as in the supreme court's Opinion in An I, the District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over this case. Accordingly, the District Court lacked jurisdiction to enter, inter alia, the December 3, 2015 Judgment for Possession and Writ of Possession. 
Therefore, we vacate the District Court's: (1) October 
12, 2015 Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiff [AOAO]'s Motion for Relief from the Order Granting Defendants' Motion to Set Supersedeas Bond; (2) November 27, 2015 Order; (3) December 3, 2015 Judgment for Possession; (4) December 3, 2015 Writ of Possession; and (5) December 24, 2015 Order Denying Defendants' Motion for Reconsideration and/or Orders Setting

Aside Judgment for Possession and Writ of Possession Filed

This case is remanded to the District Court with 
instructions to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction. Other points raised in this appeal are moot.

4 The dismissal of this appeal is without prejudice to any further
remedies the parties may seek in a separate action.

Judge Hilary Benson Gangnes held a status conference at which she indicated
that the case would be dismissed.
