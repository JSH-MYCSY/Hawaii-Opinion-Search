NO. CAAP-16-0000048
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
ESTHER EUI HYUN KIM, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
MARSHALL TAIBOK KIM, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-D NO. 14-1-1537)

 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Upon review of the records in CAAP-16-0000048, it
 
appears this court lacks appellate jurisdiction over the appeal. 
Defendant-Appellant Marshall Taibok Kim (Appellant) appeals from
 the (1) Decision and Order, filed on October 1, 2015 and (2)
 Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Defendant Marshall
 Taibok Kim's Motion to Amended and/or for Reconsideration, Filed
 October 12, 2015, filed on December 28, 2015, in the Family Court
 of the First Circuit. 
Neither of the two appealed orders qualifies as an
 
independently appealable final order or decree pursuant to Hawaii
 Revised Statutes (HRS) § 571-54, which provides that "[a]n
 interested party aggrieved by any order or decree of the court
 may appeal to the intermediate appellate court for review of
 questions of law and fact upon the same terms and conditions as
 in other cases in the circuit court[.]" (Emphasis added). In
 circuit court cases, aggrieved parties may appeal from "final
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
judgments, orders or decrees[.]" HRS § 641-1(a). Appellant
 
admits that Plaintiff-Appellee Esther Eui Hyun Kim's Complaint
 for Divorce, including the question of dissolving the marriage,
 is still pending. Therefore, there is no final judgment in this
 case. 
Although exceptions to the finality requirement exist 
under the doctrine in Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848) (the Forgay doctrine), the collateral order doctrine, and HRS § 641-1(b), neither of the two appealed orders satisfies the requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine, the collateral order doctrine, or HRS § 641-1(b). See Ciesla v. 
Reddish, 78 Hawai
'i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) (regarding 
the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai
'i 
319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding the three requirements for the collateral order doctrine); HRS § 641-1(b) (regarding the requirements for an appeal from an interlocutory order). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is
 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
