APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 12-1-1427)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, and Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
In this appeal arising out of a foreclosure action,
Defendants-Appellants Kelly Dean Miller and Lee Miller Lane
(collectively "Appellants") appeal from the December 31, 2015
Order Denying Defendants Kelly Dean Miller and Lee Miller Lane's
Rule 60(b) Motion Filed 07/17/2015 ("December 31, 2015 Post-
Judgment Order"), entered by the Circuit Court of the First
Circuit ("Circuit Court")1/ in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee
E*Trade Bank.  The December 31, 2015 Post-Judgment Order denied
the July 17, 2015 Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure ("HRCP") Rule
1/The Honorable Bert I. Ayabe presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
60(b) motion for relief from the order granting confirmation of
the foreclosure sale ("Rule 60(b) Motion"). The Rule 60(b) Motion
sought relief from the November 20, 2015 order granting E*Trade
Bank's Motion for Order Confirming Foreclosure Sale, Approving
Commissioner's Report, Allowance of Commissioner's Fees,
Attorney's Fees, Costs, and Directing Conveyance ("Foreclosure
Decree"), and the November 20, 2015 Judgment.
On appeal, Appellants contend that the Foreclsoure
Decree and Judgment are void and unenforceable under HRCP Rule
60(b)(4) and (6) because the Circuit Court lacked jurisdiction
over the case due to the fact that E*Trade Bank was a foreign
bank that was not in good standing with the State of Hawai# i at
the time that it filed its complaint.  Appellants assert that
"all proceedings [that E*Trade Bank] has maintained 'in any court
in this State' are void 'until it obtains a certificate of
authority.'"  Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve
Appellants' point of error as follows and affirm.
"[A] judgment is void only if the court that rendered
it lacked jurisdiction of either the subject matter or the
parties or otherwise acted in a manner inconsistent with due
process of law."   Cvitanovich-Dubie v. Dubie, 125 Hawai #i 128,
139, 254 P.3d 439, 450 (2011) (quoting In re Hana Ranch Co. , 3
Haw. App. 141, 146, 642 P.2d 938, 941 (1982)).  There are limits
on collaterally attacking subject matter jurisdiction: "[I]f a
court has the general power to adjudicate the issues in the class
of suits to which the case belongs then its interim orders and
final judgments, whether right or wrong, are not subject to
collateral attack, so far as jurisdiction over the subject matter
is concerned."  Dillingham Inv. Corp. v. Kunio Yokoyama Tr. , 8
Haw. App. 226, 233–34, 797 P.2d 1316, 1320 (1990) (quoting 7 J.
Moore & J. Lucas, Moore's Federal Practice ¶ 60.252, at 60-225
(2d ed. 1990)).

Here, there is no challenge based on personal
jurisdiction or on due process grounds.2/  Arguing that E*Trade
Bank lacks standing is not equivalent to challenging a court's
subject matter jurisdiction under HRCP Rule 60(b)(4).  See
Nationstar Mortg. LLC v. Akepa Properties LLC , Nos. CAAP-15-
0000407 and CAAP-15-0000727, 2017 WL 1401468 at *2–3 (Haw. Ct.
App. April 19, 2017).  Cf. Mortgage Elec. Registration Sys., Inc.
v. Wise, 130 Hawai# i 11, 17–18, 304 P.3d 1192, 1198–99 (2013)
(precluding borrowers from challenging the lender's nominee's
standing to bring foreclosure action).3/
Finally, even if we were to reach the merits of
Appellants' claim, E*Trade Bank was not "transacting business"
within the meaning of Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") section
414-431.  See Haw. Rev. Stat. § 414-431(b)(8) (2004) (providing
that "[t]he following activities, among others, do not constitute
transacting business within the meaning of [HRS section 414-
431(a)]: . . . (8) . . . enforcing mortgages and security
interests in property securing the debts"); LaSalle Bank Nat'l
Ass'n v. Roth , No. 30626, 2014 WL 1271055, at *3 (Hawai# i Ct.
App. March 28, 2014) ("While Chapter 414 requires a certificate
of good standing to 'transact business' in Hawai# i, conducting
mortgage-related activities or enforcing its rights under the
Note and Mortgage, do not constitute 'transacting business'
within the meaning of that chapter." (citing Haw. Rev. Stat. §§
414-431(b)(7) and (8) (2004))).  Moreover, "[i]t is
well-established that a foreign corporation which is not required
to register in Hawaii may nevertheless sue or be sued in the
State's courts."  Cowan v. First Ins. Co. of Hawaii , 61 Haw. 644,
2/Furthermore, "a party seeking relief under HRCP Rule 60(b)(6)
after the time for appeal has run 'must establish the existence of
"extraordinary circumstances" that prevented or rendered him unable to
prosecute an appeal.'" Citicorp Mortg., Inc. v. Bartolome , 94 Hawai #i 422,
436, 16 P.3d 827, 841 (App. 2000) (quoting Hana Ranch , 3 Haw. App at 147, 642
P.2d at 942).  Appellants make no effort that we can observe to establish such
circumstances, and thus we deem the contention waived.  Haw. R. App. P.
28(b)(7).
3/Raising these issues in a motion for relief improperly relitigates
the merits of the foreclosure proceedings, which is precluded by the doctrine
of res judicata. See Wise , 130 Hawai #i at 17–18, 304 P.3d at 1198–99; Bank of
New York Mellon v. R. Onaga, Inc. , 140 Hawai #i 358, 368, 400 P.3d 559, 569
(2017).
