APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 11-1-0410 K)

 
ORDER DISMISSING THE APPEAL
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Upon consideration of Peter T. Stone's (Counsel)
 
declaration in response to the February 5, 2016 order to show
 
cause, the papers in support, and the record, it appears that
 Counsel has not demonstrated good cause why the appeal should not
 be dismissed. A notice of appeal has not been filed and this
 court lacks appellate jurisdiction.
