NICOLE NAMORDI, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
KONA DIVISION
(CASE NO. 3DCW-15-0000651)
MEMORANDUM OPINION
(By:  Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Nicole Namordi (Namordi) appeals
from a Judgment and Notice of Entry of Judgment,1 entered in the
District Court of the Third Circuit, Kona Division (District
Court), on January 7, 2016.  The District Court convicted Namordi
of one count of Criminal Property Damage in the Third Degree, a
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 708-822(1)(b)
(2014).2
Namordi argues that the district court wrongly
convicted her after (1) erroneously admitting into evidence a
written SKG Auto Body estimate without a sufficient foundation,
(2) erring and violating her constitutional right to
confrontation by limiting the scope of her cross-examination of
Officer Christopher Jelsma (Officer Jelsma), (3) failing toNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2determine the voluntariness of her police statements, and
(4) based on insufficient evidence that the damage amount
exceeded $500 and she knowingly or intentionally created damage
exceeding $500.  Namordi also asserts that the court erred by
ordering her to pay $903 in restitution after erroneously denying
her request for a restitution hearing.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve Namordi's points of error as follows:
1 and 4.  The District Court erred in admitting the
written estimate from the auto body shop.  The District Court
ruled it would admit the written estimate only for the purpose
stated by the prosecution but when announcing its verdict, orally
found it had determined the damage amount based on complainant
Larry Morris's (Morris) testimony.  Evidence of the cost of
reasonable repairs is an appropriate means to establish damage
exceeding $500 as an element of third-degree criminal property
damage.  State v. Pardee , 86 Hawai #i 165, 170, 948 P.2d 586, 591
(App. 1997), citing HRS § 708-822(b).  However, in this case,
Morris's testimony regarding the damage amount, which was based
solely on the written estimate, was hearsay to which no exception
applied.  See Hawaii Rules of Evidence Rules 801 & 802.  Cf.
State v. Hernandez, 133 Hawai #i 252, 325 P.3d 664, No. CAAP-13-
0000972, 2014 WL 1778011 at *1 (App. May 5, 2014) (SDO)
(substantial evidence of damage amount in criminal-property-in-
the-third-degree case where not only complainant but owner-
operator of auto body shop testified regarding the estimated
repair cost, and the owner-operator testified to his experience
compiling and method for determining estimates in general). 
The prosecution has the burden to prove every element
of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.  HRS § 701–114 (2014). 
An element of criminal property damage in the third degree under
HRS § 708-822(1)(b) is that the damage amount exceeds $500. 
Without the written repair estimate, there was insufficient
evidence of the amount of damage and, thus, to convict Namordi of
criminal property damage in the third degree.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
HRS § 708-823 provides that "[a] person commits the offense of3
criminal property damage in the fourth degree if by means other than fire, the
person intentionally or knowingly damages the property of another without the
other's consent."
HRE Rule 609.1 provides,
Evidence of bias, interest, or motive.  (a) General rule. 
The credibility of a witness may be attacked by evidence of
bias, interest, or motive.
(b)  Extrinsic evidence of bias, interest, or motive. 
Extrinsic evidence of a witness' bias, interest, or motive
is not admissible unless, on cross-examination, the matter
is brought to the attention of the witness and the witness
is afforded an opportunity to explain or deny the matter.4
3However, the evidence was sufficient to convict Namordi
of Criminal Property Damage in the Fourth Degree, a violation of
HRS § 708-823 (2014).3  See HRS §§ 702-206 (2014) & 708-823
(2014); State v. Maxwell , 123 Hawai #i 300, 233 P.3d 720,
No. 29746, 2010 WL 2586926 at *1 (App. Jun. 29, 2010) (SDO). 
At trial, Morris stated that he had testified on behalf
of Namordi's husband in custody proceedings involving Namordi's
son, and Morris's relationship with Namordi was sometimes
negative.  Namordi's boyfriend, Lyn Marcello (Lyn) testified he
told police Namordi and Morris had "bad blood" between them, and
Namordi testified that she and Morris had been involved in
ongoing disputes with each other.  Namordi testified that Morris
knew Namordi's son was not allowed to be at his house.  Lyn 
testified that when Namordi saw her son at Morris's house, she
became upset and began yelling.  Morris testified that Namordi
picked up a white cue ball and flung it at Morris's truck,
striking it.  Morris testified that State's Exhibit 7, admitted
into evidence, depicted a dent caused by the cue ball's impact
with the truck.  Morris and Namordi both testified that after the
ball hit the truck, Namordi yelled at Morris.  Neighbor Mark
Berlanga also testified he heard Namordi yelling.
2. Namordi also argues that the District Court
erroneously limited the scope of her cross-examination of Officer
Jelsma, preventing her from establishing he had a bias, interest
or motive under HRE Rule 609.14 and thereby violating her
constitutional right to confront witnesses.  Namordi did not
argue to the District Court that this limitation on her cross-NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Namordi's offer of proof was as follows:
The offer of proof is that Ms. Namordi had actually been
involved in a civil suit the year prior to the incident. 
She had filed a lawsuit against the Hawaii Police Department
regarding specific art -- specific officers and excessive
use of force, your Honor.  And this lawsuit was, I believe .
. . And therefore, that's why counsel is asking whether or
not the witness is familiar with these officers, your Honor.5
Further, Namordi had the opportunity to examine Officer Jelsma on6
the substance of his testimony but did not.  Presumably, she would have had
Officer Jelsma's report and would have been able to question him if there was
any discrepancy between the report and his testimony.
§ 621-26  Confessions when admissible.  No confession
shall be received in evidence unless it is first made
to appear to the judge before whom the case is being
tried that the confession was in fact voluntarily7
made.
Officer Kari later testified that Namordi was "enthusiastic" about8
giving a statement.
4examination violated her right to confront and we decline to
consider it for the first time on appeal.
Namordi sought to question Officer Jelsma about whether
he was "familiar with" certain Hawai #i County police officers who
were sued for excessive force by Namordi a year before the
instant incident.  Namordi acknowledged that Officer Jelsma was
not a party to this lawsuit.  When asked for an offer of proof,5
counsel did not state that Officer Jelsma knew of the lawsuit
when he took Marcello's statement or whether he had formed an
opinion regarding the merits of Namordi's lawsuit, but only that
counsel wanted to ask whether Officer Jelsma is "familiar with
the officers."6  The District Court sustained the State's
relevancy objection to this line of questioning as being "too
remote," and based on this proffer, we agree. 
3.  Finally, Namordi argues that the District Court
admitted her police statement, without adequately determining
whether it was voluntary, in violation of HRS § 621-26 (1993).7 
The prosecution introduced at trial, through Officer John Kari,
(Officer Kari) an "advice-of-rights" form executed by Namordi in
the presence of Officer Kari, who took Namordi's statement.8  
Namordi testified at trial and was questioned about her
statement.  Thus, the evidence presented supported the District
Court's implicit finding that the statement was voluntarilyNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Consequently, the order of restitution is also vacated.  We note9
that upon remand, any restitution shall be imposed pursuant to HRS § 706-646
(2014).

Based on the foregoing, the Judgment and Notice of

case is remanded for a judgment convicting Namordi of Criminal
Property Damage in the Fourth Degree.
