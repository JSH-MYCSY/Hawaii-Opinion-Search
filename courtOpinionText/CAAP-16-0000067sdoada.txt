Registration and Licensing Division's Motion to Dismiss Complaint
 
Filed on April 17, 2015, which was entered on June 8, 2015 (Order
 
Dismissing Complaint Against County Defendants).
 
Yellen's Opening Brief does not properly state points 
of error in compliance with Hawai 'i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
(HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4), but it appears that he contends that the District Court erred in dismissing his Complaint based on his 
assertion that: (1) technical defects in service of process should not result in dismissal of the Complaint; and (2) the Complaint properly stated claims on which relief can be granted because (a) he has been issued driving citations and certain requirements for operating motor vehicles under Hawai
'i law and 
the Driver License Compact (Compact) are unconstitutional, and 
(b) the reading of Miranda rights are constitutionally required
 
before the issuance of traffic citations.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs

 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Yellen's contentions as follows:
 
(1) It is undisputed that, in this case, Yellen failed
 
to serve the State and County Defendants in the manner required
 by District Court Rules of Civil Procedure (DCRCP) Rules 4(d)(1),
 
4(d)(4), and 4(d)(5).
2 On appeal, Yellen appears to argue that 
2
 DCRCP Rule 4 provides, in relevant part:
 
(d) Same: Personal Service. The summons and complaint
shall be served together. The plaintiff shall furnish the
person making service with such copies as are necessary.
Service shall be made as follows:
 
(continued...)

the provisions of DCRCP 4 need not be satisfied because the 
defendants have been put on notice of the suit and were not prejudiced by the improper service. This argument is without merit. Under Hawai
'i law, 
it is service of process, not actual knowledge of the
commencement of the action which confers jurisdiction.
Otherwise a defendant could never object to the sufficiency
of service of process, since he must have knowledge of the
suit in order to make such objection. . . . The crux of the
matter is not whether [a] defendant has knowledge of the
action but whether it has been put to the defendant, in the
proper way, that he must appear and defend or be in default.

 Inc., 126 Hawai
'i 190, 198, 268 P.3d 443, 451 (App. 2011) (citing 
Tropic Builders, 48 Haw. at 319, 402 P.2d at 448) (holding that a
 defendant's knowledge of the suit did not cure deficient service
 of process).
 
2(...continued)
(1) Upon an individual other than an infant or an
incompetent person, (i) by delivering a copy of the summons
and of the complaint to that individual personally or in
case the individual cannot be found by leaving copies
thereof at the individual's dwelling house or usual place of
abode with some person of suitable age and discretion then
residing therein or (ii) by delivering a copy of the summons
and of the complaint to an agent authorized by appointment
or by law to receive service of process.
. . .
 (4) Upon the State by delivering a copy of the summons
and of the complaint to the attorney general of the State or
to the assistant attorney general or to any deputy attorney
general who has been appointed by the attorney general.
(5) Upon an officer or agency of the State by
delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint to the
attorney general of the State, or to the assistant attorney
general or to any deputy attorney general who has been
appointed by the attorney general, and also by delivering a
copy of the summons and of the complaint to such officer or
agency. If the agency is a corporation, its copies shall be
delivered as provided in paragraph (3) of this subdivision
of this rule.

(2) Even assuming, arguendo, that service was
 
effective, we conclude that the District Court did not err in
 
dismissing the Complaint.
 
(a) Yellen claims that his constitutional rights were 
violated by the requirements under Hawai 'i law to (1) obtain a 
driver's license, (2) have his vehicle safety inspected, and (3) pay fines assessed for parking tickets. These arguments are entirely without merit. See, e.g., Kernan v. Tanaka, 75 Haw. 1, 
22, 856 P.2d 1207, 1218 (1993); State v. French, 77 Hawai
'i 222, 
225, 231, 883 P.2d 644, 647, 653 (App. 1994). 
(b) Yellen also contends on appeal that he should have 
been read his Miranda rights before he received traffic citations. However, Yellen did not allege in the Complaint that he received traffic citations (although he referenced a parking ticket), nor does the record on appeal contain any allegation or assertion that Yellen's rights under Miranda were violated. We conclude that this issue was not raised before the District Court and therefore will not be considered in this appeal. See, e.g., 
Hill v. Inouye, 90 Hawai
'i 76, 82, 976 P.2d 390, 396 (1998). 
For these reasons, the District Court's January 11,
