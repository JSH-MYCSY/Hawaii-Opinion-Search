2  A&B Defendants 
appealed from the Order Granting Plaintiffs' MPSJ.  Maui County, State Defendants, and Plaintiffs filed cross-appeals.
I.  BACKGROUND 
A. Factual Background 
For over a century, A&B & EMI have diverted water from 
East Maui streams for use in sugar plantation operations. Effective July 1, 2000, DLNR issued four revocable month-to-month permits (Nos. S-7263, S-7264, S-7265, and S-7266) (the Revocable Permits) that gave A&B and EMI the "[r]ight, privilege, and authority for the development, diversion, and use of water" from four areas (Honomanû , Huelo, Ke# anae, and Nâhiku) (the License 
Areas) in East 
Maui.3  Each permit expressly stated that it was 
issued pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 171-58. 
On May 14, 2001, while the Revocable Permits were in 
effect, A&B and EMI applied for a thirty-year lease of the License Areas (Lease Application).  In the Lease Application, A&B and EMI also requested the "temporary continuation of the year-to-year revocable permit[s] for existing permittees (the Nahiku [Nâhiku] revocable permit to [A&B] and the Honomanu [Honomanû], 
Huelo and Keanae [Ke# anae] revocable permits to [EMI] for fiscal 
year 2001/2002) pending issuance of the 
lease."4 By letter dated 
2 A&B Defendants, State Defendants, and Maui County are collectively
referred to herein as Defendants. 
3 The Honoman û, Huelo, and K e#anae revocable permits were initially 
assigned to A&B and the N âhiku revocable permit was initially assigned to EMI. 
4 In its Lease Application, A&B requested that the assignment of the
License Areas in the interim permits be the opposite of that depicted in the
original Revocable Permits. BLNR subsequently explained that "the issuance of 
2           
            
         
           
           
          
      NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
May 23, 2001, Nâ Moku objected to the long-term disposition of 
water rights proposed in the Lease Application and requested a contested case hearing
5 pursuant to HRS chapter 91, which governs 
administrative hearings and procedures. 
The Lease Application was included as a discussion item 
on the agenda for BLNR's May 25, 2001 public meeting.  During that meeting, the administrator of DLNR's Land Division informed BLNR, with regards to the Lease Application, "that the long-term disposition process is subject to discussion, that there is going to be a[n HRS] Chapter 343 requirement, and that [A&B and EMI] will be required to prepare the necessary environmental documents."  After a representative from A&B requested that the Lease Application be approved, Deputy Attorney General Dawn Chang clarified that "the only matter before the Board for action [was] the issuance of the 4 interim revocable permits.  The long-term lease [was] listed on the agenda for discussion only and [could not] be acted on by the Board at [that] time."  After hearing various members of the public present testimony on the issue, BLNR deferred action on the agenda item and granted a holdover permit to A&B and EMI on a month-to-month basis, pending the results of Nâ Moku's contested case hearing (2001 Holdover Decision).
6 
The following year, in 2002, BLNR began the practice of 
reviewing in bulk the continuation of revocable permits 
[the Revocable Permits] for the four [License Areas] are alternated annually
between [A&B] and [EMI]" in order to address the one-year restriction on thedisposition of temporary water rights imposed by HRS § 171-58(c). 
5 According  to  the  parties'  statements  of  related  cases  to  this 
appeal,  Nâ  Moku's  contested  case  (DLNR  File  No.  01-05-MA)  remains  pending.   The 
parties  have  also  identified,  as  a  related  case,  Nâ  Moku  Aupuni  O  Ko#olau  Hui  v. 
Bd.  of  Land  &  Nat.  Res.,  Civ.  No.  14-1-0918-04,  Circuit  Court  of  the  First
Circuit,  State  of  Hawai #i  (the  Contested  Case  Appeal).   The  Contested  Case  Appeal
arose  from  Plaintiffs'  attempts  to  have  BLNR  reconvene  the  contested  case.   On 
December  22,  2014,  the  circuit  court  in  the  Contested  Case  Appeal  (the  Honorable
Rhonda  A.  Nishimura  presided),  ordered  BLNR  to  reconvene  the  contested  case
hearing  and  "address  and  resolve  issues  for  which  [BLNR]  has  sole  statutory  and
constitutional  responsibility  and  that  are  not  duplicative  of  the  issues  to  be
determined  by  the  Commission  on  Water  Resource  Management  (CWRM)  with  respect  to
Appellant  Nâ  Moku's  pending  petitions  to  amend  interim  instream  flow  standards
for  27  East  Maui  streams." 
6 In a submittal for the May 25, 2001 meeting, the Land Division
recommended that BLNR "authorize the issuance of separate water permits to [EMI]for the 'Honomanu [
Honoman û], Huelo, and Keanae [ Ke#anae ] License' areas and 
[A&B] for the 'Nahiku [ Nâhiku ] License' area[.]"

throughout the state on an annual basis.  The purpose of the 
annual review was for BLNR to "either approve or disapprove the continuation of existing revocable permits covering State lands on a month-to-month basis for another year with or without any changes in their existing rental rates."  The list of revocable permits subject to review was attached to a staff submittal, which included a recommendation for BLNR's disposition of the listed revocable permits.  On February 22, 2002, BLNR approved, as amended, the continuation of a list of revocable permits for an additional one-year period up to December 31, 2002.  The A&B and EMI Revocable Permits were originally included in the list
7 
but BLNR noted: "These permits are involved with the EMI Irrigation system that were holdover [sic] by prior action involving a contested case.  The Board removed these permits from the list." 
At a meeting on May 24, 2002, BLNR addressed the re-
issuance of interim revocable permits to A&B and EMI.
8  The 
meeting minutes indicate that the Revocable Permits were brought back for review by BLNR because of "questions raised about authority to holdover permits beyond a year."  Ultimately, BLNR again "deferred and granted a holdover of the existing revocable permits on a month-to-month basis pending the results of the contested case hearing" (2002 Holdover Decision).
9 
At a BLNR meeting on December 13, 2002, the staff 
submittal regarding the annual bulk review of temporary revocable permits noted that the A&B and EMI Revocable Permits "continue on a 'holdover' basis due to the ongoing contested case hearing." The list of permits subject to review for renewal did not include the A&B and EMI Revocable Permits.
 Over the following two years, BLNR continued to leave 
7 On the February 22, 2002 list, prior to BLNR's decision to remove
these permits from the list in their entirety, the Honoman û, Huelo, and Ke#an ae 
permits remained assigned to A&B and the N âhiku permit remained assigned to EMI. 
8 In its May 24, 2002 submittal, the Land Division recommended that
BLNR "authorize the issuance of separate water permits to [EMI] for the 'Nahiku
[Nâhiku ] License' area and [A&B] for the 'Honomanu [ H on oman û], Huelo, and Keanae 
[Ke#anae ] License' areas[.]"

referred to collectively as the Holdover Decision or Holdover Decisions.

        NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the Revocable Permits off the list of permits subject to review 
by BLNR.  Then, at a BLNR meeting on November 18, 2005, the A&B and EMI Revocable Permits were placed back on the list of permits subject to review.
10  The staff submittal did not include any 
explanation as to why the Revocable Permits had been placed back on the list. 
For each year since 2005, up to and including 2014, the 
A&B and EMI Revocable Permits were included on the list of permits subject to BLNR's annual review.
11  Each year that the 
Revocable Permits appeared on the list, BLNR collectively approved the continuation of all permits on the list on a month-to-month basis for a one-year period through the following December. 
B. Procedural Background 
The subject of this appeal is BLNR's approval of the 
continuation of the Revocable Permits in December 2014 (December 
2014 Decision).  Plaintiffs filed a complaint on April 10, 2015, and a First Amended Complaint (FAC) on April 20, 2015, in which Plaintiffs raised claims against State Defendants and A&B Defendants in relation to the December 2014 Decision.
12  The 
first count alleged that State Defendants violated HRS chapter 343 (2010 & Supp. 2014) by failing to either (1) declare that the renewal of the Revocable Permits were exempt from the preparation of an environmental assessment or (2) require A&B Defendants to prepare an environmental assessment.  Similarly, the second count alleged that A&B Defendants violated HRS chapter 343 by failing to prepare an environmental assessment.  Plaintiffs requested a declaratory judgment that: A&B Defendants and State Defendants violated HRS chapter 343; the renewal of the Revocable Permits may have a significant impact on the environment; the Revocable Permits are void, "provided that up to 8.4 mgd of water may still 
10 On the November 18, 2005 list, the Honoman û, Huelo, and Ke #anae 
permits were assigned to A&B and the Nâhiku  permit was assigned to EMI, the same
assig
nm
ents as originally reflected in the February 22, 2002 list. 
11 For each of these years, the Honoman û, Huelo, and Ke#ana e permits 
were assigned to A&B and the Nâhiku permit was assigned to EMI. 
12 Defendant Maui County was named as an interested party.

be diverted and delivered to [Maui County] for the public health, 
safety, and welfare of existing customers served by East Maui surface water diversions"; and State Defendants or A&B Defendants must complete an environmental assessment.  Plaintiffs also requested injunctions against A&B Defendants' continued diversion of water from the License Areas and State Defendants' issuance of permits authorizing use of the License Areas "until full compliance with HRS chapter 343 and approval of all necessary permits," except for the diversion and delivery of water to [Maui County] for the public health, safety, and welfare of existing customers. 
On October 21, 2015, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for 
Partial Summary Judgment (Plaintiffs' MPSJ), requesting declaratory relief that: A&B Defendants and State Defendants violated HRS chapter 343; the Revocable Permits are null and void; A&B Defendants have no legal or statutory authority to continue using the License Areas; and State Defendants have no legal or statutory basis to authorize A&B Defendants' continued use of the License Areas. 
On January 8, 2016, the circuit court entered its Order 
Granting Plaintiffs' MPSJ.  The Order Granting Plaintiffs' MPSJ stated, in relevant part: 
4.  At issue in this lawsuit is the decision of the 
BLNR at its December 12, 2014 meeting to renew, inter alia , 
the [Revocable Permits] for a one-year period[.] 
. . . . 
5.  The State Defendants, DWS, and the A&B Defendants
(collectively, "Defendants") argue that the decision of the
BLNR to "continue" the Revocable Permits in December 2014 on a holdover basis is not an "action" under HRS § 343-5. Defendants argue that no [environmental assessment (EA)] wasrequired.  The BLNR's December 2014 decision to continue the Revocable Permits does not constitute an "action" subject tothe EA requirements of Chapter 343. 
6.  Nevertheless, pursuant to HRS § 171-58(c), the
BLNR authorized A&B's use on a holdover basis.  This holdover status has continued uninterrupted for the last 13years.  HRS §§ 171-10
[]13 and 171-55 authorize the 
"temporary" occupation of public lands.  A&B's continuous 
13 The circuit court's reference to HRS § 171-10 (1993) appears to be a
typo as HRS § 171-10 defines classes of public lands and does not address any
"temporary" occupation of public lands. Rather, it appears the circuit courtintended to cite HRS § 171-40 (1993), which provides for "temporary" permits toextend expired leases. 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
uninterrupted use of these public lands on a holdover basis
for the last 13 years is not the "temporary" use that HRSChapter 171 envisions.  See also Black's Law Dictionary, 10th edition.  Otherwise, holdover tenants could arguably beallowed to occupy public lands almost in perpetuity forcontinuous, multiple one-year periods.  Such a prospect isinconsistent with the public interest and legislativeintent. 
7.  
Plaintiffs' Motion is GRANTED.  Revocable Permit 
Nos. 7263, 7264, 7265, and 7266 are invalid. 
On January 19, 2016, Maui County filed an application 
for leave to take interlocutory appeal of the Order Granting 
Plaintiffs' MPSJ, and motion for stay of proceedings or enforcement of the order pending appeal.  A&B Defendants and State Defendants filed joinders in Maui County's application to take interlocutory appeal.  On February 2, 2016, the circuit court denied A&B Defendants' motion for rehearing on the Order Granting Plaintiffs' MPSJ.  On February 5, 2016, the circuit court granted leave to Maui County, State Defendants, and A&B Defendants to take an interlocutory appeal of the Order Granting Plaintiffs' MPSJ. 
A&B Defendants filed a notice of appeal on February 5, 
2016.  State Defendants and Maui County filed their notices of cross-appeal on February 8, 2016.  Plaintiffs filed their notice of cross-appeal on February 16, 2016.
II.  POINTS OF ERROR 
On appeal, A&B Defendants contend that the circuit 
court erred by: (1) granting Plaintiffs' MPSJ on Plaintiffs' claim that Defendants violated HRS chapter 343 despite determining that the renewal of the Revocable Permits did not constitute an "action" subject to HRS chapter 343; (2) granting Plaintiffs' MPSJ even though genuine issues of material fact existed as to whether the December 2014 Decision constituted an "action" within the meaning of HRS chapter 343; (3) exceeding its jurisdiction in ruling on the legality of the Holdover Decisions under HRS chapter 171, which was not an issue raised in Plaintiffs' FAC; and (4) declaring that the Revocable Permits were invalid based on the circuit court's determination that the Holdover Decisions were not a legal exercise of authority under HRS chapter 171, without considering BLNR's authority under the public trust doctrine. 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In their respective cross-appeals, State Defendants and 
Maui County also argue that the circuit court erred in granting 
Plaintiffs' MPSJ on grounds that were not raised in Plaintiffs' FAC. 
In Plaintiffs' cross-appeal, Plaintiffs argue that the 
circuit court erred in concluding that BLNR's renewal of the Revocable Permits do not constitute an "action" subject to HRS chapter 343.  However, Plaintiffs' position is that the Order Granting Plaintiffs' MPSJ should be upheld, thus Plaintiffs only cross appeal in case this court vacates the Order Granting Plaintiffs' MPSJ. 
III.  STANDARD OF REVIEW 
A. Summary Judgment 
An appellate court reviews the circuit court's grant or 
denial of summary judgment de novo.  Querubin v. Thronas, 107 Hawai# i
 48, 56, 109 P.3d 689, 697 (2005).  The Hawai# i Supreme 
Court has often articulated that 
[s]ummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions onfile, together with the affidavits, if any, show that thereis no genuine issue as to any material fact and that themoving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  A fact is material if proof of that fact would have the effectof establishing or refuting one of the essential elements ofa cause of action or defense asserted by the parties.  The evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to thenon-moving party.  In other words, we must view all of theevidence and the inferences drawn therefrom in the lightmost favorable to the party opposing the motion. 
Id. (quoting Durette v. Aloha Plastic Recycling, Inc., 105 
Hawai# i 490, 501, 100 P.3d 60, 71 (2004)). 
B. Statutory Interpretation 
Statutory interpretation is "a question of law
reviewable de novo ."  State v. Levi, 102 Hawai #i 282, 285,
75 P.3d 1173, 1176 (2003) (quoting State v. Arceo, 84
Hawai #i 1, 10, 928 P.2d 843, 852 (1996)).  This court's 
statutory construction is guided by established rules: 
First, the fundamental starting point forstatutory interpretation is the language of thestatute itself.  Second, where the statutorylanguage is plain and unambiguous, our sole dutyis to give effect to its plain and obviousmeaning.  Third, implicit in the task ofstatutory construction is our foremostobligation to ascertain and give effect to theintention of the legislature, which is to beobtained primarily from the language containedin the statute itself.  Fourth, when there isdoubt, doubleness of meaning, or 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
indistinctiveness or uncertainty of an
expression used in a statute, an ambiguityexists. 
Peterson v. Hawaii Elec. Light Co., Inc., 85 Hawai #i 322,
327–28, 944 P.2d 1265, 1270–71 (1997), superseded on othergrounds by HRS § 269–15.5 (Supp. 1999) (block quotationformat, brackets, citations, and quotation marks omitted). 
When there is ambiguity in a statute, "the meaning of
the ambiguous words may be sought by examining the context,with which the ambiguous words, phrases, and sentences maybe compared, in order to ascertain their true meaning."  Id. (quoting HRS § 1–15(1) (1993)).  Moreover, the courts mayresort to extrinsic aids in determining legislative intent,such as legislative history, or the reason and spirit of thelaw.  See HRS § 1–15(2) (1993). 
Citizens Against Reckless Dev. v. Zoning Bd. of Appeals of City 
and Cty. of Honolulu, 114 Hawai# i 184, 193-94, 159 P.3d 143, 152-
53 (2007). 
IV.  DISCUSSION 
We first address whether the circuit court erred in 
granting Plaintiffs' MPSJ despite expressly ruling that the renewal of the Revocable Permits did not constitute an "action" subject to the requirements of HRS chapter 343.  Instead of denying Plaintiffs' MPSJ upon concluding that the December 2014 Decision was not an "action" subject to HRS chapter 343 requirements, the circuit court concluded that: (1) BLNR's continuance of the Revocable Permits in December 2014 was done on a holdover basis under authority granted by HRS chapter 171; and (2) the continuance of the holdover status was inconsistent with the public interest or legislative intent inasmuch as the holdover was not "temporary" as envisioned under HRS chapter 171. The circuit court granted Plaintiffs' MPSJ on the basis of HRS chapter 171 and declared the Revocable Permits to be invalid. 
Defendants argue that the circuit court erred in 
granting Plaintiffs' MPSJ on this basis, as Plaintiffs did not plead a claim under HRS chapter 171 in their FAC or Plaintiffs' MPSJ.  A&B Defendants cite to several cases out of our jurisdiction in support of their contention that the circuit court erred in granting Plaintiffs' MPSJ on grounds that were not raised in Plaintiffs' FAC.  The cited cases stand for the proposition that a judgment by a court is limited to the relief sought in the complaint, so that adequate notice of the claims is 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
provided against the defendant.  See, e.g., White v. Mazda Motor 
of Am., Inc., 99 A.3d 1079, 1088 (Conn. 2014); Rosenfeld v. Boniske, 445 S.W.3d 81, 89 (Mo. Ct. App. 2014); Medve Group v. Sombright, 163 S.W.3d 453, 456 (Mo. Ct. App. 2005); Holden v. Holden, 456 S.W.3d 642, 650 (Tex. App. 2015); Wetlands Am. Trust, Inc. v. White Cloud Nine Ventures, L.P., 782 S.E.2d 131, 143 (Va. 2016). 
We acknowledge that the notice pleading standard is 
also well-settled law in Hawai# i.  See Bank of America, N.A. v.
Reyes-Toledo, 143 Hawai# i 249, 263, 428 P.3d 761, 775 (2018) 
(clarifying and reaffirming that the well-established notice pleading standard governs in 
Hawai# i); Laeroc Waikiki Parkside, 
LLC v. K.S.K. (Oahu) Ltd. P'ship, 115 Hawai# i 201, 215 n.17, 166 
P.3d 961, 975 n.17 (2007) ("Hawaii's rules of notice pleading require only that a complaint set forth a short and plain statement of the claim that provides defendant with fair notice of what the plaintiff's claim is and the grounds upon which the claim rests[.]" (Internal citations, quotation marks and brackets omitted)). 
Additionally, "[w]hen issues not raised by the 
pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings."  Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 
15(b) (2012).  The doctrine of trial by consent, established in Hawai# i by HRCP Rule 15(b), is also referenced in some of the 
cases that A&B Defendants cite to in their opening brief.  See Medve, 163 S.W.3d at 457 ("[The Missouri Rules of Civil Procedure] allow[] a party to amend the pleadings to conform to the evidence at trial if an issue not raised by the pleadings is tried by the parties' express or implied consent"); Holden, 456 S.W.3d at 651 ("An issue is tried by consent when both parties present evidence on an issue and the issue is developed during trial without objection."). 
In this case, we note that HRS chapter 171 was not 
expressly pleaded as a basis upon which Plaintiffs' claims relied.  However, this does not necessarily establish that it was not raised to and tried by the circuit court.  The record 
10    
       
             
            
           
                 
            
            
    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
reflects that A&B Defendants argued in their memorandum in 
opposition to Plaintiffs' MPSJ that the "authority to use the [L]icense [A]reas derives from the Revocable Permits that were put into holdover status by virtue of the Holdover Decision of May 24, 2002."  Similarly, State Defendants argued that the Revocable Permits were put into holdover status in 2001 and 2002, and that the status has not changed since.  In other words, A&B Defendants and State Defendants argued that A&B Defendants' authority to use the License Areas and the ongoing validity of the Revocable Permits did not come from the December 2014 Decision, but instead derived from a continuance of the holdover status.  It was in response to this defense that Plaintiffs asserted that the validity of the holdover status had expired after a year, pursuant to HRS chapter 171.
14  Thus, although the 
validity of the holdover status under HRS chapter 171 was not raised in Plaintiffs' FAC or Plaintiffs' MPSJ, the issue was still tried by implied consent and we construe the issue as if it had been raised in the pleadings. 
We find no merit in Defendants' arguments that they 
were not on notice of any claim that the continuation of the holdover status of the Revocable Permits was in violation of HRS chapter 171.  As noted, Defendants themselves raised the issue of whether the continued validity of the Revocable Permits derived from the holdover status established by the 2001 and 2002 Holdover Decisions.  In doing so, Defendants had the opportunity to raise their arguments regarding HRS chapter 171, and in fact did so.
15  Given this fact, Defendants cannot now maintain that 
14 Plaintiffs  clarified,  at  multiple  instances  throughout  the  hearing
on  their  MPSJ,  that  the  purpose  of  the  instant  action  was  not  to  litigate  the
validity  of  the  Holdover  Decisions  themselves.   Rather,  Plaintiffs  asserted  that
Defendants  could  not  rely  on  the  continued  validity  of  the  holdover  status
arising  from  the  original  Holdover  Decisions  in  2001  and  2002  because  "the
holdover,  even  if  valid  for  a  time,  had  a  termination  date  dictated  by  the  plain
terms  of  the  statute  governing  holdovers  [(HRS  chapter  171)]  and  conferring  the
BLNR  with  the  authority  to  dispose  of  public  lands  and  resources  in  that  manner." 
15 The parties presented their arguments on this issue at the hearing
on Plaintiffs' MPSJ, held on November 24, 2015. Notably, at the hearing, A&B
Defendants pointed out that the issue of the continued validity of the holdoverstatus was "absolutely [at issue] because what [Plaintiffs are] asking the Courtto do is to make a ruling that . . . there's no current authority for the A&BDefendants to continue using the licensed lands" and that "the issue of whether[the Holdover Decision] still has vitality is of course in play in thisproceeding . . . ."

there was a lack of notice or a lack of opportunity to refute 
their own legal argument. 
We conclude that Defendants had sufficient notice and 
indeed tried the issue of the ongoing validity, under HRS chapter 171, of the holdover status of the Revocable Permits. Accordingly, we conclude that the circuit court did not err in relying on HRS chapter 171 as a basis for its decision to grant Plaintiffs' MPSJ. 
We next address whether the circuit court erred in 
ruling as a matter of law that the continuation of the holdover status of the Revocable Permits was in violation of HRS chapter 171.  The Revocable Permits expressly stated that they were issued pursuant to HRS § 171-58, which governs BLNR's authority to make dispositions of water rights.  At the time the Revocable Permits were issued, HRS § 171-58 (1993) provided, in relevant part: 
(c) Disposition of water rights may be made by . . .
permit for temporary use on a month-to-month basis under
those conditions which will best serve the interests of the State and subject to a maximum term of one year and otherrestrictions under the law[.] 
(Emphasis added.)  Thus, under HRS § 171-58(c), BLNR had no 
authority to extend the Revocable Permits past the first year, ending on July 1, 2001.  Accordingly, we must determine what authority, if any, BLNR acted under when it placed the Revocable Permits in holdover status and thereafter continued to maintain them in holdover status. 
"The provisions of Chapter 171, Hawaii Revised Statutes 
governs the management and disposition of public lands by [DLNR] and [BLNR], and circumscribes, in detail, the disposition of such lands."  Big Island Small Ranchers Ass'n v. State, 60 Haw. 228, 237, 588 P.2d 430, 436 (1978).  "The provision for disposition only of single specific uses [(e.g. water)] was incorporated so that the State may benefit from a widely diversified utilization of its land."  Id. at 237, 588 P.2d at 437 (quoting SCR No. 240, H.B. 244 (1962)). 
When BLNR first placed the Revocable Permits in 
holdover status at the May 25, 2001 meeting, HRS § 171-55 (1993) provided: 
12         
             
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the board of
land and natural resources may issue permits for thetemporary occupancy of state lands or an interest therein ona month-to-month basis by direct negotiation without publicauction, under conditions and rent which will serve the bestinterests of the State, subject, however, to thoserestrictions as may from time to time be expressly imposedby the board.  A permit on a month-to-month basis maycontinue for a period not to exceed one year from the dateof its issuance; provided that the board may allow thepermit to continue on a month-to-month basis for additionalone year periods. 
(Emphases added.)   We conclude that HRS § 171-55 authorized 
BLNR to place the Revocable Permits in holdover status 
"notwithstanding any other law to the contrary"  (i.e. the 
"maximum term of one year" prescribed by HRS § 171-58).  However, HRS § 171-55 requires that the permit holder's occupancy be "temporary."  The record indicates that BLNR originally approved 1716
16 Plaintiffs' Answering Brief concedes that the legislative history of
Revised Laws of Hawaii (RLH) § 103A-52, the predecessor statute to HRS § 177-55,
explains that the legislature 
intended  tha t  a  permit  on  a  month  to  month  basis  shall  be  for
a  duration  of  one  year  unless  extended  by  the  board.   At  the 
end  of  each  year,  if  the  permit  on  a  month  to  month  basis  is
extended  for  another  year,  the  board  approval  must  be  had. 
H.  Stand.  Comm.  Rep.  No.  522,  in  1967  House  Journal,  at  670  (emphases  added). 
17 The  Hawai #i  S upreme  Court  discussed  the  phrase  "notwithstanding  any
other  law  to  the  contrary"  in  State  v.  Dannenberg,  74  Haw.  75,  837  P.2d  776
(1992).   That  case  involved  HRS  §  712-1200,  which  at  that  time  provided,  in
relevant  part: 
Notwithstanding  a ny  other  law  to  the  contrary,  a  person
convicted  of  committing  the  offense  of  prostitution  shall  be
sentenced  as  follows:  [for  the  first  offense,  a  fine  and  a
discretionary  prison  term  of  not  more  than  30  days;  for  a
subsequent  offense,  a  fine  and  a  prison  term  of  30  days
without  possibility  of  suspension  of  sentence  or  probation.] 
Id. at  79-80,  837  P.2d  at  778  (some  emphasis  omitted).   Dannenberg  was  a  mandamus 
proceeding  from  a  prosecution  for  prostitution.   In  that  case,  the  trial  court
had  granted  the  defendant's  motion  for  a  deferred  acceptance  of  no  contest  (DANC)
plea.   The  State  petitioned  for  a  writ  of  mandamus  to  enjoin  enforcement  of  the
DANC  order.   The  supreme  court  first  noted  that  a  trial  court  ordinarily  has
discretion,  under  HRS  chapter  853,  to  grant  or  deny  a  motion  for  a  DANC  plea.  
Id. at  79,  837  P.2d  at  778.   The  supreme  court  then  reaffirmed  its  decision  in
State  v.  Rice,  66  Haw.  101,  657  P.2d  1026  (1983),  that  the  phrase
"notwithstanding  any  other  law  to  the  contrary"  in  HRS  §  712-1200  had  the  effect
of  "taking  away  the  trial  court's  power  [under  HRS  chapter  853]  to  grant  deferred
acceptance  of  guilty  pleas  in  prostitution  cases."   Dannenberg,  74  Haw.  at  80,
837  P.2d  at  778  (original  brackets  omitted)  (quoting  Rice,  66  Haw.  at  102,  657
P.2d  at  1026).
In  response  to  Dannenberg,  the  1993  legislature  amended  HRS  §  712-
1200(4)  to  allow  for  the  acceptance  of  DANC  pleas  by  eliminating  the  phrase
"notwithstanding  any  other  law  to  the  contrary."   State  v.  Hamili,  87  Hawai #i 
102,  106  n.5,  952  P.2d  390,  394  n.5  (1998).   This  "indicates  that  the  legislature
is  aware  of  the  meaning  of  that  phrase  'notwithstanding  any  other  law  to  the
contrary,'  and  is  able  to  act  accordingly."   State  v.  Casugay-Badiang,  130 
Hawai #i  21,  36  n.4,  305  P.3d  437,  452  n.4  (2013)  (Recktenwald,  C.J.,  dissenting).

a holdover permit "on a month-to-month basis, pending the results 
of the [Nâ Moku] contested case hearing" on the Lease Application.  Plaintiffs contend, however, that by the time of the December 2014 Decision, BLNR's annual renewals of the Revocable Permits were in fact not "temporary" because BLNR's failure to resolve the contested case - which has now been pending for 18 years - means the holdover "lasts indefinitely" and "endures indefinitely and immunizes BLNR from having to ever comply with HRS chapter 343." 
In its Order Granting Plaintiffs' MPSJ, the circuit 
court held that 
A&B's continuous uninterrupted use of these public lands on
a holdover basis for the last 13 years is not the"temporary" use that HRS Chapter 171 envisions.  Otherwise,holdover tenants could arguably be allowed to occupy publiclands almost in perpetuity for continuous, multiple one-yearperiods.  Such a prospect is inconsistent with the publicinterest and legislative intent. 
(Citation omitted.)  Whether or not BLNR's December 2014 Decision 
to continue the holdover status of the Revocable Permits was "temporary" or de facto indefinite under the circumstances of this case presents a genuine issue of material fact that should not have been resolved by summary judgment. 
HRS § 171-55 also requires that the permit holder's 
occupancy be "under conditions and rent which will serve the best interests of the State."  The record contains some indication that the annual continuation of the holdover status serves the best interests of the State.  For example, Maui County contends that it uses some of the diverted water to supply "domestic and pastoral" water users located in upcountry Maui.
18  Plaintiffs, 
however, contend that A&B Defendants' continued diversion of water from East Maui streams is "causing significant harm to stream life and traditional cultural practices with the sanction of the BLNR."  Thus, whether or not BLNR's December 2014 Decision to continue the holdover status of the Revocable Permits "will serve the best interests of the State" also presents a genuine issue of material fact.  We therefore conclude that the circuit 
18 Plaintiffs concede that allowing the diversion and delivery of water
to Maui County is in the State's best interest by excepting this use from
Plaintiffs' request to invalidate the revocable permits.

court erred in resolving these issues under HRS § 171-55 by 
summary judgment. 
In light of this conclusion, we must now address 
Plaintiffs' cross-appeal and determine whether the circuit court erred in concluding as a matter of law that the December 2014 Decision did not constitute an "action" subject to the requirements
19 of HRS chapter 343. 
As discussed supra, HRS § 171-55 provided BLNR with the 
authority to place the Revocable Permits in holdover status "notwithstanding any other law to the contrary."  We conclude that just as this language served to nullify the maximum term of one year prescribed by HRS § 171-58, it also nullified HRS chapter 343 EA and EIS requirements for temporary permits issued under HRS § 171-55.  Further, we interpret the purpose behind HRS § 171-55 as allowing BLNR to issue a temporary permit in the interim while a permittee pursues a long-term lease, for which an environmental review process under HRS chapter 343 must be undertaken. 
We therefore conclude that the December 2014 Decision 
was not subject to the EA/EIS requirements of HRS chapter 343 and, although the circuit court gave different reasons for its ruling, the circuit court did not err in concluding that HRS chapter 343 was inapplicable to this matter.  See Reyes v.Kuboyama, 76 Hawai# i 137, 140, 870 P.2d 1281, 1284 (1994) 
("[W]here the circuit court's decision is correct, its conclusion will not be disturbed on the ground that it gave the wrong reason for its ruling."). 
19 HRS chapter 343 is commonly referred to as the Hawai #i Environmental 
Policy Act (HEPA). HEPA establishes "a system of environmental review which will
ensure that environmental concerns are given appropriate consideration indecision making along with economic and technical considerations." HRS § 343-1 (2010). HEPA requires projects that meet certain criteria to prepare an EA orenvironmental impact statement (EIS).
