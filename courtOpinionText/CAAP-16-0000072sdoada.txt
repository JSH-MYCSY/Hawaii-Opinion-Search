Defendant-Appellant Burrelle David Duvauchelle, Trustee

(Burrelle), appeals from the Amended Final Judgment (Amended
 
Final Judgment) entered by the Circuit Court of the Second
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Circuit (Circuit Court) on January 19, 2016.1 Burrelle also
 
challenges the Circuit Court's: (1) June 26, 2013 Order Granting
 
Plaintiff Zachary Fred Bailey's Motion for Order of Voluntary
 Dismissal with Prejudice of the First Claim for Relief, and the
 Third through Eighth Claims for Relief of Plaintiff's First
 Amended Complaint (2013 Dismissal Order); (2) May 14, 2014 Order
 
Denying Defendant's Motion to Vacate the Final Judgment Filed
 
July 16, 2013 and the June 26, 2013 Order Dismissing with
 Prejudice Plaintiff's Claims 1 and 3 through 8 of the First
 Amended Complaint, Filed April 3, 2014 (Order Denying First
 
Motion to Vacate); (3) October 2, 2014 Order Denying Defendant's
 Second Motion to Vacate the Final Judgment Filed July 16, 2013
 
and the June 26, 2013 Order Dismissing with Prejudice Plaintiff's
 Claims 1 and 3 through 8 of the First Amended Complaint, Filed
 August 20, 2014 (Order Denying Second Motion to Vacate); and (4)
 
November 10, 2015 Order Denying Defendant's Motion for Leave to
 
File a Proposed Counterclaim against Plaintiff (Order Denying
 
Motion for Leave).
 
In this appeal, Burrelle contends that the Circuit
 
Court erred in entering: (1) the 2013 Dismissal Order and a July
 
16, 2013 Final Judgment thereon (the 2013 Dismissal Judgment);
2
 
(2) the Order Denying First Motion to Vacate; (3) the Order

 The Honorable Rhonda I.L. Loo presided.

 The 2013 Dismissal Judgment was appealed by Burrelle, but this
court held that the 2013 Dismissal Judgment was not an appealable final
judgment because it did not expressly dismiss the remaining counts and, as a
consequence, Counts 1 and 3-8 were still pending along with the Third-Party
Complaint. See Bailey v. Duvauchelle
, CAAP-13-0002812, 2014 WL 169744, at *2
(Haw. App. Jan. 15, 2014) ( Bailey II ). This court dismissed the appeal for
lack of appellate jurisdiction. Id.

Denying the Second Motion to Vacate; (4) the Order Denying Motion
 
for Leave; and (5) the Amended Final Judgment.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised, as well as the
 relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Burrelle's
 contentions as follows:
 
The Amended Final Judgment concluded the action brought 
by Plaintiff-Appellee Zachary Fred Bailey (Bailey) against 
Burrelle and additional parties, in which Bailey sought to 
establish legal ownership of certain land located on the Island of Moloka' i in Maui County. The Amended Final Judgment dismissed 
Counts 1 and 3-8 of Bailey's Amended Complaint with prejudice. 
Previously, on October 25, 2010, the Circuit Court 
entered a judgment pursuant to the Hawai' i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) Rule 54(b),
3 entering judgment in favor of 
Bailey and against the Duvauchelles on Count 2 of the Amended 
3
 HRCP Rule 54(b) states:
 (b) Judgment Upon Multiple Claims or Involving Multiple
Parties.  When more than one claim for relief is presented
in an action, whether as a claim, counterclaim, cross-claim,
or third-party claim, or when multiple parties are involved,
the court may direct the entry of a final judgment as to one
or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties only
upon an express determination that there is no just reason
for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of
judgment. In the absence of such determination and
 direction, any order or other form of decision, however
designated, which adjudicates fewer than all the claims or
the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties
shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims or
parties, and the order or other form of decision is subject
to revision at any time before the entry of judgment
adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities
of all the parties.

Complaint, the claim for declaratory relief (2010 Judgment).4
 
The 2010 Judgment declared: (1) "Bailey is the rightful owner in
 
fee simple of Parcel 27 . . . including the flag pole portion;" 
(2) the Duvauchelles "do not own or have any legal or equitable
 right, title or interest to any portion of Parcel 27, including
 the flag pole portion by deed, devise, descent or adverse
 possession, including the flagpole portion;" and (3) "Bailey is
 entitled to immediate and exclusive use, right and possession of
 all of Parcel 27, including the flagpole portion." The Circuit
 Court indicated in the 2010 Judgment, pursuant to HRCP Rule
 54(b), that there was no just reason for delay in the entry of
 judgment with respect to Count 2, as it fully and finally
 resolved the question of title and ownership of Parcel 27,
 including the flag pole portion.
 
Burrelle appealed the 2010 Judgment to this court in
 
Bailey v. Duvauchelle, CAAP-10-0000172, 2012 WL 2505299 (Haw.
 App. June 29, 2012) (SDO) (Bailey I). In Bailey I, this court
 
affirmed the 2010 Judgment in all respects. 2012 WL 2505299, at
 
*1-*3. This court expressly found that the Circuit Court did not
 err in granting the declaratory relief requested in Count 2
 because Bailey demonstrated a substantial interest in the
 property and superior record title. Id. at *1. In addition,
 
this court held that the Duvauchelles failed to set forth a prima
 facie case for adverse possession and, therefore, the Circuit
 Court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of Bailey

on his claim that the Duvauchelles had not acquired title to the 
disputed property by adverse possession. Id. at *2. Burrelle 
did not seek certiorari review of Bailey I by the Hawai' i Supreme 
Court. 
Thereafter, Bailey sought to voluntarily dismiss his
 
remaining claims, and in 2015, Burrelle sought leave to file a
 counterclaim challenging the 2010 Judgment. The Circuit Court
 dismissed the remaining claims and denied leave to file
 counterclaim.
 
(1) Burrelle argues that the Circuit Court erred in
 
entering the Amended Final Judgment dismissing Bailey's remaining
 claims against him, Claims 1 and 3-8 of the Amended Petition,
 because Burrelle "was in the process of moving to vacate the
 [2010 Judgment] based on newly discovered evidence proving the
 judgment was void."
 
"A judgment is void only if the court that rendered it 
lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter, or of the parties, or if it acted in a manner inconsistent with due process of law." In re Genesys Data Techs., Inc., 95 Hawai' i 33, 38, 18 P.3d 895, 
900 (2001) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added); see also Bank of Hawaii v. Shinn, 120 Hawai' i 
1, 14-15, 200 P.3d 370, 383-84 (2008); 11 Charles Alan Wright and Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure Civil ยง 2862 (3d ed. 2008). In Genesys, the Hawai' i Supreme Court reiterated that 
"[i]n the sound interest of finality, the concept of void judgment must be narrowly restricted." Genesys, 95 Hawai' i at 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
38, 18 P.3d at 900 (quoting Dillingham Inv. Corp. v. Kunio
 
Yokoyama Tr., 8 Haw. App. 226, 233, 797 P.2d 1316, 1320 (1990)). 
Burrelle argues on appeal, as he did before the Circuit
 
Court in his First Motion to Vacate and in his Second Motion to
 Vacate, that he has newly discovered evidence, which includes an
 engineering report that purportedly shows that the survey used by
 Bailey as evidence supporting his declaratory judgment claim,
 resolved by the 2010 Judgment, was defective. Burrelle also
 submitted additional photographic evidence and affidavits from
 individuals associated with Parcel 27 in support of his claim
 that he, and not Bailey, is legally entitled to the flag pole
 portion of Parcel 27. 
However, Burrelle's "newly discovered evidence" does 
not render the 2010 Judgment void; it is unrelated to the Circuit Court's jurisdiction over the subject matter, jurisdiction over the parties, or whether Burrelle was afforded due process. See 
Genesys, 95 Hawai' i at 38, 18 P.3d at 900. This argument is 
without merit and does not constitute grounds for denial of Bailey's request to dismiss Bailey's remaining claims. Burrelle has presented no reason why the dismissal of Bailey's remaining claims against him would prejudice him, and we find none. We conclude that the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing with prejudice Bailey's remaining claims. 
(2) Burrelle argues that the Circuit Court erred in
 
denying his First Motion to Vacate and his Second Motion to
 Vacate (collectively, Motions to Vacate) because he "clearly
 
produced sufficient evidence twice proving the Bailey claimed
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
flag pole lot was not on and not over Defendant's land and never
 
was" and that "the Court committed a gross miscarriage of justice
 by quieting title to that lot or roadway to Plaintiff Bailey." 
HRCP Rule 60(b) governs the granting of relief from a
 
judgment for reasons other than clerical mistakes and provides,
 in relevant part:
 
(b) Mistakes; inadvertence; excusable neglect; newly
discovered evidence; fraud, etc . On motion and upon such
terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or a
party's legal representative from a final judgment, order,
or proceeding for the following reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly
discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in
time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b); (3) fraud (whether heretofore
denominated intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other misconduct of
an adverse party; (4) the judgment is void . . . . The motion shall be made
within a reasonable time, and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) not more than one
year after the judgment, order, or proceeding was entered or taken. 
The Motions to Vacate purportedly sought to vacate the
 
2013 Dismissal Judgment. However, it is apparent that Burrelle
 
actually seeks to attack the 2010 Judgment based on the purported
 newly discovered evidence discussed above. The 2010 Judgment,
 however, was not subject to a Rule 60(b) motion based on newly
 discovered evidence when the Motions to Vacate were filed because
 such motions must be brought within one year of the entry of
 judgment. See HRCP Rule 60(b). The First Motion to Vacate was
 
filed on April 3, 2014, and the Second Motion to Vacate was filed
 on August 20, 2014; thus, both motions were filed over three
 years after the entry of the 2010 Judgment on October 25, 2010. 
Therefore, we conclude that the Circuit Court did not abuse its
 discretion in denying the Motions to Vacate based on newly
 discovered evidence.
 
(3) Burrelle further argues that the Circuit Court's
 
entry of the Amended Final Judgment dismissing Bailey's remaining
 
7
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
claims "violated [his] constitutional right to due process, equal 
protection, and the right to a jury trial." The court cannot discern the nature of the claim he is making as Burrelle fails to explain what specific actions taken by the Circuit Court, or not taken by the court, violated his constitutional rights. Bare assertions that one's constitutional rights have been violated are insufficient and must be disregarded. See Kakinami v. 
Kakinami, 127 Hawai' i 126, 144 n.16, 276 P.3d 695, 713 n.16 
(2012) (citing In re Guardianship of Carlsmith, 113 Hawai' i 236, 
246, 151 P.3d 717, 727 (2007) (noting that this court may "disregard a particular contention if the appellant makes no discernible argument in support of that position") (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)). Accordingly, we reject Burrelle's contention that his constitutional rights were violated in this case. 
(4) Finally, Burrelle argues that the Circuit Court
 
erred in denying his Motion for Leave. Burrelle sought leave to
 file a counterclaim, whereby he would seek to establish that he
 had "acquired title by deed and adverse possession for over 20
 years" to the flag pole portion of Parcel 27. Burrelle sought to
 quiet title to the same property that Bailey sought to and did
 establish was his legal entitlement through the 2010 Judgment. 
Accordingly, Burrelle's proposed counterclaim was a
 
compulsory counterclaim. See HRCP Rule 13(a).
5 Thus, Burrelle
 
5
 HRCP Rule 13(a) states:
 (a) Compulsory Counterclaims.  A pleading shall state as a
counterclaim any claim which at the time of serving the
pleading the pleader has against any opposing party, if it
arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
was required to seek leave of court pursuant to HRCP 13(f). HRCP
 
Rule 13(f) states: "[w]hen a pleader fails to set up a
 counterclaim through oversight, inadvertence, or excusable
 neglect, or when justice requires, the pleader may by leave of
 court set up the counterclaim by amendment." The Circuit Court's
 denial of an HRCP Rule 13(f) motion is reviewed for abuse of
 discretion. See Marks v. Marks, 51 Haw. 548, 563-64, 465 P.2d
 
996, 1004 (1970). As the Circuit Court already considered the
 merits of Burrelle's claim to title prior to and in conjunction
 with the entry of the 2010 Judgment, and we previously affirmed
 the 2010 Judgment, we conclude that the Circuit Court did not
 abuse its discretion in rejecting Burrelle's request to file a
 counterclaim in an attempt to re-litigate the matter.
 
subject matter of the opposing party's claim and does not
require for its adjudication the presence of third parties
of whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction. But the
 pleader need not state the claim if (1) at the time the
action was commenced the claim was the subject of another
pending action or (2) the opposing party brought suit upon
the claim by attachment or other process by which the court
did not acquire jurisdiction to render a personal judgment
on that claim, and the pleader is not stating any
counterclaim under this Rule 13.
