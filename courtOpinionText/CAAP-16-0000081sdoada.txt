 Defendant-Appellant Ronald Cawthon (Cawthon) appeals

 
from the Judgment and Notice of Entry of Judgment, filed on

Cawthon was convicted of Driving Without Valid Driver
 
License, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 286­102(b) (Supp. 2015) and No Motor Vehicle Insurance, in violation

Kingdom of Hawai 'i and the State of Hawai 'i operate in the 
Hawaiian Islands, and his nationality is in the Hawaiian Kingdom, 
therefore, he is not subject to the governance of the State of Hawai
'i. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Cawthon's point of error as follows and affirm.
 
The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has held that "'whatever may 
be said regarding the lawfulness' of its origins, 'the State of Hawai
'i is now, a lawful government.' Individuals claiming to be 
citizens of the Kingdom and not of the State are not exempt from application of the State's laws." State v. Kaulia, 128 Hawai
'i 
479, 487, 291 P.3d 377, 385 (2013) (internal citation, brackets, and ellipses omitted) (quoting State of Fergerstrom, 106 Hawai

P.3d 225 (2004)). 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment and Notice of
 
Entry of Judgment, filed on January 14, 2016 in the District
 Court of the Third Circuit is affirmed.
