NO. CAAP-16-0000083
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
JAMES RANDALL AKIRA BUSCHE, JR., Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 15-1-0228K)

 
ORDER DISMISSING THE APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record in CAAP-16-0000083, it 
appears this court lacks appellate jurisdiction because the 
appeal was untimely. Plaintiff-Appellant State of Hawai 'i 
(State) appeals from the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting Defendant's Motion to Suppress Evidence, filed on December 9, 2015 and Order Denying State's Motion to Reconsider, filed on February 8, 2016 in Circuit Court of the Third Circuit. 
A notice of appeal must be filed within 30 days after 
entry of the judgment or order appealed from. Rule 4(b)(1) of the Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP). The State 
received an extension to file a Notice of Appeal, pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(b)(5). Under HRAP Rule 4(b)(5) the time to file a NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
notice of appeal may be extended up to 30 days. The State filed 
a Notice of Appeal on February 12, 2016, 65 days after entry to the December 9, 2015 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting Defendant's Motion to Suppress Evidence. 
"Under Rule 4(b) of HRAP, only a timely motion in
 
arrest of judgment or for a new trial is a tolling motion." 
State v. Brandimart, 68 Haw. 495, 497, 720 P.2d 1009, 1010
 (1986). A motion for reconsideration is not a tolling motion
 under HRAP Rule 4(b). Id. Thus, the appeal is untimely. HRAP
 
Rule 4(b).
 
"[C]ompliance with the requirement of the timely filing
 
of a notice of appeal is jurisdictional." Id. at 497, 720 P.2d
 
at 1010. "We must dismiss an appeal on our own motion if we lack
 jurisdiction." Id. Therefore, this court lacks appellate
 
jurisdiction over the appeal from the December 9, 2015 the
 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting
 Defendant's Motion to Suppress Evidence, as well as the 
February 8, 2016 Order Denying State's Motion to Reconsider. 
Id. at 496-97, 720 P.2d at 1009-10.
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is dismissed for
 
lack of appellate jurisdiction.
