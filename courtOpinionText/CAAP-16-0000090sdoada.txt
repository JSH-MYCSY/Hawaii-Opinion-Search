DESMOND J. LEWI, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P. NO. 15-1-0003 (CR. NO. 08-1-0483))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.,
with Nakamura, C.J., concurring and dissenting)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Desmond J. Lewi (Lewi) appeals
 
from the "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Denying
 
Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release
 Petitioner for Custody Filed August 14, 2015, Without a Hearing,"
 entered on January 27, 2016, in the Circuit Court of the Third
 Circuit (Circuit Court).
1
 
On appeal, Lewi contends (1) the Circuit Court erred by
 
denying his Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or
 to Release Petitioner for Custody (Petition) and held an
 evidentiary hearing on October 15, 2015 without him being
 present, (2) he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel,
 appellate counsel, and counsel representing him for the Petition
 (HRPP Rule 40 counsel), (3) the Hawaii Paroling Authority (HPA)
 acted arbitrarily and capriciously by determining that he was a
 Level III offender, and (4) his consecutive sentence was illegal.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
1
 The Honorable Glen S. Hara presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Lewi's points of error as follows:
 
(1) There is no evidence in the record that the
 
Circuit Court held a hearing on October 15, 2015, or at any other
 time after the filing of and before the denial of the Petition. 
Therefore, Lewi's claim that he was not present during a hearing
 related to the Petition is without merit.
 
(2)
 Lewi claims that he informed his trial counsel
 
that his consecutive sentence was illegal in 2011. Lewi also
 claims that his trial counsel misrepresented his plea deal
 regarding sentencing, thereby making his plea involuntary. Lewi
 states as examples of ineffective assistance of counsel were
 counsel's
 
ability to represent the defendant would suffer from
[d]efendant's inability to clear up false or wrong
information in [the] P.S.I. Report, provide legal advice or
to seek reassurance or discuss any last minute misgivings,
or if Petitioner did not understand certain aspects of the
[p]roceedings or that he was changing his mind. Moreover
 the right to counsel includes the right to confer with
counsel.
 
Lastly, Lewi claims that trial counsel was ineffective at
 
sentencing and for failing to appeal his minimum sentence issued
 on September 16, 2010.
 
As discussed below, Lewi's consecutive sentence was not
 
illegal. Therefore, trial counsel was not ineffective for
 failing to appeal his minimum sentence on that basis. 
Lewi argues his plea was involuntary because counsel 
misrepresented what sentence he would receive. However, he expressly eschews the remedy for an involuntary plea, i.e., withdrawal of the plea, and urges instead that the consecutive sentence was "illegally imposed" and presumably that the consecutive sentence should be removed by this court. However, this remedy is not available to Lewi on appeal. Barnett v. 
State, 91 Hawai
'i 20, 29, 979 P.2d 1046, 1055 (1999). 
The record reflects that Lewi's trial counsel made
 
"various corrections to the presentence report" and argued for
 probation and for concurrent sentencing. Lewi does not identify
 what other information in his pre-sentence report is false or
 inaccurate, or in what respect his counsel was ineffective at
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
sentencing. In any event, as discussed below, Lewi's claims
 
relating to his minimum sentencing hearing in September 2010 are
 moot.
 
Based on the foregoing, Lewi's claim regarding
 
ineffective assistance of trial counsel is without merit.
 
Lewi did not file a direct appeal from his conviction
 
and sentence. As we explain below, Lewi's consecutive sentence
 was not illegal and therefore it was not ineffective for his
 counsel not to file an appeal.
 
Lewi claims his HRPP Rule 40 counsel was ineffective
 
for refusing to "argue, communicate, object to the courts on
 behalf of Petitioner's Rule 40 claims. Counsel did not prepare
 HRPP Rule 40 Petition." Lewi filed his Petition on August 14,
 2015. Lewi did not request appointment of counsel until
 September 17, 2015. HRPP Rule 40 counsel was appointed on
 September 17, 2015. Therefore, HRPP Rule 40 counsel was not
 ineffective for failing to draft the Petition. On November 16,
 2015, HRPP Rule 40 counsel filed a Supplemental Memorandum to
 Rule 40 Petition which addressed Lewi's claim regarding his
 minimum sentence but did not reiterate his claim that his
 consecutive sentence was illegal. Lewi does not state what
 additional arguments counsel should have made or how counsel's
 communication, or lack thereof, affected the claims in his
 Petition. Therefore, HRPP Rule 40 counsel was not ineffective.
 
(3) Ordinarily,
 
matters not presented to the trial court may not be
considered by the appellate court on appeal. Where the
 equity of the situation dictates, we will use our discretion
to take judicial notice of matters of which courts may
properly take judicial notice but which are not part of the
record on appeal. It has been held that an appellate court
may, in its discretion, take judicial notice of the files or
records of a case on appeal.
 
Eli v. State, 63 Haw. 474, 478, 630 P.2d 113, 116 (1981)
 
(citations omitted).
 
The court takes judicial notice of the December 22,
 
2016 Notice and Order of Fixing Minimum Term(s) of Imprisonment
 for Lewi issued by the HPA (2016 Setting). Apparently, Lewi was
 provided another minimum sentencing hearing on November 29, 2016,
 which resulted in a new minimum sentence and offender
 
3
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
classification. In this 2016 Setting, Lewi was classified as a
 
Level III offender for the Manslaughter conviction but a Level II
 offender for Carrying or Possessing a Loaded Firearm on Highway
 and Ownership or Possession Prohibited. Lewi's minimum sentence
 was set at 16 years for Manslaughter, five years for Carrying or
 Possessing a Loaded Firearm on Highway, and three years for
 Ownership or Possession Prohibited. Therefore, claims regarding
 Lewi's minimum sentence on September 16, 2010 are moot.
 
(4) Citing State v. Van den Berg, 101 Hawai
'i 187, 65 
P.3d 134 (2003), State v. Christian, 88 Hawai 'i 407, 967 P.2d 239 
(1998), and State v. Jumila, 87 Hawai 'i 1, 950 P.2d 1201 (1989), 
Lewi claims that his consecutive sentence is illegal because he cannot be convicted of both a "weapons violation" and Manslaughter. 
In Jumila and Van den Berg the court held that a person 
convicted of Murder in the Second Degree could not also be convicted of violating HRS §§ 134-6(a). The court in Christian, relying upon the reasoning in Jumila, held that a person convicted of Murder in the Second Degree could not also be convicted of violating HRS § 134-51(b). However, Lewi's reliance on Jumila, Christian, and Van den Berg is misplaced. In State v. Brantley, 99 Hawai
'i 463, 470, 56 P.3d 1252, 1259 (2002), the 
court expressly overruled Jumila because of a legislative amendment made to the statute in 1993.
2 Under Brantley, a 
defendant may be convicted of Murder in the Second Degree as well as Carrying or Use of Firearm in the Commission of a Separate Felony, in violation of HRS § 134-6(a). Id. 
HRS §706-668.5 (2014) states
 
(1) If multiple terms of imprisonment are imposed on a
defendant, whether at the same time or at different times,
or if a term of imprisonment is imposed on a defendant who
is already subject to an unexpired term of imprisonment, the
terms may run concurrently or consecutively. Multiple terms
of imprisonment run concurrently unless the court orders or
the statute mandates that the terms run consecutively.
 
(Emphasis added.) Thus, the court was authorized to impose
 
consecutive sentences upon Lewi when he was convicted of three

 The court in Van den Berg applied the reasoning of Jumila to the 
case because it began before June 18, 1993, the effective date of the
amendment. Van den Berg, 101 Hawai' i at 191, 65 P.3d at 138.

felonies at the same time. Therefore, Lewi's consecutive
 
sentence was not illegal.
 
Therefore,

 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Findings of Fact,

 Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner for Custody
 Filed August 14, 2015, Without a Hearing," entered on January 27,
