APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

ORDER
 
(1)
 DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
AND

 
(2)
 ALL PENDING MOTIONS ARE DISMISSED AS MOOT
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
jurisdiction over this appeal that Defendant-Appellant Mario Kai
 
Kwon, pro se (Appellant Kwon) has asserted in Civil No. 08-1­
1105, the Honorable Bert I. Ayabe presiding, apparently from the
 
September 18, 2015 Judgment of Foreclosure, because Appellant
 Kwon's February 22, 2016 notice of appeal is untimely under
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Rule 4(a)(1) of the Hawai 'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 
as to the September 18, 2015 Judgment of Foreclosure. 
Although the September 18, 2015 Judgment of Foreclosure 
is an appealable final judgment pursuant to Hawaii Revised 
Statutes § 667-51(a) (Supp. 2015), HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) required Appellant Kwon to file his notice of appeal within thirty days after entry of the September 18, 2015 Judgment. 
Appellant Kwon 
did not timely file any post-judgment tolling motions that would have extended the time to file his notice of appeal under HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). Appellant did not file his February 22, 2016 notice of appeal in a timely manner within thirty days after entry of the September 18, 2015 Judgment of Foreclosure, and, thus, Kwon's February 22, 2016 notice of appeal is untimely under HRAP Rule 4(a)(1). The failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise of judicial discretion. 
Bacon v. Karlin
, 68 Haw. 648, 
650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or justice is authorized to change the jurisdictional requirements contained in Rule 4 of these rules."); HRAP Rule 26(e) ("The reviewing court for good cause shown may relieve a party from a default occasioned by any failure to comply with these rules, except the failure to give timely notice of appeal."). Therefore, we lack appellate jurisdiction. 
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court 
case number CAAP-16-0000094 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction, and all pending motions are dismissed as moot. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, June 21, 2016.
