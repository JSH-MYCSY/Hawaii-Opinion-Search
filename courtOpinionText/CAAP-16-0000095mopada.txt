IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
BRUCE RYAN NAKAMURA, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI#I, Defendant-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 13-1-2361)
MEMORANDUM OPINION
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Hiraoka, JJ.)
Self-represented Plaintiff-Appellant Bruce Ryan
Nakamura ( Nakamura) was a student at, and a part-time employee
of, Defendant-Appellee University of Hawai# i (UH).  He claims
that UH failed to stop another UH student from "attempting to
impose a relationship on" him by subjecting him to "unwanted
advances or unwanted flirting."  Nakamura appeals from the
Judgment  in favor of UH entered by the Circuit Court of the First
Circuit (Circuit Court ) on September 18, 2015.  Nakamura
contends that the Circuit Court erred by granting UH's motion for
summary judgment, denying his motion for reconsideration, and
failing to allow him to file a second amended complaint.  For the
reasons explained below, we affirm the Judgment.1

I.
Nakamura's original complaint was filed on August 29,
2013.  Named as defendants were Honolulu Community College ( HCC)
and seven individuals who were alleged to be HCC employees.  Each
individual defendant moved to dismiss the complaint.  The Circuit
Court granted the motions to dismiss.  Nakamura filed two motions
for leave to amend his complaint (it appears that the second
motion was filed to correct errors in the proposed amended
complaint attached to the first motion).  The Circuit Court
granted leave to amend.2
Nakamura's amended complaint was filed on December 19,
2013.  It was sixty-six pages long and contained 214 numbered
paragraphs.  UH was the only named defendant.  The amended
complaint alleged that Nakamura worked part-time as a lab monitor
in UH's HCC computer lab.  A female student ( JC) was a regular
user of the computer lab.  Nakamura claimed that JC sexually
harassed him by pursuing him romantically in the HCC computer lab
and in the HCC parking lot.  Nakamura alleged that JC is mentally
ill, and that he "does not have an organic brain syndrome also
known as a mental illness."  He claimed to have written to an HCC
mental health specialist complaining about JC's behavior, "but
all six letters were totally ignored."  He claimed to have
written six more letters to an HCC vice-chancellor asking for
intervention, but the vice-chancellor "never confirmed talking
with [JC] about [Nakamura]'s complaints."
Nakamura claimed to have had a conference with three
HCC employees "to discuss the problem of [JC]'s unwanted
advances."  He claimed to have asked for recordings of HCC's
2We take judicial notice pursuant to Rule 201 of the Hawaii Rules
of Evidence (2016) that before filing the action below, Nakamura filed a
similar lawsuit in federal court.  By order entered on June 18, 2013, the
federal court dismissed the lawsuit with leave to amend, stating that "[i]f
[Nakamura] seeks to assert only state law claims against Defendants, this
court would likely lack jurisdiction, so he should consider filing such an
action in state court."  Order: (1) Granting Defendants' Motions to Dismiss,
Doc. Nos. 18, 20 & 22; and (2) Denying as Moot Plaintiff's Motion to Amend
Complaint, Doc. No. 35, Nakamura v. Honolulu Cmty. Coll., Civil No. 13-00054-
JMS-BMK, 2013 WL 3147266, at *7 (D. Haw. June 18, 2013).  It appears that
instead of filing an amended complaint in federal court, Nakamura chose to
file the action below in the circuit court.

parking lot security cameras, but was told there was no video
available.  After another alleged incident occurred off-campus
(on the street where JC allegedly lives), Nakamura claimed to
have written nine letters to an HCC vice-chancellor complaining
about JC's alleged behavior.  The vice-chancellor and an HCC
mental health specialist telephoned Nakamura and asked to see him
in person.  Nakamura asked them why.  They did not answer. 
Nakamura became upset.  The vice-chancellor cut off the call. 
The vice-chancellor then allegedly sent Nakamura a letter
"denying his complaint."  Nakamura claimed to have written "a
total of [sixty-seven] letters all over the place" complaining
about JC's alleged actions before "his patience ran out[.]"
Nakamura allegedly also reported JC's behavior to the
police but was told "that he had to give [JC] [a] warning that
she is bothering [him] before the police can get involved." 
Nakamura claimed to have randomly encountered JC on the HCC
campus mall and told her the "police told me to warn you that if
you continue to sit directly in front of me [in the computer
lab], the police will be called."  JC reported Nakamura to HCC,
and an HCC vice-chancellor sent Nakamura a letter "threatening
. . . in polite language that I will be kicked off all HCC
campuses if [JC] accuses me of harassment again."  Later, JC
allegedly attempted "to take revenge on [Nakamura] by again
falsely accusing him of harassing and/or following her, and
DEMANDING that he be kicked out from the [HCC] cafeteria or she
would report HCC to a higher authority."  (Capitalization in
original.)
Nakamura's amended complaint purports to state causes
of action for: (1) failure to stop prima facie sexual harassment;
(2) failure to stop harassment; (3)  failure to stop unwanted
advances; (4) gross negligence; (5)  dereliction of duty;
(6) deliberate indifference; and (7) failure to promote an
academic environment conducive to learning.  In addition to an
award of damages, the amended complaint seeks to have letters of
reprimand or censure sent to various HCC employees and to
transfer some of them to middle and elementary schools, and a
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
letter "to advise [JC] not to jump to negative conclusions if she
sees [Nakamura] on the HCC campus, its cafeteria, on [the street
where JC allegedly lives], which is a public street with public
sidewalks or the University of Hawaii campus or anywhere else." 
On March 3, 2015, UH filed a motion for summary
judgment ( MSJ).  An order granting UH's MSJ was entered on
August 12, 2015.  Nakamura moved for reconsideration.  An order
denying reconsideration was entered on December 8, 2015.  This
appeal followed.
II.
UH notes — accurately — that Nakamura's opening brief
fails to comply with Rule 28(b)(3), (4), and (7) of the Hawai#i
Rules of Appellate Procedure ( HRAP) (eff. 2015).  UH contends
that we should disregard Nakamura's points of error pursuant to
HRAP Rule 28(b)(4) and dismiss his appeal.  However, because
Nakamura is self-represented, and because it is our policy to
reach the merits of an appeal if possible, Housing Fin. & Dev.
Corp. v. Ferguson, 91 Hawai# i 81, 85–86, 979 P.2d 1107, 1111–12
(1999) (quoting Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai# i 225, 230,
909 P.2d 553, 558 (1995)), we will address Nakamura's arguments
to the extent we can ascertain them.  See also O'Connor v.
Diocese of Honolulu, 77 Hawai#i 383, 386, 885 P.2d 361, 364
(1994).
A.
Nakamura contends that the Circuit Court erred by
granting UH's MSJ.  We review a circuit court's grant of summary
judgment de novo using the same standard applied by the circuit
court.  Nozawa v. Operating Engineers Local Union No. 3, 142
Hawai#i 331, 338, 418 P.3d 1187, 1194 (2018).  Summary judgment
is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, answers to inter-
rogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits,
if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material
fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a
matter of law.  Id. at 342, 418 P.3d at 1198.  A fact is material
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
if proof of that fact would have the effect of establishing or
refuting one of the essential elements of a cause of action or
defense asserted by the parties.  Id.
Count I of Nakamura's amended complaint alleged sexual
harassment.  Sexual harassment is a form of discrimination
prohibited by Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 378-2
(Supp. 2012).   Nelson v. Univ. of 3Hawai#i, 97 Hawai#i 376, 387,
38 P.3d 95, 106 (2001).  There are two different forms of sexual
harassment: "quid pro quo" and "hostile environment."  Id.  "Quid
pro quo" cases involve allegations that an employer conditioned
employment benefits on sexual favors.  Id.  That situation is not
presented here.  "Hostile environment" sexual harassment (HESH )
is defined as:
Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and
other verbal or physical conduct or visual forms of
harassment of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment
when . . . [t]hat conduct has the purpose or effect of
unreasonably interfering with an individual's work
performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or
offensive working environment.
Id. (quoting Hawaii Administrative Rules § 12-46-109(a)(3)).  To
prove an HESH claim a claimant must show that:
(1)[they were] subjected to sexual advances, requests for
sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct or
visual forms of harassment of a sexual nature;
(2)the conduct was unwelcome;
(3)the conduct was severe or pervasive;
(4)the conduct had the purpose or effect  of either:
(a)unreasonably interfering with the claimant's
work performance, or
(b)creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive
work environment;
3HRS § 378-2 provides, in relevant part:
It shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice . . .
[b]ecause of . . . sex . . . [f]or any employer to refuse to
hire or employ or to bar or discharge from employment, or
otherwise to discriminate against any individual in
compensation or in the terms, conditions, or privileges of
employment[.]
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(5)the claimant actually perceived the conduct as having
such purpose or effect; and 
(6)the claimant's perception was objectively reasonable
to a person of the claimant's gender [identity] in the
same position as the claimant.
Id. at 390, 38 P.3d at 109 (reformatted).  Nakamura's opening
brief concedes that there are no facts supporting the "sexual
element" of his HESH claim, and states that he "has decided to
drop Count 1 Failure [sic] to stop prima facie sexual harass-
ment."  The Judgment is affirmed as to Count 1.
Counts 2 and 3 claim that UH failed to stop JC's
alleged "harassment" and "unwanted advances."  To the extent
those counts could be construed to plead sexual harassment,
summary judgment was appropriate because of Nakamura's concession
that there are no facts supporting the "sexual element" of an
HESH claim.  To the extent those counts could be construed to
allege some other tort claim, such as negligence, "[a] basic tort
principle is that breach of a legal duty is an essential element
of any cause of action[.]"  Fink v. Kasler Corp., 3 Haw. App.
270, 273, 649 P.2d 1173, 1175 (1982) (citations omitted).  The
general rule is that a person does not have a duty to act
affirmatively to protect another person from harm.  Lee v.
Corregedore, 83 Hawai#i 154, 159, 925 P.2d 324, 329 (1996). 
Exceptions to this general rule exist where there is a "special
relationship" between a "defendant and either the third person
who may threaten harm or the party who is the [potential] victim
of the harm[.]"  Knodle v. Waikiki Gateway Hotel, Inc., 69 Haw.
376, 386, 742 P.2d 377, 384 (1987).  "In determining whether such
a relationship exists, [the] court looks to section 314A of the
Restatement (Second) of Torts, which sets forth a non-exclusive
list of 'special relationships' upon which a court may find a
duty to protect."  Maguire v. Hilton Hotels Corp., 79 Hawai#i
110, 113, 899 P.2d 393, 396 (1995) (citations omitted).  The
Restatement (Second) of Torts § 314A (Am. Law Inst. 1965)
provides:
6NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(1)A common carrier is under a duty to its passengers to
take reasonable action
(a)to protect them against unreasonable risk of physical
harm, and
(b)to give them first aid after it knows or has
reason to know that they are ill or injured, and
to care for them until they can be cared for by
others.
(2)An innkeeper is under a similar duty to [the
innkeeper's] guests.
(3)A possessor of land who holds it open to the public is
under a similar duty to members of the public who enter in
response to [the possessor's] invitation.
(4)One who is required by law to take or who voluntarily
takes the custody of another under circumstances such as to
deprive the other of [their] normal opportunities for
protection is under a similar duty to the other.
In addition to that non-exclusive list, other special relation-
ships may exist because "[w]hether a person owes another a duty
reasonably to protect the other from foreseeable harm by a third
person depends upon whether the circumstances warrant the
imposition of such a duty."  Doe Parents No. 1 v. State, Dep't of
Educ., 100 Hawai#i 34, 71, 58 P.3d 545, 582 (2002).
As a defendant moving for summary judgment on claims
for which Nakamura had the burden of proof, UH had the burden of
either (1) presenting evidence negating an element of the
non-movant's claim, or (2) demonstrating that the nonmovant
will be unable to carry [their] burden of proof at trial. 
Where the movant attempts to meet [their] burden through the
latter means, [they] must show not only that the non-movant
has not placed proof in the record, but also that the
[non-]movant will be unable to offer proof at trial. 
Accordingly, in general, a summary judgment movant cannot
merely point to the non-moving party's lack of evidence to
support its initial burden of production if discovery has
not concluded.
Ralston v. Yim, 129 Hawai#i 46, 60-61, 292 P.3d 1276, 1290-91
(2013) (citations omitted).  UH submitted evidence showing that
it had a written policy on sexual harassment and related conduct,
and that its representative met with Nakamura and responded in
writing to his concerns.  UH representatives also interviewed JC,
witnesses identified by Nakamura, and the HCC computer lab
supervisor, and informed Nakamura in writing that they "found no
evidence of any wrong doing by [JC]" and that they "cannot
7NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
substantiate your claims that [JC] has engaged in improper
behavior, stalked you, or initiated contact with you either while
using the Computer Lab or anywhere else on HCC premises."  UH
informed Nakamura:
The evidence did not establish that [JC] did anything other
than sit in the computer lab as she is entitled to do.  The
interviews established that [JC] did not know you.  The
evidence failed to establish your claim that [JC] engaged in
behavior that constituted "stalking".  You were informed of
the conclusions of this investigation by letter dated
October 2011.
The uncontroverted facts of this case are that Nakamura
is an HCC student and a part-time HCC computer lab employee who
was 57 years old at the time in question.  He is not a child. 
Cf. Doe Parents No. 1, 100 Hawai# i at 74, 58 P.3d at 585 (holding
that state Department of Education, standing in loco parentis,
owed duty to take reasonable steps to prevent reasonably
foreseeable harm to elementary school students).  He did not
reside in a UH dormitory.  He has not shown by admissible
evidence that there was any special relationship between UH and
JC, or between UH and him, that could give rise to a legal duty
for UH to control JC, or for UH to protect him from JC's alleged
romantic advances.  The existence of a duty is entirely a
question of law.  Bidar v. Amfac, Inc., 66 Haw. 547, 552, 669
P.2d 154, 158 (1983).  To the extent Counts 2 or 3 could be
construed to allege some tort claim other than sexual harassment,
as a matter of law UH owed no legal duty to protect Nakamura from
JC's alleged acts or omissions.   The Judgment is affirmed as to
Counts 2 and 3, and also as to Count 4 which alleges gross
negligence.4
Count 5 alleges "dereliction of duty."  Count 6 alleges
"deliberate indifference."  Count 7 alleges "failure to promote
an academic environment conducive to learning."  Nakamura cites
4Our opinion is based upon the uncontested circumstances of this
case; it should not be construed to stand for the proposition that an
institute of higher education has no duty under any circumstances to respond
to claims of stalking or harassment made by any student.
8NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
no authority recognizing those causes of action or enumerating
the elements of a prima facie case.   His opening brief argues:5
The circuit court could have recognized Count 5 Dereliction
of duty as breech [sic] of duty; Count 6 Deliberate
indifference as intentional neglect, and considered Count 7
Failure to promote an academic environment conducive to
learning, as describing negligence for failing to stop the
[JC] problem of unwanted advances despite having adverse
impact on Plaintiff's studies.  Together with Count 2
Failure to stop harassment and Count 3 Failure to stop
unwanted advances, all these counts can be consolidated into
one count of negligence in an amended complaint.
As explained above, UH did not owe a tort duty to Nakamura under
the uncontroverted facts of this case.  The Judgment is affirmed
as to Counts 5, 6, and 7.
B.
"An order granting or denying a motion for reconsidera-
tion is reviewed for abuse of discretion; an abuse of discretion
occurs where the circuit court has clearly exceeded the bounds of
reason or has disregarded rules or principles of law or practice
to the substantial detriment of a party litigant."  Tax Appeal of
Subway Real Estate Corp. v. Dir. of Taxation, State of Hawai#i,
110 Hawai# i 25, 30, 129 P.3d 528, 533 (2006) (cleaned up)
(reformatted).  The purpose of a motion for reconsideration is to
allow a party to present new evidence or arguments that could not
have been presented during the earlier adjudicated motion; 
reconsideration is not a device to relitigate old matters or to
5"Dereliction of duty" appears to be "a uniquely military offense"
under Article 92(3) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C.
§ 892(3) that was "specifically intended by Congress to ensure the proper
performance of duty within the military service."  United States v. Blanks, 77
M.J. 239, 242 (C.A.A.F. 2018) (citing United States v. Lawson, 36 M.J. 415,
422 (C.A.A.F. 1993)).
"Deliberate indifference" is a legal standard applied in cases
brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violation of constitutional rights.  See
Reed v. City & Cty. of Honolulu, 76 Hawai #i 219, 229, 873 P.2d 98, 108 (1994).
"Failure to promote an academic environment conducive to learning"
appears to be a claim for "educational malpractice."  With one exception, the
states that have considered the claim have rejected it.  Ross v. Creighton
Univ., 957 F.2d 410, 414 n.2 (7th Cir. 1992) (citing cases).  Only Montana
recognizes such a claim, based on state statutes that place a duty of care on
educators.  Id. at 414 (citing B.M. v. State, 649 P.2d 425, 427-28 (Mont.
1982)).  We decline to recognize such a claim, for the reasons stated by the
Seventh Circuit in Ross, 957 F.2d at 414-15.
9NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
raise arguments or evidence that could and should have been
brought to the court's attention during the earlier motion. 
Sousaris v. Miller, 92 Hawai #i 505, 513, 993 P.2d 539, 547
(2000).  Nakamura's motion for reconsideration stated that it
presented "new arguments that he could not have presented prior
to or during the hearing [on UH's MSJ] because he did not know
how the Court would rule on the [MSJ] and the Court's reasoning." 
The exhibits attached to the motion could have been offered in
opposition to UH's MSJ.  Nakamura's affidavit attached to the
motion purported to authenticate the exhibits; it did not offer
any new facts.  The memorandum in support of the motion did not
cite to any change in the applicable law.  The Circuit Court did
not abuse its discretion in denying Nakamura's motion for
reconsideration.
C.
Nakamura did not file a motion for leave to amend his
amended complaint.  He contends that he made an oral request for
leave to amend during the hearing on UH's MSJ.6  His opening
brief states that his second amended complaint would have
"drop[ped] Count 1 Failure to Stop Prima Facie Sexual Harassment"
and consolidated Counts 2 through 7 "into one count of
negligence[.]"  The record on appeal does not contain an order by
the Circuit Court disposing of the alleged oral motion to amend.
If a motion for leave to amend had been properly made,
and if the Circuit Court had ruled on the motion, we would review
for abuse of discretion.  Office of Hawaiian Affairs v. State,
110 Hawai#i 338, 351, 133 P.3d 767, 780 (2006).  Where proposed
amendments to a complaint would not survive a motion to dismiss,
an appellate court should affirm the denial of leave to amend on
futility grounds.  Adams v. Dole Food Co., 132 Hawai# i 478, 488,
323 P.3d 122, 132 (App. 2014) (citing Office of Hawaiian Affairs,
6The record does not indicate that Nakamura requested a transcript
of the hearing as required by HRAP Rule 10(b) (eff. 2012); no transcript of
proceedings was filed by a court reporter through JEFS or JIMS as required by
HRAP Rule 10(b)(1)(G).  Nakamura attached what appears to be page 31 of a
transcript of some proceeding to his motion for reconsideration but no court
reporter certification was appended.
10NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
110 Hawai#i at 365, 133 P.3d at 794).  The amendments described
in Nakamura's opening brief would have been futile because, as we
explained above, UH did not owe a tort duty to Nakamura under the
uncontroverted facts of this case.  
III.
For the foregoing reasons, the Judgment in favor of UH
and against Nakamura entered by the Circuit Court of the First
Circuit on September 18, 2015, is affirmed.
