STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
JESSE W. JONES, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CR. NO. 12-1-0865) 
MEMORANDUM OPINION 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, and Reifurth and Chan, JJ.) 
These consolidated appeals arise out of Defendant-
Appellant Jesse W. Jones's conviction of sexual assault and 
kidnapping.  Jones was found guilty by a jury on two counts of Sexual Assault in the First Degree in violation of Hawaii Revised Statute ("HRS") section 707-730(1)(a) , one count of Sexual 
Assault in the Third Degree in violation of HRS section 707-732(1)(f) , and one count of Kidnapping in violation of HRS

Sexual assault in the third degree.  (1) A  person

section 707-720(1)(e)3/.  Jones was ordered to pay restitution 
and sentenced to prison for three twenty-year terms and one five-
year term, with the terms to run concurrently.  In appellate case number CAAP-16-0000096, Jones appeals from the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence; Notice of Entry entered on January 22, 2016 ("Judgment") by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit ("Circuit Court").  
Jones subsequently filed a motion for reconsideration 
of his sentence and for appointment of a three-member panel to evaluate his fitness.  The Circuit Court denied the motion and on July 26, 2016, entered the Order Denying Defendant Jesse W. Jones' Motion for Reconsideration of Sentence and for Appointment of Three Panel ("Order").   In appellate case number CAAP-16-
0000597, Jones appeals from the Order.  For the reasons explained below, we affirm the Order but vacate the Judgment and remand the case to the Circuit Court for further proceedings.

I. Background 
At trial, the complaining witness ("CW") testified that 
Jones approached her at approximately 4:00 a.m. on June 3, 2012, as she was walking to her hostel.  She agreed to meet Jones later that day for dinner and did not object to holding hands and kissing him prior to dinner.  At various times, the CW told Jones that she had to be back at her hostel by 10:30 p.m.  By the time Jones paid for dinner, it was almost 10:00 p.m. Instead of 
taking her home, Jones drove CW to Sandy Beach where he 
confronted her in a raised voice about medication she had taken at the restaurant.  CW testified that she was afraid and wanted

Haw. Rev. Stat. § 707-720(1)(e) (Supp. 2011). 
4/  The Honorable Dean E. Ochiai entered the Judgment and the Order. 
He presided, along with the Honorable Richard K. Perkins, over various pre-
trial proceedings.  The Honorable Michael D. Wilson presided over the jury trial.

to calm Jones down. 
According to the CW, Jones then touched her breast and 
sexually penetrated her with fingers twice.  The CW testified 
that she was in survival mode, which meant staying calm, listening to him, and performing various sexual acts.  This appeared to calm Jones down.  Jones offered her a white pill without indicating what it was.  She got scared, jumped out of the car and ran away while screaming for help. 
In his interview with Honolulu Police Department 
Detective Dru Akagi, a video of which was subsequently admitted into evidence at trial, Jones explained that after unsuccessfully attempting to restrain CW by pulling her back into the car, he drove off.  The CW's belongings, including a bag, passport and camera, remained in the car.  Jones further explained that, the CW asked if he wanted to have sex.  He admitted to touching her breasts and genital area but denied penetrating her with his fingers.  Later, he admitted that his finger "went inside a little."  He also said that CW offered to perform oral sex. 
II. Points Of Error 
On appeal, Jones contends that : (1) he was not fit to 
proceed or able to meaningfully participate in his own defense 
(a)
at trial or (b) at the motion for reconsideration of his 
sentence;  (2) it was plain error to admit Detective Akagi's 
testimony as to his opinion of Jones's guilt or innocence; (3) there was insufficient evidence for all the counts of sexual assault because Jones established that the CW had impliedly consented; and (4) it was plain error for the defense to stipulate Jones's statements concerning voluntariness into evidence. 5/
III. Standards Of Review

to understand the proceedings against him or her or,

Hawai #i [424,] 426 [n.1], 5 P.3d [414,] 416 [n.1 (2000)]
(emphasis added)(citation omitted).  Further, "inasmuch as atrial court's ruling on competency entails its assessment ofthe reports and testimony of the panel of examiners, as wellas its observational assessment of the defendant in court,its ruling is reviewable on appeal for an abuse of
discretion."  Id. (citing State v. Janto , 92 Hawai #i 19, 29,

within the discretion of the trial court, and only an abuse of that discretion can result in reversal."  State v. Tucker, 10 Haw. App. 73, 89, 861 P.2d 37, 46 (1993). 
Sufficiency of the Evidence 
We have long held that evidence adduced in the trial
court must be considered in the strongest light for the
prosecution when the appellate court passes on the legalsufficiency of such evidence to support a conviction. . . .The test on appeal is not whether guilt is establishedbeyond a reasonable doubt, but whether there was substantialevidence to support the conclusion of the trier of fact.

462, 467, 92 P.3d 471, 476 (2004)). 
Voluntariness of Statement 
"We apply a de novo  standard of appellate review to
the ultimate issue of the voluntariness of a confession." 
We thus "examine the entire record and make an independentdetermination of the ultimate issue of voluntariness based upon that review and the totality of the circumstancessurrounding the defendant's statement."

(citations and brackets omitted) (quoting In re John Doe, 90 
Hawai# i
 246, 251, 978 P.2d 684, 689 (1999)).  "However, it is 
well-settled that an appellate court will not pass upon issues dependent upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence; this is the province of the trial judge."  Id. (quoting State v. Buch, 83 Hawai# i 308, 321, 926 P.2d 599, 612 (1996)). 
"
Our review of whether a defendant's statement was in 
fact coerced requires determination of whether the findings
of the trial court are clearly erroneous."  "A finding offact is clearly erroneous when, although there is evidenceto support it, the reviewing court, on the entire evidence,is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed." 
Id. (citations and brackets omitted) (quoting Buch, 83 Hawai# i at 
321, 926 P.2d at 612). 
Ineffective Assistance of Counsel 
The proper standard for claims of ineffective 
assistance of counsel on appeal is whether, "viewed as a whole, 
the assistance provided was 'within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.'"  Dan v. State, 76 Hawai# i 
423, 427, 879 P.2d 528, 532 (1994) (brackets omitted) 
(quoting State v. Antone, 62 Haw. 346, 348, 615 P.2d 101, 104 (1980)). 
General claims of ineffectiveness are insufficient and 
every action or omission is not subject to inquiry. 
Specific actions or omissions alleged to be error but which
had an obvious tactical basis for benefitting  the 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
defendant's case will not be subject to further scrutiny. 
If, however, the action or omission had no obvious basis for
benefitting the defendant's case and it "resulted in the 
withdrawal or substantial impairment of a potentially
meritorious defense," then it will be evaluated asinformation that an ordinary competent criminal attorneyshould have had.  
Id. (ellipses and brackets omitted) (quoting Briones v. State, 74 
Haw. 442, 462-63, 848 P.2d 966, 976 (1993)).  "[M]atters presumably within the judgment of counsel, like trial strategy, 'will rarely be second-guessed by judicial hindsight.'"  State v. Richie, 88 Hawai# i 19, 39-40, 960 P.2d 1227, 1247-48 (1998) 
(quoting State v. Smith, 68 Haw. 304, 311, 712 P.2d 496, 501 (1986)). 
Jury Instructions 
When jury instructions or the omission thereof are at
issue on appeal, the standard of review is whether, when
read and considered as a whole, the instructions given areprejudicially insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent, ormisleading.  Erroneous instructions are presumptivelyharmful and are a ground for reversal unless itaffirmatively appears from the record as a whole that theerror was not prejudicial.  However, error is not to beviewed in isolation and considered purely in the abstract.It must be examined in the light of the entire proceedingsand given the effect which the whole record shows it to beentitled.  In that context, the real question becomeswhether there is a reasonable possibility that error mighthave contributed to conviction.  If there is such a reasonable possibility in a criminal case, then the error isnot harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and the judgment ofconviction on which it may have been based must be setaside. 
. . . Once instructional error is demonstrated, we
will vacate, without regard to whether timely objection wasmade, if there is a reasonable possibility that the errorcontributed to the defendant's conviction, i.e., that theerroneous jury instruction was not harmless beyond areasonable doubt.

IV. Discussion 
A. The Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in 
finding that Jones was fit to proceed to trial or in
refusing the motion for reconsideration of Jones'ssentence. 
In his first point of error, Jones contends that he was 
not fit to proceed or able to meaningfully participate in his 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
defense at trial and at sentencing. 
Jones's fitness to proceed was evaluated several times 
throughout the course of the proceedings.  During the pre-trial 
stage, a three-member panel was appointed.  One expert found Jones unfit, another found him fit but also either depressed or malingering, and the last found him fit but wanted Jones to have a neuropsychological evaluation.  The Circuit Court found Jones unfit to proceed on December 13, 2012 and had him committed until he became fit. 
A half-year later, the Circuit Court considered more 
reports and testimony from various experts, each of whom found that Jones was fit to proceed with the exception of one expert who was concerned that Jones may decompensate under the stress of the trial.  After also being able to observe him, the Circuit Court found Jones to be fit to proceed to trial on May 31, 2013. 
In State v. Fleming, No. CAAP-14-0000987, 2017 WL 
3614419 (Haw. Ct. App. Aug. 23, 2017), this Court held that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion when it denied a motion for a mental examination to determine competency based on the record before it, which included two separate pretrial examinations, examiners that had all agreed that the defendant was fit, and the court's own observation of the defendant.  Id. at *12.  The record here is like that in Fleming, as the Circuit Court considered reports, heard from experts and the defendant. Thus, the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in finding Jones fit to stand trial. 
As for Jones's motion for reconsideration of the 
sentence, Jones contends that he was not fit to proceed to sentencing.  The Circuit Court found Jones fit after a third evaluation prior to sentencing, where the Circuit Court heard from six experts: five found him fit and one felt that Jones was functionally impaired when it came to appreciating that he behaved in a criminal manner.  Thus, the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in denying this motion considering the evidence it had before it.  Jones also failed to present a new argument in his motion for reconsideration.  Amfac, Inc. v. Waikiki Beachcomber Inv. Co., 74 Hawai# i 85, 88, 839 P.2d 10, 16 
7  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
(1992) ("The purpose of a motion for reconsideration is to allow 
a party to present new evidence and/or arguments that could not have been presented . . . earlier . . . ."); Cho v. State, 115 Hawai# i 373, 384, 168 P.3d 17, 28 (2007).  Finally, any error in 
allowing sentencing to proceed would be harmless as Jones received the minimum sentences, which he will serve concurrently. 
B. It was not plain error for the Circuit Court to allow
Detective Akagi to comment on Jones's guilt or
innocence. 
In his second point of error, Jones argues that it was 
plainly erroneous for the Circuit Court to allow Detective Akagi 
to comment on Jones's guilt or innocence in response to a question posed by his own defense counsel: 
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  So you didn’t like what he was 
telling you?  Let me rephrase that.  That was not a fair 
question. 
[DETECTIVE AKAGI]:  Okay. 
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  You didn't believe he was telling
you the truth as you knew it? 
[PROSECUTOR]:  Objection, your honor. Calls for the
witness to comment on credibility. 
THE COURT:  Objection's overruled. [DETECTIVE AKAGI]:  I didn't feel like he was telling
me the whole events that occurred that night. 
In support, Jones cites to State v. Marsh, 68 Haw. 659, 
660–61, 728 P.2d 1301, 1302 (1986), which concerned a 
prosecutor's personal opinion expressed in her closing statement. Detective Akagi's testimony, in this case, was offered only in direct response to the question posed by Jones's own counsel.  It was counsel's strategic decision that Jones would benefit by establishing that Jones's testimony remained consistent despite Detective Akagi's expressions of disbelief.  Even if we were to override defense counsel's determination of trial strategy and conclude that it was error for the court to not intervene sua sponte and disallow counsel's question or Detective Akagai's answer, it was harmless since it merely confirmed what the video, 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
already admitted into evidence, showed.   As Akagi's answer and 
its context formed the basis for Jones's defense, no substantial 
prejudice was caused to Jones's rights. 6/
C. There was sufficient evidence to find that Jones was 
guilty. 
In his third point of error, Jones contends that he 
"was under the reasonable mistaken belief that the CW was 
performing consensual based on the interaction between the two" and that "the CW's testimony corroborates that the Appellant was not on notice that the CW did not" consent.  The test is whether there was enough credible evidence "of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable caution to reach a conclusion."  Pratt, 127 
Hawai# i at 223, 277 P.3d at 317 
(quoting Bui, 104 
Hawai# i at 467, 92 P.3d at 476). 
To provide substantial evidence for Sexual Assault in 
the First Degree, the State was required to show that Jones knowingly  and by strong compulsion  subjected the CW to acts of 
8/ 7/
6/ At various times during the interrogation, Detective Akagi said:
"You're not telling me the whole truth"; "This is your opportunity," "Do the
right thing," "I want the truth," "if you be honest about what happened lastnight or June 3rd, you know, that's the first step in taking . . . doing theright thing". 
7/ "Knowingly" is defined as follows: 
(a) A person acts knowingly with respect to his conduct
when he is aware that his conduct is of that nature. 
(b) A person acts knowingly with respect to attendantcircumstances when he is aware that such circumstances exist. 
(c) A person acts knowingly with respect to a result ofhis conduct when he is aware that it is practicallycertain that his conduct will cause such a result. 
Haw. Rev. Stat. § 702-206(2) (1993). 
8/ "Strong compulsion" means the use of or attempt
to use one or more of the following to overcome aperson: 
(1) A threat, express or implied, that places aperson in fear of bodily injury to theindividual or another person, or in fear thatthe person or another person will be kidnapped; 
(2) A dangerous instrument; or 
(continued...) 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
sexual penetration9/ by inserting his finger into her genital 
opening.  To prove the elements of Sexual Assault in the Third 
Degree, the State was required to show that Jones knowingly and by strong compulsion subjected the CW to sexual contact or caused the CW to have sexual contact
10/ with him by placing his hand on 
her breast.  The evidence came primarily from the testimony of CW, which provided substantial evidence for all counts of sexual assault.  The CW stated that Jones touched her breasts, her vaginal area from outside the underwear then inside it, and penetrated her twice with his fingers.  Further, Jones admitted to knowingly placing his hand on CW's breast.  As for the element of strong compulsion, the CW testified that Jones used physical force against her when he put her seat down, grabbed her arms with force and then used his hands to put physical pressure close to her neck.  As to consent, CW testified that she was scared, believed the situation was life-threatening, that she unsuccessfully tried to escape the car, and cooperated only to calm him down.  The CW was prevented from answering her phone several times before Jones threw her all of her belongings, including her phone into the backseat.  Overall, there was sufficient evidence to find that Jones used strong compulsion. 
To prove Kidnapping, the State was required to show 
that Jones intentionally
11/ or knowingly restrained12/ the CW with 
8/(...continued)
(3) Physical force. 
Haw. Rev. Stat. § 707-700 (Supp. 2011). 
9/ "Sexual penetration" is defined, in part, as "(1) Vaginal
intercourse, anal intercourse, fellatio, deviate sexual intercourse, or any
intrusion of any part of a person's body or of any object into the genital oranal opening of another person's body; it occurs upon any penetration, howeverslight, but emission is not required."  Haw. Rev. Stat. § 707-700. 
10/ "Sexual contact" is defined as "any touching, other than acts of
'sexual penetration', of the sexual or other intimate parts of a person notmarried to the actor, or of the sexual or other intimate parts of the actor bythe person, whether directly or through the clothing or other materialintended to cover the sexual or other intimate parts."  Haw. Rev. Stat. § 707-700. 
11/ "Intentionally" is defined as follows: 
(a) A person acts intentionally with respect to his
conduct when it is his conscious object to 
(continued...) 
10 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
the intent to terrorize13/ her.  In addition to the CW's 
aforementioned testimony, Jones stated that the CW told him that 
she wanted to be back in Waikiki after dinner, but that, instead, he drove to Sandy Beach to confront her about her medication and talk to her about his paying for both their dinners.  When CW tried to get out of the car, Jones tried to pull her back in. Thus, there was substantial evidence that suggests that Jones intentionally or knowingly took CW to Sandy Beach against her wishes to have sex with her and that he took measures to keep her in the car. 
D. It was not plain error for the "Defense to stipulate
Appellant's statement into evidence regarding the
voluntariness issue." 
Jones states his point of error three times throughout 
his opening brief.  Each time, the subject of the point is "the Defense," who we understand to be Jones's trial counsel, who, Jones alleges, erred in stipulating Jones's statements into evidence.  We understand, in that case, Jones to contend that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.  On the third occasion, however, Jones expands on his point and offers two cases which address appellate review of trial court decisions to 
11/(...continued)
engage in such conduct. 
(b) A person acts intentionally with respect to
attendant circumstances when he is aware of the existence of such circumstances or believes or hopes that they exist. 
(c) A person acts intentionally with respect to aresult of his conduct when it is his conscious object to cause such a result.  
Haw. Rev. Stat. § 702-206(1). 
12/ In pertinent part: 
"Restrain" means to restrict a person's movement in such a
manner as to interfere substantially with the person's liberty: 
(1) By means of force, threat, or deception[.] 
Haw. Rev. Stat. § 707-700. 
13/ In the jury instructions, the "intent to terrorize" is defined as
"the intent to cause or the reckless disregard of the risk of causing another
person to have serious alarm for personal safety." 
11  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
admit statements which were allegedly coerced.  Jones, however, 
offers no argument explaining how those cases apply to the facts of his case, while adding a non-specific reference to his "disabilities" requiring a determination of "reversible error."  
To the extent that Jones intends to argue what he says 
in his point of error, i.e. ineffective assistance of trial counsel, we deem that argument waived, as none is made.  Haw. R. App. P. 28(b)(7) ("Points not argued may be deemed waived.") To the extent that Jones intends instead to argue that the Circuit Court erred in admitting the stipulated statements, we deem that 
argument waived as well.  Id. 
E. The Circuit Court erred in not giving a jury
instruction regarding consent. 
Although not objected-to at trial and not properly 
raised as a point of error on appeal, Jones argues that the 
Circuit Court erred in not instructing the jury as to the definition of consent and specifically that consent could be either express or implied.
14/  The Circuit Court mentioned 
consent, but did not define it, in its instructions defining the "compulsion" and "restraint" elements of the various sections under which Jones was tried: "'Compulsion' means absence of consent, or a threat, express or implied, that places a person in fear of public humiliation, property damage, or financial loss." Furthermore, "consent" was addressed in passing throughout the parties' closing arguments.  
Jones is correct that the testimony in the case does 
not show that the CW ever expressly objected to anything, and both accounts of the underlying incident indicate that the CW initiated some of the sexual contact, although CW explains that this only reflected an attempt to calm Jones.  As such, though, Jones argues the not implausible proposition that he was under a reasonable mistaken belief that the incident was consensual. 
14/ Jones failed to comply with Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure
Rule 28(4) as this argument was not mentioned in his points of error,
questions presented, or standards of review.  However, as an appellate court,
we can take notice a plain error not properly presented. State v. Getz , 131 
Hawai #i 19, 27, 313 P.3d 708, 716 (2013); State v. Pond , 118 Hawai #i 452, 467, 
193 P.3d 368, 383 (2008). 
12  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Jones's failure to properly raise the issue on appeal 
notwithstanding, it is raised.  Because consent was the sole 
issue raised by Jones's defense, the jury instructions in this case should have included a definition of consent as well as an explanation that consent can be express or implied and that consent may be withdrawn. 
Jury instructions in such a case, whether or not they 
were requested by a party, should include the definition of consent as a matter of standard practice, especially when "the only real question before the jury was whether Complainant consented to the sexual acts, either expressly or impliedly." State v. Shabazz, 98 Hawai# i 358, 385, 48 P.3d 605, 632 (App. 
2002) (vacating the defendant's conviction for Second Degree Sex Assault, in part, on the basis of the trial court's failure to instruct the jury on the issue of implied consent); 
State v. 
Ancheta, 108 Hawai# i 467, 469, 121 P.3d 932, 934 (App. 2005) 
(holding that it was plain error when the trial court failed to instruct on implied consent on charges of first and second degree sex assault); cf. State v. McFadden, No. CAAP-14-0000802, 2015 WL 5567996 at *7 (Haw. Ct. App. Sept. 21, 2015) (vacating defendant's conviction on Second Degree Sex Assault, in part, because there was evidence that could be construed by reasonable jurors to have caused defendant to reasonably believe that he had the complainant's consent, and yet no instruction on mistake or ignorance was given by the court). 
The evidence in this case could support Jones's theory 
of consent which operates as a defense to all the counts.  Thus, Jones was entitled to a jury instruction that defined consent and explained that consent could be implied, as this was the central theory of his defense.  S
tate v. Locquiao, 100 Hawai# i 195, 205, 
58 P.3d 1242, 1252 (2002) ("[A] defendant is entitled to an instruction on every defense or theory of defense having any support in the evidence[.]" (quoting

Hawai# i 198, 204, 53 P.3d 806, 812 (2002))).  
This error also applies to the count of Kidnapping 
where consent was also a defense.  Thus, we vacate the Judgment for the failure to include in the jury instructions a definition 
13 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
of consent or any explanation that consent can be either express 
or implied. 
V. Conclusion 
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the Order, vacate the 
Judgment, and remand the case to the Circuit Court for further 
proceedings.
