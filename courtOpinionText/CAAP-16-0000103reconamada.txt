IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
WILLIAM MIDDLETON, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES,
Defendant-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 14-1-0437)
 
ORDER
 
(1) GRANTING THE JUNE 23, 2016 MOTION TO STRIKE
AND
 
(2) AMENDED ORDER DENYING THE
JUNE 16, 2016 MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Plaintiff-Appellant William
 
Middleton,(Appellant's), pro se, June 16, 2016 "Motion for
 
Reconsideration of Order Dismissing the Appeal for Lack of
 
Jurisdiction" (Motion to Reconsider), and June 23, 2016
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"Appellant's Motion to Strike [Defendant-]Appellee Department of 
Human Services' [(Appellee's)] Memorandum in Opposition to 
[Motion to Reconsider]" (Motion to Strike), and the record, it appears that Appellant moves this court to strike Appellee's 
June 17, 2016 opposition to the Motion to Reconsider as unauthorized. See Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 
Rule 40(c) ("No response to a motion for reconsideration or reply to a response will be received unless requested by the appellate court."). This court did not request a response to the Motion to Reconsider. 
It further appears that Appellant argues he timely
 
filed a Notice of Appeal on February 24, 2016, within 30 days
 after a January 27, 2016 Notice of Entry of Judgment, instead of
 entry of the January 19, 2016 Judgment. Thus, Appellant contends
 that his appeal was timely pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a). 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion to Strike is
 
granted. The June 17, 2016 opposition to the Motion to
 Reconsider is stricken as unauthorized.
 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the Motion to
 
Reconsider is denied.
