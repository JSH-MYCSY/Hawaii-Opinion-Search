IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
JAMES A. KRENTLER, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
LINDA D. KRENTLER, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(FC-D NO. 14-1-1731)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Hiraoka, JJ.)
Plaintiff-Appellee James A. Krentler (Husband ) and
Defendant-Appellant Linda D. Krentler ( Wife) were married on
September 22, 2006, in Honolulu, Hawai# i.  They separated on
August 31, 2014.  Their Divorce Decree  was entered by the Family
Court of the First Circuit ( Family Court)  on February 19, 2016.
Wife appeals.  She contends:1
1.the Family Court lacked subject matter juris-
diction over the divorce proceeding; and
2.the Family Court abused its discretion when it
bifurcated the divorce proceeding.
For the reasons explained below, we affirm the Divorce
Decree.
I.
On the date of their marriage Husband was 79 years old
and had a net worth of over $19 million.  Wife was 56 years old
1The Honorable Nancy Ryan presided.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
and had a net worth of about $250,000.  They signed a premarital
agreement ( PMA) before they were married.  The PMA contained a
choice of law provision stating that the Hawai#i Uniform Pre-
marital Agreement Act, Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) Chapter
572D, would govern any legal action over the PMA.  The PMA also
contained a forum selection provision stating that Hawai#i would
have "exclusive jurisdiction and venue" over any legal action.
When they separated Husband was 87 years old and Wife
was 64 years old.  Husband filed a complaint for divorce in
Hawai#i on December 8, 2014.  He sought division of assets and
debts in accordance with the PMA.  On December 30, 2014, Wife
filed for divorce in the state of Wyoming, where she was living
at the time.  She sought a declaration that the PMA was void or
invalid.  Husband moved to dismiss the Wyoming action.  The
Wyoming court dismissed Wife's action by order entered on July 1,
2015.
Husband made several unsuccessful attempts to
personally serve Wife with the Hawai#i divorce complaint. 
Husband contended that Wife was evading service.  On April 13,
2015, Husband moved to serve Wife by publication.  The Family
Court granted the motion and an affidavit of publication was
filed on May 8, 2015.  Wife was also personally served in Wyoming
on May 21, 2015.  She answered the Hawai#i divorce complaint on
June 4, 2015.  Her answer contested subject matter jurisdiction.
In the meantime, Husband filed a motion to bifurcate
the dissolution of the marriage from the other parts of the
case.  An evidentiary hearing was held on November 6, 2015.  The
motion was granted by order entered on November 16, 2015.  An
amended order was entered on December 22, 2015.  The amended
order set a trial on the issue of subject matter jurisdiction for
January 29, 2016.2
2Hawai#i divorce cases can involve up to four parts: (1) dissolu-
tion of the marriage; (2)  child custody, visitation, and support; (3) spousal
support; and (4) division and distribution of property and debts.  Kakinami v.
Kakinami, 125 Hawai #i 308, 312, 260 P.3d 1126, 1130 (2011) (citing cases).
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
The trial on jurisdiction was conducted on January 29,
2016.  The Family Court concluded that it had jurisdiction over
the case and found good cause for granting Husband a divorce and
reserving jurisdiction on all other matters.  The Divorce Decree
was filed on February 19, 2016.  The Family Court entered
findings of fact and conclusions of law on March 14, 2016.  On
April 12, 2016, the Family Court stayed further proceedings
pending appeal.  This appeal followed.
II.
A. The Family Court Had Subject Matter Jurisdiction
The jurisdiction of the family court is reviewed de
novo under the right/wrong standard.  Hsieh v. Sun, 137 Hawai#i
90, 98, 365 P.3d 1019, 1027 (App. 2016) (citing Puckett v.
Puckett, 94 Hawai#i 471, 477, 16 P.3d 876, 882 (App. 2000)).  HRS
§ 580-1(a) (Supp. 2014) provides, in relevant part:
Exclusive original jurisdiction in matters of . . . divorce,
. . . subject to section 603-37 as to change of venue, and
subject also to appeal according to law, is conferred upon
the family court of the circuit in which the applicant has
been domiciled or has been physically present for a
continuous period of at least three months next preceding
the application therefor[.] . . . No absolute divorce from
the bond of matrimony shall be granted for any cause unless
either party to the marriage has been domiciled or has been
physically present in the State for a continuous period of
at least six months next preceding the application
therefor [.]
(emphasis added).  Wife contends that subject matter jurisdiction
in divorce cases must be based on domicile, and that "it is not
sufficient for one of the parties only to have been 'physically
present' in the State of Hawaii [Hawai# i]."  Wife is wrong. 
"Hawai#i law specifically requires that either party to the
marriage be 'domiciled' or 'physically present' in the State of
Hawai#i for at least six months preceding the divorce in order
for the family court to grant a divorce."  Hsieh, 137 Hawai# i at
97, 365 P.3d at 1026 (citing HRS § 580-1(a) and Puckett, 94
Hawai#i at 482, 16 P.3d at 887) (underscoring added).  "[T]he
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
durational six-month period applies to . . . physical presence." 
Puckett, 94 Hawai# i at 482 n.12, 16 P.3d at 887 n.12.
The Family Court found:
26.Husband has been physically present in the
City & County of Honolulu for a continuous period of time
for more than six months before filing the December 8, 2014
Complaint for Divorce.
a.At the 1/29/16 Extended Hearing, Wife stipulated
that Husband was physically present in Hawaii from May 2014
to December 2014:
Mr. King: We stipulate . . . that Husband was
physically present in Hawaii from May 2014 to
December 2014.
1/29/16 Hearing Tr. at 8.
b.At the 11/6/15 Extended Hearing, Husband
testified that he lived at his home, 3019 Kalakaua Avenue,
Honolulu, for more than six months before he filed the
December 8, 2014 Complaint for Divorce:
Q. . . And have you lived there at 3019
Kalakaua Avenue for more than six months before
you filed the complaint for divorce in this
case?
AYes.
11/6/15 Hearing Tr. at 58.
Wife does not challenge this finding of fact or her stipulation. 
Because Husband was physically present in Hawai# i for at least
six months preceding the filing of his complaint for divorce, the
Family Court was right when it concluded that it had subject
matter jurisdiction over the proceeding.  We need not decide
Wife's challenges to the Family Court's findings of fact or
conclusions of law concerning Husband's domicile because
Husband's physical presence is not challenged and makes domicile
factually and legally irrelevant.
B. The Family Court Did Not Abuse its Discretion in
Bifurcating the Dissolution of the Marriage
The family court's ability to bifurcate divorce
proceedings is governed by HRS § 580-47(a) (1993 & Supp. 2014),
which provides, in relevant part:
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Upon granting a divorce, or thereafter if, in addition
to the powers granted in subsections (c) and (d),
jurisdiction of those matters is reserved under the decree
by agreement of both parties or by order of court after
finding that good cause  exists, the court may make any
further orders as shall appear just and equitable (1)
compelling the parties or either of them to provide for the
support, maintenance, and education of the children of the
parties; (2) compelling either party to provide for the
support and maintenance of the other party; (3) finally
dividing and distributing the estate of the parties, real,
personal, or mixed, whether community, joint, or separate;
and (4) allocating, as between the parties, the
responsibility for the payment of the debts of the parties
whether community, joint, or separate, and the attorney's
fees, costs, and expenses incurred by each party by reason
of the divorce.
(emphasis added).  Thus, "good cause" is the proper standard
for bifurcating the dissolution of marriage from the remaining
parts of a divorce case.  Kakinami, 125 Hawai#i at 314, 260 P.3d
at 1132.
Generally, the family court possesses wide discretion in
making its decisions and those decisions will not be set
aside unless there is a manifest abuse of discretion.  Thus,
we will not disturb the family court's decisions on appeal
unless the family court disregarded rules or principles of
law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party
litigant and its decision clearly exceeded the bounds of
reason.
Id. at 311-12, 260 P.3d at 1129-30 (citations omitted).  Wife
agrees that the standard for bifurcation is "good cause," but
contends that the Family Court abused its discretion in finding
good cause in this case.  We disagree.
 An action for divorce is a purely personal matter
which extinguishes upon the death of either party.  See Camp v.
Camp, 109 Hawai#i 469, 128 P.3d 351 (App. 2006) (holding that
party's death prior to entry of formal divorce decree
extinguished divorce action and family court's jurisdiction to
enter divorce decree).  The possible abatement of a divorce
action constitutes good cause under HRS § 580–47(a) for granting
petitioner a divorce and reserving jurisdiction over all other
matters.  Kakinami, 125 Hawai# i at 314, 260 P.3d at 1132.  The
Family Court made numerous findings of fact concerning Husband's
advanced age, medical problems, and life expectancy, all of which
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
are supported by substantial evidence in the record.  The Family
Court also made numerous findings of fact concerning Wife
substantially delaying the resolution of Husband's divorce
action, all of which are supported by substantial evidence in the
record.  Finally, the Family Court made findings, which were
supported by substantial evidence in the record, that Husband's
death before dissolution of the marriage would cause unfair
prejudice to Husband because Husband's estate would be required
to pay an additional $500,000 to Wife under the PMA.  We hold
that the Family Court did not abuse its discretion in bifurcating
the dissolution of Husband's and Wife's marriage from the
remaining parts of the case.
III.
 Based upon the foregoing, the Divorce Decree entered by
the Family Court of the First Circuit on February 19, 2016, is
affirmed.
