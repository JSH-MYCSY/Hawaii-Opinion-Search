(5) On May 18, 2016, the court denied the April 4, 2016
 
motion without prejudice to a subsequent motion that reflects
 
service upon Appellee;
 
(6) On July 13, 2016, Appellant again filed another
 
"Motion for Withdrawal of Appeal";
 
(7) On July 15, 2016, the appellate clerk notified 
Appellant that the time for filing the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief had expired and, pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 30, the matter would be called to the court’s attention on July 25, 2016, for appropriate action, which could include dismissal; 
(8) On July 18, 2016, Appellant filed a document
 
purporting to demonstrate proof of service of a "Motion for
 Withdrawal of Appeal" on two individuals who are not party to
 this appeal; and
 
(9) On July 25, 2016, Appellant filed a letter
 
requesting the court to decide his "Withdrawal Motion."
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is
 
dismissed for failure to file the opening brief, pursuant to HRAP
 Rule 30. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are 
dismissed.
