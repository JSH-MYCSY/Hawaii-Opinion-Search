NAKAMURA, C.J., and LEONARD and REIFURTH, JJ.
OPINION OF THE COURT BY NAKAMURA, C.J.
In his underlying criminal case, Petitioner-Appellant
Dean Daniel Mara (Mara) was convicted, after a jury trial, of
manslaughter, reckless endangering, and place to keep loaded
firearm.  Respondent-Appellee State of Hawai #i (State) moved for
extended terms of imprisonment on the grounds that Mara was a
"persistent offender" and a "multiple offender" whose
imprisonment for an extended term was necessary for protection of
the public.  The Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit
Court) granted the motion and sentenced Mara to concurrent
extended terms of life imprisonment with the possibility ofFOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

criminal case and the Petition at issue in this appeal.
2parole, ten years of imprisonment, and twenty years of
imprisonment.  The Circuit Court entered its Judgment on March
11, 1999, and Mara filed a direct appeal from his Judgment.  The
Hawai#i Supreme Court affirmed the Judgment in an opinion issued
on February 15, 2002, State v. Mara , 98 Hawai #i 1, 41 P.3d 157
(2002), and Mara's conviction and sentence became final in 2002.
On November 23, 2015, Mara filed a petition for post-
conviction relief pursuant to Hawai #i Rules of Penal Procedure
(HRPP) Rule 40 (2006) (Petition).  Mara sought relief on the
grounds that: (1) his extended terms of imprisonment were illegal
under Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000); and (2) his
appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to assert his
Apprendi claim on direct appeal.  On February 2, 2016, the
Circuit Court denied Mara's Petition and filed its "Order Denying
Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release
Petitioner from Custody" (Order Denying Petition).  In denying
the Petition, the Circuit Court relied on this court's opinion in
Loher v. State, 118 Hawai #i 522, 193 P.3d 438 (App. 2008) ( Loher
I).
Mara appeals from the Order Denying Petition.  On
appeal, Mara contends that the Circuit Court1/ erred in rejecting
his Apprendi-based challenges to his extended term sentences. 
The State contends that our opinion in Loher I is no longer "good
law," and it agrees with Mara that the Circuit Court should have
granted Mara's Petition based on his Apprendi  claim.  We disagree
with Mara's arguments and the State's contention that Loher I  is
no longer good law.  
As explained in greater detail below, until its 2007
decision in State v. Maugaotega , 115 Hawai #i 432, 168 P.3d 562
(2007) ( Maugaotega II), the Hawai #i Supreme Court steadfastly  
held that Hawai #i's extended term sentencing scheme comported
with Apprendi.  Maugaotega II , 115 Hawai #i at 437-42, 168 P.3d at
567-72.  It was only the United States Supreme Court's decisionFOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
3in Cunningham v. California, 549 U.S. 270 (2007), that caused the
Hawai#i Supreme Court to change its view.  Maugaotega II , 115
Hawai#i at 442-47, 168 P.3d at 572-77.  In Loher I , we relied on
the Hawai #i Supreme Court's multiple precedents prior to
Cunningham , which had rejected  Apprendi -based challenges to
Hawai#i's extended term sentencing scheme, in holding that 
Apprendi did not apply to Loher's collateral attack of his
extended term sentence, which became final in 2003.  Loher I , 
118 Hawai #i at 536-38, 193 P.3d at 452-54.
Mara and the State rely on federal district court and
federal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (Ninth Circuit) decisions
granting habeas corpus relief and vacating extended term
sentences imposed on Hawai #i defendants.  Decisions of the
federal district court in Hawai #i and the Ninth Circuit hold,
contrary to the Hawai #i Supreme Court's precedents, that it was
immediately clear once Apprendi  was decided that Hawai# i's
extended term sentencing scheme was unconstitutional.  The
Hawai#i Supreme Court was aware of the analysis of the Ninth
Circuit and the district court but declined to follow it, noting
that state courts are only bound by decisions of the United
States Supreme Court.  State v. White, 110 Hawai# i 79, 81-82 &
n.4, 129 P.3d 1107, 1109-10 & n.4 (2006).  This court is bound by
the precedents of the Hawai# i Supreme Court.  Based on Hawai# i
Supreme Court precedent, we conclude that Loher I  remains good
law and that Mara's extended term sentences, which became final
in 2002, are not subject to collateral attack.
BACKGROUND
The State indicted Mara in 1997 and charged him with 
second-degree murder of Stella Jensen (Count 1); attempted first-
degree murder of Jensen and Gary Akopian (Count 2); attempted
second-degree murder of Akopian (Count 3); possession of a
firearm by a person convicted of certain crimes (Count 4);
possession of ammunition by a person convicted of certain crimes
(Count 5); and place to keep a loaded firearm (Count 6).  Mara,
98 Hawai# i at 3, 41 P.3d at 159.  The jury found Mara guilty of
reckless manslaughter (Count 1), reckless endangering (Count 3), FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2The jury acquitted Mara of Counts 2 and 4, and Count 5 was dismissed by
the prosecution.  Mara, 98 Hawai# i at 10 & n.9; 41 P.3d at 166 & n.9.   
3At the time relevant to Mara's charges and his sentencing, HRS § 706-
662(1) and (4) (Supp. 1996) provided, in relevant part:
A convicted defendant may be subject to an extended term of
imprisonment under section 706–661, if the convicted defendant
satisfies one or more of the following criteria:
(1) The defendant is a persistent offender whose
imprisonment for an extended term is necessary for
protection of the public.  The court shall not make
this finding unless the defendant has previously been
convicted of two felonies committed at different times
when the defendant was eighteen years of age or older.
. . . . [or]
(4) The defendant is a multiple offender whose criminal
actions were so extensive that a sentence of
imprisonment for an extended term is necessary for
protection of the public.  The court shall not make
this finding unless:
(a) The defendant is being sentenced for two or more
felonies or is already under sentence of
imprisonment for felony[.]
4Mara had been convicted of first-degree rape, first-degree sex abuse,
kidnapping, and unauthorized control of a propelled vehicle (UCPV) in Cr. No.
86-0960 and UCPV in Cr. No. 93-2821. 
4and place to keep loaded firearm (Count 6).  Id. at 10, 41 P.3d
166.2/
The State moved for extended terms of imprisonment on
the grounds that Mara was a "persistent offender" under Hawaii
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 706-662(1) and a "multiple offender"
under HRS § 706-662(4) whose imprisonment for an extended term
was necessary for protection of the public.3/  The State asserted
that Mara was a persistent offender due to his five prior felony
convictions4/ and a "multiple offender" due to the jury's guilty
verdicts on three felony counts.  The Circuit Court granted the
State's motion and sentenced Mara to concurrent extended terms of
life imprisonment, with the possibility of parole, on Count 1,
ten years of imprisonment on Count 3, and twenty-years of
imprisonment on Count 6.  Based on Mara's status as a repeat
offender, the Circuit Court also imposed mandatory minimum terms
of imprisonment of thirteen years and four months, three years
and four months, and six years and eight months on Counts 1, 3,FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
5and 6, respectively.  The Circuit Court entered its Judgment of
conviction and sentence (Judgment) on March 11, 1999.
Mara filed a direct appeal of his Judgment.  On
February 15, 2002, the Hawai# i Supreme Court issued an opinion
affirming the Circuit Court's Judgment.  Mara, 98 Hawai #i at 17,
41 P.3d at 173.  The supreme court entered its judgment on appeal
on March 7, 2002.  There is no indication that Mara petitioned
for a writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court. 
Therefore, Mara's conviction and sentence became final on or
about June 5, 2002, ninety days after the judgment on appeal was
entered.  
On April 28, 2004, Mara filed a petition for post-
conviction relief, which the Circuit Court summarily denied.
On November 23, 2015, Mara filed the Petition that is
at issue in this appeal.  In the Petition, Mara argued that: (1)
his extended term sentences were illegal under Apprendi  because
they were based on facts found by the judge, and not by a jury;
and (2) his appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance by
failing to raise an Apprendi claim on appeal.  The State opposed
Mara's Petition.  The Circuit Court denied the Petition, citing
this court's opinion in Loher I in support of its decision.  The
Circuit Court noted that Mara's conviction and sentence became
final in 2002, prior to the Hawai #i Supreme Court's ruling in
Maugaotega II, and that Mara was not entitled to a retroactive
application of Maugaotega II.  The Circuit Court entered its
Order Denying Petition on February 2, 2016, and this appeal
followed.
DISCUSSION
On appeal, Mara argues that the Circuit Court erred in
denying his Petition because his extended term sentences were
illegal based on  Apprendi .  Despite opposing Mara's Petition in
the Circuit Court, the State on appeal contends that the Circuit
Court erred in concluding that Mara could not collaterally attack
his extended term sentences based on Apprend i.  Citing federal
district court and Ninth Circuit cases, the State argues that the
decision in Apprendi , and not any subsequent decision, is theFOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
6"demarcation point" in determining whether a defendant may
collaterally attack an extended term sentence imposed by a judge
without findings by a jury.  The State therefore asserts that
this court's decision in Loher I "is not good law" and that
Mara's extended term sentences, which became final after  Apprendi
was decided in 2000, must be vacated.  
It is well settled that the State's concession of error
is not binding on an appellate court, and that when the State
concedes error, it is still "incumbent on the appellate court" to
independently determine whether the concession "is supported by
the record and well-founded in law[.]"  State v. Hoang , 93
Hawai#i 333, 336, 3 P.3d 499, 502 (2000) (internal quotation
marks and citation omitted).  In light of Hawai# i Supreme Court
precedents, which are binding on this court, we conclude that the
State's concession of error is not well-founded in law or
supported by the record.  As explained below, we conclude that
Loher I is still good law with respect to collateral attacks
based on Apprendi.  We further conclude that in determining
whether Hawai #i extended term sentences imposed by a judge
without jury findings are subject to collateral attack, the line
of demarcation is Cunningham, and not Apprendi.
I.
The issue presented in this case is not whether
Apprendi applies retroactively.  Retroactive application refers
to applying decisions to cases that became final before the
decision was rendered.  Mara's conviction and sentence became
final in 2002, after Apprendi  was decided in 2000.  Nor is the
issue whether Hawai #i's extended term sentencing scheme violated
Apprendi  as interpreted and clarified by subsequent United States
Supreme Court decisions.  In Maugaotega II , the Hawai# i Supreme
Court held that in light of the United States Supreme Court's
interpretation and application of  Apprendi in Cunningham, the
Hawai#i Supreme Court's "long-held belief" that Hawai# i's extended
term sentencing scheme complied with Apprendi  could not stand.

5See Butler v. McKellar, 494 U.S. 407, 414 (1990) ("The 'new rule'
principle . . . validates reasonable, good-faith interpretations of existing
precedents made by state courts even though they are shown to be contrary to
later decisions.").
7Instead, the issue in this case is what precedent
dictated the conclusion that Hawai #i's extended term sentencing
scheme was unconstitutional.  In other words, when did it become
clear that the Apprendi decision meant that Hawai #i's extended
term sentencing scheme was unconstitutional.  Subject to
exceptions not applicable here, a judicial decision which
announces a new rule does not apply retroactively to convictions
which have become final.  Teague v. Lane , 489 U.S. 288 (1989). 
"[A] case announces a new rule if the result was not dictated  by
precedent existing at the time the defendant's conviction became
final."  Id.  at 301.5/  The deciding question in this case is
what precedent dictated and made it clear that Hawai# i's extended
term sentencing scheme was unconstitutional.  The Hawai #i Supreme
Court's answer to this question is  Cunningham .           
In Maugaotega II , the Hawai #i Supreme Court held that
Cunningham  was the first United States Supreme Court precedent
that dictated and made clear that Hawai #i's extended term
sentencing scheme was unconstitutional.  Maugaotega II , 115
Hawai#i at 445-46, 168 P.3d at 575-76.  Before Maugaotega II , the
Hawai#i Supreme Court, in a series of decisions, steadfastly held
that Hawai #i's extended term sentencing scheme was constitutional
under Apprendi and its progeny.  See Loher I, 118 Hawai #i at 536,
183 P.3d at 452.
In State v. Kaua , 102 Hawai #i 1, 72 P.3d 473 (2003), 
the Hawai #i Supreme Court held that because of the limitations it
had imposed on Hawai #i's extended term sentencing scheme through
its intrinsic/extrinsic analysis, the Hawai# i scheme comported
with Apprendi and "fell outside the Apprendi  rule[.]"  Kaua, 102
Hawai#i at 11-13, 72 P.3d at 483-85.  In the years following
Apprendi, the United States Supreme Court refined its Sixth
Amendment analysis in a 2004 decision, Blakely v. Washington , 542
U.S. 296 (2004), and a 2005 decision, United States v. Booker ,
543 U.S. 220 (2005).  Neither Blakely nor Booker altered theFOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
8Hawai#i Supreme Court's conclusion that Hawai# i's extended term
sentencing scheme complied with Apprendi  and a criminal
defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial.  In State v.
Rivera, 106 Hawai# i 146, 102 P.3d 1044 (2004), the Hawai# i Supreme
Court reaffirmed its conclusion that the Hawai #i extended term
sentencing scheme complied with Apprendi after considering the
decision in Blakely , and in S tate v. Maugaotega, 107 Hawai #i 399,
114 P.3d 905 (2005) ( Maugaotega I), it again reaffirmed this view
after considering the decision in Booker .
II.
The federal district court in Hawai #i and the Ninth
Circuit disagreed with the Hawai# i Supreme Court's Apprendi
analysis.  In Kaua v. Frank, 350 F.Supp.2d 848 (D. Haw. 2004)
(Federal Kaua I ), the federal district court granted Kaua's
habeas corpus petition, holding that Kaua's extended term
sentence clearly violated Apprendi and that the Hawai# i Supreme
Court's failure to overturn Kaua's extended sentence based on
Apprendi "was contrary to, and involved an unreasonable
application of, clearly established federal law[.]"  Federal Kaua
I, 350 F.Supp.2d at 850, 860.  The federal district court ordered
the State to resentence Kaua in a manner consistent with the
court's decision.  Id.  at 861.  The Ninth Circuit agreed with the
district court that the Hawai #i Supreme Court's affirmance of
Kaua's extended sentence was contrary to the decision in
Apprendi , and the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's
grant of Kaua's petition for writ of habeas corpus.  Kaua v.
Frank, 436 F.3d 1057, 1062 (9th Cir. 2006) ( Federal Kaua II ).
In White, the Hawai# i Supreme Court acknowledged the
federal district court and Ninth Circuit decisions in Federal
Kaua I and Federal Kaua I I.  White, 110 Hawai #i at 81 n.4, 129
P.3d at 1109 n.4.  It further noted, however, that only the
holdings of the United States Supreme Court, and not of lower
federal courts, were binding on state courts.  Id.  The Hawai #i
Supreme Court "decline[d] to follow" the holdings of the federal
courts in Federal Kaua I  and Federal Kaua II , and it again in
White reaffirmed its holding that "Hawai #i's extended termFOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
6Hawai#i was not alone in concluding that its statutory scheme providing
for judicially enhanced sentences did not violate Apprendi.  For example, New
York's persistent felony offender sentencing statute, which was very similar
to Hawai# i's "persistent offender" extended term sentencing provision, was
upheld against Apprendi challenge by New York's highest court in 
People v.
Rosen, 752 N.E.2d 844 (N.Y. 2003).  Like Hawai# i's persistent offender
provision, the New York persistent felony offender statute provided for an
enhanced sentence based on a judge's determination that the defendant has been
previously convicted of two or more felonies for which a sentence of over one
year was imposed and that the judge, after considering enumerated factors, is
of the opinion that the enhanced sentence is warranted.  
Rosen, 752 N.E.2d at
847.
9sentencing scheme does not run afoul of Apprendi[.]"  Id. at 81-
82 & n.4, 129 P.3d at 1109-10 & n.4.
III.
On appeal, the State cites Federal Kaua II and federal
district court cases granting habeas relief to Hawai# i defendants
sentenced to extended terms of imprisonment in asserting that
Apprendi constitutes the demarcation point in determining whether
a Hawai#i extended term sentence imposed by a judge is subject to
collateral attack.  In doing so, the State adopts Federal Kaua
II's holding that the Hawai
#i Supreme Court's decision to affirm
Kaua's extended term sentence was contrary to  Apprendi .  However,
it is well settled that a state court is not bound by the lower
federal courts' interpretation of the federal constitution or
federal law, but is only bound by the United States Supreme
Court's interpretation.  See White , 110 Hawai #i at 81 n.4, 129
P.3d at 1109 n.4; Loher I , 118 Hawai #i at 536 n.16, 193 P.3d at
452 n.16. 
More importantly, this court is bound by the decisions
and holdings of the Hawai #i Supreme Court.  Until Maugaotega II,
the Hawai #i Supreme Court repeatedly upheld the constitutionally
of Hawai #i's extended term sentencing scheme in the face of
challenges based on Apprendi and its progeny, Blakely and
Booker.6/  It was the United States Supreme Court's 2007 decision
in Cunningham  that caused the Hawai# i Supreme Court to change its
view and hold that Hawai# i's extended term sentencing scheme was
unconstitutional under Apprendi , despite the limitations the
Hawai#i Supreme Court had imposed through its intrinsic/extrinsic
analysis.  Therefore, under the Hawai# i Supreme Court'sFOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
7As the decisions of the Hawai# i Supreme Court between Apprendi and
Cunningham show, when Mara's convictions and sentences became final in 2002,
the question of whether Mara's extended term sentences violated Apprendi "was
susceptible to debate among reasonable minds," Butler, 494 U.S. at 415, and
the validity of an 
Apprendi-based challenge to Mara's extended term sentences
was not "apparent to all reasonable jurists."  Beard v. Banks, 542 U.S. 406,
413 (2004) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  
8E.g., Napeahi v. State, No. 28809, 2009 WL 338088 (Hawai# i App. Feb.
12, 2009), cert. denied, 2009 WL 2105641 (May 1, 2009); Freitas v. State, No.
29808, 2010 WL 2024730 (Hawai
#i App. May 21, 2010), cert. denied, SCWC-10-

cert. denied, No. SCWC-30507, 2012 WL
1677430 (Hawai
#i May 14, 2012).
10interpretation of federal constitutional law, it was Cunningham
and not Apprendi  that announced the new rule that dictated and
made clear that Hawai #i's extended term sentencing scheme was
unconstitutional.7/  Accordingly, based on the precedents of the
Hawai#i Supreme Court, it is Cunningham  that establishes the line
of demarcation -- that is, extended term sentences that became
final after  Apprendi  but before Cunningham are not subject to
collateral attack.
IV.
In Loher I , we considered Loher's challenge to his
extended term sentence which had become final in 2003, after
Apprendi but before Blakely, Booker, and Cunningham.  After
citing post-Apprendi  decisions of the Hawai# i Supreme Court from
Kaua to Maugaotega II, which included cases upholding Hawai #i's
extended term sentencing scheme against Apprendi-based challenges
after Blakely and Booker , we held that Loher could not
collaterally attack his extended term sentence based on Apprendi . 
Loher I, 118 Hawai #i at 534-38, 193 P.3d at 450-54.  In Loher's
case, we did not need to reach the question of whether Cunningham
established a new rule because Loher's sentence became final even
before Blakely and Booker .  Id. at 537-38, 193 P.3d at 453-54. 
Since Loher I was decided, we have upheld extended term sentences
that became final after Apprendi  but before Blakely and Booker in
numerous cases, including several in which applications for writs
of certiorari were denied by the Hawai# i Supreme Court.8/
V.FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
9Given the Hawai #i Supreme Court's repeated rejection of Apprendi -based
challenges to the constitutionality of Hawai# i's extended term sentencing
scheme prior to  Maugaotega II, we also conclude that Mara's appellate counsel
was not ineffective for failing to assert an Apprendi  claim on direct appeal
of Mara's Judgment. 
11We acknowledge that based on Federal Kaua I  and Federal
Kaua II, it appears that a Hawai# i defendant would be able go to
federal court and obtain habeas corpus relief to vacate an
extended term sentence imposed by a judge that was not final
before Apprendi .  However, this was also true when the Hawai #i
Supreme Court decided White.  Despite the availability of federal
habeas corpus relief, this court is still bound by the decisions
of the Hawai# i Supreme Court.  Based on Hawai# i Supreme Court
precedents, we conclude that Mara is not entitled to collaterally
attack his extended term sentences based on Apprendi.9/

Based on the foregoing, we affirm the Circuit Court's
Order Denying Petition.
