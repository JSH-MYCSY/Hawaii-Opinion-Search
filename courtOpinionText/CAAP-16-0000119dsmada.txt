APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 11-1-2149)

 
ORDER DISMISSING THE APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Upon review of the records in CAAP-16-0000119, it
 
appears that this court lacks appellate jurisdiction over the
 
appeal. Defendant-Appellant Mel Daniel Horner (Appellant)
 appeals pro se from the Circuit Court's April 6, 2015 
(1) Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment as to all Claims and all 
Parties, Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure and Order of Sale, (2) Judgment Re: Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order
 Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment as to all Claims
 and all Parties, Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure and Order of
 Sale, and (3) Notice of Entry of Judgment. On April 6, 2015 the
 Circuit Court ordered foreclosure of 1340 Hooli Circle, TMK 9-7­073-004 CPR 0001 and sale of the property. 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 667-51 authorizes an 
appeal from a judgment entered on a decree of foreclosure. 
The 
"court has previously noted that “foreclosure cases are bifurcated into two separately appealable parts: (1) the decree of foreclosure and the order of sale, if the order of sale is incorporated within the decree; and (2) all other orders.” Beneficial Hawaii, Inc. v. Casey, 98 Hawai
'i 159, 165, 45 P.3d 
359, 365 (2002). "A litigant who wishes to challenge a decree of foreclosure and order of sale may - - and, indeed, must - - do so within the thirty day period following entry of the decree or will lose the right to appeal that portion of the foreclosure proceeding." Id. 
Appellant filed his Notice of Appeal on February 22,
 
2016, more than 30 days after entry of the April 6, 2015
 (1) Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting
 Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment as to all Claims and all
 Parties, Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure and Order of Sale
 and (2) Judgment Re: Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and
 Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment as to all
 Claims and all Parties, Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure and

Order of Sale Therefore, the appeal was untimely. HRAP Rule
 
4(a)(1). The failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a
 civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot
 waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise
 of judicial discretion. Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727
 
P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986). Accordingly, the court lacks appellate
 jurisdiction over the appeal.

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is dismissed for
 
lack of appellate jurisdiction.

 Appellant's reference to his filing of bankruptcy notice is to no
avail because, inter alia, the bankruptcy notice was filed well after the time
to appeal expired and the automatic stay has been lifted.
