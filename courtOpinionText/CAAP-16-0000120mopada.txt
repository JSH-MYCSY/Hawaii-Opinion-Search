v. 
SUMMER N. JENKINS, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-15-02505) 
MEMORANDUM OPINION 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Summer N. Jenkins (Jenkins) appeals 
from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/ 
Judgment (Judgment
) entered by the District Court of the First 
Circuit, Wahiawâ Division (District Court)  on February 4, 2016. 
Jenkins contends:  (1) the charge was fatally defective for 
failing to define "alcohol"; (2) Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 
§§ 291E-1 (2007 & Supp. 2014) and -61 (Supp. 2014) are 
unconstitutionally vague; (3) the District Court failed to 
conduct a proper Tachibana colloquy; (4) the District Court 
erroneously applied a "totality of circumstances" burden of proof 
rather than "proof beyond a reasonable doubt"; and (5) there was 
insufficient evidence to support her conviction.  For the reasons 
explained below, we vacate the Judgment and remand for a new 
trial. 21

On June 8, 2015, Jenkins was charged by complaint with 
operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant (OVUII) 
and other infractions.  The complaint alleged, in relevant part: 
COUNT 1:  On or about June 28, 2014, in the City and
County of Honolulu, State of Hawai #i, SUMMER N. JENKINS did
intentionally, knowingly or recklessly operate or assume
actual physical control of a vehicle upon a public way,street, road, or highway while under the influence ofalcohol in an amount sufficient to impair her normal mentalfaculties or ability to care for herself and guard againstcasualty, thereby committing the offense of Operating aVehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant, in violationof Section 291E-61(a)(1) of the Hawai #i [sic] Revised 
Statutes. 
She was tried and convicted on December 3, 2015.  This appeal 
followed. 
1. Jenkins contends that the complaint was fatally 
defective because it did not define the term "alcohol."  Her argument is without merit.  State v. Tsujimura, 140 Hawai# i 299, 
309, 400 P.3d 500, 510 (2017) (Holding that "even without the statutory definition of 'alcohol,' the complaint 'fully defines 
the offense in unmistakable terms,' is 'readily comprehensible to 
persons of common understanding,' and is, therefore, 
sufficient."). 
2. Jenkins next contends that HRS §§ 291E-1 and -61 
are unconstitutionally vague.  That argument is also without merit.  State v. Goo, No. CAAP-16-0000369, 2019 WL 1219107, at *1 
(Haw. App. Mar. 15, 2019) (SDO) (citing Tsujimura). 
3. Jenkins also contends that the District Court 
failed to engage her in the colloquy required by Tachibana v. State, 79 Hawai
#i 226, 900 P.2d 1293 (1995).  The validity of a 
criminal defendant's waiver of the right to testify is a question 
of constitutional law reviewed under the right/wrong standard. 
State v. Celestine, 142 Hawai# i 165, 169, 415 P.3d 907, 911 
(2018). 
Hawai #i law has historically protected both the right to
testify and the right not to testify.  The right to testify
is guaranteed by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to theUnited States Constitution; the Hawai #i Constitution's 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
parallel guarantees under article I, sections 5, 10, and 14;
and HRS § 801–2.  The right not to testify is guaranteed bythe United States Constitution's Fifth Amendment guaranteeagainst compelled testimony and the Hawai #i Constitution's 
parallel guarantee under article I, section 10. 
Celestine, 142 Hawai# i at 169, 415 P.3d at 911 (citations 
omitted).  In Tachibana, the Hawai# i Supreme Court established 
requirements that trial courts advise criminal defendants of the 
right to testify and obtain an on-the-record waiver of that 
right.  79 Hawai# i at 236, 900 P.2d at 1303. 
There are two components of the Tachibana requirement. 
The first is that the trial court inform the defendant: 
that he or she has a right to testify, that if he or she
wants to testify that no one can prevent him or her fromdoing so, and that if he or she testifies the prosecutionwill be allowed to cross-examine him or her.  In connection with the privilege against self-incrimination, the defendantshould also be advised that he or she has a right not totestify and that if he or she does not testify then the jurycan be instructed about that right. 
Celestine, 142 Hawai# i at 170, 415 P.3d at 912 (brackets omitted) 
(citing Tachibana, 79 Hawai
#i at 236 n.7, 900 P.2d at 1303 n.7). 
Jenkins does not challenge the adequacy of the District Court's 
advisement. 
The second component of the Tachibana requirement 
involves the court engaging in a "colloquy" with the defendant 
"in which the judge ascertains the defendant's understanding of 
the proceedings and of the defendant’s rights."  Celestine, 142 
Hawai# i at 170, 415 P.3d at 912 (citations and emphasis omitted). 
The trial court must "elicit[ ] responses as to whether the defendant intends to not testify, whether anyone is forcing the 
defendant not to testify, and whether the decision to not testify 
is the defendant's."  Id. at 170-71, 415 P.3d at 912-13 (citation 
omitted).  In this case the District Court engaged in the 
following exchange with Jenkins after the defense rested: 
THE COURT:  Okay.  So, Miss Jenkins, I mentioned
before that when your case is closed that -- well, when the
State's case is finished, you have a right to testify --come up here, get sworn under oath, and testify.  If you 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
testify, the prosecutor will cross-examine you in all
matters relating to your testimony. 
Also mentioned you have a constitutional right not to
testify.  If you don't testify, I will not use the fact youdidn't testify against you when I decide whether you'reguilty or not guilty.  I've also mentioned that you shouldfirst consult with your attorney, but the decision in theend is yours, whether you're going to testify or not. 
I've been told at this time that -- by your attorney
that he's resting your case.  That means that it appearsthat you will not be testifying.  At this time, I need toknow just personally whether it's your personal decision notto testify or not. 
[JENKINS]:  Yes. 
THE COURT:  Okay, thank you. 
This exchange should have taken place before the defense rested. 
See Celestine, 142 Hawai# i at 170 & n.12, 415 P.3d at 912 & n.12 
(citations omitted).  The District Court did not ask Jenkins whether her mind was clear, whether she was under the influence 
of any drug, medication, alcohol, or suffering from or being 
treated for any mental illness that would affect her ability to 
think clearly, whether anyone was forcing her, threatening her, 
or promising her anything in exchange for her decision not to 
testify or whether she had any questions for the court before 
making her decision. 
"In determining whether a waiver of the right to 
testify was voluntarily and intelligently made, this court looks 
to the totality of the facts and circumstances of each particular 
case."  Celestine, 142 Hawai# i at 171, 415 P.3d at 913 (citation 
omitted).  Under the facts and circumstances described above, we hold that the District Court did not engage Jenkins in a colloquy 
sufficient to elicit Jenkins' understanding of the proceedings 
and of her rights.  Compare State v. Borge, No. CAAP-18-0000012, 
2019 WL 762419 (Haw. App. Feb. 21, 2019) (SDO) (holding that 
Tachibana colloquy was deficient), and State v. Goebel, No. 
CAAP-15-0000701, 2018 WL 3135415 (Haw. App. June 27, 2018) (SDO) 
(same), with State v. Martin, No. CAAP-14-0001090, 2019 WL 
1435123 (Haw. App. Mar. 29, 2019) (SDO) (sufficient Tachibana 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
colloquy), and State v. Horvath, No. CAAP-17-0000349, 2018 WL 
3154778 (Haw. App. June 28, 2018), cert. rejected, No. 
SCWC-17-0000349, 2018 WL 4659785 (Haw. Sept. 28, 2018) (SDO) 
(same). 
4. Because we hold that the District Court did not 
engage Jenkins in a sufficient Tachibana colloquy, we need not address whether the District Court erroneously applied a 
"totality of circumstances" burden of proof rather than "proof 
beyond a reasonable doubt." 
5. Even though we hold that the District Court did 
not engage Jenkins in a sufficient Tachibana colloquy, we must address Jenkins' contention that there was insufficient evidence 
to support her conviction.  State v. Davis, 133 Hawai# i 102, 118, 
324 P.3d 912, 928 (2014) (under article I, section 10 of 
Hawai# i 
Constitution, "even where the [reviewing] court finds trial 
error, challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence must always 
be decided on appeal because the double jeopardy clause bars 
retrial of a defendant once a reviewing court has found the 
evidence at trial to be legally insufficient to support a 
conviction"). 
When reviewing the sufficiency of evidence on appeal, 
we apply the following deferential standard of review: 
[E]vidence adduced in the trial court must be considered in
the strongest light for the prosecution when the appellatecourt passes on the legal sufficiency of such evidence tosupport a conviction; the same standard applies whether thecase was before a judge or jury.  The test on appeal is notwhether guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt, butwhether there was substantial evidence to support theconclusion of the trier of fact. 
State v. Kalaola, 124 Hawai# i 43, 49, 237 P.3d 1109, 1115 (2010) 
(citation omitted).  "'Substantial evidence' . . . is credible 
evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to 
enable a person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion." 
Id. (citations omitted). 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Matters related to the credibility of witnesses and the
weight to be given to the evidence are generally left to thefactfinder.  The appellate court will neither reconcileconflicting evidence nor interfere with the decision of thetrier of fact based on the witnesses' credibility or theweight of the evidence. 
State v. Mitchell, 94 Hawai# i 388, 393, 15 P.3d 314, 319 
(App. 2000) (citations omitted). 
HRS § 291E-61 provides, in relevant part: 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle
under the influence of an intoxicant if the person operatesor assumes actual physical control of a vehicle: 
(1) While under the influence of alcohol in an amount sufficient to impair the person's normalmental faculties or ability to care for theperson and guard against casualty[.] 
There was substantial evidence at trial to support the 
conclusion that Jenkins operated a vehicle while under the 
influence of alcohol in an amount sufficient to impair her normal 
mental faculties or ability to care for herself and guard against 
casualty.  Honolulu Police Department (HPD) officer Albert 
Ah Yuen testified that on June 28, 2014, he was assigned to 
respond to the scene of a motor vehicle collision at Kamehameha 
Highway and Wilikina Drive.  He arrived at the scene at about 
1:00 a.m.  He saw that Kamehameha Highway was being restriped. 
He saw a red car in the lane that was blocked off, behind the 
vehicle of a special duty officer who was working at the site. 
Traffic cones were under the car's front bumper.  The bumper was 
dented and scratched.  Steam was coming from the engine 
compartment.  Jenkins was sitting in the driver's seat and she 
had a fresh open wound by her eye.   Officer Ah Yuen noticed "a 
strong odor of alcohol . . . coming from [Jenkins'] mouth when she spoke."  Jenkins had "red glassy eyes, watery." 3
3 "[A] person may be proven to be a driver based on 'reasonable
inferences drawn from circumstantial evidence.'"  State v. Brown, 97 Hawai #i 
323, 333, 37 P.3d 572, 582 (App. 2001) (citation omitted). 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Officer Ah Yuen had Jenkins perform a standardized 
field sobriety test (SFST).4  Jenkins swayed while being 
instructed on the walk-and-turn test, trying to keep her balance. 
She started walking before being instructed to begin.  She missed 
all of the heel-to-toe steps, in both directions.  On the one-leg 
stand test, Jenkins swayed throughout the test, trying to keep 
her balance.  She was instructed and shown to keep one foot six 
inches above the ground, but she only lifted her foot two or 
three inches and she put her foot down twice.  Officer Ah Yuen 
arrested her for OVUII. 
HPD officer Edward Belcher testified that he was 
dispatched to the accident scene.  When he arrived he saw "a 
reddish-orangish color" vehicle with severe front-end damage. 
Traffic cones were scattered around, some under the car.  An 
arrow board had also been severely damaged and knocked over, and 
was behind the car.  The arrow board was twelve or thirteen feet 
high and four to five feet wide.  Officer Belcher saw a fresh 
open wound above Jenkins' right eye.  Jenkins' eyes were 
bloodshot and watery.  There was a strong odor of alcohol. 
Jenkins' speech was slurred. 
Because we hold that the District Court did not engage 
Jenkins in a sufficient Tachibana colloquy and that there was 
substantial evidence to support the finding that Jenkins operated 
a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol in an amount 
4 Jenkins contends that Officer Ah Yuen had no present recollection
of her performance on the SFST, but Officer Ah Yuen testified that his memory
was refreshed after reviewing his report.  The District Court denied Jenkins' motion to strike Officer Ah Yuen's testimony, indicating that the DistrictCourt found that Officer Ah Yuen's testimony that his memory was refreshed wascredible, and that Officer Ah Yuen had a present recollection of Jenkins'performance.  We accept the trial court's assessment of witness credibility. Mitchell, 94 Hawai #i at 393, 15 P.3d at 319. 
Jenkins also contends that the State failed to lay foundation for
eliciting Officer Ah Yuen's testimony about Jenkins' performance on the SFST,primarily citing State v. Toyomura, 80 Hawai #i 8, 904 P.2d 893 (1995) and
State v. Nishi, 9 Haw. App. 516, 852 P.2d 476 (1993).  Officer Ah Yuen was not asked about Jenkins' performance on the horizontal gaze nystagmus test.  His testimony about Jenkins' performance on the walk-and-turn and one-leg standtests and her arrest was properly admitted.  State v. Ferrer, 95 Hawai‘i 409, 429, 23 P.3d 744, 764 (App. 2001). 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
sufficient to impair her normal mental faculties or ability to 
care for herself and guard against casualty, the Judgment is 
vacated and this case is remanded to the District Court for a new 
trial.
