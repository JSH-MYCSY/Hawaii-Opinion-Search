APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 93-3974-10)

 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
jurisdiction over this appeal by Defendant-Appellant Michael
 
Bornemann (Appellant) because the Circuit Court of the First
 
1
Circuit (circuit court)  has not reduced its dispositive rulings
on substantive claims to a separate, appealable, final judgment,
 as Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2015)
 
and Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP)

 The Honorable Rhonda A. Nishimura presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
require for an appeal from a civil circuit court case under the 
holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai 'i 
115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
Under Hawai 'i law, "[a]ppeals shall be allowed in civil 
matters from all final judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit . . . courts[.]" HRS § 641-1(a). Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c) (1993). HRCP Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." "An appeal may be taken from circuit court orders resolving claims against parties only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 
Hawai
'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. "Thus, based on Jenkins and 
HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai
'i 245, 
195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008); Bailey v. DuVauchelle, 135 Hawai 'i 
482, 489, 353 P.3d 1024, 1031 (2015). 
The Hawai 'i Supreme Court has held that a final 
judgment in a case involving multiple claims or parties "(a) must specifically identify the party or parties for and against whom the judgment is entered, and (b) must (i) identify the claims for which it is entered, and (ii) dismiss any claims not specifically identified[.]" Jenkins, 76 Haw. at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 
(emphasis added). "If the circuit court intends that claims other than those listed in the judgment language should be dismissed, it must say so; for example, . . . 'all other claims, 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
counterclaims, and cross-claims are dismissed.'" Id. at 119-20 
n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4. 
When interpreting the requirements for a judgment under 
HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai 'i noted: 
If we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
 
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality, . . . and we should not make such searches
necessary by allowing the parties the option of waiving the
requirements of HRCP [Rule] 58.
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. 
This case involves multiple claims: Counts One, Two, 
Three, and Four in Plaintiffs-Appellees Benjamin Paul Kekona and 
Tamae M. Kekona's (collectively, Appellees Kekona's) Verified 
Complaint and two claims in a Counterclaim submitted by 
Defendants-Appellees Paz Feng Abastillas, also known as Paz A. Richter (Appellee Abastillas); Defendants-Appellees/Counterclaim 
Plaintiffs Robert A. Smith, personally, Robert A. Smith, Attorney 
at Law, a Law Corporation (collectively, Appellee Smith); and 
Appellant. The Consolidated Amended Amended Revised Final 
Judgment enters judgment in favor of Plaintiffs-Appellees Tamae Kekona, individually, and Tamae Kekona, as duly-appointed Personal Representative of the Estate of Benjamin Paul Kekona, and against Appellees Abastillas and Smith, and Appellant; and states that "[a]ny remaining parties and/or claims are hereby dismissed," which satisfies the requirement set forth in Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4. 
However, the Consolidated Amended Amended Revised Final
 
Judgment does not specifically identify the claim or claims on
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
which the circuit court intends to enter judgment; and, 
therefore, does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable, final judgment under HRS § 641-1(a), HRCP Rule 58, and the holding in Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. 
Absent an appealable, final judgment, this court lacks
 
jurisdiction over the appeal. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellate No.
 
CAAP-16-0000122 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
