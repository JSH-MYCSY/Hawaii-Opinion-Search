AMENDED SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant OneWest Bank, F.S.B. (OneWest
 
Bank), appeals from the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit's
 
(Circuit Court)1 September 22, 2015 "Order Denying Plaintiff
 
OneWest Bank's Motion for an Order (1) Vacating Order Confirming

 to Plaintiff's Credit Bid Deposit; (3) Reopening Bid at Hearing

Bid Amount; (5) for Other HRCP Rule 60(b) Relief; Alternatively
 
(6) Instructing Commissioner to Conduct a New Auction, Filed May
 21, 2015" (Order Denying the Rule 60(b) Motion). OneWest Bank
 
also challenges the Circuit Court's February 12, 2016 order
 
denying reconsideration of the Order Denying the Rule 60(b)
 Motion (Order Denying Reconsideration).
 
On appeal, OneWest Bank raises four points of error,
 
arguing that the Circuit Court: (1) erred in entering the Order
 Denying the Rule 60(b) Motion and/or the Order Denying
 Reconsideration because the Order Denying the Rule 60(b) Motion
 was void and entered in violation of OneWest Bank's right to due
 process; (2) erred in entering the Order Denying the Rule 60(b)
 Motion and the Order Denying Reconsideration because the Circuit
 Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction (in the underlying
 foreclosure action) to award damages to Defendant-Appellee the
 Association of Owners of the Kumulani at the Uplands at Mauna Kea
 (Association) and, alternatively, because the Association
 
presented no evidence of damages caused by OneWest Bank's failure
 
to complete the foreclosure sale; (3) abused its discretion in
 entering the Order Denying Reconsideration, for various reasons;
 and (4) erred in entering a final judgment.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve OneWest Bank's points of error as follows:
 
(1) OneWest Bank argues that the Circuit Court erred
 
in the Order Denying the Rule 60(b) Motion because OneWest Bank
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
was entitled to post-judgment relief pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of 
Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 60(b)(1), (b)(4), and (b)(6). 
OneWest Bank sought relief from parts of both: (1) the Circuit 
Court's June 3, 2014 Judgment (Judgment on Foreclosure Decree), 
which was entered pursuant to the Circuit Court's June 3, 2014 
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Order Granting [OneWest Bank's] Motion for Entry of Default Judgment . . .; for Summary Judgment Against [the Association]; for an Order for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure and for Entry of Final Judgment Pursuant to [HRCP] 54(b) (Foreclosure Decree); and (2) 
the Circuit Court's March 27, 2015 Final Judgment (Judgment on Confirmation Order), which was entered pursuant to the March 6, 2015 Circuit Court's Order Granting Plaintiff's Second Motion for 
Order Confirming Foreclosure Sale, Approving Commissioner's Report, Allowance of Commissioner's Fees, Attorney's Fees, Costs, and Directing Conveyance (Confirmation Order). 
As previously stated in this court's July 13, 2016
 
Order Regarding May 12, 2016 Motion to Determine Appellate
 Jurisdiction (Order Regarding Appellate Jurisdiction), no party
 
filed a notice of appeal, or a tolling motion, from either the
 
Judgment on Foreclosure Decree or the Judgment on Confirmation
 Order; nor did any party file a notice of appeal from the Circuit
 Court's July 24, 2015 post-judgment Order Granting in Part and
 Denying in Part [the Association's] Motion for Order to Show

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Cause and for Civil Contempt and for Other Relief (Order on
 
Motion to Show Cause).2
 
HRCP Rule 60(b)(1): OneWest Bank argues that the
 
"Circuit Court abused its discretion in denying reconsideration
 
based on mistake, inadvertence, and excusable neglect." Although
 OneWest Bank references HRCP Rule 60(b)(6), the gravamen of this
 argument is that the Circuit Court erred by denying its HRCP Rule
 60(b) motion for relief from the Judgment on Foreclosure Decree
 and the Judgment on Confirmation Order pursuant to HRCP Rule
 60(b)(1). HRCP Rule 60(b)(1) permits a court to relieve a party
 from a final judgment or final order because of mistake,
 inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. "A party cannot
 have relief under 60(b)(1) merely because he is unhappy with the
 judgment. Instead he must make some showing of why he was
 justified in failing to avoid mistake or inadvertence." Joaquin
 
v. Joaquin, 5 Haw. App. 435, 443, 698 P.2d 298, 304 (1985)
 (brackets omitted) (quoting 11 Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R.
 Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure, § 2858 (1st ed. 1973)).
 
OneWest Bank asserts that it was entitled to relief
 
because it did not "realize its debt was fixed" by the
 Foreclosure Decree, and it faults the fact that the Circuit
 Court's January 13, 2015 order on OneWest Bank's motion to re­open bidding "made no mention of limiting [OneWest Bank's]
 credit-bid amount or that [OneWest Bank's] debt was fixed at any
 
2
 The motion seeking HRCP Rule 60(b) relief was filed prior to and
did not seek relief from the Order on Motion to Show Cause. The motion for
 
reconsideration of the Order Denying the Rule 60(b) Motion did not seek relief
from the Order on Motion to Show Cause.
 
4
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
amount[.]" Upon review of the record, it is simply not plausible
 
that OneWest Bank was "unaware" that the Foreclosure Decree
 limited its debt amount. We conclude that this argument is
 inconsistent with the record in this case and that it is without
 merit. 
Most notably, the Foreclosure Decree, which set forth
 
the limitation, was drafted by OneWest Bank's (prior) attorney,
 who also represented OneWest Bank at the September 26, 2013
 hearing where the Circuit Court orally ruled that OneWest Bank
 was limited to "interest at a rate of 7 percent for a period of
 24 months and no additional interest" and was "barred from
 collection of any escrow advances and taxes, property
 preservation fees, property inspection fees, BPO and appraisal
 fees[.]" At subsequent hearings, where OneWest Bank was
 represented by its current counsel, the court and the parties
 again referenced OneWest Bank's recovery as being capped at
 $581,972.26. Specifically, at the October 31, 2014 hearing on
 OneWest Bank's motion to re-open bidding, the Circuit Court
 explicitly stated before OneWest Bank's current counsel, "[t]he
 Court has already, in this case, cut off interest to the bank
 from at least the date of the motion for summary judgment, and so
 the – there's not further damage to the borrower, in terms of a
 deficiency judgment, by the delay." (Emphasis added). At the
 February 9, 2015 hearing on OneWest Bank's motion to confirm,
 counsel for OneWest Bank specifically acknowledged that it bid
 several hundred thousand dollars over the debt owed to OneWest
 Bank and even presented argument as to the distribution of excess
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
proceeds. The Confirmation Order again specifically stated that
 
the amounts due OneWest Bank total $581,972.26 and that OneWest
 Bank is not entitled to any further interest, attorney's fees, or
 costs.
 
Thus, OneWest Bank had actual notice at every stage of
 
the proceedings leading up to the entry of the Foreclosure
 Decree, the Judgment on Foreclosure Decree, the Confirmation
 Order, and the Judgment on Confirmation Order that its recovery
 was limited to $581,972.26 and that its bid of $815,098.42 would
 result in an amount in excess of its debt, and that, as stated in
 the Confirmation Order, the surplus would be payable to the
 Association (in the amount of $116,011.95 for, inter alia,
 outstanding maintenance fees) and to Defendant-Appellee Diana G.
 Brown, after settlement of various other amounts. Moreover,
 there is no cogent argument concerning OneWest Bank's failure to
 timely appeal the Judgment on Foreclosure Decree and/or the
 Judgment on Confirmation Order. Based on the record in this
 case, we cannot conclude that the Circuit Court erred in denying
 HRCP Rule 60(b)(1) relief from the Judgment on Foreclosure Decree
 and the Judgment on Confirmation Order.
 
HRCP Rule 60(b)(4): OneWest Bank argues that the
 
Confirmation Order was void and entered in violation of OneWest
 Bank's constitutional right to due process. OneWest Bank
 contends that "[t]he [Association]'s failure to plead, serve and
 prove its lien priority rendered the Circuit Court powerless to
 grant the [Association] any affirmative relief including that the
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Owner owed it $116,011.95 in unpaid dues and that $81,509.84 must
 
be paid by [OneWest Bank] to the [Association]."
 
"[A] judgment is void only if the court that rendered 
it lacked jurisdiction of either the subject matter or the parties or otherwise acted in a manner inconsistent with due process of law." Cvitanovich-Dubie v. Dubie, 125 Hawai' i 128, 
139, 254 P.3d 439, 450 (2011) (quoting In re Hana Ranch Co., 3 Haw. App. 141, 146, 642 P.2d 938, 941 (1982)). This court has held: 
Determining whether a judgment is void is not a matter
of discretion under HRCP Rule 60(b)(4). "In the sound
 
interest of finality, the concept of void judgment must be
narrowly restricted." Accordingly, "if a court has the
general power to adjudicate the issues in the class of suits
to which the case belongs then its interim orders and final
judgments, whether right or wrong, are not subject to
collateral attack, so far as jurisdiction over the subject
matter is concerned."
 
Dillingham Inv. Corp. v. Kunio Yokoyama Tr., 8 Haw. App. 226,
 
233–34, 797 P.2d 1316, 1319–20 (1990) (citations omitted) (first
 citing Hana Ranch, 3 Haw. App. at 146, 642 P.2d at 941; then
 quoting 7 J. Moore & J. Lucas, Moore's Federal Practice
 ¶ 60.25[2], at 60–225, 229-30 (2d ed. 1990)).
 
OneWest Bank argues that the supreme court's holding in
 
Powers v. Ellis, 56 Haw. 587, 588, 545 P.2d 1173, 1174 (1976), is
 controlling. There, the supreme court held: 
Defenses to the foreclosure complaint are required to be
pleaded by such junior lienor defendants and are adjudicated
by the decree of foreclosure. The claims of such junior
lienors to any surplus remaining after satisfaction of the
senior mortgage, on the other hand, are to be pleaded as
pure cross claims pursuant to HRCP Rule 13(g). 
However, OneWest Bank does not cite any authority
 
indicating that, even assuming a party's non-compliance with HRCP
 
Rule 13(g), or any of the other numerous provisions that OneWest
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Bank cites on appeal,3 the Circuit Court is deprived of subject
 
matter jurisdiction over the distribution of proceeds from the
 
foreclosure sale, and we find none. On the contrary, in several
 cases cited by OneWest Bank, the supreme court held that even
 where the circuit court lacked, or exceeded, its authority
 pursuant to a procedural rule, there was no impact on the court's
 jurisdiction. 
Specifically, in In re Genesys Data Technologies, Inc., 
95 Hawai' i 33, 38, 18 P.3d 895, 900 (2001), one issue on appeal 
was whether a default judgment was void because it awarded the plaintiff damages that exceeded the amount pled in the complaint in violation of HRCP Rule 54(c). Regarding subject matter jurisdiction, the supreme court stated, "[t]here is no indication that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter or the parties in this case[,]" and turned to the parties' arguments regarding due process. Id. In another case OneWest 
Bank cites, Fujii v. Osborne, 67 Haw. 322, 330-31, 687 P.2d 1333, 1339-40 (1984), the supreme court held that the trial court "had no authority to enter the default" under HRCP Rule 55(a) where no such relief was sought, but nonetheless concluded that the trial court "had jurisdiction of the parties, and of the subject property[.]" In re Genesys Data and Fujii evidence that a trial 
court's actions that violate procedural rules or exceed its

 OneWest Bank argues that the Association "was statutorily required
to follow foreclosure procedures in order to collect on the past-due amounts
from surplus proceeds from the foreclosure sale," citing HRS § 514B-146.
OneWest Bank also cites to HRCP Rules 3, 4, 5, 7, 8(a), 15, 39, 56(a)-(b),
without expressly arguing that any of these provisions were violated. 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
authority to grant relief do not necessarily implicate the
 
court's subject matter jurisdiction.
 
Here, although stated as an affirmative defense, in its
 
Answer to OneWest Bank's Complaint, the Association did in fact
 plead that it has a statutory lien for certain assessed but
 unpaid sums and that it had recorded a Notice of Lien, and its
 prayer for relief includes a request that the court determine the
 priority of the parties' claims. Liberally construed, it appears
 that the Association's Answer states a cross-claim for the
 payment of its assessments from the proceeds of the sale of the
 subject property. See, e.g., Ryan v. Herzog, SCWC-13-0000595,
 
2018 WL 2127079 at *8 (May 9, 2018) (designated for publication)
 (holding that a tenant's answer to the complaint, when "liberally
 construed," included an "implicit" counterclaim for retaliatory
 eviction). OneWest Bank provides no authority that due to
 alleged errors in the form of pleading, which alleged errors were
 not raised prior to the Circuit Court's entry of the Judgment on
 the Confirmation Order, the Circuit Court lacked jurisdiction to
 determine the amounts due to the Association from the sale of the
 subject property, and we find none. Therefore, we conclude that
 the Circuit Court did not err or abuse its discretion in denying
 HRCP Rule 60(b)(4) relief from the Judgment on Confirmation
 Order.
 
HRCP Rule 60(b)(6): OneWest Bank asserts that the
 
Circuit Court erred and/or abused its discretion in the
 application of the doctrine of laches in the Foreclosure Decree,
 which the court later referred to as unclean hands stemming from
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
OneWest Bank's various dilatory actions, in the Order Denying
 
Rule 60(b) Motion. OneWest Bank argues, in essence, that it is
 entitled to extraordinary relief pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b)(6),
 as it did not appeal from the Judgment on the Foreclosure Decree. 
This argument is without merit.
 
"[A] party seeking relief under HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) 
after the time for appeal has run 'must establish the existence of "extraordinary circumstances" that prevented or rendered him unable to prosecute an appeal.'" Citicorp Mortg., Inc. v. 
Bartolome, 94 Hawai' i 422, 436, 16 P.3d 827, 841 (App. 2000) 
(quoting Hana Ranch, 3 Haw. App. at 147, 642 P.2d at 942); see also Stafford v. Dickison, 46 Haw. 52, 57 n.4, 374 P.2d 665, 669 n.4 (1962) ("[A] motion under Rule 60(b) is not a substitute for
 a timely appeal from the original judgment." (citation omitted)). 
Here, OneWest Bank fails to identify any circumstances that
 prevented it from filing a timely notice of appeal from the
 Judgment on Foreclosure Decree to challenge the application of
 laches to the amount of its mortgage in the Foreclosure Decree,
 let alone extraordinary ones. Nor does OneWest Bank explain how
 the Circuit Court's reference to "unclean hands" in the Order
 Denying Rule the 60(b) Motion, even if erroneous, entitles it to
 relief under HRCP Rule 60(b)(6), and we find none. Moreover, we
 cannot conclude, based on the record in this case and the
 arguments made, that the Circuit Court abused its discretion in
 characterizing OneWest Bank as having unclean hands in its
 conduct of these foreclosure proceedings. 
10
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Thus, for these reasons, we conclude that the Circuit
 
Court did not err in denying OneWest Bank's request for relief
 
pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b)(1), (4), and (6).
 
(2) OneWest Bank further argues, however, that the
 
Circuit Court erred in entering damages awards against OneWest
 Bank in the Order Denying Rule 60(b) Motion. This argument has
 merit.
 
As OneWest Bank acknowledges, this court has held that
 
a successful bidder at a judicial foreclosure sale submits
 himself or herself to the jurisdiction of the circuit court and
 is subject to subsequent enforcement orders by the circuit court
 upon entry of an order confirming the sale. First Hawaiian Bank
 
v. Timothy, 96 Hawai' i 348, 357, 31 P.3d 205, 214 (App. 2001) 
(explaining, "[s]ince Hayashi bid on the subject property and his bid was accepted by the circuit court when it entered the Order Confirming Sale, Hayashi submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the circuit court and was subject to subsequent enforcement orders by the circuit court"); see also HRS § 603-21.7(1)(c) (2016) (circuit courts have jurisdiction in actions or proceedings "for the foreclosure of mortgages"); HRS § 603­21.9(1) (2016) (circuit courts also have the power "[t]o make and issue all orders and writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their original or appellate jurisdiction[.]"). 
In this case, the issue of OneWest Bank's potential
 
liability for damages was before the Circuit Court in conjunction
 with the Association's post-judgment motion that resulted in the
 July 24, 2015 Order on Motion to Show Cause, which is not before
 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the court on this appeal. However, the issue of the amount of
 
damages incurred by the Association was not properly before the
 Circuit Court in conjunction with OneWest Bank's post-judgment
 motion for HRCP Rule 60(b) relief from the Judgment on
 Foreclosure Decree and the Judgment on Confirmation Order, as
 there were no damages awarded against OneWest Bank in those
 judgments, or their respective underlying orders. OneWest Bank's
 motion sought to limit the amount forfeited from its credit bid
 deposit. Thus, we conclude that the Circuit Court erred in the
 Order Denying the Rule 60(b) Motion, in finding that OneWest Bank
 is liable for payment of damages to the Association, and that the
 Association has incurred damages in a certain amount, and
 ordering OneWest Bank to pay damages to the Association.
4 Thus,
 
paragraphs e. and g., on page 3, and paragraph 9., on page 4, of
 the Order Denying the Rule 60(b) Motion must be stricken.
5
 
(3) OneWest Bank further argues that the Circuit Court 
abused its discretion in denying its motion for reconsideration. However, except as to the issue of damages, it appears that OneWest Bank simply reargued the merits of the Rule 60(b) motion without identifying any new evidence or arguments that "could not have been presented during the earlier adjudicated motion." Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Wailea Elua v. Wailea Resort Co., Ltd, 100 Hawai' i 97, 110, 58 P.3d 608, 621 (2002) (citation 
4
 OneWest Bank does not challenge the Circuit Court's order that
OneWest Bank pay $8.00 to Old Republic Title & Escrow for escrow fees.
 
5
 This ruling should not be construed as a ruling on the merits of
an award of damages against OneWest Bank and is without prejudice to any
relief granted in conjunction with the Order on Motion to Show Cause or any
other such proceedings.
 
12
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
omitted); see also Cho v. State, 115 Hawai' i 373, 384, 168 P.3d 
17, 28 (2007) ("Reconsideration is not a device to relitigate old
 
matters or to raise arguments or evidence that could and should
 have been brought during the earlier proceeding." (citation
 omitted)). Therefore, except to the extent that it addresses the
 issue of OneWest Bank's liability for damages, which is addressed
 above, we conclude that OneWest Bank is not entitled to relief
 from the Circuit Court's Order Denying Reconsideration.
 
(3) OneWest Bank argues that the Circuit Court erred
 
in entering a final judgment on the Confirmation Order and,
 accordingly, the Circuit Court erred and/or abused its discretion
 in denying relief from the Judgment on Confirmation Order.
 Notably, OneWest Bank does not state what part of HRCP Rule 60(b)
 authorizes such relief, in the absence of a timely appeal. HRS
 § 641-1(a) (2016) authorizes appeals "in civil matters from all
 final judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit and district
 courts and the land court[.]" In foreclosure actions, appeals
 are also authorized by HRS § 667-51 (2016) as follows:
 
§ 667-51. Appeals. (a) Without limiting the class of
orders not specified in section 641-1 from which appeals may
also be taken, the following orders entered in a foreclosure
case shall be final and appealable:
(1)	 A judgment entered on a decree of foreclosure,
and if the judgment incorporates an order of
sale or an adjudication of a movant's right to a
deficiency judgment, or both, then the order of
sale or the adjudication of liability for the
deficiency judgment also shall be deemed final
and appealable;
(2)	 A judgment entered on an order confirming the
sale of the foreclosed property, if the circuit
court expressly finds that no just reason for
delay exists, and certifies the judgment as
final pursuant to rule 54(b) of the Hawaii rules
of civil procedure; and
(3)	 A deficiency judgment; provided that no appeal
from a deficiency judgment shall raise issues
relating to the judgment debtor's liability for
the deficiency judgment (as opposed to the
 
13
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
amount of the deficiency judgment), nor shall
the appeal affect the finality of the transfer
of title to the foreclosed property pursuant to
the order confirming sale.
 
Both HRS §§ 667-51(b) and 641-1(c) require an appeal to
 
"be taken in the manner and within the time provided by the rules
 
of court." 
"Under HRS § 667-51, foreclosure cases are bifurcated
 
into two separately appealable parts: (1) the decree of
 foreclosure and order of sale appealable pursuant to HRS
 § 667-51(a)(1); and (2) all other orders that 'fall within the
 second part of the bifurcated proceedings.'" Bank of Am., N.A.
 
v. Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai' i 361, 372, 390 P.3d 1248, 1259 (2017) 
(quoting Mortg. Elec. Registration Sys., Inc. v. Wise, 130 Hawai'i 11, 16, 304 P.3d 1192, 1197 (2013)). Where no timely 
appeal is taken from a final judgment, it becomes "final and binding." Wise, 130 Hawai' i at 17, 304 P.3d at 1198. Once the 
Circuit Court enters a final judgment, it lacks authority to reconsider any interlocutory orders preceding that judgment, absent authority under an applicable rule such as HRCP Rule 60(b) or Rule 59(e). See Cho, 115 Hawai' i at 384, 168 P.3d at 28 ("the 
trial court possesses the inherent power to reconsider its initial [interlocutory] sanctions order at any time prior to the entry of final judgment." (Emphasis added)). Specific to foreclosure proceedings, the supreme court has stated: 
A litigant who wishes to challenge a decree of foreclosure
and order of sale may—and, indeed, must—do so within the
thirty day period following entry of the decree or will lose
the right to appeal that portion of the foreclosure
proceeding. Additionally, the litigant who does not timely
challenge the circuit court's ruling accompanying a
foreclosure decree that also determines the mortgagee's
right to a deficiency judgment forfeits appellate review of
the circuit court's determination of liability  for the
 
14
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
deficiency judgment, although the litigants may still
challenge the amount of the deficiency following subsequent
entry of final orders in the proceedings.
 
Beneficial Hawaii, Inc. v. Casey, 98 Hawai' i 159, 165, 45 P.3d 
359, 365 (2002) (underlined emphasis added) (citations omitted). 
Here, the Judgment on Foreclosure Decree was
 
immediately appealable pursuant to HRS § 667-51(a)(1) because it
 
was a judgment entered on a foreclosure decree. 
The final judgment pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a) was the 
Judgment on Confirmation Order. The Confirmation Order was the last and final order that "collectively embraced the entire controversy" because the sale did not result in a deficiency and the Confirmation Order provided complete directions as to the distribution of proceeds from the sale. Therefore, there was nothing further to adjudicate. Because this case involves one cause of action and the Judgment on Confirmation Order enters judgment as to all named parties, it complied with HRCP Rule 58 and Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 
119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). OneWest Bank's failure to timely appeal from the Judgment on Confirmation Order precludes our review of this second and final portion of the proceedings and all preceding interlocutory orders, including the Confirmation Order. 
Finally, in this court's July 13, 2016 Order Regarding
 
Appellate Jurisdiction, we stated in footnote six that "[t]o the
 extent that Appellant OneWest Bank's October 2, 2015
 post-judgment motion sought HRCP Rule 60(b) reconsideration of
 the July 24, 2015 post-judgment order, that post-judgment motion
 
15
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
cannot be considered a tolling motion for reconsideration under
 
HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). . . ." Upon further review of the post-
judgment record, it is clear that OneWest Bank did not, in the
 October 2, 2015 motion for reconsideration, seek reconsideration
 of the Order on Motion to Show Cause. We also stated that
 "Appellant OneWest is not entitled to appellate review of the
 related [Order on Motion to Show Cause], because Appellant
 OneWest Bank's March 1, 2016 notice of appeal is not timely as to
 the [Order on Motion to Show Cause]." However, we hereby clarify
 and amend our July 13, 2016 Order Regarding Appellate
 Jurisdiction to reiterate that the Order on Motion to Show Cause
 is not properly before this court in this appeal, but to state
 that we express no opinion as to whether the Order on Motion to
 Show Cause is a final post-judgment order.
 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's September 22,
 
2015 Order Denying the Rule 60(b) Motion is affirmed in part and
 reversed in part; the Order Denying the Rule 60(b) Motion is
 affirmed, except that paragraphs e. and g., on page 3, and
 paragraph 9., on page 4, of the order are hereby stricken. 
Accordingly, the Circuit Court's February 12, 2016 Order Denying
 Reconsideration is also affirmed in part and denied in part.
