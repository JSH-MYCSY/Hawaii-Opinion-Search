ORDER DISMISSING APPELLATE COURT CASE NUMBER
 
CAAP-16-0000124 FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION

 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
appellate jurisdiction over the appeal of Defendant/
 
Counterclaim-Plaintiff/Appellant Paz Feng Abastillas (Abastillas)
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and Defendant/Counterclaim-Plaintiff/Appellant Robert A. Smith 
(Smith) from the Honorable Rhonda A. Nishimura's February 1, 2016 
Consolidated Amended Amended Revised Final Judgment in favor of 
Plaintiffs/Counterclaim-Defendants/Appellees Tamae Kekona, as Personal Representative of the Estate of Benjamin Paul Kekona and Tamae M. Kekona, Individually (the Kekona Plaintiffs) and against 
Abastillas and Smith, because the February 1, 2016 Consolidated 
Amended Amended Revised Final Judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable final judgment under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2015), Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP), and the holding in 
Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai 'i 115, 119, 
869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals from final judgments, 
orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). HRCP Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." The Supreme Court of Hawai
'i requires that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after 
the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 119, 869 
P.2d at 1338. Furthermore, 
if a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a case involving
multiple claims or multiple parties, the judgment (a) must specifically
identify the party or parties for and against whom the judgment is
entered, and (b) must (i) identify the claims for which it is entered,
and (ii) dismiss any claims not specifically identified[.]
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (emphases added). 
For example: "Pursuant to the jury verdict entered on (date), judgment
in the amount of $___ is hereby entered in favor of Plaintiff X and
 
-2­ 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
against Defendant Y upon counts I through IV of the complaint." . . . .
If the circuit court intends that claims other than those listed in the 
 
judgment language should be dismissed, it must say so: for example,
"Defendant Y's counterclaim is dismissed," or "Judgment upon Defendant
Y's counterclaim is entered in favor of Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z,"
or "all other claims, counterclaims, and cross-claims are dismissed."
 
Id. at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4 (emphasis added). The
 
Supreme Court of Hawai 'i has explained that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face all of the
issues in the case, the burden of searching the often voluminous circuit
court record to verify assertions of jurisdiction is cast upon this
court. Neither the parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this
court the burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality, . . . and we should not make such searches necessary by
allowing the parties the option of waiving the requirements of HRCP
[Rule] 58.
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (citation omitted; 
original emphasis).
 
Although the instant case is a multiple-claim case in
 
which the Kekona Plaintiffs' complaint asserts four separate and
 
distinct counts against the defendants, the February 1, 2016
 Consolidated Amended Amended Revised Final Judgment does not
 specifically identify the counts of the Kekona Plaintiffs'
 complaint on which the circuit court intends to enter judgment in
 favor of the Kekona Plaintiffs and against the defendants. The
 February 1, 2016 Consolidated Amended Amended Revised Final
 Judgment 
does include language stating that "[a]ny remaining
 
parties and/or claims are hereby dismissed," which satisfies the
 following Jenkins requirement:
 
If the circuit court intends that claims other than those listed
 
in the judgment language should be dismissed, it must say so: for
example, "Defendant Y's counterclaim is dismissed," or "Judgment
upon Defendant Y's counterclaim is entered in favor of
Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all other claims,
counterclaims, and cross-claims are dismissed."
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4 
(emphases added).

However, without specifically identifying the claim on
 
which the circuit court intends to enter judgment, the February 1,
 
2016 Consolidated Amended Amended Revised Final Judgment does not
 satisfy the requirements for an appealable final judgment under
 HRS § 641-1(a), HRCP Rule 58, and the holding in Jenkins. Absent
 an appealable final judgment, we lack appellate jurisdiction. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
 
case number CAAP-16-0000124 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
