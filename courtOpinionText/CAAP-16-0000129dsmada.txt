ORDER DISMISSING APPELLATE COURT CASE NUMBER
 
CAAP-16-0000129 FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION

 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record it appears that we lack
 
appellate jurisdiction over Defendant/Counterclaim-Plaintiff/
 
Third-Party Plaintiff/Appellant Hitoshi Yoshikawa's (Appellant
 Yoshikawa) appeal from the Honorable Karen T. Nakasone's
 February 3, 2015 judgment in favor of Plaintiff/Counterclaim­Defendant/Appellee Association of Owners of Kalele Kai (Appellee
 Association of Owners of Kalele Kai), because the February 3,
 2016 judgment neither resolves all claims against all parties nor
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
contains an express finding of no just reason for delay in the 
entry of judgment as to one or more but fewer than all claims or parties pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP), as Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2015) requires under HRCP Rule 54(b), HRCP Rule 58 and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals to the Hawai 'i 
Intermediate Court of Appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). HRCP Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." Based on this requirement under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has held that "[a]n 
appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
Furthermore, 
if a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a case
involving multiple claims or multiple parties, the judgment
(a) must specifically identify the party or parties for and

against whom the judgment is entered, and (b) must (i)
identify the claims for which it is entered, and (ii)dismiss
any claims not specifically identified[.]
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (emphases added). 
For example: "Pursuant to the jury verdict entered on
(date), judgment in the amount of $___ is hereby entered in
favor of Plaintiff X and against Defendant Y upon counts I
through IV of the complaint." . . . . If the circuit court
 intends that claims other than those listed in the judgment
language should be dismissed, it must say so: for example,
"Defendant Y's counterclaim is dismissed," or "Judgment upon
Defendant Y's counterclaim is entered in favor of
 Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all other claims,
counterclaims, and cross-claims are dismissed."

Id. at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4 (emphasis added). 
When interpreting the requirements for an appealable final judgment under HRS § 641-1(a) and HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has explained that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality, . . . and we should not make such searches
necessary by allowing the parties the option of waiving the
requirements of HRCP [Rule] 58.
 
Jenkins,  76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (citation omitted; 
original emphasis). Consequently, "an appeal from any judgment
 
will be dismissed as premature if the judgment does not, on its
 face, either resolve all claims against all parties or contain
 the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." 
Id.
 
The instant case involves three sets of claims:

 
(1) two counts in Appellee Association of Owners of
Kalele Kai's February 20, 2015 first amended
complaint against Appellant Yoshikawa;
 
(2) eleven counts in Appellant Yoshikawa's April 29,
2015 counterclaim against Appellee Association of
Owners of Kalele Kai; and
 
(3) eleven counts in Appellant Yoshikawa's April 29,
2015 third-party complaint (which Appellant
Yoshikawa incorrectly labeled as a "cross-claim")
against Third Party-Defendants/Appellees Bradford
Oakes (Appellee Oakes) and Darla Sabry (Appellee
Sabry).
 
(1)
 The February 3, 2016 judgment enters judgment in favor of
 
Appellee Association of Owners of Kalele Kai and against
 
Appellant Yoshikawa as to all claims in Appellee Association of
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
-4-Owners of Kalele Kai's February 20, 2015 first amended complaint. 
(2) The February 3, 2016 judgment enters judgment in favor ofAppellee Association of Owners of Kalele Kai and againstAppellant Yoshikawa as to all claims in Appellant Yoshikawa'scounterclaim and "cross-claim".  However, as to (3) AppellantYoshikawa's April 29, 2015 third-party complaint (incorrectlylabeled as a "cross-claim") against Appellee Oakes and AppelleeSabry, the February 3, 2016 judgment neither enters judgment onnor dismisses Appellant Yoshikawa's third-party complaint as tothese two parties.  The February 3, 2015 judgment does not evenmention the names of Appellee Oakes and Appellee Sabry, much lessexpressly resolve Appellant Yoshikawa's third-party claims as toAppellee Oakes and Appellee Sabry.
Although the February 3, 2016 judgment does not resolve
Appellant Yoshikawa's third-party claims as to Appellee Oakes and
Appellee Sabry, neither does it contain an express finding of no
just reason for delay in the entry of judgment as to one or more
but fewer than all claims or parties pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b). 
Instead, the February 3, 2016 judgment closes with a statement
that declares that "[t]his Final Judgment resolves and disposes
of all claims asserted by all parties in this action in
accordance with Rule 58 of the Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure." 
As the Supreme Court of Hawai #i has explained,
[a] statement that declares "there are no other outstanding
claims" is not a judgment.  If the circuit court intends
that claims other than those listed in the judgment language
should be dismissed, it must say so: for example,
"Defendant Y's counterclaim is dismissed," or "Judgment upon
Defendant Y's counterclaim is entered in favor of
Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all other claims,
counterclaims, and cross-claims are dismissed."NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4 
(emphases added). 
The February 3, 2016 judgment must either enter
 
judgment on or dismiss all claims as to all parties, including
 
Appellee Oakes and Appellee Sabry, which it does not. Therefore,
 the February 3, 206 judgment does not satisfy the requirements
 for an appealable final judgment under HRS § 641-1(a) (1993 &
 Supp. 2015), HRCP Rule 54(b), HRCP Rule 58 and the holding in
 Jenkins. Absent an appealable final judgment, we lack appellate
 jurisdiction, and Appellant Yoshikawa's appeal is premature. 
Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number
 
CAAP-16-0000129 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
