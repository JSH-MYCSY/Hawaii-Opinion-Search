against Kelly. On appeal, Kelly contends that: (1) the circuit
 
court improperly considered and granted Palehua's request for
 money damages in conjunction with its award of attorneys' fees
 and costs; and (2) the circuit court abused its discretion in
 awarding attorneys' fees against Kelly.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced, applicable authorities, and the issues
 raised, we resolve Kelly's points on appeal as follows:
I.	 The Circuit Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in Granting
Palehua's Request for Attorneys' Fees and Costs
 
We first address Kelly's argument that the circuit 
court improperly considered and granted Palehua's request for 
money damages in its Non-Hearing Motion for Attorneys' Fees, Costs, and Expenses (Non-Hearing Motion for Attorneys' Fees and Costs). We review a motion for attorneys' fees and costs under the "abuse of discretion" standard. Sierra Club v. Dep't of 
Transp., 120 Hawai' i 181, 197, 202 P.3d 1226, 1242 (2009) 
(internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets omitted). 
Kelly argues that Palehua failed to explicitly state,
 
claim, or demand money damages in its Complaint for Declaratory
 and Injunctive Relief, filed September 2, 2011, by failing to
 allege either that Palehua's governing documents constitute a
 contract or that Palehua was damaged by Kelly's actions.
 
When a homeowner fails to bring a property into
 
compliance with a homeowners association's rules, the homeowner
 
2 In her reply brief, Kelly, raised two additional points of error,
alleging: (1) that Kelly was deprived of the due process of law when Palehua
filed a separate "non-hearing motion" for attorneys' fees and costs, ratherthan the court ordered "declaration" of attorneys' fees and costs; and (2)that the circuit court's injunction was unconstitutionally vague because itdid not enumerate the specific actions Kelly was required to take to clean herproperty and because it was filed only four days prior to the deadline forcompliance. Inasmuch as Kelly, who was represented by counsel on appeal,failed to raise such arguments in her opening brief, such arguments are deemedwaived. See Association of Apartment Owners of Newtown Meadows ex rel. its Bd
of Directors v. Venture 15, Inc., 115 Hawai 'i 232, 281 n.39, 167 P.3d 225, 274
n.39 (2007) citing In re Hawaiian Flour Mills, Inc., 76 Hawai 'i 1, 14 n. 5,
868 P.2d 419, 432 n. 5 (1994) (holding that arguments raised for the first
time in the reply brief on appeal were deemed waived).

must pay the association for costs incurred from that failure.
 
See Royal Kunia Community Ass'n ex rel. Bd. of Directors v.
 Nemoto, 119 Hawai' i 437, 445, 198 P.3d 700, 708 (2008) (Royal 
Kunia). Palehua's governing documents
3 require that homeowners
 
pay not only for the enforcement costs associated with bringing
 the property back into compliance, but, additionally, for any
 attorneys' fees and costs associated with the enforcement of the
 covenants.
 
Here, the circuit court entered summary judgment and an
 
injunction in favor of Palehua including, inter alia,
 authorization for Palehua to incur compliance costs if Kelly
 failed to bring the property into compliance. Kelly does not
 dispute that she failed to bring the property into compliance or
 that, as previously authorized by the circuit court, Palehua
 included the costs of compliance in its request for attorneys'
 fees and costs. Thereafter, the circuit court awarded compliance
 costs, including attorneys' fees and costs, as required by the
 Covenants, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 421J-10(a) (2004),
4
 
and as previously ordered by the circuit court. Specifically,
 
3
 Section 7.02 of the Declaration of Covenants, Conditions, and
Restrictions of the Palehua Community (Covenants) states that any "costs of
enforcement, including court costs and attorneys' fees, shall be paid by any
Owner who violated any such limitation, restriction, covenant or condition, or
failed to pay and satisfy when due any such lien or charge."
 
4
 HRS § 421J-10(a) provides:
 
§ 421J-10(a) Attorneys' fees and expenses of enforcement.
(a) All costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees,
incurred by or on behalf of the association for:
(1) 	 Collecting any delinquent assessments against any unit
or the owner of any unit;
(2) 	 Foreclosing any lien on any unit; or
(3)  Enforcing any provision of the association documents
or this chapter; against a member, occupant, tenant, employee of a
member, or any other person who in any manner may use the
property, shall be promptly paid on demand to the association by
such person or persons; provided that if the association is not
the prevailing party, all costs and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, incurred by any such person or persons as a
result of the action of the association, shall be promptly paid on
demand to the person by the association. The reasonableness of
 any attorney's fees paid by a person or by an association as a
result of an action pursuant to paragraph (2) shall be determined
by the court.

the circuit court awarded the following amounts for Palehua's
 
efforts in enforcing the Covenants:
 
Cleaning Costs: $
3,361.46
 
Attorneys' Fees: $10,140.00
 Costs: $1,257.30
 Additional Attorneys' fees and costs to be incurred: $900.00
 Total Judgment Amount: $15,658.76.
 
As discussed above, the "Cleaning Costs" were incurred
 
by Palehua when it conducted the clean-up of Kelly's property, in
 fulfillment of Covenant obligations and the circuit court's
 injunction, after Kelly refused to comply with the injunction.
 The "Attorney's Fees," "Costs," and "Additional Attorneys' fees
 and costs to be incurred" were or will be incurred by Palehua in
 the course of maintaining the present action to obtain the
 injunction to enforce the Covenants. All of these costs of
 enforcement are authorized by the Covenants and the HRS, and
 Kelly is liable for these costs of enforcement. Accordingly, the
 circuit court did not abuse its discretion when granting
 attorneys' fees and costs to Palehua.
 
Kelly further argues that the circuit court improperly 
considered Palehua's Non-Hearing Motion for Attorneys' Fees and Costs as a non-hearing motion when such a request cannot be categorized as a non-hearing motion under the Rules of the Circuit Courts of the State of Hawai' i (RCCH) Rule 7.2 and Civil 
Administrative Orders 9.1, 9.2, and 9.9. 
Pursuant to RCCH Rule 7.2(b), motions defined in 
Exhibit B to the RCCH can be considered non-hearing motions, including both motions for "Attorney's Fees" and for "Reimbursement of Out-of-Pocket Expenses." Further, all Civil Administrative Orders were rescinded by order of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Hawai' i on June 9, 2010, prior to 
the commencement of this action, and have no authority.

Thus, Palehua's Non-Hearing Motion for Attorneys' Fees
 
and Costs, which only sought reimbursement for out-of-pocket
 
compliance expenses on behalf of Palehua, and attorneys' fees and
 costs of suit, was a proper non-hearing motion.
 
Finally, Kelly argues that the grant of compensatory
 
damages against Kelly was preserved for appeal because it
 constituted plain error. As we addressed the issue on the merits
 above, we need not address the issue of plain error.
II.	 The Necessity of the Original Law Suit Is Not at Issue on
Appeal - Only the Resulting Attorneys' Fees and Costs
 
Kelly's second point on appeal is that the circuit
 
court abused its discretion in awarding attorneys' fees against
 
Kelly when "the lawsuit [] filed against her was entirely
 unnecessary." Kelly argues that because Palehua is permitted
 under its Covenants to enforce the Covenants, remedy any
 violations, maintain the properties in Palehua, and charge any
 costs directly to the homeowners, that there was no need for
 Palehua to file the present lawsuit. Thus, Kelly concludes, it
 was an abuse of discretion for the circuit court to award
 attorneys' fees for prosecution of an unnecessary lawsuit.
 
The necessity of the lawsuit is not at issue on appeal.
 
Kelly does not dispute that the Covenants and HRS § 421J-10(a)
 both authorize a grant of attorneys' fees and costs for actions
 taken in enforcing the Covenants. Kelly does not dispute the
 reasonableness of the amount of the attorneys' fees and costs.
 Thus, it could not be an abuse of discretion for the circuit
 court to grant attorneys' fees and costs incurred for actions
 taken in enforcing the Covenants.
 
As above, Kelly further argues that this issue is
 
preserved on appeal because it constitutes plain error. Because
 we have addressed the issue on the merits, we need not address
 the issue of plain error.
