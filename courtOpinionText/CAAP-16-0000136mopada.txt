APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 13-1-0283(3))
MEMORANDUM OPINION
(By: Ginoza, C.J., Reifurth and Chan, JJ.)
This is a consolidated appeal arising from a 
judicial foreclosure action in which Defendants-Appellants Dairy
Road Partners ( Dairy Road )1 and Glenn Nakamura ( Nakamura)2
(collectively, Appellants ) appeal from a judgment on a
foreclosure decree, a judgment confirming sale of the subject
property, and a judgment for cancellation of the sale of the
property, entered by the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit
(circuit court).3  Each judgment was entered in favor of
Plaintiff-Appellee Maui Gas Ventures LLC ( Maui Gas Ventures) and
against Dairy Road and Nakamura.
For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.
1  Dairy Road is a Hawai #i limited partnership and the leasehold owner
and operator of the commercial property that is the subject of this
litigation.
2  Nakamura is the general partner of Dairy Road.
3  The Honorable Joseph E. Cardoza presided.

I. CAAP-16-0000136 and CAAP-16-0000516:
Appellants' Motion for Leave to File Counterclaim
In the opening brief for CAAP-16-0000136 and CAAP-16-
0000516, Appellants' point of error asserts that the circuit
court erred in granting summary judgment for Maui Gas Ventures
and confirming the sale of the property, without first granting
them leave to file their proposed Counterclaim against Maui Gas
Ventures under the facts of this case.  Appellants contend that
"a decision on their Counterclaim [was] a precondition to the
entry of any foreclosure decree, . . . thus rendering the
attempted Rule 54(b) certifications of finality by the lower
court [ ] invalid as a matter of law."
American Savings Bank, F.S.B. ( American Savings )
initiated this action in the circuit court by filing a Complaint
for foreclosure on March 4, 2013.4  The Complaint is based on a
Term Loan Agreement and Note from American Savings for a property
on Maui ( subject property ). 
From July 5, 2013 to December 24, 2014, the case was
stayed due to Dairy Road filing for bankruptcy.
After the bankruptcy case was dismissed, Maui Gas
Ventures filed a "Notice and Substitution of [Maui Gas Ventures]
as Real Party in Interest for [American Savings]" ( Notice of
Substitution ) on January 12, 2015, to substitute Maui Gas
Ventures for American Savings as the real party in interest. 
Maui Gas Ventures asserted that it was now the owner of the note
and the real party in interest by way of the Term Loan Agreement,
Promissory Note (Note), and other loan documents dated December
26, 2014.
4  Appellants do not challenge the standing of either American Savings
or Maui Gas Ventures in this case.  Here, American Savings was the original
plaintiff and attached the Note to its Complaint for foreclosure.  The Note
provides that American Savings is the lender and Dairy Road is the borrower.
Further, based on the evidence submitted in support of Maui Gas Ventures's
motion for summary judgment, there is no genuine issue of material fact that
American Savings was the original lender, that American Savings initiated this
action, and that during the course of the action, American Savings sold the
Note to Maui Gas Ventures, which was the owner of the Note at the time summary
judgment was granted to it.
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
On May 14, 2015, Maui Gas Ventures filed its motion for
summary judgment which the circuit court orally granted in a
hearing on August 12, 2015.  On September 29, 2015, the circuit
court entered an order granting summary judgment for Maui Gas
Ventures ( Summary Judgment Order) and a related foreclosure
judgment.5
On October 13, 2015, Appellants filed a motion for
correction and for reconsideration alleging, inter alia , that the
September 29, 2015 Judgment was void because Maui Gas Ventures
had not been properly admitted as a party to the case.  On
October 22, 2015, Maui Gas Ventures filed a motion to substitute
into the case for American Savings as plaintiff ( Motion for
Substitution). 
On December 9, 2015, a hearing was held on Appellants'
motion for correction and reconsideration, as well as Maui Gas
Ventures's Motion for Substitution.  During the hearing on these
motions, Appellants' counsel argued that the circuit court should
not allow the foreclosure in favor of Maui Gas Ventures in part
because that same day, December 9, 2015, Appellants had filed a
motion seeking leave to file a Counterclaim that was "acquired
after pleading."  In brief, Appellants' counsel argued that Maui
Gas Ventures and its principal Paul Cheng ( Cheng) had purported
to work out an agreement with Dairy Road to allow Maui Gas
Ventures to buy out the Note; that Maui Gas Ventures in turn
provided Dairy Road with a series of options (apparently
including options for Dairy Road to buy back the Note); that in
reliance Dairy Road gave Maui Gas Ventures "all kinds of
confidential proprietary information"; that Dairy Road and Maui
Gas Ventures had "agreements all drafted"; and then once Maui Gas
Ventures purchased the Note from American Savings "they didn't
want to talk" to Dairy Road anymore.  Appellants counsel thus
argued that Appellants had claims against Cheng and Maui Gas
5  The Summary Judgment Order was amended on February 3, 2016, by way of
the Amended Summary Judgment Order to designate a new Commissioner in place of
the original Commissioner.

Ventures.  Appellants counsel noted that Appellants were not
asserting a claim against American Savings.
The circuit court thereafter granted Maui Gas
Ventures's Motion for Substitution, noting that it was consistent
with, inter alia , the record in the case, the Notice of
Substitution earlier filed by Maui Gas Ventures, the conduct of
the parties, and that there had never been an objection to the
role of Maui Gas Ventures in the case notwithstanding ample
opportunity to object.  The circuit court also denied Appellants'
motion for correction and for reconsideration, and did not rule
on the request to file a Counterclaim, given that it had just
been filed that day.
In Appellants' "Motion for Leave to File Counterclaim
Acquired After Pleading" ( Motion to File Counterclaim), filed on
December 9, 2015, they sought to file a Counterclaim against Maui
Gas Ventures and a Third-Party Complaint against Cheng, pursuant
to Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 13(e)6 and Rule
15(a).7  Appellants argued that the Counterclaim had not matured
when they initially filed their Answer to the Complaint in 2013. 
On March 30, 2016, the circuit court held a hearing on
Appellants' motion for leave to file the Counterclaim and
expressed that given the status of the case, including that there
was already an appeal pending, and the manner in which the
proposed Counterclaim had been styled and pled, that "the
6  HRCP Rule 13(e) provides: 
(e) Counterclaim maturing or acquired after pleading . A
claim which either matured or was acquired by the pleader
after serving a pleading may, with the permission of the
court, be presented as a counterclaim by supplemental
pleading.
7  Appellants alleged they had an enforceable agreement with Maui Gas
Ventures and Cheng wherein Maui Gas Ventures and Cheng would negotiate and
acquire the subject property from American Savings.  Appellants further
alleged that Maui Gas Ventures and Cheng agreed to purchase the American
Savings' Term Loan Agreement and Note (1) which would enable Appellants an
opportunity to refinance the loan or (2) sell the subject property.  Further,
Appellants alleged that Maui Gas Ventures and Cheng agreed that Appellants
would be able to purchase the loan from Maui Gas Ventures and Cheng with a
premium paid to Maui Gas Ventures and Cheng.
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
appropriate course would be to have this matter filed as a
separate action."  The circuit court thus denied Dairy Road and
Nakamura's motion for leave to file the Counterclaim.  On April
15, 2016, the circuit court entered its "Order Denying
[Appellants'] [Motion to File Counterclaim]."
HRCP Rule 13(e) addresses the filing of a counterclaim
which matured or was acquired by the pleader after the party had
served a pleading.  As set forth expressly in the rule, such a
counterclaim "may, with the permission of the court, be presented
as a counterclaim by supplemental pleading."  We thus review a
trial court's denial of an HRCP Rule 13(e) motion under the abuse
of discretion standard.  Cf. Marks v. Marks, 51 Haw. 548, 563-64,
465 P.2d 996, 1004 (1970) (In reviewing a trial court, "some
discretion is vested in the trial court's hands, for both [HRCP]
Rule 13(f) and 15(a) require leave of court."); Bank of Hawaii v.
Mostoufi, No. CAAP–14–0001073, 2016 WL 3615334, at *2 (Haw. App.
Jun. 30, 2016) (SDO) (determining that a trial court's denial of
an HRCP Rule 13(f) motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion).
Appellants argue that they filed their Motion to File
Counterclaim on December 9, 2015, "three months before summary
judgment on March 14, 2016 was eventually granted by the lower
court." (Emphasis in original).  However, the record shows that
the circuit court granted summary judgment for Maui Gas Ventures
orally on August 12, 2015, and entered its Summary Judgment Order
to that effect on September 29, 2015, both of which occurred
prior to Appellants seeking leave to file the Counterclaim. 
Appellants' argument appears to be referencing that Maui Gas
Ventures subsequently filed its Motion for Substitution, which
was granted on February 3, 2016.  However, as the circuit court
noted, the parties had been treating Maui Gas Ventures as the
relevant party since its Notice of Substitution.
More importantly, as even the Appellants recognized
during the proceedings below, Appellants did not seek to bring
any claim against American Savings.  The Complaint for
foreclosure was based on the Appellants' failure to meet their
6NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
obligations under the loan with American Savings, which is what
prompted the foreclosure action and the basis on which summary
judgment was granted and the foreclosure decree entered.  We
agree with the circuit court that, to the extent the Appellants
believe there was misconduct by Maui Gas Ventures or Cheng after
the foreclosure action was filed, those claims should be brought
in a separate action.
Appellants do not cite any persuasive authority to
support their contention that the Complaint for foreclosure and
their proposed Counterclaim are interrelated to the point that
joint adjudication is mandated.  Rather, given the proceedings
that had occurred prior to the Appellants seeking leave to file
the Counterclaim -- including the circuit court's grant of
summary judgment for Maui Gas Ventures -- and the allegations set
forth in the proposed Counterclaim, the circuit court was within
its discretion to deny the filing of the Counterclaim in this
action.  Although dealing with HRCP Rule 13(f) and not Rule
13(e), we believe Marks provides guidance in this case.  There,
the Hawai #i Supreme Court referenced three cases that affirmed
denials of leave to amend "where the judgment had been announced
or entered before the motion to amend was made."  51 Haw. at 564,
465 P.2d at 1004.  The supreme court noted that "[i]t would seem
sound to take a more critical view of such motions after
decisions are announced."  Id.
Based on the record in this case, we conclude that the
circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying Appellants'
motion for leave to file the Counterclaim. 
II. CAAP-17-0000033
For this appeal, Appellants filed their notice of
appeal from a Judgment cancelling the confirmation of sale, which
was entered on December 23, 2016.  However, in their opening
brief in this appeal (they did not file a reply brief),
Appellants do not assert any particular error related to the
Judgment cancelling the confirmation of sale.  Rather, Appellants
only assert error related to the circuit court's denial of their
7NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
motion seeking leave to file the Counterclaim, which is unrelated
to the Judgment cancelling the confirmation of sale, and in any
event is addressed in CAAP-16-0000136 and CAAP-16-0000516 above. 
We thus conclude that Appellants' appeal in CAAP-17-0000033 lacks
merit.8
III. Conclusion
For the reasons discussed above, the following
judgments, entered by the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit,
are affirmed:
(1) "Judgment Re: Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law,
Order Granting Plaintiff Maui Gas Ventures LLC's Motion for
Summary Judgment As to All Claims and All Parties, for
Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure and Order of Sale, for
Disposal of Personal Property and for Immediate Entry of Money
Judgment Filed May 14, 2015" filed on September 29, 2015;
(2) "Judgment Re: Amended Order Granting Plaintiff Maui
Gas Ventures LLC's Motion for Summary Judgment As to All Claims
and All Parties, for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure and
Order of Sale, for Disposal of Personal Property Filed September
29, 2015" filed on March 14, 2016; 
(3) "Judgment Re: Order Granting Plaintiff Maui Gas
Ventures LLC's Motion for Confirmation of Sale, for Distribution
of Proceeds, for Issuance of Writ of Ejectment/Possession and for
Deficiency Judgment as to Defendant Dairy Road Partners Filed
March 29, 2016" filed on June 21, 2016; and
8  To the extent that Appellants assert in their points of error in
CAAP-17-0000033 that the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment and
confirming the sale without properly marketing the property, and without
holding a new auction, those points are waived.  Points not argued are deemed
waived.  Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure ( HRAP) Rule 28(b)(7); In re

appellant makes no discernible argument in support of that position")
