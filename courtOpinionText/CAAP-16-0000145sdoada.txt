SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Chan, JJ.) 
Plaintiffs-Appellants Dutchie Kapu Saffery (Saffery) 
and Mike Yellen (Yellen) (collectively, Appellants), 
pro se, 
appeal from the Final Judgment entered by the Circuit Court of 
the Third Circuit (Circuit Court)  on March 1, 2016. The Circuit 
Court dismissed the claims against Defendants-Appellees University of Hawai# i, Department of Land and Natural Resources, 
State of Hawai# i, Board of Regents, Office of Mauna Kea 
Management, Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, and Governor David Ige/Predecessor (collectively, the State Defendants) for failure 1

to state a claim for which relief can be granted. The Circuit 
Court also dismissed the claims against Defendants-Appellees President Barack Obama/Predecessor and United States Military (collectively, the Federal Defendants) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The Final Judgment awarded judgment in favor of both State Defendants and Federal Defendants (collectively, Appellees) as to all claims brought against them by Appellants in the First Amended Civil Rights Complaint, filed on November 17, 2015. 
On appeal, Appellants argue one point of error-that the 
Circuit Court erred in dismissing all Appellees.
2 Upon careful 
review of the record and the briefs submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as well as the relevant statutory and case law, we affirm. 
We note that Appellants' opening brief fails to comply 
with the requirements of HRAP Rule 28.  Non-compliance with HRAP 
Rule 28 is sufficient grounds to dismiss this appeal. See HRAP Rule 30 (“When the brief of an appellant is otherwise not in conformity with these rules, the appeal may be dismissed . . . .”). Due to this jurisdiction's policy of "affording litigants the opportunity to have their cases heard on the merits, where possible[,]" however, we nonetheless proceed on the merits. Marvin v. Pflueger, 127 
Hawai# i 490, 496, 280 P.3d 88, 94 (2012)

989–90 (2004)). 3
2 Appellants list a second point of error as follows: "The Circuit
Court error in not exercising it's [sic] authority to stop Appellee's illegal
acts, actions, and inactions." Appellants fail to state any legal basis for this alleged error. We decline to address Appellants' second contended point of error. Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(7). 
3 Among other flaws, the opening brief is devoid of any citations to
the record, the statement of the case is far from concise, and there is nostatement of related cases.

I. State Defendants 
In its order dismissing the State Defendants, the 
Circuit Court concluded that Appellants failed to state claims 
against the State Defendants for which relief can be granted and accordingly granted the State Defendants' motion to dismiss. A circuit court's ruling on a motion to dismiss is reviewed de novo
. See Hungate v. Law Office of David B. Rosen, 139 Hawai# i 
394, 401, 391 P.3d 1, 8 (2017) (quoting Kamaka v. Goodsill Anderson Quinn & Stifel, 117 Hawai# i 92, 104, 176 P.3d 91, 103 
(2008), as amended (Jan. 25, 2008)). Courts must view the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and should dismiss for failure to state a claim only when "it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his or her claim that would entitle him or her to relief."

15, 24, 165 P.3d 916, 925 (2007) (citation omitted). 
Count I of Appellants' First Amended Complaint alleged 
that all state subleases are illegal because they violate the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act (HHCA).
4 Appellants sought the 
following relief: that all State subleases be deemed void, that all telescopes presently on Mauna Kea be immediately removed, that all subleases issued for lands on Mauna Kea be declared in violation of the HHCA, that all land on Mauna Kea be declared sacred land, that Mauna Kea be declared Crown Land, and that the State be enjoined from subleasing any land on Mauna Kea. 
From what we can discern, Appellants' main contention 
in Count I is that the HHCA prohibits lessees of Hawaiian home lands to sublet an interest in the land and that all subleases on

Mauna Kea are therefore in violation of the HHCA.  The Circuit 
Court reviewed HHCA § 203, which designates the "available lands" 
subject to the HHCA; took judicial notice of the fact that the Mauna Kea summit area is not located in the boundaries established by Department of Hawaiian Home Lands (DHHL) maps depicting the lands over which it has jurisdiction; and concluded that the Mauna Kea summit area was not covered by the HHCA. The DHHL maps are a "source[] whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned." See Hawai# i Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 201(b) 
(1980). As such, we conclude that the Circuit Court did not err in taking judicial notice of the fact that the Mauna Kea summit area is not located within the boundaries establishing the areas over which DHHL has jurisdiction. See In re Estate of Herbert, 90 Hawai# i 443, 466, 979 P.2d 39, 62 (1999) ("[T]he taking of 
judicial notice of adjudicative facts by the trial court . . . should be reviewed by an appellate court under the right/wrong standard."). Based on the Circuit Court's review of the DHHL maps and its finding that the Mauna Kea summit area does not fall within the DHHL's boundaries, the Circuit Court correctly concluded that the Mauna Kea summit lands do not fall under the HHCA's jurisdiction and is not subject to the HHCA's provisions. See State v. Puaoi, 78 Hawai# i 185, 188-91, 891 P.2d 272, 275-78 
(1995) (taking judicial notice of venue by referring to maps in a University of Hawai# i publication). We conclude, therefore, that 
Appellants failed to state a claim in Count I for which relief can be granted. 5
Count II of Appellants' First Amended Complaint alleged 
that the State was in violation of the HHCA by leasing State land to lessees who are not Native Hawaiian. Appellants sought to have the State be permanently enjoined from leasing any land that is "designated as Hawaiian Home Land, pursuant to the [HHCA]." 
In arguing that the State leased Hawaiian home lands to

illegal, they do not describe or reference any other specific subleases, aside
from those on Mauna Kea, that they contend to be in violation of the HHCA.

non-Native Hawaiians, Appellants point to the lands on the Mauna 
Kea summit area.  As mentioned in our discussion of Count I, 
supra, the land on Mauna Kea's summit does not fall under the purview of the HHCA. To be subject to the HHCA's mandates, the land in question must be designated Hawaiian home lands. We therefore conclude that those lands on the Mauna Kea summit area were not wrongly leased out to non-Native Hawaiians. There is no claim in Count II for which relief can be granted.

Count IV of Appellants' First Amended Complaint alleged 
that Haw. Exec. Order No. 1719 (Jan. 26, 1956) (Governor's Executive Order), which set aside land now known as the Pohakuloa Training Area for use by the United States military, was unconstitutional and illegal because the Governor of the State of Hawai# i does not have the authority to give land to anyone. 
Appellants seem to be seeking a rescission of the Governor's 
6 As in Count I, the Appellants broadly allege in Count II that the
State leased land to lessees who were not Native Hawaiian. However, the only
piece of land specifically alleged by Appellants to have been wrongly leased tonon-Native Hawaiians is that on Mauna Kea. 
7 To the extent that Appellants seek to enjoin the State from leasing
any land designated as Hawaiian home land to non-Native Hawaiians, this relief isnot available. Section 204(a)(2) of the HHCA states, in relevant part: 
In the management of any retained available lands not requiredfor leasing under section 207(a), the department may dispose
of those lands or any improvements thereon to the public ,
including native Hawaiians, on the same terms, conditions,restrictions, and uses applicable to the disposition of publiclands in chapter 171, Hawaii Revised Statutes; provided thatthe department may not sell or dispose of such lands in feesimple except as authorized under section 205 of this Act;provided further that the department is expressly authorizedto negotiate, prior to negotiations with the general public,the disposition of Hawaiian home lands or any improvementsthereon to a native Hawaiian, or organization or associationowned or controlled by native Hawaiians, for commercial,industrial, or other business purposes, in accordance with theprocedures set forth in chapter 171, Hawaii Revised Statutes;provided further that in addition to dispositions madepursuant to chapter 171, Hawaii Revised Statutes, thedepartment may lease by direct negotiation and at fair marketrents, and for a term not to exceed five years, anyimprovements on Hawaiian home lands, or portions thereof, thatare owned or controlled by the department. 
HHCA  §  2
04(a)(2)  (Supp.  2017)  (emphasis  added).   The  Hawai #i  S upreme  Court  has
clarified  that  this  section  permits  leases  of  "available  lands"  to  the  general
public,  including  the  government  and  its  agencies.   Ahia  v.  Dep't  of  Trans.,  69 
Haw.  538,  544-49,  751  P.2d  81,  85-88  (1988).   Thus,  the  HHCA  does  not  establish  a
complete  bar  to  the  leasing  of  any  Hawaiian  home  land  to  non-Native  Hawaiians.

Executive Order as well as an enjoinment of future executive 
orders that "steal[] land from the Hawaiian people and give[] it to non-Hawaiians." 
Appellants argue that the Governor's Executive Order 
was illegal because at the time it was issued, the land was under the ownership of the United States and the Governor did not have the authority to set the land aside. The Hawai
#i Supreme Court 
has previously discussed the history of the ceded lands in Hawai# i: 
the United States annexed Hawai #i with the passage of the
Newlands Joint Resolution. Joint Resolution To provide for
annexing the Hawaiian Islands to the United States (NewlandsResolution), No. 55, 30 Stat. 750 (1898); see also ApologyResolution[, Pub.L. No. 103-150, 107 Stat. 1510, 1512 (1993)(hereinafter Apology Resolution)]. 
Upon annexation, the
Republic of Hawai #i "ceded 1,800,000 acres of crown,
government and public lands of the Kingdom of Hawaii [to theUnited States], without the consent of or compensation tothe Native Hawaiian people of Hawaii or their sovereigngovernment." Apology Resolution at 1512. This court has recognized that the Republic "ced[ed] and transfer[red] tothe United States the absolute fee and ownership of allpublic, Government, or Crown lands . . . belonging to theGovernment of the Hawaiian Islands, together with everyright and appurtenance thereunto appertaining[.]" Trs. of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs v. Yamasaki, 69 Haw. 154,159, 737 P.2d 446, 449 (1987) (brackets in original) (citingNewlands Resolution at 750). Under the Newlands Resolution,the revenue and proceeds from these “ceded lands” were to"be used solely for the benefit of the inhabitants of theHawaiian Islands for educational and other public purposes."Newlands Resolution at 750. 
Congress then passed the Organic Act, Act of April 30,
1900, c. 339, 31 Stat. 141 (1900), reprinted in 1 [HRS] 86(2009), which "provided a government for the territory ofHawaii and defined the political structure and powers of thenewly established Territorial Government[.]" 
Apology
Resolution, at 1512. The Organic Act stated, in relevantpart: 
That the public property ceded and transferred to theUnited States by the Republic of Hawaii under thejoint resolution of annexation . . . shall be andremain in the possession, use, and control of thegovernment of the Territory of Hawaii, and shall bemaintained, managed, and cared for by it, at its ownexpense, until otherwise provided for by Congress, ortaken for the uses and purposes of the United Statesby direction of the President or of the governor ofHawaii. 
Organic Act, § 91.

6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2011) (footnotes omitted, some brackets added). Upon review of 
this history, we conclude that the territorial Governor had the authority, under Section 91 of the Organic Act, to set aside land for the United States. 
Appellants do not provide any other grounds on which 
the Governor's Executive Order can be found to have been unconstitutional. Thus, we conclude that Governor's Executive Order No. 1719 was properly issued and Appellants fail to state a claim in Count IV for which relief can be granted. 
Count V of Appellants' First Amended Complaint alleged 
that the blood quantum requirement under the HHCA, which defines qualified beneficiaries as being at minimum fifty percent (50%) Native Hawaiian, violates the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. Appellants asked the Circuit Court to enjoin the State from "requiring a certain percentage of blood quantum in order to be able to receive the benefits of the Hawaiian Home Commission Act." 
The purposes of the HHCA have been described in several 
ways, but at the core of these various descriptions is a consistent purpose – to benefit Native Hawaiians. See, e.g., Rice v. Cayetano, 528 U.S. 495, 507 (2000); Arakaki v. Lingle, 477 F.3d 1048, 1054 (9th Cir. 2007); Arakaki v. Hawaii, 314 F.3d 1091, 1092 n.2 (9th Cir. 2002); Keaukaha-Panaewa Community Ass'n v. Hawaiian Homes Comm'n, 588 F.2d 1216, 1218 (9th Cir. 1978); Kalima v. State, 111 
Hawai# i 84, 87, 137 P.3d 990, 993 (2006); 
Bush v. Hawaiian Homes Comm'n, 76 Hawai# i 128, 131-32, 870 P.2d 
1272, 1275-76 (1994); Ahuna v. Dep't of Hawaiian Home Lands, 64 Haw. 327, 336, 640 P.2d 1161, 1167 (1982). Under Section 201 of the HHCA, a Native Hawaiian is defined as "any descendant of not less than one-half part of the blood of the races inhabiting the Hawaiian Islands previous to 1778." HHCA § 201 (2009). 
The United States District Court for the District of 
Hawai# i has expressly held that the HHCA was constitutional, 
based in large part on Hawai# i courts' recognition of the similar 
treatment of Native Hawaiians and American Indians. Naliielua v. 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
State of Hawaii, 795 F. Supp. 1009, 1012-13 (D. Haw. 1990), 
aff'd, 940 F.2d 1535 (9th Cir. 1991) ("This court finds applicable the clear body of law surrounding preferences given to American Indians and finds that the United States' commitment to the native people of [Hawai# i], demonstrated through . . . the 
Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920, does not create a suspect classification which offends the constitution."). For the same reasoning, we conclude that the blood quantum requirement does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. 
Furthermore, Appellants seek relief in the form of 
a declaratory judgment essentially redefining a Native Hawaiian under the HHCA. A modification of the HHCA requires legislative action, which is not a type of relief that is in the hands of the courts. Accordingly, Appellants failed to state a claim in Count V for which relief can be granted. 
We conclude that, for all claims against the State 
Defendants in their First Amended Complaint, the Appellants failed to state claims for which relief can be granted.
II. Federal Defendants 
In its order dismissing the Federal Defendants, the 
Circuit Court 
sua sponte dismissed the Federal Defendants for 
lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Hawai# i Rules of 
Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 12(h)(3). 
On appeal, Appellants fail 
to state any alleged error committed by the Circuit Court with 
regards to its dismissal of the Federal Defendants. Rather, Appellants' argument regarding the Federal Defendants is encapsulated within a broad contention that the Circuit Court erred in dismissing all claims against all defendants. Thus, this court is not obligated to consider this argument as it relates to the Federal Defendants. See Kakinami v. Kakinami, 127 Hawai# i 126, 144 n.16, 276 P.3d 695, 713 n.16 (2012) (citing In 
re Guardianship of Carlsmith, 113 Hawai# i 236, 246, 151 P.3d 717, 
727 (2007) (noting that this court may "disregard a particular contention if the appellant makes no discernible argument in support of that position")). 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the State 
Defendants and Federal Defendants were properly dismissed and we 
AFFIRM the Circuit Court's Final Judgment entered on March 1, 2016.
