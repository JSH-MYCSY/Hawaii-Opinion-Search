OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
DIXON KODAMA, JR., Petitioner-Appellant, v.
ADMINISTRATIVE DIRECTOR OF THE COURTS,
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 1DAA-15-0006)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Ginoza, C.J., and Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Dixon Kodama, Jr. appeals from the 
February 9, 2016 Decision and Order Affirming Administrative 
Revocation ("February 9, 2016 Order") and the February 10, 2016 Notice of Entry of Judgment on Appeal ("February 10, 2016 Judgment on Appeal"), both entered by the District Court of the First Circuit ("District Court").
1/ The District Court affirmed 
the administrative revocation of Kodama's driver's license by Respondent-Appellee Administrative Director of the Courts, State of Hawai' i, acting through a hearing officer ("Hearing Officer") 
of the Administrative Driver's License Revocation Office ("ADLRO"). We review the District Court's decision under the right/wrong standard. Freitas v. Admin. Dir. of Courts, 108 
Hawai'i 31, 43, 116 P.3d 673, 685 (2005) (quoting Soderlund v. 
Admin. Dir. of the Courts, 96 Hawai' i 114, 118, 26 P.3d 1214, 
1218 (2001)).

On appeal, Kodama alleges that the District Court erred
 
in holding that there was no violation of due process in the
 
Hearing Officer's failure to give timely notice (1) that she
 would not consider Kodama's written request and objections
 submitted in the document entitled "REQUESTED INTOXILYZER
 5000/BLOOD TEST CASE HEARING PROCEDURE (05/14)" ("Request
 Document"), and (2) of what procedure she would follow at the
 administrative hearing.
2/
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments they advance and the issues they raise, as well as
 the relevant statutory and case law, we affirm.
 
(1) Kodama argues that he was denied due process
 
because he had no prior notice of the Hearing Officer's decision
 that she would not consider the Request Document and thus had no
 chance to object. Kodama further maintains that he provided the
 Request Document at the beginning of the hearing, that the
 Hearing Officer made no rulings at the hearing considering the
 objections or requests in the Request Document, and that in the
 Hearing Officer's findings and without notice to Kodama at the
 hearing, the Hearing Officer refused to consider the Request
 Document because the requests had not been made orally.
 
"[A] driver's license is a constitutionally protected 
interest and due process must be provided before one can be deprived of his or her license." Slupecki v. Admin. Dir. of the 
Courts, 110 Hawai' i 407, 413, 133 P.3d 1199, 1205 (2006) 
(internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Kernan v. Tanaka, 75 Haw. 1, 21, 856 P.2d 1207, 1218 (1993)). "[D]ue process requires that a person have an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner." Freitas v. Admin. Dir. of the 
Courts, 108 Hawai' i 31, 44, 116 P.3d 673, 686 (2005) (partial 
opinion by Acoba, J.) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting 
2/
 The proceedings consisted of three administrative hearings, held
on August 26, 2015; October 12, 2015; and November 24, 2015. This appeal
stems from and focuses on the November 24, 2015 hearing. Because one
 percipient witness, Honolulu Police Department Officer Niki Tejada, remained
unserved by the time of the November 24, 2015 hearing, the Hearing Officer
offered Kodama's counsel an opportunity to request a further continuance, but
counsel declined.

Farmer v. Admin. Dir. of the Courts, 94 Hawai' i 232, 238, 11 P.3d 
457, 463 (2000)). Due process, however, is not rigid as it "is 
flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands." Kernan, 75 Haw. at 22, 856 P.2d 
at 1218 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334 (1976)). The supreme court has stated that the ADLRO program, by providing a presuspension revocation hearing "sufficiently assure[s] reliable results and provide[s] adequate due process[,]" Freitas, 108 Hawai' i at 44, 
116 P.3d at 686 (quoting Farmer, 94 Hawai' i at 239, 11 P.3d at 
464) (internal quotation marks omitted), and that the program "has been examined and found not to violate due process." Id. at 
45, 116 P.3d at 687 (citing Kernan, 75 Haw. at 25-32, 856 P.2d at 1219-22). This appears to be the case here. 
The record reflects that the Hearing Officer declined
 
to place the Request Document into the record, because, she said
 "this is not really evidence. This sounds and looks . . . more
 like an argument or request for procedure." However, she invited
 counsel to make the same request on the record at which point,
 she said, she would consider it. Therefore, it is clear that
 Kodama had prior notice that the Hearing Officer would not
 receive the Request Document, but would consider any requested
 procedure and objections, and therefore Kodama had the chance to
 object but proceeded instead to his argument.
 
Furthermore, Kodama could have submitted the Request
 
Document to the Hearing Officer prior to the hearing but chose to
 wait until the day of the hearing to submit it. If Kodama had
 submitted the Request Document before the hearing took place, it
 would have become part of the record as the Hearing Officer
 received into evidence all the documents contained in the case
 file and made it part of the record at the commencement of the
 hearing. Kodama does not address this. Instead, Kodama argues
 that the Hearing Officer refused to consider the requests and
 objections in the Request Document because they had not been made
 orally. The transcript reflects otherwise, however. 
Accordingly, because the Hearing Officer expressly
 
alerted Kodama's counsel at the hearing that she would not
 
3
   
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
receive the written requests and objections in Kodama's Request 
Document, but provided an alternate methodology by which she would have addressed Kodama's requests and objections, Kodama had the opportunity to make an objection and be heard in a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner. Therefore, the District Court did not violate Kodama's due process rights. Freitas, 108 
Hawai'i at 44, 116 P.3d at 686. 
(2) Kodama next argues that "an ADLRO hearing officer
 
must make at least one finding at the hearing; namely, finding
 that the grounds for revocation have been established before
 requiring or inviting the driver to proceed with the driver's
 evidence." (Emphasis in original.) Such a finding, however, was
 made in this case. After admitting the evidence in the agency
 file, the hearing officer expressly concluded that:
 
I did receive all the evidence into the record and I do find
 
. . . that having done that[,] the statutory bases have been
met for an Administrative Revocation on the Respondent's
 license. Further, that since the arresting officer in this
matter has already [] appeared and [his testimony] waived [by
Kodama] that is all undisputed and [un]contested evidence.
 
The hearing officer then permitted Kodama's counsel to present
 
argument.
 
Kodama's Request Document set forth a proposed
 
procedure for the Hearing Officer to follow. In the event that
 the Hearing Officer declined to follow Kodama's proposed
 procedure, the Request Document asked that the Hearing Officer
 describe "exactly what procedure will be followed, which party
 has the burden of proof and the burden of producing evidence,
 whether and when the burden of producing evidence ever shifts in
 the course of the hearing, and whether the police carried their
 initial burden." 
In denying the admissibility of Kodama's Request
 
Document into the record, the Hearing Officer observed that the
 procedure Kodama requested appeared to be a shorter version of a
 procedure that the supreme court had already assessed and
 determined to be not required. In agreement with the Hearing
 Officer, the District Court stated in its February 9, 2016 Order: 
[T]he Court does find that in Freitas v. Administrative 
Director of the Courts, 108 Hawai 'i 31, 116 P.3d 673 (2005),
that a similar issue was addressed by [Kodama's] argumentrequiring the Hearings Officer to follow a six item procedure.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Here, the same six items and two subsequent paragraphs appear
to be identical to the proposed procedure listed by [Kodama]. 
The Supreme Court of Hawaii found that petitioner's proposal
in Freitas, id., to be [sic] an insufficient basis for
 
reversal of the administrative revocation. Likewise, this
 Court also finds that [Kodama's] position to be [sic]
 untenable. Moreover, upon review of the current record,
 [Kodama's] due process rights were not violated and the
 Hearings Officer correctly followed the requirements of Hawaii
Revised Statutes Section 291E-38
3/ in the administrative
 
hearing.
 
(Footnote added.) The Hearing Officer not only made the 
determination that grounds for revocation were established as required under Kernan, 75 Haw. at 30, 856 at 1222, and Freitas, 108 Hawai' i at 45, 116 P.3d at 687, but the process she provided 
satisfied the procedure established in HRS section 291E-38. The record reflects that Kodama was afforded a presuspension hearing in which he was afforded the opportunity to have witnesses called, was represented by counsel, and was never deprived of information sufficient to prepare and present objections to the ADLRO's decision. Accordingly, the Hearing Officer acted within her discretion in denying admission of the Request Document and in not expressly notifying the parties of what process she would be following, and the administrative revocation hearing did not infringe on Kodama's due process rights. See Freitas, 108 
Hawai'i at 44, 116 P.3d at 686; Kernan, 75 Haw. at 22, 856 P.2d 
at 1218; see also Desmond v. Admin. Dir. of the Courts, 91 
3/
 Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") section 291E-38 (Supp. 2014),
which governs administrative review procedures by the ADLRO, provides, in
relevant part: 
(d) The director shall conduct the hearing and have
 
authority to :
 
(1)	 Administer oaths and affirmations;
 
(2)	 Examine witnesses and take testimony;
 (3)	 Receive and determine the relevance of evidence;
 (4) 	 Issue subpoenas;
 
(5) 	Regulate the course and conduct of the hearing ;
 
(6) 	 Impose up to the maximum license revocation
period as specified under section 291E-41(b)(4);
and
 
(7) 	 Make a final ruling.

Hawai'i 212, 219, 982 P.2d 346, 353 (App. 1998), rev'd in part on 
other grounds, 90 Hawai' i 301, 978 P.2d 739 (1998). The District 
Court, therefore, did not err in holding that there was no 
violation of due process in the administrative revocation hearing and in affirming the ADLRO's administrative revocation of Kodama's license. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the February 9,
 
2016 Order and the February 10, 2016 Judgment on Appeal entered
 by the District Court of the First Circuit are affirmed.
