IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
 
v.
 
 
KIM T. SANICO, Defendant-Appellant
 
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
 
(CASE NO. 2DTA-15-01416)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)

 
After a bench trial, the District Court of the Second
 
 
1/

Circuit (District Court)  found Defendant-Appellant Kim T.
 
 
Sanico (Sanico) guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence
 
 
of an intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes
 
 
(HRS) §§ 291E-61(a)(1) and (b)(1) (2007 & Supp. 2016).2/ Sanico
 
 
appeals from the Judgment entered by the District Court on
 
 
February 19, 2016.3/
 
 
1/ The Honorable Adrianne N. Heely presided.
 
2/ HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) provides:
 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle
under the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates or
assumes actual physical control of a vehicle:
 
(1)	 While under the influence of alcohol in an amount
 sufficient to impair the person's normal mental
faculties or ability to care for the person and guard
against casualty[.]
 
3/ In his notice of appeal, Sanico also lists the District Court's
"Decision and Order Denying Defendant's Motion for New Trial," which was filed
on February 29, 2016, as an order from which he appeals. However, Sanico does
not raise a challenge to this order in his briefing on appeal, and we
therefore do not address it. 

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 

 


 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On appeal, Sanico contends that: (1) there was 
insufficient evidence to support his conviction; and (2) the District Court failed to obtain a valid waiver of his right to testify as required by Tachibana v. State, 79 Hawai
'i 226, 900 
P.2d 1293 (1995). For the reasons discussed below, we vacate the District Court's Judgment and remand the case for a new trial. 
I.
 
We resolve the arguments raised by Sanico on appeal as
 
follows:
 
1. There was sufficient evidence to support Sanico's
 
OVUII conviction. 
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai
'i (State) presented 
evidence that a police officer observed Sanico's car traveling at a high speed, faster than the posted speed limit, and then change lanes without using a turn signal. When the officer used his flashing blue lights and siren to effect a traffic stop of Sanico's car, the car swerved to the right and then "came to an abrupt stop," which caused the officer to "stomp on [his] brakes" to avoid rear-ending Sanico's car. 
The officer approached Sanico's car and interacted with
 
Sanico. The officer observed that Sanico's eyes were bloodshot
 and that Sanico had "a red flushed facial feature[.]" The
 officer detected the "odor of liquor" emanating from Sanico's
 breath. In conducting the field sobriety tests, the officer
 observed that Sanico displayed six clues of impairment during the
 Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN) test. On the walk-and-turn test,
 Sanico started too soon, missed heel-to-toe on one step, lost his
 balance when turning, and failed to perform the turn as
 instructed. Sanico did not show signs of impairment in
 performing the one-leg-stand test. The officer testified that it
 was his opinion that Sanico "was unable to continue to operate a
 vehicle safely upon a public roadway." 
When viewed in the light most favorable to the 
prosecution, State v. Richie, 88 Hawai
'i 19, 33, 960 P.2d 1227, 
1241 (1998), we conclude that the State presented sufficient 
2
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
evidence to support Sanico's OVUII conviction. The officer's
 
 
observation of Sanico's driving, the odor of liquor emanating
 
 
from Sanico's breath and his facial features, and Sanico's
 
 
performance on the field sobriety tests provided substantial
 
 
evidence to support the District Court's finding that Sanico was
 
 
guilty of OVUII.4/
 
   
2. The State concedes that the District Court failed
 
 
to obtain a valid waiver of Sanico's right to testify as required
 
 
by Tachibana. We agree with this concession of error. The
 
 
4/ We note that Sanico argues in his opening brief that we should
disregard the results of the HGN test because "[a]s the Hawai' i Supreme Court
has previously held, evidence of the results of the HGN test are admissible
only for purposes of determining probable cause for arrest and not assubstantive evidence of intoxication. State v. Mitchell, 94 Hawai' i 388,
396-97, 15 P.3d 314, 322-23 (App. 2000)." Sanico's Opening Brief at 25.Sanico's citation of Mitchell for the proposition that the Hawai' i Supreme
Court has previously held that the results of the HGN test are not admissibleas substantive evidence of intoxication is inaccurate. First, Mitchell is not a decision of the Hawai' i Supreme Court, but a decision of the
Intermediate Court of Appeals. More importantly, Mitchell did not decide theissue of whether the results of the HGN test are admissible as substantive evidence of intoxication. In Mitchell, this court concluded that the trialcourt erred in admitting the officer's opinion about the defendant'sperformance on the HGN test because the State had failed to lay a properfoundation for the officer's opinion, and not because HGN test results areinadmissible as substantive evidence of intoxication. Mitchell, 94 Hawai' i at 
397-98, 15 P.3d at 323-24. 
In State v. Ito, 90 Hawai' i 225, 241, 978 P.2d 191, 207 (App. 1999),
this court held that HGN test results were sufficiently reliable to beadmitted as evidence that police had probable cause to believe that adefendant was driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor. Because the issue of whether HGN test results "are admissible at trial as evidence of a defendant's intoxication" was not presented in Ito, we did not decide theissue. Ito, 90 Hawai' i at 241, 978 P.2d at 207. Contrary to Sanico's
assertion, there is no holding by the Hawai' i Supreme Court or this court that
HGN test results are not admissible as substantive evidence of intoxication,as this issue remains to be decided. 
Here, Sanico acknowledges that he "did not object [at trial] to the
officer's testimony regarding the [HGN test] results and the officer's opinionon Sanico's performance." Sanico therefore waived his ability to challengethe District Court's consideration of such evidence on appeal. See State v. 
Wallace, 80 Hawai' i 382, 410, 910 P.2d 695, 723 (1996) (concluding that the
defendant's challenge to testimony based on lack of foundation was waived forfailure to object at trial on this basis); State v. Samuel, 74 Haw. 141, 147,838 P.2d 1374, 1378 (1992) ("The general rule is that evidence to which noobjection has been made may properly be considered by the trier of fact andits admission will not constitute grounds for reversal."); State v. Kassebeer,118 Hawai' i 493, 505, 193 P.3d 409, 421 (2008) (holding that the defendant
waived the right to challenge testimony relating to a handgun due to hisfailure to object). In any event, we conclude that the evidence wassufficient even without considering the HGN test results.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
District Court's Tachibana advisement was deficient. The 
District Court did not advise Sanico, or obtain any assurance that he understood, that if he wanted to testify, no one could prevent him from doing so. See Tachibana, 79 Hawai
'i at 236 n.7, 
900 P.2d at 1303 n.7. We cannot say that this error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See State v. Hoang, 94 Hawai
'i 271, 
279, 12 P.3d 371, 379 (App. 2000). 
II.
 
Based on the foregoing, we vacate the District Court's
 
Judgment and remand the case for a new trial on the charge
 against Sanico for OVUII, in violation of HRS §§ 291E-61(a)(1)
 and (b)(1).
