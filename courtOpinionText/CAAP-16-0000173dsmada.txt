STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
WAYNE R. MATSUI, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 13-1-000343)

 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record in CAAP-16-0000173, it 
appears that this court lacks appellate jurisdiction over the 
appeal. Defendant-Appellant Wayne R. Matsui (Appellant) appeals from the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence, filed on December 17, 2013, in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit. Appellant, pro se, filed a Notice of Appeal on March 16, 2016, more than 2 years after entry of the December 17, 2013 Judgment of Conviction and Sentence. Therefore the appeal is untimely. HRAP Rule 4(b). "In criminal cases, [the supreme court] ha[s] made exceptions to the requirement that notices of appeal be timely filed." 
State v. 
Irvine, 88 Hawai 'i 404, 407, 967 P.2d 236, 239 (1998). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Specifically, the supreme court has permitted belated appeals under
 
two sets of circumstances: (1) when defense counsel has
 inexcusably or ineffectively failed to pursue a defendant’s appeal
 from a criminal conviction in the first instance, or (2) when the
 lower court’s decision was unannounced and no notice of the entry
 of judgment was ever provided. Id. Appellant has not demonstrated
 
that either exception applies to this case. Accordingly, this
 court lacks appellate jurisdiction over the appeal. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is dismissed for
 
lack of appellate jurisdiction without prejudice to Appellant
 filing a Petition, pursuant to Rule 40 of the Hawaii Rules of Penal
 Procedure.
