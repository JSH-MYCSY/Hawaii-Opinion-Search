APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT

SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER

 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, and Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant GD ("Mother") appeals from the 
February 11, 2016 Order Denying Defendant's Motion and Affidavit 
for Order to Show Cause and Relief After Order or Decree, Filed on October 8, 2015 ("February 11, 2016 Order") entered by the Family Court of the Third Circuit ("Family Court").
1 On appeal, 
Mother appears to assert that her right to privacy, her Fourth Amendment right, and discrimination laws were violated by the Child Support Enforcement Agency, State of Hawai
'i. 
Upon careful review of the record and the brief
 
2
submitted by Mother  and having given due consideration to the
arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve Mother's
 points of error as follows, and affirm.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Mother does not provide any legal citation, argument, 
or reference to the record in her opening brief to support what 
we construe to be her points of error.3 Since Mother fails to 
carry her burden of establishing that the Family Court abused its discretion when it denied her post-judgment motion under Hawai
'i 
Family Court Rules 60(b), we will not disturb the Family Court's February 11, 2016 Order. In re RGB, 123 Hawai
'i 1, 17, 229 P.3d 
1066, 1082 (2010) ("[T]he burden of establishing abuse of discretion is on appellant, and a strong showing is required to establish it." (quoting State v. Hinton, 120 Hawai
'i 265, 273, 
204 P.3d 484, 492 (2009))). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the February 11,
 
2016 Order Denying Defendant's Motion and Affidavit for Order to
 Show Cause and Relief After Order or Decree, Filed on October 8,
 2015, entered by the Family Court of the Third Circuit, is
 affirmed.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai
'i, Decebmer 8, 2016. 
On the brief:
 
Presiding Judge
Associate Judge
 Associate Judge
 GD,

Pro Se Defendant-Appellant.
 
3/
 Mother's opening brief, therefore, fails to comply with Rule 28(b)
of the Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure.
