APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT

 NO. 15-1-020K)
 
ORDER DISMISSING THE APPEAL PURSUANT TO HRAP RULE 11 (b), (c)(2)
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that: 
(1) On March 17, 2016, Respondent-Appellant John A. 
Kalua'u (Appellant), pro se, filed a notice of appeal from the 
February 16, 2016 circuit court order in the underlying case, S.P. No. 15-1-020K, granting Petitioner Meredith Kailua-Kona,
 LLC's motion for a preliminary injunction.
 
(2) The circuit court order states, in part, that due 
to Appellant not providing a valid mailing address, all documents and notices required to be served upon Appellant, pursuant to the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure, shall be placed in a court 
jacket established by the circuit court clerk and located adjacent to the clerk's office;  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(3) On March 17, 2016, the circuit court clerk notified
 
Appellant to pay the filing fees or file a petition to proceed in
 
forma pauperis by the close of business on April 11, 2016, or the
 "case may be dismissed." It is not clear whether or how the
 circuit court clerk served this notice on Appellant;
 
(4) On July 14, 2016, the appellate clerk notified
 
Appellant that the time to docket the record on appeal expired on
 May 16, 2016, the filing and docketing fees had not been paid,
 the record on appeal cannot be prepared without the fees or an
 order authorizing Appellant to proceed on appeal in forma
 pauperis, the matter would be called to the court's attention on
 July 25, 2016, for action that may include dismissal, and
 Appellant may file a motion requesting relief from default. That
 same day, the circuit court clerk placed the notice in the court
 jacket designated for service upon Appellant;
 
(5) Appellant did not pay the filing fees, or take any
 
further action in this appeal; and
 
(6) An appeal may be dismissed where the record on 
appeal has not been prepared because the appellant failed to pay the required fees or obtain an order allowing the appellant to proceed in forma pauperis. Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
(HRAP) Rule 11(b)(2), (c)(2). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed. 
Dated: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, September 26, 2016.
