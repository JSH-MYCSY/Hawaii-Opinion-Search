MEMORANDUM OPINION 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Reifurth and Chan, JJ.) 
This consolidated appeal arises out of a lease dispute 
between Defendant/Counterclaim-Plaintiff/Appellant/Cross-Appellee 
Gold Guys Holdings, LLC, dba Gold Guys Hawaii, LLC (Gold Guys) and Defendant/Appellant/Cross-Appellee Shane A. Maguire (Maguire) (collectively, Appellants) and Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellee/Cross-Appellant Victoria Ward Center, L.L.C. (Ward). 
Appellants appeal, and Ward cross-appeals, from the 
February 22, 2016 Judgment (2/22/16 Judgment) entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit court),
1 which 
entered judgment pursuant to a jury verdict (1) in favor of Ward and against Appellants as to Ward's complaint, and (2) in favor of Gold Guys and against Ward as to Gold Guys' second amended counterclaim.  Both parties also challenge the circuit court's post-judgment rulings regarding, inter alia, a motion for new trial and motions for attorneys' fees, costs, and prejudgment interest. 
I. BACKGROUND 
A. Factual Background 
In April 2010, Ward licensed to Gold Guys a retail

space (Space No. B00021C) in Ward Centre,2 1200 Ala Moana Blvd., 
Honolulu, Hawai# i 96814 pursuant to a license agreement (2010 
License Agreement).  The 2010 License Agreement provided for a 
term running from May 1, 2010, to July 30, 2011, and was executed by Joseph Beasy (Beasy), a co-owner of Gold Guys, and Donna Farrell (Farrell), the former general manager of Ward Centers.
3 
In early 2011, Gold Guys subsequently licensed an 
additional retail space (Space No. B02104B) across the hall, pursuant to a temporary revocable license agreement (2011 License Agreement) between Gold Guys and Ward, in its capacity as manager for owner Howard Hughes Corporation (Howard Hughes).
4 The 2011 
License Agreement provided for a term running from March 1, 2011, to February 28, 2012, and was executed by Maguire, as co-owner of Gold Guys, and Farrell.  The 2011 License Agreement also included a clause (Prohibited Radius Clause) providing: "Prohibited Radius: Within ten (10) miles of the perimeter of Ward Centers or within Kahala Mall." 
Shortly after, Ward Plaza-Warehouse, LLC (Ward Plaza)
5 
entered into a temporary revocable license agreement with Secured Gold Buyers (Secured) for a space in Ward Warehouse.  The license agreement provided for a term running from March 1, 2011, to March 31, 2012. 
In March 2011, Gold Guys became aware that Secured 
would be opening a store in Ward Warehouse and relayed to Ward its displeasure with the news.  Secured eventually closed its store in Ward Warehouse as its license agreement for the space expired on March 31, 2012. 
On February 14, 2012, Gold Guys entered into a long-
2 Ward Centre shopping center is also referred to and known as "Ward 
Center." 
3 Ward Centers, now known as Ward Village, is comprised of multiple
shopping centers including: Ward Entertainment Center; Ward Village Shops; Ward
Centre; Ward Warehouse; and Ward Gateway Center. 
4 At the time Gold Guys entered into the 2010 License Agreement, Ward
and the rest of the Ward Centers shopping centers were owned by General GrowthProperties (GGP), but were subsequently acquired by Howard Hughes. 
5 Although Ward Plaza is a separate legal entity from Ward, both Ward
and Ward Plaza are sister companies owned by Howard Hughes.

term lease agreement with Ward for the first space in Ward Center 
(Space No. B00021C) (2012 Center Lease) and a long-term lease agreement with Ward Plaza for the space formerly occupied by Secured in Ward Warehouse (Space A001111) (2012 Warehouse Lease). The 2012 Center Lease provided an effective date of January 1, 2012.  The 2012 Warehouse Lease provided a commencement date of May 1, 2012, or the date on which Gold Guys opened for business in Ward Warehouse, whichever was earlier. 
In May 2013, Gold Guys defaulted on their rental 
payments for the Ward Center retail space, and Ward initiated the underlying action in this case against Gold Guys and Shane Maguire, as guarantor, for breach of the 2012 Center Lease.
B. Procedural Background 
On May 23, 2013, Ward filed a complaint for breach of 
the 2012 Center Lease against Appellants in the District Court of 
the First Circuit (district court), Civ. No. 1RC13-1-3862.  Ward sought both possession of the subject property and compensatory money damages. 
On June 26, 2013, the district court entered a judgment 
for possession in favor of Ward and against Appellants, which did not adjudicate the issue of compensatory money damages. 
On September 9, 2013, as a result of a demand for a 
jury trial filed by Appellants, the district court entered an order transferring this case to the circuit court, where it became Civ. No. 13-1-2461-09. 
On October 15, 2013, Appellants filed an answer to 
Ward's complaint in the circuit court.  Gold Guys (but not Maguire) also filed a counterclaim against Ward for breach of the 2012 Center Lease and for tortious interference.  On January 8, 2014, Appellants filed a first amended answer and Gold Guys filed a first amended counterclaim.
6  On August 5, 2014, Gold Guys 
stipulated to dismiss with prejudice its claim for tortious interference. 
6 The relief requested in the first amended counterclaim was the
rescission of the 2012 Center Lease, whereas the relief requested in the
counterclaim was the rescission of the 2012 Warehouse Lease. In all other respects, the first amended counterclaim was identical to the counterclaim. 
4            
            
            
            
              
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On November 13, 2015, the circuit court entered partial 
summary judgment in Gold Guys' favor, ruling that Ward breached 
the Prohibited Radius Clause in the 2011 License Agreement when Ward Plaza licensed the space in Ward Warehouse to Secured.
7 
On January 5, 2016, Gold Guys filed a second amended 
counterclaim, asserting a single cause of action against Ward for breach of the 2011 License Agreement.  The second amended counterclaim alleged that "[Ward] breached the 2011 License Agreement when [Ward] licensed space to a [Gold Guys] competitor within ten miles of the Ward Center Shopping Centers, in violation of the Prohibited Radius Clause of the 2011 License Agreement." 
On January 11, 2016, prior to the trial, the circuit 
court entered its Order Regarding Court's Modified Instruction 3.5 and Related Issues (Jury Instruction Order) establishing the following: 
1.  The Civil Pattern Jury Instruction No 3.5, is
modified by the court as follows: 
In this case, the issue of liability for breach
of the 2011 License Agreement between Plaintiff
Victoria Ward Centre and Defendant Gold Guys has
already been decided against Plaintiff.
It has been determined that Plaintiff Ward 
Centre breached the 2011 License Agreement and harmedDefendant Gold Guys, when Plaintiff Ward Centre'ssister company, Ward Warehouse, licensed space to aSecured Gold Buyers, a competitor of Defendant GoldGuys. 
The burden is still on Defendant Gold Guys to
prove the nature and extent of any damages suffered byDefendant Gold Guys.
Therefore, the only question you must decide is:
what amount of damages, if any, Defendant Gold Guys isentitled to, for the breach of the 2011 LicenseAgreement. 
2.  
In opening statement, both sides may refer to this
instruction and quote from it.  Background factual detailsconsistent with this instruction are allowed, in openingstatement. 
3.  In opening statement and during trial, any mention
of "court ruling" or "court order" is prohibited, and anymention of the court or the judge as having determined the 
7 Gold Guys did not plead breach of the 2011 License Agreement in
either its counterclaim or first amended counterclaim. On December 28, 2015, the
circuit court entered an order granting in part and denying in part Appellants'motion to amend its counterclaim, ruling that the parties had litigated breach ofthe 2011 License Agreement by consent and that there is no claim for breach ofthe 2012 Center Lease. 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
issue of breach, is prohibited. [Hawai #i Rules of Evidence 
(HRE)] Rule 403. 
4.  In opening statement and during trial, any mention
of the "prohibited radius clause", or any other similar
contractual language from the 2011 License Agreement, shallbe prohibited.  HRE Rule 402, 403. 
Several witnesses were called to testify at the jury 
trial, including Farrell, in her capacity as the former manager 
of Ward Centers and a signer of the 2011 License Agreement.  In response to questioning from Ward's counsel during direct examination, Farrell testified that exclusivity provisions were not common in lease agreements for Ward Centers.  During cross-examination, Appellants' counsel then attempted to question Farrell about whether there was an exclusivity provision in Gold Guys' 2011 License Agreement, which line of questioning the circuit court precluded. 
On January 21, 2016, the jury issued a verdict: (1) in 
favor of Ward and against Appellants as to Ward's complaint for breach of the 2012 Center Lease, awarding Ward money damages in the amount of $216,860.02; and (2) in favor of Gold Guys and against Ward as to the damages component of Gold Guys' second amended counterclaim for breach of the 2011 License Agreement, awarding Gold Guys money damages in the amount of $1.00. 
On February 18, 2016, Appellants filed a Hawai# i Rules 
of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 59 (2000) post-judgment motion for a new trial or, in the alternative, additur (Motion for New Trial/Additur).  In support of the motion, Appellants asserted: "(1) the jury's verdict [was] grossly inadequate and against the manifest weight of the evidence; [and] (2) the jury was confused or ignored the [circuit court's] prior finding on exclusivity and 'harm' and/or accepted [Ward's] improper argument of 'foreseeability.'" 
On February 22, 2016, the circuit court entered the 
2/22/16 Judgment pursuant to the jury verdict. 
On February 23, 2016, Ward filed an HRCP Rule 54(d) 
post-judgment motion for attorneys' fees, costs, and prejudgment interest (Ward's Motion for Attorneys' Fees/Costs/Interest). 
On March 3, 2016, Gold Guys filed an HRCP Rule 54(d) 
6  
           
               
        NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
post-judgment motion for costs (Gold Guys' Motion for Costs). 
On March 22, 2016, Gold Guys filed a notice of appeal 
from the 2/22/16 Judgment, resulting in CAAP-16-0000211. 
On April 6, 2016, the circuit court held a hearing on 
Appellants' Motion for New Trial/Additur.  At the beginning of 
the hearing, the circuit court shared its initial concerns that evidentiary error had occurred during Farrell's testimony. Despite its initial inclinations, the circuit court proceeded to hear arguments from both parties and took the matter under advisement. 
On May 31, 2016, the circuit court entered a post-
judgment order denying Appellants' Motion for New Trial/Additur (Order Denying Motion for New Trial/Additur).  The circuit court ruled that the jury's verdict was neither inadequate nor against the manifest weight of the evidence, there was no evidence of jury confusion, no evidentiary error occurred, and even if any evidentiary error had occurred, that it was waived because Appellants had failed to make an objection at trial.
8 The 
circuit court also reasoned that additur has not yet been approved as a lawful remedy by Hawai# i courts and would not be an 
appropriate remedy in this case. 
On July 19, 2016, the circuit court entered a post-
judgment order purporting to grant Ward's Motion for Attorneys' Fees/Costs/Interest (Order Granting Ward's Motion for Attorneys' Fees/Costs/Interest).  On the same day, the circuit court also entered a post-judgment order purporting to grant Gold Guys' Motion for Costs (Order Granting Gold Guys' Motion for Costs). 
On August 17, 2016, the circuit court entered a "Final 
Judgment" (8/17/16 Judgment) which re-entered judgment pursuant to the jury verdict and additionally entered judgment on the orders regarding Ward's Motion for Attorneys' Fees/Costs/Interest and Gold Guys' Motion for Costs. 
On August 18, 2016, Gold Guys filed a notice of appeal 
from the Order Granting Ward's Motion for Attorneys' 
8 In its order, the circuit court also referenced the comments that it
had made at the April 6, 2016 hearing but concluded that, upon a closer review of
the entire direct examination, no evidentiary error had occurred.

Fees/Costs/Interest, which resulted in CAAP-16-0000581.9  On the 
same day, Ward also filed a cross-appeal in CAAP-16-0000211, 
seeking appellate review of the 2/22/16 Judgment and other ancillary rulings, such as the orders granting Ward's Motion for Attorneys' Fees/Costs/Interest and Gold Guys' Motion for Costs. 
On September 16, 2016, Gold Guys filed a notice of 
appeal from the 8/17/16 Judgment, which resulted in CAAP-16-0000622. 
The appeals in CAAP-16-0000211, CAAP-16-0000581, and 
CAAP-16-0000622 were consolidated under CAAP-16-0000211 on November 4, 2016. 
II. POINTS OF ERROR 
On appeal, Appellants argue that the circuit court 
erred by: (1) admitting direct examination testimony of Farrell insinuating the lack of an exclusivity provision/Prohibited Radius Clause in the 2011 License Agreement; (2) precluding Appellants from cross-examining Farrell regarding said testimony; (3) further modifying jury instruction 3.5 to remove language that had originally been included as set forth in the Jury Instruction Order; (4) allowing Ward, in its closing argument, to improperly suggest that there was no exclusivity provision/radius restriction in the 2011 License Agreement; (5) entering a judgment that was manifestly against the weight of the evidence as to Gold Guys' damages; (6) denying Appellants' motion for new trial despite evidentiary errors and the manifest weight of the evidence; (7) deeming additur an unavailable and inappropriate remedy and denying Appellants' alternative motion for additur; and (8) granting Ward's Motion for Attorneys' Fees/Costs/Interest after the 90-day deadline set forth in HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) and entering the 8/17/16 Judgment. 
On cross-appeal, Ward contends that the circuit court 
9 This appeal of the Order Granting Ward's Motion for Attorneys'
Fees/Costs/Interest is, in effect, another appeal from the 2/22/16 Judgment. By 
way of their March 22, 2016 appeal from the 2/22/16 Judgment, Appellantsautomatically obtained appellate review of the Order Granting Ward's Motion for
Attorneys' Fees/Costs/Interest. Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule
4( 
a)(3) (2016) ("The notice of appeal shall be deemed to appeal the disposition
of all post-judgment motions that are timely filed after entry of the judgment or
order."). 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
erred by: (1) partially denying Ward's Motion for Attorneys' 
Fees/Costs/Interest; (2) partially granting Gold Guys' Motion for Costs; (3) granting Gold Guys' motion for partial summary judgment on the counterclaim and denying Ward's motion for summary judgment on the counterclaim; and (4) admitting the testimony, report, and curriculum vitae of Gold Guys' expert witness, Thomas Loudat, Ph.D. (Loudat).  Ward states, however, that consideration of its points of error pertaining to summary judgment and Loudat's testimony is necessary only if this court vacates the judgment and orders a new trial. 
We resolve the parties' points of error as follows.
III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A. Admission of Evidence 
Different standards of review must be applied to trial court
decisions regarding the admissibility of evidence, dependingon the requirements of the particular rule of evidence atissue.  When application of a particular evidentiary rulecan yield only one correct result, the proper standard forappellate review is the right/wrong standard.  Where the evidentiary ruling at issue concerns admissibility basedupon relevance, under Hawai #i Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rules
401 and 402, the proper standard of appellate review is theright/wrong standard.  Evidentiary decisions based on HRERule 403, which require a judgment call on the part of thetrial court, are reviewed for an abuse of discretion.  The trial court abuses its discretion when it clearly exceedsthe bounds of reason or disregards rules or principles oflaw or practice to the substantial detriment of a partylitigant. 
Tabieros v. Clark Equip. Co., 85 Hawai# i 336, 350–51, 944 P.2d 
1279, 1293–94 (1997) (block quote format altered) (internal 
citations, brackets, quotation marks, and ellipsis omitted).
B. Jury Instructions 
"The standard of review for a trial court's issuance or 
refusal of a jury instruction is whether, when read and 
considered as a whole, the instructions given are prejudicially insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent, or misleading."  Moyle v. Y & Y Hyup Shin, Corp., 118 Hawai# i 385, 391, 191 P.3d 1062, 1068 
(2008) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).
C. Jury Verdict on Damages 
In reviewing a jury's award of damages, 
[appellate courts] are bound by the general rule that "a
finding of an amount of damages is so much within theexclusive province of the jury that it will not be disturbedon appellate review unless palpably not supported by the 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
evidence, or . . . as to demonstrate that the jury in
assessing damages acted against rules of law or sufferedtheir passions or prejudices to mislead them." 
Sato v. Tawata, 79 Hawai# i 14, 21–22, 897 P.2d 941, 948–49 (1995) 
(quoting Quedding v. Arisumi Bros., 66 Haw. 335, 339, 661 P.2d 
706, 709 (1983)).
D. Motion for New Trial 
"Both the grant and the denial of a motion for new 
trial is within the trial court's discretion, and [the appellate 
court] will not reverse that decision absent a clear abuse of discretion."  Kawamata Farms, Inc. v. United Agri. Prods., 86 Hawai# i 214, 251, 948 P.2d 1055, 1092 (1997) (internal quotation 
marks and citation omitted).  "A court abuses its discretion whenever it exceeds the bounds of reason or disregards rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party."  Abastillas v. Kekona, 87
 Hawai# i 446, 449, 958 P.2d 
1136, 1139 (1998) (internal quotation marks, citation, and ellipsis omitted).
E. Attorneys' Fees and Costs 
[The appellate] court reviews the denial and granting of
attorney's fees under the abuse of discretion standard.  The same standard applies to [the appellate] court's review ofthe amount of a trial court's award of attorney's fees. 
Chun v. Bd. of Trs. of Emps. Ret. Sys., 106 Hawai# i 416, 431, 106

brackets, and ellipses omitted).
IV.
DISCUSSION 
A. 2/22/16 Judgment and Motion for New Trial/Additur 
Appellants essentially argue that the jury verdict 
cannot stand, and that the 2/22/16 Judgment must therefore be vacated, due to (1) the manifest weight of the evidence and (2) evidentiary errors causing jury confusion.  Appellants further contend that the circuit court abused its discretion in denying Appellants' motion for new trial/additur on these bases.
1. Jury Confusion Regarding Exclusivity 
Appellants contend that the circuit court erred when it 
admitted the testimony of Farrell discussing "exclusivity" and precluded Appellants from cross-examining Farrell on the issue of "exclusivity."  The testimonial statements in contention are 
10 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
contained in the following exchanges during direct examination 
discussing Farrell's conversation with Beasy after Beasy became aware of Secured's licensing of a space in Ward Warehouse: 
[WARD'S COUNSEL:] What else did you tell Joe Beasy? 
[FARRELL:] Well, typically when a tenant is upset about us
bringing in somebody who has a similar business or a likeproduct that they're selling, I have had this happen and itstill happens that I explain to the tenants that none of thetenants, none of the retailers in our centers have exclusiveagreements and that we don't do that because we want to beable to offer customers the opportunity to make businessdecisions and go and buy products and service from thestores that give them the best deals. 
Additionally, after questioning about letters of intent 
and discussions Farrell had with Beasy about Gold Guys further 
leasing space, Farrell's testimony continued: 
[WARD'S COUNSEL:] And based on your experience as a General
Manager at Ward Centers, was an exclusivity provision acommon provision in lease agreements? 
[FARRELL:] No, it was not. [WARD'S COUNSEL:] And in your experience, who at Ward
Centers had an exclusivity provision in their agreements? 
[FARRELL:] The only ones that typically have them are either
anchor tenants or the big box retailers like the Borders andthe theater, Consolidated Theaters, and, you know, Dave andBusters.  Those leases I know had some type of exclusivelanguage and/or a radius on each. 
[WARD'S COUNSEL:] And these --[APPELLANTS' COUNSEL]: Your Honor, may I approach the
bench, please? 
[WARD'S COUNSEL]: I only have one last question. THE COURT: Okay.  Overruled. [APPELLANTS' COUNSEL]: Ask your last question. THE COURT: Last question. [WARD'S COUNSEL]: I withdraw that.  I don't have any further 
questions. 
The following exchange then occurred during Appellants' 
cross-examination of Farrell: 
[APPELLANTS' COUNSEL:] Is your assumption in testifying heretoday that in the 2011 license agreement, Gold Guys did nothave exclusivity? 
[WARD'S COUNSEL]: Objection. 
[FARRELL:] Yes. 
11 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
[APPELLANTS' COUNSEL:] Did you meet with – 
THE COURT: You know what? I'm going to sustain and -- I'm
going to sustain the objection. 
[APPELLANTS' COUNSEL]: Now may I approach the bench, Your
Honor? 
THE COURT: Yes. 
(Emphases added).  After a lengthy bench conference, the circuit 
court concluded as follows: 
THE COURT: The radius came out in passing and it came out in
the context of lease, and I don't think there was anintentional violation. 
[APPELLANTS' COUNSEL]: As long as there's instructions. 
THE COURT: So you can question, but I'm not going to allow
any of that.  Don't talk about radius, okay, so that's notbeing allowed.  And we'll just take it objection by objection. 
Appellants argue that the admission of Farrell's 
testimony during Ward's direct examination constituted 
evidentiary error because it was in violation of the Jury Instruction Order's direction not to discuss the Prohibited Radius Clause.  Appellants claim that Farrell's testimony gave the jury the false impression that Gold Guys did not have exclusivity under the 2011 License Agreement, thereby causing jury confusion as to the issue of breach of the 2011 License Agreement (which had already been adjudicated via summary judgment) and the damages resulting from the breach (which was the issue for the jury to determine at trial).  Appellants also contend that the circuit court's preclusion of Appellants from cross-examining Farrell as to any exclusivity provisions in the 2011 License Agreement and about the Jury Instruction Order further exacerbated the jury confusion as it did not allow Appellants to correct the alleged error caused by Farrell's direct testimony about exclusivity.  This jury confusion, Appellants argue, "is the only explanation for the $1.00 jury verdict in the face of the undisputed factual evidence" of Gold Guys' damages.  We are not persuaded by Appellants' argument. 
First, there was no objection to Farrell's testimony on 
direct examination about exclusivity provisions.  Appellants' counsel asked for a bench conference after the testimony had been 
12          
         NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
given.  Second, Farrell's testimony during Ward's direct 
examination was not in direct violation of the Jury Instruction Order.  The Jury Instruction Order precluded the parties from mentioning "the 'prohibited radius clause', or any other similar contractual language from the 2011 License Agreement."  (Emphasis added).  Ward's line of questioning, although less than precise, sought to rebut Gold Guys' duress defense against Ward's claim for breach of contract, by demonstrating that Gold Guys obtained a provision in the 2012 Center Lease that other entities seldom got.  The line of questioning by Ward's counsel discussed lease agreements and therefore did not touch upon the existence of exclusivity arrangements in the 2011 License Agreement.  The circuit court therefore did not err in admitting Farrell's testimony.  No violation of the Jury Instruction Order occurred until Appellants' cross-examination, when Appellants' counsel explicitly attempted to ask Farrell about exclusivity in the 2011 License Agreement.  The circuit court did not err in precluding Appellants from cross-examining Farrell on the existence of an exclusivity provision in the 2011 License Agreement, which would have directly violated the Jury Instruction Order. 
We also reject Appellants' contention that, during 
closing argument, Ward improperly interjected issues of foreseeability related to the radius restriction in the 2011 License Agreement, thereby exacerbating already existing jury confusion.  Even with liability for breach of the 2011 License Agreement already decided, the foreseeability of the damages resulting from the breach was still an element of the measure of damages that Gold Guys had the burden to prove at trial.
10  As 
10 The circuit court read the following instruction to the jury
regarding the measure of damages for a breach of contract: 
The  m easure  of  damages  for  a  breach  of  contract  is  the  amount
of  money  which  will  fairly  compensate  a  party  for  any  losses
caused  by  the  breach  which  were  reasonably  foreseeable  to  both
parties  at  the  time  they  entered  into  the  contract.   The 
amount  of  damages  must  be  proved  with  reasonable  certainty  and
may  not  be  based  upon  mere  speculation  or  guess.   Any  damages 
which  you  award  must  be  reasonable  in  amount.   If  a  party  has

damages  with  reasonable  certainty,  you  must  award  that  party

such, Ward's closing argument properly referenced foreseeability 
as an element of Gold Guys' counterclaim for breach of contract damages. 
Appellants also argue that the circuit court's omission 
of certain language from the final jury instructions caused further jury confusion as to the issue of damages resulting from Ward's breach of the 2011 License Agreement.  The circuit court's final jury instructions did not include the following language that had originally been included in the instruction (and which had been read during opening statements) as established by the Jury Instruction Order: "It has been determined that Plaintiff Ward Centre breached the 2011 License Agreement and harmed Defendant Gold Guys, when Plaintiff Ward Centre's sister company, Ward Warehouse, licensed space to a Secured Gold Buyers, a competitor of Defendant Gold Guys."  However, the final jury instruction still provided that the issue of liability for breach of the 2011 License Agreement had already been decided in favor of Gold Guys and that the only question for the jury to decide was the amount of damages. 
The record reveals that Appellants had numerous 
opportunities to object to the final modified jury instruction that they now challenge.  At each of these opportunities, Appellants not only failed to object, they expressly approved the instruction.  The final modified jury instruction was therefore given by agreement of both parties.  Moreover, Appellants' counsel discussed and stressed the instruction to the jury during closing argument.  Inasmuch as Appellants did not object to the final jury instruction, Appellants urge this court to recognize plain error.  We find no such plain error where the final instruction, even with the omission of the indicated sentence in this case, is not "prejudicially insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent, or misleading."  Moyle, 118 
Hawai# i at 391, 191 
P.3d at 1068 (citation omitted). 
The primary basis for Appellants' appeal of the jury 
10(...continued)
(Emphasis added.) 
14 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
verdict is that the jury must have been confused as to the 
existence of an exclusivity/radius restriction in the 2011 License Agreement.  Appellants do not provide this court with any evidence of jury confusion, nor do we find any such evidence upon review of the record. 
The record reflects that both parties made numerous 
statements to the jury clarifying that liability for breach of the 2011 License Agreement had already been established and that the scope of the jury trial on Gold Guys' counterclaim was limited to determining the amount of damages to be awarded.  Both parties referenced the instruction in each of their opening statements and again in each of their closing arguments.  These repeated statements to the jury correctly articulated the jury's responsibilities per the instruction and there were no inconsistencies. 
The record further reflects more than one occasion on 
which the circuit court instructed the jury about Gold Guys' counterclaim.  The circuit court instructed the jury before Gold Guys' case-in-chief, as follows: 
In this case, the issue of liability for breach of the
2011 license agreement between Plaintiff Victoria Ward
Center and Defendant Gold Guys has already been decidedagainst Plaintiff.  It has been determined that Plaintiff Ward Center breached the 2011 license agreement and harmedDefendant Gold Guys when Plaintiff Ward Center's sistercompany Ward Warehouse licensed space to Secured GoldBuyers, a competitor of Defendant Gold Guys.
The burden is still on Defendant Gold Guys to prove
the nature and extent of any damages suffered by DefendantGold Guys.  Therefore, the only question you must decide iswhat amount of damages, if any, Defendant Gold Guys isentitled to for the breach of the 2011 license agreement. 
The circuit court instructed the jury again in its final jury 
instructions before jury deliberations, as follows: 
In this case, the issue of liability on the
counterclaim for breach of the 2011 license agreement has
already been decided against counterclaim defendant WardCenter, and in favor of counterclaim plaintiff Gold Guys.The burden is still on counterclaim plaintiff Gold Guys toprove the nature and extent of any damages suffered by GoldGuys on its counterclaim.  Therefore, as to thecounterclaim, the only question you must decide is whatamount of damages, if any, counterclaim plaintiff Gold Guysis entitled to for the breach of the 2011 license agreement. 
"As a rule, juries are presumed to be reasonable and 
follow all of the trial court's instructions."  Sato, 79 Hawai# i 
15 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
at 21, 897 P.2d at 948 (quoting Montalvo v. Lapez, 77 Hawai# i 
282, 301, 884 P.2d 345, 364 (1994)).  On this record, we conclude 
that there was no evidence that jury confusion led to an erroneous jury verdict. 
We therefore conclude that there were no evidentiary or 
prejudicial instructional errors resulting in jury confusion as to the existence of an exclusivity/radius restriction in the 2011 License Agreement, and that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying Appellants' motion for new trial on this basis. 
2. Weight of Evidence 
Gold Guys also argues that the circuit court erred when 
it entered judgment on the jury verdict awarding Appellants $1.00 in damages on its breach of contract counterclaim because the award was against the manifest weight of the evidence presented. Specifically, Gold Guys contends that it presented "undisputed evidence" of its loss of net profits and that Ward did not offer admissible evidence to refute Gold Guys' purported damages. 
At trial, Gold Guys had the burden of establishing its 
damages.  Gold Guys' purported evidence consisted of the testimonies of Gold Guys' Chief Financial Officer (Beasy) and Chief Executive Officer (Maguire), Gold Guys' financial records before and after Secured moved into Ward Warehouse, and the report and testimony of Loudat, as an expert witness in the field of economics. 
At trial, Appellants essentially argued that Gold Guys' 
performance during the time that Secured was at Ward Warehouse was lower than it would have been (based on Loudat's projections, which were in turn based on the historical performance of Gold Guys' Hawai# i operations) and that these losses were a 
foreseeable result of Ward's breach of the 2011 License Agreement.  On appeal, Appellants argue that Ward did not present any evidence to refute Gold Guys' evidence of the amount of "lost profits," and thus, because the amounts were not disputed, the jury verdict of nominal damages was against the manifest weight of the evidence. 
Although Ward indeed did not expressly refute or 
16           
   
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
challenge Gold Guys' decreased profits, Ward presented to the 
jury alternative explanations for the purported losses. Specifically, Ward leveraged testimony regarding: the peak of gold prices in mid-2011 and the steady decrease thereafter, Gold Guys' highest gross revenue month occurring in August 2011 (a few months after Secured had moved in to Ward Warehouse), Gold Guys' decline in revenue even after Secured left Ward Warehouse, and Gold Guys' alleged use of the second retail space in Ward Center (the subject of the 2011 License Agreement) as storage rather than a retail front.  Thus, contrary to Gold Guys' assertion, Ward did present substantial evidence that Gold Guys did not suffer anything more than nominal damages resulting from Ward's breach of the 2011 License Agreement. 
Although Gold Guys presented evidence of its damages, 
it is the jury's function, as fact-finder, to weigh the evidence presented before it and determine the credibility of the witnesses.  See Kato v. Funari, 118 Hawai# i 375, 381, 191 P.3d 
1052, 1058 (2008) ("[T]he well-settled principle in this jurisdiction [is] that 'the proper amount of damages to be awarded is within the exclusive province of the jury, since jurors are the sole judges of all disputed questions of fact.'" (Original brackets, ellipsis, and citation omitted)).  The jury's verdict of $1.00 indicates that the jury, upon review of the evidence presented to them at trial and in consideration of the jury instruction on breach of contract damages,  concluded that 
Gold Guys had been damaged by Ward's breach of the 2011 License Agreement but that Gold Guys did not meet its burden to prove the 
11
11 The circuit court gave the jury the following jury instruction on
breach of contract damages: 
The  measure  of  damages  for  a  breach  of  contract  is  the
amount  of  money  which  will  fairly  compensate  a  party  for
any  losses  caused  by  the  breach  which  were  reasonably
foreseeable  to  both  parties  at  the  time  they  entered
into  the  contract.   The  amount  of  damages  must  be  proved
with  reasonable  certainty  and  may  not  be  based  upon  mere
speculation  or  guess.   Any  damages  which  you  award  must
be  reasonable  in  amount.   If  a  party  has  been  damaged  by
the  breach,  but  did  not  prove  the  amount  of  damages  with
reasonable  certainty,  you  must  award  that  party  nominal
damages  in  the  amount  of  $1.00. 
(
Emphasis added).

          NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
amount of damages with reasonable certainty, over Ward's contrary 
evidence.  See Ferreira v. Honolulu Star-Bulletin, Ltd., 44 Haw. 567, 576, 356 P.2d 651, 656 (1960) ("To authorize a recovery of more than nominal damages, facts must exist and be shown by the evidence which afford a basis for measuring the plaintiff's loss with reasonable certainty.  The damages must be susceptible of ascertainment in some manner other than by mere speculation, conjecture, or surmise."). 
"[A trial court's] conclusion that a verdict is not 
against the weight of the evidence is sustained unless we are of the opinion that the undisputed evidence results in a verdict that is without legal support such that justice requires a new trial[.]"  Miyamoto v. Lum, 104 Hawai# i 1, 11, 84 P.3d 509, 519 
(2004) (citation omitted).  Here, there was enough evidence for the jury to conclude that Gold Guys' damages resulting from the breach of the 2011 License Agreement were not established to a reasonable certainty.  See Lyon v. Bush, 49 Haw. 116, 118, 412 P.2d 662, 664 (1966) (holding that an appellate court will not upset the denial of a motion for new trial if there is substantial evidence, more than a scintilla, to support the jury's verdict). 
Thus, we conclude that the circuit court did not abuse 
its discretion in denying Appellants' motion for new trial based on Appellants' contention that the jury verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence.
12 
We therefore affirm the 2/22/16 Judgment pursuant to 
the jury verdict and the circuit court's subsequent denial of Appellant's Motion for New Trial/Additur.  Accordingly, we need not address Ward's conditional points of errors regarding the circuit court's handling of matters during the jury trial (i.e., the circuit court's granting of Gold Guys' motion for partial summary judgment, denial of Ward's motion for summary judgment, and admission of Loudat's testimony). 
12 Appellants also contend that the circuit court erred in deeming
additur an unavailable and inappropriate remedy and correspondingly denying
Appellants' alternative motion for additur. Inasmuch as we conclude that the jury verdict was proper, we need not address Appellants' argument regarding thecircuit court's denial of additur as an available and appropriate remedy.

B. Attorneys' Fees, Costs, and Interest 
Appellants argue that Ward's Motion for Attorneys' 
Fees/Costs/Interest was deemed denied by operation of law under 
HRAP Rule 4(a)(3).  At the time Ward filed its motion for attorneys' fees, costs, and interest, HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) (2015) provided: 
(3) TIME TO APPEAL AFFECTED BY POST-JUDGMENT MOTIONS.  If 
any party files a timely motion for judgment as a matter of
law, to amend findings or make additional findings, for anew trial, to reconsider, alter or amend the judgment ororder, or for attorney's fees or costs, the time for filingthe notice of appeal is extended until 30 days after entryof an order disposing of the motion; provided, that thefailure to dispose of any motion by order entered upon therecord within 90 days after the date the motion was filedshall constitute a denial of the motion. 
(Emphasis added).   This rule "provides that the court has 90 
days to dispose of a [post-judgment tolling motion], regardless 
of when the notice of appeal is filed."  Buscher v. Boning, 114 Hawai# i 202, 221, 159 P.3d 814, 833 (2007).  A post-judgment 
motion is deemed denied by operation of law when the trial court fails to enter an order on the motion within ninety days after the motion was filed.  Cty of Haw. v. C & J Coupe Family Ltd. P'ship, 119 Hawai# i 352, 367, 198 P.3d 615, 630 (2008). 13
Here, the circuit court entered judgment on 
February 22, 2016, and Ward's Motion for Attorneys' Fees/Costs/Interest was timely filed on February 23, 2016.  The 90-day time period established by HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) expired on May 23, 2016, at which point Ward's Motion for Attorneys' Fees/Costs/Interest was deemed denied by operation of law.  See HRAP Rule 26 (computation of periods of time prescribed by HRAP). However, the circuit court did not enter an order on the motion until July 19, 2016, over a month past the 90-day deadline.  The circuit court did not have the authority to grant the post-judgment motion after the ninetieth day after February 23, 2016, and the Order Granting Ward's Motion for Attorneys' Fees/Costs/Interest was thus a nullity for purposes of awarding

fees, costs, and interest.  See Century Campus Hous. Mgmt., L.P.
v. Elda Hana, LLC, Nos. CAAP-15-0000020, CAAP-15-0000470, 2018 WL 637373, at *18 (Haw. App. Jan. 31, 2018) (mem. op.); In re Int'l Union of Painters & Allied Trades, Painters Local Union 1791 v. Endo Painting Serv. Inc., Nos. CAAP-12-0000661, CAAP-12-0001094, CAAP-13-0000187, 2015 WL 3649836, at *4 (Haw. App. June 10, 2015) (mem. op.). 
For the same reasons, the circuit court's July 19, 2016 
Order Granting Gold Guys' Motion for Costs was also a nullity because it was entered more than ninety days after Gold Guys' Motion for Costs was filed on March 3, 2016. 
We therefore vacate the Order Granting Ward's Motion 
for Attorneys' Fees/Costs/Interest and the Order Granting Gold Guys' Motion for Costs.  Accordingly, we need not address the parties' remaining arguments regarding the award of attorneys' fees, costs, and interest.  Our conclusion that the motions for attorneys' fees and costs were deemed denied does not preclude the circuit court from addressing these issues on remand.  We remand the case so that both parties may re-assert their claims for attorneys' fees, costs, and interest without prejudice from the deemed denial of their previous motions.  See C & J Coupe, 119 Hawai# i at 367–68, 198 P.3d at 630–31;  In re Int'l Union of 
Painters & Allied Trades, 2015 WL 3649836, at *5-6. 
C. 8/17/16 Judgment 
Appellants seek to vacate the 8/17/16 Judgment because 
it incorporated the circuit court's untimely and null award of 
attorneys' fees, costs, and prejudgment interest, and because it was not needed in light of the 2/22/16 Judgment. 
The 8/17/16 Judgment addresses matters beyond the items 
contained in the 2/22/16 Judgment, including awards for attorneys' fees, costs, and pre- and post-judgment interest.  As we previously ruled in an order issued on September 29, 2016, the original 2/22/16 Judgment is a final appealable judgment under Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai# i 115, 119, 
869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994).  The 2/22/16 Judgment resolved all substantive claims by all parties, despite leaving the attorneys' fees, costs, and prejudgment interest unresolved.  See HRCP Rule 
20 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
58 ("The entry of the judgment shall not be delayed for the 
taxing of costs."); CRSC, Inc. v. Sage Diamond Co., Inc., 95 Hawai# i 301, 307, 22 P.3d 97, 103 (App. 2001) ("The entry of 
judgment and taxation of costs are separate legal acts." (Citation, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted)). 
On March 22, 2016, Gold Guys filed a notice of appeal 
from the 2/22/16 Judgment and "[g]enerally, the filing of a notice of appeal divests the trial court of jurisdiction over the appealed case."  TSA Int'l Ltd. v. Shimizu Corp., 92 Hawai# i 243, 
265, 990 P.2d 713, 735 (1999) (citations omitted).   One 
exception is that, under HRAP Rule 4(a)(3), the circuit court retained jurisdiction for ninety days to resolve any timely post-judgment motions set forth in that rule.  See Buscher, 114 Hawai# i at 221, 159 P.3d at 833 (holding that HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) 
"provides that the court has 90 days to dispose of a postjudgment motion for costs, regardless of when the notice of appeal is filed." (emphasis added)). 
14
As discussed above, the circuit court failed to rule on 
Ward's Motion for Attorneys' Fees/Costs/Interest and Gold Guys' Motion for Costs in the required ninety days.  Thus, the orders on those motions, as well as the inclusion of those items in the 8/17/16 Judgment, are a nullity.  Furthermore, given the notice of appeal filed on March 22, 2016, the circuit court had no 
14 The  record  does  not  indicate  why  the  8/17/16  Judgment  was  entered
and  thus  another  reason  that  this  judgment  may  be  invalid  is  the  ruling  in  Wong
v.  Wong,  79  Hawai #i  26,  29-30,  897  P.2d  953,  956-57  (1995),  stating: 
[T]he  circuit  courts  are  now  governed  by  the  Hawai #i  Rules  o f 
Civil  Procedure.   Those  rules  set  forth  the  circumstances 
under  and  the  times  within  which  the  circuit  courts  may  take
actions  to  review  and  set  aside  their  own  judgments,  see HRCP
50,  52(b),  59,  and  60,  and  a  rule,  HRCP  6(b),  that
specifically  limits  the  granting  of  extensions  of  time  to  take
such  actions.   Once  a  valid  judgment  is  entered,  the  only
means  by  which  a  circuit  court  may  thereafter  alter  or  amend
it  is  by  appropriate  motion  under  HRCP  59(e). 
(Emphasis  added)  (footnote  and  citation  omitted).   But  see Wiesenberg  v.  Univ.  of 
Hawai #i,  138  H awai #i  210,  378  P.3d  926  (2016)  (recognizing  an  amended  judgment
that  was  materially  and  substantially  different  from  an  original  judgment  and
entered  without  reference  to  any  particular  HRCP  rule,  as  the  judgment  from  which
to  determine  whether  an  appeal  was  timely).   Wiesenberg  did  not  involve  a  notice
of  appeal  from  the  original  judgment  and  thus  is  distinguishable  from  this  case.  
However,  given  Wiesenberg,  it  is  unclear  if  the  quoted  passage  from  Wong  remains
applicable.

jurisdiction to enter the 8/17/16 Judgment. 
We thus vacate the 8/17/16 Judgment based on the 
circuit court's lack of jurisdiction.  See Koga Eng'g & Const.,
Inc. v. State, 122 Hawai# i 60, 84, 222 P.3d 979, 1003 (2010) 
("[W]hen reviewing a case where the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, the appellate court retains jurisdiction, not on the merits, but for the purpose of correcting the error in jurisdiction." (Citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).
V. CONCLUSION 
Based on the foregoing, we AFFIRM the February 22, 2016 
Judgment and VACATE the July 19, 2016 Order Granting Ward's Motion for Award of Attorneys' Fees, Costs, and Prejudgment Interest; the July 19, 2016 Order Granting Gold Guys' Motion for Costs; and the August 17, 2016 Final Judgment, entered in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit.  We remand the case for the parties to assert or re-assert their claims for attorneys' fees, costs, and interest.
