STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
MARK WILSON, Defendant-Appellee
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CR. NO. 15-1-0923)
MEMORANDUM OPINION
(By: Reifurth, Presiding Judge, and Ginoza and Chan, JJ.)
Plaintiff-Appellant State of Hawai #i appeals from the
February 22, 2016 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order
Granting Defendant's Motion to Dismiss for Violation of Rule 48
("February 22, 2016 Order"), entered by the Circuit Court of the
First Circuit1/ ("Circuit Court").  For the reasons explained
below, we vacate the February 22, 2016 Order and remand the case
to the Circuit Court.
I. BACKGROUND
On May 28, 2015, Defendant-Appellee Mark Wilson
("Wilson") was arrested on suspicion of Abuse of Family or
Household Members and released with a 48-hour warning to stay
away from the complaining witness.2/  On May 30, 2015, Wilson was
suspected of having violated his 48-hour warning and arrested on
1/The Honorable Dean E. Ochiai presided.
2/To the extent that the Circuit Court's first finding of fact
suggests that bail was set for the May 28, 2015 arrest on or about that date,
it is clearly erroneous, as the record is uncontroverted that bail on that
count was not set until June 18, 2015, and Wilson concedes in his answering
brief that it was not set at the time he was charged.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
suspicion of Terroristic Threatening in the First Degree.
On June 2, 2015, a complaint was filed in the District
Court of the First Circuit charging Wilson with Terroristic
Threatening in the First Degree in violation of Hawaii Revised
Statutes ("HRS") section 707-716(1)(f)(ii) and bail was set in
the amount of $50,000.  On June 4, 2015, the District Court
committed the case to the Circuit Court for further proceedings
and on June 9, 2015, a complaint was filed in the Circuit Court
charging Wilson with Terroristic Threatening in the First Degree
(count 1), and Abuse of Family or Household Member in violation
of HRS section 709-906(1) and (5) (count 2).  On June 18, 2015,
bail was aggregated, and the $50,000 bail on count 1 was
aggregated to include count 2.
Trial was originally scheduled for the week of
August 17, 2015.  However, at the August 10, 2015 trial call, the
State and Wilson stipulated to a continuance, and a new trial
date was set for the week of October 12, 2015.  
On October 12, 2015, the State requested a continuance,
which was granted, and a new trial date was set for the week of
January 19, 2016.  At the January 13, 2016 trial call, defense
counsel requested a continuance, which was granted, because a key
witness for the defense was unavailable to testify.  At the
January 21, 2016 trial call, defense counsel informed the court
that the defense was again not ready to proceed to trial due to
the continued unavailability of a material witness while Wilson
stood on his refusal to waive his Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure
("HRPP") Rule 48 rights.  The court invited Wilson to file a Rule
48 motion to dismiss and said that trial would be re-set
immediately after hearing on such a motion if it was denied.
On January 29, 2016, Wilson filed a motion to dismiss,
which the Circuit Court granted without prejudice.3/  The State
3/HRPP Rule 48 provides, in pertinent part: 
(b)By court.   Except in the case of traffic offenses
that are not punishable by imprisonment, the court shall, on
motion of the defendant, dismiss the charge, with or without
prejudice in its discretion, if trial is not commenced within
six months:

timely appealed.
II. POINTS OF ERROR
On appeal, we construe the State's sole point of error
to be that the Circuit Court improperly calculated the excludable
days under HRPP Rule 48(c)(3), specifically the days between
January 13, 2016 and January 29, 2016, because it was defense
counsel who requested the continuance in question.4/
3/(...continued)
(1) from the date of arrest if bail is set or from the
filing of the charge, whichever is sooner, on any offense
based on the same conduct or arising from the same criminal
episode for which the arrest or charge was made[.]
. . . .
(c)Excluded periods.   The following periods shall be
excluded in computing the time for trial commencement:
. . . .
(3) periods that delay the commencement of trial and
are caused by a continuance granted at the request or with the
consent of the defendant or defendant's counsel;
. . . .
(d)Per se excludable and includable periods of time
for purposes of subsection (c)(1) of this rule.
(1) For purposes of subsection (c)(1) of this rule,
the period of time, from the filing through the prompt
disposition of the following motions filed by a defendant,
shall be deemed to be periods of delay resulting from
collateral or other proceedings concerning the defendant:
motions to dismiss, to suppress, for voluntariness hearing
heard before trial, to sever counts or defendants, for
disqualification of the prosecutor, for withdrawal of counsel
including the time period for appointment of new counsel if so
ordered, for mental examination, to continue trial, for
transfer to the circuit court, for remand from the circuit
court, for change of venue, to secure the attendance of a
witness by a material witness order, and to secure the
attendance of a witness from without the state.
Haw. R. Pen. P. 48.
4/Specifically, the State challenges as wrong as a matter of law,
Conclusions of Law Nos. 3 and 4 which read:
3. Defense counsel's request for continuance of the January
19, 2016 trial week, orally made on January 13, 2016,
and renewed on January 21, 2016, is not excludable under
HRPP Rule 48(c)(3) or HRPP Rule 48(d)(1), as Defendant
refused to waive his Speedy trial and HRPP Rule 48
rights.

III. STANDARD OF REVIEW
HRPP Rule 48 Determinations
The appellate court reviews a trial court's decision on
an HRPP Rule 48 motion to dismiss under both the "clearly
erroneous" and "right/wrong" tests:
A trial court's findings of fact (FOFs) in
deciding an HRPP 48(b) motion to dismiss are
subject to the clearly erroneous standard of
review.  An FOF is clearly erroneous when, despite
evidence to support the finding, the appellate
court is left with the definite and firm
conviction that a mistake has been committed. 
However, whether those facts fall within HRPP
48(b)'s exclusionary provisions is a question of
law, the determination of which is freely
reviewable pursuant to the "right/wrong" test.  
State v. Samonte , 83 Hawai #i 507, 514, 928 P.2d 1, 8 (1996)
(quoting State v. Hutch, 75 Haw. 307, 328-29, 861 P.2d 11, 22
(1993)).
IV. DISCUSSION
After the Circuit Court concluded that the days between
January 13, 2016 and January 29, 2016 were not excludable, it
further concluded that more than 180 non-excludable days had
elapsed in violation of HRPP Rule 48(b) and granted Wilson's
motion to dismiss. 
HRPP Rule 48(b)(1) mandates the dismissal of an
indictment if the trial has not begun within six months of the
arrest if bail is set, excluding those permissible periods of
delay under HRPP Rule 48(c).  "Pursuant to HRPP 48(c), certain
periods must be excluded from the computation of the six months
period[.]"  State v. Hoey , 77 Hawai #i 17, 28, 881 P.2d 504, 515
(1994) (holding that before days will be excludable, they must
result in "actual delay" in the trial); see also State v.
Jackson, 81 Hawai #i 39, 51–52, 912 P.2d 71, 83–84 (1996) (holding
that it was proper to exclude fifteen days attributable to

have elapsed since Defendant's arrest and the case
must be dismissed pursuant to HRPP Rule 48(b)(1).
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
defense counsel's failure to appear at a pretrial status
conference).  When calculating whether trial was commenced within
the 180-day time period, it is necessary to identify all
excludable periods.  Haw. R. Pen. P. 48(c); State v. Diaz , 100
Hawai#i 210, 222, 58 P.3d 1257, 1269 (2002) ("[T]o determine
whether dismissal was required under HRPP Rule 48, the start date
and all excludable periods must be identified.") (citing State v.
Dwyer, 78 Hawai #i 367, 893 P.2d 795 (1995). 
A.
Abuse of Family or Household Members (count 2)
As to this charge, Wilson concedes that he was not in
custody and bail had not previously been set on count 2 when he
was formally charged by Complaint on June 9, 2015; that,
therefore, 180 days had not elapsed for the charge of Abuse of
Family or Household Members; and that the Circuit Court's
subsequent conclusion, therefore, was clearly erroneous as it
related to count 2.  We concur in Wilson's analysis, accept his
concession, and proceed to consider the court's ruling as to
count 1. 
B. Charge of Terroristic Threatening (count 1)
On May 30, 2015, Wilson was arrested on suspicion of
Terroristic Threatening in the First Degree.  He remained under
arrest until bail was set on June 2, 2015 at $50,000.  Bail was
later aggregated on June 18, 2015 to include both counts.  The
effective start date of the 180-day period under Rule 48(b)(1) is
May 30, 2015, because that was the date that Wilson was arrested
and held until bail was set.  Between May 30, 2015 and January
29, 2016 when the Rule 48 motion was filed, 244 days had elapsed.
The State and Wilson stipulated to a continuance from August 10,
2015 to October 12, 2015, amounting to 63 days.  Accordingly,
under HRPP Rule 48(c), a total of 63 days must be subtracted from
244 days for a total of 181 days.
Neither party appears to contest that if the days
between January 13, 2016, and the hearing on Wilson's Rule 48
motion are excluded, the court erred in dismissing the case under
HRPP Rule 48.  The critical issue on appeal as to count 1,
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
therefore, is the State's argument that those days should have
been excluded under HRPP Rule 48(c)(3).  As the State's argument
relates to specific periods of inclusion or exclusion, we review
the Circuit Court's conclusion under the right/wrong standard. 
Samonte, 83 Hawai #i at 514, 928 P.2d at 8.
Here, defense counsel requested a continuance on
January 13, 2016, which was repeated at the January 21, 2016
trial call, and which was granted in each instance, due to the
unavailability of a critical defense witness.  Although Wilson
was not present at the trial call on January 13, 2016, he was
present at the trial call on January 21, 2016, and although his
refusal to waive his HRPP Rule 48 rights was conveyed by his
counsel to the court at the time of each request, there is no
requirement under the plain language of the rule that the
defendant himself must agree to the continuance.  Haw. R. Pen. P.
48(c)(3).  Indeed, HRPP Rule 48(c)(3) is clear and it "only
requires consent from either the defendant or the defendant's
counsel."  Diaz, 100 Hawai #i at 223, 58 P.3d at 1270; see also
Samonte, 83 Hawai #i at 516, 928 P.2d at 10 (excluding days under
HRPP Rule 48(c)(3) due to counsel's request to continue trial
without regard to defendant's presence or agreement); State v.
Hilario, No. CAAP-13-0003039, 2016 WL 1092608, at *6 (Hawai# i
App. Mar. 28, 2016) (holding that "Rule 48 does not appear to
require a request or consent of a defendant, so long as his or
her attorney moves for a continuance."). 
Wilson argues that Diaz is distinguishable, on the
grounds that in Diaz  both the defendant and defense counsel were
present at the time of counsel's request for a continuance,
whereas in the instant case, only defense counsel was present.
Wilson further argues that defense counsel must first inform the
defendant before requesting to continue trial and to do otherwise
"would not serve HRPP Rule 48's purpose of efficiency and
fairness."  According to Wilson, "[a] defendant should have the
right to know whether or not his trial will be delayed" because
"the defendant may wish to proceed even if a defense witness is
unavailable." 
6NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
To accept Wilson's argument would be to ignore the
plain language of Rule 48 and the cases that have interpreted the
provision in question, which we decline to do.  Further, to allow
a trial continuance at defense counsel's request, but then count
the delayed period against the State if the defendant refuses to
waive the time under HRPP Rule 48, would create an unfair
circumstance for the State and undermine the proper functioning
of HRPP Rule 48.  Accordingly, the days between January 13, 2016,
and January 29, 2016, should have been excluded for the purposes
of calculating the number of days elapsed under HRPP Rule 48, and
the Circuit Court erred in failing to do so.
V. DISPOSITION
Based on the foregoing, we vacate the February 22, 2016
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Granting
Defendant's Motion to Dismiss for Violation of Rule 48 and remand
for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
