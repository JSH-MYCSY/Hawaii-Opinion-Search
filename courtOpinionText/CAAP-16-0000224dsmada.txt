(1) The opening brief was due on a third extension of
 
time on or before September 14, 2016;
 
(2) Defendant-Appellant Jennifer Lauren Moore
 
(Appellant), pro se, failed to file the opening brief, or request
 
another extension of time;
 
(3) Appellee seeks to dismiss the appeal, pursuant to 
Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 30, because 
Appellant failed to file the opening brief; 
(4) On December 14, 2016, the appellate clerk notified
 
Appellant that the time for filing the opening brief had expired
 and, pursuant to HRAP Rule 30, the matter would be called to the
 court’s attention on December 27, 2016, for appropriate action,
 which could include dismissal of the appeal; and 
(5) Appellant took no further action in the appeal.
 Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is
 
granted and the appeal is dismissed.
