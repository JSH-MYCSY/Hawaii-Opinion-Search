(CIVIL NO. 15-1-1696)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Ginoza and Chan, JJ.)
Plaintiff-Appellant Donna H. Yamamoto ( Yamamoto)
appeals from the Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part
Defendants David W.H. Chee [( Chee)] and Tom Chee Watts
Degele-Mathews & Yoshida, LLP's [(TCW )] Motion:  (1) to Dismiss
Plaintiff's Complaint for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction and
for Failure to State a Claim Upon which Relief can be Granted;
(2) to Compel the Binding Arbitration of all Claims in
Plaintiff's Complaint; and (3) for an Award of Attorneys' Fees
and Costs Filed December 16, 2015 ( Order Compelling Arbitration),NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
which was entered on March 9, 2016, in the Circuit Court of the
First Circuit.1 
On appeal, Yamamoto raises two points of error,
contending that the Circuit Court erred:  (1) when it concluded
that the conversion of her funds fell within the scope of the
arbitration clause in the partnership agreement; and (2) when it
purportedly determined that strict compliance with the notice
requirements of Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 658A-9 was not
required before filing a motion to compel arbitration. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, as well as the
relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Yamamoto's points of
error as follows: 
(1) Yamamoto contends that her claims do not fall
within the scope of the arbitration clause of the subject
partnership agreement.  Whether an issue is beyond the scope of a
contractual agreement to arbitrate "depends on the wording of the
contractual agreement to arbitrate."  Cty. of Hawaii v. UNIDEV,
LLC, 129 Hawai #i 378, 394, 301 P.3d 588, 604 (2013), (citation
and quotation marks omitted).  "Under Hawai #i law, any doubts
concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in
favor of arbitration."  Id.  (citation and internal quotation
marks omitted).  Here, the arbitration clause states in part:
1The Honorable Edwin C. Nacino presided.
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
In the event of any dispute between or among the Partners in
connection with  this Agreement, such dispute shall be
resolved by arbitration. . . .
(Emphasis added).  
Thus, the phrase that defines the scope in this
arbitration clause is the phrase "in connection with."  Other
courts have construed "in connection with" broadly when
addressing arbitration clauses.  See , e.g., Simula, Inc. v.
Autoliv, Inc. , 175 F.3d 716, 721 (9th Cir. 1999) (Every court
that has construed the phrase 'arising in connection with' in an
arbitration clause has interpreted that language broadly.");2
Coffman v. Provost * Umphrey Law Firm, L.L.P. , 161 F. Supp. 2d
720, 725 (E.D. Tex. 2001), aff'd sub nom. Coffman v. Provost
Umphrey LLP, 33 F.Appx 705 (5th Cir. 2002) ("A broad arbitration
clause, on the other hand, includes . . . disputes that are 'in
connection with' the agreement.").  
Here, because the arbitration clause applies to
disputes "in connection with" the partnership agreement, we
construe the scope of the arbitration clause broadly.
Accordingly, to require arbitration, "factual allegations need
only 'touch matters' covered by the contract containing the
arbitration clause[.]"  See Simula , 175 F.3d at 721 (citation
omitted).  
With this in mind, we turn to whether Yamamoto's claims
fall within the scope of the subject arbitration clause. 
2Most case law nationwide deals with the phrase "arising in
connection with" or "arising out of and in connection with."  To the extent
that the phrase "arising in connection with" which is used in Simula, differs
slightly from the phrase "in connection with," which is used in the instant
case, we see no basis for distinction for purposes of this case.  
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
"Whether a claim falls within the scope of an arbitration
agreement turns on the factual allegations in the complaint." 
UNIDEV, LLC , 129 Hawai #i at 396, 301 P.3d at 606 (citation
omitted).  In UNIDEV, the Hawai #i Supreme Court analyzed a
contract concerning the construction of affordable housing.  The
supreme court held that the following factual allegations
"[arose] under" the contract:  
that (1) Petitioners submitted invoices that demanded
payment for services for which Petitioner had already
received payment, (2) Petitioners submitted invoices which
misrepresented that funds would be used to pay contractors,
(3) Petitioners submitted invoices that Respondent was not
required to pay, (4) Petitioners made misrepresentations to
induce Respondent to provide funding to the Project. . . .
Id. at 394, 396, 301 P.3d at 604, 606-07.  
Here, whether Yamamoto's claims are "in connection
with" the partnership agreement depends on the factual
allegations, and not necessarily on the characterization of the
counts alleged in Yamamoto's complaint.  See id.  at 396, 301 P.3d
at 606.  In short, Yamamoto alleges that: (1) Chee debited her
partnership capital account without her consent; (2) Chee
concealed the fact that Yamamoto's loan was repaid out of her
partnership capital account, still accepted her personal check
and used it for purposes other than repaying the 401k loan; and
(3) neither Chee nor TCW have returned the funds, despite
numerous demands from Yamamoto.
We conclude that these allegations "touch matters"
covered by the partnership agreement:  namely, the handling of
Yamamoto's partnership capital account.  See Simula , 175 F.3d at
721.  Furthermore, we find the instant case to be similar to that
in UNIDEV.  129 Hawai #i at 396-97, 301 P.3d at 606-07.  Whereas
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
in UNIDEV , the supreme court held that allegations of fraudulent
billing were arbitrable under the contract at issue, see id. at
396, 301 P.3d at 606, Yamamoto's allegations of conversion and
fraudulent conversion are similarly arbitrable here.3  Therefore,
we conclude that the Circuit Court did not err in concluding that
the factual allegations in Yamamoto's Complaint fall within the
scope of the arbitration clause.  
(2) Yamamoto argues that Chee and TCW failed to give
proper notice because:  (1) the January 12, 2016 letter demanding
arbitration did not "describe the nature of the controversy and
the remedy sought" as required by HRS § 658A-9; and (2) it was
sent after the motion to compel arbitration was filed.  Chee and
TCW contend that they complied with HRS § 658A-9 when they
emailed Yamamoto's counsel prior to the filing of the motion to
compel and then sent the January 12, 2016 letter.
HRS § 658A-9(a) (2016) requires that the notice
"describe the nature of the controversy and the remedy sought." 
We agree with Yamamoto that this requirement applies to persons
seeking to defend claims through arbitration, as well as persons
seeking to prosecute claims.  See Ueoka v. Szymanski, 107 Hawai# i
386, 395, 114 P.3d 892, 901 (2005). 
 Chee and TCW's January 12, 20164 letter stated, in
relevant part:
3We note that the phrase "in connection with" which is used in the
instant case, suggests a broader scope than the phrase "arising under," which
was used in UNIDEV.  See Simula, 175 F.3d at 721 (citation omitted)
(discussing the phrase "arising in connection with"); UNIDEV, 129 Hawai #i at
394, 301 P.3d at 604.
4The year stated on the letter was 2015, however, it appears that
the correct date should have been January 12, 2016. 
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
This letter represents Defendants' written demand for
arbitration of Plaintiff's Complaint filed August 27, 2015
under 13.10 of the Partnership Agreement. This written
demand for arbitration is being sent pursuant to Haw. Rev.
Stat. §658-9.
A copy of the November 27, 2015 email was attached to
the letter and stated, in relevant part: 
I have reviewed the Partnership Agreement which was signed
by your client Donna Yamamoto and conclude that Article
XIII, section 13.10 which is entitled Arbitration mandates
that your client submit her dispute with the partnership and
David Chee to arbitration. . . . For that reason, on behalf
of my clients, I must request that your client dismiss her
Complaint and submit this matter to arbitration pursuant to
the section in the Partnership Agreement which I have so
noted above. 
. . . . If your client refuses to dismiss her Complaint, I
will be required to file a motion to dismiss [and] will seek
to recover attorney's fees and costs associated with the
filing of the motion.
The written notice requirement in the Uniform
Arbitration Act, upon which HRS chapter 658A is based, "serves as
the functional equivalent of notice pleading in a court action." 
Block v. Plosia , 390 N.J. Super. 543, 554, 916 A.2d 475, 482
(App. Div. 2007).  Notice pleading only requires "a short and
plain statement of the claim that provides defendant with fair
notice of what the plaintiff's claim is and the grounds upon
which the claim rests[.]"  Laeroc Waikiki Parkside, LLC v. K.S.K.
(Oahu) Ltd. P'ship, 115 Hawai #i 201, 215-16, n. 17, 166 P.3d 961,
975-76, n. 17, (2007) (citations omitted).  
Here, the January 12, 2016 letter stated that Chee and
TCW were demanding arbitration of "Plaintiff's Complaint filed
August 27, 2015."  The attached copy of the earlier email further
communicated that Defendants sought to resolve the claims in
Yamamoto's Complaint by arbitration, pursuant to the subject
arbitration agreement.  Thusly, Chee and TCW notified Yamamoto of
6NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
what they wanted to arbitrate.  As there were no counterclaims or
other claims for relief against Yamamoto, no other notice of
relief or remedy needed to be stated.  Accordingly, we conclude
that Chee and TCW sufficiently "describe[d] the nature of the
controversy and the remedy sought."  See  HRS § 658A-9(a).
Yamamoto also contends that the timing of Chee and
TCW's notice rendered it defective because the January 12, 2016
letter was sent after Chee and TCW filed their motion to compel
arbitration on December 16, 2015, albeit before the Circuit
Court's hearing on the motion to compel and the court's
subsequent Order Compelling Arbitration.
HRS § 658A-9(a) provides, in relevant part:
(a)  A person initiates an arbitration proceeding by
giving notice in a record to the other parties to the
agreement to arbitrate in the agreed manner between the
parties or, in the absence of agreement, by certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested and obtained, or
by service as authorized for the commencement of a civil
action.
Yamamoto relies on the supreme court's decision in
Ueoka, cited above, to argue that formal notice must be given
prior to the filing of a motion to compel.  We reject Yamamoto's
contention that Ueoka mandates the denial of a motion to compel
where notice is given, but given after the filing of the motion
to compel.  
The circumstances in Ueoka are distinguishable because,
in Ueoka, "[d]espite the circuit court's stated willingness to
reconsider the stay issue if a demand for arbitration was filed,
neither Szymanski nor Hartley ever made a demand for arbitration
at any time."  Ueoka, 107 Hawai #i at 395, 114 P.3d at 901
(emphasis added).  Unlike the defendants in Ueoka, Chee and TCW
7NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
sent a formal notice when confronted with the infirmities of
their verbal and email demands for arbitration.  In addition, the
dissent in Ueoka opined that, once a suit was filed, it was
unnecessary to comply with the notice requirements of HRS § 658A-
9 before moving to compel arbitration.  Id. at 398-99, 114 P.3d
at 904-05.  Responding to the dissent, and declining to dispense
with the formal notice requirement after suit was filed, the
majority explained, in part:
[T]his court has advocated the use of arbitration in an
effort to reduce the number of cases that proceed to
litigation. [W]e emphasize the importance of utilizing
alternative methods of dispute resolution in an effort to
reduce the growing number of cases that crowd our courts
each year.  Allowing a party to compel arbitration after
filing a lawsuit (without filing a notice initiating
arbitration) does nothing to avoid litigation or reduce the
number of cases crowding our courts.  As such, we believe
that requiring a party to initiate arbitration before filing
a motion to compel arbitration best supports the policy
reasons behind encouraging arbitration.
Id. at 395, 114 P.3d at 901 (citation, quotation marks, and
parentheses omitted).
Thus, although opining that initiating arbitration
before filing a motion to compel "best supports" the statute's
rationale, the supreme court was not asked to decide whether it
was reversible error to allow a party, effectively, to cure a
lack of a proper HRS § 658A-9 notice before the filing of a
motion to compel.  We conclude that, under the circumstances of
this case, the Circuit Court did not err in considering Chee and
TCW's January 12, 2016 letter to satisfy the HRS § 658A-9
requirements to initiate arbitration and that this conclusion is
not inconsistent with the holding in Ueoka.  Rather, it appears
that requiring a motion to compel arbitration to be denied, a new
demand to be made, and then a new motion to compel to be filed,
8NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
would be inconsistent with the policy considerations stated by
the supreme court and the statutory requirements to initiate
arbitration. 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's March 9, 2016
Order Compelling Arbitration is affirmed.
