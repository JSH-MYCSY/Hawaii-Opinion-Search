 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to the Gundersons' July 13, 2016 motion, and (3) the record, it 
appears that under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2015), we have appellate jurisdiction over Elder's appeal to the limited extent that he seeks appellate review of the Honorable Ronald Ibarra's March 10, 2016 post-judgment order denying Elder's January 14, 2016 post-judgment motion for relief under Rule 60(b) of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) 
from the December 17, 2015 amended judgment in Civil No. 11-1­088K. However, Elder's appeal and the Gundersons' cross-appeal are both untimely under Rules 4(a)(1) and 4.1(b)(1) of the Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP), respectively, as to 
the December 17, 2015 amended judgment and all preceding interlocutory orders in Civil No. 11-1-088K. 
We initially note that Elder's March 30, 2016 notice of
 
appeal designates the following three documents for appellate
 review:
 
(1) the December 17, 2015 amended judgment;
 
(2) a December 17, 2015 interlocutory order; and
 
(3) the March 10, 2016 post-judgment order denying
Elder's January 14, 2016 post-judgment motion for
HRCP Rule 60(b) relief from the December 17, 2015
amended judgment. 
The Gundersons' April 13, 2016 notice of cross-appeal designates
 
 
the following three documents for appellate review:
 
 
(1) the December 17, 2015 amended judgment;
 
(2) an October 31, 2014 findings of fact, conclusions
of law and interlocutory order from the bench
trial in Civil No. 11-1-088K; and
 
(3) a September 23, 2013 interlocutory order.
 
The December 17, 2015 amended judgment resolved all claims

NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
against all parties in Civil No. Civil No. 11-1-088K, and, thus, 
the December 17, 2015 amended judgment was an immediately appealable final judgment under HRS § 641-1(a), HRCP Rule 58, and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). A timely appeal 
under HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) from the December 17, 2015 amended judgment would entitle the appealing party to appellate review of all preceding interlocutory orders under the principle that "[a]n appeal from a final judgment brings up for review all interlocutory orders not appealable directly as of right which deal with issues in the case." Ueoka v Szymanski, 107 Hawai
'i 
386, 396, 114 P.3d 892, 902 (2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). However, Elder did not file his March 30, 2016 notice of appeal within thirty days after entry of the December 17, 2015 amended judgment, as HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) required for a timely appeal from the December 17, 2015 amended judgment. 
1
HRAP Rule 4(a)(3)  enables a party to extend the
 
initial thirty-day time period under HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) for filing
 a notice of appeal by filing a "timely" post-judgment tolling
 motion. For example, if any party had filed an HRCP Rule 59
 post-judgment motion for reconsideration within ten days after
 
1
 Rule 4(a)(3) of the Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure provides: 
(3) Time to Appeal Affected by Post-Judgment Motions.
If any party files a timely motion for judgment as a matter
of law, to amend findings or make additional findings, for a
new trial, to reconsider, alter or amend the judgment or
order, or for attorney's fees or costs, the time for filing
the notice of appeal is extended until 30 days after entry
of an order disposing of the motion; provided that the
failure to dispose of any motion by order entered upon the
record within 90 days after the date the motion was filed
shall constitute a denial of the motion.

entry of the December 17, 2015 amended judgment, then the time period for filing a notice of appeal from the December 17, 2015 amended judgment would have been extended under HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) until thirty days after entry of the post-judgment order that disposes of the post-judgment motion. 
Elder filed a January 14, 2016 post-judgment motion for 
HRCP Rule 60(b) relief from the December 17, 2015 amended judgment, but that motion was not a timely filed tolling motion pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). As a general rule, a motion brought under HRCP Rule 60(b) is not a tolling motion that extends the time to file a notice of appeal. Simbajon v. Gentry, 
81 Hawai
'i 193, 196, 914 P.3d 1386, 1389 (App. 1996). An 
exception to that general rule exists if the circumstances allow the circuit court to treat the HRCP Rule 60(b) post-judgment motion as a HRCP Rule 59 post-judgment motion. In this circumstance, "[a]n HRCP Rule 60(b) motion for relief from judgment may toll the period for appealing a judgment or order, but only if the motion is served and filed within ten (10) days after the judgment is entered." Lambert v. Lua, 92 Hawai
'i 228, 
234, 990 P.2d 126, 132 (App.1999) (citation omitted). 
Here Elder did not file his January 14, 2016 post-
judgment motion for HRCP Rule 60(b) relief within ten days after
 entry of the December 17, 2015 amended judgment, as HRCP Rule 59
 required for a "timely" post-judgment motion. Therefore, Elder's
 January 14, 2016 post-judgment motion for HRCP Rule 60(b) relief
 did not toll the thirty day time period for filing a notice of
 appeal from the December 17, 2015 amended judgment. Consequently,
 Elder's March 30, 2016 notice of appeal is untimely under

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) as to the December 17, 2015 amended judgment and all preceding interlocutory orders. 
HRAP Rule 4.1(a) provides that "[i]f a party files a
 
timely notice of appeal, any other party may . . . file a cross-
appeal." (Emphasis added). The Gundersons did not file their
 April 13, 2016 notice of cross-appeal in response to a timely
 notice of appeal of the December 17, 2015 amended judgment or
 within thirty days after entry of the December 17, 2015 amended
 judgment. Therefore, the Gundersons' cross-appeal is likewise
 untimely as to the December 17, 2015 amended judgment and all
 preceding interlocutory orders. 
The failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a
 
civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot
 waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise
 of judicial discretion. Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727
 
P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or
 justice is authorized to change the jurisdictional requirements
 contained in Rule 4 of these rules.") Consequently, we lack
 appellate jurisdiction to review the December 17, 2015 amended
 judgment and all preceding interlocutory orders.
 
Unlike the Gundersons, Elder additionally seeks 
appellate review of the March 10, 2016 post-judgment order denying Elder's January 14, 2016 post-judgment motion for HRCP Rule 60(b) relief, which, under HRS § 641-1(a), is an independently appealable final post-judgment order. Ditto v. 
McCurdy, 103 Hawai
'i 153, 160, 80 P.3d 974, 981 (2003); Bailey v. 
DuVauchelle, 135 Hawai 'i 482, 490, 353 P.3d 1024, 1032 (2015). 
Elder filed his March 30, 2016 notice of appeal within thirty

days after entry of the March 10, 2016 post-judgment order as 
HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) requires for a timely appeal. Therefore, pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a), we have appellate jurisdiction over appellate court case number CAAP-16-0000266 to the limited extent that Elder seeks appellate review of the March 10, 2016 post-judgment order denying his January 14, 2016 post-judgment motion for HRCP Rule 60(b) relief from the December 17, 2015 amended judgment. Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Gundersons' July 13, 2016
 
motion to dismiss a portion (but not all) of Elder's appeal for
 lack of appellate jurisdiction is granted to the extent that
 Elder seeks appellate review of the December 17, 2015 amended
 judgment and preceding interlocutory orders. Elder's appeal
 shall proceed only to the extent that Elder seeks appellate
 review of the March 10, 2016 post-judgment order denying his
 January 14, 2016 post-judgment motion for HRCP Rule 60(b) relief.
 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that the Gundersons'
 
cross-appeal from the December 17, 2015 amended judgment (and
 preceding interlocutory orders) is dismissed in its entirety.
