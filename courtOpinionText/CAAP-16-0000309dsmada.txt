OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
DONALD B. MARKS, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
 
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY;
SHARI L. KIMOTO, Mainland/FDC Branch Administrator;
JOHN IOANE, Mainland/FDC Branch Contract Monitor; et al.,
Defendants-Appellees
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 14-1-1801)
 
ORDER
 
DISMISSING APPELLATE COURT CASE NUMBER CAAP-16-0000309
 
FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
AND
 
DISMISSING AS MOOT ALL PENDING MOTIONS
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the records in CAAP-16-0000309, it
 
appears this court lacks appellate jurisdiction. Plaintiff-
Appellant Donald B. Marks (Appellant), pro se, appeals from the
 "Order Denying Plaintiff's Motion for a Temporary Order and
 Preliminary Injunction (Filed November 4, 2015)," filed on March
 4, 2016 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit. 
HRS § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2015) authorizes appeals 
from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of 
Civil Procedure (HRCP) requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." HRCP Rule 58. Based on this NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
requirement under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai 'i has 
held that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders 
have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 
Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). "Thus, based on 
Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat
, 119 
Hawaii 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008). '
The Circuit Court has not yet entered a final judgment 
in the case. Therefore, absent a final judgment, the March 4, 2016 "Order Denying Plaintiff's Motion for a Temporary Order and Preliminary Injunction (Filed November 4, 2015)" is not yet appealable. Furthermore, the order is not independently appealable under (1) the collateral order doctrine, 
(2)
 the Forgay doctrine, or (3) HRS § 641-1(b) (1993 & Supp.
 
2015). Therefore, this court lacks appellate jurisdiction over
 the appeal.
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is dismissed for
 
lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions
 
in appellate court case number CAAP-16-0000309 are dismissed as
 moot.
