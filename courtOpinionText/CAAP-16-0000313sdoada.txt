JOSHUA JUAN WILHELM, also known as JOSHUA J. WILHELM,
Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(FC-CR. NO. 12-1-1234)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Joshua Juan Wilhelm, also known as
Joshua J. Wilhelm (Wilhelm) appeals from the Family Court of the
First Circuit's (Family Court)1 "Order Granting Execution of
Sentencing," "Order Denying [Wilhelm's] Oral Motion for Second
Stay of Execution of Sentencing Pending Appeal," and "Order
Denying [Wilhelm's] Motion for Reduction of Sentence" all entered
on March 4, 2016.  This is Wilhelm's second appeal from the
underlying case.
On February 8, 2013, Wilhelm was convicted of Abuse of
Household or Family Member under Hawai# i Revised Statutes (HRS)
§ 709-906 (Supp. 2012).2  He was sentenced to probation for a NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

of abuse of a family or household member, upon request, may
transport the abused person to a hospital or safe shelter.
For the purposes of this section, "family or household
member" means spouses or reciprocal beneficiaries, former
spouses or reciprocal beneficiaries, persons who have a
child in common, parents, children, persons related by
consanguinity, and persons jointly residing or formerly
residing in the same dwelling unit.
3HRS § 709-906(5) provides:
(5) Abuse of a family or household member and refusal
to comply with the lawful order of a police officer under
subsection (4) are misdemeanors and the person shall be
sentenced as follows:
(a) For the first offense the person shall serve a
minimum jail sentence of forty-eight hours; and
(b) For a second offense that occurs within one year
of the first conviction, the person shall be
termed a "repeat offender" and serve a minimum
jail sentence of thirty days.
Upon conviction and sentencing of the defendant, the court
shall order that the defendant immediately be incarcerated
to serve the mandatory minimum sentence imposed; provided
that the defendant may be admitted to bail pending appeal
pursuant to chapter 804.  The court may stay the imposition
of the sentence if special circumstances exist.

2term of two years and required to pay various fees.  He was also
sentenced to thirty days imprisonment under HRS § 709-906(5)(b)
(Supp. 2012), which requires a minimum of thirty days
imprisonment for repeat offenders.3  In CAAP-13-0000145,
Wilhelm's direct appeal, this court affirmed his conviction and
sentence on June 26, 2015.  On October 20, 2015, the Hawai# i
Supreme Court rejected Wilhelm's application for writ of
certiorari.  In that first appeal, one of Wilhelm's arguments was
that the sentencing scheme under HRS § 709-906(5)(b) was
unconstitutional, but he did not challenge it on Equal Protection
grounds.  In this appeal, Wilhelm contends that, in its orders
subsequent to the first appeal, the Family Court erred in
rejecting his argument that his right to Equal Protection under
the United States Constitution was violated where he was not
allowed, unlike those who are convicted under other mandatory
minimum provisions, to seek a reduction of the mandatory thirty-
day jail sentence upon showing strong mitigating factors.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
3After reviewing the record on appeal and the relevant
legal authorities, and giving due consideration to the issues and
arguments raised by the parties, we resolve Wilhelm's point as
follows and dismiss this appeal as moot.
"Courts may not decide moot questions or abstract
propositions of law."  Queen Emma Found. v. Tatibouet, 123
Hawai#i 500, 506, 236 P.3d 1236, 1242 (App. 2010) (citation and
internal quotation marks omitted).  Mootness is an issue of
subject matter jurisdiction, which is reviewed de novo .  Id. 
(citation omitted).  Consequently, if an appellant appeals his or
her sentence of imprisonment, but the sentence has already been
served, the appeal is generally considered moot.  State v. Kiese ,
126 Hawai #i 494, 508, 273 P.3d 1180, 1194 (2012) ("Appellate
courts generally do not decide moot questions.") (citation
omitted).  See, e.g. , Jardine v. State, 123 Hawai #i 313, 234 P.3d
695, No. 29907 2010 WL 2842739 at *1 (App. Jul. 21, 2010) (SDO)
(appeal challenging denial of final probation revocation hearing
was moot where the defendant already served the maximum term of
imprisonment).  Moreover, given the record and that Wilhelm's
conviction was affirmed in his first appeal, the exceptions to
the mootness doctrine do not apply.  See State v. Tierney, 127
Hawai#i 157, 172-73, 277 P.3d 251, 266-67 (2012); Kiese, 126
Hawai#i at 508-09, 273 P.3d at 1194-95.
Here, Wilhelm completed his mandatory jail term on
June 12, 2016 and he does not challenge any other aspect of his
sentence, his appeal from that aspect of his sentence is moot.
Therefore, Wilhelm's appeal is dismissed as moot.
