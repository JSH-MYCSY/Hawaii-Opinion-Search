(3) On June 6, 2016, the appellate clerk notified
 
Appellant that the time to docket the record on appeal expired on

 order authorizing Appellant to proceed on appeal in forma
 pauperis, the matter would be called to the court's attention on
 June 16, 2016, for action that may include dismissal, and
 Appellant may file a motion requesting relief from default;
 
(4) Appellant did not pay the filing fees, or take any
 
further action in this appeal; and
 
(5) An appeal may be dismissed where the record on 
appeal has not been prepared because the appellant failed to pay the required fees or obtain an order allowing the appellant to proceed in forma pauperis. Hawai
