SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Chan, JJ.) 
In this appeal arising out of a foreclosure action, 
Defendant-Appellant Association of Apartment Owners of Palm 
Villas II (the AOAO) appeals from the "Judgment Re: Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Confirmation of Sale, Directing Distribution of Proceeds, for Deficiency Judgment, Writ of Possession and Disposal of Personal Property Filed January 21, 2016" (Judgment) entered on March 21, 2016, by the Circuit Court      NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
of the First Circuit (circuit court).1 
The Judgment was entered on an order (Order) confirming 
the sale of foreclosed property on which Plaintiff-Appellee First 
Hawaiian Bank (FHB) had already obtained a prior judgment on a decree of foreclosure against the AOAO and Defendants-Appellees Kimberly J. L. Kaohi, the Ewa by Gentry Community Association, and Onemain Financial (HI), Inc. In the Order, the circuit court ruled that the amount of special assessment the AOAO was entitled to collect pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 514B-146 (2006 & Supp. 2017) was zero. 
I. 
On March 21, 2012, the AOAO filed a lien on a 
condominium unit located in Ewa Beach, Hawai# i (the Property) in 
the Office of the Assistant Registrar of the Land Court of the State of Hawai
#i (Land Court) pursuant to HRS § 514B-146 for 
unpaid assessments (Doc No. T-8116296). On October 29, 2013, the AOAO initiated nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings, by recording in the Land Court a notice of default and intention to foreclose (Doc. No. T-8702353). 
On July 11, 2014, the AOAO conducted a nonjudicial 
foreclosure auction under power of sale. As the highest bidder, the AOAO purchased the Property for an amount less than the delinquency. On July 21, 2014, the AOAO filed in the Land Court an affidavit of nonjudicial foreclosure under power of sale (Doc. No. T-8967211). 
On August 21, 2014, the AOAO recorded a 
quitclaim deed (Doc. No. T-8998241), conveying title to the Property to itself. The AOAO rented out the Property and collected the rental income. 
In May 2015, subsequent to the AOAO's nonjudicial 
foreclosure, FHB initiated judicial foreclosure proceedings pursuant to a mortgage executed by the former unit owner, Kimberly J. L. Kaohi. On June 25, 2015, FHB filed Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment as to All Claims and All Parties,

Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure and Order of Sale (MSJ). In 
its limited opposition to the MSJ, the AOAO argued that it should be allowed to remain in possession of the Property and continue renting it out until FHB's judicial foreclosure was completed or until the debt to the AOAO was paid in full. The AOAO also sought to assert and reserve its right to collect a six-month special assessment at the completion of FHB's judicial foreclosure. At the hearing on the MSJ on September 23, 2015, the circuit court granted the MSJ and reserved ruling on whether the AOAO was entitled to a special assessment for the hearing on the confirmation of the sale. The circuit court also allowed the AOAO to remain in possession of the Property and collect the rental proceeds but required the AOAO to provide an accounting of how the rental income was being applied prior to the confirmation hearing. 
On January 12, 2016, FHB conducted a public auction in 
its judicial foreclosure. The highest bidder was a third party named Marc Lonnstrom (the Purchaser). In a limited memorandum in opposition to FHB's motion to confirm the sale, the AOAO sought to collect six months of special assessments pursuant to HRS § 514B-146(g) and (h) (Supp. 2017). The circuit court ruled that the amount of the special assessment that the AOAO was entitled to collect was zero. 
II. 
On appeal, the AOAO contends that the circuit court 
erred in its interpretation of HRS § 514B-146 in reaching its conclusion that the amount of the special assessment that the AOAO was entitled to collect was zero. The AOAO asserts that, following completion of its nonjudicial foreclosure,
2 the 
Property was still delinquent and the AOAO's lien on the Property remained, and thus, the AOAO was entitled to recover special assessments from the Purchaser at the judicial foreclosure

proceedings.   See  Sakal  v.  Ass'n  of  Apartment  Owners  of  Hawaiian  Monarch,  143

herein.

auction, pursuant to HRS § 514B-146(g).  In support of its 
arguments, the AOAO interprets HRS § 514B-146(k) (Supp. 2017)  as 
providing that an association's statutory lien for unpaid 
assessments survives the association's foreclosure on the lien, and HRS § 667-103 (2016)  as providing that a property is still 
delinquent if the full amount of the delinquency is not recovered by the association upon its foreclosure. 543
In Am. Sav. Bank, F.S.B. v. Ass'n of Apartment Owners 
of the Hanohano Hale, No. CAAP-15-0000689, 2019 WL 968641 (Haw. App. Feb. 28, 2019) (Mem. Op.), we recently considered the same issues and rejected the same arguments. Consistent with our 
3 HRS § 514B-146(g) (Supp. 2017) provides, in relevant part: 
(g)  Subject  to  t his  subsection,  and  subsections  (h)  and  (i),
the  board  may  specially  assess  the  amount  of  the  unpaid
regular  monthly  common  assessments  for  common  expenses  against
a  mortgagee  or  other  purchaser  who,  in  a  judicial  or
nonjudicial  power  of  sale  foreclosure,  purchases  a  delinquent
unit[.] 
(Emp
hasis added). 
4 HRS § 514B-146(k) (Supp. 2017) provides, in relevant part: (k) After any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure proceeding
in which the association acquires title to the unit, any
excess rental income received by the association from the unitshall be paid to existing lien holders based on the priorityof lien, and not on a pro rata basis, and shall be applied tothe benefit of the unit owner. For purposes of thissubsection, excess rental income shall be any net incomereceived by the association after a court has issued a finaljudgment determining the priority of a senior mortgagee andafter paying, crediting, or reimbursing the association or athird party for: 
(1) The lien for delinquent assessments pursuant to
subsections (a) and (b); . . . provided that the lien for delinquent assessments under
paragraph (1) shall be paid, credited, or reimbursed first. 
5 HRS § 667-103 (2016) provides: 
Except as provided in section 667-92(f)(2), the recordation of
both the conveyance document and the affidavit shall notoperate as full satisfaction of the debt owed by the unitowner to the association unless the sale proceeds from theunit or the amounts paid by a purchaser under the specialassessment permitted by section 421J-10.5 or 514B-146 aresufficient to satisfy the unit owner's debt to theassociation[.] 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
decision in Hanohano, we conclude that the AOAO's nonjudicial 
foreclosure extinguished its lien for delinquent assessments and thus the Property was not delinquent for purposes of HRS § 514B-146(g) when the Purchaser purchased it via the judicial foreclosure. The AOAO therefore did not have the right to seek a special assessment from the Purchaser. 
III. 
Accordingly, we affirm the "Judgment Re: Order Granting 
Plaintiff's Motion for Confirmation of Sale, Directing Distribution of Proceeds, for Deficiency Judgment, Writ of Possession and Disposal of Personal Property Filed January 21, 2016" entered on March 21, 2016, by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit.
