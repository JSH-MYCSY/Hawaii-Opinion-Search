APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 15-1-0087)

 
ORDER
 
DISMISSING APPELLATE COURT CASE NUMBER
 
CAAP-16-0000325 FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
appellate jurisdiction over Third-Party Defendant/Cross-Claim 
Defendant/Third-Party Counterclaim-Plaintiff/Appellant Stacy Moniz ("Appellant Stacy Moniz"), and Third-Party Defendants/ Cross-Claim Defendants/Appellants Jo Anne N. Moniz, Antonia L. Moniz, and John Moniz's ("the Other Moniz Appellants") appeal from the Honorable Kathleen N.A. Watanabe's April 4, 2016 judgment as to one or more but fewer than all claims or parties pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP), because the April 4, 2016 HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified judgment does not satisfy the specificity requirements for an appealable final judgment under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2015), HRCP Rule 54(b), HRCP Rule 58 and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals from final judgments, 
orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRCP Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth 
on a separate document." "An appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 119, 869 
P.2d at 1338. Furthermore, 
if a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a case
involving multiple claims or multiple parties, the judgment
(a) must specifically identify the party or parties for and
against whom the judgment is entered, and (b) must (i)
identify the claims for which it is entered, and
(ii) dismiss any claims not specifically identified[.]
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (emphases added). 
For example: "Pursuant to the jury verdict entered on
(date), judgment in the amount of $___ is hereby entered in
favor of Plaintiff X and against Defendant Y upon counts I
through IV of the complaint." . . . . If the circuit court
 intends that claims other than those listed in the judgment
language should be dismissed, it must say so: for example,
"Defendant Y's counterclaim is dismissed," or "Judgment upon
Defendant Y's counterclaim is entered in favor of
 Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all other claims,
counterclaims, and cross-claims are dismissed."
 
Id. at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4 (emphasis added). 
The April 4, 2016 HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified judgment 
enters a judgment for declaratory relief as to an easement 
through real property in favor of Defendants/Counterclaim­Plaintiffs/Third-Party Plaintiffs/Cross-Claim Defendants/Third-Party Counterclaim-Defendants/Appellees Sandy Poehnelt ("Appellee Poehnelt"), Pua
'a 'Ili 'Oi 'Oi Ohana, LLC ("Appellee Pua 'a 'Ili 'Oi 
'Oi Ohana"), and The Right Slice, LLC ("Appellee The Right 
Slice"), and Third-Party Defendant/Cross-Claim Plaintiff/Third-Party Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellee Mary C. Walsh (Appellee Walsh) and against Appellant Stacy Moniz and the Other Moniz Appellants. Although multiple parties in this case have asserted multiple claims (including multiple separate claims for 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
declaratory relief regarding an easement through real property)
 
by way of
 
1.	 Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/Third-Party
Plaintiff/Third-Party Counterclaim-Defendant/AppelleeCommercial Properties, Limited's (Appellee CommercialProperties), June 22, 2015 complaint that asserted threeenumerated counts against Appellees Poehnelt, Pua' a 'Ili 'Oi 
'Oi Ohana, and The Right Slice, 
2.	 Appellees Poehnelt, Pua' a 'Ili 'Oi 'Oi Ohana, and The Right
Slice's July 14, 2015 counterclaim that asserted fourenumerated counts against Appellee Commercial Properties, 
3.	 Appellees Poehnelt, Pua' a 'Ili 'Oi 'Oi Ohana, and The Right
Slice's July 14, 2015 third-party complaint that assertedtwo enumerated counts against Appellant Stacy Moniz and theOther Moniz Appellants, 
4.	 Appellee Commercial Properties' August 13, 2015 third-party
complaint that asserted a single count against Appellant
Stacy Moniz, the Other Moniz Appellants and Appellee Walsh,
 
5.	 Appellee Walsh's October 23, 2015 cross-claim that asserteda single count against Appellee Poehnelt, Appellee Pua' a 'Ili 
'Oi 'Oi Ohana, Appellee The Right Slice, Appellant Stacy
Moniz and the Other Moniz Appellants, 
6.	 Appellant Stacy Moniz's February 23, 2016 third-party
counterclaim that asserted six enumerated counts against
Appellee Walsh,
 
7.	 Appellant Stacy Moniz's February 23, 2016 third-party
counterclaim that asserted eight enumerated counts against
Appellee Commercial Properties, and
 
8.	 
Appellant Stacy Moniz's March 7, 2016 third-partycounterclaim that asserted nine enumerated counts againstAppellees Poehnelt, Pua
'a 'Ili 'Oi 'Oi Ohana, and The Right
Slice, 
the April 4, 2016 HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified judgment does not
 
specifically identify the claim or claims on which the circuit
 court intends to enter judgment. Without specifically
 identifying the claim or claims on which the circuit court
 intends to enter judgment, the April 4, 2016 HRCP Rule 54(b)­certified judgment does not satisfy the specificity requirements
 for an appealable final judgment in a multiple-claim case under
 HRS § 641-1(a), HRCP Rule 54(b), HRCP Rule 58 and the holding in
 Jenkins, even though the circuit court certified this judgment as
 
-4­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
to one or more but fewer than all claims or parties pursuant to 
HRCP Rule 54(b). The Supreme Court of Hawai 'i has explained that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality, . . . and we should not make such searches
necessary by allowing the parties the option of waiving the
requirements of HRCP [Rule] 58.
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (citation omitted; 
original emphasis). Absent an appealable final judgment that 
specifically identifies the claim or claims on which the circuit court intends to enter judgment, we lack appellate jurisdiction, and this appeal is premature. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
 
case number CAAP-16-0000325 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
