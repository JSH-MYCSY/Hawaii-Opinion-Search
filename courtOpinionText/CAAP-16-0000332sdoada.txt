STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent-Appellee
 
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
 
(S.P.P. NO. 14-1-0014; CR. NO. 88-2289)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, and Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Rhonda`e Quin`ley appeals from the
 
Order Dismissing Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct
 
Judgment or to Release Petitioner from Custody, filed on
 February 29, 2016, in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
 ("Circuit Court").

On November 6, 1995, after pleading guilty, Quin`ley 
was convicted of Assault in the First Degree, Kidnapping, and Sexual Assault in the Third Degree. On February 25, 2009, Quin`ley filed a Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner from Custody in accordance with Rule 40 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Penal Procedure ("HRPP") which 
was docketed as SPP No. 09-1-0011 ("First Petition"). Quin`ley claimed, among other things, that his plea agreement was violated when his presentence credit was recalculated pursuant to State v. Tauiliili, 96 Hawai
'i 195, 29 P.3d 914 (2001). On June 30, 2010, 
the Circuit Court issued its Amended Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying Petition for PostÂ­

Conviction Relief Without a Hearing, which denied the First
 Petition. Quin`ley did not appeal from the denial of his First
 Petition.
 
On September 30, 2010, Quin`ley filed a Petition to
 
Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner
 from Custody in accordance with HRPP Rule 40 which was docketed
 as SPP No. 10-1-0073 ("Second Petition"). Quin`ley again claimed
 that his plea agreement was violated when his presentence credit
 was recalculated pursuant to Tauiliili. Quin`ley also contended
 that the plea agreement was unlawfully induced and made
 unknowingly, and that he had received ineffective assistance of
 counsel. On May 3, 2011, the Circuit Court issued its Findings
 of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying Petition for Post-
Conviction Relief Without a Hearing, which denied the Second
 Petition. Quin`ley did not appeal from the denial of his Second
 Petition.
 
On June 2, 2014, Quin`ley filed a Petition to Vacate,
 
 
Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner from
 
 
Custody in accordance with HRPP Rule 40 which was docketed as
 
 
S.P.P. No. 14-1-0014 ("Third Petition"). Quin`ley claimed that
 
 
his guilty plea was obtained without real understanding of the
 
 
consequences of the plea, i.e. the application of presentence
 
 
credit should have been applied to each conviction, and that he
 
 
was provided ineffective assistance of counsel when his counsel
 
 
"misled" and "illadvised" him about the plea agreement regarding
 
 
the application of presentence credit. On February 29, 2016 the
 
 
Circuit Court issued its Order Dismissing Petition to Vacate, Set
 
 
Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner from Custody,
 
 
which dismissed the Third Petition.
 
 
On appeal, Quin`ley contends that his presentence
 
credit was improperly denied for each conviction because
 Tauiliili should not apply to him retroactively. Upon careful
 review of the record and the briefs submitted by the parties and
 having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the
 issues raised by the parties, we resolve Quin`ley's point of
 error as follows and affirm.

Quin`ley raises the same issue on appeal as he did in
 
the First and Second Petitions. We conclude that the claims
 raised by Quin`ley in his Third Petition for post-conviction
 relief have been previously ruled upon or have been waived. See
 
Haw. R. Penal P. 40(a)(3) (stating that relief under Rule 40
 "shall not be granted where the issues sought to be raised have
 been previously ruled upon or were waived"). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Order
 
Dismissing Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or
 to Release Petitioner from Custody, filed on February 29, 2016,
 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.
