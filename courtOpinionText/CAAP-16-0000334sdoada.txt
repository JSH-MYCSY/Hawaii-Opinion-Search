case. Based on Reyes-Toledo, we vacate the Foreclosure Judgment
 
and remand for further proceedings.
 
I.
 
Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC (Ocwen) filed a complaint
 
against Busto seeking to foreclose on Busto's property due to her
 alleged breach of a promissory note and mortgage originally
 executed in favor of IndyMac Bank, F.S.B. (IndyMac).
3/ Busto
 
filed an answer, asserting, among other things, that Ocwen lacked
 standing.
 
Ocwen filed a motion for summary judgment. Busto
 
opposed Ocwen's motion on a number of grounds which included lack
 of standing. In support of its motion, Ocwen submitted the
 Declaration of Vanessa Lewis (Lewis), a Contract Management
 Coordinator for Ocwen, who declared that Ocwen "is in possession
 of" the original promissory note executed by Busto, and that a
 "true and correct copy" of the promissory note was attached to
 Lewis' Declaration. The promissory note attached to Lewis'
 Declaration was indorsed in blank by IndyMac. Lewis'
 Declaration, however, did not state when Ocwen obtained
 possession of the promissory note indorsed in blank and did not
 assert that Ocwen possessed the promissory note indorsed in blank
 at the time it filed its complaint.
 
After Ocwen filed its summary judgment motion, it
 
transferred the subject promissory note and assigned the subject
 mortgage to U.S. Bank Trust, N.A. as Trustee for LSF9 Master
 Participation Trust (U.S. Bank). Based on this transfer and
 assignment, Ocwen moved to substitute U.S. Bank as Plaintiff on
 the grounds the U.S. Bank had become the holder of the subject
 promissory note and mortgage. The Circuit Court granted the
 substitution motion.
 
On March 21, 2016, the Circuit Court granted
 
Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and issued its
 Foreclosure Judgment.
 
3/ The complaint also named the Association of Apartment Owners of
Ko'olani, Inc. as a defendant.

II.
 
On appeal, Busto argues that the Circuit Court erred in 
granting Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. Based on the 
Hawai'i Supreme Court's recent decision in Reyes-Toledo, we 
conclude that the Circuit Court erred in granting the motion for summary judgment. 
In Reyes-Toledo, the supreme court held that in order 
to establish its right to foreclose, the foreclosing plaintiff, Bank of America, was required to establish its entitlement to enforce the subject promissory note at the time the foreclosure proceedings were commenced. Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai
'i at 367-70, 
390 P.3d at 1254-57. The supreme court held that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Bank of America because Bank of America failed to establish that it was entitled to enforce the subject promissory note at the time it filed the foreclosure complaint. Id. at 370-71, 390 P.3d at 1257-58. In 
concluding that Bank of American failed to satisfy its burden as the movant for summary judgment, the supreme court reasoned: "Although Bank of America produced evidence that it possessed the blank-indorsed Note at the time it sought summary judgment, a material question of fact exists as to whether Bank of America possessed the Note, or was otherwise a holder, at the time it brought the foreclosure action." Id. at 370, 390 P.3d at 1257. 
In other words, Bank of America's showing that it possessed the bank-indorsed note, and thus was entitled to enforce the note as the holder of the note, at the time it sought summary judgment was insufficient because Bank of America failed to additionally show that it possessed the blank-indorsed note, or was otherwise entitled to enforce the note, at the time it filed the foreclosure complaint. Id. at 370-71, 390 P.3d at 1257-58. 
Similarly, in this case, while Ocwen produced evidence
 
that it possessed the subject promissory note at the time it
 sought summary judgment, it failed to establish that it possessed
 the blank-indorsed note, or was otherwise the holder of the note,
 at the time it filed its foreclosure complaint. We conclude that
 Reyes-Toledo controls our decision in this case. Based on ReyesÂ­

Toledo, we conclude that there was a genuine issue of material
 
fact as to whether Ocwen was entitled to foreclose when it filed
 its foreclosure complaint. Therefore, the Circuit Court erred in
 granting the motion for summary judgment. 
III.
 
Based on the foregoing, we vacate the Foreclosure
 
Judgment, and we remand the case for further proceedings
 consistent with this Summary Disposition Order.
