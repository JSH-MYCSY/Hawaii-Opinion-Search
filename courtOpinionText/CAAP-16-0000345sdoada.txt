ONOLULU DIVISION 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-15-03477) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Maxwell F. Jones (Jones) appeals 
from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/ 
Judgment (
Judgment) entered by the District Court of the First 
Circuit, Honolulu Division (District Court)  on March 22, 2016. 
Jones was convicted of Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of 
an Intoxicant (OVUII) in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes 
(HRS) ยง 291E-61(a)(1) (Supp. 2014).   Jones contends that the 
District Court erred by: 21

(a) A person commits the offense of operating a
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if the person
operates or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle:

1. admitting a police officer's testimony about 
Jones's performance on the standardized field sobriety test 
(SFST) and the officer's opinion that Jones failed the SFST; 
2. admitting a police officer's testimony about his 
administration of the horizontal gaze nystagmus3 (HGN) test "for 
the purpose of determining substantive evidence of intoxication beyond simple probable cause"; 
3. taking judicial notice of a certified traffic 
abstract and admitting it into evidence; and 
4. finding Jones guilty of OVUII based upon 
insufficient evidence. 
For the reasons explained below, we affirm the 
Judgment. 
I. 
The parties agree that at about 3:15 a.m. on July 25, 
2015, Honolulu Police Department (HPD) officer Joshua Wong 
stopped a motor vehicle driven by Jones after Officer Wong saw 
the vehicle run a red light.  Jones was charged by complaint with OVUII.  He pleaded not guilty. 
Trial was held on January 8, 2016 and March 22, 2016. 
Officer Wong testified that he was driving a marked HPD vehicle 
3 Nystagmus is: 
a well-known physiological phenomenon that has been defined
by one medical dictionary as "an involuntary rapid movementof the eyeball, which may be horizontal, vertical, rotatory,or mixed, i.e., of two varieties."  HGN or jerk nystagmus isa particular type of nystagmus "characterized by a slowdrift, usually away from the direction of gaze, followed bya quick jerk or recovery in the direction of gaze."  Stated otherwise, it "is the inability of the eyes to maintainvisual fixation as they are turned from side to side." 
. . . . [I]t has been well-documented through research studies over the
years that alcohol intoxication affects eye movement and nystagmusbecomes more pronounced with alcohol consumption.

mauka4 on Ke# eaumoku Street.  He stopped for a red light at the 
Makaloa Street intersection.  The light turned green for traffic 
on Ke
#eaumoku Street.  Before Officer Wong entered the 
intersection he heard an engine roaring.  He looked to his left. He saw headlights from a vehicle on Makaloa Street approaching the Ke# eaumoku Street intersection.  The vehicle went through the 
intersection against the red light.  Officer Wong turned onto Makaloa Street, activated his blue light and siren, and stopped the vehicle.  Jones was sitting in the driver's seat. 
Officer Wong told Jones he ran a red light.  Jones 
stated, "oh, I didn't make the light?"  Officer Wong smelled a "strong odor of alcohol coming from [Jones's] breath."  Jones's eyes were red and bloodshot, and Jones's speech was slurred. Officer Wong asked Jones for his motor vehicle registration, insurance card and driver's license.  Jones fumbled with his license and it fell in his lap.  Officer Wong asked Jones if he would participate in the SFST, and Jones agreed.  
At the time of the trial Officer Wong had been a police 
officer for five years.  He had been trained to administer, and had administered, the SFST "close to a thousand" times.  He had made 600 to 700 arrests for driving under the influence of intoxicants.  In February 2015 he became an SFST instructor for HPD.  In order to become certified as an instructor he was taught by National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and 
International Association of Chiefs of Police (
IACP) qualified 
instructors. 
He asked Jones the medical rule-out questions, to which 
Jones answered "no[.]"  He described the procedures for 
performing, and criteria for evaluating, the HGN test, consistent with Ito, 90 
Hawai# i at 230-33, 978 P.2d at 196-99.  Jones did 
not have resting nystagmus, his pupils were equal in size, and he was able to track a stimulus equally with each eye.  During the HGN test Jones showed a lack of smooth pursuit of the stimulus in

both eyes.  He displayed nystagmus in each eye at maximum 
deviation.  He displayed nystagmus in each eye prior to 45-degree lateral movement.  Officer Wong testified that Jones failed the HGN test. 
Officer Wong described the procedures for performing, 
and criteria for evaluating, the walk-and-turn test.  Jones was unable to keep his balance during the instructional phase.  He took ten steps in each direction instead of nine.  He made an improper turn.  He missed heel-to-toe on five steps.  He stepped off the line three times.  He raised his arms instead of keeping them at his side as he had been instructed.  Officer Wong testified that Jones failed the walk-and-turn test. 
Officer Wong also described the procedures for 
performing, and criteria for evaluating, the one-leg stand test. Jones swayed and raised his arms three times during the one-leg stand test.  Officer Wong testified that Jones failed the one-leg stand test. 
Officer Wong testified: 
Q. So taking this defendant's performance on the
SFST as a whole, what was your evaluation of the defendant's
performance on July 25th, 2015? 
A. My evaluation is that based on all three of the
standardized field sobriety tests that the defendant was notsober and that he was not able to operate a vehiclesafely[.] 
The District Court found Jones guilty as charged and entered the 
Judgment.  This appeal followed. 
II. 
A. 
Jones's first point of error argues that the District 
Court erred in admitting Officer Wong's testimony about Jones's performance on the SFST and Officer Wong's opinion that Jones failed the SFST.
5 
5 As discussed below, even if the District Court erroneously allowed
Officer Wong to opine that Jones failed the SFST, the error was harmless
(continued...) 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The SFST consists of three parts: (1) HGN; (2) walk-
and-turn; and (3) one-leg stand.  The evidence showed that 
Officer Wong was certified by NHTSA and IACP to instruct HPD officers to perform and evaluate the SFST.  See State v. Bebb, 99 Hawai# i 213, 216 n.3, 53 P.3d 1198, 1201 n.3 (App. 2001) 
(referring to "Officers trained in the NHTSA/IACP-approved SFST . . . curricula"), overruled on other grounds by State v.Maldonado, 108 Hawai# i 436, 445 n.13, 121 P.3d 901, 910 n.13 
(2005).  Officer Wong was qualified to conduct and grade the science-based HGN test, and performed the test properly upon Jones.  See Ito, 90 Hawai
#i at 244, 978 P.2d at 210.  Officer 
Wong was also qualified to conduct and grade the walk-and-turn and one-leg stand performance tests he administered to Jones. The District Court found him to be qualified to express opinions under the standard set forth in State v. Mitchell, 94 Hawai# i 
388, 396-97, 15 P.3d 314, 322-23 (App. 2000).  Accordingly, it was not error for the District Court to allow Officer Wong to express an expert opinion  that Jones "failed" the HGN test, the 
walk-and-turn test, and the one-leg stand test.

B. 
Jones next contends that the District Court erred in 
admitting Officer Wong's testimony about Jones's performance on 
5(...continued)
because there was other substantial evidence supporting Jones's OVUII
conviction. 
6 Hawaii Rules of Evidence ( HRE) Rule 702 (1993) ("Testimony by 
experts") provides, in pertinent part: 
If scientific, technical, or other specialized
knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand theevidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witnessqualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience,training, or education may testify thereto in the form of anopinion or otherwise. 
7 Although Officer Wong also opined that Jones's performance on the
SFST indicated that Jones's "blood alcohol content is at or above a .08[,]"Jones was not convicted of violating HRS ยง 291E-61(a)(4) (Supp. 2014)(operation of a vehicle with ".08 or more grams of alcohol per one hundredmilliliters or cubic centimeters of blood").

the HGN test and other SFSTs "for the purpose of determining 
substantive evidence of intoxication beyond simple probable cause[,]" citing State v. Toyomura, 80 Hawai# i 8, 904 P.2d 893 
(1995) and Bebb, supra. 
In Toyomura, the Hawai# i Supreme Court adopted and 
approved our analysis in State v. Nishi, 9 Haw. App. 516, 521-24, 852 P.2d 476, 479-80 (1993) that foundational evidence of a police officer's knowledge of HPD's SFST procedure was necessary before the officer could be allowed to express an expert opinion about whether a defendant was intoxicated based upon an SFST. Toyomura, 80 Hawai
#i at 26, 904 P.2d at 911.  In this case the 
State laid a proper foundation for Officer Wong, an NHTSA- and IACP-certified SFST instructor for HPD, to opine that Jones was intoxicated based upon the results of Jones's SFST. 
In Bebb, HPD officer Brian Rego administered the SFST 
to Bebb after Bebb was stopped for running a red light.  In that case, "we [were] not presented with the question of whether Officer Rego was qualified as an expert.  We [were] presented with the question of whether the [trial] court was permitted to consider Officer Rego's lay opinion[ ] of [Bebb]'s intoxication." 
99 Hawai# i at 217, 53 P.3d at 1202 (emphasis and footnote added). 
In this case, because we hold that Officer Wong was properly allowed to express an expert opinion that Jones was intoxicated, Bebb does not apply.

C. 
Jones's third point of error challenges the District 
Court's taking judicial notice of Jones's traffic abstract, 
8 HRE Rule 701 (1993) ("Opinion testimony by lay witnesses") 
provides: 
If the witness is not testifying as an expert, the
witness' testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is
limited to those opinions or inferences which are (1)rationally based on the perception of the witness, and (2)helpful to a clear understanding of the witness' testimonyor the determination of a fact in issue.

State's trial Exhibit 3 (Abstract).  The State offered the 
Abstract โ which shows that Jones was convicted for OVUII on 
December 24, 2013 โ in connection with the charge for violation of HRS ยง 291E-61(b)(2) (Supp. 2014) ("offense that occurs within five years of a prior conviction for [OVUII]"). 
"Under HRE Rule 201(d), a court shall take judicial 
notice when a party requests that the court take judicial notice of a fact and supplies the court with the necessary information." State v. Abdon, 137 Hawai# i 19, 27, 364 P.3d 917, 925 (2016). 
The Abstract was a certified copy of information about Jones's other traffic violations, including a judgment of conviction for OVUII entered on December 24, 2013, "extracted from the official records of the District Courts of the State of Hawaii [Hawai# i]" 
and signed by the Clerk of the District Court of the First Circuit, State of Hawai# i
.  "The most frequent use of judicial 
notice of ascertainable facts is in noticing the content of court records."  Id. at 26, 364 P.3d at 924 (citation omitted).  The District Court did not err in taking, and was in fact required to take, judicial notice of the Abstract pursuant to HRE Rule 201(d) (1993). 
Jones's opening brief argues that the Abstract was 
testimonial hearsay that should have been excluded under the confrontation clause of article I, section 14 of the Hawai# i 
Constitution,  citing State v. Fields, 115 
9Hawai# i 503, 168 P.3d 
955 (2007).  Fields concerned an out-of-court statement made by an assault victim to a police officer.  More recently, in State v. Fitzwater, 122 Hawai# i 354, 227 P.3d 520 (2010), the Hawai# i 
Supreme Court held that the defendant's right to confrontation was not violated by the admission of a speed check card created in a non-adversarial setting in the regular course of maintaining 
9 The confrontation clause of article I, section 14 of the Hawai #i 
Constitution states: "In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy
the right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses against the accused[.]"

a police vehicle.  The Abstract at issue in this case was 
prepared and certified by the District Court's clerk in the regular course of the court's business; it was not prepared or certified in the course of HPD's investigation of the OVUII charge against Jones.  It is akin to the speed check card at issue in Fitzwater, id. at 370-74, 227 P.3d at 536-40, and the intoxilyzer log at issue in State v. Ofa, 9 Haw. App. 130, 135-39, 828 P.2d 813, 816-18 (1992).  We hold that Jones's right to confrontation under the Hawai# i Constitution was not violated by 
the admission of the Abstract. 
Moreover, even if the Abstract had been admitted in 
error, the error would have been harmless because State's Exhibit 2 โ a certified copy of the December 24, 2013 OVUII judgment โ establishes that the defendant in this case is the same person convicted in 2013 by referring to Jones's JIMS ID @1298478.  Jones does not appeal from the District Court's admission of State's Exhibit 2. 
D. 
Jones's final point of error argues that the evidence 
was insufficient to support a conviction for OVUII.  We disagree. Even without Officer Wong's opinions that Jones "failed" the HGN test, the walk-and-turn test, and the one-leg stand test, there was substantial evidence supporting Jones's OVUII conviction. 
When reviewing the sufficiency of evidence on appeal, 
we apply the following deferential standard of review: 
[E]vidence adduced in the trial court must be considered in
the strongest light for the prosecution when the appellatecourt passes on the legal sufficiency of such evidence tosupport a conviction; the same standard applies whether thecase was before a judge or jury.  The test on appeal is notwhether guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt, butwhether there was substantial evidence to support theconclusion of the trier of fact. 
State v. Kalaola, 124 Hawai# i 43, 49, 237 P.3d 1109, 1115 (2010) 
(citations omitted).  "'Substantial evidence' . . . is credible 
evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
enable a person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion." 
Id. (citation omitted). 
Matters relating to the credibility of witnesses and the
weight to be given to the evidence are generally left to thefactfinder.  The appellate court will neither reconcileconflicting evidence nor interfere with the decision of thetrier of fact based on the witnesses' credibility or theweight of the evidence. 
Mitchell at 393, 15 P.3d at 319 (citations omitted). 
A police officer can express a "lay" opinion that an 
arrestee is not sober based on the officer's "lay" observations. 
Toyomura, 80 Hawai# i at 26-27, 904 P.2d at 911-12.  A police 
officer's "lay" opinion that an arrestee is not sober cannot be based on the officer's "assessment of the results of the FSTs." Id. at 26, 904 P.2d at 911 (emphasis added).  However, "the psychomotor FSTs [walk-and-turn and one-leg stand] are non-scientific in nature."  State v. Ferrer, 95 Hawai
#i 409, 427, 23 
P.3d 744, 762 (App. 2001).  "[I]t is permissible for a police officer to testify as a lay witness about his or her observations of a defendant's performance on various FSTs and to give an opinion, based on such observations, that the defendant was intoxicated."  Id. at 429, 23 P.3d at 764 (emphasis added). 
Officer Wong testified that Jones was unable to keep 
his balance during the instructional phase of the walk-and-turn test, took ten steps in each direction instead of nine as instructed, made an improper turn, missed heel-to-toe on five steps, stepped off the line three times, and raised his arms instead of keeping them at his side as he had been instructed. Officer Wong also testified that Jones swayed and raised his arms three times during the one-leg stand test.  Officer Wong's testimony about his observations of Jones's performance on the walk-and-turn and one-leg stand tests, along with Officer Wong's observations of Jones's operation of his car, the strong odor of alcohol coming from Jones's breath, Jones's red and bloodshot eyes, Jones's fumbling with his driver's license, and Jones's dropping his license in his lap, was sufficient to support Jones' conviction.
