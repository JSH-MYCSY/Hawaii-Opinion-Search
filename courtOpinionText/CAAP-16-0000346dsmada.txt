papers in support, and the record, it appears that (1) the appeal 
has not been docketed; (2) pursuant to Hawai 'i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 42(b), the parties stipulate to dismiss the appeal with prejudice, and bear their own costs and attorneys' fees on appeal; (3) the stipulation is dated and signed by counsel for all represented parties, and by all parties appearing in the appeal pro se; and (4) because the appeal has not been docketed, dismissal is authorized by HRAP Rule 42(a), rather than HRAP Rule 42(b). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the stipulation to
 
dismiss the appeal is approved and the appeal is dismissed with
 prejudice. The parties shall bear their own costs and attorneys'
 fees on appeal.
