REGINALD BOTELHO, Claimant-Appellant,
v.
ATLAS RECYCLING CENTER, LLC and HAWAI#I EMPLOYERS' MUTUAL
INSURANCE COMPANY, Employer/Insurance Carrier/Appellees
and
SPECIAL COMPENSATION FUND, Appellee
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
(Case No. AB 2009-334(H)(S)(DCD No. 1-06-00818))
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.)
Claimant-Appellant Reginald Botelho (Botelho ) appeals
from one of two attorney's fee approval orders entered by the
Department of Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board
(Appeals Board ) on April 20, 2016.  Botelho claims that the
Appeals Board improperly reduced his attorney's hourly billing
rate from $325 to $165.  For the reasons explained below, we
affirm the Order.
I.
Botelho was injured on May 10, 2005, while working for
Employer-Appellee Atlas Recycling Center LLC (Atlas).  He filed a
claim for workers' compensation benefits.  Atlas did not pay
benefits to Botelho.  On January 30, 2007, the Department of
Labor and Industrial Relations Disability Compensation Division
(DCD) found that Botelho was injured because of an accident
arising out of and in the course of his employment by Atlas.  TheNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
DCD ordered that Atlas and Insurance Carrier-Appellee Hawaii
Employers' Mutual Insurance Company (collectively, Employer) pay
workers' compensation benefits to Botelho.
Employer still did not pay workers' compensation
benefits to Botelho.  On May 15, 2009, the DCD assessed
attorney's fees and costs against Employer pursuant to Hawaii
Revised Statutes (HRS ) § 386-93(a) (1993).   On May 22, 2009,
Botelho's attorney Stanford H. Masui (Masui ) requested DCD
approval of his fees based on an hourly rate of $155.  The DCD
approved Masui's fees based upon the $155 hourly rate.1
Meanwhile, on June 3, 2009, Employer appealed the DCD's
May 15, 2009 decision to the Appeals Board.  Employer moved for
partial summary judgment, arguing that HRS § 386-93(a) did not
authorize an award of attorneys fees.  On November 16, 2009, the
Appeals Board concluded that HRS § 386-93(a) "does not authorize
the assessment of attorney's fees in addition to costs[,]" citing
our summary disposition order in Kelly v. Metal-Weld Specialties,
Inc., Nos. 27127 and 27208, 2008 WL 4409419 (Haw. App. Sept. 30,
2008) (SDO).  Botelho filed a notice of appeal on December 7,
2009.
On February 28, 2013, we issued a memorandum opinion in
Botelho v. Atlas Recycling Centers, LLC, No. 30226, 2013 WL
764878 (Haw. App. Feb. 28, 2013) (mem.).  We held that Kelly had
been incorrectly decided based upon two decisions by the
territorial supreme court construing predecessor statutes to HRS
§ 386-93(a) that had not been cited to us by the parties in
Kelly.  We also noted that in 2012 the legislature amended HRS §
386-93(a) to specifically authorize the assessment of "reasonable
attorney's fees."  Accordingly, we vacated the Appeals Board's

provided:
§ 386-93 Costs.  (a) If the director of labor and
industrial relations, appellate board or any court finds
that proceedings under this chapter have been brought,
prosecuted, or defended without reasonable ground the whole
costs of the proceedings may be assessed against the party
who has so brought, prosecuted, or defended the proceedings.

November 16, 2009 decision and remanded the case for further
proceedings.
On April 25, 2013, Masui filed an untimely motion for
attorney's fees and costs with us.  We chose to consider the
motion, see Tortorello v. Tortorello, 113 Hawai# i 432, 442, 153
P.3d 1117, 1127 (2007) (holding that appellate courts have
discretion to consider untimely motion for costs), and denied the
motion "without prejudice to Botelho seeking his appellate
attorney's fees before the LIRAB on remand, should Employer lose
its appeal of the Director's decision to the LIRAB."
On remand, by letter dated May 7, 2013, Masui asked
that the Appeals Board approve his attorney's fees based on an
hourly rate of $160.  The parties stipulated to submit Botelho's
appeal to the Appeals Board on the briefs.  On November 9, 2015,
the Appeals Board issued a decision that concluded, among other
things, that Atlas is liable for Botelho's attorney's fees
pursuant to HRS § 386-93(a) as an administrative penalty.  On
November 17, 2015, the Appeals Board issued an order approving
Masui's fees based on an hourly rate of $160.
By letter dated November 18, 2015, Masui submitted the
request for approval of attorney's fees at issue in this appeal.
Masui requested that the Appeals Board approve his fees based on
an hourly rate of $325 for "[a]ppellate work before the ICA" and
$160 for work done after the remand to the Appeals Board. 
Employer objected to Masui's $325 hourly rate and to the amount
of time Masui spent working on the case at both levels.  The
Appeals Board entered an order on December 23, 2015, approving
the hourly rate of $160 for work involving the Appeals Board. 
The order did not mention the $325 hourly rate or any work done
on the secondary appeal.
On April 20, 2016, the Appeals Board issued two orders
on Masui's requests for attorney's fees.  The first order is not
at issue in this appeal.  The second order ( Order) is at issue in
this appeal.  The Appeals Board did not approve Masui's requested
hourly rate of $325 for work on Botelho's secondary appeal; it
reduced Masui's hourly billing rate to $165.  The Appeals Board
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
also reduced or disallowed certain amounts of time Masui claimed
for various tasks, but those decisions are not at issue in this
appeal.
II.
The standards set forth in HRS § 91-14(g) (1993) apply
to our review of the Appeals Board's decision.  McLaren v.
Paradise Inn Hawaii LLC, 132 Hawai#i 320, 328, 321 P.3d 671, 679
(2014).  HRS § 91-14, entitled "Judicial review of contested
cases," provides in relevant part:
(g)Upon review of the record the court may affirm
the decision of the agency or remand the case with
instructions for further proceedings; or it may reverse or
modify the decision and order if the substantial rights of
the petitioners may have been prejudiced because the
administrative findings, conclusions, decisions, or orders
are:
(1)In violation of constitutional or statutory
provisions; or
(2)In excess of the statutory authority or
jurisdiction of the agency; or
(3)Made upon unlawful procedure; or
(4)Affected by other error of law; or
(5)Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,
probative, and substantial evidence on the whole
record; or
(6)Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized by
abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted
exercise of discretion.
"Under HRS § 91–14(g), conclusions of law are reviewable under
subsections (1), (2), and (4); questions regarding procedural
defects are reviewable under subsection (3); findings of fact are
reviewable under subsection (5); and an agency's exercise of
discretion is reviewable under subsection (6)."  McLaren, 132
Hawai#i at 328, 321 P.3d at 679 (citation omitted).
III.
The only issue presented by Botelho's appeal is whether
the Appeals Board improperly reduced Masui's hourly billing rate
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
for working on the secondary appeal from $325 to $165.  The
request for attorney's fees at issue in this case was made
pursuant to HRS § 386-93(b) (2015 repl.), which provides in
relevant part:
If an employer appeals a decision of the . . . appellate
board, the costs of the proceedings of the . . . appellate
court, together with reasonable attorney's fees, shall be
assessed against the employer if the employer loses[.]
HRS § 386-94 (2015 repl.) governs the Appeals Board's awarding of
attorneys' fees.  That statute provides, in relevant part:
In approving fee requests, the . . . appeals board . . . may
consider factors such as the attorney's skill and experience
in state workers' compensation matters, the amount of time
and effort required by the complexity of the case, the
novelty and difficulty of issues involved, the amount of
fees awarded in similar cases, benefits obtained for the
claimant, and the hourly rate customarily awarded attorneys
possessing similar skills and experience.  In all cases,
reasonable attorney's fees shall be awarded.
See McLaren, 132 Hawai# i at 322 n.1, 321 P.3d at 673 n.1.  The
Appeals Board's award of attorney's fees is reviewed under the
abuse of discretion standard.  Id. at 331–32, 321 P.3d at 682–83.
A.
Botelho's first point of error contends that the
Appeals Board abused its discretion and acted without authority
because HRS § 386-94 only gives the Appeals Board "the power to
approve attorney's fees, not amend or set [the attorney's hourly
rate.]"  We disagree.  Botelho's argument was previously made
(also by Masui) in DeMello v. Gas Co., No. CAAP-15-0000527, 2016
WL 4272712 (Haw. App. Aug. 12, 2016) (mem.).  In that case we
held:
DeMello argues that the [Appeals Board] is not allowed to
set hourly rates, and must only consider the hourly rate
customarily awarded attorneys possessing similar skills and
experience.  Nothing in HRS § 386–94 precludes the [Appeals
Board] from employing the "lodestar method" of calculating
reasonable attorney's fees, under which reasonable
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
attorney's fees are calculated by [multiplying] the number
of hours reasonably expended[ ] by a reasonable hourly rate.2
DeMello, 2016 WL 4272712, at *3 (citing Kaleikini v. Yoshioka,
129 Hawai#i 454, 469, 304 P.3d 252, 267 (2013) (citing DFS Group
L.P. v. Paiea Props., 110 Hawai#i 217, 222, 131 P.3d 500, 505
(2006))) (footnote added).
The plain language of HRS § 386-94 authorizes the
Appeals Board to consider "the hourly rate customarily awarded
attorneys possessing similar skills and experience," among other
factors.  The list of factors for consideration includes those
usually and customarily taken into account in setting an
attorney's hourly billing rate, such as "the attorney's skill and
experience in state workers' compensation matters . . . and the
hourly rate customarily awarded attorneys possessing similar
skills and experience."  The list of factors in the statute "is
an inclusive list rather than an exhaustive one."  See State v.
DeMello, 136 Hawai# i 193, 196, 361 P.3d 420, 423 (2015)
(construing the phrase "including but not limited to" used in
criminal restitution statute, HRS § 706-646).  Thus, HRS § 386-94
does give the Appeals Board discretion to vary the requesting
attorney's hourly billing rate to arrive at an award of
"reasonable attorney's fees[.]"
B.
Botelho's second point of error argues that the Appeals
Board abused its discretion by failing to provide an explanation
supporting its reduction of Masui's hourly billing rate from $325
to $165.  Botelho is correct that the Appeals Board is required
to set forth its reasons for reducing an award of attorney's fees
and costs.  McLaren, 132 Hawai#i at 330, 321 P.3d at 681.  We
disagree that the Appeals Board in this case failed to provide a
reasonable explanation for its decision.
2Botelho does not challenge the Appeals Board's reduction of
Masui's total billed hours.
6NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
The burden is on the party seeking attorneys fees to
prove such fees were reasonably and necessarily incurred.  DFS
Grp. L.P. v. Paiea Properties, 110 Hawai#i 217, 226, 131 P.3d
500, 509 (2006).  Masui's fee application stated, "our fees for
the appellate portion is based on my civil rate of $325, and the
LAB Amended Request for Fees is based on the Director's previous
approved fee rate of $160."  In support of his application Masui
cited examples of non-workers' compensation civil cases in which
other lawyers' hourly rates ranging from $300 to $450 were
approved.  The application did not contain any information about
Masui's specific experience in workers' compensation secondary
appeal work, or about his level of experience in civil, criminal,
family, or administrative agency appellate practice.  The fee
application did not provide any information about the usual or
customary hourly billing rates of Hawai# i lawyers who practice
workers' compensation secondary appeals before the intermediate
court of appeals or the supreme court, or about the hourly
billing rates of any Hawai#i appellate practitioners, civil,
criminal, family, or administrative/secondary, at any experience
level.  Masui did not provide, or ask the Appeals Board to take,
judicial notice of any other potentially relevant facts.
The Appeals Board ruled based on the record before it:
5.In reviewing the subject fee request, the Board
took into account the benefits obtained for [Botelho] in
this appeal, the novelty and difficulty of issues involved
on appeal, the amount of fees awarded in similar appeals,
and the hourly rate customarily awarded workers'
compensation attorneys possessing similar skills and
experience, including [Masui]'s years of practice in the
field of workers' compensation law, the number of clients
represented before the Board, as well as [Masui]'s
responsiveness and timeliness.
6.In this case, the Board does not approve the
requested attorney hourly rate of $325.00.  [Masui]'s
approved hourly rate for the period 2009 through 2012 was
$165.00 per hour.
7.[Masui] has practiced in the field of workers'
compensation law in Hawaii for approximately 30 years.
8.[Masui] stated he represented approximately 100
clients before the Disability Compensation Division and
approximately 50 clients before the Board, in the past 3
years.
7NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Based upon the information — or rather, the lack thereof —
presented by Masui, the Appeals Board did not abuse its
discretion in reducing Masui's hourly billing rate for Botelho's
secondary appeal from $325 to $165.3
C.
Botelho's third point of error argues that the Appeals
Board abused its discretion by considering factors which were not
expressly enumerated by HRS § 386-94 and by limiting comparative
hourly billing rates to other workers' compensation attorneys. 
We disagree.
As was discussed above, in awarding attorneys fees
pursuant to HRS § 386-94 the Appeals Board "may consider factors
such as" those itemized in the statute.  The statute's use of the
phrase "such as" indicates that the list of factors "is an inclu-
sive list rather than an exhaustive one."  See State v. DeMello,
136 Hawai#i at 196, 361 P.3d at 423.  It was not an abuse of
discretion for the Appeals Board to consider factors in addition
to those enumerated by HRS § 386-94.
The plain language of HRS § 386-94 directs the Appeals
Board to consider "factors such as the attorney's skill and
experience in state workers' compensation matters . . . and the
hourly rate customarily awarded attorneys possessing similar
skills and experience."  The fees at issue in this case involve
an administrative agency secondary appeal (of a state workers'
compensation case) but the record contains no information that
the Appeals Board could have considered concerning Masui's skills
in or experience with state workers' compensation secondary
3We acknowledge that the supreme court remanded the McLaren case so
that the Appeals Board could explain its reasons for reducing the requested
attorney's fee award.  See also DeMello v. Gas Co.; Pickett v. Cheesecake
Factory Restaurants, Inc., No. CAAP-15-0000593, 2016 WL 4542742 (Haw. App.
Aug. 31, 2016) (mem.).  The fee reductions at issue in those cases were based
not only on a reduction of the hourly billing rate, but also reduction or
elimination of the amounts of time approved for various tasks.  The only issue
in this case is the reduction of Masui's hourly billing rate; the record on
appeal does not indicate that there is any information the Appeals Board
failed to consider or discuss in stating the reasons for its reduction of
Masui's hourly billing rate.
8NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
appeals.  The Appeals Board does not abuse its discretion by
failing to consider information which was not provided by any
party.
IV.
For the foregoing reasons, the Appeals Board's order
entered on April 20, 2016, reducing Botelho's attorney's hourly
billing rate from $325 to $165 is affirmed.
