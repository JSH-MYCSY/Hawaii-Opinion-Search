IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
JOHN DOE, Appellant-Appellant, v.
ATTORNEY GENERAL, CLARE E. CONNORS,  Appellee-Appellee 1
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 15-1-2158) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By:  Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Chan, JJ.) 
In this secondary appeal, Appellant-Appellant John Doe 
(Doe) appeals, pro se, from the April 7, 2016 Final Judgment 
entered on the April 6, 2016 Order Dismissing Notice of Appeal to Circuit Court by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court)
2 from the October 15, 2015 Department of the Attorney 
General (AG) declaratory ruling.  In this appeal, Doe contends that the Circuit Court erred when it ruled that the AG did not violate the law in issuing its determination that Doe was required to register as a sex offender under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 846E-1 (2014) based on his conviction in the State of Washington. 
After a careful review of the record on appeal and the 
relevant legal authorities, and giving due consideration to the 
1 Pursuant to Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP)
Rule 43(c)(1), Clare E. Connors, the current Attorney General of the State of
Hawai #i
 is automatically substituted as Appellee-Appellee herein in place of
Douglas S. Chin.

issues raised and the arguments made by the parties, we resolve 
Doe's appeal as follows and affirm. 
I.  Background.3 
Doe pleaded guilty to two counts of "Communicating with 
a Minor for Immoral Purposes" in violation of Revised Code of Washington (RCW) § 9.68A.090(1) (2006).
4  In addition to his 
sentence, the Superior Court of Washington for King County ordered Doe to register as a sex offender.
5 
In anticipation of a Hawaiian vacation, Doe petitioned 
the AG for a determination of whether, on the basis of his Washington conviction, he would be required to register as a sex offender in Hawai# i.  The AG determined that Doe's conviction 
"consisted of 'criminal sexual conduct toward a minor' and/or 'solicitation of a minor who is less than fourteen years old to engage in sexual conduct[,]'" as defined under HRS § 846E-1, thus requiring registration if he vacationed in Hawai# i for more than 
ten days consecutively or thirty days per year in the aggregate under HRS § 846E-2(a). 
The Circuit Court ruled that, "[c]omparing the 
definition of 'sexual offense' under chapter 846E, [HRS], with [RCW] § 9.68A.090, the Court cannot say that there was an error of law by [the AG] or that [the AG] violated the law in interpreting and comparing the two states' statutes".  On April 25, 2016, Doe filed his timely appeal to this court. 
3 A comprehensive statement of the prior history of this case can be
found in Doe v. Attorney Gen., 135 Hawai #i 390, 351 P.3d 1156 (2015).  
4 RCW § 9.68A.090(1) provides, in relevant part, "Except as provided
in subsection (2) of this section, a person who communicates with a minor for
immoral purposes, or a person who communicates with someone the personbelieves to be a minor for immoral purposes, is guilty of a grossmisdemeanor."  A gross misdemeanor carries a penalty of up to 354 days inprison and up to $5,000 fine, or both.  RCW § 9.92.020. 
5 See RCW § 9A.44.130(1)(a) (2011) ("Any adult . . . residing . . .
in this state who has been found to have committed or has been convicted of any sex offense . . . shall register with the county sheriff[.]"  A "Sex 
offense is defined as, inter alia , "[a]ny violation under RCW 9.68A.090
(communication with a minor for immoral purposes)[.]"  RCW § 9A.44.128(10) 
(2011).

II.  Discussion. 
Review of a decision made by the circuit court upon
its review of an agency's decision is a secondary appeal.
Chock v. Bitterman, 5 Haw. App. 59, 63, 678 P.2d 576, 580,cert. denied, 67 Haw. 685, 744 P.2d 781 (1984).  The standard of review is one in which [the appellate] court 
must determine whether the [circuit] court wasright or wrong in its decision, applying thestandards set forth in HRS § 91-14(g) to theagency's decision.  [This court's] review isfurther qualified by the principle that the[agency's] decision carries a presumption ofvalidity and [a]ppellant has the heavy burden ofmaking a convincing showing that the decision isinvalid because it is unjust and unreasonable inits consequences. 
Id. at 64, 678 P.2d at 580 (citations and footnote omitted). 
HRS § 91-14(g) provides: 
(g) Upon review of the record the court may
affirm the decision of the agency or remand the
case with instructions for further proceedings;or it may reverse or modify the decision andorder if the substantial rights of thepetitioners may have been prejudiced because theadministrative findings, conclusions, decisions,or orders are: 
(1) In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; or 
(2) In excess of the statutory authorityor jurisdiction of the agency; or 
(3) Made upon unlawful procedure;or 
(4) Affected by other error of law; or 
(5) Clearly erroneous in view ofthe reliable, probative, andsubstantial evidence on the whole record; or 
(6) Arbitrary, or capricious, orcharacterized by abuse of discretionor clearly unwarranted exercise ofdiscretion. 
HRS § 91-14(g) (1985). 
Under HRS § 91-14(g), conclusions of law are [freely]
reviewable under subsections (1), (2), and (4)[.] . . . Amfac, Inc. v. Waikiki Beachcomber Investment Co., 74 Haw.85, [119,] 839 P.2d 10, 28, recon. denied, 74 Haw. 650, 843P.2d 144 (1992).

3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Under HRS Chapter 846E, "Registration of Sex Offenders 
and Other Covered Offenders and Public Access to Registration 
Information" (Registration Statute), a "covered offender" is required to register as a sex offender with the AG.  HRS § 846E-2.  Under the definitions contained in HRS § 846E-1, "Covered 
offender" is, iter alia, a "sex offender" as defined therein.

"Sex offender" means: 
(1) A person who is or has been convicted at any time, whether
before or after May 9, 2005, of a "sexual offense"[.] 
. . . . 
"Sexual offense" means an offense that is: (1) Set forth in section 707-730(1), 707-731(1),
707-732(1), 707-733(1)(a), 707-733.6, 712-1202(1), or712-1203(1), but excludes conduct that is criminalonly because of the age of the victim, as provided insection 707-730(1)(b), or section 707-732(1)(b) if theperpetrator is under the age of eighteen; 
(2) An act defined in section 707-720 if the chargingdocument for the offense for which there has been a conviction alleged intent to subject the victim to asexual offense; 
(3) An act that consists of : 
(A) Criminal sexual conduct toward a minor,including but not limited to an offense setforth in section 707-759; 
(B) Solicitation
[7] of a minor who is less than 
6 HRS § 846E-2(a) (2014) provides, 
(a) A covered offender shall register with the attorney
general and comply with the provisions of this chapter for
life or for a shorter period of time as provided in this
chapter.  Registration under this subsection is required
whenever the covered offender, whether or not a resident of 
this State, remains in this State for more than ten days orfor an aggregate period exceeding thirty days in onecalendar year.  A covered offender shall be eligible to
petition the court in a civil proceeding for an order thatthe covered offender's registration requirements under thischapter be terminated, as provided in section 846E-10. 
(Emphasis added.) 
7 "Solicitation" is not defined in the Registration Statute or the 
Penal Code.  However, "[t]he words of a law are generally to be understood intheir most known and usual signification, without attending so much to theliteral and strictly grammatical construction of the words as to their generalor popular use or meaning."  HRS § 1-14 (2009).  Miriam-Webster defines solicitation as 
(continued...)

fourteen years old to engage in sexual conduct; 
(C) Use of a minor in a sexual performance; 
(D) Production, distribution, or possession of child
pornography chargeable as a felony under section707-750, 707-751, or 707-752; 
(E) Electronic enticement of a child chargeableunder section 707-756 or 707-757 if the offense was committed with the intent to promote orfacilitate the commission of another covered offense as defined in this section; or 
(F) Solicitation of a minor for prostitution inviolation of section 712-1209.1; 
(4) A violation of privacy under section 711-1110.9; 
(5) An act, as described in chapter 705, that is anattempt, criminal solicitation, or criminal conspiracyto commit one of the offenses designated in paragraphs(1) through (4); 
(6) A criminal offense that is comparable to or thatexceeds a sexual offense as defined in paragraphs (1)through (5); or 
(7) Any federal, military, out-of-state , tribal, or 
foreign conviction for any offense that under the laws
of this State would be a sexual offense as defined in paragraphs (1) through (6) . 
HRS § 846E-1 (emphases added).  Under subsection (7), Doe's out-
of-state conviction requires registration if the offense is "a 
7(...continued)
1 : the practice or act or an instance of soliciting
especially : entreaty, importunity 
2 : a moving or drawing force : incitement, allurement 
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/solicitation  and defines "solicit" 
as 
transitive verb 1 a : to make petition to : entreat 
b : to approach with a request or plea solicited Congress for funding 
2 : to urge (something, such as one's cause) strongly 
3 a : to entice or lure especially into evil 
b : to proposition (someone) especially as or inthe character of a prostitute 
4 : to try to obtain by usually urgent requests or pleassolicited donations 
intransitive verb 1 : to make solicitation : importune

https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/solicit .

sexual offense" as defined in paragraphs (1) through (6). 
Thus, Doe's out-of-state conviction would qualify as a 
sexual offense under subsection (7) if the conviction was for a 
sexual offense as defined in the previous six subsections. Subsection (3)(B) provides that "an act that consists of solicitation of a minor who is less than fourteen years old to engage in sexual conduct" would constitute such a "sexual offense." 
In support of his guilty plea, Doe provided the 
following "Statement of Facts": 
During the period between October 1, 2009 and October 31,
2009, on two separate occasions, I communicated with H.R.D.(DOB 4/16/1998), a person under 18 years of age, for animmoral purpose of a sexual nature.  This occurred in King County Washington. 
Based on the victim's date of birth and range of dates of the two 
crimes, the victim was eleven years old at the time of the offenses.  We agree with the AG's determination that communicating with an eleven-year-old for an immoral purpose of a sexual nature falls within the plain language of the sexual offense definition in HRS § 846E-1. 
In reaching this conclusion, we find it significant 
that the definition of sexual offense contained in subsection (3)(B), unlike some of the other subsections, does not rely on any other statutory provision for its meaning.  Compare subsection (1), which designates certain crimes as "set forth" in certain enumerated sections, where subsection (3)(B) designates an "act that consists of" the conduct described in that subsection.  Similarly, subsection (3)(C), includes "an act that consists of [the] use of a minor in a sexual performance" without reference to any crime defined outside of this definition.  By its choice of language, the Legislature has made manifest its intention that the conduct sought to be covered by the Registration Statute is not limited to those out-of-state convictions whose statutory definitions mirror, element by element, a crime defined in the Penal Code. 
Furthermore, we are convinced that the use of the word 
"solicitation" without limitation in subsection (3)(B), was meant in the more general sense and not necessarily confined to 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"criminal solicitation" as specifically provided in subsection 
(5). 
We therefore reject Doe's argument that the Washington 
statute under which he was convicted must "match up exactly" with a Hawai# i penal code provision for the Registration Statute to 
apply.  As stated in HRS § 846E-1, the out-of-state conviction must be a "sexual offense as defined in paragraphs (1) through (6)
of the definition of sexual offense contained in HRS 
§ 846E-1, not the Penal Code.8 
III.  Conclusion 
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Final Judgment 
entered on April 7, 2016, by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit.
