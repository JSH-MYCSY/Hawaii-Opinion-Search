OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
TANIA NAHOOPII, also known as Tanya Nahoopii, 
Defendant-Appellee
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CR. NO. 16-1-0075)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Reifurth, Presiding Judge, and Ginoza and Chan, JJ.)
On January 19, 2016, Plaintiff-Appellant State of
Hawai#i charged Defendant-Appellee Tania Nahoopii, also known as
Tanya Nahoopii, by Felony Information with the offense of
Burglary in the Second Degree in violation of Hawaii Revised
Statutes ("HRS") section 708-811 (2014).1/  The charge was based
on Defendant's violation of a trespass warning previously issued
to her by Longs Drugs Stores, Inc.
Defendant filed a Motion to Dismiss Felony Information
as a Matter of Law ("Motion to Dismiss").  Defendant's motion
relied in large part on the decision of the Court of Appeals of
New Mexico in State v. Archuleta, 346 P.3d 390 (N.M. Ct. App.
1/The statue provides
(1) A person commits the offense of burglary in the
second degree if the person intentionally enters or remains
unlawfully in a building with intent to commit therein a crime
against a person or against property rights.
(2) Burglary in the second degree is a class C felony.
Haw. Rev. Stat. ยง 708-811.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
2014).
The Circuit Court of the First Circuit ("Circuit
Circuit")2/ held a hearing on the Motion to Dismiss.  After
hearing argument, the Circuit Court granted Defendant's motion. 
The court explained:
All right.  Court's carefully considered the merits of
the instant motion within the context of the evidentiary
record and opposition memo filed. I'll note that while the
burglary statute appears to, essentially, be clear and
normally would not lend itself to a need to consider
legislative history, the Court believes it's appropriate under
these circumstances to do so and -- looking at the reasons
behind the Burglary Second statute, and the Court believes
that the application to the circumstances in this case is an
unfair extension of that statute. And with that, I'll note
that it's because the type of harm that is involved in these
type of commercial -- essentially a shoplifting case where an
individual has been trespassed that -- that it does not
involve the same type of concerns that underlie the burglary
statute, which is, essentially, the invasion of one's private
space, in particular the risk of potential terrorization of
the occupants. And here, as a matter of law, Court believes
that it is an unfair extension of that particular provision as
applied here.
   
And so I will grant the motion. And I am persuaded
especially by the Archuleta  decision, although not binding
upon the Court, the reasoning contained therein. In this
Court's view it is very persuasive. And so the Burglary Second
charge will be dismissed with prejudice. However, the State
will be permitted, if it sees fit, to file charges, in
particular a Theft 4 charge and/or a Trespass charge provided
they believe the evidence supports a filing of either of those
charges. So it will be with prejudice as to the Burg Second,
without prejudice specifically as to Trespass or Theft in the
Fourth Degree. 
On March 28, 2016, the Circuit Court entered the
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Granting Motion
to Dismiss Felony Information as a Matter of Law ("Order Granting
Motion to Dismiss"), which dismissed the charge of Burglary in
the Second Degree with prejudice, but dismissed any charge of
Criminal Trespass in the Second Degree or Theft in the Fourth
Degree arising out of the incident without prejudice.3/  The
State timely appealed.
2/The Honorable Rom A. Trader presided.
3/Although included within the Order Granting Motion to Dismiss, the
State does not address the Circuit Court's dismissal without prejudice of any
charge of Criminal Trespass in the Second Degree or Theft in the Fourth Degree
arising out of the incident in its opening brief.  Therefore, we deem those
issues waived.

Subsequent to the State's filing of this appeal, the
Hawai#i Supreme Court issued its decision in State v. King, 139
Hawai#i 249, 386 P.3d 886 (2016), holding that the violation of a
trespass warning may not serve as the basis for a charge of
Burglary in the Second Degree.  The relevant circumstances of
this case are indistinguishable from those in King.
In King, the supreme court held that the violation of a
trespass warning "issued pursuant to HRS ยง 708-814(1)(b) is
not a 'defi[ance] of a lawful order' under HRS ยง 708-800," and
therefore, the violation of a trespass warning "cannot be made
a vehicle for a second-degree burglary charge under HRS ยง 708-
811."  Id. at 257, 386 P.3d at 894 (brackets in original).
