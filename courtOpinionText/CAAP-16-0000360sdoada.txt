IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
SEAN KEAHI MANWELL, Defendant-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CR. NO. 15-1-0217) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By:  Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Chan, JJ.) 
Plaintiff-Appellant State of Hawai# i (State) appeals 
from the Circuit Court of the First Circuit's (Circuit Court) 
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law & Order Dismissing Indictment (Order) without prejudice against Defendant-Appellee Sean Keahi Manwell (Manwell), entered on March 29, 2016.
1 
On appeal, the State contends that the Circuit Court 
abused its discretion in dismissing the Indictment2 when it 
1 The Honorable Rom A. Trader entered the Order for the Honorable 
Dexter D. Del Rosario, who presided at the January 13, 2016 hearing on 
Manwell's motion to dismiss the indictment. 
2 The February 12, 2015 Indictment charged Manwell with one count of
Terroristic Threatening in the First Degree (TT1) against three individuals inviolation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 707-716 (2014), which provides,in relevant part, 
(1) A person commits the offense of terroristic
threatening in the first degree if the person commitsterroristic threatening: 
. . . . 
(e) With the use of a dangerous instrument[.] 
(continued...) NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
concluded that (1) the definition of "true threat" must be 
included in the indictment, and (2) the independent Grand Jury counsel's (GJC) failure to provide the legal definition of "terroristic threatening" and "terrorize" to the Grand Jury denied Manwell due process of law. 
Upon review of the record on appeal and relevant legal 
authorities, giving due consideration to the issues raised and arguments advanced by the parties, we resolve the State's appeal as follows and affirm. 
An indictment must "sufficiently allege all of the 
essential elements of the offense."  State v. Wheeler
, 121 
Hawai# i 383, 391, 219 P.3d 1170, 1178 (2009) (internal quotation 
marks omitted; quoting 
State v. Jendrusch, 58 Haw. 279, 281, 567 
P.2d 1242, 1244 (1977); see also
 Hawai# i Rules of Penal Procedure 
(HRPP) Rule 7(d) (requiring that the charge contain a "plain, concise and definite statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged.").  In addition, the charge "must be specific enough to ensure that the grand jury [] had before it all the facts necessary to find probable cause."  
State 
v. Israel
, 78 Hawai# i 66, 70, 890 P.2d 303, 307 (1995) (internal 
quotation marks omitted; quoting 
State v. Daly, 4 Haw. App. 52, 
54 n.6, 659 P.2d 83, 85 n.6 (1983)).  "Whether an indictment or complaint sets forth all the essential elements of a charged offense is a question of law, which [the appellate court reviews] under the de novo, or right/wrong, standard."  State v. Young
, 
107 Hawai# i 36, 39, 109 P.3d 677, 680 (2005) (citation, internal 
quotation marks, brackets, and ellipsis omitted). 
"The elements of an offense are such (1) conduct, 
(2) attendant circumstances, and (3) results of conduct, as: (a) are specified by the definition of the offense, and (b)  negative a defense[.]"  HRS ยง 702-205 (2014) (format 
altered); Wheeler, 121 
Hawai# i at 391 n.10, 219 P.3d at 1178 
n.10.  The Hawai# i Supreme Court has recognized that "any 
2(...continued) 
. . . . 
(2) Terroristic threatening in the first degree
is a class C felony. 
2  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
circumstances defined in an offense that are neither conduct nor 
the results of conduct would, by default, constitute attendant circumstances elements of the offense."  State v. Murray, 116 Hawai# i 3, 8, 169 P.3d 955, 960 (2007) (internal quotation marks 
and brackets omitted; quoting State v. Aiwohi, 109 Hawai# i 115, 
127, 123 P.3d 1210, 1222 (2005)).  
This court has observed that whether the defendant's 
conduct "bore the attributes of a 'true threat'" constituted attendant circumstances.  In re PP
, 133 Hawai# i 235, 240, 325 
P.3d 647, 652 (App. 2014).  In 
State v. Chung, 75 Haw. 398, 416-
17, 862 P.2d 1063, 1072-73 (1993), the Hawai# i Supreme Court 
adopted the holding of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in 
United States v. Kelner
, 534 F.2d 1020, 1026-27 (2d Cir. 1976) 
that 
threats punishable consistently with the First Amendment
[are] only those which according to their language andcontext conveyed a gravity of purpose and likelihood ofexecution so as to constitute speech beyond the pale ofprotected 'vehement, caustic [and] unpleasantly sharpattacks. . . .  So long as the threat on its face and in thecircumstances in which it is made is so unequivocal,unconditional, immediate and specific as to the personthreatened, as to convey a gravity of purpose and imminentprospect of execution, the statute may properly be applied." 
(Format altered.) 
In State v. Valdivia, 95 Hawai# i 465, 476, 24 P.3d 661, 
672 (2001), the supreme court acknowledged that the definition of 
"threat" for the purposes of HRS ยง 707-7153 was narrowed to "true 
threats."  This narrowed definition differs from the common, everyday usage and understanding of the term "threat," which is not limited to threats that are unconditional, or immediate.  See Merriam-Webster, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/threat ("(1) an expression of intention to inflict evil, injury, or damage; 
3 HRS ยง 707-715(1) (2014) provides, in pertinent part: 
Terroristic threatening, defined.   A person commits the
offense of terroristic threatening if the person threatens,
by word or conduct, to cause bodily injury to another personor serious damage or harm to property, including the pets orlivestock, of another or to commit a felony: 
(1) With the intent to terrorize, or in reckless disregard
of the risk of terrorizing, another person[.] 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2) one that threatens; or (3) an indication of something 
impending") and Dictionary.com, https://www.dictionary.com/browse/threat ("(1) a declaration of an intention or determination to inflict punishment, injury, etc., in retaliation for, or conditionally upon, some action or course; menace:  He confessed under the threat of imprisonment; (2) an indication or warning of probable trouble:  The threat of a storm was in the air; (3) a person or thing that threatens.") 
The Indictment issued in this case charged that, 
On or about March 18, 2013, in the City and County of
Honolulu, State of Hawai i #, SEAN KEAHI MANWELL threatened
Adam Arguin and/or Deslynn Ching and/or Thor Ching, by wordor conduct, to cause bodily injury to Adam Arguin and/orDeslynn Ching and/or Thor Ching, with the use of a dangerousinstrument, with the intent to terrorize, or in recklessdisregard of the risk of terrorizing Adam Arguin and/orDeslynn Ching and/or Thor Ching, thereby committing theoffense of Terroristic Threatening in the First Degree, inviolation of Section 707-716(1)(e) of the Hawai i # Revised 
Statutes. 
The Indictment does not contain a definition of the term 
"threatened". 
As attendant circumstances that are part of the 
definition of the offense must be included in the charge, and a true threat has a more limited meaning than that in common usage, it was not error for the Circuit Court to issue its Order dismissing the instant Indictment in which no definition of the term "threatened" was stated. 
Our resolution of this issue makes it unnecessary to 
address the remaining issue on appeal. 
For the foregoing reasons, the March 29, 2016 Findings 
of Fact, Conclusions of Law & Order Dismissing Indictment entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.
