IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 10-1-0341(1))

 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
appellate jurisdiction over Defendant-Appellant Lisa Rene
 
Joslin's (Appellant Joslin) appeal from the Honorable Rhonda I.L.
 Loo's March 29, 2016 amended judgment, because the March 29, 2016
 amended judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appealable final judgment under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 
§ 641-1(a) (2016), Hawai 'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 
54(b), HRCP Rule 58, and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte
 Fleming & Wright 
, 76 Hawai 'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 
(1994).
 
Under HRS § 641-1(a), an "appeal may be taken from
 
circuit court orders resolving claims against parties only after
 the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has
 been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties
 pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Id. at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. 
Furthermore,

 
if a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a case
involving multiple claims or multiple parties, the judgment
(a) must specifically identify the party or parties for and

against whom the judgment is entered, and (b) must (i)
identify the claims for which it is entered, and
(ii) dismiss any claims not specifically identified[.]
 
Id. (emphases added).
 
For example: "Pursuant to the jury verdict entered on
(date), judgment in the amount of $___ is hereby entered in
favor of Plaintiff X and against Defendant Y upon counts I
through IV of the complaint." A statement that declares
 "there are no other outstanding claims" is not a judgment.
If the circuit court intends that claims other than those
 listed in the judgment language should be dismissed, it must
say so: for example, "Defendant Y's counterclaim is
dismissed," or "Judgment upon Defendant Y's counterclaim is
entered in favor of Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all
other claims, counterclaims, and cross-claims are
dismissed."
 
Id. at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4.
 
When interpreting the requirements for a judgment under
 
HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai 'i has explained that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality, . . . and we should not make such searches
necessary by allowing the parties the option of waiving the
requirements of HRCP [Rule] 58.

Id. at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. In other words, a single judgment
 
document must, on its face, contain operative language to resolve
 all claims in the case so that a search of the record for prior
 dispositive orders is not necessary. Simply referring to, or
 incorporating by reference, a prior judgment that the circuit
 court intends to amend is insufficient. The finding necessary
 for certification under HRCP Rule 54(b) is that there is "no just
 reason for delay" in the entry of judgment as to one or more but
 fewer than all claims or parties.
 
The March 29, 2016 amended judgment neither resolves
 
all claims against all parties nor contains the finding necessary
 for certification under HRCP Rule 54(b). For example, although
 the March 29, 2016 amended judgment expressly enters judgment in
 favor of Plaintiff-Appellee Ledcor-US Pacific Construction LLC
 (Appellee Ledcor) and against Appellant Joslin as to Appellee
 Ledcor's cause of action for "misrepresentation," the March 29,
 2016 amended judgment neither enters judgment on nor dismisses
 the other four causes of action in Appellee Ledcor's five-count
 May 25, 2010 complaint. In addition, the March 29, 2016 amended
 judgment does not contain an express finding of no just reason
 for delay in the entry of judgment as to one or more but fewer
 than all claims or parties. Therefore, the March 29, 2016
 amended judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an
 appealable final judgment under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 § 641-1(a) (2016), HRCP Rule 54(b), HRCP Rule 58, or the holding
 in Jenkins. 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Absent an appealable final judgment, we lack appellate
 
jurisdiction and Appellant Joslin's appeal is premature.
 
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
 
case number CAAP-16-0000361 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 
jurisdiction.
