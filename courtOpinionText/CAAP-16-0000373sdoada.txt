STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
PAUL STEPHEN GLEED, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 3DTC-15-052965)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise and Reifurth, JJ., and
Nakamura, C.J., concurring separately)
 
Defendant-Appellant Paul Stephen Gleed appeals from the
 
Judgment and Notice of Entry of Judgment, filed on March 4, 2016
 
in the District Court of the Third Circuit ("District Court").1
 
Gleed was convicted of Excessive Speeding, in violation of Hawaii
 Revised Statutes section 291C-105(a)(2) (2007). 
On appeal, Gleed contends that: (1) the charge was 
insufficient for failing to allege that the offense occurred on a highway; (2) the District Court failed to conduct an adequate colloquy under Tachibana v. State, 79 Hawai
'i 226, 900 P.2d 1293 
(1995) and failed to obtain a waiver of his right to testify; (3) the District Court erred by admitting the radar gun speed reading because it lacked proper foundation; and (4) the District Court

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
plainly erred by admitting Gleed's traffic citation into evidence
 
because it was not relevant and was hearsay.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Gleed's points of error as follows:
 
In conducting the "ultimate" Tachibana colloquy, the 
District Court did not obtain an on-the-record waiver of the right to testify directly from Gleed, but instead accepted the implicit representation of Gleed's counsel that Gleed did not want to testify. In doing so, the District Court failed to comply with the requirements of Tachibana and failed to obtain a valid waiver of Gleed's right to testify. State v. Staley, 91 
Hawai
'i 275, 286-87, 982 P.2d 904, 915-16 (1999). This error was 
not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See State v. Hoang, 94 
Hawai'i 271, 279–90, 12 P.3d 371, 379–80 (App. 2000)); State v. 
Cooper, No. CAAP-15-0000646, 2017 WL ____, at *_ (Hawai 'i App. 
June 28, 2017). 
We consider then whether there was sufficient evidence 
to warrant remand for further proceedings or whether the judgment should be reversed. Gleed contends that the radar speed reading should not have been admitted into evidence because Hawai
'i 
Police Department Officer Kimo Keliipaakaua's testimony regarding a manual was hearsay and violated the best evidence rule and there was insufficient evidence that Officer Keliipaakaua was qualified to operate the radar gun and that the radar gun was tested according to the manufacturer's requirements. 
Here, the State failed to lay a sufficient foundation 
that Officer Keliipaakaua was qualified to operate the radar device used to determine the speed of Gleed's car. See State v. 
Amiral, 132 Hawai
'i 170, 178–79, 319 P.3d 1178, 1186–87 (2014); 
State v. Gonzalez, 128 Hawai 'i 314, 327, 288 P.3d 788, 801 
(2012); Cooper, 2017 WL _____, at *_. 
Based on the foregoing, we need not address Gleed's
 
first and fourth points of error and we reverse Gleed's
 conviction and the Judgment and Notice of Entry of Judgment,
