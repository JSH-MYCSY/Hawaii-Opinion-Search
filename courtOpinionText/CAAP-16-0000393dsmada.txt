STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
THOMAS CHARLES AIU, Defendant-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 5DTA-15-00239)

 
ORDER GRANTING THE AUGUST 15, 2016
MOTION TO DISMISS THE APPEAL
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of "Appellant State of Hawaii's 
Motion to Dismiss Appeal," filed August 15, 2016, by Plaintiff-
Appellant State of Hawai 'i (Appellant), "Defendant-Appellee's 
Statement of Objection to Appellant State of Hawaii's Motion to Dismiss Appeal [Filed August 15, 2016]," filed August 22, 2016, by Defendant-Appellee Thomas Charles Aiu (Appellee), the papers 
1
in support,  and the record, it appears that:
(1)
 In the underlying case, 5DTA-15-00239, Appellant
 
charged Appellee with, among other things, one count of Operating
 a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), in
 violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) and/or (a)(3);

 The court did not consider Appellant's August 29, 2016 reply to
Appellee's opposition because it was not authorized. See Hawai' i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 27(a). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
(2) Appellant appeals from the district court's 
April 27, 2016 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order
 
granting Appellee's motion to suppress evidence, in which the
 district court ruled that the results of Appellee's breath test
 was not admissible as evidence at trial;
 
(3) The appeal was docketed on July 11, 2016;
 (4) Pursuant to HRAP Rule 42(b), Appellant seeks to
 
dismiss the appeal and proceed to trial on the OVUII charge under
 HRS § 291E-61(a)(1), rather than (a)(3);
 
(5) Appellee objects to the "unconditional dismissal of 
the subject appeal," because, according to Appellee, the time from when the district court granted the motion to suppress until the time this appeal is dismissed should be counted for purposes of Hawai
'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 48 and the Sixth 
Amendment right to a speedy trial. Appellee requests "a finding that the delay associated with the aborted appeal is charged to Appellant"; 
(6) Appellant has provided valid grounds in support of
 
its motion to dismiss the appeal and dismissal of the appeal is
 appropriate. It is not necessary for this court to make any
 decision or finding on how the time related to this appeal should
 be treated for purposes of HRPP Rule 48 or the Sixth Amendment
 speedy trial right, and we decline to do so. Appellee may raise
 any claim or argument Appellee has regarding HRPP Rule 48 or the
 Sixth Amendment speedy trial right in the trial court.
 
(7) The opening brief was due on or before August 22,
 
2016. Appellant did not file the opening brief or request an
 extension of time;

(8) On August 24, 2016, the appellate clerk notified
 
Appellant that the time for filing the opening brief had expired,
 
the matter would be called to the court's attention on September
 6, 2016, for appropriate action, which could include dismissal of
 the appeal, and relief from default should be made by motion; and
 
(9) Although Appellant did not file a motion seeking
 
relief from default, it is warranted in this instance.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellant's 
August 15, 2016 motion to dismiss the appeal is granted, and the
 appeal is dismissed.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Appellant is relieved from 
default of the opening brief.
