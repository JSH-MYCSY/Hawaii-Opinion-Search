SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Dominador M. Lopez (Lopez) appeals
 
from the (1) "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order
 
Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment for Foreclosure
 Against All Defendants and for Interlocutory Decree of
 Foreclosure" (Order Granting Foreclosure), and (2) Judgment, both
 
entered on April 8, 2016, in the Circuit Court of the First
 
1
Circuit (circuit court).  The Order Granting Foreclosure and the

 The Honorable Karl K. Sakamoto presided. 
NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Judgment were entered in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee U.S. Bank
 
National Association, as Trustee for Structured Asset Investment
 Loan Trust Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2006-2
 (USBNA).
 
On appeal, Lopez primarily contends that (1) the
 
circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction; (2) the

 
attorney affirmation filed by USBNA's counsel was not in
 compliance with Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 667-17 (2016);
2
 
and (3) the circuit court erred in granting USBNA's motion for
 summary judgment because a genuine issue of material fact
 remained as to whether USBNA had standing to foreclose on the
 subject mortgage.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to

 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant legal authorities, we resolve Lopez's points
 of error as follows, and we vacate and remand.
 
In Bank of America, N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, the Hawai
'i 
Supreme Court recently held in a judicial foreclosure action that in order to establish a right to foreclose, the foreclosing plaintiff must establish standing, or entitlement to enforce the subject note, at the time the action was commenced. 139 Hawai
'i 
361, 367-70, 390 P.3d 1248, 1254-57 (2017). The holding in Reyes-Toledo is dispositive in this case. 
Reyes-Toledo notes that a foreclosing plaintiff must
 
typically "prove the existence of an agreement, the terms of the 

 
agreement, a default by the mortgagor under the terms of the
 agreement, and giving of the cancellation notice." Id. at 367,
 
390 P.3d at 1254 (citing Bank of Honolulu, N.A. v. Anderson, 3
 Haw. App. 545, 551, 654 P.2d 1370, 1375 (1982)). Furthermore,
 "[a] foreclosing plaintiff must also prove its entitlement to
 enforce the note and mortgage." Id. The supreme court then

   The complaint in this action was filed on December 10, 2012. The
 
"HRS ยง 667-17 Affirmation" by USBNA's counsel was filed on April 22, 2015.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
expressed that "[a] foreclosing plaintiff's burden to prove 
entitlement to enforce the note overlaps with the requirements of standing in foreclosure actions as 'standing is concerned with whether the parties have the right to bring suit.'" Id. 
(brackets omitted) (quoting Mottl v. Miyahira, 96 Hawai
'i 381, 
388, 23 P.3d 716, 723 (2001)). Because "standing relates to the invocation of the court's jurisdiction, it is not surprising that standing must be present at the commencement of the case." Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai
'i at 368, 390 P.3d at 1255. Thus, a 
foreclosing plaintiff must establish entitlement to enforce the note and standing to foreclose on the mortgaged property at the commencement of the suit. Id. 
Like the foreclosing bank in Reyes Toledo, USBNA was
 
granted a decree of foreclosure via a summary judgment ruling. 
In support of its summary judgment motion, USBNA attached, inter
 alia, two documents to demonstrate that it possessed the subject
 note: (1) a declaration of Morgan Battle Ames (Ames Declaration),
 
executed on October 28, 2015, attesting that "[USBNA] is in
 
possession of an original promissory note dated 01/04/2006"; and
 (2) the note, which shows that it was endorsed in blank on an
 allonge to the note. Like in Reyes-Toledo, this evidence fails
 to demonstrate that USBNA was entitled to enforce the note at the
 time the action commenced.
 
There also is no other evidence in the record to
 
establish USBNA's entitlement to enforce the note when it
 commenced this action. The Complaint for Foreclosure simply
 alleges that "Plaintiff is the holder of the Note[.]" The note
 is not attached to the complaint and there is no verification or
 other evidence submitted verifying that USBNA held the blank
 endorsed note at the time the complaint was filed.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Viewing the facts and inferences in the light most 
favorable to Lopez, as we must for purposes of a summary judgment 
ruling, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether USBNA was entitled to enforce the subject note at the time this foreclosure action was commenced. Therefore, the circuit court erred in granting USBNA's motion for summary judgment. Reyes 
Toledo, 139 Hawai
'i at 370-71, 390 P.3d at 1257-58. 
Given the above, we need not address Lopez's remaining
 
points on appeal. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Findings of
 
Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion
 for Summary Judgment for Foreclosure Against All Defendants and
 for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure" and the Judgment, both
 entered on April 8, 2016, in the Circuit Court of the First
 Circuit, are vacated. This case is remanded to the Circuit Court
 of the First Circuit for further proceedings.
