NO. CAAP-16-0000398
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
YURIE YAMANO, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
DOCTOR KEIICHI KOBAYASHI and

 
DOCTOR KATIE HUANG, Defendants-Appellees
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 14-1-2135 (RAN))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Yurie Yamano (
Yamano) appeals pro
 
se from the Order Denying Plaintiff's Ex Parte Motion to Expedite
 
the Demand for Final Judgment Pursuant to H.R. Civ. P. Rule 54,
 Filed April 14, 2016 (Order Denying Post-Judgment Motion), which
 
was entered on May 4, 2016, by the Circuit Court of the First
 
Circuit (Circuit Court).

On appeal, Yamano states four related points of error,
 
asserting that the Circuit Court: (1) erred by not issuing a
 final judgment and thereby violated Yamano's due process right to
 be heard under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-1; (2) abused

its discretion by failing to issue a final judgment in a separate
 
document; (3) abused its discretion for failing to issue a final
 judgment as according to law; and (4) abused its discretion "by
 not looking at the guaranteed Constitutional Right verses
 procedure of a subchapter of a state law that subverts that
 right."
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Yamano's points of error as follows: 
Defendants-Appellees Keiichi Kobayashi, M.D., and Katie 
Huang, M.D., (Appellees) correctly note that Yamano has failed to 
comply with various provisions in the Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP). Nevertheless, this court observes a policy of affording pro se litigants the opportunity "to have their cases 
heard on the merits, where possible." O'Connor v. Diocese of 
Honolulu, 77 Hawai
'i 383, 386, 885 P.2d 361, 364 (1994). 
The gravamen of Yamano's appeal is that she was denied 
due process with respect to an appeal from the dismissal of her medical malpractice claims against Appellees. All of Yamano's contentions appear to be based on her mistaken belief that the Circuit Court failed to reduce its dismissal orders to a final judgment that is appealable under HRS ยง 641-1(a) (2016). However, on August 20, 2015, the Circuit Court entered a Judgment that was an immediately appealable final judgment under HRS ยง 641-1(a), Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 58, and the

holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai 'i 
115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
Yamano did not file a notice of appeal within thirty
 
days after entry of the August 20, 2015 Judgment, as HRAP Rule
 
4(a)(1) requires for a timely appeal. The failure to file a
 timely notice of appeal in a civil matter is a jurisdictional
 defect that the parties cannot waive and the appellate courts
 cannot disregard in the exercise of judicial discretion. Bacon
 
v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1129 (1986); HRAP
 Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or justice is authorized to
 change the jurisdictional requirements contained in Rule 4 of
 these rules."); HRAP Rule 26(e) ("The reviewing court for good
 cause shown may relieve a party from a default occasioned by any
 failure to comply with these rules, except the failure to give
 timely notice of appeal."). Therefore, Yamano's appeal herein
 was untimely with respect to the August 20, 2015 Judgment and we
 lack appellate jurisdiction to review the August 20, 2015
 Judgment.
 
Nevertheless, the May 4, 2016 Order Denying 
Post-Judgment Motion was appealable under HRS ยง 641-1(a) as an independently appealable post-judgment order. See Ditto v. 
McCurdy, 103 Hawai
'i 153, 157, 80 P.3d 974, 978 (2003). Yamano 
filed her May 13, 2016 Notice of Appeal within thirty days after entry of the Order Denying Post-Judgment Motion, as HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) required for a timely appeal. Therefore, we have appellate jurisdiction to review the May 4, 2016 Order Denying Post-Judgment Motion.

However, as the Circuit Court did in fact enter a final
 
judgment on Yamano's complaint, the arguments raised in this
 
appeal are without merit.
 
Accordingly, the Circuit Court's May 4, 2016 Order
 
Denying Post-Judgment Motion is affirmed.
