(CASE NOS. 2DTA-15-01298 and 2DTC-14-004621)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Vicente L. Domut, also known as
 
Vicente Domut (Domut) appeals from the April 20, 2016 District
 
Court of the Second Circuit, Wailuku Division's (District Court)
 Judgment and Notice of Entry of Judgment.
1 After a bench trial,
 
the District Court convicted Domut in Count 1 of Driving Without
 License (DWOL), in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 § 286-102 (2007),
2 and in Count 2 of No Motor Vehicle Insurance
 
(NMVI), in violation of HRS § 431:10C-104(a)3 (2005).4 Domut was

sentenced to 180 days in Count 1, and a fine of $1500 in Count 2,
 
inter alia.
 
On appeal, Domut contends the State failed to present
 
sufficient evidence: (1) that Domut did not fall into one or
 more of the statutory exemptions to DWOL; and (2) to negate
 Domut's statutory good faith defense to NMVI.
 
After a careful review and consideration of the
 
parties' arguments, the record on appeal, and legal authorities,
 we resolve Domut's points on appeal as follows and affirm his
 conviction.
 
1. The State produced sufficient evidence to prove
 
Domut's DWOL conviction as, taking the evidence in the light most
 favorable to the prosecution, State v. Timoteo, 87 Hawai' i 108, 
112-13, 952 P.2d 865, 869-70 (1997), there was substantial
 evidence he did not have a valid driver's license. Domut asserts
 the State failed to demonstrate that he was not exempted from
 licensure pursuant to HRS § 286-102.
 
HRS § 286-102(a) then provided: 
No person, except one exempted under section 286-105, one
who holds an instruction permit under section 286-110, one
who holds a provisional license under section 286-102.6, one
who holds a commercial driver's license issued under section
 286-239, or one who holds a commercial driver's license
instruction permit issued under section 286-236, shall
operate any category, of motor vehicles listed in this
section without first being appropriately examined and duly
licensed as a qualified driver of that category of motor
vehicles.
 
Domut contends that the State failed to prove that he was not
 
exempted from licensure pursuant to HRS § 286-1055 (2007). Domut
 
3(...continued)
shall operate or use a motor vehicle upon any public street,
road, or highway of this State at any time unless such motor
vehicle is insured at all times under a motor vehicle
 insurance policy.

 This appeal represents two district court case numbers, 2DTC-14­
004621 and 2DTA-15-01298, which were consolidated for trial. In 2DTA-15­01298, Domut was convicted of Failure to Appear pursuant to HRS § 803-6(e).In 2DTC-14-004621, Domut was prosecuted for the DWOL and NMVI charges. The Failure to Appear conviction was not appealed, insofar as Domut has presentedno points on appeal nor arguments challenging this conviction. Therefore, anychallenge to this conviction is waived. Hawai 'i Rules of Appellate Procedure
(HRAP) Rule 28(b).

 HRS § 286-105 then provided:
 
What persons are exempt from license.  The following persons
are exempt from license:

relies on State v. Matautia, 81 Hawai' i 76, 83, 912 P.2d 573, 580 
(App. 1996), in which this court suggested the State must prove
 
the defendant "was not excepted by statute from the driver's
 licensing requirements." However, in State v. Castillon, we
 explicitly overruled this interpretation of Matautia. State v.
 
Castillon, 140 Hawai' i 242, 247, 398 P.3d 831, 836 (App. 2017), 
cert. granted, No. SCWC-16-0000421, 2017 WL 5899258 (Haw.
 Nov. 29, 2017) (citing State v. Lee, 90 Hawai' i 130, 138, 976 
P.2d 444, 452 (1999)). Instead, we held that the statutory
 
5(...continued)
(1)	 Any person while driving or operating a motor
vehicle in the service or employ of any branch
or agency of the federal government; provided
that the person has received a license or permit
from the branch or agency to operate and drive
the motor vehicle; provided further that the
branch or agency has been duly authorized by the
federal government to issue the license or
permit;
 (2)	 Any person while driving or operating any road
machine, farm tractor, or implement of husbandry
temporarily operated or moved on a highway;
provided that no person under the age of
thirteen years shall be permitted to drive or
operate any such road machine, farm tractor, or
implement of husbandry on a highway;
 (3)	 Any person who is at least eighteen years of age
and who has in the person's possession a valid
driver's license to drive the categories of
motor vehicles listed in section 286-102(b),
except section 286-102(b)(4), that is equivalent
to a driver's license issued in this State but
 was issued to the person in another state of the
United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,
United States Virgin Islands, American Samoa,
Guam, a province of the Dominion of Canada, or
the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands
 for that category of motor vehicle which the
person is operating;
 (4)	 Any person who has in the person's possession a
valid commercial motor vehicle driver's license
 issued by any state of the United States,
Mexico, or a province of the Dominion of Canada
that issues licenses in accordance with the
 minimum federal standards for the issuance of
 commercial motor vehicle driver's licenses; and
 (5)	 Any person who drives or operates state or
county motor vehicles while employed by, in the
service of, or volunteering for the state or
county fire departments, provided that they are
trained and certified to drive category (4)
motor vehicles as set forth in section
 286-102(b)(4) by the state or county government,
as appropriate, and provided that the person
maintains a category (3) license as set forth in
section 286-102(b)(3).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
exemptions in HRS § 286-102(a) constitute defenses to the DWOL
 
offense. Id. Here, Domut did not offer any evidence that he
 
qualified for any of the statutory exemptions, and the burden
 never shifted to the State to disprove an exemption. We
 therefore conclude the State presented sufficient evidence to
 convict Domut of DWOL.
 
2. Domut contends the State failed to present
 
sufficient evidence to negate Domut's good faith defense to NMVI. 
Specifically, Domut argues the State failed to produce evidence
 to rebut the HRS § 431:10C-117(a)(4) (2005) and (Supp. 2017) good
 faith defense raised by its own witnesses.
 
HRS § 431:10C-117(a)(4) provides, in relevant part:
 
Any person cited under this section shall have an
opportunity to present a good faith defense, including but
not limited to lack of knowledge or proof of insurance. The
general penalty provision of this section shall not apply
to:
 
. . . .
 (C)	 Any operator of a borrowed motor vehicle if the
operator holds a reasonable belief that the subject
vehicle is insured[.]
 
Interpreting this section, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i held, 
"[t]he lack of knowledge defense is not an affirmative defense." 
State v. Bolosan, 78 Hawai' i 86, 89, 890 P.2d 673, 676 (1995). 
Once evidence of facts comprising the defense are raised, the State has the burden of disproving the defense beyond a reasonable doubt. See id. 
Domut asserts that evidence of the vehicle being 
registered in another person's name, that there were two other adults in the car, and that the registration was current are facts sufficient to imply that he borrowed the vehicle. In Lee, the supreme court recognized that the defendant bears the burden of production to raise the NVMI defense. Lee, 90 Hawai' i at 140, 
976 P.2d at 454. There, Lee brought forth no evidence that he had borrowed the subject vehicle and, thus, could not rely on the "borrower's 'good faith lack of knowledge' defense." Id. at 
139–40, 976 P.2d at 453–54; see also State v. Kahaunaele, 10 Haw. App. 519, 879 P.2d 566 (1994) (seven consolidated defendants raised the HRS § 431:10C-117(a)(4) defense by presenting evidence 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
subject vehicles were borrowed). Here, there was no evidence
 
presented as to any borrower/lender relationship between Domut
 and the registered owner. The facts that Domut posits, without
 more, do not provide a logical basis to infer the car was
 borrowed. Therefore, Domut's argument that the State failed to
 rebut the HRS § 431:10C-117(a)(4) defense is without merit.
 
For the foregoing reasons, the April 20, 2016 Judgment
 
and Notice of Entry of Judgment entered by the District Court of
 the Second Circuit, Wailuku Division, is affirmed.
