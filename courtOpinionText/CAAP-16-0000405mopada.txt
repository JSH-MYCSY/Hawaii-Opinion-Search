OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
RYAN K. STONE, Petitioner-Appellant,
v.
ADMINISTRATIVE DIRECTOR OF THE COURTS, 
Respondent-Appellee,
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
HONOLULU DIVISION
(CASE NO. 1DAA-16-00001)
MEMORANDUM OPINION
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Hiraoka, JJ.)
In this secondary appeal, Petitioner-Appellant Ryan K.
Stone (Stone ) appeals from the District Court of the First
Circuit (District Court) "Decision and Order Affirming
Administrative Revocation" (District Court Order) filed on April
19, 2016.   1
On appeal, Stone argues that the District Court erred
when it affirmed the Administrative Driver's License Revocation
Office's ( ADLRO) revocation of his license because: (1) "[t]he
ADLRO process is materially and inextricably related to [sic]
criminal [Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an 
1  The Honorable Lono J. Lee presided.NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Intoxicant (OVUII)] prosecution"; and (2) "[a]n unsigned by
handwritten signature police report is an unsworn police report." 
For the following reasons discussed below, we affirm.
I.  Background
Stone was arrested for OVUII, pursuant to Hawaii
Revised Statutes (HRS ) § 291E-61(a) (2007).  While Stone was in
custody, he was read HPD-396K form, titled "Use of Intoxicants
While Operating a Vehicle Implied Consent for Testing," which
stated, in relevant part:
Pursuant to chapter 291E Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS), Use
of Intoxicants While Operating a Vehicle, you are being
informed of the following:
1.Any Person who operates a vehicle upon a public way,
street, road, or highway or on or in the waters of the
State shall be deemed to have given consent to a test
or tests for the purpose of determining alcohol
concentration or drug content of the persons [sic]
breath, blood, or urine as applicable.
. . . .
3.You may refuse to submit to a breath or blood test or
both for the purpose of determining alcohol
concentration and or blood or urine test, or both for
the purpose of determining drug content, none shall be
given, except as provided in section 291E-21. 
However, if you refuse to submit to a breath, blood,
or urine test, you shall be subject to up to thirty
days imprisonment and or fine up to $1,000 or the
sanctions of 291E-65, if applicable.  In addition, you
shall also be subject to the procedures and sanctions
under chapter 291E part III.
Stone refused the breath and blood tests. 
While in custody, Stone was also read [Honolulu Police
Department ( HPD)] 396B1-B4 form, titled "Sanctions for Use of
Intoxicants While Operating a Vehicle & Implied Consent for
Testing," which stated, in relevant part: 
Pursuant to chapter 291E, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS), Use
of Intoxicants While Operating a Vehicle, you are being
informed of the following:
1.If you choose to take an alcohol concentration test
and the test result is below the legal limit of 0.08,
the administrative revocation proceedings will be
terminated with prejudice. 
. . . .
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
7.The administrative revocation of driver's license
consequences for taking or refusing to take a test are
as follows:
a.If you refuse to take any tests and your record
shows no prior alcohol or drug enforcement
contact during the five years preceding the date
the notice of administrative revocation was
issued, your license and privilege to operate a
vehicle will be revoked for a period of two
years.
However, if you choose to take a test and fail it,
your license and privilege to operate a vehicle will
be revoked for one year.
. . . .
12.If you refuse to be tested, criminal charges may be
filed against you under Part IV, Prohibited Conduct,
section 291E or if applicable, you may be subject to
the sanctions of section 291E-65.
Stone again refused the breath and blood test.  
Stone was read and provided with a "Notice of
Administrative Revocation" form, which Stone refused to sign. 
This form stated, in relevant part, that Stone was being provided
with a temporary driver's permit while his license was forwarded
to the ADLRO for a determination of whether his license would be
revoked.  
Stone's arrest was documented in police incident
reports. 
The ADLRO revoked Stone's driver's license.  Stone
requested an administrative hearing to review the revocation. 
The ADLRO sustained the revocation, and on March 16, 2016,
released its "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Decision"
(ADLRO Decision ) affirming the revocation.  Stone petitioned for
review of the ADLRO Decision in the District Court. 
Subsequently, the District Court Order was entered affirming the
ADLRO.  Stone appeals from the District Court Order. 
II.  Discussion
A.  Won Does Not Apply
Stone argues that the language in the HPD implied
consent forms ( implied consent forms ) were "inherently coercive," 
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
and not "substantively legal," and thus the ADLRO's finding of
driving while impaired was "negate[d]." 
Stone refers to the Hawai#i Supreme Court Decisions
State v. Yong Shik Won, 137 Hawai# i 330, 372 P.3d 1065 (2015) and
State v. Wilson, 92 Hawai#i 45, 987 P.2d 268 (1999) to support
his argument. 
The Court in Won explained that under HRS § 291E-11
(Supp. 2006), "[e]very person who drives on the roads of Hawai# i
is deemed to have given consent to a BAC[ ] test when suspected
of OVUII."  137 2
Hawai#i at 344, 372 P.3d at 1079.  However,
before the test is administered, the driver must be informed that
they may refuse testing and thereby withdraw consent.  Id.  The
Supreme Court ruled that because there is a constitutional right
to be free from warrantless search and seizure, if the driver
does consent to testing, that consent must be "voluntary" and
"uncoerced" and consent to a search may be withdrawn.  Id. at
338-41, 344, 372 P.3d at 1073-76, 1079.  
Won was arrested for OVUII, and while under arrest, he
was read an Implied Consent Form.  Id. at 334, 372 P.3d at 1069. 
The form stated that as a driver he had given consent to be
tested for the concentration of alcohol in his breath, blood, or
urine, and that he could refuse these tests, but that there were
penalties for such a refusal: the civil revocation of his license
and a criminal sanction.  Id. at 334-35, 372 P.3d at 1069-70. 
The criminal sanction was "up to thirty days in jail, a fine not
exceeding $1,000, and imposition of community service and payment
of other assessments and fees."  Id. at 334, 372 P.3d at 1069
(footnotes omitted). Won initialed the form where it said that he
agreed to take a breath test, but refused the blood test, and
signed the bottom of the form.  Id. at 335, 372 P.3d at 1070.  A
breath test was performed, Won was found to be over the limit,
and he was ultimately found guilty of OVUII.  Id. at 335-36, 372
P.3d at 1070-71.
2  A BAC test is a blood alcohol concentration or content test.  
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Won appealed and the Hawai#i Supreme Court ultimately
agreed with him that he did not submit to the breath test freely
and voluntarily because his "statutory and constitutional right
to refuse consent was criminalized."  Id. at 336, 372 P.3d at
1071.  The Supreme Court held that Won did not voluntarily
consent to the breath test because he was effectively coerced
into giving his consent under the threat of criminal sanction. 
Id. at 348-49, 372 P.3d at 1083-84.
In the instant case, Stone attempts to extend the
ruling in Won to the civil administrative revocation procedure
for OVUIIs.  Stone argues that because the language in the
implied consent forms that were provided to him is the same as
the language used in Won, the forms provided to Stone were " per
se illegal."  He reasons that because the forms were illegal, his
civil OVUII driver's license revocation was improper. 
Stone's argument is without merit.  In Won, the Supreme
Court explicitly and repeatedly stated that its ruling did not
apply to OVUII civil revocation proceedings.  At the very outset,
the Court prefaces its opinion by very pointedly stating: 
Hawai#i law provides two categories of penalties for drivers
that refuse to submit to a BAC test.  The first is an
extended revocation period of the person's driver's license
in an administrative process applicable to all persons
arrested for OVUII.  HRS § 291E–41(d) (Supp.2010); see
generally HRS Chapter 291E, Part III.  The administrative
license revocation process is "civil in nature."  State v.
Severino, 56 Haw. 378, 380, 537 P.2d 1187, 1189 (1975). 
This court has upheld civil license revocation on several
occasions.  See, e.g., Dunaway v. Admin. Dir. of Courts, 108
Hawai#i 78, 87, 117 P.3d 109, 118 (2005); Kernan v. Tanaka,
75 Haw. 1, 22, 856 P.2d 1207, 1218 (1993); Severino, 56 Haw.
at 380–81, 537 P.2d at 1189.  The civil revocation of
driver's licenses under HRS Chapter 291E, Part III, is not
an issue in this case.
Id. at 334, 372 P.3d at 1069 (footnotes omitted).  Furthermore,
to ensure that it is clear, Won states in a footnote: "[i]t bears
repeating here that this opinion does not concern the civil
administrative penalties attendant to a driver's refusal of BAC
testing.  Those types of sanctions are not affected in any way by
our decision."  Id. at 349 n.34, 372 P.3d at 1084 n.34 (emphasis
added) (citation omitted).
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
In addition to the Supreme Court's explicit
instructions, the factual differences between Won and the instant
case demonstrate that Won cannot be extended to this case.  In
Won, the defendant was informed that if he did not submit to a
BAC test he would be criminally sanctioned, and under this threat
of criminal penalty, Won consented to a breath test.  Id. at 333,
372 P.3d at 1068.  Thus, Won argued, and the Supreme Court
agreed, that Won's consent was coerced because it was obtained by
threat of criminal prosecution.  Id. at 347, 372 P.3d at 1082. 
In the instant case, to the contrary, Stone was informed that
there were both civil and criminal sanctions if he did not submit
to a BAC, but Stone did not consent to the BAC.  Thus, the main
issue present in Won - coerced consent - is not present in this
case. 
Stone also refers to Wilson to support his argument
that his driver's license revocation should be overturned. 
Wilson was arrested for Driving Under the Influence (DUI ).  92
Hawai#i at 46, 987 P.2d at 269.  Wilson was informed by the
arresting officer that someone who consented to a blood alcohol
test and failed would only have their driver's license revoked
for three months, when in fact they could have their license
revoked from three months up to a year.  Id. at 51, 987 P.2d at
274.  Wilson consented to a blood alcohol test, failed, and was
charged by criminal complaint with DUI.  Id. at 46, 52, 987 P.2d
at 269, 275.  Wilson moved to suppress the results of the blood
test, the motion was granted, and the State appealed.  Id. at 46-
48, 987 P.2d at 269-71. 
The Supreme Court held that because the information
provided to Wilson was "inaccurate and misleading," Wilson did
not make a "knowing and intelligent decision whether or not to
submit to the evidentiary blood alcohol test[.]"  Id. at 46, 987
P.2d at 269.  Consequently, the Court held that the "violation of
HRS chapter 286's consent requirement precludes admissibility of 
6NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Wilson's blood test results in his related criminal DUI
proceeding."  Id. at 53-54, 987 P.2d at 276-77.
Stone cites to Wilson to support his argument that
civil and criminal OVUII sanctions are so closely tied to one
another that Won should be extended to overturn his civil
revocation.  Indeed, the Supreme Court in Wilson does state that
the civil revocation process and criminal prosecution for DUI are
"inextricably related[.]"  Id. at 52, 987 P.2d at 275.  However,
this was used to explain how evidence, obtained after a driver is
provided with inaccurate information on civil sanctions which
then leads to a criminal DUI conviction, can be suppressed.  Id. 
This was not meant to extend cases like Won.  Won was decided
after Wilson and, as noted, Won explicitly states that its
holding does not apply to civil revocation proceedings.  Thus,
Stone's first point of error is without merit.
B.  Electronic Signatures on Police Reports
Stone argues in his second point of error that because
there were only electronic signatures on the police incident
reports, instead of handwritten signatures, the reports were not
"sworn" to and thus are invalid.  
Statutes pertaining to the driver's license revocation
process require sworn statements.  See HRS §§ 291E-36(b) (2007);
-37(c)(3) (2007); -38(g) (Supp. 2012); see also McGrail v. Admin.
Dir. of Courts, State, 130 Hawai# i 74, 79–80, 305 P.3d 490,
495–96 (App. 2013); Kernan, 75 Haw. 1, 856 P.2d 1207.  In Kernan,
referring to HRS § 286-257  regarding sworn statements for the
administrative revocation of driver's licenses, the Court
explained:3
[t]he statute requires sworn statements, not statements
given under oath or even notarized statements.  The lack of
statutory language creating these additional requirements
raises a presumption that a statement sworn to by the
officer is sufficient.  The three statements submitted in
each of the Appellants' cases bore the signature of that
3  This statute has since been repealed.  2000 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 189,
§ 29 at 432.  It required sworn statements from the arresting officer, the
person responsible for maintaining the breath testing equipment, and the
person who conducted the test.   Although different statutes apply in this
case, the issue of a "sworn statement" is similar. 
7NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
person and the statement, "I, (officer's name), swear that
the following is true and correct."  The statute requires
nothing more.
Id. at 32, 856 P.2d at 1223 (emphasis added).
In the instant case, the police reports have the
following statements: "[t]his report was prepared, signed,
reviewed, submitted, and filed electronically via secure network
in accord with Honolulu Police Department policy," and "I [name
of officer], [p]olice [o]fficer, swear that the above facts are
true and correct."  (Emphasis added).  The reports also have: the
name of the police officer who wrote the report, the police
officer's ID number, and the date and time the report was
submitted. 
The ADLRO Order, which was affirmed by the District
Court, determined that the electronic signatures of the police
officers have the same authority and validity as handwritten
signatures and were thus valid under HRS Chapter 489E,
particularly HRS § 489E-18.
Stone argues that the statutory provisions and
legislative history indicate that Chapter 489E applies to
"commercial transactions."  He thus asserts that the use of
electronic signatures in ADLRO proceedings are invalid and the
police incident reports are not "sworn" to as required for such
proceedings.  We disagree.
Questions of statutory interpretation are questions of law
reviewed de novo.
In our review of questions of statutory interpretation, this
court follows certain well-established principles, as
follows:  
First, the fundamental starting point for
statutory interpretation is the language of the
statute itself. Second, where the statutory
language is plain and unambiguous, our sole duty
is to give effect to its plain and obvious
meaning.  Third, implicit in the task of
statutory construction is our foremost
obligation to ascertain and give effect to the
intention of the legislature, which is to be
obtained primarily from the language contained
in the statute itself.  Fourth, when there is
doubt, doubleness of meaning, or
indistinctiveness or uncertainty of an
expression used in a statute, an ambiguity
exists.  And fifth, in construing an ambiguous
8NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
statute, the meaning of the ambiguous words may
be sought by examining the context, with which
the ambiguous words, phrases, and sentences may
be compared, in order to ascertain their true
meaning.
State v. Silver, 125 Hawai#i 1, 4, 249 P.3d 1141, 1144 (2011)
(citations omitted).
In this case, the applicable provisions of HRS chapter
489E, entitled the "Uniform Electronic Transactions Act" ( UETA),
are plain and unambiguous.  HRS § 489E-3 (2008) addresses the
scope of Chapter 489E and provides that the UETA applies to
"electronic records and electronic signatures relating to a
transaction."  HRS § 489E-3(a).  In turn, "[t]ransaction" is
defined as "an action or set of actions occurring between two or
more persons relating to the conduct of business, commercial, or
governmental affairs."  HRS § 489E-2 (2008) (emphasis added). 
Moreover, HRS § 489E-18 (2008) specifically addresses the use of
electronic signatures by governmental agencies:
[§489E-18]  Acceptance and distribution of electronic
records by governmental agencies.   (a) Except as otherwise
provided in section 489E-12(f), each governmental agency of this
State shall determine whether, and the extent to which, it will
send and accept electronic records and electronic signatures to
and from other persons and otherwise create, generate,
communicate, store, process, use, and rely upon electronic records
and electronic signatures.
The language in HRS § 489E-18 is clear that it is
within the discretion of a governmental agency to determine
whether and in what capacity the agency will use electronic
signatures.  Thus, Stone's argument that the UETA applies to
commercial transactions and thus cannot apply to police reports
is without merit.
The ADLRO Decision stated, and it is undisputed, that
in accordance with HRS § 489E-18, the HPD promulgated its Policy
Number 8.06, which provides:
[a]n electronic signature that is automatically generated by a
computer for a specific officer shall have the authority and
validity of the officer's handwritten signature.  The electronic
signature shall consist of the officer's entire first and last
names and six-digit identification number.  The definition,
application, and attribution of electronic signatures shall be in
accordance with chapter 489E of the Hawaii Revised Statutes.   
9NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
The ADLRO Decision further stated, and it is
undisputed, that the ADLRO promulgated its own policy to accept
electronic signatures from the HPD.  This was done via a letter
from the ADLRO Chief Adjudicator to the HPD Chief of Police in
November 2006.  Stone argues in cursory fashion that the letter
by the ADLRO Chief Adjudicator was not authorized or approved by
the Administrative Director of the Courts.  However, Stone does
not point to anything in the record to support his claim. 
Moreover, HRS § 291E-1 (2007) defines "Director" as "the
administrative director of the courts or any other person within
the judiciary appointed by the director to conduct administrative
reviews or hearings or carry out other functions relating to
administrative revocation under part III."  (Emphasis added). 
Thus, Stone fails to demonstrate that the ADLRO Decision was
incorrect.
In sum, therefore, the electronic signatures on the
police reports in the instant case are valid, and Stone's second
point of error is without merit.
III.  Conclusion
Based on the above, the "Decision and Order Affirming
Administrative Revocation" entered by the District Court of the
First Circuit on April 19, 2016, is affirmed.
