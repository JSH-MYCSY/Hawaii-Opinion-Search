NO. CAAP-16-0000407 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
 
MARK BIGGERS, Defendant-Appellee.
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 15-1-1557)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant State of Hawai 'i (State) charged 
Defendant-Appellee Mark Biggers (Biggers) with two counts of
 
second-degree burglary, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes
 (HRS) § 708-811 (2014).
1/  Biggers' burglary charges were based
 
1/ HRS § 708-811 provides, in relevant part:
 
(1) A person commits the offense of burglary in the second
degree if the person intentionally enters or remains unlawfully in
a building with intent to commit therein a crime against a person
or against property rights.
 
HRS § 708-800 (2014), in turn, defines the phrase "enter or remain
unlawfully," in relevant part, as follows:
 
"Enter or remain unlawfully" means to enter or remain in or
upon premises when the person is not licensed, invited, or
otherwise privileged to do so. A person who, regardless of the
person's intent, enters or remains in or upon premises which are
at the time open to the public does so with license and privilege
unless the person defies a lawful order not to enter or remain,
personally communicated to the person by the owner of the premises
or some other authorized person.

on his violation of a trespass warning previously issued by
 
Seven-Eleven Stores pursuant to HRS § 708-814(1)(b) (2014).
 
The State appeals from the "Findings of Fact,
 
Conclusions of Law, and Order Granting Motion to Dismiss Felony
 Information as a Matter of Law" (Dismissal Order) entered by the
 
2/
Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court)  on April 19,
2016. 
The relevant circumstances of this case are 
indistinguishable from those in the Hawai 'i Supreme Court's 
recent decision in State v. King, 139 Hawai 'i 249, 386 P.3d 886 
(2016). In King, the supreme court held that the violation of a trespass warning "issued pursuant to HRS § 708–814(1)(b) is not a 'defi[ance] of a lawful order' under HRS § 708–800," and therefore, the violation of a trespass warning "cannot be made a vehicle for a second-degree burglary charge under HRS § 708–811." Id. at 257, 386 P.3d at 894 (brackets in original). Based on King, we affirm the Dismissal Order.
