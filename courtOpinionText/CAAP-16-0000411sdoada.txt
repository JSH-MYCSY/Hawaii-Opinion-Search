APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(FC-D NO. 14-1-0182)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Ginoza, C.J., and Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
This case arises out of a complaint for divorce, filed
 
by Plaintiff-Appellant/Cross-Appellee Ethel Yuko Matsuno ("EM")
 
against Defendant-Appellee/Cross-Appellee Rex Yoshio Matsuno
 ("RM"). The case is rife with procedural complexities involving
 EM's alleged motives in pursuing the divorce, RM's capacity,
 bifurcation of the divorce proceedings, the existence and
 validity of a premarital agreement between RM and EM, and the
 purported interests in the divorce action held by various related
 family businesses.
 
EM appeals from the Order Dismissing Action entered by 
the Family Court of the Third Circuit ("Family Court")
1 on May 3, 
2016. Applicants-in-Intervention-Appellees/Cross -Appellants Suisan Group, Inc., Suisan Company, Limited, Suisan Properties, Limited, and Matsuno Enterprises, Ltd., all Hawai' i corporations 
1/ The Honorable Lloyd Van De Car presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
(collectively, the "Suisan Entities"), cross-appeal from the
 
Order Denying Suisan Entities' Motion to Intervene, entered by
 the Family Court on March 21, 2016 ("Order Denying Motion to
 Intervene").
2
 
On appeal, EM contends that the Family Court erred in
 
dismissing the case on the basis of the parties' failure to set
 the case for trial within nine months, denying her first and
 second motions to bifurcate, and denying her motion for summary
 judgment as to the enforceability of the parties' premarital
 agreement. The Suisan Entities, on the other hand, contend that
 the Family Court erred in denying their motion to intervene.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments they advance and the issues they raise, and taking
 into account the suggestion of RM's death, we affirm both the
 Order Dismissing Action and the Order Denying Motion to
 Intervene.
 
On June 26, 2014, EM filed a Complaint for Divorce in
 
the Family Court ("Complaint"), alleging that her marriage to RM
 was "irretrievably broken." RM subsequently filed an amended
 answer to the Complaint on April 18, 2016, denying that the
 marriage was irretrievably broken.
 
On February 12, 2016, nearly two years after the 
Complaint was filed and after numerous motions were filed, including two motions to bifurcate, a motion for summary judgment, and a motion to intervene, the Family Court filed a Notice of Intent to Dismiss the action because "[n]either party has filed a Motion to Set nor sought an extension from the Court of the Hawai' i Family Court Rule 94
3 filing deadline for that 
motion." 
2/ We deem the Suisan Entities' cross-appeal from the May 3, 2016
Order Dismissing Action to seek review of the March 21, 2016 Order Denying
Motion to Intervene.
 
3/ Hawai'i Family Court Rules ("HFCR") Rule 94 provides that "either
party may at any time file a motion to set the case for trial. Such a motion 
shall be filed no later than 9 months after a complaint has been filed or 
within any further period of extension granted by the court upon motion or
stipulation of the parties." Haw. Fam. Ct. R. 94 (emphasis added).

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
On May 3, 2016, the Family Court entered the Order
 
Dismissing Action. On May 18, 2016, EM timely filed the Notice
 
of appeal. On May 27, 2016, the Suisan Entities filed a timely
 Notice of Cross-Appeal. On February 28, 2018, RM's counsel filed
 a declaration regarding the death of RM, advising that RM passed
 away on November 30, 2017, and a Notice of Suggestion of Death. 
The underlying divorce action has been extinguished
4
 
by the death of RM and thus, we affirm the Order Dismissing
 Action. We have adopted the common law rule that an action for
 divorce is a purely personal matter which extinguishes upon the
 death of either party. See Camp, 109 Hawaii at 469, 128 P.3d at
 
351 (holding that party's death prior to entry of formal divorce
 decree extinguished divorce action and family court's
 jurisdiction to enter divorce decree). Similarly, "[t]he general
 rule applied in cases involving [death during an appeal from a
 judgment or decree of divorce] is that the action abates with
 respect to the issue of the marital status of the parties but not
 with respect to the determination of property interests which may
 be affected by the divorce." Francis M. Dougherty, Annotation,
 Effect of Death of Party to Divorce Proceeding Pending Appeal or
 Time Allowed for Appeal, 33 A.L.R.4th 47 § 2[a] (1984).
 
Here, EM appeals from the Order Dismissing Action, a
 
ruling by the Family Court that does not involve the
 determination of property rights.
5 Accordingly, we affirm the
 
4/ "We use the word extinguished rather than the word abated because
extinguished is the word used in [HFCR] Rule 25 (2005) which pertains to the
subject of the substitution of parties."  Camp v. Camp , 109 Hawai 'i 469, 469
n.2, 128 P.3d 351, 351 n.2 (App. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
5/ The general rule that a divorce action is extinguished when a
party to the action dies in the pendency of an appeal of a judgment or decree
that does not determine property rights has been repeatedly recognized and
upheld.  See, e.g. , Bell v. Bell , 181 U.S. 175, 178 (1901) (holding that death
of party in pendency of appeal of divorce decree abates the divorce action
where "nothing more had been involved in the judgment" other than termination
of marriage);  Owen v. Owen , 184 S.W.2d 808, 809 (Ark. 1945) (recognizing
"[w]here the party seeking a divorce appeals from a judgment, simply denying
it, and pending the appeal either party dies, the appeal and action abate
absolutely and cannot be revived, there being no one living who can legally
have any interest in the same." (quoting Bradshaw v. Sullivan , 254 S.W. 1064,
1065 (1923) (internal quotation marks omitted));  Angelli v. Sherway , 560 A.2d
1028, 1030 (Del. 1989) (concluding that "the death of an appellant who seeks
review of a denial of a divorce serves to abate any proceeding requiring a
remand . . . since there is no longer any underlying marital relationship to
be terminated"); Barnes v. Barnes , 15 P.3d 816, 819-20 (Idaho 2000)
(continued...)

Order Dismissing Action, entered by the Family Court on May 3,
 
2016. We need not address the parties' remaining points of
 error, as the extinguishment of the divorce action renders them
 moot. Thus, we similarly affirm the Order Denying the Motion to
 Intervene entered by the Family Court on March 21, 2016.

(recognizing "clear precedent in Idaho that where a party to a divorce dies
during the pendency of the appeal, the appeal abates" absent an express issue
of property rights); Bunger v. Bunger , 160 P. 976, 976 (Kan. 1916) (holding

abated divorce action); Arceneaux v. Arceneaux , 94 So.2d 449, 450 (La. 1957)

(holding that since divorce decree appealed from did not prejudice any
parties' rights to property, divorce action was abated by party's death).
