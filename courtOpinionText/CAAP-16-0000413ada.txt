OPINION OF THE COURT BY LEONARD, J.
Plaintiff-Appellant State of Hawai #i (State) appeals
from the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Granting
Defendant-[Appellee] Laura Pitolo's (Pitolo ) Motion to Dismiss
Felony Information With Prejudice ( Dismissal Order ), filed on
April 25, 2016, in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
(Circuit Court).1
1The Honorable Rom A. Trader presided.FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
We hold, inter alia , that:  (1) the State properly
exercised its prosecutorial discretion in charging Pitolo with
multiple offenses, even though several of the offenses were
charged as similar continuing-course-of-conduct crimes and the
charges overlapped in time; (2) each count of a felony
information constitutes a separate offense for the purpose of
determining "the earliest date of the discovery of the offense"
for the purpose of determining the extended statute of
limitations pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS ) § 701-
108(3)(a); (3) to the extent that the Circuit Court, in effect,
treated all six counts charged against Pitolo as a single
"offense" for the purpose of determining "the earliest date of
the discovery of the offense" in its application of HRS § 701-
108(3)(a), it erred in doing so; and (4) while it is permissible
to charge and prove an offense covering any part of the time span
of a continuing crime, and the State was free to do so in this
case, it is not permissible to disregard discovered conduct that
is (a) indisputably part of the continuing course of conduct, as
charged, and (b) that occurred within the charged period, in
order to avoid the running of the statute of limitations.  We
affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand.
I.BACKGROUND
The Wai#anae Community Outreach ( WCO) is a not-for-
profit community organization that provides services to the
homeless population on the leeward coast of O #ahu.  WCO relies,
in significant part, on funding from the State through the
Department of Human Services ( DHS).  Pitolo was employed at WCO
2FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
as a program manager until she left the organization in May of
2010.
On August 7, 2010, then WCO Executive Director Sophina
Placencia ( Placencia ) filed a police report with the Honolulu
Police Department ( HPD).  HPD Officer Robert King reported that
during his interview with Placencia, Placencia relayed to him
that, on May 27, 2010, she discovered evidence of theft from a
WCO bank account after Pitolo abruptly quit her job.  Placencia
explained that she discovered a number of suspicious checks when
reviewing the WCO's bank account records.  Some of the checks
were made out to "cash," others were made out to Pitolo's father,
Pulouoleola Salausa (Salausa  or Pitolo's Father), and some were
written to Pitolo herself.  Although Pitolo was authorized to
write checks, both Placencia and Pitolo were required to sign
them; only Pitolo had signed the suspicious checks.  Pitolo did
not have permission to write checks to herself.  Placencia
further reported that between May 27, 2010, and July 7, 2010,
Pitolo had written eight additional checks from three of WCO's
bank accounts.2  Attached to the police report, along with
Placencia's handwritten statement, there was also a withdrawal
slip for $1,134.00 from a WCO Bank of Hawai# i account, dated June
16, 2010, which was signed by Pitolo.
HPD Detective Greg Bentosino filed a report, last
updated on December 30, 2010, which shows that on August 16,
2Placencia related that upon Pitolo leaving the WCO, Placencia
attempted to convene WCO's board of directors to have Pitolo removed from the
authorized signers card with the Bank of Hawai #i, but the meeting could not be
held until July 7, 2010, at which time the board removed Pitolo from the
authorized signers card.  
3FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2010, Placencia supplemented the original police report by
reporting another twenty-nine unauthorized transactions from a
WCO American Savings Bank account that allegedly occurred between
September 4, 2009, and February 25, 2010, which brought the total
number of unauthorized checks reported to HPD to thirty-seven. 
The checks were written out to Pitolo, Jamye Windsor (a co-
worker) ( Windsor), WCO, Salausa, Leipaoa Salausa (Pitolo's
Sister), and "Cash."  Detective Bentosino's report noted that
"[a]ttempts to contact Leipaoa Salausa, Pulouoleola Salausa, and
Pitolo to schedule interviews with them have been unsuccessful." 
HPD took no further investigative action.
On July 25, 2013, WCO filed a civil complaint
(Complaint ) against Pitolo in the Circuit Court (Civil No. 13-1-
2050-07), alleging that Pitolo had converted approximately
$762,046.25 of WCO's monies for Pitolo's own use through cash
withdrawals, debit purchases using WCO's debit card, and checks
written to herself and to family members and friends.  In the
Complaint, WCO alleged that between 2007 and 2010, Pitolo issued
monies through unauthorized checks totaling $60,844.60 to
Windsor, $169,215.00 to Pitolo's Father, and $141,190.87 to
herself.  The Complaint further alleged that Pitolo made
unauthorized cash withdrawals totaling $390,795.78.
On September 5, 2013, after WCO filed the Complaint
against Pitolo, the DHS began an investigation and an audit of
WCO.  On November 13, 2013, after the allegations against Pitolo
became publicized through news broadcasts, the Office of the
Attorney General (AG ) began an investigation into the financial
4FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
practices of WCO; Chief Special Agent Daniel Hanagami was
assigned to conduct the AG investigation.  The AG investigation
took over the DHS investigation and all records and documents in
the possession of the DHS were turned over to the AG.  During its
investigation, the AG located numerous additional alleged
unauthorized transactions, which had not been specified in the
original police report or the supplement filed by Placencia in
2010.
On March 17, 2015, the State charged Pitolo by Felony
Information with five counts of Theft in the First Degree, in
violation of HRS §§ 708-830(2) (2014)3 and 708-830.5(1)(a)
(2014),4 as follows:
COUNT 1:  On or between February 13, 2009 and July 16,
2010, in a continuing course of conduct, in the City and
County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, [PITOLO] did obtain or
exert control over the property of the [STATE] and/or [WCO]
by deception, with intent to deprive the [STATE] and/or
[WCO] of the property, by writing unauthorized checks to
[WINDSOR], the value of which exceeded $20,000, thereby
committing the offense of THEFT IN THE FIRST DEGREE in
violation of Sections 708-830(2) & 708-830.5(1)(a), [HRS].
The State further alleges that the earliest date of
the discovery of the offense by the [State] or by a person
3HRS § 708-830 provides, in relevant part:
§ 708-830  Theft.   A person commits theft if the
person does any of the following: 
. . . .
(2) Property obtained or control exerted through
deception. A person obtains, or exerts control
over, the property of another by deception with
intent to deprive the other of the property.
4HRS § 708-830.5 provides, in relevant part:
§ 708-830.5  Theft in the first degree.   (1) A person
commits the offense of theft in the first degree if the
person commits theft: 
(a) Of property or services, the value of which
exceeds $20,000;
. . . .
(2) Theft in the first degree is a class B felony.

who has a legal duty to represent the [State] and who was
not a party to the offense was after September 5, 2013.
COUNT 2:  On or between December 8, 2008, and April
16, 2010, in a continuing course of conduct, in the City and
County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, [PITOLO] did obtain or
exert control over the property of the [STATE] and/or [WCO]
by deception, with intent to deprive the [STATE] and/or
[WCO] of the property, by writing unauthorized checks to
[PITOLO'S FATHER], the value of which exceeded $20,000,
thereby committing the offense of THEFT IN THE FIRST DEGREE
in violation of Sections 708-830(2) & 708-830.5(1)(a),
[HRS].
The State further alleges that the earliest date of
the discovery of the offense by the [State] or by a person
who has a legal duty to represent the [State] and who was
not a party to the offense was after September 5, 2013.
COUNT 3:  On or between March 16, 2007, and July 6,
2010, in a continuing course of conduct, in the City and
County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, [PITOLO] did obtain or
exert control over the property of the [STATE] and/or [WCO]
by deception, with intent to deprive the [STATE] and/or
[WCO] of the property, by writing unauthorized checks to
herself, the value of which exceeded $20,000, thereby
committing the offense of THEFT IN THE FIRST DEGREE in
violation of Sections 708- 830(2) & 708-830.5(1 )(a), [HRS].
The State further alleges that the earliest date of
the discovery of the offense by the [State] or by a person
who has a legal duty to represent the [State] and who was
not a party to the offense was after September 5, 2013.
COUNT 4:  On or between December 27, 2007, and May 26,
2010, in a continuing course of conduct, in the City and
County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, [PITOLO] did obtain or
exert control over the property of the [STATE] and/or [WCO]
by deception, with intent to deprive the [STATE] and/or
[WCO] of the property, by making unauthorized ATM cash
withdrawals, the value of which exceeded $20,000, thereby
committing the offense of THEFT IN THE FIRST DEGREE in
violation of Sections 708-830(2) & 708-830.5(1)(a), [HRS].
The State further alleges that the earliest date of
the discovery of the offense by the [State] or by a person
who has a legal duty to represent the [State] and who was
not a party to the offense was after September 5, 2013.
COUNT 5:  On or between January 14, 2008, and June 2,
2009, in a continuing course of conduct, in the City and
County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, [PITOLO] did obtain or
exert control over the property of the [STATE] and/or [WCO]
by deception, with intent to deprive the [STATE] and/or
[WCO] of the property, by making unauthorized debit
transactions, the value of which exceeded $20,000, thereby
committing the offense of THEFT IN THE FIRST DEGREE in
violation of Sections 708-830(2) & 708-830.5(1 )(a), [HRS].
The State further alleges that the earliest date of
the discovery of the offense by the [State] or by a person
who has a legal duty to represent the [State] and who was
not a party to the offense was after September 5, 2013.
6FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
The Felony Information also charged Pitolo with one
count of Theft in the Second Degree, in violation of HRS §§ 708-
830(2) and 708-831(1)(b) (2014),5 as follows:
COUNT 6:  On or about May 10, 2010, in the City and
County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, [PITOLO] did obtain or
exert control over the property of the [STATE] and/or [WCO]
by deception, with intent to deprive the [STATE] and/or
[WCO] of the property, by writing an unauthorized check to
YOUNG HO SIM, the value of which exceeded $300, thereby
committing the offense of THEFT IN THE SECOND DEGREE in
violation of Sections 708-830(2) & 708-831(1)(b), [HRS].
The State further alleges that the earliest date of
the discovery of the offense by the [State] or by a person
who has a legal duty to represent the [State] and who was
not a party to the offense was after September 5, 2013.
On January 12, 2016, Pitolo filed the Motion to Dismiss
Felony Information With Prejudice ( Motion to Dismiss) pursuant
to, inter alia , HRS §§ 701-108, 701-114, 806-34, and 806-86, and
Hawai#i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 12.  The Motion to
Dismiss was based on "the State's failure to comply with the
Statute of Limitations," "the untimely filing of criminal charges
against the Defendant," and "the State's failure to accurately
state the date of the earliest discovery of the alleged offenses
in the Felony Information filed on March 17, 2015."   The motion
was supported by a Declaration of Counsel and a Memorandum of Law
5At the time of the alleged offense, HRS § 708-831 provided, in
relevant part:
§ 708-831  Theft in the second degree.  (1) A person
commits the offense of theft in the second degree if the
person commits theft:
 . . . .
(b) Of property or services the value of which
exceeds $300;
. . . .
(2) Theft in the second degree is a class C
felony. . . .
Subsequently, HRS § 708-831(b) was amended (in 2016), to increase the
threshold from $300 to $750.
7FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
contending that the "date of discovery," for the purpose of
calculating the expiration of the statute of limitations in this
case under HRS §§ 701-108 (2)(d) and 701-108 (3)(a) (2014), was
May 2010.  Attached to the Motion to Dismiss as exhibits were the
Placencia police reports, along with the civil complaint filed
against Pitolo by WCO.
In the State's response to the Motion to Dismiss, the
State conceded that thirty-seven transactions were discovered in
2010 and that HRS § 701-108 bars the State from prosecuting those
transactions.  The State asserted, however, that although fifteen
of the previously discovered thirty-seven transactions were
associated with Counts 1, 2, and 3, those particular transactions
were not charged in the Felony Information, as stated in the
sealed affidavit supporting the Felony Information.  The State
contended that these other transactions were not discovered until
after September 5, 2013.
On March 22, 2016, the Circuit Court held a hearing on
the Motion to Dismiss and, after the arguments of counsel,
announced its ruling.  Essentially, the court concluded that the
earliest date of discovery of a criminal scheme by an aggrieved
party was May 27, 2010, and certainly no later than August 7,
2010, and that the Felony Information was filed beyond the
applicable statute of limitations.
On April 25, 2016, the Circuit Court entered the
Dismissal Order concluding, inter alia, that the applicable
statute of limitations in this case is governed by HRS §§ 701-
8FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
108(2)(d) and 701-108(3)(a).  The Circuit Court's Conclusions of
Law (COLs) also stated:
2. The applicable discovery date of the alleged thefts is
either May 27, 2010 but no later than August 7, 2010.
Therefore, the applicable statute of limitations
expired on either May 27, 2013 or August 7, 2013.
3. Both the [WCO] and the [State] are aggrieved parties
for purposes of the extension of time allowed for
purposes of calculating the applicable statute of
limitations under [HRS] Section 701-108(3)(a).
4. The court concludes that the discovery of the offense
refers to the criminal scheme in this case, as opposed
to the individual transactions or specific individual
criminal acts alleged, and is governed by [HRS]
Section 701-108(3)(a).
5. The statute of limitations begins when either the
aggrieved party or a person who has a duty to
represent the aggrieved party and was not a party to
the offense discovers the criminal scheme.  State v.
Stan's Contracting, Inc. , 111 Hawaii 17, 35 (2006). 
6. The alleged conduct that serves as the basis for all 6
Counts of the Felony Information filed in the instant
case constitute one criminal scheme.
 7. 
The Felony Information filed on March 17, 2015 in the
instant case was filed beyond the applicable statute
of limitations. 
On May 20, 2016, the State filed its Notice of Appeal.
II.POINTS OF ERROR
On appeal, the State raises two points of error,
contending that the Circuit Court erred:  (1) in concluding that
the applicable statute of limitations expired on either May 27,
2013, or August 7, 2013; and (2) in concluding that the alleged
conduct that served as the basis for the Felony Information
constituted a single criminal scheme.  In conjunction with its
second point of error, the State argues that even if the
prosecution of Counts 1, 2, and 3 was untimely, the Circuit Court
erred in dismissing Counts 4, 5, and 6.
9FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
III.APPLICABLE STANDARD OF REVIEW
An appellate court may freely review conclusions of law
and the applicable standard of review is the right/wrong test.
State v. Stan's Contracting, Inc., 111 Hawai #i 17, 23, 137 P.3d
331, 337 (2006).  Therefore, a conclusion of law that is
supported by the trial court's findings of fact and that reflects
an application of the correct rule of law will not be overturned.
Id.
IV.DISCUSSION
A.The Statute of Limitations
The State argues that the Circuit Court erred when it
concluded that the applicable statute of limitations for all of
the charges against Pitolo expired on either May 27, 2013, when
Placencia, as Executive Director of WCO, discovered Pitolo's
alleged criminal offenses, or August 7, 2013, when the police
were informed of some of Pitolo's alleged criminal offenses.  The
State submits that, under the circumstances of this case, the
Circuit Court should have concluded that the earliest date that
the charged offenses could have been discovered was after
September 5, 2013, when the DHS began its investigation.  On this
basis, the State argues, the Circuit Court should have concluded
that the March 17, 2015 commencement of the prosecution of Pitolo
was timely.
10FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
1.HRS § 701-108
The applicable statute of limitations is set forth in
HRS § 701-108 (2014), as follows:6
HRS § 701-108  Time Limitations.   (1) A prosecution
for murder . . .
(2) Except as otherwise provided in this section,
prosecutions for other offenses are subject to the following
periods of limitation:
(a) A prosecution for manslaughter . . . 
(b) A prosecution for a class A felony . . .
(c) A prosecution for any felony under part IX of
chapter 708 . . .
(d) A prosecution for any other felony must be
commenced within three years after it is
committed;
. . . . 
(3) If the period prescribed in subsection (2) has
expired, a prosecution may nevertheless be commenced for:
(a) Any offense an element of which is either fraud,
deception, as defined in section 708-800, or a
breach of fiduciary obligation within three
years after discovery of the offense by an
aggrieved party or by a person who has a legal
duty to represent an aggrieved party and who is
oneself not a party to the offense, but in no
case shall this provision extend the period of
limitation by more than six years from the
expiration of the period of limitation
prescribed in subsection (2);
. . . .
(4) An offense is committed either when every
element occurs, or, if a legislative purpose to prohibit a
continuing course of conduct plainly appears, at the time
when the course of conduct or the defendant's complicity
therein is terminated.  Time starts to run on the day after
the offense is committed.
Therefore, pursuant to HRS § 701-108(2)(d), a
prosecution for first degree theft by deception generally must be
commenced within three years after the offense is committed. 
However, pursuant to HRS § 701-108(3)(a), even if the three-year
6In 2016, HRS § 701-108(3)(a) was amended to add reference to the
offense of medical assistance fraud under section 346-43.5.  See HRS § 701-
108(3)(a) (Supp. 2016).
11FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
period has expired, a prosecution for first degree theft by
deception may nevertheless be commenced at a later date, based on
a delayed discovery of the "offense" by either (1) an aggrieved
party or (2) a person who has a legal duty to represent an
aggrieved party and who is oneself not a party to the offense.7 
If such discovery of the "offense" is delayed, then the statute
of limitations may be extended to as much as three years after
the discovery, so long as the prosecution is commenced no later
than six years after the date that the offense is committed. 
Finally, pursuant to HRS § 701-108(4), "an offense" is
"committed" either "when every element occurs" or, in the case of
a statute intended to prohibit a continuing course of conduct,
when "the course of conduct . . . is terminated."  Here, Counts
1-5 of the Felony Information each charge a continuing-course-of-
conduct offense of first degree theft by deception.8  It is well-
established that first degree theft can constitute a continuing
offense.  See State v. Martin , 62 Haw. 364, 371, 616 P.2d 193,
198 (1980).  In Martin, the Hawai #i Supreme Court held that the
defendant committed a continuing offense because, where the
defendant periodically filed identical, fraudulent public
assistance forms over a six-year period in order to receive
welfare payments, each fraudulent transaction was the
continuation of a single and uninterrupted criminal impulse.  Id. 
7As neither party contends that the "who is not a party to the
offense" clause is at issue in this case, the second potential discoverer is
simply referred to hereinafter as "a person who has a legal duty to represent
an aggrieved party."  This shortened reference should not be read to
substantively change this alternative.
8Count 6 does not charge a continuing course of conduct.
12FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
at 369, 616 P.2d at 197.  Consistent with HRS § 701-108(4), the
supreme court further held that "the date of the most recent act
of a continuing offense governs the application of the statute of
limitations."  Id. at 372, 616 P.2d at 198.
Here, Pitolo argued, and the Circuit Court concluded,
that the term "offense" in HRS § 701-108(3)(a) & (4) "refers to
the criminal scheme in this case, as opposed to the individual
transactions or specific individual criminal acts alleged," based
on the supreme court's opinion in Stan's Contracting.  The
Circuit Court further concluded, presumably relying on Stan's
Contracting , that the conduct alleged in all six counts of the
Felony Information constituted a single criminal scheme that was
discovered in 2010.  On that basis, the court dismissed the
entire March 17, 2015 Felony Information on the grounds that it
was not filed within the statute of limitations.
2.Stan's Contracting
The State argues that the Circuit Court erroneously
relied on Stan's Contracting to determine that:  (1) discovery of
a criminal scheme triggers the HRS § 701-108 statute of
limitations for each offense that is or may be part of a common
criminal scheme; (2) the 2010 discovery of the thirty-seven
unauthorized checks, as reported to HPD, constituted the
discovery of Pitolo's scheme; (3) all of the criminal acts of
theft allegedly committed by Pitolo were part of a single
criminal scheme; and (4) therefore, the Felony Information was
filed beyond the three-year limitations period dating from the
discovery of the scheme and all of the offenses charged therein
13FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
must be dismissed.  Under the circumstances of this case, we
conclude that Stan's Contracting does not support these
determinations in their entirety.
Stan's Contracting involved an appeal from the
dismissal of a two-count indictment that charged the defendants,
referred to therein as "Stan's Contracting" and "Murphy
Construction," each with one count of theft by deception.  Stan's
Contracting, 111 Hawai# i at 18-19, 137 P.3d at 332-33.  An
employee of the State Department of Accounting and General
Services ( DAGS), Fidel Eviota II ( Eviota), apparently submitted
multiple invoices to DAGS for unperformed construction services. 
Id. at 19, 137 P.3d at 333.  Pertinent to the Stan's Contracting
case, Eviota allegedly funneled money through Stan's Contracting
and Murphy Construction, by way of two separate contracts, to
fund construction at various properties owned by Eviota.  Id. at
20, 137 P.3d at 334.  Charges against Stan's Contracting and
Murphy Construction9 were dismissed by the trial court (1) as
time-barred, on the theory that theft by deception does not
contain the element of fraud necessary to trigger the tolling
provision in HRS § 701-108(3)(a),10 and (2) as fatally defective
because the indictment failed to allege statute-of-limitations-
tolling facts.  Id. at 19, 137 P.3d at 333.  
9No charges against Eviota were involved in Stan's Contracting.
10At that time, HRS 701-108(3)(a) (Supp. 1997) only referred to
offenses containing elements of fraud or breach of fiduciary obligation. 
Crimes with deception as an element were expressly added effective May 15,
2006. See 2006 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 99, § 1. 
14FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
With regard to the first issue on appeal in Stan's
Contracting, the supreme court held that theft by deception
constitutes a form of fraud and therefore qualified for the
tolling provision in HRS § 701-108(3)(a).  Id. at 30, 137 P.3d at
344.  In doing so, the supreme court noted that "deception
represents a conduct element of HRS § 708-830(2) in that it is
the accused's deceptive conduct in securing the property that
gives rise to penal responsibility."  Id. 
As to the second issue raised in  Stan's Contracting ,
the supreme court held that "when the charged offense is theft by
deception, as defined by HRS § 708-830(2), and the prosecution is
relying on the tolling provision of HRS § 701-108(3)(a). . ., the
prosecution must not only allege the timely date or dates of
commission of the offense in the indictment, but also the
earliest date of the discovery of the offense by an aggrieved
party or a person who has a legal duty to represent [the]
aggrieved party."  Id. at 34, 137 P.3d at 348 (internal quotation
marks and original ellipsis omitted).11  In other words, the
11Here, in the Motion to Dismiss, Pitolo asserted that the State
failed to comply with the statute of limitations and that the State failed to
"accurately state the date of the earliest discovery of the alleged offenses."
(Emphasis added.)  Pitolo did not argue, and the Circuit Court did not find or
conclude, that the Felony Information failed to aver facts purporting to
establish the timeliness of the prosecution.  As set forth above, each count
of the Felony Information avers that Pitolo committed certain acts
constituting an offense of theft by deception as to the State and/or WCO and
further avers that the earliest date of discovery of the offense by the State
or by a person who has a legal duty to represent the State was after September
5, 2013.  In essense, Pitolo argued that evidence showing WCO's discovery in
May of 2010, the existence of which is acknowledged in the sealed probable
cause affidavit supporting the Felony Information, established May 2010 as the
earliest date of discovery of all of the charged offenses.

supreme court held that an indictment (or felony information)12
must include an averment of facts that, if proven at trial, would
establish that the extended statute of limitations had not
expired.  Id.  The indictment in Stan's Contracting failed to
aver such facts and therefore was insufficient.  Id. 
The court in Stan's Contracting continued its analysis,
however, recognizing that an insufficient indictment or count can
in some instances be cured by supplemental information provided
to the accused, possibly through an offer of proof.  Id.  at 34-
35, 137 P.3d at 348-49.  In this appeal, Pitolo relies heavily on
the Stan's Contracting  court's use of the word "scheme" in its
analysis of the adequacy of the prosecution's offer of proof,
arguing that the supreme court's use of the term "scheme" was
"intentional, necessary and significant" and that it
"specifically indicates that the discovery of the scheme, rather
than any single transaction, triggers the running of the SOL." 
As the Circuit Court here concluded that "the discovery of the
offense refers to the criminal scheme in this case, as opposed to
the individual transactions or specific individual criminal acts
alleged" and that "[the] alleged conduct that serves as the basis
for all 6 Counts . . . constitutes one criminal scheme," it
appears that the Circuit Court agreed with and adopted Pitolo's
contention.
12HRS § 806-9 (2014) provides:  "All provisions of law applying to
prosecutions upon indictments . . . shall in the same manner and to the same
extent as near as may be, apply to information and all prosecutions and
proceedings thereon."
16FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
The supreme court's use of the word "scheme" in this
context is as follows:
The indictment, however, is devoid of any facts
averring when the alleged involvement of the Appellees in
Eviota's scheme was first discovered and, therefore,
provides no facts that, if proven at trial, would establish
that the extended limitation period had not expired.  The
prosecution, at the July 26, 2002 hearing, attempted to cure
this deficiency through an offer of proof that Ho first
determined there was some criminal liability on the part of
the Appellees on February 14, 2000.  Under HRS
§ 701-108(3)(a), the period to indict would run until
February 14, 2003, and the State's prosecution would
therefore be timely inasmuch as it began on May 15, 2002.
However, under HRS § 701-108(3)(a), the extension
begins to run when  the aggrieved party  the personeither or
who has a legal duty to represent the aggrieved party
discovers the scheme .  The prosecution's 
offer of proof
established, at most, when Ho, as an agent of the Department
of the Attorney General, discovered the offense, not when
the aggrieved party itself, DAGS, learned of the scheme . 
Therefore, to cure the indictment, an affirmative offer of
proof was required that no representative of DAGS had
discovered the alleged involvement of the Appellees  prior to
May 15, 1999.  Absent such facts, the indictment did not
sufficiently allege that the prosecution was timely.

(quotation marks, brackets, and ellipses omitted; bold and
underline emphasis added).
We reject Pitolo's reliance on this passage for a
number of reasons.  First, reading the passage as a whole, it is
clear that the supreme court was referring to the discovery of
the defendants' involvement  or criminal conduct in Eviota's
scheme, not merely the discovery of Eviota's scheme.  Second, the
issue that the supreme court was addressing was that the
prosecutor's offer of proof only established when law enforcement
discovered the offense, rather than when it was discovered by
DAGS, the aggrieved party in  Stan's Contracting.  The court
appeared to use the terms "offense" and "scheme" interchangeably
in its discussion, without explicative purpose.  Indeed, under
17FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
the facts of Stan's Contracting, there was no reason to
distinguish between "the offense" and "the scheme."  There was
only a single count charged against each of the two defendants in
Stan's Contracting; in other words, the State only alleged that
each defendant engaged in a single criminal scheme, which scheme
constituted the single charged offense.  Unlike Pitolo, neither
Stan's Contracting defendant was charged with multiple counts
alleging multiple continuing-conduct offenses, with each count
allegedly involving a discrete, albeit similar or related,
offense.  Stan's Contracting simply does not hold (or support the
proposition) that if two or more offenses are of the same or
similar character, or are even part of a single criminal scheme
or plan, that the discovery of any offense, or any part of the
criminal scheme or plan, necessarily constitutes the "discovery
of the offense" for each and every offense charged, pursuant to
the tolling provision in HRS § 701-108(3)(a).  
3.The Offenses Charged By the State
We examine the offenses charged in the context of
Hawai#i's penal framework.  As discussed above, the extended-
statute-of-limitations period in HRS § 701-108(3)(a) begins to
run upon the earliest date of the "discovery of the offense " by
an aggrieved party or a person who has a legal duty to represent
the aggrieved party.  As stated in HRS § 701-102 (2014), no
behavior constitutes an offense unless made so by the Hawaii
Penal Code or another statute; in other words, an offense is that
which is proscribed in the Hawaii Penal Code or another statute. 
An offense may constitute a crime or a violation.  HRS § 701-102
18FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(2014).  With certain exceptions, a person may not be found
guilty of an offense unless the person acted with the requisite
state of mind with respect to each element of the offense.  HRS
§ 702-204 (2014).  HRS § 702-205 (2014) states:
§ 702-205  Elements of an offense.   The elements of an
offense are such (1) conduct, (2) attendant circumstances,
and (3) results of conduct, as:
(a) Are specified by the definition of the offense,
and
(b) Negative a defense (other than a defense based
on the statute of limitations, lack of venue, or
lack of jurisdiction).
The statutory provisions governing criminal procedure
in the Circuit Courts, including the procedures for information
charging, provide that "'the offense' means the specific offense
constituted by the acts or omissions of the accused as
distinguished from 'the transaction' which means the particular
acts, facts, and circumstances which distinguish the offense
committed from other offenses of the same nature."  HRS § 806-1
(2014).  Multiple offenses may be joined in one charge, with each
offense in a separate count, "when the offenses:  (1) are of the
same or similar character, even if not part of a single scheme or
plan; or (2) are based on the same conduct or on a series of acts
connected together or constituting parts of a single scheme or
plan."  HRPP Rule 8(a) (format altered).  A defendant may be
prosecuted  for multiple offenses arising from the same criminal
conduct, although the defendant may not be convicted  of multiple
offenses when he or she has only engaged in a single continuing
course of criminal conduct directed only at one criminal goal. 
19FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
See HRS § 701-109(1)(e) (2014).13  "This prohibition . . . does
not apply where these actions constitute separate offenses under
the law."  State v. Arceo , 84 Hawai #i 1, 21, 928 P.2d 843, 863
(1996).
The State has wide prosecutorial discretion, including
with respect to what charges will be filed, how many charges will
be filed, and how to frame and argue the issues in the case. 
See, e.g., State v. Radcliffe , 9 Haw. App. 628, 639-40, 859 P.2d
925, 932 (1993).  Here, the State exercised this discretion by
charging Pitolo with multiple offenses, in six separate counts,
which is clearly permitted under the statutory framework
highlighted above.  
In Count 1, the State averred, inter alia , that on or
between February 13, 2009, and July 16, 2010, in a continuing
course of conduct, Pitolo did obtain or exert control over the
property of the State and/or WCO by deception, with intent to
deprive the State and/or WCO of the property, by writing
unauthorized checks to Windsor.  In Count 2, the State averred,
inter alia , that on or between December 8, 2008, and April 16,
2010, in a continuing course of conduct, Pitolo did obtain or
exert control over the property of the State and/or WCO by
deception, with intent to deprive the State and/or WCO of the
property, by writing unauthorized checks to Salausa.  In Count 3,
13The determination of whether a defendant may be convicted of more
than one offense, based on "whether the evidence discloses one general intent
or discloses separate and distinct intents," is a question of fact that must
be decided by the trier-of-fact after trial.  See, e.g., State v. Matias, 102
Hawai#i 300, 305, 75 P.3d 1191, 1196 (2003).  Thus, the issue of whether the
six separate offenses charged against Pitolo merged was not subject to the
determination of the Circuit Court on Pitolo's Motion to Dismiss.
20FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
the State averred, inter alia , that on or between March 16, 2007,
and July 6, 2010, in a continuing course of conduct, Pitolo did
obtain or exert control over the property of the State and/or WCO
by deception, with intent to deprive the State and/or WCO of the
property, by writing unauthorized checks to herself.  In Count 4,
the State averred, inter alia, that on or between December 27,
2007, and May 26, 2010, in a continuing course of conduct, Pitolo
did obtain or exert control over the property of the State and/or
WCO by deception, with intent to deprive the State and/or WCO of
the property, by making unauthorized ATM cash withdrawals.  In
Count 5, the State averred, inter alia, that on or between
January 14, 2008, and June 2, 2009, in a continuing course of
conduct, Pitolo did obtain or exert control over the property of
the State and/or WCO by deception, with intent to deprive the
State and/or WCO of the property, by making unauthorized debit
transactions.  And, in Count 6, the State averred, inter alia ,
that on or about May 10, 2010, Pitolo did obtain or exert control
over the property of the State and/or WCO by deception, with
intent to deprive the State and/or WCO of the property, by
writing an unauthorized check to Young Ho Sim.
Thusly, the State charged that Pitolo engaged in
multiple offenses, each of which is allegedly made up of
particular criminal acts, facts, and circumstances supported by
different factual evidence, which purportedly distinguishes each
offense from the others, even though several of the offenses were
charged as similar continuing-course-of-conduct crimes and the
charges overlapped in time.  We conclude that the State properly
21FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
exercised its prosecutorial discretion in charging Pitolo in this
manner.  To the extent that the Circuit Court, in effect, treated
all six counts as a single "offense" for the purpose of
determining "the earliest date of the discovery of the offense"
in its application of HRS § 701-108(3)(a), it erred in doing
so.14  Each count of the Felony Information constitutes a
separate offense for the purpose of determining "the earliest
date of the discovery of the offense" for the purpose of
determining the extended statute of limitations pursuant to HRS
§ 701-108(3)(a).
B.Application of HRS § 701-108 to the Charged Offenses
Although the Circuit Court erred in applying the
statute of limitations in this manner, the court did not
necessarily err entirely in its conclusion that charges were
brought against Pitolo after the statute of limitations expired. 
As discussed above, the determinative issue is what is the
earliest date of discovery by an aggrieved party or a person who
has a legal duty to represent the aggrieved party, for each
offense charged by the State.
In Count 1, Pitolo is charged based on a continuing
course of conduct of theft by deception of property of the State
and/or WCO, between February 13, 2009, and July 16, 2010, by
writing unauthorized checks to Windsor.  Pursuant to HRS § 701-
108(4), this offense is committed "at the time when the course of
14Pitolo is, of course, free to ask the trier-of-fact to find that
there was just one culpable course of conduct.  If it is determined that
Pitolo's alleged acts all merge into and constitute a single continuing
course-of-conduct offense, nothing in this opinion should be construed to bar
her from seeking appropriate further relief based on that determination.
22FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
conduct or the defendant's complicity therein is terminated." 
Here, Pitolo's course of conduct that involved writing
unauthorized checks to Windsor, as alleged in Count 1, terminated
on July 16, 2010.15  The State, however, further avers that the
earliest date of discovery of this offense by the State or a
person who has a legal duty to represent the State was after
September 5, 2013.
The continuing-course-of-conduct offense charged in
Count 1 spanned the period of time from February 13, 2009, to
July 16, 2010.  The State admits that an allegedly unauthorized
check to Windsor was one of the unauthorized transactions
reported by Placencia in August 2010.16  The State submits,
however, that it will not seek to prosecute Pitolo based on this
particular item, which appears to have been dated September 4,
2009,17 in its prosecution of Pitolo on Count 1 and therefore,
the State argues, the 2010 discovery of this transaction should
not trigger the statute of limitations on the offense charged in
Count 1.
15We note that, because the continuing-course-of-conduct offense
charged in Count 1 did not terminate until July 16, 2010, pursuant to HRS
§ 701-108(4), the Circuit Court's earlier, May 27, 2010, "discovery date" is
not at all relevant to the statute of limitations period.  Similarly, the 
continuing-course-of-conduct offense charged in Count 3 did not terminate
until July 6, 2010, rendering the May 27, 2010 date irrelevant as to that
count.  See HRS § 701-108(4) ("if a legislative purpose to prohibit a
continuing course of conduct plainly appears, [an offense is committed] at the
time when the course of conduct or the defendant's complicity therein is
terminated").
16The State also disclosed this information in the sealed probable
cause affidavit in support of the Felony Information.
17The sealed probable cause affidavit identified the check to
Windsor by check number and amount and the police report included, inter alia ,
the date of the check with this check number and amount.
23FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
In Martin , the supreme court held that the State is not
precluded from charging a defendant with an offense covering only
part of the entire duration of a continuing-course-of-conduct
offense.  62 Haw. at 369-70, 616 P.2d at 197.  It did so based
primarily on cases in other jurisdictions that have held that,
with respect to a continuing offense that extends a period of
time, "the prosecution may charge and prove the offense in any
part of such period."  Id. at 369, 616 P.2d at 197 (citations
omitted).  
This case is distinguishable.  Here, in Count 1, the
State exercised its prosecutorial discretion to charge a
particular continuing-course-of-conduct offense spanning from
February 13, 2009, to July 16, 2010, as opposed to, for example,
separate offenses or a different period of time.  While it is
permissible to charge and prove the offense covering any part of
the time span of a continuing crime, and the State was free to do
so in this case, we hold that it is not permissible to disregard
discovered conduct that is (1) indisputably part of the
continuing course of conduct, as charged, and (2) that occurred
squarely within the charged period, in order to avoid the running
of the statute of limitations.  To conclude otherwise would
undermine the clear meaning and purpose of HRS § 701-108(3)(a), 
which is to allow the State an extended–but specifically limited– 
period of time to commence a prosecution, i.e. , within three
years after the earliest date of the discovery of the offense by
an aggrieved party or a person who has a legal duty to represent
the aggrieved party.  See Stan's Contracting, 111 Hawai# i at 34,
24FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
137 P.3d at 348.  Therefore, the statute of limitations on Count
1 began to run no later than the day after August 7, 2010,18 and,
as the Circuit Court concluded in part, the State failed to
commence prosecution for the offense charged in Count 1 within
three years of this date, i.e., by August 7, 2013.
Based on this analysis, the State's prosecution of
continuing-course-of-conduct offenses charged in Counts 2 and 3
is also untimely.  In Count 2, Pitolo is charged based on a
continuing course of conduct of theft by deception of property of
the State and/or WCO, between December 8, 2008, and April 16,
2010, by writing unauthorized checks to Salausa.  The State
admits that eight of the allegedly unauthorized checks to Salausa
were reported to HPD by Placencia in August 2010.19  Similarly,
in Count 3, Pitolo is charged based on a continuing course of
conduct of theft by deception of property of the State and/or
WCO, between March 16, 2007, and July 6, 2010, by writing
unauthorized checks to herself.  The State admits that six of the
allegedly unauthorized checks written to Pitolo were reported to
HPD by Placencia in August 2010.20  Therefore, for the reasons
18As the statute of limitations on Count 1 expired no later than
August 7, 2013, we need not reach the issue of whether it expired on July 16,
2013.
19This fact is also disclosed in the sealed probable cause affidavit
in support of the Felony Information.  Although the dates, amounts, and check
numbers of these checks are not included in the affidavit, based on the police
report, it appears that all of the checks reported to the police were dated
between September 4, 2009, and July 6, 2010, and Placencia discovered
unauthorized checks to Salausa on May 27, 2010.
20This fact is also disclosed in the sealed probable cause affidavit
in support of the Felony Information.  Although the dates, amounts, and check
numbers of these checks are not included in the affidavit, based on the police
report, it appears that all of the checks reported to the police were dated
between September 4, 2009, and July 6, 2010, Placencia discovered unauthorized
checks Pitolo wrote to herself on May 27, 2010.
25FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
stated above, we conclude that the statute of limitations on
Count 2 and 3 began to run no later than the day after August 7,
2010, and, as the Circuit Court concluded in part, the State
failed to commence prosecution for the offenses charged in Count
2 and 3 within three years of this date, i.e., by August 7, 2013.
However, as the State argues in conjunction with its
second point of error, as averred in Counts 4, 5, and 6, and as
supported by the sealed probable cause affidavit, the earliest
date of discovery of the offenses charged in each of Counts 4, 5,
and 6, by an aggrieved party or a person who has a legal duty to
represent the aggrieved party, was September 5, 2013.  There are
no discovered-but-omitted transactions with respect to the
offenses charged in Counts 4, 5, and 6 disclosed in the sealed
probable cause affidavit, reflected in the police reports, or
admitted by the State.  To be clear, the State still has the
burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt facts establishing that
these offenses were committed within the time period specified in
HRS § 701-108.  See HRS § 701-114(e) (2014).21  We conclude,
nevertheless, that the Circuit Court erred in dismissing Counts
4, 5, and 6, based on its erroneous reading of Stan's Contracting
21HRS § 701-114 provides, in relevant part:
§ 701-114  Proof beyond a reasonable doubt.   (1) . . .
[N]o person may be convicted of an offense unless the
following are proved beyond a reasonable doubt:
. . . .
(e) Facts establishing that the offense was
committed within the time period specified
in section 701-108.
(2) In the absence of the proof required by
subsection (1), the innocence of the defendant is presumed.

and its failure to properly apply HRS § 701-108(3)(a) to the
offenses charged in these counts.
