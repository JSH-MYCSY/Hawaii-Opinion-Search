ORDER RE RESPONSE TO ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE

 
AND

 
ORDER DISMISSING IN PART THE

 
JULY 18, 2016 WITHDRAWAL OF APPEAL WITHOUT PREJUDICE
AND THE APPEAL IS DISMISSED
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Fujise, JJ.)

 
Upon review of the "Response to OSC and Withdrawal of
 
Appeal Without Prejudice," filed July 18, 2016, by Defendant-
Appellant Sakaye Minami Fujii (Appellant), through attorney
 Anthony T. Fujii (Counsel), the papers in support, and the
 record, it appears that:
 
(1) On July 6, 2016, the court ordered Appellant to
 
file a civil appeals docketing statement within five days from
 the date of the order, and Counsel to show cause, within ten days
 from the date of the order, indicating why the civil appeals
 docketing statement had not been filed;

(2) On July 13, 2016, the court extended the time to
 
file a civil appeals docketing statement to July 25, 2016;
 
(3) In what appears to be a joint response to the July
 
6, 2016 order to show cause to Counsel, and a motion to dismiss
 
the appeal, Counsel indicates he filed the notice of appeal but
 Appellant does not want him to represent her in this appeal,
 Appellant led counsel to believe a substitution of counsel would
 occur, a substitution did not occur because Appellant cannot find
 an attorney to take her case, and Appellant wants to withdraw the
 appeal "without prejudice to all parties and claims";
 
(4) No further action is necessary for the July 6, 2016
 
order to show cause to Counsel; and
 
(5) Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 
42(a) authorizes the court to dismiss an appeal upon a motion where, as here, the appeal has not been docketed. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that no further 
action will be taken on the July 6, 2016 order to show cause to
 Anthony T. Fujii.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the motion to dismiss the 
appeal is granted in part, and the appeal is dismissed.
