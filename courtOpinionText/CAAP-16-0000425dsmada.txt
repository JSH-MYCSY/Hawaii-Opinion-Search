Upon review of the record here and in Office of

notice of appeal, through counsel, Anthony P. Locricchio
(Locricchio);

(3) The Graycocheas did not respond to the May 26, 2016
notice;
(4) On August 1, 2016, the appellate clerk entered a
default of the record on appeal, informing the Graycocheas that
the time to docket the appeal expired on July 25, 2016, they had
not paid the filing fee or obtained an order allowing them to
proceed on appeal in forma pauperis, the matter would be brought
to the court's attention on August 11, 2016, for action that may
include dismissal of the appeal, and they could seek relief from
default by motion;
(5) On August 18, 2016, the Graycocheas filed what the
court ultimately construed as a motion for relief from default
and extension of time for the record on appeal;
(6) On October 18, 2016, the Hawai #i Supreme Court
disbarred Locricchio, which ultimately became effective 
December 26, 2016;
(7) Pursuant to Rule 2.16(b) of the Rules of the
Supreme Court of the State of Hawai #i, Locricchio was required to
promptly notify his clients of his disbarment;
(8) On July 20, 2017, the court granted the August 18,
2016 motion in part, and ordered the Graycocheas either to pay
the appellate filing fee or file in the underlying case a motion
for leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis within twenty
days from the order.  The court cautioned the Graycocheas that
failure to pay the filing fee or file a motion for leave to
proceed on appeal in forma pauperis may result in the appeal
being dismissed.  The court noted that because the supreme court
had disbarred Locricchio, the Graycocheas were proceeding pro se,
unless substitute counsel entered an appearance.  The court
ordered the appellate clerk to contact the circuit court clerk to
ascertain the Graycocheas' mailing address(es) from the record in
the underlying case, and serve the order on them by mail.  The
appellate clerk mailed the order to the Graycocheas at the
address provided by the circuit court clerk, but the U.S. Postal
Service returned the envelopes, marked "Return to Sender, No Such
Number, Unable to Forward";

(9) The Graycocheas have not inquired about the status
of this case, provided the court with their current contact
information, as required by Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure
(HRAP) Rule 25(f), paid the appellate filing fees or obtained a
fee waiver, or taken any further action in this appeal; and
(10) An appeal may be dismissed where the record on
appeal has not been prepared because the appellant failed to pay 
the required fees or obtain an order allowing the appellant to
proceed in forma pauperis .  HRAP Rule 11(b)(2), (c)(2).
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is
dismissed.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the appellate clerk shall
mail this order to the Graycocheas at the address in the record
in the underlying case, Civil No. 12-1-2984, previously obtained
from the Clerk of the Circuit Court of the First Circuit.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, February 16, 2018.
