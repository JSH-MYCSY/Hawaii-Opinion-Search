Upon review of the record here and in Office
of Disciplinary Counsel v. Anthony P. Locricchio, 
No. SCAD-16-0000218,1 it appears that: 
(1) On May 24, 2016, Defendants-Appellants Guy Eugenio
and Lynn Maina-Aupo-Eugenio (the Eugenios) filed the notice of

Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 3(a);
(3) On August 1, 2016, the appellate clerk entered a
default of the record on appeal, informing the Eugenios that the
time to docket the appeal expired on July 25, 2016, they had not
paid the filing fee or obtained an order allowing them to proceed
on appeal in forma pauperis, the matter would be brought to the
court's attention on August 11, 2016, for action that may include
dismissal of the appeal, and they could seek relief from default
by motion;
(4) On August 18, 2016, the Eugenios filed what the
court ultimately construed as a motion for relief from default
and extension of time for the record on appeal;
(5) On October 18, 2016, the Hawai #i Supreme Court
disbarred Locricchio, which ultimately became effective 
December 26, 2016;
(6) Pursuant to Rule 2.16(b) of the Rules of the
Supreme Court of the State of Hawai #i, Locricchio was required to
promptly notify his clients of his disbarment;
(7) On February 28, 2018, the court granted the 
August 18, 2016 motion in part, and ordered the Eugenios either
to pay the appellate filing fees or file a motion for leave to
proceed on appeal in forma pauperis  within twenty days from the
order.  The court cautioned the Eugenios that failure to pay the
filing fee or file a motion for leave to proceed on appeal in
forma pauperis  may result in the appeal being dismissed.  The
court noted that because the supreme court had disbarred
Locricchio, the Eugenios were proceeding pro se, unless
substitute counsel entered an appearance.  The court ordered the
appellate clerk to serve the order on the Eugenios at their
mailing address listed in the appellate record.  The appellate
clerk mailed the order to the Eugenios at a P.O. Box and a
residential address.  The U.S. Postal Service returned the
envelope addressed to the residential address, marked "Return to
Sender, No Mail Receptacle, Unable to Forward," but the envelope
addressed to the P.O. Box was not returned;
(8) The Eugenios have not taken any further action in
this appeal; and

(9) An appeal may be dismissed where the record on
appeal has not been prepared because the appellant failed to pay 
the required fees or obtain an order allowing the appellant to
proceed in forma pauperis .  HRAP Rules 11(b)(2), (c)(2).
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is
dismissed.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the appellate clerk shall
mail this order to the Eugenios at their P.O. Box on record in
this appeal.
