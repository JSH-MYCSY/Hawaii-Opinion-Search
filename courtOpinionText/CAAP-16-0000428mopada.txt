IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
ALBERT BATALONA, Petitioner-Appellant,
v.
 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P. NO. 10-1-0075; CR. NO. 03-1-0787)
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Reifurth, Presiding Judge, Ginoza and Chan, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Albert Batalona (Batalona) appeals
 
from the "Amended Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order
 
Granting in Part and Denying in Part Petition for Post-Conviction
 Relief," filed on July 17, 2015 (7/17/15 Amended FOF/COL/Order),
 and the "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Order and Final
 Disposition Regarding Petition for Post-Conviction Relief," filed
 on April 27, 2016 (4/27/16 FOF/COL/Order), in the Circuit Court
 of the First Circuit (circuit court).
1 In the 7/17/15 Amended
 
FOF/COL/Order, the circuit court found, inter alia, the claim 
that Batalona's extended sentence was illegal under Apprendi v.
 New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), had been raised and ruled upon
 in his direct appeal. In the 4/27/16 FOF/COL/Order, after a
 hearing, the court ordered Batalona to apply at least ten percent

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
of any prison earnings toward the amount of money owed in
 
restitution.
 
On appeal, Batalona argues that the circuit court erred 
by denying his requests, in his Hawai 'i Rules of Penal Procedure 
2
(HRPP) Rule 40 Petition for Post-Conviction Relief,  to (1) set
aside the restitution order, based on insufficient findings and 
conclusions demonstrating that he could afford to pay restitution
 in the ordered amount, and (2) correct his illegal sentence,
 where the record revealed that his judgment of conviction and
 extended-term sentence became final on March 13, 2006, after
 Apprendi, Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296 (2004), and U.S. v.
 Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), taken together, established that a
 sentencing scheme in which the maximum possible sentence is set
 based on facts found by a judge is inconsistent with the Sixth
 Amendment of the United States Constitution.
 
I.
 
A.	 The circuit court abused its discretion by
concluding that Batalona could afford to pay the
amount of restitution ordered, based on
insufficient findings of fact.
 
The version of Section 706-605 (1) of the Hawaii
 
Revised Statutes (HRS) applicable at the time Batalona committed
 
the offenses required the circuit court to make any restitution
 ordered "in an amount the defendant can afford to pay."

 On September 30, 2010, Batalona filed a "Petition to Vacate, Set
Aside or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner from Custody Pursuant to
Hawai'i Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 40" (9/30/10 Rule 40 Petition). On 
October 24, 2012, he filed a "First Amended [Rule 40 Petition]" (10/24/12 Rule40 Petition). The circuit court construed together the 9/30/10 Rule 40Petition and 10/24/12 Rule 40 Petition as a single Rule 40 petition.

 Batalona committed the offenses prior to 2006. In State v. Curioso, 
(SDO) No. CAAP-13-0001014, 2014 WL 1271038, 132 Hawai' i 518, *2, 323 P.3d 162,
*2 (App. Mar. 28, 2014), this court explained: 
Before 2006, HRS § 706-605(1)(d) authorized a court to
sentence a convicted defendant "([t]o make restitution in an amount the defendant can afford to pay[.]" See 2006 Haw. 
Sess. Laws. Act 230 § 17 at 1007 (emphasis added).
Accordingly, courts were required to make findings as to adefendant's ability to pay the amount of restitution
specified in their orders under HRS § 706-605(1)(d). See 
[State v. Gaylord, 78 Hawai' i 127, 152, 890 P.2d 1167, 1192

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
§ 706-605(1) (Supp. 2003). 
In State v. Gaylord, 78 Hawai 'i 127, 153, 890 P.2d 
1167, 1193 (1995), the Hawai 'i Supreme Court (supreme court) 
explained, with regard to restitution orders, "it is incumbent 
upon the sentencing court to enter into the record findings of fact and conclusions that the manner of payment is reasonable and one which the defendant can afford." (Internal quotation marks, brackets, citation, and footnote omitted.) The supreme court explained in a footnote that "HRS § 706-605(1)(d) imposes upon the sentencing court the exclusive responsibility and function of determining the amount of restitution and acknowledges that the sentencing court does so by taking into consideration the defendant's circumstances known to the court at the time the sentence is imposed." Id. at 153 n.50, 890 P.2d at 1193 n. 50 
(quotation marks, citations, and italics omitted). 
In State v. Martin, 103 Hawai
'i 68, 77-78, 79 P.3d 686, 
695-96 (App. 2003), this court added that "unless the [restitution] payment will be in one payment or a few installments, neither the amount nor the installments can be determined without first deciding the time period available for payment." We held that "[t]he sentencing court, when it decides to order the defendant to pay restitution, must enter findings validating its decision that the total amount of restitution ordered is an amount the defendant is or will be able to pay during the time the restitution order remains unsatisfied and enforceable." Id. at 86, 79 P.3d at 704. 
(1995)]; see also State v. Werner, 93 Hawai' i 290, 296, 1
P.3d 760, 766 (App. 2000). It was "incumbent upon the
[sentencing] court to enter into the record findings of factand conclusions that the manner of payment is reasonable and
one which [the defendant] can afford." Gaylord, 78 Hawai' i 
at 153, 890 P.2d at 1193 (citation and internal quotation
marks omitted). 
. . . . Act 230, Session Laws 2006, amended HRS § 706-605
to "[r]equire[] that when restitution is ordered, the amount
ordered not be based on the defendant's financial ability to
make restitution but such ability may be considered in
establishing the time and manner of payment[.]" H. Stand.
 Comm. Rep. No. 665-06 at 2 (Mar. 2, 2006)[.]

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In State v. Werner, 93 Hawai 'i 290, 297, 1 P.3d 760, 
767 (App. 2000), we held that, under Gaylord, the circuit court
 
must enter findings and conclusions illustrating that the
 defendant can afford to pay the restitution amount, which
 includes determining the relevant time period, the defendant's
gross income, and necessary expenses during the relevant time
 period.
  
In this case, in its 4/27/16 FOF/COL/Order the circuit
 
court found the following, in relevant part:
 
18. At further hearing on the Petition, the State
presented witness, Howard Komori ("Mr. Komori"), the Acting
Administrator of Non-State Facilities, which includes
Saguaro, located in Arizona. Mr. Komori testified regarding
[Batalona's] ability and opportunity to earn a wage, and the
procedure for inmate's monetary accounts at Saguaro. An
 inmate has the opportunity to work to earn a wage subject to
job availability and subject to disciplinary action.
 
19. Hearing on this matter was continued to January
27, 2016. [Batalona] testified that he had worked while
incarcerated at Saguaro in the past. He stated his monthly
earnings were about $30 per month.
 
The circuit court concluded:
 
1. Pursuant to the records in the above-captioned
matter and pursuant to evidence adduced at hearing on the
petition, the trial court in Criminal Number 03-1-0787 did
not make a specific finding regarding [Batalona's] ability
to pay the restitution ordered.
 
2. Under [HRS] § 353-22.6, the Department of Public
Safety "shall enforce victim restitution orders against all
moneys earned by the inmate or deposited or credited to the
inmate's individual account while incarcerated."
 
3. HRS § 353-22.6, Victim Restitution, requires
payments of 25% of a prisoner's actual earnings. However,
the version of the statute in effect at the time the court
 issued its order with respect to [Batalona], required only a
10% contribution, thus [Batalona] is required to make
payments of only 10% of his prison earnings, and is limited
to moneys earned by [Batalona].
 
4. [Batalona] has the ability to earn a wage while
incarcerated at Saguaro, and thus has the ability to make
regular restitution payments. To the extent [Batalona] is
employed earning moneys from prison work, 10% of any prison
earnings established is ordered to be applied toward the
satisfaction of the restitution ordered.
 
Although the circuit court satisfied the requirement to
 
prescribe a reasonable manner of payment by ordering Batalona to
 
pay ten percent of his gross income, see id. at 296, 1 P.3d at
 
4
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
766, the court did not ultimately find or enter sufficient
 
preliminary findings specifically illustrating that Batalona
 could afford to pay the amount of restitution ordered. The court
 merely found that as an inmate, Batalona had the ability to make
 an income and had worked while incarcerated in the past, making
 about thirty dollars per month. Based on his conviction in a
 prior case, Batalona is sentenced to life in prison without the
 possibility of parole.
4 The circuit court did not make findings
 
as to whether, given his life sentence, the amount of his
 anticipated gross income, and necessary expenses, Batalona could
 afford to pay the restitution.
 
Accordingly, the circuit court abused its discretion in
 
concluding that Batalona could afford to pay the amount of
 restitution ordered, based on insufficient findings of fact.
B. 	The circuit court was not wrong to conclude that
Apprendi does not apply to Batalona's sentence. 
Batalona argues that the circuit court erred in
 
summarily denying his request to correct his illegal sentence
 
where his judgment of conviction and extended-term sentence
 became final on March 13, 2006, after the Apprendi, Blakely, and
 Booker rulings, which together, established that a sentencing
 scheme in which the maximum possible sentence was set based on
 facts found by a judge was inconsistent with the Sixth 
Amendment. 
The State concedes this point, stating that: 
Because [Batalona's] direct appeal was pending well after
Apprendi was issued, and Hawai' i Courts are bound by
Apprendi, [Batalona's] extended term of ten years on his
class C felony conviction cannot stand because the circuitcourt, and not a jury, found the fact of "necessary forprotection of the public" which increased [Batalona's]

 In Criminal No. 99-1549, Batalona was sentenced to life imprisonment
without the possibility of parole. Batalona was also assessed a fine of
 $10,000, and he and his two co-defendants were ordered to pay restitution of
$9448, jointly and severally (Batalona's share was $3149).
On January 9, 2004, Batalona was sentenced to an extended-term of
imprisonment of ten years for the offense of Escape in the Second Degree.
This sentence was to run consecutive to his aforementioned life sentence.

sentence beyond the prescribed statutory maximum of five
years.
 
Notwithstanding the State's concession, "appellate
 
courts have an independent duty 'first to ascertain that the
 
confession of error is supported by the record and well-founded
 in law and second to determine that such error is properly
 preserved and prejudicial.'" State v. Veikoso, 102 Hawai
'i 219, 
221–22, 74 P.3d 575, 577–78 (2003) (quoting State v. Hoang, 93
 Hawai
'i 333, 336, 3 P.3d 499, 502 (2000)). In other words, the 
State's concession of error "is not binding upon an appellate
 court . . . ." Hoang, 93 Hawai
'i at 336, 3 P.3d at 502 (quoting 
Territory v. Kogami, 37 Haw. 174, 175 (Haw. Terr. 1945))
 (internal quotation marks omitted).
 
The State argues that Batalona's sentence must be
 
vacated because Batalona's 2006 appeal was pending long after
 Apprendi was decided. However, as this court recently explained:
 
Until [State v. Maugaotega, 115 Hawai' i 432, 168 P.3d 562
(2007)], the Hawai' i Supreme Court repeatedly upheld the
constitutionally [sic] of Hawai' i's extended term sentencing
scheme in the face of challenges based on Apprendi and its
progeny, Blakely and Booker. It was the United States Supreme Court's 2007 decision in [Cunningham v. California,549 U.S. 270, 127 S.Ct. 856 (2007)] that caused the Hawai' i 
Supreme Court to change its view and hold that Hawai' i's 
extended term sentencing scheme was unconstitutional underApprendi, despite the limitations the Hawai' i Supreme Court
had imposed through its intrinsic/extrinsic analysis.Therefore, under the Hawai' i Supreme Court's interpretation
of federal constitutional law, it was Cunningham and notApprendi that announced the new rule that dictated and madeclear that Hawai' i's extended term sentencing scheme was
unconstitutional. Accordingly, based on the precedents ofthe Hawai' i Supreme Court, it is Cunningham that establishes
the line of demarcation – that is, extended term sentencesthat became final after Apprendi but before Cunningham arenot subject to collateral attack. 
Mara v. State, 139 Hawai 'i 414, 419, 391 P.3d 1236, 1241 (App. 
2017) (footnote omitted). Here, on March 2, 2006, Batalona
 
petitioned for a writ of certiorari to the Hawai 'i Supreme Court. 
On March 13, 2006, the supreme court denied the application. 
Therefore, Batalona's sentence became final on March 13, 2006,
 before Cunningham was decided.

II.
 
Given the foregoing, the part of the 4/27/16
 
FOF/COL/Order that orders Batalona to apply ten percent of any
 
prison earnings toward the remaining amount of money owed in
 restitution is vacated and the case is remanded with instructions
 to the circuit court to (1) determine whether Batalona can afford
 to pay the amount of restitution ordered and, if so, (2) issue
 appropriate findings and conclusions specifically illustrating
 that he can afford to pay that amount.
 
For the reasons set forth in this opinion, the 7/17/15
 
Amended FOF/COL/Order is affirmed with respect to the Apprendi
 issue.
