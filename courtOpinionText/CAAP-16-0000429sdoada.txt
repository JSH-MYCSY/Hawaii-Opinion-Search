SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Chan, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Anthony K. Chatman (Chatman), pro
se, appeals from the "Order Denying Motion for Correction or
Modification of the Record Filed May 18, 2015 and Motion for
Disqualification Filed September 10, 2015," entered on April 28,
2016 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit court).1
On July 19, 2004, after a consolidated trial, Chatman
was convicted of Attempted Murder in the Second Degree, in
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 705-500(2), 707-
701.5, and 706-656, in FC-Cr. No. 02-1-0011, and Bribery of a
Witness, in violation of HRS § 710-1070, Intimidating a Witness,
in violation of HRS § 710-1071, and Extortion in the Second
Degree, in violation of HRS §§ 707-764 and -766, in Cr. No. 02-1-
2353.

On August 23, 2004, Chatman filed a Notice of Appeal in
appeal no. 26763.  Chatman's Opening Brief raised ten points of
error.
On August 3, 2006, the supreme court vacated Chatman's
conviction for Extortion in the Second Degree and affirmed his
remaining convictions in both cases.
On May 12, 2008, Chatman filed with the circuit court a
"Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release
Petitioner from Custody," pursuant to Rule 40 of the Hawai# i
Rules of Penal Procedure (first HRPP Rule 40 petition).  The
first HRPP Rule 40 petition challenged Chatman's convictions in
both cases on the grounds that his trial counsel provided
ineffective assistance when it failed to 1) secure the testimony
of a witness at trial, and 2) investigate and secure the
appearance of witnesses for the hearing on the motion for a new
trial.2
On January 26, 2009, in S.P.P. No. 08-1-0019, the
circuit court denied Chatman's first HRPP Rule 40 petition,
holding that "the Petition is patently frivolous and without a
trace of support either in the record or from other evidence
submitted by the Petitioner . . . ." 
On March 24, 2010, in appeal No. 29504, this court
affirmed the circuit court's denial of Chatman's first HRPP Rule
40 petition.
On May 18, 2015, Chatman filed a "Motion for Correction
or Modification of the Record" (Motion for Correction), pursuant
to Rule 10(e) of the Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure.  In
the Motion for Correction, Chatman describes a portion of the
trial transcript that occurred on  June 18, 2003 that appears to
be missing from the record, and requests that the record be
corrected to include the missing part of the transcript.  Chatman
claims that at the time of his direct appeal, his appellate
2Chatman had claimed ineffective assistance of counsel when he
appealed his conviction and sentence in appeal no. 26763, but this claim was
deemed premature by the supreme court and denied without prejudice.

counsel did not notice that the aforementioned portion of the
transcript was missing from the record on appeal, therefore, he
was prejudiced by his inability to challenge "whether the trial
court abused its discretion in denying declarant's request for a
mistrial."
On September 10, 2015, Chatman filed a "Motion for
Disqualification," arguing that Judge Karen S. S. Ahn should have
recused herself from presiding over Chatman's trial on the
grounds of judicial bias.  In the Motion for Disqualification,
Chatman specifically references a comment Judge Ahn made during a
bench conference about Chatman being of African American descent,
and argues that the comment demonstrated Judge Ahn's racial bias
and prejudice against Chatman.
On April 28, 2016, the circuit court issued an order
denying both the Motion for Correction and the Motion for
Disqualification.
In the instant appeal, Chatman contends that the
circuit court erred by denying his Motion for Correction and
Motion for Disqualification.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we affirm.
We first note that both the Motion for Correction and
the Motion for Disqualification are, in effect, HRPP Rule 40
petitions for post-conviction relief.  The issues raised by
Chatman in his Motion for Correction and Motion for
Disqualification were not raised in his first HRPP Rule 40
petition, and generally, relief under HRPP Rule 40 is not
afforded where the petitioner knowingly and understandingly
failed to raise an issue in a prior HRPP Rule 40 proceeding.3
3Rule 40  POST-CONVICTION PROCEEDING.
(a) Proceedings and grounds.  The post-conviction proceeding
established by this rule shall encompass all common law and
statutory procedures for the same purpose, including habeas
corpus and coram nobis; provided that the foregoing shall
not be construed to limit the availability of remedies in
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
Here, we conclude that Chatman waived the issues raised
in the Motion for Correction and the Motion for Disqualification
by not raising them in his first HRPP Rule 40 petition.  With
respect to the Motion for Correction, Chatman claims that he
failed to previously raise the issue of the missing portion of
the June 18, 2003 transcript because at the time of his direct
appeal, his appellate counsel did not notice that the portion of
the transcript was missing.  However, the record shows that the
transcript of the June 18, 2003 hearing was filed with the
circuit court on December 28, 2004.  With respect to the Motion
for Disqualification, Chatman claims that he failed to previously
raise the issue of Judge Ahn's comment regarding Chatman's race
because he had not been privy to the May 30, 2003 bench
conference during which the comment was made.  However, the
record shows that the transcript of the May 30, 2003 hearing was
filed with the circuit court on February 22, 2005.  Therefore,
the transcripts were accessible for Chatman to review prior to
the filing of his first HRPP Rule 40 petition on May 12, 2008. 
Therefore, we do not believe that these reasons constitute
"extraordinary circumstances to justify petitioner's failure to
raise the issue."  See HRPP Rule 40(a)(3).
the trial court or on direct appeal.  Said proceeding shall
be applicable to judgments of conviction and to custody
based on judgments of conviction, as follows:
. . . .
 (3) Inapplicability.  Rule 40 proceedings shall not be
available and relief thereunder shall not be granted
where the issues sought to be raised have been
previously ruled upon or were waived.  Except for a
claim of illegal sentence, an issue is waived if the
petitioner knowingly and understandingly failed to
raise it and it could have been raised before the
trial, at the trial, on appeal, in a habeas corpus
proceeding or any other proceeding actually conducted,
or in a prior proceeding actually initiated under this
rule, and the petitioner is unable to prove the
existence of extraordinary circumstances to justify
the petitioner's failure to raise the issue.  There is
a rebuttable presumption that a failure to appeal a
ruling or to raise an issue is a knowing and
understanding failure.
