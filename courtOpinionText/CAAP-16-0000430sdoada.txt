APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 13-1-03115) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Ginoza, C.J., and Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.) 
This  case  a rises  out  of  an  action  brought  by 
Plaintiff-Appellee  First  Hawaiian  Bank  ("FHB")  against  former 
owner  Defendant-Appellee  Wade  Allen  Hamlin,  seeking  to 
foreclose  upon  a  mortgage  lien  on  Hamlin's  unit  in  the  Sun 
Rise  condominium  project  in  #Ewa  Beach,  Hawai #i  ("the  Unit").  
In  November  2013,  FHB  initiated  judicial  foreclosure 
proceedings  in  the  Circuit  Court  of  the  First  Circuit 
("Circuit  Court")  alleging  that  Hamlin  defaulted  on  his 1/

          mortgage payments. Defendant-Appellant Association of Apartment Owners of Sun Rise, Inc. ("the AOAO") was named as a defendant in the case because it held an interest in the Unit as the result of a non-judicial foreclosure it had initiated on the Unit in April 2013 with regard to Hamlin's alleged failure to pay Unit-related AOAO fees. 
The foreclosure decree and related judgment were 
never appealed. Instead, post-confirmation of sale proceedings focused on the scope of the Circuit Court's powers 
to control and direct when title transfers to the subsequent 
purchaser at the conclusion of a foreclosure sale, and when the subsequent purchaser of a foreclosed unit is deemed to be responsible for paying assessments and fees. The AOAO appeals from the following two post-judgment orders entered by the Circuit Court: 
(1) The January 13, 2016 "Order Granting in Part and 
Denying in Part Plaintiff's Motion Re: Order Granting Plaintiff First Hawaiian Bank's Motion for Confirmation of Sale, Directing Distribution of Proceeds, for Deficiency Judgment, Writ of Possession and Disposal of Personal Property, Filed November 24, 2014, Filed Herein on April 6, 2015, for [1] Determination that Defendant Association of

Contempt Sanction Against Defendant Association of Apartment Owners of Sun Rise, Inc., Filed Herein on January 25, 2016" ("April 28, 2016 Order"). I. Background 
In January 2006, Hamlin purchased the Unit, along 
with a 2.3% interest in all common elements of the AOAO's condominium project "Sun Rise - Phase H." Hamlin obtained a 
loan from FHB, secured by a note and mortgage on the Unit. On 
April 1, 2013, due to Hamlin's failure to pay the maintenance fees on the Unit, the AOAO completed a non-judicial foreclosure of the Unit by Quitclaim Deed, conveying the Unit to itself. The AOAO thereafter rented out the Unit to a new tenant, and collected the rental proceeds. On October 28, 2013, Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., as FHB's nominee, assigned the mortgage to FHB. 
On November 25, 2013, due to Hamlin's default on his 
mortgage payments, FHB filed a complaint for foreclosure against the AOAO and Hamlin (collectively "Defendants"). FHB filed a motion for summary judgment and a decree of foreclosure ("MSJ") against Defendants. AOAO took no position 
regarding the foreclosure, but stated that it was equitable 
for the AOAO to continue collecting rent from the Unit because it "incurred substantial time, effort and expense to secure title and possession." FHB asserted that if the AOAO was allowed to continue collecting rent, the AOAO should be required to provide an accounting of that rent. The hearing on FHB's MSJ took place on August 13, 2014. 
On September 16, 2014, the Circuit Court entered the 
order granting FHB's MSJ ("Foreclosure Decree") and corresponding judgment. The Foreclosure Decree stated that the AOAO would continue to maintain possession of the Unit, and directed the AOAO to "file an accounting of the rental 
income collected, its application to delinquent maintenance 
fees and costs, and any excess rental income remaining prior to the hearing to confirm the sale of the [Unit]." 
On November 24, 2014, the Commissioner conducted a

       public auction for the Unit during which FHB was the sole and successful bidder. That same day, FHB filed its motion for confirmation of sale ("Confirmation Motion"), which the AOAO did not oppose. At the December 18, 2014 hearing on the Confirmation Motion, the Circuit Court orally granted the motion, but because the AOAO still had not submitted the accounting of rental proceeds as directed by the Foreclosure Decree, the court set a status conference to address the matter, and eventually ordered supplemental briefing by FHB 
and the AOAO to address the issue of excess rental proceeds. 
On April 6, 2015, the Circuit Court entered the order granting FHB's Confirmation Motion ("Confirmation Order") and the corresponding judgment. The order stated that upon delivery of the Unit to FHB or its nominee, all parties would be barred from any interest in the Unit except for "a proper lien for unpaid special assessments levied pursuant to HRS ยง 514B -
146(g), (h), and (i)[.]" 
On June 10, 2015, the AOAO sent a letter to FHB, 
referencing authority under HRS section 514B-146(g) and requesting payment of a five-month special assessment for unpaid amounts between November 1, 2012, and April 1, 2013 ("June 10, 2015 Letter"). On June 17, 2015, FHB filed a 
motion which, in relevant part, sought to clarify that the 
AOAO was entitled to nothing in the way of a special assessment from FHB under HRS section 514B-146 ("Clarification Motion"). FHB additionally requested an extension of time to close the foreclosure sale because the issue of the amount of special assessments owed to the AOAO was contributing to delays in closing the foreclosure sale. On July 30, 2015, the AOAO withdrew its request for payment of the special assessment, but asserted its right to collect assessments and common expenses as of February 16, 2015 pursuant to HRS section 514B-146(b). 
At the hearing on the Clarification Motion, the AOAO 
reiterated that it was a mistake to request a special assessment pursuant to its June 10, 2015 Letter, but maintained that it was entitled to collect continuing

         maintenance fees beginning "60 days after the hearing on the 
Order Confirming Sale, which was February 16, 2015[.]" On August 24, 2015, the Circuit Court entered the order granting the Clarification Motion, extending the close of sale, and finding that the amount of the special assessment that AOAO could claim under HRS section 514B-146 was "zero" ("Clarification Order"). 
On September 1, 2015, the Commissioner's Quitclaim 
Apartment Deed ("Commissioner's Deed") was recorded in the 
State of Hawai #i Office of Assistant Registrar, thereby 
co
nveying title of the Unit from the Commissioner to the 
Secretary of Veterans Affairs ("VA"), as nominee for FHB. On 
September 2, 2015, the AOAO made a demand on escrow for an additional payment in order to release the lien on the Unit, part of which the AOAO claimed should be paid by the subsequent purchaser (i.e., VA) in the form of its attorneys' fees and costs incurred in the foreclosure action. On October 1, 2015, the AOAO stated, in an email sent to FHB, that it was only seeking attorneys' fees and costs incurred after February 16, 2015. 
On O
ctober 20, 2015, FHB filed a post-judgment 
motion in which it requested that the Circuit Court issue a 
post-judgment order (1) declaring that the AOAO was not 
entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and costs and (2) sanctioning the AOAO for intentionally failing to follow the terms of the Confirmation Order by first seeking a special assessment, and then later, seeking to levy its attorneys' fees and costs against the subsequent purchaser. 
The Circuit Court entered the January 13, 2016 
Order, granting in part and denying in part FHB's October 20, 2015 post-judgment motion. The Circuit Court agreed that the AOAO was not entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and costs, but declined to sanction the AOAO. The AOAO filed a motion for reconsideration regarding the January 13, 2016 
Order ("Reconsideration Motion"). On April 28, 2016, the 
Circuit Court entered an order denying the AOAO's Reconsideration Motion. On May 26, 2016, the AOAO timely

         appealed from the January 13, 2016 Order and the April 28, 
2016 Order. 
II. Points of error. 
On  appeal,  the  AOAO  alleges  that  the  Circuit  Court 
(A)  reversibly  erred  when  it  determined  that  the  VA  became  the 
owner  of  the  Unit  as  of  September  1,  2015,  and  therefore,  was 
responsible  for  all  fees  and  assessments  beginning  on  that 
date;  and  (B)  erred  in  denying  its  Reconsideration  Motion. 
III. Discussion 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as well as the relevant statutory and case law, we affirm. 
(A) In its first point of error, the AOAO asserts 
that the Circuit Court reversibly erred by failing to apply the plain and unambiguous language of HRS section 514B-146(b), which establishes when a mortgagee or other purchaser takes title to a unit after a mortgage foreclosure, to the facts of 
this case. Specifically, the AOAO argues that the VA must be 
deemed to hold title to the Unit as of February 16, 2015 (sixty days after the hearing on the Motion to Confirm), not as of September 1, 2015 (when the instrument of conveyance was recorded), and subsequently must pay the common expenses and assessments (including attorneys' fees and costs) due and owing to the AOAO from February 16, 2015 until the closing. In the alternative, the AOAO argues that even if the VA did not take title until September 1, 2015, the VA and FHB waived and/or are estopped or are precluded by quasi-estoppel from making any objections to paying assessments for AOAO's attorneys' fees and costs. The AOAO's arguments are without 
merit. 
HRS section 514B-146 (Supp. 2013) provides, in 
relevant part, that: 
(b) . . . [W]hen the mortgagee of a mortgage of
record or other purchaser of a unit obtains title to the
unit as a result of foreclosure of the mortgage, the

      acquirer of title and the acquirer's successors and assigns
shall not be liable for the share of the common expenses or
assessments by the association chargeable to the unit that
became due prior to the acquisition of title to the unit by
the acquirer. The unpaid share of common expenses or
assessments shall be deemed to be common expenses
collectible from all of the unit owners, including the
acquirer and the acquirer's successors and assigns. The 
mortgagee of record or other purchaser of the unit shall be deemed to acquire title and shall be required to pay the 
unit's share of common expenses and assessments beginning : 
(1) Thirty-six days after the order confirming the
sale to the purchaser has been filed with the
court; 
(2) Sixty days after the hearing at which the court
grants the motion to confirm the sale to the
purchaser; 
(3) Thirty days after the public sale in a
nonjudicial power of sale foreclosure conducted
pursuant to chapter 667; or 
(4) Upon the recording of the instrument of
conveyance; 
whichever occurs first[.] 
Haw.  Rev.  Stat.  ยง  514B-146(b)  (emphasis  added).   A  mortgagee 
of  record  or  other  purchaser  of  the  unit,  however,  will  not  be 
deemed  to  have  acquired  title  under  HRS  section  514B-
146(b)(1)-(3)  if  transfer  of  title  is  delayed  as  specified  in 
the  statute  and  either  of  the  following  limiting-events  occur: 
[1]  w hen  a  person  who  appears  at  the  hearing  on  the  motion 
or  a  party  to  the  foreclosure  action  requests 
reconsideration  o f  the  motion  or  order  to  confirm  sale , [ 2]  
objects  to  the  form  of  the  proposed  order  to  confirm  sale ,
[3]  appeals  the  decision  of  the  court  to  grant  the  motion  to
confirm  s ale,  or [
4] the debtor or mortgagor declares
bankruptcy or is involuntarily placed into bankruptcy. 
Id.  (emphasis  added).   If  one  of  these  limiting-events  and  the 
specified  delay  occurs,  "the  mortgagee  of  record  or  other 
purchaser  of  the  unit  shall  be  deemed  to  acquire  title  upon 
recordation  of  the  instrument  of  conveyance."   Id.    
The  AOAO  argues  that  none  of  the  limiting-events 
occurred,  and  that  therefore,  the  date  that  VA  acquired  title 
to  the  Unit  was  the  earliest  date  under  HRS  section  514(b)(1)-
(3),  which  was  February  16,  2015,  sixty  days  after  the  hearing 
at  which  the  Circuit  Court  granted  the  Confirmation  Motion.  
FHB,  on  the  other  hand,  maintains  that  at  least  one  of  the 
limiting-events  occurredโeither  by  the  AOAO's  conduct  in

  delaying the closing of the sale,2/ which FHB construes as an 
"object[ion] to the form of the proposed order to confirm 
sale," or by effectively forcing FHB to file its Clarification Motion, which FHB characterizes as a motion for reconsideration, before the AOAO conceded that its demand for fees in its June 10, 2015 Letter was inappropriateโand that therefore, the date that the VA acquired title was when the conveyance instrument was recorded. As both the AOAO and FHB were parties to the foreclosure action, the dispositive issue 
is whether the AOAO's request for a special assessment or 
FHB's request in its Clarification Motion to declare that the AOAO was entitled to nothing by way of a special assessment constituted either an "object[ion] to the form of the proposed order to confirm sale" or a "request[] [for] reconsideration of the motion or order to confirm sale," under HRS section 514B-146(b). 
In its January 13, 2016 Order, the Circuit Court 
found in relevant part that 
AOAO's  attempt  to  seek  a  special  assessment  after  entry  of 
the  Order  Confirming  Sale  []  was  tantamount  to  either  a 
reconsideration  of  the  Order  Confirming  Sale  or  an  objection
to  the  form  of  the  Order  Confirming  Sale,  and  that  []  AOAO
should  not  be  entitled  to  collect  common  expenses  and
assessments  that  resulted  from  its  own  actions  in  delaying
the  closing  of  this  foreclosure  sale.   As  such,  and  pursuant
to  Hawaii  Revised  Statutes  ยง  514B-146(b),  the  subsequent
purchaser  was  deemed  to  have  acquired  title  to  the  [Unit]  as
of  September  1,  2015,  the  date  on  which  the  Commissioner's
Quitclaim  Deed  was  recorded.  
(Emphasis added.) The Circuit Court echoed this determination in its April 28, 2016 Order, ruling that the AOAO's request for special assessment delayed the closing and resulted in FHB filing its Clarification Motion. In effect, the Circuit Court determined that substantively the AOAO's June 10, 2015 Letter constituted either an "object[ion] to the form of the proposed order to confirm sale" or a "request[] [for] reconsideration 
2/ FHB identifies several instances as examples of delay: (1) the
A
OAO's  failure  to  timely  provide  accounting  of  the  rent  it  collected  after
acquiring  title  to  the  Unit, (2) the  AOAO's  objection  to  FHB's  supplemental
memo  in  support  of  its  Motion  for  Confirmation  in  which  the  AOAO  challenged
FHB's  assertion  that  there  was  excess  rental  income  collected  by  the  AOAO,  and
(3)  the  A OAO's  demand  for  a  six-month  special  assessment  in  its  June  10,  2015
Letter.

         of the motion or order to confirm sale," thereby triggering 
one of the limiting-events and establishing that the VA was "deemed to acquire title upon recordation of the [Commissioner's Deed]" under HRS section 514B-146(b). The Circuit Court additionally determined that FHB's Clarification Motion was a motion for reconsideration of the Confirmation Order, and therefore, its ruling under HRS section 514B-146(b) was appropriate. 
The AOAO's argument notwithstanding, the Circuit 
Court never characterized the AOAO's June 10, 2015 Letter as a motion for reconsideration or a formally filed-objection. 
Rather, the Circuit Court characterized the AOAO's action of 
attempting to seek special assessment after the Confirmation 
Order as tantamount to reconsideration or an objection to the 
form of the Confirmation Order. The Circuit Court's application of the statute is in accord with its plain language, the starting point of statutory interpretation. First Ins. Co. of Hawaii v. A&B Props. , 126 Hawai #i 406, 414, 
27
1 P.3d 1165, 1173 (2012) ("[T]he fundamental starting point 
for statutory-interpretation is the language of the statute itself." (quoting State v. Wheeler , 121 Hawai #i 383, 390, 219 
P.3d 1170, 1177 (2009))). Under HRS section 514B-146(b), to toll the date that the subsequent purchaser "acquire[s] title," "a party to the foreclosure action" needs to "request[] reconsideration of the motion or order to confirm 
sale" or " object [] to the form of the proposed order to 
confirm sale." Haw. Rev. Stat. ยง514B-146(b) (emphasis added). Here, the AOAO's attempt to seek an admittedly improper 
special assessment, when the Confirmation Order was silent on 
the subjectโand in fact provided that all parties would be barred from any interest in the Unit except for "a proper lien 
for unpaid special assessments levied pursuant to HRS ยง 514B -
146
(g), (h), and (i)"โcould fairly be construed as requesting

    id. at 1240 (defining "object" as "[t]o state in opposition"). 
Furthermore, FHB never contended that its 
Clarification Motion was a motion for reconsideration. 
Rather, FHB stated, "The request by [FHB] in the Clarification 
Motion was expressly a request for the [Circuit] Court to 
reconsider the Order Confirming Sale and the amount of the 
special assessment lien that [the] AOAO was entitled to claim 
as part of the closing of the foreclosure sale." (Emphasis added.) As explained above, the Confirmation Order did not address the AOAO's special assessment lien, which can be construed as an omission in the order. Therefore, it was reasonable to conclude that FHB's request that the Circuit Court reconsider the amount of the AOAO's special assessment lien in its Clarification Motionโwhich the Circuit Court noted was filed in response to the AOAO's June 10, 2015 Letterโcould be construed as "request[ing] reconsideration of the motion or order to confirm sale" under HRS section 514B-146(b). See 
Black's Law Dictionary at 1170 (defining "motion for 
reconsideration" as "[a] party's request that the court allow another hearing of a . . . motion . . . to consider an alleged 
. . . omission in the court's judgment or opinion"). 
Therefore, the Circuit Court did not err in 
determining that the VA acquired title to the Unit as of 
September 1, 2015, the date on which the Commissioner's Deed was recorded, because the AOAO's request for special assessment constituted either "object[ing] to the form of the proposed order to confirm sale" or "request[ing] reconsideration of the motion or order to confirm sale" under the statute, and/or FHB's Clarification Motion constituted "object[ing] to the form of the proposed order to confirm sale" under the statute. See Haw. Rev. Stat. ยง 514B-146(b). 
Consequently, the Circuit Court also did not err in determining that the VA was not responsible for any of the Unit's fees or common expenses and assessments prior to that date. See id.

      In the alternative, the AOAO argues that even if the 
Circuit Court did not err in its application of HRS section 
514B-146(b) and title to the Unit did not transfer to the VA until September 1, 2015, the VA's uncontested payment of maintenance fees, late fees, and interest incurred from February 16, 2015 operated as a waiver of any objection to payment for the attorneys' fees and costs incurred during that period. The AOAO further argues that FHB is estopped from objecting to the VA's payment of these assessments because it 
"admitted that the VA paid these amounts 'in order to 
facilitate closing and avoid future litigation.'" If FHB or the VA wanted to contest the payment of assessments for the AOAO's attorneys fees and costs, the AOAO maintains that FHB or VA needed to follow the appropriate procedure under HRS section 514-146(d). 
Preliminarily, we decline to address the estoppel or 
quasi-estoppel argument. This appears to be the first time the AOAO has raised the argument, and the AOAO fails to provide a citation as to where in the record it preserved the issue for appeal. The argument is therefore deemed waived. See Asato v. Procurement Policy Bd. , 132 Hawai #i 333, 354 n.22, 
32
2 P.3d 228, 249 n.22 (2014) (citing State v. Moses , 102 
Hawai #i 449, 456, 77 P.3d 940, 947 (2003) ("As a general rule, 
if a party does not raise an argument at trial, that argument will be deemed to have been waived on appeal.") (brackets omitted)); Haw. R. App. P. 28(b)(4) (requiring that an appellant identify in his or her opening brief where in the record on appeal an objection was raised to the trial court and noting that "[p]oints not presented in accordance with this section will be disregarded"). We proceed then to the merits of the AOAO's remaining argument. 
A waiver "'may be expressed or implie[d],' and '[i]t
may be established by express statement or agreement, or by
acts and conduct from which an intention to waive may be
reasonably inferred.'" Wilart Assocs. v. Kapiolani Plaza, 
Ltd. , 7 Haw. App. 354, 359โ60, 766 P.2d 1207, 1210โ11 (1988)
(citations omitted) (brackets in original). 
Generally, waiver is defined as an intentional
relinquishment of a known right, a voluntary
relinquishment of rights, and the relinquishment or

P.2d  28,  36  (1985).  To  constitute  a  waiver,  there  must
have  existed  a  right  claimed  to  have  been  waived  and 
the  waiving  party  must  have  had  knowledge,  actual  or
constructive,  of  the  existence  of  such  a  right  at  the
time  of  the  purported  waiver.  Honolulu  Fed.  Sav.  &

8, 376 (2002). In order to prevail, the AOAO needs to 
establish that: (1) there was an existing right claimed to 
have been waived, and (2) the waiving-party had knowledge, 
either actual or constructive, of that right at the time of waiver. 
The 
AOAO argues that the VA's request for a payoff 
amount from the AOAO and the VA's subsequent payment of maintenance fees, late fees, and interest assessed from February 2015 to September 2015 operated as a waiver. Citing to correspondence from the VA to the AOAO in which the VA requested a payoff letter to facilitate closing of the Unit, the AOAO maintains that this conduct indicates the VA's willingness to pay off any amounts due and owing to the AOAO. The VA's request for a payoff letter does not explicitly identify the right to contest payment of any and all 
attorneys' fees and costs. Rather, it states that the VA 
needed to know, in relevant part, "attorney fees, if applicable, for Procurement costs of the payoff letter." Likewise, the VA's payment of maintenance fees, late fees, and interest assessed from February 2015 to September 2015 does not establish that the VA would also pay assessments in the form of attorneys' fees and costs. Put another way, the AOAO's payment of maintenance fees, late fees, and interest does not amount to an intentional relinquishment of its right to contest payment of the subject attorneys' fees and costs. The AOAO argues that assessment for attorneys' fees and costs are no different from any other type of assessment against the Unit and should have been paid at closing. However, the AOAO

    offers no legal authority in support. Accordingly, the AOAO 
fails to show that the VA's conduct constituted a waiver of any objections to paying assessments for the attorneys' fees and costs incurred by AOAO. Coon , 98 Hawai #i at 261, 47 P.3d 
at 
376. 
(B) I
n its second point of error, the AOAO asserts 
that the Circuit Court erred in denying its Reconsideration Motion. Beyond this, the AOAO provides no further argument as to how or why the Circuit Court abused its discretionโthe appropriate standard of review, Cho v. State of Hawai #i, 115 
Ha
wai #i 373, 381, 168 P.3d 17, 25 (2007) ( quoting Ass'n of 
Apartment Owners of Wailea Elua v. Wailea Resort Co. , 100 
Hawai #i 97, 110, 58 P.3d 608, 621 (2002) ("The trial court's 
ruling on a motion for reconsideration is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard."))โin denying its motion. We therefore decline to address the matter further. See Kakinami 
v. Kak
inami , 127 Hawai #i 126, 144 n.16, 276 P.3d 695, 713 n.16 
(2
012) (citing In re Guardianship of Carlsmith , 113 Hawai #i 
236, 246, 151 P.3d 717, 727 (2007) (noting that this court may "disregard a particular contention if the appellant makes no discernible argument in support of that position"). 
Accordingly, the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in 
denying AOAO's Reconsideration Motion.
