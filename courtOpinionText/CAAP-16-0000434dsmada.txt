Industrial Relations Appeals Board's (the LIRAB)  April 28, 2016
"Order Denying Motion to Dismiss Appeal" (hereinafter referred to
 as "the April 28, 2016 order"), because the April 28, 2016 order
 is not an independently appealable order.
 
Pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 386-88
 
(2015) and HRS § 91-14(a) (2012 & Supp. 2015), an aggrieved party
 may appeal a final decision and order by the LIRAB directly to
 the Hawai
'i Intermediate Court of Appeals: 
The appeal of a decision or order of the LIRAB is
governed by HRS § 91-14(a), the statute authorizing appeals
in administrative agency cases. HRS § 91-14(a) authorizes
judicial review of a final decision and order in a contested
case or a preliminary ruling of the nature that deferral of
review pending entry of a subsequent final decision would
deprive appellant of adequate relief. For purposes of HRS §
91-14(a), we have defined "final order" to mean an order
ending the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be
accomplished. . . . Consequently, an order is not final if
the rights of a party involved remain undetermined or if the
matter is retained for further action.

 We note that Appellees' motion was miscoded as "Other" rather than
a "Motion" when filed in the Judiciary Electronic Information System, which
lead to the delay in considering this motion.

Board (the LIRAB) appears to be composed of Chair Danny J. Vasconcellos,
Member Melanie S. Matsui and Member Marie C. Laderta.

Bocalbos v. Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children, 89 
Hawai'i 436, 439, 974 P.2d 1026, 1029 (1999) (citation and some 
internal quotation marks omitted). The April 28, 2016 order did not end the proceedings before the LIRAB and leave nothing further to be accomplished. According to the record on appeal, the LIRAB has yet to enter a final order that finally adjudicates the substantive issues in Appellees' administrative appeal in case number AB 2016-086, which is still pending before the LIRAB. Therefore, the April 28, 2016 order is not an appealable final order under HRS § 386-88 and HRS § 91-14(a). Although exceptions to the final order requirement exist under Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848) (the Forgay doctrine) and the collateral order doctrine, the April 28, 2016 order does not satisfy all the requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine or the collateral order doctrine. See Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai
'i 18, 
20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) (regarding the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai
'i 319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 
(1998) (regarding the three requirements for appealability under the collateral order doctrine). Absent an appealable final decision and order by the LIRAB, we lack jurisdiction over this appeal. Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellees' August 16, 2016

 
motion for permission to file a reply memorandum in support of
 their August 6, 2016 motion to dismiss appellate court case
 number CAAP-16-0000434 for lack of appellate jurisdiction is
 granted.
