IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
DP, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
JP, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(FC-D NO. 14-1-0175)

 
MEMORANDIM OPINION
 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, and Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
This appeal arises from divorce proceedings between
 
Defendant-Appellant, JP ("Father"), and Plaintiff-Appellee, DP
 
("Mother"). Father appeals from the May 3, 2016 Divorce Decree
 that was issued by the Family Court of the Third Circuit ("Family
 
1/
Court"),  which dissolved the marriage of Mother and Father,
awarded sole legal and physical custody of the couple's two

 
children (collectively, the "Children") and related child support
 to Mother, and ordered the division and distribution of the
 couple's property and debts. We dismiss the portion of Father's
 appeal regarding division and distribution of property for lack
 of appellate jurisdiction, vacate and remand the portions of the
 Divorce Decree regarding child support and attorneys' fees and
 costs, and affirm the Divorce Decree in all other respects.
 
I. BACKGROUND

 
Mother and Father were married on September 9, 2011, in
 
Kailua-Kona, and together had the Children. Mother and Father
 
1/
 The Honorable Lloyd Van De Car presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
each have a child from prior relationships. Father is an airline 
pilot and Mother was unemployed at the time of the trial. Mother, the Children, and Mother's child ("Third Child") reside in the marital residence in Pahoa, Hawai
'i, while Father lives 
with his parents in Eagle River, Alaska. 
Mother and Father separated on June 15, 2014, and
 
Mother filed the Complaint for Divorce on June 20, 2014. 
Mother's complaint requested sole legal and physical custody of
 the Children and spousal support.
 
On October 8, 2014, the Family Court issued an Order
 
Listing Real Property for Sale, and an Order Regarding Inspection
 of Residence and Storage Locker, which granted Father's motion to
 list the marital residence for sale at fair market value, and to
 access the marital residence to retrieve his personal property.
 On December 1, 2014, the Family Court ordered Father to "advance
 $5,000.00 for legal fees and costs to [Mother]'s attorney[.]"
 Father failed to advance the money and, on April 27, 2015, the
 Family Court ordered that a judgment be entered against Father
 for $5,000.00.
 
The Family Court held a trial to address child custody,
 
spousal support, child support, and the division of marital
 assets and debts. On March 11, 2016, the Family Court issued its
 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Decision of the Court
 ("FOFs/COLs/DOC"). On May 3, 2016, the Family Court issued the
 Divorce Decree which dissolved the couple's marriage, awarded
 sole physical and legal custody of the Children to Mother, and
 ordered monthly child support in the amount of $2,977.00, did not
 award spousal support, and divided and distributed most of the
 couple's property and debts. Father timely appealed.
 
II. POINTS OF ERROR
 
On appeal, Father alleges that the Family Court erred
 
by: (1) failing to award joint physical and legal custody of the
 
Children and by failing to order a detailed visitation plan; (2)
 awarding child support in excess of 100% of the declared support
 needs of the Children and by failing to find that exceptional
 circumstances justified deviation from the child support
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
calculation; (3) failing to credit Father for 50% of the value of
 
his personal property left at the marital home; (4) failing to
 credit Father for at least 50% of the mortgage payment when it
 specifically found that there were no valid and relevant
 considerations to deviate from marital partnership principles;
 (5) failing to credit Father for his payments on the automobile
 loan; (6) failing to credit Father for the value of household
 items that he paid for that were left in the marital residence;
 (7) awarding Mother excessive attorneys' fees; and (8) failing to
 correct "confusing language" in the Divorce Decree. 
III. 
STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
Family Court Decisions
 
Generally, the family court possesses wide discretion
in making its decisions and those decisions will not
be set aside unless there is a manifest abuse of
 discretion. Thus, we will not disturb the family
court's decision on appeal unless the family court
disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to
the substantial detriment of a party litigant and its
decision clearly exceeded the bounds of reason.
 
Kakinami v. Kakinami, 127 Hawai' i 126, 136, 276 P.3d 695,
705 (2012) (quoting Fisher v. Fisher, 111 Hawai' i 41, 46,
137 P.3d 355, 360 (2006)). 
It is well established that a family court abuses its
discretion where “(1) the family court disregarded
rules or principles of law or practice to the
substantial detriment of a party litigant; (2) the
family court failed to exercise its equitable
discretion; or (3) the family court's decision clearly
exceeds the bounds of reason.”
 
Id. at 155–56, 276 P.3d at 724–25 (emphasis omitted)

437, 444[ n.6] (1994)). 
Hamilton v. Hamilton, 138 Hawai 'i 185, 197, 378 P.3d 901, 913 
(2016). "Furthermore, '[t]he burden of establishing abuse of
 
discretion is on appellant, and a strong showing is required to
 establish it.'" Ek v. Boggs, 102 Hawai
'i 289, 294-95, 75 P.3d 
1180, 1185-86 (2003) (quoting Lepere v. United Pub. Workers,

Findings of Fact/Conclusions of Law
 
The family court's FOFs are reviewed on appeal
under the "clearly erroneous" standard. A FOF is
 clearly erroneous when (1) the record lacks
substantial evidence to support the finding, or (2)
despite substantial evidence in support of the
finding, the appellate court is nonetheless left with
a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been
 made. "Substantial evidence" is credible evidence
 which is of sufficient quality and probative value to
enable a person of reasonable caution to support a
conclusion.
 
On the other hand, the family court's COLs are
reviewed on appeal de novo, under the right/wrong
standard. COLs, consequently, are "not binding upon
an appellate court and are freely reviewable for their
correctness."
 
. . . .
 
Moreover, the family court is given much leeway
in its examination of the reports concerning a child's
care, custody, and welfare, and its conclusions in
this regard, if supported by the record and not
clearly erroneous, must stand on appeal.

IV. DISCUSSION
 
A. Property division
 
As a preliminary matter, this court lacks jurisdiction
 
to review the portions of the Divorce Decree pertaining to the
 division and distribution of property. Thus, we cannot address
 Father's points of error 3, 4, 5, and 6.
 
Hawaii divorce cases involve a maximum of four
discrete parts: (1) dissolution of the marriage; (2) child
custody, visitation, and support; (3) spousal support; and
(4) division and distribution of property and debts. Black
 v. Black, 6 Haw.App. 493, 728 P.2d 1303 (1986). In Cleveland
 v. Cleveland, 57 Haw. 519, 559 P.2d 744 (1977), the Hawaii
Supreme Court held that an order which finally decides parts
(1) and (4) is final and appealable even if part (2) remains
undecided. Although we recommend that, except in
exceptionally compelling circumstances, all parts be decided
 
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
 
simultaneously and that part (1) not be finally decided
prior to a decision on all the other parts, we conclude that
an order which finally decides part (1) is final and
appealable when decided even if parts (2), (3), and (4)
remain undecided; that parts (2), (3), and (4) are each
separately final and appealable as and when they are
decided, but only if part (1) has previously or
simultaneously been decided; and that if parts (2), (3),
and/or (4) have been decided before part (1) has been
finally decided, they become final and appealable when part
(1) is finally decided.
 
Eaton v. Eaton, 7 Haw. App. 111, 118-19, 748 P.2d 801, 805 (App.
 
1987) (determining that this court lacked jurisdiction over a
 portion of the appeal because the family court expressly left the
 distribution and division of personal property to the parties,
 despite the fact that the parties had proven themselves incapable
 of doing so on their own).
 
Here, parts 1, 2, and 3 of the Divorce Decree, which
 
address the dissolution of the marriage; child custody,
 visitation, and support; and spousal support, respectively, are
 final and appealable. Part 4, however, is not final and
 appealable because the Family Court has not fully and finally
 divided and distributed all of the property and debts of Mother
 and Father over which it had jurisdiction.
 
In both the Divorce Decree and FOFs/COLs/DOC, the
 
Family Court stated that the jointly owned household furniture
 and equipment at the marital residence should be divided equally
 between the parties by mutual agreement. While the Family Court
 calculated the value of the household goods, entered the value on
 the Property Division Chart, and divided the total equally
 between Mother and Father, the Family Court did not expressly or
 implicitly divide and distribute the household goods and
 furnishings of the parties. Rather, even when faced with the
 expressed inability and unwillingness of Mother and Father to do
 so on their own, the Family Court left the division of the
 household goods and furnishings to Mother and Father. Father's
 points of error include contentions that the Family Court failed
 to credit him for 50% of the value of personal property left at
 the residence, and for the value of household items he paid for
 that were left at the residence. Accordingly, this court does
 not have appellate jurisdiction to review the Divorce Decree as
 
5
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
to the division of property and debts, credit for personal
 
property, or the value of household items personally paid for
 that were left at the residence. Hamilton v. Hamilton, No. CAAP­
14-0000519, 2014 WL 2198378, at *2 (Haw. Ct. App. May 27, 2014)
 (noting that even if the family court decided part 1, it did not
 decide part 4 of the divorce case by fully dividing and
 distributing all of the property and debts, and thus it was not
 eligible for appellate review under Eaton). Thus, we dismiss the
 appeal with regard to the division and distribution of property
 and debts.
 
B. Child custody and visitation
 In Father's first point of error, he claims that "[t]he
 
Family Court erred in [its] decision and divorce decree by
 failing to award the parties joint physical and legal custody and
 by failing to order a detailed visitation plan addressing the
 family needs as sought by [Father]." Father "strongly disagrees
 with the findings of the court . . . that due to the 'level of
 conflict' between the parties the best interests of the
 [C]hildren are served by awarding [Mother] sole legal and
 physical custody of the [C]hildren[,] and argues that the finding
 is not supported by the record and is an abuse of discretion." 
Father instead contends that it would be in the Children's best
 interest for the Family Court to adopt his comprehensive
 parenting plan. Having closely reviewed the record, including
 Father's parenting plan, we conclude that the Family Court did
 not abuse its discretion in its custody ruling.
 
The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has held that "[t]he 
determination of the care, custody and control of a minor child in a divorce proceeding is peculiarly within the wide discretionary power of the trial court whose paramount consideration is the welfare of the minor child." Crow v. Crow, 
49 Haw. 258, 261, 414 P.2d 82, 85 (1966). In determining what constitutes the best interest of the child under Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") section 571-46 (Supp. 2014), the Family Court is directed to consider "[t]he areas and levels of conflict present within the family[.]" Haw. Rev. Stat. § 571-46(b)(15). 
Here, in its COLs, the Family Court identified the
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
enumerated considerations provided in HRS section 571-46 for
 
2/
 determining best interests of the Children. In COL 8 , the 
Family Court determined that "[n]either parent has been
 
cooperative in developing and implementing a plan to meet the
 needs of the children[,]" that "there is now and likely to
 continue substantial conflict between the parents concerning what
 is best for the children, what level of financial support ought
 to be awarded, and how best to move forward with their and their
 children's lives[,]" that "because [Mother] has spent more time
 with and caring for the children prior to and after the
 separation of the parties, she has established and maintained a
 better overall relationship with both of the children[,]" and
 that Mother "is meeting the physical health, emotional, safety
 and educational needs of the children[.]" Father does not
 contest COL 8, and COL 8 is "sufficiently comprehensive and
 pertinent to the issues to disclose to this court the steps by
 which [the family court] reached its ultimate conclusion on each
 factual issue." Doe v. Roe, 5 Haw. App. 558, 566, 705 P.2d 535,
 
543 (App. 1985) (citing Nani Koolau Co. v. K & M. Constr. Inc., 5
 Haw. App. 137, 140, 681 P.2d 580,, 584 (1984)). COL 8 indicates
 that the Family Court considered the requirements of HRS section
 571-46(b) in determining the best interests of the Children, and
 supports COL 9, which determined that sole physical and legal
 custody of the Children be awarded to Mother due to the level of
 conflict between the parties. See MHL v. HJKL , No. CAAP-14­
0000697, 2016 WL 806200, at *3-4 (Haw. Ct. App. Mar. 1, 2016)
 (noting that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it
 granted mother sole legal and physical custody because of 
continued disagreements about timesharing). 
Father attacks the credibility determinations made by
 
the Family Court. It is well settled, however, that "[t]he
 appellate courts will give due deference to the right of the
 
2/
 COL 8 appears to contain findings of fact, rather than conclusions
of law. "[A] trial court's denomination of a FOF or a COL is not
determinative of the standard of review to be applied on appeal." Schiller v. 
Schiller, 120 Hawai' i 283, 301, 205 P.3d 548, 566 (App. 2009) (citing Crosby 
v. State Dep't of Budget & Fin., 76 Hawai' i 332, 340, 876 P.2d 1300, 1308
(1994)). 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
trier of fact 'to determine credibility, weigh the evidence, and 
draw reasonable inferences from the evidence adduced.'" In re 
Doe, 107 Hawai 'i 12, 19, 108 P.3d 966, 973 (2005) (quoting State 
v. Lubong, 77 Hawai 'i 429, 432, 886 P.2d 766, 769 (App. 1994)). 
Therefore, this court declines to weigh the evidence and address credibility as Father requests. 
Father fails to demonstrate that the Family Court

 
abused its discretion in awarding sole legal and physical custody
 of the Children to Mother, subject to Father's visitation, and
 accordingly we find none. Furthermore, Father has not provided
 any specific argument relating to the Family Court's ruling on
 visitation other than the argument addressed in Section E below.
 
C. Child support
 Father's second argument on appeal is that "[t]he 
Family Court erred in [its] decision, decree and order for income assignment . . . by awarding child support in excess of 100% of the declared support needs of the [C]hildren and by failing to find the existence of exceptional circumstances justifying deviation from the child support calculation." Father asserts that the amount of child support awarded to Mother exceeds the declared needs of the Children, and that the Family Court included Third Child's needs in its calculations for child support owed by Father. Father also argues that the Family Court erroneously included Mother and Third Child's needs into the amount of child support necessary to determine the appropriate standard of living of the Children. Father contests FOF 27, COL 11, COL 18, and DOC 3, and relies on Matsunaga v. Matsunaga, 99 Hawai
'i 157, 53 P.3d 296 (App. 2002) to support his argument. 
Father's argument has merit. 
As authorized under HRS section 576D-7(a) (2006), the 
Hawai'i Child Support Guidelines set forth criteria for 
establishing the proper amount of child support. HRS section 571-52.5 (2006) requires that the Family Court use the Child Support Guidelines Worksheet ("CSG Worksheet") to calculate support awards "except when exceptional circumstances warrant departure." Haw. Rev. Stat. § 571-52.5. The Hawai
'i Supreme 
Court recently stated that 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
 
the family court was first required to utilize the
Guidelines Worksheet and compute a support amount. Only
after determining the support amount using the Guidelines
Worksheet may the court consider whether exceptional
circumstances permit deviation from that amount. If the
 court concludes that such circumstances exist, it must then
make findings of fact with respect to both the support
amount determined by the Guidelines Worksheet and the
exceptional circumstance(s) that would justify deviation
from this amount.
 
P.O. v. J.S., 139 Hawai 'i 434, 444, 393 P.3d 986, 996 (2017). 
This court presumes that "the amount of child support necessary 
to fund the appropriate standard of living is the total amount computed according to Parts I, II, and III [of the CSG Worksheet]." Matsunaga, 99 Hawai
'i at 167, 53 P.3d at 306. 
It is the burden of the party alleging the 'exceptional
circumstance' to prove that the amount of child support
necessary to fund the appropriate standard of living is less
than the total amount computed according to Parts I, II, and
III of the [CSG Worksheet] and to prove how much less.
 
Id. Further in Matsunaga, this court determined that "'[a]n
 
unusually high monthly income that would result in a computation
 higher than the reasonable needs of the children' is one
 'exceptional circumstance' warranting departure." Id. at 166, 53
 
P.3d at 305 (quoting Richardson v. Richardson, 8 Haw. App. 446,
 457, 808 P.2d 1279, 1286 (1991)).
 
In order for Father to prove such,
 
the three questions of fact that must be answered are: (1)
What is the appropriate standard of living? (2) What is the
total cost of the children's reasonable needs at the
 appropriate standard of living? (3) If the answer to
question (2) is less than the total amount computed
according to Parts I and II of the [CSG Worksheet], then the
case involves an exceptional circumstance.
 
Richardson, 8 Haw. App. at 457, 808 P.2d at 1287. In Richardson,
 
we instructed the family court to look at the following to
 determine a child's appropriate standard of living: "(a) the
 parents' prior financial situation; (b) the custodial parent's
 current financial situation; and (c) the noncustodial parent's
 current financial situation[.]" Id. at 458, 808 P.2d 1279, 1287. 
Here, the Family Court used the CSG Worksheet to
 
calculate the child support award. Father does not contest FOF
 5, which states that his gross monthly income is $13,808, or
 contend that FOF 15 is incorrect when it imputes $2,080 a month
 as Mother's income. Although Father asserts that the Family
 
9
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Court erred when it added Third Child's needs into the CSG 
Worksheet calculations, the CSG Worksheet reflects that the Family Court calculated the child support award based only on the Children. Accordingly, the Family Court did not err in calculating the amount of child support based on the gross monthly income of the parties on the CSG Worksheet. Jacoby v. 
Jacoby, 134 Hawai
'i 431, 446, 341 P.3d 1231, 1246 (App. 2014) 
(noting child support obligations are based in part on the monthly gross incomes of the parents); Matsunaga, 99 Hawai
'i at 
167, 53 P.3d at 306 (determining that "[p]resumptively, the amount of child support necessary to fund the appropriate standard of living is the total amount computed according to Parts I, II, and III of the [CSG Worksheet]"). 
However, Father is correct that the Family Court abused
 
its discretion in determining the answer to the ancillary
 question of whether there were exceptional circumstances
 warranting deviation from the CSG Worksheet when calculating
 child support. Although the Family Court explicitly stated in
 COL 11 that it "exclud[ed] the expenses attributed to [Mother's]
 older child[,]" and the court appears to have done so with regard
 to the Children's personal monthly expense total on Mother's
 Income and Expense Statement, the Family Court erred when it
 concluded that "[t]here are no exceptional circumstances [that]
 exist warranting a deviation from the Child Support Guidelines. 
Including [Mother's] shelter care costs, but excluding the
 expenses attributed to [Third Child], her need exceeds [Father's]
 child support obligation as determined by the [CSG] Worksheet." 
Mother's shelter care costs should not be considered in
 
determining whether an exceptional circumstance warrants a
 deviation from the CSG Worksheet when calculating child support. 
Cf. Richardson, 8 Haw. App. at 458-59, 808 P.2d at 1287 (noting
 that the amount of child support awarded "does not fund the
 children's share of mother's monthly expenses for housing, car,
 and utilities"); Jane Doe VI, v. Richard Roe VI, 6 Haw. App. 629,
 641, 736 P.2d 448, 456–57 (1987) (prior to the implementation of
 the CSG worksheet, this court noted that "[t]he court must be
 cognizant of the fact that to raise the mother's standard of
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
living through the vehicle of child support would constitute the 
imposition of an unauthorized obligation on part of the father toward the mother." (quoting Kathy G.J. v. Arnold D., 501 N.Y.S.2d 58, 64 (N.Y. App. Div. 1986)) (internal quotation marks and original brackets omitted)); but see Child Support Enforcement Agency v. Doe, 98 Hawai
'i 58, 69, 41 P.3d 720, 731 
(App. 2001) (this court concluding that there was no abuse of discretion even though the family court's child support award of $1,430 was $873 more than the child's actual monthly personal expenses, and $327 more than all of his share of the actual monthly expenses put together). 
Therefore, the Family Court abused its discretion in

 
including the expenses of Mother in determining whether an
 exceptional circumstance existed to warrant a deviation from the
 CSG Worksheet calculation. We do not reach the question of
 whether the Family Court erred in the result that it reached, but
 only that it reached that result while incorporating an
 extraneous factor in its analysis.
 
D. Attorneys' fees and costs
 In his seventh point of error, Father asserts that
 
"[t]he Family Court erred in [its] decision and decree by
 awarding wife excessive attorney's fees without an adequate
 factual basis and as such the award constitutes an abuse of
 discretion." In light of our decisions on the issues above, this
 court is unable to conclude whether the award of attorneys' fees
 and costs is just and equitable under HRS section 580-47(a). 
E. Confusing language/attached documents.
 Father contends in his eighth point of error that
 
"[t]he Family Court erred in the language of the divorce decree
 by failing to correct confusing language." Father provides no
 legal support for his contention that this is error, and instead
 asserts that the Family Court failed to attach Exhibits "A" and
 "B" to the Divorce Decree, and thus Father was left to guess. 
Father appears to misunderstand part of the instructions of the
 Divorce Decree.
 
11
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Father points to paragraph 3 of the Divorce Decree,
 
which states the following, in relevant part:
 
3. The Plaintiff is awarded sole legal and physical
custody of the parties' minor children.  Defendant shall be
 
awarded reasonable visitation with the minor children as
 outlined in #10 of the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law
and Decision of the Court; Exhibit "A" and "B" filed on
March 11, 2016.
 
This reference is not confusing as it clearly refers to the
 
FOF/COL/DOC to which Exhibits A and B are attached. 
Father is correct that the Family Court did not attach
 
the CSG Worksheet as Exhibit A as is stated in paragraph 4 of the
 Divorce Decree. Although the failure to attach an Exhibit A to
 the Divorce Decree might create some confusion, the CSG Worksheet
 can easily be found attached as Exhibit A to the FOF/COL/DOC,
 which is plainly stated in paragraph 3. Thus, the Family Court's
 failure to attach the CSG Worksheet to the Divorce Decree is
 harmless. 
V. DISPOSITION
 
Based on the foregoing, we dismiss Father's appeal
 
regarding division and distribution of property for lack of
 
appellate jurisdiction; vacate the portions of the Divorce Decree
 with respect to child support, and attorneys' fees and costs, and
 remand to the Family Court for further proceedings. We affirm
 the May 3, 2016 Divorce Decree in all other respects.
