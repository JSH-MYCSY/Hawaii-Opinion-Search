IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
IN THE INTEREST OF R CHILDREN
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-S NO. 14-00025)
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Ginoza, C.J., and Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Father-Appellant appeals from the "Order Terminating
 
Parental Rights of Father [] and Order Regarding Insufficient
 
Basis, Currently, to Terminate Parental Rights of Mother [],
 filed on May 23, 2016 ("Order Terminating Parental Rights") in
 the Family Court of the First Circuit ("Family Court"),
1 which
 
terminated Father's, but not Mother's, parental rights to their
 child, KK. 
The Family Court concluded that Petitioner-Appellee 
State of Hawai' i, Department of Human Services ("DHS") failed to 
prove by clear and convincing evidence that Mother was not presently willing and able to provide KK with a safe family home, even with the assistance of a service plan, or that it was not reasonably foreseeable that Mother would become willing and able to provide KK with a safe family home, even with the assistance of a service plan, within a reasonable period of time. The Family Court also held that the proposed permanent plan of adoption was not in the best interest of KK.

However, the Family Court found that DHS had proven by
 
clear and convincing evidence that Father was not presently
 
willing and able to provide KK with a safe family home, even with
 the assistance of a service plan, and that it was not reasonably
 foreseeable that Father would become willing and able to provide
 KK with a safe family home, even with the assistance of a service
 plan, within a reasonable period of time. The Family Court
 further found that it was in KK's best interest that Father's
 parental rights be terminated.
 
On appeal, Father specifically challenges FOFs 16, 17,
 
23, 76, 81, 82, 83, and 86 and COLs 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 14. 
Father contends that: (A) the failure of the Family Court to
 terminate both Mother's and Father's parental rights demonstrates
 that the statutory provisions of Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS")
 § 587A-33 were not followed; and (B) there was not clear and
 convincing evidence that Father was not willing and able to
 provide a safe family home to KK or that it was not reasonably
 foreseeable that Father would become willing and able to provide
 a safe family home to KK, with the assistance of a service plan,
 within a reasonable period of time. 
For the reasons explained below, we affirm.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
Mother has six children: NR, AR, KR1, JR, KR2, and KK. 
Adult JR is the father of NR, AR, KR1, JR, and KR2. Father is
 the father of KK. On February 18, 2014, DHS filed a Petition for
 Family Supervision over NR, AR, JR, KR2, and KK (collectively,
 "Children"), but not KR1 who was already in the care of his
 maternal grandparents. Father's parental rights to another child
 with a different mother were terminated in a prior proceeding,
 FC-S No. 05-10503. DHS alleged that the Children were subject to
 harm or threatened harm by Father. On August 29, 2013, DHS was
 informed that Father kicked JR in the chest causing JR pain and
 abrasions and then punched Mother in the head when she attempted
 to pick up JR. Father was arrested, but Mother failed to obtain
 a temporary restraining order ("TRO") against Father so the case
 was returned from Voluntary Case Management due to non-compliance
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
in December 2013. DHS alleged that Father used alcohol,
 
marijuana and crystal methamphetamine. In February 2014, Mother
 obtained a TRO against Father in FC-DA No. 14-1-0309 and a
 hearing was scheduled for February 24, 2014. DHS believed that
 Mother could not provide sufficient supervision of the Children
 to protect them from substantial or imminent harm, there was an
 extensive history of domestic violence in Mother's and Father's
 relationship, Adult JR was also physically abusive to Mother,
 Father and Adult JR had convictions for abuse of a household
 member, and Mother lacked the capacity to protect the Children. 
In an order filed on February 24, 2014, Mother and
 
Father were ordered to follow a service plan dated February 18,
 2014 ("February 2014 Service Plan"). The February 2014 Service
 Plan required Mother to participate in a psychological
 evaluation, domestic violence and anger management education,
 parenting and individual counseling, and enhanced healthy start
 services. Father was required to participate in a substance
 abuse assessment and recommended treatment; random drug screening
 when instructed; domestic violence and anger management
 education; a psychological evaluation; and parenting, individual,
 couples and domestic violence counseling. 
An April 7, 2014 assessment report from Hina Mauka
 
indicated that Father tested presumptive positive for
 methamphetamine and admitted that his last use of methamphetamine
 was on March 29, 2014, several days before the assessment and
 drug screening on April 1, 2014.
 
On April 11, 2014, DHS filed a Motion for Immediate
 
Review to Change Family Supervision to Foster Custody. In an
 April 7, 2014 Short Report to Court, DHS alleged that the agreed-
upon plan for maternal grandmother to move in with Mother was not
 being followed because Mother was evicted from her apartment, so
 Mother and the Children moved in with maternal grandmother and
 step-grandfather instead. However, maternal step-grandfather had
 a prior conviction for sexual assault and DHS was concerned about
 leaving the Children alone with step-grandfather. Mother
 continued to have contact with Father and forced all of the
 Children to go with her when she met with Father. The Children
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
stated that they did not feel safe when around Father. On
 
April 14, 2014, family supervision was revoked and DHS was
 awarded temporary foster custody over the Children. 
In an order filed on April 24, 2014, the Family Court
 
found that Adult JR made progress but Mother and Father made only
 minimal progress in resolving the issues that necessitated
 placement. Mother and Father stipulated to follow a modified
 service plan dated April 10, 2014 ("April 2014 Service Plan"). 
The April 2014 Service Plan required Mother to participate in a
 substance abuse assessment and recommended treatment and to do
 random drug screening in addition to the tasks required in the
 February 2014 Service Plan. The April 2014 Service Plan added
 intensive outpatient care for substance abuse for Father in
 addition to the prior required services in the February 2014
 Service Plan.
2
 
In a Safe Family Home Report, dated September 5, 2014,
 
DHS reported that Father was making minimal progress in services
 but he completed a psychological evaluation and substance abuse
 assessment. Father tested positive three times for drugs and had
 six no shows which resulted in removal from the monitoring
 program. DHS treats any no show for a drug screen as a
 presumptive positive result. Father also attended parenting
 class but was removed after missing four classes. DHS reported
 that Father had ongoing domestic violence and anger management
 issues and failed to address his domestic violence issues. 
In an order dated October 9, 2014, the Family Court
 
found that Adult JR and Mother had made progress in resolving the
 problems that necessitated placement, but that Father had made
 minimal progress. Therefore, Mother and Father were ordered to
 follow a service plan dated September 5, 2014 ("September 2014
 Service Plan"). The September 2014 Service Plan was similar to
 the April 2014 Service Plan.
 In an order dated November 10, 2014, the Family Court
 
ordered that Mother and Father follow a service plan, dated

 We deem the references to Adult JR in the "Expected Changes"
detail of each task in the section of the April 2014 Service Plan that
pertains to Father to be typographical errors.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
October 20, 2014 ("October 2014 Service Plan") which was fairly
 
similar to the September 2014 Service Plan. 
In a Report Update to Court dated February 4, 2015, DHS
 
reported that Father's drug test on December 2, 2014, was
 positive for methamphetamine, Father failed to show up for a drug
 test on December 8, 2014 which was a presumptive positive drug
 test result, Father tested positive for methamphetamine on
 December 22, 2014, and on January 3, 2015, Father again failed to
 show up for a drug test which is a presumptive positive drug test
 result. DHS stated that it did not believe that Mother and
 Father were demonstrating change in domestic violence since there
 were numerous reports to DHS of an argument between Mother and
 Father at Tamura's Supermarket in Waianae. 
In a Short Report to Court dated May 25, 2015, DHS
 
reported that Father was a no show for drug testing on March 3,
 April 26, and May 16, 2015. 
On July 23, 2015, DHS filed a motion to terminate the
 
parental rights of Mother and Father and award permanent custody
 of KK to the DHS with the proposed permanent plan calling for
 adoption of KK.
 
In an order dated August 10, 2015, the Family Court
 
ordered Mother and Father to follow the service plan dated
 July 10, 2015, which was similar to the October 2014 Service Plan
 and indicates the status of each service.
 
Hina Mauka drug testing reports indicated that Father
 
was a no-show on August 21 and 25, 2015, and was removed from the
 program. Father was re-referred for monitoring services on
 September 1, 2015, but was a no-show on September 27 and
 October 3, 2015 and was again terminated from the program. 
Meanwhile, a letter from Child & Family Service dated
 September 21, 2015, indicated that they were closing Father's
 case for domestic violence services due to his lack of
 participation. Furthermore, after being re-referred for
 monitoring services on November 16, 2015, a Hina Mauka drug test
 report indicated that on November 18, 2015, Father was a no-show.
 
A Safe Family Home Report dated November 23, 2015,
 
stated that Father failed to enroll himself in outpatient
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
educational classes as recommended in his substance abuse
 
assessment and it was unclear that Father showed insight into his
 domestic violence issues because of his ongoing off and on
 relationship with Mother and nonparticipation after re-referral
 for services. 
On March 8, 2016, the Family Court began hearings on
 
the motion to terminate parental rights. Annette Shanks
 testified that she was a social worker for DHS. Shanks was first
 assigned to KK's case on October 3, 2014. Shanks stated that
 Father was re-referred for drug monitoring services but was
 recently removed from it on March 4, 2016, for two no-shows. 
Shanks testified that DHS does not believe that Mother
 
or Father can provide a safe family home even with the assistance
 of a service plan. Shanks stated that Mother had a history of
 domestic violence with a conviction for abuse of a family or
 household member, was abused by her stepfather, and witnessed
 abuse of her own mother. Father was also convicted of abuse of a
 family or household member. He also used alcohol, marijuana, and
 crystal methamphetamine. In addition, Father also had domestic
 violence in his past involving his four other children. DHS has
 safety concerns about Father because of his noncompliance with
 the substance abuse assessment recommendation for outpatient
 education classes, inconsistent sobriety, and anger issues.
 Father had outbursts during meetings with Shanks when she
 reminded him about his services and about him being inconsistent
 with services, thus, DHS believed that there was some anger
 issues that need to be resolved. Father told Shanks that he did
 not want to participate in domestic violence services because he
 needed to work and support his children. Father also did not
 complete anger management classes. Father reported that he had a
 medical issue so he could not participate in the drug testing but
 failed to provide documentation of a medical issue that would
 have prevented him from participating in drug testing. Shanks
 reminded Father every month from 2014 to 2016 about classes, and
 despite agreeing to participate, Father did not do so. Father
 completed individual counseling, but couples counseling was
 incomplete due to domestic violence issues. It was Shanks'
 
6
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
opinion that Father was not presently willing and able to provide
 
a safe family home, even with the assistance of a service plan,
 and that it was not reasonably foreseeable that he would become
 willing and able to provide a safe family home, even with the
 assistance of a service plan, because Father was not compliant
 with recommendations made by DHS and had not shown interest in
 resolving the safety factors that DHS had concerns about. 
In FOF 95, the Family Court found that Shanks was 
credible. "It is well-settled that an appellate court will not pass upon issues dependent upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence; this is the province of the trier of fact." Fisher v. Fisher, 111 Hawai' i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 
(2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
On May 23, 2016, the Family Court entered its Order
 
Terminating Parental Rights, which terminated Father's parental
 rights to KK under HRS § 587A-33(a), but did not terminate
 Mother's parental rights to KK and found that the permanent plan
 for adoption was not in the best interest of the child. On
 December 1, 2016, the Family Court issued its Findings of Fact
 and Conclusions of Law.
 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
Family Court Decisions
 
Generally, the family court possesses wide discretion
in making its decisions and those decisions will not be set
aside unless there is a manifest abuse of discretion. Thus,
we will not disturb the family court's decisions on appeal
unless the family court disregarded rules or principles of
law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party
litigant and its decision clearly exceeded the bounds of
reason.
 
Fisher v. Fisher, 111 Hawai' i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 (2006) 
(quoting In re Doe, 95 Hawai' i 183, 189-90, 20 P.3d 616, 622-23 
(2001)). 
Family Court's Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law
 
The family court's FOFs are reviewed on appeal
under the "clearly erroneous" standard. A FOF is clearly
erroneous when (1) the record lacks substantial evidence
to support the finding, or (2) despite substantial
evidence in support of the finding, the appellate court
is nonetheless left with a definite and firm conviction
 that a mistake has been made. "Substantial evidence" is
 credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and
 
7
   
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
probative value to enable a person of reasonable caution
to support a conclusion.
 
On the other hand, the family court's COLs are
reviewed on appeal de novo, under the right/wrong
standard. COLs, consequently, are "not binding upon an
appellate court and are freely reviewable for their
correctness.["]
 
. . . .
 
Moreover, the family court is given much leeway in
its examination of the reports concerning a child's
care, custody, and welfare, and its conclusions in this
regard, if supported by the record and not clearly
erroneous, must stand on appeal.
 
Id. (quoting Doe, 95 Hawai' i at 190, 20 P.3d at 623). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
A.	 An award of permanent custody under HRS section
587A-33 involves essentially the same criteria and
material elements as termination of parental
rights under HRS section 571-61(b)(1)(E). 
Father contends that since the Family Court held that
 
the permanent plan was not in the best interest of KK and since
 
Mother's parental rights were not terminated, his parental rights
 may not be terminated pursuant to HRS § 587A-33 (Supp. 2015).
3
 
HRS § 587A-33 states in relevant part:
Termination of parental rights hearing.  (a) At a
termination of parental rights hearing, the court shall
determine whether there exists clear and convincing evidence
that:
 
(1)	 A child's parent whose rights are subject to
termination is not presently willing and able to
provide the parent's child with a safe family
 
3
 The Family Court concluded differently, holding that:
 
[T]he parental rights of "Parent 1" can be terminated where
there is clear and convincing evidence supporting the
termination of Parent 1's parental rights, while at the same
time, the parental rights of "Parent 2" could remain intact
because there is insufficient evidence to support the
termination of Parent 2's parental rights.
 
The Family Court noted that Father argued that "if Mother's parental rights
were not terminated then Father's parental rights should likewise not be
terminated," but "no one addressed the legal issue of whether parental rights
may be terminated individually." The court explained that it would have
welcomed the opportunity to consider such caselaw or statutory analysis, it
had explained its analysis "on numerous occasions" to the parties and that,
while "statements have been made that 'that's not how things are done,' no
legal basis, caselaw or statutory, has ever been presented . . . to support
the position that termination of parental rights can only take place for both
parents or not at all."

     NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
home, even with the assistance of a service
plan;
 
(2)	 It is not reasonably foreseeable that the
child's parent whose rights are subject to
termination will become willing and able to
provide the child with a safe family home, even
with the assistance of a service plan, within a
reasonable period of time, which shall not
exceed two years from the child's date of entry
into foster care;
 
(3)	 The proposed permanent plan is in the best
interests of the child. In reaching this
determination, the court shall:
 
(A)	 Presume that it is in the best interests
 
of the child to be promptly and
permanently placed with responsible and
competent substitute parents and family in
a safe and secure home; and
 
(B)	 Give greater weight to the presumption
that the permanent plan is in the child's
best interest, the younger the child is
upon the child's date of entry into foster
care; and
 
(4)	 The child consents to the permanent plan if the
child is at least fourteen years old, unless the
court consults with the child in camera and
 finds that it is in the best interest of the
 child to proceed without the child's consent.
 
(b) If the court determines that the criteria set
 
forth in subsection (a) are established by clear and
convincing evidence and the goal of the permanent plan is
for the child to be adopted or remain in permanent custody,
the court shall order:
 
(1)	 That the child's parent's parental rights be
terminated;
 
(2)	 Termination of the existing service plan and
revocation of the prior award of foster custody;
 
(3)	 That permanent custody of the child be awarded
to an appropriate authorized agency;
 
(4)	 An appropriate permanent plan; and
 
(5)	 The entry of any other orders the court deems to
be in the best interests of the child, including
restricting or excluding unnecessary parties
from participating in adoption or other
subsequent proceedings.
 
. . . .
 
(h) If the court determines that the criteria set
 
forth in subsection (a) are not established by clear and
convincing evidence, the court shall order:
 
(1)	 The preparation of a plan to achieve permanency
for the child;
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2)	 The entry of any orders that the court deems to
be in the best interests of the child;
 
(3)	 A periodic review hearing to be held within six
months after the date of the last permanency
hearing; and
 
(4)	 A permanency hearing to be held within twelve
months of the date of the last permanency
hearing.
 
A permanent plan shall "[s]tate whether the permanency
 
goal for the child will be achieved through adoption, legal
 
guardianship, or permanent custody[.]" Haw. Rev. Stat. § 587A­32(a)(1) (Supp. 2015). In this case, the permanent plan
 specified adoption as the permanent goal.
 
We agree that if all of the criteria under HRS section 
587A-33(a) are not met, then HRS section 587A-33(b) provides no basis for terminating Father's parental rights. Here, however, the termination criteria under chapter 587 (the predecessor chapter to 587A) and HRS section 571-61(b)(1)(E) are "essentially the same." In re Male Child Born on May 27, 1983, 8 Haw. App. 66, 72, 793 P.2d 669, 672 (1990). Furthermore, the Hawai' i Supreme 
Court has held that chapter 587 should be liberally construed to serve the best interest of the child. In re Doe, 84 Hawai' i 41, 
51–52, 928 P.2d 883, 893–94 (1996). 
The Child Protective Act was first enacted in 1983 by
 
Act 171 and was codified as HRS chapter 587. 1983 Haw. Sess.
 Laws Act 171, at 320-45. In 1986, Act 316 modified HRS chapter
 587 by enacting a new statutory provision, HRS section 587-73. 
1986 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 316, §30, at 662-64. 
The legislative history of Act 316 indicates that Act
 
316 was:
 
to provide for timely permanent planning by incorporating in
the Child Protective Act certain provisions of the
termination of parental rights statute (chapter 571, part
VI, HRS) , the adoption statute (chapter 578, HRS), and the
guardianship statute (chapter 560, part 4, HRS). Under
 present law, the required use of these separate proceedings
has resulted in confusion and unnecessary delays for
children and their families.
 
H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 236-86, in 1986 House Journal, at 1088 
(emphasis added).
 
The legislative history is clear that HRS chapter 587
 
was not intended to displace the provisions of HRS chapter 571,
 
10
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
but rather to incorporate its provisions into a unified 
proceeding. S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 537-86, in 1986 Senate Journal, at 1023. In In re Doe, 84 Hawai' i 41, 51-52, 928 P.2d 
883, 893-94 (1996), the supreme court recognized that HRS chapters 571 and 587 are not mutually exclusive by stating, "It would be absurd, therefore, to construe either chapter as implicitly limiting the ability of the family court to proceed under the other chapter." "Simply because an action is initiated as a chapter 571 proceeding should not preclude or limit the family court from addressing problems perceived as arising under chapter 587." Id. at 52, 928 P.2d at 894. The Family Court may 
take action under HRS chapter 587 regardless of whether the action was initiated under HRS chapter 571 or a formal petition pursuant to HRS chapter 587. Id. 
HRS section 571-61(b)(1)(E) provides that "[t]he family
 
courts may [involuntarily] terminate the parental rights in
 respect to any child as to any legal parent . . . [w]hose child
 has been removed from the parent's physical custody pursuant to
 legally authorized judicial action under section 571-11(9), and
 who is found to be unable to provide now and in the foreseeable
 future the care necessary for the well-being of the child[.]" 
The family court has exclusive original jurisdiction in
 proceedings "[f]or the protection of any child under chapter
 587A[.]" Haw. Rev. Stat. § 571-11(9) (Supp. 2015).
 
In In re Male Child Born on May 27, 1983, 8 Haw. App.
 
66, 72, 793 P.2d 669, 672 (1990), this court held that:
 
A comparison reveals that an award of permanent
custody under HRS chapter 587 (Supp. 1989) involves
essentially the same criteria and material elements as
a termination of parental rights under HRS § 571­61(b)(1)(E). That is why HRS § 571-61(b)(1)(E)
authorizes the termination of parental rights in most
cases where the HRS § 587-73 criteria for the award of
permanent custody has been satisfied. The only
difference is that HRS § 587-73(a) authorizes the
award of permanent custody when the child's family is
either unwilling or unable to provide the child with a
safe family home, whereas HRS § 571-61(b)(1)(E)
authorizes the termination of parental rights when the
parent is unable to provide the care necessary for the
well-being of the child.
 
Thus, under HRS section 571-61(b)(1)(E) parental rights of only
 
one parent may be terminated without regard to a permanent plan.
 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In 2010, Act 135 repealed HRS chapter 587 and enacted
 
HRS chapter 587A. 2010 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 135, § 1 at 282-311. 
The legislative history of Act 135 indicates that the "new Child
 Protective Act," "rewrites and reorganizes chapter 587, Hawaii
 Revised Statutes, to make the new child protective provisions
 more understandable to people who practice in this area of law on
 a regular basis, those who may be new to this area of law, and
 those who may not have legal representation." S. Stand. Comm.
 Rep. No. 2613, in 2010 Senate Journal, at 1045. Thus, HRS
 chapter 587A was a re-enactment of HRS chapter 587 and,
 therefore, the reasoning of In re Doe should also apply to HRS
 chapter 587A, that HRS chapters 571 and 587A are not mutually
 exclusive, rather they provide the Family Court with the
 authority to address issues whether they arise under HRS chapters
 571 or 587A. 
HRS section 587A-33 is a substantial re-enactment of
 
HRS section 587-73. Thus, the reasoning of In re Male Child
 applies here as well. HRS section 587A-33(a) allows for the
 termination of parental rights when a parent is not willing and
 able to provide a safe family home and it is not reasonably
 foreseeable that a parent will become willing and able to provide
 a safe family home, even with the assistance of a service plan,
 within a reasonable period of time, and a permanent plan is in
 the best interest of the child. However, HRS section 571­61(b)(1)(E) also allows for the termination of only one parent's
 parental rights upon a finding that a parent is unable to provide
 now and in the forseeable future the care necessary for the well­being of the child. 
The Family Court in this case found that Father was not
 
willing and able to provide a safe family home and that it was
 not reasonably foreseeable that Father would become willing and
 able to provide a safe family home for KK, even with the
 assistance of a service plan, within a reasonable period of time. 
Having met the standard necessary for termination under HRS
 chapter 587A, irrespective of whether termination of one of two
 parents' rights is permissible under HRS section 587A-33(b),
 termination of Father's parental right is permissible under HRS
 
12
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
section 571-61(b)(1)(E). See In re Doe, 84 Hawai' i 41, 51-52, 
928 P.2d 883, 893-94. 
B.	 Substantial evidence was presented that Father was
not willing and able to provide a safe family
home.
 
Contrary to Father's claim, and in light of the
 
evidence introduced, including Father's history of physical,
 
drug, and alcohol abuse; lack of participation in domestic
 violence services, anger management classes, and couples
 counseling; multiple drug monitoring no-shows; and evidence of
 anger issues, there was substantial evidence that Father was not
 willing and able to provide a safe family home, even with the
 assistance of a service plan, and that it was not reasonably
 foreseeable that Father would become willing and able to provide
 a safe family home, even with the assistance of a service plan,
 within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed two years from
 KK's date of entry into foster care on April 24, 2014. 
IV.	 CONCLUSION
 
The Order Terminating Parental Rights, filed on May 23,
 
2016, in the Family Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.
