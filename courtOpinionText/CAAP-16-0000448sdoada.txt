APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 16-1-0231)

(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.) 
Plaintiff-Appellant the State of Hawai 'i (the State) 
appeals from the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order 
Granting Motion to Dismiss Felony Information as Matter of Law, entered on May 5, 2016 (Dismissal Order), by the Circuit Court of 
the First Circuit (Circuit Court).

The State raises a single point of error on appeal, 
contending that the Circuit Court abused its discretion in 
entering the Dismissal Order. The issue raised and relevant circumstances of this case are indistinguishable from those in the Hawai
'i Supreme Court's recent decision in State v. King, 139

 The Honorable Rom A. Trader presided.

Hawai'i 249, 386 P.3d 886 (2016). In King, the supreme court 
held that the violation of a trespass warning "issued pursuant to 
HRS ยง 708-814(1)(b) is not a 'defiance of a lawful order' under HRS ยง 708-800," and therefore, the violation of a trespass warning "cannot be made a vehicle for a second-degree burglary charge under HRS ยง 708-811." King, 139 Hawai
'i at 257, 386 P.3d 
at 894 (brackets omitted). 
Accordingly, the Circuit Court's May 5, 2016 Dismissal
 
Order is affirmed.
