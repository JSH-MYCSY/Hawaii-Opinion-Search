APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 10-1-0339)

 
DENYING FEBRUARY 24, 2017 HRAP RULE 40 MOTION
FOR RECONSIDERATION OF FEBRUARY 14, 2017 ORDER
DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) the February 14, 2017 order
 
dismissing appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction,
 
(2) Plaintiff-Appellant Kurt P. MacCarley's (Appellant MacCarley) February 24, 2017 motion for reconsideration of the February 14, 2017 dismissal order pursuant to Rule 40 of the Hawai
'i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP), and (3) the record, we did not overlook or misapprehend any points of law or fact when we entered the February 14, 2017 dismissal order. 
We note that, although Appellant MacCarley appears to

 
have subsequently filed a February 23, 2017 notice of voluntary
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
dismissal of all his claims as to Defendant-Appellee Joseph 
Michael Magaldi, III (Appellee Magaldi) pursuant to Rule 41(a)(1)(A) of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP), 
Appellant MacCarley's February 23, 2017 notice of voluntary dismissal does not apply retroactively to cure the jurisdictional failure of the July 13, 2015 judgment to resolve Appellant MacCarley's claims against Appellee Magaldi. Furthermore, Appellant MacCarley's February 23, 2017 HRCP Rule 41(a)(1)(A) notice of voluntary dismissal does not cure the failure of the July 13, 2015 judgment to specifically identify the claim or claims on which the circuit court intends to enter judgment, given that this case involves multiple claims such as Appellant MacCarley's three-count second amended complaint. As the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has explained, 
if a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a case
involving multiple claims or multiple parties, the judgment
(a) must specifically identify the party or parties for and
against whom the judgment is entered, and (b) must (i)
identify the claims for which it is entered, and
(ii) dismiss any claims not specifically identified[.]
 
Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai 'i 115, 119, 
869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994) (emphases added). 
For example: 'Pursuant to the jury verdict entered on
(date), judgment in the amount of $___ is hereby entered in
favor of Plaintiff X and against Defendant Y upon counts I
through IV of the complaint." . . . . If the circuit
 court intends that claims other than those listed in the
 judgment language should be dismissed, it must say so: for
example, "Defendant Y's counterclaim is dismissed," or
"Judgment upon Defendant Y's counterclaim is entered in
favor of Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all other
claims, counterclaims, and cross-claims are dismissed."
 
Id. at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4.
 
The main purpose for requiring a single judgment that,
 
on its face, resolves all claims against all parties is to
 
relieve appellate courts of an otherwise necessary search of the
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
voluminous record on appeal for all possible dispositive orders 
to confirm finality under HRCP Rule 58. 
If we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality, . . . and we should not make such searches
necessary by allowing the parties the option of waiving the
requirements of HRCP [Rule] 58.
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (original emphasis). 
"[A]n appeal from any judgment will be dismissed as premature if 
the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. (original emphasis). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED AND DECREED that
 
Appellant MacCarley's February 24, 2017 HRAP Rule 40 motion for
 reconsideration of the February 14, 2017 dismissal order is
 denied.
