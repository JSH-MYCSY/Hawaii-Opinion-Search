Upon review of the record on appeal, it appears that we
 
lack appellate jurisdiction over Plaintiff-Appellant OneWest
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Bank, F.S.B.'s (Appellant OneWest Bank) appeal in appellate court
 
case number CAAP-16-0000455 from the following five documents:
 
(1) the Honorable Elizabeth A. Strance's March 6, 2015

order granting Appellant OneWest Bank's second
motion for an order confirming the foreclosure
sale; 
(2) the Honorable Elizabeth A. Strance's March 27,
2015 final judgment;
 
(3) the Honorable Melvin H. Fujino's September 22,
2015 post-judgment "Order Denying Plaintiff
OneWest Bank's Motion for an Order (1) Vacating
Order Confirming Foreclosure Sale Filed March 6,
2015; (2) Determining Deductions to Plaintiff's
Credit Bid Deposit; (3) Reopening Bid at Hearing
on Motion; (4) Confirming Sale to Plaintiff at
Adjusted Credit Bid Amount; (5) for Other HRCP
Rule 60(b) Relief; Alternatively (6) Instructing
Commissioner to Conduct a New Auction, Filed
May 21, 2015" (the September 22, 2015 post-
judgment order);
 
(4) the Honorable Melvin H. Fujino's February 12, 2016
post-judgment order denying Appellant OneWest
Bank's October 2, 2015 post-judgment motion for
HRCP Rule 59 reconsideration of the September 22,
2015 post-judgment order and a July 24, 2015 post-
judgment order (the February 12, 2016 post-
judgment order); and
 
(5) the Honorable Melvin H. Fujino's May 12, 2016
judgment on the September 22, 2015 post-judgment
order and the February 12, 2016 post-judgment
order.
 
As this court already stated in a July 13, 2016 order in a
 
separate appeal in appellate court case number CAAP-16-0000123,
 under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp.
 2015), Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP), 
and the holding in Ditto v. McCurdy,  103 Hawai 'i 153, 160, 80 
P.3d 974, 981 (2003), we have appellate jurisdiction in appellate
 court case number CAAP-16-0000123 to review the September 22,
 2015 post-judgment order and the February 12, 2016 post-judgment
 order, but, under Rule 4(a) of the Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Procedure (HRAP), Appellant OneWest Bank's March 1, 2016 notice
 
of appeal was not timely as to any of the earlier orders or
 judgments, such as
 
(1) the Honorable Elizabeth A. Strance's June 3, 2014
judgment on a decree of foreclosure, which was
immediately appealable pursuant to HRS § 667­51(a)(1) (Supp. 2015), and 
(2) the Honorable Elizabeth A. Strance's March 27,2015 final judgment, which was immediatelyappealable pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a) (1993 &Supp. 2015), HRCP Rule 58, and the holding inJenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
In appellate court case number CAAP-16-0000455,
 
Appellant OneWest Bank's June 9, 2016 notice of appeal is

 
untimely under HRAP Rule 4(a) as to all of the appealable post-
judgment orders and judgments that Appellant OneWest Bank
 designated for appellate review. Once the circuit court enters a
 
1
judgment (as HRCP Rule 54(a)  defines the word "judgment"), any
subsequent "post-judgment order is an appealable final order under HRS § 641-1(a) if the order ends the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be accomplished." Ditto, 103 Hawai
'i at 157, 
80 P.3d at 978 (citation omitted). Furthermore, "the separate judgment requirement articulated in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 
(1994)] is inapposite in the post-judgment context." Ditto, 103 
Hawai'i at 158, 80 P.3d at 979. 
Clearly, the rule in Jenkins – to wit, that circuit court
orders resolving claims against parties must generally be
reduced to a judgment and the judgment must be entered in
favor of or against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP
Rule 58 before an appeal may be taken – is limited to
circuit court orders disposing of claims raised in a circuit
court complaint.

 "'Judgment' as used in these rules includes a decree and any order
from which an appeal lies." HRCP Rule 54(a) (emphasis added).

Id. at 159, 80 P.3d at 980. For example, in Ditto, where parties
 
filed an October 30, 2000 notice of appeal and a December 19,
 2000 notice of cross-appeal from both 

(1) an appealable final March 24, 2000 post-judgment
order granting in part and denying in part a post-
judgment motion to return garnishment funds and

award attorneys' fees and costs, and 
(2) a separate September 28, 2000 judgment that the
circuit court entered on that same March 24, 2000
post-judgment order,
 
the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i dismissed that portion of the appeal 
as untimely under HRAP Rule 4(a), explaining that
 
the time for appealing the matters conclusively decided by
the March 24, 2000 [post-judgment] order commenced upon
entry thereof, not upon entry of the superfluous September
28, 2000 judgment on the [March 24, 2000 post-judgment]
order. Pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) . . . , when a civil
appeal is permitted by law, the notice of appeal shall be
filed within 30 days after the entry of the judgment or
appealable order. Ditto's October 30, 2000 notice of appeal
and McCurdy and PCT's December 19, 2000 cross-appeal . . .
filed more than thirty days after the March 24, 2000
appealable [post-judgment] order, are untimely appeals of
the matters decided by the March 24, 2000 [post-judgment]
order. Lacking jurisdiction to entertain [this] appeal . .
., which can neither be waived by the parties nor
disregarded by the court in the exercise of judicial
discretion, we dismiss the appeal and cross-appeal from the
March 24, 2000 [post-judgment] order and September 28, 2000
judgment[.]
 
Id. at 159-60, 80 P.3d at 980-81 (emphases added; citations,
 
internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted).

 
Similarly in the instant case, there are two post-
judgment orders that are appealable under HRS § 641-1(a) and the
 holding in
 Ditto, and, therefore, do not need a separate judgment
 
for the purpose of perfecting any right to appeal:
 
(1) the September 22, 2015 post-judgment order denying
Appellant OneWest Bank's May 21, 2015 HRCP

Rule 60(b) post-judgment motion to vacate the
March 27, 2015 final judgment; and
 
(2) the February 12, 2016 post-judgment order denying
Appellant OneWest Bank's October 2, 2015 post-
judgment motion for HRCP Rule 59 reconsideration
 
-4­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of the September 22, 2015 HRCP Rule 60(b) post-
judgment order and HRCP Rule 60(b) reconsideration
of the July 24, 2015 post-judgment order awarding
$81,508.84.
 
Under the holding in Ditto, the circuit court's subsequent entry
 
of the May 12, 2016 judgment on the September 22, 2015 post-
judgment order and the February 12, 2016 post-judgment order was
 superfluous, and, thus, the May 12 2016 judgment is not an
 independently appealable document. Similar to the circumstances
 in Ditto, Appellant OneWest Bank's June 9, 2016 notice of appeal
 in appellate court case number CAAP-16-0000455 was untimely under
 HRAP Rule 4(a) as to the two antecedent post-judgment orders,
 i.e., the September 22, 2015 post-judgment order and the February
 12, 2016 post-judgment order. Therefore, OneWest Bank's appeal
 in appellate court case number CAAP-16-0000455 is, in effect,
 untimely under HRAP Rule 4(a) as to all of the documents that
 Appellant OneWest Bank designated in its June 9, 2016 notice of
 appeal except for the superfluous May 12, 2016 judgment. The
 failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a civil matter is a
 jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot waive and the
 appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise of judicial
 discretion. Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127,
 
1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or justice is
 authorized to change the jurisdictional requirements contained in
 Rule 4 of these rules."); HRAP Rule 26(e) ("The reviewing court
 for good cause shown may relieve a party from a default
 occasioned by any failure to comply with these rules, except the
 failure to give timely notice of appeal."). Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number
 
CAAP-16-0000455 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
 
-5­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions
 
in appellate court case number CAAP-16-0000455 are dismissed as
 
moot.
