IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I  
WILLIAM TORRES, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
THOMAS READ, Defendant-Appellee, and DOES 1-10, Defendant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 11-1-1161) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.) 
Plaintiff-Appellant William Torres (Torres), appeals 
from the Circuit Court of the First Circuit's (Circuit Court)1 
"Order Granting Defendant Thomas Read's [(Read)] Motion for 
Summary Judgment" and "Final Judgment in Favor of [Read] and Against [Torres][,]" both filed on May 13, 2016. 
On appeal, Torres contends (1) the Circuit Court erred 
when it limited its ruling to the Tapaoan
2 class action 
settlement agreement (Tapaoan Agreement) and (2) that justice demands that his case be allowed to go to trial. 
After careful review of the points raised and the 
arguments made by the parties, the record on appeal, and relevant legal authorities, we resolve Torres's points on appeal as follows and we vacate and remand. 
1. In his first point, Torres argues that the Circuit 
Court erred in confining its consideration of Torres's negligence claim to the Tapaoan Agreement despite his presentation of "more

precise arguments presented at oral argument and in writing, as 
well as the Complaint." Torres fails to identify these "more precise arguments" or to provide record citations for where they were preserved before the Circuit Court, which hampers our meaningful review. See Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
(HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4) ("Each point shall state: . . . (iii) where in the record the alleged error was objected to or the manner in which the alleged error was brought to the attention of the court or agency.") and HRAP Rule 28(b)(7) ("The argument, containing the contentions of the appellant on the points presented and the reasons therefor, with citations to the authorities, statutes and parts of the record relied on. . . . Points not argued may be deemed waived."). As the only identified source for his precise arguments is the Complaint, we proceed to analyzing the claims contained therein. 
a. Torres waived all but his negligence claim. 
In his Complaint, Torres asserted a number of claims.  
Excluding those dismissed by the United States District Court, they are: 
3 
1. Count 4, alleging State Constitutional violations
under "Art. I § 5 Hawai# i Constitution (due
process), Art. I § 6 (privacy), Art. 1 § 7(searches, seizures and invasions of privacy), andArt. I § 12 (excessive punishment)," due to "therecalculation of [Torres's] sentence giving him 53days extra days [sic] of incarceration withoutaccurate and complete records, due processrelevant to [Torres's] case, or investigation of[Torres's] claim of overdetention[.]" 
2. Count 5, alleging negligence when Defendantsbreached the agreement in Tapaoan
4 to "implement
new procedural safeguards that would ensure the 
3 On September 9, 2011, Torres filed an amended Complaint
(Complaint) with six causes of action, naming Read individually and in hisofficial capacity as the Administrator for the Hawai #i State Department of
Public Safety's (DPS) Offender Management Office (OMO) as defendants. 
Read 
removed the case to federal court for the claims arising under the U.S.Constitution, the federal court granted Read's motion for summary judgment,and the state claims were remanded to the Circuit Court. Upon remand, Readfiled a Motion for Summary Judgment as to all claims on December 28, 2012. 
4 The OMO was created in 2004 as a result of the Tapaoan Agreement
"to assure the timely and accurate release of prisoners" and "to ensure thatall appropriate documentation is obtained to compute all inmate sentencesaccurately and in a timely manner." It is unclear if the OMO still exists.

timely release of Hawaii's prisoners," and when
Defendants did not meet their duty under HRS§ 353-12 to "'establish a record for each inmateof all facts relating to their admission,
sentence, discharge . . . and all other
occurrences of note concerning the committedperson[.]'" (Emphasis in original). 
3. Count 6, labeled "[p]unitive damages" because"Defendants' manner of 'recalculating' [Torres'sMaximum Term Release Date (MTRD)] was wanton,oppressive and/or done in reckless disregard ofconstitutional and statutory rights so as tojustify an award of punitive damages in an amountto be shown at trial." 
With regard to the purported constitutional violations 
in Count 4, on appeal, Torres only discusses due process 
violations, and only discusses these violations in terms of Read's alleged negligent failure to implement procedural safeguards in his enforcement of DPS's January 1, 2005 policy and procedure (2005 P&P). Moreover, on appeal, he does not discuss his claim for punitive damages from Count 6. Thus, challenge to the rejection of his claims in Count 4 and Count 6 are waived. As a result, the only part of the Complaint that remains for review on appeal is the negligence claim based on: Torres's allegation that Read breached a duty under the Tapaoan Agreement to "implement new procedural safeguards that would ensure the timely release of Hawaii's prisoners"; the alleged violation of Torres's due process rights; and the purported violation of HRS § 353-12 included in Count 5 insofar as Torres argues on appeal that the Circuit Court erred in limiting its grant of summary judgment to consideration of his Tapaoan Agreement ground. 
b. Read did not carry his initial burden for summary
judgment on the Tapaoan Agreement. 
Torres argues that Read was negligent. Torres was 
convicted and sentenced to incarceration in three separate 
criminal actions, with judgments entered on March 11, 1991, May 17, 1991, and November 27, 2002, respectively. He claims Read was negligent in calculating his MTRD. 
There are four primary elements to a negligence claim, 
including that there was a duty of care owed by the defendant to 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the plaintiff. Doe Parents No. 1 v. State, Dep't of Educ., 100 
Hawai# i 34, 68, 58 P.3d 545, 579 (2002). Torres was required to 
show that "[a] duty or obligation, recognized by the law, requir[ed] the defendant to conform to a certain standard of conduct, for the protection of others against unreasonable risks[.]" Id. (emphasis added). 
In considering whether to impose a duty of reasonable
care on a defendant, we recognize that duty is not
sacrosanct in itself, but only an expression of the sumtotal of those considerations of policy which lead the lawto say that the particular plaintiff is entitled toprotection. Waugh v. University of Hawaii, 63 Haw. 117,135, 621 P.2d 957, 970 (1980); Kelley v. Kokua Sales &Supply, Ltd., 56 Haw. 204, 207, 532 P.2d 673, 675 (1975).Legal duties are not discoverable facts of nature, butmerely conclusory expressions that, in cases of a particular
type, liability should be imposed for damage done. Id. 
(quoting Tarasoff, 131 Cal. Rptr. 14, 551 P.2d at 342). In 
determining whether or not a duty is owed, we must weigh theconsiderations of policy which favor the appellants'recovery against those which favor limiting the appellees'liability. Waugh, 63 Haw. at 135, 621 P.2d at 970; Kelley,56 Haw. at 207, 532 P.2d at 675. The question of whetherone owes a duty to another must be decided on a case-by-casebasis. Waugh, 63 Haw. at 135, 621 P.2d at 970. However, weare reluctant to impose a new duty upon members of oursociety without any logical, sound, and compelling reasonstaking into consideration the social and human relationshipsof our society. Birmingham v. Fodor's Travel Publications,Inc., 73 Haw. 359, 370–71, 833 P.2d 70, 76 (1992)("hold[ing] that a publisher of a work of generalcirculation, that neither authors nor expressly guaranteesthe contents of its publication, has no duty to warn thereading public of the accuracy of the contents of itspublication"); Johnston v. KFC Nat'l Management Co., 71 Haw.229, 232–33, 788 P.2d 159, 161 (1990) (declining to impose aduty upon non-commercial suppliers of alcohol, i.e., socialhosts, to protect third parties from risk of injuries thatmight be caused by adults who consume the social hosts'alcohol). 
Lee v. Corregedore, 83 Hawai# i 154, 166, 925 P.2d 324, 336 
(1996). 
The Circuit Court granted summary judgment in Read's 
favor because Torres failed to show Read owed him a legal duty 
under the Tapaoan Agreement. Count 5 of his Complaint alleged that Read breached his duty under the Tapaoan Agreement "to implement new procedural safeguards that would ensure the timely release of Hawaii's prisoners." However, the Tapaoan Agreement is not in the record. Appellate review "must be based 'upon the evidence contained in the record, not upon matters outside of the record[.]'" State v. Lewis, 6 Haw. App. 624, 626, 736 P.2d 70,

72 (1987) (citation omitted); see also City & Cty. v. Toyama, 61
Haw. 156, 158 n.1, 598 P.2d 168, 170 n.1 (1979).  
"[A] summary judgment movant may satisfy his or her 
initial burden of production by either (1) producing admissible evidence to show there was no genuine issue of material fact, or (2) showing that the non-moving party cannot carry his or her burden of proof at trial." Ralston v. Yim, 129 Hawai
#i 46, 48, 
292 P.3d 1276, 1278 (2013). Read--as movant--had the burden to present evidence showing that the Tapaoan Agreement did not impose a duty upon him to "implement new procedural safeguards that would ensure the timely release of Hawai# i prisoners," as 
alleged by Torres in his Complaint.  Read failed to carry this 
initial burden. 
5
Furthermore, Torres also claimed that Read breached a 
number of other alleged duties. For example, Torres contended that the DPS's 2005 P&P imposed upon Read a duty to "establish an accurate and TIMELY release date for Torres and avoid any 
unreasonable risk of overdetention in adherence to approving a recalculation triggered by his [2005] P&P." (Emphasis and capitalization in original). 
In Count 5, Torres alleged 
negligence based on HRS § 353-12. 
The Circuit Court did not rule on these alternative 
grounds. Consequently, we are without the benefit of its analysis and consideration "of policy which favor the appellants' recovery against those which favor limiting the appellee's liability." Lee, at 166, 925 P.2d at 336. Moreover, case by 
case consideration counseled by the Lee court is hampered by the lack of clarity in the facts of this case. For example, it is unclear why the recalculation of Torres's MTRD in Cr. No. 01-1-0548 was conducted in 2009, more than four years after the 2005 P&P took effect. Thus, this case must be remanded for further development of the factual circumstances and for the Circuit Court to consider whether the remaining grounds argued by Torres impose a duty after it "weigh[s] the considerations of policy 
5 Although the Circuit Court did not decide whether Torres could
carry his burden at trial, we note that, at the time summary judgment was
granted, the discovery deadline had not yet passed.

which favor the appellant['s] recovery against those which favor 
limiting the appellee['s] liability" in light of the circumstances that existed in this case. Id. 
2. Torres's contention that justice demands that his 
case be allowed to go to trial "over whether Read's forcing Torres to do an extra 54 days in prison was an unreasonable act" has no merit because he was not overdetained. The miscalculated MTRD of March 5, 2011, was unauthorized by statute and unenforceable.
6 Pursuant to HRS § 706-670(5), DPS was not 
required to release Torres until January 22, 2018. 
Although Torres's judgment was subsequently amended on 
April 27, 2011, he had no preexisting liberty interest or right to a release prior to his January 22, 2018 MTRD until the amended judgment was entered by the court. Torres appears to argue that, because other inmates in Torres's situation received amended sentences, he had a right to a similar amended sentence, and any time lapsing between the miscalculated MTRD and the release pursuant to the amended sentence was overdetainment. 
That other inmates had their sentences amended did not 
create in Torres a right to have his sentence likewise amended. In a case involving five of the individuals Torres contends were overdetained, the Ninth Circuit held that prison officials' duty involved review of each inmate's institutional file and calculation of the sentence based on relevant state statutes; they had no duty "to go in search of additional courthouse 
6 Prior to 2008, HRS § 706-668.5(1) (1993) provided: 
Multiple sentence of imprisonment.  (1) If multiple terms of
imprisonment are imposed on a defendant at the same time, or
if a term of imprisonment is imposed on a defendant who isalready subject to an unexpired term of imprisonment, theterms may run concurrently or consecutively. Multiple termsof imprisonment imposed at the same time run concurrentlyunless the court orders or the statute mandates that the terms run consecutively. Multiple terms of imprisonmentimposed at different times run consecutively unless thecourt orders that the terms run concurrently. 
In 2008, HRS § 706–668.5(1) was amended to provide that
"[m]ultiple terms of imprisonment run concurrently unless the court orders or
the statute mandates that the terms run consecutively." 2008 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 193, § 1 at 714. The amendment was explicitly made applicable only toterms of imprisonment imposed on or after June 18, 2008. Id. at §§ 3–4, at
714. Torres's last sentence, upon which this miscalculation was based, was
imposed on November 27, 2002. 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
records that might affect [the inmate's] sentence beyond what was 
initially received from the court for inclusion in DPS's institutional file." Alston v. Read, 663 F.3d 1094, 1099-1100 
(9th Cir. 2011). Because Torres was released on April 28, 2011--the very next day after the amended judgment was entered--he was not overdetained. 
For the foregoing reasons, the May 13, 2016 Final 
Judgment in Favor of Defendant Thomas Read and Against Plaintiff William Torres entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is vacated and this case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this summary disposition order.
