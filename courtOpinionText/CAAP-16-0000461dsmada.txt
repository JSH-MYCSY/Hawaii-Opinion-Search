Upon review of (1) Minor-Appellant's (Minor)  July 26,
2016 motion to dismiss Minor's own appeal in appellate court case

 
number CAAP-16-0000461 for lack of appellate jurisdiction, and

(2) the record,  it appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction
over Minor's appeal from the Honorable Bode A. Uale's May 12,

 For purposes of preserving confidentiality in this appeal arising
out of a family court juvenile delinquency proceeding, we refer to Minor-
Appellant as "Minor" instead of referring to his or her actual name.

Process and Granting of the State's Motion to Amend Petition for 
Waiver of Jurisdiction and Granting the State's Amended Petition for Waiver of Jurisdiction and Granting Respondent's Motion to Stay Execution of the Order Waiving Jurisdiction Pending Appeal" (hereinafter the May 12, 2016 order denying reconsideration) in FC-J. No. 0102139, because the May 12, 2016 order denying reconsideration does not qualify as an appealable family court order under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 571-54 (2006). The basis for that conclusion is set out in the Order Dismissing Appeal for Lack of Appellate Jurisdiction (CAAP-16-0000513) which we have filed today. 
Furthermore, HRS § 571-22.5 (2006) appears to expressly
 
prohibit the instant appeal, providing that "[a]n order waiving
 jurisdiction shall not be appealable as a final order, but may
 only be appealable in conjunction with an appeal of all other
 issues after a trial on the charge against such minor or adult."
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Minor's July 26,
 
2016 motion to dismiss this Minor's own appeal is granted, and
 appellate court case number CAAP-16-0000461 is dismissed for lack
 of appellate jurisdiction.
