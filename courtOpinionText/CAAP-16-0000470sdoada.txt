Gabriel R.J. Aledo (Aledo) was charged via an Indictment with 
Attempted Sexual Assault in the Second Degree, in violation of

Counts I and II of the Indictment stem from an alleged 
sexual assault of the Complaining Witness (CW) by Aledo. The 
Indictment states: 
Count 1: On or about August 11, 2014, to and including
August 12, 2014, in the City and County of Honolulu, State
of Hawai #i, GABRIEL R.J. ALEDO, did intentionally engage in
conduct which, under the circumstances as he believed themto be, constituted a substantial step in a course of conductintended to culminate in his commission of the crime of Sexual Assault in the Second Degree against [the CW], byattempting to insert his penis into her anal opening,thereby committing the offense of Attempted Sexual Assaultin the Second Degree, in violation of Sections 705-500 and707-731(1)(a) of the 
Hawai #i Revised Statutes. A person
commits the offense of Sexual Assault in the Second Degree,in violation of Section 707-731(1)(a) of the Hawai #i Revised 
Statutes if he knowingly subjects another person to an actof sexual penetration by compulsion
. 
Count 2: On or about August 11, 2014, to and including
August 12, 2014, in the City and County of Honolulu, Stateof Hawaii, GABRIEL R.J. ALEDO, who was not married to [theCW], and knew that he was not married to [the CW], did 
constitute the crime if the attendant circumstances were as the person believes themto be; or
(b) Intentionally engages in conduct which, underthe circumstances as the person believes them tobe, constitutes a substantial step in a courseof conduct intended to culminate in the person'scommission of the crime. 
HRS § 707-731(1)(a) provides: 
§707-731 
Sexual assault in the second degree.  (1) A
person commits the offense of sexual assault in the seconddegree if:
(a) The person knowingly subjects another person toan act of sexual penetration by compulsion[.] 
(Emphasis added). 
3 At the time of the offense, HRS § 707-733(1)(a) provided: 
§707-733 Sexual assault in the fourth degree.  (1) A

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
knowingly subject [the CW] to sexual contact by compulsion
by placing his hand on her buttock, thereby committing theoffense of Sexual Assault in the Fourth Degree in violationof Section 707-733(1)(a) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes.Pursuant to Section 707-700 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes,"married" includes persons legally married, and a male andfemale living together as husband and wife regardless oftheir legal status, but does not include spouses living
apart. 
(Emphasis added). 
On April 20, 2016, before trial or any other relevant 
filings by the State, Aledo filed a "Motion to Dismiss 
Indictment" (Motion to Dismiss) arguing that the "charge in this 
case is fatally defective for failing to define the term 
'compulsion,' in violation of Aledo's constitutional due process rights." Aledo's Motion to Dismiss also argued that the commonly understood definition of "compulsion" does not comport with the definition set forth in HRS § 707-700 (2014).
4 
Also on April 20, 2016, Aledo filed a "Motion to 
Suppress Statements" (Motion to Suppress) requesting that the 
court suppress and preclude from use at trial certain statements 
"obtained as a result of an unlawful warrantless arrest[.]" 
On May 9, 2016, the Circuit Court held a hearing on 
Aledo's Motion to Dismiss and Motion to Suppress. At the hearing, the Circuit Court noted the "vagueness of the charge" stemming from the disjunctive definition of "compulsion" in HRS § 707-700 and orally granted the Motion to Dismiss. Consequently, the Circuit Court did not address Aledo's Motion to Suppress. 
4 HRS § 707-700 provides, in relevant part: 
§707-700 Definitions of terms in this chapter. 
. . . . 
"Compulsion" means absence of consent, 
or a threat,
express or implied, that places a person in fear of public
humiliation, property damage, or financial loss. 
(Emphasis added). 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On May 18, 2016, the Circuit Court entered its 
FOFs/COLs/Order, from which the State timely appealed. 
On appeal, the State asserts that the Circuit Court 
erred in granting Aledo's Motion to Dismiss, specifically 
challenging the three COLs entered: 
1. The commonly understood definition of "compulsion"
does not comport with the definition set forth in HRS § 707-
700. 
Therefore, the definition of that term in HRS § 707-
700 is neither "unmistakable" nor "readily comprehensible topersons of common understanding." 
2. Furthermore, the definition set forth in HRS
§ 707-700 allows the State to proceed [sic] different meansof compulsion -- either an "absence of consent" or "athreat, express or implied." This fails to put theDefendant on notice of what he is being charged with. 
3. Due to the failure of the charges in the
Indictment to define "compulsion," or to elect which meansof compulsion the Defendant is being charged with, Mr. Aledohad no notice as to the nature of the charges against him.Hence, the charges in the Indictment are fatally defectivepursuant to 
State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai #i 383, 219 P.3d 1170
(2009). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as well as the relevant legal authorities, we affirm.
(1) Sufficiency of the Charge. The State argues that 
the Circuit Court erred in granting the Motion to Dismiss due to the State's failure to define the term "compulsion" as used in both counts of the Indictment, because the State contends that the statutory definition of "compulsion" comports with the commonly understood meaning of the term. 
"Whether an indictment or complaint sets forth all the 
essential elements of a charged offense is a question of law, which we review under the de novo
, or right/wrong, standard." 
State v. Merino, 81 Hawai# i 198, 212, 915 P.2d 672, 686 (1996) 
(internal brackets, quotation marks, and ellipses omitted) (quoting State v. Wells, 78 Hawai
#i 373, 379, 894 P.2d 70, 76 
(1995)). 
In Wheeler, the Hawai# i Supreme Court held that an oral 
charge for Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Intoxicant was insufficient because it failed to allege that the 
conduct occurred on a "public way, street, road, or highway[,]" which was an attendant circumstance given the definition of "operate" under the applicable statutes. 121 Hawai# i at 391-93, 
219 P.3d at 1178-80. The Supreme Court reiterated the principle that: 
the sufficiency of the charging instrument is measured,
inter alia , by "whether it contains the elements of the
offense intended to be charged, and sufficiently apprises
the defendant of what he [or she] must be prepared tomeet[.]" "A charge defective in this regard amounts to afailure to state an offense, and a conviction based upon itcannot be sustained, for that would constitute a denial ofdue process." 
Id. at 391, 219 P.3d at 1178 (footnote and internal citations 
omitted) (quoting Merino, 81 Hawai# i at 212, 915 P.2d at 686). 
Here, for Count I and II of the Indictment to be 
sufficient, those counts needed to allege the elements of the offenses intended to be charged, and sufficiently apprise Aledo of what he must be prepared to defend against. 
Both HRS §§ 707-731(1)(a) and 707-733(1)(a) require 
"compulsion," which is defined in HRS § 707-700 as meaning the "absence of consent, or a threat, express or implied, that places a person in fear of public humiliation, property damage, or financial loss." (Emphasis added). The parties do not dispute that "compulsion" is an essential element of both statutes. See 
also HRS §§ 702-205 (2014) (providing, inter alia, that the elements of an offense include attendant circumstances which negative a defense); 702-233 (2014) ("In any prosecution, the victim's consent to the conduct alleged, or to the result thereof, is a defense if the consent negatives an element of the offense or precludes the infliction of the harm or evil sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense."); 702-235(4) (2014) (providing that consent does not constitute a defense if it is "induced by force, duress or deception."). 
We disagree with the State's arguments on appeal, based 
primarily on State v. Mita, 124 Hawai# i 385, 245 P.3d 458 (2010), 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that the statutory definition of the term "compulsion" comports 
with the commonly understood meaning of the term. In its Opening Brief, the State cites the Webster's New World Dictionary (3d ed. 1988) definition of the word "compulsion" as "a compelling or being compelled; coercion; constraint" and "that which compels; driving force[.]" Id. at 287. The State further cites the same source for the definition of "compel" as "to force or constrain, as to do something" or "to get or bring about by force." Id. at 284.   
5 
We further examine the definition of the words 
"compulsion" and "compel" as provided by Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (11th ed. 2003). They are:
com•pul•sion[.] . . . 1 a : an act of compelling : the
state of being compelled b : a force that compels 2 : an 
irresistible persistent impulse to perform an act (as
excessive hand washing)[.] 
and 
com•pel[]. . . . 1 : to drive or urge forcefully or
irresistibly <hunger compelled  him to eat> 2 : to cause to 
do or occur by overwhelming pressure <public opinion
compelled  her to sign the bill> 3  archaic  : to drive 
together syn  see FORCE[.] 
Id. at 253, 256. 
None of these dictionary definitions rise to the level 
of specificity of the definition of "compulsion" in HRS § 707-
700, particularly with regards to "a threat, express or implied, that places a person in fear of public humiliation, property damage, or financial loss." We therefore conclude that the statutory definition of the term "compulsion" departs from the commonly understood definitions of the term to such an extent that charging Aledo in the language of the statutes failed to provide him with fair notice of the charges. 
Next, in determining whether Aledo's right to be 
informed of the nature and cause of the charge against him was 
5 The State's Opening Brief continues by quoting the definitions of
"force," "coercion," and "constraint." However, none of these definitions
track or are consistent with the definition of "compulsion" under HRS § 707-700. 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
violated, we must look at the information supplied to him at the 
time he asserted the charge was defective. See State v. 
Hitchcock, 123 Hawai# i 369, 379, 235 P.3d 365, 375 (2010). In 
the instant case, Aledo filed both his Motion to Dismiss and Motion to Suppress on April 20, 2016, after the Indictment was filed but before any other relevant filings by the State. 
Included with the Motion to Suppress is a Declaration 
of Counsel prepared by Jeffrey A. Hawk (Hawk), defendant's 
counsel at the time. In his Declaration, Hawk states that: 
[d]uring the interview on February 11, 2015, the [CW]
detailed the alleged incident from August 12, 2014, fromwhich the two counts are charged. The [CW] accusedDefendant of holding her down while masturbating on her andattempting to place his penis into her anus[.] 
The State argues on appeal that, in light of Hawk's 
Declaration, "[Aledo] was thus aware that the alleged 'compulsion' was based on the absence of consent, and there is no mention that the sexual contact or attempted sexual penetration was due to an express or implied threat." Of note, however, the record does not reflect that the State would limit the charge based on the CW's statement or that further facts could not be developed in the case. Thus, based on our de novo review, we cannot say that Aledo was properly informed of the nature and cause of the charges against him.
(2) Other Arguments. The State also argues that 
the Circuit Court erred in granting Aledo's Motion to Dismiss because it incorrectly determined that the statutory definition of "compulsion" described different means of compulsion. Notwithstanding the State's arguments, we conclude that the Circuit Court correctly interpreted the definition of "compulsion" given the plain meaning of the definition in HRS § 707-700. 
Finally, the State argues that if dismissal of the 
Indictment without prejudice is the appropriate remedy for 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the charging error here, then HRS § 806-47 (2014)6 providing 
for a bill of particulars is consequently rendered 
insignificant, superfluous, and void. The State failed to raise this argument in either its memorandum in opposition to the Motion to Dismiss or at the hearing, and thus it is waived. See Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Wailea Elua v. 
Wailea Resort Co., Ltd., 100 Hawai# i 97, 107, 58 P.3d 608, 
618 (2002) (citations omitted)). 
In any event, we reject the State's contention. 
In State v. Israel, 78 Hawai# i 66, 72, 890 P.2d 303, 309 
(2002), the 
Hawai# i Supreme Court reaffirmed the rule that 
"all of the information supplied to a defendant must be considered in determining whether the defendant's right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation was violated" and that "information provided in a bill of particulars or obtained via discovery should be considered." Thus, HRS § 806-47 is not superfluous or rendered void. In the instant case, no bill of particulars was requested or provided. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Findings 
of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Granting Defendant's 
6 HRS § 806-47 provides: 
§806-47 Bill of particulars . If the court is of the 
opinion that the accused in any criminal case has been
actually misled and prejudiced in the accused's defense uponthe merits of any defect, imperfection, or omission in theindictment, insufficient to warrant the quashing of theindictment, or by any variance, not fatal, between theallegations and the proof, the prosecuting officer shall,when so ordered by the court, acting upon its own motion orupon motion of the prosecution or defendant, file in courtand serve upon the defendant, upon such terms as the courtimposes, a bill of particulars of the matters in regard towhich the court finds that the defendant should be informed. 
In determining whether further information, and if so
what information, is desirable for the defense of theaccused upon the merits of the case, the court shallconsider the whole record of the case and the entire course of the proceedings against the accused.
