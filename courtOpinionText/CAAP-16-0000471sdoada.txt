STATE OF HAWAI #I, 
Plaintiff-Appellee, 
v.
BRANNON SHAWN MARKS,
Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CRIMINAL NO. 16-1-0098)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, and Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
Plaintiff-Appellant State of Hawaii charged Defendant-
Appellee Brannon Shawn Marks via Felony Information and Non-
Felony Complaint with Forgery in the Second Degree in violation
of Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") section 708-852 (2014) (Count
1), Unauthorized Possession of Confidential Personal Information
("UPCPI") in violation of HRS section 708-839.55 (2014) (Count
2), and Identity Theft in the Third Degree in violation of HRS
section 708-839.8 (2014) (Count 3).  Marks moved to dismiss the
UPCPI charge on the grounds that HRS section 708-839.55 was
unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, and the complaint was
defective because it did not define "confidential personal
information" and thus failed to provide Marks with notice of the
nature and cause of the State's accusation.1#
1/The State subsequently requested and was permitted to amend the
complaint to include the definition of "confidential personal information" as
defined in HRS section 708-800 (2014). The amended complaint specifically

The Circuit Court of the First Circuit ("Circuit
Court")2 granted Marks' motion in part and dismissed the UPCPI
charge in Count 2 with prejudice on the basis that it was
unconstitutionally overbroad.  Marks' motion was denied as to his
argument that the statute is unconstitutionally vague and
punitive.
The State appeals from the "Findings of Fact,
Conclusions of Law, and Order Granting in Part and Denying in
Part Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Count 2 for
Unconst[itut]ionally Br[oa]d, Vague and Punitive Statute and for
Violation of Due Process" ("Order Granting Motion to Dismiss"),
filed on June 13, 2016 in the Circuit Court.  Here, the State
argues that the Circuit Court erred (1) in concluding that the
UPCPI statute was unconstitutionally overbroad, and (2) to the
extent that it concludes that no state of mind is required for
the offense of UPCPI.
Based on the Hawai# i Supreme Court's decision in State
v. Pacquing , 139 Hawai #i 302, 389 P.3d 897 (2016), we concur with
the State's first assertion of error.
Marks was charged with possessing another person's bank
account number without that person's authorization.  HRS chapter
708 defines "confidential personal information" as "information
in which an individual has a significant privacy interest,
including but not limited to a driver's license number, a social
security number, an identifying number of a depository account,
[or] a bank account number[.]"  Haw. Rev. Stat. § 708-800.  In
accordance with Pacquing , the UPCPI statute was not facially
overbroad.  See Pacquing , 139 Hawai #i at 310–13, 389 P.3d at
905–08.  As our resolution of this issue is dispositive, we do
not reach the question of whether the Court concluded that no
state of mind was required for the offense of UPCPI.

charges Marks with "intentionally or knowingly possess[ing], without
authorization, any confidential information of [victim,] to wit the bank
account number of [victim] ending in x8626 appearing on two (2) personal bank
checks, including but not limited to mail, physical documents, identification
cards, or information stored in digital form . . . ."
