OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
CHRIS GRINDLING, Petitioner-Appellee,
v.
STATE OF HAWAI #I, Respondent-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
(S.P.P. NO. 12-1-0007(3)) (CR. NO. 07-1-0533(2))
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
Respondent-Appellant State of Hawai #i (State) appeals
from the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit's (circuit court )
"Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting
Supplemental Ground to Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct
Judgment or to Release Petitioner[-Appellee] from Custody"
(FOF/COL/Order), filed on June 14, 2016.1
In the FOF/COL/Order, the circuit court ruled that in
the criminal proceedings in Cr. No. 07-1-0533(2), which resulted
in Petitioner Chris Grindling's (Grindling ) conviction for
Promoting a Dangerous Drug in the Third Degree and Unlawful Use
of Drug Paraphernalia, the trial court had plainly erred under
Rule 52(b) of the Hawai# i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) by
failing to engage Grindling in a colloquy before accepting his
stipulation to facts establishing an element of the offenses

charged ( Stipulation Colloquy ).2  The circuit court held that
this plain error by the trial court affected Grindling's
substantial rights under State v. Murray , 116 Hawai #i 3, 169 P.3d
955 (2007).  The circuit court thus granted Grindling's
"Supplemental Ground to Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct
Judgment or to Release Petitioner from Custody" (Supplemental
Ground), which had been filed on March 9, 2016.  As a result, the
circuit court vacated Grindling's conviction and judgment in Cr.
No. 07-1-0533(2), and ordered a new trial.
The State asserts the circuit court erred by: (1)
concluding that Grindling did not waive his claims alleging
violation of his due process rights, plain error, and ineffective
assistance of trial and appellate counsel; (2) concluding that
Grindling was denied his right to effective assistance of
counsel; and (3) "determin[ing] that Grindling was entitled to
re-litigate previously ruled upon claims under the guise of a
non-colorable actual innocence claim."
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
2  With regard to the Stipulation Colloquy, the circuit court made the
following findings, which have not been challenged on appeal and are thus
binding on this court:
14.  Petitioner's trial in Cr. No. 07-1-0533(2) was
held in 2008;
 
15.  At Petitioner's trial, the State of Hawaii and
Petitioner's trial counsel agreed to stipulate to facts
establishing the integrity of the chain of custody of a pipe
with residue and four packets of purported methamphetamine
recovered by police and the results of chemical testing of
the residue and contents of the packets recovered which
found the presence of methamphetamine in the residue and the
contents of the packets;
16.  Before accepting the stipulation of facts and
presenting said stipulation to the jury, the trial court did
not conduct an on the record colloquy with Petitioner to
establish that Petitioner was aware of his fundamental right
to require the prosecution to prove each element of the
offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt and that by
entering into the proffered stipulation of fact Petitioner
was waiving his said fundamental right; 
17.  The stipulation entered into by the State of Hawaii and
Petitioner's counsel established proof of an element to the
offenses charged, i.e. the presence of methamphetamine[.] 
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
well as the relevant legal authorities, we resolve the State's
points of error as follows and vacate and remand.
First, under the particular circumstances of this case,
the circuit court did not err in ruling that Grindling did not
waive his claims for ineffective assistance of trial and
appellate counsel related to the issue of the Stipulation
Colloquy.  Grindling has had numerous counsel appointed to
represent him and who have withdrawn from representing him, both
in his direct appeal and related to this HRPP Rule 40 proceeding. 
In its Finding of Fact ( FOF) 21, the circuit court found that
"[a]lthough [Grindling] has proceeded pro se at times, he has
consistently requested the assistance of counsel[,]" and this
finding is not challenged on appeal.  The issue of the
Stipulation Colloquy was raised by Grindling's current counsel as
the Supplemental Ground to Grindling's HRPP Rule 40 Petition.
Given the circumstances, we will address the merits of the
Supplemental Ground.
We conclude that the circuit court's application of a
plain error standard of review to Grindling's collateral attack
on his convictions was improper.  In Conclusions of Law (COL ) 3,
the circuit court concluded that the trial court's omission "was
plain error, pursuant to Rule 52(b), [HRPP], which affected
[Grindling's] substantial rights as set forth in [ Murray][.]"
However, we hold that the circuit court erred in applying a plain
error standard of review, rather than the standard for
ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel.  See e.g. ,
United States v. Frady, 456 U.S. 152, 164-66 (1982) (holding that
a lower court erred in applying a plain error standard in
addressing a convicted defendant's petition for collateral relief
and stating "[w]e reaffirm the well-settled principle that to
obtain collateral relief a prisoner must clear a significantly
higher hurdle than would exist on direct appeal.").
For claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel,
the following standard applies:
General claims of ineffectiveness are insufficient to
establish that the assistance a defendant received was
constitutionally ineffective.  [Dan v. State, 76 Hawai #i
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
423, 427, 879 P.2d 528, 532 (1994)] (quoting Briones v.
State, 74 Haw. 442, 462â€“63, 848 P.2d 966, 976 (1993)). 
Rather, a defendant must show: (1) specific errors or
omissions of defense counsel reflecting counsel's lack of
skill, judgment, or diligence; and that (2) those errors or
omissions resulted in the withdrawal or substantial
impairment of a potentially meritorious defense. [ State v.
Antone, 62 Haw. 346, 348-49, 615 P.2d 101, 104 (1980)]
(internal citations omitted).
Maddox v. State, 141 Hawai #i 196, 202, 407 P.3d 152, 158 (2017)
(internal brackets and quotation marks omitted).
For claims of ineffective assistance of appellate
counsel, a petitioner must establish "that (1) his appellate
counsel omitted an appealable issue, and (2) in light of the
entire record, the status of the law, and the space and time
limitations inherent in the appellate process, a reasonably
competent attorney would not have omitted that issue."  Garringer
v. State, 80 Hawai# i 327, 336, 909 P.2d 1142, 1151 (1996)
(quoting Domingo v. State , 76 Hawai #i 237, 242, 873 P.2d 775, 780
(1994)).  An "appealable issue" is "an error or omission by
counsel, judge, or jury resulting in the withdrawal or
substantial impairment of a potentially meritorious defense." 
Dan v. State, 76 Hawai# i 423, 432-33, 879 P.2d 528, 537-38 (1994)
(quoting Briones, 74 Haw. at 465-66, 848 P.2d at 977).
In his criminal trial, at the time when he contends the
trial court failed to provide the Stipulation Colloquy, Grindling
was represented by Steven Songstad ( Songstad).  Later, in
Grindling's direct appeal from his conviction, he was initially
represented by Cynthia Kagiwada (Kagiwada ).  Kagiwada filed an
Opening Brief on Grindling's behalf.  Grindling then filed a pro
se Supplemental Opening Brief in his direct appeal, which this
court allowed to be filed by way of an order issued on August 14,
2009.
HRPP Rule 40(f) provides, "[w]here the petition alleges
the ineffective assistance of counsel as a ground upon which the
requested relief should be granted, the petitioner shall serve
written notice of the hearing upon the counsel whose assistance
is alleged to have been ineffective and said counsel shall have
an opportunity to be heard."  Based on the record in this case,
it does not appear that Songstad or Kagiwada had an opportunity
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
to address Grindling's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel
related to the Stipulation Colloquy at the hearing on the
Supplemental Ground.3  On remand, the circuit court must allow
Songstad and Kagiwada an opportunity to address Grindling's claim
of ineffective assistance of counsel regarding the Stipulation
Colloquy, and the circuit court must also apply the applicable
standard for ineffective assistance of trial and appellate
counsel, instead of the plain error standard.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Findings of
Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting Supplemental Ground
to Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to
Release Petitioner from Custody," entered on June 14, 2016, by
the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit, is vacated.  This case
is remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings
consistent with this decision.

3  The record indicates that Kagiwada was served with the March 9, 2016
Supplemental Ground, but Songstad was not served.  Further, the transcript for
the May 11, 2016 hearing on the Supplemental Ground reflects that there was
argument presented by the State and Grindling's current counsel, but no
argument or evidence provided on behalf of Kagiwada or Songstad.
