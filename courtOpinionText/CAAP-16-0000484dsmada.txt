IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
KIRK LANKFORD, Plaintiff-Appellant
v.
 
CITY AND COUNTY OF HONOLULU; DEPARTMENT OF THE PROSECUTING
ATTORNEY, for the City and County of Honolulu, et al.,
Defendants-Appellees
and
 
LISA DE MELLO, Deputy Prosecuting Attorney for the City and
County of Honolulu, et al., Defendants
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 15-1-0330-02)

 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
appellate jurisdiction over Plaintiff-Appellant Kirk Lankford's
 
(Appellant Lankford) appeal from the Honorable Virginia L.
 Crandall's June 2, 2016 "Order Granting Defendants City and
 County of Honolulu, Department of the Prosecuting Attorney, and
 Peter Carlisle's Amended Motion to Dismiss Complaint"
 (hereinafter "the June 3, 2016 dismissal order") because the 
June 3, 2016 dismissal order is not eligible for appellate review
 in the absence of a separate judgment pursuant to Hawaii Revised
 Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2015), Rule 58 of the
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) and the holding in 
Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai 'i 115, 119, 
869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals to the Hawai 'i 
Intermediate Court of Appeals from final judgments, orders, or 
decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). HRCP Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." Based on HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i holds that "[a]n appeal may be taken from circuit court 
orders resolving claims against parties only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. 
"Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. 
One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai
'i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008); 
Bailey v. DuVauchelle, 135 Hawai 'i 482, 489, 353 P.3d 1024, 1031 
(2015). "An appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Jenkins, 76 
Hawai
'i at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote omitted). 
On August 19, 2016, the circuit court clerk filed the
 
record on appeal for appellate court case number CAAP-16-0000484,
 which does not contain an appealable final judgment. Absent an
 appealable final judgment, we lack appellate jurisdiction. 
Therefore, 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number
 
CAAP-16-0000484 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
