OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee v.
JOHN BLANE KENUI STANCIL, Defendant-Appellant and
MICHAEL JOHN MISKE, JR., Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 13-1-0735)

 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record on appeal, it appears this 
court lacks appellate jurisdiction because there is no "judgment" 
in the record on appeal as defined in Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-11 (2010). Defendant-Appellant John Blane Kenui Stancil (Appellant) appeals from Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and Order Granting Defendant's Motion to Dismiss for Violation of Hawai
'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 48 or 
Defendant's Right to a Speedy Trial, filed on May 26, 2016 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit in Cr. No. 13-1-0735. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Appellant purports to appeal pursuant to HRS § 641-11,
 
which provides in pertinent part, "[a]ny party aggrieved by the
 
judgment of a circuit court in a criminal matter may appeal to
 the intermediate appellate court, subject to chapter 602, in the
 manner and within the time provided by the rules of court. The
 
sentence of the court in a criminal case shall be the judgment." 
HRS § 641-11 (emphasis added). 
This case was dismissed without prejudice for violation
 
of HRPP Rule 48 and therefore no sentence has been imposed.
 
Therefore, Appellant may not appeal pursuant to HRS 
§ 641-11. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is dismissed for
 
lack of appellate jurisdiction.
