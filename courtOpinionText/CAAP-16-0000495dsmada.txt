IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
MILTON STANT, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P.
 NO. 16-1-0010; CR. NOS 55472 AND 58399)
 
ORDER DISMISSING THE APPEAL PURSUANT TO HRAP RULE 30
 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Upon review of the record, it appears that:
 
(1)
 On June 29, 2016, Defendant-Appellant Milton Stant
 
(Appellant), pro se, filed a notice of appeal;
 
(2) On August 28, 2016, the circuit court clerk filed
 
the record on appeal;
 
(3) On November 4, 2016, after Appellant defaulted on
 
the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief, the court
 granted Appellant relief from default and a first extension of
 time for both documents. The court subsequently granted three
 additional extensions of time for the opening brief, totaling 168
 days, to March 24, 2017. In a January 25, 2017 order granting
 the third extension of time for the opening brief, the court
 cautioned Appellant that no further extensions would be granted

absent extraordinary circumstances. In a March 3, 2017 order 
granting the fourth extension, the court cautioned Appellant that no further extensions would be granted and any further default of the opening brief may result in sanctions, including the appeal being dismissed. Twice the court denied Appellant’s motion for appointment of counsel, and related motions for reconsideration; 
(4) Appellant did not file the opening brief;
 (5) On April 11, 2017, the appellate clerk filed a 
second default notice, informing Appellant that the time for filing the opening brief had expired and, pursuant to Hawai
'i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 30, the matter would be called to the court’s attention on April 21, 2017, for appropriate action, which could include dismissal of the appeal, and Appellant could seek relief from default by motion; and 
(6) On April 21, 2017, Appellant filed a letter
 
indicating he has “[no] more motions to make,” and he cannot
 pursue this appeal without court-appointed counsel.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is
 
dismissed for failure to file the opening brief, pursuant to HRAP
 Rule 30. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai
'i, May 9, 2017.
