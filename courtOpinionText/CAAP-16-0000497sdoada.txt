STATE OF HAWAII, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
STANLEY CANOSA, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CR. NO. 09-1-1524)#
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Fujise, Acting Chief Judge, Reifurth and Chan, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Stanley Canosa (Canosa) appeals
from the June 27, 2016 Judgment of Conviction and Sentence
entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit
Court).1  After a jury trial, the Circuit Court convicted Canosa
in Count 1 of Burglary in the First Degree, in violation of
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 708-810 (2014),2 and in Count 3
of Unauthorized Entry in a Dwelling, in violation of HRS § 708-
1The Honorable Karen S.S. Ahn presided.
2HRS § 708-810 provides, in relevant part:
(1) A person commits the offense of burglary in the first
degree if the person intentionally enters or remains
unlawfully in a building, with intent to commit therein a
crime against a person or against property rights, and:
. . . .
(c) The person recklessly disregards a risk that the
building is the dwelling of another, and the building
is such a dwelling.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
812.6 (Supp. 2010).3  Canosa was sentenced to consecutive
extended terms of imprisonment of twenty (20) years in Count 1
and ten (10) years in Count 3.
On appeal, Canosa argues that the Circuit Court erred
in:  (1) denying his motion for a mistrial; (2) denying his
motion for judgment of acquittal; (3) sentencing him to
consecutive and extended terms of imprisonment that were
"harsher" than the sentence he received in his previous trial;4
and (4) and admitting unduly prejudicial testimony during his
post-trial sentencing hearing in violation of Hawaii Rules of
Evidence (HRE) Rule 403.
After a careful review and consideration of the
parties' arguments, the record on appeal, and legal authorities,
we resolve Canosa's points on appeal as follows and affirm his
conviction, but remand for resentencing.
1. The Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion by
denying Canosa's motion for a mistrial.  At trial, the
Complaining Witness (CW) stated in response to an unrelated
question her belief Canosa stole from her in the past.  Both the
State and Canosa objected and the court immediately struck the
remark.  The Hawai# i Supreme Court has held that "[w]hen an
unresponsive or improper answer is given to a proper question,
the remedy is a motion to strike."  State v. Hashimoto, 46 Haw.
183, 195, 377 P.2d 728, 736 (1962).  Furthermore, when a
prosecution's witness makes an improper remark, "any harm or
prejudice resulting to the defendant can be cured by the court's
instructions to the jury.  In such cases it will be presumed that
the jury adhered to the court's instructions."  State v. Samuel,
74 Haw. 141, 149 n.2, 838 P.2d 1374, 1378 n.2 (1992) (citation
3HRS § 708-812.6 then provided, in relevant part:
Unauthorized entry in a dwelling.   
(1)  A person commits the offense of unauthorized entry in a
dwelling if the person intentionally or knowingly enters
unlawfully into a dwelling with reckless disregard of the
risk that another person was lawfully present in the
dwelling, and another person was lawfully present in the
dwelling.
4For clarity, two of Canosa's points of error were consolidated into
one.
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
and internal quotation marks omitted).  Given the promptness of
the curative instruction we conclude that the Circuit Court did
not abuse its discretion in denying Canosa's motion for mistrial.
2. The Circuit Court did not err in denying Canosa's
motion for judgment of acquittal as, taking the evidence in the
light most favorable to the prosecution,  State v. Timoteo, 87
Hawai#i 108, 112-13, 952 P.2d 865, 869-70 (1997), there was
substantial evidence of his intent to commit a crime. 
The Hawai #i Supreme Court has held that, "[b]ased on
the plain language of the statute and the historical development
of the offense of burglary, . . . in order to sustain a burglary
conviction, the evidence must show that the unlawful entry was
effected for the purpose of committing an offense against a
person or property rights."  State v. Mahoe , 89 Hawai #i 284, 288,
972 P.2d 287, 291 (1998).  "The intent to commit the offense must
have existed at the time the unlawful entry was made."  Id. 
"[T]he crime intended to be committed on the premises does not
have to be committed in order to make the act of entering or
remaining the crime of burglary, only the intent must be formed."
State v. Robins , 66 Haw. 312, 314, 660 P.2d 39, 41 (1983)
overruled on other grounds by State v. Robins , 66 Haw. 312, 660
P.2d 39 (1983).  Canosa challenges his Burglary in the First
Degree conviction because he argues "there was no evidence
showing that [he] had an intent to commit a crime prior to
allegedly entering the subject boat."
We are thus drawn back to the oft-repeated proposition that, 
given the difficulty of proving the requisite state of mind
by direct evidence in criminal cases, "we have consistently
held that . . . proof by circumstantial evidence and
reasonable inferences arising from circumstances surrounding
the [defendant's conduct] is sufficient. . . . Thus, the
mind of an alleged offender may be read from his acts,
conduct and inferences fairly drawn from all the
circumstances."
State v. Stocker, 90 Hawai #i 85, 90, 976 P.2d 399, 406 (1999)
(citation and some brackets omitted).  From Canosa's conduct and
inferences fairly drawn from all the circumstances, there was
substantial evidence that Canosa intended to commit sexual
assault while on the boat even if such an assault was not
committed.  Witnesses testified that Canosa entered the boat
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
without permission.  CW testified that Canosa had previously
encountered CW on-board the boat when Canosa had entered the boat
without permission, that on the morning in question Canosa again
entered the boat without permission, found CW asleep on the boat,
held down the CW while trying to remove her pants and insert his
fingers into her vagina, and only relented and left after CW
tricked him into thinking her boyfriend had returned.
Based on the testimony of the State's witnesses and
viewing all inferences in light most favorable to the State, the
State provided sufficient evidence to show that Canosa intended
to commit a crime against CW when he entered CW's boat.  The
Circuit Court did not err in denying Canosa's motion for judgment
of acquittal.  
3. Canosa argues that the Circuit Court abused its
discretion by sentencing him to extended and consecutive terms of
imprisonment, by imposing a new sentence that is more severe
following retrial in violation of HRS § 706-609 (2014), and that
the sentence was unconstitutionally cruel and unusual.  Canosa
does not challenge the Circuit Court's authority to impose either
extended or consecutive terms nor does he dispute that the jury
found the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Canosa was
a multiple offender and that it was necessary for the protection
of the public to extend his sentences.  See HRS § 706-662 (2014);
see also HRS § 706-664 (2014).  Rather, without identifying any
support presented in the record, Canosa argues only that "a ten
year sentence for the burglary in the first degree and a five
year sentence for unauthorized entry in a dwelling in the second
degree, to run concurrently, would have been more than
sufficient" in light of factors we presume Canosa gleaned from
HRS § 706-606 (2014).5
5HRS § 706-606 requires that the sentencing court consider the
following factors in determining the particular sentence to be imposed:
(1) The nature and circumstances of the offense and the
history and characteristics of the defendant; 
(2) The need for the sentence imposed:
(a) To reflect the seriousness of the offense, to
promote respect for law, and to provide just
(continued...)
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Given that the jury made the required factual findings
under HRS § 706-662, it was within the Circuit Court's discretion
to sentence Canosa to extended terms of imprisonment.  See HRS
§ 706-661 (2014).  Canosa fails to present specific argument with
respect to the imposition of consecutive sentences.  "[A]bsent
clear evidence to the contrary, it is presumed that a sentencing
court will have considered all the factors."  State v. Hussein ,
122 Hawai #i 495, 518, 229 P.3d 313, 336 (2010) (citation,
internal quotation marks, ellipses, emphasis, and some brackets
omitted).  The Circuit Court indicated that it considered the HRS
§ 706-606 factors and, after doing so, concluded that "[Canosa]
has shown himself to be a danger to the community."  Given that
the Circuit Court articulated on the record its reason for
sentencing Canosa to consecutive terms of imprisonment, the
Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion. 
Canosa also argues the Circuit Court abused its
discretion by imposing a new sentence that is more severe
following retrial in violation of HRS § 706-609.  HRS § 706-609
provides, "When a conviction or sentence is set aside on direct
or collateral attack, the court shall not impose a new sentence
for the same offense, or for a different offense based on the
same conduct, which is more severe than the prior sentence." 
"HRS § 706-609 prevents a sentencing court from issuing a more
severe sentence after the initial sentence has been set aside
upon review."  Keawe v. State , 79 Hawai #i 281, 289, 901 P.2d 481,
5(...continued)
punishment for the offense;
(b) To afford adequate deterrence to criminal
conduct;
(c) To protect the public from further crimes of the
defendant; and
(d) To provide the defendant with needed educational
or vocational training, medical care, or other
correctional treatment in the most effective
manner; 
(3) The kinds of sentences available; and  
(4) The need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities
among defendants with similar records who have been
found guilty of similar conduct.
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
489 (1995).  Here, the Circuit Court imposed the same terms of
imprisonment for each offense, but specified they be served
consecutively, rather than the concurrent sentence in the prior
trial.  Thus, the relevant consideration is whether ordering the
service of the same terms of imprisonment consecutively is more
severe than a concurrent sentence.
In Keawe, the Hawai #i Supreme Court determined that
"[a] sentence is '[t]he judgment formally pronounced by the court
or judge upon the defendant after his conviction in a criminal
prosecution, imposing the punishment to be inflicted, usually in
the form of a fine, incarceration, or probation.'"  79 Hawai #i at
289, 901 P.2d at 489 (emphasis omitted) (quoting Black's Law
Dictionary 1362 (6th ed. 1990)).  There, the court held that
resentencing to two consecutive five year terms of imprisonment
from two concurrent extended ten year terms of imprisonment was
not more severe because the maximum term of imprisonment was the
same irrespective of negative parole implications for the latter.
Id. at 290, 901 P.2d at 490.
In State v. Samonte , the Hawaii Supreme Court held
extending the term of years on two counts after retrial violated
HRS § 706-609 when the aggregate sentence was life without
parole. 83 Hawai# i 507, 543, 928 P.2d 1, 37 (1996).  In the first
trial, Samonte was sentenced to two ten-year terms of
imprisonment for two firearms offenses, to run concurrently with
all other sentences.  Id.  at 511, 928 P.2d at 5.  On retrial,
Samonte was sentenced to two extended twenty-year terms of
imprisonment for the same firearms offenses, to run concurrently
with all other sentences.  Id.  at 513, 928 P.2d at 8.  On remand,
the court required that Samonte be resentenced to: (1) not more
that ten years in each firearms offense and (2) the terms must
run concurrently with the remaining counts.  Id. at 543-44, 928
P.2d at 37-38. #
Applying the definition and principles from Keawe and
Samonte, to determine whether a sentence is more severe under HRS
§ 706-609 we must evaluate each individual sentence as well as
the aggregate sentence.  Here, while the individual prison terms
imposed for each count in the second sentence were identical to
6NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
those imposed in the first sentence, due to the imposition of
consecutive terms in Canosa's second sentence, the maximum
possible imprisonment was increased from twenty to thirty years. 
Therefore, Canosa's second sentence was more severe and violated
HRS § 706-609, and we must remand.
Canosa further argues that his sentence constituted
cruel and unusual punishment.  Canosa was sentenced to an
extended term of twenty years for Burglary in the First Degree. 
Article I, section 12 of the Hawai #i Constitution provides,
"Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines
imposed, nor cruel or unusual punishment inflicted."  Generally,
a penalty legal under a constitutionally valid sentencing statute
is not cruel and unusual.  State v. Iaukea, 56 Haw. 343, 359, 537
P.2d 724, 735 (1975).  Further, the courts will not interfere
with legislative judgment as to the adequate penalty to prevent
crime, unless manifestly cruel and unusual.  State v. Solomon ,
107 Hawai# i 117, 131, 111 P.3d 12, 26 (2005).  The supreme court
has held an extended sentence for Burglary in the First Degree
does not amount to cruel and unusual punishment.  See State v.
Melear, 63 Haw. 488, 500, 630 P.2d 619, 628 (1981).  Reviewing
the facts and circumstances of this case, in light of developing
concepts of decency and fairness, we conclude Canosa has failed
to show his sentence was so disproportionate as to shock the
conscience or cause outrage to the moral sense of the community. 
State v. Guidry , 105 Hawai #i 222, 237, 96 P.3d 242, 257 (2004).
4. The Circuit Court did not plainly err in admitting
witness testimony of a prior crime during the post-trial
sentencing hearing.  For the first time on appeal, Canosa argues
the testimony of the complaining witness from a prior conviction
was more prejudicial than probative under HRE Rule 403.6  
Generally, objections to the admission of incompetent evidence
not raised at trial are not subject to plain error review.  State
6HRE Rule 403 provides,
Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative
value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair
prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury
or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or
needless presentation of cumulative evidence.

v. Metcalfe, 129 Hawai# i 206, 225, 297 P.3d 1062, 1081 (2013). 
Notwithstanding there was no error.  The jury in a post-trial
sentencing hearing is tasked with finding facts necessary for
imposing an extended term of imprisonment, such as whether a
longer term than the statutory maximum is necessary for the
protection of the public.  State v. Keohokapu , 127 Hawai #i 91,
111, 276 P.3d 660, 680 (2012); see also HRS § 706-662.  The
witness testified the underlying events that led to a prior
Kidnapping conviction, in violation HRS § 707-720 (2014), which
was relevant as to whether Canosa posed a danger to the public. 
Canosa does not dispute the relevance of the testimony or
provides argument for why the testimony was unduly prejudicial. 
As the Hawai #i Supreme Court has noted, "evidence with a capacity
for unfair prejudice cannot be equated with testimony simply
adverse to the opposing party; for evidence is only material if
it is prejudicial in some relevant respect."  Kaeo v. Davis , 68
Haw. 447, 454, 719 P.2d 387, 392 (1986).  Canosa, therefore,
fails to demonstrate the Circuit Court plainly erred in allowing
the witness testimony.
Therefore, we vacate the Circuit Court of the First
Circuit's June 27, 2016 Judgment of Conviction and Sentence in
CAAP-16-0000497 to the extent it imposes consecutive sentences in
violation of HRS § 706-609 and remand for resentencing consistent
with this summary disposition order.
