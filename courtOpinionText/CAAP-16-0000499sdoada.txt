APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Ginoza, C.J., and Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
This appeal involves an attorneys' fees dispute arising
from a civil lawsuit originally filed in the Circuit Court of the
Second Circuit ("Circuit Court")  in May 2008, in which the1/
1/ The Honorable Rohonda I.L. Loo presided.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
Plaintiffs Spencer James Bevill, Nancy Lynn Bevill, and the
Bevill Family Trust ("Bevills" or "Plaintiffs") were represented
by the law firm formerly known as Motooka, Yamamoto & Revere,
LLLC ("M&Y").  Upon the conclusion of the litigation, Terrance
Revere, among others, left M&Y, and formed his own firm, Revere &
Associates, LLLC, which assumed sole post-trial representation of
the Bevills at their request. 
On April 26, 2012, M&Y filed a notice of claim of lien
under Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") section 507-81 in the
underlying civil lawsuit against any judgment amount in favor of
the Bevills.  On December 16, 2013, M&Y filed amended notices of
claim of lien and a motion for satisfaction of claim of lien.  On
January 10, 2014, the Bevills filed their first motion to compel
arbitration of the fee dispute.  On April 11, 2014, the Circuit
Court entered an order granting in part M&Y's motion for
satisfaction of claim of lien.  By order dated April 17, 2014,
the Circuit Court denied the Bevills' motion to compel
arbitration, holding that the Bevills had failed to timely
challenge M&Y's billing statements.  On August 20, 2014, the
court issued a further order on the motion for satisfaction of
claim of lien concerning supplemental invoices and documentation,
and M&Y's request for later-incurred fees and costs (together
with the April 11, 2014 order, the "Lien Orders"). 
Following several more years of litigation, including
an appeal taken to this court, Bevill v. Schutte, No. CAAP-14-
0000778, 2015 WL 5924666 (Haw. Ct. App. Oct. 12, 2015),  Real
Party In Interest-Appellant, Myles T. Yamamoto  appeals  from the
Circuit Court's order dated June 16, 2016 that (1) granted the
Bevills' second motion to compel arbitration filed on March 29,
2016; (2) denied Yamamoto's February 26, 2016 motion to enforce
the Lien Orders; and (3) denied Yamamoto's April 28, 2016 motion3/2/
2/In Bevill, we held that the thirty-day period in which to
challenge the billing statement was not a condition precedent to arbitrate the
disputed amount of attorneys' fees and costs claimed as due.  Therefore, we
vacated the Circuit Court's order and remanded the case for further
proceedings.  2015 WL 5924666, at *9.

for fees and costs incurred after July 29, 2014 (the "June 16,
2016 Order").
On appeal, Yamamoto contends that the Circuit Court
erred and failed to substantially comply with Bevill (1) in
denying his motions to enforce his statutory HRS section 507-81
attorney's lien and to award him fees and costs incurred after
July 29, 2014; and (2) in granting the Bevills' motion to compel
arbitration "as to matters protected by the Lien Orders." 
Upon careful review of the record and briefs submitted
by the parties and having given due consideration to the
arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as well
as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Yamamoto's
points of error as follows, and affirm the June 16, 2016 Order.
Yamamoto argues that the Lien Orders are final and
enforceable judgments that continue to have legal effect and that
the Bevills' second motion to compel arbitration was an
impermissible attack on the merits of the Lien Orders.   The
Bevills argue that the dispute must now be arbitrated.4/
"The interpretation or construction of a judgment,
decree or order 'presents a question of law for the courts,'"
State v. Guyton , 135 Hawai #i 372, 377, 351 P.3d 1138, 1143 (2015)
(quoting Cain v. Cain, 59 Hawai# i 32, 39 575 P.2d 468, 474
(1978)), and is "reviewable de novo under the right/wrong
standard of review."  Bank of Hawaii v. DeYoung, 92 Hawai# i 347,
351, 992 P.2d 42, 46 (2000) (quoting  Ditto v. McCurdy, 90 Hawai #i
345, 351, 978 P.2d 783, 789 (1999)) (internal quotation marks
omitted).  The Circuit Court's order granting the Bevills' second
motion to compel is reviewed de novo.  Dines v. Pac. Ins. Co., 78
Hawai#i 325, 326, 893 P.2d 176, 177 (1995); see also  Shimote v.
Vincent, 80 Hawai# i 96, 99, 905 P.2d 71, 74 (App. 1995). 
4/As to the denial of his motions, Yamamoto argues that: (A) he is
entitled to enforce the Lien Orders because: (1) Bevill did not vacate,
reverse or set aside the Lien Orders, rendering them final; (2) the Lien
Orders are enforceable as "law of the case"; (3) the Lien Orders were
enforceable under the doctrine of res judicata and (4) the doctrine of
collateral attack; and, (5) Bevill did not effectively moot the Lien Orders;
and (B) he is entitled to additional attorneys' fees, costs and service
charges incurred after July 29, 2014.  As to the order compelling arbitration,
Yamamoto argues that (C) the use of arbitration to impeach the Lien Orders
amounts to an impermissible collateral attack; and, that (D) the arbitration
claim merged into the Lien Orders judgment and was extinguished as a result.

The Circuit Court was statutorily required to send the
case to arbitration if there was a valid arbitration agreement
and the subject of the dispute fell within that agreement.  Haw.
Rev. Stat. § 658A-7(2) (Supp. 2015).  In Bevill, we held that the
existence of the arbitration agreement between Yamamoto and the
Bevills was undisputed by both parties and that the dispute was
within the scope of the arbitration clause in the agreement. 
Bevill, 2015 WL 5924666, at *9.  Thus, there was no basis upon
which the Circuit Court could have denied the Bevills' second
motion.  "When presented with a motion to compel arbitration, the
court is limited to asking two questions: 1) whether an
arbitration agreement exists between the parties; and 2) if so,
whether the subject matter of the dispute is arbitrable under the
agreement."  Douglass v. Pflueger Hawaii Inc., 110 Hawai# i 520,
530, 135 P.3d 129, 139 (2006) (brackets omitted) (quoting Koolau
Radiology, Inc. v. Queen's Medical Center , 73 Haw. 433, 445, 834
P.2d 1294, 1300 (1992)).  "[T]here can be no trial of an action
if it has been brought on a claim referable to arbitration under
an agreement in writing and a party invokes his contractual right
to have the dispute settled by arbitration."  Ass'n of Owners  of
Kukui Plaza v. Swinerton & Walberg Co. , 68 Haw. 98, 107, 705 P.2d
28, 35 (1985) (citing Haw. Rev. Stat. §§ 658-3, -5 (1976)).
Yamamoto's arguments rest on a contention that Bevill
rendered the Lien Orders final and no longer subject to
challenge.  It did not.  While we noted in Bevill that we lacked
jurisdiction to directly address the Lien Orders because the
Bevill's second amended notice of appeal related back to the
effective date of their original notice of appeal and was
therefore untimely under Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure
Rule 4(a)(1), we had and exercised jurisdiction to address the
order denying the first motion to compel arbitration, which was a
condition precedent to the Lien Orders.  It does not matter that
the Lien Orders constituted a judgment on the merits if they were
based on an order that we subsequently vacated.  C.f. Gregg
Kendall & Assocs. v. Kauhi, 53 Hawai# i 88, 488 P.2d 136 (1971)
(reversing an order denying a motion to arbitrate and remanding
the case for further proceedings despite there being a judgment
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
on the merits in the case).  
In granting the second motion to compel arbitration on
remand, the Circuit Court stated that "the entire foundation for
the lien orders no longer exists and the lien orders could never
have existed had arbitration been compelled."  It stated that it
"can not and will not enforce an order on fees" as this court had
held that the dispute over fees "should have been arbitrated in
the first place."  Thus, although not explicitly stated, the
motion to compel arbitration was treated as a Hawai #i Rules of
Civil Procedure Rule 60(b)(5) motion to vacate the Lien Orders as
those orders were based on the April 17, 2014 order denying the
first motion to compel arbitration that we vacated in Bevill. 
See Mendoza v. Mendoza, No. CAAP-15-0000039, 2016 WL 1092217, at
*3 (Haw. Ct. App. Mar. 14, 2016) ("this court may treat [a motion
for reconsideration] as a HRCP Rule 60(b) motion . . . as we
determine the nature of a party's motion based on the motion's
substance").  The Circuit Court protected and preserved the lien
itself which will be satisfied out of the settlement money that
remains in its custody "pending the outcome of the arbitration."  
Therefore, the June 16, 2016 Order entered in the
Circuit Court of the Second Circuit is affirmed.
