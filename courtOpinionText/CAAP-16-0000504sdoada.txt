Mortgage Pass-through Certificates, Series 2006-1 (US Bank)
 
failed to establish with competent evidence that it had standing
 
to bring this action.
 
The Hawai 'i Supreme Court recently reiterated: 
In order to prove entitlement to foreclose, the
foreclosing party must demonstrate that all conditions
precedent to foreclosure under the note and mortgage are
satisfied and that all steps required by statute have been
strictly complied with. 
See 55 Am. Jur. 2d Mortgages § 575
(Nov. 2016 Update). This typically requires the plaintiff to
prove the existence of an agreement, the terms of the
agreement, a default by the mortgagor under the terms of the
agreement, and giving of the cancellation notice. See Bank
of Honolulu, N.A. v. Anderson, 3 Haw. App. 545, 551, 654
P.2d 1370, 1375 (1982) (citing 55 Am. Jur. 2d Mortgages
§ 554 (1971)). A foreclosing plaintiff must also prove its
entitlement to enforce the note and mortgage.
 
Bank of America, N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai 'i 361, 390 P.3d 
1248, No. SCWC-15-0000005, slip op. at 11 (Haw. Feb. 28, 2017)
 
(further citations omitted).
 
In that case, the supreme court held, inter alia:
 
A foreclosing plaintiff's burden to prove entitlement
to enforce the note overlaps with the requirements of
standing in foreclosure actions as standing is concerned
with whether the parties have the right to bring suit. . . .
As standing relates to the invocation of the court's
jurisdiction, it is not surprising that standing must be
present at the commencement of the case. Accordingly, a
foreclosing plaintiff does not have standing to foreclose on
mortgaged property unless, [at the time the action was
commenced,] the plaintiff was entitled to enforce the note
that has been defaulted on.
 
Id., slip op. at 12-14 (citations, internal quotation marks, and
 
brackets omitted; format altered).
 
With respect to the foreclosure appeal before it, the
 
supreme court determined:
 
Although Bank of America produced evidence that it
possessed the blank-indorsed Note at the time it sought
summary judgment, a material question of fact exists as to
whether Bank of America possessed the Note, or was otherwise
a holder, at the time it brought the foreclosure action.
Indeed, the copy of the Note attached to the summary
judgment motion does not reflect the date of the blank
indorsement, and the Egan Declaration, which was made after
the filing of the complaint in this case, does not indicate

when the indorsement occurred. Further, there is no
additional evidence in the record regarding the date of the
indorsements or whether Bank of America possessed the Note
at the time of the filing of the complaint. Thus, there is
a material question of fact as to whether Bank of America
was the holder of the Note at the time the foreclosure
 proceedings were commenced, which in turn raises the issue
of whether Bank of America had standing to foreclose on the
Property at the time it brought the foreclosure action. 
. . . [T]here is no evidence in the record, either
through the Note itself, the Egan Declaration, or the other
documents attached to the motion for summary judgment,
showing that the blank indorsement on the Note occurred
prior to the initiation of the suit. Consequently, there is
a genuine issue as to whether Bank of America was entitled
to foreclose when it commenced the proceeding. Thus,
viewing the facts and inferences in the light most favorable
to Homeowner, there is a genuine issue of material fact as
to whether Bank of America held the Note at the time it
 filed the complaint. Accordingly, Bank of America failed to
meet its burden of demonstrating that it was entitled to
judgment as a matter of law, and the circuit court erred in
granting Bank of America’s motion for summary judgment. In
 light of this ruling, we need not address Homeowner’s
arguments with respect to whether the Mortgage was validly
assigned to Bank of America. 
Id., slip op. at 19-22 (citation and footnotes omitted).
 
Here, although at the time US Bank filed its motion for
 
summary judgment and for interlocutory decree of foreclosure, US
 
Bank produced evidence that it possessed the subject note,
 endorsed in blank, the copy of the subject note attached to the
 motion does not reflect the date of the blank endorsement, and
 the supporting declarations, which were made after the filing of
 the complaint, do not indicate when the endorsement occurred or
 whether US Bank possessed the note at the time of the filing of
 the Complaint. US Bank accurately notes that, in paragraph 9,
 the Complaint alleges that US Bank is the holder of the subject
 note. However, an allegation in an unverified complaint is not
 evidence which may support a summary judgment motion.

Thus, viewing the facts and inferences in the light
 
most favorable to Argus, there is a genuine issue of material
 
fact as to whether US Bank held the subject note at the time it
 filed the complaint. Accordingly, US Bank failed to meet its
 burden of demonstrating that it was entitled to judgment as a
 matter of law, and the Circuit Court erred in granting US Bank's
 motion for summary judgment. In light of this ruling, we need
 not address Argus's other arguments. 
Therefore, the Circuit Court's June 6, 2016 Judgment is
 
vacated and this case is remanded to the Circuit Court for
 further proceedings.
