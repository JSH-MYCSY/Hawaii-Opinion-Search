IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
DEWITT LONG, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CR. NO. 06-1-1478)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Dewitt Long (Long) appeals from the
June 8, 2016 Order of Resentencing Revocation of Probation
(Order) entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
(Circuit Court).1  Through this Order, Long was resentenced for
his conviction of Promoting a Dangerous Drug in the Third Degree
(Promoting Third) in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง
712-1243 (2014)  to, inter alia , five years incarceration to run
concurrently with any other sentence he was serving.
On appeal, Long contends the Circuit Court abused its
discretion in revoking his probation because the revocation
hearing did not occur until after his initial five-year term of
probation had expired.
After a careful review of the record on appeal and the
relevant legal authorities, and giving due consideration to the
issue and the arguments raised by the parties we resolve Long's
appeal as follows and affirm.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2Long's sentence was amended, on March 10, 2010, to waive the
probation service fee due to inability to pay.
3The State alleged in the initial motion that Long had violated his
probation by being found guilty on March 22, 2013, of felony sexual assault
offenses committed by him on May 9, 2011.  The State subsequently filed a
revised motion to revoke probation which alleged that Long had been found
guilty of additional felony sexual assault offenses and kidnapping.
4During the interval between the State's motion and the revocation
hearing, Long was allowed to change his court appointed counsel four times.
2"A trial court abuses its discretion when it 'clearly
exceed[s] the bounds of reason or has disregarded rules or
principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a
party litigant.'"  State v. Garcia , 135 Hawai #i 361, 368, 351
P.3d 588, 595 (2015) (quoting State v. Merino , 81 Hawai #i 198,
211, 915 P.2d 672, 685 (1996)).
HRS ยง 706-627(1) (2014) provides:
(1) Upon the filing of a motion to revoke a probation or a
motion to enlarge the conditions imposed thereby, the period
of probation shall be tolled pending the hearing upon the
motion and the decision of the court. The period of tolling
shall be computed from the filing date of the motion through
and including the filing date of the written decision of the
court concerning the motion for purposes of computation of
the remaining period of probation, if any. In the event the
court fails to file a written decision upon the motion, the
period shall be computed by reference to the date the court
makes a decision upon the motion in open court. During the
period of tolling of the probation, the defendant shall
remain subject to all terms and conditions of the probation
except as otherwise provided by this chapter.
(emphasis added).  "[W]here the statutory language is plain and
unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain and
obvious meaning."  State v. Kelekolio, 94 Hawai# i 354, 356, 14
P.3d 364, 366 (App. 2000) (citation omitted).  Here, Long was
sentenced to a five-year term of probation on July 16, 2008.2 
The State filed the initial motion to revoke probation on June
21, 2013, within the five-year term of probation.3  The
revocation hearing was held on June 8, 2016,4 and the Circuit
Court entered its Order on the same day. 
Based on the clear mandate of HRS ยง 706-627(1), the
Circuit Court was correct in treating the State's initial motion
to revoke Long's probation as tolling the running of theNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
3probationary period.  Therefore, the Circuit Court did not abuse
its discretion in revoking Long's probation sentence.
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the June 8, 2016
Order of Resentencing Revocation of Probation entered by the
Circuit Court of the First Circuit.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, June 30, 2017.
