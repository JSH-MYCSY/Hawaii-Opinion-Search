ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
Upon review of the record for appellate court case
 
number CAAP-16-0000513, it appears that we lack appellate

jurisdiction over Minor-Appellant's (Minor)  appeal from the
Honorable Bode A. Uale's May 12, 2016 "Order Denying Respondent's
 
Motion to Reconsider Denial of Respondent's Motion [to] Dismiss
 Petition for Violation of Due Process and Granting of the State's
 Motion to Amend Petition for Waiver of Jurisdiction and Granting

2016 order denying reconsideration) in FC-J. No. 0102139, because 
the May 12, 2016 order denying reconsideration does not qualify as an appealable family court order under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 571-54 (2006). 
In summary, the Petitioner-Appellee State of Hawai
'i 
(Appellee State) initiated the underlying juvenile delinquency proceeding on March 13, 2015, when Appellee State petitioned the family court under HRS § 571-11(1) (Supp. 2015) to adjudicate Minor as a law violator with respect to four counts of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of HRS § 707-730 (2014) and two counts of sexual assault in the third decree in violation of HRS § 707-732 (2014). Later, Appellee State filed a petition and an amended petition to have the family court waive its jurisdiction pursuant to HRS § 571-22 (2006 & Supp. 2015) and order Minor held for criminal prosecution proceedings in the circuit court, which the family court granted through an order that it filed on February 16, 2016. Minor later moved for reconsideration of this and several other interlocutory orders, which resulted in the May 12, 2016 order denying reconsideration for which Minor seeks appellate review. 
HRS § 571-22.5 (2006) appears to expressly prohibit the
 
instant appeal, providing that "[a]n order waiving jurisdiction
 shall not be appealable as a final order, but may only be
 appealable in conjunction with an appeal of all other issues
 after a trial on the charge against such minor or adult."
 
Furthermore, HRS § 571-54 provides that "[a]n
 
interested party, aggrieved by any order or decree of the court,
 may appeal to the intermediate appellate court for review of
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
questions of law and fact upon the same terms and conditions as 
in other cases in the circuit court[.]" (Emphasis added). Because HRS § 571-54 expressly refers to the terms and conditions of appeals from cases in circuit courts, it is noteworthy that the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i holds that, "[i]n a circuit court 
criminal case, a defendant may appeal from the judgment of the circuit court, see HRS § 641-11 (1993), from a certified interlocutory order, see HRS § 641-17 (1993), or from an interlocutory order denying a motion to dismiss based on double jeopardy." State v. Kealaiki, 95 Hawai
'i 309, 312, 22 P.3d 588, 
591 (2001) (citation omitted). In the instant case, the May 12, 2016 order denying reconsideration does not qualify for appealability under any of these three types of authority for the terms and conditions of appeals from circuit court criminal cases. 
For example, under HRS § 641-11 (Supp. 2015), "[a]ny 
party deeming oneself aggrieved by the judgment of a circuit court in a criminal matter, may appeal to the intermediate appellate court, subject to chapter 602 in the manner and within the time provided by the rules of the court." (Emphasis added). Under the express language of HRS § 641-11, "[t]he sentence of the court in a criminal case shall be the judgment." (Emphasis added). Based on the express requirement of a sentence, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has consistently held that, in the 
absence of a sentence in a circuit court criminal case, there is 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2See, e.g., State v. Ferreira, 54 Haw. 485, 487, 510 P.2d 88, 89
(1973) (Where a judgment of conviction does not include a sentence, then,
under HRS § 641–11, "for purposes of appeal, we are of the opinion that the
judgment entered in this case is not a final judgment conferring appellate
jurisdiction on this court."  (Footnote omitted)); State v. Johnston, 63 Haw.
9, 11, 619 P.2d 1076, 1077 (1980) ("In the instant case, appellant brought
this appeal from the First Circuit Court's order denying his motion to dismis
the indictment. We hold that such an order is interlocutory and is not a fina
order or judgment. It is therefore not one that is appealable under HRS §
641–11."); 
State v. Kealaiki, 95 Hawai‘i 309, 312, 22 P.3d 588, 591 (2001)
("There having been no conviction and sentence in this case, there can be no
appeal under HRS § 641–11 from the ... order granting Defendant's plea
deferral."). s
l
-4-no appealable judgment under HRS § 641-11.2  Consequently, under
the analogous circumstances of an appeal from a family court
juvenile delinquency proceeding, the Supreme Court of Hawai #i has
held that the appealable final order is the judgment of
disposition entered upon the termination of the disposition
hearing:
The final order or decree appealable under HRS § 571-
54 is the order or decree that determines the ultimate
rights and liabilities of the parties.
  In the context of
juvenile delinquency proceedings under HRS § 571-11(1), the
appealable final order or decree is the judgment of
disposition entered upon the termination of the disposition
hearing.
In re Doe, 107 Hawai #i 12, 15, 108 P.3d 966, 969 (2005)
(citations omitted; some emphasis added).
HRS § 571-54 is similar to HRS § 641-11 in that HRS
§ 571-54 requires an underlying final judgment, order or decree
that finally determines the ultimate rights and liabilities of
the parties by providing the family court's final disposition. 
In re Doe,  107 Hawai #i at 15, 108 P.3d at 969.  HRS § 571-54
additionally requires that the aggrieved juvenile offender must
further perfect his or her right to appeal by filing, and
obtaining a family court adjudication of, a mandatory motion for
reconsideration of the disposition.  In re Doe , 102 Hawai #i 246, 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
251-52, 74 P.3d 998, 1003-04 (2003). In the instant case, 
although Minor sought reconsideration, neither the May 12, 2016 order denying reconsideration nor any other order is a final judgment, order or decree that constitutes the final disposition. The May 12, 2016 order denying reconsideration simply denies Minor's March 7, 2016 motion for reconsideration of the family court's prior orders and/or oral rulings: 
(1) denying Minor's February 3, 2016 motion to dismiss
Appellee State's March 13, 2015 petition due to
delays in Appellee State's prosecution of this
matter, 
(2) granting Appellee State's motion to amend its
petition for the family court to waive
jurisdiction pursuant to HRS § 571-22, and
 
(3) granting Appellee State's amended petition for the
family court to waive jurisdiction pursuant to HRS
§ 571-22.

None of these rulings imposed a final disposition, as HRS § 571­
54 requires for an appealable final order in a family court juvenile delinquency proceeding. Based on the family court rulings, this case has not yet concluded, and, the family court did not certify the May 12, 2016 order denying reconsideration for interlocutory appeal pursuant to HRS § 641-17 (1993 & Supp. 2015). Finally, the May 12, 2016 order denying reconsideration is not an order denying a motion to dismiss based on double jeopardy that would be appealable under the collateral order doctrine and the holding in State v. Baranco, 77 Hawai
'i 351, 
355, 884 P.2d 729, 731-32 (1994). Therefore, the May 12, 2016 
3
 The May 12, 2016 order denying reconsideration also granted
Minor's motion to stay execution of the order granting Appellee State's
amended petition for the family court to waive jurisdiction pending Minor's
appeal. 
-5­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
order denying reconsideration does not qualify for appealability
 
under the terms and conditions of circuit court criminal cases,
 and, thus, it is not an appealable final order in this family
 court juvenile delinquency proceeding under HRS § 571-54.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
 
case number CAAP-16-0000513 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
