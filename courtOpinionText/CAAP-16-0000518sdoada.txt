(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
In an appeal arising out of a special proceeding that
 
Judgment-Creditor/Third-Party Defendant/Appellee H. Isabelle
 
McGarry Trust of March 19, 1971 (the McGarry Trust), pro se,
 initiated for the purpose of enforcing a foreign (California)
 judgment in the State of Hawai

Appellant Howard Hofelich (Hofelich), pro se, appeals from the
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
June 17, 2016 "Order Denying Motion Seeking Court's Permission
 
for Howard Hofelich to Intervene as a Party and File a Complaint
 in Intervention" (Order Denying Motion to Intervene) entered by
 the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit.

Although Hofelich purports to appeal from the Order 
Denying Motion to Intervene, the bulk of his arguments are regarding the merits of the case, that was resolved at least five years before he filed the instant notice of appeal. Where, as here, a party is appealing from an order, rather than a judgment on all claims, "this court will only consider other orders which were preliminary rulings upon which the subject Order was predicated or were part of the series of orders which collectively led to that Order." Cook v. Surety Life Ins. Co., 
79 Hawai
'i 403, 409, 903 P.2d 708, 714 (App. 1995) (citations 
omitted); see also Riethbrock v. Lange, 128 Hawai 'i 1, 17, 282 
P.3d 543, 559 (2012). Consequently, under the circumstances of this case, it appears that the only order that is eligible for appellate review is the Order Denying Motion to Intervene, and we address the propriety of that order only. 
As Hofelich acknowledges, a motion to intervene under 
Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 24(a)(2) must 
satisfy all four of the factors adopted in Ing v. Acceptance Ins. Co., 76 Hawai
'i 266, 271, 874 P.2d 1091, 1096 (1994) quoting Kim 
v. H.V. Corp., 5 Haw. App. 298, 688 P.2d 1158 (1984). The
 Circuit Court based its order on a finding that Hofelich failed
 to file a timely motion to intervene:
 
In this case, Final Judgment was entered July 28,
2009; Amended Final Judgment was entered July 2, 2010.
"Motions to intervene filed after judgment has been entered
are viewed with disfavor, and the moving party has a heavy
burden to show facts or circumstances that justified
intervention at that late date." Chierighino v. Bowers, 2
Haw. App. 291, 631, P.2d 183, 1981 Haw. App. LEXIS 220
(1981).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The hearing for the instant action is over 5 years
from the date denying Howard Hofelich's first motion to
intervene and nearly 7 years after the courts entry of HRCP
rule 58 Final Judgment. Therefore the Court finds the
 
instant motion is untimely. [ 2
]
The question of timeliness is left to the sound 
discretion of the trial court. Ing, 76 Hawai 'i at 271, 874 P.2d 
1096. Considering the totality of the circumstances, id., the 
Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion here. Our review of the record reveals Hofelich's first filing in this case was on April 28, 1999.
3 Hofelich maintains in his opening brief that he 
"has been a party and filed motions and pleadings since 1997." Therefore it is undisputed that Hofelich was aware of this action, no later than 1999 when he filed his Motion For Return, at which time he could have sought intervention. Ing, 76 Hawai
'i 
at 271, 874 P.2d 1096 (Intervenor-Appellant could have moved to intervene "as soon as the Ing declaratory action was filed."). 
Moreover, the length of time between when Hofelich 
should have sought intervention and when he did is over sixteen years, during which interval judgment has been entered and appeal therefrom dismissed. In addition, it appears that the boat has been sold and the proceeds applied to the judgment amount owed by Robert and Ann Marie Hofelich, and therefore there would be substantial prejudice to the parties had Hofelich been allowed to intervene. See, Ing, 76 Hawai
'i at 272, 874 P.2d 1097 
(substantial prejudice found when, during eight-month delay, the parties reached a settlement and dismissed the action). 
Therefore, the June 17, 2016 "Order Denying Motion
 
Seeking Court's Permission for Howard Hofelich to Intervene as a

 The Circuit Court's reference to "Howard Hofelich's first motion
 
to intervene" appears to be a reference to Hofelich's January 3, 2011 "Motion
to Reopen S.P. 97-004K as Intervenor; Petitioning the Court for the Return of
His Unlawfully Seized Property Alleging Fraud; Consolidate Case with Civil
Number 09-01-337; and Set Aside of Conclusion of Law and Amended Final
Judgment in SP. 97-004K (HRAP Rule 60, Fraud)." However, Hofelich did not
move to intervene in his January 3, 2011 motion, and the first time he
actually sought intervention was his May 4, 2016 motion for intervention that
the Circuit Court denied in its June 17, 2016 Order Denying Motion to
Intervene

 Somewhat confusingly, the document is captioned, in part, "Robert
Hofelich's Motion for Return of Exempt Items Seized" (Motion for Return)
although it shows the filer's name as "Howard R. Hofelich" and in the body of
the document states, "HOWARD R. HOFELICH, hereinafter "HOFELICH" seeks the
above reference relief[.]"
