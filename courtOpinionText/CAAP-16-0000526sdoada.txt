Judgment  entered in the District Court of the First Circuit,
'Ewa Division, in 1DTA-16-00198.3 
Ringor was convicted of Operating a Vehicle Under the
 
Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii
 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1) (Supp. 2016).
 
On appeal, Ringor contends (1) the record does not
 
demonstrate a waiver of her right to testify because the
 Tachibana colloquy conducted by the District Court was inadequate 
and (2) there was insufficient evidence to convict her.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Ringor's points of error as follows:
 
(1) Ringor contends that the District Court failed to 
conduct an adequate Tachibana colloquy, failed to engage in a true exchange during the colloquy, failed to obtain an on-the­record waiver of her right to testify, and the errors were not harmless. As we agree the District Court failed to obtain an on­the-record waiver of the right to testify when Ringor did not testify, we need not address Ringor's other contentions. Tachibana v. State, 79 Hawai
'i 226, 236, 900 P.3d 1293, 1303 
(1995). 
"Once a violation of the constitutional right to 
testify is established, the conviction must be vacated unless the State can prove that the violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt." State v. Pomroy, 132 Hawai
'i 85, 94, 319 P.3d 
1093, 1102 (2014) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Tachibana, 79 Hawai
'i at 240, 900 P.2d at 1307). Ringor did not 
testify at trial. "It is inherently difficult, if not impossible, to divine what effect a violation of the defendant's constitutional right to testify had on the outcome of any particular case. The record in this case offers no clue to what [the defendant] would have said, under oath, on the witness stand." Id. (quoting State v. Hoang, 94 Hawai
'i 271, 279, 12 
P.3d 371, 379 (2000)). Therefore, the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. 
(2)
 Upon review we conclude there was sufficient
 
evidence to convict Ringor. The Hawai 'i Supreme Court has 
long held that evidence adduced in the trial court must be
considered in the strongest light for the prosecution when
the appellate court passes on the legal sufficiency of such
evidence to support a conviction; the same standard applies
whether the case was before a judge or a jury. The test on
 appeal is not whether guilt is established beyond a
reasonable doubt, but whether there was substantial evidence
to support the conclusion of the trier of fact. Indeed,
even if it could be said in a bench trial that the
 conviction is against the weight of the evidence, as long as
there is substantial evidence to support the requisite
findings for conviction, the trial court will be affirmed.
 
"Substantial evidence" as to every material element of
the offense charged is credible evidence which is of

sufficient quality and probative value to enable a
person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion.
And as trier of fact, the trial judge is free to make
all reasonable and rational inferences under the facts
 in evidence, including circumstantial evidence.
 
State v. Batson, 73 Haw. 236, 248-49, 831 P.2d 924, 931
(1992).
 
State v. Matavale, 115 Hawai 'i 149, 157-58, 166 P.3d 322, 330-31 
(2007) (brackets omitted). 
The State's case consisted primarily of the testimony
 
of the arresting officer, whom the District Court found "very
 
credible." Officer Thomas Billins (Officer Billins) observed
 Ringor operate her vehicle at 11:20 at night on the freeway
 without headlights, using a mobile device, moving from side to
 side within her lane, and at one point slow to 35 miles per hour. 
After Officer Billins turned on his lights and siren, Ringor, who
 was in the right lane, almost came to a stop in the rightmost
 lane, then crossed two lanes of traffic to the leftmost lane
 despite there being a right shoulder available. He used his PA
 system to instruct Ringor to move to the right shoulder which she
 did. However, after reaching the right shoulder, Ringor stopped
 abruptly, causing Officer Billins to reverse and reposition his
 vehicle behind Ringor's on the shoulder.
 
Officer Billins explained to Ringor that she was being
 
stopped for using her cell phone, weaving, and headlights and
 asked for her documents. Ringor responded that she had lost her
 license, giving him her passport as identification, and told him
 that she did not own the vehicle so "was unfamiliar with the
 paperwork and the lighting situation." As Officer Billins spoke
 with Ringor he detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage. 
He also noticed that she had red and watery eyes. Ringor later
 volunteered to Officer Billins that "she only had a few drinks."

Officer Billins also detected the smell of alcohol as he
 transported Ringor to the police station.

 The parties stipulated to Officer Billins's training and
qualification to administer the standardized field sobriety tests. Officer
 
Billins then testified as to the instructions he gave Ringor and his
observations regarding her performance on two of three of these tests.
However, the District Court explicitly stated that "I don't count the field
sobriety test as something that counts against her."

When all reasonable and rational inferences from the
 
evidence are considered, there was substantial evidence of
 
sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of
 reasonable caution to support Ringor's conviction for OVUII.
