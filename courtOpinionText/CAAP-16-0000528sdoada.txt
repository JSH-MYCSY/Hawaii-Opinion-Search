STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P. NO. 16-1-0005(2); CR. NO. 98-0697(2))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant James K. Libero appeals from the
 
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Judgment Denying
 
Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release
 Petitioner from Custody, filed on July 6, 2016 in the Circuit
 Court of the Second Circuit ("Circuit Court").

On October 4, 2000, Libero was convicted of Attempted 
Murder in the Second Degree, Assault in the First Degree, and Attempted Sexual Assault in the First Degree. On direct appeal, this court affirmed Libero's convictions for Attempted Murder in the Second Degree and Assault in the First Degree, but reversed the conviction for Attempted Sexual Assault in the First Degree. State v. Libero, 103 Hawai
'i 490, 507 83 P.3d 753, 770 (App. 
2003), cert. denied, 103 Hawai 'i 479, 83 P.3d 742 (2004). 
Between August 23, 2001 and February 20, 2013, Libero 
filed eight petitions for relief pursuant to Rule 40 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Penal Procedure. The first petition was denied 
because his direct appeal was still pending before this court.

The subsequent seven petitions were also denied.
 
On April 21, 2016, Libero filed a Petition to Vacate,
 
Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner from
 
Custody ("Ninth Petition"). On July 6, 2016, the Circuit Court
 issued Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Judgment Denying
 Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release
 Petitioner from Custody, which denied Libero's Ninth Petition. 
On appeal, Libero argues that if, as the prosecution
 
claimed, he used a kiawe branch to assault the victim, there
 would have been "D.N.A. evidence from the victim and probably
 from Mr. Libero embedded within the branch. The absence of no
 [sic] D.N.A. on the kiawe branch contradicts certin [sic]
 prosecution testimony used to convict Mr. Libero and supports his
 contention that he should have a new trial." Libero also
 requests that "all the missing evidence" in the case be tested
 for D.N.A.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Libero's point of error as follows and affirm.
 
Libero's contention that "[t]his issue is not about 
raised or ruled upon or waived[,] . . . [but] about the truth
 that the state prosecution attorney wants to have the courts to
 be blinded" (emphasis added) notwithstanding, his claim regarding
 the lack of D.N.A. evidence on the kiawe branch was previously
 raised and ruled upon in his second and sixth petitions. In
 addition, Libero raised the issue in his eighth petition, which
 was also denied. State v. Libero, No. CAAP-13-0000415, 2015 WL
 
3384440, at *1 (Haw. App. May 22, 2015).
 
For the first time on appeal, Libero requests
 
additional testing of evidence for D.N.A. Libero failed to
 request that the Circuit Court order additional testing of
 evidence in the Ninth Petition. Therefore, Libero's request is
 denied without prejudice to a post-conviction petition, in
 accordance with Hawaii Revised Statutes Chapter 844D, Part XI.
 
To the extent that Libero's appeal can be construed to
 
assert any other point of error on appeal, Libero failed to prove

the existence of extraordinary circumstances to justify his
 
failure to raise the issue in eight prior petitions for relief. 
Therefore, relief is not available. Haw. R. Penal P. 40(a)(3).
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Findings of
 
Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Judgment Denying Petition to
 Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner
 from Custody, filed on July 6, 2016 in the Circuit Court of the
 Second Circuit is affirmed.
