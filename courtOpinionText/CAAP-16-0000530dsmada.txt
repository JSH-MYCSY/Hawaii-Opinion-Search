Upon review of the record, it appears that:

(2) On September 9, 2016, the circuit court clerk filed
 
the record on appeal;
 
(3) On November 22, 2016, Appellant filed the opening
 
brief;
 
(4) On March 2, 2017, the court granted in part and 
denied in part Plaintiff-Appellee Nationstar Mortgage LLC's 
(Appellee) December 22, 2016 "Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative, Strike [Appellant's] Opening Brief." The court denied the request to dismiss the appeal and granted the request to strike the opening brief because it was filed on Appellant's behalf by an individual who is not an attorney and contains numerous violations of Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
(HRAP) Rule 28. The court ordered that, within forty days from the date of the order, Appellant may file an opening brief pro se, representing herself, or through a licensed Hawai
'i attorney. 
The court cautioned Appellant that failure to timely file the opening brief may result in the appeal being dismissed, pursuant to HRAP Rule 30; 
(5) Appellant did not file the opening brief or request
 
an extension of time;
 
(6) On June 2, 2017, the appellate clerk notified
 
Appellant that the time for filing the statement of jurisdiction
 and opening brief had expired, the matter would be called to the
 court's attention on June 13, 2017, for appropriate action, which
 could include dismissal of the appeal, pursuant to HRAP Rules
 12.1(e) and 30, and Appellant may request relief from default by
 motion;
 
(7) On June 14, 2017, Appellant's daughter, Charlene
 
Cole, executed and filed for Appellant a document that states,
 "At this time we are attempting to work with the lender to
 possibly achieve a loan modification"; and
