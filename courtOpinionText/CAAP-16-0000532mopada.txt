BACKGROUND 
On the evening of August 15, 1978, [Rapozo] was at the
Waimanalo Gym. He purchased a pistol outside the Gym and
tucked it in his pants. He consumed some beer during thecourse of the evening. A girls' volleyball game was inprogress in the Gym and [Rapozo] had been in the Gym playingwith the girls for about an hour when he allegedly becameobnoxious and was asked to leave. As he walked away, he wasconfronted by one Robert Lee, whom he had never met. Lee was fatally wounded by the first bullet fired from[Rapozo]'s gun which struck him in the stomach. After Lee had fallen, [Rapozo] shot him two more times.

State v. Rapozo, 1 Haw. App. 255, 256, 617 P.2d 1235, 1236 (1980) 
(Rapozo I). 
Criminal Case 
On August 23, 1978, Rapozo was indicted for murder 
under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707-701 (1976). The 
statute provided: 
§ 707-701 Murder.  (1) Except as provided in section
707-702 [Manslaughter], a person commits the offense of
murder if [the person] intentionally or knowingly causes thedeath of another person. 
(2) Murder is a class A felony for which the
defendant shall be sentenced to imprisonment as provided insection 706-606. 
On April 10, 1979, a jury found Rapozo guilty as 
charged. At that time, HRS § 706-606 (1976) provided: 
§ 706-606 Sentence for offense of murder.  The court 
shall sentence a person who has been convicted of murder toan indeterminate term of imprisonment. In such cases the court shall impose the maximum length of imprisonment asfollows: 
(a) Life imprisonment without possibility of parolein the murder of: 
(i) A peace officer while in the performance
of [their] duties, or 
(ii) A person known by the defendant to be awitness in a murder prosecution, or 
(iii) A person by a hired killer, in which eventboth the person hired and the personresponsible for hiring the killer shall bepunished under this subsection, or 
(iv) A person while the defendant wasimprisoned. 
As part of such sentence the court shall orderthe director of the department of socialservices and housing and the Hawaii parolingauthority to prepare an application for thegovernor to commute the sentence to life withparole at the end of twenty years ofimprisonment. 
(b) Life imprisonment with possibility of parole ortwenty years as the court determines, in allother cases. The minimum length of imprisonmentshall be determined by the Hawaii parolingauthority in accordance with section 706-669. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On May 16, 1979, the circuit court entered a Judgment 
sentencing Rapozo to life imprisonment with the possibility of 
parole. He was also ordered to pay "restitution in the amount of $11,109.33, the manner of payment to be determined and handled by the Department of Social Services and Housing." 
Hawaii Paroling Authority
Sets Minimum Sentence 
When Rapozo was sentenced HRS § 706-669 (1976) 
provided, in relevant part: 
(1) When a person has been sentenced to an indeterminate
or an extended term of imprisonment, the Hawaii paroling
authority shall, as soon as practicable but no later thansix months after commitment to the custody of the directorof the department of social services and housing hold ahearing, and on the basis of the hearing make an orderfixing the minimum term of imprisonment to be served beforethe prisoner shall become eligible for parole. 
On October 9, 1979, the Hawaii Paroling Authority (HPA) set 
Rapozo's minimum sentence at 30 years, with the qualification 
that "[p]arole shall not be granted until judgement [sic] of restitution is satisfied." 
Direct Appeal 
Rapozo appealed, claiming his trial counsel was 
ineffective. We affirmed the conviction, holding that the record 
as a whole was "insufficient to establish that there was ineffective assistance of counsel[.]" Rapozo I, 1 Haw. App. at 
256, 617 P.2d at 1237. Rapozo also moved for a remand to the circuit court, claiming that "his testimony at trial, on the instructions of his then[-]attorney, was perjured and that actually, despite his detailed testimony as to the happening of the homicide, he was without memory of the shooting due to drunkenness." State v. Rapozo, 1 Haw. App. 660, 661, 617 P.2d 
1237, 1238 (1980) (Rapozo II). We denied the motion. Id. at 
662, 617 P.2d at 1239.

First Rule 40 Petition 
On May 8, 1981, Rapozo filed a "Petition for Post-
Conviction Relief[,]" initiating S.P. No. 5490. He again argued 
ineffective assistance of counsel. The circuit court denied the petition. Rapozo appealed. The Hawai# i Supreme Court summarily 
affirmed the circuit court. Rapozo v. State, No. 8573 (Haw. 
June 26, 1984) (mem.). 
Habeas Corpus Petition 
Rapozo was involved in a riot while incarcerated at the 
Hâlawa Correctional Facility, and was transferred to federal 
custody in 1981. On June 3, 1988, Rapozo filed a "Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus" in federal court, arguing that his trial and appellate counsel were ineffective, and that the trial judge was biased against him because the same judge had convicted his brother of murdering a witness in the case.
2 The petition was 
dismissed. Order Adopting Magistrate's Report and Recom-mendation, Rapozo v. Hawai# i, Civ. No. 88-00414DAE (D. Haw. 
Dec. 16, 1991). 
Second Rule 40 Petition 
On August 13, 1993, Rapozo filed another "Petition for 
Post-Conviction Relief[,]" initiating S.P.P. No. 93-0048. He 
argued that the trial judge was biased against him, the police were negligent in their investigation, and his trial counsel was rewarded for his conviction with a position as a judge. The circuit court denied the petition. Rapozo did not appeal. 
2 Dana Rapozo was the defendant in State v. Rapozo, 2 Haw. App. 587,
637 P.2d 786 (1981). That case involved Dana Rapozo's direct appeal from his
conviction for murdering a witness who implicated his brother, Richard Rapozo,in the murder of Robert Lee. Id. at 589 n.4, 637 P.2d at 788 n.4.

1995 Parole Hearing 
On August 21, 1995, the HPA granted Rapozo's applica-
tion to reduce his minimum term from 30 years to 28 years. His 
minimum term was to expire on August 10, 2006.3 
Third Rule 40 Petition 
On July 11, 1997, Rapozo filed another "Petition for 
Post-Conviction Relief[,]" initiating S.P.P. No. 97-0016. He 
argued that his trial counsel was ineffective, the State mislead the jury by withholding material evidence, and he was denied the right to confront potential witnesses. The circuit court denied the petition. Rapozo appealed. We summarily affirmed the circuit court. Rapozo v. State, 90 Hawai# i 502, 979 P.2d 98 
(Table) (App. 1999). 
Motion to Correct Sentence 
On January 12, 1999, Rapozo filed a "Brief in Support 
of Motion to Correct Sentence." He argued that the statute under 
which he was convicted, HRS § 707-701, has been amended since the time of his sentence. He contended that the crime of which he was convicted did not fall within the scope of the then-current version of HRS § 707-701 (1993), Murder in the First Degree. He argued that his sentence should be corrected to reflect the term of imprisonment imposed by HRS § 706-656, the statute then governing the penalty for Murder in the Second Degree, HRS § 707-701.5. The circuit court denied the petition, noting that HRS § 707-701 was amended, and HRS § 707-701.5 (Murder in the Second Degree) was added, by 1986 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 314, § 50 at 616, and the court "cannot retroactively apply HRS § 707-701.5[.]" The circuit court held: 
3 Rapozo states, in his June 9, 2014 motion for revocation of
restitution, "In 2006, the HPA raised [his] minimum term of sentence back to
30 years without providing any specific reason for the increase[.]" The record does not contain any documentation of an increased minimum term. 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In essence, Rapozo asks this court to correct his
sentence to reflect the sentence of an offense (Murder in
the Second Degree) that did not exist at the time Rapozo wasindicted, convicted and sentenced. Rapozo's requestpresents the issue of whether this court can retroactivelyapply HRS § 707-701.5 (1993), which took effect onJanuary 1, 1987, to correct Rapozo's sentence, which wasimposed on May 16, 1979. 
HRS § 1-3 (1993) states that "[nlo law has any
retrospective operation, unless otherwise expressed orobviously intended." The general rule is that "[sltatutesor regulations which say nothing about retroactiveapplication are not applied retroactively if such aconstruction will impair existing rights, create newobligations or impose additional duties with respect to pasttransactions." Clark v. Cassidy, 64 Haw. 74, 77, n.6, 636P.2d 1344, 1346, n.6 (1981). Because Act 314 took effect on January 1, 1987[,] and because HRS § 707-701.5 (1993) doesnot mention retroactive application, this court cannotcorrect Rapozo's sentence to conform with the provisions ofHRS § 707-656 (1993), the sentence required by HRS§ 707-701.5 (1993). 
On May 16, 1979, Rapozo was sentenced to life
imprisonment with the possibility of parole. This sentence was correct according to the law as it existed at that time. 
Rapozo appealed. The supreme court dismissed the 
appeal after Rapozo failed to file an opening brief. State v.
Rapozo, No. 22327 (Haw. Sept. 9, 1999).  
Fourth Rule 40 Petition 
On January 5, 2006, Rapozo filed a request for 
"Revocation of Restitution Forms" in his criminal case. The 
circuit court construed the filing as a non-conforming petition for post-conviction relief under Rule 40(c)(2) of the Hawai# i 
Rules of Penal Procedure ( 
HRPP) and created S.P.P. No. 06-1-0040. 
The circuit court gave Rapozo 60 days to supplement his non-conforming petition, and sent HRPP forms A and B to Rapozo to complete. Rapozo did not return the forms. Accordingly, the circuit court dismissed the non-conforming petition. Rapozo did not appeal. 
2006 Parole Hearing 
On October 23, 2006, the HPA denied Rapozo's request 
for parole because it was not convinced Rapozo could 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
substantially comply with the terms and conditions of parole. 
HPA recommended that Rapozo participate in work furlough. A rehearing was scheduled for July 2007. 
2007 Parole Hearing 
On July 24, 2007, the HPA denied Rapozo's request for 
parole because it was not convinced Rapozo could substantially 
comply with the terms and conditions of parole. HPA recommended that Rapozo "participate in all RAD recommended programs."
4 A 
rehearing was scheduled for June 2008. 
Fifth Rule 40 Petition 
On January 24, 2008, Rapozo filed another "Petition for 
Post-Conviction Relief" (2008 Rule 40 Petition), initiating 
S.P.P. No. 08-1-0003. He argued that his First Amendment rights 
were violated by application of ex post facto laws, the HPA and Department of Public Safety (DPS) refused to release him after 
the expiration of what should have been his maximum term 
sentence, he was falsely imprisoned, and ex post facto law changes were applied without notification of change or application. The circuit court denied the petition. Rapozo appealed. We affirmed, holding: 
In 1979, Rapozo was properly sentenced in accordance
with HRS § 706-606(b) (1976) to life with possibility of
parole. Rapozo is not being held beyond the expiration ofhis maximum sentence. Rapozo's arguments to the contraryare wholly without merit. 
Rapozo v. State, No. 29771, 2010 WL 2565125, at *1 (Haw. App. 
June 28, 2010) (SDO). 
2008 Parole Hearing 
On June 26, 2008, the HPA denied Rapozo's request for 
parole because it was not convinced Rapozo could substantially 
comply with the terms and conditions of parole. HPA recommended 
4 The record does not reflect what the acronym RAD means. 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that Rapozo "participate in all RAD recommended programs." A 
rehearing was scheduled for May 2009. 
2009 Parole Hearing 
On May 20, 2009, the HPA denied Rapozo's request for 
parole because it was not convinced Rapozo could substantially 
comply with the terms and conditions of parole. HPA recommended that Rapozo "participate in work furlough." A rehearing was scheduled for April 2010. 
Sixth Rule 40 Petition 
On May 26, 2009, Rapozo filed a "Petition for Writ of 
Habeas Corpus[.]" The circuit court construed the filing as a 
non-conforming petition for post-conviction relief under HRPP Rule 40(c)(2) and created S.P.P. No. 09-1-0022. The circuit court gave Rapozo 60 days to supplement his non-conforming petition, and sent Rapozo the form to complete. Rapozo did not complete or return the form. Accordingly, the circuit court dismissed the non-conforming petition. Rapozo did not appeal. 
2010 Parole Hearing 
On April 22, 2010, the HPA denied Rapozo's request for 
parole. HPA stated, "Your participation in work furlough while 
incarcerated will significantly enhance your success on parole." A rehearing was scheduled for January 2011. 
Second Habeas Corpus Petition 
On August 30, 2010, Rapozo filed an "Amended Petition 
for a Writ of Habeas Corpus" in federal district court. The 
federal district court transferred the petition to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals because "only the Ninth Circuit can authorize this court to consider a second or successive petition for writ of habeas corpus[.]" The Ninth Circuit denied authorization for a second habeas corpus petition. Order at 1, Rapozo v. Bennett, No. 10-73221 (9th Cir. Jan. 12, 2011). 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2011 Parole Hearing 
On March 28, 2011, the HPA denied Rapozo's request for 
parole because it was not convinced Rapozo could substantially 
comply with the terms and conditions of parole. HPA recommended that Rapozo "participate in work furlough." A rehearing was scheduled for February 2012. 
Seventh Rule 40 Petition 
On January 10, 2012, Rapozo filed a "Petition to 
Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner 
for [sic] Custody[,]" initiating S.P.P. No. 12-1-0003. The petition stated 14 grounds for relief. The circuit court dismissed the petition, finding that: 
All fourteen grounds raised by Petitioner were in fact
already raised and ruled upon either in Petitioner's directappeal, or in one of his four prior Rule 40 Petitions citedabove[
5] and their respective appeals. Even assuming,
arguendo, that any of the fourteen grounds were not raisedin Petitioner's prior Rule 40 Petitions or his directappeal, they are deemed waived as Petitioner has failed toallege facts establishing the existence of extraordinarycircumstances to justify the failure to raise them in theearlier proceedings. 
Rapozo appealed. We dismissed the appeal after Rapozo failed to 
file an opening brief. Rapozo v. State, No. CAAP–12–000054, 2013 WL 1490431 (Haw. App. Apr. 11, 2013).

5 The circuit court took judicial notice of Rapozo I and the records
and files in S.P.P. Nos. 5490 (the first Rule 40 petition), 93-0048 (the
second Rule 40 petition), 97-0016 (the third Rule 40 petition), and 08-1-0003(the fifth Rule 40 petition). 
6 In addition to the ten proceedings described above, Rapozo also
initiated proceedings that resulted in: Order [Denying Petition for Writ ofMandamus], Rapozo v. State, No. 29047, 2008 WL 923291 (Haw. Mar. 24, 2008);Order Denying Petition for Writ of Mandamus and Dismissing Action Pursuant to28 U.S.C. § 1915A(b), Rapozo v. Hawai #i, Case 1:08-cv-00191-HG-BMK (D. Haw.

9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2012 Parole Hearing 
On August 28, 2012, the HPA denied Rapozo's request for 
parole because it was not convinced Rapozo could substantially 
comply with the terms and conditions of parole. HPA recommended that Rapozo "participate in all RAD recommended programs." A rehearing was scheduled for July 2013. 
2013 Parole Hearing 
On July 29, 2013, the HPA denied Rapozo's request for 
parole. HPA stated, "Your participation in work furlough while 
incarcerated will significantly enhance your success on parole." A rehearing was scheduled for June 2014. 
Eighth Rule 40 Petition 
On June 9, 2014, a self-represented Rapozo filed 
"Defendant's Motion for Revocation of Restitution[.]" As 
summarized by the circuit court: 
In this, Petitioner's eighth Rule 40 petition, he
raises two general grounds for relief: 1) that his consti-
tutional rights are being violated by the Hawaii ParolingAuthority ("HPA") by their denial of parole due to hisnon-payment of restitution, and secondarily that his resti-tution has been more than satisfied under HRS §§ 706-644["Consequences of nonpayment; imprisonment for contumaciousnonpayment; summary collection"] and 706-645 ["Revocation offine or restitution"] and should be "revoked;" [sic] and2) that his sentence is illegal because a) he was sentencedto an extended term of imprisonment when he received a lifeterm with parole instead of twenty years; b) restitution wasnot an authorized sentence for murder under HRS §§ 706-605(1978) and 706-606 (1976); and c) even if it was, the courtcould not delegate the determination of the manner ofpayment to the Department of Social Services and Housing. 
The circuit court construed the motion as a non-
conforming HRPP Rule 40(c)(2) petition for post-conviction relief 
and initiated S.P.P. No. 14-1-0016. As it had done in the past, the circuit court sent HRPP Forms A and B to Rapozo.   On 
July 18, 2014, Rapozo filed the "Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, 7
7 HRPP Rule 40(c)(1) provides, in relevant part: "The petition shall
be in substantially the form annexed to these rules." 
10 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner from Custody" (2014 
Rule 40 Petition) which is at issue in this appeal. The 2014 
Rule 40 Petition incorporated the Motion for Revocation of 
Restitution. 
Respondent-Appellee State of Hawai# i — through the 
Office of the Prosecuting Attorney of the City and County of Honolulu — requested and received two extensions of time to respond to Rapozo's petition. 
The declaration submitted in 
support of the second extension stated: "Declarant was recently informed of a policy change regarding restitution matters, an issue raised in the Petition, which could affect the State's response." The State's answer to the 2014 Rule 40 Petition was filed by the Prosecuting Attorney's office on January 29, 2015. It contained 22 appendices setting forth most of the background described above. It did not mention any "policy change regarding restitution matters[.]" 
On April 4, 2016, the State — through its Attorney 
General — filed an answer to the 2014 Rule 40 Petition.
8 Rapozo 
moved to strike the Attorney General's answer; his motion also responded to the Attorney General's substantive arguments. The record does not contain a ruling by the circuit court on Rapozo's motion to strike. On April 29, 2016, the Attorney General submitted a declaration of then-HPA administrator Tommy Johnson and additional documents in support of its answer to the 2014 Rule 40 Petition. The additional documents included HPA denials of parole for 2014, 2015, and 2016. 
On June 21, 2016, the circuit court entered the Order 
Denying Rule 40 Petition without conducting a hearing. This appeal followed. 
8 The Attorney General's office maintained that it was not served
with the 2014 Rule 40 Petition until February 18, 2016, when it received a
filed copy from the circuit court. In response, Rapozo submitted a copy ofhis Saguaro Correctional Center Inmate Mail History showing that he mailedlegal documents to the circuit court, the Attorney General's office, and theProsecuting Attorney's office on January 13, 2015. It appears from the recordthat the legal document served on January 13, 2015, was actually Rapozo'smotion to schedule a hearing on the 2014 Rule 40 Petition, not the petitionitself.

STANDARD OF REVIEW 
We review an order denying an HRPP Rule 40 petition 
without a hearing de novo, using the right/wrong standard of 
review. Dan v. State, 76 Hawai# i 423, 427, 879 P.2d 528, 532 
(1994). 
"The question on appeal of a denial of a Rule 40 
petition without a hearing is whether the trial record indicates that Petitioner's application for relief made such a showing of a colorable claim as to require a hearing before the lower court." Lewi v. State, 145 Hawai# i 333, 345, 452 P.3d 330, 342 (2019) 
(citation omitted). 
To establish a colorable claim of illegal 
sentence, the allegations of the petition must show that if taken as true the facts alleged would change the petitioner's sentence; however, a petitioner's conclusions need not be regarded as true. See id. 
DISCUSSION 
Rapozo's opening brief lists 14 points of error. We 
address them in order. 
(1) Rapozo contends: 
[The sentencing court] committed plain error by sentencing
[Rapozo] to pay [an] amount of restitution without firstdetermining the amount of restitution was one of which[Rapozo] could afford to pay. 
The "afford to pay" issue was not raised in either the Motion for 
Revocation of Restitution or the 2014 Rule 40 petition. We will not consider it for the first time on this appeal. Dan, 76 
Hawai# i at 431, 879 P.2d at 536 (holding that the court will not 
consider an assertion raised for the first time on appeal). 
(2) Rapozo contends: 
[The] Circuit Court of the First Circuit committed error by
delegating payment of [Rapozo's] Order of Restitution toanother person or entity whom [sic] was not the trier offact. 
The Judgment required that Rapozo pay "restitution in 
the amount of $11,109.33, the manner of payment to be determined 
12 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and handled by the Department of Social Services and Housing 
[(DSSH)]." Rapozo cites no authority to support his argument 
that the manner of payment of restitution must be decided by the 
trier of fact, and we find none. But cf. Apprendi v. New Jersey, 
530 U.S. 466, 490 (2000) (holding that "any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.") (underscoring added). 
Rapozo argues that the sentencing court erred by 
delegating determination of the manner of payment to DSSH, citing State v. Gaylord, 78 Hawai# i 127, 890 P.2d 1167 (1995). The 
circuit court noted that Gaylord was based upon State v. Johnson, 68 Haw. 292, 711 P.2d 1295 (1985) in which the supreme court held: "Without express legislative authority, the court cannot delegate the sentencing function to another person or entity." Johnson, 68 Haw. at 297, 711 P.2d at 1299. Johnson was decided 
after Rapozo's sentence was affirmed on direct appeal. To para-phrase the circuit court, "The question, then, is whether the ruling in Johnson applies retroactively to [Rapozo]'s sentence on collateral attack." 
The controlling precedent is State v. Gomes, 107 
Hawai# i 308, 113 P.3d 184 (2005). In that case the Hawai# i 
Supreme Court adopted the analytical framework of the United States Supreme Court in Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288 (1989): 
In Teague v. Lane, the Supreme Court held that new
constitutional rules of criminal procedure that had not beenannounced at the time the defendant's conviction became final cannot be applied retroactively on collateral reviewunless they fit within one of two narrow exceptions. 
These exceptions exist if a new rule (1) "places certain
kinds of primary private individual conduct beyond the powerof the criminal law-making authority to proscribe," or(2) "requires the observance of those procedures that . . .are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty." 
Thus, in order to apply the [new] rule . . . retroactively,
we must determine that [it] is a new rule of criminalprocedure that fits into one of Teague's exceptions. 
13 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Gomes, 107 Hawai'i at 313, 113 P.3d at 189 (quoting United States 
v. Sanchez–Cervantes, 282 F.3d 664, 667 (9th Cir. 2002)) (reformatted) (second ellipsis added). 
Johnson announced a new rule — five years after 
Rapozo's conviction and sentence became final — that does not fall within either of the Teague exceptions. It cannot be retroactively applied to collaterally challenge Rapozo's sentence. The circuit court did not err by denying Rapozo's request for relief without a hearing. 
(3) Rapozo contends: 
[The] Circuit Court of the First Circuit committed error by
failing to address [Rapozo]'s factual Claims [sic] ofrestitution challenge brought pursuant to HRS § 706-645within the instant Petition on appeal. 
The circuit court's Order Denying Rule 40 Petition cited HRS 
§ 706-655 rather than HRS § 706-645, but the text of the order quotes HRS § 706-645 and shows that the circuit court's reference to HRS § 706-655 was a typographical error. 
HRS § 706-645 (2014) provides: 
(1) A defendant who has been sentenced to pay a fine or
restitution and who is not in contumacious default in the 
payment thereof may at any time petition the court whichsentenced the defendant for a revocation of the fine or restitution or of any unpaid portion thereof. 
(2) If it appears to the satisfaction of the court
that the circumstances which warranted the imposition of thefine or restitution have changed, or that it would otherwisebe unjust to require payment, the court may revoke the fineor restitution or the unpaid portion thereof in whole or inpart. Prior to revocation, the court shall afford theprosecuting attorney an opportunity to be heard. 
(Underscoring added.) The statute authorizes the circuit court 
"to alter, amend, or revoke restitution orders on the basis of unforeseen or changed circumstances[.]" Gaylord, 78 Haw. at 153 
n.50, 890 P.2d at 1193 n.50. A petition under HRPP Rule 40 is the appropriate way to seek relief under HRS § 706-645. See 
State v. Kealoha, 142 Hawai# i 46, 63, 414 P.3d 98, 115 (2018). 
The circuit court held that Rapozo "presented absolutely no evidence of a change in circumstances or that requiring payment 
14  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
would be unjust." On the record before us, we agree. The 
circuit court did not err by denying Rapozo's request for relief under HRS § 706-645 without a hearing. 
(4) Rapozo contends: 
[The] Circuit Court of the First Circuit committed error by
determining that restitution requirement pertaining to the"amount of restitution must be one in which defendant can afford to pay" was not a requirement available to [Rapozo]in the year 1979. 
As stated in section (1), the "afford to pay" issue was not 
raised in the 2014 HRPP Rule 40 Petition; the issue raised (in the Motion for Revocation of Restitution) was whether the sentencing court improperly delegated "the determination of the manner of payment of restitution to another person or entity." We will not consider the "afford to pay" issue for the first time on appeal. Dan, 76 Hawai# i at 431, 879 P.2d at 536. 
(5) Rapozo contends: 
[The] Hawaii Paroling Authority, by Order, has committed
error in disallowing [Rapozo]'s possibility of parole fornon-payment of a fee, fine or restitution. 
The circuit court found that the record contains "no 
evidence to support the conclusion that [Rapozo] has been denied 
parole due to his nonpayment of restitution[.]"9 HPA's October 
9, 1979 "Notice and Order Fixing Minimum Term(s) of Imprisonment" (Appendix D to Rapozo's Motion for Revocation of Restitution) did state that "Parole shall not be granted until judgement [sic] of restitution is satisfied." However, none of the 11 HPA parole decisions in the record makes any reference to payment of restitution as a condition of parole. In addition, this argument has been waived. It challenges an HPA parole decision; it does 
9 Appended to Rapozo's reply brief were several documents purporting
to show that he is being denied parole because has not satisfied his sentence
of restitution. None of those documents were presented to the circuit courtwith Rapozo's 2014 Rule 40 Petition, so we cannot consider them on thisappeal. See Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure ( HRAP ) Rule 28(b)(10)
("Anything that is not part of the record shall not be appended to thebrief[.]"). 
15 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
not implicate an illegal sentence imposed by the circuit court, 
it was not raised in any of Rapozo's seven previous HRPP Rule 40 petitions, and Rapozo has not shown "the existence of extra-ordinary circumstances to justify [his] failure to raise the issue" previously. See HRPP Rule 40(a)(3). The circuit court 
did not err by denying Rapozo's request for relief without a hearing. 
(6) Rapozo contends: 
[The] Hawaii Paroling Authority has committed error by
denying [Rapozo] parole repeatedly within the past 13 yearsfor reason of "RAD recommendations" (Reception Assessment &Diagnostics) — in that, [Rapozo] has never been returned toHawaii by the Department of Public Safety to participate in,nor [sic] complete this "Hawaii Program" which did not existprior to [Rapozo]'s removal from the State by the State ofHawaii Department of Public Safety. 
This issue was not raised in either the Motion for 
Revocation of Restitution or the 2014 Rule 40 petition. We will 
not consider it for the first time on appeal. Dan, 76 Hawai# i at 
431, 879 P.2d at 536. 
(7) Rapozo contends: 
[The] Hawaii Paroling Authority has committed error by
denying [Rapozo] parole repeatedly within the past 13 yearsfor failure to complete or participate in Work FurloughProgram . . . when this program is only available in theState of Hawaii . . . and, [Rapozo] has not ever beenreturned to the State of Hawaii to be able to participate inthis "Hawaii" program. 
The State contends this issue was not raised below, but 
it is mentioned in passing on page 10 of Rapozo's Motion for 
Revocation of Restitution, and we construe Rapozo's pleadings liberally because he is self-represented. The record shows that Rapozo was denied parole in every year from 2006 (when he became eligible) until 2016. The documents show that parole was denied in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2016 because HPA "is not convinced that [Rapozo] can substantially comply with the terms and conditions of parole." 
16 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The 2010 and 2013 denials stated: 
REASON FOR DENIAL: Your participation in work furlough
while incarcerated will significantly enhance your successon parole. 
These denials were not based upon Rapozo's failure to participate 
in the work furlough program; they are consistent with a con-tinuing assessment by HPA that Rapozo is unable to "substantially comply with the terms and conditions of parole[,]" but that his participation in work furlough programs would "significantly enhance" his ability to "substantially comply with the terms and conditions of parole." The circuit court did not err by denying this claim without a hearing. 
(8) Rapozo contends: 
[The] Hawaii Paroling Authority has committed prejudicial
error in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes § 353H-7 and§ 706-670 in not returning [Rapozo] to the State of Hawaiito participate in Work Furlough program for reasons giventhat, "no room" existed on approximately 40 plane flights toreturn [Rapozo] to Hawaii, or that the program was "toofull" for the past 13 years to accommodate [Rapozo]. 
These issues were not raised in either the Motion for 
Revocation of Restitution or the 2014 Rule 40 petition. We will 
not consider them on this appeal. Dan, 76 Hawai# i at 431, 879 
P.2d at 536. 
(9) Rapozo contends: 
It was error of the Circuit Court of the First Circuit to 
allow extremely late response to [Rapozo]'s Petition by theState of Hawaii Attorney General without their submittal[sic] and approval of Leave to Respond. 
Rapozo's opening brief contains no argument on this 
point, which we deem waived. See HRAP Rule 28(b)(7) ("Points not 
argued may be deemed waived."). 
(10) Rapozo contends: 
It was error of the Circuit Court of the First Circuit not 
to address the perjury committed by Hawaii ParolingAuthority Administrator Tommy Johnson within swornaffidavit. 
17 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Johnson did not swear out an affidavit; he signed a 
declaration under penalty of perjury. The State argues that 
Rapozo's claim of perjury is "not supported by the evidence" but concedes that "Mr. Johnson may have been misled by Rapozo's criminal record."  The issue before the circuit court was 
whether the factual allegations in the 2014 HRPP Rule 40 Petition, if taken as true, established a colorable claim of illegal sentence. See Lewi, 145 Hawai# i at 345, 452 P.3d at 342. 
The veracity of Johnson's declaration, or lack thereof, was not material to that determination. The circuit court did not need to address Rapozo's allegations of perjury to properly rule on Rapozo's 2014 HRPP Rule 40 Petition. 10
(11) Rapozo contends: 
It was constitutional error to sentence [Rapozo] to Hawaii
Revised Statute § 706-606(b) which allowed arbitraryselection of multiple punishments without specificdifferentiating [sic] elements of legislative instructiondepicting separation of higher and lower degrees ofpunishment. 
When Rapozo was sentenced, HRS § 706-606 provided, in 
relevant part: 
§ 706-606 Sentence for offense of murder.  The court 
shall sentence a person who has been convicted of murder toan indeterminate term of imprisonment. In such cases the court shall impose the maximum length of imprisonment asfollows: 
. . . . 
(b) Life imprisonment with possibility of parole ortwenty years as the court determines, in allother cases. 
The minimum length of imprisonment
shall be determined by the Hawaii parolingauthority in accordance with section 706-669. 
Rapozo argues that the option to sentence a defendant 
to "[l]ife imprisonment with the possibility of parole or twenty 
10 Johnson's declaration incorrectly states that Rapozo "was serving
a concurrent sentence for a federal offense at a federal prison when hisminimum term expired[.]" The record does not show that Rapozo was convictedof a federal offense; he was transferred to a federal prison after he wasinvolved in a riot at the H âlawa Correctional Facility. 
18 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
years as the court determines" is illegal because it "provides no 
specific legislative intent as to which punishment application of the greater 'life with the possibility of parole', [sic] or lesser 'twenty year' punishments is to occur[.]". The same argument was made by the defendant in State v. Heard, 64 Haw. 193, 638 P.2d 307 (1981). In that case the Hawai# i Supreme Court 
held: 
Appellant argues that [§] 706-606 is unconstitutional
because it fails to set forth criteria for a sentencing
judge to consider before imposing a life sentence or atwenty-year sentence. We find no merit to his argument. As we read [§] 706-606, it requires the sentencing judge toimpose the maximum penalty of life imprisonment withpossibility of parole, except that the sentencing judge isgiven the discretion to reduce it to twenty years if thereare mitigating factors or circumstances which would warranta lesser sentence. We find no constitutional infirmity insuch a sentencing scheme. 
Id. at 195, 638 P.2d at 309 (citations omitted). Rapozo's point 
lacks merit. 
(12) Rapozo contends: 
It was error of the Circuit Court of the First Circuit to 
determine [Rapozo]'s maximum term sentence; and, error ofthe Hawaii Paroling Authority to determine Appellant'sminimum term sentence when neither circuit court nor paroling authority were the trier of fact. In Appellant'scase Cr. No. 51915, jury was the trier of fact. 
This point is without merit. The circuit court is 
statutorily required to impose sentence. HRS §§ 706-605, 606. 
HPA is statutorily required to "make an order fixing the minimum term of imprisonment to be served before the prisoner shall become eligible for parole." HRS § 706-669. 
(13) Rapozo contends: 
[The] State of Hawaii has committed prejudicial error in
keeping [Rapozo] away from the State of Hawaii, and[Rapozo]'s family for nearly 40 years. [Rapozo] was unableto see his own mother prior to her death in 2016; and, hasbeen kept at distance away from those whom offer [Rapozo]the most support and assistance in a successful communityre-entry. 
19 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
These issues were not raised in either the Motion for 
Revocation of Restitution or the 2014 Rule 40 petition. We will 
not consider them on this appeal. Dan, 76 Hawai# i at 431, 879 
P.2d at 536. 
(14) Rapozo's final point of error states: 
[The] Circuit Court of the First Circuit has committed error
by not only denying [Rapozo] a hearing upon the submittedfacts of Federal and State of Hawaii Constitutional violation as mandated by Hawaii Rules of Penal ProcedureRule 40(f), but also failed to address [Rapozo]'s Claims[sic] of illegal sentence brought pursuant to Hawaii Rulesof Penal Procedure Rule 35 as being incorporated withinHawaii Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 40. 
Rapozo's point is unclear. HRPP Rule 35 provides, in 
relevant part: 
(a) Correction of Illegal Sentence.  The court may
correct an illegal sentence at any time and may correct asentence imposed in an illegal manner within the timeprovided herein for the reduction of sentence. A motion made by a defendant to correct an illegal sentence more than90 days after the sentence is imposed shall be made pursuantto Rule 40 of these rules. 
The Motion for Revocation of Restitution giving rise to this 
appeal was filed on June 9, 2014, more than 90 days after Rapozo was sentenced (on May 16, 1979). Accordingly, the circuit court did not err by treating the motion as a non-conforming HRPP Rule 40 petition under HRPP Rule 40(c)(2).
