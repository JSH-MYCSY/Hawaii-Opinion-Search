Upon review of the record, it appears that:

Defendant-Appellant Richard D. Eckerle’s (Appellant) second 
motion for leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis without prejudice to Appellant seeking reimbursement of appellate costs pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 39 
if he prevails on appeal, and ordered Appellant to pay, within ten days from the date of the order, the required filing and docketing fees, consistent with HRAP Rule 24(c). The court cautioned Appellant that failure to pay the filing and docketing fees may result in the appeal being dismissed; NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2) On November 9, 2016, after the court entered the
 
above-described order, Appellant filed a Declaration in Support
 
of Request to Proceed In Forma Pauperis, which the court
 construes as a third motion for leave to proceed on appeal in
 forma pauperis; and

 Appellant failed to pay the appellate filing and
 
docketing fees.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is
 
dismissed, pursuant to HRAP Rule 24(c).

dismissed.
