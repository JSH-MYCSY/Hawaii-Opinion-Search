STEVEN ROBERTSON, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
RICHARD D. ECKERLE, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 14-1-0166K)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Chan, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Richard D. Eckerle (Eckerle),
 
appearing pro se, appeals from the Final Judgment filed on
 
July 6, 2016, in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit (circuit
 court).
1 Final Judgment was entered in favor of Plaintiff-
Appellee Steven Robertson (Robertson) and against Eckerle as to
 claims of conversion asserted in Robertson's Complaint.
 
On April 24, 2014, Robertson filed a Complaint and
 
Summons for conversion of personal property against Eckerle.
 According to the Return and Acknowledgment of Service (Return of
 Service) dated June 4, 2014 and filed on June 5, 2014, Roland
 Perez (Perez), a process server, served Eckerle with the
 Complaint on May 30, 2014 at 3:25 p.m. "up Keopuka mt. rd. 1
st
 
st. on left, only house on left, gray warehouse looking
 building." The Return of Service (Return of Service) indicated

that Eckerle refused to sign. Eckerle did not file an answer to 
the Complaint. On November 3, 2014, the Clerk of the Third Circuit Court entered default pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) Rule 55(a)
2 against Eckerle. 
In response, Eckerle filed a Motion to Dismiss3 on
 
December 26, 2014 and two Amended Motions to Dismiss on
 December 30, 2014 and February 4, 2015, arguing that the entry of
 default should be set aside because he was not properly served
 with the Complaint. No other arguments were made by Eckerle. In
 Eckerle's Declaration, he stated that he was not at home at the
 time the papers were served:
 
Eric Yacopino was at [Eckerle's residence] on May 30, 2014 .
. . from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm watching his son and my son . .
. and cleaning a garage. . . . The man in a brown or gold
passenger car told [Eckerle's son] he was leaving some court
papers on the ground by the garage door about 60 feet from
the front door and unprotected. It had been raining and
when I got home to confirm there were totally soaked papers
that were completely destroyed and unable to be read . . . I
was not at home at the time the papers were delivered. . . .
Making it impossible for me to have been served and refuse
to sign.
 
Additionally, Eckerle provided declarations of three other
 
individuals supporting his argument that he was purportedly not
 at his residence at the time Perez stated that he served the
 complaint.
 
In Perez's declaration, he attested that he is a 
process server qualified to serve Complaints and Summonses on the island of Hawai' i and is familiar with the rules for service in 
the State of Hawai' i. He further stated that he had identified 
Eckerle at his residence and while he proceeded to serve him with the Complaint, Eckerle attempted to close the garage door,

 HRCP Rule 55(a) provides:
 
(a) Entry. When a party against whom a judgment for
affirmative relief is sought has failed to plead or
otherwise defend as provided by these rules and that fact is
made to appear by affidavit or otherwise, the clerk shall
enter the party's default.

 We construe Eckerle's Motion to Dismiss as a motion to set aside
 
entry of default pursuant to HRCP Rule 55(c). See Madden v. Madden, 43 Haw.
148, 149-50 (1959) ("Under the rules, the substance of the pleading controls,
not the nomenclature given to the pleading." (citation omitted)).

however, Perez was able to slip it under the garage. In his
 
declaration, Perez attested to the following:
 
4. Declarant was familiar with Richard Eckerle and
 
that he had a history of attempting to avoid service.
5. Mr. Eckerle was served by Declarant on May 30,
2014 at 3:25 p.m. The Return and Acknowledgment of Service
was filed June 5, 2014.
6. Declarant went up Keopuka Mt. Road; to the first
building on the left. It was gray warehouse looking
building.
7. Declarant recognized Eckerle and vice-versa.
8. As Declarant proceeded toward Eckerle he saw
Eckerle at the garage door, trying to close it as fast as he
could to avoid service.
 
9. As Eckerle was trying to close door [sic], there
was still about a 4-6 inch gap before the door was shut.
10. Declarant pushed the document into the door into
Eckerle and told him he was served.
 
11. Declarant did not leave the document on the
 
outside of the garage, nor did Declarant say to anyone that
he was going to leave it on the ground.
12. The only other person Declarant saw that day was
an unidentified young boy. Thinking it was Mr. Eckerle's
son, Declarant asked him if his dad was there.
13. The Declarations provided by Eckerle contains
numerous lies.
 
14. The court documents were not left in "an
 
unreadable mess", [sic] nor were they left "recklessly in an
area to be destroyed". [sic] The document was served into
 the garage, and not outside and unprotected.
 
After a non-evidentiary hearing on Eckerle's Amended
 
Motion to Dismiss on March 6, 2015, the circuit court entered its
 
Order Denying [Eckerle's] Amended Motion to Dismiss on April 15,
 2015.

and Vacate Default on April 24, 2015 (Motion for
 Reconsideration), which was denied on September 10, 2015.

denying Eckerle's motion on February 25, 2016. Final Judgment
 
was entered on July 6, 2016.
 
On appeal, Eckerle appears to contend that the circuit
 
court (1) abused its discretion when it failed to set aside the
 entry of default and default judgment for improper service and
 (2) abused its discretion by disregarding arguments and evidence
 advanced by Eckerle that warrant an evidentiary hearing and
 consideration of arguments regarding the merits of Eckerle's
 defense.
 
We note that Eckerle's opening brief fails to comply 
with various provisions set forth in Hawai' i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b), nevertheless, this court observes a policy of affording pro se litigants the opportunity "to have their cases heard on the merits, where possible." O'Connor v. 
Diocese of Honolulu, 77 Hawai' i 383, 386, 885 P.2d 361, 364 
(1994). Therefore, we address his arguments on appeal to the extent they can reasonably be discerned. See Hous. Fin. & Dev. 
Corp. v. Ferguson, 91 Hawai' i 81, 85-86, 979 P.2d 1107, 1111-12 
(1999); Hawaiian Props., Ltd. v. Tauala, 125 Hawai' i 176, 181 n. 
6, 254 P.3d 487, 492 n. 6 (App. 2011). 
"The application of HRCP Rule 55, which governs the 
entry of default judgment, is reviewed for abuse of discretion." County of Hawaii v. Ala Loop Homeowners, 123 Hawai' i 391, 404, 
235 P.3d 1103, 1116 (2010). 
[T]he trial court abuses its discretion if it bases its
ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly
erroneous assessment of the evidence. Abuse of discretion
 occurs when 'the trial court has clearly exceeded the bounds
of reason or disregarded rules or principles of law or
practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant.'
 
Ranches v. City and County of Honolulu, 115 Hawai‘i 462, 468, 168
 
P.3d 592, 598 (2007) (citations omitted).
 
The Hawai' i Supreme Court has held that "defaults and 
default judgments are not favored and that any doubt should be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief, so that, in the interests of justice, there can be a full trial on the merits." Rearden Family Trust v. Wisenbaker, 101 Hawai' i 237, 254, 65 P.3d 
1029, 1046 (2003) (citations and internal quotation marks 
4
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
omitted).
 
Additionally, Hawai' i courts follow the test as set 
forth in BDM, Inc. v. Sageco, Inc., 57 Haw. 73, 76, 549 P.2d
 
1147, 1150 (1976) (BDM, Inc. test) to determine whether to set
 aside entry of default and/or a default judgment:
 
a motion to set aside a default entry or a default judgment
may and should be granted whenever the court finds (1) that
the nondefaulting party will not be prejudiced by the
reopening, (2) that the defaulting party has a meritorious
defense, and (3) that the default was not the result of
inexcusable neglect or a wilful act.
 
Citicorp Mortgage, Inc. v. Bartolome, 94 Hawai' i 422, 438, 16 
P.3d 827, 843 (App. 2000).
 
In this case, Eckerle argues that entry of default and
 
default judgment should have been set aside because he was not
 
properly served with the Complaint and Summons pursuant to HRCP
 Rule 4(d)
7. "The general rule is that due process requires
 
notice reasonably calculated to apprise the defendant of the
 action and thus afford the defendant an opportunity to defend."
 Id. at 432, 16 P.3d at 837 (citing Calasa v. Greenwell, 2 Haw.
 App. 395, 399, 633 P.2d 553, 556 (1981)).
 
Additionally, service of process in civil actions and
 
proceedings is governed by Chapter 634, Part III of the Hawaii
 Revised Statutes (HRS). HRS § 634-22, provides that,
 
In all cases where any process or order of a court is served
by any officer of the court or of the police force or the
sheriff, deputy sheriff, an independent civil process server
from the department of public safety's list under section
353C-10, or any investigator appointed and commissioned by
the director of commerce and consumer affairs pursuant to
section 26-9(j), a record thereof shall be endorsed upon the
back of the process, complaint, order, or citation. The
 record shall state the name of the person served and the
 
7
 HRCP Rule 4(d) states in relevant part:
 
(d) Same: Personal service . The summons and complaint
shall be served together. The plaintiff shall furnish the
person making service with such copies as are necessary.
Service shall be made as follows:
 (1) Upon an individual other than an infant or an
incompetent person, (A) by delivering a copy of the summons
and of the complaint to the individual personally or in case
the individual cannot be found by leaving copies thereof at
the individual's dwelling house or usual place of abode with
some person of suitable age and discretion then residing
therein . . . .

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
time and place of service and shall be signed by the . . .
independent civil process server, or investigator making the
service. If the . . . independent civil process server, or
investigator fails to make service, the . . . independent
civil process server, or investigator in like manner, shall
endorse the reason for the . . . independent civil process
server, or investigator's failure and sign this record.
When service is made by a person specially appointed by the
court, or an independent civil process server, that person
shall make declaration or affidavit of that service
.
 
HRS § 634-22 (2016).
 
Further, under HRS § 634-22, a Return of Service
 
submitted by a process server as designated in the statute, is
 
prima facie evidence of the events which occurred at the time of
 service:
 
The record, declaration, or affidavit shall be prima facie
evidence of all it contains, and no further proof thereof
shall be required unless either party desires to examine the
. . . independent civil process server, . . . in which case
the . . . independent civil process server . . . shall be
notified to appear for examination.
 
HRS § 634-22 (2016).
 
In this case, although Perez certified, in his Return
 
of Service and affidavit, that the Complaint was personally
 
served on Eckerle, Perez did not state and the circuit court
 failed to make a factual determination that Perez is "an
 independent civil process server from the department of public
 safety's list under [HRS] section 353C-10" or that he qualifies
 as any of the other categories enumerated in HRS § 634-22.
 Accordingly, pursuant to HRS § 634-22, without this
 determination, Perez's Return of Service and affidavit attesting
 to personal service of the Complaint, does not create
 a presumption that service was effected.
 
Furthermore, Eckerle offered declarations of other
 
individuals that purportedly substantiated his argument that he
 was not served with the Complaint. Eckerle maintained that he
 was not at his residence at the time Perez stated that he had
 served the Complaint, while Perez attested that he is familiar
 with Eckerle, had recognized Eckerle at his residence, and that
 Perez had personally served Eckerle with the Complaint on the
 specified day and time. Based upon Eckerle's declarations
 rebutting proper service, Perez's failure to create a presumption

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
of proper service, and the existence of doubt that service was
 
effected, the circuit court should have held an evidentiary
 hearing where witnesses could be examined and the court could
 make a finding as to whether service was made on Eckerle.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Final Judgment
 
filed on July 6, 2016, in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit
 is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings,
 including an evidentiary hearing on a determination of whether
 Eckerle was properly served with the Complaint.
