IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
STACEY ANN YOSHIE NAGATA, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1DTI-16-003724)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER

 
(By: Leonard and Reifurth, JJ., and
Nakamura, C.J., concurring separately)
 
After a bench trial, Defendant-Appellant Stacey Ann
 
Yoshie Nagata was convicted of violating Hawaii Revised Statutes
 
("HRS") section 291C-102(a)(1), Noncompliance with Speed Limit. 
Nagata appeals from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order
 and Plea/Judgment ("Judgment"), filed on July 15, 2016, in the
 District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division ("District
 Court").
1
 
On appeal, Nagata contends that (1) there was
 
insufficient evidence to find that she violated HRS section 291CÂ­102 because there was no evidence of a posted speed limit sign or
 that she operated a motor vehicle; and (2) the District Court
 erred by admitting the laser gun's speed reading because the
 supporting testimony failed to establish that the laser gun was
 calibrated or used according to the manufacturer's recommended
 procedures, and thus lacked the necessary foundation.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the
 arguments they advanced and the issues they raised, we resolve
 Nagata's points of error as follows and reverse the Judgment.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
The District Court erred by admitting the speed reading 
from the laser gun because there was insufficient foundation for 
its admission. There was no testimony regarding (1) the procedures recommended by the manufacturer for testing the accuracy of a particular laser gun, (2) that Deputy Sheriff Raymund Calucag's training met the manufacturer's requirements, State v. Assaye, 121 Hawai
'i 204, 213-16, 216 P.3d 1227, 1236-39 
(2009), and (3) although Deputy Calucag stated that he performed calibration tests according to "the manual," there was no evidence that it was the laser gun manufacturer's manual. State v. 
Apollonio, 130 Hawai
'i 353, 361-62, 311 P.3d 676, 684-85 (2013) 
(concluding that admission of the officer's testimony was wrong because there was no evidence that the laser gun manufacturer produced the manual with training specifications). 
Without proper foundation, the laser gun speed reading 
should not have been admitted into evidence. Without the speed reading, there is insufficient evidence to find that Nagata was speeding in violation of HRS section 291C-102(a)(1). The State of Hawai
'i, to its credit, concedes that there was no evidence 
presented as to the presence or location of any posted speed limit signs and that the absence of that evidence "seems to warrant a reversal" of the Judgment. In light of the State's failure to provide the necessary evidence in support of the speed reading, however, we need not reach the State's concession or address Nagata's other arguments. 
Therefore, the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order
 
and Plea/Judgment, filed on July 15, 2016, in the District Court
 of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division, is reversed.
