IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
BENJAMIN EDUWENSUYI, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(HONOLULU DIVISION)

(CASE NO. 1DTA-16-00425)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai 'i (State) charged 
Defendant-Appellant Benjamin Eduwensuyi (Eduwensuyi) with
 
operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant (OVUII),
 in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1)
 (2007).
1/ At trial, the State presented evidence that a police
 
officer pulled over Eduwensuyi's truck after observing it being
 driven erratically, including weaving in and out of its lane,
 crossing over a double solid yellow line into the lane of
 oncoming traffic, and causing a oncoming vehicle to have to brake
 
1/ HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) provides:
 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle
under the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates or
assumes actual physical control of a vehicle:
 
(1)	 While under the influence of alcohol in an amount
 sufficient to impair the person's normal mental
faculties or ability to care for the person and guard
against casualty[.]

suddenly. While approaching Eduwensuyi's truck, the officer saw
 
Eduwensuyi climb from the driver's seat into the passenger seat,
 switching places with another occupant of the truck. The officer
 observed that Eduwensuyi's eyes were red and watery, his breath
 smelled of alcohol, his speech was "a little slurred[,]" and
 Eduwensuyi was unsteady and swayed while standing.
 
The District Court of the First Circuit (District
 
2/
Court) found Eduwensuyi guilty as charged.  The District Court
 
entered its Judgment on July 11, 2016.
 
On appeal, the sole point of error raised by Eduwensuyi 
is his contention that the District Court's "ultimate" colloquy as required by 
Tachibana v. State, 79 Hawai 'i 226, 900 P.2d 1293 
(1995), was deficient and therefore his waiver of the right to testify was invalid. As explained below, we conclude that the District Court satisfied the requirements of Tachibana and that Eduwensuyi validly waived his right to testify. We therefore affirm his OVUII conviction. 
I.
 
The record shows that the bench trial held by the
 
District Court and its post-trial sentencing of Eduwensuyi took a
 total of 50 minutes. The proceedings began at 3:17 p.m. and
 concluded at 4:07 p.m. The State called one witness and
 Eduwensuyi did not put on a case.
 
At the start of the proceedings, before the State
 
called its first witness, the District Court engaged in the
 following advisement of rights with Eduwensuyi:
 
THE COURT:  . . . . I want to tell you before the
trial starts today is that the court -- and I have to advise

you that you have a right to testify if you choose to do so.
 
THE DEFENDANT:  
Yes, Your Honor. 
THE COURT: 
And you also have a right not to testify.
That's up to you. I'll question you further toward the end
of the trial as to whether or not you want to waive either
of these rights, to make sure that you've been fully
informed of your rights and to make sure that any decision
you make is your decision, it's voluntary, okay. So your

attorney can give you advice about whether or not you should
or should not testify, but ultimately, it's your decision.
Do you understand that? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, Your Honor.
 
After the State rested and before the defense rested,
the District Court engaged in the following exchange with
 
Eduwensuyi:
 
 
THE COURT: . . . Does the defense -- would the
 
defense like to put on a case or --
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: No, Your Honor, we're going to
make a generic motion for judgment of acquittal, and then
we'll rest.
 
THE COURT: Very well. And let me just make certain
that your client understands that, sir, you do have a right
to testify if you choose to do so, as I said at the
beginning of the trial. And if you testify, though, the
prosecutor can cross-examine you and ask you questions. If
 you decide not to testify, the court -- I can't hold it
against you, nor would I, that you are not going to testify.
Okay, doesn't mean anything one way or the other to the
court. Do you understand these rights? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, Your Honor. 
THE COURT: All right. And have you consulted with
your attorney about whether or not you wish to testify? 
THE DEFENDANT: I like to take a second to do so right
now, sir. 
THE COURT: Pardon me? 
THE DEFENDANT: I'd like to take a second right now,
Your Honor --
THE COURT: All right --
THE DEFENDANT: -- to do so again. 
THE COURT: -- very well. 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, Your Honor. 
THE COURT: You have consulted with your attorney? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes. 
THE COURT: And do you wish to testify? 
THE DEFENDANT: No, I'm not --
THE COURT: Okay. 

THE DEFENDANT: -- Your Honor.

THE COURT: Okay, the court finds that the defendant
has been advised of his rights, has knowingly,

intelligently, and voluntarily waived the right to testify
or not to testify. Okay, thank you.
 
II.
 
In Tachibana, the supreme court stated that:
 
In conducting the [ultimate] colloquy, the trial court must
be careful not to influence the defendant's decision whether
 or not to testify and should limit the colloquy to advising
the defendant
 
that he or she has a right to testify, that if he or
she wants to testify that no one can prevent him or
her from doing so, and that if he or she testifies the
prosecution will be allowed to cross-examine him or
her. In connection with the privilege against
self-incrimination, the defendant should also be
advised that he or she has a right not to testify and
that if he or she does not testify then the jury can
be instructed about that right.
 
Tachibana, 79 Hawai 'i at 236 n.7, 900 P.2d at 1303 n.7 (citation 
and brackets omitted). 
Here, although the District Court neglected in its 
"ultimate" end-of-trial colloquy to advise Eduwensuyi that if he
 
wanted to testify, no one could prevent him from doing so, the
 District Court adequately covered this advisement in its pre­trial exchange with Eduwensuyi. Just prior to the beginning of
 trial, the District Court advised Eduwensuyi: "[Y]ou have a right
 to testify if you choose to do so. . . . And you also have a
 right not to testify. That's up to you. . . . So your attorney
 can give you advice about whether or not you should or should not
 testify, but ultimately, it's your decision." Eduwensuyi
 indicated that he understood the District Court's advisement.
 
Given the short time between the District Court's pre­
trial and end-of-trial advisements, Eduwensuyi's acknowledgment
 of his understanding of his rights, and Eduwensuyi's opportunity
 to further consult with his counsel before waiving his right to
 testify, we conclude that the District Court's actions were
 sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Tachibana. Under the
 totality of the facts and circumstances of this case, see State
 v. Han, 130 Hawai
'i 83, 89, 306 P.3d 128, 134 (2013), we conclude 
that Eduwensuyi validly waived his right to testify.
