On December 16, 2015 Defendant-Appellee Curtis K. Love
 
(Love) was charged with fraudulent use of a credit card and
 unauthorized possession of confidential personal information
 (UPCPI) pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 708-839.55,
 which stated in part, as follows: 

COUNT 5:  On or about August 27,2015, in the City and
County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, CURTIS K. LOVE,

did intentionally or knowingly possess, without
authorization, any confidential personal information
of [Complaining Witness], in any form, including but
not limited to mail, physical documents,
identification cards, or information stored in digital
form, thereby committing the offense of Unauthorized
Possession of Confidential Personal Information, in

 violation of Section 708-839.55 of the Hawaii 
Revised Statutes.
 
On July 12, 2016, Count 5 was dismissed by the Circuit
 
Court with prejudice. 
On appeal, the State contends the Circuit Court erred
 
in concluding HRS § 708-839.55 (2014) was unconstitutionally
 
overbroad, vague, and a violation of due process.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve the State's point of error as follows:
 
Love's March 29, 2016 Motion to Dismiss sought 
dismissal of Count 5 on three grounds: (1) the UPCPI was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague, thus, in violation of the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution and Hawai
'i 
Constitution; (2) the statute criminalized "mere possession of information absent any malicious intent to misuse that information," in violation of the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution and Hawai
'i Constitution; and (3) the 
charging instrument did not define the element of "confidential personal information" and the term is not readily comprehensible to persons of common understanding, in violation of his due process rights, i.e. the charge was insufficient. 
Love's Motion to Dismiss was granted on the basis that
 
HRS § 708-839.55 was unconstitutionally overbroad, vague, and a
 violation of due process but denied on the ground that the charge
 was insufficient.
 
In State v. Pacquing,  139 Hawai 'i 302, 310-17, 389 P.3d 
897, 905-12 (2016) (Pacquing II), the court held that HRS § 708­839.55 was not unconstitutionally overbroad. The court also held
 that a portion of HRS § 708-839.55 was vague and ordered that the
 phrase "a password or other information that is used for
 accessing information, or any other name, number, or code that is
 used, alone or in conjunction with other information, to confirm
 the identity of a person," be stricken from that statute. Id. at
 
319, 389 P.3d at 914. The Pacquing II court did not strike "a
 driver's license, a social security number, an identifying number
 of a depository account, [or] a bank account number" from the 
2

 definition of confidential personal information. Id. 
Count 5 did not specify the type of confidential
 
personal information that Love possessed in violation of HRS §
 
708-839.55. However, based upon Love's Motion to Dismiss and the
 State's Memorandum in Opposition, it appears the charge was
 related to Love's possession of the complaining witness's credit
 or debit cards. Possession of another's individual credit or
 debit card information constitutes unauthorized possession of
 information that is similar in nature to a bank account number or
 identifying number of a depository account. State v. Mank, CAAP­
16-0000342 (App. January 31, 2017)(SDO) at 6 (possession of
 another's credit card number constitutes unauthorized possession
 of information that is similar in nature and character to a bank
 account number or the identifying number of a depository
 account). Therefore, the Circuit Court erred by concluding that
 HRS § 708-839.55 was unconstitutionally overbroad, vague, and a
 violation of Love's due process rights.

Therefore, in light of these circumstances, we vacate
 
the Order Dismissing UPCPI Charge, and we remand the case to the
 Circuit Court for further proceedings consistent with this
 Summary Disposition Order.

2 The court notes that the UPCPI charge in this case is virtually
identical to the UPCPI charge in Pacquing II. The State in Pacquing II
conceded that the UPCPI charge was defective because it did not include thestatutory definition of "confidential personal information," and the supremecourt agreed with the State's concession and held that the charge was legallyinsufficient. Pacquing II, 139 Hawai' i at 308-09, 389 P.3d at 903-04. We
conclude, based on Pacquing II, that the Circuit Court also erred in denyingthe portion of Love's motion that sought dismissal of Count 5 on the groundthat the charge was defective.
