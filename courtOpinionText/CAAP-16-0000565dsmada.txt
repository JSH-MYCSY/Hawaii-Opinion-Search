ORDER
 
(1) DISMISSING APPELLATE COURT CASE NUMBER
CAAP-16-0000565 FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
AND
 
(2) DISMISSING AS MOOT THE
OCTOBER 18, 2016 MOTION TO CONSOLIDATE APPEALS
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
appellate jurisdiction over Third-Party Defendant/Third-Party 
Counterclaim-Plaintiff/Cross-Claim Plaintiff/Third-Party Plaintiff/Appellant Mitsunaga & Associates, Inc.'s (Appellant Mitsunaga & Associates) appeal from the Honorable Karen T. Nakasone's July 13, 2016 judgment as to one or more but fewer than all claims or parties pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Hawai
'i 
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP), because the July 13, 2016 HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified judgment does not satisfy the specificity requirements for an appealable final judgment under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2015), HRCP Rule 54(b), HRCP Rule 58 and the holding in 
Jenkins v. Cades 
Schutte Fleming & Wright
, 76 Hawai 'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 
1338 (1994). 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals from final judgments, 
orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641­1(c). HRCP Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." Based on HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i requires that "[a]n appeal may be 
taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" 
Jenkins, 76 
Hawai'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. "Thus, based on  and 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all
 
claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a
 separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai
'i 245, 
254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008); Bailey v. DuVauchelle, 135
 Hawai
'i 482, 489, 353 P.3d 1024, 1031 (2015). "[A]n appeal from 
any judgment will be dismissed as premature if the judgment does
 not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties
 or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP
 [Rule] 54(b)." Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. 
Furthermore,
 
if a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a case
involving multiple claims or multiple parties, the judgment
(a) must specifically identify the party or parties for and

against whom the judgment is entered, and (b) must (i)
identify the claims for which it is entered, and
(ii) dismiss any claims not specifically identified[.]
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (emphases added). 
For example: "Pursuant to the jury verdict entered on
(date), judgment in the amount of $___ is hereby entered in
favor of Plaintiff X and against Defendant Y upon counts I
through IV of the complaint." . . . . If the circuit court
 intends that claims other than those listed in the judgment
language should be dismissed, it must say so: for example,
"Defendant Y's counterclaim is dismissed," or "Judgment upon
Defendant Y's counterclaim is entered in favor of
 Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all other claims,
counterclaims, and cross-claims are dismissed."
 
Id. at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4 (emphasis added).
 
The instant case involves multiple claims and multiple
 
parties. The various multiple parties have asserted twenty-one
 
separately enumerated counts through six separate pleadings.
 The July 13, 2016 HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified judgment
 
(1) purports to enter judgment in favor of Appellee
DTRIC and against Appellee Hawaii Community
Development Authority and Appellant Mitsunaga &
Associates, but without sufficiently specifically
identifying which claim or claims among the
parties' twenty-one enumerated counts on which the
circuit court intends to enter judgment, and
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2) purports to enter judgment in favor of Appellee
Hawaii Community Development Authority and against
Appellee DTRIC, but without sufficiently
specifically identifying which claim or claims
among the parties' twenty-one enumerated counts on
which the circuit court intends to enter judgment.
 
Without sufficiently specifically identifying, on its face, the
 
claim or claims on which the circuit court intends to enter
 judgment, the July 13, 2016 HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified judgment
 fails to satisfy the specificity requirements for an appealable
 final judgment in a multiple-claim case under HRS § 641-1(a),
 HRCP Rule 54(b), HRCP Rule 58 and the holding in 
Jenkins, even
 
though the circuit court certified this judgment as to one or
 more but fewer than all claims or parties pursuant to HRCP Rule
 54(b). When interpreting the requirements (including the
 requirement to specifically identify the claim or claims) for an
 appealable final judgment under HRS § 641-1(a) and HRCP Rule 58,
 the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has explained that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality, . . . and we should not make such searches
necessary by allowing the parties the option of waiving the
requirements of HRCP [Rule] 58.
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (citation omitted; 
original emphasis). Absent an appealable final judgment that 
specifically identifies the claim or claims on which the circuit court intends to enter judgment, we lack appellate jurisdiction, and this appeal is premature. Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number
 
CAAP-16-0000565 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
 
-4­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that Appellee DTRIC's
 
October 18, 2016 motion in Case No. CAAP-16-0000565 to
 
consolidate appellate court case numbers CAAP-16-0000564 and
 CAAP-16-0000565 is dismissed as moot.
