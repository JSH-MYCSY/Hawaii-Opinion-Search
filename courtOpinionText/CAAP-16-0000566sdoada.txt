OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
CHRISTOPHER HIRAM HIMAN, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(FC-CR. NO. 14-1-0128)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge and Chan, J. with
Ginoza, C.J., concurring and dissenting separately)
 
Defendant-Appellant, Christopher Hiram Himan, Jr. 
(Himan), appeals from the "Judgment Guilty Conviction and 
Sentence" (Judgment), entered July 19, 2016, and the "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying Defendant's Motion to Dismiss for Violation of [Hawai' i Rules of Penal Procedure 
(HRPP)] Rule 48, and for Unconstitutional Violation of Speedy Trial Rights" (Order Denying Motion to Dismiss) entered on July 27, 2016, by the Family Court of the Third Circuit (family court).
1 The family court convicted Himan of Violation of an 
Order for Protection and Harassment by Stalking, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 586-11 and 711-1106.5. Prior to Himan's conviction, the family court denied his Motion to Dismiss For Violation of HRPP Rule 48, and for Unconstitutional Violation of Speedy Trial Rights (Motion to Dismiss).

 The Honorable Lloyd Van De Car presided.

On appeal, Himan contends that the family court erred
 
when it denied his Motion to Dismiss, specifically that the
 
family court improperly calculated the seventy-day period between
 September 16, 2015 and November 25, 2015, and the forty-eight-day
 period between February 3, 2016 and March 23, 2016, as excludable
 periods pursuant to HRPP 48(c)(3).

The appellate court reviews a trial court's denial of a 
Hawai'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 48 motion to dismiss 
under both the "clearly erroneous" and "right/wrong" tests: 
A trial court's findings of fact (FOFs) in deciding an
HRPP 48(b) motion to dismiss are subject to the clearly
erroneous standard of review. An FOF is clearly erroneous
when, despite evidence to support the finding, the appellate
court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a
 mistake has been committed. However, whether those facts
fall within HRPP 48(b)'s exclusionary provisions is a
question of law, the determination of which is freely
reviewable pursuant to the "right/wrong" test.
 
State v. Samonte, 83 Hawai' i 507, 514, 928 P.2d 1, 8 (1996) 
(quoting State v. Hutch, 75 Haw. 307, 328-29, 861 P.2d 11, 22
 
(1993)).
 
HRPP Rule 48(b) mandates the dismissal of criminal charges
if a trial on those charges does not commence within sixmonths, construed as one hundred eighty days, from the timeof the arrest or of filing of charges, whichever is sooner.
State v. Hoey , 77 Hawai 'i 17, 28, 881 P.2d 504, 515 (1994).
Pursuant to HRPP Rule 48(c), however, certain periods must
be excluded from the computation of the six month period. 
State v. Diaz, 100 Hawai' i 210, 222, 58 P.3d 1257, 1269 (2002) 
(quoting State v. Jackson, 81 Hawai' i 39, 50, 912 P.2d 71, 82 
(1996)). Under HRPP Rule 48(c)(3), "periods that delay the 
commencement of trial and are caused by a continuance granted at the request or with the consent of the defendant or defendant's counsel" are excluded in computing the time for trial commencement. 
In this case, 707 days had elapsed since the
 
commencement of the case on April 17, 2014, with the filing of
 the Complaint and Himan's March 23, 2016 Motion to Dismiss,
 
2
 Himan also includes in his Statement of Points on Appeal in the
opening brief that the time period from April 17, 2014 through May 28, 2014
and the time period from October 28, 2014 to January 8, 2015 should be
designated as includable periods for purposes of HRPP Rule 48 computation.
However, it appears from the record and the Order Denying Motion to Dismiss
that those periods were included in computing the time for trial commencement,
therefore we need not address these points of errors further. 
2
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
tolling the time for computation of trial commencement for
 
purposes of HRPP Rule 48. The family court concluded that 537
 days of that time were excludable periods under HRPP Rule 48(c)
 and therefore, there was no violation of HRPP Rule 48 as 180 days
 had not elapsed.
 
On September 16, 2015, Himan appeared with deputy
 
public defender Austin Hsu (Defense Counsel), who made the
 following representations in court:
 
MR. HSU:
 
. . . .
 Your Honor, with regards to this case we're gonna be
asking the bench trial be continued. . . . Mr. Himan's
 
gonna be waiving his right to a jury, uh, waiving his right
to a speedy trial to that date.
 
The family court continued the trial to November 25, 
2015. Himan argues that this period should be included in the 
HRPP Rule 48 computation because the continuance was necessary due to the State's untimely filing of a Hawaii Rules of Evidence Rule 404(b) Notice of Intent to Use Evidence of Bad Acts, on September 14, 2015, two days prior to trial and its untimely delivery of discovery consisting of a two-hour long video. However, in court, Defense Counsel failed to provide any HRPP Rule 48 argument or any explanation as to how the State's untimely submissions unfairly prejudiced Himan, and instead represented that Himan was waiving his right to a speedy trial. Additionally, Defense Counsel conceded that the 70 day period was excludable in Himan's Motion to Dismiss and at the hearing on the Motion to Dimiss. The family court's continuance was granted upon Defense Counsel's request, placing this time within an excludable period pursuant to HRPP Rule 48(c)(3). State v. Diaz, 
100 Hawai' i 210, 223, 58 P.3d 1257, 1270 (2002). 
Himan further argues that the family court erred by
 
failing to engage in discussions with him in court before Defense
 Counsel made representations that Himan agreed to waive his right
 to a speedy trial and therefore, Himan's waiver was not knowing,
 voluntary, and intelligent. Although Himan's waiver of his right
 to a speedy trial was conveyed by Defense Counsel to the court
 rather than by himself, there is nothing in the language of HRPP
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
48(c)(3) that requires consent from the defendant himself or a 
colloquy between the court and the defendant. See Diaz, 100 
Hawai'i at 223, 58 P.3d at 1270 (waiver in the context of HRPP 
Rule 48 only requires consent from either the defendant or the defendant's counsel). Therefore, the family court correctly excluded the days between September 16, 2015 and November 25, 2015 for the purpose of computing the number of days elapsed under HRPP Rule 48. 
Finally, Himan contends that the period of time between
 
February 3, 2016 through March 23, 2016 should have been included
 in the HRPP Rule 48 calculation because both the State and
 Defense Counsel agreed to continue the matter and the family
 court gave no further explanation as to the reason for the
 continuance. On February 3, 2016, the family court indicated
 that Himan was requesting a continuance, at which time
 Christopher Rothfus (Mr. Rothfus), appearing on behalf of the
 State, consented:
 
THE COURT: I understand counsel -- the defendant is
 
seeking another continuance of the scheduled trial; is that
correct?
 
MR. HSU: That is correct, Your Honor.
 
THE COURT: And I understand that as it turns out, the
State doesn't object only on account of its difficulties in
proceeding today; is that also correct?
 
MR. ROTHFUS: That is correct.
 
THE COURT: All right. Sir, the court is going to grant
your continuance, . . . 
At the hearing on the Motion to Dismiss, the State asserted that 
although it did not object to the continuance, there is nothing in the record to suggest that it was requesting a continuance and rather the State was prepared to proceed with trial. After review of the record, and for the reasons stated above, because the continuance was granted upon the request of Defense Counsel, this period was excludable pursuant to HRPP Rule 48(c)(3). See 
Diaz, 100 Hawai' i at 223, 58 P.3d at 1270. Therefore, the family 
court correctly excluded the days between February 3, 2016 through March 23, 2016 for the purpose of HRPP Rule 48 computation. 
However, the Hawai' i Supreme Court has recently 
4
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
clarified the application of HRPP Rule 48 in regards to a
 
Defendant's initial appearance and a district court's
 continuation to allow the Defendant to obtain counsel or a public
 defender:
 
When the district court initially sets a misdemeanor case
for waiver/demand hearing or continues arraignment for a
waiver or demand of jury trial, this time period is not
excludable from HRPP Rule 48 calculation under either
 
subsection (c)(1) or (c)(8)
.
 
State v. Choy Foo, 142 Hawai' i 65, 77 414 P.3d 117, 129 (2018).3 
In Choy Foo, the supreme court overruled this court's holding
 
that such periods of delay are excludable under HRPP Rule
 48(c)(8)
4 for good cause because the district court cannot
 
anticipate whether a defendant will have counsel or will need
 counsel appointed for them until his or her first appearance in
 court. Id. at 76, 77 P.3d at 128. The supreme court explained:
 
Although the district court faces uncertainty with
respect to individual defendants, it is "reasonably
foreseeable" that many defendants will make their initial
appearance in district court without an attorney. The
 district court can also foresee that indigent defendants
will not already be represented by a private attorney, and
cannot be represented by a public defender at their initial
appearance: it is the district court itself that issues a
referral to the public defender's office.
. . . [T]he fact that [the defendant] appeared without
counsel at his first appearance was not unanticipated or
reasonably unforeseeable, and therefore does not constitute
"good cause" within the meaning of HRPP 48(c)(8).
 
Id.
 
Here, Himan made his initial appearance on May 28,
 
2014, where he was first provided with a copy of the complaint
 
and was referred to the Office of the Public Defender. The case
 was continued to July 23, 2014, for further arraignment and plea,
 to allow Himan time to obtain counsel. In denying Himan's Motion
 to Dismiss, the family court concluded, inter alia, that "[t]he
 period of time between May 28, 2014 and July 23, 2014, a total of
 56 days, is excluded in computing the time for trial commencement

 State v. Choy Foo , 142 Hawai 'i 65, 414 P.3d 117 (2018) was decided by
the Supreme Court of Hawai 'i on March 16, 2018. 
4
 HRPP 48(c)(8) provides:
(c) Excluded periods . The following periods shall be excluded in
computing the time for trial commencement:
. . . . 
(8) other periods of delay for good cause.
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
as a result of the Defendant not being represented and seeking
 
counsel pursuant to HRPP Rule 48(c)(8)." Although Himan did not
 dispute this particular period of time, Himan did file an HRPP
 Rule 48 motion and, in light of the recent supreme court holding
 in Choy Foo, we conclude that the family court erred in excluding
 this 56 day period pursuant to HRPP Rule 48(c)(8). As such, with
 the inclusion of the 56 day period, more than 180 days had
 elapsed under rule HRPP Rule 48 and therefore, the family court
 erred in denying Himan's Motion to dismiss.
 
Based on the foregoing, we remand the case to the
 
family court for a determination of whether to dismiss the case
 with or without prejudice, applying the factors as set forth in
 State v. Estencion, 63 Haw. 264, 269, 625 P.2d 1040, 1044
 (1981).

Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the July 19, 2016,
 
"Judgment Guilty Conviction and Sentence" and the "Findings of
 Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying Defendant's Motion to
 Dismiss for Violation of HRPP Rule 48, and for Unconstitutional
 Violation of Speedy Trial Rights" entered on July 27, 2016, by
 the Family Court of the Third Circuit are both vacated and
 remanded for proceedings consistent with this order.

 In determining whether to dismiss a charge with or without prejudice
under HRPP Rule 48(b), the factors the court must consider include, but are
not limited to: "the seriousness of the offense; the facts of the
circumstances of the case which led to the dismissal; and the impact of a
reprosecution on the administration of this chapter and on the administration
of justice." Estencion, 63 Haw. at 269, 625 P.2d at 1044 (citation omitted).
