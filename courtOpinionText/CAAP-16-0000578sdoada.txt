SKY L. BREDE, Defendant-Appellant,
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CRIMINAL NO. 15-1-0907)
  
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Chan, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Sky L. Brede (Brede) appeals from
 
the “Judgment of Conviction and Sentence; Notice of Entry”
 
entered on June 27, 2016 in the Circuit Court of the First
 Circuit (circuit court).
1 The circuit court convicted Brede of
 
one count of Assault in the Third Degree (Assault 3), in
 violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707-712(1)(a),
2 and
 
sentenced him to one year of probation and one day of jail.
 
On appeal, Brede contends that the circuit court
 
improperly limited the questioning of the complaining witness,
 Henry Frazier (Frazier), thereby violating Brede’s right to

confront witnesses guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment of the 
United States Constitution and article 1, section 14 of the Hawai'i State Constitution. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we affirm.
 
Where a factual dispute exists as to who was the first 
aggressor for purposes of Hawai' i Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rules 
404 and 405, the extent to which evidence of the victim’s prior violent acts may be admitted is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. See State v. Basque, 66 Haw. 510, 515, 666 
P.2d 599, 603 (1983). 
With regards to the admissibility of a victim’s prior 
violent acts (including those reflected in the victim’s criminal record), the Hawai' i Supreme Court has stated: 
when there is a factual dispute as to who was the first
aggressor, a victim’s pertinent character trait is an
“essential element” to a claim of self-defense, and
therefore, evidence of specific instances of conduct
concerning that character trait, such as the victim’s prior
violent acts, may be admissible under HRE Rule 405(b).
 
State v. DeLeon, 143 Haw. 208, 215, 426 P.3d 432, 439 (2018). 
However, “[t]he admission of evidence of specific instances of
 conduct would still need to comply with HRE Rules 401 and 403.” 
Id. at 215 n.9, 426 P.3d at 439 n.9. The trial court has the
 discretion to determine to what extent, and in what manner,
 evidence of a victim’s criminal record may be allowed. Basque,
 
66 Haw. at 515, 666 P.2d at 603.
 
Brede’s case at trial rested entirely on his claim of
 
self-defense. Thus, the issue of first aggressor was essential.
 On the first day of trial, Frazier testified that Brede was the
 first aggressor. Thereafter, at a HRE Rule 104 Hearing, a
 witness to the altercation between Frazier and Brede testified
 that it was Frazier who was the first aggressor. In ruling on
 Brede’s motion in limine to admit evidence of Frazier’s assault
 conviction, the circuit court held that a genuine dispute arose
 as to who the first aggressor was. Accordingly, the circuit

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
court held that it would allow evidence of Frazier’s criminal
 
record for the limited purpose of addressing that issue. In
 doing so, the circuit court stated:
 
THE COURT: Now, I think any prejudice that the State
[of Hawai 'i (State)] could argue about this prior conviction
is substantially outweighed by -- you know, it is relevant
and it’s substantially outweighed by the -- the defendant’sright to be able to present a full and fair defense, aproper defense, and to help the jury determine this criticalissue: who threw the first blow. 
The circuit court clarified that it would be limiting this
 
evidence to the Assault 3 charge, of which Frazier was actually
 convicted, and precluding any evidence about the original charge
 of Abuse of Family and Household Member, of which Frazier was not
 convicted.
 
During Frazier’s direct-examination at trial, the
 
circuit court precluded defense counsel from eliciting (1)
 information about Frazier’s original charge of Abuse of Family
 and Household Member and (2) the fact that the victim in that
 case had been his daughter. In precluding defense counsel from
 eliciting information about the original charge for Abuse of
 Family and Household Member, the circuit court referenced its
 previous ruling at the Rule 104 hearing that only evidence about
 the Assault 3 conviction would be admitted for the limited
 purpose of addressing the issue of who was the first aggressor.
 The circuit court warned defense counsel to be specific in its
 line of questioning so as not to elicit information about the
 original charge and violate the circuit court’s previous ruling.
 Then, once Frazier testified as to having been convicted of
 Assault 3 in 2004, defense counsel asked who the victim was in
 that case. The State objected and the circuit court sustained
 the objection.
 
We conclude that, where it allowed evidence of the
 
Assault 3 conviction to suggest the violent nature of Frazier’s
 character, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in
 precluding information about the original charge of Abuse of
 Family and Household Member. On appeal, Brede contends that he
 should have been allowed to question Frazier further about the
 particulars of the conviction. Our review of the record
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
indicates that the circuit court did not prevent defense counsel 
from questioning Frazier about the particulars of the conviction. In fact, upon the State’s objection to the question about the identity of the victim in the Assault 3 case, defense counsel withdrew his question before the circuit court had even ruled on the objection. It cannot be said that the circuit court improperly limited Brede’s questioning of Frazier where defense counsel withdrew the question before the circuit court ruled on its admissibility. Although the circuit court ultimately sustained that objection, defense counsel did not attempt to ask any further questions on the matter. We further conclude that the circuit court’s decision to sustain the State’s objection was within its discretion. See DeLeon, 143 Hawai' i at 215 n.9, 426 
P.3d at 439 n.9 (holding that evidence of victim’s prior violent acts may be admissible under HRE Rule 405(b) where there is a factual dispute as to first aggressor, but the admission of such evidence would still need to comply with HRE Rules 401 and 403); Basque, 66 Haw. at 515, 666 P.2d at 603 (holding that where a genuine factual dispute exists as to first aggressor, trial court abused discretion when it flatly prohibited appellant from arguing to jury, or otherwise eliciting evidence of, deceased’s criminal history, but on remand, the trial court retains the discretion the extent to which evidence of deceased’s criminal record may be allowed). 
Thus, the circuit court properly limited the extent to
 
which it allowed defense counsel to question Frazier as to his
 assault conviction for the purposes of the first aggressor issue.
 
On appeal, Brede also contends that he was entitled to
 
cross-examine Frazier about his prior assault conviction to
 impeach Frazier’s credibility.
3 Brede did not present this
 
argument in the trial court as a ground for his request to
 question Frazier about his prior assault conviction. We
 therefore decline to address this contention.
 
3
 Specifically, Brede contends that Frazier’s testimonial statement
that he does not “go around hitting people” should have exposed him to
impeachment of his credibility, and thus, that Brede should have been allowed
to cross-examine Frazier as to the particulars of his assault conviction.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
We conclude that the circuit court did not abuse its
 
discretion in limiting the extent of defense counsel’s
 
questioning of Frazier about his prior conviction. Accordingly,
 Brede’s right to confront witnesses has not been violated.
 
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the circuit
 
court’s “Judgment of Conviction and Sentence” entered on June 27,
 2016.
