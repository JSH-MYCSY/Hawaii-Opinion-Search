APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 11-1-0182)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Ginoza and Chan, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Michael R. Pierce ( Pierce) appeals
from the Judgment entered on July 22, 2016 ( Judgment), in the
Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit (Circuit Court )1 in favor of
Plaintiff-Appellee Bayview Loan Servicing, LLC ( Bayview) and
against all defendants.  Pierce also challenges, inter alia , the
Circuit Court's Findings of Fact; Conclusions of Law; Order
Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment, and for
1The Honorable Randal G. B. Valenciano presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure, also entered on July 22,
2016 (Foreclosure Decree).
Pierce raises two points of error, arguing that the
Circuit Court erred by: (1) granting Bayview's April 1, 2016
Motion for Summary Judgment, Declaratory Judgment, and
Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure Against All Parties ( Motion
for Summary Judgment ) upon inadmissible hearsay evidence; and (2)
by denying Pierce's motion to continue the hearing on the Motion
for Summary Judgment.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, as well as the
relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Pierce's points of
error as follows: 
The issue of standing implicates this court's
jurisdiction, and, therefore, must be addressed first. 
Because standing is a jurisdictional issue that may be
addressed at any stage of a case, an appellate court has
jurisdiction to resolve questions regarding standing, even
if that determination ultimately precludes jurisdiction over
the merits.

419, 427–28, 134 P.3d 585, 593–94 (2006) (citation and footnote
omitted).
In Bank of America, N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo , the Hawai #i 
Supreme Court held in a judicial foreclosure action that in order
to establish a right to foreclose, the foreclosing plaintiff must
establish standing, or entitlement to enforce the subject note,
at the time the action was commenced.  139 Hawai# i 361, 367-70, 
390 P.3d 1248, 1254-57 (2017).  The supreme court stated, inter
alia, that "[a] foreclosing plaintiff's burden to prove
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
entitlement to enforce the note overlaps with the requirements of
standing in foreclosure actions as 'standing is concerned with
whether the parties have the right to bring suit.'"  Id.  at 367,
390 P.3d at 1254 (brackets omitted) (quoting Mottl v. Miyahira,
95 Hawai# i 381, 388, 23 P.3d 716, 723 (2001)).  The supreme court
further stated that "[a]s standing relates to the invocation of
the court's jurisdiction, it is not surprising that standing must
be present at the commencement of the case."  Id. at 368, 390
P.3d at 1255 (citation omitted).  In concluding that the
foreclosing bank failed to satisfy its burden as the movant for
summary judgment, the court reasoned:  "Although Bank of America
produced evidence that it possessed the blank-indorsed Note at
the time it sought summary judgment, a material question of fact
exists as to whether Bank of America possessed the Note, or was
otherwise a holder, at the time it brought the foreclosure
action." Id.  at 370, 390 P.3d at 1257.
In the instant case, Bank of New York Mellon Trust
Company ( Bank of New York ) filed a Complaint to Foreclose
Mortgage ( Complaint ) on August 12, 2011.  According to the
unverified Complaint, a promissory note executed on March 7,
2007, by Pierce in favor of Countrywide Bank for $825,000.00
(Note), was attached to the Complaint under seal.  The Complaint
alleges that Bank of New York is the current holder of the Note
by virtue of a recorded assignment of the Note and the subject
mortgage, but does not allege that Bank of New York possessed the
Note at the time of the filing of the Complaint; the Complaint is
not accompanied by a declaration attesting that Bank of New York
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
possessed the Note at the time of the filing of the Complaint.  
In addition to the Note,2 attached to the Complaint were (1) a
mortgage on real property securing the Note, executed on March 7,
2007, by Harry E. Williams (Williams ) as Pierce's attorney-in-
fact, in favor of Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc.
(MERS), as sole nominee for the lender Countrywide Bank, which
was filed with the Bureau of Conveyances on March 14, 2007
(Mortgage), and (2) an Assignment of Mortgage and Note dated
April 14, 2011, and filed with the Bureau of Conveyances on April
19, 2011 ( First Assignment ).  Per the First Assignment, MERS as
sole nominee for Countrywide Bank, assigned to Bank of New York
as the assignee and its "successors and assigns forever" the
Mortgage and "the Note referenced in said mortgage."  Pursuant to
these documents, the Complaint alleged that Bank of New York was
the owner of the Mortgage, alleged that Pierce and Williams were
in default, and sought to foreclose on the subject property.
Pursuant to a motion by Bank of New York, and based on
a December 24, 2014 assignment, Bayview was substituted as the
real-party-in-interest plaintiff.  Like the foreclosing bank in
Reyes-Toledo , Bayview was granted summary judgment and the
Foreclosure Decree was entered based in part on a declaration, by
Keli Smith (Smith), which attests in part, "Plaintiff is in
possession of the original promissory note."  Smith's declaration
does not establish that Bank of New York possessed the Note at
the time that Bank of New York filed the Complaint.  Like in
2It does not appear that the Circuit Court transmitted the sealed
document with the record on appeal.  However, we are able to review this case
based on the record before us.
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Reyes-Toledo, the evidence in the record fails to demonstrate
that Bank of New York was entitled to enforce the Note at the
time this action was commenced.  139 Hawai# i at 370-71, 390 P.3d
at 1257-58. 
Viewing the facts and inferences in the light most
favorable to Pierce, there is a genuine issue of material fact as
to whether Bank of New York had standing at the time this
foreclosure action was commenced.3  Therefore, under Reyes-
Toledo, the Circuit Court erred in granting the Motion for
Summary Judgment and entering the Foreclosure Decree, and we need
not address Pierce's other arguments concerning the adequacy of
the evidence or the denial of a continuance.
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's July 22, 2016
Judgment and Foreclosure Decree are vacated and this case is
remanded for further proceedings.

3Bayview does not rely on the attorney affirmation filed by Bank of
New York's counsel on June 5, 2013.  In any event, it appears that the Hawai #i
Supreme Court in Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Behrendt, SCAP-16-0000645, 2018 WL
1325153 (Haw. Mar. 15, 2018) implicitly did not give any evidentiary merit to
an attorney affirmation in the record in that case.  See Wilmington Savings
Fund Soc. v. Rohan, No. CAAP-17-0000433, 2018 WL _______ (Hawaii App. April
23, 2018)(Ginoza J., concurring).
