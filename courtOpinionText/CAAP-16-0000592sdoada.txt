CARLOTTA A. CISNEROS, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
KANE'OHE DIVISION
 
(1DTA-16-00585)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Chan, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Carlotta A. Cisneros (Cisneros) 
appeals from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and 
Plea/Judgment, entered on July 26, 2016, by the District Court of the First Circuit, K
ane'ohe Division (District Court).1 The 
District Court convicted Cisneros of one count of Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1) (Supp. 2016).

 The Honorable James C. McWhinnie presided.

 HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) provides:
 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if the person
operates or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle:
 
(1)	 While under the influence of alcohol in an
 amount sufficient to impair the person's normal
mental faculties or ability to care for the
person and guard against casualty[.]
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
On appeal, Cisneros argues that the District Court
 
wrongly convicted her (1) after failing to provide her with the
 
immigration advisement required by HRS § 802E-2; (2) after
 erroneously admitting into evidence (a) a statement she made to
 Officer Jason Akiona (Officer Akiona), during a custodial
 interrogation, where she was not apprised beforehand of her right
 to remain silent as required by Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436
 (1966), and (b) the results of her field sobriety test (FST),
 which lacked a sufficient foundation; and (3) based on
 insufficient evidence.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Cisneros's points of error as follows.
A.	 The District Court's failure to provide the
immigration advisement was harmless error.
 
Based on the plain language of HRS § 802E-2 (2014), the 
District Court was required to provide the immigration advisement 
to Cisneros "[p]rior to the commencement of trial." See 
Rule 11(d) of the Hawai
'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP); State 
v. Bayly, 118 Hawai 'i 1, 6, 185 P.3d 186, 191 (2008) (a court 
must give effect to a statute's plain and obvious meaning where the statute's language is plain and unambiguous). Although the court failed to provide her with the advisement, the error was 
3
harmless beyond a reasonable doubt  because she has not argued
that any special immigration consequences could result from the court's omission. 
See State v. Vasconcellos
, 139 Hawai 'i 350, 
389 P.3d 945, No. CAAP-16-0000216, 2017 WL 946632 at *2 (App. Mar. 10, 2017)(SDO) (failure of Third Circuit District Court to provide immigration advisement was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt where Vasconcellos did not argue error could result in any adverse immigration consequence to him); Bartholomew v. State, 
3
 HRS § 802E-3 (2014) -- which provides that when the trial court fails
to give the immigration advisement required by § 802E-2, the court must vacate
the judgment on motion by the defendant (1) in cases where the defendant pled
guilty or nolo contendere and (2) where the defendant shows that the
conviction may result in certain immigration consequences for the defendant -­does not apply where Cisneros did not plead guilty or no contest and has not
shown that conviction may result in any adverse immigration consequences to
her.

129 Hawai 'i 427, 301 P.3d 1268, No. CAAP-11-0000622, 2013 WL 
2301500 at *2 (App. May 24, 2013)(SDO) (Second Circuit District 
Court's failure to complete immigration colloquy was harmless where Bartholomew, who claimed to be U.S. citizen, did not contend that the excluded information was relevant to him and, consequently, that he was prejudiced).
B.	 The District Court did not err in denying the
motion to suppress, where Cisneros was not under
"custodial interrogation" when she said she was
driving.
 
Cisneros's inculpatory statement, "I was driving," was 
not the result of a custodial interrogation as based on the 
"totality of the circumstances," Cisneros was not "in custody." State v. Ah Loo, 94 Hawai
'i 207, 210–11, 10 P.3d 728, 731–32 
(2000). A person may be seized within the meaning of the Hawai 'i 
Constitution but not "in custody" for Miranda purposes in the sense that neither probable cause to arrest nor sustained and coercive interrogation are present. See Loo, 94 Hawai
'i at 211, 
10 P.3d at 732. 
Officer Dustin Akiyama (Officer Akiyama) testified that
 
before approaching Cisneros, he helped ensure the area was safe
 and set up traffic control, started the investigation, attempted
 to identify the owners of the other vehicles, talked to
 firefighters, and waited for Cisneros to be treated. 
Firefighters told him Cisneros had no injuries. Aside from some
 minor scratches and disheveled clothing, she appeared normal to
 the officer. Thus, although Cisneros had been in an accident,
 she had been treated for any injuries and had some time to
 recover and seemed normal.
 
Cisneros was sitting in the back of the truck, in
 
public view. There is no evidence that Officer Akiona's voice,
 body language, or position would have caused her to feel coerced. 
His two questions were brief and casual. There is no evidence
 that the firefighters and other officers on the scene were in
 close proximity to or interacting with the officer or Cisneros at
 the relevant time.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Further, Officer Akiona lacked probable cause to arrest 
Cisneros for OVUII. See State v. Kaleohano, 99 Hawai 'i 370, 377, 
56 P.3d 138, 145 (2002) (defining "probable cause"). Although he 
believed she was driving the truck and the truck had collided with the other vehicles, he had no information about the manner in which she had been driving. He did not begin to notice indicia of intoxication until after she made the inculpatory response and retrieved her driver's license. See Kaleohano, 99 
Hawai
'i at 377, 56 P.3d at 145 (the supreme court "has rejected 
the idea that police observations of conduct which was as consistent with innocent activity as it was with criminal activity is sufficient to support a finding of probable cause") (internal quotation marks omitted). Cf. State v. Melemai, 64 
Haw. 479, 482, 643 P.2d 541, 544 (1982) (Melemai subjected to "custodial interrogation" when he answered two questions by officer where as soon as Melemai answered first question, probable cause was formed). 
Officer Akiona did not have probable cause to arrest 
Cisneros for inattention to driving, in violation of HRS § 291­12, as Cisneros argues. See Kaleohano, 99 Hawai
'i at 377, 56 
P.3d at 145; HRS § 291-12 (Supp. 2016) ("Inattention to driving"). 
Officer Akiona engaged in a lawful "investigative 
detention," not a custodial interrogation. See Ah Loo, 94 
Hawai
'i at 211-12, 1 P.3d at 732-33 (Ah Loo not "in custody" when 
he was briefly detained to confirm or dispel officer's suspicion that he was violating HRS § 281–101.5 by possessing liquor in public place; officer's inquiry regarding Ah Loo's age was reasonable, noncoercive, and designed to make investigation as brief and nonintrusive manner as possible, and request for Ah Loo's name, age, and residential address were brief and casual). See also State v. Wyatt, 67 Haw. 293, 687 P.2d 544 (1984) (no custodial interrogation where officer who pulled over vehicle for unlit headlamp noticed odor of alcohol and asked driver if she had been drinking because officer had not been intimidating or coercive and had engaged in on-the-scene questioning of brief duration, in public view).

C.	 The District Court did not err in admitting
evidence regarding Cisneros's performance on the
Walk-and-Turn and One-Leg-Stand tests.
 
Even without the HGN test results there was
 
overwhelming, compelling evidence to support the conviction;
 
therefore, any error on the part of the District Court in
 admitting evidence of the test results was harmless. See State
 
v. Kam, 134 Hawai
'i 280, 287, 339 P.3d 1081, 1088 (App. 2014), 
cert. granted, No. SCWC-12-0000897, 2015 WL 1526201 (Haw. Apr. 2, 2015) and aff'd, 137 Hawai
'i 161, 366 P.3d 636, No. 
SCWC-12-0000897, 2016 WL 770253 (Haw. Feb. 25, 2016)(SDO); HRPP Rule 52(a); State v. Toyomura, 80 Hawai
'i 8, 27, 904 P.2d 893, 
912 (1995); State v. Sprattling, 99 Hawai 'i 312, 320, 55 P.3d 
276, 284 (2002). 
Officer Akiyama testified as a lay witness regarding 
Cisneros's performance of the FST and that she was intoxicated and unable to operate a vehicle. See State v. Ferrer, 95 Hawai
'i 
409, 429, 23 P.3d 744, 764 (App. 2001) ("It is permissible for a police officer to testify as a lay witness about his or her observations of a defendant's performance on various FSTs and to give an opinion, based on such observations, that the defendant was intoxicated."). The introduction of his lay opinion was based on a sufficient foundation. See Toyomura, 80 Hawai
'i at 
26, 904 P.2d at 911 (foundation necessary for introduction of officer's lay opinion regarding performance on FST). 
It does not appear that the court improperly relied on
 
any testimony by Officer Akiyama that Cisneros "failed" the Walk-
and-Turn test. When the officer testified that more than two
 clues of impairment on the test meant a "failure," Cisneros did
 not object. Later, when he testified that her six clues of
 impairment on the test meant she had "failed," she objected, and
 the District Court sustained her objection. At the close of his
 direct examination, the officer testified that based "off the
 [FST]," he believed she was intoxicated, and based on his
 training and experience, he believed she was unable to operate a
 vehicle. He did not state that either opinion was based on her
 "failure" to correctly perform any part of the FST.

D.	 The evidence was sufficient to support the
conviction.
 
Officer Akiona testified that he suspected the pickup
 
truck had collided with two parked cars. Cisneros told him she
 
had been driving the pickup truck. When Officer Akiona asked for
 her driver's license and vehicle documentation, she gave him only
 her license and stated that he could obtain her vehicle
 documentation from it. She appeared to be confused. Her
 responses were slow, and her speech seemed slurred. From about
 one-and-a-half feet away, the offer detected a "fairly strong"
 smell of an alcoholic beverage on her breath.
 
Officer Akiyama testified that Cisneros slurred her
 
words and smelled like an alcoholic beverage. During the
 instructional portion of the Walk-and-Turn test, she stepped over
 to the left with her right foot, which indicated she could not
 keep her balance. During the first part of the test, she missed
 heel-to-toe connections on every step, and on her ninth step,
 nearly stumbled onto another officer's car. Rather than making
 small, choppy steps to turn around, as instructed, she quickly
 pivoted 180-degrees. On her way back, she missed every heel-to­toe connection and on the eighth and ninth steps, raised her arms
 about ten inches from her sides. During the second, ten-second
 portion of the One-Leg-Stand test, she swayed about a foot from
 side to side and raised her arms about ten inches. Based "off
 the [FST]," the officer believed she was intoxicated, and based
 on his training and observations, he believed she was unable to
 operate a vehicle.
 
In light of the officers' testimonies, there was
 
substantial evidence to support the conviction. See e.g., State
 
v. Nakamitsu, 138 Hawai
'i 51, 375 P.3d 1289, No. CAAP-14-0001151, 
2016 WL 381475 at *1 (App. Jan. 29, 2016) (mem.); cert. granted, No. SCWC-14-0001151, 2016 WL 3152602 (Haw. June 6, 2016), and aff'd, No. SCWC-14-0001151, 2017 WL 2807977 (Haw. June 29, 2017) (sufficient evidence of OVUII where officer testified that Nakamitsu walked away from a single-vehicle accident, knelt down, said he had been driving the vehicle, began crying, emitted the smell of alcohol from his body and breath, tried to balance himself, said something like "I'm fucked, I'm fucked," and showed 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
clues of impairment on the FST; and another officer testified
 
that Nakamitsu had kind of red and glassy eyes and emitted the
 smell of an intoxicant).
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of 
Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, entered on July 26, 2016, by the District Court of the First Circuit, K
ane'ohe Division is affirmed.
