RICHARD J. MARIANO, Claimant-Appellant, v.
 UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC., Employer-Appellee, and
LIBERTY MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY, Insurance Carrier-Appellee
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
(Case No. AB 2013-484 (DCD No. 2-10-07753))
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Chan, JJ.)
Claimant-Appellant Richard J. Mariano (Mariano), pro
se, appeals pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 386-88
(2015) from the July 26, 2016 Decision and Order (D&O) of the
Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board (LIRAB or Board),
which denied additional temporary total disability (TTD) and
permanent partial disability (PPD) benefits relating to work
injuries Mariano sustained on August 30, 2010.1
Mariano argues that the LIRAB erred in affirming the
October 22, 2013 D&O of the Director of the Department of Labor
and Industrial Relations (Director and DLIR, respectively), which
awarded Mariano TTD benefits from October 12, 2011, through
1HRS § 386-88 provides, in relevant part:
Judicial review.   The decision or order of the
appellate board shall be final and conclusive, except as
provided in section 386-89 [ Reopening of cases ], unless
within thirty days . . . the director or any other party
appeals to the intermediate appellate court . . . .  The
appeal shall be on the record, and the court shall review
the appellate board's decision on matters of law only.  No
new evidence shall be introduced in the appellate court,
except that if evidence is offered that is clearly newly
discovered evidence and material to the just decision of the
appeal, the court may admit the evidence.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
June 3, 2012, and June 10, 2013, through October 6, 2013, and
denied Mariano's request for additional PPD benefits despite
being "certified" unable to work.
Upon review of the record on appeal and relevant legal
authorities, giving due consideration to the issues raised and
arguments advanced by the parties, we affirm LIRAB's July 26,
2016 D&O with regard to his lumbar injury and remand for
consideration of his neck and right shoulder injury.
As gleaned from his opening brief,  Mariano asserts
four errors, restyled herein for clarity.  The LIRAB erred in: 
(1) refusing to consider Mariano's stricken submissions;
(2) deciding that Mariano was not entitled to TTD payments from
October 6, 2013 to the present, despite being certified "off-of-
work" and not explaining how it derived this cut-off date;
(3) denying him PPD benefits for his lumbar injury; and (4) not
addressing Mariano's concerns about the accuracy and completeness
of the Director's October 22, 2013 D&O with regard to his neck
and right shoulder injury.2
1.The LIRAB did not err in striking Mariano's
untimely submissions.  Mariano asserts that LIRAB erred in
striking, and not considering, medical records filed past the
deadline set out in the LIRAB's Pretrial Order; however, this was
wholly within LIRAB's discretion.  Hawaii Administrative Rules
(HAR) § 12-47-22 provides for LIRAB's issuance of a "Pretrial
order" governing the conduct of proceedings, including the
submission of medical reports, and provides for sanctions for
noncompliance.  HAR § 12-47-22(b)(3) and (d).  "HAR § 12–47–1
provides that these rules 'shall be construed to secure the just,
2Mariano's opening and reply briefs are in wholesale noncompliance
with Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28.  While it is well-
settled that failure to comply with HRAP Rule 28(b)(4) is alone sufficient to
affirm, noncompliance does not always result in dismissal of the claims, and 
the appellate courts have "consistently adhered to the policy of affording
litigants the opportunity 'to have their cases heard on the merits, where
possible.'"  Morgan v. Planning Dep't, Cty. of Kauai, 104 Hawai #i 173, 180-81,
86 P.3d 982, 989-90 (2004) (citation omitted).  This is particularly so where
the remaining sections of the brief provide the necessary information to
identify the party's argument, Marvin v. Pflueger, 127 Hawai #i 490, 496, 280
P.3d 88, 94 (2012), and this policy is "most acute where . . . the litigant is
pro se."  Middleton v. Wong, 127  Hawai#i 241, 277 P.3d 335, Nos. 29164, 30618,
2012 WL 1688535, at *1 (App. May 15, 2012) (SDO).  Thus, insofar as they are
discernable, we will address Mariano's arguments.

speedy, and inexpensive determination of every proceeding.'"  Pua
v. Puna Certified Nursery, Inc., 133 Hawai# i 449, 329 P.3d 354,
CAAP-12-0000918, 2014 WL 2949443, at *3 (App. Jun. 30, 2014)
(SDO) (citations omitted).  
"Medical report deadline means the date that all
medical reports or records shall be filed at the [LIRAB]."  HAR
§ 12–47–22(b)(3) (emphasis added)).  "If the [LIRAB] sets a
medical report submission deadline in a pre-trial order and
consistently maintains that deadline, it is not an abuse of
discretion for the Board to disregard late-filed medical report
submissions."  Pua, 2014 WL 2949443, at *4 (citing HAR
§ 12–47–22(c); see also Tautua v. BCI Coca–Cola Bottling Co. of
Los Angeles, 127 Hawai# i 413, 279 P.3d 78, No. 30291, 2012 WL
2308162, at *2 (App. Jun. 18, 2012) (SDO) (concluding the Board
did not abuse discretion in excluding medical reports when the
Board amended initial pretrial order that controlled the course
of the appeal).  
Here, Mariano's stricken submissions were "medical
reports or records" subject to the extended December 9, 2014
medical reports discovery deadline.  Mariano apparently did not
assert a reasonable explanation for his failure to timely submit
his documents.  Rather, Mariano testified that he did not submit
the certificates of disability (COD) because he did not believe
it was necessary or that they were medical records.  LIRAB,
therefore, committed no abuse of discretion in striking Mariano's
untimely medical records.  
2.Mariano argues that he is entitled to additional
TTD benefits because he remains under Dr. Morioka's care due to
his inability to work as a result of the August 30, 2010 work
injury.   In addition, Mariano asserts that LIRAB "refused" to
consider Dr. Kimura's CODs in determining that he was not
entitled to TTD after October 6, 2013.  UPS argues that LIRAB
properly upheld the Director crediting Dr. Diamond's opinion, as
it was supported by substantial record evidence that Mariano3
3Mariano states in his opening brief that he was under Dr. Kimura's
care from August 30, 2010, to April 24, 2015, and with Dr. Morioka from
April 24, 2015, to present.

reached medical stability from the August 30, 2010 work injury as
of December 31, 2011, and was no longer entitled to TTD.  We
agree.
"'[T]otal disability' is defined as 'disability of such
an extent that the disabled employee has no reasonable prospect
of finding regular employment of any kind in the normal labor
market.'"  H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 418-70, in 1970 House
Journal, at 976.  "Thus, the legislature intended that total
disability benefits should compensate a worker for wages lost
when he or she is unable to find regular employment of any kind
due to a work-related injury[.]"  Ihara v. State, DLNR, 141
Hawai#i 36, 42, 404 P.3d 302, 308 (2017).
"Where a work injury causes total disability not
determined to be permanent in character, the employer, for the
duration of the disability . . . .  shall pay temporary total
disability benefits[.]"  HRS § 386-31(b) (2015).  TTD payments
are "terminated in two ways: (1) if the employee is able to
resume work, or (2) by order of the [D]irector."  Atchley v. Bank
of Hawai# i, 80 Hawai# i 239, 243, 909 P.2d 567, 571 (1996) (citing
HRS § 386-31(b) ("The payment of these benefits shall only be
terminated upon order of the director or if the employee is able
to resume work.").  Under the second alternative, HRS § 386-
31(b)(1) provides in pertinent part:
If the director determines, based upon a review of medical
records and reports and other relevant documentary evidence,
that an injured employee's medical condition may be
stabilized and the employee is unable to return to the
employee's regular job, the director shall issue a
preliminary decision regarding the employee's entitlement
and limitation to benefits and rights under Hawaii's
workers' compensation laws.
Id. (quoting HRS § 386-31(b)(1)).
In general, "[a] workers' compensation claimant has the
burden of proving each of the essential elements of his or her
claim."  82 Am. Jur. 2d Workers' Compensation § 518 (May 2019)
(footnotes omitted).  In Hawai#i, the LIRAB requires the claimant
to establish entitlement to TTD benefits.  See West v. Forza
Retail HI, LLC., No. AB 2012-212, 2015 WL 13260079, at *9 (LIRAB
Jul. 28, 2015); Ruff v. Gonzo Dispensing Co., LLC, No. AB 2010-
449(K) (4-04-01048), 2012 WL 12949138, at *4 (LIRAB Jan. 30,

2012).
Furthermore, "the credibility of witnesses and the
weight to be given their testimony are within the province of the
trier of fact and, generally, will not be disturbed on appeal."
Tamashiro v. Control Specialist, Inc., 97 Hawai# i 86, 92, 34 P.3d
16, 22 (2001) (citing State v. Jenkins, 93 Hawai#i 87, 101, 997
P.2d 13, 27 (2000); Bank of Hawaii v. Kunimoto, 91 Hawai#i 372,
390–91, 984 P.2d 1198, 1216–17 (1999)).  Moreover, "a conclusion
of law will not be overturned if supported by the trial court's
findings of fact and by the application of the correct rule of
law."  Id. at 93, 34 P.3d 23 (citing Robert's Hawai# i Sch. Bus,
Inc., v. Laupahoehoe Transp. Co. Inc., 91 Hawai# i 224, 239, 982
P.2d 853, 868 (1999)).
Here, the LIRAB considered several CODs timely
submitted by Mariano; rehabilitation treatment plans and progress
reports from Roy S. Murakami, P.T.; interim reports, procedure
notes, progress notes, updates, and visit summaries from Dr.
Morioka; a physical therapy progress evaluation from Dayna S.
Kuwahara, P.T.; progress notes from Dr. Kimura; and a discharge
evaluation.  The March 8, 2012 discharge evaluation report
indicated that Mariano completed therapy and could work within
the medium-heavy demand level.
The LIRAB credited Dr. Diamond's April 16, 2012 opinion
that Mariano's condition became permanent and stationary by the
end of 2011 and he could return to work at that time with
restrictions prescribed in a Functional Capacity Evaluation
(FEC).  The Board further noted that on April 18, 2012, UPS
informed Mariano that he was eligible for vocational
rehabilitation.
Thus, the evidence before the LIRAB supported the
determination that Mariano was "able to resume work," meaning "an
industrially injured worker's injury has stabilized after a
period of recovery and the worker is capable of performing work
in an occupation for which the worker has received previous
training or for which the worker has demonstrated aptitude."  HRS
§ 386-1; see HRS § 386-31(b).
The record supports the Board's finding that Mariano
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
had not met his burden of proving that he was temporarily and
totally disabled due to his August 30, 2010 work injury beyond
October 6, 2013, when his TTD benefits ended.  Moreover, the
record and application of HRS § 386-31(b)(1) also supports the
Board's conclusion that Mariano reached a point of stability as
of December 31, 2011.  Therefore, the LIRAB did not err in
determining that Mariano was not entitled to TTD compensation for
his August 30, 2010 lower back injury beyond October 6, 2013.
3.As for PPD benefits, Mariano argues that the
physicians under whose care he has remained have not released him
to work and refutes Dr. Diamond's opinion that his condition was
stable as of the end of 2011.  Mariano also asserts that the
lumbar PPI rating was premature and should have been assessed in
conjunction with his June 4, 2012 through June 7, 2013 return to
work time period, although he does not explain why. 
PPD benefits compensate a worker for the loss of bodily
integrity, i.e., the loss of a physical or mental function.
Ihara, 141 Hawai#i at 42, 404 P.3d at 308; HRS § 386-32(a)
(2015).  While LIRAB generally places great weight upon a
physician's initial impairment rating, it is not the only
component of the Board's assessment.  Ihara, 141 Hawai#i at 43,
404 P.3d at 309; (citing Cabatbat v. Cty. of Hawai#i, Dep't of
Water Supply, 103 Hawai# i 1, 8 n.16, 78 P.3d 756, 763 n.16
(2003), as corrected (Dec. 8, 2003)).  LIRAB's decisions indicate
its consideration of factors other than the physician's
impairment rating, such as whether the complainant is able to
participate in the same types of hobbies and daily and work
activities as prior to the accident.  Id. (citing, e.g., Belanio
v. State, Case No. AB 2007-532 (1-03-10259) at 8 ("claimant's
inability to return to customary job resulted in 3% PPD");
Deponte v. City & Cty. of Honolulu, Case No. AB 97-624
(2-95-11372) at 3-4 ("claimant's inability to perform activities
of daily living resulted in 2% PPD"); Chi v. City & Cty. of
Honolulu, Case No. AB 2006-116 (2-04-01998) at 3 ("claimant
awarded 3% PPD due to inability to engage in recreational and
daily living activities").
Here, in rendering his third IME of Mariano, Dr.
6NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Diamond reviewed the medical and therapeutic reports regarding
Mariano's treatment and progress as well as his own physical
examination of Mariano, and while acknowledging that ongoing
continued home exercise and a brief return to physical therapy
was recommended, opined that Mariano could return to work with
the restrictions contained in his FCE and that his condition was
permanent and stationary.  Given the evidence in the record, it
was not error for the LIRAB to give weight to Dr. Diamond's
opinion and to find that Mariano's condition resulting from the
August 31, 2010 injury was stationary and ratable.
4.Mariano contests the LIRAB's finding that "there
is no evidence of permanent impairment of Claimant's neck or
right shoulder."  UPS maintains that the only permanent
impairment rating on appeal is Dr. Diamond's lumbar rating of 8%
and that Mariano did not submit a rating for his neck and right
shoulder; hence, he is not entitled to PPD benefits for his
cervical and right shoulder injuries.
The record before us is replete with documentation of
Mariano's lumbar, neck, and right shoulder injuries which arose
from the August 30, 2010 work injury.  See for example,
Dr. Diamond's April 16, 2012 IME report, which begins by stating
that "Mariano is a 46-year-old man who injured his neck and lower
back at work on 8/30/10" (emphasis supplied) and includes notes
in the "Medical Record Review" portion, which indicate neck and
right shoulder involvement as reported by the doctors and
therapists seen by Mariano.  Not only did Dr. Diamond not issue a
PPI rating, he did not address neck and right shoulder impairment
or treatment whatsoever in any IME report, despite acknowledging
that, at a minimum, injury to Mariano's neck was involved. 
Consequently, the evidence in the record does not support LIRAB's
conclusion that there is no evidence of permanent impairment
resulting from injury to Mariano's neck and/or right shoulder.  
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the LIRAB's July 26,
2016 D&O to the extent that it concludes Mariano is not entitled
to continued TTD and/or PPD for his lumbar injury, and remand for
determination of his entitlement to benefits for injury to his
right shoulder and neck resulting from the August 30, 2010 work
