2 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
For the reasons set forth herein, we hold that Porter 
waived her fraud claims in 
Porter I, including her claim to 
reopen a workers' compensation claim relating to an alleged 
May 13, 2003 injury. We also hold that the LIRAB did not err in 
determining that Porter failed to make the requisite showing of 
substantial evidence required by HRS § 386-89(c) to obtain the 
relief sought for her August 9, 2002, August 31, 2002, 
November 6, 2002, and November 8, 2002 workers' compensation 
claims. Accordingly, we affirm the LIRAB's August 10, 2016 D&O. 
I. Background 
A. The LIRAB's denial of Porter's claims prior to her first
appeal 
Porter asserted workers' compensation claims for 
alleged MCS injuries that occurred on August 9, 2002, August 31, 
2002, November 6, 2002, and November 8, 2002 (collectively, 2002 
Claims). Porter also filed a claim for an additional alleged MCS 
injury that occurred on May 13, 2003 (2003 Claim). The 
Department of Labor and Industrial Relations, Disability 
Compensation Division (DCD) denied compensation for Porter's 2002 
Claims and 2003 Claim. The LIRAB issued a decision on July 19, 
2005, affirming the DCD's denial of compensation for the 2002 
Claims (July 19, 2005 D&O). Porter then requested that the DCD 
reopen her 2002 Claims and 2003 Claim, which the DCD denied in 
its November 28, 2012 Decision (November 28, 2012 DCD Decision). 
In a September 17, 2013 Decision and Order 
(September 17, 2013 D&O), the LIRAB affirmed in part the 
November 28, 2012 DCD Decision, holding that Porter was not 
entitled to reopen her 2002 Claims and 2003 Claim because they 
were administratively final, since she had not appealed the 
LIRAB's July 19, 2005 D&O affirming the DCD's denial of 
compensation for her 2002 Claims, nor had she appealed the DCD's 
March 10, 2011 Decision denying compensation for her 2003 Claim 
(March 10, 2011 DCD Decision). The LIRAB further held that 
Porter's filing of allegations of fraud on March 24, 2011, for 
3           
           
         
             
  
          
             
               FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
incidences prior to March 24, 2009, were time-barred by HRS § 
386-98(f) (Supp. 2014).3 Additionally, the LIRAB stated that the 
time-barred allegations of fraud would not warrant reopening of her 2002 Claims or 2003 Claim because the DCD did not exercise 
its discretion to pursue the fraud claims on its own. However, 
in concluding its September 17, 2013 D&O, the LIRAB held that 
Porter's remaining allegation of fraud in her March 24, 2011 
complaint, relating to whether, by an October 1, 2010 letter, QMC 
committed fraud for any of Porter's 2002 Claims or 2003 Claim, 
was still left to be addressed by the LIRAB on appeal. 
On September 30, 2013, Porter filed a "Request for 
Reconsideration or Appeal" (Motion for Reconsideration) from the 
September 17, 2013 D&O. The LIRAB issued its December 3, 2013 
Order, denying the Motion for Reconsideration. 
In a separate December 3, 2013 Decision and Order 
(December 3, 2013 D&O), the LIRAB determined the outstanding 
issue of whether QMC's October 1, 2010 letter amounted to fraud 
which would warrant the reopening of Porter's 2002 Claims or 2003 
Claim. Ultimately, the LIRAB concluded that the October 1, 2010 
letter did not constitute fraud and affirmed the November 28, 
2012 DCD Decision denying Porter's request to reopen her 2002 
Claims and 2003 Claim. Porter subsequently appealed to this 
court from the LIRAB's September 17, 2013 D&O, December 3, 2013 
Order, and December 3, 2013 D&O. 
B. Porter I 
In Porter I, this court noted that, as best as could be 
determined, Porter relied on the fraud provision of HRS § 386-
89(b) (1993)
4 to support reopening her 2003 Claim. 2015 WL 
3 HRS § 386-98(f) provides, in relevant part, that "[w]ith respect to
the administrative penalties set forth in subsection (e), no penalty shall be
imposed except upon consideration of a written complaint that specificallyalleges a violation of this section occurring within two years of the date ofsaid complaint." 
4 HRS § 386-89(b) provides that, "[t]he director may at any time,
either of the director's own motion or upon the application of any party, reopenany case on the ground that fraud has been practiced on the director or on any 
4           
          
   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
1400787, at *2 n.5, *7 n.9, *8. We further determined that 
Porter's failure to include fraud arguments in her Opening Brief 
amounted to a waiver of the fraud claims for both her 2002 Claims 
and 2003 Claim. Id. at *7, *7 n.9. Therefore, we limited our 
review to Porter's contention that the LIRAB erred in denying her request to reopen her 2002 Claims without first addressing 
whether she satisfied the requirements of HRS § 386-89(c) 
(1993).
5 Upon review, we determined that, contrary to the 
LIRAB's holding in the September 17, 2013 D&O, an appeal of the July 19, 2005 D&O was not necessary to reopen Porter's 2002 
Claims under HRS § 386-89(c). Id. at *7. As a result, we 
concluded that the LIRAB erred in its September 17, 2013 D&O when it affirmed the DCD's denial of Porter's 2002 Claims without 
first addressing whether Porter's request to reopen satisfied the 
requirements of HRS § 386-89(c). Id. 
Accordingly, we affirmed the December 3, 2013 D&O based 
on our conclusion that Porter had waived her fraud claims. Id. 
at *7-8. We also vacated the December 3, 2013 Order and September 17, 2013 D&O, as they pertained to Porter's request to 
reopen her 2002 Claims under HRS § 386-89(c), and remanded the 
case to the LIRAB to determine whether Porter's request to reopen 
her 2002 Claims satisfied the requirements of HRS § 386-89(c). 
Id. at *8. 
C. The LIRAB's August 10, 2016 D&O 
On remand, Porter and QMC stipulated to forgo trial on 
the remanded issue and proceeded by the submission of post-trial 
memoranda. After reviewing the parties' submissions, the LIRAB 
made numerous findings of fact (FOFs) and conclusions of law 
(COLs) and issued its August 10, 2016 D&O, wherein the LIRAB 
affirmed the November 28, 2012 DCD Decision, as it related to the 
party and render such decision as is proper under the circumstances." 
5 HRS § 386-89(c) (1993) contains language identical to HRS § 386 -
89(c) (2015), recited supra . 
5           
             
              FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
denial of Porter's requests to reopen her claims. In COL 1, the 
LIRAB concluded that Porter was not entitled to reopen her 2002 
Claims because she had not presented substantial evidence of a 
change or mistake relating to her condition under HRS § 386-
89(c). More specifically, under COL 1(a), the LIRAB held that 
"the applicant has the burden of proof to justify a reopening 
under Section 386-89(c), HRS" and that the presumption of 
compensability in HRS § 386-85(1) (2015)6 applies to the question 
of compensability once a case is reopened, but not to the determination of an applicant's entitlement to reopening or 
review under HRS § 386-89(c). The LIRAB then held in COL 1(b) 
that Porter had not alleged a change relating to her physical 
condition, nor had she presented substantial evidence to support 
her request for reopening of her 2002 Claims based on a change 
relating to her physical conditions. The LIRAB further held in 
COL 1(c) that since it did not credit the various documents 
Porter offered in support of her claim that MCS was, is, or had 
become, a valid medical disorder, Porter had not presented 
substantial evidence to support her request to reopen her 2002 
claims based on a mistake of fact at the time of the July 19, 
2005 D&O. Finally, in COL 2, the LIRAB concluded that Porter's 
2003 Claim was time-barred, and in COL 3, the LIRAB concluded 
that Porter's fraud claims could not be addressed because the 
LIRAB previously denied the allegations of fraud and this court 
deemed Porter's fraud claims waived in Porter I. 
Porter timely appealed the August 10, 2016 D&O to this 
court on August 30, 2016. 
II. Points of Error 
On appeal, Porter contends that the LIRAB erred in its 
August 10, 2016 D&O by: (1) denying Porter's requests to reopen 
6 HRS § 386-85(1) provides: "In any proceeding for the enforcement of
a claim for compensation under this chapter it shall be presumed, in the absence
of substantial evidence to the contrary: (1) That the claim is for a covered workinjury[.]"

   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
her 2002 Claims under HRS § 386-89(c); (2) declining to re-
address Porter's fraud allegations; and (3) denying Porter's 
request to reopen her 2003 Claim on the grounds that it was time-
barred. Porter challenges FOFs 41, 46, 50, 53-80, and 85, and 
COLs 1-3. 7
III. Standard of Review 
Appellate review of a LIRAB decision is governed by HRS
§ 91–14(g). Igawa v. Koa House Rest., 97 Hawai# i 402, 405–06, 38
P.3d 570, 573–74 (2001). HRS § 91-14(g) (Supp. 2018) provides:  
 
§91-14 Judicial review of contested cases. 
. . . .
 (g)  Upon review of the record, the court may affirm the
decision of the agency or remand the case with instructions
for further proceedings; or it may reverse or modify thedecision and order if the substantial rights of the 
7 We note that Porter's Opening Brief fails to include appropriate
record references as required by HRAP Rule 28(b)(3). Instead of citing to the
record on appeal, Porter cites to exhibits appended to her Opening Brief, without
citing to specific pages. As discussed infra , there is at least one document
appended to Porter's Opening Brief in violation of HRAP 28(b)(10) because it does
not appear in the record on appeal. Additionally, despite there being sectionstitled "Standard of Review" within Porter's Opening Brief, the sections, exceptfor those pertaining to COLs 1-3, do not contain standards for the court to applyto review the issues on appeal. This is in nonconformance with HRAP 28(b)(5).However, Porter does make some references to standards in her "Argument"sections. 
HRAP Rule 30 provides in pertinent part that "when the briefof an appellant is otherwise not in conformity with these
rules, the appeal may be dismissed or the brief stricken and 
monetary or other sanctions may be levied by the appellate
court," giving an appellate court "discretion" to determinethe proper course of action[.]

Nevertheless, 
no
ncompliance with Rule 28 does not always result in dismissal
of the claims, and [the supreme court] has consistentlyadhered to the policy of affording litigants the opportunityto have their cases heard on the merits, where possible. This is particularly so where the remaining sections of the briefprovide the necessary information to identify the party'sargument.

fact that QMC was able to provide this court with a thorough response on themerits despite the deficiencies in Porter's Opening Brief, we address Porter'sarguments on the merits.

IV. Discussion 
A. The statutory presumption of compensability under HRS § 386-
85(1) does not apply to Porter's request to reopen where theissue is not whether the injury is related to a workaccident and the LIRAB majority properly considered whetherPorter made the requisite showing of substantial evidenceunder HRS § 386-89(c) in declining Porter's requestedrelief. 
In the August 10, 2016 D&O, there is a majority opinion 
and an opinion dissenting in part/concurring in part. A primary 
area of disagreement between these opinions is whether the 
presumption of compensability set forth in HRS § 386-85(1) 
applies to Porter's request to reopen her worker's compensation 
cases under HRS § 386-89(c). Both the majority opinion and 
dissenting/concurring opinion analyzed case law related to the 
issue, in particular Mitchell v. BWK Joint Venture, 57 Haw. 535, 
560 P.2d 1292 (1977) and De Victoria v. H and K Contractors, 56 
Haw. 552, 545 P.2d 692 (1976). Based on COL 1(a), recited infra, 
the LIRAB majority opinion seems to make two rulings. First, 
regarding an application to reopen a case under HRS § 386-89(c), 
the HRS § 386-85(1) presumption applies to whether an injury is 
work-connected. Second, any presumption applies only after a 
claimant meets the threshold burden to reopen the case. To the 
contrary, the LIRAB concurring/dissenting opinion contends that 
the LIRAB majority opinion misconstrues De Victoria and Mitchell, 
and instead concludes that the presumption under HRS § 386-85(1) 
applies to Porter's "reopening applications[.]" 
On appeal, Porter generally asserts that the LIRAB 
majority erred in COL 1 when it "conclude[d] that [Porter] is not 
entitled to relief of reopening pursuant to [HRS §] 386-89(c) for 
her 2002 claims because she has not presented substantial 
evidence of a change or mistake relating to her physical 
condition." Porter also contends, more specifically, that the 
9 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
LIRAB majority erred in COL 1 by, 
inter alia, not applying the 
HRS § 386-85(1) presumption of compensability to her request to 
reopen her 2002 Claims under HRS § 386-89(c). 
The primary issue was whether Porter sustained an 
injury, i.e., MCS, not whether an injury is work-related. Given 
these circumstances, we conclude, for the reasons discussed 
infra, that the presumption under HRS § 386-85(1) does not apply 
in determining whether Porter is entitled to relief under HRS § 
386-89(c). However, to the extent that the LIRAB majority held 
that Porter was required to show substantial evidence to have her 
case reopened or reviewed, we believe this was error because the 
Hawai# i Supreme Court has interpreted HRS § 386-89(c) to require 
the showing of substantial evidence in order to obtain the relief sought, not for reopening or review of the claim for 
compensation. See Mitchell, 57 Haw. 535, 560 P.2d 1292; De 
Victoria, 56 Haw. 552, 545 P.2d 692. 
HRS § 386-89(c) provides, in relevant part: 
§386-89 Reopening of cases; continuing jurisdiction of
director. 
. . . . 
(c)
 On the application of any party in interest,
supported by a showing of substantial evidence, on the
ground of a change in or of a mistake in a determination offact related to the physical condition of the injuredemployee, the director may, at any time prior to eight yearsafter date of the last payment of compensation, whether ornot a decision awarding compensation has been issued, or atany time prior to eight years after the rejection of aclaim, review a compensation case and issue a decision whichmay award, terminate, continue, reinstate, increase, ordecrease compensation. No compensation case may be reviewedoftener than once in six months and no case in which a claim has been rejected shall be reviewed more than once if onsuch review the claim is again rejected. 
(Emphases added.) In turn, HRS § 386-85(1) provides: 
§386-85 Presumptions . In any proceeding for the
enforcement of a claim for compensation under this chapterit shall be presumed, in the absence of substantial evidenceto the contrary: 
(1) That the claim is for a covered work injury[.] 
(Emphasis added.) 
10 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In 
De Victoria, it was undisputed that the claimant 
suffered an acute lumbo-sacral strain as a result of a 1966 work 
injury and he received worker's compensation benefits until 
July 1967. 56 Haw. at 553, 545 P.2d at 695. In 1972, the 
claimant sought additional benefits by requesting review under 
HRS § 386-89(c). Id. at 554, 545 P.2d at 695. The LIRAB 
concluded that "[t]he present condition of Claimant's back is unrelated" to his 1966 work injury, and that a knee injury first 
reported in 1970 was not related to his work injury. Id. at 555-
56, 545 P.2d at 696. 
On appeal, however, the Hawai# i Supreme Court reversed 
the LIRAB's ruling regarding the claimant's back. 
In part I of 
its opinion, the supreme court first expressed the following: 
In support of the decision of the Board, the employer's
threshold position on appeal is that the claimant did notinitially present a showing of substantial evidence insupport of his application, allegedly required prior toobtaining a review by HRS § 386-89(c). We do not believe 
that a showing of substantial evidence is necessary as a
prerequisite to a review  by the Director or the Board of an
application under subparagraph (c) of HRS § 386-89. That 
subparagraph requires that the applicant for a review mustshow by substantial evidence "a change in or . . . a mistakein a determination of fact related to the physical condition
of the" claimant only to justify favorable consideration of
the application . 
Id. at 556, 545 P.2d at 696 (emphases added). Then, in 
addressing whether there was "substantial evidence upon which 
[the LIRAB] could favorably consider claimant's application with 
respect to his back injury", id., the supreme court held that the
record did not support the LIRAB's finding that within a year of 
the accident the claimant's back condition had returned to pre-
accident condition. Id. at 559, 545 P.2d at 698. In part III of
its opinion, the supreme court further ruled:  
 
Moreover, our holding that the Board's conclusion that
claimant's present back condition is not related to his 1966
work injury is clearly erroneous is heightened when weaccord proper emphasis to the statutory presumption of HRS§ 386-85(1) which we believe to be applicable. . . . [B]asedupon the record, there is no question that claimant is nowpartially disabled. Claimant's evidence was that this condition is due to the accident of July 1966, while theemployer offered only speculative argument to the contrary.

              FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In addition, HRS § 386-85(1) provides that it is "presumed,
in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary . . .[t]hat the claim is for a covered work injury[]". 
. . . . 
We hold that a proceeding brought by a claimant under
HRS § 386-89(c) is plainly a "proceeding for the enforcementof a claim for compensation under [our workmen's
compensation] chapter." 
HRS § 386-85. Where, as here, the 
primary issue is whether or not an injury is related to a
work accident , a claimant is entitled to the same
presumption on review of a case once closed that his claim
is for a covered injury as that in an original hearing. 
Id. at 560-62, 545 P.2d at 699 (emphases added).8 
One year after deciding De Victoria, the Hawai# i 
Supreme Court issued its opinion in Mitchell. There was no 
dispute that the claimant in Mitchell was injured in an accident 
in January 1970, when he was "struck in the lower abdomen and 
pubic region by heavy boiler tubes weighing between 1200 pounds 
to 1500 pounds," and he was awarded certain worker's compensation 
benefits in an initial decision which was not appealed. 57 Haw. 
at 537, 560 P.2d at 1294. 
Subsequently, the LIRAB issued a 
decision under HRS § 386-89(c) that the claimant had developed a scrotal hydrocele which was causally related to the 1970 accident 
and awarded additional benefits. Id. at 539, 560 P.2d at 1295. 
The employer and insurer appealed from this LIRAB decision. 
On appeal, the Hawai# i Supreme Court noted with regard 
to HRS § 386-89(c) (Supp. 1975): 
The provisions of this section authorize the director to
review a compensation case at any time within a period often years
[9] after the last payment of compensation or the
rejection of a claim, upon the application of a claimantbecause of a change in or a mistake in a determination offact relating to the physical condition of the injured
employee. Before the director may  grant the relief
requested  by the injured employee under HRS § 386-89(c)
(1975 Supp.), there must be a showing by substantial 
evidence  of such a change in or mistake in a determination 
8 Justice Kobayashi concurred with the majority, except with respect
to part III of the opinion. 56 Haw. at 563, 545 P.2d at 700. 
9 The  applicable  version  of  HRS  §  386-89(c)  in  Mitchell  provided  that
a  review  could  be  done  within  ten  years  of  the  triggering  events.   In  1985,  HRS  § 
386-89(c)  was  amended  to  provide  for  an  eight  year  period.   See  1985  Haw.  Sess. 
Laws  Act  296,  §  9  at  645-46.

of fact relating to his physical condition. 
Id. at 544, 560 P.2d at 1298 (emphases added). The supreme court
held that the LIRAB did not err in reopening the claimant's case.
Id. at 546, 560 P.2d at 1298. Further, with regard to the 
appellants' challenge to the LIRAB's conclusion that the 
claimant's hydrocele was causally related to the 1970 work 
accident, the supreme court reiterated its holding in De Victoria
that  
 
 
a proceeding brought by a claimant under HRS § 386-89(c) is
plainly a "proceeding for the enforcement of a claim forcompensation under [our workmen's compensation] chapter."HRS § 386-85. Where, as here, the primary issue is whether
or not an injury is related to a work accident, a claimantis entitled to the same presumption on review of a case onceclosed that his claim is for a covered injury as that in anoriginal hearing.

Permanente Medical Group, Inc., 94 Hawai# i 297, 306, 12 P.3d 
1238, 1247 (2000) (noting that the presumption under HRS § 386-85(1) "applies to the 'work-relatedness' of an injury"). The 
supreme court thus concluded that as to the LIRAB's findings, 
including that there was a causal relation between the claimant's 
scrotal hydrocele and his work accident: 
We think that these findings are reasonably clear,
especially in light of the presumption that "the claim isfor a covered work injury" in the absence of substantialevidence to the contrary. There is substantial evidence in the record to sustain the findings when we consider thepresumption in HRS § 386-85. 
Mitchell, 57 Haw. at 548, 560 P.2d at 1300. 
In light of the opinions in De Victoria and Mitchell: 
(1) a party must make the requisite showing of substantial 
evidence under HRS § 386-89(c) in order to obtain the relief 
requested, not for the Director or the LIRAB to reopen or review
the case; and (2)

change in or a mistake made in relation to the claimant's 
physical condition). 
Here, in a letter dated July 30, 2010, Porter requested 
that her cases be reopened pursuant to HRS § 386-89(c) because 
"[t]here was obviously a mistake in the determination of fact 
previously which precluded [Porter] from pursuing her claim, 
i.e., that MCS was not a physical condition which was recognized 
as an injury."10 By way of her July 30, 2010 letter, Porter thus 
stated the grounds upon which her application to reopen was based.
11 Therefore, Porter complied with the procedure for an 
application to reopen a workers' compensation case in HAR § 12-10-63 (eff. 1981).

On remand after this court's decision in Porter I, the 
LIRAB issued its August 10, 2016 D&O addressing whether Porter's 
request to reopen satisfied the requirements of HRS § 386-89(c). 
In COL 1, the LIRAB majority generally held that "[Porter] is not
entitled to relief of reopening pursuant to [HRS §] 386-89(c) for
her 2002 claims because she has not presented substantial 
evidence of a change or mistake relating to her physical 
condition."   In COL 1(a), the LIRAB majority concluded: 13 
 
In both [D]e Victoria and Mitchell, the presumption
applied to the work-connectedness of the claimants'
injuries, not the entitlement to reopening or review, whichthe Board does not reach in this case. 
Consistent with the statute and case law, as well as
the ICA's specific instruction in this case, the presumptionof compensability applies to the question of compensabilityonce a case is reopened. There is no presumption thatapplies before a case is reopened or reviewed. 
Therefore, when faced with the issue of whether a
prior determination should be reopened for further review,the foregoing dictates that the threshold question iswhether Claimant met her burden of proof. 
The Board determines that there is no presumption that
Claimant is entitled to reopening, and that Claimant mustprove, by substantial evidence, that there has been a changein or a mistake in a determination of fact related to her physical condition. 
To the extent that the LIRAB majority stated in COL 1 
that Porter was required to put forth substantial evidence of a 
change or mistake relating to her physical condition to justify 
reopening or review under HRS § 386-89(c), we conclude that this
was error because the requisite showing of substantial evidence 
is for the LIRAB to grant the relief requested and not as a  
application for reopening of a case pursuant to section
386-89, HRS, shall be in writing, shall state specifically thegrounds upon which the application is based, and shall beserved upon each party at the time of filing with thedirector. 
(b) Whenever an application for reopening of a case is
made, the director shall review the case file and may, bydiscretion, hear the interested parties. The director shalldeny or grant a reopening and notify the parties in writing. 
13 The LIRAB majority also uses substantially similar language in COL
1(b) and 1(c).

prerequisite to reopen or review the case. See Mitchell, 57 Haw. 
at 546, 560 P.2d at 1299; De Victoria, 56 Haw. at 562, 545 P.2d 
at 699. Despite the misstatements of law, the record14 reflects 
that the LIRAB did in fact reopen and review Porter's case, and that the LIRAB's consideration of whether Porter made the 
requisite showing of substantial evidence under HRS § 386-89(c) 
was actually a determination regarding whether to grant Porter's 
requested relief for her 2002 Claims. Accordingly, the 
misstatements of the law were harmless error. See Survivors of 
Medeiros v. Maui Land & Pineapple Co., 66 Haw. 290, 293, 660 P.2d 1316, 1319 (1983) ("HRS § 91–14(g) of the Administrative 
Procedures Act . . . precludes judicial reversal or modification 
of an administrative decision even where affected by error of law 
. . . unless substantial rights of the petitioner may have been 
prejudiced."). 
As to the applicability of the HRS § 386-85(1) 
presumption to an application for reopening under HRS § 386-
89(c), this case presents circumstances distinguishable from 
those in De Victoria and Mitchell, because the primary issue here 
was whether Porter sustained her claimed injury, not whether her 
claimed injury was related to a work accident. Given these 
circumstances, the presumption under HRS § 386-85(1) does not 
apply and it was proper for the LIRAB majority to consider 
whether Porter made the requisite showing of substantial evidence 
under HRS § 386-89(c) to warrant the granting of relief for her 
2002 Claims. 
14 The August 10, 2016 D&O, specifically FOFs 1-40, which are
unchallenged on appeal, indicate that the LIRAB reopened Porter's case and
reviewed the "entirety of the records on appeal in all of [Porter's] cases onappeal." See Bremer v. Weeks , 104 Hawai #i 43, 63, 85 P.3d 150, 170 (2004)
( 
stating that findings of fact that are not challenged on appeal are binding on
the appellate court). Further, although Porter challenges the LIRAB's evaluationand analyses of the evidence and arguments presented by the parties, theremainder of the August 10, 2016 D&O shows that the LIRAB had in fact reopenedPorter's case and reviewed the submissions of the parties to determine whetherrelief would be granted for Porter's claims under HRS § 386-89(c). 
16 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
B. The LIRAB did not err in denying Porter's request for relief
for her 2002 Claims. 
As discussed 
supra, the LIRAB properly reviewed 
Porter's application under HRS § 386-89(c). The LIRAB reviewed 
and considered the parties' respective memoranda and exhibits 
submitted. Based on the parties' submissions, the LIRAB made 
numerous FOFs in the August 10, 2016 D&O upon which it based its 
denial of Porter's request for relief for her 2002 Claims. On 
appeal, Porter challenges many of these FOFs. 
Porter contends that FOF 50, which stated that "[b]y 
letter dated August 10, 2007, the former Administrator of the 
[DCD] informed [Porter] that MCS was 'NOT recognized as a 
compensable injury for all workers' compensation claims,'" was 
erroneous because it misrepresented the substance of the 
August 10, 2007 letter. Porter points out that FOF 50 quotes 
only a portion of the August 10, 2007 letter, omitting the 
sentence that immediately followed the quoted portion, which 
stated "[w]orkers' compensation determinations are based upon 
whether a claimant suffered a workplace injury/illness, for an 
example, as a result of chemical exposure in the workplace." 
Despite the omission, FOF 50 is an accurate reflection of the 
quoted portion of the August 10, 2007 letter and is not clearly 
erroneous. Pilaa 400, LLC, 132 Hawai# i at 263, 320 P.3d at 928; 
see Waltrip v. TS Enterprises, Inc., 140 Hawai# i 226, 235, 398 
P.3d 815, 824 (2016). 
Porter next contends that the LIRAB erred in its 
finding in FOF 46 that "[t]he November 6, 2006 SSA Notice of 
Award contains no statement or indication of the disabling 
condition underlying Claimant's SSA award." In support of her 
contention, Porter maintains that her SSA Notice of Award 
contained a decision by an administrative law judge, which she 
appended to her Opening Brief, that states, "claimant's multiple 
chemical sensitivity is a 'severe' impairment, based upon the 
requirements in the Regulations. [20 CFR § 404.1520(c)]." Based

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
on our review of the record, it appears that Porter did not 
produce the purported administrative law judge decision in the 
proceedings below and that she had only produced the first page 
of the SSA Notice of Award.15 The first page of the SSA Notice 
of Award does not indicate a recognition of MCS as the basis for Porter's SSA Notice of Award. Further, the appellate courts will 
not consider matters not appearing in the record. State v. 
Moses, 102 Hawai# i 449, 455, 77 P.3d 940, 946 (2003) ("[Appellate 
courts] cannot consider evidence outside the record[.]"). 
Accordingly, this court cannot consider the purported 
administrative law judge decision or the portions of the SSA 
Notice of Award that were appended to Porter's Opening Brief, but 
not contained in the record on appeal. FOF 46 is thus not 
clearly erroneous. Pilaa 400, LLC

at 928; 
see Waltrip, 140 Hawai# i at 235, 398 P.3d at 824. 
Porter challenges FOF 53, which found that the four 
documents, discussed infra, submitted by Porter "appear to have 
been obtained by [Porter] from online sources." Despite her 
assertion of an error, Porter fails to provide any discernable 
argument in support of her challenge, and we thus decline to 
address her contention. See Kakinami v. Kakinami
, 127 Hawai# i

her position that MCS is now a recognized medical diagnosis. 
Porter posits that the LIRAB's decision not to credit the 
documents was erroneous, biased, and collusive, based on the 
LIRAB's criticalness of the credentials of the documents' 
authors, QMC's failure to rebut the credibility of the documents,
and the LIRAB's reliance on the opinions of Dr. Jetser, 
Dr. Morgan, and Dr. Johnson. The August 10, 2016 D&O reflects 
that the LIRAB declined to credit the four documents based on its
finding that there was no reliable or credible evidence that the 
information contained in the documents were credible or that 
their authors were credible, and on the basis that the documents 
did not stand for the proposition that MCS was or is a recognized
medical diagnosis or valid medical disorder. 16

relied on the opinions of Dr. Jetser, Dr. Morgan, and/or

In FOFs 54-56 and 58, the LIRAB found that the document

key components of heart function affected by air pollution, but 
noted that there were several limitations to the data and further 
research should be done; contained no evidence of Bob Weinhold's

not propose that MCS was, is, or has become an accepted medical

were credited, it does not stand for the proposition that MCS

states "[e]pidemiological studies have demonstrated a consistent 
increased risk for cardiovascular events in relation to both 
short- and long-term exposure to present-day concentrations of 
ambient particulate matter"; while the suffix attached to each 
author's name indicates his or her educational degree, there is 
no evidence of their training, skill, experience or other

professionals and regulatory agencies with a comprehensive review 
of the literature on air pollution and cardiovascular disease, 
addressing implications of such findings in relation to public 
health and regulatory policies, and providing practical 
recommendations and suggestions for future research; the document

erroneous. However, we observe that the document submitted was 
incomplete only so far as it appears to be an abstract of the 
actual document named in the title. Further, contrary to the 
LIRAB's finding in FOF 60, the document did indicate "other 
credentials" of the authors, as the title intimates that the 
authors are members of the Expert Panel on Population and

the preceding, we conclude that the portion of FOF 60 that found 
that "there is no evidence of [the authors'] . . . other 
credentials," is not supported by substantial evidence in the 
record and is clearly erroneous. Pilaa 400, LLC, 132 Hawai# i at

However, we conclude that this error is harmless and did 
not prejudice Porter's substantial rights in light of our

determination that the other FOFs pertaining to the document were 
not clearly erroneous. 
For the reasons discussed infra, we 
decline to disturb the LIRAB's decision not to credit this 
document in FOF 64. See Survivors of Medeiros, 66 Haw. at 293, 
660 P.2d at 1319. 
The two other documents presented by Porter are 
"Research Shows Toxic Chemicals Initiate Multiple Chemical Sensitivity" by Susie Collins dated July 18, 2009, and 
"Breakthrough Study on Multiple Chemical Sensitivity Shows MCS is 
an Epidemic Caused by Toxic Chemicals; Peer-Reviewed Paper is 
Published in Prestigious Toxicology Reference Work." Both 
documents appear to be reports on versions of a paper by 
Dr. Martin L. Pall entitled "Multiple Chemical Sensitivity: 
Toxicological and Sensitivity Mechanisms," which were to be 
published in or around 2009 and documented his research on MCS. 
In FOFs 66-69 and 71-72, relating to the document by Susie 
Collins dated July 18, 2009, the LIRAB found: the document 
provides comments on a paper by Martin Pall, Ph.D, but Dr. Pall's 
actual paper was not presented as evidence; there is no evidence 
of Susie Collins' education, training, skill, experience or other 
credentials; the document does not propose that MCS was, is, or 
has become an accepted medical diagnosis or valid medical 
disorder; the reliability of the information contained within the 
document cannot be determined; and even if the document were 
credited, it does not stand for the proposition that MCS was, is, 
or has become an accepted medical diagnosis or valid medical 
disorder, but rather, is only a suggestion by one person that the 
medical community should consider accepting MCS as a valid 
physiological diagnosis. In FOFs 73-76 and 78-79, relating to 
the document titled "Breakthrough Study on Multiple Chemical 
Sensitivity Shows MCS is an Epidemic Caused by Toxic Chemicals; 
Peer-Reviewed Paper is Published in Prestigious Toxicology 
Reference Work," the LIRAB found: the document does not identify 
an author, publisher/publication, or date; the document does not 
22 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
propose that MCS was, is, or has become an accepted medical 
diagnosis or valid medical disorder, but rather, that it should 
be considered a valid physiological diagnosis; the reliability of 
the information contained within the document cannot be 
determined; and even if the document were credited, it does not 
stand for the proposition that MCS was, is, or has become an 
accepted medical diagnosis or valid medical disorder, but rather, 
is only a suggestion that the medical community should consider 
accepting MCS as a valid physiological diagnosis. 
Although the 
former document submitted by Porter contains an abstract purportedly taken from Dr. Pall's paper and the latter document 
purports to summarize the points made in Dr. Pall's paper, the 
actual paper does not appear in the record and the 
reliability/credibility of the publishers or author(s) is not 
established in the documents themselves or by other evidence in 
the record. Therefore, there is substantial evidence in the 
record that supports FOFs 69 and 76, that the LIRAB could not 
confirm the reliability of the documents' contents, and we are 
not left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has 
been made. Waltrip, 140 Hawai# i at 235, 398 P.3d at 824. Based 
on our review of the documents contained in the record, we also conclude that FOFs 66-68, 71-75, and 78-79 are sufficiently 
supported by the record. Pilaa 400, LLC, 132 Hawai# i at 263, 320 
P.3d at 928; see Waltrip, 140 Hawai# i at 235, 398 P.3d at 824. 
In FOF 80, the LIRAB found that "[t]here is no reliable 
or credible evidence that the foregoing documents were peer-reviewed or published in a peer-reviewed medical or scientific 
journal." Notwithstanding "The Heart of Toxicity: Details of 
Cardiovascular Damage Uncovered," by Bob Weinhold, stating that 
it was published in Environmental Health Perspectives on April 1, 
2005; and "A Statement for Healthcare Professionals From the 
Expert Panel on Population and Prevention Science of the American 
Heart Association," by Robert D. Brook, M.D., et al., appearing 
to be an abstract for a statement published as an "AHA Scientific

Statement" by the American Heart Association's Expert Panel on 
Population and Prevention Science; neither the documents 
themselves nor other evidence in the record indicate that the 
documents were peer-reviewed or that the publications they were 
published in are peer-reviewed medical or scientific journals. 
FOF 80 is therefore supported by substantial evidence in the 
record and is not clearly erroneous. Pilaa 400, LLC, 132 Hawai# i 
at 263, 320 P.3d at 928; see Waltrip, 140 Hawai# i at 235, 398 
P.3d at 824. 
Based on our review of the four documents, as contained 
in the record, we find that FOFs 54-56, 58-63,17 65-69, 71-76, 
and 78-80 are sufficiently supported by the record and we are not left with a definite and firm conviction that mistakes have been 
made. Pilaa 400, LLC, 132 Hawai# i at 263, 320 P.3d at 928; See 
Waltrip, 140 Hawai# i at 235, 398 P.3d at 824. Insofar as FOFs 
54-56, 58-63, 65-69, 71-76, and 78-80 are not clearly erroneous 
and it is within the LIRAB's province to determine credibility 
and what weight, if any, to assign the evidence, we decline to 
disturb the LIRAB's decisions not to credit the four documents in 
FOFs 57, 64, 70, and 77. See Igawa, 97 Hawai# i at 410, 38 P.3d 
at 578; De Victoria, 56 Haw. at 559, 545 P.2d at 698. 
Porter advocates that the LIRAB erred in FOF 41 by 
finding that she had not alleged that her physical condition changed since the LIRAB denied her 2002 Claims for MCS or 
idiopathic environmental intolerance injuries in its July 19, 
2005 D&O.
18 Porter only supports her argument by asserting that 
17 Excepting the portion of FOF 60 that found that the document did not
indicate the authors' "other credentials," which we determined to be clearly
erroneous. 
18 The July 19, 2005 D&O denied Porter's 2002 Claims on the basis that
LIRAB did not recognize MCS as a personal injury, as the "opinions of Dr. Morgan,Dr. Jetser, and Dr. Johnson affirm that . . . MCS is still not recognized as anorganic illness or disease in the medical community, and that the diagnosis ofMCS remains controversial and cannot be proven or confirmed with scientificbasis." Moreover, the LIRAB found that Dr. Ewing acknowledged that MCS is"unverified by science and remains controversial and not recognized as an illnessor disease in the medical community[.]" 
24 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the LIRAB failed to take into account an April 24, 2006 letter by 
Dr. Ewing stating, in pertinent part, that Porter "has become 
progressively more chemically sensitive since last seen on 
February 9, 2006. . . . It is my professional opinion that she is 
permanently and chronically disabled because of her chemical 
sensitivity . . . ." 
Despite Porter's presentation of 
Dr. Ewing's April 24, 2006 letter, which reports a worsening of her chemical sensitivity symptoms and is dated subsequent to the 
LIRAB's July 19, 2005 Decision and Order, the record indicates 
that Porter continues to assert the same alleged injury of MCS or 
idiopathic environmental intolerance that was addressed in the 
July 19, 2005 D&O denying her 2002 Claims. Further, Dr. Ewing's 
letter does not propose that Porter's diagnosis has changed from 
MCS. Since Porter's 2002 Claims were originally denied on the 
basis of the LIRAB finding that MCS was not a recognized 
compensable personal injury and Porter does not claim that her 
condition has changed from MCS, Porter's allegation of a change 
in condition that would warrant the granting of relief for her 
2002 Claims is without merit. Cf. 13 Larson's Workers' 
Compensation Law § 131.03(2)(a) (2019) ("Change-of-condition reopening proceeding, the issue before the Board is sharply 
restricted to the question of extent of improvement or worsening 
of the injury on which the original award was based. If the 
original award held that there was no connection between the 
accident and claimant's permanent disability, there is nothing to 
reopen, and claimant cannot retry the issue of work-connection 
through the device of a reopening petition. . . . [N]o matter who 
brings the reopening proceeding, neither party can raise original 
issues such as . . . occurrence of a compensable accident, and 
degree of disability at the time of the first award."). As a 
result, it was not clearly erroneous for the LIRAB to find that 
Porter had not alleged that there has been any change in her 
physical condition since the July 19, 2005 D&O that would warrant 
the granting of relief for her 2002 Claims. Pilaa 400, LLC, 132

Based on its various FOFs pertaining to the various 
documents and exhibits submitted by the parties, the LIRAB 
concluded in FOF 85 and COL 1(b) and (c) that Porter was not 
entitled to relief for her 2002 Claims because there was not 
substantial evidence of a change or mistake relating to her 
physical condition. Porter challenges FOF 85 and COL 1 on 
appeal. 
In challenging FOF 85 and COL 1(b), Porter alleges that 
the LIRAB erred because she had provided substantial evidence of 
a change19 relating to her physical condition on the bases that: 
(1) Dr. Ewing provided his opinion in a letter dated June 17, 2005, that Porter suffers from symptoms due to exposure to 
chemicals; (2) she has provided post-2005 scientific and peer 
reviewed publications supporting her position that MCS is a 
medical disorder; (3)
 the SSA Notice of Award deemed Porter 
disabled with MCS; and (4) the September 6, 2006 letter from the former Administrator of the Disability Compensation Division
20 
appears to indicate that MCS may be compensable. The June 17, 
19 Insofar as Porter argues that her submission of the four documents,
the SSA Notice of Award, and the September 6, 2006 letter from the former
Administrator of the Disability Compensation Division, supports her contentionthat MCS is a recognized medical diagnosis, we conclude that this does not amountto an argument of a change in a determination of fact related to the physical
condition of the injured employee. Rather, it is an argument of a mistake in a 
determination of fact related to Porter's physical condition. 3 Modern Workers Compensation § 309:11 ("Developments in medical science warrant reopening anaward on the basis of a mistake of fact."). 
20 The September 6, 2016 letter expressed that DLIR's database could
not identify cases involving MCS and that DLIR was unaware of other states thatrecognized MCS in their workers' compensation statutes. Further, the letter stated that: 
Any employee may file a [workers' compensation] claim for MCS.If the MCS is determined to be caused by work, the injurywould be covered under [workers' compensation], however if MCSis determined not to have been caused by work, the claim wouldbe denied. Automatically covering all MCS claims under[workers' compensation] may have the unintended effect ofrequiring [workers' compensation] to cover MCS cases notnecessarily caused by work.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2005 letter from Dr. Ewing to Frank A. Ury states, inter alia, 
that "[t]here is no question that when [Porter] is exposed to any 
type of volatile chemicals, she definitely has a physical 
problem, has respiratory problems, gets fatigued, and does not 
have a neurological problem." This appears to describe the same 
or substantially similar symptoms as considered in the July 19, 
2005 D&O21 denying Porter's 2002 Claims. Based on the foregoing 
and our determination that Porter's arguments of a change in a determination of fact related to her physical condition are 
actually arguments of a mistake, the LIRAB did not err in finding 
and concluding that the evidence relied upon by Porter does not 
constitute substantial evidence of a change in her physical 
condition entitling her to relief for her 2002 Claims under HRS § 
386-89(c). Pilaa 400, LLC, 132 Hawai# i at 263, 320 P.3d at 928; 
see Waltrip, 140 Hawai# i at 235, 398 P.3d at 824. 
Porter argues that the LIRAB erred in COL 1(c), as 
there is substantial evidence of a mistake in the LIRAB's decision to affirm the DCD's decision to deem her 2002 Claims 
non-compensable because the LIRAB denied Porter's 2002 Claims 
based on its lay opinion that MCS was not a valid medical 
diagnosis, while Porter presented Dr. Ewing's diagnosis of her 
MCS condition and her medical records, which objectively show 
that the treating physicians opined that Porter's MCS related 
symptoms were due to her workplace environment. 
FOFs 3-6, which are unchallenged and thus binding on 
this appeal, Kelly v. 1250 Oceanside Partners, 111 Hawai# i 205, 
227, 140 P.3d 985, 1007 (2006), state that, on July 19, 2005, the LIRAB affirmed the DCD's March 19, 2004 Decision to deny Porter's 
2002 Claims "[b]ased on the medical opinions presented, [. . .] 
that the diagnosis of MCS remained controversial and could not be 
proven or confirmed with scientific basis." Further, based on 
21 The record indicates that the hearing for the July 19, 2005 Decision
and Order occurred on June 16, 2005, one day prior to the June 17, 2005 letter
being transmitted. 
27  
            
              
            
            
     
            
              
            
              
         FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
our review of the July 19, 2005 D&O, the LIRAB denied Porter's 
2002 Claims on the basis that the LIRAB did not recognize MCS as 
a personal injury because the "opinions of Dr. Morgan, 
Dr. Jetser, and Dr. Johnson affirm that . . . MCS is still not 
recognized as an organic illness or disease in the medical 
community, and that the diagnosis of MCS remains controversial 
and cannot be proven or confirmed with scientific basis." 
Therefore, contrary to Porter's assertion, it does not appear 
that the LIRAB relied on their own lay opinions in affirming the 
denial of Porter's 2002 Claims. Additionally, insofar as Porter 
is asserting that it was a mistake for the LIRAB to weigh the 
opinions of Dr. Morgan, Dr. Jetser, and Dr. Johnson in its 
July 19, 2005 D&O more favorably than the opposing diagnosis 
provided by Dr. Ewing,22 and Porter's medical records,23 we 
decline to address that contention without a discernable argument in support of it, see Kakinami, 127 Hawai# i at 144 n.16, 276 P.3d 
at 713 n.16, and decline to consider the weight of the evidence or to pass upon the LIRAB's determinations as to credibility of 
the witnesses or conflicts in testimony. See Igawa, 97 Hawai# i 
at 410, 38 P.3d at 578; De Victoria, 56 Haw. at 559, 545 P.2d at 698. 
Based on the record in this case, it was not wrong for 
the LIRAB to conclude that Porter had not carried her burden of 
showing by substantial evidence that a mistake had been made in 
the determination of her 2002 Claims. Pilaa 400, LLC, 132 
Hawai# i at 263, 320 P.3d at 928. The LIRAB, therefore, did not 
err in denying Porter's request for relief for her 2002 Claims. 
22 Porter refers to this document as "Exhibit T" in her Opening Brief.
However, there is no Exhibit "T" contained in Porter's Opening Brief. As best as 
can be determined, it appears that Porter is referring to "Dr. Ewing's initialassessment" dated August 26, 2003, which is attached as Exhibit T in Porter'sPost-Trial Memorandum dated September 15, 2015. 
23 Porter refers to this document as "Exhibit H" in her Opening Brief.
However, there is no Exhibit "H" contained in Porter's Opening Brief. As best as can be determined, it appears that Porter is referring to "ER records includingX-ray and EKG reports" with various dates in 2002 and 2003, which is attached asExhibit H in Porter's Post-Trial Memorandum dated September 15, 2015. 
28 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
We note, however, that this case does not decide whether MCS is, 
in fact, a recognized injury. 
Rather, the question here was 
whether Porter made the requisite showing of substantial evidence required by HRS § 386-89(c) to obtain the relief sought. 
C. The LIRAB did not err in declining to address Porter's 2003
Claim and fraud claims as Porter waived those claims in the prior appeal and the issues were outside the scope ofremand. 
As to COL 3, Porter contends that the LIRAB erred by 
concluding that its previous denial of Porter's contentions of 
fraud was the law of the case and thereby declining to re-address 
her fraud allegations. COL 3 misstates that Porter's allegations 
of fraud have been affirmed, but nonetheless comes to the right 
conclusion. 
The record shows that the LIRAB denied Porter's fraud 
allegations in its September 17, 2013 D&O and in its December 3, 
2013 D&O, which Porter appealed to the ICA on December 23, 2013, 
along with the December 3, 2013 Order that denied Porter's Motion 
for Reconsideration of the September 17, 2013 D&O. However, in 
appealing the foregoing to this court, Porter failed to include a 
fraud argument in her Opening Brief and we deemed that point of 
error waived pursuant to HRAP Rule 28(b)(7). Porter I, 2015 WL 
1400787, at *7 & n.9. Accordingly, this court affirmed the LIRAB’s December 3, 2013 D&O to the extent that it affirmed the 
DCD's denial of Porter's allegations of fraud pertaining to the 
October 1, 2010 letter. Id. at *8. We also vacated the LIRAB's 
September 17, 2013 D&O and December 3, 2013 Order, to the extent that they pertained to requests to reopen claims under HRS § 386-
89(c), and remanded the issue to the LIRAB for further 
proceedings. Id. The September 17, 2013 D&O and December 3, 
2013 Order were affirmed in all other respects, including the LIRAB's affirmation of the DCD's decision to deny Porter's 
allegations of fraud relating to incidences alleged to have 
occurred before March 24, 2009. See id. 
29 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Being that we previously deemed Porter to have waived 
her fraud arguments in a prior appeal in this same action, and no 
cogent reason for modifying that determination is apparent, 
Porter may not reopen the issue at this later stage of 
litigation. See Hussey v. Say, 139 Hawai# i 181, 185, 384 P.3d 
1282, 1286 (2016) ("The law of the case doctrine holds that 'a determination of a question of law made by an appellate court in 
the course of an action becomes the law of the case and may not 
be disputed by a reopening of the question at a later stage of 
the litigation.'" (citation omitted)); Wong v. City & Cnty. of 
Honolulu
, 66 Haw. 389, 396, 665 P.2d 157, 162 (1983) ("Unless 
cogent reasons support the second court's action, any modification of a prior ruling of another court of equal and 
concurrent jurisdiction will be deemed an abuse of discretion." 
(emphasis omitted)). This court thus declines to address 
Porter's re-assertion of the fraud allegations. Further, because 
the scope of remand was specifically limited to the issue of 
reopening Porter's claims under HRS § 386-89(c) in the 
September 17, 2013 D&O and December 3, 2013 Order, the LIRAB did 
not err by declining to re-address Porter's fraud allegations 
because doing so would have exceeded the scope of remand. See 
Chun v. Bd. of Trs. of Emps.' Ret. Sys. of State of Hawai# i, 106 
Hawai# i 416, 439, 106 P.3d 339, 362 (2005) (observing "(1) that 
[i]t is the duty of the trial court, on remand, to comply strictly with the mandate of the appellate court according to its 
true intent and meaning, as determined by the directions given by 
the reviewing court, and (2) that when acting under an appellate 
court's mandate, an inferior court cannot vary it, or examine it 
for any other purpose than execution; or give any other or 
further relief; . . . or intermeddle with it, further than to 
settle so much as has been remanded" (internal quotation marks 
and citations omitted)). 
We similarly decline to address Porter's contention 
regarding her 2003 Claim. In COL 2, the LIRAB concluded that the 
30    
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"claim relating to [Porter's] May 13, 2003 alleged work injury is
time-barred" and that the LIRAB "lacks subject matter 
jurisdiction over the alleged May 13, 2003 work injury." COL 2 
is based on the LIRAB's findings that the March 10, 2011 DCD 
Decision concluded that Porter's 2003 Claim was time-barred 
pursuant to the five-year statute of limitation of HRS § 386-82 
(1993)  and that, since Porter had not appealed the DCD's 
decision, the LIRAB lacked jurisdiction over the issue. 24 
In Porter's previous appeal to this court, we noted: 
As best as can be determined, Porter relied on HRS
§ 386–89(b) (1993) to support reopening her 2003 injuryclaim. HRS § 386–89(b) provides, in relevant part, that"[t]he director may at any time, either of the director'sown motion or upon the application of any party, reopen anycase on the ground that fraud has been practiced on thedirector or on any party and render such decision as isproper under the circumstances." 
Porter I, 2015 WL 1400787, at *2 n.5. Thereafter, we concluded 
that Porter waived her fraud arguments, upon which her request to
reopen her 2003 Claim was based, and thus limited our analysis of  
24 HRS § 386-82 provides: 
§386-82  Cla im  for  compensation;  limitation  of  time.   The
right  to  compensation  under  this  chapter  shall  be  barred
unless  a  written  claim  therefor  is  made  to  the  director  of

the  date  at  which  the  effects  of  the  injury  for  which  the
employee  is  entitled  to  compensation  have  become  manifest;  and
(2)  within  five  years  after  the  date  of  the  accident  or
occurrence  which  caused  the  injury.  
The  foregoing  li mitations  of  time  shall  not  apply  to  a

or  other  mineral  or  substance  with  carcinogenic  properties,  as

radiation,  or  radioactive  substances,  but  such  claim  shall  be

89(c). Porter I, 2015 WL 1400787, at *7 n.9, *8. Accordingly, 
we decline to address Porter's contention regarding her 2003

V. Conclusion
 The LIRAB properly considered whether Porter made the 
requisite showing of substantial evidence under HRS § 386-89(c) 
to warrant the granting of relief for her 2002 Claims and did not 
err in denying Porter's request for relief. To the extent that

the LIRAB did not err in declining to address those claims on
