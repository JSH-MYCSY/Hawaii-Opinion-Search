GLENN JENKS,
Claimant-Appellant/Appellee,
v.
 
PACIFIC OHANA HOSTEL CORPORATION,
Employer-Appellee/Appellant,
and
 
HAWAII EMPLOYERS' MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY,
Insurance Carrier-Appellee/Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEAL BOARD
 
(CASE NO. AB 2015-075; DCD NO. 2-14-03659)

 
ORDER DISMISSING THE APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Upon review of record, it appears that we lack
 
jurisdiction over this appeal that Employer-Appellee/Appellant
 
Pacific Ohana Hostel Corporation and Insurance Carrier­Appellee/Appellant Hawaii Employers' Mutual Insurance Company
 have asserted from the Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals
 Board's (LIRAB's) August 4, 2016 Decision and Order because the
 
Decision and Order is not independently appealable.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 386-88
 
(Repl. 2015) and 91-14(a) (Repl. 2012), an aggrieved party may
 
appeal a final decision and order by the LIRAB directly to the
 Intermediate Court of Appeals:
 
The appeal of a decision or order of the LIRAB is
governed by HRS § 91-14(a), the statute authorizing appeals
in administrative agency cases. HRS § 91-14(a) authorizes
judicial review of a final decision and order in a contested
case or a preliminary ruling of the nature that deferral of
review pending entry of a subsequent final decision would
deprive appellant of adequate relief. For purposes of HRS §
91-14(a), we have defined "final order" to mean an order
ending the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be
accomplished. Consequently, an order is not final if the
rights of a party involved remain undetermined or if the
matter is retained for further action.
 
Bocalbos v. Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children, 89 
Hawai'i 436, 439, 974 P.2d 1026, 1029 (1999) (citations and some 
internal quotation marks omitted). The August 4, 2016 Decision and Order did not end the proceedings before the LIRAB and leave nothing further to be accomplished. According to the record on appeal, the LIRAB has yet to enter a final order that finally adjudicates the substantive issues in Claimant-Appellant/Appellee Glenn Jenks's administrative appeal in case number AB 2015-074, which is still pending before the LIRAB. Therefore, the Decision and Order is not an appealable, final order under HRS §§ 386-88 and 91-14(a). 
Although exceptions to the final order requirement
 
exist under the doctrine enunciated in Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S.
 201 (1848) (the Forgay doctrine) and the collateral order
 doctrine, the Decision and Order does not satisfy the
 requirements for appealability under either doctrine. See Ciesla
 
v. Reddish, 78 Hawai
'i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) 
(regarding the two requirements for appealability under the 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 
Hawai'i 319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding the three 
requirements for appealability under the collateral order doctrine). Absent an appealable, final decision and order by the LIRAB, we lack jurisdiction over this appeal. 
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
 
case number CAAP-16-0000608 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
