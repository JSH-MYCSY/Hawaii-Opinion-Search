STATE OF HAWAI#I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
GARY LEE FELICIANO, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
(CR. NO. 14-1-0660(4))
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Fujise, Presiding Judge, Chan and Wadsworth, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Gary Lee Feliciano (Feliciano)
appeals from the August 17, 2016 Judgment, Conviction and
Sentence entered by the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit
(Circuit Court).   After a jury trial, the Circuit Court
convicted Feliciano of Assault in the First Degree (Assault One)
in violation of Hawai#i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707-710(1)
(2014).   Feliciano was sentenced to ten years incarceration with
credit for time served.21
On appeal, Feliciano argues the Circuit Court erred
because: (1) there was insufficient evidence to prove Assault
One; (2) it was improper to admit the complaining witness's (CW)
redacted grand jury testimony as evidence; (3)  it was improper to
admit prior bad acts evidence to prove intent and the acts were

2HRS § 707-710(1) provides:  "A person commits the offense of
assault in the first degree if the person intentionally or knowingly causes
serious bodily injury to another person."  Serious bodily injury is "bodily
injury which creates a substantial risk of death or which causes serious,
permanent disfigurement, or protracted loss or impairment of the function of
any bodily member or organ."  HRS § 707-700 (2014).NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
remote in time; and  (4) it was improper to admit the temporary
restraining order (TRO) petition as extrinsic evidence of bad
acts without proper Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 404(b)
evaluation and HRE Rule 403 balancing.3
After a careful review of the record on appeal and the
relevant legal authorities, and giving due consideration to the
issues raised and the arguments advanced by the parties, we
resolve Feliciano's points on appeal as follows and affirm.
1.There was substantial evidence of serious bodily
injury.  We review the sufficiency of evidence on appeal as
follows:
[E]vidence adduced in the trial court must be considered in
the strongest light for the prosecution when the appellate
court passes on the legal sufficiency of such evidence to
support a conviction; the same standard applies whether the
case was before a judge or jury.  The test on appeal is not
whether guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt, but
whether there was substantial evidence to support the
conclusion of the trier of fact.
State v. Richie, 88 Hawai#i 19, 33, 960 P.2d 1227, 1241 (1998)
(quoting State v. Quitog, 85 Hawai# i 128, 145, 938 P.2d 559, 576
(1997)).  "'Substantial evidence' as to every material element of
the offense charged is credible evidence which is of sufficient
quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable
caution to support a conclusion."  Richie, 88 Hawai#i at 33, 960
P.2d at 1241 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).
Feliciano challenges the sufficiency of the evidence only with
regard to the proof of serious bodily injury, arguing that the
prosecution failed to prove the injury involved created a
substantial risk of death.
We need look no further than the testimony of
Dr. William Langston (Dr. Langston), who testified that CW
presented as bleeding from the chest and was an "unstable
patient," her blood oxygen level was low, she was in "respiratory
distress[,]" and in the "critical part of the curve where she
could decompensate[ ] quickly[.]"  Dr. Langston stated that CW4

4Decompensation is defined as "inability of the heart to maintain
adequate circulation[.]"  Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 323 (11th
ed. 2003).

could continue to deteriorate, which would result in death.  With
significant intervention, including gaining control of her
airways and placing a central line for blood transfusion, CW's
heart rate came down and her blood pressure went up.  CW was
thereafter held in the hospital for two or three days.  Taking
the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,
there was sufficient evidence proving CW suffered a serious
bodily injury.
2.The Circuit Court did not err by admitting CW's
grand jury testimony as substantive evidence at trial.  HRE
Rule 613(b) (2016) provides:
Extrinsic evidence of prior inconsistent statement of
witness.  Extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent
statement by a witness is not admissible unless, on
direct or cross-examination, (1) the circumstances of
the statement have been brought to the attention of
the witness, and (2) the witness has been asked
whether the witness made the statement.
With regard to this provision, the commentary provides
that it should be read in conjunction with HRE Rules 607 and
802.1(1).  HRE Rule 607 (2016) provides that the credibility of a
witness may be attacked by any party.  HRE Rule 802.1 (2016)
provides that previous statements made by witnesses who testify
at trial are not excluded if "[t]he declarant is subject to
cross-examination concerning the subject matter of the
declarant's statement, the statement is inconsistent with the
declarant's testimony, the statement is offered in compliance
with rule 613(b), and the statement was . . . [g]iven under oath
subject to the penalty of perjury at a trial, hearing, or other
proceeding, or in a deposition[.]"  Moreover, prior inconsistent
statements, if in compliance with HRE Rules 613(b) and
802.1(1)(B), are admissible for substantive purposes.  State v.
Eastman, 81 Hawai# i 131, 135-36, 913 P.2d 57, 61-62 (1996); see
also State v. Sanchez, 82 Hawai#i 517, 523 n.2, 923 P.2d 934, 940
n.2 (App. 1996) (grand jury transcripts were admissible for
substantive purposes under HRE Rule 802.1(1)(A)).
CW's grand jury testimony was clearly inconsistent with
her trial testimony as, at a minimum, she testified at trial that
she pinned Feliciano to the couch and pressed her forearm against
his throat, the basis of Feliciano's assertion of self-defense,
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
while in her grand jury testimony she declared Feliciano stormed
into the shed, grabbed her, pushed her on to the couch, accused
her of adultery, and when she struggled away, stabbed her.  The
State questioned CW about giving testimony to the grand jury,
which she remembered.  When the State asked CW about answers she
had previously given to the grand jury, she agreed with some
answers and denied having given others.  Finally, Feliciano was
given the opportunity, and did, albeit briefly, cross-examine CW
about her grand jury testimony.
Thus, CW's grand jury testimony was properly admitted
as extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement pursuant
to HRE Rules 613(b) and 802.1(1)(A).  See Sanchez, 82 Hawai#i at
523 n.2, 923 P.2d at 940 n.2. 
3.Feliciano claims the Circuit Court erred by
admitting police reports and TRO petitions spanning twelve years
prior to the charged conduct because they were too remote in time
to be relevant to the issue of intent.
"'Relevant evidence' means evidence having any tendency
to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the
determination of the action more probable or less probable than
it would be without the evidence."  HRE Rule 401.  HRE Rule 404
prohibits evidence of a person's character or a trait of a
person's character for the purpose of proving action in
conformity therewith on a particular occasion, but permits the
use of evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts "where such
evidence is probative of another fact that is of consequence to
the determination of the action, such as proof of motive,
opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity,
modus operandi, or absence of mistake or accident."  The list of
permissible purposes in Rule 404(b) is not intended to be
exhaustive "for the range of relevancy outside the ban is almost
infinite."  State v. Clark, 83 Hawai#i 289, 300, 926 P.2d 194,
205 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting E.W.
Cleary, McCormick on Evidence § 190, at 448 (Cleary ed. 1972)). 
Instead, 404(b) defines one impermissible purpose.  Id. at 301,
926 P.2d at 206 (citing United States v. Miller, 895 F.2d 1431
(D.C. Cir. 1990).  HRE Rule 403 provides for the exclusion of
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
relevant evidence where "its probative value is substantially
outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the
issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue
delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative
evidence."  On appeal, we review the trial court's relevance
determination de novo.  State v. Richie, 88 Hawai#i at 36-37, 960
P.2d at 1244-45 (1998).
Where a victim recants allegations of abuse, evidence
of prior incidents of violence between the victim and the
defendant are relevant to show the trier of fact the context of
the relationship between the victim and the defendant, where, as
here, that relationship is offered as a possible explanation for
the victim's recantation.  Clark, 83 Hawai# i at 301-02, 926 P.2d
at 206-07 (discussing State v. Thompson, 520 N.W.2d 468 (Minn.
Ct. App. 1994) (prior threats admitted where victim recanted
allegation of sexual assault against boyfriend); Smith v. State,
669 A.2d 1 (Del. 1995) (evidence of other incidents of violence
admitted in domestic sexual assault case)).  Here, the court
deemed the material relevant only after CW recanted her
allegations against Feliciano.  Therefore, because CW recanted,
evidence of prior instances of violence were relevant to show the
context of their relationship in order to offer an explanation
for CW's recantation.
HRE Rule 403 balancing is reviewed for an abuse of
discretion.  Richie, 88 Hawai#i at 37, 960 P.2d at 1245.  In
weighing the probative value of the evidence against the possible
prejudicial effect, we consider
the strength of the evidence as to the commission of
the other crime, the similarities between the crimes,
the interval of time that has elapsed between the
crimes, the need for the evidence, the efficacy of
alternative proof, and the degree to which the
evidence probably will rouse the jury to overmastering
hostility.
State v. Behrendt, 124 Hawai# i 90, 106, 237 P.3d 1156, 1172
(2010) (citation omitted).
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
First, the strength of the evidence as to the prior
incidents was high.  All were documented with police reports or
TRO petitions.  Thus, the evidence was strong because it was
supported by contemporaneous police reports or sworn TRO
petitions.
Second, the similarity between the prior incidents and
the present offense was high and showed escalating severity.  Ten
of the prior incidents involved physical violence, nine included
allegations of abuse by Feliciano upon CW, and two included
allegations of self-inflicted wounds that Feliciano attempted to
blame on CW.  Further, CW allowed two of the TRO petitions to
dissolve previously and the argument on the instant occasion was
over still another TRO that CW refused to withdraw.   The other
three items related to verbal abuse by Feliciano against CW. 
Therefore, the similarity was high because it involved the same
parties and similar conduct.
Third, the interval of time that elapsed between the
crimes did not diminish the probative value of the context of the
relationship.  The documented allegations took place over a
period of twelve years from 2002 until the instant August 2014
stabbing.  Where there is "high relevance and strong need, the
rule 403 balance will always favor admissibility."  Behrendt, 124
Hawai#i at 106, 237 P.3d at 1172 (internal quotation marks
omitted) (quoting Addison M. Bowman, Hawaii Rules of Evidence
Manual § 404-3[2][B] (2008-2009 ed.)).  In Clark, the court
deemed the context of the couples' relationship "a central fact
of consequence[,]" and thus highly probative of the victim's
recantation.  Id. at 303, 926 P.2d at 208.  Further, in State v.
Asuncion, we affirmed admitting police reports of domestic
violence going back six years against the defendant.  110 Hawai# i
154, 166-67, 129 P.3d 1182, 1194-95 (App. 2006) (citing Clark, 83
Hawai#i at 303, 926 P.2d at 208).  Here, given CW and Feliciano's
twenty-six-year relationship, events over the prior twelve years
are not too remote in time and remain probative of the context of
their relationship.
6NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Fourth, the need for the evidence was high.  Clark
emphasized that where the complainant recants, the need for the
evidence is high because the context of the relationship is "a
central fact of consequence[.]"  Clark, 83 Hawai# i at 303, 926
P.2d at 208.  Thus, the need for the evidence was high because of
CW's recantation. 
Fifth, the efficacy of alternative proof was low.  The
only alternative proof offered was Daughter's testimony about the
August 16, 2014 incident (Item 14).  Daughter's brief testimony
was of non-specific arguing between her parents, that the police
were possibly called "because they always get involved[,]" and
only after Daughter's recollection was refreshed and she was
subjected to leading questioning did she acknowledge that
Feliciano had hurt himself in an attempt to make CW look guilty. 
Therefore, alternative proof was not particularly effective. 
Sixth, the degree to which the evidence would rouse the
jury to overmastering hostility was low.  The evidence of past
incidents was highly similar, involved the same parties, and
described events that were less violent and was thus unlikely to
rouse the jury to overmastering hostility.  See Behrendt, 124
Hawai#i at 107, 237 P.3d at 1173 (prior acts of the same general
type of conduct and same complaining witness unlikely to
prejudice a jury).
On review, having independently determined the evidence
in question was relevant and that there was ample basis to
conclude the prejudicial effect was outweighed by the probative
value of the evidence, the Circuit Court did not abuse its
discretion in admitting Items 1-4 and 6-14.
4.  Feliciano asserts the court erred in admitting the
substance of the August 18, 2014 Ex Parte Petition for an HRS 586
Temporary Restraining Order in FC-DA 14-1-0493 (TRO Petition)5
5Feliciano incorrectly refers to this document as "Item 15" from
the hearing on the State's renewed motion to admit HRE Rule 404(b) evidence.
At this hearing, the State identified the TRO as "Number 15" listed in its
Notice of Intent to Use 404(b) Information (Notice).  Item 15 of the Notice
reads,   
All the facts and circumstances contained within FC DA 14-1-
0493, documenting abuse by Defendant upon [CW] and the
(continued...)

because it failed to conduct a proper HRE Rule 404(b) evaluation
or an HRE Rule 403 balancing.  HRE Rule 403 balancing is reviewed
for an abuse of discretion.  Richie, 88 Hawai#i at 37, 960 P.2d
at 1245.  In weighing the probative value of the evidence against
the possible unfairly prejudicial effect, we consider 
the strength of the evidence as to the commission of
the other crime, the similarities between the crimes,
the interval of time that has elapsed between the
crimes, the need for the evidence, the efficacy of
alternative proof, and the degree to which the
evidence probably will rouse the jury to overmastering
hostility.
Behrendt, 124 Hawai#i at 106, 237 P.3d at 1172 (citation
omitted).
At the pre-trial hearing on the State's Motion to Admit
404(b) Evidence, the Circuit Court reserved ruling on items 10
through 15 because 
the Court is not ready to rule that the probative value
outweighs the prejudicial value at this time. 
Obviously the parties can renew their --  either their
motion to allow it in or their objection for it to come in. 
But at this time, that's the Court's rulings on this  -- on
these items.
At trial, the Circuit Court and the parties engaged in a lengthy
discussion regarding the probative value of the various items
proffered by the State as well as their prejudicial impact,
including whether the evidence would be introduced in the State's
case-in-chief or in rebuttal.  Along the way, the State offered
that "we don't have to get into the incidents that led up to her
getting the TRO or the circumstances resulting in the TRO, but we
do have to refer to it."  Feliciano's counsel conceded that "the
fact that there was a TRO is relevant, and it's going to come
in."  However, Feliciano did not ask that State's Exhibit 96, the
TRO Petition, be redacted.  At the end of this discussion, the
Circuit Court ruled that it would admit the TRO Petition.

subsequent granting of a Temporary Restraining Order by the
Court on August 18, 2014, provided to defense counsel on or
about March 30, 2016.
8NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
During CW's testimony, the prosecution read the
allegations made by CW in the TRO Petition and asked her about
them.  Upon defense objection to the allegations in the TRO
Petition being presented, argument out of the hearing of the jury
was had, where it was discussed that the specific allegations
were sworn-to in the TRO Petition but not documented anywhere
else.  CW denied that she filled out the form or made some of the
allegations in the TRO Petition and denied that she understood
what "under penalty of perjury" meant.  The court overruled
Feliciano's objection.
The record reflects extensive consideration of the
arguments in support of and in opposition to admission of the TRO
Petition.  These arguments focused on the probative value and
prejudicial effect of the evidence.  While the Circuit Court did
not make explicit its balancing of these factors on the record,
it is evident from its questions that it was aware of and
seriously considered them before making its ruling.
The TRO Petition was concededly relevant as it was
allegedly the reason why Feliciano accosted CW on the date of the
offense.  Like the other documents proffered by the State, the
statements contained in the TRO Petition were in writing and
sworn-to by CW.  HRE Rules 607, 613(b), 801, 802, and 802.1(1)
permit extrinsic evidence of prior inconsistent out-of-court
statements made by a witness questioned at trial about the
circumstances of and substance of those statements.  See Eastman,
81 Hawai# i at 135-37, 913 P.2d at 61-63.  CW denied making some
of the statements contained in the TRO Petition and the defense
was allowed to cross-examine her about the substance and
circumstances of her statements.  Like the other evidence of
prior bad acts, the statements were relevant to the relationship
of the parties and the TRO Petition was especially powerful as it
established the setting for the events of the charged offense. 
While not reflecting well on Feliciano, the matters alleged were
not unlike the matters contained in the other prior bad act
evidence and were likewise unlikely to rouse the jury to
overmastering hostility towards him.  We therefore conclude the
9NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the TRO
Petition.
For the foregoing reasons we affirm the August 17, 2016
Judgment, Conviction and Sentence entered by the Circuit Court of
the Second Circuit.
