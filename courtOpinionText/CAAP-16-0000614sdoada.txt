 HRS ยง 711-1106(1)(b) states:
 
ยง 711-1106 Harassment. (1) A person commits the offense of
harassment if, with intent to harass, annoy, or alarm any other
person, that person:
. . .
 (b) Insults, taunts, or challenges another
person in a manner likely to provoke an immediate
violent response or that would cause the other person
to reasonably believe that the actor intends to cause
bodily injury to the recipient or another or damage to
the property of the recipient or another;
. . . .

On appeal, Naki contends there was insufficient
 
evidence to convict her, specifically, that there was
 
insufficient evidence showing that Naki intended to harass,
 annoy, or alarm the complaining witness (CW), and that Naki did
 in fact insult, taunt, or challenge CW in a manner likely to
 provoke an immediate violent response or cause CW to reasonably
 believe that Naki intended to cause bodily injury to CW or damage
 to the property of CW.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Naki's point of error as follows, and affirm.
 
In considering the evidence adduced at trial in the 
strongest light for the prosecution, State v. Matavale, 115 
Hawai
'i 149, 157-58, 166 P.3d 322, 330-31 (2007), we conclude 
that there was sufficient evidence to support Naki's conviction for Harassment under HRS ยง 711-1106(1)(b). 
First, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence 
showing that Naki had the intent to harass, annoy, or alarm CW. "[T]he mind of an alleged offender may be read from his acts, conduct and inferences fairly drawn from all the circumstances." State v. Stocker, 90 Hawai
'i 85, 92, 976 P.2d 399, 406 (1999) 
(quoting State v. Sadino, 64 Haw. 427, 429, 642 P.2d 534, 537 (1982)). Here, Naki first passed CW at some distance without incident, but later returned in the opposite direction and began yelling at CW from afar. Naki then proceeded to retrieve her shoes from her vehicle before confronting CW and challenging her to a fight. In light of the circumstantial evidence, it is reasonable to infer that Naki intended to harass, annoy, or alarm CW. 
Lastly, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence
 
showing that Naki did in fact insult, taunt, or challenge CW in a
 manner likely to provoke an immediate violent response. At
 trial, CW testified that Naki told CW that she was ready to
 fight, and that Naki stated "you no more your backup, your
 bodyguard to protect you now," "well, let's go, let's go," and

"we going right now."3 By having challenged CW to a fight "right
 
now," it is reasonable to infer that Naki challenged CW in a
 
manner likely to provoke an immediate violent response.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Amended
 
Judgment and Notice of Entry of Judgment, filed on August 11,
 2016 in the District Court of the First Circuit, Kaneohe Division
 is affirmed.

 The District Court credited CW's testimony. "It is well-settled
 
that an appellate court will not pass upon issues dependent upon the
credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence; this is the province
of the trier of fact." State v. Mattiello, 90 Hawai' i 255, 259, 978 P.2d 693,
697 (1999) (internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets omitted; block
quote format changed).
