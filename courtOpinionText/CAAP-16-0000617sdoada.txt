IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
MICHAEL YELLEN, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 3DTI-16-010565)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, and Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Defendant-Appellant Michael Yellen, pro se, appeals 
from a "Judgment After Trial De Novo & Notice Of Entry Of 
Judgment," entered on August 30, 2016, in the District Court of the Third Circuit, North and South Hilo Division ("District Court").
1 The District Court entered judgment in favor of 
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai 'i after finding that Yellen 
committed one count of Noncompliance With Speed Limit, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes section 291C-102(a)(1) (2007).
2 
On appeal, Yellen argues that the District Court (i)
 
erred in finding that he committed the offense and violated his
 constitutional rights because the police officer who cited him
 did not advise him of his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384
 U.S. 436 (1966), prior to questioning him; and (2) erred in

motor vehicle at a speed greater than the maximum speed limit other than
provided in section 291C-105[.]" Haw. Rev. Stat. § 291C-102(a)(1).

denying his request for issuance of a subpoena duces tecum.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Yellen's points of error as follows.
 
Yellen has failed to comply with Hawai
'i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(4), which provides that the opening brief must include citations to the record where the alleged error occurred and was objected to or brought to the court's attention. Further, he has failed to meet his burden to provide a transcript of the proceedings relevant to his points of error. See Haw. R. App. P. 10(b)(1)(A). However, "this court has consistently adhered to the policy of affording litigants the opportunity to have their cases heard on the merits, where possible." Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai
'i 225, 230, 909 
P.2d 553, 558 (1995); see Thomas-Yukimura v. Yukimura, 130 Hawai
'i 1, 10 n.19, 304 P.3d 1182, 1191 n.19 (2013) (holding that 
trial transcripts are not always necessary for appellate review if "it is possible to determine that the [trial] court erred without recourse to the transcript.") 
Yellen's first point of error lacks merit. A police 
officer is not required to advise a driver of his or her Miranda rights before asking routine questions necessary to investigate a traffic infraction. See Haw. Rev. Stat. § 291D-2 & -3(a) (2007); 
State v. Kauhi, 86 Hawai
'i 195, 204, 948 P.2d 1036, 1045 (1997) 
(holding that two criteria are required before Miranda rights must be given: "(1) the defendant must be under interrogation; and (2) the defendant must be in custody"); Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U.S. 420, 440 (1984) ("persons temporarily detained pursuant to [a routine traffic stop] are not in custody for the purposes of Miranda"; State v. Wyatt, 67 Haw. 293, 299, 687 P.2d 544, 549­50 (1984) (holding that Miranda warnings were not required after defendant was stopped for driving with unlit headlamps, in violation of the city traffic code, and asked for her driver's license and other documentation, where the circumstances did not show that the defendant was in custody or being interrogated). Therefore, Yellen has not established the violation of any

constitutional right.
 
Based on the limited record before us, we cannot 
ascertain whether or how the District Court "denied" his subpoena 
duces tecum, although it appears to have been served; or whether the State actually failed to produce the evidence Yellen sought to compel and, if so, why. We cannot determine whether Yellen objected to any failure to comply with the subpoena, or whether Yellen's cross examination of the police officer who issued the ticket was impeded by the lack of any evidence sought by the subpoena. Because the record on appeal is insufficient, the court cannot consider the merits of Yellen's second point of error. See Haw. R. App. P. Rule 10(b)(1)(A); Bettencourt, 80 
Hawai
'i at 230, 909 P.2d at 558. Therefore, we disregard the 
point. See Haw. R. App. P. 28(b)(4). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Judgment
 
After Trial De Novo & Notice Of Entry Of Judgment," entered on
 August 30, 2016, in the District Court of the Third Circuit,
 North and South Hilo Division, is affirmed.
