v.
JOHN LOPEZ, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
(CR. NO. 15-1-250K)
MEMORANDUM OPINION
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Ginoza and Chan, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant John Lopez (Lopez) appeals from the
"Judgment of Conviction and Sentence" entered on August 11, 2016,
in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit (circuit court ).1
On appeal, Lopez contends that the circuit court erred
when it sentenced him without properly applying the retroactive
provisions of Act 231 (2016) (Act Relating to Administration of
Justice), namely Section 70(3).  Lopez argues that under Act 231,
Section 70(3), he should not have been sentenced to a mandatory
minimum term and that the circuit court should have at least
considered probation. 
For the reasons discussed below, we vacate Lopez's
sentence and remand for resentencing.

I.  Background
On September 4, 2015, Plaintiff-Appellee State of
Hawai#i (State) charged Lopez by complaint with numerous counts,
including Count 2 for Methamphetamine Trafficking in the First
Degree (First Degree Meth Trafficking) in violation of Hawai #i
Revised Statutes (HRS ) § 712-1240.7(1)(a) (2014).2 
On June 14, 2016, a jury trial commenced.  At the close
of the second day of trial, Lopez pled guilty to, inter alia ,
Count 2.  Sentencing was scheduled for August 11, 2016. 
On July 1, 2016, Act 231 took effect.3  2016 Haw. Sess.
Laws Act 231, § 72 at 776.  Pursuant to Act 231, inter alia ,
possession of one ounce or more of methamphetamine (which is the
basis for Count 2 in this case) is reclassified from First Degree
Meth Trafficking to the offense of Promoting a Dangerous Drug in
the First Degree ( First Degree PDD ) under HRS § 712-1241 (Supp.
2016).4  2016 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 231, §§ 52, 54 at 763-64.  Both
2  At the time Lopez was charged, HRS § 712-1240.7 (2014) provided, in
relevant part:
[§712-1240.7]  Methamphetamine trafficking in the first
degree.  (1) A person commits the offense of methamphetamine
trafficking in the first degree if the person knowingly:
(a) Possesses one or more preparations, compounds,
mixtures, or substances of an aggregate weight of one
ounce or more containing methamphetamine or any of its
salts, isomers, and salts of isomers[.]
. . . .
3  Although Act 231 became law without the Governor's signature on July
11, 2016, the provisions of the Act relevant to this case became effective on
July 1, 2016.  2016 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 231, § 72 at 776.
4  HRS § 712-1241, located in part IV of Chapter 712, and as amended by
Act 231 § 54, provides in relevant part:
§712-1241  Promoting a dangerous drug in the first degree.
(1) A person commits the offense of promoting a dangerous
drug in the first degree if the person knowingly:
(a) Possesses one or more preparations, compounds, mixtures,
or substances of an aggregate weight of:
(i) One ounce or more, containing methamphetamine,
heroin, morphine, or cocaine or any of their
respective salts, isomers, and salts of isomers
. . . .

First Degree Meth Trafficking and First Degree PDD are class A
felonies.  HRS § 712-1240.7(2); HRS § 712-1241(2).  However, for
a violation of First Degree Meth Trafficking, a defendant "shall
be sentenced to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of twenty
years" with a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment, as set
forth in HRS § 712-1240.7(3).  For a violation of First Degree
PDD under HRS § 712-1241, a court may sentence a defendant to
twenty years imprisonment, but there is no mandatory minimum term
of imprisonment, and the defendant may be sentenced to a term of
probation.  See  HRS § 706-659 (2014); HRS § 706-620(2) (2014).5
On August 11, 2016, the circuit court sentenced Lopez
to an indeterminate prison term of twenty years, with a mandatory
minimum term of eight years for Count 2. 
On August 22, 2016, Lopez filed a "Motion for
Correction of Sentence" requesting that the circuit court 
resentence him consistent with Act 231.  The circuit court denied
the motion.
On September 9, 2016, Lopez timely filed his Notice of
Appeal.
(...continued)
(2) Promoting a dangerous drug in the first degree is a
class A felony.
5  HRS § 706-659 provides in relevant part:
§706-659  Sentence of imprisonment for class A felony.
. . . .  A person who has been convicted of a class A felony
defined in chapter 712, part IV . . . may be sentenced to an
indeterminate term of imprisonment, except as provided for in
section 706-660.1 relating to the use of firearms in certain
felony offenses and section 706-606.5 relating to repeat
offenders. When ordering such a sentence, the court shall impose
the maximum length of imprisonment which shall be twenty years.
The minimum length of imprisonment shall be determined by the
Hawaii paroling authority in accordance with section 706-669.
In turn, HRS § 706-620(2) provides in relevant part:
§706-620  Authority to withhold sentence of imprisonment.   A
defendant who has been convicted of a crime may be sentenced to a
term of probation unless:
. . . .
(2) The crime is a class A felony, except class A felonies defined
in chapter 712, part IV, and by section 707-702[.]

II.  Discussion
The sole issue in this appeal is whether Section 70 of
Act 231 applies in this case, such that Lopez should have been
sentenced in a manner consistent with a violation of First Degree
PDD under HRS § 712-1241, rather than the mandatory sentencing
for First Degree Meth Trafficking under HRS § 712-1240.7(3).
We must construe the relevant provisions of Act 231. 
In this regard, our "foremost obligation is to ascertain and give
effect to the intention of the legislature, which is to be
obtained primarily from the language contained in the statute
itself."  State v. Nicol , 140 Hawai #i 482, 486, 403 P.3d 259, 263
(2017) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).
Section 70 of Act 231 provides:
SECTION 70.   This Act does not affect rights and
duties that matured, penalties that were incurred, and
proceedings that were begun before its effective date;
provided that sections 54, 55, and 56 shall apply to
offenses committed before the effective date of this Act:
(1) But not yet charged as of its effective date;
(2) Originally charged as a violation of section
712-1240.7 or 712-1240.8, Hawaii Revised
Statutes, where the defendant:
(a) Has not yet been placed in jeopardy or
convicted on a plea or verdict; and
(b) Waives any claim of denial of speedy trial
rights for the period elapsing between the
date of filing of the original charge and
the date of filing of the new charge under
this Act;
(3)Originally charged as a violation of section
712-1240.7 or 712-1240.8, Hawaii Revised
Statutes, for which the defendant has been
convicted on a plea or verdict, but not yet
sentenced, in which case the defendant shall be
sentenced pursuant to this Act; and
(4) Originally charged as a violation of section
712-1240.7 or 712-1240.8, Hawaii Revised
Statutes, for which the defendant has been
convicted on a plea or verdict and sentenced but
for which no final judgment on appeal has been
entered, in which case the appellate court shall
either:
(a) Remand the case for sentencing
pursuant to this Act if the judgment
is affirmed on appeal or if the
sentence is vacated; or
(b) Remand the case for further
proceedings pursuant to this Act if
the judgment is reversed and
remanded for further proceedings.
2016 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 231, § 70 at 775-76 (emphasis added).
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
The State's position is that Section 70(2)(a) of Act
231 precludes application of Section 70(3) to this case, because
prior to Lopez entering his guilty plea he had been placed in
jeopardy when the jury was empaneled and sworn.  At the hearing
on Lopez's motion for correction of sentence, the circuit court
agreed with the State, stating in part: "But under [Section
70(2)(a)] it says has not yet been placed in jeopardy or
convicted on a plea or verdict.  Hasn't he been placed in
jeopardy because the witnesses have testified? "  The State thus
argues that "[t]he 'options' laid out in the remaining portion of
70(2), (3), (4) are all dependent on whether jeopardy has
attached as it did in this case."  We disagree.
The State's argument is inconsistent with the intent of
the legislature set forth in Section 70.  Based on our reading of
Section 70, the legislature intended, 
inter alia , that Section 54
(the revised version of First Degree PDD) shall apply to offenses
committed before the effective date of Act 231 where any of the
separate circumstances exist as described in Section 70,
subsections (1) through (4).  With regard to this case, a plain
reading of Section 70 indicates that subsection (3) applies.6
The State's argument is also inconsistent with the
Hawai#i Supreme Court's recent decision in State v. Bovee , 139
Hawai#i 530, 394 P.3d 760 (2017).  Bovee was convicted by a jury
of second degree methamphetamine trafficking, and judgement was
entered against him in July 2014, prior to the effective date of
Act 231.  Id. at 536, 394 P.3d at 766; 2016 Haw. Sess. Laws Act
231, § 72 at 776.  The fact that Bovee was "in jeopardy" upon the
empaneling of his jury did not preclude the supreme court from
applying the relevant retroactive Act 231 provision to his case. 
6 The State's interpretation of Section 70 would essentially render
superfluous significant parts of subsections (3) and (4).  However, "[c]ourts
are bound to give effect to all parts of a statute, and . . . no clause,
sentence, or word shall be construed as superfluous, void, or insignificant if
a construction can be legitimately found which will give force to and preserve
all words of the statute."  Keliipuleole v. Wilson , 85 Hawai #i 217, 221, 941
P.2d 300, 304 (1997).
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Id. at 543-44, 394 P.3d at 773-74.  There, Bovee had been
convicted and sentenced, but his appeal was still pending, when
Act 231 took effect.  The supreme court held that, if this
court's affirmance of Bovee's conviction had been correct, the
case should have been remanded for resentencing under Act 231,
Section 70(4)(a).  Id. at 544, 394 P.3d at 774.
A similar analysis should apply here to Lopez.  That
is, Lopez was originally charged for Count 2 under HRS § 712-
1240.7(1)(a) which falls within the purview of Act 231, he pled
guilty after his jury trial had commenced, and, as of the
effective date of Act 231, he had not yet been sentenced.  Thus,
pursuant to Section 70(3) of Act 231, the circuit court should
have sentenced Lopez consistent with the offense of First Degree
PDD under HRS § 712-1241, rather than an offense requiring
sentencing under HRS § 712-1240.7(3).
III.  Conclusion
Based on the above, Lopez's sentence set forth in the
Judgment of Conviction and Sentence, filed in the Circuit Court
of the Third Circuit on August 11, 2016, is vacated.  The case is
remanded to the circuit court for resentencing.
