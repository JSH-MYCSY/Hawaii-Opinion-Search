STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
BURT CALAYCAY, also known as BURT F. CALAYCAY,
Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CASE NO. 1DCW-15-0001327)
ORDER DISMISSING THE APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
appellate jurisdiction over the appeal by Defendant-Appellant
Burt Calaycay, also known as Burt F. Calaycay (Appellant ) from
the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order, filed on August 22,
2016 (8/22/16 Order), in the District Court of the First Circuit
(district court ), because the district court has not yet entered
a final judgment that satisfies the requirements for an
appealable final decision or final judgment under Hawaii Revised
Statutes ( HRS) § 641-12 (Supp. 2015).NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
-2-"Appeals from the district court, in criminal cases,
are authorized by HRS §641-12, which . . . provides in pertinent
part that appeals upon the record shall be allowed from all final
decisions and final judgments of district courts in all criminal
matters."  State v. Ontiveros , 82 Hawai #i 446, 449, 923 P.2d 388,
391 (1996) (internal quotation marks, emphasis, and brackets
omitted).  With respect to the "criminal matter" requirement for
an appeal under HRS § 641-12 (Supp. 2015), "[a]n offense . . .
for which a sentence of imprisonment is authorized constitutes a
crime."  HRS § 701-107(1) (Repl. 2014).   This case qualifies as
a criminal matter because Harassment, in violation of § 711-
1106(1)(b) and (f) (Repl. 2014), is a petty misdemeanor
punishable by imprisonment pursuant to § 706-663 (Repl. 2014).
"'[I]n order to appeal a criminal matter in the
district court, the appealing party must appeal from a written
judgment or order that has been filed with the clerk of the court
pursuant to HRAP [Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure] Rule
4(b)(3)."  State v. Bohannon, 102 Hawai #i 228, 236, 74 P.3d 980,
988 (2003) (emphasis omitted).  The 8/22/16 Order satisfies the
written judgment requirement under HRAP Rule 4(b)(3).
Although this is a criminal matter and the 8/22/16
Order satisfies the written judgment requirement, the 8/22/16
Order is not final and appealable because it does not include an
adjudication and sentence.  Hawai# i Rules of Penal Procedure Rule
32(c)(2)  provides, "A judgment of conviction in the district
court shall set forth the disposition of the proceedings and the
same shall be entered on the record of the court."  Under Rule
32(c)(2), "a document is not a judgment of conviction unless itNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
-3-includes the adjudication and the sentence."  State v. Kilborn ,
109 Hawai #i 435, 127 P.3d 95 (App. 2005).   
The district court issued a March 11, 2016 Notice of
Entry of Judgment and/or Order that includes an adjudication but
no sentence, only a "proposed sentence."  The 8/22/16 Order does
not include an adjudication or a sentence.  No order or judgment
including an adjudication and sentence appears in the record on
appeal.  
Hence, this court lacks jurisdiction over the appeal,
under HRS § 641-12.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal in
appellate case number CAAP-16-0000628 is dismissed for lack of
appellate jurisdiction. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, January 10, 2017.
