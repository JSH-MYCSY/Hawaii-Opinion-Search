SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant William Halemano Frederick 
(Frederick), pro se, appeals from the "Order Denying Defendants'

of Damon Stanford Filed on August 8, 2016," filed on September
 30, 2016, in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit
 
court).

(CPB), by way of a motion based on Hawai 'i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) Rule 60(b).2

On appeal, Frederick contends that:
1. The Lower Court abused its discretion when it
 
effectively held that CPB did not need to prove it was
the real party in interest and had standing to
judicially foreclose on the subject property prior to
filing its complaint. The affidavit proffered in
support of Summary judgment contain false statements;
absent those false statement, Summary Judgment would
not have been granted.
 
2. As a result of the aforementioned, the Lower Court
incorrectly denied HOMEOWNERS Verified Emergency
Motion for Void Judgment Due to the Affidavit of Damon
Stanford.
 
In his amended opening brief, Frederick raised the
 
following points of error: 
a) Whether the lower court abused its discretion in
not applying the correct laws regarding contracts. 
b) Whether state law can override federal
constitutional provisions guaranteed by the U.S.
constitution. Art. I § 10 cl. 1, and the Fifth and
Fourteenth Amendment. 
2 HRCP Rule 60(b) provides, in pertinent part:
 
Rule 60. Relief from judgment order.
. . . .
 
(b) Mistakes; Inadvertence; Excusable Neglect; Newly
Discovered Evidence; Fraud, etc. On motion and upon such
terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or a
party's legal representative from a final judgment, order,
or proceeding for the following reasons: (1) mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly
discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have
been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule
 59(b); (3) fraud . . ., misrepresentation, or other
misconduct of an adverse party; (4) the judgment is void;
. . . .
3 In addition to Frederick, the Complaint named several other
defendants who did not appeal. Thus, Frederick is the only appellant in this
appeal.

 Frederick filed his opening brief on January 3, 2017, and thereafter
sought leave to amend his opening brief. On March 21, 2017, this courtgranted Frederick's request to amend his opening brief. On April 17, 2017,Frederick filed his amended opening brief. Frederick's opening brief andamended opening brief fail to comply with Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure
(HRAP) Rule 28 because, among other things, they do not provide recordcitations, which raises the potential for dismissal of the appeal.Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai' i 225, 230, 909 P.2d 553, 558 (1995).
However, because we seek to address cases on the merits where possible, weaddress Frederick's arguments to the extent they are discernable. Id.

c) Whether the constitutional rights to property under
the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment, was subverted by
the Plaintiff-Appellees, by underhandedly trying to
obtain the Appellant's property, through a merger, not
covered by contractual law of the original lender.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant legal authorities, we resolve Frederick's
 points of error as follows, and we affirm.
 
On April 30, 2015, the circuit court granted CPB's 
motion for summary judgment seeking a decree of foreclosure and also entered a Judgment on the decree of foreclosure (Foreclosure 
Judgment). Frederick, along with Mary Katherine Frederick 
(together, the Fredericks), appealed from the Foreclosure 
Judgment. This court, in Cent. Pac. Bank v. Frederick, No. CAAP­
15-0000425, 2016 WL 3219238, at *3 (Haw. App. June 9, 2016) (SDO), affirmed the circuit court's Foreclosure Judgment. In that prior appeal, we concluded, inter alia, that CPB had standing to foreclose on the Note and that the Affidavit of Damon Stanford (Stanford), an Assistant Vice President and Manager of 
Investor Mortgage Servicing of CPB, was admissible. Id. at *1-2. 
The Fredericks filed a motion for reconsideration, which this 
court denied on June 27, 2016. The Fredericks did not file an application for Writ of Certiorari to the Hawai
'i Supreme Court. 
On July 11, 2016, the circuit court granted CPB's
 
motion for confirmation of sale for the subject property.
 
On August 8, 2016, Frederick filed the subject
 
"Defendants Verified Emergency Motion for Void Judgment Due to
 the Affidavit of Damon Stanford" (Rule 60(b) Motion). 
Frederick's motion challenged Stanford's Affidavit on a number of
 
5
grounds  and asserted in essence that CPB did not have standing
to foreclose on the property. 
Although his motion purported to

 For example, Fredrick asserted that Stanford's Affidavit failed to
attach documents (thus violating Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 901 and
HRCP Rule 56(e)), was not based on Stanford's personal knowledge, and included
impermissible conclusions of law.

be filed pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b)(1), (2), (3), and (4), no
 
argument was made related to these provisions.6
 
On September 1, 2016, the circuit court issued a minute
 
order stating that it intended to enter a written order denying
 Frederick's Rule 60(b) Motion. On September 30, 2016, the
 circuit court filed the written order denying Frederick's Rule
 60(b) Motion. Frederick timely filed a notice of appeal, which
 resulted in this appeal.
 
In his appellate briefs, Frederick does not address the 
requirements under HRCP Rule 60(b). Instead, he asserts arguments directly challenging the Foreclosure Judgment. Thus, Frederick has waived any issues or arguments under HRCP Rule 60(b). See Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 
28(b)(4) and (7). 
As to the points and arguments that he does raise in 
this appeal, they relate to the Foreclosure Judgment which has previously been affirmed in Cent. Pac. Bank v. Frederick, No. CAAP-15-0000425, 2016 WL 3219238 (Haw. App. June 9, 2016) (SDO). The doctrine of res judicata precludes Frederick from relitigating the validity of the Foreclosure Judgment. Mortg. 
Elec. Registration Sys., Inc. v. Wise, 130 Hawai
'i 11, 16-18, 304 
P.3d 1192, 1197-99 (2013). Further, even if Frederick articulated an argument under HRCP Rule 60(b)(4), that the Foreclosure Judgment is void for lack of standing, he would not prevail. See Nationstar Mortg. LLC v. Akepa Props. LLC, Nos. 
CAAP-15-0000407, CAAP-15-0000727, 2017 WL 1401468, at *2 (Haw. App. Apr. 19, 2017) (SDO) (holding that lack of standing does not render a ruling void under HRCP Rule 60(b)(4)).

 Frederick also cited HRCP Rule 56(g) in his motion, but likewise made
no argument in regard to this rule.

 In any event, the record shows that there was no transfer of the Note
in this case, and Stanford's Affidavit established that: (1) on or about
January 28, 2008, the Fredericks executed a Note in favor of lender CentralPacific Homeloans, Inc.; and on February 1, 2012, Central Pacific Homeloans,Inc. merged with and into CPB. Therefore, there appears to be no standingissue under the Hawai' i Supreme Court's recent opinion in Bank of America,
