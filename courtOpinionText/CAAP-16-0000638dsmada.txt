DAVID BRADLEY EISENBREY, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
KATHLEEN ANN EISENBREY, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-M NO. 15-1-0005)

 
ORDER DISMISSING THE APPEAL
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
Upon review of the record, it appears that:
 
(1) On September 26, 2016, Defendant-Appellant Kathleen
 
Ann Eisenbrey (Appellant), pro se, filed a notice of appeal;
 
(2) On November 22, 2016, the family court clerk filed 
the record on appeal, and the appellate clerk notified the parties that the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief were due on or before December 2, 2016, and January 2, 2017, respectively. Because January 2, 2017, was a holiday, the opening brief was effectively due on or before January 3, 2017. See Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 26(a); NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
(3) Appellant did not file the statement of
 
jurisdiction, or request an extension of time;
 
(4) On January 3, 2017, the appellate clerk granted
 
Appellant an extension of time for the opening brief to February
 
2, 2017;
 
(5) Appellant did not file the opening brief, or
 
request another extension of time;
 
(6) On February 23, 2017, the appellate clerk notified
 
Appellant that the time for filing the statement of jurisdiction
 and opening brief had expired, the matter would be called to the
 court’s attention on March 6, 2017, for appropriate action, which
 could include dismissal of the appeal, pursuant to HRAP Rules
 12.1(e) and 30, and Appellant may request relief from default by
 motion; and 
(7)
 Thereafter, Appellant took no further action in the
 
appeal.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is
 
dismissed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, March 14, 2017.
