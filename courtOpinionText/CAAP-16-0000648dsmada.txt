 parties that the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief were
 due on or before December 2, 2016, and January 2, 2017,
 respectively;

and opening brief had expired,  the matter would be called to the
court’s attention on January 27, 2017, for appropriate action, which could include dismissal of the appeal, pursuant to Hawai
'i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rules 12.1(e) and 30, and Appellant may request relief from default by motion; 
(5) The appellate clerk mailed the notice of entering
 
case on calendar and the default notice to Appellant at the
 address listed in the record on appeal. The United States Postal
 Service did not return the notice of entering case on calendar,
 but it did return the default notice, noting “insufficient
 address, unable to forward”; and
 
(6) Appellant did not submit a change of address
 
consistent with HRAP Rule 25(f), and otherwise took no further
 action in the appeal.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawaii, February 6, 2017.
