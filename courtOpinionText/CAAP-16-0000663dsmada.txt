APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
 
(CASE NO. AB 2014-019(WH))

(DCD NO. 9-04-45072)(M))
 
ORDER GRANTING THE MARCH 20, 2017 MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Upon consideration of pro se Claimant-Appellant 
Kenneth M. Skahan’s (Appellant) March 20, 2017 “Motion for
 
Reconsideration of the Order Dismissing the Appeal Dated 
March 14, 2017,” the papers in support, and the record, it
 appears that (1) on March 14, 2017, the court dismissed the
 appeal for failure to pay the appellate filing and docketing
 fees, which were due on or before January 23, 2017, and dismissed
 all pending motions, including Appellant’s February 20, 2017
 “‘Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction’, the Appeals of
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
October 10, 2016, and November 17, 2016”; (2) Appellant seeks 
reconsideration of the dismissal order, and a decision on his February 20, 2017 motion to dismiss the appeal, because at some point after March 8, 2017, he mailed payment to the Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board clerk; (3) the appellate clerk processed the filing and docketing fees payment on March 30, 2017; and (4) although Appellant paid the appellate filing and docketing fees late, there is good cause to grant the instant motion. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion for
 
reconsideration is granted, and the appeal is reinstated. The
 court will defer a determination on Appellant’s February 20, 2017
 motion to dismiss the appeal until after the record on appeal is
 filed in this case. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the clerk of the Labor and
 
Industrial Relations Appeals Board shall file the record on 
appeal within thirty days from the date of this order.
