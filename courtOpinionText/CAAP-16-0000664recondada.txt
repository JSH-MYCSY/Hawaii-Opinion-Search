ORDER DENYING THE APRIL 21, 2020 MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
(By: 
Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of "Appellant's Motion for 
Reconsideration of the April 21, 2020 Order Dismissing the 
Appellant's April 14, 2020 Motion for Reconsideration As Untimely" ( Motion ), filed on April 21, 2020, the papers in 
support and the record herein, 
(1) Appellant Kenneth Skahan ( Skahan ) incorrectly 
asserts that due to technical difficulties his motion seeking reconsideration of our Summary Disposition Order was not filed until April 14, 2020. 
(2) Rather, the record reflects that Skahan timely 
filed a motion for reconsideration on April 13, 2020, and also filed an untimely motion for reconsideration on April 14, 2020. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI# I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
