IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
KENNETH M. SKAHAN, Claimant-Appellant,
v.
STUTTS CONSTRUCTION COMPANY, LTD., Employer-Appellee,
and
FIRST INSURANCE COMPANY OF HAWAII, LTD.,
Insurance Carrier-Appellee
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
(CASE NO.: AB 2014-041 (WH); DCD NO.: 9-13-45106(M))
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Wadsworth, JJ.)
This appeal arises out of a WC-5 Employee's Claim for
Workers' Compensation Benefits form filed by Claimant-Appellant
Kenneth M. Skahan ( Skahan) in the State of Hawai# i Department of
Labor and Industrial Relations Disability Compensation Division
on August 19, 2013.  In his claim, Skahan sought benefits from
his former employer, Employer-Appellee Stutts Construction
Company, Inc., which is insured by Insurance Carrier-Appellee
First Insurance Company of Hawaii, Ltd. (collectively referred to
as Stutts Construction), for injuries to his lower back and
thoracic spine that he claims became disabling on April 7, 2013.
On January 10, 2014, the Director of Labor and Industrial
Relations ( Director) issued a written decision and order denying NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Skahan's claim because Skahan was not employed by Stutts
Construction on the claimed date of injury.  1
In this appeal, Skahan, who is self-represented,
appeals from the "Decision and Order" ( LIRAB Decision) entered by
the State of Hawai# i Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board
(LIRAB) on June 17, 2016, which affirmed in part and reversed in
part the Director's written decision and order.  The LIRAB found
that Skahan's claim for benefits for a thoracic spine injury in
the form of Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal Hyperostosis (DISH) was
causally related to a November 30, 2004 work injury that Skahan
sustained while employed with Stutts Construction,  and was not a
claim for a new injury occurring on April 7, 2013.  The LIRAB
thus concluded that any benefits for Skahan's DISH injury should
be determined under a separate claim related to the November 30,
2004 injury, in a separate proceeding that was then ongoing. 
With regard to Skahan's claim of a lower back injury, the LIRAB
concluded it was not causally related to the November 30, 2004
work incident and thus denied Skahan's claim related to the lower
back injury.2
Skahan asserts ten points of error in this appeal.  We
construe Skahan's points of error to challenge the LIRAB's: (1)
designation of the sole issue to be determined in the LIRAB
appeal; (2) findings of fact ( FOF) and conclusions of law (COL )
pertaining to LIRAB's determination that Skahan's April 7, 2013
DISH injury was causally related to his prior November 30, 2004
work injury, and thus any benefits must be determined under the
prior claim; and (3) FOFs and COLs pertaining to LIRAB's
conclusion that Stutts Construction met its burden of production
and persuasion to show that Skahan did not have any lower back 
1  The record reflects that Skahan was employed with Stutts Construction
until December 3, 2004.
2  Under a previous claim, Skahan claimed injury to his thoracic spine
and right rib cage due to a work accident on November 30, 2004, which occurred
while he was lifting or moving a garage door. 
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
condition that could be causally related to the November 30, 2004
work incident.  3
Upon careful review of the record and briefs submitted
by the parties and having given due consideration to the
arguments and issues they raise, as well as relevant legal
authorities, we affirm.
(1) Issue on appeal before the LIRAB
In his first point of error, Skahan challenges the
LIRAB's designation of the sole issue to be determined in
Skahan's appeal to LIRAB from the Director's decision.  Skahan's
argument has no merit.  The LIRAB Decision states "[t]he sole
issue to be determined on this appeal is whether [Skahan]
sustained a personal injury involving his low back and thoracic
spine on April 7, 2013, arising out of and in the course of
employment."  This is substantively identical to the issue
determined by the Director in his written decision and order, and
directly addresses Skahan's August 19, 2013 claim for workers'
compensation benefits for his alleged injuries sustained on April
7, 2013.
Further, Hawai#i Administrative Rules (HAR ) § 12-47-20
states that "[t]he board may decline to hear and determine any
issue which the director in the decision on appeal did not decide
or left for future determination."  LIRAB was not required to
decide issues beyond those addressed by the Director.
(2) Skahan's points of error pertaining to his DISH
   claim are moot
In points of error 2 through 7, Skahan appears to
challenge various FOFs and COLs which pertain to the LIRAB's
determination that Skahan's August 19, 2013 claim of a DISH
injury was causally related to the November 30, 2004 work injury,
3  In his appeal, Skahan specifically challenges FOFs 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9, 10, 13, 15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, 34, and 35. 
Skahan also purports to challenge COLs 3, 4, 5, and 6, however, the LIRAB did
not designate its COLs numerically.
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
and thus was not a claim for a new injury occurring on April 7,
2013.  Skahan appears to assert that the LIRAB should have
treated his DISH condition as a "disease proximately caused by or
resulting from the nature of the employment" with Stutts
Construction under Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 386-3 (2015),  
but that the LIRAB erred in holding that his DISH claim should be
determined under the November 30, 2004 claim and proceeding,
rather than as a new injury or occupational disease under the
August 19, 2013 claim.4
We discern no prejudice to Skahan by the LIRAB's
decision to address his DISH claim in the proceedings related to
the November 30, 2004 incident, which were still pending before
the LIRAB at the time.  Indeed, LIRAB issued a Decision and Order
in Case No. AB 2014-019, arising from the November 2004 claim, on
June 21, 2016 ( 6/21/16 LIRAB Decision), just four days after the
LIRAB Decision in this case.
Indeed, because the 6/21/16 LIRAB Decision in Case No.
AB 2014-019 determined, inter alia , the compensability of
Skahan's DISH claim, for purposes of this appeal the DISH claim
is moot.  Skahan has appealed from the 6/21/16 LIRAB Decision and
that appeal is currently pending in CAAP-16-0000663.  The
mootness doctrine is appropriate "where events subsequent to the
judgment of the trial court have so affected the relations
between the parties that the two conditions for justiciability
relevant on appeal — adverse interest and effective remedy — have
been compromised."  Lathrop v. Sakatani, 111 Hawai#i 307, 313,
141 P.3d 480, 486 (2006) (citation omitted).  Given that Skahan's
DISH claim was resolved by LIRAB in the 6/21/16 LIRAB Decision,
4  HRS § 386-3(a) provides, in relevant part:
§386-3 Injuries covered.   (a) If an employee suffers
personal injury either by accident arising out of and in the
course of the employment or by disease proximately caused by
or resulting from the nature of the employment, the
employee's employer or the special compensation fund shall
pay compensation to the employee or the employee's
dependents as provided in this chapter.
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
the merits of that claim were addressed in that proceeding.  In
this appeal, we can provide no effective remedy and the issue is
moot.
(3) Skahan's lower back injury claim
In points of error 8 through 10, Skahan challenges the
FOFs and COLs pertaining to the LIRAB's denial of his claim for
lower back injury.  Specifically, Skahan appears to assert that
the LIRAB erred in concluding that Stutts Construction met its
burden of production and persuasion to show that Skahan's lower
back injury was not causally related to the November 30, 2004
work injury, and thus not compensable.  After review of the
record, we conclude that the LIRAB did not err in denying
Skahan's August 19, 2013 claim for injuries to his lower back.
HRS § 386-85 (2015) states, in relevant part:
§386-85  Presumptions.  In any proceeding for the
enforcement of a claim for compensation under this chapter
it shall be presumed, in the absence of substantial evidence
to the contrary:
(1) That the claim is for a covered work injury[.]
"[T]o rebut the presumption, the employer has the burden of going
forward with the evidence, which is the burden of production, as
well as the burden of persuasion.  The burden of production means
that 'the employer must initially introduce substantial evidence
that, if true, could rebut the presumption that the injury is
work-related.'"  Panoke v. Reef Dev. of Hawaii, Inc., 136 Hawai# i
448, 461, 363 P.3d 296, 309 (2015) (citations omitted).
Here, the LIRAB relied on a report prepared by Dr.
Lorne K. Direnfeld, M.D. ( Dr. Direnfeld), dated July 19, 2013, in
support of its conclusion that Stutts Construction met its burden
to show that Skahan's low back condition was not causally related
to the November 30, 2004 work injury.  In his report, Dr.
Direnfeld notes that "[t]he contemporaneously documented medical
records do not reference a condition affecting Mr. Skahan's
lumbar spine in relation to the [November 30, 2004] industrial
accident."  Dr. Direnfeld further notes that "[n]o investigations
were required of the lumbar spine in Mr. Skahan's case in
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
relation to the [November 30, 2004] industrial accident[,]" and
that "Mr. Skahan himself attributes problems at the L4-5 disk
level to the effects of a prior work-related injury occurring in
1994[.]"  Accordingly, Dr. Direnfeld stated that "[b]ased on the
data available to [him], there is no indication of a condition
affecting the L4-5 level in Mr. Skahan's case in any way related
to the [November 30, 2004] industrial accident."
As noted by Dr. Direnfeld, the medical records relating
to the November 30, 2004 work injury did not document or show any
injury to Skahan's lower back.  The record does not indicate that
the November 30, 2004 claim was for injuries to Skahan's lower
back.  In its FOF 26, which Skahan does not challenge, the LIRAB
found that "[Skahan] suffered from a preexisting low back
condition that developed as a result of low back injuries dating
back to 1990's while he was working for another employer."  This
is consistent with Dr. Direnfeld's report, which noted that
Skahan attributed his lower back injuries to a prior work-related
injury which occurred in 1994, and not to the November 30, 2004
incident.
Further, Skahan does not cite to any part of the record
in this appeal that can relate his lower back injury to the
November 30, 2004 incident.  Skahan appears to rely on the
reports of Dr. Daniel A. Capen, M.D. (Dr. Capen ) to show that his
lower back condition was somehow aggravated or injured in the
November 30, 2004 incident.   However, as the LIRAB found,
nothing in Dr. Capen's reports produced in this record provides
any opinion or medical basis to relate Skahan's lower back injury
to the November 30, 2004 incident.  Skahan also does not dispute 5
5  Many of Skahan's citations to the record are to the record on appeal
in CAAP-16-0000663, which we need not consider.  Further, to the extent Skahan
makes factual assertions without proper record cites, we are not obligated to
search the record.  See Kamaka v. Goodsill Anderson Quinn & Stifel, 117
Hawai#i 92, 114 n.23, 176 P.3d 91, 113 n.23 (2008) (noting that "this court is
not obligated to sift through the voluminous record to verify an appellant's
inadequately documented contentions." (citation, brackets, and internal
quotation marks omitted)).
6NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
FOF 31, which states "[t]here is no evidence of any DISH
affecting [Skahan's] lumbar spine."
In sum, Dr. Direnfeld's report indicates that there is
no evidence that Skahan's lower back was injured or aggravated on
November 30, 2004, and Skahan does not cite to any part of the
record in this case that can relate his lower back injury to the
2004 claim.  Accordingly, the LIRAB did not err in concluding
that Stutts Construction had met its burden to show that Skahan's
lower back injury was not related to the November 30, 2004 work
incident.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Labor and
Industrial Relations Appeals Board's "Decision and Order", filed
June 17, 2016, is affirmed.
