I. BACKGROUND 
On January 4, 2016, UPW and the State of Hawai# i, 
Department of Transportation (State) began arbitration 
proceedings.2 The arbitration arose from a grievance filed by 
UPW on behalf of Glenn Tanaka, who had been discharged from his employment with the State, effective March 19, 2015. On the 
first day of the arbitration proceedings, the State made an oral 
motion to dismiss the grievance, arguing, among other things, 
that pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) in 
effect between the parties, UPW did not timely file the Step 1 
grievance and UPW was not permitted to file its Step 2 grievance 
without first having a Step 1 meeting. 
After receiving written briefs from the parties on the 
State's motion to dismiss, the Arbitrator issued his Decision on 
Arbitrability dated February 3, 2016, denying the State's motion. 
The Arbitrator determined that the State's defense of 
untimeliness was waived, as the CBA prohibits parties from 
raising allegations not asserted prior to arbitration and the 
State had not previously asserted that the grievance was untimely 
filed. The Arbitrator also determined that the CBA permitted UPW 
to file a Step 2 grievance although no Step 1 meeting occurred. 
The arbitration proceedings continued to its conclusion. 
On March 7, 2016, UPW filed a "Motion to Confirm 
Arbitration Decision and Award, to Enter Judgment, and For Other 
Appropriate Relief" (First Motion to Confirm) in the circuit 
court, requesting that the court: confirm the Decision on 
Arbitrability pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 658A-22 
2 Theodore I. Sakai (Arbitrator) presided over the arbitration 
proceedings.

and grant UPW attorney's fees and costs pursuant to HRS § 658A-
25(b) and (c). On May 6, 2016, the circuit court issued its 
Order Denying UPW's First Motion to Confirm  on the basis that 
the Decision on Arbitrability "does not constitute an 'Award' for the purposes of §658A-19  and §658A-22, HRS, but [is] simply an

award  at  which  time  the  court  shall  issue  a  confirming  order
unless  the  award  is  modified  or  corrected  pursuant  to  section

of  an  award.   The  record  shall  be  signed  or  otherwise
authenticated  by  any  arbitrator  who  concurs  with  the  award.

notice  of  the  award,  including  a  copy  of  the  award,  to  each
party  to  the  arbitration  proceeding.

intermediate decision not subject to confirmation under §658A-22, 
HRS." 
On June 20, 2016,7 The Arbitrator issued his Decision 
and Award, sustaining four of the ten charges that served for the 
basis of Glenn Tanaka's discharge, and reducing his disciplinary 
action from discharge to twenty days suspension with no back pay. 
The Decision and Award included a summary of the Decision on 
Arbitrability. 
On July 8, 2016, UPW filed a "Motion to Confirm 
Arbitration Decisions and Awards, to Enter Final Judgment, and 
For Appropriate Relief" (Second Motion to Confirm), requesting 
that the circuit court: confirm both the Decision on 
Arbitrability and the Decision and Award pursuant to HRS § 658A-
22; enter a final judgment for both decisions pursuant to HRS § 
658A-25(a); and grant appropriate relief including costs and 
attorney's fees pursuant to HRS § 658A-25(b) and (c). On 
September 16, 2016, the circuit court issued its Order Partially 
Granting/Denying UPW's Second Motion to Confirm, which: (1) 
granted UPW's request to confirm the Decision and Award, which 
had incorporated the Decision on Arbitrability, but did not 
confirm the Decision on Arbitrability as a separate award; (2) 
denied UPW's request for costs, finding that it was within the 
circuit court's discretion under HRS § 658A-25(b) and would be 
inequitable because the State prevailed on UPW's First Motion to 
Confirm and agreed not to seek costs; and (3) denied UPW's 
request for attorney's fees, determining that attorney's fees are 
not permissible under HRS § 658A-25(c) where the State did not 
contest confirmation of the Decision and Award. 
UPW timely appealed on October 10, 2016. 
7 The signature page on the Decision and Award is dated February 20, 
2016. However, both the State's Answering Brief and the circuit court's Order
Partially Granting/Denying UPW's Second Motion to Confirm indicate the date ofthe Decision and Award was actually June 20, 2016.

II. POINTS OF ERROR 
On appeal, UPW asserts that the circuit court erred by:
(1) not confirming the Decision on Arbitrability in the Order 
Denying UPW's First Motion to Confirm; (2) not confirming the 
Decision on Arbitrability as a separate award from the Decision 
and Award in the Order Partially Granting/Denying UPW's Second 
Motion to Confirm; (3) declining to award UPW attorney's fees and
costs associated with its Second Motion to Confirm. UPW also 
contends that if this court determines that the First Motion to 
Confirm should have been granted, then the circuit court erred in
not awarding attorney's fees and costs for that motion.  
 
 
III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A. Arbitration Awards 
"We review the circuit court's ruling on an arbitration
award de novo, but we also are mindful that the circuit court's 
review of arbitral awards must be extremely narrow and 
exceedingly deferential." 
Tatibouet v. Ellsworth, 99 Hawai# i 
226, 233, 54 P.3d 397, 404 (2002) (internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets omitted).  
Judicial review of an arbitration award is limited by
the following precepts: 
First, because of the legislative policy to
encourage arbitration and thereby discourage
litigation, arbitrators have broad discretion inresolving the dispute. Upon submission of an issue,the arbitrator has authority to determine the entirequestion, including the legal construction of terms ofa contract or lease, as well as the disputed facts.In fact, where the parties agree to arbitrate, theythereby assume all the hazards of the arbitrationprocess, including the risk that the arbitrators maymake mistakes in the application of law and in theirfindings of fact. 
Second, correlatively, judicial review of an
arbitration award is confined to the strictest possible limits. An arbitration award may be vacatedonly on the four grounds specified in HRS § 658-9 andmodified and corrected only on the three groundsspecified in HRS § 658-10. Moreover, the courts haveno business weighing the merits of the award. 
Third, HRS §§ 658-9 and -10 also restrict the
authority of appellate courts to review judgmentsentered by circuit courts confirming or vacating the 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
arbitration awards.

B. Statutory Interpretation 
Questions of statutory interpretation are questions of
law to be reviewed de novo under the right/wrong standard.  
Our statutory construction is guided by the following
well established principles: 
our foremost obligation is to ascertain and giveeffect to the intention of the legislature, which isto be obtained primarily from the language containedin the statute itself. And we must read statutorylanguage in the context of the entire statute andconstrue it in a manner consistent with its purpose. 
When there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or
indistinctiveness or uncertainty of an expression usedin a statute, an ambiguity exists. . . . 
In construing an ambiguous statute, "[t]he
meaning of the ambiguous words may be sought byexamining the context, with which the ambiguous words,phrases, and sentences may be compared, in order toascertain their true meaning. Moreover, the courtsmay resort to extrinsic aids in determininglegislative intent. One avenue is the use of legislative history as an interpretive tool." 
This court may also consider "[t]he reason and
spirit of the law, and the cause which induced thelegislature to enact it . . . to discover its truemeaning."

IV. DISCUSSION 
A. The Decision on Arbitrability was not an "award" subject to
confirmation under HRS § 658A-22
. 
In its Order Denying UPW's First Motion to Confirm, the
circuit court determined that based on our holding in United 
Public Workers, AFSCME, Local 646, AFL-CIO v. City and County of  
6          
              
      
          
           
        
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Honolulu, 124 Hawai# i 367, 244 P.3d 604 (App. 2010), the Decision 
on Arbitrability did "not constitute an 'Award' for the purposes 
of §658A-19 and §658A-22, HRS, but [was] simply an intermediate 
decision not subject to confirmation under §658A-22, HRS." 
On appeal, UPW asserts that the circuit court's 
determination was in error because HRS § 658A-19 amounts to a 
statutory definition of "award" and compliance with the statute 
resulted in the Decision on Arbitrability becoming an "award" 
subject to confirmation. UPW also cites various federal cases 
for the proposition that an arbitrator's intermediate decision 
may be confirmed by the circuit court if: (1) the parties agreed 
to bifurcate the proceedings; and/or (2) the decision finally and 
definitely disposes of a separate and independent claim. 
Additionally, UPW argues that United Public Workers, AFSCME, 
Local 646, AFL-CIO, 124 Hawai# i 367, 244 P.3d 604, is not 
controlling here because it was decided in the context of whether the court had appellate jurisdiction under HRS § 658A-28(a)(3).
8 
We first reject UPW's contention that HRS § 658A-19 
amounts to a statutory definition of "award" and that compliance 
with its provisions results in the arbitrator's decision becoming 
8 In cases involving arbitration, an appeal to the appellate courts
from a circuit court order or final judgment is authorized as set forth under HRS
§ 658A-28 (2016). The statute provides: 
[§658A-28] Appeals. (a) An appeal may be taken from: 
(1)  An  ord er  denying  a  motion  to  compel  arbitration;  
(2)  An  ord er  granting  a  motion  to  stay  arbitration; 
(3)  An  order  confirming  or  denying  confirmation  of  an
award; 
(4)  An  order  modifying  or  correcting  an  award;  
(5)  An  ord er  vacating  an  award  without  directing  a
rehearing;  or 
(6)  A  final  judgment  entered  pursuant  to  this  chapter. 
(b) An 
appeal under this section shall be taken as from
an order or a judgment in a civil action. 
(Emphases added.)

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
an "award." In Schmidt, 113 Hawai# i at 168, 150 P.3d at 817, the 
supreme court discussed whether an arbitration decision not in 
strict compliance with the statutory requirements of HRS § 658-
8,9 the predecessor statute to HRS § 658A-19,10 was an "award," 
which would trigger the time limitation for filing a motion to vacate once served. The supreme court held that "the statutory 
language under HRS § 658–8 and relevant case law indicate that 
formal acknowledgment or proof does not affect an award's 
validity as between the parties and may take place at any time 
prior to or at confirmation. . . . Thus, the proper focus of 
inquiry . . . is whether the award was final." Schmidt, 113 
Hawai# i at 171-72, 150 P.3d at 820-21. Applying the same 
analysis here, HRS § 658A-19 prescribes the form of an award, but 
compliance with its provisions does not in itself determine 
whether a decision is an "award" for the purposes of HRS § 658A-
22. 
Next, UPW is correct in its assertion that our analysis 
in United Public Workers, AFSCME, Local 646, AFL-CIO was limited 
to analyzing the term "award" in the context of HRS § 658A-28, 
the section governing appeals. Nonetheless, as discussed below, 
we find that our analysis of the term "award" in United Public 
Workers, AFSCME, Local 646, AFL-CIO is germane to the use of the 
term "award" in HRS § 658A-22, in the context of confirming 
awards. 
UPW argues that the Decision on Arbitrability was a 
confirmable award because: (1) the parties agreed to bifurcate 
the proceedings; and/or (2) the decision finally and definitely 
9 HRS § 658-8 (1993) provided that an "award shall be in writing and
acknowledged or proved in like manner as a deed for the conveyance of real
estate, and delivered to one of the parties or the party's attorney." 
10 "The former § 658–8 (Award and Confirming Award) was split into
§ 658A–19 (Supp. 2013) and § 658A–22 (Supp. 2013) . . . . This court has appliedcase law interpretations of HRS Chapter 658 to these successor provisions." Eggs

       NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
disposed of a separate and independent claim. UPW's argument is 
based on case law from federal courts in other jurisdictions, 
recognizing exceptions to the Federal Arbitration Act's (FAA) 
general rule that a district court only has the power to confirm 
or vacate a final arbitration award. See, e.g., Trade & Transp., 
Inc. v. Natural Petroleum Charterers Inc., 931 F.2d 191, 195 (2d Cir. 1991) (stating that exceptions to the general rule exist in 
cases where the arbitrators decide a separate, independent claim, 
or where the parties expressly agree to submit only the liability 
or damages phase of any one claim); Michaels v. Mariforum 
Shipping, S.A., 624 F.2d 411, 414 (2d Cir. 1980) (finding that 
under the FAA, a district court generally only has the power to 
confirm or vacate a final arbitration award). UPW provides no 
authority indicating that Hawai# i has applied these exceptions to 
HRS Chapter 658A. 
Even if we were to apply the exception allowing for 
bifurcation, we find that there was no expressed intent or agreement that the issue of arbitrability be bifurcated. Despite 
UPW's assertion that section 15.19 of the CBA
11 provides for 
bifurcating the issue of arbitrability from the rest of the grievance issues, upon our review of the provision, we find that 
it does not so provide. Rather, section 15.19 merely requires 
the Arbitrator to determine the issue of arbitrability of a 
grievance when raised by the Employer; it does not evidence an 
expressed intent or agreement to divide the issue from the rest 
of the grievance. See Providence Journal Co. v. Providence 
Newspaper Guild, 271 F.3d 16, 19 (1st Cir. 2001) (determining that whether a partial award with respect to liability is a final 
11 Section 15.19(b) of the CBA provides: 
In the event the Employer disputes the arbitrability of
a grievance[,] the Arbitrator shall determine whether the
grievance is arbitrable prior to or after hearing the meritsof the grievance. If the Arbitrator decides the grievance isnot arbitrable, the grievance shall be referred back to theparties without decision or recommendation on its merits.

     NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
award under the FAA depends on: (1) whether, and to what extent, 
both parties had expressed an intent to bifurcate, and (2) 
whether the arbitrator and the parties understood the 
determination of liability to be a final award). Moreover, the 
federal cases cited by UPW only indicate that this exception 
applies when the two issues to be bifurcated are liability and 
damages, which is not the case here. See id. (stating that the 
holding in Hart Surgical, Inc. v. Ultracision, Inc., 244 F.3d 231 (1st Cir. 2001), "was limited to cases in which the parties, at 
the arbitration stage, had formally agreed to bifurcate 
arbitration into liability and damages phases," but that its 
analysis extends to cases where there is evidence of the parties' 
intent to bifurcate without a formal agreement (emphasis 
omitted)). 
Despite UPW's argument that federal law permits an 
arbitrator's intermediate decision on a separate and independent 
claim to be confirmed, and that the commentary to section 18 of 
the 2000 Revised Uniform Arbitration Act (RUAA)
12 indicates an 
intent for those decisions to be confirmable, we find that such a construction of HRS §§ 658A-18
13 and 658A-22 would be contrary to 
the purpose behind this state's arbitration statute. Lingle, 107 
Hawai i # at 183, 111 P.3d at 592 ("[O]ur foremost obligation is to 
ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature, 
12 RUAA § 18 cmt. 1 provides, in relevant part: "Because the orders of
arbitrators are not self-enforcing, a party who receives a favorable ruling with
which another party refuses to comply, must apply to a court to have the rulingmade an enforceable order." 
13 HRS § 658A-18 (2016) provides: 
[§658A-18] Judicial enforcement of pre-award ruling by

favor of a party to the arbitration proceeding, the party mayrequest the arbitrator to incorporate the ruling into an awardunder section 658A-19. A prevailing party may make a motionto the court for an expedited order to confirm the award undersection 658A-22, in which case the court shall summarilydecide the motion. The court shall issue an order to confirm the award unless the court vacates, modifies, or corrects theaward under section 658A-23 or 658A-24.

necessitating additional and piecemeal litigation, and increasing 
court involvement and expenses in the arbitration process. 
The federal cases cited by UPW, for the proposition 
that intermediate decisions on separate and independent claims 
are confirmable, conclude that the intermediate decisions or 
orders were also final awards or partial final awards subject to 
appeal. See, e.g., Zeiler v. Deitsch, 500 F.3d 157, 168-69 (2d 
Cir. 2007) (reviewing district court's confirmation of eight orders requiring accounting and transfer of documents, and 
concluding that they were final orders, even though they did not 
dispose of all the claims that were submitted to arbitration); 
Publicis Commc'n v. True N. Commc'ns, Inc., 206 F.3d 725, 729 
(7th Cir. 2000) (reviewing district court confirmation of an 
order to turn over tax records and determining that it was a 
final order ripe for confirmation, even though other claims 
remained to be addressed in arbitration); Yasuda Fire & Marine 
Ins. Co. of Europe, Ltd v. Cont'l Cas. Co., 37 F.3d 345, 348-49 
(7th Cir. 1994) (holding that an arbitrator's order of interim 
relief was an "award" subject to both confirmation and vacation 
under the FAA and since the district court ruled on all issues 
pertaining to the order, it was reviewable by the appellate 
court). These federal appellate court holdings are inconsistent 
with our holding in United Public Workers, AFSCME, Local 646, 
AFL-CIO that only a final arbitration award and not merely any 
arbitration intermediate decision could be appealed, and our 
citation to International Shipping Agency, Inc. v. Union 
Empleados de Muelles de Puerto Rico, AFL–CIO, Local 1901, ILA, 
547 F. Supp. 2d 116 (D.P.R. 2008), for the proposition that to be 
considered final, an arbitration award must be intended by the 
arbitrator to be a complete determination of every issue 
submitted. United Pub. Workers, AFSCME, Local 646, AFL-CIO, 124 
Hawai# i at 370-71, 244 P.3d at 607-08. Therefore, we decline to

pari materia16 with our interpretation of HRS § 658A-28(a)(3) in 
United Public Workers, AFSCME, Local 646, AFL-CIO, 124 Hawai# i at 
370, 244 P.3d at 607, we conclude that "award" as used in HRS 
§ 658A-22 means the arbitrator's final award and not simply an 
intermediate decision. This interpretation is consistent with 
the policy behind this state's arbitration statute, see Lingle, 
107 
Hawai# i at 183, 111 P.3d at 592, and produces a harmonious 
result between the sections of HRS Chapter 658A. See Kauai 
Springs, Inc. v. Planning Comm'n of Cty. of Kaua# i, 133 Hawai# i 
141, 163, 324 P.3d 951, 973 (2014) ("It is fundamental in statutory construction that each part or section of a statute 
should be construed in connection with every other part or 
section so as to produce a harmonious whole." (internal quotation 
marks and citation omitted)). 
The circuit court did not err in concluding that the 
Decision on Arbitrability did not constitute an "award" subject 
to confirmation under HRS § 658A-22, and thereby denying the 
First Motion to Confirm. 
B. The circuit court did not err in denying UPW's Second Motion
to Confirm, as it pertained to confirming the Decision onArbitrability as a separate award. 
UPW asserts that the circuit court was required to 
confirm the Decision on Arbitrability when it ruled on the Second 
Motion to Confirm because HRS § 658A-22 leaves no discretion to 
the circuit court where the award was not vacated or modified. 
HRS § 658A-18 provides: 
[§658A-18] Judicial enforcement of pre-award ruling by
arbitrator.  If an arbitrator makes a pre-award ruling in
favor of a party to the arbitration proceeding, the party
may request the arbitrator to incorporate the ruling into anaward under section 658A-19. A prevailing party may make amotion to the court for an expedited order to confirm the 
16 One of the canons of statutory constructions is that "laws in pari 
materia , or upon the same subject matter, shall be construed with reference to
each other. What is clear in one statute may be called upon in aid to explain
what is doubtful in another." Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Omiya , 142 Hawai #i 439,
450
, 420 P.3d 370, 381 (2018) (internal quotation marks, brackets, and citations
omitted); see HR
S § 1-16.

award under section 658A-22, in which case the court shall
summarily decide the motion. The court shall issue an order to confirm the award unless the court vacates, modifies, orcorrects the award under section 658A-23 or 658A-24. 
Here, UPW requested in its post-trial brief that the 
Arbitrator incorporate the Decision on Arbitrability into the 
Decision and Award and the Arbitrator did so. After UPW filed 
its Second Motion to Confirm, the circuit court issued its Order 
Partially Granting/Denying UPW's Second Motion to Confirm, 
confirming the Decision and Award. Because the record reflects 
that the circuit court did in fact confirm the Decision on 
Arbitrability, as incorporated into the Decision and Award, 
pursuant to HRS §§ 658A-18 and 658A-22, UPW's contention that the 
circuit court erred is without merit. Insofar as UPW argues that 
the circuit court erred by not confirming the Decision on 
Arbitrability as a separate award under HRS §§ 658A-18 and 658A-
22, UPW has not provided any authorities requiring such and we 
are not aware of any. 
C. The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying
UPW's request for costs related to its Second Motion toConfirm. 
UPW cites Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 
54(d) in contending that "[a]s a general rule a presumption 
exists in favor of awarding costs to a prevailing party which the 
[State] never overcame." Contrary to UPW's assertion, the HRCP 
Rule 54(d) presumption does not apply here because HRS § 658A-
25(b) expressly provides that the granting of costs is within the 
circuit court's discretion. See
 HRCP Rule 54(d)(1) ("Except when 
express provision therefor is made either in a statute or in these rules, costs shall be allowed as of course to the 
prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs[.]"); see 
also Matter of Arbitration Between United Pub. Workers, AFSCME, 
Local 646, AFL-CIO & Dep't of Transp., Highways Div.
, No. CAAP-
17-0000529, 2019 WL 4131309, at *1 (Haw. App. Aug. 30, 2019) (SDO). 
The award of costs pursuant to HRS § 658A-25(b) is 
15 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
discretionary, not mandatory. See HRS § 658A-25(b) ("A court may 
allow reasonable costs of the motion and subsequent judicial 
proceedings." (emphasis added)); Wong v. Takeuchi, 88 Hawai# i 46, 
52, 961 P.2d 611, 617 (1998) ("The award of taxable cost is within the discretion of the trial court and will not be 
disturbed absent a clear abuse of discretion." (internal 
quotation marks and citation omitted)). 
The record reflects that the circuit court denied UPW's 
costs based on its finding that the State was the prevailing 
party in the contested judicial proceeding for UPW's First Motion 
to Confirm. The circuit court further found that the State 
represented that it would forgo seeking costs for that proceeding 
and determined that it was in the interest of equity to deny 
UPW's request for costs related to the Second Motion to Confirm. 
The circuit court's determination was supported by the record and 
was not an abuse of discretion. See Price v. AIG Hawai# i Ins. 
Co., Inc., 107 Hawai# i 106, 110, 111 P.3d 1, 5 (2005) ("The trial 
court abuses its discretion if it bases its ruling on an 
erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of 
the evidence."). 
D. The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying
UPW's request for attorney's fees pursuant to HRS § 658A-25(c). 
"HRS § 658A-25(c) allows a court to award attorney's 
fees incurred in judicial proceedings to confirm an arbitration 
award when a motion to confirm award under HRS § 658A-22 is 
contested." RT Imp., Inc. v. Torres, 139 Hawai# i 445, 451, 393 
P.3d 997, 1003 (2017) (emphasis added); In re Arbitration Between United Pub. Workers, AFSCME, Local 646, AFL-CIO & City & Cty. of 
Honolulu, 119 Hawai# i 201, 209, 194 P.3d 1163, 1171 (App. 2008) 
("Under the plain language of HRS § 658A–25(c) . . . reasonable attorney's fees may only be awarded to a party who prevails in a 
contested judicial proceeding to confirm, vacate, modify, or 
correct an arbitration award." (emphases added)). 
16 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
UPW asserts that it was entitled to attorney's fees for 
its Second Motion to Confirm under HRS § 658A-25(c) because the 
State's opposition to confirming the Decision on Arbitrability as 
a separate award made it a "contested judicial proceeding," and 
UPW was the prevailing party, since the circuit court confirmed 
the Decision and Award. We disagree with UPW's contention. 
In its response to UPW's Second Motion to Confirm, the 
State conceded that it had "no objection to the issuance of an 
order confirming, pursuant to §658A-19 and §658A-22, HRS, 
Arbitrator Sakai's [Decision and Award], which appears to have 
incorporated Arbitrator Sakai's [Decision on Arbitrability] 
within itself." (Emphasis in original.) The record also 
reflects that the State did not move to vacate the award pursuant 
to HRS § 658A-23 or as violating public policy, In re Grievance 
Arbitration Between State Org. of Police Officers, 135 Hawai# i 
456, 465, 353 P.3d 998, 1007 (2015) ("Hawai
#i case law recognizes 
that there is a limited public policy exception to the general 
deference given arbitration awards." (internal quotation marks 
and citation omitted)), nor did it move to modify or correct the 
award pursuant to HRS § 658A-24. Under the plain language of HRS 
§ 658A-22, the circuit court was obligated to confirm the award 
where the State had not contested it by filing a motion to 
vacate, modify, or correct the award. HRS § 658A-22; see 
Arbitration of Bd. of Dirs. of Ass'n of Apartment Owners of 
Tropicana Manor, 73 Haw. 201, 213, 830 P.2d 503, 510 (1992) ("By 
seeking clarification of the unambiguous original award instead 
of moving to vacate, modify, or correct the award pursuant to HRS 
§§ 658–9 and 658–10, or demanding a trial 
de novo pursuant to HRS 
§ 514A–127 in a timely fashion, appellees waived their right to 
any judicial review of the award."); accord Blau v. AIG Hawai# i 
Ins. Co., No. CAAP-11-0000713, 2014 WL 2949437, at *1 (Haw. App. June 30, 2014) (SDO) (finding that "AIG waived its right to

the arbitration award pursuant to HRS § 658A–24 (Supp. 2013), or 
vacate the award pursuant to § 658A–23 (Supp. 2013)" (footnotes 
omitted)). The State's opposition to the Second Motion to 
Confirm was limited to the confirmation of the Decision of 
Arbitrability as a separate award. The State's limited 
opposition did not convert the proceeding into a "contested 
judicial proceeding" as the State had not actually contested the 
confirmation of the award.17 
The circuit court therefore did not abuse its 
discretion in denying UPW's request for attorney's fees.

Based on the foregoing, we affirm the September 22, 
2016 Judgment, the May 6, 2016 Order Denying UPW's First Motion 
to Confirm, and the September 16, 2016 Order Partially 
Granting/Denying UPW's Second Motion to Confirm.
