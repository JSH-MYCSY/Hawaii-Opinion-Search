NO. CAAP-16-0000681
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
DONALD NICOL, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 14-1-1642)

 
ORDER DISMISSING THE APPEAL FOR
 
LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION

 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record on appeal, it appears that
 
this court lacks appellate jurisdiction because there is no
 
"judgment" in the record on appeal as defined in the Hawaii
 Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-11 (2010). Defendant-Appellant
 
Donald Nicol (Appellant) appeals from an "Order Granting in Part
 and Denying in Part [Appellant's] Motion to Dismiss Indictment
 
with Prejudice," filed on September 16, 2016, in the Circuit
 Court of the First Circuit.
 
Appellant purports to appeal pursuant to HRS § 641-11,
 
which provides in pertinent part, "[a]ny party aggrieved by the
 judgment of a circuit court in a criminal matter may appeal to
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
the intermediate appellate court, subject to chapter 602, in the
 
manner and within the time provided by the rules of court. The
 
sentence of the court in a criminal case shall be the judgment." 
HRS § 641-11 (emphasis added).
 
This case was dismissed without prejudice for violation 
of Rule 48 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Penal Procedure and, 
therefore, no sentence has been imposed. 
Therefore, Appellant may not appeal pursuant to 
HRS § 641-11.
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is dismissed for
 
lack of appellate jurisdiction.
