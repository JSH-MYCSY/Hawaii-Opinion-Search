(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Victor Estrada (Estrada) appeals
 
from an Amended Judgment and Notice of Entry of Amended Judgment,
 
entered by the District Court of the Third Circuit, North and
 South Kona Division (District Court), on October 13, 2016.
1 The
 
District Court convicted Estrada of one count of Operating a
 Vehicle While Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), in
 violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1) and/or

 HRS § 291E-61(a) provides in relevant part:
 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle
under the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates
or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle:
 
(1)	 While under the influence of alcohol in an
 
amount sufficient to impair the person's normal
mental faculties or ability to care for the
person and guard against casualty;
 
. . . . 
(3)	 With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two
hundred ten liters of breath[.]

On appeal, Estrada argues that the District Court
 
(1) violated his constitutional right to (a) testify, by engaging 
him in a fatally deficient colloquy that was not a "true exchange" under Tachibana v. State, 79 Hawai
'i 226, 900 P.2d 1293 
(1995), and (b) due process, by denying his motion to continue trial to allow a material witness to testify; and (2) abused its discretion by denying his motions for extensions of time to file the notice of appeal and stay his sentence pending appeal. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Estrada's 
points of error as follows:
A.	 The district court failed to obtain, on the
record, a valid waiver of Estrada's right to
testify.
 
Although the State concedes Estrada's first point of 
error, "appellate courts have an independent duty 'first to 
ascertain that the confession of error is supported by the record and well-founded in law and second to determine that such error is properly preserved and prejudicial.'" State v. Veikoso, 102 
Hawai
'i 219, 221–22, 74 P.3d 575, 577–78 (2003) (quoting State v. 
Hoang, 93 Hawai 'i 333, 336, 3 P.3d 499, 502 (2000)). In other 
words, the State's concession "is not binding upon an appellate court[.]" Hoang, 93 Hawai
'i at 336, 3 P.3d at 502 (quoting 
Territory v. Kogami, 37 Haw. 174, 175 (Terr. 1945)) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
The District Court failed to obtain, on the record, 
Estrada's knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver of his right to testify. See State v. Monteil, 134 Hawai
'i 361, 369, 341 P.3d 
567, 575 (2014) (recognizing Hawai 'i's historically protected 
right to testify and right not to testify while stressing the importance of ensuring that a waiver of one's fundamental right to testify is "intelligent and voluntary"). State v. Pomroy, 132 
Hawai
'i 85, 91, 319 P.3d 1093, 1099 (2014) (the right to testify 
is guaranteed by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution; article I, sections 5, 10, and 14 of the 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawai'i Constitution; and HRS § 801-2 (1993) and highlighting the 
protection of that right by obtaining an on-the-record waiver); 
State v. Staley, 91 Hawai 'i 275, 287, 982 P.2d 904, 916 (1999) 
("A defendant's waiver of a constitutional right must be knowing, intelligent, and voluntary."). The court engaged Estrada in the following colloquy: 
THE COURT: Um, I need to advise you again that you
have a right to testify. If you want to testify no one can
prevent you from testifying. If you choose to testify the
prosecutor can cross-examine you. If you choose not to
testify the Court cannot hold that against you. You
 understand?
 
[Estrada]: Understand.
 
THE COURT: Okay. Thank you.
 
A discussion of matters unrelated to the right to
 
testify ensued, then Estrada's counsel stated:
 
[Estrada's counsel]: You're not gonna testify.
Right?
 
. . . . 
[Estrada's counsel]: So Mr. Estrada who was also
 
placed on our witness list is not going to testify his case.
 
The District Court neglected to advise Estrada that he 
had the right not to testify. See Tachibana, 79 Hawai 'i at 236 
n.7, 900 P.2d at 1303 n.7 (providing the guidelines for court to 
sufficiently advise criminal defendants of their right to testify and to sufficiently obtain an on-the-record waiver of that right in cases where defendant does not testify); Monteil, 134 Hawai
'i 
at 370, 341 P.3d at 576 (the court's advisement must maintain an "even balance" between the defendant's right to testify and the right not to testify); State v. Lewis, 94 Hawai
'i 292, 295, 12 
P.3d 1233, 1236 (2000) (particular caution must be afforded to avoid infringing upon the right not to testify, which is "more fragile" than the right to testify). 
More importantly, the District Court did not obtain 
Estrada's waiver of his right to testify directly from him but through his attorney only. See State v. Hoang, 94 Hawai
'i 271, 
278, 12 P.3d 371, 378 (App. 2000) (a defendant's waiver of his or her right to testify must be obtained directly from the 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
defendant, not "by proxy"). The failure to obtain Estrada's
 
waiver directly from him rendered the waiver invalid.
 
The District Court's error in failing to obtain a valid
 
waiver was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 
The State further argues that the defective Tachibana 
colloquy was harmless because there is no evidence in the record that Estrada's testimony might have cast reasonable doubt in the mind of the fact-finder. However, Estrada is not required to make such a showing. When a Tachibana colloquy is defective, the burden is on the State to show the error was harmless, or the conviction must be vacated. See Tachibana, 79 Hawai
'i at 240, 
900 P.2d at 1307 ("Once a violation of the constitutional right to testify is established, the conviction must be vacated unless the State can prove that the violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt."). The State has not met this burden. 
Based on the record before us, it is unknowable whether 
the State would have established beyond a reasonable doubt that Estrada committed OVUII, had he testified. See Hoang, 94 Hawai
'i 
at 279, 12 P.3d at 379 ("[I]t is inherently difficult, if not impossible, to divine what effect a violation of the defendant's constitutional right to testify had on the outcome of any particular case."). Therefore, we cannot hold that the defective colloquy was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt.
B.	 The District Court Abused its Discretion By
Denying Estrada's Motions for an Extension of Time
To File His Notice of Appeal and For a Stay
Pending Appeal.
 
The District Court abused its discretion when it 
denied, on multiple occasions, an extension of time to Estrada so 
that he could obtain the services of the Public Defender to file his notice of appeal. However, the error was harmless. Hawai
'i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 4(b)(5) allows for an extension of time for good cause shown, when requested within thirty days of the judgment or appealable order. The record reflects that the District Court initially sentenced Estrada on September 1, 2016 to five days imprisonment, a $500 fine, and various assessment, fees, surcharges, a drug abuse assessment/treatment, referred him to drivers' education and took 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
under advisement a drug demand reduction fee. An amended
 
judgment was entered on October 13, 2016 imposing the drug demand
 reduction fee. This substantive amendment of the sentence made
 the judgment final as of October 13, 2016. Thus, Estrada's
 October 14, 2016 notice of appeal filed one day after the final
 judgment was timely, even without an extension of time.
 
The District Court also abused its discretion when it
 
denied Estrada's motions for a stay. An abuse of discretion
 occurs when the court "clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or
 disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the
 substantial detriment of a party litigant." 
State v. Crisostomo ,
 
94 Hawai 'i 282, 287, 12 P.3d 873, 878 (2000) (citations and 
internal quotation marks omitted). HRS § 641-14 (2016) provides,
 in pertinent part,
 
(a) The filing of a notice of appeal or the giving of oral
notice in open court at the time of sentence by the
defendant or the defendant's counsel of intention to take an
 appeal may operate as a stay of execution and may suspend
the operation of any sentence or order of probation, in the
discretion of the trial court. If the court determines that
 a stay of execution is proper, the court shall state the
conditions under which the stay of execution is granted. No
 stay granted on the giving of oral notice shall be operative
beyond the time within which an appeal may be taken;
provided that if an appeal is properly filed, the stay shall
continue in effect as if the stay was based on a filing of
the appeal.
 
On this subject, the Hawai 'i Supreme Court has written, 
[a]lthough stays are discretionary under HRS § 641-14, HRS§ 804-4(a) provides, "The right to bail shall continue afterconviction of a . . . petty misdemeanor[.]" See also HRS 
§ 804-4(b) ("No defendant entitled to bail, . . . shall besubject, without the defendant's written consent, to theoperation of any sentence[] passed upon the defendant, whileany proceedings to procure a review of any action of thetrial court . . . are pending and undetermined, except asprovided in section 641-14(a)[.]"). In State v. Ortiz, weheld, "An accused misdemeanant, petty misdemeanant, or lawviolator on bail is entitled to bail as a matter of rightafter conviction and pending appellate review." 74 Haw. 343, 356, 845 P.2d 547, 553 (1993). Furthermore, pursuantto State v. Miller, 79 Hawai' i 194, 200-01, 900 P.2d 770,
776-77 (1995), once release on bail pending appeal issecured, a trial court is without jurisdiction under thesentence of probation that is the subject of the defendant'sappeal. 
State v. Kiese, 126 Hawai 'i 494, 510, 273 P.3d 1180, 1196 (2012). 
The court went on to hold that, despite the fact that Kiese had
 
served his sentence, the public interest exception to the
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
mootness doctrine applied and ruled that denial of the motion for
 
stay was error. Id.
 Given the foregoing, we need not address Estrada's
 
other point of error.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the October 13,
 
2016 Amended Judgment and Notice of Entry of Amended Judgment,
 entered by the District Court of the Third Circuit, North and
 South Kona is vacated and the case is remanded for a new trial.
