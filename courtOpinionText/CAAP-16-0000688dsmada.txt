APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 15-1-0435)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record in CAAP-16-0000688, it
 
appears that this court lacks appellate jurisdiction over the
 
appeal. Plaintiff-Appellant Christopher Messer (Appellant)
 appeals from the Final Judgment, filed on September 23, 2016, in
 the Circuit Court of the First Circuit. 
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRS § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2015) authorizes appeals
 
from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS
 
§ 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules
 of court." HRS § 641-1(c). Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of 
Civil Procedure (HRCP) requires that "[e]very judgment shall be
 set forth on a separate document." The Supreme Court of Hawai
'i 
has held that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the
 orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been
 entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant
 to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" 
Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright ,
 
76 Hawai 'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). "Thus, based on 
Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it
 resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been
 reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119
 
Hawai
'i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008). 
[I]f a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a
case involving multiple claims or multiple parties,
the judgment (a) must specifically identify the party
or parties for and against whom the judgment is
entered, and (b) must (i) identify the claims for
which it is entered, and (ii) dismiss any claims not
specifically identified[.]
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (emphasis added). 
For example: 'Pursuant to the jury verdict entered on
(date), judgment in the amount of $___ is hereby
entered in favor of Plaintiff X and against Defendant
Y upon counts I through IV of the complaint." . . .
 . If the circuit court intends that claims other than
 those listed in the judgment language should be
dismissed, it must say so: for example, "Defendant Y's
counterclaim is dismissed," or "Judgment upon
Defendant Y's counterclaim is entered in favor of
 Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all other claims,
counterclaims, and cross-claims are dismissed."
 
Id. at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4. When interpreting
 
the requirements for a judgment under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme
 Court of Hawai
'i noted that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its
face all of the issues in the case, the burden of
searching the often voluminous circuit court record to
verify assertions of jurisdiction is cast upon this
court. Neither the parties nor counsel have a right
to cast upon this court the burden of searching a
voluminous record for evidence of finality, . . . and

we should not make such searches necessary by allowing
the parties the option of waiving the requirements of
HRCP [Rule] 58. 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (citation omitted; 
original emphasis). "[A]n appeal from any judgment will be 
dismissed as premature if the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. (original emphasis). 
The September 23, 2016 Final Judgment did not, on its
 
face: identify Appellant's claims and resolve them in favor of
 Bishop Estate and against Appellant; resolve Bishop Estate's
 third-party claims against Goto Construction in favor of and
 against particular parties; identify Goto Construction's
 counterclaim against Bishop Estate or resolve the counterclaim in
 favor of and against particular parties; or dismiss all remaining
 claims, third-party claims, or counterclaims as to all parties.
 
The September 23, 2016 Final Judgment is not a final
 
appealable judgment or order because it does not comply with HRCP
 Rule 58 and Jenkins, and this court lacks appellate jurisdiction
 over the appeal.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is
 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
