STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
KEONI C. PETERS, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
KANE'OHE DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-15-01728)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Ginoza and Chan, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Keoni C. Peters (Peters) appeals
 
from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and
 
Plea/Judgment, filed on August 24, 2016 in the District Court of
 the First Circuit, Kane
'ohe Division (District Court).1 
Peters was convicted of Operating a Vehicle Under the
 
Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii
 Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง291E-61(a)(1) (Supp. 2014).

On appeal, Peters contends there was insufficient
 
evidence to convict him of OVUII. Specifically, he contends that
 
1
 The Honorable Philip M. Doi presided.

 HRS ยง291E-61 Operating a vehicle under the influence of an
intoxicant. (a) A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle under the
influence of an intoxicant if the person operates or assumes actual physical
control of a vehicle:
 (1) While under the influence of alcohol in an amount sufficient to impair
the person's normal mental faculties or ability to care for the person and
guard against casualty[.]
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
there was insufficient evidence to prove that he was impaired by
 
alcohol to the extent necessary to establish the offense.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Peters' point of error as follows:
 
In considering the evidence adduced at trial in the 
strongest light for the prosecution, State v. Matavale, 115 Hawai
'i 149, 157-58, 166 P.3d 322, 330-31 (2007) (citation 
omitted), we conclude that there was substantial evidence to support Peters' conviction for OVUII. Any lay witness, including a police officer, may testify about his or her observations and provide an opinion about sobriety. State v. Ferrer, 95 Hawai
'i 
409, 429, 23 P.3d 744, 764 (App. 2001) (citing State v. Toyomura, 80 Hawai
'i 8, 26-27, 904 P.2d 893, 911-12 (1995). 
Sergeant Robert Beatty (Sergeant Beatty) testified he
 
observed that a vehicle Peters was operating was speeding and
 weaving back and forth on Kamehameha Highway, which is a public
 road, street, or highway. Peters repeatedly crossed a double
 solid yellow line on the driver's side and crossed a broken white
 line on the passenger's side for half a mile. When Sergeant
 Beatty turned on his lights to pull Peters over, Peters stopped
 quickly and turned right into Kaneohe Bay Shopping Center,
 without any warning, from the second lane. As a result of the
 abrupt turn by Peters, Sergeant Beatty testified he had to hit
 the brakes to avoid hitting the back of the vehicle Peters was
 driving. After stopping Peters, Sergeant Beatty detected a very
 strong odor of an alcoholic beverage on Peters' breath and
 noticed Peters had very bloodshot and glassy eyes and that his
 speech was slurred. Based on his experience of nearly a thousand
 DUI investigations, he believed Peters was intoxicated.
 
We conclude the foregoing, taken together, is
 
substantial evidence to show that Peters was under the influence
 of alcohol in an amount sufficient to impair his normal mental
 faculties or ability to care for the person and guard against
 casualty.
