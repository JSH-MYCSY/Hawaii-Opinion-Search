APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 13-1-0166)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
Defendants-Appellants Paul Hugo Gantt and Edna Gantt
(together, the Gantts) appeal from the October 4, 2016 "Order
Denying Defendants/Third-Party Plaintiffs Paul Hugo Gantt and
Edna Gantt's HRCP Rule 60(b) Motion for Relief from the (1)
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Order Granting [Plaintiff-
Appellee PennyMac Corp.'s ( PennyMac)] Motion for Summary Judgment
Against All Parties and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure"NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(Order Denying Relief ) entered by the Circuit Court of the Fifth
Circuit (Circuit Court ).1 
In their points of error on appeal, the Gantts argue,
on various grounds, that the Circuit Court erred by denying their
May 18, 2016 HRCP Rule 60(b) Motion for Relief from the (1)
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Order Granting Plaintiff's
Motion for Summary Judgment Against All Parties and for
Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure Filed December 29, 2014,
Filed April 1, 2015, and (2) Judgment, filed April 1, 2015
(Motion for Relief ).
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, as well as the
relevant statutory and case law, we resolve the Gantts' points of
error as follows: 
On April 1, 2015, the Circuit Court entered a Judgment
in favor of PennyMac and against the Gantts ( Judgment) pursuant
to the Circuit Court's April 1, 2015 Findings of Fact,
Conclusions of Law, Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary
Judgment Against All Parties and for Interlocutory Decree of
Foreclosure (Foreclosure Decree ).  The Gantts did not timely
appeal from the Judgment on the Foreclosure Decree.  On May 18,
2016, the Gantts filed the Motion for Relief, seeking to set
aside the Foreclosure Decree and Judgment, pursuant to Hawai #i
1The Honorable Kathleen N.A. Watanabe presided.
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Rules of Civil Procedure ( HRCP) Rule 60(b)(4) and (6).2  On
October 4, 2016, the Circuit Court entered its Order Denying
Relief and the Gantts timely filed a notice of appeal therefrom.
The Gantts argue that the Foreclosure Decree and
Judgment are void and unenforceable under HRCP Rule 60(b)(4)
because (1) PennyMac purportedly lacked standing to foreclose on
the subject mortgage and (2) the subject note and mortgage
allegedly are void under Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) Chapter
480 due to unfair and deceptive lending practices.  
"[A] judgment is void only if the court that rendered
it lacked jurisdiction of either the subject matter or the
parties or otherwise acted in a manner inconsistent with due
process of law."  Cvitanovich-Dubie v. Dubie , 125 Hawai #i 128,
139, 254 P.3d 439, 450 (2011) (citation omitted).  This court has
further explained:
Determining whether a judgment is void is not a matter
of discretion under HRCP Rule 60(b)(4).  "In the sound
interest of finality, the concept of void judgment must be
narrowly restricted."  Accordingly, "if a court has the
general power to adjudicate the issues in the class of suits
to which the case belongs then its interim orders and final
judgments, whether right or wrong, are not subject to
collateral attack, so far as jurisdiction over the subject
matter is concerned."
Dillingham Inv. Corp. v. Kunio Yokoyama Tr., 8 Haw. App. 226,
233–34, 797 P.2d 1316, 1319–20 (1990) (citations omitted). 
2HRCP Rule 60 provides, in relevant part:
 
Rule 60.  RELIEF FROM JUDGMENT OR ORDER.
. . . .
(b) Mistakes; Inadvertence; Excusable Neglect; Newly
Discovered Evidence; Fraud, etc.   On motion and upon such
terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or a
party's legal representative from a final judgment, order,
or proceeding for the following reasons: . . . (4) the
judgment is void; . . . or (6) any other reason justifying
relief from the operation of the judgment.
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Here, there is no challenge based on personal
jurisdiction or on due process grounds.  The argument that a
party lacks standing is not equivalent to challenging a court's
subject matter jurisdiction for the purposes of HRCP Rule
60(b)(4).  Cf. Mortg. Elec. Registration Sys., Inc. v. Wise, 130
Hawai#i 11, 17-18, 304 P.3d 1192, 1198-99 (2013) (holding that in
an appeal from an order confirming the foreclosure sale,
mortgagors were precluded from challenging the nominee's standing
to bring foreclosure action).3   
Likewise, an argument that a note and mortgage are void
and unenforceable under HRS § 480-124 does not implicate the
trial court's jurisdiction.  Citicorp Mortg., Inc. v. Bartolome,
94 Hawai# i 422, 434, 16 P.3d 827, 839 (App. 2000) (holding that
"[a] determination under [HRS chapter 480 and federal lending
laws] that the note and mortgage were void and unenforceable, as
Appellants urge, would not oust personal or subject matter
jurisdiction" in the context of HRCP Rule 60(b)(4)).  Rather,
this foreclosure action is "'in the class of suits' that the
[circuit] court 'has the general power to adjudicate.'" 
Cvitanovich-Dubie, 125 Hawai# i at 142, 254 P.3d at 453 (citation
omitted).  Thus, we reject the Gantts' argument that the Circuit
3This court reached the same conclusion in Nationstar Mortg. LLC v.
Akepa Properties LLC, CAAP-15-0000407, 2017 WL 1401468 at *2-3 (App. April 19,
2017) (SDO) (stating, "lack of standing does not render a court's ruling void
under HRCP Rule 60(b)(4)" and "an argument that a party lacks standing is not
equivalent to challenging a court's subject matter jurisdiction"). 
4HRS § 480-12 (2008) provides in relevant part,
§ 480-12 Contracts void.   Any contract or agreement in
violation of this chapter is void and is not enforceable at
law or in equity.

Court erred in denying HRCP Rule 60(b)(4) relief on these
grounds.5 
In addition, the Gantts argue that they are entitled to
relief under HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) because their former counsel
untimely filed their February 18, 2015 memorandum in opposition
to PennyMac's Motion for Summary Judgment.  However, "a party
seeking relief under HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) after the time for appeal
has run 'must establish the existence of "extraordinary
circumstances" that prevented or rendered him unable to prosecute
an appeal.'"  Bartolome , 94 Hawai #i at 436, 16 P.3d at 841
(citation omitted).  
Here, the Gantts do not identify any circumstances that
prevented them from timely appealing from the Foreclosure Decree
and Judgment, let alone extraordinary ones.  The Gantts do not
explain how the late filing of their memorandum in opposition to
the Motion for Summary Judgment relates to their failure to
appeal from the Judgment on the Foreclosure Decree.  Indeed, it
appears that the subject memorandum in opposition was filed one
day late, but that the Circuit Court nevertheless took the
arguments and evidentiary submissions therein into account.  The
minutes from the February 25, 2015 hearing on the Motion for
5We further conclude that raising these issues in the Motion for
Relief was an improper attempt to relitigate the merits of the foreclosure
proceedings which is precluded by the doctrine of res judicata .  Wise, 130

Summary Judgment read in pertinent part, "Court admonished
[defense counsel] as to his late filed opposition but noted that
it will not strike his pleading."  The Gantts provided no
transcript of the hearing on the Motion for Summary Judgment or
failed to otherwise establish that counsel's error was so
detrimental as to constitute an extreme aggravation warranting
extraordinary relief under HRCP Rule 60(b)(6).
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's October 4, 2016
Order Denying Relief is affirmed.
