the fees or an order authorizing Appellant to proceed on appeal
 
in forma pauperis, the matter would be called to the court's
 attention on January 16, 2017, for action that may include
 dismissal, and Appellant may file a motion requesting relief from
 default;
 
(5) Appellant did not pay the filing fees, or take any
 
further action in this appeal; and
 
(6) An appeal may be dismissed where the record on
 
appeal has not been prepared because the appellant failed to pay

 proceed in forma pauperis. HRAP Rule 11(b)(2) & (c)(2).
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed.
