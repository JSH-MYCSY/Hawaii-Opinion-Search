On appeal, Joseph argues that the District Court
 
wrongly convicted her (1) after violating her constitutional
 right to testify in her own defense by engaging her in a
 deficient colloquy under Tachibana v. State, 79 Hawai

P.2d 1293 (1995) and failing to conduct a "true colloquy" with
 her; (2) after burdening her constitutional rights to due process

equivalent to a driver's license issued in this State but

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Joseph's
 first and third points of error as follows. 
A.	 The Tachibana colloquy
 
1.	 The Tachibana colloquy was deficient, and
there was no "true colloquy."
 
The District Court engaged Joseph in the following
 
colloquy on the subject of her right to testify:
 
THE COURT: . . . .
 
. . . . 
And, Ms. Joseph, you have a right to testify. If you
want to testify no one can prevent you from testifying. If
 
you choose to testify the prosecutor can cross-examine you.
If you choose not to testify the Court cannot hold that
against you. You understand?
 
[Joseph] (Interpreted): Yes.
 
THE COURT: Okay.
 (The defendant and counsel held a discussion off the
record through the interpreter.)
 
[Joseph's counsel]: And, uh, Your Honor, Miss, um,
Joseph indicated to me she does not wish to testify.
 
THE COURT: Okay.
 
The State concedes that the colloquy was deficient 
under Tachibana because the District Court accepted waiver of the 
right to testify from Joseph's counsel rather than directly from Joseph. Nevertheless, "appellate courts have an independent duty 'first to ascertain that the confession of error is supported by the record and well-founded in law and second to determine that such error is properly preserved and prejudicial.'" State v. 
Veikoso, 102 Hawai
'i 219, 221–22, 74 P.3d 575, 577–78 (2003) 
(quoting State v. Hoang, 93 Hawai 'i 333, 336, 3 P.3d 499, 502 
(2000)). In other words, the State's confession of error "is not 
3
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
binding upon an appellate court[.]" Hoang, 93 Hawai 'i at 336, 3 
P.3d at 502 (quoting Territory v. Kogami, 37 Haw. 174, 175 (Terr. 
1945)) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
The District Court did not engage in a "true colloquy" 
where it merely recited a "litany of rights" followed by a single inquiry as to whether Joseph understood. See State v. Pomroy, 
132 Hawai
'i 85, 89, 91, 93 n.7, 319 P.3d 1093, 1097, 1099, 1101 
n.7 (2014). Joseph's need to communicate at trial through a translator was a "salient fact" that made the court's failure to engage in a "true colloquy" even more significant. See State v. 
Han, 130 Hawai
'i 83, 92, 306 P.3d 128 (2013). 
Furthermore, Joseph never directly indicated to the 
court whether she would testify; rather, she answered through her counsel. See State v. Hoang, 94 Hawai
'i 271, 278, 12 P.3d 371, 
378 (App. 2000) (stating that a defendant's waiver of his or her right to testify must be obtained directly from the defendant, not "by proxy "); State v. Staley, 91 Hawai
'i 275, 286-87, 962 
P.2d 904, 915-16 (1999) (holding that an on-the-record waiver of the right to testify must be elicited from the defendant). Therefore, the Tachibana colloquy in this case was deficient as a matter of law. 
2.	 The State did not meet its burden, under
Tachibana, to show the defective colloquy was
harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 
In Tachibana, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court held: 
Once a violation of the constitutional right to
testify is established, the conviction must be vacated
unless the State can prove that the violation was harmless
beyond a reasonable doubt. [State v. ]Silva, 78 Hawai' i 
[115, ]125, 890 P.2d [702, ]712 [(App. 1995)] ("The harmless
beyond a reasonable doubt rule would apply to constitutional
error involving the right to testify[.]"); see also LaVigne [v. State], 812 P.2d [217, ]221 [(Alaska, 1991)] (holding
that once defendant establishes that counsel prevented him
from testifying and that he would have offered relevant
testimony, reversal is required unless State can show that
the failure to testify was harmless beyond a reasonable
doubt). 
79 Hawai 'i at 240, 900 P.2d at 1307. 
Here, Joseph argues that the defective 
Tachibana
 
colloquy was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because
 
without an indication of what she would have testified to on the
 
4
    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
stand, it is unknowable whether the State would have shown beyond
 
a reasonable doubt she committed the offense, had she testified.
 The State responds that notwithstanding the standard of review
 according to Tachibana, Joseph initially has the burden to show
 that there is a reasonable possibility that the error contributed
 to her conviction, i.e., that she would have offered relevant
 testimony had she testified. 
The State contends that in Tachibana, the Hawai 'i 
Supreme Court erroneously cited to Silva4 as support for its 
holding because Silva concerned whether the trial court committed harmless error, under Rule 52(a) of the Hawai
'i Rules of Penal 
Procedure ("HRPP"), whereas the issue in Tachibana was whether the trial court committed plain error, under HRPP Rule 52(b). Alternatively, the State argues that in Tachibana, the supreme court did not erroneously apply Silva, but instead, "intended it only as a precedent for a special application of Plain Error review subject to modifications consistent with La Vigne[,]"
5 
which the supreme court also cited to in Tachibana as a basis for its holding. In other words, the State continues, 
if Tachibana meant to impose the Plain Error second-step
 
4/
 In Silva, this court held that a trial court's intervention in
Silva's exercise of his right to testify or not testify was not harmless,
under HRPP Rule 52(a). 78 Hawai' i at 125-26, 890 P.2d at 712-13. 
5/
 In La Vigne, 812 P.2d at 220, the Supreme Court of Alaska
addressed whether a trial court's violation of La Vigne's right to testify
compelled a per se reversal of his conviction, as La Vigne argued, or
affirmance unless La Vigne showed he was prejudiced, as the prosecution
argued. La Vigne did not raise the issue below. The Alaska Supreme Court
held that the applicable standard of review was whether the constitutional
violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Id.
 
The Alaska Supreme Court explained that application of the
harmless-beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard involved a two-step, burden-
shifting process:
 
First, after showing that his constitutional right to
testify has been denied, La Vigne bears an initial burden to
show he would have offered relevant testimony had he been
allowed to testify at his trial. . . . 
. . . . 
If the defendant's initial burden is met, the burden
will then shift to the state to show that denial of his
 
constitutional right was harmless error beyond a reasonable
doubt. . . .
 
Id. at 2220-21.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
burden on the state in cases denying the right to testify,
it surely meant to do so only after a defendant has met
their initial burden under La Vigne to show that defendant
 
would have offered relevant testimony had defendant been
allowed to testify at his trial or at least now.
 
Citing to State v. Taylor, 130 Hawai 'i 196, 205, 307 P.3d 1142, 
1151 (2013),6
 the State refers to this special form of review as
a "two-step plain-error-then-harmless-error" review. 
In 
Tachibana, the Hawai 'i Supreme Court plainly held 
that where the colloquy on the right to testify is defective, on 
appeal, the State bears the initial burden to show that the error is harmless. Here, the State urges this court to read into this holding a precondition that the defendant show he or she would have offered relevant testimony had he or she testified. However, Tachibana, on its face, includes no such precondition. Tachibana has not been overruled and remains binding on this court. See State v. Jim, 105 Hawai
'i 319, 331, 97 P.3d 395, 407 
(App. 2004) ("[u]nder the doctrine of stare decisis, where a legal principle has been passed upon by the court of last resort, it is the duty of all inferior tribunals to adhere to the decision, until the decision has been reversed or overruled by the court of last resort or altered by legislative enactment." (quoting Soderlund v. Admin. Dir. of Courts, 96 Hawai
'i 114, 119 
n.8, 26 P.3d 1214, 1219 n.8 (2001)) (original brackets, ellipsis, and internal quotation marks omitted)). 
The State argues in the alternative that even if the
 
State has the initial burden to show a defective colloquy was
 harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, under Tachibana, the State
 has met its burden given the overwhelming evidence that Joseph

 In Taylor, where Taylor argued for the first time on appeal that
the trial court failed to provide a particular jury instruction sua sponte,
the Hawai' i Supreme Court explained that the following standard of review
applied: 
This court may notice as plain error the omission of a
mistake of fact jury instruction if it appears that the
defendant has come forward with credible evidence going to
the defense that the jury should have been able to consider.
. . . . In such an instance, where the omission of the
mistake of fact jury instruction constitutes plain error, it
shall be a basis for reversal of the defendant's conviction
 only if an examination of the record as a whole reveals that
the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
 
130 Hawaii at 207-08, 307 P.3d at 1153-54 (footnote and citation omitted).

committed DWOL. The State asserts that no testimony by Joseph 
would have overcome Hawai 'i County Police Sergeant Bradley 
Freitas's credible testimony that Joseph produced no driver's license and said she had none. The State notes that Joseph has never produced or claimed to have in her possession a valid driver's license. 
We cannot hold that the defective colloquy was harmless 
beyond a reasonable doubt. See Tachibana, 79 Hawai
'i at 240, 900 
P.2d at 1307 ("Once a violation of the constitutional right to testify is established, the conviction must be vacated unless the State can prove that the violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt." (citing Silva, 78 Hawai
'i at 125, 890 P.2d at 
712)); Hoang, 94 Hawai 'i at 279, 12 P.3d at 379 ("[I]t is 
inherently difficult, if not impossible, to divine what effect a violation of the defendant's constitutional right to testify had on the outcome of any particular case." (citing Silva, 94 Hawai
'i 
at 126, 890 P.2d at 713)). The record does not indicate what Joseph would have said had she testified. Thus, it is unknowable what the district court's determinations regarding the weight of the evidence and credibility of the witnesses would have been, had she testified. See Pomroy, 132 Hawai
'i at 94, 319 P.3d at 
1102. 
B.	 The evidence that Joseph committed DWOL is
sufficient.
 
Joseph argues that there was insufficient evidence that 
she committed DWOL because the State failed to show she did not 
possess a driver's license from another jurisdiction and, thus, was not exempt under HRS section 286-105. The State adduced sufficient evidence that Joseph committed DWOL, and an exemption under HRS section 286-105 is a defense, which Joseph had the initial burden to assert. See State v. Castillon, 140 Hawai
'i 
242, 247, 398 P.3d 831, 836 (App. 2017) (holding that the HRS section 286-102(a) exceptions are not elements of the DWOL offense, but are defenses for which the defendant must first offer evidence before the burden shifts to the prosecution to disprove). Because Joseph has offered no evidence that she 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
qualified for any of the exemptions under HRS section 286-105,
 
her insufficiency claim lacks merit.
 
Given the foregoing, we need not address Joseph's
 
second point of error.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment and
 
Notice of Entry of Judgment, entered by the District Court of the
 Third Circuit on August 30, 2016, is vacated and the case is
 remanded for a new trial.
