ORDER
 
(1)
 GRANTING DECEMBER 12, 2016 MOTION TO DISMISS APPELLATE COURT
CASE NUMBER CAAP-16-0000722 FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION,
(2) STRIKING DECEMBER 22, 2016 REPLY MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF
APPELLATE PROCEDURE RULE 27

 
AND
 
(3) DISMISSING ALL PENDING MOTIONS AS MOOT
 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) Plaintiff-Appellee Federal National
 
Mortgage Association's (Appellee Federal National Mortgage
 
Association) December 12, 2016 motion to dismiss appellate court
 case number CAAP-16-0000722 for lack of appellate jurisdiction,
 (2) Defendant-Appellant John-Michael Kaio's (Appellant John-
Michael Kaio) December 19, 2016 memorandum in opposition to
 Appellee Federal National Mortgage Association's December 12,
 2016 motion to dismiss, (3) Appellee Federal National Mortgage
 Association's December 22, 2016 reply memorandum in support of
 its December 12, 2016 motion to dismiss, and (4) the record, it
 appears that Rule 27 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
(HRAP) does not authorize Appellee Federal National Mortgage
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Association's December 22, 2016 reply memorandum and, thus, we do
 
not consider the reply memorandum in our adjudication of Appellee
 Federal National Mortgage Association's December 12, 2016 motion
 to dismiss. It further appears that we lack appellate
 jurisdiction over Appellant John-Michael Kaio's appeal from the
 Honorable Bert I. Ayabe's September 14, 2016 interlocutory order
 denying Appellant John-Michael Kaio's motion to dismiss the
 underlying foreclosure case in Civil No. 12-1-1054 (BIA), because
 the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit court) has not
 yet entered a separate final judgment.
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (2016) 
authorizes appeals to the Hawai
'i Intermediate Court of Appeals 
from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of 
Civil Procedure (HRCP) requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." Based on this requirement under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has held that 
"[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 
115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). "Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai
'i 245, 
254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008). Consequently, "[a]n appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 
(footnote omitted). 
On November 30, 2016, the circuit court clerk filed the
 
record on appeal for appellate court case number CAAP-16-0000722,
 which does not include a final judgment. Although exceptions to
 the final judgment requirement exist under the doctrine in Forgay
 v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848) (the Forgay doctrine), the
 collateral order doctrine, and HRS § 641-1(b) (2016), the
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
September 14, 2016 interlocutory order does not satisfy the 
requirements for appealability under any of those exceptions. See Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai
'i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 
(1995) (regarding the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai
'i 319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding the 
three requirements for the collateral order doctrine); HRS § 641­1(b) (regarding the requirements for an appeal from an interlocutory order). Absent an appealable final judgment, we lack appellate jurisdiction over appellate court case number CAAP-16-0000722 and Appellant John-Michael Kaio's appeal is premature. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellee Federal
 
National Mortgage Association's December 12, 2016 motion to
 dismiss is granted, and appellate court case number CAAP-16­0000722 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that Appellee Federal
 
National Mortgage Association's December 22, 2016 reply
 memorandum in support of its December 12, 2016 motion is stricken
 as unauthorized under HRAP Rule 27.
 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions
 
in appellate court case number CAAP-16-0000722 are dismissed as
 moot.
