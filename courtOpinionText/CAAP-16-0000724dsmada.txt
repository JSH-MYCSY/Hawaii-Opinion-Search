EY, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
DY, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 
(FC-D NO. 07-1-0098)

 
ORDER DISMISSING APRIL 18, 2017 MOTION TO RESURRECT AND
REACTIVATE APPELLATE COURT CASE NUMBER CAAP-16-0000725 AND
 
CONSOLIDATE INTO APPELLATE COURT CASE NUMBER CAAP-16-0000724
 
(Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1)the January 12, 2017 order dismissing

 
appellate court case number CAAP-16-0000725 for lack of appellate
 
jurisdiction, (2) Defendant-Appellant DY's (Appellant DY)
 April 18, 2017 motion to resurrect and reactivate appellate court
 case number CAAP-16-0000725 and consolidate into appellate court
 case number CAAP-16-0000724, (3) the April 19, 2017 order
 dismissing appellate court case number CAAP-16-0000724 for lack
 of appellate jurisdiction, and (4) the record, it appears that
 Appellant DY filed the April 18, 2017 motion in appellate court
 case number CAAP-16-0000724 for the purpose of requesting relief
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
from the dismissal of appellate court case number CAAP-16­
0000725. We no longer have appellate jurisdiction over appellate court case number CAAP-16-0000725. As we have already dismissed appellate court case numbers CAAP-16-0000724 and CAAP-16-0000725 for lack of appellate jurisdiction, Appellant DY's request to consolidate these two appellate cases is now moot. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellant DY's
 
April 18, 2017 motion to resurrect and reactivate appellate court
 case number CAAP-16-0000725 and consolidate into appellate court
 case number CAAP-16-0000724 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
