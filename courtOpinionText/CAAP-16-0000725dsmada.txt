DAVID YUKIMURA, Defendant-Appellant 

APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRTH CIRCUIT

ORDER
 
DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
AND
 
DISMISSING AS MOOT ALL PENDING MOTIONS IN CAAP-16-0000725
 
(Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record in this appeal arising out of
 
post-judgment proceedings in a divorce case, it appears that we
 
lack appellate jurisdiction over Defendant-Appellant John Doe's
 (Appellant Husband) appeal from the Honorable Edmund D. Acoba's
 April 29, 2016 post-judgment "Order Regarding Defendant's Motion
 to Show Cause Filed April 27, 2015; Supplement to Defendant's
 Motion to Show Cause Filed May 12, 2015; Plaintiff's Motion and
 Affidavit for Order to Show Cause and Relief after Order and
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Decree Filed May 21, 2015; Plaintiff's Supplemental Motion and 
Affdavit [sic] for Order to Show Cause and Relief after Order and Decree Filed June 19, 2015; Plaintiff's Motion to Enforce Agreement Filed October 21, 2015; and Defendant's Motion to Show Cause and Motion to Enforce Agreement Filed November 9, 2015" (the April 29, 2016 post-judgment order). 
The April 29, 2016 post-judgment order appears to be an 
independently appealable final post-judgment order under Hawaii Revised Statutes § 571-54 (2006). See Hall v. Hall, 96 Hawai
'i 
105, 111 n.4, 26 P.3d 594, 600 n.4 (App. 2001), affirmed in part, and vacated in part on other grounds, Hall v. Hall, 95 Hawai
'i 
318, 22 P.3d 965 (2001); Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 Hawai 'i 153, 157, 
80 P.3d 974, 978 (2003). Nevertheless, Appellant Husband did not file his October 26, 2016 notice of appeal within thirty days after entry of the April 29, 2016 post-judgment order, as Rule 4(a)(1) of the Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 
required for a timely appeal. 
Although Appellant Husband might have attempted to 
invoke the tolling provision in HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) by filing a May 13, 2016 post-judgment motion for reconsideration (May 13, 2016 Motion for Reconsideration) of the April 29, 2016 post-judgment order pursuant to Rule 59 of the Hawai
'i Family Court Rules 
(HFCR), Appellant Husband did not file his May 13, 2016 Motion for Reconsideration within ten days after entry of the April 29, 2016 post-judgment order, as HFCR Rule 59(e) expressly required for a "timely" post-judgment motion for reconsideration that 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
would invoke the tolling provision in HRAP Rule 4(a)(3).1 See
 
HFCR Rule 59(e) ("[A] motion to reconsider, alter or amend a
 
judgment or order is not required but may be filed no later than
 10 days after the entry of the judgment or order[.]"). 
Consequently, Appellant Husband did not invoke the tolling
 provision in HRAP Rule 4(a)(3), and his October 26, 2016 notice
 of appeal is untimely as to the April 29, 2016 post-judgment
 order under HRAP Rule 4(a)(1). The failure to file a timely
 notice of appeal in a civil matter is a jurisdictional defect
 that the parties cannot waive and the appellate courts cannot
 disregard in the exercise of judicial discretion. 
Bacon v.
 
Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP Rule
 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or justice is authorized to change
 
1 Rule 4(a)(3) of the Hawai 'i Rules of Appellate
Procedure  provides: 
(3) Time to appeal affected by post-judgment motions. If any
party files a timely motion for judgment as a matter of law,
to amend findings or make additional findings, for a new
trial, to reconsider, alter or amend the judgment or order,
or for attorney's fees or costs, and court or agency rules
specify the time by which the motion shall be filed, then
the time for filing the notice of appeal is extended for all
parties until 30 days after entry of an order disposing of
the motion. The presiding court or agency in which the
motion was filed shall dispose of any such post-judgment
motion by entering an order upon the record within 90 days
after the date the motion was filed. If the court or agency
fails to enter an order on the record, then, within 5 days
after the 90th day, the clerk of the relevant court or
agency shall notify the parties that, by operation of this
Rule, the post-judgment motion is denied and that any orders
entered thereafter shall be a nullity. The time of appeal
shall run from the date of entry of the court or agency's
order disposing of the post-judgment motion, if the order is
entered within the 90 days, or from the filing date of the
clerk's notice to the parties that the post-judgment motion
is denied pursuant to the operation of the Rule.
The notice of appeal shall be deemed to appeal the
disposition of all post-judgment motions that are timely
filed after entry of the judgment or order.
The 90-day period shall be computed as provided in Rule 26
of these Rules.

rules."); HRAP Rule 26(e) ("The reviewing court for good cause
 shown may relieve a party from a default occasioned by any
 failure to comply with these rules, except the failure to give
 timely notice of appeal."). 
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
