IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
DAVID HAILI KAAWA, IV., Petitioner-Appellant, v.
 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent-Appellee
 
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
 
(S.P.P. 
NO. 15-1-007K; CR. NO. 11-1-277K)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
appellate jurisdiction over Plaintiff-Appellant David H. 
Kaawa, IV's (Appellant Kaawa) appeal in appellate court case number CAAP-16-0000737 from the ongoing circuit court proceedings in S.P.P. No. 15-1-007K, the Honorable Ronald Ibarra presiding, because the circuit court has not yet entered a final judgment or final order pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-11 (2016), Rule 40(h) of the Hawai
'i Rules of Penal Procedure 
(HRPP), and the holding in Grattafiori v. State,  79 Hawai 'i 10, 
13, 897 P.2d 937, 940 (1995). see

"The right of appeal in a criminal case is purely 
statutory and exists only when given by some constitutional or 
statutory provision." State v. Poohina, 97 Hawai 'i 505, 509, 40 
P.3d 907, 911 (2002) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Pursuant to HRS § 641-11 (2016) and "HRPP [Rule] 40(h), appeals from proceedings for post-conviction relief may be made from a judgment entered in the proceeding and must be taken in accordance with Rule 4(b) of the Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP)." Grattafiori v. State, 79 Hawai 'i at 13, 897 
P.2d at 940 (1995) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). Nevertheless, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has 
specifically held that, when a petitioner for post-conviction relief under HRPP Rule 40 files a notice of appeal before the circuit court has announced and entered its final order or final judgment, then "we must conclude that . . . [the] notice of appeal . . . has no legal effect, insofar as there is no jurisdictional basis upon which to file an appeal from an order that has not yet been announced or entered." Id. Under such 
circumstances, the 
notice of appeal constitutes a legal nullity
because, at the time of filing, there was neither
an oral decision nor a written order from which to
 appeal. While we treat an appeal as timely where
a defendant has filed his notice of appeal after
the court has announced an oral decision but
 before the entry of a written order or judgment,
HRAP [Rule] 4(b), we cannot do so where the
court has rendered no decision whatsoever.
 
Id.
 at 14, 897 P.2d at 941 ("Consequently, we are without
 
 
jurisdiction to address the merits of Grattafiori's appeal.").
 
 
In the instant case, the circuit court has not yet

 
entered a final judgment or final order that resolves the issues

that Appellant Kaawa's HRPP Rule 40 petition for post-conviction 
relief raised in S.P.P. No. 15-1-007K. Appellant Kaawa's appeal is premature, and we lack appellate jurisdiction over appellate court case number CAAP-16-0000737. 
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
 
case number CAAP-16-0000737 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction without prejudice to Appellant Kaawa asserting a
 timely appeal from a future final judgment or final order.
