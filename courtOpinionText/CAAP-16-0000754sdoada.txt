 STATE OF HAWAI #I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
GARY VAN ZANDT, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
(FC-CR NO. 15-1-0135)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, and Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Gary Van Zandt appeals from an
"Order of Resentencing Revocation of Probation," issued by the
Family Court of the Second Circuit ("Family Court")1 on
October 21, 2016.  The Family Court revoked Van Zandt's probation
on the stated basis that Van Zandt inexcusably failed to comply
with a substantial requirement of the judgment setting forth the
terms and conditions of his probation.  Van Zandt was resentenced
to one year of incarceration. 
On appeal, Van Zandt argues that the Family Court
wrongly revoked his probation (1) after erroneously placing a
burden on him to show that his failure to comply with a general
term and condition of probation was excusable, rather than
placing the burden on the prosecution to show that the
noncompliance was inexcusable; and (2) based on insufficient
evidence that he failed to comply with the condition that he
obtain a substance-abuse assessment and follow its
recommendations. 
1/The Honorable Richard T. Bissen, Jr. presided.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Van
Zandt's points of error as follows and affirm.
1. The Family Court did not relieve the State of its
burden to show that Van Zandt's failure to comply
with the second general term and condition of his
probation was inexcusable; and the court rightly
concluded that the noncompliance was inexcusable.
Van Zandt argues that the Family Court erred when it
placed a burden on him to show that his failure to comply with
term and condition of probation no. 2 ("General Term and
Condition 2")2 was excusable, rather than placing the burden on
the prosecution to show that it was inexcusable, as required by
Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") section 706-625(3).3  We disagree
that the court relieved the State of its burden of proof.  See
Haw. Rev. Stat. § 706-625(3).
A decision that a probationer's failure to comply with
a probation order was inexcusable is a conclusion of law.  State
v. Lazar , 82 Hawai #i 441, 443, 922 P.2d 1054, 1056 (App. 1996). 
Conclusions of law are reviewable de novo.  State v. Adler, 108
Hawai#i 169, 174, 118 P.3d 652, 657 (2005).  "The court shall
revoke probation if the defendant has inexcusably failed to
comply with a substantial requirement imposed as a condition of
the order or has been convicted of a felony."  Haw. Rev. Stat. §
706-625(3).  The term "inexcusably" in HRS § 706-625(3) means a
wilful and deliberate attempt to circumvent the order of the
court.  State v. Villiarimo, 132 Hawai# i 209, 222, 320 P.3d 874,
887 (2014).
Contrary to Van Zandt's claim, there was sufficient
evidence that he acted intentionally and deliberately attempted
to circumvent the probation order by violating the substantial
2/General Term and Condition 2 provides that, "You must report to a
probation officer as directed by the court or the probation officer[.]"
3/HRS § 706-625(3) (2014) provides, in part, that, "[t]he court
shall revoke probation if the defendant has inexcusably failed to comply with
a substantial requirement imposed as a condition of the order[.]"
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
condition of his probation that he "must report to a probation
officer as directed by the court or the probation officer."  The
Family Court found that the State met its burden by presenting
evidence showing that Van Zandt missed his March 23 and May 12,
2016 appointments with his probation officer and did not provide
an excuse in either instance.  Further, Van Zandt should have
known what general compliance with the terms and conditions of
probation entailed because the court had revoked his probation
for noncompliance with paragraph 7F of the Terms and Conditions
of Probation ("Special Term and Condition F") in September 2015.4 
The prosecution having presented sufficient evidence
that Van Zandt was in noncompliance with the terms of his
probation, the Family Court was well supported in its conclusion
that he inexcusably violated probation.  See Haw. Rev. Stat. §§
706-625(3) and 706–606 (2014) ("Factors to be considered when
imposing a sentence"); State v. Villiarimo , 132 Hawai# i 209, 222,
320 P.3d 874, 887 (2014) (defining "inexcusably" as used in HRS §
706-625(3)); State v. Stocker , 90 Hawai #i 85, 92, 976 P.3d 399,
406 (1999) ("[T]he mind of an alleged offender may be read from
his acts, conduct and inferences fairly drawn from all the
circumstances." (citing State v. Mitsuda , 86 Hawai #i 37, 44, 947
P.2d 349, 356 (1997))).
On May 20, 2015, prior to the March 23 and May 12, 2016
violations of probation, Van Zandt signed the Terms and
Conditions of Probation form indicating that he understood the
terms and conditions of probation and the special terms and
conditions.  Furthermore, he had received a copy of the September
2, 2015 order revoking his probation, as well as a copy of the
Terms and Conditions of Probation.  Moreover, he had been
informed in person that he had a March 23, 2016 appointment with
4/Special Term and Condition F in the prior order provided:
You must make telephone or personal contact with the Family
Peace Center . . . by May 12, 2015 to schedule an intake
interview and begin their Domestic Violence Intervention/Anger
Management Program.  Unless found inappropriate for their
program, you are ordered to participate in the program until
discharged and comply with all the rules of the program as
provided to you in writing.
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
his probation officer, and subsequently was informed by letter
that he had a May 12, 2016 appointment with his probation
officer.  The letter noted that he should call to reschedule if
he could not make the date or time of the appointment. 
Therefore, it was reasonable for the Family Court to infer that
Van Zandt understood what general compliance entailed.  See State
v. Pone, 78 Hawai #i 262, 273, 892 P.2d 455, 466 (1995) (the trier
of fact "may draw all reasonable and legitimate inferences and
deductions from the evidence" (quoting State v. Batson, 73 Haw.
236, 245-46, 831 P.2d 924, 930 (1992))).  See also,  e.g., State
v. Ahina, No. CAAP-13-0006008, 2016 WL 3092870 (Hawai# i App. May
31, 2016) (holding that there was sufficient evidence that
defendant acted and deliberately attempted to circumvent his
probation order); State v. Palencia , No. CAAP-11-0001083, 2013 WL
3776160 (Hawai #i App. July 8, 2013) (ruling that there was
substantial evidence-including evidence of defendant lying, being
late to treatment, lacking motivation to address problems, and
not reporting accurately his medication requirement-to support
the court's conclusion that defendant inexcusably failed to
comply with substantial requirements of his probation).
Van Zandt failed to comply with the requirement that he
report to his probation officer when he did not show up for his
scheduled meeting with Probation Officer Reynilda Stribling on
March 23, 2016, and was late to arrive for his subsequently-
scheduled meeting with Officer Stribling on May 12, 2016
(arriving approximately four hours later, well after Officer
Stribling had gone for the day).  Furthermore, Officer Stribling
was not able to reach Van Zandt at the telephone numbers that he
had previously provided.  Moreover, Officer Stibling confirmed
with Hina Mauka that Van Zandt had stopped calling them.  No
reasons for these failures to report were offered.  Given Van
Zandt's conduct and the inferences fairly drawn from all of the
circumstances, there was sufficient evidence that Van Zandt acted
intentionally and deliberately attempted to circumvent the
probation order by violating a substantial condition of his
probation.  Van Zandt's repeated failures to report circumvented
the probation order, undermined the purposes of his sentence as
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
set out in HRS § 706-606(2)(b), (c), and (d), and negatively
impacted on the goals of his probation.
Van Zandt's reliance on State v. Huggett , 55 Haw. 632,
525 P.2d 1119 (1974), is misplaced.  Huggett is distinguishable,
as the Hawai# i Supreme Court's holding there focused on the
defendant's "mere failure" to keep his probation officer informed
of his whereabouts.  Id. at 637, 525 P.2d at 1123.  Here, in
addition to Van Zandt's failure to respond to telephone calls
from Officer Stribling, Van Zandt failed to attend two
previously-scheduled meetings with Officer Stibling and had
stopped contacting his treatment program despite express
instructions to the contrary.  Furthermore, this case arises in
the context of a second round of violations and a second re-
sentencing.  Based on the evidence and the context in which it
arises, and taking the protective and rehabilitative purposes of
probation into account, there was substantial evidence supporting
the Family Court's finding that Van Zandt inexcusably failed to
report to his probation officer as directed.
2. The Family Court did not clearly err in finding
that Van Zandt violated a special term and
condition of probation.
Van Zandt argues that there was insufficient evidence
that he violated paragraph 7I of the Terms and Conditions of
Probation ("Special Term and Condition I"),5 which required him
to "obtain and maintain substance abuse treatment as directed by
or at the discretion of your probation officer [.]"  (Emphasis
added.)  He maintains that since Hina Mauka's instruction to call
each day was not ordered or adopted by his probation officer, he
did not violate Special Term and Condition I by failing to comply
with the instruction.  We disagree.
The Family Court did not clearly err by finding that
5/Special Term and Condition I provides that:
You must submit to drug/alcohol assessment at your own
expense as directed by your probation officer.  If deemed
necessary, obtain and maintain substance abuse treatment as
directed by or at the discretion of your probation officer
until clinically discharged with the concurrence of your
probation officer.  You shall be responsible for payment of
such treatment.
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
Van Zandt violated Special Term and Condition I.  It is
undisputed that Van Zandt understood the Terms and Conditions of
Probation when his sentence began in May 2015 and he was directed
by his probation officer to obtain and maintain treatment at Hina
Mauka.  However, he did not call Hina Mauka every day, and
therefore failed to follow the treatment center's instruction. 
Following the treatment center's instruction was necessary to
comply with the probation officer's directions to obtain and
maintain substance abuse treatment.
To read Special Term and Condition I as requiring
compliance with the probation officer's, but not Hina Mauka's,
directions would be absurd.  See Lazar , 82 Hawai# i at 442-43, 922
P.2d at 1055-56 (noting that the defendant understood the terms
of his probation, yet made a conscious and willful decision to
fail to comply with a substantial requirement imposed as a
condition of his probation).  Furthermore, it would be
inconsistent with Van Zandt's recent resentencing for exceeding
the number of allowable absences from Domestic Violence
Intervention classes as required by his initial treatment
program.  In that case, Van Zandt admitted that he had
inexcusably failed to comply with a substantial term or condition
of his probation.
Therefore, the "Order of Resentencing Revocation of
Probation," issued by the Family Court of the Second Circuit on
October 21, 2016, is affirmed.
