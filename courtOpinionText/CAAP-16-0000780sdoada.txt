NATHAN PACO, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
MARY K. MYERS, dba MARY K. MYERS, Ph.D.,
dba MARY MYERS, Ph.D., INC., aka
MARY MYERS, TRUST, Defendant-Appellee,
and DOES 1-10, Defendants
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 16-1-0842)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Nathan Paco (Paco) appeals pro se
 
from the Judgment entered by the Circuit Court of the First
 
Circuit (Circuit Court) on October 4, 2016 (Judgment). Paco also
 
challenges the Circuit Court's August 23, 2016 Order Granting
 
Defendant Mary K. Myers, dba Mary K. Myers, Ph.D. dba Mary Myers,
 Ph.D., Inc., aka Mary K. Myers Trust's Motion to Dismiss 
 Plaintiff's Complaint filed April 29, 2016, filed July 6, 2016
 
with Prejudice (Dismissal Order).1
 
Paco raises three points of error on appeal, contending
 
that: (1) in an earlier civil suit (Civil No. 14-1-0576-03-KTN)
 (Prior Suit), a circuit court erred when it dismissed Paco's
 
complaint therein; (2) in this case, the Circuit Court erred when
 
it refused to relieve Paco of the judgment in the Prior Suit; and
 (3) the Circuit Court erred when it dismissed this case based on
 the statute of limitations, rather than applying the doctrine of
 equitable tolling.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Paco's points of error as follows:
 
(1) Both parties request that we take judicial notice
 
of the Prior Suit. It appears that judgment was entered against
 Paco in the Prior Suit on April 26, 2016, and that no relief from
 judgment was sought therein and no appeal was taken. Instead,
 Paco filed another suit raising the same allegations.
 
Paco seeks a ruling that the court in the Prior Suit
 
erred in dismissing that suit. However, appeals must be taken
 "in the manner and within the time provided by the rules of
 
court." Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(c) (2016). To

 appeal a civil matter, a notice of appeal "shall be filed within
 
30 days after entry of the judgment or appealable order." 
Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 4(a)(1) 
(emphasis added). 
Paco filed a Notice of Appeal in the instant case on
 
November 1, 2016. Even if Paco had identified the April 26, 2016
 
judgment in the Prior Suit in the Notice of Appeal, which he did
 not, such an appeal is now untimely under HRAP Rule 4(a)(1). 
Therefore, we lack appellate jurisdiction to consider the merits
 of Paco's first point of error.
 
(2) Paco similarly argues that the Circuit Court erred 
in denying him relief from the judgment in the Prior Suit. However, HRS § 602-57(1) (2016) gives the Hawai' i Intermediate 
Court of Appeals jurisdiction "[t]o hear and determine appeals from any court or agency when appeals are allowed by law." HRS § 641-1(a) (2016) authorizes appeals from "final judgments, orders, or decrees." Paco cites no authority granting a circuit court jurisdiction to hear an appeal or otherwise review a final judgment entered by another circuit court and, with respect to the circumstances here, we find none. Thus, we conclude that Paco's second point of error is without merit. 
(3) This case involves a medical malpractice claim
 
subject to a two-year statute of limitations.

 The Circuit Court's order references HRS § 657-7 (2016); however,
it appears that HRS § 657-7.3 (2016) applies in this case.

 concluded that "Plaintiff was required to file any claims
 
concerning alleged harm arising out of the treatment by Defendant
 Myers no later than April 2015." Paco does not dispute that,
 absent "equitable tolling," the complaint filed in this case on
 April 29, 2016, is barred by the applicable statute of
 limitations. 
Instead, Paco contends that the doctrine of equitable
 
tolling of the statute of limitations applies to the facts of
 this case. Paco relies primarily on Cervantes v. City of San
 Diego, 5 F.3d 1273 (9th Cir. 1993). In Cervantes, based on its
 application of California precedent, the court tolled the statute
 of limitations for a plaintiff's complaint after he had pursued
 remedies in another forum.
3 Id. at 1274. There, the plaintiff
 
pursued remedies in an administrative proceeding and appealed the
 adverse determination of the administrative authority to the
 state court. While pursuing administrative remedies, the
 
plaintiff was unable to pursue a remedy in another forum, i.e., a
 federal court proceeding. Id. The instant case is
 
3 The court held that, under California law, "[a] plaintiff's
pursuit of a remedy in another forum equitably tolls the limitations period if
the plaintiff's actions satisfy these factors: 1) timely notice to thedefendants in filing the first claim; 2) lack of prejudice to the defendantsin gathering evidence for the second claim; and 3) good faith and reasonableconduct in filing the second claim." Cervantes, 5 F.3d at 1275. After being
fired by the San Diego Fire Department, the plaintiff pursued administrativeremedies from November 1988 until September 7, 1989. Id. at 1274. He sought
review of the adverse determination by filing a petition for a writ of mandatewith the Superior Court in May 1990. Id. The state court denied the writ on 
August 31, 1990, and the plaintiff filed the federal suit at issue on March21, 1991. Id. Hawai'i courts have not adopted this three-part test.

 distinguishable from Cervantes on various grounds, most
 
importantly that Paco did not file this suit in a different
 forum; rather, Paco filed a new suit in the same forum rather
 than pursuing relief in the Prior Suit from the trial court, such
 as through an HRCP Rule 60(b) motion, or by way of appellate
 review of the judgment in the Prior Suit.
 
Hawai'i courts have recognized equitable tolling as 
"[t]he doctrine that the statute of limitations will not bar a claim if the plaintiff, despite diligent efforts, did not discover the injury until after the limitations period had expired." Narmore v. Kawafuchi, 112 Hawai' i 69, 75 n.15, 143 
P.3d 1271, 1277 n.15 (2006) (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 579 (8th ed. 2004)), superseded by statute on other grounds, HRS §§ 232–16, 17 (Supp. 2014). In considering whether a claim against the State was tolled, the supreme court has held: 
In order to toll a statute of limitations for a complaint
filed after its expiration, a plaintiff must demonstrate (1)
that he . . . has been pursuing his right diligently, and
(2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way.
Extraordinary circumstances are circumstances that are
beyond the control of the complainant and make it impossible
to file a complaint within the statute of limitations.
 
Office of Hawaiian Affairs v. State, 110 Hawai' i 338, 360, 133 
P.3d 767, 789 (2006) (citations and internal quotation marks 
omitted). 
Hawai'i courts have applied the doctrine of equitable 
tolling in other cases involving allegations of circumstances beyond the plaintiff's control. See, e.g., Roxas v. Marcos, 89 
5
 Hawai'i 91, 969 P.2d 1209 (1998) (where it was impossible under 
Philippines law to bring suit against Ferdinand Marcos so long as 
he was in power, limitations period was tolled); Wright v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 86 Hawai' i 357, 362, 949 P.2d 197, 202 
(App. 1997) ("[I]t is consistent with the purpose of the no-fault law to permit an insured to bring suit upon an unresolved claim after the two-year statute of limitations under HRS § 294-36(a)(2) has expired, provided the insured has made the claim for benefits before the running of the limitations period. To hold otherwise than we do would reward a delay in the disposition of an insured's claim, which effectively nullifies the insured's statutory right to arbitration of a disputed no-fault claim."). 
Here, Paco does not allege that the timing of the 
filing of the complaint herein was beyond his control. It was not. Paco made a tactical decision to file a new lawsuit, raising identical allegations as he made in the Prior Suit, rather than to file an appeal from the dismissal order and judgment in the Prior Suit. He cites no authority applying the doctrine of equitable tolling under such circumstances and we find none. Rather, in similar circumstances, where an initial complaint was dismissed without prejudice and the plaintiff filed a second complaint after the statute of limitations had run, the Hawai'i Supreme Court held the second complaint was time-barred. 
Eto v. Muranaka, 99 Hawai' i 488, 502-03, 57 P.3d 413, 427-28

 (2002). Accordingly, we conclude that this point of error is
 
without merit.
 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's October 4, 2016
 
Judgment is affirmed.
