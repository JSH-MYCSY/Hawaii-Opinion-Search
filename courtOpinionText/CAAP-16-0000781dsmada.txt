NO. CAAP-16-0000781 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS

 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
 
JAMYE WINDSOR, Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 15-1-1502)

 
ORDER
 
(By: 
Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of "Plaintiff-Appellant's Motion to Dismiss 
Appeal," filed on January 17, 2017, and the record, it appears 
that we lack jurisdiction over this appeal from the Circuit Court of the First Circuit's (circuit court's) September 30, 2016 
"Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Granting Motion 
to Dismiss Felony Information for Failure to Commence Timely Prosecution and/or Defective Felony Information" (Order Granting
Motion to Dismiss or Order) because the November 2, 2016 Notice 
of Appeal filed by Plaintiff-Appellant State of Hawai
'i (State), 
is untimely under Rule 4(b)(1) of the Hawai 'i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP). 
Although the appeal is authorized under Hawaii Revised
 
Statutes (HRS) § 641-13(1) (Repl. 2016), the State's motion
 
recognizes that its Notice of Appeal filed on November 2, 2016
 
was not filed within thirty days after entry of the September 30,
 2016 Order, as required by HRAP Rule 4(b)(1). The State did not
  obtain an extension of time to file the Notice of Appeal. 
Therefore, this appeal is untimely, under HRAP Rule 4(b).
 
An appellate court has an independent obligation to 
ensure jurisdiction over each case and to dismiss the appeal sua sponte if a jurisdictional defect exits. State v. Graybeard, 93 
Hawai‘i 513, 516, 6 P.3d 385, 388 (App. 2000). "As a general rule, compliance with the requirement of timely filing of a notice of appeal is jurisdictional, and we must dismiss an appeal on our motion if we lack jurisdiction." State v. Knight, 80 
Hawai
'i 318, 323, 909 P.2d 1133, 1138 (1996) (citation and 
internal quotation marks omitted). HRAP Rule 26(b) provides, in relevant part: 
The Hawai' i appellate courts . . . for good cause shown . .
. may extend the time prescribed by these rules for doing
any act, or may permit an act to be done after theexpiration of such time. Provided however, no court or
judge or justice is authorized to change the jurisdictionalrequirements contained in Rule 4 of these rules. 
(Emphasis added.) HRAP 26(e) provides, in relevant part, that
 
this court may "for good cause shown . . . relieve a party from
 a default occasioned by any failure to comply with these rules,
 except the failure to give timely notice of appeal." (Emphasis
 added.) 
Accordingly, this court lacks appellate jurisdiction
 
over the appeal.
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the State's motion to dismiss
 
the appeal is granted, and the appeal is dismissed for lack of
 appellate jurisdiction.
