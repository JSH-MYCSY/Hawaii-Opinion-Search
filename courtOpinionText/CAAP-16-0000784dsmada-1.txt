Hyunkong Chung (collectively, the Chungs) and the cross-appeal
 filed by Plaintiffs/Appellees/Cross-Appellants Brian E. Bennett
 and Debra S. Bennett (collectively, the Bennetts) from the
 Amended Judgment entered on October 25, 2016, by the Circuit
 Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court).

dismiss the Chungs' appeal and the Bennetts' cross-appeal.

I.
 
This case involves a dispute arising out of the sale of
 
real property, in which the Bennetts filed a complaint against
 
the Chungs. The parties decided to resolve their dispute through
 arbitration. On December 29, 2014, the arbitrator issued a
 Partial Final Award of money damages in the net amount of
 $373,000 in favor of the Bennetts and retained jurisdiction to
 determine attorney's fees and costs. On February 11, 2015, the
 arbitrator issued a Final Award, which incorporated the Partial
 Final Award and awarded attorney's fees of $93,250 and costs of
 $28,187.67 in favor of the Bennetts.
 
On February 17, 2015, the Bennetts filed a petition in
 
the Circuit Court to confirm the Final Award of the arbitrator
 (Motion to Confirm) pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 
§ 658A-22. On March 2, 2015, the Chungs filed a memorandum in
 opposition to the Motion to Confirm, advising the Circuit Court
 that they planned to file a motion to vacate the Final Award
 pursuant to HRS § 658A-23(d) and asking the Circuit Court to
 defer any decision until they filed their motion to vacate. On
 April 6, 2015, before the Chungs filed their motion to vacate,
 the Circuit Court issued its Order granting the Bennetts' Motion
 to Confirm (Order Granting Motion to Confirm). On April 6, 2015,
 pursuant to its Order Granting Motion to Confirm, the Circuit
 Court entered Judgment in favor of the Bennetts and against the
 Chungs in the total amount of $498,437.67. The Chungs did not
 appeal from the Order Granting Motion to Confirm or the April 6,
 2015, Judgment.
 
On May 13, 2015, the Chungs filed a motion to vacate
 
the Final Award of the arbitrator (Motion to Vacate), pursuant to
 HRS § 658A-23. On June 12, 2015, the Bennetts filed their
 opposition to the Motion to Vacate. On July 22, 2015, the
 Circuit Court issued its Order denying the Motion to Vacate
 (Order Denying Motion to Vacate).
 
On August 4, 2015, the Chungs filed a notice of appeal
 
from the April 6, 2015, Judgment and the July 22, 2015, Order

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Denying Motion to Vacate in Appeal No. CAAP-15-0000560. On
 
October 23, 2015, the Bennetts moved to dismiss the appeal or in
 the alternative to supplement the record (Motion to Dismiss). On
 November 2, 2015, the Chungs filed a memorandum in response to
 the Motion to Dismiss, in which they indicated their belief that 
the entry of an amended judgment by the Circuit Court to again
 confirm the Final Award was necessary for this court to review
 the Order Denying Motion to Vacate. Thereafter, the Chungs took
 no action after being notified that they were in default for
 failing to file a statement of jurisdiction and opening brief
 within the prescribed deadlines. On December 23, 2015, this
 court dismissed the appeal based on the failure of the Chungs to
 file a jurisdictional statement and opening brief, and we
 dismissed the Bennetts' Motion to Dismiss as moot. 
After the appeal in CAAP-15-0000560 was dismissed, the
 
Chungs on August 15, 2016, filed a motion in the Circuit Court
 requesting that the Circuit Court enter an amended judgment in
 favor of the Bennetts which incorporated the April 6, 2015,
 Judgment and the Order Denying Motion to Vacate. The Circuit
 Court granted this motion. On October 25, 2016, the Circuit
 Court filed an amended order which again denied the Chungs'
 Motion to Vacate (Amended Order Denying Motion to Vacate). On
 October 25, 2016, the Circuit Court entered the Amended Judgment,
 which amended the April 6, 2015, Judgment to incorporate the
 Amended Order Denying Motion to Vacate. 
On November 4, 2016, the Chungs filed a notice of
 
appeal from the Amended Judgment, and on November 18, 2016, the
 Bennetts filed a notice of cross-appeal from the Amended
 Judgment.
 
II.
 
HRS § 658A-23(b) provides that a motion to vacate an
 
arbitration award
 
shall be filed within ninety days after the movant receives
notice of the award pursuant to section 658A-19 or within
ninety days after the movant receives notice of a modified
or corrected award pursuant to section 658A-20, unless the
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
movant alleges that the award was procured by corruption,
fraud, or other undue means, in which case the motion shall
be made within ninety days after the ground is known or by
the exercise of reasonable care would have been known by the
movant.
 
HRS § 658A-23(b) provides a maximum ninety-day period for a party
 
to file a motion to vacate an arbitration award; it does not mean
 that in every case a party has up to ninety days to file a motion
 to vacate the award. See Hamm v. Millennium Income Fund, L.L.C.,
 
178 SW.3d 256, 264-68 (Tex. Ct. App. 2005) (construing similar
 statutory scheme). When the Bennetts filed their Motion to
 Confirm within a week of the arbitrator's issuance of the Final
 Award, it was incumbent on the Chungs to oppose the Motion to
 Confirm and/or to file their Motion to Vacate. The Chungs were
 not entitled to assume that they had the full ninety day period
 to file their Motion to Vacate.
 
The Circuit Court's April 6, 2015, Order Granting
 
Motion to Confirm, and its April 6, 2016, Judgment were both
 appealable final decisions pursuant to HRS § 658A-28. The Chungs
 could have appealed from the Order Granting Motion to Confirm and
 the April 6, 2016, Judgment, and argued, for instance, that the
 Circuit Court erred in failing to give the Chungs a fair
 opportunity to challenge the Motion to Confirm. However, the
 Chungs did not appeal. 
By the time the Chungs filed their Motion to Vacate on 
May 13, 2015, the time to appeal the April 6, 2016, Judgment had expired. Thus, it was already too late for the Chungs to move to vacate the Final Award. Even if we construe the Chung's Motion to Vacate as a post-judgment motion pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules of 
Civil Procedure Rule 60(b), the Chungs defaulted on their appeal from the Order Denying Motion to Vacate, which this court dismissed based on the Chungs' failure to file a jurisdictional statement and an opening brief. 
Under these circumstances, the Chungs were not entitled
 
to the entry of the Amended Judgment, which did not change the
 substance of the Circuit Court's April 6, 2016, Judgment or its
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Order Denying Motion to Vacate, but was entered for the sole 
purpose of giving the Chungs another chance to appeal the Circuit Court's prior decisions. The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has held that 
a trial court cannot remedy a party's failure to timely pursue appellate review of an appealable judgment or order by filing an amended judgment for the purpose of restarting the time period for appeal. Wong v. Wong, 79 Hawai
'i 26, 29-31, 897 P.2d 953, 
956-58 (1994). The supreme court has also recognized that an amended judgment that does not amend a prior judgment in a material and substantial respect does not trigger a new time period for appeal. See Korsak v. Hawaii Permanente Medical 
Group, 94 Hawai
'i 297, 304, 12 P.3d 1238, 1245 (2000). 
Here, the Amended Judgment did not restart the time
 
period for appeal from the April 6, 2016, Judgment or from the
 Order Denying Motion to Vacate, assuming this Order was an
 appealable post-judgment order. Thus, the Chungs' notice of
 appeal and the Bennetts' notice of cross-appeal were untimely. 
The failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a civil matter
 is a jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot waive and the
 appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise of judicial
 discretion. Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127,
 
1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b).
 
III. 
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal and
 
cross-appeal in CAAP-16-0000784 are dismissed for lack of
 appellate jurisdiction.
