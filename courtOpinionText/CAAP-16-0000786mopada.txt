OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI#I, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
ALEXANDER W. EWART, Defendant-Appellee
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CR. NO. 16-1-1065)
MEMORANDUM OPINION
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Wadsworth, JJ.)
In this case, Defendant-Appellee Alexander W. Ewart
(Ewart) is charged with the offense of Habitually Operating a
Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant ( Habitual OVUII ) in
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS ) §§ 291E-61.5(a)(1) and
291E-61.5(a)(2)(A) and/or §§ 291E-61.5(a)(1) and 291E
61.5(a)(2)(C) (2007 & Supp. 2018).  
Plaintiff-Appellant State of Hawai#i (State) appeals
from the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting
in Part and Denying in Part Defendant's Motion to Suppress
Statement, SFST, and Breath Test ( Suppression Order) filed on
October 10, 2016 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
(Circuit Court ).  In the Suppression Order, the Circuit Court, 1
1  The Honorable Glenn J. Kim presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
inter alia , suppressed all evidence regarding a breath test taken
by Ewart.
On appeal, the State asserts the following points of
error:
1.The circuit court erred in Conclusions of Law part
III(A) and (B) and Order that the standard HPD Implied
Consent Form "does not comply with the requirements
and mandate of HRS Sections 291E-11, 291E-15, and
291E-65, read in pari materia ", because it does not
give an OVUII suspect an "unencumbered choice to
refuse to submit to a test for alcohol concentration"
and that therefore any purported consent given by an
OVUII suspect pursuant to that form is "null and
void"[.]
2.The circuit court erred in concluding in Conclusions
of Law part III(C) and Order that "burdening an
arrestee's election to refuse with any significant
sanctions  cannot help but render any subsequent
purported consent legally insufficient and therefore
null and void"[.]
3.The circuit court erred in concluding in Conclusions
of Law part III(C) and Order that because "[t]here is
no possibility for an arrestee to know that the
sanctions are solely administrative rather than
criminal, much less exactly what those sanctions
specifically are or even what they may be" it is
"simply not possible" for an arrestee to give
"'knowing' or 'intelligent'" consent[.]
We vacate the Suppression Order to the extent that it
suppressed evidence regarding Ewart's breath test.
I.  Brief Background
On July 2, 2016, at 2:27 a.m., Ewart was pulled over by
a Honolulu Police Department ( HPD) officer for operating his
vehicle without the headlights illuminated.  Upon interacting
with Ewart, the officer noticed that Ewart's eyes were bloodshot
and glassy, and detected a strong odor of some kind of alcoholic
beverage on Ewart's breath.  After a field sobriety test was
conducted, Ewart was arrested and taken to the Kapolei police
station.  After arriving at the police station, Ewart was read an
HPD form entitled "Use of Intoxicants While Operating A Vehicle
Implied Consent For Testing", form HPD-396K (R-11/15) ( Implied
Consent Form), which states in relevant part:
Pursuant to chapter 291E, [HRS], Use of Intoxicants While
Operating a Vehicle, you are being informed of the following:
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
1. ___ Any person who operates a vehicle upon a public way,
street, road, or highway or on or in the waters of the State shall
be deemed to have given consent to a test or tests for the purpose
of determining alcohol concentration or drug content of the
person[']s breath, blood, or urine as applicable.
2. ___ You are not entitled to an attorney before you submit to
any tests or tests to determine your alcohol and/or drug content.
3. ___ You may refuse to submit to a breath or blood test, or both
for the purpose of determining alcohol concentration and/or blood
or urine test, or both for the purpose of determining drug
content. If you do refuse, then none shall be given, except as
provided in section 291E-21.  However, if you refuse to submit to
a breath, blood, or urine test, you may be subject to up to the
sanctions of 291E-65 if you are under 21 years of age at the time
of the offense.  In addition, you may also be subject to the
procedures and sanctions under chapter 291E, part III.   
As found by the Circuit Court, Ewart was asked "to follow along
and initial the form to indicate that he understood what he was
being told."  Ewart initialed and signed the form, consenting to
a breath test.  The breath test was administered, and Ewart was
charged with Habitual OVUII.
On August 10, 2016, Ewart filed a Motion to Suppress,
and as is relevant here, asked the Circuit Court to “[suppress]
and [preclude] from the use at trial . . . Breath Results based
upon the violation of [Ewart’s] rights under Article 1, Section 7 
of the Hawai# i State Constitution” (Motion to Suppress), because
the Informed Consent Form was misleading.   2
On October 5, 2016, a hearing was held on the Motion to
Suppress, and the Circuit Court orally granted Ewart's motion to
the extent he sought to suppress evidence of his breath test.  
On October 10, 2016, the Circuit Court filed its written Findings
of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order.  The Circuit Court
determined, as to the breath test, that: the consent from Ewart
was illegally obtained because HRS §§ 291E-11 and 291E-15, read
in pari materia, require that an arrested person first be given a
completely unencumbered choice to refuse testing, and then if an
arrestee refuses, it is only then that the arrestee must be
2  In that same motion, Ewart moved to suppress a statement he made to a
police officer and the results of the field sobriety test.  However, those
issues are not raised in this appeal.
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
informed of possible sanctions for refusal and asked whether the
arrestee still refuses to submit to testing; HRS § 291E-15(2)
provides that the arrestee is not subject to refusal sanctions if
this procedure is not followed; consent may not be burdened by
the threat of any significant sanctions; and the Implied Consent
Form did not make it clear what the sanctions were specifically,
or that they were solely administrative and not criminal.  The
Circuit Court thus granted Ewart's motion to the extent that it
sought suppression of all evidence regarding the breath test.  
II.  Discussion
Recently, in a very similar case, our court decided
identical issues.  See State v. Hosaka, 144 Hawai#i 420, 421, 443
P.3d 112, 113 (App. 2019), cert. granted , No. SCWC-16-0000716,
2019 WL 4733560 (Sept. 27, 2019).  In Hosaka, defendant Troy
Hosaka (Hosaka ) was arrested and then charged with the offenses
of Habitual OVUII and Operating a Vehicle After License and
Privilege Have Been Suspended or Revoked for Operating a Vehicle
Under the Influence of an Intoxicant, in violation of HRS
§ 291E-62(a)(2) (Supp. 2016).  After his arrest, Hosaka was read
the same HPD Implied Consent Form used in the present case,  and
Hosaka agreed to take a breath test.  Id. at 421-22, 443 P.3d at
113-14.3
Hosaka filed a motion to suppress his breath test
results at trial.  Id. at 422, 443 P.3d at 114.  Hosaka asserted
arguments similar to this case, including that the Implied
Consent Form did not follow the procedure required by HRS
§§ 291E-11 (2007) and 291E-15 (Supp. 2015), and therefore, his
consent was involuntary and the test constituted a warrantless
search.  Id.
The trial court in Hosaka suppressed Hosaka's breath
test results based on similar grounds as in the present case. 
Id.  The State appealed, and this court vacated the suppression
3  In both this case and Hosaka, the form utilized by police was form
HPD-396K (R-11/15).
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
of the breath test evidence.  Id. at 428, 443 P.3d at 120.  This
court ruled, in pertinent part that:
Based on our reading of HRS §§ 291E-11 and 291E-15, read in
pari materia, and our interpretation of the legislative
intent behind these statutes, we conclude that the Implied
Consent Form did not comport with the procedure set forth in
HRS §§ 291E-11 and 291E-15 because it did not provide an
initial opportunity for Hosaka to refuse to submit to
testing before being informed of possible sanctions.
Id. at 426, 443 P.3d at 118.  However, we further held that the
suppression of the breath test was not a proper remedy.  Id. at
426-28, 443 P.3d at 118-20.  Specifically, we explained in
Hosaka:
We do not agree with Hosaka's interpretation of HRS
§ 291E-15 as barring the imposition of sanctions where an
arrestee was not given two distinct opportunities to refuse
to submit to testing. Rather, we interpret the provision as
barring the imposition of sanctions where the arrestee was
not informed of the sanctions .
. . .
In this case, the Implied Consent Form did inform Hosaka of
the possible sanctions and Hosaka was given an opportunity
to refuse with that information in mind. The Implied Consent
Form therefore complied with paragraphs (1) and (2) of HRS
§ 291E-15 and it correctly stated that sanctions may be
imposed. Accordingly, the Implied Consent Form did not
include inaccurate or misleading information about whether
sanctions may be imposed and Hosaka's consent cannot be
considered uninformed on this basis. Thus, the circuit court
erred in granting Hosaka's Motion to Suppress on the basis
that the Implied Consent Form contained inaccurate or
misleading information because it did not comply with the
procedure set forth in HRS §§ 291E-11 and 291E-15.
Id. at 426-27, 443 P.3d at 118-19 (footnote omitted) (emphasis in
original).  
Here, Hosaka is dispositive in favor of the State on
its first point of error.  That is, although the Implied Consent
Form did not give Ewart an initial opportunity to refuse the
breath test before he was informed about possible sanctions, this
did not make his consent to the test null and void.  As noted in
Hosaka, the applicable statutes do not mandate that a breath test
be suppressed where the two-step process is not followed. 
Indeed, as noted in Hosaka, and even in Ewart's answering brief,
the statutory amendments to HRS § 291E-15 in 2006, which adopted
the two-step process, were intended to simplify the implied
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
consent requirements by requiring a law enforcement officer to
inform an arrested driver about sanctions that could be imposed
for refusing a test only if the person withdraws the consent to
testing that is implied by operating a vehicle on a public road. 
Hosaka, 144 Hawai# i at 425-26, 443 P.3d at 117-18; see also H.
Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 762-06, in 2006 House Journal, at 1391-92;
S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 3085, in 2006 Senate Journal, at 1494-
95; S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 3303, in 2006 Senate Journal, at
1587; H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 310-06, in 2006 House Journal, at
1217-18.  The legislative history for the 2006 amendments does
not indicate an intent to suppress breath tests in criminal cases
because law enforcement officers did not comply with the
simplified two-step procedure.
We further note that the Circuit Court relied on State
v. Wilson, 92 Hawai#i 45, 987 P.2d 268 (1999), in determining
that, because the Implied Consent Form incorrectly informed Ewart
about possible sanctions where the two-step process was not
followed, the form was misleading and thus Ewart's consent was
ineffective.  In Hosaka, to the contrary, this court held that
the Implied Consent form did not include inaccurate or misleading
information about whether sanctions may be imposed.  Hosaka, 144
Hawai#i at 426-27, 443 P.3d at 118-19.  Further, this case is
unlike Wilson, where it was undisputed that the defendant was
misinformed about the sanction that would apply if he consented
to testing and failed the test.
Hosaka is also dispositive in favor of the State as to
its second and third points of error.  Hosaka held that the
Implied Consent Form advised the defendant about civil
administrative sanctions and was consistent with State v. Won,
137 Hawai#i 330, 349 n.34, 372 P.3d 1065, 1084 n.34 (2015).
III.  Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, to the extent that the Circuit
Court suppressed all evidence regarding the breath test, we
vacate the "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order
Granting in Part and Denying in Part Defendant's Motion to

Suppress Statement, SFST, and Breath Test" filed on October 10,
