(3) the stipulation is dated and signed by counsel for all
 
parties appearing in the appeal; and (4) because the appeal has
 not been docketed, dismissal is authorized by HRAP Rule 42(a),
 rather than HRAP Rule 42(b).
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the stipulation to
 
dismiss the appeal is approved and the appeal is dismissed. The
 parties shall bear their own costs and attorneys' fees on appeal.
