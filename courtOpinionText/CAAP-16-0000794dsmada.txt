NO. CAAP-16-0000794
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
THE ESTATE OF MOANA P. RAMOS, Deceased-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE PROBATE COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(P.
 NO. 16-1-0031(3))
 
ORDER GRANTING FEBRUARY 16, 2017 MOTION TO
DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) Petitioner-Appellee Dr. David
 
Wittenberg's (Appellee Wittenberg) February 16, 2017 motion to
 
dismiss appellate court case number CAAP-16-0000794 for lack of
 appellate jurisdiction, (2) the lack of any memorandum by
 Interested Party-Appellant Kirk Giordano (Appellant Giordano) in
 response to Appellee Wittenberg's February 16, 2017 motion, and
 (3) the record, it appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction
 over Appellant Giordano's appeal from the two interlocutory
 orders that the Honorable Joseph E. Cardoza filed on February 23,
 2016, and October 17, 2016, in the probate court proceeding in
 P. No. 16-1-0031(3) because the probate court has not yet entered
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
a final judgment in this probate court proceeding, as Hawaii 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (2016) and Rule 34 of the Hawai
'i Probate Rules (HPR) require. 
HRS § 641-1(a) that authorizes appeals from a probate 
court's final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). The Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has 
promulgated rules specifically for probate court proceedings, including HPR Rule 19, which provides that "[a] contested matter is any one in which an objection has been filed." 
Appellant Giordano filed an objection to (a) Appellant
 
Wittenberg's petition to appoint a special administrator of the
 Estate of Moana P. Ramos in P. No. 16-1-0031(3) and (b) the
 probate court's resulting February 23, 2016 interlocutory order
 granting Appellant Wittenberg's petition, when Appellant Giordano
 filed his September 1, 2016 motion for reconsideration of the
 February 23, 2016 interlocutory order. HPR Rule 20(f) provides
 that "[a]n order resolving the issues in a contested matter shall
 be reduced to judgment in accordance with Rule 34 of these rules
 and may be appealed as provided therein." In addition, HPR Rule
 34(a) generally requires the entry of a separate judgment as a
 prerequisite for perfecting an aggrieved party's right to assert
 an appeal:
 
RULE 34. ENTRY OF JUDGMENT, INTERLOCUTORY ORDERS, APPEALS
(a) Entry of Judgment. All formal testacy orders,
orders of intestacy and determination of heirs, orders
establishing conservatorship and/or guardianship, and orders
establishing protective arrangements shall be reduced to
judgment
 and the judgment shall be filed with the clerk of

the court. Such judgments shall be final and immediately
appealable as provided by statute
. Any other order that
fully addresses all claims raised in a petition to which it
relates, but that does not finally end the proceeding, may
be certified for appeal in the manner provided by Rule 54(b)
of the Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure.
 
-2­ NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
(b) Interlocutory Orders. In order to appeal from any
other order prior to the conclusion of the proceeding, the
order must be certified for appeal in accordance with
Section 641-1(b) of the Hawai'i Revised Statutes.
(c) Final Judgment Closing Proceeding. At the
 
conclusion of the proceeding, a final judgment closing the
proceeding shall be entered and filed with the clerk of the
court, at which time all prior uncertified interlocutory
orders shall become immediately appealable.
(d) Appeals. Final judgments as to all claims and
parties, certified judgments, certified orders, and other
orders appealable as provided by law may be appealed
pursuant to the Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure
applicable to civil actions.
 
HPR Rule 34 (emphases added). 
"Rule 34 is written to conform probate practice to the 
policy against piecemeal appeals, see, e.g., Jenkins v. Cades 
Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Haw. 115, 869 P.2d 1334, 1994 Haw. LEXIS 19 (1994), to bring certainty to the timing of when and how an appeal can be taken, and to comply with the provisions of HRS § 641-1." Michie's Hawaii Revised Statutes Annotated Court 
Rules, HPR Rule 34 cmt. (Michie 2017). Under the holding in Jenkins, "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 
1338 (1994). Thus, in cases where HPR Rule 34 applies, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has consistently held that when "final 
judgment terminating the proceeding has not been entered, and these [appealed] orders were not certified for appeal . . . those orders are not before us." In re Guardianship of Carlsmith, 113 
Hawai
'i 211, 223, 151 P.3d 692, 704 (2006). 
On January 3, 2017, the probate court clerk filed the
 
record on appeal for appellate court case number CAAP-16-0000794,
 which does not contain an appealable final HPR Rule 34 judgment
 or interlocutory order. Although exceptions to the final
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
judgment requirement exist under the doctrine in Forgay v. 
Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848) (the Forgay doctrine), the collateral order doctrine, and HRS § 641-1(b) (2016), neither of the subject interlocutory orders satisfies the requirements for appealability under these doctrines or HRS § 641-1(b). See Ciesla v. Reddish, 
78 Hawai
'i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) (regarding the two 
requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright
, 
88 Hawai 'i 319, 322, 966 
P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding the three requirements for the collateral order doctrine); HRS § 641-1(b) (regarding the requirements for an appeal from an interlocutory order). Absent an appealable HPR Rule 34 final judgment or interlocutory order, we lack appellate jurisdiction, and Appellant Giordano's appeal is premature. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellee
 
Wittenberg's February 16, 2017 motion to dismiss appellate court

 
case number CAAP-16-0000794 is granted and appellate court case
 number CAAP-16-0000794 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
