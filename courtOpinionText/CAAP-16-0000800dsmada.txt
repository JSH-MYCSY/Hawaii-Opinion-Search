IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI# I, By Its Office of Consumer Protection,
Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
DEBORAH ANN HOKULANI JOSHUA, Defendant-Appellant,
and
RONALD R. RABANG and MATTHEW G. AIELLO, Defendants-Appellees
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 08-1-0240-02)
ORDER GRANTING DECEMBER 12, 2016 MOTION TO
DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
Upon review of (1) Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai# i,
By Its Office of Consumer Protection's (Appellee State Office of
Consumer Protection), December 12, 2016 motion to dismiss appeal
for lack of appellate jurisdiction, (2) the lack of any
memorandum by Defendant/Cross-Claim Defendant/Appellant Deborah
Ann Hokulani Joshua (Appellant Joshua) in response to Appellee
State Office of Consumer Protection's December 12, 2016 motion,
and (3) the record, it appears that we lack appellate
jurisdiction over Appellant Joshua's appeal from the Honorable
Jeannette H. Castagnetti's October 6, 2016 second amended
judgment, because Appellant Joshua's November 9, 2016 notice of
appeal was not timely under Rule 4(a)(1) of the Hawai# i Rules of
Appellate Procedure (HRAP).NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
-2-We initially note that Appellant Joshua's November 9,
2016 notice of appeal purported to assert an appeal from the
circuit court's September 28, 2016 minute order indicating the
circuit court's intent to enter a second amended judgment,
despite that "a minute order is not an appealable order."  Abrams
v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai #i 319, 321 n.3, 966
P.2d 631, 633 n.3 (1998) (emphasis added).  Nevertheless, we
infer that Appellant Joshua actually sought appellate review of
the resulting October 6, 2016 second amended judgment.  See HRAP
Rule 3(c)(2) ("An appeal shall not be dismissed for informality
of form or title of notice of appeal.").  
The October 6, 2016 second amended judgment resolved
all claims against all parties by expressly
• entering judgment in favor of Appellee State
Office of Consumer Protection and against
Appellant Joshua and Defendants/Cross-Claim
Plaintiffs/Appellees Ronald R. Rabang and Matthew
G. Aiello as to all six counts in Appellee State
Office of Consumer Protection's complaint, and
• dismissing all other claims.
Therefore, the October 6, 2016 second amended judgment was an
immediately appealable final judgment under HRS § 641-1(a),
Hawai#i Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 58, and the holding in
Jenkins.
"When a civil appeal is permitted by law, the notice of
appeal shall be filed within 30 days after entry of the judgment
or appealable order."  HRAP Rule 4(a)(1).  The thirtieth calendar
day after October 6, 2016, was Saturday, November 5, 2016, and,
thus, HRAP Rule 26(a) extended the thirty-day time period under
HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) until Monday, November 7, 2016.  However,
Appellant Joshua failed to file her November 9, 2015 notice of
appeal within thirty days after entry of the October 6, 2016
second amended final judgment, as HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) required for
a timely appeal.  The failure to file a timely notice of appeal
in a civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the parties
cannot waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in the
exercise of judicial discretion.  Bacon v. Karlin , 68 Haw. 648,
650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court orNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
-3-judge or justice is authorized to change the jurisdictional
requirements contained in Rule 4 of these rules."); HRAP Rule
26(e) ("The reviewing court for good cause shown may relieve a
party from a default occasioned by any failure to comply with
these rules, except the failure to give timely notice of
appeal.").  Therefore, we do not have appellate jurisdiction over
Appellant Joshua's appeal in appellate court case number CAAP-16-
0000800.
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellee State
Office of Consumer Protection's December 12, 2016 motion to
dismiss appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction is granted, and
appellate court case number CAAP-16-0000800 is dismissed for lack
of appellate jurisdiction.
