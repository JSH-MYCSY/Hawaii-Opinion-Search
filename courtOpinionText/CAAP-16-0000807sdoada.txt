APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 10-1-1388)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Ginoza, C.J., Fujise and Chan, JJ.)
Defendants-Appellants Jonnaven Jo Monalim and Misty 
Marie Monalim (collectively, the Monalims ) contest the following
entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit1 (circuit
court) on October 13, 2016: 
(1) the "Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part
Plaintiff HawaiiUSA Federal Credit Union's Motion for Deficiency
1  The Honorable Bert I. Ayabe presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Judgment Against [the Monalims] Filed January 12, 2016" (10/13/16
Order Granting Deficiency Amount); and
(2) "Deficiency Judgment Against [the Monalims] in
Favor of Plaintiff[-Appellee] HawaiiUSA Federal Credit Union
[(HawaiiUSA )]" (10/13/16 Deficiency Judgment). 
On appeal, the Monalims contend2 that (1) HawaiiUSA was
guilty of laches; (2) the circuit court erred in its refusal to
conduct an evidentiary hearing regarding HawaiiUSA's delay in
seeking a deficiency judgment; and (3) the circuit court erred by
denying the Monalims procedural and substantive due process
rights under the Hawai# i State Constitution and the United States
Constitution by depriving them of property without an evidentiary
hearing to determine the fair value of the property at the time
of the confirmation sale. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve the
Monalims' points of error as follows and affirm as set forth
below.
This dispute arises from a judicial foreclosure in
which the Monalims appeal from the 10/13/16 Deficiency Judgment.  
On January 12, 2016, after the circuit court entered a
foreclosure judgment in its favor and approximately four years
after confirmation of the sale of the Property, HawaiiUSA filed
its "Motion for Deficiency Judgment Against [the Monalims]"
2  The Monalims also argue in their points of error section that:  the
10/13/16 Deficiency Judgment "was contrary to the law of the case" and
HawaiiUSA's delay in seeking a deficiency judgment "irreparably prejudiced"
the Monalims because they relied on HawaiiUSA's waiver.  However, contentions
not argued on appeal are deemed waived.  Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure
(HRAP) Rule 28(b)(7); In re Guardianship of Carlsmith, 113 Hawai #i 236, 246,
151 P.3d 717, 727 (2007) (noting that an appellate court may "disregard a
particular contention if the appellant makes no discernible argument in
support of that position") (internal quotation marks, brackets omitted, and
citation omitted).
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(1/12/16 Deficiency Motion ).  On February 16, 2016, the Monalims
filed their opposition to the 1/12/16 Deficiency Motion arguing
that HawaiiUSA's Deficiency Motion was untimely and in violation
of due process of law, and, that an evidentiary hearing should be
held to determine the fair market value of the subject property.
The circuit court subsequently entered the 10/13/16 Order
Granting Deficiency Amount and the 10/13/16 Deficiency Judgment
in favor of HawaiiUSA and against the Monalims in the amount of
$493,282.04.
(1) Laches
The Monalims contend that HawaiiUSA was guilty of
laches because the 1/12/16 Deficiency Motion was not filed at the
time of the confirmation of sale in December 2011.  Instead,
HawaiiUSA filed the 1/12/16 Deficiency Motion in 2016,
approximately four years later.  The Monalims cite to BayBank
Connecticut, N.A. v. Thumlert, 222 Conn. 784, 610 A.2d 658 (1992)
to argue that HawaiiUSA's delay in filing a deficiency motion
prejudiced the Monalims and thus the defense of laches is
applicable.  Aside from a cursory mention of Thumlert, the
Monalims provide no authority to support their contention. 
The Monalims do not point to a statutory time limit for
the filing of a deficiency judgment.  Moreover, the Monalims had
notice of the possibility of a deficiency judgment at the summary
judgment stage and following the confirmation of the sale of the
property.  On August 29, 2011, the circuit court entered its
"Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting
Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment as to All Claims and All
Parties, Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure and Order of Sale"
(8/29/11 FOF/COL/Order ) which stated: 
11. At the hearing for confirmation of sale, if it
appears that proceeds of the sale of the Mortgage Property
are insufficient to pay all amounts due and owing to
Plaintiff, Plaintiff may request a deficiency judgment in
its favor and against [the Monalims], jointly and severally,
for the amount of the deficiency which shall be determined
at the time of confirmation and have immediate execution
thereafter. 
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
On November 9, 2011, HawaiiUSA filed its "Motion for 
Confirmation of Sale, Directing Distribution of Proceeds, for
Deficiency Judgment, Writ of Possession and Disposal of Personal
Property" ( 11/9/11 Confirmation Motion) where it moved for the
circuit court to enter an order in favor of HawaiiUSA and
"against [the Monalims], jointly and severally, for the amount of
any deficiency, if the proceeds from the sale of the Mortgaged
Property are insufficient to fully satisfy the amounts due to
[HawaiiUSA]."  At the hearing on the 11/9/11 Confirmation Motion,
the circuit court granted HawaiiUSA's motion but the minutes
provide that the Monalims' counsel objected and the circuit court
ordered a further hearing on the deficiency judgment.3  Thus, it
appears that upon the Monalims' objection, a deficiency judgment
amount was not determined during the hearing.  The Monalims argue
that because the 8/29/11 FOF/COL/Order stated that the deficiency
amount "shall be determined at the time of confirmation" and it
was not determined at that time, such inaction "should be enough
in itself to mandate reversal[.]"  However, we hold that because
the Monalims objected and sought a further hearing on the
deficiency judgment, this argument is without merit. 
On December 11, 2011, the circuit court entered its
"Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Confirmation of Sale,
Directing Distribution of Proceeds, for Deficiency Judgment, Writ
of Possession and Disposal of Personal Property Filed November 9,
2011" (12/22/11 Confirmation Order) and ordered that "since the
proceeds from the sale of the Mortgaged Property are insufficient
to fully satisfy the amounts due to [HawaiiUSA], that a motion
for deficiency judgment may subsequently be filed by [HawaiiUSA]
against [the Monalims], jointly and severally." 
3  On December 1, 2011, the circuit court held a hearing on the motion
for confirmation of sale.  The record does not contain a transcript of the
hearing.  However, the minutes provide that the circuit court granted the
11/9/11 Confirmation Motion, however "[w]ith objection made by Mr. Dubin,
Court ordered further hearing on deficiency judgment."
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
The 1/12/16 Deficiency Motion included a calculation of
the deficiency amount due and owing after the sale proceeds were
applied.  Thus, at both the summary judgment stage and following
the 12/22/11 Confirmation Order, the Monalims were on notice as
to the possibility of a deficiency judgment being filed.  The
Monalims also were aware of the 12/22/11 Confirmation Order and
the likely deficiency that would remain following the sale of the
property.  The Monalims fail to provide a discernable argument as
to laches and they were on notice of the deficiency amount such
that their contentions related to prejudice are without merit. 
(2) Evidentiary hearing on prejudice
The Monalims contend that the circuit court should have
held an evidentiary hearing on prejudice because the Monalims
could have filed for bankruptcy and "in effect suffered no
deficiency judgment at all" but for HawaiiUSA's delay in seeking
a deficiency judgment.  The Monalims also maintain that they
sought an evidentiary hearing before the circuit court and the
circuit court denied such a hearing. 
With regard to the contention that a hearing on
prejudice should have been held, the Monalims argue that the
circuit court refused their request for such a hearing.  However,
the record shows that the Monalims did not request a hearing on
prejudice in their opposition to HawaiiUSA's 1/12/16 Deficiency
Motion or file any motions seeking such a hearing.  Accordingly,
the circuit court did not deny such a motion or request for a
hearing.
Further, the circuit court did address potential
prejudice to the Monalims.  In its 1/12/16 Deficiency Motion,
HawaiiUSA sought interest on the deficiency balance from December
30, 2011, to the date of the entry of the deficiency judgment.
However in its 10/13/16 Order Granting Deficiency Amount, the
circuit court denied HawaiiUSA's "request for continuing interest
on Counts I and Count II, from December 30, 2011 closing date to
the entry of the Deficiency Judgment as well as [Hawaii USA]
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Plaintiff's request for statutory interest after the entry of the
Deficiency Judgment due to the delay in filing the instant
Motion."  (Emphasis added).  Thus, the circuit court did not
permit HawaiiUSA to benefit from its delay in filing the 1/12/16
Deficiency Motion and thereby prejudice the Monalims. 
Moreover, following the 12/22/11 Confirmation Order ,
the Monalims did not seek a dismissal under Hawai# i Rules of
Civil Procedure ( HRCP) Rule 41(b)(1) or the Rules of the Circuit
Courts of the State of Hawai# i.  The record shows that between
the circuit court's 12/22/11 Confirmation Order  and HawaiiUSA's
1/12/16 Deficiency Judgment, the Monalims did not file any
motions to bring closure to the proceeding. 
(3) Evidentiary hearing on amount owed    
The Monalims assert that the process in Hawai #i for
determining deficiency judgments violates their due process
rights and in calculating the deficiency judgment, an evidentiary
hearing should have been held to determine the fair market value
of the foreclosed property.  
In response, HawaiiUSA notes that foreclosures in this
jurisdiction are bifurcated into two separate appealable parts
and that the Monalims have previously filed an appeal in this
case.  The Monalims previously appealed and challenged the
circuit court's 8/29/11 FOF/COL/Order and the related Judgment
(8/29/11 Foreclosure Judgment) both filed on August 29, 2011,
which resulted in appellate court case number CAAP-11-0000710
(First Appeal).  HawaiiUSA Fed. Credit Union v. Monalim , No.
CAAP-11–0000710, 2012 WL 4122914, at *1  (Haw. App. Sept. 19,
2012).  The Monalims' First Appeal was dismissed pursuant to HRAP
Rule 30 for their failure to file an opening brief or seek relief
from the default of the opening brief.  The Monalims also
indicated that they were in the "process of circulating a
stipulation for dismissal of this Appeal," however, no
stipulation was filed.  Id.  Thus, while the Monalims had the
6NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
opportunity, they failed to raise any point of error relating to
the Monalims' liability for a deficiency judgment or how a
deficiency judgment would be calculated. 
As noted above, the 8/29/11 FOF/COL/Order ordered that
HawaiiUSA may request a deficiency judgment as follows: 
11. At the hearing for confirmation of sale, if it
appears that proceeds of the sale of the Mortgaged Property
are insufficient to pay all amounts due and owing to
[HawaiiUSA], [HawaiiUSA] may request a deficiency judgment
in its favor and against [the Monalims], jointly and
severally, for the amount of the deficiency which shall be
determined at the time of confirmation and have immediate
execution thereafter. 
(Emphasis added).
In Mortg. Elec. Registration Sys., Inc. v. Wise, the
Hawai#i Supreme Court exercised appellate jurisdiction but held
in a judicial foreclosure action that challenges to a foreclosure
judgment were barred by res judicata  where the defendants failed
to appeal from the initial foreclosure judgment. 130 Hawai# i 11,
304 P.3d 1192 (2013).  
In this case, similar to Wise, we exercise appellate
jurisdiction but hold that the Monalims are precluded from
challenging the method of calculating their deficiency judgment. 
The Monalims' right to a deficiency judgment and the method for
calculating the deficiency judgment were adjudicated and set
forth in the 8/29/11 FOF/COL/Order, and incorporated into the
related 8/29/11 Foreclosure Judgment.  Although the Monalims
timely appealed from the subsequent 10/13/16 Deficiency Judgment,
they are only entitled to challenge the errors unique to that
10/13/16 Deficiency Judgment.  See id.  at 16, 304 P.3d at 1197;
Ke Kailani Partners, LLC v. Ke Kailani Dev. LLC , Nos.
CAAP–12–0000758 and CAAP–12–0000070, 2016 WL 2941054, at *7 (Haw.
App. Apr. 29, 2016) (Mem. Op.), cert. denied , 2016 WL 4651424, at
*1 (Haw. Sept. 6, 2016) (holding, inter alia , that appellants had
waived their challenge to the method used to determine a
deficiency judgment by dismissing a prior appeal from a
foreclosure order that had set forth the entitlement to a
7NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
deficiency judgment and the method for determining the amount);
see also LCP-Maui, LLC v. Tucker, No. CAAP-15-0000109, 2018 WL
1082855, at *1-2 (Haw. App. Feb. 28, 2018) (SDO) (holding that
appellant was precluded from challenging the method of
calculating her deficiency judgment because she previously
appealed the foreclosure judgment). 
Thus, the Monalims' arguments on appeal related to the
issue of a delayed 1/12/16 Deficiency Motion are without merit. 
With respect to the arguments on appeal related to the method by
which the deficiency would be calculated, the 10/13/16 Deficiency
Judgment in this appeal did not adjudicate the method, but rather
was incident to the enforcement of the earlier 8/29/11
Foreclosure Judgment.  See Wise , 130 Hawai #i at 16, 304 P.3d at
1197.  Accordingly, the Monalims are precluded from challenging
the method of calculating their deficiency judgment and their
remaining arguments on appeal are without merit.  
Therefore,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Deficiency Judgment
Against Defendants Jonnaven Jo Monalim and Misty Marie Monalim in
Favor of Plaintiff HawaiiUSA Federal Credit Union," entered on
October 13, 2016, in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
is affirmed.
