ALBERTO GARCIA,
Defendant-Appellee
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CRIMINAL NO. 14-1-1999)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Leonard and Chan, JJ.)
Plaintiff-Appellant State of Hawai #i (State) appeals
from the "Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and Order
Granting Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Count 1 of the Indictment
for Lack of Probable Cause" (Order Granting Motion to Dismiss)
filed on October 17, 2016 in the Circuit Court of the First
Circuit (circuit court).1  On December 24, 2014, the State
charged Defendant-Appellee Alberto Garcia (Garcia) with Promoting
Prison Contraband in the First Degree (Count 1).  Count 1 states:
On or about January 30, 2014, in the City and County of
Honolulu, State of Hawai# i, ALBERTO GARCIA, a person
confined in Oahu Community Correctional Center, a
correctional or detention facility, did intentionally
possess a drug, to wit, AB-FUBINACA, thereby committing the
offense of Promoting Prison Contraband in the First Degree
in violation of Section 710-1022(1)(b) of the Hawaii Revised
Statutes. Pursuant to Section 710-1022(2) of the Hawaii
Revised Statutes, a "drug" shall include dangerous drugs,
detrimental drugs, harmful drugs, intoxicating compounds,
marijuana and marijuana concentrates as listed in SectionNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
2 After the date of the instant offense, AB-FUBINACA was added to the
ist of "Schedule I" substances, and thus it now falls within the definition
f a "[d]angerous drug[]" under HRS §§ 710-1022 and 712-1240.  See HRS § 329-
4(g)(15) (Supp. 2016).l

§ 710-1022  Promoting prison contraband in the first degree. 
2712-1240 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes; a drug may only be
possessed by or conveyed to a confined person with the
facility administrator's express prior approval and under
medical supervision. Pursuant to Section 712-1240 of the
Hawaii Revised Statutes, "intoxicating compounds" means any
compound, liquid or chemical containing toluol, hexane,
trichloroethylene, acetone, toluene, ethyl acetate, methyl
ethyl ketone, trichloroethane, isopropanol, methyl isobutyl
ketone, methyl cellosolve acetate, cyclohexanone, or any
other substance for the purpose of inducing a condition of
intoxication, stupefaction, depression, giddiness, paralysis
or irrational behavior, or in any manner changing,
distorting or disturbing the auditory, visual or mental
processes.  For the purposes of Section 712-1240 of Hawaii
Revised Statutes, any such condition so induced shall be
deemed to be an intoxicated condition.
(Emphasis added.)  On October 17, 2016, the circuit court granted
Garcia's "Motion to Dismiss Count 1 of Indictment for Lack of
Probable Cause" (Motion to Dismiss) because it concluded that AB-
FUBINACA was not an "intoxicating compound" under Section 712-
1240 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS).2
On appeal, the State contends that the circuit court
erred in:  (1) failing to make a finding of fact that AB-FUBINACA
is an "intoxicating compound" as the term would be commonly
understood; (2) concluding that "[t]he definition of
'intoxicating compound' in HRS § 712-1250(1) is identical to the
definition of 'intoxicating compound' in HRS § 712-1240;" and (3)
concluding that AB-FUBINACA was not an "intoxicating compound"
under HRS §§ 710-1022 and 712-1240.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we affirm.
(1)  The State argues that the circuit court erred in
ailing to make a finding of fact that AB-FUBINACA is an
intoxicating compound" as "that term would be commonly
nderstood."  However, we reject this argument, as Garcia was
harged under HRS § 710-1022,3 which limits the term f

(1) A person commits the offense of promoting prison

(a) The person intentionally conveys a dangerous

(b) Being a person confined in a correctional or

3"intoxicating compounds" to its definition under HRS § 712-1240.
(2)(3)  The State also argues that the circuit court
erred in concluding that "[t]he definition of 'intoxicating
compound' in HRS § 712-1250(1) is identical to the definition of
'intoxicating compound' in HRS § 712-1240," and thus, pursuant to
the holding in  State v. Kahalewai , 56 Haw. 481, 541 P.2d 1020
(1975), AB-FUBINACA was not an "intoxicating compound[]" under
HRS §§ 710-1022 and 712-1040.
HRS § 712-1240 (2014) defines "[i]ntoxicating
compounds" as:
[A]ny compound, liquid or chemical containing toluol,
hexane, trichloroethylene, acetone, toluene, ethyl acetate,
methyl ethyl ketone, trichloroethane, isopropanol, methyl
isobutyl ketone, methyl cellosolve acetate, cyclohexanone,
or any other substance for the purpose of inducing a
condition of intoxication, stupefaction, depression,
giddiness, paralysis or irrational behavior, or in any
manner changing, distorting or disturbing the auditory,
visual or mental processes.
HRS § 712-1250(1)(a) (2014) provides, in relevant part:
(1) A person commits the offense of promoting intoxicating
compounds if the person knowingly: 
(a) Breathes, inhales, or drinks any compound, liquid,
or chemical containing toluol, hexane, trichloroethylene,
acetone, toluene, ethyl acetate, methyl ethyl ketone,
trichloroethane, isopropanol, methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl
cellosolve acetate, cyclohexanone, or any other substance
for the purpose of inducing a condition of intoxication,
stupefaction, depression, giddiness, paralysis or irrational
behavior, or in any manner changing, distorting or
disturbing the auditory, visual or mental processes. 
(Emphasis added.)
The definition of "[i]ntoxicating compounds" under HRSNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
4§ 712-1240 is identical to the description of "intoxicating
compounds" under HRS § 712-1250(1)(a).
In Kahalewai, the Hawai# i Supreme Court applied the
statutory construction rule of  ejusdem generis in interpreting
the term "intoxicating compounds" under HRS § 712-1250(1)(a). 
The defendant in that case argued that the phrase "or any other
substance for the purpose of inducing a condition of
intoxication" found in HRS 712-1250(a)(1) resulted in an
overbroad definition of "intoxicating compounds" as it could
"prohibit the consumption of substances such as alcoholic
beverages, tobacco, and even coffee which contains caffeine." 
Id. at 486, 541 P.2d at 1024.  In rejecting the defendant's
argument, the supreme court explained:
Defendant's argument of overbreadth is based upon his
construction of Section 1250(1)(a) of the Hawaii Penal Code
to include alcohol, tobacco, coffee and numerous other
substances which could possibly affect a person's 'mental
processes.'  It appears to us that the legislature did not
intend to include those substances within this statute's
prohibition.  Under the defendant's interpretation, a person
may be confused as to what substances are regulated by
Section 1250(1)(a).  This seems to have been the concern of
the court below as appears from its query to the prosecutor: 
'How is a person to know?'
Because of the confusion generated by defendant's
construction of Section 1250(1)(a), Hawaii Penal Code, we
focus now upon the words of the statute to determine the
substances to which it does apply.  Grammatically, the
specific terms, 'toluol, hexane trichloroethylene, acetone,
toluene, ethyl acetate, methyl ethyl kotone,
trichloroethane, isopropanol, methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl
cellosolve acetate, (and) cyclohexanone' are all objects of
the participle 'containing.'  The general term 'any other
substance' follows those specific terms and is also an
object of the participle 'containing.'  The general term
'any other substance' is not a phrase separate from the
other objects of the participle 'containing.'  Therefore,
all the objects of that participle should be construed
together.
We recently stated in State v. Rackle, 55 Haw. 531, 534, 523
P.2d 299, 302 (1974):
'Where words of general description follow the
enumeration of certain things, those words are
restricted in their meaning to objects of like kind
and character with those specified. . . .  This is the
rule of ejusdem generis often utilized by the courts
in the construction of statutory law.  This doctrine
is especially applicable to penal statutes, which must
be strictly construed.'
Applying this rule, we held in Rackle that the term 'other
deadly or dangerous weapon,' as used in HRS s 134-51 (1973
Supp), preceded by the terms 'dirk, dagger, blackjack, slugNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
5(sic) shot, billy, metal knuckles, (and) pistol,' included
only instruments which were designed as offensive weapons
and  therefore could not include a flaregun designed as an
emergency signalling device.  We subsequently applied the
reasoning of Rackle to hold that a diver's knife is not a
'dangerous weapon.'  State v. Giltner, 56 Haw. 374, 537 P.2d
14 (1975).
Applying the rule of ejusdem generis to Section 1250(1)(a),
Hawaii Penal Code, we hold that the general term 'any other
substance' means any other substance similar to the
enumerated specific compounds which immediately precede the
general term.  All of the specific terms stated in Section
1250(1) (a) describe various violatile [sic] organic liquid
solvents commonly used, for example, in gasoline, glues,
cleaning fluid, and various types of paint.  None of the
specifically defined substances is used as a food or
beverage.  For purposes of illustration, tricholoroethylene,
acetone, and ethyl acetate are commonly used in varnish;
toluol, toluene, acetate, and ethyl acetate are commonly
used in lacquer; and, isopropanol and cyclohexanone are
commonly used in shellac.  See Robert H. Dreisbach, Handbook
of Poisoning (4th ed. 1963); The Merck Index (8th ed. 1968). 
Defendant has made no contention that alcoholic beverages,
tobacco, coffee or the other substances he has mentioned are
volatile organic liquid solvents and we have found no
authority to support such a contention.  Therefore, since
Section 1250(1)(a) as correctly interpreted applies only to
the stated classification, we decline to hold that the
substances mentioned by defendant are regulated by Section
1250(1)(a).
Id. at 487-89, 541 P.2d at 1025-26.  In other words, the supreme
court concluded that if a substance does not contain "toluol,
hexane, trichloroethylene, acetone, toluene, ethyl acetate,
methyl ethyl ketone, trichloroethane, isopropanol, methyl
isobutyl ketone, methyl cellosolve acetate, [or] cyclohexanone,"
in order to be considered an "intoxicating compound[]" under HRS
§ 712-1250(1)(a), the substance must contain "violatile [sic]
organic liquid solvents commonly used."  Id. at 489, 541 P.2d at
1026.
The Kahalewai  court's reasoning and interpretation of
HRS § 712-1250(1)(a) is directly applicable here in interpreting
the identical language of HRS § 712-1240 that defines
"[i]ntoxicating compounds."  Here, it is undisputed that AB-
FUBINACA does not contain toluol, hexane, trichloroethylene,
acetone, toluene, ethyl acetate, methyl ethyl ketone,
trichloroethane, isopropanol, methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl
cellosolve acetate, or cyclohexanone.  Therefore, in order for
AB-FUBINACA to be considered an "[i]ntoxicating compound[]" under
HRS § 712-1240, it must contain a volatile organic liquidNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
6solvent.  At the grand jury proceedings, Special Agent Shirley
Brown described AB-FUBINACA as a "synthetic cannabinoid," not a
volatile organic liquid solvent.  The State does not challenge
the circuit court's findings that AB-FUBINACA is not a volatile
organic liquid solvent.  Accordingly, we conclude that AB-
FUBINACA is not an "intoxicating compound[]" under HRS §§ 710-
1022 and 712-1240.
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the circuit court's 
"Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and Order Granting
Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Count 1 of the Indictment for Lack
of Probable Cause" entered on October 17, 2016.
