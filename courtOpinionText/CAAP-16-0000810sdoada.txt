IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I  
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v. 
MARK MEANS, also known as
MARK EDWARD MEANS, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 15-1-0811)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Ginoza, C.J., and Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Mark Means appeals from the
 
October 21, 2016 Judgment of Conviction and Sentence; Notice of
 
Entry ("Judgment") entered by the Circuit Court of the Second
 Circuit ("Circuit Court").
1/2/ Means was convicted by a jury of
 
Theft in the Second Degree, in violation of Hawaii Revised
 Statutes ("HRS") section 708-831(1)(b) (2014),
3/ and subsequently
 
sentenced as a repeat offender to a mandatory minimum of five
 years incarceration without the possibility of parole in addition
to other fees and fines. 
 
1/
 The Honorable Joseph E. Cardoza presided. 
2/
 The Judgment incorrectly reflects that Means entered a "GUILTY"
plea in the portion of the Judgment form labeled "DEFENDANT'S PLEA". As set
 
forth infra, we remand this case for correction of the error in the Judgment.
 
3/
 The statute provides, in relevant part, "A person commits the
offense of theft in the second degree if the person commits theft: . . . (b)
Of property or services the value of which exceeds $300[.]" Haw. Rev. Stat.
 § 708-831(1)(b). 
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
On appeal, Means alleges that (1) he was deprived of 
his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel; (2) 
the Circuit Court abused its discretion in allowing Sears Asset Protection Manager Arthur Wake to testify to the value of the subject merchandise and in receiving the printed Sears receipt ("Receipt") into evidence; and (3) the Circuit Court erred in sentencing Means as a repeat offender where the State failed to prove Means' prior convictions to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt in violation of State v. Auld, 136 Hawai' i 244, 361 P.3d 
471 (2015). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we affirm.
 
(1) In his first point of error, Means alleges that his
 
defense counsel was constitutionally ineffective because
 counsel's decision to adduce evidence that Means was homeless and
 unemployed had no relevance to the defense that Means did not
 possess the requisite state of mind as to the value of the stolen
 merchandise, and was highly prejudicial, resulting in the
 withdrawal or substantial impairment of a potentially meritorious
 defense. 
A defendant who raises a claim of ineffective 
assistance of counsel bears the burden of proving "1) that there were specific errors or omissions reflecting counsel's lack of skill, judgment, or diligence; and 2) that such errors or omissions resulted in either the withdrawal or substantial impairment of a potentially meritorious defense." State v. 
Richie, 88 Hawai' i 19, 39, 960 P.2d 1227, 1247 (1998) (quoting 
State v. Fukusaku, 85 Hawai' i 462, 480, 946 P.2d 32, 50 (1997)). 
"General claims of ineffectiveness are insufficient and every action or omission is not subject to inquiry." State v. 
Poaipuni, 98 Hawai' i 387, 392, 49 P.3d 353, 358 (2002) (quoting 
State v. Pacheco, 96 Hawai' i 83, 93, 26 P.3d 572, 582 (2001)). 
Counsel's allegedly erroneous actions or omissions "which had an obvious tactical basis for benefitting the defendant[']s case will not be subject to further scrutiny." Id. (emphasis omitted) 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
(quoting Pacheco, 96 Hawai' i at 93, 26 P.3d at 582). 
In furthering his defense that Means lacked the
 
requisite state of mind to steal merchandise with an aggregate
 
value of over $300, defense counsel stressed in closing that
 "[Means is] not an electronic calculator, and he's not a cash
 register. He's a homeless man who, apparently, went into Sears
 seeking shelter . . . [He] is a homeless man that is clearly
 taking a tent for whatever purpose he would -- a homeless person
 would take a tent." From this portrayal of Means as a homeless
 man seeking shelter and in need of a tent, it is apparent that
 counsel adduced the fact that Means was homeless as a trial
 strategy to evoke sympathy from the jury or to depict Means as
 someone who was attempting to satisfy a basic human need for
 shelter and who would not, therefore, have considered or known
 the price or value of the tent he was taking. 
Accordingly, this court will not second-guess defense 
counsel's apparent trial strategy of apprising the jury that defendant was homeless and unemployed and was in apparent need of shelter and a tent. See Poaipuni, 98 Hawai' i at 392, 49 P.3d at 
358 ("Specific actions or omissions alleged to be error but which had an obvious tactical basis for benefitting the defendants case will not be subject to further scrutiny." (emphasis omitted)); Richie, 88 Hawai' i at 39, 960 P.2d at 1247 ("[M]atters presumably 
within the judgment of counsel, like trial strategy, will rarely be second-guessed by judicial hindsight." (quoting State v. Smith, 68 Haw. 304, 311, 712 P.2d 496, 501 (1986))); accord State  
v. Faamama, No. CAAP-12-0000987, 2014 WL 2815493, at *1 (Hawai' i 
Ct. App. June 20, 2014). 
Therefore, Means was not deprived of his constitutional
 
right to effective assistance of counsel on the basis of defense
 counsel's soliciting testimony and later commenting in closing
 that Means was homeless and unemployed.
 
(2) In his second point of error, Means alleges that
 
the Circuit Court abused its discretion in allowing Wake to
 testify to the value of the stolen merchandise, both as reflected
 on the tags on the shelves and on the Receipt, and in receiving
 the Receipt into evidence, where the State failed to lay the
 
3
  
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
requisite foundation.
 
In theft cases, HRS section 708-830(8) (2014)
 
authorizes that proof of "[t]he unaltered price or name tag or
 
other marking on goods or merchandise, duly identified
 photographs or photocopies thereof, or printed register receipts
 shall be prima facie evidence of value and ownership of such
 goods or merchandise." Haw. Rev. Stat. § 708-830(8) (emphasis
 added).
4/ Here, the State produced the Receipt as evidence of
 
the aggregate value of the stolen merchandise. Wake was present
 when the stolen merchandise was scanned and the Receipt was
 generated, had personal knowledge of the pricing system as a
 former "consumer electronics associate" for Sears, and had been
 trained in the same procedure used to generate the Receipt. 
Wake testified that, per protocol, a manager, whom he could
 identify by "associate number," produced the Receipt with an
 "office register" which is used in complex returns and in
 generating receipts for theft. 
Means asserts that the State failed to lay the
 
requisite foundation to admit the Receipt under HRS section 708­
4/
 Stated in full, the relevant subsection of the statute provides:
 
A person commits theft if the person does any of the
 
following:
 
. . . .
 (8)	 Shoplifting.
 (a)	 A person conceals or takes possession of the goods or
merchandise of any store or retail establishment, with
intent to defraud.
 
. . . .
 
The unaltered price or name tag or other marking on
goods or merchandise, duly identified photographs or
photocopies thereof, or printed register receipts shall
be prima facie evidence of value and ownership of such
goods or merchandise . Photographs of the goods or
 
merchandise involved, duly identified in writing by the
arresting police officer as accurately representing such
goods or merchandise, shall be deemed competent evidence
of the goods or merchandise involved and shall be
 admissible in any proceedings, hearings, and trials for
shoplifting to the same extent as the goods or
 merchandise themselves.
 
Haw. Rev. Stat. § 708-830(8)(a) (emphasis added).

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
830(8). To this end, Means appears to equate the analysis for a
 
purported-"printed register receipt" with the analysis for the
 business records exception to hearsay. Means, however, fails to
 establish that the Receipt's admissibility as a "printed register
 receipt" is contingent upon its admissibility under the business
 records exception, and does not argue on appeal that the Receipt
 itself is hearsay. Moreover, neither the parties nor the Circuit
 Court discussed whether the Receipt was a "business record" in
 the proceedings below. Accordingly, Means fails to show that the
 Circuit Court abused its discretion in receiving the Receipt into
 evidence as a "printed register receipt" under HRS section 708­830(8).
 
(3) In his final point of error, Means alleges that the 
Circuit Court erred in sentencing him as a repeat offender because the State failed to prove his prior convictions to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt pursuant to Auld, 136 Hawai' i 244, 361 
P.3d 471. Means argues that the prospective holding in Auld applies to the instant case because his sentencing proceeding was the "triggering 'event'" and therefore the Circuit Court's failure to require that the State prove Means' prior convictions to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt violated his due process rights under the Hawai' i Constitution. 
Means misidentifies the triggering event. See State v. 
Hopu, No. CAAP-17-0000210, 2018 WL 1871077, at *1 (Hawai' i Ct. 
App. Apr. 19, 2018), cert. denied 2018 WL 4692332 (Hawai' i 
Oct. 1, 2018) (Hopu was sentenced after Auld was issued. Nevertheless, "Hopu's Felony Information was filed on February 4, 2014, and the Auld decision was filed on November 24, 2015. Therefore, Auld does not apply to Hopu's case."). Means' Felony Information was filed on September 8, 2015, more than two months before Auld was issued. Accordingly, Auld does not apply to this case. The Circuit Court, therefore, did not err in sentencing Means as a repeat offender without requiring the State to prove Means' prior convictions to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the October 21,
 
2016 Judgment of Conviction and Sentence; Notice of Entry entered
 by the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit is affirmed, except
