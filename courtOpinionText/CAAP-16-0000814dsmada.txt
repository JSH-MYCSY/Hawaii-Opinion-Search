APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 13-1-2827)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
appellate jurisdiction over the appeal of Plaintiff-Appellant
 
Genghis Kaihewalu (Kaihewalu) from the Honorable Edwin C.
 Nacino's September 22, 2016 Judgment because the September 22,
 2016 Judgment neither resolves all claims nor contains a finding
 of no just reason for delay in the entry of judgment as to one or
 more but fewer than all claims or parties pursuant to Rule 54(b)
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of the Hawai 'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP), as Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS) 641-1(a) (2016 Repl.) requires for an appealable 
final judgment under HRCP Rule 58 and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 
1334, 1338 (1994). 
When a party attempts to assert an appeal from a civil 
circuit court case, HRS § 641-1(a) and HRCP Rule 58 require that such an "appeal may be taken from circuit court orders resolving claims against parties only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i at 119, 869 
P.2d at 1338 (emphasis added). "Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai
'i 245, 
254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008); Bailey v. DuVauchelle, 135 Hawai
'i 482, 489, 353 P.3d 1024, 1031 (2015). Furthermore, "an 
appeal from any judgment will be dismissed as premature if the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & 
Wright, 76 Hawai
'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. "An appeal from an 
order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Id. at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote omitted). 
The September 22, 2016 Judgment neither resolves all 
claims against all parties nor contains the finding necessary for certification under HRCP Rule 54(b). The September 22, 2016 Judgment enters judgment in favor of Defendants-Third-Party Plaintiffs-Appellees Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism, and Hawai
'i Housing Finance and Development 
Corporation (collectively, State) and against Kaihewalu as to Kaihewalu's complaint. However, the September 22, 2016 Judgment 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
does not enter judgment on or dismiss the State's first amended
 
third-party complaint.
 
We recognize that the July 25, 2016 stipulation to 
dismiss the State's third-party complaint purports to dismiss all claims by the State against the third-party defendants, and the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i holds that where all parties sign the 
stipulation to dismiss without an order of the court pursuant to HRCP Rule 41(a)(1)(B), "a separate judgment is neither required nor authorized, inasmuch as a plaintiff’s dismissal of an action, by filing a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties [pursuant to HRCP Rule 41(a)(1)(B)], is effective without order of the court." Amantiad v. Odum, 90 Hawai
'i 152, 158 n.7, 977 
P.2d 160, 166 n.7 (1999) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). However, the parties have failed to comply with the express requirement under HRCP Rule 41(a)(1)(B) that any stipulation to dismiss must be "signed by all parties who have appeared in the action": 
Rule 41. Dismissal of actions.
 
(a) Voluntary dismissal: Effect thereof.
 
(1) By plaintiff; by stipulation. An action may
be dismissed by the plaintiff without order of court (A) by
filing a notice of dismissal at any time before the return
date as provided in Rule 12(a) or service by the adverse
party of an answer or of a motion for summary judgment, or
(B) by filing a stipulation of dismissal signed by all
parties who have appeared in the action, in the manner and
form prescribed by Rule 41.1 of these rules. Unless
 otherwise stated in the notice of dismissal or stipulation,
the dismissal is without prejudice, except that a notice of
dismissal operates as an adjudication upon the merits when
filed by a plaintiff who has once dismissed in any court of
the United States, or of any state, territory or insular
possession of the United States an action based on or
including the same claim.
 
(Emphases added). 
The Supreme Court of Hawai 'i has acknowledged that the 
HRCP Rule 41(a) provisions regarding voluntary dismissals are 
very similar to the provisions in the federal counterpart, Hawai
'i District Court Rules of Civil Procedure (HDCRCP) Rule 
41(a). See, e.g., Tagupa v. Vipdesk, 135 Hawai 'i 468, 476, 353 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
P.3d 1010, 1018 (2015) ("Since HDCRCP Rule 41(a)(2) is identical
 
to HRCP Rule 41(a)(2) (2012) and essentially identical to FRCP
 [(Federal Rules of Civil Procedure)] Rule 41(a)(2) (2010), cases
 interpreting and applying HRCP Rule 41(a)(2) and FRCP Rule
 41(a)(2) may be consulted for guidance in interpreting HDCRCP
 Rule 41(a)(2)."). When parties in a federal case stipulate to
 dismiss an action pursuant to FRCP Rule 41(a)(1)(A)(ii), "a
 stipulation that purports to dismiss the entire action without
 the consent of all parties may be deemed ineffective." 8 James
 Wm. Moore et al., Moores Federal Practice § 41.34[4][b], at 41­115 (3d ed. 2009) (footnote omitted); see, e.g., Alholm American
 Steamship Co., 167 F.R.D. 75, 79-80 (D. Minn. 1996) (Ruling that
 a stipulation to dismiss under FRCP Rule 41(a) was ineffective
 where "the pertinent Stipulation fails to conform the requisites
 of the Rule, because [two of the three named] Defendants have not
 been joined in its execution."). In the instant case, Kaihewalu
 did not sign the July 25, 2016 stipulation to dismiss, despite
 that Kaihewalu was the plaintiff in the underlying action and
 indisputably appeared in this case. Therefore, the July 25, 2016
 stipulation to dismiss does not satisfy the requirements under
 HRCP Rule 41(a)(1)(B). 
Absent an appealable final judgment, we lack appellate
 
jurisdiction over appellate court case number CAAP-16-0000814. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED AND DECREED that
 
appellate court case number CAAP-16-0000814 is dismissed for lack
 of appellate jurisdiction.
