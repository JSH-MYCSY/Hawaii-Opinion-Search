IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 12-1-0862)

 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR FAILURE TO FILE OPENING BRIEF
 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, and Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Upon review of the record, it appears that:
 
(1) On November 17, 2016, Defendants-Appellants 
Leonida F. Chang (Chang) and Jose-Rizal B. Viernes (Viernes) "by 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
[Chang], Attorney-in-Fact for [Viernes]" (collectively,
 
Appellants), filed a notice of appeal pro se;1
 
(2) On January 16, 2017, the circuit court clerk filed
 
the record on appeal, which indicates Appellants were represented
 in the underlying case, Civil No. 12-1-0862, by William H.
 Gilardy, Jr. (Counsel). There is no order or motion for
 withdrawal of counsel, or withdrawal and substitution of counsel,
 filed here or in the underlying case;
 
(3) On January 17, 2017, the appellate clerk notified
 
the parties, including Counsel, that, among other things, the
 opening brief was due on or before February 27, 2017;
 
(4) A bankruptcy stay was in effect for this appeal 
from January 25, 2017, through March 23, 2017. Pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 54(a), which is 
self-executing, the opening brief was due forty days after the bankruptcy stay was lifted. Thus, the opening brief was due on or before May 2, 2017; 
(5) Appellants did not file the opening brief or
 
request an extension of time;
 
(6) On May 4, 2017, the appellate clerk notified
 
Appellants and Counsel that the time for filing the opening brief
 had expired, the matter would be called to the court's attention
 on May 15, 2017, for appropriate action, which could include
 dismissal of the appeal, pursuant to HRAP Rule 30, and Appellants
 may request relief from default by motion; and
 
(7) Neither Appellants pro se nor Counsel took further
 
action in this appeal.
 
1/ It apears that Chang is not licensed to practice law in Hawai' i, and
Appellants cite no authority and provide no documentation to support the
assertion that she is authorized to appear as “Attorney-in-Fact” for Viernes.See HRS §§ 605-2, 605-14 & 605-17 (governing unauthorized practice of law).At this time, the court does not determine whether Chang may appear forViernes, or Chang lawfully executed the notice of appeal for Viernes.
