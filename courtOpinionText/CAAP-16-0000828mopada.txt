APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD 
MEMORANDUM OPINION 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Claimant-Appellant Kate X. Cui (Cui) appeals from the 
October 26, 2016 "Decision and Order" (October 26, 2016 Order) 
entered by the State of Hawai# i Labor and Industrial Relations 
Appeals Board (LIRAB). 
On appeal, Cui contends that the LIRAB erred when it: 
(1) affirmed the July 1, 2011 and June 6, 2013 decisions of the Director of Labor and Industrial Relations, Disability 
Compensation Division (Director) in LIRAB Case No. AB 2011-NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
206/DCD No. 2-09-40756, as LIRAB held that the Director reserved 
the question of whether Cui's Major Depressive Disorder was 
related to her August 3, 2009 work injury and declined to address 
that issue; and (2) reversed the Director's June 6, 2013 decision 
in LIRAB Case No. AB 2013-232/DCD No. 2-12-40661, as LIRAB held 
that Cui's claim filed on August 28, 2012 for a March 25, 2010 
Major Depressive Disorder injury was time-barred and declined to 
address the merits of the claim. 
Employer-Appellee State of Hawai# i, Department of 
Health (Employer) is appellee in this matter as it pertains to 
LIRAB Case No. AB 2011-206/DCD No. 2-09-40756. Employer and 
Adjuster-Appellee State of Hawai
#i, Department of Human Resources 
Development (Adjuster) (collectively, Employer-Adjuster) are both appellees in this matter as it pertains to LIRAB Case No. AB 
2013-232/DCD No. 2-12-40661. 
I. BACKGROUND 
A. Cui's First Workers' Compensation Claim - LIRAB Case No. AB
2011-206/DCD No. 2-09-40756 
On September 22, 2009, Cui filed a claim for workers' 
compensation benefits for an Adjustment Disorder with Mixed 
Anxiety and Depressed Mood, which she alleged she sustained on 
August 17, 2009 (WC Claim 1). Cui claimed that her injury arose 
as the result of abnormal and excessive work pressure due to 
understaffing, disrespectful and unprofessional treatment, and 
work performance criticisms from her then supervisor. 
On April 22, 2010, the Director determined, inter alia, 
that Cui's WC Claim 1 was a work injury that resulted in an Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood. 
It 
was further agreed by Cui, Employer, and Adjuster, as Employer's representative, that the correct date of injury was August 3, 
2009, and that Employer voluntarily accepted liability for the 
particular injury. Neither party appealed this decision. 
2          NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Cui was terminated from her position with Employer on 
March 25, 2010. 
On March 7, 2011, Adjuster, as Employer's 
representative, sent notice to Cui that it would be terminating 
her temporary total disability benefits for WC Claim 1 on 
March 21, 2011, based on its determination that Cui's current 
diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder resulted from her 
termination and not her WC Claim 1 work injury. 
In a July 1, 2011 decision, the Director determined, 
inter alia, that Employer was justified in terminating Cui's 
temporary total disability benefits from WC Claim 1, as Cui's 
Major Depressive Disorder condition resulted after termination 
and was no longer the result of the WC Claim 1 work injury. Cui 
appealed the Director's July 1, 2011 decision to the LIRAB on 
July 11, 2011. 
On August 10, 2012, Cui moved to temporarily remand the 
case to the Director on the assertion that Cui would file an 
amended WC-5 Form listing Major Depressive Disorder as an 
additional injury in WC Claim 1 and, out of an abundance of 
caution, also file a new, separate WC-5 Form alternatively 
alleging that her Major Depressive Disorder resulted from her 
March 25, 2010 termination. The LIRAB granted the motion on 
August 16, 2012, and temporarily remanded the case to the 
Director to "address [the] compensability of a claim to be filed 
by Claimant for Major Depressive Disorder and for determination 
of any other issue the Director deems appropriate." 
The issue on remand was heard at a May 2, 2013 
hearing.1 Cui appears to have not filed an amended WC-5 Form 
listing Major Depressive Disorder as an additional injury stemming from her August 3, 2009 injury until May 3, 2013 
1 The record does not contain a transcript of this hearing.

      NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(Amended WC Claim 1).2 However, Cui did file a new, separate 
WC-5 Form on August 28, 2012, alleging Major Depressive Disorder 
resulting from the March 25, 2010 termination, initiating LIRAB 
Case No. AB 2013-232/DCD No. 2-12-40661 (WC Claim 2). The 
Director apparently disregarded the post-hearing filing of the 
Amended WC Claim 1 and held in her June 6, 2013 decision in WC 
Claim 1 that "the Director is unable to make a determination on 
the compensability of claimant's Major Depressive Disorder" as 
related to Cui's August 3, 2009 injury because "[t]he record is 
absent of a written claim from claimant for a Major Depressive 
Disorder." The Director thus deferred the determination of 
compensability of Cui's Major Depressive Disorder in WC Claim 1. 
Cui subsequently appealed the Director's June 6, 2013 decision in 
WC Claim 1 to the LIRAB on June 24, 2013. 
B. Cui's Second Workers' Compensation Claim - Case No. AB 2013-
232 (DCD No. 2-12-40661) 
On August 28, 2012, Cui filed WC Claim 2 as a new, 
separate claim alleging Major Depressive Disorder resulting from 
the March 25, 2010 termination of her employment. 
In a separate June 6, 2013 decision in WC Claim 2, the 
Director waived the statute of limitations set forth in Hawaii 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 386-82 (2015) in light of the confusing 
nature of Cui's psychological situation and held, inter alia, 
that Cui sustained a compensable work injury of Major Depressive 
2 The only two Amended WC-5 Forms in the record are both date stamped
May 1, 2013, apparently filed under LIRAB Case No. AB 2013-232/DCD No. 2-12-40661
(WC Claim 2), and list an injury of "Major Depressive Disorder; AdjustmentDisorder with Anxiety and Depressed Mood and Major Depression," with the date ofaccident as March 25, 2010, and the date of disability as August 3, 2009.However, in Cui's opening brief, she states that she filed the Amended WC-5 Formsfor WC Claim 1 on May 3, 2013, to address Employer-Adjuster's objections thatthere was no claim for Major Depressive Disorder in the record. In an October 31, 2014 post-trial brief, Employer-Adjuster also refers to an AmendedWC-5 Form filed May 3, 2013. Upon our review of the record, we find no other Amended WC-5 Forms. It is unclear whether these are the Amended WC-5 Forms beingreferred to, since the March 25, 2010 date of accident and May 1, 2013 date stampwould indicate otherwise. Because both parties concede that Amended WC-5 Formswere filed on May 3, 2013 alleging an injury of Major Depressive Disorderresulting from the August 3, 2009 work injury, we assume such an Amended WC-5Form was filed on May 3, 2013.

Disorder as a result of her termination from employment on 
March 25, 2010. 
Employer-Adjuster appealed the Director's June 6, 2013 
decision in WC Claim 2 to the LIRAB on June 25, 2013. 
On October 21, 2013, the parties stipulated to 
consolidate the cases for WC Claim 1 and WC Claim 2. 
C. The LIRAB's October 26, 2016 Order 
The LIRAB's October 26, 2016 Order was a decision and 
order on the consolidated appeals of the Director's July 1, 2011 
and June 6, 2013 decisions in WC Claim 1, and the Director's 
June 6, 2013 decision in WC Claim 2. 
In its October 26, 2016 Order, the LIRAB affirmed the 
July 1, 2011 and June 6, 2013 decisions of the Director and held 
that it would not make a determination on whether Cui's current 
Major Depressive Disorder is related to her previously accepted 
WC Claim 1 work injury for Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety 
and Depressed Mood because the issue was reserved by the Director 
in her June 6, 2013 decision in WC Claim 1. 
The LIRAB also reversed the Director's separate June 6, 
2013 determination in WC Claim 2, wherein the Director determined 
that Cui's Major Depressive Disorder was a compensable work 
injury that resulted from her termination from employment on 
March 25, 2010. The LIRAB reversed the Director's decision on 
the basis that Cui's filing of her WC Claim 2 on August 28, 2012, 
which alleged a work injury of Major Depressive Disorder 
sustained on March 25, 2010, was time-barred and declined to 
address the merits of WC Claim 2. 
On November 22, 2016, Cui filed a timely notice of 
appeal to this court appealing the LIRAB's October 26, 2016 
Order. 
II. POINTS OF ERROR 
On appeal, Cui asserts that the LIRAB erred in its 
October 26, 2016 Order on the basis that: (1) Findings of Fact 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(FOFs) 57, 60, 65, 66, 70, 74, 79-88, 91, and 92 are clearly 
erroneous; (2) Conclusions of Law (COLs) 1-3 were erroneous as a 
matter of law; and (3) the LIRAB's decision was otherwise made 
upon unlawful procedure, or was arbitrary, capricious, or 
characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted 
exercise of discretion. 
III. STANDARD OF REVIEW 
Appellate review of a LIRAB decision is governed by HRS 
§ 91–14(g). Igawa v. Koa House Rest., 97 Hawai# i 402, 405–06, 38 
P.3d 570, 573–74 (2001). At the time of the LIRAB's decision, HRS § 91-14(g) provided:

IV. DISCUSSION 
A. FOFs 57, 60, 65, 66, 70, 74, and 80 are not clearly
erroneous. 
Cui argues that the challenged FOFs are "clearly 
erroneous both because they are inconsistent with the record as a 
whole but because they are also inconsistent with the Board's own 
other specific findings of fact." Cui more specifically contends 
that the FOFs are inconsistent with FOFs 7, 36, 37, and 41, and 
appears to contend that they are also inconsistent with FOFs 59, 
70, and 71.3 
3 FOFs 7, 36, 37, 41, 59, 70, and 71 are as follows: 
7. According to Claimant's testimony, she did not
believe that she sustained a new injury after her termination
and did not know that she needed to file a second claim. Claimant believed that her symptoms continued to be related toher August 3, 2009 case. However, she later filed anotherclaim for a March 25, 2010 work injury at the suggestion ofher attorney. 
36
. Claimant testified that she was not surprised to
get the March 22, 2010 termination letter and that she was notafraid to lose her job, because she knew she would be firedwhen she received the [Notice To Improve Performance].
37. Claimant testified that her psychological condition
started in July 2009 and continued to worsen over time, butthat there was no change in her symptoms after she receivedthe March 22, 2010 letter. 
 
41. On March 27, 2010, Dr. Ponce noted that Claimant
seemed to be in a "good space" and that a trip to China woulddo her a lot of good. 
59
. In a May 2, 2011 report, Dr. Ponce disagreed with
Dr. Streltzer's opinion that Claimant's Major Depression wasdue to her termination. Rather, Dr. Ponce stated thatClaimant was first diagnosed with Major Depression four monthsafter she was notified of her termination but that she was already depressed before her March 25, 2010 termination. 
70
. [Dr. Ponce] understood that around March 2010,
Claimant received a letter that her position had beenterminated. From March to June 2010, Claimant decompensatedand there was a noticeable downward spiral. Dr. Ponce stated that he did not inform Claimant that he had changed hisdiagnosis.
71. Dr. Ponce explained that the change in his
diagnosis was a matter of degree; he believed that whether

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In FOFs 57, 60, 65, and 66, the LIRAB found: 
57. Dr. Streltzer prepared a supplemental report
dated October 28, 2010, following his review of additional
records, wherein he opined that Claimant's AdjustmentDisorder, had not resolved and worsened into a MajorDepressive Disorder with a decreased level of functioning,because she was fired from her job on March 25, 2010. He further opined that Claimant would have been able tocontinue in her usual and customary duties withoutpsychiatric impairment, had she not been terminated.
. . . . 60. Joseph P. Rogers, Ph.D., a psychologist, examined
Claimant at Employer's request. In his May 21, 2012 report,Dr. Rogers diagnosed Claimant with a Major DepressiveDisorder, Current Status Unknown Due to SymptomMagnification, and agreed with Dr. Streltzer that Claimant'sAdjustment Disorder worsened into a Major DepressiveDisorder because of her March 25, 2010 termination. 
. . . . 65. Dr. Zichittella opined that Claimant's August 3,
2009 work injury was permanent and stable and deferred toDr. Roger's permanent impairment rating and apportionmentwith regard to the August 3, 2009 work injury. He also agreed with Dr. Rogers's assessment that Claimant would havecontinued her full employment if she had not beenterminated. 
66. However, Dr. Zichittella also stated that, with
regard to the March 25, 2010 work injury claim, Claimant had3% permanent impairment of the whole person, all due topreexisting psychological factors. 
FOFs 57, 60, 65, and 66 are merely summaries of Dr. 
Streltzer's, Dr. Rogers', and Dr. Zichitellas' respective reports 
and opinions contained in the record. Although the doctors' 
opinions may be inconsistent with Cui and Dr. Ponce's perceptions 
and opinions on the etiology and status of Cui's condition, as 
reflected in FOFs 7, 36, 37, 41, 59, 70, and 71, they are 
accurate reflections of the respective doctors' reports and 
opinions. Accordingly, FOFs 57, 60, 65, and 66 are not clearly 
erroneous. See Igawa, 97 Hawai# i at 405–06, 38 P.3d at 573–74. 
Similarly, FOF 70, which stated 
70. [Dr. Ponce] understood that around March 2010, 
Claimant had an Adjustment Disorder or Major Depression was a
matter of semantics. He also believed that, in retrospect,Claimant could have been diagnosed with a major depressionfrom the beginning.

is not clearly erroneous because it is an accurate reflection of 
Dr. Ponce's August 26, 2014 testimony. See id. at 405–06, 38 
P.3d at 573–74. 
In FOF 80, the LIRAB found: 
Leading up to Dr. Ponce's diagnosis of Major Depressive
Disorder on June 1, 2010, the record on appeal evidencesthat Claimant reported a worsening of her symptoms as earlyas December 5, 2009, after she was verbally notified of hertermination. On that date, Dr. Ponce noted that Claimanthad "spiraling depression/anxiety" after being informed ofher termination. Thereafter, he noted that the reality ofher termination was sinking in. Also, the frequency of hervisits had increased. On February 22, 2010, Claimant sawDr. Ponce in an urgent session for a panic attack, relatedto the reality of her termination. On May 29, 2010, Dr.Ponce noted that Claimant had "continuing excessiveworrying, jitteriness & depression" because awareness of hertermination was finally sinking in. On June 1, 2010, Dr.Ponce submitted a treatment plan with a diagnosis of MajorDepressive Disorder. Also, Claimant testified that duringthe one month before her termination, she forced herself towork but did not function well in her job and that hercondition worsened over time. Dr. Ponce's records further indicate that Claimant attributed her condition, at least inpart, to her eventual termination. 
FOF 80 appears to be a reiteration of FOFs 27, 28, 32, 40, 46, 
and 47.  FOFs 27, 32, and 46 are accurate reflections of Dr. 4
4 FOFs 27, 28, 32, 40, 46, and 47 state: 
27. On December 5, 2009, Dr. Ponce noted that
Claimant had "spiraling depression/anxiety" after being
verbally informed her employment would be terminated.
28. Claimant testified that for one month before her 
March 25, 2010 termination, she forced herself to work, butdid not function well in her job. . . . 
. . . . 32. On February 22, 2010, Claimant saw Dr. Ponce in
an urgent treatment session for a "panic attack." Dr. Ponce noted that the reality of being fired was sinking in.
. . . . 40. Between her receipt of Employer's February 8,
2010 letter and her termination on March 25, 2010, Claimantsaw Dr. Ponce six times for individual and/or family therapysessions. 
. . . . 46. On May 29, 2010, Dr. Ponce noted that Claimant
had "continuing excessive worrying, jitteriness &

Ponce's notes in Cui's psychiatric progress reports for: 
December 5, 2009; February 22, 2010; and May 29, 2010. FOF 28 is 
an accurate reflection of Cui's August 26, 2014 testimony. FOF 40 
is sufficiently supported by Cui's psychiatric progress reports, 
which lists sessions 13 through 18 with Dr. Ponce as occurring on 
February 20, 2010 through March 13, 2010. FOF 47 is reflected in 
Dr. Ponce's June 1, 2010 treatment plan for Cui. Accordingly, 
FOFs 27, 28, 32, 40, 46, 47, and 80 are not clearly erroneous. 
See Igawa, 97 Hawai# i at 405–06, 38 P.3d at 573–74. 
Cui next contends that the LIRAB erred in FOF 74, which 
states: 
74. The Board does not credit Dr. Ponce's opinion
that Claimant could have qualified for a Major Depressive
Disorder diagnosis from the beginning of her claim. The record on appeal indicates that Claimant's symptoms appearedto deteriorate after she was verbally informed of hertermination. Dr. Ponce's notes documented that Claimant "slipped" or deteriorated into the Major Depressive Disorderover several months and, contrary to his testimony, thesymptoms he attributed to his diagnosis of a MajorDepressive Disorder were not present from the beginning. 
It is well established that: 
courts decline to consider the weight of the evidence toascertain whether it weighs in favor of the administrativefindings, or to review the agency's findings of fact bypassing upon the credibility of witnesses or conflicts intestimony, especially the findings of an expert agencydealing with a specialized field. 
Igawa, 97 Hawai# i at 410, 38 P.3d at 578 (quoting In re 
Application of Hawaiian Elec. Co., Inc., 81 Hawai# i 459, 465, 918 
P.2d 561, 567 (1996)). In a worker's compensation case, the 
"credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given their 
testimony are within the province of the trier of fact and, 
generally, will not be disturbed on appeal."

depression" because awareness of her termination was finally
sinking in.
47. Dr. Ponce submitted a June 1, 2010 treatment plan
noting a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder. . . . 
10 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2001) (citation omitted). 
The LIRAB's FOFs 27, 46, 47, 49, 51, and 53 indicate 
that Dr. Ponce noted: on December 5, 2009, that Cui had spiraling 
depression/anxiety after being verbally informed her employment 
would be terminated (FOF 27); on May 29, 2010, that Cui had 
continuing excessive worrying, jitteriness and depression because 
awareness of her termination was finally sinking in (FOF 46); on 
June 1, 2010, that he diagnosed Cui with Major Depressive 
Disorder as Cui was exhibiting symptoms of major depression (FOF 
47); on June 12, 2010, that Cui was slipping into a major 
depression (FOF 49); on August 21, 2010, that Cui was in the 
throes of a major depression (FOF 51); and on September 11, 2010, 
that Cui had slipped into a Major Depressive Disorder (FOF 53). 
Further, in Dr. Ponce's June 12, 2010 notes, Dr. Ponce indicated 
that Cui was "[i]ncreasingly complaining of symptoms indicating 
that she is indeed slipping into a 'Major Depression'" and that 
she had "[i]ncreased frequency of suicidal ruminations[.]" As 
stated previously, FOFs 27, 46, and 47 are not clearly erroneous. 
Additionally, insofar as FOFs 49, 51, and 53 have not been 
challenged on appeal, they are binding on this court. Kelly v. 
1250 Oceanside Partners, 111 Hawai# i 205, 227, 140 P.3d 985, 1007 
(2006) (citation omitted). These unchallenged FOFs and the record substantiate the LIRAB's finding that Cui's symptoms 
appear to have deteriorated from her original diagnosis into 
Major Depressive Disorder over several months after being 
verbally informed that she would be terminated. 
As a result, FOF 
74 is supported by the record and is not clearly erroneous. See Igawa, 97 Hawai# i at 405–06, 38 P.3d at 573–74. Additionally, it 
is within the LIRAB's discretion to decide what weight, if any, to give Dr. Ponce's testimony. See Tamashiro, 97 Hawai# i at 92, 
34 P.3d at 22; cf De Victoria v. H & K Contractors, 56 Haw. 552, 559, 545 P.2d 692, 698 (1976) (holding that "[t]he issue of 
credibility is one within the primary responsibility of the Board 
11 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
as the fact finder whose determination will not be disturbed 
lightly. But where the record reveals no conflict in the 
evidence or impeachment of any witness, the court will not 
sustain a finding as to credibility which it is firmly convinced 
is mistaken." (citations omitted)). This court declines to 
disturb FOF 74 and the LIRAB's assessment of the credibility of 
the witness and the weight it gave to the evidence. 
B. The LIRAB did not err in FOFs 79-83 and COLs 1 and 2, by
determining that Cui's WC Claim 2 was untimely pursuant toHRS § 386-82. 
Cui challenges FOFs 79-83 and COLs 1 and 2, arguing 
that the LIRAB erred in determining that her WC Claim 2 filed on 
August 28, 2012, alleging a March 25, 2010 work injury, was filed 
outside of the two-year statute of limitation of HRS § 386-82 and 
that the LIRAB's determination was contrary to Demond v. 
University of Hawaii, 54 Hawai# i 98, 503 P.2d 434 (1972). 
In applicable part, HRS § 386-82 provides: 
§386-82 Claim for compensation; limitation of time.
The right to compensation under this chapter shall be barred
unless a written claim therefor is made to the director of labor and industrial relations[:]
(1) Within two years after the date at which theeffects of the injury for which the employee isentitled to compensation have become manifest;and 
(2) Within five years after the date of the accidentor occurrence which caused the injury. 
In this case, there is no contention that Cui's WC 
Claim 2 was not filed "[w]ithin five years after the date of the 
accident or occurrence which caused the injury." See HRS 
§ 386-82(2). Therefore, the only timeliness issue on appeal is 
whether Cui's WC Claim 2 was within the two-year statute of 
limitations under HRS § 386-82(1). As pertaining to HRS § 386-
82(1), the supreme court has held that "the two-year statute of 
limitations for the filing of a workers' compensation claim 
begins to accrue when the claimant's injury becomes manifest, as 
set forth under Demond." Hayashi v. Scott Co., 93 Hawai# i 8, 12, 
994 P.2d 1054, 1058 (2000). "In Demond, [the supreme] court 
12          
            
            NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
. . . held that 'the time period for notice or claim does not 
begin to run until the claimant, as a reasonable person, should 
recognize the nature, seriousness and probable compensable 
character of his injury or disease.'" Id. (citations and 
original brackets omitted) (quoting Demond, 54 Hawai# i at 104, 
503 P.2d at 438). 
In FOFs 79-83, the LIRAB determined that Cui's WC 2 
Claim was untimely, as follows: 
79. The Board finds that the effect of Claimant's 
Major Depressive Disorder, as it may be related to a
March 25, 2010 accident date, manifested by June 1, 2010.
80. Leading up to Dr. Ponce's diagnosis of Major
Depressive Disorder on June 1, 2010, the record on appealevidences that Claimant reported a worsening of her symptomsas early as December 5, 2009, after she was verballynotified of her termination. On that date, Dr. Ponce notedthat Claimant had "spiraling depression/anxiety" after beinginformed of her termination. Thereafter, he noted that thereality of her termination was sinking in. Also, thefrequency of her visits had increased. On February 22,2010, Claimant saw Dr. Ponce in an urgent session for apanic attack, related to the reality of her termination. On May 29, 2010, Dr. Ponce noted that Claimant had "continuingexcessive worrying, jitteriness & depression" becauseawareness of her termination was finally sinking in. On June 1, 2010, Dr. Ponce submitted a treatment plan with adiagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder. Also, Claimanttestified that during the one month before her termination,she forced herself to work but did not function well in her job and that her condition worsened over time. Dr. Ponce's records further indicate that Claimant attributed her condition, at least in part, to her eventual termination.
81. The Board finds that Claimant knew or should have 
known the nature, seriousness and probable compensablecharacter of her psychological condition within days afterJune 1, 2010.
82. Claimant's WC-5 was filed on August 28, 2012 -
more than two years after June 1, 2010 - the date heralleged March 25, 2010 work accident became manifest.
83. The Board finds that Claimant's August 28,
201[2]
[5] written claim for a March 25, 2010 work accident
was untimely. 
The LIRAB further determined in COL 1 that "Claimant's 
claim filed on August 28, 2012 was time-barred by the two-year 
statue of limitations set forth under Section 386-82, H.R.S. (AB 
5 The referenced date of Claimant's written claim was corrected from 
"August 28, 2010" to "August 28, 2012" by "Order Granting Employer's Motion for
Correction of Decision and Order Filed October 26, 2016," filed on November 16,2016. 
13 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2013-232)" on the basis that "[t]he effects of Claimant's Major 
Depressive Disorder manifested by June 1, 2010, and by that date, 
Claimant knew or should have known of the nature, seriousness and 
probable compensable character of her psychological condition." 
The LIRAB also determined in COL 2 that, since Cui's WC Claim 2 
was time-barred, the LIRAB would not determine the merits of 
Cui's WC Claim 2 in terms of whether it was compensable and if 
compensable, the extent of permanent partial disability that 
resulted from that work injury. 
Cui contends that the LIRAB erred in finding and 
concluding that her WC Claim 2 filed on August 28, 2012 was time-
barred under HRS § 386-82(1) because Cui did not and should not 
have reasonably recognized the probable compensable character of 
her Major Depressive Disorder on or about June 1, 2010. Cui does 
not appear to challenge the timing of when she recognized the 
nature or seriousness of her claimed injury. Cui supports her 
position by arguing that she did not recognize that she had 
suffered a new injury, as she testified that "[f]or my knowledge, 
I don't know this is separate case. I never thought about it's 
going to be a separate case. I always think this is one case." 
Cui also puts forth several plausible dates for when a reasonable 
person should have recognized the compensable character of Cui's 
Major Depressive Disorder. 
The LIRAB made its determination that Cui's Major 
Depressive Disorder manifested on June 1, 2010, or within days 
thereafter, primarily based on Dr. Ponce's June 1, 2010 treatment 
plan that diagnosed Cui with Major Depressive Disorder and Cui's 
declining condition prior to the issuance of that diagnosis. 
Leading up to Dr. Ponce's June 1, 2010 diagnosis, Dr. Ponce noted 
on December 5, 2009, that being verbally informed of her 
termination was "a 'blow' to [Cui] and has heightened her 
anxiety/depression." Dr. Ponce assessed Cui with "[s]piraling 
depression/anxiety ostensibly because supervisor 'verbally' 
14           
          
               
           
           
           
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
informed her her position will be terminated." On February 22, 
2010, Dr. Ponce noted during an urgent session with Cui that 
"[t]he reality of losing her job is beginning to sink in. 
Exacerbation of symptoms." In his June 1, 2010 treatment plan, 
Dr. Ponce then diagnosed Cui with "Major Depressive Disorder, 
single episode, mod. severe w/out psychotic features, mood 
congruent (296.23); occupational problem (V62.2)." Dr. Ponce 
also stated that Cui's prognosis was "Fair. Is exhibiting 
symptoms of Major Depression decompensating from initial Adj. 
Disorder w/ Mixed Anxiety & Depressed Mood fr. termination from 
job." 
Despite Dr. Ponce testifying that he never informed Cui 
that he changed her diagnosis from Adjustment Disorder with Mixed 
Anxiety and Depressed Mood to Major Depressive Disorder, the 
June 1, 2010 treatment plan, as well as Dr. Ponce's notes 
documenting Cui's psychiatric progress, indicate that those 
documents showing a deterioration in her condition and the change 
in diagnosis were sent to Cui's legal counsel, Lowell Chun-Hoon, 
Esq.,6 and one of Cui's treating physicians, Nicole Littenberg, 
M.D., as well as Employer-Adjuster. 
Based on the foregoing, the LIRAB's findings in FOFs 
79-83 that Cui, as a reasonable person, should have recognized the probable compensable character of her Major Depressive 
Disorder on June 1, 2010, or shortly thereafter, is not clearly 
erroneous as it is supported by reliable, probative, and 
substantial evidence on the whole record. See Hayashi, 93 
Hawai# i at 12, 994 P.2d at 1058; Igawa, 97 Hawai# i at 405–06, 38 
P.3d at 573–74. 
6 Mr. Chun-Hoon had an ethical obligation, pursuant to Hawaii Rules of
Professional Conduct (HRPC) Rule 1.4(a)(4) to keep his client reasonably informed
about the status of the matter. The commentary to the rule states that a lawyermay be justified in withholding information in some circumstances, such as "[a]lawyer might withhold a psychiatric diagnosis of a client when the examiningpsychiatrist indicates that disclosure would harm the client." HRPC Rule 1.4, cmt 7. 
15           
            
      NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Although Cui points to evidence in the record that 
could plausibly establish a later date of manifestation, since 
the LIRAB's findings are not clearly erroneous, this court 
"decline[s] to consider the weight of the evidence to ascertain 
whether it weighs in favor of the administrative findings, or to 
review the agency's findings of fact by passing upon the 
credibility of witnesses or conflicts in testimony, especially 
the findings of an expert agency dealing with a specialized 
field." Igawa, 97 Hawai# i at 409–10, 38 P.3d at 577–78 (quoting 
In re Application of Hawaiian Elec. Co., Inc., 81 Hawai# i at 465, 
918 P.2d at 567). 
Accordingly, the LIRAB did not err in 
concluding in COL 1 that WC Claim 2 was time-barred by the two-year statue of limitations under HRS § 386-82(1) because the 
effects of Cui's Major Depressive Disorder manifested on or 
around June 1, 2010, and thereby declining to address the merits 
of Cui's WC Claim 2 in COL 2. 
C. The doctrine of quasi-estoppel is not applicable. 
Cui next argues that Employer-Adjuster should be barred 
under the doctrine of quasi-estoppel from arguing that her WC 
Claim 2 was time-barred because Employer-Adjuster voluntarily 
made temporary total disability payments to Cui under WC Claim 1 
until March 7, 2011.
7 Cui asserts that those payments led her to 
believe that WC Claim 1 was the proper industrial accident to receive compensation for Cui's subsequent Major Depressive 
Disorder. 
"The doctrine of quasi-estoppel provides 'that one 
should not be permitted to take a position inconsistent with a 
previous position if the result is to harm another.'" In re 
Hawaii Org. of Police Officers, 134 Hawai# i 155, 160, 338 P.3d 
1170, 1175 (App. 2014) (quoting Univ. of Hawaii Prof'l Assembly on Behalf of Daeufer v. Univ. of Hawaii, 66 Haw. 214, 221, 659 
7 March 7, 2011, was the date of Employer-Adjuster providing Cui with
its Notice of Intent to Terminate Benefits. Pursuant to the notice, benefits 
were not terminated until March 21, 2011. 
16           
            
             
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
P.2d 720, 726 (1983)), aff'd on other grounds sub nom. In re 
Grievance Arbitration Between State Org. of Police Officers, 135 
Hawai# i 456, 353 P.3d 998 (2015). 
In this case, the record indicates that Employer-
Adjuster had only voluntarily accepted liability as to Cui's WC 
Claim 1 work injury, "specifically adjustment disorder with mixed 
anxiety and depressed mood[,]" and was required to make temporary 
total disability and temporary partial disability payments in the 
manner specified in the Director's April 22, 2010 decision for 
that injury. The record is devoid of any evidence that Employer-
Adjuster held the position that Cui's Major Depressive Disorder 
was compensable under her WC Claim 1 or that Employer-Adjuster 
made voluntary payments8 for Cui's Major Depressive Disorder. As 
a result, the doctrine of quasi-estoppel is not applicable here. 
D. The LIRAB did not err by failing to address issues that had
been deferred by the Director. 
Cui also challenges FOFs 84-88, 91, and 92 and COLs 1 
and 3 to the extent that the LIRAB declined to address the issue 
of whether Cui's Major Depressive Disorder was related to her 
August 3, 2009 injury in WC Claim 1. Cui argues that this entire 
matter, and her multiple claims, arose from the August 3, 2009 
injury and should thus be treated as a single injury. 
FOFs 84-88, 91, and 92 state: 
84. However, the Board makes no determination whether
Claimant's Major Depressive Disorder is related to her
August 3, 2009 work injury, because such issue was reservedby the Director. 
85. A determination on Claimant's entitlement to 
temporary total disability benefits after March 21, 2011 isdependent on the Director's determination of Employer'sliability for Claimant's claim for a Major DepressiveDisorder as it may relate to her August 3, 2009 work injury.
86. Therefore, it is premature for the Board to
determine whether Claimant is entitled to, and Employer 
8 HRS § 386-83(a) (2015) states in relevant part that "[i]f payments
of income and indemnity benefits have been made voluntarily by the employer, the
making of a claim within the time prescribed in section 386-82 shall not berequired." 
17 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
liable for, such temporary total disability benefits before
the Director makes her determination on the issue of compensability of Claimant's Major Depressive Disorder as itmay be related to Claimant's August 3, 2009 work injury. 
87. A determination on Claimant's entitlement to 
temporary partial disability benefits after March 25, 2010is dependent on the Director's determination of Employer'sliability for Claimant's claim for a Major DepressiveDisorder as it may relate to her August 3, 2009 work injury.
88. Therefore, it is premature for the Board to
determine whether Claimant is entitled to, and Employerliable for, such temporary partial benefits before theDirector's [sic] makes her determination on the issue ofcompensability of Claimant's Major Depressive Disorder as itmay be related to her August 3, 2009 work injury.
. . . . 
91. A determination on Claimant's entitlement to 
permanent partial disability benefits for more than thepreviously awarded 8% of the whole person is dependent onthe Director's determination of Employer's liability forClaimant's claim for a Major Depressive Disorder as it mayrelate to her August 3, 2009 work injury.
92. Therefore, it is premature for the Board to
determine whether Claimant is entitled to, and Employerliable for, additional permanent partial disability benefitsbefore the Director's [sic] makes her determination on theissue of compensability of Claimant's Major DepressiveDisorder as it may be related to her August 3, 2009 workinjury. 
A trial court's label of a finding of fact or conclusion of law 
is not determinative of the standard of review. Crosby v. State 
Dep't of Budget & Fin., 76 Hawai# i 332, 340, 876 P.2d 1300, 1308 
(1994). FOFs 84-88, 91 and 92 are actually COLs and we review them as such. 
COLs 1 and 3 state, in relevant part: 
1. . . . [t]he Board makes no determination whether
Claimant's Major Depressive Disorder is related to her
August 3, 2009 work injury, because such issue was reservedby the Director.
. . . . 
3. Since the Director deferred determination on 
Employer's liability for Claimant's Major DepressiveDisorder as it may relate to her August 3, 2009 work injury,the Board further concludes that it is premature todetermine (a) whether Claimant is entitled to temporarytotal disability benefits after March 21, 2011; (b) whetherClaimant is entitled to temporary partial disabilitybenefits after March 25, 2010; and (c) what is the extent ofpermanent partial disability, over 8% of the whole person,resulting from Claimant's August 3, 2009 work injury. 
Hawai# i Administrative Rules (HAR) § 12-47-20 states 
18 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that "[t]he board may decline to hear and determine any issue 
which the director in the decision on appeal did not decide or 
left for future determination." 
On August 16, 2012, the LIRAB remanded the appeal of 
the Director's July 1, 2011 decision back to the Director for the 
purpose of "address[ing] compensability of a claim to be filed by 
Claimant for Major Depressive Disorder and for determination of 
any other issue the Director deems appropriate." (Emphasis 
added.) The issue on remand was heard at a May 2, 2013 hearing. 
However, as stated previously, Cui does not appear to have filed 
the Amended WC Claim 1 until May 3, 2013. Therefore, the 
Director held in her June 6, 2013 decision on WC Claim 1, that 
"the Director is unable to make a determination on the 
compensability of claimant's Major Depressive Disorder" as 
related to Cui's August 3, 2009 injury because "the record is 
absent of a written claim from claimant for a Major Depressive 
Disorder." The Director then deferred the determination of 
compensability of Cui's Major Depressive Disorder for lack of a 
written claim for Major Depressive Disorder in WC Claim 1. 
It was within the LIRAB's discretion, pursuant to HAR 
§ 12-47-20, to decline to determine whether Cui's Major 
Depressive Disorder is related to her WC Claim 1 work injury 
without the Director first determining the issue based on a claim 
to be filed by Cui for Major Depressive Disorder in WC Claim 1. 
Based on the foregoing, the LIRAB's FOFs 84-88, 91, and 92, which 
we determine to be COLs, and the portions of COLs 1 and 3 recited 
above, were not a violation of constitutional or statutory 
provisions, were not made upon unlawful procedure, and were not 
arbitrary, capricious, or characterized by abuse of discretion or 
clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion. See HRS § 91-
14(g)(1), (3), (6); HAR § 12-47-20 (stating that "[t]he board may decline to hear and determine any issue which the director in the 
decision on appeal did not decide or left for future 
19 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
determination."). 
Neither the Director nor the LIRAB has decided the 
issue of whether, based on a claim to be filed by Cui in WC Claim 
1 for Major Depressive Disorder, Cui's current diagnosis of Major 
Depressive Disorder is related to her WC Claim 1 work injury. 
Therefore, this court determines that there is no decision upon 
which to review Cui's contention that this entire matter arose 
from the August 3, 2009 injury and should be treated as a single 
injury.
