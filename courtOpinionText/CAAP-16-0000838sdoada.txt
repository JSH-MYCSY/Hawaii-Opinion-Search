On appeal, DRP contends that the Circuit Court erred in 
granting Appellee-Appellee A&B Properties, Inc.'s (A&B) Motion 
1 The Honorable Rhonda I.L. Loo presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
for Summary Judgment and Appellee-Appellee Maui Planning 
Commission's (Planning Commission) Joinder. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we 
dismiss this appeal for mootness. 
This is the second appeal from the underlying case, for 
which the pertinent background is as follows. A&B applied for a 
Special Management Area Permit (Permit) with the County of Maui 
Planning Department to construct a project (Project) on land along Haleakalâ  Highway in Kahului, Hawai# i (Subject Property). 
The Planning Commission scheduled a public hearing on the Permit 
application to be held on April 26, 2011. A Notice of Hearing 
(Notice
) was published and sent via certified mail pursuant to 
the Planning Commission rules to all owners and certain lessees 
within 500 feet of the Subject Property. 
On April 25, 2011, DRP, a lessee, filed a Petition to 
Intervene (Petition), asserting that the anticipated traffic from 
the Project would affect DRP's gas station business (
Dairy Road 
Property). 
At the April 26, 2011 hearing, the Planning Commission 
voted to deny the Petition and to approve the Permit; and 
subsequently entered its July 12, 2011 Findings of Fact, 
Conclusions of Law, Decision, and Order Denying Dairy Road 
Partners' Petition to Intervene Filed on April 25, 2011 (2011 
Planning Commission FOF-COL-Order). 
2011 Appeal to Circuit Court 
On July 21, 2011, DRP appealed the 2011 Planning 
Commission FOF-COL-Order to the Circuit Court. 
On September 7, 2011, A&B filed a Motion to Dismiss 
Appeal Filed on July 21, 2011, or In the Alternative, For Summary 
Judgment, arguing that DRP failed to meet its burden in 
establishing that it was a "person aggrieved" with an actual or 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
threatened injury, or that such injury was traceable to the 
Planning Commission's conduct, which the Circuit Court granted. 
On September 29, 2011, the Circuit Court entered its Order 
Granting Appellee A&B Properties, Inc.'s Motion to Dismiss Appeal 
Filed on July 21, 2011, or, In the Alternative, For Summary 
Judgment (Order Granting A&B's Motion to Dismiss), Filed on 
September 7, 2011. 
2011 Appeal to Intermediate Court of Appeals On October 31, 2011, DRP appealed the Circuit Court's 
Order Granting A&B's Motion to Dismiss. We concluded that DRP 
had sufficiently established standing based on a declaration by 
its general partner Glenn Nakamura (Nakamura), stating that DRP 
was likely to suffer declining gasoline sales due to 
traffic-related issues related to the A&B development project, 
and thus, was a person aggrieved under Hawai# i Revised Statutes 
(HRS) § 91-14. Dairy Rd. Partners v. Maui Planning Comm'n 
, No. 
CAAP-11-0000789, 2015 WL 302643, at *4-6 (App. Jan. 23, 2015) (mem.). We explained that: 
[t]here is nothing in the record to suggest why Dairy Road
Partners, if it was allowed to intervene, would not or couldnot find relief for the injury it alleges. Indeed,intervention itself would at least "likely provide relief"by necessarily focusing the agency's attention further on
the intervenor's concerns. 
 
Dairy Rd. Partners, 2015 WL 302643, at *6. We vacated and 
remanded the matter back to Circuit Court. 
2016 Circuit Court Proceedings on Remand 
Upon remand, A&B filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on 
August 2, 2016, joined by the Planning Commission. A&B 
challenged DRP's standing, arguing that DRP lost its leasehold 
interest in the Dairy Road Property through a separate judicial 
foreclosure proceeding of the lease (Foreclosure Case)
,2 and 
thus, DRP had no interest remaining in the case. A&B submitted 
2 The foreclosure proceedings were docketed as American Savings
Bank, F.S.B. v. Dairy Rd. Partners under Civil No. 2CC131000283.

as an exhibit, an Order Granting Plaintiff Maui Gas Ventures 
LLC's Motion for Confirmation of Sale, For Distribution of 
Proceeds, For Issuance of Writ of Ejectment/Posession and For 
Deficiency Judgment as to Defendant Dairy Road Partners Filed 
March 29, 2016, filed June 21, 2016 (Foreclosure Order). 
In its Opposition, DRP argued that summary judgment was 
"procedurally improper" in an administrative appeal to the 
Circuit Court and that it was improper for the Circuit Court to 
consider the Foreclosure Order. DRP did not address the 
Foreclosure Case or the Foreclosure Order in its Opposition. 
The Circuit Court held a hearing on the Motion for 
Summary Judgment on September 15, 2016. At the close of the 
hearing, the Circuit Court ruled that, 
Diary [sic] Road Partners standing, as an agreed [sic]
party due to traffic concerns, arose from its leasehold
interest. That interest no longer exists. Diary [sic] RoadPartners does not dispute that it lot -- lost itsleasehold interest in the subject property. 
Therefore, while standing may have existed
previously, the Court is finding that Diary [sic] RoadPartners no longer has standing to challenge SMA permit. 
On October 10, 2016, the Circuit Court entered its Order Granting 
Summary Judgment and Joinder. On October 27, 2016, the Circuit 
Court entered its Final Judgment. 
This timely appeal followed. 
Concurrent Foreclosure Case (2CC131000283) 
As mentioned supra, starting in 2013, the Subject 
Property was involved in foreclosure proceedings in a separate 
case, American Savings Bank, F.S.B. v. Dairy Rd. Partners, Civil 
No. 2CC131000283.3 The parties in the Foreclosure Case were 
plaintiff American Savings Bank, F.S.B. (American Savings) and 
defendants DRP and general partner Nakamura. On January 12, 
2015, Maui Gas Ventures LLC (Maui Gas Ventures) filed a Notice 
and Substitution of [Maui Gas Ventures] as Real Party in

Interest for [American Savings], to substitute Maui Gas Ventures 
for American Savings as the real party in interest. Maui Gas 
Ventures LLC v. Dairy Rd. Partners, No. CAAP-16-0000136, 2018 WL 2316509, at *1 (App. May 22, 2018) (mem.).
4 Throughout the 
Foreclosure Case, judgments were entered in favor of Maui Gas Ventures and against DRP. At the conclusion of the Foreclosure 
Case, Maui Gas Ventures purchased the Subject Property. DRP 
appealed these judgments in a consolidated appeal that included, 
inter alia, a series of orders granting summary judgment, sale of 
the property, confirmation of sale, distribution of proceeds, 
writ of ejectment/possession, and a deficiency judgment. 
On May 22, 2018, this court issued its Memorandum 
Opinion affirming the judgments entered by the Circuit Court in 
the Foreclosure Case. Maui Gas Ventures LLC, 2018 WL 2316509, at 
*4. 
Current Appellate Proceedings 
In its Opening Brief, DRP contends, inter alia,
5 that 
the Circuit Court erred in deciding a motion for summary judgment 
in an administrative appeal, and erred in holding that it did not 
have subject matter jurisdiction because, at the time of filing 
its Opening Brief, DRP had supplied a declaration that it had 
been at the Subject Property since 1985. DRP argues that while 
4 We have discretion to take judicial notice "where the equity of
the situation dictates" and may take judicial notice of court records which
are not part of the record on appeal. State v. Kwong, 149 Hawai #i 106, 117,
482 P.3d 1067, 1078 (2021) (quoting Eli v. State, 63 Haw. 474, 478, 630 P.2d113, 116 (1981)). 
5 Specifically, DRP contends that: (1) the Circuit Court erred in
deciding a motion for summary judgment in an administrative appeal to theCircuit Court, where HRS § 94-14(b) states in pertinent part that an appeal tothe [C]ircuit [C]ourt "shall be treated in the same manner as an appeal fromthe Circuit Court to the intermediate appellate court;" (2) the Circuit Courterred in holding on a motion for summary judgment that the Circuit Court hadno subject-matter jurisdiction; (3) the Circuit Court erred in holding on amotion for summary judgment that the Planning Commission correctly deniedDRP's Petition by finding there was no good cause to excuse DRP's untimelyfiling where the notice of hearing was mailed in accordance with PlanningCommission Rule; and (4) the Circuit Court erred in holding on a motion forsummary judgment that the Commission correctly denied DRP's Petition byfinding that DRP was not entitled to be mailed a notice of hearing where theDairy Road Property was located more than 500 feet from the Subject Property. 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 the Foreclosure Order states, "[U]pon closing of escrow . . . the 
Purchaser or his written nominee shall be entitled to immediate 
and exclusive possession of the Mortgaged Property," there is 
nothing in the record to indicate that the purchaser of the Lease 
has immediate and exclusive possession of the Subject Property. 
DRP argues that, at the time of filing its OB, as the Foreclosure 
Order was under appeal, the "record on appeal therefore continues 
to support DRP's standing" as an "aggrieved person" pursuant to 
our Memorandum Opinion in 
Dairy Rd. Partners, 2015 WL 302643, at 
*6. 
A&B argues that DRP lacks standing to appeal as a 
"person aggrieved" based on DRP's leasehold interest in the Dairy Road Property and the "allegedly adverse effect that the Project 
would have on traffic." A&B requests that this court take 
judicial notice of the Foreclosure Case and its then-pending 
appeal. A&B asserts that DRP lost its leasehold interest through 
the Foreclosure Case, a fact that is undisputed by DRP. A&B 
states, "The leasehold interest was sold, the purchaser was 
granted 'immediate and exclusive possession' of the Dairy Road 
Property and DRP's interest in the Property was 'forever barred 
and foreclosed.'" A&B argues that even if the Foreclosure Case 
has been appealed, the appeal makes no difference because DRP did 
not obtain a stay of enforcement of the Foreclosure Order and 
Judgment pending appeal in this case. 
In light of the reference to the Foreclosure Order and 
Foreclosure Case in both parties' briefs, on September 7, 2021, 
we issued an Order to Show Cause (OSC) to provide the parties an 
opportunity to explain why, given DRP losing its leasehold 
interest in the Subject Property, this appeal should not be 
dismissed for mootness and lack of subject matter jurisdiction. 
Mootness 
"It is axiomatic that mootness is an issue of subject 
matter jurisdiction. Whether a court possesses subject matter 
jurisdiction is a question of law reviewable de novo." Kaleikini

193 P.3d 839, 842-43 (2008)). "[I]f the parties do not raise the 
issue of a lack of subject matter jurisdiction," this court will 
raise it sua sponte. Kapuwai v. City & Cty. of Honolulu Dep't of 
Parks & Recreation

(quoting Tamashiro v. Dep't of Human Servs., State of Hawai# i, 
112 Hawai# i 388, 389, 146 P.3d 103, 113 (2006)); see also Sierra 
Club v. Castle & Cooke Homes Hawaii, Inc., 132 Hawai# i 184, 190 
n.13, 320 P.3d 849, 855 n.13 (2013) (citing Chun v. Employees' Ret. Sys. of the State of Hawaii, 73 Haw. 9, 13, 828 P.2d 260, 
263 (1992)). 
The parties filed timely responses to the OSC. 
In its 
Response to our OSC, DRP contends that this appeal should not be 
dismissed for mootness for several reasons. First, DRP argues 
that it has standing and is still considered an "aggrieved 
person" pursuant to HRS § 91-14 and as recognized by this court 
in Dairy Rd. Partners, 2015 WL 302643, at *4-6. Second, DRP 
argues that there is no authority holding that once an aggrieved 
person has become entitled to judicial review under HRS § 91-14, 
that subsequent events, such as the Foreclosure Case, can render 
an appeal moot. Third, DRP argues that if a foreclosure of its 
leasehold interest caused DRP to lose its standing as an 
"aggrieved person" to appeal under HRS § 91-14(a), it "would be 
improper, particularly since DRP's appeal to the circuit court is 
from a denial of a petition to intervene rather than from the 
dismissal of a lawsuit." DRP does not provide authority to 
support its third argument. DRP also did not address the 
mootness doctrine, nor any of the exceptions to the mootness 
doctrine. We may disregard a "particular contention if the 
appellant makes no discernible argument in support of that 
position." Hawaii Ventures, LLC v. Otaka, Inc., 114 Hawai# i 438, 
478-79, 164 P.3d 696, 736-37 (2007) (citation omitted). 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
A&B argues that mootness applies to contested case 
appeals under HRS § 91-14 and that the appeal is moot because 
DRP's leasehold interest is foreclosed. Planning Commission 
argues that dismissal for lack of appellate jurisdiction is 
appropriate under the authorities cited by this court. 
DRP's appeal is moot because relief is no longer
available to DRP. 
DRP argues that there is no authority holding that 
subsequent events can make relief no longer available to an 
aggrieved person entitled to judicial review of the Planning 
Commission's decision pursuant to HRS § 91-14. DRP claims that: 
[T]he actualization of the very harm DRP's general partner
predicted would result from [A&B]'s development project andthat served as the basis for the ICA finding injury-in-fact- a further reduction in gasoline sales because regularcustomers are avoiding traffic on the road fronting DRP'sstation (which in turn has resulted in DRP defaulting on itsmortgage and being foreclosed upon) – is now a new basis toargue that DRP no longer has standing to appeal theCommission's decision denying DRP’s Petition . . . . 
DRP's argument, however, does not address how this 
court is able to grant effective relief if DRP does not have an 
interest in the Subject Property that was the subject of its 
Petition to the Planning Commission. See Bank of New York Mellon 
v. R. Onaga, Inc., 140 Hawai# i 358, 366, 400 P.3d 559, 567 (2017) 
(quoting Kaho# ohanohano v. State, 114 Hawai# i 302, 332, 162 P.3d 
696, 726 (2007)) ("A case is moot if the reviewing court can no longer grant effective relief.")(brackets omitted). 
[A] case is moot where the question to be determined is
abstract and does not rest on existing facts or rights.Thus, the mootness doctrine is properly invoked where eventshave so affected the relations between the parties that thetwo conditions of justiciability relevant on appeal—adverseinterest and effective remedy—have been compromised. 
R. Onaga, Inc., 140 Hawai# i at 365, 400 P.3d at 566 (brackets in 
original) (quoting Okada Trucking Co., Ltd. v. Bd. of Water 
Supply, 99 Hawai# i 191, 195-96, 53 P.3d 799, 803-04 (2002)). 
Thus, if an event occurs that renders it impossible for an appellate court to grant an appellant "any effectual relief 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
whatever, the court will not proceed to a formal judgment, but 
will dismiss the appeal." City Bank v. Saje Ventures II, 7 Haw. 
App. 130, 134, 748 P.2d 812, 815 (1988) (quoting Mills v. Green, 159 U.S. 651, 653 (1895)). 
Our courts have recognized that the sale of a subject 
property during the pendency of an appeal renders an appeal moot, 
as no effective relief may be granted by the court. Lathrop v. 
Sakatani, 111 Hawai# i 307, 313, 141 P.3d 480, 486 (2006). 
Further, it is the "appellant's burden to seek a stay if post-
appeal transactions could render the appeal moot." Id. (quoting 
In re Gotcha Int'l L.P., 311 B.R. 250, 255 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. 2004)). 
Here, it is apparent from the record that we do not 
have the ability to grant DRP effective relief if this case is 
vacated and remanded to the Circuit Court for judicial review 
pursuant to HRS § 91-14. It is undisputed by DRP that its 
leasehold interest in the Subject Property was sold in the 
Foreclosure Case. Instead, DRP bases its argument on the fact 
that it was still in possession of the property as of the filing 
of its Opening Brief in 2017. However, the confirmation of sale 
and its accompanying judgments in the Foreclosure Case, including 
a writ of ejectment/posession, were affirmed on appeal by this 
court in 2018. As the judgment was affirmed, possession was 
granted to Maui Gas Ventures, the purchaser of the Lease, and DRP 
is without possession of the property. As DRP did not attempt to 
obtain a stay of proceedings to enforce the judgment pending 
appeal, it lost possession upon entry of the 2016 Final Judgment. 
See R. Onaga, Inc., 140 Hawai# i at 367, 400 P.3d at 568; Lathrop, 
111 Hawai# i at 313, 141 P.3d at 486. 
Even if this court found that DRP had standing in the 
2011 Appeal, because the Foreclosure Case and its subsequent appeal were affirmed and have since concluded, and DRP has since 
lost the Lease and possession of the property, there is no 
effective remedy that can be granted to DRP in this case. See 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Lathrop, 111 Hawai# i at 313, 141 P.3d at 486. If this court 
vacates and remands the instant case for judicial review by the 
Circuit Court, the Circuit Court will be left to decide whether 
the Planning Commission should have granted DRP's Petition under 
circumstances where DRP no longer possesses the Subject Property. 
See R. Onaga, Inc., 140 Hawai# i at 366, 400 P.3d at 567.  As the 
conditions of justiciability relevant on appeal of "adverse interest and effective remedy" are no longer present, we conclude 
that this case must be dismissed as moot.
