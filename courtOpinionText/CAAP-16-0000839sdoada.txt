STATE OF HAWAII, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
MARK TATSUO YAMAGUCHI, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
PUNA DIVISION
(CASE NO. 3DCW-16-0000490)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Mark Yamaguchi ( Yamaguchi ) appeals
from a Judgment and Notice of Entry of Judgment, entered on
September 20, 2016, by the District Court of the Third Circuit
(district court ).1  The district court convicted Yamaguchi of one
count of Terroristic Threatening in the Second Degree ( TT2), in
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS ) § 707-717(1) (2014)2 
1  The Honorable Harry P. Freitas presided.
2  HRS § 707-717(1) provides: 
[§707-717] Terroristic threatening in the second degree .  (1) A
person commits the offense of terroristic threatening in the second
degree if the person commits terroristic threatening other than as
provided in section 707-716.
"Terroristic threatening" is defined in HRS § 707-715 (2014) as follows:

and one count of Harassment, in violation of HRS § 711-1106(1)
(2014).  On appeal, Yamaguchi argues that the district court
wrongly convicted him of TT2 because Plaintiff-Appellee State of
Hawai#i (State) failed to negate his claim of self-defense under
HRS § 703-304(1) (2014).3  Yamaguchi does not challenge his
conviction for Harassment.  
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve Yamaguchi's point of error as follows and affirm.
Viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution,
especially given that credibility determinations are the trial
court's province, there is substantial evidence negating
Yamaguchi's self-defense claim.  See State v. Lubong, 77 Hawai# i
429, 432, 886 P.2d 766, 769 (App. 1994).
There is substantial evidence in this case that
Yamaguchi did not subjectively believe he was in danger of being
harmed when he picked up the four-to-five pound volcanic rock
that Sybastian Keltner ( Sy) and Tory Keltner (collectively, the
Keltners ) feared would be thrown at Sy.  Yamaguchi testified that
Sy yelled at him from far away and that "[Sy] was scared of me,
yeah.  That's why he can talk; he can talk big from far."  The
2(...continued)
§707-715 Terroristic threatening, defined .  A person commits the
offense of terroristic threatening if the person threatens, by word or
conduct, to cause bodily injury to another person or serious damage or
harm to property, including the pets or livestock, of another or to
commit a felony:
(1) With the intent to terrorize, or in reckless disregard of
the risk of terrorizing, another person; or
(2) With intent to cause, or in reckless disregard of the risk
of causing evacuation of a building, place of assembly, or
facility of public transportation.
3  HRS § 703-304(1) provides:
§703-304 Use of force in self-protection . (1) Subject to the
provisions of this section and of section 703-308, the use of force upon
or toward another person is justifiable when the actor believes that
such force is immediately necessary for the purpose of protecting
himself against the use of unlawful force by the other person on the
present occasion.

district court reasonably inferred from this that Yamaguchi did
not feel threatened.  Lubong, 77 Hawai# i at 433, 886 P.2d at 770. 
Further, the district court found the Keltners' testimony
credible and they testified that after Yamaguchi picked up the
rock and it appeared he was going to throw it at Sy, at that
point Yamaguchi turned around, went toward his property, but then
returned and threw eggs at the Keltners.  This provides further
evidence from which the district court could have reasonably
inferred that Yamaguchi was not fearful or intimidated by the
Keltners and did not subjectively believe that force was
necessary to protect himself.
Even if Yamaguchi actually did feel threatened, there
is substantial evidence that a reasonable person in Yamaguchi's
position would not have found it necessary to use force for the
purpose of self–protection.  HRS § 703-304(1); Lubong, 77 Hawai'i
at 433, 886 P.2d at 770.  The Keltners testified that Yamaguchi
hoisted the large rock (which Sy testified was the size of a
"good sized grapefruit"), cocked back his arm, and stepped toward
Sy, as if preparing to pitch the rock at him.  The Keltners
testified that Yamaguchi instigated the confrontation by yelling
and screaming accusations and profanities at them while he was on
their property.  See State v. Mailo , No. 28512, 2008 WL 5053563,
at *1, (Haw. App. Dec. 1, 2008) (SDO).  Further, the Keltners
testified that they were never closer than five feet away from
Yamaguchi, there is evidence that the Keltners did not threaten
Yamaguchi, and Yamaguchi testified that Sy did not do anything
physical to him.
Given the above, there is substantial evidence in the
record supporting the district court's ruling that the
prosecution proved beyond a reasonable doubt facts negativing
Yamaguchi's claim of self-defense.
