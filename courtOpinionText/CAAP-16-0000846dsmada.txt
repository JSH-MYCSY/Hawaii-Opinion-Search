IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
DAVID RUDACILLE AND CAROL ZIMMERMAN, Plaintiffs-Appellees,
v.
 
SHARMAN O'SHEA, Defendant-Appellee,
and
 
WILLIAM GILROY, for Hawaii Food Forest Project,
Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 3RC-16-1-473K)

 
ORDER DENYING THE FEBRUARY 13, 2017 MOTION
AND

 
ORDER DISMISSING THE APPEAL
 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the Affidavit in Support of
 
Motion for Leave to Proceed on Appeal In Forma Pauperis, filed
 
February 13, 2017, by Defendant-Appellee Sharman G. O’Shea
 (O’Shea), pro se, the papers in support, and the record, it
 appears that:
 
(1) On December 2, 2016, Defendant-Appellant William
 
Gilroy (Gilroy), pro se, filed a notice of appeal. The notice of
 appeal identifies Gilroy as the appellant, and Gilroy apparently
 signed the document. Although O’Shea was a defendant in the
 underlying case, 3RC16-1-473K, O’Shea did not sign the notice of
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appeal, and the document does not identify O’Shea as an 
appellant; 
(2) On December 2, 2016, the district court in the
 
underlying case denied Gilroy’s request for a fee waiver, which
 the court construes as a denial of a motion for leave to proceed
 on appeal in forma pauperis;
 
(3) Thereafter, Gilroy did not ask this court for leave 
to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis. See Hawai
'i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 24(a); 
(4) On February 1, 2017, the appellate clerk notified
 
Gilroy that the time to docket the record on appeal expired on
 January 31, 2017, the filing and docketing fees had not been
 paid, the record on appeal cannot be prepared without payment of
 the fees or an order authorizing Gilroy to proceed on appeal in
 forma pauperis, the matter would be called to the court's
 attention on February 11, 2017, for action that may include
 dismissal, and Gilroy may file a motion requesting relief from
 default;
 
(5) Gilroy did not pay the filing fees or take any
 
further action in this appeal;
 
(6) An appeal may be dismissed where the record on
 
appeal has not been prepared because the appellant failed to pay 
the required fees or obtain an order allowing the appellant to
 proceed in forma pauperis. HRAP Rule 11(b)(2) & (c)(2); and
 
(7) O’Shea seeks leave to proceed on appeal in forma
 
pauperis, but he is not the appellant in this appeal, which is
 subject to dismissal as discussed above. Thus, the court will
 deny his request for relief.
