APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 15-1-0650(1))

 
AMENDED

 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION

 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of Defendants/Counterclaim-Plaintiffs/
 
Cross-Claim Defendants/Appellants Richard Allen Castro, Liann
 
Castro and Chrissie H. Castro's (the Castro Appellants) appeal
 from the Honorable Rhonda I.L. Loo's November 14, 2016 judgment,
 it appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction because the
 circuit court's November 14, 2016 judgment does not comply with
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the requirements for an appealable final judgment under Hawaii 
Revised Statutes (HRS) 641-1(a) (2016), Rule 58 of the Hawai 'i 
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP), and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 
1334, 1338 (1994). 
HRS 641-1(a) authorizes appeals to the Hawai 'i 
Intermediate Court of Appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS ยง 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS ยง 641-1(c). HRCP Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." Based on HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i requires that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after 
the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 119, 869 
P.2d at 1338. "Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai
'i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 
1186 (2008); Bailey v. DuVauchelle, 135 Hawai 'i 482, 489, 353 
P.3d 1024, 1031 (2015). Furthermore, 
if a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a case
involving multiple claims or multiple parties, the judgment
(a) must specifically identify the party or parties for and
against whom the judgment is entered, and (b) must (i)
identify the claims for which it is entered, and
(ii) dismiss any claims not specifically identified[.]
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (emphases added). 
For example: "Pursuant to the jury verdict entered on
(date), judgment in the amount of $___ is hereby entered in
favor of Plaintiff X and against Defendant Y upon counts I
through IV of the complaint." . . . . If the circuit court
 intends that claims other than those listed in the judgment
language should be dismissed, it must say so: for example,
"Defendant Y's counterclaim is dismissed," or "Judgment upon
Defendant Y's counterclaim is entered in favor of
 Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all other claims,
counterclaims, and cross-claims are dismissed."

Id. at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4 (emphasis added). 
When interpreting the requirements for an appealable final judgment under HRS ยง 641-1(a) and HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has explained that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality, . . . and we should not make such searches
necessary by allowing the parties the option of waiving the
requirements of HRCP [Rule] 58. 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (citation omitted; 
original emphasis). 
Although the instant case involves multiple claims as a
 
result of Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellee County of
 
Maui's complaint, the Castro Appellants' counterclaim, and
 Defendant/Cross-Claim Plaintiff/Appellee Association of Apartment
 Owners of Kihei Villages' (Appellee AOAO Kihei Villages) multiple
 cross-claims, the November 14, 2016 judgment does not identify
 the claim or claims on which the circuit court intends to enter
 judgment when it enters judgment in favor of Appellee AOAO Kihei
 Villages and against the Castro Appellants and Defendants/Cross-
Claim Defendants/Appellees Argent Mortgage Company, LLC,
 Princeton Reconveyance Service, and Beneficial Hawaii, Inc. In
 the absence of any identification of the claim or claims on which
 the circuit court intends to enter judgment, the November 14,
 2016 judgment fails to satisfy the requirements for an appealable
 final judgment under HRS 641-1(a), HRCP Rule 58, and the holding
 in Jenkins, and thus, the November 14, 2016 judgment is not
 eligible for appellate review. Accordingly,
