SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Shane Kirby (Kirby) appeals from
 
the Second Amended Judgment of Conviction and Sentence, entered
 
on October 31, 2016 (Judgment), by the Circuit Court of the
 
Second Circuit (Circuit Court).
1 Kirby was sentenced by the
 
Circuit Court to a maximum of twenty years of imprisonment after
 
Kirby self-terminated his participation in Maui's Drug Court
 Program (Drug Court Program).

 The Honorable Joseph E. Cardoza presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Kirby raises two points on appeal, contending that: 
(1) the Circuit Court did not properly engage in an on-the-record
 
colloquy with him and, thereby, erred in failing to ensure that
 Kirby's waiver of his right to a termination hearing was
 knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made; and (2) the
 Circuit Court erred in sentencing him to serve ten years of
 imprisonment on nine counts, to run consecutively to the
 sentences for his other offenses, because the court failed to
 provide an adequate explanation for imposition of the consecutive
 terms, thereby violating Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 706­
668.5 (2014)
2 and 706-606 (2014).3
 
2 HRS § 706-668.5 provides:
 
§706-668.5 Multiple sentence of imprisonment.
(1) If multiple terms of imprisonment are imposed on a
defendant, whether at the same time or at different
times, or if a term of imprisonment is imposed on a
defendant who is already subject to an unexpired term
of imprisonment, the terms may run concurrently or
consecutively. Multiple terms of imprisonment run
concurrently unless the court orders or the statute
mandates that the terms run consecutively.
 
(2) The court, in determining whether the terms
imposed are to be ordered to run concurrently or
consecutively, shall consider the factors set forth in
section 706-606.
 
3 HRS § 706-606 provides:
 
§706-606 Factors to be considered in imposing a
sentence. The court, in determining the particular
sentence to be imposed, shall consider:
 
(1) The nature and circumstances of the offense 
and the history and characteristics of the
defendant;
 
(2) The need for the sentence imposed:
 
(a) To reflect the seriousness of the 
offense, to promote respect for law,
and to provide just punishment for the
offense;
 
(b) To afford adequate deterrence to
criminal conduct; 
 
(continued...)

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Kirby's points of error as follows:
 
(1) Kirby contends that the Circuit Court's colloquy
 
failed to sufficiently establish that his waiver was knowing,
 intelligent, and voluntary because the court did not inquire into
 whether Kirby's mind was clear and free from medication, drugs,
 alcohol, emotional or mental instability, or other undue
 influences. The State counters that based on the totality of the
 circumstances, the Circuit Court, through its colloquy, was able
 to determine whether Kirby was under the influence of drugs or
 alcohol, whether he suffered from mental illness or emotional
 disability, whether his mind was clear, and whether Kirby was
 forced to make his decision to withdraw.
 
The Hawai' i Supreme Court has explained that a valid 
waiver is the "knowing, intelligent, and voluntary relinquishment of a known right." Kong, 131 Hawai' i at 108, 315 P.3d at 734 
3(...continued)
 
(c) To protect the public from further
crimes of the defendant; and
 
(d) To provide the defendant with needed
educational or vocational training,
medical care, or other correctional
treatment in the most effective 
manner;
 
(3) The kinds of sentences available; and
 
(4) The need to avoid unwarranted sentence 
disparities among defendants with similar
records who have been found guilty of
similar conduct.

(quoting Friedman, 93 Hawai' i at 68, 996 P.2d at 273 (citation 
omitted)). 
Generally, the court will conduct a colloquy to ensure
that the defendant's waiver of his or her rights is
knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently made. State
 
v. Kaulia, 128 Hawai 'i 479, 495–96, 291 P.3d 377,
393–94 (2013). To determine whether a waiver is voluntary and intelligent, "this court will look tothe totality of facts and circumstances of eachparticular case." Friedman, 93 Hawai 'i at 68–69, 996
P.2d at 273–74. 
Id. 
In Kong, the supreme court considered the waiver of the 
right to a Drug Court Program termination hearing, specifically, 
whether the waiver was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. Id. 
Hawai'i at 108, 315 P.3d at 734. In Kong, the decision to self-
terminate from drug court was confirmed by the defendant in two separate hearings. Id. At the first hearing, Kong was advised 
of and questioned regarding his understanding of the numerous consequences of waiving his right to a termination hearing. Id. 
At the second hearing a week later, Kong again indicated that he wished to self-terminate and in a brief colloquy with the court "confirmed that his mind was clear and that he was not taking any drugs or medication. . . ." Id. The circuit court at the second 
hearing did not again advise Kong, as it had in the first hearing, regarding the numerous consequences of his waiver. Id. 
Kong argued that the colloquy prior to his self-termination at the second hearing was, therefore, insufficient to ensure a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver. Id. Looking at the 
totality of the circumstances, the supreme court found that the waiver was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary because Kong was 
4
    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
advised of his rights and had, over the course of the two
 
hearings, indicated his wish to self-terminate. Id. 
Having reviewed the transcripts from Kirby's status
 
hearing and the withdrawal hearing, it is apparent the Circuit
 Court diligently explored whether Kirby understood the rights he
 was relinquishing by waiving his right to a termination hearing
 and made a great effort to ensure that Kirby understood the
 consequences of making the waiver. However, Kirby is correct
 that the Circuit Court did not inquire at the status hearing, the
 withdrawal hearing, or at the stipulated-facts trial whether
 Kirby was of sound mind or whether he had taken any medications,
 drugs, or alcohol that might influence his judgment or ability to
 understand the proceedings or consequences arising from his
 decision to waive his right to a termination hearing. 
We do not decide, as advocated by Kirby, that every
 
colloquy in which a circuit court fails to explicitly inquire of
 the defendant whether he or she has ingested medication, alcohol,
 or has any other undue influences upon his or her waiver of
 rights is defective. Rather, given the totality of the
 circumstances in this case, there were sufficient indications
 that should have alerted the Circuit Court that explicit
 questioning regarding Kirby's mental state was vital to ensuring
 that Kirby's waiver was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. 
As noted by the Circuit Court, Kirby's history as a
 
drug user was extensive. It is a salient fact that Kirby stated
 that his failure to continue in the Drug Court Program and his
 leaving Maui was the result of the death of his mother and the
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
deep emotional turmoil resulting therefrom. In a letter
 
submitted to the Circuit Court, Kirby explained that the event of
 her death precipitated his return to drug use and caused severe
 emotional trauma that continued until shortly before he turned
 himself in to law enforcement. In his letter, Kirby's anguish
 and his inability to rationally cope with his loss is apparent. 
The letter also conveyed a strong desire to be "part of the Drug
 Court family again," which is inconsistent with his self-
termination from the program without a termination hearing. We
 agree with the State that there is no specific indication in the
 transcripts that Kirby was impaired and Kirby's counsel made no
 representation to that effect. However, there was evidence that
 (1) Kirby had a long history of abusing drugs and alcohol, and
 (2) Kirby had recently suffered extreme emotional and mental
 suffering caused by the death of his mother that reportedly
 caused him to relapse. 
We conclude that, under the totality of the
 
circumstances, further inquiry by the Circuit Court into Kirby's
 mental state and the voluntariness of his actions was necessary
 to ensure that his waiver was being made knowingly,
 intelligently, and voluntarily before accepting his self-
termination from the Drug Court Program and the waiver of his
 right to a termination hearing. 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's October 31, 2016
 
Judgment is vacated and this case is remanded for further
 proceedings consistent with this Summary Disposition Order.

Accordingly, we need not address Kirby's arguments regarding his
 
consecutive sentences.
