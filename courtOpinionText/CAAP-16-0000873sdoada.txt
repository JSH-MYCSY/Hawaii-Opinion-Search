for the person and guard against
casualty[.]
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
On appeal, Wakamoto argues that the district court (1)
 
erred by admitting into evidence, in Case No. 1DTA-15-05435,
 
Officer Manueli Kotobalavu's testimony regarding Wakamoto's
 Standardized Field Sobriety Test ("SFST") where the testimony
 appeared to be based on the officer's review of a past
 recollection recorded rather than his memory; and (2) plainly
 erred by failing to dismiss sua sponte a charge against Wakamoto,
 brought in a separate case, Case No. 1DT1-15-207284, for crossing
 a broken white line lane marker in an unsafe manner while
 operating a motor vehicle ("Unsafe Broken Line Crossing") in
 violation of HRS section 291C-38(c)(1), because it arose out of
 the OVUII charge.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Wakamoto's points of error as follows.
 
1.	 The District Court did not err by admitting Officer
Kotobalavu's testimony regarding the SFSTs. 
Wakamoto contests the District Court's admission of
 
Officer Kotobalavu's testimony regarding the SFSTs because the
 
testimony was based on the officer's review of his police report
 rather than his memory. At trial, when asked on direct
 examination where Wakamoto's vehicle was stopped, Officer
 Kotobalavu could not recall. Counsel for the State presented
 Officer Kotobalavu with a copy of his police report to refresh
 his recollection. The officer said that his recollection was
 refreshed, then testified that the stop was on Kalakaua Avenue. 
Officer Kotobalavu testified about a matter that he
 
personally experienced. There is no evidence, such as an
 admission that he relied solely on his report or a failure to
 recall other details about his arrival on the scene, to suggest
 that he based his testimony only on what he read in the report. 
See Haw. R. Evid. 602 (a witness must have personal knowledge of
 matters to which he or she testifies) and 612 (writings may be
 used to refresh a witness's memory); State v. Doo, No. CAAP-15­0000449, 2016 WL 6906706, at *4 (Haw. Ct. App. Nov. 23, 2016)
 (officer's testimony was based on memory because after viewing
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
his report, he testified that his recollection was refreshed and 
provided additional details). Cf. State v. Dibenedetto, 80 
Hawai'i 138, 144–45, 906 P.2d 624, 630–31 (App. 1995) (officer 
did not have a "present recollection" where he indicated that his testimony was based on his report, offered at trial to refresh his recollection, rather than based on his own memory as revived or rekindled by the report). 
After testifying extensively about his encounter with
 
Wakamoto and administration of the horizontal gaze nystagmus
 ("HGN") test, Officer Kotobalavu recalled that while receiving
 instructions on the Walk-and-Turn test, Wakamoto "might have"
 swayed approximately six inches to his left and right, and that
 he began the test before being told to do so. Furthermore, while
 performing both portions of the test, Wakamoto raised his arms
 approximately six inches from his body to keep his balance,
 missed heel-to-toe connections, stopped on the ninth step, and
 then took an extra step. 
Over Wakamoto's objection, the State presented Officer
 
Kotobalavu with a copy of his report to refresh his recollection
 regarding any other aspects of Wakamoto's performance on the
 Walk-and-Turn. After looking at the report, and without stating
 that his recollection had been refreshed, the officer testified
 that after completing the first part of the test, Wakamoto spun
 around on his right foot, whereas he had been instructed to turn
 on his left foot, using short, choppy steps. 
Again, Officer Kotobalavu did not state that his 
testimony was based solely on his report. See Dibenedetto, 80 
Hawai
'i at 144, 906 P.2d at 630. Further, prior to looking at 
the report, he recalled numerous details about the incident, including Wakamoto's appearance and odor, how he conducted and Wakamoto performed the HGN test, and other aspects of Wakamoto's performance on the Walk-and-Turn test. See State v. Nakamitsu, 
No. CAAP-14-0001151, 2016 WL 381475 at *12 (Haw. Ct. App. Jan. 29, 2016), aff'd, 140 Hawai
'i 157, 398 P.3d 746 (2017) 
(officer's recollection not based solely on his memory of his police report, despite repeatedly refreshing his memory with his report, where he did not state that his testimony was based 
3
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
solely on his report, report appeared to stimulate his memory of
 
numerous details, and he recalled significant details about
 incident prior to having his recollection refreshed). It is
 reasonable under the circumstances to infer that the SFST report
 merely jogged Officer Kotobalavu's memory. Wakamoto provides no
 authority for the contention that an officer is required to say
 whether his recollection was refreshed after looking at the
 report, and we find none. 
2.	 We Lack Jurisdiction to Address Wakamoto's Second Point
 
of Error.
 
Wakamoto contests the District Court's failure to 
dismiss the charge of Unsafe Broken Line Crossing, in Case No. 
1DTI-15-207284, but in the Amended Notice of Appeal, he designated only the judgment convicting him of OVUII in Case No. 1DTA-15-05435. See generally Haw. R. App. P. 3(c)(2) ("The 
notice of appeal shall designate the judgment . . . appealed from."); Chun v. Bd. of Trs. of the Emps.' Ret. Sys. of the State of Hawai
'i, 92 Hawai 'i 432, 448, 992 P.2d 127, 143 (2000) ("The 
notice of appeal shall designate the judgment . . . or part thereof appealed from." (quoting Haw. R. App. P. Rule 3(c)) (internal quotation marks omitted)). There is no evidence that the District Court consolidated the two cases, though the court heard both cases at the same time. 
The trial transcript reflects clearly that the court 
addressed the broken line crossing charge at the close of the proceeding, however, there is no evidence of any objection being made at the time. Neither the Amended Notice of Appeal nor the originally-filed Notice of Appeal designate in any way the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment filed in Case No. 1DTI-15-207284, in which the court found Wakamoto guilty of Unsafe Broken Line Crossing. Furthermore, the $50 fine imposed by the court for violation of HRS section 291C-38(c)(1) is not included in the judgment from which the appeal is taken. See 
State v. Graybeard, 93 Hawai
'i 513, 516, 6 P.3d 385, 388 (App. 
2000) ("[A] mistake in designating the judgment . . . should not result in loss of the appeal as long as the intention to appeal 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
from a specific judgment can be fairly inferred from the notice
 
and the appellee is not misled by the mistake." (citation and
 internal quotation marks omitted, emphasis added)). Thus, the
 judgment in Case No. 1DTI-15-207284 is not contained in the
 record on appeal in the instant case and no reference to Case No.
 1DTI-15-207284 appears anywhere in the Notice of Appeal or
 Amended Notice of Appeal or the exhibits attached to them. 
Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to address Wakamoto's second
 point of error.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of
 
Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, issued by the
 District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division, on
 November 17, 2016, is affirmed.
