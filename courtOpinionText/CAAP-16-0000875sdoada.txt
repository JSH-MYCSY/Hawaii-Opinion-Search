v.
JUNTA TOKUNAGA, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
#EWA DIVISION
(CASE NO. 1DTA-16-02666)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Fujise, Presiding Judge and Chan, J. with 
Nakamura, Chief Judge, concurring separately)
Defendant-Appellant Junta Tokunaga (Tokunaga) appeals
from a Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment
(Judgment), entered on November 22, 2016 by the District Court of
the First Circuit, #Ewa Division (district court).1  Tokunaga was
convicted of Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an
Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
§ 291E-61(a)(1) and (3).2
1The Honorable James C. McWhinnie presided.
2HRS § 291E-61 (Supp. 2016) provides in relevant part:
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle
under the influence of an intoxicant if the person
operates or assumes actual physical control of a
vehicle:
(1) While under the influence of alcohol in an
amount sufficient to impair the person's
normal mental faculties or ability to care
for the person and guard against casualty;NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve
Tokunaga's points of error as follows.
(1) Tokunaga argues that the district court reversibly
erred by failing to hold a hearing on his motion to suppress
evidence (Motion to Suppress).  The State concedes this point.
Notwithstanding the State's concession, "appellate courts have an
independent duty 'first to ascertain that the confession of error
is supported by the record and well-founded in law and second to
determine that such error is properly preserved and
prejudicial.'"  State v. Veikoso , 102 Hawai# i 219, 221–22, 74
P.3d 575, 577–78 (2003) (citing to State v. Hoang , 93 Hawai #i
333, 336, 3 P.3d 499, 502 (2000).  In other words, the State's
concession of error "is not binding upon an appellate court[.]"
Hoang, 93 Hawai #i at 336, 3 P.3d at 502 (quoting Territory v.
Kogami, 37 Haw. 174, 175 (Haw. Terr. 1945)) (internal quotation
marks omitted).
Rule 12(b)(3) and (e) of the Hawai #i Rules of Penal
Procedure (HRPP) provide that motions to suppress evidence must
be raised and ruled upon prior to trial.  See  HRPP Rule 12(b) and
(e).  See also State v. Thomas , 72 Haw. 48, 53-54, 805 P.2d 1212,
1214-15 (1991) (citing State v. Rodgers , 70 Haw. 156, 157, 766
P.2d 675, 675 (1988)) (trial court's failure to decide a motion
to suppress prior to trial constituted reversible error).
Because there is no evidence in the record on appeal that the
district court ever ruled on Tokunaga's Motion to Suppress, the
district court violated HRPP Rule 12(e), and Tokunaga's
conviction must be vacated.
(2) We note that Tokunaga has not presented any
argument establishing that the district court erred in admitting
his breath test result.
Tokunaga argues that there was insufficient evidence to
support his OVUII conviction.  We disagree.  Although the
. . . . 
(3) With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two

2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
district court acknowledged that Tokunaga's medical condition may
have affected his balance, speech, and performance on the field
sobriety tests, it relied on the totality of circumstances, which
included Tokunaga's speeding, stumbling and poor balance upon
exiting his car, strong odor of alcohol, red, watery, and glassy
eyes, starting too soon on the Walk-and-Turn test, and breath
test result of 0.105 grams of alcohol per 210 liter of breath, in
finding Tokunaga guilty of OVUII.  We conclude that when viewed
in the light most favorable to the State, there was sufficient
evidence to support the district court's guilty verdict.  See
State v. Ildefonso, 72 Haw. 573, 576, 827 P.2d 648, 651 (1992)
(sufficiency of the evidence must be viewed in the light most
favorable to the State); State v. Eastman , 81 Hawai #i 131, 135,
913 P.2d 57, 61 (1996) ("The test on appeal is not whether guilt
[was] established beyond a reasonable doubt, but whether there
was substantial evidence to support the conclusion of the trier
of fact.").  See also , e.g., State v. Peters, (SDO) No. CAAP-16-
0000691, 2017 WL 4217004, 140 Hawai #i 435, *1, 402 P.3d 511, *1
(App. Sept. 22, 2017); State v. Ringor, (SDO) No. CAAP-16-
0000526, 2017 WL 2266882, 139 Hawai #i 562, *2, 394 P.3d 792, *2
(App. May 24, 2017).
(3) Since we are remanding the case, we need not
address the other arguments Tokunaga raises on appeal.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of
Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, entered by the
District Court of the First Circuit, # Ewa Division, on
November 22, 2016, is vacated, and the case is remanded for a new
trial.
