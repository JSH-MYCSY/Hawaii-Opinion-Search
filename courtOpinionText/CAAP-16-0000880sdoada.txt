IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
JP, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
YB, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
(FC-D NO. 12-1-0132)
  
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Chan, JJ.)
 
This appeal arises from divorce proceedings between
 
Defendant-Appellant, YB (Wife), and Plaintiff-Appellee, JP
 
(Husband). 
Wife appeals from the Decree Granting Absolute
 
Divorce, filed on October 26, 2016, by the Family Court of the
 Third Circuit (family court),
1 which dissolved the marriage of
 
Husband and Wife, awarded joint legal custody and primary
 physical custody with respect to their minor child and related
 child support and child support arrears to Wife, and ordered the
 division and distribution of the couple's property and debts. 
On appeal Wife contends that the family court erred (1)
 
by failing to list, divide, and distribute all known assets in
 its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, filed on July 26,
 2016 (FOFCOL), (2) by relying on Husband's Income and Expense
 Statements without verification of responsive exhibits, (3) in
 its determination of child support arrears, and (4) by entering a

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Divorce Decree that was inconsistent with its FOFCOL. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Wife's
 points of error as follows. 
(1) Wife contends that the family court erred when it 
failed to divide all of the parties' marital assets. Wife claims that the family court only listed four retirement and securities accounts as marital assets in its FOFCOL: (1) Fidelity Investments 401K, (2) Operating Engineers Trust Fund Pension, (3) Symetra Retirement Account, and (4) Husband's deceased mother's State of Hawai' i Employees' Retirement System (ERS) Pension Plan 
in which husband is the named beneficiary (Husband's ERS pension). Additionally, in its FOFCOL, the family court determined that the marital estate contains no marital separate property. Of the above listed assets, the family court incorporated the Fidelity Investments 401K, Operating Engineers Trust Fund Pension, and Symetra Retirement Account in its Divorce Decree for division and distribution. The Divorce Decree also awarded Husband a share of Wife's State of Hawai' i ERS Pension 
Plan (Wife's ERS pension), an asset that was not included in the FOFCOL.
2 
Wife asserts that the family court failed to identify,
 
divide and distribute Husband's Gasco, Inc. pension plan and
 Gasco, Inc. grievance pay. Husband agrees that the Gasco, Inc.
 Pension Plan was excluded from the family court's FOFCOL and
 Divorce Decree and concedes that this asset should be divided and
 distributed. Failure to include a specific disposition of
 Husband's pension plan was in error. As for Husband's Gasco,
 Inc. grievance pay, Wife asserts that only the net amount of the
 
2
 Wife contends that the family court erroneously divided her State of
Hawai'i ERS pension because it was not listed as a marital asset in the family
court's FOFCOL and therefore, should not have been subject to division in the
Divorce Decree. However, this argument is without merit and we conclude thatthe family court did not err when it divided Wife's ERS pension. See Stouffer 
v. Stouffer, 10 Haw. App. 267, 277, 867 P.2d 226, 231 (1994) ("In Hawai'i
divorce cases, the family court usually divides the employed party's
retirement benefits from the employer by awarding the other party one-half of
a percentage of all retirement payments if, as and when made.") 
2
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
grievance pay was subject to allocation by the family court and
 
that the 401K contribution was not divided. Husband argues that
 the family court divided the total net amount received as part of
 the arbitration award without adjustment for the "401K deduction"
 and that an adjustment by the Court would result in Wife owing
 $2,702.44. From the record, it is unclear whether or how the
 family court addressed the 401K contribution, however, the 401K
 contribution should have been allocated for division and
 distribution. On remand, the family court is directed to amend
 the FOFCOL and Divorce Decree to include (1) Husband's Gasco,
 Inc. pension plan and (2) its determination as to whether the
 401K contribution for Husband's Gasco, Inc.'s grievance pay was
 subjected to allocation and, if not, make adjustments to the
 division of assets accordingly. 
Wife argues that the family court erred by failing to
 
divide Husband's ERS pension. Husband argues that the family
 court did not err because Husband's ERS pension should be
 identified as an inheritance rather than a retirement asset and
 is therefore not subject to division. FOF 14 provides that
 "[Husband's] mother died during the marriage of the parties. 
[Husband] was his mother's beneficiary of her [ERS] pension, and
 since her death has received a monthly check. [Husband] has not
 made a Category 3 claim with regard to those funds."
3 Further,

 “Hawai'i law follows a partnership model that governs the division and
distribution of marital partnership property.” Gordon v. Gordon, 135 Hawai 'i 
340, 352, 350 P.3d 1008, 1020 (2015) (citing Helbush v. Helbush, 108 Hawai 'i 
508, 513, 122 P.3d 288, 293, (App.2005)). This court has divided property into
five categories: 
Category 1: The net market value (NMV), plus or minus, of
all property separately owned by one spouse on the date of
marriage (DOM) but excluding the NMV attributable to
property that is subsequently legally gifted by the owner to
the other spouse, to both spouses, or to a third party.
 
Category 2: The increase in the NMV of all property whose NMV on
the DOM is included in category 1 and that the owner separately
owns continuously from the DOM to the date of the conclusion of
the evidentiary part of the trial (DOCOEPOT).
 
Category 3: The date-of-acquisition NMV, plus or minus, of
property separately acquired by gift or inheritance during the
marriage but excluding the NMV attributable to property that is
subsequently legally gifted by the owner to the other spouse, to
both spouses, or to a third party.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
the family court listed Husband's ERS pension as a marital asset
 
and concluded that the marital estate contained no separate
 property. However, Husband's ERS pension is not included in the
 Divorce Decree and was not allocated for division and
 distribution. The failure to include specific disposition of
 Husband's ERS pension was in error. On remand, the family court
 is directed to amend the Divorce Decree to include its
 determination on the division of Husband's ERS pension. 
(2) Wife challenges the family court's FOFs 15-26 and
 
COLs 8-10, contending that the family court erred in its
 determination of Husband's income thereby utilizing erroneous
 income values in its determination of child support arrears. 
Wife argues that the family court improperly relied solely on
 Husband's Income and Expense Statements to make its
 determinations and failed to verify Husband's actual income by
 considering all of the exhibits entered into evidence, including
 pay stubs, tax records, awards documentation, and other
 institutional records. 
A family court's findings of fact are reviewed under 
the "clearly erroneous" standard. In re Doe, 101 Hawai' i 220, 
227, 65 P.3d 167, 174 (2003); In re Jane Doe, 84 Hawai' i 41, 46, 
928 P.2d 883, 888 (1996). Under this standard, a finding of fact will not be disturbed unless "(1) the record lacks substantial evidence to support the finding, or (2) despite substantial evidence in support of the finding, the appellate court is nonetheless left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made." In re Doe, 101 Hawai' i at 227, 65 P.3d 
at 174 (quoting State v. Okumura, 78 Hawai' i 383, 392, 894 P.2d 
80, 89 (1995)). "Substantial evidence" is defined as "credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to

the date of acquisition during the marriage is included in
category 3 and that the owner separately owns continuously from
the date of acquisition to the DOCOEPOT.

property owned by one or both of the spouses on the DOCOEPOT minus
the NMVs, plus or minus, includable in categories 1, 2, 3 and 4.

A family court's conclusions of law "are reviewed on
 
appeal de novo, under the right/wrong standard . . . [and]
 consequently, are 'not binding upon an appellate court and are
 freely reviewable for their correctness.'" Fisher v. Fisher, 111
 
Hawai'i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 (2006) (quoting In re Doe, 95 
Hawai'i 183, 190, 20 P.3d 616, 623 (2001)). A conclusion of law 
“that presents mixed questions of fact and law is reviewed under
 the clearly erroneous standard because the court's conclusions
 are dependent upon the facts and circumstances of each individual
 case.” Chun v. Bd. of Trs. of Employees' Ret. Sys., 106 Hawai‘i

The family court issued the following relevant Findings
 
of Fact (FOF) and Conclusions of Law (COL) on July 26, 2016:
 
Findings of Fact
15. Child support was first awarded in an order filed
on September 20, 2012. [Husband] was ordered to pay $1,052
per month, commencing on June 1, 2012.
16. [Husband] was injured in an industrial accident in
October, 2012 resulting in a reduction of his income.
Effective October 15, 2012 [Husband's] child support
obligation was reduced to $594 per month.
17. A Stipulation Pertaining to Child Custody,
Visitation and Child Support; Order Approving Stipulation
was filed on April 16, 2013. The stipulated order adopted
the earlier $594 per month child support obligation but
added a provision that the parties would each be responsible
for one half of the minor child's unreimbursed medical
 expenses and one half of the travel expenses associated with
her extracurricular activities.
 
18. On March 4, 2014 [Husband] filed a motion seeking
to further amend his child support obligation. The motion
 alleged that his income changed because he was suspended
without pay from his job at Hawaii Gas.
19. [Husband's] Income and Expense Statement filed on
March 3, 2014 stated that his total monthly income was
$2,292.
20. On November 24, 2015, the Court entered an order
amending [Husband's] child support obligation to $475 per month,
effective March 1, 2014. The order provided, however, "Should
[Husband's] income change, the parties agree that [Husband] would
not need to file a motion and [Husband's] child support shall be
adjusted retroactive to the date of the change of [Husband's]
pay." 
21. No subsequent child support motion or order has been
 
filed.
 
22. [Husband's] next Income and Expense Statement was filed
on April 7, 2014. Exhibit 28. His monthly gross Income then was
$3,689.
23. [Husband] filed another Income and Expense Statement on
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
July 2, 2014. Exhibit 31. His monthly gross income then was
$3,447.
24. [Husband's] last Income and Expense Statement prior to
trial was filed on January 8, 2016. His monthly gross income at
that time was $5,750.
25. Exhibit 40 is a copy of [Husband's] pay stub for the
period ending August 30, 2015. It reflects a pay increase of $2
for each pay period over the pay he was receiving at the time he
filed the July 2, 2014 Income and Expense Statement.
26. Aside from [Husband's] Income and Expense Statements and
[Husband's] Exhibit 40 there is nothing in the exhibits admitted
at trial or the testimony of the parties that reflects any date of
change of [Husband's] pay.
 
Conclusions of Law
 
8. The parties stipulated to and the Court adopted a
procedure for amending [Husband's] child support obligation
as his income changed during the course of this litigation.
That stipulation was effective March 1, 2014 and that child
support amount was based on [Husband's] monthly income of
$2,292 set forth in {Husband's] Income and Expense Statement
filed on March 3, 2014. Since that date the evidence
establishes that [Husband] income increased to $3,689 by
April 7, 2014 (Exhibit 28), decreased to $3,447 on July 2,
2014 (Exhibit 31), and increased again to $5,750 by
January 8, 2016 (Exhibit 34).
9. Based on the exhibits admitted at trial and the
 
testimony of the parties, [Wife's] income was $5,558 on both
April 7, and July 2, 2014 (Exhibit I and N), and had
increased to about $6,000 per month by the date of trial.
[Wife] is entitled to a credit of $285 on the Child Support
Guidelines Worksheets for the cost of providing medical
insurance for the child. 
10. [Husband's] resulting child support obligations,
effective April 7, 2014, July 2, 2014, and January 8, 2016
are set forth in Exhibits A, B, and C, respectively,
attached hereto, and by this reference incorporated in the
findings and conclusions.
 
Wife specifically argues that Husband's Income and
 
Expense Statements did not consistently include, as income,
 
Husband's ERS pension payments, nor did the statements include
 withdrawals from his retirement and/or securities accounts,
 income from unemployment benefits, worker's compensation benefits
 and monetary awards. However, the record does not support Wife's
 argument. 
On November 30, 2012, the family court entered an Order
 
Reducing Child Support and Concerning Other Matters, where the
 parties stipulated to reduce Husband's child support payments to
 $594.00 effective as of October 15, 2012, due to his work related
 accident and as a result being placed on worker's compensation.
 The reduced child support was subject to verification by Husband
 supplying documentation to Wife as to the amount of worker's
 compensation payments being received. On April 16, 2013, the
 
6
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
parties submitted a Stipulation Pertaining to Child Custody,
 
Visitation and Child Support stating that the existing child
 support order would remain in place, indicating that Husband had
 verified the amount of his worker's compensation to the
 satisfaction of Wife. 
Additionally, according to COL 10, it appears that the
 
family court, in its calculation of Husband's child support
 obligations, considered Husband's Income and Expense Statements
 filed on April 7, 2014, July 2, 2014, and January 8, 2016. The
 foregoing Income and Expense Statements included Husband's ERS
 Pension payments as other regular monthly income and were
 therefore, included in the calculation of Husband's total monthly
 income for purposes of child support calculations.
 
In regards to the inclusion of Husband's monetary 
awards, the Divorce Decree awards Wife half of Husband's grievance pay award. Further, pursuant to the July 26, 2016 Order Regarding Arbitration Award, Husband is to place all funds received by him from his arbitration award into an escrow account until further order of the family court, thereby making the inclusion of these awards as Husband's income unnecessary. See Collins v. Wassell, 133 Hawai' 34, 42 323 P.3d 1216, 1224 (2014) 
("Consistent with the wide discretion bestowed on the family court, [Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 580-47] provides that upon granting a divorce, the family court may 'make any further orders as shall appear just and equitable . . . finally dividing and distributing the estate of the parties, real, personal, or mixed, whether community, joint, or separate.'"). 
Finally, Wife points to nothing in the record to
 
support her argument that Husband did not include his
 unemployment benefits or his worker's compensation benefits in
 his Income and Expense Statements. 
Given the family court's "wide discretion in making its 
decision," Fisher, 111 Hawai' i at 46, 137 P.3d at 360, we 
conclude that there is sufficient evidence in the record to support the family court's FOFs 15-26 and COLs 8-10. Further, there is no indication that the family court did not consider all the exhibits entered into evidence, the testimony of both Husband 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
and Wife, and the arguments advanced by both parties in its
 
determination of Husband's income for purposes of child support
 calculations. Id. ("It is well-settled that an appellate court
 
will not pass upon issues dependent upon the credibility of
 witnesses and the weight of evidence; this is the province of the
 trier of fact.") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
(3) Wife contends that the family court erred by
 
relying on Exhibit "KKK" to determine the amount of Husband's
 child support arrears, instead of calculating the child support
 arrears based on its FOFCOL. 
Exhibit "KKK", which was stipulated into evidence by 
the parties, consisted of a print out from the State of Hawai' i 
Department of the Attorney General of the child support arrears obligation owed by Husband, as of February 2, 2016, in the amount of $14,589.34. Although the parties had agreed to this exhibit being entered into evidence, neither party provided documentation as to the calculation of this amount and it is unclear what values were relied upon in determining this obligation amount. 
The family court issued the following FOFCOLs regarding
 
Exhibit "KKK" and the calculation of amended child support
 arrears:
 
Findings of Fact
27. As of February 2, 2016 [Husband] owed [Wife] child
support arrears in the amount of $14,589.34. (Exhibit KKK).
However, [Husband] made direct payments of child support to
[Wife] totaling $5,161, reducing his arrears to $9,428.34.
28. Exhibit KKK does not, however, provide a monthly
accounting of [Husband's] payments so it is impossible for
the Court to adjust the arrears to conform to child support
amendments made here.
 
Conclusions of Law
 
10. [Husband's] resulting child support obligations,
effective April 7, 2014, July 2, 2014, and January 8, 2016
are set forth in Exhibit A, B, and C, respectively, attached
hereto, and by this reference incorporated in the findings
and conclusions.
 
11. [Wife] is entitled to recalculate the back child
support owing to her based upon the amended child support
calculations set forth herein.
 
Exhibits A, B, and C, that were attached to the FOFCOL
 
are Child Support Guideline Worksheets used by the family court
 
to calculate Husband and Wife's child support obligations based
 on its findings as to the determination of the parties' monthly
 income.
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Decree Granting Absolute Divorce is consistent with
 
the family court's FOFCOL and does not appear to rely on
 
Husband's obligation as set forth in Exhibit "KKK":
 
4. Child Support:
a. Commencing April 7, 2014, [Husband's] child support
obligation shall be $491, per month.
b. Commencing July 2, 2014, [Husband's] child support
obligation shall be $456, per month.
c. Commencing January 8, 2016, [Husband's] child
support obligation shall be $758, per month.
d. [Husband] shall be provided credit of $5,161, for
direct child support payments made directly to [Wife].
e. Child Support Enforcement Agency shall adjust their
records accordingly pursuant to this instant Divorce Decree.
 
Furthermore, the family court ordered the Child Support
 Enforcement Agency to recalculate and adjust their records based
 on the family court's determination as to Husband's amended child
 support obligation. Accordingly, we hold that the family court
 did not err in its determination of child support arrears. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that, to the extent
 
that the family court failed to identify, divide and distribute
 all known marital assets, the Decree Granting Absolute Divorce
 entered by the Family Court of the Third Circuit, is vacated. 
The case is remanded to the family court for further proceedings
 consistent with this order.
