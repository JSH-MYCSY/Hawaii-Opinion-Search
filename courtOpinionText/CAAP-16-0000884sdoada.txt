APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 11-1-0358)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Ginoza, C.J., Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
Defendants-Appellants Brooke Juliet Carlina Riopta, 
Amber Megan Riopta, and Casie Ann Riopta (collectively, the
Rioptas) appeal from the foreclosure Judgment entered on November
28, 2016, in the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit1 (circuit
court), in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee Wilmington Savings Fund
Society, FSB, doing business as Christiana Trust, not in its
individual capacity, but solely as trustee for Pretium Mortgage
1  The Honorable Kathleen N.A. Watanabe presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Acquisition Trust ( Wilmington Savings).  The Rioptas also
challenge the "Findings of Fact; Conclusions of Law; Order
Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment as Against All
Defendants and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure" (Summary
Judgment Order ) entered on November 28, 2016.  
On appeal, the Rioptas contend that the circuit court
erred: (1) because a genuine issue of material fact exists as to
whether the subject loan was rescinded pursuant to the Truth in
Lending Act; (2) by granting summary judgment to Wilmington
Savings based on hearsay evidence; and (3) by not continuing the
summary judgment motion to accommodate the Rioptas' request for
additional time under Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP)
Rule 56(f).
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve the
Rioptas' points of error as follows, and we vacate and remand.
The Hawai #i Supreme Court's decision in Bank of 
America, N.A. v. Reyes–Toledo, 139 Hawai #i 361, 390 P.3d 1248
(2017) is dispositive in this case.  In Reyes-Toledo, the supreme
court held in a judicial foreclosure action that in order to
establish a right to foreclose, the foreclosing plaintiff must
establish standing, or entitlement to enforce the subject note,
at the time the action was commenced.  139 Hawai# i at 367-70, 390
P.3d at 1254-57.  The supreme court stated, inter alia , that a
foreclosing plaintiff must typically "prove the existence of an
agreement, the terms of the agreement, a default by the mortgagor
under the terms of the agreement, and giving of the cancellation
notice."  Id. at 367, 390 P.3d at 1254 (citing Bank of Honolulu,
N.A. v. Anderson, 3 Haw. App. 545, 551, 654 P.2d 1370, 1375
(1982)).  The supreme court also expressed that "[a] foreclosing
plaintiff's burden to prove entitlement to enforce the note
overlaps with the requirements of standing in foreclosure actions
as 'standing is concerned with whether the parties have the right
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
to bring suit.'"  Id.  (brackets omitted) (quoting Mottl v.
Miyahira, 95 Hawai# i 381, 388, 23 P.3d 716, 723 (2001)).  "As
standing relates to the invocation of the court's jurisdiction,
it is not surprising that standing must be present at the
commencement of the case."  Id.  at 368, 390 P.3d at 1255
(citation omitted).  In concluding that the foreclosing bank
failed to satisfy its burden as the movant for summary judgment,
the court reasoned, "[a]lthough Bank of America produced evidence
that it possessed the blank-indorsed Note at the time it sought
summary judgment, a material question of fact exists as to
whether Bank of America possessed the Note, or was otherwise a
holder, at the time it brought the foreclosure action."  Id. at
370, 390 P.3d at 1257.
In this case, the Complaint was filed by Citimortgage,
Inc. (Citimortgage) on December 14, 2011.  The Complaint alleged,
inter alia , that Brooke Riopta and Amber Riopta executed a
promissory note in favor of ABN AMRO Mortgage Group, Inc. ( ABN
AMRO), that on September 1, 2007, ABN AMRO merged with
Citimortgage, that there was a default, and that "[Citimortgage]
is entitled to the foreclosure of the Mortgage and to the sale of
the property."  A copy of the Note, showing ABN AMRO as the
lender, is attached to the Complaint.
On April 25, 2012, Citimortgage filed a "Motion for
Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure Against All
Defendants" ( Citimortgage Summary Judgment Motion ).  In support
of this motion was a Declaration of Indebtedness by Angela
Dobrick ( Dobrick), who attested she was authorized to execute the
declaration on behalf of Citimortgage and that she was a
"Document Control Officer."  Dobrick's declaration, executed on
March 21, 2012, stated in relevant part that Citimortgage records
"contain a Note executed by Brooke Juliet Carlina Riopta and
Amber Megan Riopta [sic]" and that "[Citimortgage] is the
servicer of the loan and holds the Note ."  (Emphasis added.)  A
copy of the Note attached as Exhibit "1" again reflects ABN AMRO
as the lender and there does not appear to be any endorsements on
the Note. 
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
The record reflects that there was no ruling on the
Citimortgage Summary Judgment Motion.  Rather, on February 11,
2016, Wilmington Savings filed a motion for substitution and
amendment of case caption to substitute Wilmington Savings for
Citimortgage as the plaintiff and real party in interest.  On
March 8, 2016, an order granting the substitution of Wilmington
Savings for Citimortgage was entered.
On June 17, 2016, Wilmington Savings filed a "Motion
for Summary Judgment as Against All Defendants and for
Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure" (Wilmington Savings Summary
Judgment Motion ).  Attached to this motion was, inter alia, a
"Declaration of Plaintiff In Support of Motion" executed on June
7, 2016, by Dawn Berry ( Berry), an Assistant Vice President of
Selene Finance LP (Selene Finance ), the "servicer" for Wilmington
Savings.  Berry attested in pertinent part that "Plaintiff is now
the owner and holder of the Note and the Mortgage."  (Emphasis
added).
Like in Reyes-Toledo, the evidence in this case fails
to demonstrate that the original plaintiff, Citimortgage, was
entitled to enforce the Note when this action was commenced. 
None of the declarations attest that Citimortgage had the right
to enforce the Note at the time it filed the Complaint.2 
Although the Complaint alleges that Citimortgage was entitled to
foreclose because it had merged with ABN AMRO on September 1,
2007, there is no admissible evidence establishing these facts or
any alternative basis for Citimortgage's right to foreclose under
the Note when the Complaint was filed.3
2  Because the declarations submitted by Dobrick and Berry do not
discuss Citimortgage's right to foreclose under the Note at the time the
Complaint was filed, we need not address whether the declarations are
appropriate to authenticate the pertinent records under U.S. Bank N.A. v.
Mattos, 140 Hawai #i 26, 398 P.3d 615 (2017).
3  Wilmington Savings submitted an Attorney Affirmation on June 17,
2016, the same day that its summary judgment motion was filed, which stated in
part that the Complaint contained no false statements of fact. However, an
attorney affirmation does not establish a lender's entitlement to enforce a
note. See U.S. Bank Tr., N.A. v. Busto, CAAP-16-0000334, 2017 WL 2579070 at *2
(Haw. App. June 14, 2017) (SDO) (with Ginoza, J., dissenting on grounds that a

Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the
Rioptas, as we must for purposes of a summary judgment ruling,
there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether
Citimortgage was entitled to enforce the Note at the time this
foreclosure action was commenced.  Therefore, the circuit court
erred in granting the Wilmington Savings Summary Judgment Motion.
Given the above, we need not address the Rioptas' other
points of error.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the following,
entered by the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit on November 28,
2016, are vacated: (1) the "Findings of Fact; Conclusions of Law;
Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment as Against
All Defendants and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure"; and
(2) Judgment.  This case is remanded to the circuit court for
further proceedings.
