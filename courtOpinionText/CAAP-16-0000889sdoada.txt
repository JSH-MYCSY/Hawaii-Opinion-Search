STATE OF HAWAI #I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
EUGENE HAN, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
WAI#ANAE DIVISION
(CASE NO. 1DTA-15-03467)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Ginoza, C.J., Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Eugene Han (Han ) appeals from the
"Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment,"
filed on December 2, 2016 in the District Court of the First
Circuit, Wai# anae Division ( District Court ).1
Han was convicted of Operating a Vehicle Under the
Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii
Revised Statutes (HRS ) ยง 291E-61(a)(1) (Supp. 2017).  
On appeal, Han contends the District Court: (1) plainly
erred by failing to rule on his pretrial motion to suppress prior
to trial; and (2) plainly erred by failing to conduct an adequate
Tachibana colloquy.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve Han's points of error as follows:
1/ The Honorable James C. McWhinnie presided.NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(1)  The District Court plainly erred by failing to
decide Han's October 9, 2015 "Motion to Suppress Statements or
Evidence of Defendant's Breath or Blood Test Because of Miranda
Violation" (Motion to Suppress ) prior to trial, because failure
to decide a motion to suppress prior to trial constitutes
reversible error unless the parties agree to consolidate the
hearing on the motion with trial.  Hawai #i Rules of Penal
Procedure ( HRPP) Rule 12(e); State v. Thomas , 72 Haw. 48, 53-54,
805 P.2d 1212, 1214-15 (1991) (citations omitted) (recognizing
plain error).  However, Han claimed a Miranda warning was
required to be given to him because he was in custody and was
subjected to custodial interrogation when the police advised him
of the implied consent law and told him that he had a choice of
taking a blood alcohol test or refusing.  Han requested that
statements made during custodial interrogation regarding his
consent to testing and the result of any subsequent testing be
suppressed due to lack of a Miranda  warning.  No evidence of a
breath or blood test, or statements by Han regarding a breath or
blood test, was elicited at trial.  Therefore, the error in
failing to rule on the motion to suppress was harmless.
(2)  The District Court plainly erred by failing to
conduct an adequate Tachibana colloquy.  During the Tachibana
colloquy, the District Court did not obtain a response by Han
that he understood the rights that were recited to him, and Han's
only response was that it was his decision not to testify.   The
record does not establish that the requirements for a "true
colloquy" were met.  State v. Celestine, 142 Hawai #i 165, 171-73,
415 P.3d 907, 913-15 (2018), State v. Chong Hung Han, 130 Hawai #i
83, 90-91, 306 P.3d 128, 135-36 (2013), State v. Pomroy , 132
Hawai#i 85, 93, 319 P.3d 1093, 1101 (2014).  Answering that it
was his decision not to testify does not cure the inadequacy of
the colloquy.  Celestine , 142 Hawai #i at 172, 415 P.3d at 914. 
The State argues that Han's responses during the
pretrial advisement satisfies the Tachibana  colloquy requirement. 
During the pretrial advisement, however, Han was not asked and he
did not state that he understood the advisement as to his right

to testify.  Specifically, the pretrial advisement did not
ascertain whether Han understood his right to testify, that no
one could prevent him from testifying, and that he would be
subject to cross examination if he testified.  Tachibana v.
State, 79 Hawai #i 226, 236, 900 P.2d 1293, 1303 (1995); see also
State v. Eduwensuyi, 141 Hawai #i 328, 334, 409 P.3d 732, 738
(2018)(holding that a pretrial advisement did not cure a
deficient ultimate colloquy).
"Once a violation of the constitutional right to
testify is established, the conviction must be vacated unless the
State can prove that the violation was harmless beyond a
reasonable doubt."  Tachibana , 79 Hawai #i at 240, 900 P.2d at
1307 (citation omitted).  "[I]t is inherently difficult, if not
impossible, to divine what effect a violation of the defendant's
constitutional right to testify had on the outcome of any
particular case."  State v. Hoang , 94 Hawai #i 271, 279, 12 P.3d
371, 379 (2000) (citation omitted).  Therefore, the error was not
harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Notice of
Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment," filed on
December 2, 2016 in the District Court of the First Circuit,
Wai#anae Division, is vacated.  The case is remanded for a new
trial.
