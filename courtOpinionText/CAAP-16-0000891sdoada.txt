ML, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v. 
HL, Defendant-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(FC-D. NO. 11-1-0899) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Plaintiff-Appellant ML (
Husband) appeals from the 
"Decision and Order After Remand" entered by the Family Court of 
the First Circuit1 on December 1, 2016. For the reasons 
explained below, we affirm the Decision and Order After Remand in 
part; vacate the Decision and Order After Remand in part; and remand this case to the family court for clarification of the reimbursement or payment obligations of the parties, and for entry of an amended property division chart. 
BACKGROUND 
Husband filed for a divorce from Defendant-Appellee HL 
(Wife) on May 27, 2011. After a trial, a "Decision and Order" 
was entered on January 7, 2014. Attached to the Decision and 
Order was a property division chart dated January 3, 2014 (2014 
Property Division Chart). An "Amended Decision and Order" was 
entered on January 10, 2014. The 2014 Property Division Chart 
1 The Honorable Catherine H. Remigio presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
was attached to the Amended Decision and Order. A divorce decree 
was entered on March 4, 2014. The decree required that Husband pay to Wife an equalization payment of $128,987.87. 
Husband appealed. The family court entered findings of 
fact and conclusions of law on August 12, 2014 (2014 Findings & 
Conclusions). The 2014 Property Division Chart was attached to 
the 2014 Findings & Conclusions. We temporarily remanded the 
case to allow the family court to amend the divorce decree. On September 15, 2015, the family court entered an order amending the divorce decree, and amended the findings of fact and con-clusions of law relating to Husband's child support obligation. 
The case then returned to us and we issued a summary 
disposition order, MHL v. HJKL, No. CAAP-14-0000697, 2016 WL 806200 (App. Mar. 1, 2016) (SDO) (First SDO).  We noted: 
[Husband] contends that the family court abused its
discretion by declining to award [him] a Category 3 creditfor a portion of his Schwab One account. [Husband] contendsthat he deposited a $136,254 gift or inheritance receivedfrom [his mother]'s revocable trust after [his mother]'sdeath in 2008 into the investment account. 
Id. at *5. We also noted: 
This is generally in line with [Husband's father]'stestimony that he believed [Husband] had received around$90,000 from [Husband's mother]'s trust, which was depositedin [Husband]'s account. 
Id. The family court did not award Husband any Category 3 credit 
for his inheritance from his mother's trust. We concluded that 
the family court erred in denying [Husband] any Category 3credit. While the family court was entitled to exercise its
discretion in the valuation of the Category 3 claim, itshould not have awarded [Husband] no credit. On remand, wedirect the family court to use the available evidence todetermine a reasonable value for [Husband]'s Category 3claim. 
Id. at *6 (first underscore in original, second underscore 
added). We otherwise affirmed the divorce decree and the order amending it. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On remand the family court issued an order stating, in 
relevant part: 
Counsel shall submit memorandum [sic] supporting each
party's position regarding a reasonable value for[Husband]'s Category 3 claim. Exhibits shall be limited to evidence available at trial. 
Husband submitted a trial exhibit showing the balance of his 
mother's investment account to have been around $250,000 when she died. Husband and his sister were the account beneficiaries; accordingly, he claimed half of the balance, or $125,000. Alternatively, he argued, because we had recognized there had been a $200,000 withdrawal from his mother's account after the date of her death, "at a minimum [he] should receive a credit of $100,000[,] which is also consistent to [sic] [his father]'s testimony that [he] had received around $90,000" after his mother's death. Husband did not submit evidence showing any actual deposit into his Schwab One account. 
Wife also submitted a memorandum and exhibits. She 
pointed out there were no trial exhibits showing when Husband's inheritance was deposited into his Schwab One account, or what the value was at that time. The only evidence was Husband's father's testimony that about $90,000 was deposited into Husband's Schwab One account after Husband's mother died. Wife then argued there should be a $90,000 deviation based upon the Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 580-47(a) equitable 
considerations. 
The Decision and Order After Remand was entered on 
December 1, 2016. The family court found that the amount of 
Husband's inheritance was $90,000; recognized equitable con-siderations justifying a departure from the marital partnership model; and ordered a deviation of $70,000 in favor of Wife. 
Husband filed this appeal. The family court entered 
findings of fact and conclusions of law on January 31, 2017 (2017 
Findings & Conclusions). The family court ordered that Wife 
reimburse Husband $20,000 of the "$129,987.87 [sic]" equalization 
amount at the rate of no less than $5,000 per calendar year or, if Husband had not yet paid the equalization amount, the amount 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
was adjusted to "$109,987.87 [sic]." The family court did not 
amend the 2014 Property Division Chart or attach an amended property division chart to the 2017 Findings & Conclusions. 
DISCUSSION 
Husband's statement of the points of error does not 
comply with Rule 28(b)(4) of the Hawai# i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure. Husband appears to argue that: (1) the family court 
disregarded our mandate by applying equitable considerations to 
reduce the amount of Husband's Category 3 credit or, even if equitable considerations were properly recognized, none of them justified deviation from the marital partnership model of property division; (2) the family court erred by granting Wife 
four years to repay Husband's excess equalization payment; and
(3)
 Wife's request for attorneys' fees should have been denied 
because it was contrary to the family court's previous ruling 
that each party pay their own fees. 
1. The family court did not err by
recognizing equitable considerations. 
Husband contends that the family court "exceeded the 
scope of [the] narrow remand — to determine a reasonable value 
for [Husband]'s Category 3 claim — when it deviated from partner-ship principles based on equitable considerations never addressed in the original divorce proceedings or listed in the 2014 Find-
ings." 
"Equitable considerations" justifying a deviation from 
marital partnership principles are also referred to as "valid and relevant considerations" and "valid and relevant circumstances," or "VARCs," by 
Hawai# i courts. Gordon v. Gordon
, 135 Hawai# i 340, 
349 n.15, 350 P.3d 1008, 1017 n.15 (2015). 
The 
First SDO recognized that "the family court was 
entitled to exercise its discretion in the valuation of the Category 3 claim," but "it should not have awarded [Husband] no credit." First SDO, at *6. Our mandate to the family court was 
"to use the available evidence to determine a reasonable value for [Husband]'s Category 3 claim" for the inheritance from his mother. Id. Category 3 net market values "are to be repaid to 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the contributing spouse absent equitable considerations justify-
ing a deviation." Gordon
, 135 Hawai# i at 349, 350 P.3d at 1017 
(underscoring added) (footnote and citations omitted). To divide Category 3 property the family court must: (1) find the facts 
necessary for assignment of the relevant net market value (NMV);
(2)
 identify any equitable considerations justifying deviation 
from total repayment to the contributing spouse; (3) decide 
whether or not there will be a deviation; and (4) decide the 
extent of any deviation. See id. at 350, 350 P.3d at 1018. To 
comply with our mandate the family court was required, after 
determining the NMV of Husband's inheritance from his mother, to identify any equitable considerations justifying a deviation from the marital partnership principle of crediting Husband with all of his inheritance, decide whether or not there will be a deviation and, if so, decide the amount of any deviation. 
Husband contends that Wife waived all equitable 
considerations because she did not raise them before the family court, or with us during Husband's first appeal. We disagree. The family court considered Husband's interest in his father's irrevocable trust "as a valid and relevant consideration in deviating from the Partnership Model[,]" First SDO, at *5 n.7, and noted the VARC in Part E of the 2014 Property Division Chart. There was no reason for the family court to consider any equitable considerations related to Husband's inheritance from his mother before the last remand because the family court did not award Husband "any Category 3 credit" for the inheritance. First SDO, at *5-6. 
Husband also contends that Wife is barred from raising 
equitable considerations by the doctrine of res judicata. Res judicata, or claim preclusion, is a legal doctrine that limits a party to one opportunity to litigate a claim to prevent incon-sistent results among multiple suits, and to promote finality and judicial economy. Bremer v. Weeks
, 104 Hawai# i 43, 53, 85 P.3d 
150, 160 (2004). Claim preclusion "prohibits a party from relitigating a previously adjudicated cause of action." 
Id.
(citation omitted). 
The party asserting claim preclusion has the 
burden of establishing that (1) there was a final judgment on the 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
merits, (2) the parties to the action in question are the same or 
in privity with the parties in the original suit, and (3) the claim decided in the original suit is identical with the one presented in the action in question. Id. at 54, 85 P.3d at 161. 
Claim preclusion does not apply here because there was no final judgment on the merits in a previous suit between Husband and Wife. 
2. The family court did not abuse its
discretion by ordering payment over time. 
Husband contends the family court erred by granting 
Wife four years to repay Husband's excess equalization payment. 
[T]he family court possesses wide discretion in making itsdecisions and those decision[s] will not be set aside unlessthere is a manifest abuse of discretion. Thus, we will notdisturb the family court's decisions on appeal unless thefamily court disregarded rules or principles of law orpractice to the substantial detriment of a party litigantand its decision clearly exceeded the bounds of reason. 
Fisher v. Fisher , 111 Hawai# i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 (2006) 
(citation omitted). On the record before us, and subject to 
section 4. of this summary disposition order, we cannot say that the family court erred by ordering Wife to repay Husband's excess equalization payment over time. 
3. The family court did not
award attorneys' fees to Wife. 
Husband argues that the family court should have denied 
Wife's request for attorneys' fees because it was contrary to the 
family court's previous ruling that each party pay their own fees. 
The Decision and Order After Remand made no mention of 
attorneys' fees. The 2017 Findings & Conclusions — entered after Husband filed his notice of appeal — states: 
30. Upon the conclusion of this appeal, Wife intends
to request an award of attorney's [sic] fees as "just and
equitable" under the criteria of HRS § 580-47, namely: therespective merits of the parties, the relative abilities ofthe parties, the condition in which each party will be leftby the divorce, the burdens imposed upon either party forthe benefit of the children of the parties, the concealmentof or failure to disclose income or an asset, and all othercircumstances of the case. 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The family court did not award attorneys' fees to Wife. There is 
no basis for Husband's appeal on that point. 
4. The family court erred when it
calculated Husband's equalizationcredit and/or Wife's reimbursement amount. 
The family court must file, as part of its findings and 
conclusions, a property division chart. Gordon, 135 Hawai# i at 
351, 350 P.3d at 1019. The Decision and Order After Remand 
amended the division of marital partnership property, but the family court did not amend the 2014 Property Division Chart or attach an amended property division chart to its 2017 Findings & Conclusions. 
It also appears that the family court erred when it 
calculated the amount of Husband's Category 3 VARC credit, the amount of Wife's reimbursement obligation, or both. The Decisionand Order After Remand stated, among other things: 
 
2. The amount of [Husband]'s Category 3 inheritance
credit is $90,000.00.[sic] 
. . . . 
7. [T]he Court finds that there will be a deviation inthe amount of 
$70,000.00 in favor of [Wife]. 
8. In the event that [Husband] has already paid [Wife]the previously-ordered equalization amount of$129,987.87, [sic] [Wife] shall reimburse [Husband]$20,000.00 at the rate of no less than $5,000.00 totalper calendar year (January 1 through December 31),beginning January 1, 2017. 
(Underscoring in original.) The 2017 Findings & Conclusions 
stated, among other things: 
44. Based on the totality of the relevant and
credible evidence that was provided at trial, the Court
finds that there will be a deviation in the amount of $70,000 in favor of Wife. 
45. In the event that Husband has already paid Wife
the previously-ordered equalization amount of $129,987.87,then Wife shall reimburse Husband $20,000.00 at the rate ofno less than $5,000.00 total per calendar year (January 1through December 31), beginning January 1, 2017. . . . 
45(a). In the event that Husband has not paid Wife the
previously-ordered equalization amount of $129,987.87, saidamount is herein adjusted to $109,987.87. 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The 2014 Property Division Chart shows the equalization 
payment amount (Part B, line 4) as $128,987.87, not $129,987.87. 
Accordingly, we vacate those portions of the Decision and Order After Remand and the 2017 Findings & Conclusions that reflect an incorrect equalization payment amount; and remand this case to the family court for clarification of the payment or reimburse-ment obligations of the parties, and for entry of an amended property division chart.
