STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
GREGORY B. STOUTE, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
WAILUKU DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 2DCW-16-0000676)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Appellant-Defendant Gregory B. Stoute (Stoute) appeals
 
from the September 2, 2016 District Court of the Second Circuit,
 
Wailuku Division (District Court)1 Judgment and Notice of Entry
 
of Judgment (Judgment). After a bench trial, the District Court
 convicted Stoute of Promoting a Detrimental Drug in the Third
 Degree (Promoting Drugs 3), in violation of Hawaii Revised
 Statutes (HRS) § 712-1249(1) (2014),
2 and sentenced him to five
 
days in jail.
 
On appeal, Stoute contends that the District Court did
 
not obtain an on-the-record waiver of his constitutional right to
 counsel and did not obtain a valid waiver of Stoute's right to

Promoting a detrimental drug in the third
degree. (1) A person commits the offense of promoting
a detrimental drug in the third degree if the person
knowingly possesses any marijuana or any Schedule V
substance in any amount.
 
HRS § 712-1249.

testify in his own defense at trial. In addition, he argues
 
there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction.
 
Upon review of the record on appeal and the relevant
 
legal authorities, giving due consideration to the issues
 presented and the arguments raised by the parties, we resolve the
 issues presented as follows and reverse the District Court's
 Judgment. 
Stoute argues that insufficient evidence to support his
 
conviction for Promoting Drugs 3 was presented as the State
 failed to present evidence that he possessed "marijuana" as
 defined. 
The standard of review for sufficiency of the evidence is
well established; namely, whether, upon the evidence viewed
in the light most favorable to the prosecution and in full
recognition of the province of the trier of fact, the
evidence is sufficient to support a prima facie case so that
a reasonable mind might fairly conclude guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt. Sufficient evidence to support a prima
facie case requires substantial evidence as to every
material element of the offense charged. Substantial
 evidence as to every material element of the offense charged
is credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and
probative value to enable a person of reasonable caution to
support a conclusion. Under such a review, we give full play
to the right of the fact finder to determine credibility,
weigh the evidence, and draw justifiable inferences of fact.
 
State v. Grace, 107 Hawai' i 133, 139, 111 P.3d 28, 34 (App. 2005) 
(block quote format changed) (quoting State v. Ferrer,
 
95 Hawai' i 409, 422, 23 P.3d 744, 757 (App. 2001)). 
Promoting Drugs 3 requires proof of knowing possession
 
of "marijuana" in any amount.3
 
"Marijuana" means any part of the plant (genus)
cannabis, whether growing or not, including the seeds and
the resin, and every alkaloid, salt, derivative,
preparation, compound, or mixture of the plant, its seeds or
resin, except that, as used herein, "marijuana" does not
include hashish, tetrahydrocannabinol, and any alkaloid,
salt, derivative, preparation, compound, or mixture, whether
natural or synthesized, of terahydrocannabinol.
 
HRS § 712-1240 (2014).
 
The State agrees with Stoute's argument that the State
 
failed to establish that "marijuana" found in Stoute's possession
 
was from any part of the cannabis plant. Because this Court must
 "ascertain that the [prosecution's] confession of error is
 
3
 Possession of a "Schedule V" substance is also a violation of HRS
 
§ 712-1249, but Stoute was not charged with such possession.

supported by the record and well founded in law," State v. 
Fagaragan, 115 Hawai' i 364, 368, 167 P.3d 739, 743 (2007), we 
must conduct our own examination of the matter conceded by the State. 
Our review of the record confirms the State's
 
concession. Although the State attempted to establish that the
 presence of THC and cystolith fibers
4 in the "green vegetation"
 
recovered in evidence indicated it to be "marijuana," the State
 presented no evidence that said vegetation was "part of the plant
 (genus) cannabis" for purposes of HRS §§ 712-1240 and 712­1249(1). Therefore, there was insufficient evidence to support
 Stoute's conviction for Promoting Drugs 3. 
Our resolution in Stoute's favor makes it unnecessary
 
to address the other issues raised in his appeal.
 
For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the September 2,
 
2016 Judgment and Notice of Entry of Judgment entered by the
 District Court of the Second Circuit, Wailuku Division.
