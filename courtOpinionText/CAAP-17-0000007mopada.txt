IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v. 
 MARK IAN BOADO, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(FC-CR NO. 16-1-1452) 
MEMORANDUM OPINION 
(By: Reifurth, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Mark Ian Boado (Boado) appeals from 
the Sentence; Notice of Entry (Judgment) entered by the Family 
Court of the First Circuit (Family Court)  on December 7, 2016. 
Boado contends that the Family Court failed to engage him in the 
colloquy required by Tachibana v. State, 79 Hawai# i 226, 900 P.2d 
1293 (1995). The validity of a criminal defendant's waiver of the right to testify is a question of constitutional law reviewed 
under the right/wrong standard. State v. Celestine, 142 Hawai# i 
165, 169, 415 P.3d 907, 911 (2018). For the reasons explained below, we vacate the Judgment and remand to the Family Court for 
further proceedings. 1
I. 
Hawai #i law has historically protected both the right to
testify and the right not to testify. The right to testify
is guaranteed by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to theUnited States Constitution; the Hawai #i Constitution's 
parallel guarantees under article I, sections 5, 10, and 14; 
1 The Honorable Sherri L. Iha presided.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and HRS § 801–2. The right not to testify is guaranteed by
the United States Constitution's Fifth Amendment guaranteeagainst compelled testimony and the Hawai #i Constitution's 
parallel guarantee under article I, section 10. 
Celestine, 142 Hawai# i at 169, 415 P.3d at 911 (citations 
omitted). In Tachibana, the Hawai
#i Supreme Court established 
requirements that trial courts advise criminal defendants of the 
right to testify and obtain an on-the-record waiver of that 
right. 79 Hawai# i at 236, 900 P.2d at 1303. 
There are two components of the Tachibana requirement. 
The first is that the trial court inform the defendant: 
that he or she has a right to testify, that if he or she
wants to testify that no one can prevent him or her fromdoing so, and that if he or she testifies the prosecutionwill be allowed to cross-examine him or her. In connection with the privilege against self-incrimination, the defendantshould also be advised that he or she has a right not totestify and that if he or she does not testify then the jurycan be instructed about that right. 
Celestine, 142 Hawai# i at 170, 415 P.3d at 912 (citing Tachibana, 
79 Hawai# i
 at 236 n.7, 900 P.2d at 1303 n.7) (brackets omitted). 
In this case the Family Court engaged in the following exchange 
with Boado before jury selection: 
THE COURT: Okay. So let me just read you the
Tachibana instruction. Okay. 
So you have a –- you have a constitutional right to
testify in your own defense. Although you should consult
with your attorney regarding the decision to testify, it isyour decision, and no one can prevent you from testifyingshould you choose to do so. If you decide to testify, theState will be allowed to cross-examine you. 
You also have a constitutional right not to testify
and to remain silent. If you choose not to testify, theCourt cannot hold your silence against you in deciding yourcase. 
If you have not testified at the end of the trial, I
will briefly question you to make sure that it was yourdecision not to testify. 
Understand? 
[BOADO]: 
Yes, (indiscernible). 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(emphasis added). The Family Court did not inform Boado that if 
he did not testify, the jury would be advised that he has that 
constitutional right. 
The second component of the Tachibana requirement 
involves the court engaging in a "colloquy" with the defendant 
"in which the judge ascertains the defendant's understanding of 
the proceedings and of the defendant’s rights." Celestine, 142 
Hawai# i
 at 170, 415 P.3d at 912 (citation and emphasis omitted). 
The trial court must "elicit[ ] responses as to whether the defendant intends to not testify, whether anyone is forcing the 
defendant not to testify, and whether the decision to not testify 
is the defendant's." Id. at 170-171, 415 P.3d at 912-13 
(citation omitted). In this case the Family Court engaged in the 
following exchange with Boado after the defense rested: 
THE COURT: Okay. So as we discussed before the start 
of the trial, you have a constitutional right to testify in
your own defense. Although you should consult with yourattorney regarding the decision to testify, it was your --it is your decision and no one can prevent you fromtestifying should you choose to do so. If you decide totestify, the prosecutor will be allowed to cross-examineyou. 
In this case, you've decided not to testify; correct? 
(Indiscernible voices.) [BOADO]: Yes. THE COURT: Okay. Just to be clear, it is your
decision not to testify; right? 
[BOADO]: Yes. 
In this case, this exchange should have taken place before the 
defense rested. See Celestine, 142 Hawai# i at 170 & n.12, 415 
P.3d at 912 & n.12 (citations omitted). 
The Family Court did not 
ask Boado whether anyone was forcing him not to testify. The 
Family Court elicited Boado's responses to leading questions, 
rather than allowing Boado to articulate that he understood his 
rights and what he had decided to do. 
"In determining whether a waiver of the right to 
testify was voluntarily and intelligently made, this court looks 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to the totality of the facts and circumstances of each particular 
case." Id. at 171, 415 P.3d at 913 (citation omitted). Under 
the facts and circumstances described above, we hold that the 
Family Court did not engage Boado in a colloquy sufficient to 
inform Boado about his constitutional rights to testify or to not 
testify, and to elicit Boado's understanding of the proceedings 
and of his rights. Compare State v. Borge, No. CAAP-18-0000012, 
2019 WL 762419 (Haw. Ct. App. Feb. 21, 2019) (SDO) (holding that 
Tachibana colloquy was deficient), and State v. Goebel, No. CAAP-
15-0000701, 2018 WL 3135415 (Haw. Ct. App. June 27, 2018) (same), 
with State v. Martin, No. CAAP-14-0001090, 2019 WL 1435123 (Haw. 
Ct. App. Mar. 29, 2019) (SDO) (sufficient Tachibana colloquy), 
and State v. Horvath, No. CAAP-17-0000349, 2018 WL 3154778 (Haw. 
Ct. App. June 28, 2018), cert. rejected, No. SCWC-17-0000349, 
2018 WL 4659785 (Haw. Sept. 28, 2018) (same). 
For the foregoing reasons, the Sentence; Notice of 
Entry entered by the Family Court of the First Circuit on 
December 7, 2016, is vacated and this case is remanded to the 
Family Court for further proceedings.
