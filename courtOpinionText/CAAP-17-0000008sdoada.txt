STATE OF HAWAI #I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
PETER M. DODGE, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
KONA DIVISION
(CASE NO. 3DCW-16-0001356)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, and Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Peter M. Dodge appeals from a
Judgment and Notice of Entry of Judgment, entered on December 8,
2016, by the District Court of the Third Circuit, Kona Division
("District Court").1  The District Court convicted Dodge of one
count of Harassment, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes
("HRS") section 711-1106(1).2 
On appeal, Dodge argues that the District Court wrongly
convicted him (1) where the charge was fatally defective for
failing to include the requisite mens rea ; and (2) where the
court (a) erroneously allowed Officer Taniguchi to testify
regarding Dodge's statements made to him after the officer failed
to provide Dodge with warnings pursuant to Miranda v. Arizona ,
384 U.S. 436 (1966); (b) abused its discretion in precluding
1/The Honorable Margaret Masunaga presided.
2/HRS section 711-1106(1) (2014) provides, in relevant part, "A
person commits the offense of harassment if, with intent to harass, annoy, or
alarm any other person, that person . . . [s]trikes, shoves, kicks, or
otherwise touches another person in an offensive manner or subjects the other
person to offensive physical contact[.]"NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
Dodge from adducing evidence of Leah Martinez's bias, interest,
and motive to testify falsely on the ground that it went beyond
the scope of direct examination; (c) erroneously precluded Dodge
from adducing evidence of the complainant's prior bad acts, which
were relevant to Dodge's self-defense claim; and (d) erroneously
allowed Martinez to testify about her alleged fear of Dodge.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve Dodge's points of error as follows. 
Dodge argues that the charge was fatally defective for
failing to include the requisite mens rea .  The State concedes
that the charge was defective for omitting the mens rea  for the
offense; nonetheless, the State urges us to disregard controlling
case law and review the issue for plain error rather than hold
that the charge must be dismissed without prejudice.  
In State v. Apollonio , 130 Hawai #i 353, 355, 311 P.3d
676, 678 (2013), the oral charge against Apollonio for excessive
speeding did not include the requisite mens rea.  Apollonio did
not object.  Id.  He was convicted.  Id . at 356, 311 P.3d at 679. 
He appealed, and this court affirmed.  Id. at 356-57, 311 P.3d at
679-80.   
On certiorari, Apollonio argued that the charge could
not be "reasonably construed to state an offense" because it
failed to include the requisite state of mind and, therefore,
should be dismissed without prejudice.  Id. at 358, 311 P.3d at
681.  The Hawai #i Supreme Court agreed, holding that "[a] charge
that fails to charge a requisite state of mind cannot be
construed reasonably to state an offense and thus the charge is
dismissed without prejudice because it violated due process." 
Id. at 359, 311 P.3d at 682 (citing State v. Elliott , 77 Hawai #i
309, 313, 884 P.2d 372, 376 (1994)).  The supreme court did not
review the issue for plain error.
Apollonio has not been overruled and remains binding on
this court.  "Under the doctrine of stare decisis, where a legal
principle has been passed upon by the court of last resort, it is
the duty of all inferior tribunals to adhere to the decision,

until the decision has been reversed or overruled by the court of
last resort or altered by legislative enactment."  State v. Jim,
105 Hawai# i 319, 331, 97 P.3d 395, 407 (App. 2004) (quoting
Soderlund v. Admin. Dir. of Courts, 96 Hawai# i 114, 119 n.8, 26
P.3d 1214, 1219 n.8 (2001)) (brackets, internal quotation marks,
and ellipsis omitted) .  
Here, it is undisputed that the charge fails to set
forth the requisite mens rea  and the State provides no persuasive
argument as to why we should ignore binding precedent and instead
apply the plain error standard.  Therefore, pursuant to
Apollonio , the charge must be dismissed without prejudice, and we
need not reach Dodge's other points of error.  See State v.
Muller, CAAP-10-0000225, 2014 WL 444230, at *2 (Hawai #i App.
Jan. 31, 2014) (finding it unnecessary to reach remaining points
of error after addressing Apollonio 's application).
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment and
Notice of Entry of Judgment, entered on December 8, 2016, by the
District Court of the Third Circuit, Kona Division, is vacated
and the case remanded for proceedings consistent with this
opinion.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, February 26, 2018.
