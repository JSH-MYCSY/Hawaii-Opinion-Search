APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 13-1-002K)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Chan, JJ.)
In an appeal arising out of a foreclosure case,
Defendant-Appellant Mary Ann T. Brennan (Brennan) appeals from
the December 8, 2016 Judgment entered by the Circuit Court of the
Third Circuit (Circuit Court)1 on an order granting summary
judgment and a decree of foreclosure in favor of Plaintiff-
Appellee MTGLQ Investors, LP (MTGLQ), and against Brennan and
Defendant-Appellee Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems,
Inc., Solely as Nominee for Quicken Loans, Inc.
On appeal, Brennan challenges the Circuit Court's
decision to grant summary judgment in MTGLQ's favor, arguing that
there were genuine issues of material fact, including whether the
original plaintiff in this action, Bank of America, N.A. (BOA),
1The Honorable Melvin H. Fujino presided.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
had presented evidence that it was "the holder of the endorsed
note at the time the complaint was filed[.]"
In its answering brief, MTGLQ concedes that "there is
no evidence on record of the original plaintiff [BOA's] standing
as the holder of the original promissory note when the Complaint
for Foreclosure was filed on January 3, 2013" as required by the
Hawai#i Supreme Court's opinion in Bank of America, N.A. v.
Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai #i 361, 361-71, 390 P.3d 1248, 1248-1258
(2017) and asks this court to set aside the order granting
summary judgment, decree of foreclosure and the December 8, 2016
Judgment.
Based on the foregoing, we vacate (1) the "Findings of
Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion
for Summary Judgment for Foreclosure Against Defendant Mary
Ann T. Brennan and Default Judgment against Defendant Mortgage
Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., Solley [sic] as Nominee
for Quicken Loans, Inc., and for Interlocutory Decree of
Foreclosure[,]" and (2) the Judgment, both entered on December 8,
2016, and remand this case to the Circuit Court of the Third
Circuit for further proceedings.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, May 31, 2018.
