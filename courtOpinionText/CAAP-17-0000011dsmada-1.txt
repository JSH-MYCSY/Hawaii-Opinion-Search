IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
MIKE YELLEN, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 3DTI-16-016502)

 
ORDER GRANTING APRIL 7, 2017 MOTION TO DISMISS
APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION

 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawaii's
 
(Appellee State) April 7, 2017 motion to dismiss Defendant-
Appellant Michael Yellen's (Appellant Yellen), pro se, appeal
 from the Honorable Margaret K. Masunaga's December 3, 2016
 judgment in district court case number 3DTI-16-016502 for the
 offense of noncompliance with the speed limit in violation of HRS
 § 291C-102 (2007), (2) the lack of any memorandum by Appellant
 Yellen in response to Appellee State's April 7, 2017 motion, and
 (3) the record, it appears that Appellant Yellen's appeal is
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
untimely under Rule 4(a)(1) of the Hawai 'i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP), and, thus, we lack appellate jurisdiction under 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (2016). 
An appellate court has an independent obligation to 
ensure jurisdiction over each case and to dismiss the appeal sua sponte if a jurisdictional defect exits. State v. Graybeard, 
93 Hawai
'i 513, 516, 6 P.3d 385, 388 (App. 2000). In its motion 
to dismiss, the State contends Yellen has no right to appeal the judgment on his speeding citation. We need not address this issue because regardless of Yellen's right to appeal, his notice of appeal was filed more than thirty days after the district court's December 3, 2016 judgment. 
The thirtieth calendar day after December 3, 2016, was
 
Monday, January 2, 2017, which was a holiday, and, thus, HRAP
 Rule 26(a) automatically extended the thirty-day time period
 under HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) until Tuesday, January 3, 2017. 
Appellant Yellen did not file his notice of appeal until 
January 9, 2017.
 
The failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a
 
civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot
 waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise
 of judicial discretion. Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727
 
P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or
 justice is authorized to change the jurisdictional requirements
 contained in Rule 4 of these rules."); HRAP Rule 26(e) ("The
 reviewing court for good cause shown may relieve a party from a
 default occasioned by any failure to comply with these rules,
 except the failure to give timely notice of appeal.").

Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellee State's
 
April 7, 2017 motion to dismiss appellate court case number 
CAAP-17-0000011 is granted for the reasons set forth herein, and
 appellate court case number CAAP-17-0000011 is dismissed for lack
 of appellate jurisdiction.
