APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 11-1-0052(2))
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record in CAAP-17-0000013, it
 
appears that this court lacks appellate jurisdiction over this
 
appeal. Defendant-Appellant Maria Daisy Sommers, Individually
 and as Trustee under that certain Unrecorded Trust Agreement
 Known as the Maria Daisy Sommers Revocable Trust Dated 
December 22, 2005 (Appellant), pro se, appeals from an
 unspecified final judgment in the case. 
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 667-51(a)(1) authorizes
 
an appeal from a judgment entered on a decree of foreclosure. An
 
appeal may also be taken from "[a] judgment entered on an order
 confirming the sale of the foreclosed property, if the circuit
 court expressly finds that no just reason for delay exists, and
 certifies the judgment as final pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the
 Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure." HRS § 667-51(a)(2). 
On July 31, 2013, the Circuit Court entered a Judgment
 
on the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting
 Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure
 Against All Defendants on Complaint Filed January 26, 2011, which
 was an appealable judgment pursuant to HRS § 667-51(a)(1).
 
On September 20, 2016, the Circuit Court entered a
 
Judgment on the Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion to Re-Open
 Bidding at Confirmation of Sale Hearing, Confirmation for Sale to
 Highest Bidder at Confirmation Hearing, Distribution of Proceeds,
 and for Writ of Ejectment Filed August 26, 2015, which was an
 appealable judgment pursuant to HRS § 667-51(a)(2).
 
Pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a) (1993), appeals are allowed
 
in civil matters from all final judgments, orders, or decrees of
 circuit and district courts. 
As an exception to the general rule requiring a final
 
judgment, order, or decree, the Forgay doctrine is based on the
 United States Supreme Court’s holding in Forgay v. Conrad, 47
 U.S. 201 (1848). The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has acknowledged the 
Forgay doctrine as "allow[ing] an appellant to immediately appeal a judgment for execution upon property, even if all claims of the parties have not been finally resolved." Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 
Hawai
'i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995). Under the Forgay 
doctrine, the Hawai 'i Supreme Court held that it had 
"jurisdiction to consider appeals from judgments which require immediate execution of a command that property be delivered to the appellant’s adversary, and the losing party would be subjected to irreparable injury if appellate review had to wait

the final outcome of the litigation." Id. (citations, internal
 
quotation marks and brackets omitted). 
A Writ of Ejectment was filed on September 20, 2016. 
Thus, the September 20, 2016 Writ of Ejectment was an appealable
 
order under Forgay. Id.
 
There are no other appealable final judgments or orders
 
in the record on appeal. 
Appellant filed a Notice of Appeal on January 12, 2017,
 
more than 30 days after entry of the July 31, 2013 Judgment, the
 September 20, 2016 Judgment, and the September 20, 2016 Writ of
 Ejectment. Therefore, the appeal was untimely as to each
 judgment and the writ of ejectment. HRAP Rule 4(a)(1). The
 failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a civil matter is a
 jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot waive and the
 appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise of judicial
 discretion. Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127,
 
1128 (1986). Accordingly, the court lacks appellate jurisdiction
 over the appeal. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is dismissed for
 
lack of appellate jurisdiction. All pending motions are denied
 as moot.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions for
 
appellate case number CAAP-17-0000013 are dismissed as moot.
