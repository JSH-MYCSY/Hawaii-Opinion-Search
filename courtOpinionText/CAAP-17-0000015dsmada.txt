STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Petitioner-Appellee, v.
JOZUA HFVAK, aka JON MAJOR, Respondent-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.
 NO. 16-1-0325)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPELLATE COURT CASE NUMBER
 
CAAP-17-0000015 FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION

 
AND
 
DISMISSING ALL PENDING MOTIONS IN CAAP-17-0000015 AS MOOT

 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Upon review of the record on appeal for appellate court

 
case number CAAP-17-0000015, it appears that we lack appellate
 
jurisdiction over Respondent-Appellant Jozua Hfvak aka Jon
 Major's (Appellant Hfvak) appeal from the Honorable Colette Y.
 Garibaldi's December 14, 2016 minute order and December 14, 2016
 order pertaining to bail, because the circuit court has not yet
 entered an order that finally determines, and, thus, ends, all
 proceedings on Appellant Hfvak's underlying petition for writ of
 habeas corpus. 
When Petitioner-Appellee State of Hawaii (Appellee
 
State) filed a complaint to extradite Appellant Hfvak to the
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
State of Washington in S.P. No. 16-1-0325 pursuant to Hawaii
 
Revised Statues (HRS) § 832-6 (2014), Appellant Hfvak apparently
 invoked his right to petition the circuit court for a writ of
 habeas corpus pursuant to HRS § 832-10 (2014), which provides:
 
§ 832-10. Rights of accused person; application for writ of
habeas corpus.
No person arrested upon the warrant shall be delivered
over to the agent whom the executive authority demanding him
has appointed to receive him unless he shall first be taken
before a judge of a court of record in this State, who shall
inform him of the demand made for his surrender and of the
 crime with which he is charged, and that he has the right to
demand and procure legal counsel; and if the prisoner or his
counsel states that he or they desire to test the legality
of his arrest, the judge of the court of record shall fix a
reasonable time to be allowed him within which to apply for
a writ of habeas corpus. When the writ is applied for,
notice thereof, and of the time and place of hearing
thereon, shall be given to the prosecuting officer of the
county in which the arrest is made and in which the accused
is in custody, and to the agent of the demanding state.
 
(Emphasis added). During the pendency of Appellant Hfvak's
 
petition for a writ of habeas corpus, the circuit court entered
 the December 14, 2016 minute order and December 14, 2016 order
 pertaining to bail, which Appellant Hfvak designated in his
 January 12, 2017 notice of appeal for appellate court case number
 CAAP-17-0000015.
 
A habeas corpus action is a civil case "to enforce the
 
civil right of personal liberty." Ex parte Mankichi, 13 Haw. 570
 
(Terr. 1901). Moreover, it has expressly been recognized, in the
 context of extradition proceedings, that a petition for a writ of
 habeas corpus is civil in nature. See Rodriquez v. Sandoval, 680
 
P.2d 1278 (Colorado 1984); In re Dean, 251 A.2d 347, 349
 (Delaware 1969)("Even when a petition is filed by a prisoner, the
 proceeding remains civil in nature; it does not change character
 by reason of the status of the petitioner."). We further note
 that, in Murray v. Burns, 48 Haw. 508, 405 P.2d 309 (1965), the
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawai'i Supreme Court exercised appellate jurisdiction in an 
appeal from an "order of the Circuit Court denying a petition for 
a writ of habeas corpus," in which the petitioners challenged extradition under Hawaii's Uniform Criminal Extradition Act. 
In civil circuit court proceedings, HRS § 641-1(a) 
(2016) authorizes appeals from a circuit court to the Hawai
'i 
Intermediate Court of Appeals from a "final judgments, orders, or decrees[.]" (Emphasis added). Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP) requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." Based on this requirement under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i holds that "[a]n appeal may be 
taken from circuit court orders resolving claims against parties only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte 
Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 
(1994). 
However, the Hawai 'i Rules of Civil Procedure "shall 
not apply" to "[h]abeas corpus proceedings under chapter 660[.]" HRCP Rule 81(a)(6). In our view, Appellant Hfvak's petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to HRS § 832-10 (2014) is similar to, and arguably is also in accordance with, a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under HRS § 660-5 (2016). Therefore, it appears that the separate document rule under HRCP Rule 58 and the holding in Jenkins does not apply to this case. As already stated, HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals to the Hawai
'i 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Intermediate Court of Appeals from a circuit court's final order, 
and the term "[f]inal order means an order ending the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be accomplished." Familian Northwest v. Central Pacific Boiler, 68 Haw. 368, 370, 714 P.2d 936, 937 (1986) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). 
In the instant case, the circuit court has not yet 
entered an appealable written order that expressly grants or denies Hfvak's petition for a writ of habeas corpus leaving nothing further to be accomplished. The December 14, 2016 order pertaining to bail did not expressly adjudicate Appellant Hfvak's petition, but, instead, it merely fixed bail at $125,000.00 and directed that if Appellant Hfvak was not extradited by January 17, 2017, then Appellant Hfvak would be required to appear for a proof of compliance hearing on January 17, 2017. Although the circuit court issued a December 14, 2016 minute order announcing the circuit court's intent to deny Appellant Hfvak's petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to HRS § 832-10 (2014), "a minute order is not an appealable order." Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai
'i 319, 321 
n.3, 966 P.2d 631, 633 n.3 (1998). The concept of entering of an order "signifies something more formal than mere oral rendition of an order or ruling of the court, and contemplates a filed written order." Scott v. Liu, 46 Haw. 221, 225-26 377 P.2d 696, 
700 (1963); State v. Bulgo, 45 Haw. 501, 503, 370 P.2d 480, 482 (1962). 
Absent an appealable final written order, signed by the
 
presiding judge, that finally determines all issues, and, thus,
 
-4­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
ends the petition for writ of habeas corpus proceeding, leaving
 
nothing further to be accomplished, we lack appellate
 jurisdiction over appellate court case number CAAP-17-0000015,
 and Appellant Hfvak's appeal is premature. When an appellate
 court lacks appellate jurisdiction, dismissal is the only
 appropriate remedy.
 
[J]urisdiction is the base requirement for any court
considering and resolving an appeal or original action.Appellate courts, upon determining that they lackjurisdiction shall not require anything other than adismissal of the appeal or action. Without jurisdiction, acourt is not in a position to consider the case further.Thus, appellate courts have an obligation to insure thatthey have jurisdiction to hear and determine each case. Thelack of subject matter jurisdiction can never be waived byany party at any time. Accordingly, when we perceive ajurisdictional defect in an appeal, we must, sua sponte,dismiss that appeal.

P.2d 576, 588 (1995) (citation, internal quotation marks, and
 ellipsis points omitted; emphasis added). Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number
 
CAAP-17-0000015 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions
 
in appellate court case number CAAP-17-0000015 are dismissed as
 moot.
