APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 16-1-0152)

 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
1
Upon review of the record,  it appears that we lack
jurisdiction over this appeal by Defendant/Counterclaim
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Graeme Donald Mankelow and Defendant-
Appellant Linda Mae Henriques (collectively, Appellants) because
 
1We also note that on June 23, 2017, this court issued an "Order
Granting in Part the June 7, 2017 Stipulation to Correct Omission from Record
on Appeal," which directs the First Circuit Court clerk to supplement the
record on appeal with a particular letter from counsel to the First Circuit
Court concerning deposition transcripts, or indicate why doing so is
impracticable.

the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit court)  has not
reduced its dispositive rulings on substantive claims to a 
separate, appealable, final judgment, as Hawaii Revised Statutes 
(HRS) § 641-1(a) (2016) and Rule 58 of the Hawai 'i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) require for an appeal from a civil, circuit-court case under the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming 
& Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
"Appeals shall be allowed in civil matters from all 
final judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit . . . courts[.]" 
HRS § 641-1(a) (Repl. 2016). Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be 
taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRCP 
Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a 
separate document." The Supreme Court of Hawai 'i has held that 
"[a]n appeal may be taken from circuit court orders resolving claims against parties only after the orders have been reduced to 
a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and 
against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" 
Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 
869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). "Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all 
claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a 
separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai
'i 245, 
254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008); Bailey v. DuVauchelle, 135 Hawai
'i 482, 489, 353 P.3d 1024, 1031 (2015). 
The Hawai 'i Supreme Court has held that a final 
judgment in a case involving multiple claims or parties "(a) must 
specifically identify the party or parties for and against whom 
the judgment is entered, and (b) must (i) identify the claims for 
which it is entered, and (ii) dismiss any claims not specifically 
identified[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. 
"[A]n appeal from any judgment will be dismissed as premature if the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all claims

against all parties or contain the finding necessary for 
certification under HRCP 54(b)." Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 
P.2d at 1338. 
This case involves multiple claims: Counts One, Two,
 
Three, and Four in the Complaint and the claim(s) concerning
 title, in the "Supplemental Complaint." The January 4, 2017 Rule
 
54(b) Final Judgment (Judgment) enters judgment in favor of
 
Plaintiff/Counterclaim Defendant-Appellee Gail Ann Kosiorek
 
(Kosiorek), pursuant to the court's January 4, 2017 "Order
 
Granting [Kosiorek's] Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on
 Supplemental Complaint and for Entry of Rule 54(b) Final
 
Judgment, (Filed on June 17, 2016)" (Order Granting MPSJ). The
 
Judgment enters judgment "on the title claims" in the
 
Supplemental Complaint in favor of Kosiorek, and explicitly
 
states that "[a]ll Parties and all Claims set forth in the
 
Complaint filed January 27, 2016 and in [Mankelow's] Counterclaim
 
filed March 28, 2016 are not affected by this Judgment and remain
 
for later adjudication." Thus, the Judgment does not resolve all
 
of the claims. 
"If the judgment resolves fewer than all claims against 
all parties or reserves any claim for later action by the court, 
an appeal may be taken only if the judgment contains the language 
necessary for certification, under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)" including 
"the necessary finding of no just reason for delay." Jenkins, 76 
Hawai
'i at 119-20, 869 P.2d 1338-39. Here, the Rule 54(b) Final 
Judgment does not include the necessary finding of "no just 
reason for delay" and, thus, does not include the language 
necessary for Rule 54(b) certification. Although the Order 
Granting MPSJ includes a finding of "no just reason for delay," 
the Hawai 'i Supreme Court has held that a non-final, circuit-
court order is not independently appealable, even if it includes HRCP Rule 54(b)-certification language, but "must be reduced to a 
judgment and the [HRCP Rule 54(b)] certification must be 
contained therein." Oppenheimer v. AIG Hawaii Ins. Co., 77

Hawai'i 88, 93, 881 P.2d 1234, 1239 (1994). Additionally, the 
Judgment does not state against whom the judgment is entered. 
Therefore, the Judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an 
appealable, final judgment under HRS § 641-1(a), HRCP Rules 58 
and 54(b), and the holding in Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 
P.2d at 1338. 
Although exceptions to the final judgment requirement
 
exist under the Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848), doctrine
 (the Forgay doctrine), the collateral-order doctrine, and HRS §
 
641–1(b), none of the exceptions applies. See Ciesla v.
 
Reddish, 78 Hawai‘i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) (regarding
 the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay
 
doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai‘i
 
319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding the three
 
requirements for appealability under the collateral order
 
doctrine); HRS § 641–1(b) (regarding the requirements for an
 
appeal from an interlocutory order). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appeal No. 
CAAP-17-0000019 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED:
 (1) the First Circuit Court clerk shall take no further
 
action on the June 23, 2017 "Order Granting in Part the June 7,
 2017 Stipulation to Correct Omission from Record on Appeal"; and
 
(2) the appellate clerk shall serve a copy of this
 
order on the First Circuit Court clerk.
