APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
(CASE NO. 5RC-16-1-0424)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
Upon review of the record in this appeal and the
Hawai#i State Judiciary's Ho# ohiki database for the underlying
case in Civil No. 5RC 16-1-0424, it appears that Defendant-
Appellant Michele C. Rundgren (Rundgren) appeals from the
Honorable Joseph Kobayashi's December 21, 2016 order granting
Plaintiff-Appellee Stonecrest Acquisitions, LLC's (Stonecrest
Acquisitions) motion for summary judgment, but we lack appellate
jurisdiction because the December 21, 2016 order is not an NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
appealable final order that ended the proceedings in the
underlying case.
Pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a)
(2016),
appeals are allowed in civil matters from all final
judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit and district
courts.  In district court cases, a judgment includes any
order from which an appeal lies.  See District Court Rules
of Civil Procedure (DCRCP) Rule 54(a) (1996).  A final order
means an order ending the proceeding, leaving nothing
further to be accomplished
. . . .  When a written judgment,
order, or decree ends the litigation by fully deciding all
rights and liabilities of all parties, leaving nothing
further to be adjudicated, the judgment, order, or decree is
final and appealable.
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai# i 425, 426, 984 P.2d 1251,
1252 (1999) (citations, internal quotation marks, and footnote
omitted; emphases added).  The Supreme Court of Hawai# i
has promulgated separate rules governing civil procedure in
the district courts . . . .  DCRCP Rule 58 (1996), in
contrast to HRCP Rule 58, does not by its plain language
require that judgment be set forth on a "separate document." 
Thus, the requirements set forth in Jenkins [v. Cades
Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawaii 115, 869 P.2d 1334
(1994)], are not applicable to district court cases. 
Consequently, an order that fully disposes of an action in
the district court may be final and appealable without the
entry of judgment on a separate document, as long as the
appealed order ends the litigation by fully deciding the
rights and liabilities of all parties and leaves nothing
further to be adjudicated.
Id. at 427, 984 P.2d at 1253 (footnote and citation omitted). 
When Rundgren filed her January 20, 2017 notice of
appeal, the district court already resolved most, but not all, of
the substantive issues in the underlying case by way of
• a December 7, 2016 judgment for possession,1 and
• the December 21, 2016 summary judgment order.
The only remaining substantive issue was whether Stonecrest
Acquisitions was entitled to an award of money damages as a
result of Rundgren's liability for trespass, which the district 
1Although an aggrieved party is entitled to an "immediate
appeal of the judgment for possession under the Forgay
doctrine[,]" the aggrieved party is also entitled to "await final
resolution of all claims in the case before challenging the
judgment for possession."  Ciesla v. Reddish , 78 Hawai #i 18, 21,
889 P.2d 702, 705 (1995).

court retained for subsequent determination.  The December 21,
2016 partial summary judgment order adjudicated the issue of
liability as to trespass without resolving whether Stonecrest
Acquisitions was entitled to a corresponding award of money
damages, and the district court retained the case for further
action on that issue.  Therefore, the December 21, 2016 summary
judgment order does not qualify as an appealable final order
under HRS § 641-1(a) and Casumpang , and Rundgren's January 20,
2017 notice of appeal is premature.
Rule 4(a)(2) of the Hawai #i Rules of Appellate
Procedure (HRAP) authorizes a premature notice of appeal, but
only "[i]f a notice of appeal is filed after announcement of a
decision but before entry of the judgment or order[.]" (Emphasis
added). 
Here, Rundgren filed her January 20, 2017 notice of
appeal before the district court announced its final decision on
money damages.  The Judiciary's Ho #ohiki database indicates that
Stonecrest Acquisitions filed a motion for summary judgment on
the issue of money damages for trespass five months later , on May
24, 2017, resulting in the district court's final order granting
the motion on July 18, 2017.  Rundgren's January 20, 2017 notice
of appeal could not apply to the July 18, 2017 final order on
money damages under HRAP Rule 4(a)(2).  Grattafiori v. State , 79
Hawai#i 10, 14, 897 P.2d 937, 941 (1995). 
Based on the above, we lack appellate jurisdiction in
this appeal.
