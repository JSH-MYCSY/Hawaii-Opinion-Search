APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
(CASE NO. 5RC-16-1-0424)
ORDER DENYING HRAP RULE 40 MOTION
FOR RECONSIDERATION OF FEBRUARY 15, 2018
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
Upon review of (1) the February 15, 2018 order
dismissing appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction,
(2) Defendant-Appellant Michele C. Rundgren's (Rundgren)
February 26, 2018 motion for reconsideration of the February 15,
2018 order of dismissal pursuant to Rule 40 of the Hawai #i Rules
of Appellate Procedure (HRAP), and (3) the record, it appears
that we did not overlook or misapprehend any points of law or
fact when we entered the February 15, 2018 order of dismissal.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
We note, in particular, that the December 7, 2016
judgment for possession and the December 21, 2016 summary
judgment order directly address the merits of Plaintiff-Appellee
Stonecrest Acquisitions, LLC's (Stonecrest Acquisitions)
complaint for (1) ejectment and (2) trespass, and, thus, they do
not qualify for appeal under the collateral order doctrine.  See
Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai# i 319, 322,
966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (limiting the collateral order doctrine
to orders that resolve an important issue completely separate
from the merits of the action).
Moreover, although the December 7, 2016 judgment for
possession (with an accompanying December 7, 2016 writ of
possession) was immediately appealable under the Forgay doctrine,
Rundgren's January 20, 2017 notice of appeal was not timely as to
the December 7, 2016 judgment for possession under HRAP Rule
4(a).  "The immediate appeal of the judgment for possession under
the Forgay doctrine being untimely, [the aggrieved party] must
await final resolution of all claims in the case before
challenging the judgment for possession."  Ciesla v. Reddish , 78
Hawai#i 18, 21, 889 P.2d 702, 705 (1995).  As explained in the
February 15, 2018 order of dismissal, the December 21, 2016
summary judgment order does not qualify as an appealable final
order under HRS ยง 641-1(a) (2016) and Casumpang v. ILWU, Local
142, 91 Hawai# i 425, 426-27, 984 P.2d 1251, 1252-53 (1999),
because the December 21, 2016 summary judgment order adjudicated
the issue of liability as to trespass without resolving the
outstanding issue whether Stonecrest Acquisitions was entitled to
a corresponding award of money damages, which the district court
retained for further action in the future.
When we perceive a jurisdictional defect on appeal, we
must sua sponte dismiss the appeal.  Ciesla, 78 Hawai #i at 20,
889 P.2d at 704.
