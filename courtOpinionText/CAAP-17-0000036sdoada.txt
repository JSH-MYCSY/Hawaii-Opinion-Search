STATE OF HAWAI #I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
CARDELL CHARLES, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
WAI#ANAE DIVISION
(1DTA-14-05659)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Cardell Charles (Charles) appeals
from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and
Plea/Judgment, entered on December 2, 2016 in the District Court
of the First Circuit, Wai #anae Division (District Court).1
Charles was convicted of Operating a Vehicle Under the
Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii
Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 291E-61(a)(1) (Supp. 2016).2
On appeal, Charles contends there was insufficient
evidence to convict him of OVUII.
1The Honorable James C. McWhinnie presided.
2HRS ยง 291E-61(a) states:
ยง291E-61  Operating a vehicle under the influence of
an intoxicant. (a) A person commits the offense of operating
a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if the person
operates or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle:
(1) While under the influence of alcohol in an
amount sufficient to impair the person's normal
mental faculties or ability to care for the
person and guard against casualty[.]NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve Charles's point of error as follows and affirm:
When the evidence is considered in the strongest light
for the prosecution, State v. Matavale, 115 Hawai# i 149, 157-58,
166 P.3d 322, 330-31 (2007), there was substantial evidence to
support Charles's conviction.  Prior to being stopped on
Farrington Highway by Corporal John Dorsey (Corporal Dorsey),
Charles was observed drifting to the left and driving on a broken
white line with his left two tires for approximately 100 feet. 
Corporal Dorsey was traveling to the left and slightly behind
Charles's vehicle, and Corporal Dorsey backed off because he was
afraid that Charles's vehicle might collide with him.  Corporal
Dorsey testified that Charles "got within a couple feet of me[.]" 
After stopping Charles's vehicle, Corporal Dorsey observed that
Charles had red and glassy eyes, a strong odor of an alcoholic
beverage, and Charles slurred his speech.  Charles initially
stated that he had not been drinking but then stated that "he had
been drinking a long time ago but he hadn't in a while." 
Although Charles stated that he understood the instructions for
the walk-and-turn test, Charles twice stepped with his heel at
least five inches apart from his toe while walking nine steps
down and then at least five inches apart twice again while
walking back, which was not in accordance with the instructions. 
During the turn on the walk-and-turn test, Charles performed it
backwards from what Corporal Dorsey told him to do and
repositioned his right foot in front of his left foot and then
proceeded to walk back.  During the one-leg stand test Charles
started losing his balance, raised his arms, and started hopping
and swaying, all of which were signs that Charles did not perform
the test as instructed.  The credible evidence was of sufficient
quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable
caution to support the conclusion that Charles was guilty of
OVUII from all reasonable and rational inferences under the facts

in evidence, including circumstantial evidence.  State v. Batson ,
73 Haw. 236, 248-49, 831 P.2d 924, 931 (1992).
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of
Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, entered on
December 2, 2016 in the District Court of the First Circuit,
Wai#anae Division is affirmed.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, December 12, 2017.
