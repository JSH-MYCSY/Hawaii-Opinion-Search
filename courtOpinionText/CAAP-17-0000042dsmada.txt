APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 15-1-0482)

 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Upon review of the record in CAAP-17-0000042, it
 
appears that this court lacks appellate jurisdiction over the
 
appeal. Plaintiff-Appellant Thomas Schmidt (Appellant) appeals
 pro se from the "Order Granting Defendants Gary Victor Dubin and
 Dubin Law Offices' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment #1 On All
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Claims Based on an Alleged Debt, Filed On September 23, 2016"
 
(Order), filed on December 27, 2016, in the Circuit Court of the
 First Circuit.
 The Order granted summary judgment on Appellant's
 
claims for recovery of an alleged debt and/or which are premised
 upon an alleged debt, and as to legal malpractice, in favor of
 Defendants-Third Party Plaintiffs-Appellees Gary Victor Dubin and
 Dubin Law Offices (Dubin).
 
HRS ยง 641-1(a) (Repl. 2016) authorizes appeals from 
final judgments, orders, or decrees from the Circuit Court. Appeals under HRS ยง 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS ยง 641-1(c). Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) requires that "[e]very 
judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." The Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has held that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . 
only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte 
Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 
(1994). "Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai
'i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 
1186 (2008). "An appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Jenkins, 76 
Hawai
'i at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote omitted). 
All of the claims have not been resolved or dismissed. 
Specifically, Dubin's third-party claim against Third-Party
 Defendant-Appellee John S. Carroll was not adjudicated or
 dismissed. In addition, no separate judgment on the Order was
 entered, as required by Jenkins. Therefore, the appeal is
 premature and this court lacks appellate jurisdiction.
