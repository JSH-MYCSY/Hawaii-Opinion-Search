APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 16-1-1638)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the records in CAAP-17-0000043, it
 
appears that this court lacks appellate jurisdiction over the
 
appeal. Plaintiff-Appellant Mary Ann McAndrew, Individually and
 as Trustee of the Mary Ann McAndrew Revocable Living Trust Dated
 March 11, 2005 (Appellant), appeals from the "Order Granting
 Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative, For Summary
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Judgment on Plaintiff's Complaint for Trial De Novo Filed 
August 26, 2016, Filed October 3, 2016" (Order), filed on December 28, 2016, in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit.
 The Order granted summary judgment on Appellant's
 
August 26, 2016 Complaint for Trial De Novo in favor Defendants-
Appellees Association of Apartment Owners of Kuapa Isle, an
 Unincorporated Condominium Association, by its Board of
 Directors; Gerry Bogert, Garry Brechin, Jim Dittman, Mark Elwell,
 Howard Tocman, and Fred Wong (Appellees) and against Appellant. 
HRS § 641-1(a) (Repl. 2016) authorizes appeals from 
final judgments, orders, or decrees from the Circuit Court. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." 
HRS § 641-1(c). Rule 58 of the 
Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) requires that "[e]very 
judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." The Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has held that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . 
only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte 
Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 
(1994). "Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai
'i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 
1186 (2008). 
No separate judgment on the Order is in the record on
 
appeal. Therefore, the appeal is premature and this court lacks
 appellate jurisdiction over the appeal.

Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is
 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
