IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
MICHAEL RAY HUGHES, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Respondent-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(S.P.P. NO. 16-1-0001(1); CR. NO. 89-0225(1)) 
MEMORANDUM OPINION 
(By: Ginoza, C.J., Leonard and Wadsworth, JJ.)
 The Circuit Court of the Second Circuit1/ (Circuit 
Court) denied the Hawai# i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40 
petition filed on March 3, 2016, by self-represented 
Petitioner-Appellant Michael Ray Hughes (Hughes). 
Hughes appeals 
from the "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Dismissing HRPP Rule 40 Petition" (Order), entered on January 9, 
2017. 
On appeal, Hughes contends that the Circuit Court erred 
in denying his HRPP Rule 40 petition, because it contained 
allegations that if proven would have entitled Hughes to relief. 
For the reasons explained below, we affirm. 
I. Background 
The following findings of fact by the Circuit Court are 
unchallenged on appeal and are thus binding on the parties and this court, see State v. Rodrigues, 145 Hawai# i 487, 494, 454 
P.3d 428, 435 (2019): 
1/ The Honorable Rhonda I.L. Loo presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
I. FINDINGS OF FACT 
. . . . 
2. On July 5, 1989, in CR 89-0225(1), the State
charged [Hughes] via Complaint with Attempted Murder in the
First Degree (Count One); Terroristic Threatening in theFirst Degree (Count Two); Felon in Possession of a Firearm(Count Three); Felon in Possession of Firearm Ammunition(Count 4); and Place to Keep Firearm (Count 5). 
3. On August 17, 1989, [Hughes]'s attorney filed a
Motion to Extend Time to File Pre-Trial Motion and/orContinuing Trial. 
After holding a hearing, the Circuit
Court issued an order granting the motion. 
4. On February 20, 1990, the jury trial commenced
before the Honorable John E. McConnell. Following the closeof evidence, both sides presented their closing arguments onMarch 1, 1990. On the same day, the jury found [Hughes]guilty as charged on all counts. 
5. On June 22, 1990, the trial court sentenced
[Hughes] to life imprisonment without the possibility ofparole in Count One, Five years imprisonment on Counts Twoand Five, and Ten years imprisonment on Counts Three andFour. 
6. On July 17, 1990, [Hughes] filed a Notice of
Appeal. On November 26, 1990, [Hughes] filed his OpeningBrief in the Supreme Court of the State of Hawaii under S.C.No. 14689. On February 4, 1991 the State filed itsAnswering Brief. On February 14, 1991, [Hughes] filed hisReply Brief. On May 28, 1991, the Hawaii Supreme Courtissued its opinion affirming the convictions. 
(Record citations omitted.) 
The Hawai# i Supreme Court's above-referenced opinion in 
State v. Hughes, No. 14689 (Haw. May 28, 1991) (mem.), stated: 
MEMORANDUM OPINION 
Defendant-appellant Michael Ray Hughes appeals from
his convictions of Attempted Murder in the First Degree, inviolation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707-701 (count1); Terroristic Threatening in the First Degree, inviolation of HRS § 707-716 (count 2); Felon in Possession ofa Firearm, in violation of HRS § 134-7 (count 3); Felon inPossession of a Firearm Ammunition, in violation of HRS§ 134-7 (count 4); and Place to Keep Firearm, in violationof HRS § 134-6 (count 5). 
Defendant-appellant contends: 
1) that the trial court
committed reversible error in its instructions to the juryregarding the elements of counts 3, 4, and 5; and 2) that hehad ineffective assistance of counsel. 
We find that, although the instructions for counts 3,
4, and 5 did not include the requisite mental states for thecharged offenses, this error was harmless and did not
contribute to the convictions. State v. Domingo, 69 Haw.
68, 733 P.2d 690 (1987). 
2  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel, we
find that defendant-appellant failed to show the withdrawal
of a meritorious defense. Even assuming that his counselrendered ineffective assistance, defendant-appellant's claimwill only be upheld if he can show that counsel's errorsresulted in either the withdrawal or substantial impairmentof a potentially meritorious defense. State v. Smith, 68
Haw. 304, 309, 712 P.2d 496, 500 (1986). 
Accordingly, the convictions of defendant-appellant
are affirmed. 
The Circuit Court's unchallenged findings of fact 
continue as follows: 
7. On April 26, 2006, [Hughes] filed his first
Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment, orRelease Petitioner from Custody ("Petition No. 1"), in theCircuit Court of the Second Circuit. 
8. On October 31, 2006, the Circuit Court filed its
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order DenyingHughes' Petition No. 1. [Hughes] filed a notice of appealon November 30, 2006. On July 31, 2008, the HawaiiIntermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) issued their SummaryDisposition affirming the Circuit Court's denial of PetitionNo. 1. On December 22, 2008, the Hawaii Supreme Courtrejected [Hughes]'s application for writ of certiorari. 
This court's above-referenced summary disposition in 
Hughes v. State, No. 28298, 2009 WL 2932762 (Haw. App. July 31, 
2008) (SDO), stated in part: 
COL 5 
Ground one of Hughes's [Petition No. 1] claims ineffectiveassistance of trial counsel. Hughes previously raised theissue of ineffective assistance of trial counsel on direct appeal, and it was ruled on by the Hawai #i Supreme Court.
The circuit court did not err in concluding that the issueof ineffective assistance of trial counsel had been either ruled upon in a previous appeal or waived. 
HRPP Rule 
40(a)(3). 
. . . . 
COL 15 Hughes claimed his appellate counsel was ineffective becausecounsel did not raise every possible error that might showineffective assistance of trial counsel. The circuit court noted that in [Petition No. 1], Hughes pointed to sixteenways his trial counsel was ineffective. The circuit courtconcluded that many of Hughes's claims of ineffectiveassistance of trial counsel were raised in his direct appeal. 
. . . . 
The circuit court did not err in concluding that an informedand diligent criminal attorney would not have included onappeal the additional points Hughes claimed should have beenraised.

Id. at *2-3 (citation omitted). 
The Circuit Court's unchallenged findings of fact
continue as follows :  
9. On March 3, 2016, [Hughes] filed his present Rule
40 Petition [( Petition No. 2 )] on the following grounds for
why relief should be granted: 
Claim []1: [Hughes] alleges his state and federal
constitutional rights were violated because he wasprosecuted without the presentment or indictment of agrand jury. 
Claim []2: [Hughes] alleges the prosecution illegally
amended the complaint in violation of HRPP Rule 7 andhis constitutional rights. 
Claim []3
: [Hughes] alleges that the District Court
lacked proper jurisdiction over the complaint which
contained the felony offenses. 
Claim []4: [Hughes] alleges that he was "illegally
charged and prosecuted for the felony offense ofTerroristic Threatening in the First Degree." 
Claim []5: [Hughes] alleges that his state and federal
constitutional right to a speedy trial and HRPP Rule48 were violated. 
Claim []6: [Hughes] alleges that the Hawaii Paroling
Authority had no authority to set his minimum termsand that "multiple statutory term sentences (which aremandatory) occurring from multiple offenses which werebased on single use of firearm from a single incident-were illegal, multiplicious, and prejudicial." 
Claim []7: [Hughes] alleges his state and federalconstitutional rights were violated because thefirearm charges are an included offense of [Hughes]'sattempted murder charge. 
Claim []8: [Hughes] alleges the Hawaii Rules of
Evidence [( HRE)], Rule 404(b) was violated when the
State presented evidence before the jury that [Hughes]was previously convicted of Assault in the SecondDegree. 
Claim []9: [Hughes] alleges the amount of errors in
this matter amount to cumulative error and the sheer volume of errors was prejudicial and mandates reversalof [Hughes]'s convictions. 
Claim []10: [Hughes] seeks reservation of any
additional claims that may later arise from review ofcourt transcripts or documents from the court record. 
10. None of the claims listed in the above paragraph
were raised in Petition No. 1. 
On January 9, 2017, the Circuit Court entered the Order 
denying Petition No. 2 without a hearing. The Circuit Court 
determined that all of Hughes's claims, except for Claim 9, 
4  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
alleging cumulative error, were waived "pursuant to HRPP Rule 
40(a)(3) since [Hughes] had a reasonable opportunity to raise [these] issue[s] on direct appeal and/or in Petition No. 1." Additionally, the court determined as to each claim that "[e]ven when taken as true, [the facts alleged in Petition No. 2] do not entitle [Hughes] to relief under HRPP Rule 40." 
On January 31, 2017, Hughes timely filed a notice of 
appeal. 
II. Standards of Review 
HRPP Rule 40(a)(3) provides, in relevant part: 
Rule 40 proceedings shall not be available and relief
thereunder shall not be granted where the issues sought tobe raised have been previously ruled upon or were waived.Except for a claim of illegal sentence, an issue is waivedif the petitioner knowingly and understandingly failed toraise it and it could have been raised before the trial, atthe trial, on appeal, in a habeas corpus proceeding or anyother proceeding actually conducted, or in a priorproceeding actually initiated under this rule, and thepetitioner is unable to prove the existence of extraordinarycircumstances to justify the petitioner's failure to raisethe issue. There is a rebuttable presumption that a failureto appeal a ruling or to raise an issue is a knowing andunderstanding failure. 
HRPP Rule 40(f) provides, in relevant part: 
[T]he court may deny a hearing if the petitioner's claim ispatently frivolous and is without trace of support either inthe record or from other evidence submitted by thepetitioner. 
A trial court's denial of an HRPP Rule 40 petition is 
reviewed de novo. Dan v. State, 76 Hawai# i 423, 427, 879 P.2d 
528, 532 (1994). 
As a general rule, a hearing should be held on a Rule 40petition for post-conviction relief where the petitionstates a colorable claim. To establish a colorable claim,the allegations of the petition must show that if taken astrue the facts alleged would change the verdict, however, apetitioner's conclusions need not be regarded as true. Whereexamination of the record of the trial court proceedingsindicates that the petitioner's allegations show nocolorable claim, it is not error to deny the petition
without a hearing. The question on appeal of a denial of a
Rule 40 petition without a hearing is whether the trial
record indicates that Petitioner's application for reliefmade such a showing of a colorable claim as to require ahearing before the lower court.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
792-93 (1987)). 
III. Discussion 
Hughes contends that the Circuit Court erred: (1) in 
failing to file documents and motions submitted by Hughes, 
including various document requests and a motion to amend Petition No. 2; (2) in not providing Hughes with requested documents and transcripts without charge; (3) in determining that all but one of Hughes's claims were waived pursuant to HRRP Rule 40(a)(3); (4) in dismissing Claim 1, alleging that Hughes's state and federal constitutional rights were violated because he was prosecuted without the presentment or indictment of a grand jury; (5) in dismissing Claim 2, alleging that the complaint against Hughes in his underlying criminal case was illegally amended by the prosecution; (6) in dismissing Claim 3, alleging that the District Court of the Second Circuit (District Court) lacked 
jurisdiction over the complaint, which contained felony offenses; 
(7) in dismissing Claim 4, as Hughes "was charged and convicted for both terroristic threatening and firearm charge (HRS § 134-6)[,] whereby one charge is included within the other"; (8) in dismissing Claim 5, alleging that Hughes's constitutional right to a speedy trial and HRPP Rule 48 were violated; (9) in dismissing Claim 6, alleging that "multiple . . . minimum term sentences" that were determined by a "non-trier of fact" were illegal; (10) in dismissing Claim 7, alleging that Hughes's state and federal constitutional rights were violated because the "firearm charges are an included offense of [the] attempted murder charge"; (11) in dismissing Claim 8, alleging that "[HRE] Rule 404(b) was violated when the State admitted evidence before the jury that [Hughes] was previously convicted of Assault in the Second Degree"; and (12) dismissing Claim 9, alleging that cumulative errors require reversal of Hughes's convictions.
2/ 
Hughes also asserts "reserved" claims 10A (rule of lenity) and 10B (ineffective assistance of counsel). 
2/ Hughes's points of error have been reordered, restated and
condensed for clarity. 
6  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
We group these contentions by subject matter and 
address each of them below. 
A. Document and Filing Issues 
Hughes contends that the Circuit Court violated HRPP 
Rules 42, 49, and 52 by "failing to file multiple documents, 
requests[,] and motions submitted by [Hughes] pertaining to and supporting the instant Petition," thereby denying Hughes "constitutionally protected access to the courts." Hughes lists sixteen documents that the Circuit Court allegedly "failed to file and/or enter into the record[.]" 
This argument lacks merit for two reasons. First, 
Hughes has not identified "where in the record the alleged error [in failing to file documents] was objected to or the manner in which the alleged error was brought to the attention of the [Circuit C]ourt . . . ." HRAP Rule 28(b)(4)(iii); see id. Rule 10(e)(1) ("If any differences arise as to whether the record truly discloses what occurred in the court or agency appealed from, the differences shall be submitted to and settled by that court or agency and the record made to conform to the truth."). This basis for appeal was therefore waived. See State v. 
Gonzalez, 128 Hawai# i 314, 317, 288 P.3d 788, 791 (2012) (noting 
that "the failure to properly raise an issue at the trial level precludes a party from raising that issue on appeal" (quoting State v. Kikuta, 125 Hawai# i 78, 89, 253 P.3d 639, 650 (2011))); 
HRAP Rule 28(b)(4) (Points not presented in accordance with this section will be disregarded . . . ."). 
Second, even if we were to consider the asserted error, 
it appears that the sixteen listed documents are not part of the record, and Hughes has failed to demonstrate how the alleged failure to file any of the documents affected his substantial rights. See HRPP Rule 52(a). Nor can we determine the effect of 
the alleged error as Hughes has not provided a sufficient record for us to do so. See HRAP Rule 11(a) ("It is the responsibility 
of [the] appellant to provide a record . . . that is sufficient to review the points asserted . . . ."); Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai# i 225, 230, 909 P.2d 553, 558 (1995) ("The 
7  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
law is clear in this jurisdiction that the appellant has the 
burden of furnishing the appellate court with a sufficient record to positively show the alleged error." (quoting Union Bldg. Materials Corp. v. The Kakaako Corp., 5 Haw. App. 146, 151, 682 P.2d 82, 87 (1984))). 
Relatedly, Hughes contends that the Circuit Court erred 
in failing to file Hughes's motion for leave to amend Petition No. 2, and in not allowing amendment of Petition No. 2. But the purported motion, which Hughes states was not ruled upon, is not 
part of the record, and Hughes has not provided a sufficient 
record for us to evaluate his contention. We thus reject the asserted error. See Tradewinds Hotel, Inc. v. Cochran, 8 Haw. 
App. 256, 266, 799 P.2d 60, 66-67 (1990). 
Hughes also contends that it was an abuse of discretion 
for the Circuit Court to "fail to provide pro se indigent [Hughes's] requested documents and transcripts" supporting Hughes's points of error on appeal "when those same documents and transcripts are availab[l]e to others who[] c[an] afford them." 
Initially, it is not clear from the record exactly what 
documents and transcripts Hughes requested from the Circuit Court and when such requests were made. Hughes claims that he submitted "Ex Parte Motion[s] for Production of Documents[,]" dated November 24, 2015, and April 4, 2016, to the Circuit Court, and that these motions were not filed. These motions are not part of the record,
3/ and Hughes has failed to demonstrate how the 
Circuit Court's alleged failure to provide requested transcripts and documents affected his substantial rights. See HRPP Rule 
52(a). Both the United States Supreme Court and the Hawai# i 
Supreme Court have held that a petitioner does not have a statutory or constitutional right to free transcripts to aid the petitioner in preparing a petition for collateral relief. See 
United States v. MacCollom, 426 U.S. 317, 323–28 (1976); Santiago v. Chan, No. 28885, 2007 WL 4396055, at *1 (Haw. Dec. 10, 2007) 
3/ Hughes improperly attached copies of several documents to his
reply brief, including an unfiled document entitled "Petitioner's Second Ex
Parte Motion for Production of Documents," dated April 4, 2016, which does notidentify any specific requested documents. See HRAP Rule 28(d). The 
documents attached to the reply brief are not part of the record on appeal.See HRAP Rules 10(e), 11(a). 
8  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(citing HRS § 802–7 (1993) and MacCollum, 426 U.S. at 323-28). 
Accordingly, Hughes has failed to demonstrate any error by the Circuit Court related to his purported request for transcripts and documents free of charge. 
We also note that on April 10, 2017, Hughes filed a 
document in this appeal titled, "Appellant's Request for Preparation of Transcripts and Production of Documents (Fourth Request)" (April 10, 2017 Motion), by which Hughes requested the 
preparation of four transcripts and the production of thirteen 
documents from his related criminal case, Cr. No. 89-0225. Based on the appendices attached to the April 10, 2017 Motion, it appears that Hughes claims to have previously requested these same transcripts and documents from the Circuit Court. In the April 10, 2017 Motion, Hughes also requested that this court waive copy and production costs because the Circuit Court granted him leave to proceed in forma pauperis in the underlying case. 
This court granted in part and denied in part the 
April 10, 2017 Motion by order entered on June 21, 2017, and granted in part and denied in part Hughes's July 7, 2017 motion for reconsideration by order entered on July 27, 2017. In summary, this court determined that "[w]ith respect to the documents requested in the [April 10, 2017] Motion, all but the June 16, 1989 complaint in district court, and all of the minutes from the criminal case are included in the record on appeal[.]" (Footnote omitted.) Regarding Hughes's request for the four transcripts: (1) this court determined that the June 20, 1989 transcript was already part of the record on appeal; (2) upon 
temporary remand, the Circuit Court clerk determined that no 
transcripts could be filed for the dates of July 12, 1989, and September 27, 1989, because no hearings occurred on those dates; and 3) pursuant to this Court's July 27, 2017 order, the June 22, 1990 transcript was filed in this appeal on August 23, 2017. This court's June 21, 2017 order made clear that Hughes "may request copies of all documents and transcripts that are included in the record on appeal by submitting a written request to the appellate clerk, who will notify [Hughes] of the associated costs 
9  
  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
for copying and postage."4/ 
On this record, Hughes has not shown how the Circuit 
Court's alleged failure to provide any requested transcripts or 
documents affected his substantial rights. Accordingly, his point of error is without merit. 
B. Waiver of Claims 
Hughes contends that the Circuit Court erred in 
determining that all of his claims, other than Claim 9, alleging 
cumulative error, were waived pursuant to HRPP Rule 40(a)(3). Hughes argues that he submitted claims of illegal sentence, which pursuant to HRPP Rule 40(a)(3) are an exception to waiver; he raised a jurisdictional issue, which cannot be deemed waived; and he "cannot be held to answer for the failings and om[]issions of" his prior counsel. 
Hughes is correct that Claim 6, as a claim of illegal 
sentence,
5/ was exempt from being waived under HRPP Rule 40(a)(3). 
See Stanley, 148 Hawai# i at 502, 479 P.3d at 120; Flubacher, 142 
Hawai#i at 114 n.7, 414 P.3d at 166 n.7 ("[A]ny analysis of 
waiver must be made in light of HRPP Rule 40(a)(3), which specifically exempts illegal sentence claims from being waived."). Hughes is also correct that Claim 3 raises a jurisdictional issue that was not waived. See Adams v. State, 
103 
Hawai#i 214, 220–21, 81 P.3d 394, 400–01 (2003) ("questions 
regarding subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any stage of a cause of action" (brackets omitted) (quoting Amantiad v. Odum, 90 Hawai# i 152, 159, 977 P.2d 160, 167 (1999))). Thus, the 
Circuit Court erred in ruling that Claims 3 and 6 were waived. Nonetheless, we conclude that the Circuit Court was correct in 
4/ This court's January 8, 2018 order also informed Hughes that,
"[a]s a party to the appeal, [Hughes] may become a [Judiciary Electronic
Filing System] user and access the record on appeal electronically withoutcharge via the internet at www.courts.state.hi.us." 
5/ "A sentence is illegal if the sentencing court lacks authority to
impose it, or it is imposed in violation of the law." Thomas v. State,
CAAP-19-0000630, 2021 WL 1699887, at *1 n.2 (Haw. App. Apr. 29, 2021) (SDO)(citing Stanley v. State, 148 Hawai #i 489, 502, 479 P.3d 107, 120 (2021);
Flubacher v. State, 142 Hawai #i 109, 110-11, 414 P.3d 161, 162-63 (2018);
Moananu v. State, CAAP-18-0000447, 2020 WL 3034708, *6 (Haw. App. June 5,2020) (mem.)). 
10  
  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
ruling that Claims 3 and 6 failed to state colorable claims, as 
discussed below in sections C and D. 
Hughes also argues that he "cannot be held to answer 
for the failings and om[]issions of the counsel(s) appointed by the State of Hawaii whom previously represented [Hughes] (nor any other prior counsel)." Hughes did not present an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in Petition No. 2. While Hughes attempts to raise an ineffective assistance claim for the first time on appeal in the form of his "reserved claim" 10(B), we do not consider this claim for the reasons discussed below in section F.
6/ 
Even if we were to consider Hughes's argument regarding 
his prior counsel, Hughes asserts only generally that his counsel "either [did] not know[] the law, f[ound] the task too labor[i]ous, or flat out den[ied] the wishes of their client." Such general arguments do not establish extraordinary circumstances preventing waiver. See HRAP Rule 40(a)(3); Dan, 76 
Hawai#i at 427, 879 P.2d at 532 ("General claims of 
ineffectiveness are insufficient and every action or omission is not subject to inquiry." (quoting Briones v. State, 74 Haw. 442, 462–63, 848 P.2d 966, 976 (1993))). Hughes has not asserted specific errors or omissions that resulted in the withdrawal or substantial impairment of a meritorious defense. See Dan, 76 
Hawai#i at 427, 879 P.2d at 532. 
Thus, Hughes has not established the existence of 
extraordinary circumstances to justify his prior failure to raise issues that he now raises in Petition No. 2, which could have been raised in his direct appeal or Petition No. 1. Accordingly, the Circuit Court did not err in ruling that Claims 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 10 were waived.
7/ 
6/ We also note that Hughes previously raised the issue of
ineffective assistance of trial counsel on direct appeal, which was ruled on
by the supreme court, and in Petition No. 1, which was ruled on by this court.See Hughes, 2008 WL 2932762, at *2. Hughes also raised the issue ofineffective assistance of appellate counsel in Petition No. 1, which was ruledon by this court. Id. at *3. 
7/ With respect to Claim 4, Hughes argues in part that Hawai #i law 
"prohibits separate sentences for both an offense and an offense includedtherein." 
However, Claim 4 was not presented as a claim of illegal sentence
in Petition No. 2. Similarly, Claim 7, which asserted that "[Hughes's] 
11  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
C. Jurisdictional Issue 
Hughes contends that the Circuit Court erred in 
dismissing Claim 3. Hughes argues that the District Court, which 
held a preliminary hearing in Hughes's underlying criminal case, lacked "jurisdiction [over] a felony offense - and thereby, the ability to allow an amendment (by jurisdiction) of a charged felony offense." 
In dismissing Claim 3, the Circuit Court stated, in 
relevant part: 
15. Claim []3:  The Court concludes Claim []3 does
not entitle [Hughes] to relief under HRPP Rule 40. [Hughes]
alleges that the District Court lacked proper jurisdictionover the complaint which contained the felony offenses. 
. . . . 
17. Even if Claim []3 had not been waived, the claim
is patently frivolous and without a trace of support in therecord. 
The procedures of HRS §§ 801-1, 806-6, 806-8 and
HRPP 5(c) and 7(h) established proper jurisdiction. More specifically, a complaint containing the charges againstdefendant was filed in District Court; the District Court,after a preliminary hearing, found probable cause to believethat defendant had committed the charged offenses andcommitted him to the Circuit Court for further proceedings;and the complaint, as well as the order committing defendantto the Circuit Court, were attached to the pleading filed inthe Circuit Court. . . . Accordingly, [Hughes] fails tostate a colorable claim in Claim []3. 
In 1989, when Hughes was charged, HRPP Rule 5(c)8/ 
firearm charges are an included offense of [Hughes's] attempted murdercharge," was not presented as a claim of illegal sentence in Petition No. 2.The crux of Hughes's argument raises an issue on the merits, not the sentence,see Thomas, 2021 WL 1699887, at *1 n.2, and the Circuit Court did not err inconcluding that Claims 4 and 7 had been waived. Moreover, Claims 4 and 7 eachfail to state a colorable claim. 
8/ At the time of the offenses, HRPP Rule 5(c) (1988) provided, in
relevant part: 
Rule 5. PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE DISTRICT COURT 
. . . . 
(c)
 Felonies.  In the district court, a defendant
charged with a felony shall not be called upon to plead, andproceedings shall be had in accordance with this section(c). 
. . . . 
(6) Disposition . 
If from the evidence it appears that
there is probable cause to believe that the felony charged,or an included felony, has been committed and that the 
12   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
empowered the district court to conduct a preliminary hearing to 
determine whether there was probable cause to commit a defendant charged with a felony to answer in the circuit court. Relatedly, HRPP Rule 7(b)(1)  provided that "[a] felony may be prosecuted by

Here, pursuant to HRPP Rule 7 (b) and (h), a complaint 
containing the felony charges against Hughes was filed in the 
District Court. Pursuant to HRPP Rule 5, the District Court, after a preliminary hearing, found probable cause to believe that Hughes had committed the charged offenses and committed him to the Circuit Court for further proceedings. Accordingly, the Circuit Court correctly ruled that the District Court had jurisdiction for this purpose. 
Hughes argues that the District Court "was without 
jurisdiction of the felony offense amended[,]" pursuant to HRS §§ 604-8 and 701-113. However, we do not read these statutes as depriving the district court of jurisdiction to conduct a preliminary hearing in accordance with HRPP Rule 5(c). See State 
v. Wilson, 55 Haw. 314, 316-17, 519 P.2d 228, 230 (1974) (noting that under HRS § 604-8, the district court did not have jurisdiction to try a felony, but under former Hawai# i Rules of 
Criminal Procedure Rule 5(d)(2), the district court was "empowered . . . to conduct a preliminary hearing, to hear evidence, and to discharge a defendant should probable cause not appear from the evidence adduced"). In addition, HRPP Rule 7(f)
10/ permitted the amendment of the complaint to correct a 
typographical error, and at the start of the preliminary hearing, Hughes confirmed that he had no objection to the amendment. 
Accordingly, the Circuit Court correctly ruled that 
Hughes failed to state a colorable claim in Claim 3. 
D. Illegal Sentence Issues 
Hughes contends that the Circuit Court erred in 
dismissing Claim 6, and that he was "[s]entenced [i]llegally to 
[m]ultiple [m]inimum [t]erms." 
In dismissing Claim 6, the Circuit Court stated, in 
relevant part: 
28. Claim []6:  The Court concludes Claim []6 does
not entitle [Hughes] to relief. In Claim []6, [Hughes] 
10/ At the time of the offenses, HRPP Rule 7(f) stated: "The court 
may permit a charge other than an indictment to be amended at any time before
verdict or finding if no additional or different offense is charged and ifsubstantial rights of the defendant are not prejudiced." 
14 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
alleges that the Hawaii Paroling Authority ("HPA") had no
authority to set his minimum terms and that "multiplestatutory term sentences (which are mandatory) occurringfrom multiple offenses which were based on single use offirearm from a single incident - were illegal,multiplicious, and prejudicial." 
. . . . 
30. Even if Claim []6 had not been waived, the claim
is patently frivolous and without a trace of support in therecord. 
First, as [Hughes] has already served the minimum
terms on the firearms convictions, the matter is moot.Further, the HPA has proper authority to set minimum termsaccording to law. See Williamson v. Hawai #i Paroling
Authority, 97 Hawai #i 183, 35 P.3d 210 (2001). Finally,
[Hughes]'s claim that his sentence is illegal due to"multiple sentences" for a "single use of firearm" isunavailing. As discussed in Claims []4 and []7, [Hughes]'ssentence involving multiple firearm convictions does notviolate the prohibition against double jeopardy.Accordingly, [Hughes] fails to state a colorable claim inClaim []6. 
On appeal, Hughes argues that the issue of his "illegal 
minimum term sentences" is not moot, because he continues to 
experience "prejudice" in matters of housing, custody level, classification, and available programming as a result of the sentences. His argument has merit, as "[c]riminal convictions have collateral consequences even after sentences have been served." State v. Tierney, 127 Hawai# i 157, 172, 277 P.3d 251, 
266 (2012) (citing Sibron v. New York, 392 U.S. 40, 55–56 (1968), for the proposition: "Although [a defendant's prison] term has been served, the results of the conviction may persist. Subsequent convictions may carry heavier penalties; civil rights may be affected. As the power to remedy an invalid sentence exists, a defendant is entitled to an opportunity to attempt to show that his conviction was invalid."). We conclude that the Circuit Court erred in ruling that, "as [Hughes] has already served the minimum terms on the firearms convictions, the matter is moot." 
However, the Circuit Court correctly determined that 
the HPA had authority to set Hughes's minimum terms. In Williamson, the supreme court discussed the broad mandate granted to the HPA pursuant to HRS § 706-669 (1993), noting that "the HPA has the 'exclusive authority to determine the minimum time which must be served before the prisoner will be eligible for parole'" and that "[t]he legislature apparently intended to grant the HPA 
15 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
broad discretion in establishing minimum terms." 97 Hawai# i at 
189, 35 P.3d at 216. 
Hughes contends that "the trier of fact (jury) did not
determine [Hughes's] multiple minimum term sentences[.]" Below, 
 
Hughes relied on 
Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), in 
arguing that the trier of fact and not the HPA should have determined his minimum term sentences. 
Hughes's reliance on Apprendi is misplaced for two 
reasons. First, the 
Hawai#i Supreme Court has held that 
"Apprendi does not apply retroactively in this jurisdiction to cases on collateral attack." State v. Gomes, 107 Hawai# i 308, 
314, 113 P.3d 184, 190 (2005). Second, 
Apprendi does not apply 
to the determination of minimum term sentences in these circumstances. See Draizen v. State
, No. CAAP-12-0000708, 2015 
WL 775031, at *2 (Haw. App. Feb. 24, 2015). Rather, in Apprendi, the Supreme Court held that "other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt." Gomes, 107 Hawai# i 
at 312, 113 P.3d at 188 (brackets omitted) (quoting Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 490). Here, none of Hughes's sentences exceeded the applicable statutory maximum. Thus, Apprendi does not apply, and the Circuit Court did not err in concluding that the HPA had authority to set Hughes's minimum terms. 
Hughes also alleged in Claim 6 that his sentence was 
illegal due to "[m]ultiple . . . sentences" for the "single use of a firearm." However, on appeal, he presents no argument on this allegation, and the issue is thus deemed waived. See HRAP 
Rule 28(b)(7); Rapozo v. State, 150 Hawai# i 66, 86, 497 P.3d 81, 
101 (2021). 
Accordingly, the Circuit Court correctly ruled that 
Hughes failed to state a colorable claim in Claim 6. 
E. Cumulative Error 
Hughes contends that the Circuit Court "committed a 
massive amount of structural and prejudicial error which only 
furthers and supports [Hughes's] Claim 9 of and pertaining [to] 
16 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
'Cumlative Error[.]'" (Emphasis omitted.) 
In dismissing Claim 9, the Circuit Court stated: 
40. Claim []9:  The Court concludes Claim []9 does
not entitle [Hughes] to relief. In Claim []9, [Hughes]
alleges the amount of errors in this matter amount tocumulative error and that the sheer volume of errors resulted [in] prejudice and therefore mandates reversal of
[Hughes]'s convictions. As indicated supra, no errors have
been found and [Hughes]'s Claims []1 through []8 fail to
state a colorable claim. Therefore, Claim []9 also fails tostate a colorable claim. 
For the reasons previously discussed, Hughes's claims 
either have been waived or fail to state a colorable claim. 
Accordingly, the Circuit court correctly ruled that Hughes failed to state a colorable claim in Claim 9. 
F. "Reserved Claims" 
Hughes presents additional "Reserved Claims" 10(A) and 
10(B) in the appendices of his Opening Brief, identified as 
"Exhibit C" and "Exhibit D," respectively. Specifically, Hughes argues that: 1) his sentence violates the Rule of Lenity; and 2) pre-trial counsel was ineffective. 
Hughes's reserved claims violate HRAP Rule 28(a), which 
provides in relevant part that "an opening or answering brief shall not exceed 35 pages[.]" HRAP further states: "If a brief raises ineffective assistance of counsel as a point of error, the appellant shall serve a copy of the brief on the attorney alleged to have been ineffective." HRAP Rule 28(a). Hughes's reserved claims 10(A) and 10(B) do not conform with HRAP Rule 28(a), as they are included in the appendices of the opening brief, on pages 58 and 70, respectively, well beyond the brief's 35-page limit. Further, the record contains no indication that Hughes served his ineffective assistance of counsel claim upon counsel whom he claims was ineffective, as required by HRPP Rule 40(f) and HRAP Rule 28(a). 
Additionally, the record contains no indication that 
Hughes raised Claims 10(A) and 10(B) in the Circuit Court. We do not consider these claims, which were raised for the first time on appeal. See Rapozo, 150 Hawai# i at 86, 497 P.3d at 101 
(citing Dan, 76 Hawai# i at 431, 879 P.2d at 536).
