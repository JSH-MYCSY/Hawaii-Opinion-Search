APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
(CR. NO. 16-1-0422(1))
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
Upon review of the record, it appears that:
(1) On January 31, 2017, Defendant-Appellant Harold
Hodges (Hodges), pro se, filed the notice of appeal;
(2) On April 12, 2017, Hodges filed the opening brief;
(3) On June 23, 2017, the court granted Plaintiff-
Appellee State of Hawaii's May 8, 2017 "Motion to Strike
[Hodges'] Opening Brief for Failure to Comply with the Hawaii
Rules of Appellate Procedure [(HRAP)]," and denied as moot
Hodges' May 22, 2017 motion for leave to file an amended opening
brief.  The court struck the opening brief, and ordered Hodges to
file a first amended opening brief within thirty days from the
date of the order.  The court cautioned Hodges that failure to
timely comply with the order may result in sanctions, including,
without limitation, the appeal being dismissed.  See HRAP 
Rule 30;NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

clerk to conventionally serve Appellant with the June 23, 2017
order and the August 24, 2017 order, and extended the due date
for the first amended opening brief to September 25, 2017.

(6) Hodges did not file a first amended opening brief
or request an extension of time;
(7) On October 6, 2017, the appellate clerk notified
Hodges and Gronna that the time for filing the first amended
opening brief had expired, the matter would be called to the
court's attention on October 16, 2017, for appropriate action,
which could include dismissal of the appeal, pursuant to HRAP
Rule 30, and Hodges may request relief from default by motion;
and

Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is
dismissed.
