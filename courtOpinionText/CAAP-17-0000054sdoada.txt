STATE OF HAWAI #I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
STEVEN E. YOUNG, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CR. NO. 16-1-0506)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Fujise, Acting, C.J., and Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
This case arises from a traffic stop conducted on
March 30, 2016, involving Defendant-Appellant Steven E. Young.
During the stop, Young was arrested on an outstanding warrant
unrelated to the instant offenses.  Before transporting Young to
the police station, Honolulu Police Department ("HPD") officers
allowed Young to make a telephone call and to move items from the
front compartment of his moped into the locked compartment under
the moped's seat ("seat compartment").  
While Young was moving the items into the seat
compartment, HPD Officer Daniel Farley observed through a
prescription bottle what he believed were "transparent pipes with
a bulbous end on each of them and a packet [of what] –- based on
[his] training and experience led [him] to believe [] was crystal
methamphetamine."  HPD Officer Alan Brissette likewise saw what
he said "appeared to be glass pipes, a ziplock bag containing a
crystal substance, and what appeared to be a small magnifying
glass all within a pill container, amber-colored pill container." 
HPD Criminalist Dawn Nakamura subsequently tested the crystal
substance in Young's ziplock bag and determined that it wasNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
methamphetamine.   
On March 31, 2016, the State charged Young, by Felony
Information, with one count of Promoting a Dangerous Drug in the
Third Degree and one count of Unlawful Use of Drug Paraphernalia
under Cr. No. 16-1-0506.  On May 3, 2016, Young filed a Motion to
Suppress Evidence and Statement ("Motion to Suppress") in which
he moved to suppress the prescription bottle and its contents. 
The Circuit Court of the First Circuit ("Circuit Court")1/ denied
the motion.
Young was convicted by a jury of one count of Promoting
a Dangerous Drug in the Third Degree, in violation of Hawaii
Revised Statutes ("HRS") section 712-1243 (2014),2/ and one count
of Unlawful Use of Drug Paraphernalia, in violation of HRS
section 329-43.5(a) (2010).3/  Young appeals from the December 1,
2016 Judgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence entered by the
Circuit Court in which he was sentenced to four years of
probation in Hawai# i's Opportunity Probation with Enforcement
program ("HOPE Probation") and one year of incarceration as a
special condition of probation. 
On appeal, Young contends that the Circuit Court (1)
1/ The Honorable Shirley M. Kawamura presided.
2/The statute provides:
(1) A person commits the offense of promoting a
dangerous drug in the third degree if the person knowingly
possesses any dangerous drug in any amount.
(2) Promoting a dangerous drug in the third degree is a
class C felony.
Haw. Rev. Stat. §712-1243.
3/The statute provides, in relevant part,
[I]t is unlawful for any person to use, or to possess with
intent to use, drug paraphernalia to plant, propagate,
cultivate, grow, harvest, manufacture, compound, convert,
produce, process, prepare, test, analyze, pack, repack, store,
contain, conceal, inject, ingest, inhale, or otherwise
introduce into the human body a controlled substance in
violation of this chapter.  Any person who violates this
section is guilty of a class C felony and upon conviction may
be imprisoned pursuant to section 706-660 and, if appropriate
as provided in section 706-641, fined pursuant to section 706-
640.
Haw. Rev. Stat. § 329-43.5(a).

erred in allowing the warrant into evidence, (2) abused its
discretion in sentencing him to one-year jail as a special
condition of probation and in ordering him to partake in sex
offender treatment, and (3) incorrectly denied his Motion to
Suppress.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Young's
points of error as follows and affirm.
(1) Despite Young's characterization of the point of
error, because Young offers no evidence that the underlying
warrant was admitted into evidence, we understand his first point
of error on appeal to contend that the Circuit Court erred in
allowing the arresting officer to refer in his testimony to the
warrant as the basis for Young's arrest because it constituted
evidence of other crimes, was more prejudicial than probative,
and violated State v. Pinero, 70 Haw. 509, 778 P.2d 704 (1989)
and State v. Pemberton, 71 Haw. 466, 796 P.2d 80 (1990).
Hawai#i Rules of Evidence ("HRE") Rule 403 provides
that "[a]lthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its
probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of
unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the
jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or
needless presentation of cumulative evidence."  Haw. R. Evid.
403.  HRE Rule 404(b) provides that evidence of other crimes,
wrongs, or acts may be admissible "where such evidence is
probative of another fact that is of consequence to the
determination of the action, such as proof of motive,
opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity,
modus operandi, or absence of mistake or accident."  Haw. R.
Evid. 404(b).  
The dispositive issue is whether the probative value of
the testimony regarding Young's outstanding warrant is
substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to
Young.  In weighing the probative value of the evidence against
the possible prejudicial effect, this court has considered
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
the strength of the evidence as to the commission of the other
crime, the similarities between the crimes, the interval of
time that has elapsed between the crimes, the need for the
evidence, the efficacy of alternative proof, and the degree to
which the evidence probably will rouse the jurty to
overmastering hostility.
State v. Hilario , 139 Hawai #i 546, 557–58, 394 P.3d 776, 787–88
(App. 2017) (quoting State v. Behrendt , 124 Hawai #i 90, 106, 237
P.3d 1156, 1172 (2010) (citation omitted).  The trial court's
balancing of the probative value versus the danger of unfair
prejudice is reviewed for abuse of discretion.  Hilario, 139
Hawai#i at 558, 394 P.3d at 788 (citing State v. Richie , 88
Hawai#i 19, 37, 960 P.2d 1227, 1245 (1998)).
Young's outstanding warrant was relevant because it
provided context as to why Young was arrested in the first place
and subsequently why Young moved the items in question into the
seat compartment.  Without mentioning Young's outstanding
warrant, there is no context as to why Young was arrested after a
simple traffic stop.  Therefore, the warrant was relevant and
admissible under HRE Rule 402.4/
Furthermore, the Circuit Court promptly gave the jury a
limiting instruction on the purpose for which the jury could
consider Young's outstanding warrant: 
THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen, you have heard evidence
that the defendant, Steven Young, may have had an outstanding
warrant. This evidence, if believed by you, is offered for the
limited purpose of explaining the reason why defendant may
have been initially arrested by the police. 
Do not consider this evidence for any other purpose. You
must not speculate as to the nature of the warrant, if any.
You must not use this evidence to conclude that because the
defendant may have been arrested on an outstanding warrant,
that he is a person of bad character and therefore must have
committed the offenses charged in this case. 
In considering the evidence for the limited purpose for
which it has been received, you must weigh it in the same
manner as you would all other evidence in this case and
consider it along with all other evidence in this case. Thank
you.
"'[J]uries are presumed to . . . follow all of the trial court's
4/This rule establishes that "[a]ll relevant evidence is admissible,
except as otherwise provided by the Constitutions of the United States and the
State of Hawaii, by statute, by these rules, or by other rules adopted by the
supreme court.  Evidence which is not relevant is not admissible."  Haw. R.
Evid. 402.

instructions[,]'" which includes curative instructions.  State v.
Knight, 80 Hawai #i 318, 327, 909 P.2d 1133, 1142 (1996) (ellipses
in original) (citing Sato v. Tawata , 79 Hawai #i 14, 21, 897 P.2d
941, 948 (1995)) (rejecting defendant's claim of prosecutorial
misconduct because the trial court promptly instructed the jury
to disregard the prosecution's improper question and the
corresponding answer of the witness).  
The discussion with regard to Young's warrant during
trial was explicitly limited to the purpose of "explaining the
reason why defendant may have been initially arrested by the
police[,]" and did not reveal the underlying basis for the
warrant.5/  Accordingly, it is unlikely that the jury was
distracted, see  Haw. R. Evid. 404 cmt., or that the evidence
"rouse[d] the jury to overmastering hostility." Hilario , 139
Hawai#i at 557, 394 P.3d at 787 (citing Behrendt, 124 Hawai# i at
106, 237 P.3d at 1172).  Therefore, the Circuit Court did not
abuse its discretion in concluding that the probative value of
providing context for Young's initial arrest was substantially
outweighed by unfair prejudice.  Cf., Pinero, 70 Haw. at 513–18,
778 P.2d at 708–11 (holding that the trial court abused its
discretion in admitting evidence about a prior similar situation
where defendant was discovered hiding in a closet and lunged
toward the officer, trying to grab the officer's gun, because the
probative value of the evidence was not great ); Pemberton , 71
Haw. at 470–73, 796 P.2d at 82-83 (holding that impeachment
testimony that defendant attacked another person on another
occasion using a different knife was not relevant for impeachment
purposes and was not relevant for any permissible purpose under
HRE Rule 404(b) and could only prejudice defendant by
demonstrating his propensity towards provoking knife fights).
5/The extent of the discussion on the outstanding warrant was as
follows: 
Q (by the State) Did you receive information that defendant
was to be arrested on an outstanding warrant?
A (by Officer Brissette)  I did.
The Circuit Court immediately gave its limiting instruction.  Officer
Brissette was then asked whether he was on scene when Young was informed of
the impending arrest for that warrant and he answered in the affirmative.
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
Therefore, the Circuit Court did not abuse its
discretion in allowing testimony that Young was arrested on an
outstanding warrant.
(2) Young's second point of error on appeal contends
that the Circuit Court abused its discretion in sentencing Young
to one-year in jail as a special term and condition of probation
because Young was being sentenced to HOPE Probation which
"already addresses a progressive sanction type method" and
therefore prejudices Young.6/  In sum, Young argues that when
taking into consideration the sentencing factors enunciated under
HRS section 706-606, the Circuit Court should have sentenced him
to four years of HOPE Probation rather than the one-year term of
incarceration and four years HOPE Probation "based upon the
unique facts of this case."
HRS section 706-606 (2014) provides factors to be
considered in imposing a sentence.  Under this statute, "[t]he
court, in determining the particular sentence to be imposed,
shall consider: . . . [t]he kinds of sentences available[.]" 
Haw. Rev. Stat. § 706-606(3).  The kinds of sentences available
in this case include "probation as authorized by part II [of HRS
Chapter 706]" and "imprison[ment] for a term as authorized by
part IV [of HRS chapter 706.]"  Haw. Rev. Stat. § 706-605(a), (c)
(2014).  The court, however "shall not sentence defendant to
probation and imprisonment except as authorized by part II [of
HRS chapter 706]."  Haw. Rev. Stat. § 706-605(2) (emphasis
added). 
Part II of HRS chapter 706 specifically addresses
probation.  Accordingly, when the court has sentenced a defendant
to probation, the period of probation shall be "[f]ive years upon
conviction of a class B or class C felony under part II, V, or VI
of chapter 707, chapter 709, and part I of chapter 712 and four
years upon conviction of any other class B or C felony[.]" Haw.
Rev. Stat. § 706-623(1)(b) (2014).  In exercising its discretion, 
6/Young additionally argues that the Circuit Court erred in ordering
Young to partake in sex offender treatment because Young was not convicted of
a new sex crime, but rather, failed to report for previous sex crimes.  This
argument is outside the scope of this appeal, however, as the judgment from
which this appeal is taken does not order sex offender treatment. 
6NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
[t]he court may provide, as further conditions of a sentence
of probation, to the extent that the conditions are reasonably
related to the factors set forth in section 706-606 and to the
extent that the conditions involve only deprivations of
liberty or property as are reasonably necessary for the
purposes indicated in section 706-606(2), that the defendant:
(a) Serve a term of imprisonment to be determined by the
court at sentencing . . . not exceeding one year in
class C felony cases[.]
Haw. Rev. Stat. 706-624(2)(a) (2014).  
In , a misdemeanor case, the supreme
court, looking to HRS section 706-624, stated that "where the
sentencing court decides to combine probation and imprisonment in
a sentence, it may do so if imprisonment is made a condition  of
the sentence of probation rather than a separate sentence, and
only up to a maximum period of six months in the case of a
misdemeanor." 97 Hawai# i 430, 435, 39 P.3d 557, 562 (2002). 
Under Sumera, the Circuit Court was therefore allowed to combine
probation and imprisonment in Young's sentence as long as
imprisonment was made a condition of the probation sentence
rather than a separate sentence and as long as the maximum period
of imprisonment was one year in the case of Young's class C
felonies.  See  Haw. Rev. Stat. § 706-624(2)(a); Sumera, 97
Hawaii at 435, 39 P.3d at 562.State v. Sumera
#
Here, the Circuit Court sentenced Young to a four-year
term of probation, in accord with the maximum probationary period
for a class C felony pursuant to HRS section 706-623(1)(b), and a
one-year term of imprisonment as a special condition of
probation, in accord with the maximum imprisonment period for a
class C felony pursuant to HRS section 706-624(2)(a) and in
accord with the guidelines set forth in Sumera.  As such, the
Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Young.
(3) Young's third point of error on appeal is that the
Circuit Court incorrectly denied his Motion to Suppress because
Officer Brisette allegedly could not see inside the prescription
bottle and because the bottle was inside the closed seat
compartment at the time Officer Curtis Davis demanded access to
7NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
the bottle without a warrant.7/  The issue with regard to this
point of error is whether the plain view doctrine is satisfied in
this case.  The dispositive factor in the analysis is the
credibility of the State's witnesses.
"'[I]t is well-settled that an appellate court will not
pass upon issues dependent upon the credibility of witnesses and
the weight of the evidence; this is the province of the [trier of
fact].'"  State v. Mattiello, 90 Hawai# i 255, 259, 978 P.2d 693,
697 (1999) (alteration in original) (quoting State v. Stocker , 90
Hawai#i 85, 90, 976 P.2d 399, 404 (1999)).  "'The appellate court
will neither reconcile conflicting evidence nor interfere with
the decision of the trier of fact based on the witnesses'
credibility or the weight of the evidence.'"  State v. Gaston ,
108 Hawai# i 308, 311, 119 P.3d 616, 619 (App. 2005) (quoting
State v. Mitchell , 94 Hawai #i 388, 393, 15 P.3d 314, 319 (App.
2000)).
Appellate review of factual determinations made by the trial
court deciding pretrial motions in a criminal case is governed
by the clearly erroneous standard. A finding of fact is
clearly erroneous when (1) the record lacks substantial
evidence to support the finding, or (2) despite substantial
evidence in support of the finding, the appellate court is
left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has
been made. The circuit court's conclusions of law are reviewed
under the right/wrong standard. . . .
State v. Ramos , 93 Hawai #i 502, 507, 6 P.3d 374, 379 (App. 2000)
(quoting State v. Balberdi , 90 Hawai #i 16, 20–21, 975 P.2d 773,
777–78 (App. 1999)). 
Under the plain view doctrine, "the view takes place
after an intrusion into activities or areas as to which there is
a reasonable expectation of privacy.  The officer has already
intruded, and, if his [or her] intrusion is justified, the
objects in plain view, sighted inadvertently, will be
admissible."  State v. Meyer , 78 Hawai #i, 308, 312-13, 893 P.2d
159, 163-64 (1995) (alteration in original) (quoting State v.
Kaaheena, 59 Haw. 23, 28, 575 P.2d 462, 466 (1978)).  In a plain
7/From the August 25, 2016 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and
Order Denying Defendant's Motion to Suppress Evidence and Statement, Young
challenges Findings of Fact ("FOF") 7 and 8, as clearly erroneous, and
Conclusions of Law ("COL") 5, 15, 16, and 20, as wrong, but fails to provide
any argument to support his challenge that these findings were clearly
erroneous and that these conclusions were wrong.
8NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
view observation, a "search" has not occurred in the
constitutional sense and a defendant cannot claim that he had a
reasonable expectation of privacy.  Meyer, 78 Hawai #i at 312, 893
P.2d at 163.  The following three factors are required to justify
a plain view observation: "(1) prior justification for the
intrusion; (2) inadvertent discovery; and (3) probable cause to
believe the item is evidence of a crime or contraband."  Id. at
314, 893 P.2d at 165 (citing  Coolidge v. New Hampshire , 403 U.S.
443, 465-73 (1971)).  All three factors are present here. 
First, there was prior justification in the form of the
traffic stop and subsequent arrest for an outstanding warrant.  
The Circuit Court found that Officer Davis "observed a moped
driving in front of him with a broken taillight and conducted a
permissible traffic stop as a result of the violation[,]" (FOF 1)
and concluded that the permissible traffic stop constituted a
prior justification for the intrusion (COL 19). (Emphasis added.)
Young does not address this finding or conclusion; therefore, we
are bound by them.  See State v. Torres , 125 Hawai #i 382, 398,
262 P.3d 1006, 1022 (2011) (ruling that "Petitioner did not
challenge any of the findings of the court, and, therefore, such
findings are binding on this court.");  Stanford Carr Dev. Corp.
v. Unity House, Inc. , 111 Hawai #i 286, 303 n.10, 141 P.3d 459,
476 n.10 (2006) ("It is axiomatic that '[i]f a finding is not
properly attacked, it is binding; and any conclusion which
follows from it and is a correct statement of law is valid.'"
(quoting Kawamata Farms, Inc. v. United Agri Prod., 86 Hawai #i
214, 252, 948 P.2d 1055, 1093 (1997))). 
Second, evidence supports the conclusion that the
discovery of drugs and paraphernalia was inadvertent.  Officers
Davis, Brissett, and Farley testified that they observed by means
of Young's own volition, Young placed the pill bottle containing
what appeared to be drug paraphernalia and a crystalline
substance inside the seat compartment.  Officer Brissette further
testified that after Young dropped the prescription bottle into
the seat compartment, Young did not close the compartment,
Officer Brissette did not order him to open the compartment
again, and the bottle was not wrapped in a rag.  
9NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
Although Young testified to the contrary, the Circuit
Court found the officers' testimonies to be credible:
Officer Farley credibly testified that he watched Defendant
with the aid of streetlights and a flashlight and saw
Defendant remove a pill bottle from the moped's front storage
area. Defendant then tried to cover the pill bottle with a rag
but Officer Farley was able to see inside the pill bottle
before it was covered and placed in the seat compartment.
Officer Farley observed two (2) glass pipes with bulbous ends
as well as a clear plastic baggie containing a
crystalline-like substance inside of the container.
 
The Circuit Court thereafter concluded that the translucent case
being brought out of the moped by Young led the officers to make
an inadvertent discovery (COL 19).
Although Young challenges FOF 7, he provides no express
argument as to why this finding was clearly erroneous.  This
finding is a credibility determination by the Circuit Court, and
therefore we will not disturb it on appeal.  See Mattiello, 90
Hawai#i at 259, 978 P.2d at 697 ("[I]t is well-settled that an
appellate court will not pass upon issues dependent upon the
credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence; this is
the province of the [trier of fact]." (citation and internal
quotation marks omitted)); Gaston, 108 Hawai# i at 311, 119 P.3d
at 619 ("The appellate court will neither reconcile conflicting
evidence nor interfere with the decision of the trier of fact
based on the witnesses' credibility or the weight of the
evidence." (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). 
Taken together, the testimonies of Officer Davis, Officer
Brissette, and Officer Farley support the Circuit Court's finding
that the officers inadvertently saw the drugs and paraphernalia
inside the prescription bottle as Young was moving the
prescription bottle from the front compartment to the seat
compartment of the moped.
Third, at the hearing on Young's Motion to Suppress,
all three HPD officers testified that they had training and
experience with illegal drugs and drug paraphernalia.  Taken
together, the experience and training of Officer Davis, Officer
Farley, and Officer Brissette with drugs and drug paraphernalia
supported a finding that the officers had probable cause to
believe that the glass pipes and crystalline substance inside the
prescription bottle were evidence of a crime or contraband.  See
10NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
State v. Phillips, 138 Hawai# i 321, 346, 382 P.3d 133, 158 (2016)
(citing State v. Groves, 65 Haw. 104, 114, 649 P.2d 366, 373
(1982) (relying on a police officer's experience and expertise to
establish probable cause)) (determining that a search warrant
application based, in part on, an officer's affidavit describing
her experience, training, and qualifications was supported by
probable cause).
 Based on the aforementioned, the record indicates that
the three factors required to justify a plain view observation
were present at the time the HPD officers discovered the
prescription bottle and the drugs and drug paraphernalia therein,
and subsequently that a "search" in the constitutional sense did
not occur.  See Meyer , 78 Hawai #i at 314, 893 P.2d at 165 (citing
Coolidge, 403 U.S. at 465-73).  Young therefore fails to show
that the Circuit Court erred in denying the Motion to Suppress.
Therefore, the December 1, 2016 Judgment of Conviction
and Probation Sentence of the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
is affirmed.
