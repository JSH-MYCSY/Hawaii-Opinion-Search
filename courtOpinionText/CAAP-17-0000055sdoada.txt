Defendant-Appellant Steven E. Young (Young) appeals
from the Judgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence ( Judgment)
entered against him and in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee State of
Hawai#i (State) on December 1, 2016, in the Circuit Court of the

Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 846E-9(a)(2) and (c) (2014);2 and
(2) one count of Failure to Comply with Covered Offender
Registration Requirements, in violation of HRS § 846E-9(a)(12)
and (c) (2014).3  On the same day, Young was sentenced to four
years of probation, with special conditions.  The special
conditions included, inter alia , one year of incarceration, with
credit for time served, and satisfactory participation in the
Hawai#i Sex Offender Treatment Program as follows:
2HRS § 846E-9(a)(2) and (c) provide in relevant part:

June 30, 2009, and beginning on July 1, 2009,
once every year, during the thirty-day period
following the offender's date of birth, to the
chief of police where the covered offender's
residence is located, or to such other
department or agency designated by the attorney
general;
. . . . 
(c)  Failure to comply with covered offender
registration requirements is a class C felony.

YOU SHALL:
. . . . 
E. Serve a term of imprisonment of ONE (1) YEAR , with
credit for time already served.  No early release. 
Mittimus to issue forthwith;
. . . . 
S. Participate satisfactorily in the Hawaii Sex Offender
Treatment Program (HSOTP) with the provision that you
obtain and maintain sex offender treatment, as
approved by your probation officer, at your own
expense until clinically discharged with the
concurrence of your probation officer. . . .  
On appeal, Young raises two points of error contending: 
(1) that finding him guilty of violating HRS chapter 846E
violated his equal protection rights and was therefore plainly
erroneous; and (2) the Circuit Court abused its discretion in
sentencing him because (a) it should not have included one year
of incarceration as a condition of probation; and (b) sex
offender treatment was unnecessary because he was not convicted
of a new sex crime but rather for failing to report for previous
crimes.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve Young's points of error as follows:
(1) Young contends that sex offender reporting
requirements violated his rights under both the Hawai# i and
federal constitutions by subjecting him to public stigma for a
lifetime. 
"Generally, a guilty plea made voluntarily and
intelligently precludes a defendant from later asserting any
nonjurisdictional claims, including constitutional challenges to
the pretrial proceedings."  State v. Morin, 71 Haw. 159, 162, 785
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
P.2d 1316, 1318 (1990) (citations omitted).  "A plea of [no
contest] is equivalent to a plea of guilty in terms of waiving
alleged nonjurisdictional defects."  Id.  (citations omitted). 
"An exception to this general rule is a plea conditioned upon the
right to appeal certain pretrial rulings."  Id. at 162, 785 P.2d
at 1319.  
Here, Young pled no contest to both counts on July 21,
2016; his plea was not conditioned on the right to appeal
constitutional issues.  Young does not contend, nor do we
conclude, that his plea was not entered voluntarily and
intelligently.  Moreover, he does not argue, and we do not
conclude, that his constitutional argument is jurisdictional. 
Accordingly, Young waived his constitutional challenge to his
conviction when he entered his no-contest plea.
(2) Young contends that the Circuit Court abused its
discretion in sentencing him to one year of incarceration as a
condition of probation because "the HOPE probation program
already addresses a progressive sanction type method."  In sum,
Young argues that, when taking into consideration the sentencing
factors enunciated under HRS § 706-606 (2014), the Circuit Court
should have sentenced him to four years of HOPE Probation rather
than the one-year term of incarceration and four years of HOPE
Probation "based upon the unique facts of this case."
HRS § 706-606 provides factors to be considered in
imposing a sentence.  Under this statute, "[t]he court, in
determining the particular sentence to be imposed, shall
consider: . . . [t]he kinds of sentences available[.]"  HRS
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
§ 706-606(3).  The kinds of sentences available in this case
include "probation as authorized by part II [of HRS chapter 706]"
and "imprison[ment] for a term as authorized by part IV [of HRS
chapter 706.]"  HRS § 706-605(1)(a) and (c) (2014).  The court,
however, "shall not sentence a defendant to probation and
imprisonment except as authorized by part II [of HRS chapter
706]."  HRS § 706-605(2). 
Part II of HRS chapter 706 specifically addresses
probation.  When a court has sentenced a defendant to probation,
the period of probation shall be "[f]ive years upon conviction of
a class B or class C felony under part II, V, or VI of chapter
707, chapter 709, and part I of chapter 712 and four years upon
conviction of any other class B or C felony[.]"  HRS § 706-
623(1)(b) (2014).  In exercising its discretion, 
[t]he court may provide, as further conditions of a
sentence of probation, to the extent that the conditions
are reasonably related to the factors set forth in section
706-606 and to the extent that the conditions involve only
deprivations of liberty or property as are reasonably
necessary for the purposes indicated in section 706-606(2),
that the defendant:
(a) Serve a term of imprisonment to be determined by the
court at sentencing . . . not exceeding one year in
class C felony cases[.]
HRS § 706-624(2)(a) (2014).  
In State v. Sumera, a misdemeanor case, looking to HRS
§ 706-624, the supreme court stated that "where the sentencing
court decides to combine probation and imprisonment in a
sentence, it may do so if imprisonment is made a condition  of the
sentence of probation rather than a separate sentence, and only
up to a maximum period of six months in the case of a
misdemeanor."  97 Hawai# i 430, 435, 39 P.3d 557, 562 (2002).  We
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
conclude that, under Sumera, the Circuit Court did not abuse its
discretion in combining probation and imprisonment in Young's
sentence, provided that imprisonment was made a condition of the
probation sentence rather than a separate sentence.  The maximum
period of imprisonment was one year in the case of Young's class
C felonies.  See  HRS § 706-624(2)(a); Sumera, 97 Hawai# i at 435,
39 P.3d at 562.
Here, the Circuit Court sentenced Young to a four-year
term of probation, in accord with the maximum probationary period
for a class C felony pursuant to HRS § 706-623(1)(b), and a one-
year term of imprisonment as a special condition of probation, in
accord with the maximum imprisonment period for a class C felony
pursuant to HRS § 706-624(2)(a) and in accord with the guidelines
set forth in Sumera .  Thus, we conclude that the Circuit Court
did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Young to one year of
incarceration as a condition of probation.
Young also contends that the Circuit Court abused its
discretion in sentencing him to participate in sex offender
treatment because he had not been convicted of another sex crime,
but merely a failure to report periodically to authorities.
In State v. Solomon , 107 Hawai #i 117, 120, 111 P.3d 12,
15 (2005), Solomon pled guilty to one count of abuse of a family
or household member.  The trial court of the First Circuit
sentenced him, inter alia , to undergo sex offender evaluation and
treatment as a condition of his probation.  Id. at 121–22, 111
P.3d at 16–17.  On appeal, Solomon argued that his conviction was
not for a sexual offense, and therefore sex offender evaluation
6NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
and treatment were inappropriate.  Id. at 128, 111 P.3d at 23. 
However, the supreme court noted that the trial court was aware
of many factors warranting the sentence, including a prior
conviction for sexual assault in the fourth degree and a
psychosexual assessment concluding that Solomon was "an untreated
sex offender."  Id. at 130-31, 111 P.3d at 25-26.  The supreme
court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in
requiring that Solomon undergo sex offender evaluation and
treatment.  Id. at 131, 111 P.3d at 26.  
Here, although Young was not convicted of a new sex
offense, the Circuit Court had information before it indicating
that Young had a history of improper sexual behavior, including
prior convictions for sexual assault in the second degree and
sexual assault in the third degree.  Furthermore, it appears that
Young never completed the sex offender treatment stemming from
his previous sexual assault convictions.  Therefore, we conclude
that the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in ordering
Young to undergo sex offender treatment. 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's December 1, 2016
Judgment is affirmed.
