NO. CAAP-17-0000057
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
TYRONE K.N. GALDONES, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P.
 NO. 16-1-0012; CR. NO. 99-0-1690)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(Leonard, Presiding Judge, and Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record in CAAP-17-0000057, it
 
appears that this court lacks appellate jurisdiction over the
 
appeal because the appeal was untimely. 
Petitioner-Appellant Tyrone K.N. Galdones (Appellant) 
appeals from the "Order Denying Without a Hearing Petitioner Tyrone Galdones' Third Petition for Post-Conviction Relief," filed on December 7, 2016 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit. Pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 641-11 and Hawai
'i Rules of Penal Procedure ("HRPP") Rule 40(h), "appeals 
from proceedings for post-conviction relief may be made from a judgment entered in the proceeding and must be taken in accordance with Rule 4(b) of the Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP)." Grattafiori v. State, 79 Hawai 'i 10, 13, 897 
P.2d 937, 940 (1995) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). "[P]ursuant to HRAP Rule 4(b), an appeal from an order denying post-conviction relief must either be filed within thirty days after the entry of the order denying the HRPP Rule 40 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
 
petition or, in the alternative, after the announcement but
 
before the entry of the order." Id.
 
Therefore, Appellant had until January 6, 2017 to file
 
a notice of appeal. Appellant, however, did not file a notice of
 appeal until February 3, 2017. Even considering that Appellant
 dated his notice of appeal on January 26, 2017, the notice of
 appeal was untimely. 
"[W]e must dismiss an appeal on our motion if we lack
 
jurisdiction." Id. (quoting State v. Brandimart, 68 Haw. 495,
 
497, 720 P.2d 1009, 1010 (1986). Accordingly, the Intermediate
 Court of Appeals does not have appellate jurisdiction over the
 December 7, 2016 Order Denying Without a Hearing Petitioner
 Tyrone Galdones' Third Petition for Post-Conviction Relief. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal in
 
CAAP-17-0000057 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
