APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 14-1-0371-02)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Ginoza, C.J., Reifurth and Chan, JJ.)
Defendants-Appellants Michele C. Rundgren; Michele C.
Rundgren, Trustee of the Michele C. Rundgren Revocable Trust,
Dated October 6, 2005; Todd Rundgren; and Todd Rundgren, Trustee
of the Todd Rundgren Revocable Trust, Dated November 1, 2005
(collectively, the Rundgrens) appeal from the Judgment entered on
April 15, 2016, by the Circuit Court of the First CircuitNOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(circuit court).1  The Rundgrens also challenge the following
underlying orders issued by the circuit court: the "Findings of
Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion
for Summary Judgment Against All Parties and for Interlocutory
Decree of Foreclosure" entered on April 15, 2016; and the "Order
Denying [the Rundgrens'] Motion for Reconsideration" entered on
January 6, 2017.  The Judgment and challenged orders were entered
against the Rundgrens and in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee JPMorgan
Chase Bank, National Association (JPMorgan Chase). 
On appeal, the Rundgrens contend that: (1) the circuit
court erred in granting summary judgment because there are
genuine issues of material fact concerning JPMorgan Chase's
standing to foreclose; (2) the attorney affirmation filed by
JPMorgan Chase's counsel was not in compliance with Hawaii
Revised Statutes (HRS ) ยง 667-17 (2016); (3) the circuit court
lacked jurisdiction as an improper venue for presiding over the
foreclosure of Kauai residential property; and (4) the circuit
court lacked jurisdiction to foreclose on the Rundgrens who had
timely canceled their mortgage loan pursuant to the Title 15
U.S.C. ยง 1601, the Truth In Lending Act.  
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
well as the relevant legal authorities, we resolve the Rundgrens'
points of error as follows, and we vacate and remand.
(1) Summary Judgment
The Hawai #i Supreme Court's opinion in Bank of America,
N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai# i 361, 390 P.3d 1248 (2017) is
dispositive for purposes of this appeal.  In Reyes-Toledo, the
Hawai#i Supreme Court held in a judicial foreclosure action that
in order to establish a right to foreclose, the foreclosing
plaintiff must establish standing, or entitlement to enforce the
subject note, at the time the action was commenced.  Id.  at
1  The Honorable Bert I. Ayabe presided.
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
367-70, 390 P.3d at 1254-57.  In its answering brief, JPMorgan
Chase recognizes that Reyes-Toledo  affects the outcome in this
appeal.
Reyes-Toledo notes that a foreclosing plaintiff must
typically "prove the existence of an agreement, the terms of the
agreement, a default by the mortgagor under the terms of the
agreement, and giving of the cancellation notice."  Id.  at 367,
390 P.3d at 1254 (citing Bank of Honolulu, N.A. v. Anderson , 3
Haw. App. 545, 551, 654 P.2d 1370, 1375 (1982)).  Furthermore,
"[a] foreclosing plaintiff must also prove its entitlement to
enforce the note and mortgage."  Id.  The supreme court then
expressed that "[a] foreclosing plaintiff's burden to prove
entitlement to enforce the note overlaps with the requirements of
standing in foreclosure actions as 'standing is concerned with
whether the parties have the right to bring suit.'"  Id.
(brackets omitted) (quoting Mottl v. Miyahira , 95 Hawai #i 381,
388, 23 P.3d 716, 723 (2001)).  Because "standing relates to the
invocation of the court's jurisdiction, it is not surprising that
standing must be present at the commencement of the case." 
Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai# i at 368, 390 P.3d at 1255.  Thus, a
foreclosing plaintiff must establish entitlement to enforce the
note and standing to foreclose on the mortgaged property at the
commencement of the suit.  Id.
Like the foreclosing bank in Reyes Toledo, JPMorgan
Chase was granted a decree and judgment of foreclosure pursuant
to a summary judgment ruling.  In support of its summary judgment
motion, JPMorgan Chase attached, inter alia, two documents to
demonstrate that it possessed the subject Adjustable Rate Note
(Note): (1) a "Declaration of Amounts Due and Owing" by Tracy
Charlton ( Charlton Declaration ), executed on April 29, 2015,
attesting that "[JPMorgan Chase] is  in possession of the original
note" (emphasis added); and (2) the Note, which shows that it was
endorsed in blank by Washington Mutual Bank, F.A., the lender for
the Note.  Like in Reyes-Toledo, this evidence fails to
demonstrate that JPMorgan Chase was entitled to enforce the Note
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
at the time the action commenced.
There is no other evidence in the record to establish
JPMorgan Chase's entitlement to enforce the Note when it
commenced this action.2  Although the Complaint for Foreclosure
(Complaint ), filed on February 10, 2014, alleges that "[JPMorgan
Chase] is the holder of the Note," the Note is not attached to
the Complaint and there is no verification or evidence asserting
or establishing that JPMorgan Chase was in possession of the
blank endorsed note at the time the Complaint was filed.3
 Viewing the facts and inferences in the light most
favorable to the Rundgrens, as we must for purposes of a summary
judgment ruling, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to
whether JPMorgan Chase was entitled to enforce the subject Note
at the time this foreclosure action was commenced.  Therefore,
pursuant to Reyes-Toledo , the circuit court erred in granting
JPMorgan Chase's motion for summary judgment.
(2)  Venue
Because we vacate the circuit court's summary judgment
ruling and must remand, we also address the Rundgrens's claim
that the circuit court was an improper venue.  In this regard,
the record indicates that the Rundgrens failed to raise a defense
based on improper venue in their Answer to JPMorgan's Complaint
to Foreclose ( Answer) or in a motion prior to filing their
Answer, and thus their argument on appeal about improper venue is
deemed waived.
Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure ( HRCP) Rule 12(b)(3)
provides that:#
2  JPMorgan Chase submitted an attorney affirmation on June 5, 2015, but
it appears that in Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Behrendt, SCAP-16-0000645, 2018
WL 1325153 (Haw. Mar. 15, 2018), the Hawai #i Supreme Court implicitly did not
give any evidentiary merit to an attorney affirmation in the record in that
case.  See Wilmington Savings Fund Soc. v. Yasuda , No. CAAP-17-0000433, 2018
WL 1904909 (Hawai #i App. Apr. 23, 2018) (Ginoza, J., concurring).
3  Because none of the pertinent declarations attest that JPMorgan Chase
had possession of the Note at the time the Complaint was filed, we need not
address whether the witnesses submitting declarations could properly
authenticate records under U.S. Bank N.A. v. Mattos, 140 Hawai #i 26, 398 P.3d
615 (2017).
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Every defense . . . shall be asserted in the responsive
pleading thereto if one is required, except that the
following defenses may at the option of the pleader be made
by motion: . . . (3) improper venue[.]  A motion making any
of these defenses shall be made before pleading if a further
pleading is permitted.
Further, HRCP Rule 12(h)(1)(B) states that a defense of improper
venue is waived "if it is neither made by motion under this rule
nor included in a responsive pleading or an amendment thereof
permitted by [HRCP] Rule 15(a) to be made as a matter of course."
In Rearden Family Tr. v. Wisenbaker , 101 Hawai #i 237,
247-248, 65 P.3d 1029, 1039-1040 (2003), the Hawai #i Supreme
Court stated that, "[w]here we have patterned a rule of procedure
after an equivalent rule within the FRCP, interpretations of the
rule by the federal courts are deemed to be highly persuasive in
the reasoning of this court." (citations and internal brackets
omitted).  See U.S. Bank Nat. Ass'n v. Bernadino, 2016 WL
2984868, *5 n.7 (Hawai #i App. 2016) (noting that "HRCP Rules
12(b), (g), and (h) are substantively similar to [Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure ( FRCP)] Rules 12(b), (g), and (h)."). 
Pertinent federal authority provides that a defense based on
improper venue is waived if not raised in a responsive pleading
or in a motion to dismiss.  See Stjernholm v. Peterson , 83 F.3d
347, 349 (10th Cir. 1996) (stating that "[a] party waives the
right to challenge venue if he fails to raise that defense either
in his responsive pleading or in a motion to dismiss under [FRCP]
12(b)(3)[,]" citing FRCP 12(h)(1)); see also  5C Wright & Miller,
Federal Practice & Procedure: Civil 3d  ยง 1391 at 515 (2004) ("If
a party wishes to raise any of these [Rule 12(b) (2-5)] defenses,
that must be done at the time the first significant defensive
move is made [such as] a responsive pleading.").
Based on the record in this case, the Rundgrens have
waived their right to challenge venue. 
We need not address the Rundgrens's remaining points on
appeal.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the following
entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit are vacated:
