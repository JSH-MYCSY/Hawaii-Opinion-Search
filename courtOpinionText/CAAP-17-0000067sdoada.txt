APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Fujise, Acting Chief Judge, Leonard and Chan, JJ.)
Union Complainant-Appellee-Appellant United Public
Workers, AFSCME, Local 646, AFL-CIO (UPW ) appeals from the
February 7, 2017 Order Granting Appellant Hawaii Health System
Corporation's Motion for Partial Stay of Enforcement of Hawaii
Labor Relations Board Order No. 3199, Dated Oct. 28, 2016 (Filed
on Dec. 2, 2016) (Order Granting Partial Stay ), entered in the
Circuit Court of the First Circuit.1 
On July 25, 2016, UPW filed a Prohibited Practice
Complaint ( Complaint ) with Appellee Hawai #i Labor Relations Board
1The Honorable Rhonda A. Nishimura presided.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(HLRB), which alleged, inter alia, that Employer Respondent-
Appellant-Appellee Hawai #i Health Systems Corporation ( HHSC)
committed prohibited practices by failing to negotiate regarding
a change in smoking policies at its facilities. 
On August 22, 2016, UPW filed a motion for summary
judgment ( MSJ).  The HLRB granted the MSJ in part, and denied it
in part, in Order No. 3199: Order Denying Hawaii Health Systems
Corporation's Motion to Dismiss; and Granting, in Part, and
Denying, in Part, United Public Workers, AFSCME, Local 646, AFL-
CIO's Motion for Summary Judgment ( Order No. 3199 ). 
On November 28, 2016, HHSC appealed to the Circuit
Court.  On December 2, 2016, HHSC moved for partial stay of Order
No. 3199, pending the outcome of the appeal.  On February 7,
2017, the Circuit Court issued its Order Granting Partial Stay.  
On March 16, 2017, UPW commenced this secondary appeal,
challenging the Order Granting Partial Stay.
The Circuit Court later vacated the Order Granting
Partial Stay, on August 4, 2017.  This appeal, however, remains.  
UPW raises four points of error, contending that the
Circuit Court erred when it:  (1) determined that Hawaii Revised
Statutes ( HRS) chapter 380 did not apply because the issue was
not a "labor dispute" but rather a statutory dispute; (2) granted
the partial stay without complying with the requirements of HRS
chapter 380; (3) determined that HHSC was likely to prevail on
the merits despite the presumptive validity of Order No. 3199;
and (4) determined that HHSC was likely to prevail on the merits
despite conflicting authority.
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, as well as the
relevant statutory and case law, we resolve UPW's points of error
as follows:
(1) We first address HHSC's argument that this court
does not have appellate jurisdiction because this appeal is
interlocutory and was not made in compliance with Hawai #i Rules
of Civil Procedure ( HRCP) Rule 54(b)2 and HRS § 641-1(b) (2016).3 
UPW argues that this appeal lies as of right, pursuant
to HRS § 380-10 (2015).4  HRS § 380-10 states that "[w]henever
2HRCP 54(b) provides in relevant part:
(b) Judgment upon multiple claims or involving multiple
parties.  When more than one claim for relief is presented in
an action . . . or when multiple parties are involved, the
court may direct the entry of a final judgment as to one or
more but fewer than all of the claims or parties only upon
an express determination that there is no just reason for
delay and upon an express direction for the entry of
judgment.       
3HRS § 641-1(b) provides in relevant part:
§641-1 Appeals as of right or interlocutory, civil
matters.
. . .  
(b)  Upon application made within the time providedby
the rules of court, an appeal in a civil matter may be
allowed by a circuit court in its discretion from an order
denying a motion to dismiss or from any interlocutory
judgment, order, or decree whenever the circuit court may
think the same advisable for the speedy termination of
litigation before it. The refusal of the circuit court to
allow an appeal from an interlocutory judgment, order, or
decree shall not be reviewable by any other court.
4HRS § 380-10 provides in relevant part:
§380-10 Appeal.   Whenever any court of the State
issues or denies any temporary injunction in a case
involving or growing out of a labor dispute, an appeal shall
lie as of right, subject to chapter 602, in the manner 
(continued...)
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
any court of the State issues or denies any temporary injunction
in a case involving or growing out of a labor dispute, an appeal
shall lie as of right[.]" (Emphasis added).  Accordingly, we
consider (1) whether the "involves or grows out of" requirement
is met, and (2) whether the "labor dispute" requirement is met. 
See HRS § 380-10.  If this case involves or grows out of a labor
dispute, then UPW's appeal lies "as of right," and this court has
appellate jurisdiction.  See id.  
A case "involves or grows out of" a labor dispute when
"the case involves persons . . . who are members of . . . an
affiliated organization of employers or employees; whether the
dispute is (A) between one or more employers or associations of
employers and one or more employees or associations of
employees[.]"  HRS § 380-13(1) (2015).  Here, the UPW is an
affiliated organization of employees, and the dispute is between
the employer, HHSC, and the association of employees, UPW. 
Therefore, the requirement that the case "involves or grows out
of" a labor dispute has been met.  
We note that the Circuit Court determined that the
situation did not involve a labor dispute, stating that "it does
not appear to the court that this is a controversy arising out of
a labor dispute such as there's picketing, or there's an ongoing
labor dispute."  Nevertheless, the term "labor dispute" includes
"any controversy concerning terms or conditions of employment[.]"  
HRS § 380-13(3).  Therefore, we analyze (a) whether what occurred
4(...continued)
provided for civil appeals from the circuit courts,
notwithstanding any provision of section 641-1. 
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
constituted "any controversy," and (b) whether smoking is a
condition of employment.5  See id.   
Although few cases explicitly address the "any
controversy" requirement by itself, it appears that the
requirement is satisfied in a broad range of labor disputes, not
only where there is picketing or a strike.  In AT&T Broadband,
LLC v. Int'l Bhd. of Elec. Workers, the United States Court of
Appeals of the Seventh Circuit held that a failure to negotiate
in good faith constituted a labor dispute.  317 F.3d 758, 759-61
(7th Cir. 2003).  Other courts using similar statutes have held
that labor disputes existed although no strike activity occurred,
where a disagreement led to litigation.  See, e.g., Milwaukee Bd.
of Sch. Directors v. Wis. Emp't Relations Comm'n, 472 N.W.2d 553,
557 (Wis. Ct. App. 1991); Marine Transp. Lines, Inc. v. Int'l
Org. of Masters, Mates & Pilots, 770 F.2d 1526, 1529-30 (11th
Cir. 1985).  In Univ. of Hawai #i Prof'l Assembly v. Tomasu, the
Hawai#i Supreme Court reviewed a dispute in which the parties
disagreed over whether the implementation of a statutory
requirement was a subject of mandatory bargaining.  79 Hawai #i
154, 156, 900 P.2d 161, 163 (1995).  The supreme court called
this situation a "labor dispute," although no picketing or strike
activity took place.  Id.  at 155, 900 P.2d at 162.  
Here, the situation is similar to that in Tomasu.  Id. 
This litigation arose from a disagreement over whether the
implementation of a statutory requirement was a mandatory subject
5We give the word "concerning" in HRS § 380-13(3) its common
meaning.
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
of bargaining.  Accordingly, even though no picketing or strike
activity took place, we conclude that the "any controversy"
requirement was satisfied.  Id.   
Tobacco use is generally construed to be a condition of
employment.  See Borough of Ellwood City v. Penn. Labor Relations
Bd., 998 A.2d 589, 599 (Pa. 2010) ("employee tobacco use at his
or her place of employment is germane to the employee's work
environment; thus, it is properly described as a working
condition"); Alberts, Inc. , 213 NLRB 686, 692-93 (1974) (deeming
a change in a smoking policy to have been a unilateral change in
working conditions).  
Here, as the controversy surrounds HHSC's changes to
its smoking policy, we conclude that it concerns the "condition
of employment" of HHSC's employees being able to smoke on HHSC's
premises.  See HRS § 380-13. 
Because both the "any controversy" and "condition of
employment" requirements were met, we further conclude that the
"labor dispute" requirement was met and this court has appellate
jurisdiction pursuant to HRS § 380-10.  
(2) Next, we consider whether this appeal is moot
because, on August 4, 2017, after this appeal was commenced, the
Circuit Court issued an order vacating partial stay, in which it
stated:  "Accordingly, the February 7, 2017 [Order Granting
Partial Stay] is hereby vacated."  UPW contends that the appeal
is not moot and that, even if it would otherwise be considered
moot, an exception to the mootness doctrine applies.
6NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
The mootness doctrine is said to encompass the circumstances
that destroy the justiciability of a suit previously
suitable for determination. Put another way, the suit must
remain alive throughout the course of litigation to the
moment of final appellate disposition. Its chief purpose is
to assure that the adversary system, once set in operation,
remains properly fueled. The doctrine seems appropriate
where events subsequent to the judgment of the trial court
have so affected the relations between the parties that the
two conditions for justiciability relevant on appeal—adverse
interest and effective remedy—have been compromised.
Hamilton ex rel. Lethem v. Lethem, 119 Hawai #i 1, 5, 193 P.3d
839, 843 (2008) (citations omitted).  
Here, the Circuit Court vacated the order being
appealed.  Therefore, no adverse interest or effective remedy
exists.  See id.  As to its first and second points of error,6
UPW argues that the issue of the applicability of HRS chapter 380
is not moot, because the case, which was remanded to HLRB, is
subject to another possible appeal, and HHSC could request future
similar injunctions.  However, the time to appeal HLRB's further
order, Order No. 3288, has passed.7  Therefore, we are not
6The issue of whether HRS § 380-1 barred an injunction underlies
UPW's first and second points of error.  
7On August 21, 2017, the HLRB entered Order No. 3288: Order
Amending Board Order No. 3199 by Responding to Questions Posed by the Circuit
Court on Remand, and Denying the UPW's Motion to Set Briefing Schedule to
Address Remanded Issues ( Order No. 3288 ).  With respect to the Circuit Court's
question regarding whether HHSC had a duty to negotiate with UPW "as to the
implementation and/or enforcement of Act 25," the HLRB responded:
The Board clarifies that Act 25 does not bar effects
bargaining.  It is a fundamental principle of collective
bargaining that although an employer is not required to
bargain over certain business decisions, the employer may
nevertheless have a duty to bargain about the effects of the
decision on its employees.  . . .
Here, Act 25 prohibits tobacco and electronic smoking
use, and thus the decision  to prohibit tobacco and
electronic smoking use is not negotiable; Act 25 provides
that "[p]ursuant to section 89-9(d), the tobacco and
electronic smoking device prohibitions  under this section
shall not be subject to collective bargaining" (emphasis
added).  However, Act 25 does not prohibit bargaining over
the effects of that law on wages, hours, or other terms or 
(continued...)

persuaded by UPW's argument.  This appeal is moot unless it is
saved by an exception.  
Regarding one such exception to the mootness doctrine,
the supreme court has stated:
"When analyzing the public interest exception, [this court]
look[s] to (1) the public or private nature of the question
presented, (2) the desirability of an authoritative
determination for future guidance of public officers, and
(3) the likelihood of future recurrence of the question."
Lethem, 119 Hawai# i at 6–7, 193 P.3d at 844–45 (quoting Doe v.
Doe, 116 Hawai #i 323, 327, 172 P.3d 1067, 1071 (2007)).  
 Here, as to UPW's first two points of error, the issue
of the applicability of HRS chapter 380 falls within these
parameters.  First, the issue potentially affects a "significant
number" of people.  See id., 119 Hawai# i at 7, 193 P.3d at 845. 
That is, whenever the Hawai# i Legislature passes a law that
affects unionized employees, and if one or more public employers
move for temporary injunctive relief related to the legislation,
the issue of whether HRS chapter 380 applies could affect a large
number of public employees, as well as members of the public that
are served by the public employees.  As to the second and third
factors, it would be desirable to obtain guidance for public
officers because it is likely that the Legislature will pass
another law affecting State employees, and a similar dispute is
likely to arise.  See Lethem, 119 Hawai #i at 6–7, 193 P.3d at
844–45 (citation omitted).  For these reasons, UPW's first and
7(...continued)
conditions of employment, and the wilfull failure to engage
in good faith effects bargaining may constitute a prohibited
practice.
(Emphasis added).  
8NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
second points of error fall within the public interest exception
to the mootness doctrine.  See id.  
UPW's third and fourth points of error allege that the
Circuit Court erred in determining that HHSC was likely to
prevail on the merits, in conjunction with its ruling on the
partial stay.  The question of which party will prevail on the
merits will be resolved in due course, with the disposition of
the merits of this case.  These questions would be more
appropriately considered in conjunction with an appeal from a
final order or judgment, if any, and it is not desirable to
review them prior to the final disposition by the trial court.
For these reasons, UPW's first and second points of
error are justiciable, but the third and fourth points are not.   
(3) In its first point of error, UPW contends that the
Circuit Court erred in determining that the appeal did not
involve a "labor dispute" pursuant to HRS chapter 380.8  HHSC
argues in response that the dispute at hand is a statutory
dispute, rather than a labor dispute, which it argues would
involve a strike or similar activity.  As discussed above, we
conclude that the instant appeal involves a labor dispute, and
therefore, HRS chapter 380 applies.  For this reason, we are
"left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has
been committed" and we hold that the Circuit Court erred when it
determined that the case did not involve a labor dispute.  Chun
8Apart from appellate jurisdiction, the issue of whether a "labor
dispute" was involved is significant because HRS chapter 380 limits the
Circuit Court's jurisdiction to issue injunctive relief in cases involving
"labor disputes," except in strict conformity with the requirements of HRS
chapter 380.  See HRS § 380-1.

v. Bd. of Trustees of Employees' Ret. Sys. Of State of Hawai #i,
416 106 Hawai# i 416, 430, 106 P.3d 339, 353 (citations omitted).
(4) UPW primarily contends that the Circuit Court
failed to comply with, inter alia, HRS § 380-7 (2015) before
granting the partial stay.9  HHSC contends that the Circuit Court
had the authority to issue the partial stay pursuant to HRS § 91-
14(c) (2012) and HRS § 377-9(h) (2015). 
Generally, Hawai #i's Norris-LaGuardia Act limits the
jurisdiction of the State courts to grant injunctive relief
in a "labor dispute" absent compliance with procedural
safeguards, including, inter alia , requirements with respect
to notice, hearing and findings of fact by the court.
McCabe Hamilton & Renny Co., Ltd. v. Chung, 98 Hawai# i 107,
112–13, 43 P.3d 244, 249–50 (App. 2002) (citing HRS §§ 380-1
(1993) and 380-7 (1993)).  
HRS § 380-1 (2015) provides that a court may not issue
an injunction in cases "involving or growing out of a labor
dispute" except "in strict conformity with [HRS chapter 380]." 
HRS § 380-7 requires that prior to issuing an injunction, the
court must hear "the testimony of witnesses" with "opportunity
for cross examination" and that it must also find: 
(1) That unlawful acts have been threatened and will be
committed unless restrained or have been committed and
will be continued unless restrained . . . .
(2) That substantial and irreparable injury to
complainant's property will follow;
(3) That as to each item of relief granted greater injury
will be inflicted upon complainant by the denial of
relief than will be inflicted upon defendants by the
granting of relief;
(4) That complainant has no adequate remedy at law; and
(5) That the public officers charged with the duty to protect
complainant's property are unable or unwilling to furnish
adequate protection.
9UPW also argues that the Circuit Court failed to follow HRS § 380-
9, but it does not appear that UPW made any arguments to the Circuit Court
regarding HRS § 380-9.  This argument is therefore waived. See Hawai #i Rules
of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(4)(b).
10NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
HRS § 380-7.  HRS § 380-7 further requires, inter alia , that
"complainant shall first file an undertaking with adequate
security in an amount to be fixed by the court[.]" 
Here, although the Circuit Court held a hearing on
January 12, 2017, it did not allow for the testimony and cross
examination of witnesses.  Nor did make the necessary findings,
nor require HHSC to post a bond.  We also note that certain types
of cases listed in HRS § 380-14 (2015 & Supp. 2017)10 are exempt
from the requirements of HRS chapter 380.  However, we agree with
UPW that these are inapplicable because these exceptions apply to
petitions for injunctive relief filed by the HLRB.  See  HRS
§ 380-14. 
Finally, we recognize that HRS § 377-9 and HRS chapter
380 might, at first blush, appear not to be in complete harmony
here.  HRS § 377-9(h) states that the "reviewing court may order
a stay upon such terms as it deems proper."  HRS § 380-1 states: 
No court of the State shall have jurisdiction to issue any
restraining order or temporary or permanent injunction in a
case involving or growing out of a labor dispute, except in
strict conformity with this chapter . . .
However, when HRS chapter 380 was enacted, both the
Senate and the House stated in their Standing Committee Reports: 
10HRS § 380-14 provides in relevant part:
§380-14 Proceedings arising under employment relations
act; court jurisdiction over.   (a) When granting appropriate
temporary relief or a restraining order . . . as provided in
this section, the jurisdiction of courts sitting in equity
shall not be limited by this chapter.
(b) The board shall have power. . . to petition
any circuit court of the State . . . for appropriate temporary
relief or restraining order. . . .
  (c) . . . If, after the investigation, the
board has reasonable cause to believe the charge is true, it
shall petition any circuit court of the State . . . for 
appropriate injunctive relief pending the final adjudication
of the board with respect to such matter.

"It should be pointed out that this bill [if] enacted will not be
in conflict with [HRS chapter 377]."  S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No.
709, in 1963 Senate Journal, at 909-10; H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No.
989, in 1963 House Journal, at 857.  Therefore, it was not the
intention of the Senate or the House that HRS chapter 380
override the court's jurisdiction to issue a stay of an HLRB
order pursuant to HRS § 377-9(h).  We conclude that it is
possible to give effect to both statutes because a circuit court
would have jurisdiction to grant a stay under HRS § 377-9(h), so
long as it complied with the requirements of HRS chapter 380, and
therefore no conflict exists.  See State v. Schnabel , 127 Hawai# i
432, 448, 279 P.3d 1237, 1253 (2012) (citation omitted). 
Therefore, having determined that (1) this case
involves or grows out of a labor dispute, and (2) the Circuit
Court failed to comply with the requirements of HRS § 380-7, we
conclude that the Circuit Court erred when it entered the
February 7, 2017 Order Granting Partial Stay.11
