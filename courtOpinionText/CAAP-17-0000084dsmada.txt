APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 17-1-0005)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL
 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, and Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that:
 
(1) On May 16, 2017, the court granted pro se 
Plaintiff-Appellant Richard Slezak's (Appellant) May 11, 2017 motion for relief from default of the record on appeal, and denied his motion for leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis without prejudice to him filing a motion, within ten days from the date of the order, that complies with Hawai
'i Rules 
of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 24(a) and provides all information prescribed by Form 4 of the Appendix of Forms. The court cautioned Appellant that failure to timely file the motion may result in the appeal being dismissed; NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2) On June 2, 2017, Appellant moved for
 
reconsideration of the May 16, 2017 order, and on June 13, 2017,
 
the court denied Appellant's motion;
 
(3) Appellant took no further action in this appeal;
 
and
 
(4) An appeal may be dismissed where the record on
 
appeal has not been prepared because the appellant failed to pay 
the required fees or obtain an order allowing the appellant to
 proceed in forma pauperis. HRAP Rule 11(b)(2) & (c)(2).
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed.
