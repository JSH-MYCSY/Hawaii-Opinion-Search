STATE OF HAWAI #I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
GARY J. FOUMAI, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CR. NO. 16-1-1538)
MEMORANDUM OPINION
(By:  Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Gary J. Foumai (Foumai) challenges
the imposition of restitution for his burglary conviction by the
Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court).1
I.
On September 28, 2016, in case number 1PC161001538,2 
Foumai was charged with Burglary in the Second Degree in
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 708-811 (2014)3 for
burglarizing a business office sometime between May 13, and
1The Honorable Dean E. Ochiai presided.
2During this proceeding, Foumai was also sentenced for various
other offenses in four other criminal cases.  None of those sentences are
involved in this appeal.
3HRS § 708-811 states:
§708-811  Burglary in the second degree.   (1)  A
person commits the offense of burglary in the second degree
if the person intentionally enters or remains unlawfully in
a building with intent to commit therein a crime against a
person or against property rights.
(2)  Burglary in the second degree is a class C
felony.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
May 14, 2015.  Foumai pleaded guilty to the charge,4  admitting
that he "entered Ian Mattoch's property . . . with the intent to
commit a property crime therein," and was sentenced to a four-
year term of probation.  At the hearing on Foumai's motion to
deny restitution, the State introduced by stipulation the police
department's closing report (Closing Report) regarding this
offense.
As summarized in the Closing Report,5 on May 13, 2015,
at approximately 6:00 p.m., when the last employee of The Offices
of Ian Mattoch left the office for the day, the doors were closed
and secured.  Another employee, who was the first to arrive at
the office at approximately 6:30 a.m. the following morning,
discovered that the desk drawers in Ian Mattoch's (Mattoch)
office were in the open position.  Mattoch reported to the police
that when he left his office for the day on May 13, 2015, his
desk drawers were closed, and when he returned on May 14, 2015,
they were open and "miscellaneous U.S. coins and paper currency"
were missing from the top drawer.  Other employees also submitted
statements to the police, reporting that, when they returned to
the office on the morning of May 14, 2015, they discovered an
Apple iPad, a First Hawaiian Bank credit card, an Apple iPhone, a
Cannon camera, and an Apple iPod missing from their respective
desks.
The Closing Report summarized the statement of still
another employee who identified the partially consumed bottle of
Pepsi found on the morning of May 14, 2015, on a co-worker's
desk, as the same one he had previously placed in the office
refrigerator.  As described in the Closing Report, the bottle was
recovered by police, a latent fingerprint taken from the bottle
was compared to "Live Scan" fingerprints taken from Foumai upon
his arrest, and a police fingerprint technician determined the
fingerprints matched.
4Foumai's plea was not pursuant to a plea agreement.  However, as
part of the change of plea colloquy, Foumai acknowledged that, as part of his
sentence the Circuit Court could also impose inter alia,  restitution.
5The Closing Report summarized the statements submitted to the
police.  The statements themselves were not included with the Closing Report.
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
At the restitution hearing, Foumai argued that "there
is no evidence at all that [Foumai] caused [Mattoch's] losses. 
There is simply no evidence that [Foumai] took the items listed
above."  The State argued that "[t]he stolen items that
constitute the complainant's loss in this case constitute the
very evidence that provides [] proof of the element of intent to
commit theft by defendant upon entry."  Foumai did not present
any exhibits, witnesses' testimony, or sworn statements.
The Circuit Court found "that the facts as set forth by
the State convinced the Court that in fact the defendant did
remove the articles complained of," and ordered restitution in
the amount of $1,679.74.  On January 24, 2017, the Circuit Court
entered an Amended Judgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence
which, among other things, ordered Foumai to pay restitution of
$1,679.74 to Mattoch.  This appeal followed.
II.
A.
Relying on State v. Domingo , 121 Hawai# i 191, 195, 216
P.3d 117, 121 (App. 2009), Foumai contends the Circuit Court
erred by imposing restitution because no "causal relationship"
was shown between the crime he was convicted of and the losses
claimed.  Foumai also argues that there was no evidence that
Foumai took any items during the burglary to which he pleaded
guilty.  In addition, citing Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466
(2000) and Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296 (2004), Foumai
claims the Circuit Court plainly erred by ordering restitution in
violation of his due process rights under the Sixth and
Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and
article I, sections 5, 8, and 14 of the Hawai #i Constitution
because it had "no supporting factual basis in the plea colloquy
and beyond the maximum sentence allowable (absent at least the
statutorily required 'verified loss')."
B.
HRS § 706-646(2) (2014) states in part, "[t]he court
shall order the defendant to make restitution for reasonable and
verified losses suffered by the victim or victims as a result of
the defendant's offense when requested by the victim."  Mattoch
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
and his employees requested restitution for items taken during
the charged period and submitted evidence of replacement value in
the total amount of $1,679.74.
In Phillips , the court stated:
HRS § 706–646 requires a court to order restitution
for "losses suffered by the victim or victims as a result of
the defendant's offense."  A party's conduct "is a legal
cause of harm to another if . . . his conduct is a
substantial factor in bringing about the harm."  Knodle v.
Waikiki Gateway Hotel, Inc., 69 Haw. 376, 390, 742 P.2d 377,
386 (1987) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts § 431 (Am.
Law. Inst. 1965)).  The conduct "need not have been the
whole cause or the only factor . . . bringing about the
. . . plaintiff’s injuries," id.  (quoting Mitchell v.
Branch, 45 Haw. 128, 132, 363 P.2d 969, 973 (1961)), but
some "nexus" is required in order to award restitution under
HRS § 706–646.  State v. Domingo , 121 Hawai #i 191, 195, 216
P.3d 117, 121 (App. 2009) (holding that where nexus was
lacking, restitution could not be imposed).
To determine whether a sufficient nexus exists for the
application of HRS § 706–646, a court must determine whether
the evidence supports a finding that the defendant's conduct
was the cause of or aggravated the victim's loss.  Id. at
195, 216 P.3d at 121 ("Absent evidence that [defendant's]
conduct caused or aggravated [victim's] injuries or caused
[victim's] death, no causal relationship between
[defendant's] criminal act and a victim's losses is shown
and restitution may not be imposed pursuant to HRS
§ 706–646.").
State v. Phillips , 138 Hawai# i 321, 352, 382 P.3d 133, 164
(2016).
The State bears the burden of establishing by a
preponderance of the evidence a causal connection between the
restitution requested and the crime with which the defendant is
charged.  State v. DeMello , 130 Hawai# i 332, 343, 310 P.3d 1033,
1044 (App. 2013) (DeMello I), reversed in part on other grounds
by State v. DeMello, 136 Hawai #i 193, 361 P.3d 420 (2015).  Here,
Foumai pleaded to entering the Mattoch office with the intent to
commit a crime against property rights between May 13 and 14,
2015.  At the hearing on restitution, the State presented the
Closing Report containing summaries of statements from each of
the owners or users of the property taken.  The State moved the
Closing Report into evidence and in response Foumai stipulated
the report into evidence.  As summarized, each of the owners
stated that when they returned to their desks on the morning of
May 14, 2015, their property was missing from their respective
desks.  The closing report also indicated that a fingerprint
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
recovered from a soda bottle on one of the desks match Foumai's
fingerprint.  Foumai presented no contrary evidence.  Based on
this record, a sufficient "causal relationship" or nexus between
the crime admitted by Foumai and the losses suffered was
established.
Foumai's argument that there was insufficient evidence
to prove he took the items claimed is also without merit.  While
it is true no direct evidence of theft was presented, direct
evidence is not necessary.  See State v. Murphy, 59 Haw. 1, 19,
575 P.2d 448, 460 (1978) ("it is elementary that a criminal case
may be proven beyond a reasonable doubt on the basis of
reasonable inferences drawn from circumstantial evidence.")
Here, the State made a prima facie showing.  See,
DeMello I , 130 Hawai #i at 344, 310 P.3d at 1045 ("where
restitution is contested, the burden to present a prima facie
showing . . . is best placed on the prosecution[.]") Foumai
stipulated to admission of the police closing report during the
restitution hearing.  Although Foumai appears to argue on appeal
that the Circuit Court relied on inadmissible evidence, he did
not object below, instead stipulated the report be received into
evidence and thus waived any challenge to this evidence.  See
State v. Naole, 62 Haw. 563, 570-71, 617 P.2d 820,826 (1980). 
The closing report contained a summary of a statement by Employee
#2, in which the employee related that he was the only person in
the office that drinks Pepsi, his partially consumed Pepsi bottle
was no longer in the refrigerator where he had previously placed
it but rather it was found on the desk of a co-worker and
appeared to have been consumed by someone.  The co-worker upon
whose desk the soda bottle was found stated the bottle was not on
her desk when she left the office on May 13, 2015.  Foumai's
fingerprints were matched to fingerprints found on the Pepsi
bottle.  According to the statements of various other employees,
an iPhone, camera, iPod, and money were missing from their desks. 
Although the missing items were not found, the foregoing leads to
a reasonable inference that Foumai took the missing items during
the commission of a burglary.
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Once the State made a prima facie showing, the burden
shifted to Foumai to rebut the evidence.  Demello I, 130 Hawai# i
at 344, 310 P.3d at 1045.  Foumai did not testify and did not
offer any evidence; he merely argued that the State's evidence
was insufficient.  In the absence of contrary evidence, the
State's showing was sufficient to support the Circuit court's
finding that Foumai "did remove the articles complained of."  
See DeLong v. State , 638 So.2d 1054, 1055 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App.
1994) (restitution based on testimony presented by the State that
the victim's property was in the vehicle when it was stolen and
not found in the vehicle when it was recovered a few hours later
and the lack of testimony by DeLong that the items "were not in
the vehicle when he took possession of the car.").
C.
Foumai's argument that imposition of restitution in
this case was a violation of his due process rights is also
without merit.  In Apprendi, "[t]he question presented [wa]s
whether the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
requires that a determination authorizing an increase in the
maximum prison sentence for an offense from 10 to 20 years be
made by a jury on the basis of proof beyond a reasonable doubt." 
Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 469.  The Apprendi  court did not address
whether imposition of restitution requires the question to be
placed before a jury.
Foumai presents no other authority mandating such a
result.  To the contrary, the federal circuit courts have held
that Apprendi and its progeny do not apply to restitution under
federal statutes, as they do not depend upon any fact "that
increases the maximum penalty" because there is no statutory
limit to the amount of restitution that may be imposed.  United
States v. Milkiewicz, 470 F.3d 390, 403-04 (1st Cir. 2006)
(noting that "nine other circuits already have held that judicial
fact-finding on restitution is permissible under [ United States
v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005)]"); United States v. Day , 700 F.3d
713, 732 (4th Cir. 2012).
In addition, many state courts have found that Apprendi
does not apply to an order of restitution for the same reason.
