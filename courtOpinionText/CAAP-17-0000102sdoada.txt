2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 raised and the arguments advanced by the parties, we resolve the 
appeal as follows. 
I. Background 
In 1995, Wayne and Coleen Tom (Toms) executed and 
delivered a promissory note (Note) for $160,000.00 to Western 
Pacific Mortgage, Inc. to purchase property in Kapolei 
(Property).  The Note was secured by a mortgage (Mortgage) in 
favor of Western Pacific Mortgage, Inc.  The Property was 
subsequently conveyed to Unciano by warranty deed.  Since 1995, the Note and Mortgage were purportedly transferred and assigned several times.  Pertinent to this appeal, in 2003, Washington Mutual Bank, FA (Washington Mutual) filed a foreclosure complaint 
(2003 Complaint), attaching a copy of the Note.  In 2010, Homecomings Financial assigned the Mortgage "together with the 
note or notes therein described" to the Plaintiff-Appellee GMAC Mortgage, LLC (GMAC), who then successfully foreclosed on the 
Property. 
On appeal to this Court, we explained that "Unciano's 
primary argument underlying all her consolidated appeals is that 
[GMAC] did not establish that, and there were genuine issues of material fact concerning whether, GMAC was the valid holder of the note and mortgage on which the foreclosure action regarding the subject property is based."  GMAC Mortg., LLC v. Unciano, 133 Hawai# i 449, 329 P.3d 354, CAAP-11-0001081, CAAP-13-0000306, 
CAAP-13-0001307, 2014 WL 2949441, at *1 (App. Jun. 30, 2014) (SDO).  "We conclude[d] that there were genuine issues of material fact regarding whether GMAC was the valid holder of the note and mortgage on the subject property."  Id. We also 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 concluded that "GMAC lack[ed] standing to pursue the Foreclosure 
Action unless GMAC can show that it [was] the owner of the Mortgage."  Id. at *4.  We then "vacate[d] the Foreclosure Judgment, Confirmation of Sale Judgment, Judgment for Possession, and Order Denying Land Court Petition, and remand[ed] for further proceedings."  Id. at *1. 
On remand to the Circuit Court, GMAC moved to reinstate 
the vacated orders and judgment on February 24, 2016 (2016 Motion 
to Reinstate), and submitted the declaration of Chris Eggert of 21st Mortgage Corporation—the current servicer of the Note and 
Mortgage.  GMAC also submitted public records from Delaware and Minnesota that purported to clarify the issues addressed in this Court's 2014 decision.  The Circuit Court held a hearing on the Motion to Reinstate where GMAC presented the original Note with endorsements and allonges for inspection.  The Circuit Court ultimately granted the 2016 Motion to Reinstate. 
In response, Unciano filed multiple motions including 
(1) an Ex Parte Motion to Correct Court Record Regarding Hearing Held on July 26, 2016, Re: Plaintiff's Motion to Reinstate Vacated Orders and Judgments filed 2/24/16; (2) an amended motion of the same; and (3) a motion for a new trial.  In her motion for new trial, Unciano argued that "GMAC lack[ed] standing to proceed without reinstatement of Land Court Order 186175."  The Circuit Court denied these motions. 
On February 24, 2017, Unciano filed her notice of 
appeal with this Court.  Four days later, the Hawai# i Supreme 
Court published its opinion in Bank of America, N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai# i 361, 390 P.3d 1248 (2017).  In her opening 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
brief to this Court, Unciano again contends that GMAC lacks 
standing, but relies on the Hawai# i Supreme Court's holding in 
Reyes-Toledo to support her contention.  In its answering brief, GMAC argues, among other things, that Unciano lacks standing to challenge the Note, this court's only instruction on remand was "concerning the assignment of the Mortgage, not the Note," and its standing to enforce the Note "withstands scrutiny under" Reyes-Toledo. 
II. Discussion 
A. Unciano Has Standing 
Contrary to GMAC's contention that Unciano lacks 
standing to object to the foreclosure action because Unciano is not a party to the Note and cannot avail herself of the rights under the contract, Unciano has standing.  The Hawai# i Supreme 
Court observed that standing in the foreclosure context did not implicate the same standing requirements as contract law.  See Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Behrendt, 142 Hawai# i 37, 41–42, 414 
P.3d 89, 93–94 (2018) ("This court's reasoning in Reyes-Toledo, however, was based on standing and the statutory foreclosure requirements and was not tied to the contractual relationship between the parties.")  In Behrendt, the foreclosing bank argued that the defendant "was not a party to the Mortgage and because there is no reasonable interpretation of the Mortgage that confers contractual rights, obligations, and standing on [the defendant] or upon any subsequent purchaser who does not assume the Mortgage, [the defendant] could not 'seek protection' under the Mortgage."  Id. at 41, 414 P.3d at 93 (emphasis added).  The Court, however, observed that the purpose of ensuring the 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
foreclosing plaintiff has standing is to protect the maker of the 
note from multiple enforcement of the same note and to protect the homeowner from an improper foreclosure.  See id. at 42, 414 P.3d at 94.  Therefore, a subsequent purchaser may challenge the validity of a foreclosure action.  See id. 
The Property was conveyed to Unciano by warranty deed 
from the Toms for $125.00 in gold.  The warranty deed transferred all rights, title, interests, and claims the Toms had in the Property.  Thus, Unciano was a subsequent purchaser who had standing to challenge the foreclosure action.  See id. at 42, 414 P.3d at 94. 
B. A Genuine Issue Of Material Fact Exists 
As she did in the first appeal and on remand, Unciano 
challenges GMAC's standing.  Relying on Reyes-Toledo, Unciano 
contends that the Circuit Court committed reversible error in granting summary judgment in favor of GMAC because GMAC lacked standing to foreclose on the Property. 
In Reyes-Toledo, the bank filed a complaint to 
foreclose on the homeowner's property.  Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai# i 
at 364, 390 P.3d at 1251.  The homeowner asserted many defenses including that the bank was not the holder of the mortgage and note.  Id. The bank later moved for summary judgment, which was 
granted, and the circuit court entered an Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure as a final judgment pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b).  Id. at 365-66, 390 P.3d at 1252-53. 
On certiorari review, the Hawai# i Supreme Court 
explained that "[i]n order to prove entitlement to foreclose, the foreclosing party must demonstrate that all conditions precedent 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to foreclosure under the note and mortgage are satisfied and that 
all steps required by statute have been strictly complied with[,]" including proving "its entitlement to enforce the note and mortgage."  Id. at 367, 390 P.3d at 1254.  "A foreclosing plaintiff's burden to prove entitlement to enforce the note overlaps with the requirements of standing in foreclosure actions as standing is concerned with whether the parties have the right to bring suit."  Id. (citation omitted and cleaned up). 
Because the bank moved for summary judgment, it was the 
bank's burden to show that there were no genuine issues of material fact regarding the essential elements of a foreclosure action.  Id. at 370, 390 P.3d at 1257.  More specifically, "standing must be present at the commencement of the case. . . . [A] foreclosing plaintiff must establish entitlement to enforce the note at the time the action was commenced[.]"  Id. at 368, 390 P.3d at 1255 (emphasis added).  The Hawai# i Supreme Court 
held that the bank failed to meet its burden because there was no evidence in the record showing that "the blank indorsement on the Note occurred prior to the initiation of the suit."  Id. at 371, 390 P.3d at 1258. 
Like the homeowner in Reyes-Toledo, Unciano challenged 
whether GMAC was the holder of the note and mortgage and, thus, challenged GMAC's standing.  Standing "arises solely out of justiciability concerns based on prudential concerns of judicial self-governance, and is based on concern about the proper--and properly limited--role of courts in a democratic society[,]" and asks whether the litigant is asserting a legally recognized interest that is personal and peculiar to him.  See Tax Found. of 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawai# i v. State, 144 Hawai# i 175, 191-92, 439 P.3d 127, 143-44 
(2019) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Accordingly, standing 
may be raised at any time, and "
Hawai# i State Courts may consider 
standing even when not raised by the parties."  Id.
; see Mortgage 
Elec. Registration Sys., Inc. v. Wise, 130 Hawai# i 11, 17, 304 
P.3d 1192, 1198 (2013), as amended (July 10, 2013).3  Here, 
Unciano consistently challenged GMAC's standing, albeit for different reasons. 
In addition, as the Hawai# i Supreme Court explained in 
Reyes-Toledo, the "requirement that a foreclosing plaintiff prove its entitlement to enforce the note at the commencement of the proceedings provides strong and necessary incentives to help ensure that the note holder will not proceed with a foreclosure action before confirming that it has a right to do so."  Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai# i at 369, 390 P.3d at 1256 (emphasis added and 
internal quotation marks omitted). 
Because standing may be considered at any time, Unciano 
consistently challenged GMAC's standing, and Reyes-Toledo is binding on this Court, we address whether there were genuine issues of material fact as to Washington Mutual's standing to foreclose at the time this action was originally filed and, by extension, GMAC's standing as a substituted party.  And for summary judgment purposes, we must view the evidence, and 
3  In Wise , the defendants appealed from the judgment confirming the
foreclosure sale, challenging the plaintiff's standing to foreclose.  The 
Hawai #i Supreme Court noted that although lack of standing can be raised at
any time, the defendants' challenge to standing was barred by res judicata
because the defendants did not raise standing in opposition to the foreclosureor appeal the foreclosure judgment.  
Wise
, 130 Hawai #i at 17, 304 P.3d at 
1198.  In this case, Unciano appealed from, among other things, theforeclosure judgment and, thus, res judicata does not bar her challenge toWashington Mutual's standing when the 2003 Complaint was filed. 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, in the light most 
favorable to Unciano, the non-moving party.  See Hawaii Cmty. Fed. Credit Union v. Keka, 94 Hawai# i 213, 221, 11 P.3d 1, 9 
(2000). 
The 2003 Complaint alleged that Washington Mutual was 
the owner and holder of the Note by mesne assignment.  A copy of the Note, without indorsements, allonges, or bleed-through markings, was attached to the 2003 Complaint. 
In stark contrast, at the 2016 Motion to Reinstate 
hearing, GMAC produced the original Note that showed bleed through and included several allonges with undated special indorsement to various entities purportedly made before a blank endorsement by Residential Funding Company, LLC. 
GMAC asserts that the Note was assigned from Western 
Pacific to Mellon Mortgage Company in 1995, and then to Fleet Real Estate in 1996, which ultimately became known as Washington Mutual.  GMAC points to the indorsements on the Note produced at the 2016 hearing as evidence those assignments were made prior to the 2003 Complaint. 
However, the three undated indorsements (two of which 
bled through to the reverse page) and the undated allonges presented at the 2016 hearing were not visible on, and not included with, the Note attached to the 2003 Complaint.
4  That 
the indorsements were readily visible on the Note produced at the 2016 hearing but not visible on the Note attached to the 2003 
4  Similarly, the bleed through was not visible, and the undated
allonges were not included with, the Note attached to GMAC's Plaintiff's
Motion [1] To Substitute Party and Amend Caption, and [2] For Summary Judgmentand Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure, filed in 2011. 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Complaint raises a genuine issue of material fact as to whether 
Washington Mutual had possession of the Note at the time it filed the 2003 Complaint.  The allonges included with the Note produced at the 2016 hearing but not included with the Note attached to the 2003 Complaint raise a similar issue of material fact. 
Furthermore, because the indorsements and allonges 
provided at the 2016 hearing were undated, it is unclear that Washington Mutual was entitled to foreclose at the time it filed the 2003 Complaint.  Although GMAC points to several recorded assignments of the Mortgage, that evidence was not dispositive because the debt does not automatically follow the security.  See Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai# i at 371 n.17, 390 P.3d at 1258 n.17 
("Although the security follows the debt, the debt does not automatically follow the security."). 
Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to 
Unciano, there are genuine issues as to whether Washington Mutual was entitled to enforce the Note at the time it filed the 2003 Complaint, and whether GMAC as the substitute plaintiff was entitled to foreclose on the Property.  See Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai# i at 370, 390 P.3d at 1257; Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. 
Pierce, 144 Hawai# i 436, 443 P.3d 128, CAAP-17-0000553, 2019 WL 
2723641 at *2 (App. Jun. 28, 2019) (SDO) ("The blank indorsement on the Note is undated and there is no evidence when the blank indorsement was made.  Thus, it is unclear at what point the Note could have been negotiated by transfer of possession alone."). 
"The requirement that a foreclosing plaintiff prove its 
entitlement to enforce the note at the commencement of the proceedings provides strong and necessary incentives to help 
10 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
ensure that a note holder will not proceed with a foreclosure 
action before confirming that it has a right to do so."  Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai# i at 369, 390 P.3d at 1256 (citation and 
internal quotation marks omitted).  On remand, "the foreclosing party must demonstrate that all conditions precedent to foreclosure under the note and mortgage are satisfied and that all steps required by statute have been strictly complied with[,]" including proving "its entitlement to enforce the note and mortgage[,]" and the original plaintiff's standing to foreclose when the complaint was filed.  Id. at 367-68, 390 P.3d at 1254-55.  In light of our resolution, we need not reach Unciano's remaining contentions. 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the Circuit 
Court's November 1, 2017 Second Amended Final Judgment and January 27, 2017 Order Denying Unciano's HRCP Rule 59 Motion for New Trials, Amendment of Judgments, Etc., and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this summary disposition order.
