(2) On March 16, 2017, the Chief Clerk of the Labor and
 
Industrial Relations Appeals Board notified Appellant that the
 clerk is not required to prepare the record on appeal until
 Appellant paid the required fees or obtained an order allowing
 her to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis;

Industrial Relations Appeals Board or this court a motion for leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis. See Hawai

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 24(a);
 
(4) On May 2, 2017, the appellate clerk notified
 
Appellant that the time to docket the record on appeal expired on
 
April 28, 2017, the filing and docketing fees had not been paid,
 the record on appeal cannot be prepared without the fees or an
 order authorizing Appellant to proceed on appeal in forma
 pauperis, the matter would be called to the court's attention on
 May 12, 2017, for action that may include dismissal, and
 Appellant may file a motion requesting relief from default;
 
(5) Appellant did not pay the filing fees, or take any
 
further action in this appeal; and
 
(6) An appeal may be dismissed where the record on
 
appeal has not been prepared because the appellant failed to pay 
the required fees or obtain an order allowing the appellant to
 proceed in forma pauperis. HRAP Rule 11(b)(2) & (c)(2).
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed. 
Dated: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, May 26, 2017.
