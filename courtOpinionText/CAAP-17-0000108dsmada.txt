MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL AS MOOT
 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Reifurth and Chan, JJ.)
 Defendant-Appellee Maunalua Fishpond Heritage Center 
(MFHC) filed a Motion to Dismiss Appeal as Moot (Motion) on
 
August 6, 2018. On August 7, 2018, Defendant-Appellee The Trust
 
for Public Land (TPL) and Defendants-Appellees Board of Land and
 
Natural Resources, Suzanne Case, in her official capacity as
 
Chairperson of the Board of Land and Natural Resources (BLNR) and
 
the Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR), filed
 
joinders in the Motion. Plaintiff-Appellant Richard MacDonald
 
(MacDonald) has not filed any response or opposition to the
 
Motion.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
This matter involves the BLNR's decision to approve a
 
grant of public funds to the MFHC and the TPL to acquire the
 
Kânewai Spring Property in East Honolulu (Kâ newai Spring). The
 
material facts are not in dispute. The Kânewai Spring features
 an open freshwater spring that flows into the ocean and into an
 ancient Hawaiian fishpond (Kânewai Fishpond).  The Kânewai
 
Fishpond is privately owned with surrounding property owners
 
holding an undivided interest in the fishpond. 
MacDonald is one of the two members of Kalanianaole 
Highway LLC, which owns residential real property located at 6015-B Kalaniana' ole Highway, Kuli' ou'ou, Honolulu, Hawai' i 
(Kalaniana' ole Property). The Kalaniana' ole Property is on the 
Kânewai Fishpond and includes an undivided ownership interest in the Kânewai Fishpond along with other neighboring properties. 
On appeal, MacDonald contends that the Circuit Court of
 
the First Circuit (circuit court) erred in dismissing his First
 
Amended Complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. 
MacDonald's challenge arises from his status as a 
member of Kalanianaole Highway LLC and its ownership of the 
Kalaniana' ole Property. However, it appears that Kalanianaole 
Highway LLC sold the Kalaniana' ole Property by way of a Warranty 
Deed dated April 17, 2018 during the pendency of this appeal. The conveyance appears to have eliminated the purported basis for MacDonald's alleged standing under the Hawai' i Environment Policy 
Act (HEPA). 
With regard to mootness, the Hawai' i Supreme Court has 
stated: 
[A] case is moot where the question to be determined is
abstract and does not rest on existing facts or rights.
Thus, the mootness doctrine is properly invoked where events
have so affected the relations between the parties that the
two conditions of justiciability relevant on appeal—adverse
interest and effective remedy—have been compromised.

Bank of New York Mellon v. R. Onaga, Inc., 140 Hawai' i 358, 365, 
400 P.3d 559, 566 (2017) (citation, internal quotation marks and 
brackets omitted). 
To determine standing, we employ a three-part test, 
requiring that the plaintiff satisfy the following: "(1) has the plaintiff suffered an actual or threatened injury . . . ; (2) is the injury fairly traceable to the defendant's actions; and (3) would a favorable decision likely provide relief for plaintiff's injury." Sierra Club v. Dep't of Transp., 115 Hawai' i 299, 319, 
167 P.3d 292, 312 (2007) (Sierra Club) (footnote, citations, and 
brackets omitted). 
In this case, MacDonald argued that he suffered a
 
procedural injury under HEPA. To establish a procedural injury,
 
a plaintiff must show that: 
(1) the plaintiff has been accorded a procedural right,
which was violated in some way, e.g., as here, a failure to
conduct an EA; (2) the procedural right protects the
plaintiff's concrete interests; and (3) the procedural
violation threatens the plaintiff's concrete interests, thus
affecting the plaintiff "personally," which may be
demonstrated by showing (a) a "geographic nexus" to the site
in question and (b) that the procedural violation increases
the risk of harm to the plaintiff's concrete interests.
 
Sierra Club, 115 Hawai' i at 329, 167 P.3d at 322 (citation and 
footnote omitted). 
On appeal, the parties dispute whether the circuit
 
court erred in dismissing MacDonald's First Amended Complaint
 
based on standing. In opposition to MFHC and TPL's summary
 judgment motion in the Circuit Court, MacDonald provided in his
 declaration that he is "one of two member-managers of
 Kalanianaole Highway, LLC, that owns residential property located
 at 6015-B Kalanianaole Highway, Kuliouou, Honolulu, Hawaii, 96821
 . . . My wife, Claire MacDonald, is the other member-manager of
 Kalanianaole Highway LLC." MacDonald further attested that
 "6015-B Kalanianaole is on the privately owned Kanewai Fishpond
 and includes an undivided ownership interest in the Kanewai
 Fishpond along with the other neighboring properties on the
 Kanewai Fishpond."

In the instant case, the record supports MFHC's
 
assertion that Kalanianaole Highway LLC has conveyed the subject 
property via which MacDonald claims standing. Specifically, in the Warranty Deed attached to the Motion, Kalanianaole Highway LLC transfers certain property, including Tax Map Key 3-8-002­036, which is the same property through which MacDonald claims an interest in this case. The record is devoid of any additional basis for MacDonald to assert standing in this case. MacDonald requests on appeal that we reverse the circuit court's dismissal based on standing and remand the case to the circuit court. However, given that the basis for MacDonald's alleged standing under HEPA is no longer present, because MacDonald does not hold any interest in the Kalaniana' ole Property, no effective relief 
in this appeal can be granted and thus MacDonald's appeal is moot. 
Moreover, exceptions to the mootness doctrine are not 
applicable in this instance. Hamilton ex rel. Lethem v. Lethem, 
119 Hawai' i 1, 5, 193 P.3d 839, 843 (2008). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Maunalua Fishpond
 
Heritage Center's August 6, 2018 motion to dismiss appellate
 court case number CAAP-17-0000108 as moot is granted, and this
 appeal is dismissed.
