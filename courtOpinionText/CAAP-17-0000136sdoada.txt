IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI #I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
SERGIO A. VASQUEZ, JR., Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CASE NO. 1DTA-16-02669)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, and Reifurth and Chan, JJ.)
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai# i charged Defendant-
Appellant Sergio A. Vasquez, Jr. by complaint with (1) operating
a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant ("OVUII"), in
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") section 291E-
61(a)(1) and/or (a)(3) (Supp. 2015); and (2) driving without
motor vehicle insurance, in violation of HRS section 431:10C-
104(a) (2005).  The District Court of the First Circuit
("District Court")1/ dismissed the complaint without prejudice
for violation of the speedy trial time limits set forth in
Hawai#i Rules of Penal Procedure ("HRPP") Rule 48.  HRPP Rule
48(b) provides: "Except in the case of traffic offenses that are
not punishable by imprisonment, the court shall, on motion of the
defendant, dismiss the charge, with or without prejudice in its
discretion, if trial is not commenced within 6 months[.]"  The
District Court filed its Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order
and Plea/Judgment ("Judgment") on February 7, 2017 . 
1/The Honorable Philip M. Doi presided.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
On appeal, Vasquez argues that the District Court (1)
erred in dismissing the OVUII charge without prejudice because it
failed to consider the factors outlined by the Hawai# i Supreme
Court in State v. Estencion, 63 Haw. 264, 625 P.2d 1040 (1981);2/
and (2) erred in dismissing the OVUII charge without prejudice,
rather than with prejudice.3/  We apply State v. Hern, 133 Hawai #i
59, 323 P.3d 1241 (App. 2013), in resolving Vasquez's arguments.
In Hern, this court held that "in determining whether
to dismiss a charge with or without prejudice under HRPP Rule
48(b), the trial court must not only consider the Estencion
factors, but must also clearly articulate the effect of the
Estencion  factors and any other factor it considered in rendering
its decision."  Hern , 133 Hawai #i at 64, 323 P.3d at 1246.  Here,
the only basis provided by the District Court for dismissing the
OVUII charge without prejudice rather than with prejudice was:
"this entire category of [OVUII] cases is a -- is a -- a very, in
my opinion, serious matter.  So dismissal will be without
prejudice."   
In rendering its decision, the District Court only
referred to the first Estencion  factor; it did not mention, much
less clearly articulate the effect of, the second and third
Estencion factors.  The District Court therefore failed to comply
with the Hern requirements in rendering its decision.  We also
conclude that the record is not sufficient for this court to
2/The "Estencion  factors" are: "'[(1)] the seriousness of the
offense; [(2)] the facts and the circumstances of the case which led to the
dismissal; and [(3)] the impact of a reprosecution on the administration of
[HRPP Rule 48] and on the administration of justice[.]'"  State v. Hern , 133
Hawai#i 59, 60, 323 P.3d 1241, 1242 (App. 2013) (some brackets in original)
(quoting Estencion , 63 Haw. at 269, 625 P.2d at 1044).
3/The District Court dismissed both the OVUII charge and the driving
without motor vehicle insurance charge without prejudice pursuant to HRPP Rule
48.  However, Vasquez was charged with driving without motor vehicle insurance
as a first offender, which is a traffic offense that is not punishable by
imprisonment.  See Haw. Rev. Stat. ยง 431:10C-104(c); Haw. Rev. Stat. ยง
431:10C-117(a) (Supp. 2015).  Therefore, it appears that the charge against
Vasquez for driving without motor vehicle insurance was exempt from the speedy
trial requirements of HRPP Rule 48 and that the District Court erred in
relying on HRPP Rule 48 in dismissing that charge.  See Haw. R. Pen. P. 48(b);
State v. Mageo , 78 Hawai #i 33, 35-36, 889 P.2d 1092, 1094-95 (App. 1995). 
Neither party appealed from the dismissal of the driving without insurance
charge.  In fact, Vasquez's arguments on appeal are based on HRPP Rule 48 and
focus on the OVUII charge.  Accordingly, we will not address or further
discuss the District Court's dismissal of the driving without motor vehicle
insurance charge.

determine whether the District Court abused its discretion in
dismissing the OVUII charge without prejudice.4/  
Accordingly, we vacate the District Court's Judgment
with respect to the OVUII charge, and we remand the case with
instructions that the District Court: (1) consider the Estencion
factors in determining whether to dismiss Vasquez's OVUII charge
with or without prejudice; and (2) make findings that clearly
articulate the effect of the Estencion  factors and any other
factor it considered in rendering its decision.

4/In this regard, we note that Vasquez argues that because OVUII is
a petty misdemeanor, "OVUII cases are not serious as a matter of law."
However, in State v. Fukuoka , 141 Hawai #i 48, 56-59, 404 P.3d 314, 322-25
(2017), the Hawai #i Supreme Court concluded that petty misdemeanor offenses
should not as a categorical rule be viewed as non-serious offenses for
purposes of the first Estencion  factor, and that the District Court should
conduct a particularized inquiry in considering the seriousness of an offense.
