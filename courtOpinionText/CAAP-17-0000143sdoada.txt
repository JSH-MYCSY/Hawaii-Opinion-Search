LARINA M.K. BENITEZ, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CASE NO. 1DTC-16-070804)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Larina M.K. Benitez ( Benitez)
appeals from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and
Plea/Judgment, filed on February 14, 2017, in the District Court
of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division ( District Court ).1 
Benitez was convicted of Operating a Vehicle After License and
Privilege have been Suspended or Revoked for Operating a Vehicle
Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVLPSR-OVUII ), in violation
1 The Honorable Linda K.C. Luke presided.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS ) § 291E-62(a) (Supp. 2017),2 for
an incident that occurred on August 8, 2016.
On appeal, Benitez contends there was insufficient
evidence to convict her because the State failed to prove she
acted recklessly or disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that her license was revoked when she drove on August 8,
2016. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve Benitez's point of error as follows:
Benitez claims that there was insufficient proof to
demonstrate the requisite intent to commit the offense of OVLPSR-
OVUII because she had no notice that her license was suspended or
revoked on August 8, 2016.  Benitez does not dispute that on
2 HRS § 291E-62(a) states:
§ 291E-62  Operating a vehicle after license and
privilege have been suspended or revoked for operating a
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant; penalties. 
(a)  No person whose license and privilege to operate a
vehicle have been revoked, suspended, or otherwise
restricted pursuant to this section or to part III or
section 291E-61 or 291E-61.5, or to part VII or part XIV of
chapter 286 or section 200-81, 291-4, 291-4.4, 291-4.5, or
291-7 as those provisions were in effect on December 31,
2001, shall operate or assume actual physical control of any
vehicle:
(1) In violation of any restrictions placed on the
person's license;
(2)  While the person's license or privilege to
operate a vehicle remains suspended or revoked;
(3)  Without installing an ignition interlock device
required by this chapter; or
(4)  With an ignition interlock permit unless the
person has the ignition interlock permit and a
valid State of Hawaii identification card in the
person's immediate possession.
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
August 8, 2016, she operated or assumed actual physical control
of a vehicle, on a public way, street, road, or highway, in the
City and County of Honolulu, State of Hawai# i.  Benitez also does
not dispute that her license was actually suspended or revoked on
August 8, 2016.  In addition, on July 16, 2016, Benitez was
informed of, and signed, a Notice of Administrative Revocation
after she was arrested for Operating a Vehicle Under the
Influence of an Intoxicant, in violation of HRS § 291E-61 (Supp.
2017). 
When the evidence adduced at trial is considered in the
strongest light for the prosecution, with all reasonable and
rational inferences under the facts in evidence, including
circumstantial evidence, State v. Matavale, 115 Hawai# i 149, 157-
58, 166 P.3d 322, 330-31 (2007), there was substantial evidence
to support Benitez's conviction. 
Even assuming that the State failed to demonstrate
Benitez had notice of her license revocation from an incorrectly
mailed September 25, 2016 Notice of Administrative Hearing
Decision, there was sufficient evidence to show Benitez
consciously disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
her license was revoked on August 8, 2016.
Pursuant to HRS § 291E-37 (Supp. 2017), the Director of
the Administrative Driver's License Revocation Office must "issue
a written decision administratively revoking the license and
privilege to operate a vehicle or rescinding the notice of
administrative revocation."  HRS § 291E-37(a).  "If the evidence
does not support administrative revocation, the director shall
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
rescind the notice of administrative revocation and return the
respondent's license along with a certified statement that
administrative revocation proceedings have been terminated."  HRS
§ 291E-37(e).  "If the director administratively revokes the
respondent's license and privilege to operate a vehicle, the
director shall mail a written review decision to the respondent,
or to the parent or guardian of the respondent if the respondent
is under the age of eighteen."  HRS § 291E-37(f).  
If the Notice of Administrative Revocation issued to
Benitez on July 16, 2016, was rescinded after an administrative
review, Benitez's license would have been returned to her, and
she could not request an administrative hearing because HRS
§ 291E-38 (Supp. 2017) does not allow a respondent to request an
administrative hearing unless a license has been revoked.  It
appears from the record,3 however, that Benitez received the
Administrative Review Decision that revoked her license because
she requested an administrative hearing, and a request for a
hearing can only be made after an Administrative Review Decision
is issued that revoked a license.  See HRS § 291E-38(a).  Thus,
Benitez was aware that her license was revoked when she requested
an administrative hearing.  Benitez consciously disregarded the
substantial and unjustifiable risk regarding the time period that
3A notation on a September 25, 2016 Notice of Administrative
Hearing Decision states "Prior to commencement of the hearing set for 9/24/15
Respondent, through and as approved by Counsel, withdrew her request for a
hearing.  See, Withdrawal dated 9/24/2015.  Therefore the Notice of
Administrative Review Decision dated 7/23/15 is affirmed in part and amended
to reflect the extension of Respondent's temporary permit from 8/16/15 through
9/24/15.  The amended revocation period is 8/16/15 through 9/23/16 excluding
the period during which Respondent enjoyed driving privileges due to the
extension of her pe[rmit]." 
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
her license was revoked after being notified that her license was
revoked.  Therefore, there was substantial evidence to support
Benitez's conviction.
Accordingly, the District Court's February 14, 2017
Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment is
affirmed.
