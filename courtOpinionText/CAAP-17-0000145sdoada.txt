On appeal, the Malabes assert eight points of error,2
 
contending that the Circuit Court erred in granting the motion to
 
dismiss (1) as to the wrongful foreclosure claim, by failing to
 rule against the AOAO for various violations of statutory and
 procedural requirements in the 2010 Foreclosure Act, and (2) as
 to the Malabes' claims for unfair or deceptive acts or practices
 (UDAP), by failing to recognize the Malabes's standing to bring
 
the action as well as their compliance with the statute of
 
limitations. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve the Malabes' points of error as follows:
 
(1) The Malabes assert that the Circuit Court erred in
 
failing to recognize the validity of their claim that the AOAO
 unlawfully invoked Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 667-5 (Supp.
 
2010) (repealed 2012)
3 in conducting a nonjudicial foreclosure on
 
2 Although the Malabes identify eight separate points of error,
their argument is structured, and can be fairly addressed, in accordance with
the two points outlined above. 
3 The applicable enactment of HRS § 667-5 (amended in 2011 and
repealed 2012) stated, in relevant part:
 
§ 667-5 Foreclosure under power of sale; notice;
affidavit after sale. (a) When a power of sale is contained
in a mortgage, and where . . . any person authorized by the
power to act in the premises, desires to foreclose under
power of sale upon breach of a condition of the mortgage,
the . . . person shall be represented by an attorney who is
licensed to practice law in the State and is physically
located in the State. The attorney shall:
(1)	 Give notice of the . . . person's intention to
foreclose the mortgage and of the sale of the
mortgaged property, by publication of the notice

their unit (the Apartment) at the Executive Centre in Honolulu 
for which the AOAO is the apartment owners' association. In the Complaint, the Malabes asserted that the "AOAO was not authorized 
or entitled to conduct a nonjudicial foreclosure or power of sale under Part I and the sale that occurred was unlawful and constituted a wrongful foreclosure." On appeal, the Malabes 
contend that HRS § 667-5 may be used only when a power of sale is 
contained in a mortgage or other governing document, and that because such a power of sale was not present in this case, the foreclosure was not permitted by Hawai' i law. 
The Hawai' i Supreme Court has held that "[p]rior to its 
repeal in 2012, HRS § 667-5 authorized the non-judicial foreclosure of mortgaged property only '[w]hen a power of sale is contained in a mortgage.'" Santiago v. Tanaka, 137 Hawai' i 137, 
154, 366 P.3d 612, 629 (2016) (emphasis added; footnote omitted) (citing HRS § 667-5(a) (repealed 2012)). In Santiago, the supreme court reiterated its prior holding that HRS § 667-5 "[did] not independently provide for a power of sale." Id. at 
3(...continued)
 
once in each of three successive weeks . . . ;
and 
(2)	 Give any notices and do all acts as are
authorized or required by the power
contained in the mortgage.
. . . .
 (c) Upon the request of any person entitled to notice
. . . , [the] attorney shall disclose the requestor the following
information: 
(1)	 The amount to cure the default, together with
the estimated amount of the foreclosing
mortgagee's attorneys' fees and costs . . . ;
and 
(2)	 The sale price of the mortgaged property once
auctioned.

155, 366 P.3d at 630. Moreover, "'no state statute creates a 
right in mortgagees to proceed by non-judicial foreclosure; the right is created by contract.'" Id. (quoting Lee v. HSBC Bank 
USA, 121 Hawai' i 287, 292, 218 P.3d 775, 780 (2009)). 
We recently recognized this holding, specifically in 
the context of apartment owner associations, in our analysis of the amended Chapter 667 and concluded that "[a] search of the legislative history, as well as the text, of HRS chapter 667 from the time [§ 667-5] was enacted in 1998 . . . reveals no legislative purpose or intent to grant any class of persons or entities with a power of sale over the property of others." Sakal v. Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Hawaiian Monarch, 143 Hawai'i 219, 225, 426 P.3d 443, 449 (App. 2018). Instead, HRS 
§ 667-5 merely "authorize[d] a sale," where such a power is independently provided by an agreement between the parties. Santiago, 137 Hawai' i at 155, 366 P.3d at 630; see also Sakal, 
143 Hawai' i at 225, 426 P.3d at 449 ("The Hawai' i Foreclosures 
statute sets forth the procedures for foreclosure in Hawai' i and 
does not create a right to foreclose...."). Accordingly, in order for an association to invoke this authority and utilize the procedures outlined in HRS § 667-5, there must have existed an agreement that independently provides for a power of sale. 
Here, the AOAO did not argue that it had a power of
 
sale under a mortgage or pursuant to its bylaws or some other
 agreement containing a power of sale. Instead, the AOAO asserts
 
4
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that the plain text of HRS § 514B-146 (2006)4 authorizes the AOAO
 
to conduct a nonjudicial foreclosure on the Apartment under HRS
 
§ 667-5, without regard to a power of sale provision. HRS
 
§ 514B-146 provides an apartment owners' association with a
 
priority lien over a unit in the case of any unpaid share of
 common expenses chargeable to that unit, which "may be foreclosed
 by action or by nonjudicial or power of sale foreclosure
 procedures set forth in chapter 667 . . . in like manner as a
 mortgage of real property." HRS § 514B-146(a) (amended 2012). 
The AOAO asserts that this constitutes a legislative grant of
 authority for it to use the nonjudicial foreclosure procedures in
 HRS § 667-5 and that a power of sale arises from this legislative
 authority.
 
We reject this argument as it disregards the plain 
language and legislative intent of both HRS § 667-5 and § 514B­146(a). See Sakal, 143 Hawai' i at 225-28, 426 P.3d at 449-52. 
As noted, HRS § 667-5 (repealed 2012) did not grant a power of sale but merely authorized use of certain nonjudicial procedures in order to effect a foreclosure only "[w]hen a power of sale [was] contained in a mortgage." HRS § 667-5(a) (repealed 2012); 
4 HRS § 514B-146 (amended 2012), stated, in relevant part:
 
[§ 514B-146] Association fiscal matters; lien
for assessments. (a) All sums assessed by the
association but unpaid for the share of the common
expenses chargeable to any unit shall constitute a
lien on the unit with priority over all other liens .
. . . 
The lien of the association may be foreclosed by
action or by nonjudicial or power of sale foreclosure
procedures set forth in chapter 667, by the managing
agent or board, acting on behalf of the association,
in like manner as a mortgage of real property.

Santiago, 137 Hawai' i at 154, 366 P.3d at 629; Lee, 121 Hawai' i at 
289, 218 P.3d at 777. As we have previously stated, the phrase
 
"in like manner as a mortgage of real property"5 was intended to
 
clarify that associations could avail themselves of less
 burdensome procedures, but was not a grant of heretofore non­existent statutory powers of sale. Sakal, 143 Hawai' i at 227, 
426 P.3d at 451 (analyzing the correlative and identical
 provision to HRS § 514B-146(a), prior to the 2012 amendments). 
Thus, here, as in Sakal, "we will not infer that the power to
 extrajudicially sell another person's property was granted, in
 the absence of a clear legislative act doing so." Id. 
Accordingly, we conclude that the Malabes stated a
 
cognizable claim for wrongful foreclosure against the AOAO for
 which some relief may be granted.
6 See Sakal, 143 Hawai' i at 
5 This language was removed from the statute in 2012 with the
addition of an alternate power of sale process specifically for associations.
See HRS § 514B-146(a) (Supp. 2017); see also Sakal, 143 Hawai 'i at 228, 426
P.3d at 452 (Discussing the post-2012 statutory scheme, we explained that"[i]t is clear that, with the addition of a new part to HRS chapter 667 (PartVI) establishing an alternative power of sale process specifically forassociations, which was modeled after but not identical to the process setforth in Part II HRS chapter 667, the reference to 'like manner as a mortgageof real property' became superfluous, if not confusing."). 
6 While the Circuit Court does not appear to have dismissed the
wrongful foreclosure claim on the basis of the statute of limitations, wereject the AOAO's request for us to conclude that a cause of action forwrongful foreclosure is subject to the two-year statute of limitationsprovision under HRS § 657-7. See, e.g., Hungate v. Law Office of David B. 
Rosen, 139 Hawai 'i 394, 400, 391 P.3d 1, 7 (2017) (wherein the supreme court
recognized the validity of a wrongful foreclosure claim in a complaint filedfour years after the foreclosure sale at issue).
Additionally, because we conclude that the Malabes' claim for
wrongful foreclosure may proceed on the basis that the AOAO was not authorizedto conduct the foreclosure pursuant to HRS § 667-5 without a power of sale, wedo not reach the Malabes' argument that the AOAO is bound by, and purportedlyviolated, the duties set forth in Ulrich v. Sec. Inv. Co., 35 Haw. 158 (Haw.Terr. 1939). See, e.g., Kondaur Capital Corp. v. Matsuyoshi, 136 Hawai 'i 227,
240, 361 P.3d 454, 467 (2015) ("Ulrich requires mortgagees to exercise theirright to non-judicial foreclosure under a power of sale in a manner that is

232, 426 P.3d at 456. Therefore, the Circuit Court erred in
 
granting the AOAO's motion to dismiss as to Count I.7
 
(2) The Malabes also assert that the Circuit Court
 
erred in dismissing their UDAP claim, contending that they are
 consumers for UDAP purposes, that the AOAO was engaged in trade
 or commerce by facilitating the real estate transaction of a
 nonjudicial foreclosure, and that the AOAO engaged in wrongful
 and deceptive conduct, resulting in the Malabes' loss of the
 Apartment. In response, the AOAO argues, inter alia, that the
 Malabes' UDAP claim is time-barred under HRS § 480-24 (2008).

fair, reasonably diligent, and in good faith, and to demonstrate that an
adequate price was procured for the property.").
 
7 In the Answering Brief, the AOAO requests, if this court rejects
their position that the relevant statutory scheme grants them a power of sale,that on remand the AOAO be permitted to present the AOAO's governing documentsto the Circuit Court. Unlike in Sakal, the AOAO's bylaws and/or othergoverning documents are not before us in this appeal. See Sakal, 143 Hawai 'i 
at 229-30, 426 P.3d 453-54. On remand, the AOAO is free to establish that itsbylaws and/or other governing documents confer a power of sale over theApartment. 
8	 HRS § 480-24, provides, in relevant part:
 
§ 480-24 Limitation of actions. (a) Any action to
enforce a cause of action arising under this chapter shall
be barred unless commenced within four years after the cause
of action accrues, except as otherwise provided in
subsection (b). . . . For the purpose of this section, a
cause of action for a continuing violation is deemed to
accrue at any time during the period of the violation.
(b) The following shall toll the time for
commencement of actions by the State under this chapter if
at any time:
(1)	 Any cause of action arising under this chapter
accrues against any person, the person is out of
the State . . . .
 
(2)	 Any cause of action arising under this chapter
accrues against any person, the person has
petitioned for relief under the bankruptcy code
. . . .
 
(3)	 Any cause of action arising under this chapter
accrues against any person, there is a criminal
action pending which arises out of the same
occurrence . . . .

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRS § 480-24(a) provides that "[a]ny action to enforce 
a cause of action arising under this chapter shall be barred 
unless commenced within four years after the cause of action accrues." We have previously recognized and adopted federal court rulings that "a cause of action for unlawful business practices accrues upon occurrence of alleged violation, rather than when plaintiff discovers the violation." Reyes v. HSBC Bank 
USA, Nat'l Ass'n, 2015 WL 3476371, *5 (Haw. App. May 29, 2015) (SDO) (emphasis added) (citing McDevitt v. Guenther, 522 F.Supp.2d 1272, 1289 (D. Hawai' i 2007)); see also Kersh v. 
Manulife Fin. Corp., 792 F.Supp.2d 1111, 1122 (D. Hawai' i 2011); 
Heejoon Chung v. U.S. Bank, N.A., 250 F.Supp.3d 658, 671-73 (D. Haw. 2017). 
The Malabes' cause of action accrued on or about
 
December 17, 2010, when the AOAO "collect[ed] [the] debt," i.e.,
 conducted the foreclosure sale and submitted the winning bid to
 purchase the Apartment. As the Malabes filed their Complaint on
 
December 13, 2016, nearly six years after the purportedly
 
unlawful foreclosure, their claims are time-barred by HRS § 480­24.
 
The Malabes argue that, regardless of the plain
 
language of HRS § 480-24, equitable tolling applies "because
 [the] AOAO falsely represented that it was authorized to use
 § 667-5 to conduct the nonjudicial foreclosure" and thus the
 Malabes were "not aware of their claims." 
8
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
We have recognized that equitable tolling may be
 
available to toll the statute of limitations for a UDAP claim
 
where it is based on allegations of fraudulent concealment. 
Reyes, 2015 WL 3476371, at *6. Fraudulent concealment "involves
 
the actions taken by a liable party to conceal a known cause of
 
action." Au v. Au, 63 Haw. 210, 215, 626 P.2d 173, 178 (1981). 
Here, the Complaint alleges that the AOAO "fraudulently
 
concealed the wrong they were committing by implying, stating
 
and/or misrepresenting that they were authorized to use [§ 667-5]
 and/or that they held a mortgage with a power of sale when in
 fact they did not." In other words, the Malabes allege that
 simply by virtue of relying on HRS § 667-5, the AOAO fraudulently
 concealed the Malabes' cause of action. 
We reject this argument. As alleged in the Complaint,
 
the AOAO "published notice that they would sell the Apartment at
 a public sale pursuant to Section 667-5." The Malabes cite no
 authority for the proposition that reliance on a statutory
 authority, even if that reliance later proves to be wrong,
 constitutes fraudulent concealment, and we find none. The
 Complaint contains no allegations that the AOAO concealed or
 misrepresented its use of HRS § 667-5. We decline to
 characterize the Malabes' later-developed, but cognizable and
 ultimately successful, legal theory as stating a claim for
 fraudulent concealment by the AOAO at the time the AOAO relied on
 HRS § 667-5. Therefore, we conclude that the Malabes failed to 
9
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
allege fraudulent concealment sufficient to state a claim to
 
equitable tolling of the statute of limitations on their UDAP
 claim. 
Accordingly, we conclude that the Circuit Court did not
 
err in dismissing Count II of the Malabes' Complaint.
9
 
In accordance with the above, the Circuit Court's
 
February 17, 2017 Judgment is vacated in part, with respect to
 the dismissal of Count I of the Complaint, and affirmed in part,
 with respect to the dismissal of Count II of the Complaint. This
 case is remanded to the Circuit Court for further proceedings.
