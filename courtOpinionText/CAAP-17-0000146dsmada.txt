ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL
 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, and Reifurth and Chan, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the Motion to Dismiss PlaintiffÂ­
Appellant's Appeal filed on May 23, 2018 by Defendants-Appellees,
 
ASSOCIATION OF APARTMENT OWNERS OF KAI MAKANI, HAWAIIANA
 MANAGEMENT COMPANY, LTD., RYAN TEFFT, and JERRY SULLIVAN
 (Appellees), the papers in support, and the record, and there
 being no opposition, it appears that (1) the parties have reached
 a settlement and have executed a Settlement and Release,
 effective May 7, 2018, which provides, in part, that Plaintiff-
Appellant JAMES BLACK, Individually and as Trustee of the
 ALLEN-BLACK TRUST OF 2007 (Appellant) "agrees to dismiss all of
 his claims in the Appeal with prejudice[,]" and "further states
 that each party is responsible for payment of that party's own
 attorneys' fees and legal expenses incurred in the appeal"; (2)
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
on May 22, 2018, this court disapproved a stipulation to dismiss
 
the appeal because it did not specify whether each party would
 bear their own attorneys' fees, and it was executed by Appellees'
 counsel and Appellant Pro Se, but not by Appellant's counsel of
 record; and (3) various efforts over the last three months by
 Appellant Pro Se and Appellees' counsel to communicate with
 Appellant's counsel regarding the settlement have been
 unsuccessful.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion is
 
granted and the appeal is dismissed with prejudice. The parties
 shall bear their own attorneys' fees and costs.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are
 
dismissed.
