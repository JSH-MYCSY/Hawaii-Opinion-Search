APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(S.P. NO. 14-1-000564-12) 
JANUARY 31, 2022 
WADSWORTH, PRESIDING JUDGE, AND NAKASONE, J.,
AND McCULLEN, J., DISSENTING 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY WADSWORTH, J. 
This appeal arises out of a dispute concerning two 
arbitration awards, which were issued in favor of Respondent-
Appellant/Cross-Appellee Knox Hoversland Architects, Ltd. (
KHA) 
and Respondent-Appellee/Cross-Appellant ConstRX, Ltd. (CRX) 
(collectively, Respondents) and against Claimant-Appellee/Cross-
Appellee Association of Apartment Owners of the Palm Villas at 
Mauna Lani Resort (AOAO). KHA appeals and CRX cross-appeals from 
the April 3, 2017 Amended Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law 
and Order (Amended FOF/COL/Order), entered in the Circuit Court    
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of the First Circuit1/ (Circuit Court), which: (1) granted AOAO's 
October 31, 2014 motion to vacate the September 16, 2014 Interim 
Arbitration Award (Interim Award); (2) granted AOAO's April 1, 
2015 motion to vacate the February 9, 2015 Final Arbitration 
Award (Final Award); and (3) denied CRX's February 13, 2015 
motion to confirm the Final Award, which KHA joined on March 10, 
2015. 
On appeal, Respondents contend that the Circuit Court 
erred in vacating the Interim Award and the Final Award (collectively, the Arbitration Awards) due to evident partiality. 
In particular, Respondents contend that the Circuit Court erred 
in concluding that: (1) the arbitrator, Judge Riki May Amano (Ret.) (the Arbitrator or Judge Amano), failed to make reasonable 
inquiries and failed to make full and appropriate disclosures of 
her relationships with the parties and counsel prior to and during the arbitration; and (2) AOAO did not waive its right to object to the Arbitrator.
2/ 
We hold that under the circumstances of this case, the 
Arbitrator's failure to timely disclose to the parties that she recently had been appointed as an arbitrator in another matter, involving an attorney who also had been involved in the present matter, could reasonably have been perceived as likely to affect the Arbitrator's impartiality in the arbitration underlying this appeal. Thus, the Circuit Court did not clearly err in ruling that a reasonable impression of partiality, and thus evident partiality, was established on this ground. We further hold that the Circuit Court did not clearly err in ruling that AOAO did not waive its right to challenge the Arbitrator on this ground. Accordingly, we affirm the Amended FOF/COL/Order. 
I. Background 
The following findings of fact by the Circuit Court are 
unchallenged on appeal and are thus binding on the parties and 
1/ The Honorable Jeannette H. Castagnetti presided. 
2/ Respondents' respective points of error have been restated and
condensed for organizational clarity.

(Record citations omitted; some brackets in original.) 
On March 1, 2016, the Circuit Court held a status 
conference regarding the pending motions to vacate the Interim 
Award and the Final Award and the pending motion to confirm the Final Award, all of which had been consolidated for a hearing. At that time, "all counsel agreed that no evidentiary hearing would be necessary to dispose of the consolidated motions. . . ." 
On August 17, 2016, the Circuit Court heard the 
consolidated motions. 
7 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On March 3, 2017, the Circuit Court issued its Findings 
of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order, which granted AOAO's 
motions to vacate the Interim Award and the Final Award, and denied Respondents' motion to confirm the Final Award. 
On 
April 3, 2017, the Circuit Court issued the Amended FOF/COL/Order. 
The Circuit Court concluded that "the cumulative effect 
of undisclosed prior and ongoing relationships between Judge Amano and the Respondents' attorneys and their respective firms demonstrates a reasonable impression of partiality that warrants vacatur of the arbitration award." The Circuit Court further concluded, among other things: 
30. The evidence supports this Court's conclusion
that Judge Amano violated the disclosure requirements of
[Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS)] chapter 658A and DPR Rule 9
by failing to make reasonable inquiries of all past,current, and anticipated future relationships with theparties' attorneys or representatives, and by failing todisclose them, thus creating a reasonable impression ofpartiality. 
31. In particular, Judge Amano did not disclose to
the parties that she had been appointed as arbitrator in amatter involving O'Connor Playdon Attorneys Inouye andKopper (formerly of O'Connor Playdon) on November 6, 2013,eight days before appointment in the underlying arbitration. 
. . . . 
36. Under the circumstances, including the close
proximity in time of Judge Amano's appointment asarbitrator, a reasonable person would consider the fact thaton November 18, 2013, Judge Amano stated that she knewAttorney Inouye and worked with other lawyers in his firmyet did not disclose that he was involved in another matterwhere she was appointed arbitrator on November 6, 2013,creates an impression of possible bias. 
. . . . 
42. This Court, therefore, concludes that [AOAO] has
adequately established evident partiality by Judge Amano, aneutral arbitrator. 
43. Consequently, the interim and final arbitration
awards are hereby vacated pursuant to HRS§ 658A-23(a)(2)(A). 
. . . . 
48. This Court concludes that [AOAO] has not waived
its right to challenge Judge Amano on the ground of evidentpartiality. 
49. . . . [AOAO] has proffered sufficient evidence to
support the contention that had Judge Amano disclosed that 
8  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
she had been retained by O'Connor Playdon eight days before
being appointed in the underlying arbitration, or had shedisclosed the number of times she had been retained by thelaw firms representing Respondents, [AOAO] would not haveagreed to her appointment. 
This appeal and cross-appeal followed. 
II. Standards of Review 
The Hawai# i Supreme Court has set out the applicable 
standards for judicial review of an arbitration award as follows: 
Judicial review of an arbitration award is limited to 
the statutory grounds for confirmation, vacatur,modification, and correction. 
See HRS § 658A-28(a)(3)-(5)
(Supp. 2001). Review of a motion to vacate an arbitration award "does not involve review of an arbitrator's findingsof fact or conclusions of law." Nordic[ PCL Const., Inc. v.
LPIHGC, LLC], 136 Hawai #i [29, ]42, 358 P.3d [1, ]14
[ (2015)]. "Rather, it involves review of a circuit court'sfactual findings and conclusions of law as to whether thestatutorily outlined grounds for vacatur exist." Id. 
We review a circuit court's findings of fact under the
clearly erroneous standard. [Noel ]Madamba[ Contracting LLC
v.
 Romero], 137 Hawai #i [1, ]8, 364 P.3d [518, ]525
[ (2015)]. . . . 
We review a circuit court's conclusions of 
law de novo
 under the right/wrong standard. Nordic, 136
Hawai #i at 41, 358 P.3d at 13 (quoting Daiichi[ Hawai #i Real 
Estate Corp. v. Lichter], 103 Hawai #i [325, ]336, 82 P.3d
[411, ]422[ (2003)]). 
Where a conclusion of law presents a
mixed question of law and fact, we review this conclusionunder the clearly erroneous standard. Madamba, 137 Hawai #i 
at 8, 364 P.3d at 525 (citing Estate of Klink ex rel. Klinkv.
 State, 113 Hawai #i 332, 351, 152 P.3d 504, 523 (2007)).
A mixed question of law and fact is a conclusion "dependentupon the facts and circumstances of the particular case."Price v. Zoning Bd. of Appeals, 77 Hawai #i 168, 172, 883
P.2d 629, 633 (1994). 
We review a circuit court's rulings on a motion to
vacate for evident partiality under the "clearly erroneousstandard" where the court's challenged conclusion was basedon a "mixed question of law and fact." Madamba, 137 Hawai #i 
at 9, 364 P.3d at 526. 
Narayan v. Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Kapalua Bay Condo., 140 
Hawai#i 75, 83, 398 P.3d 664, 672 (2017). 
III. Discussion 
A. Evident Partiality and Failure to Make Necessary Disclosures 
Respondents contend that the Circuit Court erred in 
vacating the Arbitration Awards due to evident partiality. Respondents argue, among other things, that the Arbitrator's disclosures to the parties were proper and timely. In response, 
9 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
AOAO contends that the Circuit Court correctly found that the 
Arbitrator failed to make full and appropriate disclosures. 
The supreme court has addressed an arbitrator's 
statutory disclosure requirements, as well as vacatur based on
 
evident partiality, in a series of three decisions. See Narayan, 
140 Hawai# i at 83–90, 398 P.3d at 672–79; Madamba, 137 Hawai# i at 
9-16, 364 P.3d at 526-33; Nordic, 136 Hawai# i at 42-52, 358 P.3d 
at 14-24. In Narayan, the court stated: 
An arbitration award may be vacated only upon the grounds
specified in HRS § 658A-23. Pursuant to HRS § 658A-23(a)(2)(A), the court must vacate an arbitrationaward if there was evident partiality by an arbitratorappointed to serve as a neutral. Madamba, 137 Hawai #i at 3,
364 P.3d at 520. 
Evident partiality may be found in two
situations: when an arbitrator fails to make necessarydisclosures to the parties, or when additional facts showactual bias or improper motive, even if the arbitrator makesthe necessary disclosures. See Valrose Maui, Inc. v. Maclyn
Morris, Inc., 105 F. Supp. 2d 1118, 1124 (D. Haw. 2000); 
see
also Schmitz v. Zilveti, 20 F.3d 1043, 1045-47 (9th Cir.1994) (distinguishing the evident partiality standardsapplied in "nondisclosure" cases and "actual bias" cases). 
140 Hawai# i at 84, 398 P.3d at 673 (footnote omitted). 
In a nondisclosure case, "evident partiality is 
established where 'undisclosed facts demonstrate a reasonable 
impression of partiality.'" Madamba, 137 Hawai# i at 10, 364 P.3d 
at 527 (quoting Nordic, 136 Hawai# i at 51, 358 P.3d at 23). 
"Under this standard, a finding of evident partiality 'is not dependent on a showing that the arbitrator was actually biased, but instead stems from the nondisclosure itself.'" Narayan, 140 
Hawai#i at 84, 398 P.3d at 673 (quoting Madamba, 137 Hawai# i at 
10, 364 P.3d at 527). 
HRS § 658A-12 (Supp. 2013) codifies an arbitrator's 
duty to disclose facts that may create an appearance of bias. Section 658A-12 provides, in relevant part: 
(a) Before accepting appointment, an individual who is
requested to serve as an arbitrator, after making a
reasonable inquiry, shall disclose to all parties to theagreement to arbitrate and arbitration proceeding and to anyother arbitrators any known facts that a reasonable personwould consider likely to affect the impartiality of thearbitrator in the arbitration proceeding, including: 
(1) A financial or personal interest in the outcomeof the arbitration proceeding; and 
10 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2) An existing or past relationship with any of the
parties to the agreement to arbitrate or thearbitration proceeding, their counsel orrepresentatives, a witness, or anotherarbitrator. 
(b) An arbitrator has a continuing obligation to
disclose to all parties to the agreement to arbitrate andarbitration proceeding and to any other arbitrators anyfacts that the arbitrator learns after accepting appointmentwhich a reasonable person would consider likely to affectthe impartiality of the arbitrator. 
Pursuant to these provisions, "arbitrators must at the outset 
disclose, then continually disclose throughout the course of an arbitration proceeding, any known facts that a reasonable person would consider likely to affect the arbitrator's impartiality." Nordic, 136 Hawai# i at 47, 358 P.3d at 19. 
The supreme court has held that "a neutral arbitrator's 
violation of statutory disclosure requirements under HRS § 658A-12(a) or (b) 'constitutes "evident partiality" as a matter of law.'" Narayan, 140 Hawai# i at 85, 398 P.3d at 674 (quoting 
Nordic, 136 Hawai# i at 50, 358 P.3d at 22). In this context, 
"once evident partiality as to a neutral arbitrator is established, the arbitration award must be vacated." Id. at 86, 
398 P.3d at 675 (brackets omitted) (quoting Madamba, 137 Hawai# i 
at 16 n.20, 364 P.3d at 533 n.20). 
In Narayan, the supreme court "clarif[ied] the scope of 
the arbitrator's disclosure requirements as well as contextualize[d] the reasonable person standard in light of the undisclosed facts revealed through post-award discovery." Id. at 
86, 398 P.3d at 675. "The 'fundamental standard' of the disclosure obligation 'is an objective one: disclosure is required of facts that a reasonable person would consider likely to affect the arbitrator's impartiality in the arbitration proceeding.'" Id. (quoting Nordic, 136 Hawai# i at 47, 358 P.3d 
at 19). 
"It is thus the circuit court's role to determine 
whether the undisclosed facts meet this objective standard." Id.
The supreme court also has observed: 
Patterns emerging in case law have evolved through
court efforts to identify undisclosed relationships that are
"more than trivial" and thus require vacatur due to evidentpartiality, and those that are "too insubstantial to warrantvacating an award." Commonwealth Coatings[ Corp. v. 
11 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Continental Casualty Co.], 393 U.S. [145, ]152, 89 S. Ct.
337[, 340-41 (1968) ](White, J., concurring) (emphasisadded). Courts will weigh factors in a case-by-caseapproach to determine how a reasonable person wouldobjectively perceive the relationship and its potentialimpact on the arbitration proceeding. 
Id. at 87, 398 P.3d at 676. 
Determining whether a relationship is "substantive" – 
for the purpose of determining whether the relationship would 
give a reasonable impression of partiality – may involve the consideration of several factors, including: (1) the directness of the connection between the arbitrator and a party; (2) the type of connection or activity at issue; and (3) the timing of the connection or activity. See id. Accordingly, in evaluating 
the disclosure issue in the present case, we analyze each of these factors below. 
1. Connection Between the Arbitrator and a Party 
"The more direct an undisclosed connection between the 
arbitrator and a party, the more likely that it will create a reasonable impression of partiality." Narayan, 140 Hawai# i at 
88, 398 P.3d at 677. 
Thus, "a current direct relationship 
between an arbitrator and 'a party, its counsel, principal, or agent' will almost always require disclosure." Id. (quoting 
Valrose
, 105 F. Supp. 2d at 1124). In contrast, "[t]he more 
'attenuated' and less direct the connections between a party and an arbitrator, the less likely it will be that the relationship will require disclosure, even if those relationships are current." Id. (citing New Regency Prods., Inc. v. Nippon Herald 
Films, Inc., 501 F.3d 1101, 1110 (9th Cir. 2007)). 
Here, on November 18, 2013, the Arbitrator disclosed to 
the parties: 
I know counsels Terry Revere, Cid Inouye and Jeff Juliano,
and I have worked with other lawyers in their respective lawfirms, in my capacity as a former state court judge between1992-2003 or in my post-retirement years as an arbitrator ormediator with DPR; I do not know Malia Nickison-Beazley. 
I have no other professional, social or personal
interactions with anyone involved in this case. 
12 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
However, the Arbitrator did not disclose to the parties that on 
November 6, 2013, she had been appointed as an arbitrator in an unrelated matter in which Attorneys Inouye and Kopper represented a party. 
KHA argues that "the Arbitrator did not have a duty to 
disclose her relationship with Attorneys Inouye and Kopper because they did not participate in the arbitration proceedings." CRX makes a similar argument. 
Respondents are correct that under 
HRS § 658A-12(a)(2), supra, the term "counsel" "does not include all attorneys in the law firm of an attorney representing a party to an arbitration[.]" Madamba, 137 Hawai# i at 12 n.18, 364 P.3d 
at 529 n.18 (quoting Nordic, 136 Hawai# i at 48, 358 P.3d at 20). 
However, HRS § 658A–12(a) "requires that an arbitrator disclose facts that a reasonable person would consider likely to affect the arbitrator's impartiality." Id. (quoting Nordic, 136 Hawai# i 
at 48, 358 P.3d at 20). 
Thus, "[d]epending on the circumstances, 
such facts could include an arbitrator's relationships with other attorneys within a law firm of counsel representing a party to the arbitration." Id.
 (quoting Nordic, 136 Hawai# i at 48, 358 
P.3d at 20). 
Here, while Attorney Inouye did not represent CRX in 
the underlying arbitration itself, it is undisputed that he did prepare for and attend the October 24, 2013 mediation that immediately preceded the arbitration, on behalf of Attorney Juliano, representing CRX. It is similarly undisputed that Attorney Inouye billed CRX 11.3 hours for his work relating to the mediation. As the Circuit Court found, and Respondents do not dispute: 
Judge Amano was aware that Attorney Inouye had been involved
in this matter, albeit he did not participate in the
arbitration, when she specifically disclosed on November 18,
2013, that she knew "Terry Revere, Cid Inouye and JeffJuliano" and had worked with other lawyers in AttorneyInouye's firm in her capacity as a former state court judgeand as an arbitrator or mediator with DPR. 
Additionally, the Circuit Court found, and Respondents do not 
dispute, that "the attorneys, DPR, and Judge Amano considered Attorney Inouye's involvement in this matter significant enough to copy him in email correspondence, in particular, those containing disclosures." 
13 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Under these circumstances, the then-current 
relationship between the Arbitrator and Attorney Inouye, who 
represented CRX in the mediation immediately preceding the underlying arbitration, was more direct than attenuated. 
This 
factor thus weighed in favor of the Arbitrator disclosing that she recently had been appointed as an arbitrator in another matter involving O'Connor Playdon Attorney Inouye. 
2. Type of Connection or Activity 
The supreme court has recognized that "[c]ertain types 
of relationships will also weigh more heavily toward disclosure 
than others." Narayan, 140 Hawai# i at 88, 398 P.3d at 677. For 
example, "[b]usiness relationships and financial dealings will . . . tend to weigh in favor of disclosure, depending on the weight of other considerations, including the regularity and recency of the dealings, the length of the relationship, and the extent of pecuniary interest involved." Id. at 89, 398 P.3d at 678. 
Moreover, "[w]here the relationship involves an exchange of money or other consideration, it is likely to require disclosure, particularly if the exchange was recent or ongoing during the arbitration." Id. 
In Narayan, the supreme court held in part that the 
circuit court did not clearly err in ruling that the arbitrator's duty of disclosure did not include her retention in unrelated matters by the law firm of an alleged "hearsay witness." Id. at 
91, 398 P.3d at 680. The court noted that the "hearsay witness" was not a witness in the arbitration proceeding at issue, and it "[wa]s unclear how Appellants' allegations make him a 'hearsay witness.'" Id. at 91 n.17, 398 P.3d at 680 n.17. In that 
context, the supreme court concluded: "The [a]rbitrator's employment by [the law firm] in unrelated matters does not have a sufficient nexus to this arbitration to require a holding that the circuit court clearly erred. There is no actual direct 
connection between [the law firm] and the parties, counsel, 
14   
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
witnesses, and [a]rbitrator in this arbitration
."3/ Id. at 91, 
398 P.3d at 680 (emphasis added). 
Here, in contrast, there was a more direct connection 
between the Arbitrator and Attorney Inouye, who represented CRX 
in the mediation immediately preceding the underlying arbitration, and who was copied by the Arbitrator in email correspondence regarding the arbitration. It was in this context that the Arbitrator was appointed as arbitrator in another matter involving O'Connor Playdon Attorney Inouye, just eight days before the Arbitrator's appointment in the underlying arbitration here. Given the recency of the Arbitrator's appointment in the other matter, as well as the Circuit Court's other undisputed findings regarding the Arbitrator's relationship with Inouye, the Arbitrator's appointment in the other matter was the type of activity that could reasonably be perceived to affect an arbitrator's impartiality.
4/ See Valrose, 105 F. Supp. 2d at 
1123-24 (concluding that a "reasonable impression of partiality" existed where the arbitrator failed to disclose an ex parte discussion with one party's counsel regarding "the possibility of the Arbitrator's mediating in an unrelated legal malpractice action" and stating that the discussion "was clearly required to be disclosed" and "the nondisclosure of the discussion and appointment [as mediator] was clearly a serious failing"). This factor thus also weighed in favor of the Arbitrator disclosing that she recently had been appointed as an arbitrator in another matter involving O'Connor Playdon Attorney Inouye. 
3/ The supreme court also recognized that the law firm was
representing the developer in a separate action, which was adverse to the
appellants, "but the theory that a positive outcome for the AOAO [ i.e., the
party adverse to the appellants in the arbitration at issue] would lead to a
future appointment for the [a]rbitrator in the [separate action] is'contingent, attenuated, and merely potential.'" Narayan, 140 Hawai #i at 91,
398 P.3d at 680 (quoting In re Sussex, 781 F.3d 1065, 1075 (9th Cir. 2015). 
4/ We do not mean to suggest there is any evidence in the record that
Attorney Inouye acted with an improper motive or that the Arbitrator wasactually biased by virtue of her appointment in the unrelated matter. We have found none. As previously discussed, however, a finding of evident partiality"is not dependent on a showing that the arbitrator was actually biased," butstems from the nondisclosure itself. Narayan, 140 Hawai #i at 84, 398 P.3d at
673 (quoting Madamba, 137 Hawai #i at 10, 364 P.3d at 527). 
15    FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
3.
 Timing of the Connection or Activity 
"[R]elationships that are not 'distant in time, but 
rather ongoing during the arbitration' will weigh most heavily in 
favor of disclosure, while relationships that are 'long past' will not." Narayan, 140 Hawai# i at 90, 398 P.3d at 679 (quoting 
New Regency, 501 F.3d at 1110, and citing Lagstein v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's, London, 607 F.3d 634, 646 (9th Cir. 2010)). 
Here, as noted above, the Circuit Court found, and 
Respondents do not dispute, that "[the Arbitrator] did not disclose to the parties that she had been appointed as arbitrator in a matter involving O'Connor Playdon Attorneys Inouye and Kopper (formerly of O'Connor Playdon) on November 6, 2013, eight days before appointment in the underlying arbitration." Thus, the recency of the Arbitrator's appointment in the other matter, and its ongoing nature during the underlying arbitration here, "weigh[ed] most heavily in favor of disclosure[.]" Narayan, 140 
Hawai#i at 90, 398 P.3d at 679. 
4. Weighing All of the Relevant Factors 
We have observed that "[t]he judiciary should play a 
minimal role in reviewing impartiality. However, the sine qua 
non for minimal review must be the arbitrator's fidelity to the disclosure obligation." Kay v. Kaiser Found. Health Plan, Inc., 
119 Hawai# i 219, 229, 194 P.3d 1181, 1191 (App. 2008). 
Here, as discussed above, the direct relationship 
between the Arbitrator and Attorney Inouye, the type of activity at issue – i.e., the Arbitrator's recent appointment in another matter involving O'Connor Playdon Attorney Inouye – and the close proximity in time between that activity and the underlying arbitration proceeding here, all weighed in favor of disclosure. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the Arbitrator's failure to timely disclose to the parties that she recently had been appointed as an arbitrator in another matter involving O'Connor Playdon Attorney Inouye could reasonably have been perceived as likely to affect the Arbitrator's impartiality in the underlying arbitration. Accordingly, on this record, the 
16   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Circuit Court did not clearly err in ruling that a reasonable 
impression of partiality, and thus evident partiality, was established on this basis. 
Relatedly, the Circuit Court did not 
err in vacating the Arbitration Awards on this basis. 5/
B. Waiver of Objections 
Respondents argue that even if AOAO's objections to the 
Arbitrator were properly supported by law, the belated nature of the objections constitutes a waiver. 
The supreme court has summarized the waiver principle 
in the arbitration context as follows: 
HRS § 658A–12(d) provides "[i]f the arbitrator did not
disclose a fact as required by subsection (a) or (b), upontimely objection by a party, the court under section658A–23(a)(2) may vacate an award." In addition, a partywho has actual or constructive knowledge of a relationshipof the arbitrator requiring disclosure but "fails to raise aclaim of partiality . . . prior to or during the arbitrationproceeding is deemed to have waived the right to challengethe decision based on 'evident partiality.'" Daiichi, 103
Hawai #i at 345–46, 82 P.3d at 431–32 ("In the arbitration
context, waiver has been defined as consisting of knowledge,actual or constructive, in the complaining party of thetainted relationship or interest of the arbitrator and thefailure to act on that knowledge.") (internal quotationmarks and citations omitted). 
. . . "[T]he question [of] whether a valid waiver
exists is generally a question of fact, [however] 'when thefacts are undisputed it may become a question of law.'" 103 Hawai #i at 346 n. 17, 82 P.3d at 432 n. 17 (quoting Hawaiian
Homes Comm'n v. Bush, 43 Haw. 281, 286 (Terr. 1959)). 
Nordic, 136 Hawai# i at 52, 358 P.3d at 24. 
Here, we initially note that AOAO first raised 
objections to the Arbitrator while the underlying arbitration 
proceeding was still pending, albeit after the Interim Award was issued. Prior to issuance of the Final Award, AOAO sought additional disclosures from the Arbitrator, and filed with DPR a motion to disqualify the Arbitrator and a motion to correct or 
5/ Given our conclusion, we do not address Respondents' argument that
the Circuit Court erred in ruling that the Arbitrator "violated the disclosure
requirements of HRS chapter 658A and DPR Rule 9 by failing to make reasonableinquiries to all past, current, and anticipated future relationships with theparties' attorneys or representatives. . . ." For the same reason, we do notreach Respondents' argument that the Circuit Court erred in ruling that "thecumulative effect" of undisclosed relationships between the Arbitrator and theRespondents' attorneys and their respective firms demonstrated a reasonableimpression of partiality. 
17 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
otherwise modify the Interim Award. 
Both motions were denied. 
AOAO filed with DPR a second motion to disqualify the Arbitrator, 
which was also denied. AOAO then filed the October 31, 2014 motion to vacate the Interim Award in the Circuit Court, which initiated the special proceeding underlying this appeal. When the Final Award was issued, AOAO moved to vacate it as well. Cf. 
Daiichi, 103 Hawai# i at 348, 82 P.3d at 434 (ruling that, 
"inasmuch as Daiichi had actual knowledge of [the arbitrator's] prior attorney-client relationship with [the adverse-party trustees], Daiichi, by failing to raise an objection to [the arbitrator's] appointment as an arbitrator prior to or during the arbitration proceeding, waived its right to challenge the propriety of the arbitration decision on grounds of 'evident partiality'"). 
Respondents contend, however, that AOAO took a "wait-
and-see" approach to challenging the arbitration decision. Daiichi, 103 Hawai# i at 348, 82 P.3d at 434. Respondents argue 
that the Arbitrator's initial disclosures, as well as a statement made by CRX's counsel, Attorney Juliano, at the pre-arbitration conference, were sufficient, and should have at least triggered a duty of inquiry or investigation by AOAO into the Arbitrator's disclosed relationships. 
Regarding the Arbitrator's initial disclosures, the 
Circuit Court found that on November 18, 2013, the Arbitrator stated, in relevant part: 
I know counsels Terry Revere, Cid Inouye and Jeff Juliano,
and I have worked with other lawyers in their respective lawfirms, in my capacity as a former state court judge between1992-2003 or in my post-retirement years as an arbitrator ormediator with DPR[.] 
Regarding Juliano's statement, the Circuit Court made the 
following findings of fact: 
28. On May 1 , 2014, counsel for all the parties
herein attended a pre-arbitration conference before Judge
Amano at DPR's office. 
29. At said pre-arbitration conference, Attorney
Juliano disclosed that Attorneys Inouye and Maxwell K.Kopper (previously an associate at O'Connor Playdon) werebefore Judge Amano the day before, April 30, 2014, arguingan unrelated motion for summary judgment. 
18 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
30. In said unrelated matter, unbeknownst to [AOAO],
Ms. Bryant had confirmed on November 6, 2013, that Judge
Amano was selected as the arbitrator, eight days beforeJudge Amano was selected as arbitrator in this matter. 
31. There was no objection made at the May 1, 2014
pre-arbitration conference with respect to Judge Amanoserving as arbitrator in this matter. 
These unchallenged findings are binding on appeal. See 
Rodrigues, 145 Hawai# i at 494, 454 P.3d at 435. AOAO argues, 
however, that "an alleged oral anecdote by counsel is simply not 
a disclosure by an arbitrator." 
AOAO also maintains: 
HRS § 658A-12 is very clear that disclosures are to be made
by the arbitrator after making a reasonable inquiry, not theparties. Moreover, there is nothing in Judge Amano'sNovember 2013 disclosure that would have prompted the AOAOto inquire as to 2 pending arbitrations that were notdisclosed until after the Interim Award was issued[.] 
As to the Arbitrator's initial disclosures, we conclude 
that her statement, "I know counsel[] . . . Inouye[,]" was 
general, and did not provide AOAO with actual or constructive notice that she recently had been appointed as an arbitrator in another matter involving Attorney Inouye. The Arbitrator's statement, "I have worked with other lawyers in their respective law firms," was also general, and in context conveyed a completed action or relationship. The statement did not provide actual or constructive notice of the Arbitrator's current role as an arbitrator in another matter involving Attorney Inouye. See 
Burlington N.R. Co. v. TUCO Inc., 960 S.W.2d 629, 638 (Tex. 1997) (vacating an arbitration award for evident partiality where a neutral arbitrator initially disclosed past ties to one party's law firm but failed to disclose a post-selection referral by that party's appointed arbitrator for other arbitration work and noting that "a person might reasonably differentiate between a past relationship and one that arises shortly before or during the arbitration proceedings."). 
Based on FOFs 29 and 30, we further conclude that 
Attorney Juliano's May 1, 2014 statement at the pre-arbitration conference did not provide AOAO with actual or constructive knowledge of the Arbitrator's November 6, 2013 appointment in another arbitration matter involving Attorney Inouye. FOF 29 
19  
  
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
cites Paragraph 5 of Attorney Juliano's October 7, 2014 
declaration, in which he described his May 1, 2014 statement as follows: 
At this final Pre-Arbitration Conference, I specifically
brought up with Judge Amano in front of all counsel the factthat my partner, Mr. Inouye, and associate, Mr. Kopper, werebefore her the day prior on April 30, 2014 arguing their MSJin the other unrelated arbitration. In particular, Iinquired as to whether Mr. Kopper argued the motion.
6/ 
(Footnote added.) Thus, Attorney Juliano's oral statement was 
not directed to AOAO's counsel and did not disclose the recent appointment of the Arbitrator in the other, unspecified matter involving Attorney Inouye. Morever, on this record, the oral statement was insufficient to provide AOAO with constructive knowledge of the recent appointment. Cf. Daiichi, 103 Hawai# i at 
348, 82 P.3d at 434 (concluding that Daiichi had constructive knowledge of a letter written by the arbitrator which was contained in Daiichi's own files). We note, for example, there was no finding by the Circuit Court that AOAO's counsel actually heard
 Attorney Juliano's oral statement in the context (see supra 
note 6) in which it was made.7/ In this regard, we also note that 
Respondents could have requested an evidentiary hearing regarding 
6/ During the December 16, 2015 hearing before the Circuit Court,
Attorney Juliano further explained: 
It's a statement that I made . . . that at a pre-arb
conference, we discussed the one case with Cid Inouye andMax [K]opper in my office, because Max has a very deepvoice, and we were discussing with Judge Amano in thepresence of Terry [Revere] and another counsel, Max's deepvoice, and how he'll probably make a good litigator. That raised the fact that that case was there. 
7/ During the December 16, 2015 hearing before the Circuit Court,
AOAO's counsel, Attorney Revere, stated: 
Mr. Juliano asserted, . . . I made some reference in, Ibelieve it was a phone call precall hearing that should haveindicated to Revere that Judge Amano, we were using her inother matters. 
Again, I won't say that's not true. It could have
happened before I got in the room. It could have happenedsome other time, but I'm telling you, I never heard that,and so they're using that as, well, they knew. That's another fact that's in dispute, because we didn't know. 
We 
had no idea until after the arbitration, when the law firmstarted making disclosures, and then eventually Judge Amanomade disclosures.

               FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
AOAO's claim of evident partiality, as well as Respondents' 
waiver assertion. 
The Circuit Court made clear, however, that 
"all counsel agreed that no evidentiary hearing would be necessary to dispose of the consolidated motions[.]" On this record, we conclude that the Circuit Court did not clearly err in ruling that AOAO did not waive its right to challenge the Arbitrator on the ground of evident partiality, based on the Arbitrator's November 6, 2013 appointment in the other matter involving Attorney Inouye.

DISSENTING OPINION BY MCCULLEN, J. 
I respectfully dissent. 
Notwithstanding an 
arbitrator's duty to disclose, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 
§ 658A-12 (2016) requires that an objection be timely. Here, the 
Association of Apartment Owners of the Palm Villas at Mauna Lani Resort's (AOAO) objection was not. 
I. RELEVANT BACKGROUND 
A. November 18, 2013 - Arbitrator Disclosure 
On November 18, 2013, Arbitrator Judge Riki May Amano 
(Ret.) (Arbitrator) disclosed a relationship with attorneys 
Terrance M. Revere, Cid H. Inouye, and Jeffre W. Juliano, as well 
as attorneys in their firms. She explained to the parties that she knew these attorneys and other attorneys in their firms in her capacity as a former judge and as an arbitrator and mediator with the Dispute Prevention & Resolution, Inc. (DPR). Arbitrator 
also disclosed that she did not know Malia Nickison-Beazley, who 
was Attorney Revere's co-counsel representing AOAO. 
B. May 1, 2014 - Attorney Juliano's Statement 
About five months later, on May 1, 2014, at the pre-
arbitration conference attended by counsel for all parties, 
Attorney Juliano stated that Attorney Inouye appeared before Arbitrator in an unrelated arbitration the day prior. In that unrelated matter, Arbitrator was selected by DPR via strike-off method on November 6, 2013, eight days before she was selected as arbitrator in this case. This was previously unknown to Attorney Revere. No further inquiry, comment, or objection was made following Attorney Juliano's statement as to Arbitrator's 
22 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
continued service. 
The arbitration proceeding soon followed, 
commencing on May 5, 2014 and concluding on May 12, 2014. 
C. September 16, 2014 - Interim Arbitration Award 
About ten months after Arbitrator's disclosure that she 
knew Attorney Inouye and about four months after Attorney 
Juliano's statement that Attorney Inouye appeared before Arbitrator in an unrelated matter, Arbitrator issued the Interim Arbitration Award (Interim Award) against AOAO and in favor of 
ConstRX, Ltd. (CRX) for $205,539.49 (the unpaid balance owed by AOAO) and $431,462.47 (retainage) on September 16, 2014. CRX's 
remaining affirmative claims against AOAO were denied. The Interim Award resolved all claims as to all parties except for attorneys' fees and costs, and the parties were asked to submit briefs addressing attorneys' fees and costs for the forthcoming Final Arbitration Award (Final Award). 
D. September 23, 2014 - AOAO's Request 
Seven days after the Interim Award, Attorney Revere 
requested additional disclosures regarding Arbitrator and the 
attorneys in this matter, as well as the attorneys in their firms, going back seven years as follows: 
[A]ny and all matters in which [the Arbitrator] served as
mediator, arbitrator, or in any other capacity for anymatters involving any of the parties or law firms retainedin this matter in the last seven years, including dates whenthe retentions began and when they terminated. We also askthat if there are any other personal or professionalrelationships involving any of the parties or lawyers in thelaw firms (not limited to just counsel that appeared in thismatter) that they be disclosed. 
The parties responded. 
E. AOAO's Motions To Disqualify 
Based on the responses to AOAO's request, AOAO filed a 
Motion to Disqualify the Arbitrator with DPR. DPR denied the 
23 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
motion because 
there [was] no rule or statute authorizing DPR to disqualify
an arbitrator after an award has been issued based on a party's post award investigation of the Arbitrator's priordisclosures[,] which were not objected to and because thereexists no stipulation or agreement of the parties vestingDPR with such authority. 
In response to Arbitrator's supplemental disclosure 
following AOAO's request, AOAO moved a second time to disqualify 
Arbitrator, which DPR dismissed. DPR determined that, "[w]hile the [second] Motion to Disqualify comes on the heels of the Arbitrator's Supplemental Disclosure of October 21, it remains grounded and predicated on [AOAO's] reaction to the Arbitrator's Interim Award[,] [] its post award investigation of the Arbitrator's prior disclosures[,] and the conviction that said disclosures were inadequate." 
F. Circuit Court Proceedings 
After the Final Award affirming the Interim Award and 
awarding CRX and Knox Hoversland Architects, Ltd. (KHA) 
attorneys' fees and costs was issued, CRX moved to confirm the 
Final Award in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit 
Court), and KHA joined. AOAO moved to vacate the Final Award. 
During arguments before the Circuit Court regarding 
whether an evidentiary hearing was necessary, Attorney Revere 
claimed he did not hear Attorney Juliano's statement at the pre-arbitration conference, "I won't say that's not true. It could have happened before I got in the room. It could have happened some other time, but I'm telling you, I never heard that[.]" 
At a status conference, "all counsel agreed that no 
evidentiary hearing would be necessary to dispose of the consolidated motions[.]" The parties submitted seventy-five 
24 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
joint exhibits to the Circuit Court. 
Among these exhibits was a 
declaration by Attorney Juliano, in which he described his May 1, 
2014 statement at the pre-arbitration conference: 
I specifically brought up with Judge Amano in front of
counsel the fact that my partner, Mr. Inouye, and associate,Mr. Kopper, were before her the day prior on April 30, 2014arguing their MSJ in the other unrelated arbitrationproceeding. In particular, I inquired as to whetherMr. Kopper argued the motion. 
Parties made their final arguments; the Circuit Court 
granted AOAO's motions to vacate, and denied CRX and KHA's motion 
to confirm. The Circuit Court made the following pertinent findings regarding Arbitrator's disclosure and Attorney Juliano's statement prior to the arbitration proceeding: 
17. On November 18, 2013, Judge Amano, through Kelly
Bryant, Case Manager at DPR, provided the following
disclosure by email addressed to Attorneys Revere andJuliano: 
I know counsels Terry Revere, Cid Inouye andJeff Juliano, and I have worked with otherlawyers in their respective law firms, in mycapacity as a former state court judge between1992-2003 or in my post-retirement years as anarbitrator or mediator with DPR; I do not knowMalia Nickison-Beazley. 
I have no other professional, social or personal
interactions with anyone involved in this case. 
There are no relationships or interests, past or
present[,] that would affect my neutrality as anarbitrator in this case. 
Joint Exh. 2. 
18. In the same email, Ms. Bryant advised that: 
The Judge has made a diligent effort to discloseall relevant matters. If any party hasadditional information that should be disclosed but has not been, or you have any comments orobjections, please submit them in writing to DPRby November 21, 2013. (Emphasis in original.) 
Id. 
19. Ms. Bryant copied Attorney Inouye (O'Connor
Playdon), Alison Shigekuni, Esq. (O'Connor Playdon), MeaMitchell, Esq. (Revere & Associates), and AttorneyNickison-Beazley (Revere & Associates) on the November 18,
2013 email containing Judge Amano's initial disclosure. Id. 
25  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
20. No party submitted comment or objection to
Judge Amano serving as arbitrator in response to her
November 18, 2013 initial disclosure. 
. . . . 
28. On May 1, 2014, counsel for all the parties
herein attended a pre-arbitration conference before JudgeAmano at DPR's office. Joint Exh. 1, Juliano Decl.[paragraph] 5. 
29. At said pre-arbitration conference, Attorney
Juliano disclosed that Attorneys Inouye and Maxwell K.Kopper (previously an associate at O'Connor Playdon) werebefore Judge Amano the day before, April 30, 2014, arguing
an unrelated motion for summary judgment. Id. 
30. In said unrelated matter, unbeknownst to
Claimant, Ms. Bryant had confirmed on November 6, 2013, that
Judge Amano was selected as the arbitrator, eight daysbefore Judge Amano was selected as arbitrator in thismatter. 
31. There was no objection made at the May 1, 2014
pre-arbitration conference with respect to Judge Amanoserving as arbitrator in this matter. 
No party challenged these findings pursuant to Hawai# i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(4)(C). 
These findings are thus 
binding on this Court. State v. Torres, 125 Hawai# i 382, 388, 
262 P.3d 1006, 1012 (2011).  CRX and KHA appealed to this Court. 
II.
 DISCUSSION 
HRS § 658A-12 provides, in relevant part, as follows: 
(c) If an arbitrator discloses a fact required by
subsection (a) or (b) to be disclosed and a party timelyobjects to the appointment or continued service of thearbitrator based upon the fact disclosed, the objection maybe a ground under section 658A-23(a)(2) for vacating anaward made by the arbitrator. 
(d) If the arbitrator did not disclose a fact as required by
subsection (a) or (b), upon timely objection by a party, the court
under section 658A-23(a)(2) may vacate an award. 
HRS § 658A-12(c) and (d) (2016) (formatting altered and emphases 
added). The well accepted rule in arbitration cases is that a party who "fails to raise a claim of partiality [against an arbitrator] prior to or during the arbitration proceeding is deemed to have waived the right to challenge the decision based on evident partiality." Nordic PCL Constr., Inc. v. LPIHGC, LLC, 
26 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
136 Hawai# i 29, 52, 358 P.3d 1, 24 (2015) (citation and internal 
quotation marks omitted, emphasis added). 
Further, "[i]t is well settled that the legislature 
overwhelmingly favors arbitration as a means of dispute 
resolution." Tatibouet v. Ellsworth, 99 Hawai# i 226, 234, 54 
P.3d 397, 405 (2002). 
Given this policy favoring the finality of 
arbitration awards, Hawai# i courts embrace the principle of 
waiver in order to discourage parties from adopting the "wait and see" approach to challenging the arbitration decision based on information they had or could have ascertained by more thorough inquiry. See Nordic, 136 Hawai# i at 53, 358 P.3d at 25. 
Here, in addition to having actual knowledge of 
Arbitrator's professional relationship with Attorney Inouye in her capacity as an arbitrator and mediator with DPR, a reasonable inference from the Circuit Court's unchallenged findings is that AOAO had knowledge of Attorney Inouye appearing before Arbitrator in an unrelated matter. The Circuit Court found that all parties attended the pre-arbitration conference, and there, Attorney Juliano disclosed that Attorney Inouye appeared before Arbitrator in an unrelated matter the day prior. See Daiichi Hawai# i Real 
Estate Corp. v. Lichter, 103 Hawai# i 325, 346-48, 82 P.3d 411, 
432-34 (2003). See also Black's Law Dictionary 1043 (11th ed. 
2019) (defining constructive knowledge as "[k]nowledge that one using reasonable care or diligence should have"). 
Although Attorney Revere, during a hearing on the 
necessity of an evidentiary hearing, asserted to the Circuit Court that he did not hear Attorney Juliano's disclosure, that assertion was argument, not evidence. State v. Quitog
, 85 
27 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawai
#i 128, 144, 938 P.2d 559, 575 (1997) ("[I]t is axiomatic 
that the arguments of counsel are not evidence.") (citation and 
internal quotation marks omitted). Notably, Attorney Revere did not provide a declaration to that effect in the joint exhibits comprising the stipulated record, did not make similar assertions regarding his co-counsel who appears to have participated significantly in this case, and stipulated that an evidentiary hearing was unnecessary. 
In sum, the Interim Award was issued ten months after 
Arbitrator disclosed knowing Attorney Inouye in her capacity as an arbitrator with DPR, and four months after Attorney Juliano stated at the pre-arbitration conference that Attorney Inouye appeared before Arbitrator in an unrelated matter. During that time, AOAO did not comment on, or object to, Arbitrator's ability to be a neutral arbitrator. See Nordic, 136 Hawai# i at 52, 358 
P.3d at 24 (explaining that "a party who has actual or constructive knowledge of a relationship of the arbitrator requiring disclosure but fails to raise a claim of partiality prior to or during the arbitration proceeding is deemed to have waived the right to challenge the decision based on evident partiality.") (cleaned up and emphasis added). Instead, AOAO employed a "wait and see" strategy, requesting more information and challenging Arbitrator's neutrality only after the Interim Award did not go its way. 
III. CONCLUSION 
Therefore, I would hold that AOAO waived its right to 
challenge the Arbitrator on the ground of evident partiality because its objection was untimely, and that the Circuit Court 
28 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
abused its discretion in vacating the Final Award. See id., 136 
Hawai#i at 53, 358 P.3d at 25 (explaining that "[a]ny such ruling 
of the circuit court under HRS [§]658A-12(d) will be reviewed 
under an abuse of discretion standard").
