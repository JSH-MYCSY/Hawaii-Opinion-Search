APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 14-1-1759-08 (JHC))

 
ORDER GRANTING MAY 25, 2017 MOTION TO DISMISS APPELLATE COURT
CASE NUMBER CAAP-17-0000164 FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION

 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) Defendants/Counterclaim-Plaintiffs/
 
Appellants Woolsey Eaton Kaenauilani Rice and Patricia Maile
 
Rice's (the Appellants) May 25, 2017 motion to dismiss their
 appeal in appellate court case number CAAP-17-0000164, (2) the
 lack of any memorandum by any other party in response to the
 Appellants' May 25, 2017 motion to dismiss, and (3) the record,
 it appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction over the
 Appellants' appeal from the Honorable Jeannette H. Castagnetti's
 February 13, 2017 interlocutory "Order Granting in Part and
 Denying in Part Defendants Woolsey Eaton Kaenauilani Rice and
 
Patricia Maile Rice's Motion for Leave to File First Amended
 Counterclaim" (the February 13, 2017 interlocutory order),
 because the circuit court has not yet reduced any substantive
 rulings to a separate, appealable final judgment.
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 641-1(a) (2016) 
authorizes appeals to the Hawai
'i Intermediate Court of Appeals 
from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of 
Civil Procedure (HRCP) requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." Based on this requirement under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has held that 
"[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 
Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). "Thus, based on 
Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 
Hawai
'i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008); Bailey v. 
DuVauchelle, 135 Hawai 'i 482, 489, 353 P.3d 1024, 1031 (2015). 
Consequently, "[a]n appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Jenkins, 76 
Hawai
'i at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote omitted). 
On May 11, 2017, the circuit court clerk filed the
 
record on appeal for appellate court case number CAAP-17-0000164,
 which does not include a final judgment. Although exceptions to
 the final judgment requirement exist under the doctrine in Forgay
 v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848) (the Forgay doctrine), the
 collateral order doctrine, and HRS § 641-1(b) (2016), the
 February 13, 2017 interlocutory order does not satisfy the
 requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine, the
 
2
 collateral order doctrine, or HRS § 641-1(b). See Ciesla v. 
Reddish, 78 Hawai 'i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) (regarding 
the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay 
doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai 'i 
319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding the three requirements for the collateral order doctrine); HRS § 641-1(b) (regarding the requirements for an appeal from an interlocutory order). Absent an appealable final judgment, we lack appellate jurisdiction over appellate court case number CAAP-17-0000164 and the Appellants' appeal is premature. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Appellants'
 
May 25, 2017 motion to dismiss their appeal in appellate court
 case number CAAP-17-0000164 is granted, without prejudice to any
 party seeking appellate review of the February 13, 2017
 interlocutory order by way of a timely appeal from a future
 appealable final judgment. Appellate court case number 
CAAP-17-0000164 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
