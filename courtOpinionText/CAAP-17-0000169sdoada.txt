SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Ginoza, C.J., Fujise and Chan, JJ.)
Defendants-Appellants Bonnie I. Swink and Jack Swink
(collectively, the Swinks ) appeal from the Judgment entered on
February 14, 2017 by the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit
(circuit court).1  The Swinks also challenge the circuit court's
"Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting
Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure
Against All Defendants on Complaint filed December 9, 2014" also
entered on February 14, 2017.  The Judgment and challenged order

On appeal, the Swinks contend that the circuit court
erred in concluding: (1) that US Bank had standing to foreclose;
(2) that US Bank had met its evidentiary burden for summary
judgment; and (3) that the Swinks had failed to present
sufficient affirmative defenses.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
well as the relevant legal authorities, we resolve the Swinks'
points of error as follows, and we vacate and remand.
The Hawaii Supreme Court's opinion in Bank of America,
N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai #i 361, 390 P.3d 1248 (2017) is
dispositive in this appeal.  In Reyes-Toledo, the supreme court
held in a judicial foreclosure action that in order to establish
a right to foreclose, the foreclosing plaintiff must establish
standing, or entitlement to enforce the subject note, at the time
the action was commenced. Id.  at 367-70, 390 P.3d at 1254-57.#
Reyes-Toledo notes that a foreclosing plaintiff must
typically "prove the existence of an agreement, the terms of the
agreement, a default by the mortgagor under the terms of the
agreement, and giving of the cancellation notice."  Id.  at 367,
390 P.3d at 1254 (citing Bank of Honolulu, N.A. v. Anderson , 3
Haw. App. 545, 551, 654 P.2d 1370, 1375 (1982)).  Furthermore,
"[a] foreclosing plaintiff must also prove its entitlement to
enforce the note and mortgage."  Id.  The supreme court then
expressed that "[a] foreclosing plaintiff's burden to prove
entitlement to enforce the note overlaps with the requirements of
standing in foreclosure actions as 'standing is concerned with
whether the parties have the right to bring suit.'"  Id.
(brackets omitted) (quoting Mottl v. Miyahira , 95 Hawai #i 381,
388, 23 P.3d 716, 723 (2001)).  Because "standing relates to the
invocation of the court's jurisdiction, it is not surprising that
standing must be present at the commencement of the case." 
Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai# i at 368, 390 P.3d at 1255.  Thus, a
foreclosing plaintiff must establish entitlement to enforce the
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
note and standing to foreclose on the mortgaged property at the
commencement of the suit.  Id.
Like the foreclosing bank in Reyes Toledo, US Bank was
granted a decree of foreclosure by way of a summary judgment
ruling.  In support of its summary judgment motion, US Bank
attached, inter alia , three documents to demonstrate that it
possessed the subject Initial Interest Note ( Note): (1) a
"Declaration of Indebtedness" by Denean Stroman ( Stroman
Declaration), an employee of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. ( Wells Fargo
Bank), executed on March 30, 2016, attesting that "[US Bank] is
in possession of the Promissory Note" (emphasis added); (2) a
copy of the Note attached as an exhibit to the Stroman
Declaration, which shows that Wells Fargo Home Mortgage of
Hawaii, LLC (Wells Fargo Home) was the lender for the Note, the
Note contains an undated special endorsement from Wells Fargo
Home to Wells Fargo Bank, and the Note also contains an undated
blank endorsement by Wells Fargo Bank; and (3) a "Certification
of Possession of Original Promissory Note" (Certification of
Possession ) by Kari Jo Jo Dunham ( Dunham), designated as exhibit
"K" to the summary judgment motion, which does not show an
attestation date but attests that Wells Fargo Bank is the
"servicer" for US Bank, that on June 9, 2014, Dunham personally
reviewed the original Note at a location in Minnesota, and that
"[Wells Fargo Bank] has possession of the Note."  Like in Reyes-
Toledo, this evidence fails to demonstrate that US Bank had
possession of the Note at the time it filed the Complaint on
December 9, 2014.
In sum, there is no evidence in the record to establish
US Bank's entitlement to enforce the Note when it commenced this
action.2  Specifically, there is no admissible evidence
2  The Complaint alleged, inter alia , that the Note was endorsed in
blank and that US Bank "is now the holder of the Note and is entitled to
enforce it pursuant to HRS ยง 490:3-301."  Further, a copy of the Note was
attached to the Complaint, and US Bank submitted an attorney affirmation with
its Complaint.  However, it appears that in Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v.
Behrendt, SCAP-16-0000645, 2018 WL 1325153 (Haw. Mar. 15, 2018), the Hawai #i
Supreme Court implicitly did not give any evidentiary merit to an attorney
affirmation in the record in that case.  See also Wilmington Sav. Fund Soc'y,
FSB v. Yasuda, No. CAAP-17-0000433, 2018 WL 1904909 (Hawai #i App. Apr. 23,
2018) (Ginoza, J., concurring). 
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
establishing that US Bank was in possession of the blank endorsed
Note at the time the Complaint was filed.3
Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the
Swinks, as we must for purposes of a summary judgment ruling,
there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether US Bank
was entitled to enforce the subject Note at the time this
foreclosure action was commenced.  Therefore, pursuant
to Reyes-Toledo , the circuit court erred in granting US Banks'
motion for summary judgment. 
Given the above, we need not address the Swinks'
remaining point on appeal.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED  that the following,
both entered by the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit on
February 14, 2017, are vacated: (1) the "Findings of Fact,
Conclusions of Law and Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for
Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure Against All Defendants
on Complaint"; and (2) the Judgment.  This case is remanded to
the circuit court for further proceedings.

3  Because the Stroman Delcaration and Dunham's Certification of
Possession do not state that US Bank had possession of the Note at the time
the Complaint was filed on December 9, 2014, we need not address whether the
declaration or certification are appropriate to authenticate the pertinent
records under U.S. Bank N.A. v. Mattos, 140 Hawai #i 26, 398 P.3d 615 (2017).
