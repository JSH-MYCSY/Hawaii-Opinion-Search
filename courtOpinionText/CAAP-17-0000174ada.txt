Defendant/Counterclaim Plaintiff-Appellant Mary Lee
Colton (Colton ) appeals from the judgment entered on February 10,
2017, by the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit ( Circuit Court)
pursuant to Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 54(b)1/
1/The Honorable Melvin H. Fujino presided.FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(February 10, 2017 Judgment ).  Judgment was entered in favor of
Plaintiff/Counterclaim Defendant-Appellee The Bank of New York
Mellon, as Trustee for the Certificateholders of CWABS Inc.,
Asset-Backed Certificates, Series 2007-11 ( BONY), and against
Colton, dismissing all of her counterclaims.  2/
Colton contends, among other things, that the Circuit
Court abused its discretion in granting BONY's motion for
sanctions, thereby dismissing Colton's counterclaims with
prejudice, on the ground that she failed to comply with the
Circuit Court's prior order to compel her responses to BONY's
written discovery requests.3/
After reviewing the record on appeal and the relevant
legal authorities, and giving due consideration to the issues
raised and the arguments advanced by the parties, we resolve
Colton's contentions as follows and vacate and remand.
I.  BACKGROUND
On February 1, 2013, BONY filed a complaint seeking to
foreclose on a note and mortgage allegedly made by Colton
(Foreclosure Complaint ).  In response, on July 15, 2013, Colton
filed a counterclaim against BONY ( Counterclaim) asserting the
following eight "counts," which we also refer to as
2/Colton filed the notice of appeal, as well as her opening and
reply briefs, pro se.  After briefing was completed, and this court ordered
that no oral argument would be heard, counsel for Colton gave notice of their
appearance and filed a motion for retention of oral argument.  The motion was
granted and oral argument was heard on February 12, 2020. 
3/  Colton's relevant argument has been summarized and rewritten for
clarity.  We note that her opening and reply briefs do not comply with Hawai #i
Rules of Appellate Procedure ( HRAP) Rule 28 in material respects.  However:
[T]he Hawai #i appellate courts have "consistently adhered to
the policy of affording litigants the opportunity 'to have
their cases heard on the merits, where possible.'"  Morgan
v. Planning Dep't, 104 Hawai #i 173, 180–81, 86 P.3d 982,
989–90 (2004) (quoting O'Connor v. Diocese of Honolulu, 77
Hawai#i 383, 386, 885 P.2d 361, 364 (1994)).  Moreover,
Hawai#i appellate courts generally are more forgiving of
technical flaws in pro se parties' briefs.  See, e.g.,
Wagner v. World Botanical Gardens, Inc., 126 Hawai #i 190,
193, 268 P.3d 443, 446 (App. 2011). 
State v. Cormier, No. CAAP-13-0004623, 2015 WL 6126948, at *1 n.3 (Haw. App.
Oct. 16, 2015).  Although BONY points out Colton's failure to comply with HRAP
Rule 28, BONY does not argue that Colton's failure prejudiced it.  We
therefore address her discernible argument.

"counterclaims": 
COUNT I
Absence of identity of parties of interest and supporting
documents whom give authority to foreclosing party taking
action.
COUNT II
Unlawful broker solicitation based on false representation
regarding credit at origin of said transaction.
COUNT III
Deceptive trade practices, engaged in confusing and
misunderstanding conduct.
COUNT IV
Fraud and false assignment of mortgage.
COUNT V
Knowingly participate and collaborate with third party fees
and collection of.
COUNT VI
Forced placed insurance.
COUNT VII
Breach of contract.
COUNT VIII
Common law fraud.
It appears that the counterclaims were all based on the same
factual allegations and concerned issues involving the
foreclosure.  4/
Following Colton's action, BONY filed a motion to
dismiss the Counterclaim on August 9, 2013, and a motion for
summary judgment on the Foreclosure Complaint on November 13,
2013.
On March 6, 2014, the Circuit Court entered its order
granting in part and denying in part BONY's motion to dismiss the
Counterclaim ( March 6, 2014 Order), which granted the motion as
to Counts IV, VI, and VIII, and denied the motion as to Counts I,
4/The counterclaims are difficult to discern, but their legal
sufficiency is not at issue in this appeal.  At oral argument, Colton's
counsel stated that the counterclaims "went to the underpinnings of what
authority [BONY] had to foreclose on her" and "[went] to the heart of the
initiation of the foreclosure itself . . . of the loan itself[.]"
3FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
II, III, V, and VII ( Remaining Counterclaims).
On July 8, 2014, the Circuit Court entered its
"Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, [and] Order Granting
[BONY's] Motion for Summary Judgment Against All Parties and For
Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure Filed November 13, 2013"
(Foreclosure Decree), and the related Judgment ( Foreclosure
Judgment ).  On July 18, 2014, Colton filed her notice of appeal
from the Foreclosure Judgment, which initiated appellate court
case number CAAP-14-0000984.  See The Bank of New York Mellon v.
Colton (Colton I), No. CAAP-14-0000984, 2017 WL 3587949 (Haw.
App. Aug. 21, 2017).
Meanwhile, on July 9, 2014, BONY served Colton with its
first request for production of documents, first request for
answers to interrogatories, and first request for admissions
(Discovery Requests).  Colton failed to respond to the Discovery
Requests, and on August 14, 2015, after an unsuccessful attempt
to meet and confer, BONY filed a motion to compel Colton's
responses.
On November 10, 2015, the Circuit Court entered its
order granting BONY's motion to compel ( November 10, 2015 Order).
The November 10, 2015 Order required Colton to provide written
responses to the Discovery Requests within 30 days, and deemed
all of the Requests for Admissions admitted.
Following Colton's further failure to provide responses
to the Discovery Requests, on May 27, 2016, BONY filed a motion
for sanctions for failure to comply with the November 10, 2015
Order.  The motion sought dismissal of Colton's counterclaims
with prejudice.  Colton failed to file a timely opposition to the
motion, though she eventually filed an "objection," arguing in
essence that the Foreclosure Complaint should have been dismissed
and that discovery should not have been permitted after entry of
the Foreclosure Judgment.
On August 1, 2016, the Circuit Court entered its order
granting BONY's motion for sanctions and dismissing all of
Colton's counterclaims "in their entirety with prejudice"
(August 1, 2016 Order ).  Colton filed an "objection" and motion
for reconsideration of the August 1, 2016 Order, which the
4FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Circuit Court denied on September 16, 2016.
On February 10, 2017, the Circuit Court entered its
order granting BONY's motion for certification pursuant to HRCP
Rule 54(b), and the February 10, 2017 Judgment.  On March 13,
2017, Colton filed her notice of appeal from the February 10,
2017 Judgment, which initiated this appeal.
On August 21, 2017, this court issued its Summary
Disposition Order in Colton I, 2017 WL 3587949, at *1, which
vacated the Foreclosure Judgment and remanded the case to the
Circuit Court for further proceedings.
II. DISCUSSION
In Bank of America, N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai#i
361, 390 P.3d 1248 (2017), the Hawai#i Supreme Court held that a
judgment entered on a decree of foreclosure is final and
appealable pursuant to HRS § 667-51(a) and § 641-1.  Id. at 371-
72, 390 P.3d at 1258-59.  Thus, an appeal from such a judgment
brings up for review "all interlocutory orders not appealable
directly as of right which deal with issues in the case."  Id. at
372, 390 P.3d at 1259 (quoting Ueoka v. Szymanski, 107 Hawai#i
386, 396, 114 P.3d 892, 902 (2005)).  The defendant-homeowner's
appeal in Reyes-Toledo therefore brought up for review the
circuit court's orders concerning the dismissal of the defendant-
homeowner's counterclaims, which were issued prior to the
foreclosure decree and "concerned issues involving the
foreclosure in [that] case."  Id. at 372, 390 P.3d at 1259.  The
circuit court's description of its foreclosure decree as
interlocutory, and the judgment's explanation that the
foreclosure decree was "entered 'as a final judgment . . . as
there was no just reason for delay pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b)'"
had no bearing on whether the judgment was a final, appealable
judgment that would allow review of other interlocutory orders. 
Id. at 366, 373, 390 P.3d at 1253, 1260 (brackets omitted).
Similarly, here, the Foreclosure Judgment was itself a
final, appealable judgment pursuant to HRS § 667-51(a) and § 641-
1.  This was so, regardless of the Circuit Court's description of
the Foreclosure Decree as interlocutory, and the Foreclosure
5FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Judgment's statement that the Foreclosure Decree was "entered as
a final judgment . . . as there [was] no just reason for delay
pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the [HRCP]."  Colton's appeal from the
Foreclosure Judgment thus brought up for review all interlocutory
orders not appealable directly as of right which dealt with
issues in the case.  Indeed, Colton's notice of appeal asserted,
among other things, that the Circuit Court erred in its ruling
"with respect to . . . [Colton's] counterclaims."  Like the
orders concerning the dismissal of the defendant-homeowner's
counterclaims in Reyes-Toledo, the March 6, 2014 Order – which
dismissed Counts IV, VI and VIII of the Counterclaim – was issued
prior to the Foreclosure Decree and "concerned issues involving
the foreclosure."  Id. at 372, 390 P.3d at 1259.  Accordingly,
Colton's appeal from the Foreclosure Judgment brought up for
review the March 6, 2014 Order.
"'Generally, the filing of a notice of appeal divests
the trial court of jurisdiction over the appealed case.' 
However, 'notwithstanding the general effect of the filing of a
notice of appeal, the trial court retains jurisdiction to
determine matters collateral or incidental to the judgment[.]'" 
Central Pacific Bank v. Metcalfe, CAAP-14-0000851, 2015 WL
3549997, at *1 (Haw. App. June 4, 2015) (SDO) (quoting TSA Int'l,
Ltd. v. Shimizu Corp., 92 Hawai#i 243, 265, 990 P.2d 713, 735
(1999)).
 Here, the Remaining Counterclaims were not dismissed
prior to entry of the Foreclosure Judgment.  It appears that
those Remaining Counterclaims, although difficult to discern,
were not collateral or incidental to the Foreclosure Judgment. 
Rather, the Remaining Counterclaims – like Counts IV, VI and VIII
– were all based on the same set of factual allegations and
concerned issues involving the foreclosure.  See supra note 4. 
The Counterclaim's prayer for relief seeks damages, as well as
declaratory and injunctive relief.   At oral argument, Colton's
counsel stated that "most of that is . . . in seeking damages,"5/
5/Colton styled her pleading as a "Counterclaim; Motion for
Extension of Time; Motion to Dismiss."  Her prayer for relief also
"request[ed] that the Court dismiss claims by [BONY.]" 
6FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
though he also inferred that "the injunctive relief was to stay
the foreclosure proceeding itself."      
We take judicial notice of the fact that the
counterclaims in Reyes-Toledo – for wrongful foreclosure,
declaratory relief, quiet title, and unfair and deceptive trade
practices – sought both damages and equitable relief.  See Answer
and Countercl. of Def. Grisel Reyes-Toledo at 5-8, Bank of
America, N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, No. 1CC121000668 (Haw. 1st Cir.
Ct. Sept. 28, 2012).  For example, the counterclaim for wrongful
foreclosure concluded with the allegation that "Defendant has
been damaged in an amount to be proven at trial, for general,
special, and punitive damages in an amount to vest this Court
with jurisdiction."  Id. at 6.  The fact that the defendant-
homeowner in Reyes-Toledo sought damages as a remedy did not
affect the supreme court's conclusion that all of the
counterclaims "concerned issues involving the foreclosure."  139
Hawai#i at 372, 390 P.3d at 1259. 
Likewise, here, we conclude that the nature of the
relief sought in Colton's counterclaims does not change their
gravamen, which is based on a common set of factual allegations 
that concern issues involving the foreclosure.  The Remaining
Counterclaims appear to be closely related to, not collateral or
incidental to, the Foreclosure Judgment.  Accordingly, Colton's
prior appeal from the Foreclosure Judgment divested the Circuit
Court of jurisdiction over all of the counterclaims, at least
until No. CAAP-14-0000984 was resolved and the case was remanded. 
Lacking jurisdiction over the counterclaims, the Circuit Court
abused its discretion in dismissing them "in their entirety with
prejudice," pursuant to the August 1, 2016 Order and the
February 10, 2017 Judgment.
III.  CONCLUSION
For these reasons, we vacate:  (1) the August 1, 2016
order granting BONY's motion for sanctions for failure to comply
with the November 10, 2015 Order; and (2) the February 10, 2017
HRCP Rule 54(b) judgment, both entered in the Circuit Court of

the Third Circuit.  This case is remanded to the Circuit Court
for further proceedings.
