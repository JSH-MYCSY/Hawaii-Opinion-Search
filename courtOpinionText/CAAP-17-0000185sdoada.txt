SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
In this action for judicial foreclosure, Intervenor-
third-party Defendant/Appellant Chun Mei Tong, Trustee of the
unrecorded Akuli Family Trust dated July 11, 2014 ( Tong), appeals
from a "Judgment on Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for
Confirmation of Sale by Commissioner" ( Judgment Confirming Sale )

Confirmation of Sale by Commissioner" (Order Confirming Sale ),NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
both entered on February 22, 2017 by the Circuit Court of the
First Circuit ( circuit court) in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee U.S.
Bank National Association, as Trustee for the Structured Asset
Investment Loan Trust, 2005-HE3 (U.S. Bank ).1
Tong's sole point of error on appeal is that the
circuit court erred in denying her Hawai#i Rules of Civil
Procedure ( HRCP) Rule 60(b) Motion for Relief, from which she did
not timely appeal, and in entering its Judgment Confirming Sale
because U.S. Bank did not establish its standing to foreclose and
thus the circuit court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction.
For the reasons discussed below, we affirm. 
U.S. Bank initiated this judicial foreclosure action
against, inter alia , Rick Kealoha Pa, Jr. on January 21, 2009. 
On June 22, 2009, the circuit court granted U.S. Bank's Ex Parte
Motion to identify Mililani Town Association as defendant Doe
Entity 1.  Mililani Town Association was served with the
complaint on or around April 7, 2011.  Tong was not named as a
defendant in U.S. Bank's complaint.  On August 26, 2014, U.S.
Bank filed a motion for summary judgment and decree of
foreclosure against all defendants.  On January 22, 2015, the
circuit court entered its "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law
and Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and
Decree of Foreclosure Against All Defendants" (Order Granting
U.S. Bank's MSJ ) and corresponding "Judgment on Findings of Fact,
Conclusions of Law and Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for
Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure against All
Defendants" (Foreclosure Judgment) in favor of U.S. Bank. No
party appealed from the Foreclosure Judgment and thus the
Foreclosure Judgment became final and binding.  See Mortg. Elec.
Registration Sys., Inc. v. Wise, 130 Hawai# i 11, 17, 304 P.3d
1192, 1198 (2013).
On February 27, 2015, more than one month after the
circuit court entered its Foreclosure Judgment, Tong filed a
1  The Honorable Bert I. Ayabe presided.
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
motion to intervene in this case as a third-party defendant. 
Tong asserted that she became the record title holder to the
property by way of a quitclaim deed executed on July 29, 2014 by
Defendant Mililani Town Association.   Tong requested leave to
intervene so that she could file a motion to reconsider the Order
Granting U.S. Bank's MSJ and Foreclosure Judgment.  On June 16,
2015, the circuit court entered an order granting Tong's motion
to intervene.2
 On August 12, 2015, Tong filed her HRCP Rule 60(b)
Motion for Relief from the Order Granting U.S. Bank's MSJ and
Foreclosure Judgment.  In her motion, Tong asserted, inter alia,
that the circuit court's Foreclosure Judgment was void under HRCP
Rule 60(b)(4) because U.S. Bank had failed to establish its
standing to invoke the court's jurisdiction.  On February 12,
2016, the circuit court entered an order denying Tong's HRCP Rule
60(b) Motion for Relief ( Rule 60(b) Order ).  Tong did not appeal
from this order.  
On November 10, 2016, U.S. Bank filed "Plaintiff's
Motion for Confirmation of Sale by Commissioner" ( Motion for
Confirmation of Sale ).  On January 4, 2017, Tong filed her
opposition to U.S. Bank's Motion For Confirmation of Sale, again
arguing, inter alia , that U.S. Bank had failed to establish its
standing to invoke the circuit court's jurisdiction.  On February
22, 2017, the circuit court entered its Order Confirming Sale and
the corresponding judgment.  This appeal follows.
I. This Court lacks appellate jurisdiction to review the
circuit court's Rule 60(b) Order
We lack appellate jurisdiction to review Tong's point
of error as it pertains to the circuit court's Rule 60(b) Order. 
The circuit court entered this order on February 12, 2016. 
Tong's HRCP Rule 60(b) Motion for Relief specifically sought
2  It appears from the record that Tong purchased the property from
Defendant Mililani Town Association at a public sale conducted on July 11,
2014.  Mililani Town Association had apparently conducted the power of sale
foreclosure because Pa had failed to pay assessments that were due. 
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
relief pertaining to the Foreclosure Judgment and thus the
circuit court's Rule 60(b) Order was a final, appealable order. 
See Beneficial Hawaii, Inc. v. Casey, 98 Hawai#i 159, 165, 45
P.3d 359, 365 (2002) (holding that when an "HRCP Rule 60(b)
motion pertain[s] exclusively to a foreclosure decree[,]
seek[ing] to relieve the movant of its effect . . . the circuit
court's entry of judgment disposing of such [an] HRCP Rule 60(b)
motion is a final, appealable order.").  In order to obtain
appellate review, Tong was required to file a timely notice of
appeal from the Rule 60(b) Order, which she failed to do.  We
thus do not have appellate jurisdiction to address Tong's point
of error to the extent that it challenges the Rule 60(b) Order.  3 
II. Tong is precluded from challenging U.S. Bank's standing in
this appeal of the Judgment Confirming Sale.
Although Tong appeals from the Judgment Confirming
Sale, she does not challenge any aspect of the proceedings
relating to the sale of the subject property.  Instead, Tong
solely contends that the circuit court erred in entering its
Order Confirming Sale and corresponding judgment because U.S.
Bank had failed to establish its standing to foreclosure under
Bank of America, N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai# i 361, 390 P.3d
1248 (2017).  However, the res judicata  effect of the Foreclosure
Judgment, from which no party appealed, precludes Tong from
challenging U.S. Bank's standing in this appeal.  See Wise, 130
Hawai#i at 16-17, 304 P.3d at 1197-98.  
In Wise, the Hawai# i Supreme Court explained that, in
foreclosure cases, the doctrine of res judicata precludes
foreclosure defendants from raising defenses at the confirmation
of sale proceedings that could have been raised in challenging

HRCP Rule 60(b)(4) to resurrect an argument that a mortgagee lacked standing.

the entry of a foreclosure judgment.  Id. at 17-18, 304 P.3d at
1198-99.  As explained in Wise:
[T]he foreclosure judgment determined the merits of the
controversy, rendering subsequent proceedings incident to
its enforcement . . . .  [W]e conclude that res judicata
would preclude Petitioners from challenging Respondent's
standing in their appeal from the order confirming sale,
despite the general proposition that a lack of standing may
be raised at any time.  Under the doctrine of res judicata ,
challenges to Respondent's standing were subsumed under the
foreclosure judgment, which had [become] final and binding. 
Id. at 17, 304 P.3d at 1198 (citation and internal quotation
marks and internal brackets omitted).
Here, no party appealed from the Foreclosure Judgment,
which thus became final and binding as to U.S. Bank's right to
foreclose on the subject property.  See id.  
We note that Tong was not granted leave to intervene in
the instant foreclosure action until after the circuit court had
entered its Foreclosure Judgment.  However, the record indicates
that Tong had notice of this action at the time she allegedly
executed the quitclaim deed, approximately six months before the
Foreclosure Judgment was entered.  The quitclaim deed from
Mililani Town Association to Tong was executed by both parties,
notarized, and included a property description specifically
referencing the Notice of Pendency of Action for this foreclosure
action.  Thus, Tong's receipt of Mililani Town Association's
interest was clearly made subject to this pending foreclosure
action.
In her motion to intervene, Tong attached and relied on
Mililani Town Association's quitclaim deed, which included all of
the aforementioned information, demonstrating that she had notice
of U.S. Bank's recorded interest in the property.  As such, the
record indicates that Tong was aware of the subject mortgage and
the instant foreclosure action at the time she allegedly executed
the quitclaim deed on July 29, 2014, which was before U.S. Bank
filed its motion for summary judgment on August 26, 2014, and
before the circuit court subsequently entered its Foreclosure
Judgment on January 22, 2015.  Despite this, Tong did not move to
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
intervene in this foreclosure action until February 27, 2015,
after the Foreclosure Judgment had became final and binding. 
Tong is precluded from now challenging U.S. Bank's standing in
this appeal from the Judgment Confirming Sale.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Circuit Court
of the First Circuit's "Judgment on Order Granting Plaintiff's
Motion for Confirmation of Sale by Commissioner", entered on
February 22, 2017, is affirmed.
