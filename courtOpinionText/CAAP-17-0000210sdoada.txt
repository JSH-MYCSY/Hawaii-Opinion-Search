STATE OF HAWAI #I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
RODNEY HOPU, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CR. NO. 14-1-0147)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Fujise, Acting Chief Judge, Leonard and Chan, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Rodney Hopu (Hopu) appeals from the
February 23, 2017 "Order Denying [Hopu's] Motion For
Reconsideration of Sentence" (Order) entered by the Circuit Court
of the First Circuit1 (Circuit Court).  After entering a no-
contest plea, Hopu was convicted of Burglary in the Second Degree
(Burglary Two) in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
§ 708-811 (2014).2  Hopu was sentenced to a five-year term of
imprisonment including a mandatory minimum term of two years to
be served concurrently with any other term of imprisonment.
1The Honorable Sherri-Ann L. Iha presided over the Motion for
Reconsideration of Sentence.  The Honorable Dexter D. Del Rosario presided
over the taking of the plea and sentencing. 
2HRS § 708-811 provides:
(1) A person commits the offense of burglary in the second
degree if the person intentionally enters or remains
unlawfully in a building with intent to commit therein a
crime against a person or against property rights. 
(2) Burglary in the second degree is a class C felony.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
On appeal, Hopu claims the Circuit Court erred by
denying his Motion for Reconsideration of Sentence because his
sentence violated his right to due process where the charging
document did not state that he would be subject to enhanced
sentencing.
After reviewing the record on appeal and the relevant
legal authorities, and giving due consideration to the issues
raised and the arguments advanced by the parties, we resolve
Hopu's point on appeal as follows and affirm.
Hopu claims the Circuit Court erred by denying his
Motion for Reconsideration of Sentence because the Felony
Information with which he was charged, in violation of Fifth
Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I,
section 14 of the Hawai# i Constitution, failed to plead that he
would be subject to enhanced sentencing.  Hopu appears to argue
that due process required that the charging document expressly
state he would be subject to a mandatory minimum term of
imprisonment, the statutory basis for the minimum term, what the
minimum sentence would be, and the reasons--including prior
convictions--for the enhanced punishment.
The bulk of Hopu's argument relies on State v. Auld ,
136 Hawai# i 244, 245, 361 P.3d 471, 472 (2015).  However,
recognizing that new rules of law were being announced in that
case, the Auld court gave those rules "purely prospective effect,
which means that the rule is applied neither to the parties in
the law-making decision nor to those others against or by whom it
might be applied to conduct or events occurring before that
decision[.]"  Auld, 136 Hawai #i at 255, 361 P.3d at 482 (emphasis
added) (quoting State v. Jess , 117 Hawai #i 381, 401, 184 P.3d
133, 153 (2008)).  Hopu's Felony Information was filed on
February 4, 2014, and the Auld decision was filed on November 24,
2015.  Therefore, Auld does not apply to Hopu's case.
Hopu also argues that Hawaii case law prior to Auld
supports his argument that he was "entitled to have the mandatory
minimum enhancement allegations pled in the charging instrument
in this matter[,]" in particular, Jess, 117 Hawai #i at 398, 184
P.3d at 150.  In Jess, the Hawai# i Supreme Court held "that a#
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
charging instrument, be it an indictment, complaint, or
information, must include all 'allegations, which if proved,
would result in the application of a statute enhancing the
penalty of the crime committed.'"  117 Hawai #i at 398, 184 P.3d
at 150 (quoting State v. Apao , 59 Haw. 625, 636, 586 P.2d 250,
258 (1978) and citing State v. Estrada , 69 Haw. 204, 230, 738
P.2d 812, 829 (1987)).  However, prior to Auld, this requirement
had never been applied to allegations of prior convictions for
the purpose of imposing a mandatory minimum as a repeat offender
and the Auld  court's recognition that it was pronouncing a new
rule of law belies this claim.
Hopu also appears to argue that the Felony Information
was deficient for failing to specify that HRS § 706-606.5
(Supp. 2017) is the section under which Hopu would sentenced as a
repeat offender.  Again, published case law prior to Auld did not
make this a requirement.  In any event, this court has rejected
this claim in the past.  State v. Talamoa , 138 Hawai #i 137, 377
P.3d 1055, No. CAAP–15–0000153, 2016 WL 2941095 at *2 (App.
May 17, 2016) (SDO) (citing State v. Auld, 134 Hawai# i 475, 344
P.3d 359, No. CAAP–13–0002894, 2015 WL 356288 at *1 (App.
Jan. 27, 2015) (SDO), aff'd, 136 Hawai# i 244, 361 P.3d 471),
cert. denied SCWC-15-0000153, 2016 WL 4366800 (Aug. 15, 2016)
which held the pre-Auld authority did not require pleading the
possibility of repeat offender sentencing). 
The Hawai #i Supreme Court has expressly stated "[w]hile
due process does not require that notice be given prior to the
trial of the underlying offense, it does require that a defendant
to be sentenced under HRS § 706–606.5 be given reasonable notice
and afforded the opportunity to be heard."  Id. (internal
quotation marks omitted) (citing Auld, 2015 WL 356288 at *2
(quoting State v. Freitas , 61 Haw. 262, 602 P.2d 914 (1979))). 
Hopu's change of plea form and the transcript of his change of
plea reveal that he acknowledged he was subject to a mandatory
minimum term of imprisonment.  Hopu did not challenge the
applicability of repeat offender sentencing at his change of
plea, nor did he subsequently move to withdraw his plea
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
prior to or at sentencing.  On this record, Hopu was given notice
and opportunity to be heard on this issue.
For the foregoing reasons, the February 23, 2017 Order
Denying Defendant's Motion For Reconsideration of Sentence
entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, April 19, 2018.
