Appellants ), pro se, appeal from the (1) "Findings of Fact;
Conclusions of Law; Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary
Judgment and For Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure Against All
Parties Filed September 13, 2016," and (2) Judgment, both entered

2005-6 (USBNA), and against Appellants.
Appellants contend that the Circuit Court erred in
granting USBNA's motion for summary judgment ( MSJ), because,
among other things, USBNA: (1) "does not hold any mortgage or
note and . . . [was not] entitled to judgment as a matter of
law"; and (2) "did not have standing to file an action[.]"  2/
After reviewing the record on appeal and the relevant
legal authorities, and giving due consideration to the issues
raised and the arguments advanced by the parties, we resolve
Appellants' contentions as follows and vacate and remand.
In Bank of America, N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai#i
361, 390 P.3d 1248 (2017), the Hawai#i Supreme Court held that
to establish the right to foreclose, the foreclosing plaintiff
must establish standing, or entitlement to enforce the subject
promissory note, at the time the action was commenced.  Id. at
367-71, 390 P.3d at 1254-58.  The "foreclosing plaintiff's burden
to prove entitlement to enforce the note overlaps with the
requirements of standing in foreclosure actions as '[s]tanding is
concerned with whether the parties have the right to bring
suit.'"  Id. at 367, 390 P.3d at 1254 (quoting Mottl v. Miyahira,
95 Hawai#i 381, 388, 23 P.3d 716, 723 (2001)).  The supreme court
further noted that "a foreclosing plaintiff does not have
standing to foreclose on mortgaged property unless the plaintiff
was entitled to enforce the note that has been defaulted on." 
Id. at 368, 390 P.3d at 1255 (citing Hanalei, BRC Inc. v. Porter,
2/  Appellants' points of error have been restyled and condensed for
clarity.  We note that Appellants' opening and reply briefs do not comply with
Hawai#i Rules of Appellate Procedure ( HRAP) Rule 28 in material respects. 
However:
[T]he Hawai#i appellate courts have "consistently adhered to
the policy of affording litigants the opportunity 'to have
their cases heard on the merits, where possible.'"  Morgan
v. Planning Dep't, 104 Hawai#i 173, 180–81, 86 P.3d 982,
989–90 (2004) (quoting O'Connor v. Diocese of Honolulu, 77
Hawai#i 383, 386, 885 P.2d 361, 364 (1994)).  Moreover,
Hawai#i appellate courts generally are more forgiving of
technical flaws in pro se parties' briefs.  See, e.g.,
Wagner v. World Botanical Gardens, Inc., 126 Hawai#i 190,
193, 268 P.3d 443, 446 (App. 2011). 
State v. Cormier, No. CAAP-13-0004623, 2015 WL 6126948, at *1 n.3 (Haw. App.
Oct. 16, 2015).  USBNA points out Appellants' failure to comply with HRAP Rule
28, but does not contend that it suffered any resulting prejudice.  We
therefore address Appellants' discernible argument.
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
7 Haw. App. 304, 310, 760 P.2d 676, 680 (1988)).
Here, the Circuit Court granted USBNA's MSJ and entered
a decree of foreclosure based in part on two documents submitted
with the MSJ:  (1) a Declaration of Indebtedness ( Declaration ) by
Vanna D. Tipton ( Tipton), an employee of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.
(Wells Fargo), as servicing agent for USBNA, executed on July 22,
2016; and (2) the subject promissory note ( Note).  The
Declaration states, among other things, that Tipton is "familiar
with and regularly access[es] business records maintained by
Wells Fargo," and based on her review of those records, USBNA "is
in possession" of the Note, which "includes an Allonge [e]ndorsed
in blank."  The Note, attached to the Declaration as an exhibit,
does indeed appear to be endorsed in blank.
USBNA did not, however, present evidence to establish
its entitlement to enforce the Note at the time the foreclosure
action was commenced.  On April 24, 2014, USBNA filed a Complaint
for Foreclosure ( Complaint ), which states that USBNA "is the
holder of the Note and record assignee of the Mortgage."  The
Note was not attached to the Complaint, and there is no evidence
in the record that USBNA held the Note at the time the Complaint
was filed.  The Declaration and the Note itself, like their
counterparts in Reyes-Toledo, did not establish that fact.  See
id. at 370, 390 P.3d at 1257.  Similarly, the September 12, 2016
"Attorney Affirmation," which was submitted by USBNA's then-
counsel with the MSJ, also failed to establish that USBNA held
the Note when the Complaint was filed.
Absent evidence in the record that USBNA held the Note
when the Complaint was filed, there is a genuine issue as to
whether USBNA was entitled to foreclose at that time.  See 
Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai# i at 371, 390 P.3d at 1258.  Accordingly,
USBNA failed to satisfy its burden of demonstrating that it was
entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and the Circuit Court
erred in granting USBNA's MSJ.  See id.
We therefore vacate the (1) "Findings of Fact;
Conclusions of Law; Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary
Judgment and For Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure Against All
Parties Filed September 13, 2016," and (2) Judgment, both entered

The case is remanded to the Circuit Court for further proceedings
consistent with this Summary Disposition Order.
