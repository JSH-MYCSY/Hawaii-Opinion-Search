STATE OF HAWAI #I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
ROBERT A. BUKOSKI, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
(CASE NO. 5DTA-16-00016)
AMENDED MEMORANDUM OPINION
(By: Fujise, Acting C.J., and Reifurth and Chan, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Robert A. Bukoski appeals from two
Judgment/Order and Notice of Entry of Judgment/Order documents,
entered by the District Court of the Fifth Circuit ("District
Court"),1 on March 24, 2017.  The District Court convicted
Bukoski of two counts (Counts 2 and 3)2 of Inattention to Driving
1/The Honorable Jonathan Chun presided.
2/The Second Amended Complaint provides:
COUNT 2:  On or about the 12th day of August, 2015, in
the County of Kaua #i, State of Hawaii, [Bukoski] did
intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly  operate any vehicle
without due care or in a manner to cause collision with, or
injury to, to wit, Lawrence Asai, thereby committing the
offense of Inattention to Driving, a petty misdemeanor, in
violation of [HRS] Section 291-12.
COUNT 3:  On or about the 12th day of August, 2015, in
the County of Kaua #i, State of Hawaii, [Bukoski], did

("ITD"), in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") section
291-12.3
Bukoski argues that the District Court wrongly
convicted him (1) based on (a) insufficient evidence that he
possessed the requisite mens rea and (b) numerous clearly
erroneous findings of fact; (2) after erroneously denying his
motion for judgment of acquittal based on HRS section 701-
109(1)(e); and (3) where, in its closing argument, Plaintiff-
Appellee State of Hawai #i committed prosecutorial misconduct by
(a) improperly shifting the burden of proof to him and (b) mis-
characterizing the evidence.
I. BACKGROUND
The factual background, according to the District
Court's Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Verdict
Convicting Defendant of Inattention Offenses, entered on
February 2, 2017, is as follows in relevant part:
1. On Wednesday, August 12, 2015, around 10:39 a.m.,
[Caleb Jimenez], who was part of a street construction crew,
working on Hardy Street, a public road, in front of Wilcox
Elementary School, . . . observed [Bukoski] driving a . . .
truck exceeding the 15 mph speed limit, during school hours.
2. Jimenez saw [Bukoski] driving with his head down
through the vehicle's windows.
3. Jimenez witnessed [Bukoski] striking traffic
barricades, victim Lawrence Asai (hereinafter "Asai"), and
some construction equipment before coming to a stop.  On
cross-examination, Jimenez testified that the all [sic] of
these collisions took place within a few seconds.  Jimenez
testified that there was a flagman before the construction
2/(...continued)
intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly  operate any vehicle
without due care or in a manner to cause collision with, or
damage to, to wit, a traffic barrier, thereby committing the
offense of Inattention to Driving, a petty misdemeanor, in
violation of [HRS] Section 291-12.
(Emphasis in original.)
3/HRS section 291-12 (Supp. 2014) provides:
Whoever operates any vehicle without due care or in a
manner as to cause a collision with, or injury or damage to,
as the case may be, any person, vehicle or other property
shall be fined not more than $500 or imprisoned not more than
thirty days, or both, and may be subject to a surcharge of up
to $100 which shall be deposited into the trauma system
special fund.

zone manned by Artworks Construction.
4. Jimenez testified that he received traffic safety
training every Monday via weekly meetings, and that he was
trained to make eye-contact with vehicles that passed through
construction zones.
5. Jimenez saw Asai on the ground before medical
personnel arrived and took Asai away.
6. Jimenez testified that, immediately to the side of
the road where the accident occurred, there was a 1 to 2 foot
deep trench containing rebar.
7. Jimenez testified that he and [Bukoski] grew up
together and that they were like "family."
8. At the close of Jimenez's testimony, the State
rested and [Bukoski] moved for a Judgment of Acquittal, which
was denied by this Court, for reasons listed below.
9. Lieutenant Tanaka testified that he only brought
a copy of General Order 2001-03, Motor Vehicle Traffic
Investigation Procedures, which was later given to the State
and Defense on November 3, 2016.
10. As a witness called by [Bukoski], Officer Hanson
Hsu testified that he did not observe signs of impairment or
intoxication in [Bukoski] at the scene.  Officer Hsu further
testified that, on his Motor Vehicle Accident Report for the
incident, he did not mark the human factors of inattention,
distraction, aggressive, reckless driving, excessive speed,
driving too fast for conditions, or exceeding the speed limit
as causes of or factors contributing to the accident, but he
did mark "other improper action."  During his investigation,
he did not inspect the car for mechanical failure because he
is not trained in mechanics.  On cross, Hsu said that
[Bukoski] told Hsu that [Bukoski] was the driver.  [Bukoski]
also told Hsu that he had a health problem and took
medication.
11. As a witness for [Bukoski], Chelsea Carineo, who
works near the collision scene and arrived on the scene
approximately thirty minutes after it happened, testified that
the traffic barriers were not weighed down, that [Bukoski's]
vehicle had tinted windows, and that there were no flagmen
posted earlier that day when she drove to work, although there
were flagmen present at the site the following day.  She also
testified that the road was approximately 5-6 feet wide on the
day of the accident and that there was a 1-2 foot deep trench
immediately to the right of the road containing rebar.  On
cross, Carineo confirmed that the speed limit was 15[ ]mph and
that school was in session during the time of the incident. 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law
A trial court's findings of fact are reviewed under the
"clearly erroneous" standard of review.  Dan v. State, 76 Hawai #i
423, 428, 879 P.2d 528, 533 (1994) (citing Hawai#i Thousand
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Friends v. City and Cty. of Honolulu , 75 Haw 237, 248, 858 P.2d
726, 732 (1993)).  "A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when
(1) the record lacks substantial evidence to support the finding,
or (2) despite substantial evidence in support of the finding,
the appellate court is nonetheless left with a definite and firm
conviction that a mistake has been made."  State v. Locquiao, 100
Hawai#i 195, 203, 58 P.3d 1242, 1250 (2002) (quoting State v.
Harada, 98 Hawai #i 18, 22, 41 P.3d 174, 178 (2002)).
"An appellate court may freely review conclusions of
law and the applicable standard of review is the right/wrong
test.  A conclusion of law that is supported by the trial court's
findings of fact and that reflects an application of the correct
rule of law will not be overturned."  Dan , 76 Hawai #i at 428, 879
P.2d at 533 (citing and quoting Maria v. Freitas, 73 Haw. 266,
270, 271, 832 P.2d 259, 262, 263 (1992)) (internal quotation
marks omitted).
Sufficiency of the Evidence
[E]vidence adduced in the trial court must
be considered in the strongest light for the
prosecution when the appellate court passes on
the legal sufficiency of such evidence to support
a conviction; the same standard applies whether
the case was before a judge or jury. The test on
appeal is not whether guilt is established beyond
a reasonable doubt, but whether there was
substantial evidence to support the conclusion of
the trier of fact.
State v. Richie , 88 Hawai #i 19, 33, 960 P.2d 1227, 1241 (1998)
(quoting State v. Quitog , 85 Hawai #i 128, 145, 938 P.2d 559,
576 (1997)).  "'Substantial evidence' as to every material
element of the offense charged is credible evidence which is
of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person
of reasonable caution to support a conclusion." Richie, 88
Hawai#i at 33, 960 P.2d at 1241 (internal quotation marks and
citation omitted).
  T
he standard to be applied by the trial
court in ruling upon a motion for a judgment of
acquittal is whether, upon the evidence viewed in
the light most favorable to the prosecution and
in full recognition of the province of the trier
of fact, a reasonable mind might fairly conclude
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. An appellate
court employs the same standard of review.
State v. Keawe , 107 Hawai #i 1, 4, 108 P.3d 304, 307 (2005)
(brackets omitted) (quoting State v. Pone , 78 Hawai #i 262,
265, 892 P.2d 455, 458 (1995)).
State v. Bayly , 118 Hawai #i 1, 6, 185 P.3d 186, 191 (2008).
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Furthermore, "[m]atters related to the credibility of
witnesses and the weight to be given to the evidence are
generally left to the factfinder.  The appellate court will
neither reconcile conflicting evidence nor interfere with the
decision of the trier of fact based on the witnesses' credibility
or the weight of the evidence."  State v. Mitchell , 94 Hawai #i
388, 15 P.3d 314 (App. 2000) (citing State v. Gabrillo , 10 Haw.
App. 448, 457, 877 P.2d 891, 895 (1994)).
Judgment of Acquittal
"When reviewing a motion for judgment of acquittal,
[this court] employ[s] the same standard that a trial court
applies to such a motion, namely, whether, upon the evidence
viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution and in full
recognition of the province of the trier of fact, the evidence is
sufficient to support a prima facie case so that a reasonable
mind might fairly conclude guilt beyond a reasonable doubt." 
State v. Jenkins, 93 Hawai# i 87, 99, 997 P.2d 13, 25 (2000)
(quoting State v. Timoteo , 87 Hawai #i 108, 112-13, 952 P.2d 865,
869-70 (1997)).
Prosecutorial Misconduct
"Allegations of prosecutorial misconduct are reviewed
under the harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standard, which
requires an examination of the record and a determination of
whether there is a reasonable possibility that the error
complained of might have contributed to the conviction."  State
v. Rogan, 91 Hawai# i 405, 412, 984 P.2d 1231, 1238 (1999)
(quoting State v. Balisbisana , 83 Hawai #i 109, 114, 924 P.2d
1215, 1220 (1996)) (internal quotation marks omitted).
III. DISCUSSION
A. Findings of Fact ("FOFs")
We need not decide whether the FOFs that Bukoski
challenges are clearly erroneous because the other evidence,
taken in the light most favorable to the prosecution is
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
sufficient.  State v. Tsujimura, 140 Hawai# i 299, 307, 400 P.3d
500, 508 (2017); see, infra, Part III.B.
B. Sufficiency of the Evidence
Bukoski argues that there was insufficient evidence
that he possessed the requisite mens rea  to commit ITD.  To
support this point, Bukoski cites to State v. Moleta, 112 Hawai# i
233, 145 P.3d 776 (App. 2006), which concerns a conviction for
Reckless Driving, in violation of HRS section 291-2,4 but where
the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction because the
prosecution adduced no evidence of behavior or omissions by
defendant that would manifest his own awareness of any risk. 
Moleta is distinguishable, however, on the basis that Bukoski's
looking down and exceeding the speed limit are both behaviors
which the State adduced evidence concerning. 
Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the
State, as we must, the evidence was sufficient to support the
conviction.  
See Haw. Rev. Stat. §§ 291–12 and 702-206 (2014);
State v. Bayly , 118 Hawai #i 1, 10, 185 P.3d 186, 195 (2008)
(holding that to convict under HRS section 291-12, the
prosecution has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt
that defendant "(1) operated a vehicle 'without due care or in a
manner,' (conduct) (2) 'as to cause a collision with, or injury
or damage to, as the case may be, any person, vehicle or other
property' (result of conduct), HRS § 291-12, and that he did so
(3) intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly[.]").
Testimony and exhibits adduced at trial show that the
construction site was on the right side of Hardy Street.  Traffic
could proceed through the narrowed part of the road next to the
site.  Orange safety cones had been placed about two feet from
the site, into the road.  Construction barriers -- some white and
at least one orange with reflective material on it -- were near
the site.  The cones and barriers were visible to oncoming
traffic.
4/HRS section 291-2 provides, in part, "Whoever operates any vehicle
. . . recklessly in disregard of the safety of persons or property is guilty
of reckless driving of vehicle[.]"  Haw. Rev. Stat. § 291-2 (2007).
6NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Caleb Jimenez, a flagman trained to watch traffic in
construction zones for safety concerns, was positioned in front
of the library just before the site.  According to Jimenez, when
he first saw Bukoski on Hardy Street, Bukoski was driving
"[f]aster than the speed limit of the construction site."
According to the District Court's FOF 1, which is uncontested,
Jimenez "observed [Bukoski] . . . exceeding the 15 mph" school-
zone speed limit.  Jimenez also testified that he saw Bukoski's
vehicle collide with two barriers and some equipment, then drive
partially onto a sidewalk and hit a fence.  The second barrier
struck a construction worker, Lawrence Asai.  Just before Bukoski
collided with the first barrier, Bukoski's head was tilted down
at a 45-degree angle. 
Based on the testimony that Bukoski exceeded the speed
limit and/or drove with his head down in the construction zone,
where there were warning devices visible to oncoming traffic,
there was sufficient circumstantial evidence that Bukoski
consciously disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
he was operating his vehicle "without due care or in a manner"
that would "cause a collision with, . . . or damage to" persons
or property.  See State v. Nelson, 69 Haw. 461, 469, 748 P.2d
365, 370 (1987) (court, as trier of fact, "may draw all
reasonable and legitimate inferences and deductions from the
evidence adduced" (quoting Lono v. State , 63 Haw. 470, 473, 629
P.2d 630, 633 (1981))); Mitchell, 94 Hawai# i at 393, 15 P.3d at
319 ("The appellate court will neither reconcile conflicting
evidence nor interfere with the decision of the trier of fact
based on the witnesses' credibility or the weight of the
evidence." (citing Gabrillo, 10 Haw. App.  at 457, 877 P.2d at
895)); State v. Rapozo , 123 Hawai #i 329, 330 n.4, 235 P.3d 325,
334 n.4 (2010) (unchallenged FOFs are binding on the appellate
court); Haw. Rev. Stat. §§ 291-12 and 702-206; see also State v.
Eastman, 81 Hawai# i 131, 141, 913 P.2d 57, 67 (1996) (state of
mind may be proven through circumstantial evidence) (citing State
v. Batson , 73 Haw. 236, 254, 831 P.2d 924, 934 (1992)). 
7NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
C. Motion for Judgment of Acquittal
Bukoski argues that the District Court erroneously
denied his motion for judgment of acquittal, based on HRS section
701-109(1)(e), because Counts 2 and 3 occurred through a
continuous course of conduct and, thus, merged.  The State
responds that it "does not oppose the merger of counts 2 and 3."
Despite the State's concession, "appellate courts have
an independent duty 'first to ascertain that the confession of
error is supported by the record and well-founded in law and
second to determine that such error is properly preserved and
prejudicial.'"  State v. Veikoso , 102 Hawai# i 219, 221–22, 74
P.3d 575, 577–78 (2003) (quoting State v. Hoang, 93 Hawai# i 333,
336, 3 P.3d 499, 502 (2000)).  In other words, the State's
concession "is not binding upon an appellate court[.]"  Hoang, 93
Hawai#i at 336, 3 P.3d at 502 (internal quotation marks omitted)
(quoting Territory v. Kogami , 37 Haw. 174, 175 (Haw. Terr.
1945)). 
We agree that the District Court erred in convicting
Bukoski on more than one count of ITD where the evidence shows
the offenses occurred through a continuing course of conduct. 
State v. Decoite , 132 Hawai #i 436, 438-39, 323 P.3d 80, 82-83
(2014) (noting the Supreme Court's definition of a continuous
offense); see also Haw. Rev. Stat. §§ 291-12 and 701-109(1)(e)
(2014); State v. Arceo, 84 Hawai# i 1, 21, 928 P.2d 843, 863
(1996) (holding that the prohibition against multiple convictions
for uninterrupted, continuing course conduct does not apply where
these actions constitute separate offenses under the law).  The
evidence does not show that Bukoski possessed a distinct and
separate intent with regard to each collision.  For instance,
there is no evidence that Bukoski continued to exceed the speed
limit or angle his head down after striking the first barrier. 
See, e.g., State v. Rapoza , 95 Hawai #i 321, 329, 22 P.3d 968, 976
(2001) (affirming defendant's conviction encompassing one offense
where he pointed a firearm in the direction of three complaining
witnesses and, over the course of a few seconds, discharged the
weapon five to seven times).  Therefore, these counts should be
merged. 
8NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
D. Prosecutorial Misconduct
In its closing argument, the State did not
impermissibly shift the burden of proof to Bukoski, as Bukoski
alleges.5  Rather, the State maintained that Bukoski failed to
rebut the evidence against him, which was not improper, see State
v. Napulou , 85 Hawai #i 49, 59, 936 P.2d 1297, 1307 (App. 1997) (A
"prosecutor may make comments on . . . the failure of the defense
to introduce material evidence[.]"), and did not amount to
prosecutorial misconduct or denial of Bukoski's right to a fair
trial.  See State v. Tasani, No. CAAP-11-0000131, 2012 WL
1071518, *1 (Haw. App. March 30, 2012) (In order to determine
whether the alleged misconduct amounts to reversible error, "we
consider 'the nature of the alleged misconduct, the promptness or
lack of a curative instruction, and the strength or weakness of
the evidence against defendant.'" (quoting State v. Iuli , 101
Hawai#i 196, 208, 65 P.3d 143, 155 (2003))); State v. McGriff , 76
Hawai#i 148, 158, 871 P.2d 782, 792 (1994) ("Prosecutorial
misconduct warrants a new trial or the setting aside of a guilty
verdict only where the actions of the prosecutor have caused
prejudice to the defendant's right to a fair trial." (citing
State v. Pemberton, 71 Haw. 466, 476, 796 P.2d 80, 85 (1990)));
State v. Agrabante, 73 Haw. 179, 198, 830 P.2d 492, 502 (1992)
(setting out the standard for deciding whether alleged
prosecutorial misconduct reached the level of reversible error);
State v. Hauge , 103 Hawai #i 38, 56-57, 79 P.3d 131, 149-50 (2003)
(in closing argument, a prosecutor is permitted to draw
reasonable inferences from the evidence and has wide latitude in
discussing the evidence (quoting State v. Clark, 83 Hawai# i 289,
304-05, 926 P.2d 194, 209-10 (1996))). 
Bukoski argues that the State mis-characterized certain
evidence in its closing argument.  Assuming for the sake of
5/Bukoski contests the following argument:
There's been no testimony regarding something running in
front of him.  There's been no testimony about the vehicle
having some sort of mechanical problem.  There's been no
testimony about any other kind of possibility out there that
may make a car jerk off the road and run . . . over somebody.
9NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
argument that the first contested statement is inaccurate,6 the
error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because Bukoski
argues that only one witness testified that his speed exceeded 15
miles per hour in the construction zone.  That testimony alone,
however, was sufficient to support the conviction.  See, supra,
Part III.B.
We agree that the second contested statement7 contains
an inaccuracy because at trial, Bukoski adduced Officer Hsu's
testimony that he did not note in his police report that Bukoski
drove too fast or exceeded the speed limit.  However, the
misstatement was harmless because there was other evidence to
support the District Court's finding that Bukoski exceeded the
speed limit.  Finally, any error with regard to the third alleged
mis-characterization8 was also harmless beyond a reasonable doubt
because Bukoski's collision with a barrier was sufficient to
support the conviction.
IV. CONCLUSION
For the reasons explained above, Counts 2 and 3 of
Inattention to Driving in the Second Amended Complaint are deemed
to have merged under HRS section 701-109(1)(e).  Therefore, both
6/As part of his closing argument, the prosecutor stated:
A law-abiding citizen doesn't drive through a
construction zone, in [Jimenez's] testimony, at the higher
rate of speed than 15 miles per hour, which we've established
through two witnesses now, and it's during school hours, which
is established by two witnesses, so more reason to be careful,
as well as near a construction zone.
(Contested portions emphasized.)  Bukoski argues that only one witness
testified that his speed exceeded 15 miles per hour.
7/The prosecutor also stated:
[T]he testimony was that [Bukoski] was going above the speed
limit . . . .   There's no defense that none of that occurred.
8/The third alleged mis-characterization is as follows:
Quite simply, [Jimenez] testified that he drove his
vehicle with his head facing down, and he drove through three
barriers, he drove through some equipment, he hit somebody
along the way, and he did all of those things not in a way
that a law-abiding citizen would do it.
