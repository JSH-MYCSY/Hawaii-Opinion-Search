APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 14-1-1343)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Chan, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Galilee Maraea Laniakea Chee ( Chee)
submitted a notice of appeal on March 23, 2017, which was filed
on March 28, 2017, and which does not designate the specific
judgment or order appealed from.
It appears, however, from the record on appeal, that on
December 14, 2015, the Circuit Court of the First CircuitNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(Circuit Court)1 entered an order granting Plaintiff-Appellee The
Bank of New York Mellon fka the Bank of New York's, as Trustee
for the Certificate Holders of CWALT, Inc., Alternative Loan
Trust 2007-15CB, Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2007-
15CB (Bank of New York ), motion for summary judgment and
interlocutory decree of foreclosure (Foreclosure Decree ), that a
judgment in favor of Bank of New York and against Chee was
entered on the Foreclosure Decree on December 14, 2015 ( Original
Judgment), and that an amended judgment on the Foreclosure Decree
was entered on November 14, 2016 (Amended Judgment on Foreclosure
Decree).  Chee did not timely file a notice of appeal from either
the Original Judgment or the Amended Judgment on Foreclosure
Decree.
On February 22, 2017, the Circuit Court entered an
order granting Bank of New York's motion to confirm the sale of
the foreclosed property ( Order Confirming Sale ), as well as a
Writ of Possession, and a Hawai #i Rules of Civil Procedure Rule
54(b) certified judgment on the Order Confirming Sale ( Judgment
on Order Confirming Sale ).  Thereafter, on March 23, 2017, Chee
submitted her notice of appeal, which was timely with respect to
the Judgment on Order Confirming Sale.
Pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS ) ยง 667-
51(a)(2)2, this court's appellate jurisdiction over Chee's appeal

is limited to the Judgment on Order Confirming Sale and those
orders that were part of the series of orders that collectively
led directly to the Judgment on Order Confirming Sale.  See,
e.g., Cook v. Surety Life Ins. Co., 79 Hawai# i 403, 409, 903 P.2d
708, 714 (App. 1995); Riethbrock v. Lange , 128 Hawai #i 1, 17, 282
P.3d 543, 559 (2012); see also Mortg. Elec. Registration Sys.,
Inc. v. Wise, 130 Hawai #i 11, 17, 304 P.3d 1192, 1198 (2013)
("Because the time for appealing the judgment of foreclosure
passed without an appeal being taken, that judgment became final
and Respondent's right to foreclose was finally decided in its
favor.").
Chee's appellate briefs do not identify any specific
points of error and Chee does not appear to make any argument on
appeal regarding the confirmation of the foreclosure sale. 
Chee's discernable contention appears to be that Bank of New York
"failed to produce the Original Deed and Mortgage . . . with
original signatures," which does not appear to challenge the
confirmation of the foreclosure sale.  Nor does Chee cite to any
authority indicating that Bank of New York was required to

also be taken, the following orders entered in a foreclosure
case shall be final and appealable:
(1) A judgment entered on a decree of foreclosure .
. .
(2) A judgment entered on an order confirming the
sale of the foreclosed property, if the circuit
court expressly finds that no just reason for
delay exists, and certifies the judgment as
final pursuant to rule 54(b) of the Hawaii rules
of civil procedure; and
(3) A deficiency judgment . . . .
(b) An appeal shall be taken in the manner and within
the time provided by the rules of court.
Pursuant to Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 4(a)(1), appeals
in civil cases "shall be filed within 30 days after entry of the judgment or
appealable order."

produce the original, executed deed and mortgage to obtain
confirmation of the foreclosure sale, and we find none. 
Although Chee's position regarding jurisdiction is
unclear, insofar as Chee argues that she is not subject to the
government and courts of the State of Hawai# i, we reject this
contention.  See State v. Kaulia, 128 Hawai# i 479, 487, 291 P.3d
377, 385 (2013) (reaffirming, "'whatever may be said regarding
the lawfulness' of its origins, 'the State of Hawai #i is now, a
lawful government.'" (internal brackets and ellipses omitted)
(quoting State v. Fergerstrom, 106 Hawai #i 43, 55, 101 P.3d 652,
664 (App. 2004), aff'd, 106 Hawai# i 41, 101 P.3d 225 (2004))).  
Chee's remaining arguments are indiscernible or appear
to be directed at matters over which we have no appellate
jurisdiction. 
For these reasons, we affirm the Circuit Court's
February 22, 2017 Judgment on Order Confirming Sale.
