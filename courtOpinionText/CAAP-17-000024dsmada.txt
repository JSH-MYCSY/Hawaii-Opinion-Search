APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 16-1-0734)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
jurisdiction over this appeal by Frank Michael Fernandez, aka
 
Frank M. Fernandez and Frank Fernandez (Frank), and Janis
 
Fernandez (Janis) (collectively, Appellants) because the Circuit
 
Court of the First Circuit1
 (circuit court) has not reduced its
 
dispositive rulings on substantive claims to a separate, final
 judgment, as Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 
1
 The Honorable Rhonda A. Nishimura presided.

§ 641-1(a) (2016) and Rule 58 of the Hawai 'i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRCP) require for an appeal from a civil, circuit-
court case, under the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming 
& Wright, 76 Hawai 'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
When a circuit court adjudicates an appeal from an 
administrative agency order, "[r]eview of any final judgment of 
the circuit court or, if applicable, the environmental court, 
under this chapter shall be governed by chapter 602." HRS 
§ 91-15 (Supp. 2016). This court has jurisdiction "[t]o hear and 
determine appeals from any court or agency when appeals are 
allowed by law[.]" HRS § 602-57(1) (2016). Under Hawai 'i law, 
"[a]ppeals shall be allowed in civil matters from all final judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit . . . courts[.]" HRS 
§ 641-1(a) (2016). Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in 
the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS 
§ 641-1(c) (2016). 
HRCP Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be 
set forth on a separate document." Based on this requirement, 
the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has held that "[a]n appeal may be 
taken from circuit court orders resolving claims against parties only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the 
judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate 
parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 
119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (emphasis added). "Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves 
all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a 
separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai
'i 245, 
254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008). HRCP Rule 72(k)2
 similarly
requires that, upon a circuit court's adjudication of an
 
administrative appeal, "the court having jurisdiction shall enter

 HRCP Rule 81(e) requires that the Hawai 'i Rules of Civil 
Procedure "shall apply to any proceedings in a circuit court
pursuant to appeal to the circuit court from a governmentalofficial or body (other than a court), except as otherwiseprovided in Rule 72."

judgment." 
Therefore, the separate judgment document rule under 
the holding in Jenkins applies to a secondary appeal from a 
circuit court order that adjudicates an administrative appeal. 
See, e.g., Raquinio v. Nakanelua, 77 Hawai 'i 499, 500, 889 P.2d 
76, 77 (App. 1995) ("We conclude . . . that the requirements for appealability set forth in Jenkins apply to appeals from circuit 
court orders deciding appeals from orders entered by the Director 
of Labor and Industrial Relations."). 
When interpreting the requirements for a judgment under 
the separate document rule, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i noted 
that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality[.] 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (emphasis in 
original). "[A]n appeal from any judgment will be dismissed as 
premature if the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve 
all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary 
for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i 
at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (emphasis in original). 
The December 13, 2016 Final Judgment is not final and
 
appealable because it does not enter a judgment as to
 Respondent/Appellant/Appellee Exodus Bail Bonds, LLC. 
"If the judgment resolves fewer than all claims against 
all parties or reserves any claim for later action by the court, 
an appeal may be taken only if the judgment contains the language 
necessary for certification, under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)" including 
"the necessary finding of no just reason for delay." Jenkins, 76 
Hawai
'i at 119-20, 869 P.2d 1338-39. However, the Final 
Judgment is not HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified.

While exceptions to the final judgment requirement
 
exist under Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848) (the Forgay
 
doctrine), the collateral-order doctrine, and HRS § 641–1(b),
 
none of these exceptions applies. See Ciesla v. Reddish, 
78 Hawai‘i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) ; Abrams v. Cades,
 Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai‘i 319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634
 
(1998); HRS § 641–1(b). 
Absent an appealable, final judgment or order, this
 
court lacks jurisdiction over the appeal.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appeal No. 
CAAP-17-0000024 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
