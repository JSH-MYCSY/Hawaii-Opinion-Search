NO. CAAP-17-0000308
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
PHILIP BIKLE, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 3DTC-16-005744)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Fujise and Chan, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
appellate jurisdiction over Defendant-Appellant Philip Bikle's
 
(Appellant's) pro se appeal from the Honorable Michael J.
 
Udovik's March 2, 2017 order in district court Criminal 
No. 3DTA-16-005744 denying Appellant's motion to dismiss the case
 for lack of jurisdiction and ordering Appellant to appear for
 trial because the district court has not yet entered a final
 decision or judgment.
 
"The right to an appeal is strictly statutory." State
 
v. Ontiveros, 82 Hawai
'i 446, 449, 923 P.2d 388, 391 (1996) 
(citation omitted). This court has jurisdiction "[t]o hear and determine appeals from any court or agency when appeals are allowed by law[.]" Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 602-57(1) (2016). HRS ยง 641-12 (2016) provides that "[a]ppeals upon the record shall be allowed from all final decisions and final NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
judgments of district courts in all criminal matters." Appellant
 
is not appealing from a final decision or judgment of the
 district court because the district court has not yet held a
 trial and the charges have not been resolved. The March 2, 2017
 order is a non-final, interlocutory order. Absent an appealable
 final decision or judgment, we lack appellate jurisdiction over
 Appellant's appeal.
 
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Case 
No. CAAP-17-0000308 is dismissed.
