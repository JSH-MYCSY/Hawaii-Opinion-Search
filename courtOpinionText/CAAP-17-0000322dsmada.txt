NO. CAAP-17-0000322
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Petitioner-Appellee, v.
JOZUA HFVAK, aka JON MAJOR, Respondent-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(S.P. NO. 16-1-0325)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPELLATE COURT CASE NUMBER
 
CAAP-17-0000322 PURSUANT TO THE MOOTNESS DOCTRINE
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Fujise and Chan, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record on appeal for appellate court
 
case number CAAP-17-0000322, it appears that Respondent-Appellant
 
Jozua Hfvak aka Jon Major's (Appellant Hfvak) appeal from the
 Honorable Colette Y. Garibaldi's December 14, 2016 minute order
 and December 14, 2016 order pertaining to bail is moot, because
 our review of the record reveals that on March 30, 2017, the
 Honorable William M. Domingo entered an order granting
 Petitioner-Appellee State of Hawaii's (Appellee State) ex parte
 motion to withdraw Appellee State's September 12, 2016 complaint
 to extradite Appellant Hfvak to the State of Washington and
 withdraw Governor David Y. Ige's December 12, 2016 warrant for
 the arrest of Appellant Hfvak, which finally determined, and,
 thus, ended all extradition proceedings in S.P. No. 16-1-0325 in
 a manner that is favorable to Appellant Hfvak.

A case is moot if it has lost its character as a present,
live controversy of the kind that must exist if courts are
to avoid advisory opinions on abstract propositions of law.
The rule is one of the prudential rules of judicial self-
governance founded in concern about the proper - and
properly limited - role of the courts in a democratic
society. We have said the suit must remain alive throughout
the course of litigation to the moment of final appellate
disposition to escape the mootness bar. . . . Simply put, a
case is moot if the reviewing court can no longer grant
effective relief.
 
Kaho'ohanohano v. State , 114 Hawai 'i 302, 332, 162 P.3d 696, 726 
(2007) (citations, internal quotation marks, and brackets
 
omitted; emphasis added). In light of the fact that the
 March 30, 2017 order effectively dismisses all proceedings in
 S.P. No. 16-1-0325, it appears that we can no longer grant
 effective relief to Appellant Hfvak, and his appeal is moot. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number
 
CAAP-17-0000322 is dismissed as moot.
