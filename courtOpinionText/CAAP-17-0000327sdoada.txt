Amended Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law (Amended FOFs & 
COLs). 
Husband appears to raise a single point of error on 
appeal, contending that the Family Court exceeded the scope of 
the remand in Kodama I.3 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve Husband's point of error as follows: 
In Kodama I, this court vacated the provisions of the 
June 1, 2011 Divorce Decree (2011 Divorce Decree) that related 
to, or were affected by our decision regarding, the division of 
certain real property located on Maui (Maui Property), the award 
of Life Insurance Policy 80004 (Policy 80004), and the valuation of the investment accounts owned by Husband at the date of 
marriage (Pre-Marital Investments).  We remanded the case to the 
Family Court for further proceedings consistent with Kodama I, 
specifically ruling that the Family Court would be entitled to make all necessary adjustments in its property division to address the errors we determined were made in the 2011 Divorce Decree. The Divorce Decree was affirmed in all other respects. 
On remand, the Family Court addressed the errors 
related to the Maui Property, Policy 80004, and the valuation of the Pre-Marital Investments, as directed by the ICA. Based on 
3 Notwithstanding representation by experienced appellate counsel,
to the extent Husband may be attempting to raise multiple points of error, the
Opening Brief fails to comply with Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure ( HRAP )
Rule 28(b)(4), including, inter alia , the requirement of a "concise statement
of the points of error set forth in separately numbered paragraphs[.]"

the Family Court's adjustments, absent a deviation from 
partnership principles, it appears that an equalization payment in the principal amount of $283,501.07 would have been payable to Husband from Plaintiff-Appellee Cindy Churan Kodama (Wife). 
However, based on a determination that there are valid and 
relevant considerations (VARCs) justifying a deviation from 
partnership principles, the Family Court ordered a 
disproportionate award to Wife of $200,000, and the Family Court ordered Wife to pay Husband $83,501.07. The Family Court denied Husband's request for interest on the $83,501.07 from the date of the 2011 Divorce Decree and instead ordered that interest would run only from the date of the Amended Decree. 
Pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 580-47 
(Supp. 2017),  "the family court has wide discretion to divide 
marital partnership property according to what is 'just and equitable' based on the facts and circumstances of each case." 4
4 HRS § 580-47 states, in relevant part: 
§ 580-47 Support orders; division of property.  (a)
Upon granting a divorce, or thereafter if, in addition to
the powers granted in subsections (c) and (d), jurisdictionof those matters is reserved under the decree by agreementof both parties or by order of court after finding that goodcause exists, the court may make any further orders as shallappear just and equitable . . . (3) finally dividing anddistributing the estate of the parties, real, personal, ormixed, whether community, joint, or separate; and (4)
allocating, as between the parties, the responsibility for
the payment of the debts of the parties whether community,joint, or separate, and the attorney's fees, costs, andexpenses incurred by each party by reason of the divorce. Inmaking these further orders, the court shall take intoconsideration: the respective merits of the parties, therelative abilities of the parties, the condition in whicheach party will be left by the divorce, the burdens imposedupon either party for the benefit of the children of theparties, the concealment of or failure to disclose income oran asset, or violation of a restraining order issued undersection 580-10(a) or (b), if any, by either party, and allother circumstances of the case.

Gordon v. Gordon, 135 Hawai# i 340, 348-49, 350 P.3d 1008, 1016-17 
(2015) (citation omitted). Hawai
#i has developed a framework for 
the division of marital property based on marital partnership 
principles to guide family courts in their division of marital property. Id. at 349, 350 P.3d at 1017. There are four steps that must be followed by a family court to establish the value of marital property and then distribute it. First, the court must find all facts necessary to properly categorize the property into one of five categories and assign the property the relevant net market values.  Id. at 349-50, 350 P.3d at 1017-18. Second, the 
family court must identify any equitable considerations justifying deviation from an equal distribution between the parties. Id. at 350, 350 P.3d at 1018. Third, the court must decide whether there will be a deviation. Id. Finally, the family court must decide the extent of any deviation. Id.

To determine whether equitable considerations justify a 
deviation from the partnership model, the family court must consider the following: "the respective merits of the parties, 
5 In Gordon, the Hawai #i Supreme Court explained that the categories
consist of: 
Category 1 includes the net market value of property
separately owned by a spouse on the date of marriage;Category 2 includes the increase in the net marketvalue of Category 1 property during the marriage;Category 3 includes the net market value of propertyseparately acquired by gift or inheritance during themarriage;Category 4 includes the increase in the net marketvalue of Category 3 property during the marriage;
and 
Category 5 includes the net market value of theremaining marital estate at the conclusion of theevidentiary part of the trial.

the relative abilities of the parties, the condition in which 
each party will be left by the divorce, the burdens imposed upon either party for the benefit of the children of the parties, and all other circumstances of the case." Id. at 352–53, 350 P.3d at 1020–21 (citing HRS § 580–47(a)); see also Hamilton v. Hamilton, 138 Hawai# i 185, 206, 378 P.3d 901, 922 (2016) (same). 
The errors identified in Kodama I all pertained to the 
first step of the above framework, i.e.,
 the findings of fact 
necessary to properly categorize the property into one of five categories and assign the property the relevant net market values. See Gordon, 135 Hawai# i at 349-50, 350 P.3d at 1017-18. 
We reject Husband's argument that the Family Court abused its discretion in considering whether deviation was appropriate after making the necessary findings to correct the errors identified in Kodama I, as this court specifically ordered that "[o]n remand, the Family Court will be entitled to make all necessary adjustments in its property division to address the errors we have determined were made by the Family Court in this appeal." Kodama I, 2014 WL 7451246, at *15 (emphasis added). 
We also reject Husband's argument that the principles 
of res judicata
 or the law of the case doctrine precluded the 
Family Court from finding that a deviation was necessary, after the court corrected its step 1 errors, because the Family Court had not previously found that a deviation was necessary. Res 
judicata is inapplicable here as this matter involves further proceedings in the same case, not a prior adjudication. See, e.g., Smallwood v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 118 Hawai# i 139, 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
146-50 185 P.3d 887, 894-98 (App. 2008) (discussing doctrine of 
res judicata). The law of the case doctrine provides that "a determination of a question of law made by an appellate court in the course of an action becomes the law of the case and may not be disputed by a reopening of the question at a later stage of the litigation." Hussey v. Say, 139 Hawai# i 181, 185, 384 P.3d 
1282, 1286 (2016) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). This doctrine is also inapplicable here as the ICA in Kodama I made no determination concerning whether deviation from marital partnership principles was warranted, but merely noted that the Family Court, in the 2011 Decree, had not justified its award of equity from the Maui Property on that basis. 
Husband next argues that the Family Court erred because 
it received no new evidence on remand prior to determining that VARCs justified a deviation in favor of Wife. 
However, Husband 
did not argue in the proceedings on remand that further evidence was necessary and, therefore, this argument is waived. See, e.g., Asato v. Procurement Policy Bd., 132 Hawai# i 333, 354 n.22, 
322 P.3d 228, 249 n.22 (2014) (citation omitted) ("[a]s a general rule, if a party does not raise an argument at trial, that argument will be deemed to have been waived on appeal".") 
Based on evidence presented before the entry of the 
2011 Divorce Decree, the Family Court reiterated its findings that: (1) Wife had limited employment skills and opportunities due to her service as a stay-at-home mother during the marriage; (2) Wife was not able to use her prior college education and pursue employment opportunities during the marriage; (3) Wife 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
will not be as financially secure as Husband as a result; (4) 
Husband was able to work and advance his career during the marriage; (5) Husband has been able to sustain a successful and profitable business and will be able to continue that business after the marriage; and (6) Husband will likely be financially secure after the marriage. Thus, contrary to Husband's argument on this appeal, we conclude that the Family Court made appropriate findings and justifications on remand to support deviation from partnership principles. 
We conclude that Husband's further arguments concerning 
the Family Court's Amended FOFs & COLs are without merit or, in essence, address clerical errors that are harmless.

Finally, we reject Husband's argument that he is 
entitled to interest on the $83,501.07 equalization payment calculated from the date of the original judgment in August 2011. We note that, in Gurrobat v. HTH Corp., 135 Hawai# i 128, 141, 346 
P.3d 197, 210 (2015), the supreme court held, 
inter alia, that 
"[w]hile remand will still result in a judgment awarding money damages to Gurrobat, the judgment will likely not be in the amount initially awarded. Under the circumstances, therefore, an award of post judgment interest under HRS § 478–3 is not 
6 For example, it appears that the Family Court's failure to delete
the reference in the Amended FOFs & COLs to certain deleted FOFs was an 
oversight by the Family Court. Nevertheless, the error is harmless becauseeven without it, the remaining FOFs provide substantial evidence to supportthe Family Court's finding that deviation from marital partnership principleswas necessary. See, e.g., Dupree v. Hiraga, 121 Hawai #i 297, 320 n.28, 219
P.3d 1084, 1107 n.28 (2009) ("FOF No. 13 . . . is therefore clearly erroneous.However, we find the error was harmless . . . ."); Kawamoto v. NHC, Inc., No.29295, 2009 WL 3350309 at *5 (Haw. App. Oct. 19, 2009) (sdo) (stating that achallenged LIRAB finding played no "meaningful role" in LIRAB's determination
regarding claimant's injury and thus any potential error was harmless).

appropriate." Similarly, in Kodoma I, we remanded the case to 
the Family Court to conduct further proceedings and Husband's award could only be ascertained after the completion of these proceedings; indeed, there was no such award upon the entry of the "judgment" in Kodama I. Thus, we conclude that the Family Court did not err in refusing to award Husband post-judgment interest from the earlier date. 
For these reasons, the Family Court's April 3, 2017 
Amended Decree is affirmed.
