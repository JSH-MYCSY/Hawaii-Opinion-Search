ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
jurisdiction over the consolidated appeal1 that Petitioner-
Appellant Hardy K. Ah Puck, Jr. (Appellant ) has asserted from the
Circuit Court of the Second Circuit's "Findings of Fact,
Conclusions of Law, and Judgment Denying Petition to Vacate, Set
Aside, or Correct a Judgment or to Release Petitioner from
Custody," issued in each of SPP Nos. 16-1-0016(2), -0017(2), 
and -0018(2), because the appeal is untimely under Rule 4(b) of
the Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP).
In this case, HRAP Rule 4(b) provides the controlling
time period for filing a notice of appeal.  "[P]ursuant to HRAP
1  This court consolidated Appeal Nos. CAAP-17-0000329, 
-0000330, and -0000331, under CAAP-17-0000329, on October 10,
2017. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Rule 4(b)(1), an appeal from an order denying post-conviction
relief must either be filed within thirty days after the entry of
the order denying the HRPP Rule 40 petition or, in the
alternative, after the announcement but before the entry of the
order."  Grattafiori v. State , 79 Hawai #i 10, 13, 897 P.2d 937,
940 (1995).   
Here, the notices of appeal filed in Appeal Nos. CAAP-
17-0000329, -0000330, and -0000331 were due within thirty days
after entry of the January 14, 2017 FOF/COL/Order Denying
Petition in each of SPP Nos. 16-1-0016(2), -0017(2), and -
0018(2), according to HRAP Rule 4(b)(1).  Appellant filed the
notices of appeal on April 6, 2017, which was more than thirty
days after January 14, 2017.  There is no evidence before this
court that Appellant was granted an extension of time to file any
of the notices of appeal. 
"In criminal cases, [the Supreme Court of Hawai# i]
ha[s] made exceptions to the requirement that notices of appeal
be timely filed."  State v. Irvine , 88 Hawai #i 404, 407, 967 P.2d
236, 239 (1998).  Specifically, the Supreme Court of Hawai #i has
permitted belated appeals under two sets of circumstances:
(a) [when] defense counsel has inexcusably or ineffectively
failed to pursue a defendant's appeal from a criminal
conviction in the first instance, or (2) [when] the lower
court's decision was unannounced and no notice of the entry
of judgment was ever provided.
Grattafiori v. State , 79 Hawai #i at 13-14, 897 P.2d at 940-41
(citations omitted).  These two exceptions do not apply here
because (1) the case does not involve an appeal from Appellant's
criminal convictions in the first instance and (2) the circuit
court clearly announced its decisions by filing each
FOF/COL/Order Denying Petition.  The appeal is not timely.  
"As a general rule, compliance with the requirement of
the timely filing of a notice of appeal is jurisdictional, . . .
and we must dismiss an appeal on our own motion if we lack
jurisdiction."  Grattafiori v. State , 79 Hawai #i at 13, 897 P.2d
at 940 (citations, internal quotation marks, and brackets
omitted); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or justice is
authorized to change the jurisdictional requirements contained in
-2-NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Rule 4 of these rules."); HRAP Rule 26(e) ("The reviewing court
for good cause shown may relieve a party from a default
occasioned by any failure to comply with these rules, except the
failure to give timely notice of appeal.").  
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
case number CAAP-17-0000329 is dismissed for lack of appellate
jurisdiction.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, February 16, 2018.
