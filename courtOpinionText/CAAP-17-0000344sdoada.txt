IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
DEVON FINNEY, Petitioner-Appellant,
v. 
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Respondent-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
(S.P. NO. 16-1-0016)
(FC-CR NO. 07-1-0161) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.) 
Petitioner-Appellant Devon Finney (Finney) was 
convicted of Abuse of Family or Household Member in violation of 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 709-906 (Supp. 2006) by way of a 
"Judgment Guilty Conviction and Probation Sentence" (Judgment) 
entered against him on January 28, 2008, in FC-CR No. 07-1-0161. 
Finney had pleaded guilty to the charge. Finney did not appeal from the Judgment. 
On August 15, 2016, Finney filed a "Petition for Writ 
of Error Coram Nobis" and on November 21, 2016, Finney filed "Defendant's Submission of Conforming Rule 40 Petition to Post Conviction Relief Filed on August 15, 2016" (collectively,Petition). 
On April 6, 2017, the Circuit Court of the Fifth 
Circuit (circuit court)
1 filed "Findings of Fact; Conclusions of 
1 The Honorable Kathleen N.A. Watanabe presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 Law; Order Denying [Finney's] Rule 40, HRPP [Hawai# i Rules of 
Penal Procedure] Petition Filed November 21, 2016 & Petition for 
Writ of Error Coram Nobis, Filed August 15, 2016" (Order Denying
Rule 40 Petition). 
The circuit court dismissed Finney's Petition 
without a hearing on the grounds that he had waived his claims by 
failing to appeal from the Judgment, and that even on the merits Finney's claims were patently frivolous and lacked a trace of support in the record or other evidence submitted by the parties. Finney appeals from the Order Denying Rule 40 Petition. 
On appeal, Finney asserts error on two grounds. First, 
that the circuit court should have held a hearing on his claim that he: 
wanted to withdraw his guilty plea at the sentencing hearing
but counsel advised him that he could not do so and Finneyrelied upon that advice in allowing himself to be sentenced(and in failing to appeal his conviction). This allegationwas incorporated in the Rule 40 petition. This advice was clearly wrong and, if proven, would entitle Finney towithdraw his plea and have a trial, based on ineffectiveassistance of counsel. 
. . . . Clearly this advice was an error reflecting counsel's lack
of skill. In addition, as the result of this error, Finneygave up his right to trial. In other words, he gave up allof his defenses, including reasonable doubt. This error, ifproven, would have entitled Finney to withdraw his guiltyplea and have a trial on the merits. 
(Internal citations omitted). Second, Finney argues the circuit 
court "erred when it denied [his] Petition without a hearing as [he] had proffered sufficient evidence and supporting authorities establishing a colorable claim for relief, in that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate his case by failing to interview the Complainant [(CW)], and as a result 
Finney's guilty plea was not knowingly and voluntarily entered."

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as 
2 Finney did not file a direct appeal from the Judgment. However, his
instant challenge pertains to ineffective assistance of his counsel, including
as to an attorney who remained his counsel of record at the time an appealwould have been taken. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Finney's 
points of error as follows. 
HRPP Rule 40(f) provides, in relevant part, that "[i]f 
a petition alleges facts that if proven would entitle the petitioner to relief, the court shall grant a hearing which may extend only to the issues raised in the petition or answer." 
As a general rule, a hearing should be held on a Rule 40
petition for post-conviction relief where the petitionstates a colorable claim. To establish a colorable claim,the allegations of the petition must show that if taken astrue the facts alleged would change the [outcome of thecase], however, a petitioner's conclusions need not be
regarded as true. 
 
Najera v. State, 143 Hawai# i 83, 88, 422 P.3d 661, 666 (App. 
2018) (brackets in original) (quoting Dan v. State, 76 Hawai# i
  
423, 427, 879 P.2d 528, 532 (1994) ((quoting State v. Allen, 7 
Haw. App. 89, 92, 744 P.2d 789, 792 (1987))). Further, 
Where examination of the record of the trial court 
proceedings indicates that the petitioner's allegations showno colorable claim, it is not error to deny the petitionwithout a hearing. The question on appeal of a denial of aRule 40 petition without a hearing is whether the trialrecord indicates that Petitioner's application for reliefmade such a showing of a colorable claim as to require ahearing before the lower court. 
Dan, 76 Hawai# i at 427, 879 P.2d at 532 (quoting Allen, 7 Haw. 
App. at 92-93, 744 P.2d at 792-93)).
(1)  Finney asserts that his sentencing counsel, Deputy 
Public Defender John Calma (Calma), erroneously told him that he 
could not withdraw his guilty plea before sentencing. The 
Supreme Court of Hawai# i recently held in Maddox v. State, 141 
Hawai# i
 196, 407 P.3d 152 (2017) that: 
This court set forth the standard by which we evaluate
claims of ineffective assistance of counsel under the Hawai #i Constitution in State v. Antone, 62 Haw. 346,
348–49, 615 P.2d 101, 104 (1980). "General claims of ineffectiveness are insufficient" to establish that the assistance a defendant received was constitutionallyineffective. Dan, 76 Hawai #i at 427, 879 P.2d at 532
(quoting Briones v. State, 74 Haw. 442, 462–63, 848 P.2d966, 976 (1993)). Rather, a defendant must show: (1)"specific errors or omissions of defense counsel reflectingcounsel's lack of skill, judgment[,] or diligence"; and that(2) "those errors or omissions resulted in the withdrawal orsubstantial impairment of a potentially meritoriousdefense." Antone, 62 Haw. at 348–49, 615 P.2d at 104(internal citations omitted). Thus, to be entitled to aRule 40 hearing on the basis of ineffective assistance ofcounsel, [a defendant] must first allege facts identifying aspecific error or wrongful omission made by his counsel. 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
. . . . 
When evaluating whether defense counsel's omission deprived
a defendant of a potentially meritorious defense, weconsider "the possible, rather than the probable, effect" ofthe error. Wilton v. State, 116 Hawai #i  106, 119, 170 P.3d
357, 370 (2007) (quoting Briones, 74 Haw. at 464, 848 P.2dat 977). "Accordingly, no showing of actual prejudice isrequired to prove ineffective assistance of counsel." Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). We therefore do not inquire into whether [a defendant's] appeal would succeed onthe merits, but instead we address whether trial counsel'sfailure to fulfill the steps necessary to pursue an appealpossibly impaired [a defendant's] defense. 
Id. at 202, 205, 407 P.3d at 158, 161. 
Finney specifically alleges that Calma's advice that 
Finney could not withdraw his guilty plea prior to sentencing 
demonstrates a lack of skill, judgment, or diligence on the part of Calma. HRPP Rule 32(d) provides, in relevant part:
Rule 32. Sentence and judgment. 
. . . . 
(d) Withdrawal of plea . A motion to withdraw a plea
of guilty or of nolo contendere may be made before sentence 
is imposed or imposition of sentence is suspended; provided
that, to correct manifest injustice the court, upon aparty's motion submitted no later than ten (10) days afterimposition of sentence, shall set aside the judgment ofconviction and permit the defendant to withdraw the plea.At any later time, a defendant seeking to withdraw a plea ofguilty or nolo contendere may do so only by petitionpursuant to Rule 40 of these rules and the court shall notset aside such a plea unless doing so is necessary tocorrect manifest injustice. 
(Emphasis added). Finney's claim that Calma advised him that he 
could not withdraw his guilty plea before sentencing, if true, could have substantially impaired all of Finney's potential defenses because Finney alleges based on that advice he chose not to withdraw his guilty plea. Cf.  Maddox, 141 Hawai# i at 201-06, 
407 P.3d at 157-62 (holding that, as alleged in defendant's HRPP Rule 40 petition, defense counsel provided ineffective assistance by stating that he could not represent defendant on appeal following dismissal of defendant's case, contrary to existing law and precedent establishing an ongoing obligation to represent defendant, which includes pursuing an appeal if a defendant so chooses). 
With regard to this claim, that Calma advised Finney 
he could not change his plea before sentencing, the circuit court erred in denying a hearing on Finney's Petition.

(2)  Finney's second ground for error is that the 
circuit court should have held a hearing based on his claim that 
his trial counsel, Deputy Public Defender Erick Moon (Moon), was 
ineffective for failing to investigate his case by failing to 
interview the CW, who is Finney's son. Finney claims that due to Moon's failure to interview the CW, Finney's guilty plea was not knowingly and voluntarily entered. In this regard, Finney submitted a letter by the CW dated January 26, 2017, which stated in relevant part that: 
As I was coming home I was coming in from the side and then
as I was coming in my dad was coming out but he didn't seeme and the screen door hit me and knocked me off the porch.My dad picked me up and asked if [I] was ok and brought meinside and told me he was going to go look for myskateboard. He did not purposely intend to hit me, it wason accident he did not know that I was coming from the sideof the house. 
Based on our review of the record, we conclude Finney 
has not made a showing of a colorable claim with regard to Moon's 
alleged failure to interview the CW, such as to require a hearing. Dan, 76 Hawai# i at 427, 879 P.2d at 532. In this 
regard, Finney does not challenge the following conclusions by the circuit court: 
12. The affidavit of [Finney's] minor son, A.K., . .
. does not reference a date or address of the incident. 
Even assuming that A.K. is referring to the same FamilyAbuse incident as that charged in [Case 161], and evenassuming that [Finney] unintentionally injured A.K. byopening the screen door, the record indicates that therewere multiple acts of violence [Finney] committed againstA.K., during this Family Abuse incident. Mainly, [Finney]slapped A.K. in the head and kicked him in his shins.[Finney] in this case also made incriminating statements onthe record during Sentencing. Therefore, the affidavit ofA.K. does not establish a colorable claim of [Finney's]actual innocence of Family Abuse in [Case 161]. 
13. [Finney] does not even allege that A.K. was
available as a witness when the charges in [Case 161] werepending in 2007-2008. Also, A.K. does not claim in hisaffidavit that he was not interviewed by a defense attorneyconcerning these charges. Thus, [Finney] fails tosubstantiate his claim that [Moon] erroneously failed tointerview A.K. See Greenwell v. State, 126 Hawaii 25 (App.2011), Summary Disposition Order. 
(Internal record citations omitted). These conclusions are 
consistent with the record in this case. Moreover, as asserted by the State, the record reflects there were other witnesses to 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the events resulting in the charge against Finney, which included 
several instances of Finney striking or physically abusing the CW. 
Given the record, the circuit court did not err in 
denying Finney's Petition without a hearing regarding Finney's claim that Moon failed to properly interview the CW. 
Therefore, with respect to Finney's claim that his 
sentencing counsel advised him he could not withdraw his guilty plea prior to sentencing, we vacate the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit's "Findings of Fact; Conclusions of Law; Order Denying Defendant Devon Finney's Rule 40, HRPP Petition Filed November 21, 2016 & Petition for Writ of Error Coram Nobis, Filed August 15, 2016" entered on April 6, 2017. Otherwise, we affirm. The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Summary Disposition Order.
