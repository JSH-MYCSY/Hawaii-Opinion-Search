STATE OF HAWAI #I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
LUKE BAYLOR JENKINS, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
HONOLULU DIVISION
(1DTA-16-03453)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Fujise, Presiding Judge, Ginoza and Chan, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Luke Baylor Jenkins (Jenkins)
appeals from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and
Plea/Judgment, entered on March 17, 2017 by the District Court of
the First Circuit, Honolulu Division (District Court).1
Jenkins was convicted of Operating a Vehicle Under the
Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1) (Supp. 2016).2
On appeal, Jenkins contends his right to due process
was violated because (1) he was not informed of the nature of the
1 The Honorable Linda K. Luke presided.
2 HRS § 291E-61(a) states:
§291E-61  Operating a vehicle under the influence of
an intoxicant.   (a)  A person commits the offense of
operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if
the person operates or assumes actual physical control of a
vehicle:
(1) While under the influence of alcohol in an
amount sufficient to impair the person's normal
mental faculties or ability to care for the
person and guard against casualty[.]NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
charge when the Complaint failed to state the definition of
vehicle or moped, and (2) the District Court erred by denying his
motion for judgment of acquittal.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve Jenkins's points of error as follows:
1. Jenkins's claim that his due process right3 was
violated because he was not informed of the nature of the charge
when the Complaint failed to state the definition of "vehicle" or
"moped" is without merit.  "Whether a charge sets forth all the
essential elements of a charged offense . . . is a question of
law, which we review under the de novo, or right/wrong,
standard."  State v. Mita, 124 Hawai #i 385, 389, 245 P.3d 458,
462 (2010) (citation, internal quotation marks, and brackets
omitted).  "Article I, section 14 of the Hawai #i Constitution
provides in relevant part that, '[i]n all criminal prosecutions,
the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to be informed of the
nature and cause of the accusation.'"  State v. Hitchcock , 123
Hawai#i 369, 377, 235 P.3d 365, 373 (2010).  Jenkins was charged
by Complaint with OVUII and then orally charged immediately prior
to the start of trial.  Jenkins stated that he understood the
charge.
In arguing in favor of the motion for judgment of
acquittal, Jenkins's counsel stated, "[a]nd additionally, it is
not -- the definition of "moped" or "vehicle" is not alleged in
the complaint."  However, counsel did not argue that Jenkins's
due process right was violated or that he was not informed of the
nature of the charge.  Rather, it appears that counsel's
statement was merely in support of his argument that there was no
evidence that Jenkins operated a moped.  Only on appeal does
Jenkins specifically claim that his due process right was
violated because he was not informed of the nature of the charge.
3Article I, section 5 of the Hawai #i Constitution provides in
relevant part:
Section 5.   No person shall be deprived of life, liberty or
property without due process of law[.]

Thus, Jenkins did not challenge the sufficiency of the
charge until after the State rested its case.  Because Jenkins
challenges the sufficiency of the complaint for the first time on
appeal, we apply the liberal construction rule:
Under the Motta/Wells  post-conviction liberal construction
rule, we liberally construe charges challenged for the first
time on appeal.  Under this approach, there is a presumption
of validity for charges challenged subsequent to a
conviction.  In those circumstances, this court will not
reverse a conviction based upon a defective indictment or
complaint unless the defendant can show prejudice or that
the indictment or complaint cannot within reason be
construed to charge a crime.
State v. Wheeler , 121 Hawai #i 383, 399–400, 219 P.3d 1170,
1186–87 (2009) (citations, internal quotation marks, and brackets
omitted).
Here, the charge4 tracked the language of the OVUII
statute and uses the term "vehicle" to describe what Jenkins
operated when he was alleged to have violated HRS § 291E-61.  
"Vehicle" is defined, in Chapter 291E as a "motor vehicle,"
"moped," or a "vessel."  HRS § 291E-1 (2007).  HRS § 291E-1
adopts the definitions contained in HRS § 291C-1 (2007) for both
"Motor vehicle" and "Moped" but explicitly includes mopeds as a
motor vehicle.  HRS § 291E-1.  Thus, as used in HRS Chapter 291E,
4The Complaint read as follows:
On or about September 14, 2016, in the City and County
of Honolulu, State of Hawai #i, LUKE BAYLOR JENKINS did
intentionally, knowingly or recklessly operate or assume
actual physical control of a vehicle upon a public way,
street, road, or highway while under the influence of
alcohol in an amount sufficient to impair his normal mental
faculties or ability to care for himself and guard against
casualty, and/or did operate or assume actual physical
control of a vehicle upon a public way, street, road, or
highway with .08 or more grams of alcohol per two hundred
ten liters of breath, and/or did operate or assume actual
physical control of a vehicle upon a public way, street,
road, or highway with .08 or more grams of alcohol per one
hundred milliliters or cubic centimeters of blood, thereby
committing the offense of Operating a Vehicle Under the
Influence of an Intoxicant, in violation of Section 291E-
61(a)(1) and/or (a)(3) and/or (a)(4) of the Hawai #i Revised
Statutes. LUKE BAYLOR JENKINS is subject to sentencing in
accordance with Section 291E-61(b)(1) of the Hawaii Revised
Statutes as a first offender. 
The oral charge, stated on the day of trial, is similar in that it does not
define "vehicle" or "moped."
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
"Motor vehicle" means every vehicle which is self-propelled
and every vehicle which is propelled by electric power but
not operated upon rails[.]
HRS § 291C-1.
We disagree with Jenkins's claim that "moped" needs to
be defined in the charge because "vehicle" is the relevant term. 
The statutory definition of vehicle does not create an additional
element of the offense charged and provides the person of common
understanding fair notice of what is being charged.  Mita, 124
Hawai#i at 391-92, 245 P.3d at 464-65.  Moreover, this court has
stated that,
in determining whether the accused's right to be informed of
the nature and cause of the accusation against him [or her]
has been violated, we must look to all of the information
supplied to him [or her] by the State to the point where the
court passes upon the contention that the right has been
violated.
Hitchcock, 123 Hawai #i at 379, 235 P.3d at 375 (quoting State v.
Israel, 78 Hawai #i 66, 70, 890 P.2d 303, 307 (1995)).  Here,
during the State's case at trial, Jenkins was fully informed of
the vehicle that he was accused of operating at the time of the
offense.  Jenkins's right to due process was not violated by the
language of the Complaint.
2.  There was substantial evidence supporting Jenkins's
conviction for OVUII.  Jenkins claims the District Court erred by
denying his motion for judgment of acquittal based on his
argument the State failed to prove that he was operating a
vehicle, as defined by HRS § 291E-1.  When the evidence is viewed
in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a reasonable mind
might fairly conclude, State v. Hicks, 113 Hawai# i 60, 69, 148
P.3d 493, 502 (2006) (quoting State v. Maldonado , 108 Hawai# i
436, 442, 121 P.3d 901, 907 (2005)), that Jenkins was guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt because he operated a vehicle within
the meaning of HRS § 291E-1. 
Rosalyn Ardoin (Ardoin) testified that on September 14,
2016, she saw Jenkins driving a moped that collided with her van. 
Ardoin stated that the moped was running, that the engine was on
and running after the accident, and she saw keys in the ignition. 
Jenkins also told her, when she asked about insurance, "that the
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
moped wasn't his."  Mark Ching testified that on September 14,
2016, he saw Jenkins run a stop sign, drive in front of a white
van, and get struck by the van.  When the evidence is viewed in
the light most favorable to the prosecution, Jenkins operated a
vehicle that was self-propelled.  Therefore, the District Court
did not err by denying Jenkins's motion for judgment of
acquittal.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of
Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment filed on
March 17, 2017 in the District Court of the First Circuit,
Honolulu Division is affirmed.
