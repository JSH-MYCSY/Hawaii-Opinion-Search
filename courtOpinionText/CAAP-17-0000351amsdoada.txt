v. 
GAREN B. WINHAM, also known as GAREN B.M. WINHAM,
GAREN B. WINWARD, GAREN BERNICE MAILE WINHAM,
Defendant-Appellee. 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CRIMINAL NO. 16-1-1356) 
AMENDED SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Chan, JJ.)  
Plaintiff-Appellant State of Hawai# i (State) appeals 
from the "Findings of Fact [(FOF)], Conclusions of Law [(COL)] 
and Order Granting Defendant's Motion to Dismiss/Strike Second Offense Criminal DUI Charge from Count I of the Complaint Filed August 22, 2016, Filed on January 9, 2017," filed March 17, 2017, (Order) in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit court).

On July 29, 2016, State charged Defendant-Appellee 
Garen B. Winham (Winham) in the District Court of the First Circuit (district court) with, inter alia, Count I, Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII) in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1) (Supp. 2016) 
1 The Honorable Christine E. Kuriyama presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
and/or (a)(3) (Supp. 2016) with additional sentencing under HRS § 
291E-61(b)(2) (Supp. 2016) "where the instant offense was committed within five years of a prior conviction for an offense under Section 291E-61 or Section 291E-4(a) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes." On August 16, 2016, the case was committed to the circuit court for a jury trial. 
On January 9, 2017, prior to trial, Winham filed 
Defendant's Motion to Dismiss/Strike Second Offense Criminal DUI Charge from Count 1 of the Complaint (Motion to Dismiss), requesting the circuit court dismiss the second offense language from Count I because her prior OVUII conviction was not a "final, valid conviction" on the date of the instant OVUII offense. Specifically, Winham argued that her earlier OVUII conviction was not a "prior conviction" because at the time of the instant OVUII offense, the district court had only entered a partial sentence, not a valid, final judgment, for the prior offense. Winham argued that the district court did not enter the full sentence and final judgment of conviction for the purposes of HRS § 291E-61(b)(2) until after Winham's second OVUII incident. On March 17, 2017, the circuit court entered its Order granting Winham's Motion to Dismiss on this basis and the State timely appealed. 
On appeal, the State raises a single point of error 
challenging the circuit court's COL 4-15 in the Order. The State contends that the circuit court erred in concluding that the district court's judgment of guilt and partial sentencing in Winham's prior OVUII case did not become a "prior conviction" for the purposes of HRS § 291E-61(b)(2) until the district court completed sentencing. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve the State's point of error as follows. 
On appeal, 
[t]his court reviews the trial court's COLs de novo . A COL 
is not binding upon an appellate court and is freely
reviewable for its correctness. Moreover, a COL that is 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
supported by the trial court's FOFs and that reflects an
application of the correct rule of law will not beoverturned. 
Bhakta v. Cty. of Maui, 109 Hawai# i 198, 208, 124 P.3d 943, 953 
(2005) (internal citations, brackets, and quotation marks 
omitted). 
Further, "[t]he interpretation of a statute is a 
question of law reviewable de novo." State v. Arceo, 84 
Hawai# i 
1, 10, 928 P.2d 843, 852 (1996) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
This court's construction of statutes is guided by
established rules: 
First, the fundamental starting point for statutoryinterpretation is the language of the statute itself.Second, where the statutory language is plain andunambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to itsplain and obvious meaning. Third, implicit in thetask of statutory construction is our foremostobligation to ascertain and give effect to theintention of the legislature, which is to be obtainedprimarily from the language contained in the statuteitself. Fourth, when there is doubt, doubleness ofmeaning, or indistinctiveness or uncertainty of anexpression used in a statute, an ambiguity exists. 
When there is ambiguity in a statute, the meaning of theambiguous words may be sought by examining the context, withwhich the ambiguous words, phrases, and sentences may becompared, in order to ascertain their true meaning.Moreover, the courts may resort to extrinsic aids indetermining legislative intent, such as legislative history,or the reason and spirit of the law. 
State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai# i 383, 390, 219 P.3d 1170, 1177 
(2009) (block quotation format altered) (internal quotation marks 
and citation omitted). 
The Supreme Court of Hawai# i has held that: 
the plain language rule of statutory construction[ ] does
not preclude an examination of sources other than thelanguage of the statute itself even when the languageappears clear upon perfunctory review. Were this not the case, a court may be unable to adequately discern theunderlying policy which the legislature seeks to promulgateand, thus, would be unable to determine if a literalconstruction would produce an absurd or unjust result,inconsistent with the policies of the statute.

Hawai# i 14,

statutory language in the context of the entire statute and 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
construe it in a manner consistent with its purpose. State v. 
Toyomura, 80 Hawai# i 8, 18-19, 904 P.2d 893, 903-04 (1995). 
This case turns on the definition of "prior conviction" 
in HRS § 291E-61(g) which we review de novo.  The relevant sections of HRS § 291E-61 state: 
(b) A person committing the offense of operating a vehicle
under the influence of an intoxicant shall be sentenced without
possibility of probation or suspension of sentence as follows:. . . (2) For an offense that occurs within five years of aprior conviction for an offense under this section orsection 291E-4(a): (A) Revocation for not less than eighteen months normore than two years of license and privilege tooperate a vehicle during the revocation periodand installation during the revocation period ofan ignition interlock device on any vehicleoperated by the person;
(B) Either one of the following:(i) Not less than two hundred forty hours ofcommunity service work; or
(ii) Not less than five days but not more thanthirty days of imprisonment, of which atleast forty-eight hours shall be servedconsecutively;
(C) A fine of not less than $500 but not more than $1,500;
(D) A surcharge of $25 to be deposited into theneurotrauma special fund; and
(E) A surcharge of up to $50 if the court so orders,to be deposited into the trauma system specialfund; 
. . . . (g) Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, any:
(1) Conviction under this section, section 291E-4(a), orsection 291E-61.5;
(2) Conviction in any other state or federal jurisdictionfor an offense that is comparable to operating orbeing in physical control of a vehicle while havingeither an unlawful alcohol concentration or an unlawful drug content in the blood or urine or whileunder the influence of an intoxicant or habituallyoperating a vehicle under the influence of anintoxicant; or
(3) Adjudication of a minor for a law violation that, ifcommitted by an adult, would constitute a violation ofthis section or an offense under section 291E-4(a), orsection 291E-61.5,
shall be considered a prior conviction for the purposes ofimposing sentence under this section. 
Any judgment on a verdict
or a finding of guilty, a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, or anadjudication, in the case of a minor, that at the time of theoffense has not been expunged by pardon, reversed, or set asideshall be deemed a prior conviction under this section. 
(Emphases added). 
The definition of "prior conviction" provided in HRS § 
291E-61(g), 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
[a]ny judgment on a verdict or a finding of guilty, a plea
of guilty or nolo contendere, or an adjudication, in thecase of a minor, that at the time of the offense has notbeen expunged by pardon, reversed, or set aside shall bedeemed a prior conviction under this section[,] 
(emphasis added) expands the definition of "conviction" 
previously used by the Hawai# i Supreme Court when interpreting 
the predecessor statute to HRS § 291E-61(g): 
[t]he final judgment on a verdict or finding of guilty, a
plea of guilty, or a plea of nolo contendere, but does notinclude a final judgment which has been expunged by pardon,reversed, set aside, or otherwise rendered nugatory. 
State v. Shimabukuro, 100 Hawai# i 324, 326, 60 P.3d 274, 276 
(2002) (emphasis added) (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 333-34 
(6th ed. 1990) (1990 Black's Law Definition)). 
Thus, on a plain 
language reading of the statute, countable judgments are no longer limited to "final" judgments; and the only types of judgments that may not be counted for purposes of imposing enhanced sentencing for prior convictions are those judgments that, at the time of the offense, have been expunged by pardon, reversed, or set aside. 
The legislature's intent to expand Shimabukuro's 
definition of "conviction" (which was based on the 1990 Black's Law Definition) in creating the modern statute is apparent and a critical factor that distinguishes our interpretation of HRS § 291E-61(g) from that reached by the circuit court in this case. The circuit court's analysis relied on more recent versions of Black's Law Dictionary to redefine the terms contained in HRS § 291E-61(g) contrary to the plain meaning of the statutory definition and its manifest purpose as intended by the legislature. 
Tracing the provenance of the modern amended statutory 
definition is instructive. 
In 1985, the Hawai# i Supreme Court 
first addressed the definition of "conviction" in criminal statutes that lacked a specific definition of the term, holding generally that "[t]he meaning of the term 'convicted' or 'conviction' varies according to the context in which it appears and the purpose to which it relates." 
State v. Akana, 68 Haw. 
164, 167, 706 P.2d 1300, 1303 (1985). 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
In 2002, in Shimabukuro, the Hawai# i Supreme Court 
cited the 1990 Black's Law Definition for the definition of 
conviction, stating that: 
[g]enerally, a conviction is defined as "[t]he final
judgment on a verdict or finding of guilty, a plea ofguilty, or a plea of nolo contendere, but does not include afinal judgment which has been expunged by pardon, reversed,set aside, or otherwise rendered nugatory." 
Shimabukuro, 100 Hawai# i at 326, 60 P.3d at 276. The supreme 
court also echoed its previous recognition of the difference 
between the common and technical definitions of the term and held that, in the predecessor statute to HRS § 291E-61, "convicted" meant a "prior valid DUI conviction." Id. at 326-27, 60 P.3d at 276-77 (quoting Akana, 68 Haw. at 166-67, 706 P.2d at 1303). 
In 2003, after the decision in Shimabukuro, the Hawaii 
State Legislature amended HRS chapter 291E to establish the language in the modern statute by adding an explicit, expanded definition of "prior conviction" (now HRS § 291E-61(g)). 2003 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 71, §§ 1, 3 at 123-26 (Act 71). 
This expansion was acknowledged by the Supreme Court of 
Hawai# i
 later in 2003 when it distinguished the divided court's 
holding in Shimabukuro that a conviction must be "valid" to count for purposes of the predecessor statute to HRS § 291E-61. State v.
Veikoso, 102 Hawai# i 219, 222, 74 P.3d 575, 578 (2003). 
Relying on the general definition of "conviction" in Black's Law Dictionary (and noting the soon to be in force definition of HRS § 291E-61(g)), id. at 220 n.2, 74 P.3d at 576 n.2, Veikoso expanded the definition of "conviction," as used in the predecessor statute to HRS § 291E-61, holding that: 2
the term "conviction," as used in HRS § 291–4.4, means any
judgment or plea that has not been expunged by pardon,reversed, or set aside at the time a defendant is foundguilty of the habitual DUI charge. 
Id. at 223, 74 P.3d at 579 (citing Black's Law Dictionary, 333–34 
2 Shimabukuro is the only legal authority Winham provides on appeal in
support of her interpretation of HRS § 291E-61(g). As discussed, Shimabukurois inapposite because it interprets an extinct version of HRS § 291E-61 thatlacks an explicit definition of a "prior conviction," and because Shimabukurowas distinguished on this issue by Veikoso. 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
(6th ed. 1990)). 
The operative difference between the Shimabukuro and 
Veikoso definitions is the modern statute's replacement of the 
word "final" with the word "any" with regards to the types of judgments that count for a showing of prior convictions. 
The legislature is presumed to know the law when it 
enacts statutes, including decisions by the Supreme Court of Hawai# i and any definitions the court has assigned to particular 
words. See Peer News LLC v. City & Cty. of Honolulu, 138 
Hawai# i 
53, 69 376 P.3d 1, 17 (2016) (citations omitted). Here, the legislature in HRS § 291E-61(g) explicitly removed the requirement that a prior conviction stem from a "final" judgment. 
This reading of HRS § 291E-61(g) is supported by the 
floor testimony and committee reports which reflect the legislature's intent to make habitually operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant a status offense that applies as widely as possible. 
The Senate Standing Committee Report states: 
The purpose of this measure is to establish a status
offense of habitually operating a vehicle under the
influence of an intoxicant . . . . 
Your Committee finds that being punished as a status
offender rather than receiving an enhanced sentence hasdistinct implications. Status offenders receive a specificpunishment as long as the offender meets the criteria at thetime the offender reoffends. The offender cannot defeat the charge by having a previous conviction reversed on asubsequent appeal. By contrast, enhanced sentences can beavoided if any prior convictions that are the basis for anenhanced sentence are overturned. 
Your Committee believes it is important that the
habitually impaired driver understand that he or she will becharged with a felony for any further impaired drivingarrests, even if one of their prior convictions is reversedafter their arrest. 
S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1268, in 2003 Senate Journal, at 1564.3 
3 Act 71, which amended HRS chapter 291E to create the modern language
in HRS § 291E-61 and -61.5, was composed of House Bill 807 and its companionSenate Bill 1105. Several Senate amendments to other provisions of HRS § 291Ewere rejected by the Conference Committee, however, the portions of the billrelated to the new offense of habitually operating a vehicle under theinfluence of an intoxicant were substantively identical to those in the finalversion. See S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1268, in 2003 Senate Journal, at 1564;
Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 18, in 2003 House Journal, at 1706-07, 2003 Senate
Journal, at 953-54. 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Further, the Conference Committee Report reflects: 
The purpose of this bill is to increase public safety
on our roadways by:
(1) Establishing the status offense of "habitually
operating a vehicle while under the influence of an
intoxicant"; . . . . 
Your Committee on Conference finds that a 
habitually-impaired driver poses a risk while operating amotor vehicle. Charging a habitually-impaired driver with afelony offense will serve to deter persons from drivingwhile intoxicated. 
Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 18, in 2003 House Journal, at 1706-07, 2003 
Senate Journal, at 953-54. 
In the committee reports, the legislature states its 
intention to deter habitually-impaired drivers via the "distinct implications" of a status offense. The legislature was concerned that drivers could defeat a charge of habitually driving under the influence, or reduce any enhanced sentencing, by having a previous conviction reversed on a later appeal. Accordingly, the legislature wanted a statutory scheme wherein a successful charge of habitually-impaired driving requires only a count of the number of prior convictions at the time of the arrest. The legislature accomplished this by creating a status offense which merely counts the number of currently valid judgments of guilt at the time of sentencing. 
Here, on June 22, 2016, the district court filed its 
"Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment" (6/22/2016 Judgment) after it found Winham guilty of a previous OVUII offense in violation of HRS § 291E-61 which occurred on January 30, 2016. The 6/22/2016 Judgment sentenced Winham to pay a $150 fine, $212 in additional fines and fees, substance abuse assessment and treatment, and complete a minimum of 14 hours of AARP driver education. Because Winham's driver's license was the subject of an administrative hearing on its potential revocation, the judge ordered further sentencing to occur on August 15, 2016, regarding the disposition of Winham's driver's license. 
On July 4, 2016, Winham was again stopped for OVUII and 
charged in the instant case on July 29, 2016, prior to returning to court for the completion of her sentencing for her prior OVUII 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
offense on August 15, 2016, as ordered in the 6/22/2016 Judgment. 
At the time of the July 4, 2016 incident, the district 
court had already filed its 6/22/2016 Judgment finding Winham 
guilty of OVUII in violation of HRS § 291E-61 for the January 30, 2016 incident. At the time of the July 4, 2016 incident, the 6/22/2016 Judgment had not been expunged by pardon, reversed, or set aside. Regardless of the 6/22/2016 Judgment's disposition of sentencing issues, or lack of status as a final appealable judgment, the 6/22/2016 Judgment was clearly a judgment on "a finding of guilty" as required to trigger a status offense under HRS § 291E-61(b)(2). 
Based on the foregoing, we vacate the "Findings of 
Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting Defendant's Motion to Dismiss/Strike Second Offense Criminal DUI Charge from Count I of the Complaint Filed August 22, 2016, Filed on January 9, 2017," filed March 17, 2017, in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit and remand this case for trial to allow the State to prove OVUII as a second offense.
