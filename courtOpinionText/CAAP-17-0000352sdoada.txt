IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I  
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
TAYLOR D. DYKAS, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-16-00316)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Reifurth and Chan, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai
'i (Hawaii) charged 
Defendant-Appellant Taylor D. Dykas (Dykas) with operating a 
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant (OVUII). After a bench trial, the District Court of the First Circuit (District Court)
1 found Dykas guilty as charged. The District Court 
entered its Judgment on March 28, 2017. 
The sole argument raised by Dykas on appeal is that her
 
conviction must be vacated because the District Court's
 advisement pursuant to Tachibana v. State, 79 Hawaii 226, 900
 P.2d 1293 (1995), was defective. As explained below, we conclude
 that the deficiency in the District Court's Tachibana advisement
 was harmless. We therefore affirm the District Court's Judgment.

I.
 
Prior to trial, the District Court advised Dykas of her
 
right to testify and her right not to testify as follows:
 
THE COURT: . . . . Ms. Dykas, you understand that you
have a constitutional right to testify?
 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes.
 
THE COURT: You understand if you choose to testify in
this case, you are subject to cross-examination?
 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes.
 THE COURT: You understand that ultimately it is your
decision and your decision alone as to whether you'd like to
testify or not testify in this case?
 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes.
 
THE COURT: While I will give you time to speak with
your attorney about whether or not you'd like to testify,
ultimately it is your choice.
 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes
 
THE COURT: And no one can force you to testify if you
do not want to testify in this case. Do you understand
that?
 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes.
 
THE COURT: In addition you have a constitutional right
not to testify. Do you understand that?
 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, Your Honor.
 THE COURT: You understand if you choose not to
testify, the court cannot and will not use that against you
in determining the outcome of the case?
 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes.
 
THE COURT: You understand if you choose not to
testify, the State cannot ask you questions and you cannot
be forced to testify? Do you understand that?
 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes.
 
THE COURT: I'll give you time to make the final
decision. Do you have any questions about your right to
testify?
 
THE DEFENDANT: No.
 
The State completed the direct examination of its first
 
witness and a recess was called. Trial resumed two months later. 
After the State rested, the defense indicated that it planned to

rest without calling any witnesses. The District Court then held
 
the following colloquy with Dykas:
 
THE COURT: Before the defense rests let me briefly -Â­
. . . -- go over Ms. Dykas's right to testify as well as her
right not to testify.
 
Ms. Dykas, you understand that you have a
constitutional right to testify in your own defense?
 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes.
 
THE COURT: You understand that if you choose to
testify in this case, you would be subject to
cross-examination?
 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes.
 
THE COURT: You understand that if you choose to
testify in this case, no one, including your attorney, can
stop you from testifying?
 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes.
 
THE COURT: Have you had an opportunity to speak with
your attorney about whether or not you would like to
testify?
 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes.
 
THE COURT: You understand you also have a
constitutional right not to testify?
 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes.
 THE COURT: You understand that if you choose not to
testify in this case, you are not subject to
cross-examination and no one can ask -- no one can require
you to answer questions under oath?
 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes.
 
THE COURT: You understand that if you choose not to
testify, no one can force you to testify including your own
attorney?
 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes.
 
THE COURT: Have you had an opportunity to discuss with
your attorney your right not to testify.
 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes.
 THE COURT: Have you made a decision about whether you
would like to testify or not testify in this case?
 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes. I do not want to testify.
 THE COURT: Whose decision is that?
 THE DEFENDANT: My decision.
 
3
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
THE COURT: Did anyone force you, threaten you, or
coerce you to make that decision?
 
THE DEFENDANT: No.
 
THE COURT: Do you have any questions about your right
to testify.
 
THE DEFENDANT: No, I do not.
 THE COURT: Do you have any questions about your right
not to testify?
 
THE DEFENDANT: No, I do not.
 THE COURT: Thank you.
 
Dykas did not testify and the defense rested. 
II.
 
Dykas contends that her waiver of her right to testify 
was invalid because the District Court's end-of-trial Tachibana 
advisement failed to inform her of her "privilege [against] self-incrimination" -- that no adverse inference could be drawn by the trier of fact if she did not testify. See Tachibana, 79 Hawai' i 
at 236 n.7, 900 P.2d at 1303 n.7. 
It is clear from the record that the District Court's
 
end-of-trial advisements omitted the advisement that no adverse
 inference could be drawn by the District Court if Dykas did not
 testify. We conclude that this omission was harmless.
 
Dykas did not testify at trial. She does not challenge
 
the propriety of the District Court's advisements regarding her
 right to testify, which she waived by not testifying. The
 omitted advisement did not affect her right to testify because
 her knowing that there would be no adverse consequences from her
 failure to testify would not have caused or influenced her to
 testify. The omitted advisement did not affect her right not to
 testify, which she exercised by not testifying.
2 The omitted
 
2Because an advisement that no adverse inference could be
 
drawn from a defendant's failure to testify would make it more
likely that the defendant would not testify, if Dykas had
received this advisement, it would not have altered her decision
not to testify, but would only have served to reinforce that
decision.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
advisement had no effect on Dykas' decision not to testify in
 
this case, and thus the deficiency in the Tachibana advisements
 was harmless error.
 
Dykas also claims that the District Court failed to
 
engage her in a "true colloquy." The record refutes this claim
 and we reject it.
 
III.
 
Based on the foregoing, we affirm Dykas' OVUII
 
conviction and the District Court's Judgment.
