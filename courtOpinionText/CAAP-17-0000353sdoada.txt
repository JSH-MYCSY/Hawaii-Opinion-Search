NO. CAAP-17-0000353
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
RACHEL A. SCHACK, Petitioner-Appellee, v.
MARK-ALEX V. KASSEBEER, Respondent-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(FC-DA NO. 17-1-0481)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, and Leonard, J.;
and Ginoza, Chief Judge, concurring and dissenting)
Respondent-Appellant Mark-Alex V. Kassebeer ( Kassebeer )
appeals from an April 3, 2017 Order for Protection (Order),
issued by the Family Court of the First Circuit ( Family Court).1 
The Order prohibits Kassebeer from, among other things,
contacting his ex-girlfriend, Petitioner-Appellee Rachel A.
Schack ( Schack), for one year from the date of the Order.
Kassebeer contends that the Family Court's conclusion
that he committed "domestic abuse" was based on insufficient
evidence.  We disagree.  Schack testified that when she tried to

intervene after Kassebeer put her boyfriend ( Boyfriend ) in a
headlock and slammed his head into the door frame, Kassebeer
shoved her into a wall.  The evidence was sufficient to show that
Kassebeer's actions constituted "domestic abuse" as defined in
Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) ยง 586-1 (2006), which includes
"[p]hysical harm, bodily injury, assault or the threat of
imminent physical harm, bodily injury, or assault. . . between
family or household members."  See also HRS ยง 586-3(c) (2006);
Kie v. McMahel, 91 Hawai# i 438, 442, 444, 984 P.2d 1264, 1268,
1270 (App. 1999); and Coyle v. Compton, 85 Hawai# i 197, 203, 940
P.2d 404, 410 (App. 1997).
However, we agree with Kassebeer's further assertion
that the Family Court erred when it concluded that the Order was
necessary to prevent a recurrence of abuse.  There was no
evidence of any abuse prior to or after the incident.  Further,
no evidence was adduced to show that Kassebeer knew or should
have known, prior to going to Schack's apartment, that he was
unwelcome there.  Schack testified that she had tried, off and on
since Kassebeer moved out, to have Kassebeer "come pick [his
poster] up."  It is undisputed that the parties were on good
terms until the day of the incident, when Schack sensed Kassebeer
was upset because she contacted his grandmother to ask if she
could take the poster to the grandmother's house.  When Kassebeer
called to say he would pick up the poster, she told him not to,
but when he said he was already on his way, she replied, "Okay,
fine."  She did not specifically tell him not to go to her
apartment until he was already at her door.

Next, Schack testified that the building usually was
secure, but Kassebeer was able to enter freely on that day
because the lobby door had been propped open to allow for
construction work.  No evidence was adduced that the construction
was ongoing or that the door would be left open in the future for
some other reason. 
Last, the only reason Kassebeer visited the apartment
was to retrieve his belongings, which were returned to him. 
There is no evidence showing Kassebeer had any motivation or
inclination to return, such as to retrieve additional personal
items.  It is undisputed that Kassebeer harbored no ill will
toward Boyfriend, who had moved into the apartment after he left. 
There is no evidence that the parties contacted each other or
that Schack contacted Kassebeer's grandmother after the incident.
There is no evidence in the record, and no reasonable
inferences could be drawn from the evidence, to support a
conclusion that the incident was anything other than an isolated
event.  Accordingly, we conclude that the Family Court erred when
it found that the Order was necessary to prevent a reoccurrence
of abuse.  See HRS ยง 586-5.5(a) (2006).  See also Peck v. Kuiper ,
No. CAAP-11-0000806, 2013 WL 966956 (App. Mar. 12, 2013) (sdo);
Cf. Lite v. McClure , No. 29107, 2009 WL 1263099 (App. May 8,
2009) (sdo); and Levi v. Gordon, No. CAAP-13-0001076, 2015 WL
4549742 (App. Jul. 28, 2015) (sdo).  Thus, the court abused its
discretion by granting the Petition.
