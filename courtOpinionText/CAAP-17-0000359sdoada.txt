KRYSTAL KAHANA, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(HONOLULU DIVISION)
(CASE NO. 1DTA-16-02281)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Krystal Kahana ( Kahana) appeals
from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and
Plea/Judgment, filed on March 10, 2017, and Notice of Entry of
Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, filed on April 10, 2017
(collectively, April 10, 2017 Judgment), in the District Court of
the First Circuit, Honolulu Division (District Court ).1  Kahana
was convicted of Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an

Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS)
ยง 291E-61(a)(1) (Supp. 2017).2
On appeal, Kahana raises two points of error,
contending that:  (1) the District Court erred by denying her
August 12, 2016 motion to suppress because she was not advised of
her Miranda  rights and did not waive her Miranda rights while
being subjected to custodial interrogation during a traffic stop;
and (2) there was insufficient evidence to convict her.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve Kahana's points of error as follows:
(1)  Kahana claims that her statements that she had
some drinks earlier in the night, her agreement to participate in
field sobriety tests, her answers to medical rule-out questions,
her response that she understood the instructions to the field
sobriety tests and had no questions, and Officer Jared Spiker's
(Officer Spiker ) observations of her performance on the field
sobriety tests should have been suppressed. Kahana does not
dispute, however, that she was initially pulled over pursuant to
a valid traffic stop after Officer Spiker observed her vehicle
2 HRS ยง 291E-61(a)(1) states:
ยง291E-61  Operating a vehicle under the influence of
an intoxicant.  (a)  A person commits the offense of
operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if
the person operates or assumes actual physical control of a
vehicle:
(1) While under the influence of alcohol in an
amount sufficient to impair the person's normal
mental faculties or ability to care for the
person and guard against casualty; . . .

straddling two lanes for five to ten seconds without signaling
and she had an expired safety check.3  
A defendant is not in custody for purposes of Miranda
merely because he or she has been pulled over pursuant to a valid
traffic stop.  State v. Kaleohano, 99 Hawai# i 370, 376, 56 P.3d
138, 144 (2002).  Here, Kahana was not in custody merely by
virtue of being pulled over during a traffic stop.  Accordingly,
Kahana was not subjected to custodial interrogation prior to or
while performing the standardized field sobriety tests;
therefore, she was not required to be advised of her rights under
Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), based on these
circumstances alone. 
In addition, Kahana admits that she consented to
participate in the field sobriety tests when asked by Officer
Spiker.  Officer Spiker did not order Kahana to exit her vehicle
to perform the field sobriety tests.  Under the totality of the
circumstances, we conclude that Kahana was not in custody based
on the time, place, and length of the interrogation, the nature
of the questions asked, the conduct of the police at the time of
the interrogation because she consented to participate in the
field sobriety tests.  State v. Kazanas , 138 Hawai #i 23, 35, 375
P.3d 1261, 1273 (2016).  
3Kahana cites State v. Tsujimura, 140 Hawai #i 299, 400 P.3d 500
(2017), for the proposition that her post-seizure statements and non-verbal
communicative responses were obtained in violation of her right to remain
silent.  In Tsujimura, the supreme court held that a person has the right to
remain silent before an arrest is made.  Id. at 310-11, 400 P.3d 511-12. 
Tsujimura, however, is distinguishable because, in that case, the issue was
whether the defendant's pre-arrest silence could be used against him
substantively as an implication of guilt, not whether non-custodial, pre-
arrest statements made by a defendant can be used as evidence.  
Id. at 311-14,
400 P.3d at 512-15.
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
In order for a defendant's statements to be admitted
into evidence, it need not be shown that the defendant was
advised of his or her rights, if the defendant's statements are
not the product of custodial interrogation.  Kaleohano , 99
Hawai#i at 377-78, 56 P.3d at 145-46.  As stated above, Kahana
was not in custody and, thus, she was not subjected to custodial
interrogation which required advisement of her Miranda  rights. 
Therefore, her statements to Officer Spiker were admissible.
Admission of Kahana's performance on the standardized
field sobriety tests does not violate her right against self-
incrimination.  The right against self-incrimination is not
necessarily implicated whenever a person suspected of criminal
activity is compelled in some way to cooperate in developing
evidence which may be used against him or her.  State v. Wyatt,
67 Haw. 293, 302, 687 P.2d 544, 551 (1984).  In Wyatt, the court
stated that observations of a defendant's performance on field
sobriety tests was an exhibition of physical characteristics of
coordination.  Id. at 303, 687 P.2d at 551.  Thus, the Wyatt
court held that since the performance on field sobriety tests was
not communication nor testimony, the trial court did not err by
refusing to suppress the field sobriety test observations.  Id.
at 301-03, 687 P.2d at 550-51.  For these reasons, we conclude
that Kahana's first point of error is without merit.
(2)  Kahana contends that, absent the erroneously
admitted observations of her performance on the standardized
field sobriety tests, there was not substantial evidence to
support her conviction.  However, we have concluded that the
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
District Court did not err by refusing to suppress observations
of Kahana's actions and statements to Officer Spiker.  
Officer Spiker observed Kahana straddle two lanes for
five to ten seconds while driving on Ke'eaumoku Street, which is
a public way, street, road, or highway in the County of Honolulu,
State of Hawai #i.  Officer Spiker noticed Kahana had a strong
odor of alcohol on her breath and glassy and watery eyes.  During
the horizontal gaze nystagmus test, Kahana turned her head three
times despite being instructed not to do so.  While Officer
Spiker explained the walk-and-turn test, Kahana could not keep
her balance.  During the walk-and-turn test, Kahana missed one
heel-toe during the nine steps forward and stepped off the line,
picked up her feet during a turn, missed one heel-toe during the
nine steps back and stepped off the line, and failed to audibly
count nine steps in each direction, all contrary to Officer
Spiker's instructions.  During the one-leg stand test, Kahana's
body swayed side to side about two inches.  She also raised her
arms more than six inches and put her foot down twice, contrary
to the instructions.  
When the evidence adduced in the trial court is
considered in the strongest light for the prosecution, State v.
Matavale, 115 Hawai #i 149, 157-58, 166 P.3d 322, 330-31 (2007),
we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to support
Kahana's conviction.
