APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 14-1-0382)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Chan, JJ.)
Defendants-Appellants Justin Ryan Kapono Fergerstrom
and Akiko Watari Fergerstrom (collectively the Fergerstroms)
appeal from the "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Order
Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and Decree of
Foreclosure Against All Defendants on Complaint FiledNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
February 11, 2014" (Order Granting Summary Judgment) and the
"Judgment on Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Order Granting
Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure
Against All Defendants on Complaint Filed February 11, 2014"
(Judgment) both entered on March 23, 2017, by the Circuit Court
of the First Circuit (circuit court).1  The Order Granting
Summary Judgment and Judgment were entered in favor of Plaintiff-
Appellee U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee for
Structured Asset Investment Loan Trust, Mortgage Pass-Through
Certificates, Series 2006-1 (U.S. Bank).
On appeal, the Fergerstroms contend that the circuit
court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of U.S. Bank
because (1) U.S. Bank failed to prove that it was entitled to
enforce the note at the commencement of the foreclosure
proceeding and (2) the Declaration of Vanna D. Tipton (Tipton)
was not sufficient, as a custodian of records or qualified
witness to authenticate certain documents including the note and
mortgage.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve the
Fergerstroms' points on appeal as follows, and vacate and remand.
In order to establish a right to foreclose, the
foreclosing plaintiff must prove that it has standing, or
entitlement to enforce the subject note, at the time the action
was commenced.  Bank of America, N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 139
Hawai#i 361, 367-70, 390 P.3d 1248, 1254-57 (2017).
In order to prove entitlement to foreclose, the foreclosing
party must demonstrate that all conditions precedent to
foreclose under the note and mortgage are satisfied and that
all steps required by statute have been strictly complied
with.  See 55 Am. Jur. 2d Mortgages § 575 (Nov. 2016
Update).  This typically requires the plaintiff to prove the
existence of an agreement, the terms of the agreement, a
default by the mortgagor under the terms of the agreement,
and giving of the cancellation notice.  See Bank of
1The Honorable Bert I. Ayabe presided.

Honolulu, N.A. v. Anderson, 3 Haw. App. 545, 551,654 P.2d
1370, 1375 (1982) (citing 55 Am. Jur. 2d Mortgages  § 554
(1971)).  A foreclosing plaintiff must also prove its
entitlement to enforce the note and mortgage.
Id., 139 Hawai #i 361, 367, 390 P.3d 1248, 1254 (2017) (further
citations omitted).  In Reyes-Toledo, the Hawai# i Supreme Court
held that although the foreclosing bank produced evidence that it
possessed the blank-indorsed note at the time it moved for
summary judgment, a genuine issue of material fact existed as to
whether the bank possessed the note, or was a holder of the note,
at the time it brought the foreclosure proceeding.  Id.  at 370-
71, 390 P.3d at 1257-58 ("Here, there is no evidence in the
record, either through the Note itself, the [Declaration of the
custodian of records or other qualified witness], or the other
documents attached to the motion for summary judgment, showing
that the blank indorsement on the Note occurred prior to the
initiation of the suit.").
In this case, the circuit court granted U.S. Bank's
motion for summary judgment and decree of foreclosure.  In
support of its motion for summary judgment, U.S. Bank attached
several documents in seeking to demonstrate its entitlement to
enforce the note, including, inter alia : (1) Tipton's Declaration
executed on January 12, 2016, attesting that U.S. Bank "is in
possession of the Promissory Note AND The Promissory Note
includes an Allonge indorsed in blank"; (2) the Balloon Note
("Note"), executed on October 26, 2005, which shows that it was
indorsed in blank by way of an Allonge attached to the Note; and
(3) an attorney affirmation executed by counsel for U.S. Bank in
compliance with Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 667-17 (2012)2
affirming that counsel had verified the accuracy of the
2  HRS § 667-17 (2012) provides, in relevant part, that:
Any attorney who files on behalf of a mortgagee seeking to
foreclose on a residential property under this part shall
sign and submit an affirmation that the attorney has
verified the accuracy of the documents submitted, under
penalty of perjury and subject to applicable rules of
professional conduct.

documents.3  Similar to Reyes-Toledo, this evidence fails to
demonstrate that U.S. Bank was entitled to enforce the Note at
the time the action commenced.
Additionally, there is no other evidence in the record
to establish U.S. Bank's entitlement to enforce the Note when it
commenced the foreclosure proceeding.  The Complaint for
Foreclosure alleges that "[U.S. Bank] is the holder of the
Note[.]"  However, the Note and blank-indorsed Allonge were not
attached to the complaint nor is there any verification or other
evidence submitted verifying that U.S. Bank held the Note and
Allonge at the time the complaint was filed.
Thus, viewing the facts and inferences in the light
most favorable to the Fergerstroms, there is a genuine issue of
material fact as to whether U.S. Bank held the Note at the time
it filed the complaint.  As such, the circuit court erred in
granting U.S. Bank's motion for summary judgment.  In light of
this ruling, we need not address the Fergerstroms' argument with
respect to whether Tipton, as servicing agent for U.S. Bank, is
the proper custodian of records or qualified witness for purposes
of authenticating the Note and mortgage.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Findings of
Fact, Conclusions of Law, Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for
Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure Against All Defendants
on Complaint Filed February 11, 2014" and the "Judgment on
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Order Granting Plaintiff's
Motion for Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure Against All
Defendants on Complaint Filed February 11, 2014" both entered on
3  HRS § 667-17 was amended in 2014, effective April 23, 2014, requiring
the affirmation to be filed with the court at the time the action is
commenced.  2014 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 37, § 1 at 87.  The subject foreclosure
action was commenced, with the filing of the Complaint for Foreclosure, on
February 11, 2014, prior to the effective date of the 2014 amendment,
therefore, the attorney affirmation, which was attached to U.S. Bank's motion
for summary judgment, was not untimely.  In any event, however, it appears
that in Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Behrendt, SCAP-16-0000645, 2018 WL 1325153
(Haw. Mar. 15, 2018) an attorney affirmation in the record in that case was
not given any evidentiary merit.  See Wilmington Sav. Fund Soc. v. Yasuda, No.
CAAP-17-0000433, 2018 WL 1904909 (Haw. App. Apr. 23, 2018) (SDO) (Ginoza, J.,
concurring).
