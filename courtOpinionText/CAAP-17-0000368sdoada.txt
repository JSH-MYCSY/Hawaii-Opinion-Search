GW, Appellant-Appellant, v.
CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT AGENCY, STATE OF HAWAII,
and CK, Appellees-Appellees
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(FC-AP NO. 15-1-6011)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
Appellant-Appellant (Father) GW (GW ) appeals from the
Notice and Judgment on Appeal, filed on March 28, 2017, in the
Family Court of the First Circuit ( Family Court).1  GW also
challenges the Family Court's March 28, 2017 Decision Affirming
the Administrative Findings and Order Filed June 16, 2015
(Decision Affirming 2015 Administrative Order ).
On appeal, GW contends that Agency-Appellee Child
Support Enforcement Agency (CSEA) violated his Fifth Amendment
right against double jeopardy, that he has the right to request
modification of child support at any time, pursuant to Hawaii
Revised Statutes (HRS ) § 576E-10 (2006), and that in 2012, CSEA
1/  The Honorable R. Mark Browning presided.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
did not utilize his then-current income to calculate child
support, in violation of HRS §§ 576D-7(d) (2006)2 and 576E-15
(2006).3 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve GW's points of error as follows:
On June 4, 2002, the Family Court ordered GW to, inter
alia, pay $433 per month per child in child support.  It appears
that, on or about August 3, 2012, GW requested that CSEA modify
the amount of child support based on (and informed the agency of)
his anticipated incarceration.  GW also stated that his two
oldest children had attained the age of majority in 2011. 
Following an October 2, 2012 hearing, on October 10, 2012, a CSEA
Hearings Officer entered Administrative Findings and Order ( 2012
Administrative Order ).  The 2012 Administrative Order states that
the parties, CSEA, GW, and CK ( Mother), agreed to reduce child
2/  HRS § 576D-7(d) states:
(d)  The establishment of the guidelines or the
adoption of any modifications made to the guidelines set
forth in this section may constitute a change in
circumstances sufficient to permit review of the support
order.  A material change of circumstances will be presumed
if support as calculated pursuant to the guidelines is
either ten per cent greater or less than the support amount
in the outstanding support order.  The most current
guidelines shall be used to calculate the amount of the
child support obligation.
3/  HRS § 576E-15 states:
§576E-15  Guidelines to be followed.   When an
administrative order establishes or modifies the amount of
child support required to be paid by a party, the guidelines
established under section 576D-7 shall be applied, except
when exceptional circumstances warrant departure.  The most
current guidelines shall be used to calculate the amount of
the child support obligation.

support for the one remaining minor child to $216 per month from
October 1, 2012, to May 31, 2017, returning to $433 per month
beginning June 1, 2017, when it was anticipated that GW would be
released from federal prison.  No appeal was taken from the 2012
Administrative Order.
Apparently in response to a new request from GW to
CSEA, on or about April 10, 2015, CSEA sent GW and Mother a
proposed Administrative Findings and Order, dated April 10, 2015. 
In response, on April 20, 2015, GW submitted a Request for
Hearing, where he objected to child support and past-due support
because a substantial change had occurred on August 6, 2012, when
due to GW's incarceration, his monthly income was "reduced
drastically" to $10 per month.  
Following a May 26, 2015 hearing, on June 16, 2015, a
CSEA Hearings Officer entered Administrative Findings and Order
(2015 Administrative Order ).  The 2015 Administrative Order
states, inter alia, that in the 2012 Administrative Order, GW and
Mother agreed that child support would be temporarily reduced to
$216 per month from October 1, 2012 to May 31, 2017, and then
would revert back to $433 per month after GW's release from
prison, and that GW did not appeal the 2012 Administrative Order.
The Hearings Officer concluded that HRS § 576E-14(b) does not
allow retroactive modification of child support; rather, the
statute only allows modification of child support from the time a
request is served upon the parties.  The Hearings Officer also
noted that GW was incarcerated at the time of the 2012
Administrative Order, and the parties took his incarceration into
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
account when they agreed to the temporary reduction.  Thus, the
Hearings Officer concluded that GW's incarceration was not a
substantial and material change in circumstances, and denied his
request to modify child support.  
On July 23, 2015, GW filed a notice of appeal with the
Family Court.  On March 28, 2017, the Family Court entered the
Decision Affirming 2015 Administrative Order.  The Family Court
rejected GW's argument that, in 2012, the parties did not take
into consideration his negligible income while incarcerated,
pointing out that GW failed to provide a transcript or other
documentation supporting that argument.  On that basis, the
Family Court denied GW relief from the 2015 Administrative Order.
(1) In his appeal to this court, GW contends that
imposition of child support or the refusal to reduce child
support is a form of punishment due to his prior conviction,
which violates the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment
to the U.S. Constitution.  GW did not assert that imposition of
child support violated the Double Jeopardy Clause before the
Family Court.  Therefore, the point of error is waived.  See  Rule
28(b)(4) of the Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP ).  
Even if the point of error was not waived, the Double
Jeopardy Clause does not apply to child support.  "The double
jeopardy clause protects against three distinct abuses:  (1) a
second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal; (2) a
second prosecution for the same offense after conviction; and (3)
multiple punishments for the same offense."  Loui v. Bd. of Med.
Examiners, 78 Hawai #i 21, 25, 889 P.2d 705, 709 (1995) (citing
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
United States v. Halper, 490 U.S. 435, 440 (1989)).  Child
support is not a form of punishment related to a criminal
conviction and therefore does not implicate the Double Jeopardy
Clause.  
(2) GW cites HRS § 576E-10 and the 2012 Administrative
Order for the proposition that he may request modification of
child support at any time.  However, the ability to request a
modification does not relieve a party from his or her burden to
demonstrate that a modification is warranted.4  Indeed, it
appears that the modification that GW seeks is a retroactive
modification of child support obligations that have already
accrued.  However, HRS § 576E-14(b) (2006), concerning, inter
alia, modification of support order, provides:  
(b)  Only payments accruing subsequent to service of
the request on all parties may be modified , and only upon a
showing of a substantial and material change of
circumstances.  The agency shall not be stayed from
enforcement of the existing order pending the outcome of the
hearing on the request to modify.
(Emphasis added).
Thus, GW's child support cannot be modified
retroactively and the Family Court did not err in denying GW's
request for a retroactive modification.  In addition, the
circumstances of GW's incarceration and negligible income existed
at the time of the 2012 Administrative Order and therefore was
not a material change of circumstances.  Therefore, the Family
4/  HRS § 576E-14(d) (2006) provides that "[t]he responsible parent or
custodial parent shall have a right to petition the family court or the child
support enforcement agency not more than once every three years for review and
adjustment of the child support order without having to show a change in
circumstances."  Here, however, GW requested modification to the October 2012
Administrative Order in April 2015, in less than three years. 
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Court did not abuse its discretion in denying GW's request for a
modification based on GW's incarceration and negligible income.
(3) GW argues that CSEA erred by not utilizing his
income while incarcerated to calculate the amount of child
support in the 2012 Administrative Order, in violation of HRS
§§ 576D-7(d) and 576E-15.  However, "[u]pon filing, the
[administrative] order shall have all the force and effect of a
final order or decree of the circuit court."  HRS § 576E-12(a)
(2006).  GW did not appeal from the 2012 Administrative Order. 
Thus, it was final and binding upon him.   See Hoopai v. Civil
Serv. Comm'n, 106 Hawai# i 205, 224, 103 P.3d 365, 384 (2004) ("A
judgment is final and binding unless an appeal is taken."). 
Accordingly, GW waived any claim that the child support
guidelines were improperly utilized or that his income while
incarcerated was not considered. 
For these reasons, we conclude that the Family Court
did not abuse its discretion in affirming the 2015 Administrative 
6NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Order.  The Family Court's March 28, 2017 Decision Affirming 2015
Administrative Order is affirmed.5
