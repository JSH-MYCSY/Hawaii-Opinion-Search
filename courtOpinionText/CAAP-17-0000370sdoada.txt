STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
MICHAEL E. MICHEL, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1DTC-16-061202)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Michael E. Michel (Michel) appeals
 
from a "Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and
 
Plea/Judgment," entered by the District Court of the First
 Circuit, Honolulu Division (district court),
1 on April 19, 2017. 
The district court convicted Michel of one count of excessive
 speeding, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 291C­
105(a)(1)(2) and (c)(1) (2007 & Supp. 2017).

 HRS § 291C-105 provides, in relevant part:
 
§291C-105 Excessive speeding.  (a) No person shall
drive a motor vehicle at a speed exceeding:
 
(1)	 The applicable state or county speed limit by
thirty miles per hour or more; or
 
(continued...)

On appeal, Michel contends: (1) the district court
 
abused its discretion in denying his motion to compel discovery;
 
(2) there was no substantial evidence to support his conviction because Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai' i (State) failed to lay 
the required foundation for admission of a laser speed reading and the applicable speed limit; and (3) the district court failed to administer the ultimate Tachibana colloquy. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve Michel's
 points of error as follows and reverse.

Michel argues, among other things, that the district 
court violated his right to testify by failing to provide him with an "ultimate" Tachibana colloquy, and the omission was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The State concedes these points. However, the State's concession "is not binding upon an appellate court[.]" State v. Hoang, 93 Hawai' i 333, 336, 3 P.3d 
499, 502 (2000) (quoting Territory v. Kogami, 37 Haw. 174, 175 (Haw. Terr. 1945)). "[A]ppellate courts have an independent duty 'first to ascertain that the confession of error is supported by the record and well-founded in law and second to determine that such error is properly preserved and prejudicial.'" State v. 
Veikoso, 102 Hawai' i 219, 221–22, 74 P.3d 575, 577–78 (2003) 
(quoting Hoang, 93 Hawai' i at 336, 3 P.3d at 502). 
The district court erred in failing to provide Michel 
with a colloquy on his right to testify in accordance with Tachibana v. State, 79 Hawai' i 226, 236, 236 n.7, 900 P.2d 1293, 
1303, 1303 n.7 (1995); see also State v. Pomroy, 132 Hawai' i 85, 
2(...continued)
(2)	 Eighty miles per hour or more irrespective of
the applicable state or county speed limit.
 
. . . .
 
(c)	 Any person who violates this section shall be
guilty of a petty misdemeanor. . . .

 We address Michel's arguments out of order for the sake of clarity.

92-93, 319 P.3d 1093, 1101-1102 (2014). Although the district 
court gave a pre-trial advisement to Michel on his right to testify and his right not to testify, the district court failed to engage in a Tachibana colloquy during trial before the defense rested its case. Because it is impossible to determine what effect the omission had on the outcome of the case, the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See Tachibana, 79 
Hawai'i at 240, 900 P.2d at 1307. 
Although the trial was defective due to the lack of an 
ultimate Tachibana colloquy, we must review Michel's contention on appeal that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction before remanding for a new trial. See State v. Davis, 
133 Hawai' i 102, 120, 324 P.3d 912, 930 (2014). Based on our 
review of the record in this case, and considering the applicable case law, the foundation was inadequate for admission of the laser speed reading because the State failed to demonstrate that Officer Russell Maeshiro (Officer Maeshiro) was trained in the 
operation of the LTI UltraLyte laser gun in accordance with the 
recommendations of the device's manufacturer, Laser Technologies Incorporated (LTI). See State v. Amiral, 132 Hawai' i 170, 319 
P.3d 1178 (2014); State v. Gonzalez, 128 Hawai' i 314, 327, 288 
P.3d 788, 801 (2012); State v. Assaye, 121 Hawai' i 204, 216, 216 
P.3d 1227, 1239 (2009). 
Officer Maeshiro testified he was initially trained to
 
use the LTI UltraLyte in 1998 at the police academy by Corporal
 Robert Steiner, and that he also had another class in 2013 "for
 an update." During Officer Maeshiro's training he used a
 trainer's manual and an operator's manual, which had the LTI logo
 and registered trademark. Officer Maeshiro further testified as
 follows:
 
[THE STATE]: And do you know or are you familiar with any
manufacturer's requirements regarding the training and
operating these types of devices?
 
[OFFICER MAESHIRO]: Uh, basically we passed the training
course on care and maintenance and operation and we take a
test at the end of the test -- uh, the class.
 
[THE STATE]: Okay. Is that training based on the manual?
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
[OFFICER MAESHIRO]: Yes, sir.
 
On cross-examination, Officer Maeshiro testified that he had no
 
personal knowledge as to whether someone from LTI wrote the 2013
 manual he had received with the LTI logo on it. Ultimately, in
 light of prevailing case law, the record indicates the State
 adduced insufficient evidence that the manuals Officer Maeshiro
 was given contained the training procedures approved by LTI or
 that the training Officer Maeshiro received was consistent with
 LTI's approved training requirements.
 
In 
Gonzalez, the operative facts were as follows:
 
Officer Franks testified that he was trained in the use of
 
the laser gun and that he had verified its accuracy on the
date in question. Officer Franks' training consisted of
"four hours of operator training in January of [2003] in the
police academy," and "further training as an instructor by
LTI representatives themselves as well as laser instructor
currently retired Sergeant Bobby Lung." As to accuracy,
Officer Franks explained that at his initial training in the
use of the laser gun in 2003, he was provided with a manual
"from [LTI]." That manual provides four separate tests
"that an operator must do prior to using the laser on the
shift." Officer Franks related that he performed all four
tests prior to using the laser gun on January 14, 2011.
 
On cross-examination, Officer Franks testified that although
the manual containing the four tests was not the manual that
was provided with the laser gun, it did contain both the HPD
seal and the LTI copyright. He further recounted that he
 received additional training directly from LTI personnel,
where the LTI personnel reviewed the HPD manual, and that
all the information covered by the LTI personnel was
replicated in the manual.
 
128 Hawai' i at 316, 288 P.3d at 790. 
The Hawai' i Supreme Court held the State failed to lay 
an adequate foundation to admit a laser gun speed reading,
 
because the State did not demonstrate that the citing officer's
 training met the manufacturer's requirements. The supreme court
 explained: 
The State introduced no evidence regarding the
manufacturer's requirements, and therefore, regardless of
the extent of Officer Franks' training, the court could not
have properly concluded that the manufacturer's requirements
were met.
 
To lay a sound foundation for the introduction of a reading
from a laser gun, 
Assaye requires the prosecution to
demonstrate that "the nature and extent of an officer's
 training in the operation of the laser gun meets the
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
requirements indicated by the manufacturer." Assaye, 121 
Hawai'i at 215, 216 P.3d at 1238. Logically, to meet this
burden the prosecution must establish both (1) the
requirements indicated by the manufacturer, and (2) thetraining actually received by the operator of the laser gun. 
Here, at trial the State only provided evidence of the
extent of Officer Franks' training. Although the State
explained that Officer Franks received four hours of
training in 2003, and further training in 2009 and 2010, the
record is silent as to what type of training is recommended
by the manufacturer. Without a showing as to the
manufacturer's recommendations, the court could not possibly
have determined whether the training received by Officer
Franks met "the requirements indicated by the manufacturer."

Id. at 327, 288 P.3d at 801 (emphasis added).
 
In Amiral, to establish the citing officer was trained
 
in accordance with the laser-gun manufacturer's recommendations,
 
the State adduced the following testimony:
 
Officer Ondayog indicated that in January 2002 he was
trained and certified in the use of the UltraLyte by HPD
Sergeant Ryan Nishibun at the police academy. On November
 4, 2010, Officer Ondayog attended a "refresher course" on
the use of the UltraLyte that was taught by HPD Officers[.]
 
Both the training at the police academy and the "refresher
course" consisted of a four-hour "lecture class" on the
 mechanics of the UltraLyte and four hours of "practice." . .
. [T]he course did not include a written or practical
examination.
 
Officer Ondayog testified that he received a manual as
a part of his training. 
He did not indicate whether the
 
manual that he had been given and used for comparison was a:
(1) "Marksman instructor manual"; (2) "Marksman (trainee)
manual"; (3) "LTI UltraLyte operator (user) manual"; or (4)
"LTI Marksman operator (user) manual."
 
The prosecutor asked Officer Ondayog if the instructions in
the manual specified how to test the UltraLyte to verify
that it was accurate and operating properly. . . . 
Over objection, Officer Ondayog testified that the
instructions in the manual specified the tests to ensure
that the UltraLyte is "working accurately and being operated
properly," and his training in the use of the UltraLyte was
based upon those instructions in the manual.
 
Officer Ondayog stated that he was trained to conduct the
following four tests in order to verify that the UltraLyte
is working properly: (1) the "self-test"; (2) the "display
test"; (3) the "scope alignment test"; and (4) the "delta
distance velocity test" (delta/distance test) or the
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"calibration test" (collectively "four tests")[.4]
 
. . . . 
On the date of the incident, Officer Ondayog performed the
four tests on his UltraLyte before his shift, "in accordance
with LTI's recommended procedures[.]" . . . Officer Ondayog
testified that based on the results of the four tests he
 determined that the UltraLyte was in "good working
condition." . . . 
Officer Ondayog indicated that he operated the UltraLyte in
accordance with his training and the manufacturer's
recommended procedures when he triggered the UltraLyte on
Amiral's vehicle. . . . 
On cross-examination, Officer Ondayog testified that he did
not have personal knowledge of (1) "any tests that can be
conducted on the [UltraLyte] that the manufacturer
recommends that ensures it's operating as intended[,]" (2)
"how those tests worked[,]" or (3) the "internal operation
of the [UltraLyte and] how it works." Officer Ondayog's
knowledge of the four tests was based on his reading of the
manual and his training.
 
132 Hawai' i at 172–74, 319 P.3d at 1180–82. 
The Hawai' i Supreme Court held the foundation for 
admitting a laser gun speed reading was insufficient for the
 
following reasons:
 
First, no evidence was presented showing that the manual
relied upon by Officer Ondayog to perform the four tests
actually set forth the manufacturer's recommended training
requirements.
 
Although Officer Ondayog testified that his training
conformed with the manufacturer's requirements because his
training conformed with the manual, the contents of the
manual as to those requirements were not established by the
State. Thus, it is not possible to determine whether the
manufacturer's recommendations were actually described in
the manual, so that conformance with the manual would be
equivalent to conformance with the manufacturer's
recommendations.
 
Second, assuming that the manufacturer's recommendations
were contained in the manual relied upon by Officer Ondayog,
his conclusory statement that the manual conformed to the
training he received did not describe the type of training
stated in the manual.
 
Third, there was no other evidence to demonstrate that an
officer learning to perform the four tests described by
Officer Ondayog satisfies the manufacturer's training
requirements. Consequently, the officer's description of
the four tests did not identify the type of training
 
4
 Officer Ondayog described the tests in detail. Id. at 173, 319 P.3d
 
at 1181.
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
recommended by the manufacturer.
 
Fourth, there is no indication in the record that the
instructors of the training courses Officer Ondayog attended
were actually certified by the manufacturer or had been
trained by the manufacturer. Additionally, there was no
evidence that the training course itself was approved by the
manufacturer or was consistent with the manufacturer's
 requirements. Such evidence together with the Officer's
learning to perform the four tests could have established
the type of training the manufacturer recommended.
 
Id. at 178-79, 319 P.3d at 1186-87 (footnotes omitted); see also 
Assaye, 121 Hawai' i at 210-216, 216 P.3d at 1233-39; State v. 
Ramos, No. CAAP-12-0000138, 2014 WL 2694230, at *3-6, (Hawai' i 
App. Jun 13, 2014) (Mem. Op.). 
Without the speed reading, there was insufficient 
evidence to support Michel's conviction for excessive speeding. See HRS § 291C-105(a)(1) and (2); State v. Manewa, 115 Hawai' i 
343, 357-358, 167 P.3d 336, 350-351 (2007). Further, there is no other evidence in the record to support a lesser offense of exceeding the speed limit under HRS § 291C-102(a)(1). Cf. State 
v. Fitzwater, 122 Hawai' i 354, 378, 227 P.3d 520, 544 (2010). 
In light of the above, we need not address Michel's 
remaining points of error. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Notice of
 
Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment," entered by the
 District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division, on April
 19, 2017, is reversed.
