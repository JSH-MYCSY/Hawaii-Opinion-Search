IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI #I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
DESMOND LEWI, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
(CR. NO. 08-1-483)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Desmond Lewi ( Lewi) appeals from
the March 1, 2017 Order Denying Defendant's Motion to Dismiss
Count 5 of the Complaint ( Order Denying Motion to Dismiss ), which
was entered against him and in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee the
State of Hawai #i (State), in the Circuit Court of the Third
Circuit ( Circuit Court).1
On October 5, 2008, Lewi shot and killed Cameron Mauga
in Hilo, Hawai #i, using a firearm that he possessed illegally. 
Lewi was charged with five counts:  (1) Murder in the Second
Degree ( Count 1); Carrying or Use of Firearm in the Commission of
a Separate Felony (Count 2 ); Carrying or Possessing a Loaded

Firearm on a Public Highway, in violation of Hawaii Revised
Statutes ( HRS) § 134-26(a) (2011)2 (Count 3 ); Place to Keep
Ammunition (Count 4 ); and Ownership or Possession Prohibited in
violation of HRS § 134-7(b) (2011)3 (Count 5).  On March 24,
2010, Lewi pled guilty to Manslaughter as a lesser included
offense in Count 1, and also pled guilty to Counts 3 and 5.  In
exchange for his plea, the State agreed to reduce Count 1 to
Manslaughter and moved to nolle prosequi  as to Counts 2 and 4,
which motion the Circuit Court granted.  On May 24, 2010, the
Circuit Court entered its Judgment of Conviction and Sentence
(Judgment), sentencing Lewi to, inter alia , twenty years of
incarceration for Count 1, to be served concurrently with ten
years of incarceration for Count 3; and a five-year sentence of
incarceration for Count 5, to be served consecutively.4 
2HRS § 134-26(a) provides in relevant part:
§ 134-26 Carrying or possessing a loaded firearm on a
public highway; penalty.   (a) It shall be unlawful for any
person on any public highway to carry on the person, or to
have in the person's possession, or to carry in a vehicle
any firearm loaded with ammunition . . . .
3HRS § 134-7(b) provides:
§ 134-7 Ownership or possession prohibited, when;
penalty.   
. . . .
(b) No person who is under indictment for, or has
waived indictment for, or has been bound over to the circuit
court for, or has been convicted in this State or elsewhere
of having committed a felony, or any crime of violence, or
an illegal sale of any drug shall own, possess, or control
any firearm or ammunition therefor.
4No direct appeal was taken.  On August 14, 2015, Lewi filed a
Petition to Vacate, Set Aside or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner
from Custody.  This petition was denied.  The denial of the petition was
affirmed by this court, but remains pending before the supreme court on a
petition for writ of certiorari.

On January 6, 2017, Lewi filed a motion to dismiss
(Motion to Dismiss), "pursuant to Rule 47 of the Hawai# i Rules of
Penal Procedure [(HRPP )]."  Lewi argued, inter alia , that Counts
3 and 5 merged under HRS § 701-109(1)(e) (2014)5 because he "had
but one general intent," rather than two separate intents.  In
the Motion to Dismiss, Lewi did not assert that his plea was not
entered voluntarily and intelligently.  The Circuit Court denied
the Motion to Dismiss on March 1, 2017.  On April 28, 2017,
pursuant to an extension of time, Lewi filed his notice of
appeal. 
On appeal, Lewi raises two points of error, contending
that:  (1) the Circuit Court's finding that Lewi implicitly
admitted to separate intents was clearly erroneous; and (2) that
the Circuit Court erred in denying his Motion to Dismiss. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve Lewi's points of error as follows:
5HRS § 701-109(1)(e) states:
§ 701-109 Method of prosecution when conduct
establishes an element of more than one offense.   (1) When
the same conduct of a defendant may establish an element of
more than one offense, the defendant may be prosecuted for
each offense of which such conduct is an element. The
defendant may not, however, be convicted of more than one
offense if: 
. . .  
(e) The offense is defined as a continuing course of
conduct and the defendant's course of conduct
was uninterrupted, unless the law provides that
specific periods of conduct constitute separate
offenses. 
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
As a threshold issue, we must consider whether Lewi's
guilty plea precludes Lewi's post-judgment argument that Counts 3
and 5 merge, as argued in the Motion to Dismiss.  
In State v. Morin, 71 Haw. 159, 162, 785 P.2d 1316,
1318 (1990), the Hawai# i Supreme Court made clear that "a guilty
plea made voluntarily and intelligently precludes a defendant
from later asserting any nonjurisdictional claims, including
constitutional challenges to the pretrial proceedings."  In
Morin, the defendants pled no contest to drug-related charges in
exchange for either a reduction of charges or a dismissal of
other charges.  Id.  After the judgments were entered, the
defendants appealed, contesting the court's denial of their
motion to suppress evidence.  Id.  The supreme court dismissed
the appeal, stating:
To allow the Defendants to plead no contest in
exchange for the reduction and dismissal of charges against
them, and then to permit them to attack the remaining
convictions achieved by those pleas, where those pleas were
not conditioned upon the right to appeal, would jeopardize
the integrity of the plea bargaining process.  Defendants'
pleas, therefore, preclude them from now contesting any
nonjurisdictional issues and the convictions resulting from
those pleas.
. . . . 
By entering pleas of no contest without reserving the
right to appeal the denial of their Motion to Suppress,
Defendants effectively waived their right to appeal that
ruling. We find, therefore, that their appeal is not
properly before this court.  Accordingly, the appeal is
hereby dismissed.
Id. at 163, 785 P.2d at 1319.6  
6The supreme court recognized that, under certain circumstances not
present in Morin, a plea might be conditioned on an appeal of certain reserved
issues.  Morin, 71 Haw. at 163, 785 P.2d at 1319.  There was no reservation of
a right to appeal in this case.
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
We note that Hawai# i appellate courts have applied
Morin to HRPP Rule 40 petitions, as well as to direct appeals. 
See, e.g., Schwartz v. State , 136 Hawai #i 258, 281, 361 P.3d
1161, 1184 (2015); State v. Domingo , 82 Hawai #i 265, 921 P.2d
1166 (1996); State v. Hernandez , CAAP-15-0000067, 2017 WL 1034487
(App. March 17, 2017) (SDO); Crabbe v. State, CAAP–14–0000817,
2015 WL 3936916 (App. June 25, 2015) (SDO).
Here, like in Morin, Lewi benefitted from the plea deal
in that two charges were dismissed and his murder charge was
reduced to manslaughter.  To allow Lewi now to attack one of the
remaining charges on non-jurisdictional grounds would jeopardize
the integrity of the plea bargaining process.  See Morin, 71 Haw.
at 163, 785 P.2d at 1319.  Lewi does not contend, and we find no
basis for concluding, that an assertion of merger is
jurisdictional.  For these reasons, we conclude that the Circuit
Court did not err in denying Lewi's Motion to Dismiss.
Accordingly, the Circuit Court's March 1, 2017 Order
Denying Motion to Dismiss is affirmed.
