IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
LEON R. ROUSE, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
ANDREW R. WALDEN, Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 15-1-0995)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, and Reifurth and Chan, JJ.)
 
This appeal arises from a suit for defamation initiated 
by Plaintiff-Appellant Leon R. Rouse against Defendant-Appellee 
Andrew R. Walden concerning Walden's statements referring to Rouse as a "[c]onvicted child molester" in a November 8, 2013 update of a Hawai' i Free Press article ("Article"). Rouse, pro 
se, appeals from the Final Judgment entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit ("Circuit Court")
1 on April 11, 2017, which 
states that it is based upon the Order Granting Defendant Andrew R. Walden's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Defamation and
 False-Light Invasion of Privacy Claims in Plaintiff's Second
 Amended Complaint Filed December 18, 2015 ("Order Granting MPSJ")
 entered by the Circuit Court on February 10, 2017.

On appeal, Rouse contends that the Circuit Court erred
 
in entering the Order Granting MPSJ and Final Judgment because
 
1/
 The Honorable Edwin C. Nacino presided.

 Rouse's appeal from the Final Judgment entitles him to appellate
review of all interlocutory orders in the case, including the Order Granting
MPSJ, regardless of whether he referred to them in his notice of appeal.

(1) genuine issues of material fact exist as to the veracity of
 
the statement that Rouse is a "convicted child molester" and (2)
 it did not review the evidence in the light most favorable to
 Rouse, the non-moving party.
3 Rouse concedes that he was
 
convicted in January 1998 of violating the Child Abuse Law in the
 Philippines after he was discovered with an unrelated minor naked
 in his hotel room, that his conviction was affirmed by the
 Philippines Court of Appeal and subsequently by the Philippines
 Supreme Court, and that he served eight years in New Bilibid
 Prison in Muntinlupa City upon his conviction. Rouse argues,
 however, that because a July 2005 report issued by the United
 Nations Human Rights Committee under the optional protocol to the
 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ("ICCPR"),
 entitled "Views under article 5, paragraph 4, of the Optional
 Protocol," ("U.N. Committee Report") concerning Rouse's
 conviction in the Philippines courts concluded that "the facts
 before it disclose a violation of articles 14, paragraphs 1 and
 3(c) and (e); 9, paragraph 1; and 7 of the [ICCPR]," there were
 genuine issues of material fact as to whether Rouse was a
 "convicted child molester."
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 address Rouse's points of error as follows and affirm:
 
(1) We review the Circuit Court's grant of Walden's 
MPSJ de novo. Querubin v. Thronas, 107 Hawai' i 48, 56, 109 P.3d 
689, 697 (2005) (quoting Durette v. Aloha Plastic Recycling, Inc., 105 Hawai' i 490, 501, 100 P.3d 60, 71 (2004)). The moving 
party, who "bears the ultimate burden of persuasion" throughout summary judgment proceedings, also carries the initial burden of production. Stanford Carr Dev. Corp. v. Unity House Inc., 111 
Hawai'i 286, 295–96, 141 P.3d 459, 468–69 (2006) (quoting French 
v. Haw. Pizza Hut, Inc., 105 Hawai' i 462, 470, 99 P.3d 1046, 1054 
3/
 In both his memorandum in opposition to the motion for partial
summary judgment and again at the hearing on the motion, Rouse explained that
he was not raising a "false light" claim against Walden, despite the
allegations in paragraph 8 of the second amended complaint. Therefore, we
understand Rouse to allege a single cause of action for defamation.

(2004)). "Once the movant has satisfied the initial burden of
 
showing that there is no genuine issue of material fact, the
 opposing party must come forward, through affidavit or other
 evidence, with specific facts showing that there is a genuine
 issue of material fact." Miller v. Manuel, 9 Haw. App. 56, 65,
 
828 P.2d 286, 292 (1991) (citing K.M. Young & Assoc., Inc. v.
 Cieslik, 4 Haw. App. 657, 675 P.2d 793 (1983)).  If the non-
moving party fails to meet its responsive burden, the moving
 party is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. Id. at
 
66, 828 P.2d at 292 (citations omitted); Haw. R. Civ. P. 56(e).
 
In order to sustain a claim for defamation, a plaintiff 
must establish the following four elements: (1) "a false and defamatory statement concerning another;" (2) "an unprivileged publication to a third party;" (3) "fault amounting at least to negligence on the part of the publisher [actual malice where the plaintiff is a public figure];" and (4) "either actionability of the statement irrespective of special harm or the existence of special harm caused by the publication." Nakamoto v. Kawauchi, 
___ Hawai' i ___, ___, ___ P.3d ___, ___ (2018), No. SCWC-13­
0004947, 2018 WL 2111228, at *10 (Haw. May 8, 2018) (quoting Beamer v. Nishiki, 66 Haw. 572, 578–79, 670 P.2d 1264, 1271 (1983)). "[T]ruth is an absolute defense to defamation claims." Id. at ___, ___ P.3d at ___, 2018 WL 2111228 at *14 (citing Kohn v. W. Hawai' i Today, Inc., 65 Haw. 584, 590, 656 P.2d 79, 84 
(1982)). "'[S]ubstantial truth[, however,] is a matter for the jury to decide." Id. (citing Kohn, 65 Haw. at 590, 656 P.2d at 
84. 
In the MPSJ, Walden provided the Circuit Court with a
 
certified copy of the Decision of the Philippine Court of Appeals
 in case CA-G.R. CR No. 21714, dated August 18, 1999 ("Appellate
 Court Decision") to support the truthfulness of his statements
 regarding Rouse's conviction in the Philippines. The Appellate
 Court Decision included an excerpt of the January 12, 1998
 decision by the Regional Trial Court of Laoag City ("Trial Court
 Decision") that declared Rouse guilty beyond reasonable doubt in
 violation of Article III, Section 5, paragraph "b" of R.A. No.
 7610, otherwise known as the Child Abuse Act. "[Rouse was]
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
sentenced to serve an indeterminate penalty of TEN (10) YEARS,
 
TWO (2) MONTHS AND TWENTY-ONE (21) DAYS of prison mayor, as
 minimum, to SEVENTEEN (17) YEARS, FOUR (4) MONTHS AND ONE (1) DAY
 of reclusion temporal as the maximum thereof." The Appellate
 Court Decision affirmed the Trial Court Decision, affirmatively
 answering the principal question of "whether or not the
 prosecution had established the guilt of [Rouse] beyond a
 reasonable doubt."
 
Opposing the motion, Rouse urged the Circuit Court to
 
deny the MPSJ on the basis that the U.N. Committee Report created
 a genuine issue of material fact as to the allegedly defamatory
 statements in the Article because the ICCPR "grants the authority
 to the United Nations Human Rights Committee to review for
 veracity and conformity to the [ICCPR] any legal proceeding of a
 member country, upon appeal." In addition to referencing the
 U.N. Committee Report which was attached as an exhibit to his complaint, Rouse attached the following documents to his opposition: (1) seven of the twenty-one pages of a United States Department of State Philippines Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 1998; (2) a copy of an opinion piece authored by Rouse for The Maui News newspaper entitled "Fontaine has to learn facts before passing judgment"; (3) a December 12, 2010 Hawai' i 
Free Press article entitled "Hawaii Legislators' favorite child molester claims he is the victim"; (4) an August 9, 2005 article by B.J. Reyes of the Honolulu Star Bulletin entitled "Man had an unfair trial, U.N. rules"; and (5) an August 7, 2005 article by Derrick DePledge of the Honolulu Advertiser entitled "Ex-House aide gets favorable ruling". 
At the hearing on the MPSJ, Rouse acknowledged that he
 
does not dispute the Philippine government's ability to prosecute
 and convict him:
 
MR. ROUSE: . . . I do not oppose the fact that the
Philippine Government has a right to do whatever they decide
in the Philippines, okay.
 
. . . .
 
THE COURT: You're not opposing what [Walden] reported
in terms of what occurred in the Philippines, correct? I
 
mean that's –­
MR. ROUSE: Correct.
 
4
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
THE COURT: –- that's what he reported accurately
because that's part of the records and files in the country
of the Philippines.
 
MR. ROUSE: Correct.
 
Rouse argued, however, that the U.N. Committee Report refuted his
 
conviction and presented a genuine issue of material fact as to
 the veracity of Walden's statements in the Article. Similarly,
 Rouse asserts in this appeal that "the [Circuit] Court was
 presented with contradictory reports from two different sources,
 the Philippine Court of Appeals and the U.N. Committee" and that
 the U.N. Committee Report "establishes genuine issues of opposing
 material facts which require adjudication by a jury."
 
Although the question is one of first impression in
 
Hawai'i, other state and federal courts have declined to 
recognize ICCPR decisions as binding or as mandating any remedy. 
"The United States is not obligated to provide relief for alleged
 violations of the ICCPR committed by other nations." U.S. v.
 
Duarte-Acero, 296 F.3d 1277, 1283 (11th Cir. 2002). 
Furthermore, the ICCPR does not create judicially-
enforceable individual rights . Treaties affect United
 
States law only if they are self-executing or otherwise
given effect by congressional legislation. Whitney v.
Robertson , 124 U.S. 190[, 194] (1888);  United States v.
 
Postal, 589 F.2d 862, 875 (5th Cir. 1979). Articles 1
 
through 27 of the ICCPR are not self-executing. [ U.S. v.]
Duarte-Acero , 208 F.3d [1282, ]1284 n.8; 138 Cong. Rec.
S4783-84 (daily ed. Apr. 2, 1992) ("[T]he United States
declares that the provisions of Articles 1 through 27 of the
ICCPR are not self-executing."). Nor has Congress passed
implementing legislation. [ U.S. ex rel. ]Perez[ v. Warden ,
FMC Rochester ], 286 F.3d [1059, ]1063[ (8th Cir. 2002)];
Buell[ v. Mitchell ], 274 F.3d [337, ]372 [(6th Cir. 2001)].
Therefore,  the ICCPR is not binding on federal courts .
 
Duarte-Acero, 296 F.3d at 1283 (emphasis added, some citations
 
omitted). 
Following Duarte-Acero, state courts have refused to
 
hold that alleged violations of the ICCPR mandate remedies in
 United States courts. See, e.g., Baird v. State, 831 N.E.2d 109,
 
115 (Ind. 2005) (holding that defendant sentenced to death could
 not show a reasonable probability of success on the merits of his
 international law claim because the ICCPR did not create
 obligations enforceable in United States courts); Simmons v.
 Commonwealth, 191 S.W.3d 557, 567 (Ky. 2006) (holding that death
 
5
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
sentence did not violate Article 6 of the ICCPR because the ICCPR
 
is not binding on courts in the United States and does not
 require States-Parties to abolish the death penalty);
 Commonwealth v. Judge, 916 A.2d 511, 526-27 (Pa. 2007) (holding
 that neither the decisions of the Human Rights Committee, nor the
 ICCPR, mandated that the court consider the merits of defendant's
 claim that Canada violated Article 6 of the ICCPR by deporting
 him to a death sentence in the United States because the ICCPR is
 not a self-executing treaty and Congress has not passed
 implementing legislation). Thus, the U.N. Committee Report's
 finding of the Philippines' violations of the ICCPR, although
 reflecting a third party's view on the legitimacy of Rouse's
 conviction under international law, does not raise an issue of
 "substantial truth" because it does not overturn or otherwise
 alter the fact of Rouse's conviction in the Philippines. 
Furthermore, since Rouse does not contest the reasonableness of
 equating a conviction under the Child Abuse Law and having been
 convicted of child molestation, and because the ICCPR does not
 create judicially-enforceable rights, Duarte-Acero, 296 F.3d at
 1283, the Circuit Court correctly concluded that the U.N.
 Committee Report did not affect the fact of Rouse's conviction.
 
The Circuit Court, therefore, appropriately entered the 
Order Granting MPSJ and Final Judgment on the basis that Walden's statements in the Article were true because Walden provided a certified copy of the Appellate Court Decision affirming Rouse's conviction and the U.N. Committee Report has no effect on the conviction. See Lucas v. Citizens Communications Co., No. 05­
17423, 2007 WL 1853302, at *3 (9th Cir. 2007) (holding that summary judgment in favor of defendant was proper where plaintiff "himself admitted that he charged people more than the set maximum price, and truth is an absolute defense to defamation." (citing Gonsalves v. Nissan Motor Corp. in Haw., 100 Hawai' i 149, 
173, 58 P.3d 1196, 1220 (2002)) (internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted)). Further, Rouse himself did not dispute the Philippine government's authority to prosecute and sustain his conviction in the Philippines. Accordingly, Rouse's first point of error is without merit.

(2) We construe Rouse's second point of error to assert
 
that the Circuit Court erred in entering the Order Granting MPSJ
 
and Final Judgment because it failed to consider the evidence in
 the light most favorable to Rouse when it "resolved the
 disagreements between the Philippine Court of Appeals and the
 U.N. Committee in [Walden's] favor." In adjudicating a motion for summary judgment, "[t]he evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. In other words, [this court] must view all of the evidence and the inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion." Querubin, 107 Hawai' i at 56, 109 P.3d at 697 (quotation 
marks and citation omitted). 
There is no disagreement between the Philippine Court
 
of Appeals and the U.N. Committee as to the central issue of this
 case, which is whether Rouse was convicted of violating the Child
 Abuse Law. The record is devoid of any indication that the
 Circuit Court failed to view the evidence related to the fact of
 Rouse's conviction in a light most favorable to Rouse because
 there is no evidence subject to conflicting inferences. Even if
 we were to conclude that the U.N. Committee report warranted the
 inference that Rouse's conviction was illegitimate under
 international law, it would not change the fact that Rouse was
 convicted and that his conviction has not been reversed or
 vacated. Accordingly, Rouse's second point of error is without
 merit.
 
Therefore, the February 10, 2017 Order Granting MPSJ
 
and the April 11, 2017 Final Judgment are affirmed.
