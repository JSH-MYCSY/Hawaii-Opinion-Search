NO. CAAP-17-0000376
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
ALFRED N. SPINNEY, Defendant-Appellant,
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 3PC11100332K)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Reifurth and Chan, JJ.)
 
Upon review of Defendant-Appellant Alfred N. Spinney's
 
(Spinney) appeal in appellate court case number CAAP-17-0000376,
 
it appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction over Spinney's
 appeal from three interlocutory orders that the Honorable Melvin
 Fujino entered on April 4, 2017, April 10, 2017, and April 26,
 2017, in Circuit Court Criminal No. 3PC11100332K, because all
 three orders are interlocutory orders that are not eligible for
 appellate review under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-11
 (2016) in the absence of either an appealable final judgment of
 conviction or final order of dismissal.
 
"The right of appeal in a criminal case is purely 
statutory[.]" State v. Nicol
, 140 Hawai' i 482, 485, 403 P.3d 
259, 262 (2017) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The law that allows appeals from circuit court criminal cases is HRS ยง 641-11, which provides that "[a]ny party aggrieved by the NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
judgment of a circuit court in a criminal matter may appeal to 
the intermediate appellate court, subject to chapter 602, in the manner and within the time provided by the rules of court. The sentence of the court in a criminal case shall be the judgment." Thus, "[u]nder HRS ยง 641-11, the sentence of the court in a criminal case is the judgment from which an appeal is authorized[,]" and where "[t]here [is] no conviction and sentence in . . . [a] case, there can be no appeal under HRS ยง 641-11[.]" State v. Kealaiki, 95 Hawai' i 309, 312, 22 P.3d 588, 591 (2001) 
(internal quotation marks and citations omitted); State v. Ferreira, 54 Haw. 485, 486-87, 510 P.2d 88, 89 (1973) (Dismissing an appeal from a "judgment of conviction [that] does not include any sentence imposed upon the defendant[.]"). 
In the instant case, Spinney's appeal is premature, and
 
we lack appellate jurisdiction.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED appellate court case
 
number CAAP-17-0000376 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
