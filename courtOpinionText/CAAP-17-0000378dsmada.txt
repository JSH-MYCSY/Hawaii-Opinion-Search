IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI #I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
PHILIP BIKLE, Defendant-Appellant.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
(CASE NO. 3DTI-16-016896)
ORDER GRANTING NOVEMBER 17, 2017 MOTION TO DISMISS
APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
Upon review of (1) Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawaii's
(State) November 17, 2017 motion to dismiss Defendant-Appellant
Michael Bikle's (Bikle), pro se appeal, (2) the lack of any
response by Bikle to the State's motion, and (3) the record, it
appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction under Hawaii Revised
Statues (HRS) § 641-1(a) (2016).
Bikle appeals from the Honorable Michael J. Udovic's
March 30, 2017 order denying Bikle's motion to suppress evidence
regarding the State's citation for the following four traffic
violations in district court case number 3DTI-16-016896:
(1) no license plate on a motor vehicle in violation
of HRS § 249-7 (2001 & Supp. 2016);
(2) delinquent vehicle tax in violation of HRS § 249-2 
(Supp. 2016);
(3) operating a vehicle without a certificate of
inspection in violation of HRS § 286-25 (2007);
andNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(4) operating a vehicle without a certificate of
registration in violation of HRS § 286-47 (2007).
Each violation is punishable by only a fine, and, thus,
constitutes a "'[t]raffic infraction' . . . for which the
prescribed penalties do not include imprisonment[.]"  HRS 
§ 291D-2 (2007).  "No traffic infraction shall be classified as a
criminal offense."  HRS § 291D-3(a) (2007).
Under HRS Chapter 291D, a district court adjudicates a
contested traffic citation pursuant to HRS § 291D-8 (2007)
without holding a standard trial, but, if the district court
adjudicates the citation in favor of the State, then "[t]he
defendant may request a trial pursuant to the Hawaii rules of
evidence and the rules of the district court[.]"  HRS 
§ 291D-13(a) (2007).  After the district court enters the
resulting judgment on the trial pursuant to HRS § 291D-13,
Rule 19(d) of the Hawai# i Civil Traffic Rules provides that
"[a]ppeals from judgments entered after a trial may be taken in
the manner provided for appeals from district court civil
judgments."  HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals from district
court civil judgments as follows:
Pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a) (1993), appeals are allowed in
civil matters from all final judgments, orders, or decrees
of circuit and district courts.  In district court cases, a
judgment includes any order from which an appeal lies.  A
final order means an order ending the proceeding, leaving
nothing further to be accomplished.  When a written
judgment, order, or decree ends the litigation by fully
deciding all rights and liabilities of all parties, leaving
nothing further to be adjudicated, the judgment, order, or
decree is final and appealable.
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai# i 425, 426, 984 P.2d 1251,
1252 (1999) (citations, internal quotation marks, and footnote
omitted).
The district court has not yet held a trial pursuant to
HRS § 291D-13, much less entered a final judgment, in the
underlying case.  Therefore, the March 30, 2017 order is an
interlocutory order that is not eligible for appellate review
until entry of an appealable final judgment.  See State v. Adam,
97 Hawai# i 475, 482, 40 P.3d 877, 884 (2002) ("As a general rule,
an appeal from a final judgment in a case brings up for review
-2-NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
all preceding interlocutory orders in the case.") (Citations
omitted).  Bikle's appeal is premature, and we lack jurisdiction
to review the March 30, 2017 order.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the State's
November 17, 2017 motion to dismiss Bikle's appeal is granted,
and the appeal is dismissed.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, February 1, 2018.
