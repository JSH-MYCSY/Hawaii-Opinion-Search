IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI #I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
PHILIP BIKLE, Defendant-Appellant.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
(CASE NO. 3DTI-16-016896)
ORDER DENYING FEBRUARY 9, 2018 HRAP RULE 40 MOTION
FOR RECONSIDERATION OF FEBRUARY 1, 2018 ORDER OF DISMISSAL
AND
ORDER OF CORRECTION OF FEBRUARY 1, 2018 ORDER
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
Upon review of (1) the February 1, 2018 order granting
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawaii's (State) November 17, 2017
motion to dismiss Defendant-Appellant Philip Bikle's (Bikle), pro
se, appeal, (2) Bikle's February 9, 2018 motion for
reconsideration of the February 1, 2018 order of dismissal,
pursuant to Rule 40 of the Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure
(HRAP), and (3) the record, it appears that we did not overlook
or misapprehend any points of law or fact when we entered the
February 1, 2018 order of dismissal.  Bikle's reliance on State
v. Baranco, 77 Hawai #i 351, 884 P.2d 729 (1994) is misplaced
because his appeal does not involve an order denying a motion to
dismiss on double jeopardy grounds, as in Baranco .  Further, his
claim that we have jurisdiction under Hawaii Revised Statutes NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
ยง 641-1(b) is incorrect, because only circuit courts (not
district courts) may allow an interlocutory appeal under that
statute.
We note however, that the February 1, 2018 order of
dismissal contains a clerical error in that it refers to Bikle as
Michael Bikle rather than Philip Bikle.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Bikle's
February 9, 2018 HRAP Rule 40 motion for reconsideration of the
February 1, 2018 order of dismissal is denied.
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that the February 1, 2018
order of dismissal is corrected to reflect that all references to
Bikle refer to Defendant-Appellant Philip Bikle, and not Michael
Bikle.    
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, February 14, 2018.
