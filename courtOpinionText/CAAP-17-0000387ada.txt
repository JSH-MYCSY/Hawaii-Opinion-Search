OPINION OF THE COURT BY CHAN, J.  
In this appeal arising out of a foreclosure action, 
Plaintiffs-Appellants Ray A. Delapinia and Robyn M. Delapinia 
(the Delapinias) appeal from the Final Judgment entered by the  
      FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (circuit court),1 on 
April 18, 2017, against the Delapinias and in favor of 
Defendants-Appellees Nationstar Mortgage LLC (Nationstar), 
Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), Terry Louise 
Cole (Cole), Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. 
(MERS), and American Savings Bank, F.S.B. (ASB). The Delapinias 
also challenge the following orders upon which the Final Judgment 
was based: (1) the January 9, 2017 order granting Nationstar and 
Fannie Mae's motion for judgment on the pleadings or in the 
alternative for summary judgment (Order Granting Nationstar and 
Fannie Mae's MJP); (2)
 the January 18, 2017 order granting with 
prejudice Cole's motion to dismiss the Delapinias' First Amended Complaint and ASB's substantive joinder thereto (Order Granting 
Cole and ASB's MTD); and (3) the March 21, 2017 order granting 
MERS' motion to dismiss the Delapinias' First Amended Complaint 
(Order Granting MERS' MTD). 
As explained below, we conclude that the circuit court 
erred in dismissing the Delapinias' claims against Nationstar, 
Fannie Mae, Cole, and ASB, but did not err in dismissing the 
claim against MERS. As to Nationstar and Fannie Mae, we conclude 
that the Delapinias' wrongful foreclosure claim based on 
deprivation of ownership was subject to, and properly brought 
within, the six-year statute of limitations under Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS) § 657-1(4) (2016) and the circuit court therefore 
erred in concluding that the claim was time-barred. As to MERS, 
we conclude that dismissal was proper where the Delapinias failed 
to allege that they have tendered or are able to tender the 
amount of their indebtedness to Nationstar under the mortgage, 
pursuant to the tender rule. 
As to Cole and ASB, we conclude 
that the Delapinias pleaded sufficient factual allegations for their quiet title and ejectment claims to survive dismissal under 
the notice pleading standard. Accordingly, this case must be

remanded for further proceedings. 
I. BACKGROUND 
A. Factual Background2 
In November 2007, the Delapinias purchased real 
property on the island of Maui (the Property). The Delapinias 
executed a note and mortgage (Mortgage) in favor of GMAC Mortgage 
USA Corporation (GMAC), through its nominee MERS, in connection 
with the purchase of the Property. The Mortgage granted the 
mortgagee a power of sale in the event the Delapinias defaulted 
on their loan. 
In March 2010, the Mortgage was assigned to Nationstar. 
Shortly after, Nationstar executed a "Notice of Mortgagee's 
Intention to Foreclose Under Power of Sale" (Notice of Sale), 
recorded on March 30, 2010, due to the Delapinias' continued 
default on the mortgage loan. Under the Notice of Sale, the 
foreclosure sale was originally scheduled for April 23, 2010. 
Nationstar published the Notice of Sale in The Maui News on 
March 26, April 2, and April 9, 2010. 
The foreclosure sale was postponed until August 6, 
2010, at which time the Property was sold to Nationstar or its 
designee as the highest bidder. The postponed date was never 
published. 
On August 27, 2010, Nationstar recorded a "Mortgagee's 
Affidavit of Foreclosure Sale Under Power of Sale" (Foreclosure 
Affidavit) pertaining to the foreclosure sale. The Foreclosure 
Affidavit was signed by an attorney who was not licensed in 
Hawai# i. 
Nationstar conveyed the Property to Fannie Mae by deed 
recorded on February 16, 2011. Fannie Mae then sold and conveyed 
2 This factual background is taken primarily from the allegations in
the Delapinias' complaint, which we take as true for purposes of this appeal.

c

limited to the allegations of the complaint, and we must deem those allegationsto be true." (Original brackets, ellipsis and citation omitted)).

the Property to Cole by limited warranty deed recorded on 
December 10, 2012. 
Cole granted a first mortgage on the Property to MERS3 
as nominee of Pinnacle Capital Mortgage Corporation, recorded on 
December 10, 2012, and a second mortgage to ASB, recorded on 
September 2, 2015. 
B. Procedural Background 
On August 5, 2016, the Delapinias filed a Complaint 
alleging wrongful foreclosure. On October 20, 2016,4 the 
Delapinias filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC), asserting two 
counts: (1) quiet title, ejectment, and declaratory relief 
against all Defendants-Appellees; and (2)
 wrongful foreclosure 
against Nationstar and Fannie Mae. 
On November 7, 2016, Nationstar and Fannie Mae filed an 
answer to the FAC. On the same day, Cole filed a motion to dismiss the FAC. On November 14, 2016, ASB filed a substantive 
joinder to Cole's motion to dismiss the FAC.
5 
On November 22, 2016, Nationstar and Fannie Mae filed a 
motion for judgment on the pleadings or in the alternative for 
summary judgment (Nationstar and Fannie Mae's MJP). 
On November 23, 2016, MERS filed a motion to dismiss 
the FAC (MERS' MTD). 
On December 15, 2016, the circuit court held a hearing 
on Nationstar and Fannie Mae's MJP and Cole and ASB's MTD, at 
which it orally granted both motions. The circuit court stated: 
3 MERS is a defendant in this matter in its capacity as a mortgagee of
Cole, not of the Delapinias. 
4 Many of the filings in this case were filed ex officio in the
Circuit Court of the First Circuit. Where the file-stamped date of any
document differs from its ex officio filing date, we refer to the ex officiofiling date. Cochrane v. Azman, No. 29562, 2011 WL 661714, at *1 n.3 (Haw.
App. Feb. 22, 2011) (mem. op.) (citations omitted) ("The ex officio filingdate of any document prevails over the file-stamped date to the extent thatthe dates differ from each other."). 
5 Cole's motion to dismiss and ASB's substantive joinder thereto are
collectively referred to herein as "Cole and ASB's MTD."

Even when accepting Plaintiffs' factual allegations as
true, dismissal of the claims against Terry Cole, American
Savings Bank and Nationstar is appropriate.[] 6
The wrongful foreclosure tort claim accrued, at the
latest, at the time of the auction on August 6, 2010 becausethe plaintiff knew or should have known the purported wrongoccurred at that particular time.
The complaint was filed August 5th, 2016, nearly six
years after the alleged improper foreclosure sale.Plaintiff cites authority applying the six-year statute oflimitations to the tort-contracts hybrids. However, as pledand argued, the claim sounds solely in tort. Therefore,Plaintiffs' wrongful foreclosure claim is barred by the two-year statute of limitations under HRS 657-7.
As to the sale being void or voidable, any reading of
the law in Hawaii is improperly completed nonjudicialforeclosure sales are voidable -- my reading of the law,excuse me, is that nonjudicial foreclosure sales arevoidable if the claim is timely and the current owners arenot bona fide purchasers.
There's no allegation that Defendants did not pay
value for the property, and there is no allegation that thecurrent owners had actual notice of Plaintiffs' claims. 
There is no allegation that Plaintiffs or anyone else
recorded any kind of documentation reasonably indicatingPlaintiffs had any interest in the subject party (sic).Therefore, the argument for the non-bona fide purchaserstatus under constructive or inquiry notice fails as well.So I'm going to go ahead and grant both motions. 
On January 9, 2017, the circuit court filed its Order
Granting Nationstar and Fannie Mae's MJP.  
On January 10, 2017, the circuit court held a hearing 
on MERS' MTD, at which it orally granted the motion. The circuit
court stated:  
Even when accepting Plaintiffs' factual allegations as true,
dismissal of the claims against MERS is appropriate.
As to the sale being void or voidable, the Court's
reading of the law in Hawaii is improperly completednonjudicial foreclosure sales are voidable if the claim istimely and the current owners are not bona fide purchasers.
There's no allegation that Cole didn't acquire the
property for value and no allegation that she had notice ofany of Plaintiffs' outstanding claims, if any. So Cole is abona fide purchaser. 
The Court has already dismissed claims against the
current owners consequent to their innocent bona fidepurchaser status. As the mortgagee, MERS receives the sameprotection. 
6 Although  the  circuit  court  did  not  expressly  mention  Fannie  Mae,  we
presume  that  the  circuit  court's  mention  of  the  dismissal  of  the  claims  against
Nationstar  also  included  dismissal  of  the  claims  against  Fannie  Mae,  as
Nationstar  and  Fannie  Mae  filed  a  joint  motion  for  judgment  on  the  pleadings.
This  is  also  evidenced  by  the  circuit  court's  written  Order  Granting  Nationstar
and  Fannie  Mae's  MJP. 
5 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Further, Plaintiff fails to state a quiet title claim
and they don't allege that they have paid or are able to
tender the amount of indebtedness that would be due under the mortgage.
The notice of sale complied with the mortgage. The 
notice of sale properly described the property under HRS667-7(a)(1). The notice of sale publishing has compliedwith HRS 667-7. A Hawaii attorney is not required to signthe notice of sale or affidavit of foreclosure. 
And lastly, written publication of an auction
postponement is not necessary.
The Court's going to go ahead and grant the motion.
The matter is dismissed with prejudice. 
On January 18, 2017, the circuit court filed its Order 
Granting Cole and ASB's MTD. On March 21, 2017, the circuit 
court filed its Order Granting MERS' MTD. 
The circuit court entered its Final Judgment on 
April 18, 2017, pursuant to the Order Granting Nationstar and 
Fannie Mae's MJP, the Order Granting Cole and ASB's MTD, and the 
Order Granting MERS' MTD. The Delapinias timely appealed. 
II. POINTS OF ERROR 
On appeal, the Delapinias argue that the circuit court 
erred in granting Nationstar & Fannie Mae's MJP, Cole & ASB's 
MTD, and MERS' MTD. Specifically, the Delapinias argue that the 
circuit court erred in making the following conclusions: (1) the 
wrongful foreclosure claim was time-barred because the statute of 
limitations for a wrongful foreclosure claim is two years and 
commences on the date of the foreclosure sale; 
(2) the 
Delapinias' allegation that Cole was not a bona fide purchaser failed; (3) MERS, as Cole's mortgagee, receives the same 
protection as a bona fide purchaser; (4) the Delapinias failed to 
state a quiet title claim because "they don't allege that they 
have paid or are able to tender the amount of indebtedness that 
would be due under the mortgage"; and (5) the Notice of Sale 
complied with the Mortgage and HRS Chapter 667, Part I (1993 & 
Supp. 2010).

"strictly limited to the allegations of the complaint," which we view in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and deem to be 
true. Id. at 280-81, 81 P.3d at 1195-96 (quoting Blair, 95 
Hawai# i at 252, 21 P.3d at 457). "However, in weighing the

IV. DISCUSSION 
A. Wrongful Foreclosure Claim Against Nationstar and Fannie Mae
1. The Delapinias' wrongful foreclosure claim was subjectto the six-year statute of limitations under HRS § 657-1(4). 
The Delapinias assert that the circuit court erred in 
granting Nationstar and Fannie Mae's MJP because it erroneously 
concluded that the statute of limitations on their claim for 
wrongful foreclosure was two years and commenced on the date of 
7       
    
            
             FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the foreclosure sale. 
The Delapinias argue that their claim for wrongful 
foreclosure against Nationstar and Fannie Mae is subject to at 
least a six-year statute of limitations under the catch-all 
statute, HRS § 657-1(4).7 Instead, the circuit court applied the 
two-year statute of limitations under HRS § 657-7 (2016),8 
because, "as pled and argued, the [wrongful foreclosure] claim 
sounds solely in tort." 
The Hawai# i Supreme Court has not yet addressed the 
issue of which statute of limitations period applies to wrongful 
foreclosure claims. In 
Malabe v. Association of Apartment Owners 
of Executive Centre, No. CAAP-17-0000145, 2018 WL 6258564, at *3 n.6
 (Haw. App. Nov. 29, 2018) (SDO), this court recently rejected 
a party's request to "conclude that a cause of action for wrongful foreclosure is subject to the two-year statute of 
limitations provision under HRS § 657-7." In rejecting such a 
conclusion, we cited, for example, Hungate v. Law Office of David 
B. Rosen, 139 Hawai# i 394, 400, 391 P.3d 1, 7 (2017), in which 
the Hawai 
#i Supreme Court recognized the validity of a wrongful 
foreclosure claim in a complaint filed four years after the 
foreclosure sale at issue. Malabe, 2018 WL 6258564, at *3 n.6. 
In other words, the supreme court's recognition of the validity of a wrongful foreclosure claim in a complaint filed four years 
after the foreclosure sale at issue indicates that the two-year 
statute of limitations did not apply. 
In determining whether the statute of limitations under 
HRS § 657-1 or § 657-7 applies, the question is not whether the 
action is ex contractu or ex delicto, but whether or not the 
7 HRS  §  657-1(4)  provides:  "The  following  actions  shall  be  commenced
within  six  years  next  after  the  cause  of  action  accrued,  and  not  after:  .  .  .
(4)  Personal  actions  of  any  nature  whatsoever  not  specifically  covered  by  the
laws  of  the  State." 
8 HRS § 657-7 provides: "Actions for the recovery of compensation for
damage or injury to persons or property shall be instituted within two years
after the cause of action accrued, and not after, except as provided in section657-13."

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
plaintiff is suing for damage or injury to persons or property. 
Gomez v. Am. Airlines, Inc., 111 Hawai# i 67, 69, 137 P.3d 381, 
383 (2006). The relevant limitations period is determined by the nature of the claim or right asserted, which is in turn 
determined from the allegations contained in the pleadings. 
Au v. Au, 63 Haw. 210, 214, 626 P.2d 173, 177 (1981). 
The supreme court has interpreted HRS § 657-7 "to apply 
to 'claims for damages resulting from 
physical injury to persons 
or 
physical injury to tangible interests in property.'" Gomez, 
111 Hawai# i at 70, 137 P.3d at 384 (emphasis in original) 
(quoting Au, 63 Haw. at 216, 626 P.2d at 178). On the other hand, the supreme court has applied HRS § 657-1 to claims 
concerning a non-physical injury to an intangible interest of the 
plaintiff. Higa v. Mirikitani, 55 Haw. 167, 170-73, 517 P.2d 1, 
4-6 (1973) (applying the six-year statute of limitations of HRS § 657-1(1)
9 to a legal malpractice claim involving non-physical 
injury to an intangible interest). 
In this case, the Delapinias did not allege any 
physical harm to the Property. Rather, the Delapinias contended that Nationstar and Fannie Mae wrongfully deprived them of their 
ownership interest in the Property, namely, title and the right 
to possession. In other words, the Delapinias alleged that the 
foreclosure caused non-physical injury to their intangible 
interests. Thus, the six-year statute of limitations under HRS § 
657-1 applies. 
HRS § 657-1 provides: 
§657-1 Six years.  The following actions shall be
commenced within six years next after the cause of action
accrued, and not after:
(1) Actions for the recovery of any debt foundedupon any contract, obligation, or liability, 
9 The Higa court cited the 1968 version of HRS § 657-1(1), which
provided: "The following actions shall be commenced within six years next after
the cause of action accrued, and not after: (1) Actions for the recovery of anydebt founded upon any contract, obligation, or liability, excepting such as arebrought upon the judgment or decree of some court of record[.]"
The current version of the statute, HRS § 657-1(1) (2016), is
substantially identical. 
9 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
excepting such as are brought upon the judgment
or decree of a court; excepting further thatactions for the recovery of any debt foundedupon any contract, obligation, or liability madepursuant to chapter 577A shall be governed bychapter 577A;
(2) Actions upon judgments or decrees rendered inany court not of record in the State, or,subject to section 657-9, in any court of recordin any foreign jurisdiction;
(3) Actions for taking or detaining any goods orchattels, including actions in the nature ofreplevin; and
(4) Personal actions of any nature whatsoever notspecifically covered by the laws of the State. 
As the Delapinias' wrongful foreclosure claim does not fall under 
HRS § 657-1(1)-(3), we further conclude that the Delapinias' 
wrongful foreclosure claim is governed by the catch-all provision 
under HRS § 657-1(4). 
2. The Delapinias' deprivation of ownership wrongful
foreclosure claim accrued, at the earliest, onJanuary 11, 2011, when title to the Property wastransferred to Fannie Mae. 
As to the accrual of the wrongful foreclosure claim, 
Nationstar and Fannie Mae argue that the Delapinias knew or 
should have known of the facts supporting their wrongful 
foreclosure claim when the Notice of Sale was filed on March 30, 
2010, and that the six-year statute of limitations began to 
accrue at that time. At the very latest, Nationstar and Fannie 
Mae argue, the claim accrued after the original foreclosure sale 
scheduled for April 23, 2010, did not occur. 
The Delapinias argue that their wrongful foreclosure 
claim did not accrue until the foreclosure sale was completed. 
The Delapinias further assert that the foreclosure sale was not 
complete until the Foreclosure Affidavit and the new deed were 
recorded. 
In Santiago v. Tanaka, 137 Hawai# i 137, 158-59, 366 
P.3d 612, 633-34 (2016), the supreme court, based on its power to 
fashion equitable relief in foreclosure cases, and where the 
subject property had been sold to a third party, recognized a 
wrongful foreclosure claim to obtain restitution for "proven out-
10 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of-pocket losses." 
Similarly, in Hungate, the supreme court 
expressed: "When voiding the foreclosure is not possible, the 
mortgagor is entitled to 'restitution of their proven 
out-of-pocket losses' through a wrongful foreclosure claim." 139 
Hawai# i at 407, 391 P.3d at 14 (quoting Santiago, 137 Hawai# i at 
158, 366 P.3d at 633). 
The Delapinias did not challenge Nationstar's and 
Fannie Mae's right to foreclose. Rather, the Delapinias only claimed that the Mortgage and HRS Chapter 667, Part I, imposed 
legal duties upon Nationstar and Fannie Mae to conduct the 
foreclosure in a prescribed manner. 
The Delapinias claimed that Nationstar and Fannie Mae 
breached their contractual and statutory duties in a number of 
ways, for example: failure to serve a notice of acceleration that 
complied with paragraph 22 of the Mortgage; failure to properly 
describe the Property in the Notice of Sale; failure to advertise 
the foreclosure auction more than 28 days before the auction date 
as required by HRS § 667-7 (Supp. 2010); failure to have a 
Hawai# i attorney perform the acts required by the power of sale; 
failure to issue written notice of the postponement of the auction; and failure to record a lawful affidavit of foreclosure. 
The Delapinias claimed that, because Nationstar and 
Fannie Mae breached their contractual and statutory duties while 
performing the nonjudicial power of sale foreclosure, they "were 
wrongfully deprived of the title, possession and use of their 
real property[.]" The FAC did not allege the tort of slander of 
title; accordingly, the allegedly improper recordation of the 
Notice of Sale and the Affidavit of Foreclosure were not 
themselves actionable, since those documents did not operate to 
divest the Delapinias of title to the Property. The alleged 
breach of Nationstar's and Fannie Mae's duties was not a cause of 
injury to the Delapinias until they actually lost title to the 
Property. The Delapinias were not deprived of their title to the 
Property until January 11, 2011, when Nationstar deeded the 
11 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Property to Fannie Mae, or until February 16, 2011, when the
Fannie Mae deed was recorded in the Bureau of Conveyances.  
Under Hawaii's discovery rule, the statute of
limitations begins to run when the plaintiff "discovers or
should have discovered the negligent act, the damage, andthe causal connection between the former and the latter." Yamaguchi v. Queen's Medical Center, 65 Haw. 84, 90, 648P.2d 689, 693–94 (1982). Our courts have employed this rulein several contexts. Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Newtown
Meadows v. Venture 15, Inc., 115 Hawai #i 232, 167 P.3d 225
(2007) (defective construction); Blair v. Ing, 95 Hawai #i 
247, 21 P.3d 452 (2001) (legal malpractice); Russell v.Attco, Inc., 82 Hawai #i 461, 923 P.2d 403 (1996) (premises
liability); Yamaguchi v. Queen's Medical Center, 65 Haw. 84,648 P.2d 689 (1982) (medical malpractice). 
Thomas v. Kidani, 126 Hawai# i 125, 132, 267 P.3d 1230, 1237 
(2011). 
Here, the Delapinias did not claim that the price paid 
for the Property was inadequate, so that a deficiency judgment 
should be vacated, or they should be entitled to a larger surplus 
if the winning bid price exceeded their indebtedness; they 
claimed that the Fannie Mae deed and the Cole deed are void. 
Since the actual damage being claimed was the loss of title, the 
damage occurred when title was transferred to someone other than 
the Delapinias. The earliest this could be is January 11, 2011. 
The Delapinias timely initiated this action on August 5, 2016, 
within the six-year statute of limitations provided in HRS § 657-
1(4). 
Therefore, the circuit court erred in concluding that 
the Delapinias' wrongful foreclosure claim was time-barred and in 
granting Nationstar and Fannie Mae's MJP on this basis. We 
remand this matter to the circuit court to address the merits of 
Delapinias' wrongful foreclosure claim against Nationstar and 
Fannie Mae. 
B. Quiet Title and Ejectment Claims Against Nationstar and
Fannie Mae 
The Delapinias also assert claims for quiet title and 
ejectment against Nationstar and Fannie Mae. As to Nationstar 
and Fannie Mae, we do not construe these claims as separate 
12 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
claims for relief, but rather as remedies sought for the wrongful 
foreclosure claim also brought against them. 
However, neither 
Nationstar nor Fannie Mae assert title to or possession of the Property. Accordingly, return of the Property is not an 
available remedy for the Delapinias' wrongful foreclosure claim 
against Nationstar and Fannie Mae. As to these defendants, who 
are not alleged to currently hold any title to the Property, the 
appropriate remedy is an action for damages or restitution. 
Mount v. Apao, 139 Hawai# i 167, 180, 384 P.3d 1268, 1281 (2016); 
Santiago, 137 Hawai# i at 158, 366 P.3d at 633. 
C. Quiet Title and Ejectment Claims Against Cole, ASB, and MERS 
The Delapinias argue that the circuit court erred in 
granting Cole and ASB's MTD by concluding that Cole was a bona fide purchaser and that the foreclosure sale was merely voidable. 
The Delapinias also assert that the circuit court erred in 
granting MERS' MTD by concluding that the Delapinias failed to 
state a claim. Specifically, the Delapinias argue that the 
circuit court erred in concluding that: MERS, as Cole's 
mortgagee, was also protected by bona fide status; the Delapinias 
did not allege that they have paid or are able to pay off the 
loan; and the Notice of Sale and Foreclosure Affidavit complied 
with the Mortgage and HRS Chapter 667, Part I. 
To overcome an HRCP Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a 
complaint must satisfy HRCP Rule 8(a) and our traditional notice 
pleading standard. See Bank of Am., N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 143 
Hawai# i 249, 263, 428 P.3d 761, 775 (2018). The pleading must 
contain "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that 
the pleader is entitled to relief." 
HRCP Rule 8(a)(1) (2000). 
The statement must also "give[] the defendant fair notice of the claim and the ground upon which it rests." Reyes-Toledo, 143 
Hawai# i at 258, 428 P.3d at 770 (quoting Hall v. Kim
, 53 Haw. 
215, 221, 491 P.2d 541, 545 (1971)). "[A] complaint should not 
be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears 
beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in 
13 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
support of [the] claim which would entitle [the plaintiff] to 
relief." Id.
 (quoting Hall, 53 Haw. at 221-22, 491 P.2d at 545). 
Notably, 
[i]n an action to quiet title, the burden is on the
plaintiff to prove title in and to the land in dispute, and,absent such proof, it is unnecessary for the defendant tomake any showing. The plaintiff has the burden to proveeither that he has paper title to the property or that heholds title by adverse possession. While it is not necessary for the plaintiff to have perfect title toestablish a prima facie case, he must at least prove that hehas a substantial interest in the property and that histitle is superior to that of the defendants. 
Ibbetson v. Kaiawe, 143 Hawai# i 1, 17, 422 P.3d 1, 17 (2018) 
(quoting Maui Land & Pineapple Co. v. Infiesto, 76 Hawai# i 402, 
407-08, 879 P.2d 507, 512-13 (1994)). 
The Hawai# i Supreme Court has held that, "[w]here it is 
determined that the nonjudicial foreclosure of a property is 
wrongful, the sale of the property is invalid and voidable at the 
election of the mortgagor, who shall then regain title to and 
possession of the property." Santiago, 137 Hawai# i at 158, 366 
P.3d at 633. 
However, a plaintiff is not entitled to return of 
title to or possession of a wrongfully foreclosed property if it 
was subsequently sold to a bona fide purchaser. Mount, 139 
Hawai# i at 180, 384 P.3d at 1281 (quoting Santiago, 137 Hawai# i at 
158, 366 P.3d at 633). 
In that case, an action at law for 
damages is generally the appropriate remedy. Id. (quoting 
Santiago, 137 Hawai# i at 158, 366 P.3d at 633). 
An innocent or bona fide purchaser is "one who, by an 
honest contract or agreement, purchases property or acquires an 
interest therein, without knowledge, or means of knowledge 
sufficient to charge him in law with knowledge, of any infirmity 
in the title of the seller." Ka
#u Agribusiness Co., Inc. v. 
Heirs or Assigns of Ahulau, 105 Hawai# i 182, 193, 95 P.3d 613, 
624 (2004). 
"A non-bona fide purchaser is one who does not pay 
adequate consideration, 'takes with knowledge that his transferor acquired title by fraud[,] or . . . buys registered land with 
full notice of the fact that it is in litigation between the 
14 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
transferor and a third party.'" Kondaur Capital Corp. v. 
Matsuyoshi, 136 Hawai# i 227, 240 n.27, 361 P.3d 454, 467 n.27 
(2015) (alterations in original) (quoting Akagi v. Oshita
, 33 
Haw. 343, 347 (1935)). 
Thus, in order for the Delapinias' quiet title and 
ejectment claims against Cole, ASB, and MERS to survive 
dismissal, the Delapinias needed to allege that they have a 
substantial interest in the Property and that their interest in 
the Property is greater than that of Cole, ASB, and MERS. See 
Reyes-Toledo, 143 Hawai# i at 265, 428 P.3d at 777. 
Insofar as the Delapinias challenge the circuit court's 
dismissal of the quiet title claim against MERS based on its holding that the Delapinias did not "allege that they have paid 
or are able to tender the amount of indebtedness that would be 
due under the mortgage[,]" we conclude that this point has no 
merit. The tender rule is based on the principle that a 
plaintiff seeking to quiet title "must at least prove that he has 
a substantial interest in the property and that his title is 
superior to that of the defendants." Maui Land & Pineapple Co., 
76 Haw. at 408, 879 P.2d at 513. The tender rule requires a borrower, in bringing a quiet title action, to allege that he has 
paid, or is able to tender, the amounts owed. Klohs v. Wells 
Fargo Bank, N.A., 901 F. Supp. 2d 1253, 1262-63 (D. Haw. 2012). The tender requirement does not apply "where the borrower brings 
a quiet title claim against a party who, according to the 
allegations in the Complaint (which the court accepts as true), 
is not a mortgagee and who otherwise has no interest in the 
property whatsoever." Id. at 1263 n.6 (emphasis added) (internal 
quotation marks omitted) (quoting Amina v. Bank of New York Mellon, Civil No. 11-00714 JMS/BMK, 2012 WL 3283513, at *4 (D. 
Haw. Aug. 9, 2012)). 
The exception does not apply in this case because, 
based on the Delapinias' allegations in the FAC, MERS has an 
interest in the Property. In the portion of the FAC describing 
15             
               
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the parties to the action, the Delapinias described MERS as "a 
foreign corporation which is and at all relevant times was doing 
business in Hawaii, and which claims to hold a mortgage on the 
Property as nominee." In their quiet title count, the Delapinias 
alleged that "Defendant Cole has purported to grant a first 
mortgage on the Property to Defendant MERS as nominee of 
'Pinnacle Capital Mortgage Corporation[.]'" Thus, where MERS has 
an interest in the Property according to the allegations in the 
FAC, the tender rule applies. It is undisputed that the 
Delapinias did not allege either that "they have paid off 
[Nationstar Mortgage] or are prepared to tender all amounts 
owing" to Nationstar such as is necessary to establish superior 
title and maintain a quiet title action. Id. at 1262. The 
circuit court therefore did not err in relying on this as a basis for dismissing the quiet title claim against MERS. Accordingly, 
we affirm the circuit court's granting of MERS' MTD.
10 
As to Cole and ASB, in relevant part, the Delapinias 
alleged in their FAC that: (1) they are the owners of the 
Property; (2)
 Nationstar failed to strictly comply with HRS 
Chapter 667, Part I, and the power of sale in the Mortgage, causing the nonjudicial foreclosure sale and subsequent transfers 
of the Property to be void as a matter of law; (3) the subject 
deeds were void ab initio; (4) all subsequent purchasers had 
constructive notice of the deficiencies with the foreclosure 
process; and (5) Cole cannot claim bona fide purchaser status 
because she had record notice of the publicly recorded chain of 
title and the deficiencies with the foreclosure process from the 
Foreclosure Affidavit and the terms of sale in the Notice of 
Sale. 
In asserting that the subject foreclosure was wrongful, 
the Delapinias alleged multiple violations of the Mortgage terms 
10 Cole and ASB did not raise the tender rule in arguing for dismissal
of the Delapinias' claims against them and we thus do not reach the issue as to
these defendants.

        FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and HRS Chapter 667, Part I, including, inter alia: the 
Delapinias were not served with a notice of acceleration that 
complied with Paragraph 22 of the Mortgage, there was no written 
publication of any postponed auction date,11 and the foreclosure 
sale did not occur on a published date. We take these factual allegations to be true for purposes of this appeal. See In re 
Estate of Rogers, 103 Hawai# i at 280-81, 81 P.3d at 1195-96. 
These allegations were sufficient to satisfy our traditional 
notice pleading standard. 
To the extent that the Delapinias alleged that a 
wrongful foreclosure voided the sale and all subsequent 
transfers, we reject this contention as a matter of law. The 
Delapinias cited Silva v. Lopez, 5 Haw. 262 (Haw. Kingdom 1884), 
and Lee v. HSBC Bank USA, 121 Hawai# i 287, 218 P.3d 775 (2009), 
to support their allegation that a wrongful foreclosure sale is void and not merely voidable, asserting that the cases have not 
been overruled. While it is true that the supreme court has not 
expressly overruled 
Silva, the supreme court has more recently 
held that improper foreclosure sales are voidable. 
In 
Kondaur, the supreme court held that a mortgagee's 
failure to prove that it conducted a nonjudicial foreclosure properly "would render the foreclosure sale voidable and [the 
sale] could therefore be set aside at the timely election of the 
mortgagor." 136 Hawai# i at 240, 361 P.3d at 467. Similarly, in 
Santiago, the supreme court held that an improperly conducted nonjudicial foreclosure of a property is invalid and voidable at 
11 In their Opening Brief, the Delapinias also argue that the circuit
court erred in concluding that written publication of an auction postponement is
not necessary. We conclude that it was error for the circuit court to rely onthis reasoning as a basis for dismissal of the Delapinias' complaint. The relevant part of the power of sale clause in the Mortgage stated: "If Lenderinvokes the power of sale, . . . Lender shall publish a notice of sale and shallsell the Property at the time and place and under the terms specified in thenotice of sale." (Emphases added.) In addressing identical language in anothermortgage agreement, the supreme court has held that, where there are tworeasonable interpretations of this clause, the more stringent interpretationrequiring publication of postponements of the foreclosure sale prevails.Hungate , 139 Hawai #i at 404, 391 P.3d at 11. 
17 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the election of the mortgagor. 137 Hawai# i at 158, 366 P.3d at 
633. 
The court recognized that voiding a foreclosure sale may 
not always be practicable, particularly in situations where the
subject property has already been resold to a third party. Id.  
In Mount
, the supreme court cited Silva in noting that, 
as far back as 1884, the court has voided a mortgage sale of real 
estate and livestock for failure to comply with the conditions of 
the power of sale. 139 Hawai# i at 180, 384 P.3d at 1281.  The 
supreme court also noted its holding in Lee that "an agreement created at a foreclosure sale conducted pursuant to HRS section 
667-5 is void and unenforceable where the foreclosure sale is 
invalid under the statute." Id. (internal quotation marks 
omitted) (quoting Lee, 121 Hawai# i at 296, 218 P.3d at 784). 
However, the supreme court distinguished Lee as a case in which 
the foreclosure sale was not actually completed. Id. The court 
likened the facts in Mount to those in Santiago, where a third party purchaser completed the sale, took possession of the 
property, and had had the property for some time. Id. The 
supreme court then recited its holding in Santiago that "where it is determined that the nonjudicial foreclosure of a property is 
wrongful, the sale of the property is invalid and voidable at the 
election of the mortgagor[.]" Id. (brackets and internal 
quotation marks omitted) (quoting Santiago, 137 Hawai# i at 158, 
366 P.3d at 633). 
In light of the supreme court's more recent holdings, 
we decline to adopt the Delapinias' reliance on Silva and Lee. 
We conclude that improper foreclosure sales are voidable, rather 
than void, and that the supreme court has either distinguished or 
impliedly overruled its earlier decisions holding to the 
contrary. 
Assuming the Delapinias' allegations in their FAC to be 
true, as we must in reviewing a motion to dismiss, In re Estate 
of Rogers, 103 Hawai# i at 280-81, 81 P.3d at 1195-96, the 
Delapinias have made a prima facie case of title. 
The Delapinias 
18 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
were not required to make any allegations pertaining to possible
affirmative defenses in the FAC. 
It was thus improper for the 
circuit court to dismiss the claims based on its conclusion thatCole and ASB were protected by bona fide purchaser status.  
 
We conclude that the Delapinias have pleaded sufficient
factual allegations to support claims for quiet title and 
ejectment against Cole and ASB, under Hawaii's notice pleading 
standard. Accordingly, the circuit court erred in granting Cole 
and ASB's MTD.  
V. CONCLUSION 
Based on the foregoing, we vacate the portion of the 
April 18, 2017 Final Judgment that entered judgment in favor of 
Nationstar, Fannie Mae, Cole, and ASB, and remand this matter to 
the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit for further proceedings 
consistent with this opinion. We affirm the portion of the Final
Judgment that entered judgment in favor of MERS.
