Applicant Intervenor-Appellant Chun Mei Tong, Trustee
 
of the Unrecorded Sun Rise Family Trust dated July 8, 2014 (Tong)
 
appeals from the "Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for
 Confirmation of Sale by Commissioner" (Order Granting
 Confirmation of Sale) and the "Judgment on Order Granting
 Plaintiff's Motion for Confirmation of Sale by Commissioner"
 (Judgment) both entered on April 27, 2017, by the Circuit Court
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
of the First Circuit (circuit court).1 The Order Granting
 
Confirmation of Sale confirmed the sale of the foreclosed
 
property on which Plaintiff Appellee NationStar Mortgage LLC
 (NationStar) had obtained a prior judgment on a decree of
 foreclosure against Defendant Appellees Kathy Jane Balocon
 (Balocon), Association of Apartment Owners of Sun Rise Inc.
 (AOAO), and Ewa by Gentry Community Association (Ewa by Gentry).
 
On appeal, Tong contends that the circuit court erred 
when it denied Tong's request for (1) intervention of right pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 
24(a)(2), (2) permissive intervention pursuant to HRCP Rule 24(b)(2), and (3) joinder pursuant to HRCP Rule 19(a)(2)(A). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Tong's
 points on appeal as follows.
 
It is well-settled that "only parties to a lawsuit . .
 
. may appeal an adverse judgment[.]" Marino v. Ortiz, 484 U.S.
 
301, 304 (1988). "In other words, nonparties, who did not or
 could not intervene, 'are ordinarily denied standing to
 appeal[.]'" Stewart Properties, Inc. v. Brennan, 8 Haw. App.
 
431, 433, 807 P.2d 606, 607 (1991) (footnote and citation
 omitted). As such, because the circuit court indicated its
 intention to deny Tong's Motion to Intervene at the hearing on
 NationStar's motion for confirmation of sale and thereafter,
 issued a minute order denying Tong's Motion to Intervene, Tong's
 status as a non-party raises the issue of standing

 Generally, the requirements of standing to appeal are:
(1) the person must first have been a party to the
action; (2) the person seeking modification of the
order or judgment must have had standing to oppose it
in the trial court; and (3) such person must be
aggrieved by the ruling, i.e., the person must be one
who is affected or prejudiced by the appealable order.

instant appeal from the Order Granting Confirmation of Sale and
 
Judgment.
 
On November 1, 2012, Bank of America, N.A. (BOA), filed
 
its complaint against Balocon, the AOAO, and Ewa by Gentry
 seeking to foreclose on Balocon's property due to her default
 under the mortgage and note. On July 8, 2014, Tong acquired
 title to the mortgaged property subject to Balocon's mortgage by
 means of a nonjudicial foreclosure conducted by the AOAO and
 evidenced by a Quitclaim Deed, recorded in Land Court on
 August 25, 2014.
3 Interest in the mortgage and note for the
 
subject property had been transferred to NationStar and on
 September 29, 2014, NationStar was substituted for BOA in the
 circuit court foreclosure proceeding.
 
On August 12, 2015, NationStar filed its motion for
 
summary judgment and decree of foreclosure, which was granted by
 the circuit court on March 8, 2016. The Findings of Fact,
 Conclusions of Law and Order issued by the circuit court found
 that Tong had acquired her interest in the subject property by
 virtue of AOAO's nonjudicial foreclosure and ordered that upon
 closing of the sale, Tong and Balocon "shall be perpetually
 barred of and from any and all right, title and interest in the
 Mortgaged Property or any part thereof."
 
NationStar filed its Motion for Confirmation of Sale by
 
Commissioner on November 15, 2016. Thereafter, on January 19,
 2017, Tong filed her Motion to Intervene, seeking intervention as
 a right under HRCP Rule 24(a) or, in the alternative,
 substitution for the AOAO pursuant to HRCP Rule 25(a) and (c).
 On February 21, 2017, the circuit court issued a minute order
 denying Tong's Motion to Intervene and ordering NationStar to
 prepare the written order, however upon review of the record, it
 appears that no order was reduced to writing.
 
Although "[a]n order denying an application for

relevant part that if Balocon's default was not cured, the AOAO intends to

intervention under HRCP Rule 24 is a final appealable order under
 
[Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)] ยง 641-1(a)[,]" giving Tong
 standing to appeal, the circuit court never entered any written
 orders on Tong's Motion to Intervene, despite it's oral denial of
 Tong's intervention at the hearing on NationStar's Motion for
 Confirmation of Sale on February 2, 2017 and minute order issued
 by the circuit court on February 21, 2017. Hoopai v. Civil
 
Service Com'n, 106 Hawai' i 205, 215, 103 P.3d 365, 375 (2004). 
The circuit court subsequently entered its Order Granting
 Confirmation of Sale and Judgment without reference to Tong's
 Motion to Intervene, thereby making Tong a nonparty to the
 instant proceeding.
 
However, "a non-party against whom judgment is entered has
standing without having intervened in the [circuit] court
action to appeal the [circuit] court's exercise of
jurisdiction over him." Hal Roach Studios, Inc. v. Richard
 
Feiner & Co. , 896 F.2d 1542, 1546 (9th Cir. 1990) (citations
omitted); see also Thompson v. Freeman , 648 F.2d 1144, 1147
n.5 (8
th Cir. 1981)(noting that, although the appellant was
not a party to the underlying action, it may bring its
present appeal "to contest the district court's jurisdiction
to bind it to the terms of the court's injunction")
(citations omitted); 15A C. Wright, A. Miller & E. Cooper,
Federal Practice & Procedure: Jurisdiction and Related
 
Matters ยง 3902.1, at 44324 (2006) ("The easiest cases for
permitting nonparty appeal are those in which a court order
directly binds the nonparty by name .") (Footnote omitted.)

Hawai'i 251, 276, 151 P.3d 732, 757 (2007). 
Here, the circuit court denied Tong's Motion to
 
Intervene, determining that Tong's intervention was untimely and
 therefore improper. However, the circuit court proceeded to
 include Tong in the Order Granting Confirmation of Sale and
 Judgment in a manner that aggrieved

 The Hawai 'i Supreme Court in State v. Baxley, 102 Hawai 'i 130, 134, 73
P.3d 668, 672 (2003), explained that an "aggrieved party" for purposes of
appellate jurisdiction, is "one whose legal right is invaded by an actcomplained of, or whose pecuniary interest is directly affected by a decree orjudgment. One whose right of property may be established or divested. The word "aggrieved" refers to a substantial grievance, a denial of some personalor property right, or the imposition upon a party of a burden or obligation."

to remove Tong from the subject property. As such, we determine
 
that Tong has standing to appeal.
 
We limit the scope of our review to the Judgment on 
Order Granting Confirmation of Sale and decline to address the issues raised on appeal by Tong regarding her Motion to Intervene as they should be brought on appeal from an Order disposing of Tong's Motion to Intervene. Further, Tong's opening brief does not identify any points of error or arguments on appeal regarding the confirmation of the foreclosure sale and appears to only address the issue of her intervention. As such, any challenge to the confirmation of sale is waived. Weinberg v. Mauch, 78 
Hawai'i 40, 49, 890 P.2d 277, 286 (1995) ("[T]he Mauchs do not 
present an argument as to why the trial court erred by granting the motion. . . . therefore, [they] have not properly presented this issue on appeal, and it is not subject to review by this court."). 
"Generally, '[i]t is elementary that one is not bound 
by a judgment in personam resulting from litigation in which he is not designated as a party or to which he has not been made a party by service of process.'" Kahala Royal Corp., 113 Hawai' i 
at 277, 151 P.3d at 758 (quoting Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 395 U.S. 100, 110 (1969)). Further, "[i]n order for the decree of the lower court to be binding upon such [absent] persons, they must be made parties to the suit, either as plaintiffs or defendants." Haiku Plantations Ass'n v. Lono, 
56 Haw. 96, 102, 529 P.2d 1, 5 (1974). 
Here, as previously stated, the circuit court
 
essentially rendered a binding order and judgment against Tong by
 explicitly naming Tong in the Order and writ of possession. The
 Order Granting Confirmation of Sale identifies Tong as an entity
 that had acquired title to the mortgaged property subject to
 NationStar's mortgage and ordered that Tong "shall be barred of
 and from any and all right, title and interest in and to the
 Property . . . and Purchaser or its nominee shall be entitled to
 immediate exclusive ownership and possession of the Property."
 The writ of possession commands the removal of Tong from the
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
subject property, despite the circuit court's rejection of Tong's
 
attempt to become a party to the proceeding through its denial of
 Tong's intervention. Because Tong was never made a party to the
 action, the circuit court was in no position to render a binding
 adjudication against Tong, as a non-party, from which she was
 aggrieved by the ruling. Therefore, we conclude that the circuit
 court erred only in explicitly including Tong in its Order
 Granting Confirmation of Sale and Judgment and issuing writ of
 possession against Tong.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment on
 
Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Confirmation of Sale by
 Commissioner, filed on April 27, 2017, by the Circuit Court of
 the First Circuit is affirmed in part and vacated in part. The
 portion of Paragraph H of the Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion
 for Confirmation of Sale by Commissioner that explicitly names
 Tong and the portion of the Writ of Possession that explicitly
 names Tong is vacated. The Judgment in all other respects is
 affirmed.
