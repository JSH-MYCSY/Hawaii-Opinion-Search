IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI #I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
CHAMESE KU KELIIKOA, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
(CASE NO. 3DTA-17-00446)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Fujise and Chan, JJ.)
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
appellate jurisdiction over Defendant-Appellant Chamese Ku
Keliikoa's (Appellant Keliikoa) appeal from the Honorable Harry
P. Freitas's April 5, 2017 interlocutory order acknowledging
Appellant Keliikoa's plea of not guilty to Plaintiff-Appellee
State of Hawaii's (Appellee State) criminal complaint for failing
to appear in answer to a citation in violation of Hawaii Revised
Statutes (HRS) ยง 803-6(e) (2014) and directing Appellant Keliikoa
to appear on May 10, 2017 for a pretrial conference in district
court criminal case number 3DTA-17-00446.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
"The right to an appeal is strictly statutory."  State
v. Ontiveros, 82 Hawai# i 446, 449, 923 P.2d 388, 391 (1996)
(citation omitted).  The Hawai #i Intermediate Court of Appeals
has jurisdiction "[t]o hear and determine appeals from any court
or agency when appeals are allowed by law[.]"  HRS ยง 602-57(1)
(2016).  HRS ยง 641-12 (2016) is the statute providing that
"[a]ppeals upon the record shall be allowed from all final
decisions and final judgments of district courts in all criminal
matters."  Consequently, "in order to appeal a criminal matter in
the district court, the appealing party must appeal from a
written judgment or order that has been filed with the clerk of
the court pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(b)(3)."  State v. Bohannon , 102
Hawai#i 228, 236, 74 P.3d 980, 988 (2003); see also  Rule 32(c)(2)
of the Hawai# i Rules of Penal Procedure.  And even when the
district court enters a judgment of conviction, "[j]udgments of
conviction are not final unless they include the final
adjudication and the final sentence."  State v. Kilborn , 109
Hawai#i 435, 442, 127 P.3d 95, 102 (App. 2005) (dismissing an
appeal from a district court judgment of conviction that did not
finally determine the entire sentence).  In the instant case, the
district court has not yet held a trial, much less rendered a
final decision, on Appellee State's criminal complaint against
Appellant Keliikoa in district court criminal case number 
3DTA-17-00446.  Absent an appealable final judgment or order, we
lack appellate jurisdiction over the April 5, 2017 order, and
Appellant Keliikoa's appeal is premature.
