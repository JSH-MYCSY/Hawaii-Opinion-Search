NO. CAAP-17-0000394
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
TERI W. PEDRO, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 3DTA-17-00968)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Fujise and Chan, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
appellate jurisdiction over Defendant-Appellant Teri W. Pedro's
 
(Appellant Pedro) appeal from the April 17, 2017 pretrial order
 that the Honorable Margaret K. Masunaga entered in district court
 Criminal No. 3DTA-17-00968 while the underlying case was pending
 before the district court. 
We note that on May 15, 2017, the
 
district court entered an order formally committing, and, thus,
 transferring, this district court case to the circuit court,
 where it received a new case number, namely Criminal No. 
3CPC-17-0000310, where it is still awaiting a trial on the
 merits.
 
"The right to an appeal is strictly statutory." State
 
v. Ontiveros, 82 Hawai
'i 446, 449, 923 P.2d 388, 391 (1996) 
(citation omitted). The Hawai 'i Intermediate Court of Appeals NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
has jurisdiction "[t]o hear and determine appeals from any court
 
or agency when appeals are allowed by law[.]" Hawaii Revised
 Statutes (HRS) ยง 602-57(1) (2016). 
In a circuit court criminal case, a defendant may 
appeal from a judgment of conviction that imposes a sentence pursuant to HRS ยง 641-11 (2016), from an interlocutory order that the circuit court certifies for appeal pursuant to HRS ยง 641-17 (2016), or from an interlocutory order denying a motion to dismiss based on double jeopardy pursuant to the collateral order doctrine. State v. Kealaiki, 95 Hawai
'i 309, 312, 22 P.3d 588, 
591 (2001). The April 7, 2017 order does not satisfy the requirements for any of these three categories of appealable orders and judgments, and the circuit court has not yet entered a final judgment in Criminal No. 3CPC-17-0000310. The April 7, 2017 order merely acknowledges Appellant Pedro's plea as to each charge, and sets a date for a pre-trial conference. 
"An appellate court has . . . an independent obligation 
to ensure jurisdiction over each case and to dismiss the appeal sua sponte if a jurisdictional defect exists." State v. 
Graybeard, 93 Hawai
'i 513, 516, 6 P.3d 385, 388 (App. 2000) 
(citation omitted). "A jurisdictional defect in an appeal cannot be waived by the parties or disregarded by us. We must dismiss an appeal on our own motion if we lack jurisdiction." State v. 
Johnston, 63 Haw. 9, 10, 619 P.2d 1076, 1077 (1980) (citations omitted). Absent an appealable judgment or order, we lack appellate jurisdiction over the April 7, 2017 order.
