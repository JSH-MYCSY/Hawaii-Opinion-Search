(CASE NO. 3DCW-17-0001047)
 
ORDER
 
CONSOLIDATING CASE NUMBERS CAAP-17-0000398,
CAAP-18-0000305, CAAP-18-0000431 AND
CAAP-18-0000519 UNDER CASE NUMBER CAAP-17-0000398
 
AND 
DISMISSING CONSOLIDATED APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Reifurth and Chan, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record of district court criminal
 
case number 3DCW-17-0001047 for resulting appeals in appellate
 
court case numbers CAAP-17-0000398, CAAP-18-0000305, CAAP-18­0000431 and CAAP-18-0000519, it appears that we lack appellate
 jurisdiction pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641­12(a) (2016). 
In these four appeals, Defendant-Appellant Alfred
 
Napahueluna Spinney (Spinney), pro se, appeals from the Honorable
 Margaret Masunaga's April 27, 2017 interlocutory order, March 29,
 2018 interlocutory order, April 2, 2018 interlocutory order, and
 May 23, 2018 judgment dismissing with prejudice Plaintiff-
Appellee State of Hawaii's complaint against Spinney for criminal
 contempt of court in violation of HRS § 710-1077 (2014 & Supp.
 2017). Under these circumstances, the consolidation and
 dismissal of these four appeals is warranted.
 
"The right of appeal in a criminal case is purely 
statutory[.]" State v. Nicol, 140 Hawai' i 482, 485, 403 P.3d 
259, 262 (2017) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The Hawai' i Intermediate Court of Appeals has jurisdiction "[t]o 
hear and determine appeals from any court or agency when appeals are allowed by law[.]" HRS § 602-57(1) (2016). HRS § 641-12(a) is the statute providing that "[a]ppeals upon the record shall be allowed from all final decisions and final judgments of district 
2

courts in all criminal matters." Consequently, "in order to 
appeal a criminal matter in the district court, the appealing party must appeal from a written judgment or order that has been filed with the clerk of the court pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(b)(3)." State v. Bohannon, 102 Hawai' i 228, 236, 74 P.3d 980, 988 (2003); 
see also Rule 32(c)(2) of the Hawai' i Rules of Penal Procedure; 
State v. Kilborn, 109 Hawai' i 435, 442, 127 P.3d 95, 102 (App. 
2005) (regarding the appealability of a district court judgment of conviction); State v. Hern, 133 Hawai' i 59, 62, 323 P.3d 1241, 
1244 (App. 2013) (regarding the appealability of a district court judgment dismissing the complaint without prejudice). 
In the instant four appeals, the April 27, 2017 order,
 
the March 29, 2018 order, the April 2, 2018 order and the May 23,
 2018 judgment of dismissal with prejudice are not independently
 appealable under HRS § 641-12. In addition, the May 23, 2018
 judgment dismissing the State's complaint with prejudice in
 district court criminal number 3DCW-17-0001047 appears to have
 rendered moot all four of Spinney's appeals. 
A case is moot where the question to be determined is
abstract and does not rest on existing facts or
rights. . . . Hence, the mootness doctrine is properly
invoked where events have so affected relations between the
 parties that the two conditions for justiciability relevant
on appeal — adverse interest and effective remedy — have
been compromised.
 
State v. Durham, 125 Hawai' i 114, 127, 254 P.3d 425, 438 (2011) 
(citation, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted). 
"Thus, a case is moot if the reviewing court can no longer grant effective relief." State v. Tui, 138 Hawai' i 462, 468, 382 P.3d 
274, 280 (2016) (citation, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted). "Appellate courts generally do not decide moot questions." State v. Kiese, 126 Hawai' i 494, 508, 273 P.3d 1180, 
1194 (2012). We lack appellate jurisdiction over all four appeals. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
 
case numbers CAAP-17-0000398, CAAP-18-0000305, CAAP-18-0000431
 and CAAP-18-0000519 are consolidated under appellate court case

number CAAP-17-0000398. The appellate court clerk shall file a
 
copy of this order in appellate court case numbers CAAP-17­0000398, CAAP-18-0000305, CAAP-18-0000431 and CAAP-18-0000519.
 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that the consolidated
 
appeals in appellate court case number CAAP-17-0000398 are
 dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
