SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Chan, JJ.) 
These two appeals, which have been consolidated by this 
court, arise out of a judicial foreclosure action initiated by 
Plaintiff-Appellee U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee for the C-Bass Mortgage Loan Asset-Backed Certificates, Series 2007-CB1 (U.S. Bank) against Defendant-Appellant Jung Hoon Kim (Kim) 
in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit (circuit court). 
In CAAP-17-0000402, Kim appeals from a "Judgment [on 
the Decree of Foreclosure]" (Foreclosure Judgment), entered pursuant to the "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order 
Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment for Foreclosure Against all Defendants and For Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure" (
Decree of Foreclosure Order), both filed on October 
31, 2016.   Kim also challenges an "Order Denying Defendant Jung 
Hoon Kim's Non-Hearing Motion for Reconsideration of this Court's (1) Plaintiff's Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Granting Summary Judgment For Foreclosure Against all Defendants and For Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure, and (2) Judgment Thereon, Filed on 10/31/2016" (Order Denying Reconsideration), 
filed on April 17, 2017. 1
In CAAP-17-0000700, Kim appeals from a "Judgment [on 
the Confirmation of Sale]" (Confirmation of Sale Judgment), 
entered pursuant to an "Order Confirming Foreclosure Sale, 
Approving Commissioner's Report, Allowance of Commissioner's Fees, Attorneys' Fees, Costs, Directing Conveyance and For Writ of Ejectment" (Order Confirming Sale
), both filed on September 
15, 2017.2 
In both appeals, Kim contends that the circuit court 
erred because: (1) there were factual issues concerning U.S. Bank's standing; and (2) the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to 
1  The Honorable Glenn S. Hara presided over the relevant proceedings in
CAPP-17-0000402. 
2  The Honorable Henry T. Nakamoto and Harry P. Freitas presided over
the relevant Confirmation of Sale proceedings in CAAP-17-0000700.

foreclose on Kim because he had timely cancelled his mortgage 
loan pursuant to the Truth-In-Lending Act (TILA). 
Upon careful review of the record and briefs submitted 
by the parties and having given due consideration to the arguments and issues they raise, as well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Kim's points of error as follows, and we vacate and remand. 
(1) Standing 
Kim's point of error regarding standing is dispositive 
under Bank of America, N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai# i 361, 390 
P.3d 1248 (2017).  Under Reyes-Toledo, a foreclosing plaintiff 
must establish its standing, or entitlement to enforce the subject note, at the time the action was commenced in order to establish its right to foreclose on the subject property.  139 Hawai# i
 at 367-71, 390 P.3d at 1254-58.  This can be established 
through admissible evidence showing that the foreclosing plaintiff was in possession of the note at the time the complaint was filed.  Id. at 370-71, 390 P.3d at 1257-58.  The requirement that a foreclosing plaintiff must establish possession also applies when a specially endorsed note is at issue.  See US BankNational Association as Trustee for J.P. Morgan Mortgage Acquisition Trust 2006-WF1 v. Julio, No. CAAP-16-0000418, 2018 WL 5726370, at *2 (Hawai# i App. October 31, 2018); CitiMortgage Inc. 
v. Mather-Gemelli, No. CAAP-15-0000707, 2017 WL 2169857, at *1-2 (Hawai# i App. May 17, 2017). 
U.S. Bank's "Complaint For Mortgage Foreclosure" 
(Complaint) filed on February 2, 2015 alleges, inter alia, that 
it "is the current holder of the Note with standing to prosecute 
the instant action as the Note has been duly indorsed and because [U.S. Bank] is currently in rightful possession of the endorsed Note."  However, U.S. Bank did not provide evidence to support this assertion. 
Like the foreclosing bank in Reyes-Toledo, U.S. Bank 
was granted a decree of foreclosure by way of summary judgment. In support of its motion, U.S. Bank attached, 
inter alia: (1) a 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"Declaration of Prior Business Records" by Vanessa Lewis, 
Contract Management Coordinator for Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC, servicer for U.S. Bank, executed on December 17, 2015; (2) a "Declaration in Support of Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment", also by Vanessa Lewis, executed on November 16, 2015, (collectively the Lewis Declarations); (3) a "Declaration of 
Counsel" (Cotton Declaration), by Jason L. Cotton, counsel for 
U.S. Bank, executed on April 15, 2016; and (4) a copy of the 
"Adjustable Rate Note" (the Note), which indicates that New 
Century Mortgage Corporation (New Century) was the lender for the 
Note, and that New Century specially indorsed the Note to U.S. 
Bank. 
As U.S. Bank concedes in its answering brief, and as 
confirmed by our review of the record, there is no evidence in the record to establish that U.S. Bank had possession of the Note at the time it filed its Complaint on February 2, 2015.

U.S. Bank argues that the standing requirements adopted 
in Reyes-Toledo should not be applied retroactively to the instant case.  However, in Reyes-Toledo, the Hawai# i Supreme 
Court applied the standing requirements to the parties in that case and did not rule that the standing requirements should be applied prospectively.  We are required to apply the holdings in Reyes-Toledo. 
Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to 
Kim, as we must for purposes of a summary judgment ruling, there 
3  In the "Declaration in Support of Plaintiff's Motion for Summary
Judgment" executed on November 16, 2015, Vanessa Lewis attested that "[U.S.
Bank] is in possession of an original promissory note dated 07/20/2006[.]"
(Emphasis added).  Further, in the Cotton Declaration, executed on April 15,2016, Jason L. Cotton attested that "TMLF Hawaii, LLLC is in possession of the
[Note,]" and "[i]n representing [U.S. Bank] in this foreclosure action and aspart of our working processes, I have  physical possession of the Note." 
(Emphases added). 
Because the Lewis Declarations and Cotton Declaration do not attest that 
U.S. Bank was in possession of the Note at the time the Complaint was filed on
February 2, 2015, we need not address whether the declarations are appropriateto authenticate the pertinent records under U.S. Bank N.A. v. Mattos, 140
Hawai #i 26, 398 P.3d 615 (2017) and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Behrendt, 142 
Hawai #i 37, 414 P.3d 89 (2018).  
4  (2) TILA NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether U.S. Bank had 
standing when this foreclosure action commenced.  Accordingly, pursuant to Reyes-Toledo, the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment for U.S. Bank on the decree of foreclosure and in entering the subsequent Foreclosure Judgment and Confirmation of Sale Judgment.

With regard to Kim's contention that he cancelled his 
mortgage loan pursuant to TILA, the circuit court rejected Kim's TILA argument.  In this regard, the circuit court orally ruled that U.S. Bank submitted a properly authenticated copy of a Notice of Right to Cancel signed by Kim which was complete (including relevant dates), while Kim relied on an incomplete version of the notice (without relevant dates) which was not authenticated.  The circuit court thus held that there were no genuine issues of material fact regarding Kim's right to cancel. 
However, Kim's declaration regarding the TILA issue 
attests that "I did not receive two completed copies of the 'Notice of Right to Cancel' at closing of the subject loan."  In Hawaii Community Federal Credit Union v. Keka, 94 Hawai# i 213, 
224, 11 P.3d 1, 12 (2000), the 
Hawai# i Supreme Court stated that 
"TILA provides that 'written acknowledgment of receipt of any disclosures required under this subchapter by a person to whom information, forms, and a statement is required to be given pursuant to this section does no more than create a rebuttable presumption of delivery thereof.'"  (Emphasis added). 
The case law of other jurisdictions is well settled that a
debtor's affidavit averring non-delivery is sufficient tocreate a genuine issue of material fact as to whether thestatutory presumption had been rebutted, thereby precluding 
4  U.S. Bank asserts that Kim's challenge to U.S. Bank's standing
regarding the Confirmation of Sale Judgment is barred under the doctrine of
res judicata  pursuant to this court's holdings in Nationstar Mortgage LLC v.
Akepa Properties LLC, No. CAAP-15-0000407, 2017 WL 1401468 (Hawai #i App. April
19, 2017) and Bank of America, N.A. v. Panzo, No. CAAP-14-0001356, 2017 WL
1194002 (Hawai #i App. March 31, 2017).  We conclude this argument lacks merit
because unlike the appellant in Akepa and Panzo, Kim has timely appealed fromthe Foreclosure Judgment.  As such, Kim's challenge to U.S. Bank's standing is 
not precluded under the res judicata  doctrine.

summary judgment with respect to a claim based upon a
debtor's assertion of non-delivery.  Stone v. Mehlberg, 728F.Supp. 1341, 1353–54 (W.D. Mich.1989 & Supp. Opinion 1990);Powers v. Sims & Levin Realtors, 396 F.Supp. 12, 22–23(E.D.Va.1975) ("congressional policy, as expressed by 15U.S.C. § 1635(c), precludes granting a creditor summaryjudgment on the basis of a receipt acknowledgment alonewhere the [debtors] deny by affidavit that they received thedisclosures required by [TILA]"); Cintron v. Bankers TrustCo., 682 So.2d 616, 616–17 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1996); AwardLumber & Constr. Co., Inc. v. Humphries, 110 Ill.App.3d 119,65 Ill.Dec. 676, 441 N.E.2d 1190, 1191–92 (1982) (discussingrelevant case law and concluding that, "while an affidavitof non-delivery from defendant in this case would havesufficed to create a material issue of fact, the mereallegation thereof . . . is insufficient to rebut thepresumption raised by the signed acknowledgment ofreceipt"). 
Id. at 224-25, 11 P.3d at 12-13.  In Keka, the Hawai# i Supreme 
Court held that, although the lender had produced copies of TILA 
disclosures signed by the borrowers, the borrowers' affidavits and declarations asserting they had not received copies of the documents at the time of signing "raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the [lender] timely provided the [borrowers] with the disclosures required by TILA."  Id. at 225, 11 P.3d at 13.
 Given Kim's declaration attesting that he did not 
receive completed copies of the Notice of Right to Cancel at closing of the loan, it appears under Keka that there are genuine issues of material fact as to Kim's contentions under TILA.  We note however, as asserted by U.S. Bank on appeal, that Kim must further establish that TILA is applicable to the loan in question in this case.  Because this case is being remanded, the parties may further address the TILA issues before the circuit court. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: (1)
