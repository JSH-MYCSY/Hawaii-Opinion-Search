APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 12-1-2810)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Chan, JJ.)
Upon review of the record, it appears that under Hawaii
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 667-51(a)(1) (2016) we no longer have
appellate jurisdiction over Defendant/Counterclaim-Plaintiff/
Appellant Lily Asayo Ishihara's (Ishihara) appeal from the
Honorable Bert I. Ayabe's April 20, 2017 judgment on a decree of
foreclosure in favor of Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/
Appellee NationStar Mortgage, LLC (NationStar Mortgage).  During
Ishihara's appeal, an issue arose whether NationStar Mortgage had
sufficiently proved that it had standing to foreclose on
Ishihara's property under the holding in Bank of America v.
Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai# i 361, 364, 390 P.3d 1248, 1251 (2017)
("[A] foreclosing plaintiff seeking summary judgment must prove
it had standing to foreclose on the homeowner's property ast the
commencement of the lawsuit to be entitled to foreclosure of theNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
subject property.").  Pursuant to the procedure in Life of the
Land v. Ariyoshi, 57 Haw. 249, 252, 553 P.2d 464, 466 (1976),1/
Ishihara filed an October 23, 2017 motion for this court to
temporarily remand this case to the circuit court for the entry
of a post-judgment order vacating the appealed April 20, 2017
judgment on a decree of foreclosure pursuant to Rule 60(b) of the
Hawai#i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP).  Notably, NationStar
Mortgage affirmatively stated in its November 19, 2017 responsive
memorandum that NationStar had no objection to Ishihara's
October 23, 2017 motion.  After the entry of our February 23,
2018 order granting Ishihara's October 23, 2017 motion, the
Honorable Jeannette H. Castagnetti entered and supplemented the
record with a March 19, 2018 order vacating the April 20, 2017
judgment on the decree of foreclosure pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b)
and the holding in Reyes-Toledo.  Consequently, the record for
the underlying case no longer contains an appealable final
judgment that is necessary for appellate jurisdiction.
Granted, an order denying  a motion for post-judgment
relief under HRCP Rule 60(b) is an appealable final post-judgment
order under HRS § 641-1(a) (2016).  Ditto v. McCurdy , 103 Hawai# i
153, 160, 103 Hawai #i at 160, 80 P.3d 974, 981 (2003).  In
contrast, however, the March 19, 2018 HRCP Rule 60(b) order
granting  Ishihara's motion to vacate the April 20, 2017 judgment
1/The Supreme Court of Hawai #i has explained that, when parties have
wanted a circuit court to alter or set a side a judgment that was already the
subject of a valid pending appeal,
[j]urisdiction is in this [appellate] court while the appeal
is pending . . . .  Nevertheless, the [HRCP Rule 60(b) post-
judgment] motion may be made and considered in the circuit
court.  If that court indicates that it will grant the
motion, the appellant may then move in this court for a
remand of the case.  During the pendency of the [HRCP
Rule 60(b) post-judgment] motion in the circuit court, the
parties may move in this court for such relief from the
appeal requirements as may be appropriate. . . .
Such [a post-judgment] motion under [HRCP] Rule 60(b)
. . . may be made in the circuit court without a remand of
the case.  In the event that the circuit court determines
that the [post-judgment HRCP Rule 60(b)] motion should be
granted, it should so certify and a motion to remand should
be made in this court.

(emphases added).
-2-NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
on the decree of foreclosure is not independently appealable
because, "[w]hen . . . an order granting a Rule 60(b) motion
merely vacates the judgment and leaves the case pending for
further determination, the order is akin to an order granting a
new trial and, in most instances, is interlocutory and
nonappealable."  12 James Wm. Moore et al., Moore's Federal
Practice § 60.68[2], at 60-233 (3d ed. 2017) (footnote omitted). 
In other words, "[a]n order granting a motion under Rule 60(b)
and ordering a new trial is purely interlocutory and not
appealable, although on appeal from a judgment entered after the
new trial the appellate court will review whether it was error to
have reopened the first judgment."  11 Charles Alan Wright &
Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure  § 2871 at 589-90
(3d ed. 2012 & Supp. 2016) (footnotes omitted).2/
For example, under analogous circumstances involving
post-judgment relief under HRCP Rule 59 rather than HRCP
Rule 60(b), "[a]fter judgment for plaintiffs pursuant to a jury
verdict, [and] defendants were granted a new trial, and
plaintiffs appealed[,]" the Supreme Court of Hawai #i dismissed
the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction because the case
was, in effect, still pending before the circuit court and
"[t]here was no application for or allowance of the appeal by the
court below."  Morneau v. Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, 48 Haw.
534, 534, 404 P.2d 899, 899 (1965) (footnote omitted).
[W]hen a motion for new trial is filed there is no
opportunity to appeal unless the outcome is a denial of the
motion with the consequent reaffirmation of the judgment,
whereupon the appeal lies from the judgment.  If a new trial
is granted and the judgment consequently is set aside there
is no final judgment from which to appeal.  6 Moore, Federal
Practice, § 59.15(1), at 3896 (2d ed.).
2/Although Moore's Federal Practice and Federal Practice and
Procedure analyze Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP),
the Supreme Court of Hawai #i has noted that it patterned HRCP Rule 60(b) after
FRCP Rule 60(b), "and where we have patterned a rule within the HRCP after an
equivalent rule within the FRCP, interpretations of the rule by the federal
courts are deemed to be highly persuasive in the reasoning of this court." 
Kawamata Farms, Inc. v. United Agri Products , 86 Hawai #i 214, 255, 948 P.2d
1055, 1096 (1997).

Id. at 536, 404 P.2d at 900 (emphasis added; footnote omitted). 
"[T]he grant of a new trial does not [automatically substitute a
new judgment], and hence is not appealable as of right."  Id.  
"[U]nder the Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure, an order granting a
new trial is deemed interlocutory[.]"  Id.  at 536 n.3, 404 P.2d
at 900 n.3.  In response to an argument that the circuit court
had erred by entering the order setting aside the judgment and
granting a new trial, the Morneau  court explained that, "[w]hen
and if the order for new trial comes before us for review [by way
of a timely appeal from a future amended judgment,] we will have
occasion to consider such contentions, but not at this time." 
Id. at 537, 404 P.2d at 901.  "An order dismissing the appeal
will be signed on presentation."  Id.
Similarly in the instant case, although the April 20,
2017 judgment on the decree of foreclosure was initially an
appealable final judgment pursuant to HRS § 667-51(a)(1), the
circuit court subsequently obtained this court's permission to
invoke its authority under HRCP Rule 60(b) to vacate the
April 20, 2017 judgment on the decree of foreclosure by way of
its March 19, 2018 order pursuant to the holding in Reyes-Toledo . 
In the current absence of an appealable final judgment, the
rights of the parties in the underlying case are now
undetermined, and the entire matter in Civil No. 12-1-2810-11
(JHC) awaits the circuit court's future adjudication of the
parties' claims on the merits.  Without an appealable final
judgment, the March 19, 2018 HRCP Rule 60(b) order vacating the
April 20, 2017 judgment on the decree of foreclosure is now, in
effect, an interlocutory and non-final order that is currently
ineligible for appellate review.  See Morneau , 48 Haw. at 536,
404 P.2d at 900; Bailey v. DuVauchelle, 135 Hawai #i 482, 491, 353
P.3d 1024, 1033 (2015) ("Absent an underlying appealable final
judgment, the circuit court's rulings on a purported Rule 60(b)
motion are interlocutory and not appealable until entry of such a
judgment."  (Citations omitted)).  Although Ishihara additionally
desires appellate review under HRS § 641-1(a) of a prior 
-4-NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
March 11, 2014 order and May 21, 2014 order that dismissed
Ishihara's counterclaim, "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only
after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment
has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties
pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]"  Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming
& Wright, 76 Hawai# i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994);
Carlisle v. One (1) Boat , 119 Hawai #i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177,
1186 (2008) ("[B]ased on Jenkins  and HRCP Rule 58, an order is
not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the
parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment."). 
When and if the circuit court enters a future amended judgment,
any aggrieved party will be able to obtain appellate review of
all the interlocutory orders by way of a timely appeal from the
future amended judgment under the principle that "[a]n appeal
from a final judgment brings up for review all interlocutory
orders not appealable directly as of right which deal with issues
in the case."  Ueoka v Szymanski, 107 Hawai# i 386, 396, 114 P.3d
892, 902 (2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted);
see, e.g., Morneau , 48 Haw. at 537, 404 P.2d at 901 ("When and if
the order for new trial comes before us for review [by way of a
timely appeal from a future amended judgment,] we will have
occasion to consider such contentions, but not at this time.");
Reyes-Toledo , 139 Hawai# i at 372, 390 P.3d at 1259 ("Homeowner's
appeal of the circuit court's Judgment to the ICA brought up for
review the circuit court's Order Granting Motion to Dismiss
Counterclaims[,] . . . in addition to the Foreclosure Decree.").
