in Limine to Exclude any Extrinsic Evidence Outside of the Court
 
Mittimus Filed on April 28, 2006 (Order Denying Motion in
 
Limine).
 
This is a civil action for damages, in which Fraser
 
alleges that he was kept in prison for 76 days beyond his release
 
date in Cr. No. 05-1-0165. On July 30, 2009, Fraser filed his
 First Amended Complaint (First Amended Complaint) in the Circuit
 
Court, alleging, inter alia: (1) false imprisonment; (2)
 
negligence; (3) liability of the State on a theory of respondeat
 superior; and (4) negligent hiring, supervision, monitoring, and
 instruction by the State of prison official Thomas Read (Read).

After a bench trial and judgment against Fraser, this case was
 previously appealed and remanded.
3 The Circuit Court held a
 
second bench trial on July 11, 2016. On May 9, 2017, the Circuit
 Court entered its Judgment.
 I. BACKGROUND
 A. Background Facts from the Prior Appeal
 The facts in this subsection A are taken primarily from
 
the Memorandum Opinion in the prior appeal in this case. See
 
Fraser v. State, CAAP-12-0000393, 2015 WL 405689, at *1–2 (Haw.
 App. Jan. 30, 2015) (mem. op.).
 
2
 Read was originally a co-defendant with the State, but all claims
against Read were disposed of in an earlier phase of these proceedings and are
not at issue in this appeal.
 
3
 On October 10, 2011, the Circuit Court entered judgment in favor
of the defendants. On March 12, 2011, Fraser filed a Notice of Appeal (CAAP­11-0000746). On March 30, 2012, that appeal was dismissed for lack of
appellate jurisdiction. On April 12, 2012, the Circuit Court entered an
Amended Judgment. On April 18, 2012, Fraser filed another Notice of Appeal
(CAAP-12-0000393). On March 3, 2015, this court vacated the judgment to the
extent that it entered judgment in favor of the State, but affirmed the
judgment as to Read. Fraser, 2015 WL 405689 at *1 n.2.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The question of whether Fraser had been overdetained
 
depended on whether he had received the proper amount of credit
 
for time served with respect to the sentences that determined his
 release date. Fraser and the State agreed that the relevant
 offenses were two counts of first-degree assault against a law
 enforcement officer, Counts 2 and 3, in Cr. No. 05–1–0165. On
 August 9, 2005, the Circuit Court sentenced Fraser on the assault
 charges to concurrent terms of five years of probation, subject
 to a term of imprisonment of 144 days, with credit for time
 served.
4
 
Fraser was subsequently indicted, in Cr. No. 05–1–0580,
 
with attempted promoting of a controlled substance in, on, or
 near a school. On or about February 27, 2006, Fraser was
 arrested for his alleged violation of the terms of his probation
 in Cr. No. 05–1–0165. 
On April 25, 2006, the Circuit Court sentenced Fraser
 
on the drug charge in Cr. No. 05–1–0580 to five years of
 probation, subject to a one-year term of imprisonment, with
 credit of 135 days for time served.
5 On the same date, the
 
Circuit Court revoked Fraser's probation on his assault charges
 in Cr. No. 05–1–0165 and resentenced him to five years of
 probation, subject to a one-year term of imprisonment.

assault charges is not in the record.7 Nor is a transcript of
 
Fraser's resentencing. However, a "Mittimus Warrant of
 
Commitment to Jail" (Mittimus Warrant), signed by a clerk of the
 
Circuit Court, states that the one-year jail term imposed on
 
Counts 2 and 3 in Cr. No. 05–1–0165 are to run concurrently with
 each other and with the term imposed in Cr. No. 05-1-0580, with
 "[c]redit of 135 days of time served." The Mittimus Warrant was
 filed on April 28, 2006. 
The State did not give Fraser 135 days of credit on his
 
one-year jail term in Cr. No. 05-1-0165. Instead, Lieutenant
 Gail Mirkovich (Mirkovich), the intake sergeant at the Maui
 
Community Correctional Center, calculated Fraser's credit for
 
time served on his assault charges as 59 days, which is the
 number of days he spent in custody from his arrest for allegedly
 violating the terms of his probation until he was resentenced. 
After Mirkovich decided that Fraser was only entitled to 59 days
 of credit, she called a clerk for the resentencing judge and
 notified the clerk that Fraser was not entitled to 135 days of
 credit, as reflected in the Mittimus Warrant. After speaking
 with the clerk, Mirkovich "was under the assumption" that she
 should give Fraser 59 days of credit — her calculation of the
 correct credit. However, no amended judgment or other Circuit
 Court order was filed consistent with Mirkovich's calculation of
 Fraser's entitlement to credit for time served. The State
 applied Mirkovich's calculation of the appropriate credit and
 
7
 As discussed later, on June 23, 2009, an Order Revoking Probation
and Resentencing Defendant was entered by Judge Raffetto, which was introduced
at trial and is now in the record in this case.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
released Fraser on February 24, 2007. If the State had granted
 
Fraser 135 days of credit for time served in Cr. No. 05-1-0165,
 he would have been released on December 10, 2006, which was 76
 days earlier.
8
 
B. Disposition of Prior Proceedings on Fraser's Claims
 On July 30, 2010, the Circuit Court granted partial
 
summary judgment in favor of the State, leaving only Fraser's
 "State law tort claims," against the State, namely: negligence,
 respondeat superior (for both negligence and false imprisonment),
 and the negligent hiring, supervision, monitoring, and
 instruction of a State employee.
 
On April 12, 2012, after a July 18, 2011 bench trial,
 
the Circuit Court entered its Amended Judgment in favor of the
 defendants. Fraser appealed. 
On March 3, 2015, this court vacated the Amended
 
Judgment in part, concluding in part: 
[Under applicable supreme court cases,] the sentencing court
could exercise its discretion either way, by crediting or
not crediting a defendant with time previously served as a
condition of probation. . . . We conclude that if the
 sentencing court enters a judgment or order establishing the
amount of a defendant's credit for time served which the
 State believes is erroneous, the State cannot unilaterally
recalculate the credit for time served but must obtain an
 amended or corrected order from the sentencing court.
 
Fraser, 2015 WL 405689 at *3 (format altered). We rejected
 
Fraser's contention that the Mittimus Warrant was the same as an
 order or judgment and that extrinsic evidence must be excluded. 
We also rejected the State's argument that, as a matter of law,
 
8
 The main issue here is whether Fraser received the correct amount
 
of credit for time served in Cr. No. 05–1–0165. The other case, Cr. No. 05-1­
0580, is only relevant for the State's contention that the sentencing court
may have made a clerical error, applying the credit calculation from Cr. No.
05-1-0580 in Cr. No. 05-1-0165. 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Fraser was only entitled to credit for the 59 days he spent in
 
custody after his alleged probation violation and repeated that
 the State cannot unilaterally change a sentencing judge's
 determination based on the State's view of the appropriate
 credit. Noting that the Circuit Court had adopted and relied on
 the State's erroneous legal assumptions, we vacated the April 12,
 2012 Amended Judgment. Id. at *4. We emphasized:
 
Unfortunately, neither party focused on or presented
direct evidence on  the key question in this case — what the
sentencing judge had actually ordered with respect to credit
for time served in resentencing Fraser. Fraser and the
 State did not make a transcript of the sentencing judge's
resentencing hearing part of the record. They also did not
make any order or judgment signed by the sentencing judge
that reflected the judge's order regarding credit for time
served part of the record. Although the Mittimus Warrant
provided circumstantial evidence of what the sentencing
judge may have ordered with respect to credit for time
served, there were material issues of fact concerning what
the sentencing judge had actually ordered or intended to
order regarding credit for time served.
 
Id. (Emphasis added).
 
C. Proceedings on Remand
 
On May 20, 2016, Fraser filed a motion for summary
 
judgment, arguing that the court had given him 135 days of credit
 for time served, and therefore he should have been released on
 December 10, 2006. Fraser argued that the Department of Public
 Safety decided unilaterally that Fraser was only entitled to 59
 days of credit for time served. He stated that he was released
 on February 24, 2007, an over-detention of 76 days. Fraser
 attached the April 27, 2006 Mittimus Warrant to his Motion for
 Summary Judgment. The Mittimus Warrant stated that it was
 effective as of April 25, 2006, and that Fraser was sentenced to
 one year of incarceration with credit for 135 days of time
 served. The State filed an opposition, arguing that Fraser's
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
motion was essentially identical to his motion for summary
 
judgment in the proceedings prior to remand and did not address
 the issues on remand. On June 28, 2016, the Circuit Court
 entered the Order Denying Summary Judgment.
 
On June 21, 2016, Fraser filed his Motion in Limine to
 
Exclude any Extrinsic Evidence Outside of the Court Mittimus
 Filed on April 28, 2006 (Motion in Limine). Fraser argued that
 
the Mittimus Warrant was like a judgment or an order, and that
 
therefore it should be the only evidence admitted to show how
 much credit for time served he was to receive. In opposition,
 the State argued that the Motion in Limine was identical to the
 one that Fraser had submitted in the proceedings prior to the
 first appeal and that it did not address the issues on remand. 
The Circuit Court orally denied Fraser's Motion in Limine on the
 morning of trial, and entered its Order Denying Motion in Limine
 on July 26, 2016.
 
On July 1, 2016, the parties entered into Stipulations
 
as to Facts, which included, inter alia::
 
8.	 In CR. No. 05-1-0165, [Fraser] received a sentence of
one (1) year.
. . . . 
11.	 The Mittimus in CR No. 05-1-0165 states that [Fraser]
was to be credited with 135 days of time served. If
 135 days for time served had been credited,
Plaintiff's release date in CR No. 05-1-0165 would
 have been December 10, 2006.
12.	 [Fraser] was released on February 24, 2007 in CR No.
05-1-0165, serving time from February 27, 2006 through
February 24, 2007.
. . . .
 14.	 [Fraser] was released on March 18, 2005 for CR. No.
05-1-0165. 
15.	 [Fraser] was admitted again on April 7, 2005 for CR.
No. 05-1-0165. 
16.	 [Fraser] was released on probation for CR No. 05-1­
0165 on August 9, 2005.
. . . .

18.	 The file containing the transcript of the April 25,
2006 hearing, as recorded by the Court Reporter, is
corrupted and the transcript is irretrievable. 
On July 11, 2016, the Circuit Court held a bench trial. 
Prior to the testimony of the first witness, several exhibits
 
were received into evidence by stipulation, including a copy of
 the Mittimus Warrant, and a copy of a June 23, 2009 Order
 Revoking Probation and Resentencing Defendant (Resentencing
 
Order).
9 The Resentencing Order was signed by the judge who
 
presided over the April 25, 2006 resentencing hearing and stated,
 
in relevant part: 
Defendant is hereby placed on probation for five (5) years
commencing as of April 25, 2006, with the following terms
and conditions:
 
. . . .
 b. Defendant is hereby committed to the custody
of the Director of the Department of Public Safety for a
period of ONE (1) YEAR, and for the Resisting Arrest charge
of THIRTY (30) DAYS, credit for time served.
 
Fraser testified first and was the only witness on his
 
behalf. He testified as follows. Fraser was arrested and
 
admitted into custody on February 26, 2005, in connection with
 Cr. No. 05-1-0165 and released on March 18, 2005. He was again
 admitted into custody on April 27, 2005, in connection with Cr.
 No. 05-1-0165, and remained there until he was sentenced on
 August 9, 2005. On August 9, 2005, he was sentenced to 144 days
 of incarceration, the exact amount of time he had served, and he
 was released that day based on the credit given for time served. 
On February 23, 2006, he was re-arrested and re-admitted into
 custody, and remained there until his resentencing on April 25,
 2006, when he was resentenced to one year in jail. At that
 
9
 The Circuit Court also orally denied Fraser's Motion in Limine. 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
hearing, he was given credit for 135 days of time served in Cr.
 
No. 05-1-0165, and the release date should have been December 10,
 2006. Fraser was not released on December 10, 2006, and tried to
 contact his parents and his attorney at the time, but no one
 explained to him why he was still in custody. He was ultimately
 released from custody on February 24, 2007. Fraser then rested
 his case. 
Mirkovich testified for the State as follows. 
Mirkovich worked at the Maui Community Correctional Center, and
 at the time in question, she was a Sergeant. Her
 responsibilities included calculating the lengths of inmates'
 sentences. When she calculated Fraser's sentence on May 11,
 2006, she determined that Fraser was only entitled to 59 days of
 credit for time served under Cr. No. 05-1-0165, instead of the
 135 days indicated on the Mittimus Warrant. She then called the
 clerk of the sentencing judge and notified the clerk of the
 discrepancy. Mirkovich then recalculated the length of Fraser's
 sentence and arrived at a release date of February 24, 2007,
 which is when Fraser was released. The State presented no
 further witnesses.
 
After the presentation of evidence, the Circuit Court
 
ordered the parties to submit proposed findings of fact (FOFs)
 
and conclusions of law (COLs). 
On December 28, 2016, the Circuit Court entered its
 
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order, which included
 
the following:
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
II. FINDINGS OF FACT
 
. . . .
 
18. In her years of doing sentence computation,
Mirkovich has encountered instances where courts have given
an incorrect amount of presentence credit. When this has
 happened, MCCC's standard procedure is to call the court and
to notify the Department of Public Safety.
19. Mirkovich computed Plaintiff's sentences in May
2006, including his sentence in Criminal No. 05-1-0165.
20. Mirkovich noticed that the Mittimus in Criminal
 
No. 05-1-0165 indicated that Plaintiff had 135 days credit,
but he actually only had 59 days credit in that case.
21. After determining that Plaintiff had been given
an incorrect amount of presentence credit in Criminal No.
05-1-0165, Mirkovich called the sentencing judge's clerk and
notified her that Plaintiff had not spent 135 days in jail
from the time of the probation violation.
22. Mirkovich pointed out to the judge's clerk that
Plaintiff had 135 days credit in another one of his cases.
23. After speaking with the judge's clerk, Mirkovich
applied 59 days credit to Plaintiff's sentence in Criminal
No. 05-1-0165 and determined that his release date was
 
February 24, 2007.
. . . . 
II. 
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
 
. . . .
 
7. Plaintiff presented no evidence that he had been
in custody 135 days in Criminal No. 05-1-0165 when he was
resentenced to probation on April 25, 2006.
. . . . 
10. The Court finds the testimony of Mirkovich to be
credible and logical. Mirkovich, after discovering in
Criminal No. 05-1-0165 that the Mittimus had listed
 Plaintiff as having 135 days credit, and calculating that he
actually only had 59 days credit, called the judge's clerk
and notified her of this discrepancy. Mirkovich then
 applied 59 days of credit to Plaintiff's sentence in
Criminal No. 05-1-0165.
 
12. Plaintiff did not provide any order or judgment
signed by the sentencing judge that reflects the judge's
order regarding credit for time served in Criminal No.
05-1-0165. 
11. Plaintiff failed to prove that the sentencing
judge intended to credit him with all or part of the 144
days he served in 2005 in Criminal No. 05-1-0165.
. . . .
 13. Plaintiff has not proven by a preponderance of
the evidence the required elements for his negligence claim.
14. Plaintiff has not established what the State's
 
duty is, and has presented no evidence that the State
breached that duty.
15. Accordingly, that State did not breach its duty to
Plaintiff.
 
16. Plaintiff also failed to present any evidence to
substantiate the damages being claimed.
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On May 9, 2017, the Circuit Court entered the Judgment. 
On May 16, 2017, Fraser filed a Notice of Appeal.
 
II. POINTS OF ERROR
 
On appeal, Fraser asserts four points of error,
 
contending that the Circuit Court erred when it: (1) failed to
 recognize that Mirkovich could not unilaterally revise the
 calculation of Fraser's credit for time served; (2) found that
 Fraser presented no evidence that he had been in custody for 135
 days in relation to Cr. No. 05-1-0165; (3) denied the Motion in
 Limine, allowing evidence outside of the Mittimus Warrant in
 determining the appropriate amount of credit for time served; and
 (4) denying Fraser's Motion for Summary Judgment.
 III. APPLICABLE STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
"In this jurisdiction, a trial court's FOFs are subject 
to the clearly erroneous standard of review. An FOF is clearly erroneous when, despite evidence to support the finding, the appellate court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. Chun v. Bd. of Trs. of the 
Employees' Ret. Sys. of the State of Hawai' i, 106 Hawai' i 416, 
430, 106 P.3d 339, 353 (2005) (citations, internal quotation marks, and ellipses omitted). "An FOF is also clearly erroneous when the record lacks substantial evidence to support the finding. [The Hawai' i Supreme Court has] defined substantial 
evidence as credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion." Leslie v. Estate of Tavares, 91 Hawai' i 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
394, 399, 984 P.2d 1220, 1225 (1999) (citations and internal
 
quotation marks omitted). 
A COL is not binding upon an appellate court and is
freely reviewable for its correctness. [The appellate
court] ordinarily reviews COLs under the right/wrong
standard. Thus, a COL that is supported by the trial
court's FOFs and that reflects an application of the correct
rule of law will not be overturned. However, a COL that
presents mixed questions of fact and law is reviewed under
the clearly erroneous standard because the court's
conclusions are dependent upon the facts and circumstances
of each individual case.
 
Chun, 106 Hawai' i at 430, 106 P.3d at 353 (citation, internal 
quotation marks, and brackets omitted).
 
Because "the granting or denying of a motion in limine
 
is within the trial court's inherent power to exclude or admit
 
evidence, we review the court's ruling for the abuse of
 discretion standard." State v. Kealoha, 95 Hawai' i
  365, 379, 22 
P.3d 1012, 1026 (App. 2000) (citations, internal quotation marks,
 and brackets omitted). However, when the trial court's order
 granting a motion in limine is an evidentiary decision based upon
 relevance, the standard of review is the right/wrong standard. 
Ass'n of Apt. Owners of Wailea Elua v. Wailea Resort Co., Ltd.,
 100 Hawai' i 97, 110, 58 P.3d 608, 621 (2002). 
On appeal, the grant or denial of summary judgment is
reviewed de novo. [S]ummary judgment is appropriate if the
pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and
admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,
show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact
and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a
matter of law. A fact is material if proof of that fact
would have the effect of establishing or refuting one of the
essential elements of a cause of action or defense asserted
 
by the parties. The evidence must be viewed in the light
most favorable to the non-moving party. In other words, we
must view all of the evidence and inferences drawn therefrom
 in the light most favorable to the party opposing the
motion.

IV. DISCUSSION
 
A. The Revision of Fraser's Credit for Time Served
 Fraser argues that the trial court erred in failing to
 
recognize that Mirkovitch could not unilaterally revise the
 calculation of credit for time served. We agree. In Fraser's
 prior appeal, we held: 
[I]f the sentencing court enters a judgment or order
establishing the amount of a defendant's credit for time
served which the State believes is erroneous, the State
cannot unilaterally recalculate the credit for time served
but must obtain an amended or corrected order from the
 
sentencing court.
 
Fraser, 2015 WL 405689 at *3 (emphasis added). 
The Circuit Court clearly erred, inter alia, in FOF 20,
 
when it found that "Mirkovich noticed that Mittimus in Criminal
 
No. 05-1-0165 indicated that Plaintiff had 135 days credit, but
 he actually only had 59 days credit in that case." (Emphasis
 added). As we previously indicated, the latter portion of this
 finding reflects Mirkovich's judgment and determination, not that
 of the resentencing judge. Notwithstanding the State's
 opportunity to do so, the State presented no evidence that the
 resentencing court did not intentionally credit Fraser with same
 number of "days served" in both cases that were before the court
 on April 25, 2006. As we stated in our previous Memorandum
 Opinion, the Mittimus Warrant provided circumstantial evidence of
 what the sentencing judge ordered with respect to time served. 
In addition, the June 23, 2009 Resentencing Order stated that
 Fraser was still sentenced to five years of probation, but
 conditioned on a one-year period of incarceration – as opposed to
 the previous sentencing condition of 144 days of incarceration –
 
13
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
with credit for time served. The Resentencing Order did not
 
limit the "credit for time served" to time served from the time
 of the probation violation; it gave Fraser credit for "time
 served." Absent an order or any other evidence of the
 resentencing court's intent to the contrary, based on the
 evidence before the Circuit Court, we conclude that this order
 must be construed to have credited Fraser for all of the time he
 actually served on his sentence in Cr. No. 05-1-0165, not just a
 portion of it. Thus, the Circuit Court also erred in, inter
 alia, COLs 10-12, wherein the court found Mirkovich's testimony
 to be "credible and logical" and then relied on Mirkovich's
 testimony to interpret the resentencing judge's order. 
Regardless of Mirkovich's credibility, her testimony was
 irrelevant to the question of what the resentencing court ordered
 or intended regarding credit for time served.
 
B. Evidence that Fraser was Over-Detained
 Fraser next contends that the Circuit Court clearly
 
erred in finding that he failed to present evidence that he had
 been in custody for 135 days in Cr. No. 05-1-0165. We agree.
 
The parties stipulated that Fraser had been admitted
 
into custody on February 26, 2005, in Cr. No. 05-1-0165 and
 released on March 18, 2005, admitted again on April 7, 2005 for
 Cr. No. 05-1-0165 and released on August 9, 2005. Moreover, in
 the prior appeal, we noted that Fraser had been in custody for
 144 days when he was first sentenced on August 9, 2005, so this
 should not have been an issue on remand. See Fraser, 2015 WL
 
405689 at *1, n.3. The record lacks substantial evidence to
 
14
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
support COL 7, and therefore, it was clearly erroneous.10 See 
Leslie, 91 Hawai' i at 399, 984 P.2d at 1225. 
However, this error was harmless as to certain of 
Fraser's claims, because they fail for other reasons. A defect 
that is not inconsistent with substantial justice and does not affect the substantial rights of a party is harmless. See Bank 
of Hawaii v. Shinn, 120 Hawai' i 1, 20–21, 200 P.3d 370, 389–90 
(2008); Paglinawan v. Rompel, CAAP-11-0000426, 2013 WL 1131604 at *1 (Haw. App. Mar. 18, 2013) (mem. op.) (holding that an error was harmless where another ground existed for the court's ruling); see also Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 61. 
Fraser's claim that the State was liable under
 
respondeat superior for false imprisonment allegedly perpetrated
 by Read, is barred by sovereign immunity. See Doe Parents No. 1
 
v. State, Dep't of Educ., 100 Hawai' i 34, 68, 58 P.3d 545, 579 
(2002) (stating that claims for respondeat superior liability for false imprisonment are barred by sovereign immunity); Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 662-15(4) (2016) (sovereign immunity as 
to false imprisonment claims is not waived).
11 Therefore, the 
claim fails, regardless of the clear error in COL 7. 
10 Although labeled as a conclusion of law, we construe COL 7 to be a
finding of fact.

 HRS chapter 662 provides for the waiver of sovereign immunity for
certain tort claims against the State. HRS § 662-15(4) provides:
 
§ 662-15 Exceptions.  This chapter shall not apply to:
. . . .
 
(4)	 Any claim arising out of assault, battery, false
imprisonment, false arrest, malicious
prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander,
misrepresentation, deceit, or interference with
contract rights;

In the First Amended Complaint, Fraser also alleged 
that the State was liable for negligently hiring, supervising, 
monitoring, and instruction of Read. This claim is not necessarily barred by sovereign immunity. See Doe Parents No. 1, 
100 Hawai' i at 68, 58 P.3d at 579 ("if the State knew, or 
reasonably should have anticipated, that one of its employees would commit an intentional tort against a person to whom the State owed a duty of care, the State is liable for the negligence of those employees who were in a position to take reasonable precautions against the anticipated harm" (emphasis added)). However, no evidence was adduced at trial to show that Read failed to take reasonable precautions against Fraser's false imprisonment. Read did not testify at trial, and little evidence was adduced as to Read at all, except for his title and that Mirkovich spoke with him. It appears that Fraser abandoned this claim, and therefore it fails, regardless of the clear error in COL 7. 
However, Fraser also alleged negligence and respondeat
 
superior liability for the negligence of State employees in
 failing to release him from custody on the appropriate date. 
With respect to Fraser's negligence claims, the Circuit Court
 concluded in COL 14 that Fraser failed to establish the State's
 duty. However, as Fraser alleged in the First Amended Complaint,
 the State had a duty to ensure that he was released from custody
 on the appropriate date, consistent with the court's orders. 
Based on the above, we conclude that the Circuit Court erred in 
16

COLs 14 and 15 when it concluded that the State did not breach
 
its duty to Fraser. 
C. The Motion in Limine
 Fraser maintains that the Circuit Court abused its
 
discretion in denying his Motion in Limine and allowing evidence
 outside of the Mittimus Warrant in determining the appropriate
 amount of credit for time served. This argument is without
 merit. The basis for the Motion in Limine was Fraser's
 assumption that the Mittimus Warrant was equivalent to a judgment
 or an order. However, as we previously stated in Fraser, 2015 WL
 405689 at *3, a mittimus warrant is signed by a court clerk, not
 a judge. As we previously held, "[e]vidence of what the Circuit
 Court had ordered or intended to order with respect to credit for
 time served and whether Fraser was legally entitled to any such
 credit were relevant to Fraser's negligence claim against the
 State." Fraser, 2015 WL 405689 at *4.
 
D. Summary Judgment
 Finally, Fraser again contends that the Circuit Court
 
erred in denying summary judgment because the Mittimus Warrant,
 which stated that Fraser was to be credited for 135 days of time
 served, was not disputed. This argument is without merit. As we
 held when Fraser previously made this argument, although the
 Mittimus Warrant provided circumstantial evidence of what the
 resentencing judge ordered, Fraser was not entitled to judgment
 as a matter of law based on the Mittimus Warrant. See Fraser,
 
2015 WL 405689 at *4. Therefore, the Circuit Court properly
 denied Fraser's May 20, 2016 motion for summary judgment.

V. CONCLUSION
 
As stated above, the Circuit Court's May 9, 2017
 
Judgment is affirmed in part and vacated in part; this case is
 
remanded to the Circuit Court for further proceedings consistent
 with this Memorandum Opinion.
