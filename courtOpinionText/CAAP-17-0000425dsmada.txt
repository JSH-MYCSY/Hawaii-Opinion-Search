APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 12-1-0118)NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
ORDER GRANTING THE JULY 17, 2017
MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
Upon review of (1) Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/
Appellee Bank of America, N.A., Successor by Merger to BAC Home
Loans Servicing, LP, fka Countrywide Home Loans Servicing, LP's
(Bank of America), July 17, 2017 motion to dismiss appellate
court case number CAAP-17-0000425 for lack of appellate
jurisdiction, (2) Appellant James Hall's (Hall) August 7, 2017
memorandum in opposition to Bank of America's July 17, 2017
motion to dismiss, (3) Bank of America's court-authorized August
18, 2017 reply memorandum in support of its July 17, 2017 motion,
and (4) the record, it appears that Hall was a non-party in the
underlying foreclosure case in Civil No. 12-1-0118-01 who lacks
standing to assert an appeal in appellate court case number CAAP-
17-0000425.
Hall is appealing from the Honorable Bert I. Ayabe's
April 20, 2017 judgment on a decree of foreclosure, which was an
immediately appealable judgment under Hawaii Revised Statutes
(HRS) § 667-51(a) (2016).  Hall's status as a non-party raises
the issue of standing in his appeal.
Generally, the requirements of standing to appeal are: (1)
the person must first have been a party to the action ; (2)
the person seeking modification of the order or judgment
must have had standing to oppose it in the trial court; and
(3) such person must be aggrieved by the ruling, i.e., the
person must be one who is affected or prejudiced by the
appealable order.
Abaya v. Mantell, 112 Hawai# i 176, 181, 145 P.3d 719, 724 (2006)
(citation, internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted;
emphasis in original).  "In other words, non-parties, who did not
or could not intervene, are ordinarily denied standing to
appeal."  Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted;
emphasis in original).  Thus, for example, where an appellant had
asserted an appeal from a case in which the appellant had never
formally intervened pursuant to Rule 24 of the Hawai #i Rules of
Civil Procedure (HRCP), the Supreme Court of Hawai #i held that,
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
"because Appellant was not made a party to the instant case, it
lacks standing to appeal[,]" and the Supreme Court of Hawai #i
"dismiss[ed] Appellant's appeal."  Abaya v. Mantell , 112 Hawai #i
at 184, 145 P.3d at 727.
Similarly in the instant case, no parties in Civil No.
12-1-0118-01 named Hall as a defendant in any of their multiple
claims.  While Hall, on February 26, 2013, filed an HRCP Rule 24
motion to intervene in Civil No. 12-1-0118-01, and under the
collateral order doctrine, "[a]n order denying an application for
intervention under HRCP Rule 24 is a final appealable order under
HRS § 641–1(a)," Hoopai v. Civil Service Commission , 106 Hawai‘i
205, 215, 103 P.3d 365, 375 (2004) (citation omitted), the
circuit court never entered any written order granting or denying
Appellant Hall's HRCP Rule 24 motion to intervene, because
Appellant Hall withdrew his motion.  See February 27, 2013
Circuit Court Minutes ("MR. HALL ORALLY WITHDREW HIS MOTION TO
INTERVENE.").  Consequently, Hall did not seek a ruling on his
motion to intervene, and he did not intervene as party in Civil 
No. 12-1-0118-01 pursuant to HRCP Rule 24.  
The subject property was owned by Cary Thornton
(Thornton), Hall's friend and neighbor, who died during the
course of the foreclosure action.  A special administrator was
appointed by the probate court to represent Thornton's estate
with respect to the subject property, and the special
administrator was substituted for Thornton in the underlying
foreclosure action.  Hall's claim of standing to appeal is based
on the same contentions he raised in a related appeal challenging
the probate court's denial of his motion to remove the special
administrator of Thornton's estate.  However, in the related
appeal, we recently concluded that Hall had not established that
he was an interested person with respect to Thornton's estate,
and we affirmed the probate court's denial of Hall's motion to
remove the special administrator.  In re Estate of Thornton , No.
CAAP-16-669 (Oct. 31, 2017). 
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Because Hall withdrew his motion to intervene and
because he has not shown that he has an interest in the subject
property or is authorized to represent Thornton's estate, we
conclude that Halll lacks standing to assert an appeal.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Bank of America's
July 17, 2017 motion to dismiss appellate court case number 
CAAP-17-0000425 for lack of appellate jurisdiction is granted,
and appellate court case number CAAP-17-0000425 is dismissed.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are
denied as moot.
