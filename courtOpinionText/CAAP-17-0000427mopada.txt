OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
JAMES THOMPSON, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 97-0-2401)
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Reifurth and Chan, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant James Thompson (Thompson) appeals
 
from the "Judgment of Conviction and Sentence" (Judgment) entered
 
on April 28, 2017 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
 
(Circuit Court).1
 
After Thompson was convicted, initially sentenced, and 
exhausted his state court appeals, he filed a "Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus" in the United States District Court for the District of Hawai' i (U.S. District Court), which ordered that 
Thompson be resentenced. The Circuit Court resentenced Thompson on the multiple counts for which he was convicted, and he now appeals from the new sentence. 
In this appeal, Thompson contends that the Circuit
 
Court: (1) erred in failing to require Plaintiff-Appellee State

 The Honorable Sherri L. Iha presided.

of Hawai' i (State) to prove beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury 
that the factors set forth in Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 
§ 706-606 (2014) supported consecutive rather than concurrent
 
sentences;2 (2) violated HRS § 706-609 (2014)3 and Thompson's
 
constitutional right to due process by sentencing him to more
 severe sentences after his original sentence was set aside on
 collateral attack; and (3) erred in granting the State's "Motion
 
2 HRS § 706-668.5 (1993) provides:
 
[§706-668.5] Multiple sentence of imprisonment. (1) If
multiple terms of imprisonment are imposed on a defendant at the
same time, or if a term of imprisonment is imposed on a defendant
who is already subject to an unexpired term of imprisonment, the
terms may run concurrently or consecutively. Multiple terms of
imprisonment imposed at the same time run concurrently unless the
court orders or the statute mandates that the terms run
 consecutively. Multiple terms of imprisonment imposed at
different times run consecutively unless the court orders that the
terms run concurrently.
(2) The court, in determining whether the terms imposed are
to be ordered to run concurrently or consecutively, shall consider
the factors set forth in section 706-606.
 
In turn, HRS § 706-606 provides:
 
§706-606 Factors to be considered in imposing a sentence.
The court, in determining the particular sentence to be imposed,
shall consider:
 
(1) The nature and circumstances of the offense and the 
history and characteristics of the defendant;
(2)	 The need for the sentence imposed:
(a) To reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote
respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the
offense;
(b) To afford adequate deterrence to criminal
conduct;
(c) To protect the public from further crimes of the
defendant; and
(d) To provide the defendant with needed
educational or vocational training, medical care, or other
correctional treatment in the most effective manner;
(3	 The kinds of sentences available; and
(4)	 The need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities
among defendants with similar records who have been
found guilty of similar conduct.

 HRS § 706-609 provides: 
§706-609 Restentence for the same offense or for offense
 
based on the same conduct not to be more severe than prior
sentence. When a conviction or sentence is set aside on direct or
 
collateral attack, the court shall not impose a new sentence for
the same offense, or for a different offense based on the same
conduct, which is more severe than the prior sentence.

for Consecutive Term" because the original sentencing judge4 had
 
previously denied a motion for consecutive term. 
For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.
 
I. Background
 
On October 1, 1997, Thompson was indicted on twenty-
four counts for alleged offenses against four different minor
 
victims. On October 27, 2000, a jury found Thompson guilty on
 twenty counts, as follows:
 
• With regard to Victim 1:
 
• Counts 1-4 and 6 (each involving Sexual Assault in 
the First Degree in violation of HRS § 707-730(1)(a)
 (1993))
 • Counts 7-8 (each involving Attempted Sexual Assault
 in the First Degree in violation of HRS §§ 705-500
 (2014) and 707-730(1)(a))
 • Counts 9-11 (each involving Sexual Assault in the
 Third Degree in violation of HRS § 707-732(1)(e)
 (1993)) 
• Count 12 (Kidnapping in violation of HRS § 707­720(1)(d) (1993))
 
• With regard to Victim 2:
 
• Count 13 (Sexual Assault in the Fourth Degree in
 violation of HRS § 707-733(1)(b) (1993))
 
• With regard to Victim 3:
 
• Count 14 (Sexual Assault in the First Degree)
 • Counts 15-17 (each involving Sexual Assault in the
 Third Degree)
 
• With regard to Victim 4:
 
• Count 19 (Sexual Assault in the First Degree)
 • Counts 20 - 21 (each involving Sexual Assault in the
 Third Degree)
 • Count 22 (Kidnapping)

 The Honorable Dexter D. Del Rosario presided over Thompson's original
sentencing.

   NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On November 1, 2000, following Thompson's conviction,
 
the State filed a "Motion for Extended Term" and a "Motion for
 
Consecutive Term." On January 10, 2001, the Circuit Court
 entered its "Judgment Guilty Conviction and Sentence" pursuant to
 the jury's verdict. 
On January 16, 2001, after a hearing before the
 
sentencing judge, the State's "Motion for Extended Term" was
 granted. The following day, the Circuit Court entered "Findings
 of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting State's Motion for
 Extended Term," sentencing Thompson as follows: life imprisonment
 with the possibility of parole for Counts 1-4, 6-8, 14, and 19; 
twenty years for Counts 12 and 22; and ten years for Counts 9-11,
 15-17, 20, and 21. Having sentenced Thompson to multiple life
 sentences, the Circuit Court also concluded that consecutive
 terms were not necessary and denied the State's "Motion for
 Consecutive Term[s]." 
On May 13, 2008, Thompson challenged his sentence by
 
filing a writ of habeas corpus in the U.S. District Court. An
 amended petition was filed on June 14, 2012. 
On August 29, 2012 the U.S. District Court held that
 
Thompson's extended term sentence was contrary to Apprendi v. New
 Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000) and entered an order granting in part
 Thompson's writ of habeas corpus and setting aside Thompson's
 original sentence.
5
 
On December 2, 2014, Thompson filed his "Motion to
 
Enforce Order Granting in Part Petition of Writ for Habeas
 Corpus" in the Circuit Court. On June 5, 2015, the State filed a
 new "Motion for Consecutive Term." 
After a hearing on April 7, 2017,
6 Thompson was
 
resentenced as follows:

 On March 18, 2014, the order of the U.S. District Court was affirmed
by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Thompson v. Thomas, 564 Fed. Appx.
316, 2014 WL 1017044 (9th. Cir. 2014) (Mem.).

 The resentencing hearing was repeatedly continued by agreement of the
parties in order to negotiate a possible plea deal. Following Thompson's June
20, 2016 "Memorandum of Law in Opposition to the State's Motion for
Consecutive Sentencing," another series of continuances resulted in the
eventual April 7, 2017 date.

   NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
•	 Twenty years for: Counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 14, and 19
 
(each involving Sexual Assault in the First
 Degree); 
•	 Twenty years for: Counts 7 and 8 (each involving
 Attempted Sexual Assault in the First Degree);
 
•	 Five years for: Counts 9, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17, 20,
 and 21 (each involving Sexual Assault in the Third
 Degree); 
•	 Ten years for: Counts 12 and 22 (each involving
 Kidnapping); and
 
•	 One year for: Count 13 (involving Sexual Assault
 in the Fourth Degree).
 
The Circuit Court ordered: Counts 1-4 and 6-12 (each
 
related to Victim 1) to run concurrently with each other; Count
 13 (related to Victim 2) to run consecutively with Counts 1-4 and
 6-12; Counts 14-17 (related to Victim 3) to run concurrently with
 each other but consecutively with Counts 1-4 and 6-13; and Counts
 19-22 (related to Victim 4) to run concurrently with each other,
 but consecutively with Counts 1-4 and 6-17. In total, Thompson
 was sentenced to serve sixty-one years of imprisonment. In
 resentencing Thompson, the Circuit Court stated:
 
THE COURT: Now, the reasoning for this is that the
consecutive sentencing for the four separate complaining witnesses
needs to reflect the seriousness of the offenses and promote
respect for the law and to provide just punishment for these
offenses. These girls have had their innocence and their ability
to feel safe in their community stolen from them at a very
young age, and it has seriously impacted the rest of their lives.
 
It's also to afford adequate deterrence to further criminal
conduct. The defendant was remorseful after he committed each of
 these offenses and yet continued to prey on young women. 
And it's also to protect the public from further crimes of
the defendant. 
The Circuit Court also resentenced Thompson to complete the Sex
 
Offender Treatment Program or any other appropriate educational
 or vocational programs while incarcerated, and gave Thompson
 credit for time served.

II. Standard of Review
 
We review the Circuit Court's resentencing of Thompson
 
under an abuse of discretion standard:
 
[a] sentencing judge generally has broad discretion in
imposing a sentence. The applicable standard of review for
sentencing or resentencing matters is whether the court
committed plain and manifest abuse of discretion in its
decision. Factors that indicate a plain and manifest abuse
of discretion are arbitrary or capricious actions by the
judge and a rigid refusal to consider the defendant's
contentions. In general, to constitute an abuse it must
appear that the court clearly exceeded the bounds of reason
or disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the
substantial detriment of a party litigant.

(internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets omitted). 
Furthermore, "[i]nterpretation of a statute is a 
question of law which we review de novo." Kikuchi v. Brown, 110 
Hawai'i 204, 207, 130 P.3d 1069, 1072 (App. 2006) (internal 
quotation marks and citation omitted). 
Finally, "[w]e answer questions of constitutional law 
by exercising our own independent constitutional judgment based 
on the facts of the case. Thus, we review questions of constitutional law under the right/wrong standard." State v. 
Pratt, 127 Hawai' i 206, 212, 277 P.3d 300, 306 (2012) (citations 
and internal quotation marks omitted).
III. No Apprendi Violation in Imposing Consecutive Sentences
 
Thompson contends the Circuit Court erred by failing to 
require the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury 
that the factors set forth in HRS § 706-606 supported consecutive rather than concurrent sentences. Although the United States Supreme Court in Oregon v. Ice, 555 U.S. 160, 67-68 (2009) and the Hawai' i Supreme Court in State v. Kahapea, 111 Hawai' i 267, 
279-80, 141 P.3d 440, 452-53 (2006) have previously held that Apprendi does not apply to the determination of consecutive sentences, Thompson argues the issue should be revisited in light of Alleyne v. United States, 570 U.S. 99 (2013) and State v. Auld, 136 Hawai' i 244, 361 P.3d 471 (2015). For reasons set 
forth below, we disagree. 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In Apprendi, the U.S. Supreme Court held that "[o]ther
 
than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the
 
penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must
 be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt." 
530 U.S. at 490. In Ice, decided nine years after Apprendi, the
 U.S. Supreme Court recognized that the decision to impose
 sentences consecutively or concurrently was not traditionally a
 function of the jury. 555 U.S. at 168. The U.S. Supreme Court
 also recognized that most states followed the common law
 tradition of entrusting judges with unfettered discretion in
 deciding whether to impose concurrent or consecutive sentences. 
Id. at 163. The U.S. Supreme Court thus held that judicial
 findings of facts to impose consecutive rather than concurrent
 sentences was consistent with Apprendi and findings by a jury was
 not required. Id. at 169-72. 
In Alleyne, the U.S. Supreme Court held that any fact
 
that increased the mandatory minimum sentence was an element that
 must be submitted to the jury. 570 U.S. at 103. As the court
 explained, "facts increasing the legally prescribed floor
 aggravate the punishment." Id. at 113. However, the court also
 
noted that: 
[i]n holding that facts that increase mandatory minimum
sentences must be submitted to the jury, we take care to
note what our holding does not entail. Our ruling today
does not mean that any fact that influences judicial
discretion must be found by a jury. We have long recognized
that broad sentencing discretion, informed by judicial
factfinding, does not violate the Sixth Amendment. 
Id. at 116 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).
 
Therefore, Alleyne is consistent with Ice and does not
 
affect judicial factfinding for sentencing discretion in the
 
imposition of concurrent or consecutive sentences. 
Following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Alleyne, 
the Hawai' i Supreme Court in State v. Auld examined the Apprendi 
"fact of prior conviction" exception. 136 Hawai' i at 247-48, 
252-54, 361 P.3d at 474-75, 479-81. The court in Auld held that, as a matter of state law, the Apprendi exception does not apply 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to mandatory minimum sentencing of repeat offenders under HRS
 
§ 706–606.5. Id. at 254, 361 P.3d at 481. The court instead
 
held that a defendant is entitled to have a jury find beyond a
 reasonable doubt that his or her prior convictions trigger the
 imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence as a repeat offender
 under HRS § 706–606.5. Id. at 254, 361 P.3d at 481. The instant
 
case is distinguishable from Auld, because Auld did not address
 the issue of judicial factfinding under HRS § 706-606 related to
 consecutive sentencing.
 
The Hawai' i Supreme Court has also previously held that 
Apprendi does not apply to a sentencing judge's factfinding to impose consecutive sentences under HRS § 706-668.5, which entails consideration of the factors set forth in HRS § 706-606. See 
Kahapea, 111 Hawai' i at 278-80, 141 P.3d at 451-53 (dismissing 
the proposition that Apprendi proscribes factfinding for consecutive sentencing by a trial judge). While consecutive sentences lengthen incarceration beyond the statutory maximum for one individual sentence, none of the individual terms of imprisonment themselves exceed the statutory maximum, and thus the circuit court has discretion under HRS § 706-668.5 to impose consecutive sentences. Id. at 279, 141 P.3d at 452. The Hawai' i 
Supreme Court concluded that pursuant to HRS §§ 706-660 and 706­668.5, terms running consecutively for multiple sentences is the statutory maximum. Id. at 279-80, 141 P.3d at 452-53. 
Similarly, Thompson's three consecutive twenty-year
 
sentences enhanced his term of imprisonment beyond the twenty
 year statutory maximum for one count of sexual assault in the
 first degree. See HRS §§ 707-730(1)(a) (1993)
7, 706-659 (Supp.
 
7
 At the time of Thompson's indictment in 1997, HRS § 707-730 read as
follows:
 
§707-730 Sexual assault in the first degree. (1) A person
commits the offense of sexual assault in the first degree if:
(a)	 The person knowingly subjects another person to
an act of sexual penetration by strong compulsion[.]
 . . . .
  
(continued...)
 
8
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
1994)8. However, none of Thompson's individual terms of
 
imprisonment exceeded the statutory maximum. Therefore,
 
Thompson's consecutive terms of imprisonment did not deprive him
 
of his constitutional right to a trial by jury.
 
We conclude that (1) neither the U.S. Supreme Court 
decision in Alleyne nor the Hawai' i Supreme Court decision in 
Auld are applicable in the instant case; and (2) the circumstances of the instant case are consistent with Ice and Kahapea. Accordingly, we rest upon Ice and Kahapea in concluding that Thompson's consecutive sentence was properly imposed based upon facts found by the sentencing judge and is therefore not a violation of Apprendi. 
IV.	 No Imposition of a More Severe Sentence After Collateral
Attack
 
Thompson contends he was subjected to a more severe
 
sentence after his original sentence was set aside on collateral
 
attack in violation of HRS § 706-609 and his constitutional due
 process rights. For reasons set forth below, we disagree. 
HRS § 706-609 provides, "[w]hen a conviction or
 
sentence is set aside on direct or collateral attack, the court
 shall not impose a new sentence for the same offense, or for a
 different offense based on the same conduct, which is more severe
 than the prior sentence." Thompson's original sentence consisted
 of nine life terms with the possibility of parole, two twenty-
year sentences, eight ten-year sentences, and one one-year
 sentence to run concurrently with each other. After
 resentencing, Thompson's sentence consists of three twenty-year
 
(...continued)
(2) Sexual assault in the first degree is a class A felony.
 
8
 HRS § 706-659 read in pertinent part as follows: 
§706-659 Sentence of imprisonment for class A felony.  . . .
 
a person who has been convicted of a class A felony, except class
A felonies defined in chapter 712, part IV, shall be sentenced to
an indeterminate term of imprisonment of twenty years without the
possibility of suspension of sentence or probation[.] 
9
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
sentences and one one-year sentence to run consecutively pursuant
 
to HRS § 706-668.5 and the remaining sentences to run
 concurrently, for an aggregate of sixty-one years of
 imprisonment. 
"HRS § 706-609 prevents a sentencing court from issuing 
a more severe sentence after the initial sentence has been set aside upon review." Keawe v. State, 79 Hawai' i 281, 289, 901 
P.2d 481, 489 (1995); see also State v. Mara, 102 Hawai' i 346, 
368, 76 P.3d 589, 611 (App. 2003) (holding that a collateral attack on a judgment is a proceeding separate from the original action). Here, Thompson's original sentence was set aside on collateral attack after the U.S. District Court granted his petition for writ of habeas corpus. Therefore, the relevant consideration is whether ordering terms of imprisonment consecutively is more severe than concurrent life terms.  
To determine whether a new sentence is more severe 
under HRS § 706-609, we must evaluate each individual sentence as well as the aggregate sentence. State v. Canosa, No. CAAP-16­
0000497, 2018 WL 1889511, at *3-4 (Hawai' i App. Apr. 20, 2018) 
(holding it is a violation of HRS § 706-609 if the imposition of consecutive terms for a defendant's sentence increases the maximum possible imprisonment). Here, Thompson's resentencing resulted in less severe or equal sentences for each of his individual sentences. Furthermore, the maximum possible term of imprisonment for Thompson under his original sentence was life imprisonment, which was decreased to sixty-one years after resentencing. 
We disagree with Thompson's argument that his current
 
sentence of sixty-one years of imprisonment is more severe than
 his original sentence of life imprisonment. See Martin v.
 
Kaiser, 907 F.2d 931, 936 (10th Cir. 1990) (concluding that
 nothing on its face except the death penalty can be more severe
 than a life sentence because what may seem like a sentence that
 exceeds a person's expected life span will terminate upon the
 death of the prisoner and cannot extend longer than a life
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
sentence). Thus, although sixty-one years is a considerable
 
length of time, it is not "more severe" than a life term, and in
 this regard the Circuit Court did not violate HRS § 706-609 or
 Thompson's constitutional due process rights.
V.	 Thompson's Consecutive Sentences Not Precluded By Law of the
Case
 
Thompson contends that the Circuit Court was precluded
 
from imposing consecutive sentences under the law of the case
 
doctrine because the original sentencing judge had imposed
 concurrent, not consecutive, sentences. Given the circumstances
 of this case, we disagree.
 
The law of the case doctrine is "the usual practice of 
courts to refuse to disturb all prior rulings in a particular case, including rulings made by the judge himself [or herself]." Wong v. City & Cty. of Honolulu, 66 Haw. 389, 396, 665 P.2d 157, 162 (1983). Furthermore, "unless cogent reasons support the second court's action, any modification of a prior ruling of another court of equal and concurrent jurisdiction will be deemed an abuse of discretion." Id. (citations omitted); see also 
Stender v. Vincent, 92 Hawai' i 355, 362, 992 P.2d 50, 57 (2000) 
(concluding the law of the case doctrine "does not preclude modification of prior rulings in all instances"). A change in facts supporting a particular ruling can rise to the level of a "cogent reason" justifying an overturning of the ruling. State 
v. Oughterson, 99 Hawai' i 244, 254, 54 P.3d 415, 425 (2002) 
(citing State v. Mabuti, 72 Haw. 106, 807 P.2d 1264 (1991)). 
Here, the original sentencing judge concluded that
 
consecutive terms were not necessary because Thompson had
 received multiple life sentences. When the life sentences were
 set aside, it resulted in a change of fact that affected
 Thompson's resentencing that the original sentencing judge did
 not consider. 
Furthermore, after an issuance of a writ of habeas 
corpus, the Circuit Court had jurisdiction to resentence Thompson de novo.  State v. Keck, Nos. 29530, 29531, 2010 WL 4491240, at 
*1 (Hawai' i App. Nov. 10, 2010) (SDO) provides: 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
[t]he issuance of a writ of habeas corpus results in
invalidation (in whole or in part) of the judgment
authorizing the prisoner's confinement. Where a court
 issues a writ based on a constitutional error, the remedy
should put the defendant back in the position he would have
been in if the constitutional violation never occurred. 
After the federal court grants a writ, the State may seek a
new judgment (through a new trial or a new sentencing
proceeding).
 
(Emphasis in original) (citations and internal quotation marks
 
omitted). Therefore, the Circuit Court was not bound by the
 decisions of the original sentencing judge, and exercised its
 discretion within the bounds permitted under the sentencing
 statutes to sentence Thompson to consecutive terms. 
Based on the foregoing, we conclude the Circuit Court
 
was not precluded by the law of the case and there were cogent
 reasons to support granting consecutive terms during
 resentencing.
VI. Conclusion
 
Based on the above, we affirm the Circuit Court of the
 
First Circuit's "Judgment of Conviction and Sentence" entered on
