STATE OF HAWAII, Plaintiff-Appellee, 
v.
LOUIS WILLIAMS, also known as Louis Edwards Williams, 
Defendant-Appellant#
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CR. NO. 16-1-1654)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, and Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Louis Williams, also known as Louis
Edwards Williams, was convicted by a jury on two counts of
Assault in the Third Degree pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes
("HRS") section 707-712(1)(a)1/ following an altercation between
Williams and his two roommates, Aliyah Bayliss and John Kasman. 
Williams appeals from the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence
entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit ("Circuit
Court")2/ on May 8, 2017.  The Circuit Court sentenced Williams
1/The statute provides, in relevant part, that
(1) A person commits the offense of assault in the third
degree if the person:
(a) Intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causes
bodily injury to another person[.]
Haw. Rev. Stat. ยง 707-712(1)(a) (2014).
2/The Honorable Christine E. Kuriyama.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
to thirty-days imprisonment with credit for time served and one-
year probation.
On appeal, Williams contends that the Circuit Court
erred when it (1) ruled that the Plaintiff-Appellee State of
Hawai#i had made out a prima facie case for Assault in the Third
Degree as to the alleged assault against Kasman in response to
Williams' first motion for judgment of acquittal,3
/ and (2)
denied Williams' second motion for judgment of acquittal.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments they advance and the issues they raise, as well as
the relevant statutory and case law, we affirm.
(1) In his first point of error, Williams asserts that
because Kasman was unavailable to appear during the trial, the
State had failed to present evidence to support a finding or
conclusion by the trier of fact that Kasman felt pain after he
was sprayed by Williams with what was alleged to be pepper spray. 
Specifically, Williams argues that because Kasman did not take
the stand to testify about the pain he suffered at the hands of
Williams "[n]o one is qualified to read Mr. [Kasman's] thoughts
whether or not he's actually feeling pain."  The Circuit Court
denied Williams' motion, stating, "Based on the physical
descriptions provided by the State's witnesses, the jury can
determine did Mr. [Kasman] feel pain, or did he not feel pain?
It's not up to the Court to decide. It's up to the jury to
decide."
According to Williams, the State needed to: (1) produce
the bottle of pepper spray that it said was used by Williams; (2)
have that liquid tested to confirm that it is in fact pepper
spray; and (3) call an expert to the stand to authenticate the
contents of the bottle and to testify that spraying that liquid
on a person will cause pain to the sprayed person.  We disagree. 
3/Count 1 of the Complaint charged Williams with assault upon
Bayliss, while Count 2 charged Williams with assault upon Kasman.  Williams'
opening brief confusingly describes the first point of error as being with
respect to "both counts," but proceeds then to describe the point of error as
relating to Count 2 only, and addresses only that second count in the argument
section.  Thus, we treat Williams' first point as relating only to Count 2.
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
To prove Assault in the Third Degree, the State need not prove
the use of a particular instrument, but only (1) that the
defendant caused bodily injury to another person and (2) that the
defendant did so intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly.  See
Haw. Rev. Stat. ยง 707-712(1)(a) (2014).
"Bodily injury" is defined as "physical pain, illness,
or any impairment of physical condition."  Haw. Rev. Stat. ยง 707-
700 (2014).  A plain reading of HRS sections 707-712 and 707-700,
with specific emphasis on HRS section 707-712(1)(a), does not
reveal or suggest that for a defendant to be convicted of Assault
in the Third Degree, the State must prove what caused bodily
injury to the complaining witness, or that the only way for the
State to prove that a defendant caused bodily injury to another
is by having that person testify themselves as to the pain they
felt.  See  State v. King, 139 Hawai# i 249, 253, 386 P.3d 886, 890
(2016) (citing State v. Alangcas, 134 Hawai# i 515, 525, 345 P.3d
181, 191 (2015)) ("[S]tatutory construction begins with an
examination of the plain language in order to determine and give
effect to the legislative intent and purpose underlying the
statute.").  Accordingly, the statute does not require
identification of the substance used, but rather, whether that
substance caused bodily injury to the victim.  The State was
therefore not required to prove that the unknown spray was in
fact pepper spray.4/
The next issue is whether the State proved beyond a
reasonable doubt that Williams caused bodily injury to Kasman,
regardless of the substance that he used.  On appeal, this
becomes a question of whether there was substantial evidence to
support Williams' conviction.  State v. Maldonado, 108 Hawai #i
436, 442, 121 P.3d 901, 907 (2005) (citation omitted).  As such,
we review the evidence in the strongest light for the
prosecution.  State v. Pone, 78 Hawai# i 262, 265, 892 P.2d 455,
458 (1995).
4/Nonetheless, Williams' admitted to having pepper spray in his
pocket and to having sprayed Kasman with it during the incident.
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
Proof of bodily injury to Kasman was made more
difficult by the fact that Kasman died before he could testify at
trial.  It is well-settled, however, that "guilt may be proved
beyond a reasonable doubt on the basis of reasonable inferences
drawn from circumstantial evidence[,]" Pone, 78 Hawai# i at 273,
892 P.2d at 466 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting State
v. Simpson , 64 Haw. 363, 373 n.7, 641 P.2d 320, 326 n.7 (1982)),
and that the State may resort to such evidence when the
complaining witness is deceased.  Cf. State v. Kekona, 120
Hawai#i 420, 438-41, 209 P.3d 1234, 1252-55 (App. 2009)
(discussing cases in which it was appropriate to admit
circumstantial evidence of a deceased victim).
In this case, Bayliss and Heather MacGregor, the
parties' landlord, testified that, in the midst of an argument
between Bayliss and Williams, Williams responded by spraying
Bayliss in the face with a mace-like or pepper-spray-like
substance, that her eyes "burned intensely" and "hurt" from the
spray, and that he subsequently sprayed Kasman with the same
substance.  MacGregor corroborated Bayliss' testimony, describing
both Kasman's and Bayliss' reactions to being sprayed by Williams
as "miserable."  Aaron Bullock, a tenant who lived in the same
residence as Williams, Bayliss, Kasman, and MacGregor, likewise
testified that he assumed the substance used on Bayliss and
Kasman was pepper spray based on their reactions to getting
sprayed. 
The jury, "as trier of fact . . . is free to make all
reasonable and rational inferences under the facts in evidence,
including circumstantial evidence."  Pone , 78 Hawai #i at 265, 892
P.2d at 458 (quoting  State v. Batson , 73 Haw. 236, 249, 831 P.2d
924, 931 (1992)).  An inference is "a logical and reasonable
conclusion of the existence of a fact . . . from the
establishment of other facts[,] from which, by the process of
logic and reason, and based upon human experience, the existence
of the assumed fact may be concluded by the trier of fact." 
Pone, 78 Hawai# i at 273, 892 P.2d 455 at 466 (emphasis and
ellipsis in original) (quoting State v. Emmsley , 3 Haw. App. 459,
464-65, 652 P.2d 1148, 1153 (1982)).  "[I]t is well-settled that
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
an appellate court will not pass upon issues dependent upon the
credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence; this is
the province of the [trier of fact]."  State v. Stocker , 90
Hawai#i 85, 90, 976 P.2d 399, 404 (1999) (brackets in original)
(quoting State v. Buch, 83 Hawai# i 308, 321, 926 P.2d 599, 612
(1996)).
Furthermore, this court has stated that bodily injury
may be established by lay testimony as long as the lay witness
had a "suitable opportunity for observation": 
evidence of bodily injury may be established by lay testimony
which is rationally based on the perception of the witness.
HRE Rule 701; cf. Cozine v. Hawaiian Catamaran, Ltd. , 49 Haw.
77, 113, 412 P.2d 669, 691 ("The general rule is that a
nonexpert witness who has had suitable opportunity for
observation may state inferences from transient physical
appearances, as that a person was in pain and suffering,"
where all the facts cannot be placed before the jury and the
inference is not one requiring "special skill, knowledge and
experience[.]"), reh'g denied , 49 Haw. 267, 414 P.2d 428
(1966).
State v. Tanielu, 82 Hawai# i 373, 379, 922 P.2d 986, 992 (App.
1996).
The standard employed by the appellate courts in
reviewing the trial court's grant or denial of a motion for
judgment of acquittal is "whether, upon the evidence viewed in
the light most favorable to the prosecution and in full
recognition of the province of the trier of fact, a reasonable
mind might fairly conclude guilt beyond a reasonable doubt." 
State v. Hicks , 113 Hawai #i 60, 69, 148 P.3d 493, 502 (2006)
(quoting Maldonado , 108 Hawai #i at 442, 121 P.3d at 907).
Here, upon the evidence presented by Bayliss, Bullock
and MacGregor, viewed in the light most favorable to the
prosecution, and in full recognition of the province of the trier
of fact, a reasonable juror could fairly conclude that Kasman
felt pain after Williams sprayed him in the face with what was
alleged to be pepper spray.  See Hicks, 113 Hawai# i at 69, 148
P.3d at 502; Pone , 78 Hawai #i at 265, 273, 892 P.2d 455 at 458,
466 (citations omitted) (recognizing that "guilt may be proved
beyond a reasonable doubt on the basis of reasonable inferences
drawn from circumstantial evidence" (quoting Simpson, 64 Haw. at
373 n.7, 641 P.2d at 326 n.7) and that the jury "as trier of fact
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
. . . is free to make all reasonable and rational inferences
under the facts in evidence, including circumstantial evidence."
(quoting Batson, 73 Haw. at 249, 831 P.2d at 931); Tanielu, 82
Hawai#i at 379, 922 P.2d at 992 ("[E]vidence of bodily injury may
be established by lay testimony which is rationally based on the
perception of the witness." (citing Hawai #i Rules of Evidence
Rule 701); State v. Mattiello, 90 Hawai# i 255, 259, 978 P.2d 693,
697 (1999) ("[I]t is well-settled that an appellate court will
not pass upon issues dependent upon the credibility of witnesses
and the weight of the evidence; this is the province of the
[trier of fact]." (quoting Stocker, 90 Hawai# i at 90, 976 P.2d at
404 (brackets in original)).
Accordingly, the record demonstrates that Williams
intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly caused "bodily injury" to
Kasman within the meaning of HRS section 707-712(1)(a), and the
State proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Williams committed
the offense of Assault in the Third Degree against Kasman. 
Therefore, the Circuit Court did not err in denying Williams'
first motion for judgment of acquittal as to Count 2.
(2) In his second point of error with regard to the
Circuit Court's denial of his second motion for judgment of
aquittal, Williams renews his argument that the State "need[ed]
to produce at trial the actual pepper spray that was used or to
produce testimony by someone who can say that he/she seized the
spray, tested the spray, can confirm the spray at issue was in
fact pepper spray, and that pepper spray causes bodily injury of
the type the leiglature sought to criminalize under HRS [section]
707-712(1)(a), when it is sprayed on someone."  Because those
issues were addressed above, and because Williams does not
contest the sufficiency of the evidence as it relates to Bayliss
(Count 1) in particular, there is nothing further for our
consideration.
Therefore, the Circuit Court did not err in ruling that
the State made out a prima facie case that Williams committed the
offense of Assault in the Third Degree against Bayliss and Kasman
within the meaning of HRS section 707-712(1)(a), and Williams'
second point is without merit.  See Pone , 78 Hawai #i at 273, 892

P.2d 455 at 466; Mattiello , 90 Hawai #i at 259, 978 P.2d at 697.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the May 8, 2017
Judgment of Conviction and Sentence entered by the Circuit Court
of the First Circuit is affirmed.
