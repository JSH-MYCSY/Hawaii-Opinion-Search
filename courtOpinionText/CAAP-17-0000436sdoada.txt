(CIVIL NO. 13-1-1114(1))
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Ginoza, C.J., Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
Defendants-Appellants Shelley Alene St John,
Individually and as Trustee in for the Temple of Peace Trust aNOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Private Constructive Irrevocable Trust Declared Herein in the
Care of Kevin St John and Shelley St John (the  Trust), and Kevin
Francis St John, as Trustee of the Trust (collectively the St
Johns) appeal from the Judgment entered on May 4, 2017, by the
Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (circuit court ).1  The St
Johns also challenge the underlying "Findings of Fact,
Conclusions of Law and Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for
Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure Against All Parties
and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure" ( Order Granting
Summary Judgment ) entered on May 4, 2017.  The Judgment and Order
Granting Summary Judgment were entered against the St Johns and
in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee The Bank of New York Mellon FKA
The Bank of New York, as Trustee for the Certificateholders of
CWMBS, Inc., CHL Mortgage Pass-Through Trust 2006-3, Mortgage
Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2006-3 ( Bank of New York
Mellon).
On appeal, the St Johns contend that the circuit court
erred in granting summary judgment because Bank of New York
Mellon failed to present any admissible evidence that it was in
possession of the original promissory note at the time the
Complaint was filed and thus, did not establish its standing in
this foreclosure action.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
well as the relevant legal authorities, we resolve the St Johns'
point of error as follows, and we vacate and remand.
The Hawai #i Supreme Court's opinion in Bank of America,
N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai# i 361, 390 P.3d 1248 (2017) is
dispositive in this appeal.  In Reyes-Toledo , the supreme court
held in a judicial foreclosure action that in order to establish
a right to foreclose, the foreclosing plaintiff must establish
standing, or entitlement to enforce the subject note, at the time
the action was commenced.  Id.  at 367-70, 390 P.3d at 1254-57.
1  The Honorable Rhonda I.L. Loo presided.
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Reyes-Toledo notes that a foreclosing plaintiff must
typically "prove the existence of an agreement, the terms of the
agreement, a default by the mortgagor under the terms of the
agreement, and giving of the cancellation notice."  Id.  at 367,
390 P.3d at 1254 (citing  Bank of Honolulu, N.A. v. Anderson , 3
Haw. App. 545, 551, 654 P.2d 1370, 1375 (1982)).  Furthermore,
"[a] foreclosing plaintiff must also prove its entitlement to
enforce the note and mortgage."  Id.  The supreme court then
expressed that "[a] foreclosing plaintiff's burden to prove
entitlement to enforce the note overlaps with the requirements of
standing in foreclosure actions as 'standing is concerned with
whether the parties have the right to bring suit.'"  Id.
(brackets omitted) (quoting  Mottl v. Miyahira, 95 Hawai# i 381,
388, 23 P.3d 716, 723 (2001)).  Because "standing relates to the
invocation of the court's jurisdiction, it is not surprising that
standing must be present at the commencement of the case."  Id.
at 368, 390 P.3d at 1255.  Thus, a foreclosing plaintiff must
establish entitlement to enforce the note and standing to
foreclose on the mortgaged property at the commencement of the
suit.  Id.
Similar to the plaintiff bank in Reyes-Toledo , in this
case Bank of New York Mellon was granted a decree of foreclosure
via a summary judgment ruling.  Bank of New York Mellon filed its
Verified Complaint for Foreclosure ( Verified Complaint) on
December 26, 2013, which asserted that "Plaintiff is entitled to
enforce the Note and is the record assignee of the Mortgage."
Attached to the Verified Complaint is a Verification of Complaint
for Foreclosure ( Verification) executed by Suzette Figer (Figer )
on December 9, 2013.  Figer attests, inter alia, that she is
employed by Resurgent Capital Services, LP ( Resurgent Capital),
"the loan servicing agent for Plaintiff[,]" and that a true and
correct copy of the Adjustable Rate Note (Note), which is
endorsed in blank, is attached as Exhibit "A".  The copy of the
Note attached to Figer's Verification indicates a promise to
repay the lender and that the lender was Countrywide Home Loans,
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Inc. (Countrywide ).  Figer's Verification also attests that
"Plaintiff is in possession of the Note."  Thus, Figer's
Verification attests that Bank of New York Mellon was in
possession of the blank endorsed Note at the time the Verified
Complaint was filed.
However, under  U.S. Bank N.A. v. Mattos , 140 Hawai #i
26, 398 P.3d 615 (2017) and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Behrendt,
142 Hawai #i 37, 414 P.3d 89 (2018), Figer's Verification does not
satisfy the requirements for admitting the Note under the Hawaii
Rules of Evidence ( HRE) Rule 803(b)(6) business records
exception.  Figer does not attest that she is the custodian of
the Note (or the other documents attached to her Verification),
and thus must be a "qualified witness" to establish the
requirements for admissibility.  Mattos, 140 Hawai #i at 30-32,
398 P.3d at 619-21; Behrendt, 142 Hawai #i at 45-46, 414 P.3d at
97-98; HRE Rule 803(b)(6).
Under Mattos and Behrendt , Figer's Verification does
not establish that she is a qualified witness.  As discussed in
Behrendt:
the court in Mattos held that a witness may be qualified to
provide the testimony required by HRE Rule 803(b)(6) even if
the witness is not employed by the business that created the
document or lacks direct, personal knowledge of how the
document was created.  Id.  "There is no requirement that
the records have been prepared by the entity that has
custody of them, as long as they were created in the regular
course of some entity's business."  Id. (quoting 
State v.
Fitzwater, 122 Hawai #i 354, 366, 227 P.3d 520, 532 (2010)).
The witness, however, must have 
enough familiarity with the
record-keeping system of the business that created the
record to explain how the record was generated in the
ordinary course of business.  Id.
Records received from another business and incorporated into
the receiving business' records may in some circumstances be
regarded as "created" by the receiving business.  Id.
Incorporated records are admissible under HRE Rule 803(b)(6)
when a custodian or qualified witness testifies that the
documents were incorporated and kept in the normal course of
business, that the incorporating business typically relies
upon the accuracy of the contents of the documents, and the
circumstances otherwise indicate the trustworthiness of the
document.  See id.; Fitzwater, 122 Hawai #i at 367-68, 227
P.3d at 533-34.
142 Hawai# i at 45-46, 414 P.3d at 97-98.  Figer's Verification
states, in pertinent part:
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
1.  I have knowledge of and I am competent to testify
to the matters stated herein by virtue of my employment for
Resurgent Capital Services, LP the loan servicing agent for
Plaintiff THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON FKA THE BANK OF NEW
YORK,[] AS TRUSTEE FOR THE CERTIFICATEHOLDERS OF CWMBS,
INC., CHL MORTGAGE PASS-THROUGH TRUST 2006-3, MORTGAGE PASS-
THROUGH CERTIFICATES, SERIES 2006-3 ("Plaintiff").  I have
been trained to use and understand the record keeping system
utilized for this loan.  I know that pursuant to normal
business practices, the entries in the business records are
made at or near the time of the occurrence by the person
with actual knowledge of the occurrence being recorded in
the business record.  I have also been trained to use and
understand the entries in the record and am familiar with
the same.  My knowledge is based on my review of the
business records and files related to the mortgage loan
which is the subject of this foreclosure. 
2.  On or about December 7, 2005, Defendant SHELLY ST
JOHN ("Borrower"), for value received, duly made, executed
and delivered to Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., a promissory
note ("Note") in the amount of $536,000.00.  A true and
correct copy of the Indorsed Note is attached as Exhibit
"A."  I confirmed that Borrower is the proper defendant in
this action.
. . . 
5.  Plaintiff is in possession of the Note.  As evidenced by
the recorded Mortgage and applicable assignments, Plaintiff is
also the record assignee of the Mortgage.  As such, Plaintiff is
the proper plaintiff in this matter.
. . .
9.  All documents, memoranda, reports and records of data
compilation (collectively, "Records of Acts") that are attached as
Exhibits "A" - "E" to my Verification, as well as all other
factual information contained herein, represent records of
regularly conducted business activity relating to the subject
loan. 
10.  The Records of Acts were and are made in the course of
Plaintiff's and Plaintiff's servicing agent's regularly conducted
business activity of mortgage lending and mortgage servicing. 
11.  All herein referenced Records of Acts were and are made
at or near the time of the acts reported.  Entries into these
records are made by persons having personal knowledge of such
event, and are reviewed by me from time to time to ensure accuracy
and completeness, and are relied upon by Plaintiff and its
servicing agent in the conduct of its business
. 
12.  I am familiar with the referenced Records of Acts,
which is used to record and track events and documents by
Plaintiff and its servicing agent that are relevant to this loan. 
These records are routinely made in the ordinary course of
business in a filing and computer system that I have access to,
have been trained to use and understand, and with which I am
familiar. 
13.  I reviewed the Verified Complaint for Foreclosure
prepared by RCO Hawaii, LLLC, including the attached exhibits and
I have confirmed the factual accuracy of the allegations set forth
therein.
(Emphasis added).
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Figer does not attest that she is familiar with the
record-keeping system of the business that created the Note,
apparently Countrywide, so that she can explain how the Note was
generated in the ordinary course of its business.  Figer also
does not attest that the Note or other documents attached to her
Verification were incorporated into Resurgent Capital's records
and kept in the normal course of business, that Resurgent Capital
relies on the accuracy of the contents of the documents, and
circumstances that otherwise indicate trustworthiness of the
documents.  We note that paragraph 10 of Figer's Verification
states that the documents attached thereto "were and are made in
the course of Plaintiff's and Plaintiff's servicing agent's
regularly conducted business activity[,]" which does not appear
to be correct given that the lender for the Note was Countrywide
and the blank endorsement on the Note was executed by a Managing
Director of Countrywide. 
In sum, there is no admissible evidence in the record
to establish Bank of New York Mellon's entitlement to enforce the
Note when this action was commenced.2  Specifically, there is no
admissible evidence establishing that Bank of New York Mellon was
in possession of the blank endorsed Note at the time the
Complaint was filed.
Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the
St Johns, as we must for purposes of a summary judgment ruling,
there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Bank of
New York Mellon had standing when this foreclosure action was
commenced.  Pursuant to Reyes-Toledo, the circuit court thus
2 Bank of New York Mellon submitted an Affirmation of Attorney on
October 2, 2014, the same day that its summary judgment motion was filed,
which stated in part that the Complaint contained no false statements of fact.
However, an attorney affirmation does not establish a lender's entitlement to
enforce a note.  See U.S. Bank Tr., N.A. v. Busto, CAAP-16-0000334, 2017 WL
2579070, at *2 (Hawai #i App. Jun. 14, 2017) (SDO) (Ginoza, J., dissenting, on
grounds that a majority of this court disregarded a similar attorney
affirmation filed pursuant to HRS § 667-17); Wilmington Sav. Fund Soc'y v.
Yasuda
, CAAP-17-0000433, 2018 WL 1904909, at *6 (Hawai #i App. Apr. 23, 2018)
(SDO) (Ginoza, J., concurring, based on Behrendt, 142 Hawai #i 37, 414 P.3d 89,
wherein the Hawai #i Supreme Court did not give any evidentiary merit to the
attorney affirmation in that case).
