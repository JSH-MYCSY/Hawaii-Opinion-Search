JOSHUA W. PANTKE, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
(NORTH & SOUTH KONA DIVISION)
(CASE NO. 3DTA-16-02229)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Joshua W. Pantke (Pantke) appeals
from the Amended Judgment and Notice of Entry of Amended Judgment
(Amended Judgment ) entered in the District Court of the Third
Circuit, North and South Kona Division ( District Court ) on April
25, 2017.1  
On August 9, 2016, Plaintiff-Appellee, the State of
Hawai#i (State), charged Pantke by complaint with, inter alia : 
(1) Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant
(OVUII) in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS ) § 291E-
1The Honorable Margaret K. Masunaga presided.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
61(a) (Supp. 2017);2 and (2) Inattention to Driving, in violation
of HRS § 291-12 (Supp. 2015).3  After a two-day bench trial,
Pantke was convicted of OVUII and Inattention to Driving.  Pantke
timely filed a notice of appeal.
On appeal, Pantke raises two points of error,
contending that the District Court erred in:  (1) failing to
obtain Pantke’s "knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver of his
constitutional rights to testify and not to testify because the
[colloquies] were defective under Tachibana ;" and (2) admitting
the testimony of Officer Alexis Molina regarding Pantke's
performance on the horizontal gaze nystagmus test.  
Upon careful review of the record on appeal and the
briefs submitted by the parties, and having given due
consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised, as
2HRS § 291E-61(a) provides:
§ 291E-61  Operating a vehicle under the influence of
an intoxicant.   (a) A person commits the offense of
operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if
the person operates or assumes actual physical control of a
vehicle:
(1) While under the influence of alcohol in an
amount sufficient to impair the person's normal
mental faculties or ability to care for the
person and guard against casualty;
(2) While under the influence of any drug that
impairs the person's ability to operate the
vehicle in a careful and prudent manner;
(3) With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two
hundred ten liters of breath; or
(4) With .08 or more grams of alcohol per one
hundred milliliters or cubic centimeters of
blood.
3HRS § 291-12 states in relevant part:
§ 291-12 Inattention to driving.   Whoever operates any
vehicle without due care or in a manner as to cause a
collision with, or injury or damage to, as the case may be,
any person, vehicle or other property shall be fined not
more than $500 or imprisoned not more than thirty days, or
both, and may be subject to a surcharge of up to $100 which
shall be deposited into the trauma system special fund.
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Pantke's
points of error as follows:
The validity of a criminal defendant's waiver of the
right to testify is a question of constitutional law reviewed by
this court under the right/wrong standard.  State v.
Gomez-Lobato, 130 Hawai #i 465, 468-69, 312 P.3d 897, 900-901
(2013); see also State v. Eduwensuyi , 141 Hawai #i 328, ___ , 409
P.3d 732, 736 (2018) (in the context of Tachibana  violations).  
However, "once a violation of the constitutional right to
testify is established, the conviction must be vacated
unless the State can prove that the violation was harmless
beyond a reasonable doubt." . . . "The relevant question
under the harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standard is
'whether there is a reasonable possibility that error might
have contributed to conviction.'"  
State v. Chong Hung Han, 130 Hawai #i 83, 93, 306 P.3d 128, 138
(2013) (citations omitted).  
Pantke first contends that the ultimate Tachibana
colloquy in this case was incomplete because it advised Pantke
that he had the right "to remain silent" rather than the right
"not to testify."  In conducting a Tachibana  colloquy, the court
must advise the defendant that:  
he [or she] has a right to testify, that if he [or she]
wants to testify that no one can prevent him [or her] from
doing so, [and] that if he [or she] testifies the
prosecution will be allowed to cross-examine him [or her].
In connection with the privilege against self-incrimination,
the defendant should also be advised that he [or she] has a
right not to testify and that if he [or she] does not
testify then the jury can be instructed about that right.
Tachibana v. State, 79 Hawai# i 226, 236, n.7, 900 P.2d 1293,
1303, n.7, (1995). 
In Chong Hung Han, the supreme court stated that the
phrase "right to remain silent" did not satisfy Tachibana:  
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Finally, the court should advise a defendant that he or she
has the right not to testify.  Tachibana, 79 Hawai #i at 235,
900 P.2d at 1303. Here, the court told Petitioner that he
had "the constitutional right to remain silent[,]" and said
nothing about the right not to testify.  However, for a
defendant, "remaining silent" could mean something other
than "not testifying," since the phrase "right to remain
silent" popularly invokes the familiar Miranda warnings. As
Chief Justice Rehnquist noted in his opinion in 
Dickerson v.
United States, "Miranda has become embedded in routine
police practice to a point where the warnings have become
part of our national culture." 530 U.S. 428, 430, 120 S.Ct.
2326, 147 L.Ed.2d 405 (2000). A defendant could be confused
if a court states simply, "you have the right to remain
silent" without using the accompanying phrase, "you have the
right not to testify."
Chong Hung Han , 130 Hawai #i at 93, n.8, 306 P.3d at 138, n.8.   
Here, in its ultimate colloquy, the District Court
stated: 
THE COURT: Okay. I just need to give you some
advisement of rights.
You have a right to testify. If you want to
testify, no one can prevent you from testifying. If you
choose to testify, the prosecutor can cross examine you. If
you choose not to testify, the court cannot hold that
against you, and you do have the right to remain silent . You
understand? 
(Emphasis added).  Therefore, under Chong Hung Han , the District
Court's ultimate colloquy was deficient.4
Pantke next contends that the District Court erred
because it did not obtain an on-the-record waiver from Pantke
regarding his right to testify or not to testify.  "[I]n order to
protect the right to testify under the Hawai #i Constitution,
trial courts must advise criminal defendants of their right to
testify and must obtain an on-the-record waiver of that right in
4Although the District Court stated "[i]f you choose not to
testify, the court cannot hold that against you," the court did not directly
inform Pantke of his right not to testify.  In State v. Celestine,
SCWC-14-0000335, 2018 WL 1754118 at *8 (Haw. Apr. 12, 2018) at *8, the Hawai #i
Supreme Court recently underscored that part of the first component of a
Tachibana colloquy is informing the defendant that he or she has a right not
to testify.  Because this error here, however, was in failing to properly
advise Pantke of his right not to testify, and Pantke did not testify, the
error appears to be harmless.  See, e.g.
, State v. Dykas, No. CAAP-17-0000352,
2018 WL 852202 (Haw. App. Feb. 14, 2018)(SDO), as amended, (Haw. App. Feb. 28,
2018).

every case in which the defendant does not testify."  Tachibana ,
79 Hawai# i at 236, 900 P.2d at 1303.  
Here, the District Court gave multiple colloquies and
each time asked Pantke if he understood; but it did not once ask
Pantke whether or not he wanted to testify, and not once did
Pantke indicate on the record whether or not he wanted to
testify.  To constitute an on-the-record waiver, the defendant
must state whether or not he or she will testify.  See State v.
Staley, 91 Hawai #i 275, 286-87, 982 P.2d 904, 915-16 (1999); 
State v. Hoang, 94 Hawai# i 271, 278, 12 P.3d 371, 378 (App.
2000).  Accordingly, the District Court failed to obtain an on-
the-record waiver from Pantke as required by Tachibana .
Pantke further contends that the District Court
delivered the ultimate Tachibana colloquy too early, and not at
the close of Pantke's case.  In Tachibana , the supreme court
noted that "the ultimate colloquy should be conducted after all
evidence other than the defendant's testimony has been received." 
Tachibana, 79 Hawai# i at 237, n.9, 900 P.2d at 1304, n.9.
Additionally, the supreme court would later hold: 
Implicit in our holding in Tachibana was our conclusion that
a defendant must be afforded the opportunity to not decide
whether to take the stand until the close of the defense's
case.  An exception that effectively waives the defendant's
constitutional right to testify or not to testify based on a
preliminary decision, made before the defense's case was
presented, would be inconsistent with the principles
enunciated in Tachibana.
State v. Loher , 140 Hawai #i 205, 218, 398 P.3d 794, 807 (2017).   
Here, a defense witness testified after the ultimate
colloquy was given.  Therefore, pursuant to Loher, the District
Court erred in giving the ultimate colloquy too early.
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Finally, as there is nothing to indicate what Pantke
would have said if he had testified, we cannot conclude that the
District Court's error constituted harmless error beyond a
reasonable doubt.  See State v. Pomroy , 132 Hawai #i 85, 94, 319
P.3d 1093, 1102 (2014); Hoang, 94 Hawai #i at 279, 12 P.3d at 379.
In light of the above, we need not reach Pantke's
second point of error.
The District Court's April 25, 2017 Amended Judgment is
vacated and this case is remanded for a new trial.
