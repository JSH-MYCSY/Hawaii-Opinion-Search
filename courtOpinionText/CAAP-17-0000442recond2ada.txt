APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 13-1-3006)
ORDER DENYING MAY 17, 2018 "PLAINTIFFS'-APPELLANTS'
MOTION OBJECTIONS TO COURT FILED ON MAY 9, 2018 WHICH
PLAINTIFFS-APPELLANTS RECEIVED ON MAY 13, 2018"
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
Upon review of (1) the March 8, 2018 order dismissing
this appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction,(2) the March 28,
2018 order denying Plaintiffs-Appellants Scarlett A. Taylor and
Chanel E. Taylor's (the Taylors) March 22, 2018 motion for
reconsideration of the March 8, 2018 order of dismissal pursuant
to Rule 40 of the Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP),
(3) the April 25, 2018 order denying the Taylors' April 18, 2018
"MOTION OBJECTION [SIC] DENYING ORDER FILED MARCH 28, 2018 THAT
PLAINTIFFS RECEIVED ON APRIL 10, 2018," which we deemed to be a
second and unauthorized HRAP Rule 40 motion for reconsideration
of the March 8, 2018 order of dismissal, (4) the May 9, 2018
order denying the Taylors' May 4, 18, 2018 "MOTION OBJECTION
[SIC] TO COURT'S FILED APRIL 25, 2018," which we deemed to be aNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
third and unauthorized HRAP Rule 40 motion for reconsideration of
the March 8, 2018 order of dismissal, (5) the Taylors' most
recent May 17, 2018 "PLAINTIFFS'-APPELLANTS' MOTION OBJECTIONS
[SIC] TO COURT FILED ON MAY 9, 2018 WHICH PLAINTIFFS-APPELLANTS
RECEIVED ON May 13, 2018," which we deem to be a fourth and
unauthorized HRAP Rule 40 motion for reconsideration of the 
March 8, 2018 order of dismissal, and (6) the record, it appears
that, although the title of the Taylors' May 17, 2018 motion
refers to the May 9, 2018 order, the Taylors actually seek, for
the fourth time, to invoke HRAP Rule 40 for reconsideration of
the March 8, 2018 dismissal order that terminated this appeal
more than two months ago.  HRAP Rule 40 does not authorize
multiple motions for reconsideration of an order of dismissal.  
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Taylors'
May 17, 2018 HRAP Rule 40 motion for reconsideration of the
March 8, 2018 order of dismissal is denied.
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that the Taylors shall
cease filing motions in appellate court case number 
CAAP-17-0000442, which has concluded.  If the Taylors file
further motions in this appeal, they may be subject to sanctions
as set forth in HRAP Rule 51.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, May 23, 2018.
