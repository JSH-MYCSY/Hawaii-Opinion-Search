APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 13-1-3006)
ORDER DENYING MAY 4, 2018 "MOTION
OBJECTION TO COURT'S FILED APRIL 25, 2018"
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
Upon review of (1) the March 8, 2018 order dismissing
this appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction,(2) the March 28,
2018 order denying Plaintiffs-Appellants Scarlett A. Taylor and
Chanel E. Taylor's (the Taylors) March 22, 2018 motion for
reconsideration of the March 8, 2018 order of dismissal pursuant
to Rule 40 of the Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP),
(3) the April 25, 2018 order denying the Taylors' April 18, 2018
"MOTION OBJECTION DENYING ORDER FILED MARCH 28, 2018 THAT
PLAINTIFFS RECEIVED ON APRIL 10,2018," which we deemed to be a
second and unauthorized HRAP Rule 40 motion for reconsideration
of the March 8, 2018 order of dismissal, (4) the Taylors' most NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
recent May 4, 2018 "MOTION OBJECTION TO COURT'S FILED APRIL 25,
2018," which we deem to be a third and unauthorized HRAP Rule 40
motion for reconsideration of the March 8, 2018 order of
dismissal and (5) the record, it appears that, although the title
of the Taylors' May 4, 2018 motion refers to the April 25, 2018
order, the Taylors actually seek, for the third time, to invoke
HRAP Rule 40 for reconsideration of the March 8, 2018 dismissal
order that terminated this appeal two months ago.  HRAP Rule 40
does not authorize multiple motions for reconsideration of an
order of dismissal. 
Therefore, the Taylors' May 4, 2018 HRAP Rule 40 motion
for reconsideration of the March 8, 2018 order of dismissal is
denied.
