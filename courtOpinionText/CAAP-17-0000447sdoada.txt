SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Chan, JJ.)
In this judicial foreclosure action, we construe
Defendant-Appellant Oliver H. Cummings, Jr.'s (Cummings ) appeal
as challenging a Judgment entered pursuant to an "Order
Confirming Foreclosure Sale, Approving Commissioner's Report,
Allowance of Commissioner's Fees, Attorneys' Fees, Costs,NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Directing Conveyance and for Writ of Ejectment", both filed by
the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit ( Circuit Court)  on June
7, 2017, in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee U.S. Bank Trust, N.A., as
Trustee for LSF9 Master Participation Trust ( U.S. Bank ). 
Cummings also challenges an "Order Granting Commissioner's Motion
for Leave to Sell Property Without Open Houses and for
Instructions Filed on December 14, 2016" filed by the Circuit
Court on May 26, 2017.21
On appeal,  Cummings asserts that he denies the
jurisdiction of the Circuit Court and this court regarding the
matters in this case under the laws of the Kingdom of Hawai#i. 
He thus contends that this case should be dismissed.3
In State v. Kaulia, 128 Hawai#i 479, 291 P.3d 377
(2013), the defendant contested the jurisdiction of the courts of
the State of Hawai#i, claiming the existence of the Hawaiian
Kingdom and that he was immune from the jurisdiction of the state
courts.  Id. at 486-87, 291 P.3d at 384-85.  The Hawai#i Supreme
1  The Honorable Peter T. Cahill presided.
2  Cummings' Notice of Appeal was filed, pro se, on May 30, 2017, after
the Circuit Court verbally announced, on May 3, 2017, that it would be
granting U.S. Bank's motion to confirm the sale of the foreclosed property,
but before the Circuit Court entered the Judgment confirming the sale on June
7, 2017. See Hawai#i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 4(a)(2) ("If a notice
of appeal is filed after announcement of a decision but before entry of the
judgment or order, such notice shall be considered as filed immediately after
the time the judgment or order becomes final for the purpose of appeal.").
3  The Notice of Appeal was signed by Cummings and indicates he is
appearing pro se.  The Civil Appeal Docketing Statement filed on June 1, 2017,
lists Nelson K. Armitage as "Counsel for Appellants."  The Jurisdictional
Statement filed for Cummings on August 4, 2017, is unsigned but states that it
is submitted by Nelson K. Armitage Sr., Wayne Armitage, Jim Kimmel, and
Russell Kahookele.  The Certificate of Service for the Jurisdictional
Statement is signed by Cummings and Nelson K. Armitage Sr.  The Opening Brief
for Cummings, filed on October 12, 2017, is unsigned but contains at the end
the name of Nelson K. Armitage Sr., and the Certificate of Service for the
Opening Brief is signed by Cummings and Nelson K. Armitage Sr.  Given the
above, we note with regard to Nelson K. Armitage Sr., Wayne Armitage, Jim
Kimmel, and Russell Kahookele that "natural persons are not permitted to act
as 'attorneys' and represent other natural persons in [t]heir causes."  Oahu
Plumbing & Sheet Metal, Ltd. v. Kona Const., Inc., 60 Haw. 372, 377, 590 P.2d
570, 573-74 (1979) (citing Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) §§ 605-2 and 605-14
(1976)).  HRS § 605-17 (2016) provides that: "Any person violating sections
605-14 to 605-16 shall be guilty of a misdemeanor."

Court ruled that "we reaffirm that '[w]hatever may be said
regarding the lawfulness' of its origins, 'the State of Hawai#i .
. . is now, a lawful government.'"  Id. at 487, 291 P.3d at 385
(quoting State v. Fergerstrom, 106 Hawai#i 43, 55, 101 P.3d 652,
664 (App. 2004), aff'd, 106 Hawai# i 41, 101 P.3d 225 (2004)).
THEREFORE, we affirm the Judgment and "Order Confirming
Foreclosure Sale, Approving Commissioner's Report, Allowance of
Commissioner's Fees, Attorneys' Fees, Costs, Directing Conveyance
and for Writ of Ejectment", both entered on June 7, 2017, as well
as the "Order Granting Commissioner's Motion for Leave to Sell
Property Without Open Houses and for Instructions Filed on
December 14, 2016", entered on May 26, 2017, all by the Circuit
Court of the Second Circuit.
