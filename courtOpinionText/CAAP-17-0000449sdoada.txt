STATE OF HAWAI #I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
MICHAEL W. OVERBY, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
NORTH AND SOUTH HILO DIVISION
(CASE NO. 3DCW-16-0002640)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Chan, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Michael W. Overby (Overby) appeals
from the Judgment and Notice of Entry of Judgment, entered on
May 3, 2017, in the District Court of the Third Circuit, North
and South Hilo Division.1
Overby was convicted of Harassment, in violation of
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 711-1106(1)(b)(f) (2014).
On appeal, Overby contends the District Court erred by
failing to conduct the so-called "ultimate colloquy" required by
Tachibana v. State, 79 Hawai# i 226, 900 P.2d 1293 (1995), thereby
violating his constitutional right to testify.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve Overby's point of error as follows:
Overby contends that the District Court plainly erred
by failing to conduct the Tachibana colloquy and the error was
not harmless.  The State concedes the District Court did not

conduct this colloquy and cannot rebut the presumption of a
constitutional violation of Overby's right to testify.  However,
the State, citing State v. Taylor, 130 Hawai #i 196, 205, 307 P.3d
1142, 1151 (2013), State v. Silva , 78 Hawai #i 115, 890 P.2d 702
(App. 1995), and LaVinge v. State, 812 P.2d 217 (Alaska 1991),
claims a two-step plain error analysis requires the defendant to
demonstrate a reasonable possibility that the error contributed
to his conviction and come forward with an affidavit identifying
what relevant testimony would have been presented at trial.
"[I]n order to protect the right to testify under the
Hawai#i Constitution, trial courts must advise criminal
defendants of their right to testify and must obtain an on-the-
record waiver of that right in every case in which the defendant
does not testify."  Tachibana , 79 Hawai #i at 236, 900 P.2d at
1303.  Overby did not testify.  The District Court did not
conduct an ultimate colloquy required by Tachibana .  The failure
to conduct an ultimate colloquy alone is sufficient to conclude
that Overby's right to testify was violated.  Tachibana , 79
Hawai#i at 237-38, 900 P.2d at 1304-05, State v. Pomroy , 132
Hawai#i 85, 92, 319 P.3d 1093, 1100 (2014) (the court need not
determine whether the prior-to-trial Tachibana colloquy was
sufficient when the ultimate Tachibana colloquy is defective).
The State's arguments regarding the plain error
analysis applicable to the ultimate Tachibana colloquy are
without merit.  In Pomroy, the Hawai #i Supreme Court affirmed its
holding in Tachibana , that "Once a violation of the
constitutional right to testify is established, the conviction
must be vacated unless the State can prove that the violation was
harmless beyond a reasonable doubt."  Pomroy , 132 Hawai #i at 94,
319 P.3d at 1102 (quoting Tachibana , 79 Hawai #i at 240, 900 P.2d
at 1307).  In State v. Joseph , 141 Hawai #i 128, 405 P.3d 654,
No. CAAP-16-0000715, 2017 WL 4838116 at *1 (App. Oct. 26, 2017)
(mem.), cert. denied , SCWC-16-0000715, 2018 WL 1063888 (Feb. 27,
2018), this court rejected the State's argument that a defendant
must demonstrate a reasonable possibility that the error
contributed to his conviction and come forward with an affidavit
of what relevant testimony would have been made at trial under a
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
plain error analysis involving the failure to adequately advise a
criminal defendant under Tachibana .
"It is inherently difficult, if not impossible, to
divine what effect a violation of the defendant's constitutional
right to testify had on the outcome of any particular case.  The
record in this case offers no clue to what [the defendant] would
have said, under oath, on the witness stand."  Pomroy, 132
Hawai#i at 94, 319 P.3d at 1102 (quoting State v. Hoang , 94
Hawai#i 271, 279, 12 P.3d 371, 379 (2000)).  Therefore, the error
was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  Id. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment and
Notice of Entry of Judgment, entered on May 3, 2017, in the
District Court of the Third Circuit, North and South Hilo
Division, is vacated and the case is remanded for a new trial.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, May 18, 2018.
