IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI #I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
GABRIEL ALISNA, Defendant-Appellee
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CR. NO. 13-1-1861)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By:  Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Chan, JJ.)
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
appellate jurisdiction over Third-Party/Appellant Trustees of the
Estate of Bernice Pauahi Bishop doing business as Kamehameha
Schools' (Kamehameha Schools) appeal from the Honorable Rom A.
Trader's May 5, 2017 interlocutory findings of fact, conclusions
of law, and order denying Kamehameha Schools' motion to close
courtroom and to seal testimony (May 5, 2017 FOF/COL/Order) in
circuit court criminal case number 1PC13-1â€“1861.  The circuit
court has not yet entered a judgment or order that terminated the
proceedings in the underlying case.  It appears that the
appropriate means for Kamehameha Schools to obtain review of the
challenged May 5, 2017 FOL/COL/Order is through a petition for
writ of mandamus to the supreme court, and not an appeal to this
court.  See State v. Niswalt, 139 Hawai #i 86, 384 P.3d 862 (2016);
Oahu Publications Inc. v. Ahn , 133 Hawai #i 482, 331 P.3d 460
(2014).  Indeed, Kamehameha Schools filed a petition for mandamus
regarding the challenged order which was denied after a review onNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
the merits by the supreme court in SCPW-17-0000455 (July 19,
2017).
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
case number CAAP-17-0000452 is dismissed for lack of appellate
jurisdiction.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, November 16, 2017.
