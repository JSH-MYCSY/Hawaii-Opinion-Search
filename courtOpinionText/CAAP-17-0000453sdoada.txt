SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Chan, JJ.)
Defendant/Cross-Claim Plaintiff/Cross-Claim
Defendant/Appellant Gisele M.L. Gardner (Gardner) appeals from
the Circuit Court of the First Circuit's (1) January 6, 2017
"Order Denying [Gardner's] Motion to Compel and For Sanctions

1The Honorable Bert I. Ayabe entered the Order Denying Sanctions.

and Cancellation of Notice Of Pendency of Action (Order
Confirming Sale); and (3) the May 5, 2017 Judgment.3
Gardner argues that the Circuit Court erred:
1.In "conclud[ing] the parties did not have an
agreement for private sale;"
2. By (1)  concluding the Stipulation was not
enforceable or that Defendants/Cross-Claim
Defendants/Cross-Claim Plaintiffs/Appellees Travis
Wittmeyer, Kanoa Bristol, and Blue Wave Investment
Solutions, LLC (collectively Wittmeyer) had not
breached the stipulation, and (2) failing to
strike Wittmeyer's statement of facts as presented
in Wittmeyer's memorandum in opposition to the
Motion to Compel; and
3. In denying her request for sanctions against
Wittmeyer and their attorneys.
After a careful review of the points raised and the
arguments made by the parties, the record on appeal, and the
applicable legal authorities, we resolve Gardner's appeal as
follows and affirm.
1.The Circuit Court’s finding there was no agreement
for a private sale was not clearly erroneous.  Gardner contends
that the Circuit Court erred "in conclud[ing] there was no
agreement by the parties to a private sale," relying upon the
written September 27, 2016 First Stipulation to Continue
Foreclosure Sale (Stipulation) as proof of the agreement.  
Regardless of whether the Stipulation is a "settlement
agreement," or a stipulation, we interpret it using contract law
principles.  See Standard Mgmt., Inc. v. Kekona, 99 Hawai# i 125,
133-34, 53 P.3d 264, 272-73 (App. 2001) (using contract
principles to interpret settlement agreement calling for
stipulation to dismiss).  "A party who relies upon a contract
must prove its existence[.]"  Durette v. Aloha Plastic Recycling,
Inc., 105 Hawai#i 490, 504, 100 P.3d 60, 74 (2004) (quoting
Hertzog v. Hertzog, 29 Pa. St. 465, 469 (1857)); see also
Boteilho v. Boteilho, 58 Haw. 40, 42, 564 P.2d 144, 146 (1977)
(party seeking to enforce oral contract must prove its terms "by
3The Honorable Jeannette H. Castagnetti entered the May 5, 2017
Order Confirming Sale and Judgment.
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
clear and convincing evidence").  A binding contract requires  "a
meeting of the minds on all essential elements or terms."  Earl
M. Jorgensen Co. v. Mark Constr., Inc., 56 Haw. 466, 470, 540
P.2d 978, 982 (1975) (citations omitted).  "To be enforceable, a
contract must be certain and definite as to its essential terms." 
Boteilho, 58 Haw. at 42, 564 P.2d at 146. 
The intent of the parties is a question of fact.
Hanagami v. China Airlines, Ltd., 67 Haw. 357, 364, 688 P.2d
1139, 1145 (1984).  "The intention of the parties is to be
gathered from the whole instrument[.]"  Pancakes of Hawaii, Inc.
v. Pomare Props. Corp., 85 Hawai# i 300, 305, 944 P.2d 97, 102
(App. 1997) (quoting Coney v. Dowsett, 3 Haw. 685, 686 (1876)). 
Ambiguity in the terms of the document raises questions regarding
the parties' intent to agree.  Found. Int'l, Inc. v. E.T. Ige
Constr., Inc.,, 102 Hawai#i 487, 497, 78 P.3d 23, 33 (2003); see
also 1 Corbin, Contracts § 4.10 (2019).  "[W]hether a contract
contains ambiguous terms is a threshold question of law for the
court to decide."  Wittig v. Allianz, A.G., 112 Hawai# i 195, 201,
145 P.3d 738, 744 (2006).  "A contract is ambiguous when the
terms of the contract are reasonably susceptible to more than one
meaning."  Airgo, Inc. v. Horizon Cargo Transp., Inc., 66 Haw.
590, 594, 670 P.2d 1277, 1280 (1983).
Looking at the Stipulation, Paragraphs 2 and 3 call
upon the parties to "cooperate" in the sale of the property.  The
word cooperate has two definitions; one definition requires
collaboration, while another requires compliance with another’s
directives.  Macmillan Dictionary, https://
www.macmillandictionary.com/us/dictionary/american/cooperate
(last visited Nov. 26, 2019); see also Merriam–Webster's
Collegiate Dictionary at 275 (11th ed. 2003).  Thus, "cooperate"
is an ambiguous term.4
"[P]arol evidence is admissible to explain the
circumstances surrounding the execution of the contract to lend
the trial judge insight into the meaning of the contract."  
4The contract principle of resolving ambiguity against the drafter,
see, e.g., Coney, 3 Haw. at 686, cannot be applied here as the Stipulation was
drafted by Provident.
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Hokama v. Relinc Corp., 57 Haw. 470, 474, 559 P.2d 279, 282
(1977).  In examining the circumstances around contract
formation, "[t]he existence of mutual assent or intent to accept
is determined by an objective standard."  Siopes v. Kaiser Found.
Health Plan, Inc., 130 Hawai# i 437, 447, 312 P.3d 869, 879 (2013)
(quoting Douglass v. Pflueger Hawaii, Inc., 110 Hawai# i 520, 531,
135 P.3d 129, 140 (2006)).
A party's words or acts are judged under a standard of
reasonableness in determining whether he [or she] has
manifested an objective intention to agree.  All reasonable
meanings will be imputed as representative of a party's
corresponding objective intention.  It follows that the
purely subjective, or secret, intent of a party in assenting
is irrelevant in an inquiry into the contractual intent of
the parties.  Unexpressed intentions are nugatory when the
problem is to ascertain the legal relations, if any, between
two parties.
Standard Mgmt., 99 Hawai#i at 134, 53 P.3d at 273 (quoting
Jorgensen, 56 Haw. at 470-71, 540 P.2d at 982) (brackets in
original, format altered, internal quotation marks omitted).
At the December 20, 2016 hearing, the three parties'
counsel provided argument regarding the intent behind the
Stipulation.  Gardner's counsel argued the Stipulation arose
after attempts to settle the related civil case, pointing to a
hearing where "it was strongly pointed out that a joint sale
would be a way to resolve this."  Wittmeyer's counsel told the
court that his clients "continued to propose to proceed on a
mutual basis with a mutually acceptable realtor" to accomplish
such a sale.  Provident's attorney maintained that the
Stipulation was drafted by Provident's counsel to provide the
bank with some assurance that the parties would work to settle
their "dysfunction" as an alternative to the foreclosure sale but
gave them a deadline so the bank "would not be waiting
indefinitely[.]"
The parties argue on appeal that the Stipulation was
meant to be a stipulation but each cite different purposes.  If
the Stipulation was indeed intended to be a settlement agreement
between Gardner and Wittmeyer, it lacked written terms to that
effect.  It contains no waiver of the disputed rights to the
property, no agreement to settle the related civil case, no
agreement to terminate the notice of pendency of action filed
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
based on the related civil case, and no agreement to release
Gardner's and Wittmeyer's indemnification and contribution cross-
claims against each other in this case.  "The essential elements
of an agreement to settle a case are a manifestation of agreement
(an offer and acceptance) on payment, release, and case dismissal
terms (the consideration) between parties who have the capacity
and authority to agree."  Gates Corp. v. Bando Chem. Indus., 4
F. App'x 676, 685-86 (10th Cir. 2001) (citing Worthy v. McKesson
Corp., 756 F.2d 1370, 1373 (8th Cir. 1985)) (emphasis added);
Tocci v. Antioch Univ., 967 F. Supp. 2d 1176, 1198 (S.D. Ohio
2013) (citing Riordan's Sporting Goods, Inc. v. Riordan's Sports
& Equip., LLC, 2003 Ohio 3878 at *3 (Ohio Ct. App. 2003)
("disagreement over . . . whether the agreement releases all
pending claims in the lawsuit renders terms too unclear and
uncertain for a court to enforce the agreement."); MKM Eng'rs,
Inc. v. Guzder, 476 S.W.3d 770, 778 (Tex. App. 2015) ("Essential
or material terms of a . . . settlement agreement include payment
terms and release of claims."). 
The Circuit Court also considered and rejected the
notion that the parties had an agreement for sale of land.  In an
agreement for the sale of land, the "[e]ssential terms are the
identification of the parties, a description of the property
sold, the price, the time and manner of payment and any other
terms in the agreement which are essential to the agreement."  In
re Application of Sing Chong Co., Ltd., 1 Haw. App. 236, 239, 617
P.2d 578, 581 (1980) (quoting Francone v. McClay, 41 Haw. 72
(1955)).  The plain language of the Stipulation indicates that
material terms regarding a sale of the property were missing. 
For example, the second paragraph requires Provident's approval
of an unidentified buyer and does not specify the minimum price
that would be acceptable to the parties as a "full payoff" in a
private sale; the third paragraph acknowledges that the April
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
contract  also depends on Provident's approval;  the fifth
paragraph provides "[t]he disposition of any excess proceeds will
be for the remaining parties and the Court to determine/decide."6 5
An agreement that leaves an essential element "to be
settled by further negotiation . . . is merely an agreement to
agree and is not a valid and binding contract."  Carson v. Saito,
53 Haw. 178, 181, 489 P.2d 636, 638 (1971).  "[A]greements to
agree are unenforceable."  Globalmart, Inc. v. Posec Hawaii Inc., 
127 Hawai#i 412, 279 P.3d 77, No. 28249, 2012 WL 1650697 at *7 
(App. May 10, 2012) (mem.); see also Honolulu Waterfront Ltd.
P'ship v. Aloha Tower Dev. Corp., 692 F. Supp. 1230, 1235
(D. Haw. 1988), aff'd, 891 F.2d 295 (9th Cir. 1989)("[T]he
overwhelming weight of authority holds that courts will not
enforce an agreement to negotiate.").
Given the essential terms the parties had left to work
out regarding the sale of the property, the Circuit Court was not
clearly erroneous in finding lack of agreement on the sale.  
Island Directory Co., Inc. v. Iva's Kinimaka Enters., Inc., 10
Haw. App. 15, 23, 859 P.2d 935, 940 (1993).  The court could not
imply the essential terms necessary for enforcement.  Cf. Sing
Chong, 1 Haw. App. at 240, 617 P.2d at 581 ("[W]here the
agreement does not specify or fully express an essential term but
does specify the method of ascertaining it, that term shall be
deemed to be complete and certain.").  Where agreement cannot be
ascertained from terms in the agreement or implied in law, there
is no binding contract.  Jorgensen, 56 Haw. at 470, 540 P.2d at
982. 
2.We do not need to consider whether Wittmeyer
breached the purported contract because there was no binding
contract.  The issue of a breach of contract is to be addressed
only after "a contract has been found[] and its essential terms
have been identified and determined to be enforceable[.]"  Moran
v. Guerreiro, 97 Hawai# i 354, 371, 37 P.3d 603, 620 (App. 2001). 
5Gardner entered a purchase contract (the April contract) with two
third-party buyers on April 29, 2016, for $700,000.
6Provident had not yet approved the April contract as a short sale
when the Stipulation was signed.
6NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
The Circuit Court did not err in refusing to grant Gardner's
Motion to Compel performance of the April contract.
3.Gardner failed to demonstrate abuse of discretion
by the Circuit Court's denial of her motion for sanctions.  A
court cannot invoke its inherent powers to sanction without a
specific finding of bad faith.  Bank of Hawaii v. Kunimoto, 91
Hawai#i 372, 389–90, 984 P.2d 1198, 1215–16 (1999).
This finding is the "distinction [that] must be made between
zealous advocacy and plain pettifoggery."  Id., at 390, 984 P.2d
at 1216 (citation omitted).  
 A trial court's decision to refuse to impose sanctions
is "due a substantial degree of deference."  Deutsche Bank Nat'l
Tr. Co. v. Greenspon, 143 Hawai#i 237, 244, 428 P.3d 749, 756
(2018) (quoting In re Hawaiian Flour Mills, Inc., 76 Hawai#i 1,
15, 868 P.2d 419, 433 (1994)) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
The denial of a motion for sanctions "will generally be upheld
unless it 'exceeds' bounds of reason, all of the circumstances
before it being considered."  Id. at 244–45, 428 P.3d at 756–57
(citing Gap v. Puna Geothermal Venture, 106 Hawai# i 325, 339, 104
P.3d 912, 926 (2004)).
Bad faith is defined as an "actual or constructive
fraud or a neglect or refusal to fulfill some duty . . . not
prompted by an honest mistake as to one's rights or duties, but
by some interested or sinister motive."  Kunimoto, 91 Hawai#i at 
390, 984 P.2d at 1216 (quoting In re Estate of Marks, 957 P.2d
235, 241 (Wash. Ct. App. 1998)) (internal quotation marks
omitted).
Gardner alleges that Wittmeyer and attorneys should be
sanctioned for their representations that a "potential buyer"
would bid (1) over $700,000 at auction and (2) at least $750,000
at auction, bids that ultimately failed to materialize.  
Although Gardner alleges they had a sinister motive in doing so,
she concedes that Rose  had no obligation to bid.  The
representations that there would be higher bids, in fact, helped
Gardner because they were the basis for re-opening the public7

sale, which garnered a higher price for the property and whose
confirmation Gardner does not challenge on appeal.  Gardner fails
to produce any evidence that the claims were made fraudulently.
The transcript of the December 20, 2016 hearing
indicates that Wittmeyer's counsel told the court that the bidder
was not his client.  The Circuit Court weighed the comments,
judged Wittmeyer's counsel's credibility, and ruled accordingly. 
The credibility of witnesses is "within the province of the trial
court and, generally, will not be disturbed on appeal." 
Kunimoto, 91 Hawai# i at 390–91, 984 at 1216–17.  The Circuit
Court did not exceed the bounds of reason nor abuse its
discretion in denying Gardner's motion for sanctions.
For the foregoing reasons, the May 5, 2017 Order
Granting Plaintiff Provident Funding Associates, L.P.'s Motion
for Confirmation of Sale, Deficiency Judgment, For Writ of
Possession and Cancellation of Notice Of Pendency of Action and
the May 5, 2017 Judgment entered by the Circuit Court of the
First Circuit are affirmed.
