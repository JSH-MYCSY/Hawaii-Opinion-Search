APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 12-1-0805 (1))
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
jurisdiction over this appeal, which Defendants-Appellants
Rogelio P. Magbual and Zenaida D. Magbual (the Magbuals), 
pro se, apparently asserted from the Honorable Rhonda I.L. Loo's
June 16, 2016 judgment on an order confirming the sale of the
foreclosed property in the underlying foreclosure case, Civil 
No. 12-1-0805(1).NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
The Magbuals' April 10, 2017 notice of appeal does not
designate any order or judgment, but their April 11, 2017 civil
appeals docketing statement refers to their objection to a
February 26, 2016 auction of the foreclosed property that took
place on the same day that the Magbuals petitioned for bankruptcy
in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Hawaii 
in Case No. 16-00190. Pursuant to an order of this court on 
June 2, 2017 and Rules 54(b) and (c) of the Hawai #i Rules of
Appellate Procedure (HRAP), Plaintiff-Appellee NationStar
Mortgage, LLC, filed with this court a certified copy of the
bankruptcy court's February 29, 2016 order dismissing Case 
No. 16-00190 and thereby terminating the automatic bankruptcy
stay.
 The most recent appealable document in the record
before the Magbuals filed their April 10, 2017 notice of appeal
is the June 16, 2016 judgment on the order confirming the sale of
the foreclosed property, which the circuit court certified for
appeal pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Hawai
#i Rules of Civil
Procedure, making it immediately appealable pursuant to Hawaii
Revised Statutes ยง 667-51(a)(2) (2016).  Nevertheless, the
Magbuals did not file their April 10, 2017 notice of appeal
within thirty days after entry of the June 16, 2016 judgment, as
HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) required for a timely appeal.  The failure to
file a timely notice of appeal in a civil matter is a
jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot waive and the
appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise of judicial
discretion.  Bacon v. Karlin , 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127,
1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or justice is
authorized to change the jurisdictional requirements contained in
Rule 4 of these rules."); HRAP Rule 26(e) ("The reviewing court
for good cause shown may relieve a party from a default
occasioned by any failure to comply with these rules, except the
failure to give timely notice of appeal.").  Therefore, we lack
appellate jurisdiction over the Magbuals' appeal.
