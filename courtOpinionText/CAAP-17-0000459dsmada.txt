NO. CAAP-17-0000459
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
SAMUEL COOPER, JR., Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI #I, Respondent-Appellee
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(S.P.P. NO. 17-1-0005 (CR. NOS. 99-0-1708 and 00-1-0474))
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By:  Nakamura, C.J., Leonard and Chan, JJ.)
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
appellate jurisdiction over Petitioner-Appellant Samuel Cooper,
Jr.'s (Appellant Cooper), appeal from Respondent-Appellee State
of Hawaii's (Appellee State) April 28, 2017 answer to Appellant
Cooper's March 21, 2017 petition for post-conviction relief
pursuant to Rule 40 of the Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP)
in S.P.P. No. 17-1-0005.  Apparently, Appellant Cooper mistakenly
believes that Appellee State's April 28, 2017 answer is an order
of the circuit court, the Honorable Colette Y. Garibaldi
presiding.
"The right of appeal in a criminal case is purely
statutory and exists only when given by some constitutional or
statutory provision."  State v. Poohina , 97 Hawai #i 505, 509, 40
P.3d 907, 911 (2002) (citation and internal quotation marks
omitted).  "In a circuit court criminal case, a defendant may
appeal from the judgment of the circuit court, see  [Hawaii
Revised Statutes (HRS)] ยง 641-11 (1993), from a certified
interlocutory order, see HRS ยง 641-17 (1993), or from an
interlocutory order denying a motion to dismiss based on doubleNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
jeopardy."  State v. Kealaiki , 95 Hawai #i 309, 312, 22 P.3d 588,
591 (2001) (citation omitted).  Therefore, pursuant to HRS ยง 641-
11 (2016) and "HRPP [Rule] 40(h), appeals from proceedings for
post-conviction relief may be made from a judgment entered in the
proceeding and must be taken in accordance with Rule 4(b) of the
Hawai#i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP)."  Grattafiori v.
State, 79 Hawai #i 10, 13, 897 P.2d 937, 940 (1995) (internal
quotation marks and brackets omitted).  Hawai #i courts have
consistently acknowledged in analogous circumstances that an
order qualifies as an appealable final order in its own right
only if it meets the test of finality applicable to all judicial
decisions.  Familian Northwest, Inc. v. Cent. Pac. Boiler &
Piping, Ltd., 68 Haw. 368, 369, 714 P.2d 936, 937 (1986)
(citation omitted).  The nature and effect of the order controls
whether the order is final:
"Final order" means an order ending the proceedings, leaving
nothing further to be accomplished.  Consequently, an order
is not final if the rights of a party involved remain
undetermined or if the matter is retained for further
action.
Id. (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  As the
Supreme Court of Hawai# i explained in a similarly premature
appeal from a HRPP Rule 40 post-conviction relief proceeding that
lacked a final judgment or final order,
[w]hile we treat an appeal as timely where a defendant has
filed his or her notice of appeal after the court has
announced an oral decision but before the entry of a written
order or judgment, see  HRAP 4(b), we cannot do so where the
court has rendered no decision whatsoever. . . . 
Consequently, we are without jurisdiction to address the
merits of Grattafiori's appeal.
Grattafiori v. State, 79 Hawai #i at 14, 897 P.2d at 941 (original
emphasis).
Likewise in the instant case, the circuit court has not
yet entered a final order or final judgment that resolves all of
the issues in Appellant Cooper's March 21, 2017 HRPP Rule 40
petition for post-conviction relief in S.P.P. No. 17-1-0005. 
Absent an appealable final order or appealable final judgment,
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Appellant Cooper's appeal in appellate court case number CAAP-17-
0000459 is premature, and we lack appellate jurisdiction.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
case number CAAP-17-0000459 is dismissed for lack of appellate
jurisdiction.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, November 17, 2017.
