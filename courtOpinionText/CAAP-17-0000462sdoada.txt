APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Chan, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Daryl N. Thomas (Thomas) appeals
from the "Judgment of Conviction and Sentence" (Judgment ) entered
against him and in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai# i
(the State ) on May 23, 2017, by the Circuit Court of the First
Circuit ( Circuit Court).   Following a jury-waived trial, Thomas
was found guilty of the offense of Violation of Restraining Order
or Injunction against Harassment in violation of Hawaii Revised
Statutes ( HRS) ยง 604-10.5(i) (2016),  and sentenced to one year21

of incarceration with credit for time served.  
In his sole point of error on appeal, Thomas asserts
that the Circuit Court erred in denying his motion to dismiss
pursuant to Hawai# i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 48.  We
conclude there are insufficient findings for us to review this
appeal and thus remand for further proceedings.  
HRPP Rule 48(b)(1) requires criminal charges to be
dismissed if trial does not commence within 180 days from the
arrest or the filing of charges, whichever is sooner.  State v.
Hoey, 77 Hawai#i 17, 28, 881 P.2d 504, 515 (1994).  Thomas
contends that the Circuit Court erred when it found that less
than 180 "includable" days elapsed between his arrest on January
27, 2014 and the day of his trial on May 22, 2017.  Specifically,
Thomas asserts that the Circuit Court erred in excluding the
following periods: (1) the 26-day period between his May 1, 2014
Circuit Court arraignment and plea hearing and the May 27, 2014
trial call; and (2) the 28-day period between the June 9, 2014
2(...continued)
(i) A knowing or intentional violation of a restraining
order or injunction issued pursuant to this section is a
misdemeanor. The court shall sentence a violator to appropriat
counseling and shall sentence a person convicted under this
section as follows: e
(1) For a violation of an injunction or restraining order
that occurs after a conviction for a violation of the
same injunction or restraining order, the person shall
be sentenced to a mandatory minimum jail sentence of
not less than forty-eight hours; and 
(2) For any subsequent violation that occurs after a
second conviction for violation of the same injunction
or restraining order, the person shall be sentenced to
a mandatory minimum jail sentence of not less than
thirty days. 
The court may suspend any jail sentence, except for the
mandatory sentences under paragraphs (1) and (2), upon appropriate
conditions, such as that the defendant remain alcohol- and drug-
free, conviction-free, or complete court-ordered assessments or
counseling. The court may suspend the mandatory sentences under
paragraphs (1) and (2) where the violation of the injunction or
restraining order does not involve violence or the threat of
violence. Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting
the discretion of the judge to impose additional sanctions
authorized in sentencing for a misdemeanor offense.

hearing on his motion to recall bench warrant and the July 7,
2014 hearing on the State's motion to consolidate cases. 
However, we are not able to address Thomas's contentions because
the Circuit Court did not state its essential findings into the
record in its oral denial of Thomas's motion.  See State v.
Hutch, 75 Haw. 307, 329-31, 861 P.2d 11, 22-23 (1993) (holding
that the trial court commits reversible error where it fails to
state into the record the essential findings it relies on in its
denial of an HRPP Rule 48 motion).  We note that the parties'
appellate briefs have conflicting information regarding the
periods of time that are in dispute. 
"[M]otions to dismiss pursuant to HRPP 48(b), by their
very nature, involve factual issues that must be resolved before
they can be decided."  Id. at 331, 861 P.2d at 23.  "Where
factual issues are involved in determining a motion, the court
shall state its essential findings on the record."  Id. at 329-
30, 861 P.2d at 22 (emphasis omitted) (quoting HRPP 12(e)).
At the hearing on Thomas's motion to dismiss, the
Circuit Court stated the following pertaining to its HRPP Rule 48
calculation: 
THE COURT: Okay. So the Court just wants to
point out a couple of periods that we disagree with. So date
of arrest to A and P clearly is charged to the State. A and
P referred to PD should be charged to the State. 
The rereferral is not charged to the State. All
of that time period that goes down through the bench
warrants and all the defense continuances are clearly not
charged to the State. 
December 27th, 2016, when the defendant is found
fit, to 2/21 should be charged to the State. And then pretty
much the rest of the time should be charged to the State.
According to our calculations, it still comes 
out to about 171 days.   
We first note that it is unclear whether the
calculation the Circuit Court entered into the record was in
reference to the instant case.  At the May 19, 2017 hearing, the
Circuit Court presided over Thomas's motions to dismiss pursuant
to HRPP Rule 48 filed in the instant case (1PC141000664) and also
in an unrelated case to this appeal (1PC141000677).  In its oral
ruling, the Circuit Court did not explicitly state which case it
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
was referring to in its HRPP Rule 48 calculation.   While Thomas
asserts on appeal that the calculation stated above was in
reference to the instant case, the Circuit Court appears to state
that this calculation was in reference to 1PC141000677 on two
occasions during the hearing.3
Even assuming that the Circuit Court's calculation was
in reference to the instant case, the record is insufficient to
enable this court to perform an adequate review.  In its oral
ruling denying Thomas's motion, the Circuit Court necessarily
concluded that fewer than 180 "includable" days had elapsed.
However, it is unclear how the Circuit Court reached its
conclusion that "about 171 days" elapsed between Thomas's arrest
and his trial.  While the parties appear to agree that certain
time periods were appropriately excluded from calculation,
including the periods that Thomas moved for continuances and the
period during which Thomas's fitness to proceed was being
evaluated, they assert varying timelines and arguments as to
whether certain other delays are excludable.   4
Further, while the Circuit Court's oral ruling suggests
that the Circuit Court intended to exclude certain days relating
to Thomas's "rereferral", presumably to the Office of the Public
Defender, and "[a]ll of that time period that goes down through
the bench warrants and all the defense continuances" from HRPP
Rule 48 calculation, it neglects to state any explanation of the
precise number of days it excluded from its calculation or its
basis for doing so.  In light of the disputed periods of time
3  The Circuit Court did not enter a written order denying Thomas's
motion to dismiss in this case.  
4  Thomas asserts that the 26-day period between his May 1, 2014 Circuit
Court arraignment and plea hearing and the May 27, 2014 trial call should have
been included in the HRPP Rule 48 calculation.  In response, the State appears
to concede that this 26-day period was includable, however, argues that the
30-day period between January 28, 2014 and February 27, 2014 was excludable.
Thomas also contends that the 28-day period from June 9, 2014 to July 7,
2014 should have been included in the HRPP Rule 48 calculation.  In response,
the State argues that this period of delay was excludable under HRPP Rule
48(c)(3) and/or (c)(8).  
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
that each party argues, we are not able to perform an adequate
review without essential findings by the Circuit Court.  See
Hutch, 75 Haw. at 329-31, 861 P.2d at 22-23.  
Based on the foregoing, this case must be remanded for
the entry of appropriate findings and a further order that meets
the requirements of Hutch.  If on remand, the Circuit Court
determines that HRPP Rule 48 was violated, it must vacate the
Judgment and dismiss the charge against Thomas, with or without
prejudice in its discretion, in accordance with State v.
Estencion, 63 Haw. 264, 269, 625 P.2d 1040, 1044 (1981).  If the
Circuit Court finds and concludes that HRPP Rule 48 was not
violated, Thomas would be free to file a new appeal.  
Accordingly, we vacate the Circuit Court's denial of
Thomas's HRPP Rule 48 motion to dismiss, and we remand this case
for further proceedings consistent with this order.
