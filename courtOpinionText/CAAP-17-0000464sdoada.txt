Upon careful review of the record and the relevant
 
legal authorities, and giving due consideration to the issues
 
raised and the arguments advanced by the parties, we affirm.
 
In this case, Minor and Complaining Witness (CW) were
 
residents of Hale Kipa shelter (Hale Kipa) in Ewa Beach. On
 
February 15, 2017, Minor and the CW left Hale Kipa without
 
permission and were reported as runaways. Four days later, on
 February 19, 2017, Minor and the CW returned to Hale Kipa. On
 February 22, 2017, the CW asserted that Minor had committed the
 charged offenses.
 
The CW testified to the following during trial. Minor
 
injected the CW with an unknown substance, without the CW's
 consent, which resulted in the CW passing out and losing
 consciousness. Upon regaining consciousness, the CW noticed that
 she was laying on a bed and that she was naked from the waist
 down. The CW also noticed that Minor was completely naked. 
Minor inserted an unknown object into the CW's vagina. Minor
 also placed her mouth on the CW's vagina. Minor also touched
 both breasts of the CW. The CW told Minor to stop and did not
 consent to Minor's conduct. The CW kicked Minor in the face and
 told Minor to stop. Minor told another person to handcuff the CW
 to a shelf above the bed. The CW cried and screamed. The CW
 also testified that, at a later time, Minor pointed a gun at the
 CW and that Minor told the CW that she would kill the CW. 
Minor testified in her defense during trial. According
 
to Minor, the CW was never forced to do anything that she did not
 want to do and that Minor never committed the alleged offenses. 
The Family Court issued "Findings of Fact and 
Conclusions of Law" on October 2, 2017. Minor does not contest any of the Family Court's Findings of Fact (FOFs) and therefore 
the findings are binding on this court. State v. Torres, 125 
Hawai'i 382, 388, 262 P.3d 1006, 1012 (2011); Okada Trucking Co., 
Ltd. v. Bd. of Water Supply, 97 Hawai' i 450, 458, 40 P.3d 73, 81 
(2002). The FOFs pertinent to this appeal are as follows: 
5. Between February 16, 2017, up to and including February
19, 2017, Minor knowingly committed an act of sexual penetration
on [CW] by inserting an object into [CW's] genital opening. At

knowingly caused to be administered to [CW] without [CW's]

7. Between February 16, 2017, up to and including February
19, 2017, Minor knowingly committed an act of sexual contact on
[CW] by Minor placing Minor's hand on [CW's] breast. At the time,
[CW] was mentally incapacitated and/or physically helpless as a
result of the influence of a substance that Minor knowingly caused
to be administered to [CW] without [CW's] consent. [CW] was
mentally incapacitated and/or physically helpless as a result of
Minor injecting into [CW], more than once, an unknown substance,

8. Between February 16, 2017, up to and including February
19, 2017, Minor threatened, by word or conduct, to cause bodily
injury to [CW], with the use of a simulated firearm, with the
intent to terrorize, or in reckless disregard of the risk of
terrorizing [CW]. (Referral 7) 
9. [CW] identified Minor as the person who committed the
offenses in the petitions. 
10. [CW's] testimony was deemed credible by the Court.
 
11. [CW's] testimony was corroborated by the testimony of
Stacy Peiler, program coordinator for Hale Kipa. Ms. Peiler's
 testimony was deemed credible by the Court. 
12. [CW's] testimony was further corroborated by the
testimony of Honolulu Police Department ("HPD") Officer William
Simpson. Officer Simpson's testimony was deemed credible by the
Court. 
13. [CW's] testimony was further corroborated by the
testimony of HPD Officer John Castillo. Officer Castillo's
 testimony was deemed credible by the Court. 
14. [CW's] testimony was further corroborated by the
testimony of DHS Social Worker Julie Tsutsui. Ms. Tsutsui's
 testimony was deemed credible by the Court. 
15. [CW's] testimony was further corroborated by the
testimony of HPD Detective David Yamamoto. Detective Yamamoto's
 testimony was deemed credible by the Court. 
16. [CW's] testimony was corroborated by State's Exhibit

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
17. [CW's] testimony was corroborated by State's Exhibit
#4, which is a letter written by Minor to [CW]. Minor wrote
 
Exhibit #4 after the offenses were committed. Minor left Exhibit
 #4 on [CW's] bed at Hale Kipa. 
18. [CW's] testimony was corroborated by State's Exhibit #6
and State's Exhibit #7, which are screen shots of HPD Detective
Yamamoto's telephone that show phone calls and text messages,
respectively, received from the telephone number . . . (CW's
telephone number).
 
19. Minor testified in the trial. Minor's testimony was
deemed not credible by the Court, except for Minor's testimony
that was consistent with the testimony of [CW].
 
Minor contends the Family Court was not presented with
 
sufficient evidence to prove that Minor was a law violator. 
"When a conviction is challenged based on the sufficiency of the
 evidence, the test on appeal is not whether guilt is established
 beyond a reasonable doubt, but whether there was substantial
 evidence to support the conclusion of the trier of fact." State
 
v. Griffin, 126 Hawai' i 40, 56, 266 P.3d 448, 464 (App. 2011) 
(quoting State v. Richie, 88 Hawai' i 19, 33, 960 P.2d 1227, 1241 
(1998)) (internal quotation marks omitted). "Substantial evidence is credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion." Id. (quoting Richie, 88 Hawai' i at 33, 
960 P.2d at 1241) (internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted). 
Minor does not address the evidence that was presented 
by the State at trial. Rather, Minor focuses on her own testimony and contends that she "never forced [CW] to do anything that she didn't already want to do, that she didn't sexually assault [CW] and that she never threatened [CW] with a gun." In short, Minor seeks to have this court determine that her testimony was more credible than CW's testimony and the other evidence presented by the State. However, "it is well-settled that an appellate court will not pass upon issues dependent upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence; this is the province of the [trier of fact]." State v. Buch, 83 
Hawai'i 308, 321, 926 P.2d 599, 612 (1996) (citation omitted).

Moreover, as noted above, Minor does not challenge any 
of the Family Court's FOFs. Thus, the FOFs are binding on this 
court and conclusions flowing from those findings will be upheld. State v. Kiese, 126 Hawai' i 494, 502, 273 P.3d 1180, 1188 (2012); 
Stanford Carr Dev. Corp. v. Unity House, Inc., 111 Hawai' i 286, 
303 n.10, 141 P.3d 459, 476 n.10 (2006) ("It is axiomatic that if a finding is not properly attacked, it is binding; and any conclusion which follows from it and is a correct statement of law is valid.") (citation and internal brackets and quotation marks omitted). 
Here, the Family Court's unchallenged FOFs support its
 
conclusions that Minor was a law violator for two counts of
 Sexual Assault in the First Degree, one count of Sexual Assault
 in the Third Degree, and one count of Terroristic Threatening in
 the First Degree. Moreover, based on our review of the evidence
 in the record, there is sufficient evidence to support the Family
 Court's conclusions that Minor was a law violator as set forth
 above.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Decree Re:
 
Law Violation Petition(s)" filed on April 28, 2017, and the
 "Order Denying [Minor's] Motion to Reconsider Adjudication of
 Minor as a Law Violator and Motion to Reconsider Commitment to
 the Executive Director of the Office of Youth Services" filed on
 May 19, 2017, by the Family Court of the First Circuit, are
 affirmed.
