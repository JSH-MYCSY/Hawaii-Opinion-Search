 OPINION OF THE COURT BY MCCULLEN, J. 
 
  Appellants-Applicants/Appellants Edward Fujimori 
(Edward) and Florence Fujimori (Florence) (collectively, 
Fujimoris) appeal from the Circuit Court of the First Circuit's1 
April 26, 2017 order and May 11, 2017 judgment affirming 
Appellees/Appellees Department of Human Services' (DHS) 
administrative decisions denying Edward's and Florence's 
applications for Medicaid assistance to pay for their long-term 
care.  In challenging the circuit court's order and judgment, 
Edward and Florence request that we vacate and remand with 
instructions to "issue all benefits . . . determined to be due 
and owing since the time of their original applications."  We 
affirm the circuit court's order and judgment.

those whose income and resources are inadequate to meet the 
costs of necessary medical services."  Barham by Barham v. 
Rubin, 72 Haw. 308, 312, 816 P.2d 965, 967 (1991) (citing 42

01110.003.A.1, SI 01110.003.A.2 (effective Dec. 8, 2010). to qualify for Medicaid assistance.  See  Administrative Hawai‘i
"Through the practice known as Medicaid planning, 
however, individuals with significant resources devise 
strategies to appear impoverished in order to qualify for 
Medicaid benefits."  Fournier, 170 N.E.3d at 1164 (citation and 
internal quotation marks omitted).  "One such strategy is to transfer assets into an inter vivos trust, whereby funds appear 
to be out of the individual's control, yet generally are 
administered by a family member or loved one."  Id. (citation 
omitted).  "Accordingly, a loophole existed under the pre-1986 
law, pursuant to which individuals anticipating the need for 
expensive long-term medical care could impoverish themselves and 
qualify for Medicaid assistance while preserving their resources 
for their heirs."  Petition of Est. of Braiterman, 145 A.3d 682, 
687 (N.H. 2016) (cleaned up). 
In 1986, Congress responded to this loophole by 
enacting 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(k) (1988) (repealed 1993), which FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
4 
  "deemed available to the applicant (the beneficiary) the maximum 
amount that could, at the trustee's discretion, be distributed 
to the beneficiary from an irrevocable trust regardless of 
whether the funds were actually distributed."  Braiterman, 145 A.3d at 687 (cleaned up).  In other words, Medicaid qualifying 
trusts "were no longer a permissible means to shelter assets for 
purposes of Medicaid eligibility."  Id. at 688 (citation 
omitted).  "Congress sought to prevent wealthy individuals, 
otherwise ineligible for Medicaid benefits, from making 
themselves eligible by creating irrevocable trusts in order to 
preserve assets for their heirs."  Barham, 72 Haw. at 312, 816 
P.2d at 967 (citation omitted).  
"In 1993, in reaction to the sophisticated instruments 
used to circumvent the [Medicaid qualifying trust] rules, Congress repealed § 1396a(k) and enacted § 1396p(d) (1993), 
which was aimed at more effectively curtailing the use of trusts 
or similar mechanisms to qualify for Medicaid."  Braiterman, 145 
A.3d at 688 (cleaned up).  In that enactment, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, "Congress established a general rule 
that trusts would be counted as assets for the purpose of determining Medicaid eligibility."  Id. (citation omitted).  
With respect to an irrevocable trust, the act provides that 
"if there are any circumstances under which payment from 
the trust could be made to or for the benefit of the 
individual, the portion of the corpus from which, or the 
income on the corpus from which, payment to the individual 
could be made shall be considered resources available to 
the individual. " FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 Fournier, 170 N.E.3d at 1164 (quoting 42 U.S.C. 
§ 1396p(d)(3)(B)(i)). 
B. Edward And Florence Fujimori 
In August 2006, Edward and Florence created the 
"Edward M. and Florence Y.K. Fujimori Irrevocable Trust" (Trust
) 
"for the benefit of [their] descendants, by representation," and 
assigned their son, Alan Y. Fujimori, as trustee (Son).  That 
same day, they funded the Trust with their residential property 
at 5314 Uhiuhi Street in Honolulu (Property), reserving "a life 
estate in an undivided ten-thousandth (.0001 or 1/10,000) 
interest in and to" the Property.  (Formatting altered.) 
Six years later, in 2012, Son, as trustee, sold the 
Property for $700,000 to Clint and Lisa Kagami (Kagamis), and conveyed the Property by warranty deed.  In the same warranty 
deed, Edward and Florence conveyed their life estate in the 
undivided 0.0001% interest in the Property to the Kagamis.  Two 
checks totaling $666,873.81 ($333,436.90 and $333,436.91) were 
made payable to the Trust and were deposited into two separate 
bank accounts belonging to the Trust. 
Two years later, in July 2014, Florence applied for 
Medicaid assistance to pay for her long-term care, which was approved.  In September 2015, Edward applied for Medicaid 
assistance to pay for his long-term care, and had been given 
presumptive eligibility beginning December 16, 2015. FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
6 
 In December 2015, DHS requested that Florence provide 
information to "[v]erify life estate interest in a property."    
DHS, apparently, requested that Edward also provide more 
information. 
On January 8, 2016, Edward, through the Fujimoris' 
attorney, responded to DHS' request for more information by stating, 
Since the currents [sic] assets owned by the Irrevocable 
Trust are not a countable asset to Mr. Fujimori, the 
current bank statements of the Irrevocable Trust accounts 
that the Attorney General is requesting is not relevant to 
the applicant' s qualification purposes and infringes on the 
privacy of the beneficiaries of the trust. 
 
The response further asserted that the Fujimoris "did not keep a 
right to receive income, so when the trust sold the property in 
2012 Mr. and Mrs. Fujimori did not dispose of any income or 
asset."  (Emphasis omitted.) 
In April 2016, DHS terminated Medicaid assistance in 
paying for Edward's and Florence's long-term care effective 
June 1, 2016, because they did "not meet other program 
requirements" and their "[a]ssets exceed[ed] eligibility limits."  DHS also terminated assistance to Edward because the 
"[r]equired information was not provided." 
Before his Medicaid assistance was set to end, Edward 
passed away on May 20, 2016.  Edward's attorney requested that 
the administrative hearing proceed, but DHS denied the request 
because a "power of attorney terminates when the principal 
dies."  Edward's attorney then requested that Medicaid reimburse FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
7 
 Edward's estate for the three and one-half months (September 1, 
2015 to December 15, 2015) of long-term care Edward paid for 
while his application was pending, attaching an Affidavit for 
Collection of Personal Property signed by Son. 
DHS held an administrative hearing for Florence in 
June 2016 and for Edward in August 2016.  On August 10, 2016, DHS issued its Notice of Administrative Hearing Decision for 
Florence's request for Medicaid assistance, concluding that:   
(1)  "Under the [HAR], the Fujimori Trust is a 
'revocable' trust"; 
(2)  "Even assuming arguendo that the Fujimori Trust 
is 'irrevocable' for Medicaid purposes, the 
[Property] was a countable asset of [Florence]"; and 
(3)  Florence "also individually owned an undivided 
1/10,000
th interest in a life estate in the 
[Property]." 
(Formatting altered.)  A month later, on September 13, 2016, DHS 
issued its Notice of Administrative Hearing Decision for 
Edward's request for Medicaid assistance, concluding among other things that: 
(1) "Under the [HAR], the Fujimori Trust is a 'revocable' trust"; FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
8 
 (2) Edward "also individually owned an undivided 
1/10,000th interest in a life estate in the 
[Property] which was valued at $45,099.25"; and 
(3) "It is undisputed that [Edward] did not provide the information requested by [DHS] regarding the 
Fujimori Trust."  
(Formatting altered.) 
Florence and Edward timely appealed to the circuit 
court.  The circuit court consolidated the cases, and heard oral arguments.  Without addressing whether the Trust was revocable, 
the circuit court held that: 
(1) "The Hearing Officer did not err in concluding [Edward and Florence] had 'full' Life Estate interests in their [Property]";  
(2) "[T]he Hearing Officer did not err and properly affirmed [DHS'] denial of benefits to [Edward] 
for failure to provide requested updated 
information related to the status of assets in 
the Fujimori Trust, as required by HAR § 17-
1725.1-10(g)"; and  
(3) Florence "shall return any and all Aid Paid 
pending the August 10, 2016 administrative 
hearing decision, because [DHS] is the prevailing 
party." 
Florence and Edward timely appealed to this court.   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 STANDARD OF REVIEW 
  This court must determine whether the circuit court 
was right or wrong in its decision, applying the standards set 
forth in Hawaii Revised Statues (HRS) § 91-14(g) (2012) to the 
agency's decision.  AlohaCare v. Ito, 126 Hawai‘ i 326, 341, 271 
P.3d 621, 636 (2012).  HRS § 91-14(g) provides as follows: 
Upon review of the record the court may affirm the decision 
of the agency or remand the case with instructions for 
further proceedings; or it may reverse or modify the 
decision and order if the substantial rights of the 
petitioners may have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, conclusions, decisions, or orders 
are: 
 (1) In violation of constitutional or statutory 
provisions; or 
 
(2) In excess of the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the agency; or 
 
(3) Made upon unlawful procedure; or 
 
(4) Affected by other error of law; or 
 
(5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, 
probative, and substantial evidence on the whole 
record; or 
 
(6) Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized by 
abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted 
exercise of discretion.  
 
(Emphasis added.)  For subsection (5), 
administrative findings of fact are reviewed under the 
clearly erroneous standard, which requires [the appellate] 
court to sustain its findings unless the court is left with a firm and definite conviction that a mistake has been 
made.  Administrative conclusions of law, however, are 
reviewed under the de novo standard inasmuch as they are not binding on an appellate court.  Where both mixed 
questions of fact and law are presented, deference will be given to the agency' s expertise and experience in the 
particular field and the court should not substitute its own judgment for that of the agency.  To be granted 
deference, however, the agency' s decision must be 
consistent with the legislative purpose. FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

DISCUSSION 
  In this secondary appeal, the Fujimoris challenge the 
circuit court's holdings affirming (1) the finding that the 
Fujimoris had a full life estate, (2) that Florence reimburse 
DHS for aid paid pending the decision in her case, and (3) the 
denial of Edward's application for failing to provide 
information.2  Because the circuit court did not err in affirming 
DHS' decision, we too affirm. 
A. Transfer Of Life Estate For Less Than Market Value 
  First, Edward and Florence argue that the "circuit court clearly erred in affirming the hearing officer's finding 
that [they] had a full life estate interest in the [Property]" 
and that the Hearing Officer clearly erred because he "ignored 
the plain language of the August 17, 2006 deed as to the 
reservation of the small fractional interest" in the Property.  1. Medicaid and life estates 
Again, Medicaid is for the needy and is meant to be 
the payer of last resort.  Fournier, 170 N.E.3d at 1164; Est. of 
                                                           
2  The Fujimoris raise a fourth point of error, contending that the 
"circuit court erred in failing to reverse the hearing officer's conclusions 
that the Fujimori Trust is revocable and that the Fujimoris therefore had 
access to the Trust's assets and were ineligible for benefits."  Edward's 
failure to provide information and the fact that the fair market value of the 
life estates exceeded Medicaid limits were sufficient to affirm the hearing officer's (Hearing Officer) decisions.  Therefore, the circuit court did not 
err by deciding on those grounds and declining to rule on whether the Trust was revocable. FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 Scheidecker, 490 P.3d at 91.  As such, Congress made clear that 
a State's plan must provide that an individual is ineligible for 
medical assistance if that institutionalized individual or 
spouse "disposes of assets for less than fair market value on or after the look-back date . . . ."  42 U.S.C. § 1396p(c)(1)(A) 
(2013). 
Hawai‘i thus requires that an individual applying for 
long-term care assistance 
shall be assessed a penalty period for coverage of these 
services if the individual or the individual' s spouse, 
transferred an asset for less than fair market value within the applicable look- back period.  The length of the look-
back period shall be sixty months for an asset transferred 
on or after February 8, 2006. 
 
HAR § 17-1725.1-51(a).  "The transfer provision shall apply to 
an asset held by the individual and the individual's spouse when 
any action is taken that reduces or eliminates such individual's 
ownership or control of such asset."  HAR § 17-1725.1-51(c).  
An "'Asset' means cash and any other personal 
property, as well as real property, that an individual or family:  (1) Owns; (2) Has the right, authority, or power to 
convert to cash (if not already cash); and (3) Is not legally 
restricted from using for the individual's or family's support 
and maintenance."  HAR § 17-1700.1-2 (formatting altered).  "In 
a transaction involving a life estate, a transfer of assets is FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 involved."  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, State
Medicaid Manual § 3258.9.  3 
A life estate is "the value of a property that is 
allocated between the life tenant and the remainderman."  HAR § 17-1700.1-2.  The life tenant is "a life estate holder who is 
entitled to certain property rights and the right to reside on 
the property for the duration of the holder's life or the life 
of another."  HAR § 17-1700.1-2.  "The life tenant:  (A) Owns 
the physical property for the duration of the life estate; 
(B) Has the right to possess, use, and obtain profits from the 
property; (C) Can sell his or her life estate interest; but 
(D) Cannot take any action concerning the interest of the 
remainderman."  HAR § 17-1725.1-34(f)(3) (formatting altered). 
The remainderman is "an individual who is given a 
remainder interest in a property which he or she will inherit upon the death of the life estate holder."  HAR § 17-1700.1-2.   
The remainderman:  (A) Has ownership interest in the 
physical property; (B) Does not have the right to possess 
and use the property until termination of life estate; and 
(C) Unless restricted by will or deed, is able to sell his 
or her interest in the physical property before the life estate interest expires but the market value of the 
remainder interest may be reduced as the sale is subject to 
life estate interest. 
 
HAR § 17-1725.1-34(f)(4) (formatting altered).  
The current value of the property shall be allocated 
between the life tenant and the remainderman by determining 
the present worth of their respective interest using the 
Life Estate and Remainderman Interest Table (26 C.F.R. 
§ 20.2031- 7 and 49 FR Vol. 49 No. 93/5- 11-84), that 
corresponds to the age of the life tenant[.]

HAR § 17-1725.1-34(f)(2).  A transfer of a life estate "is for 
less than fair market value whenever the value of the 
transferred asset is greater than the value of the rights conferred by the life estate."  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid 
Services, State Medicaid Manual § 3258.9 (emphasis added). 
 2. Edward's and Florence's life estate 
   Here, Edward and Florence reserved a life estate in an undivided 0.0001% interest in and to the Property when they 
transferred the Property to the Trust by warranty deed.  Thus, 
the life estate existed independent of the Trust.  Florence in 
2014, and Edward in 2015, applied for Medicaid assistance to pay 
for their long-term care.  Since Florence and Edward transferred 
their life estate to the Kagamis in 2012, the transfer of that 
asset falls within the five-year look-back period.  HAR § 17-
1725.1-51(a).  DHS was thus obligated to determine whether the 
transfer of Florence's and Edward's life estate to the Kagamis was for less than fair market value.  See generally 42 U.S.C. 
§ 1396p(c)(1)(A); HAR § 17-1725.1-51(a).  The dispute in this case centers around the phrase "ten-thousandth (0.0001 or 
1/10,000) interest in and to" the Property.  (Formatting 
altered.) 
 In applying for Medicaid assistance to pay for her 
long-term care, Florence represented the value of her life estate in the Property as worth $8.06 by calculating as follows: FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
14 
 $546,000.00  Property tax assessed value  
x  .29526   Life estate factor  
$161,211.96  Full value  
 x  0.0001  Percentage of interest in 
Property  
$16.12 Adjusted life estate value  
  ÷       2         Adjusted for joint life tenant 
with Edward 
$8.06 Florence's proposed life estate 
value 
 
Accounting for his life estate factor, Edward similarly 
calculated the value of his life estate at $7.04.  Apparently 
taking issue with these low valuations, the Hearing Officer 
considered the circumstances surrounding the transfers of the 
Property to assess the value of Florence's and Edward's life 
estate. 
As to using the tax assessed value as the "fair 
market" value, the Hearing Officer found that "[b]ecause [the Property] was sold for $700,000.00, there [was] no reason for 
using the tax assessed value of $546,000."  The Fujimoris do not 
appear to challenge the Hearing Officer's use of the sales 
price.  They merely assert that "[e]ven when using the $700,000 
fair market value as a starting point, [Florence] could only 
have received, at most, $10.33, and [Edward] could only have 
received, at most, $9.02." 
As to reducing the value of the life estate to 0.0001% 
of the full value, the Hearing Officer found that "only [Florence and Edward] had an interest in the life estate of [the FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
15 
  Property] and that no other person or persons received an 
undivided interest in the Life Estate of [the Property]."  
Although the Fujimoris challenged this finding, they fail to 
cite to where evidence was adduced showing that there was another life tenant holding a life estate in the Property.
 
Indeed, the record shows that the Fujimoris 
transferred the Property into the Trust with Son as trustee, 
reserving a life estate, albeit in a 0.0001% interest to the 
Property.  The deed to the Property shows only Florence and 
Edward as reserving a life estate, no one else.  Significantly, 
there was no evidence in the record that Florence and Edward's 
right to enjoy the entire Property as life tenants was somehow 
diminished or restricted by holding a life estate in only a 0.0001% interest to the Property.  And, it seems implausible 
that the Kagamis would purchase the Property for $700,000 
encumbered by a life estate in the other 99.9999% interest in 
the Property.  Thus, the Hearing Officer's finding that only 
Florence and Edward held a life estate to the Property was not 
clearly erroneous.   
The Hearing Officer further found that one of the 
reasons for establishing a life estate in 0.0001% interest of the Property was explained by the Fujimoris' attorney as, 
most importantly, the value of your life estate share is so 
small that even if the law were to change to accommodate the Attorney General' s new position regarding collecting 
liens against life estates, you could buy out that piece of 
life estate and pay off the Medicaid lien for under $50 in 
most cases – no matter how big the lien amount is. FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
16 
   The Fujimoris did not challenge this finding, and this finding 
goes directly to the purpose of establishing such a life estate 
in the Property–to evade a large Medicaid lien.
 
The Fujimoris' application of a 0.0001% adjustment in 
calculating the value of their life estate was a mathematical manipulation of the Medicaid program, a program meant to help 
the most needy in our community.  See Fournier, 170 N.E.3d at 
1164; Est. of Scheidecker, 490 P.3d at 91.  DHS was duty bound 
to uphold the law and fulfill the purposes of the Medicaid 
program and, thus, was obligated to assess the true nature of 
the Fujimoris' life estate.  HRS § 346-14(7) (2015) (providing 
that DHS shall "[a]dminister the medical assistance programs for 
eligible public welfare and other medically needy individuals by establishing standards, eligibility, and health care 
participation rules, . . . systems to monitor recipient and 
provider compliance, and assuring compliance with federal 
requirements to maximize federal financial participation").   
Accordingly, we hold that the circuit court did not 
err by affirming the Hearing Officer's decision because, based 
on the circumstances in this particular case, Edward and Florence improperly attempted to diminish the value of their 
life estate to qualify as individuals in need of Medicaid 
assistance. FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
17 
 B. Reimbursement For Assistance Pending The Decision 
The Fujimoris argue that because DHS erred in denying 
Florence's benefits, she need not reimburse DHS "for any aid 
paid pending the August 10, 2016 Administrative Hearing Decision in her case." 
HAR § 17-1703.1-17(a) provides that "[a]id paid 
pending a hearing decision from the date aid paid pending begins 
through the ninetieth (90
th) day shall be recoverable by the 
department if the department's action is sustained."  DHS identified the period pending as June 1, 2016 through August 10, 
2016, a little over two months. 
The Hearing Officer calculated the value of Florence's 
life estate as follows: 
$700,000.00  Property sales price  
x  .29526   Florence 's life estate factor  
$206,682.00  Full value of Florence 's interest  
  ÷       2       Adjusted for joint life tenant with 
Edward 
$103,341.00  Value of Florence's life estate in 
2012 
 
Based on this calculation, the Hearing Officer concluded that 
Florence "was not fairly compensated for her [0.0001%] undivided interest in a life estate" of the Property, and that the fair 
market value of her life estate in 2012 was $103,341.00, and not 
$8.06.  Based on the record, this calculation fairly reflects 
the value of Florence's life estate in the ($700,000.00) 
Property, and was not clearly erroneous. FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
18 
   Because Florence transferred her life estate within 
the look-back period, the life estate value exceeded $2,000.00, 
and the aid paid pending the decision was within ninety days of 
the decision, we hold that the circuit court did not err by affirming the Hearing Officer's decision requiring Florence to 
return the Medicaid assistance paid pending the administrative 
hearing decision. 
C. Failure To Provide Information 
  Edward does not dispute that DHS requested 
information, and that he refused to provide the requested 
information.  Edward, instead, argues that "[b]ecause assets in 
the Fujimori Trust did not belong to [him, DHS] should not have 
denied his application for benefits for failure to provide information regarding the amount of assets belonging to the 
Trust."  Edward insists that the information requested was 
"irrelevant" because "the Trust's bank accounts are not part of 
the universe of assets to be considered," and that DHS "does not 
have a right to request information regarding assets in the 
Fujimori Trust." 
  Trusts and life estates may affect an individual's Medicaid eligibility.  HAR §§ 17-1725.1-18 and 17-1725.1-34(f).  
As an applicant seeking Medicaid assistance to pay for his or 
her long-term care, "[a]n individual shall apply for and develop 
potential sources of assets, when applicable."  HAR § 17-1725.1-
10(a).  And DHS "shall deny or terminate medical assistance when FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 an individual fails to . . . [c]ooperate in providing accurate 
and complete information or verification[.]"  HAR § 17-1725.1-
10(g)(2). 
  Importantly, "[r]eal property which is considered the home or usual place of residence of the individual is generally 
exempt from consideration as a countable asset," subject to some 
terms and exceptions.  HAR § 17-1725.1-36(a).  Cash in a bank 
account, however, "shall be considered in the personal reserve" 
of the individual.  HAR § 17-1725.1-17(2).  In a revocable 
trust, "[t]he corpus of the trust is considered an available 
asset[.]"  HAR § 17-1725.1-18(d)(1).  In an irrevocable trust, 
there are circumstances under which funds can be considered an 
available asset.  HAR § 17-1725.1-18(e).  A trust is irrevocable only when its "term and conditions cannot be amended under any 
circumstances, including a court order."  HAR § 17-1700.1-2.     
Here, the Trust transferred the Property and Edward 
transferred his life estate to the Kagamis in 2012, effectively 
converting these assets into cash.  This conversion occurred 
within the five-year look-back period of Edward's 2015 
application for Medicaid assistance. 
Accordingly, at the time of his application, DHS was 
obligated to determine whether the cash was an asset available to Edward.  HRS § 346-14(7); HAR §§ 17-1700.1-2, 17-1725.1-
17(2), 17-1725.1-18(d)(1).  Necessary to that determination 
would be an inquiry as to whether the Trust was irrevocable for FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 /s/ Keith K. Hiraoka purposes of qualifying for Medicaid assistance and whether the 
life estate was transferred for less than its fair market value.  
HAR §§ 17-1700.1-2, 17-1725.1-18(e).  Thus, the circumstances 
surrounding the 2012 transfer of the Property and Edward's life estate were relevant to determining whether Edward was eligible 
for Medicaid assistance.     
We thus hold that the circuit court did not err in 
affirming the Hearing Officer's decision denying Edward's 
application for failing "to provide requested updated 
information related to the status of assets in the Fujimori 
Trust, as required by HAR § 17-1725.1-10(g)." 
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the circuit court's 
April 26, 2017 "Order Affirming Administrative Hearing Decisions Dated August 10, 2016 and September 13, 2016" and May 11, 2017 
"Judgment on Appeal of Hearing Officer's Decisions."
