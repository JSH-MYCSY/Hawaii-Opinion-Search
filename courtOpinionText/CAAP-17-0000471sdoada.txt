Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
DARRYL THOMAS,
Defendant-Appellant,
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CRIMINAL NO. 14-1-1031)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Chan, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Darryl Thomas (Thomas) appeals from
the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence, filed May 24, 2017,
(Judgment) in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit
court).1
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai# i (State) indicted
Thomas on Count I, Attempted Murder in the Second Degree under
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 705-500 (2014), 707-701.5
(2014), and 706-656 (2014); Count II, Burglary in the First
Degree under HRS § 708-810(1)(c) (2014); and Count III,
Terroristic Threatening in the Second Degree under HRS § 707-717
(2014).  On March 7, 2017, after a jury-waived trial, the circuit
court found Thomas guilty of the lesser included offense of
1 The Honorable Sherri L. Iha presiding.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
Attempted Assault in the First Degree in Count I (HRS §§ 705-500
& 707-710)  (2014), and guilty as charged of Burglary in the
First Degree in Count II and Terroristic Threatening in the
Second Degree in Count III.  The circuit court denied the State's
motion for extended sentencing and sentenced Thomas to ten years
of imprisonment for Count I, to run consecutively with ten years
of imprisonment for Count II and concurrently with one year of
imprisonment for Count III.2
On appeal, Thomas raises a single point of error,
contending that the circuit court abused its discretion in
sentencing Thomas to a term of imprisonment for Count II
consecutive to the term of imprisonment for Count I.3
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve Thomas'
point of error as follows:
A sentencing judge generally has broad discretion in
imposing a sentence. The applicable standard of review for
sentencing or resentencing matters is whether the court
committed plain and manifest abuse of discretion in its
decision. Factors which indicate a plain and manifest abuse
of discretion are arbitrary or capricious action by the
judge and a rigid refusal to consider the defendant's
contentions. And, generally, to constitute an abuse it must
appear that the court clearly exceeded the bounds of reason
or disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the
substantial detriment of a party litigant.
2 The Judgment incorrectly reflects that Thomas was convicted of HRS §
707-720.  It should reflect a conviction for HRS § 707-710.  As set forth
infra, we remand this case for correction of the error in the Judgment.
3 The Reply Brief was submitted pro se and alleges additional points of
error related to the circuit court's consideration of the presentence
diagnosis and report and the medical testimony presented at trial.  These
issues are deemed waived because issues on appeal may only be raised in the
Opening Brief.  State v. Mark, 123 Hawai #i 205, 230, 231 P.3d 478, 503 (2010)
(citing In re Hawaiian Flour Mills, Inc., 76 Hawai #i 1, 14 n. 5, 868 P.2d 419,
432 n. 5 (1994) (holding that arguments raised for the first time in the reply
briefs on appeal were deemed waived)).  This waiver is not absolute and is
subject to the court's inherent authority to address plain error and without
prejudice to a Hawai #i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40 (2013) petition
for post-conviction relief in conjunction with claims of ineffective
assistance from trial and/or appellate counsel.  See State v. Mark, 123
Hawai#i at 230 (noting that appellate courts may address plain error raised in
reply brief); Briones v. State, 74 Haw. 442, 459, 848 P.2d 966, 975 (1993)
(explaining that issues of ineffective assistance of both trial and appellate
counsel may be raised in a HRPP Rule 40 petition for post-conviction relief,
in certain situations).

State v. Kong, 131 Hawaii 94, 101, 315 P.3d 720, 727 (2013)
(citation omitted).#
Thomas contends that the circuit court abused its
discretion by sentencing him to consecutive terms of imprisonment
(rather than the requested probation or two concurrent ten-year
terms) for two reasons: (1) consecutive sentences are
disproportionate to the crime and, (2) the circuit court failed
to address "statutory factors, mitigating factors and the
testimony presented at trial, whether or not there was an
extensive criminal history, the failure to benefit from previous
court supervision, [and] that there was one victim in one
incidents [sic] involved in these offenses." 
"A sentencing court has discretion to order multiple
terms of imprisonment to run concurrently or consecutively."  Id. 
(citing HRS § 706-668.5(1) (2008)).  HRS § 706-668.5(2) (2014)
states: "The court, in determining whether the terms imposed are
to be ordered to run concurrently or consecutively, shall
consider the factors set forth in section 706-606."  HRS §
706-606 (2014) provides:
The court, in determining the particular sentence to be
imposed, shall consider:
(1) The nature and circumstances of the offense and the
history and characteristics of the defendant;
(2) The need for the sentence imposed:
(a) To reflect the seriousness of the offense, to
promote respect for law, and to provide just
punishment for the offense;
(b) To afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;
(c) To protect the public from further crimes of the
defendant; and
(d) To provide the defendant with needed educational
or vocational training, medical care, or other
correctional treatment in the most effective manner;
(3) The kinds of sentences available; and
(4) The need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among
defendants with similar records who have been found guilty
of similar conduct.
The Supreme Court of Hawai #i stated:
"Absent clear evidence to the contrary, it is presumed that
a sentencing court will have considered all factors before
imposing concurrent or consecutive terms of imprisonment
under HRS § 706-606."  Kong, 131 Hawai #i at 102, 315 P.3d at
728 (internal brackets, quotation marks, and citation
omitted).  However, "circuit courts must state on the record
at the time of sentencing the reasons for imposing a
consecutive sentence."  Id.  (internal quotation marks and
citation omitted; emphasis in original).  Even if the
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
sentencing court addresses the HRS § 706-606 factors, and
states its reasons on the record, the sentence must be
vacated if the court relies upon any improper factors.  See
[State v.] Mikasa, 111 Hawai #i [1,] 9, 135 P.3d [1044,] 1052
(2006). 
State v. Barrios, 139 Hawai# i 321, 333, 389 P.3d 916, 928 (2016).
Therefore, in the absence of clear evidence to the
contrary, if the circuit court states on the record reasons for
imposing consecutive sentences it is presumed that the circuit
court considered the proper statutory factors.  An imposition of
consecutive sentences is not an abuse of discretion if "the trial
court did not clearly exceed the bounds of reason or disregard
rules or principles of law or practice to [the defendant's]
substantial detriment."  State v. Loa, 83 Hawai# i 335, 356, 926
P.2d 1258, 1279 (1996).
A consecutive sentence rises to the level of
constitutionally cruel and unusual punishment, and is thus
"disproportionate," if: 
in the light of developing concepts of decency and fairness,
the prescribed punishment is so disproportionate to the
conduct proscribed and is of such duration as to shock the
conscience of reasonable persons or to outrage the moral
sense of the community.
Id. at 357, 926 P.2d 1280 (quoting State v. Kumukau, 71 Haw. 218,
226-227, 787 P.2d 682, 687 (1990)).
Thomas' contention that the imposition of consecutive
sentences was disproportionate is without merit.  As required in
Barrios, the circuit court stated the reasons for its decision
when imposing consecutive sentences:
"Mr. Thomas, you know, the Court has no doubt that you are
remorseful for your actions.  However, the trust that was
put in you and how you handled it and your persistent, you
know, going back to the residence and, you know, the facts
of the actual case itself are so egregious, the threatened
harm, you know, the history of delinquency, and, you know,
the Court cannot find that the circumstances are not likely
to recur if you're out again."
The circuit court denied the State's request for extended
sentencing as disproportionate, but granted the State's request
for consecutive terms to protect the public from further crimes
of the defendant in accordance with HRS § 706-606(2)(c).  The
circuit court is thus presumed to have considered all of the
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
proper statutory factors.
Thomas argues that the imposition of consecutive
sentences for two crimes related to the same series of events is
disproportionate.  We reject this argument.  The number of
victims and incidents is not one of the HRS § 706-606 factors and
a circuit court's consideration of those factors is improper. 
State v. Long, No. CAAP-16-0000014, 2018 WL 332982, at *4 (Haw.
App. Jan. 9, 2018) (SDO) (overturning a circuit court's
imposition of consecutive sentences because the circuit court
improperly considered the non-statutory factor: "the fact that
the offenses involved two separate victims in two separate
incidents"), cert. denied, 2018 WL 1957138 (Haw. Apr. 26, 2018).
Thus, in this case, the fact that Thomas was convicted of two
different crimes attendant to the same incident did not preclude
the imposition of consecutive sentences for the purposes of
deterrence.  Thomas admitted that after his arrest he threatened
to return to finish the assault and kill both the victim and her
family.  The circuit court properly applied the HRS § 706-606
factors when it found that a single ten-year term of imprisonment
was insufficient deterrence and imposed a consecutive sentence
for the explicit purpose of preventing Thomas from engaging in
similar acts in the future.
Thomas states that the circuit court's imposition of
consecutive sentences for two crimes related to the same series
of events circumvents the legislature's authority to set the
maximum sentence for an offense.  We disagree.  In HRS §
706-668.5 (Supp. 2017),  the legislature expressly provided the
courts with authority to designate that multiple terms of4
4 HRS § 706-668.5 (Supp. 2017) states in relevant part:
 (1) If multiple terms of imprisonment are imposed on a
defendant, whether at the same time or at different times, or if a
term of imprisonment is imposed on a defendant who is already
subject to an unexpired term of imprisonment, the terms may run
concurrently or consecutively.  Multiple terms of imprisonment run
concurrently unless the court orders or the statute mandates that
the terms run consecutively.  
(2) The court, in determining whether the terms imposed are to be
ordered to run concurrently or consecutively, shall consider the factors
set forth in section 706-606.  
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
imprisonment run consecutively, so long as the court considers
the HRS § 706-606 factors.  The Supreme Court of Hawai #i,
interpreting HRS § 706-668.5, has stated that: "[d]iscretionary
use of consecutive sentences is properly imposed in order to
deter future criminal behavior of the defendant, to insure public
safety, and to assure just punishment for the crimes committed." 
State v. Tauiliili, 96 Hawai #i 195, 199, 29 P.3d 914, 918 (2001). 
Thus, the circuit court has authority to impose consecutive
sentences.
Finally, Thomas misconstrues Barrios when he argues
that the circuit court failed to state on the record the
"statutory factors, mitigating factors and the testimony
presented at trial, whether or not there was an extensive
criminal history, the failure to benefit from previous court
supervision, [and] that there was one victim in one incidents
[sic] involved in these offenses."  The Hawai #i Supreme Court in
Barrios stated:
"the sentencing court is not required to articulate and
explain its conclusions with respect to every factor listed
in HRS § 706–606 [,]" but rather must "articulate its
reasoning only with respect to those factors it relies on in
imposing consecutive sentences."
  
Barrios, 139 Hawai# i at 336, 389 P.3d at 931 (quoting Kong, 131
Hawai#i at 102, 315 P.3d at 728).
Thomas acknowledges that the circuit court considered
some of the HRS § 706-606 factors on the record when imposing the
consecutive sentence.  Thomas provides no evidence that the
circuit court did not consider the required HRS § 706-606 factors
in making its decision, and Thomas presents no evidence or
implication that the circuit court considered an improper or
extraneous factor when imposing Thomas' consecutive sentences.
See, e.g., Barrios, 139 Hawai #i at 338, 389 P.3d at 933 (noting
that it is improper for a court to rely on a defendant's refusal
to admit guilt as a factor in imposing sentence); Mikasa, 111
Hawai#i at 9, 135 P.3d at 1052 (noting that it is improper for a
court to consider evidence of gang association in imposing
sentence).  Thus, we reject Thomas' argument that the circuit
6NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
court failed to consider the proper statutory factors in imposing
a consecutive sentence in this case.
Accordingly, we conclude that the circuit court did not
err in sentencing Thomas to consecutive terms of imprisonment for
Counts I and II.  The "Judgment of Conviction and Sentence"
entered on May 24, 2017, in the Circuit Court of the First
Circuit is affirmed, except that we remand the case to correct
the error in the Judgment as referenced in footnote 2 herein.
