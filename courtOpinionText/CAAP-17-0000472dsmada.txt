(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Ginoza and Chan, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Defendant-Appellant Robert A.
 
Farland's (Appellant) September 14, 2017 Motion for Voluntary
 
Dismissal, it appears that (1) the appeal was docketed on 
August 7, 2017; (2) Appellant seeks to dismiss the appeal,
 pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 42(b);1
 and
(3) there is good cause to grant the motion.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion is
 
granted and the appeal is dismissed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, October 5, 2017. 
Presiding Judge
 
Associate Judge

1/
 Appellant seeks to dismiss the appeal, in part, because the court-
appointed commissioner in the underlying foreclosure action, Civil
No. 15-1-0038(2), "requested that Appellant move to dismiss this appeal." The
 commissioner filed a memorandum denying that he requested Appellant to dismiss
the appeal.
