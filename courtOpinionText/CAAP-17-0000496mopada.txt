I. BACKGROUND 
This appeal stems from foreclosure proceedings 
involving a reverse mortgage on a home located on # Ôpe #ape#a Road, 
in Kurtistown, in the County of Hawai
#i (Property).  On October 
19, 2009, Namahoe executed a promissory note in the maximum 
principal amount of $189,000 in favor of James B. Nutter & Co. 
(Nutter) and its successors and assigns (Note), along with a Home 
Equity Conversion Loan Agreement (Loan Agreement) and an attached Repair Rider to Loan Agreement (Repair Rider).
3  The exhibits to 
the Note indicated that the "principal limit" was $67,536.00, 
2 The Honorable Greg K. Nakamura presided. 
3 The Repair Rider provided, inter alia : 
I. Lender's Promises 
A. The Lender shall set aside $750.00 from the initial Principal Limit under the Loan Agreementto be used for the purpose of bringing theProperty up to the property standards requiredby the Secretary by repairing:The hall and carport ceiling shows evidence of waterstains due to roof leak[.]  The Front stair rail showed evidence of water rot.  All to be repaired.

with Namahoe receiving an "advance" of $52,462.48, with a $750.00 
"line of credit" designated for repairs, and the balance of the $67,536.00 going to closing costs and servicing fee set asides. The Note was secured by a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage 
(Reverse Mortgage), which was recorded on November 2, 2009, in 
the Office of the Assistant Registrar of the Land Court of the 
State of Hawai# i (Registrar).  
On March 6, 2012, Nutter filed a foreclosure complaint 
and summons against Namahoe and the United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
4 (Complaint), and an 
accompanying lis pendens in the Circuit Court.  The Complaint 
alleged that Namahoe "defaulted in the observance and performance 
of the terms, covenants and conditions by failing to repair the property as required by the [Repair Rider] in a timely manner."  The Complaint alleged further that Namahoe was given written notice that failure to timely repair per the Repair Rider "required immediate payment in full of all outstanding principal and accrued interest due on the loan," and that Namahoe failed to so pay.  Attached to the Complaint was a copy of the Note, Loan Agreement with attached Repair Rider, and Mortgage. 
A Declaration re Attempted Service of Complaint was 
filed on May 7, 2012, by Civil Process Server Robert A. Estacion 
(Estacion) stating that Estacion attempted thrice to serve the 
4 On June 28, 2012, HUD filed a disclaimer of interest in the 
Property. 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Complaint on Namahoe at the Property, but that Namahoe "could not 
be located for personal service of the Complaint." 
On August 28, 2012, Nutter filed an Ex Parte Motion for 
First Extension of Time to Serve Complaint (Motion to Extend 
Service Time).  Counsel's attached Declaration stated that Nutter sent out Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, apparently to the U.S. Postal Service (Post Office), for both Namahoe's post 
office box and the physical address.  The Post Office returned 
the FOIA request regarding the post office box and provided the physical address.  With respect to the physical address, the FOIA request was returned indicating "[n]o such address," presumably indicating that the Post Office had no records concerning the address.  The Declaration stated further that Nutter "conducted a skip trace on [Namahoe] that returned the property address as his current address," and that Nutter was "attempting to send certified mail to the property address and the post office box." Copies of the FOIA requests/responses and a LexisNexis Accurint report, which counsel apparently referred to as the "skip trace," were attached to the motion.  The court granted the motion, extending the time to serve the Complaint from September 6, 2012, until March 6, 2013.  
On November 13, 2012, Estacion filed a Return and 
Acknowledgment of Service, indicating personal service of the Summons and Complaint on Namahoe on November 9, 2012, at the Property.  The Acknowledgment of Service appears to contain 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
  According to the attached Certificate of Service, the 
Motion for Summary Judgment and the Notice of Hearing were mailed 
to Namahoe at the Property.  The Notice of Hearing stated that a hearing would be held at 8:30 a.m. in the Circuit Court's courtroom at 777 Kilauea Avenue, in Hilo; no hearing date was included in the Notice of Hearing, although a date was written on the first page of the Motion for Summary Judgment.  A November 16, 2011 Notice of Intent to Foreclose and an April 6, 2012 debt collection notice, both attached in support of the motion, indicated that they were mailed to Namahoe's post office box in Hilo, rather than the Property address. Namahoe's signature, along with the date and time of "11-9-12 
10:00 A.M."  
On May 20, 2013, Nutter filed a Motion for Summary 
Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure Against All Defendants on 
Complaint Filed March 6, 2012 (
Motion for Summary Judgment).  The 
motion stated, inter alia: 
[Namahoe] defaulted in the observance and performance
of the terms, covenants and conditions by failing to repair
the property, as required by the [Repair Rider], in a timelymanner.  A true and correct copy of the approval by [HUD]for immediate payment in full of all outstanding principaland accrued interest as required by paragraph 7(b)(iii) ofthe Note is attached hereto. . . .  Written notice was givento [Namahoe] that because of the failure to repair theproperty as required by the [Repair Rider] in a timelymanner [Nutter] required immediate payment in full of alloutstanding principal and accrued interest due on the loan. A true and correct copy of this notice with all personal andconfidential information redacted is attached hereto . . . . However, despite said notice the default was not cured andthe loan has not been paid off.  Consequently, [Nutter]exercised its option under the terms and covenants of theNote and Mortgage to declare the entire unpaid principalbalance of the loan, together with interest immediately dueand payable[.] 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On June 25, 2013, a one-minute hearing was held on 
Nutter's Motion for Summary Judgment, with Nutter's attorney 
appearing by telephone and no other appearances noted; the motion was granted.  On July 2, 2013, the Circuit Court entered the [FOFs, COLs] and Order Granting [Nutter's] Motion for Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure Against All Defendants on 
Complaint Filed March 6, 2012 (Order Granting Summary Judgment), 
as well as a Judgment on the Order Granting Summary Judgment 
(Foreclosure Judgment). 
On July 24, 2013, Foreclosure Commissioner Michael W. 
Moore (Moore) filed a Motion for Leave to Waive Open Houses.  The 
attached Declaration states: 
2.  On July 18, 2013, I visited the subject property
in Hawaiian Acres. . . .  I knocked on the front door, but
there was no response. . . .  It appeared that someone was residing in the house. 
3.  . . . I found Defendant Namahoe's telephone number
in the phone book and called.  Mr. Namahoe answered.  He seemed unaware there was a foreclosure proceeding againsthim.  He said he is 70 years old, has no car, so he can'tcheck his post office box in Hilo where he receives hismail.  He told me no one can take his house because he owns it.  I explained to him it was my responsibility to sell hisproperty at public auction. 
4.  He became quite upset.  He said he has nowhere 
else to live, no family or friends he can stay with.  He said his income is only $700 a month, and he can barelyafford to buy food.  He told me that he would shoot the next person to come to his house so he could go to jail and getfed. 
5.  Based on these circumstances, I believe Mr.
Namahoe will not cooperate in conducting open houses of theproperty, and that any person who attempts to enter his homewould risk injury, possibly serious injury. 
(Emphasis added).  
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Also on July 24, 2013, Moore mailed a Notice of Hearing 
to Namahoe's Hilo post office box.  The Circuit Court's October 
2, 2013 Order Granting Commissioner's Motion for Leave to Waive Open Houses states that the motion "came on for hearing before this Court on August 29, 2013, with the Commissioner present and [Nutter] having filed a statement of no opposition . . . and no other parties appearing." 
The Commissioner's Report on Sale of Property indicates 
that the property was sold at public auction on November 13, 2013, with the highest bid being presented by Nutter.  The attached Certificate of Service, dated November 25, 2013, contains the following addendum: 
NOTE:  We do not have a current mailing address for 
[Namahoe].  His last known mailing address was P.O. Box 
4686, HILO HI 96721.  By return mail notice dated 10/4/13, the U.S. Postal Service advised that Mr. Namahoe's post office box has been closed and they are unable to forward his mail. 
On February 11, 2014, the Circuit Court entered an 
Order Approving Report of Commissioner, Confirming Commissioner's 
Sale of Property at Public Auction, Directing Distribution of Proceeds and for a Writ of Ejectment, along with a corresponding 
Judgment, Writ of Ejectment, and Notice of Entry (Confirmation 
Judgment).  A Return of Service as to Writ of Ejectment was filed 
on June 23, 2014, indicating personal service on Namahoe.  
On January 3, 2017, Namahoe filed an HRCP Rule 60(b) 
Motion for Relief from [Foreclosure Judgment] (  Rule 60(b) 
Motion).  The motion challenged the substantive basis for the 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
foreclosure, averring that Nutter was not entitled to pursue a 
reverse mortgage foreclosure based upon failure to timely repair, and further, that Namahoe made the repairs set forth in the Repair Rider but that, although he recalled two separate inspections of the Property by Nutter's agents, neither inspector checked the repairs to the roof and neither indicated there was any problem with the repairs. 
The Rule 60(b) Motion and Namahoe's attached 
Declaration also challenged whether Namahoe had notice of the 
foreclosure proceedings, stating, inter alia:  
7. I do not remember the sheriff, [Estacion]
handing me the foreclosure Complaint on November 9, 2012. 
Not [sic] do I recall signing any paper that I received theComplaint.  I would not have understood it anyway.   
8. My first memory about the foreclosure was a
telephone call from an attorney who said he wanted toinspect my house and property because it was his job to sellmy house at a foreclosure action.  I was shocked!  I did not know of any foreclosure.  How come no one wrote me,telephoned me, or came to the house.  I was always therebecause I had no car, very little money and only a fewneighbors and relatives.  I had to hitch rides from my housein remote Hawaiian Acres to shop for food and collect mymail at my post office box in Hilo.  I was angry and upsetand never heard again from the attorney. 
In the Rule 60(b) Motion, Namahoe further argued that 
Nutter committed fraud and fraud upon the court in pursuing the 
improper foreclosure, and requested the court take judicial notice of the records and files in separate allegedly improper foreclosure proceedings brought by Nutter against a different 
defendant (Domingo Foreclosure), as well as the records and files 
8   NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
in a separate suit brought by Namahoe and the defendant in the 
Domingo Foreclosure (Wrongful Foreclosure Action).5 
Nutter opposed the Rule 60(b) Motion, arguing that: 
(1) it was untimely and Namahoe failed to establish a meritorious
claim or defense; (2) Namahoe's fraud allegations were unsupported; (3) the Foreclosure Judgment was not void; (4) Namahoe waived all claims against Nutter related to the foreclosure in exchange for $5,000; and (5) the Property had already been sold to a third party.  Namahoe filed a reply to Nutter's opposition, contesting Nutter's first four arguments.  
A hearing on the Rule 60(b) Motion was held on February 
28, 2017, wherein the Circuit Court orally denied the motion. The Circuit Court explained its ruling: 
[T]he Court will deny the motion to the extent that
the motion proceeds under Rule 60(b)(3), [because] the
motion is untimely.  More than one year passed between thetime the Judgment was filed on July 2nd, 2013, and the 
5 Pursuant to the parties' various requests herein, we take judicial
notice of the court records in these related cases, in accordance with Hawaii
Rules of Evidence ( HRE) Rule 201.  
The Domingo Foreclosure action, [Nutter] v. Faustino Dasalla 
Domingo [ Domingo ], was initiated in the Circuit Court on April 19, 2012, in
Civil No. 12-1-0226.  The Circuit Court proceedings in the Domingo Foreclosure
concluded with an August 10, 2015 Amended Judgment Superceding [Judgments],which dismissed Nutter's complaint against Domingo with prejudice and entereda money judgment in favor of Domingo.  Nutter filed an appeal in CAAP-15-0000659; the August 10, 2015 amended judgment against Nutter and in favor ofDomingo was affirmed.
The Wrongful Foreclosure action, [Domingo & Namahoe] v. [Nutter],
was initiated in the Circuit Court on July 5, 2016, in Civil No. 16-1-0249. The Circuit Court proceedings in the Wrongful Foreclosure action resulted invarious orders which were certified as final pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b). Appeals were filed by Nutter in CAAP-17-000324 and by Domingo and Namahoe inCAAP-17-0000859; a cross-appeal was filed in CAAP-17-0000859 by Robert M.
Ehrhorn, Jr. and Clay Chapman Iwamura Pulice & Nervell (collectively,  Clay 
Chapman,  the attorneys who represented Nutter in the Domingo Foreclosure, as
well as before the Circuit Court in this instant case ( i.e. , Nutter's 
foreclosure suit against Namahoe)).  CAAP-17-0000324 and CAAP-17-0000859 were 
consolidated for decision under CAAP-17-0000324. 
9  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
filing of the [Rule 60(b) Motion].
To the extent that proceeding under Rule 60(b)(4), the
motion is denied.  If we're talking about the notice issue,
Mr. Namahoe did not answer and provide a mailing address. And if you look at the note and mortgage, all notices wereto be given by mail to that 16-2218 Opeapea Road inKurtistown unless Mr. Namahoe designated otherwise.  And there's no indication that he designated another address tothe lender.  
Regarding the fraud on the court type theories I'm
going to think that that's more properly addressed in Civilnumber 16-1-249.  I see that case as being that independentaction that's mentioned under Rule 60(b).  And my impressionis that independent action is not really a 60(b) typemotion.  
There's still a fraud on the court type claim for
relief by Mr. Namahoe against Clay Chapman.  And Mr. Namahoe would have at least the opportunity to attempt to amend thepleadings in that case to state, let's say, clear claims forrelief against Nutter.  So that's what the Court's belief is. 
Namahoe's attorney asked if the court's ruling was with 
prejudice, and the court replied: 
On the (b)(3), (b)(4), I think so.But the [fraud on the] court stuff 
[] is still 
out there; right, in your other action.  Cause youstill have -- I think Mr. Namahoe still has a claim for relief against Nutter -- not Nutter -- ClayChapman.  And then you have the opportunity to amend. I'm thinking that you already have that actionalready, you know, so it's not as if you needed thisaction to address the [fraud on the] court issue[.] 6
On April 5, 2017, the Circuit Court entered the Order 
Denying Rule 60(b) Motion. 
On April 13, 2017, Namahoe filed an HRCP Rule 59(a) & 
(e) Motion for Amendment/Additional Evidence/Reconsideration of 
[Order Denying Rule 60(b) Motion] (Motion for Reconsideration). 
Namahoe requested formal discovery under HRCP Rule 26, and argued 
that denial of the Rule 60(b) Motion was an abuse of discretion and contrary to clear and convincing evidence, that 
6 The transcript reads "form of court stuff," but in context, it is
clear that the Circuit Court was referring to Namahoe's assertion that there
had been a fraud on the court. 
10 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 reconsideration was warranted on the basis of recently-decided 
supreme court opinion, Hungate v. Law Office of David B. Rosen, 139 Hawai# i 394, 391 P.3d 1 (2017).  The Motion for 
Reconsideration stated further that "[i]f in fact Namahoe was ever personally served on November 9, 2012, it was not legal or effective service since Namahoe was in the medical care of his daughter, Hernel Tisalona, and Bay Clinic, and incapacitated and unable to care for himself when allegedly served on November 9, 2012."  Nutter opposed the motion. 
On June 9, 2017, the Circuit Court entered the Order 
Denying Reconsideration, noting that Namahoe "did not file an answer to the Complaint and did not otherwise appear in the 
action."  Citing HRCP Rule 5(a), the court stated that Nutter 
"was not required to serve [Namahoe] with court filings other 
than the Complaint."  Accordingly, the court concluded that Nutter was not required to serve Namahoe with the Motion for Summary Judgment.  On this basis, the court found that Namahoe's production request to obtain evidence showing that Namahoe designated his post office box in Hilo as his mailing address "[did] not serve a useful purpose."  Finally, the court stated that Hungate did not provide a basis to alter or amend the Order Denying Rule 60(b) Motion. 
 Namahoe timely filed a Notice of Appeal. 
11 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
II. POINTS OF ERROR 
Namahoe raises two points of error on appeal, 
contending that the Circuit Court:  (1) erred in denying the Rule 
60(b) Motion because (a) the Foreclosure Judgment against Namahoe was obtained through fraud, misrepresentation, and misconduct that prevented Namahoe from fully and fairly presenting his case or a defense; (b) the Foreclosure Judgment was void; and (c) fraud on the court was committed by Nutter and/or its attorneys during the foreclosure proceeding; and (2) abused its discretion in denying the Motion for Reconsideration. III. APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
In general, 
[a] circuit court's decision on an HRCP Rule 60(b)
motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion: 
The trial court has a very large measure of discretion
in passing upon motions under HRCP Rule 60(b) and itsorder will not be set aside unless we are persuadedthat under the circumstances of the particular case,the court's refusal to set aside its order was an abuse of discretion. 
Haw. Hous. Auth. v. Uyehara, 77 Hawai #i 144, 147, 883 P.2d 
65, 68 (1994) (citations omitted). 
"The burden of establishing abuse of discretion in
denying an HRCP Rule 60(b) motion is on the appellant, and astrong showing is required to establish it."  Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 Hawai #i 153, 162, 80 P.3d 974, 983 (2003). 
PennyMac Corp. v. Godinez, 148 Hawai# i 323, 327, 474 P.3d 264, 
268 (2020) (brackets omitted). 
Notwithstanding this general rule, "under HRCP Rule 
60(b)(4), an order is 'void only if the court that rendered it 
lacked jurisdiction of either the subject matter or the parties or otherwise acted in a manner inconsistent with due process of 
12 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 law.'"  In re Haw. Elec. Co., 149 Hawai# i 343, 362-63, 489 P.3d 
1255, 1274-75 (2021) (quoting Int'l Savings & Loan Ass'n v. 
Carbonel, 93 Hawai# i 464, 473, 5 P.3d 454, 463 (App. 2000)). 
Accordingly, we review denial of an HRCP Rule 60(b)(4) motion 
de 
novo.  See id.
; Cvitanovich-Dubie v. Dubie, 125 Hawai# i 128, 139, 
254 P.3d 439, 450 (2011) (reviewing analogous family court rule 
de novo
). 
To be clear, we review denial of relief pursuant to 
HRCP Rule 60(b)(6), as well as the denial of relief pursuant to 
HRCP Rule 60(b)(3), under the abuse of discretion standard.  See Godinez, 148 Hawai# i at 327, 474 P.3d at 268; Dubie, 125 Hawai# i 
at 139, 146, 254 P.3d at 450, 457; Uyehara, 77 Hawai# i at 147, 
883 P.2d at 68. 
"A motion made pursuant to HRCP Rule 59(e) to alter or 
amend a judgment is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard.  An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial court exceeds the bounds of reason of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party."  Omerod v. Heirs of Kaheananui, 116 Hawai# i 239, 273, 172 P.3d 983, 1017 (2007) 
(citations, quotation marks, and brackets omitted). IV. DISCUSSION A. The HRCP Rule 60(b) Motion 
1. HRCP Rule 60(b)(3) Relief 
Namahoe challenges the Circuit Court's denial of relief 
pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b)(3) on the ground of untimeliness.  As 
13 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
set forth above, at the February 28, 2017 hearing on the Rule 
60(b) Motion, the Circuit Court stated, in relevant part:  "[T]he Court will deny the motion to the extent that the motion proceeds under Rule 60(b)(3) [because] the motion is untimely.  More than one year passed between the time the Judgment was filed on July 2nd, 2013, and the filing of the Motion for Relief."  HRCP Rule 60(b) states in relevant part: 
On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court
may relieve a party or a party's legal representative from a
final judgment, order, or proceeding for the followingreasons: . . . (3) fraud (whether heretofore denominatedintrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or othermisconduct of an adverse party. . . .  The motion shall be made within a reasonable time, and for reasons (1), (2), and(3) not more than one year after the judgment, order, orproceeding was entered or taken. . . .  This rule does not limit the power of a court to entertain an independentaction to relieve a party from a judgment, order, orproceeding, or to set aside a judgment for fraud upon thecourt. 
Namahoe argued that the "final act of this case" was 
when Nutter sold the Property to a third party for $70,000 on 
March 26, 2016, and therefore the January 3, 2017 Rule 60(b) Motion was timely filed under HRCP Rule 60(b)(3).  In support of his request for relief pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b)(3), however, Namahoe argued that Nutter's fraud, misrepresentation, and misconduct occurred when Nutter sought and obtained foreclosure against Namahoe on impermissible grounds.  Namahoe sought relief from the Foreclosure Judgment itself, which was entered on July 2, 2013, not from the sale of the Property to a third party after the Property's sale to Nutter was confirmed.  See Bank of Am., N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai# i 361, 371, 390 P.3d 1248, 1258 
14 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2017) (stating that judgment of foreclosure is immediately 
appealable) (citing HRS § 667-51(a)(1)).  Accordingly, we conclude that the Circuit Court did not clearly err in finding that the motion was untimely or abused its discretion when it denied Namahoe relief under HRCP Rule 60(b)(3) based on untimeliness. 
2. HRCP Rule 60(b)(4) Relief 
Namahoe challenges the Circuit Court's denial of relief 
pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b)(4), which permits a court to grant relief from a judgment that is void.  In the Rule 60(b) Motion, Namahoe argued that the Foreclosure Judgment was void because he was denied due process when Nutter mailed notices and "pleadings" to the Property when Nutter knew there was no mail delivery to the Property's address.  Namahoe's argument on appeal relies on Moore's declaration that Namahoe seemed unaware of the foreclosure proceedings.  Namahoe disregards Estacion's filing of the Return and Acknowledgment of Service, indicating personal service of the Complaint and Summons on Namahoe on November 9, 2012, at the Property. 
It is well settled that "'[i]n the sound interest of 
finality, the concept of a void judgment must be narrowly restricted.'"  Dubie, 125 Hawai# i at 141, 254 P.3d at 452 
(quoting Dillingham Inv. Corp. v. Kunio Yokoyama Tr., 8 Haw. App. 226, 233, 797 P.2d 1316, 1320 (1990)).  "[A] judgment is void only if the court that rendered it lacked jurisdiction of either 
15 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the subject matter or the parties or otherwise acted in a manner 
inconsistent with due process of law."  In re Haw. Elec., 149 Hawai# i at 362, 489 P.3d at 1274 (citation omitted).  Due 
process, in turn, requires notice reasonably calculated under the circumstances to apprise interested parties of the action and thus afford them an opportunity to defend.  See Calasa v. Greenwell, 2 Haw. App. 395, 399, 633 P.2d 553, 556 (1981) (citing Mullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank & Tr. Co., 339 U.S. 306 (1950)). 
Here, Namahoe's core argument that the Foreclosure 
Judgment is void – and therefore he was entitled to relief pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b)(4) – asserts that he was not properly notified of the foreclosure proceedings and therefore denied due process.  We first consider HRCP Rule 4, as Hawai# i courts have 
held that improper service of a complaint and summons is a violation of due process and deprives a court of jurisdiction over a defendant.  See In re Lease Cancellation of Smith, 68 Haw. 466, 471, 719 P.2d 397, 401 (1986); Wagner v. World Botanical Gardens, Inc., 126 Hawai# i 190, 196, 268 P.3d 443, 449 (App. 
2011).  HRCP Rule 4 provides, in relevant part: 
Rule 4. PROCESS. 
(a) Summons: Issuance.  Upon the filing of the
complaint the clerk shall forthwith issue a summons. 
Plaintiff shall deliver the complaint and summons forservice to a person authorized to serve process.  Uponrequest of the plaintiff separate or additional summonsshall issue against any defendants. 
. . . . 
(d)
 Same:  Personal service.   The summons and 
complaint shall be served together.  The plaintiff shall

furnish the person making service with such copies as
are necessary.  Service shall be made as follows: 
(1) Upon an individual other than an infant or an
incompetent person, (A) by delivering a copy of the summonsand of the complaint to the individual personally or in casethe individual cannot be found by leaving copies thereof atthe individual's dwelling house or usual place of abode withsome person of suitable age and discretion then residingtherein or (B) by delivering a copy of the summons and ofthe complaint to an agent authorized by appointment or bylaw to receive service of process. 
. . . . 
(g)
 Return.   The person serving the process shall make
proof of service thereof to the court promptly and in anyevent within the time during which the person served mustrespond to process.  When service is made by any personspecially appointed by the court, that a person shall makeaffidavit of such service. 
It appears from the record that Namahoe was personally 
served with the Summons and Complaint in accordance with HRCP 
Rule 4(a) & (d)(1)(A), and the Return and Acknowledgment of Service was filed with the Circuit Court in accordance with HRCP Rule (4)(g). 
As set forth in HRS § 634-22 (2016), the return of 
service by an authorized process server constitutes prima facie 
evidence of the events therein contained.

Builders, Ltd. v. Naval Ammunition Depot Lualualei Quarters, 
Inc., 48 Haw. 306, 313, 402 P.2d 440, 445 (1965) (construing predecessor statute).  While a party is entitled to challenge 
such a prima facie showing of service of process, see id., the

statute provides that "no further proof thereof shall be required 
unless either party desires to examine the sheriff, deputy sheriff, police officer, independent civil process server, or investigator making service, in which case the sheriff, deputy sheriff, police officer, independent civil process server or investigator shall be notified to appear for examination."  HRS § 634-22; see also SEC v. Internet Sols. for Bus. Inc., 509 F.3d 1161, 1163 (9th Cir. 2007) (holding "a signed return of service 
constitutes prima facie evidence of valid service which can be overcome only by strong and convincing evidence"); Hicklin v. 
Edwards, 226 F.2d 410, 414 (8th Cir. 1955) ("The rule is settled that the officer's return upon the summons imports verity which can be overcome only by strong and convincing evidence."); 4B 
Charles Alan Wright et al., Fed. Prac. & Proc. § 1130 (4th ed. 2015) ("return of service of the summons and the complaint is 
strong evidence of the facts stated therein"). 
Here, the Return and Acknowledgment of Service filed by 
Estacion
8 constitutes prima facie evidence that Namahoe was 
served and provided notice of the foreclosure proceedings.  See HRS § 634-22; Tropic Builders, 48 Haw. at 313, 402 P.2d at 445. To wit, the document avers that Namahoe was personally served with the Complaint, attached Exhibits, Foreclosure Mediation 
8 Namahoe does not contest that Estacion is an authorized process
server within the meaning of HRS §§ 634-21 & 634-22.  Estacion's filings
indicate that he is a "civil process server authorized to serve process in theCounty of Hawaii" and a "Sheriff/Police officer of the State of Hawaii." 
18  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Notice, Foreclosure Mediation Request, and Summons at the 
Property at 10:00 AM on November 9, 2012, and contains signatures of both Estacion and Namahoe. 
Neither Namahoe nor Estacion testified at the hearing 
on the Rule 60(b) Motion, and at no point did Namahoe request to examine Estacion per HRS § 634-22.  While Namahoe's Declaration appended to the Rule 60(b) Motion stated that he did not remember being served with the Complaint or signing the Acknowledgment of Service, the only other evidence offered in support of Namahoe's argument regarding service of the Complaint and Summons was the Commissioner's statement in his Declaration concerning the Motion for Leave to Waive Open Houses that Namahoe "seemed unaware there was a foreclosure proceeding against him."  These statements, without more, do not suffice to negate the substantial evidence that Namahoe was served and signed the Return and Acknowledgment of Service in the manner and at the date and time therein stated.
9 
In addition, Namahoe's principal assertion in the Rule 
60(b) Motion was that Nutter's mailing of notices and documents to him at the Property in the course of the foreclosure proceedings deprived him of notice that he was in effect being defaulted.  As Namahoe points out, at least by the time that Namahoe was served, Nutter was well aware that Namahoe's post 
9 We note that the complaint filed on behalf of Namahoe in the
Domingo-Namahoe Lawsuit states:  "The record reflects NAMAHOE was served and 
failed to file an answer or to make an appearance." 
19 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
office box was the only mailing address recognized by the Post 
Office, and that the Property was not a recognized mailing address, as Nutter had relied in part on those facts when seeking more time to serve Namahoe with the Complaint and Summons. However, as alluded to by the Circuit Court, HRCP Rule 5, governing Service and Filing of Pleadings and Other Papers 
subsequent to the original complaint, provides that "no service need be made on parties in default for failure to appear, except 
that pleadings asserting new or additional claims for relief against them shall be served upon them in the manner provided for service of summons in Rule 4 of these Rules."  HRCP Rule 5(a) (emphasis added).  The Circuit Court stated, regarding "the notice issue, Mr. Namahoe did not answer and provide a mailing address."  Even after Namahoe was contacted by Moore regarding the sale of the Property, and Moore's Notice of Hearing was mailed to Namahoe's post office box, Namahoe did not appear before the Circuit Court, assert that he was not properly served with the Complaint and Summons, or otherwise seek relief from the court. 
Under the circumstances here, we conclude that the 
Circuit Court did not err in denying Namahoe relief pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b)(4). 
3. HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) and/or Other Relief 
Namahoe contends that, additionally and/or 
alternatively, the Circuit Court abused its discretion when it 
20 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
denied him relief under HRCP Rule 60(b)(6).  Summarily stated, 
Namahoe argues that such relief was warranted by the alleged fraud on the court committed by Nutter and/or Clay Chapman when they prosecuted the foreclosure claim herein against Namahoe based on the same impermissible "repair-rider" grounds underlying the foreclosure against Domingo in the Domingo Foreclosure. 
The Hawai# i Supreme Court has recognized competing 
policy considerations generally favoring the finality of judgments, but nevertheless permitting parties to seek relief when a judgment has been procured through fraud.  See In Matsuura v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 102 Hawai# i 149, 157-58, 73 
P.3d 687, 695-96 (2003).  The court explained that "a judgment or final order should reflect the true merits of the case."  Id. at 157, 73 P.3d at 695.  In Matsuura, the supreme court reiterated 
that the one-year limitation applicable to, inter alia, HRCP Rule 60(b)(3) is not applicable when the fraud was committed on the 
court.  Id. at 158, 73 P.3d at 696. 
Fraud on the court applies only in "very unusual cases" 
and must rise above the ordinary species of fraud and misrepresentation.  See, e.g., Dubie, 125 Hawai# i at 144-46, 254 
P.3d at 455-57; Schefke v. Reliable Collection Agency, Ltd., 96 Hawai# i 408, 431, 32 P.3d 52, 75 (2001)).  In Dubie, the supreme 
court summarized the bounds of fraud-on-the-court relief pursuant to Rule 60(b)(6): 
This court has noted that, "[s]ince the remedy for
fraud on the court is far reaching, it only applies to very 
21 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
unusual cases involving 'far more than an injury to a single
litigant[,]' but rather, a 'corruption of the judicialprocess itself.'"  Schefke v. Reliable Collection Agency, Ltd., 96 Hawai #i 408, 431 n.42, 32 P.3d 52, 75 n.42 (2001)
(citation omitted) (some brackets in original); see alsoMatsuura v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 102 Hawai #i 149,
171, 73 P.3d 687, 709 (2003) (Acoba, J., concurring anddissenting) ("fraud on the court is not fraud on a party"). It is generally accepted that fraudulent conduct such asperjury or non-disclosure by a party, standing alone, isinsufficient to make out a claim for fraud on the court. See, e.g., Gleason v. Jandrucko, 860 F.2d 556, 559–60 (2dCir. 1988) ("[N]either perjury nor nondisclosure, by itself,amounts to anything more than fraud involving a singlelitigant."); Lockwood v. Bowles, 46 F.R.D. 625, 632–34(D.D.C. 1969) ("[W]here the court or its officers are notinvolved, there is no fraud upon the court within themeaning of [FRCP] Rule 60(b)."); see also 12 James Wm. Mooreet al., Moore's Federal Practice ¶ 60.21 [4][c] (3d ed.2010) ("Fraud on the court may not be established simply byshowing some misconduct by one of the parties to the suit. . . .  If fraud on the court were to be given a broad 
interpretation that encompassed fraudulent misconduct between the parties, ajudgment would always remain subject to challenge, and the one-year timelimitation applicable to motions based on Rule 60(b)(3) would bemeaningless.") (footnotes omitted).
. . . . 
Not any fraud connected with the presentation of
a case amounts to fraud on the court.  It must be a "direct assault on the integrity of the judicialprocess."  . . . 
Schefke, 96 Hawai #i at 431, 32 P.3d at 75 (citations 
omitted)[.] 
Dubie, 125 Hawai# i at 144-45, 254 P.3d at 455-56. 
In Matsuura, the supreme court recognized the HRCP Rule 
60(b) provision permitting a separate action based upon a fraud 
upon a court:  "This rule does not limit the power of a court to entertain an independent action to relieve a party from a judgment, order, or proceeding, or to set aside a judgment for fraud upon the court."  HRCP Rule 60(b); see Matsuura, 102 Hawai# i at 158, 73 P.3d at 696.  The court discussed the various 
means available to compensate parties for litigation misconduct and concluded that "[a]lthough both civil contempt and HRCP Rule 60(b) provide remedies to a party aggrieved by litigation 
22 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
misconduct, we believe that the existence of these remedies does 
not oblige us to limit victims of fraud solely to these established remedies, given the nature and effect of fraud."  Id. at 160, 73 P.3d at 698.  The court ultimately concluded that, notwithstanding the burdens and protracted nature of collateral proceedings, in certain circumstances, those factors may be 
outweighed by, inter alia, the objective of uncovering the truth, the preference for judgments on the merits, and the court's duty 
to discourage abusive litigation practices.  Id. at 162, 73 P.3d at 700. 
Here, the Circuit Court was fully apprised of the 
nature of Namahoe's contentions that, in more than one instance, Nutter and/or its attorneys proceeded to foreclose on the home of an elderly reverse mortgagor based on an alleged failure to complete arguably minor repairs, without a legal or factual basis for doing so.
10  However, by the time Namahoe filed the Rule 
60(b) Motion, the foreclosure proceedings were final and unappealable, Namahoe had been ejected from his home, and the Property had been purchased by Nutter and sold to a third party. Under these circumstances, without addressing the merits of Namahoe's fraud-on-the-court claim, the Circuit Court determined: 
Regarding the fraud on the court type theories I'm
going to think that that's more properly addressed in Civil
number 16-1-249.  I see that case as being that independent 
10 In this case, although there is no declaration or other evidence
in the record of the particular repairs Namahoe allegedly failed to complete,the sum total of the repairs specified in the Repair Rider was estimated tocost $750 (fully fundable by moneys set aside by Nutter). 
23 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
action that's mentioned under Rule 60(b).  And my impression
is that independent action is not really a 60(b) typemotion.  
There's still a fraud on the court type claim for
relief by Mr. Namahoe against Clay Chapman.  And Mr. Namahoe would have at least the opportunity to attempt to amend thepleadings in that case to state, let's say, clear claims forrelief against Nutter.  
The Circuit Court exercised its discretion and denied 
relief under HRCP Rule 60(b) without prejudice to Namahoe seeking 
appropriate relief in the separate action that had already been 
filed, i.e., the Wrongful Foreclosure Action.  We conclude that the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied 
Namahoe relief under HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) on this basis. 
B. Namahoe's Motion for Reconsideration Namahoe contends that the Circuit Court abused its 
discretion in denying his Motion for Reconsideration because he provided new evidence that Nutter knowingly failed to give Namahoe proper notice during the foreclosure proceedings and further because a supreme court decision published during the post-judgment proceedings supported reconsideration. 
"The purpose of a motion for reconsideration is to 
allow the parties to present new evidence and/or arguments that could not have been presented during the earlier adjudicated motion."  Amfac, Inc. v. Waikiki Beachcomber Inv. Co., 74 Haw. 85, 114, 839 P.2d 10, 27 (1992).  "Reconsideration is not a device to relitigate old matters or to raise arguments or evidence that could and should have been brought during the earlier proceeding."  Sousaris v. Miller, 92 Hawai# i 505, 513, 
24 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
993 P.2d 539, 547 (2000).  A party seeking reconsideration based 
on newly discovered evidence must establish that the evidence 
meets the following requirements:  "(1) it must be previously 
undiscovered even though due diligence was exercised; (2) it must 
be admissible and credible; (3) it must be of such a material and 
controlling nature as will probably change the outcome and not merely cumulative or tending only to impeach or contradict a witness."  Kawamata Farms, Inc. v. United Agri Products, 86 Hawai# i 214, 259, 948 P.2d 1055, 1100 (1997) (emphasis in 
original) (citations omitted).  
The record reveals that many of Namahoe's arguments on 
reconsideration concerning proper notice were previously made in conjunction with the Rule 60(b) Motion and there is no cogent argument as to why the "new" evidence and arguments concerning proper notice could not have been presented earlier.  Thus, we conclude that the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Motion for Reconsideration on this ground. 
Namahoe further argues that the Circuit Court abused 
its discretion in denying reconsideration of the Order Denying Rule 60(b) Motion based on the supreme court's decision in Hungate, which was published the day before the hearing on the Rule 60(b) Motion.  Namahoe argues that Hungate:  (1) raised the issue of notice in foreclosure cases effectively to the level of due process; (2) was instructive in its discussion concerning whether a mortgagee's attorney can be held liable for the failure 
25 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to comply with statutory requirements; and (3) effectively 
contravened the Circuit Court's decision to deny Namahoe relief under HRCP Rule 60(b)(3) on the basis of timeliness. 
As discussed above in conjunction with our analysis of 
Namahoe's request for relief pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b)(4), 
Namahoe was personally served with, inter alia, the Summons and Complaint and thereafter failed to appear before the Circuit 
Court.  We have rejected Namahoe's argument that notice of this foreclosure action was so infirm that it was inconsistent with due process and rendered the Foreclosure Judgment void.  Hungate is distinguishable.  Hungate involved an action for wrongful foreclosure based on the failure to comply with statutory and contractual (power of sale) requirements applicable to a notice of sale (and subsequent notices regarding the postponement of the sale) in the non-judicial foreclosure at issue in that case, rather than an HRCP Rule 60(b) motion seeking to void a judgment in a judicial foreclosure proceeding.  See Hungate, 139 Hawai# i 
at 5-6, 9-10, 391 P.3d at 398-99, 402-03.  Hungate simply does 
not address, directly or indirectly, the relief requested herein pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b)(4). 
Namahoe's second argument regarding the potential 
liability of a mortgagee's attorney is equally misplaced in this case.  There is no issue raised herein concerning potential claims against Nutter's attorneys, Clay Chapman. 
26 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Finally, we reject Namahoe's argument that Hungate 
"effectively contravenes" the Circuit Court's decision to deny 
relief pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b)(3) on the basis of timeliness. Here, we have concluded that the Circuit Court properly determined that HRCP Rule 60(b)(3) relief was unavailable because the Rule 60(b) Motion was filed well after the one-year limit; and the Circuit Court did not preclude Namahoe from seeking relief in the Wrongful Foreclosure Action, which is more akin to the suit before the supreme court in Hungate.  Hungate did not involve a request for relief pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b)(3). 
We conclude that the Circuit Court did not abuse its 
discretion in entering the Order Denying Motion for Reconsideration. V. CONCLUSION 
For these reasons, we affirm:  (1) the Circuit Court's 
April 5, 2017 Order Denying Rule 60(b) Motion; and (2) the Circuit Court's June 9, 2017 Order Denying Motion for Reconsideration.  All motions pending before the court in this 
27 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appeal, including the Motion to Substitute, are dismissed as 
moot.
