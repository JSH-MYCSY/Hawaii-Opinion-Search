APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 15-1-2203-11)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant William Halemano Frederick
 
(Frederick) appeals pro se from two June 5, 2017 post-judgment
 
orders (1) denying Frederick's post-judgment motion to dismiss
 
Plaintiff-Appellee United Guaranty Residential Insurance Company
 of North Carolina's (United Guaranty) complaint for foreclosure
 
(Order Denying Dismissal) and (2) denying Frederick's
 post-judgment motion to stay the judgment on the decree of
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
foreclosure (Order Denying Stay), which were entered by the
 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court).1
 
Frederick raises four points of error on appeal. This
 
court construes Frederick's first point of error as primarily
 
challenging United Guaranty's standing to bring this foreclosure
 action, the second point of error as contending that the Circuit
 Court abused its discretion in entering the Order Denying
 Dismissal, the third point of error as contending that the
 Circuit Court abused its discretion in entering the Order Denying
 Stay, and the fourth point of error as challenging the Circuit
 Court's November 1, 2016 Findings of Fact; Conclusions of Law;
 Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment as Against
 All Defendants and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure
 (Foreclosure Decree) [DKT 4 at 156] and November 1, 2016
 
Judgment, which entered final judgment on the Foreclosure Decree.
 
[DKT 4 at 166]
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, as well as the
 relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Frederick's points of
 error as follows: 
(1) Frederick argues, in essence, that the Foreclosure 
Decree and Judgment are void and unenforceable under Hawai' i 
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 60(b)(4) because United 
1
 The Honorable Jeannette H. Castagnetti presided.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Guaranty lacked standing to foreclose on the subject mortgage and
 
because he was not properly served with the complaint.2
 
"[A] judgment is void only if the court that rendered 
it lacked jurisdiction of either the subject matter or the parties or otherwise acted in a manner inconsistent with due process of law." Cvitanovich-Dubie v. Dubie, 125 Hawai' i 128, 
139, 254 P.3d 439, 450 (2011) (citation omitted). This court has further explained: 
Determining whether a judgment is void is not a matter
of discretion under HRCP Rule 60(b)(4). "In the sound
 
interest of finality, the concept of void judgment must be
narrowly restricted." Accordingly, "if a court has the
general power to adjudicate the issues in the class of suits
to which the case belongs then its interim orders and final
judgments, whether right or wrong, are not subject to
collateral attack, so far as jurisdiction over the subject
matter is concerned."
 
Dillingham Inv. Corp. v. Kunio Yokoyama Tr., 8 Haw. App. 226,
 
233–34, 797 P.2d 1316, 1319–20 (1990) (citations omitted). 
Frederick makes no specific argument in support of what
 
appears to be an assertion that service was not properly made as
 set forth in the Return and Acknowledgment of Service filed on
 November 24, 2015. Upon review of the record, we conclude that
 the Circuit Court did not err in denying relief on this ground.
 
There is no other challenge based on personal 
jurisdiction or on due process grounds. The argument that a party lacks standing is not equivalent to challenging a court's subject matter jurisdiction for the purposes of HRCP Rule 60(b)(4). Cf. Mort. Elec. Registration Sys., Inc. v. Wise, 130 
Hawai
'i 11, 17-18, 304 P.3d 1192, 1198-99 (2013) (holding that in 
2
 In addition to filing a post-judgment motion to dismiss based on
lack of service, Frederick filed a post-judgment motion to quash service. No
 
appeal was taken from the order denying that motion.

an appeal from an order confirming the foreclosure sale,
 
mortgagors were precluded from challenging the nominee's standing
 to bring foreclosure action).
3 Thus, we conclude that the
 
Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Frederick
 relief pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b)(4).
 
(2) In his post-judgment motion to dismiss the
 
complaint, which was filed on March 1, 2017, Frederick made, in
 essence, the same arguments as addressed above. Thus, we
 conclude that the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in
 entering the Order Denying Dismissal.
 
(3) Although Frederick asserts that the Circuit Court
 
erred in entering the Order Denying Stay, his arguments are
 directed more at the contention that the Circuit Court erred in
 entering the Foreclosure Decree and Judgment. Frederick did not
 timely file a notice of appeal, or a tolling motion, from the
 Judgment. Therefore, these arguments are not properly before the
 court in this appeal. See Hawaii Revised Statutes § 667-51
 
(2016). 
(4) In his final point of error, Frederick again
 
challenges the Foreclosure Decree and Judgment, which are not
 before us in this appeal. Therefore, we conclude that
 Frederick's further arguments are without merit.

 This court reached the same conclusion in Nationstar Mortg. LLC v.
Akepa Properties LLC, CAAP-15-0000407, 2017 WL 1401468 at *2-3 (Haw. App.
April 19, 2017) (SDO), stating, "lack of standing does not render a court's
ruling void under HRCP Rule 60(b)(4)" and "an argument that a party lacks
standing is not equivalent to challenging a court's subject matter
jurisdiction".
