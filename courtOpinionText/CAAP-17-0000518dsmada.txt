NO. CAAP-17-0000518
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
PETER MAC DONALD and CYNTHIA MAC DONALD,
Plaintiffs/Counterclaim-Defendants/Appellants,
v.
 
HAWAIIAN ACRES COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION,
a not-for-profit Corporation,
Defendant/Cross-Claim Plaintiff/Cross-Claim Defendant/Appellee,
and 
HAWAIIAN ACRES ROAD CORPORATION,
Defendant/Cross-Claim Defendant/Counterclaim-Plaintiff/
Cross-Claim Plaintiff/Appellee.
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 14-1-0032)
 
ORDER GRANTING THE SEPTEMBER 7, 2017 MOTION TO
DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Fujise and Chan, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) Defendant/Cross-Claim Plaintiff/
 
Cross-Claim Defendant/Appellee Hawaiian Acres Community
 
Association's (Appellee Hawaiian Acres Community Association)
 September 7, 2017 motion to dismiss appellate court case number
 CAAP-17-0000518 for lack of appellate jurisdiction, (2) the
 absence of any memorandum by Plaintiffs/Counterclaim-Defendants/
 Appellants Peter MacDonald and Cynthia MacDonald (the MacDonald
 Appellants) in response to Appellee Hawaiian Acres Community
 Association's September 7, 2017 motion, and (3) the record, it
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction over the MacDonald 
Appellants' appeal from the Honorable Greg K. Nakamura's June 1, 2017 judgment, because the June 1, 2017 judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable final judgment under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (2016), Rules 54(b) and Rule 58 of the Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP), and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 
869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
Under HRS § 641-1(a), an "appeal may be taken from 
circuit court orders resolving claims against parties only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 119, 869 
P.2d at 1338. 
In the instant case, the June 1, 2017 judgment does not
 
resolve all claims against all parties. The June 1, 2017
 judgment enters judgment in favor of Appellee Hawaiian Acres
 Community Association as to all claims that the MacDonald
 Appellants asserted, but the June 1, 2017 judgment
 
•	 does not resolve the MacDonald Appellants' two-
count complaint as to Defendant/Cross-Claim
Defendant/ Counterclaim-Plaintiff/Cross-Claim
Plaintiff/Appellee Hawaiian Acres Road Corporation
(Appellee Hawaiian Acres Road Corporation),
 
•	 does not resolve Appellee Hawaiian Acres Community
Association's cross-claim against Appellee
Hawaiian Acres Road Corporation,
 
•	 does not resolve Appellee Hawaiian Acres Road
Corporation's counterclaim against the MacDonald
Appellants, and
 
•	 does not resolve Appellee Hawaiian Acres Road
Corporation's cross-claim against Appellee
Hawaiian Acres Community Association.
 
In addition, the June 1, 2017 judgment does not contain an
 
express finding of "no just reason for delay" in the entry of
 judgment as to one or more but fewer than all claims or parties
 pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b). Therefore, the June 1, 2017
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable
 
final judgment under HRS § 641-1(a), HRCP Rule 54(b), HRCP
 Rule 58, and the holding in Jenkins. Absent an appealable final
 judgment, we lack appellate jurisdiction over appellate court
 case number CAAP-17-0000518, and the MacDonald Appellants' appeal
 is premature. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED AND DECREED that Appellee Hawaiian
 
Acres Community Association's September 7, 2017 motion to dismiss
 the MacDonald Appellants' appeal is granted, and appellate court
 case number CAAP-17-0000518 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
