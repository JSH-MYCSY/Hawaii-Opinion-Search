Judgment), also entered on June 19, 2017, by the circuit court. 
The Judgment and Order Granting Summary Judgment were entered
 
against Schranz and in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee U.S. Bank
 Trust, N.A., as Trustee for LSF9 Master Participation Trust (US
 
Bank). 
On appeal, Schranz contends that the circuit court
 
erred in concluding that US Bank had standing to foreclose
 
despite (1) US Bank's declaring witness not being qualified to
 authenticate US Bank's business records, and (2) US Bank not
 presenting "any business records demonstrating that its
 predecessor, Bank of America, was in possession of the underlying
 promissory note at the time this mortgage foreclosure action was
 filed[.]" 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant legal authorities, we resolve Schranz's
 point of error as follows, and we vacate and remand.
 
The Hawai' i Supreme Court's opinion in Bank of America, 
N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai' i 361, 390 P.3d 1248 (2017) is 
dispositive for the purposes of this appeal. In Reyes-Toledo, the supreme court held in a judicial foreclosure action that in order to establish a right to foreclose, the foreclosing plaintiff must establish standing, or entitlement to enforce the subject note, at the time the action was commenced. Id. at 
367-70, 390 P.3d at 1254-57. 
In Reyes-Toledo, the Hawai' i Supreme Court notes that a 
foreclosing plaintiff must typically "prove the existence of an agreement, the terms of the agreement, a default by the mortgagor under the terms of the agreement, and giving of the cancellation notice." Id. at 367, 390 P.3d at 1254 (citing Bank of Honolulu, 
N.A. v. Anderson, 3 Haw. App. 545, 551, 654 P.2d 1370, 1375
 (1982)). Furthermore, "[a] foreclosing plaintiff must also prove
 its entitlement to enforce the note and mortgage." Id. The
 
supreme court then expressed that "[a] foreclosing plaintiff's
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
burden to prove entitlement to enforce the note overlaps with the 
requirements of standing in foreclosure actions as 'standing is concerned with whether the parties have the right to bring suit.'" Id. (brackets omitted) (quoting Mottl v. Miyahira, 95 
Hawai'i 381, 388, 23 P.3d 716, 723 (2001)). Because "standing 
relates to the invocation of the court's jurisdiction, it is not surprising that standing must be present at the commencement of the case." Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai' i at 368, 390 P.3d at 1255. 
Thus, a foreclosing plaintiff must establish entitlement to enforce the note and standing to foreclose on the mortgaged property at the commencement of the suit. Id. 
Here, like the foreclosing bank in Reyes-Toledo, US
 
Bank was granted a decree of foreclosure via a summary judgment
 ruling. The Complaint for Mortgage Foreclosure (Complaint) in
 
this case was filed by Bank of America, N.A., Successor by Merger
 
to BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP FKA Countrywide Home Loans
 Servicing, LP (Bank of America). Thus, US Bank was required to
 
establish that Bank of America had standing when it initiated the
 
action.
 
The Complaint, filed on March 5, 2014, alleges, inter
 
alia, that: a promissory note was executed and delivered to
 Countrywide Bank, FSB (Countrywide) by Schranz; a true and
 
correct copy of the note was attached to the Complaint; and
 
"[Bank of America] qualifies as the Note holder with standing to
 prosecute the instant action as the Note is endorsed in blank,
 thereby converting the Note to a bearer instrument, and because
 [Bank of America] is currently in rightful possession of the
 endorsed Note." The copy of the Interest Only Adjustable Rate
 Note (Note) attached to the Complaint indicates Countrywide is
 
the lender on the Note and the Note is endorsed in blank by a
 
Senior Vice President of Countrywide.
 
On November 23, 2015, the circuit court issued an order
 
substituting US Bank as the plaintiff in place of Bank of
 America.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On August 31, 2016, US Bank filed a motion for summary
 
judgment. In support of its summary judgment motion, US Bank
 
attached, inter alia, a "Declaration of Indebtedness" by Alyssa
 Salyers (Salyers), executed on June 30, 2016, in which Salyers
 
identifies US Bank as "Plaintiff" and attests she is an
 
authorized signer of Caliber Home Loans, Inc. (Caliber),
 
"Plaintiff's servicing agent for the subject loan[.]" Salyers
 
further attests that "[US Bank] has possession of the Note"
 (emphasis added) and that "[i]n anticipation that the original
 Note is required for these foreclosure proceedings, the Prior
 Servicer had since caused the original Note to be delivered to
 the Plaintiff's attorney, TMLF Hawaii LLLC." Salyers also
 attested that a true and correct copy of the Note was attached to
 her declaration.
 
Salyers's Declaration does not attest that Bank of
 
America had possession of the Note when it filed the Complaint,
 and thus fails to establish Bank of America's standing to
 initiate this foreclosure action under Reyes-Toledo.
2
 
US Bank also filed a supplemental memorandum in support
 
of its Motion for Summary Judgment, which included a "Declaration
 of Counsel" by Peter T. Stone (Stone), executed on April 20,
 
2017. Stone attested that:
 
5. [Stone] is the managing attorney at TMLF Hawaii,
LLLC [(TMLF)], a Hawaii limited law company ("Counsel") in
this foreclosure action.
 
6. As the managing attorney, [Stone] has knowledge
of Counsel's foreclosure practice and procedures including
all court related filings in the case of foreclosure.
7. As the managing attorney, [Stone's] duties
include but are not limited to determining what
documentation Counsel will require its clients provide
before any foreclosure action is filed.
 
. . . .
 
2
 Given that Salyers's Declaration does not state that Bank of America
had possession of the Note at the time the Complaint was filed, we need not
address whether the declaration is sufficient for admitting the pertinentrecords under U.S. Bank N.A. v. Mattos, 140 Hawai 'i 26, 398 P.3d 615 (2017),
and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Behrendt, 142 Hawai 'i 37, 414 P.3d 89 (2018).

10. On 06/04/2012, Counsel received the original
Note dated 09/14/2007 signed by [Schranz], payable to
Countrywide Bank, FSB[.]
11. On 03/05/2014, the Complaint [was] filed.
12. We have had continuous possession of the
original Note since 06/04/2012 to the present.
 
(Emphasis added). In response, Schranz submitted the declaration
 
of his counsel, Frederick J. Arensmeyer (Arensmeyer), attesting
 
that Stone had worked for the Dubin Law Offices until July 5,
 
2013, and thus could not have independent personal knowledge that
 the Note was delivered to TMLF on June 4, 2012. At a minimum,
 the declarations by Stone and Arensmeyer create a genuine issue
 of material fact as to whether TMLF received the original Note
 prior to the filing of the Complaint in this action.
 
Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to
 
Schranz, as we must for purposes of a summary judgment ruling,
 there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Bank of
 America was entitled to enforce the subject Note and thus had
 standing at the time this foreclosure action was commenced.

Pursuant to Reyes-Toledo, the circuit court erred in granting US
 Banks's motion for summary judgment.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the following
 
entered by the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit are vacated:
 
(1) the "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order
 
Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment for Foreclosure
 Against All Defendants and for Interlocutory Decree of
 Foreclosure" entered on June 19, 2017; and
 
(2) the Judgment entered on June 19, 2017.
 
3 Bank of America submitted an "HRS § 667-O and P Affirmation" with its
Complaint, filed on March 5, 2014. However, an attorney affirmation does not
establish a lender's entitlement to enforce a note. See U.S. Bank Tr., N.A.
v. Busto, No. CAAP-16-0000334, 2017 WL 2579070, at *2 (Hawai 'i App. Jun. 14,
2017) (SDO) (with Ginoza, J., dissenting on grounds that a majority of thiscourt disregarded a similar attorney affirmation filed pursuant to HRS § 667­17); Wilmington Sav. Fund Soc'y v. Yasuda, No. CAAP-17-0000433, 2018 WL1904909, at *6 (Hawai 'i App. Apr. 23, 2018) (SDO) (with Ginoza, J., concurring
based on Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Behrendt, 142 Hawai 'i 37, 414 P.3d 89
(2018), wherein the Hawai 'i Supreme Court did not give any evidentiary merit
to the attorney affirmation in that case).
