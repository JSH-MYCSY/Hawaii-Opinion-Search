IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
TERI W. PEDRO, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 3CPC-17-0000310)
 
ORDER GRANTING AUGUST 19, 2017 MOTION TO DISMISS
APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
AND DISMISSING ALL PENDING MOTIONS AS MOOT
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Fujise and Chan, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) Defendant-Appellant Teri W. Pedro's 
(Appellant Pedro) August 19, 2017 motion to dismiss her own 
appeal in appellate court case number CAAP-17-0000520 for lack of appellate jurisdiction, (2) the lack of any response by Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai
'i (Appellee State) to Appellant 
Pedro's April 13, 2017 motion to dismiss, (3) Appellant Pedro's attorney, Deputy Public Defender James A. Tabe's declaration as to his unsuccessful efforts to contact Appellant Pedro by telephone or letter and why he was unable to obtain an affidavit or declaration that reflects a knowing and intelligent understanding of the consequences of the dismissal of the appeal and that the withdrawal is made voluntarily, pursuant to Rule 42(c) of the Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP), NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and (4) the record, it appears that we lack appellate
 
jurisdiction over Appellant Pedro's appeal from the Honorable
 Melvin H. Fujino's June 1, 2017 interlocutory order pertaining to
 bail.
 
"The right to an appeal is strictly statutory." State
 
v. Ontiveros, 82 Hawai
'i 446, 449, 923 P.2d 388, 391 (1996) 
(citation omitted). The Hawai 'i Intermediate Court of Appeals 
has jurisdiction "[t]o hear and determine appeals from any court or agency when appeals are allowed by law[.]" Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 602-57(1) (2016). In a circuit court criminal case, a defendant may appeal from a judgment of conviction that imposes a sentence pursuant to HRS ยง 641-11 (2016), from an interlocutory order that the circuit court certifies for appeal pursuant to HRS ยง 641-17 (2016), or from an interlocutory order denying a motion to dismiss based on double jeopardy pursuant to the collateral order doctrine. State v. Kealaiki, 95 Hawai
'i 
309, 312, 22 P.3d 588, 591 (2001). The June 1, 2017 order pertaining to bail does not satisfy the requirements for any of the three main categories of appealable orders and judgments, and the circuit court has not yet entered a final judgment in Criminal No. 3CPC-17-0000310. 
"An appellate court has . . . an independent obligation 
to ensure jurisdiction over each case and to dismiss the appeal sua sponte if a jurisdictional defect exists." State v. 
Graybeard, 93 Hawai
'i 513, 516, 6 P.3d 385, 388 (App. 2000) 
(citation omitted). Review of bail orders prior to a judgment of conviction may be obtained by application for an extraordinary writ to the Supreme Court, but not by appeal to this court. See HRAP Rule 9(a)(2). "A jurisdictional defect in an appeal cannot be waived by the parties or disregarded by us. We must dismiss an appeal on our own motion if we lack jurisdiction." State v. 
Johnston, 63 Haw. 9, 10, 619 P.2d 1076, 1077 (1980) (citations omitted). We lack jurisdiction over Appellant Pedro's appeal from the June 1, 2017 order pertaining to bail.
