ORDER GRANTING AUGUST 25, 2017 MOTION TO
DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Fujise and Chan, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) Intervenor-Appellee U.S. Bank
 
National Association, as Trustee for Structured Asset Securities
 
Corporation Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2007­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
GEL2's (U.S. Bank as Trustee) August 25, 2017 motion to dismiss 
appellate court case number CAAP-17-0000523 for lack of appellate jurisdiction, (2) the absence of a timely response by Respondent-Appellant Estelita Tabisula Terrado (Terrado), pro se, to U.S. Bank as Trustee's motion, and (3) the record, it appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction over Terrado's appeal from the following two judgments that the Honorable Rhonda A. Nishimura entered in S.P. No. 08-1-0202 (RAN): (1) the November 29, 2016 amended judgment on an amended order confirming the sale of foreclosed real property pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Hawai
'i 
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP), and (2) the November 9, 2015 judgment on a decree of foreclosure. Both of these judgments were immediately appealable pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes § 667-51(a) (2016). 
Rule 4(a)(1) of the Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) requires that "[w]hen a civil appeal is permitted by law, the notice of appeal shall be filed within 30 days after entry of the judgment or appealable order." Terrado did not file her August 25, 2017 notice of appeal within thirty days after entry of the November 29, 2016 amended judgment or the November 9, 2015 foreclosure judgment, as HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) required for a timely appeal. Therefore, Terrado's appeal is untimely. The failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise of judicial discretion. Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 
P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or justice is authorized to change the jurisdictional requirements contained in Rule 4 of these rules."); HRAP Rule 26(e) ("The reviewing court for good cause shown may relieve a party from a default occasioned by any failure to comply with these rules, except the failure to give timely notice of appeal."). Accordingly,
