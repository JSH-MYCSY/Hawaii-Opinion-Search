IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI #I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
AARON E. KLEEFIELD, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
NORTH AND SOUTH KONA DIVISION
(3DTA-17-00663)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Chan, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Aaron E. Kleefield (Kleefield)
appeals from the Judgment and Notice of Entry of Judgment,
entered on June 1, 2017, in the District Court of the Third
Circuit, North and South Kona Divsion (District Court).1
On June 1, 2017, the District Court sua sponte
dismissed, without prejudice, the charge of Operating a Vehicle
Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 291E-61(a)(1) (Supp. 2017),
against Kleefield.
On appeal, citing State v. Estencion , 63 Haw. 264, 625
P.2d 1040 (1981), Kleefield contends the District Court erred by
failing to make findings when dismissing the charge without
prejudice.  Kleefield requests the case be remanded with
instructions to dismiss the case with prejudice.  The State
contends Estencion is inapplicable because it only applies to
dismissals pursuant to Rule 48 of the Hawai# i Rules of Penal

Procedure (HRPP) and the record demonstrates that HRPP Rule 48
was not violated.  Instead, citing State v. Mageo , 78 Hawai #i 33,
889 P.2d 1092 (App. 1995), the State argues the District Court
did not abuse its discretion by dismissing the charge, pursuant
to HRPP Rule 9(c)(4)(ii), for failure to serve a second Penal
Summons and written findings are not required because the charge
was not dismissed with prejudice.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve Kleefield's point of error as follows:
The District Court erred by failing to enter written
findings setting forth its reasons for dismissal of the OVUII
charge without prejudice.  "In criminal cases, the power of a
court to dismiss a case on its own motion for failure to
prosecute with due diligence in inherent."  Mageo, 78 Hawai #i at
37, 889 P.2d at 1096 (citation, brackets, and internal quotation
marks omitted).  A trial court has the inherent power to dismiss
a charge with or without prejudice for the failure to prosecute
with due diligence, but should issue written findings setting
forth its reasons.  Id. at 37-38, 889 P.2d at 1096-97.  When
issuing its findings, the District Court should consider the
appropriate factors depending upon the grounds for dismissal. 
Compare, State v. Hern, 133 Hawai #i 59, 60, 323 P.3d 1241, 1242
(App. 2013) (Estencion factors must be clearly articulated when
dismissing charge for violation of HRPP Rule 48) with Mageo, 78
Hawai#i at 37-38, 889 P.2d at 1096-97 (citing State v. Moriwake,
65 Haw. 47, 647 P.2d 705 (1982), dismissal for violation of HRPP
Rule 9 requires "balancing [of] the interest of the state against
fundamental fairness to a defendant with the added ingredient of
the orderly functioning of the court system").  Given that the
reason for requiring the trial court to make findings underlying
its decision to dismiss with or without prejudice is to
facilitate review of this decision, we will not speculate on the

propriety of the District Court's decision in advance of its
articulation of its findings.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment and
Notice of Entry of Judgment, entered on June 1, 2017, in the
District Court of the Third Circuit, North and South Kona
Division is vacated and the case is remanded for further
proceedings.
