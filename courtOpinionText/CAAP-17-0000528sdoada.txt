TRICIA MORRIS, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.

HOMAS SEIDL, Defendant-Appellee 
BRUCE H. ERFER and LYNN N. ERFER,
Creditors-Intervenors-Appellees 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
WAILUKU DIVISION 
(CIVIL NO. 16-1-1708) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
This appeal arises from an award of attorneys' fees and 
costs in favor of Defendant-Appellee Thomas Seidl (Seidl
) and 
against Plaintiff-Appellant Tricia Morris (Morris) in this action 
alleging unpaid rent and seeking summary possession. Morris 
appeals from a "Judgment" entered on June 1, 2017, pursuant to, inter alia, the "Findings of Facts, Conclusions of Laws, and Order Granting Defendants' [sic] Motion for Attorneys' Fees and 
Costs" (Fees and Costs Order) entered on May 8, 2017, by the District Court of the Second Circuit (District Court).
1 The 
Judgment awarded $18,024.88 in attorneys' fees and $726.13 in 
costs to Seidl from Morris. 
1 The Honorable Adrianne N. Heely presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Morris contends on appeal that: (1) the District Court 
erred in awarding attorneys' fees to Seidl under Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS) § 607-14.5 (2016) because the case was not decided 
on the merits and her claims in this case were not frivolous or made in bad faith; (2) the District Court erred in not limiting its award of attorneys' fees to twenty-five percent of the judgment under HRS § 607-14 (2016); and (3) the District Court erred in applying HRS § 521-35 (2018) in its Fees and Costs Order because the rental agreement did not contain a provision allowing for an award of attorneys' fees.
2 
Upon careful review of the record and briefs submitted 
by the parties and having given due consideration to the arguments and issues they raise, as well as the relevant legal authority, we resolve Morris's points of error as follows, and we affirm. 
I. The District Court did not err in awarding Seidl attorneys'
fees and costs under HRS § 607-14.5 
Morris contends that the District Court erred in 
awarding Seidl attorneys' fees and costs under HRS § 607-14.5 
because the case was dismissed, not decided on the merits, and her claims were not frivolous. 
The Fees and Costs Order was explicitly granted 
pursuant to, inter alia, HRS § 607-14.5.
3 HRS § 607-14.5 
provides, in relevant part: 
(a) In any civil action in this State where a party seeks
money damages or injunctive relief, or both, against anotherparty, and the case is subsequently decided, the court may,as it deems just, assess against either party, whether ornot the party was a prevailing party, and enter as part ofits order, for which execution may issue, a reasonable sumfor attorneys' fees and costs, in an amount to be determinedby the court upon a specific finding that all or a portion 
2 Morris does not provide argument as to some of her asserted points of
error, and therefore we only address those points that are argued. See 
Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure ( HRAP ) Rule 28(b)(7) ("Points not argued
may be deemed waived."). We further note that many of the factual statementsasserted in Morris's opening brief are not supported by record references, asrequired by HRAP Rule 28(b)(3). Morris's counsel, Anthony Ranken, iscautioned to provide appropriate record references in support of assertedfacts. 
3 The Fees and Costs Order was granted pursuant to HRS §§ 607-14.5 and
607-9, and Hawai #i District Court Rules of Civil Procedure Rules 41 and 54(d).

of the party's claim or defense was frivolous as provided in
subsection (b). 
(b) In determining the award of attorneys' fees and costs
and the amounts to be awarded, the court must find inwriting that all or a portion of the claims or defenses madeby the party are frivolous and are not reasonably supportedby the facts and the law in the civil action. . . . 
(Emphases added). 
We first note that HRS § 607-14.5 does not require a 
case to be decided on the merits, either by trial or by summary 
judgment, before a court may award attorneys' fees as Morris contends. The plain language of HRS § 607-14.5 only requires that a case be "subsequently decided," and authorizes the award of attorneys' fees "against either party, whether or not the party was a prevailing party[.]" Here, the District Court "decided" this case when it entered its "Order Granting Defendant 
Thomas Seidl's Motion to Dismiss Amended Complaint" (Dismissal Order) on March 3, 2017, which, inter alia, dismissed Morris's claims in her Amended Complaint with prejudice. The fact that 
the case did not proceed to trial or was not decided by way of summary judgment did not preclude the District Court from awarding attorneys' fees under HRS § 607-14.5.
4 
We further conclude that the District Court did not 
clearly err in finding that Morris's claims were frivolous and made in bad faith.

"Pursuant to HRS § 607-14.5(a) and (b), to award 
attorney's fees for a frivolous claim, the court must make a 
4 Morris relies on Kukui Nuts of Hawaii, Inc. v. R. Baird & Co., Inc.,
6 Haw. App. 431, 726 P.2d 268 (1986), in support of her contention that a case
must be decided on its merits before a court may award attorneys' fees underHRS § 607-14.5. However, Kukui Nuts of Hawaii, Inc. is distinguishablebecause that case involved an appeal from judgments awarding attorneys' feesthat were entered prior to resolution of the claims in that case. Id. at 437 
n.8, 726 P.2d at 272 n.8. 
5 A trial court's conclusion as to whether a claim was made in bad 
faith and thus frivolous under HRS § 607-14.5 presents mixed questions of factand law. Coll v. McCarthy, 72 Haw. 20, 28, 804 P.2d 881, 886 (1991). "Where 
the court's conclusions are dependent upon the facts and circumstances of eachindividual case, the clearly erroneous standard of review applies." Id.

quotation marks and ellipses omitted). 
"A frivolous claim is a 
'claim so manifestly and palpably without merit, so as to indicate bad faith on the pleader's part such that argument to the court was not required.'" Id. (internal brackets omitted) (quoting Coll, 72 Haw. at 29, 804 P.2d at 887). "A finding of frivolousness is a high bar; it is not enough that a claim be without merit, there must be a showing of bad faith." Id. (citing Canalez v. Bob's Appliance Serv. Ctr., Inc., 89 Hawai# i 
292, 300, 972 P.2d 295, 303 (1999)). 
In its Fees and Costs Order, the District Court made a 
number of findings of facts (
FOF) and conclusions of law (COL) 
pertaining to its award to Seidl, including the following: 
40. On the date of the filing of [Morris's] complaint and
amended complaint, Defendant Seidl was a month tomonth tenant, pursuant to H.R.S. §521-22, and wasrequired to receive a 45 day notice. 
41. [Morris], had no right or basis for seeking summarypossession, her claim that she was entitled toSeptember and October rent from Mr. Siedl [sic], aswell as her claim that she was entitled to possessionpursuant to a 45 day notice, which was never given toTenant, until after the filing of the Amendedcomplaint, was frivolous, made in bad faith, withoutmerit, and arguably to circumvent the July 26, 2016Garnishee Summons Order to the Tenants of 598 Kumulani Drive, which was served upon Mr. Seidl prior to[Morris] filing the instant suit. 
42. This court finds that the 25 percent cap is notapplicable, not only because the claims by Ms. Morriswere made in bad faith, and initially in the nature ofassumpsit, rent claims, and amended to monetary andnon-monetary/possession claims which were subsequentlyordered to be withdrawn by the Receiver, not onlyconfusing to Mr. Seidl, but prejudiced him intodefending a suit, and incurring actual legal fees andcosts. 
43. [Morris's] claims, including the amended complaint,are manifestly and palpably without merit, so as toindicate bad faith. 
(Emphases added) (citation, internal quotation mark, and 
footnotes omitted). 
4  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Morris contends the District Court erred in finding and 
concluding that her claims in this case were frivolous and made 
in bad faith as contemplated under HRS § 607-14.5. We conclude that the District Court made sufficient findings in writing, which are supported by the record in this case, to support the award for attorneys' fees and costs to Seidl under HRS § 607-14.5. 
Morris's complaint, filed on September 16, 2016, 
alleged that there was an expired written rental agreement for the subject property which was broken by Seidl due to his failure to pay rent as of September 5, 2016, that Seidl owed $2,050, and that Seidl was served with a written 5-day notice of non-payment on September 8, 2016.
6 The complaint also indicates that Seidl 
was a month-to-month tenant. 
On September 30, 2016, Bruce H. Erfer and Lynn N. Erfer 
(the Erfers) moved to intervene in this case. In their motion, the Erfers asserted an interest in the rental income of the subject property pursuant to a judgment entered on March 20, 
2014, in a separate unrelated action (Erfer Lawsuit) in the 
Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (Circuit Court).
7 Attached 
to the Erfers' motion to intervene is a "Garnishee Summons and 
Order" (Garnishee Summons Order) in the Erfer Lawsuit dated July 26, 2016, which the record reflects was served on Seidl on 
September 9, 2016. Thus, the record shows that Seidl was served with the Garnishee Summons Order in the Erfer Lawsuit seven days before Morris filed the Complaint in this case on September 16, 2016. The Garnishee Summons Order directs the garnishees, designated as tenants of the subject property, to disclose to the Circuit Court whether Morris was in receipt of, inter alia, their rental income, and further ordered the garnishees to hold and secure any money from the time of service of the Garnishee 
6 The complaint alleges that the written rental agreement was broken
because of unpaid rent in the amount of "$1875 + $75 GET" and a late fee in
the amount of $100. 
7 The Honorable Peter T. Cahill presided over the Circuit Court
proceedings.

Summons Order until further ordered by the court. At the October 
3, 2016 return hearing in this case, the Erfers asserted that Morris had a "modus operandi of getting people that we garnish out of the property and replace them with people that have not been served [with the Garnishee Summons Order] yet." 
In its Fees and Costs Order, the District Court 
concluded that Morris's claims were made "arguably to circumvent the July 26, 2016 Garnishee Summons Order to the Tenants of 598 Kumulani Drive, which was served upon Mr. Seidl prior to [Morris] filing the instant suit." (Footnote omitted). The record confirms that Seidl was served with the Garnishee Summons Order prior to Morris filing her complaint. Further, in her opening brief, Morris acknowledges that Seidl informed her that he was served with the Garnishee Summons Order before she filed her Complaint in this case. The record in this case, including that Morris initiated this action against Seidl on the basis of his failure to pay rent despite already knowing that Seidl was precluded from paying her rent under the Garnishee Summons Order, supports the District Court's finding that Morris's claims were without merit and made in bad faith. Cf. Coll, 72 Haw. at 30, 
804 P.2d at 888 (holding that Plaintiff's knowledge at the time of the filing of his complaint that his allegation in his complaint was false is a clear indication of bad faith). 
Morris filed an Amended Complaint on October 3, 2016, 
in which she alleged that as of October 3, 2016, Seidl owed her $4,000 for rent unpaid in September and October. The District Court found, and the record supports the finding, that the Amended Complaint likewise had no merit and was brought in bad faith. In this regard, notwithstanding that the Garnishee Summons Order had been served on Seidl in September, the Amended Complaint continued to assert that Seidl owed rent to Morris for both September and October. The Amended Complaint further states written notice was given to Seidl on September 8, 2016 and June 15, 2016, "to correct this situation as follows: . . . 45-day termination of month-to-month tenancy[.]" However, the District 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Court specifically found, and Morris does not challenge the 
finding, that a 45 day notice was not given to Seidl until after the filing of the Amended Complaint. 
Based on the foregoing, the District Court did not 
clearly err in its findings, including that Morris's claims were "manifestly and palpably without merit, so as to indicate bad faith." Thus, the District Court did not err in awarding Seidl attorneys' fees and costs under HRS § 607-14.5.
II. Morris's remaining points of error 
In light of our holding that the District Court did not 
err in awarding Seidl attorneys' fees and costs under HRS § 607-
14.5, we need not reach Morris's other points of error asserting that attorneys' fees were not appropriate under HRS §§ 607-14 and 521-35. 
III. Conclusion 
Based on the foregoing, the Judgment entered on June 1, 
2017, and the "Findings of Facts, Conclusions of Laws, and Order 
Granting Defendants' Motion for Attorneys' Fees and Costs," entered on May 8, 2017, by the District Court of the Second Circuit, are affirmed.
