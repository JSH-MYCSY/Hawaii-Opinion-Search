APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(S.P. NO. 17-1-0112) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Chan, JJ.) 
United Public Workers, AFSCME, Local 646, AFL-CIO (the 
Union) appeals from the Judgment filed June 23, 2017, by the 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court).1 The Union 
also challenges the Circuit Court's Order Granting in Part and 
Denying in Part Union's Motion to Confirm Arbitration Decision and Award, to Enter Judgment, and for Other Appropriate Relief (Order), entered on June 23, 2017. 
1 The Honorable Gary W.B. Chang presided.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On appeal, the Union argues, on various grounds, that 
the Circuit Court abused its discretion in denying the Union's 
request for an award of costs on the Union's motion to confirm a stipulated arbitration award. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve the Union's contentions as follows: 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 658A-25 (2016) provides: 
ยง 658A-25 Judgment on award; attorney's fees
and litigation expenses.  (a) Upon granting an order
confirming, vacating without directing a rehearing,
modifying, or correcting an award, the court shallenter a judgment in conformity therewith. The judgmentmay be recorded, docketed, and enforced as any otherjudgment in a civil action.
(b) 
A court may allow reasonable costs of the 
motion and subsequent judicial proceedings.
(c) On application of a prevailing party to a
contested judicial proceeding under section 658A-22,658A-23, or 658A-24, the court may add reasonableattorney's fees and other reasonable expenses oflitigation incurred in a judicial proceeding after theaward is made to a judgment confirming, vacatingwithout directing a rehearing, modifying, orcorrecting an award. 
(Emphasis added). 
As the Circuit Court concluded, HRS ยง 658A-25(b), 
rather than the rule cited by the Union, Hawai# i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) Rule 54(d) is applicable here.2 The award of 
costs pursuant to HRS ยง 658A-25(b) is discretionary, not 
mandatory. The Circuit Court was not estopped from exercising its discretion based on the State of 
Hawai# i Department of 
Transportation, Highways Division, Hilo Baseyard's (the State's) 
statement that it had no objection to the Court awarding 
2 HRCP Rule 54(d)(1) provides that it is applicable except where
there is an express provision in a statute or another rule governing costs.

reasonable costs to the Union, as determined by the Court. The 
Circuit Court denied an award of costs on the grounds that the confirmation of the stipulated arbitration award was unnecessary because the State had already fully complied with the stipulated arbitration decision and the Union's reasons for seeking the entry of a judgment were unrelated to the dispute at bar. The Circuit Court recognized that the Union had a right to reduce the award to a judgment for other purposes, but declined to order the State to bear the Union's nominal costs under these circumstances. We conclude that the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in denying an award of costs to the Union. 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's June 23, 2017 
Judgment is affirmed.
