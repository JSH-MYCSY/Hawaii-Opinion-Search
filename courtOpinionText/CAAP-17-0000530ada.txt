WA DIVISION 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-17-01657) 
FEBRUARY 28, 2019 
GINOZA, CHIEF JUDGE, FUJISE and CHAN, JJ. 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY GINOZA, C.J. 
Defendant-Appellant Suzanne Satomi Chin-Yin Otani 
(Otani) appeals from a June 13, 2017 "Notice of Entry of Judgment 
and/or Order and Plea/Judgment" (
Judgment), entered by the 
District Court of the First Circuit, # Ewa Division (District 
Court).1 The District Court convicted Otani of one count of 
Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), 
1 The Honorable Randal I. Shintani presided. FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1),
and sentenced her to, among other things, a forty-eight hour term 
of imprisonment, pursuant to HRS § 291E-61(b)(4). 2 
On appeal, Otani argues the District Court abused its 
discretion in sentencing her to imprisonment under HRS § 291E-61(b)(4), because the District Court did not also sentence her to imprisonment under HRS § 291E-61(b)(1)(C)(ii). 
For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the 
Judgment. 
I.  Factual Background 
Otani was convicted for OVUII while driving with a 
passenger under the age of fifteen in the vehicle. The offense occurred on April 7, 2017. It was Otani's first OVUII offense. 
HRS § 291E-61(b) (Supp. 2017) provides, in relevant 
part: 
(b) A person committing the offense of operating a
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant shall be 
sentenced without possibility of probation or suspension ofsentence as follows:

(A) A fourteen-hour minimum substance 
abuse rehabilitation program,including education and counseling,or other comparable program deemedappropriate by the court; 
(B) One-year revocation of license andprivilege to operate a vehicleduring the revocation period andinstallation during the revocationperiod of an ignition interlockdevice on any vehicle operated bythe person; 
2 HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) (Supp. 2017) provides: 
§291E-61 Operating a vehicle under the influence of
an intoxicant . (a) A person commits the offense of
operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant ifthe person operates or assumes actual physical control of avehicle:

2 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(C) Any one or more of the following: 
(i) Seventy-two hours of
community service work; 
(ii) Not less than forty-eight hours and not morethan five days ofimprisonment; or 
(iii) A fine of not less than$150 but not more than $1,000; 
(D) A surcharge of $25 to be depositedinto the neurotrauma special fund;and 
(E) A surcharge, if the court so orders,of up to $25 to be deposited intothe trauma system special fund; 
(2) For an offense that occurs within five years of a prior conviction for an offenseunder this section or section 291E-4(a): 
. . . 
(3) For an offense that occurs within five 
years of two prior convictions foroffenses under this section or section 291E-4(a): 
. . . 
(4) In addition to a sentence imposed under
paragraphs (1) through (3), any person eighteenyears of age or older who is convicted underthis section and who operated a vehicle with apassenger, in or on the vehicle, who was youngerthan fifteen years of age, shall be sentenced toan additional mandatory fine of $500 and anadditional mandatory term of imprisonment offorty-eight hours; provided that the total termof imprisonment for a person convicted underthis paragraph shall not exceed the maximum termof imprisonment provided in paragraph (1), (2),or (3), as applicable. Notwithstandingparagraphs (1) and (2), the revocation periodfor a person sentenced under this paragraphshall be not less than two years[.] 
(Emphases added). 
At sentencing, the District Court and counsel engaged 
in the following discussion: 
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: . . . . 
Your Honor, as I'm reading the statute 291E-61(4)
[sic], it references a . . . mandatory sentence of 48 hours.
But it says "and in addition to." 
So my position on that is 
3 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that unless the Court imposes a sentence of between one and
five days under 291E-61(a)(1),[ ] then the mandatory should
not come into play because . . . the Legislature uses theterm "and" or conjunctive. So in other words, there wouldhave to be in -- a position [sic] of sentence under (a) --or 291E-61(a) as a first-time offender for jail, and Ms.Otani has never gotten into any trouble in her past. I mean . . . she is a first-time . . . offender. . . . It was an aberration. So we would ask the Court to not impose themandatory jail because she's not the type of person thatwould have had an imposition of jail under -- as a firstoffender under . . . 291E-61(a)(1). . . . 3
THE COURT: Okay. 
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: . . . [W]e would ask that no jail
be imposed. 
. . . . [THE STATE]: So, Your Honor, . . . I do not interpret
the enhanced sentencing to be read that way. I believe that 
the Court has discretion to impose either the 72 hours ofcommunity service, the jail, or a fine, as notated by the"or" in 291E-61(b)(1) through (3). But with regard to(b)(4), it reads "in addition to a sentence imposed underparagraphs (1) through (3).["] 
So Your Honor has the 
discretion to impose a sentence under subsections (1)through (3). 
And in addition to whatever sentence the Court 
imposes, the defendant who's convicted of having a person .. . 15 years and under shall be sentenced to an additionalmandatory fine of $500 and an additional mandatory term ofimprisonment of 48 hours, just provided that the total termof imprisonment does not exceed a maximum term provided inparagraphs (1), (2), or (3). 
. . . [A]nd I don't think that the Court has discretion with
regard to subsection 4. 
THE COURT: Okay. [Defense counsel], I beg to
disagree with your interpretation. I mean, if I were tofollow your interpretation, given the circumstances, I wouldconsider -- under subsections paragraphs (1) through (3),give your client . . . one or more of the following: 
either 
the fine of $1,000, 72 hours' community service, 48 hours'jail up to five days. 
That is part of the regular statute; is that correct,
[Defense counsel]? 
3 It appears defense counsel's reference to HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) was
incorrect, as that provision does not address sentencing. Further, theapplicable provision, HRS § 291E-61(b)(1)(C)(ii), does not provide forimprisonment of between one and five days, but rather allows sentencing toinclude "[n]ot less than forty-eight hours and not more than five days ofimprisonment[.]" 
4   II. Standards of Review FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, Your Honor. 
THE COURT: So, you know, I could give her 48 hours
under that provision and then impose the additional [48]
hours for the enhanced sentencing for a child under the . .. age of 15. So that would still make it under the . . . five-day limit. But I'm not sure you want to argue that ifyou're saying I have to give her jail time in order to alsoimpose a 48-hour mandatory jail time. . . . [I]f I'm notmistaken, that's what you're arguing. I have to give herjail time, otherwise I cannot impose the mandatory 48 hours'jail. 
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, Your Honor, that's why I was
letting the Court know that this individual would . . . notbe someone that really is appropriate for jail, given herhistory, . . . her background, given that this is a hugeaberration. 
. . . . 
THE COURT: . . . [U]nfortunately, the Court having
found her guilty as charged, I have no discretion, as I read
the statute. 
It's the Legislature . . . that has deemed it
mandatory sentence. . . . 
(Footnote added). 
The District Court entered the Judgment and Otani's 
sentence included forty-eight hours of imprisonment, a   fine, 
assessment of various fees, and referral to substance abuse 
assessment. 
A. Sentencing 
Sentencing decisions are reviewed under the abuse of
discretion standard. A sentencing judge generally has broaddiscretion in imposing a sentence. Generally, to constitutean abuse of discretion, it must appear that the courtclearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rulesor principles of law or practice to the substantialdetriment of a party litigant.

(citing State v. Hussein, 122 Hawai
#i 495, 503, 229 P.3d 313, 321 
(2010)). 
B. Statutory Interpretation

  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
This court's construction of statutes is guided by
established rules: 
First, the fundamental starting point forstatutory interpretation is the language of thestatute itself. Second, where the statutorylanguage is plain and unambiguous, our sole dutyis to give effect to its plain and obviousmeaning. Third, implicit in the task ofstatutory construction is our foremostobligation to ascertain and give effect to theintention of the legislature, which is to beobtained primarily from the language containedin the statute itself. Fourth, when there isdoubt, doubleness of meaning, orindistinctiveness or uncertainty of anexpression used in a statute, an ambiguityexists. 
When there is ambiguity in a statute, the meaning of theambiguous words may be sought by examining the context, withwhich the ambiguous words, phrases, and sentences may becompared, in order to ascertain their true meaning.Moreover, the courts may resort to extrinsic aids indetermining legislative intent, such as legislative history,or the reason and spirit of the law. 
State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai# i 383, 390, 219 P.3d 1170, 1177 
(2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
The Hawai# i Supreme Court has further noted that: 
the plain language rule of statutoryconstruction does not preclude an examination ofsources other than the language of the statuteitself even when the language appears clear uponperfunctory review. Were this not the case, acourt may be unable to adequately discern theunderlying policy which the legislature seeks topromulgate and, thus, would be unable todetermine if a literal construction would produce an absurd or unjust result, inconsistentwith the policies of the statute. 
We must read statutory language in the context of the entirestatute and construe it in a manner consistent with its purpose.

III. Discussion 
HRS § 291E-61(b)(4) provides, in relevant part: 
In addition to a sentence imposed under paragraphs (1)through (3), any person eighteen years of age or older whois convicted under this section and who operated a vehiclewith a passenger, in or on the vehicle, who was younger thanfifteen years of age, shall be sentenced to an additionalmandatory fine of $500 and an additional mandatory term ofimprisonment of forty-eight hours[.] 
(Emphases added). 
6  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Otani argues that in light of the phrase "[i]n addition 
to" in HRS § 291E-61(b)(4), the District Court was prohibited 
from sentencing her to forty-eight hours of imprisonment because the court did not sentence her to any imprisonment under HRS § 291E-61(b)(1)(C)(ii).
4 
According to the plain language of HRS § 291E-61(b)(4), 
when a person eighteen years of age or older commits OVUII with a passenger under fifteen years of age in or on the vehicle, in addition to "a" sentence under subsection HRS § 291E-61(b)(1), (2), or (3), the trial court must sentence the defendant to a forty-eight hour term of imprisonment. Contrary to Otani's argument, we do not interpret the "[i]n addition to" wording as indicating a legislative intent to limit the imposition of the prison sentence under subsection (b)(4) to situations in which the trial court has also sentenced the defendant to imprisonment under subsections (1), (2), or (3). Cf. State v. Ruggiero, 114 
Hawai# i 227, 238, 160 P.3d 703, 714 (2007) (noting a new 
aggravating factor under HRS § 291E-61(b)(4) (Supp. 2003), which imposed "additional punishments beyond those provided for in HRS § 291E–61(b)(1) to (3), for any adult convicted of operating a vehicle while under the influence and with a passenger under the age of fifteen years in or on the vehicle[.]"). 
The only part of HRS § 291E-61(b)(4) that arguably is 
ambiguous are the words "an additional" just before "mandatory term of imprisonment of forty-eight hours." However, there is no other mandatory term of imprisonment of forty-eight hours anywhere within HRS § 291E-61(b). Moreover, when we consider the legislative history for HRS § 291E-61(b)(4), it is apparent that the Legislature intended the forty-eight hours of imprisonment in this subsection to be mandatory and in addition to any sentence imposed in subsections (1), (2), or (3). 
4 HRS § 291E-61(b)(1) applies because Otani is a first-time offender.
The provision in subsection (b)(1) providing for imprisonment is subsection
(b)(1)(C)(ii). 
7 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The subject provision was first adopted in 1999, when 
the Legislature enacted Act 78, which, inter alia, amended HRS 
§ 291-4 (the predecessor statute to HRS § 291E-61). 1999 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 78, §§ 2, 6 at 131-32. This new subsection stated: 
Any person eighteen years of age or older, who is convicted
under this section and who operated or assumed actualphysical control of a vehicle with a passenger, in or on thevehicle, who was younger than fifteen years of age, shall besentenced to an additional mandatory fine of $500, and anadditional mandatory term of imprisonment of forty-eighthours; provided, however, that the total term ofimprisonment for a person convicted under this section shallnot exceed thirty days. 
Id. at 132; HRS § 291-4(b)(4) (Supp. 1999). 
The conference committee report on House Bill 212, 
which became Act 78, indicates the bill proposed imposing a 
mandatory fine of $500 when the triggering conditions were met. Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 77, in 1999 House Journal, at 943, 1999 Senate Journal, at 872. However, the conference committee amended the bill so that it would also include "as an additional penalty, a mandatory term of imprisonment of forty-eight hours[.]" Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 77, in 1999 House Journal, at 943, 1999 Senate Journal, at 873. Notably, the report does not indicate that the forty-eight hours prison sentence was only applicable if a prison sentence was also imposed under HRS § 291-4(b)(1), (2), or (3). 
The Legislature explained the purpose of Act 78: 
The legislature finds that serious motor vehicle
collisions involving child passengers are on the increase.
Many of these collisions have involved a driver who consumedintoxicating liquor and then operated a motor vehicle. In several recent incidents, child passengers of vehiclesdriven by such drivers have been killed or severely injured.Therefore, the legislature finds that stronger penalties areneeded to deter persons who would endanger their childpassengers by "drinking and driving." 
Accordingly, it is the purpose of this Act to impose
an additional, stiffer fine (in addition to the existingpenalties for driving under the influence of intoxicatingliquor) on any person age eighteen years or over convictedof driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor whilehaving in the vehicle a passenger younger than fifteen yearsof age. 
8  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
1999 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 78, § 1 at 131 (emphasis added). The 
Legislature's intent was to require additional penalties for driving under the influence of an intoxicant that endangers a passenger under the age of fifteen. 
The provision for enhanced sentences in HRS § 291-
4(b)(4) was recodified as part of the Legislature's repeal of HRS § 291-4 and the enactment of HRS chapter 291E. See 2000 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 189, §§ 23 and 30 at 425-27, 432. Within chapter 291E, the enhanced sentencing provision was originally set forth in § 291E-61(b)(5), effective January 1, 2002. See 2000 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 189, §§ 23 and 41, at 425-27, 433; HRS § 291E-61(b)(5) (Supp. 2000). 
After further revisions by the Legislature, the 
provision was subsequently recodified to the current provision in HRS § 291E-61(b)(4). See 2001 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 157, § 25 at 397-98; 2003 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 71, § 3 at 124-26; 2005 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 33, § 1 at 68-69; 2006 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 201, § 7 at 868-69; 2007 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 198, § 4 at 391-92; 2008 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 171, § 8 at 618-20; 2009 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 88, § 6 at 216-18; 2010 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 166, § 19 at 408-09.
 5
The "[i]n addition to" language that now appears at the 
beginning of subsection (b)(4) was adopted effective as of January 1, 2011, as part of HRS § 291E-61(b)(4):
6 
In addition to a sentence imposed under paragraphs (1)
through (3), any person eighteen years of age or older whois convicted under this section and who operated a vehiclewith a passenger, in or on the vehicle, who was younger thanfifteen years of age, shall be sentenced to an additionalmandatory fine of $500 and an additional mandatory term ofimprisonment of forty-eight hours; provided that the totalterm of imprisonment for a person convicted under thisparagraph shall not exceed the maximum term of imprisonmentprovided in paragraph (1), (2), or (3), as applicable. . . . 
HRS § 291E-61(b)(4) (Supp. 2011) (emphasis added). 
5 There were amendments to the enhanced sentencing provision that are
not material to this opinion and thus are not discussed. 
6 The "[i]n addition to" language was originally adopted by the
Legislature in the 2008 Hawai #i Session Laws, to go into effect on July 1,
2010. 2008 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 171, §§ 8 and 20, at 618-20, 628. However,after further revisions by the Legislature in 2009, the "[i]n addition to"language was made effective as of January 1, 2011. 2009 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 88, §§ 6 and 17, at 216-18, 222. 
9   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Nothing in the legislative history of HRS § 291E-61 
explains why the "[i]n addition to" language was added. From our 
reading of the statutes and legislative history, it appears this language was adopted to reinforce the underlying purpose of subsection (b)(4) and the notion that the enhanced prison sentence was to be imposed in addition to a sentence under one of the prior subsections of HRS § 291E-61(b). 
Here, although the District Court decided not to 
sentence Otani to imprisonment under HRS § 291E-61(b)(1)(C)(ii), the District Court correctly imposed the imprisonment term set forth in HRS § 291E-61(b)(4), because the court did impose a sentence against Otani under subsection (b)(1) and the other requirements of subsection (b)(4) were met.
IV. Conclusion

Order and Plea/Judgment" entered by the District Court of the First Circuit,
