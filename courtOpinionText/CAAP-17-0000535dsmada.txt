APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 16-1-0045 (K))
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Ginoza, C.J., Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
appellate jurisdiction over Plaintiffs-Appellants Margaret Louise
Royce and Steven Michael Royce's (the Royces) appeal from the
Honorable Ronald Ibarra's June 8, 2017 order denying the Royces'
motion for reconsideration of an October 11, 2016 order granting
Defendants-Appellees Bank of America, N.A. (Bank of America), and
Countrywide Home Loans, Inc.'s (Countrywide), motion to dismiss
the Royces' amended complaint to quite title.  The record on
appeal does not indicate that the circuit court has resolved the
Royces' amended complaint as to the other three remaining NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
defendants in Civil No. 16-1-0045K, namely Defendants-Appellees
Plaza Home Mortgage, Inc. (Plaza Home Mortgage), Federal National
Mortgage Association (Federal National Mortgage Association), and
BOFA Merrill Lynch Asset Holdings, Inc. (BOFA Merrill Lynch Asset
Holding), and the circuit court has not yet reduced any of its
dispositive rulings to an appealable final judgment.
Although the circuit court's October 11, 2016 order
dismissed the Royces' amended complaint as to Bank of America and
Countrywide Home Loans, an aggrieved party cannot obtain
appellate review of a dismissal order pursuant to Hawaii Revised
Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-1(a)(2016) until the circuit court reduces
the dismissal order to a final judgment as to all claims and
parties pursuant to Rule 58 of the Hawai #i Rules of Civil
Procedure (HRCP).  See Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright ,
76 Hawai #i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994) ("An appeal may
be taken from circuit court orders resolving claims against
parties only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and
the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the
appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]").  "Thus,
based on Jenkins  and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable,
even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has
been reduced to a separate judgment."  Carlisle v. One (1) Boat,
119 Hawai# i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008).  The circuit
court has not yet reduced the October 11, 2016 order of dismissal
to a separate and appealable final judgment.
Granted, "[a]n order denying a motion for post-judgment
relief under HRCP [Rule] 60(b) is an appealable final order under
HRS ยง 641-1(a)."  Ditto v. McCurdy , 103 Hawai #i 153, 160, 80 P.3d
974, 981 (2003) (citation omitted).  Nevertheless, where, as
here, the circuit court has not yet entered an appealable final
judgment, the Supreme Court of Hawai #i "hold[s] that relief under
HRCP Rule 60(b) requires an underlying judgment that comports
with the principles of finality set forth in Jenkins.  Absent an 
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
underlying appealable final judgment, the circuit court's rulings
on a purported Rule 60(b) motion are interlocutory and not
appealable until entry of such a judgment."  Bailey v.
DuVauchelle, 135 Hawai# i 482, 491, 353 P.3d 1024, 1033 (2015). 
Consequently, the June 8, 2017 order denying the Royces' motion
for reconsideration of the October 11, 2016 order of dismissal is
interlocutory and not eligible for appellate review until the
circuit court enters an appealable final judgment.
The Supreme Court of Hawai #i recently held that, when
the record on appeal indicates that the circuit court has
resolved all claims against all parties, and the only thing
lacking to perfect an aggrieved party's right to obtain appellate
review is the entry of an appealable final judgment, the Hawai #i
Intermediate Court of Appeals should invoke HRS ยง 602-57(3)
(2016), and temporarily remand the case to the circuit court with
instructions to enter, and supplement the record on appeal with,
an appealable final judgment as to all claims and parties. 
Waikiki v. Ho# omaka Village Association of Apartment Owners, 140
Hawai#i 197, 204, 398 P.3d 786, 793 (2017).  However, we conclude
that the holding in Waikiki is inapplicable here because the
circuit court has not yet resolved the Royces' amended complaint
as to three other named defendants, namely Plaza Home Mortgage,
Federal National Mortgage Association, and BOFA Merrill Lynch
Asset Holdings.  For example, the record reveals that on
March 29, 2016, the circuit court denied Plaza Home Mortgage's
Motion to dismiss the Royces' amended complaint as to Plaza Home
Mortgage.  Where, as here, the record on appeal does not indicate
that the circuit court has resolved all claims as to all parties,
a temporary remand with instructions to enter an appealable final
judgment on all claims (including the unresolved claims) is
neither warranted nor authorized under HRS ยง 602-57(3) and the
holding in Waikiki.  In the absence of an appealable final
judgment as to all claims and parties, the Royces' appeal is
premature and we lack appellate jurisdiction.

case number CAAP-17-0000535 is dismissed for lack of appellate
