 the County of Kauaʻ i, the County of Kauaʻ i Planning  Department, 
and the Planning Commission of the County of Kauaʻi. 
Campos owns real property "described as Unit A of the 
Seacliff Plantation - Lot 25 Condominium Project Located in 
[Kīlauea], Kauaʻ i . . . containing an area of 5.0 acres" 
(
Property).2  Findings of Fact (FOF) 1.3  This project is 
comprised of Campos's Property and two other "apartments with 
improvements thereon."  FOF 1. 
Campos's "Property is located in a State Land Use 
District . . . Agricultural District, the Kaua‘ i County General 
Plan Agriculture Land Use Designation Area, Special Management Area . . . , the North Shore Development Plan Area, and the Open 
Space, Special Treatment Scenic/Ecological . . . Resources 
District."  FOF 2.  "Further, a portion is in the 
Comprehensive 
Zoning Ordinance [(or CZO)] Agriculture District and another portion is in the CZO Open District."  FOF 2 (emphasis added).   
According to Campos, the soil on the Property is rated B, C, 
and D.  
This secondary appeal arises from the Planning 
Commission's revocation of a Provisional Nonconforming Use

Plantation - Lot 25" recorded with the Hawaiʻ i Bureau of Conveyances, the 
entire project was 12.41 acres with 
"Apartments" 1 and 2 being five acres 
each and " Apartment" 3 being 2.41 acres.  (Some formatting altered.)

 Certificate, issued to Campos, allowing the structure on the 
Property (Guest House) to be used as a single-family transient 
vacation rental.  On appeal, Campos asserts that the revocation 
violated Kaua‘i Co unty' s Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance, his 
grandfather rights under the United States and Hawai‘ i 
Constitutions, his due process right, and its own rules.4  
We affirm because use of the Guest House, as originally 
built, violated the zoning permit obtained by the prior owner, and 
consequently there was no prior legal use to be grandfathered.  We 
also hold that Campos was afforded due process and waived the 
argument that the Planning Commission violated its own rules. 
I. BACKGROUND 
The background in this case spans over twenty years, 
starting with the Property's prior owner. A. Prior Owner 
In 1998, the prior owner of the Property, Simon Potts, 
applied to the Planning Department for a zoning permit.  On the 
application, Potts indicated that the lot size was 12.407 acres, 
the zoning was "Ag/Open STR," and the existing land use had

as required by Hawaiʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4).  We 
construe Campos's "Statement of Questions Presented f or Decision" as his 
points of error.  (Formatting altered.) 
 
Campos does not challenge the Planning Commission's FOF or conclusions 
of law (COL) pursuant to HRAP  Rule 28(b)(4).  See Wisdom v. Pflueger, 4 Haw. 
App. 455, 459, 667 P.2d 844, 848 (1983) ("If a finding is not properly 
attacked, it is binding; and any conclusion which follows from it and is a 
correct statement of law is valid. "). FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 "AG/Farm Dwelling."  (Formatting altered.)  Under "DESCRIPTION 
OF PROPOSED USE, IMPROVEMENT, ALTERATION, AND/OR CONSTRUCTION," 
Potts wrote "CONSTRUCTION OF GUEST COTTAGE." 
Architect Daniel Moran (Architect Moran) prepared 
Zoning Plans for the Guest House, which were submitted as part 
of Potts's zoning permit application.  FOF 3.  The Zoning Plans 
indicated that the Guest House would consist of 484 square feet 
of floor area, without a kitchen.  FOF 3. 
The Planning Department issued Potts a Class I zoning 
permit in July 1998, Zoning Permit No. Z-437-98, to construct the Guest House, and indicated the occupancy type as "OTHER."  
After a permit was issued for a Gazebo in September 1998, no 
other zoning permits were approved for the Property.  FOF 4. 
About two years later, in 2000, the Department of 
Public Works, Building Section, approved Building Plans, also 
submitted by Architect Moran, for the Guest House and issued a 
Building Permit.  FOF 5.  However, the Building Plans differed from the Zoning Plans because the Building Plans included a 
kitchen for the same Guest House.  FOF 5. 
In 2006, Campos purchased the Property from Potts, and 
began operating it as a transient vacation rental, "and 
continued operation of the Noni Orchard situated thereon under 
the same independent contractor as" Potts.  FOF 6.

 B. Zoning Ordinance Nos. 864 (2008) and 904 (2010) 
As explained infra in more detail, in 2008, the County 
adopted Ordinance No. 864, prohibiting transient vacation rentals 
that were not within the Visitor Destination Area,5 pursuant to 
Kauaʻi County Code (KCC) Title IV, Chapter 8, Article 17.  
Ordinance 
No. 864, however, "also established a procedure for any 
owner, operator, or proprietor of a single-family transient vacation rental operating outside of" the Visitor Destination Area, as of March 7, 2008, to obtain a nonconforming use certificate to continue operating as a transient vacation rental.
 KCC § 8-17.10(b) (2010); FOF 33. 
  Campos (providing a Texas address) sent the Planning 
Department a letter authorizing his attorney in Līhu‘e and his 
brother, David Campos (also providing a Texas address), "to act 
as [his] agents for the filing and processing of the Application 
for a Use Permit and Class III Zoning Permit, as well as any 
other land-use permits and approvals relative to said application." 
 
 About two years later, in 2010, Ordinance No. 904 
amended the grandfather provision established by Ordinance 
No. 864 and addressed single-family transient vacation rentals 
operating on lands designated agricultural. 
 
5  Ordinance No. 864 defined Visitor Destination Area as "those areas 
designated as Visitor Destination Areas on County of Kaua‘ i zoning maps."  
Campos does not assert that the Property was in a Visitor Destination Area.  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 C. Campos's Application for a Nonconforming Use Certificate 
On October 15, 2010, following the adoption of 
Ordinance No. 904, the Planning Department received Campos's 
application to register his Guest House identified as the 
"Hawaiian Romantic Cottage" as a transient vacation rental, and 
requesting a nonconforming use certificate.  FOF 8.  Campos's 
application identified the unit as a "studio, 1 bath SFR."  FOF 8.  
Campos represented the unit as a "single family vacation rental" in the State Land Use Agricultural District.  FOF 8. 
Campos also represented that "Building permit 
number(s) Z-437-98 was approved on 6-19-98 for all structures on 
the property and there were no expansions, alterations, 
improvements, or uses contrary to State and County land use and 
planning laws" and "[t]here were not any legal expansion or 
improvements made on the property after March 7th 2008."  FOF 9.  
The application included an "As Built Drawing" of the Guest 
House, again by Architect Moran, showing a kitchen.  FOF 10. 
In his application, 
Campos requested:  (1) a Special 
Permit pursuant to Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) § 205-6 and 
Hawai‘i Administrative Rules Title 15, Subtitle 3, Chapter 15, 
Subchapter 12 as "is required for the proposed use of the 
Subject Property, which is within the State Land Use 
Agricultural District, in conjunction with a transient vacation rental use of the dwelling on the Subject Property"; (2) a Use FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 Permit pursuant to "CZO Chapter 8, Article 20," "as it is not a 
generally permitted use (although single family dwellings are 
generally permitted under CZO Section 8-7.2(a)(15), the short-
term rental may trigger the need for a Use Permit)"; and (3) a 
Class IV Zoning Permit pursuant to "CZO Sections 8-7.7(4), 8-
8.7, and 8-19.6." 
The Planning Department "provisionally approved" 
Campos's application, and issued the Provisional Nonconforming Use Certificate.  FOF 11. 
Planning Department personnel inspected the Guest 
House, and determined it indeed contained a kitchen, "but there 
was no conversion permit to change 'the guest house to a legal 
single family residence as mandated by Ordinance No. 904 nor 
were the interior kitchen improvements authorized by permit.'"  
FOF 12. 
As a result, in a December 22, 2011 letter, the 
Planning Department revoked Campos's Provisional Nonconforming Use Certificate, and instructed Campos to stop using the Guest 
House as a transient vacation rental or face fines "up to 
$10,000 and/or up to $10,000 per day for each day the violation 
persists."  FOF 12. 
D. Campos's Appeal to the Planning Commission 
In January 2012, Campos appealed the Planning 
Department's decision revoking the Provisional Nonconforming Use FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 Certificate, and requested a public hearing.  FOF 14.  In March 
2014, a Planning Department Inspection/Research Report confirmed 
Campos was still operating his Guest House as a transient 
vacation rental.  FOF 16.  As of November 2015, the Guest House 
was being advertised online as containing "a kitchen with a 
refrigerator, stove top burner, oven, dishwasher, blender, ice 
maker, coffee maker and toaster."  FOF 17. 
Campos's contested case hearing was held in November 
2015.  The Hearing Officer issued his report, recommending the Planning Commission deny Campos's appeal and affirm the Planning 
Department's revocation of the Provisional N onconforming Use 
Certificate because "there was no conversion permit to convert [Campos's] Guest House with a kitchen to a legal single family 
dwelling unit as mandated by Ordinance No. 904, nor were the 
interior kitchen improvements authorized by permit."  The 
Hearing Officer also recommended fining Campos $25,000 for 
operating his Guest House as a single-family transient vacation 
rental outside the Visitor Destination Area. 
After holding oral arguments, the Planning Commission 
agreed with the Hearing Officer's recommendations, and issued its  
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Decision and Order 
affirming the Planning Department's decision.

 E. Campos's Appeal to the Circuit Court 
Campos appealed to the circuit court.  The circuit 
court heard arguments, and entered its Decision and Order 
affirming the Planning Commission's Decision and Order.  
Regarding the fines imposed, the circuit court stated 
that from December 2011, "Campos knew that he was instructed by 
the Planning Department to cease and desist use of the Guest 
House as a [transient vacation rental] and terminate any further 
advertising of the Subject Property for [transient vacation 
rental] use."  "However, as late as the morning of the Hearing 
[Campos] was still advertising the Guest House on the internet 
as the [transient vacation rental] 'Hawaiian Romantic Cottage.'" 
The circuit court further determined that "[f]or over 
four (4) years, Campos has failed to comply with the request of the Planning Department to cease and desist use of the Guest 
House as a [transient vacation rental] and terminate any further 
advertising of the Subject Property for [transient vacation 
rental] use."  "Although the Planning Department could have 
imposed a fine of up to $10,000 per day for each day the aforesaid violation existed, . . . instead it requested a fine 
'of at least $25,000 [payable] to the County of 
Kauaʻi for the  
continued illegal operation of a [transient vacation rental] 
without a [nonconforming use certificate].'" 
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
10 
 The circuit court then concluded that  
Campos has not met his burden to establish by a preponderance 
of the evidence that the Planning Director's decision to 
impose a fine of at least $25,000 for violation of the 
provisions of the CZO by operating a [transient vacation rental] outside of the [Visitor Destination Area] without a 
[nonconforming use certificate] was based upon an erroneous 
finding of a material fact, arbitrary or capricious, or an 
abuse of . . . discretion because he did not offer any 
evidence to contest that decision.  
 
On June 13, 2017, the circuit court entered its final 
judgment affirming the Planning Commission's Decision and Order, 
revoking Campos's Provisional Nonconforming Use Certificate and 
imposing a $25,000.00 fine. 
Campos timely appealed to this court. 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A. Secondary Appeals 
Review of a decision made by the circuit court upon 
its review of an agency's decision is a secondary appeal.   
The standard of review is one in which this court must 
determine whether the circuit court was right or wrong in its decision, applying the standards set forth in HRS § 91-
14(g) . . . to the agency's decision.
 
 
Flores v. Bd. of Land & Nat. Res., 143 Hawai‘i 114, 120, 424 P.3d 
469, 475 (2018) (citations omitted). 
Pursuant to HRS § 91-14(g) (2012 & Supp. 2016), 
Upon review of the record the court may affirm the decision 
of the agency or remand the case with instructions for 
further proceedings; or it may reverse or modify the decision and order if the substantial rights of the petitioners may have been prejudiced because the 
administrative findings, conclusions, decisions, or orders 
are: 
(1) In violation of constitutional or statutory 
provisions; 
(2) In excess of the statutory authority or 
jurisdiction of the agency; 
(3) Made upon unlawful procedure; FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 (4) Affected by other error of law; 
(5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, 
probative, and substantial evidence on the 
whole record; or 
(6) Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized by 
abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion. 
 
Additionally, an "agency's decision carries a presumption of 
validity and [an] appellant has the heavy burden of making a convincing showing that the decision is invalid because it is 
unjust and unreasonable in its consequences."  Kauaʻ i Springs,

III.   DISCUSSION  
Campos contends t
he Planning Commission's revocation of 
the Provisional Nonconforming Use Cert ificate violated the 
Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance, his grandfather rights under the 
United States and Hawaiʻi Constitutions, his due process right, 
and the Planning Commission's own rules.

 A. Relevant Legal Authority  
1. Hawaiʻi Constitution 
The Hawaiʻi Constitution provides that "[n]o person 
shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due 
process of law . . . ."  Haw. Const. art. I, § 5; see U.S. Const . 
amend. V (providing same).  
The Hawaiʻi Constitution also mandates that our state 
"conserve and protect agricultural lands, promote diversified agriculture, increase agricultural self-sufficiency and assure the availability of agriculturally suitable lands," and requires 
the legislature to "provide standards and criteria to accomplish 
the foregoing."  Haw. Const. art. XI, § 3. 
2. 
Statutory Law 
a. HRS § 46-4, County Zoning 
The counties within our state "derive their zoning 
powers from HRS § 46–4(a) . . . , referred to as the Zoning 
Enabling Act."  Kaiser Hawaii Kai Dev. Co. v. City & Cnty. of 
Honolulu, 70 Haw. 480, 483, 777 P.2d 244, 246 (1989).  "Zoning in 
all counties shall be accomplished within the framework of a long-range, comprehensive general plan prepared or being 
prepared to guide the overall future development of the county."  
HRS § 46-4(a) (Supp. 2016).

construed" in the counties' favor to promote orderly development FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 according to the comprehensive general plan to ensure the 
greatest benefit for the whole of Hawaiʻi by regulating zoning 
and building: 
The powers granted herein shall be liberally construed in 
favor of the county exercising them, and in such a manner as 
to promote the orderly development of each county or city 
and county in accordance with a long- range, comprehensive 
general plan to ensure the greatest benefit for the State as 
a whole.  This section shall not be construed to limit or 
repeal any powers of any county to achieve these ends 
through zoning and building regulations[.] 
 
HRS § 46-4(a).  And in accordance with the Hawaiʻi Constitution, 
the counties cannot prohibit "continued lawful use" of a 
building or premises at the time an ordinance takes effect: 
Neither this section nor any ordinance enacted pursuant to 
this section shall prohibit the continued lawful use of 
any building or premises for any trade, industrial, 
residential, agricultural, or other purpose for which the 
building or premises is used at the time this section or 
the ordinance takes effect[.] 
 
HRS § 46-4(a) (emphasis added). 
b. HRS Chapter 205, Land Use Commission 
"While the counties are empowered to enact zoning 
ordinances, HRS chapter 205 clearly limits the permissible uses 
allowed within an agricultural district."  Save Sunset Beach 
Coal. v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 102 Hawai‘i 465, 482, 78 P.3d 
1, 18 (2003).  "Within agricultural districts . . . accessory agricultural uses and services described in sections 205-2 and 205-4.5 may be further defined by each county by zoning ordinance."  HRS § 205-5(b) (2017). 
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
14 
 HRS § 205-2(d) (Supp. 2012) lists seventeen uses or 
activities agricultural districts "shall include," and transient 
vacation rentals is not expressly listed.    
HRS § 205-4.5(a) (Supp. 2006 & 2016) delineates the 
permissible uses in agricultural districts rated class A or B.  One permissible use in an agricultural district is a farm 
dwelling, which was defined as "a single-family dwelling located 
on and used in connection with a farm[.]"  HRS § 205-4.5(a)(4) (Supp. 2006 & 2016).  Of the fourteen permissible uses within the agricultural district enumerated in subsection (a), none expressly included transient vacation rentals.  HRS § 205-4.5(a) 
(Supp. 2006).
 
Any use not expressly allowed in subsection (a) is 
prohibited, unless an HRS § 205-6 (2001 & Supp. 2016) special 
permit or an HRS § 205-8 (2001) nonconforming use certificate is obtained.
 See HRS § 205-4.5(b) (Supp. 2016).  Thus, any use 
permitted by a county not expressly allowed in HRS § 205–4.5(a), or by virtue of HRS §§ 205–6 or 205–8, conflicts with the 
statutory regime.

 & Supp. 1988 through Supp. 2006) (approved June 30, 2006)).  
Ordinance No. 864 did not amend KCC § 8- 17.1.   
By Ordinance No. PM- 255-92 (August 13, 1992), 
Article 17 limited transient vacation rentals to certain areas: 
Subject to the limitations contained in Section 8- 17.5, 
transient vacation rentals are allowed:

any underlying zoning designation and with the exception of 
properties on the National or State Register of Historic Places, 
single-family transient vacation rentals are prohibited in all 
areas not designated as Visitor Dest ination Areas."  KCC § 8-
17.8(a) (2008  and 2010).  
KCC § 8-17.9 provided in part that "[n]o single -family 
transient vacation rental shall operate outside a Visitor Destination Area without a Nonconforming Use Certificate obtained 
under Section 8- 17.10."  KCC § 8- 17.9(b) (2008 and 2010) .   
KCC § 8-17.10 addressed "Nonconforming Use Certificates 
for Single- Family Vacation Rentals." 
KCC § 8-17.10(a) explained that the purpose of KCC § 8-
17.10 was to identify and register single-family transient 
vacation rentals which have been in lawful use and to allow them 
to continue by obtaining a nonconforming use certificate:  
The purpose of this section is to provide a process to 
identify  and register those single -family transient vacation 
rentals as nonconforming uses which have been in lawful use  
prior to the effective date of this ordinance and to allow 
them to continue subject to obtaining a nonconforming use 
certificate as provided by this section.   
 
KCC § 8-17. 10(a) (2010) (emphases added).  
KCC § 8-17.10(b) provided that " [t]he owner, operator 
or proprietor of any single- family transient vacation rental 
which operated outside of a Visitor Destination Area prior to

 March 7, 2008 shall obtain a nonconforming use certificate for 
single family  vacation rentals."  KCC § 8-17.10(b) (cleaned up).  
KCC § 8-17.10(c) prohibited issuing a nonconforming use 
certificate unless the use as a single- family rental was legal 
under the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance: 
No nonconforming use certificate shall be issued by 
the Planning Director unless the use as a single -family 
rental is a legal use under the Comprehensive Zoning 
Ordinance, and the applicant provides a sworn affidavit and 
demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Planning Director 
that a dwelling unit was being used as a vacation rental on 
an ongoing basis prior to March 7, 2008 .  The Planning 
Director , in making the decision, shall take into 
consideration, among other things, the following guidelines:  
 
(1) The applicant had a State of Hawai‘i General 
excise tax license and transient accommodations tax license for the purpose of the lawful operation of single -family transient vacation 
rentals for a period long enough to demonstrate actual payment of taxes.  
 
(2) That prior to the effective date of this ordinance, applicant had deposits for reservations 
by transient guests in exchange for compensation 
for use of subject property as a vacation rental.  
(3) That applicant had transient guests occupy subject property in exchange for compensation prior to the 
effective date of this ordinance, with a pattern 
of consistency that evidences an ongoing and 
lawful enterprise.   
 
KCC § 8-17.10(c) (2010) (formatting altered). 
KCC § 8-17.10(d) permitted nonconforming use 
certificates for land in a gricultural districts if the single-
family transient vacation rental was built before June 4, 1976 or 
the applicant obtained a n HRS § 205-6 special permit:

 Applications for nonconforming use certificates for 
single-family transient vacation rentals located on land 
designated "Agricultural" pursuant to [HRS C hapter 205] shall 
be made within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this 
ordinance.  If an operator as defined under Section 8-
17.10(c) fails to apply for a nonconforming use certificate within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this 
ordinance, then the Planning Director shall assess an 
administrative late application processing fee of Fifteen 
Hundred ($1,500.00) Dollars at filing.  A nonconforming use 
certificate may be issued for a single- family transient 
vacation rental located on land in the State of Hawaii's l and 
use agricultural district if : 
 
(1) It was built prior to June 4, 1976, or  
 
(2) The Applicant has obtained a special permit under [HRS §] 205-6 which specifically permits a 
vacation rental on the subject property.  
 
(A) An application for a special permit shall 
include verification by the Applicant that the farm dwelling unit was being used as a vacation 
rental on an ongoing basis in accordance with 
Section 8- 17.10(c). 
 
(B) An application for a special permit 
pursuant to [HRS §] 205- 6 and Chapter 13 of the 
Rules of Practice and Procedures of the Planning 
Commission that is deemed complete by the 
Planning Director must be filed within one (1) year of the effective date of this ordinance.  
Upon completion of the application, the Planning 
Director shall issue a provisional certificate 
that will allow the transient vacation rental to 
operate.  The provisional certificate shall be null and void after the Planning Commission or 
the Land Use Commission makes a decision upon 
the application. 
 
(C) In addition to the Special Permit 
standards set forth in [HRS §] 205 -6 and 
Chapter 13 of the Rules of Practice and 
Procedure of the Planning Commission, the 
Planning Commission may only grant a special 
permit if, prior to March 7, 2008:  (1) the 
property upon which the transient vacation 
rental is located had a registered agricultural dedication pursuant to the guidelines set forth 
in the County of [Kauai's] Department of Finance 
Real Property Tax Division Agricultural 
Dedication Program Rules; (2) a bona fide 
agricultural operation existed, as shown by 
State General Excise Tax Forms and/or Federal

 the property, or other circumstances, did not 
allow an applicant to qualify for an 
agricultural dedication pursuant to the County 
of [Kauai's] Department of Finance Real Property 
Tax Division Agricultural Dedication Program 
Rules or inhibited intensive agricultural activities[.] 
(D) If the application for the special permit 
is granted, then the transient vacation rental operation shall be subject to conditions imposed by the Planning Commission or the Land Use 
Commission.  
 (E) If the application for special permit is 
denied, then the nonconforming use certificate 
shall not be issued and the transient vacation 
rental must cease operation.    
 
KCC § 8-17.10(d) (2010) (formatting altered and emphase s added). 
KCC § 8-17.10(e) placed the burden of proof on the 
owner: 
The owner, operator, or proprietor shall have the 
burden of proof in establishing that the use is properly 
nonconforming based on the following documentation which 
shall be provided to the Planning Director as evidence of a 
nonconforming use:  records of occupancy and tax documents, 
including all relevant State of Hawai‘ i general excise tax 
filings, all relevant transient accommodations tax filings, federal and/or State of 
Hawai‘i income tax returns for the 
relevant time period, reservation lists, and receipts showing  
payment.  Other reliable information may also be provided.  
Based on the evidence submitted, the Planning Director shall 
determine whether to issue a nonconforming use certificate 
for the single -family transient vacation rental.  
 
KCC § 8-17.10(e) (2008 and 2010).  
KCC § 8-17.11  addressed the "Enforcement Against 
Illegal Transient Vacation Rentals": 
(a) In addition to other penalties provided by law, 
including but not limited to Section 8- 17.6, Section 8 -24.1 
and the Planning Commission Rules, as amended, the Planning 
Director , or any member of the public who has duly obtained 
standing pursuant to rules promulgated by the commission, may 
initiate proceedings to revoke or modify the terms of a 
nonconforming use certificate pursuant to the Rules of 
Practice and Procedures of the Planning Commission, as 
amended.  Violations of conditions of approval or providing FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 false or misleading information on the application or in any 
information relating thereto at any time during the 
application process shall be grounds for revocation or cease

(b) Advertising of any sort which offers a property 
as a transient rental shall constitute prima facie evidence 
of the operation of a transient vacation rental on said 
property and the burden of proof shall be on the owner, 
operator, or lessee to establish that the subject property is 
not being used as a transient vacation rental or that it is being used for such purpose legally.  If any unit is found to 
be operating unlawfully, penalties established in Section 8 -
17.6 and Section 8- 24.1 shall apply.
   
 
KCC § 8-17.11 (2010) (cleaned up).   The penalty for  a violation

 B. The Planning C ommission's Decision Did Not Violate the KCC 
or Campos's Rights 
 
 1. KCC's Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance 
 
Campos asserts that "the Planning Commission's decision 
violates the express provisions and intent of CZO Article 17."  
(Formatting altered.)  In particular, Campos takes issue with 
"the County's insistence that in order to apply for [ a 
nonconforming use certificate] the structure must be a 'legal' 
structure, " and argues that "neither the express provisions in 
KCC Article 17 nor the express intent of KCC Article 17 require or support this interpretation."  Campos further asserts that "it 
is undisputed that the guest cottage was a single family 
dwelling" because it contained a kitchen.  (Formatting altered.)  
"[Z]oning laws and ordinances are strictly construed, 
as they are in derogation of the common law, and their provisions may not be extended by implication."  Waikiki Marketplace Inv.

Honolulu , 86 
Hawai‘i 343, 354, 949 P.2d 183, 194 (App. 1997) 
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted) .  "The key to 
interpreting a zoning statute is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent as expressed in the statute."  3C Singer, 
Sutherland Statutory Construction § 77:7; see Kauai Springs, Inc. 
v. Plan. Comm'n of Cnty. of Kaua‘ i, 133 Hawai‘ i 141, 163, 324 P.3d 
951, 973 (2014) ("When construing a statute, our foremost FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
30 
 obligation is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of 
the legislature which is to be obtained primarily from the 
language contained in the statute itself." ) (citation omitted). 
"It is fundamental in statutory construction that each 
part or secti
on of a statute should be construed in connection 
with every other part or section so as to produce a harmonious whole."  Id. (citation omitted).  "We must read statutory 
language in the context of the entire statute and construe it in 
a manner consistent with its purpose."  Id. (citation omitted).      
We begin our analysis with KCC § 8-17.10(a), which 
explained the  purpose of the "Nonconforming Use Certificates for 
Single-Family Vacation Rentals" section was "to provide a process 
to identify and register those single- family transient vacation 
rentals as nonconforming uses which have been in lawful use prior to the effective date of this ordinance and to allow them to 
continue subject to obtaining a nonconforming use certificate as 
provided by this section."  (Emphasis added.)  "This purpose is consistent with the requirements of HRS § 46- 4(a) as well as the 
constitutional protection provided to property owners with vested rights to pre -existing lawful uses of their property."  Robert D. 
Ferris Tr. v. Plan. Comm'n of Cnty . of Kaua‘i, 138 Hawai‘i 307, 
313, 378 P.3d 1023, 1029 (App. 2016).   
Next, KCC § 8-17.10(c) provided, "No nonconforming use 
certificate shall be issued by the Planning Director unless the FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
31 
 use as a single- family rental is a l egal use under the 
Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance, and the applicant provides a 
sworn affidavit and demonstrates to the satisfaction of the 
Planning Director that a dwelling unit was being used as a 
vacation rental on an ongoing basis prior to March 7, 2008 . . . ."
8  (Cleaned up and emphase s added.)   This section also 
protected preexisting lawful use by exempting those legal single-
family rentals from the mandatory prohibition on issuing 
nonconforming use certificates  for transient vacation rentals on 
property outside the Visitor Destination Areas.  See Leslie v. 
Bd. of Appeals of Cnty. of Hawai‘ i, 109  384, 393, 126 Hawai‘i
P.3d 1071, 1080 (2006) ( explaining that the term " shall," "is 
generally imperative or mandatory" ) (citation omitted). 
Finally,  KCC § 8-17.10(d)  provided the Planning 
Department with the discretion to issue a nonconforming use 
certificate for a single-family transient vacation rental located on agricultural land under certain circumstances:
  
 
8  In Campos's argument, he asserts that COL 4 is incorrect.  COL 4 
states in relevant part, "[i]n order to qualify for the [nonconforming use  
certificate], the 'dwelling unit . . . [must be] in compliance with all State 
and County land use and planning laws . . . [as of] the time of application 
for' that nonconforming use certificate" and cites KCC § 8- 17.10(b).  
(Formatting altered.) 
 This quoted language was present in KCC § 8- 17.10(c) (in effect from 
March 7, 2008 to August 16, 2010), but was not in KCC § 8- 17.10(b) and was 
deleted by Ordinance No. 904.  Any error, however, does not require vacating 
the circuit court's decision because KCC §§ 8- 17.10(a) and (c) nonetheless 
require that the single- family rental be a prior lawful and legal use under 
the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance. FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
32 
 A nonconforming use certificate may be issued for a 
single-family transient vacation rental located on land in 
the . . . land use agricultural district if:   
 
(1) [i]t was built prior to June 4, 1976, or  
 
(2) [t]he Applicant has obtained a special permit 
under [HRS §] 205- 6 which specifically permits a vacation 
rental on the subject property.  
 
(A) An application for a special permit shall 
include verification by the Applicant that the farm dwelling unit was being used as a 
vacation rental on an ongoing basis in 
accordance with Section 8- 17.10(c) . . . .
 
 
KCC § 8-17.10(d) (emphasis added).  An application for a special 
permit requires that the dwelling unit was being used in accordance 
with KCC § 8-17.10(c), which includes being " a legal use under the 
Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance [.]" 
In short, when viewing KCC § 8 -17.10 as a whole  within 
the context of its purpose, a nonconforming use certificate  for a 
transient vacation rental outside of the Visitor Destination Area 
could be issued only when the prior use as a single -family 
transient vacation rental  was lawful under the Comprehensive 
Zoning Ordinance.  Thus, on land (agricultural or not) outside 
the Visitor Destination Area, prior lawful use was protected.   
With this in mind, we turn to KCC § 8- 19.1, which 
provided that "[n]o person shall . . . obtain a building permit . . . without first obtaining the required zoning permit."  
Similarly, KCC § 8- 20.2 provided that "[n]o person shall . . . 
obtain a building permit . . . without first obtaining a Use FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
33 
 Permit" where a use permit is required.  As such, no person is 
allowed to obtain a building permit for construction or use  
without first obtaining the required zoning permit and, if 
applicable, use permit. 
We pause to reiterate that nonconforming use means "a 
lawful use of a building or land existing at the adoption of" the 
ordinance,  transient vacation rental means a "dwelling unit  . . .  
provided to transient occupants for compensation, " a dwelling or 
dwelling unit contains facilities for cooking or a kitchen, and a 
guest house has no kitchen.  
Here, there was no single -family transient vacation 
rental in lawful use, pursuant to the zoning laws,  to identify or 
register as a nonconforming use.  
The Planning Commission found that Potts was issued a 
Zoning Permit to build the Guest House in July 1998  on the 
Property .  FOF 3.   Potts was also issued a zoning permit to build 
a Gazebo a few months later, in September 1998, and "[n]o other 
zoning permits were issued by the Planning Department for the 
Subject Property after approval of the Gazebo."  FOF 4. 
In 2000, the Public Works Department approved the 
Building Plans for the Guest House , however, the Building Plans 
differed from the Zoning Plans as the Building Plans showed a 
kitchen in the Guest House.  FOF 5.  In 2010, t he As-Built Plans  
submitted also depicted a kitchen in the Guest House.  FOF 10.  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
34 
 In 2011, a field inspection of the Guest House confirmed there 
was a kitchen.  FOF 12.   And in 2015, Campos advertised the Guest 
House as containing "a kitchen with a refrigerator, stove top 
burner, oven, dishwasher, blender, ice maker, coffee maker and 
toaster."  FOF 17. 
The Zoning Permit allowed  for a guest house (i.e., 
building with no kitchen for use of guests) on the Property.  In 
other words, the Guest House was supposed to be used as a place 
for guests, not as a single- family dwelling or a dwelling unit.  
See KCC § 8- 1.5.  Per the zoning code, Potts was prohibited from 
obtaining a build ing permit to construct or use a structure  with 
a kitchen if he did not first obtain the required zoning permit.   
See KCC § 8- 19.1.  A kitchen built in contravention to the Zoning 
Plans and Zoning Permit obtained did not convert use of the Guest 
House into a lawful use as a single-family dwelling .    
Thus, contrary to Campos's contention, there was no 
single
-family transient vacation rental in lawful use because his 
use of the Guest House as a single -family transient vacation 
rental was not a lawful use of the Guest House as permitted by 
the Zoning Permit.

 2. Grandfather Rights 
 
Second, Campo
s asserts that the "Planning Commission's 
decision violates [his] grandfather rights under the U.S. and 
[Hawaiʻi] State Constitutions and HRS section 46- 4."  (Formatting 
altered.)  He argues that "there is no evidence to dispute [his] 
testimony and records that he was operating a [transient vacation 
rental] on the Subject Property prior to March 7, 2008" and that 
the "government cannot stop an existing nonconforming use by the 
adoption of an ordinance prohibiting that use."  
The Hawaiʻ i Constitution provides that "[n]o person 
shall be
 deprived of life, liberty or property without due 
process of law . . . ."  Haw. Const. art. I, § 5; see U .S. Const . 
amend. V (providing same).  HRS § 46-4 grants zoning power to the 
counties, and in line with the Hawaiʻ i Constitution, provides that 
"[n]either this section nor any ordinance enacted pursuant to 
this section shall prohibit the continued lawful use of any 
building or premises for any trade, industrial, residential, 
agricultural, or other purpose for which the building or premises 
is used at the time this section or the ordinance takes effect[.]"  HRS § 46- 4(a)(12) (Supp. 2016)  (emphasis added) . 
Campos rented  his Guest House as a single-family 
dwelling  to transient vacationers.  Campos insists that the Guest  
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 House is really a single-family dwelling because it has a 
kitchen.   
However, as discussed above, the Zoning Permit issued 
by the Planning Department allowed  for a guest house (i.e., a 
building with no kitchen for use by guests ) on the Property.  
Because Campos did not use the Guest House as permitted by the 
Zoning Permit, it was not being used lawfully.  Thus, there was 
no lawful single-family transient vacation rental use which could 
be grandfathered. 
3. Due Process Rights 
 
Third, Campos contends that "the Planning Department is 
violating [his] due process rights as well as its own past practice of allowing [nonconforming use certificate] applicants 
to correct identified violations."  (Formatting altered.)  Campos 
argues that the "presence or absence of structural violations was 
not a factor" and "[i]f structural violations were found, the 
applicants were told to fix them."  Campos explains that the 
"issue is whether or not the County allowed an applicant to 
correct a violation prior to issuing the [nonconforming use 
certificate], not whether the guest house itself was the 
[transient vacation rental]."  
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 Campos also argues that the Planning Commission's 
"application of this 'new' requirement that the structures cannot 
be in violation of the KCC is a rule that cannot be enforced."  
Campos further states "there is nothing in the record to even 
remotely suggest that the Planning Commission's new rule requiring the structures in which a transient vacation rental is 
located to be free from violations was properly promulgated."  
The "requirements of due process are flexible and 
depend on many factors, but 'there are certain fundamentals of 
just procedure which are the same for every type of tribunal and every type of proceeding,' including those before administrative agencies."  Mauna Kea Anaina Hou v. Bd. of Land & Nat. Res., 136 
Hawaiʻi 376, 389, 363 P.3d 224, 237 (2015) (citations and 
brackets omitted).  "The basic elements of procedural due process are notice and an opportunity to be heard at a 
meaningful time and in a meaningful manner."  Id.  Also, "due 
process of law generally prohibits decisionmakers from being biased, and more specifically, prohibits decisionmakers from prejudging matters and the appearance of having prejudged matters."  Id.  Substantive due process "guards against 
arbitrary and capricious government action."  DW Aina Leʻ a Dev., 
LLC v. Bridge Aina Leʻ a, LLC., 134 Hawai‘ i 187, 219, 339 P.3d 
685, 717 (2014) (citation omitted). 
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
38 
 Contrary to Campos's claim that the Planning Commission 
applied a new requirement, the Planning Commission relied on and 
applied the KCC.  As stated, KCC § 8- 17.10(a) explained its 
purpose was "to provide a process to identify and register those single-family transient vacation rentals as nonconforming uses 
which have been in lawful use prior to the effective date of this ordinance and to allow them to continue subject to obtaining a 
nonconforming use certificate as provided by this section."  (Emphasis added.)  In that vein, KCC § 8- 17.10(c) provided, "[n]o 
nonconforming use certificate shall be issued by the Planning Director unless the use as a single- family rental is a legal use 
under the [CZO], . . ."  (Emphasis added.)  Campos does not  claim 
KCC § 8-17.10 was not properly promulgated.  
Moreover, in revoking Campos's Provisional 
Nonconforming Use Certificate, the Planning Department notified 
Campos of the revocation, explained its reasons for the 
revocation, instructed Campos to discontinue any transient vacation rental use on the Property, and informed Campos of the possible penalties.
 
Campos appealed this decision and requested a public 
hearing.  A contested case hearing was held, and the Hearing Officer issued a report and recommendation.  The Planning Commission heard oral arguments, and issued its Findings of 
Fact, Conclusions of Law, Decision and Order.  Campos then FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
39 
 appealed to the circuit court, which heard oral arguments and 
entered its Decision and Order affirming the Planning Commission's decision.  Campos was therefore afforded a meaningful opportunity to be heard.
 
As to Campos's argument that he was not allowed to 
correct the violation, Campos cites to his Exhibit 33 (plans 
titled "Renovation + GH to SFR Conversion") and the testimony of 
his brother.  As an initial matter, Campos does not indicate 
where in the record he made the application to correct the 
violation or show that an appeal from the denial of the 
application is properly before this court.  And Campos does not 
dispute that his application to convert the Guest House to a 
single-family dwelling was submitted months after he appealed the 
Planning Department' s revocation of the Provisional Nonconforming 
Use Certificate.   Thus, this argument is deemed waived.  
Even if we considered Campos's argument in the context 
of this appeal,  Campos has not provided this court with any law, 
ordinance, or rule entitling him to convert his Guest House ( that 
does not comply with the Zoning Permit issued)  into a single-
family dwelling, and then have that conversion retroactively render the unlawful use of his  Guest House  into a lawful use as a 
single-family dwelling. 
As stated in an unchallenged finding, Planning 
Department Enforcement Supervisor Michael Laureta testified that FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
40 
 "in order for the Guest House to be approved as a 'Single-Family 
Transient Vacation Rental[,]' a public hearing by the [Planning] 
Commission would be required on [Campos's] Special Permit 
Application."  FOF 22.  The Planning Commission also noted that 
"for this reason, the Planning Department cannot simply allow 
[Campos] to submit an application at this time for retroactive 
approval of 'a guest house with a kitchen' as part of Z-437-98."9  
As such, Campos has not shown that denial of an application for 
"Renovation + GH to SFR Conversion" was a denial of his due 
process rights. 
Based on the record in this case, Campos was afforded 
notice and ample "opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time 
and in a meaningful manner."  Mauna Kea Anaina Hou, 136 Hawaiʻi 
at 389, 363 P.3d at 237.  And the Planning Commission's decision 
was not arbitrary and capricious. 
4. Fines 
Finally, Campos contends that the "County violated its 
own rules in fining" him.  (Formatting altered.)  Campos asserts 
that the "County's own regulations specifically states [sic] 
 
9  The summary of the transcripts from the contested case hearing stated 
that Campos's attorney, Jonathan Chun, " noted that Mr. Laureta testified 
earlier that there was another situation with a guest house with a kitchen 
and questioned if he applied for a [transient vacation rental] to which  
Mr.
 Laureta replied that he applied for two [transient vacation rentals], one 
for the main house and one for the guest cottage."  After removal of the  kitchen in the guest house, Mr. Chun questioned the Department's recommended 
approval to which Mr. Laureta replied that "the Commission wouldn't accept 
two applications.  The guest cottage could be used as an accessory bedroom, but couldn't be advertised separately from the main dwelling unit." FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
41 
 that fines can only be assessed after a notice of violation has 
been issued on the property" and the "record is devoid of any 
indication that a notice of violation was issued[.]"   
The Planning Department argues Campos waived this 
issue because he raised it for the first time in his reply brief 
to the circuit court.  In his reply on appeal, Campos states the 
"County ignores the fact that the issue regarding the County's 
own failure to follow its own rules in fining Campos was raised in the lower court" and cites "Amended RA, Volume 1, Part 2 of 2 
at p. 129[,]" which is Campos's reply brief to the circuit 
court.  
Points raised for the first time in a reply brief are 
deemed waived.  See Hawaii Ventures, LLC v. Otaka, Inc. 114 
Hawai‘i 438, 472 n.17, 164 P.3d 696, 730 n.17 (2007) (explaining 
that Appellant's "point of error is deemed waived for failure to 
present any argument in its opening brief in the first instance 
and presenting such arguments in its reply brief to which no 
answer could be made"). 
Moreover, Campos's argument to this court consists of 
one paragraph, which does not specifically identify or quote the rule on which he relies, but instead cites to "Amended RA, 
Volume 1, Part 1 a of 2 at p. 391."  See HRAP Rule 28(b)(8) 
(requiring the opening brief to provide the "rules pertaining to the points of error set out verbatim").  Campos's one-paragraph FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
42 
 argument also does not analyze how the rules in "Amended RA, 
Volume 1, Part 1 a of 2 at p. 391" apply to the facts of this 
case, and does not explain why the December 22, 2011 letter 
instructing him to stop using the Guest House as a transient 
vacation rental or face fines "up to $10,000 and/or up to 
$10,000 per day" was not sufficient notice of the fines he 
faced.      
IV. CONCLUSION 
In sum, Campos fails to show that he is entitled to 
relief under HRS § 91-14(g).  We thus affirm the circuit court's 
(1) June 13, 2017 Final Judgment, and (2) April 19, 2017 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Decision and Order.
