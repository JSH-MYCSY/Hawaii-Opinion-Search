APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 12-1-1666)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
Upon review of the record, it appears that:
(1) On July 11, 2017, Defendant-Appellant Nellie Nunez
Camero (Camero), pro se, filed the notice of appeal;
(2) On August 28, 2017, the circuit court clerk filed
the record on appeal, and the appellate clerk filed a notice of
entering case on calendar, indicating the statement of
jurisdiction and opening brief were due on or before September 7,
2017, and October 9, 2017, respectively.  Camero is not a
registered Judiciary Electronic Filing System User.  It is NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
unclear whether the appellate clerk conventionally served Camero
with the August 28, 2017 notice when it was entered;
(3) Camero did not file the statement of jurisdiction
or opening brief, or request an extension of time;
(4) On November 16, 2017, the appellate clerk notified
Camero that the time for filing the statement of jurisdiction and
opening brief had expired, the matter would be called to the
court's attention that same day for appropriate action, which
could include dismissal of the appeal, pursuant to Hawai #i Rules
of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rules 12.1(e) and 30, and Camero
may request relief from default by motion.  The appellate clerk
conventionally served Camero with the November 16, 2017 notice;
(5) On January 11, 2018, the appellate clerk
conventionally served Camero with the August 28, 2017 notice of
entering case on calendar, and a first amended default notice,
indicating the matter would be called to the court's attention on
January 22, 2018, for appropriate action, which could include
dismissal of the appeal, pursuant to HRAP Rules 12.1(e) and 30,
and that any request for relief from default should be made by
motion; and
(6) Camero took no further action in this appeal.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is
dismissed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai #i, February 16, 2018.
