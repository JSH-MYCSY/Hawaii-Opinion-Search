STATE OF HAWAI#I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
JIN WANG, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CR. NO. 15-1-1890)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant, Jin Wang (Wang) appeals from the
Circuit Court of the First Circuit's (Circuit Court) June 23,
2017 Judgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence; Notice of
Entry.  After a jury trial, the Circuit Court convicted Wang of
Count 1:  The included offense of Sexual Assault in the Third
Degree, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707-732(1)(c) (2014).21
1The Honorable Jeffrey P. Crabtree presided.
2Wang had been charged with Count 1:  Sexual Assault in the First
Degree, HRS § 707-730, and Count 2:  Sexual Assault in the Third Degree, HRS
§ 707-732(1)(c).  HRS § 707-732(1)(c) provides, 
(1) A person commits the offense of sexual assault in the
third degree if:
. . . .
(c) The person knowingly engages in sexual contact
with a person who is at least fourteen years old but
less than sixteen years old or causes the minor to
have sexual contact with the person; provided that:
(i) The person is not less than five years older
than the minor; and
(ii) The person is not legally married to the
minor[.]NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
On appeal, Wang contends that the Circuit Court erred
by holding that (1) knowledge of the age of the victim is not an
element of the offense of which he was convicted; and
(2) exclusion of his sister from the courtroom after her
testimony infringed upon his constitutional right to a public
trial.
After a careful review of the record on appeal and the
relevant legal authorities, and giving due consideration to the
points raised and the arguments made by the parties, we resolve
Wang's appeal as follows and affirm.
BACKGROUND
S.P. was 15 years old when she attended her friend's
mother's wedding reception in April 2015.  In full view of adult
wedding guests, S.P. drank five bottles of Heineken beer, which
made her "pretty drunk" and unable to walk straight.  Wang--a
friend of the groom--drove S.P. and her friends to the bride's
apartment after the reception.  S.P. remembers making a phone
call to her boyfriend, but otherwise has no recollection of being
carried up the stairs to the apartment or of what happened inside
the apartment.
S.P.'s first recollection is that she woke up in the
dark with a person next to her holding her breast and with his
fingers in her vagina.  She left the room and told her friends
what had happened.  S.P. and several other friends left, then
discussed the event at an ice cream parlor before going to the
police station to report the event.  The police officer S.P.
talked to testified that she did not appear "at all intoxicated." 
S.P. was taken to the hospital and given a pelvic exam.  Wang did
not testify.
1.  As thoroughly discussed in Buch, "a defendant is
strictly liable with respect to the attendant circumstance of the
victim's age in a sexual assault."  State v. Buch, 83 Hawai#i
308, 316, 926 P.2d 599, 607 (1996).  Therefore, Wang's knowledge
of S.P.'s age is not an element of the crime of sexual assault in
the third degree, HRS § 707-732(1)(c).  Because only the Hawai# i
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Supreme Court may revisit its own precedent, we decline to
consider Wang's point on appeal that Buch was wrongly decided.3
Wang offers no persuading precedent to support his
contention that imposing strict liability under Buch violates due
process by denying a person "reasonable notice of the proscribed
conduct so that a person can conform his conduct to the
requirements of the law."   The general rule is that the state of
mind requirement of a criminal statute "appl[ies] to all elements
of the offense, unless a contrary purpose plainly appears."  HRS
§ 702-207 (2014) (emphasis added); Buch, 83 4
Hawai#i at 318, 926
P.2d at 609.  The "contrary purpose" need not appear on the face
of the statute; rather, the contrary purpose may be derived from
the legislative history.  Commentary to HRS § 702-207.
The legislative history at the time Buch was decided
evinced the legislature's intent to "eliminate the requirement of
knowledge of the victim's age in those sex offenses where the
victim's age was an attendant circumstance."  Buch, 83 Hawai#i at
315-16, 926 P.2d at 606-07 (citing Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 1, in
1972 House Journal, at 1038).  In 2001, the legislature cited
Buch with approval when it amended HRS § 707-732 to
"[c]riminalize sexual penetration and sexual contact with a minor
who is age 14, if the actor is 19 years or older and not married
to the minor."  Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 66, in 2001 House Journal,
at 1072, 2001 Senate Journal, at 881.  The legislature explained
3Because Buch is controlling, we need not address Wang's contention
that State v. Silva, 53 Haw. 232, 491 P.2d 1216 (1971) is inapplicable and not
binding to this case.
4Wang contends that the "enlightened courts" in Alaska and Utah
"have adopted the philosophy of the Penal Code" and allow mistake of fact as a
defense to statutory rape instead of imposing strict liability.  As discussed
in U.S. v. Wilson, 66 M.J. 39, 43 (C.A.A.F. 2008), the cases Wang cites have
since been superseded by statute in their respective jurisdictions.  In Utah,
State v. Pappas, 705 P.2d 1169, 1171 (Utah 1985) and State v. Elton, 680, P.2d
717 (Utah 1984) were superseded by Utah Code Ann. § 76-2-304.5 (West, Westlaw
through 2019) (providing that mistake of fact as to the victim's age is not a
defense to unlawful sexual activity or sexual abuse of a minor). 
In Alaska, the legislature superseded State v. Guest, 583 P.2d 836
(Alaska 1973) upon which Wang relies, by making a reasonable belief that the
child was at or above the requisite age an affirmative, rather than ordinary
defense, and by adding the requirement that the defendant also prove he or she
took "reasonable measures to verify that the victim was that age or older[,]"
thus taking it out of the realm of "ignorance or mistake" of fact as defined
by the Hawai #i Statute.  Alaska Stat. Ann. § 11.41.445(b) (West, Westlaw
through 2019); HRS § 702-218.
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
that, under the amended HRS § 707-732, "[t]he term 'knowing'
relates to the act of sexual contact or penetration, not to the
knowledge of the child's age."  Id.  The legislature's reason for
the amendment to the statute included alleviating the minors'
"unfair[] burden[] with the presumption of knowing the
consequences of engaging in sexual relations with an adult,"
S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1394, in 2001 Senate Journal, at 1486,
and, instead, "plac[ing] the responsibility of correct behavior
upon adult sexual partners," H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 704, in
2001 House Journal, at 1388.  Therefore, the legislative history
provides the contrary purpose that prevents the state of mind
requirement of HRS § 707-732(1)(c) from being applied to the age
of the victim.
Wang contends that "[i]t is much easier to avoid having
sex with an 11 or 13 year old than a 15 year old," and imposing
strict liability protection for children ages 14 and 15--who can
legally have sex with others of similar age, as well as marry
with parental consent--has the effect of imposing criminal
liability upon "innocent people."  In other words, he appears to
urge us to ignore or invalidate subsection (1)(c) from HRS § 707-
732.  We must decline because
[i]t is a cardinal rule of statutory construction that
courts are bound, if rational and practicable, to give
effect to all parts of a statute, and that no clause,
sentence, or word shall be construed as superfluous, void,
or insignificant if a construction can be legitimately found
which will give force to and preserve all the words of the
statute.
Methven-Abreu v. Hawaiian Ins. & Guar. Co., Ltd., 73 Haw. 385,
392–93, 834 P.2d 279, 284 (1992) (emphases added) (quoting Camara
v. Agsalud, 67 Haw. 212, 215–16, 685 P.2d 794, 797 (1984)).
Furthermore, Wang's argument is based on a fact not in
evidence:  that S.P. purported to consent to sexual contact with
Wang.  Wang did not give S.P. an opportunity to consent or refuse
sexual contact.  Instead, S.P. woke up with one of Wang's hands
already on her breast and fingers of the other hand in her
vagina.  Whether S.P.'s age should allow her to decide for
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
herself if she wanted sexual contact with Wang is therefore a
moot point.5
2.  Wang contends that he was denied the right to a
public trial by the Circuit Court's exclusion of his sister from
the courtroom upon conclusion of her testimony.  There are two
rules at play here, which "serve unique and mutually inclusive
ends":  (1) the right to a public trial, as guaranteed by the
sixth and fourteenth amendments to the U.S. Constitution and
art. I, section 14 of the Hawai#i constitution; and (2) the
witness exclusionary rule under Hawaii Rules of Evidence Rule 615
("At the request of a party the court shall order witnesses
excluded so that they cannot hear the testimony of other
witnesses, and it may make the order of its own motion.")
(emphasis added).  State v. Culkin, 97 Hawai#i 206, 231 n.27, 35
P.3d 233, 258 n.27 (2001).
A public trial safeguards against secret trials and
allows "the public [to] see that a defendant is fairly dealt with
and not unjustly condemned."  Id. at 232, 35 P.3d at 259
(brackets omitted).  Here, the courtroom remained open to non-
testifying individuals, including Wang's parents; thus, the trial
was not held in secret.  The witness exclusionary rule safeguards
against witnesses shaping their testimony to match that of other
witnesses.  Id. at 231, 35 P.3d at 258.  Subject to the
exceptions specified in Hawaii Rules of Evidence Rule 615, which
Wang does not assert apply, witness exclusion under the rule "is
generally a matter of right."  See Bloudell v. Wailuku Sugar Co.,
4 Haw. App. 498, 505, 669 P.2d 163, 169 (1983).  Even though the
chance of her being called again to testify was slim, the Circuit
Court did not err in excluding her.   Because the "right to a
public trial is not implicated by the exclusion of a potential
witness pursuant to the witness exclusionary rule," Wang was not6

16 in most cases."  H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 568, in 2003 House Journal, at
1340.

during an off-the-record discussion.

denied a right to a public trial when his sister was excluded.
