NATIONAL TROPICAL BOTANICAL GARDENS, Employer-Appellee, and
ISLAND INSURANCE, Insurance Carrier-Appellee, and
NA OLA MANA, LLC., Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
(CASE NO. AB 2017-050(K) (DCD NO. 4-11-00600))
ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL
(By:  Reifurth, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.)
Upon consideration of Claimant-Appellee Princeton
Yamaguchi's (Yamaguchi) November 13, 2018 Motion to Dismiss
Appeal (Motion), the papers in support, the record, and there
being no opposition, it appears that:
(1) On September 15, 2017, the Chief Clerk of the Labor
and Industrial Relations Appeals Board filed the record on
appeal;
(2) On September 18, 2017, the appellate clerk notified
the parties that the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief
were due on or before September 25, 2017, and October 25, 2017,
respectively;NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(3) Appellant-Appellant Na Ola Mana, LLC (Na Ola Mana)
failed to file the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief,
or request an extension for either document;
(4) On November 13, 2018, Yamaguchi filed the instant
Motion to dismiss the appeal, under Hawai#i Rules of Appellate
Procedure (Rule) 30, for failure to file the statement of
jurisdiction and opening brief;
(5) A response to the Motion was due on or before
November 20, 2018, see HRAP Rules 26(a) & 27(a), but none was
filed;
(6) On March 7, 2019, the appellate clerk entered a
notice of default for the statement of jurisdiction and opening
brief, indicating the matter would be called to the court's
attention on March 18, 2019, for action that could include
dismissal, under HRAP Rules 12.1(e) and 30, and Na Ola Mana could
seek relief from default by motion;
(7) The appellate clerk mailed the default notice to Na
Ola Mana at the address indicated in the notice of appeal and
record on appeal.  The United States Postal Service returned the
notice as undeliverable.  Na Ola Mana has not filed a notice of
change of address, as required by HRAP Rule 25(f), and it took no
further action in this appeal; and
(8) HRAP Rule 12.1(e) (2018) states, "Failure to file a
statement of jurisdiction may result in sanctions, including
dismissal of the appeal following notice and a meaningful
opportunity to be heard."  HRAP Rule 30 (2018) provides, in part:
When the brief for appellant is not filed within the time
required, the appellate clerk shall forthwith give notice to
the parties that the matter will be called to the attention
of the appellate court on a day certain for such action as
the appellate court deems proper and that the appeal may be
dismissed.
Because Na Ola Mana failed to file the statement of jurisdiction
and opening brief within the time required, failed to file a
notice of change of address as required by HRAP Rule 25(f),

and took no further action in this appeal, the court will grant
the instant Motion.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is
granted and the appeal is dismissed.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, March 20, 2019.
