memorandum in opposition to Nickens and CBIP's December 7, 2017
motion to dismiss, and (4) the record, it appears that we lack
appellate jurisdiction over the Appellants' appeal from the
Honorable Kathleen N.A. Watanabe's June 19, 2017 interlocutory
order of dismissal in Civil No. 13-1-0032 because the circuit
court has not yet resolved all claims as to all parties through a
separate judgment, as Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a)
(2016) and Rule 58 of the Hawai #i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP)
require under the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming &
Wright, 76 Hawai #i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994).
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals to the Hawaii
Intermediate Court of Appeals from civil circuit court final
judgments, orders, or decrees.  Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall
be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." 
HRS § 641-1(c).  HRCP Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment
shall be set forth on a separate document."  Based on HRCP 
Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai #i held that "[a]n appeal may
be taken from circuit court orders resolving claims against
parties only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and
the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the
appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]"  Jenkins , 
76 Hawai #i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338.  "Thus, based on Jenkins and
HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all
claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a
separate judgment."  Carlisle v. One (1) Boat , 119 Hawai #i 245,
254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008).  When interpreting the
requirements for an appealable final judgment under HRS 
§ 641-1(a) and HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai #i has
explained that#
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its
face
 all of the issues in the case, the burden of
searching the often voluminous circuit court record to
verify assertions of jurisdiction is cast upon this
court.  Neither the parties nor counsel have a right
to cast upon this court the burden of searching a
voluminous record for evidence of finality, . . . and
we should not make such searches necessary by allowing
the parties the option of waiving the requirements of
HRCP [Rule] 58.

Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai #i at 119, 
869 P.2d at 1338 (citation omitted; original emphasis). 
Consequently, "an order disposing of a circuit court case is
appealable when the order is reduced to a separate  judgment." 
Alford v. City and Count of Honolulu , 109 Hawai #i 14, 20, 122
P.3d 809, 815 (2005) (citation omitted; emphasis added).  "An
appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor
or against the party by the time the record is filed in the
supreme court will be dismissed."  Jenkins v. Cades Schutte
Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai #i at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote
omitted).
On September 15, 2017, the circuit court clerk filed
the record on appeal for CAAP-17-0000554, which does not contain
a separate judgment resolving all claims as to all parties. 
Furthermore, the record does not clearly indicate that the
circuit court intends to enter a final judgment at this time,
because the circuit court has not yet dismissed all claims as to
all parties in Civil No. 13-1-0032.  For example, neither the
June 19, 2017 order of dismissal nor any other order dismissed
Defendants/Third-Party Plaintiffs/Appellees Gary R. Fischer,
Samantha K. Fischer, and Anini Aloha Properties, Inc.'s, June 3,
2013 third-party complaint as to Third-Party Defendant/Appellee
Amy J. Marvin, which, thus, is a claim that is still unresolved
and pending before the circuit court.
Absent a separate and appealable final judgment that
resolves all claims as to all parties or a judgment entered
pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b), we lack appellate jurisdiction, and
the Appellants' appeal is premature.
