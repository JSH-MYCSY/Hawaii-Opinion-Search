APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUITNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
Upon review of (1) Defendant-Appellant Marcus D.E.
Rosehill's (Marcus Rosehill) appeal from the Honorable Keith K.
Hiraoka's June 28, 2017 order denying Marcus Rosehill's motion
for relief from the September 1, 2011 judgment in the 
underlying consolidated cases of Civil No. 07-1-2393-12, 
Civil No. 06-1-1982-11 and Civil No. 06-1-1976-11, and (2) the
record, it appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction over this
appeal.  This court held in CAAP-11-0000723 that the September 1,
2011 judgment failed to satisfy the requirements for an
appealable final judgment, and thus, the subsequent June 28, 2017
order is an interlocutory order that is not yet eligible for
appellate review.
As we explained in the January 31, 2012 order
dismissing Marcus Rosehill's appeal from the September 1, 2011
judgment in CAAP-11-0000723, the September 1, 2011 judgment
neither resolves all claims from all three consolidated cases nor
contains a finding of no just reason for delay in the entry of
judgment as to one or more but fewer than all claims or parties
pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Hawai #i Rules of Civil Procedure
(HRCP), as Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-1(a) (2016) and
HRCP Rule 58 require for an appeal from a civil circuit court
case.  See Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai# i
115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994) (Holding that, to be
appealable, a judgment must "either resolve all claims against
all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification
under HRCP [Rule] 54(b).");  Leslie v. Estate of Tavares, 
109 Hawai #i 8, 13, 122 P.3d 803, 808 (2005) (Holding that "a
judgment or order in a consolidated case, disposing of fewer than
all claims among all parties, is not appealable in the absence of
[HRCP] Rule 54(b) certification.").
Although Marcus Rosehill later sought relief from the
September 1, 2011 judgment, purportedly pursuant to HRCP 
Rule 60(b), the Supreme Court of Hawai# i "hold[s] that relief
under HRCP Rule 60(b) requires an underlying judgment that
comports with the principles of finality set forth in Jenkins. 
-2-NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Absent an underlying appealable final judgment, the circuit
court's rulings on a purported Rule 60(b) motion are
interlocutory and not appealable until entry of such a judgment." 
Bailey v. DuVauchelle , 135 Hawai #i 482, 491, 353 P.3d 1024, 1033
(2015).  Because the September 1, 2011 judgment is not  an
appealable final judgment that comports with the principles of
finality set forth in Jenkins , the circuit court's subsequent
June 28, 2017 post-judgment order denying Marcus Rosehill's
March 29, 2017 post-judgment HRCP Rule 60(b) motion for relief
from the September 1, 2011 judgment is an interlocutory order
that will not be eligible for review until the circuit court
enters an appealable final judgment.
We are aware that under the holding in Waikiki v.
Ho#omaka Village Association of Apartment Owners, 140 Hawai #i 197,
398 P.3d 786 (2017), the Supreme Court of Hawai #i now 
hold[s] that when a party to a circuit court civil case
timely appeals a purportedly appealable final judgment later
determined not to meet Jenkins requirements, rather than
dismiss the appeal, the ICA must temporarily remand the case
to the circuit court "in aid of its jurisdiction" pursuant
to HRS ยง 602-57(3) (2016) for entry of an appealable final
judgment with a direction to the circuit court to supplement
the record on appeal with the final judgment.
State v. Joshua, 141 Hawai #i 91, 93, 405 P.3d 527, 529 (2017)
(footnote omitted).  Nevertheless, when we review the record, we
do not see any motion by a party, nor any indication by the
circuit court, that reflects the intent by the circuit court to
certify the September 1, 2011 judgment for an appeal pursuant to
HRCP Rule 54(b).  See Arimizu v. Fin. Sec. Ins. Co. , 5 Haw. App.
106, 112, 679 P.2d 627, 633 (1984) ("Rule 54(b) does not
prescribe any procedure for obtaining a certificate.  Although
the normal procedure is to request such certification by motion,
a trial court may consider the matter sua sponte in an
appropriate case.  See  10 Wright, Miller & Kane ยง 2660.").  In
the absence of any indication that the circuit court intended to
certify the September 11, 2011 judgment for an appeal pursuant to
HRCP Rule 54(b), we will not supplant the discretion of the
circuit court to certify a judgment as to one or more but fewer
-3-NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
than all claims or parties for an appeal pursuant to HRCP 
Rule 54(b).  Thus, we conclude that the holdings in Waikiki  and
Joshua do not apply under these circumstances.  In the absence of
an appealable final judgment, Marcus Rosehill's appeal is
premature and we lack appellate jurisdiction.
 Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case
number CAAP-17-0000558 is dismissed for lack of appellate
jurisdiction.
