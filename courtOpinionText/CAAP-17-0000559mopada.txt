OF THE STATE OF HAWAI#I
IVAN W.K. AUYOUNG and BEVERLY A. AUYOUNG, Appellants-Appellees,
v. DEPARTMENT OF BUDGET AND FISCAL SERVICES,
CITY AND COUNTY OF HONOLULU, Appellee-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 16-1-1278)
MEMORANDUM OPINION
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Hiraoka, JJ.)
In this secondary appeal, Appellee-Appellant Department
of Budget and Fiscal Services, City and County of Honolulu (BFS)
appeals from a June 27, 2017 Circuit Court of the First Circuit
(Circuit Court)1 Final Judgment and Order reversing BFS's
hearings officer's Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and
Decision and Order Dated June 13, 2016 (Judgment).
I.  BACKGROUND
The facts in this case are not in dispute.  The parties
in this case disagree on the statutory interpretation of Revised
Ordinances of Honolulu (ROH) § 8-13.1,2 with both claiming that
1The Honorable Rhonda A. Nishimura presided.
2ROH § 8-13.1 provides,
"Income" means the sum of federal total income as
defined in the Internal Revenue Code of the United States of
1954, as amended, and all nontaxable income, including but
not limited to (1) tax-exempt interest received from the
federal government or any of its instrumentalities, (2) the
gross amount of any IRA distribution, pension or annuity
(continued...)NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
their respective views support the legislative purpose of
protecting low-income homeowners. 
Homeowners Ivan W.K. AuYoung and Beverly A. AuYoung
(the AuYoungs) applied for a real property tax credit, claiming
that their income for tax year 2014 was below the $60,000 cap.3,4  
BFS's Treasury Division denied their application, stating that,
when including the AuYoungs' Roth IRA distributions, their income
in 2014 was in excess of $60,000.  The BFS's hearings officer
affirmed the Treasury Division's denial of the application,
ruling that the definition of income under ROH § 8-13.1 included
the Roth IRA distribution, relying on the language that income 
included
(2) the gross amount of any IRA distribution, pension or
annuity benefits received (including Railroad Retirement Act
benefits and veterans disability pensions), excluding
rollovers, (3) all payments received under the federal
Social Security and State unemployment insurance laws, (4)
nontaxable contributions to public or private pension,
annuity and/or deferred compensations plans[.]
The AuYoungs appealed the denial to the Circuit Court.

benefits received (including Railroad Retirement Act
benefits and veterans disability pensions), excluding
rollovers, (3) all payments received under the federal
Social Security and state unemployment insurance laws,
(4) nontaxable contributions to public or private pension,
annuity and/or deferred compensation plans, and (5) federal
cost of living allowances.  All income set forth in the tax
return filed by the titleholder, whether the tax return is a
joint tax return or an individual tax return, shall be
considered the titleholder's income.  "Income" does not
include nonmonetary gifts from private sources, or surplus
foods or other relief in kind provided by public or private
agencies.
3The AuYoungs submitted their joint 2014 United States Income Tax
Return, which reported that their Federal total gross income was $39,830,
pension dispersal was $23,156, and the distribution from their deferred
compensation account was $3,600, for a total of $66,586.
4 ROH § 8-13.2 provides, in part,
An owner is entitled to a real property tax credit
equal to the amount by which the taxes owed for the same tax
year in which the application is filed for the property
exceed three percent of the titleholders' income, provided:
. . . .
(3) The combined income of all titleholders of the
property for the calendar year immediately
preceding the date of the application does not
exceed $60,000[.]
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
In their appeal to the Circuit Court, the AuYoungs
argued, inter alia, that the ROH § 8-13.1 definition of income
did not mention Roth IRAs because they had not existed when the
provision was enacted and amended.  BFS pointed out that when ROH
§ 8-13.1's definition of income was amended to include IRAs in
2007, Roth IRAs had been in existence for over ten years.  After
the Circuit Court reviewed supplemental briefing from the parties
on the legislative history of the 2007 amendment to ROH § 8-13.1,
the Circuit Court reversed, holding that, 
APPELLANTS' ARGUMENT PRESENTS A MORE PERSUASIVE ARGUMENT OF
LEGISLATIVE INTENT. THE ENTIRE PURPOSE OF ARTICLE 13
SECTION 8 WAS TO PROVIDE RELIEF TO "LOW-INCOME HOMEOWNERS"
WHOSE COMBINED INCOME FOR A PARTICULAR PROPERTY DID NOT
EXCEED $60,000.00. THE PHRASE, "INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED"
CONTAINED WITHIN THE DEFINITION OF "INCOME" UNDER ROH SEC.
8-13.1 SERVES TO ILLUSTRATE EXAMPLES OF FINANCIAL PAYMENTS
THAT SHARE COMMON ATTRIBUTES OF BEING TAXABLE, E.G.
TRADITIONAL IRA DISTRIBUTIONS, PENSION, ANNUITY BENEFITS,
DEFERRED COMPENSATION, ETC. PURSUANT TO HRS SEC. 94-14(G),
THE HO'S [sic] DECISION IS REVERSED, SINCE THE SUBSTANTIAL
RIGHTS OF THE PETITIONERS "MAY HAVE BEEN PREJUDICED BECAUSE
THE . . . ORDER" WAS EITHER "[A]FFECTED BY OTHER ERROR LAW,"
OR "CHARACTERIZED BY ABUSE OF DISCRETION" IN THE
INTERPRETATION OF "INCOME" TO INCLUDE THE GROSS AMOUNT OF
THE ROTH DISTRIBUTION, RATHER THAN RESTRICTING IT TO ONLY
THAT PORTION OF THE ROTH DISTRIBUTION - [TAXABLE] INTEREST,
EXCLUDING THE INITIAL $20,000 WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN TAXED.
TO INCLUDE THE GROSS AMOUNT OF THE ROTH DISTRIBUTION WOULD
EASILY DEFEAT THE UNDERLYING LEGISLATIVE PURPOSE OF ROH
ARTICLE 8 SECTION 13 [sic], TO PROVIDE CERTAIN REAL PROPERTY
TAX RELIEF TO LOW-INCOME HOMEOWNERS WHOSE COMBINED INCOME
EXCEED $60,000.00.
II.  DISCUSSION
BFS's points of error essentially allege that the
Circuit Court erred in holding that the AuYoungs' Roth IRA
distributions were not "income."  BFS asserts that the AuYoungs'
Roth IRA distributions should be considered as income because
income under ROH § 8-13.1 includes contributions to all types of
IRAs--including Roth IRAs--in the tax year in which the
contribution is made, as well as distributions from the same in
the tax year in which the distribution is made.
The AuYoungs respond that, because the ROH § 8-13.1
definition of "income" is based upon the federal tax code, and
Roth distributions are not "income" under 26 U.S. Code § 61, the
2007 amendment to ROH § 8-13.1 would surely have listed Roth IRA
distributions as income if the intent was to obtain a contrary
result.  26 U.S.C.A. § 61 (West, Westlaw through Pub. L. No. 98-
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
369).  The AuYoungs further assert that, if one follows BFS's
logic that any numbers under the income heading on a federal tax
return transcript is to be considered income for purposes of a
real property tax credit, then BFS wrongly excluded from its
calculation the AuYoungs' annuities and pensions.
We review the Circuit Court's decision to determine
whether the circuit court was right or wrong in its decision,
applying the standards set forth in HRS § 91-14(g) (2012) to the
agency's decision.  United Pub. Workers, AFSCME, Local 646, AFL-
CIO, v. Hanneman, 106 Hawai #i 359, 363, 105 P.3d 236, 240 (2005).
Under HRS § 91-14(g),5 an agency's conclusions of law are
reviewed de novo.  Id. 
The plain language supports the BFS's interpretation. 
"Where the language of the statute is plain and unambiguous, our
only duty is to give effect to its plain and obvious meaning." 
Sierra Club v. Dep't of Trans. of State of Hawai#i, 120 Hawai# i
181, 197, 202 P.3d 1226, 1242 (2009).  When simplifying the
language to the provisions at issue, the ordinance defines income
as "the sum of federal total income as defined in the Internal
Revenue Code . . . and all nontaxable income, including . . . the
gross amount of any IRA distribution[.]"  ROH § 8-13.1 (emphases
5HRS § 91-14, entitled "Judicial review of contested cases,"
provides in relevant part:  
(g) Upon review of the record the court may affirm the
decision of the agency or remand the case with instructions
for further proceedings; or it may reverse or modify the
decision and order if the substantial rights of the
petitioners may have been prejudiced because the
administrative findings, conclusions, decisions, or orders
are: 
(1)In violation of constitutional or statutory
provisions; or 
(2)In excess of the statutory authority or jurisdiction
of the agency; or 
(3)Made upon unlawful procedure; or 
(4)Affected by other error of law; or 
(5)Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative,
and substantial evidence on the whole record; or 
(6)Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized by
abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted
exercise of discretion.

added).  Thus, even if an IRA distribution is nontaxable for
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax return purposes--such as a
Roth IRA distribution6--to calculate whether the homeowner
qualifies for a tax credit, the non-taxable distribution will be
added to the total taxable income.   
The legislative history further supports and clarifies
this interpretation of ROH § 8-13.1.  In 2007, the City Council
proposed an amendment to ROH § 8-13.1, which involved, inter
alia, changing the starting point for the definition of income
from the "federal adjusted gross income" to "federal total
income" as defined in the Internal Revenue Code.7  City Council

http://www4.honolulu.gov/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-63957/2d4f-
qpv.pdf (last visited on Mar. 18, 2019).  The Director of BFS
submitted testimony that clearly explained how the proposed
amendment would affect the definition of income.8  The testimony
included a spreadsheet, which showed that, for the purposes of
calculating income, the starting point would change from the
6Under the Internal Revenue Code, Roth IRA distributions "shall not
be includible in gross income" and are therefore generally non-taxable.  26
U.S.C.A. § 408A(d)(1) (West, Westlaw through Pub. L. No. 110-458). 
Notwithstanding the non-taxable nature, all Roth IRA distributions must be
reported on IRS Form 1040 at line 15a, i.e., "IRA distributions."  See IRS
Form 1040 (2006) Instructions at 25. 
7Bill 38 provided, in relevant part,
"Income" means the sum of federal [adjusted gross] total
income as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of the United
States of 1954, as amended, and all nontaxable income,
including but not limited to [the amount of capital gains
excluded from adjusted gross income, alimony, support money,
nontaxable strike benefits, cash public assistance and
relief (not including relief granted under this article),]
(1) tax-exempt interest received from the federal government
or any of its instrumentalities, (2) the gross amount of any
IRA distribution, pension or annuity benefits received
(including Railroad Retirement Act benefits and veterans
disability pensions), excluding rollovers[.]

number listed as "adjusted gross income" on line 37 to the number
listed as "total income" on line 22 on IRS Form 1040.  Testimony
at 2-3.  Thus, the starting point under both the pre- and post-
amendment versions of the ordinance included IRA distributions
(line 15a) only if those distributions are taxable by the IRS
(line 15b).
At the time of the 2007 amendment, Roth IRAs had been
in existence for approximately a decade.  Thus, we can assume
that the City Council was aware that Roth IRA distributions are
generally non-taxable by the federal government.  The 2007
amendment required, under subsection (2), that the gross amount
of "any IRA distribution" be added to the federal total income. 
By use of the word "any," the City Council clearly intended for
all IRA distributions not already included under "total income"
to be considered income for the purpose of real property tax
credit calculations.  Thus, the BFS properly added the AuYoungs'
Roth IRA distributions to their federal total income, which
resulted in the sum of $66,586 for purposes of determining
eligibility for a tax credit.9 
The amendment is consistent with, and furthers the
legislative purpose behind, offering a tax credit under ROH § 8-
13.2(3) to low-income homeowners who likely do not have access to
the cash needed to pay real property taxes.  Although the
AuYoungs' other income for real property tax purposes was below
$60,000, after distributions from the Roth IRA, the AuYoungs had
access to $66,586.  Thus, the AuYoungs are not in the group of
homeowners with access to less than $60,000 that ROH § 8-13.2(3)
was created to protect.
9 By contrast, the AuYoungs' gross pensions and annuities
distributions of $848,205 were properly excluded by BFS.  Although these
pensions and annuities, like the Roth IRA distributions, are non-taxable for
IRS purposes and would normally have been added to the AuYoungs' total income
under ROH § 8-13.1(2), the BFS determined that they are rollovers, which are
specifically excluded from calculation of income under the same ROH provision
in accordance with the 2007 amendment.  From the IRS transcript of the
AuYoungs' Form 1040 tax return, it appears that the AuYoungs received $848,205
in pensions and annuities, of which $0 was taxable to the IRS.  In its audit,
the FSB determined that these were "rollovers, exchanges".

The Circuit Court was incorrect when it held Roth IRA
distributions were not income for the purposes of ROH § 8-13.1.

Circuit is reversed.
