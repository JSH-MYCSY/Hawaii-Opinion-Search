IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v. RONALD BRACK, JR.,
also known as BABA, and LYLE BOTELHO, Defendants-Appellees,
and ABOVE ALL BAIL BONDS, Real Party in Interest-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CR. NO. 15-1-1404)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Fujise, Acting Chief Judge, Reifurth and Chan, JJ.)
Real Party in Interest-Appellant Above All Bail Bonds
(AABB) appeals from the June 22, 2017 "Order Denying [AABB's]
Second Motion to Set Aside Bail Forfeiture Reinstate Bond Then
Discharge Bond" (Order Denying Motion) entered by the Circuit
Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court).1
On appeal, AABB argues that the Circuit Court erred by
denying AABB's motion on the basis that it lacked jurisdiction
over the motion.
After a careful review and consideration of the point
raised and arguments made by the parties, the record, and the
applicable authority, we resolve AABB's appeal as follows and
affirm.
1The Honorable Karen T. Nakasone presided.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
A proceeding involving the "forfeiture of a bond is a
civil proceeding."2  State v. Camara, 81 Hawai# i 324, 329 n.7,
916 P.2d 1225, 1230 n.7 (1996) (citation omitted).  As AABB seeks
the return of forfeited bail money, the applicable statute is
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 804-51 (2014).  Vaimili , 131
Hawai#i at 17, 313 P.3d at 706 ("HRS § 804–51 pertains to
recovery of a bail bond once the judgment of forfeiture has been
entered.").
HRS § 804-51 provides:
Whenever the court, in any criminal cause, forfeits
any bond or recognizance given in a criminal cause, the
court shall immediately enter up judgment in favor of the
State and against the principal or principals and surety or
sureties on the bond, jointly and severally, for the full
amount of the penalty thereof, and shall cause execution to
issue thereon immediately after the expiration of thirty
days from the date that notice is given via personal service
or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the surety
or sureties on the bond, of the entry of the judgment in
favor of the State, unless before the expiration of thirty
days from the date that notice is given to the surety or
sureties on the bond of the entry of the judgment in favor
of the State, a motion or application of the principal or
principals, surety or sureties, or any of them, showing good
cause why execution should not issue upon the judgment, is
filed with the court. If the motion or application, after a
hearing held thereon, is sustained, the court shall vacate
the judgment of forfeiture and, if the principal surrenders
or is surrendered pursuant to section 804-14 or section
804-41, return the bond or recognizance to the principal or
surety, whoever shall have given it, less the amount of any
cost, as established at the hearing, incurred by the State
as a result of the nonappearance of the principal or other
event on the basis of which the court forfeited the bond or
recognizance. If the motion or application, after a hearing
held thereon, is overruled, execution shall forthwith issue
and shall not be stayed unless the order overruling the
motion or application is appealed from as in the case of a
final judgment.
This section shall be considered to be set forth in
full in words and figures in, and to form a part of, and to
be included in, each and every bond or recognizance given in
a criminal cause, whether actually set forth in the bond or
recognizance, or not.
(Emphases added.)  
"[O]nce a bond is forfeited pursuant to HRS § 805-51, a
surety has thirty days from the time it receives notice of
forfeiture to set aside the forfeiture judgment[.]"  Vaimili , 131
2Although a civil proceeding, the Hawai #i Rules of Civil Procedure
(HRCP) do not apply.  HRCP Rule 81(a)(8).  AABB did not argue the
applicability of the HRCP before the Circuit Court, thereby waiving this
argument.  State v. Vaimili, 131 Hawai #i 9, 14 n.15, 313 P.3d 698, 703 n.15
(2013).
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Hawai#i at 15, 313 P.3d at 704.  "[N]othing in HRS § 804–51
permits the filing of a second judgment.  Instead, the initial
judgment becomes effective once the deadline to file a motion to
stay the execution of the judgment expires."  Id. at 18, 313 P.3d
at 707.  "HRS § 804–51 permits the filing neither of a second
motion seeking to show 'good cause why execution should not
issue' nor any motion after the closing of the thirty-day
[search] window.  The Surety's sole recourse from the 'appealable
event'. . . was by way of an appeal to this court."  State v.
Ranger Ins. Co., 83 Hawai #i 118, 124 n.5, 925 P.2d 288, 294 n.5
(1996).
In this case, AABB posted a bail bond in the amount of
$50,000.000 for Defendant Lyle Botelho (Botelho) on November 2,
2015.  On May 24, 2016, Botelho did not appear for sentencing and
the Circuit Court ordered the forfeiture of the bail bond and
issued a bench warrant for Botelho's arrest setting new bail in
the amount of $75,000.00.  A Judgment and Order of Forfeiture of
Bail Bond was entered on May 31, 2016.  A notice of the bail bond
forfeiture was mailed to AABB on May 31, 2016 and, on June 3,
2016, Arthur Lee appears to have signed the certified mail return
receipt for the Judgment and Order of Forfeiture of Bail Bond.  
Therefore, the search period, under HRS § 804-51, was from
June 3, 2016 to July 3, 2016.  On Tuesday, July 5, 2016, AABB
filed a Motion to Set Aside Bail Forfeiture Vacate Judgment and
Discharge Bond (hereafter "First Motion.")  On July 15, 2016, the
Honorable Jeffrey P. Crabtree entered an order denying the First
Motion.   AABB did not appeal from this order.
On February 16, 2017, Botelho was located, arrested on
the outstanding bench warrant, and surrendered.  On May l6, 2017,
AABB filed its Second Motion to Set Aside Bail Forfeiture
Reinstate Bond, then Discharge Bond (hereafter "Second Motion").  
The Circuit Court denied the Second Motion on June 22, 2017 for
lack of jurisdiction due to untimely filing
As the governing statute, HRS § 804-51 does not permit
a second motion to set aside a bail forfeiture, the Circuit Court
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
was correct in denying AABB's Second Motion.  Ranger Ins. Co. , 83
Hawai#i at 124 n.5, 925 P.2d 294 n.5. 
We therefore affirm the June 22, 2017 Order Denying
Above All Bail Bond's Second Motion to Set Aside Bail Forfeiture
Reinstate Bond Then Discharge Bond.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, April 13, 2018.
