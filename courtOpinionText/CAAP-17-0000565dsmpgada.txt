(By: Ginoza, C.J., Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of (1) Plaintiff/Counterclaim­
Defendant/Appellant/Cross-Appellee Association of Apartment
 Owners of Island Colony's (AOAO Island Colony) March 15, 2018
 notice of settlement of its claims against Defendant/
 Counterclaim-Plaintiff/Plaintiff/Appellee/Cross-Appellee Island
 Colony Partners (IC Partners) and Defendant/Counterclaim­Plaintiff/Appellee/Cross-Appellee American Pacific Hotels, LLC
 (American Pacific Hotels), (2) IC Partners and American Pacific
 Hotels' two April 12, 2018 motions to dismiss the appeal and
 cross-appeal in appellate court case number CAAP-17-0000565,
 (3) Defendants/Appellees/Cross-Appellants Shuto Sales & Mgmt., LLC, Hawaiian Paradise Retreats, LLC, and Suzanne Shuto's (the Shuto Cross-Appellants) April 19, 2018 memorandum in opposition to IC Partners and American Pacific Hotels' two April 12, 2018 motions, (4) AOAO Island Colony's May 8, 2018 "joinder" in IC Partners and American Pacific Hotels' two April 12, 2018 motions, and (5) the record, it appears that the voluntary dismissal of AOAO Island Colony's appeal is warranted under Rule 42(b) of the Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP), 
but the involuntary dismissal of the Shuto Cross-Appellants' cross-appeal is unwarranted in light of the Shuto Cross-Appellants' desire to proceed with appellate review of the 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Honorable Dean E. Ochiai's February 1, 2018 amended judgment in 
the consolidated cases of Civil No. 13-1-1847-07 and Civil No. 13-1-1961-07. 
AOAO Island Colony's appeal and the Shuto Cross-
Appellants' cross-appeal arise out of two civil circuit court
 cases in Civil No. 13-1-1847-07 and Civil No. 13-1-1961-07 that
 the circuit court consolidated under Civil No. 13-1-1847-07 on
 December 9, 2014, expressly "for all purposes" pursuant to HRCP
 Rule 42. The February 1, 2018 amended judgment enters judgment
 in favor of IC Partners and American Pacific Hotels and against
 AOAO Island Colony only as to all of AOAO Island Colony's claims
 in its complaint in the Civil No. 13-1-1847-07 portion of the
 consolidated case. Although the February 1, 2018 amended
 judgment does not resolve IC Partners' complaint against the
 Shuto Cross-Appellants in the Civil No. 13-1-1961-07 portion of
 the consolidated case, the circuit court includes an express
 finding of "no just reason for delay" in the entry of the
 February 1, 2018 amended judgment as to one or more but fewer
 than all claims or parties, as HRCP Rule 54(b) requires. The
 record shows that AOAO Island Colony timely asserted its appeal
 pursuant to HRAP Rule 4, and the Shuto Cross-Appellants timely
 asserted their cross-appeal pursuant to HRAP 4.1.
 
Two of the seven interlocutory orders that led to the
 
February 1, 2018 amended judgment are (1) a January 28, 2015
 partial summary judgment order and (2) a May 4, 2015 partial
 summary judgment order, both of which expressly direct that,
 "[b]ased on the representations of counsel for the Shuto Parties
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and counsel for Island Colony Partners in the Island Colony 
Partners v. Shuto Sales & Mgmt., LLC, et al. lawsuit, the parties therein have agreed to be bound by the decisions of this Court on this Motion for Summary Judgment." In other words, those particular rulings in the Civil No. 13-1-1847-07 portion of the consolidated cases are also expressly binding on the Shuto Cross-Appellants in the Civil No. 13-1-1961-07 portion of the consolidated cases. Consequently, the voluntary HRAP Rule 42(b) dismissal of AOAO Island Colony's appeal from the February 1, 2018 amended judgment does not render moot the Shuto Cross-Appellants' cross-appeal from the same February 1, 2018 amended judgment. HRAP Rule 4.1(d) provides that "[i]f the appellant abandons the initial appeal or the appellate court dismisses it, the cross-appeal may nevertheless be prosecuted to its conclusion, if allowed by law." The Shuto Cross-Appellants' cross-appeal from the February 1, 2018 amended judgment is authorized by HRS § 641-1(a). 
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that IC Partners and
 
American Pacific Hotels' two April 12, 2018 motions to dismiss
 the appeal and cross-appeal in appellate court case number 
CAAP-17-0000565 are granted in part and denied in part. We grant
 the two April 12, 2018 motions to dismiss to the limited extent
 that AOAO Island Colony asserted an appeal from the February 1,
 2018 amended judgment, and AOAO Island Colony now voluntarily
 agrees to the dismissal of its appeal pursuant to HRAP Rule
 42(b). We deny the two April 12, 2018 motions to dismiss to the 
-4­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
extent that the Shuto Cross-Appellants asserted a cross-appeal 
from the February 1, 2018 amended judgment, and the Shuto Cross-Appellants are entitled under HRAP Rule 4.1(d) to prosecute their cross-appeal to its conclusion.
