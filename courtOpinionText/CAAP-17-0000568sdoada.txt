SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.) 
In this consolidated appeal, Defendant-Respondent-
Appellant/Plaintiff-Appellant-Cross-Appellee Mary Ann McAndrew, 
individually and as the Trustee of the Mary Ann McAndrew Revocable Living Trust dated March 11, 2005 (McAndrew
), appeals 
from (1) the July 27, 2017 Final Judgment (Judgment Confirming 
Award) entered in Civil No. 14-1-1550, by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court),  in favor of Plaintiff-

With respect to the appeal from Civil No. 14-1-1550, 
McAndrew also challenges the Circuit Court's December 27, 2016 
order (O
rder Confirming Award), which confirmed an August 19, 
2016 arbitration award (Arbitration Award), as well as the 
Circuit Court's May 8, 2017 order, which awarded attorneys' fees

and costs to the AOAO and the Individual Defendants (Fees Order 
on Motion to Confirm). 
With respect to the appeal from Civil No. 16-1-1638, 
McAndrew also challenges the Circuit Court's December 28, 2016 
order, which entered summary judgment against McAndrew and dismissed her complaint seeking a trial de novo on her claims against the AOAO and the Individual Defendants (Dismissal Order). 
On cross-appeal from Civil No. 16-1-1638, the AOAO and the 
Individual Defendants challenge the Circuit Court's March 6, 2017 order, which denied their request for an award of attorneys' fees. (Fees Order re Dismissal). 
This case arises out of a dispute involving certain 
purportedly unauthorized renovations McAndrew made, or sought to make, to her unit in the Kuapa Isle Condominium Project (Kuapa 
Isle). The AOAO sued McAndrew in Civil No. 14-1-1550, seeking injunctive relief, attorneys' fees, and costs. The Circuit 
Court's minutes reflect that, at a January 9, 2015 hearing, the parties informed the court that they had agreed to transfer the matter to non-binding arbitration and were "still determining whether arbitration will be binding." On February 11, 2015, McAndrew filed a Demand for Arbitration against the AOAO and the Individual Defendants, with Dispute Prevention and Resolution, Inc. (DPR), seeking injunctive relief and damages for alleged 
wrongful conduct related to McAndrew's requests for approval of 
various repairs, renovations, and improvements to her unit at Kuapa Isle (Demand for Arbitration). On March 20, 2015, the AOAO 
and the Individual Defendants submitted an answer and the AOAO 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
  submitted a counterclaim to DPR; McAndrew answered the 
counterclaim. In August of 2015,3 all parties and DPR entered 
into an Agreement to Participate in Binding Arbitration (Binding 
Arbitration Agreement), which included in relevant part: 
By agreement of the parties set forth below, Dispute
Prevention & Resolution, Inc. (DPR)/Judge Marie Milks (Ret.)[(the Arbitrator  or Judge Milks )] have agreed to conduct a
binding arbitration proceeding of the matters in controversybetween them . Judge Milks has agreed to serve in the
capacity of a neutral and unbiased Arbitrator and willprovide arbitration services to the parties on an impartialbasis. The parties, DPR, and Judge Milks agree to followand abide by the DPR Arbitration Rules, Procedures &Protocols, as established by DPR, as well as HRS Chapters658A and 514B. It is understood and agreed that as aneutral, the Arbitrator will not act as an attorney oradvocate for any party. 
The Arbitrator shall determine all claims, defenses, and
issues submitted to arbitration by the parties via the: 1)Demand for Arbitration filed February 11, 2015 ("Demand");2) Respondents Association of Apartment Owners of KuapaIsle, Gerry Bogert, Garry (incorrectly named as Gary)Brechin, Jim Dittmar, Mark Elwell, Howard Tocman, and FredWong's Answer to Claimant Mary Ann McAndrew's Demand forArbitration Dated February 11, 2015; Counterclaim byAssociation of Apartment Owners of Kuapa Isle AgainstClaimant and Additional Counterclaim Defendants filed March 20, 2015 ("Association Answer/Counterclaim"); and 3)Claimant Mary Ann McAndrew, Individually and as the Trusteeof the Mary Ann McAndrew Revocable Living Trust Dated March11, 2005's Answer to Counterclaim by Association ofApartment Owners of Kuapa Isle Against Claimant andAdditional Counterclaim Defendants filed August 5, 2015("McAndrew Answer"), and may grant any and all remedies thatthe Arbitrator determines to be just and appropriate underthe law. 
This Agreement shall cover only the claims,
defenses, and issues set forth in the aforesaid Demand,Association Answer/Counterclaim, and McAndrew Answer.Should any party desire to amend the Demand, AssociationAnswer/Counterclaim, and/or McAndrew Answer to present newclaims, defenses, or issues, a separate Agreement toParticipate in Binding Arbitration must be signed by allparties before those additional claims, defenses, and/orissues shall be subject to binding arbitration. 
In the Award of the Arbitrator, the Arbitrator shall issue a
determination on the issue of all arbitration-related fees and costs, including the Arbitrator's compensation andexpenses and DPR's fees and expenses. In the Award of the Arbitrator, the Arbitrator shall also issue a determinationon the issue of an award or awards of attorneys' fees and

costs as provided by the Association's governing
instruments and applicable laws and/or statutes.
(Emphasis added).
The Arbitration Award was entered on August 19, 2016. 
The AOAO and the Individual Defendants filed a special
proceeding, S.P. No. 16-1-0326, in which they filed a motion to
confirm the Arbitration Award.  The AOAO also filed a motion to
confirm in Civil No. 14-1-1550, and the two cases were then
consolidated.  Although McAndrew opposed the motions to confirm,
she did not seek to vacate or modify the Arbitration Award. 
Instead, on August 26, 2016, in Civil No. 16-1-1638, McAndrew
filed a Complaint for Trial De Novo.  In Civil No. 14-1-1550
(consolidated), the Arbitration Award was confirmed.  In Civil
No. 16-1-1638, McAndrew's complaint was dismissed.  Notices of
appeal were timely filed.
McAndrew raises the following points of error on
appeal:  (1) in CAAP-17-0000568 (the appeal from Civil No. 16-1-
1638), McAndrew contends, on various grounds, that the Circuit
Court erred in dismissing the Complaint for Trial De Novo; (2)
also in CAAP-17-0000568, McAndrew contends that, because the
Circuit Court erred in entering the Order Granting Dismissal, the
Circuit Court erred in awarding costs and entering judgment
against her; (3) in CAAP-17-0000612, McAndrew contends, on
various grounds, that the Circuit Court erred in confirming the
Arbitration Award; (4) also in CAAP-17-0000612, McAndrew contends
that the Circuit Court erred in awarding attorneys' fees against
her; and (5) McAndrew contends that the Circuit Court erred in
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
confirming the Arbitration Award without giving her an 
opportunity for discovery and an evidentiary hearing. 
On cross-appeal in CAAP-17-0000568, the AOAO and the 
Individual Defendants raise the following points of error: (1) the Circuit Court erred in denying their request for attorneys' fees on the grounds that Civil No. 16-1-1638 was not an action in the nature of assumpsit; and (2) the Circuit Court erred in concluding that McAndrew's complaint was filed pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 514B-163 (2018), rather than pursuant to 
HRS § 658A-25 (2016), which arguably would have permitted an 
award of attorneys' fees against McAndrew. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve the parties' points of error as follows: McAndrew's Contentions 
(1) We first address McAndrew's arguments in CAAP-17-
0000568, challenging the Order of Dismissal entered in Civil No. 16-1-1638. McAndrew contends that the Circuit Court erred in entering the Order of Dismissal and denying her Complaint for Trial De Novo based on the Binding Arbitration Agreement because: (a) the Binding Arbitration Agreement states that arbitration was being conducted pursuant to HRS chapter 514B; (b) the denial of a trial de novo violated McAndrew's constitutional right to a trial by jury; (c)
 McAndrew did not waive her right to a jury trial; 
(d) McAndrew complied with the procedural requirements of HRS § 514B-163 and therefore is entitled to a trial de novo; 
(e) 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
McAndrew is not estopped by the Binding Arbitration Agreement 
from pursuing her right to trial; (f) because the Binding Arbitration Agreement states that the parties agree to "follow and abide by the DPR Arbitration Rules, Procedures & Protocols, as established by DPR, as well as HRS Chapters 658A and 514B" 
(emphasis added), the parties' submission to arbitration was 
pursuant to HRS § 514B-162 (2018) and McAndrew is entitled to a trial 
de novo pursuant to HRS § 514B-163(a); and (g) the Circuit 
Court improperly considered parol evidence of the parties' communications prior to the execution of the Binding Arbitration Agreement. 
McAndrew's arguments are fundamentally flawed. First, 
it is undisputed that McAndrew did not file a motion to vacate, modify, or correct the Arbitration Award under HRS § 658A-23 and/or § 658A-24 (2016). Thus, McAndrew has waived her right to challenge the confirmation order on any grounds allowed under HRS §§ 658A–23 and 658A–24. 
See Schmidt v. Pac. Benefit Servs., 
Inc., 113 Hawai# i 161, 168, 150 P.3d 810, 817 (2006); Mathewson 
v. Aloha Airlines, Inc., 82 Hawai# i
 57, 82, 919 P.2d 969, 994 
(1996); Excelsior Lodge No. One, Indep. Order of Odd Fellows v. Eyecor, Ltd., 74 Haw. 210, 222–26, 847 P.2d 652, 658–60 (1992); Arbitration of Bd. of Dirs. of Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Tropicana Manor, 73 Haw. 201, 213, 830 P.2d 503, 510 (1992) (AOAO 
Tropicana Manor). 
McAndrew argues that it was unnecessary to seek to 
vacate or modify the Arbitration Award because HRS § 514B-163 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
provides her with a right to a trial de novo .  This argument is
without merit.
HRS § 514B-163 provides:
§ 514B-163  Trial de novo and appeal.  (a) The
submission of any dispute to an arbitration under section
514B-162 shall in no way limit or abridge the right of any
party to a trial de novo.
(b)  Written demand for a trial de novo by any party
desiring a trial de novo shall be made upon the other
parties within ten days after service of the arbitration
award upon all parties and the trial de novo shall be filed
in circuit court within thirty days of the written demand. 
Failure to meet these deadlines shall preclude a party from
demanding a trial de novo.
(c)  The award of arbitration shall not be made known
to the trier of fact at a trial de novo.
(d)  In any trial de novo demanded under this section,
if the party demanding a trial de novo does not prevail at
trial, the party demanding the trial de novo shall be
charged with all reasonable costs, expenses and attorneys'
fees of the trial.  When there is more than one party on one
or both sides of an action, or more than one issue in
dispute, the court shall allocate its award of costs,
expenses, and attorneys' fees among the prevailing parties
and tax such fees against those nonprevailing parties who
demanded a trial de novo in accordance with the principles
of equity.
(Emphasis added). 
HRS § 514B-162 provides, in relevant part:
§ 514B-162  Arbitration.  (a) At the request of any
party, any dispute concerning or involving one or more unit
owners and an association, its board, managing agent, or one
or more other unit owners relating to the interpretation,
application, or enforcement of this chapter or the
association's declaration, bylaws, or house rules adopted in
accordance with its bylaws  shall be submitted to
arbitration . . . . 
(b) Nothing in subsection (a) shall be interpreted to
mandate the arbitration of any dispute involving:
. . . .
(4) Actions seeking equitable relief involving
threatened property damage or the health or
safety of unit owners or any other person; 
. . . .
(6) Personal injury claims; 
. . . .
(8)  Any other cases which are determined, as
provided in subsection (c), to be unsuitable for
disposition by arbitration.
 
(Emphasis added).  
8NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Thus, under this statutory scheme, with some 
exceptions, any party to a dispute involving a condominium unit 
owner and a condominium association can request the matter be submitted to arbitration pursuant to HRS § 514B-162, but HRS § 514B-163 provides that such submission pursuant to HRS § 514B-162 "shall in no way limit or abridge the right of any party to a trial de novo." However, neither statute precludes such parties from entering into an agreement to engage in binding arbitration.  The essential characteristic of binding 
arbitration is a waiver of a trial de novo. See, e.g., Kindred Nursing Ctrs., Ltd. P'ship v. Clark, 137 S. Ct. 1421, 1427 (2017) ("the primary characteristic of an arbitration agreement [is] a waiver of the right to go to court and receive a jury trial") (citations omitted). 
4
4 The legislative history of these statutory provisions, and their
HRS Chapter 514A predecessors, confirms that the Legislature desired to
mandate arbitration if any party requested it, but recognized the potentialconstitutional implications of an involuntary mandatory arbitration, and thus
provided for a trial de novo  of any such arbitration, rendering the mandatory
arbitration, in effect, non-binding. See 1984 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 107, § 1 at
199; H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 665-84, in 1984 House Journal, at 1176; S.
Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 241-84, in 1984 Senate Journal, at 1093 ("It is theintent of the bill, as amended, to expedite the disposition of certaindisputes and, at the same time, protect the constitutional right of any partyto due process and trial by a jury."); Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 70-84, in 1984House Journal, at 758, Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 68-84, in 1984 Senate Journal, at944, 945. The Chapter 514A arbitration provisions were subject to variousamendments between 1984 and 2004, when they were re-codified as the Chapter514B arbitration provisions. Specifically, these amendments: (1) clarifiedwhich actions for equitable relief are not subject to mandatory arbitration;(2) deleted the termination date for the arbitration provisions; (3) providedthe right to demand arbitration for certain unit owners disputing the validityof assessment liens; (4) modified "Horizontal Property Regime Rules" to"Condominium Property Regime Rules"; and (5) updated the prior references toChapter 658 in light of the adoption of the Uniform Arbitration Act as HRSChapter 658A. See 1985 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 53, § 1 at 84-85; 1987 Sess. LawsAct 124, §§ 1, 2 at 200-01; 1991 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 282, § 3 at 678-79; 1995Haw. Sess. Laws Act 11, § 19 at 16; 2001 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 265, §§ 3, 4 at820. The Chapter 514B arbitration provisions retained these amendments,
except that references related to the "Condominium Property Regime Rules" wereomitted. See HRS §§ 514B-162, 514B-163 (2006).

Here, six months after initially agreeing to enter into 
non-binding arbitration, with the question of binding arbitration 
to-be-determined, McAndrew entered into the "Agreement to Participate in Binding Arbitration." Contrary to McAndrew's assertion, it is the substance, not just the title, of the Binding Arbitration Agreement – "the parties . . . have agreed to conduct a binding arbitration proceeding of the matters in controversy between them" – that makes it clear that she agreed to be bound by the outcome.
5 We conclude that the plain language 
of the Binding Arbitration Agreement unambiguously expresses the parties' intent to conduct binding arbitration, notwithstanding that it includes an agreement to follow and abide by, inter alia, HRS Chapter 514B. Nothing in HRS Chapter 514B, including the above-referenced provisions, precludes parties from entering into a binding arbitration agreement. It is a fundamental principle that "[p]arties who willingly agree to submit [their] claims [to binding arbitration] and distill their accord into a written agreement 'thereby assume[] all the hazards of the arbitration process[.]'" Tatibouet v. Ellsworth, 99 Hawai# i 226, 236, 54 
P.3d 397, 407 (2002) (citation omitted). The most essential of those hazards is the relinquishment of the right to a trial 
de 
5 In addition to the above-quoted language, after identifying the
claims, defenses and issues to be submitted to arbitration, the Binding
Arbitration Agreement further states that if any new issues are to bepresented, "a separate Agreement to Participate in Binding Arbitration must besigned by all parties before those additional claims, defenses, and/or issuesshall be subject to binding arbitration." This additional language furtherrecognizes that the enumerated claims, defenses, and issues being submittedpursuant to the Binding Arbitration Agreement are subject to bindingarbitration.

novo. Accordingly, we conclude that the Circuit Court did not 
err in entering the Order of Dismissal.6 
(2) In CAAP-17-0000568, McAndrew also contends that 
the Circuit Court erred in awarding costs and entering judgment against her in Civil No. 16-1-1638. McAndrew's argument is simply that because the Circuit Court erred in entering the Order of Dismissal, it further erred in awarding costs and entering judgment against her. As we have concluded that the Circuit Court did not err in entering the Order of Dismissal, we further conclude that this argument has no merit. 
(3) & (5) In CAAP-17-0000612, McAndrew contends, on 
various grounds, that the Circuit Court erred in confirming the Arbitration Award. Relatedly, McAndrew contends that the Circuit Court erred in confirming the Arbitration Award without conducting an evidentiary hearing. We will address McAndrew's latter argument first. 
McAndrew argues that an award that has been "appealed" 
pursuant to HRS § 514B-163 cannot be confirmed without discovery and an evidentiary hearing, citing in the first instance AOAO Tropicana Manor, 73 Haw. at 213, 830 P.2d at 510, which simply states that "[b]y seeking clarification of the unambiguous original award instead of moving to vacate, modify, or correct 
6 McAndrew also asserts that the Circuit Court erred in considering
parol evidence with respect to the Binding Arbitration Agreement. However,
McAndrew fails to cite, and we cannot locate, where in the record the CircuitCourt purportedly relied on extrinsic evidence of the parties' communicationsin interpreting the language of the Binding Arbitration Agreement. In any
event, we conduct our review of the Binding Arbitration Agreement de novo  and 
conclude that it is an unambiguous agreement to conduct binding arbitration.
See Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Waikoloa Beach Villas v. Sunstone Waikoloa,LLC, 129 Hawai #i 117, 120, 295 P.3d 987, 990 (App. 2013), aff'd in part,
vacated in part, 130 Hawai #i 152, 307 P.3d 132. 
11 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the award pursuant to HRS §§ 658-9 and 658-10, or demanding a 
trial de novo pursuant to HRS § 514A-127 in a timely fashion, appellees waived their right to any judicial review of the award."
7 However, as discussed above, HRS § 514B-163, like its 
predecessor, HRS § 514A-127, provides for a trial de novo only when parties have completed a non-binding arbitration pursuant to HRS § 514B-162,
8 and not when the parties have entered into an 
agreement to engage in binding arbitration. Thus, AOAO Tropicana Manor does not support McAndrew's argument that she was entitled an evidentiary hearing in this case. 
McAndrew also argues that she is entitled to an 
evidentiary hearing on the issue of the arbitrator's alleged evident partiality, citing Nordic PCL Constr., Inc. v. LPIHGC, LLC, 136 Hawai# i 29, 358 P.3d 1 (2015). In Nordic, however – 
unlike in this case – the party challenging the arbitration award on the grounds of evident partiality filed a motion to vacate the arbitration award on that ground. Id. at 36, 358 P.3d at 8; see also Narayan v. Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Kapalua Bay Condo., 140 Hawai# i 75, 80, 398 P.3d 664, 669 (2017) (party alleging 
evident partiality moved to vacate arbitration award on that

Laws Act 164, §§ 2, 26 at 798-99, 813. In 2007, the Legislature amendedChapter 514A to again include HRS § 514A-127. 2007 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 244,§ 2 at 754. In 2017, Chapter 514A was repealed in its entirety, effectiveJanuary 1, 2019. 2017 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 181, §§ 2, 47 at 629, 659.

In 2017,Chapter 514A was repealed in its entirety, effective January 1, 2019. 2017 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 181, §§ 2, 47 at 629, 659.

ground); Noel Madamba Contracting LLC v. Romero, 137 Hawai# i 1, 
5, 364 P.3d 518, 522 (2015) (party alleging evident partiality, 
inter alia, moved to vacate arbitration award on that ground). We conclude that, having failed to file a motion to vacate the Arbitration Award in this case, McAndrew was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the issue of evident partiality. 
HRS § 658A-22 (2016) unambiguously provides that, upon 
a motion by a party to an arbitration, "the court shall issue a confirming order unless the award is modified or corrected pursuant to section 658A-20 or 658A-24 or is vacated pursuant to section 658A-23." 
(Emphasis added); see also Hawai# i Elec. Light 
Co. v. Tawhiri Power LLC, CAAP-11-0000163, 2014 WL 812938, *1 (Haw. App. Feb. 28, 2014) (SDO) ("[Appellee] waived its right to judicial review of the arbitration award by filing a Memo in Opposition to [Appellant]'s Motion to Confirm rather than moving to modify or correct the arbitration award pursuant to HRS § 658A-24 (Supp. 2013), or vacate the award pursuant to § 658A-23 (Supp. 2013)."); Blau v. AIG Haw. Ins. Co., CAAP-11-0000713, 2014 WL 2949437, *1 (Haw. App. June 30, 2014) (SDO). Here, McAndrew was not entitled to a trial 
de novo pursuant to HRS § 514B-163, 
and we conclude that she waived her right to challenge the Arbitration Award when she simply filed a memorandum in opposition to a motion to confirm, instead of moving to modify, correct, or vacate the award. 
(4) In her points of error in CAAP-17-0000612, 
McAndrew contends that the Circuit Court erred in entering the Fees Order on Motion to Confirm. However, in her "Legal 
13 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Argument," McAndrew argues that the Arbitrator improperly awarded 
attorneys' fees and makes no argument that the Circuit Court erred in awarding fees in its proceeding on the motion to confirm the Arbitration Award. As discussed above, McAndrew waived her right to challenge the Arbitration Award when she simply filed a memorandum in opposition to a motion to confirm, instead of moving to modify, correct, or vacate the award. As McAndrew failed to make any argument in support of her point of error challenging the Circuit Court's Fees Order on Motion to Confirm, we conclude that any such argument is waived. See
 
Hawai# i Rules 
of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(7). The Contentions of the AOAO and the Individual Defendants 
(1) The AOAO and the Individual Defendants contend 
that the Circuit Court erred when it concluded that McAndrew's Complaint for Trial De Novo was not an action in the nature of assumpsit and, on the basis, denied their request for attorneys' fees pursuant to HRS § 607-14 (2016). HRS § 607-14 provides, in relevant part: 
§ 607-14 Attorneys' fees in actions in the nature of
assumpsit, etc.  In all the courts, in all actions in the
nature of assumpsit and in all actions on a promissory note
or other contract in writing that provides for an attorney'sfee, there shall be taxed as attorneys' fees, to be paid bythe losing party and to be included in the sum for whichexecution may issue, a fee that the court determines to bereasonable[.]

contract, either express or implied, written or verbal, as well as quasi contractual obligations." Blair v. Ing, 96 Hawai# i 327,

 McAndrew's Complaint for Trial De Novo includes nine 
causes of action: (1) breach of contract; (2) breach of fiduciary 
and other duties; (3) breach of Restatement of Property, 3d §§ 6.13, 6.14; (4) breach of HRS §§ 514A and 514B; (5) breach of marks omitted). "[I]n ascertaining the nature of the proceeding 
on appeal, this court has looked to the essential character of the underlying action in the trial court." 
Leslie v. Estate of 
Tavares, 93 Hawai# i 1, 5, 994 P.2d 1047, 1051 (2000) (citation

Blair, 96 Hawai# i at 
332, 31 P.3d at 189 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). "[A]n equitable claim for relief is not in the nature of assumpsit." Leslie, 93 Hawai# i at 7, 994 P.2d at 1053; see 
also Lee v. Aiu, 85 Hawai# i 19, 31–32, 936 P.2d 655, 667–68 
(1997) (holding that a claim for specific enforcement of an agreement was not an action in the nature of assumpsit, even though the claimant prayed for damages as alternative relief). "Where there is doubt as to whether an action is in assumpsit or in tort, there is a presumption that the suit is in assumpsit." Blair, 96 Hawai# i at 332, 31 P.3d at 189 (citation and internal 
quotation marks omitted). Where a plaintiff "do[es] not complain of the kinds of economic losses that would result when the expectations of a party to a contract are frustrated," the action is not one in the nature of assumpsit, entitling a prevailing party to attorneys' fees pursuant to HRS § 607-14.

covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (6) 
negligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress; (7) selective enforcement of governing documents; (8) abuse of process; and (9) organized crime. With each of these claims, McAndrew broadly alleged that she suffered damages and, in her prayer for relief, McAndrew sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as general, special, and consequential damages. 
Looking at the facts and issues raised in McAndrew's 
complaint, the nature of the entire grievance, and the nature of the relief sought, McAndrew's claims were premised on allegations that, in unreasonably denying her requests to renovate her property, and by applying standards and restrictions on her that were not applied to other unit owners, as well as by filing suit against her, McAndrew suffered injuries in the nature of severe anxiety and emotional distress and incurred significant costs related to her re-submitted requests for renovations. Thus, although McAndrew did allege that her right to approval of reasonable requests for alterations and renovations stemmed from the House Rules, By-Laws, and Declaration governing Kuapa Isle, the injuries alleged were more closely akin to tort damages and the primary relief sought was a declaration that the denial of her renovations was unreasonable and that the AOAO and Individual Defendants should be enjoined from harassing her and should be ordered to allow her renovations to proceed. The complaint does not allege the kinds of economic losses that would result from a breach of contract. Thus, we conclude that the Circuit Court did not err or abuse its discretion in denying the AOAO and the 
16 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Individual Defendants' request for attorneys' fees under HRS 
§ 607-14. 
(2) The AOAO and the Individual Defendants also 
contend that the Circuit Court erred when it refused to award attorneys' fees pursuant to HRS § 658A-25, in the action on McAndrew's Complaint for a Trial De Novo. HRS § 658A-25 provides: 
§ 658A-25 Judgment on award; attorney's fees and
litigation expenses. (a) Upon granting an order confirming,
vacating without directing a rehearing, modifying, or
correcting an award, the court shall enter a judgment inconformity therewith. The judgment may be recorded,docketed, and enforced as any other judgment in a civilaction. 
(b) A court may allow reasonable costs of the motion
and subsequent judicial proceedings.
(c) On application of a prevailing party to a
contested judicial proceeding under section 658A-22, 658A-23, 658A-24, the court may add reasonable attorney's feesand other reasonable expenses of litigation incurred in ajudicial proceeding after the award is made to a judgmentconfirming, vacating without directing a rehearing,modifying, or correcting an award. 
(Emphasis added). 
In other words, where a party files a motion to confirm 
an arbitration award (HRS § 658A-22), a motion to vacate an 
arbitration award (HRS § 658A-23), or a motion to modify or correct an arbitration award (HRS § 658A-24), and the motion is contested, the court is permitted to add an award of attorneys' fees and costs to the judgment entered on the motion in favor of the prevailing party. As this court has recognized, HRS § 658A-25(c) "expressly limits the award of attorney's fees to a prevailing party to a contested judicial proceeding under [HRS §§] 658A-22, 658A-23, 658A-24[.]" In re Arbitration Between United Public Workers, AFSCME, Local 646, AFL-CIO and City and County of Honolulu, 119 
Hawai# i 201, 209, 210, 194 P.3d 1163, 
17 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
1171, 1172 (App. 2008) (citation and internal quotation marks 
omitted). 
We conclude the action initiated by McAndrew's 
Complaint for a Trial De Novo does not constitute a "contested judicial proceeding under section 658A-22, 658A-23, 658A-24." HRS § 658A-22(c). Accordingly, the Circuit Court did not err or abuse its discretion in the Fees Order re Dismissal by denying an award of attorneys' fees under HRS § 658A-25. 
For these reasons, we affirm the Circuit Court's July 
27, 2017 Judgment Confirming Award entered in Civil No. 14-1-1550 and July 14, 2017 Judgment Dismissing Complaint in Civil No. 16-1-1638.
