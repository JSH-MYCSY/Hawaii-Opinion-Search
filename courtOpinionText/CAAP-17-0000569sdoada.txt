The Circuit Court later amended Carter's sentences on
 
March 16, 2004, in its Second Amended Judgment Guilty Conviction
 
and Sentence (Second Amended Judgment), but the extended terms at
 
issue were left unaltered.3
 
On September 2, 2016, Carter filed his petition for 
post-conviction relief pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of Penal 
Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40 (Rule 40 Petition). The Circuit Court held a hearing regarding the Rule 40 Petition on May 16, 2017, 
and then entered its Order Denying Petition on June 27, 2017. In its Order Denying Petition, the Circuit Court made the following conclusions of law which are relevant to this appeal. 
D.	 Therefore, under the above case law, this Court
concludes:
 
1)	 The Maugaotega case rejects the Petitioner's
assertion that when he was sentenced in 2000,
the Sentencing Court erred in granting the
State's Motion for Extended Term of
 Imprisonment, by not providing him with a jury
determination on the motion. Petitioner was not
 entitled to such relief because Maugaotega only
applied prospectively after 2007.
 
2)	 Furthermore, because Petitioner's sentence
became final in 2003, four years before
Maugaotega was decided, the Mara case confirms
that Petitioner could not collaterally attack
his extended prison term based on Apprendi. 
On appeal, Carter contends that the Circuit Court erred
 
in denying his Rule 40 Petition because Conclusions of Law (COLs)
 
D.1) and D.2) were erroneous.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Benitez's point of error as follows:

Based on the Hawai' i Supreme Court's opinion in 
Flubacher v. State, 142 Hawai' i 109, 414 P.3d 161 (2018), we 
agree. In Flubacher, the State conceded, and the supreme court 
concluded, that "any extended term sentence imposed after June 
26, 2000, in which the court, not a jury, found the fact of 'necessary for protection of the public' is in violation of 
Apprendi." Flubacher, 142 Hawai' i at 114, 414 P.3d at 166 
(emphasis added). 
Here, Carter's extended term sentences were imposed on
 
August 28, 2000, approximately two months after Apprendi. 
Moreover, a judge, not a jury, made the required findings that an
 extended term was necessary for protection of the public. 
Although his sentences were amended on March 16, 2004, in other
 aspects, the extended terms were left unaltered. 
Accordingly, COL D.1), which asserted that Carter was
 
not "entitled to [a jury determination]" on the motion, was
 
erroneous. Furthermore, COL D.2), which determined that Carter
 
"could not collaterally attack his extended prison term based on
 Apprendi," was also wrong. 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's June 27, 2017
 
Order Denying Petition and the portions of the March 16, 2004
 Second Amended Judgment imposing extended term sentences are

vacated, and this case is remanded for further proceedings
 
consistent with Flubacher.
