APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 16-1-153K)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
Upon review of the record, it appears that:
(1) On July 27, 2017, Defendants-Appellants Zachary J.
Williams and Annalene Kotz Williams (Appellants), pro se, filed a
civil appeals docketing statement but did not file a notice of NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
appeal.  Nonetheless, the appeal proceeded as if Appellants had
filed a notice of appeal;1
(2) On September 25, 2017, the circuit court clerk
filed the record on appeal, and the appellate clerk notified the
parties that the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief were
due on or before October 5, 2017, and November 6, 2017,
respectively.  It is not clear whether the appellate clerk mailed
the notice of entering case on calendar to Appellants, who are
not registered Judiciary Electronic Filing System Users;
(3) Appellants did not file the statement of
jurisdiction or opening brief, or request an extension of time;
(4) On December 13, 2017, the appellate clerk notified
Appellants that the time for filing the statement of jurisdiction
and opening brief had expired, the matter would be called to the
court's attention on December 26, 2017, for appropriate action,
which could include dismissal of the appeal, pursuant to Hawai# i
Rules of Appellate Procedure Rules 12.1(e) and 30, and any
request for relief from default should be made by motion.  The
appellate clerk mailed the default notice to Appellants, and no
return mail was received; and
(5) Appellants took no further action in this appeal.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is
dismissed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, March 6, 2018.
