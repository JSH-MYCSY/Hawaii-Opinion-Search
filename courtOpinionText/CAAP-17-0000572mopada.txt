On appeal, BWC raises three points of error (POEs) 
contending that the Circuit Court erred by: (1) "entering 
judgment in favor of the Trust because the record does not support its determination that BWC breached the lease or that BWC was unjustly enriched, neither the Second Amended Complaint nor the evidence support the [Circuit Court]'s tenancy at sufferance decision, and there was no relevant or reliable evidence to support the [Circuit Court]'s erroneous market rental damage award," and challenging FOFs 12-16, 18-27, 29-42, 44-135, and COLs 1-56; (2) "holding Robinson and Patterson jointly and severally liable and in refusing to apply the time is of the essence provision of the Option to the entire option/purchase procedure," and challenging FOFs 9-10, 22-24, and COLs 1-32; and (3) abusing its discretion in awarding the Trust attorneys' fees, certain expert witness fees, and deposition costs that are "not permitted under Hawaii law and not reasonable[.]"

We hold that the Circuit Court did not err in entering 
judgment in favor of the Trust based on its determination that BWC breached the Lease, did not err in finding Robinson and Patterson jointly and severally liable, and did not abuse its

discretion in the award of attorneys' fees and costs. We thus

I. BACKGROUND 
This lengthy dispute concerns a lease of premises 
consisting of several adjacent parcels, which included a warehouse style building, a commercial laundry operation, and offices for support staff located at 865 Kinoole Street (Premises
) in Hilo, Hawai# i. 
On June 1, 1994, Edward F. Foley (Foley
), as 
predecessor trustee of the Trust, and Michael Gorelangton (Gorelangton) and Patricia Gorelangton, on behalf of SWL, Inc., 
entered into a 25-year lease agreement (Lease) for the Premises. 
The Lease included an option to purchase the Premises (Option), 
which could be exercised during a specified time frame between 
May 20, 2009 to June 10, 2009; however, the Option contained no specified purchase price.  In 1997, SWL, Inc. assigned its 
4
4 In summary, the Option required that within ten days of
exercising the Option, the parties were required to submit escrow instructions
to consummate the sale and close the sale by July 1, 2009. However, if theparties failed to agree upon a purchase price, then the parties were requiredto go through an appraisal process pursuant to subsection (f). Subsection (f)required that each party "appoint a duly licensed (Hawaii) real estateappraiser" and the chosen appraisers "appoint a third all of whom willappraise the fair market value of the Premises." The average of the twoappraised values which were the closest would then be the purchase price.The relevant Option terms were as follows: 
(a) Lessor does hereby grant to Lessee an option to
purchase the Premises and the Lessor's interest under thisLease, upon the terms and conditions herein set forth. 
(b) Lessee must exercise the option to purchase, if it is
to be exercised at all, during the period from May 20, 2009
to June 10, 2009, hereinafter referred to as the "OptionPeriod". 
(c) In order to exercise the option to purchase herein
granted, Lessee must give written notice of the exercise of
the option to Lessor and Lessor must receive the same duringthe Option Period, time being of the essence, and if not sogiven and received, this option shall automatically expire.At the same time the option is exercise [sic], Lessee mustdeliver to Lessor a cashier's check for $100,000, payable toFoley Family Trust, to be part of the purchase price. 
(d) The provisions of paragraph 39, including the provision
relating to default of Lessee set forth in paragraph 39.4 of
(continued...) 
3 4(...continued)NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
interest in the Lease and the Option to BWC (Assignment).   
Concurrently with the Assignment, Robinson and Patterson, who 
were members of BWC, signed a Guaranty of Lease and Indebtedness (Guaranty), guaranteeing all payments due from BWC to the Trust 
under the terms of the Lease and the Option.
Exercise of the Option, appointment of appraisers 
On June 8, 2009, pursuant to the Option, BWC timely 
exercised its right to purchase the Premises and paid $100,000 to 
the Trust.  BWC provided an appraisal report by Glenn Kunihisa 
(Kunihisa); however, the Trust noted that the appraisal was done 
for the "purposes of obtaining federally-related mortgage 
financing" and not "intended for any other use."  BWC then 
retained Kunihisa to do the appraisal for the Option and 
this Lease are conditions of the Option; 
(e) If Lessee shall exercise the option to purchase during
the Option Period, the transfer of title to Lessee and the
payment of the purchase price to Lessor shall occur on July1, 2009, and until that time the terms of this Lease shallremain in full force and effect. 
(f) The purchase price to be paid by Lessee to Lessor for
the Premises . . . shall be all cash. 
If Lessor and Lessee 
are unable to agree on a price, then Lessor and Lessee shall
each appoint a duly licensed (Hawaii) real estate appraiserand these two shall appoint a third all of whom willappraise the fair market value of the Premises. The averageof the two appraised values which are closest shall be thepurchase price. 
(g) Within ten (10) days of the date the option to purchase
is exercised, Lessor and Lessee shall give instructions to
consummate the sale to First American Title Insurance Company, who shall act as escrow holder, on the normal andusual escrow forms then used by such escrow holder, asfollows: 
(i) Escrow shall close on the date previously called
for in paragraph (e) of this Addendum; 
(ii) Lessor shall deposit the check referred to in
paragraph (c) of this Addendum into escrow upon
opening thereof . . . 
. . . . 
(v) Interest, if any, and rents will be prorated to
the close of escrow . . . .

 submitted another appraisal report of the Premises on July 15, 
2009. The parties were unable to agree on a purchase price, and commenced the appraisal process under the Option. 
The Trust retained Jan Medusky (Medusky) as their 
appraiser.  In order to obtain an accurate appraisal of the 
Premises, Medusky needed to retain a cost estimator for the 
specialized improvements on the Premises and wanted access to the interior of the Premises. BWC initially refused to provide 
Medusky and the cost estimator access to the Premises and 
demanded as a precondition that escrow be opened and the monies deposited. BWC eventually accommodated Medusky and the estimator for a viewing of the Premises, and Medusky submitted his report 
on January 18, 2010.
Appointment of third appraiser After the appraisals were completed by each side's 
appraiser, BWC and the Trust disagreed over escrow instructions 
and the process of appointing the third appraiser. Eventually 
the dispute was submitted to the Circuit Court for resolution, at 
which time the parties agreed that the third appraiser would be selected by Medusky and Kunihisa, and that information to the third appraiser would be limited to "necessary information to conduct an appraisal in conformance with usual and standard appraisal practices." After the initial third appraiser was 
appointed, BWC accused this appraiser of being "tainted" by 
Kunihisa and Medusky with improper information. Because of the 
allegations, Kunihisa refused to participate further and resigned 
on June 9, 2011. 
BWC refused to reappoint another appraiser and the 
parties had additional disagreements about the process. 
Eventually, on June 29, 2011, BWC appointed Steven Chee (Chee) as 
their new appraiser. Chee and Medusky agreed on the third 
appraiser, Paul Cool (Cool). BWC again claimed that Cool was 
"tainted" by Medusky because of improper ex parte communications. 
BWC filed a motion to disqualify Cool, which was denied, and Cool 
submitted his appraisal report on January 23, 2013. 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
  
 
  
 After the appraisals were completed, BWC had trouble 
obtaining financing secured by the Premises. On April 27, 2015, 
nearly six years after the exercise of the Option, BWC purchased 
the Premises for $1,539,000.00.  From July 1, 2009 until the 
April 27, 2015 closing, BWC had remained in possession of the 
Premises and paid no rent to the Trust.
Action filed to collect rent from July 1, 2009 
On July 8, 2010, the Trust filed a complaint against 
BWC seeking to recover unpaid rents from July 1, 2009 until the 
2015 closing, alleging that the Lease was still in effect until escrow closed. On September 20, 2010, BWC filed its answer and a 
counterclaim, alleging that the Trust was responsible for 
delaying the closing, breaching the contract, along with other counterclaims. The Trust filed an amended complaint alleging, inter alia, that it was excused from performing its obligations under the Option, and adding Robinson and Patterson as defendants. 
2016 Trial 
Following a bench trial in May and June of 2016, the 
Circuit Court entered its FOFs/COLs finding, inter alia, that BWC 
breached the Lease when it withheld rent because the Lease did not terminate on July 1, 2009 upon the exercise of the Option, and that any representations by Foley to BWC were made on the basis that escrow would close and title transferred. The Circuit Court concluded that if the parties failed to agree on a purchase price, the July 1, 2009 closing date was unreasonable pursuant to the appraisal process in subsection (f) of the Option, and that the parties did not assume what would occur if the parties failed to agree on a purchase price by July 1, 2009. Further, the Circuit Court concluded that BWC breached the covenants of good faith and fair dealing relating to the Option when it interfered with the appraisal process on or around June 9, 2011, when Kunihisa withdrew as BWC's appraiser and BWC refused to reappoint a new appraiser.  Additionally, the Circuit Court found that BWC 
caused delays by attempting to control the appraisal process such 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 
  
  
  as by consistently requesting to pick the third appraiser, 
alleging the third appraisers were "tainted," and refusing access to the Premises for the Trust to complete its appraisal.
Fees and Costs 
On February 22, 2017, the Trust filed Plaintiffs' 
Request for Taxation of Costs by the Clerk of the Court Against 
Defendants BWC Hawaii, LLC, Robinson and Patterson, Jointly and Severally (Request for Taxation of Costs), which the Clerk 
granted in the amount of $24,339.14.  On March 3, 2017, BWC filed 
their Motion for Review.  On March 8, 2017, the Trust also filed 
their Motion for Attorney's Fees. 
On April 5, 2017, a hearing on the Motion for Review 
and Motion for Attorney's Fees was held. At the hearing, the Circuit Court awarded $9,540.74 in costs to reflect the removal 
of expert witness fees. On June 14, 2017, the Circuit Court 
filed its Order Granting Attorney's Fees in the amount of 
$230,082.71, finding that the fees awarded were reasonable under the Lease. 
On July 19, 2017, the Circuit Court entered Final 
Judgment in favor of the Trust for $1,013,385.17. This timely 
appeal followed. 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A. FOFs/COLs 
"[A] trial court's FOFs are subject to the clearly 
erroneous standard of review. An FOF is clearly erroneous when, 
despite evidence to support the finding, the appellate court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed." Chun v. Bd. of Trs. of the Emps.' Ret. Sys. of 
the State of Haw., 106 Hawai# i 416, 430, 106 P.3d 339, 353 (2005) 
(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). 
"An FOF is 
also clearly erroneous when the record lacks substantial evidence to support the finding. [The Hawai# i Supreme Court has] defined 
'substantial evidence' as credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion." Leslie v. Est. of

  Tavares, 91 Hawai# i 394, 399, 984 P.2d 1220, 1225 (1999) 
(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). 
A COL is not binding upon an appellate court and is freely
reviewable for its correctness. [The appellate court]ordinarily reviews COLs under the right/wrong standard.Thus, a COL that is supported by the trial court's FOFs andthat reflects an application of the correct rule of law willnot be overturned. However, a COL that presents mixedquestions of fact and law is reviewed under the clearlyerroneous standard because the court's conclusions are dependent upon the facts and circumstances of eachindividual case. 
Chun, 106 Hawai# i at 430, 106 P.3d at 353 (citations and internal 
brackets omitted) (quoting Allstate Ins. Co. v. Ponce, 105 
Hawai# i 445, 453, 99 P.3d 96, 104 (2004)).
B. Taxation of Costs 
The award of a taxable cost is within the discretion of the 
circuit court and will not be disturbed absent a clear abuse of discretion. An abuse of discretion occurs when the circuit court has clearly exceeded the bounds of reason ordisregarded rules or principles of law or practice to thesubstantial detriment of a party litigant. 
Pulawa v. GTE Hawaiian Tel, 112 Hawai# i 3, 10-11, 143 P.3d 1205, 
1212-13 (2006) (citations, brackets, and internal quotation marks 
omitted).
C. Attorneys' Fees 
The trial court's grant or denial of attorney's fees and
costs is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard. The trial court abuses its discretion if it bases its rulingon an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneousassessment of the evidence. In other words, an abuse ofdiscretion occurs where the trial court has clearly exceededthe bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles oflaw or practice to the substantial detriment of a partylitigant.

III. DISCUSSION 
A. POE 1: Breach of the Lease 
BWC contends that the Circuit Court erred in entering 
judgment in favor of the Trust because the record does not 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
  
  
 support its determination that BWC breached the Lease.  BWC 
argues that if BWC is found not liable on the basis of breach of 
contract, the Circuit Court also erred in holding that BWC was liable to the Trust under the alternative theories of doctrine of tenancy at sufferance and unjust enrichment, and that the award of market rental damages under these alternative theories were based on unreliable and irrelevant testimony. We address the 
arguments based on breach of the Lease as that issue is 
dispositive, and we do not reach BWC's alternative arguments in this POE. 
The Circuit Court's mixed finding and conclusion, that
the Lease did not terminate until escrow closed, wasnot clearly erroneous. 
BWC argues that upon the exercise of the Option, the 
Lease terminated on July 1, 2009, and that Foley made 
representations that upon the timely exercise of the Option, no further rent would be sought after July 1, 2009. BWC points to 
the specific July 1, 2009 closing date and Gorelangton's 
testimony that at the time of negotiating the Option, Gorelangton believed that "even if there was a delay in the closing, . . . the lease would terminate as of July 1, 2009."  BWC also points 
to the testimonies of its previous attorney, Robinson, and 
Patterson, in arguing that Foley made representations that no rent would be sought after July 1, 2009, and the $100,000 would be placed in an escrow account and applied to the purchase price. 
The Circuit Court found in FOFs 26, 30, and 31: 
26. When Gorelangton negotiated the terms of the Option, it
never occurred to him that the purchase price might not bedetermined by July 1 , 2009. [Gorelangton trial testimony,
50:12-18] 
. . . . 
30.
 Although BWC claims that the rents payable on the lease
would have terminated on July 2009, there are no explicitprovisions in the option supporting this position. Anystatements that may have been made by Foley that rents wouldhave ended on July 1, 2009 are consistent with a sale thatwould have closed on July 1, 2009, because at such time, BWCwould be both the holder of the fee simple interest in thePremises and the lessee. In such a circumstance after BWC's purchase of the Premises, it would be up to BWC as to how to 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
treat the lease and to forgo any rents or to cancel the
lease. 
31. The court finds that if there were any representations
by Foley made to the effect that lease rents would beterminated upon the exercise of the option, it can only beconstrued to have meaning within the context of completingthe sale under the option. 
In COLs 9, 10, and 16, which present mixed questions of fact and 
law, the Circuit Court concluded: 
9. The Option did not affect the lease except for the
occurrence of the sale of the premise [sic] to the lessee.In particular, if the option was not exercised it is obviousthat the lease would continue to run until the term specified in the lease unless there was some other reasonfor an earlier termination. It is not logical that if therewere an attempted but ineffective attempt to exercise theoption, or a successful exercise but an unsuccessfulexecution of the terms of the option to sale, that the termsof the lease would be terminated. 
10. There was no agreement in the Lease or the Option,
express or implied that the obligation of the tenant to payrent would terminate on the exercise of the Option by theleases. 
. . . . 
16.
 The interpretation of paragraph "(e)" of the Option that
most reasonably reflects the intention of the parties asmanifested by the Option in its entirety is that the termsof the Lease until the close of the sale of the Premises if not on July 1, 2009, then within a reasonable time toaccomplish the sale. The lease terms and the obligationscontinued to apply through the date that title wastransferred and the purchase price was paid, namely, April27, 2015. 
In Porter v. Hu, 116 Hawai# i 42, 59-60, 169 P.3d 994, 
1011-12 (App. 2007) (quoting State v. Eastman, 81 Hawai# i 131, 
139, 913 P.2d 57, 65 (1996)), this court stated: 
It is for the trial judge as fact-finder to assess thecredibility of witnesses and to resolve all questions offact; the judge may accept or reject any witness's testimonyin whole or in part . . . . An appellate court will not passupon the trial judge's decisions with respect to thecredibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence,because this is the province of the trial judge. 
BWC's arguments are based on its contrary view of the evidence, 
relying on its own witnesses, and are unavailing. See id. It 
was properly within the Circuit Court's province to weigh the evidence and consider the witnesses' testimonies in determining 
10 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
  
 that the Lease did not terminate on July 1, 2009 upon the 
exercise of the Option; that this interpretation reasonably reflected the intent of the parties; and that any representations made by Foley were made on that basis. BWC offers no argument why the FOFs and COLs set forth supra are clearly erroneous. See 
HRAP Rule 28(b)(7); Chun, 106 Hawai# i at 430, 106 P.3d at 353. 
BWC fails to demonstrate error. See HRAP Rule 28(b)(7); Haw. 
Ventures, LLC v. Otaka, Inc., 114 Hawai# i 438, 480, 164 P.3d 696, 
738 (2007) (finding that the appellants failed to demonstrate error because they "do not point to anything in the record or provide any analysis that would guide th[e] court in determining the validity of their contention"). We conclude there is substantial evidence to support the Circuit Court's determination that the lease terms and obligations continued to apply through the date title transferred and the purchase price was paid on April 27, 2015.
The Circuit Court's findings that BWC, not the Trust,
caused the delays, were not clearly erroneous. 
BWC argues that the record established that as of July 
1, 2009, BWC was willing and ready to close escrow; however, the 
Trust caused unilateral delays by refusing to abide by the "time is of the essence" clause and failing to open an escrow account. 
BWC points to various emails to the Trust's attorney and 
Robinson's testimony, to argue that BWC consistently asked the Trust to open an escrow account, to deposit the $100,000 into the account, and to follow the terms of the Option. 
BWC also refers 
to Robinson's testimony that BWC was willing to purchase the Premises, but the Trust repeatedly failed to agree to a purchase price and had no sense of "urgency." 
The Circuit Court found in FOFs 56 and 57, that the 
Option "places no time limit" on when an agreement on the purchase price must be reached, and that as of July 1, 2009, the parties were "still trying to reach [an] agreement[.]" The Circuit Court found that the appraisal process in subsection (f) of the Lease was "triggered" because of the lack of agreement on 
11 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 a purchase price, and that BWC caused the delays in the appraisal 
process, as follows: 
66. On July 3, 2009, Watts [(the Trust's former attorney)]
sought permission for Medusky to inspect the Premises onJuly 7, 2009. Fasi [(BWC's former attorney)] responded thatJuly 7th was not a good day for the inspection. [Exhibit P-33] 
67. Because Medusky was going to the Big Island on another
job on July 7th, he stopped by the Premises on that date butwas denied permission to inspect the interior. 
. . . . 
70.
 On September 8, 2009, Watts informed Fasi  that a 
decision had been made to hire a building consultant andthat both Medusky and the building consultant would needaccess to the interior of the building. [Exhibit P-39] Fasiresponded with a message stating that, "Before yourconsultant is allowed onto the property, my client demandsthat the escrow be opened and the deposit monies depositedinto same and that a third appraiser be chosen or at leastthe process of selecting the third appraiser is begun by Mr. 
Medusky providing some names to me to select from." [ExhibitP-40] 
. . . . 
75. Although both Foley and BWC prepared and attempted toagree on escrow instructions, so that escrow could beopened, they were unsuccessful in reaching agreement untilthey signed the Commercial Escrow Instructions dated January23, 2015. 
. . . . 
95.
 BWC attempted to control the process for determination
of the purchase price, and, as a result, the determinationof the purchase price was delayed. 
. . . . 
97.
 Initially, BWC took the position that the parties could
provide the third appraiser with information relative to thevalue of the Premises. This early position of BWC is shownin the form of escrow instructions that BWC proposed on July10, 2009, . . . . 
98. However, after Medusky published his appraisal report on
January 18, 2010, BWC took the position that the parties
could convey no information concerning their opinion ofthe value of the Premises to the third appraiser. Thischange in position was first stated by BWC in the escrowinstructions that Fasi sent to Watts on May 6, 2010.[Exhibit P-58] 
99. Because of BWC's change in position, Foley and BWC were
unable to agree on a procedure for selecting the thirdappraiser. 
12 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
. . . . 
 102.
 After the court's decision, Kunihisa and Medusky
conferred and tentatively appointed appraiser James
Hallstrom as the third appraiser. However, BWC becameconcerned that [the initial third appraiser] may have beenprovided with improper information and, acting through Fasi,instructed Kunihisa to withdraw his appointment. [KunihisaDeposition Transcript 19:21-21 :12; 26:7-14; 28:13-20] 
103. Kunihisa became upset with BWC's attempt to interfere
in the process of selecting a third appraiser and on June 9,2011, "resigned" from the selection process. [KunihisaDeposition Transcript 28:21-29:19; 41:24-43:15] 
104. Following Kunihisa's resignation, Foley demanded that
BWC appoint a new appraiser and that the new appraiserperform his own appraisal, as required by the Option.[Exhibit P-66] 
105. Initially, BWC refused to appoint a new appraiser and
took the position that it could continue to use the Kunihisaappraisal and could select the third appraiser itself.[Exhibit P-67] Watts responded that Foley would not agreeto amend the Option to allow BWC to select the thirdappraiser. [Exhibit P-68] 
The Circuit Court concluded in COL 55, a mixed finding and 
conclusion, that: 
55. For the period between June 8, 2009 when the Option was
exercised to June 9, 2011, BWC has failed to prove, by thepreponderance of the evidence, that Foley or Plaintiffs havebreached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealingby proof that conduct of a party (the Trust/lessor)constituted evasion of the spirit of the bargain, lack ofdiligence and slacking off, willful rendering of imperfectperformance, abuse of a power as to specific terms, [or]interference with or failure to cooperate in the otherparty's performance, the conduct is not actionable unless itresults in monetary damage to the party claiming the breach.Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 205 cmt. d (1979);[Kuroda v. SPJS Holdings, LLC], 971 A. 2d 872, 888 (Del. Ch.2009); [Francis v. Lee Enterprises], 89 Haw. 234, 971 P. 2d707 (1999). To the contrary, the court finds that the
delays in the closing of the sale which may have resulted inthe payments of rents that could have been avoided by anearlier sale resulted from the conduct of BWC as specifiedabove. 
(Emphasis added). 
The Circuit Court as fact-finder found that BWC was 
responsible for causing delays in the process. COL 55. See 
Porter, 116 Hawai# i at 59-60, 169 P.3d at 1011-12. BWC's 
argument relies on its contrary view of the evidence based on its 
own witnesses, and is unavailing. See id. BWC offers no

argument why these FOFs and mixed FOF and COL above are clearly 
erroneous based on a lack of substantial evidence. See Chun, 
106 Hawai# i at 430, 106 P.3d at 353. BWC fails to demonstrate 
error. See HRAP Rule 28(b)(7); Haw. Ventures, LLC, 114 Hawai# i 
at 480, 164 P.3d at 738. 
The Circuit Court's finding, that the "time being of
the essence" provision in subsection (c) of the Optionrefers only to the exercise of the Option, was notclearly erroneous. 
BWC argues that the "time being of the essence" 
provision in subsection (c) applied to  
 the entire Option, 
including the appraisal process.   BWC relies on the testimonies 
of its own witnesses — — Gorelangton, Robinson, and Patterson 
— — to argue that the "time being of the essence" provision applied to the entire Option including the appraisal process, and that this reading reasonably reflected the intent of the parties. 5
The Circuit Court found in FOFs 22-25 that "time being 
of the essence" applied only to the Option: 
22. The court construed the "time being of the essence"
language in Paragraph (c) of the option to refer only to theexercise of the option. It is clear from the manner in whichthe phrase is employed in the first sentence in Paragraph(c) that it is only to be applied as to the matter andtiming of the exercise of the option by the lessee. The"time being of the essence" provision in Paragraph (c), doesnot apply generally to the other terms and provisions of theOption[.] 
23. The longest time between the earliest date the Option
could be exercised and the sale closing date of July 1,2009, is about 41 days (May 20, 2009 to July 1, 2009). Theshortest time between the latest date the Option could beexercised and the sale closing date is about 21 days (June10, 2009 to July 1, 2009). 
24. It was the intention of the parties to close the sale as
quickly as practicable once the option was exercised. If theparties had agreed on a price at or about the time theoption was exercised, the stated closing of July 1, 2009 wasreasonable[.] 
25. Upon the failure of the parties to reach an agreement as
to price, however, the option called for a process ofappraisals and under those circumstances the closing date ofJuly 1, 2009 was not reasonable, as borne out by: (1) what 
5 This argument was raised in connection with POE 2, but we address
it in our discussion here of POE 1. 
14   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
transpired in fact after this process was resorted to by the
parties, (2) given that the appraisal process called for theselection of an appraiser by each of the parties and thatthe two selected appraisers then selecting a thirdappraiser, and (3) as borne out by the appraisals submittedby the parties in evidence, the fact that the appraisalconcerned a commercial /industrial property, and other unique
aspects of the Premises including its location, and thescarcity of a comparable fee simple properties in the Hiloarea . 
The Circuit Court as the fact-finder weighed all 
witnesses' testimonies and found that the "time being of the 
essence" provision only applied to the exercise of the Option. See Porter, 116 Hawai# i at 59-60, 169 P.3d at 1011-12. BWC's 
argument based on its contrary view of the evidence is unavailing. See id. BWC offers no argument why the above FOFs 
are clearly erroneous based on a lack of substantial evidence. See Chun, 106 Hawai# i at 430, 106 P.3d at 353. BWC fails to 
demonstrate error. See HRAP Rule 28(b)(7); Haw. Ventures, LLC, 
114 Hawai# i at 480, 164 P.3d at 738. 
B. POE 2: Joint and several liability 
BWC argues that the Circuit Court erred in holding 
Robinson and Patterson jointly and severally liable because Foley induced them to sign the Guaranty through material representations that the Lease would terminate on July 1, 2009 upon exercise of the Option. BWC contends that "[t]he decision 
whether to hold a party jointly and severally liable is decided 
on a case-by-case basis, depending on whether it is appropriate under the circumstances," citing Smith v. Cutter Biological, Inc., a Div. of Miles Inc., 72 Haw. 416, 431, 823 P.2d 717, 725 (1991). BWC argues that it was not "appropriate" to hold Robinson and Patterson jointly and severally liable where they were induced by Foley's representations that no rent would be sought after July 1, 2009. 
The Circuit Court found in FOFs 10
6 and 31 (quoted 
supra) that Robinson and Patterson signed the Guaranty, which 
6 FOF 10 stated: "On October 9, 1997, Robinson and Patterson signed
personal guarantees pursuant to which they guaranteed all payments due from
BWC to the Trust and under the terms of the Lease and Option. . . ." 
15 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 guaranteed all payments due from BWC to the Trust under the terms 
of the Lease and Option, and that any representations made by Foley were to the effect that escrow would close and title transferred. The Circuit Court concluded in COL 18 that, "As guarantors of BWC's performance under the Lease, Robinson and Patterson are jointly and severally liable for BWC's breach of its obligation to pay rent." 
BWC does not dispute that Robinson and Patterson signed 
the Guaranty and fails to explain how the FOFs set forth above were not supported by "substantial evidence." See Chun, 106 
Hawai# i at 430, 106 P.3d at 353. The Circuit Court's findings 
reflect a rejection of BWC's argument that Robinson and Patterson never would have signed the Guaranty but-for Foley's material representations, and BWC fails to demonstrate error. See HRAP 
Rule 28(b)(7); Haw. Ventures, LLC, 114 Hawai# i at 480, 164 P.3d 
at 738. 
C. POE 3: Fees and Costs 
Expert witness fees 
BWC argues that the Circuit Court abused its discretion 
when it failed to set aside "the additional travel costs because 
they were more appropriately classified as expert witness fees." 
BWC cites only to the transcript of the hearing on the Motion for 
Review and the Trust's Request for Taxation of Costs.  BWC does 
not specifically cite to or identify which travel costs were more 
appropriately expert witness fees. This argument is waived. See 
HRAP Rule 28(b)(7); Haw. Ventures, LLC, 114 Hawai# i at 480, 164 
P.3d at 738 (citation omitted) ("[T]his court is not obligated to sift through the voluminous record to verify [a party's] inadequately documented contentions.").
Deposition costs 
BWC contends that some of the deposition costs awarded 
were not permitted because (1) they included copies of 
depositions, citing Nani Koolau Co. v. K & M Constr., Inc., 5 Haw. App. 137, 143-44, 681 P.2d 580, 586 (1984); and (2) the cost of Brown's entire deposition was unreasonable, as only one page 
16   
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of his deposition was used at trial and he was not called as a 
witness, citing Mist v. Westin Hotels, Inc., 69 Haw. 192, 201, 738 P.2d 85, 92 (1978) (holding that deposition costs are taxable when deemed reasonable).  HRS § 607-9
7 has been amended since 
Nani Koolau Co. to include "expenses for deposition transcript originals and copies," and BWC's argument that the deposition copies awarded were not permitted is without merit. HRS § 607-9. 
BWC claims that the cost of Brown's entire deposition 
was unreasonable because Brown "was not called as a witness at trial" and that only "a small part of one page" of his deposition was used at trial. BWC's argument is without merit. See Canalez 
v. Bob's Appliance Serv. Ctr., Inc., 89 Hawai# i 292, 308, 972 
P.2d 295, 311 (1999) (holding that the trial court had the discretion to award cost for a deposition testimony that was not used at trial because the testimony was strategically on hand to possibly rebut the opposing party's case in chief); Yoneji v. Yoneji, 137 Hawai# i 299, 319-20, 370 P.3d 704, 724-25 (App. 2016) 
(explaining that whether a deposition cost is reasonable is within the discretion of the trial court and "'hinges upon the trial court's factual evaluation of the course and progress of the proceeding and the nature of the evidence'") (citation omitted). The Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in awarding these deposition costs. See Pulawa
, 112 Hawai# i at 
10-11, 143 P.3d at 1212-13. 
7 HRS § 607-9(b) (2016) provides: 
All actual disbursements, including but not limited to,
intrastate travel expenses for witnesses and counsel,expenses for deposition transcript originals and copies, andother incidental expenses, including copying costs,intrastate long distance telephone charges, and postage,sworn to by an attorney or a party, and deemed reasonable bythe court, may be allowed in taxation of costs. . . . 
(Emphases added). 
17 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Attorney's Fees 
BWC contends that the Circuit Court abused its 
discretion when it failed to further reduce attorney's fees 
because, inter alia, the fees associated with a dismissed claim were not permitted; the fees should be apportioned between assumpsit and non-assumpsit claims; there were improper block billing entries; and time entries for ministerial and clerical work were improperly included. [OB at 33-34.] 
Dismissed claim.  BWC argues that "the fees associated 
with the Trust's claim[,] that it was excused from performance of the Option[,] were not permitted because that claim was voluntarily dismissed by the Trust, therefore making BWC the prevailing party for purposes of Section 607-14,"
8 citing Ranger 
Ins. Co. v. Hinshaw, 103 Hawai# i 26, 31, 79 P.3d 119, 124 (2003) 
(holding that, as a presumption, the prevailing party should recover costs). 
A party "will be deemed to be the successful party for 
the purpose of taxing costs and attorney's fees where that party prevails on the disputed main issue, even though not to the extent of his original contention." Kaleikini v. Yoshioka, 
129 Hawai# i 454, 461, 304 P.3d 252, 259 (2013) (internal 
quotation marks and brackets omitted) (quoting Food Pantry Ltd. v. Waikiki Bus. Plaza, Inc., 58 Haw. 606, 618, 575 P.2d 869, 878 (1978)); see Food Pantry, 58 Haw. at 620, 575 P.2d at 879 (holding that although the trial court refused to allow the lessor to cancel the lease, the lessor was the prevailing party because "[t]he grant of relief was expressly conditioned upon either the lessee (1) cancelling the assignments and subleases or 
8 HRS § 607-14 (2016) states in pertinent part: 
In all the courts, in all actions in the nature of assumpsit
and in all actions on a promissory note or other contract inwriting that provides for an attorney's fee, there shall betaxed as attorneys' fees, to be paid by the losing party andto be included in the sum for which execution may issue, afee that the court determines to be reasonable[.] 
(Emphasis added).

(2) paying the lessor a higher rental for the remainder of the 
term"). 
Here, a Stipulation or Dismissal of Certain Claims and 
Order was filed on February 9, 2015, in which the claim asserted in Count II of the First Amended Complaint, that "Foley's performance and obligations under the Option are excused," was dismissed without prejudice. See Oahu Publ'ns., Inc. v. 
Abercombie, 134 Hawai# i 16, 26, 332 P.3d 159, 169 (2014) ("[A] 
dismissal without prejudice does not alter the legal relationship of the parties because the defendant remains subject to risk of re-filing.") (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The pleadings and proof in this case raised one basic issue: whether the Trust was entitled to rental income from July 1, 2009 to April 27, 2015.
9 The Final Judgment awarded the Trust 
$1,013,385.17 for rental payments from July 1, 2009 to April 27, 2015.  Because the Trust prevailed on the "disputed main issue," 
the Trust was the "successful party for the purpose of taxing 
costs and attorney's fees" under HRS § 607-14. See Kaleikini, 
129 Hawai# i at 461, 304 P.3d at 259; Oahu Publ'ns., Inc., 
134 Hawai# i at 26, 332 P.3d at 169. The Circuit Court did not 
abuse its discretion in awarding attorney's fees associated with Count II of the First Amended Complaint regarding the claim that the Trust's performance and obligations under the Option were excused. See Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Discovery, 134 Hawai# i 
at 254, 339 P.3d at 1055. 
Non-assumpsit claims.  BWC argues that "the fees 
incurred by the Trust should be apportioned between those expended on the assumpsit claims versus the fees expended on defending against the non-assumpsit claims," citing TSA Int'l 
9 The Circuit Court's FOFs, COLs, and Order stated, 
The ultimate issue to now be decided in this case is whether 
defendant BWC Hawaii, LLC, ("BWC") as tenant owed any rentsto landlord, Lynn Brown and Warren Brown as successortrustees of the Foley Family Trust ("Trust") after BWCexercised an option to purchase the demised premise[s] onJune 8, 2009. . . .

 Ltd. v. Shimizu Corp., 92 Hawai# i 243, 264, 990 P.2d 713, 734 
(1999) (holding that in deciding to award fees under HRS § 607-
14, the court must determine the nature of the lawsuit where both assumpsit and non-assumpsit claims are asserted). 
BWC's argument is misplaced. The Circuit Court found 
in its Order Granting Attorney's Fees that the fees were "reasonable under the terms of the Lease[,]" and that the "request for fees is not based solely on assumpsit, but based on contract."  BWC presents no argument why the attorneys' fees were 
unreasonable or unauthorized under the terms of the Lease. See 
DFS Group, L.P. v. Paiea Props., 110 Hawai# i 217, 222, 131 P.3d 
500, 505 (2006) (explaining that when a "'contract in writing 
that provides for an attorney's fee,' the determinative issue is whether the language of the lease authorizes the recovery of attorneys' fees in the present case") (quoting HRS § 607-14 (Supp. 1997)). 
BWC fails to demonstrate that the Circuit Court 
abused its discretion. See Ass'n of Apartment Owners of 
Discovery Bay, 134 Hawai# i at 254, 339 P.3d at 1055. 
Block billing. BWC argues that many of the fees 
"amount to improper block billing making it impossible for the lower court (or this Court) to determine the reasonableness of the time spent on the various tasks undertaken," citing Haw. Ventures, LLC, 116 Hawai# i at 475, 173 P.3d at 1132.  BWC does 
not explain how improper block billing occurred under the authority it relies on. 
In Haw. Ventures, LLC, the Hawai# i 
Supreme Court found that "block billing" occurred because the court was unable to distinguish between compensable and noncompensable billing entries, not the reasonableness of the fees. Id.; see Crowe v. Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Waikiki 
Marina Condo.
, Nos. CAAP-14-0000545 and CAAP-14-0001210, 2019 WL 
1715767, at *5 (App. Apr. 17, 2019) (SDO) (explaining that Haw. Ventures, LLC was distinguishable because "the Circuit Court was examining the 'reasonableness' of the fees, not differentiating between compensable and noncompensable billing entries"). BWC does not offer any analysis or legal citations regarding how the 
20 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Circuit Court erred in awarding attorneys' fees based on block-
billed time entries because the reasonableness of the time spent on various tasks could not be determined, and BWC fails to demonstrate that the Circuit Court abused its discretion. See 
HRAP Rule 28(b)(7); Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Discovery Bay, 134 Hawai# i at 254, 339 P.3d at 1055. 
Clerical/ministerial work. BWC argues that the Trust 
improperly included "legal time entries reflecting billing for ministerial and/or clerical work," citing Jeremiah B. v. Dep't of Educ., Civil No. 09—00262 DAE-LEK, 2010 WL 346454, at *5 (D. Haw. Jan. 29, 2010) (holding that "[c]lerical or ministerial costs are part of an attorney's overhead and are reflected in the charged hourly rate") (finding that communications regarding "hearing dates" and "due dates" are clerical in nature) (citation omitted). 
The Circuit Court had the discretion to determine that 
the challenged fees were "reasonable." See Gailliard v. 
Rawsthorne, 150 Hawai# i 169, 178, 498 P.3d 700, 709 (2021) 
(explaining that it is within the court's discretion in determining whether a fee is reasonable and finding that proofing and revising a brief was reasonable). 
BWC does not explain how 
any of the challenged fees were unreasonable because of their alleged "clerical" or "ministerial" nature, and fails to demonstrate an abuse of discretion. See HRAP Rule 28(b)(7); 
Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Discovery Bay, 134 Hawai# i at 254, 
339 P.3d at 1055.
