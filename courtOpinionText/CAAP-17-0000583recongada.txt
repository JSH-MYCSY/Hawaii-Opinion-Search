APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(Ewa Division)
(CIVIL NO. 1RC17-1-1371)
ORDER GRANTING THE MARCH 8, 2018
MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF DISMISSAL OF THE APPEAL
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginzoa, JJ.)
Upon consideration of the "HRAP Rule 26 Motion for
Relief From Default; or in the Alternative, HRAP Rule 40 Motion
for Reconsideration of Dismissal of the Appeal," filed March 8,
2018, by Defendants-Appellants Gabriel Canencia, Natalie
Canencia, and Ciarah Canencia (the Canencias), the papers in
support, and the record, it appears that:
(1) On December 13, 2017, the appellate clerk notified
the Canencias that the time for filing the statement of
jurisdiction and opening brief had expired on October 6, 2017, NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
and November 6, 2017, respectively, the matter would be called to
the court's attention on December 26, 2017, for appropriate
action, which could include dismissal of the appeal, pursuant to
Hawai#i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rules 12.1(e) and 30,
and any request for relief from default should be made by motion;
(2) The Canencias did not respond to the default
notice; 
(3) On March 6, 2018, the court dismissed the appeal
for failure to file the statement of jurisdiction and opening
brief;
(4) The Canencies seek relief from default of the
opening brief1 or, alternatively, reconsideration of the March 6,
2018 dismissal order because their counsel, Sandra D. Lynch
(Lynch), was unable to contact the Canencias after the notice of
appeal was filed on August 1, 2017, due to the Canencias having
been evicted, living temporarily with friends and family, losing
telephone service, and not contacting Lynch.  Lynch states that
in September 2017, she started drafting the opening brief and
unsuccessfully tried to contact the Canencias concerning
attorney's fees.  After the appellate clerk entered the default
notice on December 13, 2017, Lynch again tried but was unable to
contact the Canencias.  At that point, Lynch believed she no
longer "had a client."  In "late January 2018," Lynch discovered
through a third party that the Canencias had lost a child.  Lynch
searched the local obituaries and learned the Canencias' daughter
had passed away on February 14, 2018.  Lynch states she
subsequently contacted the Canencias through a third party, and
"[b]ased upon the information [Lynch] received, [the Canencias]
want to continue the appeal if at all possible, and [Lynch has]
agreed to represent them pro bono going forward."  The Canencias
assert there is only one issue on appeal and they can file the

opening brief within five days.  They claim they did not
voluntarily abandon their appeal, but instead were unable "to
cope emotionally and financially with an overwhelming situation,
including intermittent homelessness and significant medical
expenses not covered by insurance."  Nonetheless, Lynch
acknowledges it was her responsibility to timely file the opening
brief or request an extension of time but, because she could not
reach the Canencias, it appeared to her that they had abandoned
their appeal;
(5) Even if Lynch believed the Canencias had abandoned
their appeal, she did not inform the court until after she
allowed the Canencias to default on the statement of jurisdiction
and opening brief, and the court had dismissed their appeal. 
Because Hawai# i's appellate courts have "consistently adhered to
the policy of affording litigants the opportunity to have their
cases heard on the merits, where possible," Schefke v. Reliable
Collection Agency, Ltd., 96 Hawai# i 408, 420, 32 P.3d 52, 64
(2001) (citation and quotation marks omitted), the court will
grant the alternative request for reconsideration of the March 6,
2018 dismissal order, but with a caution to Lynch, as set forth
below.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the alternative
motion for reconsideration of the March 6, 2018 Order Dismissing
Appeal is granted, pursuant to HRAP Rule 40, and the appeal is
reinstated.  The deadline to file the statement of jurisdiction
and opening brief is extended to March 22, 2018.  Any further
default of the statement of jurisdiction or opening brief may
result in sanctions, including, without limitation, monetary
sanctions, the appeal being dismissed, or both.  See HRAP 
Rules 12.1(e) & 30.

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Sandra D. Lynch is hereby
cautioned to comply with deadlines set forth in the HRAP, and
future failure to comply may result in sanctions.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, March 15, 2018.
