STATE OF HAWAI #I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
JAMES S. MOORE, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(EWA DIVISION)
(CASE NO. 1DTA-16-02427)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Ginoza and Chan, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant James S. Moore ( Moore) appeals from
the Amended Judgment entered on July 18, 2017 ( Amended Judgment),
by the District Court of the First Circuit, Ewa Division
(District Court ).1
Moore raises a single point of error on appeal,
contending that the District Court erred in failing to require
Moore himself, rather than Moore's attorney, to state whether
Moore was going to remain silent or testify at trial.  The State
agrees, submitting that it cannot make a good faith argument that

the District Court's failure to obtain a direct waiver from Moore
was harmless error.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, as well as the
relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Moore's point of
error as follows: 
The State concedes Moore's point.  Notwithstanding the
State's concession, "appellate courts have an independent duty
'first to ascertain that the confession of error is supported by
the record and well-founded in law and second to determine that
such error is properly preserved and prejudicial.'"  State v.
Veikoso, 102 Hawai# i 219, 221-22, 74 P.3d 575, 577-78 (2003)
(citation omitted). 
Hawai#i law is clear.  A defendant's waiver of his or
her right to testify must be obtained directly from the
defendant, not from the attorney, or the waiver is invalid.  See
State v. Staley, 91 Hawai #i 275, 287, 982 P.2d 904, 916 (1999);
State v. Hoang , 94 Hawai #i 271, 278, 12 P.3d 371, 378 (App.
2000).  The record in this case is also clear, although the
District Court engaged in a colloquy with Moore, the court asked
Moore's attorney, not Moore, whether Moore was going to testify. 
As there is nothing to indicate what Moore would have testified
about, we cannot conclude that the  Tachibana  error constituted
harmless error.  See Hoang, 94 Hawai# i at 279, 12 P.3d at 379.
