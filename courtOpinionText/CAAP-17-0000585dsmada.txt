APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 13-1-0288)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
AND DISMISSING ALL PENDING MOTIONS
(By: Reifurth, Presiding Judge, Ginoza and Chan, JJ.)
Upon review of the record, it appears that Defendant-
Appellant Theodorico Erum, Jr. (Erum), pro se, appeals from the
Honorable Randal G.B. Valenciano's June 30, 2017 judgment in
Civil No. 13-1-0288, but we lack appellate jurisdiction because
the appeal is untimely under Rules 4(a)(1) and 26(a) of the
Hawai#i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP).NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
The June 30, 2017 judgment and the accompanying
June 30, 2017 writ of ejectment were immediately appealable under
Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 641-1(a) (2016) and the Forgay
doctrine, see Forgay v. Conrad , 47 U.S. 201 (1848), because
(1) they collectively required immediate execution of a command
that real property be delivered to Erum's adversary, and (2) the
losing party, Erum, would be subjected to irreparable injury if
appellate review had to wait the final outcome of the litigation. 
See, e.g., Ciesla v. Reddish , 78 Hawai #i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702,
704 (1995); Lambert v. Teisina, 131 Hawai #i 457, 462, 319 P.3d
376, 381 (2014).
"When a civil appeal is permitted by law, the notice of
appeal shall be filed within 30 days after entry of the judgment
or appealable order."  HRAP Rule 4(a)(1).  The thirtieth day
after June 30, 2017, was Sunday, July 30, 2017, which HRAP
Rule 26(a) automatically extended to Monday, July 31, 2017.  Erum
filed his notice of appeal on August 2, 2017.  The failure to
file a timely notice of appeal in a civil matter is a
jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot waive and the
appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise of judicial
discretion.  Bacon v. Karlin , 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127,
1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or justice is
authorized to change the jurisdictional requirements contained in
Rule 4 of these rules."); HRAP Rule 26(e) ("The reviewing court
for good cause shown may relieve a party from a default
occasioned by any failure to comply with these rules, except the
failure to give timely notice of appeal.").  Therefore, we lack
appellate jurisdiction over Erum's appeal.
Accordingly,  IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is
dismissed.

IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions
