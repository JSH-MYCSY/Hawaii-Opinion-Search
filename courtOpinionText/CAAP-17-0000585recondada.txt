APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 13-1-0288)
ORDER DENYING MARCH 1, 2018 HRAP RULE 40 MOTION TO
RECONSIDER FEBRUARY 15, 2018 ORDER DISMISSING
APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By: Reifurth, Presiding Judge, Ginoza and Chan, JJ.)
Upon review of (1) the February 15, 2018 order
dismissing appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction, (2) the
March 1, 2018 motion by Defendant-Appellant Theodorico Erum, Jr.
(Erum), pro se, requesting reconsideration of the February 15,
2018 order of dismissal pursuant to Rule 40 of the Hawai #i Rules
of Appellate Procedure (HRAP), and (3) the record, it appears
that Erum's March 1, 2018 HRAP Rule 40 motion for reconsideration
is untimely because Erum filed it more than ten days after theNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
filing of the February 15, 2018 order of dismissal in violation
of HRAP Rule 40(a).  Furthermore, we did not overlook or
misapprehend any point of law or fact when we entered the
February 15, 2018 order of dismissal.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Erum's March 1,
2018 HRAP Rule 40 motion for reconsideration of the February 15,
2018 order of dismissal is denied.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, March 7, 2018.
