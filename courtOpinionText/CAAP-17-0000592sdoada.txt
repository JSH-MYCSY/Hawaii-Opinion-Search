CHARLES (TED) & DARLENE JOHNS,
Appellants,
v.
BOARD OF WATER SUPPLY DEPARTMENT OF WATER
SUPPLY COUNTY OF MAUI, Appellees
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 17-1-0156(2))
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Ginoza, C.J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
Appellants-Appellants Charles T. Johns and Darlene T.
Johns (collectively, the Johnses ) appeal from a Final Judgment
entered on July 13, 2017, and challenge an underlying "Order
Granting Appellee County of Maui Department of Water Supply's
Motion to Dismiss Appeal for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction
with Prejudice," both entered by the Circuit Court of the Second
Circuit ( circuit court).1  The circuit court concluded that
because the Johnses' notice of appeal to that court was untimely,
it lacked jurisdiction to hear the Johnses' appeal from the
County of Maui Board of Water Supply's "Findings of Fact,
Conclusions of Law, and Decision and Order" ( Board's Order).

In their appeal to this court, the Johnses argue that
the circuit court erred in calculating the deadline to appeal the
Board's Order because: (1) the time period to appeal should be
triggered from the date they received the Board's Order -- March
20, 2017 -- rather than the date the Board's Order was mailed;
and (2) their mailing of the Notice of Appeal on April 17, 2017
was within the required time period. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve the
Johnses' points of error as follows and affirm.
We review de novo whether the circuit court had
jurisdiction over the Johnses' appeal from the Board's Order. 
Rivera v. Dep't of Labor & Indus. Relations, 100 Hawai #i 348,
349, 60 P.3d 298, 299 (2002).2
With regard to the Johnses' first point of error,
Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) ยง 91-14(b) (Supp. 2017) provides
that proceedings for judicial review of an agency contested case
decision "shall be instituted in the circuit court . . . within
thirty days after the preliminary ruling or within thirty days
after service  of the certified copy of the final decision and
order of the agency pursuant to rule of court [.]"  (emphasis
added).  The "rule of court" referenced in HRS ยง 91-14(b) refers
to the Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP), of which Rules
5(b)(3), 6(a), 6(e), and 72(b) are applicable to the instant
case.  Rivera, 100 Hawai #i at 349, 60 P.3d at 299.
2  We disagree with the assertion by Appellee-Appellee County of Maui
Department of Water Supply ( County) that because the circuit court lacked
jurisdiction, we lack appellate jurisdiction.  The County's reliance on Rivera
for this proposition is incorrect because in Rivera the Hawai #i Supreme Court
exercised appellate jurisdiction and affirmed the circuit court's ruling in
that case that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction.  100 Hawai #i at 349, 60
P.3d at 299.  See also Koga Eng'g & Constr., Inc. v. State, 122 Hawai #i 60,
84, 222 P.3d 979, 1003 (2010) ("when reviewing a case where the circuit court
lacked subject matter jurisdiction, the appellate court retains jurisdiction,
not on the merits, but for the purpose of correcting the error in
jurisdiction.") (citation, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted). 
Here, the Johnses timely filed their Notice of Appeal to this court from the
circuit court's July 13, 2017 Final Judgment.

In turn, HRCP Rule 5(b)(3) allows for service by mail
and provides that "[s]ervice by mail is complete upon mailing." 
See also Rivera , 100 Hawai #i at 349, 60 P.3d at 299.  However,
when service of a contested case decision is by mail, as it was
in this case, HRCP Rule 6(e) allows two additional days for the
party receiving the mail to file a notice of appeal:
(e) Additional time after service by mail .  Whenever a
party has the right or is required to do some act or take
some proceedings within a prescribed period after the
service of a notice or other paper upon him and the notice
or paper is served upon him by mail, 2 days shall be added
to the prescribed period.
(Emphasis added.)  See Rivera , 100 Hawai #i at 349, 60 P.3d at
299.
Here, the Certificate of Service for the Board's Order
provides that the Board's Order was mailed to the Johnses on
Thursday, March 16, 2017.  Because the Board's Order was served
by mail, HRCP Rule 6(e) was triggered and the Johnses had two
additional days to file their notice of appeal in the circuit
court.  Thus, the Johnses had thirty-two days, ending on Monday,
April 17, 2017, within which to file their notice of appeal with
the circuit court.3
The Johnses assert that they mailed their notice of
appeal to the circuit court on Monday, April 17, 2017.  This
notice of appeal was filed in the circuit court on Thursday,
April 20, 2017,4 which was three days beyond the prescribed
3 The Johnses contend that the envelope in which they received the
Board's Order by mail was postmarked March 17, 2017.  In the circuit court,
they attached an unverified copy of an envelope as an appendix to their May
12, 2017 "Motion to Reverse Appellees Motion to Dismiss Appeal for Lack of
Jurisdiction."  This envelope shows a postmark date of "MAR 17 2017[.]" 
Even if we calculate the time to appeal based on the Board's Order being
mailed on March 17, 2017, the Johnses' notice of appeal would still be
untimely.  Their thirty-two day window in which to file the notice of appeal
with the circuit court would have ended on Tuesday, April 18, 2017.  See HRCP
Rules 5(b)(3), 6(a) and (e).  Again, the Johnses' notice of appeal filed on
April 20, 2017 would be untimely under these circumstances as well.
4  The Johnses do not contend that the circuit court received the
notice of appeal prior to April 20, 2017, and there is nothing in the record
to indicate that the circuit court received the notice of appeal prior to its
filing date.

period.
In their second point of error, the Johnses contend
that the circuit court should have calculated the submission date
for their notice of appeal based on the date they mailed it,
rather than the date the notice of appeal was actually filed in
the circuit court.  We cannot agree.  As noted, HRS ยง 91-14(b)
requires that proceedings for judicial review shall be instituted
in the circuit court pursuant to rule of court, i.e.  the HRCP. 
See Rivera , 100 Hawai #i at 349, 60 P.3d at 299.  HRCP Rule 72,
the applicable rule for appeals to the circuit court from agency
decisions, requires that "[t]he notice of appeal shall be filed
in the circuit court within 30 days[.]" (emphasis added); see
also Price v. Zoning Bd. of Appeals of the City & Cty. of
Honolulu, 77 Hawai# i 168, 171, 883 P.2d 629, 632 (1994).  HRCP
Rule 5(e), titled "Filing with the court defined" provides that
"[t]he filing of pleadings and other papers with the court as
required by these rules shall be made by filing them with the
clerk of the court[.]"  Accordingly, the Johnses did not "file"
their appeal within the prescribed period.
Because the Johnses' appeal from the Board's Order was
not filed in a timely manner in the circuit court, the circuit
court properly dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction. 
Rivera, 100 Hawai #i at 352, 60 P.3d at 302.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Final
Judgment, entered by the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit on
July 13, 2017, is affirmed.
