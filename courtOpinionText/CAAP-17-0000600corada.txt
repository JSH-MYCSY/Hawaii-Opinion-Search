ORDER OF CORRECTION 
(By:

1 Leonard, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Nakasone, JJ. FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Opinion of the Court, filed on December 22, 2022, 
is hereby corrected as follows: 
1. On page 11, in footnote 11, the reference to 
"
Merrian-Webster" should be replaced with "Merriam-Webster" so 
that as corrected, the sentence reads: "Spondylosis, Merriam-
Webster, https://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/spondylosis (last visited Dec. 14, 2022)." 
2. On page 12, in the last line of the first partial 
paragraph should should be indented to appear as: 
occasional needle sensation in both hands and stiffness in 
the morning. [Pave] also reported bowel and bladder controlproblems and difficulty with sexual function. 
3. On page 21, in line 4 in the block quote from 
Bumanglag v. Oahu Sugar Co., 78 Hawai# i 275, 278, 892 P.2d 468, 
471 (1995), the word "lumber" should be changed to "lumbar," to 
read as follows: 
Even if we were to accept Dr. Hendrickson's opinion as to
[Bumanglag]'s preexisting impairment for his low back
condition, and apply it to the highest permanent impairmentrating for the lumbar region (11% of the whole person), 20to 25% of 11% would provide, at most, 2.75% preexistingpermanent partial disability of the whole person. Permanent partial disability of 2.75% of the whole person is equal to10.71 weeks of compensation . . . . It has not been shown that [Bumanglag] has a preexisting permanent partialdisability of 32 weeks of compensation necessary to warrantapportionment with SCF. 
The clerk of the court is directed to take all 
necessary steps to notify the publishing agencies of these 
changes.
