APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
(CASE NO. AB 2015-259(H)(S) (DCD No. 1-87-00882))
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
Upon review of the record, it appears that Claimant/
Appellant/Appellant Dwight J. Vicente (Vicente), pro se, appeals
from two August 1, 2017 interlocutory orders that the Labor and
Industrial Appeals Board1 (LIRAB) entered in Vicente's appeal in
LIRAB Case No. 2015-259(H)(S) from the Director of the Department
of Labor and Industrial Relations' (Director) June 3, 2015
decision regarding Vincente's claim for further workers'
compensation benefits for a May 3, 1987 injury.  We lack

appellate jurisdiction because the LIRAB has not yet entered an
appealable final decision and order in the underlying case.
An aggrieved party may appeal a final decision and
order by the LIRAB directly to the Hawai #i Intermediate Court of
Appeals pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 386-88 (2015)
and HRS § 91-14(a) (2012 & Supp. 2017).  The appealability of a
decision and order of the LIRAB is governed by HRS § 91-14(a). 
Bocalbos v. Kapiolani Med. Ctr. , 89 Hawai #i 436, 439, 974 P.2d
1026, 1029 (1999).
For purposes of HRS § 91-14(a), we have defined "final
order" to mean an order ending the proceedings, leaving
nothing further to be accomplished. . . .  Consequently, an
order is not final if the rights of a party involved remain
undetermined or if the matter is retained for further
action.
Id. (citation and some internal quotation marks omitted).  "[A]n
order that finally adjudicates a benefit or penalty under the
worker's compensation law is an appealable final order under HRS
§ 91-14(a), although other issues remain."  Lindinha v. Hilo
Coast Processing Co., 104 Hawai #i 164, 168, 86 P.3d 973, 977
(2004) (citation omitted).  But when a determination of a
claimant's workers' compensation claim for benefits "has not been
made[,] . . . the requisite degree of finality is lacking with
respect to th[e] case[,]" and the appellate court lacks
jurisdiction.  Mitchell v. State Dep't of Educ. , 77 Hawai #i 305,
308, 884 P.2d 368, 371 (1994) (dismissing for lack of
jurisdiction an appeal from a LIRAB decision that adjudicated
some, but not all, compensation issues in a workers' compensation
matter).
In the instant case, the two August 1, 2017
interlocutory orders do not finally determine the substantive
issues in the underlying LIRAB case, and the matter is pending
final disposition before the LIRAB.  There do not appear to be
any exceptions to the finality requirement that apply here. 
Absent an appealable final decision and order by the LIRAB on the
substantive issues, Vicente's appeal is premature and we lack
jurisdiction.
