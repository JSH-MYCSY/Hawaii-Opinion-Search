IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI #I,
Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
JAROD SHINSATO, aka Jarod R. Shinsato,
Defendant-Appellee
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CR. NO. 16-1-1534)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Chan, JJ.)
Plaintiff-Appellant the State of Hawai# i (State)
appeals from the "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order
Granting in Part and Denying in Part Motion to Suppress
Statements and Evidence, Filed By Defendant on February 22, 2017,
and Supplemental Motion to Suppress Statements and Evidence,
Filed by Defendant on June 19, 2017" (FOF/COL/Order on Motion to
Suppress) entered on July 12, 2017 in the Circuit Court of the
First Circuit (circuit court).1
On September 28, 2016, the State charged Defendant-
Appellee, Jarod Shinsato (Shinsato) with one count of Habitually
Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant in
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61.5(a)(1),
(2)(A), and (2)(C), and one count of Driving Without License in
1The Honorable Christine E. Kuriyama presided.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
violation of HRS § 286-102.
On June 19, 2017, Shinsato moved to suppress, among
other things, his statements "[m]ade on February 6, 2016, at
around 2:07 am, while in his vehicle located on Kalanianaole
Highway."
On July 12, 2017, the circuit court suppressed
Shinsato's statement "I just came from a bar" on the grounds that
the statement "was the result of an interrogation that occurred
while he was in custody or 'otherwise deprived of his freedom by
the authorities in any significant way', and that the statement
was illegally secured and was obtained in violation of his
constitutional rights."
In the instant appeal, the State contends that the
circuit court erred in suppressing Shinsato's statement, "I just
came from a bar," on the grounds that the statement was the
result of a non-Mirandized custodial interrogation.2
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we vacate and remand
the case for further proceedings.
The facts of this case are very similar to the facts
presented in State v. Wyatt, 67 Haw. 293, 687 P.2d 544 (1984),
and in State v. Kuba , 68 Haw. 184, 706 P.2d 1305 (1985).  In both
cases, the supreme court noted that
the stopping of an automobile and the detaining of its
occupants for a brief period during a traffic stop
constituted a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth and
Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution
under Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 59
L.Ed.2d 660 (1979).  [Wyatt, 67 Haw. at 299, 687 P.2d at
549].  Where, however, the seizure of the defendant is
reasonable to investigate a traffic violation and the
investigating police officer engages in legitimate,
straightforward, and noncoercive questioning necessary to
obtain information to issue a traffic citation, there is no
custodial interrogation; no Miranda warnings are required
before the police officer begins asking questions.  Id. at
[299-300], 687 P.2d at 549–50.
Kuba, 68 Haw. at 188, 706 P.2d at 1309.
2  Shinsato's trial has been discontinued until after the resolution of
the instant appeal.

In Wyatt, police officers pulled Wyatt's car over for
driving without headlights on at night.  Wyatt, 67 Haw. at 296,
687 P.2d at 547.  While Wyatt was rummaging for her driver's
license and other documentation requested by the police officers,
one of the police officers smelled an intoxicating liquor
emanating from the inside of the car.  Id.  at 296-97, 687 P.2d at
548.  The officer then asked Wyatt if she had been drinking,
which she admitted to.  Id. at 297, 687 P.2d at 548.  The supreme
court held that the roadside questioning of Wyatt that led to an
utterance of an inculpatory statement by Wyatt was not "motivated
by subterfuge or trickery" nor "intimidating or inherently
coercive," and thus "did not rise to the level of interrogation
calling for Miranda warnings ."  Id. at 299-300, 687 P.2d at 549-
50.
In Kuba, a police officer stopped Kuba's car after
observing it traveling at an abnormally slow speed and straddling
two lanes.  Kuba , 68 Haw. at 189, 706 P.2d at 1310.  The officer
told Kuba why he was being stopped and that he suspected Kuba of
driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor.  Id.  at 185,
706 P.2d at 1307.  Kuba responded that he had consumed four beers
earlier, to which the officer asked Kuba if he "normally gets
wasted on four beers."  Id.   Kuba then responded that he had also
smoked marijuana.  Id. at 185-86, 706 P.2d at 1307.  The supreme
court, noting that the facts of Kuba were "almost
indistinguishable from the facts presented in [Wyatt]," held that
the officer's questioning of Kuba did not rise to the level of
custodial interrogation requiring that Miranda warnings be given.
Id. at 188-189, 706 P.2d at 1309-1310.
In the instant case, Officer Brissette observed
Shinsato's vehicle swerving and speeding on Kalanianaole Highway
and suspected that Shinsato might be driving under the influence.
After pulling Shinsato over, Officer Brissette observed
Shinsato's physical demeanor, smelled the odor of alcohol, and
saw that Shinsato's face was flushed and that his eyes were red
and glassy.  Officer Brissette then informed Shinsato that he was
being stopped for speeding and swerving, then asked Shinsato why
he was swerving so badly or whether there was a reason that he
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
was swerving so badly.  Shinsato replied, "I just came from a
bar."
In suppressing Shinsato's statement that "[he] just
came from a bar," the circuit court reasoned that "[i]n light of
the totality of the circumstances presented, Officer Brissette's
question to Defendant about why he was swerving so badly, or was
there a reason for Defendant swerving so badly, constituted more
than a general investigatory question and was inquisitive,
intrusive, coercive and/or accusatory in nature," therefore,
Shinsato should have been given his Miranda warnings prior to
Officer Brissette's question.  We disagree.  Officer Brissette
asking why Shinsato was swerving, after informing Shinsato that
he had observed Shinsato's car swerving, was straightforward and
noncoercive, and therefore, did not rise to the level of
interrogation requiring Miranda  warnings.  Accordingly, we
conclude that the trial court erred in suppressing Shinsato's
statement, "I just came from a bar."
Based on the foregoing, we vacate the circuit court's
"Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting in Part
and Denying in Part Motion to Suppress Statements and Evidence,
Filed By Defendant on February 22, 2017, and Supplemental Motion
to Suppress Statements and Evidence, Filed by Defendant on
June 19, 2017" entered on July 12, 2017, and remand the case for
further proceedings consistent with this Summary Disposition
Order.
