STATE OF HAWAI#I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
JOSEPH WILLIAMS-GARCIA, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CRIMINAL NO. 15-1-1922 (1PC151001922))
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Ginoza, C.J., and Leonard and Wadsworth, JJ.)
Plaintiff-Appellant State of Hawai#i (State) appeals from
the July 12, 2017 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order
Granting [Defendant-Appellee Joseph Williams-Garcia's ( Williams-
Garcia)] Motion to Dismiss Count III of the Superseding
Indictment for Violation of Defendant's Due Process Rights
(FOFs/COLs ), entered in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
(Circuit Court).  1/
The State contends that the Circuit Court erred in
dismissing Count III, Theft in the Second Degree:  (1) on the
ground that the charging language failed to allege the requisite
state of mind as to certain parts of the charge, in violation of
Williams-Garcia's due process rights; and (2) with prejudice,
based on the Hawai# i Supreme Court's decision in State v.
Estencion, 63 Haw. 264, 625 P.2d 1040 (1981).  The State also
challenges certain related findings of fact and conclusions of
law in the FOFs/COLs.
1/The Honorable Rom A. Trader presided.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
After reviewing the record on appeal and the relevant
legal authorities, and giving due consideration to the issues
raised and the arguments advanced by the parties, we resolve the
State's contentions as follows.
I.  BACKGROUND
On December 9, 2015, and December 23, 2015,
respectively, the State filed an Indictment and Superseding
Indictment (indictment), both of which charged Williams-Garcia
with Theft in the Second Degree, in the following language:
COUNT 3:  On or about December 3, 2015, in the City
and County of Honolulu, State of Hawai #i, JOSEPH
WILLIAMS-GARCIA, did obtain or exert unauthorized control
over the property of [AV], the value of which exceeds Three
Hundred Dollars ($300.00), with intent to deprive [AV] of
the property, thereby committing the offense of Theft in the
Second Degree, in violation of Section 708-831(1)(b) of the
Hawai[]i Revised Statutes.
(Count III ).   
At the time, Hawaii Revised Statutes (H
RS) § 708-
831(1)(b) (2014) provided:  "A person commits the offense of
theft in the second degree if the person commits theft . . . [of]
property or services the value of which exceeds $300."  HRS §
708-830(1) (2014) defines "theft," as follows:  "A person commits
theft if the person . . . [o]btains or exerts unauthorized
control over the property of another with intent to deprive the
other of the property." 
On May 5, 2017, Williams-Garcia moved to dismiss Count
III with prejudice, arguing that the charging language failed to
include the required state of mind as to:  (1) "obtain[ing] or
exert[ing] unauthorized control over the property of another";
and (2) the value of the property.   
At the June 27, 2017 hearing of the motion, the court
indicated that it would dismiss Count III, but would hear
arguments on whether the dismissal should be with or without
prejudice.  The court explained that because the State repeatedly
failed to include the correct charging language, the court would
look to the factors in Estencion to determine if the dismissal
should be with or without prejudice. 
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
The July 12, 2017 FOFs/COLs stated in relevant part:
FINDINGS OF FACT
. . . .
4.Both the Indictment and the Superseding
Indictment omit the mens rea  requirement for the essential
elements as to Defendant’s state of mind as to the value of
the property and Defendant’s state of mind as it pertains to
"obtain or exert unauthorized control over property".
. . . .
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
. . . .
3."Requiring mens rea  to be included in each
element of the offense charged 'alerts defendants of
precisely what they need to defend against to avoid a
conviction.'"  [State v. Gaub, No. CAAP 16-0000547, 2017 WL
213153, at *4 (Haw. App. Jan. 18, 2017) (SDO)].
4.Based on Hawaii Supreme court decisions, a
charging document "must reflect the mens rea  of intent
related to the value of the property when a person is
charged with an offense of theft."  Gaub at 7.
5.Additionally, even though the "statute does not
expressly provide a mens rea  before the language 'obtains or
exerts unauthorized control over the property of another',
the mens rea of intent also attaches to obtaining or
exerting unauthorized control over the property of another."
Gaub at 10.
6.Because Count III of the Superseding Indictment
in the instant case fails to allege the requisite state of
mind as to the valuation element of the offense as well as
the element of obtaining and exerting unauthorized control
over the property, it is deficient for failing to provide
fair notice to Defendant thereby violating Defendant's due
process rights.
7.Because the language in Count III of the
Superseding Indictment is fatally defective, this Court must
grant Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Count III. 
8.In determining whether to dismiss the instant
case, with or without prejudice, the Court must consider and
apply the factors listed in [Estencion].
9.These factors are:  "the seriousness of the
offense, the facts and the circumstances of the case which
led to the dismissal, and the impact of reprosecution on the
administration of justice must be considered."  [Id.] at
269, 625 P.2d at 1044.
10.In evaluating the seriousness of the offense,
while Count III is a Class C felony, which carries a
potential five-year prison term, standing alone, it could be
viewed as serious, but when compared to other Class C
felonies and considering Defendant is charged with one Class
A felony, one Class B felony, two other Class C felonies,
and one misdemeanor, the Count III offense of Theft in the
Second Degree is not serious under this analysis. 
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
11.The facts and circumstances of the case leading
to a dismissal that weigh in favor of the Defense include
the number of offenses remaining which Defendant still faces
in the instant case, as well as the fact that this case was
charged back in December 2015 and is currently pending trial
the week of August 21, 2017.
12.The State had two opportunities to correctly
charge Defendant and failed to do so, and the impact of
reprosecution and the administration of justice would be
thwarted if the State were to get a third opportunity.
13.To permit the State to come back and refile
Count III of the above-entitled case, by dismissing said
Count without prejudice, would impact the current trial
date.
14.Fundamental fairness to Defendant requires that
the dismissal be with prejudice.
II.  DISCUSSION
A. Insufficiency of Count III
The State argues that the Circuit Court erred in
dismissing Count III, asserting that the charging language
sufficiently apprised Williams-Garcia of the state of mind that
he needed to defend against. 
The Hawai#i Supreme Court has held that a criminal
charge must set out the applicable state of mind, or mens rea, to
satisfy due process requirements.  See State v. Nesmith, 127
Hawai#i 48, 53, 276 P.3d 617, 622 (2012).  In Nesmith, the
supreme court noted that "[i]n some cases, . . . a charge
tracking the language of the statute defining the offense
nevertheless violates an accused's due process rights."  Id. 
Though not an element of the offense, applicable states of mind
are "required to be included in the charges against the
defendants in order 'to alert the defendants of precisely what
they needed to defend against to avoid a conviction.'"  State v.
Gonzalez, 128 Hawai# i 314, 324, 288 P.3d 788, 798 (2012) (quoting
Nesmith, 127 Hawai#i at 56, 276 P.3d at 625).  Further, "[a]
charge that fails to charge a requisite state of mind cannot be
construed reasonably to state an offense and thus the charge is
dismissed without prejudice because it violates due process." 
State v. Apollonio, 130 Hawai#i 353, 359, 311 P.3d 676, 682
(2013).
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
Regarding theft statutes, prior decisions of this court
and the Hawai# i Supreme Court support the Circuit Court's ruling
here that the mens rea of intent applies to the value of the
property involved in the theft.  See State v. Cabrera, 90 Hawai# i
359, 978 P.2d 797 (1999); State v. Mitchell, 88 Hawai# i 216, 965
P.2d 149 (App. 1998).  Although Cabrera and Mitchell addressed
whether jury instructions were appropriate, "both cases held that
the mens rea of intent applied with regard to the value of the
property involved in the respective case."  State v. Gaub, No.
CAAP 15-0000547, 2017 WL 213153, at *3 (Haw. App. Jan. 18, 2017)
(SDO) (explaining the rulings in Cabrera and Mitchell).
In Gaub, this court applied the rulings in Cabrera and
Mitchell to assess the sufficiency of a charge of Theft in the
Second Degree under HRS §§ 708-831(1)(b), based on alternative
types of "theft" under HRS § 708-830(1) and (7).  Regarding the
former alternative, the court concluded:
[T]he offense charged against [the defendant] in this case
based on HRS §§ 708-831(1)(b) and 708-830(1) requires
establishing, inter alia, that [the defendant] had an
intentional state of mind regarding the value of the
property being in excess of $300.  Given this requirement,
and in light of the Hawai #i Supreme Court cases related to
the inclusion of applicable mens rea in charging documents,
the charge against [the defendant] must have reflected the
mens rea of intent related to the value of the property.
 
Gaub, 2017 WL 213153, at *5.  The relevant charge in Gaub stated
that the defendant "obtained or exerted unauthorized control over
the property of another, TIRE(S) belonging to LEX BRODIE TIRE AND
SERVICE the value of which exceeded $300.00 with intent to
deprive the owner of the property."  Id. at *6 (emphasis
omitted).   Because this charging language "[could ]not
reasonably be read such that [the defendant] was put on notice
that he committed the alleged conduct with the intent that the
value of the property exceeded $300[,]" this court affirmed the
circuit court's dismissal of the charge under HRS §§ 708-
831(1)(b) and 708-830(1).   Id. at *5-6.2/
2/This court also affirmed dismissal of the alternative charge under
HRS § 708-831(1)(b) and 708-830(7), based on a similar deficiency.  Gaub, 2017
WL 213153, at *5-*6.
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
Similarly, here, Count III of the indictment states, in
relevant part, that Williams-Garcia "did obtain or exert
unauthorized control over the property of [AV], the value of
which exceeds Three Hundred Dollars ($300.00), with intent to
deprive [AV] of the property[.]"  This language, like the
language at issue in Gaub, cannot reasonably be read to allege
that the mens rea of intent attaches to the valuation element of
the charge, and Williams-Garcia thus "was not alerted 'of
precisely what [he] needed to defend against to avoid a
conviction.'"  Id. at *6 (quoting Gonzales, 128 Hawai# i at 324,
288 P.3d at 798).
In Gaub, this court further ruled that under Mitchell,
the mens rea of intent also attaches to "obtain[ing] or
exert[ing] unauthorized control over the property of another."  
Id. at *6.  See HRS § 708-830(1).  This court concluded that the
charge in that case did not sufficiently inform the defendant
that he must have had the intent to obtain or exert unauthorized
control over the property at issue, and he was not alerted of
what he needed to defend against to avoid a conviction.  Gaub,
2017 WL 213153, at *6 (citing Gonzales, 128 at 324, 288 P.3d at
798).
Similarly, here, the relevant portion of Count III does
not specify the mens rea of intent before the alleged conduct of
obtaining or exerting unauthorized control.  Like its counterpart
in Gaub, Count III is fatally deficient.
The State tries to distinguish Gaub, arguing that HRS
§ 708-830(7), the basis for one of the alternative theft charges
in Gaub, includes two states of mind (both intentional and
knowing states), and "[w]ith two states of mind alleged, the
charge was unclear as to which state of mind applied to the
valuation of the property element."  We cannot reconcile this
argument with our analysis in Gaub, where we independently
assessed the sufficiency of each alternative charge.  We did not
explicitly or implicitly link the insufficiency of the charge
based on HRS § 708-830(1) to any perceived lack of clarity in the
alternative charge based on § 708-830(7).  We concluded that the
charge based on HRS § 708-830(1) was insufficient because the
6NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
charging language did not reflect the mens rea of intent related
to: (1) the value of the property, and (2) obtaining or exerting
unauthorized control over the property.  2017 WL 213153, at *5. 
The charging language here is almost identical to the language
found to be deficient in Gaub.  The language here is likewise
deficient.  
The State also relies on HRS § 702-207 (2014), which
provides that "[w]hen the definition of an offense specifies the
state of mind sufficient for the commission of that offense,
without distinguishing among the elements thereof, the specified
state of mind shall apply to all elements of the offense, unless
a contrary purpose plainly appears."  According to the State,
because Count III "contained only one state of mind – intent,"
that "one state of mind applied to all elements," and "the
indictment sufficiently notified Williams-Garcia of the state of
mind he was required to defend against."  Such "notice" would
presumably depend upon his reading HRS § 702-207 and replicating
the State's conclusory legal analysis.  This argument finds no
support in the relevant case law, is inconsistent with Gaub, and
gives far too short shrift to the Hawai#i Supreme Court cases
concerning the inclusion of applicable mens rea in charging
documents.  For the reasons previously stated, Count III did not
properly notify Williams-Garcia of what he needed to defend
against to avoid a conviction.  The Circuit Court did not err in
dismissing Count III on that ground.  3/
B. Dismissal With Prejudice
The State argues, and we conclude, that the Circuit
Court erred in dismissing Count III with prejudice, based on the
Hawai#i Supreme Court's decision in Estencion.
The supreme court "adhere[s] to this core principle:  A
charge that fails to charge a requisite state of mind cannot be
construed reasonably to state an offense and thus the charge is
3/In light of our conclusion, we also reject the State's related
arguments that FOF 4 was clearly erroneous and COLs 3 through 7 were wrong. 
We note that in COLs 3 through 5, the Circuit Court incorrectly used quotation
marks when paraphrasing certain statements in Gaub.  While the court should
not have used quotation marks in this manner, the substance of the COLs was
not wrong.
7NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
dismissed without prejudice because it violates due process."
Apollonio, 130 Hawai #i at 359, 311 P.3d at 682 (citing State v.
Elliot, 77 Hawai#i 309, 313, 884 P.2d 372, 376 (1994); Nesmith,
127 Hawai#i at 56, 276 P.3d at 625).  Indeed, the supreme court
has repeatedly ruled that dismissal without prejudice is the
appropriate remedy where a charge is dismissed for failing to
allege the required state of mind.  See Apollonio, 130 Hawai#i at
358-59, 311 P.3d at 681-82; Gonzalez, 128 Hawai#i at 324, 288
P.3d at 798; State v. Maharaj, 131 Hawai#i 215, 219, 317 P.3d
659, 663 (2013).
Here, rather than apply these authorities, the Circuit
Court dismissed Count III with prejudice, based on an assessment
of the factors listed in Estencion.  There, however, the circuit
court dismissed a burglary charge against the defendant pursuant
to Hawai# i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 48,  which
expressly gives the court discretion to dismiss a charge with or
without prejudice when the prescribed time limits for trial
expire.  On review, the supreme court set out several factors for
the trial court to consider in determining whether to dismiss a
charge with or without prejudice for violation of HRPP Rule 48.
Estencion, 63 Haw. at 269, 625 P.2d at 1044.  4/
4/HRPP Rule 48 provides, in relevant part:
DISMISSAL.

(b) By court.  Except in the case of traffic offenses
that are not punishable by imprisonment, the court shall, on
motion of the defendant, dismiss the charge, with or without
prejudice in its discretion, if trial is not commenced
within 6 months:
(1) from the date of arrest if bail is set or from the
filing of the charge, whichever is sooner, on any offense
based on the same conduct or arising from the same criminal
episode for which the arrest or charge was made; or
(2) from the date of re-arrest or re-filing of the
charge, in cases where an initial charge was dismissed upon
motion of the defendant[.]

(c) Excluded Periods .  The following periods shall be

8NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
Here, there was no violation of HRPP Rule 48.  Under
these circumstances, the circuit court erred in applying the
Estencion factors rather than the above-cited authorities, which
required dismissal of Count III without prejudice.
In light of the above, we conclude that COLs 8-14 are
also wrong, because they are based on the Circuit Court's
erroneous application of the Estencion factors. 
III.  CONCLUSION
For these reasons, we affirm that portion of the 
Circuit Court's July 12, 2017 FOFs/COLs that dismissed Count III,
and vacate that portion that dismissed Count III with prejudice. 
This case is remanded to the Circuit Court with instructions to
dismiss Count III without prejudice, and for further proceedings
consistent with this Summary Disposition Order.
