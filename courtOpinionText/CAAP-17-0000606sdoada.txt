CALVIN D. ELIZARES, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P. NO. 17-1-0007(2); CR. NOS. 98-0463(2), 99-0076(2))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Calvin D. Elizares (Elizares)
 
appeals from the July 31, 2017 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of
 
Law, and Judgment Denying Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or
 Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner from Custody (Order
 
Denying Petition), entered by the Circuit Court of the Second
 Circuit (Circuit Court).

After a jury trial in the underlying criminal
 
proceeding, Elizares was found guilty of various charges, and on
 
June 28, 2000, the Circuit Court entered a Judgment Guilty
 Conviction and Sentence (Judgment) that, inter alia, imposed an

extended term of imprisonment of life with parole on two counts.2 
On May 23, 2017, Elizares filed a petition for post-conviction 
relief pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 
40 (Petition), arguing that his sentence was illegal on various 
grounds, including the one raised in this appeal. Thereafter, 
the Circuit Court entered the Order Denying Petition, concluding that Elizares had failed to establish a colorable claim. 
On appeal, Elizares contends that the Circuit Court
 
erred in denying the Petition, arguing that his extended sentence
 was illegal because it was imposed by a judge and not based on a
 jury's findings supporting the extended term.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Elizares's point of error as follows: 
Based on the Hawai' i Supreme Court's opinion in 
Flubacher v. State, 142 Hawai' i 109, 414 P.3d 161 (2018), we 
agree. In Flubacher, the State conceded, and the supreme court concluded that "any extended term sentence imposed after June 26, 
2000, in which the court, not a jury, found the fact of 'necessary for the protection of the public' is in violation of 
Apprendi." Id. at 114, 414 P.3d at 166 (emphasis added; internal 
quotation marks omitted). In other words, because the "required finding exposed the defendant to a greater punishment than that authorized by the jury's verdict[,]" the court in Flubacher held

that the extended term sentence violated Apprendi. Id. at 118Â­
19, 414 P.3d at 170-71 (brackets omitted). Here, at a June 27,
 
2000 sentencing, as set forth in the June 28, 2000 Judgment, a
 judge, not a jury, made the requisite findings in support of
 Elizares's extended term sentence. Therefore, pursuant to
 Flubacher, Elizares's extended term sentence was imposed in an
 illegal manner because it violated Apprendi, 530 U.S. 466 (2000).
 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's July 31, 2017
 
Order Denying Petition and the portion of the Circuit Court's
 June 28, 2000 Judgment in Cr. Nos. 98-0463(2) and 99-0076(2) that
 imposed the extended term sentence are vacated, and this case is
 remanded for further proceedings consistent with Flubacher.
