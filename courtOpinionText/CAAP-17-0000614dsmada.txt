APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 16-1-0384(1))
ORDER GRANTING JANUARY 25, 2018 MOTION TO DISMISS APPELLATE COURT
CASE NUMBER CAAP-17-0000614 FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
Upon review of (1) Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/
Appellee Bank of New York Mellon's (Bank of New York Mellon)
January 25, 2018 motion to dismiss appellate court case number
CAAP-17-0000614 for lack of appellate jurisdiction, (2) the lack
of a memorandum by Defendants/Counterclaim-Plaintiffs/Appellants
Ralph G. Knudsen and Mary Michaele Knudsen (the Knudsens) in
opposition to Bank of New York Mellon's January 25, 2018 motion, NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
and (3) the record, it appears that we lack appellate
jurisdiction over the Knudsens' appeal from the Honorable Rhonda
I.L. Loo's July 20, 2017 interlocutory order denying the
Knudsens' motion for summary judgment in Civil No. 16-1-384(1).
Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 641-1(a) (2016)
authorizes appeals to the Hawai #i Intermediate Court of Appeals
from final judgments, orders, or decrees.  Appeals under 
HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the
rules of court."  HRS § 641-1(c).  Rule 58 of the Hawai #i Rules
of Civil Procedure (HRCP) requires that "[e]very judgment shall
be set forth on a separate document."  The Supreme Court of
Hawai#i has held that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after
the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has
been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties
pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]"  Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming
& Wright, 76 Hawai# i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
"Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not
appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties,
until it has been reduced to a separate judgment."  Carlisle v.
One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai #i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008). 
Consequently, "[a]n appeal from an order that is not reduced to a
judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is
filed in the supreme court will be dismissed."  Jenkins v. Cades
Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai# i at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339
(footnote omitted).
On October 9, 2017, the circuit court clerk filed the
record on appeal for appellate court case number CAAP-17-0000614,
which does not include an appealable judgment.  Rather, the
Knudsens seek to appeal from an order denying summary judgment. 
Although exceptions to the final judgment requirement exist under
the doctrine in Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848) (the Forgay
doctrine), the collateral order doctrine, and HRS § 641-1(b)
(2016), the July 20, 2017 interlocutory order does not satisfy
the requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine, the
collateral order doctrine, or HRS § 641-1(b).  See Ciesla v.
Reddish, 78 Hawai #i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) (regarding
the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay 
-2-NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai #i
319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding the three
requirements for the collateral order doctrine); HRS § 641-1(b)
(regarding the requirements for an appeal from an interlocutory
order).  Absent an appealable judgment, we lack appellate
jurisdiction and the Knudsens' appeal is premature. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Bank of New York
Mellon's January 25, 2018 motion to dismiss this appeal is
granted, and appellate court case number CAAP-17-0000614 is
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai
#i, March 29, 2018.
