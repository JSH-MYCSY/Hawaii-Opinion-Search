OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
L.D., Petitioner-Appellant,
v.
T.G., Respondent-Appellee.
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
(FC-P NO. 12-1-0113K)
ORDER
REGARDING OCTOBER 23, 2017 MOTION
TO DETERMINE APPELLATE JURISDICTION
AND
DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(Nakamura, Chief Judge, Fujise and Chan, JJ.)
Upon review of (1) Petitioner-Appellant L.D.'s
("L.D.")1/ October 23, 2017 motion to determine appellate
jurisdiction, (2) the lack of any response by Respondent-Appellee
T.G. ("T.G.") to L.D.'s October 23, 2017 motion, and (3) the
record, it appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction over
L.D.'s appeal from the Honorable Michelle Kanani Laubach's
March 13, 2017 post-judgment "Court's Decision and Order on
Petitioner's Motion for HFCR 60(b)(6) relief filed December 13,
1/ Because this case involves a controversy regarding the physical
custody of the parties' minor children, we refer to the parties according to
their initials rather than their full names in accordance with Rule 3(c)(1) of
the Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2016" ("the March 13, 2017 post-judgment order") under Hawaii
Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 571-54 (2006), because the March 13,
2017 post-judgment order did not finally determine, and, thus,
end, the post-judgment proceedings on L.D.'s December 13, 2016
post-judgment motion for relief pursuant to Rule 60(b) of the
Hawai#i Family Court Rules ("HFCR"), as HRS § 571-54 requires for
an appealable final post-judgment order.
In family court cases "[a]n interested party aggrieved
by any order or decree of the court may appeal to the
intermediate appellate court for review of questions of law and
fact upon the same terms and conditions as in other cases in the
circuit court[.]"  HRS § 571-54.  In circuit courts, HRS § 641-
1(a) (2016) authorizes appeals from a final judgment, order or
decree.  However, in contrast to civil circuit court cases, civil
family court cases do not necessarily need to reduce dispositive
orders to a separate judgment document for the purpose of
perfecting an aggrieved party's right to appellate review.  See,
e.g., In Interest of Doe, 77 Hawai# i 109, 114 n.9, 883 P.2d 30,
35 n.9 (1994) ("We note that, due to the nature of a 'final'
judgment in child custody cases, the requirements for
appealability set forth in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming &
Wright, 76 Hawai# i 115, 869 P.2d 1334 (Sup.1994), are
inapplicable in such custody cases.").   Under HRS § 571-54,
"appeals in family court cases, as in other civil cases, may be
taken only from (1) a final judgment, order, or decree, . . . or
(2) a certified interlocutory order."  In re Doe , 96 Hawai #i 272,
283, 30 P.3d 878, 889 (2001) (citations omitted).  "Final order
means an order ending the proceedings, leaving nothing further to
be accomplished."  Familian Northwest v. Central Pacific Boiler,
68 Haw. 368, 370, 714 P.2d 936, 937 (1986) (citations and
internal quotation marks omitted).  "However, it is widely
acknowledged that a final judgment or decree is not necessarily
the last decision of a case.  What determines the finality of an
order or decree is the nature and effect of the order or decree."

In re Jane Doe, 77 Hawai #i at 114, 883 P.2d at 35 (citation and
internal quotation marks omitted).
In the instant case, the family court finally
determined and ended the initial proceedings in FC-P 
No. 12-1-0113K on L.D.'s September 24, 2012 petition against T.G.
to establish paternity, child custody, child visitation and child
support pursuant to HRS § 584-14 (2006) with respect to two minor
children when the family court entered an April 30, 2014 final
order, which adjudicated all of the substantive issues by, among
other things, awarding L.D. with sole physical custody of the two
children, as well as monthly child support.  The April 30, 2014
final order was an immediately appealable final order under HRS
§ 571-54.  As an appealable final order under HRS § 571-54, the
April 30, 2014 final order qualified as a "judgment" under HFCR
Rule 54(a), which provides that the term "'[j]udgment' as used in
these rules includes a decree and any order from which an appeal
lies."  However, no party asserted a timely appeal from the
April 30, 2014 final order.
Instead, the parties filed multiple post-judgment
motions, including L.D.'s December 13, 2016 post-judgment HFCR
Rule 60(b) motion for relief from the child support provision in
the April 30, 2014 final order, arguing that T.G. had
fraudulently failed to disclose additional income when the family
court had calculated its award of child support.  In family court
cases, "[a] post-judgment order is an appealable final
order . . . if the order finally determines the post-judgment
proceeding."  Hall v. Hall, 96 Hawai# i 105, 111 n.4, 26 P.3d 594,
600 n.4 (App. 2001) (citation omitted), affirmed in part, and
vacated in part on other grounds, Hall v. Hall, 95 Hawai# i 318,
22 P.3d 965 (2001).  "Correlatively, an order is not final if the
rights of a party involved remain undetermined or if the matter
is retained for further action."  Id. at 157, 80 P.3d at 978. 
Thus, for example, in an appeal from a post-judgment proceeding
in a civil circuit court case, the Supreme Court of Hawai# i held 
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
that an order denying a post-judgment motion to quash a garnishee
summons was not  an appealable post-judgment order because such an
order did not finally determine and end that particular post-
judgment proceeding.  Familian Northwest, Inc. , 68 Haw. at 370,
714 P.2d at 938.
In the instant case, it appears that the March 13, 2017
post-judgment order did not finally determine, and, thus, end,
the post-judgment proceedings on L.D.'s December 13, 2016 post-
judgment HFCR Rule 60(b) motion.  Although the family court
rejected L.D.'s argument that T.G. had fraudulently failed to
disclose additional income when the family court was calculating
the child support award, the family court nevertheless
acknowledged that, through this post-judgment proceeding, the
family court discovered that T.G. had, in fact, inadvertently
failed to disclose additional income to the family court, and,
furthermore, during this post-judgment proceeding, T.G. and L.D.
had recently entered into an new agreement to voluntarily
transfer sole physical custody of one of the two children from
L.D. to T.G.  In light of these newly changed circumstances, the
family court invoked HRS § 571-46 (Supp. 2016) and HRS § 576D-7
(2006) for the express purpose of re-calculating and modifying
the child support award, and the family court ordered T.G. and
L.D. to "file updated financials with proposed child support
guidelines" so that the family court could enter a future post-
judgment order that would provide a modified child support award
in a specific amount.  Consequently, the family court's March 13,
2017 post-judgment order did not finally determine, and, thus,
end, the post-judgment proceedings for L.D.'s December 13, 2016
post-judgment HFCR Rule 60(b) motion.  According to the record on
appeal, the family court has not yet announced its decision on
the exact amount of the modified child support award, much less
entered the written post-judgment order that would effectuate
that decision.  Therefore, the March 13, 2017 post-judgment 
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
order is not an appealable final post-judgment order under HRS 
§ 571-54, but, instead, it is merely one post-judgment order in a
series of post-judgment orders that the family court intends to
utilize for the purpose of finally adjudicating all of the issues
in L.D.'s December 13, 2016 post-judgment HFCR Rule 60(b) motion.
L.D. asserts that the Hawai# i Intermediate Court of
Appeals should temporarily remand this case to the family court
with instructions to enter an appealable final post-judgment
order.  In Waikiki v. Ho# omaka Village Association of Apartment
Owners, 140 Hawai #i 197, 398 P.3d 786 (2017), the Supreme Court
of Hawai #i recently held that, when "[t]he record on appeal
indicates that all claims against all parties have been resolved"
(id. at 204, 398 P.3d at 793), and the only thing lacking for the
perfection of an aggrieved party's right to appeal is the entry
of the final judgment, the Hawai #i Intermediate Court of Appeals
should invoke HRS § 602-57(3) (2016),2/ and temporarily remand
the case to the circuit court with instructions to enter the
judgment.  Waikiki , 140 Hawai #i at 204, 398 P.3d at 793.  See
also, State v. Joshua, No. SCWC-16-0000800, 2017 WL 4586328, at
*1 (Hawai #i October 16, 2017) (footnote omitted).  In both
Waikiki and Joshua, the records on appeal indicated that the
trial courts had already expressed their final decisions either
orally, in court minutes, or in interlocutory orders, and the
2/ Hawaii Revised Statutes § 602-57 (2016) provides:
§ 602-57. Jurisdiction
Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the
intermediate appellate court shall have jurisdiction,
subject to transfer as provided in section 602-58 or review
on application for a writ of certiorari as provided in
section 602-59:
(1) To hear and determine appeals from any court or agency
when appeals are allowed by law;
(2) To entertain, in its discretion, any case submitted
without suit when there is a question of law that could be
the subject of a civil action or proceeding in the circuit
court, or tax appeal court, and the parties agree upon the
facts upon which the controversy depends; and
(3) To make or issue any order or writ necessary or
appropriate in the aid of its jurisdiction, and in such
case, any judge may issue a writ or an order to show cause
returnable before the court.
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
only thing preventing the perfection of the parties' right to
appeal was the entry of an appealable final judgment.
However, the circumstances of the instant case are
distinguishable from the circumstances in Waikiki  and Joshua,
because, in the instant case, the record on appeal does not
indicate that the family court has expressed its final decision
regarding the exact amount of the modified child support award. 
The holdings in Waikiki and Joshua do not apply to the
circumstances of the instant case, and a temporary remand is not
warranted.  Absent an appealable final post-judgment order, we
lack appellate jurisdiction, and L.D.'s appeal is premature.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, that appellate court
case number CAAP-17-0000615 is dismissed for lack of appellate
jurisdiction.
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all other pending
motions in appellate court case number CAAP-17-0000615 are
dismissed as moot.
