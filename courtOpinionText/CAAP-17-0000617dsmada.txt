(3) On August 30, 2017, the appellate clerk notified 
Sistar to pay the filing fee or request a fee waiver by 
September 11, 2017, or the appeal could be dismissed. 
The

been returned;

paid the filing fee or obtained an order allowing her to proceed 
on appeal in forma pauperis, the matter would be brought to the 
court's attention on November 17, 2017, for action that may 
include dismissal of the appeal, and she could seek relief from 
default by motion. The appellate clerk mailed the default notice 
to the address listed in the notice of appeal, and the default 
notice mailed to that address has not been returned; 
(5) Sistar took no further action in this appeal; and

Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed.
