IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
JAMES K. LIBERO, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P. NO. 17-1-0013(2))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Ginoza, C.J., and Reifurth and Chan, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant James K. Libero appeals from the
 
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Judgment Denying
 
Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release
 Petitioner from Custody, filed on August 4, 2017, in the Circuit
 Court of the Second Circuit ("Circuit Court").
1/
 
On appeal, Libero contends that the Circuit Court erred
 
by denying his non-conforming petition to vacate, set aside, or
 correct judgment or to release petitioner from custody
 ("Petition") which requested retesting for deoxyribonucleic acid
 ("DNA") on a kiawe branch used during the assault of a
 complaining witness in Cr. No. 98-0697(2). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Libero's point of error as follows:
 
Libero does not challenge the Circuit Court's findings
 
that he previously requested, and was granted, DNA testing but no
 DNA profile could be identified from the branch. See Findings of
 
Fact Nos. 4 to 7. Therefore, the circuit court properly

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
concluded that the standards under Hawaii Revised Statutes
 
section 844D-123 for post-conviction DNA testing have not been
 met. Specifically, the kiawe branch had previously been
 subjected to DNA testing and Libero does not assert there is an
 analysis that can now resolve an issue not resolved by previous
 analysis. See HRS ยง 844D-123(a)(4) and (b)(3) (2014). Moreover,
 
HRS section 844D-130(a) (2014) states:
Successive motions.  (a) If the defendant has filed a
prior motion for DNA testing under this part or any other
provision of law, the defendant may file, and the court
shall adjudicate, a successive motion or motions under this
part; provided that the defendant asserts new or different
grounds for relief, including but not limited to factual,
scientific, or legal arguments not previously presented, or
the availability of more advanced DNA technology.
 
In the Petition, Libero offers the same basis for
 
relief as he did in his petitions in S.P.P. Nos. 04-1-0008(2),
 
09-1-0030(2), and 13-1-0002(2). Specifically, Libero contends
 that if he used a branch to assault the complaining witness,
 there would have been DNA of the complaining witness or himself
 on the branch, but no DNA profile was obtained or the evidence
 did not prove he was guilty. Libero did not assert a new or
 different ground for relief, thus, the Circuit Court did not err
 by denying the Petition.
 
THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Findings of
 
Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Judgment Denying Petition to
 Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner
 from Custody, filed on August 4, 2017, in the Circuit Court of
 the Second Circuit is affirmed.
