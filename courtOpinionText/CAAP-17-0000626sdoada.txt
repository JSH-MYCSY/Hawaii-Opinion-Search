APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
(S.P.P. NO. 13-1-0006; (CR. NO. 02-1-0026))
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Chan, JJ.)
Petitioner-Appellant Frank Gleich (Gleich), pro se,
appeals from the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit's (circuit
court's) July 28, 2017 "Findings of Fact; Conclusions of Law;
Order Denying Without a Hearing [Gleich's] Rule 40, HRPP,
Amendment to Petition [(10/21/14 Petition)], Filed October 21,
2014."1
Gleich argues the circuit court erred in dismissing his
10/21/14 Petition without a hearing.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
1  The Honorable Randal G.B. Valenciano presided.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Gleich's
points of error as follows.
We decline to review numerous issues on appeal that
Gleich failed to raise in his 10/21/14 Petition.  See Hawai#i
Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(4).
As for the remaining issues, first, Gleich appears to
argue there was insufficient evidence to support his convictions
where the evidence showed the complainant's (Complainant)
virginity was still intact after the alleged incident.  The
circuit court did not err by concluding Gleich failed to raise
this argument in his March 31, 2003 Motion for New Trial or at
sentencing in the underlying case, on direct appeal from his
judgment of conviction, or in his December 3, 2013 Petition to
Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner
from Custody (12/3/13 Petition).  Gleich maintains the omission
was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel; however,
Gleich filed his 12/3/13 Petition as a self-represented litigant.
Gleich has failed to present extraordinary circumstances
justifying his omission.  See Hawai#i Rules of Penal Procedure
(HRPP) Rule 40(a)(3).
Gleich next appears to argue the circuit court erred by
rejecting his argument that the trial court erroneously failed to
instruct the jury on Sexual Assault in the Third Degree (Sex
Assault 3) as a lesser-included offense of Sexual Assault in the
First Degree (Sex Assault 1) and Attempted Sex Assault 1 (Counts
1, 2, 9, 10, and 16-17).   We disagree.2
2  Respondent-Appellee State of Hawai #i originally charged Gleich by
indictment with a total of twenty-one sexual assault charges: a single offense
of Continuous Sexual Assault of a Minor Under Fourteen Years (Continuous Sex
Assault); four counts of Sex Assault 1; six counts of Attempted Sex Assault 1;
and ten counts of Sex Assault 3.  The jury was not instructed on the
Continuous Sex Assault charge in count 1 of the indictment.  The counts were
renumbered so that counts 2-21 in the indictment became counts 1-20, as
follows:
•Counts 1 and 2: Sex Assault 1
•Counts 3-7:  Sex Assault 3
•Count 8:  Attempted Sex Assault 1
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
When Gleich was convicted, in 2003, the prevailing law
in Hawai# i on this point was State v. Haanio, 94 Hawai#i 405, 16
P.3d 246 (2001), overruled by State v. Flores, 131 Hawai# i 43,
314 P.3d 120 (2013).  In Haanio, the Hawai# i Supreme Court held
that a trial court's failure to give lesser-included-offense
instructions to the jury, where appropriate, was harmless if the
jury convicted the defendant of the charged offense or an
included offense greater than the included offense erroneously
omitted from the instructions.  Id. at 415-16, 16 P.3d at 256-57.
In this case, although it is undisputed that the trial court
erroneously failed to instruct the jury on Sex Assault 3 as a
lesser-included offense of Sex Assault 1 and Attempted Sex
Assault 1, as charged in Counts 1, 2, 9, 10, and 16-17, under
Haanio, the error was harmless because the jury found Gleich
guilty of Sex Assault 1 and Attempted Sex Assault 1.  See
Batalona v. Hawai# i, 142 Hawai#i 84, 99, 414 P.3d 136, 151 (2018)
(because Haanio was controlling law when Batalona's counsel
failed to challenge the refusal of a lesser included offense
instruction on appeal, counsel's failure was not ineffective
assistance).  See also State v. Auld, 136 Hawai# i 244, 248, 256-
57, 361 P.3d 471, 475, 483-84 (2015) (affirming conviction based
on charge sufficient under existent case law while announcing new
rule overruling precedent and requiring facts supporting
mandatory minimum term of imprisonment be included in charge to
be applied prospectively only).
Next, Gleich argues that at trial, the Deputy
Prosecuting Attorney committed misconduct by coaching Complainant
to give false testimony before the grand jury to obtain more
•Counts 9-10: Sex Assault 1
•Count 11: Sex Assault 3
•Counts 12-15: Sex Assault 3
•Counts 16-20:  Attempted Sex Assault 1
The jury acquitted Gleich of Counts 18-20, and the trial court instructed the
jury as to Sex Assault 3, as a lesser-included offense of Attempted Sex
Assault 1, as to Count 8.  Gleich was convicted of Counts 1-17.

charges against Gleich.  As the circuit court found, Gleich
raised the argument in his Motion for New Trial, which the court
denied, and on direct appeal, in which the court affirmed the
judgment of conviction.  Thus, the issue has been raised and
ruled upon.  See HRPP Rule 40(g)(2).
Last, Gleich argues that the circuit court erred by
failing to appoint him counsel in the proceedings on his 10/21/14
Petition.  Because, as discussed, Gleich's points lack merit, the
10/21/14 Petition does not raise substantial issues requiring the
marshaling of evidence and logical presentation of evidence.  The
circuit court did not err by denying Gleich's motion for
appointment of counsel.  See Engstrom v. Naauao, 51 Haw. 318,
321, 459 P.2d 376, 378 (1969); see also State v. Levi, 102
Hawai#i 282, 288, 75 P.3d 1173, 1179 (2003).
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Circuit Court
of the Fifth Circuit's July 28, 2017 "Findings of Fact;
Conclusions of Law; Order Denying Without a Hearing [Gleich's]
Rule 40, HRPP, Amendment to Petition, Filed October 21, 2014," is
affirmed.
