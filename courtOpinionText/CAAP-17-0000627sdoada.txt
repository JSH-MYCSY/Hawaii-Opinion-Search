SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Chan, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Timothy Schoenhorn (Schoenhorn),
appeals, pro se, from two judgments (collectively, Judgments):
(1) the August 2, 2017 "Judgment" entered in criminal case 2DCC-
17-0000299, and (2) the August 2, 2017 "Judgment" entered inNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
criminal case 2DCC-17-0000390, in the District Court of the
Second Circuit, Wailuku Division (district court).1
This appeal arises from two charges of illegal camping
under Hawaii Administrative Rules (HAR) § 13-221-15 (effective
1988) brought against Schoenhorn by Plaintiff-Appellee State of
Hawai#i (State) in 2017.  Both cases were consolidated into a
single trial held on August 2, 2017.  At the close of trial, the
district court found Schoenhorn guilty of both charges and
sentenced him to pay a $50.00 fine for each violation.
Schoenhorn timely appealed both cases.2
Schoenhorn raises three points of error: (1) the
evidence was insufficient to show that Schoenhorn was "camping"
as defined by HAR § 13-221-2 (effective 1988, amended 2002);
(2) the prohibition on camping in HAR § 13-221-15, when read in
conjunction with the definition of camping in HAR § 13-221-2, is
unconstitutionally overbroad and vague; and (3) the Department of
Land and Natural Resources (DLNR) officer (the Officer) that
issued the citation violated Schoenhorn's right to privacy.3
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
well as the relevant case law, we resolve Schoenhorn's appeal as
follows: 
1 The Honorable Kelsey T. Kawano presided in both cases. 
2 HAR § 13-221-15 provides:
Camping. No person shall camp or use recreational trailers
or other camper units on the premises, except with the prior
written authorization of the board or its authorized
representative.
3 HAR § 13-221-2 provides in relevant part:
"Camping" means the possession of a backpack, tents,
blankets, tarpaulins, or other obvious camping paraphernalia
any time after one hour after sundown until sunrise on
unencumbered state lands. 
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(1) Schoenhorn's first point of error contends that the
evidence was insufficient to show that Schoenhorn was "camping"
as defined by HAR § 13-221-2.  Specifically, Schoenhorn contends
that at trial the Officer could not identify any specific item
contained in the definition of camping in HAR § 13-221-2 was in
Schoenhorn's possession at the time of the incident.
We review the sufficiency of evidence on appeal as
follows:
Evidence adduced in the trial court must be considered in
the strongest light for the prosecution when the appellate
court passes on the legal sufficiency of such evidence to
support a conviction; the same standard applies whether the
case was before a judge or jury.  The test on appeal is not
whether guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt, but
whether there was substantial evidence to support the
conclusion of the trier of fact.  "Substantial evidence" as
to every material element of the offense charged is credible
evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value
to enable a person of reasonable caution to support a
conclusion.
State v. Kalaola, 124 Hawai #i 43, 49, 237 P.3d 1109, 1115 (2010)
(block quote format altered) (internal citations, brackets, and
quotation marks omitted).
At trial, the Officer testified regarding both
incidents:
[Officer]: Ah, I observed that he was, ah, sleeping with his
(inaudible), ah, (inaudible) a futon mattress.  He had
pillows.  He had blankets.  Um, and, ah, these are all –-
these are all (inaudible) to the rules.  As we call camping
paraphernalia.
The State also entered State's Exhibit 3 which, according to the
Officer who took the picture, accurately represented the
Officer's observations on April 20, 2017, and showed "the
defendant sleeping in the back of the van.  The back hatch is
open.  His pillow, his blanket and his dog."  The State further
entered State's Exhibit 4 which, according to the Officer who
took the picture, accurately represented the Officer's
observations on May 11, 2017, and showed "the defendant in the
back of the van.  Um, it shows the mattress.  It shows a sheet,
blanket and pillow."  On cross-examination, the Officer confirmed
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
that he observed Schoenhorn "wrapped up in what appeared to be a
blanket.  And the actual construction of it, I'm not sure.  But
you were wrapped up in that.  And there very -- there are a lot
of different types of blankets (inaudible) materials.  So you
were wrapped up in that like a blanket."  Schoenhorn did not
present any evidence at trial on the issue, and he confined his
relevant cross-examination exchange to questions regarding the
Officer's definition of a "blanket." 
The evidence presented, consisting of the citing
Officer's testimony and photographs of the scene, was of
sufficient quality to enable a person of reasonable caution to
support a conclusion that Schoenhorn was in possession of, in
fact "wrapped up in," a blanket when he was cited by the Officer.
Accordingly, there was substantial evidence to support the
district court's conclusion that Schoenhorn was "camping" in
violation of HAR § 13-221-15.  Thus, we reject Schoenhorn's first
point of error on appeal as the evidence was sufficient to
support his conviction.
(2) Schoenhorn's second point of error contends that
the prohibition on camping in HAR § 13-221-15, when read in
conjunction with the definition of camping in HAR § 13-221-2, is
unconstitutionally overbroad and vague.  The district court
rejected Schoenhorn's challenge based on the presumption that the
statutes and administrative rules were constitutional.4
4 The trial transcript from August 2, 2017, reads:
The Court: All right. Thank you.
Mr. Schoenhorn, please rise.  I'm ready to make my ruling.
First of all, let me say I appreciate your preparation.  And I
also appreciate your legal argument.
I'm going to presume that the statute and Hawaii Administrative
Rules, our Constitution [sic], and it's going to be your burden should
you proceed to challenge this further, to take it on up.  And you will
bear the burden to convince our appeals court that these are
unconstitutional provisions of law that are being applied as –- as
against you.
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
We review questions of constitutional law de novo under
the "right/wrong" standard and, thus, exercise our "own
independent judgment based on the facts of the case."  State v.
Jenkins, 93 Hawai #i 87, 100, 997 P.2d 13, 26 (2000) (internal
quotation marks and citation omitted).  When reviewing statutes, 
[e]very duly-enacted statute is presumptively
constitutional, and the party challenging the statute must
carry a heavy burden to overcome this presumption.  State v.
Gaylord, 78 Hawai #i 127, 137, 890 P.2d 1167, 1177 (1995).
Whenever possible, a penal statute will be read narrowly and
in such a manner as to preserve the statute's
constitutionality.  Id. at 137–38, 890 P.2d at 1177–78.
State v. Alangcas, 131 Hawai #i 312, 316, 318 P.3d 602, 606 (App.
2013).  We similarly review the constitutionality of an
administrative rule under the same standard "since such rules
have the force and effect of law."  State v. Kirn, 70 Haw. 206,
208, 767 P.2d 1238, 1240 (1989) (citations omitted).
The State contends on appeal that Schoenhorn lacks
standing to allege that the enactments at issue in this case are
constitutionally overbroad and vague.  Regarding the overbreadth
challenge, "[g]enerally, 'one who alleges that a statute is
unconstitutionally overbroad . . . must be directly affected by
the claimed overbroad aspects.'"  State v. Alangcas, 134 Hawai #i
515, 527, 345 P.3d 181, 193 (2015) (quoting Gaylord, 78 Hawai#i
127, 142, 890 P.2d 1167, 1182 (1995)).  However, "[a] court may
also entertain a facial overbreadth challenge when the 'enactment
reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected
conduct.'"  Id. at 194, 345 P.3d at 528 (quoting State v.
Beltran, 116 Hawai# i 146, 152, 172 P.3d 458, 464 (2007)).
Similarly, regarding the vagueness challenge,
In order for a defendant to succeed on an as-applied
challenge, the defendant must demonstrate that the disputed
statute is vague with respect to his or her conduct.  []
However, when a statute burdens a significant constitutional
right, such as the freedom of expression, a defendant whose
rights are not violated may raise the constitutional rights
of others.
Id. at 197, 345 P.3d at 531 (citing Beltran, 116 Hawai #i at 151
n.4, 172 P.3d at 463 n.4.
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
In this case, in light of our conclusion that there was
sufficient evidence adduced at trial that Schoenhorn possessed a
blanket in direct violation of HAR § 13-221-15, there is no
evidence that the claimed overbroad and vague aspects of the
definition of "camping" in HAR § 13-221-2 directly affected
Schoenhorn.  Thus, Schoenhorn's challenge is to these rules on
their face.
The Hawai #i Supreme Court held in Beltran that, in
addition to facial challenges based on the right to the freedom
of expression, a court may entertain a facial overbreadth
challenge if the statute at issue implicates a substantial amount
of constitutionally protected conduct.  116 Hawai#i at 151, 172
P.3d 463; see also Alangcas, 134 Hawai#i at 528, 345 P.3d at 194.
In this case, Schoenhorn contends that the enactments would
inhibit the right to freedom of movement and freedom of
association and could "implicate innocent star gazers or
beachgoers taking an evening stroll for simply possessing a
backpack."  Accordingly, we address Schoenhorn's facial challenge
that HAR § 13-221-15, read in conjunction with the definition of
"camping" in HAR § 13-221-2, is overbroad.
Following the Supreme Court of Hawai #i in Beltran:
in a facial challenge to the overbreadth and vagueness of a
law, a court's first task is to determine whether the
enactment reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally
protected conduct.  In determining whether a substantial
amount of protected activity was affected, a court should
evaluate the ambiguous as well as the unambiguous scope of
the enactment.  To this extent, the vagueness of a law
affects overbreadth analysis.
116 Hawai #i at 152, 172 P.3d at 464  (internal brackets,
quotation marks, and citations omitted).  Thus, we first review
the scope of the enactments in this case to ascertain whether
they impinge upon a substantial amount of constitutionally
protected conduct.
"The fundamental starting point of statutory
interpretation is the language of the statute itself."  Alangcas,
134 Hawai #i at 525, 345 P.3d at 191 (citing Hawaii Gov't Emps.
6NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Ass'n v. Lingle, 124 Hawai #i 197, 202, 239 P.3d 1, 6 (2010)).
"Thus, where the statutory language is unambiguous, our duty is
to give effect to its plain and obvious meaning."  Id.
In the present case, HAR § 13-221-15 unambiguously
prohibits the act of camping without prior written authorization
from DLNR or its authorized representative.  The definition of
"camping" in HAR § 13-221-2 is not internally inconsistent and
describes the prohibited act as the possession of an item from an
enumerated list of items constituting "obvious camping
paraphernalia" from "one hour after sundown until sunrise"
(nighttime) on unencumbered state lands.  On a plain reading, the
enactments are not ambiguous and describe the proscribed conduct
in ordinary and understandable terms.  We construe them to merely
require prior written authorization for, but not to ban, all
nighttime activities by persons in possession of a prohibited
item on unencumbered state lands.  However, such construction,
even when read narrowly, would seemingly require that even "star
gazers or beachgoers taking an evening stroll [while] possessing
a backpack" obtain prior written authorization and so affects the
freedom of movement and freedom of association.5
5[Freedom of movement and freedom of association] are
just as important and vital to our way of life as the rights
or freedoms more specifically enumerated in Sections 3 to 19
in our Bill of Rights, Article I, Constitution of the State of
Hawai[#]i.  Thus, we have no doubt that our State Constitution
does guarantee to the people of Hawai[ #]i the freedom of
movement and freedom of association.
Also, we believe the importance of these fundamental
rights is coming more and more to the foreground in our
modern mobile and fluid society.  Thus, it would be utmost
folly to underestimate the influence of these two freedoms
in our free society.  Freedom would be incomplete if it does
not include the right of men to move from place to place, to
walk in the fields in the country or on the streets of a
city, to stand under open sky in a public park and enjoy the
fresh air, to lie down on a public beach and enjoy a
sunbath, to visit a friend in his home and enjoy an evening
together, and the right to associate with others in the
enjoyment of an avocation or a vocation.
State v. Shigematsu, 52 Haw. 604, 610, 483 P.2d 997, 1000-01 (1971)
(footnotes omitted).
7NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
We next evaluate whether the enactments validly
regulate the ensnared constitutionally protected conduct.  See
Alangcas, 134 Hawai #i at 530, 346 P.3d at 196 (holding that
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707-756 was not overbroad because
the freedom to travel was only limited by the exclusion of "that
agreed upon location and only at that agreed time.").  To
accomplish this, we first review whether the enactments are a
valid exercise of the State's police power and second whether
there exist any constitutional limitations on the exercise of the
police power.  See State v. Sturch, 82 Hawai#i 269, 273, 921 P.2d
1170, 1174 (1996). 
We have previously held, and Schoenhorn does not
challenge on appeal, that the constitutional rights of freedom of
movement and freedom of association exist "subject to the State's
police power to regulate an individual's conduct for the
protection of society."  Sturch, 82 Hawai #i at 273, 921 P.2d at
1174 (citing State v. French, 77 Hawai
#i 222, 231, 883 P.2d 644,
653 (App. 1994)).  "The police power of the State is broad and
extends to the 'preservation of public health, safety, morals or
the general welfare of the public.'"  Id. (brackets omitted)
(quoting State v. Lee, 55 Haw. 505, 513, 523 P.2d 315, 319
(1974)).  "As long as a statute is related to these objectives,
it falls within the scope of the State's police power."  Id.  
In the present case, HAR §§ 13-221-15 & 13-221-2 were
enacted by the Board of Land and Natural Resources (BLNR)
pursuant to authority granted by the Hawai #i State Legislature
via HRS § 171-6 (2011).  The legislature originally enacted the
authorizing statute in 1962 as an "urgency measure deemed
necessary in the public interest" because "a serious question
exist[ed] as to whether or not Hawai[#]i ha[d] any land laws
relating to the management and disposition of the public lands." 
1962 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 32, § 1 at 95.  The Legislature stated,
it was of "immediate importance to the economy and to the people
of Hawai[#]i that we adopt a set of laws for the management and
8NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
disposition of our public lands in accordance with present day
needs."  Id.
In this way, the legislature empowered BLNR to enact
administrative rules to "manage" the public lands to protect the
public health and general welfare of the public as a valid use of
the State's police power.  The authorizing statute placed no
limit on the types of activities or extent of the access that
could be so managed except for an allowance for the "exercise of
native Hawaiian gathering rights and traditional cultural
practices[.]"  HRS § 171-6(15).  Further, HAR § 13-221-1 (1988)
states that the purpose of the enactments at issue in this case
is merely to "control public activities on unencumbered public
lands."  The enactments do not exceed the purpose of the
authorizing statute by purporting to ban the public's access to
unencumbered state lands, rather, the enactments merely provide
that prior written authorization is necessary to camp on
unencumbered state lands.  Thus, we conclude that DLNR's
enactments in this case are a valid exercise of the State's
police power as delegated by the legislature.
We next evaluate whether there exist any constitutional
limitations on the State's exercise of its police power through
the enactments at issue in this case.  In Beltran, the Hawai #i
Supreme Court found a city ordinance was unconstitutionally
overbroad to the extent that it required a permit for activities
defined as camping " regardless of the intent of the participants
or the nature of any other activities in which they may also be
engaging."  116 Hawai#i at 152, 172 P.3d at 464 (emphasis in
original).  According to Beltran, the city ordinance regulated
activity "regardless" of its nature, and by definition included
the regulation of other activities not specifically regulated by
the camping ordinance.  Id.  That is not the case here.  The
enactments in this case only require prior written authorization
for nighttime activities by persons in possession of a prohibited
item on unencumbered state lands.  The same activities carried
9NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
out at other times of day or carried out at nighttime by persons
not possessing a prohibited item are not regulated by the
enactments.  The limitations on the activities which require
prior written authorization distinguish the present case from the
sweeping language contained in the ordinance at issue in Beltran.
Further, and likewise distinguishable from the present
case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
evaluated whether a DLNR permitting enactment which regulated the
commercial conduct of weddings on public beaches was a valid, not
overbroad, regulation of the freedom of expression.  Kaahumanu v.
Hawaii, 682 F.3d 789 (9th Cir. 2012).  In Kaahumanu, the Ninth
Circuit evaluated whether the permit requirements: (1) were
content neutral; (2) were narrowly tailored to serve a
significant government interest; (3) left open ample alternative
channels for exercising the constitutional right; and (4) did not
delegate overly broad licensing authority to a government
official.  Id. at 802-03.
In this case, the enactments: (1) regulate an action
(possession of an enumerated item during the nighttime) without
regard to its purpose; (2) are narrowly tailored to manage only
some types of access to unencumbered state lands; and (3) leave
open ample opportunities for citizens to exercise the freedom of
movement and freedom of association during both the day and the
nighttime without possession of the prohibited items.  Regarding
the fourth element, unlike in Kaahumanu, Schoenhorn's defense
before the district court did not challenge the enactments'
requirement of prior written authorization, thus there was no
opportunity for the state to present evidence, no argument, and
no record on the issue produced by the district court. 
Schoenhorn failed to litigate this element before the district
court, and failed to preserve the issue for appeal.
Thus, we conclude that, while the enactments in this
case do regulate certain instances of movement and association,
such regulation is in accordance with the State's police power. 
10NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
HAR §§ 13-221-15 and 13-221-2 are not unconstitutionally
overbroad because they do not reach a substantial amount of
constitutionally protected conduct.
Finally, because we hold that the enactments are
unambiguous and do not burden the freedom of movement or freedom
of association, and because Schoenhorn does not allege that the
enactments burden any other constitutional rights, Schoenhorn's
facial vagueness challenge likewise fails.  See Alangcas, 134
Hawai#i at 532, 345 P.3d at 198 (refusing to entertain a facial
vagueness challenge where the statute at issue was determined to
not burden the freedom of expression or the freedom of movement
and the defendant did not allege that the vagueness infringed any
other constitutional rights).
(3) Schoenhorn's final point of error contends that the
Officer that issued the citation violated Schoenhorn's right to
privacy when the Officer searched Schoenhorn's vehicle without
probable cause.  Specifically, Schoenhorn contends that the
Officer could not see that Schoenhorn possessed any obvious
camping paraphernalia from the road and lacked a formal complaint
from the public to approach and search Schoenhorn's vehicle.
The Hawai #i Supreme Court has repeatedly held that an
area in which an individual has a reasonable expectation of
privacy is protected by the Fourth Amendment of the United States
Constitution and article I, section 7 of the Hawai#i State
Constitution and the police cannot search that area absent a
warrant.  State v. Wong, 68 Haw. 221, 223, 708 P.2d 825, 828
(1985).  "This expectation of privacy, however, is diminished
with regard to automobiles.  Furthermore, no expectation of
privacy exists when the individual exposes his actions in open
view to the general public."  Id. at 223-24, 708 P.2d at 828
(citations omitted).  In Wong, the Supreme Court held that the
police did not violate Wong's reasonable expectation of privacy
when they observed via binoculars, at night, the contents of
Wong's vehicle which was parked with a door open in a parking lot
11NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
open to the general public.  Id. at 224, 708 P.2d at 828.  In the
present case, the Officer testified that he observed Schoenhorn's
van parked on publicly accessible, unencumbered state lands.  The
Officer stated that the van was parked with its back doors open
near a posting of activities prohibited to the public (including
camping).  The Officer testified that he could clearly see
through the open back doors of the vehicle that Schoenhorn was in
possession of a blanket and sleeping in the back of the open
vehicle.  Accordingly, we conclude that Schoenhorn had no
constitutionally protected expectation of privacy in the present
case and thus the Officer's view of the blanket did not
constitute a search that violated Schoenhorn's right to privacy.
For the foregoing reasons, the August 2, 2017
"Judgment" entered in criminal case 2DCC-17-0000299, and the
August 2, 2017 "Judgment" entered in criminal case 2DCC-17-
