NO. CAAP-17-0000629
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
HOMESTREET BANK, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
CESAR RENOL CABA; EVELYN SAHAGUN CABA,
Defendants-Appellants,
and
 
JOHN DOES 1-50; JANE DOES 1-50; and
DOE ENTITIES 1-50,
Defendants
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 16-1-0571)
 
ORDER
 
(By: Chan, J., for the court1)
 
Pursuant to review of both the record in the Circuit
 
Court of the Second Circuit under Civil No. 16-1-0571 and the
 
Intermediate Court of Appeals under CAAP-17-0000629, it appears
 that:
 
(1) A Notice of Removal of Action Under the Civil Case
 
No. 16-1-0571(2) from the Second Circuit, State of Hawaii to
 Federal Court Based on FRCP 11 & Federal Question Jurisdiction
 Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1441(a) was filed on April 16, 2018 in the
 Circuit Court of the Second Circuit;
 
(2) Defendant Evelyn Sahagun Caba's Notice of Filing of
 
1
 Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leondard and Chan, J.J.
 Voluntary Petition Under Chapter 13 and of the Automatic Stay,
 
was filed on June 6, 2018 in the Circuit Court of the Second
 Circuit;
 
(3) On June 7, 2018, this court entered a Summary
 
Disposition Order;
 
(4) On July 2, 2018, the plaintiff-appellee filed,
 
under CAAP-17-0000629, a letter addressed to The Honorable
 Kenneth J. Mansfield;
 
(5) On July 3, 2018, this court entered Judgment;
 (6) The filing of a bankruptcy petition stays the
 
"commencement or continuation . . . of a judicial . . .
 proceeding against the [bankruptcy] debtor" during the pendency
 of the bankruptcy case. 11 U.S.C. ยง 362(a)(1). It also operates
 as an automatic stay of "any act to obtain possession of property
 of the estate or of property from the estate or to exercise
 control over property of the estate[.]" 11 U.S.C. ยง 362(a)(3). 
The filing of the petition triggers the automatic stay,
 notwithstanding the lack of actual notice of commencement of
 proceedings. In re Sumpter, 171 B.R. 835, 841-42 (Bankr. N.D.
 
Ill. 1994).
 
(7) This court did not receive appropriate notice of 
defendant-appellant's bankruptcy. Nevertheless, the Summary Disposition Order and the Judgment are void. See Island Ins. 
Co., Inc. V. Santos, 86 Hawai' i 363, 366, 949 P.2d 203, 206 (App. 
1997) (holding that actions taken in violation of the automatic stay are void and without effect, even if the entity that violated the stay had no knowledge or notice of the filing of the bankruptcy petition or of the automatic stay, although the bankruptcy court could retroactively annul the stay and validate actions that violated the stay); Wagner v. World Botanical Gardens, Inc., 126 Hawai' i 190, 195, 268 P.3d 443, 448 (App. 
2011) ("A judgment is void only if the court that rendered it lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter, or of the parties, or if it acted in a manner inconsistent with due process of law." (citation and internal quotation marks omitted.)).

 Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the June 7, 2018
 
Summary Disposition Order and the July 3, 2018 Judgment are
 
vacated.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the parties jointly or
 
severally shall file, in this court under CAAP-17-0000629,
 certified copies of the appropriate bankruptcy court document(s)
 indicating the automatic stay has been vacated, modified, lifted,
 or terminated. Failure to timely comply with this order may
 result in sanctions.
