NOEL MADAMBA CONTRACTING, LLC,
Movant/Cross-Respondent-Appellee,
v.
RAMON ROMERO and CASSIE ROMERO,
Respondents/Cross-Petitioners-Appellants,
and
A&B GREEN BUILDING, LLC,
Cross-Respondent-Appellee.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(S.P. NO. 12-1-0210)
ORDER GRANTING THE TWO JANUARY 8, 2018
MOTIONS TO DISMISS THE APPEAL AND
DISMISSING AS MOOT ALL OTHER PENDING MOTIONS
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
Upon consideration of (1) Petitioner/Cross-Respondent/
Appellee Noel Madamba Contracting, LLC's (Madamba Contracting),
two January 8, 2018 motions to dismiss this appeal,
(2) Respondents/Cross-Petitioners/Appellants Ramon Romero's and
Cassie Romero's (the Romeros) two January 16, 2018 memoranda in
opposition to Madamba Contracting's two motions to dismiss this
appeal, and (3) the record, it appears that, although Madamba
Contracting's arguments for dismissal lack merit, we lack
jurisdiction over the Romeros' appeal from the following two
judgments that the Honorable Rhonda A. Nishimura certified for
appeal pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Hawai# i Rules of Civil NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Procedure (HRCP) in circuit court special proceeding 
S.P. No. 12-1-0210 (RAN) regarding an arbitration pursuant to
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) Chapter 658A:
(1) an August 3, 2017 HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified
judgment on a June 8, 2017 interlocutory order
repeating the Supreme Court of Hawai #i's award of
attorneys' fees and costs from a prior appeal; and
(2) an August 3, 2017 HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified
judgment on a June 8, 2017 interlocutory order
directing the return of garnished funds.
In the underlying case, the circuit court had
previously entered an August 27, 2012 order confirming an
arbitration award in favor of the Romeros and a September 20,
2012 judgment on that arbitration award, both of which Madamba
Contracting appealed pursuant to subsections (3) and (6) of 
HRS § 658A-28(a) (2016):
§ 658A-28. Appeals.
(a)  An appeal may be taken from:  
(1) An order denying a motion to compel arbitration;  
(2) An order granting a motion to stay arbitration;  
(3) An order confirming  or denying confirmation of an
award;  
(4) An order modifying or correcting an award;  
(5) An order vacating an award without directing a
rehearing; or  
(6) A final judgment entered pursuant to this chapter. 
(b)  An appeal under this section shall be taken as from an
order or a judgment in a civil action.
(Emphases added).  However, the Supreme Court of Hawai #i vacated,
among other things, the August 27, 2012 order confirming the
arbitration award and the September 20, 2012 judgment, and
remanded the case for the purpose of conducting a new arbitration
before a different arbitrator.  Noel Madamba Contracting LLC v.
Romero, 137 Hawai# i 1, 16-17, 364 P.3d 518, 533-34 (2015).  On
May 10, 2016, the Supreme Court of Hawai #i additionally awarded
attorneys' fees and costs incurred in the appellate proceedings
to Madamba Contracting.  The parties have not yet obtained a new
arbitration decision before a new arbitrator.  Consequently, the
record on appeal does not yet contain a final judgment or order
that is appealable pursuant to HRS § 658A-28(a).
-2-NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
After the prior appeal concluded, Madamba Contracting
filed several motions during the remand proceedings, and the
circuit court entered two resulting orders relevant to this
appeal: (1) a June 8, 2017 order that repeated the Supreme Court
of Hawai# i's award of attorneys' fees and costs incurred in the
prior appeal, and (2) a June 8, 2017 order directing the 
Romeros to return garnished funds to Madamba Contracting. 
Although each order did not resolve a substantive cause of
action, the circuit court certified them for appeal pursuant to
HRCP Rule 54(b) and entered the two corresponding August 3, 2017
HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified judgments.  On September 5, 2017, 
the Romeros filed a notice of appeal from the two August 3, 2017
HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified judgments.
The two August 3, 2017 HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified
judgments do not qualify as appealable judgments under HRS
§ 658A-28(a).  Nevertheless, HRS § 658A-28 provides a "non-
exclusive list" of appealable circuit court orders from an
arbitration matter that does not preclude other orders from being
appealable by way of other statutes, such as HRS § 641-1.  County
of Hawai# i v. Unidev, LLC, 129 Hawai# i 378, 389-93, 301 P.3d 588,
599-603 (2013). 
HRS § 641-1(a) normally requires a final judgment for
appealability, and that judgment must, " on its face , either
resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding
necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)."  Jenkins v.
Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai #i 115, 119, 869 P.2d
1334, 1338 (1994) (original emphasis).  This
rule in Jenkins - to wit, that circuit court orders
resolving claims against parties must generally be reduced
to a judgment and the judgment must be entered in favor of
or against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP Rule 58
before an appeal may be taken - is limited to circuit court
orders disposing of claims raised in a circuit court
complaint.
Ditto v. McCurdy , 103 Hawai# i 153, 159, 80 P.3d 974, 980 (2003)
(emphasis in original).  For the purpose of perfecting a party's
right to appeal pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a), HRCP Rule 54(b) 
-3-NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
authorizes a circuit court to certify a judgment as to one or
more but fewer than all claims or parties, but
the power of a lower court to enter a certification of
finality is limited to only those cases where (1) more than
one claim for relief is presented or multiple parties (at
least three) are involved, . . . and (2) the judgment
entered completely disposes of at least one claim or all of
the claims by or against at least one party.
Elliot Megdal & Associates v. Daio USA Corp. , 87 Hawai #i 129,
133, 952 P.2d 886, 890 (App. 1998) (citations omitted; emphasis
added).  An HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified judgment "must be a
'judgment' in the sense that it is a decision upon a cognizable
claim for relief, and it must be 'final' in the sense that it is
an ultimate disposition of an individual claim  entered in the
court of a multiple claims action."  Elliot Megdal, 87 Hawai# i at
135, 952 P.2d at 892 (citation and some internal quotation marks
omitted; emphases added) (dismissing for lack of jurisdiction an
appeal from an HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified judgment on an order
that did not fully adjudicate a party's cause of action).
For example, prior to the entry of a final judgment, a
"circuit court's order awarding attorneys' fees and costs may not
be certified as a final judgment, pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b),
because such an order is not a final decision with respect to a
claim for relief."  Fujimoto v. Au , 95 Hawai #i 116, 136 n.16, 
19 P.3d 699, 719 n.16 (2001) (citation and internal quotation
marks omitted).  "The entry of judgment and taxation of costs are
separate legal acts."  CRSC, Inc. v. Sage Diamond Co., Inc. , 
95 Hawai #i 301, 307, 22 P.3d 97, 103 (App. 2001) (citation,
internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).  "Absent entry of
an appealable final judgment on the claims . . . [to which an
award of attorneys' fees and costs relates], the award of
attorneys' fees and costs is . . . not appealable."  Fujimoto , 
95 Hawai# i at 123, 19 P.3d at 706; CRSC, Inc. , 95 Hawai #i at 306,
22 P.3d at 102 ("Similarly, the September 23, 1999 Order
[awarding only attorneys' fees] and the February 3, 2000 Judgment
[awarding only attorneys' fees] are not appealable, and we do not
have appellate jurisdiction to review them.").
-4-NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Absent a final circuit court judgment, the proper way
for a circuit court to authorize appellate review of an
interlocutory order awarding attorneys' fees and costs would be
to grant leave to assert an interlocutory appeal pursuant to HRS
§ 641-1(b) (2016), which the circuit court did not do.1  Given
that the Supreme Court of Hawai #i vacated the circuit court's
August 27, 2012 order confirming the arbitration award and the
September 20, 2012 judgment in the prior appeal, the circuit
court erred on remand by attempting to reduce the June 8, 2017
order repeating the Supreme Court of Hawaii's prior award of
attorneys' fees and costs to the corresponding August 3, 2017
HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified judgment, because that ruling was not a
final circuit court decision with respect to a party's cause of
action.  See Fujimoto , 95 Hawai #i at 136 n.16, 19 P.3d at 719
n.16.
Similarly, the June 8, 2017 order directing the return
of garnished funds was not a final decision with respect to a
party's cause of action, and, thus, the circuit court likewise
erred by attempting to reduce this interlocutory order to an
August 3, 2017 HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified judgment.  Consequently,
we lack appellate jurisdiction over the Romeros' appeal, which is
premature.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Madamba
Contracting's two January 8, 2018 motions to dismiss the Romeros'
appeal are granted, albeit for reasons other than Madamba
1HRS § 641-1(b) (2016) provides:
(b) Upon application made within the time provided
by the rules of court, an appeal in a civil matter may
be allowed by a circuit court in its discretion from an
order denying a motion to dismiss or from any
interlocutory judgment, order, or decree whenever the
circuit court may think the same advisable for the
speedy termination of litigation before it.  The
refusal of the circuit court to allow an appeal from an
interlocutory judgment, order, or decree shall not be
reviewable by any other court.
(Emphases added). 
-5-NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Contracting's arguments for dismissal, and the appeal is
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all other pending
motions in CAAP-17-0000646 are dismissed as moot.
