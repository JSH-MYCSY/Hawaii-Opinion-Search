IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
FOE LIULAMA, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Defendant-Appellee,
and JOHN DOES 1-5, Defendants 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 17-1-0391) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By:  Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Chan, JJ.) 
Plaintiff-Appellant Foe Liulama (Liulama) appeals from 
the Circuit Court of the First Circuit's (Circuit Court)1 
May 14, 2018 Judgment in favor of Defendant-Appellee State of 
Hawai# i (State) and against Liulama entered on the Order Granting 
Defendant State of Hawai# i's Motion to Dismiss First Amended 
Complaint for Negligence. 
Liulama essentially argues that the Circuit Court 
erroneously dismissed the First Amended Complaint (FAC) as 
untimely.  The State concedes. 
Upon review of the record on appeal and relevant legal 
authorities, giving due consideration to the issues raised and 
arguments advanced by the parties, we resolve Liulama's appeal as 
follows, vacate the Judgment and remand for further proceedings. 
1 The Honorable Keith K. Hiraoka presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Liulama was incarcerated by the State and was allegedly 
negligently held thirty-six days past his correctly-calculated 
release date. 
Liulama was allowed to join, on April 10, 2009, as a 
plaintiff with several other inmates, almost all of whom had 
claims under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 706-668.5 (2014 & 
Supp. 2015), in a civil rights lawsuit against two State 
corrections officials pending in the United States District Court 
for the District of Hawai# i (USDC).  
Alston v. Read, 1:07-CV-
0266-SPK-LEK.  Ultimately, the federal court dismissed the federal court claims against the officials based on qualified 
immunity, Alston v. Read, 663 F.3d 1094, 1100 (9th Cir. 2011), 
declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs' 
state law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c) ("The district 
courts may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a 
claim [] if . . . (3) the district court has dismissed all claims 
over which it has original jurisdiction[.]"), and remanded the 
actions that were removed from state court.
2  On March 8, 2017, 
Liulama, who had not previously filed his claims in state court, filed a complaint in Circuit Court, followed by the FAC on 
March 21, 2017, alleging negligence on the part of the State. 
Liulama v. State of 
Hawai# i, Civ. No. 17-1-0391. 
Noting that there were no published Hawai# i appellate 
decisions applying § 1367(d), the Circuit Court chose the 
"extension/grace period" approach, City of Los Angeles v. County 
of Kern, 328 P.3d 56 (Cal. 2014), abrogated by Artis v. D.C., 138 
S. Ct. 594 (2018), calculating that, since Liulama's two-year 
limitations period would have expired during the pendency of the 
federal court proceedings, the deadline for filing his state 
court lawsuit was April 8, 2016.  Since Liulama did not file his 
complaint until March 8, 2017, the Circuit Court dismissed his 
case. 
2 We take judicial notice of the March 9, 2016 Order Granting
Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Federal Claims and Remanding State Law Claims
filed in the USDC in Alston v. Read, CV No. 07-00266. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Following the Circuit Court's dismissal, the United 
States Supreme Court held that § 1367(d)'s directive to "'toll' a 
state limitations period means to hold it in abeyance, i.e., to 
stop the clock."  Artis, 138 S. Ct. at 598.  Therefore, Liulama 
had 491 days remaining until the two-year statute of limitations 
period expired,3 plus an additional thirty days under § 1367(d), 
to commence the Circuit Court action.  Pursuant to Artis, then, Liulama had until August 12, 2017, not April 8, 2016, to file his 
Circuit Court complaint, rendering his March 8, 2017 filing 
timely. 
Based on our resolution of this issue, it is 
unnecessary to decide Liulama's remaining points on appeal. 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the May 14, 2018 
Judgment and remand this case for further proceedings. 
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, October 24, 2019.

3 The FAC alleges that the State's negligence began August 14, 2008;
239 days later (April 10, 2009) Liulama joined the Alston matter, during which
time the two-year limitations period was "suspended" under § 1367(d).  Seven hundred and thirty days (two years), minus 239 days, is 491 days.
