ANTHONY P. LOCRICCHIO,
Non-Party/Appellant.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 1RC16-1-1982)
ORDER GRANTING THE NOVEMBER 16, 2017
MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL AND
DISMISSING AS MOOT ALL OTHER PENDING MOTIONS
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
Upon consideration of Plaintiff-Appellee Charles
Huang's (Huang) November 16, 2017 motion to dismiss the appeal,
the record, and there being no opposition, it appears that we
lack appellate jurisdiction over Non-Party/Appellant 
Anthony P. Locricchio's (Locricchio) appeal from the Honorable
Hilary B. Gangnes's August 3, 2017 order striking Locricchio's
motion to disqualify the Honorable Michael Tanigawa from the
underlying district court case, Civil No. 1RC16-1-1982.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Locricchio is a non-party who lacks standing to obtain
appellate review of the August 3, 2017 order.
The issue of standing implicates this court's
jurisdiction, and, therefore, must be addressed first.
Because standing is a jurisdictional issue that may be
addressed at any stage of a case, an appellate court has
jurisdiction to resolve questions regarding standing, even
if that determination ultimately precludes jurisdiction over
the merits.

419, 427-28, 134 P.3d 585, 593-94 (2006) (citation and footnote
omitted).
Generally, the requirements of standing to appeal are: (1)
the person must first have been a party to the action; (2)
the person seeking modification of the order or judgment
must have had standing to oppose it in the trial court; and
(3) such person must be aggrieved by the ruling, i.e., the
person must be one who is affected or prejudiced by the
appealable order.
Abaya v. Mantell, 112 Hawai# i 176, 181, 145 P.3d 719, 724 (2006)
(citation omitted; emphasis in original).  "In other words, non-
parties, who did not or could not intervene, are ordinarily
denied standing to appeal."  Id. (citation and internal quotation
marks omitted).  For example, in Abaya, the Supreme Court of
Hawai#i dismissed the appeal because the appellant did not
formally intervene pursuant to Rule 24 of the Hawai #i Rules of
Civil Procedure, and, therefore, was not made a party to the
case, and lacked standing to appeal.  Id. at 184, 145 P.3d at
727.  
Here, Locricchio is not a party in the instant case,
and he has not formally intervened pursuant to Rule 24 of the
District Court Rules of Civil Procedure.  Locricchio initially
represented Defendant-Appellee David Douglas Kromer, Trustee, MPI
Ltd. Trust, in this case, but the Supreme Court of Hawai #i
entered an order on October 18, 2016 in SCAD-16-0000218
disbarring Locricchio.  Under HRS ยง 605-2 (2016) and HRS ยง 605-14
(2016), non-attorneys such as Locricchio "are not permitted to
act as attorneys and represent other natural persons in their
causes."  Oahu Plumbing & Sheet Metal, Ltd. v. Kona Constr.,
Inc.

-2-NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
footnote omitted).  As a non-party in this case, Locricchio lacks
standing to obtain appellate review.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Huang's
November 16, 2017 motion to dismiss the appeal is granted, and
the appeal is dismissed.
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all other pending
motions are dismissed as moot. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, January 22, 2018.
