APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(HONOLULU DIVISION)
(CASE NO. 1DTA-15-05236)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER

Plea/Judgment, filed on July 5, 2017 (Judgment ), in the District

Luster was convicted of Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence

(HRS) ยง 291E-61(a)(1) (Supp. 2017).2

2 HRS ยง 291E-61(a) states:

On appeal, Luster raises one point of error, contending
that the District Court erred by denying his June 20, 2017 motion
to suppress because he was not advised of his Miranda rights and
did not waive his Miranda  rights while being subjected to
custodial interrogation during a traffic stop.  Luster also
submits that, without the improperly introduced evidence, there
was no substantial evidence to support his conviction.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve Luster's point of error as follows:
Luster claims that Officer Arthur Gazelle's ( Officer
Gazelle) observations of Luster's performance on the field
sobriety tests, as a non-verbal communication, should have been
suppressed.  Luster does not dispute, however, that he was
initially pulled over pursuant to a valid traffic stop after
Sergeant Zane Hamrick (Sergeant Hamrick ) observed Luster
operating his vehicle at night without headlights, crossing
broken white lines unsafely, and executing an improper left
turn.3  
2(...continued)
(1) While under the influence of alcohol in an
amount sufficient to impair the person's normal
mental faculties or ability to care for the
person and guard against casualty; . . .
3Luster cites State v. Tsujimura, 140 Hawai #i 299, 400 P.3d 500
(2017), for the proposition that his post-seizure statements and non-verbal
communicative responses were obtained in violation of his right to remain
silent.  In Tsujimura, the supreme court held that a person has the right to
remain silent before an arrest is made.  Id. at 310-11, 400 P.3d at 511-12. 
Tsujimura, however, is distinguishable because, in that case, the issue was
whether the defendant's pre-arrest silence could be used against him
substantively as an implication of guilt, not whether non-custodial, pre-

A defendant is not in custody for purposes of Miranda
merely because he or she has been pulled over pursuant to a valid
traffic stop.  State v. Kaleohano, 99 Hawai# i 370, 376, 56 P.3d
138, 144 (2002).  Here, Luster was not in custody merely by
virtue of being pulled over during a traffic stop.  Although
Luster was asked to exit his vehicle, Luster was not subjected to
custodial interrogation prior to or while performing the
standardized field sobriety tests; therefore, he was not required
to be advised of his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S.
436 (1966), based on these circumstances alone. 
In addition, Sergeant Hamrick had specific articulable
facts to warrant asking Officer Gazelle to administer the field
sobriety test to Luster.  Luster admits that he consented to
participate in the field sobriety tests when asked.  Under the
totality of the circumstances, we conclude that Luster was not in
custody based on the time, place, and length of the
interrogation, the nature of the questions asked, and the conduct
of the police at the time of the interrogation because he
consented to participate in the field sobriety tests.  See State
v. Kazanas, 138 Hawai# i 23, 35-36, 375 P.3d 1261, 1273-74
(2016).4  
3(...continued)
arrest non-verbal communications made by a defendant can be used as evidence. 
Id. at 311-14, 400 P.3d at 512-15.
4Similarly, in order for a defendant's statements to be admitted
into evidence, it need not be shown that a defendant was advised of his or her
rights, if the defendant's statements are not the product of custodial
interrogation.  Kaleohano , 99 Hawai #i at 377-78, 56 P.3d at 145-46.  As stated
above, Luster was not in custody and, thus, he was not subjected to custodial
interrogation which required advisement of his Miranda rights.  Accordingly,
his further argument that his physical performance on the field sobriety test
must be suppressed, as the "fruit of the poisonous tree" of a prior illegal

3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Admission of Luster's performance on the standardized
field sobriety tests does not violate his right against self-
incrimination.  The right against self-incrimination is not
necessarily implicated whenever a person suspected of criminal
activity is compelled in some way to cooperate in developing
evidence which may be used against him or her.  State v. Wyatt,
67 Haw. 293, 302, 687 P.2d 544, 551 (1984).  In Wyatt, the court
stated that observations of a defendant's performance on field
sobriety tests was an exhibition of physical characteristics of
coordination.  Id. at 303, 687 P.2d at 551.  Thus, the Wyatt
court held that since the performance on field sobriety tests was
not communication nor testimony, the trial court did not err by
refusing to suppress the field sobriety test observations.  Id.
at 301-03, 687 P.2d at 550-51.  Luster makes no attempt to
distinguish Wyatt.  For these reasons, we conclude that Luster's
point of error is without merit.
Luster also contends that, absent the erroneously
admitted observations of his performance on the standardized
field sobriety tests, there was not substantial evidence to
support his conviction.  However, as we have concluded that the
District Court did not err by refusing to suppress observations
of Luster's actions, we conclude that this argument is without
merit.

custodial interrogation by the officers, is without merit.
