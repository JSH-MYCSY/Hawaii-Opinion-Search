APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 12-1-0458(1))
ORDER GRANTING SEPTEMBER 20, 2017 MOTION TO
DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
AND
DISMISSING AS MOOT ALL OTHER PENDING MOTIONS
IN APPELLATE COURT CASE NUMBER CAAP-17-0000666  
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Fujise and Chan, JJ.)
Upon review of (1) Defendant/Cross-Claim Plaintiff/
Appellee Sabio Reinhardt's ("Reinhardt") September 20, 2017
motion to dismiss appellate court case number CAAP-17-0000666 for
lack of appellate jurisdiction, (2) the lack of any memorandum by
Plaintiffs-Appellants Kawika Franco, Estate of Tiare Franco, NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Peaches Kong, Apples Eleban, Lovely Franco, Taua Gleason,
Kolomana Kong Kaniaupio Gleason, Kaulana Kong Kaniaupio Gleason,
Cheryl Russell, and Jeanne Russell ("the Appellants") in response
to Reinhardt's September 20, 2017 motion, and (3) the record on
appeal that the circuit court clerk filed on November 8, 2017, it
appears that the circuit court has set aside the final judgment
in this case, and, consequently, we lack appellate jurisdiction
over the Appellants' appeal from the following two interlocutory
orders that the Honorable Rhonda I.L. Loo filed in Civil 
No. 12-1-0458(1):
(1) the September 6, 2017 "Order Granting Defendant
Sabio Reinhardt's Motion to Set Aside Final
Judgment Filed on May 18, 2016 and Order Granting
Plaintiffs' Motion for Taxation of Costs and Pre-
Judgment Interest Filed on July 28, 2016 and for
New Trial Filed on May 16, 2017" (hereinafter "the
September 6, 2017 order setting aside judgment and
granting a new trial"); and
(2) the September 6, 2017 "Order Denying Plaintiffs'
Motion to Disqualify Counsel Filed on June 15,
2017" (hereinafter "the September 6, 2017 order
denying the motion to disqualify counsel").
We initially note that
[j]urisdiction is the base requirement for any court
resolving a dispute because without jurisdiction, the court
has no authority to consider the case. . . .  With regard to
appeals, the remedy by appeal is not a common law right and
exists only by virtue of statutory or constitutional
provision. . . .  Therefore, the right of appeal is limited
as provided by the legislature and compliance with the
methods and procedure prescribed by it is obligatory.
Korean Buddhist Dae Won Sa Temple of Hawaii v. Concerned #
Citizens of Pâ lolo, 107 Hawai #i 371, 380, 114 P.3d 113, 124
(2005) (citations, internal quotation marks and brackets
omitted).  Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 641-1(a) (2016) is
the primary statutory authority for appeals from civil circuit
court final judgments, orders, or decrees.  Appeals under HRS
§ 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules
of court."  HRS § 641-1(c).  Rule 58 of the Hawai# i Rules of
Civil Procedure (HRCP) requires that "[e]very judgment shall be
set forth on a separate document."  HRCP Rule 58.  Based on this 
-2-NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
requirement under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawaii has
held that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders
have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered
in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to
HRCP [Rule] 58[.]"  Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright , 76
Hawai#i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994).#
The circuit court's May 18, 2016 final judgment
resolved all claims as to all parties by entering judgment in
favor of the Appellants and against Reinhardt as to the
Appellants' cause of action for negligence, and expressly
dismissing any and all remaining claims.  Therefore, the May 18,
2016 final judgment was initially an appealable final judgment
pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a), HRCP Rule 58 and the holding in
Jenkins.  However, no party asserted a timely appeal from the
May 18, 2017 final judgment.
Instead, the Appellants seek appellate review of the
following two post-judgment orders: (1) the September 6, 2017
order setting aside judgment and granting a new trial, and
(2) the September 6, 2017 denying the motion to disqualify
counsel.  Granted, when the record contains a valid, appealable
final judgment, a "post-judgment order is an appealable final
order under HRS § 641-1(a) if the order ends the proceedings,
leaving nothing further to be accomplished."  Ditto v. McCurdy,
103 Hawai #i 153, 157, 80 P.3d 974, 978 (2003) (citation omitted). 
"[T]he separate judgment requirement articulated in Jenkins  is
inapposite in the post-judgment context."  Id. at 158, 80 P.3d at
979.
Clearly, the rule in Jenkins – to wit, that circuit court
orders resolving claims against parties must generally be
reduced to a judgment and the judgment must be entered in
favor of or against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP
Rule 58 before an appeal may be taken – is limited to
circuit court orders disposing of claims raised in a circuit
court complaint.
Id. at 159, 80 P.3d at 980.  "Accordingly, the time for appealing
the matters conclusively decided by the . . . [post-judgment]
order commenced upon entry thereof, not upon entry of the 
-3-NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
superfluous . . . judgment on the [post-judgment] order."  Id. at
159-60, 80 P.3d at 980-81.  For example, "[a]n order denying a
motion for post-judgment relief under HRCP [Rule] 60(b) is an
appealable final order under HRS § 641-1(a)."  Id.  at 160, 80
P.3d at 981.  
"Correlatively, an order is not final if the rights of
a party involved remain undetermined or if the matter is retained
for further action."  Ditto, 103 Hawai# i at 157, 80 P.3d at 978. 
Thus, for example, in an appeal from a post-judgment proceeding
in a civil circuit court case, the Supreme Court of Hawai# i held
that an order denying a post-judgment motion to quash a garnishee
summons was not  an appealable post-judgment order because such an
order did not finally determine and end that particular post-
judgment proceeding:
In this case, the circuit court's denial of
Garnishees' motion to quash the garnishee summons is not a
final order, but simply an interlocutory step in the
garnishment process.  It did not terminate the garnishment
proceedings.  Nor did it finally adjudicate the rights of
any party.  To the contrary, the order perpetuated the
proceedings.  It determined that the summons was properly
issued which enabled the proceedings to continue.
Consequently, the order left pending several issues
regarding the ultimate fate of the preserved funds.  Further
proceedings are needed to determine whether Garnishees have
a right to setoff; whether there are conflicting claims to
the funds; and whether the funds may be applied to satisfy
the underlying judgment.  These determinations were to be
made at the garnishee proof hearing which was scheduled, but
never heard.
This appeal is premature and we dismiss for lack of
jurisdiction.  
Familian Northwest, Inc. v. Central Pacific Boiler & Piping,
Ltd., 68 Haw. 368, 370, 714 P.2d 936, 938 (1986) (footnote
omitted).
As already stated, "[a]n order denying a motion for
post-judgment relief under HRCP [Rule] 60(b) is an appealable
final order under HRS § 641-1(a)."  Ditto, 103 Hawai #i at 160, 80
P.3d at 981 (citation omitted).  But, that is because, under
those circumstances, the record contains a valid judgment through 
-4-NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
which the circuit court resolved all claims as to all parties,
and the post-judgment order denying the motion for post-judgment
relief under HRCP Rule 60(b) has finally determined all of the
issues in the post-judgment proceeding, leaving nothing further
to be accomplished.  In contrast, however, "[w]hen, as in most
cases, an order granting a Rule 60(b) motion merely vacates the
judgment and leaves the case pending for further determination,
the order is akin to an order granting a new trial and, in most
instances, is interlocutory and nonappealable."  12 James Wm.
Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice  § 60.68[2], at 60-233 (3d
ed. 2017) (footnote omitted).  In other words, "[a]n order
granting a motion under Rule 60(b) and ordering a new trial is
purely interlocutory and not appealable, although on appeal from
a judgment entered after the new trial the appellate court will
review whether it was error to have reopened the first judgment." 
11 Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and
Procedure § 2871 at 589-90 (3d ed. 2012 & Supp. 2016) (footnotes
omitted).  Although Moore's Federal Practice  and Federal Practice
and Procedure analyze Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure (FRCP), the Supreme Court of Hawai #i has noted that it
patterned HRCP Rule 60(b) after FRCP Rule 60(b), "and where we
have patterned a rule within the HRCP after an equivalent rule
within the FRCP, interpretations of the rule by the federal
courts are deemed to be highly persuasive in the reasoning of
this court."  Kawamata Farms, Inc. v. United Agri Products , 86
Hawai#i 214, 255, 948 P.2d 1055, 1096 (1997).
Thus, for example, under analogous circumstances
involving post-judgment relief under HRCP Rule 59 rather than
HRCP Rule 60(b), "[a]fter judgment for plaintiffs pursuant to a
jury verdict, [and] defendants were granted a new trial, and
plaintiffs appealed[,]" the Supreme Court of Hawai #i dismissed
the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction because the case
was, in effect, still pending before the circuit court and
"[t]here was no application for or allowance of the appeal by the 
-5-NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
court below."  Morneau v. Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, 48 Haw.
534, 534, 404 P.2d 899, 899 (1965) (footnote omitted).
[W]hen a motion for new trial is filed there is no
opportunity to appeal unless the outcome is a denial of the
motion with the consequent reaffirmation of the judgment,
whereupon the appeal lies from the judgment.  If a new trial
is granted and the judgment consequently is set aside there
is no final judgment from which to appeal.  6 Moore, Federal
Practice, § 59.15(1), at 3896 (2d ed.).
Id. at 536, 404 P.2d at 900 (emphasis added; footnote omitted). 
"[T]he grant of a new trial does not [automatically substitute a
new judgment], and hence is not appealable as of right."  Id.  
"[U]nder the Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure, an order granting a
new trial is deemed interlocutory[.]"  Id.  at 536 n.3, 404 P.2d
at 900 n.3.  In response to an argument that the circuit court
had erred by entering the order setting aside the judgment and
granting a new trial, the Morneau  court explained that, "[w]hen
and if the order for new trial comes before us for review [by way
of a timely appeal from a future amended judgment,] we will have
occasion to consider such contentions, but not at this time." 
Id. at 537, 404 P.2d at 901.  "An order dismissing the appeal
will be signed on presentation."  Id.   
Similarly in the instant case, although the May 18,
2016 final judgment was initially an appealable final judgment
pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a), HRCP Rule 58 and the holding in
Jenkins, the circuit court invoked its authority under HRCP
Rule 60(b) to set aside, and, thus, invalidate the May 18, 2016
final judgment by way of the September 6, 2017 order setting
aside judgment and granting a new trial.  Because the circuit
court invoked HRCP Rule 60(b) and set aside the May 18, 2016
final judgment, the rights of the parties involved remain
undetermined, the entire matter in Civil No. 12-1-0458(1) is
retained by the circuit court for a new trial that has not yet
taken place, and the September 6, 2017 order setting aside
judgment and granting a new trial is, in effect, an interlocutory
and non-final order.  See Morneau, 48 Haw. at 536, 404 P.2d at
900.  In other words, the proceeding that Reinhardt initiated by 
-6-NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
way of his May 16, 2017 post-judgment HRCP Rule 60(b) motion to
set aside the May 18, 2016 final judgment has now left the 
rights of a parties undetermined, and, by setting aside the 
May 18, 2016 final judgment and ordering a new trial in Civil 
No. 12-1-0458(1), the circuit court has effectively retained this
entire matter for further action, and, thus, the September 6,
2017 order setting aside judgment and granting a new trial does
not qualify an appealable final post-judgment order.  Ditto, 103
Hawai#i at 157, 80 P.3d at 978; Familian Northwest, Inc. , 68 Haw.
at 370, 714 P.2d at 938.  Upon entry of a future amended
judgment, any aggrieved party will be able to obtain appellate
review of the September 6, 2017 order setting aside judgment and
granting a new trial by way of a timely appeal from the future
amended judgment under the principle that "[a]n appeal from a
final judgment brings up for review all interlocutory orders not
appealable directly as of right which deal with issues in the
case."  Ueoka v. Szymanski , 107 Hawai #i 386, 396, 114 P.3d 892,
902 (2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); see,
e.g., Morneau , 48 Haw. at 537, 404 P.2d at 901 ("When and if the
order for new trial comes before us for review [by way of a
timely appeal from a future amended judgment,] we will have
occasion to consider such contentions, but not at this time."). 
In the absence of a valid appealable final judgment, the
September 6, 2017 order setting aside judgment and granting a new
trial is not an appealable final post-judgment order under HRS
§ 641-1(a).  Cf. Bailey v. DuVauchelle, 135 Hawai# i 482, 491, 353
P.3d 1024, 1033 (2015) ("Absent an underlying appealable final
judgment, the circuit court's rulings on a purported Rule 60(b)
motion are interlocutory and not appealable until entry of such a
judgment."  (Citations omitted)).  
Likewise, in the absence of an appealable final
judgment, the September 6, 2017 denying the motion to disqualify
counsel is not an appealable final post-judgment order under HRS
§ 641-1(a), because this order is merely a component part of the 
-7-NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
ongoing proceedings that are leading up to the new trial, and the
Supreme Court of Hawai# i has consistently held "that orders
denying disqualification are interlocutory and hence not
appealable as of right under the rule[.]"  Chuck v. St. Paul Fire
and Marine Insurance Company, 61 Haw. 552, 556, 606 P.2d 1320,
1323 (1980) (citation omitted); Wong v. Fong , 60 Haw. 601, 604,
593 P.2d 386, 389 (1979).  An order granting or denying a motion
to disqualify a party’s counsel "d[oes] not determine the merits
of the case, and it can be final for the purpose of appeal only
if it comes within the collateral order doctrine[.]"  Gomes v.
Kauwe’s Heirs, 52 Haw. 126, 127, 472 P.2d 119, 120 (1970)
(citation omitted; emphasis added; holding that an order denying
a motion to disqualify counsel is not appealable as a matter of
right); Chuck, 61 Haw. at 556-57, 606 P.2d at 1323-24 (holding
that an order granting a motion to disqualify counsel is not
appealable as a matter of right).  When analyzing whether the
collateral order doctrine applied to an order denying
disqualification of counsel, the Supreme Court of Hawai #i has
primarily focused on the third requirement of the collateral
order doctrine, i.e., that the order denying disqualification
must be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment:
In this case, we do not think that appellants will
suffer immediate and irreparable injury by a denial of their
appeal.  If the circuit court erred, that question may be
raised on appeal from judgment on the merits. . . .  To
allow appeals from all orders denying disqualification of
attorneys will invite delay by piecemeal appeals.
Gomes, 52 Haw. at 127, 472 P.2d at 120 (citations omitted;
emphasis added).  Thus, with respect to interlocutory orders
adjudicating motions to disqualify counsel, the Supreme Court of
Hawai#i has determined that, instead of an interlocutory appeal,
"a petition for a writ of mandamus and/or prohibition is an
appropriate vehicle for reviewing an order of disqualification." 
Straub Clinic & Hospital v. Kochi, 81 Hawai# i 410, 414, 917 P.2d
1284, 1288 (1996) (citation omitted).
-8-NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Absent an appealable final judgment, we lack appellate
jurisdiction under HRS § 641-1(a), and the Appellants' appeal is
premature.  
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Reinhardt's
September 20, 2017 motion to dismiss appellate court case number
CAAP-17-0000666 for lack of appellate jurisdiction is granted,
and appellate court case number CAAP-17-0000666 is dismissed.
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all other pending
motions in appellate court case number CAAP-17-0000666 are
dismissed as moot.
