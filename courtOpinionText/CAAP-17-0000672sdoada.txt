(2014).  3
Preston raises three points of error on appeal, 
contending that: (1) the District Court erred in denying his 
motion to dismiss after Honolulu Police Department (HPD) Officer 
Richard Townsend (Officer Townsend) failed to appear for further 
cross-examination on April 19, 2017; (2) Preston was denied his 
speedy trial and due process rights because the District Court continued the case for further trial multiple times over a span of 173 days; and (3) there was insufficient evidence to support a conviction of Harassment. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve Preston's points of error as follows: 
(1) Preston argues that the District Court erred by 
denying a motion to dismiss he purportedly made at trial, on April 19, 2017. Although a transcript of the proceeding is included in the record on appeal, it reflects no motion to dismiss. Minutes of the proceeding provide: "State omot [sic] to continue-off Townsend not present (was ordered to return); Denied Defense objection/move to dismiss-denied." However, 
3 HRS ยง 711-1106(1)(a) provides: "A person commits the offense of
harassment if, with intent to harass, annoy, or alarm any other person, that
person . . . [s]trikes, shoves, kicks, or otherwise touches another person inan offensive manner or subjects the other person to offensive physicalcontact[.]" 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Preston was tried along with co-defendants Joseph Dietz (Dietz) 
and Sierra Iona, and each defendant was represented by separate 
counsel. The minutes do not specify which defense counsel made the motion, the basis of the motion, or the District Court's reason for denying the motion. Thus, the minutes do not provide a sufficient record to review the issue on appeal. 
It was Preston's duty to obtain a complete transcript. 
"[A] defendant has a duty to reconstruct, modify, or supplement the missing portions of the record, and a failure to make a reasonable attempt to do so precludes him or her from alleging reversible error." State v. Bates, 84 Hawai# i 211, 217, 933 P.2d 
48, 54 (1997). Hawai
#i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rules 
10(c) and (e) "provide a criminal defendant with several remedies to correct or modify inaudible portions of the trial transcript." Bates, 84 Hawai# i at 218, 933 P.2d at 55. Upon review, it 
appears that Preston made no attempt to reconstruct the record pursuant to HRAP 10(c) or to correct or modify the record pursuant to HRAP 10(e) to cure the apparent omission in the transcript of the April 19, 2017 proceedings. See State v. 
Shigetani, CAAP-17-0000441, 2019 WL 1397385, *6 (Haw. App. Mar. 28, 2019) (SDO) ("In this case, the appellate record shows no attempt by Shigetani to supplement the record or otherwise utilize [HRAP] Rules 10(c) and (e) (2016) [to correct the transcript]."). 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Without a transcript of the motion to dismiss and the 
District Court's ruling on the motion, there is an insufficient 
record before the court to address Preston's contention that the District Court erred in denying an April 19, 2017 motion to dismiss. 
(2) Preston argues that the District Court deprived 
him of his right to confront Officer Townsend because Preston's cross-examination of the officer was extremely brief, spanned non-consecutive trial days, and was interspersed with testimony by other witnesses. Preston maintains that neither he nor the District Court could "adequately assess the credibility of the witness over such a disjointed duration." Related to this point is Preston's assertion that the District Court erred by continuing Officer Townsend's cross-examination when the officer failed to appear at trial on April 19, 2017, as ordered, and presented no excuse for his absence. 
There is nothing in the record on appeal indicating 
that Preston objected to the District Court's continuation of Officer Townsend's cross-examination, the order in which the State presented witnesses, or the length of time Preston was given to cross-examine Officer Townsend. Therefore, Preston waived these points. See HRAP Rule 28(b)(4). 
Nevertheless, because the issues implicate a 
fundamental constitutional right, we review them for plain error. See State v. Yoshino, 50 Haw. 287, 290, 439 P.2d 666, 668 (1968) 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
("We have stated in numerous cases that where fundamental 
constitutional rights are involved, this court will take cognizance of the issue though it is raised in this court for the first time.") (citations omitted); see also State v. Sprattling, 99 Hawai# i 312, 322, 55 P.3d 276, 286 (2002); State v. Bunn, 50 
Haw. 351, 355, 440 P.2d 528, 532 (1968). "[T]he main and essential purpose of confrontation is to secure for the opponent the opportunity of cross-examination, and the exposure of a witness' motivation in testifying is a proper and important function of the constitutionally protected right of cross examination." Birano v. State, 143 Hawai# i 163, 183-84, 426 P.3d 
387, 407-08 (2018) (citation, internal quotation marks, and brackets in original omitted). 
On the other hand, "[a] criminal 
defendant's 'right to confront and to cross-examine is not absolute and may, in appropriate cases, bow to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process.'" State v. 
Locken, 134 Hawai# i 376, 384, 341 P.3d 1176, 1184 (App. 2014) 
(citation omitted). 
Hawai# i Rules of Evidence (HRE
) Rule 611(a) provides: 
Control by court.  The court shall exercise reasonable 
control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses
and presenting evidence so as to (1) make the interrogationand presentation effective for the ascertainment of thetruth, (2) avoid needless consumption of time, and (3)protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment. 
"[HRE Rule 611(a)] states the common-law principle 
allowing the court broad discretion in determining order and mode 
of interrogation" and is intended "to define broad objectives and 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 to leave the attainment of those objectives to the discretion of 
the court." Commentary to HRE Rule 611. Under Rule 611, a trial court has discretion to schedule and determine courtroom procedure. State v. Christian, 88 Hawai# i 407, 422, 967 P.2d 
239, 254 (1998). 
Still, "the rules of evidence cannot override 
the constitutional rights of the accused." State v. Loher, 140 
Hawai# i 205, 219, 398 P.3d 794, 808 (2017) (citation and internal 
quotation marks omitted). 
On March 2, 2017, while Preston's counsel was cross-
examining Officer Townsend, the District Court interrupted to announce that the adjournment time had passed and that the District Court would have to continue trial. The District Court set the continued trial for April 19, 2017, and ordered several of the State's witnesses, including Officer Townsend, to appear on that date. 
On April 19, 2017, Officer Townsend was absent 
from trial. Officers Sean Costigan and William Suarez were 
questioned, and the District Court continued the trial to May 11 
and 12, 2017. On May 11, 2017, Officer Townsend was absent due to illness. On May 12, 2017, Officer Townsend appeared, and Preston finished cross-examining him. 
At the March 2, 2017 trial, Preston impeached Officer 
Townsend regarding his testimony that Preston was being aggressive when Officer Townsend arrived at the scene of the incident. Preston asked Officer Townsend to draw diagrams showing, among other things, where Corporal Derrick Sagawa 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(Corporal Sagawa) was pushed. When Preston resumed his cross-
examination of Officer Townsend on May 12, 2017, Preston began by 
reminding the officer that he had drawn diagrams on March 2, 2017. Preston showed him the diagrams and asked if he recognized them. Officer Townsend responded "Yes." Preston proceeded to ask a number of questions regarding how and why the push occurred. 
Although Preston claims he was not given adequate time 
to cross-examine Officer Townsend or a sufficient opportunity to impeach the officer's credibility due to the "disjointed" nature of his cross-examination, Preston cross-examined the officer at length, Preston's cross-examination on May 12, 2017 appeared to flow seamlessly from his questioning on March 2, 2017, Preston's cross-examination of Officer Townsend overall appeared to have been effective, and Preston does not contend that any query remained unasked or unanswered. 
We conclude that the District Court did not plainly err 
or abuse its discretion when it continued Preston's cross-examination of Officer Townsend and allowed the State to call other police officers to testify on April 19, and May 11, 2017, when Officer Townsend failed to appear. We further conclude that Preston has failed to show that the District Court deprived him of his due process right to meaningfully cross-examine Officer Townsend.

(3) Preston argues that his constitutional right to a 
speedy trial was violated because "173[] days from commencement 
of trial to resolution [of trial] was unreasonable, oppressive, and disorderly." 
This court has previously considered whether a 
defendant's speedy trial rights have been violated in circumstances where the trial commenced within 180 days of arrest, in compliance with Hawai# i Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 
48, but a relatively short evidentiary trial was conducted over a prolonged period of time. See State v. Paulmier, CAAP-15-
0000381, 2018 WL 3490557 (Haw. App. July 20, 2018) (mem. op.). In analyzing whether a defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial has been violated, Hawai# i courts apply the 
four-part test articulated in Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514 (1972). See State v. White, 92 Hawai# i 192, 201, 990 P.2d 90, 99 
(1999). 
"The four Barker
 factors are: (1) length of delay; (2) 
the reasons for the delay; (3) the defendant's assertion of his or her right to speedy trial; and (4) prejudice to the defendant." Id. at 201-02, 990 P.2d at 99-100 (citation 
omitted). 
Here, Preston objected to the lengthy and interrupted 
trial process as a violation of his right to a speedy trial. The District Court stated that it was due to the many other matters it has to handle on any given day and that it was taking into consideration the schedules of the various attorneys. While 
8  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
there are no other "findings" in the record that touch upon the 
Barker factors, and no written findings entered, it appears that Preston's trial was conducted over a period of nearly six months, on seven trial days, in roughly one to two hour segments.
4 
In State v. Visintin, 143 Hawai# i 143, 157-58, 426 P.3d 
367, 381-82 (2018), the supreme court held that this court erred in considering the defendant's speedy trial claim on the merits because the trial court in that case had not considered the Barker factors and had not made any written findings, nor had it stated findings or conclusions evaluating the Barker factors. Consistent with the supreme court's ruling in Visintin, this case must be remanded to the District Court for rendering of findings of fact and conclusions of law and applying the Barker factors. Id. at 163, 426 P.3d at 387. 
(4) Preston argues that his conviction was based on 
insufficient evidence because Corporal Sagawa testified inconsistently regarding whether a video camera was recording at the time of the incident underlying the Harassment charge against 
Preston, i.e., when Corporal Sagawa was reportedly shoved by Preston. 
"On appeal, the test for a claim of insufficient 
evidence is whether, viewing the evidence in the light most 
4 As the length of some of the trial sessions is unclear from the
transcripts, and there are no findings of fact, this observation is merely in
aid of review of this point of error and should not be considered a factual
finding by this court. 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
favorable to the State, there is substantial evidence to support 
the conclusion of the trier of fact." State v. Pesentheiner, 95 
Hawai# i 290, 293, 22 P.3d 86, 89 (App. 2001) (citation omitted; 
format altered). 
In this case, the District Court found that all of the 
State's witnesses were credible and testified credibly. See id. 
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted) ("[I]t is well-settled that an appellate court will not pass upon issues dependent upon the credibility of witnesses[.]"). Officer Townsend testified that when he arrived at the scene of the incident, Officer Kubo told him there had been a fight inside the club and bouncers escorted Preston outside. Officer Townsend saw Preston, apparently intoxicated, aggressively and angrily confronting police officers who were preventing him from re-entering the club. Preston yelled and swore at the officers for five to ten minutes. Corporal Sagawa also testified he also saw Preston yelling and trying to re-enter the club. 
Officer Townsend testified that at some point, Dietz, 
Preston's brother, exited the nightclub. Officer Kubo testified that Preston and Dietz, both clearly upset and agitated, swore and called out the staff to fight because they would not let Preston and Dietz back into the club. The police asked Preston and Dietz to leave. Officer Suarez and Corporal Sagawa testified that the men eventually walked away, yelling, screaming, and challenging officers to fight. Officer Suarez testified that the 
10 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
men walked to the back of the club and argued with a group of 
officers who asked them to leave, then continued walking. 
Corporal Sagawa testified that as Preston and Dietz 
walked, they continued to behave aggressively. When Corporal Sagawa told the men they were under arrest and grabbed Preston's arm, Preston turned around and shoved the corporal with both hands in the chest area, sending him back a few feet. Four officers all testified that they saw Preston push Corporal Sagawa in the chest area, sending the corporal backwards. 
The aforementioned testimony provides substantial 
evidence showing Preston shoved Corporal Sagawa. The District Court reasonably inferred that Preston shoved Corporal Sagawa with the intent to harass, annoy, or alarm him, as immediately before the shove, Corporal Sagawa told Preston and Dietz they were under arrest, and throughout the incident, Preston had been acting belligerently toward the police. See HRS ยง 711-
1106(1)(a). 
For the foregoing reasons, the District Court's August 
22, 2017 Judgment is vacated, and this case must be remanded to the District Court for rendering of findings of fact and conclusions of law and applying the Barker factors. If the District Court concludes that Preston's constitutional right to a speedy trial was violated, the District Court must dismiss the case with prejudice. See Visintin, 143 Hawai# i at 157, 426 P.3d 
at 381. 
If the District Court concludes that Preston's 
11 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 constitutional right to a speedy trial was not violated, an
amended judgment of conviction may be entered.
