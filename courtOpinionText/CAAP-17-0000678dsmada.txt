APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 14-1-0243 (JKW))
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, and Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
Upon review of the record, it appears that:
(1) On September 22, 2017, Defendant-Appellant Paul
Nguyen (Paul Nguyen), pro se, filed the notice of appeal;
(2) The notice of appeal indicates it is on behalf of
Paul Nguyen and "Kim Ngyen," but it is signed by Paul Nguyen
only.  Kim T. Ta (Kim Ta) is a defendant in the underlying case. 
It is unclear whether Kim Ta is the same person as Kim Ngyen.  In
any event, neither Kim Ngyen nor Kim Ta signed the notice of
appeal.  Paul Nguyen is not an attorney, and, therefore, may not
execute the notice of appeal or enter an appearance for Kim Ngyen
or Kim Ta.  See HRS §§ 605-2 & 605-14 (2016); Oahu Plumbing &
Sheet Metal, Ltd. v. Kona Constr., Inc., 60 Haw. 372, 377, 590NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
P.2d 570, 573 (1979).  Thus, the notice of appeal is valid as to
Paul Nguyen only;
(3) On November 21, 2017, the circuit court clerk filed
the record on appeal, and the appellate clerk notified the
parties that the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief were
due on or before December 1, 2017, and January 2, 2018,
respectively;
(4) Paul Nguyen did not file either document or request
an extension of time;
(5) On January 17, 2018, the appellate clerk notified
Paul Nguyen that the time for filing the statement of
jurisdiction and opening brief had expired, the matter would be
called to the court's attention on January 29, 2018, for
appropriate action, which could include dismissal of the appeal,
pursuant to Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rules 12.1(e)
and 30, and any request for relief from default should be made by
motion; and
(6) Paul Nguyen took no further action in this appeal.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is
dismissed. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are
dismissed as moot.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, March 6, 2018.
