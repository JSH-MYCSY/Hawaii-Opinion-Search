MARY LYNN KILGORE BARNARD, Claimant/Appellant/Appellant,
v.
9TH LIFE HAWAII, Employer/Appellee/Appellee,
and
SPECIAL COMPENSATION FUND, Appellee
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
(CASE NO. AB 2016-348(M) (7-16-00331))
ORDER GRANTING SEPTEMBER 28, 2017 MOTION TO DISMISS
APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
Upon consideration of (1) Employer/Appellee/Appellee
9th Life Hawaii's (9th Life Hawaii) September 28, 2017 motion to
dismiss appellate court case number CAAP-17-0000682 for lack of
appellate jurisdiction, and (2) the record that the clerk of the
Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board1/ (LIRAB) filed on
April 5, 2018,2/ it appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction
over Claimant/Appellant/Appellant Kilgore Barnard's (Kilgore
Barnard) appeal from the LIRAB's September 6, 2017 interlocutory
order in LIRAB Case No. 2016-348 (M), because the September 6,
2017 interlocutory order does not qualify as an appealable final
1/At all relevant times, the Labor and Industrial Relations 
Appeals Board appears to have been composed of Chair Danny J. Vasconcellos,
Member Melanie S. Matsui and Member Marie C. Laderta in LIRAB Case No. 
AB 2016-348 (M).
2/Kilgore Barnard, pro se, filed no response to the September 28,
2017 motion.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
order under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 386-88 (2015) and 
HRS § 91-14(a) (2012 & Supp. 2017).
While HRS § 386-88 authorizes an appeal from a LIRAB
final order directly to this court, HRS § 91-14(a) governs the
appealability requirements for any LIRAB order.
For purposes of HRS § 91-14(a), we have defined "final
order" to mean an order ending the proceedings, leaving
nothing further to be accomplished. . . .  Consequently, an
order is not final if the rights of a party involved remain
undetermined or if the matter is retained for further
action.
Bocalbos v. Kapiolani Med. Ctr., 89 Hawai #i 436, 439, 974 P.2d
1026, 1029 (1999) (citation and some internal quotation marks
omitted). 
When the LIRAB's determination of a claimant's workers'
compensation claim for benefits "has not been made[,] . . . the
requisite decree of finality is lacking with respect to th[e]
case[,]" and the appellate court lacks jurisdiction.  Mitchell v.
State Dep't. of Educ., 77 Hawai #i 305, 308, 884 P.2d 368, 371
(1994) (citation omitted); see also Williams v. Kleenco, 2 Haw.
App. 219, 629 P.2d 125, (1981) (dismissing an appeal from a LIRAB
decision and order remanding the matter to the Director with
instructions to determine the amount of the award, because such a
decision and order is not final and appealable).
In the instant case, the September 6, 2017
interlocutory order does not finally adjudicate a benefit or
penalty under the worker's compensation law.  Instead, the
September 6, 2017 interlocutory order is a preliminary order that
closes the record on appeal for LIRAB Case No. AB 2016-348 (M),
provides a then-future November 8, 2017 deadline for the parties
to file their respective future post-trial briefs in LIRAB Case
No. AB 2016-348 (M), denies 9th Life Hawaii's motion to dismiss
Kilgore Barnard's appeal in LIRAB Case No. AB 2016-348 (M),
declares the issue that the LIRAB intends to eventually resolve
in LIRAB Case No. AB 2016-348 (M), and declares which exhibits
the LIRAB accepts into evidence and excludes from evidence in
LIRAB Case No. AB 2016-348 (M).  The LIRAB has neither announced
nor entered its final decision and order regarding any benefit or
-2-NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
penalty in LIRAB Case No. AB 2016-348 (M).  Consequently the
September 6, 2017 interlocutory order lacks the requisite
finality under HRS § 91-14(a) to qualify as an appealable final
order under HRS § 386-88.  Absent an appealable final decision
and order, we lack appellate jurisdiction, and Kilgore Barnard's
appeal is premature.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that 9th Life Hawaii's
September 28, 2017 motion to dismiss this appeal is granted, and
appellate court case number CAAP-17-0000682 is dismissed for lack
of appellate jurisdiction.
