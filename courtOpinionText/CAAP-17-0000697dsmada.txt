NO. CAAP-17-0000697
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
BRIAN A. BILBERRY, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
CHRISTOPHER FISHKIN, Defendant-Appellant.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
(CASE NO. DC-TRO 17-1-0178)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
jurisdiction over this appeal by Respondent-Appellant Christopher
Fishkin ( Appellant ) because his September 28, 2017 notice of
appeal from the August 28, 2017 Order Granting Petition for
Injunction Against Harassment ( Order Granting Petition), issued
by the District Court of the Second Circuit, Wailuku Division,1
is untimely, under Rule 4(a)(1) of the Hawai# i Rules of Appellate
Procedure ( HRAP).
Although the August 28, 2017 Order Granting Petition is
final and appealable, pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes 
ยง 641-1(a) (2016), Appellant failed to file his notice of appeal
within thirty days after entry of the order, as required by HRAP
Rule 4(a)(1).  The failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a
civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot
waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise
1/  The Honorable Blaine J. Kobayashi issued the Order.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
of judicial discretion.  Bacon v. Karlin , 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727
P.2d 1127, 1129 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or
justice is authorized to change the jurisdictional requirements
contained in Rule 4 of these rules."); HRAP Rule 26(e) ("The
reviewing court for good cause shown may relieve a party from a
default occasioned by any failure to comply with these rules,
except the failure to give timely notice of appeal."). 
Therefore, we lack appellate jurisdiction over the appeal. 
Accordingly,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellate No. CAAP-17-0000697
is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, June 26, 2018.
