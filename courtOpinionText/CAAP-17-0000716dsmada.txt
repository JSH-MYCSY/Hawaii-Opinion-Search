GRANTING DECEMBER 18, 2017 MOTION TO DISMISS
APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
AND
DISMISSING ALL PENDING MOTIONS AS MOOT
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
Upon review of (1) Employer/Appellee/Appellee Honolulu
Builders, LLC's (Honolulu Builders), and Insurance Carrier/
Appellee/Appellee First Insurance Company of Hawaii, Ltd.'s
(First Insurance), December 18, 2017 motion to dismiss appellate
court case number CAAP-17-0000716 for lack of appellate
jurisdiction, (2) Claimant/Appellant/Appellant William A.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Kruger's (Kruger) December 21, 2017 memorandum in opposition to
the December 18, 2017 motion, and (3) the record, it appears that
we lack appellate jurisdiction over Kruger's appeal from the
Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board's1 (LIRAB)
September 28, 2017 decisions and orders in both LIRAB Case 
No. AB 2012-220 (H) and LIRAB Case No. AB 2016-179 (H), because
neither decision and order qualifies as an appealable final order
under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 386-88 (2015) and HRS 
§ 91-14(a) (2012 & Supp. 2017).
While HRS § 386-88 authorizes an appeal from an LIRAB
final order directly to this court, HRS § 91-14(a) governs the
appealability requirements for any LIRAB order.
For purposes of HRS § 91-14(a), we have defined "final
order" to mean an order ending the proceedings, leaving
nothing further to be accomplished. . . .  Consequently, an
order is not final if the rights of a party involved remain
undetermined or if the matter is retained for further
action.
Bocalbos v. Kapiolani Med. Ctr., 89 Hawai #i 436, 439, 974 P.2d
1026, 1029 (1999) (citation and some internal quotation marks
omitted).  "[A]n order that finally adjudicates a benefit or
penalty under the worker's compensation law is an appealable
final order under HRS § 91-14(a), although other issues remain." 
Lindinha v. Hilo Coast Processing Co., 104 Hawai# i 164, 168, 86
P.3d 973, 977 (2004) (citation omitted).  For example, "a
decision that finally adjudicates the matter of medical and
temporary disability benefits is an appealable final order under
HRS § 91-14(a), even though the matter of permanent disability
has been left for later determination."  Bocalbos, 89 Hawai# i at
443, 974 P.2d at 1033.
In contrast, when the LIRAB's determination of a
claimant's workers' compensation claim for benefits "has not been
made[,] . . . the requisite decree of finality is lacking with
respect to th[e] case[,]" and the appellate court lacks
jurisdiction.  Mitchell v. State Dep't. of Educ., 77 Hawai #i 305,
1/  At all relevant times, the Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals
Board appears to have been composed of Chair Danny J. Vasconcellos, Member
Melanie S. Matsui and Member Marie C. Laderta in both LIRAB Case No. 
AB 2012-220 (H) and LIRAB Case No. AB 2016-179 (H).

308, 884 P.2d 368, 371 (1994) (citation omitted).  For example,
in Mitchell, an appellant named Mitchell had asserted claims for
workers' compensation benefits for two separate injuries that
occurred on two separate dates: (1) November 1, 1989, and
(2) February 5, 1990.  When Mitchell's claims were before the
LIRAB, the LIRAB "determined the first incident to be compensable
but denied compensation for the second incident."  Id. at 307,
884 P.2d at 370.  Although the LIRAB conclusively determined
Mitchell's rights as to the second incident, the LIRAB did not
finally determine Mitchell's rights as to the first incident,
and, instead, the LIRAB "remanded [the matter to the Director]
for a determination as to what workers' compensation benefits, if
any, Mitchell is entitled for the first incident period between
November 1, 1989 through February 5, 1990."  Id. (internal
quotation marks and original brackets omitted).  When Mitchell
appealed from the LIRAB's decision to the Supreme Court of
Hawai#i, the court held that the LIRAB's decision lacked the
requisite decree of finality for an appeal because Mitchell's
compensation benefits for the first incident remained
undetermined:
In the case before us, there was no final decision
with respect to Mitchell's compensation benefits for the
first incident, which occurred on November 1, 1989.  As
stated previously, the Board determined the first incident
to be compensable and reversed the Director's decision,
remanding the case for a "determination as to what worker's
compensation benefits, if any, [Mitchell was] entitled for
the period between November 1, 1989 through February 5,
1990."  Such determination has not been made; therefore, the
requisite degree of finality is lacking with respect to this
case.
Id. at 307-08, 884 P.2d at 370-71 (citation omitted; original
brackets).  "This case will be ripe for judicial review only
after the Director makes a determination as to the amount of
compensation owed."  Id. at 308, 884 P.2d at 371.  "We therefore
conclude that we lack appellate jurisdiction to consider the
merits of this appeal.  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed." 
Id.; see also Williams v. Kleenco, 2 Haw. App. 219, 629 P.2d 125,
(1981) (dismissing an appeal from a LIRAB decision and order
-3-NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
remanding the matter to the Director with instructions to
determine the amount of the award, because such a decision and
order is not final and appealable).
Kruger has designated two underlying LIRAB cases in
this appeal, namely LIRAB Case No. AB 2012-220 (H) and LIRAB Case
No. AB 2016-179 (H).  The LIRAB entered a separate and distinct
September 28, 2017 decision and order in both LIRAB Case No. AB
2012-220 (H) and LIRAB Case No. AB 2016-179 (H), but, in each of
those two September 28, 2017 decisions and orders, the LIRAB
vacated a decision by the Director and remanded the matter to the
Director with instructions to determine the "nature" of Kruger's
injury that is the subject of Kruger's claim in each respective
LIRAB case.  Without a final determination of the compensation
for each injury, neither of the two September 28, 2017 decisions
and orders has the requisite finality under HRS § 91-14(a) to
qualify as an appealable final order under HRS § 386-88.  Absent
an appealable final decision and order, we lack appellate
jurisdiction, and Kruger's appeal is premature.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Honolulu 
Builders' and First Insurance's December 18, 2017 motion to
dismiss this appeal is granted, and appellate court case number
CAAP-17-0000716 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions
in appellate court case number CAAP-17-0000716 are dismissed as
moot.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, March 27, 2018.
