NO. CAAP-17-0000721
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI #I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
HARVEY K. KELIIKOA, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
(CASE NO. 3DTC-14-001787)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Fujise and Chan, JJ.)
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
appellate jurisdiction over Defendant-Appellant Harvey K.
Keliikoa's ("Keliikoa") appeal in appellate court case number
CAAP-17-0000721 from the Honorable Bruce A. Larson's
September 21, 2017 interlocutory order setting a trial date for
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawaii's ("the State") charges
against Keliikoa for operating a motor vehicle without a valid
license in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") ยง 286-102
(2007 & Supp. 2014) and operating a motor vehicle without
liability insurance in violation of HRS ยง 431:10C-104 (2005) in
district court criminal case number 3DTC-14-001787.
"The right to an appeal is strictly statutory."  State
v. Ontiveros, 82 Hawai# i 446, 449, 923 P.2d 388, 391 (1996)
(citation omitted).  The Hawai #i Intermediate Court of Appeals
has jurisdiction "[t]o hear and determine appeals from any court
or agency when appeals are allowed by law[.]"  HRS ยง 602-57(1)NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(2016).  HRS ยง 641-12(a) (2016) is the statute providing that
"[a]ppeals upon the record shall be allowed from all final
decisions and final judgments of district courts in all criminal
matters."  Consequently, "in order to appeal a criminal matter in
the district court, the appealing party must appeal from a
written judgment or order that has been filed with the clerk of
the court pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(b)(3)."  State v. Bohannon , 102
Hawai#i 228, 236, 74 P.3d 980, 988 (2003); see also  Rule 32(c)(2)
of the Hawai# i Rules of Penal Procedure.  And even when the
district court enters a judgment of conviction, "[j]udgments of
conviction are not final unless they include the final
adjudication and the final sentence."  State v. Kilborn , 109
Hawai#i 435, 442, 127 P.3d 95, 102 (App. 2005) (dismissing an
appeal from a district court judgment of conviction that did not
finally determine the entire sentence).  In the instant case, the
district court has not yet held a trial, much less rendered a
final decision, on the State's criminal charges against Keliikoa
in district court criminal case number 3DTC-14-001787.  Absent an
appealable final judgment, the September 21, 2017 interlocutory
order is not eligible for appellate review because we lack
appellate jurisdiction, and Keliikoa's appeal is premature.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
case number CAAP-17-0000721 is dismissed for lack of appellate
jurisdiction.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, December 18, 2017.
