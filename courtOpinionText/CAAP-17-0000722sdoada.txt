ALBERT BIRMINGHAM, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Respondent-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(S.P.P. NO. 15-1-0001 (CR. NO. 1PC101000166)) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By:  Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Chan, JJ.) 
Petitioner-Appellant Albert Birmingham (Birmingham) 
appeals from the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order 
Denying Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to 
Release Petitioner from Custody, entered on September 19, 2017, 
in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court).1 
On appeal, Birmingham challenges Conclusions of Law 
Nos. 2, 3, and 4.  Citing Coulter v. State, 116 Hawai# i 181, 172 
P.3d 493 (2007), Birmingham claims the Hawaii Paroling Authority (HPA) acted arbitrarily, capriciously, and inconsistently with 
the HPA Guidelines by setting his Level of Punishment at 
Level III in a September 7, 2012 Notice and Order of Fixing 
Minimum Term(s) of Imprisonment because, in order to set 
punishment at Level III, the HPA was required to find he was 
convicted of three or more felonies.  Birmingham contends his

Level of Punishment should have been Level I because he had only 
one prior felony conviction. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we 
resolve Birmingham's point of error as follows: 
In a September 7, 2012 Notice and Order of Fixing 
Minimum Term(s) of Imprisonment, Birmingham's Level of Punishment 
was determined to be Level III and the Significant factors cited 
were "(1) Nature of Offense; (2) Character and Attitude of 
Offender With Respect to Criminal Activity or Lifestyle; 
(3) Efforts Made to Live Pro-Social Life Prior to Commitment to 
Prison; (4) Involvement of Offender in Instant Offense."  The HPA 
complied with Coulter by specifying the Level of Punishment and 
the significant criteria upon which the decision was based. 
Coulter, 116 Hawai
#i at 184-85, 172 P.3d at 496-97.  
The HPA Guidelines for Establishing Minimum Terms of 
Imprisonment (HPA Guidelines) states "The person has been 
convicted previously of three or more felonies committed at 
different times when s/he was 18 years of age or older," under 
the Criminal History criteria for Level III.  The Criminal 
History criteria for Level I applies when "The person has no more 
than 1 prior felony conviction since he or she was 18 years old." 
However, the HPA Guidelines also state "The criteria are 
presented by level of punishment, and each case will normally 
include criteria from one or more levels.  The Hawaii Paroling 
Authority will decide which criteria will determine level of 
punishment in any given case."  Thus, the HPA was not required to 
find Birmingham met all the criteria or any one specific 
criterion--such as three prior felony convictions within the 
Criminal History criterion in Level III-â€“within any one Level in 
order to set his punishment at that Level.  Therefore, 
Birmingham's point of error is without merit. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Findings of Fact, 
Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying Petition to Vacate, Set
