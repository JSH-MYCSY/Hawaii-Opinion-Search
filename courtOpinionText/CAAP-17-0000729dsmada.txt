ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that: 
(1)
 On October 19, 2017, self-represented Defendant-
Appellant Vinh Le (Le) filed the notice of appeal; 
(2) On December 13, 2017, the district court clerk 
filed the record on appeal, and the appellate clerk notified the parties that the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief were due on or before December 26, 2017, and January 22, 2018, respectively; 
(3) Le did not file either document or request an 
extension of time; 
(4)
 On May 4, 2018, the appellate clerk notified Le 
that the time for filing the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief had expired, the matter would be called to the court's attention on May 14, 2018, for appropriate action, which could include dismissal of the appeal, pursuant to 
Hawai# i Rules 
of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rules 12.1(e) and 30, and Le may request relief from default by motion; NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(5) The appellate clerk mailed the December 13, 2017 
notice of entering case on calender and the May 4, 2018 default 
notice to Le at the address indicated in the record on appeal. The United States Postal Service returned both of the notices, marked "Deceased, Unable to Forward"; 
(6) On October 30, 2018, the court ordered appellate 
counsel for Plaintiff-Appellee Association of Apartment Owners of Country Club Hawaii, Inc. (Country Club Hawaii) to confirm whether Le is deceased and, if so, whether a special administrator or personal representative has been appointed; and 
(7) On November 29, 2018, Country Club Hawaii filed a 
suggestion of death upon the record, under HRAP Rule 43(a), indicating Le passed away in November 2017. Country Club Hawaii's counsel separately filed a declaration indicating there does not appear to be a special administrator or personal representative for Le's estate, "or any person to contact in that regard"; and 
(8) The court will dismiss the appeal for failure to 
file the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief, and based upon Le's death and there being no substitute for Le. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed.
