L
EONARD, PRESIDING JUDGE, HIRAOKA AND MCCULLEN, JJ. 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY HIRAOKA, J. 
Plaintiff-Appellant Wayne Okutsu
 sued Defendant-
Appellee State of Hawai# i under the State Tort Liability Act 
(
STLA), Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) Chapter 662. The STLA 
requires that a non-medical tort action be commenced within two 
years after the claim accrues. The State moved to dismiss based  
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
upon the STLA statute of limitations. The Circuit Court of the 
First Circuit granted the motion.1 
Okutsu appealed. He contends that the State waived the 
statute of limitations, that the time bar should have been equitably tolled, or that there were genuine issues of material fact about waiver or equitable tolling. We hold that the time bar imposed by the legislature is jurisdictional; it is not subject to waiver by, or equitable tolling based upon conduct of, the executive branch. Okutsu's lawsuit was filed more than two years after his tort claim accrued. Accordingly, we affirm the Final Judgment entered by the circuit court on May 16, 2018. 
I. BACKGROUND 
Okutsu had been incarcerated in a Hawai# i correctional 
facility. 
His complaint, seeking tort damages from the State, 
was filed on March 9, 2017. It alleged that the State negligently held Okutsu for 49 days after his release date. The record isn't clear about when Okutsu should have been released from custody, or when he was actually released.
2 However, there 
is no dispute that Okutsu was actually released some time in 2012 — more than four years before he filed his complaint. 
The State filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Hawai# i 
Rules of Civil Procedure ( 
HRCP) Rule 12(b)(6).3 The State 
1 The Honorable Virginia Lea Crandall presided. 
2 Okutsu's complaint alleged that the State's "acts of negligence
occurred beginning about February, 2012[.]" The Hawaii Paroling Authority set
Okutsu's minimum term to expire on July 17, 2012. By letter datedFebruary 16, 2012, the Department of Public Safety informed Okutsu that it hadrecalculated his "maximum term release dates[.]" Okutsu's memorandum in opposition to the State's motion to dismiss states that he was released onSeptember 11, 2012, but there is no declaration or exhibit in the recordsupporting the allegation. The 49th day before September 11, 2012, isJuly 24, 2012. 
3 HRCP Rule 12(b) provides, in relevant part: 
Every defense, in law or fact, to a claim for relief in anypleading, . . . shall be asserted in the responsive pleadingthereto if one is required, except that the followingdefenses may at the option of the pleader be made by motion:
(continued...)

3 (...continued)FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
contended that Okutsu's action was barred by the STLA's two-year 
statute of limitations. Okutsu's memorandum in opposition attached a declaration from his attorney, Jack Schweigert, and a 
number of emails between Schweigert and former deputy attorney 
general John F. Molay. Okutsu argued: the State, through Molay, 
had waived the statute of limitations; the statute of limitations 
should be equitably tolled because of Molay's conduct; or alternatively, there were genuine issues of material fact about waiver or equitable tolling. 
The State's reply memorandum attached a declaration 
from Molay and copies of more communication between Molay and Schweigert. Schweigert was representing a number of clients who had over-detention claims against the State. The State conceded that Molay agreed not to assert the statute of limitations defense against certain of Schweigert's over-detention clients, but argued that Okutsu wasn't one of them. 
The State's motion was heard on June 19, 2017. The 
circuit court took the motion under advisement. On October 2, 2017, the court entered the "Order Granting Defendant State of Hawaii's Motion to Dismiss Complaint Seeking Damages[.]" This appeal followed. After Okutsu's notice of appeal was filed, we temporarily remanded for entry of an appealable final judgment pursuant to HRS § 602-57(3) (2016) and Waikiki v. Ho# omaka Vill. 
Ass'n of Apartment Owners, 140 Hawai# i 197, 204, 398 P.3d 786, 
793 (2017). 
The circuit court entered the Final Judgment on 
May 16, 2018. 
II. POINTS OF ERROR 
Okutsu's opening brief argues that the circuit court 
erred by granting the State's motion to dismiss because: 
(1) the 
State waived the statute of limitations; (2) the statute of 
limitations should have been equitably tolled; or (3) there was a 
. . . (6) failure to state a claim upon which relief can be
granted[.] 
3 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
genuine issue of material fact about whether the statute of 
limitations was waived or should be equitably tolled. After briefing was completed we issued an order, pursuant to Hawai# i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure ( 
HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4),4 inviting 
supplemental briefing "on the legal issue of whether the executive branch can waive the HRS § 662-4 time bar on the State's waiver of sovereign immunity." Neither party filed a supplemental brief. 
III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A. Motion to Dismiss 
The State's motion to dismiss was filed under HRCP 
Rule 12(b)(6). Okutsu's memorandum in opposition and the State's reply memorandum both presented matters outside the pleadings that weren't excluded by the circuit court. Thus, we review the circuit court's decision using the standard applicable to HRCP Rule 56 motions for summary judgment. HRCP Rule 12(b).
5 
An appellate court reviews a trial court's grant of 
summary judgment de novo using the same standard applied by the trial court. Nozawa v. Operating Engineers Local Union No. 3, 
142 Hawai# i 331, 338, 418 P.3d 1187, 1194 (2018). Summary 
judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, answers to 
4 HRAP Rule 28(b)(4) provides, in relevant part: 
If an appellate court, when acting on a case on appeal,
contemplates basing the disposition of the case wholly or inpart upon an issue of plain error not raised by the partiesthrough briefing, it shall not affirm, reverse, or vacatethe case without allowing the parties the opportunity tobrief the potential plain-error issue prior to disposition. 
5 HRCP Rule 12(b) provides, in relevant part: 
If, on a motion asserting the defense numbered (6) to
dismiss for failure of the pleading to state a claim uponwhich relief can be granted, matters outside the pleadingare presented to and not excluded by the court, the motionshall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed ofas provided in Rule 56, and all parties shall be givenreasonable opportunity to present all material madepertinent to such a motion by Rule 56. 
4 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the 
affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Id.
 at 342, 418 P.3d at 1198. Moreover, an 
appellate court "may affirm a grant of summary judgment on any ground appearing in the record, even if the circuit court did not rely on it." Reyes v. Kuboyama, 76 Hawai# i 137, 140, 870 P.2d 
1281, 1284 (1994) (citations omitted). 
B. Statutory Interpretation 
"The interpretation of a statute is a question of law 
reviewable de novo." Taylor-Rice v. State, 105 Hawai# i 104, 108, 
94 P.3d 659, 663 (2004) (cleaned up). 
IV. DISCUSSION 
"[T]he State's liability is limited by its sovereign 
immunity, except where there has been a 'clear relinquishment' of immunity and the State has consented to be sued." In re 
Arbitration Between Hawai# i State Teachers Association and State 
Dep't of Educ., 140 Hawai# i 381, 396, 400 P.3d 582, 597 (2017) 
(quoting Taylor-Rice, 105 Hawai# i at 109, 94 P.3d at 664). The 
term sovereign immunity "refers to the general rule, incorporated in the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution, that a state cannot be sued in federal court without its consent or an express waiver of its immunity. The doctrine also precludes such suits in state courts." Id.
 (quoting Nelson v. Hawaiian Homes 
Comm'n
, 130 Hawai# i 162, 168, 307 P.3d 142, 148 (2013)). 
A. The legislature's two-year limitation on the
State's relinquishment of sovereign immunitycannot be waived by, or tolled by the conductof, the executive branch. 
The Territory of Hawai# i relinquished sovereign 
immunity from tort liability in 1957. 
The legislature passed 
Act 312, titled "An Act Creating a New Chapter to Permit Tort 
Claims Against the Territory of Hawaii." 1957 Haw. Sess. Laws 
5 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Act 312, at 384-86. Act 312 was codified in Revised Laws of 
Hawaii (RLH) Chapter 245A and was given the short title 
"Territorial Tort Liability Act" (TTLA).  It included this 
provision: 
§ 245A-2. Waiver and liability of Territory . The 
Territory hereby waives its immunity for liability for the
torts of its employees and shall be liable in the samemanner and to the same extent as a private individual underlike circumstances, but shall not be liable for interestprior to judgment or for punitive damages. If, however, inany case wherein death was caused, the Territory shall beliable only for actual or compensatory damages measured bythe pecuniary injuries resulting from such death to thepersons respectively, for whose benefit the action wasbrought. 
RLH § 245A-2 (Supp. 1957). 
The TTLA contained a statute of limitations: 
§ 245A-4. Statute of limitation.  A tort claim 
against the Territory of Hawaii shall be forever barredunless action is begun within two years after such claimaccrues. 
RLH § 245A-4 (Supp. 1957). 
The TTLA was renamed the State Tort Liability Act in 
1960.  When the Hawaii Revised Statutes were published in 1968, 
the STLA was codified as HRS Chapter 662. Other than changing 
the word "Territory" to "State," HRS § 662-4 (1968) was identical to RLH § 245A-4 (Supp. 1957). 6
In 1976, the legislature amended HRS § 662-4 by adding 
an exception to the two-year time bar for medical tort claims. 1976 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 219, § 16 at 539; see Savini v. Univ. of Haw., 113 Hawai# i 459, 466, 153 P.3d 1144, 1151 (2007) 
(recognizing that 1976 amendment to HRS § 662-4 lengthened the limitation period for medical malpractice claims against the State). HRS § 662-4 hasn't been amended since 1976, and currently provides: 
6 Hawai #i became a state in 1959. Kalima v. State , 111 Hawai #i 84,
87, 137 P.3d 990, 993 (2006) ("[T]he Territory of Hawai #i became a state on 
August 1, 1959[.]") 
6 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
§662-4 Statute of limitations . A tort claim against
the State shall be forever barred unless action is begun
within two years after the claim accrues, except in the caseof a medical tort claim when the limitation of action provisions set forth in section 657-7.3 shall apply.[ ] 
7
HRS § 662-4 (2016). 
The two-year limitation on the State's relinquishment 
of sovereign immunity for non-medical torts is a term of the 
legislature's consent for the State to be sued in tort. As the United States Supreme Court explained: 
Most statutes of limitations seek primarily to protect
defendants against stale or unduly delayed claims. Thus,
the law typically treats a limitations defense as anaffirmative defense that the defendant must raise at the pleadings stage and that is subject to rules of forfeitureand waiver. Such statutes also typically permit courts totoll the limitations period in light of special equitableconsiderations. 
Some statutes of limitations, however, seek . . . to
achieve a broader system-related goal, such as . . .limiting the scope of a governmental waiver of sovereignimmunity  . . . . The Court has often read the time limits 
of these statutes as more absolute, say, as requiring acourt to decide a timeliness question despite a waiver, oras forbidding a court to consider whether certain equitableconsiderations warrant extending a limitations period. As convenient shorthand, the Court has sometimes referred tothe time limits in such statutes as "jurisdictional." 
John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, 552 U.S. 130, 133-34, 
128 S. Ct. 750, 753, 169 L. Ed. 2d 591 (2008) (emphasis added) (citations omitted). The legislature did not consent to the State being sued for a non-medical tort more than two years afterthe claim accrued. The statutory time limitation on the State's relinquishment of sovereign liability can only be extended by the 
 
legislature. See W.C. Peacock & Co. v. Republic of Hawaii, 11 
Haw. 404, 406 (Haw. Rep. 1898) (holding that "special permission 
from the . . . Legislature" was required to waive statute of limitations for contract claims against the government); United States v. Dalm, 494 U.S. 596, 610, 110 S. Ct. 1361, 1369, 108 L. 
7 Okutsu's complaint did not allege a medical tort claim. 
7 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Ed. 2d 548 (1990) ("If any principle is central to our 
understanding of sovereign immunity, it is that the power to consent to such suits is reserved to Congress."); 
see also In re 
Haw. State Teachers Ass'n, 140 Hawai# i at 396-97, 400 P.3d at 
597-98 ("[A] waiver of sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed in statutory text . . . [and] it is not a court's right to extend the waiver of sovereign immunity more broadly than has been directed 
by the legislature[.]") (emphasis added) (cleaned 
up). The HRS § 662-4 statute of limitations is thus jurisdictional. It cannot be waived by the executive branch, nor is it subject to equitable tolling because of the executive branch's conduct. Thus, the circuit court had no jurisdiction over Okutsu's lawsuit, which was filed more than two years after his claim accrued. 
B. The plain language of HRS § 662-4 shows that
the statute of limitations cannot be waived by the executive branch. 
Hawai
#i has adopted this guidance from federal law to 
determine whether the State has waived its sovereign immunity: 
(1) a waiver of the Government's sovereign immunity will bestrictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of thesovereign; (2) a waiver of sovereign immunity must beunequivocally expressed in statutory text; (3) a statute'slegislative history cannot supply a waiver that does notappear clearly in any statutory text; (4) it is not acourt's right to extend the waiver of sovereign immunitymore broadly than has been directed by the legislature; and(5) sovereign immunity is not to be waived by policyarguments. 
In re Haw. State Tchrs. Ass'n, 140 Hawai# i at 396–97, 400 P.3d at 
597–98 (cleaned up). 
The language of HRS § 662-4 unequivocally limits the 
State's waiver of sovereign immunity for non-medical torts to 
actions "begun within two years after the claim accrues[.]" The statute makes no provision for waiver of the two-year period. The executive branch cannot unilaterally broaden the statutory waiver beyond the two-year limitation period, after which non-
8 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
medical tort claims are unequivocally "forever barred[.]" Nor 
does HRS § 662-4 make any provision for tolling. Whittington v. 
State, 72 Haw. 77, 78, 806 P.2d 957, 957 (1991). Accordingly, the HRS § 662-4 two-year limitation on the State's relinquishment of sovereign immunity against liability for non-medical tort claims is not subject to waiver by, or equitable tolling based upon conduct of, the executive branch. 
C. Judicial precedent indicates that the
legislature did not intend that the statuteof limitations could be waived by, or tolledby acts or omissions of, the executivebranch. 
In 1898, the Supreme Court of the Republic of Hawai# i 
considered Act 26
 of the Laws of the Republic (1895).8 Act 26 
provided, in relevant part: 
Every claim against this Government, cognizable asaforesaid, shall be forever barred unless the petitionsetting forth a statement thereof is filed in the Court, ortransmitted to it by the Secretary of the Senate or theClerk of the House of Representatives, as provided by law,within two years after the claim first accrues. 
W.C. Peacock & Co., 11 Haw. at 407 (quoting 1895 Laws of the 
Republic Act 26, § 5. The plaintiff in W.C. Peacock & Co. sought recovery of customs duties paid under protest from February 11, 1893, to January 8, 1894. Suit was filed on April 29, 1897 (more than two years after the last payment). The supreme court raised the statute of limitations issue sua sponte. The attorney general stated that the statute of limitations had been waived. Id. But the supreme court held that the statute of limitations 
couldn't be waived by the executive branch because "the Legislature alone had authority to determine what actions may or may not be brought against the Government . . . the Legislature being the proper mouth-piece of the State in matters of this 
8 Act 26 and its progeny did not afford a remedy for tort claims
against the government. See Meyer v. Territory of Hawaii, 36 Haw. 75, 77-78
(Haw. Terr. 1942) (applying RLH § 4420 (1935)). 
9 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
kind." Id.
 at 405. The court explained: 
In this respect an action against the Government
differs from an action against a private person. There is 
no right to sue the State except so far as permitted by theState, and if the State has permitted actions to be brought
against it only within a certain time, the court should notentertain an action brought after the expiration of thattime . But an action may be brought against a private person
and the court may entertain it without special permission
from the State through its Legislature [] — the statute
limiting this right being merely a defense which thedefendant may insist on or waive at his pleasure. 
Id. at 406 (emphasis added) (citation omitted); Cf. Kinney v. 
Territory of Hawaii, 34 Haw. 213, 214-15 (Haw. Terr. 1937) (holding that legislature waived statute of limitations, RLH Chapter 127 § 4424 (1935), by enacting specific legislation allowing plaintiffs to pursue lawsuit against Territory more than two years after their claim had accrued, as found by trial court). 
Act 26 was amended and codified as § 1534 of Chapter 98 
("Suits by and Against the Hawaiian Government") of The Civil Laws of the Hawaiian Islands (1897). The statute, as amended, retained the "shall be forever barred" language: 
Every claim against this Government, cognizable as
aforesaid, shall be forever barred unless the petitionsetting forth a statement thereof is filed in the Court, ortransmitted to it by the Secretary of the Senate or theClerk of the House of Representatives, as provided by law,within two years after the claim first accrues. Provided,that the claims of persons under legal disability shall notbe barred if the petition be filed in the Court ortransmitted, as aforesaid, within one year after thedisability has ceased. 
The statute was recodified as § 2004 of Chapter 129 
("Suits by and Against the Government") of the Revised Laws of 
Hawaii (1905), with non-substantive changes; the "shall be forever barred" language was again retained. The statute was recodified several more times, each time retaining the "shall be forever barred" language used in Act 26. See RLH Chapter 148 
§ 2667 (1915); RLH Chapter 152 § 2673 (1925); RLH Chapter 127 § 4424 (1935); RLH Chapter 220 § 10479 (1945); RLH § 245-5 
10 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(1955); HRS § 661-5 (1976). 
The statute currently reads: 
§661-5 Limitations on action . Every claim against the
State, cognizable under this part, shall be forever barred
unless the action is commenced within two years after theclaim first accrues; provided that the claims of personsunder legal disability shall not be barred if the action iscommenced within one year after the disability has ceased. 
HRS § 661-5 (2016). 
When the legislature enacted the TTLA in 1957, it used 
the same "shall be forever barred" language as the statute of 
limitations governing contract claims against the Territory, RLH § 245A-4 (Supp. 1957), which the Supreme Court of the Republic of Hawaii held to be jurisdictional in Peacock, 11 Haw. at 405-06. The legislature is presumed to know the law, including the supreme court's interpretations of statutory language, when enacting or amending statutes. State v. Casugay-Badiang, 130 
Hawai# i 21, 27, 305 P.3d 437, 443 (2013) (first quoting State v. 
Reis, 115 Hawai# i 79, 97, 165 P.3d 980, 998 (2007); and then 
citing Territory of Hawaii v. Ota, 36 Haw. 80, 98–99 (Haw. Terr. 1942) ("While . . . legislative inaction does not amount to legislative construction, it does indicate a lack of active disagreement with [judicial interpretation] . . . . [L]egislative inaction tends to indicate agreement.")). Where the legislature fails to act in response to the supreme court's statutory interpretation, that statutory interpretation must be considered to have the legislature's tacit approval. See, e.g., 
State v. Hussein, 122 Hawai# i 495, 529, 229 P.3d 313, 347 (2010) 
(citing Gray v. Admin. Dir. of the Cts., 84 Hawai# i 138, 143 n.9, 
931 P.2d 580, 585 n.9 (1997)); State v. Dannenberg, 74 Haw. 75, 83, 837 P.2d 776, 780 (1992), superseded by statute on other grounds, 1993 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 130, § 1 at 183-84, as recognized in State v. Klie, 116 Hawai# i 519, 174 P.3d 358 
(2007). 
The legislature's use of the "shall be forever barred" 
language in the HRS Chapter 662 statute of limitations indicates the legislature's agreement that only it can extend the statute of limitations applicable to tort claims against the State. 
11 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
D. Under the analogous Federal Tort Claims Act,
the "shall be forever barred" statute of limitations is jurisdictional and cannot bewaived. 
The STLA is modeled on the Federal Tort Claims Act, 
(
FTCA), 28 U.S.C. §§ 1346(b), 1402(b), 2401(b), 2671-2680. Doe 
Parents No. 1 v. State Dep't of Educ., 100 Hawai# i 34, 59, 58 
P.3d 545, 570 (2002). 
Accordingly, we may turn to federal case 
law construing the FTCA for guidance in construing the STLA. Id. 
at 59–60, 58 P.3d at 570–71. 
The FTCA's statute of limitations is materially 
identical to that of the STLA: 
A tort claim against the United States shall be forever 
barred  unless it is presented in writing to the appropriate
Federal agency within two years after such claim accrues orunless action is begun within six months after the date ofmailing, by certified or registered mail, of notice of finaldenial of the claim by the agency to which it was presented. 
28 U.S.C. § 2401(b) (2012) (emphasis added). 
As of 1976, when the STLA statute of limitations was 
last amended, federal courts enforced the FTCA's statute of 
limitations as a jurisdictional requirement. See, e.g., 
Humphreys v. United States, 272 F.2d 411, 412 (9th Cir. 1959) (holding "the District Court has no jurisdiction over [an untimely FTCA] action" "once the two-year period of limitations has run.") (citing Edwards v. United States, 163 F.2d 268, 269 (9th Cir. 1947); Simon v. United States, 244 F.2d 703, 705 & n.4 (5th Cir. 1957) (holding the FTCA's filing deadline is a jurisdictional condition on the Act's waiver of sovereign immunity) (citing Carpenter v. United States, 56 F.2d 828, 829 (2d Cir. 1932)); Anderegg v. United States, 171 F.2d 127, 128 (4th Cir. 1948), cert. denied, 336 U.S. 967, 69 S. Ct. 937 (Mem.), 93 L. Ed. 1118 (1949) (holding that the FTCA's filing deadline is a jurisdictional limit that the Government cannot waive) (first citing Munro v. United States, 303 U.S. 36, 41, 58 S. Ct. 421, 82 L. Ed. 633 (1938); and then citing Finn v. United States, 123 U.S. 227, 233, 8 S. Ct. 82, 31 L. Ed. 128 (1887)). 
12 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
This is further indication that the legislature didn't intend 
that the STLA statute of limitations be subject to waiver by, or equitable tolling by conduct of, the executive branch. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
The State Tort Liability Act statute of limitations, 
HRS § 662-4, cannot be waived by, or tolled by conduct of, the executive branch. If a lawsuit asserting a non-medical tort claim against the State is filed more than two years after the claim accrued, state courts have no subject matter jurisdiction over the claim. There was no dispute that Okutsu's lawsuit was filed more than two years after his tort claim accrued. Accordingly, the circuit court did not err by granting the State's motion to dismiss. We affirm the Final Judgment entered by the circuit court on May 16, 2018.
