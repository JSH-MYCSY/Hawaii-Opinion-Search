IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
MATTHEW CLEMENT, Petitioner-Appellant,
v.
STATE OF HAWAI #I, Respondent-Appellee.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(S.P.P. NO. 16-1-0008 (CR. NO. 1PC990000376))
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Chan, JJ.)
Upon review of the record in CAAP-17-0000736, it
appears this court lacks appellate jurisdiction because
Petitioner-Appellant Matthew Clement (Appellant) did not timely
file a Notice of Appeal, in accordance with Rule 4(b) of the
Hawai#i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP).
Appellant appeals from the Order Denying Petition to
Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner
from Custody (Order), filed on September 8, 2017, in the Circuit
Court of the First Circuit (circuit court).1 
"Any party may appeal from a judgment entered in the
proceeding in accordance with Rule 4(b) of the Hawai# i Rules of
Appellate Procedure."  Hawai# i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP)
Rule 40(h).  "According to HRPP Rule 40(h), appeals from
proceedings for post-conviction relief may be made from a

envelope dated October 6, 2017, from the circuit court to Appellant,
suggesting that the Order was not mailed to Appellant until that date.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
judgment entered in the proceeding and must be taken in
accordance with [HRAP] Rule 4(b)[.]"   Grattafiori v. State, 79
Hawai#i 10, 13, 897 P.2d 937, 940 (1995) (internal quotation
marks and brackets omitted).
HRAP Rule 4(b)(1) requires that "the notice of appeal
shall be filed within 30 days after entry of the judgment or
order appealed from."  (Emphasis added).  The rule does not
measure the notice of appeal deadline from the date the order is
served.
The Order and Notice of Entry were filed on 
September 8, 2017.  Even if Appellant's Notice of Appeal is
considered filed on the date he tendered it to prison officials
on October 12, 2017,  Setala v. J.C. Penney Company , 97 Hawai #i
484, 485, 40 P.3d 886, 887 (2002), it was filed more than 30 days
after entry of the order appealed from.  Thus, the Notice of
Appeal was untimely filed.  
 "We have, on a number of occasions, recognized
exceptions to the requirement that notices of appeal be timely
filed."  Grattafiori , 79 Hawai #i at 13, 897 P.2d at 940 (citation
omitted).  "Specifically, we have permitted belated appeals under
two sets of circumstances, namely, when (1) defense counsel has
inexcusably or ineffectively failed to pursue a defendant’s
appeal from a criminal conviction in the first instance, or 
(2) the lower court’s decision was unannounced and no notice of
the entry of judgment was ever provided."   Id. at 13-14, 897 P.2d
at 940-41.  Neither exception applies in this case.  
"[C]ompliance with the requirement of the timely filing
of a notice of appeal is jurisdictional."   State v. Brandimart,
68 Haw. 495, 497, 720 P.2d 1009, 1010 (1986).  Thus, "We must
dismiss an appeal on our own motion if we lack jurisdiction." 
Id. (citation omitted).
