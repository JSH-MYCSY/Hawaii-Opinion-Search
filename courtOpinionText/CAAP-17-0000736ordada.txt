IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
MATTHEW CLEMENT, Petitioner-Appellant,
v.
STATE OF HAWAI#I, Respondent-Appellee
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(S.P.P. NO. 16-1-0008)
ORDER
(By:  Hiraoka, J., for the court )1
Upon review of the (1) letter dated February 10, 2020
(JIMS record on appeal docket no. 96), (2) letter dated
February 12, 2020 (JIMS record on appeal docket no. 96),
(3) letter dated February 18, 2020 (JIMS record on appeal docket
no. 96), (4) ex parte motion to allow late filing of motion for
reconsideration and motion for reconsideration of summary
disposition order (JIMS record on appeal docket no. 98), and
(5) ex parte motion for appointment of counsel (JIMS record on
appeal docket no. 100), and supporting documents, all filed by
self-represented Petitioner-Appellant Matthew Clement ( Clement)
on February 21, 2020, and the record, it appears that:
1.Our summary disposition order was served upon
Clement by mail on January 30, 2020, making any motion for
reconsideration by Clement due on Tuesday, February 11, 2020, see
Hawai#i Rules of Appellate Procedure ( HRAP) Rules 26(c) and
40(a);
1Leonard, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.2.Clement tendered his motion for reconsideration to
prison officials on February 10, 2020, but it was returned to him
and not forwarded to the appellate clerk's office;
3.Clement retendered his motion for reconsideration
to prison officials on February 13, 2020, but it was again
returned to him and not forwarded to the appellate clerk's
office;
4.Clement again tendered his motion for reconsidera-
tion to prison officials on February 18, 2020, and it was then
forwarded to the appellate clerk's office and filed on
February 21, 2020;
5.Under Hawai# i law, a self-represented prisoner's
document is deemed filed on the day it is tendered to prison
officials.  See Fagaragan v. State, 132 Hawai#i 224, 236, 320
P.3d 889, 901 (2014) (citing Setala v. J.C. Penney Co., 97
Hawai#i 484, 40 P.3d 886 (2002));
6.We did not overlook or misapprehend any points of
law or fact when we entered the January 30, 2020 Summary
Disposition Order;
7.The underlying petition is one for post-conviction
collateral remedy, pursuant to HRAP Rule 40;
8.The constitutional right to counsel does not
extend to post-conviction challenges.  Engstrom v. Naauao, 51
Haw. 318, 321, 459 P.2d 376, 378 (1969) (Engstrom); see also
State v. Levi, 102 Hawai'i 282, 288, 75 P.3d 1173, 1179 (2003);
and
9.Clement's intended petition for writ of certiorari
does not raise "substantial issues which require marshalling of
evidence and logical presentation of contentions" that might
warrant discretionary appointment of counsel.  See Engstrom, 51
Haw. at 321, 459 P.2d at 378 (citations omitted).
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:
1.Clement's motion to allow late filing of motion
for reconsideration is denied as unnecessary because Clement's
motion for reconsideration was timely tendered to prison
officials on February 10, 2020;
22.Clement's motion for reconsideration of our
January 30, 2020 Summary Disposition Order is denied; and
3.Clement's motion for appointment of counsel is
denied without prejudice to Clement's right to petition the
circuit court for appointment of counsel on remand.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, February 28, 2020.
