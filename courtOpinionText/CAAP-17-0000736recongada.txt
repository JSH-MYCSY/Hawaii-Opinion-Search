MATTHEW CLEMENT, Petitioner-Appellant,
v.
STATE OF HAWAI #I, Respondent-Appellee.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(S.P.P. NO. 16-1-0008 (CR. NO. 1PC990000376)
ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
OF THE JUNE 25, 2018 ORDER DISMISSING
APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Chan, JJ.)
Upon consideration of the "[Hawaii Rules of Penal
Procedure (HRPP)] Rule 40 Motion for Reconsideration of Order
Dismissing Appeal for Lack of Appellate Jurisdiction in Appeal
from the Order Denying Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct
Judgment or to Release Petitioner from Custody, Filed September
8, 2017" (Motion for Reconsideration), filed on July 9, 2018, by
Petitioner-Appellant Matthew Clement (Appellant), we hereby grant
Appellant's motion.#
The Hawai #i Supreme Court has
on a number of occasions, recognized exceptions to the
requirement that notices of appeal be timely filed . . . .
Specifically, [the court has] permitted belated appeals
under two sets of circumstances, namely, when (1) defense
counsel has inexcusably or ineffectively failed to pursue a
defendant's appeal from a criminal conviction in the first
instance, or (2) the lower court's decision was unannounced
and no notice of the entry of judgment was ever provided.Grattafiori v. State of Hawai #i, 79 Hawai #i 10, 13-14, 897 P.2d
937, 940-41 (1995) (citing State v. Caraballo , 62 Haw. 309, 
315-16, 615 P.2d 91, 96 (1980)).
The facts of this case do not satisfy the first of the
Grattafiori  exceptions noted above, but, as to the second
exception, we observe no practical difference in terms of
facilitating or making possible a timely notice of appeal between
the case in which notice of entry of judgment was not "ever
provided" and the case where notice was not mailed until 
twenty-eight days after entry and apparently not received by
Appellant until thirty-two days after entry.  If the absolute
failure to provide notice creates an exception to the thirty-day
rule in Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure 4(b)(1), then the
same exception applies when the notice was not delivered until
thirty-two days after-the-fact.  See Rosenbloom v. United States,
355 U.S. 80 (1957); State v. Ferreira, 59 Haw. 255, 580 P.2d 63
(1978); State v. Delaney , 56 Haw. 444, 540 P.2d 61 (1975).  In
either case, it was impractical, if not impossible, for
Appellant, a pro se HRPP Rule 40 petitioner in prison, to timely
file his notice of appeal.  Cf. Reed v. Hawai# i Paroling
Authority, No. CAAP-13-0000159, 2013 WL 3957748, *2 (Hawai# i App.
Aug. 1, 2013) (holding that the second Grattafiori exception did
not apply when court mailed a copy of the order to the
petitioner's attorney one day after entry of the order).
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion for
Reconsideration is granted, the order dismissing the appeal is
rescinded, and the appeal is reinstated.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, August 2, 2018.
