IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
MATTHEW CLEMENT, Petitioner-Appellant,
v.
STATE OF HAWAI#I, Respondent-Appellee
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(S.P.P. NO. 16-1-0008)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Leonard, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.)
Petitioner-Appellant Matthew Clement (Clement )
allegedly broke into Eleanor Wimberly's home and killed her by
shooting her in the head and chest with a handgun at close range. 
He was charged with murder in the second degree, burglary in the
first degree, and place to keep pistol or revolver.  A jury found
him guilty as charged.  On July 18, 2000, the Circuit Court of
the First Circuit  sentenced him to life in prison with the
possibility of parole on the murder count and ten years each on
the burglary and firearms counts, to be served concurrently.1
On December 20, 2000, the Hawaii Paroling Authority
(HPA) fixed Clement's minimum terms of imprisonment at 40 years
on the murder count and 10 years on each of the burglary and
firearms counts.   However, the HPA granted Clement a new minimum2

term hearing based on Coulter v. State, 116 Hawai#i 181, 172 P.3d
493 (2007) (holding that an HPA minimum term decision that did
not specify the level of punishment or significant criteria upon
which the decision was based violated HPA Guidelines established
pursuant to HRS § 706-669(8)).  The new hearing was held on
January 28, 2014.  An amended order specifying Level III
punishment and fixing a minimum term of 25 years on the murder
count, to expire on March 3, 2024, was issued on January 28, 2014
(Minimum Term Order ).3
On May 11, 2016, a self-represented Clement filed a
petition pursuant to Rule 40 of the Hawai#i Rules of Penal
Procedure (HRPP ) (Rule 40 Petition ) challenging the Minimum Term
Order.  On September 8, 2017, the circuit court  denied the
petition without a hearing ( Rule 40 Denial Order ).  Clement filed
this appeal.4
The issue presented by this appeal is whether Clement's
Rule 40 Petition alleged facts which, if proven, would entitle
Clement to relief.  We hold that the circuit court erred in
finding "[Clement]'s claims to be patently frivolous and . . .
without trace of support either in the record or from other
evidence submitted by [Clement]."  Accordingly, we vacate the
Rule 40 Denial Order and remand to the circuit court for further
proceedings.
I.
An HRPP Rule 40 petition is the appropriate means to
challenge a minimum term of imprisonment set by the HPA.  De La
Garza v. State, 129 Hawai#i 429, 438, 302 P.3d 697, 706 (2013). 
HRPP Rule 40 (eff. 2006) provides, in relevant part:
(f) Hearings .  If a petition alleges facts that if
proven would entitle the petitioner to relief, the court

shall grant a hearing which may extend only to the issues
raised in the petition or answer.  However, the court may
deny a hearing if the petitioner's claim is patently
frivolous and is without trace of support either in the
record or from other evidence submitted by the petitioner. 
The court may also deny a hearing on a specific question of
fact when a full and fair evidentiary hearing upon that
question was held during the course of the proceedings which
led to the judgment or custody which is the subject of the
petition or at any later proceeding.
The petitioner shall have a full and fair evidentiary
hearing on the petition.  The court shall receive all
evidence that is relevant and necessary to determine the
petition, including affidavits, depositions, oral testimony,
certificate of any judge who presided at any hearing during
the course of the proceedings which led to the judgment or
custody which is the subject of the petition, and relevant
and necessary portions of transcripts of prior proceedings. 
The petitioner shall have a right to be present at any
evidentiary hearing at which a material question of fact is
litigated.
Orders denying HRPP Rule 40 petitions are reviewed de novo.  
Lewi v. State, 145 Hawai#i 333, 345, 452 P.3d 330, 342 (2019). 
"The question on appeal of a denial of a Rule 40 petition without
a hearing is whether the trial record indicates that Petitioner's
application for relief made such a showing of a colorable claim
as to require a hearing before the lower court."  Id. (citation
omitted).
II.
Clement's opening brief raises seven points of error,
which we have reorganized and partially consolidated.
A. The presentence detention credit issue is moot.
Clement contends that his claim that the HPA's Minimum
Term Order failed to credit him with time spent in presentence
detention was not patently frivolous and was supported in the
record and by other evidence submitted by him.  We have taken
judicial notice, pursuant to Hawaii Rules of Evidence ( HRE)
Rule 201, that on April 25, 2018 (while this appeal was pending),
the HPA issued another amended order that adjusted the minimum
term expiration date for the murder conviction to January 31,
2024 (from March 3, 2024), based upon the "amended Pre Sentence
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Credits from the Department of Public Safety, which has caused
minimum and maximum sentences to be adjusted."  Because Clement
has now received credit for time served, his appeal from that
issue is moot.  Lewi, 145 Hawai#i at 346, 452 P.3d at 343.
B. The HRPP Rule 40 Petition stated a colorable claim
that Clement was denied due process before the
HPA.
The HPA is obligated to comply with the due process
clause of the Hawai#i Constitution in determining minimum terms
of imprisonment.  De La Garza, 129 Hawai#i at 439, 302 P.3d at
707.  "[D]ue process . . . requires that the prisoner have timely
access to all of the adverse information contained in the HPA
file."  Id. at 442, 302 P.3d at 710.
Clement contends that he was not provided with the
adverse information contained in HPA's file before the 2014
minimum term hearing.  That contention is without merit because
the attorney who represented Clement in the original 2000 minimum
term hearing was provided with copies of those documents before
that hearing.
Clement contends that he was not provided with the
State's Partial Presentence Diagnosis and Report, dated
February 17, 2000, before the 2014 minimum term hearing.  That
contention is also without merit because Clement's attorney was
provided with a copy of the document.5
Clement contends that in 2014 the HPA considered a
letter from the Department of the Prosecuting Attorney, dated
July 19, 2000, containing adverse information, that was produced
for the first time during the 2014 minimum term hearing by the
deputy prosecuting attorney handling the hearing.  Clement
contends the letter was not provided to his attorney at any point
before the 2000 minimum term hearing or the 2014 minimum term
hearing.  Clement had "'a right to disclosure of adverse
5Clement's contention that he was deprived of effective assistance
of counsel because his attorney refused to give him a copy of the presentence
report is addressed below.
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
materials' in preparation for [his] minimum term hearing, so that
'[he] is given reasonable notice and a meaningful opportunity to
be heard on the issue of the minimum term.'"  Lewi, 145 Hawai#i
at 349, 452 P.3d at 346 (citations omitted).  Clement states a
colorable claim for relief that entitles him to a hearing on that
issue raised in his Rule 40 Petition.  The circuit court's
finding that the claim was patently frivolous and without trace
of support either in the record or from other evidence submitted
by Clement was clearly erroneous.6
Finally, Clement contends that HPA arbitrarily and
capriciously determined that he was a Level III offender and
fixed a minimum term of 25 years on the murder count, because it
failed to adequately consider all of the relevant factors.  The
Minimum Term Order issued on January 28, 2014, stated:
Level of Punishment: Level III.
Significant factors identified in determining level of
punishment:
(1) Nature of Offense; (2)  Character and Attitude of
Offender with Respect to Criminal Activity or Lifestyle;
(3) Involvement of Offender in Instant Offense.
On November 7, 2019, the Hawai#i Supreme Court decided Lewi and
held:
[T]he HPA is required to set forth a written justification
or explanation (beyond simply an enumeration of any or all
of the broad criteria considered) when it determines that
the minimum term of imprisonment for the felony offender is
to be set at a Level II or Level III punishment.
145 Hawai#i at 348-49, 452 P.3d at 345-46.  Lewi had not been
decided when the circuit court entered the Rule 40 Denial Order. 
The supreme court's opinion directed that the new rule
established by Lewi be applied to all cases that were on direct
review or not yet final as of November 7, 2019.  Id. at 349 n.21,
452 P.3d at 346 n.21.  Lewi applies to this case because we are
directly reviewing Clement's appeal from the minimum term of
6Clement's contention that he was also deprived of effective
assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to request a continuance of

5NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
imprisonment set by the HPA, and our review was not final as of
November 7, 2019.  Accordingly, we remand for the circuit court
to determine whether the 2014 Minimum Term Order complied with
the rule established by Lewi.
Because we remand this case for a hearing on certain
issues in Clement's Rule 40 Petition, we need not address
Clement's additional contention that he was denied due process.
C. Clement did not serve the Rule 40 Petition upon
the counsel whose assistance is alleged to have
been ineffective.
Clement contends that the lawyer who represented him
during the 2014 minimum term hearing (Harriet Ilima Morrison ) was
ineffective because she refused to give him a copy of the State's
Partial Presentence Diagnosis and Report, and because she failed
to request a continuance of the hearing upon receiving for the
first time a copy of the letter from the Department of the
Prosecuting Attorney, dated July 19, 2000, that contained
additional information adverse to Clement.  HRPP Rule 40(f)
provides, in relevant part:
Where the petition alleges the ineffective assistance
of counsel as a ground upon which the requested relief
should be granted, the petitioner shall serve written notice
of the hearing upon the counsel whose assistance is alleged
to have been ineffective and said counsel shall have an
opportunity to be heard.
The record contains no indication that Clement served Morrison
with his Rule 40 Petition.  Should Clement desire to pursue his
claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on remand, he must
serve Morrison with copies of all relevant documents so that she
may have an opportunity to be heard.
III.
Based upon the foregoing, the Rule 40 Denial Order
entered by the circuit court on September 8, 2017, is vacated.
On remand, the circuit court should conduct a hearing
on Clement's Rule 40 Petition to determine whether Clement was
6NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
denied due process in connection with the HPA's 2014 minimum term
hearing and, if Clement fully complies with HRPP Rule 40(f),
whether Clement received ineffective assistance of counsel in
connection with the 2014 minimum term hearing.
