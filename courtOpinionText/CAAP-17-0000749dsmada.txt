NO. CAAP-17-0000749
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
 
KAMAHAO HOLZGROVE, Defendant-Appellee.
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 3FFC-17-0000181)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Chan, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record in this appeal, and the 
record in the underlying family-court criminal case, case number 
3FFC-17-0000181, it appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction over Plaintiff-Appellant State of Hawai' i's (State's) appeal from 
the Family Court of the Third Circuit's (family court's) 
September 26, 2017 "Order Granting in Part, Denying in Part, 
State's Motion to Modify Terms of Probation" (Order), under 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-13(6). 
"The right to an appeal is strictly statutory." State
 
v. Ontiveros, 82 Hawai' i 446, 449, 923 P.2d 388, 391 (1996) 
(citation omitted). HRS § 571-54 (2006) provides that "[a]n 
interested party aggrieved by any order or decree of the court may appeal to the intermediate appellate court for review of questions of law and fact upon the same terms and conditions as in other cases in the family court and review shall be governed by chapter 602[.]" HRS § 602-57(1) (2016) states that the NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
intermediate court of appeals has jurisdiction "[t]o hear and
 
determine appeals from any court . . . when appeals are allowed
 by law[.]" 
HRS § 641-13(6) does not apply to authorize the appeal. 
§ 641-13(6) (2016) provides that the State may appeal, in any
 criminal case, "[f]rom the sentence, on the ground that it is
 illegal." An illegal sentence is one "which the court is not
 authorized to impose." State v. Kahalewai, 71 Haw. 624, 625, 
801 P.2d 558, 560 (1990). The May 24, 2017 Judgment entered by
 the family court was authorized by HRS § 706-605(7) (2006). 
Therefore, the Judgment was not illegal.
 
In any event, the State's October 25, 2017 Notice of 
Appeal (Notice of Appeal) was not filed within thirty days after entry of the May 24, 2017 Judgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence, and no tolling, or other motion to extend the time to file the Notice of Appeal appears in the record. Therefore, the Notice of Appeal is untimely as to the Judgment. See 
Rule 4(b)(1) of the Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure. 
"The Prosecution's right of appeal in criminal cases is 
limited to those instances set forth in HRS § 641-13." State v. 
Fukusaku, 85 Hawai' i 462, 490, 946 P.2d 32, 60 (1997) (citations, 
internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted). No other subsection of HRS § 641-13 authorizes the appeal. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal in case
 
number CAAP-17-0000749 is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
