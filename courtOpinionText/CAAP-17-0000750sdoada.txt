KATHLEEN ANN EISENBREY, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. FC-M No. 15-1-0005) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: 
Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Kathleen Ann Eisenbrey appeals from 
a number of orders entered by the Family Court of the First 
Circuit.1 In CAAP-17-0000750, we have jurisdiction over 
Kathleen's appeal from the order granting Plaintiff-AppelleeDavid Bradley Eisenbrey's motion to expunge lis pendens, entered 
on July 12, 2017 (Order Expunging Lis Pendens), and the order 
awarding David attorney's fees and costs, entered on 
September 26, 2017 (Order Awarding Fees and Costs). In CAAP–18-
0000092, we have jurisdiction over Kathleen's appeal from the 
1 The Honorable Gale L.F. Ching presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
order denying her December 1, 2017 Hawai# i Family Court Rules 
(
HFCR) Rule 60(b) motion, entered on February 9, 2018 (Order 
Denying Rule 60(b) Motion). We consolidated the appeals. 
For the reasons explained below, we dismiss Kathleen's 
appeal from the Order Expunging Lis Pendens; affirm in part and 
vacate in part the Order Awarding Fees and Costs, and remand to the family court for redetermination or clarification; and affirm the Order Denying Rule 60(b) Motion. 
David and Kathleen were married. They were divorced in 
Michigan. 
David initiated the action below by filing an 
exemplified copy of the Michigan Divorce Decree with the family 
court pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statute (HRS) § 636C-3.2 
David and Kathleen owned real property in Kailua, 
Hawai#i (the Kailua Property). The Divorce Decree provided: 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the [Kailua
Property] shall be sold at a price mutually agreed upon. If 
the parties do not agree to a sales price then the partiesagree to accept as the sales price the amount recommended bythe listing agent. Any proceeds from the sale will beretained by [Kathleen]. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that until the 
[Kailua Property] is sold, [Kathleen] shall be entitled toexclusive use of this property, subject to [Kathleen] payingall utilities, maintenance and upkeep of the parties. The monthly mortgage installments that include real propertytaxes and insurance paid to Wells Fargo Mortgage shall bepaid equally by [David] and [Kathleen] in the same manner aspast practice. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that until sold,
the parties shall maintain ownership of this property, byQuit Claim Deed, as Tenants in common. 
David moved for "[a]n order that the Kailua [P]roperty 
be sold immediately, as set out in the Divorce Decree filed 
herein, to avoid foreclosure, and that the amounts that [David] has paid to maintain the property that were ordered to be paid by [Kathleen] be reimbursed to him out of the proceeds of the sale 
2 The statute is part of the Hawai #i Uniform Enforcement of Foreign
Judgments Act.

before they are distributed." The family court granted David's 
motion. 
Kathleen refused to comply with the order. David filed 
a motion to enforce the order, in which he requested an award of attorney's fees. The family court granted David's motion to enforce. 
Kathleen filed a notice of lis pendens on May 23, 2017. 
The lis pendens was recorded in the Bureau of Conveyances on May 24, 2017. David filed a motion to expunge the lis pendens. The Order Expunging Lis Pendens was entered on July 12, 2017. The Order Awarding Fees and Costs was entered on September 26, 2017. Kathleen also filed a motion for relief under HFCR Rule 60(b) (Rule 60(b) Motion). The Order Denying Rule 60(b) 
Motion was entered on February 9, 2018. These appeals followed.
3 
Kathleen contends that the family court erred by:
(1) granting David's motion to expunge lis pendens; (2) awarding 
David attorney's fees and costs incurred on his motion to 
expunge; and (3) denying Kathleen's Rule 60(b) Motion.
(1) The record indicates that the Kailua Property was 
sold and the proceeds distributed in 2017. The sale renders the appeal from the Order Expunging Lis Pendens moot. Lathrop v. 
Sakatani, 111 Hawai# i 307, 313, 141 P.3d 480, 486 (2006). None 
of the recognized exceptions to the mootness doctrine apply here. See Hamilton ex rel. Lethem v. Lethem, 119 Hawai# i 1, 5-11, 193 
P.3d 839, 843-49 
(2008) (discussing the "capable of repetition, 
yet evading review" and "public interest" exceptions and adopting the "collateral consequences" exception). Accordingly, we dismiss Kathleen's appeal from the Order Expunging Lis Pendens as moot. 
(2) Although Kathleen's appeal from the Order 
Expunging Lis Pendens is moot, her appeal from the Order Awarding 
3 Kathleen has taken two other appeals from the case below, which
have been dismissed. See Order Dismissing the Appeal, Eisenbrey v. Eisenbrey,
No. CAAP-16-0000638 (Haw. App. Mar. 14, 2017), JIMS No. 30; Order Dismissing
Appeal, Eisenbrey v. Eisenbrey, No. CAAP-17-0000444 (Haw. App. Oct. 11, 2017),JIMS No. 20.

Fees and Costs is not. Queen Emma Found. v. Tatibouet, 123 
Hawai#i 500, 510, 236 P.3d 1236, 1246 (2010) ("[A]lthough a claim 
for attorney's fees does not preserve a case which has otherwise 
become moot on appeal, . . . the question of attorney's fees is ancillary to the underlying action and survives independently under the Court's equitable jurisdiction.") (citations omitted). We review an award of attorney's fees and costs for abuse of discretion. Kamaka v. Goodsill Anderson Quinn & Stifel, 117 
Hawai#i 92, 105, 176 P.3d 91, 104 (2008). The same standard 
applies to our review of the amount of a trial court's award of attorney's fees. Chun v. Bd. of Trs. of the Emps. Ret. Sys. of 
Haw., 106 Hawai# i 416, 431, 106 P.3d 339, 354 (2005).
(a) Kathleen argues that David was not entitled to an 
award of attorney's fees and costs because the family court erred by granting David's motion to expunge. The record indicates that Kathleen did not file a memorandum in opposition to David's motion to expunge, nor did she argue against the motion during the hearing. Her argument that the family court erred by granting David's motion to expunge was waived. Haw. Ventures, 
LLC v. Otaka, Inc., 114 Hawai# i 438, 500, 164 P.3d 696, 758 
(2007) (noting general rule that arguments not made in the trial court will be deemed to have been waived on appeal). 
Kathleen argues that the family court failed to 
consider the factors set forth in HRS § 580-47(f) in awarding David attorney's fees and costs. David's request for fees and costs was part of his motion to expunge. Kathleen did not file a memorandum in opposition, nor did she argue the HRS § 580-47(f) factors at the hearing on the motion. Her argument was waived. Otaka, Inc., 114 Hawai# i at 500, 164 P.3d at 758. 
Kathleen incorrectly argues that the only legal 
authority cited by the family court for awarding attorney's fees and costs was Hawai# i Family Court Rules (HFCR) Rule 54, which 
pertains to judgments and costs, but not attorney's fees. 
The 
family court cited Nakata v. Nakata
, 7 Haw. App. 636, 793 P.2d 
1219 (1990), in which we noted that "case law permits the 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
assessment of one party's attorney fees against the other party 
whose bad faith actions generated the attorney fees." Id. at 
638, 793 P.2d at 1221. The family court also cited TSA Int'l Ltd. v. Shimizu Corp., 92 Hawai# i 243, 990 P.2d 713 (1999), a 
case involving expungement of a lis pendens following an appeal. The family court found and concluded: 
FINDINGS OF FACT: 
1. [Kathleen] attempted to block and did delay the
listing and the sale of the [Kailua Property]throughout the above-captioned post-decreeproceedings, which commencemenced [sic] of [sic] onOctober 22, 2015, through the closing of the housesale August, 2017. 
. . . . 
4. A full-price offer was made on the [Kailua Property]in December 2016, and [David] signed the PurchaseContract but [Kathleen] refused to sign, in herrepeated attempts to thwart the sale of the [KailuaProperty]. 
5. [Kathleen] had been ordered to cooperate in the saleof the house, however, [Kathleen] stated in theCourtroom, by and through her attorney, that she wouldsign documents for the sale of the house, "over herdead body." 
This was at a hearing on February 15,
2017, brought on by [David's] MOTION TO ORDER THECHIEF CLERK OF COURTS TO SIGN PURCHASE CONTRACT ON BEHALF OF DEFENDANT AND FOR ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS filed February 10, 2017. 
6. [Kathleen] filed two appeals during the pendency ofthis post-decree case, both of which were dismissed bythe Intermediate Court of Appeals. 
7. After [Kathleen] filed her second appeal with the ICA,on May 24, 2017, she filed a Notice of Lis Pendens inthe Bureau of Conveyances, based on the filing of hersecond appeal in the above-captioned post-decreeaction. 
. . . . 
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 
. . . . 
10. In the Eisenbrey case, here, as in the 
TSA case,
[Kathleen]'s filing of a lis pendens on the [KailuaProperty] was [Kathleen]'s bad faith attempts toencumber the property and block the sale of the house. 
. . . . 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
12. Here, the Family Court issued many enforcement orders,
which [Kathleen] mostly defied, but the final outcomeis that [David] prevailed and the [Kailua Property]was under contract and scheduled to close in less than a month. The closing could not take place because ofthe cloud on the title, placed there by [Kathleen]'srecordation of the Notice of Lis Pendens on May 24,2017. 
13. At every turn, [Kathleen] has tried to block the saleof the [Kailua Property] and the filing of the Noticeof Lis Pendens is another such tactic. However [Kathleen]'s lis pendens is not supported by law.Here as in TSA, that [Kathleen] [(]"losing party")should be allowed to encumber the property simplybecause she has appealed from the judgment unfavorableto [Kathleen] is "untenable." Under these circumstances, it was proper for the Family Court ofthe First Circuit to exercise its power to enforce itsjudgment and grant [David]'s motion to expunge the lispendens. 
. . . . 
15. [Kathleen]'s bad faith actions of filing a 
lis pendens
based on her filing of an appeal, warrant theassessment of attorney fees as pointed-out in Nakata. If not for [Kathleen]'s bad faith action of filing anunauthorized lis pendens against the [KailuaProperty], [David] would not have incurred the chargesfor attorney fees and costs to file a motion, preparefor, and attend a hearing. 
16. As in Nakata, the Family Court here did not expresslystate that there was an act of bad faith, however,looking at the totality of the circumstances paints aseries of bad faith acts and contumacious behavior by[Kathleen] including her statement, in the courtroom,that she would cooperate and sign the documents "overher dead body". [sic] The award of attorney fees to[David] is proper, as it was in Nakata. 
The family court's findings of fact, and combined findings and 
conclusions, were supported by substantial evidence, and reflected an application of the correct rule of law. Est. of 
Klink ex rel. Klink v. State, 113 Hawai# i 332, 351, 152 P.3d 504, 
523 (2007). 
In addition, the family court made these findings in 
connection with other proceedings that are not challenged by 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Kathleen and are binding in this appeal, Okada Trucking Co. v. 
Bd. of Water Supply, 97 Hawai# i 450, 458, 40 P.3d 73, 81 (2002):4 
5. [Kathleen] refused to take any steps to sell the
[Kailua Property] despite [David]'s repeated emailsand other messages that the house must be sold. 
. . . . 
11. [David] contacted and lined-up a realtor to sell thehouse and the realtor was ready to list the houseSpring of 2015 but [Kathleen] refused to sign alisting agreement. 
. . . . 
16. The house has deteriorated over the past two yearswhile [Kathleen] refuses to co-operate in the sale ofthe house. 
There has been water damage to the ceiling
of the lanai; the pool equipment no longer works sothat the pool water is dirty and green; and generaldisrepair and lack of maintenance can be seen in thelandscaping and the house. 
17. [Kathleen] told this Court, at the hearing onFebruary 3, 2016, that she received insurance money tomake repairs on the water-damaged lanai roof and [she]spent the money on something other than repairing theroof. 
. . . . 
19. [Kathleen] refused to sign listing agreements eventhough she was ordered to do so at the March 16, 2016[hearing], and the house could not be listed on theMLS. 
. . . . 
22. [Kathleen] signed the listing Agreement on or aboutAugust 2, 2016, and the realtor, Francine Felix,listed the house . . . on the Multiple Listing Service("MLS"). 
However, [Kathleen] did not allow the
realtor to do a walk through which was scheduled forAugust 13, 2016, or to show the house. 
23. On August 14, 2016, [Kathleen] demanded that therealtor cancel the group showings realtor hadscheduled for the evening of August 15, 2016, and theafternoon of August 16, 2016. The realtor made no more appointments in August 2016, to show the housebecause [Kathleen] would not allow the realtor access.There was no "for sale" sign in front of the house. 
4 These findings are included in the "Findings of Fact and
Conclusions of Law Regarding Plaintiff's Motion and Declaration for Post-Decree Relief, Filed October 22, 2015[,]" entered by the family court onJanuary 9, 2017. 
7 . . . . NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
24. On August 31, 2016, in response to an offer on the
house, [Kathleen] demanded that the realtor, FrancineFelix, "cease and desist" and to "inactivate the MLSfor my property and remove my property from the realestate market." 
25. In August 2016, there were two offers made on thehouse, sight-unseen, contingent on home inspections.However, [Kathleen] would not let anyone see the houseor inspect the house. 
. . . . 
30. The Court ordered that [Kathleen] would be evictedfrom the house because she continued to defy theOrders of the Court that she cooperate with the saleof the house and she was, in fact, purposelyobstructing the sale of the house. [Kathleen] wasordered out of the house on or before the 16th of October, 2016. 
. . . . 
33. The realtor verified that one potential buyer had beenlost because of [Kathleen]'s refusal to cooperate. 
The family court also made these findings that are not 
challenged by Kathleen and are binding in this appeal: 5
2. [Kathleen] made twenty-one (21) pro se filings withthe Court from January 23, 2017, through June 16,2017. Many of [Kathleen]'s filings include numerouspages in the leading document and a multitude ofattachments. Some information is in the form of quotes and negative opinions regarding [David]'s or[David]'s attorney's character and positive quotes andopinions regarding her own character, all of which areirrelevant to the sale of the [Kailua Property], whichsale was ordered in the Judgment of Divorce, filedDecember 30, 2014, and which property sale is enforcedin the present action. 
3. [Kathleen] stated in the Courtroom, by and through herattorney, that she would sign documents for the saleof the house, "over her dead body." 
. . . . 
6. At the time of the hearing on May 05, 2017, there was
a full-price offer, Purchase Contract for the [KailuaProperty] signed by [David] and the Buyer and which[Kathleen] refused to sign. 
5 These findings are included in the "Findings of Fact and
Conclusions of Law for Orders Appealed By Defendant in CAAP-17-0000444Regarding Plaintiff's Motion For Post-Decree Relief, Filed October 22,2015[,]" entered by the family court on July 18, 2017. 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
13. On May 9, 2017, the Chief Clerk of Courts of the First
Circuit Court of the State of Hawai #i, signed the
Purchase Contract, on behalf of [Kathleen], for thesale of the [Kailua Property]. 
An Escrow Account was 
opened for the sale of the house, by Old RepublicTitle and Escrow, on or about May 12, 2017, and givenan escrow# 6812014016-CK. 
14. [Kathleen] has been presented with and refuses to signdocuments to move forward on the sale of the house,even though [Kathleen] has been ordered by the Courtto cooperate in the sale of the house and [David] hasfiled a Motion to have documents signed to move towardclosing on the house. 
15. [Kathleen] recorded a lis pendens
 against the [Kailua
Property], with the Bureau of Conveyances, on May 24,2017, as a measure to obstruct the sale of the house. 
On this record, we conclude that the family court did 
not abuse its discretion by granting David's request for 
attorney's fees and costs.
(b) Kathleen argues that the amount of fees and costs 
awarded — $5,217.77 — was excessive. The family court ordered that David's counsel submit a declaration supporting the amount of attorney's fees and costs requested. Counsel submitted a declaration and request for $5,217.77. Kathleen filed objections, arguing that some of the fees were not related to the motion to expunge, and that the amount charged was unreasonable. David contends that "[t]he Family Court properly found the attorney fees and costs were reasonable." But the family court found only that "[i]n her Declaration, Counsel for [David] stated the fees she charged were necessary in the action and were reasonably billed, considering the complexity of the issues and as compared with other attorneys in the area and in the practice of family law." The court made no finding that the amount of attorney's fees and costs requested were reasonable and necessarily incurred in connection with the motion to expunge, nor did it address Kathleen's objections. Accordingly, we remand for the family court to "specify the grounds for [the] award[] of attorneys' fees and the amounts awarded with respect to each ground." Price v. AIG Haw. Ins. Co., 107 Hawai# i 106, 113, 111 
P.3d 1, 8 (2005). 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(3) Kathleen argues that the family court erred by 
denying her Rule 60(b) Motion. HFCR Rule 60(b) provides, in 
relevant part: 
On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may
relieve a party or a party's legal representative from anyor all of the provisions of a final judgment, order, orproceeding for the following reasons: 
. . . . 
(3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic
or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other misconduct of anadverse party; 
(4)
 the judgment is void; [or] 
. . . . 
(6) any other reason justifying relief from the
operation of the judgment. 
We review the family court's order on a motion filed 
under HFCR Rule 60(b)(3) or (6) for abuse of discretion. LaPeter 
v. LaPeter, 144 Hawai# i 295, 304, 439 P.3d 247, 256 (App. 2019). 
We review an order on an HFCR Rule 60(b)(4) motion de novo under 
the right/wrong standard. See Cvitanovich-Dubie v. Dubie, 125 
Hawai#i 128, 139, 254 P.3d 439, 450 (2011).
(a) According to Kathleen's opening brief, the 
Rule 60(b) Motion requested relief from the family court order entered on January 11, 2017, that denied a motion for post-decree relief Kathleen had filed on December 9, 2016. The December 9, 2016 motion sought an order requiring that David pay half of the mortgage payments and half of the repairs for the Kailua Property. The January 11, 2017 order contained a finding that the December 9, 2016 motion was frivolous. 
Kathleen's Rule 60(b) Motion made no argument about the 
January 11, 2017 order. During the hearing on the Rule 60(b) Motion, Kathleen's counsel briefly mentioned David not making mortgage payments, but offered no argument about why Kathleen should be granted relief from the January 11, 2017 order under HFCR Rule 60(b). Kathleen's arguments, raised for the first time 
10 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
in her opening brief, are waived.6 Otaka, Inc., 114 Hawai# i at 
500, 164 P.3d at 758 . 
(b) Kathleen's Rule 60(b) Motion also sought relief 
from the family court's orders granting David's requests for 
attorney's fees, entered on November 25, 2016, March 21, 2017, and March 23, 2017. To the extent relief was sought under HFCR Rule 60(b)(3), the Rule 60(b) Motion failed to state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud, as required by HFCR Rule 60(b). HFCR Rule 60(b) ("For reason[] . . . (3) the averments in the motion shall be made in compliance with Rule 9(b) of these Rules."); HFCR Rule 9(b) ("In all averments of fraud . . . , the circumstances constituting fraud . . . shall be stated with particularity."). 
To the extent Kathleen sought relief under HFCR 
Rule 60(b)(4), she failed to establish that the family court orders at issue were void. See Cvitanovich-Dubie, 125 Hawai# i at 
141, 254 P.3d at 452 ("[A] judgment is void only if the court that rendered it lacked jurisdiction of either the subject matter or the parties or otherwise acted in a manner inconsistent with due process of law."). 
To the extent Kathleen sought relief under HFCR 
Rule 60(b)(6), the factual and legal arguments made in her Rule 60(b) Motion and her opening brief could have, and should have, been made in opposition to David's original fee requests. Tagupa, 108 Hawai# i at 465, 121 P.3d at 930. 
We conclude that the family court did not abuse its 
discretion or err on the law when it denied Kathleen's HFCR Rule 60(b) Motion. 
6 Kathleen's opening brief purports to recite the relevant
procedural history, but fails to mention that Kathleen filed an HFCR Rule 59
motion for reconsideration of the January 11, 2017 order on January 23, 2017.That motion was denied by order entered on March 20, 2017. Kathleen's openingbrief makes no argument that could not have been made in her HFCR Rule 59motion for reconsideration. See Tagupa v. Tagupa, 108 Hawai #i 459, 465, 121
P.3d 924, 930 (App. 2005) (noting that reconsideration is not a device torelitigate old matters or to raise arguments or evidence that could and shouldhave been brought during the earlier proceeding).
