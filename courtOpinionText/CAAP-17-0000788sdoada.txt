SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Chan, JJ.)
 
Defendants-Appellants Mark A. Lee and Cheryl A. Lee
 
(collectively the Lees) appeal from the "Order Granting
 
Plaintiff’s Motion for Confirmation of Sale, Distribution of
 
Proceeds, and for Writ of Ejectment filed March 31, 2017" (Order
 
Confirming Sale), the "Judgment" on the Order Confirming Sale
 
(Judgment Confirming Sale), and the "Writ of Ejectment", all of
 
which were filed on October 2, 2017, in favor of Plaintiff-
Appellee Nationstar Mortgage LLC (Nationstar), in the Circuit
 
Court of the Second Circuit (Circuit Court).1

 The Honorable Joseph E. Cardoza presided.
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On appeal, the Lees contend that the Circuit Court
 
erred in: (1) issuing the Order Confirming Sale, Judgment
 
Confirming Sale, and Writ of Ejectment because Nationstar failed
 to establish standing to invoke the jurisdiction of the Circuit
 Court at the commencement of the foreclosure action; and (2)
 granting Nationstar’s request for attorneys’ fees and costs,
 specifically those incurred in connection with an August 5, 2016
 Judgment on a decree of foreclosure, because the request was
 untimely and thus in violation of Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure
 (HRCP) Rule 54(d)(2)
2. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve the Lees'
 points of error as follows, and affirm.
 
On August 5, 2016, the Circuit Court granted
 
Nationstar’s motion for summary judgment seeking a decree of
 foreclosure and entered the Judgment on the decree of foreclosure
 (Foreclosure Judgment) against all defendants in the foreclosure
 
action, including the Lees. The Lees never appealed from the
 
Foreclosure Judgment.
 
2 HRCP Rule 54(d)(2) provides:
 (2) Attorneys' Fees.
 
(A) Claims for attorneys' fees and related nontaxable
expenses shall be made by motion unless the substantive law
governing the action provides for the recovery of such fees
as an element of damages to be proved at trial.
 
(B) Unless otherwise provided by statute or order of the
court, the motion must be filed and served no later than 14
days after entry of an appealable order or judgment; must
specify the judgment and the statute, rule, or other grounds
entitling the moving party to the award; and must state the
amount or provide a fair estimate of the amount sought. If
directed by the court, the motion shall also disclose the
terms of any agreement with respect to fees to be paid for
the services for which claim is made.
 
(C) The provisions of subparagraphs (A) and (B) do not apply
to claims for fees and expenses as sanctions for violations
of rules.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In the confirmation of sale proceedings, held after the
 
Foreclosure Judgment was issued, the Lees argued the Foreclosure
 
Judgment was void because Nationstar had failed to establish its
 standing to foreclose at the commencement of the action. The
 Lees also argued that Nationstar should be barred from seeking
 attorneys’ fees and costs because it did not file its request
 within fourteen days of the Foreclosure Judgment. 
On October 2, 2017, the Circuit Court entered its Order
 
Confirming Sale and Judgment Confirming Sale in Nationstar’s
 favor. The Circuit Court also awarded Nationstar $10,438.22 in
 attorneys’ fees and $2,115.98 in costs in the Order Confirming
 Sale. 
The primary statute that authorizes a party to appeal
 
in a foreclosure action is Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 667­
51(a) (2016).
3 “Under HRS § 667-51, foreclosure cases are
 
bifurcated into two separately appealable parts: (1) the decree
 
of foreclosure and order of sale appealable pursuant to HRS
 § 667-51(a)(1) and (2) all other orders that ‘fall within the
 second part of the bifurcated proceedings.’” Bank of America,
 
N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai' i 361, 372, 390 P.3d 1248, 1259 
(2017) (quoting Mortg. Elec. Registration Sys., Inc. v. Wise, 130
 
3 HRS § 667-51(a) provides: 
[§667-51] Appeals. (a) Without limiting the class of
orders not specified in section 641-1 from which appeals may also
be taken, the following orders entered in a foreclosure case
shall be final and appealable:
(1) 	A judgment entered on a decree of foreclosure, and if
the judgment incorporates an order of sale or an
adjudication of a movant's right to a deficiency
judgment, or both, then the order of sale or the
adjudication of liability for the deficiency judgment
also shall be deemed final and appealable;
(2) 	A judgment entered on an order confirming the sale of
the foreclosed property, if the circuit court
expressly finds that no just reason for delay exists,
and certifies the judgment as final pursuant to rule
54(b) of the Hawaii rules of civil procedure; and
(3) 	A deficiency judgment; provided that no appeal from a
deficiency judgment shall raise issues relating to
the judgment debtor's liability for the deficiency
judgment (as opposed to the amount of the deficiency
judgment), nor shall the appeal affect the finality
of the transfer of title to the foreclosed property
pursuant to the order confirming sale.

Hawai'i 11, 16, 304 P.3d 1192, 1197 (2013)). A decree of 
foreclosure “finally determines the merits of the controversy,” 
and is immediately appealable upon its entry. Wise, 130 Hawai' i 
at 16, 304 P.3d at 1197 (quoting MDG Supply, Inc. v. Diversified Investments, Inc., 51 Haw. 375, 380, 463 P.2d 525, 528 (1969)). Any subsequent proceedings such as orders confirming sale are thus separately appealable from the decree of foreclosure, and fall within the second part of the bifurcated proceedings. Id. 
Such subsequent proceedings are simply incidents to a decree of foreclosure’s enforcement. Id. 
In Wise, a foreclosure action, the Supreme Court of 
Hawai'i held that mortgagors were precluded from challenging a 
mortgagee’s standing to bring the foreclosure action where the mortgagors had failed to appeal from the foreclosure judgment, but had appealed from the confirmation of sale proceedings. 130 Hawai'i at 17, 304 P.3d at 1198. In short, a challenge to a 
foreclosing plaintiff’s standing to bring a foreclosure action must be asserted in a timely appeal from the judgment of foreclosure, or such challenge is precluded by the doctrine of res judicata. Id. 
Likewise, we have reiterated that "the doctrine of res 
judicata precludes foreclosure defendants from raising defenses at the confirmation of sale of the subject property that could have been raised in the earlier foreclosure proceedings[.]" See 
Bank of America, N.A. v. Panzo, No. CAAP-14-0001356, 2017 WL 1194002, at *1 (Hawai' i App. Mar. 31, 2017), reconsideration 
denied, CAAP-14-0001356, 2017 WL 1753390 (Hawai' i App. May 4, 
2017), cert. denied, SCWC-14-0001356, 2017 WL 4837872, (Haw. Oct. 26, 2017)(holding that having not preserved the standing argument in conjunction with the Foreclosure Judgment, mortgagor was not entitled to relief based on a standing argument in an appeal from the subsequent confirmation of sale proceedings); see also Nationstar Mortgage LLC v. Akepa Properties LLC, No. CAAP-15­0000407, 2017 WL 1401468, at *2 (Hawai' i App. Apr. 19, 2017) 
(holding that, where a foreclosure defendant did not appeal from the foreclosure judgment, it could not raise or resurrect its standing arguments in the subsequent confirmation of sale 
4
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
proceedings or in an HRCP Rule 60(b) motion). Similarly, here,
 
the Lees' failure to appeal from the Foreclosure Judgment
 precludes them from objecting to Nationstar’s standing in this
 appeal from the Order Confirming Sale. 
In this appeal, the Lees fail to assert any error made
 
by the Circuit Court specific to its Order Confirming Sale,
 Judgment Confirming Sale, and Writ of Ejectment. Instead, the
 Lees contend that this Court must set aside the Order Confirming
 Sale because it is void under HRCP Rule 60(b)(4) for lack of
 standing, despite there being no ruling on an HRCP Rule 60(b)
 motion properly before us in this appeal.
4 In any event, we have
 
previously held that lack of standing does not render a court’s
 ruling void under HRCP Rule 60(b)(4). Akepa, 2017 WL 1401468, at
 
*2-3. 
As to the Lees’ second point of error, we conclude that 
the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in awarding Nationstar attorneys’ fees and costs in its entry of the Order Confirming Sale. See Central Pacific Bank v. Metcalfe, No. CAAP­
14-0000851, 2015 WL 3549997, at *1 (Hawai' i App. June 4, 
2015)(affirming trial court’s award of attorneys’ fees and costs to a mortgagee in conjunction with an entry of order confirming sale following a foreclosure decree). 
In the instant appeal, the Lees contend that the
 
Circuit Court abused its discretion in awarding attorneys’ fees
 and costs to Nationstar because: (1) Nationstar failed to file a
 motion for attorneys’ fees and costs within fourteen days after
 entry of the Foreclosure Judgment in violation of HRCP Rule
 54(d)(2); and (2) the Circuit Court lacked jurisdiction to award
 
4 On November 21, 2017, after the Lees filed their notice of appeal in
this appeal, they filed “Defendant Mark A. Lee and Cheryl A. Lees’ HRCP Rule
60(b) Motion for Relief from Foreclosure Judgments” ( HRCP Rule 60(b) Motion ).
In the HRCP Rule 60(b) motion, the Lees asked the Circuit Court to set aside
1) an FOF/COL and order, 2) the Foreclosure Judgment, and 3) the Order
Confirming Sale, because Nationstar failed to establish its standing to
foreclose on the subject property at the commencement of the action. In the
 opening brief, the Lees note that said Motion for Relief was orally denied at
a hearing held on January 24, 2018, and that no order denying said motion had
been filed at the time of the instant appeal.

attorneys’ fees and costs at the confirmation of sale
 
proceedings. 
As a preliminary matter, we have previously held that 
in a foreclosure action, a trial court retains jurisdiction to award attorneys’ fees and costs at the entry of confirmation of sale despite a request being filed outside the time frame set forth in HRCP Rule 54(d)(2) and after the filing of a notice of appeal from a foreclosure judgment. Metcalfe, 2015 WL 3549997, 
at *1. “Generally, the filing of a notice of appeal divests the trial court of jurisdiction over the appealed case.” Metcalfe, 
2015 WL 3549997, at *1 (quoting TSA Int’l, Ltd. v. Shimizu Corp., 92 Hawai' i 243, 265, 990 P.2d 713, 735 (1999)). However, 
“[n]otwithstanding the general effect of the filing of a notice of appeal, the trial court retains jurisdiction to determine matters collateral or incidental to the judgment, and may act in aid of the appeal.” Id. As noted in Metcalfe: 
[t]he decree of foreclosure is deemed final for appeal
purposes notwithstanding the fact that many matters relating
to it remain undetermined. Matters such as the order of sale,
appointment of commissioner, confirmation of sale, award of
costs and fees, and award of deficiency judgment are deemed to
be incidents to the enforcement of the decree of foreclosure.
 . . . and errors unique to them are separately appealable, .
. . when they are fully adjudicated[.]
 
2015 WL 3549997, at *1 (quoting Sturkie v. Han, 2 Haw. App. 140,
 
146-147, 627 P.2d 296, 302 (Haw. App. 1981 (emphasis in
 original). Accordingly, the Circuit Court had jurisdiction to
 award Nationstar attorneys’ fees and costs at the confirmation of
 sale proceedings. 
The Circuit Court’s award of attorneys’ fees and costs
 
to Nationstar is likewise in compliance with the requirements set
 forth in HRCP 54(d)(2). HRCP Rule 54(d)(2)(B) provides, in
 relevant part: 
Unless otherwise provided by statute or order of the court,
the motion [for attorneys’ fees and expenses] must be filed
and served no later than 14 days after entry of an appealable
order or judgment; must specify the judgment and the statute,
rule, or other grounds entitling the moving party to the
award; and must state the amount or provide a fair estimate of
the amount sought. 
(Emphasis added). Here, the Circuit Court explicitly ordered in
 
its “Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment and/or Default Judgment,
 
and For Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure Against All Parties,
 Filed April 4, 2016" (FOF/COL and Order) that “[t]he amount of
 
attorneys’ fees and costs shall be determined by the [Circuit]
 
Court at the hearing confirming the sale of the Property.” 
Accordingly, the Circuit Court, through its entry of its FOF/COL
 and Order, provided an alternate deadline to determine the amount
 of attorneys’ fees and costs, thus dispensing with the general
 fourteen day requirement, as allowed under HRCP Rule 54(d)(2)(B). 
In “Plaintiff’s Motion for Confirmation of Sale, Distribution of
 Proceeds, and For Writ of Ejectment”, Nationstar set forth its
 request and supporting documentation for attorneys’ fees and
 costs, which the Circuit Court subsequently approved. Given the
 record in this case, the Circuit Court did not abuse its
 discretion in its award of attorneys’ fees and costs to
 Nationstar, and its award was compliant with HRCP Rule 54(d)(2). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Circuit Court
 
of the Second Circuit’s "Order Granting Plaintiff’s Motion for
 Confirmation of Sale, Distribution of Proceeds, and for Writ of
 Ejectment filed March 31, 2017", the "Judgment", and the "Writ of
 Ejectment", all filed on October 2, 2017, are affirmed.
