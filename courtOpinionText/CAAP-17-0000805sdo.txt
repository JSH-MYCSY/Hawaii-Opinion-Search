 Denying Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment and Granting 
Defendants' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings ( Order Granting 
Motion), filed September 19, 2017.  
In this case, Appellants challenge the adoption of 
amendments to the Rules Governing the Manufacture and Sale of 
Intoxicating Liquor of the County of Maui ( Commission Rules) in 
2017, by Defendants -Appellees  Liquor Control Commission 
(Commission ), Director of the Department of Liquor Control 
(Director ), and the County of Maui ( County) (collectively, 
Appellees ).  Appellants' Amended Complaint contends that the 
Commission violated the Sunshine Law  notice requirements set 
forth in Hawaii Revised Stat utes (HRS) § 92-7 (2012 and 2015 
Supp.), and the Hawaiʻi Administrative Procedure Act  rule making 
requirements set forth in HRS chapter 91.   
On appeal, Appellants c ontend that  the circuit court 
erred in concluding: (1) the Commission gave sufficient notice 
of a public meeting, pursuant to  HRS § 92 -7, to review proposed 
rule amendments; (2) Appellants claims were  mooted by the 
Commission's repeal of  the challenged  rule amendments; (3) the 
County was not "engaging in rulemaking" by implementing  "full 
criminal background checks before issuing Class Ten special 
licenses" ; and (4) therefore, Appellees were entitled to 
judgment on the pleadings , and Appellants were not entitled to 
summary judgment.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 Upon careful review of the record and relevant legal 
authorities, and having given due consideration to the arguments 
advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve 
Appellants' points of error as follows:  
(1) We first address the issue of mootness.2  In their 
Amended Complaint, Appellants contended that the Commission's 
notice of its February 8, 2017 meeting ( February meeting ) was 
not sufficient to comply with HRS § 92 -7.  The circuit court 
determined that this issue was moot because Appellants were 
challenging three specific rule amendments that were subject to 
controversy and later repealed by the Commission.3    
Appellants contend the circuit court misunderstood 
their complaint as only challenging the three controversial 
rules when they actually sought to invalidate "all the 
improperly adopted rule changes"  on the February meeting agenda.  
We agree.  Because  Appellants ' Amended Complaint  appears to 
challenge  all of the rule changes, including  those rule changes 
that were not repealed, this issue is not moot.  
 
2  We review Appellants' points of error nos. 1 and 2 out of order 
to first address the circuit court's mootness ruling.     
 
3  At the outset, we note that mootness is an issue of 
justiciability.  State v. Hewitt , 153 Haw ai‘i 33, 42, 526 P.3d 558, 567 
(2023), as corrected  (May 18, 2023), recon. denied, No. SCWC-16-0000460, 2023 
WL 2706695 (Haw. Mar. 30, 2023).

 (2) Appellants contend the circuit court erred by 
determining that the Commission's notice of its February meeting 
was sufficient under HRS § 92 -7.  The record reflects that, on 
January 6, 2017, the Commission published a Notice of Public 
Hearing ( January notice ) in The Maui News to "amend[] certain 
sections and subsections of the [Commission Rules]" at the 
February meeting .  On February 1, 2017, the Commission published 
an agenda for the February meeting ( February agenda ). 
A meeting agenda simultaneously satisfies HRS § 92 -7's 
written notice requirement if it describes the proposed rules, 
and states where the proposed rules can be found pursuant to 
HRS § 91-2.6 (2012).  HRS § 92 -7.4  When interpreting a statute, 
 
4   HRS § 92 -7 states, in pertinent part,  
 
(a) The board shall give written public notice of any  
regular, special, or rescheduled meeting, or any executive 
meeting when anticipated in advance.   The notice shall 
include an agenda which lists all of the items to be 
considered at the forthcoming meeting, the date, time, and 
place of the meeting [.] . . . If an item to be considered 
is the proposed adoption, amendment, or repeal of 
administrative rules, an agenda meets the requirements  for 
public notice pursuant to this section if it contains a 
statement on the topic of the proposed rules or a general 
description of the subjects involved, as described in 
section 91 -3(a)(1)(A), and a statement of when and where 
the proposed rules may be v iewed in  person and on the 
Internet as provided in section 91 -2.6.  The means 
specified by this section shall be the only means required 
for giving notice under this part notwithstanding any law 
to the contrary.  
 
(b) The board shall file the notice in  the office of the 
lieutenant governor or the appropriate county clerk's 
office, and in the board's office for public inspection, at 
least six calendar days before the meeting.    
 
(Emphasis added).

 "[o]ur foremost obligation is to ascertain and give effect to 
the intention of the legislature, which is to be obtained 
primarily from the language contained in the statute itself."  
Castro v. Melchor , 142 Hawai ʻi 1, 11, 414 P.3d 53, 63 (2018) 
(citation s omitted).   
On this record, we conclude that the February agenda 
failed to provide a "statement of when and where the proposed 
rules may be viewed in person and on the Internet as provided in 
section 91 -2.6."  Thus, the February agenda did not satisfy 
HRS § 92-7's notice requirement .  Further, the January notice 
did not provide  sufficient notice because it neither included an 
agenda nor was it filed with the county clerk.  Therefore, the 
circuit court erred in concluding that notice for the February 
meeting complied with HRS § 92 -7. 
In light of our conclusion  that Appellants ' Amended 
Complaint  challenged all the rule amendments  adopted at the 
Commission's February 8, 2017 meeting , including those that were 
not repealed , and our determination that the Commission did not 
satisfy notice requirements pursuant to HRS § 92 -7, we remand 
the case for the circuit court to address the validity of these 
rule amendments . 
(3) Appellants contend that the circuit court erred in 
concluding that "the County's implementation of full criminal 
background checks before issuing Class Ten special licenses is NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 within its authority under HRS §281 -53.5(a); and the County was 
not engaging in rulemaking governed under HRS § 91 -3 and subject 
to Sunshine Law notice requirements, 'but rather determining 
methods of enforcing a preexisting agency rule.'"5  Appellants 
further contend that "[t]he circuit court clearly erred because 
it is precisely because the County has the discretion  to require 
criminal background checks for Class 10 Special License that its 
new policy was [a rule .]"  (Emphasis in original).  Appellants 
request that this court "invalidate the new [2017] practices and 
policies that interpret and implement the application process 
and licensing process for Class 10 Special Licenses[.]"  
In July 2018, after the opening and answering briefs 
were filed, two statutory amendments, to HRS §§ 281 -31(j)6 and 
 
5  Appellants assert that, prior to 2017, the Commission did not 
require applicants of Class 10 special licenses  "for the sale of liquor for a 
period not to exceed three days[,]" and "for the purpose of fundraising 
events by nonprofit organizations[,]"  to comply with criminal background 
checks pursuant to HRS § 281 -53.5(a) (2007).   HRS § 281 -31 (2017 Supp.).  
Thus, Appellants allege that the Commission's implementation , in 2017, of 
criminal background checks with regard to Class 10 license applicants 
constitute s an invalid rule amendment under HRS chapter 91.   
 
6  HRS § 281-31(j) was renumbered and amended to add subsection (2) 
as follows , 
 
(j) Class 10. Special license.  
 
. . . .  
 
(2)  Notwithstanding any other section of this chapter to 
the contrary, the commission shall waive any 
hearings, fees, notarization of documents, submission 
of floor plans and other governmental clearances, and 
other requirements for the issuance of a clas s 10 
license.  The class 10 license granted under this 
subsection for a fundraising event shall include the

 281-327 respectively, were signed into law.  These statutory 
amendments provide, in relevant part and by their plain 
language, that "[n]o criminal history record check under section 
281-53.5 or 846 -2.7 or any other section of this chapter shall 
be required."

ability to auction off, at a live or silent auction, 
liquor in sealed or covered glass, ceramic, or metal 
containers or services that provide liquor.  No 
criminal history record check under section 281 -53.5 
or 846-2.7 or any other section of this chapter shall 
be required.   The commission may require proof of 
liquor liability insurance for the fundraising event 
and a current list of officers and directors if the 
applicant is a nonprofit organization.

31(j) (2020))  (emphasis added) .   
 
7  HRS § 281 -32 was amended, in pertinent part, to provide:  
 
  . . . .  
 
 (b) Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, 
the commission shall reduce submission requirements, 
including the waiving of hearings, fees, notarization of 
documents, submission of floor plans, and other 
requirements, to provide for the issuance of temporary 
licenses for the sale of liquor for a period not to exceed 
one day for fundraising events by nonprofit 
organizations.  . . . No criminal history record checks 
under section 281 -53.5 shall be required; provided that the 
commission may require a background check on the executive 
director of the nonprofit organization.   
  
 For purposes of this subsection, "nonprofit 
organization" means those charitable organizations 
recognized under state or federal law and exempt from 
federal taxes under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal 
Revenue Code.  
 
 (c) The commission may adopt rules to implement this 
section.

 Moreover, Commission Rule § 08 -101-22(j) (2019) was 
amended in 2019 to provide, consistent with the above statutory 
amendments, that with respect to Class 10 special licenses,  
Notwithstanding any other section of chapter 281, HRS, to 
the contrary, the commission shall waive any hearings, 
fees, notarization of documents, submission of floor plans 
and other requirements for the issuance of a class 10 
license.   
 
. . . .  
 
No background check under section 846 -2.7, section 281 -
53.5, HRS, or any other section of chapter 281, HRS shall 
be required.  The applicant shall provide a current list of 
officers and directors, if the applicant is a nonprofit 
organization.  Unless waived by the commission, proof of 
liquor liability insurance shall be required.  
 
Commission Rule § 08 -101-22(j)(5) (emphasis added).   
Given the statutory and rule amendments set forth 
above, this court is not able to provide the effective relief 
that Appellants request in their opening brief.8  We dismiss 
Appellant's point of error no. 3 as moot.  Hamilton ex rel. 
Lethem v. Lethem , 119 Hawai ʻi 1, 5, 193 P.3d 839, 843 (2008) 
("The [mootness] doctrine seems appropriate where events 
subsequent to the judgment of the trial court have so affected 
the relations between the parties that the two conditions for 
justiciability relevant on appeal ——adverse interest and 
effective remedy ——have been compromised.") (cleaned up).   
 
8  This Court ordered supplemental briefing as to whether, given the 
statutory and rule amendments, which the parties had not previously 
addressed, this Court could effectively grant the relief that Appellants seek 
with regard to point of error no. 3.  Appell ees contend that point of error 
no. 3 is moot.  Appellants disagree.  We conclude that point of error no. 3 
is moot for the reasons discussed herein.     NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 For the foregoing reasons, we dismiss Appellant's 
point of error no. 3 as moot, and vacate in part the circuit 
court's Order Granting Motion, filed September 19, 2017, and  
Final Judgment, entered October 17, 2017.  We remand for further 
proceedings consistent with this summary disposition order.
