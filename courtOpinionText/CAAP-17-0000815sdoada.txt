and COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY, Garnishee-Appellee. 
 
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
PUNA DIVISION 
(CIVIL NO. 3RC16-1-0329) 
  
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Big Island Federal Credit Union 
(Big Island FCU), appeals from the District Court of the Third 
Circuit's (1) August 7, 2017 "Order Denying Garnishee Order" 
(Order Denying Garnishment
)1 and (2) October 31, 2017 order 
denying Big Island FCU's motion for "reconsideration" of the Order Denying Garnishment.
2  On appeal, Big Island FCU raises 
three points of error.

  Upon careful review of the record and the brief 
submitted3 and having given due consideration to the issues 
raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve Big Island FCU's 
points of error as discussed below. 
 (1) Big Island FCU's first point of error alleges that 
the district court reversibly erred in not issuing a garnishee order on Colorado State University, a nonresident garnishee and 
the employer of Aguiar. 
 However, this point of error challenges the post-
judgment Order Denying Garnishment, and we lack jurisdiction 
over an appeal from this order because Big Island FCU failed to 
file a notice of appeal within thirty days of this order.  See 
Hawaiʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 4(a)(1) (providing that 
"the notice of appeal shall be filed within 30 days after entry 
of the judgment or appealable order"); Chun v. Bd. of Trs. of 
Employees' Ret. Sys. of State of Hawai‘ i, 106 Hawai‘ i 416, 428 
n.12, 106 P.3d 339, 351 n.12 (2005) (explaining that "[a] postjudgment order is an appealable final order under [Hawaii Revised Statutes] § 641-1(a) (1993) if the order finally 
determines the postjudgment proceeding"). 
 Because Big Island FCU filed its August 31, 2017 
motion for "reconsideration" based on District Court Rules of 
                                                           
 
3  Defendant- Appellee Wilfred E. Aguiar, Jr. (Aguiar) did not file an 
answering brief.  The appellate clerk entered a notice of default of the 
answering brief on October 26, 2018. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 Civil Procedure (DCRCP) Rule 60 (Rule 60 Motion) over three 
weeks after the Order Denying Garnishment, Big Island FCU's 
Rule 60 Motion did not toll the thirty-day deadline to appeal.  
DCRCP Rule 60(b); see Lambert v. Lua, 92 Hawaiʻ i 228, 234, 990 
P.2d 126, 132 (App. 1999) (noting that a Hawai
‘i Rules of Civil 
Procedure Rule 60(b) motion can only toll "the period for 
appealing a judgment or order" if filed within ten days of the 
judgment).  Thus, Big Island FCU's appeal from the post-judgment
Order Denying Garnishment was untimely, and this court lacks 
jurisdiction over an appeal from that order.  
 (2) In its second point of error, Big Island FCU 
contends that the district court abused its discretion in denying Big Island FCU's Rule 60 Motion.  Big Island FCU argues 
that the Garnishee Disclosure was filed after the Order Denying 
Garnishment was issued, and "could not have been presented 
during the hearing" on August 7, 2017.  To that point, Big 
Island FCU argues that the Garnishee Disclosure was relevant as 
it constituted a general appearance by Colorado State University in the district court proceedings, citing Ferreira v. Kamo, 18 
Haw. 593, 594 (Haw. Terr. 1908). 
 Ferreira, however, can be distinguished from the 
instant case because Colorado State University was not represented by counsel at any proceeding.  See id., 18 Haw. at 
594 (noting garnishee's general appearance through an attorney).

 unincorporated associations, and other entities generally must 
appear in court through an attorney, except in limited 
circumstances.  See Alexander & Baldwin, LLC v. Armitage, 151 
Hawaiʻi 37, 48-49, 508 P.3d 832, 843-44 (2022); see also Church
of the New Testament v. U.S., 783 F.2d 771, 773-74 (9th Cir. 
1986) (stating unincorporated entity must be represented by an 
attorney) (citation omitted).  Based on the record, the 
Garnishee Disclosure was signed by a human resources representative at Colorado State University, not an attorney.  
Thus, the Garnishee Disclosure was not new evidence showing 
Colorado State University made an appearance in this case to 
warrant relief pursuant to DCRCP Rule 60.  
 (3) In its third point of error, Big Island FCU 
contends that the district court erred in denying its request at 
the end of the October 4, 2017 hearing for service on Colorado State University "by and through" Aguiar, its employee. 
Big Island FCU, however, fails to demonstrate how its 
argument that it could serve Colorado State University through 
Aguiar meets any of the criteria for granting relief pursuant to 
DCRCP Rule 60.  See DCRCP Rule 60.  Rather, this argument 
challenges the post-judgment Order Denying Garnishment, and we lack jurisdiction over an appeal from that order as discussed 
above.  
 Based on the foregoing, we dismiss Big Island FCU's 
appeal of the August 7, 2017 "Order Denying Garnishee Order" for NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
