 of the Estate of Pauline Isaacs-Lean (Estate)1 and 
Defendant/Cross-Claim Plaintiff/Cross-Claim Defendant-
Appellee/Cross-Appellant Mililani Town Association (Association) 
appeal from the Circuit Court of the First Circuit's October 20, 
2017 Final Judgment granting Defendant/Cross-Claim 
Defendant/Cross-Claim Plaintiff-Appellee/Cross-Appellee SVMM 
Investments LLC's (SVMM) Motion for Summary Judgment and Order 
to Disburse Interpleaded Funds.2 
I. Background 
  Briefly, Pauline Isaacs-Lean (Isaacs-Lean), according 
to Estate, was 81 years old and suffering from dementia.  Based 
on her failure to pay $418 in maintenance fees, Association 
foreclosed on Isaacs-Lean's home (Property), which was secured 
by a mortgage with First Hawaiian Bank. 
Association's Public Notice of Public Sale stated the 
sale was "subject to" any prior liens.  In March 2015, SVMM 
purchased the Property for $240,100.00 during the non-judicial foreclosure sale, where Association and non-party Chun Mei Tong 
 
1  On April 2 , 2018, Alvin K. Isaacs was substituted as Successor 
Personal Representative of the Estate of Pauline Isaacs- Lean in place of 
Hilton Lui, Personal Representative. 
 
2  The Honorable Keith K. Hiraoka presided.   The Honorable Karen T. 
Nakasone presided over the original interpleader action until the case was 
transferred and reassigned to Judge Hiraoka on April 10, 2017. 
 
The Honorable Edwin C. Nacino presided over Association's petition to 
serve Isaacs
-Lean notice of foreclosure by publication, see infra Footnote 6.

aside title, see infra Footnote 5.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 (Tong) also bid on the Property.  The 2015 tax assessed value 
for the property was $675,200.00. 
On April 27, 2015, Association recorded its quitclaim 
deed to SVMM in the land court.  That same day, the land court 
issued a "State of Hawaii Certificate of Title Certificate 
No. 1096435" (Certificate). 
Title Guaranty Escrow Services (Title Guaranty) 
disbursed a portion of the sale proceeds to pay Association and the costs of the foreclosure.  However, a conflict arose as to 
the disbursement of the remaining proceeds, with SVMM 
instructing Title Guaranty to pay First Hawaiian Bank and 
Association instructing Title Guaranty to pay Isaacs-Lean. 
In September 2015, Title Guaranty filed the complaint 
at issue here to determine the distribution of the surplus sale 
proceeds.  Title Guaranty deposited the contested funds with the 
circuit court, and was dismissed from the case. 
Isaacs-Lean passed away in July 2016. 
In March 2017, SVMM moved for summary judgment, 
positing that there was "no material question of fact that:  (a) [Association] conducted a lawful and valid non-judicial 
foreclosure of the Property; and (b) under [Hawaiʻ i Revised 
Statutes (HRS)] § 667-100(b) [(2016)], the Surplus Funds must 
first be allocated to satisfy and discharge the [First Hawaiian 
Bank] mortgage, a valid senior lien." NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 The circuit court granted summary judgment.  The 
circuit court ordered First Hawaiian Bank be paid from the 
surplus funds to satisfy Isaacs-Lean's debt, and Estate be paid 
the balance.3 
II. Discussion 
On appeal, Estate and Association raise numerous 
points of error challenging the circuit court's granting of SVMM's motion for summary judgment and the distribution of the sale proceeds.
4  In its answering briefs, SVMM, among other 
 
3  First Hawaiian Bank released any claims on the Property after the 
circuit court ordered the funds distributed, and filed no briefs in this 
appeal. 
 
4  Estate contends the c ircuit court erred in granting SVMM's motion for 
summary judgment where: 
 (1) Association did not personally serve Isaacs- Lean with notice of 
default and intention to foreclose; 
  (2) notice was served by publication; 
  (3) the non- judicial foreclosure sale price was inadequate because the 
sale price was below the tax assessed value of the home;  
 (4) the circuit court should have continued the hearing on SVMM's 
motion for s ummary judgment until after the l and court ruled on a 
request to set aside the Certificate in favor of SVMM and to 
restore title to Isaacs- Lean's Estate;  
 (5) Isaacs- Lean's Estate should have been permitted to challenge the 
non-judicial foreclosure despite the Certificate because she was 
not given notice of the Certificate; and  
 (6) First Hawaiian Bank as the senior mortgagee should not have been 
paid from the sale proceeds where the Public Notice of Public Sale 
provided that the sale was "subject to" all prior liens and 
encumbrances. 
 
(continued . . .)

 things, challenges this court's jurisdiction, asserting 
Association lacks standing and the statutory construction 
question raised is moot.  SVMM also raises preclusion and the 
issuance of the Certificate as defenses. 
We have jurisdiction over this case, and hold that the 
circuit court erred in granting SVMM's motion for summary 
judgment. 
A. Subject Matter Jurisdiction 
We first address SVMM's challenge to this court's 
jurisdiction based on standing and mootness.  In its answer to Association's opening brief, SVMM argues Association is not an 
aggrieved party and, thus, lacks standing to appeal. 
Generally, the requirements of standing to appeal are:   
(1) the person must first have been a party to the action; 
(2) the person seeking modification of the order or 
judgment must have had standing to oppose it in the trial court; and (3) such person must be aggrieved by the ruling, 
i.e., the person must be one who is affected or prejudiced 
by the appealable order.  
 
(. . . continued) 
 
Association raises five points of error, all concerning the 
distribution of the sale proceeds, which it argues should not have been used to pay First Hawaiian Bank's lien against the Property.  Association contends 
the circuit court erred in: 
 (1) disregarding the "subject to" language; 
 
(2) discounting the distribution of sale proceeds; 
 
(3) interpreting HRS § 667- 100; 
 
(4) disparate treatment of the distribution of sale proceeds, citing to 
HRS §§ 667-100, -3, and - 31; and 
 
(5) failing to treat the distribution of funds equitably. 
 
Association's points of error are addressed collectively below at section 
II(C). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 Kahala Royal Corp. v. Goodsill Anderson Quinn & Stifel, 113 
Hawaiʻi 251, 275-76, 151 P.3d 732, 756-57 (2007) (emphasis 
omitted and added) (quoting Kepoʻ o v. Watson, 87 Hawaiʻ i 91, 95, 
952 P.2d 379, 383 (1998)). 
SVMM is correct that Association recovered its 
delinquent assessments, fees, and costs in full by the proceeds 
of the sale.  But, Association would be affected by the construction of HRS § 667-100, which governs its duties after a 
non-judicial sale.  In any event, standing "is not an issue of 
subject matter jurisdiction[.]"  Tax Found. of Hawai
ʻi v. State, 
144 Hawaiʻ i 175, 188, 439 P.3d 127, 140 (2019). 
SVMM also contends the "question of statutory 
construction raised in the Cross-Appeal is moot."  SVMM argues 
the warranty deed, which transferred the Property from SVMM to 
non-party Henry Hoang, renders Association's appeal moot.  
However, like standing, "mootness is a prudential consideration 
and not an issue of subject matter jurisdiction[.]"  State v. 
Hewitt, 153 Hawai‘ i 33, 41, 526 P.3d 558, 566 (2023). 
Although the return of title and possession would not 
be possible if the property at issue was resold to an innocent 
third party purchaser for value, this court is not excused from 
addressing the merits of the case in light of the circuit 
court's equitable powers to fashion other appropriate remedies.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 See Santiago v. Tanaka, 137 Hawaiʻ i 137, 154 n.33, 366 P.3d 612, 
629 n.33 (2016) (explaining "money damages . . . may be 
substituted for title and possession in certain instances pursuant to the equitable powers of a court in adjudicating a 
case arising from a mortgage foreclosure[.]").  
Thus, contrary to SVMM's arguments, this court has 
jurisdiction over Association's appeal. 
 
B. Summary Judgment  
Next, Estate challenges the circuit court's granting 
of SVMM's motion for summary judgment based on improper notice (first, second, and fifth points of error), inadequate price 
(third point of error), and failure to grant a continuance (fourth point of error). 
As the movant for summary judgment, SVMM bore the 
burden of demonstrating there was no genuine issue of material 
fact.  See generally, French v. Hawaii Pizza Hut, Inc., 105 
Hawaiʻi 462, 470, 99 P.3d 1046, 1054 (2004).  SVMM relied on the 
Certificate being conclusive, the judgment for possession being 
preclusive, and Association's Affidavit of Foreclosure Under 
Power of Sale (Foreclosure Affidavit) being prima facie evidence 
that the non-judicial foreclosure was lawfully conducted.

 "We review a circuit court's grant or denial of 
summary judgment de novo under the same standard applied by the 
circuit court."  Hawaii Cmty. Fed. Credit Union v. Keka, 94 
Hawaiʻi 213, 221, 11 P.3d 1, 9 (2000) (cleaned up).  
1. Certificate 
 
 In its fifth point of error, Estate disputes the 
circuit court's determination that the Certificate was conclusive and unimpeachable evidence as to the validity of the 
foreclosure sale because Isaacs-Lean was not notified of the 
Certificate.  In its answering brief, SVMM counters, "On 
April 27, 2015, the [Assistant Registrar of the] Land Court [of 
the State of Hawaiʻ i] . . . issued Transfer Certificate of Title 
('TCT') No. 1,096,435 to SVMM as the Property's new registered 
owner," and cites "Dkt. #23 at 323-324."  (Emphasis omitted.) 
A land court certificate of title is "conclusive and 
unimpeachable" evidence of title upon 
entry of the certificate 
of title.  See HRS §§ 501-88, -118 (2006) ("After a new 
certificate of title has been entered, no judgment recovered on the mortgage note for any balance due thereon shall operate to 
open the foreclosure or affect the title to registered land."); 
Aames Funding Corp. v. Mores, 107 Hawaiʻ i 95, 102-03 , 110 P.3d 
1042, 1049-50 (2005) (holding that a mortgagor's right to affect 
the title on registered land "must be raised 'prior to the entry 
of a new certificate of title.'") (quoting HRS § 501-118).  "HRS NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 § 501-118 specifies 'entry of a new certificate of title' as the 
determinative point when foreclosure proceedings may no longer 
be impeached," not filing of a quitclaim deed or issuance of a 
certificate number.  Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Omiya, 142 Hawaiʻ i 
439, 449, 420 P.3d 370, 380 (2018). 
  The document to which SVMM refers does not expressly 
indicate "entry" into the land court registry and, thus, is not 
unimpeachable evidence of title.  See Omiya, 142 Hawai
ʻi at 455, 
420 P.3d at 386 ("[A]ssignment of a new TCT number does not 
demonstrate that a new certificate of title has been duly 
prepared and entered.").  To the extent it relied on the 
April 27, 2015 Certificate, the circuit court erred because SVMM 
failed to show there was no genuine issue as to whether a new 
certificate was "entered."5 
 2. Judgment for Summary Possession 
On May 27, 2015, SVMM filed a complaint for summary 
possession in the District Court of the First Circuit, attaching 
the April 27, 2015 Quitclaim Deed.  On June 24, 2015, the 
 
5  We take judicial notice of the document list and minutes in Hilton 
Lui, PR v. SVMM Invs. LLC, et als., Case No. 1LD171002274, where Estate 
petitioned to set aside Certificate No. 1096435, and the land court denied 
SVMM's motion to dismiss "based upon genuine issues of material fact 
regarding the issuance of the TCT."  (Formatting altered.)  See Hawaiʻi Rules 
of Evidence (HRE) Rule 201; State v. Akana, 68 Haw. 164, 165- 66, 706 P.2d 
1300, 1302 (1985) (discussing judicial notice of court's own records in 
related proceedings). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
10 
 district court entered default against Isaacs-Lean, entered a 
judgment for possession, and issued a writ of possession.6 
The circuit court concluded "Isaacs-Lean's failure to 
challenge SVMM's district court summary possession complaint or 
to appeal SVMM's judgment for possession precludes [Estate] from 
challenging title to the foreclosed property."  (Emphasis 
added.) 
In its answering brief, SVMM argues Estate failed to 
challenge in its opening brief the circuit court's conclusion that SVMM's judgment for possession precluded Estate from 
challenging its title and, thus, Estate waived any such 
challenge. 
But, we construe the Estate's challenge to the 
validity of the foreclosure sale as a challenge to more than 
SVMM's title.  In view of the applicable case law, Estate 
appears to seek relief from a wrongful foreclosure and the 
related distribution of sale proceeds, based in part on the contention that the sale price was inadequate.  See, e.g., In re 
Manuel, 152 Hawai‘ i 290, 302, 526 P.3d 267, 279 (2023) ("A 
complaint, filed after the entry of a new TCT and seeking the 
second remedy (money damages against a wrongfully foreclosing 
 
6  We also take judicial notice of the court minutes in SVMM Invs. LLC 
v. Wallace K. Lean et al., Case No. 1RC151004411. See H RE Rule 201; Akana, 68 
Haw. at 165-66, 706 P.2d at 1302. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
11 
 mortgagee), does not 'directly impeach' foreclosure proceedings 
because it does not challenge the matters contained within the 
new TCT (i.e., the identification of the owner of the 
property.)"). 
A challenge to the validity of a foreclosure sale is 
not limited to affecting title to the property, as the Hawai
‘i 
Supreme Court has made clear.  See Santiago, 137 Hawai‘ i at 158, 
366 P.3d at 633 (fashioning equitable relief where resale to a third party rendered voiding the foreclosure sale 
impracticable).  Where title cannot be restored, the circuit 
court may provide other appropriate equitable relief.  See 
generally, id. 
Moreover, in light of the particular circumstances of 
this case, we do not view Estate's challenge to the validity of Association's non-judicial foreclosure sale as a claim that had to be raised in the summary possession action, particularly 
where the foreclosing party (i.e., Association) was not a party 
to that action. 
Thus, contrary to SVMM's argument, Estate did not 
waive its challenge to the validity of the foreclosure sale and 
the related distribution of sale proceeds. 
 3. Association's Non-judicial Foreclosure Sale 
In its third point of error, Estate contends "the 
Circuit Court erred in granting . . . SVMM's motion for summary NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
12 
 judgment, because the price obtained at the non-judicial 
foreclosure sale . . . was inadequate."  Estate also argues the 
circuit court "did not make the sale 'subject to' the prior 
lien" as stated in the terms and conditions of the sale.  Estate 
concludes "[t]hese facts alone create genuine issues of material 
fact[.]" 
In Kondaur, the Hawaiʻ i Supreme Co urt reemphasized the 
protections outlined in Ulrich that safeguard fairness in non-
judicial foreclosure sales.  Kondaur Cap. Corp. v. Matsuyoshi, 
136 Hawaiʻ i 227, 240, 361 P.3d 454, 467 (2015); Ulrich v. Sec. 
Inv. Co., 35 Haw. 158, 168 (Haw. Terr. 1939).  Non-judicial 
foreclosure sales in Hawaiʻ i must be conducted "in a manner that 
is fair, reasonably diligent, and in good faith, and . . . demonstrate that an adequate price was procured for the 
property."  Kondaur, 136 Hawaiʻ i at 240, 361 P.3d at 467. 
Even if we assume arguendo that SVMM met its initial 
burden for summary judgment, the burden would shift to Estate to 
show there was a genuine issue of material fact.7  See French, 
 
7  We note that a bona fide purchaser for value would not "bear the 
burden of demonstrating that the nonjudicial foreclosure sale was conducted 
in a manner that was 'fair, reasonably diligent, and in good faith and that 
an adequate price was procured for the property.'"  See Blue Mountain Homes, 
LLC v. Page, 153 Hawaiʻ i 123, 526 P.3d 648, No. CAAP- 18-0000927, 2023 WL 
2607544 at *5 n.7 (App. Mar. 23, 2023) (SDO) (citation omitted). 
 
But, for summary judgment, the movant bears the initial burden of 
demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue
 of material fact.  See Kondaur, 
136 Hawaiʻ i at 240, 361 P.3d at 467 ("This burden may be discharged by 
demonstrating that if the case went to trial, there would be no competent 
evidence to support a judgment for his or her opponent") (cleaned up). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
13 
 105 Hawaiʻ i at 470, 99 P.3d at 1054 ("Only when the moving party 
satisfies its initial burden of production does the burden shift 
to the non-moving party to respond to the motion for summary 
judgment") (quoting GECC Fin. Corp. v. Jaffarian, 79 Hawaiʻ i 516, 
521, 904 P.2d 530, 535 (App. 1995)) (emphasis omitted). 
Estate argues that there was a genuine issue as to 
whether the foreclosure sale was conducted in a manner to 
procure an adequate price, relying on Kondaur's fairness 
obligations.  136 Hawaiʻ i at 240, 361 P.3d at 467.  Estate 
explained there was a loss in equity when considering the 
difference between the Property's 2015 tax assessed value of 
$675,200.00 and the non-judicial foreclosure sale price of 
$240,100.00.  Estate points to the Public Notice of Public Sale, 
which stated that the sale was "subject to" any prior liens.   
Finally, Association provided Tong's affidavit, which stated 
Tong stopped bidding at $240,000.00 "because, based on the terms 
of sale and my understanding of foreclosure process, . . . I 
would have to pay the remaining balance on the mortgage." 
When this evidence is taken together, Estate met its 
burden of showing a genuine issue existed as to whether Association's non-judicial foreclosure sale was conducted fairly 
in a manner procuring an adequate price.  See generally, French, 
105 Hawaiʻ i at 470, 99 P.3d at 1054.  Although HRS § 667-100 
requires Association to distribute proceeds to "[a]ll other NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
14 
 liens and encumbrances in the order of priority as a matter of 
law," its Public Notice of Public Sale stated that the sale was 
"subject to" any prior liens.  See Hungate v. Law Off. of 
David B. Rosen, 139 Hawaiʻ i 394, 409, 391 P.3d 1, 16 (2017) 
("While final bids on foreclosed property need not equate to 
fair market values, the mortgagee nonetheless has a duty to use 
fair and reasonable means to conduct the foreclosure sale in a 
manner that is conducive to obtaining the best price under the 
circumstances."), abrogated on other grounds by State ex rel. 
Shikada v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., 152 Hawaiʻ i 418, 526 P.3d 
395 (2023). 
Based on that notice, Tong stopped bidding at 
$240,000.00 as Tong understood the First Hawaiian Bank debt 
would be owed in addition to the final bid.  The final bid was $240,100.00, far below the tax assessed value of $675,200.00.  
See Omiya, 142 Hawai
ʻi at 457, 420 P.3d at 388 (holding the 
difference between a tax assessed value of $281,100.00 and 
foreclosure sales price of $15,000.00 created a "genuine issue of material fact as to whether the [foreclosing entity] used 
reasonable means to obtain the best price for the Property.").  
And Association's Foreclosure Affidavit makes no averments 
discussing the adequacy of this sale price.   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
15 
 SVMM counters fairness was demonstrated through 
satisfaction of the statute and an auction price of $240,100.00, 
more than enough to cover Association's lien and the debt owed 
to First Hawaiian Bank.  This, however, does not establish that 
there was no genuine issue as to whether the foreclosure sale 
was conducted in a manner "conducive to obtaining the best price 
under the circumstances," entitling SVMM to judgment as a matter 
of law.  See Hungate, 139 Hawaiʻ i at 409, 391 P.3d at 15. 
Based on the evidence presented, the circuit court 
erred in granting SVMM's motion for summary judgment because the 
evidence showed there were genuine issues as to whether the 
foreclosure sale was conducted in a manner that was fair and whether the sale was conducted in a manner conducive to 
obtaining the best price. 
4. Notice and Continuance  
In Estate's first, second, and fourth points of error, 
it challenges the service of the default notice and the circuit court's decision to not continue the hearing on SVMM's motion 
for summary judgment.  Based on our review of the record, there was no error as to service of the default notice, and the 
circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying the 
request to continue the hearing. 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
16 
 C. Construction of HRS § 667-100 
Finally, all of Association's points of error, and 
Estate's sixth point of error, challenge the circuit court's 
construction of HRS § 667-100 and the distribution of the 
foreclosure sale proceeds. 
HRS § 667-100 provides as follows:  
(a) After the purchaser completes the purchase by paying 
the full purchase price and the costs for the purchase, 
the unit shall be conveyed to the purchaser by a 
conveyance document.  The conveyance document shall be 
in a recordable form and shall be signed by the 
association in the association's name.  The unit owner 
shall not be required to sign the conveyance document. 
 
(b) From the sale proceeds, after paying in the following 
order: 
 
(1) The association's attorney's fees and costs; (2) The fees and costs of the power of sale foreclosure; 
(3) The moneys owed to the association; and 
(4) All other liens and encumbrances in the order of 
priority as a matter of law, 
 
the balance of the sale proceeds shall be distributed by 
the association to junior creditors having valid liens 
on the unit in the order of their priority and not pro rata.
  Any remaining surplus after payment in full of 
all valid lien creditors shall be distributed to the 
unit owner. 
 
(c) Lien creditors prior to the association shall not be 
forced to their right of recovery.  However, the 
association and any prior lien creditor may agree in 
writing that the proceeds from the sale will be 
distributed by the association to the prior lien 
creditor towards the payment of moneys owed to the prior lien creditor before any moneys are paid to the 
association.  
 
(Emphases added and formatting altered.)  We review the circuit 
court's construction of a statute de novo under the right/wrong 
standard.  Castro v. Melchor, 142 Hawaiʻ i 1, 11, 414 P.3d 53, 63 
(2018). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
17 
 Simply put, subsection (b) of HRS § 667-100 
unambiguously provides that the sale proceeds must be 
distributed in the following order: 
(1) association's attorney's fees and costs; (2) fees and costs of the power of sale foreclosure; 
(3) money owed to the association; 
(4) all other liens and encumbrances in order of priority; 
(5) junior creditors having valid liens in order of 
priority; and 
(6) unit owner. 
If the non-judicial foreclosure of the Property is 
determined to be valid on remand (see 
infra), then based on the 
record in this case, First Hawaiian Bank fell under subsection 
(b)(4), "all other liens and encumbrances in order of priority."  
(Emphasis added.)  As First Hawaiian Bank was not a junior 
creditor in this case, it did not fall under "junior creditors 
having valid liens," and it did not fall under any of the other categories because it was not the association or unit owner. 
Moreover, nothing in subsection (c) permits 
Association, on its own accord, to deviate from distributing 
sale proceeds in the order set forth in subsection (b).  And 
Association does not provide this court with a statute or rule 
that expressly exempts the sale proceeds from being distributed 
as set forth in HRS § 667-100. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
18 
 Thus, the circuit court did not err in construing HRS 
§ 667-100 as requiring distribution of the sale proceeds to 
First Hawaiian Bank before Estate, if the non-judicial 
foreclosure was valid. 
A mortgage foreclosure is an equitable proceeding 
governed by the rules of equity.  Santiago, 137 Hawai
‘i at 157, 
366 P.3d at 632.  And a valid non-judicial foreclosure is a necessary precondition to the disbursement of sale proceeds 
under HRS § 667-100.  Where a non-judicial foreclosure has been 
conducted unlawfully, it would be inequitable to distribute 
improperly obtained sale proceeds under HRS § 667-100. 
III. Conclusion 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the circuit 
court's October 20, 2017 Final Judgment granting SVMM's Motion 
for Summary Judgment and Order to Disburse Interpleaded Funds, 
and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with 
this memorandum opinion.
