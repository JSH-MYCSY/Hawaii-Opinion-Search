OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v. 
JAMES MONTGOMERY, Defendant-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CR. NO. 16-1-1076 (1PC161001076)) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Chan, JJ.) 
Plaintiff-Appellant State of Hawai# i (State) appeals 
from the Order Denying Hawaiian Humane Society's Requested 
Restitution (Order Denying Restitution), filed on October 16, 2017, in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit court).
1 
On July 5, 2016, Defendant-Appellee James Montgomery 
(Montgomery) was charged by indictment with: Count 1, Cruelty to Animals in the First Degree, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 711-1108.5(1)(a) (2014); and Count 2, Cruelty to Animals in the Second Degree, in violation of HRS § 711-1109(1)(b) (2014). 
On appeal, the State contends that the circuit court 
erred in failing to order Montgomery to make restitution to HHS. The State challenges the following conclusions of law in the circuit court's Order Denying Restitution: 
1. The Hawaiian Humane Society ("HHS") does not fall
under the definition of "victim" pursuant to H.R.S. § 706-
1 The Honorable Shirley M. Kawamura presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
646(d) regarding the facts of this case.
2. HHS did not impound, hold, or receive custody of
the animals pursuant to H.R.S. §§ 711-1109.1, 711-1109.2 or
711-1110.5. Instead HHS received all the animals in this case pursuant to animal surrender agreements.
3. The plain language of 706-646, obligates HHS to
satisfy the requisites outlined in H.R.S §§ 711-1109.1, 711-1109.2 or 711-1110.5, before recovering restitution as a"victim" in this case. The agreements to surrender theanimals signed by HHS and MONTGOMERY in this matter,contractually "waive[d] and release[d] such claims againstMONTGOMERY for monetary recovery pursuant" to H.R.S §§ 711-1109.1, 711-1109.2 or 711-1110.5. See Exhibit "C,"paragraph 2 of the "Animal Surrender Agreement." 
"A trial court's conclusions of law are reviewed de 
novo under the right/wrong standard." State v. Adler, 108 
Hawai# i 169, 174, 118 P.3d 652, 657 (2005) (citation omitted). 
The State first argues that the plain language of HRS 
§ 706-646 does not create a statutory requirement that HHS impound, hold, or receive custody of a pet animal pursuant to HRS §§ 711-1109.1, 711-1109.2, or 711-1110.5 to be considered a "victim." The State contends that instead of requiring affirmative conduct by an entity, the reference to HRS §§ 711-1109.1, 711-1109.2, or 711-1110.5 only acts as providing a "standardized definition" for what constitutes a "victim" under the section. 
The State further purports that even if the 
language imposes a requirement for affirmative conduct, it only applies to the hypothetical entity of a duly incorporated society for the prevention of cruelty to animals, which is distinct from and inapplicable to HHS. The State then argues that even if such a statutory requirement exists and applies to HHS, HHS met that requirement and thus was entitled to recover restitution. 
We first address what requirements must be met for an 
entity to be considered a "victim" under the language of HRS § 706-646(1)(d) (2014). HRS § 706-646(1)(d) provides:
§706-646 Victim restitution.  (1) As used in this 
section, "victim" includes any of the following: 
. . . 
(d) Any duly incorporated humane society or duly
incorporated society for the prevention of cruelty toanimals, contracted with the county or State toenforce animal-related statutes or ordinances, thatimpounds, holds, or receives custody of a pet animalpursuant to section 711-1109.1, 711-1109.2, or711-1110.5; provided that this section does not applyto costs that have already been contracted andprovided for by the counties or State. 
2    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
We read the plain language of HRS § 706-646(1)(d) as establishing 
a category of "victim" that must meet three requirements to be entitled to restitution. The entity must: (1) be a "duly incorporated humane society or duly incorporated society for the prevention of cruelty to animals"; (2) be "contracted with the county or State to enforce animal-related statutes or ordinances"; and (3) "impound[], hold[], or receive[] custody of a pet animal pursuant to [HRS] section 711-1109.1, 711-1109.2, or 711-1110.5[.]" If any of these factors are not met, the entity is not classified as a "victim" and not entitled to restitution under HRS § 706-646(1)(d).
2 
We next address whether HHS met the requirements to be 
classified as a "victim" under HRS § 706-646(1)(d). In this case, the parties dispute whether HHS acted pursuant to HRS § 711-1109.1 (Supp. 2015).  The State contends that HHS acted 
3
2 Our plain language reading of HRS § 706-646(1)(d) is further
supported by the House Standing Committee Report on the bill that added humane
societies as a classification of "victim" for purposes of restitution. House Bill No. 235 (H.B. No. 235) was introduced in the Hawai #i legislature in 2013
and enacted into law as Act 207. 2013 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 207, at 649. The Committee on Judiciary and Consumer Protection & Commerce amended the bill by"[l]imiting the applicability of the new category of 'victim' to thosesocieties that impound, hold, or receive custody of a pet animal pursuant toonly three specified sections in the criminal laws relating to offensesagainst public order concerning animal cruelty[.]" 
H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No.
719, in 2013 House Journal, at 1153-54. Thus, the legislature specificallyintended that an entity must act pursuant to HRS § 711-1109.1, 711-1109.2, or711-1110.5 to be considered a "victim" under this subsection. 
3 HRS § 711-1109.1 provides: 
§711-1109.1  A uthority  to  enter  premises;  notice  of
impoundment  of  animal;  damage  resulting  from  entry.   (1)  I f
there  is  probable  cause  to  believe  that  a  pet  animal  or  equine
animal  is  being  subjected  to  treatment  in  violation  of  section
711-1108.5,  711-1109,  711-1109.3,  711-1109.6,  or  711-1109.35,
as  applicable,  a  law  enforcement  officer,  after  obtaining  a
search  warrant,  or  in  any  other  manner  authorized  by  law,  may
enter  the  premises  where  the  pet  animal  or  equine  animal  is
located  to  provide  the  pet  animal  or  equine  animal  with  food,
water,  and  emergency  medical  treatment  or  to  impound  the  pet
animal  or  equine  animal.   If  after  reasonable  effort,  the
owner  or  person  having  custody  of  the  pet  animal  or  equine
animal  cannot  be  found  and  notified  of  the  impoundment,  an
impoundment  notice  shall  be  conspicuously  posted  on  the
premises  and  within  seventy-two  hours  after  posting,  the
notice  shall  be  sent  by  certified  mail  to  the  address,  if  any,
from  which  the  pet  animal  or  equine  animal  was  removed. 
(2)   A  l aw  enforcement  officer  is  not  liable  for  any
damage  resulting  from  an  entry  under  subsection  (1),  unless
the  damage  resulted  from  intentional  or  reckless  behavior  on
behalf  of  the  law  enforcement  officer.

pursuant to HRS § 711-1109.1 when an HHS investigator entered 
Montgomery's premises with probable cause, viewed the contents of a trash can in plain view and with a tenant's consent, saw that there was a dog in a state of medical necessity, and transported the dog to receive emergency medical treatment. Montgomery responds that HRS § 711-1109.1 requires HHS to have impounded the dog. Montgomery further contends that HHS did not impound the dog because Montgomery had surrendered the dog to HHS pursuant to an Animal Surrender Admissions Form (Surrender Form) before HHS transported the dog off the premises and any expenses were incurred for its care. 
According to the HHS investigator's testimony, 
Montgomery executed a Surrender Form and agreed to surrender the dog to HHS before the dog was taken to the HHS shelter for medical examination. The Surrender Form stated: 
I, James Montgomery, declare that I am the legal and
rightful owner of the above animal. I hereby surrender thisanimal to the Hawaiian Humane Society and release all rightsand ownership of the animal to the Hawaiian Humane Society.I agree that the final disposition of the animal(s)specified above may include adoption or euthanasia at thediscretion of the Hawaiian humane Society. 
Upon Montgomery's execution of the Surrender Form, Montgomery 
relinquished his legal ownership of the dog and HHS received full title and legal ownership of the dog. Montgomery could not incur further costs for the dog after such surrender. Accordingly, any costs incurred by HHS in caring for the dog after Montgomery's surrender cannot be recovered. 
Although HHS was generally acting within the authority 
granted under HRS § 711-1109.1 when it entered the premises after being notified that a pet animal was being subjected to treatment in violation of HRS § 711-1108.5, HHS did not impound, hold, or receive custody of the dog pursuant to HRS § 711-1109.1. Rather, HHS took ownership of the dog pursuant to the Surrender 
(3) A court may order a pet animal or equine animal
impounded under subsection (1) to be held at a duly
incorporated humane society or duly incorporated society forthe prevention of cruelty to animals. A facility receivingthe pet animal or equine animal shall provide adequate foodand water and may provide veterinary care. 
(4) For purposes of this section, "law enforcement
officer" shall have the same meaning as [in] section 710-1000.

Agreement. 
With these facts, we conclude that HHS did not impound, 
hold, or receive custody of the dog pursuant to HRS §§ 711-
1109.1, 711-1109.2 (court-ordered forfeiture), or 711-1110.5 (surrender or forfeiture upon a defendant's conviction, guilty plea, or plea of nolo contendere for any violation of HRS §§ 711-1108.5, 711-1109, 711-1109.3, 711-1109.6, or 711-1109.35). Thus, the circuit court was correct in concluding as a matter of law that HHS was not a "victim" as defined under HRS § 706-646(1)(d) and did not err in denying HHS's requested restitution. 
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Order Denying 
Hawaiian Humane Society's Requested Restitution, filed on October 16, 2017, in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit.
