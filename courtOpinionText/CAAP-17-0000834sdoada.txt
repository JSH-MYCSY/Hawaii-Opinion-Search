IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
CHRIS SLAVICK, Petitioner-Appellant,
v. 
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Respondent-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(SPP. NO. 16-1-0004; CR. NO. 04-1-1534) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Chan, JJ.) 
Petitioner-Appellant Chris Slavick (Slavick) appeals 
pro se from the October 10, 2019 Order Denying Petition to 
Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner 
From Custody (Order Denying Petition) entered by the Circuit 
Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court).1 
In his Opening Brief, Slavick raises various "Issues on 
Appeal," but fails to identify points of error and otherwise 
fails to comply with Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 
1 The Honorable Karen T. Nakasone presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Rule 28(b)(4). Nevertheless, in light of Slavick's pro se  status 
and in the interest of justice, we address the discernible issues 
raised in this appeal. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve Slavick's contentions as follows: 
1. Minimum Term of Imprisonment 
Slavick argues that the Hawai# i Paroling Authority 
(
HPA) erred in setting his minimum term of imprisonment. 
However, Slavick's arguments on this point are moot without exception because his minimum term expired on April 10, 2019. See In re Carl Corp. v. State, Dep't of Educ., 93 Hawai# i 155, 
164, 997 P.2d 567, 576 (2000). See also Right to Know Comm. v. City Council, 117 Hawai# i 1, 8, 175 P.3d 111, 118 (App. 2007); 
Hopkins v. State, CAAP-12-0000230, 2013 WL 4522598, *1 (Haw. App. Aug. 23, 2013) (SDO); Fukumoto v. State, CAAP-11-0000791, 2012 WL 5897411, *1 (Haw. App. Nov. 21, 2012) (SDO). 
2. Judicial Bias – Judge Nakasone 
Slavick argues that Judge Nakasone, who denied 
Slavick's February 18, 2016 Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner From Custody, and June 21, 2017 Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to 
Release Petitioner From Custody (Petition
), "confessed to her 
being conflicted and partial due to her involvement, at least, in 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Civil cases 1CC151001557 and 1CC151001683" and "since both of the 
latter Civil cases preceded CR 13-1-1461 and SPP 16-1-0004 regarding the assignment/involvement of [J]udge Nakasone with her then conceding her disqualification in CR 13-1-1461, likewise, [J]udge Nakasone is also disqualified from SPP 16-1-00004 and her denial of my Petition is null and void." 
Slavick does not state where in the record Judge 
Nakasone indicated she had a conflict of interest or that Slavick moved Judge Nakasone to recuse herself, and we find no evidence of such in the record. See HRAP Rule 28(b)(4)(ii) and (iii). 
Moreover, a judge's involvement in prior cases involving the same defendant does not necessarily create a conflict of interest. Therefore, Slavick has failed to demonstrate clearly and precisely that Judge Nakasone was prejudiced against him. See 
State v. Birano, 109 Hawai# i 314, 323, 126 P.3d 357, 366 (2006). 
3. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel 
Slavick argues that Earl Partington (Partington), who 
represented Slavick on direct appeal, provided Slavick with ineffective assistance for refusing "to cite meritorious appeal issues that [Slavick] raised to him."   Slavick argues, among

Partington failed to cite that [Respondent-Appellee
State of Hawai #i (State )] never carried any burden for
the mistrial and the prosecution utilized the trial as
a preview of the defense. [Partington] failed toraise the significant and obvious issue of theprosecution using a new expert witness, an alternatetheory, and new evidence of an interview audio

2other things, that Richard Gronna (Gronna), Slavick's stand-by 
counsel at retrial, failed to timely file a Motion for New 
Trial/Rule 33 and Motion for Acquittal/Rule 29(c), refused to communicate with Slavick so that Slavick could prepare for retrial, refused to assist Slavick zealously and at crucial times during retrial,  and improperly apprised the prosecution about 
Slavick's evidence and trial strategy.

Based on the record before this court, it is unclear 
whether counsels' actions reflected "specific errors or omissions reflecting [a] lack of skill, judgment, or diligence." State v. Aplaca, 74 Haw. 54, 67, 837 P.2d 1298, 1305 (1992); see Loher v. State, 118 Hawai# i 522, 534, 193 P.3d 438, 450 (App. 2008), 
overruled on other grounds in State v. Auld, 136 
Hawai# i 244, 361 
P.3d 471 (2015) ("[I]n the absence of a sufficient record on this 
(...continued)
recording that they chose not to use at trial, yet
they then used at retrial in order to enhance theirability to convict -- such tactics are flagrantviolations of the Double Jeopardy Clause and arestrictly forbidden. . . . . Further evidence of ineffectiveness was [Partington's] failure to citeprosecutor misconduct when DPA Yamane falsely claimedto the jury that she was quoting Slavick to have said"Yeah, I read them" as she referenced the medicationlabel in this instant case[.] . . . . [Partington]even committed FRAUD in his Opening Brief[.] . . . .[H]e also failed to appeal the failure by [retrialstand-by counsel, Richard Gronna] to timely file theMotion for New Trial/Rule 33 and Motion forAcquittal/Rule 29(c)[.] . . . . Partington attemptedto prejudicially harm Slavick's appeal case. 
3 Slavick's first trial resulted in a mistrial, and he was
subsequently retried and convicted of Promoting a Harmful Drug in the FirstDegree, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes § 712-1244(1)(a), forpossessing ten or more capsules, tablets, or doses, of methandrostenolene
(methandienone), a steroid. Judge Karen S.S. Ahn ( Judge Ahn ) presided over
the retrial.

appeal, including an opportunity for Loher's former appellate 
counsel to be heard, we must remand for the development of such a record on the issue of whether Loher had ineffective assistance of appellate counsel."). We conclude that the Circuit Court erred by denying the Petition without holding a hearing on these issues. 
Slavick waived his remaining arguments because he 
failed to raise them on direct appeal and does not present extraordinary circumstances justifying his failure to raise them. 
See Hawai# i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40(a)(3). See 
also, e.g., Stanley v. State, 76 Hawai# i 446, 451, 879 P.2d 551, 
556 (1994); Loher, 118 Hawai# i at 531, 193 P.3d at 447. In any 
case, as discussed below, it appears that Slavick's further 
arguments lack merit. 
4. Prosecutorial Misconduct 
a. Slavick's Cross-Examination 
Slavick argues that counsel for the State committed 
prosecutorial misconduct by continuously objecting during 
Slavick's cross-examination of pharmacist Kevin Ho (Ho), and that 
the State and Circuit Court committed misconduct by obstructing 
Slavick's opening statement and his cross-examination of U.S. 
Border and Customs agent Gail Fukunaga (Fukunaga).  However, 
during Slavick's opening statement, the State objected numerous 
times on the basis that Slavick was presenting arguments, and the 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Circuit Court sustained most of the objections. Slavick did not 
claim that the prosecutor or court were committing misconduct. 
Further, during Slavick's cross-examination of 
Fukunaga, counsel for the State articulated bases for all but four of her objections, and Slavick did not complain that counsel was committing prosecutorial misconduct. During Slavick's cross-examination of Ho, the State's counsel articulated a basis for all but one of her objections, and, again, Slavick did not object. See State v. Vliet, 91 Hawai# i 288, 299, 983 P.2d 189, 
200 (1999) ("A complete failure to object will waive the point[.]"). 
b. State's Closing Argument 
Slavick appears to argue that the Circuit Court 
erroneously rejected his claim that the prosecution misquoted him to the jury (as saying "Yeah, I read them"), in reference to the labels on the pharmacy bottles, and played an interview recording to "coincide" with her misstatement to falsely prove Slavick possessed the requisite "knowing" state of mind. However, during closing argument, a prosecutor is "permitted to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence and wide latitude is allowed in discussing the evidence." State v. Klinge, 92 Hawai# i 577, 592, 
994 P.2d 509, 524 (2000) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
Further, there was evidence that Slavick read the 
labels, and "it is . . . within the bounds of legitimate argument for prosecutors to state, discuss, and comment on the evidence as 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 well as to draw all reasonable inferences from the evidence." 
Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
5. Jury Instructions on Mistake of Fact and Mistake
of Law 
Slavick argues the trial court erroneously instructed 
the jury on mistake of fact and mistake of law, which Slavick did 
not request and which was inconsistent with his defense. However, at retrial, no party objected to jury instruction No. 34 (Mistake of Fact) being given, and the State, not Slavick, objected to the jury instruction No. 35 (Mistake of Law). Slavick did not object when the Circuit Court gave the jury the instructions. See Vliet, 91 Hawai# i at 298-99, 983 P.2d at 199-
200. Slavick does not contend that the instructions were a wrong 
statement of the law. We conclude that Slavick's argument is without merit. 
6. Transcripts 
Slavick argues that the Circuit Court erred and 
violated his rights to due process and confrontation when it failed "to provide and . . . assure that first trial transcripts [were] provided to [Slavick] in order for him to have any meaningful opportunity to prepare" for his retrial. Slavick fails to meet his burden to cite to where in the record that he requested the transcripts or informed the Circuit Court that he did not receive them. See HRAP Rule 28(b)(4)(ii) and (iii); 
State v. Adler, 108 Hawai# i 169, 178, 118 P.3d 642, 661 (2005). 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
    Regardless, the record does not support Slavick's claim that he 
was deprived of the trial transcripts prior to retrial. 
Further, at retrial, Slavick did not claim that he had 
not been provided with the first trial transcripts or that he had inadequate time to review the transcripts, and Slavick used several transcripts during cross-examination of the State's witnesses. This argument is without merit. 
7. Interview CD 
Slavick argues that the Circuit Court broke its promise 
to allow him to utilize the court's audio equipment the week of February 4, 2013, so he could listen to a CD of an October 28, 2003 interview of him, since he lacked the means to do so in prison, and he was unable to hear the recording until the day before or of trial. Slavick does not show where in the record the Circuit Court made such a promise. See HRAP Rule 
28(b)(4)(ii). The record shows that Slavick was provided with an opportunity to listen to the CD of the interview one day prior to the retrial and he did not object or request a trial continuance on the ground that he had an inadequate amount of time to review the CD. See Vliet, 91 Hawai# i at 298-99, 983 P.2d at 199-200. 
The Circuit Court did not err in rejecting this argument. 
8. Discovery Violation 
Slavick appears to argue that during discovery, the 
prosecution provided him with a transcript of an October 28, 2003 interview with him, in which the words "sell them over here" had 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
been falsely attributed to Slavick to prove he possessed the 
requisite intent. However, a transcript of the interview was not offered or received into evidence and, therefore, any error was harmless. 
9. Judicial Bias – Judge Ahn 
Slavick argues that prior to retrial, on October 17, 
2012, Circuit Court Judge Ahn exhibited bias against him when she said, "'if you were a person that I felt: A, would not reoffend:' as she distinctly refers to the charge of 'promoting a harmful drug' with her specific alphabetical separation." However, the record makes clear that the remark pertained to the grounds for denying Slavick's request to reduce bail and was not a pronouncement regarding his guilt. Slavick has not shown "a clear and precise demonstration of prejudice." Birano, 109 
Hawai# i at 323, 126 P.3d at 366 (block quotation format and 
citation omitted). 
Therefore, this argument is without merit. 
10. Perjury by State's Witnesses 
Slavick argues that the State's witnesses perjured 
themselves at retrial. However, Slavick did not raise these issues in the Petition and fails to demonstrate grounds for their review on this appeal. 
Accordingly, we decline to address these 
issues. 
For these reasons, this case is remanded to the Circuit 
Court for a hearing pursuant to Hawai# i Rules of Penal Procedure 
Rule 40 on Slavick's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and in all other respects, the Circuit Court's October 10, 2019
Order Denying Petition is affirmed.
