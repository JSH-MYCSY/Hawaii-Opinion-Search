SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Reifurth and Chan, JJ.)
In this appeal arising out of a foreclosure action,
Defendant-Appellant Charito Labrador Hermano (Hermano) appeals
from the October 16, 2017 "Order Denying Defendant Charito
Labrador Hermano's Motion to Vacate the Findings of Fact,
Conclusions of Law, Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary
Judgment Against All Parties and for Interlocutory Decree of
Foreclosure Filed March 5, 2013; and the January 31, 2013 Order
Dismissing the Counterclaim, Filed March 16, 2017" (Order DenyingNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Motion to Vacate), filed in the Circuit Court of the First
Circuit (circuit court).1
On appeal, Hermano argues that the circuit court erred
by declining to apply the legal principles established in Bank of
America, N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai #i 361, 390 P.3d 1248
(2017) (Reyes-Toledo I) to the instant matter, and as a result
violated her constitutional rights to due process and equal
protection of the laws.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude
Hermano's appeal is without merit.
On January 31, 2012, Plaintiff-Appellee Bank of
America, N.A., successor by merger to BAC Home Loans Servicing,
LP fka Countrywide Home Loans Servicing LP (Bank of America)
initiated this foreclosure action in the circuit court,  seeking
to foreclose upon Hermano's property.2
On October 22, 2012, Hermano filed an answer and
counterclaim.  Hermano's counterclaim asserted several counts
arising from the contention that Bank of America was not the
owner and holder of the subject note and mortgage: (1) wrongful
foreclosure; (2) declaratory relief; (3) quiet title; and (4)
unfair and deceptive trade practices.
On January 31, 2013, the circuit court filed its "Order
Granting Counterclaim Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Counterclaim
Filed on October 22, 2012" (Order Dismissing Counterclaim).
On November 14, 2013, the circuit court filed its
"Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Order Granting Plaintiff's
Motion for Summary Judgment Against All Parties and for

pertaining to the Order Denying Motion to Vacate.

2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure Filed March 5, 2013" (Summary
Judgment/Foreclosure Decree), in favor of Bank of America.  The
circuit court also entered Judgment pursuant to the Summary
Judgment/Foreclosure Decree (Foreclosure Judgment) on the same
day.
On December 12, 2013, Hermano appealed from the
Foreclosure Judgment.  This court, in Bank of America, N.A. v.
Hermano, No. CAAP 13-0006069, 2016 WL 3524547 (Haw. App. June 22,
2016) (SDO) (Hermano I), cert. denied, SCWC-13-0006069, 2016 WL
5231842 (Haw. Sept. 22, 2016), affirmed the circuit court's
Foreclosure Judgment.  In that prior appeal, we, inter alia ,
affirmed the circuit court's dismissal of Hermano's counterclaim
and declined Hermano's argument that Bank of America had no
standing to bring the foreclosure action.  Id. at *4, *8.  The
Hawai#i Supreme Court denied Hermano's application for writ of
certiorari.  Bank of America, N.A. v. Hermano, SCWC-13-0006069,
2016 WL 5231842 (Haw. Sept. 22, 2016).
Subsequent to our decision in Hermano I and rejection
of the application for writ of certiorari, the Hawai #i Supreme
Court issued its decision in Reyes-Toledo I, holding that in
order to establish a right to foreclose in a judicial foreclosure
action, the foreclosing plaintiff must establish standing, or
entitlement to enforce the subject note, at the time the action
was commenced.  139 Hawai#i at 367-70, 390 P.3d at 1254-57.
On March 16, 2017, shortly after the supreme court
filed its Reyes-Toledo I decision, Hermano filed a motion to
vacate the Summary Judgment/Foreclosure Decree and the Order
Dismissing Counterclaim (Motion to Vacate), pursuant to Hawai #i
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 60(b), asserting that Reyes-
Toledo I resolved the very issues Hermano raised in her
counterclaim and in her opposition to the Summary
Judgment/Foreclosure Decree.  In Hermano's memorandum in support
of her Motion to Vacate, Hermano argued:
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
The [Summary Judgment/Foreclosure Decree] must be vacated
under [HRCP] Rule 60(b)(2),(3),(4) and (6) because of newly
discovered case law, misconduct of the adverse party, and
misrepresentation claiming that they owned Defendant's
mortgage and note.  Therefore the judgment is void.  The
Hawai[#]i Supreme Court opinion [in Reyes-Toledo I] is a
valid reason justifying vacating all of those decisions of
this Court.  In addition, the Court should also vacate the
[Order Dismissing Counterclaim] because that issue was also
resolved by the Reyes-Toledo [I] case sending the issue back
to the Intermediate Court of Appeals [(ICA)] for further
review when the ICA determined it lacked jurisdiction to
review that appeal on the dismissal of Reyes-Toledo's
counterclaim.
The circuit court issued its Order Denying Motion to
Vacate on October 16, 2017.  In denying the Motion to Vacate, the
circuit court rejected Hermano's request to apply Reyes-Toledo I
retroactively.  The circuit court found:
In moving to dismiss [Hermano's] Counterclaim filed
November 28, 2012, [Bank of America] relied on well-
established precedent in arguing that production of the
original Note was not required to initiate foreclosure
proceedings.  Similarly, [Bank of America] relied on well-
established precedent that it was only required to establish
its entitlement to enforce the Note when moving for Summary
Judgment, not when it initiated the foreclosure proceedings. 
Plaintiff significantly relied upon well-established
precedent, which is now at odds with Reyes-Toledo [I], in
both instances.
. . . .
[Bank of America's] reliance on the well-established
precedent prior to Reyes-Toledo was significant and [Bank of
America] could not have foreseen that the law would
drastically change.  Given that [Bank of America] would have
been substantially prejudiced by the retrospective
application of the new legal principles established in
Reyes-Toledo [I], such prejudice can be avoided by giving
those principles prospective application only.
The circuit court further stated: "The Court denies the instant
motion only under the circumstances presented here, where
Defendant has appealed the circuit court's ruling, the ruling was
affirmed, and writ of certiorari denied."
Hermano timely filed her appeal from the Order Denying
Motion to Vacate.  On appeal, Hermano argues that the circuit
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
court should have granted her Motion to Vacate pursuant to HRCP
Rule 60(b)(2), (3), (4), and (6).3
We review a trial court's denial of an HRCP Rule
60(b)(2), (3), or (6) motion to set aside a judgment or order
under the abuse of discretion standard:
It is well settled that the trial court has a very large
measure of discretion in passing upon motions under Hawai #i
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 60(b) and its order
will not be set aside unless we are persuaded that under the
circumstances of the particular case, the court's refusal to
set aside its order was an abuse of discretion.
Hawai#i Hous. Auth. v. Uyehara, 77 Hawai#i 144, 147, 883 P.2d 65,
68 (1994) (brackets omitted) (quoting Paxton v. State, 2 Haw.
App. 46, 48, 625 P.2d 1052, 1054 (1981)).  An "abuse of
discretion occurs if the trial court has clearly exceeded the
bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles of law or
practice to the substantial detriment of a party-litigant."
State v. Jackson, 81 Hawai# i 39, 47, 912 P.2d 71, 79 (1996)
(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  The
determination of whether a judgment is void under HRCP Rule
60(b)(4) is not a discretionary issue, and we review the trial
court's ruling on an HRCP Rule 60(b)(4) motion de novo .
Cvitanovichâ€“Dubie v. Dubie, 125 Hawai# i 128, 139, 254 P.3d 439,
450 (2011) (discussing Hawai#i Family Court Rules (HFCR) Rule
60(b)); Wagner v. World Botanical Gardens, Inc., 126 Hawai#i 190,
3HRCP Rule 60(b) provides, in relevant part:
On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may
relieve a party or a party's legal representative from a final
judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons:
. . . (2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence
could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial
under Rule 59(b); (3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated
intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other
misconduct of an adverse party; (4) the judgment is void;
. . . or (6) any other reason justifying relief from the
operation of the judgment.  The motion shall be made within a
reasonable time, and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) not more
than one year after the judgment, order, or proceeding was
entered or taken.

195, 268 P.3d 443, 448 (App. 2011) (discussing Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure (FRCP) Rule 60(b)).4
In the present appeal, Hermano again seeks relief from
the Summary Judgment/Foreclosure Decree and the Order Dismissing
Counterclaim, which she challenged in Hermano I.  Hermano's
Motion to Vacate presented the same claims that we adjudicated on
the merits in Hermano I.
"Res judicata . . . limit[s] a litigant to one
opportunity to litigate aspects of the case to prevent
inconsistent results and multiplicity of suits and to promote
finality and judicial economy."  E. Sav. Bank, FSB v. Esteban,
129 Hawai #i 154, 158, 296 P.3d 1062, 1066 (2013) (citing Dorrance
v. Lee, 90 Hawai#i 143, 148-49, 976 P.2d 904, 909-10 (1999)).
The doctrine prohibits parties from "relitigating a previously
adjudicated cause of action."  Id. (citing Bremer v. Weeks, 104
Hawai#i 43, 54, 85 P.3d 150, 161 (2004)).
Upon the supreme court's rejection of Hermano's
application for writ of certiorari, our decision in Hermano I
became the final decision on the merits and the Foreclosure
Judgment became final and binding.  See Hawai #i Rules of
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 36(d)(2).  The doctrine of res
judicata  precludes Hermano from relitigating the validity of the
Summary Judgment/Foreclosure Decree and the Order Dismissing
Counterclaim as these challenges were subsumed under the
Foreclosure Judgment.  See Cent. Pac. Bank v. Frederick, No.
CAAP-16-0000637, 2017 WL 2852733, at *2 (Haw. App. June 30, 2017)
(SDO), cert. denied, No. SCWC-16-0000637, 2017 WL 4857129 (Haw.
Oct. 26, 2017).  Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in
denying Hermano's Motion to Vacate.
4HRCP Rule 60(b) is substantially similar to HFCR Rule 60(b) and
materially similar to FRCP Rule 60(b).  Wagner, 126 Hawai#i at 194 n.3, 268 P.3d
at 447 n.3.  Thus, "cases interpreting HFCR Rule 60(b) and FRCP Rule 60(b) are
persuasive for purposes of interpreting HRCP Rule 60(b)."  Id.; see
Cvitanovich-Dubie, 125 Hawai#i at 142 n.15, 254 P.3d at 453 n.15.
