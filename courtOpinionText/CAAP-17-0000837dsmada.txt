IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI #I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
PATRICK H. OKI, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CR. NO. 1PC151000488 (15-1-0488))
ORDER GRANTING FEBRUARY 21, 2018 MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL
WITHOUT PREJUDICE FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
Upon consideration of (1) Defendant-Appellant 
Patrick H. Oki's (Oki) February 21, 2018 motion to dismiss
appellate court case number CAAP-17-0000837 without prejudice for
lack of appellate jurisdiction, (2) the lack of any response by
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai# i to Appellant Oki's February
21, 2018 motion, and (3) the record, it appears that we lack
appellate jurisdiction over Appellant Oki's appeal from the
Honorable Rom A. Trader's October 17, 2017 judgment of conviction
against Oki because the October 17, 2017 judgment of conviction
indicates that the circuit court intends to rule on an unresolved
issue whether Oki should pay restitution as a part of the circuit
court's sentence against him.
Under analogous circumstances involving an appeal from
a district court judgment of conviction that expressed the
district court's intent to impose restitution against the
defendant at some time in the future, this court held that theNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
judgment of conviction was not appealable.  State v. Kilborn , 109
Hawai#i 435, 442, 127 P.3d 95, 102 (App. 2005).  The statute that
authorizes appeals from district court criminal cases is HRS
ยง 641-12 (2016), which differs from HRS ยง 641-11 in that HRS
ยง 641-12 does not expressly refer to the "sentence" as the
judgment, but the Kilborn  court explained that "a document is not
a judgment of conviction unless it includes the adjudication and
the sentence" in either a circuit court criminal case or a
district court criminal case because "we are unaware of any
reason why, with respect to this particular issue, there should
be a difference between circuit court judgments and district
court judgment."  Kilborn  109 Hawai #i at 441-42, 127 P.3d at 101-
02.  In Kilborn , the district court had entered a December 5,
2003 judgment of conviction against the defendant, Kilborn, for
leaving the scene of an accident involving damage to a vehicle or
property in violation of HRS ยง 291C-13 (1993) that sentenced
Kilborn to a fine of $100.00 and various fees, and, in addition,
"[t]he [December 5, 2003] Judgment ordered a hearing on
restitution to occur on February 5, 2004.  The notice of appeal[,
however] was filed on January 5, 2004."  Kilborn, 109 Hawai# i at
437, 127 P.3d at 97 (emphasis added).  In other words, Kilborn
filed the notice of appeal before the district court had an
opportunity to follow up on the express provision in the
December 5, 2003 judgment stating that the district court
intended to hold a hearing regarding restitution.  On appeal, the
Kilborn court held that
[j]udgments of conviction are not final unless they include
the final adjudication and the final sentence.  In the
instant case, the sentence imposed was not the final
sentence because the district court expressly left open the
possibility that its sentence of Kilborn 
might include an
order requiring Kilborn to pay 
restitution.  The court did
not finally decide whether it would order Kilborn to pay
restitution and, if so, in what amount.  
Consequently, the
December 5, 2003 Judgment is not final and, because it is
not final, it is not appealable.
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal from
the December 5, 2003 Judgment is dismissed for lack of
appellate jurisdiction.
Id. at 442, 127 P.3d at 102 (emphases added).
-2-NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Similar to the circumstances in Kilborn , the
October 17, 2017 judgment of conviction does not contain the
circuit court's entire sentence for Oki because it indicates the
circuit court's intent to determine on some future date the issue
whether Oki must pay restitution as a part of his sentence. 
Consequently, the October 17, 2017 judgment did not terminate the
proceedings in Oki's criminal case.  Absent an appealable final
judgment of conviction against Oki, we lack appellate
jurisdiction, and Oki's appeal is premature.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellant Oki's
February 21, 2018 motion to dismiss his appeal for lack of
appellate jurisdiction is granted, and appellate court case
number CAAP-17-0000837 is dismissed without prejudice to Oki
timely appealing from a future appealable final judgment of
conviction in Criminal No. 1PC151000488 that resolves the
lingering issue of restitution.
