 summary judgment2 and the October 23, 2017 Judgment.  Based on 
the discussion below, we affirm in part and vacate in part.        
I. Background 
In 2006, the Saplans and their son, Ricky Saplan 
(Ricky) purchased a lot on Ho‘ olana Place in Kona (the Property) 
as tenants in common, each with an undivided 1/3 interest.  The 
Saplans and Ricky signed a promissory note for $475,200.00 with 
National City Bank secured by a mortgage for the Property and, 
at some point, defaulted on the note.  In 2009, National City Bank assigned the mortgage on the Property to U.S. Bank.  A 
short time later, Rosalinda wrote a letter to a negotiator at 
National City Bank stating she no longer occupied the Property. 
U.S. Bank, in its capacity as Trustee, later gave a 
limited power of attorney to PNC Bank, National Association and 
PNC Mortgage (
PNC), which was recorded in the Bureau of 
Conveyances on February 1, 2010.  On January 5, 2011, PNC's 
"Notice of Mortgagee's Intention to Foreclose under Power of 
Sale" was recorded in the Bureau of Conveyances. 
On March 10, 2011, PNC conducted a non-judicial 
foreclosure sale where PNC bought the property for $288,000.00.

U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee for BAFC 2007- A's Motion for

 A "Mortgagee's Quitclaim Deed Pursuant to Power of Sale" was 
recorded in the Bureau of Conveyances on July 22, 2011, 
conveying the Property to U.S. Bank. 
There is no evidence in the record on appeal that 
shows the Saplans challenged the foreclosure sale. A.  2011 Action - U.S. Bank's Complaint for Ejectment  
in Circuit Court  
 
In 2011, U.S. Bank filed a complaint in the Circuit 
Court of the Third Circuit entitled "Complaint for Ejectment; 
Exhibits '1' and '2'; Foreclosure Mediation Notice; Foreclosure Mediation Request; Summons[.]" 
The Saplans moved to dismiss the complaint, which the 
circuit court denied. 
In its pretrial statement, U.S. Bank asserted that the 
"Mortgagee's Quitclaim Deed Pursuant to Power of Sale 
transferring title of said real property to [U.S Bank] was 
recorded in the Bureau of Conveyances" on July 22, 2011.  U.S. 
Bank also asserted that the Saplans, Luku Amone (Luku), and 
Rehna Amone (Rehna)
3 were "still remaining on the property as 
trespassers and/or uninvited guests and lessees." 
On August 2, 2013, the circuit court entered an order 
dismissing the case as to all parties "pursuant to Rule 12(q) of

About a year later, on April 24, 2014, U.S. Bank filed 
a "Verified Complaint for Summary Possession and Ejectment" in 
the District Court of the Third Circuit.  The complaint named as 
defendants the Saplans, Ricky, and John and Jane Does 1-50, and 
alleged that the Saplans, Ricky, and others remained on the property.  U.S. Bank asserted the following claims:

Count 2 "Tenants of Former Owner - Tenants at Sufferance" – U.S. Bank alleged that 
tenants of former owners rights to occupy

Count 3  "Trespassers" – U.S. Bank alleged that trespassers never had right to occupy the Property and are liable for payment. 
 
(Emphasis omitted.) 
As it acknowledges in its answering brief, U.S. Bank 
dismissed the Saplans from the 2014 Action on May 20, 2014. 
Three months later, the district court entered a 
judgment for possession stating U.S. Bank was entitled to the 
property and a writ of possession would be issued pursuant to 
HRS § 666-11 (Supp. 2013).6  Both the judgment and the writ had

may bring an action in the nature of summary possession under chapter 666, ejectment, or trespass or may bring any

 the Saplans' names crossed out.  The writ of possession was 
served on Ricky and Latasha Ortiz (Ortiz) on November 5, 2014 
and filed on November 20, 2014, concluding the case. 
U.S. Bank conveyed the property to a third party by a 
special warranty deed recorded in the Bureau of Conveyances on 
March 30, 2015. 
C. 2015 Action - Saplans' Complaint in This Case  
in Circuit Court 
 
  On July 27, 2015, the Saplans filed a Verified 
Complaint, claiming the following: 
Count 1 Quiet Title, alleging they were the true
owners of the Property;  
 
Count 2 Ejectment, seeking a writ of ejectment 
against U.S. Bank pursuant to HRS § 603-36
(1993);  
 
Count 3 Trespass, alleging U.S. Bank "and/or its agents or assignees remain[ed] on the [P]roperty as trespassers"; 
 
Count 4 Fraud on the Court, alleging that U.S. Bank "concealed from the Court when securing its writ of possession in the 2014 Case that identical claims had 
already been dismissed with prejudice in 
the 2011 Case"; 
 
 
(. . . continued) 
 
The writ of possession shall issue to the sheriff, deputy 
sheriff, police officer, or independent civil process 
server from the department of public safety's list under 
section 353C- 10, commanding the sheriff, deputy sheriff, 
police officer, or independent civil process server to 
remove all persons from the premises, and to put the 
plaintiff, or the plaintiff's agent, into full possession 
thereof. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

   Count 5 Unjust Enrichment, asserting that they 
were entitled to monetary compensation if 
title could not be quieted due to transfer 
"to a bona fide purchaser" and;  
 
Count 6 Punitive Damages, asserting that U.S. Bank was indifferent to their "finances, health, and well-being[.]" 
 
  U.S. Bank moved for summary judgment arguing that 
"(1) the Saplans' claims are barred by res judicata and the 
doctrines of estoppel, laches and mootness, and judicial 
estoppel; and (2) they cannot establish the necessary element of 
title to the Property."  (Emphasis omitted.) 
The Saplans filed a memorandum in opposition 
contending U.S. Bank itself was precluded by res judicata, the 2011 Action adjudicated title in their favor, they did not 
unreasonably delay in filing the case, and U.S. Bank did not 
indicate "any inconsistent position taken by" them. 
  Following a hearing, the circuit court granted U.S. 
Bank's motion for summary judgment and entered the Judgment in 
favor of U.S. Bank. 
II. Standard of Review 
  We review the grant or denial of summary judgment de novo.  Nuuanu Valley Ass'n v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 119

 III.  Discussion 
In their sole point of error on appeal, the Saplans 
contend that the circuit court erred in granting U.S. Bank's 
motion for summary judgment. 
The movant for summary judgment bears the initial 
burden of establishing entitlement to summary judgment.  See 
Ralston v. Yim, 129 Hawai‘ i 46, 59-61, 292 P.3d 1276, 1289-91 
(2013).  A defendant moving for summary judgment "may satisfy his or her initial burden of production by either (1) presenting evidence negating an element of the [nonmovant's] claim, or 
(2) demonstrating that the nonmovant will be unable to carry his 
or her burden of proof at trial."  129 Hawai‘ i at 60, 292 P.3d at 
1290.  In other words, the movant's "burden may be discharged by 
demonstrating that if the case went to trial, there would be no 
competent evidence to support a judgment for his or her 
opponent."  Kondaur Cap. Corp. v. Matsuyoshi, 136 
Hawai‘i 227, 
240, 361 P.3d 454, 467 (2015) (cleaned up).    
"Only with the satisfaction of this initial showing 
does the burden shift to the [non-moving] party to respond by 
affidavits or as otherwise provided in [Hawai‘ i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (
HRCP)] Rule 56, setting forth specific facts showing 
that there is a genuine issue for trial."  136 Hawai‘ i at 240-41, 
361 P.3d at 467-68 (cleaned up). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 
9 
 Evidence will be examined in the light most favorable 
to the non-moving party.  See Nuuanu Valley Ass'n, 119 Hawai‘ i at 
96, 194 P.3d at 537.  "[S]ummary judgment should not be granted 
unless the entire record shows a right to judgment with such 
clarity as to leave no room for controversy and establishes 
affirmatively that the adverse party cannot prevail under any 
circumstances."  Goran Pleho, LLC v. Lacy, 144 Hawai‘ i 224, 236, 
439 P.3d 176, 188 (2019) (citation omitted). 
A. The Circuit Court Did Not Err In Granting Summary Judgment 
On Count 4  
 
 Starting with Count 4 (Fraud on the Court) of the 
complaint, the Saplans would have been required to establish by 
"clear and convincing evidence" that U.S. Bank "acted with the 
intent to defraud" the court, and the court was actually 
"deceived by the fraud."  See Schefke v. Reliable Collection 
Agency, Ltd., 96  408, 431, 32 P.3d 52, 75 (2001); 47 Am. Hawai‘i
Jur. 2d Judgments § 665 (2023); see also 47 Am. Jur. 2d 
Judgments § 691 (2023) ("nondisclosures which are not part of a 
deliberate scheme of misrepresentations fall short of the 
standard needed to set aside a judgment for fraud upon the 
court").  Under Hawai‘ i case law, to rise to the level of fraud 
on the court, the purported fraud "must be a direct assault on 
the integrity of the judicial process," which requires "more 
than nondisclosure by a party or the party's attorney to find NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 
10 
 fraud on the court."  Schefke, 96 Hawai‘ i at 431, 32 P.3d at 75 
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
In its motion for summary judgment, U.S. Bank argued 
that "there [was] nothing to indicate that the outcome of the 
2011 Action was purposefully hidden from the Court.  The 2011 
Action is a matter of public record and nothing suggests that 
[it] was required to disclose the prior action."  U.S. Bank 
additionally points out that the "Saplans knew about the 2011 
Action yet failed to raise it." 
To support its contention that the 2011 Action was a 
matter of public record, U.S. Bank attached various documents from the 2011 Action, including the Case Information sheet from 
"http://hoohiki.courts.hawaii.gov" and three documents file 
stamped by the clerk of the third circuit court - the order 
denying the Saplans' motion to dismiss, U.S. Bank's pretrial 
statement, and the order of dismissal. 
As the burden then shifted to the Saplans, they 
asserted that U.S. Bank "was absolutely precluded from filing its second action in 2014, which was nothing short of a 
fraudulent effort to remove Plaintiffs from their property, 
. . . amounting to an adjudication on the merits in favor of 
Plaintiffs herein."  The Saplans provided no affidavits or 
evidence to support their assertion. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 
11 
 The party asserting claim preclusion must prove that 
"(1) there was a final judgment on the merits, (2) both parties 
are the same or in privity with the parties in the original 
suit, and (3) the claim decided in the original suit is 
identical with the one presented in the action in question."  
Bremer v. Weeks, 104 Hawai‘ i 43, 54, 85 P.3d 150, 161 (2004). 
In both the 2011 Action and the 2014 Action, U.S. Bank 
asserted "ejectment."  And, although there was no final 
judgment, the dismissal of the 2011 Action was an adjudication on the merits in favor of the Saplans and against U.S. Bank.   
RCCH Rule 12(q) (providing in part that "[a]n action may be 
dismissed sua sponte with written notice to the parties . . . if 
a trial setting status conference has not been scheduled as 
required by Rule 12(c)"); Ryan v. Palmer, 130 Hawai‘ i 321, 322, 
310 P.3d 1022, 1023 (App. 2013) (amended on reconsideration in 
part by Ryan v. Palmer, 130 Hawai‘ i 301, 309 P.3d 969, No. CAAP-
12-0000697 (App. Sept. 12, 2013)) (explaining that because the 
circuit court's order of dismissal based on RCCH 12(q) "did not 
specify otherwise, the circuit court's dismissal was with 
prejudice[,]" citing HRCP Rule 41(b)(3)) (providing that 
"[u]nless the court in its order for dismissal otherwise 
specifies, a dismissal under this subdivision and any dismissal not provided for in this rule . . . operates as an adjudication 
upon the merits"). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 
12 
 But, as the party asserting preclusion, the Saplans 
failed to show that the parties in the 2014 Action were the same 
as the parties in the 2011 Action.  After the Saplans were 
dismissed from the 2014 Action, the Judgment of Possession and 
Writ of Judgment affected only Ricky and Ortiz, neither of whom 
were parties to the 2011 Action. 
In short, U.S. Bank's 2014 Action against Ricky and 
Ortiz, when considered in light of its 2011 Action against the Saplans, did not amount to fraud on the court.  Thus, we cannot 
say that the circuit court erred in granting U.S. Bank's motion 
for summary judgment on Count 4.  Ralston, 129 Hawai‘ i at 60, 292 
P.3d at 1290 ("For if no evidence could be mustered to sustain 
the [non-moving] party's position, a trial would be useless"). B. The Circuit Court Erred In Granting Summary Judgment On The 
Remaining Counts 
 
1. U.S. Bank failed to establish that the Saplans were 
precluded from asserting Counts 1-3 
 
On appeal, the Saplans argue that they were not 
precluded from filing the 2015 action as they were not parties 
to the 2014 Action and were not in privity with Ricky and Ortiz.  
To the contrary, U.S. Bank proffers that all three requirements 
of claim preclusion were satisfied. 
As the party asserting preclusion, U.S. Bank bore the 
burden of establishing that there was a final judgment on the 
merits, the parties are the same or in privity with those from NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 
13 
 the original action, and the claims are identical.  Bremer, 104 
 Hawai‘i at 54, 85 P.3d at 161.
Here, both the 2014 Action and this case involved an 
ejectment claim.  But, although there was a final judgment in 
the 2014 Action, there was no final judgment against the 
Saplans.  In other words, U.S. Bank failed to establish that the 
parties in both actions were the same.  U.S. Bank dismissed the 
Saplans from the 2014 Action and proceeded only against Ricky 
and Ortiz.  Thus, the parties were not the same in both cases.       
U.S. Bank then argues that the Saplans were in privity 
with Ricky "because as co-owners and co-mortgagors of the Property, their rights, duties, and obligations under the 
Mortgage were identical."  The concept of privity has evolved 
from the "narrowly defined meaning of 'mutual or successive 
relationship[s] to the same rights of property' to 'merely a 
word used to say that the relationship between the one who is a party of record and another is close enough to include that 
other within the res adjudicata.'"  In re Herbert M. Dowsett 
Tr., 7 Haw. App. 640, 646, 791 P.2d 398, 402 (1990) (citation 
omitted).  This concept of privity follows modern case law, 
which recognizes the determination of sufficient privity 
requires "careful examination into the circumstances in each 
case as it arises."  Id. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 
14 
   As "res judicata is an affirmative defense under HRCP 
Rule 8(c), the party asserting [it] has the burden of proving 
adequate representation of the interests and proper protection 
of the rights of the nonparty in the prior action."  7 Haw. App. 
at 646, 791 P.2d at 402-03.  "Adequate representation of the 
interests of the nonparty," as well as "proper protection to the rights of the person sought to be bound are major considerations 
in privity analysis."  7 Haw. App. at 646, 791 P.2d at 402 
(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  Further, the 
existence of privity "depend[s] upon a finding that the first 
action provided substantial protection of the rights and 
interests of the [nonparty]."  Id.   
Generally, there is no privity between joint tenants 
or tenants in common because they do not claim through or under each other, thus judgment for or against one regarding the land 
will not bind the others.  Hewahewa v. Lalakea, 27 Haw. 544, 571 
(Haw. Terr. 1923) (explaining that "there is no privity of estate between tenants in common"); 50 C.J.S. Judgments § 1112 
(2023) ("Joint tenants or tenants in common do not claim through or under each other, and therefore there is no such privity 
between them that a judgment for or against one of them 
affecting the land will bind the other"). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 
15 
 Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to 
the Saplans, U.S. Bank failed to meet its burden of establishing 
that the parties bound by the judgment in the 2014 Action (Ricky 
and Ortiz) were the same or in privity with the parties in this 
case (the Saplans). 
2. U.S. Bank failed to establish that the Saplans' claims 
were precluded under the doctrine of laches 
 
The Saplans argue their claims are not precluded under 
the doctrine of laches because they filed "this lawsuit within 
months of U.S. Bank's wrongful sale of their home to a third party, and within less than one year after U.S. Bank wrongfully 
obtained a judgment in" the 2014 case. 
"[L]aches is a defense in all civil actions."  Ass'n 
of Apartment Owners of Royal Aloha v. Certified Mgmt., Inc., 139 
Hawai‘i 229, 235, 386 P.3d 866, 872 (2016).  
There are two components to laches, both of which must 
exist before the doctrine will apply.  First, there must 
have been a delay by the plaintiff in bringing his claim, 
and that delay must have been unreasonable under the 
circumstances.  Delay is reasonable if the claim was 
brought without undue delay after plaintiff knew of the wrong or knew of facts and circumstances sufficient to impute such knowledge to him.  Second, that delay must have 
resulted in prejudice to defendant.  Common but by no means 
exclusive examples of such prejudice are loss of evidence 
with which to contest plaintiff's claims, including the 
fading memories or deaths or material witnesses, changes in the value of the subject matter, changes in defendant's 
position, and intervening rights of third parties. 
 
139  at 234, 386 P.3d at 871.  Additionally, "[l]apse of 
time alone does not constitute laches.  Since laches is an 
equitable defense, its application is controlled by equitable Hawai‘iNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 
16 
 considerations."  Pelosi v. Wailea Ranch Ests., 91 Hawai‘ i 478,
491, 985 P.2d 1045, 1058 (1999) (citation omitted) (holding 
delay of four months from learning of definitive plans not 
unreasonable).  
"[A] suit by a tenant in common to recover his or her 
share of the common property from a third person is not barred 
by laches, if it is brought within a reasonable time after the 
tenant ascertains that the third person is claiming the whole 
common property."  86 C.J.S. Tenancy in Common § 166 (2023). 
As the movant for summary judgment, it was U.S. Bank's 
burden to prove the delay was unreasonable.  See generally, 
Ralston, 129 Hawai‘ i at 59-61, 292 P.3d at 1289-91.  Based on the 
attachments to its motion for summary judgment, U.S. Bank held 
title to the property for several months before the Saplans 
challenged the ejectment during the 2011 Action, and that action 
was dismissed in 2013 for U.S. Bank's failure to prosecute.   
Later, U.S. Bank voluntarily dismissed the Saplans from the 2014 
Action.  About 14 months after being dismissed from the 2014 
case, the Saplans instituted the current case and took an active role in it. 
In sum, the Saplans defended themselves in the 2011 
Action, an action U.S. Bank failed to prosecute, and filed the 
2015 Complaint about fourteen months after U.S. Bank dismissed 
them from the 2014 Action.  Viewing this evidence in the light NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 
17 
 most favorable to the Saplans, we cannot say that U.S. Bank met 
its burden of establishing that the Saplans' delay in filing the 
complaint was unreasonable. 
3. U.S. Bank failed to establish that there was no 
genuine issue of material fact 
 
The Saplans argue that "because title to the subject 
real property was at issue in the 2011 lawsuit, which was 
adjudicated in [their] favor as the result of the court's 
dismissal, [they] maintain a superior claim to title." 
U.S. Bank, on the other hand, argues that "[t]he 2011 
Action did not determine title to the Property." (Formatting altered.)  Quoting from Kondaur, U.S. Bank explains that "[i]n 
order to prevail in an ejectment action, a plaintiff 'must necessarily prove that he or she owns the parcel in issue.'"  
136 Hawai‘ i at 241, 361 P.3d at 468 (citation omitted).  U.S. 
Bank then asserts that the Saplans' "claims fail as a matter of 
law because they cannot establish title to the Property[,]" and 
that "[a]s a result of the March 10, 2011 foreclosure sale, [the 
Saplans] were no longer the owners of the Property."  (Some 
formatting altered.) 
Counts 1 (Quiet Title), 2 (Ejectment), and 
3 (Trespass) of the Saplans' complaint requires the Saplans toprove they are the rightful owners of the Property.  See

and brackets omitted); Mew Kung Tung v. Wong Ka Mau, 8 Haw. 557, 
559 (Haw. Prov. Gov. 1893) (noting if title is in issue in 
trespass action, plaintiff bears burden to prove title).  
As the defendant moving for summary judgment, U.S. 
Bank "may satisfy [its] initial burden of production by either (1) presenting evidence negating an element of the [nonmovant's] 
claim, or (2) demonstrating that the nonmovant will be unable to 
carry his or her burden of proof at trial."  Ralston, 129 Hawai‘ i 
at 60, 292 P.3d at 1290 (citations omitted).  In other words, 
the movant's "burden may be discharged by demonstrating that if 
the case went to trial, there would be no competent evidence to 
support a judgment for his or her opponent."  Kondaur Cap. 
Corp., 136 Hawai‘ i at 240, 361 P.3d at 467 (cleaned up). 
Here, U.S. Bank presented the circuit court with a 
"Mortgagee's Quitclaim Deed Pursuant to Power of Sale" recorded
in the Bureau of Conveyances on July 22, 2011, conveying the 
Property to U.S. Bank.  However, a "quitclaim deed carries withit all of the infirmities that the prior non-judicial  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 foreclosure might have occasioned upon the deed."  136 Hawai‘ i at
241, 361 P.3d at 468.  A Mortgagee's "self-dealing of the 
Property trigger[s] its burden to prove in the summary judgment 
proceeding that the foreclosure 'sale was regularly and fairly 
conducted in every particular.'"  Id. (citation omitted).  Such 
"a self-dealing mortgagee . . . was required under Ulrich to 
introduce evidence that [it] exercised its right to non-judicial
foreclosure under a power of sale in a manner that was fair, 
reasonably diligent, and in good faith, and to demonstrate that 
an adequate price was procured for the Property."  136 
Hawai‘i at
242, 361 P.3d at 469.  
 
 
In moving for summary judgment, U.S. Bank also 
provided the circuit court with the Declaration of Sarah T. 
Greggerson (Greggerson
) of PNC, the loan servicing agent for 
U.S. Bank, who attested that the subject property was sold at public auction to U.S. Bank on March 10, 2011, and provided a 
certified copy of the "Mortgagee's Quitclaim Deed Pursuant to 
Power of Sale," recorded in the Bureau of Conveyances on 
July 22, 2011, showing U.S. Bank had held title to the Property.   Greggerson further attested that the property was sold to a 
third party on March 30, 2015. 
Although Greggerson attested that "[t]he Property was
sold at public auction on March 10, 2011 to U.S. Bank, the 
highest bidder[,]" her declaration "fails to provide any  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 
20 
   averments as to the fairness and regularity of the foreclosure 
sale or as to whether [U.S. Bank] conducted the foreclosure sale
in a diligent and reasonable manner."  Kondaur Cap. Corp., 136 
Hawai‘i at 242, 361 P.3d at 469.  Also, U.S. Bank's pre-trial 
statement in the 2011 action states the Property was sold for 
$288,000 at the foreclosure sale, but U.S. Bank "does not make 
any declaration concerning the adequacy of this price."  136 
Hawai
‘i at 243, 361 P.3d at 470.  
Thus, viewing the evidence presented in the light most 
favorable to the Saplans, U.S. Bank failed to meet its burden at 
summary judgment to show there was no genuine issue as to title 
of the Property.  By failing to establish as such, the burden never shifted to the Saplans. 
  The circuit court thus erred in granting U.S. Bank's 
motion for summary judgment on Counts 1-3.  To the extent the 
damages sought in Counts 5 (Unjust Enrichment/Actual Damages) 
and 6 (Punitive Damages) are related to Counts 1-3, the circuit 
court erred in granting summary judgment on those counts as 
well. 
IV. Conclusion 
  For the above reasons, we affirm in part and vacate in part the circuit court's October 23, 2017 order granting summary NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 judgment and October 23, 2017 Judgment, and remand this case for 
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
