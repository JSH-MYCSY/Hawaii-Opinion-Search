SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: 
Ginoza, Chief Judge, Reifurth and Chan, JJ.) 
This appeal arises out of a foreclosure action 
initiated by Plaintiff-Appellee Bank of New York Mellon FKA The 
Bank of New York, as Successor Trustee to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Trustee for the Holders of SAMI II Trust 2006-AR6, Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2006-AR6 (BONYM) to 
foreclose on certain real property owned by Defendants-Appellants   NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
James W. West and Jo Nyla West (the Wests). The Wests appeal 
from the Judgment filed on October 26, 2017, which was entered 
pursuant to the "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment for Foreclosure Against all Defendants and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure" (Order Granting Summary Judgment), also filed 
October 26, 2017, in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit 
(circuit court).
1 
On appeal, the Wests contend that the circuit court 
erred in granting summary judgment because it erroneously relied on the inadmissible hearsay testimony of Mary E. Schrumpf (Schrumpf) contained in two declarations in support of BONYM's 
motion for summary judgment and for interlocutory decree of 
foreclosure (Motion for Summary Judgment) in determining that 
BONYM had standing to prosecute the instant foreclosure action. 
Upon careful review of the record and briefs submitted 
by the parties and having given due consideration to the 
arguments and issues they raise, as well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve the Wests' point of error as follows, and we vacate and remand. 
The Hawai# i Supreme Court's decisions in Bank of 
America, N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai# i 361, 390 P.3d 1248 
(2017), U.S. Bank, N.A. v. Mattos, 140 Hawai# i 26, 398 P.3d 615 
(2017) and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Behrendt, 142 Hawai# i 37, 
414 P.3d 89 (2018) are dispositive in this case. In Reyes-Toledo, the supreme court held that in order to establish a right to foreclose in a judicial foreclosure action, the foreclosing plaintiff must establish standing, or entitlement to enforce the subject note, at the time the action was commenced. 139 Hawai# i 
at 367-70, 390 P.3d at 1254-57. 
As noted in Reyes-Toledo, a foreclosing plaintiff must 
typically "prove the existence of an agreement, the terms of the 
1 The Honorable Harry P. Freitas presided over proceedings relevant to
this appeal. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
agreement, a default by the mortgagor under the terms of the 
agreement, and giving of the cancellation notice." Id. at 367, 
390 P.3d at 1254 (citing Bank of Honolulu, N.A. v. Anderson, 3 Haw. App. 545, 551, 654 P.2d 1370, 1375 (1982)). A foreclosing plaintiff also carries the burden to prove entitlement to enforce the note and mortgage, which as articulated by the supreme court, "overlaps with the requirements of standing in foreclosure actions as 'standing is concerned with whether the parties have the right to bring suit.'" Id. (brackets omitted)(quoting Mottl v. Miyahira, 95 Hawai# i 381, 388, 23 P.3d 716, 723 (2001)). 
Because "standing relates to the invocation of the court's jurisdiction, it is not surprising that standing must be present at the commencement of the case." Id. at 368, 390 P.3d at 1255. 
Accordingly, a foreclosing plaintiff must establish entitlement to enforce the note and standing to foreclose on the mortgaged property at the commencement of the suit. Id. 
In the instant case BONYM was granted a decree of 
foreclosure via summary judgment ruling entered on October 26, 2017. BONYM filed its "Complaint for Mortgage Foreclosure" (Complaint) on June 21, 2012, alleging that "[p]laintiff 
qualifies as the Note holder with standing to prosecute the 
instant action as the Note is endorsed in blank, thereby converting the Note to a bearer instrument, and because Plaintiff is currently in rightful possession of the endorsed Note." Attached to the Complaint was, inter alia, a copy of the Adjustable Rate Note (Note). The Note indicates a promise to 
repay the lender and that the lender was Premium Capital Funding 
LLC D/B/A Topdot Mortgage, a New York Limited Liability Company (Premium Capital Funding).  Also attached to the Complaint was a 
single page "Allonge to Note" (Allonge), which is specially 
endorsed by Premium Capital Funding to Countrywide Bank, N.A., 
and which also contains: a special indorsement stamp from Countrywide Bank, N.A. to Countrywide Home Loans, Inc.; and a second stamp with an indorsement in blank by Countrywide Home Loans, Inc.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Below and on appeal, BONYM has maintained that it was 
the holder of the blank-indorsed Note and Allonge at the time it 
filed the Complaint. In support of this contention, BONYM relies on the copy of the Note and Allonge attached to the Complaint, a "Declaration of Custodian of Records for TMLF Hawaii, LLLC" executed on August 3, 2017, and a "Supplemental Declaration of Custodian of Records for TMLF Hawaii, LLLC", executed on September 7, 2017, both signed by Schrumpf as custodian of records for TMLF Hawaii LLLC (TMLF). TMLF is BONYM's foreclosing 
counsel, and per the Schrumpf declarations, TMLF was authorized 
"to be in physical possession of the original Note on behalf of [BONYM] during the duration of this litigation." Attached to the supplemental declaration executed on September 7, 2017 as Exhibit "10" is a copy of the Note and the attached Allonge. 
The Schrumpf declarations assert that "[i]t is part of 
TMLF Hawaii, LLLC's business practice to keep the original promissory notes on behalf of clients before filing of a Complaint, if the Complaint was filed by TMLF Hawaii LLLC." Schrumpf further attests that "[a]ccording to the records and 
files of TMLF Hawaii LLLC, on 05/10/2012, TMLF Hawaii LLLC was in 
possession of the original Adjustable Rate Note ("Note") dated 05/24/2006[,]" which "includes an 'Allonge to Note'." Thus, Schrumpf attests that BONYM was in possession of the Note and Allonge at the time the Complaint was filed. 
However, under Mattos, 140 Hawai# i 26, 398 P.3d 615 and 
Behrendt, 142 Hawai# i 37, 414 P.3d 89, Schrumpf's declarations 
fail to satisfy the requirements for admitting the Note and Allonge under the Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 803(b)(6)

Rule 803 Hearsay exceptions; availability of declarant
immaterial. The following are not excluded by the hearsay
rule, even though the declarant is available as a witness: 
. . . 
(b) Other exceptions.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
business records exception. As discussed in Behrendt: 
[t]he court in Mattos held that a witness may be qualified
to provide the testimony required by HRE Rule 803(b)(6) evenif the witness is not employed by the business that createdthe document or lacks direct, personal knowledge of how thedocument was created. Id. "There is no requirement that therecords have been prepared by the entity that has custody ofthem, as long as they were created in the regular course ofsome entity's business." Id. (quoting State v. Fitzwater,122 Hawai‘i 354, 366, 227 P.3d 520, 532 (2010)). Thewitness, however, must have enough familiarity with therecord-keeping system of the business that created therecord to explain how the record was generated in theordinary course of business. Id. 
Records received from another business and incorporated into
the receiving business' records may in some circumstances beregarded as "created" by the receiving business. Id.Incorporated records are admissible under HRE Rule 803(b)(6)when a custodian or qualified witness testifies that thedocuments were incorporated and kept in the normal course ofbusiness, that the incorporating business typically reliesupon the accuracy of the contents of the documents, and thecircumstances otherwise indicate the trustworthiness of the document. See id.; Fitzwater, 122 Hawai‘i at 367-68, 227P.3d at 533-34. 
142 Hawai# i at 45-46, 414 P.3d at 97-98 (emphasis added). The 
Schrumpf declaration executed on September 7, 2017, states in 
pertinent part: 
1. I am one of the custodian of records for TMLF Hawaii,
LLLC and I am qualified to testify on the matters as stated
below 
2. I make this Declaration based on my personal knowledgeand I am competent to testify about the matters stated inthis Declaration. 
3. I have personal knowledge of the record keeping process
of TMLF Hawaii, LLLC, which the normal business practices ofmy office include, but are not limited to, the entries in 
2(...continued) 
. . . 
(6) Records of regularly conducted activity. Amemorandum, report, record, or data compilation,in any form, of acts, events, conditions,opinions, or diagnoses, made in the course of aregularly conducted activity, at or near the timeof the acts, events, conditions, opinions, or diagnoses, as shown by the testimony of the custodian or other qualified witness, or bycertification that complies with rule 902(11) ora statute permitting certification, unless thesources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness.

the business records are made at or near the time of the 
occurrence by the person with actual knowledge of theoccurrence being recorded in the business record. 
4. It is part of TMLF Hawaii, LLLC's business practice to
keep the original promissory notes on behalf of clientsbefore filing of a Complaint, if the Complaint was filed byTMLF Hawaii LLLC. 
5. According to the records and files of TMLF Hawaii LLLC,
on 05/10/2012, TMLF Hawaii LLLC was in possession of the
original Adjustable Rate Note ("Note") dated 05/24/2006. The original Note is currently stored at TMLF Hawaii, LLLC'sdesignated storage facility in a fire-proof safe. The scanned copy of the original Note is exactly the same copyof the original Note attached hereto as Exhibit "1" [sic],save for the redaction of personal information. 
The 
original Note that is kept in my business records includesan "Allonge to Note" as provided for in Exhibit "1" [sic]. 
6. Attached hereto as Exhibit "10" is a true and correct 
copy of the original Note and the attached Allonge to Note(with all personal information redacted) that was scannedinto my business records, and is kept in the regularordinary course of business, and was created by someone withpersonal knowledge of its creation. Based on the records and files of TMLF Hawaii, LLLC
, I have confirmed that the
attached Exhibit "10" was scanned into my business recordson 05/10/2012. 
7. According to my records and files, Plaintiff has
authorized TMLF Hawaii LLLC to be in physical possession ofthe original Note during the duration of this litigation. 
(Emphasis added). 
Schrumpf does not assert in either declaration that she 
is familiar with the record-keeping system of the businesses that 
created the Note and Allonge, so that she can explain how the Note and Allonge were generated in the ordinary course of business. See Behrendt, 142 Hawai# i
  at 45, 414 P.3d at 97. 
Alternatively, Schrumpf fails to attest that TMLF typically relies on the accuracy of the contents of the documents, and circumstances that otherwise indicate trustworthiness of the documents. Id. Accordingly, because Schrumpf's declarations do 
not lay adequate foundation as to the Note and Allonge, the documents are not admissible to establish BONYM's standing to enforce the Note and Allonge at the commencement of the action. See Behrendt, 142 Hawai# i at 45-46, 414, P.3d at 97-98; Mattos, 
140 Hawai# i at 33, 398 P.3d at 622; Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai# i at 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
370-71, 390 P.3d at 1257-58. 
In sum, the record lacks admissible evidence that 
establishes BONYM's entitlement to enforce the Note and Allonge 
when this action was commenced. 
Viewing the evidence in the 
light most favorable to the Wests, as we must for purposes of a summary judgment ruling, we conclude that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether BONYM had standing to prosecute this foreclosure action when it was commenced. Accordingly, pursuant to Reyes-Toledo, Behrendt, and Mattos, the circuit court erred in granting BONYM's motion for summary judgment. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Circuit Court 
of the Third Circuit's "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment for Foreclosure Against all Defendants and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure", and Judgment, both entered on October 26, 2017, are vacated. 
This case is remanded to the circuit court for 
further proceedings.
