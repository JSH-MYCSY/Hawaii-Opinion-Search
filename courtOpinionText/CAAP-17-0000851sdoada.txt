IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
GARY RESPICIO, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
ADMINISTRATIVE DIRECTOR OF THE COURTS,
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Respondent-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
HONOLULU DIVISION 
(1DAA-17-00005) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Chan, JJ.) 
Petitioner-Appellant Gary Respicio (Respicio) appeals 
from the Judgment on Appeal, entered on November 1, 2017, in the 
District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division (District 
Court).1  The District Court affirmed the Administrative Driver's 
License Revocation Office's (ADLRO) decision to revoke Respicio's driver's license for one year. 
In this secondary appeal, Respicio contends the 
District Court erred by affirming the ADLRO's decision by 
misapplying State v. Heapy, 113 Hawai# i 283, 151 P.3d 764 (2007), 
because there was no legal way to avoid a roadblock without

violating a traffic law and there was no reasonable and 
articulable basis to stop him. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we 
resolve Respicio's points of error as follows: 
Respicio argues  that "the hearing officer and the 
District Court did not fully and correctly apply Heapy" and 
points to a number of facts related to what appears to be his 
basic contention that, "[a]s there was no legal way to avoid it, 
the roadblock coerced motorists into the roadblock contrary to 
Heapy."  Respicio does not cite to, nor do we find, language in 
either the plurality's opinion or the concurring opinion in Heapy 
that holds the police must provide motorists with a legal method 
for avoiding a roadblock.  Rather, the proposition upon which a 
majority of the justices agreed was that the police had no 
reasonable suspicion of criminal activity to justify stopping 
Heapy when he legally avoided the roadblock.  2
Respicio does not challenge the hearing officer's 
finding that he was observed failing to use a turn signal and 
crossing a solid white line when pulling off the road prior to 
encountering the roadblock.  See Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 291C-
84 (2007) (Turning movements and required signals) and ยง 291C-38 
(2007) Longitudinal traffic lane markings).  Therefore, the 
District Court's conclusion that Respicio committed multiple 
traffic infractions supporting reasonable suspicion for the stop 
2 We note that Respicio's points on appeal are in violation of 
Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(4) in that they do not include
record citations for where the alleged errors occurred, or where the alleged
errors were brought to the attention of the District Court.  Respicio alsofails to quote the findings or conclusions of the court urged as error.  Id. Counsel is warned that future violations of court rules may result insanctions.

and its decision to affirm the ADLRO Director's decision was not 
error. 
THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment on Appeal, 
entered on November 1, 2017, in the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division, is affirmed.
