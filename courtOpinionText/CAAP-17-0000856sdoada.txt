APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 15-1-0079) 
  
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By:  Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.)
 
 
   Self-represented Plaintiff-Appellant Edward K.

Fifth Circuit 's (1) November 7, 2017 Order of Dismissal Pursuant 
to Rule 28 of the Rules of the Circuit Courts of the State of

 Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve this 
appeal as follows and affirm. 
In the Order of Dismissal, the circuit court dismissed 
Nakaula's June 5, 2015 Complaint (Complaint) for want of 
service.  Specifically, Nakaula did not serve the Complaint on 
Defendant-Appellee Neal Wagatsuma, Warden, Kaua‘i Community 
Correctional Center, State of Hawai‘i (Wagatsuma), pursuant to 
the Rules of the Circuit Courts of the State of Hawai‘ i (RCCH) 
Rule 28. 
RCCH Rule 28 provides as follows: 
A diligent effort to effect service shall be made in all 
actions.  An action or claim may be dismissed sua sponte 
with written notice to the parties if no service is made 
within 6 months after the action or claim has been filed. 
Such dismissal may be set aside and the action or claim 
reinstated by order of the court for good cause shown upon 
motion duly filed not later than ten (10) days from the 
date of the order of dismissal. 
 
Nothing in the record demonstrates that the circuit court 
improperly entered the Order of Dismissal.   
Moreover, the Order of Dismissal explicitly stated, 
"[t]his dismissal may be set aside and the pleading or claim may 
be reinstated by order of the court for good cause shown upon 
motion duly filed not later than ten (10) days from the date of 
this order of dismissal."  Nakaula did not file a motion to set 
aside the dismissal to have his pleading reinstated. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 Having raised no other discernable arguments on appeal 
relevant to the order and judgment, Nakaula presents no basis 
for this court to hold that the circuit court erred in 
dismissing his Complaint.      2
For these reasons, we affirm the circuit court's 
(1)  November 7, 2017 Order of Dismissal Pursuant to Rule 28 of 
the Rules of the Circuit Courts of the State of Hawai‘i and 
(2) April 18, 2018 Judgment of Dismissal as to All Claims and 
All Parties. 
  DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai‘ i, August 24, 2022.

2  Nakaula' s opening brief does not meet the requirements of Hawai ‘i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure ( HRAP) Rule 28(b).  Pursuant to HRAP Rule 1(d), 
"[a]ttorneys and pro se parties are deemed to be aware of, and are expected 
to comply with, all of the provisions of these rules."   However, we address 
Nakaula' s arguments as related to the order and judgment from which he 
appeals " to the extent they can reasonably be discerned" to promote equal 
access to justice for pro se litigants.  Wagner v. World Botanical Gardens, 
Inc., 126 Hawai ‘i 190, 193, 268 P.3d 443, 446 (App. 2011).
