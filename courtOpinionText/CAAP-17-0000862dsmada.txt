APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
NORTH AND SOUTH KONA DIVISION
(CASE NO. 3DTA-17-01026)
ORDER
CONSOLIDATING CASE NUMBERS CAAP-17-0000862 AND
CAAP-17-0000890 UNDER CASE NUMBER CAAP-17-0000862
AND 
DISMISSING CONSOLIDATED APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
Upon review of the record of district court criminal
case number 3DTA-17-01026 for resulting appeals in appellate
court case numbers CAAP-17-0000862 and CAAP-17-0000890, it
appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction pursuant to Hawaii
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-12(a) (2016).  
In CAAP-17-0000862, Defendant-Appellant Alfred
Napahueluna Spinney (Spinney),  pro se, appeals from (1) the May
22, 2017 Bench Warrant issued in 3DTA-17-01026 by the Honorable
Margaret K. Masunaga, (2) the December 4, 2017 Order and NoticeNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
of Entry of Order entered in 3DTA-17-01026 by the Honorable Peter
Bresciani ordering Spinney to return to court for a further
hearing, and (3) December 4, 2017 Order and Notice of Entry of
Order entered in 3DTA-17-035841 by the Honorable Peter Bresciani
ordering Spinney to return to court on December 5, 2017 for
further arraignment and plea, all after Spinney's April 27, 2017
Notice of Appeal filed in 3DTC-17-01026.  
In CAAP-17-0000890, Spinney appeals from the Honorable
Margaret K. Masunaga's December 5, 2017 Order and Notice of Entry
of Order in 3DTA-17-01026, noting that Spinney asserted the
matter was on appeal and directing Spinney to return to district
court on May 14, 2018, regarding the status of Spinney's appeal.
Both appeals arise out of the same underlying
proceedings in district court criminal case number 3DTA-17-01026
involving five traffic offenses of which Spinney was convicted, a
judgment and sentence was entered and from which conviction,
judgment and sentence he previously appealed.  Under these
circumstances, consolidation and dismissal of these two appeals
is warranted.
 "A post-judgment order is appealable in its own right
. . . if it meets the test of finality applicable to all judicial
decisions."  State v. Johnson, 96 Hawai #i 462, 469, 32 P.3d 106,
113 (App. 2001) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
"A final order has been defined, albeit in the context of a civil
case, as an order ending the proceedings, leaving nothing further
to be accomplished."  Id. (citation and internal quotation marks
omitted).  Thus, the Hawai# i Intermediate Court of Appeals has
noted that a criminal "[d]efendant may . . . appeal from [an]
order that disposes of [a] . . . motion for revocation of
probation."  Id. at 471, 32 P.3d at 115; see also, e.g., State v.
Yamamoto, 79 Hawai #i 511, 514, 904 P2d 525, 528 (1995)
(addressing an appeal from (1) a post-judgment order revoking

prosecution for Contempt of Court for failure to appear in court on May 22,
2017 in Criminal Case number 3DTA-17-01026.

probation and re-sentencing a defendant and (2) an order denying
the defendant’s subsequent motion to correct the new sentence). 
However, the bench warrant and orders Spinney designates in his
notices of appeal, have not "end[ed] the proceedings, leaving
nothing further to be accomplished."  Absent such a final order,
that disposes of pending proceedings in district court criminal
case number 3DTA-17-01026, Spinney's appeal is premature and we
lack appellate jurisdiction to review the May 22, 2017,
December 4, 2017, and December 5, 2017 orders entered in that
criminal case.
In 3DTA-17-03584, no final judgment or order has been
entered.  The December 4, 2017 Order and Notice of Entry of Order 
ordering Spinney to return to court on December 5, 2017 for
further arraignment and plea designated in CAAP-17-0000862 is an
interlocutory order filed before a final judgment has been
entered.  HRS § 641-12(a) provides that "[a]ppeals upon the
record shall be allowed from all final decisions and final
judgments of district courts in all criminal matters." 
Consequently, "in order to appeal a criminal matter in the
district court, the appealing party must appeal from a written
judgment or order that has been filed with the clerk of the court
pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(b)(3)."  State v. Bohannon , 102 Hawai #i
228, 236, 74 P.3d 980, 988 (2003); see also Rule 32(c)(2) of the
Hawai#i Rules of Penal Procedure; State v. Kilborn , 109 Hawai #i
435, 442, 127 P.3d 95, 102 (App. 2005).  Therefore we lack
appellate jurisdiction to review this order as well.2
In light of our lack of appellate jurisdiction over
both appeals, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case
numbers CAAP-17-0000862 and CAAP-17-0000890 are consolidated
under appellate court case number CAAP-17-0000862.  The appellate

Shimizu Corp., 92 Hawai #i 243, 265, 990 P.2d 713, 735 (1999) (citations
omitted).  "The general rule, however, assumes that the notice of appeal is
valid under the applicable statutory provisions and procedural rules.  Where
the notice of appeal is jurisdictionally defective, filing the notice does not
transfer jurisdiction from the trial court to the appellate court."  State v.

IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that the consolidated
appeals in appellate court case number CAAP-17-0000862 are
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
