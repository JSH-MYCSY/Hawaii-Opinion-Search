APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 15-1-0237-02) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Reifurth and Chan, JJ.) 
In an appeal arising out of a judicial foreclosure, 
Defendants-Appellants Philip Detol and Roxanne Tom-Detol (the 
Detols) appeal from a "Judgment" (Judgment Confirming Sale) 
entered pursuant to an "Order Confirming Foreclosure Sale, 
Approving Commissioner's Report, Allowance of Commissioner's Fees, Attorneys' Fees, Costs, Directing Conveyance, and for Writ of Ejectment" (Order Confirming Sale), both filed November 13,  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2017, by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court).1 
The Judgment Confirming Sale was entered in favor of Plaintiff-
Appellee Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Trustee Under Pooling and Servicing Agreement Dated as of June 1, 2006 Securitized Asset Backed Receivables LLC Trust 2006-FR2 Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2006-FR2 (Wells Fargo Bank). 
On appeal, the Detols contend that: (1) the Circuit 
Court abused its discretion by entering the Judgment Confirming Sale because Wells Fargo Bank failed to allow the Detols the opportunity to cure their default and stop the foreclosure sale, and; (2) the Circuit Court abused its discretion by failing to engage the issue of whether Wells Fargo Bank had standing to foreclose on the subject mortgage. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve the Detols' points of error as follows and affirm. 
On February 11, 2015, Wells Fargo Bank filed a 
complaint for foreclosure against the Detols. On October 4, 2016, the Circuit Court granted Wells Fargo Bank's motion for summary judgment seeking a decree of foreclosure (Summary
Judgment/Foreclosure Decree) and also entered a Judgment on the 
decree of foreclosure (Foreclosure Judgment).
2 The Detols did 
not appeal from the Foreclosure Judgment. 
(1) As to the Detols' first contention, 
notwithstanding a right to cure a default discussed in Santiago 
v. Tanaka, 137 Hawai# i 137, 156, 366 P.3d 612, 631 (2016), the 
Detols did not cure by the day of the Order Confirming Sale.   As 
the Hawai
#i Supreme Court explained in Santiago, "it is typical 
in foreclosure cases that a right to cure a default and stop the

proceeding.

foreclosure continues up to the day of the confirmation of sale." 
Id. at 157, 366 P.3d at 632 (emphasis added) (citation omitted). 
The court in Santiago declared a foreclosure sale 
unlawful when the defaulting party had already cured their default prior to the foreclosure sale. Id. In the case at bar, however, the Detols did not cure their default by the day of the confirmation of sale.  Thus, the Circuit Court did not deny the 
Detols a right to cure by entering the Judgment Confirming Sale.  
See id.

(2) Regarding the Detols' second contention, they 
argue that Wells Fargo Bank lacked standing because Wells Fargo Bank failed to demonstrate that it was in possession of the original note and was entitled to enforce the note at the time the action was filed. However, the res judicata effect of the Foreclosure Judgment bars the Detols' request for relief in this appeal based on a challenge to Wells Fargo Bank's standing. See Mortg. Elec. Registration Sys., Inc. v. Wise, 130 Hawai# i 11, 304 
P.3d 1192 (2013). 
In Wise, the Hawai# i Supreme Court held that, in 
foreclosure cases, the doctrine of res judicata precludes foreclosure defendants from raising defenses at the confirmation of sale stage of the proceedings that could have been raised in challenging entry of a foreclosure judgment. Id. at 17-18, 304 P.3d at 1198-99. 
Because the defendants in Wise never challenged the 
foreclosure judgment, the foreclosure judgment became final and binding. Id. at 17, 304 P.3d at 1198. The defendants' failure 
3 During the hearing on Wells Fargo Bank’s "Motion [to Confirm
Foreclosure Sale]," the Detols admitted through counsel that they were not 
"ready, willing and able to bring the mortgage current, reimburse the lending
institution for its fees and costs right now". 
4   On appeal, the Detols argue that Wells Fargo Bank failed to comply
with the Real Estate Procedures Act (RESPA), 12 U.S.C. § 2601 et seq., and its
implementing regulation, Regulation X. The Detols did not, however, raisethis issue in the Circuit Court. "Legal issues not raised in the trial courtare ordinarily deemed waived on appeal."

to appeal from the foreclosure judgment precluded them from 
raising the issue of standing on appeal from the order confirming sale. Id. at 19, 304 P.3d at 1200. 
[T]he foreclosure judgment determined the merits of
the controversy, rendering subsequent proceedingsincident to its enforcement . . . [W]e conclude that
res judicata would preclude Petitioners from
challenging Respondent's standing in their appeal from
the order confirming sale, despite the generalproposition that a lack of standing may be raised at
any time. Under the doctrine of res judicata ,
challenges to Respondent’s standing were subsumed
under the foreclosure judgment, which had [become]final and binding. 
Id. at 17, 304 P.3d at 1198 (emphasis added) (citation omitted). 
Here, like in Wise, the Detols did not appeal from the 
Foreclosure Judgment. Hence, the Foreclosure Judgment became 
final and binding, and the Detols are barred from challenging Wells Fargo Bank's standing in this appeal. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Judgment" 
entered on November 13, 2017, by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit, is affirmed.
