CAAP-17-0000887
STATE OF HAWAI #I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
ALFRED N. SPINNEY, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
NORTH AND SOUTH KONA DIVISION
(CASE NOS. 3DCW-17-0000900 and 3CPC-17-0000245)
ORDER 
DISMISSING APPELLATE COURT CASE NUMBER
CAAP-17-0000887 FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
AND
DISMISSING AS MOOT ALL PENDING MOTIONS
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
Upon review of the record of district court criminal
case number 3DCW-17-0000900, district court criminal case number
3DCW-16-0001177, and circuit criminal court case number 3CPC-17-
0000245 and this appeal by Defendant-Appellant Alfred Napahueluna
Spinney (Spinney), pro se, in appellate court case number CAAP-
17-0000887, it appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction
pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-12(a) (2016) and
HRS § 641-11 (2016).  Spinney appears to be appealing from the
following four interlocutory orders from three separate
underlying case numbers:
(1) the Honorable Peter Bresciani's April 17, 2017
interlocutory order in district court criminal
case number 3DCW-16-0001177;1
1On May 6, 2016, Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai #i (the State)
filed a complaint against Spinney in district court criminal case number 3DCW-

(2) the Honorable Henry T. Nakamoto's May 16, 2017
bench warrant in district court criminal case
number 3DCW-17-0000900;2
(3) the Honorable Greg K. Nakamura's June 2, 2017
warrant of arrest in circuit court criminal case
number 3CPC-17-000245;3 and
(4) the Honorable Melvin H. Fujino's December 4, 2017
order pertaining to bail in circuit court criminal
case number 3CPC-17-000245.
"The right of appeal in a criminal case is purely statutory[.]" 
State v. Nicol, 140 Hawai# i 482, 485, 403 P.3d 259, 262 (2017)
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  The law that
allows appeals from district court criminal cases is HRS § 641-
12(a), which provides that "[a]ppeals upon the record shall be
allowed from all final decisions and final judgments of district
courts in all criminal matters."  The law that allows appeals
from circuit court criminal cases is HRS § 641-11, which provides
that "[a]ny party aggrieved by the judgment of a circuit court in
a criminal matter may appeal to the intermediate appellate court,
subject to chapter 602, in the manner and within the time
provided by the rules of court.  The sentence of the court in a
criminal case shall be the judgment."  Both statutes authorize an
appeal from a final judgment or final order that terminates the
criminal proceedings in the case and leaves nothing further to be
adjudicated by the trial court.  
State v. Kilborn , 109 Hawai #i
435, 442, 127 P.3d 95, 102 (App. 2005) (regarding appealability
in a district court criminal case pursuant to HRS § 641-12); 
Nicol, 140 Hawai #i at 492, 403 P.3d at 269 (regarding
appealability in a circuit court criminal case pursuant to HRS
1(...continued)
16-0001177 for (1) one count of harassment in violation of  HRS § 711-1106
(2014) and (2) one count of refusal or failure to provide a specimen for
forensic identification in violation of HRS § 844D-111 (Supp. 2017). 
2On April 4, 2017, the State filed a complaint against Spinney in
district court criminal case number 3DCW-17-0000900 charging Spinney with
criminal contempt of court in violation of HRS § 710-1077 (2014 & Supp. 2017).
3On April 17, 2017, the district court entered an order in district
court criminal case number 3DCW-16-0001177 committing the State's complaint to
the circuit court in circuit court criminal case number 3CPC-17-000245 for
further proceedings.
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
§ 641-11).  None of the four interlocutory orders that Spinney is
appealing is independently appealable, and, thus, all four
interlocutory orders are eligible for appellate review only by
way of a timely appeal from a final judgment or final order that
terminates that particular criminal case.  See, e.g., State v.
Adam, 97 Hawai #i 475, 482, 40 P.3d 877, 884 (2002) ("As a general
rule, an appeal from a final judgment in a case brings up for
review all preceding interlocutory orders in the case." 
(Citations omitted)).  Spinney filed his December 14, 2017 notice
of appeal before any trial court's announcement or entry of any
final decision in district court criminal case number 3DCW-17-
0000900, district court criminal case number 3DCW-16-0001177, and
circuit criminal court case number 3CPC-17-0000245, and, thus,
his appeal is premature under Rule 4(b) of the Hawai# i Rules of
Appellate Procedure and does not invoke our appellate
jurisdiction under HRS § 641-12 or HRS § 641-11.  We lack
appellate jurisdiction.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
case number CAAP-17-0000887 is dismissed for lack of appellate
jurisdiction.
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions
in appellate court case number CAAP-17-0000887 are dismissed as
moot.
