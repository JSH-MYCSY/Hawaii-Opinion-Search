APPEALS FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT

ORDER 
CONSOLIDATING CASE NUMBERS CAAP-17-0000888 AND
 
CAAP-18-0000402 UNDER CASE NUMBER CAAP-17-0000888, 
DISMISSING CONSOLIDATED APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
AND
 
DISMISSING AS MOOT ALL PENDING MOTIONS IN THE CONSOLIDATED APPEAL
 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Reifurth and Chan, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record of district court criminal
 
case number 3DCW-17-0003264 for resulting appeals in appellate
 
court case numbers CAAP-17-0000888 and CAAP-18-0000402, it 
NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction pursuant to Hawaii
 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-12(a) (2016). In these two appeals,
 Defendant-Appellant Alfred Napahueluna Spinney (Spinney), pro se,
 appeals from the Honorable Peter Bresciani's December 4, 2017
 interlocutory order, the Honorable Harry Freitas's February 14,
 2018 interlocutory order, and the Honorable M. Kanani Laubach's
 May 10, 2018 interlocutory order from the ongoing proceedings for
 Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawaii's (the State) December 4, 2017
 complaint against Spinney for criminal contempt of court in
 violation of HRS § 710-1077 (2014 & Supp. 2017). Under these
 circumstances, the consolidation and dismissal of the two appeals
 is warranted.
 
"The right of appeal in a criminal case is purely 
statutory[.]" State v. Nicol, 140 Hawai' i 482, 485, 403 P.3d 
259, 262 (2017) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The Hawai' i Intermediate Court of Appeals has jurisdiction "[t]o 
hear and determine appeals from any court or agency when appeals are allowed by law[.]" HRS § 602-57(1) (2016). HRS § 641-12(a) is the statute providing that "[a]ppeals upon the record shall be allowed from all final decisions and final judgments of district courts in all criminal matters." Consequently, "in order to appeal a criminal matter in the district court, the appealing party must appeal from a written judgment or order that has been filed with the clerk of the court pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(b)(3)." State v. Bohannon, 102 Hawai' i 228, 236, 74 P.3d 980, 988 (2003); 
see also Rule 32(c)(2) of the Hawai' i Rules of Penal Procedure; 
State v. Kilborn, 109 Hawai' i 435, 442, 127 P.3d 95, 102 (App. 
2005) (regarding the appealability of a district court judgment of conviction); State v. Hern, 133 Hawai' i 59, 62, 323 P.3d 1241, 
1244 (App. 2013) (regarding the appealability of a district court judgment dismissing the complaint without prejudice). 
In the instant two appeals, none of the appealed orders
 
are independently appealable under HRS § 641-12, and, thus, they
 are interlocutory orders that would be eligible for appellate
 review only by way of an appeal from an appealable final judgment

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
under the principle that, "[a]s a general rule, an appeal from a 
final judgment in a case brings up for review all preceding interlocutory orders in the case." State v. Adam, 97 Hawai' i 
475, 482, 40 P.3d 877, 884 (2002) (citations omitted). The district court has not yet entered a final judgment on the State's original December 4, 2017 complaint for criminal contempt of court in violation of HRS § 710-1077, and, thus, we lack appellate jurisdiction over both appeals.

Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
 
case numbers CAAP-17-0000888 and CAAP-18-0000402 are consolidated
 under appellate court case number CAAP-17-0000888. The appellate
 court clerk shall file a copy of this order in appellate court
 case numbers CAAP-17-0000888 and CAAP-18-0000402.
 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that the consolidated
 
appeals in appellate court case number CAAP-17-0000888 are
 dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions
 
in the consolidated appeals in appellate court case number CAAP­17-0000888 are dismissed as moot.

 "Generally, the filing of a notice of appeal divests the trial court
of jurisdiction over the appealed case." TSA International Limited v. Shimizu 
Corporation, 92 Hawai 'i 243, 265, 990 P.2d 713, 735 (1999) (citations
omitted). "The general rule, however, assumes that the notice of appeal is
valid under the applicable statutory provisions and procedural rules. Where 
the notice of appeal is jurisdictionally defective, filing the notice does nottransfer jurisdiction from the trial court to the appellate court." State v. 
Ontiveros, 82 Hawai 'i 446, 449, 923 P.2d 388, 391 (1996) (citations omitted;
