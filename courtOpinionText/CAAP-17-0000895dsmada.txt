APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.) 
Defendant/Counterclaimant-Appellant, Ronald G.S. Au 
(Au) appeals from the following four post-judgment orders entered 
by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court): 
1. the June 21, 2017 denial of "Ronald G.S. Au's Motion to Recuse or Disqualify Judge Rhonda A. Nishimura on the 
Basis of Conflict of Interest, Bias and Prejudice From 
Civil No. 13-1-0420-02 [RAN] and Civil No. 15-1-1452-07 
[RAN]" (Recusal Denial); 
2. the May 18, 2016 "Order Denying Without Prejudice Defendant/Counterclaimant's April 13, 2016 Request Re: 
Prefiling Order" (Order Denying Leave to Move to 
Vacate) denying permission to file a motion to vacate 
or set aside the June 12, 2015 Final Judgment on a 
theory that Judge Nishimura should recuse herself; NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
3. the July 1, 2016 "Order Denying Without Prejudice 
Defendant/Counterclaimant's June 22, 2016 Request to 
File Motion to Recuse or Disqualify Judge Rhonda A. 
Nishimura on the Basis of Conflict of Interest, Bias 
and Prejudice From Civil No. 13-1-0420-02 [RAN] and 
Civil No. 15-1-1452-078 [RAN]" (Order Denying Leave to 
Move to Disqualify); and 
4. the December 4, 2017 "First Amended Order Granting Mr. Au's Motion to Vacate and Set Aside Garnishee 
Orders, Summons and Attachments Filed on Garnishee 
Banks and Financial Institutions (Motion filed 
10/26/17)" (Order Vacating Garnishee Orders)
1. 
On appeal, Au contends that Judge Nishimura abused her 
discretion or committed willful misconduct in denying his 
requests to file and denying a filed motion to disqualify or to 
recuse herself. 
The parties agree that since the Order Denying Leave to 
Move to Vacate, the Order Denying Leave to Move to Disqualify, 
and the Recusal Denial, Judge Nishimura has retired and Judge 
Crabtree has been assigned to this case. Au recognizes that, in 
a related case, Au v. Kawika Burgess, Civil No. 15-1-1452-07, 
Judge Nishimura's denial of the motions to disqualify are moot as 
1 The Honorable Rhonda A. Nishimura entered the first three orders 
and the Honorable Jeffrey P. Crabtree entered the fourth. 
Au timely appealed from the December 4, 2017 Order Vacating
Garnishee Orders, the post-judgment order that finally determined, and thus
ended all of the existing post-judgment garnishment proceedings in this case.See Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 Hawai #i 153, 157-58, 80 P.3d 974, 978-79 (2003).
Plaintiff/Counterclaim Defendant-Appellee Trustees of the Estate of BernicePauahi Bishop, also known as Kamehameha Schools, argues that Au's appeal fromthe Order Denying Leave to Move to Vacate and the Order Denying Leave to Moveto Disqualify is untimely. However, where a party is appealing from a post-judgment order, "this court will . . . consider other orders which werepreliminary rulings upon which the subject Order was predicated or were partof the series of orders which collectively led to that Order." Cook v. Surety
Life Ins. Co., 79 Hawai #i 403, 409, 903 P.2d 708, 714 (App. 1995). 
It appears that Au appealed the Order Vacating Garnishee Orders
solely to obtain review of the other three orders. In any event, as Au doesnot argue why this order was entered in error, we decline to consider itfurther. See Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(7)
("Points not argued may be deemed waived."). 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to that case. Although not clear, Au appears to point to the 
continued vitality of an order entered by Judge Nishimura in the 
case from which this appeal is brought (Civil No. 13-1-0420-02), 
declaring Au a vexatious litigant (Vexatious Litigant Order), and 
claims it constitutes a "collateral consequence" which excepts 
this appeal from the mootness doctrine. 
A case is moot if it has lost its character as a present,
live controversy of the kind that must exist if courts areto avoid advisory opinions on abstract propositions of law.The rule is one of the prudential rules of judicialself-governance founded in concern about the proper--andproperly limited--role of the courts in a democraticsociety. We have said the suit must remain alive throughoutthe course of litigation to the moment of final appellatedisposition to escape the mootness bar. 
Simply put, a case is moot if the reviewing court can no
longer grant effective relief. 
Kaho# ohanohano v. State, 114 Hawai# i 302, 332, 162 P.3d 696, 726 
(2007) (citations, internal quotations marks, emphasis, brackets, 
and block format indenting omitted) (emphasis added). There are 
two conditions for justiciability: adverse interest and 
effective remedy. 
Lathrop v. Sakatani, 111 Hawai# i 307, 312-13, 
141 P.3d 480, 485-86 (2006) (quoting Wong v. Bd. of Regents, Univ. of Hawai# i, 62 Haw. 391, 394, 616 P.2d 201, 203-04 (1980)). 
In this case, regardless of the merits of Au's claim, 
we can offer no effective remedy. The circuit judge in this case 
has retired and the judge will not preside over any further 
proceedings in this case. 
Au states in his conclusion that we "should reverse and 
remand for trial by jury CAAP-15-0000466 and CAAP-16-0000235 
determining the Trial Judge abused her power and sustain Au's 
motion to recuse or disqualify Judge Nishimura." Both of these 
appeals--the first from the judgment
2 and the latter from the 
2 We note that the judgment was entered based on the grant of
summary judgment which this court reviewed de novo ; the Hawai #i Supreme Court
subsequently denied certiorari review. Trs. of Estate of Bishop v. Au, 141
Hawai #i 248, 407 P.3d 1284, CAAP-15-0000466, 2017 WL 6614566, at *1 (App.

Vexatious Litigant Order--have been decided, affirming the 
rulings made by Judge Nishimura. 
Thus, review of the question whether Judge Nishimura 
should have disqualified herself is moot. Poka v. Holi, 44 Haw. 
483, 483, 357 P.2d 110, 111 (1963) (holding that a motion to 
disqualify a judge is moot where the judge who presided over the 
trial is no longer on the bench); State v. Chatman, 144 Hawai
#i 
20, 434 P.3d 1215, SCWC-16-0000429, 2019 WL 912118, at *3 (Haw. Feb. 22, 2019) (SDO) ("Because the circuit court judge in this 
case has retired, the judge will not preside over any further 
proceedings involving [the Appellant]. Accordingly, [the 
Appellant's] Motion for Disqualification is moot.") (citing State 
v. Fukusaku, 85 Hawai
#i 462, 474-75, 946 P.2d 32, 44-45 (1997) 
("[T]he mootness doctrine is properly invoked where events have so affected relations between the parties that the two conditions 
for justiciability relevant on appeal--adverse interest and 
effective remedy--have been compromised.")) 
At best, Au's arguments amount to assertion that the 
collateral consequences exception applies. Hamilton ex rel. 
Lethem v. Lethem, 119 
Hawai# i 1, 5-10, 193 P.3d 839, 843-48 
(2008) (recognizing three exceptions to the mootness doctrine: "capable of repetition, yet evading review;" public interest and 
collateral consequences). 
Under the first exception, "[t]he phrase, 'capable of 
repetition, yet evading review.' means that 'a court will not 
dismiss a case on the grounds of mootness where a challenged 
governmental action would evade full review because the passage 
of time would prevent any single plaintiff from remaining subject 
to the restriction complained of for the period necessary to 
complete the lawsuit.'" In re Thomas
, 73 Haw. 223, 226-27, 832 
P.2d 253, 255 (1992) (quoting Life of the Land v. Burns
, 59 Haw. 
244, 251, 580 P.2d 402, 409-10 (1978). Where the issue is 
whether a judge should have recused him or herself, the mere 
passage of time would not prevent review as the time remaining on 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
a judge's term could easily exceed the time for an appeal to be 
completed. 
"When analyzing the public interest exception, [the 
appellate court] looks to (1)
 the public or private nature of the 
question presented, (2) the desirability of an authoritative determination for future guidance of public officers, and (3) the 
likelihood of future recurrence of the question." Hamilton, 119 
Hawai# i at 6-7, 193 P.3d at 844-45 (brackets omitted) (quoting 
Doe v. Doe, 116 Hawai 
#i 323, 327, 172 P.3d 1067, 1071 (2007)). 
In this jurisdiction, the public interest exception is primarily 
invoked in cases that "involve political or legislative matters 
that will affect a significant number of people." Hamilton, 119 
Hawai# i at 7, 193 P.3d at 845. In this case, the question 
presented is peculiar to the parties involved in this case. There is no evidence in the record that the issues presented are 
of a political or legislative nature or that they will affect a 
significant number of people. Thus, this case does not fall 
under the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine. 
Under the collateral consequences exception, a case 
will not be moot where "there is a reasonable possibility that 
prejudicial collateral consequences will occur." 
Hamilton at 8, 
193 P.3d at 846 (emphasis omitted); see State v. Nakanelua, 134 Hawai# i 489, 502-03, 345 P.3d 155, 169-70 (2015) (holding that 
the collateral consequences exception applies where an order remaining in place could be used against a party in later 
prohibited practice determinations); State v. Tierney, 127 
Hawai
#i 157, 172, 277 P.3d 251, 266 (2012) ("Criminal convictions 
have collateral consequences even after sentences have been served"). In this case, the Vexatious Litigant Order was 
affirmed on appeal by this court. Trs. of the Estate of Bernice 
Pauahi Bishop v. Au, 144 Hawai# i 434, 443 P.3d 126, CAAP-16-
0000235, 2019 WL 2714818, at *5 (App. Jul. 26, 2019) (SDO). As the validity of this order has already been reviewed and 
affirmed, the continued vitality of the Vexatious Litigant Order 
cannot be considered a prejudicial collateral consequence of the 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
denial of Au's efforts to have Judge Nishimura recused or 
disqualified and does not qualify under the collateral 
consequence exception to the mootness doctrine. 
For the foregoing reasons, this appeal is dismissed as 
moot.
