APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NOS. 13-1-0564(2) and 12-1-0642(2))
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
appellate jurisdiction over Plaintiff/Counterclaim-
Defendant/Appellant Association of Apartment Owners of Maui Sands
 II's (Maui Sands II' s) appeal from an "Order Denying Maui Sands
 
II's Motion for Reconsideration of the Court's October 23, 2017
 Order Denying Maui Sands II's Motion for Leave to File First
 Amended Complaint," issued by the Circuit Court of the Second
 Circuit (circuit court) on December 12, 2017, because the circuit
 
court has neither adjudicated claims nor reduced its dispositive
 
rulings to an appealable, final judgment.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
An aggrieved party cannot obtain appellate review of a 
circuit court's orders resolving claims in a civil case pursuant 
to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (2016) until the 
circuit court reduces such orders to an appealable, final 
judgment pursuant to Rule 58 of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP). See Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 
76 Hawai' i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994) ("An appeal may 
be taken from circuit court orders resolving claims against parties only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of or against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]"). "Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 
119 Hawai' i 245, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008). 
Here, the record on appeal does not include an
 
appealable, final judgment. Therefore, the "Order Denying Maui
 Sands II's Motion for Reconsideration of the Court's October 23,
 2017 Order Denying Maui Sands II's Motion for Leave to File First
 Amended Complaint" is ineligible for appellate review at this
 preliminary stage in the underlying case.
 
When the record on appeal indicates that the circuit 
court has resolved all claims against all parties, and the only thing lacking to perfect an aggrieved party's right to obtain appellate review is the entry of an appealable final judgment, this court invokes HRS § 602-57(3) (2016), and temporarily remands the case to the circuit court with instructions to enter, and supplement the record on appeal with, an appealable final judgment as to all claims and parties. Waikiki v. Ho' omaka 
Village Association of Apartment Owners, 140 Hawai' i 197, 204, 
398 P.3d 786, 793 (2017). That principle is inapplicable here, however, because the circuit court has not yet adjudicated claims asserted in Maui Sands II's "Complaint for Declaratory Relief and Damages" (Complaint) against Defendant/Counterclaimant/Appellee 
Association of Apartment Owners of Maui Sands I (Maui Sands I), 
or Maui Sands I's "[Maui Sands I's] Counterclaim to [Maui Sands 
II's] [Complaint]." Where, as here, the record on appeal does 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
not indicate that the circuit court has resolved all claims as to
 
all parties, a temporary remand with instructions to enter an
 appealable, final judgment is neither warranted nor authorized
 under HRS § 602-57(3) and the holding in Waikiki. In the absence
 of an appealable, final judgment, the appeal is premature and we
 lack appellate jurisdiction. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
 
case number CAAP-17-0000900 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
