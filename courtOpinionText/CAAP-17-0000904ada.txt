APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 3CC16-1-00308K) 
JANUARY 31, 2022 
LEONARD, PRESIDING JUDGE, HIRAOKA AND MCCULLEN, JJ. 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY LEONARD, J. FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
This appeal stems from the contention that an apartment 
owners association, after having nonjudicially foreclosed upon an 
assessment lien and thereby taking title to an apartment unit, has the right to maintain possession and retain rental proceeds from the unit even after a subsequent foreclosure decree and judgment has been entered against its ownership interest. For the reasons set forth below, we hold that the circuit court herein did not abuse its discretion in appointing a foreclosure commissioner to take possession and control of the subject unit upon the entry of the foreclosure decree and judgment. 
Under 
Hawai#i law, a judgment entered on a foreclosure decree is a 
final determination of a foreclosed party's ownership interests in the subject property – in other words, the property owner's ownership rights in the property are foreclosed, notwithstanding that further proceedings are necessary to enforce and otherwise effectuate the foreclosure decree and judgment. 
As discussed 
below, an association may nevertheless have the right to a special assessment against the purchaser of the foreclosed property, including when the foreclosing mortgagee is the purchaser. 
In this consolidated appeal, Defendant-Appellant 
Association of Apartment Owners of Elima Lani Condominiums (the AOAO) appeals from: 
(1) the November 29, 2017 Judgment 
(Foreclosure Judgment) entered by the Circuit Court of the Third

I. BACKGROUND 
On September 27, 2016, Bank of New York filed a 
Complaint for Mortgage Foreclosure (Complaint), alleging that on or about July 14, 2006, Defendants Mark L. Larrua aka Mark K. 
Larrua and Karlene L. Larrua (the Former Owners) executed a 
promissory note to Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., in the amount of 
$238,400 (Note), secured by a mortgage (Mortgage) on the subject 
Property (Property). The Complaint alleged that the Note was negotiated to Bank of New York, the Mortgage was assigned to Bank 
1 The Honorable Melvin H. Fujino presided.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of New York, and the assignment was recorded on June 26, 2012. 
Bank of New York further alleged that it is the current holder of the Note with standing to foreclose and that it was entitled to foreclose on the basis of the Former Owners' default on the Note.
2 
The Complaint alleged that the AOAO acquired an 
interest in the Property by virtue of a quitclaim deed recorded on June 29, 2015, but that the AOAO's interest, if any, is subordinate, subject, and/or junior to Bank of New York's mortgage lien. Bank of New York sought, inter alia: (1) that upon the foreclosure sale, any ownership or lien interest claimed by any named defendant be adjudicated subordinate to the lien of Bank of New York's mortgage; and (2) the appointment of a commissioner to take possession of the Property, collect rents, and deal with and sell the Property. 
In its November 15, 2016 answer to the Complaint 
(Answer), the AOAO admitted that it acquired an interest in the 
Property, but denied that its interest was subordinate, subject, 
and/or junior to Bank of New York's mortgage lien. The AOAO 
asserted an "Affirmative Statement of Claim," alleging that 
certain sums had been assessed against the Property and constituted a lien in favor of the AOAO and that the Former

enforce the Note. See U.S. Bank Trust, N.A., as Trustee for LSF9 Master

Owners had failed to pay an amount in excess of $24,0003 in 
outstanding assessments as of June 29, 2015. The AOAO sought, 
inter alia, dismissal of the Complaint as to the AOAO and for any proceeds from the sale of the Property be distributed in accordance with Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 514B-146(g) and 
(h) (Supp. 2017).

On September 7, 2017, Bank of New York filed a Motion 
for Summary and/or Default Judgment Against All Defendants and 
for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure (Motion for Summary 
Judgment), asserting that it had "established all the material facts to entitle it to summary judgment and a decree of

pay a total of "$24,477.36.26," so the exact amount of the alleged outstanding
assessments is unclear.

taxes, if any;

York] from [the Former Owners] under the Note and Mortgage,including principal, prepayment fees, late charges,insurance advances, title reports and other costs, expenses,and attorneys' fees, and that this Court make and enterjudgment as follows:

(Format altered). 
On September 26, 2017, the AOAO filed a limited 
memorandum in opposition to the Motion for Summary Judgment. The 
AOAO did not oppose Bank of New York's request to foreclose on the Mortgage, as a first priority lien against the Property. Rather, the AOAO opposed any relief whereby a foreclosure commissioner would take possession of or collect rental proceeds from the Property, and the AOAO requested that the Circuit Court reserve its ruling on the AOAO's right to collect a special assessment until the hearing on a motion to confirm sale. The AOAO asserted that it became the rightful owner on June 29, 2015, upon completion of a nonjudicial foreclosure of its assessment lien on the Property, and that HRS § 667-102(b)(4) (2016)
7 
6 Bank of New York did not seek a deficiency judgment against the
Former Owners. 
7 HRS § 667-102(b)(4) states: 
§ 667-102 Recordation of affidavit, conveyance
document; effect.  (a) The affidavit required under section
667-101 and the conveyance document shall be recorded no
earlier than ten days after the public sale is held but notlater than forty-five days after the public sale is held.

7 7(...continued)FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
conferred the AOAO with immediate and exclusive possession of the 
unit, thereby "effectuat[ing] a bar against any person claiming a right or interest in title." 
The AOAO argued that it should be 
allowed to continue to maintain possession of the Property, manage and preserve the Property, and, if appropriate, continue to rent the Property until a sale of Property was confirmed, rather than when the Foreclosure Decree was entered. 
The AOAO also cited HRS § 514B-146(k) (Supp. 2017)
8 as 
(b) When both the [section 667-101] affidavit and
the conveyance document are recorded:
. . . . 
(4) The purchaser shall be entitled to immediate andexclusive possession of the unit. 
8 HRS § 514B-146(k) (Supp. 2017), now codified at HRS § 514B-146(n)
(2018), states: 
§ 514B-146 Association fiscal matters; lien for
assessments. 
. . . . 
(k) After any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure
proceeding in which the association acquires title to theunit, any excess rental income received by the associationfrom the unit shall be paid to existing lien holders basedon the priority of lien, and not on a pro rata basis, andshall be applied to the benefit of the unit owner. 
For 
purposes of this subsection, excess rental income shall beany net income received by the association after a court hasissued a final judgment determining the priority of a seniormortgagee and after paying, crediting, or reimbursing theassociation or a third party for:
(1) The lien for delinquent assessments pursuant tosubsections (a) and (b);
(2) Any maintenance fee delinquency against theunit;
(3) Attorney's fees and other collection costsrelated to the association's foreclosure of the unit; or
(4) Any costs incurred by the association for therental, repair, maintenance, or rehabilitationof the unit while the association is in possession of the unit including monthlyassociation maintenance fees, management fees,

8 8(...continued)FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"clearly contemplat[ing]" the AOAO's continued possession and 
rental of the Property until completion of the Bank of New York's foreclosure action. 
Specifically, the AOAO asserted that the 
plain and unambiguous language of the statute requires an AOAO to pay to lienholders any excess rental income it receives after the issuance of a final judgment determining the priority of a senior mortgagee. The AOAO also stated that it continues to incur monthly expenses related to the operation and maintenance of the Property and argued that "[i]t would be inequitable and in violation of the plain language of HRS § 514B-146(k) to allow the lender to take advantage of [the AOAO]'s efforts and expenses, by appointing a commissioner to take possession of accounts and receivables that [the AOAO] has spent funds to generate, and hold or use them for [Bank of New York]'s benefit." 
Finally, the AOAO argued that unless and until Bank of 
New York acquires title to the Property, Bank of New York is not entitled to an order granting it the benefits of ownership through the efforts of a commissioner. The AOAO urged the Circuit Court to enter an appropriate order, allowing a commissioner to proceed without interfering with the AOAO's interests. 
real estate commissions, cleaning and repair
expenses for the unit, and general excise taxespaid on rental income;
provided that the lien for delinquent assessments underparagraph (1) shall be paid, credited, or reimbursed first. 
9 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In reply, Bank of New York took no position in regard 
to the AOAO's continued possession, management, and rental of the 
property, but requested that any argument as to the distribution of the rental proceeds collected by the AOAO and as to the AOAO's special assessment lien be reserved until the hearing to confirm the sale of the foreclosed property. 
Bank of New York also 
requested the AOAO be ordered to file an accounting prior to such hearing, setting forth all rent collected in regard to the Property from June 29, 2015, the date that the AOAO took title to the Property, to the date of the confirmation of the sale of the Property. 
At the October 5, 2017 hearing on the Motion for 
Summary Judgment, the parties reiterated their positions with respect to the commissioner's proposed duties. Bank of New York also requested a "full accounting" so it could analyze whether the AOAO is entitled to any of the amounts it collected. The AOAO countered that, pursuant to HRS § 514B-146(k), "the accounting should only start as of the entry of a judgment determining the priority of a senior mortgagee" and not from the date the AOAO became the owner in 2015. 
The Circuit Court indicated it would grant Bank of New 
York's Motion for Summary Judgment and stated: 
[T]he Court's inclined regarding the, uh, information
would be from the time the rents were collected would be 
appropriate for the, uh, plaintiff to have information inthat, not just when the Court orders it. 
Uh, furthermore after . . . the Court having granted
the motion for interlocutory decree would also, um, position 
10  
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
would be that the rent collected will be turned over to the 
commissioner. 
On November 29, 2017, the Circuit Court entered the 
Foreclosure Decree and Foreclosure Judgment and concluded in 
part: 
[COL] 2. [Bank of New York]'s Mortgage is a valid
mortgage lien on the Property. 
. . . . 
[COL] 7. [Bank of New York] is entitled to the entry
of default judgment against [the Former Owners] and summary
judgment against Defendant AOAO and an interlocutory decreeof foreclosure against all Defendants in the foreclosureaction. 
In the Foreclosure Decree, the Circuit Court ordered, 
inter alia: 
[FOF] 16. Defendant AOAO may continue collecting
rental proceeds from the Property until the Commissioner isappointed herein. Upon appointment of Commissioner,Commissioner shall collect the rental proceeds, thedistribution of proceeds (if any) shall be determined at theconfirmation hearing.

. . . . 
5. David E. Smith, Esq. [(the Commissioner )], is

A reasonable 
Commissioner's fees and costs shall be submitted to and awarded accordingly by the court, and shall be deemed to besecured by the Mortgage. 
. . . . 
7. Upon confirmation of the sale, the Commissioner is

11  
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
including advances, title search fees, costs, expenses, and
attorney's fees, as determined by this court. 
8. [Bank of New York], or its designee, is authorized
to be a purchaser at any sale, without the requirement ofany down payment at said sale. . . . 
. . . . 
11. Any and all interest of all named Defendants that
is junior to Plaintiff's interest is hereby terminated uponconveyance of the deed to the confirmed purchaser. 
. . . . 
14. This Court retains jurisdiction to ascertain the
total amount that is due and owing to [Bank of New York],consisting of the principal amount due under the LoanDocuments, together with interest, advances, late charges,expenses, costs, and attorney's fees thereon to the date ofconveyance of the Property by the Commissioner. 
. . . . 
16. This Court further retains jurisdiction to
determine among other matters which may later come beforethis Court, damages awarded to [Bank of New York], theamount of fees and costs of the Commissioner and [Bank ofNew York]'s attorneys and over any party to whom any surplus
shall be awarded. 
On December 20, 2017, the AOAO timely filed a notice of 
appeal from the Foreclosure Decree and Foreclosure Judgment, 
initiating CAAP-17-0000904. 
On December 22, 2017, the AOAO filed a Motion for a 
Stay Pending Appeal and To Set Supersedeas Bond (Motion for 
Stay). Following a January 26, 2018 hearing, the Circuit Court entered a March 6, 2018 Order Granting in Part and Denying in 
Part the [Motion for Stay]. The Circuit Court ordered as follows, in part: 
2. The Motion is granted to the extent that the
enforcement of the portions of the [Foreclosure Decree] and
the corresponding [Foreclosure Judgment] that authorize theCommissioner to take possession and control of and collectrental payments from [the Property] is hereby stayed pending[the AOAO]'s appeal of the same. The remainder of the 
12  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
[Foreclosure Decree] and [Foreclosure Judgment] are not
subject to the stay provided for herein. 
3. [The AOAO] shall be entitled to retain possession
and control of the Property and shall be entitled to collectrental payments from the Property until such time as theProperty is conveyed to a purchaser in this foreclosureaction. During this time, the Commissioner is notauthorized to take possession of the Property, and is notauthorized to collect monthly rental payments from theProperty. That notwithstanding the stay the Commissioner isentitled to proceed with scheduling and conducting the twoopen houses, publishing a foreclosure notice, conducting theforeclosure auction and conveying the Property to thesuccessful bidder, all as had been previously ordered bythis Court. 
4. The Motion is DENIED with respect to [the AOAO]'s
request to post alternative security, in lieu of asupersedeas bond, in the form of monthly rental paymentsinto a Court-supervised rent trust account during the periodfollowing the issuance of the Order to the conveyance of theProperty to a purchaser in this foreclosure action.Instead, the supersedeas bond amount shall be $45,000.00,which is equivalent to 36 months of $1,250.00 monthly rentalpayments. 
The AOAO filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the 
Circuit Court's order, which Bank of New York opposed and the 
Circuit Court denied. The AOAO did not post a supersedeas bond. 
On March 28, 2018, the Commissioner filed his report, 
stating, inter alia, that Bank of New York had bid highest at theforeclosure auction. The Commissioner submitted an explanation  
of fees and costs totaling $6,584.81 and requested: 
A. That the Court approve your Commissioner's Report. 
B. That a hearing be held to confirm the sale of the
subject property to [Bank of New York], for the sales price
of $188,112.75. 
C. That the Court allow your Commissioner
reimbursement of expenses incurred and award Commissioner'sfees in an amount to be determined by the Court upon theconfirmation hearing and finally approved by theCommissioner's Final Accounting. 
D. That upon your Commissioner conveying the subject
property to the party to whom the sale thereof is confirmed,distributing the funds, if any, to those persons and partiesin the amounts and in the order of priority directed by this 
13  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Court, and your Commissioner filing his distribution
statement, attaching receipts, if any, of these amounts fromthese persons or parties who are entitled to receive suchamounts, your Commissioner stand discharged from any furtherresponsibility and liability. 
The AOAO did not object to the Commissioner's Report. 
On April 16, 2018, Bank of New York filed its Motion 
for Order Confirming Foreclosure Sale, Approving Commissioner's Report, Allowance of Commissioner's Fees, Attorneys' Fees, Costs, Directing Conveyance and for Writ of Ejectment (Confirmation 
Motion). Bank of New York requested that the Circuit Court order, inter alia: 
7. That this Court direct the Commissioner or escrow 
agent to disburse the fees, expenses and costs approved by
this Court upon the conveyance of the Property hereinauthorized and the total purchase price of $188,112.75 shallbe disbursed as follows: 
a. First, to the Commissioner, the net sum of
$6,584.81; 
b. Second, to [Bank of New York], the total amounts
owed as of the date of closing, including allattorneys' fees and costs awarded, in accordancewith bank wiring and other written instructionsprovided by TMLF Hawaii, LLLC to theCommissioner or escrow, as appropriate; and 
c. In the event there are any remaining funds after[Bank of New York] has been paid, said fundsshall be deposited with the Clerk of Court. 
. . . . 
9. That all named Defendants junior to [Bank of New
York]'s interest shall be terminated from right, title, andinterest in the Property. 
10. That rent on the Property collected by the
Commissioner, if any, shall be paid to [Bank of New York]and forwarded in care of [Bank of New York]'s attorneys,which sum shall be credited against the amounts due [Bank ofNew York] under its Note and Mortgage. 
Opposing in part the Confirmation Motion, the AOAO 
asserted its "statutory right to collect a special assessment on 
14 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the [Property]" and requested the Circuit Court "give priority to 
the [AOAO]'s statutory lien on the Property, permitting the [AOAO] to collect the six-month special assessment" pursuant to HRS § 514B-146(g) and (h) (Supp. 2017).
9 The AOAO also opposed 
the request for any rent collected by the Commissioner be paid to Bank of New York, again citing HRS § 514B-146(k) (Supp. 2017) and HRS § 667-102(b)(4). Finally, the AOAO opposed Bank of New York's request for attorneys' fees as unreasonably high and not reflecting time actually spent on the matter. 
At a May 16, 2018 hearing on the Confirmation Motion, 
Bank of New York did not object to the Association's six-month special assessment. The Commissioner noted that the Property was currently occupied by tenants but that, to date, the Commissioner had not collected any rent because it had been paid to the AOAO. The Circuit Court orally ruled that the rent collected by the AOAO from the time the Plaintiff took possession "shall be turned over to the Plaintiff, however the Court will find that the six months special assessment fee will apply in this case, but not in excess of that special assessment. The rest of the rent should be turned over to the Plaintiff." 
On July 5, 2018, the Circuit Court entered the 
Confirmation Order. The Circuit Court ordered, inter alia: 
9 The AOAO acknowledged that HRS § 667-102(b)(3) extinguished "the
lien it foreclosed on in its nonjudicial foreclosure" but argued that the
Property remained a "delinquent unit" for purposes of the special assessmentstatute. 
15  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2. That the Commissioner's Report filed herein is
hereby ratified, approved and confirmed. 
3. That the sale of the Property to [Bank of New
York] at the sale price of $188,112.75 is ratified, approved
and confirmed. 
4. That upon receipt of the full purchase price,
Commissioner is hereby ordered and directed to make aconveyance of the title to the Property to [Bank of NewYork]. 
. . . . 
9. That upon the conveyance of the Property herein
authorized, the total purchase price of $
188,112.75 shall be
disbursed as follows: 
a. First, to the Commissioner, the net sum of
$6,584.81. 
b. Second, to [Bank of New York], the total
amounts owed as of the date of closing, including allattorneys' costs awarded herein, in accordance withbank wiring and other written instructions provided byTMLF Hawaii LLLC to the Commissioner or escrow, asappropriate; and 
10. That rent on the Property collected by the
Commissioner, if any, shall be paid to [Bank of New York]
and forwarded in care of [Bank of New York]'s attorneys. 
. . . . 
12. That all named Defendants that are junior to
Plaintiff's interest shall be terminated from any right,title, and interest in the Property. 
. . . . 
17. Defendant [AOAO]'s request for six months special
assessment pursuant to [HRS] § 514B-146(g) and (h) isgranted. 
The Circuit Court also entered the Confirmation 
Judgment on July 5, 2018. On July 18, 2018, the AOAO timely 
filed a notice of appeal from the Confirmation Order and Judgment, initiating CAAP-18-0000571. 
On April 24, 2019, this court consolidated the two 
appeals under CAAP-17-0000904. 
16 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
II. POINTS OF ERROR 
The AOAO raises three points of error. 
In CAAP-17-
0000904, challenging the Foreclosure Decree, the AOAO contends 
that the Circuit Court erred in: (1) ordering the Commissioner to take possession and control of the Property owned by the AOAO, including collecting rental payments; and (2) ordering the Commissioner to pay Bank of New York all of the rental income collected from the Property. In CAAP-18-0000571, challenging the Confirmation Order, the AOAO contends the Circuit Court erred in ordering the Commissioner to pay Bank of New York "all of the rental income collected from the Property." Although not identified as a point of error, in the appeal from the Confirmation Order, the AOAO also argues the Circuit Court erred when it purportedly vested the Commissioner with title to the Property. III. APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
This court "review[s] an award of summary judgment de 
novo under the same standard applied by the circuit court." HSBC 
Bank USA, Nat'l Ass'n v. Moore, 144 Hawai# i 49, 53, 434 P.3d 
1244, 1248 (App. 2018) (quoting Salera v. Caldwell, 137 Hawai# i 
409, 415, 375 P.3d 188, 194 (2016)). 
"Summary judgment is 
appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment 
17 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
as a matter of law." Id.
 (quoting Caldwell, 137 Hawai# i at 415, 
375 P.3d at 194). 
"The court views all the evidence and 
inferences in the light most favorable to the party opposing the 
motion." Bank of Am., N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai# i 361, 367 
n.9, 390 P.3d 1248, 1254 n.9 (2017) (citation omitted). 
"The 
moving party bears the burden of demonstrating that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact with respect to the essential elements of the claim[.]" Id. (citation omitted). 
The interpretation of a statute is a question of law 
which the appellate court reviews

ordering the Commissioner to take possession and control of the Property "despite the [AOAO]'s statutory right to exclusive possession of the Property." The AOAO argues that the 
Commissioner's possession of the Property runs afoul of HRS 
§ 667-102(b)(4) (2016) and the AOAO's entitlement to exclusive possession of the Property upon completion of its nonjudicial foreclosure in 2015. 
HRS § 667-102 provides, in pertinent part: 
§ 667-102 Recordation of affidavit, conveyance
document; effect.  (a) The affidavit required under section
667-101 and the conveyance document shall be recorded no
earlier than ten days after the public sale is held but not 
19 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
later than forty-five days after the public sale is
held. . . . 
(b) When both the affidavit and the conveyance
document are recorded : 
(1) The sale of the unit is considered completed;
(2) All persons claiming by, through, or under theunit owner and all other persons having liens onthe unit junior to the lien of the associationshall be forever barred of and from any and allright, title, interest, and claims at law or inequity in and to the unit and every part of theunit, except as otherwise provided by law;
(3) The lien of the association and all liens juniorin priority to the lien of an association shallbe automatically extinguished from the unit; and
(4) The purchaser shall be entitled to immediate andexclusive possession of the unit . 
(Emphasis added). 
In conjunction with its nonjudicial foreclosure of its 
lien, HRS § 667-102(b)(4) provided the AOAO with immediate and 
exclusive possession of the unit upon the recordation of both the affidavit and the conveyance document. 
Nonetheless, nothing in HRS § 667-102 precludes the 
appointment of a Commissioner to possess and control the Property upon a pre-existing mortgagee's subsequent judicial foreclosure of the Property.

title is subject to a mortgage or deed of trust, but the transfer will not eliminate the existence of that encumbrance." 55 Am. Jur. 2d Mortgages

[i]f the real property is sold subject to an existing

20 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
takes the land subject to encumbrances without a personal
obligation to pay the debt. However, the buyer may lose theproperty if the mortgage debt is not paid, because theseller, the mortgagor, is not required to use funds paid toit for the payment of the mortgage, and the property becomesa source of repayment for the debt. 
55 Am. Jur. 2d Mortgages § 957, Westlaw (database updated 
November 2021). 
Here, the AOAO's Quitclaim Deed stated that the AOAO 
took title of the Property "subject . . . to all encumbrances of record" – specifically the Bank of New York Mortgage – a fact that the AOAO did not and does not challenge. In accordance with the terms of the Mortgage, based upon the Former Owners' default, Bank of New York initiated foreclosure proceedings and, based upon the evidence presented in conjunction with the Motion for Summary Judgment, the Circuit Court granted the motion and entered the Foreclosure Decree and Foreclosure Judgment. 
It is important to note that under Hawai# i law, it is 
well-established that a judgment entered on a foreclosure decree is a final determination of the parties' rights in the subject property – in other words, the property owners' rights in the property are foreclosed, notwithstanding that further proceedings are necessary to enforce and otherwise effectuate the foreclosure decree and judgment. 
The Hawai# i Supreme Court has articulated 
this tenet as follows: 
A judgment of foreclosure of mortgage or other lien and sale
of foreclosed property is final, although it contains adirection to commissioners to make a report of sale and tobring the proceeds into court for an order regarding theirdisposition. This is on the ground that such judgmentfinally determines the merits of the controversy, and 
21 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
subsequent proceedings are simply incidents to its
enforcement. 
MDG Supply, Inc. v. Diversified Invs., Inc., 51 Haw. 375, 380, 
463 P.2d 525, 528 (1969) (citations omitted). 
Accordingly, in this case, the Foreclosure Decree and 
Foreclosure Judgment foreclosed the AOAO's ownership interest in the Property, even though legal title would not pass until the sale of foreclosed property was complete. In addition, since "[f]oreclosure is an equitable action," the Circuit Court "has the plenary power to fashion a decree to conform to the equitable requirements of the situation."

P.3d at 185 ("In a judicial foreclosure action, the circuit court has broad discretion to order execution on its own judgments."). This court has summarized that: 
As a practical matter, the court must exercise its 
equitable powers, pending final resolution of a foreclosure,
through its appointed commissioner . 
It is well settled that a commissioner is a neutral 
party appointed by the court and acts as an arm of thecourt. We have stated that "the commissioner is an agentacting in the court's behalf[.]" Hoge v. Kane
, 4 Haw. App.
533, 539, 670 P.2d 36, 40 (1983). 
As a neutral party, the commissioner does not act at
the behest of the mortgagee, the mortgagor or any otherinterested party. See 4

entitled to subtenant rents collected by a Commissioner during a foreclosure

the Commissioner's "duty to preserve the mortgaged property . . . encompassedthe obligation to pay the ground rent to Bishop Estate in order to preserve
the ground leases." Id. at 348, 55 P.3d at 841. On certiorari , the supreme
court vacated the ICA's holding, relying on the "imminent expiration of the
lease terms." Hawai #i Nat'l Bank II, 100 Hawai #i at 12, 58 P.3d at 70. The

public auction, subject to confirmation by the Circuit Court. 
This is consistent with the Circuit Court's equitable powers and standard practice to utilize a foreclosure commissioner to facilitate a foreclosure sale and ensure preservation of the Property for the subsequent purchaser, after the entry of the foreclosure decree and judgment. See Hawaii Nat'l Bank I, 99 
Hawai#i at 346-47, 55 P.3d at 840-41; Peak Capital Group, LLC, 
141 Hawai# i at 166, 407 P.3d at 122 (appointing commissioner to 
sell property at public auction); 
Hawai#i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) Rule 66 ("The practice in the administration of 
estates by receivers or by other similar officers appointed by the court
 shall be in accordance with the practice heretofore 
followed.") (emphasis added). The Commissioner's possession and 
control of the Property is concomitant with the fulfillment of his equitable duty to preserve the Property and to execute the court's orders. Denying possession and control to an entity whose rights in the property have been foreclosed, with no duty – and, perhaps, no incentive – to facilitate a timely foreclosure sale (in this case, the AOAO) is not inequitable. 
The AOAO nevertheless argues that "a mortgagee does not 
acquire title – and therefore . . . should not be entitled to the benefits of property – until a foreclosure sale is completed as defined by HRS § 514B-146(b)." The AOAO cites the "lien theory" 
24 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of mortgages,  asserting that it was "the holder of both legal 
and equitable title to the Property when the court issued the 
[Foreclosure Decree] directing the Commissioner to take possession of the Property" and that, since Bank of New York was not the owner of the Property, it was "not entitled to an order granting it the benefits of ownership of the [AOAO]'s efforts through a commissioner" and "had no legal basis to assert a right to possession" of the Property. As set forth above, however, the Commissioner is a neutral party acting for the court, not the mortgagee, upon the court's entry of the foreclosure decree and judgment. 11
We nevertheless have considered the statute relied on 
by the AOAO. In pertinent part, HRS § 514B-146(b) (Supp. 2017) provided: 
§ 514B-146 Association fiscal matters; lien for
assessments. 
. . . . 
(b)
 Except as provided in subsection (g), when the

The unpaid share of common expenses or assessments shall bedeemed to be common expenses collectible from all of theunit owners, including the acquirer and the acquirer'ssuccessors and assigns.

(Emphasis added). 
We conclude that HRS § 514B-146(b) plainly and simply 
establishes precisely when a mortgagee, or other purchaser who 
takes title to a unit after a mortgage foreclosure, must begin paying the common expenses and assessments for the unit. See 
First Hawaiian Bank v. Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Sun Rise, Inc., CAAP-16-0000430, 2019 WL 3764659, *3-4 (Haw. App. Aug. 9, 2019) (SDO) (analyzing when the purchasing mortgagee in that case was deemed to have acquired title under HRS § 514B-146(b) following entry of the order confirming sale). HRS § 514B-146(b) does not address the propriety of appointing a commissioner to take possession of the property and facilitate the foreclosure sale process, after the determination in the foreclosure decree that the rights of the owner(s) and any junior lienors are foreclosed. As such, nothing in the Circuit Court's order is contrary to HRS § 514B-146(b).

The AOAO also asserts that because HRS § 514B-146(k) 
(Supp. 2017) "contemplates" the AOAO receiving rental income from 
the Property following the entry of a foreclosure decree, the AOAO "should have been allowed to continue to maintain possession of the Property" from the date of the Foreclosure Decree until completion of the foreclosure sale, as such completion is defined in HRS § 514B-146.

Hanohano Hale
). In Hanohano Hale, we summarized the facts 
pertaining to the AOAO therein's nonjudicial foreclosure of its 
assessment lien and concluded as follows: 
[T]he AOAO had an automatic statutory lien on the
Property that arose pursuant to HRS § 514B-146(a) for unpaid
assessments. The AOAO properly filed the lien in the LandCourt on April 3, 2014. Pursuant to HRS § 514B-146(a), theAOAO then elected to pursue nonjudicial foreclosureproceedings following the procedures set forth in HRS §§667-91 through 667-104 (2016). HRS § 667-102(b)(3) (2016)provides that, after the affidavit and conveyance documentfor a nonjudicial foreclosure are recorded, "[t]he lien ofthe association . . . shall be automatically extinguishedfrom the unit[.]" Based on the plain language of HRS § 667-102(b)(3), the AOAO's election to pursue nonjudicial
foreclosure proceedings therefore extinguished its statutorylien for the delinquent assessments. See First Ins. Co. of 
Hawaii v. A&B Props., 126 Hawai #i 406, 414, 271 P.3d 1165,
1173 (2012) ("[T]he fundamental starting point forstatutory-interpretation is the language of the statuteitself." (Citation omitted)). 
However, citing to HRS § 667-103 (2016), the AOAO
argues that the Property was still delinquent because theAOAO did not recover the full amount of the delinquency atthe nonjudicial foreclosure sale. We do not agree with theAOAO's interpretation of HRS § 667-103. Rather, we conclude 
that HRS § 667-103 relates to the debt personal to the unitowners, unattached to the Property, if the debt is not fullysatisfied. This, however, does not affect our conclusion
that the AOAO's lien on the Property for unpaid assessmentshad been extinguished, pursuant to HRS § 667-102(b)(3). In other words, the prior owner's debt to the AOAO could remainbut the Property itself was no longer subject to a lien infavor of the AOAO. 
. . . . 
[R]eading HRS § 514B-146(k)(1) in pari materia  with 
HRS § 667-102(b)(3)—which expressly extinguished the lien ofthe AOAO—we construe HRS § 514B-146(k)(1) as referring tothe amount owed for the delinquent assessments thattriggered the lien in the first place. 
In other words, HRS 
§ 514B-146(k) addresses how an association should deal with"excess rental income" after a foreclosure proceeding inwhich the association acquires title to a unit, and thestatute provides for determining excess rental income as netincome received by the association after, inter alia ,
paying, crediting, or reimbursing the association foramounts owed for delinquent assessments . Although
subsection (k)(1) refers to "[t]he lien[,]" we do not readthat language as intending that a lien continues to existgiven the contrary and more specific language in HRS § 667-102(b)(3) providing that "[w]hen both the affidavit and theconveyance documents are recorded: . . . [t]he lien of the 
29 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
association . . . shall be automatically extinguished from
the unit[.]" 
Id. at *3-*4 (footnotes omitted) (emphasis added). 
In short, as this court concluded in Hanohano Hale, 
once an AOAO has completed its nonjudicial foreclosure, its 
assessment lien on the unit is extinguished and "the amount owed for the delinquent assessments that triggered the lien in the first place" are merely a personal debt owed by the former unit owner. Id. at *4. HRS § 514B-146(k) therefore addresses only 
how an AOAO must utilize any rental income it receives after its own foreclosure on the unit, when its interest is subsequently foreclosed upon by a mortgagee, instructing it to pay amounts for delinquent assessments that might remain outstanding against the unit owner, maintenance fee delinquencies, fees and costs related to the AOAO's foreclosure, and any costs incurred by the association while in possession of the unit. The statute does not, however, necessarily entitle an AOAO to receive such rental income from a unit following the subsequent entry of a foreclosure decree and judgment in favor of a mortgagee. 
The legislative history of HRS § 514B-146(k) (Supp. 
2017) supports this interpretation. Cf. State v. Entrekin, 98 
Hawai#i 221, 227, 47 P.3d 336, 342 (2002) ("Although we ground 
our holding in the statute's plain language, we nonetheless note that its legislative history confirms our view.") (citing Crichfield v. Grand Wailea Co., 93 Hawai# i 477, 488-89, 6 P.3d 
349, 360-61 (2000); State v. Ramela, 77 Hawai# i 394, 396 n.3, 885 
30 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
P.2d 1135, 1137 n.3 (1994)). 
The stated purpose of the statute 
is to "[s]pecify how rental income received by a condominium 
association after a foreclosure proceeding shall be paid to existing lien holders." Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 57, in 2013 House Journal at 1539, 2013 Senate Journal at 799 (emphasis added). 
As the Committee on Conference recognized: 
[T]he costs of default in a condominium are
substantially born by condominium associations and non-
defaulting unit owners and mortgagors in the affectedcommunities. The lending industry also has an interest inpreserving the value of the condominium projects that makeup part of the lending industry's collateral. 
. . . [B]ecause there are legitimate but competing issues
relating to common assessments, the needs of the lendingindustry and condominium associations and non-defaultingunit owners must be appropriately balanced when attemptingto create a priority lien for common assessments.
16 This 
measure achieves this balance by providing condominiumassociations and non-defaulting unit owners with reliefwhile also addressing interests of the lending industry. 
Id. 
Consistent with these determinations, the legislature 
enacted the excess rental income provision to direct an 
association to apply any rental income to those expenses incurreddue to the unit owner's default only to the extent necessary to "provid[e] condominium associations and non-defaulting unit  
owners with relief." Id.However, anything in excess of the 
amounts necessary to accomplish that would be paid to existing 
16 Prior versions of the bill sought to create an unlimited priority
lien for unpaid common assessments over the lien of any mortgage as a way of
assisting condominium associations with the collection of unpaid assessments.H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 914, in 2013 House Journal, at 1225. 
31 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
lienholders, thereby "addressing [the] interests of the lending 
industry." Id.Accordingly, the goal in enacting HRS § 514B
-
146(k) was not to ensure the AOAO's receipt of rental income after a foreclosure judgment but to specify the proper allocation of any such income between the AOAO and a mortgagee. In other words, while the statutory language may contemplate the AOAO receiving rental income from a unit after the entry of a foreclosure decree and judgment, it does not go so far as entitling the AOAO to such income. 
Importantly, the excess rental income provision was 
enacted together with the provision entitling the association to a six-month special assessment specifically against a senior-mortgagee purchaser, which it previously was not entitled to. 2013 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 196, § 1 at 629 (eliminating language exempting a senior mortgagee from the subsection allowing for a special assessment against a subsequent purchaser); Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 57, 2013 House Journal at 1539, 2013 Senate Journal at 799; see also HRS § 514B-146(g) and(h) (Supp. 2017) (providing for special assessment). This supports a conclusion that the special assessment, rather than the excess rental income provision, was enacted to particularly benefit the association. 
Accordingly, we conclude that HRS § 514B-146(k) does 
not affect the Circuit Court's equitable powers to appoint a 
32 . . . . FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
commissioner to take possession and control of the Property upon 
the entry of a foreclosure decree and 
judgment.17 We conclude 
that the Circuit Court did not err or abuse its equitable powers in directing the Commissioner to take possession of the Property upon the entry of the Foreclosure Decree and Foreclosure Judgment. 
B. Payment of Rental Income to Bank of New York The AOAO contends that the Circuit Court erred in the 
Foreclosure Decree, when it ordered the Commissioner to pay Bank of New York "all" of the rental income collected from the Property. To the extent that the AOAO's argument is based on its interpretation of HRS § 514B-146(k), we have rejected that argument above. 
Moreover, the Foreclosure Decree did not order payment 
to Bank of New York of "all of the rental income collected from the Property." Instead, the decree states, in pertinent part: 
[FOF] 16. Defendant AOAO may continue collecting
rental proceeds from the Property until the Commissioner is
appointed herein. Upon appointment of Commissioner,Commissioner shall collect the rental proceeds, thedistribution of proceeds (if any) shall be determined at theconfirmation hearing.
17 We note that the AOAO failed to discuss or even acknowledge that
the Circuit Court granted in part the AOAO's Motion to Stay the ForeclosureDecree, to the extent that it authorized the Commissioner to take possessionof the Property and to collect rents, with the posting of a supersedeas bond.We further note that, even though the AOAO apparently declined to post a bond,at the hearing on the Confirmation Order, the Commissioner represented that hehad not collected any rents. 
33  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
[Order] 7. Upon confirmation of the sale, the
Commissioner is authorized and directed, after the payment
of all necessary expenses of such sale, to make applicationof all the proceeds thereof and all funds which they hold intheir capacity as Commissioner so far as the same may benecessary to the payment of amounts found due and owing to[Bank of New York] from the [Former Owners] under the LoanDocuments, including advances, title search fees, costs,expenses, and attorney's fees, as determined by this court. 
The Circuit Court's order includes certain conditional 
occurrences (e.g., the Circuit Court's confirmation of the sale, 
its determination of amounts due and owing to Bank of New York, the collection of any rental income by the Commissioner) before the Commissioner's payment of proceeds to Bank of New York might potentially include rental income collected from the Property. Accordingly, the AOAO's contention that the Circuit Court erred in the Foreclosure Decree when it directed all rental income to Bank of New York is without merit. 
C. Appeal from the Confirmation Order and Judgment In its appeal from the Confirmation Judgment and 
Confirmation Order, the AOAO contends that the Circuit Court erred when it "purported to pass equitable and legal title to the Commissioner, effective November 29, 2017 [the date of entry of the Foreclosure Decree]," contrary to legal authority. The AOAO again cites the lien theory of mortgages, arguing that a borrower's default does not entitle a mortgagee to possession, rents, or profits. The AOAO asserts that it rightfully retained both equitable and legal title upon the entry of the Foreclosure 
34 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Decree, since the foreclosure sale had not yet been completed 
pursuant to HRS § 514B-146(b) and that, accordingly, the mortgagee did not acquire title to or the benefits of the Property until that time. 
However, the AOAO does not explain how, by way of the 
Confirmation Order, the Circuit Court vested the Commissioner with title to the 
Property.18 To the extent that the scope of 
the Commissioner's powers and directives are properly before this court, we have addressed it above, in conjunction with the AOAO's appeal from the Foreclosure Judgment and Foreclosure Decree. 
Finally, the AOAO contends that the Circuit Court erred 
in ordering that "the rent on the Property collected by the Commissioner, if any, shall be paid to [Bank of New York] and forwarded in care of [Bank of New York]'s attorneys." The AOAO again cites HRS § 667-102(b) to argue that, as the owner of the Property, the AOAO was entitled to exclusive possession of the Property and to receive all rents obtained or collected from it, 
18 The AOAO also does not state where in the record the alleged error
occurred and where in the record the alleged error was objected to or the
manner in which the alleged error was brought to the attention of the CircuitCourt. See Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(4) ("Points not
presented in accordance with this section will be disregarded[.]") 
The 
Foreclosure Decree does not purport to vest legal title in the Commissioner,although it authorizes and directs the Commissioner to make a delivery to thehighest bidder "an appropriate instrument of conveyance of title to theProperty upon confirmation of the sale" by the Circuit Court. In the 
Confirmation Order, inter alia , the Commissioner was authorized and directed
to make a conveyance of title to the purchaser upon receipt of the fullpurchase price. The Confirmation Order concluded, inter alia , that upon the
delivery to the purchaser of the conveyance, the interest of all named
defendants in the property was terminated. 
35  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
even after the entry of the Foreclosure Decree and Judgment. 
The AOAO further cites HRS § 514B-146(k) (Supp. 2017), arguing that the Circuit Court should have allowed the AOAO to retain rental proceeds from the Property until completion of the foreclosure sale under HRS § 514B-146(b). 
As discussed above, HRS § 667-102(b) does not bar a 
Circuit Court's appointment of a commissioner upon the entry of a foreclosure decree and judgment. 
Also as addressed above, HRS § 514B-146(k) (Supp. 
2017) does not necessarily entitle the AOAO to receive rental income from a unit after the entry of a foreclosure decree and judgment in favor of the pre-existing mortgagee, but merely addresses the allocation of any such income. 
Moreover, the Confirmation Order does not pertain to 
any income "received by the association" or otherwise affect the distribution or allocation of any such income. 
Instead, it only 
concerns distribution of "the rent on the Property collected by 
the Commissioner, if any." The Confirmation Order does not purport to entitle the Commissioner to the collection of rental 
income or Bank of New York to the receipt of all income received from the Property, in particular, the rents collected by the AOAO. 
36 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Accordingly, we conclude that the AOAO's appeal from 
the Confirmation Order is without merit. 
V. CONCLUSION 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's November 29, 
2017 Foreclosure Judgment and July 5, 2018 Confirmation Judgment are affirmed.
