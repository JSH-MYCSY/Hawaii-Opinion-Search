NO. CAAP-17-0000905
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
YVONNE DUCOSIN, Appellant-Appellant
v.
HAWAII PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITY, Appellee-Appellee.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 16-1-2230)
ORDER
DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
AND DISMISSING ALL PENDING MOTIONS AS MOOT
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
appellate jurisdiction under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 
§ 641-1(a)(2016) to review Appellant-Appellant Yvonne Ducosin's
(Ducosin), pro se, appeal in CAAP-17-0000905 from the Oahu
Eviction Board's November 1, 2017 amended findings of fact,
conclusions of law and decision (the November 1, 2017 amended
decision) regarding Appellee-Appellee Hawai #i Public Housing
Authority's (State Public Housing Authority) decision to evict
Ducosin from public housing, because the circuit court, the
Honorable Keith K. Hiraoka presiding, is presently reviewing the
November 1, 2017 amended decision in Civil No. 16-1-2230-12, and
the circuit court has neither announced its final decision nor
entered a final judgment.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
When an aggrieved party seeks review of an agency
decision, "[e]xcept as otherwise provided herein, proceedings for
review shall be instituted in the circuit court, or, if
applicable, the environmental court[.]" HRS § 91-14(a) (2012 &
Supp. 2017).  Ducosin's appeal, initially from the Oahu Eviction
Board's original decision, is still pending before the circuit
court for a final decision and judgment on the Oahu Eviction
Board's November 1, 2017 amended decision in Civil No. 
16-1-2230-12.  The circuit court's July 3, 2017 order and 
July 14, 2017 amended order temporarily remanded this case to the
Oahu Eviction Board with instructions for Ducosin to submit
additional evidence at a new hearing before the Oahu Eviction
Board.  The circuit court ordered the temporary remand pursuant
to HRS § 91-14(e) (2012 & Supp. 2017), which authorizes a
temporary remand before the circuit court holds its hearing on
the merits of an administrative appeal:
(e) If, before the date set for hearing , application
is made to the court for leave to present additional
evidence material to the issue in the case, and it is shown
to the satisfaction of the court that the additional
evidence is material and that there were good reasons for
failure to present it in the proceeding before the agency,
the court may order that the additional evidence be taken
before the agency upon such conditions as the court deems
proper. The agency may modify its findings, decision, and
order by reason of the additional evidence and shall file
with the reviewing court, to become a part of the record,
the additional evidence, together with any modifications or
new findings or decision.
(Emphases added).  The circuit court did not reduce its HRS 
§ 91-14(e) temporary remand orders to a final decision in a
separate judgment.  We note that HRS § 91-14(g) (2012 & Supp.
2017) authorizes the circuit court, " [u]pon review of the
record," to vacate and remand an administrative agency's final
decision as the circuit court's final decision and final judgment
in the administrative appeal:
(g) Upon review of the record, the court may  affirm
the decision of the agency or remand the case with
instructions for further proceedings; or it may reverse or
modify the decision and order if the substantial rights of
the petitioners may have been prejudiced because the
administrative findings, conclusions, decisions, or orders
are:
(1) In violation of constitutional or statutory
provisions;
-2-NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(2) In excess of the statutory authority or
jurisdiction of the agency;
(3) Made upon unlawful procedure;
(4) Affected by other error of law;
(5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative,
and substantial evidence on the whole record; or
(6) Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized by
abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted
exercise of discretion.
(Emphases added).  In short, the circuit court in the instant
case has not yet rendered a final decision and entered a final
judgment in Ducosin's administrative appeal.
HRS § 641-1(a) does not authorize appeals directly from
administrative agencies.  Appeals from a civil circuit court case
under HRS § 641-1(a) "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided
by the rules of court."  HRS § 641-1(c).  Rule 58 of the Hawai# i
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) requires that "[e]very judgment
shall be set forth on a separate document."  Based on this
requirement under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai# i has
held that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders
have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered
in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to
HRCP [Rule] 58[.]"  Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright , 
76 Hawai# i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994).  On February 5,
2018, the circuit court clerk filed the record on appeal for
Ducosin's appeal in CAAP-17-0000905, which does not contain a
final judgment in Civil No. 16-1-2230-12.  Therefore, under the
holding in Jenkins, we must dismiss CAAP-17-0000905 for lack of
appellate jurisdiction.1  
Michael J. Green is listed in the record on appeal as
Ducosin's counsel of record, presumably because the circuit court
issued an order (and subsequently an amended order) that
purported to "grant" Green's Oral Special Appearance on behalf of
1Furthermore, we lack the authority to remand the case to
the circuit court with instructions to enter an appealable final
judgment because the record indicates that the circuit court has
not yet announced its final decision on the merits of Ducosin's
administrative appeal from the Oahu Eviction Board's November 1,
2017 amended decision.

Ducosin without explaining what such a special appearance was
for, how it was authorized, or what it was intended to reflect
with regard to on-going representation of Ducosin.  This appeal,
however, was filed by a non-party named Dianne K. Hoapili aka
Ku'uleimomo 'O Pa'ahao.  Hoapili represents that she is not an
attorney, but makes the filing as yet another "special
appearance."  Under HRS § 605-2 (2016) and HRS § 605-14 (2016),
non-attorneys "are not permitted to act as attorneys and
represent other natural persons in their causes."  Oahu Plumbing
and Sheet Metal, Ltd. v. Kona Constr., Inc., 60 Haw. 372, 377,
590 P.2d 570, 573 (1979) (citation and footnote omitted).  "Any
person violating sections 605-14 to 605-16 shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor."  HRS § 605-17 (2016).  If a licensed attorney does
not represent Ducosin in court proceedings, then Ducosin herself
must sign and file all of her court documents; otherwise, any
such documents signed by a non-attorney are invalid.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
case number CAAP-17-0000905 is dismissed for lack of appellate
jurisdiction.
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions
in CAAP-17-0000905 are dismissed as moot.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, February 26, 2018.
