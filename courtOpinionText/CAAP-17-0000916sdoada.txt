STATE OF HAWAI#I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
FRED F. FARZAMI, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
HONOLULU DIVISION
(CASE NO. 1DTI-17-010275)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Ginoza, C.J., and Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Fred F. Farzami appeals from the
Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, filed
on December 26, 2017, in the District Court of the First Circuit,
Honolulu Division ("District Court").   Judgment in favor of the
State was entered, finding that Farzami violated Hawaii Revised
Statutes ("HRS") section 291C-137(a) (Supp. 2016), Mobile
Electronic Devices.   1/
On appeal, Farzami contends that (1) the deputy sheriff
who issued the citation mistook Farzami's earpiece for a mobile
device, and (2) he was "parked far enough from the driveway of
Costco[,] which makes that a private property," and, thus, HRS
section 219C-137 is inapplicable. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve Farzami's points of error as follows and affirm:

Without a transcript of the proceeding, there is no
basis to review Farzami's alleged use of an earpiece instead of a
mobile device as set forth in the citation or whether Farzami was
using an electronic device in the private parking lot of Costco
or, as set forth in the citation, at the intersection turning
right on to Dillingham Boulevard, which is a public way, street,
road, or highway to which HRS section 291C-137(a) is applicable. 
Haw. Rev. Stat. ยง 291C-137(e).  Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80
Hawai#i 225, 231, 909 P.2d 553, 559 (1995).
Furthermore, to the extent that Farzami contends that
the District Court erred because it believed the State's evidence
with regard to what the deputy sheriff saw and where Farzami was
when the deputy sheriff saw it, we are unable to provide any
relief.  "An appellate court will not pass upon the trial judge's
decisions with respect to the credibility of witnesses and the
weight of the evidence because this is the province of the trial
judge."  Porter v. Hu , 116 Hawai#i 42, 60, 169 P.3d 994, 1012
(App. 2007) (quoting State v. Eastman, 81 Hawai# i 131, 139, 913
P.2d 57, 65 (1996)).
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of
Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, filed on
December 26, 2017, in the District Court of the First Circuit,
Honolulu Division, is affirmed.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai#i, April 25, 2019.
