affirm. 
I. BACKGROUND 
 
A. Factual Background 
  
According to Quinn, his family founded Pahoa Feed and 
Fertilizer as a sole proprietorship in 2000.  Quinn explains 
that, in 2002, Brian M. Hyatt's (Hyatt) family and Quinn's 
family incorporated Pahoa Feed and Fertilizer under HQHQ, Inc., 
a Hawai‘i corporation, consisting of a 50-50 ownership between 
the two families.  
On June 20, 2008, HQHQ executed a promissory note 
(Note), promising to repay Yoso and Kikuko Kuwahara (Kuwaharas), 
in their capacity as trustee of their respective revocable 
living trusts, for a $445,000.00 loan with an interest rate of 
six percent per year.  The Note required HQHQ to pay the 
Kuwaharas $3,500.00 every month until June 6, 2015, at which time HQHQ would be required to pay the balance of the Note. 
Quinn and Hyatt each personally guaranteed HQHQ's 
obligations under the Note.  FOF 4.  The loan was secured with a 
Mortgage on a Property in Puna on the island of Hawai‘ i.  FOF 2, 
3.  The Mortgage was recorded in the Bureau of Conveyances on 
June 25, 2008. 
Kikuko Kuwahara (in her capacity as Trustee of the 
Kikuko Kuwahara Revocable Living Trust Agreement dated NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 
4 
 September 15, 1986, as amended, and as Successor Trustee of the 
Yoso Kuwahara Revocable Living Trust dated March 3, 1977, as 
amended) assigned the Note and Mortgage to Oyadomari in 2013, 
and recorded the assignment in the Bureau of Conveyances.  Per 
this assignment, Oyadomari had "all right, title and interest in 
and to" the Note and Mortgage, including the "obligation and power to discharge Mortgage through the execution and delivery 
of a release of this Mortgage." 
According to correspondence Quinn attached to his and 
HQHQ's memorandum in opposition to the commissioner's motion for 
leave to sell without an open house, Quinn and Oyadomari were 
negotiating the terms of a purchase money mortgage for the 
property in May 2015, a month before the Note became due.
2 
On June 6, 2015, the Note became due with a principal 
balance of $312,305.73 and interest accruing at a rate of six percent per year.  FOF 6, 9.  HQHQ, Quinn, and Hyatt 
(collectively Defendants) failed to pay the amount owed.  FOF 7. 
In letters dated June 24, 2015 and February 19, 2016, 
Oyadomari made demands on Defendants to pay the balance due. 
FOF 7.  Despite the demands for payment, Defendants "failed to 
pay the amounts owed under the Note."  FOF 8. 
 
2  Quinn represented to the circuit court that, around this time, the 
Hyatt and Quinn families realized " future business opportunities were best 
pursued separately as we were at an impasse regarding the direction of the 
business and did not work well as business partners."   Quinn also submitted 
to the circuit court a letter from Hyatt indicating a willingness to relinquish his family' s interest in HQHQ if certain demands were met. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 
5 
 Correspondence Quinn submitted to the circuit court 
indicated that the parties continued negotiating a new loan, but 
in June 2016, Oyadomari's attorney stated, "We have a 
foreclosure complaint that we are prepared to file but my client 
is willing to hold off on filing the complaint if a new loan can 
be closed by July 1, 2016" and set a June 17, 2016 deadline.  On June 17, 2016, Quinn responded with modifications, to which 
Oyadomari was "not agreeable[.]"  Oyadomari then proposed new 
terms that would expire at 4:30 p.m. on Friday, June 24, 2016.  
The correspondence provided by Quinn did not reflect a response. 
B. Procedural Background 
1. The Complaint 
 
On November 29, 2016, Oyadomari filed her complaint 
for foreclosure in the circuit court against Defendants.  
Oyadomari contended Defendants were in "material default under 
the terms of the Note and the Mortgage[,]" therefore she was 
"entitled to foreclose upon the Mortgage and the subject 
property and to obtain a deficiency judgment, if appropriate, 
against Defendants." 
2. Oyadomari's Motion for Summary Judgment and 
Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure 
  
On February 15, 2017, Oyadomari filed a motion for 
summary judgment and interlocutory decree of foreclosure.  In
her memorandum in support of the motion, Oyadomari stated she
was entitled to summary judgment on her foreclosure claim  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 
6 
   because she established the four material factual elements 
outlined in Bank of Honolulu v. Anderson, 3 Haw. App. 545, 550,
551, 654 P.2d 1370, 1374, 1375 (1982) (explaining that a party 
moving for summary judgment on a foreclosure claim must prove 
these material facts to prevail:  "(1) the existence of the 
Agreement, (2) the terms of the Agreement, (3) default by [the mortgagor or debtor] under the terms of the Agreement, and 
(4) the giving of" requisite notice).  
On April 19, 2017, the circuit court entered its 
"Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting 
Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and Interlocutory Decree 
of Foreclosure."  The circuit court concluded:  
 3. Plaintiff provided sufficient evidence of the 
existence and terms of the Note and Mortgage.
 
   
 4. Defendants' failure to pay the amounts owed under 
the Note in accordance with the terms of the Note constitutes a material default under the Note and Mortgage.
 
 
 5. Plaintiff gave the requisite notice to Defendants 
of their default and despite such notice,
 Defendants failed 
to pay the amounts owed to Plaintiff. 
 
 6. As a result of Defendants' material default under 
the Note and Mortgage, Plaintiff is entitled to foreclose 
upon the property secured and encumbered by the Mortgage. 
 
 
The circuit court also appointed a commissioner to conduct the 
sale and entered its judgment. 
HQHQ and Quinn did not appeal from this April 19, 2017 
order and judgment. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 
7 
  3. Oyadomari's Motion to Confirm Sale 
The foreclosure sale was held on July 17, 2017, and 
Oyadomari entered the final and highest bid of $375,100.00.  
Oyadomari then moved to confirm the sale.  Oyadomari also 
requested:  "to satisfy the purchase price by way of an offset 
of the amount of her secured debt in the event that [she] is the confirmed purchaser of the subject property"; direct the 
commissioner to convey the property via quitclaim deed to the 
confirmed purchaser; award the commissioner fees and expenses as 
determined by the circuit court; and discharge the commissioner 
once the sale was complete.  In addition, Oyadomari sought a 
writ of possession or ejectment. 
4. Quinn's Motion to Compel Oyadomari to Accept Full 
Payment 
 
On October 9, 2017, over five months after the circuit 
court granted Oyadomari's motion for summary judgment and 
interlocutory decree of foreclosure, Quinn moved to compel 
Oyadomari to accept full payment, relying on Hawai‘ i Rules of 
Civil Procedure ( 
HRCP) Rules 60(b)(2), (b)(5), and (b)(6), and 
the court's powers of equity.  Quinn requested "an order 
compelling [Oyadomari] to accept full payment for the June 20, 
2008 Promissory Note, and all other orders necessary to allow [Quinn] to close the $250,000 loan approved by First Hawaiian 
Bank." NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 
8 
 In the memorandum supporting his motion to compel 
Oyadomari to accept full payment, Quinn contended he had a 
"right to redeem" and that his "legal obligation to pay 
[Oyadomari] includes the reciprocal legal right to receive the 
benefit of the bargain."  Relying on HRCP Rules 60(b)(2), 
(b)(5), and (b)(6), Quinn maintained that when he would be able to pay Oyadomari "the full amount due under the June 20, 2008 
Promissory Note it" would "no longer [be] equitable to proceed 
with the foreclosure sale of the property."  Quinn stated he 
believed Oyadomari was trying to foreclose on the property 
because it would provide access to the main road from her 
parcel, thus making development of the land "much more 
valuable[.]"  Quinn also believed this was the same reason "why [Oyadomari] opposed being paid in full." 
 5. October 13, 2017 Order 
At the October 11, 2017 hearing, the circuit court 
considered Quinn's motion to compel Oyadomari to accept full 
payment.  Quinn argued the court had the authority to compel 
Oyadomari to accept the payment because "the law is clear as far 
as the Court's broad discretion sitting in equity to grant the 
relief" and per HRCP Rule 60(b)(5), where "it is no longer 
equitable . . . that [a] judgment" should apply prospectively, the court has authority to grant relief as requested. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 
9 
 Oyadomari opposed the motion because she did not 
believe the court had the authority to compel her to accept 
Quinn's "settlement offer[.]"  She also argued that she was 
exercising her statutorily and contractually based remedies, and 
maintained that Quinn's arguments at this hearing, instead, 
should have been made in opposition to her motion for summary judgment.  Oyadomari stated there was no authority at the time 
of this hearing, "to say that pursuant to contract law the 
defendants have the right to redeem or force" acceptance of the 
"settlement offer." 
Regarding Oyadomari's motion to confirm the sale, 
Quinn and HQHQ requested the commissioner take additional bids, 
and then requested the court modify the bidding procedure by allowing a subsequent bid to be three percent over the prior bid 
instead of the normal procedure of five percent over the prior 
bid.
3  The circuit court allowed both parties to re-bid on the 
property at the hearing.  Oyadomari entered the prevailing bid of $413,547.75. 
On October 13, 2017, the circuit court entered an 
order denying Quinn's motion to compel Oyadomari to accept full 
payment and granting Oyadomari's motion to confirm the sale. 
 
3  Under Hawai‘ i Probate Rules Rule 70(b), in a sale of real property, 
"[i]f an initial bid has been offered and accepted, a further overbid from 
any person shall be permitted at least five percent greater than the initial 
acceptable bid." NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 
10 
  6. Quinn's Motion for Reconsideration 
Quinn moved for reconsideration of the October 13, 
2017 order, again relying on HRCP Rules 60(b)(2), 60(b)(5) and 
60(b)(6).  In his motion for reconsideration, Quinn claimed 
denying his motion to compel Oyadomari to accept full payment 
and granting Oyadomari's motion to confirm the sale "without explanation is erroneous as a matter of law." 
On November 24, 2017, the circuit court denied Quinn's 
motion for reconsideration.
4  The circuit court found that the 
motion for reconsideration failed "to present any new evidence or arguments that could not have been presented prior" and noted 
a motion for reconsideration "should be more than a forum to 
express dissatisfaction with the Court's Order." 
7. The November 28, 2017 Orders and Judgment 
 
On November 28, 2017, the circuit court again granted 
Oyadomari's motion to confirm the sale.  In its findings of 
fact, the circuit court found that the tax assessed value of the 
property was $237,800.00 and Oyadomari's bid of $413,547.75 
"significantly exceeds" the property's value.  In its 
conclusions of law, the circuit court concluded Oyadomari's bid 
for the property was "fair and equitable"; the commissioner's 
fees and expenses were fair, reasonable, and necessarily 
 
4  Also in this order, the circuit court denied a motion for leave to 
file a counterclaim and crossclaim filed by Quinn on October 10, 2017. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 
11 
 incurred; and Oyadomari's requested attorney's fees and costs 
were fair, reasonable, and necessarily incurred.  The circuit 
court entered a judgment "pursuant to [HRCP Rule 54(b)] as there 
is no just reason for delay." 
That same day, the circuit court issued a writ of 
possession.  The writ stated that Oyadomari was "entitled to possession of the subject property and a writ of ejectment 
against Defendants" and commanded the sheriff to remove 
Defendants, "and all persons holding by, through or under said 
defendants." 
The circuit court also entered a second order denying 
Quinn's motion to compel Oyadomari to accept full payment. 
8. Oyadomari's Motion to Alter or Amend the Confirmation 
of Sale  
  
Oyadomari moved to alter or amend the November 28, 
2017 order granting her motion to confirm the sale.  Oyadomari 
asked the court to award her additional attorney's fees and 
costs, allow her to offset all the awarded fees and costs 
against the property's confirmed purchase price, and withhold "distribution of any excess sale proceeds pending" her 
"execution and enforcement of the Writ of Possession[.]"   
Quinn filed both a memorandum in opposition and a 
motion to strike Oyadomari's motion to alter or amend the 
November 28, 2017 order granting her motion to confirm the sale.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 
12 
   The circuit court granted Oyadomari's motion and denied Quinn's 
motion. 
HQHQ and Quinn filed a notice of appeal on 
December 28, 2017.
 
II. DISCUSSION 
HQHQ and Quinn raise two points of error, alleging 
(1) the circuit court erred in failing to grant relief from the 
interlocutory decree of foreclosure and (2) all orders entered 
after the October 13, 2017 order require reversal.  We affirm.  
A. The Circuit Court Did Not Abuse its Discretion in Denying 
Quinn's Motions for Relief 
 
In their first point of error, HQHQ and Quinn argue 
that the circuit court "committed grave error by failing to 
grant relief from the interlocutory decree of foreclosure where 
it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have 
prospective application," asserting: 
Where (1) [Oyadomari] would be paid in full, (2) Mr. Quinn 
had a commercial loan commitment from First Hawaiian Bank 
for $250,000.00 to be applied to p aying [Oyadomari] in 
full, (3) the court would hold a hearing to determine the 
full amount to be paid to [Oyadomari], and (4) a court 
ordered escrow account would ensure [Oyadomari] was paid in 
full, the trial court committed grave error by failing to 
grant relief from the interlocutory decree of foreclosure 
where it is no longer equitable that the judgment should 
have prospective application.  
 
(Formatting altered.) NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 
13 
 We again note that HQHQ and Quinn did not appeal from 
the April 19, 2017 order granting Oyadomari's motion for summary 
judgment and interlocutory decree of foreclosure or the related 
judgment and, thus, waived any appeal from that order or 
judgment.  Quinn instead attacked the order and judgment through 
his October 9, 2017 motion to compel Oyadomari to accept full payment and his November 2, 2017 motion for reconsideration, 
relying on HRCP Rules 60(b)(2), (b)(5), and (b)(6). 
On appeal, again relying on HRCP Rules 60(b)(2), 
(b)(5), and (b)(6), HQHQ and Quinn argue that "[a]ll of the 
equities establish that the interlocutory decree of foreclosure 
no longer has prospective application."  HQHQ and Quinn further 
argue that when Oyadomari "will receive full payment the result [will be] the same as . . . when a judgment is paid" thereby 
relieving her of the "obligation to pay Defendant[s] the amount 
in excess of the debt she is owed under the promissory note." 
  HRCP Rule 60(b) provides in relevant part:  
On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may 
relieve a party or a party's legal representative from a 
final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following 
reasons: 
 
. . . . 
 
(2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b);
 
 . . . . 
 
(5)
 the judgment has been satisfied, released, or 
discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has 
been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 
14 
 equitable that the judgment should have prospective 
application; or 
 (6) any other reason justifying relief from the operation 
of the judgment. 
  
(Formatting altered.)   
The circuit court's rulings on a motion based on HRCP 
Rules 60(b)(2), (b)(5), and/or (b)(6) are reviewed for abuse of 
discretion.  See Beneficial Hawaii, Inc. v. Casey, 98 Hawai‘ i 
159, 164, 45 P.3d 359, 364 (2002); Amfac, Inc. v. Waikiki 
Beachcomber Inv. Co., 74 Haw. 85, 114, 839 P.2d 10, 26 (1992) 
(explaining abuse of discretion occurs if the trial court has 
"clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or 
principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a 
party litigant"). 
"Furthermore, the burden of establishing abuse of 
discretion is on appellant, and a strong showing is required to 
establish it."  Ek v. Boggs, 102 Hawai‘ i 289, 294-95, 75 P.3d 
1180, 1185-86 (2003) (citation, internal quotation marks, and 
brackets omitted). 
 1. HRCP Rule 60(b)(2) 
First, HRCP Rule 60(b)(2) may provide relief if the 
evidence was (1) "previously undiscovered even though due 
diligence was exercised;" (2) "admissible and credible;" and 
(3) "of such material and controlling nature as will probably 
change the outcome and not merely cumulative or [t]ending only  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 
15 
 to impeach or contradict a witness."  Omerod v. Heirs of 
Kaheananui, 116 Hawai‘ i 239, 277, 172 P.3d 983, 1021 (2007) 
(citation and emphasis omitted). 
HQHQ and Quinn rely on "a commercial loan commitment 
from First Hawaiian Bank for $250,000.00 to be applied to paying 
[Oyadomari] in full," which was dated October 5, 2017. 
  Unchallenged findings show that (1) "[p]ursuant to the 
terms of the Note, all amounts owed under the Note were due and 
payable on June 6, 2015"; (2) as of June 6, 2015, HQHQ and Quinn owed $312,305.73; (3) HQHQ and Quinn failed to pay the amount 
owed by June 6, 2015; and (4) Oyadomari filed a complaint to 
foreclose on November 29, 2016.  The record shows that the 
circuit court granted Oyadomari's motion for summary judgment 
and interlocutory decree of foreclosure, and entered its 
judgment, on April 19, 2017. 
Dated October 5, 2017, the First Hawaiian Bank loan 
commitment was created over two years after the Note was due and, thus, was not previously undiscovered evidence.  Further, 
the loan commitment was for $250,000.00 while the amount due on 
June 6, 2015 was $312,305.73.
5  Thus, nothing in the First 
Hawaiian Bank loan commitment changes the default on the Note or is "of such material and controlling nature as will probably 
 
5  Quinn asserted that "[w]ith the $250,000 First Hawaiian Bank loan and 
his additional liquid assets [he] can pay" the full amount owed under the 
Note.  Quinn, however, did not elaborate on his additional liquid assets. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 
16 
   change the outcome."  See generally, Omerod, 116 Hawai‘ i  at 277, 
172 P.3d at 1021. 
 2. HRCP Rule 60(b)(5) 
Next, "HRCP Rule 60(b)(5) is based on the historic 
power of a court of equity to modify its decree in the light of 
changed circumstances."  In re Hawaiian Elec. Co., 149 Hawai‘ i 
343, 362, 489 P.3d 1255, 1274 (2021) (citation omitted).  HRCP 
Rule 60(b)(5) "is not a substitute for an appeal" but "refers to 
'some change in conditions that makes continued enforcement 
inequitable.'"  Id.  "The burden is on the movant to 
'demonstrate extraordinary circumstances justifying relief.'"  Id. 
The only circumstance that changed after the default 
of the Note was the First Hawaiian Bank loan commitment for $250,000.00.  But that loan commitment was offered over two 
years after the Note was due, over ten months after the 
complaint to foreclose was filed, over five months after the 
court granted Oyadomari's motion for summary judgment and 
interlocutory decree of foreclosure, and did not cover the amount owed on the Note.  Untimely and insufficient alternative 
financing was not an extraordinary circumstance justifying 
relief from the interlocutory decree of foreclosure and the 
related judgment. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 
17 
  3. HRCP Rule 60(b)(6)  
Finally, under HRCP Rule 60(b)(6), "the movant must 
show that (1) the motion is based on some reason other than 
those specifically stated in clauses 60(b)(1) through (5); 
(2) the reason urged is such as to justify the relief; and 
(3) the motion is made within a reasonable time."  Cvitanovich-
Dubie v. Dubie, 125 Hawai‘ i 128, 144, 254 P.3d 439, 455 (2011) 
(citation and emphasis omitted).  "A party seeking relief under HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) after the time of appeal has run must establish the existence of 'extraordinary circumstances' that 
prevented or rendered him unable to prosecute an appeal."  
Hawai‘i Hous. Auth. v. Uyehara, 77 Hawai‘ i 144, 148-49, 883 P.2d 
65, 69-70 (1994) (citation omitted). 
Again, the unchallenged findings show HQHQ and Quinn 
failed to pay the $312,305.73 owed by June 6, 2015, and they did 
not appeal the April 19, 2017 order granting the motion for 
summary judgment and interlocutory decree of foreclosure, and 
judgment.  As they do in their HRCP Rules 60(b)(2) and (b)(5) 
arguments, HQHQ and Quinn rely on the First Hawaiian Bank loan commitment to say Quinn can now afford to pay off the loan.  
However, obtaining financing over two years after the default, 
over ten months after the complaint to foreclose was filed, and 
over five months after the order granting summary judgment and 
interlocutory decree of foreclosure, did not establish NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 
18 
 extraordinary circumstances that rendered HQHQ and Quinn unable 
to prosecute an appeal and did not justify relief from the 
interlocutory decree of foreclosure and related judgment. 
Based on the record before us, HQHQ and Quinn did not 
meet their burden of showing there was newly discovered 
evidence, the judgment was no longer equitable, or any other reason justifying relief.  See generally, HRCP Rule 60(b); Ek v. 
Boggs, 102 Hawai‘ i at 294-95, 75 P.3d at 1185-86.  Thus, we 
cannot say that the circuit court abused its discretion in its October 13, 2017 order by, as HQHQ and Quinn phrase the issue, 
"failing to grant relief from the interlocutory decree of 
foreclosure" based on HRCP Rule 60(b).  (Formatting altered.) 
B. Challenge to Orders Subsequent to the October 13, 2017 
Order is Waived  
   
 
 In their second point of error, HQHQ and Quinn contend 
"[w]here the trial court committed grave error by entering the 
October 13, 2017 [Order], the reversal of the October 13, 2017 
Order requires reversal of all subsequent Orders, Findings of 
Fact, Conclusions of Law and decisions[.]" (Formatting altered.)   
HQHQ and Quinn's entire argument consists of the following two 
sentences: 
"This point is procedural and straight forward.  
All of the court's actions after the October 13, 2017 Order must be set aside as they are based on 
an order that no longer exists."   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 Hawai‘i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 
Rule 28(b)(7) requires an argument to "contain[] the contentions 
of the appellant on the points presented and the reasons 
therefor, with citations to the authorities, statutes and parts 
of the record relied on. . . .  Points not argued may be deemed 
waived."  In addition, "[a]n appellate court need not address 
matters as to which the appellant has failed to present a 
discernible argument."  Int'l Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. Carbonel, 93 
Hawai‘i 464, 473, 5 P.3d 454, 463 (2000). 
  HQHQ and Quinn provide no analysis, and cite no legal authority to support this point of error.  In short, HQHQ and 
Quinn did not comply with HRAP Rule 28(b)(7) and did not present a discernible argument.  We consider this argument waived. 
  
In any event, as explained above, the circuit court 
did not err in entering its October 13, 2017 order.  Therefore, HQHQ and Quinn's second point of error also lacks merit.
