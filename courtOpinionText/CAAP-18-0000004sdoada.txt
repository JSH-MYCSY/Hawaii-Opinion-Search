v.
CHELSEA L. DAUER, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
HONOLULU DIVISION
(CASE NO. 1DTA-17-00865)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Chan, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Chelsea L. Dauer (Dauer) appeals
from a Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment
(Judgment), entered on December 6, 2017, by the District Court of
the First Circuit, Honolulu Division (district court ).  The
district court convicted Dauer of one count of Operating a
Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant, in violation of
Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1) (2007 and Supp.
2018).21
1  The Honorable Melanie M. May presided.  
2  HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) (2007 & Supp. 2018) provides:
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle
under the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates
or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle:

On appeal, Dauer argues the district court wrongly
concluded (1) the roadblock at which she was stopped complied
with the Hawaii Administrative Rules (HAR ), where Plaintiff-
Appellee State of Hawai# i (State) failed to demonstrate the
Honolulu Police Department (HPD ) issued a news release, notifying
the public "of the fact and purpose of the roadblock," in
compliance with the Rules of the Chief of Police ( RCP) Rule 18-
3(d); and (2) the evidence was sufficient to convict her where
the district court failed to find her normal mental faculties
were impaired.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve Dauer's points of error as follows.
A. Compliance with RCP Rule 18-3(d)
RCP Rule 18-3(d) provides:
The following safety precautions shall be provided at every
roadblock.
. . . . 
(d)
 Advance warning of the fact of the roadblock,
either by reflective sign, flares, or other alternative
methods.  Advance warning of the fact and purpose of the
roadblocks by proper news release[.] 
Dauer argues the roadblock was invalid where the State
failed to prove compliance with RCP Rule 18.  This point lacks
merit.  Even if the HPD failed to issue a news release to warn
the public about potential future roadblocks, a failure to comply
scrupulously with internal police procedures that do not fall
within the definition of a "rule" under HRS § 91-1,  "shall not3
2(...continued)
(1)While under the influence of alcohol in an
amount sufficient to impair the person's normal
mental faculties or ability to care for the
person and guard against casualty[.]
3  HRS § 91-1 (2012 & Supp. 2018) defines "rule" as follows:
"Rule" means each agency statement of general or
particular applicability and future effect that implements,
interprets, or prescribes law or policy, or describes the

invalidate a roadblock that otherwise meets the minimum statutory 
criteria[.]"  State v. Claunch, 111 Hawai#i 59, 65, 137 P.3d 373,
379 (App. 2006).  
Dauer does not argue the State failed to comply with
HRS § 291E-20 ("Minimum standards for roadblock procedures."). 
RCP Rule 18-3(d) falls within an exception to HRS § 91-1's
definition of "rule" for "regulations concerning only the
internal management of an agency and not affecting private rights
of or procedures available to the public[.]"  RCP Rule 18-3(d)
"does not command members of the public to do anything or
prohibit them from doing anything, nor does it declare the rights
of members of the public or affect a procedure available to
members of the public[,]" see Kawashima v. State, 140 Hawai#i
139, 152, 398 P.3d 728, 741 (2017), and is directed only at
police officers, see In re Doe, 9 Haw. App. 406, 412, 844 P.2d
679, 682 (1992), and aimed at "prescribing and controlling the
police officer's activities in order to minimize the intrusion on
the driver's rights[,]" see State v. Fedak, 9 Haw. App. 98, 101,
825 P.2d 1068, 1070 (1992), superseded by statute as stated in
Claunch, 111 Hawai# i at 64, 137 P.3d at 378. 
Dauer argues the RCP were adopted pursuant to HRS
Chapter 91, and, therefore, must be treated as requirements for a
legally valid roadblock according to Act 183's legislative
history providing that "rules adopted pursuant to Chapter 91,
[HRS], after the public review and hearing process provided for
by that chapter, . . . may fairly be treated as requirements for
a legally valid roadblock."  Claunch, 111 Hawai# i at 65-66, 137
P.3d at 379-80.  However, Dauer provides no evidence or authority
to support her assertion that the RCP were adopted pursuant to 
3(...continued)
organization, procedure, or practice requirements of any
agency.  The term does not include regulations concerning
only the internal management of an agency and not affecting
private rights of or procedures available to the public, nor
does the term include declaratory rulings issued pursuant to
section 91-8, nor intra-agency memoranda.

Chapter 91 or subjected to the public review and hearing process
provided for by that chapter, and we find none.  
Further, we note the HPD's failure to adequately notify
the public of the roadblock would have posed no significant risk
that Dauer's reasonable expectation of privacy would "be subject
to the discretion of the official in the field."  Fedak, 9 Haw.
App. at 102, 825 P.2d at 1071 (brackets, internal quotation marks
and citation omitted).  See State v. Birnbaum, No. CAAP-15-
0000518, 2016 WL 6196738, at *1, *4-5 ( Hawai#i App. Oct. 24,
2016) (mem. op), cert. denied, No. SCWC-15-0000518, 2017 WL
445492 (Feb. 2, 2017); State v. Heapy, 113 Hawai#i 283, 301-02,
151 P.3d 764, 782-83 (2007).  There is no evidence the roadblock
was set up to target Dauer or that the stop was otherwise
unreasonable.  See State v. Penalver, No. CAAP-17-0000772, 2019
WL 948464 ( Hawai#i App. Feb. 27, 2019) (SDO) (citing Birnbaum,
2016 WL 6196738 at *5).
B. Sufficiency of the Evidence
Dauer argues the evidence was insufficient to support
the conviction where the district court failed to find her normal
mental faculties were impaired.  However, it appears the district
court made this finding, albeit in an abbreviated fashion, when
it orally ruled "the State has been able to establish
impairment."  See HRS § 291E-61(a)(1).  Regardless, even if the
district court had not found Dauer's normal mental faculties were
impaired, the test on appeal is whether, viewing the evidence in
the light most favorable to the prosecution, and deferring to the
district court's right to determine credibility, weigh the
evidence, and draw reasonable inferences from the evidence
adduced, State v. Kam, 134 Hawai# i 280, 287, 339 P.3d 1081, 1088
(App. 2014), there was substantial evidence to support the
conclusion of the trier of fact.  
At trial, Sergeant James Rahe ( Sergeant Rahe) testified
that although the roadblock area was sufficiently illuminated and
marked by signs and flares, Dauer's vehicle approached at a high 
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
rate of speed, and Sergeant Rahe was compelled to alert the other
officers and put his flashlight in strobe mode as a signal to the
vehicle to stop.  The vehicle suddenly slowed and braked hard. 
On the way to the designated area, it ran over a cone it could
have avoided. 
Officer Jang Hoon Cho (Officer Cho) testified that
while talking with Dauer, who was in the vehicle's driver's seat,
he noticed she emitted an odor of alcohol and had glassy, watery
eyes.  Officer Cho conducted the Standardized Field Sobriety
Tests (SFST ).  Dauer stated she understood all of the SFST
instructions. 
Contrary to Officer Cho's instructions, Dauer made the
following mistakes while performing the SFST.  While performing
the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test, she moved her head twice
while following the stimulus despite being previously instructed
to keep her head still and to move her eyes only.  During the
instructional phase of the walk-and-turn test, she stood with her
feet side by side as opposed to standing with her left and right
feet heel-to-toe as instructed; on the first set of nine steps of
the test, she missed one or more heel-to-toe connections by at
least one to two inches, raised her left arm at least six inches
from her side, and appeared to stumble and stepped off the line
on the ninth step; and on the second set of nine steps, she
missed one or more heel-to-toe connections by at least one to two
inches.  On the first thirty-second phase of the one-leg-stand
test, she raised her arm away from her body at least six to eight
inches to balance herself, swayed at least one to two inches from
side to side the entire time, and put her foot down before the
time was up. 
Based on Dauer's performance on the SFST, Officer Cho
believed Dauer was so impaired she was unable to safely operate
her vehicle. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of
Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, entered on
