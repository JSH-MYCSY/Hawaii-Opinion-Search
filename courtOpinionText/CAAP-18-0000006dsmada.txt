NO. CAAP-18-0000006
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
IN THE MATTER OF
THE MAMERTO V. AND GUADALOPE C. FERMIN
REVOCABLE TRUST DATED JULY 15, 1994 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(TRUST NO. 12-1-0105)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
Upon review of the record, it appears that, in the
absence of a judgment that satisfies the requirements of Hawaii
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (2016) and Rule 34 of the
Hawai#i Probate Rules (HPR), we lack appellate jurisdiction over
Co-Trustee/Appellant Elizabeth L. Sur's (Sur) appeal from the
Honorable R. Mark Browning's December 5, 2017 interlocutory order
denying Sur's August 2, 2017 motion to set aside a May 19, 2017
interlocutory order granting Co-Trustee/Appellant Florencio Roy
Fermin's (Florencio Fermin) August 1, 2016 petition to confirm
the sale of real property in the Probate Court's trust
proceedings in T. No. 12-1-0105.  As explained below, if the
Probate Court is not yet ready to finally close Trust 
No. 12-1-0105 by way of a final judgment pursuant to HPR 
Rule 34(c), then an interlocutory order that resolves a petition
becomes eligible for appellate review only if the Probate Court NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
exercises its discretion to reduce the interlocutory order to an
HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified judgment pursuant to HPR Rule 34(a).
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals from a Probate
Court's final judgments, orders, or decrees.  Appeals under HRS
§ 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules
of court."  HRS § 641-1(c).  The Supreme Court of Hawai #i has
promulgated HPR Rule 34 for, among other things, trust
proceedings (see  HPR Rule 1), which generally require the entry
of a judgment for the purpose of perfecting an aggrieved party's
right to appellate review:
RULE 34. ENTRY OF JUDGMENT, INTERLOCUTORY ORDERS, APPEALS
(a) Entry of Judgment.  All formal testacy orders,
orders of intestacy and determination of heirs, orders
establishing conservatorship and/or guardianship, and orders
establishing protective arrangements shall be reduced to
judgment and the judgment shall be filed with the clerk of
the court.  Such judgments shall be final and immediately
appealable as provided by statute.  Any other order that
fully addresses all claims raised in a petition to which it
relates, but that does not finally end the proceeding, may
be certified for appeal in the manner provided by Rule 54(b)
of the Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure.
(b) Interlocutory Orders.  In order to appeal from any
other order prior to the conclusion of the proceeding, the
order must be certified for appeal in accordance with
Section 641-1(b) of the Hawai'i Revised Statutes.
(c) Final Judgment Closing Proceeding.  At the
conclusion of the proceeding, a final judgment closing the
proceeding shall be entered and filed with the clerk of the
court, at which time all prior uncertified interlocutory
orders shall become immediately appealable.
(d) Appeals.  Final judgments as to all claims and
parties, certified judgments, certified orders, and other
orders appealable as provided by law may be appealed
pursuant to the Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure
applicable to civil actions.
HPR Rule 34 (emphases added).  In cases where HPR Rule 34
applies, the Supreme Court of Hawai #i has consistently held that
when "final judgment terminating the proceeding has not been
entered, and these [appealed] orders were not certified for
appeal[,] . . . those orders are not before us."  In re
Guardianship of Carlsmith, 113 Hawai #i 211, 223, 151 P.3d 692,
704 (2006).  On February 16, 2018, the Probate Court clerk filed
the record on appeal for appellate court case number 
CAAP-18-0000006, which does not contain an appealable final
judgment under HRS § 641-1(a) and HPR Rule 34(c), or an HRCP 
Rule 54(b)-certified judgment pursuant to HPR Rule 34(a).  
-2-NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Granted, under other circumstances, the Supreme Court
of Hawai# i has held that, when the record on appeal indicates
that all claims against all parties have been resolved and the
only thing lacking for the perfection of an aggrieved party's
right to appeal is the entry of a final judgment, the Hawai #i
Intermediate Court of Appeals should invoke HRS § 602-57(3)
(2016), and temporarily remand the case to the trial court with
instructions to enter the final judgment.  Waikiki v. Ho# omaka
Village Association of Apartment Owners, 140 Hawai #i 197, 204,
398 P.3d 786, 793 (2017).  However, the instant case is
distinguishable from the circumstances in Waikiki , because the
record in the instant case does not clearly indicate that the
omission of an HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified judgment is a mere
oversight on the part of the Probate Court in these ongoing trust
proceedings that have not yet concluded.  
Indeed, the omission of an appealable judgment may well
be intentional.  "Rule 54(b) does not prescribe any procedure for
obtaining a certificate.  Although the normal procedure is to
request such certification by motion, a trial court may consider
the matter sua sponte in an appropriate case.  See  10 Wright,
Miller & Kane § 2660."  Arimizu v. Fin. Sec. Ins. Co., 5 Haw.
App. 106, 112, 679 P.2d 627, 633 (1984).  In the absence of a
motion for HRCP Rule 54(b) certification, it is not obvious from
the record whether the parties and/or the Probate Court ever
intended to reduce any dispositive interlocutory order to a
separate HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified judgment pursuant to HPR
Rule 34(a).  In Florencio Fermin's February 26, 2018 statement
contesting jurisdiction, Florencio Fermin asserts that the
Probate Court intentionally refrained from reducing the May 19,
2017 order granting Florencio Fermin's August 1, 2016 petition to
confirm the sale of real property to a separate HRCP Rule 54(b)-
certified judgment pursuant to HPR Rule 34(a) because the Probate
Court wanted to ensure that it would retain jurisdiction over
this case in the event that the sale of the real property did not
take place, which, in turn, would necessitate further Probate
-3-NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Court proceedings.  In Sur's February 26, 2018 statement of
jurisdiction, Sur does not indicate that the Probate Court or any
party intended for the Probate Court to reduce its dispositive
ruling to a separate HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified judgment pursuant
to HPR Rule 34(a).  In light of the fact that the Probate Court
appears to have refrained from exercising its discretion to
certify its ruling for an appeal pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b), we
will not interfere with the Probate Court's discretion in this
ongoing trust proceeding.  Absent an appealable final judgment,
we lack appellate jurisdiction, and Sur's appeal is premature.
 Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case
number CAAP-18-0000006 is dismissed for lack of appellate
jurisdiction.
