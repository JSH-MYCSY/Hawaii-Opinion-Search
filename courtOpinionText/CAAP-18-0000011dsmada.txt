APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 13-1-0868) 
ORDER GRANTING FEBRUARY 12, 2019 MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL
(Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Chan, JJ.) 
Upon review of (1) the February 12, 2019 motion by 
Plaintiff-Appellee Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, a 
National Banking Corporation, as Trustee for New Century Home Equity Loan Trust, Series 2005-D, Asset Backed Pass-Through Certificates (Deutsche Bank) to dismiss appellate court case number CAAP-18-0000011 as moot, (2) the lack of any response by Defendant-Appellant Maria Elena Guzik (Guzik) to Deutsche Bank's February 12, 2019 motion, and (3) the record, it appears that NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Guzik's appeal from the Honorable Jeannette H. Castagnetti's 
February 20, 2018 judgment on an order confirming the sale of foreclosed property is moot. 
A case is moot if it has lost its character as a present,
live controversy of the kind that must exist if courts areto avoid advisory opinions on abstract propositions of law.The rule is one of the prudential rules of judicial self-governance founded in concern about the proper - andproperly limited - role of the courts in a democraticsociety. We have said the suit must remain alive throughoutthe course of litigation to the moment of final appellatedisposition to escape the mootness bar. . . . Simply put, acase is moot if the reviewing court can no longer granteffective relief. 
Kaho# ohanohano v. State, 114 Hawai# i 302, 332, 162 P.3d 696, 726 
(2007) (citations, internal quotation marks, and brackets 
omitted; emphasis added). The record shows that Guzik failed to post a supersedeas bond or otherwise obtain a stay pending this appeal, and Deutsche Bank has submitted a declaration by third parties Thao T. Lam and Tammy Lam (the Lams) and a certified copy of a deed that show the Lams lawfully purchased and received ownership of the foreclosed property in good faith by way of a commissioner's deed that they recorded on September 11, 2018. Guzik has not refuted any of Deutsche Bank's arguments or submissions regarding mootness. 
Deutsche Bank cites a recent 
opinion by the Supreme Court of Hawai# i in support of its 
argument that the instant appeal is moot: 
This case requires us to determine whether an appeal
of an order confirming sale is moot when the appellant does
not post a supersedeas bond to obtain a stay of theproceedings prior to the sale of the property to a bona fidepurchaser. We answer this question in the affirmative. In doing so, we adopt the general rule stated by theIntermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) in City Bank v. SajeVentures II that "the right of a good faith purchaser toreceive property acquired at a judicial sale cannot beaffected by the reversal of an order ratifying the salewhere a supersedeas bond has not been filed." 7 Haw. App.130, 133, 748 P.2d 812, 814 (1988) (internal brackets,quotation marks, and citation omitted). 
Bank of New York Mellon v. R. Onaga, Inc., 140 Hawai# i 358, 360, 
400 P.3d 559, 561 (2017). 
A party who wishes to stay an order confirming a
foreclosure sale pending appeal must post a supersedeas bondor otherwise obtain a stay pursuant to HRCP Rule 62 or HRAPRule 8. If a stay is not obtained and the property is soldto a bona fide purchaser, the appeal should be dismissed as

moot because no effective relief can be granted. In the 
instant case, Onaga failed to post a supersedeas bond orotherwise obtain a stay, and the Ferraras lawfully purchasedthe Property in good faith. 
Id. at 370, 400 P.3d at 571 (emphasis added). Under the 
circumstances of the instant case, the holding in Bank of New York Mellon requires us to dismiss Guzik's appeal as moot. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Deutsche Bank's 
February 12, 2019 motion is granted, and we dismiss appellate court case number CAAP-18-0000011 as moot.
