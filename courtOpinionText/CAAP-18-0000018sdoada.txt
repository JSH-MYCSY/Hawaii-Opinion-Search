APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
(5PC-11-1-000023) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Chan, JJ.) 
Plaintiff-Appellant State of Hawai# i (State) appeals in 
CAAP-18-0000018 from the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit's 
(Circuit Court) (1) December 14, 2017 "Order Granting in Part and 
Denying in Part State's Motion to Determine Voluntariness of 
Defendant Vicente Kotekapika Hilario's [(Hilario)] Statements in 
Prior Testimony;" (2) December 28, 2017 "Order Denying State's 
Motion to Determine Voluntariness of [Hilario's] Statements in 
Prior Testimony;" and (3) January 11, 2018 "Order Denying State's 
Motion for Court to Reconsider Its Ruling as to State's Motion to 
Determine Voluntariness of [Hilario's] Statements in Prior 
Testimony;" and in CAAP-18-0000066, the State appeals from the 
January 31, 2018 "Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law 
Concerning the December 14, 2017 Order Granting in Part and 
Denying in Part State's Motion to Determine the Voluntariness of 
[Hilario's] Statements in Prior Testimony & the December 28, 2017 
Order Denying State's Motion to Determine Voluntariness of 
[Hilario's] Statements in Prior Testimony" (collectively, Prior NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Testimony Orders).  On April 2, 2018, this court ordered CAAP-
18-0000018 and CAAP-18-0000066 be consolidated under CAAP-18-
0000018. 1
After reviewing the record on appeal and the relevant 
legal authorities, and giving due consideration to the issues 
raised and the arguments advanced by the parties, we vacate the 
Prior Testimony Orders and remand for further proceedings. 
I. 
In 2013, Hilario was tried and convicted of Murder in 
the First Degree in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 
§ 707-701(1)(c) (2014); Bribery of a Witness in violation of HRS 
§ 710-1070(1)(a/b/c) (2014); Retaliation Against a Witness in 
violation of HRS § 710-1072.2 (2014); and Intimidating a Witness 
in violation of HRS § 710-1071(1)(a/b/c) (2014). See State v. 
Hilario, 137 Hawai# i 298, 369 P.2d 881, No. CAAP-13-0003039, 2016 
WL 1092608, at *1 (App. Mar. 28, 2016) (mem.). During this first trial, the Circuit Court administered Tachibana
  warnings four 
times, and, against the advice of Hilario's counsel, Hilario testified. 2
On appeal, this court held that Hawai# i Rules of Penal 
Procedure (HRPP) Rule 48 had been violated. Hilario, 137 Hawai# i
 
298, 369 P.3d 881, No. CAAP-13-0003039, 2016 WL 1092608 (App. Mar. 28, 2016) (mem.). The Hawai# i Supreme Court disagreed and 
remanded for review of Hilario's other points on appeal. State v. Hilario, No. SCWC-13-0003039, 2016 WL 4272904 (Aug. 12, 2016) 
(mem.). We remanded for a new trial for trial error unrelated to 
the voluntariness of his testimony. State v. Hilario, 139 
Hawai# i 546, 394 P.3d 776 (App. 2017). 
On remand to the Circuit Court, the State filed a 
Motion to Determine Voluntariness of Statements in Prior 
Testimony, seeking to use as evidence Hilario's testimony from 
his first trial in its case-in-chief. The Circuit Court held 
1 The Honorable Randal G.B. Valenciano presided. 
2 Tachibana v. State, 79 Hawai #i 226, 900 P.2d 1293 (1995). 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that Hilario's testimony from the first trial was voluntary, but 
that the State could only use it for impeachment purposes during 
cross-examination of Hilario. The State timely appeals from the 
Prior Testimony Orders. 
II. 
In the current appeal, the State contends that the 
Circuit Court erred by preventing it from presenting in the 
State's case-in-chief in the retrial testimony given by Hilario 
in his first trial because this prior testimony was given by 
Hilario after having been properly informed of his constitutional 
rights and duly found by the Circuit Court to have been 
voluntarily given.3 
In ruling on the State's motion to determine 
voluntariness, the Circuit Court concluded, as the sole basis of 
its decision, that use of the prior testimony by the State in its 
case-in-chief would violate Hilario's right against self-
incrimination under the Hawai# i Constitution because Hilario was 
not advised, prior to giving the prior testimony, that it could be used by the State in subsequent trials. We disagree. 
In Domingo v. State, 76 Hawai
#i 237, 243-44, 873 P.2d 
775, 781-82 (1994), Domingo challenged, in his post-conviction 
relief petition, that his right against self-incrimination was 
violated when his testimony given in his first trial, was 
introduced in his second trial. The supreme court held, 
The right against self-incrimination prohibits the use
at trial of statements made by a defendant that were
obtained in violation of the constitutional guarantee that"[n]o person shall . . . be compelled in any criminal caseto be a witness against oneself." Haw. Const. art. I, § 10 
3 Hilario contends that we lack jurisdiction under HRS § 641-13 to
review the Circuit Court's orders because the orders are evidentiary in naturerather than disposition of a true motion to suppress. HRS § 641-13(7) (2016)
allows the State to appeal, inter alia , "[f]rom a pretrial order granting a
motion for the suppression of evidence." However, "a circuit court's decision
on a motion to determine voluntariness is the functional equivalent of adetermination on a motion to suppress statements." State v. Jackson, 130
Hawai #i 346, 310 P.3d 1047, No. 29842, 2010 WL 1679575, at *2 (App. Apr. 21,
2010) (mem.) (citing State v. Naititi, 104 Hawai #i 224, 234, 87 P.3d 893, 903
(2004)). Here, the Circuit Court has in effect suppressed the use ofHilario's testimony from the first trial if Hilario decides not to testify inthe retrial. 
3   
 Here, Hilario did not challenge the voluntariness of 
his prior testimony, nor did he argue that it was compelled by 
the use of confessions illegally obtained by the prosecution. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(1978); U.S. Const. amend. V; State v. Kelekolio, 74 Haw.
479, 501-02, 849 P.2d 58, 69 (1993). This prohibitionextends to statements made by a defendant in a criminaltrial if the "trial testimony was in fact impelled by theprosecution's wrongful use of . . . illegally obtainedconfessions." Harrison v. United States, 392 U.S. 219, 224,
88 S.Ct. 2008, 2011, 20 L.Ed.2d 1047 (1968). Where the 
reversal of the original criminal trial was not based on the 
use of illegally obtained confessions in the prosecution's case-in-chief, however, the right against self-incrimination does not prevent the prosecution from introducing the defendant's testimony into evidence on retrial.  See Turner 
v. State, 98 Nev. 103, 641 P.2d 1062 (1982); Arizona ex rel
LaSota v. Corcoran, 119 Ariz. 573, 583 P.2d 229 (1978). 
Id. (emphasis added).4 
Subsequent to this decision, as well as the decision in 
Tachibana, this court held that the introduction of prior 
testimony by the defendant during retrial did not violate his 
right against self-incrimination. State v. Brooks, 121 Hawai# i 
259, 218 P.3d 386, No. 29175, 2009 WL 3350204 at *3 (App. Oct. 19, 2009) (mem.). We specifically noted that the defendant 
provided, and the court could find, no authority supporting his 
argument that the trial court was required to advise him that his 
testimony in the first trial could be used against him in a 
subsequent trial. Id. 
4 In Harrison, the United States Supreme Court expressed that: 
In this case we need not and do not question the general
evidentiary rule that a defendant's testimony at a formertrial is admissible in evidence against him in laterproceedings. 
A defendant who chooses to testify waives his
privilege against compulsory self-incrimination with respectto the testimony he gives, and that waiver is no lesseffective or complete because the defendant may have beenmotivated to take the witness stand in the first place onlyby reason of the strength of the lawful evidence adducedagainst him. 
392 U.S. at 222 (footnote omitted). In Harrison, however, the U.S. SupremeCourt held that the defendant testified in his first trial after the prosecution had improperly introduced into evidence three confessions that hadbeen wrongly obtained. Because the prosecution failed to show that itsillegal action did not induce the defendant's testimony in the first trial,the court held defendant's testimony from the first trial should not have beenallowed in the subsequent trial.

Therefore, his right to remain silent would not be violated by 
use of the prior testimony in his retrial. 
III. 
Therefore, the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit's 
(1) December 14, 2017 "Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part 
State's Motion to Determine Voluntariness of [Hilario's] 
Statements in Prior Testimony;" (2) December 28, 2017 "Order 
Denying State's Motion to Determine Voluntariness of [Hilario's] 
Statements in Prior Testimony;" (3) January 11, 2018 "Order 
Denying State's Motion for Court to Reconsider Its Ruling as to 
State's Motion to Determine Voluntariness of [Hilario's] 
Statements in Prior Testimony;" and (4) the January 31, 2018 
"Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law Concerning the 
December 14, 2017 Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part 
State's Motion to Determine the Voluntariness of [Hilario's] 
Statements in Prior Testimony & the December 28, 2017 Order 
Denying State's Motion to Determine Voluntariness of [Hilario's] 
Statements in Prior Testimony" are vacated and this case is 
remanded for further proceedings consistent with this summary 
disposition order.
