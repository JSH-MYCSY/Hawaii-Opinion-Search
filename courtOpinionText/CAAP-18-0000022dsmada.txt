APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 15-1-0224(3))
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
jurisdiction over this appeal by Defendant-Appellant Herma B.
 
Medina Reyna (Appellant), pro se, because her January 12, 2018
 
notice of appeal from the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit's
 
July 20, 2017 Judgment1 is untimely under Rule 4(a)(3) of the
 
Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP). 
The July 20, 2017 Judgment is immediately appealable,
 
pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes § 667-51(a)(1). 
Appellant extended the thirty-day time limit under HRAP
 
Rule 4(a)(1) for filing a notice of appeal from the July 20, 2017
 
1/ The Honorable Joseph E. Cardoza entered the Judgment.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Judgment when she timely filed her July 26, 2017 "[Appellant's]
 
Non-Hearing Motion for Reconsideration of the Order Granting
 Plaintiff, PNC Bank, N.A.'s Motion for Summary Judgment." 
Pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(3), Appellant had thirty
 
days after entry of the circuit court's December 4, 2017 order
 denying the July 26, 2017 motion for reconsideration, to file a
 notice of appeal. Thirty days after the circuit court issued its
 December 4, 2017 order was January 3, 2018. Appellant did not
 file her notice of appeal until January 12, 2018. Therefore, the
 notice of appeal was untimely, under HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). 
The failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a
 
civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot
 waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise
 of judicial discretion. Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727
 
P.2d 1127, 1129 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or
 justice is authorized to change the jurisdictional requirements
 contained in Rule 4 of these rules."); HRAP Rule 26(e) ("The
 reviewing court for good cause shown may relieve a party from a
 default occasioned by any failure to comply with these rules,
 except the failure to give timely notice of appeal."). 
Therefore, this court lacks jurisdiction over the appeal. 
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellate 
No. CAAP-18-00000022 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
