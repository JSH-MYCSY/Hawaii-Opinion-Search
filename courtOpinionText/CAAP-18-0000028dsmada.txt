v.
 
JOHN APELE KALUAU, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 3DTA-17-02844)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL
 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record here and in State v. Kaluau,
 
No. 3DTA-17-02844, it appears that: 
(1) On January 16, 2018, Defendant-Appellant John Apele
 
Kaluau (Kaluau), pro se, filed the notice of appeal, which
 
created appeal number CAAP-18-0000028;
 
(2) Kaluau failed to pay the appellate filing and 
docketing fees with the notice of appeal, as required by Hawai' i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 3(a); 
(3) On May 2, 2018, the appellate clerk entered a
 
default of the record on appeal, informing Kaluau that the time
 to docket the appeal expired on March 19, 2018, he had not paid
 the filing fee or obtained an order allowing him to proceed on
 appeal in forma pauperis, the matter would be brought to the
 court's attention on May 14, 2018, for action that may include
 dismissal of the appeal, and he could seek relief from default by
 motion. The appellate clerk mailed the default notice to the
 address listed in the notice of appeal, and the default notice
 has not been returned;

(4) Kaluau took no further action in this appeal; and
 
(5) An appeal may be dismissed where the record on
 
appeal has not been prepared because the appellant failed to pay 
the required fees or obtain an order allowing the appellant to
 proceed in forma pauperis. HRAP Rule 11(b)(2), (c)(2).
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed.
