APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 14-1-2325)
ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
Upon consideration of Defendants-Appellants Frelyn
Cesar Santella Siruno and Agnes Sonido Siruno's letter filed on
January 29, 2019, which the court construes as a motion for
reconsideration of the Summary Disposition Order filed on January
16, 2019, the papers in support and the record and files herein,NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
it appears that: (1) the Sirunos' motion for reconsideration is
not timely because under Rule 40 of the Hawai #i Rules of
Appellate Procedure, the motion for reconsideration must have
been filed within 10 days of the Summary Disposition Order; and
(2) the Sirunos' letter does not assert points of law or fact
that have been overlooked by the court to support reconsideration
of the Summary Disposition Order.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that said motion is
denied.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, February 4, 2019.
