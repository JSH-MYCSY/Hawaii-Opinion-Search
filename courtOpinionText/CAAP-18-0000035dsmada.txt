NO. CAAP-18-0000035
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI #I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
PHILIP BIKLE, Defendant-Appellant.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
(CASE NO. 3DTC-16-005744)
ORDER
DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
AND
DISMISSING AS MOOT ALL PENDING MOTIONS IN CAAP-18-0000035
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
appellate jurisdiction over Defendant-Appellant Philip Bikle's
(Bikle) pro se appeal from the Honorable Harry P. Freitas's
January 4, 2018 interlocutory order entering Bikle's plea of not
guilty to Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai# i's (the State)
charges for operating a motor vehicle without a valid license in
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 286-102 (2007 &
Supp. 2017) and operating a motor vehicle without liability
insurance in violation of HRS ยง 431:10C-104 (2005), and
scheduling Bikle's trial for January 18, 2018.
"The right to an appeal is strictly statutory."  State
v. Ontiveros, 82 Hawai# i 446, 449, 923 P.2d 388, 391 (1996)
(citation omitted).  HRS ยง 641-12(a) (2016) provides that
"[a]ppeals upon the record shall be allowed from all finalNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
decisions and final judgments of district courts in all criminal
matters."  Consequently, "in order to appeal a criminal matter in
the district court, the appealing party must appeal from a
written judgment or order that has been filed with the clerk of
the court pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(b)(3)."  State v. Bohannon, 102
Hawai#i 228, 236, 74 P.3d 980, 988 (2003); see also  Rule 32(c)(2)
of the Hawai# i Rules of Penal Procedure.  And even when the
district court enters a judgment of conviction, "[j]udgments of
conviction are not final unless they include the final
adjudication and the final sentence."  State v. Kilborn , 109
Hawai#i 435, 442, 127 P.3d 95, 102 (App. 2005) (dismissing an
appeal from a district court judgment of conviction that did not
finally determine the entire sentence).  
In the instant case, the record shows that the district
court did not hold a trial on January 18, 2018, and, instead, the
district court stayed the case pending the resolution of this
appeal.  Absent an appealable final judgment, the January 4, 2018
interlocutory order is not eligible for appellate review, and
Bikle's appeal is premature.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
case number CAAP-18-0000035 is dismissed for lack of appellate
jurisdiction.  IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending
motions in appellate court case number CAAP-18-0000035 are
dismissed as moot.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, June 7, 2018.
