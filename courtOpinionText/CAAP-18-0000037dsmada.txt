APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
HONOLULU DIVISION 
(CASE NO. 1RC12-1-925) 
ORDER GRANTING IN PART MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of Plaintiff-Counterclaim 
Defendant/Appellee Lorna Souza, Trustee's (Souza) August 31, 2018 
Motion to Dismiss Elizabeth Fisher's Appeals and for Sanctions 
(Motion), the papers in support, the record, and there being no 
opposition, it appears that: 
(1) On May 1, 2018, the circuit court clerk filed the 
record on appeal, and the appellate clerk notified the parties 
that, among other things, the opening brief was due on or before 
June 12, 2018; 
(2)
 After two extensions, the opening brief was due on 
or before August 13, 2018; 
(3) Fisher failed to file the opening brief or timely 
request another extension; NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(4) On August 28, 2018, the appellate clerk entered a 
notice of default for the opening brief, indicating the matter 
would be called to the court's attention on or before 
September 7, 2018, for action that could include dismissal, under 
Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 30, and Fisher 
could seek relief from default by motion; 
(5) On August 31, 2018, Souza filed the instant Motion 
to dismiss the appeal, under HRAP Rule 30, and for sanctions, because Fisher failed to file the opening brief and the 
consolidated appeals are frivolous. Souza also requested a 
ruling indicating the district court had jurisdiction to file the 
December 18, 2017 amended order for damages and the February 9, 
2018 order granting Souza's motion to correct the amended order 
for damages; 
(6)
 A response to the Motion was due on or before 
September 10, 2018. See HRAP Rule 26(a) & 27(a); 
(7)
 On January 11, 2019, the court granted Fisher's 
(a) September 10, 2018 motion for an extension of time to file an 
opposition to the Motion to dismiss the appeal, (b) September 10, 
2018 motion for an extension of time to file a motion for relief 
from default of the opening brief, (c) September 24, 2018 motion 
and amended motion for an additional extension of time to file an 
opposition to the Motion to dismiss the appeal, (d) September 24, 
2018 motion for an additional extension of time to file a motion 
for relief from default of the opening brief and renewed motion 
to stay appellate proceedings, and (e) October 8, 2018 motion for 
a third extension of time to file an opposition to the Motion to 
dismiss the appeal. The court ordered Fisher to file, within ten 
days, an opposition to the Motion to dismiss the appeal and a 
separate motion for relief from default of the opening brief. 
The court cautioned Fisher that failure to file either document 
may result in sanctions authorized by HRAP Rule 30, including, 
without limitation, monetary sanctions, the appeal being 
dismissed, or both. The court also issued an order to show cause 
to Fisher concerning her failure to timely file the opening brief 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
or request an extension, and ordered Fisher to file a response 
within ten days. The court cautioned Fisher that failure to 
timely respond to the order to show cause or to show good cause 
may result in sanctions; 
(8) The three documents required by the January 11, 
2019 order and order to show cause were due on or before 
January 22, 2019; 
(9) On January 25, 2019, the court granted Fisher's 
January 22, 2019 motion for an extension of time to file the 
documents required by the January 11, 2019 order and order to 
show cause. The court ordered Fisher to file the documents 
within ten days from the order, which would have been February 4, 
2019, and that no further extensions would be granted absent 
extraordinary circumstances. The court cautioned Fisher that 
failure to timely file the documents may result in sanctions 
described in the January 11, 2019 order and order to show cause; 
(10) On February 7, 2019, the court granted Fisher's 
February 5, 2019 motion for another extension of time to file the 
documents required by the January 11, 2019 order and order to 
show cause. The court ordered Fisher to file the documents 
within ten days from the order, which would have been 
February 19, 2019, and that no further extensions would be 
granted absent extraordinary circumstances. The court again 
cautioned Fisher that failure to timely file the documents may 
result in sanctions described in the January 11, 2019 order and 
order to show cause; and 
(11) Fisher has not filed the three documents required 
by the January 11, 2019 order and order to show cause, that is, 
she has not filed a response to the August 28, 2018 notice of 
default of the opening brief, an opposition to Souza's August 31, 
2018 Motion to dismiss the appeal, or a response to the 
January 11, 2019 order to show cause concerning her failure to 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
timely file the opening brief or request an extension. HRAP Rule 
30 provides, in part: 
Rule 30. BRIEFS NOT TIMELY FILED OR NOT IN CONFORMITY 
WITH THESE RULES.
 When the brief for appellant is not filed within
the time required, the appellate clerk shall forthwith
give notice to the parties that the matter will becalled to the attention of the appellate court on aday certain for such action as the appellate courtdeems proper and that the appeal may be dismissed. 
Because Fisher failed to file the opening brief within the time 
required and received notice that the appeal could be dismissed 
as a result, through both Souza's Motion to dismiss the appeal 
and the default notice, the court will grant in part Souza's 
Motion to dismiss the appeal, and dismiss the appeal. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is 
granted in part and denied in part as follows: 
(1) The request to dismiss this consolidated appeal is 
granted, and the appeal is dismissed. 
(2)
 All other requested relief is denied.
