IN THE MATTER OF THE GUARDIANSHIP AND CONSERVATORSHIP OF
STANLEY M. ZEDALIS, AN INCAPACITATED PERSON 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CG NO. 13-1-0003) 
CAAP-18-0000041 
IN THE MATTER OF STANLEY M. AND MARTHA B. ZEDALIS 
LIVING TRUST DATED JUNE 24, 2004  
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(TR NO. 14-1-00020) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Wadsworth and Nakasone, JJ.) 
This consolidated appeal  arises out of disputes among  
the nine children of Stanley M. Zedalis (Zedalis)
 and Martha B. 
Zedalis (Martha) (collectively, the parents) following the death 1
1 On October 18, 2019, we consolidated the appeal from the trust
petition in CAAP-18-0000041 ( Trust appeal ), with the appeal from the
conservatorship petition in CAAP-18-0000040 ( Conservatorship appeal ). 
All orders and judgments at issue in this consolidated appeal were
entered by the Third Circuit Court sitting in probate ( Probate Court ).
Honorable Henry T. Nakamoto entered the judgments and orders denying the
motions for reconsideration in both appeals. Honorable Glenn S. Hara entered the orders deciding the conservatorship and trustee petitions in both appeals.

of Martha in 2012, regarding the guardianship and conservatorship 
of Zedalis, who died in 2013, and concerning who should serve as successor trustee of the parents' trust (Zedalis Trust). 
The Conservatorship appeal was filed by self-
represented Petitioner-Appellant Lillian J. Zedalis (Lillian), 
Zedalis's daughter, who served as temporary guardian and 
conservator of Zedalis. Lillian appeals from the (1) May 13, 2016 "Decision and Order and Decree as to Conservator's Petitions for Discharge and for Approval of Accounts Filed on May 2, 2014, and Also on August 24, 2015" (Conservatorship Petition Order); 
(2) June 27, 2017 Amended Final Judgment (Amended Conservatorship
Judgment); and (3) December 22, 2017 "Court Order Denying 
Petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration and Relief From Amended 
Judgment Entered June 27, 2017, and to Reopen Matter, Make New Findings of Fact and Amend Its Judgment, and Motion for Leave to File an Interlocutory Appeal, Filed on July 14, 2017" (Conservatorship Reconsideration Order). On appeal, Lillian 
raises multiple points of error,
2 challenging the May 13, 2016 
Conservatorship Petition Order on grounds that the Probate Court 
erred by: determining that there was a "budget overage, breach of duty, and surcharge"; finding Lillian made wrongful transfers from the trust; ordering Lillian to personally pay the guardian ad litem's fees "as punishment" for the trust transfers; and failing to issue a written order of assignment and to order an evidentiary hearing for this "contested accounting matter" under Hawai#i Probate Rules (HPR) Rules 19 and 20.
3 While it is not 
raised as a point of error, Lillian also argues the Probate Court erred in denying Lillian's motion for reconsideration, which 
2 Lillian's points of error have been restated and consolidated for
clarity. 
3 HPR Rule 19 defines what is a "contested matter." HPR Rule 20,
entitled "Disposition of Contested Matters," allows the probate court to
retain a contested matter or to assign it to the circuit court civil trialscalendar; the rule also provides guidelines for such assignmentdeterminations.

"point[ed] out the Court's errors" and requested "the Court to 
re-open the matter to fix the errors."4 
The Trust appeal was filed by Lillian and her sister, 
self-represented Petitioner-Appellant Maryann Jolin (Maryann). 
Lillian and Maryann appeal from the (1) June 23, 2016 "Amended 
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order (1) Denying Petition to Confirm [Lillian] and [Maryann] as Co-Trustees of the [Zedalis Trust] Dated June 24, 2004, and (2) Confirming Respondent-Appellee William P. Zedalis as Successor Trustee Said [sic] Trust" (Amended Trust Petition Order); (2) June 14, 2017 
Final Judgment (Trust Judgment); and (3) December 22, 2017 "Order 
Denying Motion for Reconsideration, and Relief, and to Make New 
Findings of Fact and Conclusions, Filed June 26, 2017 and Motion for Leave to File an Interlocutory Appeal, Filed July 13, 2017" (Trust Reconsideration Order).
5 On appeal, Lillian and Maryann 
raise multiple points of error,6 on various legal and evidentiary 
grounds, challenging the Probate Court's June 23, 2016 Trust Petition Order. They contend that the Probate Court erred by removing Lillian and Maryann as trustees and replacing them with Zedalis's son, William P. Zedalis (William), as successor 
4 While Lillian appeals from the Conservatorship Reconsideration
Order, Lillian does not specifically challenge this order in her points of
error, yet presents argument regarding the Probate Court's denial of hermotions for reconsideration. See Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure ( HRAP)
Rules 28(b)(4) (requiring statement of each alleged error committed by thelower court in the points of error section); 28(b)(7) (requiring argument oneach point presented). Despite noncompliance with HRAP Rule 28, in view ofthe policy of deciding cases on their merits, we nevertheless addressLillian's argument to the extent we can discern it. See Marvin v. Pflueger

5 No argument regarding the December 22, 2107 Trust Reconsideration
Order is presented in the Opening Brief, and we do not address this order.See HRAP Rule 28(b)(7) ("Points not argued may be deemed waived.").

or issue an order of assignment under HPR Rules 19 and 20, because there were genuine issues of material fact. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
7 
submitted by Lillian and Maryann, we dismiss in part and affirm in part. 
Conservatorship proceedings 
On April 15, 2013, Lillian filed a petition for 
appointment of a guardian and conservator of Zedalis 
(conservatorship petition) based on the allegation that he was 
incapacitated, and proposing Lillian and Maryann as co-
conservators. 
Marcia B. Zedalis Maire (Marcia), another one of 
Zedalis's daughters, filed an objection. 
On June 18, 2013, the Probate Court entered an order 
appointing Lillian as the temporary guardian and conservator of Zedalis, and appointed attorney G. Kay Iopa as the Guardian Ad Litem (GAL) for Zedalis. 
On September 6, 2013, the Probate Court entered an 
order appointing Lillian as the permanent guardian and conservator of Zedalis, and appointing the GAL long term for Zedalis. 
On April 1, 2014, the Probate Court entered an order 
discharging the GAL and awarding the GAL her fees. 
On April 7, 2014, Marcia and William filed a joint 
petition for an order requiring Lillian to provide an accounting of the funds and assets she controlled as conservator. 
On May 2, 2014, Lillian filed a petition for discharge 
as conservator and for approval of the final accounting. Marcia 
and William filed an objection on June 6, 2014. 
7 In both appeals, only Opening Briefs were filed; there were no
Answering Briefs. 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Following an August 19, 2015 hearing, the Probate Court 
terminated the conservatorship and guardianship but retained 
jurisdiction to address the disputed accounting, and ordered Lillian to file a supplemental accounting. 
On August 24, 2015, Lillian filed her supplemental 
accounting and a motion to approve it. 
On May 9, 2016, Lillian filed a motion to discharge 
herself as the guardian and conservator of Zedalis, and for approval of the final accounting. 
On May 13, 2016, the Probate Court entered the 
Conservatorship Petition Order pertinent to this appeal, granting Lillian's petition to discharge Lillian as guardian and conservator, but also surcharging Lillian for breaches of her fiduciary duty, and ordering Lillian to pay, in her individual capacity, the GAL's fees of $4,095.28, and $659.05 for expenditures in excess of the budget. 
On May 23, 2016, Lillian filed a "Motion for 
Reconsideration of the [Conservatorship Petition Order]" (first 
motion for reconsideration or relief), which was denied by order 
filed May 30, 2017. 
On June 13, 2016, Lillian filed a "Motion for Recusal 
of Judge Glenn S. Hara and for Relief from [Conservatorship 
Petition Order]" (second motion for reconsideration or relief), 
denied by order filed November 28, 2016. 
On July 14, 2016, Lillian filed a "Motion for Relief 
from [Conservatorship Petition Order]" (third motion for 
reconsideration or relief), for which the record contains no 
disposition. 
On March 31, 2017, Lillian filed a Notice of Hearing on 
a "Motion for Relief of Judgment and Surcharge From 
[Conservatorship Petition Order]" (fourth motion for

reconsideration or relief),8 which was denied by order filed May 
30, 2017. 
On May 30, 2017, the Probate Court entered judgment 
(Initial Conservatorship Judgment) pursuant to the May 13, 2016 
Conservatorship Petition Order. 
On June 27, 2017, the Probate Court entered the Amended 
Conservatorship Judgment pertaining to this appeal, containing 
the certification "no just reason for delay" pursuant to Hawai# i 
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP
) Rule 54(b).9 
On July 6, 2017, Lillian filed a "Motion for 
Reconsideration and Relief from 'Amended Final Judgment' Entered June 27, 2017 and to Reopen this Matter, Make New Findings and Amend its Judgment" (fifth motion for reconsideration or relief), 
which was denied by the December 22, 2017 Conservatorship 
Reconsideration Order pertinent to this appeal. 
On January 18, 2018, Lillian Zedalis filed a notice of 
appeal creating the Conservatorship appeal.
Trust proceedings 
On December 30, 2014, Lillian and Maryann filed a 
petition in the underlying trust case, requesting the Probate 
Court to confirm them as co-trustees of the Zedalis Trust. William filed an objection. 
On May 13, 2016, the Probate Court entered an order 
denying Lillian and Maryann's petition and confirming William as trustee of the Zedalis Trust. 
On June 23, 2016, the Probate Court entered the amended 
Trust Petition Order pertinent to this appeal, containing the additional finding of "no just reason for delay" pursuant to HRCP 
8 While the notice of hearing for the motion was filed, it appears
that the underlying motion was not filed. This fourth motion for 
reconsideration or relief was heard on May 25, 2017 by the Honorable Harry P.Freitas.

Rule 54(b). The Probate Court also entered a June 23, 2016 
judgment in favor of William and against Lillian and Maryann. 
On July 22, 2016, Lillian and Maryann filed a notice of 
appeal from the June 23, 2016 judgment, which became CAAP-16-0000533. On May 31, 2017, this court dismissed the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
On June 14, 2017, the Probate Court entered the amended 
Trust Judgment pertinent to this appeal, containing the certification pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b), in favor of William and against Lillian and Maryann. 
On June 26, 2017, Lillian and Maryann filed a motion 
for reconsideration of the June 14, 2017 Trust Judgment, which 
was denied by the Probate Court's December 22, 2017 Trust 
Reconsideration Order pertinent to this appeal. 
On January 18, 2018, Lillian and Maryann filed a notice 
of appeal creating the Trust appeal. 
We lack appellate jurisdiction over the petition orders
and judgments in both the Conservatorship appeal andthe Trust appeal. 
In appeals from civil cases, "the notice of appeal 
shall be filed within 30 days after entry of the judgment or 
appealable order." HRAP Rule 4(a)(1). 
With the exception of the challenged denial of the 
motion for reconsideration, Lillian's points of error in the Conservatorship appeal all challenge the May 13, 2016 Conservatorship Petition Order. This order became appealable upon entry of the initial May 30, 2017 Conservatorship Judgment.
10 Lillian's January 18, 2018 notice of appeal, 
however, was not timely filed within thirty days after entry of the initial May 30, 2017 Conservatorship Judgment. Because the Conservatorship appeal was not timely filed, we lack jurisdiction

over Lillian's appeal from the May 13, 2016 Conservatorship 
Petition Order and the June 27, 2017 Amended Conservatorship Judgment. See HRAP Rule 4(a)(1). 
In the Trust appeal, Lillian and Maryann's points of 
error all challenge the June 23, 2016 Trust Petition Order. This order became appealable upon entry of the June 14, 2017 Trust Judgment. Lillian and Maryann's January 18, 2018 notice of appeal, however, was not timely filed within thirty days after entry of the June 14, 2017 Trust Judgment. Because the Trust appeal was not timely filed, we lack jurisdiction over Lillian and Maryann's appeal from the June 23, 2016 Amended Trust Petition Order and the June 14, 2017 Trust Judgment. See id. 
The post-judgment reconsideration motions did not toll
the deadline for appeal. 
Relevant to the Conservatorship appeal, following the 
May 30, 2017 Initial Conservatorship Judgment and the June 27, 
2017 Amended Conservatorship Judgment, Lillian filed the fifth motion for reconsideration or relief as a post-judgment motion on July 6, 2017. In the Trust appeal, following the entry of the June 14, 2017 Trust Judgment, Lillian and Maryann filed a post-judgment motion for reconsideration on June 26, 2017. For the reasons explained below, these post-judgment motions for reconsideration filed as to both the Initial Conservatorship Judgment and the Trust Judgment did not extend the thirty-day time period to appeal. 
A timely post-judgment motion invokes the tolling 
provision in HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) if the court rule authorizing the 
motion specifies the time by which the motion must be filed: 
(3) Time to appeal affected by post-judgment
motions. If any party files a timely motion for
judgment as a matter of law, to amend findings or makeadditional findings, for a new trial, to reconsider,alter or amend the judgment or order, or forattorney's fees or costs, and court or agency rulesspecify the time by which the motion shall be filed,then the time for filing the notice of appeal is 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
extended for all parties until 30 days after entry of
an order disposing of the motion. 
(Emphases added.) Here, the court rules applicable to the 
conservatorship and trust proceedings are the HPR. See HPR Rule 
1;11 HPR Rule 20. Thus, if the HPR specify the "time by which 
the motion [for reconsideration] shall be filed," then the deadline to file a notice of appeal is extended until thirty days after entry of the order disposing of the motion filed, under HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). See Nakaoka v. Shizuru, 151 Hawai# i 510, 514, 
517 P.3d 793, 797 (App. 2022) (holding that because the pertinent rule, HRCP Rule 54(d)(1)
12 "does not specify the time by which a 
motion for costs must be filed as measured from the entry of judgment, a post-judgment motion for costs under HRCP Rule 54(d)(1) does not qualify as a tolling motion under HRAP Rule 4(a)(3)"). 
11 HPR Rule 1 provides: "These rules govern the procedure in the
circuit courts of the State of Hawai #i in all probate, conservatorship,
guardianship, trust, legal representation for no fault benefits, and
determination of death proceedings . . . ." 
Moreover, the Probate Court
clearly retained the contested matter in probate court and did not designatethat the HRCP would apply. See HPR Rule 20(a) and (d) ("(a) Assignment. The
court by written order may retain a contested matter on the regular probatecalendar or may assign the contested matter to the civil trials calendar ofthe circuit court. . . . (d) Procedures in Retained Contested Matters.Whenever the court retains jurisdiction of a contested matter as a probateproceeding, the court in the order of assignment may, at the request of theparties, designate and order that any one or more of the [HRCP] and/or theRules of the Circuit Courts shall be applicable in such matter."). 
12 HRCP Rule 54(d)(1), which provides for an award of costs to the
prevailing party, does not specify a deadline by which a motion for costs mustbe filed. The rule states: 
(1) Costs Other Than Attorneys' Fees. Except when expressprovision therefor is made either in a statute or in theserules, costs shall be allowed as of course to the prevailingparty unless the court otherwise directs; but costs againstthe State or a county, or an officer or agency of the Stateor a county, shall be imposed only to the extent permittedby law. Costs may be taxed by the clerk on 48 hours' notice.On motion served within 5 days thereafter, the action of theclerk may be reviewed by the court. 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Under the HPR, a post-judgment motion for 
reconsideration is governed by HPR Rule 36(b),13 which does not 
"specify the time by which the motion shall be filed[.]" HRAP 
Rule 4(a)(3). HPR Rule 36(b) provides that a "petition" for relief "from an order or judgment" may be filed "within a reasonable time," as follows: 
Rule 36. RELIEF FROM ORDER. 
. . . . 
(b)
 Mistakes; Inadvertence; Excusable Neglect;
Newly Discovered Evidence; Fraud, Etc. Upon petition
and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve
an interested person from an order or judgment for thefollowing reasons: 
(1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect; 
(2) newly discovered evidence which by due
diligence could not have been discovered in timebefore the order was issued; 
(3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated
intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or othermisconduct of an adverse party; 
(4) the order is void; 
(5) the order has been satisfied, released, or
discharged, or a prior order upon which it is based
has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is nolonger equitable that the order should haveprospective application; or 
(6) any other reason justifying relief from the
operation of the order. The petition shall be made
within a reasonable time, and for reasons (1), (2),and (3) not more than one year after the order orproceeding was entered or taken. A petition underthis subdivision (b) does not affect the finality ofan order or suspend its operation. 
13 Subsection (a) of HPR Rule 36 pertains to "[c]lerical mistakes"
and is not pertinent to this appeal. 
10  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(Emphasis added.) Thus, unlike HRCP Rule 59,  which provides 
that post-judgment motions under the HRCP for a new trial or to 
alter or amend judgment must be filed within ten days after entry 14
of judgment, HPR Rule 36(b) does not contain a set deadline for motions, as measured from the entry of judgment. See Nakaoka, 
151 Hawai# i at 514, 517 P.3d at 797. HPR Rule 36(b) requires 
14 HRCP Rule 59 states: 
Rule 59. NEW TRIALS; AMENDMENT OF JUDGMENTS. 
(a) Grounds.  A new trial may be granted to all
or any of the parties and on all or part of the issues
(1) in an action in which there has been a trial byjury, for any of the reasons for which new trials haveheretofore been granted in actions at law in the courtsof the State; and (2) in an action tried without a jury,for any of the reasons for which rehearings haveheretofore been granted in suits in equity in thecourts of the State. On a motion for a new trial in an action tried without a jury, the court may open thejudgment if one has been entered, take additionaltestimony, amend findings of fact and conclusions oflaw or make new findings and conclusions, and directthe entry of a new judgment. 
(b) Time for motion.  A motion for a new trial 
shall be filed no later than 10 days after entry of thejudgment. 
(c) Time for serving affidavits. When a 
motion for new trial is based on affidavits, they shallbe filed with the motion. The opposing party has 10days after service to file opposing affidavits, but thatperiod may be extended for up to 20 days, either bythe court for good cause or by the parties' writtenstipulation. The court may permit reply affidavits. 
(d) On court's initiative; notice; specifying
grounds. No later than 10 days after entry of
judgment the court, on its own, may order a new trialfor any reason that would justify granting one on aparty's motion. After giving the parties notice and anopportunity to be heard, the court may grant a timelymotion for a new trial, for a reason not stated in themotion. When granting a new trial on its owninitiative or for a reason not stated in a motion, thecourt shall specify the grounds in its order. 
(e) Motion to alter or amend judgment. Any
motion to alter or amend a judgment shall be filed nolater than 10 days after entry of the judgment. 
(Emphases added.) 
11 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that the petition for relief "be made within a reasonable time," 
with an outer maximum limit of one year for the grounds set forthin subsections (1), (2), and (3). Because HPR Rule 36(b) contains no time limit by which a post-judgment motion must be filed, the tolling provision of HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) extending the time for filing the notice of appeal "until 30 days after entry of an order disposing of the motion" does not apply in these appeals.  
In addition, HPR Rule 36 is substantially similar to 
HRCP Rule 60,  the parallel provision in the HRCP providing for
15 
15 HRCP Rule 60 provides: 
Rule 60. RELIEF FROM JUDGMENT OR ORDER. 
(a) Clerical mistakes. Clerical mistakes in 
judgments, orders or other parts of the record and
errors therein arising from oversight or omission maybe corrected by the court at any time of its owninitiative or on the motion of any party and aftersuch notice, if any, as the court orders. During thependency of an appeal, such mistakes may be socorrected before the appeal is docketed, andthereafter while the appeal is pending may be socorrected with leave of the appellate court. 
(b) Mistakes; inadvertence; excusable neglect;
newly discovered evidence; fraud, etc. On motion and 
upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve aparty or a party's legal representative from a finaljudgment, order, or proceeding for the followingreasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, orexcusable neglect; (2) newly discovered evidence whichby due diligence could not have been discovered intime to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b);(3)fraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic orextrinsic), misrepresentation, or other misconduct ofan adverse party; (4) the judgment is void; (5) thejudgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged,or a prior judgment upon which it is based has beenreversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longerequitable that the judgment should have prospectiveapplication; or (6) any other reason justifying relieffrom the operation of the judgment.

post-judgment relief on grounds similar to those set forth in HPR 
Rule 36(b). This court has held that, generally, a post-judgment motion brought under HRCP Rule 60(b) is not a tolling motion under HRAP Rule 4(a)(3)). Simbajon v. Gentry, 81 Hawai# i 193, 
196, 914 P.3d 1386, 1389 (App. 1996). 
Here, in the Conservatorship appeal, Lillian's July 6, 
2017 post-judgment motion for reconsideration or relief from the May 30, 2017 Conservatorship Judgment did not toll the deadline to file a notice of appeal under HPR Rule 36(b) and HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). Thus, the January 18, 2018 notice of appeal was not timely as to the May 30, 2017 Initial Conservatorship Judgment; the June 27, 2017 Amended Conservatorship Judgment; and the underlying May 13, 2016 Conservatorship Petition Order that preceded them. We consequently lack jurisdiction over the appeal from them. 
Similarly, in the Trust appeal, Lillian and Maryann's
June 26, 2017 post-judgment motion for reconsideration of the
June 14, 2017 Trust Judgment did not toll the deadline to file a
notice of appeal under HPR Rule 36(b) and HRAP Rule 4(a)(3).
Thus, the January 18, 2018 notice of appeal was not timely as to 
the June 14, 2017 Trust Judgment, and the June 23, 2016 Amended Trust Petition Order that preceded it; and we consequently lack jurisdiction over the appeal from them.
Denial of Lillian's fifth motion for reconsideration or 
relief was not an abuse of discretion. 
The December 22, 2017 Conservatorship Reconsideration 
Order that is the subject of this appeal, disposes of Lillian's 
fifth motion for reconsideration or relief filed on July 6, 2017. 
from a judgment, order, or proceeding, or to set aside
a judgment for fraud upon the court.

Lillian argues that the Probate Court's "mathematical and 
categorical errors" were "pointed out in [her] Motion for Reconsiderations [sic] and Relief filed on May 23, 2016 (ROA) DKT # 25 at 508-517, and at 520-527, and at 536-543, and 571-78, with the Court denying the Motions Id. [sic] at 551, 555, 653." These record references are for multiple similar motions for reconsideration or relief that Lillian filed. Lillian's record references correspond to four separate motions for reconsideration or relief filed below, but the record summarized supra reflects that there were actually five such motions.  In 
her Opening Brief, Lillian presents detailed argument regarding 
her first motion for reconsideration or relief that was filed on May 23, 2016, and not for the fifth motion for reconsideration or relief at issue in this appeal. 
"The trial court's ruling on a motion for 
reconsideration is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard." Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Wailea Elua v. Wailea 
Resort Co., 100 Hawai# i 97, 110, 58 P.3d 608, 621 (2002) 
(citation omitted). 
[T]he purpose of a motion for reconsideration is to
allow the parties to present new evidence and/or arguments
that could not have been presented during the earlieradjudicated motion. Reconsideration is not a device torelitigate old matters or to raise arguments or evidencethat could and should have been brought during the earlierproceeding.

(alteration in original) (quoting Sousaris v. Miller, 92 Hawai# i 
505, 513, 993 P.2d 539, 547 (2000)). 
Here, the record reflects that the December 22, 2017 
Conservatorship Reconsideration Order denied Lillian's fifth 
motion for reconsideration or relief. This fifth motion attempted to relitigate Lillian's request for reconsideration or relief from the Conservatorship Petition Order that had been previously denied multiple times, and it was thus not a proper motion for reconsideration. See id. The Probate Court's denial 
14  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of the fifth motion for reconsideration or relief was not an 
abuse of discretion. See Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Wailea 
Elua, 100 Hawai# i at 110, 58 P.3d at 621. 
For the foregoing reasons, we dismiss the appeal in
