  On appeal, Sudaria and Geddings contend that the 
default judgment was void under Hawai‘ i District Court Rules of 
Civil Procedure (DCRCP) Rule 60(b)(4).  Sudaria and Geddings 
argue that they were deprived of due process, DCRCP Rule 55 was not satisfied, and they met the requirements under BDM, Inc. v. 
Sageco, Inc., 57 Haw. 73, 76-77, 549 P.2d 1147, 1150 (1976).2  
For all of these arguments, Sudaria and Geddings primarily rely 
on the assertion that notice was improper.  For the reasons 
discussed below, we vacate and remand. 
I.  BACKGROUND 
A. Small Claims Case – Geddings et al. v. Pirslin 
(Return of Security Deposit) 
 
Before the complaint in the case underlying this 
appeal was filed, Sudaria and Geddings (self-represented) filed a complaint on May 30, 2017 in the District Court of the First 
  
 
2    Sudaria and Geddings also assert that (1) DCRCP Rule 55 was not 
satisfied because there was no supporting affidavit, the complaint was not 
verified, "and no one appeared at the hearing" to request a default; and 
(2) Plaintiff- Appellee Property Center, Inc. (Property Center) l acked 
standing because it was not a real party in interest.  However, these points were not raised in their motion to set aside and, thus, we consider these 
points waived.  See Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Wailea Elua v. Wailea Resort 
Co., 100 Hawai‘i 97, 107 , 58  P.3d 608, 618 (2002) ("Legal issues not raised in 
the trial court are ordinarily deemed waived on appeal") ; Lagondino v. 
Maldonado, 7 Haw. App. 591, 596, 789 P.2d 1129, 1132-33 (1990) (explaining 
that "a real party in interest objection raised for the first time on appeal is untimely"). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 Circuit, Small Claims for return of their security deposit from 
their former landlord Snezana Pirslin (Pirslin).3 
During the August 23, 2017 hearing on the Small Claims 
matter, Geddings and Sudaria were present, along with Pirslin's 
property managers, Lynn and Malcolm Shiroma, at District Court 
in courtroom 10B at 1:36 p.m.4  The court minutes stated,  
MRS SHIROMA REPRESENTED THAT SHE AND MR SHIROMA REPRESENT 
SNEZANA PIRSLIN AND THAT THERE IS A DAMAGES CLAIM AGAINST 
PLTFFS SET ON 9/5/17 10B.   BY ORDER OF THE COURT, CASE 
CONTINUED FOR STATUS TO 10/25/17 10B 1:30 PM.  REMINDER 
NOTICE PROVIDED TO PARTIES.  MRS SHIROMA REQUESTS THAT THE 
DEFENDANT BE AMENDED TO PROPERTY CENTER INC; DENIED . 
 
(Emphasis added.)   
As stated in the court minutes, the Small Claims court 
continued the Small Claims case to October 25, 2017 "for status" 
and denied Lynn Shiroma's request that "Defendant be amended to 
Property Center, Inc."  (Formatting altered.) B. Regular Claims Case - Property Center v. Sudaria et al. 
(Assumpsit-Money Owed) 
  
On July 17, 2017, while the Small Claims case was 
pending, Property Center (represented by counsel), filed a 
"Complaint (Assumpsit-Money Owed); Declaration; Exhibit(s); 
Summons" in Regular Claims court.  (Formatting altered.)  In the

1-001105.  See Roxas v. Marcos, 89 Hawai‘ i 91, 110  n.9, 969 P.2d 1209, 1228  
n.9 (1998) (explaining that " courts have generally recognized that they may, 
in appropriate circumstances, take notice of proceedings in other courts, 
both within and without their judicial system, if those proceedings have a 
direct relation to the matter at issue" ) (citations and brackets omitted).

 Complaint, Property Center asked for judgment in the principal 
amount of $8,289.65.  Attached to the Complaint were the 
following:  
(1) A copy of the rental agreement; 
(2) A revised tenant ledger showing $8,289.65 owed to 
Property Center ($1,950.00 in rental and late 
fees, $7,814.65 in repairs, and $75.00 for 
security key and garage opener replacements, less 
$1,550.00 security deposit) plus attorney's fees 
and costs; 
(3) An invoice from PLS Builders showing repair work 
totaling $7,814.65; and 
(4) A two-page summons.  
The first page of the summons required the defendant 
to appear, stating:  
"IF YOU OR YOUR ATTORNEY FAIL TO ATTEND THE COURT 
HEARING AT THE TIME AND PLACE DESIGNATED, DEFAULT AND DEFAULT JUDMGENT WILL BE TAKEN AGAINST YOU FOR THE RELIEF DEMANDED IN THE COMPLAINT." 
(Formatting altered.)  The second page of the summons identified 
the location as "Honolulu Division, 1111 Alakea Street, 10th 
floor Courtroom 10A or 10B" and the time as "1:30 p.m. on the 
second Monday following date of service[.]" 
The return of service stated that the "Complaint 
(Assumpsit, Summary Possession/Landlord-Tenant, Damages;) NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 
5 
 Declaration Exhibits(s)" were served on Sudaria and Geddings 
personally on August 23, 2017, 1:04 p.m. at "1111 Alakea Street 
10th Floor Honolulu, Hawaii 96813[,]" which was the same day and 
place as the hearing in the Small Claims case.  (Formatting 
altered.) 
On September 5, 2017, the day after the second Monday 
following the service of the Complaint, the court minutes show 
that neither party appeared, and the Regular Claims court 
entered default against Sudaria and Geddings: 
"ATTY RICHARD YANAGI NOT PRESENT FOR PLTFF 
PROPERTY CENTER . . . .  DEFTS JR SUDARIA AND SCOTTY GEDDINGS NOT PRESENT, BY ORDER OF THE COURT, DEFAULT ENTERED-VERIFIED." 
In late September 2017, Property Center filed an "Ex 
Parte Motion for Default Judgment; Declaration; Exhibit(s) 
1 through 5; Declaration of Counsel re: Attorney's Fees; Order."

(Formatting altered.)  On September 28, 2017, the Regular Claims court granted the Ex Parte Motion for Default Judgment, awarding the principal amount of $8,289.65 requested in the Complaint 
plus $1,000.00 in attorney's fees and costs, for a total of 
$9,289.65.  The Regular Claims court entered a default judgment

 against Sudaria and Geddings on October 3, 2017, awarding the 
$9,289.65 requested. 
C. Post Default Judgment 
 1. Small Claims Case - Dismissed Without Prejudice 
  On October 25, 2017, the return date for the Small 
Claims case, the court dismissed the case without prejudice.6  
The court minutes note that although Sudaria and Geddings claimed they were not served with the Complaint in the Regular 
Claims case, the Small Claims court determined they were served 
and the security-deposit issue was resolved:   
"DEFTS CLAIM JUDGMENT FOR SECURITY DEPOSIT WAS 
ENTERED ON 9/5/2017.  PLTFFS CLAIM THEY WERE NOT 
SERVED WITH THE COMPLAINT.  DURING RECESS COURT 
REVIEWED FILE FROM CASE 1RC17-1-4580, AND 
DETERMINED THAT DEFTS WERE SERVED AND SECURITY DEPOSIT ISSUE WAS RESOLVED.  BY ORDER OF THE COURT, CASE DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE." 
(Emphasis added.) 
2. Regular Claims Case - Garnishment and Motion to Set 
Aside 
 
In the Regular Claims case, Property Center moved to 
garnish Sudaria's and Geddings's wages, which was granted.  The 
return of service for the issuance of the garnishee summons 
 
 6  The Honorable Maura M. Okamoto presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

  shows that Sudaria's and Geddings's employers were served on 
November 27 and 28, 2017. 
A little over a week later, on December 8, 2017, 
Sudaria and Geddings (still self-represented) filed a motion to 
"Set Aside Default, Judgment & Stay Garnishment[.]"  (Formatting 
altered.)  Sudaria and Geddings left blank the portion of the 
form that permits the movant to indicate the legal basis for the 
motion.  In a type-written declaration attached to their motion, 
Sudaria and Geddings stated they "were never informed for any 
other court date" with a handwritten notation, "Missing Page 2 of Summons - Form 1DC50."  (Formatting altered.) 
Property Center opposed the motion.  At the hearing on 
the motion, Geddings explained that they appeared for the 
August 23, 2017 hearing in the Small Claims case and received 
the summons to appear on September 5, 2017, in the following 
exchange: 
[Geddings:]  And when we left that day -- we had 
explained to the judge, too, that the date of 
September 5th, we -- that would create a hardship on our -- 
on our work because we were already taking off time half of 
the month of September to go to the mainland for a wedding, 
family wedding.  And we would be back at the beginning of 
October.  So that's why she ordered us to come back 
October 25th on a status and if we had gotten together to 
discuss what was going on in this dis pute. 
 
[Regular Claims  Court:]   Okay.  But you were also 
informed at that time about the date of September 5th for 
the answer. 
 
[Geddings:]   
Yeah, but we explained the reason why.  
And, you know, when we received the sli p to come back on 
October 25th, that's where, you know, it -- it became -- NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 
8 
 [Regular Claims Court:]  There are two different 
cases, you understand. 
 
[Geddings:]  But we were under the understanding that 
-- or my thought was that if their case were being brought 
into this because they were submit -- their cases was 
subject to our security deposit and why they retained it. 
 . . . . 
 
[Regular Claims
 Court:]  I think you're conflating 
two different cases.  You were told on the one case on August 23rd that you had an answer date of September 5th. 
 
[Geddings:]  I t was --
  I -- we -- were under the 
impression that we were answering that day because we -- we 
recognized that we got the summons but we were not in an 
understanding that we had to come back on the 5th because 
when we --  
 
[Regular Claims  Court:]
  Well, if you look at the 
papers they're two different cases. 
 [Geddings:]  I know, Your Honor. 
 
[Regular Claims Court:]  And you didn't show up for 
one of them. 
 
[Geddings:]  That was -- that was complete confusion.  
And on the day that September 5th  came we, 
-- if we were -- 
if it would have been explicitly explained that that was a necessary thing because we expressed a hardship on that, 
that taking off that, because we -- we had taken so many 
days off beforehand to -- to come down, file motions and we 
just feel like we are due our day in court for a fair trial and -- and justice should be served. 
 
(Emphases added.) 
The Regular Claims court then found that Sudaria 
and Geddings were told of the September 5, 2017 date to 
answer, and denied their motion to set aside the default:  
[Regular Claims Court:]  . . . .  [t] he law in Hawai‘ i 
under the case of 
BDM, Inc. versus Sageco, Inc., a 1976 
case, is that a defendant moving to set aside a default 
judgment must establish that the plaintiff will not be prejudiced by setting aside the default judgment, that the 
defendants have a meritorious defense, and that the default 
was not the result of inexcusable neglect or a willful act. 
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 
9 
 It appears clear that the defendants were told at the 
August 23 or at the -- the hearing on the -- the -- the 
small claims case that there was a hearing set for 
September 5th, the answer date for the case, and that their 
case, the case on the security deposit, was continued to August [sic] 25th.  They did not appear on September 5th. 
 
There was also a lot of argument today that was not 
in the motion.  And the requirement is that they have to establish there's a meritorious defense and that their 
default was [sic] inexcusable and willful.   
 
And, therefore, based on what I have seen and heard 
today, I am going to deny the motion[.] 
 
After the Regular Claims court denied their motion to 
set aside, Sudaria and Geddings moved for reconsideration, which 
was also denied "as no new arguments or newly discovered 
evidence has been presented." 
Sudaria and Geddings (represented by counsel) appeal 
from the denial of their motion to set aside the default 
judgment. 
II.  STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
This court reviews DCRCP Rule 60(b)(4) decisions under 
the de novo standard.  See Wagner v. World Botanical Gardens, 
126 Hawai‘ i 190, 195, 268 P.3d 443, 448 (App. 2011) (explaining a 
court's ruling under Hawai
‘i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) 
Rule 60(b)(4) is reviewed de novo); Commentary to DCRCP Rule 60 
(noting the language in DCRCP Rule 60 and HRCP Rule 60 is 
identical).    
Findings of fact are reviewed under the clearly 
erroneous standard.  Bhakta v. Cnty. of Maui, 109 Hawai‘ i 198, NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 
10 
   208, 123 P.3d 943, 953 (2005).  A finding "is clearly erroneous 
when, despite evidence to support the finding, the appellate 
court is left with the definite and firm conviction in reviewing 
the entire evidence that a mistake has been committed."  Id. 
(citation omitted).  A finding "is also clearly erroneous when 
the record lacks substantial evidence to support the finding."  
Id. (citation omitted). 
The denial of a motion to set aside an entry of 
default is reviewed for abuse of discretion.  See Chen v. Mah, 
146 Hawai‘ i 157, 171, 457 P.3d 796, 810 (2020). 
III. DISCUSSION 
Sudaria and Geddings contend they were deprived of due 
process, DCRCP Rule 55 was not satisfied, and they met the 
requirements under BDM.  For all of these contentions, Sudaria 
and Geddings primarily rely on the assertion that they did not receive page two of the summons. 
Sudaria and Geddings claim in their amended opening 
brief that "they did not know the answering hearing date and 
time" and "[b]ecause they did not have this critical 
information, [they] were not present at their answer hearing . . . ." NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 
11 
 A. Denial Of The Motion To Set Aside Based On DCRCP 
Rule 60(b)(4) Was Not Error 
 
Sudaria and Geddings contend they were denied due 
process because they did not receive page two of the summons, 
claiming "they did not know the answering hearing date and time." 
"For good cause shown the court may set aside an entry 
of default and, if a judgment by default has been entered, may 
likewise set it aside in accordance with Rule 60(b)."  DCRCP 
Rule 55(c).  DCRCP Rule 60(b) provides in relevant part that 
"[o]n motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may 
relieve a party . . . from a final judgment, order, or 
proceeding for the following reasons: . . . (4) the judgment is 
void . . . ."  DCRCP Rule 60(b)(4). 
Whether a judgment is void under DCRCP Rule 60(b)(4) 
is not discretionary.  In re Application of Hana Ranch Co., 3 
Haw. App. 141, 146, 642 P.2d 938, 941 (1982) (examining HRCP 
Rule 60(b)(4)).  "It has been noted that a judgment is void only 
if the court that rendered it lacked jurisdiction of either the 
subject matter or the parties or otherwise acted in a manner 
inconsistent with due process of law."  Id. (citation omitted). 
Under due process, notice must be "reasonably 
calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 
12 
 opportunity to present their objections."  Eto v. Muranaka, 99 
Hawai‘i 488, 498, 57 P.3d 413, 423 (2002) (citation omitted); 
Espinosa v. United Student Aid Funds, Inc., 553 F.3d 1193, 1202 
(9th Cir. 2008) (citation omitted). 
Here, the Regular Claims court found that Sudaria and 
Geddings were told about the September 5, 2017 Regular Claims answer date: 
It appears clear that the defendants were told at the 
August 23 or at the -- t he hearing on the -- the -- the 
small claims case that there was a hearing set for 
September 5th, the answer date for the case, and that their 
case, the case on the security deposit, was continued to 
August [sic] 25th.  They did not appear on September 5th.  
 
The record in this case, and the Small Claims case, 
support this finding.  The summons filed in the record on appeal 
shows a page two, notifying Sudaria and Geddings of when and 
where to appear. 
During the hearing on the motion to set aside the 
default, Geddings acknowledged receiving the summons at the 
August 23, 2017 hearing in the Small Claims case, stating, "when 
we appeared for court on August 23rd and the day we received the summons . . . ."  Geddings also acknowledged that he and Sudaria 
were aware of the September 5, 2017 date, explaining they told 
the judge in the Small Claims case that the September 5, 2017 
date "would create a hardship[.]"  Geddings stated, "we had 
explained to the judge, too, that the date of September 5th, we 
-- that would create a hardship on our -- on our work because we NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 
13 
 were already taking off time half of the month of September to 
go to the mainland for a wedding[.]" 
The Regular Claims court asked, "[b]ut you were also 
informed at that time about the date of September 5th for the 
answer[,]" and Geddings answered, "[y]eah, but we explained the 
reason why."  After clarifying that there were two separate 
cases, the Regular Claims court stated, "[a]nd you didn't show 
up for one of them[,]" to which Geddings replied "that was 
complete confusion.  And on the day that September 5th came we, 
-- if we were -- if it would have been explicitly explained that that was a necessary thing because we expressed a hardship on 
that, that taking off that, because we -- we had taken so many 
days off beforehand . . . ." 
The court minutes for the Small Claims case also 
support the Regular Claims court's finding that Sudaria and 
Geddings were told of the September 5, 2017 date.  The 
August 23, 2017 court minutes for the hearing stated, "MRS SHIROMA REPRESENTED THAT SHE AND MR SHIROMA REPRESENT SNEZANA 
PIRSLIN AND THAT THERE IS A DAMAGES CLAIM AGAINST PLTFFS SET ON 
9/5/17 10B."  (Emphasis added.)  With no mention of the summons, 
the court minutes for the October 25, 2017 hearing show that 
Sudaria and Geddings claimed they were not served the complaint 
but the court minutes stated, "DURING RECESS COURT REVIEWED FILE NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 
14 
 FROM CASE 1RC17-1-4580, AND DETERMINED THAT DEFTS WERE SERVED 
AND SECURITY DEPOSIT ISSUE WAS RESOLVED." 
Based on the record in this case, and the court 
minutes in the Small Claims case, the finding that Sudaria and 
Geddings were told of the September 5, 2017 answer date was not 
clearly erroneous. 
With this finding, we cannot say that Sudaria and 
Geddings were deprived of due process.  Instead, the record 
shows that they were apprised of the Regular Claims case and the 
September 5, 2017 date to answer in that case.   
B. As To DCRCP Rule 55 And BDM, Denying The Motion To Set 
Aside Was An Abuse Of Discretion 
 
Again relying on their assertion that they did not 
receive page two of the summons, Sudaria and Geddings argue that 
the Regular Claims court "erred by denying [their] Motion to set 
aside the entry of default pursuant to DCRCP 55(c)[,]" and that 
they satisfied the three BDM factors. 
"A civil action is commenced by the filing of a 
complaint . . . ."  DCRCP Rule 3.  "Upon the filing of a 
complaint the clerk shall forthwith issue a summons.  Plaintiff 
shall deliver the complaint and summons to a person authorized to serve process."  DCRCP Rule 4(a).  
The summons must "be directed to the defendant," 
"state the time within which these rules require the defendant NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 
15 
 to appear and defend, and shall notify the defendant that in 
case of defendant's failure to do so judgment by default will be 
rendered against the defendant for the relief demanded in the 
complaint," and "contain a warning to the person summoned that 
failure to obey the summons may result in an entry of default 
and default judgment."  DCRCP Rule 4(b).  
"All defendants shall appear or answer at the time 
appointed in the summons, on the second Monday following the 
date of service . . . ."  DCRCP Rule 12(a) (emphasis added). 
"When a party against whom a judgment for affirmative 
relief is sought has failed to plead or otherwise defend as provided by these rules, and the fact is made to appear by 
affidavit or otherwise, the clerk shall enter that party's 
default."  DCRCP Rule 55(a).  For a default judgment by the 
court, a party entitled to the default judgment "shall apply to 
the court therefor."  DCRCP Rule 55(b)(2). 
In BDM, the Hawai‘ i Supreme Court articulated the 
standard for granting a motion to set aside entry of default or default judgment.  57 Haw. at 77, 549 P.2d at 1150.   
In general, a motion to set aside a default entry or a 
default judgment may and should be granted whenever the 
court finds (1) that the nondefaulting party will not be 
prejudiced by the reopening, (2) that the defaulting party 
has a meritorious defense, and (3) that the default was not 
the result of inexcusable neglect or a wil[l]ful act.  
Id.  Though Chen v. Mah prospectively abrogated this standard,
the supreme court held decisions prior to January 30, 2020 on  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 
16 
 motions to set aside an entry of default would still be reviewed 
under the three-prong test outlined in BDM.  Chen, 146 Hawai‘ i at 
177, 177 n.21, 457 P.3d at 816, 816 n.21.  Additionally, "if a 
moving party fails to establish any prong of the test, it is not an abuse of discretion to refuse to set aside the default."  146 
Hawai
‘i at 170, 457 P.3d at 809 (brackets omitted) (citing 
Citicorp Mortg., Inc. v. Bartolome, 94 Hawai‘ i 422, 439, 16 P.3d 
827, 844 (App. 2000)). 
Regarding the first BDM factor, Property Center 
acknowledged to the Regular Claims court that "there will be no 
undue prejudice by setting aside the default judgment."  
As for the second BDM factor, Sudaria and Geddings 
argue they have a meritorious defense because there was no 
property condition form.  Hawaii Revised Statutes § 521-42 
(2018) provides in part that 
Prior to the initial date of initial occupancy, the 
landlord shall inventory the premises and make a written 
record detailing the condition of the premises and any 
furnishings or appliances provided.  Duplicate copies of 
this inventory shall be signed by the landlord and by the tenant and a copy given to each tenant.  In an action 
arising under this section, the executed copy of the 
inventory shall be presumed to be correct.  If the landlord 
fails to make such an inventory and written record, the 
condition of the premises and any furnishings or appliances 
provided, upon the termination of the tenancy shall be 
rebuttably presumed to be the same as when the tenant first 
occupied the premises. 
 
(Emphasis added.)    
The record on appeal contains no property condition 
form.  Thus, the presumption is that the condition of the NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 
17 
 property at the end of the rental agreement was the same as when 
the tenants first occupied the property pursuant to the 
agreement.  See Sasaki v. Morisako, 112 Hawai‘ i 302, 309, 145 
P.3d 845, 852 (App. 2006) (explaining that, without the required 
inventory form, "the condition of the property at the 
termination of the oral rental agreement was presumed to be the 
same as when Appellants first occupied the property pursuant to 
the oral agreement").   
Although Property Center argues it rebutted this 
presumption with receipts and photos, it appears the presumption 
in favor of the tenant could be a meritorious defense in this 
case.  To the extent the Regular Claims court found Sudaria and 
Geddings failed to show they had a meritorious defense, that finding was clearly erroneous.   
Finally, as for the third factor, Sudaria and Geddings 
argue that "the default occurred when [they] were not notified 
of the hearing date and time."  Contrary to their argument, and 
as discussed above, the record reflects that Geddings 
acknowledged they were notified of the answer date and time for 
the Regular Claims case.  Also discussed above, the finding that Sudaria and Geddings were apprised of the answer date was not 
clearly erroneous.  
However, Sudaria and Geddings had no attorney, 
actively litigated the Small Claims case, explained to the Small NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 
18 
 Claims court the hardship regarding the Regular Claims case 
answer date, and explained to the Regular Claims court that they 
thought (albeit incorrectly) the continuance in the Small Claims 
case also applied to the Regular Claims case.  Given their self-
represented status and the simultaneous cases, it appears 
Sudaria and Geddings were understandably confused by the court

We pause here to emphasize "that defaults and default 
judgments are not favored and that any doubt should be resolved 
in favor of the party seeking relief, so that, in the interests 
of justice, there can be a full trial on the merits."  BDM, 57 
Haw. at 76, 549 P.2d at 1150 (emphases added).  In other words, 
any doubt as to whether the failure to appear on September 5, 
2017 was due to inexcusable neglect or a willful act should have 
been resolved in favor of Sudaria and Geddings.  See generally, 
57 Haw. at 76, 77, 549 P.2d at 1150.  The court, however, made no mention of how this reasoning factored in its ruling, and made no credibility determination.   
Thus, to the extent the Regular Claims court found 
that Sudaria and Geddings failed to meet their burden of proving 
their non-appearance was not due to inexcusable neglect or a 
willful act, we are "left with the definite and firm conviction 
in reviewing the entire evidence that a mistake has been 
committed."  Bhakta, 109 Hawai‘ i at 208, 124 P.3d at 953.     NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 Accordingly, based on the particular circumstances in 
this case, we hold that the Regular Claims court's denial of 
Sudaria and Geddings's motion to set aside the entry of default 
was an abuse of discretion, and must be vacated.  Because the 
default judgment was based on the entry of default, it must also 
be vacated.   
IV. CONCLUSION 
In conclusion, we vacate the Regular Claims court's 
(1) December 26, 2017 Denial of Defendants' Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment and Stay Garnishment and (2) January 29, 2018 Order Denying Defendants' Motion to Set Aside Default, Judgment 
and Stay Garnishment (Filed December 8, 2017), and remand this 
case for further proceedings consistent with this memorandum 
opinion.
