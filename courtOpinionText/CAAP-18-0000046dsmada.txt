CRAIG A. GOMES, Claimant-Appellant/Appellant, 
v.
HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC CO., INC., 
Employer-Appellee/Appellee,
and
ADMINISTRATOR, DISABILITY COMPENSATION DIVISION, 
and DIRECTOR, DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(Civil No. 17-1-1327)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
AND DISMISSING ALL PENDING MOTIONS AS MOOT
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
Upon review of the record on appeal, it appears that we
lack appellate jurisdiction over the appeal by Claimant/
Appellant/Appellant Craig A. Gomes (Gomes), pro se, from the
Honorable Keith K. Hiraoka's two December 26, 2017 orders of
dismissal in Civil No. 17-1-1327-08, because the circuit court has
not yet adjudicated all of the substantive issues and entered a
corresponding appealable final judgment.
After a party such as Gomes participates in an
administrative appellate case in a circuit court under Hawaii
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 91-14(b) (2012 & Supp. 2017), the
"[r]eview of any final judgment of the circuit court or, ifNOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
applicable, the environmental court, under this chapter shall be
governed by chapter 602."  HRS § 91-15 (2012 & Supp. 2017).  The
Hawai#i Intermediate Court of Appeals has jurisdiction "[t]o hear
and determine appeals from any court or agency when appeals are
allowed by law[.]"  HRS § 602-57(1) (2016).  "Appeals shall be
allowed in civil matters from all final judgments, orders, or
decrees of circuit . . . courts[.]"  HRS § 641-1(a) (2016). 
Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . .
provided by the rules of court."  HRS § 641-1(c) (2016).  In a
civil circuit court case, Rule 58 of the Hawai #i Rules of Civil
Procedure (HRCP) requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth
on a separate document."  Consequently, under HRCP Rule 58 and the
holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai #i
115, 869 P.2d 1334 (1994), an aggrieved party may appeal from a
civil circuit court case pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a) only after the
circuit court reduces its dispositive rulings to a separate
judgment.  Similarly, HRCP Rule 72(k)1 requires that, upon a
circuit court's determination of an administrative appeal, "the
court having jurisdiction shall enter judgment."  Consequently, the
separate judgment document rule also applies to an administrative
appeal before a circuit court.  See, e.g., Raquinio v. Nakanelua,
77 Hawai #i 499, 500, 889 P.2d 76, 77 (App. 1995) ("We conclude . .
. that the requirements for appealability set forth in Jenkins
apply to appeals from circuit court orders deciding appeals from
orders entered by the Director of Labor and Industrial
Relations.").  Under the separate judgment document rule, "an order
is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the
parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." 
Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai #i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 
1/ Rule 81(e) of the Hawai #i Rules of Civil Procedure requires that
the Hawai #i Rules of Civil Procedure "shall apply to any proceedings in a
circuit court pursuant to appeal to the circuit court from a governmental
official or body (other than a court), except as otherwise provided in Rule
72."

(2008); Bailey v. DuVauchelle, 135 Hawai #i 482, 489, 353 P.3d 1024,
1031 (2015).  In the absence of a separate judgment document, the
two December 26, 2017 orders of dismissal are not yet eligible for
appellate review, and we lack appellate jurisdiction.
Pursuant to HRS § 602-57(3) (2016) and the holding in
Waikiki v. Ho #omaka Village Association of Apartment Owners, 140
Hawai#i 197, 204, 398 P.3d 786, 793 (2017), this court entered a
June 27, 2018 order temporarily remanding this case to the
circuit court with instructions for the circuit court to enter
either (a) an appealable final judgment that resolves all claims as
to all parties or (b) a written order explaining why it is not
possible or appropriate for the circuit court to do so.  On
June 28, 2018, the circuit court entered an order explaining that
it is not yet appropriate for the circuit court to enter an
appealable final judgment in Civil No. 17-1-1327-08, because a
cause of action by Gomes for declaratory relief under HRS § 91-7
(2012 & Supp. 2017) is still unresolved and pending before the
circuit court.  
Without a final judgment, we currently lack appellate
jurisdiction under HRS § 91-15, HRS § 602-57(1), HRS § 641-1(a),
HRCP Rule 72(k) and the holdings in Raquinio and Jenkins.  After
the circuit court adjudicates Gomes's remaining cause of action for
declaratory relief in Civil No. 17-1-1327-08, Gomes will be
entitled to appellate review of the two December 26, 2017 orders of
dismissal by way of a timely appeal from the circuit court's future
final judgment, because "[a]n appeal from a final judgment brings
up for review all interlocutory orders not appealable directly as
of right which deal with issues in the case."  Ueoka v Szymanski,
107 Hawai #i 386, 396, 114 P.3d 892, 902 (2005) (citation and
internal quotation marks omitted).  Gomes's current appeal is
premature.
