APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 15-1-1958)
ORDER
DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK APPELLATE JURISDICTION
AND
DISMISSING AS MOOT ALL PENDING MOTIONS IN CAAP-18-0000052 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Chan, JJ.)
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
appellate jurisdiction over Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/
Appellant Lillian M. Jones's (Dr. Jones), pro se, appeal from the
Honorable James H. Ashford's December 29, 2017 summary judgment
order and the Honorable Rhonda A. Nishimura's April 19, 2017
order of dismissal in Civil No. 15-1-001958.
An aggrieved party cannot obtain appellate review of a
circuit court's dispositive orders in a civil case pursuant to
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-1(a)(2016) until the circuit
court reduces the dispositive orders to a final judgment as toNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
all claims and parties pursuant to Rule 58 of the Hawai #i Rules
of Civil Procedure (HRCP).  See Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming
& Wright, 76 Hawai# i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994).
"[B]ased on Jenkins  and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable,
even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has
been reduced to a separate judgment."  Carlisle v. One (1) Boat ,
119 Hawai# i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008).  The circuit
court has not yet reduced its dispositive rulings to a separate
judgment, and, thus, the appealed orders are interlocutory and
ineligible for appellate review at this time.
The Supreme Court of Hawaii recently held that, when
the record on appeal indicates that the circuit court has
resolved all claims against all parties, and the only thing
lacking to perfect an aggrieved party's right to obtain appellate
review is the entry of an appealable final judgment, the Hawai# i
Intermediate Court of Appeals should invoke HRS ยง 602-57(3)
(2016), and temporarily remand the case to the circuit court with
instructions to enter, and supplement the record on appeal with,
an appealable final judgment as to all claims and parties. 
Waikiki v. Ho# omaka Village Association of Apartment Owners , 140
Hawai#i 197, 204, 398 P.3d 786, 793 (2017).  However, the holding
in Waikiki  is distinguishable, because the circuit court in the
instant case has not yet adjudicated Defendant/Counterclaim-
Plaintiff/Appellee Hawai #i Medical Board's counterclaim against
Dr. Jones, which is still pending before the circuit court. 
Where, as here, the record on appeal does not indicate that the
circuit court has resolved all claims as to all parties, a
temporary remand with instructions to enter an appealable final
judgment on all claims (including the unresolved claims) is
neither warranted nor authorized under HRS ยง 602-57(3) and the
holding in Waikiki .  In the absence of an appealable final
judgment as to all claims and parties, Dr. Jones's appeal is
premature and we lack appellate jurisdiction.#
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
case number CAAP-18-0000052 is dismissed for lack of appellate
jurisdiction.

IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions
in appellate court case number CAAP-18-0000052 are dismissed as
moot.
