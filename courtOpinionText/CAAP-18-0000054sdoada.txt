STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v. 
DESTINY M. KELLY, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CR. NO. 1CPC-17-0000093) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Chan and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Destiny M. Kelly (Kelly) appeals 
from the Judgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence, filed on 
September 5, 2017, and the Order Denying Motion to Reconsider 
Sentence, filed on January 26, 2018, in the Circuit Court of the 
First Circuit (Circuit Court). 1
After pleading guilty, Kelly was convicted of 
Unauthorized Control of Propelled Vehicle (UCPV), in violation of
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 708-836 (2014).  Over Kelly's 2 
1 The Honorable Edwin C. Nacino presided. 
2 HRS § 708-836 states, in relevant part: 
§708-836 Unauthorized control of propelled vehicle.
(1) A person commits the offense of unauthorized control of
a propelled vehicle if the person intentionally or knowingly
exerts unauthorized control over another's propelled vehicleby operating the vehicle without the owner's consent or bychanging the identity of the vehicle without the owner'sconsent. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
objection, Kelly was ordered to pay restitution of $5,021.76 to 
the Complaining Witness (CW) as part of her sentence. Kelly's 
motion to reconsider the imposition of restitution was also 
denied. 
On appeal, Kelly claims the Circuit Court erred by (1) 
imposing restitution because Kelly's conduct was not the cause of 
the CW's loss and the request for restitution was not reasonable 
and verified, and (2) failing to consider Kelly's ability to pay 
when setting the time and manner of payment, in violation of HRS 
§ 706-646(3) (Supp. 2017). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we 
resolve Kelly's points of error as follows: 
(1) As a preliminary matter, we note that Kelly's 
appeal from the September 5, 2017 Judgment of Conviction and 
Probation Sentence was untimely. "In a criminal case, the notice 
of appeal shall be filed within 30 days after entry of the 
judgment or order appealed from." Hawai# i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure Rule 4(b)(1). 
A motion to reduce sentence, pursuant to 
Rule 35 of the Hawai# i Rules of Penal Procedure, is not a tolling 
motion. State v. Stone, No. SCWC-30059, 2014 WL 820272, at *5-6 
(Haw. Feb. 28, 2014) (mem. op.). 
Kelly filed a Notice of Appeal 
on January 30, 2018, more than 30 days after the September 5, 2017 Judgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence. Therefore, 
the appeal was untimely. "[C]ompliance with the requirement of 
the timely filing of a notice of appeal is jurisdictional." 
State v. Brandimart, 68 Haw. 495, 496, 720 P.2d 1009, 1010 
(1986). 
"In criminal cases, [the supreme court] ha[s] made 
exceptions to the requirement that notices of appeal be timely 
(2) "Propelled vehicle" means an automobile,
airplane, motorcycle, motorboat, or other motor-propelled
vehicle. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
filed." State v. Irvine, 88 Hawai# i 404, 407, 967 P.2d 236, 239 
(1998). 
The recognized exceptions include "circumstances 
where . . . defense counsel has inexcusably or ineffectively 
failed to pursue a defendant's appeal from a criminal conviction 
in the first instance[.]" Id. (citation omitted). 
Counsel for Kelly admitted he inexcusably or 
ineffectively failed to timely file a notice of appeal from the 
September 5, 2017 Judgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence. 
Therefore, this court will exercise jurisdiction over Kelly's 
appeal from the September 5, 2017 Judgment of Conviction and 
Probation Sentence. 
Kelly contends the Circuit Court erred by imposing 
restitution because Kelly's conduct was not the cause of the CW's 
loss. 
Kelly claims she did not cause the CW's loss because she 
was convicted of UCPV, which entailed only intentional or knowing unauthorized control of the CW's vehicle without her consent. 
Thus, Kelly claims there was no evidence she caused any damage to 
the CW's vehicle by operating it without consent. 
In State v. Domingo, 121 Hawai# i 191, 195, 216 P.3d 
117, 121 (App. 2009), this court reversed the trial court's 
imposition of restitution upon a defendant related to a 
decedent's death. 
The defendant, Freddy Domingo (Domingo), was 
convicted of Accidents Involving Death or Serious Bodily Injury for failing to remain at the scene of an accident, failing to 
give information, and failing to render reasonable assistance. 
Id. at 192, 216 P.3d at 118. 
Over Domingo's objection that he 
did not cause the loss suffered by the decedent, the Circuit Court ordered him to pay restitution of $13,225.94 for funeral 
expenses, a gravestone, and an ambulance fee. Id. at 193, 216 
P.3d at 119. This court held that, because the decedent caused his own death and died at the scene, there was no causal 
relationship between Domingo's conduct and the decedent's losses. 
Id. at 195, 216 P.3d at 121. This court stated: "Absent evidence 
that Domingo's conduct caused or aggravated [the decedent's] 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
injuries or caused [the decedent's] death, no causal relationship 
between Domingo's criminal act and a victim's losses is shown and 
restitution may not be imposed pursuant to HRS § 706-646." Id. 
Kelly's argument that any loss outside the scope of the 
statutory elements of an offense precludes causation of loss is 
without merit. It is true that damage or loss of property is not 
an element of UCPV. However, in State v. Foumai, No. CAAP-17-
0000093, 2018 WL 495679, at *2 (Haw. App. Jan. 22, 2018) (mem. 
op.), this court found a defendant convicted of Burglary in the 
Second Degree, in violation of HRS § 708-811 (2014), was the 
cause of losses for items missing from the premises he 
burglarized despite the fact that taking of property is not an 
element of Burglary in the Second Degree. Citing State v. 
Phillips, 138 Hawai# i 321, 352, 382 P.3d 133, 164 (2016), this 
court noted that the defendant's conduct need not be the whole or only conduct to bring about the losses, and that only a nexus is 
required. Foumai, 2018 WL 495679, at *2. This court held there 
was sufficient evidence presented that the defendant took the missing items, based upon statements from the owners that the 
items were in their desks prior to the burglary, to demonstrate 
there was a causal relationship or nexus to establish the 
defendant caused the losses. Id. at *3. 
Contrary to Kelly's claim, HRS § 708-836 currently does 
not merely seek to punish a defendant for operating a vehicle for 
a "joyride"; the statute was amended to prohibit unauthorized 
control of a vehicle. Compare Commentary on HRS § 708-836, with 
Supplementary Commentary on HRS § 708-836. As in Foumai, it need not be shown that Kelly's conduct was the whole or only conduct 
that caused all of the damage or loss or that the type of losses 
claimed for purposes of restitution falls squarely within the 
elements of the crime for which she is convicted. When Kelly 
assumed control of the CW's vehicle, the CW lost the ability to 
guard against loss or damage to the vehicle and its content. 
Kelly was responsible for any damage or loss to the vehicle or 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
its content while it was in her control. In this case, the 
police incident report indicated that, when Kelly was pulled 
over, "the stereo was missing . . . . The vehicle was sprayed 
with red spray paint and the hood was spray painted black." 
Thus, Kelly is not precluded, as a matter of law, from being 
found to be the cause of the CW's losses due to her conviction 
for UCPV. 
Kelly also contends the losses were not reasonable and 
verified because: original receipts were not submitted, a list 
detailing the original content and condition of the vehicle was 
not provided, there was no showing that expenses were actually 
paid to fix or replace damages or losses, estimates were used to 
justify the costs of some repairs or replacement items instead of 
showing actual payment, and the fair market value for replacement 
of the entire vehicle was substantially less than the restitution 
requested to cover repairs and replacement items. 
HRS § 706-646 states, in relevant part: 
(2) The court shall order the defendant to make 
restitution for reasonable and verified losses suffered by
the victim or victims as a result of the defendant's offense when requested by the victim. . . . 
(3) In ordering restitution, the court shall not
consider the defendant's financial ability to makerestitution in determining the amount of restitution toorder. The court, however, shall consider the defendant'sfinancial ability to make restitution for the purpose ofestablishing the time and manner of payment. The court shall specify the time and manner in which restitution is tobe paid. While the defendant is in the custody of thedepartment of public safety, restitution shall be collectedpursuant to chapter 353 and any court-ordered paymentschedule shall be suspended. Restitution shall be a dollar amount that is sufficient to reimburse any victim fully forlosses, including but not limited to: 
(a) Full value of stolen or damaged property, asdetermined by replacement costs of likeproperty, or the actual or estimated cost ofrepair, if repair is possible[.] 
HRS § 706-646 does not require original receipts be 
provided to establish a loss was suffered. Estimated repair 
costs are expressly permitted to demonstrate losses that are 
subject to restitution. Thus, the CW was permitted to rely upon 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
estimated repair costs as part of her restitution request. There 
is no statutory requirement to demonstrate only actual payment. 
Requiring actual payment would negate the express statutory 
language of HRS § 706-646(3)(a) that allows use of the estimated 
cost of repair. 
Kelly's argument that losses are limited to the fair 
market replacement value is not supported by the plain language 
of HRS § 706-646(3). HRS § 706-646(3) states: "Restitution shall 
be a dollar amount that is sufficient to reimburse any victim 
fully for losses," including the full value of damaged property, 
which can be determined by either "the replacement costs of like 
property, or the actual or estimated cost of repair, if repair is 
possible." HRS § 706-646(3) does not limit restitution to the 
lesser of the replacement or repair cost when repair is possible. 
In this case, the CW claimed repair was possible and requested 
restitution for the repair cost. Restitution was not limited to 
the fair market value of a replacement vehicle. 
Kelly's foregoing arguments are questions of law 
involving the statutory interpretation of HRS § 706-646. 
However, Kelly's claim that the CW failed to adequately specify 
the damage or loss to the vehicle or its content is a challenge 
to the reasonableness or veracity of the restitution request. In 
State v. Demello, 130 Hawai# i 332, 310 P.3d 1033 (App. 2013), 
vacated in part on other grounds, 136 Hawai# i 193, 361 P.3d 420 
(2015), this court described the burden shifting nature involved 
in a restitution proceeding. 
We held that the prosecution had 
the initial burden to present a prima facie showing that the restitution request is "reasonable and verified" by providing 
information regarding and verification of the victim's losses 
caused by the defendant. Id. at 344, 310 P.3d at 1045. 
If a 
defendant contests the request, the defendant must come forward with evidence to support his or her challenge. Id. "This 
process will allow both a defendant and victim the opportunity to litigate their interests while still maintaining the 'fast track' 
6  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
contemplated by the Legislature." Id. at 345, 310 P.3d at 1046. 
Here, the Circuit Court did not make a finding that Kelly was the 
cause of the CW's losses and that the losses were sufficiently 
verified and reasonable. On this record, a finding is necessary 
to determine whether, and to what extent, the State made a prima 
facie showing that Kelly was the cause of the losses and the 
losses were reasonable and verified. It was premature to impose 
restitution as part of Kelly's sentence without making such a 
finding. 
(2) Kelly contends the Circuit Court did not comply 
with HRS § 706-646(3)3 by failing to make findings considering 
Kelly's financial ability to pay $30 per month in restitution based on her employment, income, lack of assets, and entry into a 
long term residential substance abuse treatment program. The 
State concedes the case should be remanded for findings to 
adequately determine the time and manner of restitution payments. 
The Circuit Court was required to make oral or written 
findings and conclusions regarding Kelly's financial ability to 
pay when setting the time and manner of restitution payments. 
HRS §§ 706-605(7) (2014), 706-646(3); State v. Gaylord, 78 
Hawai# i 127, 153, 890 P.2d 1167, 1193 (1995); State v. Curioso, 
No. CAAP-13-0001014, 2014 WL 1271038, at *2-3 (Haw. App. Mar. 28, 2014) (SDO). In this case, the Circuit Court did not make any 
oral or written findings and conclusions on the record regarding 
Kelly's ability to pay restitution when setting the time and 
manner of the payments. 
3 HRS § 706-646(3) provides, in relevant part: 
(3) In ordering restitution, the court shall
not consider the defendant's financial ability to make
restitution in determining the amount of restitutionto order. The court, however, shall consider thedefendant's financial ability to make restitution forthe purpose of establishing the time and manner ofpayment. The court shall specify the time and mannerin which restitution is to be paid.
