LEE KI BOYD, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI#I, Respondent-Appellee
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CASE NO. 1SD17-1-00002)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, and Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
Petitioner-Appellant Lee Ki Boyd appeals from the
January 3, 2018 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order
Denying Rule 40 Petition for Post Conviction Relief ("Order")
entered by the District Court of the First Circuit ("District
Court")./  The Order denied Boyd's 1Hawai#i Rules of Penal
Procedure ("HRPP") Rule 40 Petition for Post Conviction Relief
("Petition"), in which Boyd challenged his conviction for
Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant
("OVUII"),/ in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS")
291E-61(a)(1) (Supp. 2014),/ and sought to have the case
dismissed or set for a new trial. 32
1/The Honorable Darolyn H. Lendio Heim presided in the Rule 40 post
conviction proceedings.
2/The Honorable David W. Lo presided in the underlying OVUII
proceedings.  For clarity, the proceedings associated with Judge Lo are
referred to as the "trial court," while the proceedings associated with Judge
Lendio Heim as the "District Court." 
3/The statute provides: "A person commits the offense of operating a
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates or assumes
actual physical control of a vehicle: (1) While under the influence of alcohol
in an amount sufficient to impair the person's normal mental faculties or
ability to care for the person and guard against casualty[.]"  Haw. Rev. Stat.
§ 291E-61(a)(1).NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
On May 29 and June 23, 2015, the trial court conducted
a bench trial in the underlying case, in which Honolulu Police
Department Officer James Yee testified with regard to Boyd's
performance on the horizontal gaze nystagmus test, the "walk-and-
turn" test, and the "one-leg stand" test./  The trial court
found Boyd guilty as charged, and convicted him of OVUII. 4
On July 16, 2015, Boyd filed a notice of appeal to this
court.  In State v. Boyd, No. CAAP-15-0000528,/ 2016 WL 3369242
(Haw. Ct. App. June 15, 2016), this court vacated Boyd's
conviction for OVUII under HRS section 291E-61(a)(3), and
affirmed Boyd's conviction under HRS section 291E-61(a)(1).  We
held that Officer Yee's testimony represented substantial
evidence to establish that Boyd "operated or assumed actual
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of
alcohol in an amount sufficient to impair a person's normal
mental faculties or ability to care for the person and guard
against casualty in violation of HRS § 291E61(a)(1)." 5
Boyd filed an Application for Writ of Certiorari, which
the Hawai#i Supreme Court rejected on September 19, 2016.   See
State v. Boyd, No. SCWC-15-0000528, 2016 WL 4990250 (Haw. Sept.
19, 2016).6/
On June 19, 2017, Boyd filed his Petition with the
District Court.  Boyd alleged in relevant part that, prior to his
trial, Officer Yee was "prosecuted by the Honolulu Prosecuting
Attorney for Shoplifting"; that the State failed to disclose
Officer Yee's prosecution in violation of Boyd's rights under
Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), "as this information would
4/Boyd requests that this court take judicial notice of the records
and files in that case.  The Hawai #i Supreme Court has "validated the practice
of taking judicial notice of a court's own records in an interrelated
proceeding where the parties are the same."  State v. Akana , 68 Haw. 164, 165,
706 P.2d 1300, 1302 (1985) (citing State v. Wong , 50 Haw. 42, 43, 430 P.2d
330, 332 (1967)).  Accordingly, we take judicial notice of the records and
files in Case No. 1DTA-15-01335.
5/Both the Respondent-Appellee State of Hawai #i ("State") and Boyd
request that this court take judicial notice of the records and files in that
case.  For reasons explained above, we take judicial notice of the records and
files in appellate case No. CAAP-15-0000528.
6/Boyd requests that this court take judicial notice of the records
and files in that case.  For reasons explained above, we take judicial notice
of the records and files in appellate case No. SCWC-15-0000528.

have been favorable to [Boyd], giving [him] the opportunity to
cross examine [Officer] Yee on the favorable materials pursuant
to Hawaii Rules of Evidence Rule 608(b) [regarding specific
instances of conduct going to witness credibility] and other
statutory provisions"; and that, therefore, Boyd's state and
federal due process rights were violated, and his conviction
should be reversed, and the case dismissed and/or set for a new
trial.  
On July 12, 2017, the State filed its answer to Boyd's
Petition.  The State denied Boyd's allegation in the Petition
that prior to trial in the underlying case, "[Officer] Yee was
prosecuted by the Honolulu Prosecuting Attorney for
Shoplifting,"  but acknowledged that7/
According to records in JIMS, James Yee was charged with one
count of Theft in the Fourth Degree under Case No.
1P2100000463 with HPD Report No. 10437532 in the District
court of [] the First Circuit, Wahiawa Division.
a.A&P was January 4, 2011
b.On May 19, 2011 James Yee was represented by Guy
Matsunaga and entered a plea of no contest. He was
granted a deferred acceptance of no contest plea of
six months.
c.On October 11, 2011, his case was dismissed[.]
On August 28, 2017, the District Court granted Boyd a
continuance of the hearing on the Petition to subpoena both the
criminal and administrative investigations by HPD against Officer
Yee.  A Stipulated Protective Order was filed on September 12,
2017 along with a Filing of Police Documents Under Seal with the
subpoenaed documents.  The documents provided, in relevant part,
that on May 19, 2011, Officer Yee received a twenty-day
suspension for "Theft (Felony)" and a three-day suspension for
"Commission of a Criminal Act (Other) - Conviction for Theft,"
that the incident took place on December 7, 2010, and that the
incident involved Officer Yee walking into a supermarket,
concealing poi, honey, and meat in his pants, and exiting the
store without paying for the concealed items.
7/The State provides no argument on the subject of whether, because
the Prosecutor's Office did not prosecute Officer Yee, it was unaware of the
prosecution so as to excuse its responsibility to produce information under
Brady.  Therefore, we do not consider the matter further.
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
On November 6, 2017, the continued-hearing on the
Petition took place.  On January 3, 2018, the District Court
entered the Order denying the Petition.  In the Order, the
District Court made the following conclusion of law, which Boyd
now challenges: "5.  The Court finds that [Boyd] failed to show
that the shoplifting offense by Officer Yee carries probative
value on the issue of the truth and veracity of [Officer] Yee as
a witness against [Boyd] in [Boyd's] OVUII trial."  
On appeal, Boyd asserts that:  (1) The State's wilful
withholding of the information surrounding Officer Yee's
shoplifting prosecution constituted a Brady violation; and (2)
had the State disclosed Officer Yee's prosecution, the discovery
that records had been purged would have led to the exclusion of
Officer Yee as a witness.  
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
the arguments they advance and the issues they raise, as well as
the relevant statutory and case law, we affirm.
(1) Boyd argues that the State's wilful withholding of
the information surrounding Officer Yee's shoplifting prosecution
constituted a Brady violation because, had it been brought to
Boyd's attention prior to trial, he could have used such
information to impeach Officer Yee.
In extending Brady to impeachment evidence, the Hawai# i
Supreme Court has articulated that "[t]he duty to disclose
evidence that is favorable to the accused includes evidence that
may be used to impeach the government's witnesses by showing
bias, self-interest, or other factors that might undermine the
reliability of the witness's testimony."  Birano v. State , 143
Hawai#i 163, 182, 426 P.3d 387, 406 (2018) (citing Giglio v.
United States, 405 U.S. 150, 154 (1972)).  "The duty to disclose
material impeachment evidence is compelled not only by due
process, but also the constitutional right to confrontation." 
Birano, 143 Hawai#i at 183, 426 P.3d at 407. 
"Violation of the constitutional right to confront
adverse witnesses is subject to the harmless beyond a
reasonable doubt standard."  Additionally, the failure of
the prosecution to disclose impeachment evidence warrants a
new trial if the evidence is " material ."  When the
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
"reliability of a given witness may well be determinative of
guilt or innocence," the nondisclosure of evidence affecting
that witness's credibility is material.  Put another way,
evidence is material "if there is a reasonable probability
that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the
result of the proceeding would have been different."  Thus,
the nondisclosure of impeachment evidence bearing on [a
witness'] credibility warrants granting [a defendant] a new
trial if [the witness'] testimony was material in the
obtainment of [the defendant's] convictions.
Birano, 143 Hawai#i at 190–91, 426 P.3d at 414–15 (emphasis
added) (citations omitted).
Relying on State v. Pacheco , 96 Hawai#i 83, 26 P.3d 572
(2001), the District Court concluded that because of the nature
of Officer Yee's offense, there was no reasonable probability
that, had the information been disclosed, the result of the
proceeding could have been any different: 
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
1.[Boyd] comes before this court seeking relief pursuant
to HRPP Rule 40, essentially alleging that the State failed
to notify counsel of the prosecution of [Officer] Yee and as
such violated Brady, and in turn violated his State and
Federal Rights to Due Process. 
2.Specifically, [Boyd] claims that had the State
provided information regarding Officer Yee's prosecution of
shoplifting, he would have used that information to impeach
Officer Yee, State's witness in his OVUII trial,  relating to
truthfulness or credibility .
3.A petty theft conviction is not, per se, a "crime of
dishonesty," such that it is admissible for impeachment
purposes . State v. Pacheco, 96 Hawaii 83, 98, 26 P.3d 572,
587 (2001).
. . . .
5.The Court finds that [Boyd] failed to show that the
shoplifting offense by Officer Yee carries probative value
on the issue of the truth and veracity of [Officer] Yee as a
witness against [Boyd] in [Boyd's] OVUII trial.
(Emphasis added.)      
In Pacheco , the Hawai#i Supreme Court held that the
trial court erred in allowing the prosecution to introduce the
defendant's prior theft conviction for impeachment purposes under
Hawaii Rules of Evidence ("HRE") Rule 609(a).   96 8/Hawai#i at 99,
8/The District Court indicated during the November 6, 2017 hearing
on the Petition that it considered the analysis under HRE Rule 608(b), and
COLs 2 and 5 reflect the same.  As HRE Rule 609(a) and HRE Rule 608(b) both
concern the employment of impeachment evidence to attack a witness's
credibility on the basis of acts/crimes of untruthfulness /dishonesty, Pacheco
is applicable to this case. 
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
26 P.3d at 588.  The court noted that "[i]n every instance where
a witness is sought to be impeached, the only issue that arises
is whether the witness is telling the truth," and that as a
preliminary matter, "if a party proffers evidence of a prior
conviction to impeach the credibility of a witness, the trial
court must first expressly determine whether the proffering party
has 'shown that the conviction . . . rationally carries probative
value on the issue of the truth and veracity of the witness .'" 
Id. (emphasis added) (ellipses in original) (quoting Asato v.
Furtado, 52 Haw. 284, 292, 293, 474 P.2d 288, 294, 295 (1970)). 
The supreme court held that "a theft offense is not, per se , a
"crime of dishonesty" such that it is admissible to impeach a
criminal defendant's credibility.  Rather, to be admissible
impeachment evidence pursuant to HRE Rule 609(a), the defendant
must have committed the prior theft offense under circumstances
that, by their very nature, render his or her prior conviction of
the offense relevant to and probative of his or her veracity as a
witness."  Id. at 100, 26 P.3d at 589 (emphasis added) (citations
omitted).  
Taken together, the dispositive issue is whether the
information surrounding Officer Yee's shoplifting prosecution
constituted evidence that could be used to impeach Officer Yee by
showing bias, self-interest, or other factors—in this case, that
would be his credibility due to untruthfulness—that might
undermine the reliability of Officer Yee's testimony in Boyd's
OVUII trial.
Boyd argues that based on the circumstances surrounding
Officer Yee's shoplifting prosecution and the fact that "although
he was off duty at the time, Officer Yee was a sworn police
officer at the time that he stole the items[,]" Officer Yee
displayed non-verbal acts that were "deceptive," and therefore,
created a reasonable possibility that Officer Yee's testimony
"would have been put in a different light."  Boyd provides no
legal authority in support, and more importantly, fails to
explain why Officer Yee's actions were deceptive as to affect his
credibility as a witness or how the information would undermine
the reliability of Officer Yee's testimony in any way.  Rather,
6NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
Boyd simply reiterates the facts underlying Officer Yee's
shoplifting prosecution. 
The record also does not support Boyd's argument.  The
subpoenaed documents submitted with the September 12, 2017 Filing
of Police Documents Under Seal chronicle exactly what Boyd
describes.  They do not, however, reflect that Officer Yee's
four-year-old shoplifting incident had any probative value on the
truth and veracity of Officer Yee as a witness in Boyd's
unrelated OVUII trial.  See Pacheco , 96 Hawai#i at 100, 26 P.3d
at 589 (concluding that the prosecution failed to establish that
defendant's prior theft conviction, which it determined from the
record, at most, "involved 'shoplifting' from a 'church[,]'" was
conduct relevant to or probative of defendant's veracity as a
witness); see also id. (noting an example where "trial court
properly determined that nine-year-old theft conviction was not a
crime of dishonesty and, thus, was too 'collateral' and 'remote'
to be admissible to impeach prosecution's witness" (citing State
v. Pudiquet , 82 Hawai#i 419, 427, 922 P.2d 1032, 1040 (App.), 
cert. denied, 82 Hawai# i 360, 922 P.2d 973 (1996))). 
Moreover, the subpoenaed documents do not reflect bias,
self-interest, or any other factor that would undermine the
reliability of Officer Yee's testimony against Boyd.  The
documents do not reflect that Officer Yee had any personal stake
in Boyd's OVUII trial, or that Officer Yee's shoplifting
prosecution, which occurred more than four years prior to Boyd's
OVUII offense, undermined Officer Yee's credibility as a witness
such that it affected the reliability of Officer Yee's testimony. 
Cf. Birano, 143 Hawai#i at 181-89, 426 P.3d at 405-13 (holding
that the trial court erred in concluding that there was no
impeachment evidence that required disclosure because the
evidence was relevant to witnesses' credibility as it showed that
he was "motivated by the possibility of a reward from the State,"
in the form of a sentencing recommendation, in exchange for
testifying against defendant).  Put another way, there is no
reasonable probability that had Officer Yee's shoplifting
prosecution been disclosed to Boyd, the result of Boyd's OVUII
trial would have been different.  See Birano, 143 Hawai#i at 191,
7NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
426 P.3d at 415 (noting that impeachment evidence is material,
thereby requiring disclosure by the prosecution, "'if there is a
reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to
the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been
different'" (quoting State v. Moriwaki, 71 Haw. 347, 356, 791
P.2d 392, 397 (1990))).
Therefore, the District Court correctly concluded that
"[Boyd] failed to show that the shoplifting offense by Officer
Yee carries probative value on the issue of the truth and
veracity of [Officer] Yee as a witness against [Boyd] in [Boyd's]
OVUII trial."  See State v. Ramos, 93 Hawai# i 502, 507, 6 P.3d
374, 379 (App. 2000) (stating that conclusions of law are
reviewed under the right/wrong standard (quoting State v.
Balberdi , 90 Hawai#i 16, 20-21, 975 P.2d 773, 777-78 (App.
1999))).  Accordingly, the State did not violate Brady in failing
at the time of Boyd's trial to disclose the subpoenaed documents
regarding Officer Yee's shoplifting prosecution.  Boyd's first
point is thus without merit. 
(2) Boyd also argues that the State's disclosure of
"the information on [Officer Yee], which would have led to the
information that HPD had purged the administrative discipline
against [Officer Yee] which resulted in a 3 day suspension for
theft, and a 20 day suspension for felony theft," would have led
to the exclusion of Officer Yee as a witness.
In State v. Matafeo , 71 Haw. 183, 787 P.2d 671 (1990),
the Hawai#i Supreme Court evaluated whether the loss or
destruction of potentially exculpatory evidence, consisting of
clothing in an alleged sexual assault, violated due process under
the Hawai#i Constitution and under Brady.  In holding that the
HPD's destruction of the evidence and the State's subsequent
failure to preserve the evidence did not violate defendant's due
process rights, the court adopted the rule that dismissal is
appropriate in certain circumstances, regardless of good or bad
faith, where the State loses or destroys material which is "so
critical to the defense as to make a criminal trial fundamentally
unfair without it."  Id. at 187, 787 P.2d at 673 (internal
quotation marks omitted) (quoting Arizona v. Youngblood , 488 U.S.
8NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
51, 61 (1988) (Stevens, J., concurring)).  Justice Wakatsuki,
concurring specially, agreed that the destruction of the evidence
did not demand dismissal of the charge.  Matafeo, 71 Haw. at 188-
189, 787 P.2d at 674 (Wakatsuki, J., concurring).  However,
Justice Wakatsuki opined that, in order to adequately protect
defendant's due process rights and encourage the police to
improve their procedures and practices in preserving evidence, he
would have remanded the case to the trial court with orders to
instruct the jury that "it may infer that the destroyed evidence
which was in the custody and control of the State would be
favorable to the defense against the State."  Id. at 189, 787
P.2d at 674 (Wakatsuki, J., concurring). 
Citing generally to the concurrence in Matafeo , Boyd
asserts that "[t]his court should make an inference that the
purged investigations would have been favorable to the defense,
since the defendant had absolutely no control over either the
destruction, or notification of the existence of the documents
that were purged."  Boyd further asserts that "by not disclosing
the prosecution of [Officer] Yee, the State suppressed favorable
information since it is likely to have excluded [Officer] Yee
from testifying as a result of the presumptively prejudicial
information that was purged by HPD."
Boyd's arguments, and the facts and procedural history
underlying this case, do not advance the policy considerations
articulated in the concurrence in Matafeo.  Boyd's arguments are
conclusory and expressly speculative, as he asks this court to
make the inference that simply because the State purged 
investigation files related to shoplifting/theft, the documents
connected to that investigation are "presumptively prejudicial." 
Boyd does not explain how these documents are prejudicial in
relation to the specific facts of his case.  
Here, there is no reasonable possibility that the
administrative investigation files would have aided in Boyd's
defense in the OVUII trial beyond any benefit that might have
arisen from the fact of the subsequently-dismissed conviction
itself.  As explained above, the subpoenaed documents in
connection with Officer Yee's shoplifting prosecution do not
9NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
suggest that any related information was material to Boyd's guilt
or punishment.  As such, this is not a circumstance in which the
purged records were "so critical to the defense as to make
[Boyd's] criminal trial fundamentally unfair without it."  See
Matafeo, 71 Haw. at 186-87, 787 P.2d at 673 (holding that
evidence was not so crucial to the defense as to make defendant's
trial fundamentally unfair without it); State v. Steger , 114
Hawai#i 162, 169-71, 158 P.3d 280, 287-89 (App. 2006) (ruling
that lost photographs were not critical to the defense to make
defendant's trial fundamentally unfair without them, because the
photographs could not have provided a complete defense, did not
preclude defendant from pursuing his defense, and because
defendant's argument was too speculative).
Accordingly, the State's failure to disclose Officer
Yee's shoplifting prosecution, and failure to preserve the purged
records regarding the related administrative investigation files
do not amount to a Brady violation.  Absent a Brady violation and
any further explanation from Boyd connecting the information to
his own conviction, there is no reason upon which we can conclude
that the purged records would have led to the exclusion of
Officer Yee as a witness.  Boyd's second point is thus without
merit. 
Therefore, the January 3, 2018 Findings of Fact,
Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying Rule 40 Petition for Post
Conviction Relief entered by the District Court of the First
Circuit is affirmed.
