"Permits," states in pertinent part: 
Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the 
board of land and natural resources may issue permits 
for the temporary occupancy of state lands or an 
interest therein on a month- to-month basis by direct 
negotiation without public auction, under conditions 
and rent which will serve the best interests of the 
State, subject, however, to those restrictions as may 
from time to time be expressly imposed by the board. A 
permit on a month- to-month basis may continue for a 
period not to exceed one year from the date of its 
issuance; provided that the board may allow the permit 
to continue on a month- to-month basis for additional 
one year periods.

error (POEs),  the dispositive issues are whether the 
Environmental Court correctly concluded that (1) the 
cancellation of Syngenta Seeds' RP and issuance of Syngenta Hawaii's RP was an "action" triggering HEPA review, (2) the RP was not a "proposed" use subject to HEPA review, and (3) an 
exemption from HEPA review applied.   3 
We hold that summary judgment  on all claims in 
Appellants' Complaint was erroneously granted, where Syngenta 
Hawaii was a new applicant proposing an "action" subject to HEPA review involving the use of state lands under a new RP, and because there were genuine issues of material fact on whether Syngenta Hawaii's proposed activity was exempt from the 4
3 Appellants contend the Environmental Court erred by: (1) ruling 
that the RP was for "existing uses" and not "'proposed' uses" triggering HEPA 
review; (2) affirming BLNR's approval of an exemption from HEPA for its 
reissuance of Syngenta's RP; (3) "failing to address whether the [Department 
of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR)]'s recommended subdivision of land constituted an 'action' under HRS Chapter 343" triggering HEPA review; (4) 
"failing to address whether the 1982 conservation district use permit 
[(CDUP)]" was valid for the proposed uses permitted in 2017; and (5) "failing 
to address" whether BLNR's "failure to assess the environmental impacts" of 
Syngenta's land use "violated the public trust provisions" of the Hawai‘ i 
Constitution. 
 
On cross- appeal, Syngenta  contends  that the Environmental  Court 
erred by: (1) "finding that HEPA applies to decisions  under HRS §171- 55[,]" 
and (2) "expanding the definition of 'action' under HEPA to include a 
decision that did not initiate any program or project but merely maintained 
the status quo."   Syngenta's POE 1 lacks merit because the supreme court held 
in Carmichael  v. Bd. of Land &  Nat. Res., that " HRS §  171-55's 
'notwithstanding'  clause does not nullify HEPA's EA requirement[,]" and that 
HEPA may apply to decisions under HRS §  171-55. 150 Hawai‘ i 547, 567- 68, 506

I. BACKGROUND 
On June 13, 2017, Appellants filed a Complaint that 
set forth claims for declaratory and injunctive relief: Count 
1, Violation of HRS Chapter 343; Count 2, Exemption from HRS 
Chapter 343 was Invalid; Count 3, Failure to Enforce Conservation District Laws; Count 4, Violation of the Public Trust; and Count 5, Injunction. 
Syngenta's Motion for Summary Judgment On August 3, 2017, Syngenta filed a "Motion to Dismiss 
Complaint or, in the Alternative, for Summary Judgment" (Syngenta's MSJ), joined in part by BLNR.
6 Syngenta's MSJ 
argued, inter alia, that "HEPA is not implicated" because Syngenta Hawaii's RP "is not an 'action' or the type of 
'proposed use' subject to HEPA review[,]" as it maintains the 
"existing use" of the Property. Alternatively, Syngenta argued 
that even if HEPA was implicated, Syngenta Hawaii's RP was 
exempt from HEPA because the RP would maintain the existing use and "fits squarely within [an] exemption class . . . and its issuance w[ould] have no significant environmental effect, either individually or cumulatively." Syngenta's MSJ attached 
the following exhibits:

and December 2015 BLNR Staff Submittals for annual renewal of RPs on various 
islands. These documents were not presented below or considered by the 
Environmental Court, and they do not establish "adjudicative facts." See

submittal recommending the approval of the cancellation of 
Syngenta Seeds' RP and issuance of a new RP to Syngenta Hawaii 
(2017 RP Staff Submittal), which included an April 8, 1982 staff submittal recommending the approval of a Conservation District Use Application (1982 CDUA Staff Submittal) and a May 11, 1982 
letter by BLNR approving the 1982 CDUA (1982 CDUA Approval 
Letter); and (2) the February 24, 2017 BLNR meeting minutes reflecting approval of the 2017 RP Staff Submittal's recommendation (2017 RP Minutes). 
Appellants' October 31, 2017 Memorandum in Opposition 
to Syngenta's MSJ (Opposition) argued, inter alia, that the "BLNR's approval of the RP constituted an 'action' subject to [HEPA]"; "[p]roposals for uses are not required for [HEPA] environmental review"; and the RP was not exempt from HEPA because BLNR did not take a "hard look" at the environmental consequences of the RP, did not consider the "cumulative impacts" of the RP, and relied on "facial compliance of the 
described land use . . . ." 
Appellants' Motion for Summary Judgment 
On August 9, 2017, six days after Syngenta's MSJ was 
filed, Appellants also filed a Motion for Summary Judgment (Appellants' MSJ). Appellants' MSJ argued that "BLNR violated 
[HEPA] by failing to prepare an EA for Syngenta's proposed use of public trust lands"; BLNR's grant of a HEPA "exemption for its issuance of the new RP to Syngenta was invalid and in violation of [HEPA]" because it did not follow the proper exemption procedures, did not take a "hard look" at the environmental impacts of the RP, and relied on an "outdated CDUP"; and BLNR thus "violated its duties as a trustee of public 
facts presented for the first time on appeal" (cleaned up)); Weinberg v. 
Dickson- Weinberg, 123 Hawai‘ i 68, 79 n.8, 229 P.3d 1133, 1144 n.8 (2010)

trust resources." Appellants' MSJ attached the following 
pertinent exhibits: a 1981 CDUA for the 1982 CDUP;8 the 
transcript of a December 3, 1981 public hearing on the 1981 
CDUA; a January 8, 1982 published "Negative Declaration" (1982 Negative Declaration) regarding the 1981 CDUA; two separate RPs 
issued pursuant to the 1982 CDUP; a December 20, 1985 request to 
amend the 1982 CDUP to permit the subdivision of the Property to facilitate the sale of a lease to one of the permittees; and the transcript of a November 6, 1986 public hearing on the requested amendment. 
On November 1, 2017, Syngenta's Opposition and BLNR's 
Opposition were filed. Syngenta argued, inter alia, that "HEPA 
does not apply to BLNR's authorization of a month-to-month [RP]" because the RP "maintained the status quo" and the "exemption complied with HEPA." BLNR did not argue that the RP was not a 
HEPA "action" or a "proposed use," but argued that the RP was exempt from the preparation of an EA; the 1982 CDUP concerned 
the "proposed use of land," which was not at issue; the 1982 
CDUP was not "outdated"; and the RP simply granted "possession 
of [the] [P]roperty." BLNR's Opposition attached, inter alia, a 
November 7, 1986 DLNR Staff Submittal recommending the 1982 CDUP 
be amended, and a December 11, 1986 letter by BLNR approving the 
1986 CDUA. 
1982 Conservation District Use Permit 
The exhibits attached to the cross-MSJs reflect the 
following pertinent history. 
In 1981, Kekaha Sugar Company, 
Ltd. (Kekaha) submitted a CDUA to use 62 acres of state 
conservation land located in Kekaha, Kaua‘ i for "[f]arming 
operation[s] necessary to raise sugar cane."

constituting the 1982 CDUP.

On December 3, 1981, a public hearing was held on 
Kekaha's 1981 CDUA. At the hearing, Kekaha testified that 
Kekaha proposed to use the Property to "raise cane" and for 
"sugar cane cultivation . . . ." Kekaha additionally requested 
that Pride Company, Inc. (Pride) join Kekaha in the use of a 
portion of the Property for a "seed operation for research 
purposes" (seed research operation). BLNR's chairperson stated 
that the additional request regarding Pride would be "a major amendment" to the CDUA and questioned "whether it would be proper to modify" the CDUA to include more than one applicant. The case was left "open for another 15 days for written testimony," and the chairperson requested that Kekaha submit "something . . . in writing" "indicating that there [was] this possibility of a joint use" and that Pride submit "[s]omething indicating that they [were] interested in using part of" the Property.

The 1982 Negative Declaration was published in the 
January 8, 1982 Environmental Quality Commission Bulletin. As indicated below, the Bulletin explained what a Negative Declaration was, how the public could submit comments, and contained a deadline for challenging the Negative Declaration. The 1982 Negative Declaration for Kekaha's 1981 CDUA appeared as follows:

CONSERVATION DISTRICT USE APPLICATION FOR COMMERCIAL

, KEKAHA, KAUAI,  
Kekaha Sugar Company, Ltd./Dept. of Land and Natural 
Resources  
The applicant proposes to clear brush from the land and 
improve the sandy soil for the purpose of raising sugar 
cane. This would be done by incorporating mud press, settling basin mud and cane trash. The area, when planted 
with cane, will be irrigated by either an overhead or a 
drip irrigation system and will be incorporated into the 
adjacent cane field system. The entire parcel consists of 
132.5 acres, of which 62 acres are proposed for use. The parcel is located between a racing drag strip and cane and 
corn farming operations, TMK:4-1- 02:40.  
(Bolding and footnote added, underscoring and italics in 
original.)   The 1982 Negative Declaration did not include Pride 
or mention Pride's proposed use for a seed research operation, and only mentioned Kekaha's proposed "commercial agricultural use" of "raising sugar cane."  
The April 8, 1982 CDUA Staff Submittal recommended 
that BLNR approve the 1981 CDUA, and expressly noted Kekaha's request from the December 3, 1981 public hearing for Pride to be included as a co-applicant. The 1982 CDUA Staff Submittal 
stated that Pride proposed to use 43.6 acres of the Property for "growing of research seed stock fields, primarily corn, sunflowers, and soybeans"; and that Kekaha proposed to use 17.6

acres of the Property for "growing seed cane for use in more 
productive sugar cane growing areas." 
On May 11, 1982, BLNR sent the 1982 CDUA Approval 
Letter to Kekaha, noting that Pride was copied as a "co-applicant." The 1982 CDUA Approval Letter addressed to Kekaha 
stated that the CDUA for "commercial agriculture use" was approved and subject to conditions, including the requirement to "obtain appropriate authorization" from DLNR "for the occupancy of State lands[.]" 
1983 Revocable Permits In 1983, pursuant to HRS § 171-55, two RPs were issued 
to Kekaha and Pride. Pride received an RP to "[o]ccupy and use" 43.6 acres of the Property "for the following specified purposes only: AGRICULTURAL (corn seed cultivation)."   Pride later 
assigned its RP to a company that later became known as Syngenta Seeds.  
Kekaha  received an RP for 17.6 acres of the Property 
for "[a]gricultural purposes (cane seed cultivation)."   In 2001, 
Kekaha surrendered its RP.   Thereafter, the Agribusiness 
Development Corporation (ADC), which mistakenly thought it had control over the 17.6 acres of the Property (the portion of Kekaha's RP), entered into a license with Syngenta Seeds for the 17.6 acres of the Property "for agricultural purposes" from 2007 to 2017.    
Syngenta Hawaii's 2017 Revocable Permit On February 24, 2017, DLNR submitted its 2017 RP Staff 
Submittal, recommending that BLNR "[a]uthorize the cancellation of Revocable Permit No. S-5983 to Syngenta Seeds, LLC and the issuance of a new revocable permit to Syngenta Hawaii, LLC," covering the "entire 61.2 acres because [Syngenta Seeds] has 
been using the entire area since December 2007 and the CDUP 
allowed for cultivation of the larger area." The 2017 RP Staff

Hawaii as a "wholly-owned subsidiary" of Syngenta Seeds to 
"consolidate[e] its Hawaii operations and assets in a Hawaii 
limited liability company[,]" allowing Syngenta Hawaii and Syngenta Seeds "to facilitate various management, tax and other business objectives." The 2017 RP Staff Submittal noted that 
"[t]here will be no change in operations, use, or personnel following the cancellation and reissuance" of the RP, and that "[u]nder the [BLNR]'s current practice, revocable permits are 
not assignable by the permittee." 
The 2017 RP Staff Submittal's HRS Chapter 343 HEPA 
analysis stated as follows: 
CHAPTER 343 – ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT: 
In accordance with Hawaii Administrative Rule [(HAR)] 
Section 11- 200-8 and the Exemption List for the 
[DLNR] concurred with by the Environmental Council 
and dated June 5, 2015, the subject request is exempt 
from the preparation of an [EA] pursuant to Exemption 
Class No. 1. See Exemption Declaration [(Exemption Notification)] attached as Exhibit B. 
Additionally, [CDUA] No. KA-11/9/81- 1380 to Kekaha 
Sugar Company, Ltd. a nd Pride Company, Inc. was 
approved by [BLNR] at its meeting on April 8, 1982, 
Item H-4. 
(Emphases added.) The 2017 RP Staff Submittal's HEPA 
recommendation for an EA exemption stated: 
RECOMMENDATION: That the [BLNR]: 
1. Declare that, after considering the potential effects of 
the proposed disposition as provided by Chapter 343, 
HRS, and Chapter 11- 200, HAR, this project will probably 
have minimal or no significant effect on the environment and is therefore exempt from the preparation of an [EA]. 
The Exemption Notification attached to the 2017 RP

Exemption Class No.: In accordance with [HAR] Section 11-
200-8 and the Exemption List for 
[DLNR] concurred with by the 
Environmental Council and dated June 
5, 2015, the subject request is 
exempt from the preparation of an 
[EA] pursuant to Exemption Class No. 
1, Item 51, which states the "Permits, licenses, registrations, 
and rights- of-entry issued by the 
[DLNR] that are routine in nature, 
involving negligible impacts beyond 
that previously existing". [sic] 
The subject lands have been in 
agricultural use for many decades, 
which has resulted in no known 
significant impacts to the natural 
and environmental resources in the area. As such staff believes that 
the proposed issuance of a [RP] for 
the same use to a new entity would 
involve negligible or no expansion 
or change in use of the subject area beyond that previously existing. 
Recommendation: It is recommended that [BLNR] find that this disposition will probably 
have minimal or no significant 
effect on the environment and is 
presumed to be exempt from the 
preparation of an [EA]. 
(Emphases added.) 
The 2017 RP Minutes reflect BLNR approved the issuance 
of the new RP to Syngenta  Hawaii, but the new RP itself is not 
part of the record.  
Environmental Court's MSJ Ruling 
On November 9, 2017, a hearing was held on the 
parties' MSJs.
   The Environmental Court heard argument regarding 
the three conditions described in Umberger v. Dep't of Land & 
Nat. Res. that necessitate preparation of an EA.  As to 
Condition No. 1, the Environmental Court held that Syngenta 11
11 In Umberger, the Hawai‘ i Supreme Court held that: 
An [EA] under HEPA is required if three conditions are 
satisfied: (1) the proposed activity is an " action" under 
11           
 
  
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawaii's RP "is an action under the [Umberger] analysis."  As to 
Condition Nos. 2 and 3, the Environmental Court ruled as 
follows:  
THE COURT: . . . . So when you look at 343- 5(a)(1), 
all of  the actions, all of the nine actions, do start off  
with "proposed." So when they talk about proposed,  the 
Court believes they are talking about future action, action 
that is going to occur, not existing action.  
 In this situation, we had a permit that  involved  
existing action and there's been no evidence  that the 
action has changed before the issuance of  the permit or 
after the issuance of the permit, so  the second factor the 
[Appellants] cannot satisfy.  
 The third factor   -- when you look at   the exemption   
section, whether it's 11
-200-8 –  if  you look at the first 
one and even the exemption   cited by Syngenta, it refers to 
existing use, and so those are exempt activities, existing 
use. So  because of that, what the Court is doing is the 
Court  is granting the motion to dismiss, [Syngenta' s]  
motion  to dismiss, and denying [Appellants]' [MSJ].  
(Emphases added.) 
  On December 20, 2017, the Environmental Court filed 
its Order Granting Syngenta's MSJ, followed by the January 10, 2018 Final Judgment in favor of BLNR and Syngenta on all claims  
in Appellants' Complaint. These appeals followed.

III. DISCUSSION 
The Environmental Court's summary judgment ruling  
turned on its analysis of the three conditions triggering HEPA 
review set forth in Umberger, 140 Hawai‘ i at 512, 403 P.3d at 
289. We conclude that the Environmental Court erred in its 
analysis of 
Umberger  Condition Nos. 2 and 3 and in granting 
Syngenta's MSJ.  
A. Umberger Condition No. 1: Syngenta Hawaii's 
proposed activity under the new RP was an "action" under HRS § 343-2 subject to HEPA 
review. 
As to Condition No. 1, an EA is required if "the 
proposed activity is an 'action' under HRS § 343
-2 (2010)[.]" 
Umberger
, 140 Hawai‘i at 512, 403 P.3d at 289 (citation omitted). 
The Environmental Court concluded in its oral ruling that 
Syngenta's new RP was an "action" under Umberger. We initially note that the parties and the Environmental Court did not differentiate between BLNR's issuance of an HRS § 171-55 revocable permit, and the permittee's proposed activity under a  
permit. Here, BLNR's issuance of a revocable permit  was not an 
"action" for purposes of HEPA. It was the permittee's activity  
under the permit that potentially constitutes an "action." 
Carmichael, 150 
Hawai‘i at 569, 506 P.3d at 233 (explaining that 
the revocable permits themselves were not HEPA "actions," but 
rather it was the applicant's permitted activity that 
constituted HEPA "actions"); Umberger, 140 Hawai‘ i at 504, 514-
15, 403 P.3d at 281, 291-92. 
14           
 
   
 
 
 
  
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Syngenta argues that the issuance of the RP was not an 
"action" because it was not a "project" or "program," as it 
"merely maintained the status quo" or "existing conditions on a temporary basis with no new actions/plans contemplated or authorized."
13 Appellants argue that "[p]rograms or projects 
subject to [HEPA] may be ongoing" and that BLNR made "no specific finding" that Syngenta's RP would "maintain the status quo." 
"Action" is defined as "any program or project to be 
initiated by any agency or applicant." HRS § 343-2 (2010). In Umberger, the supreme court defined "project" as "a specific plan or design" or "a planned undertaking[,]" and a "program" as "a plan or system under which action may be taken toward a 
goal." 140 
Hawai‘i at 513, 403 P.3d at 290. In both Umberger  
and Carmichael, the supreme court held that the continuation of 
permitted activity may constitute an "action" for HEPA purposes.  
See Carmichael, 150 Hawai‘ i at 553, 569, 506 P.3d at 217, 233 
(holding that the continuation of water permits "during the past 
decade to divert more than 100 million gallons of water per day  
from east Maui streams required an [EA]" pursuant to HEPA); 
Umberger, 140 Hawai‘ i at 504, 514-15, 403 P.3d at 281, 291-92 
(holding that the continuation of one-year aquarium collection 
permits, which "authorize[d] the collection of fish or other 
aquatic life for aquarium purposes" "per year" was a "program" 
or "project" and a HEPA "action"). The Carmichael  court 
explained that while neither the "continuation decision nor the  
[RPs] themselves are HEPA 'actions,' . . . it is applicant's permitted activity -- i.e., the activity for which the 
[applicants] initially sought permit approval -- that 
13 BLNR "assumes, without conceding, that the cancellation and re-
issuance of [the RP] was an 'action' under HRS § 343-2 . . . ." 
15           
 
 
  
 
  Here, BLNR's cancellation of Syngenta Seeds' RP and 
issuance of the new RP to Syngenta Hawaii were not HEPA 
"actions." The commercial agricultural activity proposed by Syngenta Hawaii under the new RP, however, constituted an "action" within the meaning of HEPA. See id. The new RP 
permitted a new entity, Syngenta Hawaii, to occupy the Property to engage in a "project" or "program" of commercial agriculture  
in order to earn profit. See HRS § 343-2. Syngenta Hawaii's 
permitted activity is a "project" because it "facilitated a deliberate and coordinated effort" to use the property for 
commercial agricultural purposes. See Carmichael, 150 
Hawaiʻi at 
569, 506 P.3d at 233; Umberger, 140 Hawai‘ i at 514, 403 P.3d at 
291. The permitted activity is also a "program" because it 
involves a "'plan or system'" to use the Property for commercial agricultural purposes with a "'goal'" to earn profit. See 
Carmichael, 150 Hawai‘ i at 569, 506 P.3d at 233 (citation 
omitted); Umberger, 140 Hawai‘ i at 514, 403 P.3d at 291. The 
Environmental Court correctly concluded that Syngenta  Hawaii's  
proposed activity under the new  RP was an "action"  subject to 
HEPA review, and that Condition No. 1 was met. See id. at 560, 
506 P.3d at 224; Kilakila ʻ O Haleakala, 138 Hawaiʻ i at 375, 382 
P.3d at 187.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
constitutes 'action' within the meaning of HEPA." Id. at 569, 
506 P.3d at 233 (citation omitted). The Carmichael permittees' 
activity constituted a "project" because "the permits facilitated a deliberate and coordinated effort by the . . . Defendants to use their water system to deliver water and manage 
water use for the permitted areas." Id. (citation omitted). 
The permitted activity was also a "program" because it involved 
a "'plan or system'" with the purpose of "meet[ing] . . . Defendants' (and their customers') water needs." Id. (citation 
omitted).

B. Umberger Condition No. 2: Syngenta Hawaii 
was a new applicant proposing an "action" under a new RP for the use of state lands 
under HRS § 343-5(a)(1). 
As to Condition No. 2, an EA is required if "the 
action proposes one or more of the nine categories of land uses  
or administrative acts enumerated in HRS § 343-5(a) (2010)."   
Umberger, 140 Hawai‘ i at 512, 403 P.3d at 289 (citation omitted). 
HRS § 343-5(a)(1) provides that an EA is required for actions 
that "[p]ropose the use of state . . . lands . . . ." While Syngenta Hawaii's proposed activity under the new RP involved the use of state lands, the Environmental Court concluded that HRS § 343-5(a)(1) applies to actions that are "proposed," which the court construed to mean "future action" and excluding "existing action[,]" and thus, the second condition triggering HEPA review was not met on this basis.  14 
Relying on 
Umberger and Carmichael, Appellants argue 
that the Environmental Court erroneously ruled that BLNR's issuance of the RP to Syngenta Hawaii was for "existing uses" and not "'proposed' uses" subject to HEPA review.  BLNR 
"assumes, without conceding, that the cancellation and re-issuance of [the RP] . . . met one of the 'triggers' under HRS § 343-5(a)." Syngenta argues, inter alia, that unlike the RP in 
Carmichael, its RP did not grant Syngenta Hawaii the "permission 
14   HRS § 343- 5(a)  (2010), entitled "Applicability and requirements," 
mandates an EA for various categories of land use set forth in subsections 
(1) through (9), of which subsection (1) pertaining to use of state land, is 
relevant here. This subsection states:  
(a)
 Except as otherwise provided, an [EA] shall be required 
for actions that: 
(1) Propose the use of state or county lands . . .; 
provided that the agency shall consider environmental factors and available alternatives in its feasibility 
or planning studies; . . . . 
(Emphases added.) 
17           
 
   
  Here, the record reflects that Syngenta Hawaii was a 
new applicant for a new 
RP. Syngenta Seeds and  Syngenta Hawaii 
are separate legal entities. The 2017 Exemption Notification 
noted the RP would be issued "to a new entity . . . ."  BLNR 
adopted the 2017 RP Staff Submittal's recommendation to cancel 
Syngenta Seeds' RP and to issue "a new [RP] to Syngenta Hawaii  
. . . ."   Thus, Syngenta Hawaii was  a new applicant proposing an 
"action" under a new RP for the use of state lands under HRS § 343-5(a)(1), and the Environmental Court erred by concluding 
that Condition No. 2 was not met. See Carmichael, 150 
Hawai‘i at 
569, 506  P.3d at 233; Kilakila ‘ O Haleakala, 138 Hawai‘ i at 375, 
382 P.3d at 187.

to use any resources," but rather sought a "corporate name 
change to an existing [RP]." 
C. Umberger Condition No. 3: There were 
genuine issues of material fact about whether Syngenta Hawaii's proposed activity 
was exempt from HEPA review. 
As to Condition No. 3, an EA is required if "the 
action is not declared exempt pursuant to HRS § 343-6(a)(2)  
(2010)."   Umberger, 140 Hawai‘ i at 512, 403 P.3d at 289 
(citation omitted). Pursuant to HRS § 343-6(a)(2), HAR § 11-15
15 HRS § 343-6(a)(2) (2010), entitled "Rules," provides for agencies 
to adopt rules and establish procedures to exempt actions from environmental 
review. This subsection states:  
(a) After consultation with the affected agencies, the council shall adopt, amend, or repeal necessary 
rules for the purposes of this chapter in accordance 
with chapter 91 including, but not limited to, rules 
that shall: 
(2) Establish procedures whereby specific types of 
actions, because they will probably have minimal or no significant effects on the environment, are declared exempt from the preparation of an [EA][.] 
(Emphasis added.)

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
200-8(a) (repealed 2019), established "Exempt Classes of Action" 
as follows: 
(a) Chapter 343, HRS, states that a list of classes of 
actions shall be drawn up which, because they will probably 
have minimal or no significant effect on the environment, 
may be declared exempt by the proposing agency or approving 
agency from the preparation of an [EA] provided that 
agencies declaring an action exempt under this section shall obtain the advice of other outside agencies or 
individuals having jurisdiction or expertise as to the 
propriety of the exemption. Actions declared exempt from 
the preparation of an [EA] under this section are not 
exempt from complying with any other applicable statute or 
rule. . . . 
(Emphasis added.) DLNR's exemption list under HAR § 11-200-8(a) 
included Exemption Class No. 1, Item 51, which exempted: 
"Permits, licenses, registrations, and rights-of-entry issued by the [DLNR] that are routine in nature, involving negligible 
impacts beyond that previously existing." (Emphasis added.) The Environmental Court concluded that because the exemption at issue here "refers to existing use," it applied to Syngenta Hawaii. 
Appellants argue, inter alia, that BLNR improperly 
relied on the 1982 CDUP for HEPA compliance because "Syngenta's proposed uses of the [Property] were not covered under its terms[,]" and that the 1982 CDUP was "issued to a different applicant and for different uses . . . ." Appellants argue that 
the 1982 Negative Declaration was for Kekaha's "soil improvements, clearing brush, [and] 'raising sugar cane,'" and that the "CDUP processes did not entail examination of Syngenta's agribusiness practices, which include restricted use 
pesticide use and GMO cultivation." Appellants argue that 
because of the "[l]acking . . . environmental disclosure 
documents, [BLNR] was not informed of the amount and types of pesticides that would be used" in conjunction with the seed research operation. 
19           
 
  
  
   
 
  
  
 
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
BLNR argues, inter alia, that Syngenta's RP would 
"change the name on the permit and amend the acreage of land it 
covered, while not changing anything that Syngenta was already permitted to do on the [Property]." BLNR argues that the 1982 
CDUP authorized the use of the Property for "commercial 
agricultural use"; Syngenta's RP would "only authorize the 
occupancy of the [state] land on a temporary basis"; and the RP does "not authorize any specific type of land use . . . ." Additionally, BLNR "noted that there were no known environmental consequences from the past agricultural use of the [Property] by 
Syngenta . . . ." Syngenta argues, inter alia, that the new RP 
"did not change Syngenta's existing seed farm operations, facilities and personnel in any manner." 
In determining whether an "action" is exempt from 
HEPA, "the agency must conduct a four-step analysis:" 
an action is exempt from HEPA if (1) it is within an exempt 
class  promulgated by the Environmental Council in HAR § 11-
200-8(a)  or within an exemption category created by the 
agency itself pursuant to its authority under HAR § 11- 200-
8(d); (2) the relevant exemption category can be applied because the activity does not have a significant cumulative impact and it does not have a significant impact on a 
particularly sensitive environment, see  HAR § 11- 200-8(b); 
(3) the agency obtained the advice of other agencies or individuals having jurisdiction or expertise as to the 
propriety of the exemption, HAR § 11- 200-8(a); and (4) the 
action will probably have minimal or no significant effects 
on the environment, HRS §  343-6(a)(2); see  also  HAR § 11-
200-8(d); Sierra Club, 115 Hawai‘ i at 315- 16, 167 P.3d at 
308-09.  
Umberger, 140 Hawai‘ i at 524, 403 P.3d at 301 (emphasis added). 
"If the action fails to satisfy any of the four requirements 
discussed, it is not exempt from HEPA." Id. (citation omitted). 
Here, the Environmental Court's analysis was 
incomplete because it stopped at step (1) of the above analysis  
(i.e. the exemption class determination), and it did not 
consider steps (2), (3), and (4). See id. We conclude that 
20           
 
 
  
   
 
  
  
   
 
  
  
  
  
   
 
 
  
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
there was a material factual dispute as to step (1), whether the 
exemption was properly applied as a matter of law, given HAR § 11-200-8(a)'s requirement that the action be one that "will probably have minimal or no significant effect on the environment" for inclusion in the exemption class. 
The 2017 Exemption Notification explained that the 
Property had "been in agricultural use for many decades, which has resulted in no known significant impacts to the natural and environmental resources in the area." To support this finding, 
the 2017 RP Staff Submittal relied on the 1982 CDUP, and attached the 1982 CDUA Staff Submittal and 1982 CDUA Approval Letter. The record reflects, however, that the 1981 CDUA was 
initiated by Kekaha for raising sugar cane; Pride was later added as a co-applicant for its seed research operation; the FONSI in the 1982 Negative Declaration only applied to Kekaha and not Pride; and the FONSI determined that Kekaha's proposed activity of "raising sugar cane" would "not have significant 
effects on the environment" and did "not require [an] EIS 
. . . ." The record of the 1982 CDUP presented here does not 
reflect that the environmental impact of Pride's proposed seed research operation activity was considered or reviewed with Kekaha's 1981 CDUA. 
In addition, the record is insufficient to support the 
2017 Exemption Notification's determination that there was "no expansion or change in use of the subject area beyond that previously existing." The record does not contain a detailed 
description of Syngenta Hawaii's activity under the new RP vis-
à-vis the previously existing permitted activity to support the conclusion of "no expansion or change in use . . . ." Nor does 
the record establish whether Syngenta Seeds' permitted activity 
was similar to the "raising sugar cane" activity included in the 
1982 FONSI, or similar to the seed research operation activity 
21           
 
  
 
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that was not included in the 1982 FONSI. Appellants presented 
evidence of what they claimed were environmental impacts from Syngenta's seed research operation, which included, inter alia, harm to marine life, insects and native plants, soil, and an increase in certain types of illnesses from Syngenta's use of 
pesticides. That evidence created genuine issues of material 
fact which should have precluded summary judgment. 
On this record, we conclude there are genuine issues 
of material fact as to whether BLNR could properly rely on the 
1982 CDUP in determining that there were "no known significant impacts"  on the environment  from Syngenta Hawaii's proposed 
activity, and whether Syngenta Hawaii's proposed activity under the new RP "will probably have minimal or no significant effect on the environment" for an HAR § 11-200-8(a) exemption. Thus, as to Condition No. 3, the Environmental Court erred in concluding as a matter of law that Syngenta Hawaii's proposed activity was exempt from HEPA review because it qualified for 
inclusion in "Exemption Class No. 1, Item 51[.]" See HRCP Rule
