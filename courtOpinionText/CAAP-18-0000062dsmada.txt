JO, Plaintiff-Appellee v.
GO, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CASE NO. FC-DV 16-1-007294 (NO. 1DV161007294))
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
Upon review of the record in this appeal, No. CAAP-18-
0000062, and in the Hawai #i State Judiciary's Ho# ohiki database
for the underlying family court case, No. FC-DV 16-1-007294 (No.
1DV161007294), it appears that: 
(1) On February 9, 2018, the court denied pro se
Defendant-Appellant GO's (GO) February 5, 2018 motion for leave
to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis without prejudice to him
seeking relief in the underlying case.  The court specified the
procedures for GO to follow, including, without limitation,
either filing in the underlying case a motion for leave to
proceed on appeal in forma pauperis , or paying the filing fees in
the full amount to the Supreme Court Clerk's Office, within
fifteen days from the date of the order.  The court cautioned GO
that failure to file the motion for leave to proceed on appeal inNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
forma pauperis  in the underlying case or pay the filing fees may
result in the appeal being dismissed, pursuant to Hawai #i Rules
of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 24(c);
(2) On May 4, 2018, the court denied GO's March 12,
2018 motion for leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis
again without prejudice to him seeking relief in the underlying
case.  The court noted GO failed to demonstrate that he filed a
motion for leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis  in the
underlying case, or that any of the exceptions in HRAP Rule 24(a)
applied.  The court again specified the procedures for GO to
follow, including, without limitation, either filing in the
underlying case a motion for leave to proceed on appeal in forma
pauperis , or paying the filing fees in the full amount to the
Supreme Court Clerk's Office, within ten days from the date of
the order.  The court again cautioned GO that failure to file the
motion for leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis in the
underlying case or pay the filing fees may result in the appeal
being dismissed, pursuant to HRAP Rule 24(c);
(3) The Ho #ohiki database for the underlying case
indicates GO has not filed in that case a motion for leave to
proceed on appeal in forma pauperis , and GO has not otherwise
paid the appellate filing fees;
(4) On August 22, 2018, the appellate clerk entered a
default of the record on appeal, informing GO that the time to
docket the appeal expired on April 6, 2018, he had not paid the
filing fee or obtained an order allowing him to proceed on appeal
in forma pauperis, the matter would be brought to the court's
attention on September 4, 2018, for action that may include
dismissal of the appeal, and he could seek relief from default by
motion;

(5) GO took no further action in this appeal; and
(6) An appeal may be dismissed where the record on
appeal has not been prepared because the appellant failed to pay 
the required fees or obtain an order allowing the appellant to
proceed in forma pauperis .  HRAP Rule 11(b)(2), (c)(2).
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is
dismissed.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, January 14, 2019.
