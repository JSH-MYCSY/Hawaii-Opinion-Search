MEMORANDUM OPINION 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
These consolidated appeals arise from a single mortgage
foreclosure case. 
In CAAP-18-071, Defendants-Appellants Terrence
Ryan (Terrence)  and Lucille Ryan (Lucille) (collectively, the
Ryans) seek to appeal from the judgment and three post-judgment 
orders entered by the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit: 21 
 
1. September 20, 2017 order granting summary judgment
in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee Wilmington Savings
Fund Society, FSB (Wilmington
) (Foreclosure 
Order); 
2. September 20, 2017 judgment in favor of Wilmington
(Foreclosure Judgment); 
3. December 8, 2017 order denying their motion toreconsider the Foreclosure Order and the Fore-
closure Judgment and to set aside their defaults(Order Denying Reconsideration of Foreclosure); 
4. January 31, 2018 order denying their ex parte
motion for extension of time to file a notice of 
appeal from the Order Denying Reconsideration ofForeclosure (Order Denying Ex Parte Extension 
Motion); and

to them by their given names when necessary to avoid confusion. 
2 The Honorable Kathleen N.A. Watanabe presided. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
5. February 6, 2018 order denying their ex parte
motion to advance the hearing on their February 2,
2018 hearing motion for extension of time to filenotice of appeal (Order Denying Hearing 
Advancement). 
We lack jurisdiction to review the Foreclosure Order, Foreclosure 
Judgment, Order Denying Reconsideration of Foreclosure, and Order Denying Hearing Advancement. We affirm the January 31, 2018 Order Denying Ex Parte Extension Motion for the reasons explained below. 
In CAAP-18-312, the Ryans appeal from the: 
6. March 8, 2018 order denying their February 2, 2018
motion for reconsideration of Ex Parte Appeal
Extension Denial (Order Denying Reconsideration of
Ex Parte Appeal Extension Denial). 
For the reasons explained below, we affirm. 
And in CAAP-18-388, the Ryans appeal from the: 
7. April 5, 2018 order denying their hearing motion
for extension of time to file notice of appeal
(Appeal Extension Denial). 
For the reasons explained below, we affirm. 
Procedural History 
This case has a long, complicated history. A fore-
closure complaint was filed on October 30, 2012, by Bank of 
America, N.A. It alleged, among other things, that the Ryans had defaulted on a promissory note payable to Bank of America and secured by a mortgage on real property located in Kalâ heo on the 
island of Kaua# i. On September 18, 2014, Green Tree Servicing, 
LLC substituted as the plaintiff. On July 20, 2016, Ditech Financial LLC substituted as the plaintiff. On December 22, 2016, Wilmington substituted as the plaintiff. 
Between November 7, 2012, and April 1, 2013, Bank of 
America unsuccessfully attempted to personally serve the fore
-
closure complaint upon the Ryans in Kalâheo, Kaua# i, Eastham, 
Massachusetts, Rainier, Washington, and Yelm, Washington. On February 20, 2015, the circuit court entered an order authorizing 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
service upon the Ryans by certified mail. Terrence was served 
with the complaint on March 13, 2015, at an address in Yelm, Washington. Lucille was served with the complaint on March 19, 2015, at an address in Rainier, Washington. Accordingly, Terrence's answer to the complaint was due on April 2, 2015,
3 and 
Lucille's answer was due on April 8, 2015. 
On March 23, 2015, a self-represented Terrence filed a 
motion requesting a 120-day extension of time to respond to the complaint.
4 Terrence's motion stated: 
Defendants currently reside in the State of Washington are
[sic] seeking assistance concerning this matter, but due totime, distance and resource limitations, Defendants have notbeen given the opportunity to adequately locate and retainlocal State of Hawaii counsel and consult with such counsel,and for this reason requests [sic] an additional 120 days torespond. 
The motion did not include a notice of hearing, as required by 
Rule 7 of the Rules of the Circuit Courts of the State of Hawai# i 
(RCCH). The motion did not comply with RCCH Rule 7.2 ("Civil 
motions practice"), which prescribes procedures for obtaining a 
hearing date and submitting copies of the motion to the assigned judge. 
The circuit court did not rule on the motion before 
Terrence's and Lucille's answers became due. The Ryans never answered the foreclosure complaint. 
On April 27, 2017, more than two years after the Ryans' 
answers were due, Wilmington requested and the circuit court clerk entered the Ryans' defaults.
5 The entry of default was 
served by mail upon the Ryans at the same addresses where they 
3 Rule 12(a)(1) of the Hawai #i Rules of Civil Procedure ( HRCP )
provides, in relevant part: "A defendant shall serve an answer within 20 days
after being served with the summons and complaint[.]" 
4 The motion also sought an extension of time for Lucille, but
Lucille did not sign the motion. Terrence, who is not licensed to practicelaw in Hawai #i, could not have signed the motion on Lucille's behalf. See 
Oahu Plumbing & Sheet Metal, Ltd. v. Kona Constr., Inc., 60 Haw. 372, 377, 590P.2d 570, 573 (1979). 
5 HRCP Rule 55 provides, in relevant part: 
(a) Entry. When a party against whom a judgment for
affirmative relief is sought has failed to plead orotherwise defend as provided by these rules and that fact ismade to appear by affidavit or otherwise, the clerk shallenter the party's default. 
4  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
were served with the foreclosure complaint. As of this point, 
the circuit court had not entered an order on Terrence's motion for extension of time. 
Wilmington moved for summary judgment and a decree of 
foreclosure on June 21, 2017. The hearing was set for September 5, 2017. 
On August 31, 2017, the Ryans — through counsel — filed 
an untimely memorandum in opposition to Wilmington's motion for summary judgment.
6 They did not submit affidavits or 
declarations. They did not controvert that they signed the promissory note and mortgage, or that they failed to make the payments due under the promissory note. They did not contest the amount of their debt. Their sole argument was that Wilmington's motion failed to establish that Bank of America (the original holder of the Ryans' promissory note) was the holder when it filed the complaint, citing Bank of Am., N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai# i 361, 390 P.3d 1248 (2017) (holding that assignee of 
note and mortgage must establish entitlement to enforce note at the time action was commenced). The Ryans did not ask to have their defaults set aside, nor did they move to set aside their defaults at that time. 
Wilmington's motion for summary judgment was heard on 
September 5, 2017. The Ryans appeared through counsel. After hearing arguments, the circuit court noted that the Ryans had never moved to set aside their defaults, and orally granted Wilmington's motion. The Foreclosure Order and the Foreclosure 
Judgment were entered on September 20, 2017. Notice of entry of 
the Foreclosure Judgment was mailed to the Ryans' counsel on 
September 20, 2017. 
On September 29, 2017, the Ryans moved for reconsid-
eration of the Foreclosure Order and the Foreclosure Judgment (which was a judgment by default under HRCP Rule 55(b)(2) because 
6 RCCH Rule 7(b) provides, in relevant part: 
An opposing party may serve and file . . . a memorandum in
opposition to the motion, which shall be served and filednot less than 8 days before the date set for the hearing[.] 
(Underscoring added.) 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 entry of the Ryans' defaults had never been set aside). The 
motion for reconsideration also requested that the Ryans' defaults be set aside. The motion was not supported by an affidavit or declaration from either of the Ryans. The circuit court denied the motion; the Order Denying Reconsideration of
Foreclosure was entered on December 8, 2017. 
At some time before January 31, 2018, the Ryans sub-
mitted an ex parte motion for an extension of time to file a 
notice of appeal from the Order Denying Reconsideration of Foreclosure. The ex parte motion was dated January 26, 2018. The ex parte motion was stamped "DENIED" by the circuit court and the Order Denying Ex Parte Extension Motion was entered on 
January 31, 2018. 
On February 2, 2018, the Ryans filed a motion for 
reconsideration of the Order Denying Ex Parte Extension Motion. 
The circuit court denied the motion. The Order Denying
Reconsideration of Ex Parte Appeal Extension Denial was entered 
on March 8, 2018. 
Also on February 2, 2018, the Ryans filed a motion for 
extension of time to file a notice of appeal as a hearing motion, 
along with an ex parte motion to advance the hearing date for the motion for extension. The ex parte motion to advance hearing date was stamped "DENIED" and the Order Denying Hearing
Advancement was entered on February 6, 2018. The hearing on the 
motion for extension of time to file notice of appeal was set for 
March 6, 2018. During the hearing, the circuit court orally denied the motion. The Appeal Extension Denial was entered on 
April 5, 2018. 
Meanwhile, on February 6, 2018, the Ryans filed a 
notice of appeal from the Foreclosure Order, Foreclosure Judg-
ment, Order Denying Reconsideration of Foreclosure, Order DenyingEx Parte Extension Motion, and Order Denying Hearing Advancement. 
This resulted in CAAP-18-071. 
On April 6, 2018, the Ryans filed a notice of appeal 
from the March 8, 2018 Order Denying Reconsideration of Ex ParteAppeal Extension Denial. This resulted in CAAP-18-312. 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On May 4, 2018, the Ryans filed a notice of appeal from 
the April 5, 2018 Appeal Extension Denial. This resulted in 
CAAP-18-388. 
We consolidated these appeals on August 13, 2018. 
CAAP-18-071 
The Foreclosure Order and Foreclosure Judgment were 
immediately appealable. Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 667-
51(a)(1) (2016); see Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai# i at 371-72, 390 P.3d 
at 1258-59. When the Foreclosure Order and Foreclosure Judgment 
were filed, Rule 4 of the 
Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
(eff. July 1, 2016) (HRAP) provided, in relevant part: 
APPEALS - WHEN TAKEN. 
(a) Appeals in civil cases. 
(1) TIME AND PLACE OF FILING . When a civil appeal is
permitted by law, the notice of appeal shall be filed within
30 days after entry of the judgment or appealable order. 
. . . . 
(3) TIME TO APPEAL AFFECTED BY POST-JUDGMENT MOTIONS . If any
party files a timely motion . . . to reconsider, alter oramend the judgment or order, or for attorney's fees orcosts, and court . . . rules specify the time by which themotion shall be filed, then the time for filing the noticeof appeal is extended for all parties until 30 days afterentry of an order disposing of the motion. 
Thus, a notice of appeal from the Foreclosure Order and Fore-
closure Judgment was due 30 days after September 20, 2017, unless a timely motion for reconsideration was filed. 
The Ryans moved for reconsideration of the Foreclosure 
Judgment on September 29, 2017, citing HRCP Rules 59(e) and 60(b). HRCP Rule 59 provides, in relevant part: 
NEW TRIALS; AMENDMENT OF JUDGMENTS. 
. . . . 
(e)
 Motion to alter or amend judgment . Any motion to
alter or amend a judgment shall be filed no later than 10
days after entry of the judgment. 
(Underscoring added.) Because the Ryans' motion for reconsider-
ation was filed within 10 days after entry of the Foreclosure Judgment, the deadline for the Ryans to appeal from the Fore-
7  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
closure Judgment was extended until 30 days after entry of an 
order disposing of the motion. The Order Denying Reconsideration
of Foreclosure was entered on December 8, 2017, making a notice 
of appeal from the Foreclosure Order, Foreclosure Judgment, and 
Order Denying Reconsideration of Foreclosure due on January 8, 2018.
7 The Ryans' first notice of appeal (creating CAAP-18-071) 
was not filed until February 6, 2018. The failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise of judicial discretion. Bacon 
v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986). We lack jurisdiction to review the Foreclosure Order, Foreclosure 
Judgment, and Order Denying Reconsideration of Foreclosure. 
In addition, although the February 6, 2018 notice of 
appeal was filed within 30 days after entry of the February 6, 
2018 Order Denying Hearing Advancement, a trial court's ruling on 
a motion to shorten time for, advance, or reschedule a hearing is 
not subject to review or reconsideration. See RCCH 
Rule 7.2(g)(5)(A). 
The January 31, 2018 Order Denying Ex Parte Extension 
Motion was immediately appealable. See Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 
Hawai# i 153, 157, 80 P.3d 974, 978 (2003) (holding that "[a] post-
judgment order is an appealable final order under HRS § 641-1(a) if the order ends the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be accomplished.") The February 6, 2018 notice of appeal was filed within 30 days after entry of that post-judgment order. 
We have 
jurisdiction over the Ryans' appeal from the Order Denying Ex 
Parte Extension Motion
. 
On about January 26, 2018, the Ryans submitted their ex 
parte motion for extension of time to file a notice of appeal 
from the December 8, 2017 Order Denying Reconsideration of
Foreclosure under RCCH Rule 7.2(f) (eff. July 1, 2014). The rule 
provides: 
7 The 30th day after December 8, 2017, was Sunday, January 7, 2018.
Accordingly, the deadline to file a notice of appeal was Monday, January 8,
2018. See HRAP Rule 26(a). 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Ex parte motions . A motion entitled to be heard ex parte
shall: 
(1) cite the statute, rule, or other authority authorizing the
court to entertain the motion ex parte; 
(2) be supported by an affidavit or declaration stating the
reason(s) for filing the motion ex parte, the efforts made to notify
parties, and, if the motion is to shorten time or advance a hearingpursuant to subsection (g)(5) of this Rule, the efforts made to obtain astipulation or response from the other parties in the case or thereason(s) why no attempt was made; 
(3) be accompanied by a proposed order; and 
(4) be served on the date that the motion was presented to
the court. 
The Ryans' request for an extension of time to file their notice 
of appeal was made pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(4), which provides: 
(A) Requests for extensions of time before expiration of the
prescribed time. The court or agency appealed from, upon a showing of
good cause, may extend the time for filing a notice of appeal uponmotion filed within the time prescribed by subsections (a)(1) through(a)(3) of this Rule. However, no such extension shall exceed 30 dayspast such prescribed time. An extension motion that is filed before the 
expiration of the prescribed time may be ex parte  unless the court or 
agency otherwise requires. 
(B) Requests for extensions of time after expiration of the
prescribed time. The court or agency appealed from, upon a showing ofexcusable neglect, may extend the time for filing the notice of appealupon motion filed not later than 30 days after the expiration of thetime prescribed by subsections (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this Rule.However, no such extension shall exceed 30 days past the prescribedtime. Notice of an extension motion filed after the expiration of the
prescribed time shall be given to the other parties in accordance withthe rules of the court or agency appealed from . 
(Emphasis added.) HRAP Rule 4(a)(4) allows an ex parte motion 
for extension of time to file a notice of appeal only if the motion is filed before expiration of the original deadline to appeal. The Ryans' motion, being submitted on January 26, 2018 (after expiration of the January 8, 2018 appeal deadline), shouldnot have been filed ex parte. The circuit court properly stamped"DENIED" on the ex parte motion and filed it on January 31, 2018.We affirm the circuit court's January 31, 2018 Order Denying Ex 
Parte Extension Motion.  
  
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
CAAP-18-312 
The Ryans' April 6, 2018 notice of appeal (which 
created CAAP-18-312) was filed within 30 days after entry of the 
March 8, 2018 Order Denying Reconsideration of Ex Parte Appeal
Extension Denial. We have jurisdiction to review that order. 
"An order granting or denying a motion for reconsideration is 
reviewed for abuse of discretion; an abuse of discretion occurs where the circuit court has clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or has disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant." Tax Appeal of Subway 
Real Estate Corp. v. Dir. of Taxation, State of Haw., 110 Hawai# i 
25, 30, 129 P.3d 528, 533 (2006) (cleaned up and reformatted). 
As explained above, the Ryans' motion for extension of 
time to file notice of appeal was improperly filed as an ex parte motion because the time to appeal had already expired. HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B) required that "[n]otice . . . be given to the other parties in accordance with the rules of the court . . . appealed from." The circuit court did not abuse its discretion by denying reconsideration. The March 8, 2018 Order Denying
Reconsideration of Ex Parte Appeal Extension Denial is affirmed. 
CAAP-18-388 
The Ryans' May 4, 2018 notice of appeal (which created
CAAP-18-388) was filed within 30 days after entry of the Appeal
Extension Denial on April 5, 2018. We have jurisdiction to 
review that order. We review under the abuse of discretion 
standard. Enos v. Pac. Transfer & Warehouse, Inc., 80 Hawai# i 
345, 349, 910 P.2d 116, 120 (1996). 
The Ryans failed to establish "excusable neglect" as 
required by HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B). The order from which they intended to appeal was the Order Denying Reconsideration of
Foreclosure, entered on December 8, 2017. They contend that 
their attorney's legal assistant contacted the circuit court on 
January 2, 2018, to "check on the status" of the order after not seeing the order entered in the Judiciary's Ho# ohiki website. 
They argue that the legal assistant "was told by the [judge]'s staff that the order was not yet entered and it might be on [the 
10 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
judge]'s desk, that [the judge] was out at the time, and that 
they will follow up on the following Monday," and it was not until they re-checked Ho# ohiki on January 25, 2018, that they 
realized the order had been entered on December 8, 2017. Thus, they contend that the circuit court clerk is to blame for their failure to file a timely notice of appeal. 
A similar argument was made, and dismissed by the
Hawai# i
 Supreme Court, in Enos:  
Pacific Transfer argued, and the trial court
implicitly agreed, that the clerk's failure to promptly file
a notice of entry of judgment excuses the failure to timelyfile a notice of appeal. This is in direct contravention ofthe plain language of HRCP Rule 77(d), which provides inrelevant part that:  
Lack of notice of the entry by the clerk, or failureto make such service, does not affect the time toappeal or relieve or authorize the court to relieve aparty for failure to appeal within the time allowed,except as permitted in Rule 4(a) of the Hawai #i Rules 
of Appellate Procedure. 
Although HRCP Rule 77(d) specifically refers to HRAP
Rule 4(a) as providing the only relief for a party's failure
to timely file a notice of appeal, nothing in Rule 77(d)suggests that the failure of the clerk to timely notify theparties of the entry of judgment could excuse a party'sneglect. A party has an independent duty to keep informedand mere failure of the clerk to notify the parties thatjudgment has been entered does not provide grounds forexcusable neglect or warrant an extension of time. This is especially so where, as here, appellants presented no reasonfor their failure, for example, to send a messenger to courtto look up the relevant date, and we see no forces beyondtheir control—at least on this record—that prevented themfrom taking this eminently reasonable step. 
Enos, 80 Hawai# i at 353, 910 P.2d at 124 (cleaned up). In this 
case, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion by denying
the Ryans' motion to extend time to file notice of appeal. Thecircuit court's April 5, 2018 Appeal Extension Denial  is 
affirmed.
