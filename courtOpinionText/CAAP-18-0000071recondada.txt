APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 5CC121000306)
ORDER
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Hiraoka and McCullen, JJ.)
Upon consideration of the Motion for Reconsideration
filed by Defendants-Appellants Terrence Ryan and Lucille Ryan on
April 21, 2022, the papers in support, and the record, it appears
that the court did not overlook or misapprehend any point of law
or fact when it entered the April 11, 2022 Summary Disposition
Order.  A motion to extend a deadline does not toll the deadline.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion for
Reconsideration is denied.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, April 27, 2022.
