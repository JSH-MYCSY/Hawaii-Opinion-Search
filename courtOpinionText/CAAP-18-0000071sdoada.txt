APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 5CC121000306) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Hiraoka and McCullen, JJ.) 
These consolidated appeals arise from a mortgage 
foreclosure action. 
Defendants-Appellants Terrence Ryan and
Lucille  Ryan (collectively, the Ryans)  appealed from a judgment 
entered by the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit on 
September 20, 2017.  In a memorandum opinion filed April 9, 
2020, we held we lacked jurisdiction to review three of the Ryans' points of error. The Ryans petitioned for certiorari. The supreme court held there was appellate jurisdiction and 21
remanded for consideration on the merits. Wilmington Sav. Fund 
Soc'y, FSB v. Ryan, 148 Hawai# i 515, 518 n.3, 479 P.3d 133, 136 
n.3 (2021). 
The Ryans appeal from: 
(1) the September 20, 2017 order granting summary
judgment in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee
Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB
(
Foreclosure Decree); 
(2) the September 20, 2017 Judgment in favor of Wilmington; and 
1 Because the Ryans share a surname, we refer to them by their given
names when necessary to avoid confusion. 
2 The Honorable Kathleen N.A. Watanabe presided.

(3) the December 8, 2017 order denying the Ryans'
motion to reconsider the Foreclosure Decree 
and the Judgment and to set aside theirdefaults (Order Denying Reconsideration). 
For the reasons explained below, we affirm the Foreclosure 
Decree, the Judgment, and the Order Denying Reconsideration.
Bank of America, N.A. filed the lawsuit below against 
the Ryans on October 30, 2012. The complaint alleged that the Ryans had defaulted on a Note secured by a Mortgage on real 
property located on the island of Kaua# i. 
The Ryans were served with the complaint in March 2015. 
Terrence's answer was due on April 2, 2015. Lucille's answer was 
due on April 8, 2015. 
On March 23, 2015, a self-represented Terrence filed a 
motion requesting a 120-day extension of time to respond to the complaint.
3 Terrence's motion stated: 
Defendants currently reside in the State of Washington are
[sic] seeking assistance concerning this matter, but due totime, distance and resource limitations, Defendants have notbeen given the opportunity to adequately locate and retainlocal State of Hawaii counsel and consult with such counsel,and for this reason requests [sic] an additional 120 days torespond. 
Terrence's motion did not include a notice of hearing, as 
required by Rule 7 of the Rules of the Circuit Courts of the State of Hawai# i (RCCH).
4 He did not comply with RCCH Rule 7.2, 
which prescribes procedures for obtaining a hearing date and submitting copies of the motion to the assigned judge. The circuit court did not rule on the motion before the Ryans' answers became due. The Ryans did not answer the complaint. 
3 The motion also sought an extension of time for Lucille, but
Lucille did not sign the motion. Terrence, who is not licensed to practice
law in Hawai #i, could not have signed the motion on Lucille's behalf. See 
Oahu Plumbing & Sheet Metal, Ltd. v. Kona Constr., Inc., 60 Haw. 372, 377, 590P.2d 570, 573 (1979). The record does not indicate that Lucille requested anextension of time to answer the complaint. 
4 RCCH Rule 7(a) provides, in relevant part: 
Every motion, except one entitled to be heard ex parte, shall be
accompanied by a notice of hearing or of setting for hearingthereof.

Wilmington was substituted as the plaintiff on 
December 22, 2016.  On April 27, 2017, Wilmington requested, and 
the circuit court clerk entered, the Ryans' defaults.  The entry 
of default was served by mail upon the Ryans at the addresses 
where they were served with the complaint. 765
Wilmington moved for summary judgment and a decree of 
foreclosure (MSJ) on June 21, 2017. On August 31, 2017, the 
Ryans — through counsel — filed a memorandum in opposition. The 
Ryans did not submit affidavits or declarations in opposition to Wilmington's motion. They did not controvert that they signed the Note and the Mortgage. They did not controvert their default on the Note. They argued only that Wilmington failed to establish that Bank of America held the Note when it filed the complaint, citing Bank of Am., N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai# i 
361, 390 P.3d 1248 (2017). The Ryans did not move to set aside their defaults. 
During the hearing on Wilmington's MSJ the circuit 
court noted that the Ryans had not moved to set aside their defaults. 
The circuit court granted Wilmington's MSJ. The 
Foreclosure Decree and the Judgment were entered on September 20, 2017. 
The Ryans moved for reconsideration of the Foreclosure 
Decree and the Judgment (which was a judgment by default under 
5 The Note was endorsed in blank by Bank of America. Green Tree 
Servicing, LLC had been substituted as the plaintiff on September 18, 2014.
Ditech Financial LLC had been substituted as the plaintiff on July 20, 2016. 
6 Rule 55 of the Hawai #i Rules of Civil Procedure ( HRCP ) provides,
in relevant part: 
(a) Entry . When a party against whom a judgment for affirm-
ative relief is sought has failed to plead or otherwisedefend as provided by these rules and that fact is made toappear by affidavit or otherwise, the clerk shall enter theparty's default. 
7 On July 21, 2017, the circuit court entered an order granting the
motion for an extension of time "for an additional 120 days (July 21, 2015)from the date of filing of this motion." The Ryans did not answer thecomplaint even after entry of the July 21, 2017 order. They contend on appealthat the language of the order was ambiguous, and that they could reasonablyhave believed they had until November 14, 2017, to answer the complaint. This argument is contrary to the plain language of the order, and is without merit. 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRCP Rule 55(b)(2)). Their motion for reconsideration also 
requested (for the first time) that their defaults be set aside. The circuit court entered the Order Denying Reconsideration on December 8, 2017. This appeal followed. 
The Ryans raise three points on appeal: 
1. "The Circuit Court erred by granting the
Motion for Summary Judgment where[Wilmington] had failed to meet its primafacie burden of establishing standing"; 
2. "The Circuit Court erred by granting[Wilmington]'s Motion for Summary Judgmentbased on inadmissible hearsay"; and 
3. "The Circuit Court erred by denying the[Ryans] the opportunity to file an answer tothe Plaintiff's complaint, or alternativelyfor rehearing of [Wilmington]'s Motion forSummary Judgment and/or Default JudgmentAgainst all Defendants and for InterlocutoryDecree of Foreclosure where the Court's improper two year delay in filing its ordergranting the Defendant's [sic] Motion for anExtension of Time (to file a response toPlaintiff's complaint) confused the [Ryans]about when they were required to file ananswer to [the] complaint." 
(Original underscoring omitted.) We address these points in 
reverse order. 
1. The circuit court did not abuse its 
discretion by denying the Ryans' requestto set aside their defaults. 
The Ryans contend that the circuit court erred by 
failing to set aside their defaults. Their request was part of
their motion for reconsideration of the Foreclosure Decree and the Judgment. Denial of a motion to set aside an entry of  
default is reviewed for abuse of discretion. Chen v. Mah, 146 
Hawai# i 157, 172, 457 P.3d 796, 811 (2020). 
When the Ryans' motion for reconsideration was filed 
and decided, a defendant seeking to set aside an entry of default had to establish: (1) that the non-defaulting party will not be 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
prejudiced by the reopening, (2) that the defaulting party has a 
meritorious defense, and (3) that the default was not the result of inexcusable neglect or a wilful act. Chen, 146 Hawai# i at 
173, 457 P.3d at 812 (citing and prospectively abrogating BDM, Inc. v. Sageco, Inc., 57 Haw. 73, 76, 549 P.2d 1147, 1150 (1976)). 
The Ryans did not argue that Wilmington would not be 
prejudiced if their defaults were set aside. They did not claim to have a meritorious defense; they did not deny signing the Note or the Mortgage; they did not deny failing to make payments due on the Note; they did not contest the amount of their debt. Their motion was not supported by an affidavit or declaration explaining why their defaults were not the result of inexcusable neglect or a wilful act. We conclude that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion by denying the Ryans' request to set aside their defaults. See Deutsche Bank Nat'l Tr. Co. v. Tejada, 
No. 30654, 2011 WL 4840995, at *1 (Haw. App. Oct. 12, 2011) (SDO) ("Deutsche Bank correctly points out that in their Motion to Set Aside Default, the Tejadas did not address the first or third prongs of the BDM test."). 
2. The Ryans, being in default, lacked
standing to object to hearsay. 
In support of its motion for default judgment 
Wilmington proffered copies of the Note and other documents. 
The documents were authenticated by the declaration of CrystalHollins, an employee of Wilmington's loan servicer who stated she 
was familiar with the Ryans' loan documents. The Ryans contended 
that Hollins's declaration was hearsay. 
The Ryans were in default. A defendant in default 
"cannot contest the factual allegations of a plaintiff's claim for relief[.]" Chen, 146 Hawai# i at 167 n.9, 457 P.3d at 806 n.9 
(citing 10A Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure Civ. § 2688.1 (4th ed. 2019); see alsoBank of Hawaii v. Horwoth, 71 Haw. 204, 214–16, 787 P.2d 674, 680–81 (1990) (holding that once mortgagor's default is 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
established, mortgagor has no further standing to contest factual 
allegations of mortgagee's claim for relief); Kam Fui Tr. v. Brandhorst, 77 Hawai# i 320, 324-25, 884 P.2d 383, 387-88 (App. 
1994) (noting that entry of default "preclude[s] the defendant from making any further defense in the case so far as liability is concerned"). Being in default, the Ryans lacked standing to object to Wilmington's liability evidence. 
3. The Ryans waived their objection to
standing. 
The Ryans contend Wilmington failed to establish that 
Bank of America had standing to enforce the Note when it filed 
the complaint, as required by 
Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai# i at 368, 
390 P.3d at 1255 (noting that "standing must be present at the commencement of the case"). 
The contention lacks merit. 
The Ryans were in default. Bank of America's complaint 
alleged, among other things: 
6. On or about February 20, 2009, Defendants
TERRENCE RYAN and LUCILLE RYAN (collectively "Borrower"),
for value received, duly made, executed and delivered toBank of America, N.A., a National Banking Association, apromissory note ("Note") in the amount of $625,000.00. 
7. For the purpose of securing payment on the Note,
Borrower duly made, executed and delivered to Bank ofAmerica, N.A., a National Banking Association, a mortgage("Mortgage") encumbering the Property. The Mortgage wasrecorded on February 26, 2009 in the Bureau of Conveyancesof the State of Hawaii as Document No. 2009-028469. 
. . . . 
11. [Bank of America] is the holder of the Note and
record assignee of the Mortgage. 
These factual allegations — which the defaulted Ryans could not 
contest — established that Bank of America (the original lender) had standing to enforce the Note when it filed the complaint. 
The Ryans argue that "legal standing is a requirement 
that cannot be waived," citing McDermott v. Ige, 135 Hawai# i 275, 
283, 349 P.3d 382, 390 (2015), abrogated by Tax Found. of Haw. v. State, 144 Hawai# i 175, 439 P.3d 127 (2019). McDermott was 
abrogated by Tax Foundation (which was decided after briefing in 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
this appeal had been completed). In Tax Foundation the supreme 
court clarified that "standing is not an issue of subject matter jurisdiction, but arises solely out of justiciability concerns based on prudential concerns of judicial self-governance[.]" Id. 
at 192, 439 P.3d at 144 (footnote omitted). The supreme court also noted that "a claim of lack of standing can be waived." Id. 
at 191 n.21, 439 P.3d at 143 n.21 (first citing Ito v. Inv'rs Equity Life Holding Co., 135 Hawai# i 49, 59 n.24, 346 P.3d 118, 
128 n.24 (2015); and then citing In re Tax Appeal of Univ. of Haw. v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 102 Hawai# i 440, 445 n.13, 77 
P.3d 478, 483 n.13 (2003)). 
We conclude that the Ryans, by 
defaulting, waived the right to contest Bank of America's assertion in its complaint that it was "the holder of the Note and record assignee of the Mortgage." See also Chen, 146 Hawai
#i 
at 167 n.9, 457 P.3d at 806 n.9; Horwoth, 71 Haw. at 214–16, 787 P.2d at 680–81. 
For the foregoing reasons, the Foreclosure Decree and 
Judgment entered by the circuit court on September 20, 2017, and the Order Denying Reconsideration entered by the circuit court on December 8, 2017, are affirmed.
