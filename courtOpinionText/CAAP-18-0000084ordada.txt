APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
(S.P.P. NO. 17-1-0017(2))
ORDER
(By: Hiraoka, J., for the court )1
Upon consideration of the documents filed by self-
represented Petitioner-Appellant James K. Libero (Libero) titled
"Before Final Judgement: Libero's Opportunity to be Heard,"
received by the appellate clerk and electronically filed July 18,
2019, "Libero's Real Confession," received by the appellate clerk
and electronically filed July 22, 2019, "Regarding," received by
the appellate clerk and electronically filed August 12, 2019, and
"Regarding To: A Civil Right Action 42 U.S.C. 1983 Rule 38 Jury
Trial of Right," received by the appellate clerk and
electronically filed August 26, 2019, the papers in support, and
the record, it appears that:  
(1) Under the prison mailbox rule, an inmate's document
is deemed filed with the court upon delivery to prison officials
for mailing.  Setala v. J.C. Penney Co., 97 Hawai#i 484, 488-89,
40 P.3d 886, 890-91 (2002); 
1Ginoza, Chief Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.(2) The envelope containing the document electronically
filed July 18, 2019, indicates prison officials received the
envelope from Libero on July 12, 2019.  Therefore, Libero
effectively filed the document on July 12, 2019;
(3) In the document, Libero seeks reconsideration of
the summary disposition order, filed June 27, 2019; 
(4) A motion for reconsideration of the summary
disposition order was due on or before July 8, 2019.  See Hawai# i
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rules 26(a) (eff. 2010) &
40(a) (eff. 2000);
(5) The document delivered to prison officials for
mailing on July 12, 2019 is untimely as a motion for
reconsideration;
(6) The court construes the documents electronically
filed on July 22, 2019, August 12, 2019, and August 26, 2019 to
also be motions for reconsideration of the summary disposition
order, filed June 27, 2019;
(7) Libero is only entitled to one motion for
reconsideration.  See HRAP Rule 40(e) (eff. 2000);
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion for
reconsideration electronically filed July 18, 2019, is dismissed
as untimely, and the motions for reconsideration electronically
filed on July 22, 2019, August 12, 2019, and August 26, 2019 are
dismissed as impermissible successive motions for
reconsideration.
