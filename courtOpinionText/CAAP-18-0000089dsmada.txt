ORDER
GRANTING APRIL 18, 2018 MOTION TO DISMISS
APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
Upon review of (1) Employer/Appellee/Appellee
A Marketing Resource, LLC's (A Marketing Resource) and Insurance-
Carrier/Appellee/Appellee State Farm Insurance's (State Farm)
April 18, 2018 motion to dismiss appellate court case number
CAAP-18-0000089 for lack of appellate jurisdiction, (2) the
April 23, 2018 objection and memorandum by Claimant/Appellant/
Appellant Karen K. Abersold (Abersold), pro se, in response to
A Marketing Resource's and State Farm's April 18, 2018 motion,
and (3) the record, it appears that we lack appellate
jurisdiction over the Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Board's1 (LIRAB) two interlocutory orders that are the subject of
Abersold's appeal: (1) a January 10, 2018 order denying
Abersold's December 21, 2017 motion to summarily overturn the
Director of Labor and Industrial Relations' December 1, 2017
decision, and (2) a January 10, 2018 notice to the parties of a
January 29, 2018 initial conference, a July 19, 2018 settlement
conference, and an October 31, 2018 trial in LIRAB Case No. 
AB 2017-323.  As explained below, neither of these two 
January 10, 2018 interlocutory orders qualifies as an appealable
final order under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 386-88 (2015)
and HRS § 91-14(a) (2012 & Supp. 2017).
While HRS § 386-88 authorizes an appeal from a LIRAB
final order directly to this court, HRS § 91-14(a) governs the
appealability requirements for any LIRAB order. 
For purposes of HRS § 91-14(a), we have defined "final
order" to mean an order ending the proceedings, leaving
nothing further to be accomplished. . . .  Consequently, an
order is not final if the rights of a party involved remain
undetermined or if the matter is retained for further
action.
Bocalbos v. Kapiolani Med. Ctr., 89 Hawai #i 436, 439, 974 P.2d
1026, 1029 (1999) (citation and some internal quotation marks
omitted).  For the purpose of determining whether an order from a
workers' compensation matter is an appealable final order, the
Bocalbos court adopted the benefit rule (id. at 440, 974 P.2d at
1030) under which "an order that finally adjudicates a benefit or
penalty under the worker's compensation law is an appealable
final order under HRS § 91-14(a), although other issues remain." 
Lindinha v. Hilo Coast Processing Co. , 104 Hawai# i 164, 168, 
86 P.3d 973, 977 (2004) (citation omitted).  For example, "a
decision that finally adjudicates the matter of medical and
temporary disability benefits is an appealable final order under
HRS § 91-14(a), even though the matter of permanent disability
has been left for later determination."  Bocalbos , 89 Hawai #i at
443, 974 P.2d at 1033.

Relations Appeals Board appears to have been composed of Chair

C. Laderta in LIRAB Case No. AB 2017-323.
-2-NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
In contrast, when the LIRAB's determination of a
claimant's workers' compensation claim for benefits "has not been
made[,] . . . the requisite decree of finality is lacking with
respect to th[e] case[,]" and the appellate court lacks
jurisdiction.  Mitchell v. State Dep't. of Educ. , 77 Hawai #i 305,
308, 884 P.2d 368, 371 (1994) (citation omitted). 
In the instant case, neither of the two January 10,
2018 interlocutory orders finally adjudicates a benefit or
penalty under the worker's compensation law.  Instead, the two
January 10, 2018 orders are preliminary orders by the LIRAB. 
Consequently the two January 10, 2018 interlocutory orders lack
the requisite finality under HRS § 91-14(a) to qualify as
appealable final orders under HRS § 386-88.  Absent an appealable
final decision and order, we lack appellate jurisdiction, and
Abersold's appeal is premature.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that A Marketing
Resource and State Farm's April 18, 2018 motion to dismiss this
appeal is granted, and appellate court case number 
CAAP-18-0000089 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
