IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAII #
STATE OF HAWAI #I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
KEONI R. JAENTSCH, Defendant-Appellant.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CR. NO. 1FC161000066)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
Upon review of Defendant-Appellant Keone Jaentsch, aka
Keoni Jaentsch's (Jaentsch), appeal in appellate court case
number CAAP-18-0000090 from the jury's November 15, 2017 verdict
finding Jaentsch guilty of abuse of a household or family member
in violation of HRS § 709-906 (2014) in Case No. 1FC161000066,
the Honorable Rom A. Trader presiding, it appears that we lack
appellate jurisdiction under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 
§ 571-54 (2006) because the family court has not yet sentenced
Jaentsch.
"The right of appeal in a criminal case is purely
statutory[.]"  State v. Nicol , 140 Hawai #i 482, 485, 403 P.3d
259, 262 (2017) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
Jaentsch is asserting an appeal from the underlying first circuit
family court criminal case pursuant to HRS § 571-54, which
provides that "[a]n interested party aggrieved by any order or
decree of the court may appeal to the intermediate appellate
court for review of questions of law and fact upon the same terms
and conditions as in other cases in the circuit court and reviewNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
shall be governed by chapter 602[.]"  HRS § 602-57(1) (2016)
provides that the Hawai# i Intermediate Court of Appeals has
jurisdiction "[t]o hear and determine appeals from any court or
agency when appeals are allowed by law[.]"  The law that allows
appeals from circuit court criminal cases is HRS § 641-11 (2016),
which provides that "[a]ny party aggrieved by the judgment of a
circuit court in a criminal matter may appeal to the intermediate
appellate court, subject to chapter 602, in the manner and within
the time provided by the rules of court.  The sentence of the
court in a criminal case shall be the judgment."  Thus, "[u]nder
HRS § 641-11, the sentence of the court in a criminal case is the
judgment from which an appeal is authorized[,]" and where
"[t]here [is] no conviction and sentence in . . . [a] case, there
can be no appeal under HRS § 641-11[.]"  State v. Kealaiki , 95
Hawai#i 309, 312, 22 P.3d 588, 591 (2001) (internal quotation
marks and citations omitted).
In the instant case, the family court has not yet
concluded the sentencing of Jaentsch, and, thus, the family court
has not yet entered an appealable judgment as HRS § 571-54
requires for an appeal.  Consequently, Jaentsch's appeal is
premature, and the Hawai #i Intermediate Court of Appeals lacks
appellate jurisdiction.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED appellate court case
number CAAP-18-0000090 is dismissed for lack of appellate
jurisdiction.
