IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v. 
FRED E. HOFER, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 3DTC-17-013008) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Reifurth and Chan, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Fred E. Hofer (Hofer), 
pro se
, 
appeals from a Judgment and Notice of Entry of Judgment, entered 
on January 25, 2018, by the District Court of the Third Circuit (district court).
1 The district court convicted Hofer of one 
count of Driving Without a Valid Driver's License, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 286-102, and one count of No 
Motor Vehicle Insurance, in violation of HRS § 431:10C-104. 
On appeal, Hofer contends he is a "duly naturalized 
Subject to this Kingdom" and asserts points of error that: the 
district court violated his due process rights as it lacked jurisdiction over him because the State of Hawai# i is "a mere 
fabrication, a fiction"; Hofer never submitted to the jurisdiction of the district court; the State of Hawai# i, as 
1 The Honorable M. Kanani Laubach presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
represented by the prosecuting attorney and by the filing of this 
case, violated his rights by not vacating the case as he requested; and the district court and prosecuting attorney violated their oath of office by holding proceedings without authority or jurisdiction. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve Hofer's points of error as follows and affirm. 
In State v. Kaulia, 128 Hawai# i 479, 486-87, 291 P.3d 
377, 384-85 (2013), the defendant argued "the courts of the State of Hawai# i lacked subject matter jurisdiction over his criminal 
prosecution because the defense proved the existence of the Hawaiian Kingdom and the illegitimacy of the State of Hawai# i 
government." 
The Hawai# i Supreme Court rejected Kaulia's claim 
and held as follows: 
Pursuant to HRS § 701–106 (1993), "the [S]tate's criminal
jurisdiction encompasses all areas within the territorialboundaries of the State of Hawai #i." State v. Jim, 105
Hawai #i 319, 330, 97 P.3d 395, 406 (App.2004). The State
charged Kaulia based on his conduct in Kona, County andState of Hawai #i
. Thus Kaulia is subject to the State's
criminal jurisdiction in this case. 
Kaulia appears to argue that he is immune from the
court's jurisdiction because of the legitimacy of theKingdom government. In that regard, we reaffirm that"[w]hatever may be said regarding the lawfulness" of itsorigins, "the State of Hawai #i . . . is now, a lawful
government." State v. Ferqerstrom, 106 Hawai #i
 43, 55, 101
P.3d 652, 664 (App. 2004), aff #d, 106 Hawai #i 41, 101 P.3d
225 (2004). Individuals claiming to be citizens of theKingdom and not of the State are not exempt from applicationof the State's laws. See id. at 55, 101 P.3d at 664; State v. Lorenzo, 77 Hawai #i 219, 883 P.2d 641 (App. 1994); State 
v. French, 77 Hawai #i 222, 883 P.2d 644 (App. 1994);
Nishitani v. Baker, 82 Hawai #i 281, 921 P.2d 1182 (App.
1996); State v. Lee, 90 Hawai #i 130, 976 P.2d 444 (1999). 
Thus we also reject Kaulia's argument that the circuit
court erred in precluding Kaulia from calling a witness topresent evidence concerning the existence of the Kingdom insupport of his Motion to Dismiss. 
Id. at 487, 291 P.3d at 385. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Here, Hofer was cited for offenses in the County of 
Hawai# i, and similar to Kaulia, he is subject to the State's 
criminal jurisdiction. 
Moreover, to the extent that Hofer refers to 
proceedings before the district court, the record on appeal does 
not contain any transcripts of proceedings. "[T]he burden is upon appellant in an appeal to show error by reference to matters in the record, and he or she has the responsibility of providing an adequate transcript." 
In re RGB, 123 Hawai# i 1, 27, 229 P.3d 
1066, 1092 (2010) (brackets omitted) (quoting Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai
#i 225, 230, 909 P.2d 553, 558 (1995)). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment and 
Notice of Entry of Judgment, entered on January 25, 2018, by the District Court of the Third Circuit, is affirmed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, May 8, 2019.
