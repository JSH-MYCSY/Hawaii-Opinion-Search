APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 13-1-202K) NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND 
DENYING IN PART MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Nakasone, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of Defendants-Appellants Isabelo 
Pacpaco Domingo and Michele Elanor Domingo's (Domingos) "Motion 
for Reconsideration of the Court's July 14, 2022 Summary 
Disposition Order" (Motion for Reconsideration) filed on July 25, 
2022, the papers in support, and the record, the court determines 
that reconsideration is warranted in part regarding section II.B. of the Summary Disposition Order and thus an Amended Summary Disposition Order will be filed. However, reconsideration is otherwise denied as unwarranted under Rule 40(b) of the Hawai# i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure, and because the Motion for Reconsideration asserts arguments and presents evidence that could have but were not presented in opposition to the Motion to Dismiss Appeal filed on April 1, 2022. See Sousaris v. Miller, 
92 Hawai# i 505, 513, 993 P.2d 539, 547 (2000) ("Reconsideration 
is not a device to . . . raise arguments or evidence that could and should have been brought during the earlier proceeding."). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion for 
Reconsideration is granted in part and denied in part. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, August 26, 2022.
