OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
JAMES ARTHUR, Claimant-Appellant,
v.
CJ PETERSON SERVICES, INC., Employer-Appellee,
and
HAWAII EMPLOYERS' MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY, INC.,
Insurance Carrier-Appellee.
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
(CASE NO. AB 2015-147 (DCD No. 2-11-05087))
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL WITHOUT PREJUDICE
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
Upon consideration of Claimant-Appellant James Arthur's
(Arthur) March 1, 2018 Motion for Extension of Time to File
Notice of Appeal (Motion), the papers in support, and the record,
it appears that: 
(1) This is an appeal from the Labor and Industrial
Relations Appeals Board's (LIRAB) January 22, 2018 Decision and
Order in the underlying case, Case No. AB 2015-147, DCD 
No. 2-11-05087; 
(2) "[W]hen a civil appeal is permitted by law, the
notice of appeal shall be filed within 30 days after entry of the
judgment or appealable order."  Hawai# i Rules of Appellate
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 4(a)(1);
(3) A notice of appeal from the LIRAB's January 22,
2018 Decision and Order was due on or before February 21, 2018;NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(4) Arthur filed the notice of appeal on February 22,
2018; 
(5) Arthur acknowledges the notice of appeal was due on
or before February 21, 2018, but seeks a first extension of time
to file the notice of appeal because her counsel's "honest, but
mistaken counting of the days," and "imprudent" reliance upon
office staff to determine the notice of appeal due date without
"double checking the date," constitutes excusable neglect; and
(6) "As a general rule, compliance with the requirement
of timely filing a notice of appeal is jurisdictional, and we
must dismiss an appeal on our motion if we lack jurisdiction." 
Grattafiori v. State , 79 Hawaii 10, 13, 897 P.2d 937, 940 (1995)
(quotation marks and citations omitted).  The notice of appeal is
untimely and thus, the court lacks appellate jurisdiction.  In
addition, HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B) requires a motion for an extension
of time to file a notice of appeal after the prescribed time
expires, be filed in the court or agency appealed from .  See also
HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or justice is authorized to
change the jurisdictional requirements contained in Rule 4 of
[the HRAP].").  This court lacks jurisdiction to decide the
instant Motion.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is
dismissed without prejudice to Arthur seeking relief in the
underlying case and, if such relief is granted, timely filing a
new notice of appeal.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, March 5, 2018.
