THE COUNTY OF MAUI; THE COUNTY OF MAUI, by and
through WILLIAM SPENCE, as DIRECTOR OF PLANNING, and
BRIAN BILBERRY, DEPUTY CORPORATION COUNSEL WITH THE

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 17-1-0208) 
ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION 
(By: Ginoza, C.J., and Wadsworth and Nakasone, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of the May 10, 2022 Motion for 
Reconsideration filed by self-represented Requestor-Appellant 
Christopher Salem (Appellant), the papers in support, and the 
record, and the May 11, 2022 "Letter to the Honorable Court" 
filed by Appellant, which we construe as a motion for leave to file the Motion for Reconsideration one day late (Motion for 
Leave), and the papers in support, it appears that: 
(1) Appellant requests reconsideration of this court's 
Summary Disposition Order, filed on April 29, 2022; 
(2) Appellant did not file the Motion for 
Reconsideration on or before May 9, 2022, i.e., within ten days 
after the filing of the Summary Disposition Order, as required by Hawai#i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 40; 
(3) Appellant requests that we accept the late-filed 
Motion for Reconsideration due to electronic "filing challenges" NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
that Appellant encountered on the evening of May 9, 2022, and in 
light of his self-represented status; and 
(4) This court did not overlook or misapprehend any 
point of law or fact when it issued its April 29, 2022 Summary Disposition Order. See HRAP Rule 40(b). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion for 
Leave is granted. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Motion for 
Reconsideration is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, May 19, 2022.
