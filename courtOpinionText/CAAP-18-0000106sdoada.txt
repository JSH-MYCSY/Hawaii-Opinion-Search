NOA MAU-ESPIRITO and CHARLES D. HEPA,
Defendants-Appellants,

nd 
KAIPOLANI MAU-ESPIRITO, also known as
KA-IPOLANI MAU ESPIRITO, Defendant 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 5RC-17-1-0463) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, and Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.) 
Defendants-Appellants Noa K. Mau-Espirito and Charles 
D. Hepa (collectively, "Appellants")/ appeal, pro se, from the 
Order Re: Ejectment and the Writ of Ejectment/ ("Writ") entered 
by the District Court of the Fifth Circuit ("District Court")/ 321
1
/ Kaipolani Mau-Espirito, although a defendant in the case below, is
not included and did not join in the notice of appeal, and therefore is not a
party to this appeal. 
2/ The Appellants state that they appeal from a Writ of Ejectment dated
January 23, 2016. We understand Appellants to mean that they appeal from the
Writ issued on January 26, 2018 by the District Court. 
3/ The Honorable Michael K. Soong presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
on January 26, 2018, in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee Coco Palms 
Hui LLC ("Coco Palms"). 
The Appellants' opening briefs fail to comply with 
Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure ("HRAP") Rule 28 in numerous 
respects. Nevertheless, we have "consistently adhered to the policy of affording litigants the opportunity to have their case heard on the merits, where possible." Marvin v. Pflueger
, 127 
Hawai# i 490, 496, 280 P.3d 88, 94 (2012) (quoting Morgan v. 
Planning Dep't, County of Kauai, 104 Hawai# i 173, 180-81, 86 P.3d 
982, 989-90 (2004)) (internal quotations marks omitted). Accordingly, we construe Appellants' singular point of error to be that the District Court lacked jurisdiction over this case because the Kingdom of Hawai# i is not a part of the United 
States. Appellants do not make any other discernible arguments. See Kakinami v. Kakinami, 127 Hawai# i 126, 144 n.16, 276 P.3d 
695, 713 n.16 (2012) (citing In re Guardianship of Carlsmith, 113 Hawai# i 236, 246, 151 P.3d 717, 727 (2007) (noting that this 
court may disregard a contention where there is no discernible argument in support of it)). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the arguments they advance and the issues they raise, as well as the relevant statutory and case law, we address Appellants' point of error as follows and affirm. 
"This court has repeatedly held that claims involving 
the applicability of the Kingdom of Hawai# i laws are without 
merit." State ex rel. Dep't. of Hawaiian Home Lands v. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Kawa# auhau, No. CAAP-12-0000364, 2012 WL 5971176, at *1 (Haw. Ct. 
App. Nov. 29, 2012). "The sovereignty of the State and its 
lawful jurisdiction over the inhabitants of the State is a matter of law that is well-established." State v. Kaluau, No. 30460, 
2011 WL 3805761, at *1 (Haw. Ct. App. Aug. 29, 2011) (citing State v. Fergerstrom, 106 Hawai# i 43, 55, 101 P.3d 652, 664 (App. 
2004)). 
Therefore, the Order Re: Ejection and the Writ of 
Ejectment entered on January 26, 2018, in the District Court of Fifth Circuit is affirmed.
