STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
LANCE KAMUELA GOMES, Defendant-Appellant,
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 5CPC-17-0000062)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the appeal of Defendant-Appellant Lance
 
Gomes (
Gomes) in appellate court case number CAAP-18-0000109, it
 
appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction over Gomes' appeal
 
apparently from (1) the actions taken and the bench warrant
 issued by the Honorable Randal G. B. Valenciano on October 12,
 2017, (2) the October 25, 2017 actions of a police officer
 presumably related to the bench warrant, (3) Gomes' arrest on
 October 28, 2017, presumably on the bench warrant, and (4) Gomes'
 detention on October 31, 2017, and the January 11, 2018 circuit
 court oral order reflected in court minutes to set jury trial
 deadlines. The aforesaid actions or rulings are not eligible for
 appellate review under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-11
 
(2016) in the absence of a timely appeal from an appealable final 
NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
judgment of conviction or final order of dismissal. Therefore,
 
dismissal of the appeal for lack of jurisdiction is warranted.
 
The proceedings underlying this appeal involve a 
criminal complaint by Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai' i (State) 
against Gomes for (1) one count of criminal property damage in the third degree in violation of HRS § 708-822 (2014), and (2) one count of criminal trespass in the second degree in violation of HRS § 708-814 (2017). "The right of appeal in a criminal case is purely statutory[.]" State v. Nicol, 140 Hawai' i 482, 485, 
403 P.3d 259, 262 (2017) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). HRS § 641-11 provides that "[a]ny party aggrieved by the judgment of a circuit court in a criminal matter may appeal to the intermediate appellate court, subject to chapter 602, in the manner and within the time provided by the rules of court. The sentence of the court in a criminal case shall be the judgment." Thus, "[u]nder HRS § 641-11, the sentence of the court in a criminal case is the judgment from which an appeal is authorized[,]" and where "[t]here [is] no conviction and sentence in . . . [a] case, there can be no appeal under HRS § 641-11[.]" State v. Kealaiki, 95 Hawai' i 309, 312, 22 P.3d 588, 591 (2001) 
(internal quotation marks and citations omitted); State v. Johnston, 63 Haw. 9, 11, 619 P.2d 1076, 1077 (1980); State v. Ferreira, 54 Haw. 485, 486-87, 510 P.2d 88, 89 (1973). In determining whether an order or judgment qualifies for appealability under HRS § 641-11, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i 
has "focused the inquiry on whether the relevant order terminated the proceedings in the case and left nothing further to be accomplished by the lower court." Nicol, 140 Hawai' i at 492, 403 
P.3d at 269. 
None of the appealed actions or rulings in appellate
 
court case number CAAP-18-0000109 is independently appealable. 
The bench warrant is an interlocutory order that did not
 terminate the proceedings in the case. With respect to any
 actions and orders contained in the circuit court minutes, "a 
2
    NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
minute order is not an appealable order." Abrams v. Cades, 
Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai' i 319, 321 n.3, 966 P.2d 631, 
633 n.3 (1998).1 
Therefore, we lack appellate jurisdiction over Gomes'
 
premature appeal. IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case
 
number CAAP-18-0000109 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.

 "Generally, the filing of a notice of appeal divests the trial court
of jurisdiction over the appealed case." TSA International Limited v. Shimizu 
Corporation, 92 Hawai 'i 243, 265, 990 P.2d 713, 735 (1999) (citations

valid under the applicable statutory provisions and procedural rules. Where 
the notice of appeal is jurisdictionally defective, filing the notice does nottransfer jurisdiction from the trial court to the appellate court." State v. 
Ontiveros, 82 Hawai 'i 446, 449, 923 P.2d 388, 391 (citations omitted; emphasis
