NO. CAAP-18-0000110
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
LANCE K. GOMES, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 5DCC-17-0000454)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, we lack appellate
 
jurisdiction over Defendant-Appellant Lance K. Gomes's (Gomes),
 
pro se, appeal in appellate court case number CAAP-18-0000110. 
It appears that Gomes appeals from a January 14, 2018
 interlocutory order by the District Court of the Fifth Circuit
 acknowledging Gomes's plea of not guilty to Plaintiff-Appellee
 State of Hawaii's (the State) citation for criminal trespass in
 the second degree in violation of HRS § 708-814 (Supp. 2017), and
 scheduling Gomes's bench trial in district court criminal case
 number 5DCC-17-0000454 for March 15, 2018.
 
"The right to an appeal is strictly statutory." State
 
v. Ontiveros, 82 Hawai' i 446, 449, 923 P.2d 388, 391 (1996) 
(citation omitted). HRS § 641-12(a)(2016) provides that "[a]ppeals upon the record shall be allowed from all final decisions and final judgments of district courts in all criminal matters." "[I]n order to appeal a criminal matter in the district court, the appealing party must appeal from a written NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
judgment or order that has been filed with the clerk of the court 
pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(b)(3)." State v. Bohannon, 102 Hawai' i 
228, 236, 74 P.3d 980, 988 (2003); see also Rule 32(c)(2) of the Hawai'i Rules of Penal Procedure. And even when the district 
court enters a judgment of conviction, "[j]udgments of conviction are not final unless they include the final adjudication and the final sentence." State v. Kilborn, 109 Hawai' i 435, 442, 127 
P.3d 95, 102 (App. 2005) (dismissing an appeal from a district court judgment of conviction that did not finally determine the entire sentence). 
In the instant case, it appears that the district court
 
did not hold a bench trial on March 15, 2018, and, instead, the
 district court continued the bench trial. In short, there is no
 appealable final judgment, the January 14, 2018 interlocutory
 order is not eligible for appellate review, and Gomes's appeal is
 premature.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
 
case number CAAP-18-0000110 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
