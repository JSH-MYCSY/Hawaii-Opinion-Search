IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI #I, Appellee,
v.
MAHEALANI HANIE-GRACE, Appellant.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
(BBRA NO. 50-0028031)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
appellate jurisdiction over pro se Appellant Mahealani Hanie-
Grace's ("Hanie-Grace") appeal in appellate court case number
CAAP-18-0000113, apparently from her alleged arrest on February
22, 2018, because Hanie-Grace is not appealing from any existing
district court case involving her, much less a final judgment or
final order.  Hanie-Grace alleges she has been ordered to appear
in district court in Lihue, Kauai.
"The right to an appeal is strictly statutory."  State
v. Ontiveros, 82 Hawai# i 446, 449, 923 P.2d 388, 391 (1996)
(citation omitted).  The Hawai #i Intermediate Court of Appeals
has jurisdiction "[t]o hear and determine appeals from any court
or agency when appeals are allowed by law[.]"  HRS ยง 602-57(1)
(2016).
The statute governing appeals from district court
criminal cases is HRS ยง 641-12(a) (2016), which provides that
"[a]ppeals upon the record shall be allowed from all final NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
decisions and final judgments of district courts in all criminal
matters."  Consequently, "in order to appeal a criminal matter in
the district court, the appealing party must appeal from a
written judgment or order that has been filed with the clerk of
the court pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(b)(3)."  State v. Bohannon, 102
Hawai#i 228, 236, 74 P.3d 980, 988 (2003); see also  Rule 32(c)(2)
of the Hawai# i Rules of Penal Procedure.
The statute governing appeals from district court civil
cases is HRS ยง 641-1(a) (2016), under which
appeals are allowed in civil matters from all final
judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit and district
courts.  In district court cases, a judgment includes any
order from which an appeal lies. . . .  A final order means
an order ending the proceeding, leaving nothing further to
be accomplished. . . .  When a written judgment, order, or
decree ends the litigation by fully deciding all rights and
liabilities of all parties, leaving nothing further to be
adjudicated, the judgment, order, or decree is final and
appealable.
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai# i 425, 426, 984 P.2d 1251,
1252 (1999) (citations, internal quotation marks, and footnote
omitted; emphases added).
Regardless whether Hanie-Grace's alleged facts will
result in her becoming a named party in a criminal case or a
civil case, a final judgment or final order that reflects the
district court's final decision is a prerequisite for appellate
review.  In the instant appeal, there is no evidence that Hanie-
Grace is a named party in any current district court case, nor is
there evidence of a final judgment or final order in a currently
existing case that reflects a final decision by the district
court that aggrieved Hanie-Grace.  Therefore, Hanie-Grace's
notice of appeal is jurisdictionally defective under these
circumstances. 
In the absence of an appealable final judgment or
order, we lack appellate jurisdiction, and Hanie-Grace's appeal
is premature.
