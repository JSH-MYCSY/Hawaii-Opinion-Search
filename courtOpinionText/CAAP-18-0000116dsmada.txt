IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI #I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
KIMBERLY SOUZA, Defendant-Appellant.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
(CASE NO. 5DCW-18-0000104)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
appellate jurisdiction over the appeal by Defendant-Appellant
Kimberly Souza (Appellant), pro se, from district court case 
no. 5DCW-18-0000104.
"The right to an appeal is strictly statutory."  State
v. Ontiveros, 82 Hawai# i 446, 449, 923 P.2d 388, 391 (1996)
(citation omitted).   "Appeals upon the record shall be allowed
from all final decisions and final judgments of district courts
in all criminal matters.  Such appeals may be made to the
intermediate appellate court, subject to chapter 602, whenever
the party appealing shall file notice of the party's appeal
within thirty days, or such other time as may be provided by the
rules of the court."  HRS ยง 641-12.   "[I]n order to appeal a
criminal matter in the district court, the appealing party must NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
appeal from a written judgment or order that has been filed with
the clerk of the court pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(b)(3)."  State v.
Bohannon, 102 Hawai# i 228, 236, 74 P.3d 980, 988 (2003); see also
HRPP Rule 32(c)(2).
There is no written judgment or order filed with the
clerk of the court that constitutes a final judgment or decision
in the case.  Therefore, Appellant's appeal is premature and this
court lacks appellate jurisdiction.  
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is dismissed for
lack of appellate jurisdiction.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, June 26, 2018.
