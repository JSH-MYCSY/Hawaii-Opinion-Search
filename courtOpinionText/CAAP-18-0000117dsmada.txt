IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I  
COCO PALMS HUI LLC, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
NOA K. MAU-ESPIRITO and CHARLES D. HEPA,
Defendants-Appellants,
and
 
KAIPOLANI MAU-ESPIRITO aka KA-IPOLANI MAU-ESPIRITO,
Defendant-Appellee.
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 5RC-17-1-0463)
 
ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS
 
APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Chan, JJ.) 
Upon review of (1) Plaintiff-Appellee Coco Palms Hui,
 
LLC's (Coco Palms Hui), June 22, 2018 motion to dismiss appellate
 
court case number CAAP-18-0000117 for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction, (2) the lack of any memorandum by Defendants-
Appellants Noa K. Mau-Espirito (Mau-Espirito) and Charles D. Hepa
 (Hepa) in response to Coco Palms Hui's June 22, 2018 motion, and
 (3) the record, it appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction
 over this appeal from the Honorable Edmund Acoba's March 27, 2018
 "Order Granting the Honorable Michael K. Soong's (Judge Soong)
 Motion to Strike Default Judgment and Notice of Entry of Default
 Judgment Filed on February 5, 2018" that Mau-Espirito and Hepa
 had filed in Civil No. 5RC-17-0463, because the district court
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
has not yet entered the final judgment on the last remaining
 
substantive issue in Civil No. 5RC-17-0463.
 
Pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a) (2016),
 
appeals are allowed in civil matters from all final
judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit and district
courts. In district court cases, a judgment includes any
order from which an appeal lies. A final order means an
 
order ending the proceeding, leaving nothing further to be
accomplished. When a written judgment, order, or decree
ends the litigation by fully deciding all rights and
liabilities of all parties, leaving nothing further to be
adjudicated, the judgment, order, or decree is final and
appealable.
 
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai' i 425, 426, 984 P.2d 1251, 
1252 (1999) (citations, internal quotation marks, and footnote
 
omitted; emphases added). The Supreme Court of Hawai
'i 
has promulgated separate rules governing civil procedure in
the district courts . . . . DCRCP Rule 58 (1996), in
contrast to HRCP Rule 58, does not by its plain language
require that judgment be set forth on a "separate document."
Thus, the requirements set forth in Jenkins [v. Cades
Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawaii 115, 869 P.2d 1334
(1994)], are not applicable to district court cases.
Consequently, an order that fully disposes of an action in
the district court may be final and appealable without the
entry of judgment on a separate document, as long as the
appealed order ends the litigation by fully deciding the
rights and liabilities of all parties and leaves nothing
further to be adjudicated.
 
Id. at 427, 984 P.2d at 1253 (footnote and citation omitted;
 
emphasis added). The district court has not yet entered a final
 
judgment that fully decided the rights and liabilities of the
 parties, and, thus, ended the proceedings, leaving nothing
 further for the district court to accomplish in this case. At
 the present time, Mau-Espirito and Hepa's appeal from the
 March 27, 2018 order is premature, and we lack appellate
 jurisdiction.
