Court's: 
(1) March 29, 2018 "Order Denying [Octagon's] Motion 
for Reconsideration and Relief from Judgment Filed on January 29, 2018"; 
(2) December 18, 2017 Judgment for Possession;

(1) May 1, 2018 "Order Granting [MHS's] Ex Parte Motion for Writ of Execution"; and 
(2) May 1, 2018 Writ of Execution.
4/ 
On appeal, Octagon contends that the District Court 
erred: (1) in entering judgment by default against Octagon when the court allegedly lacked personal jurisdiction over Octagon because it was not adequately served; (2) in entering judgment by default against Octagon when the court allegedly lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the action because the parties had contractually limited the forum for any dispute to the "Second Circuit Court"; (3) in entering judgment against Octagon when there was no evidentiary basis for breach of the parties' lease due to a force majeure clause in the lease; (4) in entering the Default Judgment against Octagon ex parte, without a proof hearing to determine the actual amount of any damages; and (5) in entering the Default Judgment against Octagon when it exceeded the amount requested in MHS's pleading. Octagon further contends that each of the above alleged errors violated Octagon's federal and state due process rights.

legal authorities, and giving due consideration to the issues

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
raised and the arguments advanced by the parties, we resolve 
Octagon's contentions as follows: 
(1) Octagon contends that the District Court lacked 
personal jurisdiction over Octagon because Octagon "was not served adequately by posting in the absence of the exercise of due diligence" or, alternatively, that the District Court erroneously denied an evidentiary hearing on the issue of MHS's due diligence. MHS argues that the service by posting complied with the court's order authorizing the manner of service, which was issued pursuant to applicable state law. 
On December 11, 2017, Octagon failed to appear before 
the District Court to answer the October 20, 2017 "Complaint (Assumpsit-Summary Possession/Landlord - Tenant, Damages)" (Complaint). The District Court entered default against Octagon, 
granted a judgment for possession and writ of possession, and 
directed MHS to file an ex parte motion for damages. The Judgment for Possession and Writ of Possession were entered on December 18, 2017. On or about January 24, 2018, MHS submitted its Ex Parte Motion for Default Judgment (Motion for Default 
Judgment) to the District Court. The Default Judgment was signed 
by the court on January 26, 2018, and entered on January 30, 
2018. 
Octagon first raised the personal jurisdiction issue in 
its January 29, 2018 motion for reconsideration and relief from judgment (First Motion for Reconsideration), which sought to set 
aside the Judgment for Possession and Writ of Possession pursuant 
to District Court Rules of Civil Procedure (DCRCP) Rules 4(d), 
59(e) and 60(b)(4).
5/ Octagon raised the personal jurisdiction 
issue again in its February 9, 2018 motion for reconsideration 
and relief from default judgment (Second Motion for 
Reconsideration), which sought to set aside the Default Judgment 
pursuant to the same DCRCP rules. 
DCRCP Rule 59(e) motions for reconsideration are 
reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard. Yoshimura v. 
5/ We note that the First Motion for Reconsideration was not made 
within ten days of the Judgment for Possession and Writ of Possession,
pursuant to DCRCP Rule 59(e). We thus construe the First Motion for Reconsideration as a DCRCP Rule 60(b)(4) motion.

126 Hawai# i 190, 197, 268 P.3d 443, 450 (App. 2011) (citing 
Citicorp Mortg., Inc., 94 Hawai# i at 430, 16 P.3d at 835). 
The record reflects the following regarding service of 
process in this case: 
MHS and Octagon, as landlord and tenant, 
respectively, entered into the Lease for Maui Harbor Shops (Lease
), dated October 17, 2016, under which Octagon leased the 
premises at 300 Ma# alaea Road, #1C/CS & 1E, Wailuku, Hawai# i  (300 
Ma#alaea Road Address). At all relevant times, Octagon was a 
Nevada corporation and Dr. Jon Van Cleave (Van Cleave) was the 
owner and President of Octagon. Van Cleave was also Octagon's 
registered agent for service of process, with an address of 83 Kainehe Place, Kihei, HI 96753 (83 Kainehe Place Address). 
On or about November 14, 2017, MHS submitted to the 
District Court an Ex Parte Motion for Service of Process by Posting and by Certified Mail (Motion re Service
).  The Motion re 
4   
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Service listed three "Attempted Service Dates" — October 30, 
November 3, and November 8, 2017 — for service of process on Octagon, via its "registered agent . . . Van Cleave," at the 83Kainehe Place Address. The Motion re Service cited Hawaii  
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 666-8 (quoted infra) and was supported 
by a process server's declaration, dated November 9, 2017. The 
process server's declaration stated in relevant part: 
I attempted service on the Attempted Service Dates at the
. . . Other Address(es) listed on page 1 [ i.e., the 83
Kainehe Place Address], that are the only known address(es)
for Defendant(s). I have checked the telephone directory ofthis circuit and I have not been able to find any otheraddress for Defendant(s). Despite my efforts, I have notbeen able to locate and serve said Defendant(s). I am informed and believe that Defendant(s) continues to resideand/or do business in the State of Hawai #i but is avoiding
service of process. 
On November 20, 2017, the District Court filed its 
order granting the Motion re Service (Order re Service), which 
stated in relevant part: 
NOW, THEREFORE, YOU ARE COMMANDED to leave certified
copies of this Motion and the Complaint for Summary
Possession with some agent or employee of Defendant(s),provided an agent or employee can be found upon the premisesor elsewhere within the circuit, and also to affix in aconspicuous place upon the certain premises located atPremises Address listed on page 1, certified copies of thisMotion and the Complaint for Summary Possession, suchposting to be not less than ten (l0) days before the returndate, and make due return of this Order with what you havedone endorsed thereon. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Plaintiff send to 
Defendant(s), by certified mail, return-receipt requested,certified copies of this Motion and the Complaint forSummary Possession and file in these proceedings adeclaration of the certified mail in the appropriate form. 
(Emphasis omitted.) 
On November 30, 2017, MHS filed two returns of service 
both indicating that Octagon had been "[s]erved by [p]osting per 
Court Order." 
The first return of service stated that the 
Complaint, Motion re Service, and other documents were posted at the 300 Ma# alaea Road Address on November 22, 2017, and included 
photographs that appeared to show the posting on the door of the premises. 
The second return of service stated that the 
Complaint, Motion re Service, and other documents were posted at the 83 Kainehe Place Address on November 22, 2017, and included 
5   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
photographs that appeared to show the posting on the door of a 
residential property. Additionally, a later declaration and supporting exhibits filed by counsel for MHS showed that counsel had sent, via certified mail on November 20, 2017, a copy of the "Summons and Complaint" to Van Cleave at the 83 Kainehe Place Address, which mail apparently went unclaimed for some weeks before being returned to sender on January 4, 2018. 
Under Hawai# i law, 
it is service of process, not actual knowledge of the
commencement of the action which confers jurisdiction.Otherwise a defendant could never object to the sufficiencyof service of process, since he must have knowledge of thesuit in order to make such objection. . . . The crux of the matter is not whether [a] defendant has knowledge of theaction but whether it has been put to the defendant, in theproper way, that he must appear and defend or be in default.

DCRCP Rule 4(d)(3)
6/ provides that a summons and 
6/ DCRCP Rule 4 states, in relevant part: 
(d) [Summons]: Personal service. The summons and 
complaint shall be served together. The plaintiff shall
furnish the person making service with such copies as arenecessary. Service shall be made as follows: 
. . . . 
(3)
 Upon a domestic or foreign corporation or upon a
partnership or other unincorporated association which issubject to suit under a common name, by delivering a copy ofthe summons and of the complaint to an officer, a managingor general agent, or to any other agent authorized byappointment or by law to receive service of process and, ifthe agent is one authorized by statute to receive serviceand the statute so requires, by also mailing a copy to thedefendant.

complaint shall be served together upon a corporation "by 
delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint to an officer, a managing or general agent, or to any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process and, if the agent is one authorized by statute to receive service and the statute so requires, by also mailing a copy to the defendant." Under DCRCP Rule (4)(d)(8), when a defendant is a corporation, "it is also sufficient if the summons and complaint are served in the manner prescribed by any statute." (Emphasis added.) 
One such manner of service is prescribed in HRS § 666-8 
(2016), which addresses service of process in summary possession proceedings. Section 666-8 states, in relevant part: 
Service. The summons shall be served as provided by
the rules of court. 
. . . . 
If any defendant cannot be served with process within
the State, and the facts shall appear by affidavit or
otherwise to the satisfaction of the court, service as tosuch defendant may be made according to the special order ofthe court, but such order shall in any case include adirection to the officer to leave a certified copy of thecomplaint and summons with some agent or employee of matureyears of the defendant, provided the agent or employee canbe found upon the premises or elsewhere within the circuit,and also to affix in a conspicuous place upon the premises(as upon the wall of any store, shop, dwelling, or otherbuilding thereon, and if there is no such building, thenupon some other permanent object thereon, as a tree orfence) a certified copy of the complaint and summons. 
The 
order shall further require that a certified copy of thecomplaint and summons be sent to the defendant by certifiedor registered mail, postage prepaid, unless it is shown byaffidavit or otherwise to the satisfaction of the court that the address of the defendant is unknown and cannot be ascertained. 
Here, Octagon argues that "no attempt at adequate 
service was even made." The record shows, however, MHS's 
repeated efforts to serve Octagon through its registered agent for service of process, Van Cleave, pursuant to DCRCP Rule 
(8)
 Upon a defendant of any class referred to in
paragraph (1) or (3) of this subdivision of this rule, it is
also sufficient if the summons and complaint are served inthe manner prescribed by any statute.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
4(d)(3).7/ After those efforts proved unsuccessful, MHS filed the 
Motion re Service pursuant to HRS § 666-8. The District Court 
granted the motion and ordered MHS to serve process on Octagon byposting and certified mail, as authorized by DCRCP Rule 4(d)(8) and HRS § 666-8. MHS complied with the Order re Service. On this record, we conclude that service on Octagon was sufficient under DCRCP Rule 4(d)(8) and HRS § 666-8.  
Octagon contends that service by posting violated its 
rights under paragraph 29.5 of the Lease.  However, by its 
terms, Paragraph 29.5 of the Lease did not address service of process. Moreover, the manner of service of process was governed by 
Hawai#i law, not the Lease. Here, as discussed above, MHS 
complied with the Order re Service, which was issued pursuant to applicable Hawai# i law.
9/ 8/
7/ MHS's efforts to serve Octagon through Van Cleave were also made
in accordance with the requirements of HRS § 414-64, which governs service of
process upon a corporation. See HRS § 414-64(a) ("Service of any notice or
process authorized by law issued against any corporation, whether domestic orforeign, by any court . . . may be made in the manner provided by law upon anyregistered agent, officer, or director of the corporation who is found withinthe jurisdiction of the court . . . ."). 
8/ Paragraph 29.5 of the Lease states: 
Notice. Any notice, consent or approval required to
be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and shallbe deemed to have been given (i) upon hand delivery, (ii)one (1) Business Day after being deposited with FederalExpress or another reliable overnight courier service fornext day delivery, (iii) upon facsimile transmission withconfirmation (except that if the date of such transmissionis not a Business Day or if such transmission is made after5:00 p.m. (Hawaii Standard Time) on a Business Day, thensuch notice shall be deemed to be given on the first (1st)Business Day following such transmission), or (iv) three (3)Business Days after being deposited in the United Statesmail, registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, returnreceipt required, addressed to Landlord [MHS] or Tenant[Octagon] at the addresses set forth in the SpecificProvisions. "Business Days" means Mondays to Fridays, otherthan federal and State of Hawaii holidays. Either partyhereto may change its address by giving notice of suchchange in the above manner to the other party. 
The "Specific Provisions" of the Lease list Octagon's address as 1215 SouthKihei Road, Suite O-233, Kihei, HI 96753. 
9/ We note that Octagon's opening brief at page 14 cites an
unpublished memorandum opinion issued by the Hawai #i Supreme Court in 2005.
The citation to this 2005 decision violates 
Hawai #i Rules of Appellate
Procedure ( HRAP) Rule 35(c)(1) (2008) because: the cited case was decided 
continued . . . 
8 . . . continued NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Octagon argues in the alternative that the District 
Court erroneously denied an evidentiary hearing as to whether MHS 
exercised due diligence in serving Octagon. However, Octagon did not establish the need for such a hearing in these circumstances, where MHS complied with the Order re Service, as well as Hawai# i 
law regarding the manner of service. 
On this record, we conclude that the District Court had 
personal jurisdiction over Octagon in the underlying action. Accordingly, the District Court did not err in denying Octagon's First Motion for Reconsideration to the extent Octagon contended that the court lacked personal jurisdiction to enter the Judgment for Possession and the Writ of Possession. Similarly, the District Court did not err in denying Octagon's Second Motion for Reconsideration to the extent Octagon contended that the court lacked personal jurisdiction to enter the Default Judgment. 
(2) Octagon contends that the District Court lacked 
subject matter jurisdiction over this action because MHS had waived its right to a District Court adjudication of any Lease dispute and instead agreed to the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit. MHS argues that the District Court had subject matter jurisdiction under both the Lease and state statute. 
"The existence of jurisdiction is a question of law 
that we review de novo under the right/wrong standard. Questions regarding subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any stage of a cause of action. . . . A judgment rendered by a circuit court without subject matter jurisdiction is void." Ocean Resort 
Villas Vacation Owners Ass'n v. County of Maui, 147 Hawai# i 544, 
552, 465 P.3d 991, 999 (2020) (quoting Amantiad v. Odum, 90 Hawai#i 152, 159, 977 P.2d 160, 167 (1999)). 
"It is well-settled that subject-matter jurisdiction 
cannot be conferred upon a court by agreement, stipulation, or 
prior to July 1, 2008; it does not establish the law of this case; it does not
have res judicata or collateral estoppel effect in this case; and this case isnot a criminal action or proceeding involving "the same respondent."

consent of the parties." Cvitanovich-Dubie v. Dubie, 125 Hawai# i 
128, 141, 254 P.3d 439, 452 (2011) (brackets omitted) (quoting 
Gilmartin v. Abastillas, 10 Haw. App. 283, 292, 869 P.2d 1346, 1351 (1994)). Rather, HRS § 666-6 (2016) provides that "[i]n the case of summary possession proceedings, the person entitled to the possession of the premises shall bring and prosecute the person's action in the district court of the circuit wherein the lands and premises in question are situated." The Hawai# i 
Supreme Court has also made clear that so long as no issue as to title is properly raised, jurisdiction over summary possession actions lies in the district courts. See, e.g., Kimball v. 
Lincoln, 72 Haw. 117, 125, 809 P.2d 1130, 1134 (1991) ("Jurisdiction over summary possession actions lies in the district court, not the circuit court. HRS § 666–6."); Deutsche Bank Nat. Trust Co. v. Peelua, 126 Hawai# i 32, 34 n.8, 265 P.3d 
1128, 1130 n.8 (2011). 
Here, the Complaint initiated a summary possession 
proceeding. The Complaint alleged, among other things: "[MHS] is the landlord or the agent for the landlord of the property"; "[t]he premises is located in this division of this Court"; "[a] copy of the written rental agreement for the premises . . . is attached"; and "[Octagon] has broken the rental agreement" due to unpaid rent and other fees. The Complaint sought in part "[a] Judgment giving [MHS] possession of the premises." 
On this record, we conclude that the District Court had 
subject matter jurisdiction over this summary possession action. Accordingly, the District Court did not err in denying Octagon's First Motion for Reconsideration to the extent Octagon contended that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enter the Judgment for Possession and the Writ of Possession. Similarly, the District Court did not err in denying Octagon's Second Motion for Reconsideration to the extent Octagon contended that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enter the Default Judgment. 
(3) Octagon contends that the District Court lacked an 
evidentiary basis for entering judgment, because a force majeure 
10   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
clause in the Lease  constituted a defense to its enforcement 
for any payment default by Octagon on or after October 1, 2017. 
Alternatively, Octagon contends that the District Court erroneously denied an evidentiary hearing regarding this alleged defense. MHS argues that the force majeure  clause did not apply 
under the circumstances, where Octagon "made its own choice to use the gambling equipment . . . [that] led to scrutiny from the local authorities and ultimate shutdown of the business." 10/
Octagon first raised its purported force majeure 
defense in the First Motion for Reconsideration and raised the same issue again in the Second Motion for Reconsideration. The entirety of Octagon's argument in the First Motion for Reconsideration was as follows: 
3. There Was No Default. 
The Lease Agreement of the parties specifically
provides that in "Force Majeure" circumstances beyond the
control of the lessee as happened here, Declaration of VanCleave, Paragraphs 4, 5, and 6, Exhibit 1, Paragraph 29.4,the obligation to pay rent is abated during the period ofdelay. 
The Second Motion for Reconsideration repeated the same argument 
verbatim, under the heading: "3. There Was No Default by
Defendant Octagon." Both motions relied on a declaration signed 
by Van Cleave, which stated in relevant part that "the local
police, without notice, raided my shop and seized all of my arcade and entertainment equipment, . . claiming that I was running a gambling house, even though that was not the case  
10/ Paragraph 29.4 of the Lease stated: 
Force Majeure. If either party shall be delayed or
hindered or prevented from the performance of any act
required under this Lease by reason of strikes, lockouts,labor troubles, inability to procure materials, severeweather, fire, restrictive laws or regulations, riots,insurrections, war or other reason of a like nature not atthe fault of such party, then performance of such act shallbe excused for the period of the delay and the period forthe performance of such act shall be so extended; providedhowever, that this provision shall not operate to excuse[Octagon] from the payment of rent or any other paymentsrequired hereunder after 60 day grace period after theperiod of delay. If there is no agreement after this graceperiod on payments due than [sic] [MHS] has the option toterminate the lease. 
11  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
. . . ." Van Cleave further stated that he and his attorney had 
notified MHS "that due to the above described events beyond my corporation's control, Defendant Octagon was invoking the Force Majeure . . . condition subsequent in the Lease Agreement 
. . . ." 
We conclude that Octagon's First and Second Motions for 
Reconsideration did not meet the applicable requirements for setting aside a default judgment. Octagon was required to meet the three-prong test applicable to motions to set aside default judgments under HRCP Rule 60(b), which requires a showing that "(1) the nondefaulting party will not be prejudiced by the reopening, (2) that the defaulting party has a meritorious defense, and (3) that the default was not the result of inexcusable neglect or a wilful act." Chen, 146 Hawai# i at 173, 
457 P.3d at 812 (quoting BDM, Inc. v. Sageco, Inc., 57 Haw. 73, 76, 549 P.2d 1147, 1150 (1976));
11/ see M Pocket Corp. v. Shanghai 
Shanghai, LLC, CAAP-16-0000070, 2018 WL 6629650, *5 (Haw. App. Dec. 19, 2018) (SDO) (applying the same three-prong test to a DCRCP Rule 60(b) motion to set aside a judgment for possession). In addition, the burden was on Octagon to establish that each prong had been satisfied. See Chen, 146 Hawai# i at 174, 457 P.3d 
at 813 (citing In re RGB, 123 Hawai# i 1, 17, 229 P.3d 1066, 1082 
(2010)). If Octagon failed to meet any one prong of the test, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to set aside the judgments at issue. See Citicorp Mortg., Inc., 94 
Hawai#i
 at 439, 16 P.3d at 844. 
Here, Octagon made no argument below, and makes none on 
appeal, regarding the first and third prongs of the applicable test, i.e., that MHS would not have been prejudiced had the Judgment for Possession and the Default Judgment been set aside, 
11/ In Chen, the Hawai #i Supreme Court held, prospectively, that
motions to set aside entry of default are governed only by the "good cause"
standard explicitly stated in HRCP Rule 55(c), and need not satisfy thethree-prong test enunciated in BDM, 57 Haw. at 76, 549 P.2d at 1150. See 
Chen, 146 Hawai #i at 160, 457 P.3d at 799. Here, Octagon did not invoke Rule
55(c) in its First and Second Motions for Reconsideration. 
Even if it had,
the holding in Chen
 "applies only to decisions on motions to set aside entry
of default under HRCP Rule 55(c) after the date of this opinion[,]" which wasissued on January 30, 2020. Id. at 177, 457 P.3d at 816. The orders and 
judgments at issue in this case were entered well before that date. 
12   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
and Octagon's default was not the result of inexcusable neglect 
or a wilful act.12/ Without such findings, Octagon was not 
entitled to set aside the Judgment of Possession and the Default Judgment. See M Pocket Corp., 2018 WL 6629650, at *5 (citing 
Citicorp Mortg., 94 Hawai# i at 439, 16 P.3d at 844); see also 
HRAP Rule 28(b)(7) (points not argued may be deemed waived). 
Even with respect to the second prong, Octagon 
presented no argument to the District court as to why the police "raid" described in Van Cleave's declaration qualified as a force majeure under Paragraph 29.4 of the Lease so as to excuse Octagon's payment obligations under the Lease. In short, Octagon did not provide a sufficient legal basis for the District Court to conclude that Octagon had a meritorious defense to the Complaint, and it did not establish the need for an evidentiary hearing in these circumstances. 
Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court did 
not abuse its discretion in denying the First and Second Motions for Reconsideration and in refusing to set aside the Judgment for Possession and the Default Judgment based on Octagon's alleged force majeure defense. 
(4) Octagon contends that the District Court "lacked 
the ability to enter a six-figure default judgment ex parte, without a proof hearing to determine the actual amount of damages[,] if any." Octagon also cites several cases for the proposition that due process requires notice and an opportunity to be heard, and concludes that notice and hearing were not provided here, where "Octagon was not properly served with the summons and complaint to begin with." MHS contends that the District Court properly entered the Default Judgment even without a proof hearing because Octagon had failed to appear to defend and raise any defenses, and was already in default. 
DCRCP Rule 55 provides, in relevant parts: 
12/ For example, there is no apparent dispute that Van Cleave was
Octagon's registered agent for service of process at the 83 Kainehe Place
Address. However, Octagon failed to provide any explanation for why repeatedattempts to serve Van Cleave at that address were unsuccessful, or why postingat that address was not an effective means of service.

(Emphases added.) DCRCP Rule 5(a) thus provides two exceptions 
to the general rule requiring service upon each of the parties: for a motion that may be heard ex parte, and upon a party in default for failure to appear. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
DEFAULT. 
(a) Entry.  When a party against whom a judgment for
affirmative relief is sought has failed to plead or
otherwise defend as provided by these rules, and the fact ismade to appear by affidavit or otherwise, the clerk shallenter that party's default. 
(b) Judgment.  Judgment by default may be entered as
follows: 
. . . . 
(2)
 BY THE COURT. In all other cases the party
entitled to a judgment by default shall apply to the courttherefor. If, in order to enable the court to enterjudgment or to carry it into effect, it is necessary to takean account or to determine the amount of damages or toestablish the truth of any averment by evidence or to makean investigation of any other matter, the court may conductsuch hearings as it deems necessary and proper. 
(Emphases added.) 
DCRCP Rule 5 provides, in relevant part:
 SERVICE AND FILINGS OF PLEADINGS AND OTHER PAPERS. 
(a) Service: When required.  Except as otherwise
provided in these rules, every order required by its termsto be served, every pleading subsequent to the originalcomplaint unless the court otherwise orders because ofnumerous defendants, every written motion other than onewhich may be heard ex parte, and every written notice,appearance, demand, brief or memorandum of law, offer ofjudgment, bill of costs, designation of record on appeal,and similar paper shall be served upon each of the parties,but no service need be made on parties in default forfailure to appear, except that pleadings asserting new oradditional claims for relief against them shall be servedupon them in the manner provided for service of summons inRule 4. 
Here, as previously discussed, Octagon was served per 
the Order re Service and failed to appear and answer on 
December 11, 2017. The District Court entered default against Octagon and directed MHS to file an ex parte motion for damages. Under DCRCP Rule 55(a), the entry of default was proper when Octagon failed to appear, plead, or otherwise defend. For the reasons set forth in Section (1), we reject Octagon's argument that it was not properly served.

On or about January 24, 2018, MHS submitted its Motion 
for Default Judgment to the District Court. The motion detailed 
MHS's requested judgment in the amount of $120,309.51, comprising: a principal amount (due under the Lease), attorney's fees, filing fee, service fee, and other costs. The motion was supported by a continuation sheet that: (1) provided the factual background of the case, including Octagon's alleged breach of the Lease and the addendum to the Lease; and (2) itemized the amounts that went into determining the principal amount, including, inter alia, rent, shared marketing expenses, taxes, utilities, and late fees, which were offset in-part by a credit to Octagon for payment already made by Octagon. As supporting exhibits, the Motion for Default Judgment included a copy of the Lease and the addendum to the Lease, an accounting ledger, and a declaration regarding attorneys' fees and costs. The Motion for Default Judgment did not assert any new or additional claims for relief against Octagon. Thus, under DCRCP Rule 5(a), the Motion for Default Judgment did not require service, because it was a motion that could be heard ex parte,
13/ and was brought against a party 
that was in default for failure to appear, and did not assert any new or additional claims for relief against the defaulted party. 
Given the record and the circumstances of this case, we 
conclude there was no due process violation. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Second Motion for Reconsideration to the extent Octagon contended that the Default Judgment was improperly entered without a proof hearing. 
(5) Octagon contends that the District Court "lacked 
the ability to enter a six-figure default judgment [that] 
13/ Under DCRCP Rule 55(b)(2), the District Court had authority to
direct the filing of an ex parte motion to determine damages. Compare DCRCP
Rule 55(b)(2) ("If, in order to enable the court to enter judgment or to carry
it into effect, it is necessary to take an account or to determine the amountof damages . . ., the court may conduct such hearings as it deems necessaryand proper.") with HRCP Rule 55(b)(2) ("If a party against whom judgment bydefault is sought has appeared in the action, the party . . . shall be servedwith written notice of the application for judgment at least 3 days prior tothe hearing on such application. If, in order to enable the court to enterjudgment or to carry it into effect, it is necessary to take an account or todetermine the amount of damages . . ., the court may conduct such hearings asit deems necessary and proper and shall accord a right of trial by jury to theparties when and as required by any statute.").

exceeded the amount requested in [the Complaint]." Octagon 
contrasts the final Default Judgment amount of $120,309.51 with the amount of "$58,171.35" specified as "[u]npaid rent" in the Complaint. 
DCRCP Rule 54(c) provides, in pertinent part: 
JUDGMENTS; COSTS. 
. . . . 
(c)
 Demand for judgment. A judgment by default shall
not be different in kind from or exceed in amount that 
prayed for in the demand for judgment. 
See In re Genesys Data Techs., Inc., 95 Hawai# i 33, 38, 18 P.3d 
895, 900 (2001) (construing analogous HRCP Rule 54(c)). 
Here, the Complaint specified "[u]npaid rent 
$58,171.35" and specifically prayed for that amount in the demand 
for judgment. However, the Complaint also identified "[o]ther [l]egal fees, cost of collection, [and] late fees" in connection with the alleged breach of the Lease. The Complaint's demand for judgment sought, among other things: 
C. Judgment against [Octagon] for $58,171.35. 
In addition, the Court may award additional rent and
other charges owed under the rental agreement,damages, court costs, interest, and reasonableattorney's fees. 
Thus, the Complaint's demand for judgment was not limited to 
$58,171.35. 
Consistent with this demand, MHS's later Motion for 
Default Judgment requested judgment in the amount of $120,309.51, supported by the detail and documentation discussed above in Section (4). All of the itemized amounts specified by MHS related, variously, to the "[l]egal fees, cost of collection, late fees" or "additional rent and other charges owed under the rental agreement, damages, court costs, interest, and reasonable attorney's fees," all prayed for in the Complaint. Thus, the final Default Judgment amount of $120,309.51 did not exceed the amount prayed for in the Complaint. See Henry v. Sneiders, 490 
F.2d 315, 317 n.2 (9th Cir. 1974) (per curiam) (construing Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 54(c) and holding that a 
16  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
default judgment for $235,338.39 did not exceed the amount prayed 
for where the complaint requested "judgment . . . in the sum of $71,243.68 . . . and for [p]laintiff's other damages as are proved at the time of trial, together with interest and costs"); see also Genesys Data, 95 Hawai# i at 42, 18 P.3d at 904 
(regarding HRCP Rule 9(g), "there is no requirement that any specific amount be alleged, and the purposes of both HRCP Rules 9(g) and 54(c) are met where the 'plaintiff states the nature of the injury . . . and sets forth the specific elements of damages for which he seeks judgment' such that the defendant can make a reasonably informed judgment as to whether to actively defend the action" (emphasis omitted) (quoting Melehes v. Wilson, 774 P.2d 573, 579–80 (Wyo. 1989))). 
On this record, we conclude that the $120,309.51 
judgment amount was not "different in kind from" and did not "exceed in amount that prayed for in the demand for judgment." DCRCP Rule 54(c). Accordingly, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Second Motion for Reconsideration to the extent Octagon contended that the Default Judgment exceeded the amount requested in the Complaint. 
(6) Octagon further contends that "all five errors 
above by the State District Court . . . created a series of compounding due process violations, denying Octagon its freedom of contact, its written contractual rights, and its procedural due process rights to notice and a hearing before suffering financial forfeitures." 
Initially, we note that this omnibus argument was not 
raised below and is thus waived on appeal. See State v. 
Gonzalez, 128 Hawai# i 314, 317, 288 P.3d 788, 791 (2012); State 
v. Moses, 102 Hawai# i 449, 456, 77 P.3d 940, 947 (2003). 
Regardless, for the reasons previously discussed, the argument is without merit. 
For the reasons discussed above, we affirm the 
following orders and judgments, entered in the District Court of the Second Circuit, Wailuku Division: (1) the December 18, 2017 Judgment for Possession; (2) the December 18, 2017 Writ of Possession; (3) the January 30, 2018 order granting the Ex Parte
