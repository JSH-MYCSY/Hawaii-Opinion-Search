 the Fifth Circuit's1 October 16, 2018 Second Amended Judgment2 
dismissing all claims as to Defendants/Cross-Claim 
Plaintiffs/Cross-Claim Defendants-Appellees State of Hawaiʻ i 
(State), Kauaʻ i Island Utility Cooperative, and Hawaiian Telecom, 
Inc., and Defendant/Cross-Claim Defendant-Appellee County of 
Kaua‘i. 
  Briefly, while driving during the early morning on 
Kūhiō Highway in Kapa‘ a, Kaua‘i, Bruce S. Perdue drove his car off 
the paved road and shoulder into a utility pole.  He died as a 
result of the injuries he sustained in this single-car accident. 
The Perdue family filed a complaint for wrongful 
death.  By stipulation, all claims and cross-claims were 
dismissed except for claims by the Perdue Family against the 
State. 
The State moved for summary judgment, arguing that the 
decision not to install guardrails around the utility pole was within the "discretionary function exception to the . . . waiver 
of sovereign immunity" (Discretionary Function Exception) of 
 
1  The Honorable Kathleen N.A. Watanabe presided. 
 
2  Though the Perdue family actually appealed from the January 23, 2018 
First Amended Judgment, we entered an order for temporary remand instructing 
the circuit court to enter and supplement the record with a second amended 
judgment resolving all remaining claims, as we determined we lacked appellate 
jurisdiction over the case since the first amended judgment did not resolve 
all claims.  On temporary remand, the circuit court entered the second 
amended judgment.  We therefore construe this appeal as from the circuit 
court's second amended judgment. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 Hawai‘i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 662-15 (2016).  The circuit 
court granted summary judgment, and dismissed the entire case.  
The Perdue Family moved for reconsideration, which was denied, and timely appealed. 
On appeal, the Perdue Family contends the circuit 
court erred in granting the State's motion for summary judgment and taxing costs.

3  The Perdue Family actually raise nine points of error, contending the 
circuit court reversibly erred: 
 
(1) in granting summary judgment on the entire complaint when the 
State, in its motion for summary judgment (MSJ), argued against only one possible theory of liability;  
 
(2) in denying their motion for reconsideration;  
 
(3) by omitting from the order granting the MSJ (MSJ Order), and 
the Second Amended Judgment, a finding that the State was entitled to 
judgment "as a matter of law," and by failing to include a finding in 
the Second Amended Judgment that no genuine issue of material fact existed; 
 
(4) in determining that the "installation" of the utility pole 
without a guardrail was a discretionary act requiring broad policy 
consideration, though each time the pole was repaired or reinstalled 
following a collision was an operational maintenance event;  
 
(5) in disregarding the conflict between the State Tort Liability 
Act, HRS § 662-2 (2016), and Hawaiʻ i Administrative Rules § 19- 127.1-8 
(eff. 1994) , the latter of which directs the placement of guardrails 
and protective barriers next to roadside hazards; 
 (6) in dismissing potential claim(s) that the State acted 
negligently in permitting installation of the utility pole without a 
safety investigation, disregarding its accident history, and allowing 
the utility pole to remain in its location; 
 (7) in dismissing potential claim(s) that the State negligently 
failed to contact the utility companies concerning the hazard created 
by the utility pole or to revoke the permit for its location, given its 
accident history;

 Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve this appeal as discussed below. 
  We review the grant or denial of summary judgment de 
novo.  Ralston v. Yim, 129 Hawaiʻ i 46, 55, 292 P.3d 1276, 1285 
(2013).  "Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, 
depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file, 
together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no 
genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law."  Id. (citation and 
brackets omitted). 
A defendant moving for summary judgment "may satisfy 
his or her initial burden of production by either (1) presenting evidence negating an element of the non
-movant's claim, or 
(2) demonstrating that the [non-movant] will be unable to carry 
his or her burden of proof at trial."  Id. at 60, 292 P.3d at 
 
(. . . continued) 
 
(8) in disregarding Hawaiʻ i Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 56(d) by 
failing to ask the parties whether there were outstanding claims raised 
in the complaint that the MSJ did not cover; and 
 
(9) in taxing costs against the Perdue Family after jurisdiction 
had already transferred to this court upon the filing of the notice of appeal.   
 Because we hold the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment, in 
dismissing the entire complaint, and taxing costs, we need not address the 
remaining points raised.

 1290.  We view the evidence and inferences drawn therefrom in 
the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.  Id. 
at 56, 292 P.3d at 1286. 
Regarding the Discretionary Function Exception of HRS 
§ 662-15, "the State bears the burden to assert and prove the 
application of the discretionary function exception," and its scope must be determined "on a case-by-case basis."  O'Grady v. 
State, 140 Hawai‘ i 36, 53-55, 398 P.3d 625, 642-44 (2017).  
In determining whether a State action falls within the 
discretionary function exception, we consider whether the challenged conduct involves the effectuation of broad public policy as opposed to routine, operational level activity. . . .  The exercise of some discretion on the 
part of a State official is not necessarily indicative that the exception applies[.] 
 
Id. at 54, 398 P.3d at 643 (cleaned up). 
The State here appears to rely on the need "to 
purchase additional right-of-way to accommodate the relocation 
of the line of utility poles" as the basis for falling within the Discretionary Function Exception.  But, the State then 
acknowledges that it would not be "required to purchase 
additional right-of-way if, instead, the utilities purchase easements on the adjacent private parcels."  With this, we cannot say that the State proved erecting a guardrail in this case "involve[d] the effectuation of broad public policy" as a matter of law.  See Breed v. Shaner, 57 Haw. 656, 667, 562 P.2d 
436, 443 (1977) ("In this situation further facts must be NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 adduced on the record to show that the decision to include a 
curve or other design feature involved the evaluation of broad policy factors before the court can decide that the 
discretionary function exception applies"); O'Grady, 140 Hawai‘ i 
at 54, 398 P.3d at 643. 
Moreover, Hawai‘ i courts have determined that 
decisions concerning the repair of an existing defective 
guardrail, implementation of a routine rockfall mitigation system, the location of a road sign, and when to repaint lane markings are operational level activities; but decisions to construct a prison or whether to rebuild the collapsed Moanalua 
Stream Bridge are discretionary functions.
4  Erecting a guardrail 
appears closer to repairing a guardrail, implementing a rockfall 
mitigation system, and determining the location of road signs rather than constructing a prison or rebuilding a collapsed bridge.  And that funding for a government project originates from a policy-level allocation of resources does not necessarily make that particular project a policy-level decision.  Cf. 
Julius Rothschild & Co. v. State, 66 Haw. 76, 80, 655 P.2d 877, 
 
4  See, e.g., O'Grady, 140 Hawai‘ i 36, 398 P.3d 625 (rockfall 
mitigation); Taylor- Rice v. State, 91 Hawai‘ i 60, 979 P.2d 1086 (1999) 
(defective guardrail); Rogers v. State, 51 Haw. 293, 459 P.2d 378 (1969) 
(road sign location); Julius Rothschild & Co. v. State, 66 Haw. 76, 655 P.2d 
877 (1982) (rebuilding collapsed bridge); Breed, 57 Haw. at 667, 562 P.2d at 
443 (noting as an example a decision not to construct a prison "require[s] 
evaluation of broad policy factors"). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 881 (1982) (noting that the legislature must decide whether to 
fund reconstruction of the Moanalua Stream Bridge). 
Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to 
the Perdue Family, the State failed to establish that the Discretionary Function Exception applies to erecting a guardrail 
in this case as a matter of law.  See generally, Ralston, 129 
Hawaiʻi at 56, 292 P.3d at 1286; O'Grady, 140 Hawai‘ i at 54, 398 
P.3d at 643. 
  Even if the State met its burden of showing that 
erecting guardrails here fell under the Discretionary Function Exception as a matter of law, the State failed to show that the entire complaint should have been dismissed. 
"[M]ultiple claims present the possibility of multiple 
recoveries which are not mutually exclusive," however "single claims may present multiple legal theories of liability, but seek only one recovery which is mutually exclusive."  Elliot 
Megdal & Assocs. v. Daio USA Corp., 87 Hawaiʻ i 129, 133, 952 P.2d 
886, 890 (App. 1998) (emphasis added and citation omitted).  "[W]here the complaint allege[s] more than one ground for 
imposing liability on the defendant for the plaintiff's injury, 
and the defendant's summary judgment motion attacked only one ground, summary judgment on the entire claim [i]s unwarranted."  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 Kukui Nuts of Hawaii Inc. v. R. Baird & Co., 7 Haw. App. 598, 
610, 789 P.2d 501, 510 (1990).  Moreover, 
where the defendant is the moving party, there is no 
genuine issue as to any material fact and the defendant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law if, upon viewing 
the record in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, it 
is clear that the plaintiff would not be entitled to 
recover under any discernable theory. 
 
Neilsen v. Am. Honda Motor Co., 92 Hawaiʻ i 180, 189, 989 P.2d 
264, 273 (App. 1999) (emphases added, citation and brackets 
omitted).  "Under Hawaiʻ i's notice pleading approach, it is no 
longer necessary to plead legal theories with precision"; 
"[p]leadings must be construed liberally . . . as to do 
substantial justice."  Tokuhisa v. Cutter Mgmt. Co., 122 Hawaiʻ i 
181, 192, 223 P.3d 246, 257 (App. 2009) (cleaned up).  
      Here, The State's motion for summary judgment focused 
on guardrails.  The State argued this case "does not involve a 
mere maintenance, repair or upgrade of a guardrail"; rather, "this case would necessitate an engineering study to determine whether or not guardrails are a reasonable engineering option."  The State requested the circuit court "recognize that the decision-making involved in making changes along [Kūhiō] Highway in the vicinity of the subject accident would require the 
exercise of the State's discretionary function."  Thus, the 
State concluded it was "immune from liability for its act and/or NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
 
 
9 
 omissions in the exercise of that discretion" and was entitled 
to summary judgment. 
But, the complaint alleged, inter alia, that the 
utility pole, "together with the real property on which it was situate[d], constituted an unreasonable risk of harm" and was 
"unreasonably dangerous" to drivers, and that the collective 
defendants "failed to adequately protect motorists" from the "pole and/or [the] unreasonably dangerous condition/risk of harm created by it."  Construed liberally, these allegations do not suggest the failure to install a guardrail is the only discernable theory of liability on which the Perdue Family could 
prevail.  See generally, Tokuhisa, 122 Hawaiʻ i at 192, 223 P.3d 
at 257; Neilsen, 92 Hawaiʻ i at 189, 989 P.2d at 273.   
Viewing the evidence presented in the light most 
favorable to the Perdue Family, the State failed to meet its 
burden of showing that the entire complaint should have been dismissed as a matter of law based on guardrails.  See 
generally, Ralston, 129 Hawaiʻ i at 56, 60, 292 P.3d at 1286, 
1290.   
Thus, the circuit court erred in granting summary 
judgment and erred in dismissing the entire case.  As the State is no longer the prevailing party, the Perdue Family should not 
be taxed costs.  Hawai‘ i Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 54(d)(1). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
