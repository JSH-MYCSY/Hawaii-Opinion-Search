IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
MASTERS PROPERTIES, LLC, Plaintiff-Appellee, 
v.
DAVIS DESIGN CENTER CORPORATION; GARY M. DAVIS,
Defendants/Cross-Claimants/
Cross-Claim Defendants-Appellants,
and
MARIA C. DAVIS, also known as MARIA CONNIE DAVIS,
Defendant/Cross-Claim Defendant/Cross-Claimant-Appellee
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 1RC17-1-5203)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, and Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
Upon review of (1) Plaintiff-Appellee Masters
Properties, LLC's (Masters Properties) March 8, 2018 motion to
dismiss appellate court case number CAAP-18-0000123 for lack of
appellate jurisdiction, (2) Defendants/Cross-Claimants/Cross-
Claim Defendants-Appellants Davis Design Center Corporation and
Gary M. Davis's (the Appellants) March 15, 2018 memorandum in
opposition to Masters Properties' March 8, 2018 motion, and (3)
the record, it appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction over
the Appellants' appeal from the Honorable Hilary Benson Gangnes's
February 2, 2018 interlocutory order denying the Appellants'
February 2, 2018 motion for clarification or reconsideration of a
January 17, 2018 interlocutory order denying the Appellants'
demand for a jury trial in district court civil case number
1RC17-1-5203.  The February 2, 2018 interlocutory order is not anNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
appealable final order that resolves all the remaining claims in
this case, as Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (2016)
requires for an appeal from a civil district court case.  Nor
does the order fall under any one of the three recognized
exceptions to the final judgment rule.  
Under HRS § 641-1(a),
appeals are allowed in civil matters from all final
judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit and district
courts.  In district court cases, a judgment includes any
order from which an appeal lies.  See District Court Rules
of Civil Procedure (DCRCP) Rule 54(a) (1996).  A final order
means an order ending the proceeding, leaving nothing
further to be accomplished. . . .  When a written judgment,
order, or decree ends the litigation by fully deciding all
rights and liabilities of all parties, leaving nothing
further to be adjudicated, the judgment, order, or decree is
final and appealable.
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai# i 425, 426, 984 P.2d 1251,
1252 (1999) (citations, internal quotation marks, and footnote
omitted; emphases added).  The Supreme Court of Hawaii #
has promulgated separate rules governing civil procedure in
the district courts . . . .  DCRCP Rule 58 (1996), in
contrast to HRCP Rule 58, does not by its plain language
require that judgment be set forth on a "separate document." 
Thus, the requirements set forth in Jenkins [v. Cades
Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawaii 115, 869 P.2d 1334
(1994)], are not applicable to district court cases. 
Consequently, an order that fully disposes of an action in
the district court may be final and appealable without the
entry of judgment on a separate document, as long as the
appealed order ends the litigation by fully deciding the
rights and liabilities of all parties and leaves nothing
further to be adjudicated.
Id. at 427, 984 P.2d at 1253 (footnote and citation omitted). At
the time when the Appellants filed their March 2, 2018 notice of
appeal, the district court had resolved only one of the multiple
substantive claims in this case by way of a September 5, 2017
judgment for possession in favor of Masters Properties1 as to
Masters Properties' first amended complaint for breach of lease. 
The district court has not yet adjudicated the issue of whether
Masters Properties is entitled to an award of money damages on
its cause of action for breach of lease, or the district court
1If an aggrieved party does not assert an "immediate appeal of the
judgment for possession under the Forgay doctrine[,]" the aggrieved party must
"await final resolution of all claims in the case before challenging the
judgment for possession."  Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai #i 18, 21, 889 P.2d 702,
705 (1995).

issues raised by Appellants' cross-claim for indemnification and
contribution against Defendant/Cross-Claim Defendant/Cross-
Claimant-Appellee Maria C. Davis.  The district court has not yet
entered a final order or final judgment that ends the litigation
by fully deciding the rights and liabilities of all parties as to
the remaining claims and that leaves nothing further to be
adjudicated, as HRS § 641-1(a) requires for an appeal under the
holding in Casumpang .
Although exceptions to the final judgment requirement
exist under the doctrine in Forgay v. Conrad , 47 U.S. 201 (1848)
(the Forgay doctrine), the collateral order doctrine, and HRS
§ 641-1(b) (2016), the February 2, 2018 interlocutory order does
not satisfy all of the requirements for this court to assume
appellate jurisdiction over this appeal under the Forgay
doctrine, the collateral order doctrine, or HRS § 641-1(b).  See
Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai #i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995)
(regarding the two requirements for appealability under the
Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright , 88
Hawai#i 319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding the three
requirements for the collateral order doctrine); HRS § 641-1(b)
(regarding the requirements for an appeal from an interlocutory
order); State v. Nilsawit , 139 Hawai #i 86, 91, 384 P.3d 862, 867
(2016) ("HRS § 641-1(b) does not allow interlocutory appeals of
civil matters originating from the district court.").  We note
that, even if there was authority holding that a district court's
denial of a party's demand for a jury trial is appealable under
the collateral order doctrine, the district court denied the
Appellants' demand for a jury trial by way of a January 17, 2018
interlocutory order, Appellant's did not file their motion for
clarification or reconsideration within the ten (10) days
thereafter, and the Appellant's did not file their March 2, 2018
notice of appeal within thirty days after entry of the
January 17, 2018 interlocutory order in violation of Rule 4(a)(1)
of the Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Masters
Properties' March 8, 2018 motion to dismiss this appeal is
granted, and appellate court case number CAAP-18-0000123 is
