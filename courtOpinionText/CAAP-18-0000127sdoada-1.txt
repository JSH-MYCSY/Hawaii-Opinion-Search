v.
CRYSTAL MAE MARINAS, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CASE NO. 1DTA-17-02276)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Hiraoka, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Crystal Mae Marinas ( Marinas) was
convicted of Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an
Intoxicant ( OVUII) in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
ยง 291E-61(a)(1) (Supp. 2018).   She appeals from the Notice of
Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment ( Judgment)
entered on January 12, 2018, and the Amended Notice of Entry of
Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment ( Amended Judgment )
entered by the District Court of the First Circuit, Wai #anae
Division ( District Court ) on October 4, 2018.  On appeal, Marinas
claims there was insufficient evidence to convict her of OVUII. 
For the reasons explained below, we affirm the Judgment and
Amended Judgment.1
1HRS ยง 291E-61 provides, in relevant part:
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if the person
operates or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle:
(1)While under the influence of alcohol in an
amount sufficient to impair the person's normal
mental faculties or ability to care for the
person and guard against casualty[.]NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
On June 26, 2017, Marinas was charged by complaint with
OVUII.  The charge arose from an incident that allegedly occurred
on May 28, 2017.  Marinas pleaded not guilty.  A jury-waived
trial was conducted on January 12, 2018.   The State's only
witness was Honolulu Police Department ( HPD) Officer Ryan
Espiritu ( Officer Espiritu ).  Officer Espiritu testified that
sometime after midnight on May 28, 2017, he was on duty driving a
marked HPD vehicle westbound on the H-1 freeway.  He observed
Marinas driving a sedan about four car lengths ahead.  They were
the only vehicles on the road.  Marinas was driving partially in
the right lane, straddling the solid white line that separates
the traffic lane from the unimproved shoulder.  Both passenger-
side tires of Marinas' car were on the shoulder.  Officer
Espiritu watched her driving for about four seconds.  She
returned to the travel lane but drifted over the solid white line
two more times within a half-mile.  After the third time, Officer
Espiritu pulled Marinas over.  She was the only person in her
vehicle, with a dog in the back seat.  An odor of alcohol came
from her vehicle, and became more pronounced when she spoke.  She
said she was coming from a barbecue.  Officer Espiritu testified
that Marinas' face was flushed.  Her eyes were red, watery, and
glassy.  Officer Espiritu arrested her for OVUII.2
Marinas did not testify.  The District Court ruled:
I'm convinced that reasonable -- beyond a reasonable
doubt that -- that you were impaired.  Based on this
evidence and based on the -- the character of the driving, I
-- I'm finding you guilty in this case.
This appeal followed.
In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to
support the conviction the appellate court must take that
view of the evidence with inferences reasonably and
justifiably to be drawn therefrom most favorable to the
Government, without weighing the evidence or determining the
credibility of the witnesses.  The test on appeal is not
whether guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt, but
whether there was substantial evidence to support the
conclusion of the trier of fact.
