NO. CAAP-18-0000128
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI #I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
KAPANA B. THRONAS-KAHOONEI, Defendant-Appellant.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
(CASE NO. 5DCW-17-0001185)
ORDER
DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise, and Reifurth, JJ.)
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
appellate jurisdiction over Defendant-Appellant Kapana B.
Thronas-Kahoonei's (Thronas-Kahoonei), pro se, appeal in
appellate court case number CAAP-18-0000128, apparently from two
interlocutory orders that the District Court of the Fifth Circuit
(District Court) entered on January 14 and March 6, 2018,
relating to the future trial on Plaintiff-Appellee State of
Hawaii's (the State) charge against Thronas-Kahoonei for failing
to appear in answer to a citation in violation of Hawaii Revised
Statutes (HRS) ยง 803-6(e) (2014) in district court criminal case
number 5DCW-17-0001185."The right to an appeal is strictly statutory."  State
v. Ontiveros, 82 Hawai# i 446, 449, 923 P.2d 388, 391 (1996)
(citation omitted).  The Hawai #i Intermediate Court of Appeals
has jurisdiction "[t]o hear and determine appeals from any court
or agency when appeals are allowed by law[.]"  HRS ยง 602-57(1)
(2016).  HRS ยง 641-12(a) (2016) is the statute providing that
"[a]ppeals upon the record shall be allowed from all final
decisions and final judgments of district courts in all criminal
matters."  Consequently, "in order to appeal a criminal matter in
the district court, the appealing party must appeal from a
written judgment or order that has been filed with the clerk of
the court pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(b)(3)."  State v. Bohannon , 102
Hawai#i 228, 236, 74 P.3d 980, 988 (2003);  see also  Rule 32(c)(2)
of the Hawai# i Rules of Penal Procedure.  And even when the
district court enters a judgment of conviction, "[j]udgments of
conviction are not final unless they include the final
adjudication and the final sentence."  State v. Kilborn , 109
Hawai#i 435, 442, 127 P.3d 95, 102 (App. 2005) (dismissing an
appeal from a district court judgment of conviction that did not
finally determine the entire sentence).  
In the instant case, the District Court has not yet
held a bench trial in District Court criminal case number 
5DCW-17-0001185 pending the resolution of this appeal.  Absent an
appealable final judgment, however, the appealed interlocutory
orders are not eligible for appellate review, and Thronas-
Kahoonei's appeal is premature.
For the purpose of assisting the District Court in
future similar circumstances, we note that Thronas-Kahoonei's
jurisdictionally defective appeal from the interlocutory orders
did not divest the District Court of jurisdiction.  "Generally,
the filing of a notice of appeal divests the trial court of
jurisdiction over the appealed case."  TSA International Limited
v. Shimizu Corporation, 92 Hawai# i 243, 265, 990 P.2d 713, 735
(1999) (citations omitted).  "The general rule, however, assumes 
2that the notice of appeal is valid under the applicable statutory
provisions and procedural rules.  Where the notice of appeal is
jurisdictionally defective, filing the notice does not transfer
jurisdiction from the trial court to the appellate court." 
Ontiveros, 82 Hawai #i at 449, 923 P.2d at 391 (citations omitted;
emphasis added).
In light of our lack of appellate jurisdiction, IT IS
HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number CAAP-18-0000128
is dismissed.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, June 26, 2018.
