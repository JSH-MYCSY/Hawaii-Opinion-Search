IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
CITIMORTGAGE, INC., Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
BESSIE LEE FREITAS PREGANA and BRIAN JOSEPH PREGANA, SR.,
Defendants-Appellants
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 13-1-000755)
 
ORDER GRANTING THE JUNE 19, 2018 MOTION TO
DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) Plaintiff-Appellee Citimortgage, 
Inc.'s (Citimortgage) June 19, 2018 motion to dismiss appellate 
court case number CAAP-18-0000130 for lack of appellate jurisdiction, (2) the July 2, 2018 memorandum by Defendants-Appellants Bessie Lee Freitas Pregana and Brian Joseph Pregana, Sr. (the Pregana Appellants), pro se, in opposition to Citimortgage's June 19, 2018 motion, and (3) the record, it appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction over the Pregana Appellants' appeal as to the Honorable Bert I. Ayabe's February 4, 2015 judgment on a decree of foreclosure in Civil No. 13-1-0755-03, because the Pregana Appellants' March 6, 2018 notice of appeal is untimely under Rule 4(a)(1) of the Hawai' i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP). It further appears that we NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
lack appellate jurisdiction as to the Pregana Appellants' appeal
 
from the Honorable Jeannette Holmes Castagnetti's April 17, 2018
 order granting Citimortgage's February 5, 2018 motion to
 terminate a prior stay order in this case, because the April 17,
 2018 order does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable
 final order under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 667-51(a)
 (2016) or HRS § 641-1(a) (2016).
 
The circuit court's February 4, 2015 judgment on the 
decree of foreclosure was immediately appealable under HRS § 667-51(a)(1). "When a civil appeal is permitted by law, the notice of appeal shall be filed within 30 days after entry of the judgment or appealable order." HRAP Rule 4(a)(1). The Pregana Appellants did not file their March 6, 2018 notice of appeal within thirty days after entry of the February 4, 2015 judgment, as HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) required for a timely appeal. Although the record on appeal contains a notice of entry of judgment indicating that the circuit court clerk mailed a copy of the February 4, 2015 judgment to the Pregana Appellants on February 4, 2015, the Pregana Appellants assert in their notice of appeal that they did not learn about the entry of the February 4, 2015 judgment until March 6, 2018. Even assuming, arguendo, that the Pregana Appellants' assertion is correct, Rule 77(d) of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) 
provides that the "[l]ack of notice of the entry by the clerk or failure to make such service, does not affect the time to appeal or relieve or authorize the court to relieve a party for failure to appeal within the time allowed, except as permitted in Rule 4(a) of the Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure." As the 
Supreme Court of Hawai' i has explained: 
Although HRCP Rule 77(d) specifically refers to HRAP
Rule 4(a) as providing the only relief for a party's failure
to timely file a notice of appeal, nothing in Rule 77(d)
suggests that the failure of the clerk to timely notify the
parties of the entry of judgment could excuse a party's
neglect. "A party has an independent duty to keep informed
and mere failure of the clerk to notify the parties that
judgment has been entered does not provide grounds for
excusable neglect or warrant an extension of time." Alaska
Limestone Corp. v. Hodel, 799 F.2d 1409, 1412 (9th Cir.1986)
(citations omitted). This is especially so where, as here,
"[appellants] presented no reason for their failure, for
example, to send a messenger to court to look up the
relevant date, and we see no 'forces beyond their
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
control,'-at least on this record-that prevented them from
taking this eminently reasonable step." Virella-Nieves, 53
F.3d at 453.
 
Enos v. Pacific Transfer & Warehouse, Inc., 80 Hawai' i 345, 353, 
910 P.2d 116, 124 (1996); see also Ek v. Boggs, 102 Hawai' i 289, 
299-300, 75 P.3d 1180, 1190-91 (2003). 
The failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a
 
civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot
 
waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise
 of judicial discretion. Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727
 
P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or
 justice is authorized to change the jurisdictional requirements
 contained in Rule 4 of these rules."); HRAP Rule 26(e) ("The
 reviewing court for good cause shown may relieve a party from a
 default occasioned by any failure to comply with these rules,
 except the failure to give timely notice of appeal."). 
Therefore, we lack appellate jurisdiction over the Pregana
 Appellants' untimely appeal from the February 4, 2015 judgment.
 
Although the Pregana Appellants' March 6, 2018 notice 
of appeal is timely under HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) as to the April 17, 2018 order granting Citimortgage's February 5, 2018 motion to terminate the stay, it appears that the April 17, 2018 order is not independently appealable under either HRS § 667-51(a) (2016) or HRS § 641-1(a). The circumstances of the instant case do not involve a purely post-judgment proceeding, because a foreclosure case is, by its nature, a bifurcated proceeding that does not terminate with the judgment on the decree of foreclosure, but, instead, proceeds forward to the second part of the foreclosure case. The Supreme Court of Hawai' i 
has previously noted that foreclosure cases are bifurcated
into two separately appealable parts: (1) the decree of
foreclosure and the order of sale, if the order of sale is
incorporated within the decree; and (2) all other orders
. . . . A litigant who wishes to challenge a decree of
foreclosure and order of sale may – and, indeed, must – do
so within the thirty day period following entry of the
decree or will lose the right to appeal that portion of the
foreclosure proceeding.

Beneficial Hawai' i, Inc. v. Casey, 98 Hawai' i 159, 165, 45 P.3d 
359, 365 (2002) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted; 
emphasis added). 
The rationale for permitting (and requiring) an appeal of a
foreclosure decree and its accompanying orders, even though
there may be additional proceedings remaining in the circuit
court, is that a foreclosure decree falls within that small
class of orders which finally determine claims of right
separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the
action, too important to be denied review and too
independent of the cause itself to require that appellate
consideration be deferred until the whole case is
 adjudicated.
 
Id. (citations and internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis
 
added). Now that the April 17, 2018 order has terminated the
 stay, the circuit court can proceed with the second part of this
 bifurcated foreclosure proceeding. 
While the stay was pending in the instant case, the
 
parties were waiting for the second part of this bifurcated
 foreclosure case to begin, namely the determination whether the
 circuit court should confirm the sale of the foreclosed property. 
In that sense, the April 17, 2018 order granting Citimortgage's
 February 5, 2018 motion to terminate the stay is an interlocutory
 order and does not qualify as an independently appealable order
 under HRS § 667-51(a).
 
The April 17, 2018 order granting Citimortgage's
 
February 5, 2018 motion to terminate the stay did not finally
 determine any proceeding in this foreclosure case, but, instead,
 it actually recommenced the pending proceeding for determining
 whether the circuit court should confirm the sale of the
 foreclosed property. Therefore, the Pregana Appellants' appeal
 is premature as to the April 17, 2018 order, and we lack
 appellate jurisdiction.
