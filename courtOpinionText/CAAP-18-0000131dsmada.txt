IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
LANCE KAMUELA GOMES, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 5DCC-17-0000454)
 
ORDER
 
DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
appellate jurisdiction over the appeal of Defendant-Appellant
 
Lance Kamuela Gomes (Gomes), pro se, in appellate court case
 
number CAAP-18-0000131. It appears that Gomes seeks review of
 
the Honorable Michael Soong's January 14, 2018 interlocutory
 order reflecting Gomes' plea of not guilty to the charge of
 criminal trespass in the second degree in violation of HRS 
§ 708-814 (Supp. 2017) and ordering that Gomes appear for bench
 trial in district court criminal case number 5DCC-17-0000454 on
 March 15, 2018.
 
"The right to an appeal is strictly statutory." State
 
v. Ontiveros, 82 Hawai' i 446, 449, 923 P.2d 388, 391 (1996) 
(citation omitted). The Hawai' i Intermediate Court of Appeals 
has jurisdiction "[t]o hear and determine appeals from any court NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
or agency when appeals are allowed by law[.]" HRS § 602-57(1) 
(2016). HRS § 641-12(a) (2016) is the statute providing that "[a]ppeals upon the record shall be allowed from all final decisions and final judgments of district courts in all criminal matters." Consequently, "in order to appeal a criminal matter in the district court, the appealing party must appeal from a written judgment or order that has been filed with the clerk of the court pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(b)(3)." State v. Bohannon, 102 
Hawai'i 228, 236, 74 P.3d 980, 988 (2003); see also Rule 32(c)(2) 
of the Hawai' i Rules of Penal Procedure. And even when the 
district court enters a judgment of conviction, "[j]udgments of conviction are not final unless they include the final adjudication and the final sentence." State v. Kilborn, 109 
Hawai'i 435, 442, 127 P.3d 95, 102 (App. 2005) (dismissing an 
appeal from a district court judgment of conviction that did not finally determine the entire sentence). 
In the instant case, it appears that the district court
 
did not hold a bench trial on March 15, 2018. Instead, the
 district court continued the trial pending the resolution of this
 appeal. Absent an appealable final judgment, however, the
 January 14, 2018 interlocutory order is not eligible for
 appellate review, and Gomes's appeal is premature.

1"Generally, the filing of a notice of appeal divests the
trial court of jurisdiction over the appealed case." TSA 
International Limited v. Shimizu Corporation, 92 Hawai' i 243, 
265, 990 P.2d 713, 735 (1999) (citations omitted). "The general
rule, however, assumes that the notice of appeal is valid underthe applicable statutory provisions and procedural rules. Where 
the notice of appeal is jurisdictionally defective, filing thenotice does not transfer jurisdiction from the trial court to theappellate court." Ontiveros, 82 Hawai' i at 449, 923 P.2d at 391
(citations omitted; emphasis added).
