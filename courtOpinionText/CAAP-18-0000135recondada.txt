APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 2CC171000342) 
ORDER 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Upon review of "Defendant Timmins' Verified Objection 
to April 4th Intermediate Court of Appeals Judgment as Against 
All Defendants and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure; Motion for Court to Reconsider and Take Judicial Notice of the Adjudicative Facts and Law and Dismiss Plaintiff's Irregular Action Accordingly" (Motion for Reconsideration) filed by 
Defendant-Appellant George Emerson Timmins on May 2, 2022, the 
papers in support, and the record, it appears that: 
1. Our summary disposition order was filed on 
April 4, 2022; NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2. Rule 40(a) of the Hawai#i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure requires that a "motion for reconsideration may be 
filed by a party only within 10 days after the filing of the opinion, dispositional order, or ruling unless by special leave additional time is granted during such period by a judge or justice of the appellate court involved"; 
3. Timmins has not requested an extension of time to 
file a motion for reconsideration; and 
4. Timmins' Motion for Reconsideration is untimely. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion for 
Reconsideration is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai#i, May 5, 2022.
