v. 
RYAN M. GIUGLIANO, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 3DTA-17-00652) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Ryan M. Giugliano (Giugliano) 
appeals from the Judgment and Notice of Entry of Judgment, filed 
on February 28, 2018, in the District Court of the Third Circuit 
(District Court). 1
Giugliano was convicted of Operating a Vehicle Under 
the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii 
Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 291E-61(a)(1) (Supp. 2017). 2

          NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On appeal, Giugliano contends that the District Court 
erred by: (1) denying his Motion to Suppress and (2) admitting 
the results of the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN) test. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we 
resolve Giugliano's points of error as follows: 
(1) Giugliano contends that the District Court erred in 
denying the suppression of his post-seizure verbal statements and 
non-verbal communicative responses because he was neither advised 
of his prearrest right to remain silent when Hawai# i County 
Police Officer Bradley Llanes (Officer Llanes) detained Giugliano during an investigatory traffic stop, nor was he advised of his 
Miranda
3 rights prior to being subjected to custodial 
interrogation by Officer Llanes. 
Giugliano relies on State v. Tsujimura, 140 Hawai# i 
299, 400 P.3d 500 (2017), in arguing that he should have been advised of his prearrest right to remain silent once he was 
stopped and that a failure to do so required suppression of his 
verbal statements and non-verbal communications. In Tsujimura, 
the supreme court recognized that the right against 
self-incrimination attaches before arrest under article I, 
section 10 of the Hawai# i Constitution. Id. at 310-11, 400 P.3d 
at 511-12. The court further held that "the State may not use as substantive proof of guilt a defendant's prearrest silence that 
occurs at least as of the time of detention, for doing so would 
3 Miranda v. Arizona , 384 U.S. 436 (1966). 
A critical safeguard [of the privilege against
self-incrimination] is the Miranda warning: an accused must be
"warned that he or she had a right to remain silent, thatanything said could be used against him or her, that he or shehad a right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he orshe could not afford an attorney one would be appointed forhim or her." 
State v. Kazanas
, 
138 Hawai #i 23, 34, 375 P.3d 1261, 1272 (2016) (quoting S
tate 
v. Ketchum , 
97 Hawai #i 107, 116, 34 P.3d 1006, 1015 (2001)). 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
violate the right against compelled self-incrimination under 
article I, section 10 of the Hawai# i Constitution."  Id. at 314, 
400 P.3d at 515. 
Tsujimura does not stand for the proposition that a 
defendant must be informed of his right to remain silent at the initiation of a traffic stop. Tsujimura involved the use of a 
defendant's prearrest silence as substantive proof of guilt, 
rather than using a defendant's prearrest statements and acts as 
substantive proof of guilt. Thus, Tsujimura is distinguishable 
and Giugliano's reliance on that case is misplaced. 
Giugliano next contends that his verbal statements, 
including his responses to medical rule-out questions, and 
non-verbal communicative acts during his participation in the 
standardized field sobriety tests (SFSTs) should have been 
suppressed because they resulted from custodial interrogation and 
he was not first advised of his Miranda rights. 
The proponent of the motion to suppress has the burden of
establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that thestatements or items sought to be excluded were unlawfullysecured and that his or her right to be free fromunreasonable searches or seizures was violated under the fourth amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 7 of the Hawai #i Constitution. See State 
v. Wilson, 92 Hawai #i 45, 48, 987 P.2d 268, 271 (1999)
(citations omitted). 
State v. Kaleohano, 99 Hawai# i 370, 375, 56 P.3d 138, 143 (2002). 
Where an individual is being subjected to custodialinterrogation, he may not be asked any questions without hisfirst being advised of his right to remain silent, thatanything he says can and will be used against him, that hehas the right to have his attorney present, and that if hecannot afford counsel, one will be appointed for him priorto any interrogation. Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436,
467-474 (1966); State v. Santiago, 53 Haw. 254, 492 P.2d 657(1971). "Custodial interrogation" means "questioninginitiated by law enforcement officers after a person hasbeen taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedomof action in any significant way." [Miranda], 384 U.S. at
444. 
State v. Kalai, 56 Haw. 366, 368, 537 P.2d 8, 11 (1975) (emphasis 
omitted). 
"To determine whether 'interrogation' is 'custodial,' 
we look to the totality of the circumstances, focusing on 'the

       NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
place and time of the interrogation, the length of the 
interrogation, the nature of the questions asked, the conduct of 
the police, and any other relevant circumstances.'" State v. Ah 
Loo, 94 Hawai# i 207, 210, 10 P.3d 728, 731 (2000) (brackets 
omitted) (quoting State v. Melemai, 64 Haw. 479, 481, 643 P.2d 
541, 544 (1982)). "In this regard, we have acknowledged that 'no 
precise line can be drawn' between 'custodial interrogation,' on 
the one hand, and 'permissible general on-the-scene questioning,' 
on the other." Id. (quoting State v. Patterson, 59 Haw. 357, 
362, 581 P.2d 752, 755-56 (1978)). 
On this appeal of the lower court's denial of a motion 
to suppress, we look at both the record of the hearing on the motion to suppress and the record of the trial. State v. Vinuya, 
96 Hawai# i 472, 481, 32 P.3d 116, 125 (App. 2001). At the 
hearing on the Motion to Suppress, Officer Llanes testified that 
he initiated a traffic stop of Giugliano on suspicion of not 
wearing a seat belt while operating his vehicle
4 in the vicinity 
of the Old Airport Beach Park in the County of Hawai# i. Upon 
stopping Giugliano, Officer Llanes informed Giugliano of the 
reason he was stopped and then observed Giugliano to have red, 
watery, glassy eyes and a strong odor of intoxicants emanating 
from him. Based on those observations, Officer Llanes asked 
Giugliano to exit the vehicle and to participate in the SFSTs. 
At trial, Officer Llanes additionally stated that, prior to 
administering the SFSTs,5 he asked Giugliano medical rule-out 
4 HRS ยง 291-11.6, entitled "Mandatory use of seat belts, when,
penalty" provides in relevant part: 
(a) Except as otherwise provided by law, no person shall
operate a motor vehicle upon any public highway unless the
person is restrained by a seat belt assembly and allpassengers in the front or back seat of the motor vehicle arerestrained by a seat belt assembly or are restrained pursuantto section 291-11.5 if under eight years of age. 
5 Officer Llanes testified at trial that the SFSTs consist of the HGN 
test, Walk-and-Turn test, and the One-leg Stand test. 
4         
           
              
               
              
        NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
questions.6 Giugliano responded "no" to all of the questions, 
but noted that he normally stutters. Officer Llanes then 
instructed Giugliano on how to do the SFSTs and asked if he 
understood the instructions, which Giguliano indicated he did. 
Giugliano then exited his vehicle and participated in the SFSTs, 
after which he was placed under arrest for OVUII. The record 
indicates that Giugliano was also cited for operating his vehicle 
without being restrained by a seat belt assembly, which proceeded 
as a separate case. 
Giugliano claims that he was in custody because, 
"[c]learly, at the point where Officer Llanes requested that 
Giugliano get out of his car, Giguliano was the focus of an OVUII 
investigation and he was not free to leave." 
In Ah Loo, the court stated: 
[W]e affirm the principle that, when an officer lawfully
"seizes" a person in order to conduct an investigative stop,the officer is not required to inform that person of his orher Miranda rights before posing questions that arereasonably designed to confirm or dispel -- as briefly aspossible and without any coercive connotation by either wordor conduct -- the officer's reasonable suspicion thatcriminal activity is afoot. 
94 Hawai# i at 212, 10 P.3d at 733. Ah Loo makes clear that a 
defendant is not in custody for purposes of Miranda merely 
because he or she has been pulled over pursuant to a valid 
traffic stop. Kaleohano, 99 Hawai# i at 376, 56 P.3d at 144.  The 
court in Ah Loo stated: 
[A]n individual may very well be "seized," within the
meaning of article I, section 7 of the Hawai #i Constitution 
(inasmuch as, "given the totality of the circumstances, areasonable person would have believed that he or she was notfree to leave") and yet not be "in custody," such thatMiranda warnings are required as a precondition to anyquestioning. 
94 Hawai# i at 211, 10 P.3d at 732 (citation omitted). 
6 Officer Llanes testified at trial that the medical rule-out 
questions consisted of asking Giugliano: (1) whether he had any physical defects
or speech impediments; (2) whether he was under the care of a doctor or dentist;(3) whether he was blind in either eye or had an artificial eye; (4) whether he
was under the care of an eye doctor; (5) whether he was currently taking anymedication; and (6) whether he was epileptic or diabetic. 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
If probable cause to arrest or sustained and coercive 
questioning are present, then questions posed by the police could 
amount to custodial interrogation. Kaleohano, 99 Hawai# i at 377, 
56 P.3d at 145. 
Unlike cases in which we have held that a defendant was 
in custody almost immediately after being stopped because the police officer had probable cause to arrest the defendant for a 
criminal offense, see State v. Sagapolutele-Silva, No. 
CAAP-19-0000491, 2020 WL 1699907, at *6 (Haw. App. Apr. 8, 2020), 
as corrected (June 1, 2020), as amended (June 8, 2020), Giugliano 
was stopped by the officer for failing to wear a seat belt, in 
violation of HRS ยง 291โ11.6, which is a civil traffic infraction 
and not a criminal offense. See State v. Ribbel, 111 Hawai# i 
426, 428, 142 P.3d 290, 292 (2006). Giugliano was therefore not in custody at the moment he was pulled over for the traffic stop. 
See State v. Kuba, 68 Hawai# i 184, 188, 706 P.2d 1305, 1309 
(1985) ("Where . . . the seizure of the defendant is reasonable to investigate a traffic violation and the investigating police 
officer engages in legitimate, straightforward, and noncoercive 
questioning necessary to obtain information to issue a traffic 
citation, there is no custodial interrogation; no Miranda 
warnings are required before the police officer begins asking 
questions."). 
Contrary to his assertion, Giugliano was also not in 
custody for OVUII at the point where Officer Llanes observed 
Giuglano to have red, watery, glassy eyes and an odor of 
intoxicants about him, and requested that Giugliano exit the 
vehicle. Giugliano's red, watery, glassy eyes and the strong 
odor of intoxicants emanating from him were sufficient to justify 
Officer Llanes asking Giugliano to exit the vehicle. See 
Vallesteros, 84 Hawai# i at 302, 933 P.2d at 639 ("[A] police 
officer must have at least a reasonable basis of specific 
articulable facts to believe a crime has been committed to order 
a driver out of a car after a traffic stop" (quoting State v. 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Kim, 68 Haw. 286, 290, 711 P.2d 1291, 1294) (1985)); State v. 
Barrickman, 95 Hawai# i 270, 274-77, 21 P.3d 475, 479-82 (App. 
2001) (holding that there was reasonable suspicion to investigate driving while intoxicated based on defendant's glassy eyes and 
smell of alcohol on breath). However, these observations did not 
initially amount to probable cause to arrest Giugliano for OVUII. 
See Sagapolutele-Silva, No. CAAP-19-0000491, 2020 WL 1699907, at 
*6 (determining that police did not initially have probable cause 
to arrest a defendant for OVUII based upon noticing she had red, 
watery, and glassy eyes and an odor of alcohol about her). As a 
result, Giugliano was not in custody at the time Officer Llanes 
requested that Giugliano exit his vehicle and proceeded to ask 
Giugliano the medical rule-out questions. Therefore, Miranda 
warnings were not required at that point and the District Court 
did not err in admitting Giugliano's responses to the medical 
rule-out questions. See Ah Loo, 94 Hawai# i at 211, 10 P.3d at 
732; Kuba, 68 Haw. at 184, 706 P.2d at 1306 (holding that Miranda warnings were not required before investigative questioning 
regarding suspicion of alcohol or drug impairment during a valid 
traffic stop); State v. Wyatt, 67 Haw. 293, 300-01, 687 P.2d 544, 
550 (1984) (holding that, during a valid traffic stop, police 
officer was not required to issue Miranda warnings prior to 
asking motorist if she had been drinking). 
The District Court also did not err in admitting the 
observations of Giugliano's performance on the SFSTs or 
Giugliano's responses to being asked to participate in the SFSTs 
and to the instructions. The right against self-incrimination is 
not necessarily implicated whenever a person suspected of 
criminal activity is compelled in some way to cooperate in 
developing evidence which may be used against him. Wyatt, 67 
Haw. at 302, 687 P.2d at 551. In Wyatt, the court stated that observations of a defendant's performance on the SFSTs was an 
exhibition of physical characteristics of coordination. Id. at 
303, 687 P.2d at 551. Thus, the Wyatt court held that since 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
performance on the SFSTs was neither communication nor testimony, 
the trial court did not err by refusing to suppress the SFST 
observations. Id. at 301-03, 687 P.2d at 550-51. Similarly, 
except as discussed infra, the District Court did not err in 
admitting Officer Llanes's observation of Giugliano's performance 
on the SFSTs. The District Court also did not err in admitting 
Giugliano's responses to being asked to participate in the SFSTs 
and to the instructions because these questions are necessarily 
attendant to a legitimate police procedure and did not amount to 
"interrogation." See Pennsylvania v. Muniz, 496 U.S. 582, 605 
(1990) (determining that a police officer's questioning of a defendant regarding whether the defendant understood the field 
sobriety test instructions and wished to submit to the test did 
not amount to an "interrogation" because they were "limited and 
focused inquiries [that] were necessarily 'attendant to' the 
legitimate police procedure, and were not likely to be perceived 
as calling for any incriminating response." (citation omitted)). 
(2) Giugliano claims that the District Court abused its 
discretion by admitting the result of the HGN test because it 
lacked proper foundation and could not be used as substantive 
evidence of impairment. Giugliano further asserts that the error 
was not harmless. 
In State v. Ito, this court held: "Before HGN test 
results can be admitted into evidence in a particular case, . . . 
it must be shown that (1) the officer administering the test was 
duly qualified to conduct the test and grade the test results; 
and (2) the test was performed properly in the instant case." 90 
Hawai# i 225, 244, 978 P.2d 191, 210 (App. 1999) (citations 
omitted). We further concluded that the evidence presented at the trial in that case failed to demonstrate that the officer was 
duly qualified to conduct the HGN test and grade the test results 
because, inter alia, it was not clear whether a standard training 
program that the officer received met the requirements of the 
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and whether the 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
officer received periodic retraining to refresh himself on his 
HGN test administration skills. Id. 
In this case, Officer Keith Nacis (Officer Nacis) 
testified that the National Highway Transportation Safety 
Administration, and not the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration, provided him with a manual which he used to train 
Officer Llanes. Even if Officer Nacis's misidentification of the 
entity is excused, there was no evidence that the training 
Officer Llanes received met the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration (NHTSA) requirements. There was no evidence as to 
what the manual stated regarding training requirements and 
whether Officer Llanes met those requirements. Officer Llanes 
stated that he was provided a manual during training but could 
not recall if it was from the NHTSA. Officer Nacis also stated 
that he did not instruct officers during training to check 
themselves on a monthly basis to make sure they can estimate a 45 
degree angle on the HGN test. Officer Llanes's testimony did not 
indicate that he engaged in periodic retraining to refresh 
himself on his HGN test administration skills. Thus, there was 
insufficient evidence to demonstrate that Officer Llanes was duly 
qualified to administer the HGN test and grade the results. 
Because there was insufficient foundational evidence that Officer 
Llanes was qualified to administer and grade the test results, we 
need not address whether he properly performed the HGN test in 
the instant case. Therefore, the District Court erred by 
admitting the results of the HGN test. Based on our 
determination that the District Court erred in the admission of 
this evidence, it is unnecessary to address Giugliano's 
contention that the results were inadmissible outside of the 
context of probable cause determinations. 
Nonetheless, the erroneous admission of the HGN test 
results was harmless because there was a wealth of overwhelming 
and compelling evidence tending to show Giugliano was guilty of 
OVUII beyond a reasonable doubt. See State v. Mitchell, 94 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawai# i 388, 400, 15 P.3d 314, 326 (App. 2000). 
At trial, Officer Llanes testified as a witness with 
specialized training to administer the other SFSTs and from 
personal experience. Giugliano does not contend that there was a 
lack of foundation regarding Officer Llanes's testimony 
pertaining to his observations of the other SFSTs. See Hawai# i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4) (2016) ("Points [of error] not presented [in the opening brief] in accordance 
with this section will be disregarded, except that the appellate 
court, at its option, may notice a plain error not presented."); 
HRAP Rule 28(b)(7) (2016) ("Points not argued [in the opening 
brief] may be deemed waived."). Therefore, Officer Llanes could 
testify about his observations of Giugliano's performance on the 
SFSTs, other than the HGN test, and give an opinion, based on 
such observations, whether Giugliano was intoxicated. See State 
v. Ferrer, 95 Hawai# i 409, 429, 23 P.3d 744, 764 (App. 2001) 
("[I]t is permissible for a police officer to testify as a lay 
witness about his or her observations of a defendant's 
performance on various [S]FSTs and to give an opinion, based on 
such observations, that the defendant was intoxicated. However, 
unless proper foundation is laid, it is improper for a police 
officer to testify that in his or her opinion, a defendant 
'failed' or 'passed' a [S]FST." (citing State v. Nishi, 9 Haw. 
App. 516, 852 P.2d 476 (1993) and State v. Toyomura, 80 Hawai# i 
8, 904 P.2d 893 (1995)). 
At trial, Officer Llanes testified that Giugliano's 
behavior was erratic, switching from compliant and calm to argumentative and angry, and that he was repeating himself. 
Officer Llanes also observed Giugliano to have red, watery, 
glassy eyes, and a strong odor of an intoxicating beverage 
emanating from his breath and person. During the Walk-and-Turn 
test, Giugliano stepped out of the instructional position, failed 
to keep his balance, missed several heel-to-toe steps during the 
initial nine steps, took ten steps instead of nine steps, did not 
10 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
turn as instructed, raised both arms almost parallel to the 
ground, and stopped walking, all contrary to the instructions. 
During the One-leg Stand test, Giugliano raised his arms 
approximately two feet from his waist, put his foot down and 
asked if the test was done after counting to ten, and put his 
foot back up and began counting from one when he was informed the 
test was not done, all contrary to the instructions. Officer 
Llanes testified that based on his training and personal 
experience, these were indicia or clues of intoxication and that 
Giugliano was unable to operate his vehicle in a safe manner. On 
this record, there was substantial evidence for a trier of fact 
to conclude that Giugliano was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt 
of OVUII. State v. Matavale, 115 Hawai# i 149, 157-58, 166 P.3d 
322, 330-31 (2007). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment and 
Notice of Entry of Judgment, filed on February 28, 2018, in the District Court of the Third Circuit is affirmed.
