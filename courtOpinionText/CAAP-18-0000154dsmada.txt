APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
(S.P. NO. 17-1-0027)#
ORDER GRANTING MARCH 28, 2018 MOTION TO DISMISS APPELLATE COURT
CASE NUMBER CAAP-18-0000154 FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
Upon review of (1) Plaintiff-Appellant State of
Hawaii's (the State) March 28, 2018 "Notice of Withdrawal of
Appeal" in appellate court case number CAAP-18-0000154 for lack
of appellate jurisdiction, which we deem to be a motion by the
State to voluntarily dismiss its own appeal, and (2) the lack of
any memorandum by Claimant-Appellee Lucky G Enterprises, Inc.
(Lucky G Enterprises), it appears that the State correctly
asserts that we lack appellate jurisdiction over the State's
appeal from the Honorable Greg K. Nakamura's February 12, 2018 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
interlocutory "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order
Granting Claimant Lucky G Enterprises, Inc.'s Motion for Summary
Judgment in Favor of Claimant as to the State of Hawaii's
Verified Petition" (the February 12, 2018 interlocutory order) in
S.P. No. 17-1-0027, because the circuit court has not yet reduced
the February 12, 2018 interlocutory order to a separate judgment
that resolves all claims as to all parties.
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-1(a) (2016)
authorizes appeals to the Hawai #i Intermediate Court of Appeals
from final judgments, orders, or decrees.  Appeals under HRS
ยง 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules
of court."  HRS ยง 641-1(c).  Rule 58 of the Hawai# i Rules of
Civil Procedure (HRCP) requires that "[e]very judgment shall be
set forth on a separate document."  The Hawai #i Rules of Civil
Procedure such as HRCP Rule 58 apply to, among other things,
"[p]roceedings for the forfeiture of property for violation of a
statute[.]" HRCP Rule 81(b)(6).  The Supreme Court of Hawai #i has
held that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders
have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered
in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to
HRCP [Rule] 58[.]"  Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright , 
76 Hawai# i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994).  "Thus, based on
Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it
resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been
reduced to a separate judgment."  Carlisle v. One (1) Boat , 119
Hawai#i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008).
In the instant case, the February 12, 2018
interlocutory order does not, on its face, appear to resolve all
claims as to all parties ( e.g.,  the February 12, 2018
interlocutory order does not expressly resolve the State's
petition as to Claimants-Appellees Glenn Haraguchi and Lance
Yamada).  More importantly, the circuit court has not yet reduced
the circuit court's dispositive rulings to a separate judgment,
as HRS ยง 641-1(a) and HRCP Rule 58 require for an appeal from a
civil circuit court case under the holding in Jenkins.  Absent an
appealable final judgment, we lack appellate jurisdiction, and
the State's appeal is premature.
-2-NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Although the State filed a March 28, 2018 notice of
withdrawal of its appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction, Rule
42 of the Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) does not
authorize an appellant to unilaterally withdraw an appeal, but,
instead, HRAP Rule 42 authorizes the voluntary dismissal of an
appeal as follows:
Rule 42. Dismissal
(a) Dismissal before the appeal is docketed. If an
appeal has not been docketed, the appeal shall be dismissed
upon the filing of a stipulation for dismissal signed by all
the parties and approved by the appellate court. Upon motion
and notice by the appellant, the appellate court may dismiss
the appeal upon terms fixed by the court.
(b) Dismissal in the appellate courts. If the parties
to a docketed appeal or other proceeding sign and file a
stipulation for dismissal, specifying the terms as to
payment of costs, and pay whatever fees are due, the case
shall be dismissed upon approval by the appellate court, but
no mandate or other process shall issue without an order of
the court. 
Upon motion and notice, the appellate court may
dismiss the appeal upon terms fixed by the appellate court.
(c) Special Requirements for Criminal Appeals. In a
criminal appeal by a defendant, the 
stipulation or motion
for dismissal of the appeal shall be supported by the
defendant's affidavit or declaration that reflects a knowing
and intelligent understanding of the consequences of the
dismissal of the appeal and that the withdrawal is made
voluntarily. In circumstances where the defendant cannot be
located after a diligent effort, the circumstances of the
effort shall be set forth in an affidavit or declaration of
counsel in support of the stipulation or motion.
(Emphases added).  Based on HRAP Rule 42, we deem the State's
March 28, 2018 notice of withdrawal to be, in effect, a motion by
the State to voluntarily dismiss its own appeal.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the State's
March 28, 2018 motion to voluntarily dismiss its own appeal is
granted, and appellate court case number CAAP-18-0000154 is
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, April 13, 2018.
