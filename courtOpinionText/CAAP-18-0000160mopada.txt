For the reasons discussed below, we vacate the Judgment 
and remand for further proceedings.
I. Background
A. Issuance of Search Warrant 
In the affidavit attached to the search warrant, Kaua# i 
County Police Department (KPD
) Officer Colin Nesbitt (Officer 
Nesbitt) attested to the following: 
In July 2012, he received a tip from a "cooperative 
source" that Sarmiento was distributing crystal methamphetamine 
from an older model, white four-door sedan with license plate ending in 524. 
Officer Nesbitt compared the source's description to 
KPD records and showed a photo of Sarmiento to the source, who confirmed it was the same person. Officer Nesbitt and Sergeant Darren Rose (Sergeant Rose
) arranged for the controlled purchase 
of crystal methamphetamine from Sarmiento by the cooperative source. Sometime between July 5 and 9, 2012, they met with the source at a prearranged location in the Kawaihau District, and 
6 Co-defendant Salvas was also convicted on certain charges and
appealed her convictions. See State v. Salvas, No. CAAP-18-0000121, 2021 WL
276150 (Haw. App. Jan. 27, 2021) (SDO). 
7 Salvas filed the subject Motion on April 26, 2016, and Sarmiento
filed a joinder in the motion on May 3, 2016. 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
searched the source's vehicle for illegal narcotics, contraband, 
weapons or money and found none. 
Officer Nesbitt recorded serial numbers on money from 
the KPD "buy fund" and gave the money to the source. The source made prior arrangements to meet Sarmiento at a predetermined location to purchase crystal methamphetamine. The officers instructed the source to travel along a prearranged route to the place of the buy, purchase an amount of drugs, and reunite with the officers at a second meet location. Sergeant Rose and Officer Nesbitt followed and monitored the source using unmarked vehicles to ensure that the source did not have contact with anyone along the route. 
Sarmiento was at the buy location when the source and 
the officers arrived and was standing next to the driver's side of a white, four-door Dodge sedan with the license plate HFM-524. Sarmiento approached the source's vehicle and met with the source. 
After a few minutes, the source left the buy location 
and traveled directly to the meet location. Sergeant Rose and Officer Nesbitt followed and monitored the source from the buy location to the second meet location. At the second meet location, the source gave Officer Nesbitt a small clear packet containing a white crystalline substance. The officers searched the source and the source's vehicle for illegal narcotics, contraband, weapons or money a second time and found none. Officer Nesbitt tested the crystalline substance using a field test, and the sample tested presumptively positive for the presence of methamphetamine. 
Officer Nesbitt further attested that the source 
relayed the details of the controlled buy, including that the source "met with Sarmiento at his white in color Dodge four door sedan" and the source handed Sarmiento the agreed amount of money in exchange for the agreed amount of crystal methamphetamine. Officer Nesbitt attested that the disclosure of the source's identity would impair the effectiveness of the source to law 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
enforcement and that the source fears for his or her safety if 
the source's identity was revealed. 
Regarding the source's reliability, Officer Nesbitt 
attested that: 
while participating in this controlled purchase of Crystal
Methamphetamine from Sarmiento as well as other controlledpurchases the [Source] has been proven to be reliable andcredible. That this controlled purchase from Sarmiento isconsistent with other controlled purchases conducted bymembers of the Kauai Police Department's Vice NarcoticsUnit. The [Source] has participated in more than 30 unrelatedcontrolled purchases. As a result of these unrelatedpurchases in unrelated cases completed by the [Source], 19state search warrants have been obtained, 19 persons havebeen arrested, illegal narcotics, drug paraphernalia andguns were recovered and seized into evidence. The [Source]has been proven to be reliable and credible. 
Officer Nesbitt ran a check on the white Dodge four-
door sedan with the full license plate and learned that the 
vehicle was registered to Salvas. Further investigation revealed that Sarmiento and Salvas were "live in boyfriend/girlfriend sharing the same address" as listed in the vehicle registration. Officer Nesbitt located the vehicle at the registered address and confirmed that it was the same vehicle used during the controlled buy. 
On July 10, 2012, the District Court of the Fifth 
Circuit
8 granted a search warrant for Sarmiento's person, 
Salvas's Dodge sedan, and any luggage, bags, packages, containers, and clothing within the vehicle.
B. Execution of Search Warrant 
At trial, Officer Nesbitt and Sergeant Rose testified 
to the execution of the search warrant as follows: 
Around noon on July 13, 2012, a team from KPD arrived 
at the Defendants' residence in Kapa# a. Officer Nesbitt was 
alerted by another KPD officer that the Dodge left the residence. 
Officer Nesbitt saw the Dodge on Kawaihau Road and followed the vehicle for approximately three or four minutes before losing 
8 The Honorable Trudy Senda signed the search warrant. 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 sight of it. Sergeant Rose testified that he saw the Dodge 
parked on an overgrown one lane "cane haul road" that connected 
Hauiki Road and Waipouli Road. Sergeant Rose was in an unmarked 
regular vehicle. He informed the other officers assigned to the operation of his location and waited for Officer Eric Caspillo (Officer Caspillo), who was in a marked patrol car. When 
Sergeant Rose pulled up behind the Dodge, with Officer Caspillo 
behind him, the Dodge "took off." 
Sergeant Rose and Officer Caspillo pursued the vehicle, 
and the Dodge pulled over to the grassy shoulder at the intersection of Hauiki and Olohena Roads and stopped. Officer Caspillo pulled his vehicle in front of the Dodge but did not completely block the front of the Dodge. The Dodge accelerated forward, struck the marked police vehicle, went over a small berm or embankment, and went up Olohena Road. Sergeant Rose pursued the Dodge and notified the other officers of his location and the pursuit. 
After about three-quarters of a mile, Sergeant Rose 
testified he saw an object ejected from the passenger window and pulled over to the side to retrieve it. Sergeant Rose retrieved a glass bong containing a red liquid from the grass and continued the pursuit. He did not photograph the area where he retrieved the bong or the bong itself. 
The other officers stopped the Dodge on Olohena Road, 
about a mile from where Sergeant Rose had stopped to pick up the bong. Sergeant Rose identified the driver of the Dodge as Sarmiento and the passenger as Salvas. At the scene of the stop, Sergeant Rose gave the bong to Officer Nesbitt, who transferred the liquid inside to a jar at KPD headquarters and submitted it into evidence. The Dodge was towed to KPD headquarters, where it was searched by Officers Nesbitt, Caspillo, and Arnold Cayabyab, 
under Sergeant Rose's supervision. The jar's contents and items 
recovered from the Dodge were sent to the Honolulu Police 
Department lab for analysis.

II. Discussion 
A. Motion to Identify Confidential Informant 
Sarmiento first alleges that the Circuit Court erred by 
not ordering the State to disclose the identity of the 
confidential informant who participated in the controlled buy. We disagree. 
On May 16, 2014, Sarmiento moved to identify the 
confidential informant arguing, inter alia, that the confidential informant lied about purchasing methamphetamine from him, and even if the declarations in Officer Nesbitt's affidavit were true, the affidavit did not establish probable cause to search Salvas's vehicle. In his declaration attached to the motion, Sarmiento attested that he "did not sell anyone any methamphetamine for the period from July 5 to July 9, 2012" and he "did not transport, possess, or store any methamphetamine in Defendant Michelle Salvas's vehicle during the time period from July 5 to July 9, 2012." 
After hearing the motion on June 10, 2014, the Circuit 
Court denied Sarmiento's motion. On October 21, 2014, the Circuit Court entered its Findings of Fact/Conclusions of Law explaining its denial of the motion pursuant to Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 510 and Hawai# i Rules of Penal Procedure 
(
HRPP) Rule 16(e)(5)(ii),9 stating: 
Upon this Court's review of the pleadings and arguments of
counsel, it appears that the informer is not going to becalled to testify at trial because the information providedby the informer was not the basis for any of the offensescharged against Defendant, the informer did not activelyparticipate in any of the offenses charged, and the proof ofDefendant's guilt depended on the circumstances at the timethe warrant was executed and not on any information suppliedby the informer; and therefore, HRE Rule 510(c)(2) does not 
9 HRPP Rule 16(e)(5)(ii) provides: 
(ii) Informants. Disclosure of an informant's identity shallnot be required where the informant's identity is aprosecution secret and a failure to disclose will notinfringe the constitutional rights of the defendant.Disclosure shall not be denied hereunder of the identity ofa witness intended to be produced at a hearing or trial.

apply. [State v.] Kapiko, 88 Haw. [396,] 402[, 967 P.2d 228,
234 (1998)] 
This Court finds that the prosecution does not base its case
against Defendant on activity Defendant might haveundertaken in the presence of the informer, but rather onevidence of the defendant's knowing possession of the drugsat the time of the search warrant's execution on July 13,2012. 
. . . . 
The Court is satisfied that the information was received from an informant reasonably believed to be reliable orcredible. 
This Court finds that the public interest in protecting the
flow of information, outweighs the possible significance ofthe informer's testimony and Defendant's due process andconfrontation clause rights, and as such, the State is notrequired to disclose the information pursuant to [HRPP] Rule16(e)(5)(ii). 
Under HRE Rule 510, the prosecution "has a privilege to 
refuse to disclose the identity of a person who has furnished 
information relating to or assisting in an investigation of a possible violation of law to a law enforcement officer[.]" HRE Rule 510(a). This privilege applies as long as the defendant's constitutional rights are not infringed. See HRPP Rule 
16(e)(5)(ii); State v. Rodrigues, 88 Hawai# i 363, 368, 966 P.2d 
1089, 1094 (1998); see also HRE 510 cmt. (1980) ("The intent of the rule is to balance the necessity for effective law enforcement machinery and the requirement of constitutional safeguards for the defendant."). 
It has long been recognized that the determination to 
disclose an informant's identity requires "balancing the public interest in protecting the flow of information against the individual's right to prepare his defense." Roviaro v. United 
States, 353 U.S. 53, 62 (1957). To determine whether information regarding an informant must be disclosed, the Hawai# i Supreme 
Court adopted the following test as set forth by the United States Supreme Court: 
Whether a proper balance renders nondisclosure erroneous
must depend on the particular circumstances of each case,taking into consideration the crime charged, the possibledefenses, the possible significance of the informer'stestimony, and other relevant factors. 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
State v. Opupele, 88 Hawai# i 433, 438, 967 P.2d 265, 270 (1998) 
(citations omitted). 
When applying this balancing test, the U.S. and Hawai# i 
Supreme Courts have held that neither the federal nor Hawai
#i 
state constitution requires the prosecution to disclose an 
informant's identity "where the sole purpose is to challenge the finding of probable cause." State v. Iwatate, 108 Hawai# i 361, 
370, 120 P.3d 260, 269 (App. 2005); McCray v. Illinois, 386 U.S. 300, 312-13 (1967). 
However, "[a] trial court may, in its 
discretion, require disclosure if it believes that the officer's testimony regarding the informer is inaccurate or untruthful." Iwatate, 108 Hawai# i at 370, 120 P.3d at 269 (quoting State v. 
Delaney, 58 Haw. 19, 24, 563 P.2d 990, 994 (1977)) (brackets omitted). Furthermore, "[t]he judge has the power to require disclosure if he believes it necessary, as where the defendant has thrown some doubt on the officer's credibility, just as he would in examining an officer on an application for a warrant." State v. Texeira, 50 Haw. 138, 147, 433 P.2d 593, 600 (1967). See also HRE Rule 510(c)(3). 
Here, the Circuit Court concluded that the informant's 
testimony was unnecessary at trial because he or she was not involved in the crime for which Sarmiento was charged, that is, possession of methamphetamine and paraphernalia on July 13, 2012. Given the record, the Circuit Court did not err in this ruling because Sarmiento's confrontation rights were not implicated and the exception under HRE Rule 510(c)(2) does not apply. See 
Kapiko, 88 Hawai# i at 402, 967 P.2d at 234 (holding the 
prosecution was not required to disclose the identity of the confidential informant because HRE Rule 510(c)(2) "pertains only to a situation where it is anticipated that the [informant] will give testimony necessary to a fair determination of the guilt or innocence in a criminal case"); cf. State v. Bullen, 63 Haw. 27, 32, 620 P.2d 728, 731 (1980) ("where the informant has been an active participant in the crime charged, and his testimony might 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
be helpful to the defense, fairness dictates that his identity be 
disclosed by the government."). 
In turn, HRE Rule 510(c)(3) provides an exception where 
the judge believes that the confidential informant is not reliable or credible. Rodrigues, 88 Hawai# i at 367, 966 P.2d at 
1093. 
"An affidavit in support of a finding of probable cause 
should 'set forth some of the underlying circumstances from which the police concluded that the objects sought to be recovered were where they claimed they were, and disclose some of the underlying reasons from which the affiant concluded that the information was reliable.'" State v. Phillips, 138 Hawai# i 321, 346, 382 P.3d 
133, 158 (2016) (quoting State v. Sepa
, 72 Haw. 141, 143-44, 808 
P.2d 848, 850 (1991)) (internal quotations omitted). Although "an averment of previous reliability" supports a finding that the informant is credible, see, e.g., State v. Davenport, 55 Haw. 90, 97, 516 P.2d 65, 70 (1973) (citing Texeira, 50 Haw. at 139, 433 P.2d at 595 (holding the "provision by informer of 'accurate' information on twenty to thirty occasions satisfies 'credibility' prong of Aguilar [v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108 (1964)]")), it has not been suggested that a prior history is necessary or required. State v. Navas, 81 Hawai# i 29, 36, 911 P.2d 1101, 1108 (App. 
1995) (hereinafter Navas I). "[T]he inquiry is, as it always 
must be in determining probable cause, whether the informant's 
present information is truthful or reliable." Id. (quoting State 
v. Sherlock, 70 Haw. 271, 274, 768 P.2d 1290, 1292 (1989)). The reliability of a confidential source's present information can be supported when the details are corroborated or independently verified by law enforcement. See id.; State v. Yaw, 58 Haw. 485, 
572 P.2d 856 (1977). 
In this case, Officer Nesbitt attested that the source 
had participated in more than 30 controlled buys, leading to 19 search warrants and 19 arrests for illegal drugs, paraphernalia, and weapons, and attested that the source "has been proven to be reliable and credible." Further, on the day of the controlled purchase from Sarmiento, Officer Nesbitt and Sergeant Rose 
10 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 followed and monitored the source to and from the place of the 
transaction, and saw Sarmiento talking with the source. Officer Nesbitt traced the registration of the vehicle that Sarmiento stood beside to Salvas, and attested that he later saw the vehicle at Sarmiento and Salvas's residence. Thus, Officer Nesbitt's observations sufficiently corroborated the source's statements. Accordingly, the HRE 501(c)(3) exception does not apply and the Circuit Court correctly denied Sarmiento's motion to disclose the source's identity.
B. Motion to Quash Search Warrant and Suppress Evidence 
Sarmiento alleges error where the Circuit Court denied 
Salvas's Motion to Quash, which he orally joined at the hearing. 
In the Motion to Quash, the defendants argued, inter alia, that the January 13, 2016 federal indictment of KPD Lieutenant Karen Kapua (Lt. Kapua) on three counts of theft from an organization receiving federal funds and one count of money laundering could lead to an inference of falsity in Officer Nesbitt's affidavit. Arguing Officer Nesbitt's affidavit contained false statements, the Motion to Quash also sought an evidentiary hearing pursuant to Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978). 
Relying on three cases, United States v. McDonald, 723 
F.2d 1288 (7th Cir. 1983), United States v. Napier, 436 F.3d 1133 (9th Cir. 2006), and United States v. Igbo, Nos. 90-50406, 91-50027, 1993 WL 164865 (9th Cir. May 18, 1993) (unpublished), the Circuit Court concluded that "the defendants have not met their burden for a substantial preliminary showing that overcomes the validity of the warrant, and they're not entitled to a Franks hearing." 
On appeal, Sarmiento argues the Circuit Court abused 
its discretion in denying the Motion to Quash because the evidence regarding Lt. Kapua was evidence substantial enough to warrant a Franks hearing. We disagree. 
An affidavit supporting a search warrant carries a 
presumption of validity. McDonald, 723 F.2d at 1293–94 (quoting 
11 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 Franks, 438 U.S. at 171). However, the U.S. Supreme Court 
emphasized that this presumption can be rebutted "where the defendant makes a substantial preliminary showing that a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth, was included by the affiant in the warrant affidavit[.]" Franks, 438 U.S. at 155-56. "[I]f the allegedly 
false statement is necessary to the finding of probable cause, the Fourth Amendment requires that a hearing be held at the defendant's request." Id., 438 U.S. at 156. 
"To mandate an evidentiary hearing, the challenger's 
attack must be more than conclusory and must be supported by more than a mere desire to cross-examine." McDonald, 723 F.2d at 1293 
(quoting Franks, 438 U.S. at 171). The allegations of deliberate falsehood or of reckless disregard for the truth should point out specifically the portion of the warrant affidavit that is claimed to be false and must be accompanied by an offer of proof. Id. at 
1293-94. 
Here, Sarmiento's offer of proof that Officer Nesbitt's 
affidavit was inaccurate or untruthful was his own declaration that he did not sell drugs during the period stated in the affidavit. However, a defendant's "self-serving and doubtful denial" that he sold drugs during the period in question, without more, does not make a "substantial preliminary showing of [an] entitlement to a Franks hearing." Napier, 436 F.3d at 1139; 
Igbo, 1993 WL 164865 at *1. Further, except for broad accusations of police misconduct and the assertion that Lt. Kapua would have needed the cooperation of other individuals, Sarmiento fails to indicate how Lt. Kapua's indictment was material to this case or to Officer Nesbitt's affidavit. Finally, the federal indictment against Lt. Kapua alleges events that took place in 2013 and 2014, more than a year and a half after the search and arrest in this case. 
12 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Based on this record, the Circuit Court did not err in 
denying an evidentiary hearing regarding the search warrant; nor 
did it err in denying the Motion to Quash.
C. Motion to Compel Discovery 
Sarmiento next alleges that the Circuit Court abused 
its discretion in denying Salvas's motion to compel discovery, in 
which Sarmiento had joined. Sarmiento contends the items sought were necessary to obtain a hearing under Franks. In Franks, the U.S. Supreme Court addressed whether a criminal defendant has the right to challenge the truthfulness of factual statements in an affidavit that supported a search warrant. Id. at 155. The court held as follows: 
There is, of course, a presumption of validity with respect
to the affidavit supporting the search warrant. To mandatean evidentiary hearing, the challenger's attack must be morethan conclusory and must be supported by more than a meredesire to cross-examine. There must be allegations ofdeliberate falsehood or of reckless disregard for the truth,and those allegations must be accompanied by an offer ofproof. They should point out specifically the portion of thewarrant affidavit that is claimed to be false; and theyshould be accompanied by a statement of supporting reasons.Affidavits or sworn or otherwise reliable statements of witnesses should be furnished, or their absencesatisfactorily explained. Allegations of negligence orinnocent mistake are insufficient. The deliberate falsity orreckless disregard whose impeachment is permitted today isonly that of the affiant, not of any nongovernmentalinformant. Finally, if these requirements are met, and if,when material that is the subject of the alleged falsity orreckless disregard is set to one side, there remainssufficient content in the warrant affidavit to support afinding of probable cause, no hearing is required. On the other hand, if the remaining content is insufficient, thedefendant is entitled, under the Fourth and FourteenthAmendments, to his hearing. Whether he will prevail at thathearing is, of course, another issue. 
Id. at 171-72 (footnote omitted). 
Here, Sarmiento's argument on appeal focuses on the 
requests in the Motion to Compel to obtain records of 
disciplinary files or investigations into Lt. Kapua and the alleged misappropriation of money from the controlled buy fund;documents showing serial numbers for the cash used in the controlled purchase from Sarmiento and copies of the money  
13 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
recovered from Sarmiento and Salvas;10 and KPD procedures 
regarding controlled buys, the use of informants for controlled 
buys, and documentation of money used for controlled buys. The crux of Sarmiento's assertion is that obtaining these documents would help establish the need for a Franks hearing to show that a controlled purchase from Sarmiento never happened. 
In addressing the Motion to Compel, the Circuit Court 
conducted an in camera review of the available documents at issue on appeal, except for the documents related to Lt. Kapua. The Circuit Court ruled that the documents need not be disclosed for various reasons including protection of the source's identity, the cash used in the controlled purchase was of marginal value because there was a gap in time between the controlled purchase and when monies were later seized from the defendants, and the court had previously determined that matters related to Lt. Kapua were not relevant to the case. 
Based on our review of the record, the Circuit Court 
properly conducted an in camera review to balance Sarmiento's concerns regarding whether Officer Nesbitt's affidavit was credible and the State's interest in protecting the confidentiality of the source. Moreover, we agree with the Circuit Court that, given the gap in time between the controlled purchase and when funds were seized from Sarmiento, even if the requested documents showed Sarmiento did not have possession of any of the "buy money" when he was arrested, it would not help to show a deliberate falsehood or a reckless disregard for the truth in the affidavit supporting the search warrant to support the need for a Franks hearing. 
10 Defendants asserted the serial numbers of money used in the
controlled purchase were needed because if the numbers did not match money
that was later seized from the defendants, it would corroborate theircontention that a controlled purchase never occurred. The State respondedthat releasing the serial numbers could allow defendants to potentially tracethe identity of the source, and in any event, the money recovered fromdefendants when they were arrested had not been photographed and had beenmingled with other forfeited funds. 
14 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 Sarmiento also argues that the forfeiture and co-
mingling of the money seized from him constitutes destruction of 
evidence. However, as noted above, that evidence would not have helped to establish the showing needed for a Franks hearing. Further, the serial numbers of the cash seized from Sarmiento were not critical to his defense because that evidence is immaterial to whether Sarmiento possessed drugs on July 13, 2012. Any showing that the serial numbers from the controlled buy do not match the serial numbers of cash seized from Sarmiento does not exculpate him. 
Finally, Sarmiento fails to provide any specific 
argument or authority on how KPD policies and procedures on controlled buys were pertinent. Sarmiento does not provide argument about how such records would help to show deliberate falsehood or a reckless disregard for the truth in the affidavit supporting the search warrant, in particular that the controlled purchase from Sarmiento never actually occurred, so that he could establish the need for a Franks hearing. 
We conclude that the Circuit Court did not abuse its 
discretion in denying the Motion to Compel.
D. Motions in Limine 
Sarmiento contends the Circuit Court erred in granting 
in part the State's First Motion in Limine and granting the 
State's Second Motion in Limine. Specifically, Sarmiento argues 
the Circuit Court should have denied the motion with respect to: 
(1) Judge Kathleen Watanabe's Findings of Fact and
Conclusions entered April 10, 2012 in an unrelated case,State v. Sullivan, et al., Cr. No. 10-1-0153 ( Item 2 ); 
(2) any references of alleged other acts of Sergeant Rose(Item 3 ); 
(3) any references of alleged other acts of Officer Nesbitt(Item 5 ); 
(4) cell phone videos from September 28, 2014 wherein KPDofficers stopped Salvas and Sarmiento in their vehicle ( Item 
7); 
(5) references to an alleged 2007 FBI investigation ofpossible misconduct at the KPD, or regarding a particular 
15 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
confidential informant investigated during that
investigation who allegedly planted evidence in suspects'vehicles ( Item 8 ); and 
(6) any references of alleged other acts of Lt. Kapua.(State's Second Motion in Limine ) 
"Because the granting or denying of a motion in limine 
is within the trial court's inherent power to exclude or admit 
evidence, we review the court's ruling for the abuse of discretion standard." State v. Mark, 120 Hawai# i 499, 514, 210 
P.3d 22, 37 (App. 2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
"However, when the trial court's order granting a 
motion in limine is an evidentiary decision based upon a decision that can 'yield only one correct result,' the standard of review is the right/wrong standard. Id. at 514–15, 210 P.3d at 37–38 
(quoting 
Walsh v. Chan, 80 Hawai# i 212, 215, 908 P.2d 1198, 1201 
(1995)); Ass'n of Apt. Owners of Wailea Elua v. Wailea Resort Co., Ltd., 100 Hawai# i 97, 110, 58 P.3d 608, 621 (2002) 
(decisions regarding relevance are reviewed under the right/wrong standard).
1. The Circuit Court Erred in Granting the State's
First Motion in Limine Items 2 and 3 
Sarmiento and Salvas sought to introduce findings from 
the Sullivan case in which Judge Watanabe found Sergeant Rose's 
testimony that contraband was in plain view was contradicted by an unrelated witness. The findings stated that, "Sergeant Rose testified that he knew that if the bag was closed it would have been an illegal search for him to have unzipped the bag and searched it. Accordingly, Sergeant Rose testified that the zipper on the bag was unzipped and that he could see the contents of the bag in plain view." Based on the credible contradicting testimony of a witness who had no stake in the outcome of the case, Judge Watanabe found that Sergeant Rose seized the closed bag from the defendant, struggled with the bag to open it, unzipped the zipper opening the bag, and then searched the bag. 
HRE Rule 608(b) provides: "Specific instances of the 
conduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking the witness' 
16 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
credibility, if probative of untruthfulness, may be inquired into 
on cross-examination of the witness and, in the discretion of the court, may be proved by extrinsic evidence." 
[U]nder the plain language of HRE Rule 608(b), admissibility
of evidence under HRE Rule 608(b) involves a two-stepinquiry: (1) whether the specific conduct evidence profferedfor the purpose of attacking the witness's credibility isprobative of untruthfulness, and, if so, (2) whether theprobative value of the evidence of the specific conduct issubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or byconsiderations of undue delay, waste of time, or needlesspresentation of cumulative evidence pursuant to HRE Rule403. 
State v. Su, 147 Hawai# i 272, 283, 465 P.3d 719, 730 (2020) 
(emphasis added). 
In Su, the district court prohibited the defense from 
attacking the arresting officer's credibility by questioning him 
regarding three instances of conduct, including his admission in another case that he had submitted a sworn false statement to the Administrative Driver's License Revocation Office. Id. The 
supreme court noted that the district court stopped at step one of the HRE 608(b) analysis when it concluded that the three instances of conduct were not relevant or probative as to the testifying officer's truthfulness. Id. at 284, 465 P.3d at 731. 
The court found such error could not be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because "the outcome of Su's trial hinged upon the credibility of the two [Honolulu Police Department] witnesses against him." Id. at 285, 465 P.3d at 732. "[T]he finder of 
fact 'should possess all relevant evidence' concerning the falsifications, and that it was "'for the [finder of fact] to decide how much weight to give the falsifications.'" Id. at 
284, 465 P.3d at 731 (quoting State v. Estrada, 69 Haw. 204, 219, 738 P.2d 812, 823 (1987) (brackets omitted)). The supreme court held that on remand, Su was entitled to cross-examine the officer regarding his testimony in two earlier cases, but the extent of the cross-examination, as well as the admissibility of extrinsic evidence, if offered, would be subject to HRE Rule 403. Id.
17 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Here, the Circuit Court did not explain why it excluded 
questioning related to the Sullivan proceedings, beyond saying it 
was not bound by Judge Watanabe's findings in that case. However, the directly contradictory witness testimony in the Sullivan proceedings was relevant to Officer Rose's credibility and probative of untruthfulness. Moreover, Officer Rose's testimony in this case and the evidence he recovered are material to the charges against Sarmiento. We thus conclude that pursuant to HRE Rule 608(b) and Su, Sarmiento is entitled to cross-examine Officer Rose regarding the Sullivan proceedings. Su, 147 Hawai# i 
at 285, 465 P.3d at 732. 
As in Su
, however, "[t]he extent of the 
cross-examination, as well as the admissibility of extrinsic evidence, if offered, is subject to an HRE Rule 403 analysis." Id. at 283, 285, 465 P.3d at 730, 732; see also Salvas, 2021 WL 276150 at *8. 
2. The Circuit Court did not err in precluding
questioning of Officer Nesbitt regarding his OVUIIcharge (Item 5), the cell phone videos (Item 7),the 2007 FBI investigation (Item 8), or the actsof Lt. Kapua (Second Motion in Limine) 
"For the purpose of attacking the credibility of a 
witness, evidence that the witness has been convicted of a crime 
is inadmissible except when the crime is one involving dishonesty." HRE Rule 609. For impeachment purposes, an opposing party may admit proof of only "the class of crimes involving dishonesty, false statement, or perjury." State v. 
Pacheco, 96 Hawai# i 83, 99, 26 P.3d 572, 588 (2001) (brackets, 
quotation marks and citation omitted). 
"[A] prior conviction may 
come in if, but only if, the trial judge, in his [or her] discretion, feels that the party offering the evidence has satisfactorily shown that the conviction to be proved rationally carries probative value on the issue of the truth and veracity of the witness." State v. Estrada, No. CAAP-18-0000521, 2020 WL 
3027400 at *2 (Haw. App. June 5, 2020) (SDO) (quoting 
Asato v. 
Furtado, 52 Haw. 284, 293, 474 P.2d 288, 295 (1970)) (interpreting prior version of rule). Operating a vehicle under 
18 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII) is not a crime involving 
dishonesty. See Asato, 52 Haw. at 293, 295, 474 P.2d at 295–96 
("conviction for heedless and careless driving bears no relation 
to a witness' credibility"). Therefore, the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that the OVUII conviction was not probative on the issue of Officer Nesbitt's truthfulness. 
Sarmiento claims that the Circuit Court erred when it 
did not allow him to introduce cell phone video taken by the defendants on September 28, 2014, which they allege show that KPD officers stopped their car, falsely claimed to have a warrant for one or both of them, and accused them of having contraband visible in the back seat. However, the video footage is not part of the record on appeal and the defendants do not identify which KPD officers were involved in the incident or which officer-witnesses they should have been allowed to confront. See Salvas, 
No. CAAP-18-0000121, 2021 WL 276150 at *9. Thus, this argument lacks merit. 
Next, notwithstanding Sarmiento's contention that a 
2007 FBI investigation of KPD's drug buy informants is relevant and probative to this case involving a controlled buy in 2012, he provides minimal and conclusory argument. In short, Sarmiento fails to establish any relevance of this evidence to this case, and thus the Circuit Court did not err in granting the State's motion in limine in this regard. 
Finally, as discussed above, Sarmiento fails to 
establish that Lt. Kapua's indictment was relevant to this case or pertinent to the discovery of contraband in the Dodge. Moreover, because Lt. Kapua did not testify at trial, Sarmiento was not deprived of his right to cross-examine Lt. Kapua. See 
also Salvas, 2021 WL 276150 at *10. 
Thus, the Circuit Court did not err in granting the 
State's First Motion in Limine Items 5, 7, and 8, and the State's Second Motion in Limine. 
19 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
E. June 10, 2014 Hearing 
Sarmiento's sixth point on appeal is that the Circuit 
Court denied him due process and abused its discretion when it 
did not allow his counsel, Myles Breiner, the opportunity "to cross-examine relevant witnesses at key evidentiary hearings." (capitalization altered). Based on the citations given to where the error was allegedly made and objected to, it appears that Sarmiento is challenging the Circuit Court's refusal to allow Breiner to cross-examine Officer Caspillo regarding Salvas's statement made at the KPD headquarters. Salvas's statement was suppressed. The State argues any error, therefore, was harmless. 
Sarmiento contends he was prejudiced because "we don't 
know what other evidence may have been adduced on cross – possibly evidence negating Sarmiento's statement." This argument fails, however, because Sarmiento does not point to any part of Salvas's statements, if admitted, that would have negated his own statement to police, and moreover, Sarmiento's argument is wholly speculative. We thus conclude there was no error. 
F. August 4, 2016 Hearing 
Sarmiento's seventh point on appeal alleges that he was 
denied the opportunity to argue during the August 4, 2016 hearing on the motions in limine.  At that hearing, Sarmiento's counsel, Breiner, appeared by phone and another attorney, appearing specially for the purpose of the hearing, was in the courtroom. The court told stand-in counsel that if Breiner wanted to make argument he would need to appear. No objection was made. Errors to which no objection is made before the trial court are typically deemed waived, except that the appellate court may notice plain error affecting substantial rights. State v. 
Miller, 122 Hawai# i 92, 100, 223 P.3d 157, 165 (2010). 
HRPP Rule 58 allows the court to allow counsel to 
appear by telephone or other electronic means for any pretrial or status conference, but also provides that "[i]f, at any time during a conference, hearing or proceeding conducted by telephone or other electronic means, the court determines personal 
20 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appearance is necessary, the court may continue the matter and 
require a personal appearance." HRPP Rule 58. Moreover, trial courts have inherent judicial power to require a party to appear in person for a hearing. See Tamman v. Tamman, No. 
CAAP–13–0000109, 2015 WL 9594740 at *4 (Haw. App. Dec. 31, 2015) (mem. op.); Stump v. Stump, No. CAAP-12-0001056, 2014 WL 1744081 at *7 (Haw. App. April 30, 2014) (mem. op.) (quoting State v. Sakamoto, 101 Hawai# i 409, 415, 70 P.3d 635, 641 (2003) (Acoba, 
J., concurring) ("courts have inherent equity, supervisory, and administrative powers as well as inherent power to control the litigation process before them"). "Affording trial courts discretion in this regard . . . reflects cognizance on the part of appellate courts about the real concerns that trial courts may have over the use of telephonic testimony or appearances that are not pre-planned and subject to reasonable limitations and/or protections." Stump, 2014 WL 1744081 at *7. 
Given the wide discretion to control the courtroom and 
the on-the-record acknowledgment of the court's prohibition regarding arguments by phone, the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in refusing Sarmiento's counsel from arguing over the phone. Cf. Stomber v. Stomber, No. 29064, 2009 WL 2625237 at *2 
(Haw. App. Aug. 27, 2009) (SDO) (abuse of discretion where, on day of hearing, family court reversed its earlier decision that husband/father could appear by phone).
G. The charges for Possession of a Dangerous Drug were
sufficient 
Sarmiento's final point of error is that the Circuit 
Court "lacked jurisdiction" over Counts 1 and 3, Possession of a 
Dangerous Drug, because the felony information document was deficient for not alleging constructive possession under HRS § 712-1251 (
2014).11 We first note that a "flawed [charging] 
11 HRS 712-1251 provides: 
§712-1251 Possession in a motor vehicle; prima facie
evidence. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2), the
(continued...) 
21 11(...continued)NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
instrument does not abrogate the jurisdiction of the court, which 
is established by statute and invoked by a charge of a cognizable offense prescribed by law." Schwartz v. State, 136 Hawai# i 258, 
272, 361 P.3d 1161, 1175 (2015). 
We read Sarmiento's final point on appeal as 
challenging the sufficiency of the charges. Based on our review of the Felony Information And Non-Felony Complaint filed on December 4, 2013, as well as the information provided to Sarmiento before he challenged the felony information toward the end of trial, we conclude the charges for Counts 1 and 3 are sufficient. 
Whether the charge is stated orally or in a written 
information, indictment, or complaint, it "must sufficiently allege all of the essential elements of the offense charged[.]" State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai# i 383, 391, 219 P.3d 1170, 1178 
(2009) (quoting State v. Jendrusch, 58 Haw. 279, 281, 567 P.2d 1242, 1244 (1977)). The sufficiency of the charging instrument is determined, among other things, by "whether it contains the elements of the offense intended to be charged, and sufficiently apprises the defendant of what he or she must be prepared to meet." Id. (quoting State v. Wells, 78 Hawai# i 373, 379-80, 894 
P.2d 80, 76-77 (1995)) (brackets omitted). "A charge defective in this regard amounts to a failure to state an offense, and a 
presence of a dangerous drug, harmful drug, or detrimental
drug in a motor vehicle, other than a public omnibus, isprima facie evidence of knowing possession thereof by eachand every person in the vehicle at the time the drug wasfound. 
(2) Subsection (1) does not apply to:
(a) Other occupants of the motor vehicle if thesubstance is found upon the person of one of theoccupants therein;
(b) All occupants, except the driver or owner of themotor vehicle, if the substance is found in someportion of the vehicle normally accessible onlyto the driver or owner; or
(c) The driver of a motor vehicle who is at the time operating it for hire in the pursuit of thedriver's trade, if the substance is found in apart of the vehicle used or occupied bypassengers. 
22 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
conviction based upon it cannot be sustained, for that would 
constitute a denial of due process." Id. (quoting Jendrusch, 58 
Haw. at 281, 567 P.2d at 1240). 
"In general, where the statute sets forth with 
reasonable clarity all essential elements of the crime intended to be punished, and fully defines the offense in unmistakable terms readily comprehensible to persons of common understanding, a charge drawn in the language of the statute is sufficient." Wheeler, 121 Hawai# i at 393, 219 P.3d at 1180 (internal 
quotations, brackets and citations omitted). In determining whether a charge meets constitutional requirements, we must examine "whether the language actually used in the charge provides fair notice to the defendant." Id.
 at 394, 219 P.3d at 
1181; see also State v. Kauhane
, 145 Hawai# i 362, 369-70, 452 
P.3d 359, 366-67 (2019) ("When a criminal defendant challenges the sufficiency of a charge in a timely manner, an appellate court will uphold that charge if: (1) it contains the elements of the offense; and (2) it sufficiently apprises the defendant of what the defendant must be prepared to meet."). 
Furthermore, "in determining whether the accused's 
right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him or her has been violated, we must look to all of the information supplied to him or her by the State to the point where the court passes upon the contention that the right has been violated." State v. Hitchcock, 123 Hawai# i 369, 379, 235 
P.3d 365, 375 (2010) (brackets and citations omitted). 
Here, on July 20, 2017, after the State had rested its 
case, Sarmiento orally moved for judgment of acquittal based, inter alia, on the assertion that there was insufficient evidence on the issue of possession. The Circuit Court stated that, with regard to the issue of possession, it would rely on HRS § 712-1251, possession within a vehicle. At this point, Sarmiento's counsel argued that the State had not given notice that it would rely on HRS § 712-1251 and should have given notice in the original pleading documents. The Circuit Court denied 
23  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Sarmiento's motion for judgment of acquittal based on HRS § 712-
1251. 
Counts 1 and 3 in the felony information charge 
Sarmiento with possession of methamphetamine, in any amount, setting out the elements of the offense and tracking the language in HRS § 712-1243.
12 Sarmiento argues this situation is akin to 
Wheeler and State v. Nesmith, 127 Hawai# i 48, 276 P.3d 617 
(2012), asserting that "the definitions of the charges were more narrowly defined than what the general public would assume via common knowledge and general usage." Sarmiento contends the charges should have alleged possession of a dangerous drug "either actually or constructively per HRS § 712-1251[.]" 
We reject Sarmiento's arguments because the record 
shows that, in addition to Counts 1 and 3 following the language of the statute, the State provided information that informed Sarmiento of the nature and cause of the accusation against him in these charges, which was done before he challenged the sufficiency of the charges. 
Exhibits to the felony information 
include an affidavit by Officer Nesbitt, who was involved with executing the search warrant and the recovery of evidence from the vehicle, and he attests to the items recovered in the vehicle search, including items containing a substance resembling crystal methamphetamine. On July 18, 2017, prior to Sarmiento's challenge to the charge, the State presented its opening statements, asserting that among the evidence recovered from the subject vehicle were methamphetamine packets from the passenger door, that an expert witness who conducted lab testing would 
12 The indictment reads, in relevant part: 
COUNT 1: On or about the 13th day of July, 2012, in
the County of Kauai, State of Hawaii, CORY SARMIENTOdid knowingly possess the dangerous drugmethamphetamine, in any amount, thereby committing theoffense of Promoting a Dangerous Drug in the ThirdDegree, in violation of Section 712-1243 of the HawaiiRevised Statutes. 
Count 3 is identical to Count 1. 
24 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
testify that two packets sent to her contained methamphetamine, 
and the State further argued regarding the various items recovered that it would "present to [the jury] that this evidence does prove knowingly and state of mind possession[.]" Later that day, the State entered into evidence photos taken during the search of the vehicle, including photos of items that contained methamphetamine. Officer Nesbitt also testified as to where these items had been found in the vehicle. Taken together, this information provided notice to Sarmiento that the State alleged particular items containing methamphetamine found in the subject vehicle were in his possession. 
Given the record and the allegations in Counts 1 and 3, 
the charges were sufficient.
III. Conclusion 
Based on our determination that Sarmiento was 
improperly precluded from cross-examining Officer Rose regarding 
the Sullivan proceeding, the Judgment is vacated and this case is remanded for a new trial.
