APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 14-1-0603(1)) 
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Nakasone, JJ.)  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Defendant-Appellant Elizabeth Braxton Burke 
(Elizabeth)1 appeals from the Judgment entered on March 7, 2018, 
in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (Circuit Court).2 
Elizabeth also challenges the Circuit Court's March 7, 2018 
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law; Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and for Interlocutory 
Decree of Foreclosure (Foreclosure Decree) entered in favor of 
Plaintiff-Appellee Christiana Trust, a Division of Wilmington 
Savings Fund Society, FSB, Not in Its Individual Capacity but as 
Trustee of ARLP Trust 3 (Christiana Trust) and against Elizabeth 
and Michael (collectively, the Burkes) and other defendants. 
Elizabeth raises several points of error on appeal, 
including her contention that Christiana Trust did not establish 
that it had standing to file the complaint in this foreclosure action. On appeal, Christiana Trust acknowledges and agrees thatunder the evidentiary standards articulated by the 
Hawai#i  
1 Elizabeth purported to file the March 15, 2018 Notice of Appeal on
behalf of both herself and Defendant T. Michael Burke ( Michael). Elizabeth,
who was self-represented at the time, is not licensed to practice law in
Hawai #i. Under Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) §§ 605-2 and 605-14 (2016), non-
attorneys "are not permitted to act as 'attorneys' and represent other natural
persons in their causes." Oahu Plumbing & Sheet Metal, Ltd. v. Kona Constr.,
Inc., 60 Haw. 372, 377, 590 P.2d 570, 573 (1979); see, e.g., Fernandes v.Hashimoto, CAAP-20-0000128, 2020 WL 3125334, *1 n.1 (Haw. App. June 12, 2020)(Order). While "submissions of self-represented litigants should beinterpreted liberally," and counsel later appeared to represent the Burkes onthis appeal, "the right of self-representation is not a license not to complywith the relevant rules of procedural and substantive law." Estate Admin. 
Servs. LLC v. Mohulamu, 148 Hawai #i 10, 18, 466 P.3d 408, 418 (2020)
(citations, ellipsis, and internal quotation marks omitted). 
Thus, Elizabeth
is the sole appellant. In light of our disposition, however, it appears thatthe relief granted on this appeal is not affected by the fact that Elizabethis the only appellant.

Supreme Court, Christiana Trust did not meet the applicable 
evidentiary standards and requirements to establish its standing, as set forth in Bank of Am., N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai# i 
361, 390 P.3d 1248 (2017); U.S. Bank N.A. v. Mattos, 140 Hawai# i 
26, 398 P.3d 615 (2017); Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Behrendt, 142 Hawai#i 37, 414 P.3d 89 (2018). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve Elizabeth's appeal as follows: 
We conclude that Christiana Trust failed to properly 
submit admissible evidence demonstrating that it was entitled to enforce the subject note at the time the foreclosure complaint was filed. Thus, the Circuit Court erred in its entry of the Foreclosure Decree and Judgment in favor of Christiana Trust. See also U.S. Bank Tr., N.A. v. Verhagen, 149 Hawai# i 315, 327-
28, 489 P.3d 419, 431-32 (2021); Deutsche Bank Nat'l Tr. v. Yata, 152 Hawai# i 322, 335-36, 526 P.3d 299, 312-13 (2023) (recent 
supreme court cases further clarifying the cases cited by the parties). 
Accordingly, the March 7, 2018 Foreclosure Decree and 
Judgment are vacated, and this case is remanded to the Circuit

Court for further proceedings. All pending motions are hereby 
dismissed as moot.
