APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 13-1-0741(1))
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Chan, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Lewanna Godinez (Godinez ) appeals
from the March 8, 2018 Order Denying [Godinez's] Rule 60(b)
Motion for Relief from Judgment ( Order Denying Relief), which was
entered by the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit ( Circuit
Court).1
1The Honorable Rhonda I.L. Loo presided.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
In lieu of stating points of error arising from the
Circuit Court's entry of the Order Denying Relief, Godinez
asserts that the Circuit Court erred in its Findings of Fact,
Conclusions of Law and Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for
Summary Judgment for Foreclosure Against All Defendants and for
Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure (Foreclosure Decree ) and
Judgment, both entered on November 24, 2017, because there were
genuine issues of material fact and evidentiary infirmities with
respect to Plaintiff-Appellee PennyMac Corp.'s (PennyMac's)
standing, which precluded summary judgment against Godinez and in
favor of PennyMac.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve Godinez's "points of error" as follows:
The Circuit Court entered the Foreclosure Decree and
Judgment on November 24, 2017.  No timely appeal was filed from
the Foreclosure Decree and Judgment.  Godinez's failure to appeal
from the Foreclosure Decree and Judgment bars Godinez from now
challenging PennyMac's standing under the doctrine of res
judicata .  See Mortg. Elec. Registration Sys., Inc. v. Wise, 130
Hawai#i 11, 17, 304 P.3d 1192, 1198 (2013).  
Godinez makes no discernible argument on appeal as to
whether the Circuit Court abused its discretion in entering the
Order Denying Relief, which addressed Godinez's motion for relief
made pursuant to Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule
60(b).  Instead, Godinez argues that the Circuit Court erred in
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
entering the Foreclosure Decree and Judgment because PennyMac
lacked standing pursuant to Bank of Am., N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo,
139 Hawai#i 361, 390 P.3d 1248 (2017), and U.S. Bank N.A. v.
Mattos, 140 Hawai# i 26, 398 P.3d 615 (2017).  In the Reply Brief,
for example, Godinez emphasizes that "the one question on appeal
is standing, not discretion."  Godinez argues that the issue of
standing is jurisdictional, jurisdictional requirements always
remain open for review, and therefore the doctrine of res
judicata  should not be applied here. 
Lack of standing does not render a court's judgment
void under HRCP Rule 60(b).  "In the sound interest of finality,
the concept of a void judgment must be narrowly restricted."
Cvitanovich-Dubie v. Dubie, 125 Hawai# i 128, 141, 254 P.3d 439,
452 (2011) (citations omitted).  It is well-recognized that "a
judgment is void only if the court that rendered it lacked
jurisdiction of either the subject matter or the parties or
otherwise acted in a manner inconsistent with due process of
law."  Id. at 139, 254 P.3d at 450 (citation omitted).  Here,
there is no challenge based on personal jurisdiction, and an
argument that a party lacks standing is not equivalent to
challenging a court's subject matter jurisdiction.  As the
Hawai#i Supreme Court recently reaffirmed, "[i]n Hawai# i state
courts, standing is a prudential consideration . . . and is not
an issue of subject matter jurisdiction."  Tax Found. of Hawai# i
v. State, 144 Hawai#i 175, 188, 439 P.3d 127, 140 (2019).  
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
In sum, we conclude that the Circuit Court did not err
in entering the Order Denying Relief.  Therefore, the Circuit
Court's March 8, 2018 Order Denying Relief is affirmed.
