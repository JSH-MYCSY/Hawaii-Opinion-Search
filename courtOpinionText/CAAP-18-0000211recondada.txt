DL, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
CL, Defendant-Appellee
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(FC-D NO. 16-1-1014)
ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Chan, JJ.)
Upon consideration of Plaintiff-Appellant DL's (DL's )
Motion for Reconsideration filed on March 11, 2019 ( Motion), and
the records and files in this case, we conclude that the Motion
is without merit.
DL argues that this court erred in noting, at the
beginning of its Summary Disposition Order, that his appeal was
from an April 26, 2018 Divorce Decree, rather than, as DL
submits, from a March 16, 2018 First Amended Order Re:
Evidentiary Hearing (Amended Order ).  The court did not
misapprehend or fail to address DL's arguments regarding, inter
alia, the Amended Order.  The reference to the Divorce Decree
was, in the first instance, for the purpose of referencing theNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
order or judgment that was final and appealable; the Amended
Order did not enter a decree of dissolution of the parties'
marriage, a decree of dissolution had not been previously
entered, and the Amended Order was not separately final and
appealable.  See Eaton v. Eaton, 7 Haw. App. 111, 118-19, 748
P.2d 801, 805 (1987).
Upon careful review, we conclude that this court did
not misapprehend or overlook any of the factual or legal issues
raised in the Motion.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is
denied.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai #i, March 15, 2019.
