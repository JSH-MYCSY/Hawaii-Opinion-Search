1 The Honorable Randal G.B. Valenciano presided.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
57, 428 P.3d 761, 768-69 (2018). A complaint should not be 
dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts supporting their claim that would entitle them to relief. Id. at 257, 428 P.3d at 769. We view the factual allegations in the complaint in a light most favorable to the plaintiff to determine whether they could warrant relief under any legal theory .
2 Id. 
Wolf is the personal representative of the estate of 
her late mother, Beverly H. Wolf. The second amended complaint 
alleged that Beverly used Henry J. Heis and his company, Grunewald Equity Funding, Inc. (together, Heis) to broker loans — 
with Beverly as the lender — secured by mortgages on real property in Hawai #i. When a loan became due or the real property 
securing it was sold, an escrow was opened to process payments and documentation. In at least three transactions the escrow — 
either FATCO or Nextitle — paid the loan proceeds to Heis, even though it was instructed to pay Beverly. 
Beverly "lost money 
[that was] due to her." 
FATCO and Nextitle both cite DeMello v. Home Escrow, 
Inc., 4 Haw. App. 41, 659 P.2d 759 (1983), and argue they owed no legal duty to Beverly because she was not a party to the escrow agreements. We held in 
DeMello that the defendant escrow company 
owed no fiduciary  duty to the plaintiff, who was not a signatory 
to the escrow agreement. Id. at 47, 659 P.2d at 763. Viewing 
the allegations in the second amended complaint in the light most favorable to Wolf, Beverly was an intended third-party beneficiary of the escrow agreements. Ass'n of Apt. Owners of 
Newtown Meadows v. Venture 15, Inc., 115 Hawai #i 232, 269–70, 167 
P.3d 225, 262–63 (2007); see Hough v. Pac. Ins. Co. , 83 Hawai #i 
457, 468, 927 P.2d 858, 869 (1996) (holding that insurer owed contractual duties to employer's employee as intended third-party beneficiary of employer's workers compensation policy). 
2 Hawai#i is a notice-pleading jurisdiction where it is "not
necessary to plead legal theories with precision." Reyes-Toledo , 143 Hawai# i 
at 259, 428 P.3d at 771 (cleaned up). 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
As to Nextitle, we must assume this allegation to be 
true for purposes of its motion to dismiss because none of 
Nextitle's escrow instructions were attached to the second amended complaint.
3 
FATCO's escrow agreement (Exhibit 5 to the second 
amended complaint) contains the instruction "All proceeds to be sent to 1
st lien holder [sic]" in handwriting. On this record, 
the circuit court erred by granting the motions to dismiss because the second amended complaint stated an intended-third-party-beneficiary claim for breach of contract. 
FATCO and Nextitle both argue that Wolf's claims are 
time-barred under Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 657-7 (two 
years for damage to persons or property). But the six-year limitation period under HRS § 657-1 (2016) applies to Wolf's claims based on Beverly being an intended third-party beneficiary of the escrow agreements. That period began to run when Beverly's cause of action accrued. Beverly's intended-third-party-beneficiary claim for breach of contract accrued when she knew or should have discovered that the defendant breached the contract — the escrow agreement. Blair v. Ing , 95 Hawai #i 247, 
264, 21 P.3d 452, 469 (2001). 
When that was for each escrow 
agreement at issue is a question of fact that could not have been resolved on a motion to dismiss. See Newtown Meadows , 115 
Hawai#i at 277, 167 P.3d at 270. 
For these reasons, the July 17, 2017 "Order Granting 
Defendant First American Title Company, Inc.'s Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint[,]" the July 28, 2017 "Order Granting Defendant First Hawaii Title Corporation dba Nextitle's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint[,]" and 
3 Wolf's memorandum in opposition to Nextitle's motion to dismiss
included an exhibit that appears to be escrow instructions. The record (which
does not include the transcript of the hearing on Nextitle's motion) does notindicate whether the circuit court excluded the exhibit or considered it,which would have converted the motion to dismiss into a motion for summaryjudgment. See
 Hawai#i Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 12(b). We do not 
consider the exhibit and express no opinion about its contents, or lackthereof.

the "Final Judgment" entered on March 12, 2018, are vacated, and 
this case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this summary disposition order.
