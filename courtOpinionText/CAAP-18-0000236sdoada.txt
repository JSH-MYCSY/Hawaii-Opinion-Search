Mortgage LLC (Nationstar) and Federal National Mortgage 
Association (Fannie Mae): 1) by concluding the wrongful 
foreclosure claim was barred by either the two-year statute of 
limitations under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 657-7 (2016)2 
or the six-year statute of limitations under HRS § 657-1(4) (2016);
3 2) by concluding that the time for Guyer to file the 
wrongful foreclosure claim was triggered on September 28, 2010 or, at the latest, on November 29, 2010; and 3) because a twenty-year statute of limitations under HRS § 657-31 (2016)
4 applied to 
his claim to recover possession of the property at issue or equitable damages. 
I. Brief Background 
After Guyer was assigned a leasehold interest in an 
apartment located in Lahaina, Maui (Property), he executed a note 
and mortgage (Mortgage) in connection with the Property, granting 
the mortgagee a power of sale. The Mortgage was later assigned 
to Nationstar. In 2010, Nationstar exercised its power of sale 
and purchased the Property at public auction. The parties do not dispute that on March 30, 2011, Nationstar assigned the leasehold interest in the Property to Fannie Mae, and that nearly a year later, Fannie Mae assigned the leasehold interest to Travis Bontorin (Bontorin). 
2 HRS § 657-7 provides that: "[a]ctions for the recovery of
compensation for damage or injury to persons or property shall be instituted
within two years after the cause of action accrued, and not after, except asprovided in section 657-13." 
3 HRS § 657-1 provides, in pertinent part: 
§ 657-1 Six years . The following actions shall be commenced within
six years next after the cause of action accrued, and not after: 
. . . . 
(4)
 Personal actions of any nature whatsoever not specifically
covered by the laws of the State. 
4 HRS § 657-31 provides: "No person shall commence an action to recover
possession of any lands, or make any entry thereon, unless within twenty yearsafter the right to bring the action first accrued." 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On December 28, 2016, Guyer initiated this action in 
the Circuit Court. Guyer asserted two counts against both 
Nationstar and Fannie Mae: 1) return of title and possession of property (Count I) and 2) wrongful foreclosure (Count II). 
In Count I, Guyer alleged, inter alia, that the 
assignment by Nationstar to Fannie Mae "unlawfully deprived [him] of the title, possession, and use" of the Property and was void under prior cases, not simply voidable, because Nationstar, as the foreclosing mortgagee, violated multiple provisions of the power of sale in the Mortgage and nonjudicial foreclosure statute regarding notice. Guyer also asserted he had twenty years to bring a claim of title to or possession of the Property under HRS § 657-31. Further, Guyer alleged that because the assignment from Nationstar to Fannie Mae was void, the assignment from Fannie Mae to Bontorin was likewise void and if title could not be restored to Guyer then he would be entitled to damages. 
In Count II, Guyer alleged, inter alia, that the 
improper foreclosure and further assignment of the Property to Bontorin were part of a continuing tort against Guyer and fell within the six-year statute of limitations under HRS § 657-1(4) as measured from the date title or possession of the Property was lost; thus, Nationstar and Fannie Mae were liable to him for damages. 
Nationstar and Fannie Mae asserted several defenses in 
response to the Complaint, including that the Complaint was barred by the applicable statute of limitations. 
On July 25, 2017, Nationstar and Fannie Mae jointly 
filed a motion for summary judgment (MSJ), supported by a 
declaration of counsel and exhibits. Nationstar and Fannie Mae 
argued that for an actionable claim, a plaintiff only needs factual knowledge of the necessary elements. Thus, Guyer's claims accrued on September 28, 2010, when Nationstar recorded the "Notice of Mortgagee's Intention to Foreclose Under Power of Sale" (Notice of Sale) or, at the latest, on November 29, 2010, 
the date the Notice of Sale stated the foreclosure sale would 
take place but which actually occurred on December 28, 2010. 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The MSJ further argued that the two-year statute of 
limitations applied to tort claims and thus the wrongful 
foreclosure claim was barred. The MSJ also argued Guyer's claims were barred by the six-year statute of limitations when calculating accrual from either September 28, 2010, or November 29, 2010. 
Regarding Guyer's complaint allegation that a twenty-
year statute of limitations applies to his claim for recovery of title and possession, Nationstar and Fannie Mae argue the twenty-year statute of limitations under HRS § 657-31 only applies to adverse possession cases, and not wrongful foreclosure cases. 
In opposition to Nationstar and Fannie Mae's MSJ, Guyer 
argued that: 1) his claim for wrongful foreclosure was subject to at least the six-year statute of limitations because it pertained to an intangible and nonphysical injury to property; 2) the wrongful foreclosure claim accrued at earliest on January 10, 2011, when the "Mortgagee's Affidavit of Foreclosure Under Power of Sale" (Foreclosure Affidavit) was recorded; and 3) the twenty-
year statute of limitations applies to real actions against the 
land, including foreclosures claiming recovery of title and possession. 
On August 17, 2017, the Circuit Court held a hearing on
the MSJ. In the hearing, the Circuit Court ruled as follows:  
THE COURT: . . . The Court having had an
opportunity to review the motion, the opposition, and the
reply, the Court's going to grant Defendants' motion forsummary judgment. 
The wrongful foreclosure claim accrued, at
the latest, at the time of the auction on December 28, 2010but more likely September 28, 2010, the notice of sale. Thecomplaint was filed six years after the alleged improperforeclosure sale. 
As pled, Plaintiff's claim sounds solely in
tort; therefore, Plaintiff's wrongful foreclosure claim isbarred by the two-year statute of limitations pursuant toHRS 657-7. 
Even if the two-year limitations does not
apply, the six-year statute of limitations under HRS 657-11[sic] would bar Plaintiff's claims as well.

Therefore, the Court's going to grant
Defendants' motion for summary judgment, ask Ms. Ching to
prepare the order on the matter. 
MS. CHING: Thank you, Judge. 
Could I have a clarification? Our argument
was notice of sale, which was - - I just want to make sure I
have the dates correct for accrual - - September 28th, 2010or, at the latest, the date of the auction that did notoccur, which was November 29, 2010. 
THE COURT: Correct. Sorry. Thank you for
clarifying that for me. 
The Order Granting MSJ and Final Judgment were entered 
thereafter. 
II. Standard of Review 
We review the grant or denial of summary judgment de 
novo. See First Ins. Co. of Hawaii, Ltd. v. A & B Props., Inc., 
126 Hawai# i 406, 413, 271 P.3d 1165, 1172 (2012) (citation 
omitted). It is well-established that: 
[S]ummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions onfile, together with the affidavits, if any, show that thereis no genuine issue as to any material fact and that themoving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Afact is material if proof of that fact would have the effectof establishing or refuting one of the essential elements ofa cause of action or defense asserted by the parties. Theevidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to thenon-moving party. In other words, we must view all of theevidence and inferences drawn therefrom in the light mostfavorable to the party opposing the motion. 
Id. at 413-14, 271 P.3d at 1172-73 (citation omitted) (brackets 
in original). 
III. Discussion 
A.  Applicable Statute of Limitations 
Guyer first contends the Circuit Court erred in 
granting Nationstar and Fannie Mae's MSJ by concluding that the wrongful foreclosure claim was barred by either the two-year statute of limitations under HRS § 657-7 or the six-year statute of limitations under HRS § 657-1(4). 
Guyer argues that his wrongful foreclosure claim is 
subject to at least a six-year statute of limitations under HRS § 657-1(4) rather than the two-year statute of limitations under 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRS § 657-7, because HRS § 657-7 does n  ot govern a claim for 
wrongful foreclosure. 
Nationstar and Fannie Mae argue that the two-year 
statute of limitations under HRS § 657-7 applies here because it 
concerns compensation for "injury to persons or property" and Guyer "seeks to recover monetary damages resulting from his loss of possession and use of the Property." 
In Delapinia v. Nationstar Mortgage LLC, 146 Hawai# i 
218, 224, 458 P.3d 929, 935 (App. 2020), affirmed in part, vacated in part, 150 Hawai# i 91, 497 P.3d 106 (2021) (Delapinia
II), this court observed that: 
[t]he supreme court has interpreted HRS § 657-7 "to apply to
'claims for damages resulting from physical injury topersons or physical injury to tangible interests inproperty.'" Gomez[ v. Am. Airlines, Inc., 111 Hawai #i 67,
70, 137 P.3d 381, 384 (2006)] (emphasis in original)(quoting Au[ v. Au, 63 Haw. 210, 216, 626 P.2d 173, 178(1981)]). On the other hand, the supreme court has appliedHRS § 657-1 to claims concerning a non-physical injury to anintangible interest of the plaintiff. Higa v. Mirikitani, 55Haw. 167, 170-73, 517 P.2d 1, 4-6 (1973) (applying thesix-year statute of limitations of HRS § 657-1(1) to a legalmalpractice claim involving non-physical injury to anintangible interest). 
Id. at 225, 458 P.3d at 936 (footnote omitted) (emphasis in 
original). There, plaintiffs did not allege any physical harm to the subject property and instead asserted that the defendants had wrongfully deprived them of title to and possession of the subject property. Id. (citations omitted). Therefore, as a nonphysical injury to their intangible interests, this court concluded that the plaintiffs' wrongful foreclosure claim was subject to the six-year statute of limitations under HRS § 657-1(4). Id. 
Here, as in Delapinia, Guyer did not allege any 
physical harm to the Property. Instead, Guyer claims Nationstar and Fannie Mae caused a nonphysical injury to his intangible interest by wrongfully "depriv[ing him] of his possession, record title, and use of the Property[.]" Thus, the six-year statute of limitations under HRS § 657-1(4) governs Guyer's claim for wrongful foreclosure. 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
B. Trigger for Limitations Period 
Guyer next contends the Circuit Court erred in 
determining that the limitations period to file the wrongful 
foreclosure claim was triggered on September 28, 2010 or, at the latest, on November 29, 2010. Guyer contends that for wrongful foreclosure claims, the statute of limitations is triggered when a plaintiff has a cause of action for damages, i.e., when the foreclosure occurs "causing either a loss of title or possession or both." According to Guyer, this does not occur until both a foreclosure affidavit and a deed are recorded. Guyer further argues that because the discovery rule applies to wrongful foreclosure claims, the statute of limitations began to run at the earliest when the Foreclosure Affidavit was recorded on January 10, 2011, giving him notice of the foreclosure. 
Nationstar and Fannie Mae argue that instead of the 
discovery rule, the relevant inquiry "is what the plaintiff might 'have known by the use of the means of information within his reach, with the vigilance the law requires of him[.]'" (Citing Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Newtown Meadows ex rel. Bd. of Dirs. v. Venture 15, Inc., 115 Hawai# i 232, 277-78, 167 P.3d 225, 
270-71 (2007), as corrected (Sept. 20, 2007)). Thus, Nationstar and Fannie Mae argue the Circuit Court did not err because Guyer's claim for money damages accrued when the Notice of Sale was recorded and served on Guyer on September 28, 2010, considering the Notice of Sale provided him with the "information necessary to assert a claim of wrongful foreclosure." 
As discussed in Delapinia, "[u]nder Hawaii's discovery 
rule, the statute of limitations begins to run when the plaintiff 'discovers or should have discovered the negligent act, the damage, and the causal connection between the former and the latter.'" 146 Hawai# i at 226, 458 P.3d at 937 (quoting Thomas v. 
Kidani, 126 Hawai# i 125, 132, 267 P.3d 1230, 1237 (2011)). 
There, because the "actual damage being claimed was the loss of title," the earliest date of accrual was when title was deeded by the mortgagee, 
i.e., "when title was transferred to someone other 
than the Delapinias." Id.
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 In Schick v. Nationstar Mortgage LLC, No. CAAP-18-
0000103, 2022 WL 2315570, at *6 (Haw. App. June 28, 2022) (mem.), 
this court similarly determined that where the appellant alleged "depriv[ation] of possession, title, use, and occupancy of the [p]roperty," the date of accrual was when title to the subject property was deeded to a party other than the appellant-mortgagor. 
Here, it is undisputed that Nationstar transferred 
title to someone other than Guyer, namely, Fannie Mae, on March 30, 2011. The Complaint was filed on December 28, 2016, within the six-year statute of limitations. See id. Therefore, the 
Circuit Court erred in granting summary judgment for Nationstar and Fannie Mae on grounds that Guyer's wrongful foreclosure claim was time-barred by the statute of limitations.
C. Twenty-Year Statute of Limitations 
The remedy for a wrongful nonjudicial foreclosure 
governed by the six-year statute of limitations is that the transfer of property is voidable. Delapinia II, 150 Hawai# i at 
104, 497 P.3d at 119 ("
Hawai# i law has moved unmistakably towards 
the conclusion that sales pursuant to a wrongful foreclosure are voidable, regardless of whether the violation was statutory or contractual, substantial or a mere irregularity."). Further, "where the property has passed into the hands of an innocent purchaser for value, rendering the voiding of a foreclosure sale impracticable, an action at law for damages is generally the appropriate remedy." Id. (citations omitted). 
Given our ruling above, that Guyer's wrongful 
foreclosure claim was not time-barred, we need not reach Guyer's third argument that a twenty-year statute of limitations applies under HRS § 657-31. 
IV. Conclusion 
Based on the foregoing, we vacate the (1) "Final 
Judgment" entered on March 21, 2018 and (2) "Order Granting Defendants Nationstar Mortgage LLC's and Federal National Mortgage Association's Motion for Summary Judgment" entered on 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
