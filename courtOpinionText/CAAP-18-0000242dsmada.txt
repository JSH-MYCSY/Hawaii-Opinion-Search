OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
JULIE PERALTA, Claimant-Appellant,
v.
MAUI MEMORIAL MEDICAL CENTER, Employer-Appellee,
and
ACCLAMATION INSURANCE MANAGEMENT SERVICES,
Insurance Carrier-Appellee.
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
(CASE NO. AB 2016-388(M) (DCD NO. 7-95-10213))
ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL
FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(Ginoza, Chief Judge, Reifurth and Chan, JJ.)
Upon review of the May 30, 2018 motion filed by
Employer/Appellee/Appellee Maui Memorial Medical Center and
Insurance Carrier/Appellee/Appellee Acclamation Insurance
Management Services ( Employer/Carrier ) seeking to dismiss the
appeal of Claimant/Appellant/Appellant Julie Peralta ( Claimant),
pro se, from the February 16, 2018 Decision and Order of the
Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board (LIRAB) that denied
the reopening of her claim for additional permanent disability
benefits ( Motion to Dismiss Appeal ), it appears as follows.
An aggrieved party may appeal a final decision and
order by the LIRAB directly to the Hawai #i Intermediate Court of
Appeals pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 386-88 (2015)
and HRS § 91-14(a) (2012).  The appealability of a decision and
order of the LIRAB is governed by HRS § 91-14(a).  Bocalbos v. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Kapiolani Med. Ctr. , 89 Hawaii 436, 439, 974 P.2d 1026, 1029 #
(1999).
For purposes of HRS § 91-14(a), we have defined "final
order" to mean an order ending the proceedings, leaving
nothing further to be accomplished. . . .  Consequently, an
order is not final if the rights of a party involved remain
undetermined or if the matter is retained for further
action.
Id. (citation and some internal quotation marks omitted).  "[A]n
order that finally adjudicates a benefit or penalty under the
worker's compensation law is an appealable final order under HRS
§ 91-14(a), although other issues remain."  Lindinha v. Hilo
Coast Processing Co., 104 Hawai# i 164, 168, 86 P.3d 973, 977
(2004) (citation omitted). 
The LIRAB's February 16, 2018 Decision and Order
finally adjudicated whether Claimant was entitled to reopen her
claim for workers' compensation benefits.  Therefore, the LIRAB's
February 16, 2018 decision and order is an appealable decision
and order under HRS § 386-88 and HRS § 91-14(a).
However, Claimant filed her March 27, 2018 notice of
appeal more than thirty days after the mailing of a certified
copy of the February 16, 2018 decision and order, contrary to HRS
§ 386-88.1  Consequently, Claimant's appeal is untimely, and we
lack jurisdiction over the appeal.  
THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion to
Dismiss Appeal is granted, and the instant appeal is dismissed
for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, July 18, 2018.

1/  Claimant attached to her March 27, 2018 notice of appeal a request
for extension to file her notice of appeal, which did not cite any authority
and which LIRAB denied.
