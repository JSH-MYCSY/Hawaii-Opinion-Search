(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
Upon review of the record, it appears that:

Mendoza Aquino (Aquino), pro se, filed the notice of appeal;
(2) Aquino failed to pay the appellate filing and
docketing fees with the notice of appeal, as required by Hawai# i
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 3(a);
(3) That same day, the circuit court clerk notified
Aquino to pay the filing fee or request a fee waiver by April 10,
2018, or the appeal could be dismissed;
(4) On May 30, 2018, the appellate clerk entered a
default of the record on appeal, informing Aquino that the time
to docket the appeal expired on May 29, 2018, he had not paid the
filing fee or obtained an order allowing him to proceed on appeal
in forma pauperis, the matter would be brought to the court's
attention on June 12, 2018, for action that may include dismissal
of the appeal, and he could seek relief from default by motion;NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(5) The appellate clerk mailed the default notice to
Aquino at the address indicated in the notice of appeal.  The
United States Postal Service returned the notice as
undeliverable.  Aquino has not filed a notice of change of
address, as required by HRAP Rule 25(f), and he took no further
action in this appeal; and
(6) An appeal may be dismissed where the record on
appeal has not been prepared because the appellant failed to pay 
the required fees or obtain an order allowing the appellant to
proceed in forma pauperis .  HRAP Rule 11(b)(2), (c)(2).
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is
dismissed.
Dated: Honolulu, Hawai# i, June 26, 2018.
