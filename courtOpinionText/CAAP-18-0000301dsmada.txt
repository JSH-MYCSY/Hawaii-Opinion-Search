OF THE STATE OF HAWAI I #
STATE OF HAWAI I #, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v. 
MAGGIE KWONG, Defendant-Appellant. 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
HONOLULU DIVISION 
(Case No. 1DTA-17-02539) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Chan, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record of district court criminal 
case number 1DTA-17-02539 and the resulting appeal, it appears 
that we lack appellate jurisdiction over Defendant-Appellant 
Maggie Kwong's (Kwong) appeal from the Honorable William M. 
Domingo's March 14, 2018 judgment of conviction for operating a 
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant in violation of HRS 
§ 291E-61 (Supp. 2017), because the March 14, 2018 judgment 
indicates, on its face, that the district court's sentence is not 
yet final. 
"The right of appeal in a criminal case is purely 
statutory[.]" State v. Nicol, 140 Hawai# i 482, 485, 403 P.3d NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
259, 262 (2017) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
The Hawai# i Intermediate Court of Appeals has jurisdiction "[t]o 
hear and determine appeals from any court or agency when appeals are allowed by law[.]" HRS § 602-57(1) (2016). HRS § 641-12(a) 
(2016) is the statute providing that "[a]ppeals upon the record 
shall be allowed from all final decisions and final judgments of 
district courts in all criminal matters." Consequently, "in 
order to appeal a criminal matter in the district court, the 
appealing party must appeal from a written judgment or order that 
has been filed with the clerk of the court pursuant to 
HRAP Rule 4(b)(3)." State v. Bohannon, 102 Hawai# i 228, 236, 74 
P.3d 980, 988 (2003); see also Rule 32(c)(2) of the 
Hawai# i Rules 
of Penal Procedure. In order to perfect a defendant's right to 
appeal from a district court criminal case pursuant to HRS § 641-
12(a), the district court must enter either a judgment of 
conviction with a complete sentence or a judgment dismissing the 
complaint without prejudice, thereby terminating the proceedings 
and leaving nothing further to be accomplished by the district 
court. State v. Kilborn, 109 Hawai# i 435, 442, 127 P.3d 95, 102 
(App. 2005); Nicol, 140 Hawai# i at 491, 403 P.3d at 268.  If the 
sentence is not final, then the judgment is not appealable. 
Kilborn, 109 Hawai# i at 442, 127 P.3d at 102 (holding judgment 
without undecided restitution amount was not final.) 
The instant case is similar to Kilborn in that the 
district court's March 14, 2018 judgment expressly left open the possibility that the sentence might include something more, 
which, in this case, is the possible revocation of Kwong's 
driver's license. In Kwong's July 11, 2018 amended statement of 
jurisdiction, counsel for Kwong concedes that the March 14, 2018 
judgment is not an appealable final judgment under HRS § 641-12 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
because the district court's sentencing is not yet complete. 
Absent an appealable final judgment, we lack appellate 
jurisdiction. 
"Generally, the filing of a notice of appeal divests 
the trial court of jurisdiction over the appealed case." TSA 
International Limited v. Shimizu Corporation, 92 Hawai# i 243, 
265, 990 P.2d 713, 735 (1999) (citations omitted). "The general rule, however, assumes that the notice of appeal is valid under 
the applicable statutory provisions and procedural rules. Where 
the notice of appeal is jurisdictionally defective, filing the 
notice does not transfer jurisdiction from the trial court to the 
appellate court." State v. Ontiveros, 82 Hawai# i 446, 449, 923 
P.2d 388, 391 (1996) (citations omitted; emphasis added). In light of our lack of appellate jurisdiction, the pendency of 
Kwong's premature and jurisdictionally defective appeal has not 
divested the district court of jurisdiction to proceed forward 
with the resolution of the outstanding issue whether the district 
court will revoke Kwong's driver's license. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court 
case number CAAP-18-0000301 is dismissed for lack of appellate 
jurisdiction.
