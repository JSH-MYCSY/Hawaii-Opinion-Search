APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
NORTH AND SOUTH KONA DIVISION
(CASE NO. 3DTA-17-03816)
ORDER 
CONSOLIDATING CASE NUMBERS CAAP-18-0000304, CAAP-18-0000430 AND
CAAP-18-0000518 UNDER CASE NUMBER CAAP-18-0000304
AND 
DISMISSING CONSOLIDATED APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
Upon review of the record of district court criminal
case number 3DTA-17-03816 for the resulting appeals in appellate
court case numbers CAAP-18-0000304, CAAP-18-0000430, and CAAP-18-
0000518, it appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction pursuant
to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-12(a) (2016).  In these
three appeals, Defendant-Appellant Alfred Napahueluna Spinney
(Spinney), pro se, appeals from three interlocutory orders that
the Honorable Margaret Masunaga entered on March 29, 2018,NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
April 2, 2018, and May 23, 2018, during the pretrial proceedings
for Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawaii's December 22, 2017
complaint against Spinney for (1) operating a vehicle after
license and privilege have been suspended or revoked for
operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant in
violation of HRS § 291E-62 (Supp. 2017) and (2) operating a motor
vehicle without proof of liability insurance in violation of HRS
§ 431:10C-104 (2005).  Under these circumstances, the
consolidation and dismissal of these three appeals is warranted.
"The right of appeal in a criminal case is purely
statutory[.]"  State v. Nicol, 140 Hawai #i 482, 485, 403 P.3d
259, 262 (2017) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
The Hawai #i Intermediate Court of Appeals has jurisdiction "[t]o
hear and determine appeals from any court or agency when appeals
are allowed by law[.]"  HRS § 602-57(1) (2016).  HRS § 641-12(a)
is the statute providing that "[a]ppeals upon the record shall be
allowed from all final decisions and final judgments of district
courts in all criminal matters."  Consequently, "in order to
appeal a criminal matter in the district court, the appealing
party must appeal from a written judgment or order that has been
filed with the clerk of the court pursuant to [Hawai# i Rules of
Appellate Procedure] Rule 4(b)(3)."  State v. Bohannon , 102
Hawai#i 228, 236, 74 P.3d 980, 988 (2003);  see also  Rule 32(c)(2)
of the Hawai# i Rules of Penal Procedure;  State v. Kilborn , 109
Hawai#i 435, 442, 127 P.3d 95, 102 (App. 2005) (regarding the
appealability of a district court judgment of conviction); State
v. Hern, 133 Hawai# i 59, 62, 323 P.3d 1241, 1244 (App. 2013)
(regarding the appealability of a district court judgment
dismissing the complaint without prejudice).
In the instant three appeals, the March 29, 2018 order,
the April 2, 2018 order, and the May 23, 2018 order are not
independently appealable final orders under HRS § 641-12, and,
thus, they are interlocutory orders that would be eligible for
appellate review only by way of an appeal from an appealable
final judgment under the principle that, "[a]s a general rule, an
appeal from a final judgment in a case brings up for review all
preceding interlocutory orders in the case."  State v. Adam, 97
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Hawai#i 475, 482, 40 P.3d 877, 884 (2002) (citations omitted).
The district court has not yet entered a final judgment on the
State's original December 22, 2017 two-count complaint, and,
thus, we lack appellate jurisdiction over all three appeals.
Granted, on May 23, 2018, the district court entered a
"FINDINGS AND JUDGMENT OF SUMMARY-DIRECT CRIMINAL CONTEMPT"
against Spinney, finding that Spinney caused a breach of peace
and disturbance in open court, and, consequently, Spinney was
guilty of "summary-direct criminal contempt" in violation of
subsections (a) and (b) of HRS § 710-1077(1) (2014 & Supp. 2017)
under the circumstances described in HRS § 710-1077(3)(a).  The
district court sentenced Spinney to imprisonment for a term of
thirty days.  HRS § 710-1077(3)(a) authorizes a trial court to
treat a party's contempt of court as a petty misdemeanor when the
party commits the offense in the immediate view and presence of
the trial court:
(3) The court may treat the commission of an offense under
subsection (1) as a petty misdemeanor, in which case:
(a) If the offense was committed in the immediate view and
presence of the court, or under such circumstances
that the court has knowledge of all of the facts
constituting the offense, the court may order summary
conviction and disposition; . . . .
The district court's May 23, 2018 judgment pursuant to HRS § 710-
1077(3)(a) is not an appealable final judgment under HRS § 641-
12.  The Supreme Court of Hawai #i has held that, instead, "HRS
§ 710-1077(5) governs the procedures for an appeal of a
conviction of criminal contempt, pursuant to HRS § 710-
1077(3)(a)[.]"  State v. Tierney, 92 Hawai #i 178, 179, 989 P.2d
262, 263 (1999).  HRS § 710-1077(5) provides that "[a] judgment,
sentence, or commitment under subsection (3)(a) shall not be
subject to review by appeal, but shall be subject to review in an
appropriate proceeding for an extraordinary writ or in a special
proceeding for review."  (Emphasis added.)  Consequently, when a
party is "convicted of and sentenced for criminal contempt under
subsection (3)(a), HRS § 710-1077(5) requires that [the party]
seek review in a proceeding for an extraordinary writ or special
proceeding for review."  Tierney , 92 Hawai #i at 179, 989 P.2d at
263.  Thus, when a defendant, Tierney, attempted to appeal from a
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
district court conviction and sentence for criminal contempt of
court pursuant to HRS § 710-1077(3)(a) under the statute
authorizing defendants to appeal from district court judgments of
conviction, HRS § 641-12, the Tierney court "dismiss[ed]
Tierney's appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction."  Tierney,
92 Hawai #i at 179, 989 P.2d at 263.  Similarly in the instant
case, HRS § 710-1077(5) prevents the district court's May 23,
2018 judgment of conviction against Spinney for criminal contempt
in violation of HRS § 710-1077(3)(a) from qualifying as an
appealable judgment under HRS § 641-12.  Absent an appealable
final judgment under HRS § 641-12, we lack appellate jurisdiction
over all three of Spinney's appeals.1
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
case numbers CAAP-18-0000304, CAAP-18-0000430, and CAAP-18-
0000518 are consolidated under appellate court case number CAAP-
18-0000304.  The appellate court clerk shall file a copy of this
order in appellate court case numbers CAAP-18-0000304, CAAP-18-
0000430, and CAAP-18-0000518.
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that the consolidated
appeals in appellate court case number CAAP-18-0000304 are
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, June 29, 2018.
