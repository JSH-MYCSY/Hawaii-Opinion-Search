APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 3CC13100470K) 
MEMORANDUM OPINION 
(By:  Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and McCullen, JJ.) 
Aloha Insurance Services, Inc. and Chris Smith and 
Laura Jennison  arbitrated a business dispute.1  The Arbitrator 
was appointed by order entered on June 5, 2015.  The Arbitrator 
1 This appeal arises from two lawsuits that were consolidated by the
circuit court.  In JEFS No. 3CC13100421K, Smith and Jennison were the
petitioners and Aloha was the respondent.  In JEFS No. 3CC13100470K, Aloha wasthe plaintiff/counterclaim defendant; Smith was the defendant/counterclaimant;and Jennison was the defendant/counterclaimant/third-party plaintiff.  There are other parties to JEFS No. 3CC13100470K who are not parties to this appeal. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
issued an award on November 10, 2017.  Smith and Jennison moved 
to confirm the award.  Aloha moved to vacate the award. 
On February 15, 2018, the Circuit Court of the Third 
Circuit entered its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and
2Order.   The Order denied the motion to confirm and granted the 
motion to vacate without directing a rehearing.  Smith and 
Jennison appealed.  We have jurisdiction under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 658A-28(a)(3) and (5) (2016).  For the reasons 
explained below, we affirm the Order. 
Smith and Jennison don't challenge the circuit court's 
findings of fact.  They raise two points on appeal: (1) "The 
Circuit Court erred when it ruled that an undisclosed potential conflict of interest of the [A]rbitrator required as a matter of law that the arbitration award be vacated"; and (2) "The Circuit Court erred when, based on the undisputed facts of the case, it concluded that [the Arbitrator] had an undisclosed conflict of interest that warranted vacating the arbitration award."  The Order applied HRS § 658A-12, the statute requiring disclosures by an arbitrator.  "Statutory interpretation is a question of law reviewable de novo."  Noel Madamba Contracting LLC v. Romero, 137 
Hawai# i 1, 9, 364 P.3d 518, 526 (2015) (citation omitted). 
The parties disagree on which version of HRS § 658A-12 
applies to this case.  The statute was amended effective July 11, 2017.  2017 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 187, § 3 at 671.  Aloha contends that the former version, in effect when the Arbitrator was appointed, and when the arbitration hearings were conducted, applies.
3  Smith and Jennison contend that the current version, 
in effect when the arbitration award was issued, the motions to confirm and to vacate were filed, and the Order was entered, applies.  We conclude that the former version of the statute applies under the undisputed facts of this case. 
2 The Honorable Robert D.S. Kim presided. 
3 The arbitration hearings were held on May 1-5, 8-12, June 21-23,
and 26-29, 2017.

Hawai i # adopted the Uniform Arbitration Act ( UAA) in 
2001.  2001 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 265, §§ 1, 5 at 810-20.  Act 265 
was codified at HRS Chapter 658A.  HRS § 658A-12 originally provided: 
Disclosure by arbitrator .  (a) Before accepting appointment,
an individual who is requested to serve as an arbitrator,
after making a reasonable inquiry, shall disclose to allparties to the agreement to arbitrate and arbitrationproceeding and to any other arbitrators any known facts thata reasonable person would consider likely to affect theimpartiality of the arbitrator in the arbitrationproceeding, including: 
(1) A financial or personal interest in the outcome
of the arbitration proceeding; and 
(2) An existing or past relationship with any of the
parties to the agreement to arbitrate or thearbitration proceeding, their counsel orrepresentatives, a witness, or anotherarbitrator. 
(b) An arbitrator has a continuing obligation to
disclose to all parties to the agreement to arbitrate andarbitration proceeding and to any other arbitrators anyfacts that the arbitrator learns after accepting appointmentwhich a reasonable person would consider likely to affectthe impartiality of the arbitrator. 
(c) If an arbitrator discloses a fact required by
subsection (a) or (b) to be disclosed and a party timelyobjects to the appointment or continued service of thearbitrator based upon the fact disclosed, the objection maybe a ground under section 658A-23(a)(2) for vacating anaward made by the arbitrator. 
(d) If the arbitrator did not disclose a fact as 
required by subsection (a) or (b), upon timely objection bya party, the court under section 658A-23(a)(2) may vacate anaward.  
(e) An arbitrator appointed as a neutral arbitrator
who does not disclose a known, direct, and material interestin the outcome of the arbitration proceeding or a known,existing, and substantial relationship with a party ispresumed to act with evident partiality under section658A-23(a)(2). 
(f) If the parties to an arbitration proceeding
agree to the procedures of an arbitration organization orany other procedures for challenges to arbitrators before an
award is made, substantial compliance with those procedures
is a condition precedent to a motion to vacate an award onthat ground under section 658A-23(a)(2). 
HRS § 658A-12 (2016).

In Nordic PCL Constr., Inc. v. LPIHGC, LLC, 136 Hawai# i 
29, 358 P.3d 1 (2015), the supreme court stated: 
At first glance, it may seem that after a
determination that an arbitrator failed to disclose a fact a 
reasonable person would consider likely to affect hisimpartiality, there must also be a separate finding that thearbitrator acted with "evident partiality" or bias before anaward can be vacated.  As explained below, however, afailure to meet disclosure requirements under HRS § 658A-12(a) or (b) is equivalent to, or constitutes, "evidentpartiality" as a matter of law . 
Id. at 50, 358 P.3d at 22 (emphasis added).  However, later in 
its opinion the supreme court stated that if the party seeking to vacate the award sustained its "burden of proving evident partiality, i.e., the failure to disclose facts that a reasonable person would consider likely to have affected the Arbitrator's impartiality[,]" id. at 52, 358 P.3d at 24, "the circuit court . . . has discretion under HRS § 658A–12(d) to decide whether or not to grant the motion to vacate[,]" id. at 53, 358 P.3d at 25 (emphasis added). 
Then, in Madamba, the supreme court stated: "if a 
neutral arbitrator demonstrates evident partiality, the arbitration award shall be vacated" as a matter of law.  137 
Hawai# i at 16, 364 P.3d at 533.  The supreme court explained the 
seeming paradox in a third case, Narayan v. Ass'n of Apt. Owners of Kapalua Bay Condo., 140 Hawai# i 75, 398 P.3d 664 (2017): 
In Madamba, we held that a finding of evident
partiality based on a violation of HRS § 658A-12(a) or (b)
by a neutral arbitrator requires  the court to vacate the 
arbitration award pursuant to HRS § 658A-23(a)(2)(A).  137 
Hawai #i at 16, 364 P.3d at 533.  We recognized the
permissive language of HRS § 658A-12(d) but found thefollowing: 
The function of the 'may' language . . . is to providereference to the different circumstances that requirevacatur under HRS § 658A-23(a)(2), i.e., a neutralarbitrator's evident partiality, and any arbitrator'scorruption or misconduct.  For example, if a non-neutral arbitrator fails to make a disclosure requiredunder HRS § 658A-12(a) or (b), although the awardwould not be vacated based on evident partiality — asevident partiality only applies to neutral arbitrators
— it could be vacated based on the corruption and
misconduct provisions in HRS § 658A-23(a)(2).

Id. (citation and footnote omitted).  We also noted that the 
Commentary "takes into account the fact that jurisdictionshave developed different views regarding what constitutesevident partiality," so the standard for evident partialitydue to nondisclosure will differ among jurisdictions thathave adopted the UAA.  137 
Hawai #i at 16 n.20, 364 P.3d at 
533 n.20.  "[O]ur standard for evident partiality based on a
failure to disclose is equivalent to the standard laid outin HRS § 658A-12's disclosure provisions .  Accordingly, in
this context, once evident partiality [as to a neutralarbitrator] is established, the arbitration award must  be 
vacated."  Id. 
Based on the standards outlined in Nordic and 
clarified in Madamba, an arbitrator's compliance with thedisclosure requirements set forth in [HRS] §§ 658A-12(a) and(b) is paramount to the validity of an arbitration award. 
Id. at 86, 398 P.3d at 675 (emphasis added). 
In 2017, in response to Nordic and Madamba, the 
legislature introduced a bill to amend HRS § 658A-12.  The Senate 
Committee on Judiciary and Labor reported: 
Your Committee finds that two recent decisions by the
Supreme Court of Hawaii in Nordic PCL Construction, Inc. v.
LPIHGC, LLC, 136 Hawaii 29 (2015) and Noel MadambaContracting LLC v. Romero, 137 Hawaii 1 (2015) have resultedin implications to the arbitration process and have possibleunintended consequences.  Specifically, these two decisionsaffected the law relating to the disclosure requirements ofan arbitrator that authorizes the trial court to vacate an 
arbitration award if the arbitrator failed to disclose a 
known fact that a reasonable person would consider likely toaffect the impartiality of the arbitrator.  In these two cases, the court held that an arbitrator's nondisclosure ofinformation that may affect the arbitrator's impartialityconstituted evident partiality as a matter of law  and that 
the court was required  to vacate the arbitrator's decision. 
This measure authorizes the trial court to determine the facts then impose relief that is appropriate  and provides
specific standards to enable the trial court to determinewhether the arbitrator failed to disclose an interest or relationship that a reasonable person would consider likelyto affect the impartiality of the arbitrator and whether to 
vacate  an award made by an arbitrator who failed to disclose
that information.

(new material looks like this; [deletions look like this]):

2017 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 187, § 1 at 670-71.  Act 187 took effect 
on July 11, 2017, when it was approved by Governor Ige.  Id. § 3 at 671. 
HRS § 1-3 (2009) provides: "No law has any 
retrospective operation, unless otherwise expressed or obviously intended."  HRS § 658A-12 (Supp. 2017) contains no provision for retrospective operation.  Nor does the legislative history of Act 187 show any intent for the statutory amendments to apply retrospectively.  Accordingly, we consider whether retroactive
4 
application of the 2017 amendment to HRS § 658A-12 in this case would impair existing rights, create new obligations, or impose additional duties with respect to past transactions — or would merely alter the means of enforcing or giving effect to preexisting rights.  Gov't Emps. Ins. Co. v. Hyman, 90 
Hawai# i 1, 
5, 975 P.2d 211, 215 (1999). 
Before Act 187 took effect, a potential arbitrator was 
required to disclose all  financial or personal interests they had 
in the outcome of the arbitration proceeding, and all  existing or 
past relationships they had with a party to the arbitration proceeding or its counsel or representatives, a witness, or another arbitrator.  The disclosure obligation continued after selection of the arbitrator, to protect the right of the parties to a fair and impartial arbitration.  This is important because an arbitrator's findings of fact and conclusions of law are not subject to judicial review even if clearly erroneous or wrong. Nordic, 136 
Hawai# i at 42, 358 P.3d at 14. 
Since Act 187 took effect, a potential arbitrator is 
required to disclose only "direct and material" interests in the outcome of the arbitration proceeding, and only "substantial" 
4 We use the terms "retroactive" and "retrospective"
interchangeably; "[t]here is no difference in principle between a
retrospective law and a retroactive law, either of which is one which takesaway or impairs vested rights acquired under a different law or creates a newobligation, imposes a new duty or attaches a new disability in respect totransactions or consideration already past."  Roe v. Doe, 59 Haw. 259, 263-64,581 P.2d 310, 314 (1978) (citing Oleson v. Borthwick, 33 Haw. 766, 774 (Haw.Terr. 1936)).

relationships with a party or its counsel or representatives, a 
witness, or another arbitrator.  Thus did Act 187 limit an arbitrator's obligation to disclose — and thus the parties' right to receive — information about potential conflicts of interest, before and after an arbitrator is selected. 
Before Act 187 took effect, an arbitration award had to 
be vacated as a matter of law if a party showed that an arbitrator violated the disclosure provisions of HRS § 658A-12(a) or (b), which the supreme court held was the "standard for evident partiality based on a failure to disclose[.]"  Narayan, 140 
Hawai# i at 86, 398 P.3d at 675 (quoting Madamba, 137 Hawai# i 
at 16 n.20, 364 P.3d at 533 n.20).  In effect, the party that prevailed in the arbitration could be held strictly liable for the arbitrator's failure — however inadvertent — to disclose any relationship required to be disclosed under HRS § 658A-12(a) or (b), and lose the benefit and finality of the award. 
Since Act 187 took effect, an arbitrator's failure to 
disclose the (now more limited) information required by HRS § 658A-12(a) or (b) is no longer grounds for vacating the award as a matter of law.  Rather, the party challenging the award is required to prove that an arbitrator failed to disclose a "direct and material" interest in the outcome of the arbitration, or a "substantial" relationship with a party or its counsel or representatives, a witness, or another arbitrator.  HRS § 658A-12(a) (Supp. 2017).  The party prevailing under the award can argue that the undisclosed information does not show a direct or material interest in the outcome of the arbitration, or does not establish a substantial relationship with a party or its counsel or representatives, a witness, or another arbitrator.  The circuit court then has discretion to determine whether the arbitrator's failure to disclose constituted evident partiality, warranting vacation of the award.  HRS § 658A-12(d) (Supp. 2017). The differences are not merely procedural.  Act 187 eliminated the strict liability standard and created new substantive burdens

for parties challenging or defending an arbitration award under 
HRS § 658A-23(a)(2). 
We decline to apply Act 187 retroactively in this case. 
Hyman, 90 Hawai# i at 5, 975 P.2d at 215; Clark v. Cassidy, 64 
Haw. 74, 77-78, 636 P.2d 1344, 1346-47 (1981).  The Arbitrator's HRS § 658A-12 disclosure obligations attached when the Arbitrator was being considered by the parties for appointment, and continued through the hearing process, all of which took place before Act 187 took effect.  The circuit court found — and Smith and Jennison do not contest — that the Arbitrator failed to timely disclose information required by HRS § 658A-12(a) and (b) (2016).  The court concluded that this established evident partiality as a matter of law, granted Aloha's motion to vacate the award, and denied Smith and Jennison's motion to confirm the award.  The court's conclusion was supported by its findings and reflected an application of the correct rule of law.  It will not be overturned.  Est. of Klink ex rel. Klink v. State, 113 Hawai# i 
332, 351, 152 P.3d 504, 523 (2007). 
Based upon the foregoing, the "Findings of Fact, 
Conclusions of Law and Order" entered by the circuit court on February 15, 2018, is affirmed.
