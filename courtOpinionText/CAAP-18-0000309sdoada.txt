) appeals from the "Findings of Fact, 
Conclusions of Law, and Judgment Denying Rule 40 Petition for 
Post-Conviction Relief" (Judgment) entered by the Circuit Court 
of the Second Circuit  on March 20, 2018. For the reasons 
explained below, we affirm the Judgment. 1
BACKGROUND 
[On] November 19, 1994, Cornelio participated in a
brawl near the entrance of Kahekili Beach Park on the island
of Maui. At some point . . . Cornelio removed a sawed-offshotgun from the trunk of his car, loaded the weapon, andpointed it at the head of Vahafolau Faleta[.] . . . Inresponse . . . Faleta (who was evidently a much larger man)disarmed, beat, and pursued Cornelio down the beach[.] . . .Faleta pummeled [Cornelio] with his fists and [with]Cornelio's shotgun until a bystander intervened and broke upthe fight. . . . After arriving at the scene, the policeconfiscated the shotgun and determined that its barrel wasseventeen and three-quarters inches in length.

State v. Cornelio, 84 Hawai# i 476, 480, 935 P.2d 1021, 1025 
(1997). 
Cornelio was indicted on five counts: (1) terroristic 
threatening in the first degree; (2) place to keep firearm;
(3) prohibited possession of a firearm; 
(4) prohibited possession 
of firearm ammunition; and (5) possession of a prohibited firearm or device. On April 11, 1995, a jury found him guilty as charged 
on all counts. It was Cornelio's third felony conviction. 
During sentencing the State established Cornelio's 
previous felony convictions. In 1987, when Cornelio was 17-1/2 years old, he was discovered having sexual intercourse with a 13-year-old girl while both were patients at the Hawai# i State 
Hospital. 
The girl stated that Cornelio had removed her clothes 
and forced her to have sex with him. The family court waived jurisdiction; Cornelio was tried as an adult and was convicted of rape in the second degree. Cornelio, 84 Hawai# i at 481 n.13, 935 
P.2d at 1026 n.13. 
In 1989, while awaiting trial on the rape 
charge, Cornelio was discovered shooting cattle with a rifle (he wounded a bull and killed a calf), and was subsequently convicted of place to keep firearm, prohibited possession of firearm, and criminal property damage in the second degree. Id. at 481 n.14, 
935 P.2d at 1026 n.14. 
Cornelio had been paroled from prison on 
October 12, 1994 — one month before the brawl that resulted in his third felony conviction. Id. at 481, 935 P.2d at 1026. 
At the conclusion of the sentencing hearing, the 
circuit court
2 addressed Cornelio: 
. . . I have to look at what you've done in the past in order
to determine what's appropriate at the present time as wellas what's appropriate punishment for the conduct you engagedin. 
And when the court looks at your record, it's apparent you're
not able to control your behavior. And you knew youshouldn't have had a gun, and . . . somehow you got a sawed-off shotgun driving around . . . in your car. 
And I know nobody got killed, but I'm amazed that somebody
didn't get killed. What I have to conclude from yourbehavior is that you are a danger to the community. You goaround shooting other people's cows. You've got a sawed-offshotgun as soon as you get out of prison. 
2 The Honorable Shackley F. Raffetto presided. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
I'm s[u]re you knew what you were doing was wrong, but you
still weren't able to control your behavior, that's thepoint, and when you can't, you're a danger to the community. 
So I have to take you off the streets. Because other people
have a right to be safe from that sort of conduct. You know people who send their children to school every day and otherpeople who drive along the highway out in Kaupak[u]lua whereyou were shooting the animals. They have a right to be awayfrom all that. 
You have no right to conduct yourself in that manner, but I
want you to understand where we're coming from here — 
. . . . 
. . . I hope some day you may be able to reflect upon whythings are happening to you and reflect that it's yourbehavior that caused you to be here today. 
It's not 
somebody's else [sic]. 
You're here because you failed to be able to control
yourself, and now the court's forced to take you out ofcirculation so you can't be out there creating dangerouscircumstances for other citizens. 
Cornelio, 84 Hawai# i at 481-82, 935 P.2d at 1026-27 (alterations 
in original). 
Cornelio was sentenced to indeterminate 10-year 
prison terms on counts 2, 3, and 4, and to indeterminate 5-year 
prison terms on counts 1 and 5, with mandatory minimum terms of 3 years and 4 months on counts 1-4 and 1 year and 8 months on count 5, all terms to run consecutively. Id. at 482, 935 P.2d at 
1027. 
Accordingly, the cumulative sentence was for an indeter-
minate maximum prison term of 40 years, with a mandatory minimum term of 15 years before being eligible for parole. Id. at 480, 
935 P.2d at 1025. That sentence was to run consecutive to the sentence on Cornelio's rape conviction. Id. at 482, 935 P.2d at 
1027. A "Judgment Guilty Conviction and Sentence" was entered on October 13, 1995. An "Amended Judgment Guilty Conviction and 
Sentence" was entered on December 20, 1995. 
Direct Appeal 
Cornelio appealed his sentence. He did not challenge 
the imposition of consecutive indeterminate maximum terms of 
imprisonment on counts 1-5; he challenged only the circuit court's decision to run his mandatory minimum terms of imprison-ment consecutively. The Hawai# i Supreme Court held that 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(1) adjudications of guilt on multiple counts charged in the same
indictment must be treated as a single conviction for purposes ofsentencing under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 706-606.5,

another, but (3) a defendant subjected to mandatory minimum termsof imprisonment pursuant to HRS § 706-660.1  may be sentenced to

P.2d at 1025. The supreme court affirmed Cornelio's sentence as to count (1) but vacated the remainder and remanded to the circuit court for resentencing. Id. 4

5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 First Rule 40 Petition 
On May 5, 1997 (before he was resentenced), Cornelio 
filed a petition under Hawai# i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) 
Rule 40 (
First Rule 40 Petition). See Cornelio v. State, 
No. 28684, 2008 WL 5064906, at *2 (Haw. App. Nov. 25, 2008) 
(mem.). 
He argued that he was wrongfully convicted based on: 
evidence acquired through unconstitutional search and seizure; prosecutorial misconduct because the State failed to call Sione Pese, who had exculpatory evidence, as a witness; ineffective assistance of counsel; and newly discovered evidence that the picture of the shotgun introduced into evidence was not the same gun that he allegedly possessed. Id. The circuit court denied 
the First Rule 40 Petition without a hearing. Id. Cornelio 
appealed, arguing only that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to call Pese as a witness. Id. The Hawai# i Supreme 
Court summarily affirmed the circuit court's order. See Cornelio 
v. State, No. 20819 (Haw. June 4, 1998) (SDO) (Westlaw). 
Meanwhile, Cornelio was resentenced on May 13, 1997. A 
"Second Amended Judgment Guilty Conviction and Sentence" was 
entered on February 3, 2000. The State filed a motion to correct inaccuracies in the circuit court's minutes and in the Second Amended Judgment; Cornelio's then-counsel agreed that the minutes and amended judgment were inaccurate and needed to be corrected. Cornelio v. State, No. CAAP-13-0005273, 2014 WL 4284133, at *2-3 (Haw. App. Aug. 29, 2014) (mem.). As a result, the "Third 
Amended Judgment Guilty Conviction and Sentence" was entered on 
June 7, 2000. Cornelio was again sentenced to 5 years on counts 
1 and 5, and to 10 years on counts 2, 3, and 4, with: 
All indeterminate terms to run consecutive to each other for 
a total of forty years. Defendant to serve a mandatoryminimum term of 3 years, 4 months in count 1; 3 years, 4months in counts 2, 3, 4 and 1 year, 8 months in count 5.Mandatory minium [sic] terms in counts 2, 3, 4, 5 to runconcurrent to each other, however consecutive to count 1 fora total of 6 years, 8 months. Terms to run consecutive to [the term for the rape conviction]. Credit for time served.

6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Second Rule 40 Petition 
On May 17, 2005, Cornelio filed another HRPP Rule 40 
petition (Second Rule 40 Petition).  He argued that the circuit 
court erred by failing to instruct the jury that in order to 
convict Cornelio of the multiple offenses with which he was charged, it was required to find that Cornelio acted with "separate and distinct intents" for each of the charged offenses. See Cornelio, 2008 WL 5064906, at *2. The circuit court denied the petition without a hearing. Cornelio appealed, arguing that the circuit court failed to give a "separate and distinct intents" instruction to the jury and that he was denied effective assistance of trial and appellate counsel because (a) trial counsel failed to request the jury instruction and (b) appellate counsel failed to challenge the trial court's failure to instruct the jury on direct appeal. Id. The supreme court affirmed, 
holding that Cornelio had waived all issues presented in the appeal. Cornelio v. State, No. 27395, 2006 WL 3190339, at *3 
(Haw. Nov. 6, 2006) (SDO). 
Post-Judgment Motions 
On February 9, 2007, Cornelio filed a "Motion for the 
Clarification of the Judgement [sic] and Sentence[.]" The 
circuit court denied the motion on March 14, 2007. On March 7, 2007, Cornelio filed a "Motion for the Correction of Illegal Conviction and Sentence." The circuit court denied the motion on March 7, 2007. Cornelio filed notices of appeal on March 21, 2007. We dismissed Cornelio's appeals because he did not pay the appellate filing fee or submit a motion to proceed in forma pauperis. State v. Cornelio, No. 28497, 2007 WL 2358671, at *1 
(Haw. App. Aug. 15, 2007) (order dismissing appeal); see Cornelio, 2008 WL 5064906, at *3; Cornelio, 2014 WL 4284133, at *3. 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Third Rule 40 Petition 
On March 22, 2007, Cornelio filed his Third Rule 40 
Petition. He argued that a challenge to an illegal sentence may 
be brought at any time under HRPP Rule 40(a)(1)(iii), and that 
the convictions and sentences imposed for counts 2, 3, 4, and 5 violated the double-jeopardy and cruel-and-unusual-punishment clauses of the United States and Hawai# i constitutions. 
Cornelio, 2008 WL 5064906, at *3. The circuit court denied the petition without a hearing. Id. Cornelio appealed. We held 
that offenses charged in counts 2, 3, and 5 were separate offenses for multiple-punishment purposes, and did not raise a colorable claim that his sentences for those counts violated the prohibition against double jeopardy. Id. at *5-6. However, we 
held that Cornelio raised a colorable claim that he was improperly punished for both count 3 (the prohibited-possession-of-firearm charge) and count 4 (the prohibited-possession-of-ammunition charge), and remanded the case to the circuit court for a hearing on that claim. Id. at *5. 
On remand, the circuit court granted the State's motion 
to dismiss count 4. The "Fourth Amended Judgment Guilty 
Conviction and Sentence" was entered on September 13, 2011. 
Cornelio was sentenced to 5 years on counts 1 and 5, and 10 years on counts 2 and 3, to run consecutive to each other for a total of 30 years, with: 
Defendant to serve a mandatory minimum term of 3 years,
4 months, each in counts 1, 2 & 3; and 1 year, 8 months incount 5. Mandatory minimum terms in counts 1, 2, 3, & 5 torun concurrent to each other. This sentence to run consecutive with the sentence imposed in [the rapeconviction]. Defendant shall be given credit for timeserved. 
(Reformatted.) 
Fourth Rule 40 Petition 
On July 25, 2013, Cornelio filed his Fourth Rule 40 
Petition. He claimed that the Third Amended Judgment and Fourth 
Amended Judgment were illegal because they were more severe than 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the Second Amended Judgment, in violation of HRS § 706-609. 
Cornelio, 2014 WL 4284133, at *4. The circuit court denied the petition without a hearing. Id. We affirmed, holding that the 
Third Amended Judgment and Fourth Amended Judgment did not impose a new sentence for the same offense which was more severe than the Amended Judgment, and that the circuit court did not violate HRS § 706-609. Id. at *5. The Hawai# i Supreme Court rejected 
Cornelio's application for writ of certiorari. Cornelio v. 
State, No. SCWC-13-0005273, 2015 WL 340838 (Haw. Jan. 26, 2015). 
Fifth Rule 40 Petition 
On June 8, 2015, Cornelio filed his Fifth Rule 40 
Petition. He claimed that the circuit court erred: 
A. when it failed to instruct the jury regarding merger; 
B. by imposing an illegal sentence in violation of HRS
§ 701-109(1)(e); 
C. by denying him the right to trial by jury because he
was sentenced based upon "judge found facts"; D. by denying him equal protection under the law; 
E. by imposing separate sentences for each conviction
"without the authorization of the Jury"; F. by violating double jeopardy for convicting him of five
firearm offenses when there was only one firearm incident; G. by imposing cruel and unusual punishment; and 
H. by imposing a disparate sentence in violation of HRS
§ 706-606(4). 
See Cornelio v. State, No. CAAP-15-0000743, 2016 WL 4764952, at 
*1 (Haw. App. Sept. 13, 2016) (SDO). The circuit court denied the petition without a hearing. Id. We affirmed, holding that 
the issues raised by Cornelio were previously ruled upon, waived, or patently frivolous and without a trace of support in the record or other evidence submitted by Cornelio. Id. The Hawai# i 
Supreme Court rejected Cornelio's application for writ of certiorari. Cornelio v. State, No. SCWC-15-0000743, 2016 WL 
7373911 (Haw. Dec. 20, 2016). 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Sixth Rule 40 Petition 
On April 25, 2016, Cornelio filed his Sixth Rule 40 
Petition, challenging the revocation of his parole. The circuit 
court denied the petition without a hearing on July 19, 2016. 
Cornelio did not appeal. 
Seventh Rule 40 Petition 
On June 20, 2017, Cornelio filed his Seventh Rule 40 
Petition. He argued: 
A. illegal sentence under HRS § 706-668.5; 
B. overdetention; 
C. double jeopardy violation; and 
D. cruel and unusual punishment. 
The circuit court denied the petition without a hearing on 
July 31, 2017. Cornelio did not appeal. 
Current Rule 40 Petition 
On January 3, 2018, Cornelio filed his eighth Rule 40 
petition. He again argued that his multiple sentences were 
illegal. On February 13, 2018, Cornelio filed a motion to amend his petition to add a claim for relief based on being deprived of effective assistance of trial counsel. The circuit court entered the Judgment on March 20, 2018. This appeal followed. 
DISCUSSION 
HRPP Rule 40(a)(3) provides, in relevant part: 
Rule 40 proceedings shall not be available and relief
thereunder shall not be granted where the issues sought to beraised have been previously ruled upon or were waived.Except for a claim of illegal sentence, an issue is waived ifthe petitioner knowingly and understandingly failed to raiseit and it could have been raised before the trial, at thetrial, on appeal, in a habeas corpus proceeding or any otherproceeding actually conducted, or in a prior proceedingactually initiated under this rule, and the petitioner isunable to prove the existence of extraordinary circumstances 
10 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to justify the petitioner's failure to raise the issue.
There is a rebuttable presumption that a failure to appeal aruling or to raise an issue is a knowing and understandingfailure. 
HRPP Rule 40(f) provides, in relevant part: 
[T]he court may deny a hearing if the petitioner's claim ispatently frivolous and is without trace of support either inthe record or from other evidence submitted by thepetitioner. . . . 
. . . . 
Where the petition alleges the ineffective assistance
of counsel as a ground upon which the requested relief shouldbe granted, the petitioner shall serve written notice of thehearing upon the counsel whose assistance is alleged to havebeen ineffective and said counsel shall have an opportunityto be heard. 
A trial court's denial of an HRPP Rule 40 petition is reviewed de 
novo. Dan v. State, 76 Hawai‘ i 423, 427, 879 P.2d 528, 532 
(1994). 
Illegal Sentence 
Cornelio first argues that "the illegal sentences 
violates [sic] the Constitution in two ways: First, it violated 
Double Jeopardy through HRS 701-109(e) by dividing the single firearm offense into several statutory offenses and sentences and; Secondly, it violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment[.]" 
Cornelio's double jeopardy argument was raised in his 
Second Rule 40 Petition and rejected by the supreme court in Cornelio, 2006 WL 3190339, at *2-3. It was raised again in the Third Rule 40 Petition and rejected in Cornelio, 2008 WL 5064906, at *5-6. It was raised for the third time in the Fifth Rule 40 Petition and we rejected it in Cornelio, 2016 WL 4764952, at *1. The Hawai# i Supreme Court rejected Cornelio's application for 
writ of certiorari. Cornelio, 2016 WL 7373911, at *1. It was 
raised for the fourth time in the Seventh Rule 40 Petition, 
11 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
rejected by the circuit court, and not appealed. Cornelio's 
double jeopardy argument was previously ruled upon, is patently frivolous and is without trace of support either in the record or from other evidence submitted by the petitioner. 
Cornelio's equal protection argument was raised in his 
Fifth Rule 40 Petition. We rejected it in Cornelio, 2016 WL 4764952, at *1. The Hawai# i Supreme Court rejected Cornelio's 
application for writ of certiorari. Cornelio, 2016 WL 7373911, 
at *1. Cornelio's equal protection argument was previously ruled upon, is patently frivolous and is without trace of support either in the record or from other evidence submitted by the petitioner. 
Ineffective Assistance of Counsel 
Cornelio's opening brief presents no argument on his 
claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. This 
point is deemed waived. Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
Rule 28(b)(7) (requiring appellant's opening brief to include "[t]he argument, containing the contentions of the appellant on the points presented and the reasons therefor, with citations to the authorities, statutes and parts of the record relied on[,]" and stating, "Points not argued may be deemed waived."); see Nelson v. Hawaiian Homes Comm'n, 141 Hawai# i 411, 419 n.7, 412 
P.3d 917, 925 n.7 (2018). 
In addition, it was raised in the 
First Rule 40 Petition and ultimately rejected by the supreme court in Cornelio
, No. 20819. Finally, the record contains no 
indication that Cornelio served his claim for ineffective assistance of counsel upon counsel whom he claims was ineffec-tive, as required by HRPP Rule 40(f). His claim was previously ruled upon, is patently frivolous and is without trace of support either in the record or from other evidence submitted by the petitioner.

For the foregoing reasons, the "Findings of Fact, 
Conclusions of Law, and Judgment Denying Rule 40 Petition for
