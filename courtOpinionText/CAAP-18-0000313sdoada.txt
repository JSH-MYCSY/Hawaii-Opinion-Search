IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
THE ESTATE OF WOOLSEY EATON KANAEUILANI RICE 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(PROBATE NO. 1LP171000629) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By:  Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and Nakasone, JJ.) 
In this will contest, Respondents-Appellants Beth Ann 
Burgess and Faye Wong appeal from the "Order Granting Petition 
for Probate of Will and Appointment of Personal Representative" 
entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Probate Court) 
on March 7, 2018, and the "Judgment Pursuant to Order Granting 
Petition for Probate of Will and Appointment of Personal 
Representative" entered by the Probate Court on February 20, 2019.
1  For the reasons explained below, we affirm the Order and 
the Judgment. 
Woolsey Eaton Kanaeuilani Rice died on April 20, 2017.  
On September 15, 2017, Woolsey Eaton Rice, Jr. filed a "Petition 
for Probate of Will and Appointment of Personal Representative" 
with the Probate Court.  The Petition prayed that Rice's will, dated April 27, 2012 (the 2012 Will), be admitted to probate and 
that Rice, Jr. be appointed as Rice's personal representative. 
1 The Honorable R. Mark Browning presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Petition stated that Rice, Jr. was Rice's son, and that 
Burgess and Wong were Rice's daughters. 
Burgess and Wong filed an objection to the Petition on 
November 9, 2017.  They claimed that Rice had executed a will on August 31, 2015 (the 2015 Will), which revoked the 2012 Will.  A 
copy of the 2015 Will was attached to a declaration signed by 
Burgess's and Wong's attorney. 
The 2012 Will was presented for probate on November 28, 
2017. 
The Petition was heard on November 30, 2017.  The 
Probate Court stated: 
Okay.  I have here a 2012 will that was supposedly 
revoked.  I have a 2015 will.  Neither of those wills have 
been probated.  I have no understanding of the status of the[related] civil action and what's going on.  You know, youguys give me something better than what you've given me. 
. . . . 
Okay?  So probate the wills.  Are you intending to put 
the wills -- file the wills?  I mean, you filed 'em as copies.  That's not the same thing.  You gotta probate 'em. We've gotta know what we're -- I have to know what I'mdealing with.  I mean, there's gotta be a decision withrespect to which will applies. 
The court continued the hearing to February 8, 2018. 
Seventy-one days later, at the continued hearing, the 
Probate Court said to counsel for Burgess and Wong: 
[T]he last time we were here, you were talking aboutsubmitting the 2015 will that you purport controls in thismatter.  That was not submitted.  The only will that I have is the 2012. 
Burgess and Wong requested another continuance.  A discussion 
followed, during which the parties presented conflicting reports about the status of settlement negotiations.  The Probate Court denied a continuance, admitted the 2012 Will into probate, and orally granted the Petition. 
The Order was entered on March 7, 2018.  The Probate 
Court entered "Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law" on

May 30, 2018.  The Judgment was entered on February 20, 2019. 
This appeal followed. 
The opening brief states a single point of error: 
1. The trial court abused its discretion and denied 
[Burgess and Wong] their due process rights in granting the
Petition for Probate of Will and Appointment of PersonalRepresentative without taking testimony and holding a properevidentiary hearing, and completely disregarding the August2015 Will that revoked all prior wills and codicils anddisinherited [Rice, Jr.]. 
A trial court's decision to grant or deny a continuance 
of proceedings is reviewed for abuse of discretion.  Onaka v. 
Onaka, 112 Hawai# i 374, 378, 146 P.3d 89, 93 (2006).  "It is well 
established that an abuse of discretion occurs if the trial court has clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party-litigant."  Id. (cleaned up). 
The statement of points in Burgess's and Wong's opening 
brief does not challenge any of the Probate Court's findings of fact.  Findings of fact that are not specified as error pursuant to Rule 28(b)(4)(C) of the Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
(HRAP)
2 are unchallenged on appeal.  Leibert v. Fin. Factors, 
2 HRAP Rule 28 provides, in relevant part: 
(b)  Opening brief .  Within 40 days after the filing
of the record on appeal, the appellant shall file an opening
brief, containing the following sections in the order hereindicated: 
. . . . 
(4)  
A concise statement of the points of error set
forth in separately numbered paragraphs.  Each point shallstate: (i) the alleged error committed by the court oragency; (ii) where in the record the alleged error occurred;and (iii) where in the record the alleged error was objectedto or the manner in which the alleged error was brought tothe attention of the court or agency.  Where applicable,each point shall also include the following: 
. . . . 
(C)  
when the point involves a finding or conclusion
of the court or agency, either a quotation of the finding orconclusion urged as error or reference to appended findings

[of fact] is not properly attacked, it is binding; and any conclusion [of law] which follows from it and is a correct statement of law is valid."  Kawamata Farms, Inc. v. United Agri Prods., 86 Hawai# i 214, 252, 948 P.2d 1055, 1093 (1997), as

The Probate Court found: 
3. In the Petition, [Rice, Jr.] sought to have the
[2012 Will] admitted to Probate, and to have himself,
[Rice, Jr.] appointed as Personal Representative of theDecedent's Estate. 
4. The [2012 Will] was submitted to the Court. 
. . . . 
10. In the Objection, [Burgess and Wong] oppose the
Petition on the basis that the Decedent allegedly executedanother Will dated August 31, 2015. . . . 
. . . . 
12. The [2015 Will], however, had not been submitted
to the Court for Probate. 
. . . . 
18. [On] July 28, 2017 in [a related civil lawsuit]
[Burgess and Wong], for the first time, produced andattached copies of the purported [2015 Will]. 
. . . . 
20. At the hearing before this Court on November 30,
2017, [Burgess and Wong] . . . represented that they wouldpresent the August 31, 2017 [sic] Will to the Court forProbate pursuant to an appropriate Petition. 
21. The Court continued the matter to allow [Burgess
and Wong] time to submit their own Petition for Probate ofWill and Appointment of Personal Representative(s) andencouraged the parties to talk with each other about theissues. 
22. The hearing on [Rice, Jr.]'s Petition was
continued to February 8, 2018 before this Court. 
and conclusions[.] 
A copy of the Probate Court's Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law wasappended to the opening brief, but the brief did not specify which findings orconclusions Wong and Burgess contend were erroneous. 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
23. As of the February 8, 2018 hearing, [Burgess and
Wong] had not submitted the [2015 Will] to the Court nor had
they filed a Petition for Probate of Will and Appointment ofPersonal Representative. 
24. At the February 8, 2018 hearing, [Burgess and
Wong requested] a continuance due to settlement discussionsthat had been initiated [in the related civil lawsuit]. 
. . . . 
26. [Rice, Jr.] confirmed that there had been a
settlement conference in relation to the [related civillawsuit] recently, however, he did not agree that theparties were close to settlement.  No further conference had been scheduled and the Probate of will and appointment ofPersonal Representative were points of major contention inthe talks. 
27. [Rice, Jr.] asked for the Petition to be
partially granted as to the appointment of a PersonalRepresentative and that further settlement discussions couldstill be had in the Civil Case. 
28. [Counsel for Burgess and Wong] represented that
he had no authorization on behalf of the Interested Parties as he was only making a special appearance for counsel butreiterated his request for a further continuance. 
29. The Court denied the request for a further
continuance and granted the Petition in all respects. 
The Probate Court also made the following conclusions of law, 
which are actually findings of fact: 
4. The [2015 Will] was not submitted to the Court
for probate or other action, pursuant to a Petition for
Probate of Will and Appointment of PersonalRepresentative(s), even though [Burgess and Wong] hadpreviously represented to the Court that they would. 
5. [Burgess and Wong] had ample time and
opportunity to submit the [2015 Will] to the Court forProbate or other action. 
6. The Court exercised its discretion in denying
the request for an additional continuance. 
It is uncontested that Burgess and Wong "had ample time 
and opportunity to submit" the 2015 Will to probate after they 
"previously represented to the [Probate] Court that they would." Under the circumstances of this case, we cannot conclude that the Probate Court abused its discretion by denying Burgess's and Wong's request for a continuance of the hearing on Rice, Jr.'s 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Petition.  The alleged 2015 Will was never submitted to the 
Probate Court.  The 2012 Will was the only will in probate.  The Probate Court did not err by granting the Petition. 
Based on the foregoing, the "Order Granting Petition 
for Probate of Will and Appointment of Personal Representative" entered by the Probate Court on March 7, 2018, and the "Judgment Pursuant to Order Granting Petition for Probate of Will and Appointment of Personal Representative" entered by the Probate Court on February 20, 2019, are affirmed.
