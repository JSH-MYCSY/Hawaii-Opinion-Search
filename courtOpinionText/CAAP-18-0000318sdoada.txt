  "We review the family court's final division and 
distribution of the estate of the parties under the abuse of 
discretion standard, in view of the factors set forth in Hawai ‘i 
Revised Statutes ( HRS
) § 580-47 and partnership principles." 
Selvage v. Moire, 139 Hawai ‘i 499, 506-07, 394 P.3d 729, 736-37 
(2017) (cleaned up). A family court's FOFs "are reviewed under 
the clearly erroneous standard, while the court's [COLs] are reviewed de novo under the right/wrong standard." Gordon v.
Gordon, 135 Hawai ‘i 340, 348, 350 P.3d 1008, 1016 (2015) 
(citation omitted). Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve Strauss's contentions as follows, and vacate and remand. 
The Family Court did not deviate from the partnership
model. 
  Strauss argues that "[u]nder the partnership model" 
applied by 
Hawai ‘i courts, "a partner is entitled to appropriate 
credit for payment of marital debts such as mortgages, debts, 
and credit cards." Strauss contends that the Family Court "fail[ed] to identify or provide any basis and/or analysis to deviate" from the marital partnership model, with regard to the credits sought by Strauss.  
3   " Hawai ‘i case law follows a framework based on 
partnership principles that provides guidance for family courts in dividing marital partnership property." Id. at 349, 350 
P.3d at 1017 (citations omitted). Hawai ‘i courts use five 
categories to assign values to marital partnership property to 
determine the equitable division and distribution of property between spouses, and Category 5 is at issue here. Id.
"Category 5 includes the net market value of the remaining        
 
   
 
  
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
marital estate at the conclusion of the evidentiary part of the 
trial." Id. (citation omitted). "The value of Category 5, which is the net profit or loss of the marital partnership after deducting the other four categories, is to be divided 
equally unless equitable considerations merit deviation." Id.
at 350, 350 P.3d at 1018 (citation omitted). "In other words, 
the value[ ] of . . . Category 5 [is] awarded one-half to each spouse absent equitable considerations justifying deviation from a 50/50 distribution." Id. (citation omitted). 
Here, the record reflects that the Family Court used 
a "Muraoka" Chart,
5 to show how the equalization payment was 
calculated. The chart reflects that the Family Court treated all assets and debts in the chart as Category 5 marital partnership property.
6 The Family Court calculated the net 
market value of the marital partnership to be $167,285.01, and divided that amount in half to $83,642.51. The Family Court calculated Strauss's net worth as $131,357.00, and Dierdorff's 
net worth as $35,928.01, resulting in Strauss owing an 
equalization payment of $47,724.50. There was no evidence presented, and Strauss does not point to any on appeal, that any agreement existed between the parties regarding the payments Strauss made during the separation. "[I]f there is no agreement between the [spouses] defining the respective 
property interests, partnership principles dictate an equal 
division of the marital estate 'where the only facts proved are the marriage itself and the existence of jointly owned 
5 What the Family Court referred to as a "Muraoka" Chart appears
to be a Property Division Chart. In Muraoka v. Muraoka, 7 Haw. App. 432,
438-39, 776 P.2d 418, 422-23 (1989), this court was unable to review whetherthe family court abused its discretion in the division and distribution ofthe assets and debts of the parties, and directed that the family courtclearly outline the distribution and division of the property. 
6 Strauss does not dispute that there was premarital separate
property or property acquired by gift or inheritance during the marriage.

property.'" Gordon, 135 Hawai ‘i at 350, 350 P.3d at 1018 
(quoting Helbush v. Helbush, 108 
Hawai ‘i 508, 513, 122 P.3d 288, 
293 (App. 2005)). Thus, the Family Court did not "deviate" 
from the marital partnership model, when it awarded one-half of 
the net market value of the partnership property, and found no agreement between Strauss and Dierdorff regarding the payments Strauss made during their separation. See id. Thus, FOFs 8, 9, and 10 were not clearly erroneous. Id. at 348, 350 P.3d at 1016. 
The Family Court's failure to identify and analyze
whether any equitable considerations existed to
justify a deviation from the partnership model
constituted an abuse of discretion. 
Strauss argues that the Family Court "abused its 
discretion . . . by failing to credit" Strauss for the 
various payments Strauss made when it made "no finding to 
deviate from marital partnership principles." 
A family court must follow the steps set forth 
under the partnership model of property division to determine whether to grant a deviation: 
The partnership model requires the family court to first
find all of the facts necessary for categorization of theproperties and assignment of the relevant net marketvalues. Second, the court must identify any equitableconsiderations justifying deviation from an equal
distribution. Third, the court must decide whether or not
there will be a deviation, and in its fourth step, thecourt decides the extent of any deviation. 
Selvage, 139 Hawai ‘i at 509, 394 P.3d at 739 (emphases added) 
(quoting Gordon, 135 Hawai ‘i at 350, 350 P.3d at 1018). In 
Selvage, the Hawai ‘i Supreme Court remanded the case back to the 
family court because despite the appellant's request for a 
deviation, the record was silent as to whether the family court considered any equitable considerations that may have justified 
5        
 
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
a deviation from the equal distribution. Id. (holding that the 
"family court failed to comply with the second part of the Gordon analysis"). The supreme court explained that when determining whether a deviation is warranted, a family court 
must consider "[t]he respective merits of the parties, the 
relative abilities of the parties, the condition in which each party will be left by the divorce, . . . and all other circumstances of the case." Id. at 509-10, 394 P.3d at 739-40 
(citation omitted); see HRS § 580-47(a) (2018) (court shall consider the "condition in which each party will be left by the 
divorce"). 
Here, the record reflects that Strauss requested 
credits for various categories of payments he made during the 
separation, for the marital home, expenses for their daughter, and to Dierdorff. These credits, if allowed by the Family Court, would necessitate a deviation from the equal distribution under the marital partnership model. Dierdorff 
argued below that Strauss "has the ability to be a higher wage 
earner" and that she "survives month to month in a service industry that fluctuates." Strauss, however, testified that he modified his work hours to "half time" due to significant health issues. According to the Property Division Chart, after the current equal property division, Strauss would be left with 
greater debt, and illiquid assets, namely the house, which 
Dierdorff noted has "deferred maintenance issues . . . ." COLs 5 and 6 reflect the Family Court rejected Strauss's request for a deviation, but do not reflect whether the Family Court identified and analyzed any equitable considerations to determine whether a deviation from equal distribution was 
warranted. See Selvage

739-41; Hamilton v. Hamilton, 138 Hawai ‘i 185, 205, 378 P.3d 
901, 921 (2016) (remanding where family court "could have found 
equitable considerations justifying departure from an equal 
distribution of partnership property" where one spouse "had 
virtually no assets and would be left without a home"). 
We 
thus conclude that the Family Court abused its discretion in this regard. 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the (1) January 
30, 2018 "Findings of Facts [sic] and Conclusions of Law; Order and Exhibit A"; and (2) March 12, 2018 "Decree Granting 
Absolute Divorce," both filed and entered by the Family Court 
of the Third Circuit. We remand for further proceedings consistent with this order.
