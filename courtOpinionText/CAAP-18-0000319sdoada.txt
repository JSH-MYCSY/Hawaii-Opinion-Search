STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v. 
BOBBY D. BRAZAN, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1DCW-17-0003024) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Bobby D. Brazan (Brazan) was 
convicted of Assault in the Third Degree in violation of Hawaii 
Revised Statutes (HRS
) ยง 707-712(1)(a) (2014).1 He appeals from 
the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order (Judgment) entered 
by the District Court of the First Circuit, # E wa Division 
(
District Court)2 on March 14, 2018. On appeal, Brazan claims 
there was insufficient evidence to convict him of Assault in the 
Third Degree. For the reasons explained below, we affirm the Judgment. 
On August 16, 2017, Brazan was charged by complaint 
with Assault in the Third Degree. The complaint alleged that Brazan assaulted Headley P. Gumbs (Gumbs) on February 19, 2016. 
1 HRS ยง 707-712 provides, in relevant part: 
(1) A person commits the offense of assault in the
third degree if the person: 
(a) Intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causes
bodily injury to another person[.] 
2 The Honorable Darolyn H. Lendio presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Brazan pleaded not guilty. A jury-waived trial was conducted on 
March 14, 2018. 
Gumbs was the State's only witness. He testified that 
on February 19, 2016, at about 11:00 p.m., he went to his girlfriend's house in Waipahu, parked his vehicle, and walked toward the gate. Brazan pulled up in a vehicle and blocked him in. Brazan began cursing and kicked the back of Gumbs' leg. Brazen accused Gumbs: "You know, you telling somebody that I have AIDS." Gumbs tried to return to his vehicle. Brazan followed him, trying to hit and scratch his neck. Gumbs got into his vehicle but Brazan tried to climb through the open driver's window to take the keys. Gumbs sprained his finger trying to block Brazan from taking his keys. Brazan punched Gumbs in the neck. 
Brazan testified on his own behalf. He said he was in 
his house sleeping at 11:00 p.m. on February 19, 2016. He called Gumbs "a pathological liar." 
The District Court ruled: 
The court in consideration of the testimony of both
witnesses does find Mr. Gumbs credible, although the
defendant does deny categorically that the incident everoccurred. Therefore, the court does find there wassufficient evidence to sustain a conviction for assault in the third degree, that there was intentional, knowing, orreckless behavior on behalf of the defendant which caused bodily injury to the complaining witness. So therefore, thecourt does find the defendant guilty. 
This appeal followed. 
In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to
support the conviction the appellate court must take thatview of the evidence with inferences reasonably andjustifiably to be drawn therefrom most favorable to theGovernment, without weighing the evidence or determining thecredibility of the witnesses. The test on appeal is notwhether guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt, butwhether there was substantial evidence to support theconclusion of the trier of fact.

(citations, brackets and quotation marks omitted). 
In this case 
Gumbs' testimony, viewed in the light most favorable to the

State, substantially supported the District Court's finding. The 
Judgment is affirmed.
