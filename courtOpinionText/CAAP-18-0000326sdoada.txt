APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 1CC111000375) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
Defendants-Appellants Joseph Kalanui Kalahiki, Jr. and 
Merrille Kanoelani Kalahiki (the 
Kalahikis
) appeal from the
"Judgment" and the "Judgment for Possession" in favor of 
Plaintiff-Appellee Aurora Loan Services, LLC, both entered by the 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit on March 13, 2018.1 For the 
reasons explained below, we vacate the Judgment and the Judgment 
for Possession and remand for further proceedings. 
The Kalahikis owned a home in Moanalua on the island of 
O#ahu (the Property). The Property was registered on land court 
certificate no. 482803. The Property secured a 
Note and Mortgage 
1 The Honorable Jeannette H. Castagnetti presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 given by the Kalahikis to Benchmark Lending Group, Inc. 
Benchmark assigned the Mortgage to Aurora. The Kalahikis 
defaulted on the Note. Aurora completed a nonjudicial foreclosure of the Property. The Property was conveyed to Aurora by Quitclaim Deed recorded in Land Court on January 18, 2011. 
Aurora then filed the action below, seeking to eject 
the Kalahikis from the Property. Aurora filed a motion for summary judgment (MSJ). The MSJ was heard on November 22, 2017. 
An order granting the MSJ, the Judgment, a writ of possession, 
and the Judgment for Possession were entered on March 13, 2018. This appeal followed. 
The Kalahikis contend that the circuit court erred by 
granting Aurora's MSJ because: (1) Aurora "failed to establish 
that it had unimpeachable title to the" Property; (2) Aurora 
"failed to show that, in exercising [its] alleged right to non-
judicial foreclosure under a power of sale, [it] exercised this alleged right in a manner that is fair, reasonably diligent, and in good faith, and [it] also failed to demonstrate that an adequate price was procured for the property"; and (3) Aurora 
"has not adequately addressed the issue that the subject mortgage 
was assigned to [Aurora] through fraudulent action." 
We review a circuit court's grant of summary judgment 
de novo using the same standard applied by the circuit court. Nozawa v. Operating Eng'rs Loc. Union No. 3, 142 Hawai# i 331, 
338, 418 P.3d 1187, 1194 (2018). 
Summary judgment is appropriate 
if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Id. at 342, 418 P.3d at 1198. 
(1) Aurora submitted a copy of Certificate of Title 
No. 1010531 (the 
New Certificate) in support of its MSJ. If the 
New Certificate was properly before the circuit court, Aurora's title to the Property would be "conclusive and unimpeachable." 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Aames Funding Corp. v. Mores, 107 Hawai# i 95, 102-03, 110 P.3d 
1042, 1049-50 (2005). 
The Kalahikis objected to the New Certificate because 
the document did not bear the seal of the land court. The 
circuit court did not rule on the objection. Aurora also asked that the circuit court take judicial notice of the New Certificate. The circuit court did not rule on Aurora's request. 
The Kalahikis' objection to the New Certificate had 
merit. HRS § 501-88 (2006) provides: 
The original certificate in the registration book, and any
copy thereof duly certified under the signature of theregistrar or assistant registrar, and the seal of the [land]
court , shall be received as evidence in all the courts of
the State and shall be conclusive as to all matters contained therein, except as otherwise provided in thischapter. 
(Emphasis added.) The document proffered by Aurora did not bear 
the seal of the land court. It was not admissible under HRS § 501-88. 
Nor would it have been appropriate for the circuit 
court to have taken judicial notice of the New Certificate. In Wells Fargo Bank v. Omiya, 142 Hawai# i 439, 420 P.3d 370 (2018) 
the supreme court noted: 
HRS § 501-75 expressly provides that an original certificate
of title "shall be signed by the assistant registrar andsealed with the seal of the court ," and, as stated, new
certificates of title "shall be in like form" to the original certificate. HRS § 501-83. 
Id. at 451 n.20, 420 P.3d at 382 n.20. Hawaii Rules of Evidence 
Rule 201(d) (2016) provides that "[a] court shall take judicial notice if requested by a party and supplied with the necessary 
information." (Emphasis added.) Aurora did not provide the 
circuit court with the information necessary to take judicial 
notice — that is, a copy of the New Certificate sealed with the seal of the land court. 
Aurora did not establish that it had "conclusive and 
unimpeachable" title to the Property.

(2) The action below was one for ejectment. To 
maintain an ejectment action, the plaintiff must prove that it 
has "the title to and right of possession of" the property at issue, and that "possession is unlawfully withheld by another." Kondaur Cap. Corp. v. Matsuyoshi, 136 Hawai# i 227, 241, 361 P.3d 
454, 468 (2015) (citations omitted). 
To establish it had title to the Property, Aurora also 
submitted a copy of the Quitclaim Deed. The Quitclaim Deed resulted from a nonjudicial foreclosure. Thus, Aurora had to show that the foreclosure sale "was fairly conducted and resulted in an adequate price under the circumstances." Omiya, 142 
Hawai# i at 457 n.37, 420 P.3d at 388 n.37 (quoting Hungate v. L. 
Off. of David B. Rosen, 139 Hawai# i 394, 409, 391 P.3d 1, 16 
(2017) (citing Kondaur, 136 Hawai# i at 240-42, 361 P.3d at 467-
69)). 
In support of its motion, Aurora submitted the 
"Mortgagee's Affidavit of Foreclosure Sale Under Power of Sale" 
filed in the land court. The Affidavit of Foreclosure Sale 
purported to describe the circumstances of the foreclosure auction: 
Upon the scheduled date, time and place, the sale was
conducted and the subject mortgaged property declared soldto Aurora Loan Services, LLC, a Delaware Limited LiabilityCompany, or its nominee, for $759,658.79, which was thehighest bid at said sale. 
In opposition to Aurora's motion, Merrille Kalahiki 
submitted a declaration stating (among other things) that the 
real property tax assessed value of the Property was "approximately $1,000,000[.]" 
The supreme court has held: 
We further clarify that the mortgagee's duty to seek
the best price under the circumstances does not require the
mortgagee to obtain the fair market value of the property.Indeed, many commentators have observed that the foreclosureprocess commonly fails to produce the fair market value forforeclosed real estate. There are several reasons whyforeclosure sales fail to attract fair market value bids,such as the difficulty in inspecting the subject properties, 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
technical publication notices, marketable title concerns,
and the lack of a willing seller. While final bids on foreclosed property need not equate to fair market values,the mortgagee nonetheless has a duty to use fair andreasonable means to conduct the foreclosure sale in a manner that is conducive to obtaining the best price under thecircumstances. 
Hungate, 139 Hawai# i at 408-09, 391 P.3d at 15-16 (cleaned up). 
Aurora offered none of the information mentioned by the 
supreme court to show that its nonjudicial foreclosure was fairly 
conducted and resulted in an adequate price under the circumstances. On the record before us, there was a genuine issue of material fact about whether the nonjudicial foreclosure was fairly conducted and resulted in an adequate price under the circumstances. The circuit court thus erred by granting Aurora's MSJ.

(3) The Kalahikis argue that Benchmark assigned the 
Mortgage to Aurora "through fraudulent action." They cite no evidence in the record to support their contention of fraud;
3 
they rely solely upon "information and belief." 
Moreover, as mortgagors, the Kalahikis lack standing to 
challenge the validity of the assignment. "Typically, borrowers do not have standing to challenge the validity of an assignment of its [sic] loans because they are not parties to the [assignment] agreement and because noncompliance with a[n assignee] trust's governing document is irrelevant to the assignee's standing to foreclose." U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n v. 
Salvacion, 134 Hawai# i 170, 175, 338 P.3d 1185, 1190 (App. 2014) 
(citations omitted). 
2 We express no opinion about whether, if Aurora establishes on
remand that a new certificate of title was issued based upon the Quitclaim
Deed, it need still show that the nonjudicial foreclosure was fairly conductedand resulted in an adequate price under the circumstances. See Omiya
, 142
Hawai #i at 449, 420 P.3d at 380 ("[A] mortgagor's right to directly impeach a
foreclosure proceeding is 'expressly limited to the period before entry of anew certificate of title.'") (quoting 
Aames
, 107 Hawai #i at 101, 110 P.3d at
1048). 
3 Fraud must be proved by "clear and convincing evidence." Hancock 
v. Kulana Partners
, 145 Hawai #i 374, 377 n.3, 452 P.3d 371, 374 n.3 (2019) 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
For the foregoing reasons, the Judgment and the 
Judgment for Possession, both entered by the circuit court on 
March 13, 2018, are vacated, and this case is remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this summary disposition order.
