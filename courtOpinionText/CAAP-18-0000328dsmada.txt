IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
NORMAN KARL DOMINGCIL ACUPAN and MARISA CLAIRE IHARA VALENCIANO,
Plaintiffs-Appellees, v. MILISAV MICHELE NEDELJKOVIC;
JOHN DOES 1-10; JANE DOES 1-10; DOE PARTNERSHIPS 1-10;
DOE CORPORATIONS 1-10; AND DOE GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES 1-10,
Defendant/Third-Party Plaintiff/Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 16-1-0005) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: 
Reifurth, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Upon review of (1) Defendant/Third-Party Plaintiff/ 
Appellant Milisav Michele Nedeljkovic's ("Nedeljkovic") appeal 
from the Honorable Gary W.B. Chang's March 13, 2018 "Order 
Denying Defendant Milisav M. Nedeljkovic's Motion to Set Aside 
Default Judgment" in the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit Civil 
No. 16-1-00005 (GWBC), and (2) the record, it appears that we 
lack appellate jurisdiction because the circuit court has not yet 
entered a final judgment that resolves all claims as to all 
parties. 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-1(a) (2016) 
authorizes appeals from circuit courts to the Hawai# i 
Intermediate Court of Appeals from "final judgments, orders, or decrees[.]" 
(Emphasis added). Appeals under HRS ยง 641-1 "shall 
be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS ยง 641-1(c). The Supreme Court of Hawai# i has adopted Rule 58 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of the Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP), which requires 
that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate 
document." 
HRCP Rule 58 (emphasis added). Based on this 
requirement under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai# i has 
held that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders 
have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered 
in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to 
HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 
Hawai# i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). In other words, 
"based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has 
been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 
119 Hawai# i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008). 
Although the circuit court entered a January 6, 2017 
order granting Plaintiffs-Appellees Norman Karl Domingcil Acupan 
and Marisa Claire Ihara Valenciano's motion for default judgment 
against Nedeljkovic, the circuit court never reduced the January 
6, 2017 order to a separate judgment document. Under analogous 
circumstances, the Supreme Court of Hawai# i held that, "[a]bsent 
an underlying appealable final judgment, the circuit court's rulings on a purported Rule 60(b) motion are interlocutory and 
not appealable until entry of such a judgment." 
Bailey v. 
DuVauchelle, 135 Hawai# i 482, 491, 353 P.3d 1024, 1033 (2015). 
Similarly in the instant case, in the absence of an underlying 
appealable final judgment, the circuit court's subsequent 
March 13, 2018 "Order Denying Defendant Milisav M. Nedeljkovic's 
Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment" is not an appealable post-
judgment order, but, instead, is an interlocutory order that will 
eventually be eligible for appellate review by way of a timely 
appeal from a future appealable final judgment under the 
principle that "[a]n appeal from a final judgment brings up for 
review all interlocutory orders not appealable directly as of 
right which deal with issues in the case." Ueoka v Szymanski, 
107 Hawai# i 386, 396, 114 P.3d 892, 902 (2005) (citation and 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
internal quotation marks omitted). Absent an appealable final 
judgment, we lack appellate jurisdiction. 
The record on appeal in the instant case indicates 
that the Circuit Court has not yet resolved all claims against 
all parties and, instead, the Circuit Court granted Nedeljkovic 
leave to file his April 26, 2018 third-party complaint that 
asserts seven separate counts against Third-Party 
Defendant/Appellee All Islands, Inc., dba Century 21 All Islands, 
which remains pending and unresolved before the Circuit Court in 
Civil No. 16-1-00005 (GWBC). In the absence of finality, a 
temporary remand is unwarranted, and Nedeljkovic's appeal is 
premature. 
See, Waikiki v. Ho# omaka Village Association of 
Apartment Owners, 140 Hawai
#i 197, 204, 398 P.3d 786, 793 (2017). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court 
case number CAAP-18-0000328 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
