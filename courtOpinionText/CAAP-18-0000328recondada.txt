DOE CORPORATIONS 1-10; AND DOE GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES 1-10, 
Defendant/Third-Party Plaintiff/Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 16-1-0005)
ORDER DENYING THE MARCH 11, 2019 MOTION
TO RECONSIDER THE MARCH 11, 2019 ORDER
DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By:  Reifurth, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.)
Upon review of (1) the March 11, 2019 order dismissing
appellate court case number CAAP-18-0000328 for lack of appellate
jurisdiction, (2) Defendant/Third-Party Plaintiff/Appellant
Milisav Michele Nedeljkovic's ("Nedeljkovic") March 11, 2019
motion to reconsider the March 11, 2019 dismissal order pursuant
to Rule 40 of the Hawaii # Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP),
and (3) the record, it appears that we did not overlook or
misapprehend any points of law or fact when we entered the
May 11, 2019 dismissal order.
In support of Nedeljkovic's March 11, 2019 HRAP Rule 40
motion for reconsideration, Nedeljkovic argues that the order
that he is appealing implicates the United States Supreme Court's
holding in Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848), under which NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
appellate courts "have jurisdiction to consider appeals from
judgments which require immediate execution of a command that
property be delivered to the appellant's adversary, and the
losing party would be subjected to irreparable injury if
appellate review had to wait the final outcome of the
litigation."  Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawaii# 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702,
704 (1995) (citations, internal quotation marks and brackets
omitted).  However, the order appealed from in this case, namely
the March 13, 2018 "Order Denying Defendant Milisav M.
Nedeljkovic's Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment," does not
contain language that "require[s] immediate execution of a
command that property be delivered to" Plaintiffs-Appellees
Norman Karl Domingcil Acupan (Acupan) and Marisa Claire Ihara
Valenciano (Valenciano).
Although the circuit court had previously entered a
January 6, 2017 order granting Acupan and Valenciano's motion for
default judgment against Nedeljkovic as to their two-count
complaint, that January 6, 2017 order expressly contemplated the
subsequent entry of a separate "judgment" document for the
purpose of triggering a limited sixty-day time period for
Nedeljkovic to convey the subject property.  The circuit court
never entered the separate judgment, and, thus, the sixty-day
time period for conveying the subject property was never
triggered.
In an order entered nine months later on September 15,
2017, the circuit court granted Acupan and Valenciano access to
the subject property for the mere purpose of inspecting it, not
taking possession of it, and expressly denied Acupan and
Valenciano's request to appoint a commissioner to enforce and
carry out the remedy of specific performance.  Nedeljkovic has
apparently not yet surrendered possession of the subject
property, nor has the circuit court directed Nedeljkovic to do so
on a date certain in the future.
While the record does not reveal why the circuit court
has refrained from entering the separate judgment or a writ of
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
possession relating to the January 6, 2017 order, the record does
reveal that the circuit court has chosen, instead, to grant
Nedeljkovic leave to file his directly-related April 26, 2018
third-party complaint that asserts seven separate counts against
Third-Party Defendant/Appellee All Islands, Inc., dba Century 21
All Islands (All Islands), all of which remain pending and
unresolved before the Circuit Court.  Regardless of the circuit
court's rationale for proceeding as it has, the Forgay doctrine
does not appear to apply to any order in this case, including the
appealed March 13, 2018 "Order Denying Defendant Milisav M.
Nedeljkovic's Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment."  In the
absence of a final judgment that resolves all claims as to all
parties, Nedeljkovic's appeal is premature.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Nedeljkovic's
March 11, 2019 motion for reconsideration of the March 11, 2019
dismissal order is denied.
