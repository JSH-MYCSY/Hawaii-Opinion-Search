NO. CAAP-18-0000342
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
FRED E. HOFER, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 3DTI-17-033614)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
appellate jurisdiction under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 
§ 641-1(a) (2016).
 
Defendant-Appellant Fred Hofer (Hofer) filed a document
 
on April 17, 2018, entitled Notice of Appeal, which we interpret
 to state an appeal from the Honorable Harry P. Freitas's
 April 10, 2018 Order and Notice of Entry of Order (April 10, 2018
Order) that addressed five traffic violations, each of which is
 
punishable by only a fine, and, thus, constitutes a "'[t]raffic
 
infraction' . . . for which the prescribed penalties do not
 include imprisonment[.]" HRS § 291D-2 (2007). Specifically, the
 April 10, 2018 order denied Hofer's request for a hearing on his
 alleged violations that day, and set hearing on the matter for
 May 17, 2018. On May 17, 2018, Hofer appeared, but the matter
 was continued to June 21, 2018 "for Status of Appeal."

"No traffic infraction shall be classified as a 
criminal offense." HRS § 291D-3(a) (2007). Under HRS Chapter 
291D, a district court adjudicates a contested traffic citation pursuant to HRS § 291D-8 (2007) without holding a standard trial, but, if the district court adjudicates the citation in favor of the State, then "[t]he defendant may request a trial pursuant to the Hawaii rules of evidence and rules of the district court[.]" HRS § 291D-13(a) (2007). After the district court enters the resulting judgment on the trial pursuant to HRS § 291D-13, Rule 19(d) of the Hawai' i Civil Traffic Rules provides that 
"[a]ppeals from judgments entered after a trial may be taken in the manner provided for appeals from district court civil judgments." HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals from district court civil judgments: 
Pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a) (1993), appeals are allowed in
civil matters from all final judgments, orders, or decrees
of circuit and district courts. In district court cases, a
judgment includes any order from which an appeal lies. A
 final order means an order ending the proceeding, leaving
nothing further to be accomplished. When a written
 judgment, order, or decree ends the litigation by fully
deciding all rights and liabilities of all parties, leaving
nothing further to be adjudicated, the judgment, order, or
decree is final and appealable.
 
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai' i 425, 426, 984 P.2d 1251, 
1252 (1999) (citations, internal quotation marks, and footnote 
omitted). 
The district court has not yet held the trial pursuant 
to HRS § 291D-13, much less entered a final judgment, in the underlying case. Therefore, the April 10, 2018 Order is an interlocutory order that is not eligible for appellate review until entry of the appealable final judgment. See State v. Adam, 
97 Hawai' i 475, 482, 40 P.3d 877, 884 (2002) ("As a general rule, 
an appeal from a final judgment in a case brings up for review all preceding interlocutory orders in the case." (Citations 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
omitted)).  Hofer's appeal is premature, and we lack jurisdiction
to review the April 10, 2018 Order.1
THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, June 28, 2018.

1"Generally, the filing of a notice of appeal divests the
trial court of jurisdiction over the appealed case."  TSA
International Limited v. Shimizu Corporation, 92 Hawai #i 243,
265, 990 P.2d 713, 735 (1999) (citations omitted).  "The general
rule, however, assumes that the notice of appeal is valid under
the applicable statutory provisions and procedural rules.  Where
the notice of appeal is jurisdictionally defective, filing the
notice does not transfer jurisdiction from the trial court to the
appellate court."  Ontiveros , 82 Hawai #i at 449, 923 P.2d at 391
(citations omitted; emphasis added).  Hence, the district court
did not lose jurisdiction due to Hofer's defective notice of
appeal.
