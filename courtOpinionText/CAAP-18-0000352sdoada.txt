In CAAP-18-0000352 self-represented Petitioner-
Appellant PO (Father) appeals from the "Order Affirming the 
Administrative Findings and Order Filed on December 9, 2016" NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
entered by the Family Court of the Third Circuit1 on March 23, 
2018, in FC-AP No. 17-1-0001 (Appeal No. 1). In CAAP-18-0000353 
Father appeals from the "Order Affirming the Administrative 
Findings and Order Filed on December 9, 2016" entered by the Family Court of the Third Circuit on March 23, 2018, in FC-AP No. 17-1-0002 (Appeal No. 2). We consolidated the appeals on 
March 21, 2019. For the reasons explained below, we affirm both 
orders. 
BACKGROUND 
Child was born in 1992. Appellee JK (Mother) is 
Child's natural mother. Child's birth certificate identified someone other than Father as Child's father. Father believed that he was Child's natural father, and sought to correct Child's birth certificate. He went to the State of Hawai# i Child Support 
Enforcement Agency (CSEA
) for assistance. 
On July 28, 1994, Father submitted a CSEA Application 
Form. He identified himself as the "Absent Parent" and Mother as the "Custodial Parent[.]" The form stated: 
I understand that I, the applicant, if eligible, will be a
recipient of services of the [CSEA], and that the deputiesAttorney General and deputies Corporation Counsel who may beinvolved in my case represent the [CSEA], not me, in anychild support matter. 
I understand that the [CSEA] may pursue . . . current child
support, arrears, and modification of existing child supportorders either administratively or through judicial process.I agree that the decision of how to proceed in my case isthe [CSEA's], not mine. 
. . . . 
In signing this application for Child Support EnforcementServices, I declare under penalty of perjury that I havephysical custody of the following child(ren) for whomservices are sought: [blank]

Mother denied that Father was Child's father. Father 
requested genetic testing for himself and for the person who 
Mother claimed was Child's father. On December 28, 1994, in State, Child Support Enf't Agency v. JK, FC-P No. 94-222 (Paternity Action), the family court entered an order for genetic 
testing. The order stated: 
5. That as Defendant [Father] has requested genetic
testing, but is unable to pay for the entire cost at this
time, the [CSEA], shall advance the entire cost of thegenetic testing fees, to wit: $400.00. Said amount of $400.00 shall be subject to reimbursement by Defendant[Father] at the rate of $25.00 monthly installments with thefirst installment due on December 7, 1994. Defendant [Father] shall make said monthly payments of $25.00 in theform of a cashier's check, certified check or money ordermade payable and sent to the [CSEA.] 
On January 31, 1996, the family court entered "Findings 
of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Judgment" (Judgment of Paternity) 
in the Paternity Action. The family court concluded, based on 
genetic testing, that Father was Child's biological father. The Judgment of Paternity ordered: 
3. That Defendant, [Father], who has a duty to
support [Child], shall pay child support in the amount of
$130.00 per month, by an Order for Income Assignment uponDefendant, [Father], obtaining employment, with the firstpayment commencing June 1995 and continuing until [Child]reaches eighteen (18) years of age, and so long thereafter,including summer months, as [Child] is pursuing a highschool diploma or so long as [Child] continues [their]post-high school education on a full-time basis at anaccredited college or university, or in a vocational ortrade school, or until [Child] attains the age of 23 yearswhichever occurs first, unless [Child] thereto shall die, beadopted, become emancipated or self-supporting, or untilfurther order of the Court; 
4. That all payments shall be made by cashier's
check, certified check or money order made payable and sentto the [CSEA.] 
According to Father, Mother and he agreed that Mother would not
require Father to support Child, but Father was not to be involved in Child's life in any way. Nevertheless, Father did not appeal any of the provisions of the Judgment of Paternity.

child relationship[.]"

On December 9, 2016, CSEA filed findings and orders in 
two administrative proceedings based upon the order for genetic 
testing and the Judgment of Paternity. The order in FC-P No. 94-0222 stated, in relevant part: 
GENETIC FEE TESTING FEES DEBT OWING TO STATE OF HAWAII: 
$400.00 for the period December 7, 1994 through October 31,2016 is owing to the State of Hawaii and JUDGMENT THEREFORIS HEREBY ENTERED. Responsible Parent [Father] shall pay$25.00 per month until said debt is fully satisfied. 
CHILD SUPPORT ARREARAGE OWING TO [JK]:
$2,870.00 for the period January 1, 2008 throughDecember 31, 2009. In addition, a remaining balance of$0.00 is owing for the previously established arrearage. 
Total arrearage is $2,870.00 and JUDGMENT THEREFOR IS HEREBY

PAYMENT AMOUNT : Payment for the obligation(s) addressed in
this order shall be $75.00, per month commencing November 1,

The order in FC-APB No. 10-1-0016 stated, in relevant part: 
CHILD SUPPORT ARREARAGE OWING TO [JK]:$700.00 for the period January 1, 2010 through August 31,2010. In addition, a remaining balance of $19,630.00 is

PAYMENT AMOUNT : Payment for the obligation(s) addressed in
this order shall be $125.00, per month commencing
November 1, 2016. 
Father appealed to the family court from each of the 
administrative orders, creating Appeal No. 1 and Appeal No. 2. 
The family court heard consolidated arguments on February 23, 2018. On March 23, 2018, the family court entered orders affirming the administrative findings and orders in each of the appeals. These secondary appeals followed. 
DISCUSSION 
Father contends that the family court: (1) erred by 
holding CSEA had authority to enforce the child support orders 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
without a request from Mother; (2) violated Rule 72(k) of the 
Hawai# i Family Court Rules (HFCR); and (3) erred by affirming the 
order requiring that Father pay for the genetic testing he 
requested, contrary to 45 C.F.R. § 303.5(e)(3)3. 
Our review of a family court decision on an appeal from 
an administrative agency determination is a secondary appeal; we must determine whether the family court was right or wrong in its decision, applying the standards set forth in Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 91–14(g) (Supp. 2017) to the agency's decision. 
Flores v. Bd. of Land & Nat. Res., 143 Hawai# i 114, 120, 424 P.3d 
469, 475 (2018) (reviewing circuit court agency appeal). HRS 
§ 91–14, entitled "Judicial review of contested cases[,]" provides in relevant part: 
(g) Upon review of the record, the court may
affirm the decision of the agency or remand the case
with instructions for further proceedings; or it mayreverse or modify the decision and order if thesubstantial rights of the petitioners may have beenprejudiced because the administrative findings,conclusions, decisions, or orders are: 
(1) In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; 
(2) In excess of the statutory authority orjurisdiction of the agency; 
(3) Made upon unlawful procedure; 
(4) Affected by other error of law; 
(5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,probative, and substantial evidence on thewhole record; or 
(6) Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterizedby abuse of discretion or clearlyunwarranted exercise of discretion. 
1. CSEA was authorized to enforce the Judgment of Paternity. 
Father contends that HRS Chapter 576E ("Administrative 
Process for Child Support Enforcement") did not authorize CSEA to 
enforce the Judgment of Paternity because Mother did not request 
3 Father actually cites to 45 C.F.R. § 303.5(3), which does not
exist. We construe his argument to be based upon 45 C.F.R. § 303.5(e)(3).

enforcement. He refers to HRS Chapter 576E,  but his argument
cites HRS § 576D-3(b)(3) (2006): 4 
§ 576D-3 Obtaining or enforcing child support.  (a)
The [CSEA] shall undertake any legal or administrative
action to secure support for a child by enforcing anexisting court order or obtaining a court order of support. 
(b) To carry out its responsibilities imposed under
this chapter, the [CSEA], through the offices of thecorporation counsel, the county attorneys, or the attorneygeneral, may commence or appear in any proceeding before anycourt or administrative agency for the purpose ofestablishing paternity for children born out of wedlock orfor the purpose of obtaining, enforcing, or modifying anorder of support on behalf of any dependent or any otherperson for whom the [CSEA] has a duty to obtain or enforcean order for support under this chapter. The [CSEA] maycommence or appear in any action on its own behalf, onbehalf of any dependent child or custodial parent, or onbehalf of any other person for whom the [CSEA] has a duty toobtain or enforce an order of support under this chapter.The [CSEA] shall obtain or enforce a child support order forthe following children: 
(1) A child on whose behalf public assistancepayments have been or are being made; 
(2) A child on whose behalf foster care paymentshave been or are being made under Title IV-E; or 
(3) Any other child, if a parent, guardian, orperson having custody applies to the [CSEA] forassistance in obtaining or enforcing a childsupport order with respect to the child,regardless of whether public assistance paymentshave been made on the child's behalf. 
(Underscoring added.) 
"The interpretation of a statute is a question of law 
which an appellate court reviews de novo." Child Support Enf't 
Agency v. Doe, 88 Hawai# i 159, 165, 963 P.2d 1135, 1141 (App. 
1998) (cleaned up). "When interpreting a statute, our foremost obligation is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the language contained in the statute itself." Id. (cleaned up). 
The plain language of HRS § 576D-3 authorizes CSEA to 
take legal action to enforce court orders such as the Judgment of Paternity in this case. 
As Father points out, HRS § 576D-3(b)(3) 
mandates that CSEA obtain and enforce child support orders upon

attorney general which include the power to enforce the Judgment of Paternity
in this case.

request of a custodial parent. But the statutory authorization 
is not limited to the situations described in HRS § 576D-3(b); HRS § 576D-3(b) authorizes CSEA to commence enforcement actions "on its own behalf." Cf. CSEA v. Doe, 88 Hawai# i at 167, 963 
P.2d at 1143 (noting that CSEA was authorized to obtain child support order even where child was not in need of public assistance). CSEA was authorized to enforce the Judgment of Paternity. 
2. The family court did not
violate HFCR Rule 72(k). 
Father contends that the family court violated HFCR 
Rule 72(k), which governs appeals to the family court. The rule 
provides, in relevant part: 
(a) How taken.  Where a right of appeal to the family
court is allowed by statute, any person or party allowed by
statute may appeal from such decision, order or action byfiling a notice of appeal in the family court havingjurisdiction of the matter. . . . 
. . . . 
(k) Judgment.  Upon determination of the appeal, the
court having jurisdiction shall enter judgment. Such 
judgment shall be reviewable, or final, as may be providedby law. Promptly after final determination of the appeal inthe family court the clerk of the court shall notify theparties and the governmental official or body concerned ofthe disposition of the appeal. 
HFCR Rule 72 applied to Appeal No. 1 and Appeal No. 2, 
both of which were authorized by HRS § 576E-13.5 Upon deter-
mination of the appeals, the family court entered an "Order 
Affirming the Administrative Findings and Order Filed on December 9, 2016" in each case. Although not titled "judgments," the orders finally determined all of the issues in the appeals and thus complied with HFCR Rule 72. 
Father argues that the family court's orders "do[] not 
express any findings and conclusions as to why it affirms" CSEA's findings and orders in the two administrative proceedings. A 
5 HRS § 576E-13 (2006) provides, in relevant part: 
(a) Any party, including the [CSEA], who is aggrieved by a
final decision and order in a contested case . . . is entitled to judicial review under [HRS] chapter 91. 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
family court reviewing an agency decision does not make its own 
findings or conclusions; it reviews the agency's findings and conclusions for error. In a secondary appeal we also review the agency's findings and conclusions, not those of the family court, to determine whether the family court was right or wrong in deciding the primary appeal. "An agency's conclusions of law are reviewed de novo, while an agency's factual findings are reviewed for clear error." Del Monte Fresh Produce (Hawaii), Inc. v. 
International Longshore & Warehouse Union, Local 142, 128 Hawai# i 
289, 302, 287 P.3d 190, 203 (2012). "A court reviewing an agency's decision cannot consider the weight of the evidence to ascertain whether it weighs in favor of the administrative findings, or review the agency's findings of fact by passing upon the credibility of witnesses or conflicts in testimony[.]" Sierra Club v. D.R. Horton-Schuler Homes, LLC
, 136 Hawai# i 505, 
522, 364 P.3d 213, 230 (2015) (cleaned up). The family court's orders affirming CSEA's findings and orders did not violate HFCR Rule 72(k). 
3. The family court did not err by
affirming the order requiring thatFather pay genetic testing fees. 
Father contends that the order requiring him to pay 
genetic testing fees is contrary to 45 C.F.R. § 303.5(e)(3). 
Title 45 of the Code of Federal Regulations provides, in relevant part: 
§ 303.5 Establishment of paternity. 
. . . . 
(e)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this
section, the [CSEA] may charge any individual who is not a
recipient of aid under the State's title IV-A [Block Grantsto States for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families] orXIX [Grants to States for Medical Assistance Programs] plana reasonable fee for performing genetic tests. 
. . . . 
(3) If paternity is established and genetic tests were
ordered by the [CSEA], the [CSEA] must pay the costs of suchtests, subject to recoupment (if the [CSEA] elects) from thealleged father who denied paternity. 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
45 C.F.R. § 303.5 (2016). The statute allows CSEA to recover 
genetic testing costs from a natural father who denied paternity even if the father is a recipient of a federal block grant or medical assistance program. Father did not deny paternity. 45 C.F.R. § 303.5(e)(3) does not apply to Father. 
Under 45 C.F.R. § 303.5(e)(1), CSEA was authorized to 
charge Father, as the party asserting paternity, for the genetic testing fees so long as Father was not a recipient of a federal block grant or medical assistance program. Father did not argue, before the agency or the family court, that he is a federal block grant or medical assistance program recipient. The family court did not err in affirming the agency order requiring that Father pay genetic testing fees. See also HRS § 576E-2(10) (authorizing 
CSEA to "[o]rder genetic testing . . . for the purpose of establishing paternity, with payment of costs to be made by the agency, subject to recoupment by the State from the father . . . if paternity is established . . . [.]") 
CONCLUSION 
Based upon the foregoing, the family court's March 23, 
2018 orders in Appeal No. 1 and Appeal No. 2 affirming the administrative findings and orders filed on December 9, 2016, are affirmed.
