(By: Ginoza, C.J., and Leonard and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
This appeal arises out of a foreclosure decree entered 
by the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit (Circuit Court) against
Defendant-Appellant Dylan Thede (Thede).  On April 3, 2018, the 
Circuit Court entered its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law 
and Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment Against All Defendants and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure (Foreclosure Decree), and the related Judgment 
(Foreclosure Judgment), both in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee U.S. 
Bank National Association, as Trustee for Harbor View Mortgage 
Loan Trust 2005-16, Mortgage Loan Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2005-16 (U.S. Bank), and against Thede and Defendant-

Appellee Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., Solely 
as Nominee for Countrywide Home Loans, Inc.1/ 
Thede appeals from the Foreclosure Decree and the 
Foreclosure Judgment.2/ He contends that the Circuit Court erred 
in granting U.S. Bank's motion for summary judgment and interlocutory decree of foreclosure (MSJ) by relying on "the 
hearsay testimony of U.S. Bank's declaring witnesses" to 
establish U.S. Bank's standing to foreclose on Thede's mortgaged property. 
After reviewing the record on appeal and the relevant 
legal authorities, and giving due consideration to the issues raised and the arguments advanced by the parties, we resolve Thede's contention as follows and vacate and remand. 
I. RELEVANT BACKGROUND 
On April 19, 2012, U.S. Bank filed a Complaint for 
Foreclosure (Complaint) in the Circuit Court.
3/ U.S. Bank 
alleged, among other things, that: (1) on August 10, 2005, Thede obtained a $1,500,000 loan (Loan) from Countrywide Home Loans, 
Inc. (Countrywide), by executing a promissory note (Note), 
secured by a mortgage (Mortgage) recorded with respect to real 
property located at 3657 Anini Rd., Princeville, Hawai# i 96722 
( 
Property); (2) the Mortgage was assigned to U.S. Bank by an 
Assignment of Mortgage recorded on December 8, 2009; (3) Thede 
defaulted under the payment terms of the Note and Mortgage; (4) following written notice to Thede and his failure to cure the default, U.S. Bank exercised its option to accelerate the loan and to declare the entire principal due under the Note and secured by the Mortgage, plus interest, advances, and other 
1/ The Honorable Randal G.B. Valenciano presided. 
2/ Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. did not appeal from
the Foreclosure Judgment and, as presumably a nominal appellee, did not file
an answering brief. See Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure ( HRAP ) Rule
28(c). 
3/ U.S. Bank initially referred to itself as U.S. Bank National
Association, as Trustee for the Benefit of Harborview 2005-16 Trust Fund, buton December 15, 2016, obtained the Circuit Court's permission to change itsname in the caption as currently stated. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
charges, immediately due and payable; and (5) U.S. Bank was 
entitled to foreclose the Mortgage and to sell the Property. 
On October 12, 2017, U.S. Bank filed its MSJ, which 
included an attached "Declaration of Indebtedness and on Prior Business Records." Rebecca C. Wallace (Wallace) signed the 
declaration (Wallace Declaration), "as an authorized signer of 
Nationstar Mortgage LLC ('Nationstar'), which is Plaintiff's 
servicing agent for the subject loan ('the loan')[.]" Wallace declared, among other things, that "Nationstar's records indicate that Plaintiff, by and through Nationstar had possession of the original Note prior to 04/19/2012, the date of the filing of the complaint in this foreclosure." However, Wallace also stated that "Nationstar became Plaintiff's loan servicer for the Loan being foreclosed in this action on 04/01/2014[,]" i.e., nearly two years after the Complaint was filed, and that "[t]he prior loan servicer for this mortgage loan was Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc., N.A. ('Prior Servicer')." 
On November 30, 2017, U.S. Bank filed the "Affidavit of 
Bank of America, N.A. Re: Possession of Note as Prior Servicer." Nichole Renee Williams (Williams) signed the affidavit (Williams
Affidavit), which stated, in relevant part: 
1. I am authorized to sign this Declaration on
behalf of Bank of America, N.A. ("BANA"), which was the
prior servicer for the subject loan (the "Loan"). 
2. As prior servicer, BANA maintained records for
the Loan. As part of my job responsibilities for BANA, I amfamiliar with the type of records that were maintained byBANA in connection with the Loan. As such, I am authorizedto make this Declaration. 
3. The information in this Declaration is taken 
from BANA's business records. I have personal knowledge ofBANA's procedures for creating these records. They are: (a)made at or near the time of the occurrence of the matters recorded by persons with personal knowledge of theinformation in the business record, or from informationtransmitted by persons with personal knowledge; (b) kept inthe course of BANA's regularly conducted businessactivities; and (c) created by BANA as a regular practice. 
4. On 04/19/2012, the Complaint for Foreclosure;
Summons ("Complaint") was filed herein identifying thePlaintiff as U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee, forthe Benefit of Harborview 2005-16 Trust Fund. A true and correct copy of the Complaint is attached hereto as Exhibit"A". 
5. At the time the Complaint was filed, BANA was
the servicer for the Loan. 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
6. On 04/09/2012, BANA was in possession of the
original Adjustable Rate Note dated 08/10/2005 in the
principal amount of $1,500,000.00 executed by DYLAN THEDE infavor of Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., endorsed in blank("Note"). A true and correct copy of the Note is attachedas Exhibit "B". 
On December 6, 2017, Thede filed a memorandum in 
opposition to U.S. Bank's motion for summary judgment. He argued
that U.S. Bank offered no admissible evidence that it possessed the Note when the Complaint was filed, and thus failed to establish its standing to foreclose under Bank of America, N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai# i 361, 390 P.3d 1248 (2017). In 
particular, Thede argued that the Wallace Declaration: (1) did not establish Wallace's personal knowledge of her assertion that U.S. Bank, through Nationstar, had possession of the Note prior to the filing of the Complaint; and (2) made contradictory statements in asserting that Nationstar had possession of the Note before it became U.S. Bank's servicer.  
On February 6, 2018, U.S. Bank filed a supplemental 
declaration in support of its MSJ. Christy Vieau (Vieau) signed
the declaration (Vieau Declaration), which stated, in relevant 
part:  
1. I am authorized to sign this Declaration on
behalf of Plaintiff U.S. BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, AS
TRUSTEE FOR HARBORVIEW MORTGAGE LOAN TRUST 2005-16, MORTGAGELOAN PASS-THROUGH CERTIFICATES, SERIES 2005-16 ("Plaintiff")as an authorized signer of Nationstar Mortgage, LLC("Nationstar"), which is Plaintiff's servicing agent for thesubject loan ("the Loan"). 
2. Nationstar maintains records for the loan in its 
capacity as Plaintiff's servicer. As part of my jobresponsibilities for Nationstar, I am familiar with the typeof records maintained by Nationstar in connection with theLoan. As such, I am authorized to make this Declaration insupport of Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment AgainstAll Defendants and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosurefiled on 10/12/2017. 
3. Nationstar is the Plaintiff and current loan 
servicer, and acts as the exclusive representative and agentof Plaintiff in the servicing and administering of mortgageloans referred to Nationstar, including the Loan beingforeclosed in this action. 
4. The information in this Declaration is taken 
from Nationstar's business records, I have personalknowledge of Nationstar's procedures for creating theserecords. They are: (a) made at or near the time of theoccurrence of the matters recorded by persons with personalknowledge of the information in the business record, or frominformation transmitted by persons with personal knowledge;(b) kept in the course of Nationstar's regularly conducted 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
business activities; and (c) created by Nationstar as
regular practice. 
5. On 04/19/2012, the Complaint for Foreclosure
("Complaint") was filed herein identifying the Plaintiffs asU.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee, for the benfit[sic] of Harborview 2005-16 Trust Fund. 
6. At the time the Complaint for Foreclosure was
filed, Bank of America, N.A. ("BANA") was the servicer forthe Loan. 
7. Based on the affidavit executed by Nichole Renee
Williams on 11/09/2017 as an authorized representative ofBANA ("Affidavit"), BANA was in possession of the originalAdjustable Rate Note dated 08/10/2015 in the principalamount of $1,500,000.00 executed by Defendant DYLAN THEDE infavor of Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., endorsed in blank("Original Note"), when the Complaint was filed. Attached hereto as Exhibit "9" is a true and correct filed copy ofBANA's Affidvit. 
8. On 12/01/2012, servicing of the Loan was
transferred from BANA to Select Portfolio Servicing Inc.("SPS"). On 04/01/2014, the subject Loan was furthertransferred to Nationstar. As a result of the service transfer, Plaintiff was substituted as the real party ininterest on 12/15/2016. 
Vieau further stated: 
12. In reviewing the records from BANA and SPS which
were incorporated into Nationstar's own business records,Nationstar clarifies that Plaintiff at the time of the Complaint for Foreclosure was filed on 04/19/2012 hadpossession of the Original Note, by and through BANA. 
On February 14, 2018, Thede filed a supplemental 
memorandum opposing U.S. Bank's MSJ and addressing the Williams 
Affidavit. Thede argued, among other things, that Williams's testimony: (1) contradicted the Wallace Declaration, creating a genuine issue of material fact as to who U.S. Bank's servicer wasand who was in possession of the Note when the Complaint was filed; and (2) was not based on Williams's personal knowledge that BANA possessed the Note when the Complaint was filed, and constituted inadmissible hearsay.  
On February 16, 2018, U.S. Bank filed a reply 
memorandum in support of its motion for summary judgment. 
Following a February 22, 2018 hearing on U.S. Bank's 
motion for summary judgment, on April 3, 2018, the Circuit Courtentered the Foreclosure Decree and the Foreclosure Judgment. Thede filed a timely notice of appeal.  
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
II. DISCUSSION 
In Reyes-Toledo, the Hawai# i Supreme Court held that to 
establish the right to foreclose, the foreclosing plaintiff must 
establish standing, or entitlement to enforce the subject promissory note, at the time the action was commenced. 139 Hawai
#i at 367-70, 390 P.3d at 1254-57. The "foreclosing 
plaintiff's burden to prove entitlement to enforce the note overlaps with the requirements of standing in foreclosure actions as '[s]tanding is concerned with whether the parties have the right to bring suit.'" Id. at 367, 390 P.3d at 1254 (quoting 
Mottl v. Miyahira, 95 Hawai# i 381, 388, 23 P.3d 716, 723 (2001)). 
The supreme court further noted that "a foreclosing plaintiff does not have standing to foreclose on mortgaged property unless the plaintiff was entitled to enforce the note that has been defaulted on." Id. at 368, 390 P.3d at 1255 (citing Hanalei, BRC 
Inc. v. Porter
, 7 Haw. App. 304, 310, 760 P.2d 676, 680 (1988)). 
Here, it appears that the Circuit Court granted U.S. 
Bank's MSJ based in part on the copy of the "Adjustable Rate Note" that was attached to the Williams Affidavit and the Vieau and Wallace Declarations (Attached Note). At the February 22, 
2018 hearing, the court stated: 
So in this particular case regarding the Reyes-Toledo
issue, the Court believes that given the Court's review of
the documents, there's sufficient evidence to show that atthe time of the complaint, the parties –- the plaintiffs orthe plaintiff's predecessor in interest had possession ofthe documents, and so that would satisfy Reyes-Toledo. 
As far as other qualified witness, the Court believes
that the declarants or affiants had sufficient information and were in a sufficient position to make the allegationsthat they made and I'm not -– I'm not ruling that in makingtheir declarations, that you need to attach –- like, youknow, when they say I reviewed the business records, theydon't have to attach all of the business records theyreviewed. That would be an onerous obligation, from thisCourt's perspective. 
So what the court will do is the Court will grant the
motion for summary judgment. 
Thede contends that the Circuit Court erred in granting
U.S. Bank's MSJ by relying on "the hearsay testimony of U.S. 
Bank's declaring witnesses" to establish U.S. Bank's standing to foreclose. Thede also argues that U.S. Bank offered "no admissible evidence" that it possessed the Note when the  
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Complaint was filed. 
"Under Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 56(e) 
(2000) and Rules of the Circuit Courts of the State of Hawai
#i 
Rule 7(g) (1997), 'a declaration [or affidavit] in support of a 
summary judgment motion must be based on personal knowledge, contain facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show that the declarant [or affiant] is competent to testify as to the matters contained within the declaration.'" Wells Fargo Bank, 
N.A. v. Behrendt, 142 Hawai# i 37, 44, 414 P.3d 89, 96 (2018) 
(quoting U.S. Bank N.A. v. Mattos, 140 Hawai# i 26, 30, 398 P.3d 
615, 619 (2017)). "Inadmissible evidence 'cannot serve as a basis for awarding or denying summary judgment.'" 
Id. (quoting 
Haw. Cmty. Fed. Credit Union v. Keka
, 94 Hawai# i 213, 221, 11 
P.3d 1, 9 (2000)). 
U.S. Bank contends that the Attached Note was 
admissible under the hearsay exception for records of regularly conducted activity pursuant to Hawai# i Rules of Evidence (HRE) 
Rule 803(b)(6).
4/ U.S. Bank further argues that Williams, Vieau, 
and Wallace were each a "qualified witness" with respect to the Attached Note, and each satisfied the standards set out in Mattos for admitting that document into evidence and establishing U.S. Bank's standing to foreclose. 
In Mattos and Behrendt, the supreme court reviewed the 
sufficiency of declarations similar in certain key respects to those at issue here, each of which attested to a promissory note and other documents relating to a foreclosure under the HRE Rule 803(b)(6) business records exception. See Mattos, 140 Hawai# i at 
31, 398 P.3d at 620; Behrendt, 142 Hawai# i at 44-45, 414 P.3d at 
4/ HRE Rule 803(b)(6) (Supp. 2011) provides that the following are
not excluded by the rule against hearsay: 
A memorandum, report, record, or data compilation, in
any form, of acts, events, conditions, opinions, ordiagnoses, made in the course of a regularly conductedactivity, at or near the time of the acts, events,conditions, opinions, or diagnoses, as shown by thetestimony of the custodian or other qualified witness,or by certification that complies with rule 902(11) ora statute permitting certification, unless the sourcesof information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness. 
(Emphasis added.) 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
96-97. The court's decisions in Mattos and Behrendt are 
therefore dispositive as to whether HRE Rule 803(b)(6) may serve as a basis to admit the Attached Note into evidence. 
With respect to the Williams Affidavit, Williams did 
not aver that she was the custodian of records for BANA, Countrywide,
5/ or any other holder of the Note (e.g., U.S. 
Bank6/). Thus, the Attached Note is admissible under HRE Rule 
803(b)(6) only if the Williams Affidavit demonstrates that Williams is a "qualified witness" with respect to that document. See Mattos, 140 Hawai# i at 32, 398 P.3d at 621; Behrendt, 142 
Hawai# i at 45, 414 P.3d at 97. 
The supreme court has held that a witness may be 
qualified to provide the testimony required by HRE Rule 803(b)(6) even if the witness is not employed by the business that created the document or lacks direct, personal knowledge of how the document was created. See Mattos, 140 Hawai# i at 32, 398 P.3d at 
621; Behrendt, 142 Hawai# i at 45, 414 P.3d at 97. While there is 
"no requirement that the records have been prepared by the entity that has custody of them," the testifying witness "must have enough familiarity with the record-keeping system of the business that created the record to explain how the record was generated in the ordinary course of business." Behrendt, 142 Hawai# i at 
45, 414 P.3d at 97 (quoting and citing Mattos, 140 Hawai# i at 32, 
398 P.3d at 621). 
The court in Behrendt further explained:
 
Records received from another business and incorporated into
the receiving business' records may in some circumstances beregarded as 'created' by the receiving business.Incorporated records are admissible under HRE Rule 803(b)(6) 
5/ In its Complaint, U.S. Bank alleged that "[o]n or about August 10,
2005, [Thede], for value received, duly made, executed and delivered toCountrywide" the Note. (Emphasis added.) In addition, the Note identifiesCountrywide as the "Lender" and, in turn, defines the "Note Holder" as the"Lender or anyone who takes this Note by transfer and who is entitled toreceive payments under this Note." It therefore appears that Countrywide wasthe original holder of the Note. 
6/ The Complaint states: "By Assignment of Mortgage recorded December
8, 2009 . . . the mortgagee's interest in the Mortgage was assigned to [U.S.Bank]." Because the debt does not automatically follow the security (Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai #i at 371 n.17, 390 P.3d at 1258 n.17), it is not clear when
U.S. Bank became the holder of the Note. The Williams Affidavit states that BANA was in possession of the Note on April 9, 2012, but does not indicatewhen BANA's possession commenced. 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
when a custodian or qualified witness testifies that the
documents were incorporated and kept in the normal course ofbusiness, that the incorporating business typically reliesupon the accuracy of the contents of the documents, and thecircumstances otherwise indicate the trustworthiness of the document. 
Id. at 45, 414 P.3d at 97 (citation omitted) (citing Mattos, 140 
Hawai# i at 32, 398 P.3d at 621). 
Here, as in Mattos and Behrendt, the Williams Affidavit 
does not establish that the Attached Note was received by BANA and then incorporated into BANA's records. In addition, like the declaration in Behrendt, the Williams Affidavit does not establish that Williams was familiar with the record-keeping system of Countrywide or any other prior holder of the Note. See 
142 Hawai# i at 46, 414 P.3d at 98 (declaration of loan servicer 
employee "ma[de] no assertions as to [the declarant's] familiarity with the record-keeping systems of Funding Group or Option One, which first created the Note and allonges"). 
Thus, 
the Williams Declaration does not satisfy the foundational requirements to make Williams a qualified witness with respect to the Attached Note, and she could not authenticate it as a record of a regularly conducted activity under HRE Rule 803(b)(6). 
The Vieau and Wallace Declarations were similarly 
deficient in providing the foundation necessary to admit the Attached Note under HRE Rule 803(b)(6). Neither declarant stated that she was the custodian of records for Nationstar or any prior holder of the Note, so each had to demonstrate that she was a "qualified witness" with respect to the Attached Note. 
Yet 
neither declarant claimed to be familiar with the record-keeping system of Countrywide or any other holder of the Note before BANA. Indeed, the Wallace Declaration asserts, apparently erroneously, that Nationstar possessed the Attached Note prior to April 19, 2012, and does not assert that Wallace was even familiar with BANA's record-keeping system. The Vieau Declaration relies on the Williams Affidavit, which, for the reasons previously stated, is insufficient to admit the Attached Note under the business records exception. 
Absent the declaration of a "qualified witness" with 
respect to the Attached Note, U.S. Bank failed to establish its 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
 standing to foreclose. Because the Attached Note was not 
admissible as asserted, U.S. Bank did not meet its burden of establishing facts necessary for a grant of summary judgment. See Behrendt, 142 Hawai# i at 46, 414 P.3d at 98. Absent 
admission of the Note into evidence, U.S. Bank did not meet its burden on summary judgment. 
We therefore vacate the (1) Findings of Fact, 
Conclusions of Law and Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment Against All Defendants and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure, and (2) Judgment, both entered on April 3, 2018, by the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit. The case is remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this Summary Disposition Order.
