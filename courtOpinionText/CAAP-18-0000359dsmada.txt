ORDER GRANTING JUNE 4, 2018 MOTION TO DISMISS APPELLATE COURT
CASE NUMBER CAAP-18-0000359 FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Chan, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) Plaintiff-Appellee Food Planning
 
Service Hawaii, Inc.'s (Food Planning Service Hawaii), June 4,
 
2018 motion to dismiss appellate court case number 
CAAP-18-0000359 for lack of appellate jurisdiction, (2) the
 July 6, 2018 memorandum by Defendants-Appellants Su Send Chang
 Tran, dba Sweet Home Aunty, Vang Van Tran and Chih Chieh Chang
 (the Defendants) in opposition to Food Planning Service Hawaii's
 June 4, 2018 motion, and (3) the record, it appears that we lack
 appellate jurisdiction over the Defendants' appeal from the 
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
following three interlocutory orders by the Honorable Jeffrey P.
 
Crabtree because the circuit court has not yet entered a final
 judgment in Civil No. 16-1-0750-04 (JPC):
 
(1) a December 13, 2017 interlocutory order granting
Food Planning Service Hawaii's amended motion to
compel productions of documents;
 
(2) a December 14, 2017 interlocutory order granting
Food Planning Service Hawaii's amended motion to
compel answers to interrogatories; and
 
(3) an April 2, 2018 interlocutory order awardingattorney's fees and costs to Food Planning ServiceHawaii based on discovery issues pursuant toRule 37(a)(4) of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP). 
We initially note that the Defendants' April 25, 2018 
notice of appeal is timely under Hawai' i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 4(a)(1) only as to the April 2, 2018 
interlocutory order. "When a civil appeal is permitted by law, the notice of appeal shall be filed within 30 days after entry of the judgment or appealable order." The Defendants did not file their April 25, 2018 notice of appeal within thirty days after entry of the December 13, 2017 interlocutory order or the December 14, 2017 interlocutory order. The failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise of judicial discretion. Bacon 
v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP
 Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or justice is authorized to
 change the jurisdictional requirements contained in Rule 4 of
 these rules."); HRAP Rule 26(e) ("The reviewing court for good
 cause shown may relieve a party from a default occasioned by any
 failure to comply with these rules, except the failure to give
 timely notice of appeal."). Therefore, even if the December 13,
 2017 interlocutory order and December 14, 2017 interlocutory
 order were appealable interlocutory orders, the Defendants' 
April 25, 2018 notice of appeal would be untimely as to them
 under HRAP Rule 4(a)(1).

With respect to the April 2, 2018 interlocutory order, 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (2016) authorizes 
appeals to the Hawai' i Intermediate Court of Appeals from final 
judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). HRCP Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." Based on this requirement under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i has 
held that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 
76 Hawai' i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). "Thus, based on 
Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 
119 Hawai' i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008); Bailey v. 
Duvauchelle, 135 Hawai' i 482, 489, 353 P.3d 1024, 1031 (2015). 
Consequently, "[a]n appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Jenkins, 
76 Hawai' i at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote omitted). On 
June 13, 2018, the circuit court clerk filed the record on appeal for appellate court case number CAAP-18-0000359, which does not include a final judgment. 
Although exceptions to the final judgment requirement 
exist under the doctrine in Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848) (the Forgay doctrine), the collateral order doctrine, and HRS § 641-1(b) (2016), the April 2, 2018 interlocutory order does not satisfy the requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine, the collateral order doctrine, or HRS § 641-1(b). See 
Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai' i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) 
(regarding the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai' i 319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding the 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
three requirements for the collateral order doctrine); HRS 
§ 641-1(b) (regarding the requirements for an appeal from an
 interlocutory order).
 
We note that, when analyzing specifically whether a 
discovery order was appealable under the collateral order doctrine, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i has consistently "h[e]ld 
that there is no appellate jurisdiction over interlocutory appeals from discovery orders, [even] despite a claim of attorney-client privilege." Abrams, 88 Hawai' i at 323, 966 P.2d 
at 635 (footnote omitted); Brende v. Hara, 113 Hawai' i 424, 429, 
153 P.3d 1109, 1114 (2007) ("Discovery orders are not immediately appealable[.]"). "In the exceptional case, parties are not without a remedy. A petition for writ of mandamus is available for extraordinary situations." Abrams, 88 Hawai' i at 323, 966 
P.2d at 635 (footnote omitted). 
Even to the extent that one views the April 2, 2018 
interlocutory order as a "sanction order" rather than a "discovery order," the Supreme Court of Hawai' i has held that an 
interlocutory sanction order against a party is appealable under the "collateral order doctrine" only if "the order directed payment of the assessed sum and was immediately enforceable through contempt proceedings." Harada v. Ellis, 60 Haw. 467, 
480, 591 P.2d 1060, 1070 (1979) (emphases added). A sanction order against a party is immediately enforceable through contempt proceedings only if the sanction order requires the party to pay the sanction in a specific amount by a specific day, so that upon the expiration of that specific day, one can conclusively determine whether the sanctioned party has complied with the sanction order, and if the party has not complied, then the court can immediately find that party in contempt of court. 
In fact, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i has held that an 
interlocutory order awarding attorneys' fees and costs without a due date is not independently appealable even if the circuit court purports to certify that interlocutory order as a judgment pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b), because an order awarding attorney's 
-4­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
fees and costs "is not a final decision with respect to a claim 
for relief." Fujimoto v. Au, 95 Hawai' i 116, 136 n.16, 19 P.3d 
699, 719 n.16 (2001) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Consequently, "[a]bsent entry of an appealable final judgment on the claims . . . [to which an award of attorneys' fees and costs relates], the award of attorneys' fees and costs is . . . not appealable." Fujimoto v. Au, 95 Hawai' i at 123, 19 
P.3d at 706; CRSC, Inc. v. Sage Diamond Co., Inc., 95 Hawai' i 
301, 306, 22 P.3d 97, 102 (App. 2001) ("Similarly, the September 23, 1999 Order [awarding only attorneys' fees] and the February 3, 2000 Judgment [awarding only attorneys' fees] are not appealable, and we do not have appellate jurisdiction to review them."). 
Although the April 2, 2018 interlocutory order awards
 
attorney's fees and costs in specific amounts in favor of Food
 Planning Service Hawaii, the April 2, 2018 interlocutory order
 does not provide a specific date by which the Defendants must pay
 the awards to Food Planning Service Hawaii, and, thus, the
 April 2, 2018 interlocutory order is not immediately enforceable
 through contempt proceedings, as a sanction order against a party
 must be in order to qualify for immediate appealability under the
 collateral order doctrine and the holding in Harada. Absent an
 appealable final judgment, the Defendants appeal from the
 April 2, 2018 interlocutory order is premature, and we lack
 appellate jurisdiction over appellate court case number 
CAAP-18-0000359.
 
Granted, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i recently held 
that, when the record on appeal indicates that the circuit court has resolved all claims against all parties, and the only thing lacking to perfect an aggrieved party's right to obtain appellate review is the entry of an appealable final judgment, the Hawai' i 
Intermediate Court of Appeals should invoke HRS § 602-57(3) (2016), and temporarily remand the case to the circuit court with instructions to enter, and supplement the record on appeal with, an appealable final judgment as to all claims and parties.

Waikiki v. Ho' omaka Village Association of Apartment Owners, 
140 Hawai' i 197, 204, 398 P.3d 786, 793 (2017). However, the 
holding in Waikiki is distinguishable from the instant case, 
because the circuit court in the instant case has not yet adjudicated Food Planning Service's eight-count April 19, 2018 first amended complaint against the Defendants, which is still pending before the circuit court. Where, as here, the record on appeal does not indicate that the circuit court has resolved all claims as to all parties, a temporary remand with instructions to enter an appealable final judgment on all claims is neither warranted nor authorized under HRS § 602-57(3) and the holding in Waikiki. In the absence of an appealable final judgment as to all claims and parties, the Defendants' appeal is premature and we lack appellate jurisdiction. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Food Planning 
Service Hawaii's June 4, 2018 motion to dismiss this appeal is granted, and appellate court case number CAAP-18-0000359 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, September 25, 2018.
