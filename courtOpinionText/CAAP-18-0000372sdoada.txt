v.

A
PPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
HONOLULU DIVISION 
(CIVIL NO. 1SS18-1-318) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Chan, JJ.) 
Respondent-Appellant Abraham Martin (Martin), pro se, 
appeals from the denial by the District Court of the First 
Circuit (district 
court)1 of Martin's April 24, 2018 motion for 
reconsideration of the March 27, 2018 Injunction Against Harassment granted in favor of Petitioner-Appellee Gali Huff (Huff), pro se, and against Martin.

1 The Honorable Hilary B. Gangnes presided. 
2 Martin's notice of appeal and opening brief purports to appeal the
March 27, 2018 Injunction Against Harassment. However, no party filed a
notice of appeal within thirty days after the district court's entry of theInjunction Against Harassment, as required under Hawai #i Rules of Appellate
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 4(a)(1) for a timely appeal. Furthermore, Martin'sApril 24, 2018 motion for reconsideration, filed pursuant to District CourtRules of Civil Procedure (DCRCP) Rule 60(b), is not a timely tolling motionthat would have invoked the tolling provision in HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) and wouldhave permitted this court to review the district court's granting of theInjunction Against Harassment. Cf. Lambert v. Lua, 92 Hawai #i 228, 234, 990
P.2d 126, 132 (App. 1999) ("An [Hawai #i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP)] Rule
60(b) motion for relief from judgment may toll the period for appealing ajudgment or order, but only if the motion is served and filed with ten (10)days after the judgment is entered." (Citation omitted)); Simbajon v. Gentry,81 Hawai #i 193, 196, 914 P.2d 1386, 1389 (App. 1996). Therefore, this court NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
We note as a threshold matter that Martin's opening 
brief fails to comply with the provisions of HRAP Rule 28(b), 
which alone is sufficient to affirm the judgment of the district court. See Kawamata Farms, Inc. v. United Agri Prods., 86 Hawai# i 214, 235, 948 P.2d 1055, 1076 (1997). Nonetheless, due 
to this jurisdiction's policy of "affording litigants the opportunity 'to have their cases heard on the merits, where possible,'" we proceed to the merits. Marvin v. Pflueger, 127 Hawai# i 490, 496, 280 P.3d 88, 94 (2012) (quoting Morgan v. 
Planning Dep't, Cty. of Kauai, 104 Hawai
#i 173, 180–81, 86 P.3d 
982, 989–90 (2004)). 
We review a "trial court's ruling on a motion for 
reconsideration . . . under the abuse of discretion standard." Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Wailea Elua v. Wailea Resort Co., Ltd., 100 Hawai# i 97, 110, 58 P.3d 608, 621 (2002). An abuse of 
discretion occurs if the trial court has "clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant." Amfac, Inc. v. Waikiki Beachcomber Inv. Co., 74 Haw. 85, 114, 839 P.2d 10, 26 (1992). 
[T]he purpose of a motion for reconsideration is to allow
the parties to present new evidence and/or arguments thatcould not have been presented during the earlier adjudicatedmotion. Reconsideration is not a device to relitigate oldmatters or to raise arguments or evidence that could andshould have been brought during the earlier proceeding. 
Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Wailea Elua, 100 Hawai# i at 110, 58 
P.3d at 621 (quoting Sousaris v. Miller, 92 Hawai# i 505, 513, 993 
P.2d 539, 547 (2000)). 
In denying Martin's motion for reconsideration, the 
district court noted that there were "no new facts or law to 
support reconsideration or new trial." Upon review of Martin's motion for reconsideration, we conclude that Martin indeed did not present any new evidence or arguments that could not have been presented earlier in his initial opposition to the Injunction Against Harassment. We therefore conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Martin's 
has appellate jurisdiction only as to the April 24, 2018 denial of Martin's
motion for reconsideration.

motion for reconsideration. 
On appeal, Martin also alleges that the district court 
judge was biased against Martin. 
The only support Martin 
provides for this allegation in his opening brief is a reference 
to the "Notice for Judge Hilary Gangnes to Recuse Herself From Abraham Martin's All Future Cases in the District Court," filed May 14, 2018, after the instant appeal of the district court's denial of Martin's motion for reconsideration had already been filed. In Martin's request for the trial judge to recuse herself, Martin points to no specific source of the trial judge's alleged bias other than circumstantial evidence of the court's adverse rulings. However, Hawai# i courts have long adhered to 
the general rule that "standing alone, mere erroneous or adverse rulings by the trial judge do not spell bias or prejudice."

v. Hundahl, 78 Hawai# i 230, 242, 891 P.2d 1022, 1034 (1995) 
(internal quotation marks, citation, and brackets omitted).  We therefore reject this contention on appeal. 
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the District Court of 
the First Circuit's denial of the April 24, 2018 Motion for Reconsideration.
