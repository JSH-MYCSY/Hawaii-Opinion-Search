APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD 
(CASE NO. AB 2016-301; DCD NO. 2-15-08619) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Janis Fernandez dba Exodus Bail Bond (Ms. Fernandez), 
self-represented, appeals from a March 29, 2018 Decision and 
Order (D&O) by the Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(LIRAB).1 In relevant part, the LIRAB held that Vida Garcia 
(Garcia) sustained a work injury to her right knee on October 1, 
2014, while in the employ of Ms. Fernandez, and that Ms. 
Fernandez had failed to secure workers' compensation insurance in 
accordance with Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 386-123. The 
LIRAB penalized Ms. Fernandez $1,290.00 for failing to secure 
workers' compensation insurance, payable to the Special 
Compensation Fund (SCF).
 SCF appeals from the D&O and the LIRAB's Order Denying 
Motion for Reconsideration filed May 18, 2018.2 On July 11, 
2018, this court granted SCF's motion to consolidate CAAP-18-0000375 and CAAP-18-0000492 under CAAP-18-0000375.
 On appeal, Ms. Fernandez argues
3 that her husband, Frank 
Fernandez (Mr. Fernandez), was the owner of Exodus Bail Bond, and 
that the LIRAB erred in determining that she was the owner of 
Exodus Bail Bond and Garcia's employer by: (1) failing to take 
judicial notice of documents related to proceedings revoking Mr. 
Fernandez's insurance producer license and law license, which Ms. 
1   This appeal was designated CAAP-18-0000375. 
2 This appeal was designated CAAP-18-0000492. 
3   Ms. Fernandez's Opening Brief does not comply with Hawai #i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b) because it fails to: include appropriate
record references; identify where in the record the alleged error occurred and
was objected to or brought to the attention of the agency; and cite theauthorities, statutes, and parts of the record relied on. Violations of HRAP Rule 28(b) raise the potential for dismissal of the appeal and/or waiver ofissues sought to be raised. Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai #i 225, 230,
909 P.2d 553, 558 (1995); HRAP Rule 30 ("When the brief of an appellant isotherwise not in conformity with these rules, the appeal may bedismissed[.]"); HRAP Rule 28(b)(3), (4), (7). Nonetheless, we address Ms.Fernandez's points of error to the extent they can be discerned because theHawai #i appellate courts have "consistently adhered to the policy of affording
litigants the opportunity 'to have their cases heard on the merits, wherepossible.'" Morgan v. Planning Dep't, 104 Hawai #i 173, 180-81, 86 P.3d 982,
989-90 (2004) (quoting O'Connor v. Diocese of Honolulu, 77 Hawai #i 383, 386,
885 P.2d 361, 364 (1994)); see Wagner v. World Botanical Gardens, Inc., 126Hawai #i 190, 193, 268 P.3d 443, 446 (App. 2011) (stating that in light of an
appellant's status as a self-represented litigant, this court would addresshis arguments on appeal to the extent they could be reasonably discerned). 
2   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Fernandez asserts mention Mr. Fernandez and not her in relation 
to Exodus Bail Bond; (2) failing to further question Mr. 
Fernandez at the hearing about those documents and whether he was 
the owner of Exodus Bail Bond; and (3) citing evidence not 
produced at the hearing in paragraphs "g"-"n" of the Summary of 
the Evidence subsection in the D&O.4 
SCF contends on appeal that the LIRAB erred in 
determining that Ms. Fernandez was in violation of HRS § 386-123 
for the period of October 1, 2014, to February 6, 2015, and 
penalizing her in the amount of $1,290.00. SCF argues that 
Garcia was employed from January 24, 2014, to February 6, 2015, 
and should have been penalized pursuant to HRS § 386-123 
according to that period. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Ms. 
Fernandez's and SCF's points of error as follows. 
It is axiomatic that we are "under an obligation to ensure
that we have jurisdiction to hear and determine each caseand to dismiss an appeal on our own motion where we concludewe lack jurisdiction." BDM, Inc. v. Sageco, Inc., 57 Haw.
73, 73, 549 P.2d 1147, 1148 (1976). "When we perceive a
jurisdictional defect in an appeal, we must,  sua sponte ,
dismiss that appeal." Familian N[.W.], Inc. v. Cent. Pac.
Boiler & Piping, Ltd., 68 Haw. 368, 369, 714 P.2d 936, 937
(1986). 
4 Ms. Fernandez also argued in her Reply Brief that this court should
take into consideration or take judicial notice of the Complaint filed inFrank M. Fernandez, Frank M. Fernandez dba Exodus Bail Bond and Exodus BailBond L.L.C. v. Eric A. Seitz and Ronald N.W.B. Kim, Civil No. 19-1-0216-02, onFebruary 7, 2019, in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Complaint). The Complaint does not appear in the record, HRS § 641-2 ("Every appeal shall betaken on the record, and no new evidence shall be introduced in the[appellate] court."), and is a matter outside of the scope of the answeringbrief, in violation of HRAP Rule 28(d). Further, the Complaint is composed ofmere allegations and does not amount to facts "either (1) generally knownwithin the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court, or (2) capable ofaccurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannotreasonably be questioned." See Hawaii Rules of Evidence Rule 201. Based on 
the foregoing, we decline to consider or judicially notice the assertionscontained in the Complaint. 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Brooks v. Dana Nance & Co., 113 Hawai# i 406, 412, 153 P.3d 1091, 
1097 (2007) (original brackets omitted) (quoting Bacon v. Karlin, 
68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1129 (1986)).
 As a threshold matter, we address whether Ms. Fernandez 
may pursue this appeal as self-represented, and thus whether we 
have appellate jurisdiction. We note that exhibits in the record 
indicate that both "Exodus Bail Bond, LLC" (the LLC) and the 
trade name "Exodus Bail Bond" were apparently in active existence 
at the time Garcia worked for "Exodus Bail Bond" and at the time 
of the injury at issue. We have previously held in a separate 
and unrelated case that Ms. Fernandez, a non-attorney, was not 
permitted to file an opening brief on behalf of Exodus Bail Bond, 
LLC. State v. Mezurashi, No. CAAP–11–0000638, 2013 WL 2149684, 
at *1 n.1 (Haw. App. May 16, 2013) (SDO) (citing Oahu Plumbing & Sheet Metal, Ltd., 60 Haw. 372, 377, 590 P.2d 570, 573–74 (1979); 
and HRS §§ 605–2, 605–14). Here, however, the party in interest 
has consistently been named as the sole proprietorship of "Janis 
Fernandez, dba Exodus Bail Bond," including in Conclusion of Law 
(COL) 1 in the D&O. Furthermore, at the LIRAB hearing, Ms. 
Fernandez's attorney and Mr. Fernandez stated that the LLC and 
the sole proprietorship doing business under the trade name 
Exodus Bail Bond were separate entities and Ms. Fernandez's 
attorney stated several times that the issue of concern is 
whether Ms. Fernandez was an employer in regards to the sole 
proprietorship and not the LLC. Ms. Fernandez may self-represent 
the sole proprietorship on appeal. See Cervelli v. Aloha Bed & 
Breakfast, 142 Hawai# i 177, 193 n.16, 415 P.3d 919, 935 n.16 
(App. 2018) ("In the case of a sole proprietorship, the firm name 
and the sole proprietor's name are but two names for one person." 
(brackets and citation omitted)); Credit Associates of Maui, Ltd. 
v. Carlbom, 98 Hawai# i 462, 465, 50 P.3d 431, 434 (App. 2002) 
("[A] sole proprietorship has no legal identity apart from its owner."); see also United States v. Hagerman, 545 F.3d 579, 581 
(7th Cir. 2008) ("A sole proprietorship may litigate pro se 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
because it has no legal identity separate from the proprietor[.]" 
(citations omitted)); Dutch Vill. Mall v. Pelletti, 256 P.3d 
1251, 1254 (Wash. Ct. App. 2011) ("'Unlike a sole proprietorship, 
a sole member limited liability company is a distinct legal 
entity that is separate from its owner;' such a company may 
appear in federal court only through a licensed attorney." 
(quoting and citing Lattanzio v. COMTA, 481 F.3d 137, 140 (2d 
Cir. 2007)). We thus have jurisdiction to review Ms. Fernandez's 
appeal. 
The LIRAB's Finding of Fact (FOF) 2 determined that 
"Exodus Bail Bond, and Exodus Bail Bonds, LLC . . . all refer to 
the entity owned by Ms. Fernandez." HRS § 428-303 (2004) 
provides in relevant part that 
the debts, obligations, and liabilities of a limited
liability company, whether arising in contract, tort, orotherwise, are solely the debts, obligations, andliabilities of the company. A member or manager shall notbe personally liable for any debt, obligation, or liabilityof the company solely by reason of being or acting as amember or a manager. 
On the other hand, "a sole proprietorship has no legal identity 
apart from its owner." Credit Associates of Maui, Ltd., 98 
Hawai# i at 465, 50 P.3d at 434. Here, the evidence relied on by 
the LIRAB show that the trade name was registered to Ms. 
Fernandez and not the LLC, and they were therefore separate 
entities. 
Thus, the LIRAB decision could not properly be made 
against Ms. Fernandez in her personal capacity for the actions or omissions of the LLC under the circumstances here. Despite FOF 
2, we review the merits of the appeal insofar as COL 1 held that 
the decision was against "Janis Fernandez dba Exodus Bail Bond" 
and not the LLC. 
As to the merits of Ms. Fernandez's appeal, we first 
conclude that the LIRAB did not err in not taking judicial notice 
of three documents (collectively, the Documents): (1) a 
Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs (DCCA) Insurance 
Commissioner's Final Order, dated March 16, 2016; (2) a DCCA 
Insurance Division Notice of Intent to Impose Fines, Revoke 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
License, and Issue Cease and Desist, dated July 28, 2014; and (3) 
a Supreme Court of the State of Hawai# i Order of Disbarment in 
Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Frank M. Fernandez, NO. SCAD-12-0000376 (Feb. 14, 2013). HRS § 91–10 (2012) sets forth 
evidentiary standards for contested cases, such as Ms. 
Fernandez's appeal to the LIRAB. 
HRS § 91–10(4) provides: 
Agencies may take notice of judicially recognizable facts.
In addition, they may take notice of generally recognizedtechnical or scientific facts within their specializedknowledge; but parties shall be notified either before orduring the hearing, or by reference in preliminary reportsor otherwise, of the material so noticed, and they shall beafforded an opportunity to contest the facts so noticed[.] 
Similarly, Hawaii Administrative Rules (HAR) § 12–47–47 (eff. 
1994) provides, in pertinent part: 
The [LIRAB] may take official notice of those matters as may
be judicially noticed by the courts of the State. . . . Anyparty shall have an opportunity to contest the facts sonoticed, within the time specified by the presiding member. 
See also HAR § 12-47-41 (eff. 1994) ("The board shall not be 
bound by statutory and common law rules relating to the admission 
or rejection of evidence. The board may exercise its own 
discretion in these matters, limited only by considerations of 
relevancy, materiality, and repetition, by the rules of privilege 
recognized by law, and with a view to securing a just, speedy, 
and inexpensive determination of the proceedings."). Despite 
references during the LIRAB hearing to the proceedings revoking 
the insurance producer licenses of Mr. and Ms. Fernandez and 
Exodus Bail Bond, LLC, neither Ms. Fernandez nor the other 
parties requested that the LIRAB take judicial notice of the 
Documents and there is no indication that it was brought to the 
LIRAB's attention that the Documents addressed the ownership of 
the sole proprietorship doing business under the trade name 
Exodus Bail Bond. Under such circumstances, we find no error in 
the failure of the LIRAB to judicially notice the Documents sua 
sponte. See Paul's Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Befitel, 104 Hawai# i 
412, 417, 91 P.3d 494, 499 (2004) ("HRS § 91–14(g)(6) provides 
that an agency's exercise of discretion will not be disturbed 
6   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
unless '[a]rbitrary, or capricious, or characterized by abuse of 
discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.'"). 
The LIRAB did not err in failing to further question 
Mr. Fernandez about the Documents and as to whether he owned the 
sole proprietorship doing business as Exodus Bail Bond. The 
LIRAB rules permit "[a]ny [LIRAB] member [to] question any party 
or witness[.]" HAR 12-47-42(c) (eff. 1994). Nonetheless, Ms. 
Fernandez had the right to question Mr. Fernandez further as to 
those issues, HRS § 91-9(c) (2012) and HAR 12-47-42(b) (eff. 
1994), and as the appellant in the LIRAB hearing, maintained the 
burden to prove that the Department of Labor and Industrial 
Relations, Disability Compensation Division erred in determining 
that she was the owner of Exodus Bail Bond and the employer of 
Garcia. See HRS § 91-10(5) ("Except as otherwise provided by 
law, the party initiating the proceeding shall have the burden of proof, including the burden of producing evidence as well as the 
burden of persuasion. The degree or quantum of proof shall be a 
preponderance of the evidence."). The LIRAB rules do not alter 
this burden, and thus the LIRAB did not err in failing to further 
question Mr. Fernandez about the Documents or on the issue of 
ownership of Exodus Bail Bond. See Paul's Elec. Serv., Inc., 104 
Hawai# i at 417, 91 P.3d at 499. 
Ms. Fernandez's contention that the LIRAB considered 
evidence not produced at the hearing in paragraphs "g"-"n" of the Summary of the Evidence subsection in the D&O, is without merit. 
The evidence cited in paragraphs "g"-"n"
5 were admitted into 
5 Paragraphs "g" through "n" provide: 
g. By letter dated June 15, 2015, Anthony Fujii,
Esq., on behalf of Exodus Bail Bonds, responded to the
Department's request for a WC-1. Mr. Fujii stated thatClaimant was never an "employee" of Exodus Bail Bonds, but,rather, was an independent contractor. The letter did not include any statement or other indication that Ms. Fernandezwas not the principle of Exodus Bail Bonds. 
h. Quentin Lee of the Disability Compensation
Division prepared a November 24, 2015 letter addressed to 
7         
        
               NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
evidence as SCF's Exhibits 1, 2, 3, 4, or otherwise included in 
the agency file available to the parties. We note, however, that 
the LIRAB appears to have miscited the June 22, 2015 letter from 
Anthony Fujii, Esq., in evidence as SCF's Exhibit 1, in paragraph 
"g", as being a letter dated "June 15, 2015." Nonetheless, the 
description of Anthony Fujii's letter contained in paragraph "g" 
is sufficient to discern that the LIRAB intended to reference the 
June 22, 2015 letter and there appears to be no other letter from 
Anthony Fujii in the record. Therefore, Ms. Fernandez's 
substantial rights were not prejudiced and the error was 
harmless. See HRS § 91-14(g) (providing that the court "may 
reverse or modify the decision and order [of the agency] if the 
substantial rights of the petitioners may have been prejudiced"). 
Janis H Fernandez 
dba: Exodus Bail Bond c/o Anthony Fujii, Esq.[address] 
i. Mr. Lee's November 24, 2015 letter requested a
WC-1. 
j. In a memo dated January 4, 2016, the Disability
Compensation Division identified Janis Fernandez asClaimant's employer. 
k. A letter on file with the Department of Commerce
and Consumer Affairs ("DCCA") dated May 10, 2011, states,"We have no objections and I give my consent to theregistration of the [name Exodus Bail Bond]. I am authorized to give this consent on behalf of Exodus BailBond, LLC." The letter purports to be signed by Ms.Fernandez as Manager of "Exodus Bail Bond, LLC." At trial,Ms. Fernandez testified that she did not sign such letter. 
l. A DCCA form, Application for Registration of Trade
Name, identifies Ms. Fernandez as a sole proprietor and theregistrant of the trade name "Exodus Bail Bond." 
m. In a DCCA website printout, Ms. Fernandez is
identified as the registrant of the trade name "Exodus BailBond" from May 12, 2011 to May 11, 2016. 
n. A May 19, 2016 letter from the State of Hawaii,
Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, InsuranceDivision confirmed Frank M. Fernandez, Janis Hu Fernandez,and Exodus Bail Bond, LLC had active "resident producerlicenses" on October 1, 2014.

    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
We now turn to SCF's appeal, in which SCF contends that 
the LIRAB erred in calculating the penalty assessed to Ms. 
Fernandez under HRS §§ 386-121 and 386-123, by calculating the 
penalty from the date of Garcia's work injury on October 1, 2014, 
instead of the date she began working for Ms. Fernandez.6 
The interpretation of a statute is a question of law
reviewable de novo . This court's construction of statutes 
is guided by the following rules: 
When construing a statute, our foremost
obligation is to ascertain and give effect tothe intention of the legislature which is to beobtained primarily from the language containedin the statute itself. We must read statutorylanguage in the context of the entire statuteand construe it in a manner consistent with its purpose. When there is doubt, doubleness ofmeaning, or indistinctiveness or uncertainty ofan expression used in a statute an ambiguityexists. If the statutory language is ambiguousor doubt exists as to its meaning, courts maytake legislative history into consideration inconstruing a statute.

Hawai# i 141, 163, 324 P.3d 951, 973 (2014) (quotation marks and 
citations omitted). Pursuant to HRS § 386-121 (Supp. 2014),  7
6 SCF does not contest that Garcia's employment was terminated on
February 6, 2015. 
7 HRS § 386-121(a) provides:
 §386-121 Security for payment of compensation;
misdemeanor. (a) Employers, except the State, any county
or political subdivision of the State, or other public
entity within the State, shall secure compensation to theiremployees in one of the following ways:

(2) By depositing and maintaining with the statedirector of finance security satisfactory to thedirector of labor and industrial relations securing the payment by the employer ofcompensation according to the terms of thischapter;

order to obtain the benefits of paragraph (3) shall beguilty of a misdemeanor.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
State" or using the other enumerated methods. HRS § 386-123 
(1993) provides, in relevant part: 
If an employer fails to comply with section 386-121, the
employer shall be liable for a penalty of not less than $250or of $10 for each employee for every day during which suchfailure continues, whichever sum is greater, to be recoveredin an action brought by the director in the name of theState, and the amount so collected shall be paid into thespecial compensation fund created by section 386-151. The director may, however, in the director's discretion, forgood cause shown, remit all or any part of the penalty inexcess of $250, provided the employer in default complieswith section 386-121. With respect to such actions, theattorney general or any county attorney or public prosecutorshall prosecute the same if so requested by the director. 
(Emphasis added.) The plain language of HRS § 386-121 requires 
an employer to "secure compensation to their employees," by 
obtaining one of the enumerated forms of workers' compensation 
coverage. Thus, coverage should be obtained at the point when 
the employee begins providing services for the employer and an 
employer-employee relationship is created.8 The purpose of this 
requirement is to shield employees from the consequences of work injuries during the entire period of employment. See Travelers 
Ins. Co. v. Hawaii Roofing, Inc., 64 Haw. 380, 385, 641 P.2d 1333, 1337 (1982) ("HRS §§ 386-121 through 128 constitute an 
essential component of an independent statutory system of legal 
relations designed to shield workers from the consequences of 
work injuries. For this part of the law ensures the payment of 
compensation to injured workers. The Director has a duty 
thereunder of compelling employers who choose insurance as the 
means of securing compensation payments to their employees to 
maintain insurance coverage at all times." (citation omitted)). 
As a result, under HRS § 386-123, the penalty assessed for 
violation of HRS § 386-121 is calculated from the time the 
8 HRS § 386-1 (1993 and Supp. 2014) defines an "employer," in
pertinent part, as "any person having one or more persons in the person's
employment" and defines "employment," in pertinent part, as "any serviceperformed by an individual for another person under any contract of hire orapprenticeship, express or implied, oral or written, whether lawfully orunlawfully entered into." Further, an "employee" is defined in HRS 386-1 as"any individual in the employment of another person." 
11 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
employer-employee relationship begins, and continues for each 
employee for every day during which such failure to maintain 
workers' compensation coverage continues.
 In this case, in COL 4,9 the LIRAB calculated the penalty 
from the date of Garcia's work injury. COL 4 was therefore 
wrong. Ihara v. State Dep't of Land & Nat. Res.
, 141 Hawai# i 36, 
41, 404 P.3d 302, 307 (2017) ("[T]the LIRAB's conclusions will be 
reviewed de novo, under the right/wrong standard."). The LIRAB 
never made a finding as to when Garcia's employment began. 
Rather, it only determined that Garcia was an employee of Ms. 
Fernandez at the time of her work injury. This case must be 
remanded for the LIRAB to make a finding as to when Garcia's 
employment began and to further determine the period during which 
Ms. Fernandez was in violation of HRS §§ 386-121 and 
386-123.10
 Based on the foregoing, we vacate COL 4 of the March 29, 
2018 Decision and Order and remand the case for further 
proceedings consistent with this summary disposition order. The 
Decision and Order is affirmed in all other respects.
