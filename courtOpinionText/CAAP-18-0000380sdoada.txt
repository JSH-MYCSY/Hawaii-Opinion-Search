APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 14-1-121K) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and McCullen, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Association of Apartment Owners of 
Elima Lani Condominiums (the 
AOAO) appeals from the April 4, 2018 
Judgment (Judgment) entered by the Circuit Court of the Third 
Circuit (Circuit Court).  The AOAO also challenges, in part, the 1

Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law; Order Granting 
Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure entered by the Circuit Court on April 4, 
2018 (Foreclosure Decree). 
The AOAO raises two points of error on appeal, 
contending that the Circuit Court erred when it: (1) ordered 
that the AOAO's right to possess and collect rent from the 
subject property (Property) was extinguished upon the entry of 
the Foreclosure Decree and Judgment, and order the foreclosure 
commissioner (Commissioner) to take possession and control of the 
Property owned by the AOAO, including the collection and 
retention of rents; and (2) when it vested the Commissioner with legal and equitable title to the Property in the Foreclosure Decree. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve the AOAO's points of error as follows: 
We conclude that the Circuit Court did not err or abuse 
its discretion in ordering the Commissioner to take possession of and to manage, preserve, and sell the Property, including the collection of rents, because under 
Hawai#i law, a judgment 
entered on a foreclosure decree is a final determination of a foreclosed party's ownership interests in the subject property, notwithstanding that further proceedings are necessary to enforce

and otherwise effectuate the foreclosure decree and judgment. 
See Bank of New York Mellon v. Larrua, No. CAAP-17-0000904, 2022 WL 277671, at *1 (Haw. App. Jan. 31, 2022). 
Regarding the vesting of title to the Property in the 
Commissioner, the Foreclosure Decree does not state that the 
title is vested in the Commissioner; rather, it states that the 
Commissioner shall hold legal and equitable title to the 
Property. Thus, we cannot conclude that the Circuit Court erred 
by stating that the Commissioner was "vested" with legal and equitable title to the Property. It appears that the Commissioner was simply ordered to temporarily "hold" the title, in conjunction with the Commissioner's role as the agent of the Circuit Court, in order to carry out the court's further orders set forth in the Foreclosure Decree. However, we further conclude, even if the Foreclosure Decree could be construed as (erroneously) vesting title to the Property in the Commissioner, any such error was harmless.

v. Chinen, Nos. CAAP-18-0000486 and CAAP-18-0000963 (consolidated), 2022 WL 574511, *9 (Haw. App. Feb. 28, 2022).
