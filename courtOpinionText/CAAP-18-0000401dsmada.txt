CAAP-18-0000401
STATE OF HAWAI #I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
ALFRED N. SPINNEY, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
NORTH AND SOUTH KONA DIVISION
(CASE NO. 3DCW-17-0000900)
ORDER DISMISSING APPELLATE COURT CASE NUMBER
CAAP-18-0000401 FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
Upon review of the record of district court criminal
case number 3DCW-17-0000900 for appellate court case number CAAP-
CAAP-18-0000401, it appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction
pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-12(a) (2016).  In
this appeal, Defendant-Appellant Alfred Napahueluna Spinney
(Spinney),  pro se, appeals from the Honorable Harry Freitas's
February 14, 2018 interlocutory order and the Honorable M. Kanani
Laubach's May 10, 2018 interlocutory order from the ongoing
proceedings for Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawaii's (the State)
April 4, 2017 complaint against Spinney for criminal contempt of
court in violation of HRS § 710-1077 (2014 & Supp. 2017).  Under
these circumstances, dismissal of the appeal is warranted.
"The right of appeal in a criminal case is purely
statutory[.]"  State v. Nicol , 140 Hawai #i 482, 485, 403 P.3d
259, 262 (2017) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
The Hawai #i Intermediate Court of Appeals has jurisdiction "[t]o
hear and determine appeals from any court or agency when appeals
are allowed by law[.]"  HRS § 602-57(1) (2016).  HRS § 641-12(a)
is the statute providing that "[a]ppeals upon the record shall beNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
allowed from all final decisions and final judgments of district
courts in all criminal matters."  Consequently, "in order to
appeal a criminal matter in the district court, the appealing
party must appeal from a written judgment or order that has been
filed with the clerk of the court pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(b)(3)." 
State v. Bohannon, 102 Hawai# i 228, 236, 74 P.3d 980, 988 (2003);
see also Rule 32(c)(2) of the Hawai #i Rules of Penal Procedure;
State v. Kilborn , 109 Hawai #i 435, 442, 127 P.3d 95, 102 (App.
2005). 
In the instant appeal, none of the appealed orders are
independently appealable under HRS § 641-12, and, thus, they are
interlocutory orders that would be eligible for appellate review
only by way of an appeal from an appealable final judgment under
the principle that, "[a]s a general rule, an appeal from a final
judgment in a case brings up for review all preceding
interlocutory orders in the case."  State v. Adam , 97 Hawai #i
475, 482, 40 P.3d 877, 884 (2002) (citations omitted). The
district court has not yet entered a final judgment on the
State's original April 4, 2017 complaint for criminal contempt of
court in violation of HRS § 710-1077, and, thus, we lack
appellate jurisdiction.1
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
case number CAAP-18-0000401 is dismissed for lack of appellate
jurisdiction.

court of jurisdiction over the appealed case."  TSA International Limited v.
Shimizu Corporation, 92 Hawai #i 243, 265, 990 P.2d 713, 735 (1999) (citations

valid under the applicable statutory provisions and procedural rules.  Where
the notice of appeal is jurisdictionally defective, filing the notice does not
transfer jurisdiction from the trial court to the appellate court."  State v.
