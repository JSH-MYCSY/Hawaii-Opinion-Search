  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY WADSWORTH, J. 
This appeal stems from a dispute involving the sale of 
real property in Hanalei, 
Hawai#i (the Property). In their 
Complaint, Plaintiffs-Appellants Richard K. Adkins (Adkins)
 and 
Brown Eyed Girl, LLC (BEG) (collectively, Plaintiffs) alleged 
that Defendants/Third-Party Plaintiffs-Appellees Gary R. Fischer 
and Samantha K. Fischer (the Fischers) and Defendant/Third-Party 
Plaintiff-Appellee Anini Aloha Properties, Inc. (Anini Aloha) 
(collectively, Defendants) failed to disclose material facts 
about the Property when they sold it to Adkins. Adkins then 
conveyed the Property to BEG, a limited liability company (LLC) 
whose sole member was Adkins. After Plaintiffs filed their 
Complaint, Defendants filed a Third-Party Complaint for indemnification and contribution against Third-Party Defendants-Appellees Steven Nickens (Nickens), CBIP, Inc., dba Coldwell 
Banker Island Properties (CBIP), Amy J. Marvin (Marvin), and 
Hanalei North Shore Properties, Ltd. (HNSP) (collectively, Third-
Party Defendants). 
Defendants moved to dismiss Plaintiffs' Complaint on 
the grounds that: (1) BEG lacked capacity to commence and 
maintain the lawsuit, because BEG did not have a certificate of authority to transact business in Hawai# i pursuant to HRS chapter 
§ 428-1008 (2004); and (2) Adkins was not a real party in interest, because after conveying the Property to BEG, Adkins had no interest in the Property. CBIP, Nickens, and HNSP joined the motion. The Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit (
Circuit Court) 
agreed with Defendants' arguments and granted the motion to dismiss with prejudice as to Defendants and as to CBIP, Nickens, and HNSP.

Rule 54(b).2/ Plaintiffs also challenge the Circuit Court's 
June 19, 2017 "Order Granting (1) Defendants['] . . . Motion to 
Dismiss Under HRCP Rule 17, Filed on September 29, 2016 [(Motion 
to Dismiss)]; (2) . . . CBIP[ and] Nickens' Substantive Joinder 
in . . . Motion to Dismiss . . . Filed on October 18, 2016; and 
(3) [HNSP's] Joinder and Memorandum in Support of . . . Motion to Dismiss . . . Filed on October 21, 2016" (Dismissal Order). 
On appeal, Plaintiffs contend that the Circuit Court 
erred in: (1) granting the Motion to Dismiss in violation of HRCP Rule 17(a); (2) granting the Motion to Dismiss pursuant to HRS § 428-1008, where BEG obtained a certificate of authority before the Complaint was dismissed; and (3) finding that Adkins was not a real party in interest. 
We hold that the Circuit Court did not violate HRCP 
Rule 17(a) in dismissing BEG's claims against Defendants. HRCP Rule 17(a) allows a real party in interest to ratify the commencement of an action that has not been brought in the name of the party who has the right sought to be enforced. Here, BEG's claims were not dismissed on the basis that it was not a real party in interest; rather, its claims were dismissed because it did not have a certificate of authority when the Complaint was filed, and thus lacked capacity to sue Defendants. In these circumstances, Plaintiffs could not use ratification under HRCP Rule 17(a) to remedy BEG's lack of capacity to sue. 
Additionally, we hold that the Circuit Court did not 
err in dismissing BEG's claims pursuant to HRS § 428-1008(a). We construe that statute to mean that a foreign LLC transacting business in Hawai# i may not commence or continue an action or 
proceeding in the state except when the LLC has a certificate of authority. Further, HRS § 428-1008(a) does not provide an 
2/ We note that Plaintiffs' Complaint did not name Nickens, CBIP,
HNSP, and Marvin as defendants. During a May 17, 2017 hearing on the motion
to dismiss, the Circuit Court orally expressed an intent to dismiss theDefendants' Third-Party Complaint (see infra); however, the Judgment failed todo so. It thus appears that the Third-Party Complaint remains pending beforethe Circuit Court. See Order Den. Nov. 7, 2018 Mot. to Dismiss Appeal, Adkins
v. Fischer, No. CAAP-18-0000409, Judiciary Information Management System dkt.56 at 4 (concluding that the Judgment does not expressly dismiss the Third-Party Complaint, but contains the necessary express finding of "no just reasonfor delay" in entry of the Judgment as to one or more but fewer than allclaims or parties, as HRCP Rule 54(b) requires).

exception when a non-compliant foreign LLC obtains a certificate 
of authority prior to final judgment. 
Here, it is undisputed 
that BEG had no certificate of authority when it commenced this lawsuit, Defendants first raised this deficiency in their answer to the Complaint (Answer), and BEG continued the suit for over 
three years without obtaining a certificate of authority. Under 
these circumstances, BEG could not cure its failure to comply with HRS § 428-1008(a) by obtaining a certificate of authority prior to the hearing on the Motion to Dismiss. 
We further hold, however, that the Circuit Court erred 
in concluding that Adkins was not a real party in interest and in dismissing his claims on that basis. Viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, the facts alleged in the Complaint and the inferences drawn from those facts support a claim that Adkins was fraudulently induced to pay more for the Property than its fair market value and thus suffered damages in an amount to be proved at trial. Adkins therefore asserted a sufficient interest in the action in his own right to make him a real party in interest. 
Accordingly, we affirm in part and vacate in part the 
Judgment and remand the case to the Circuit Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 
I. Background 
On January 28, 2013, Plaintiffs filed their Complaint. 
The Complaint alleged the following operative facts, among others: 
• In 2006, the Fischers listed the Property for sale, describing it, in part, as having a "main house plus guest house." In January 2007, Adkins entered into a Deposit Receipt Offer and Acceptance Form agreement (DROA) with the Fischers to purchase the Property. The 
purchase price was $1.8 million. In the Seller's Real 
Property Disclosure Statement (Disclosure Statement), 
the Fischers failed to disclose that their simultaneous 
leasing of the two structures on the Property as transient vacation rentals "was illegal," and that the 
4 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
smaller structure "was a Workshop, not a dwelling as 
defined by the [Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance (
CZO)]." 
In reliance on the Disclosure Statement, Adkins made additional deposits into escrow and obtained a purchase money loan that was deposited into escrow for the purchase of the Property. Escrow for the transaction closed in March 2007. 
• Thereafter, Adkins conveyed his "entire[] right, title and interest in and to" the Property to BEG. BEG was and is "a duly organized limited liability company under the laws of the State of Illinois, and has its principal place of business in Franklin, Tennessee." Adkins is BEG's "sole and managing member." 
• From 2007 through 2010, Adkins and BEG leased both structures on the Property as transient vacation rentals. In 2010, the County of Kaua# i passed Kaua# i
  
County Ordinance 904, relating to single family transient vacation rentals. Adkins and BEG applied under the ordinance for a permit to allow both structures to be used as nonconforming use transient vacation rentals. During the permit process, in or about July 2011, Adkins and BEG "learned for the first time ever" that their leasing of the two structures as transient vacation rentals "was illegal and in violation of the CZO" and that the smaller structure "was not a dwelling as defined by the CZO, but was instead a Workshop . . . ." The designation of the smaller structure as a workshop caused Adkins "to lose the opportunity to obtain a [nonconforming use transient vacation rental] permit" for the structure and "substantially diminished the fair market value" of the Property at the time of the purchase by Adkins and as of the date of the Complaint. Based on these allegations, the Complaint asserted 
fourteen claims for relief, denominated as follows: 
(1) Civil Conspiracy, alleged against the Fischers and
Anini Aloha; 
5 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2) Fraudulent Concealment, alleged against the
Fischers and Anini Aloha; 
(3) Fraud and/or Negligent Misrepresentation, allegedagainst the Fischers; 
(4) Tortious Interference with Prospective EconomicAdvantage, alleged against the Fischers and AniniAloha; 
(5) Tortious Interference with Contractual Relationships, alleged against the Fischers andAnini Aloha; 
(6) Tortious Interference with Business Relationships,alleged against the Fischers and Anini Aloha; 
(7) Intentional Interference with Economic Relations,alleged against the Fischers and Anini Aloha; 
(8) Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices (in violationof HRS Chapter 480), alleged against the Fischersand Anini Aloha; 
(9) Beach of Contract, alleged against the Fischers; 
(10) 
Breach of the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, alleged against the Fischers; 
(11) Violation of HRS §§ 508D-1 et seq., alleged
against the Fischers; 
(12) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress,
alleged against the Fischers and Anini Aloha; 
(13) Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress,
alleged against the Fischers and Anini Aloha; and 
(14) Attorneys' Fees and Costs, alleged against the
Fischers and Anini Aloha. 
Plaintiffs sought special damages, general damages, punitive 
damages, treble damages under HRS Chapter 480, pre- and post-judgment interest, attorneys' fees and costs. 
On June 3, 2013, Defendants filed their Answer to the 
Complaint. 
The Answer included an affirmative defense alleging 
that "[BEG's] claims are barred because it does not have a certificate of authority to transact business in the State of Hawai#i." 
On September 29, 2016, Defendants filed their Motion to 
Dismiss. 
Defendants argued that under HRS § 428-1008(a), BEG's 
6 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
failure to have a certificate of authority barred it from 
maintaining the action in state court, so it lacked capacity to bring the suit. 
Defendants also argued that after conveying the 
Property to BEG, Adkins had no interest in the Property and was not a real party in interest with the right to assert the claims in the Complaint. Third-Party Defendants CBIP, Nickens, and HNSP filed substantive joinders to the Motion to Dismiss. 
On October 19, 2016, Plaintiffs filed a Memorandum in 
Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss, and on October 24, 2016, Defendants filed a Reply in Support of the Motion to Dismiss. 
On November 10, 2016, Plaintiffs filed a supplemental 
memorandum in opposition to the Motion to Dismiss, arguing that the State's issuance of a certificate of authority to BEG on October 28, 2016, should allow Plaintiffs to continue their action against Defendants. On November 25, 2016, Plaintiffs filed a supplemental brief in support of the Motion to Dismiss, and Plaintiffs filed an additional supplemental opposition to the Motion to Dismiss. 
The Circuit Court heard the Motion to Dismiss and 
joinders on May 17, 2017. Following oral argument by the parties, the court stated in relevant part: 
Counsel, the Court has read the motion to dismiss, the
opposition, the reply, the joinders that were filed, and Ibelieve it's quite clear on its face this Court is inagreement with the arguments that were raised by thedefendants. 
Based on your respective pleadings and arguments, this
Court is granting the motion to dismiss and this wouldinclude the dismissal of the third-party complaints as well. 
On June 19, 2017, the Circuit Court entered the 
Dismissal Order, and on May 8, 2018, the Circuit Court entered 
the Judgment. This appeal followed. 
II. Standards of Review 
A. Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings 
Although styled as a "Motion to Dismiss Under HRCP Rule 
17," the Motion to Dismiss should be treated as a motion for 
7   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
judgment on the pleadings pursuant to HRCP Rule 12(c).3/ See Ruf 
v. Honolulu Police Dept., 89 Hawai# i 315, 319, 972 P.2d 1081, 
1085 (1999). 
We review a circuit court's order granting a motion for 
judgment on the pleadings de novo.  See In re Office of 
Information Practices Opinion Letter No. F16-01, 147 Hawai# i 286, 
294, 465 P.3d 733, 741 (2020) (citing Hawai# i Med. Ass'n v. 
Hawai#i Med. Serv. Ass'n, 113 Hawai# i 77, 91, 148 P.3d 1179, 1193 
(2006)). 
In a motion for judgment on the pleadings under HRCP Rule
12(c), the movant must clearly establish that no material 
3/ Defendants purported to bring the Motion to Dismiss "pursuant to
Rule 17 of the [HRCP.]" As to Defendants' argument that BEG lacked capacityto maintain the lawsuit, under HRCP Rule 9(a), a party who wishes to raise anissue as to capacity must do so by "specific negative averment, which shallinclude such supporting particulars as are peculiarly within the pleader'sknowledge." Here, Defendants' Answer included an affirmative defense allegingthat BEG's claims were barred because BEG did not have a certificate of authority. See 5A Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice
and Procedure: Civil § 1294 (4th ed.) (construing analogous Federal Rules ofCivil Procedure ( FRCP) Rule 9(a): "Although the specific denial as to a
party's capacity, authority, or legal existence required by [FRCP] Rule 9(a)may not be regarded by some — strictly speaking — as an affirmative defense,courts tend to treat it that way.") The issue of BEG's capacity to maintainthe lawsuit was also properly raised by a pretrial motion. See id. ("A
specific denial of capacity, authority, or legal existence should be made inthe responsive pleading or, if the lack of capacity, authority, or legalexistence issue appears on the face of the pleadings or is discernibletherefrom, the issue can be raised by a motion to dismiss for failure to statea claim for relief. A motion to strike, a motion for judgment on thepleadings, or a motion for summary judgment may also be employed to raisecapacity challenges, although parties must be careful to avoid waiver."(footnotes omitted)). 
As to Defendants' argument that Adkins was not a real party in
interest, "a HRCP Rule 17(a) objection may be made in [a defendant's] answeras an affirmative defense or by a pretrial motion." Lagondino v. Maldonado, 7
Haw. App. 591, 596, 789 P.2d 1129, 1132 (1990) (citing 6A Charles Alan Wright,Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 2d§ 1554 (1990)); see 6A Wright, Miller & Kane, supra (3d ed. 2010) (construinganalogous FRCP Rule 17(a): "[A] real-party-in-interest objection closelyresembles the defense of failure to state a claim for relief because it presupposes that plaintiff does not have the substantive right to enforce theclaim being made. Treated as a Rule 12(b)(6) defense, it can be raised eitherby motion or in the answer." (footnote omitted)); Siemens USA Holdings, Inc.v. U.S., 960 F. Supp. 2d 221, 223-24 (D.D.C. 2013) ("[A] motion to dismissunder [FRCP] Rule 12(b)(6) is one proper method of bringing [a real-party-in-interest] issue to the Court. 'A real-party-in-interest defense can be raisedas a Rule 12(b)(6) motion because the plaintiff is not the person who shouldbe bringing the suit,' and thus, 'the plaintiff has failed to state a claimupon which relief can be granted.'" (original brackets and ellipsis omitted)(quoting Whelan v. Abell, 953 F.2d 663, 672 (D.C. Cir. 1992))). 
Here, the pleadings were closed when Defendants filed the Motion
to Dismiss. Accordingly, the motion is properly viewed as a motion forjudgment on the pleadings pursuant to HRCP Rule 12(c).

issue of fact remains to be resolved and that they are
entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In considering amotion for judgment on the pleadings, the trial court isrequired to view the facts presented in the pleadings andthe inferences to be drawn therefrom in the light mostfavorable to the nonmoving party. 
Our task on appeal is to determine whether the circuit
court's order supports its conclusion that the movant isentitled to judgment as a matter of law and, by implication,that it appears beyond a doubt that the nonmoving party canprove no set of facts in support of its claim that wouldentitle it to relief under any alternative theory.

B. Statutory Interpretation 
"The interpretation of a statute is a question of law 
reviewable de novo." McLaren v. Paradise Inn Hawaii LLC, 132 
Hawai#i 320, 327, 321 P.3d 671, 678 (2014) (citing Lindinha v. 
Hilo Coast Processing Co., 104 Hawai# i 164, 171, 86 P.3d 973, 980 
(2004)). When construing a statute, we apply the following well-
settled principles: 
We first examine the language of the statute itself. If the 
language is plain and unambiguous, we must give effect toits plain and obvious meaning. Also, implicit in statutoryconstruction is our foremost obligation to ascertain andgive effect to the intention of the legislature, which isobtained primarily from the language of the statute itself.Finally, when there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, orindistinctiveness or uncertainty of an expression used in astatute, an ambiguity exists. When there is ambiguity, themeaning of ambiguous words may be sought by examining thecontext or resorting to extrinsic aids to determinelegislative intent. 
State v. Carlton, 146 Hawai# i 16, 22, 455 P.3d 356, 362 (2019)

Reckless Dev. v. Zoning Bd. of Appeals, 114 Hawai# i 184, 194, 159 
P.3d 143, 153 (2007)). Additionally, as relevant here, the Hawai#i legislature has directed that "[a]ll provisions of 
uniform acts adopted by the State shall be so interpreted and construed as to effectuate their general purpose and to make uniform the laws of the states and territories which enact them."HRS § 1–24 (2009).

III. Discussion 
A. "Ratification" Under HRCP Rule 17(a) 
Relying on HRCP Rule 17(a), Plaintiffs contend that the 
Circuit Court should have "permitt[ed them] to ratify the action 
by obtaining the certificate of authority" after the Complaint was filed. 
Plaintiffs argue that allowing ratification under 
Rule 17(a) "would not have affected the original complaint's factual allegations as to the events or the parties and would in no way prejudice the Defendants." In response, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs "misunderstand[] . . . the distinction between [BEG's] statutory lack of capacity, which required dismissal of its Complaint, and the real party in interest requirement, which was irrelevant to the dismissal as to [BEG]." 
The legal concepts of real party in interest and 
capacity to sue, though both addressed by HRCP Rule 17, are distinct. HRCP Rule 17(a) provides, in relevant part: 
Rule 17. PARTIES PLAINTIFF AND DEFENDANT; CAPACITY. 
(a) Real party in interest.  Every action shall be
prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest . . . .
No action shall be dismissed on the ground that it is notprosecuted in the name of the real party in interest until areasonable time has been allowed after objection forratification of commencement of the action by, or joinder orsubstitution of, the real party in interest; and suchratification, joinder, or substitution shall have the sameeffect as if the action had been commenced in the name of the real party in interest. 
See Kahala Royal Corp. v. Goodsill Anderson Quinn & Stifel, 113 
Hawai#i 251, 279, 151 P.3d 732, 760 (2007) ("HRCP Rule 17(a) 
. . . requires the prosecution of an action 'in the name of the party who, by the substantive law, has the right sought to be enforced[.]'" (footnote omitted) (quoting Lagondino, 7 Haw. App. at 596, 789 P.2d at 1132)); 6A Wright, Miller & Kane, supra § 1542 (construing analogous FRCP Rule 17(a): "[T]he real-party-in-interest principle is a means to identify the person who possesses the right sought to be enforced."). 
HRCP Rule 17(c), on the other hand, allows the trial 
court to appoint a next friend or guardian ad litem for a minor or "incompetent person," i.e., a person lacking legal capacity to 
10 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
sue, for purposes of prosecuting a lawsuit. See Leslie v. Estate 
of Tavares, 91 Hawai# i 394, 400, 984 P.2d 1220, 1226 (1999); see 
also Moore v. Matthew's Book Co.
, 597 F.2d 645, 647 (8th Cir. 
1979) ("The question of capacity to sue is whether the person 
bringing the suit has authority to use the courts of that jurisdiction." (citing Basch v. Talley Indus., Inc., 53 F.R.D. 9 (S.D.N.Y. 1971))); 6A Wright, Miller & Kane, supra, § 1542 ("capacity is conceived to be a party's personal right to litigate in a federal court"). Thus, it is possible to be the real party in interest and yet lack capacity to sue because, for example, the party is a minor or has become mentally incompetent, see 6A Wright, Miller & Kane, supra, § 1542, or is a business entity that lacks the statutory authority to sue, see, e.g., In re Village of Chestnut Ridge v. Town of Ramapo, 45 A.D.3d 74, 80 (N.Y. App. Div. 2007). 
Here, the Motion to Dismiss did not assert, and the 
Circuit Court did not rule, that BEG was not a real party in interest under HRCP Rule 17(a). Rather, Defendants argued and the Circuit Court agreed that BEG lacked capacity to bring suit against Defendants because BEG did not have a certificate of authority under HRS chapter 428 when the Complaint was filed. Plaintiffs cite no authority, and we have found none, suggesting that "ratification" under HRCP Rule 17(a) can be used to remedy a plaintiff's lack of legal capacity to sue. Thus, the Circuit Court did not violate HRCP Rule 17(a) in dismissing BEG's claims against Defendants. The dispositive issue, which we address below, is whether BEG lacked capacity to "maintain an action or proceeding" against Defendants pursuant to HRS § 428-1008(a) prior to dismissal of the Complaint. 
B. Failure to Obtain a Certificate of Authority 
Plaintiffs contend that the Circuit Court erred in 
granting the Motion to Dismiss pursuant to HRS chapter 428, where 
BEG had obtained a certificate of authority before the motion was heard, thus "cur[ing]" BEG's initial failure to comply with the "registration requirements" of chapter 428. Plaintiffs further argue that nothing in the statute or its legislative history 
11   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
reflects an intent "to revoke the [capacity] of a foreign LLC to 
file suit if a foreign LLC fails to obtain a certificate of authority prior to the commencement of the action." 
In response, 
Defendants argue that HRS § 428-1008(a) prevents an LLC that has failed to obtain a certificate of authority from commencing or continuing an action in this state, and that the legislature did not intend to allow a foreign LLC to cure such a failure after commencing litigation. 
Hawaii's Uniform Limited Liability Company Act (LLC 
Act), HRS chapter 428, is "based in significant part on the 
Uniform Limited Liability Company Act [(ULLCA)] adopted in 1994 
by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State 
Laws[.]" Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 82 on S.B. No. 2723, in 1996 House Journal, at 996-97, in 1996 Senate Journal, at 778-79. HRS § 428-1002 (Supp. 2021) allows foreign LLCs
4/ to obtain a 
certificate of authority to transact business in Hawai# i.  HRS 
§ 428-1008 addresses the effects of an LLC's failure to obtain such a certificate. As set forth below, the failure of a foreign LLC to have a certificate of authority does not prevent that LLC from "defending" an action or proceeding in 
Hawai#i, but does 
prevent it from "maintaining" an action or proceeding in the state: 
§ 428-1008 Effect of failure to obtain certificate of 
authority. (a) A foreign limited liability company
transacting business in this State may not maintain an
action or proceeding in this State unless it has acertificate of authority to transact business in this State. 
(b) The failure of a foreign limited liability
company to have a certificate of authority to transactbusiness in this State does not impair the validity of acontract or act of the company or prevent the foreignlimited liability company from defending an action orproceeding in this State. 
(c) Limitations on the personal liability of
managers, members, and their transferees are not waivedsolely by transacting business in this State without acertificate of authority. 
(d) If a foreign limited liability company transacts
business in this State without a certificate of authority, 
4/ A foreign LLC is defined as "an unincorporated entity organized
under laws other than the laws of this State which afford limited liability toits owners comparable to the liability under [HRS] section 428-303 and is notrequired to obtain a certificate of authority to transact business under anylaw of this State other than this chapter." HRS § 428-101 (2004). 
12  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
service of process may be made upon the company as set forth
in section 428-110(b) at any address used by the company asits address for purposes of its business transactions. 
(e) A foreign limited liability company which
transacts business in this State without a certificate of authority, shall be liable to the State in an amount equalto all fees and penalties which would have been imposed bythis chapter upon that foreign limited liability company hadit obtained such a certificate and filed all records and reports required by this chapter. The attorney general maybring proceedings to recover all amounts due this Stateunder the provisions of this section. 
(Emphases added). 
Here, there is no dispute that BEG was a foreign LLC 
transacting business in Hawai# i subject to the provisions of HRS 
§ 428-1008. 
Additionally, Plaintiffs appear to concede that when 
they filed their Complaint, BEG did not have a certificate of 
authority. Plaintiffs argue, however, that HRS § 428-1008(a) bars only "maintaining" an action in these circumstances, which Plaintiffs construe as a bar on "continuing" rather than "commencing" an action. Plaintiffs further argue that before the Motion to Dismiss was heard, BEG obtained a certificate of authority, allowing it to continue its suit against Defendants and rendering the Motion to Dismiss moot. 
Defendants, on the other hand, argue that "[t]he phrase 
'maintain an action' means 'the commencement of an action or the continuation of an action already begun[,]'" as stated in P.K. Springfield, Inc. v. Hogan
, 621 N.E.2d 1253, 1258 (Ohio 1993) 
(citing Black's Law Dictionary 859 (5th ed. Rev. 1979)). Defendants construe HRS § 428-1008(a) to mean that, "except when a foreign LLC possesses a certificate of authority, it cannot commence or continue an action in State courts." Defendants argue that because BEG did not have a certificate of authority when it filed suit, it lacked capacity to sue them, and the plain language of HRS § 428-1008 precludes a foreign LLC from "curing" that lack of capacity by later obtaining a certificate of authority. 
Pursuant to HRS § 428-1008(a), a foreign LLC such as 
BEG may not "maintain an action or proceeding" in Hawai# i "unless 
it has a certificate of authority . . . ."

Black's Law Dictionary includes multiple definitions of 
"maintain," including the definition relied on by Plaintiffs, 
"[t]o continue (something)." Black's Law Dictionary 1142 (11th 
ed. 2019). But Black's also defines "maintain" as "[t]o assert (a position or opinion)[,]" id., lending support to Defendants' position that the phrase "maintain an action" means "the commencement of an action or the continuation of an action already begun." These differing definitions suggest ambiguity in the phrase "maintain an action or proceeding." 
Black's does not define "unless," but Webster's does. 
"Unless" means "except under the circumstances that[.]" Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary 2080 (1996 ed.). The same source defines "have" as "to possess[,]" which fits the context of HRS § 428-1008. Id. at 877. 
To the extent there is ambiguity in the phrase 
"maintain an action or proceeding," we may examine the legislative history of HRS chapter 428. As Plaintiffs point out, the purpose of the LLC Act was to allow for the formation of LLCs in Hawai# i, with the goal of "provid[ing] an attractive incentive 
for new businesses to be established in the State" and "promot[ing] economic development in the State." Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 82 on S.B. No. 2723, in 1996 House Journal, at 996-97, in 1996 Senate Journal, at 778-79. 
Although the legislative 
history does not spell out the specific purpose of HRS 
5/ The language of HRS § 428-1008(a) is identical to that of ULLCA 
§ 1008(a). The ULLCA also does not define the quoted phrases. 
14   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
§ 428-1008, it is reasonable to infer based on the section's 
plain language that the legislature intended to encourage foreign LLCs doing business in 
Hawai#i to obtain certificates of 
authority before seeking affirmative relief in the state's courts. 
In construing the phrase "maintain an action or 
proceeding," we may also examine HRS § 428-1008 in the context of HRS § 414-432 (2004), which addresses the consequences of a foreign corporation's failure to obtain a certificate of authority to transact business in Hawai# i pursuant to HRS § 414-
432. See Omiya, 142 Hawai# i at 450, 420 P.3d at 381 ("What is 
clear in one statute may be called upon in aid to explain what is doubtful in another.'" (quoting State v. Kamana# o, 118 Hawai# i 
210, 218, 188 P.3d 724, 732 (2008)). HRS § 414-432 states, in relevant part: 
Consequences of transacting business without
authority.  (a) A foreign corporation transacting business
in this State without a certificate of authority may not
maintain a proceeding in any court in this State until itobtains a certificate of authority. 
. . . . 
(c) A court may 
stay a proceeding commenced by a
foreign corporation, its successor, or assignee until itdetermines whether the foreign corporation or its successorrequires a certificate of authority. If it so determines,the court may further stay the proceeding until the foreigncorporation or its successor obtains the certificate. 
. . . . 
(e) Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b), the
failure of a foreign corporation to obtain a certificate ofauthority does not impair the validity of its corporate actsor prevent it from defending any proceeding in this State. 
(Emphases added.) 
HRS § 414-432(a) substantially mirrors HRS § 
428-1008(a) to the extent that both a foreign LLC and a foreign 
corporation transacting business in Hawai# i without a certificate 
of authority may not "maintain" a "proceeding"6/ in Hawai# i

follows:

"unless" (in the case of a foreign LLC) or "until" (in the case 
of a foreign corporation) the entity obtains a certificate of authority. However, in contrast to HRS § 428-1008, HRS § 414-432 includes an express stay and cure provision, i.e., HRS § 414-432(c), which authorizes a court to stay a proceeding "commenced" by a foreign corporation without a required certificate of authority "until" the corporation (or its successor) obtains the certificate. Such a stay and cure provision would presumably not be necessary but for the effect of HRS § 414-432(a) on the corporation's capacity to commence as well as to continue the proceeding without a certificate of authority. Stated differently, a court would not need to stay a proceeding "commenced" by a foreign corporation without a certificate of authority if such corporation had the capacity to commence the proceeding and merely had to obtain the requisite certificate at some point prior to judgment or other termination of the proceeding. Comparing HRS § 428-1008 to HRS § 414-432 thus supports the conclusion that the phrase "maintain an action or proceeding" means the commencement or continuation of an action or proceeding.

"'Proceeding' is a word much used to express the
business done in courts. A proceeding in court is anact done by the authority or direction of the court,express or implied. It is more comprehensive than theword 'action,' but it may include in its general senseall the steps taken or measures adopted in theprosecution or defense of an action, including thepleadings and judgment. . . ." 
Black's Law Dictionary at 1457 (quoting John W. Salmond, Essays inJurisprudence and Legal History 3-4 (1891)); see id. (further describing theterm "action," making it clear that an "action" also means a lawsuit broughtin court). 
7/ Defendants also correctly observe that the Hawai #i legislature has
used the phrase "maintain an action" in other contexts seemingly to indicatethe commencement, as well as the continuation, of an action. See, e.g., HRS
§ 663-3(a) (2016) ("When the death of a person is caused by the wrongful act .. . of any person, the deceased's legal representative . . . may maintain anaction against the person causing the death . . . ."); HRS § 668-8.5 (2016)

Comparing these two statutes also sheds light on 
Plaintiffs' argument that BEG "cured" its initial failure to 
comply with HRS § 428-1008(a) by obtaining a certificate of authority prior to the hearing on the Motion to Dismiss. 
HRS 
§ 414-432 prohibits a foreign corporation without a certificate of authority from maintaining a proceeding "until" it obtains a certificate. (Emphasis added.) When used as a conjunction, "until" means "up to the time that or when[.]" Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary, supra, at 2089; see Capital City Energy Group, Inc. V. Kelley Drye & Warren LLP, No. 2:11-cv-00207, 2011 WL 5175617, at *4 (S.D. Ohio Oct. 31, 2011) ("The meaning of the word 'until' provides an inference that a proceeding may be continued once a foreign corporation obtains a license."). HRS § 414-432 also expressly provides a foreign corporation an opportunity to cure a lack of certificate, by authorizing the court to stay a proceeding to determine if the corporation requires a certificate of authority and, if it does, to continue the stay "until the foreign corporation . . . obtains the certificate." HRS § 414-432(c) (emphasis added). 
By contrast, HRS § 428-1008(a) uses the word "unless" 
rather than "until," and includes no provision for a stay pending an LLC's obtaining a certificate. The legislature's use of the word "until" in HRS § 414-432, along with the express stay and cure provision, reflects the legislative intent to allow a foreign corporation to cure, during the pendency of a proceeding, a failure to obtain a certificate before filing suit. The same intent is not reflected in the language of HRS § 428-1008. Had the legislature intended to afford foreign LLCs the same

opportunity to cure their non-compliance with state law in this 
context, it presumably would have done so. See, e.g.
, Lanai Co. 
v. Land Use Comm'n, 105 Hawai# i 296, 318, 97 P.3d 372, 394 (2004) 
("If the legislature intended to grant the LUC enforcement powers it could have expressly provided the LUC with such power."); Morgan v. Planning Dep't, County of Kaua# i, 104 Hawai# i 173, 188, 
86 P.3d 982, 997 (2004) (ruling that if the legislature had intended to grant the commission injunctive powers, it would have done so expressly). 
Case law in other jurisdictions with LLC statutes 
similar to HRS § 428-1008 also undermines Plaintiffs' cure argument. For example, in Sta-Rite Industries, LLC v. Preferred Pump & Equipment, No. 5:08 CV 1072, 2008 WL 3874676 (N.D. Ohio Aug. 14, 2008), the court applied an Ohio statute providing that "a foreign [LLC] transacting business in [Ohio] may not maintain any action or proceeding in any court of this state until it has registered in this state in accordance with [various code sections]." Id. at *1 (original brackets omitted) (quoting Ohio 
Rev. Code § 1705.58(A) (since repealed)). The court dismissed the action, holding that the law required "a [LLC] to register pursuant to [statute] before filing an action in Ohio and that failure to do so cannot be cured by subsequent registration." Id. at *3; see Blues Events, LLC v. Lincoln Prof'l Baseball, Inc., No. 4:13-CV-3101, 2014 WL 347059, at *3 (D. Neb. Jan. 30, 2014) (holding that under Nebraska's Limited Liability Company Act, which contains language identical to HRS section 428-1008(a), the plaintiff, lacking a certificate of authority, "lacks capacity under Nebraska law to bring these claims in Nebraska.").

statute providing that "no foreign corporation which should have obtained such
license shall maintain any action in any court until it has obtained suchlicense." 621 N.E.2d at 1256 (emphasis omitted) (quoting Ohio Rev. Code§ 1703.29(A)). The court held:

Plaintiffs' reliance on Nolte v. MT Tech. Enters., LLC, 
726 S.E.2d 339 (Va. 2012), and A Guy Named Moe, LLC v. Chipotle 
Mexican Grill of Colo., LLC, 135 A.3d 492 (Md. 2016), is misplaced. Both cases are readily distinguishable from this one, based on the differing language of the controlling LLC statutes, which the courts construed as allowing a non-compliant foreign LLC to "cure" its failure to comply with state registration requirements. 
In Nolte, the Virginia LLC statute stated that "a 
foreign limited liability company transacting business in the Commonwealth may not maintain any action, suit, or proceeding in any court of the Commonwealth until it has registered in the Commonwealth." 726 S.E.2d at 345 (original emphasis and brackets omitted) (quoting Va. Code Ann. § 13.1-1057(A)). The court relied on a prior case construing similar language in a statute that imposed a registration requirement on a foreign corporation. In the prior case, the court reasoned in part that the language "takes no right away from the offending party after compliance. When its terms are met, the barriers theretofore existing are removed." Id. (emphasis added). Although the court in Nolte also construed "maintain" as meaning to continue rather than to commence, it appears that the statute's use of the phrase "until it has registered" led the court to conclude that an LLC could cure a failure to comply with registration requirements during litigation. Cf. Capital City Energy Group, Inc., 2011 WL 
5175617, at *4 ("The meaning of . . . 'until' provides an inference that a proceeding may be continued once a foreign corporation obtains a license."). 
In A Guy Named Moe, the applicable statute explicitly 
allowed a foreign LLC to cure a previous failure to comply with registration requirements. The statute stated that if a foreign LLC does business in Maryland without complying with registration 
procure the required license prior to maintaining an action
violates [the statute] and may be a sufficient basis for ajudicial remedy for that violation, regardless of whetherthe corporation obtains a license prior to final judgment.

requirements, the LLC "may not maintain suit in any court of this 
State, 
unless the limited liability company shows to the 
satisfaction of the court" that the LLC has paid the specified penalty and registered, or that it is no longer doing business in the state. 135 A.3d at 498 (quoting Md. Code Ann., Corps. & Ass'ns § 4A–1007(a) (2007)) (emphasis added)). The court interpreted "maintain" as meaning "to continue" because that word, "coupled with 'unless the limited liability company shows to the satisfaction of the court,' indicate[d] that the Legislature intended to permit a noncompliant foreign [LLC] to 'cure' its failure to comply with registration requirements, even though having failed to register before filing suit." 135 A.3d at 499 (emphasis added). In contrast to the Maryland statute, which deprives a foreign LLC of capacity to maintain an action in the state unless the LLC makes a showing of certification and satisfaction of penalties during the course of litigation, the Hawai#i LLC statute deprives a foreign LLC of such capacity 
unless it has a certificate of authority, i.e.
, without a similar 
cure provision.9/ 
Based on the plain language of HRS § 428-1008(a), its 
context and implicit purpose, our examination of the similarities and distinctions between HRS § 428-1008 and HRS § 414-432, and our review of case law in other jurisdictions with similar statutes, we construe HRS § 428-1008(a) to mean that a foreign LLC transacting business in Hawai# i may not commence or continue 
an action or proceeding in the state except when the LLC has a certificate of authority. Thus, the commencement or continuation 
9/ Other cases cited by Plaintiffs also involved statutes with
language materially different from the language of HRS § 428-1008(a). See,

Dist. Ct. App. 2017) (construing Florida statute providing that "[a] court maystay a proceeding commenced by a foreign limited liability company or itssuccessor or assignee until it determines whether the foreign limitedliability company or its successor requires a certificate of authority" andthat "the court may further stay the proceeding until the foreign limitedliability company or its successor obtains the certificate."

of an action by a non-compliant foreign LLC violates HRS § 
428-1008(a) and subjects the action to dismissal. 
Furthermore, 
the statute does not provide an exception where the non-compliant foreign LLC obtains a certificate of authority prior to final judgment. 
Here, there is no dispute that BEG had no certificate 
of authority when it commenced this lawsuit, Defendants first raised this deficiency in their Answer, and BEG continued the suit for over three years without obtaining a certificate of authority. Under these circumstances, BEG could not cure its failure to comply with HRS § 428-1008(a) by obtaining a certificate of authority prior to the hearing on the Motion to Dismiss. Accordingly, the Circuit Court did not err in granting the Motion to Dismiss pursuant to HRS § 428-1008.
10/ 
C. Whether Adkins Was a Real Party in Interest 
Plaintiffs contend that the Circuit Court erred in 
determining that Adkins was not a real party in interest. Plaintiffs argue that this action stems from the original sale of the Property to Adkins, and that as a result of Defendants' alleged breach of contract and tortious conduct, Adkins "suffered the damages from the loss in value of the . . . Property and loss of income generated by his rentals." Plaintiffs also argue that the Circuit Court should have granted their request for leave to amend the Complaint to allow Adkins to transfer the Property from BEG back to Adkins "to avoid the dismissal of the Complaint." 
In response, Defendants contend that Adkins is not a 
real party in interest "because the claimed damages arise from an alleged loss of rental income, which accrued to [BEG] alone." According to Defendants, "[v]iewing the Complaint's allegations 
10/ We note that Plaintiffs do not contend that the Circuit Court 
erred in dismissing the Complaint with prejudice, rather than without
prejudice, pursuant to HRS § 428-1008, such that BEG might have re-filed theaction following dismissal. See Corco, Inc. v. Ledar Transport, Inc., 946
P.2d 1009, 1010 (Kan. Ct. App. 1997) ("[T]he proper remedy was to dismiss [theunregistered entity's] counterclaim without prejudice rather than withprejudice. This would leave [the entity] the opportunity to comply with thestatutes and then reassert its claim against [the defendant]. On the other hand, it would also leave the risk that the statute of limitations might runagainst [the entity]."). Accordingly, we do not decide whether the properremedy in these circumstances was to dismiss BEG's claims without prejudice.

in the light most favorable to [Plaintiffs], the alleged economic 
losses resulted from an alleged inability to legally rent the second structure on the Property beginning in 2011[,]" and these alleged losses were those of BEG as a distinct legal entity and the sole owner of the Property. 
As previously stated, the real-party-in-interest 
principle is a means to identify the party who has the right sought to be enforced. See Kahala Royal Corp., 113 Hawai# i at 
279, 151 P.3d at 760.; see also
 6A Wright, et al., supra, § 1542 
("[T]he term [real party in interest] directs attention to whether plaintiff has a significant interest in the particular action plaintiff has instituted[.]"). "The rationale of [HRCP] [R]ule [17a] is to protect the defendant from a multiplicity of suits, to allow defendant to present all [its] defenses, to protect defendant from multiple liability." Lagondino, 7 Haw. 
App. at 596, 789 P.2d at 1132 (citing Pace v. General Elec. Co., 55 F.R.D. 215, 218 (W.D. Pa. 1972)). 
Here, the Complaint alleges, among other things, that: 
(1) Adkins entered into the DROA with the Fischers to purchase the Property; (2) the Fischers were obligated to disclose to Adkins any fact, defect, or condition that would be expected to measurably affect the value of the Property; (3) the Fischers failed to disclose that their simultaneous leasing of the two structures on the Property as transient vacation rentals "was illegal," and that the smaller structure "was a Workshop, not a dwelling as defined by the CZO"; (4) in reliance on the Fischers' representations and disclosures, Adkins purchased the Property for $1.8 million; and (5) the "Workshop designation on the [smaller structure] substantially diminished the fair market value" of the Property at the time of the purchase by Adkins. Based on these allegations, the Complaint further asserts, for example, that: (1) Defendants' purpose was to "fraudulently induce [Adkins] to pay substantially in excess of the actual fair market value of the . . . Property"; (2) in reliance on the Fischers' false representations, Adkins placed additional funds into escrow, did not exercise his right to cancel the DROA, and borrowed money to close the sale of the Property; and (3) as a 
22  
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
result of the Fishers' breaches of the DROA and Disclosure 
Statement and other wrongful conduct, Adkins (and BEG) have been damaged "in an amount to be proved at trial." 
Viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, the 
facts alleged in the Complaint and the inferences drawn from those facts support a claim, among others, that Adkins was fraudulently induced to pay more for the Property than its fair market value and thus suffered damages in an amount to be proved at trial. 
Adkins therefore asserted a sufficient interest in the 
action in his own right to make him a real party in interest. Accordingly, the Circuit Court erred in concluding that Adkins was not a real party in interest and in dismissing his claims on that basis.

IV. Conclusion 
For the reasons discussed above, we affirm in part and 
vacate in part the May 8, 2018 Judgment, entered by the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit. The Judgment is affirmed to the extent that the Circuit Court dismissed the claims in the Complaint asserted by Plaintiff-Appellant Brown Eyed Girl, LLC. The Judgment is vacated to the extent that the Circuit Court dismissed the claims in the Complaint asserted by Plaintiff-Appellant Richard K. Adkins. The case is remanded to the Circuit Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

on the allegations of the Complaint, we need not address Defendants'alternative arguments. Similarly, because Adkins is a real party in interest,we need not decide the extent to which, if any, Adkins can claim damagesarising from the alleged loss of rental income as his own.
