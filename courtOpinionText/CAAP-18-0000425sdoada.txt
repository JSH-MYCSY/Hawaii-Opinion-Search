STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
ALTON JOSEPH EXZABE, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(WAIANAE DIVISION)
(CASE NO. 1DCW-18-0000356) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Alton Joseph Exzabe (Exzabe) 
appeals from the May 4, 2018 Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or 
Order entered by the District Court of the First Circuit, Waianae Division (District Court).
1 After a bench trial, Exzabe was 
convicted of Sexual Assault in the Fourth Degree in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes § 707-733(1)(a) (2014). 
Exzabe raises four points of error on appeal, 
contending that: 
(1) the District Court erred in accepting 
Exzabe's purported waiver of his right to a jury trial; (2 & 3) the District Court violated Exzabe's constitutional rights regarding self-incrimination, assistance of counsel, and due

process, by forcing Exzabe to decide whether he would testify 
before the defense witnesses testified and by requiring that the parties complete the presentation of evidence in a single day; and (4) Exzabe was deprived of his right to effective assistance of counsel due to several errors and omissions of trial counsel. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve Exzabe's points of error as follows: 
The Hawai# i Supreme Court recently reiterated the 
standard applicable to a waiver of the right to a jury trial: 
It is well established that Hawai #i law recognizes the
right to a jury trial as a fundamental right. 
State v. 
Ibuos, 75 Haw. 118, 120, 857 P.2d 576, 577 (1993). This 
right cannot be relinquished absent a knowing, intelligent,and voluntary waiver. State v. Friedman, 93 Hawai #i 63, 68,
996 P.2d 268, 273 (2000). A waiver is knowing andintelligent when it is made with "full awareness of both thenature of the right being abandoned and the consequences ofthe decision to abandon it." Moran v. Burbine, 475 U.S.412, 421 (1986). A waiver is voluntary when 'it was theproduct of a free and deliberate choice rather thanintimidation, coercion, or deception.' Id. 
When determining whether the waiver of a jury trial is
knowing, intelligent, and voluntary, we have "advised thetrial courts to conduct Duarte-Higareda's suggestedcolloquy[.]" State v. Gomez-Lobato, 130 Hawai #i 465, 470,
312 P.3d 897, 902 (2013) (citing Friedman, 93 
Hawai #i at 69,
996 P.2d at 274). In a Duarte-Higareda colloquy, the trialcourt informs the defendant "that (1) twelve members of thecommunity compose a jury, (2) the defendant may take part injury selection, (3) a jury verdict must be unanimous, and(4) the court alone decides guilt or innocence if thedefendant waives a jury trial." United States v. Duarte-Higareda, 113 F.3d 1000, 1002 (9th Cir. 1997). Here,the circuit court engaged Torres in a colloquy thatessentially tracked the suggested Duarte-Higareda model. However, the Duarte-Higareda colloquy does not addresswhether a waiver is voluntary. 
Torres argues that the circuit court was required to
specifically ask him whether the waiver was his own decisionor "based upon duress or the influence of another person orother factors that might cause him to waive his rightsagainst his will." Without conducting this inquiry, Torres
asserts, the circuit court had no basis for its finding thatthe jury waiver was voluntary. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
This court has evaluated the voluntariness requirement
of a waiver of a jury trial on several occasions. In 
Friedman, the trial court asked the defendant during thecolloquy, "Is your decision to waive your right to jurytrial something you thought about and decided to do yourselfvoluntarily[?]" and the defendant answered, "Yes."¨ 93Hawai #i at 66, 996 P.2d at 271. We found the defendant's 
waiver to be voluntary because the defendant "affirmativelyindicated to the trial court that his waiver of the right toa jury trial was voluntary and a result of his ownreflection." Id. at 70, 996 P.2d at 275. 
State v. Torres, SCWC-16-0000673, slip op. at 5 (Haw. Apr. 10, 
2019) (footnotes omitted). 
Here, the District Court engaged Exzabe in a colloquy 
that essentially tracked the suggested Duarte-Higareda model. However, as the supreme court stated above, the Duarte-Higareda colloquy does not address whether a waiver is voluntary. The District Court relied on the written waiver form that was before the court; the court did not ask Exzabe whether he signed the form, did not ask Exzabe whether he was waiving his right to a jury trial voluntarily, and did not otherwise offer Exzabe an opportunity to ask questions or affirmatively indicate that his waiver of a jury trial was a reflection of his own free will. Cf. Torres, slip op. at 6-7. Notwithstanding Exzabe's good English language skills and college degree, there was no direct question to Exzabe about voluntariness and nothing else in the colloquy to indicate that the decision to waive his right to a jury trial was of Exzabe's own free will and deliberate choice. Based on the totality of the facts and circumstances of the record in this case, we cannot conclude that Exzabe's waiver of his right to jury trial was voluntary.
