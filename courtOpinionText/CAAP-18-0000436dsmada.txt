APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 3CC17100106K) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL 
(By:  Chan, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Upon review of the supplemental memorandum filed by 
Defendant-Appellant Association of Apartment Owners of Waikoloa 
Hills Condominium (AOAO) on October 5, 2020, and the record in 
these consolidated appeals, it appears that: 
1. The AOAO nonjudicially foreclosed its lien and 
became the owner of the subject property (Property) more than one 
year before the mortgage foreclosure complaint below was filed by 
Plaintiff-Appellee Wilmington Trust, National Association (Wilmington); 
2. The circuit court granted Wilmington's motion for 
summary judgment; appointed a Commissioner to take possession and 
control of the Property, collect rent payments, and sell the 
Property at public auction; entered a Judgment of Foreclosure; 
and retained jurisdiction to determine whether the AOAO was 
entitled to a special assessment under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 514B-146; 
3. The AOAO filed these appeals, contending that the 
circuit court erred by denying the AOAO's request "to continue to maintain possession of the Property, manage and preserve the Property, and if appropriate, continue to rent the Property until completion of the current foreclosure action"; 
4. While these consolidated appeals were pending, the 
Commissioner filed a report with the circuit court stating, among other things, that he "collected no rent or other monies ($0.00) in connection with his duties regarding the Property"; 
5. On October 29, 2019, Wilmington filed a motion for 
an order confirming the foreclosure sale of the Property;

6. On November 13, 2019, the AOAO filed a response to 
Wilmington's motion to confirm, stating that "the Commissioner 
collected no rent or other monies in connection with his duties regarding the Property. . . . Consequently, there is no rent to be paid to [Wilmington]"; 
7. On December 18, 2019, the circuit court entered 
the Order Confirming Foreclosure Sale that approved the 
Commissioner's report; confirmed the sale of the Property; and 
directed that the purchaser of the Property pay to the AOAO "a special assessment for monthly common assessments that were assessed to the Property during the six months immediately preceding the completion of the foreclosure" pursuant to HRS ยง 514B-146; 
8. On January 15, 2020, the AOAO filed a notice of 
appeal from the Order Confirming Foreclosure Sale and the relatedJudgment, resulting in the creation of CAAP-20-0000024; 
9. On May 14, 2020, the AOAO filed a motion to 
dismiss CAAP-20-0000024; 
10. On May 21, 2020, we entered an order granting the 
AOAO's motion to dismiss CAAP-20-0000024, whereupon the Order Confirming Foreclosure Sale and the Judgment became final and non-appealable; 
11. Mootness is an issue of subject matter 
jurisdiction.  Doe v. Doe, 120 Hawai# i 149, 164, 202 P.3d 610, 
625 (App. 2009); 
12. The Hawai# i Supreme Court has held: 
As a general rule, a case is moot if the reviewing court can
no longer grant effective relief.  Stated another way, thecentral question before us is whether changes in thecircumstances that prevailed at the beginning of litigationhave forestalled any occasion for meaningful relief. 
In Re Marn Family, 141 Hawai# i 1, 7, 403 P.3d 621, 627 (2016) 
(cleaned up) (citation omitted); 
13. When we perceive a jurisdictional defect in an 
appeal we must, sua sponte, dismiss that appeal.  Bennett v. 
Chung, 143 Hawai# i 266, 274, 428 P.3d 778, 786 (2018); and 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
14. None of the exceptions to the mootness doctrine 
apply: public interest, see Doe v. Doe, 116 Hawai# i 323, 327, 172 
P.3d 1067, 1071 (2007); "capable of repetition yet evading 
review," see State v. Tui, 138 Hawai# i 462, 468, 382 P.3d 274, 
280 (2016); or "collateral consequences," see Hamilton ex rel. Lethem v. Lethem, 119 Hawai# i 1, 7, 193 P.3d 839, 845 (2008). 
Now therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that these appeals 
are moot and are dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. 
Dated: Honolulu, Hawai# i, October 13, 2020.
