FEDERAL LAND BANK OF HAWAII (FLBH); FARM CREDIT SERVICES OF

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 18-1-0018K)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Chan, JJ.)
Plaintiffs-Appellants Morton E. Bassan, Jr. and Keiko
Bassan (Bassans), pro se , appeal  from the April 30, 20181
1The Bassans fail to comply with Hawai #i Rules of Appellate
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 3(c), as they have not designated "the judgment, order,
or part thereof and the court or agency appealed from" nor attached a copy of
the judgment or order.  Furthermore, the Bassans have also violated HRAP
Rule 12.1 in that they fail to provide record references for the "relevant
procedural facts establishing jurisdiction" in their Jurisdictional Statement,
thereby failing to clarify from what order or judgment they intend to appeal. 
HRAP Rule 12.1(c).
Furthermore, amongst other deficiencies in their opening brief,
the Bassans' "Concise Statement of Points of Error" violates HRAP
Rule 28(b)(4) as it fails to state "the alleged error committed by the court"
that has been appealed from in this appeal, and fails to provide record
citations for the alleged errors or where they were objected to or otherwise
brought to the court's attention, which would ordinarily cause the points to
be disregarded.  In addition, their argument section consists of bare
allegations unsupported by citations to the record or legal authority as
required by HRAP Rule 28(b)(7) and is unintelligible.

Judgment entered by the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit
(Circuit Court).2
The instant case arises out of a series of lawsuits
stemming from a foreclosure action brought by Defendant-Appellee
Federal Land Bank of Hawaii (Federal Land Bank) in 2005 (2005
Foreclosure) on a 1999 note and mortgage.  On February 15, 2011,
the Circuit Court  granted summary judgment and a decree of
foreclosure (2011 Foreclosure Judgment) in favor of Federal Land
Bank and against the Bassans and their business entities.   The
Bassans did not appeal the Judgment.  On February 23, 2012, the
sale of the mortgaged property to Federal Land Bank through a
credit bid was confirmed by the entry of the "Order Granting
[Federal Land Bank's] Motion for Confirmation of Sale, for
Allowance of Additional Amounts, for Distribution of Proceeds,
for Order Directing Conveyance, Assignment, and Transfer, and for
Writ of Possession, Judgment for Possession, and Execution"
(February 23, 2012 Order).  The Bassans did not appeal the
February 23, 2012 Order.43
1(...continued)
Nevertheless, as "[a]n appeal shall not be dismissed for
informality of form or title of the notice of appeal," HRAP Rule 3(c)(2), and
this court has maintained a policy of addressing parties' appeals on the
merits, where possible, O'Connor v. Diocese of Honolulu, 77 Hawai #i 383, 386,
885 P.2d 361, 364 (1994), we have endeavored to ascertain the nature of their
arguments.  We note a Judgment was entered by the Circuit Court within thirty
days of the filing of the Bassans' notice of appeal; we presume it is from
this judgment that this appeal has been taken.  Reading the judgment in
conjunction with the remedies sought in their complaint and prayer for relief
in their opening brief includes a remand, we construe the Bassans' appeal as
an attempt to continue their attack on the 2005 Foreclosure action.
2The Honorable Robert D.S. Kim presided.
3The Honorable Glenn S. Hara presided.
4Pending the Circuit Court's 2011 Foreclosure Judgment, the Bassans
filed two Chapter 12 bankruptcy actions in the United States Bankruptcy Court,
District of Hawaii: Case No. 08-00531, which was dismissed; and Case No. 11-
01906, in which Federal Land Bank obtained relief from an automatic stay,
allowing the 2005 Foreclosure to proceed.  The 2011 bankruptcy was converted
to a Chapter 7 proceeding.  Pursuant to an approved Release and Settlement
Agreement, the Bankruptcy Trustee released and discharged Federal Land Bank
from any and all of the Bassans' pre-petition claims and causes of action.

The present appeal is from the dismissal of the
Bassans' 2018 lawsuit against the Federal Land Bank, Farm Credit
Services of Hawaii, Hawaii Production Credit Association
(collectively the Farm Lenders), and the Directors of Hawai#i's
Departments of Taxation (DOT) and Commerce and Consumer Affairs
(DCCA), seeking invalidation of the 2011 Foreclosure Judgment and
February 23, 2012 Order under Hawai#i Rules of Civil Procedure
(HRCP) Rule 60(b) based on Federal Land Bank's alleged non-
compliance with "454M-2.5"  and HRS § 434-34.6 5
The Bassans argue on appeal that the Farm Lenders have
committed fraud upon the court as (1) Farm Lenders are
unregistered and unlicensed to do business in Hawai #i, and, thus,
have evaded paying taxes and regulatory fees and committed
unlawful foreclosures to boost income; (2) the DCCA and DOT do
not defend their failure to enforce registration and tax laws;
5Presumably, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 454M-2.5 (2013),
effective on May 5, 2011, which provides:
Unlicensed foreclosure actions voided.   Any action
taken in connection with a mortgage foreclosure under
chapter 667 by a nonexempt person who engages in the
business of mortgage servicing without a license as provided
in this chapter shall be void for purposes of chapter 667. 
The Bassans' prayer for relief with regard to HRS § 454M-2.5
reads, 
Per 454M-2.5 unlicensed foreclosure actions voided; because
[Federal Land Bank] was not properly registered or licensed
then on February 23rd 2012 "ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF'S
MOTION FOR CONFIRMATION OF SALE, FOR ALLOWANCE OF ADDITIONAL
AMOUNTS, FOR DISTRIBUTION OF PROCEEDS, FOR ORDER DIRECTING
CONVEYANCE, ASSIGNMENT AND TRANSFER, AND FOR WRIT OF
POSSESSION, JUDGMENT FOR POSSESSION, AND EXECUTION," File
stamped February 23, 2012 is voided.
6Chapter 434, Insurance By Fraternal Benefit Societies, was
repealed in 1987, approximately twelve years before the note and mortgage
involved in this case.  1987 Haw. Sess. Laws Vol. 2 Act 347, § 1 at 1. 
Therefore, we do not address the applicability of this statute further.
The Bassans also asked, if relief was granted on either ground,
that the case be designated as complex litigation under Hawai #i Circuit Court
Rule 12(k).
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
and (3) hearing transcripts from Civil No. 15-1-416K  were
tampered with because they omitted statements made in open court,
such as Mr. Bassan saying that Federal Land Bank is neither
registered nor licensed to conduct business in Hawai# i and the
court stating that the Bassans are not vexatious litigants.  They
pray that this court "vacate and remand this case back to lower
court for [Federal Land Bank's] registration, licensing, or
certification with or without tax evasion issues to be heard and
consequences of operating an unregistered, unlicensed, or
uncertified business with or without tax evasion."7
"Res judicata . . . limit[s] a litigant to one
opportunity to litigate aspects of the case to prevent
inconsistent results and multiplicity of suits and to
promote finality and judicial economy."  E. Sav. Bank, FSB
v. Esteban, 129 Hawai #i 154, 158, 296 P.3d 1062, 1066 (2013)
(citing Dorrance v. Lee, 90 Hawai #i 143, 148-49, 976 P.2d
904, 909-10 (1999)).  The doctrine prohibits parties from
"relitigating a previously adjudicated cause of action."

CAAP-17-0000835, 2019 WL 3824200, at *3 (App. Aug. 15 2019)
(SDO).  
Here, the Bassans seek to invalidate the 2011
Foreclosure Judgment and February 23, 2012 Order entered in the
2005 Foreclosure.  The Bassans, as named defendants, participated
in that foreclosure action and appealed from neither, resulting
in both judgment and order becoming final.  In the present
action, they essentially seek to reopen and/or invalidate these
7On December 21, 2015, the Bassans filed a complaint in Civil
No. 15-1-416K against directors and officers of Federal Land Bank, its past
and present counsel, Farm Credit Services, third-party purchasers of the
property, process servers, and the Farm Credit Administration making
allegations against Federal Land Bank under HRS chapter 454M.  In addition,
the complaint contained 200 counts of civil conspiracy and "anti-Semitic civil
conspiracy," without including any factual allegations.
The Circuit Court, the Honorable Ronald Ibarra presiding, ruled
that HRS § 454M-2.5 did not apply, the Bassans' complaint did not state a
claim under the Farm Credit Act, and dismissed all claims against all parties
with prejudice and entered judgment against the Bassans.
This court dismissed the appeal from the judgment as untimely and
the Hawai #i Supreme Court denied the Bassans' petition for certiorari.

judgments based on alleged violation of state regulatory
statutes.
We have held in a number of cases that, once the
judgment of foreclosure becomes final, the doctrine of res
judicata prevents foreclosure defendants from raising defenses
that could have been pursued in challenging the entry of
foreclosure.  See Ventures Tr. 2013-I-H-R by MCM Capital
Partners, LLC v. Laurin, 144 Hawai#i 432, 443 P.3d 124, CAAP-17-
0000849 and CAAP-18-0000032, 2019 WL 2609134, at *1 (App.
Jun. 26, 2019) (SDO) (relying on Mortg. Elec. Registration Sys.
Inc. v. Wise, 130 Hawai#i 11, 17, 304 P.3d 1192, 1198 (2013),
failure to appeal foreclosure judgment precluded challenge to
plaintiff-lender's standing and could not resurrect argument
under HRCP Rule 60(b)(4)); Nationstar Mortg. LLC v. Boonstra, 144
Hawai#i 393, 442 P.3d 456, CAAP-18-0000583, 2019 WL 2441427, at
*1 (App. Jun. 12, 2019) (SDO) (relying on Wise, failure to appeal
from foreclosure judgment prevented challenge of same based on
standing of plaintiff-lender); HSBC Bank USA v. Rojas Reyes, 138
Hawai#i 142, 377 P.3d 1060, CAAP-13-0006151, 2016 WL 4089030, at
*1 (App. Jul. 27, 2016) (SDO) (failure to appeal foreclosure
judgment precluded claims of fraud and breach of fiduciary duty,
relying on Esteban, 129 Hawai# i at 160, 296 P.3d at 1068, which
barred federal truth in lending claims where the foreclosure
judgment was not appealed).
We are aware that the Hawaii Production Credit
Association, and the Directors of the DOT and DCCA were not
parties to Farm Land Bank's 2005 Foreclosure.  However, Hawai#i
"ha[s] partially abandoned the traditional requirement of
identity of parties" in the application of collateral estoppel,
which "precludes relitigation of facts or issues previously
determined when it is raised defensively by one not a party in a
prior suit against one who was a party in that suit and who
himself raised and litigated the fact or issue."  Santos v. State
Dep't of Transp., Kauai Div., 64 Haw. 648, 652, 646 P.2d 962, 965
(1982) (citations omitted).  In Civ. No. 15-1-0416K the Bassans
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
argued HRS ch. 454M as a basis to void the "mortgage
foreclosure's commissioners deed filed April 20, 2012 . . . and,
if any, all other related documents."  The Circuit Court rejected
the Bassans' argument, and their appeal from this decision was
dismissed as untimely and rejected on certiorari by the Hawai#i
Supreme Court.  Thus, the Bassans are precluded by collateral
estoppel from asserting this claim against Hawaii Production
Credit Association, and the Directors of the DOT and DCCA in this
appeal.
Therefore, the April 30, 2018 Judgment entered by the
Circuit Court of the Third Circuit is affirmed.
