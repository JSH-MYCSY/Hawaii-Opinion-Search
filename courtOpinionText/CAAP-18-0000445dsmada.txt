STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
MASON BECK, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 3CPC-17-0000226) 
ORDER FOR SANCTIONS AND ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL 
(By:  Reifurth, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of Robert Isaac Curtis's (Curtis) 
June 3, 2019 response to the May 22, 2019 order to show cause, 
the papers in support, and the record in case numbers CAAP-18-
0000445 and CAAP-18-0000582, it appears that: 
(1) Curtis's response is not in the form of a 
declaration complying with Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
(HRAP) Rule 52, affidavit or other sworn statement as required by the order to show cause; 
(2) Curtis failed to demonstrate good cause concerning 
his failure to file the statement of jurisdiction and opening 
brief, or request an extension of time; NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(3) On May 28, 2018, Defendant-Appellant Mason Beck 
(Beck) filed, through Curtis, the notice of appeal from the 
mittimus entered in the underlying case, No. 3CPC-17-0000226, on 
May 23, 2018, which created case number CAAP-18-0000445; 
(4) On July 20, 2018, Beck filed, through Curtis, the 
notice of appeal from the amended judgment entered in the 
underlying case on June 22, 2018, which created case number CAAP-
18-0000582; 
(5) The appeals in case numbers CAAP-18-0000445 and 
CAAP-18-0000582 are redundant, as they involve the same parties, 
underlying case, facts, record, and reviewable issues; and 
(6) On April 17, 2019, following a temporary remand by 
the court in case number CAAP-18-0000582, the circuit court in 
the underlying case entered a so-called "first amended order" 
granting Jeremy J.K. Butterfield's (Butterfield) March 20, 2019 
motion to amend the order granting Curtis's August 8, 2018 motion 
to withdraw as counsel.  The circuit court withdrew Curtis and 
appointed Brian J. De Lima and Butterfield as counsel for Beck. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: (1) Pursuant to HRAP Rule 51, Robert Isaac Curtis is 
sanctioned in the amount of $50.00. 
(2) A check in the full amount, payable to the State 
Director of Finance, along with a copy of this order, shall be deposited with the Supreme Court Clerk's Office within ten days 
from the date of this order. 
(3) A declaration of Counsel attesting to the payment 
shall be filed within ten days from the date of this order. 
(4) The sanction shall be paid by Counsel personally 
and without reimbursement. 
(5) Failure to comply with this order may result in 
additional sanctions. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the appellate clerk shall 
add Brian J. De Lima and Jeremy J.K. Butterfield as counsel for 
Beck in case number CAAP-18-0000445.
