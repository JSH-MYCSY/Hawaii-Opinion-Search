v. 
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Respondent-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(S.P.P. NO. 16-1-0016) 
MEMORANDUM OPINION 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
The Circuit Court of the First Circuit1 denied the 
Hawai# i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40 petition filed by 
self-represented Petitioner-Appellant Tuipuapua E. Moananu 
(Moananu
) without a hearing. Moananu appeals from the "Findings 
of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying Petition for Post-Conviction Relief and Amendment Without a Hearing" (Order) 
entered on April 25, 2018. For the reasons explained below, we 
vacate the Order in part and remand for a hearing to resolve an ambiguity concerning Moananu's mandatory minimum sentences and, if necessary, for resentencing. 
BACKGROUND 
On April 23, 1984, Moananu was convicted of burglary in 
the first degree for entering into the residence of another person and taking a television and stereo. JIMS 1PC000059702. He was sentenced to 5 years probation.

On May 17, 1990, Moananu was convicted of theft in the 
second degree, unauthorized control of propelled vehicle, and 
assault in the third degree, for using a firearm to take the purse of another person. JIMS 1PC890000501. He was sentenced to 5 years in prison, and was eventually granted parole.

On December 23, 1998, Moananu was convicted of burglary 
in the first degree
2 and impersonating a law enforcement officer 
in the second degree for entering the residence of another person by identifying himself as an FBI agent, while armed with a fire-arm, and taking jewelry from the residence. JIMS 1PC970002144. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison with a mandatory minimum of 3 years and 4 months as a repeat felony offender, and 1 year in prison for impersonating a law enforcement officer. 
Also on December 23, 1998, in a separate case, Moananu 
was convicted of robbery in the second degree
3 and burglary in 
the first degree4 for entering the residence of another person 
and taking the person's cash and food stamps while armed with a firearm. JIMS 1PC980000772. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison with a mandatory minimum of 3 years and 4 months as a repeat offender. 
PROCEDURAL HISTORY

was indicted by a grand jury for robbery in the first degree 
(counts 1 and 2) and one count of impersonating a law enforcement
officer in the first degree  (count 4).  On July 8, 2010, a jury 
found him guilty as charged. 7 65
 
Sentencing 
On August 10, 2010, the State filed three sentencing
motions: (1) motion for sentencing of repeat offender; 8 
5 Robbery in the first degree is a class A felony. HRS § 708-840(3)
(1993) 
6 Impersonating a law enforcement officer in the first degree is a
class C Felony. HRS § 710-1016.6(2) (1993). 
7 Count 3, for robbery in the first degree involving a third person,
was stricken from the indictment. 
8 HRS § 706-606.5 (1993 & Supp. 2010) provided, in relevant part: 
Sentencing of repeat offenders . (1) Notwithstanding section
706-669 and any other law to the contrary, any person
convicted of murder in the second degree, any class Afelony, any class B felony, or any of the following class Cfelonies: . . . 707–716 relating to terroristic threateningin the first degree; . . . 134–8 relating to ownership,etc., of prohibited weapons; . . . shall be sentenced to amandatory minimum period of imprisonment without possibilityof parole during such period as follows:

(continued...)

8 (2) motion for consecutive term sentencing; and (3) motion for 
mandatory term of imprisonment for use of a firearm in a felony .
The motions were heard on November 15, 2010.  After explaining 
its analysis of the Hawaii Revised Statute (HRS) § 706-606 
factors, the circuit court stated: 109 
Therefore, considering the retributive and deterrent
goals, the Court imposes and grants in part the consecutive
term sentencing. Count I and Count II will be consecutive. Count IV will be concurrent. 
The Court finds that the defendant's continued use of 
firearms to commit crimes, the defendant's previoussentences, and the defendant's inability to conform hisconduct to the requirements of the law, a consecutive termof imprisonment, at least in Counts I and II, is necessaryin order to address the seriousness of the crimes committed by the defendant. 
(...continued)
. . . . 
(5) The sentencing court may impose the above
sentences consecutive to any sentence imposed on the
defendant for a prior conviction, but such sentence shall beimposed concurrent to the sentence imposed for the instantconviction. . . . 
. . . . 
(7) For purposes of this section: 
(a) Convictions under two or more counts of an indictment or complaint shall be considered asingle conviction without regard to when theconvictions occur[.] 
9 HRS § 706-660.1 (1993), which has not been amended since State v.
Cornelio, 84 Hawai #i 476, 935 P.2d 1021 (1997) was decided, states, in
relevant part: 
(1) A person convicted of a felony, where the person had a
firearm in the person's possession or threatened its use orused the firearm while engaged in the commission of thefelony, whether the firearm was loaded or not, and whetheroperable or not, may in addition to the indeterminate termof imprisonment provided for the grade of offense besentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonmentwithout possibility of parole or probation the length ofwhich shall be as follows: 
. . . . 
(b) For a class A felony — up to ten years[.] 
10 The record on appeal does not contain a transcript of the
sentencing hearing but we have taken judicial notice of the Transcript ofProceedings on November 15, 2010, filed in Moananu's direct appeal,CAAP-11-0000152, pursuant to Rule 201 of the Hawaii Rules of Evidence. 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Court further finds and concludes that the 
consecutive term of imprisonment as to Counts I and II is
warranted due to the defendant's continued violation in disregard of the terms and conditions of parole, and toprevent future criminal conduct of the defendant itsdeterrent goal, therefore, Mr. Moananu, Counts I and II, theterms of imprisonment will be run consecutive. Count IV, theterm of imprisonment will run concurrent. So the Court grants in part and denies in part the State's motion forconsecutive sentencing. 
On November 17, 2010, the circuit court entered 
findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an order granting in 
part and denying in part the State's motion for consecutive termsof imprisonment  (Consecutive Term Order). The Consecutive Term 
Order stated, in pertinent part: 11 
8. Therefore, based on the Defendant's dangerous
behavior and continued disregard for the law, the court
hereby sentences the Defendant to a term of imprisonment oftwenty (20) years in Count I [robbery] and a term ofimprisonment of twenty (20) years in Count II [robbery] andfive (5) years in Count IV [impersonating a police officer]in Cr. No. 07-1-2129. 
9. The court sentences the Defendant to the 
mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of thirteen (13)years and four (4) months in Counts I and II and three (3)years and four (4) months in Count IV in Cr. No. 07-1-2129,as a repeat offender pursuant to H.R.S. § 706-605.5. 
10. The court further sentences the Defendant to the 
mandatory minimum term of ten (10) years imprisonment inCounts I and II in Cr. No. 07-1-2129, as a result of hispossession or use of a firearm in the commission of a crimepursuant to H.R.S. § 706-660.1. 
11. The terms of imprisonment imposed by the court
in Counts I and II in Cr. No. 07-1-2129 are to run consecutively to each other . The term of imprisonment
imposed by the court in Count IV in Cr. No. 07-1-2129 is torun concurrent to Counts I and II. 
(Emphasis added.) 
On February 16, 2011, the circuit court entered an
order granting the State's motion for sentencing of repeat 
offender (Repeat Offender Order). The Repeat Offender Order
stated, in relevant part:  
 
[T]he Court having found that Defendant is a repeat offender
pursuant to Section 706-606.5 of the Hawaii Revised 
11 The Honorable Randal K.O. Lee presided. 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Statutes, . . . Defendant is sentenced to a reduced [12]
mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of thirteen (13)
years and four (4) months as to Count I, thirteen (13) yearsand four (4) months as to Count II, and three (3) years andfour (4) months as to Count IV. 
(Footnote added.) (Paragraph structure altered.) 
On February 17, 2011, the circuit court entered an 
order granting the State's motion for mandatory term of 
imprisonment for use of a firearm in a felony (Firearm Felony
Order). The Firearm Felony Order stated, in relevant part: 
[P]ursuant to Section 706-660.1(b) [sic] of the Hawaii
Revised Statutes, based on Defendant's conviction for theoffenses of Counts I--II: Robbery in the First Degree (ClassA felonies). 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the aforesaid motion be and
the same is hereby granted, and Defendant is sentenced to amandatory term of imprisonment of ten (10) years as toCounts I and II.  
On February 16, 2011, the circuit court entered its 
"Amended Judgment of Conviction and Sentence" (Amended Judgment).
The Amended Judgment stated, in relevant part:  
(NUNC PRO TUNC TO NOVEMBER 15, 2010)
DEFENDANT IS COMMITTED TO THE CUSTODY OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY TO SERVE A TERM OF IMPRISONMENT OF TWENTY (20) YEARS EACH IN COUNTS 1 AND 2, TO RUN 
CONSECUTIVE WITH EACH OTHER , WITH A MANDATORY MINIMUM TERM
OF IMPRISONMENT OF TEN (10) YEARS IN COUNTS 1 AND 2,PURSUANT TO SECTION 706-660.1(b) [sic] AND THIRTEEN (13)YEARS AND FOUR (4) MONTHS IN COUNTS 1 AND 2 AS A REPEATOFFENDER, PURSUANT TO SECTION 706-606.5(1)(b) [sic]. AS TO COUNT 4, SERVE A TERM OF IMPRISONMENT OF FIVE (5) YEARS WITHA MANDATORY MINIMUM TERM OF IMPRISONMENT OF THREE (3) YEARSAND FOUR (4) MONTHS, AS A REPEAT OFFENDER, PURSUANT TOSECTION 706-606.5(1)(b) [sic], TO RUN CONCURRENT WITH COUNTS1 AND 2. DEFENDANT TO BE GIVEN CREDIT FOR TIME ALREADY SERVED. MITTIMUS FORTHWITH. ALL FEES WAIVED. 
Direct Appeal 
Moananu appealed his conviction and sentence, making 
three arguments: (1) the circuit court erred by admitting 
evidence of his prior bad acts; (2) the circuit court abused itsdiscretion by denying his motion to continue his sentencing hearing; and (3) the circuit court abused its discretion by  
12 The State had requested mandatory minimums of 20 years for counts
1 and 2, and 5 years on count 4. 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
imposing consecutive sentences to punish him for exercising his 
right to a jury trial. We affirmed; on the latter issue we held: 
[I]t is clear that the circuit court had ample grounds upon
which to base its sentence. The circuit court's stated reasons, both at sentencing and in its written decision anduncontested on appeal, included the seriousness of theinstant offenses, Moananu's extensive criminal history thatdemonstrated repeated acts of theft from others usingfirearms, his violations of parole while under threat ofmaximum sentences, and the physicians' determination that hewas malingering after the circuit court allowed acontinuance of the proceedings because he decided to assertthat he suffered from a physical or mental disease, disorderor defect excluding penal responsibility. 
There was no evidence that the circuit court 
considered Moananu's exercise of his right to a jury trialor refused to consider Moananu's cooperation [with lawenforcement in another case] in imposing sentence. 
State v. Moananu, Nos. CAAP–11–0000152, CAAP–11–0000593, 2012 WL 
5381247, at *3 (Haw. App. Nov. 2, 2012) (SDO). It does not appear that Moananu petitioned for certiorari. 
HRPP Rule 40 Petition 
On June 22, 2016, Moananu filed the HRPP Rule 40 
petition that gave rise to this appeal. He filed an "Amendment" 
on September 29, 2016, that was actually a supplement. Collectively, he presented the following grounds for relief: 
(1) he was sentenced twice for the same offense 
in counts 1 and 2, in violation of double
jeopardy; 
(2) his maximum sentence of 40 years is illegal
because it was imposed without the "state-
ment" required by HRS § 706-668.5; 
(3) his mandatory minimum sentence of "46-years8-months" is illegal because it exceeds his
40 year maximum sentence; 
(4) his sentence of 13 years and 4 months oncount 1 is illegal because it violates HRS
§ 706-660; and 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(5) the trial judge failed to properly instruct
the jury on the elements of the charged
offenses, elements of the claimed defenses,repeat offender sentencing under HRS § 706-606.5, and multiple sentences of imprisonmentunder HRS § 706-668.5. 
(Emphasis added.) 
The circuit court entered the Order on April 25, 2018. 
The circuit court concluded that grounds (1) and (5) were waived,
and that Moananu failed to prove the existence of extraordinary circumstances to justify his failure to raise those issues duringhis trial or his direct appeal. The circuit court also concludedthat grounds (2), (3), and (4) had been ruled upon during the evidentiary hearing on the State's motions for consecutive terms of imprisonment, sentencing of repeat offender, and mandatory terms of imprisonment on November 15, 2010. The circuit court denied the petition without a hearing. This appeal followed.  
 
 
STANDARD OF REVIEW 
A circuit court's denial of a Rule 40 petition without
a hearing is reviewed de novo; we step into the circuit court's position, review the same trial record, and redecide the issue, determining whether the circuit court's decision was right or wrong. Hutch v. State, 107 Hawai# i 411, 414, 114 P.3d 917, 920 
(2005). 
HRPP Rule 40(f) provides, in relevant part:  
[T]he court may deny a hearing if the petitioner's claim is
patently frivolous and is without trace of support either inthe record or from other evidence submitted by thepetitioner. The court may also deny a hearing on a specificquestion of fact when a full and fair evidentiary hearingupon that question was held during the course of theproceedings which led to the judgment or custody which isthe subject of the petition or at any later proceeding. 
HRPP Rule 40(g)(2) similarly provides, in relevant part: 
The court may dismiss a petition at any time upon findingthe petition is patently frivolous, the issues have beenpreviously raised and ruled upon, or the issues were waived.The court may deny a petition upon determining theallegations and arguments have no merit. 
Where, as here, the circuit court denies a Rule 40 petition with-
out a hearing, the question on appeal is whether the trial record 
8                      
              NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
indicates that the petition made such a showing of a colorable 
claim as to require a hearing before the circuit court. Hutch, 
107 Hawai# i at 414, 114 P.3d at 920. 
DISCUSSION 
Moananu presents three arguments on appeal. We discuss 
them in the order raised by Moananu. 
Moananu was given reasonable notice of the
State's intention to seek mandatory minimum
terms of imprisonment. 
On appeal, Moananu first argues that he was not given 
reasonable notice of the State's intention to seek application of 
the mandatory minimum statute for use of a firearm in a felony, HRS § 706-660.1. This argument was not made in his Rule 40 petition. HRPP Rule 40(c)(1) provides, in relevant part: 
The petition shall specify all the grounds for relief which
are available to the petitioner and of which the petitionerhas or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should haveknowledge and shall set forth in summary form the factssupporting each of the grounds thus specified. 
Because Moananu raised the issue of notice for the first time on 
appeal, we need not consider his contention. Dan v. State, 76 
Hawai# i 423, 431, 879 P.2d 528, 536 (1994). We note the record 
clearly shows that Moananu was given reasonable notice of the State's intent to seek a mandatory minimum sentence when the State filed its sentencing motions on August 10, 2010,
13 more 
than three months before the motions were heard on November 15, 2010. 
Ground (3) was not previously ruled upon and,
in any event, cannot be waived. 
"Ground Three" of Moananu's Rule 40 petition claimed: 
"Illegal Sentence: Petitioner was sentenced to a maximum term of 
13 The certificates of service appended to each of the motions
indicate that Moananu's defense counsel was served with the motions on 
August 5, 2010. 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
40-years. Petitioner's Mandatory Minimum total to 46-years 8-
months. Thereby exceeding the 40-years maximum." The circuit court found 
that a full and fair evidentiary hearing was held on this
issue on November 15, 2010, which addressed the State'sMotion for Consecutive Terms of Imprisonment, the State'sMotion for Sentencing of Repeat Offender, and the State'sMotion for Mandatory Terms of Imprisonment. For this reason, this Court dismisses Ground Three  without a hearing
as having been previously ruled upon. 
The transcript of the November 15, 2010 hearing does not indicate 
that the issue raised by Ground Three was previously raised14 or 
previously ruled upon. Accordingly, the first issue presented by this appeal is whether Ground Three of Moananu's Rule 40 petition "made such a showing of a colorable claim as to require a hearing before the [circuit] court." Hutch, 107 Hawai# i at 414, 114 P.3d 
at 920 (emphasis and citations omitted). 
The Repeat Offender Order stated that Moananu would be 
sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of 13 years, 4 months as to Count I, 13 years, 4 months as to Count II, and 3 years, 4 months as to Count IV. The Firearm Felony Order stated that Moananu would be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of 10 years as to Counts I and II. The Consecutive Term Order stated that Moananu would be sentenced to mandatory minimum terms of 13 years, 4 months in Counts I and II as a repeat offender and 10 years in Counts I and II for use of a firearm in a felony, to run consecutively. The Amended Judgment stated, in relevant part: 
DEFENDANT IS COMMITTED TO THE CUSTODY OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE 
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY TO SERVE A TERM OF IMPRISONMENT OF TWENTY (20) YEARS EACH IN COUNTS 1 AND 2, TO RUN 
CONSECUTIVE WITH EACH OTHER , WITH A MANDATORY MINIMUM TERM
OF IMPRISONMENT OF TEN (10) YEARS IN COUNTS 1 AND 2,PURSUANT TO SECTION 706-660.1(b) [sic] AND THIRTEEN (13)YEARS AND FOUR (4) MONTHS IN COUNTS 1 AND 2 AS A REPEATOFFENDER, PURSUANT TO SECTION 706-606.5(1)(b) [sic]. 
The wording of the various orders and the Amended Judgment do not 
precisely track each other. That appears to be the reason for Moananu's concern that the circuit court imposed mandatory 
14 A claim of illegal sentence cannot be waived. See HRPP 
Rule 40(a)(3) ("Except for a claim of illegal sentence, an issue is waived if
the petitioner knowingly and understandably failed to raise it[.]"). 
10 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
minimum sentences totaling 23 years, 4 months for Count I, and 
another 23 years, 4 months for Count II, to be served consecutively for a total of 46 years, 8 months. 
In support of his Rule 40 petition Moananu submitted a 
copy of a letter from the Hawai# i Paroling Authority (HPA) dated 
March 15, 2016, which stated, in relevant part: 
[T]he court ordered you serve your 20-year maximum terms
under Counts 1 and 2 consecutive to one another, and alsoordered that you serve a mandatory minimum term of 13 yearsand 4 months under each consecutive  term. Based on the 
court's order that you serve your terms under Counts 1 and 2consecutively, you also automatically serve your courtimposed mandatory minimum terms consecutively unless thecourt specifically states otherwise in the Judgment, whichit did not. Therefore, the court set a total mandatory
minimum term of 26 years and 8 months , not the HPA. 
The HPA apparently interpreted the Amended Judgment to impose two 
consecutive 13-year, 4-month repeat offender mandatory minimums. Such a sentence would be illegal. State v. Cornelio, 84 Hawai# i 
476, 494, 935 P.2d 1021, 1039 (1997) ("HRS § 706–606.5 divests a sentencing court of the authority to impose consecutive [repeat offender] mandatory minimum periods of imprisonment on a defendant convicted of multiple felony counts charged in the same indictment[.]"). 
However, it would not have been illegal for the 
circuit court to impose consecutive 10-year minimum terms for use of a firearm in a felony. Id. at 487-88, 935 P.2d at 1032-33 
(discussing 
State v. Kumukau, 71 Haw. 218, 222-24, 226, 787 P.2d 
682, 685-87[, 689] (1990)). Nor would it have been illegal for the circuit court to impose a mandatory minimum 13-year, 4-month repeat offender term consecutive to a mandatory minimum 10-year term for use of a firearm during commission of a felony. Id. at 
488, 935 P.2d at 1033 (holding that "a sentencing court may order that a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment imposed under HRS § 706–660.1 be served consecutively to a mandatory period of imprisonment imposed under HRS § 706–606.5 in connection with a separate felony conviction arising out of a charge contained in the same indictment or complaint."). 
Because the circuit court's sentencing intent was 
ambiguous, we hold that Ground Three states a colorable claim of illegal sentence, and should not have been denied without a 
11 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
hearing. We remand this case for the circuit court to conduct a 
hearing to determine its mandatory minimum sentencing intent. If it is impracticable for the circuit court to make such a determination,
15 Moananu should be resentenced. 
It was not necessary for Moananu's grand jury
indictment to allege his prior convictionsfor the State to seek repeat offender
mandatory minimum sentencing.                 
Moananu's third argument on appeal is that the State, 
when seeking to sentence a defendant to a mandatory minimum 
sentence as a repeat offender under HRS § 706-606.5, must include the defendant's predicate prior convictions in the charging instrument. Moananu correctly cites State v. Auld, 136 Hawai# i 
244, 361 P.3d 471 (2015), for the proposition that under article I, sections 5 and 10 of the Hawai
#i Constitution, a 
defendant's predicate prior convictions must be alleged in the charging instrument when the State seeks repeat offender sentencing under HRS § 706-606.5. However, because the Hawai# i 
Supreme Court announced a new rule in Auld, its holding was to take prospective effect only. Id.
 at 256-57, 361 P.3d at 483-84. 
Auld was decided on November 24, 2015; Moananu's indictment was issued on November 15, 2007, and the Amended Judgment was entered on February 16, 2011, before Auld was decided. Auld does not 
apply to this case. 
Moananu waived appellate review of grounds
(1), (2), (4), and (5) of his Rule 40
petition.                                  
Moananu's briefs make no discernable argument that the 
circuit court erred by ruling that his arguments (1) and (5) were 
waived, or that his arguments (2) and (4) had previously been ruled upon by the trial court. We disregard those contentions. State v. Mark, 123 Hawai# i 205, 247, 231 P.3d 478, 520 (2010). 
15 The judge who originally sentenced Moananu is no longer a circuit
court judge. 
12 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
CONCLUSION 
Based upon the foregoing, the "Findings of Fact, Con-
clusions of Law, and Order Denying Petition for Post-Conviction 
Relief and Amendment Without a Hearing" entered by the circuit court on April 25, 2018, is vacated in part, to the extent that Moananu's HRPP Rule 40 petition was denied without a hearing as to Ground Three only. On remand, the circuit court should conduct a hearing to determine its sentencing intent or, if it is impracticable for the circuit court to make such a determination, for resentencing.
