under Hawai#i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 43(a), for
self-represented Appellant-Appellant Lanric Hyland (Hyland); 
(2) On June 2, 2021, the court ordered that within
thirty days from the order, DHS shall confirm whether a special
administrator or personal representative has been appointed for
Hyland's estate and, if so, DHS shall take further action
specified in the order; and
(3) On June 24, 2021, DHS's counsel filed a declaration
stating there is no record of a personal representative, special
administrator, or other person with designated authority over
Hyland's public assistance benefits; DHS's counsel and Hawai#i
State Judiciary staff reviewed court records and determined there
is no probate case or other action appointing a personal
representative or special administrator for Hyland's estate;

there being no substitute appellant in this case.
