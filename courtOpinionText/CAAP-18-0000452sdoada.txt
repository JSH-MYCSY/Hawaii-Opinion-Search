APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

(Circuit Court).1 After a jury trial, Taupau was convicted of

1 The Honorable Christine E. Kuriyama presided. 
2 HRS § 708-836 provides: 
§ 708-836 Unauthorized control of propelled vehicle.

Taupau raises a single point of error on appeal, 
contending that the Circuit Court plainly erred in failing to 
instruct the jury on the agent affirmative defense available under HRS § 708-836(3)(a). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced, the issues raised by the parties, and the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Taupau's point of error as follows: 
"[A] defendant is entitled to an instruction on every 
defense or theory of defense having any support in the evidence, provided such evidence would support the consideration of that issue by the jury, no matter how weak, inconclusive, or unsatisfactory the evidence may be." State v. Hironaka, 99 
2(...continued)
(2) "Propelled vehicle" means an automobile,
airplane, motorcycle, motorboat, or other motor-propelled
vehicle. 
(3) It is an affirmative defense to a prosecution
under this section that the defendant: 
(a) Received authorization to use the vehicle from an agent of the owner where the agent had actualor apparent authority to authorize such use; or 
(b) Is a lien holder or legal owner of the propelledvehicle, or an authorized agent of the lienholder or legal owner, engaged in the lawfulrepossession of the propelled vehicle. 
(4) For the purposes of this section, "owner" means
the registered owner of the propelled vehicle or theunrecorded owner of the vehicle pending transfer ofownership; provided that if there is no registered owner ofthe propelled vehicle or unrecorded owner of the vehiclepending transfer of ownership, "owner" means the legalowner. 
(5) Unauthorized control of a propelled vehicle is a
class C felony.

Hawai# i 198, 204, 53 P.3d 806, 812 (2002) (citation and internal 
quotation marks omitted). 
Here, there was no rational basis in the evidence for 
the Circuit Court to give such an instruction. Taupau did not 
adduce any evidence that the person he identified as Maka – who he knew was not the owner of the subject vehicle, and who had thrown him the subject vehicle's keys upon his request to borrow it – was the agent of the owner of the subject vehicle. Accordingly, we conclude that the Circuit Court did not plainly err in failing to instruct the jury on the agent affirmative defense available under HRS § 708-836(3)(a). See State v. Palisbo, 93 
Hawai# i 344, 355, 3 P.3d 510, 521 (App. 2000); cf. 
State v. Mainaaupo, 117 Hawai# i 235, 248-49, 178 P.3d 1, 14-15 
(2008) (distinguishing Palisbo on the facts). 
Therefore, the Circuit Court's May 1, 2018 Judgment is 
affirmed.
