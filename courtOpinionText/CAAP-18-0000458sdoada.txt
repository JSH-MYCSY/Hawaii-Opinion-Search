IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAIʻI 
BANK OF AMERICA, N.A. AS SUCCESSOR BY MERGER TO LASALLE BANK 
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, AS TRUSTEE FOR CERTIFICATEHOLDERS OF BEAR 
STEARNS ASSET BACKED SECURITIES I LLC, ASSET-BACKED 
CERTIFICATES, SERIES 2007-HE5, Plaintiff-Appellee, v. 
PAUL LAWRENCE COLLINS, Defendant-Appellant. 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 1CC17-1-001443) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and McCullen, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Paul Lawrence Collins (
Collins) 
appeals from the Circuit Court of the First Circuit's1 May 9, 
2018 "Order Granting Plaintiff Bank of America, N.A., As 
Successor By Merger To LaSalle Bank National Association, As 
Trustee For Certificateholders Of Bear Stearns Asset Backed 
1 The Honorable Bert I. Ayabe presided.    
 
 
   
 
  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Securities I LLC, Asset-Backed Certificates, Series 2007-HE5's 
[(Bank of America)] Motion For Summary Judgment Filed March 9, 
2018" (Order Granting Summary Judgment) and May 21, 2018 Final 
Judgment. 
On appeal, Collins raises three points of error, and 
requests that the case be remanded based in part on Wells Fargo 
Bank, N.A. v. Omiya, 142 Hawai‘ i 439, 420 P.3d 370 (2018).  Bank 
of America also seeks remand based on Omiya. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the issues raised and the arguments advanced, there is no 
evidence in the record showing that the certificate of title 
presented to the circuit court was "entered." See Hawai‘ i 
Revised Statutes §§ 501-75 (2006), -83 (2006), and -118 (2006). 
Thus, the circuit court erred in granting Bank of America's 
motion for summary judgment. Omiya, 142 Hawai‘ i at 455-57, 420 
P.3d at 386-88. 
Therefore, we vacate the circuit court's May 9, 2018 
Order Granting Summary Judgment and May 21, 2018 Final Judgment,

and remand this case for further proceedings. We need not 
resolve Collins' remaining points of error.
