NO. CAAP-18-0000459
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I  
JOSEPHINE ABAD GOREE, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
JUSTIN ELEU GOREE, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-D NO. 16-1-7423)
 
ORDER GRANTING AUGUST 7, 2018 MOTION TO
DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Chan, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of (1) Plaintiff-Appellee Josephine
 
Abad Goree's (Josephine Goree) August 7, 2018 motion to dismiss
 
appellate court case number CAAP-18-0000459 for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction, (2) the lack of any memorandum by Defendant-
Appellant Justin Eleu Goree (Justin Goree) in response to
 Josephine Goree's August 7, 2018 motion, and (3) the record, it
 appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction over Justin Goree's
 appeal from the Honorable Kevin A. Souza's April 11, 2018
 interlocutory order requiring the parties to submit names of
 three realtors and to list a real property parcel for sale within
 seven days because the family court has not yet dissolved the
 marriage that is the subject of the underlying divorce case.
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 571-54 (2006), which
 
provides that "[a]n interested party, aggrieved by any order or
 decree of the court, may appeal to the intermediate appellate
 court for review of questions of law and fact 
upon the same terms
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and conditions as in other cases in the circuit court, and review
 
shall be governed by chapter 602, except as hereinafter
 provided." (Emphasis added). In circuit court cases, aggrieved
 parties may appeal from "final judgments, orders or decrees[.]" 
HRS ยง 641-1(a) (2016). Consequently, under HRS ยง 571-54,
 "appeals in family court cases, as in other civil cases, may be
 taken only from (1) a final judgment, order, or decree, . . . or
 (2) a certified interlocutory order." In re Doe, 96 Hawai' i 272, 
283, 30 P.3d 878, 889 (2001) (citations omitted). Rule 54(a) of the Hawai' i Family Court Rules provides that the term 
"'[j]udgment' as used in these rules includes a decree and any order from which an appeal lies." In this divorce case, the April 11, 2018 interlocutory order is a component part of family court's adjudication of part (4) of the divorce case involving the division and distribution of property and debts, which, in turn, is eligible for appellate review under HRS ยง 571-54 only if the family court has previously or simultaneously dissolved the marriage of the plaintiff and defendant: 
Hawaii divorce cases involve a maximum of four
 
discrete parts: (1) dissolution of the marriage; (2) child
custody, visitation, and support; (3) spousal support; and
 (4) division and distribution of property and debts. Black
 
v. Black 
, 6 Haw. App. [493], 728 P.2d 1303 (1986). In
 
Cleveland v. Cleveland, 57 Haw. 519, 559 P.2d 744 (1977),
the Hawaii Supreme Court held that an order which finally
decides parts (1) and (4) is final and appealable even if
part (2) remains undecided. Although we recommend that,
except in exceptionally compelling circumstances, all parts
be decided simultaneously and that part (1) not be finally
decided prior to a decision on all the other parts, we
conclude that an order which finally decides part (1) is
final and appealable when decided even if parts (2), (3),
and (4) remain undecided; that parts (2), (3), and (4) are
each separately final and appealable as and when they are
decided, but only if part (1) has previously or
simultaneously been decided; and that if parts (2), (3),
and/or (4) have been decided before part (1) has been
finally decided, they become final and appealable when part
(1) is finally decided.
 
Eaton v. Eaton, 7 Haw. App. 111, 118-19, 748 P.2d 801, 805 (1987)
 
(footnote omitted; emphases added). Even when the family court
 formally dissolves the couple's marriage at some time in the
 future, the April 11, 2018 interlocutory order will not be
 eligible for appellate review until the family court finally
 determines all issues in part (4) of the divorce case, namely the
 division and distribution of property and debts. The record on
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appeal reveals that the family court has neither dissolved the
 
couple's marriage nor finally determined part (4) of the divorce
 case. Absent an appealable final decree or appealable final
 order, Justin Goree's appeal from the April 11, 2018
 interlocutory order is premature, and we lack appellate
 jurisdiction.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Josephine Goree's
 
August 7, 2018 motion to dismiss this appeal is granted, and
 appellate court case number CAAP-18-0000459 is dismissed for lack
 of appellate jurisdiction.
