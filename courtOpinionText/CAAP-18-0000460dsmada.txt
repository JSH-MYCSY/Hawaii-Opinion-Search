APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 15-1-2007)
 
ORDER GRANTING JULY 17, 2018 MOTION TO
DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Chan, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of (1) Plaintiff-Appellee Pennymac
 
Loan Services, LLC's (Pennymac Loan Services), July 17, 2018
 
motion to dismiss appellate court case number CAAP-18-0000460 for
 lack of appellate jurisdiction, (2) the lack of any memorandum by
 Defendant-Appellant Susan Tawney (Tawney), Replacement Special
 Administrator of the Estate of Mark Charles Miyoshi, 
pro se, in
 
response to Pennymac Loan Services' July 17, 2018 motion, and
 (3) the record, it appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction
 over Tawney's appeal from the Honorable James H. Ashford's
 June 19, 2018 interlocutory order denying Tawney's April 23, 2018
 motion to dismiss this foreclosure case with prejudice. 
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 667-51 (2016)
 
authorizes appeals from three different types of judgments in a
 
foreclosure case such as this:
 
§ 667-51 Appeals. (a) Without limiting the class of
orders not specified in section 641-1 from which appeals may
also be taken, the following orders entered in a foreclosure
case shall be final and appealable:
 
(1)	 A judgment entered on a decree of foreclosure,
and if the judgment incorporates an order of
sale or an adjudication of a movant's right to a
deficiency judgment, or both, then the order of
sale or the adjudication of liability for the
deficiency judgment also shall be deemed final
and appealable;
 
(2)	 A judgment entered on an order confirming the
sale of the foreclosed property, if the circuit
court expressly finds that no just reason for
delay exists, and certifies the judgment as
final pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Hawaii Rules
of Civil Procedure; and
 
(3)	 A deficiency judgment; provided that no appeal
from a deficiency judgment shall raise issues
relating to the judgment debtor’s liability for
the deficiency judgment (as opposed to the
amount of the deficiency judgment), nor shall
the appeal affect the finality of the transfer
of title to the foreclosed property pursuant to
the order confirming sale.
 
(b) An appeal shall be taken in the manner and within
the time provided by the rules of court.
 
HRS § 667-51 (emphases added). In the instant case, the circuit
 
court has already entered a September 20, 2017 judgment on a
 decree of foreclosure in favor of Pennymac Loan Services and
 against Tawney and the other defendants in Civil No. 15-1-2007-10
 (JHA), which was immediately appealable pursuant to HRS § 667­51(a)(1). However, no party timely appealed within thirty days
 after entry of the September 20, 2017 judgment on the decree of
 foreclosure, as Rule 4(a)(1) of the Hawai' i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure required. Consequently, the circuit court has
 proceeded forward with the second phase of this foreclosure case
 in which the circuit court decides whether it should confirm the
 eventual sale of the foreclosed property. 
During this second phase, Tawney filed her April 23,
 
2018 motion to dismiss this case with prejudice, which the
 circuit court denied by way of the June 19, 2018 interlocutory
 order. However, the circuit court has not yet determined whether

it will confirm the sale of the foreclosed property, and, thus, 
the circuit court has not yet concluded the second phase of this foreclosure case with a corresponding judgment that is certified for appeal under Rule 54(b) of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP), as HRS § 667-51(a)(2) requires for any appeal from the second phase of a foreclosure case. Absent an appealable HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified judgment that concludes the second phase of this foreclosure case, however, we lack appellate jurisdiction, and Tawney's appeal is premature. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Pennymac Loan
 
Services' July 17, 2018 motion to dismiss appellate court case
 number CAAP-18-0000460 is granted, and appellate court case
 number CAAP-18-0000460 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
