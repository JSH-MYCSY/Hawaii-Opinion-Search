IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I  
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
ROMAN SEMES, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 2PC151001014(3))
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Chan, JJ.)
 
Upon review of Defendant-Appellant Roman Semes's
 
(Semes) appeal in appellate court case number CAAP-18-0000461, it
 
appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction over Semes's appeal
 from the Honorable Joseph E. Cardoza's April 2, 2018 judgment of
 conviction for Count 1 negligent homicide in the first degree in
 violation of HRS § 707-702.5 (2014), Count 2 negligent homicide
 in the first degree in violation of HRS § 707-702.5 (2014), Count
 3 negligent injury in the first degree in violation of HRS §
 707-705 (2014), Count 4 negligent injury in the first degree in
 violation of HRS § 707-705 (2014), and Count 5 accidents
 involving death or serious bodily injury in violation of HRS §
 291C-12 (2014), in circuit court criminal case number
 2PC151001014, because neither the April 2, 2018 judgment nor any
 prior orders adjudicate Count 6, Count 7 and Count 8 in
 Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawaii's November 16, 2015
 indictment.
  
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
The circuit court has not entered any written order or 
judgment that has adjudicated Count 6, Count 7 and Count 8, and, 
thus, the April 2, 2018 judgment of conviction has not "terminated the proceedings in the case and left nothing further to be accomplished by the lower court." State v. Nicol, 140 
Hawai'i 482, 492, 403 P.3d 259, 269 (2017). Absent a final 
judgment or final order that terminates the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be accomplished, Semes's appeal is premature, and we lack appellate jurisdiction.

Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED appellate court case
 
number CAAP-18-0000461 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, October 25, 2018.

 We note that Keith S. Shigetomi (attorney number 3380) is still the
counsel of record for Semes in this matter before the circuit court and is,
therefore, responsible for ensuring that Semes pursues appellate review, if
any, at an appropriate time and in an appropriate manner under the controlling
law.
