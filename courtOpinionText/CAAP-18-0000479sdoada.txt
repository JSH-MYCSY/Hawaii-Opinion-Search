STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v. 
JASON ALEX KEONI MATTOS, JR., Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
SOUTH KOHALA DIVISION 
(CASE NO. 3DTC-18-070229) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Jason Alex Keoni Mattos, Jr. 
(Mattos) was convicted by the District Court of the Third 
Circuit, South Kohala Division, State of Hawai# i,1 of excessive 
speeding in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 
§ 291C-105.2 The trial court entered a "Judgment and Notice of 
Entry of Judgment" (Judgment) on May 17, 2018. For the reasons 
explained below, we affirm the Judgment. 
1 The Honorable Bruce A. Larson presided. 
2 HRS § 291C-105 (2007) provides, in relevant part: 
Excessive speeding . (a) No person shall drive a motor
vehicle at a speed exceeding: 
. . . . 
(2) Eighty miles per hour or more irrespective of
the applicable state or county speed limit. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
BACKGROUND 
On January 25, 2018, Hawai# i County Police Department 
(HCPD) officer Kimo Keliipaakaua, using a Stalker DSR 2X radar 
device manufactured by Applied Concepts, Inc., determined that 
Mattos was operating his vehicle on a public road at a speed of 85 miles per hour (
MPH). Officer Keliipaakaua cited Mattos for 
excessive speeding. Mattos contested the citation. A bench trial was conducted on May 17, 2018. Officer Keliipaakaua was the only witness called. The trial court found Mattos guilty. This appeal followed. 
DISCUSSION 
Mattos raises two points of error, contending that the 
trial court erred by: (1) allowing Officer Keliipaakaua to testify about the contents of radar training and device manuals over Mattos's hearsay
3 and best evidence4 objections; and 
(2) allowing Officer Keliipaakaua to testify about the speed displayed on his Stalker DSR 2X radar device without proper foundation. 
I. Evidentiary Objections 
The State asked Officer Keliipaakaua to describe the 
contents of the manual that he received when he was trained to use the Stalker DSR 2X radar by Applied Concepts' instructors in December 2015. Mattos objected based on hearsay and the best evidence rule. The court overruled the objections, and Officer Keliipaakaua responded. Mattos acknowledged that 
3 Rule 802, Hawaii Rules of Evidence, Chapter 626, Hawaii Revised
Statutes (2016) ( HRE) provides: 
Hearsay is not admissible except as provided by these rules,
or by other rules prescribed by the Hawaii supreme court, orby statute. 
4 HRE Rule 1002 (2016) provides, in relevant part: 
To prove the content of a writing, . . . the original
writing[] . . . is required, except as otherwise provided inthese rules or by statute. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the State's entire direct examination of officer -- of the 
officer is -- is -- is for the purpose of laying a
foundation  so that the only piece of evidence that matters
in this case can come in. 
(Emphasis added.) The Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) do not 
apply to preliminary questions establishing the foundation for 
admissibility of a radar speed measurement. State v. Rezentes, 
No. CAAP-15-0000294, 2016 WL 6330390, at *2 (Haw. App. Oct. 28, 2016) (SDO) (citing HRE Rule 104(a)
5 and HRE Rule 1101(d)(1)6). 
The trial court did not err in overruling Mattos's objections. 
II. Foundation for Radar Speed Measurement 
"The determination of whether proper foundation has 
been established lies within the discretion of the trial court, and its determination will not be overturned absent a showing of clear abuse." State v. Gonzalez, 128 Hawai# i 314, 325, 288 P.3d 
788, 799 (2012) (quoting State v. Assaye, 121 Hawai# i 204, 210, 
216 P.3d 1227, 1233 (2009)). 
To lay a foundation for the introduction of a radar 
speed measurement, the State must demonstrate that: (1) the 
police officer who used the device was trained as required by the 
device manufacturer; and (2) the device's accuracy was tested 
according to manufacturer-recommended procedures and was 
operating properly prior to use. See Gonzalez, 128 Hawai# i at 
324-27, 288 P.3d at 798-801. 
5 HRE Rule 104(a) (2016) provides, in relevant part: 
Questions of admissibility generally. Preliminary questions
concerning . . . the admissibility of evidence shall bedetermined by the court, subject to the provisions ofsubsection (b) [concerning relevancy conditioned on fact].In making its determination the court is not bound by therules of evidence except those with respect to privileges. 
6 HRE Rule 1101(d)(1) (2016) provides: 
(d) Rules inapplicable. The rules (other than with
respect to privileges) do not apply in the following: 
(1) Preliminary questions of fact. The determination of questions of fact preliminaryto admissibility of evidence when the issue isto be determined by the court under rule 104. 
3 B. The State laid a proper foundation
for accuracy of the radar device. A. Mattos waived any objection to training. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In his closing argument Mattos conceded that Officer 
Keliipaakaua was properly trained to operate his Stalker DSR 2X 
radar.7 He waived any challenge to the training prong. See 
Gonzalez, 128 Hawai# i at 317, 288 P.3d at 791 (noting that 
failure to properly raise issue at trial level precludes party from raising that issue on appeal). 
Officer Keliipaakaua testified that on the day he 
ticketed Mattos, he tested and operated his assigned Stalker DSR 2X radar according to the contents of the manual that came with the device, the contents of the manual he received when he was trained by the manufacturer's representatives, and the actual training he received from the manufacturer. He described the device's two internal self-checks, and how he performed the accuracy test. He testified that the tuning forks come with the device and have their own serial numbers and calibration certificates. Officer Keliipaakaua testified that his Stalker DSR 2X radar tested properly before and after his shift on the day he ticketed Mattos. The State satisfied the foundational requirements for admitting the radar speed measurement into evidence under Gonzales, 128 Hawai# i at 324-27, 288 P.3d at 798-
801. 
7 In State v. Gleed, No. CAAP-16-0000373, 2017 WL 2839547 (Haw. App.
June 30, 2017) (SDO) the majority held that the State failed to lay a
sufficient foundation to establish that Officer Keliipaakaua was qualified tooperate the radar device at issue in that case. Id. at *1. In a concurring
opinion, Chief Judge Nakamura noted: "[W]hile proof that OfficerKeliipaakau[a] had successfully completed training provided or conducted by arepresentative of the manufacturer would, in my view, have been sufficient tosatisfy the qualified operator prong, the State did not present suchevidence." Id. at *2 n.1 (Nakamura, C.J., concurring). In this case, the
State presented evidence that Officer Keliipaakaua attended and passed thetraining conducted by the manufacturer's representatives. 
4 C. The "calibration" issue. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Mattos argues the State failed to establish that the 
radar used by Officer Keliipaakaua was properly "calibrated."  
On voir dire, Officer Keliipaakaua testified that he does not 
"calibrate" his radar device. He explained: 8 
So calibration is something that's done by the
manufacturer, or there are other companies out there that
can actually calibrate your device. 
Um, the two different things that are calibrated that
I use is the radar unit itself and the tuning forks arecalibrated. Again, each comes with a calibrationcertificate of the date and what -- it has its own serial numbers. Again, even the tuning forks have their own serialnumbers. 
Uh, this particular device that I use for -- to
measure the Defendant's vehicle, um, I just received it.Uh, I -- I -- if I recall correctly, um, it was lastcalibrated on October [2017].[
9] 
. . . . 
Okay, like it mentions in here, there's a
recommendation. 
There's no expiration or a time frame where
you have to send it back in for calibration. The only timethat you have to send it back in for calibration is if the-- the device is not working properly. 
And as I mentioned, as it says in the passage I just
read, is that whenever it reads "Fail" that it -- and youcan't -- and you can't figure out what the problem is, thenyou have to send it back in to get re-calibrated. 
And so the accuracy check, um, is done by the officer
and it's described in the manual on how to do that. Nowhere in the manual does it show the user, not only for me, butanybody that purchases this device or owns this device, doesit show you where -- how to calibrate the device. It's only 
8 The supreme court mentioned the "calibration" issue in State v.
Amiral, 132 Hawai #i 170, 319 P.3d 1178 (2014) but that case was decided based
on the State's failure to lay foundation for the officer's training, and thecalibration issue was not reached. Id. at 179, 319 P.3d at 1187. Amiral and 
Assaye both involved the use of a Laser Technology Incorporated 20–20 Ultra-Lyte laser gun by the Honolulu Police Department, rather than the AppliedConcepts, Inc. Stalker DSR 2X radar used by the HCPD; it is not at all clearfrom the cases whether a laser gun (which uses light waves) is "calibrated" inthe same manner as a radar gun (which uses radio frequency waves). 
We did not reach the calibration issue in State v. Portillo,
No. CAAP-18-0000949, 2020 WL 1879621 (Haw. App. Apr. 15, 2020) (SDO)(involving the Kaua #i Police Department's use of an unidentified radar gun)
because it had been waived. Id. at *2.

done by the manufacturers or -- or companies that have the
right equipment or that are authorized to calibrate thedevice itself. 
(Footnote added.) 
Mattos cites State v. Manewa, 115 Hawai# i 343, 167 P.3d 
336 (2007), and State v. Wallace, 80 Hawai# i 382, 910 P.2d 695 
(1996), in support of his argument that the State failed to show 
the radar gun itself was properly "calibrated." As we explained in 
State v. Weber, ___ Hawai# i ___, ___ P.3d ___, No. CAAP-18-
0000478 (Haw. App. June 8, 2020), Manewa
 and Wallace are both 
distinguishable on their facts. In Manewa and Wallace there was no evidence that the State's witnesses confirmed the accuracy of their respective laboratory scales by, for example, weighing objects of a known, certified weight before or after weighing the drug evidence at issue in those cases. However, in State v. Tailo, 70 Haw. 580, 779 P.2d 11 (1989), a case involving a radar gun, the supreme court stated: 
A special tuning fork can be used to check the calibration
of the radar gun . The tuning fork is specially tuned to
vibrate at a frequency equal to the Doppler frequency forsome set speed stamped into the handle of the fork. To test the accuracy of the radar gun with the fork, the officerstrikes the fork to get it vibrating and then holds the forkin front of the radar head. The radar unit will then read the fork's vibration and display the read Doppler frequencyvalue for comparison by the officer with the imprinted valueon the fork. . . . 
. . . . 
. . . [W]e hold that once the State puts in evidence that
the police conducted a tuning fork test indicating the[radar] gun was properly calibrated, this evidence creates aprima facie presumption that the tuning fork itself wasaccurately calibrated . 
Id. at 583, 779 P.2d at 13-14 (emphasis added). 
"Calibrate" means "to measure against a standard[.]" 
Calibrate, Merriam-Webster, https://www.merriam-webster.com/ 
dictionary/calibrate (last updated June 2, 2020). In this case Officer Keliipaakaua testified that he measured his radar device's accuracy against a standard — two calibrated, certified tuning forks that came with the device. Mattos produced no evidence to rebut the prima facie presumption that the tuning 
6 CONCLUSION NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
forks were accurately calibrated. Officer Keliipaakaua's 
testimony established that he in fact verified that his Stalker DSR 2X was "calibrated" to accurately read the speed of Mattos's vehicle. The trial court recognized this when it stated: 
And so the question is, is whether or not it's
accurate, not necessarily, uh, whether, uh, it's been
calibrated. If the accuracy tests indicate that the -- thedevice was functioning properly and calibrated, and as he'stestified he's using tun - tuning -- tuning forks to testthe speed, um, of calibration, I mean that actually doestest the speed calibration of the -- of the equipment tomake sure that it's operating, uh, correctly. 
Based upon the foregoing, we hold that the trial court 
did not abuse its discretion by admitting Officer Keliipaakaua's 
radar measurement of the speed of Mattos's vehicle into evidence. Accordingly, the "Judgment and Notice of Entry of Judgment" filed on May 17, 2018, is affirmed.
