APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
HONOLULU DIVISION 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-18-00029) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Reifurth and Chan, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Molly Hopkins (Hopkins) appeals 
from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and 
Plea/Judgment, entered on May 14, 2018, by the District Court ofthe First Circuit, Honolulu Division (district court).  The 
district court convicted Hopkins of one count of Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 291E-61(a)(1).
2 1 
Hopkins' sole argument on appeal is that the district 
court wrongly convicted her based on insufficient evidence. 
1 The Honorable Randal I. Shintani presided. 
2 HRS ยง 291E-61(a)(1) (Supp. 2018) provides:

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve Hopkins' point of error as follows. 
Viewing the evidence as a whole, in the light most 
favorable to the prosecution, and with due deference to the right of the trier of fact to determine credibility, weigh the evidence, and draw reasonable inferences from the evidence adduced, State v. Kam, 134 Hawai# i 280, 287, 339 P.3d 1081, 1088 
(App. 2014), as corrected (Jan. 20, 2015), aff'd, 137 
Hawai# i 
161, 366 P.3d 636 (2016), we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. See, e.g., State v. Goo, No. CAAP-16-0000369, 2019 WL 1219107 at *2, (Haw. App. Mar. 15, 2019) (SDO); State v. Karamatsu, No. CAAP-16-0000246, 2017 WL 2839545 at *3, (Haw. App. June 30, 2017) (Mem. Op.); State v. Kahana, No. CAAP-17-0000359, 2018 WL 2316511 at *2, (Haw. App. May 22, 2018) (SDO). 
At trial, Officers Garner and Hong and Sergeant 
Sakamoto testified that during the incident, they smelled an alcohol type of beverage emanating from Hopkins. Officer Hong testified he smelled an odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from Hopkins while he stood two to three feet away from her. Officer Garner testified that Hopkins' eyes were red, and Officer Hong testified that they were watery and glassy. 
Officer Garner 
testified that Hopkins said she had come from Maui Brewery, which Officer Garner recognized as a restaurant/pub. 
Officer Hong, who conducted the Standardized Field 
Sobriety Test, testified that while Hopkins performed the horizontal gaze nystagmus test, she swayed from side to side. When she performed the walk-and-turn test, she did the following, contrary to the officer's instructions: on the first nine steps, she missed a heel-to-toe connection by more than half an inch and raised her arms once more than six inches from her sides; to turn around, she made one large turn rather than taking small steps; and on the second set of nine steps, she missed four heel-to-toe connections by more than half an inch and kept her arms raised from her side more than six inches the entire time. On the one-

leg-stand test, contrary to instructions, she raised her arms 
more than six inches from her sides. 
Sergeant Sakamoto testified that when he read Hopkins 
the admonition prior to conducting the preliminary alcohol screening, Hopkins leaned on the trunk of a car and swayed about an inch from side to side. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of 
Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, entered on May 14, 2018, by the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division, is affirmed.
