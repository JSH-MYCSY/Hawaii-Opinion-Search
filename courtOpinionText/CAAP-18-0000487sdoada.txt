v.  
WORLD BOTANICAL GARDENS, INC., Defendant-Appellee  
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD  CIRCUIT  
(CASE NO. 3CC041000232)  
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By:   Wadsworth, Presiding Judge, Nakasone  and Guidry, JJ.)  
Plaintiff -Appellant Walter L. Wagner ( Wagner), 
appearing self -represented, appeals from the Order of Dismissal 
(Order), and the Final Judgment Based Upon Order of Dismissal 
(Judgment ), both entered by the Circuit Court of the Third    
 
   
 
  
 
 
 
   
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Circuit ( circuit court ) on May 22, 2018.1 The Order and Judgment 
were entered in favor of Defendant -Appellee World Botanical 
Gardens, Inc. ( WBGI), and against Wagner, and dismisse d Wagner 's 
First Amended Complaint with prejudice.2 
Wagner argues on appeal that Judge Nakamura erred by: 
(1) not recusing himself; (2) allowing WBGI 's attorney, Thomas 
Yeh  (Yeh), "to represent the liquidated WBGI corporation without 
authority"; and (3) dismissing Wagner 's quantum meruit  claim  for 
back pay, on the basis that it had already been litigated in 
federal bankruptcy court.  
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we 
affirm.3 
1 The Honorable Greg K. Nakamura ( Judge Nakamura ) presided. 
2   Wagner filed his First Amended Complaint in June 2006. The 
Intermediate Court of Appeals affirmed the circuit court's summary judgment 
in favor of WBGI on all claims, except with respect to the quantum meruit  
claim for back pay, which it remanded to the circuit court. Wagner v. World 
Botanical Gardens, Inc., 126 Hawaiʻ i 190, 268 P.3d 443 (App. 2011). Before 
the quantum meruit  claim was resolved, WBGI filed for relief under Chapter 11 
of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, in Nevada federal bankruptcy court. That filing 
resulted in an automatic stay of this State case. In September 2013, the 
federal bankruptcy court issued its order approving the sale of WBGI's  
assets. The bankruptcy court subsequently dismissed Wagner 's quantum meruit  
claim, and issued a Final Decree.  
   
 Upon conclusion of the federal bankruptcy proceedings, WBGI filed 
its January 2018 Renewed Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction  (Motion 
to Dismiss). The Motion to Dismiss requested the circuit court's dismissal of Wagner' s quantum meruit  claim. The circuit court granted WBGI 's Motion to 
Dismiss.  
3   Wagner's opening brief does not meet the requirements of Hawai ʻi 
Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b). Among other things, it fails to 
cite appropriately to the record and to provide legal authority in support of  
(continued . . .)

   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(1) Wagner's contention that Judge Nakamura should 
have recused himself lacks merit. "Decisions on recusal or 
disqualification present perhaps the ultimate test of judicial 
discretion and should thus lie undisturbed absent a showing of 
abuse of that discretion. " State v. Ross , 89 Hawaiʻi 371, 375, 
974 P.2d 11, 15 (1998). 
Hawaiʻi courts reviewing questions of disqualification 
and recusal apply a two-part analysis. First, with respect to 
judicial disqualification, "courts determine whether the alleged 
bias is covered by [Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS)] § 601-7, 
which only pertains to cases of affinity or consanguinity, financial interest, prior participation, and actual judicial 
bias or prejudice." Kondaur Cap.  Corp. v. Matsuyoshi, 
150  Hawaiʻi 1, 10-11, 496 P.3d 479, 488-89 (App. 2021) (quoting 
Ross, 89 Hawai ʻi at 377, 974 P.2d at 17). Second, with respect 
to judicial recusal, "if HRS § 601-7 does not apply, courts may 
then turn, if appropriate, to the notions of due process . . . 
in conducting the broader inquiry of whether circumstances . . . 
fairly give rise to an appearance of impropriety and . . . 
reasonably cast suspicion on [the judge's] impartiality." Id.  
at 11, 496 P.3d at 489 (cleaned up).  
3(. . . continued) 
Wagner's arguments. Given Wagner 's self-represented status, we will address 
his arguments to the extent that they can reasonably be discerned. Wagner, 
126 Hawaiʻi at 193, 268 P.3d at 446.

   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The record reflects no evidence of Judge Nakamura 's 
"actual judicial bias or prejudice "  in favor of or against any 
party to this proceeding. Moreover, the record does not reflect 
an  appearance of impropriety that would have warranted Judge 
Nakamura's recusal. The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying Wagner's motion requesting Judge 
Nakamura's recusal.  
(2) The circuit court did not err by permitting Yeh to 
represent WBGI  following its liquidation in the federal 
bankruptcy proceeding.  
In its Order, the circuit court made the following 
unchallenged findings of fact:  4
20. On April 10, 2018, the Court heard WBGI 's Renewed 
Motion to Dismiss. Wagner appeared by telephone. The 
Court granted WBGI's Renewed Motion to Dismiss, subject to 
confirmation as to the continued authority of the Law 
Offices of Yeh & Moore, LLLC to represent WBGI for the 
purpose of the Renewed Motion to Dismiss. 
21. WBGI's former directors, who are trustees of WBGI 
for the purpose of winding up the affairs of WBGI as a 
dissolved corporation pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes 
Sections 78.585 and 78.590, including the defense of this 
case, has presented evidence that it has continued to 
authorize the Law Offices of Yeh & Moore to assist it in 
winding up WBGI 's business affairs in a number of respects, 
including the dismissal of the First Amended Complaint 
herein. See Submittal of Declaration of Preston Michie in 
Support of Defendant World Botanical Gardens Incorporated's 
Renewed Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction 
(April 20, 2018). 
These findings are supported by the evidence in the record. 
4 Wagner asks this court to review the Order, but does not specify 
which findings of fact, if any, he is challenging. Unchallenged findings of 
fact are binding on appeal. See State v. Rodrigues , 145 Hawaiʻi 487, 494, 
454 P.3d 428, 435 (2019) (citation omitted) .

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On this record, the circuit court did not clearly err 
in concluding that Yeh was authorized to represent WBGI in 
"winding up [its] business affairs[,] " which includes this State 
court litigation. 
(3) The circuit court did not err in dismissing 
Wagner's quantum meruit claim for back pay. We review the 
circuit court 's ruling de novo.5 Ralston v. Yim , 129 Hawaiʻi 46, 
55, 292 P.3d 1276, 1285 (2013). 
Wagner does not challenge the circuit court's 
following conclusions of law : 
4. Walter L. Wagner brought a "back pay" claim in 
WBGI's bankruptcy proceedings that is identical to the 
claim in this case, by filing a "proof of claim" and by 
filing an Adversary Complaint containing his claim in 
WBGI's bankruptcy; 
. . . . 
6. Bankruptcy Judge Bruce Beesley dismissed Wagner's 
quantum meruit and back pay claim; 
. . . . 
8. Wagner did not file a timely appeal of the 
bankruptcy order; 
10. Therefore, Wagner's remaining claim for quantum 
meruit in Count XII of the First Amended Complaint is 
barred by the doctrine of issue preclusion and the matter 
is res judicata . 
5   We apply a summary judgment standard of review where the circuit 
court's order reflects that it considered the bankruptcy court's order, which 
was outside the pleadings, and Wagner was given a reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent by WBGI's motion. Goran Pleho, LLC v. 
Lacy, 144 Hawaiʻ i 224, 236, 439 P.3d 176, 188 (2019) ("[A] motion seeking 
dismissal of a complaint is transformed into a Hawai ʻi Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) Rule 56 motion for summary judgment when the circuit court 
considers matters outside the pleadings.") (citation omitted).  
5    
 
    
 
  
 
   
 
  
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Nevada bankruptcy court's issuance of the 
March  2017 order is not disputed.   And the plain language of 
that order establishes that, consistent with the circuit court's 
conclusions in this case, the federal bankruptcy court had 
resolved the back pay matter in WBGI's  favor. The federal 
bankruptcy court concluded  that "Wagner has been paid more than 
he claimed,"  and that WBGI provided "unrefuted evidence "  that 
Wagner's claim for back pay was "discharged as a matter of law. "   6 
The test for establishing res judicata was satisfied. 
PennyMac Corp. v. Godinez , 148 Hawaiʻi 323, 327, 474 P.3d 264, 
268 (2020). ("A party asserting res judicata has the burden of 
establishing: (1) there was a final judgment on the merits, (2) 
both parties are the same or in privity with the parties in the 
original suit, and (3) the claim decided in the original suit is 
identical w ith the one presented in the action in question.") 
(cleaned up). The circuit court therefore did not err in 
concluding that t he federal court 's bankruptcy judgment had res 
judicata effect on Wa gner's quantum meruit claim. 
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Order of 
Dismissal and Final Judgment Based Upon Order of Dismissal , 
6 The bankruptcy court issued its Order Granting Defendants' Motion 
to Dismiss, or in the Alternative, Motions for Summary Judgment; Findings of 
Fact and Conclusions of Law in March 2017. Wagner did not timely appeal the 
bankruptcy court 's ruling. The bankruptcy court filed its Final Decree, 
closing WBGI's case, in June 2017.
