APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
ORDER GRANTING SEPTEMBER 12, 2018 MOTION
TO DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE
 
JURISDICTION AND DISMISSING ALL PENDING MOTIONS AS MOOT
 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Chan, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) Defendant-Appellee R. Laree McGuire
 
(McGuire) and Party-in-Interest Porter McGuire Kiakona and Chow
 
LLP's (PMKC) September 12, 2018 motion to dismiss appellate court
 case number CAAP-18-0000490 for lack of appellate jurisdiction,
 (2) Defendant/Counterclaim-Plaintiff/Cross-Claim Plaintiff/
 Plaintiff/Appellant Ronald Git Sum Au's (Au) September 20, 2018
 memorandum in opposition to the September 12, 2018 motion, and
 (3) the record, it appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction
 over Au's appeal from the Honorable Virginia Lea Crandall's
 
•	 May 31, 2018 interlocutory order granting McGuire
and PMKC's motion to declare Au a vexatious
 litigant pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
§ 634J-7 (2016), and 
•	 August 3, 2018 interlocutory order denying Au's
motion for reconsideration of the May 31, 2018
interlocutory order,
 
because the circuit court has not yet entered a final judgment in
 
the consolidated cases of Civil No. 17-1-1272-08 and Civil No.
 17-1-1842-11, as HRS § 641-1(a) (2016) requires for an appeal

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
from a civil circuit court case under Rule 58 of the Hawai' i 
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) and the holding in Jenkins v. 
Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 
1334, 1338 (1994). 
We initially note that Au's primary argument in
 
opposition to McGuire and PMKC's September 12, 2018 motion is
 that McGuire and PMKC lack standing to appear in this appellate
 case.
 
Generally, the requirements of standing to appeal are:
(1) the person must first have been a party to the action;
(2) the person seeking modification of the order or judgment
must have had standing to oppose it in the trial court; and
(3) such person must be aggrieved by the ruling, i.e., the
person must be one who is affected or prejudiced by the
appealable order.
 
Abaya v. Mantell, 112 Hawai' i 176, 181, 145 P.3d 719, 724 (2006) 
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis in 
original). "In other words, non-parties, who did not or could not intervene, are ordinarily denied standing to appeal." Id. 
(citation, internal quotation marks, and emphasis omitted). Nevertheless, the record reveals that Au's November 13, 2017 complaint in Civil No. 17-1-1842-11 had expressly named McGuire as a defendant when McGuire and PMKC submitted to the circuit court their joint motion to declare Au a vexatious litigant on December 15, 2018. Furthermore, McGuire is a named partner in the law firm of PMKC, and the circuit court apparently allowed PMKC, as a de facto party, to join McGuire in moving the circuit court to declare Au a vexatious litigant. To the extent that PMKC qualifies as a de facto party, PMKC would appear to have standing to oppose Au in his appeal from the resulting May 31, 2018 interlocutory order and August 3, 2018 interlocutory order. 
Separate and independent from the issue whether McGuire 
and PMKC have standing in this appeal, "appellate courts have an obligation to insure that they have jurisdiction to hear and determine each case." Housing Finance and Development Corp. v. 
Castle, 79 Hawai' i 64, 76, 898 P.2d 576, 588 (1995) (citations, 
internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted). "The lack of subject matter jurisdiction can never be waived by any party at any time." Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted; 
3

emphasis added). "Accordingly, when we perceive a jurisdictional
 
defect in an appeal, we must, sua sponte, dismiss that appeal." 
Id. (citation, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted).
 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals to the Hawai' i 
Intermediate Court of Appeals only from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). Rule 58 of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) requires 
that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." Based on HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i 
holds "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. 
"Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. 
One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai' i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008); 
Bailey v. DuVauchelle, 135 Hawai' i 482, 489, 353 P.3d 1024, 1031 
(2015). Where, as here, a circuit court has consolidated multiple cases, "consolidation for convenience pursuant to HRCP Rule 42(a) also causes the cases to merge into one for purposes of determining finality of judgment." Leslie v. Estate of 
Tavares, 109 Hawai' i 8, 12, 122 P.3d 803, 807 (2005). Thus, "a 
judgment or order in a consolidated case, disposing of fewer than all claims among all parties, is not appealable in the absence of [HRCP] Rule 54(b) certification." Id. at 13, 122 P.3d at 808. 
"An appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 120, 
869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote omitted). The circuit court clerk filed the record on appeal for appellate court case number CAAP­18-0000490 on August 14, 2018, which reveals that the circuit court has neither resolved the multiple substantive claims in the consolidated cases nor entered a separate judgment on those multiple claims. Absent a separate judgment, the May 31, 2018 interlocutory order and the August 3, 2018 interlocutory order

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
are not eligible for appellate review, and we lack appellate
 
jurisdiction over Au's appeal.
 
Although exceptions to the final judgment requirement 
exist under Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848) (the Forgay doctrine), the collateral order doctrine, and HRS § 641-1(b) (2016), the circuit court's May 31, 2018 interlocutory order and August 3, 2018 interlocutory order do not satisfy the requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine, the collateral order doctrine, or HRS § 641-1(b). See Ciesla v. 
Reddish, 78 Hawai' i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) (regarding 
the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai' i 
319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding the three requirements for appealability under the collateral order doctrine); HRS § 641-1(b) (regarding the requirements for an appeal from an interlocutory order). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that McGuire and PMKC's
 
September 12, 2018 motion to dismiss appellate court case number
 CAAP-18-0000490 is granted, and appellate court case number CAAP­18-0000490 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions
 
(including, but not limited to, Au's August 31, 2018 motion in
 docket numbers 30-40 in the appellate pleadings index) in
 appellate court case number CAAP-18-0000490 are dismissed as
 moot.
