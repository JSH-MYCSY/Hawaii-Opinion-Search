PKF's other former partners, Lawrence Chew (Chew), Deneen

On April 20, 2016, Oki filed a "Motion to Suppress 
Evidence Due to Issuance and Execution of Unlawful Search 
Warrant" (Motion to Suppress Evidence from Unlawful Search 
Warrant), seeking to suppress evidence obtained from a search 
warrant of bank records of Oki's accounts at First Hawaiian Bank 
and any evidence deriving therefrom. Oki argued that there was 
no probable cause to support the issuance of the search warrant. 
On the same day, Oki filed a "Motion to Dismiss Counts 
8 and 9 of the Indictment" (MTD Counts 8 & 9), seeking to dismiss 
the two counts charging him with Use of a Computer. Oki argued 
that his prosecution in Counts 8 and 9 was unconstitutional 
because: (1) the statute on which the counts were based, HRS § 
708-893(1)(a), imposed penalties that amount to "cruel and 
unusual punishment"; (2) Counts 8 and 9 violated the equal 
protection clause because by being charged under HRS § 708-893, 
Oki was treated differently from other individuals charged with 
Theft 1, and the statute, as applied to Oki, is overbroad and not 
rationally related to the purpose of the statute or the 
underlying offense of Theft 1; and (3) Counts 8 and 9 provided 
Oki with insufficient notice of the nature and cause of the 
accusations. As to his "cruel and unusual punishment" argument, 
Oki also pointed out that there were pending bills before the 
House and Senate in the 2016 legislative session that recommended 
the repeal of HRS § 708-893(1)(a), as it applies to theft 
offenses.8 Oki also filed an "Amended Motion to Dismiss Counts 8 
and 9 of the Indictment" (Amended MTD) on July 8, 2016.9 
8 The bills were subsequently passed and HRS § 708-893(1)(a), as it
read at the time of Oki's offenses, was repealed. 2016 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 231, 
§ 42 at 758-59. The legislature explained its actions as "[r]epealing [the]provision that subjects a person to a separate charge and enhanced penalty forusing a computer to commit an underlying theft crime because it seems undulyharsh, given the prevalence of "smart phones" and other computing devices." 2016 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 231, § 35 at 756. 
9 The Amended MTD most notably provided an updated "Background"
section regarding Oki's "cruel and unusual punishment" argument. The updatedsection contained a more current discussion of the legislative action pending atthe time of the motion.

On April 21, 2016, Oki filed a "Motion to Suppress 
Evidence From Warrantless Search and Seizure" (Motion to Suppress 
Evidence from Warrantless Search), seeking to suppress evidence 
gathered by Nomura and provided to HPD detectives, and any 
evidence deriving therefrom. Oki argued that Nomura was acting 
as a government agent when she gathered company records and other 
materials and turned them over to HPD, thus conducting an illegal 
search and seizure. 
The circuit court held a three-day evidentiary hearing 
on the various motions on September 21, 22, and 27, 2016.10 On 
September 22, 2016, the circuit court orally denied the MTD Counts 8 & 9. The circuit court held that the penalty for HRS § 
708-893(1)(a) did not amount to cruel and unusual punishment 
under the Freitas
11 analysis, his equal protection arguments had 
no merit, and the charges were sufficient and not vague. 
On September 27, 2016, the circuit court orally denied 
the Motion to Suppress Evidence from Unlawful Search Warrant, holding that there was probable cause for the issuance of the 
subject search warrant. As to the Motion to Suppress Evidence 
from Warrantless Search, the circuit court took the matter under 
advisement until October 20, 2016, when the circuit court orally 
denied the motion. The circuit court held that Nomura and the 
other partners of PKF were not acting as agents of the State when 
they gathered information and materials pertaining to the 
allegations against Oki. 
The circuit court entered its written orders denying 
the subject motions on November 30, 2016. 
10 The evidentiary hearing was held to address multiple other pre-trial
motions to dismiss in addition to the subject MTD Counts 8 & 9, Motion to
Suppress Evidence from Unlawful Search Warrant, and Motion to Suppress Evidencefrom Warrantless Search. On the second day of the hearing, the court tookjudicial notice of the documents attached as exhibits to the various motions,including a copy of the exhibits and the transcript from the grand juryproceedings. The circuit court considered these documents in ruling on thevarious motions.

of twenty-eight witnesses testified, including the former 
partners, HPD employees, police officers from other 
jurisdictions, business executives and representatives, and Oki 
himself. The circuit court received "approximately 175 exhibits 
[into evidence,] which included hundreds of pages of financial

On July 20, 2017, the circuit court issued its 
"Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Decision" (Decision), 
finding Oki guilty as charged, except for Count 4, as to which 
the circuit court found Oki guilty of the lesser-included offense 
of Theft in the Second Degree (Theft 2), HRS §§ 708-831(1)(b)12 
and 708-830(2). The circuit court found that Oki caused 
actual and substantial financial loss to the firm as 
follows: 
a) $345,122.74 in connection with the Kaimana/Kamakura
scheme employed from January 23, 2011 to July 18, 2013; 
b) $49,668.70[13] in connection with the AMC Associates 
scheme employed from August 3, 2013 to October 9, 2013; c) $35,483.75 in connection with the Asia Market scheme
employed from July 29, 2013 to November 18, 2013; and 
d) $9,883.35 in connection with the Sumitomo scheme employed
from August 18, 2013 to October 8, 2013, as charged in theIndictment. 
12 HRS § 708-831 (2014) provides, in relevant part: 
§708-831 Theft in the second degree. (1) A person
commits the offense of theft in the second degree if the
person commits theft: 
(
b) Of property or services the value of which exceeds$300[.] 
13 The circuit court appears to have made a typographical error in
stating the total loss in connection with the AMC Associates scheme. Throughouttrial, the parties and witnesses referred to the loss caused by the AMCAssociates scheme to be $49,6 88.70. The circuit court also references the 
$49,6 88.70 value in other portions of its Decision. The circuit court 
incorrectly references $49,6 68.70 at one other point in the Decision.

 On October 2, 2017, the State filed "State's Motion for 
Restitution" (Motion for Restitution), asking the court to order 
Oki to pay restitution in the total amount of $440,178.54, 
distributed as $110,044.63 each to Chew, Takeno, Nakashima, and 
Nomura. Oki filed a Memorandum in Opposition to State's Motion 
for Restitution on October 11, 2017. 
On October 17, 2017, the circuit court held a hearing 
to address sentencing and, inter alia, the Motion for 
Restitution. The circuit court sentenced Oki to indeterminate 
terms of imprisonment of ten years each for Counts 1-3, five 
years for Count 4, ten years each for Counts 5-7, twenty years 
each for Counts 8-9, and five years each for Counts 10-13, with 
all terms to be served concurrently with credit for time served. 
The circuit court reserved the question of restitution. 
On November 20, 2017, Oki filed a Second Memorandum in 
Opposition to State's Motion for Restitution. 
The State filed "State's Supplemental Motion for 
Restitution" (Supplemental Motion for Restitution) on November 
20, 2017, seeking restitution in the total amount of $440,178.54 
to be distributed to the partners first based on the equity 
interest of each partner and then divided equally as restitution 
for lost wages. The State explained: 
13. Regarding restitution based on "equity ownership
interest", the prosecution is requesting that the Court
order that Defendant pay restitution as follows: 
Lawrence Chew: 10.19% equity
10.19% of $440,178.54 equals $44,854.19 
Dwayne Takeno: 5.66% equity
5.66% of $440,178.54 equals $24,914.10 
Deneen Nakashima: 5.66% equity
5.66% of $440,178.54 equals $24,914.10 
Trisha Nomura: 3.77% equity
3.77% of $440,178.54 equals $16,594.73 
Total restitution based on equity ownership: $111,277.12 
. . . . 
20. Regarding restitution based on "lost wages", 
12 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 therefore, the prosecution is requesting that the balance of
the $440,178.54 be divided equally by four and that it bedesignated as "lost wages" sustained by Chew, Takeno,Nakashima, and Nomura, pursuant to State v. Demello. The basic calculation is as follows: 
$440,178.54 (total losses proven at trial) 
- $111,277.12 (aggregate equity ownership interestrestitution amount)
= $328,901.42 (remaining balance owed to be
designated as "lost wages") 
21. The balance of $440,178.54 after deducting the
partners' "equity ownership interest" is $328,901.42. The prosecution is requesting that that amount be divided byfour to reflect restitution for "lost wages". $328,901.42divided by 4 equals $82,225.35. 
22. Thus, the prosecution is requesting that the
Court issue a free-standing order of restitution that ordersthat Defendant pay restitution to Chew, Takeno, Nakashima,and Nomura as follows: 
Lawrence Chew: $82,225.35 (lost wages)
$44,854.19 (equity ownership)Total: $127,079.54 
Dwayne Takeno: $82,225.35 (lost wages)
$24,914.10 (equity ownership)Total: $107,139.45 
Deneen Nakashima: $82,225.35 (lost wages)
$24,914.10 (equity ownership)Total: $107,139.45 
Trisha Nomura: $82,225.35 (lost wages)
$16,594.73 (equity ownership)Total: $98,820.08 
(Emphases omitted and original formatting altered.) 
Oki filed a response to the Supplemental Motion for
Restitution on December 11, 2017.  
On May 22 and 24, 2018, the circuit court held a 
hearing to address the motion for restitution. 
The circuit court 
took judicial notice of the records and files in this matter, 
including the Presentence Diagnosis and Report (Presentence 
Report) prepared by the Adult Client Services Branch. As part of 
the Presentence Report, Nomura, Nakashima, Takeno, and Chew had 
submitted victim impact statements and requests for restitution. 
Spire had also submitted a victim impact statement and request 
13  
        
            
               
      
           
           
           
            
           
    
           
              
          
         
            
         NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
for restitution.14 The circuit court also noted that it had 
received letters from Grant Thornton, LLP, (Grant Thornton) and 
Spire, asserting rights to restitution payments.15 
Chew, Takeno, Nakashima, and Nomura all testified as to 
their asserted losses. As support for their requests for 
restitution, each partner submitted a spreadsheet and documents 
indicating the amount of guaranteed payments they asserted they 
should have received during the relevant years and compared it to 
the amount of compensation actually received during that time. 
The difference between the two values was what they calculated to 
be their lost wages due to Oki's crimes. The partners asserted 
that their losses were a result of Oki's crimes because, if Oki 
had not committed theft of PKF's funds, the firm would have had 
the cash resources to pay the partners' compensations and other 
expenses. On cross-examination, the partners testified that 
there was no formal written agreement as to the amounts of the 
partners' guaranteed payments. 
The circuit court also allowed a representative of 
Spire to make a statement at the restitution hearing, but did not 
allow a representative from Grant Thornton to do so. 
The circuit court orally ruled on the motion for 
restitution, granting it in part and denying it in part. The 
circuit court held: 
[T]he Court will find that the State has met its burden of 
14 The Presentence Report listed the victims as Nomura, Nakashima,
Takeno, and Chew, but noted that it had also contacted Spire because Oki's
attorney had stated that PKF was named as a victim in the present matter and thatPKF had changed its name to Spire. 
15 Grant Thornton asserted that PKF had not yet paid the purchase price
for acquiring its accounting practice from Grant Thornton and that Grant Thorntonwas therefore PKF's largest creditor. Grant Thornton stated: "It would be grossly unfair for any restitution payments to go to former (or current) partnersin PKF/Spire without being used to pay down the still-existing, and past-due,debt owed to Grant Thornton." 
Spire asserted that it was the direct victim in the matter because
it was the entity formerly known as PKF and that Spire was left in significantdebt after the former partners compensated themselves during their ownership andthen left the partnership without satisfying the firm's outstanding obligations.Spire contended that it resorted to submitting a letter directly to the courtbecause the State refused to acknowledge Spire as a victim. 
14            
            
            
            
        NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
proving that the total amount of loss in this case as
reflected previously in the Court's written decision in theamount of $440,178.54, and that that loss was caused by Mr.Oki's crimes. 
The Court finds that [sic] this amount to be
reasonable and verified based upon the evidence adduced attrial and during the course of these -- this hearing, andthat the State charged and proved that at trial that thedefendant committed the four different thefts that were charged in Counts 1 through 4 against the victims identifiedas PKF Pacific Hawaii, LLP, including but not limited to,Lawrence Chew, Deneen Nakashima, Dwayne T[a]keno, and TrishaNomura in their capacity as partners of PKF Pacific Hawaii,LLP. 
And so here, the term "victim" really does broadly
encompass both the business entity as well as these namedpartners, and these partners are victims, not in theirindividual capacity, but only by virtue of their position aspartners of this particular firm. And clearly thepartnership is entitled to restitution from the defendant.Clearly, the four partners are entitled to restitution fromthe defendant, but only in their capacity as partners ofPKF. 
And then to the extent that Spire comes along at a
later date after these crimes have been committed and reallystands in the shoes of PKF -- it's the same entity rebranded-- while there may be certain agreements that may or may nothave been made as to what Spire took on, for all intents andpurposes, the Court is looking at Spire as standing in theshoes of PKF. 
On May 24, 2018, the circuit court entered its Amended 
Judgment, which additionally ordered Oki to pay $440,158.54  in 
restitution as follows: 16
Count 1: $345,122.74 (Kaimana/Kamakura)
(from January 23, 2011 to July 18, 2013) 
Count 2: $49,668.70 (AMC Associates)
(from August 3, 2013 to October 9, 2013) 
Count 3: $35,483.75 (Asia Market)
(from July 29, 2013 to November 18, 2013) 
Count 4: $9,883.35 (Sumitomo)
(from August 18, 2013 to October 8, 2013) 
Defendant is ordered to pay restitution to PKF Pacific
Hawaii, LLP, including but not limited to Lawrence Chew,Deneen Nakashima, Dwayne Takeno & Trisha Nomura in their 
16 As discussed supra in footnote 13, it appears the circuit court made
a typographical error in stating the total loss in connection with the AMC
Associates scheme. The error further led to an erroneous calculation of the total restitution amount. The actual total losses from all four schemes is $440,1 78.54, but the circuit court awarded $440,1 58.54 in restitution. 
15 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
capacities as partners of PKF Pacific Hawaii, LLP, as it
existed between January 23, 2011 to November 18, 2013. All payments shall be deposited into a designated account andthereafter subject to future claims by the defunct entity,PKF Pacific Hawaii, LLP, its former partners, as well as,any other entity including Spire, LLP and Grant Thornton,LLP, able to establish a legally recognized and enforceableclaim by way of a civil judgment, civil order or settlementagreement. 
(Emphases omitted.) The circuit court also entered a Free-
Standing Order of Restitution providing the same. 
On June 19, 2018, Oki timely appealed. On June 22, 2018, the State timely cross-appealed. 
On July 5, 2018, the circuit court filed its "Findings 
of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Granting State's Motion for Restitution" (Order Granting Restitution). 
II. POINTS OF ERROR 
On appeal, Oki asserts the following points of error: 
(1) the circuit court erred in denying Oki's Motion to Suppress 
Evidence from Warrantless Search; (2) the circuit court erred in
denying Oki's Motion to Suppress Evidence from Unlawful Warrant;
(3) the circuit court erred in denying Oki's MTD Counts 8 & 9; 
(4) there was insufficient evidence that Oki intended to 
permanently deprive the partnership of any property; and (5) the
circuit court erred in granting the State's Motion for 
Restitution.  
 
 
On cross-appeal, the State argues that the circuit 
court erred in refusing to order Oki to pay restitution directly 
to Chew, Nakashima, Takeno, and Nomura, in their capacities as 
the sole partners of PKF at the time of Oki's offenses. 
III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A. Motion to Suppress Evidence 
An appellate court reviews a trial court's ruling on a 
motion to suppress de novo to determine whether, as a matter of 
law, the ruling was right or wrong. State v. Eleneki, 106 
Hawai# i 177, 188, 102 P.3d 1075, 1086 (2004). "[F]actual 
determinations made by the trial court deciding pretrial motions 
16 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
in a criminal case [are] governed by the clearly erroneous 
standard," and "conclusions of law are reviewed under the 
right/wrong standard." State v. Edwards, 96 Hawai# i 224, 231, 30 
P.3d 238, 245 (2001) (quoting State v. Eleneki, 92 Hawai# i 562, 
564, 993 P.2d 1191, 1193 (2000)). 
"A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when (1) the 
record lacks substantial evidence to support the finding, or (2) 
despite substantial evidence in support of the finding, the 
appellate court is nonetheless left with a definite and firm 
conviction that a mistake has been made." State v. Okumura, 78 
Hawai# i 383, 392, 894 P.2d 80, 89 (1995) (internal quotation 
marks and citation omitted), abrogated on other grounds by State 
v. Cabagbag, 127 Hawai# i 302, 315, 277 P.3d 1027, 1040 (2012). 
When applying the "clearly erroneous" test, it must be remembered that 
[i]t is for the trial judge as fact-finder to assess the
credibility of witnesses and to resolve all questions offact; the judge may accept or reject any witness's testimonyin whole or in part. As the trier of fact, the judge maydraw all reasonable and legitimate inferences and deductionsfrom the evidence, and the findings of the trial court willnot be disturbed unless clearly erroneous. An appellatecourt will not pass upon the trial judge's decisions withrespect to the credibility of witnesses and the weight ofthe evidence, because this is the province of the trialjudge. 
State v. Eastman, 81 Hawai# i 131, 139, 913 P.2d 57, 65 (1996) 
(citations omitted). 
B. Constitutional Law 
The appellate court reviews questions of constitutional 
law de novo under the "right/wrong" standard and, thus, exercises 
its "own independent judgment based on the facts of the case." 
State v. Jenkins, 93 Hawai# i 87, 100, 997 P.2d 13, 26 (2000) 
(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). 
C. Statutory Interpretation 
The proper interpretation of a statute is a question of 
law that is reviewed de novo under the right/wrong standard. 
Kimura v. Kamalo, 106 Hawai# i 501, 507, 107 P.3d 430, 436 (2005). 
17 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
D. Sufficiency of Evidence 
It is well established that evidence adduced in the 
trial court 
must be considered in the strongest light for the
prosecution when the appellate court passes on the legalsufficiency of such evidence to support a conviction; thesame standard applies whether the case was before a judge ora jury. The test on appeal is not whether guilt isestablished beyond a reasonable doubt, but whether there wassubstantial evidence to support the conclusion of the trierof fact. Indeed, even if it could be said in a bench trialthat the conviction is against the weight of the evidence,as long as there is substantial evidence to support therequisite findings for conviction, the trial court will beaffirmed. 
State v. Matavale, 115 Hawai# i 149, 157-58, 166 P.3d 322, 330-31 
(2007). 
Substantial evidence as to every material element of theoffense charged is credible evidence which is of sufficientquality and probative value to enable [a person] ofreasonable caution to support a conclusion. And as trier of fact, the trial judge is free to make all reasonable andrational inferences under the facts in evidence, includingcircumstantial evidence. 
State v. Batson, 73 Haw. 236, 248-49, 831 P.2d 924, 931 (1992)
(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  
E. Sentencing 
"The authority of a trial court to select and determine
the severity of a penalty is normally undisturbed on review in 
the absence of an apparent abuse of discretion or unless 
applicable statutory or constitutional commands have not been 
observed." State v. Reis, 115 Hawai# i 79, 83, 165 P.3d 980, 984 
(2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  
[W]hile a sentence may be authorized by a constitutionally
valid statute, its imposition may be reviewed for plain andmanifest abuse of discretion. 
Admittedly, the determination of the existence of clear
abuse is a matter which is not free from difficulty and eachcase in which abuse is claimed must be adjudged according toits own peculiar circumstances. Generally, to constitute anabuse it must appear that the court clearly exceeded thebounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles of lawor practice to the substantial detriment of a partylitigant.

(original brackets omitted) (quoting State v. Kumukau, 71 Haw.

Hawai# i 315, 322, 13 P.3d 324, 331 (2000). 
IV. DISCUSSION 
A. Motion to Suppress Evidence from Warrantless Search 
Oki argues that the circuit court erred in denying his 
Motion to Suppress Evidence from Warrantless Search. Oki 
contends that Nomura and the other PKF partners conducted an 
illegal, warrantless search because they were acting as agents of 
the State, rather than as private individuals, when they accessed 
the firm's files and gathered numerous documents to submit to 
HPD. Therefore, Oki argues, the documents provided to HPD by 
Nomura and the other partners should have been suppressed. 
The proponent of the motion to suppress has the burden of
establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that thestatements or items sought to be excluded were unlawfullysecured and that his or her right to be free fromunreasonable searches or seizures was violated under the fourth amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 7 of the Hawai #i Constitution. 
State v. Spillner, 116 Hawai# i 351, 357, 173 P.3d 498, 504 (2007) 
(quoting State v. Kaleohano, 99 Hawai# i 370, 375, 56 P.3d 138, 
143 (2002)). 
The fourth amendment to the United States Constitution 
and article I, section 7 of the Hawai# i Constitution "ensure that 
an individual's legitimate expectations of privacy will not be 
subjected to unreasonable governmental intrusions." State v. 
Kahoonei, 83 Hawai# i 124, 129, 925 P.2d 294, 299 (1996) (quoting 
State v. Meyer, 78 Hawai# i 308, 311-12, 893 P.2d 159, 162-63 
(1995)). 
Thus, any evidence obtained by private individuals, 
acting wholly on their own initiative, is not protected by the 
fourth amendment or article I, section 7, and is admissible in a 
criminal trial. Id. However, if an individual conducts a search 
while acting as an agent of the government, "the full panoply of constitutional provisions and curative measures applies." Id. at 
127, 925 P.2d at 297 (quoting 
State v. Boynton, 58 Haw. 530, 536, 
19 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
574 P.2d 1330, 1334 (1978)). 
In Kahoonei, the Hawai# i Supreme Court held that 
when determining whether a private individual is a
government agent under article I, section 7 or the fourthamendment, there is no bright-line rule of application.Instead, we must examine the totality of the circumstancesto determine whether the governmental involvement issignificant or extensive enough to objectively render anotherwise private individual a mere arm, tool, orinstrumentality of the state. In so doing, we focus on theactions of the government, because . . . the subjectivemotivation of a private individual is irrelevant. 
83 Hawai# i at 130, 925 P.2d at 300. As to the totality of the 
circumstances inquiry, the supreme court has delineated several 
factors to be considered, including "whether the private 
individual: (1) was actively recruited; (2) was directed by a 
government agent; (3) acted for a private purpose; and (4) 
received any payment for his or her services." Id. at 127, 925 
P.2d at 297 (citing Boynton, 58 Haw. at 537-38, 574 P.2d at 1335). 
According to testimony from the partners and HPD, on 
February 20, 2014, Nomura, Nakashima, and Takeno met with HPD 
Detective Ioane Keehu (Detective Keehu) and HPD Lieutenant John 
McCarthy (Lieutenant McCarthy) to report the schemes they 
believed Oki was perpetuating to defraud PKF of money. The 
partners brought a large binder with over a thousand pages of 
documents, including written summaries of the alleged schemes 
written by Nomura, spreadsheets, and copies of credit card 
statements, invoices, and emails relating to Oki's claimed 
expenses. A copy of the binder's contents was introduced into 
evidence as Exhibit 40 during the hearing on the Motion to 
Suppress Evidence from Warrantless Search. 
The PKF partners testified that the binder was compiled 
while they were conducting their own internal inquiry into 
suspected wrongdoing by Oki and prior to their first meeting with 
HPD. After concluding that Oki was involved in fraudulent 
activity involving the firm, the PKF partners decided to report 
the matter to HPD because they felt they had a fiduciary 
20 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
responsibility to the partnership and to protect the partnership 
and its clients. At the end of the February 20, 2014 meeting, 
Detective Keehu and Lieutenant McCarthy told the PKF partners 
that HPD would conduct an investigation into the allegations. 
When the meeting ended, the PKF partners took the binder with 
them. 
The day after the meeting, Nomura sent Detective Keehu 
an email with an electronic file of PKF's partnership agreement 
as an attachment. Detective Keehu testified that he had 
requested the partnership agreement to confirm that the partners 
were authorized to report the matter on behalf of the 
partnership. Aside from the partnership agreement, Detective 
Keehu did not ask the partners to send him any documents or 
gather any evidence on his behalf. 
On February 25, 2014, Nomura sent the physical binder 
and a hard drive to Detective Keehu. The hard drive contained 
the electronic files of the binder's contents as well as a 
historical copy of Oki's work email account. The decision to 
send the hard drive with the electronic copy of the binder's 
contents and Oki's email account was made by the PKF partners, 
without the involvement of HPD. Detective Keehu did not direct 
the PKF partners to make a copy of Oki's email account or provide 
electronic files of the binder's contents and was not aware that 
the PKF partners were intending to do so until Nomura notified 
him that it would be delivered to him. Nomura testified that the 
PKF partners decided to make a copy of Oki's email account 
because they had concerns about the firm's civil liability for 
financial and business transactions entered into by Oki. The 
hard drive was not accessed until October 1, 2014, when Detective 
Keehu obtained a search warrant to examine its contents. 
Oki primarily argues that Detective Keehu directed 
Nomura to gather evidence and that several email exchanges 
between Detective Keehu and Nomura indicate such direction. 
Contrary to Oki's contention, however, the subject emails do not 
21           
           
           
             
             
             
           
               
           
            
     NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
reflect that Detective Keehu directed Nomura to take any action. 
Rather, the emails show that Detective Keehu contacted Nomura 
several times with follow up questions to clarify his 
understanding of the information that had been provided at their 
initial meeting on February 20, 2014, or in the hard drive that 
he had accessed with a search warrant. It is undisputed that the 
binder provided to HPD at the February 20, 2014 meeting contained 
over a thousand pages of documents. Based on our review of the 
emails between Detective Keehu and Nomura contained in the 
record, we conclude that any instances where Detective Keehu 
asked for evidence17 were not requests for Nomura to search for 
and gather any new evidence, but were instead requests for assistance in locating or explaining the appropriate document 
among the numerous documents in the materials that had been 
provided by the PKF partners. 
Detective Keehu testified that he did not: recruit any 
of the PKF partners to take any action on his behalf, offer any 
inducement or incentive to gather information on his behalf, or 
encourage or instigate the PKF partners to gather evidence or 
information on his behalf. Lieutenant McCarthy also testified 
that he did not instruct the PKF partners to take any action or 
to gather any evidence on behalf of HPD, nor did he hear 
Detective Keehu give such instructions. The PKF partners' 
testimonies established that their gathering and submission to 
HPD of any documents was for the private purpose of preserving 
PKF, was of their own volition, and that they were not instructed 
by HPD to do so. 
17 For example, in an email from Detective Keehu to Nomura, dated
October 17, 2014, Detective Keehu stated: "[W]e need evidence that Oki was
reimbursed for these submitted expenses." Nomura responded by explaining how Okiwas being reimbursed and by directing Detective Keehu to a file on the harddrive.

And the evidence showing that the 'receivable' was paid down by PKF?"

The circuit court found the testimony of Lieutenant 
McCarthy, Detective Keehu, and the PKF partners to be credible. 
"It is well-settled that an appellate court will not pass upon 
issues dependent upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight 
of the evidence; this is the province of the trier of fact." 
State v. Bailey, 126 Hawai# i 383, 406, 271 P.3d 1142, 1165 (2012) 
(internal quotation marks, citation, and brackets omitted). 
The totality of the circumstances in this case thus 
show that the PKF partners were not acting as agents of HPD when they gathered the documents. Therefore, any evidence provided by 
them is not subject to the fourth amendment of the United States 
Constitution or article I, section 7 of the Hawai# i Constitution. 
Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in denying Oki's Motion to Suppress Evidence from Warrantless Search. 
B. Motion to Suppress Evidence from Unlawful Search Warrant 
Oki argues that the circuit court erred in denying his 
motion to suppress evidence obtained through a search warrant (SW 
2014-193) for Oki's bank records at First Hawaiian Bank. Oki 
contends that probable cause did not exist to support the search 
warrant and that Detective Keehu's affidavit in support of the 
search warrant is "based on unsubstantiated suspicions by unknown 
declarants, with conclusory statements that criminal conduct has 
occurred, based on Oki's alleged failure to prove a negative, 
that they were not false transactions." 
The determination of whether probable cause supported 
the issuance of a search warrant is reviewed de novo. State v. 
Navas, 81 Hawai# i 113, 123, 913 P.2d 39, 49 (1996). "Probable 
cause exists when the facts and circumstances within one's 
knowledge and of which one has reasonably trustworthy information 
are sufficient in themselves to warrant a person of reasonable 
caution to believe that an offense has been committed." Id. at 
116, 913 P.2d at 42. "This requires more than a mere suspicion but less than a certainty." State v. Detroy, 102 Hawai# i 13, 18, 
72 P.3d 485, 490 (2003) (internal quotation marks and citation 
23 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
omitted). "Direct evidence, however, is not necessary for a 
probable cause determination by the magistrate." Navas, 81 
Hawai# i at 116, 913 P.2d at 42. 
"The finding of probable cause may be based upon 
hearsay evidence in whole or in part." Hawai# i Rules of Penal 
Procedure Rule 41(c). 
When hearsay is relied upon to establish 
probable cause, however, the courts apply the two prong test in Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108 (1964), and expounded upon in 
Spinelli v. United States
, 393 U.S. 410 (1969). The affiant must 
set forth: (1) the underlying circumstances from which the informant drew the conclusion regarding criminal activity; and 
(2) the underlying circumstances which led the affiant to believe 
that the informer was credible and the informer's information was 
reliable. State v. Decano, 60 Haw. 205, 210, 588 P.2d 909, 914 
(1978); see Detroy, 102 Hawai# i at 18, 72 P.3d at 490.  If the 
information provided by the informant alone is found inadequate 
under Aguilar, "the other allegations which corroborate the 
information contained in the hearsay report should then be 
considered." Detroy, 102 Hawai# i at 19, 72 P.3d at 491 (internal 
quotation marks omitted) (quoting Spinelli, 393 U.S. at 415). Oki argues that the second prong of the Aguilar test is not met. 
Detective Keehu's affidavit asserts that there was 
probable cause to believe that Oki committed the offense of Theft 
in the First Degree and that Oki's bank records at First Hawaiian 
Bank would provide evidence relating to the offense. 
The information providing the facts and circumstances 
establishing probable cause was gathered through Detective 
Keehu's investigation. Detective Keehu stated that he had met 
with PKF partners to discuss their suspicions that Oki was 
stealing money from the firm. Each partner had an ownership 
interest in the firm. At the meeting, Nomura "detailed several 
schemes where OKI deceived the Partners, and used the Firm's 
money for his own personal use without authorization." 
Detective Keehu then outlined the facts pertaining to 
24 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the multiple schemes that Oki allegedly perpetuated to commit 
Theft in the First Degree. For the first scheme, Detective Keehu 
described the following facts: (1) Oki told his fellow PKF 
partners that he was approached by the U.S. government to enter 
into a secret arrangement with the U.S. government and a client 
firm, Kamakura Corporation (Kamakura), under which Oki would pay 
expenses to a third-party consulting firm, Kaimana Consulting 
(Kaimana), and PKF would then be reimbursed by Kamakura; (2) Oki 
submitted multiple expense reimbursement requests relating to the 
alleged secret arrangement; (3) PKF reimbursed Oki for his 
expenses with checks payable to Oki or by direct deposit into 
Oki's First Hawaiian Bank personal account; (4) PKF was never 
reimbursed by Kamakura for the money PKF had given Oki relating 
to the alleged secret arrangement, which exceeded $450,000; and 
(5) Oki did not provide contact information for his government 
contact and the PKF partners could not confirm the existence of 
the secret arrangement through inquiries with Kamakura. As to 
the second scheme, the facts included: (1) Oki informed the PKF 
partners that he began working on a due diligence engagement with 
Sumitomo Realty and Development (Sumitomo) for their intended 
acquisition of Hawaiian Cement and Ameron; (2) Oki charged large 
amounts on his work credit card for hotel stays and other 
services he claimed he fronted the costs for as a favor to 
Sumitomo, many of which were unaccompanied by evidence that they 
were work-related or that any services were actually received; 
(3) most amounts were paid through PayPal and did not have 
supporting invoices; (4) Oki assured the PKF partners that 
Sumitomo would reimburse PKF for the charges; (5) Oki claimed 
that the Sumitomo engagement was part of another secret 
government arrangement; (6) many of the charges referenced a 
"Kishi Sato" who Oki claimed was his Sumitomo contact; (7) Oki 
attributed credit card charges for stays at the Trump Hotel to 
Kishi Sato, but Detective Keehu discovered that Oki and an 
individual named Eunae Harrison were the registered guests; (8) 
25 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
when the PKF partners contacted Sumitomo, they were told that 
there was no employee named "Kishi Sato"; (9) when one of the PKF 
partners asked to be included on emails with Kishi Sato, he 
received an email from an individual named Kishi Sato, but the 
domain name of the sender's email address did not match the true 
domain names of any Sumitomo branch, and was instead a domain 
that had been created the same day the email was sent; and (10) 
PKF was never reimbursed by Sumitomo for the charges, which 
exceeded $170,000 in total. For the third scheme, the facts 
included: (1) Oki informed the PKF partners that he would be 
traveling to New York with a "Mr. Harrison" for work-related 
business; (2) Oki's work credit card showed charges made in both 
Chicago and New York during the time period he originally stated 
he would be in New York; (3) the charges included airfare to 
Chicago and a hotel stay in Times Square, New York, and meal and 
entertainment charges in New York; (4) there were further 
inconsistencies within Oki's explanations for the inconsistencies 
between his credit card charges and the travel plans relayed to 
the PKF partners; (5) the name listed on an airline ticket, 
Eunael Harrison, was very similar to an individual named Eunae 
Harrison who had mail delivered to the PKF office address in a 
previous month; (6) Oki initially stated that Eunael Harrison and 
Eunae Harrison were two different individuals but later 
acknowledged that he had lied and the two were indeed the same 
person; and (7) Detective Keehu's search for "Eunae L. Harrison" 
on Honolulu Infotrack Investigative Query and Hawai# i Driver's 
License database resulted in identifying a Eun Ae Lee Harrison, a 30-year-old woman. 
The affidavit stated that the PKF partners approached 
Detective Keehu to report the matter on behalf of the alleged 
victim partnership, in which each partner had an ownership 
interest. The partners volunteered to provide information about 
Oki's suspected wrongdoing. The partners were witnesses to the 
alleged wrongdoing and parties to the conversations with Oki. 
26            
             
           
            
           
            NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Furthermore, Detective Keehu also corroborated some of the 
information provided by the partners with information obtained 
independently.18 These circumstances support a conclusion that 
the source of the information was credible. See State v. Decano, 
60 Haw. 205, 211, 588 P.2d 909, 914 (1978); cf. State v. Galon, 
No. 29654, 2011 WL 2126425, at *2-3 (Haw. App. May 26, 2011) 
(SDO) (holding that an officer's affidavit provided sufficient 
information of the underlying circumstances to support the 
officer's conclusion that the informant was credible or the 
information she provided was reliable where the informant had 
approached the police as a crime victim and, in volunteering to 
provide information about others involved in drug trafficking, 
admitted to her own involvement in illegal drug activity, and the 
affidavit provided independent information corroborating aspects 
of informant's statement). 
Oki also argues that the facts set forth in the 
affidavit do not amount to evidence that Oki was involved in 
criminal activity. Although the facts established in the 
affidavit may not constitute direct evidence of any wrongdoing on 
Oki's part, we conclude that when the facts are taken together 
with the reasonable inferences from those facts, and considered 
as a whole, they are sufficient to "warrant a person of 
reasonable caution to believe that [the offense of Theft in the 
First Degree] has been committed." Navas, 81 Hawai# i at 116, 913 
P.2d at 42; see also id. ("Direct evidence, however, is not necessary for a probable cause determination by the 
magistrate."); Decano, 60 Haw. at 209, 588 P.2d at 913 ("It is 
clear that only the probability, and not a prima facie showing, 
of criminal activity is needed to establish probable cause."). 
18 Regarding part of an alleged scheme where Oki had submitted a credit
card invoice for stays at the Trump Hotel attributed to Kishi Sato, who the
partners believed to be a fictional person, Detective Keehu stated that hechecked with the Trump Hotel Honolulu and discovered that Oki and an individualnamed Eunae Harrison were the registered guests, and that surveillance photos atcheck-in show a male and female that strongly resembled Oki and Eunae Harrison. 
27           
      NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Therefore, we conclude that the facts and circumstances 
set forth in Detective Keehu's affidavit established probable 
cause to issue the search warrant and the circuit court did not 
err in denying the Motion to Suppress Evidence from Unlawful 
Warrant. 
C. Dismissal of Counts 8 and 9 
Oki argues that the circuit court erred in denying his 
MTD Counts 8 & 9, which charged Oki with Use of a Computer. Oki 
contends that Counts 8 and 9 should have been dismissed because 
the statute on which the charges were based, HRS § 708-
893(1)(a),19 was unconstitutional in that it imposed cruel and 
unusual punishment for using a computer in the commission of theft, and also violated the Equal Protection Clause. Oki 
further contends that Counts 8 and 9 were vague and did not 
provide him with adequate notice of the nature of the charges 
against him. 
1. Cruel and Unusual Punishment We first consider the constitutionality of HRS § 708-
893(1)(a). At the time Oki was charged with Use of a Computer, HRS § 708-893(1)(a) provided that a person who intentionally uses 
a computer to commit theft in the first or second degree commits 
the separate offense of Use of a Computer. HRS § 708-893(2) 
(2014) provided: 
Use of a computer in the commission of a separate crime is
an offense one class or grade, as the case may be, greaterthan the offense facilitated. Notwithstanding any other lawto the contrary, a conviction under this section shall notmerge with a conviction for the separate crime. 
Counts 8 and 9 were charged in connection with Counts 2 and 3, 
for Theft 1. Theft 1 is a class B felony punishable by an 
indeterminate term of imprisonment of ten years. HRS § 708-
830.5(2); HRS § 706-660(1)(a) (2014). Pursuant to HRS § 708-
893(2), if Oki was convicted of Use of a Computer along with the 
19 HRS § 708-893 has since been amended and the provision Oki
challenges has been repealed, as discussed infra . 
28          
            NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
underlying offense of Theft 1, the counts for Use of a Computer 
would be class A felonies, each carrying indeterminate terms of 
imprisonment of twenty years without the possibility of 
suspension of sentence or probation. HRS § 706-659 (2014). 
Oki argues that the enhanced penalty for Use of a 
Computer in the commission of theft amounts to cruel and unusual 
punishment, in violation of the eighth amendment to the United 
States Constitution and article I, section 12 of the Hawai# i 
Constitution.20 Oki specifically maintains that: (1) he did not 
commit any violent offense; (2) he had no criminal history and 
held an otherwise reputable position in the community and in his 
profession; (3) his use of online banking to commit the theft was 
not the type of computer use that the legislature intended to 
criminalize; (4) Hawai# i was the only state that imposed a 
mandatory twenty-year term for using a computer to commit Theft 1; and (5) the penalty was disproportionate as compared to more 
serious, violent offenses. 
The supreme court has held that "[t]he question of what 
constitutes an adequate penalty necessary for the prevention of 
crime is addressed to the sound judgment of the legislature and 
the courts will not interfere with its exercise, unless the 
punishment prescribed appears clearly and manifestly to be cruel 
and unusual." Freitas, 61 Haw. at 267, 602 P.2d at 919, 
overruled on other grounds by State v. Auld, 136 Hawai# i 244, 361 
P.3d 471 (2015). 
The standard by which punishment is to be judged under the
'cruel and unusual' punishment provisions of both the UnitedStates and Hawai #i Constitutions is whether, in the light of
developing concepts of decency and fairness, the prescribedpunishment is so disproportionate to the conduct proscribedand is of such duration as to shock the conscience of reasonable persons or to outrage the moral sense of thecommunity. 
State v. Kahapea, 111 Hawai# i 267, 282, 141 P.3d 440, 455 (2006) 
20 In his opening brief, Oki incorrectly refers to the prohibition
against cruel and unusual punishment as falling under "Section 14 of the Hawaii
Constitution." 
29 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(brackets omitted) (quoting Freitas, 61 Haw. at 267-68, 602 P.2d 
at 920). 
In Freitas, the supreme court adopted a three-pronged 
test to determine whether a punishment is cruel and unusual, 
which directs us to consider: 
(1) the nature of the offense and/or the offender, with
particular regard to the degree of danger posed by both tosociety; (2) the extent of the challenged penalty ascompared to the punishments prescribed for more seriouscrimes within the same jurisdiction; and (3) the extent ofthe challenged penalty as compared to the punishmentprescribed for the same offense in other jurisdictions. 
61 Haw. at 268, 602 P.2d at 920; see State v. Solomon, 107 
Hawai# i 117, 132, 111 P.3d 12, 27 (2005). "[T]he nature of the 
offense and the danger the offender poses to society are the key factors in this determination." Freitas, 61 Haw. at 268, 602 
P.2d at 920. 
In Act 141 of 2006, the legislature amended the offense 
of Use of a Computer in HRS § 708-893 to include the intentional use of a computer in facilitating the commission of theft in the 
first or second degree. 2006 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 141, § 1 at 
390. The legislature's purpose in this amendment was to "deter 
Internet fraud." H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 679-06, in 2006 House 
Journal, at 1368; S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 3116, in 2006 Senate 
Journal, at 1511. The legislature recognized: 
The use of a computer to commit theft is a growing problem
in Hawai[ #]i and the number of crimes that are perpetrated
via the Internet is increasing. 
The use of a computer as an
instrument of the crime offers the perpetrator relativeanonymity, a quick and easy mechanism to commit fraud, andthe potential for sizable financial gain. According to theFederal Trade Commission (FTC), Hawai[ #]i ranks fifth in the
nation in internet fraud complaints per capita. 
S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 3116, in 2006 Senate Journal, at 1511.
Furthermore, the legislature expressly contemplated:  
[Use of a Computer] carries a penalty one class or grade
above the offense facilitated by the use of a computer.Thus, in [sic] any theft where the property taken exceeds$300 would be punishable as a class B felony under [Use of aComputer]. The use of a computer to steal property valuedin excess of $20,000, would be punishable as a class Afelony under [Use of a Computer].

H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 679-06, in 2006 House Journal, at 1368. 
In this case, Oki was charged with Use of a Computer in 
Counts 8 and 9 in connection with the charges for Theft 1 in 
Counts 2 and 3, respectively. In Counts 2 and 8, Oki was alleged 
to have committed theft of over $49,000.21 In Counts 3 and 9, 
Oki was alleged to have committed theft of $35,483.75. The alleged schemes involved Oki creating fictitious identities, 
companies, email addresses, websites, and accounts for online 
payment services in order to obtain money from PKF. While these 
offenses did not involve any violence, we cannot say that the use 
of a computer to create fake companies, identities, and online 
accounts to obtain money far exceeding the $20,000 threshold for 
Theft 1 does not pose a danger to society. Cf. Kahapea, 111 
Hawai# i at 282, 141 P.3d at 455 (denying a cruel and unusual 
punishment argument for a public official defendant who was 
involved in a bid-rigging scheme and was convicted of multiple 
counts of theft in the first degree and sentenced to five 
consecutive terms of ten years each, citing the "destructive, 
deceitful, and wasteful, albeit nonviolent, character of 
[defendant's] offenses," despite the defendant's arguments that, 
inter alia, he lived a law-abiding life for a substantial period 
of time prior to his offenses (emphasis added)). Oki's use of 
the computer--specifically, using his work credit card to deposit 
money into accounts for online payment services that he created 
under the guise of fictitious companies, and later transferring 
the money to his personal bank accounts--fall within the purview 
of the type of conduct the legislature intended to prevent and 
21 During the grand jury proceedings, Detective Keehu testified that
Count 2 was based on theft of $49,688.70, while Count 8 was based on theft of
$49,250.96. Counts 2 and 8 were both based on the AMC Associates scheme, wherein
Oki was alleged to have used his work credit card to deposit money into a Squareaccount, and then transfer the money to his personal American Savings Bankaccount. Oki allegedly deposited $49,688.70 from his work credit card into his
Square account, and then transferred $49,250.96 to his American Savings Bankaccount. The lesser dollar amount was "attributed to the fees that Square takesoff of each transaction."

subject to an enhanced penalty.  See Solomon, 107 Hawai# i at
132, 111 P.3d at 27 (examining the legislative purpose in 
enacting a statute and finding that it evinced the danger the
offense posed to society). 22 
 
As to the second prong of the Freitas test, compared to
the penalties prescribed for more serious crimes, a sentence of 
twenty years for the use of a computer in committing first degree
theft is not so disproportionate as to "shock the conscience of 
reasonable persons or to outrage the moral sense of the 
community, in light of developing concepts of decency and 
fairness." Kahapea, 111 Hawai# i at 282, 141 P.3d at 455. For 
example, the more serious offenses of first degree murder, first degree attempted murder, and second degree murder that is 
unnecessarily torturous to a victim, carry sentences of life 
imprisonment without the possibility of parole. HRS § 706-656 
(2014), HRS § 706-657 (2014). 
Classifying the use of a computer 
to commit first degree theft as a class A felony is comparable tothe classification of other computer crimes as class A felonies. 
See HRS § 708-892(2) (2014) ("Computer damage in the first degree
is a class A felony."); HRS § 708-891(2) (2014) ("Computer fraud  
 
 
 
22 Oki also contends that the legislature's decision to remove theft
from the purview of HRS § 708-893 in 2016 supports his argument that the statute
imposed cruel and unusual punishment. See 2016 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 231, § 42 at 
758-59. Oki specifically points to House Bill 2561, which led to the removal oftheft in the first or second degree as underlying offenses that would subject aperson to the separate offense of Use of a Computer and enhanced penalties. See 
H.B. 2561, 28th Leg., Reg. Sess. (2016). House Bill 2561 recommended amending
HRS § 708-893 by "[r]epealing a provision that subjects a person to a separatecharge and enhanced penalty for using a computer to commit an underlying theftcrime because it seems unduly harsh , given the prevalence of 'smart phones' and
other computing devices." Id. (emphasis added). Oki argues that the
legislature's description of the provision as "unduly harsh" lends support to hisargument that the statute unconstitutionally imposes cruel and unusualpunishment. 
We do not agree that the legislature's characterization of the
provision as "unduly harsh" indicates an acknowledgment that the statute violatedthe protection against cruel and unusual punishment. The Act contained a savingsclause, providing that the repeal of the provision held only proactive effect anddid not have any retroactive effect: "This Act does not affect rights and dutiesthat matured, penalties that were incurred, and proceedings that were begunbefore its effective date[.]" 2016 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 231, § 70 at 775. If the legislature intended to, it could have made the law have retroactive effect, butit did not.

in the first degree is a class A felony."); HRS § 708-895.5(2)
(2014) ("Unauthorized computer access in the first degree is a

As to the third and final prong of the Freitas test, it
appears that Michigan is the only other state that has a separateoffense for the use of a computer in the commission of a crime. 
See Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. § 752.796 (West 2020).  Michigan 
limits the additional penalty for the use of a computer in the commission of a crime to the maximum term of imprisonment 
prescribed for the underlying crime. See Mich. Comp. Laws. Ann. 
§ 752.797 (West 2020).  Thus, the third Freitas factors weighs 
2423  
23 Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. § 752.796 (West 2020), effective from
September 19, 2000, provides: 
Sec. 6 (1) A person shall not use a computer program,
computer, computer system, or computer network to commit,attempt to commit, conspire to commit, or solicit anotherperson to commit a crime. 
(2) This section does not prohibit a person from being charged
with, convicted of, or punished for any other violation of law
committed by that person while violating or attempting toviolate this section, including the underlying offense. 
(3) This section applies regardless of whether the person is
convicted of committing, attempting to commit, conspiring to
commit, or soliciting another person to commit the underlyingoffense. 
24 Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. § 752.797(3) (West 2020), effective from
September 19, 2000, provides: 
(3) A person who violates section 6 is guilty of a crime as
follows: 
(a) If the underlying crime is a misdemeanor or a felony with
a maximum term of imprisonment of 1 year or less, the person
is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for notmore than 1 year or a fine of not more than $5,000.00, orboth. 
(b) If the underlying crime is a misdemeanor or a felony with
a maximum term of imprisonment of more than 1 year but less
than 2 years, the person is guilty of a felony punishable byimprisonment for not more than 2 years or a fine of not morethan $5,000.00, or both.

a maximum term of imprisonment of 2 years or more but less
than 4 years, the person is guilty of a felony punishable byimprisonment for not more than 4 years or a fine of not morethan $5,000.00, or both.

in favor of finding that the enhanced penalty imposed by HRS
§ 708-893(1)(a) constituted cruel and unusual punishment.  
In considering all three factors together, with 
particular focus on the nature of the offense and the danger the 
offender poses to society, see Freitas, 61 Haw. at 268, 602 P.2d 
at 920, we conclude that the enhanced penalty imposed by HRS 
§ 708-893(1)(a) for use of a computer in committing an underlying 
theft crime was not unconstitutional. 
2. Equal Protection Oki next argues that HRS § 708-893(1)(a) violated his
equal protection rights under the U.S. Constitution and the Hawai# i Constitution.  
The Equal Protection Clause mandates that all persons
similarly situated shall be treated alike, both in theprivileges conferred and in the liabilities imposed. It does not, however, require that state legislation operate orapply equally upon every citizen of a state. A legislativeclassification which is reasonable and not arbitrary, andwhich is based upon some ground of difference bearing arational relation to the objectives sought to be achieved bythe legislation is permissible. . . . And because a statuteis presumed to be constitutional, the party challenging theconstitutionality of a statute on equal protection groundsbears the heavy burden of showing that the statute isarbitrary and capricious, and as such, objectionable. 
Id. at 271, 602 P.2d at 922 (footnote and citations omitted).
The rational basis standard applies here, where Oki does not 
allege that either a fundamental right or a suspect  
(d) If the underlying crime is a felony with a maximum term of
imprisonment of 4 years or more but less than 10 years, the
person is guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment fornot more than 7 years or a fine of not more than $5,000.00, orboth. 
(e) If the underlying crime is a felony punishable by a
maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years or more but less than
20 years, the person is guilty of a felony punishable byimprisonment for not more than 10 years or a fine of not morethan $10,000.00, or both. 
(f) If the underlying crime is a felony punishable by a
maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years or more or for life,
the person is guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonmentfor not more than 20 years or a fine of not more than$20,000.00, or both.

classification is implicated. Tax Found. of Hawai# i v. State, 
144 Hawai
#i 175, 205, 439 P.3d 127, 157 (2019) ("It is 
well-established that unless fundamental rights or suspect 
classifications are implicated, we will apply the rational basis 
standard of review in examining a denial of equal protection 
claim." (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). 
As discussed supra, the legislative purpose behind 
including theft in the first and second degree as underlying offenses upon which Use of a Computer could be charged was to 
prevent internet fraud in a time when the "use of a computer to 
commit theft [was] a growing problem in 
Hawai[# ]i and the number 
of crimes that [were] perpetrated via the Internet [was] increasing." S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 3116, in 2006 Senate 
Journal at 1511. 
The legislature acted within its authority when 
it provided an enhanced penalty for the use of a computer in the commission of first and second degree theft to combat the growing 
incidence of these crimes. Jenkins, 93 Hawai# i at 114, 997 P.2d 
at 40. ("The question of what constitutes an adequate penalty necessary for the prevention of crime is addressed to the sound 
judgment of the legislature[.]" (quoting 
Freitas, 61 Haw. at 267, 
602 P.2d at 920)). 
Furthermore, Oki has not shown that HRS 
§ 708-893(1) no longer bore a rational relationship to its 
purpose at the time of his offense. See State v. Bloss, 62 Haw. 
147, 157, 613 P.2d 354, 361 (1980) (holding that although a statute was justified when enacted, it violated the equal 
protection guarantee of the U.S. and Hawai# i constitutions where 
it no longer bore a rational relationship to the harm it sought to avoid). 
Oki has not met his burden of showing that HRS § 708-
893(1)(a) was arbitrary and capricious. 
3. Overbreadth Oki asserts that HRS § 708-893 is overbroad because 
"[o]nline banking is not a crime and does not constitute Internet fraud" and that the "Legislature could not have intended to 'cast 
35 4. Sufficiency of the ChargesNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
such a wide net' when it adopted this statute in 2006 
criminalizing so common and innocent an activity as online 
banking[.]" 
"Generally, one who alleges that a statute is 
unconstitutionally overbroad must be directly affected by the 
claimed overbroad aspects. That is, the doctrine is generally 
limited to challengers who allege that their innocent conduct has 
been improperly swept into the reach of the statute." State v. 
Alangcas, 134 Hawai# i 515, 527, 345 P.3d 181, 193 (2015) 
(quotation marks, ellipsis, and citations omitted). 
Oki was convicted of offenses involving Theft 1, which 
is the requisite underlying offense for Use of a Computer. HRS 
708-893(1)(a). Therefore, Oki's asserted use of "online banking" 
is not "innocent conduct [that] has been improperly swept into 
the reach of the statute" as he is a person to whom HRS § 
708-893(1)(a) directly applies, and he therefore does not have 
standing to assert an overbreadth challenge. See Alangcas, 134 
Hawai# i at 527, 345 P.3d at 193; State v. Guidry, 105 Hawai# i 222, 
240, 96 P.3d 242, 260 (2004) (finding that because the defendant 
was a person as to whom a statute directly applied, he does not 
have standing to assert an overbreadth challenge based on 
hypothetical applications of the statute). 
HRS § 708-893(1)(a) 
requires that a person "[i]ntentionally use[] a computer to obtain control over the property of the victim to commit theft in 
the first or second degree[.]" Use of a computer to conduct 
innocent online banking is not prohibited by HRS § 708-893(1)(a), 
and thus a substantial amount of constitutionally protected 
conduct is not implicated. See Alangcas, 134 Hawai# i at 528, 345 
P.3d at 194 ("A court may also entertain a facial overbreadth challenge when the enactment reaches a substantial amount of 
constitutionally protected conduct." (quotation marks and 
citation omitted)). 
 
As to Oki's contention that Counts 8 and 9 were vague 
36 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and insufficient to provide him with notice of the nature and 
cause of the accusations against him, we find this contention has 
no merit. 
"Where the statute sets forth with reasonable clarity 
all essential elements of the crime intended to be punished, and 
fully defines the offense in unmistakable terms readily 
comprehensible to persons of common understanding, a charge drawn 
in the language of the statute is sufficient." State v. 
Jendrusch, 58 Haw. 279, 282, 567 P.2d 1242, 1245 (1977); see Schwartz v. State, 136 Hawai# i 258, 286, 361 P.3d 1161, 1189 
(2015). 
Counts 8 and 9 were both drawn in the language of the 
statutes pursuant to which they were brought and contain all essential elements of the offense of using a computer in the 
commission of theft in the first degree, as well as the 
definitions of applicable terms. Both counts provided sufficient 
notice that Oki was being charged based on his intentional use of 
a computer to obtain control over the property of PKF, as set 
forth in Counts 2 and 3. Counts 8 and 9 were therefore 
sufficient. 
Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the circuit 
court did not err in denying Oki's MTD Counts 8 & 9. 
D. Sufficiency of Evidence 
Oki argues that there was insufficient evidence that he 
had the intent to permanently deprive the partnership of any 
property. Oki maintains that he was simply collecting what was 
due to him based on his capital contributions to the partnership 
and his share of the profits, and that, therefore, the 
partnership suffered no loss. 
During trial, Oki freely admitted that he deliberately 
engaged in misleading and deceitful conduct to obtain money from 
the firm. Oki also testified that he knew that the money was the 
firm's property. Oki used the money that he obtained through his 
various schemes for personal expenses. 
37          
             
 
          
            
          
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Oki testified, however, that he was entitled to any 
money that he obtained through his various schemes. During 
direct examination, Oki testified that he did not believe he was 
committing theft from PKF, explaining as follows: 
I felt like I had been underpaid for at least a couple
years, and based on the Partnership Agreement, I'm entitledto that share of profit based on my ownership percentage.Also, I was authorized to receive advanced distributionsfrom the company or from the firm. I also believe there was no harm made to the firm or to the partners. 
Oki also testified that he did not intend to deprive PKF of any 
of its property "[b]ecause the money was for [himself]." The 
circuit court found Oki's testimony to be "less than credible" 
and rejected this argument in finding Oki guilty. On appeal, 
this court will not pass upon issues resting on credibility of 
witnesses and weight of evidence. Bailey, 126 Hawai# i at 406, 
271 P.3d at 1165. 
Despite Oki's testimony regarding his belief that he 
was entitled to the money he obtained through his fraudulent schemes, when viewed in a light most favorable to the State, 
there was sufficient evidence showing that Oki, knowing that the 
money belonged to the partnership,
25 intended to keep the money 
and use it for himself, thereby depriving the partnership of the money and the other partners of their ownership interest in the 
money. See HRS § 708-830; HRS § 708-830.5; Matavale, 115 Hawai# i 
at 157-58, 166 P.3d at 330-31; Batson, 73 Haw. at 248-49, 831 P.2d at 931. There was thus sufficient evidence of Oki's intent 
to deprive to support Oki's convictions. 
E. Restitution 
Notwithstanding the apparent typographical errors 
25 HRS § 425-110 (2004) provides: " §425-110 Partnership property.
Property acquired by a partnership is property of the partnership and not of the
partners individually." 
HRS § 425-126 (2004) provides: " §425-126 Partner not co-owner of 
partnership property. A partner is not a co-owner of partnership property and
has no interest in partnership property which can be transferred, eithervoluntarily or involuntarily." 
38 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
discussed supra in footnotes 13 and 16, neither party expressly 
challenges the $440,158.54 total amount of restitution ordered by
the circuit court. The parties instead dispute the manner in 
which the restitution should be collected/distributed. In its 
cross-appeal, the State argues that the circuit court should have
ordered Oki to pay restitution of $440,178 directly to Chew, 
Takeno, Nakashima, and Nomura, rather than pay the restitution 
into a designated account, subject to claims by any person or 
entity able to establish a legally recognized and enforceable 
claim by way of a civil judgment, order or settlement agreement. 
On the other hand, Oki argues that any restitution should not be 
paid directly to the other partners as they were not considered 
direct victims for restitution purposes. Oki contends that any 
restitution should be to PKF alone, subject to the partnership 
agreement and any claims by former partners and other entities 
with an interest in the firm.  
 
At the time of Oki's sentencing, HRS § 706-646 (2014 &
Supp. 2017) provided, in relevant part:  
§706-646 Victim restitution.  (1) As used in this 
section, "victim" includes any of the following:
 (a) The direct victim of a crime including a
business entity, trust, or governmentalentity[.] 
. . . . 
(2) The court shall order the defendant to make 
restitution for reasonable and verified losses suffered bythe victim or victims as a result of the defendant's offense when requested by the victim. 
The court shall order 
restitution to be paid to the crime victim compensationcommission if the victim has been given an award forcompensation under chapter 351. If the court orders paymentof a fine in addition to restitution or a compensation fee,or both, the payment of restitution and compensation feeshall be made pursuant to section 706-651. 
(3) In ordering restitution, the court shall not
consider the defendant's financial ability to makerestitution in determining the amount of restitution toorder. The court, however, shall consider the defendant'sfinancial ability to make restitution for the purpose ofestablishing the time and manner of payment. The court shall specify the time and manner in which restitution is tobe paid. While the defendant is in the custody of thedepartment of public safety, restitution shall be collected 
39 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
pursuant to chapter 353 and any court-ordered payment
schedule shall be suspended. Restitution shall be a dollar amount that is sufficient to reimburse any victim fully forlosses, including but not limited to:
 (a) Full value of stolen or damaged property, asdetermined by replacement costs of likeproperty, or the actual or estimated cost ofrepair, if repair is possible[.] 
The purpose of restitution in the criminal context is "not only 
to repay the person injured by the criminal act, but also to 
develop in the offender 'a degree of self-respect and pride' for 
having 'righted a wrong committed.'" State v. Feliciano, 103 
Hawai# i 269, 272, 81 P.3d 1184, 1187 (2003) (quoting State v. 
Murray, 63 Haw. 12, 19 n.11, 621 P.2d 334, 339 n.11 (1980), 
overruled on other grounds by Gaylord, 78 Hawai# i at 152-53, 890 
P.2d at 1192-93). 
This court has adopted a preponderance of the 
evidence standard in restitution hearings. See State v. Demello, 
130 Hawai# i 332, 342-45, 310 P.3d 1033, 1043-46 (App. 2013) 
(Demello I
), reversed in part on other grounds by State v. 
Demello, 136 Hawai# i 193, 361 P.3d 420 (2015) (Demello II). 
Chew, Nakashima, Takeno, and Nomura each requested 
restitution based on: (1) their equity ownership interest in PKF; and (2) lost wages suffered as a result of Oki's conduct. The 
partners asserted that they should have received a certain amount 
of guaranteed compensation each year but did not receive the 
amounts they were entitled to, or at some times, did not receive 
any compensation at all. Their asserted lost wages were the 
differences between the guaranteed compensation they should have 
received and the compensation they actually received during the 
specified time period. 
The circuit court also allowed a representative of 
Spire to make a statement in support of its request for 
restitution. Spire asserted that it was entitled to restitution 
because it was the entity formerly known as PKF. To the extent 
that PKF was the direct victim of Oki's crimes, Spire asserted 
that Spire was now the appropriate entity to receive the 
40  
        
      
         
         
          
          
        
         
          
        NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
restitution payments. 
As charged in the Indictment, the victims of Oki's 
theft crimes in Counts 1-4 were identified as "PKF Pacific Hawaii 
LLP, including but not limited to, Lawrence Chew, Deneen 
Nakashima, Dwayne Takeno, and Trisha Nomura in their capacities 
as partners of PKF Pacific Hawaii LLP." In its Order Granting 
Restitution, the circuit court found and concluded that "both the 
business entity, 'PKF Pacific Hawaii, LLP,' as well as, each of 
the four partners, 'Lawrence Chew, Deneen Nakashima, Dwayne 
Takeno and Trisha Nomura in their capacities as partners of PKF 
Pacific Hawaii, LLP' are 'victims' for purposes of restitution." 
During trial, Oki testified on several occasions that 
the money that he obtained through his schemes belonged to PKF. 
Notably, the circuit court, in its Decision, concluded: 
5. In Counts 1, 2 and 3, Theft in the First Degree,
the prosecution has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that
during the dates alleged, the Defendant intentionallyobtained and exerted unauthorized control over the propertyof PKF, the value of which exceeded $20,000, by deceptionwith the intent to deprive PKF of the property. . . . 
6. In Count 4, Theft in the Second Degree, the
prosecution has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that duringthe dates alleged, the Defendant intentionally obtained andexerted unauthorized control over the property of PKF, thevalue of which exceeded $300, by deception with the intentto deprive PKF of the property. . . . 
(Emphases added.) Thus, PKF itself was clearly a "direct victim" 
of Oki's crimes, for purposes of HRS § 706-646. No party 
disputes that the entity formerly known as PKF, however, now 
exists as Spire.26 An entity's name change is a mere formality 
26 The circuit court also made findings, unchallenged on appeal,
regarding PKF's name change in its Decision: 
81. On September 14 and October 15, 2015, Defendant
filed a separate Statement of Change reporting Lucas Sayin and
Lucas Sayin, LLC as PKF's partners. See, State's Exhibit 195. 
82. On October 23, 2015, PKF submitted a Statement of
Amendment reporting PKF Pacific Hawaii, LLP, had changed itsname to Spire Hawaii, LLP ("Spire"). See, State's Exhibit 
194. 
83. On[] that same date, Spire submitted a Statement of
Change reporting the removal of Patrick Oki and Oki 
41          
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and the legal entity itself still remains in existence. Cf. W.T. 
Rawleigh Medical Co. v. Bunning, 176 N.W. 85, 86 (Neb. 1920) ("A 
change of corporate name does not make a new corporation, but 
only gives the corporation a new name." (citation omitted). It 
follows, therefore, that Spire, standing in the shoes of PKF, is 
the direct victim of Oki's crimes in this matter. 
The State, however, asserts that the former partners of 
PKF (Chew, Takeno, Nakashima, and Nomura) are also direct victims 
and entitled to restitution based on their equity ownership 
interest and their lost wages. We disagree. Oki was found to 
have committed theft of PKF's property despite Oki having a 
majority ownership interest in the property precisely because of 
the principle under partnership law that individual partners do 
not own any of the partnership assets. See HRS § 425-110 
("Property acquired by a partnership is property of the partnership and not of the partners individually."). For the 
same reason, the other partners cannot be found to be owners of 
the PKF funds that Oki stole. PKF is a legally separate entity 
from the individual partners that constitute the partnership. 
HRS § 425-108(a) (2004) ("A partnership is an entity distinct 
from its partners."). 
The former partners' requests for restitution based on 
lost wages also fail for the same reasons. During the 
restitution hearing, each partner testified that their lost wages 
were a result of Oki's actions because, but for Oki's theft of 
PKF funds, PKF would have had sufficient funds available to pay 
the partners' guaranteed compensation. This assertion, however, 
innately acknowledges that the funds were the property of PKF, 
subject to further distribution. 
A point of contention during the lower court 
proceedings was the nature of how the partners were compensated 
Accounting, LLC, as general partners of the firm. See,
State's Exhibit 194. 
42 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and therefore whether the money taken by Oki could be considered 
"lost wages" recoverable by the other partners as restitution. 
See Demello II, 136 Hawai# i at 197, 361 P.3d at 424 (holding that 
reasonable and verified lost wages are recoverable as restitution). 
The partners testified at the restitution hearing, 
however, that there was no formal written agreement providing the nature of the guaranteed compensation, that it was done by oral 
agreement among all partners, including Oki, and that the only 
written documentation were email trails referencing the amounts 
of the guaranteed compensation. The partners' purported lost 
wages were therefore not verifiable by the circuit court. See 
HRS § 706-646 (requiring restitution for reasonable and verified losses suffered). 
Adjudicating the actual nature of the 
partners' compensation, and therefore what each partner was entitled to in lost wages, is a determination that requires a 
more extensive civil proceeding. Demello II, 136 Hawai# i at 197, 
361 P.3d at 424 ("Where lost wages cannot be verified, which may be the case if the victim was unemployed or if the request is for 
expected future income, adjudication will require a more 
extensive civil proceeding."). 
To the extent that the other partners were identified 
by the circuit court as "victims," they were identified as such 
solely in their capacities as partners of PKF. Any claim they 
have therefore only arises from their relationship to PKF, which 
exists as a separate entity. PKF was the sole victim and 
therefore the sole entity entitled to restitution. Any dispute, 
however, as to the proper allocation of the restitution funds 
amongst Chew, Takeno, Nakashima, and Nomura, in their capacities 
as PKF's partners at the time of the crimes, would best be 
resolved in a civil proceeding. Demello II, 136 Hawai# i at 197, 
361 P.3d at 424; see O'Neal v. State, 426 S.W.3d 242, 252-53 (Tex. App. 2013). 
V. CONCLUSION 
Based on the foregoing, the Amended Judgment of 
43 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Conviction and Sentence, entered on May 24, 2018, in the Circuit 
Court of the First Circuit, is affirmed in part and vacated in 
part. We also vacate the Free-Standing Order of Restitution. We 
vacate the circuit court's order of restitution "into a 
designated account and thereafter subject to future claims by the 
defunct entity, PKF Pacific Hawaii, LLP, its former partners, as 
well as, any other entity including Spire, LLP and Grant 
Thornton, LLP, able to establish a legally recognized and 
enforceable claim by way of a civil judgment, civil order or 
settlement agreement," and remand this matter to the circuit 
court to order restitution directly to Spire, the entity formerly 
known as PKF. The Amended Judgment is affirmed in all other 
respects.
