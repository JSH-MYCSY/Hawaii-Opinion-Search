DWIGHT J. VICENTE, Claimant-Appellant/Appellant, v.
HILO MEDICAL INVESTORS, LTD., Employer-Appellee/Appellee,
and AMERICAN HOME ASSURANCE COMPANY/AIG CLAIMS SERVICES,
Insurance Carrier-Appellee/Appellee, and JOHN MULLEN & COMPANY,
INC., Insurance Adjuster-Appellee/Appellee. 
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
(CASE NO. AB 2015-259(H)(S); DCD NO. 1-87-00882)  
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By: Reifurth, Presiding Judge, Chun and Hiraoka, JJ.)  
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
appellate jurisdiction over an appeal by Claimant-Appellant/ 
Appellant Dwight J. Vicente (Vicente), pro se, from the Labor and 
Industrial Appeals Board's  (LIRAB) May 31, 2018 interlocutory 
order denying Vicente's May 14, 2018 motion to vacate settlement, to strike violations, and to remand in LIRAB Case No. 2015-
259(H)(S). 
In LIRAB Case No. 2015-259(H)(S), the LIRAB has not 
yet entered a final decision and order regarding its review of the Director of the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations' 
(Director) June 3, 2015 decision regarding Vincente's claim for 
further workers' compensation benefits for a May 3, 1987 injury. 1

Board appears to have been composed of Chair Danny J. Vasconcellos, Member
Melanie S. Matsui and Member Marie C. Laderta. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
An aggrieved party may appeal a final decision and 
order by the LIRAB directly to the Hawai# i Intermediate Court of 
Appeals pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 386-88 (2015) 
and HRS § 91-14(a) (2012 & Supp. 2018). The appealability of a 
decision and order of the LIRAB is governed by HRS § 91-14(a). 
Bocalbos v. Kapiolani Med. Ctr., 89
 Hawai# i 436, 439, 974 P.2d 
1026, 1029 (1999). 
For purposes of HRS § 91-14(a), we have defined "final
order" to mean an order ending the proceedings, leavingnothing further to be accomplished. . . . Consequently, anorder is not final if the rights of a party involved remainundetermined or if the matter is retained for further action. 
Id. (citation and some internal quotation marks omitted). "[A]n 
order that finally adjudicates a benefit or penalty under the 
worker's compensation law is an appealable final order under HRS 
§ 91-14(a), although other issues remain." Lindinha v. Hilo 
Coast Processing Co., 104 Hawai# i 164, 168, 86 P.3d 973, 977 
(2004) (citation omitted). But when the LIRAB's determination of a claimant's workers' compensation claim for benefits "has not 
been made[,] . . . the requisite decree of finality is lacking 
with respect to th[e] case[,]" and the appellate court lacks 
jurisdiction. 
Mitchell v. State Dep't of Educ., 77 Hawai# i 305, 
308, 884 P.2d 368, 371 (1994) (dismissing for lack of jurisdiction an appeal from an LIRAB decision that adjudicated 
some, but not all, compensation issues in a workers' compensation 
matter). 
In the instant case, the May 31, 2018 interlocutory 
order does not finally adjudicate any benefit or penalty, nor 
does it finally determine the substantive issues in the 
underlying LIRAB case in LIRAB Case No. 2015-259(H)(S), which is 
still pending final disposition before the LIRAB. There do not 
appear to be any exceptions to the finality requirement that 
apply here. Absent an appealable final decision and order by the 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
LIRAB on the substantive issues, Vicente's appeal is premature 
and we lack jurisdiction. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
