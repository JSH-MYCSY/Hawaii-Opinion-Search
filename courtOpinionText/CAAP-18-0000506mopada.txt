Plaintiff-Appellant State of Hawai# i (the State) 
appeals from the "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order

I. Background 
On September 28, 2017, the State charged Defendant-
Appellee Andrew Hinesley (Hinesley) via indictment as follows: 
1 The Honorable Glenn J. Kim presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Sexual Assault in the First Degree in violation of Hawai# i 
Revised Statutes (HRS
) § 707-730(1)(b) (2014)  (Counts 1-3); 
Sexual Assault in the Third Degree in violation of HRS 
§ 707-732(1)(b) (2014)  (Counts 4-6); Continuous Sexual Assault 
of a Minor Under the Age of Fourteen Years in violation of HRS § 707-733.6 (2014)  (Continuous Sexual Assault) (Count 7); Sexual

....  
(b) The person knowingly engages in sexualpenetration with another person who is

2 (...continued) NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Assault in the First Degree in violation of HRS § 707-730(1)(c) 
(Counts 8 & 9); and Sexual Assault in the Third Degree in 
violation of HRS § 707-732(1)(c) (Counts 10 & 11). 
On April 4, 2018, Hinesley filed a motion to dismiss 
Counts 1-6 of the indictment with prejudice, asserting 
prosecutorial misconduct due to the State charging Hinesley with both individual sexual assault offenses and a continuing course of conduct offense alleged to have been committed during the same time period, in violation of HRS § 707-733.6(3). At a May 9, 2018 hearing on the motion to dismiss, the parties stipulated into evidence "Exhibit A," which consists of the grand jury transcript dated September 28, 2017. The parties did not present any other evidence or witnesses. The Circuit Court granted Hinesley's motion and dismissed Counts 1-6 with prejudice. Additionally, the Circuit Court sua sponte dismissed Counts 8-11 with prejudice, explaining at the hearing: 
Now, as to the remaining counts, 8 through 11,
something very similar occurred. Here, the
prosecution again charged a range of time.Specifically, the eighteen days from September 7th,the complainant's fourteenth birthday, throughSeptember 25th, for all four counts. 
The evidence presented to the grand jury
for this range of time consisted of the complainant'stestimony that following her fourteenth birthday she"continued seeing the defendant." The unmistakable 
(a) Either resides in the same home with a minor under the age of fourteen years or has recurringaccess to the minor; and
(b) Engages in three or more acts of sexualpenetration or sexual contact with the minorover a period of time, while the minor is underthe age of fourteen years.
.... 
(3) No other felony sex offense involving the same
victim may be charged in the same proceeding with a chargeunder this section, unless the other charged offenseoccurred outside the period of the offense charged underthis section, or the other offense is charged in thealternative. A defendant may be charged with only o
ne count
under this section, unless more than one victim is involved,in which case a separate count may be charged for eachvictim. 
(emphases added). 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
implication being that the two of them continued all
of the same sexual activity that they had already beenengaging in, from her birthday on September 7th, allthe way until "the last time that he picked her up" onSeptember 24
th. 
She further alleges that specifically on
September 24th there was again penis and finger invagina, and hand and breast on -- and hand on breastand butt. 
In other words, the specific acts charged
in counts 8 through 11. 
However, in addition to already testifying that
they had continued to engage in sexual relations fromSeptember 7th up to September 24th, she also testifiesthat the next morning, on September 25th, they "hadsex again in the morning." In other words, during theeighteen day time period charged in counts 8 through11, as with the earlier 43 day range of time, thegrand jury was presented with testimony that allegedpretty much continuous sexual activity, and not simplythe discrete sexual acts alleged on September 24th. 
So, once again, in this Court's view, what the
prosecution should have done was simply charged counts8 through 11 as having occurred specifically onSeptember 24th, which would have completely conformedto the evidence presented to the grand jury, andespecially since there was no viable charge underwhich the prosecution could rope in all the additionalallegations of generalized sexual activity, providedby the complainant for this eighteen day time period,since she had already turned fourteen. The prosecution should simply not have elicited them fromthe complainant. 
All right. In summary, given the well settled
principles of appropriate charging in thisjurisdiction, together with the explicit mandates ofthe applicable statutes, in my view, and with all duerespect, the flaws in charging counts 1 through 6, andcounts 8 through 11, are manifest and major, andrequire dismissal of all these counts, on variousgrounds, including the simple fact that the grand jurywas not even presented evidence upon which they couldhave found the requisite probable cause to supporttheir return of an indictment for those individual counts, as they were presented by the prosecution. 
Accordingly, the defense motion to dismiss is
granted as to counts 1 through 6, and 8 through 11. 
As to whether the dismissal should be with or 
without prejudice, I have explained in detail myreasoning, because I believe it's my job to do so. Andthat means that, among other things, I stated what Ithink was the proper way to charge these offenses, inconformity with the evidence presented, so that theparties can fully understand, if not necessarily agreewith, my reasoning. 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
There is no question that all of the dismissed
offenses are serious, especially of course the five
class A felony sex offenses. And when you add the factthat the alleged victim is a child, it's hard to thinkof more serious allegations, short of homicide. 
However, as I've already stated, I consider the
instant charging flaws manifest, and frankly, prettyegregious. And when you combine that with the factthat as part of my explanation I have explicitly toldthe prosecution how I think they should haveproceeded, now to allow the prosecution a second biteat the apple would be grossly unfair to the defendant,to the point where it seems to me that to do so wouldbe tantamount to a violation of his right todue process. 
Accordingly, the dismissal of all these counts
will be with prejudice. 
(emphases added). 
On May 25, 2018, the Circuit Court entered its findings 
of fact (FOF) and conclusions of law (COL) as follows, in 
relevant part: 
FINDINGS OF FACT 
9. Counts 8-11 apply to the time period, between
September 7, 2016 to and including September 25,2016, for all four counts. 
.... 
18. As to counts 8-11, "[h]ere, the prosecutionagain charged a range of time, specifically the18 days from September 7, 2016, the CW's 14
th 
birthday, through September 25, 2016 - for allfour counts. The evidence presented to thegrand jury for this range of time consisted ofthe CW's testimony that following her 14
th 
birthday, she 'continue[d] seeing [theDefendant],' the unmistakable implication beingthat the two of them continued all of the same sexual activity that they had already beenengaging in, from her birthday on September 7,2016 all the way until 'the last time he picked[the CW] up,"' on September 24th, 2016.... 
19. As to counts 8-11, " ... [t]he grand jury waspresented with testimony that alleged prettymuch continuous sexual activity, and not simplythe discrete sexual acts alleged on September24th, 2016." 
.... 
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 
.... 
6. In so doing, the Court ultimately found that,"... given the well-settled principles of 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 appropriate charging in this jurisdiction,
together with the explicit mandates of theapplicable statutes, in my view and with all duerespect, the flaws in charging counts 1-6 andcounts 8-11 are manifest and major, and requiredismissal of all those counts, on variousgrounds, including the simple fact that thegrand jury was not presented evidence upon whichthey could even have found the requisiteprobable cause to support their return of anindictment for those individual counts as theywere presented by the prosecution.".... 
7. The Court expounded further by noting that, "Iconsider the instant charging flaws manifest andfrankly pretty egregious ... I have explicitlytold the prosecution how I think they shouldhave proceeded, now to allow the prosecution asecond bite at the apple would be grossly unfairto the defendant, to the point where it seems tome that to do so would be tantamount to a violation of his right to due process.Accordingly, the dismissal of these counts[counts 1-6 and 8-11] will be with prejudice. " 
(boldface in original, emphases added). 
II. Discussion 
A. The Circuit Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in Sua
 Sponte Dismissing Counts 8-11 of the Indictment 
The State contends the Circuit Court's sua sponte  
dismissal of Counts 8-11 was based on an erroneous statutory 
interpretation. Specifically, the State argues the offenses charged in Counts 8-11 are alleged to have occurred from September 7, 2016, to September 25, 2016, which is outside the period of the Continuous Sexual Assault offense charged in Count 7, which the State alleged to have occurred during a previous period when the complaining witness (CW) was under fourteen years 
of age, from July 25, 2016, to September 6, 2016. The State thus 
contends it is not precluded from charging Hinesley with the offenses in Counts 8-11 under HRS § 707-733.6(3), which provides, in relevant part: "No other felony sex offense involving the same victim may be charged in the same proceeding with a charge under this section, unless the other charged offense occurred outside the period of the offense charged under this section." (emphasis added). In this regard, however, it appears the State 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
misapprehends the Circuit Court's ruling, because the record does 
not reflect the Circuit Court dismissed Counts 8-11 based on HRS § 707-733.6(3). Rather, it appears the Circuit Court sua sponte dismissed Counts 8-11 because of a lack of evidence presented to the grand jury to support the extended time frame in those charges. 
The State also argues the Circuit Court erred in ruling 
it was improper to charge a "range of time" under Counts 8-11, noting the Circuit Court did not cite any authority. Further, the State contends that Counts 8-11 are consistent with State v. Arceo, 84 Hawai# i 1, 13, 928 P.2d 843, 855 (1996), in which the 
Hawai
#i Supreme Court stated: 
In general, the precise time and date of the
commission of an offense is not regarded as amaterial element. Accordingly, this court haslong recognized that, in cases involving sexualabuse of minors, it is sufficient, in theindictment, to allege that the offense occurredover a particular time span. 
(citations, quotation marks, brackets omitted). 
A trial court's ruling on a motion to dismiss an 
indictment is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. State v. 
Mendonca, 68 Haw. 280, 283, 711 P.2d 731, 734 (1985) (citing 
State v. Corpuz, 67 Haw. 438, 440, 690 P.2d 282, 284 (1984)). We are mindful that dismissal of an indictment is required only in flagrant cases in which the grand jury has been overreached or deceived in some significant way. State v. Wong, 97 Hawai# i 512, 
526, 40 P.3d 914, 928 (2002) (citing Mendonca, 68 Haw. at 283, 711 P.2d at 734; State v. Pulawa, 62 Haw. 209, 215, 614 P.2d 373, 377 (1980)). 
From our reading of the record, the Circuit Court 
dismissed charges of Sexual Assault 1 and Sexual Assault 3 in Counts 8-11 because the charges did not comport with the evidence presented to the grand jury. For Counts 8-11, the State alleged the following: 
COUNT 8: On or about September 7, 2016, to and
including September 25, 2016, in the City and County
of Honolulu, State of Hawai #i, ANDREW HINESLEY, did
knowingly engage in sexual penetration with P.W., who 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
was at least fourteen years old but less than sixteen
years old, by inserting his penis into her genitalopening and ANDREW HINESLEY was not less than fiveyears older than P.W. and was not legally married toher, thereby committing the offense of Sexual Assaultin the First Degree in violation of Section 707-730(1)(c) of the Hawai #i Revised Statutes.... 
COUNT 9: On or about September 7, 2016, to and
including September 25, 2016, in the City and Countyof Honolulu, State of Hawai #i, ANDREW HINESLEY, did
knowingly engage in sexual penetration with P.W., whowas at least fourteen years old but less than sixteenyears old, by inserting his finger into her genitalopening and ANDREW HINESLEY was not less than fiveyears older than P.W. and was not legally married toher, thereby committing the offense of Sexual Assaultin the First Degree in violation of Section 707-730(1)(c) of the 
Hawai #i Revised Statutes.... 
COUNT 10: On or about September 7, 2016, to and
including September 25, 2016, in the City and Countyof Honolulu, State of Hawai #i, ANDREW HINESLEY, did
knowingly engage in sexual penetration with P.W., whowas at least fourteen years old but less than sixteenyears old, by placing his hand on her breast, andANDREW HINESLEY was not less than five years olderthan P.W. and was not legally married to her, therebycommitting the offense of Sexual Assault in the FirstDegree in violation of Section 707-732(1)(c) of theHawai #i
 Revised Statutes.... 
COUNT 11: On or about September 7, 2016, to and
including September 25, 2016, in the City and Countyof Honolulu, State of Hawai #i, ANDREW HINESLEY, did
knowingly engage in sexual penetration with P.W., whowas at least fourteen years old but less than sixteenyears old, by placing his hand on her buttock, andANDREW HINESLEY was not less than five years olderthan P.W. and was not legally married to her, therebycommitting the offense of Sexual Assault in the FirstDegree in violation of Section 707-732(1)(c) of theHawai #i
 Revised Statutes.... 
(emphases added). 
The Hawai# i Supreme Court has expressed that: 
A grand jury indictment must be based onprobable cause. "Probable cause" has been defined as a state of facts as would lead a person of ordinary caution or prudence tobelieve and conscientiously entertain a strongsuspicion of the guilt of the accused.Furthermore, in order to support an indictment,the prosecution must provide evidence of eachessential element of the charged offense to thegrand jury. If no evidence is produced as to amaterial element of the offense, a person ofordinary caution and prudence could not have astrong suspicion that the defendant is guilty ofthe charged crime. 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
State v. Taylor, 126 Hawai# i 205, 218, 269 P.3d 740, 753 (2011) 
(citations, quotation marks, brackets omitted). 
During the grand jury proceedings, the CW gave general 
testimony from which it could be inferred, as the Circuit Court 
found, that "pretty much continuous sexual activity" occurred between the CW and Hinesley after the CW turned 14 years old, but the CW also testified about discrete sexual acts on September 24, 2016, and the following day: 
Q Did you continue seeing him when you were 14?
Af --
A Yes. 
Q After you turned 14 years of age? 
A Yes. 
Q Did you turn 14 on September 7, 2016? A Yes. Q Did the last time that he picked you up, was
that on September 24, 2016? 
A Yes. Q What happened on that last day that he picked
you up? 
A He took me to his apartment and we had sex. Q Okay. Again, when you say that you had sex,
can you explain what you mean by that? 
A He put his penis inside my vagina. Q Did he touch you anywhere on your body? A His hands on my breasts, my butt, and my
thighs. 
Q And did he insert his fingers anywhere? A Yes. Q Where did he do so? A My vagina. 
.... 
Q 
And what happened after you stayed at his
home overnight? 
A We had sex again in the morning. 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Based on the foregoing, the Circuit Court found in FOF 18: 
As to counts 8-11, "[h]ere, the prosecution again
charged a range of time, specifically the 18 days fromSeptember 7, 2016, the CW's 14
th birthday, through
September 25, 2016 - for all four counts. The evidence presented to the grand jury for this range oftime consisted of the CW's testimony that followingher 14
th birthday, she 'continue[d] seeing [the
Defendant],' the unmistakable implication being thatthe two of them continued all of the same sexual activity that they had already been engaging in, fromher birthday on September 7, 2016 all the way until'the last time he picked [the CW] up,'" on September24
th, 2016. 
(emphases added). What the prosecution should have done, 
according to the Circuit Court, 
... was simply charge[] counts 8 through 11 as having
occurred specifically on September 24th, which wouldhave completely conformed to the evidence presented tothe grand jury, and especially since there was noviable charge under which the prosecution could ropein all the additional allegations of generalizedsexual activity, provided by the complainant for thiseighteen day time period, since she had already turnedfourteen. The prosecution should simply not haveelicited them from the complainant. 
(emphases added). Given the record, particularly the lack of 
evidence presented to the grand jury about any incidents other than on September 24, 2016, and September 25, 2016, we conclude the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Counts 8-11. 
In each of the counts in Counts 8-11, the State alleges 
a discrete sexual act during a period of eighteen days. We agree with the Circuit Court that given the testimony presented to it, the grand jury would not have been able to find probable cause and return the indictment for these alleged sexual acts, other than on either September 24, 2016, or September 25, 2016. "An indictment must enable a grand jury to determine that probable cause exists that the accused committed a violation of the charged offense both as to the elements of the offense and the concomitant culpable state of mind." State v. Stan's Contracting, Inc., 111 Hawai# i 17, 31–32, 137 P.3d 331, 345–46 
(2006). 
10 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
We conclude that Arceo is distinguishable given the 
CW's specific testimony to the grand jury in this case about 
sexual offenses occurring on specific dates. In Arceo, the Hawai# i Supreme Court stated that "sexual assault in the first 
degree, in violation of HRS § 707–730(1)(b), and sexual assault in the third degree, in violation of HRS § 707–732(1)(b), are not — and cannot be — "continuing offenses" and [] each distinct act in violation of these statutes constitutes a separate offense under the HPC." 84 Hawai# i at 21, 928 P.2d at 863 (emphasis 
added, footnote omitted). 
Similarly here, with regard to the 
charges in Counts 8-11 under HRS § 707–730(1)(c) and HRS § 707–732(1)(c), each distinct act in violation of the statutes constituted a separate offense, and here CW testified before the grand jury about specific events on specific dates. 
Given the record in this case, the Circuit Court did 
not abuse its discretion in dismissing Counts 8-11 on the basis that the evidence presented to the grand jury did not support probable cause for the charges during the range of time set forth therein. 
B. The Circuit Court Did Not Sufficiently Address
Why Dismissal with Prejudice Was Warranted 
The State also contends that, assuming dismissal of 
Counts 8-11 was appropriate, the Circuit Court erred in dismissing those counts with prejudice. In this regard, we agree with the State, to the extent the trial court's stated reasons do not allow us to "accurately assess whether the trial court duly exercised its discretion." State v. Mageo, 78 Hawai# i 33, 38, 
889 P.2d 1092, 1096 (App. 1995) (citing State v. Moriwake
, 65 
Haw. 47, 57 n.16, 642 P.2d 705, 713 n.16 (1982)). 
We have recognized the trial court's power to dismiss 
sua sponte an indictment with prejudice: 
Trial courts have the power to dismiss sua sponte an
indictment with prejudice and over the objection ofthe prosecuting attorney within the bounds of dulyexercised discretion. The parameters within whichthis discretion is properly exercised requires abalancing of the interest of the state againstfundamental fairness to a defendant with the added 
11 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
ingredient of the orderly functioning of the court
system. 
Mageo, 78 Hawai# i at 37, 889 P.2d at 1096 (quoting Moriwake, 65 
Haw. at 56, 647 P.2d at 712 (brackets, internal quotation marks, 
and citation omitted)). However, 
a judge's inherent power to dismiss an indictment is not
generally so broad as to dismiss an indictment withprejudice before trial unless the State's misconductrepresents a serious threat to the integrity of the judicialprocess or there is a clear denial of due process, aviolation of some constitutional right, is an arbitraryaction, or is the result of some other governmentalmisconduct. 
Wong, 97 Hawai# i at 527, 40 P.3d at 929 (citing State v. Alvey, 
67 Haw. 49, 57-58, 678 P.2d 5, 10 (1984)) (emphasis added). The 
Hawai# i Supreme Court has cautioned that: 
a trial court's inherent power to dismiss an indictment is
not a broad power and that trial courts must recognize andweigh the State's interest in prosecuting crime againstfundamental fairness to the defendant ... [and] made clearthat, even if "there are serious questions" about a materialelement of a crime, it is not within the trial court'sdiscretion to usurp the function of the trier of fact beforetrial. 
Id. (quoting State v. Lincoln, 72 Haw. 480, 491, 825 P.2d 64, 
70–71 (1992)). At the same time, 
[w]e are cognizant of the State's strong interest in
prosecuting crime, but we are equally cognizant thatthe State's duty is to pursue justice, notconvictions, and the prosecutor has a duty to act as aminister of justice to pursue prosecutions by fairmeans. 
Wong, 97 Hawai# i at 527, 40 P.3d at 929. 
In Mageo, we affirmed a District Court's grant of a 
motion to dismiss an indictment with prejudice because service of 
penal summonses was unreasonably delayed. Id. at 33, 889 P.2d at 1092. In Moriwake, the Hawai# i Supreme Court affirmed the trial 
court's dismissal of an indictment with prejudice for manslaughter following two hung jury mistrials.   Id. at 48, 647 
5
5 The Hawai #i  Supreme Court in Moriwake set forth the following factors
which the trial court should consider in exercising its inherent power to
dismiss a criminal case with prejudice after mistrial: 
(continued...) 
12 (...continued) NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
P.2d at 708. The factual circumstances in Mageo and Moriwake are 
not the same as this case. Nonetheless, the proposition that the trial court has inherent power to dismiss a criminal indictment with prejudice, and that it must do so while "balancing [] the interest of the state against fundamental fairness to a defendant with the added ingredient of the orderly functioning of the court system," is applicable here. Mageo, 78 Hawai# i at 37, 889 P.2d 
at 1096. 
In Mageo, given the District Court's scant ruling that 
alluded to its concern with avoiding unjustified delay, we advised: 
In the future, trial courts exercising this power
should issue written factual findings setting forththeir reasons for dismissal with prejudice so that areviewing court may accurately assess whether thetrial court duly exercised its discretion. 
Id. at 38, 889 P.2d at 1097 (citation omitted). Likewise, the 
Hawai# i Supreme Court has noted that: 
[b]ecause of the nature of criminal proceedings, and
because they are in the interests and for theprotection of the public, there is a sound basis inpublic policy for requiring the judge who assumes theserious responsibility of dismissing a case to setforth his reasons for doing so in order that all mayknow what invokes the court's discretion and whether its action is justified. 
Moriwake, 65 Haw. at 57 n.16, 647 P.2d 705, 713 n.16 (citation 
omitted)). 
Here, the Circuit Court set forth written findings as 
to why the charges were flawed, and at the hearing noted that the offenses involved are serious and involve a child, but the 
(1)
 the severity of the offense charged; (2) the
number of prior mistrials and the circumstances of the
jury deliberation therein, so far as is known; (3) thecharacter of prior trials in terms of length,complexity and similarity of evidence presented; (4)the likelihood of any substantial difference in asubsequent trial, if allowed; (5) the trial court'sown evaluation of relative case strength; and (6) theprofessional conduct and diligence of respectivecounsel, particularly that of the prosecutingattorney. 
Id. at 56, 647 P.2d at 712-13. 
13 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Circuit Court's explanation (both at the hearing and in its 
written findings) for dismissing Counts 8-11 with prejudice was only as follows:
 6
"I consider the instant charging flaws manifest and
frankly pretty egregious ... I have explicitly toldthe prosecution how I think they should haveproceeded, now to allow the prosecution a second biteat the apple would be grossly unfair to the defendant,to the point where it seems to me that to do so wouldbe tantamount to a violation of his right to dueprocess. Accordingly, the dismissal of these counts
[counts 1-6 and 8-11] will be with prejudice. " 
(emphasis in original). Given this record, we conclude there are 
insufficient findings in the record to determine whether the Circuit Court properly exercised its discretion under Wong, Mageo, and Moriwake to dismiss Counts 8-11 with prejudice. The Circuit Court provides no clear reason or legal authority for its finding that the State's conduct was "egregious" or for its view that, having explained the charging flaws to the State, it would be grossly unfair to Hinesley and violate his due process rights to dismiss Counts 8-11 without prejudice. Further, there are no written findings balancing the interests of the State in prosecuting crime, including assessing the strength or weakness of the case as to Counts 8-11, or addressing the orderly functioning of the court system. 
Therefore, we remand for further proceedings on the 
issue of whether Counts 8-11 should be dismissed with or without prejudice. 
III. Conclusion 
Based on the foregoing, the "Findings of Fact, 
Conclusions of Law and Order Granting Dismissal with Prejudice 
6 In his motion to dismiss indictment, Hinesley asserted the following
factors to justify dismissing counts 1-6 with prejudice: (1) the prosecutor's
state of mind; (2) other prosecutorial misconduct because the CW had sex withas many as eight men, but only two were charged; (3) the CW does not want toprosecute and purportedly feels guilty because she initiated contact withmultiple other men for sex and thus was not a "child" as contemplated by theLegislature in enacting the pertinent statutory offenses; (4) the impact ofrecharging the case; and (5) Hinesley's loss of remedies. Hinesley's motion
did not seek dismissal as to Counts 8-11, which were dismissed sua sponte  by
the Circuit Court.
