. . . . Courts of the State of Hawai# i (RDCSH).  The AOAO filed a timely 
motion to set aside the dismissal. The district court granted 
the motion and set a deadline for filing a motion for entry of judgment. 4
On May 24, 2018, the AOAO filed a timely ex parte 
motion for default judgment. The motion was supported by a declaration that stated: 
P. Pursuant to the Project Documents and HRS ยง 514B-157,
Defendant is responsible for common expenses in theamount of $24,826.45 , which consist of the following:

U. Therefore, the total amount owed by Defendant to
Plaintiff is $43,523.85 [.5] 
The Court Order was entered on May 24, 2018. The 
district court reduced the requested total default judgment 
amount from $43,523.85 to $28,546.91. The Judgment for 
$28,546.91 in favor of the AOAO and against Tani was entered on May 31, 2018. This appeal followed. 
The AOAO's opening brief states three points of error:
6 
(1)  The AOAO contends that the district court erred by 
striking the AOAO's first two ex parte motions for default judgment. The district court explained, on the cover sheets striking the AOAO's motions, what information was needed to resubmit the documents. The cover sheets instructed the AOAO to "Correct and return with this sheet[.]" The district court filed the AOAO's third ex parte motion for default judgment. The district court's rejections of the AOAO's first two documents is moot. 
(2) and (3)  The AOAO contends that the district court 
erred by not awarding the full amount of attorney's fees and costs claimed by the AOAO: (a) to collect all outstanding monthly assessments and fees owed by Tani; and (b) incurred by the AOAO in Bank of America's foreclosure action. "The trial court's grant or denial of attorney's fees and costs is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard." Ass'n of Apartment Owners of 
Discovery Bay v. Mitchell, 134 Hawai# i 251, 254, 339 P.3d 1052, 
1055 (2014) (citation omitted). 
The trial court abuses its discretion if it bases its ruling
on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneousassessment of the evidence. In other words, an abuse ofdiscretion occurs where the trial court has clearly exceededthe bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles of 
5 The total amount requested includes $155 for filing fees, $157 for
service fees, and $100 for anticipated postage, duplication, and recordationcosts, less $2,147.04 for the six-month special assessment recovered in Bankof America's foreclosure action under HRS ยง 541B-146.

law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party
litigant. 
Id. (citation omitted). 
The AOAO requested attorney's fees of $11,280.62 and 
costs of $412. Without explanation, the district court awarded 
attorney's fees of $5,555.50 and costs of $312. The record does not indicate why the district court did not award the full amount of attorney's fees and costs claimed by the AOAO, or how the district court calculated the amount of attorney's fees and costs it awarded. 
We cannot determine, based on the record, whether or 
not the district court abused its discretion by awarding attorney's fees and costs to the AOAO in amounts less than those requested. We therefore vacate the portions of the Court Order and the Judgment awarding attorney's fees and costs, and remand this case to the district court. See AOAO Discovery Bay, 134 
Hawai# i at 255, 339 P.3d at 1056. On remand, if the district 
court does not award attorney's fees and costs in the amounts requested by the AOAO, the district court should enter findings of fact and conclusions of law or otherwise explain why it is awarding attorney's fees and costs to the AOAO in less than the amounts requested, and why it disallowed specific amounts of attorney's fees or costs.
