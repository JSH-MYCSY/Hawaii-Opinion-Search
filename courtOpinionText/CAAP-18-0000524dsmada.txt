APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 17-1-0128)
ORDER GRANTING JULY 11, 2018 MOTION TO
DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Chan, JJ.)
Upon consideration of (1) Plaintiff-Appellee Robinson
Family Partners' (Robinson Family Partners) July 11, 2018 motion
to dismiss appellate court case number CAAP-18-0000524 for lack
of appellate jurisdiction, (2) the lack of any memorandum by
Defendants-Appellants Lance Kamuela Gomes (Gomes) and Punohu
Nalimu Kekaualua III (Kekaualua), pro se, in response to Robinson
Family Partners' July 11, 2018 motion, and (3) the record, it
appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction over Gomes and
Kekaualua's appeal from circuit court civil case number 17-1-
0218, because the circuit court has neither adjudicated the
claims in Robinson Family Partners' August 29, 2017 complaint norNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
entered an appealable final judgment.
An aggrieved party cannot obtain appellate review of a
circuit court's dispositive orders in a civil case pursuant to
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-1(a)(2016) until the circuit
court reduces the dispositive rulings to an appealable final
judgment as to all claims and parties pursuant to Rule 58 of the
Hawai#i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP).  See Jenkins v. Cades
Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai# i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334,
1338 (1994) ("An appeal may be taken from circuit court orders
resolving claims against parties only after the orders have been
reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor
of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP
[Rule] 58[.]").  "Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an
order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against
the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." 
Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai #i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177,
1186 (2008).  Consequently, "[a]n appeal from an order that is
not reduced to a judgment in favor or against the party by the
time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai# i at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote omitted). 
On August 27, 2018, the circuit court clerk filed the record on
appeal for appellate court case number CAAP-18-0000524, which
does not include an appealable final judgment.  Therefore, Gomes
and Kekaualua's appeal is premature, and we lack appellate
jurisdiction.
 Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Robinson Family
Partners' July 11, 2018 motion to dismiss appellate court case
number CAAP-18-0000524 is granted, and appellate court case
number CAAP-18-0000524 is dismissed for lack of appellate
jurisdiction.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, November 2, 2018.
