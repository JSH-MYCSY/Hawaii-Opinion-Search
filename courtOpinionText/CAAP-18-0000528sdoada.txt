APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
(CR. NO. 5CPC-17-0000190)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Chan, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Austin H. Rosa ( Rosa) appeals from
the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence ( Judgment) entered
against him and in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai#i
(State) on May 29, 2018, in the Circuit Court of the Fifth
Circuit (Circuit Court ).  On February 8, 2018, Rosa pleaded
guilty in 5CPC-17-0000190 to one count of Violation of a
Temporary Restraining Order ( TRO), in violation of Hawaii Revised1

Statutes ( HRS) § 586-4 (2018).   Rosa was sentenced to a one-year
term of imprisonment.2
Rosa raises two points of error on appeal, contending
that:  (1)  the classification of all forms of TRO violations as
misdemeanors is unconstitutional; and (2)  the Circuit Court
abused its discretion in imposing the maximum term of
imprisonment.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve Rosa's contentions as follows:
(1) HRS § 586-4(e) provides, inter alia , that a
knowing or intentional violation of a TRO is a misdemeanor.  See
also HRS § 586-11(a) (2018).  Rosa contends that HRS § 586-4
2HRS § 586-4 provides, in relevant part:
§ 586-4  Temporary restraining order.   (a)  Upon
petition to a family court judge, an ex parte temporary
restraining order may be granted without notice to restrain
either or both parties from contacting, threatening, or
physically abusing each other, notwithstanding that a
complaint for annulment, divorce, or separation has not been
filed.  The order may be granted to any person who, at the
time the order is granted, is a family or household member
as defined in section 586-1 or who filed a petition on
behalf of a family or household member.  The order shall
enjoin the respondent or person to be restrained from
performing any combination of the following acts:
(1)Contacting, threatening, or physically abusing
the protected party;
(2)Contacting, threatening, or physically abusing
any person residing at the protected party's
residence; or
(3)Entering or visiting the protected party's
residence.
. . . .
(e)  When a temporary restraining order is granted and
the respondent or person to be restrained knows of the
order, a knowing or intentional violation of the restraining
order is a misdemeanor[.]
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
violates the eighth amendment of the United States Constitution,
as well as article 1, section 12 of the Hawai#i Constitution,
because it disproportionately punishes "less severe" forms of TRO
violations, which amounts to cruel and unusual punishment.  More
specifically, Rosa argues that a violation consisting of "simply
making contact with a protected person" is "arguably benign
behavior" when compared to physical abuse or threatening
behavior.
The Hawai #i Supreme Court has held that "[t]he question
of what constitutes an adequate penalty necessary for the
prevention of crime is addressed to the sound judgment of the
legislature and the courts will not interfere with its exercise,
unless the punishment prescribed appears clearly and manifestly
to be cruel and unusual."  State v. Freitas, 61 Haw. 262, 267,
602 P.2d 914, 919 (1979), overruled on other grounds by State v.
Auld, 136 Hawai#i 244, 361 P.3d 471 (2015).
"[P]rominence is given to the power of the legislature to
define crimes and their punishment.  We concede the power in
most of its exercises.  We disclaim the right to assert a
judgment against that of the legislature, of the expediency
of the laws, or the right to oppose the judicial power to
the legislative power to define crimes and fix their
punishment, unless that power encounters in its exercise a
constitutional prohibition. . . .  The function of the
legislature is primary, its exercise fortified by
presumptions of right and legality, and is not to be
interfered with lightly, nor by any judicial conception of
its wisdom or propriety."
Id. at 267, 602 P.2d at 919-20 (citation omitted).
The supreme court has repeatedly stated:
The standard by which punishment is to be judged under
the "cruel and unusual" punishment provisions of both the
United States and Hawaii Constitutions is whether, in the
light of developing concepts of decency and fairness, the
prescribed punishment is so disproportionate to the conduct
proscribed and is of such duration as to shock the
conscience of reasonable persons or to outrage the moral
sense of the community.

State v. Solomon, 107 Hawai# i 117, 131, 111 P.3d 12, 26 (2005)
(citations, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted).  In
Solomon, the supreme court set forth a three-part test to
determine whether a punishment was "clearly and manifestly" cruel
and unusual: 
(1) the nature of the offense and/or the offender, with
particular regard to the degree of danger posed by both to
society; (2) the extent of the challenged penalty as
compared to the punishments prescribed for more serious
crimes within the same jurisdiction; and (3) the extent of
the challenged penalty as compared to the punishment
prescribed for the same offense in other jurisdictions.  
Id. at 132, 111 P.3d at 27 (citation omitted).  "In using this
test, the nature of the offense and the danger the offender poses
to society are the key factors in this determination."  Id.
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
Here, Rosa submits that multiple offenses involving
various forms of physical violence and threatening behavior are
classified as petty misdemeanors, pointing, as examples, to
Assault in the third degree, when committed in a fight or scuffle
entered into by mutual consent (HRS § 707-712 (2014)), and
Harassment (HRS § 711-1106 (2014)).  On this basis, Rosa argues
that classifying nonviolent or nonthreatening TRO violations as
misdemeanors is unconstitutional.  We conclude that Rosa's
argument is without merit.
As this court has previously explained:
The legislature enacted HRS Chapter 586 in 1982 "to
streamline the procedures for obtaining and issuing ex parte
temporary restraining orders to prevent acts of or the
recurrence of domestic abuse."  Hse. Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 1,
in 1982 House Journal, at 815; see also Hse. Stand. Comm.
Rep. No. 592, in 1982 House Journal, at 1165; Sen. Conf.
Comm. Rep. No. 4, in 1982 Senate Journal, at 873.  The
Senate Standing Committee Report found that a restraining
order serves "to cool violent relationships that have been
developing for a number of years" and that giving the court
"the discretion to extend protective orders" provides
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
"greater flexibility in trying to calm the emotionally
charged nature of such situations." Sen. Stand. Comm. Rep.
No. 643, in 1982 Senate Journal, at 1222.  Thus, the purpose
of the restraining order is to "prevent [ ] acts of abuse,
or a recurrence of actual domestic abuse, and assur[e] a
period of separation of the parties involved."  HRS § 586–4.
Later amendments to Chapter 586 sought "to better
protect the victims of domestic abuse."  Sen. Stand Comm.
Rep. No. 1444, in 1987 Senate Journal, at 1521.  The
legislature recognized "that many victims of domestic abuse
depend on protective orders to rescue them from violent
attacks and threats of abuse."  Hse. Stand. Comm. Rep. No.
549, in 1987 House Journal, at 1359.  
Coyle v. Compton, 85 Hawai#i 197, 205, 940 P.2d 404, 412 (App.
1997).
Subsequently, in Act 186 of 2000, the Legislature
stated:  "Domestic violence is a pervasive problem in Hawaii that
impacts not only victims, but family, friends, and others."  2000
Haw. Sess. Laws Act 186, § 1 at 380.  In 2008, in conjunction
with the additional statutory protections,  a Hawai# i Senate
report noted:3
According to the National Institute of Justice and the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one in four
women in the United States will experience domestic violence
during her lifetime.  In 2007, eighty-six per cent of the
legal assistance provided in Hawaii was for victims of
domestic violence.  Many victims of domestic violence obtain
a temporary restraining order or protective order against
the batterer.
S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 2693, in 2008 Senate Journal, at 1154.
In explaining certain increases to the mandatory
minimum jail time for TRO violations, a 2011 Hawai#i Senate
report stated:
The intent of your Committee is to enhance the
protection of victims of domestic violence by increasing
penalties for persons who violate temporary restraining
orders by sending a clear warning to these individuals that

any violation of a temporary restraining order will not be
tolerated with leniency.
S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 844, in 2011 Senate Journal, at 1142.4
Finally, as this court has previously observed, "the
plain and obvious purpose of the HRS § 586–4(d) misdemeanor is to
prevent violations of the TRO."  State v. Wise, 107 Hawai# i 67,
71, 109 P.3d 708, 712 (App. 2005).
The Hawai#i Legislature and the Hawai#i courts have
repeatedly recognized the serious danger posed to individual
victims and society by domestic abuse and the importance of
remedies to prevent the recurrence and escalation of the abuse. 
The Legislature's determination that treatment of all knowing or
intentional HRS § 586-4 TRO violations as misdemeanors, including
violations of the no-contact prohibition, is not disproportionate
to the proscribed conduct.  A one-year term of imprisonment for a
violation of a TRO is not "of such duration as to shock the
conscience of reasonable persons or to outrage the moral sense of
the community."  See Solomon, 107 Hawai# i at 131, 111 P.3d at 26. 
We conclude that the classification of knowing or intentional
nonviolent or nonthreatening TRO violations as misdemeanors is
constitutional, and we reject Rosa's first point of error.
(2)Rosa argues that, even if HRS § 586-4 is not
unconstitutional, the Circuit Court plainly abused its discretion
when it sentenced him to a one-year term of imprisonment, based
on the State's recommended sentence of "time served," the

Session of 2011 as H.B. 238.  2011 House Journal, at 42.  H.B. 238 was carried
over and adopted in the Regular Session of 2012.  2012 House Journal, at 738.

victim's written statement, and various aspects of the
Presentence Report.  Rosa has not made the transcript available
for the sentencing hearing in this case.  Thus, this court is
unable to review what was stated on the record before the Circuit
Court imposed the sentence, as well as the specific reasoning
stated by the court in imposing the sentence.  Upon careful
review of the record before us, and considering the mandate of
HRS § 706-606 (2014), we cannot conclude that the Circuit Court
abused its discretion in sentencing Rosa to imprisonment.
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's May 29, 2018
Judgment is affirmed.
