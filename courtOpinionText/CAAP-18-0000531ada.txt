APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
HONOLULU DIVISION 
(CIVIL NO. 1RC16-1-5579) 
MARCH 6, 2023 
HIRAOKA, PRESIDING JUDGE, AND WADSWORTH AND McCULLEN, JJ. 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY WADSWORTH, J. 
This appeal stems from a dispute between the owner of a 
condominium unit and the board of directors of the condominium 
project. In August 2016, Plaintiff-Appellee Sarah Pendleton, personally and as Trustee of the Sarah Pendleton Revocable Living Trust dated June 3, 1994 (Pendleton), sued Defendant-Appellant 
The Association of Apartment Owners of Kahala Towers aka Kahala 
Towers AOAO (AOAO) for the return of $600 in fines she had paid 
to AOAO earlier that year pursuant to an allegedly invalid and  
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
unenforceable fine policy. The District Court of the First 
Circuit, Honolulu Division (District Court) entered summary 
judgment in Pendleton's favor on her claim to recover the $600, 
and subsequently awarded her attorney's fees and costs of more than $16,000. 
AOAO appeals from the following judgment and orders of 
the District Court: 
(1) the June 12, 2018 Judgment; (2) the May 21, 2018 "Order Regarding Reduction in Attorney's Fees and Costs Awarded to [Pendleton]" (Order Awarding Reduced Fees); 
(3) the April 18, 2018 "Order Granting . . . 
Pendleton's Motion to Dismiss Without Prejudice Count III of the Complaint Filed August 22, 2016, Filed March 8, 2018" (Order Dismissing Count III
Without Prejudice); 
(4) the January 22, 2018 "Order Granting in Part 
and Denying in Part . . . Pendleton's Motion for Summary Judgment Filed September 8, 2017" (Order
Granting in Part Pendleton's MSJ); and 
(5) the November 25, 2016 "Order Denying . . . 
AOAO's Motion for Summary Judgment Filed October 14, 2016" (Order Denying AOAO's MSJ).
1/ 
AOAO contends that the District Court erred in several respects in granting summary judgment in favor of Pendleton on Count II of her complaint, in denying AOAO's motions for summary judgment, and in awarding Pendleton her attorney's fees and costs. 
We hold that: (1) the District Court properly 
exercised jurisdiction over Count II of the complaint, which did not seek declaratory relief, but, instead, sought damages from AOAO in the amount of $600, as well as an award of attorney's fees and costs; (2) Pendleton's claims in the District Court, by which she sought to recover fines paid to AOAO in 2016 pursuant to an allegedly invalid and unenforceable fine policy, were not

Honorable Hilary Benson Gangnes entered the Order Denying AOAO's MSJ and theOrder Dismissing Count III Without Prejudice.

barred by the doctrines of res judicata or collateral estoppel; 
(3) the District Court did not abuse its discretion in granting Pendleton's motion to dismiss Count III of the complaint without prejudice, after Count III became moot; and (4) the District Court did not err thereafter in striking the hearing on AOAO's motion for summary judgment on Count III, after the motion became moot.
 We further hold that the District Court did not abuse 
its discretion in awarding Pendleton attorney's fees under HRS § 514B-157. 
HRS § 514B-157(a) (2018) provides in relevant part 
that "if the claims upon which the association takes any action are not substantiated, all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by any such person or persons as a result of the action of the association, shall be promptly paid on demand to such person or persons by the association." Based on the plain meaning of the phrase "any action" in HRS § 514B-157(a), as well as its context and purpose, we construe the phrase to mean "any action" taken by the association on its applicable claims — not just court action. Here, AOAO assessed and collected from Pendleton $600 in fines pursuant to its fine policy, i.e., AOAO took actions on a claim that it had a right to assess and collect such fines under that policy. In light of the District Court's determination that the fine policy did not comply with HRS § 514B-104(a)(l1), AOAO's claim was "not substantiated[,]" and Pendleton was properly awarded fees pursuant to HRS § 514B-157(a). 
Accordingly, we affirm the challenged judgment and 
orders. 
I. Background 
Kahala Towers is a condominium project located at 4300 
Waialae Avenue in Honolulu. Pendleton owns a penthouse unit in the project (Apartment or Unit). 
A. Prior Circuit Court Case 
On September 15, 2010, Pendleton sued AOAO in the 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court) for injunctive 
3 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
relief and damages (
Circuit Court Case).  Her complaint alleged 
that AOAO had interfered with her use of rooftop space adjacent 
to her Unit, as follows: 
6. The [U]nit purchased by . . . Pendleton was built
and sold as a unit with a private rooftop deck. 
7. The AOAO wrongfully ordered . . . Pendleton to
remove her personal belonging from the limited common areas
adjacent to the [U]nit. 
8. The AOAO and other Defendants removed walls, a
locked door and grill that provided security for the [U]nit. 
9. The AOAO has left incomplete repairs to the roof
surface adjacent to the [U]nit rendering the deck surfaceunusable and subject to leaking. 
. . . . 
13. The AOAO and other Defendants in their actions 
towards . . . Pendleton have violated Pendleton's right toquiet enjoyment of her property. 
14. The AOAO and other Defendants have instituted a 
program of harassment against . . . Pendleton and singledher out for abuse and oppression. 
15. The AOAO has wrongfully restricted . . .
Pendleton's use of the property adjacent to her [U]nit. 
Pendleton sought a variety of injunctive relief and 
damages, including the following: 
1. The AOAO be restrained and enjoined from any
further action that would have the effect of reducingsecurity for . . . Pendleton's [U]nit; 
2. The AOAO and other Defendants be restrained and 
enjoined from allowing the roof repair adjacent to . . .Pendleton's [U]nit to remain uncompleted. 
. . . . 
4. The AOAO and other Defendants be ordered to 
rebuild the structures and security measures torn down anddestroyed that provided security and privacy to Pendleton's[U]nit; 
5. Alternatively, that comparable or higher security
and privacy be afforded Pendleton's [U]nit at Defendants'cost; 
6.
 The AOAO be restrained and enjoined from harassing
. . . Pendleton; 
. . . . 
10. That Pendleton be awarded compensatory damages in
an amount to be determined; 
11. That Pendleton be awarded attorney's fees, costs
and other such relief as this Court deems just and proper. 
4 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 It appears that as part of her alleged damages, Pendleton sought 
reimbursement of a City and County of Honolulu-imposed cost for obtaining a variance for an allegedly non-code-compliant door that led from her Unit to the rooftop space. 
On July 29, 2014, the Circuit Court entered findings of 
fact, conclusions of law, and an order granting AOAO's motion for summary judgment on Pendleton's complaint. 
The conclusions of 
law included the following: 
18. Neither the [Kahala Towers' Restated Declaration
of Condominium Project Regime] nor the [Restated By-Laws of
Association of Apartment Owners of Kahala Towers] designatethe roof adjacent to the Apartment as a limited commonelement. 
19. The roof adjacent to the Apartment is not a
limited common element. 
20. The installation of a door in the Apartment,
either by Pendleton or a prior owner, adjacent to the roofarea, without the Association's consent or approval, did notconvert the roof area into a limited common element. 
. . . . 
24. Paragraph 4, page 4 of the [c]omplaint requests
that the Association be "ordered to rebuild the structures and security measures torn down and destroyed that providedsecurity and privacy to Pendleton's unit . . . ." 
Pendleton 
is referring to a four-foot wall and a locked door and grillthat used to be outside an unpermitted door or window of herApartment. Because the wall and "locked door" were not partof limited common elements appurtenant to the Apartment, theCourt lacks the record and legal authority to compel theAssociation to rebuild those structures and, therefore,Pendleton's request for a mandatory injunction is denied. 
. . . . 
40. Pendleton seeks compensation for a lawfully
imposed cost by the City and County to bring her Apartmentup to code. 
She seeks these damages based on an anonymous
complaint. Because these costs were imposed by the City andCounty, Pendleton cannot recover them from the Association. 
(Internal record citations omitted.) 
On October 27, 2014, the Circuit Court entered final 
judgment in AOAO's favor and against Pendleton on all claims in 
her complaint. 
B. Underlying District Court Case 
In December 2015, AOAO's property management company 
notified Pendleton's counsel that Pendleton would be fined if the
door in her Apartment adjacent to the roof area were not removed  
5   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and replaced with a louvered window. In the ensuing weeks, AOAO 
repeatedly assessed fines to Pendleton's account pursuant to AOAO's Fines Enforcement Policy (Fine Policy), purportedly 
adopted on December 21, 2009. In early February 2016, Pendleton 
paid a total of $600 in fines to AOAO under protest. 
On August 22, 2016, Pendleton filed a three-count 
complaint against AOAO in the District Court (Complaint), 
initiating the case underlying this appeal. Count I alleged 
facts regarding the fine dispute between AOAO and Pendleton but asserted no discernible claim for relief. Count II alleged in relevant part: 
24. . . . [AOAO] adopted the "RESOLUTION ADOPTING A
FINES ENFORCEMENT POLICY," . . . on or about December 21,
2009 (hereinafter, "Fine Policy"). 
25. The Fine Policy does not contain any language
providing that if the fine is paid, the unit owner shallhave the right to initiate a dispute resolution process asprovided by [Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) §§] 514B-161,
514B-162. 
26. [AOAO]'s Fine Policy does not meet the
requirements of HRS 514B-104(a)(11)
2/ and is, therefore, not
valid or enforceable. 
2/ HRS § 514B-104(a)(11) (2018) provides: 
Association; powers.  (a) Except as provided in
section 514B-105, and subject to the provisions of thedeclaration and bylaws, the association, even ifunincorporated, may: 
. . . . 
(11) Impose charges and penalties, including late
fees and interest, for late payment ofassessments and levy reasonable fines forviolations of the declaration, bylaws, rules,and regulations of the association, either inaccordance with the bylaws or, if the bylaws aresilent, 
pursuant to a resolution adopted by the
board that establishes a fining procedure thatstates the basis for the fine and allows an appeal to the board of the fine with notice andan opportunity to be heard and providing that ifthe fine is paid, the unit owner shall have theright to initiate a dispute resolution processas provided by sections 514B-161, 514B-162, orby filing a request for an administrativehearing under a pilot program administered bythe department of commerce and consumeraffairs[.] 
(Emphasis added.) 
6 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
  27. [AOAO]'s collection of fines against [Pendleton]
pursuant to the Fine Policy, including fines related to the
window/door of $600, were wrongful and illegal. 
28. [Pendleton] has been damaged in an amount within
the jurisdiction of this Court. 
(Footnote added.) Count III alleged in part: 
35. [AOAO] has assessed increasing fines against
[Pendleton]. 
36. In levying fines against [Pendleton] without any
basis, [AOAO] has violated its obligation of good faith,violated the Declaration and Bylaws of the Association ofApartment Owners of Kahala Towers, and has wronged[Pendleton]. 
37. Pendleton has been damaged by [AOAO]'s actions. 
The Complaint sought judgment against AOAO for "all 
fines paid" in the amount of $600, and an award of attorney's 
fees and costs. 
On October 14, 2016, AOAO filed a motion for summary 
judgment (AOAO's MSJ). AOAO argued that: (1) the doctrines of 
res judicata and collateral estoppel barred the Complaint; (2) 
the court lacked jurisdiction to issue declaratory rulings; and (3) Pendleton's claim for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing failed as a matter of law, because there was no contract between Pendleton and AOAO. On October 19, 2016, Pendleton filed a memorandum opposing AOAO's MSJ. On November 25, 2016, the District Court entered the Order Denying AOAO's MSJ. 
On September 8, 2017, Pendleton filed a motion for 
summary judgment (Pendleton's MSJ).  Pendleton argued in part 
that AOAO's Fine Policy did not comply with HRS § 514B-104(a)(11) 
because it did not contain any provision for an apartment owner to initiate mediation or arbitration after payment of a fine. On September 27, 2017, AOAO filed a memorandum opposing Pendleton's MSJ. AOAO contended in part that Pendleton's argument was "hypertechnical[,]" and that deeming the Fine Policy invalid because it did not explicitly mention a unit owner's rights to arbitration or mediation, when Pendleton had in fact demanded mediation, would lead to an absurd or unjust result. 
7 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 On January 22, 2018, the District Court entered the 
Order Granting in Part Pendleton's MSJ. 
The court ruled in 
relevant part: 
As to [Pendleton]'s claims regarding HRS Section 514B-
104(a) in Count II of the Complaint, there are no questions
of fact and [Pendleton] is entitled to a judgment as amatter of law. 
As to [Pendleton]'s claims [in Count III of the
Complaint] regarding the breach of the obligation ofgood faith and fair dealing, there are questions offact that preclude summary judgment on this cause ofaction[.] 
The District Court granted Pendleton's MSJ "as to [Pendleton's 
claim for $600[,]" and ordered that Pendleton "shall submit her motion for attorney's fees and costs . . . ." Accordingly, the District Court granted Pendleton's MSJ as to Count II seeking recovery of the $600 fine paid by Pendleton to AOAO, because AOAO's Fine Policy did not meet the requirements of HRS § 514B-104(a)(11). 
On March 8, 2018, Pendleton filed a motion to dismiss 
Count III without prejudice, pursuant to District Court Rules of Civil Procedure (DCRCP) Rule 41(a)(2). She argued that Count III 
was moot, because the District Court "has already determined that 
the $600 claimed by . . . Pendleton should be awarded to her pursuant to Count II of the Complaint." 
On April 2, 2018, AOAO filed a motion for summary 
judgment on Count III (AOAO's MSJ on Count III). AOAO argued 
that: (1) Count III was moot, as conceded by Pendleton; and (2) 
because there was no contract between Pendleton and AOAO, her claim for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing failed as a matter of law. On April 4, 2018, AOAO filed a memorandum in opposition to Pendleton's motion to dismiss Count III without prejudice, arguing that Count III should be dismissed with prejudice. 
On April 9, 2018, the District Court heard Pendleton's 
motion to dismiss Count III without prejudice. Following oral argument by the parties, the court granted Pendleton's motion and struck the hearing on AOAO's MSJ on Count III as moot. On April 18, 2018, the District Court entered the Order Dismissing 
8  
 
  
  
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Count III Without Prejudice. 
On April 27, 2018, Pendleton submitted a motion for 
attorney's fees and costs. The motion sought attorney's fees and 
costs in the total amount of $20,823.39, pursuant to HRS § 514B-157(a)
3/ and DCRCP Rule 54. 
On May 21, 2018, the District Court entered the Order 
Awarding Reduced Fees. Pendleton was awarded attorney's fees in the amount of $16,109.94 under HRS § 514B-157 and costs in the amount of $65.81. 
II. Points of Error 
AOAO raises five points of error on appeal,
4/ contending 
that: (1) the District Court lacked jurisdiction to issue "declaratory rulings" on Count II of the Complaint; (2) the District Court erred in denying AOAO's MSJ based on the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel; (3) the District Court abused its discretion in granting Pendleton's motion to dismiss Count III of the Complaint without prejudice;
5/ (4) the District 
Court erred in denying AOAO's MSJ on Count III, because HRS Chapter 514B does not permit a private right of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and (5) the District Court erred in awarding Pendleton attorney's fees and costs under HRS § 514B-157. 
III. Standards of Review 
A. Jurisdiction 
"The existence of jurisdiction is a question of law
that we review de novo under the right/wrong standard.
Questions regarding subject matter jurisdiction may be 
3/ HRS § 514B-157 is quoted in its entirety and discussed, infra. 
4/ AOAO's points of error do not comply with HRAP Rule 28(b)(4). In 
particular, the points of error do not state where in the record the allegederror was objected to or the manner in which the alleged error was brought tothe attention of the District Court. Additionally, AOAO's points of errorhave been reordered for organizational clarity. 
5/ AOAO's related point of error refers to AOAO's "Motion to Dismiss
Count III of the Complaint." It does not appear, however, that AOAO filed amotion to dismiss Count III. AOAO's related argument appears to challenge theOrder Dismissing Count III Without Prejudice, which granted Pendleton's motionto dismiss Count III without prejudice.

C. Res Judicata and Collateral Estoppel 
Application of the doctrines of res judicata or 
collateral estoppel is a question of law. Questions of law are 
reviewed de novo under the right/wrong standard. See PennyMac

DCRCP Rule 41(a)(2) provides in relevant part that 
"[e]xcept [by stipulation], an action shall not be dismissed at 
the plaintiff's instance save upon order of the court and upon such terms and conditions as the court deems proper." The rule thus "vests in the trial court the discretion to deny the motion or grant it upon 'such terms and conditions as the court deems proper.'" Sapp v. Wong, 3 Haw. App. 509, 512, 654 P.2d 883, 885

E. Attorney's Fees 
An appellate court reviews a trial court's grant or 
denial of attorney's fees and costs under the abuse of discretion 
standard. See Gailliard v. Rawsthorne, 150 Hawai# i 169, 175, 498 
P.3d 700, 706 (2021). "An abuse of discretion occurs where the trial court has clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant." Oahu Publ'ns, Inc.

F. Statutory Interpretation 
"The interpretation of a statute is a question of law 
reviewable de novo." American Savings Bank, F.S.B. v. Chan, 146 
Hawai# i 94, 102, 456 P.3d 167, 175 (2020). 
When construing a statute, our foremost obligation is to
ascertain and give effect to the intention of thelegislature, which is to be obtained primarily from thelanguage contained in the statute itself. And we must read statutory language in the context of the entire statute andconstrue it in a manner consistent with its purpose. 
Id. (quoting Ka Pa# akai O Ka# aina v. Land Use Comm'n, 94 Hawai #i 
31, 41, 7 P.3d 1068, 1078 (2000)). 
IV. Discussion 
A. Jurisdiction Over Count II 
AOAO contends that Count II of Pendleton's Complaint 
sought declaratory relief, and pursuant to HRS § 632-1(a) 
(2016),6/ "declaratory relief may not be obtained in any district 
6/ HRS § 632-1(a) provides: 
§ 632-1 Jurisdiction; controversies subject to.  (a)
In cases of actual controversy, courts of record, within the
scope of their respective jurisdictions, shall have power tomake binding adjudications of right, whether or notconsequential relief is, or at the time could be, claimed,and no action or proceeding shall be open to objection onthe ground that a judgment or order merely declaratory ofright is prayed for; provided that declaratory relief maynot be obtained in any district court, or in any controversy
(continued...) 
11 (...continued)FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
court[.]" AOAO argues that declaratory relief includes 
"controversies involving the interpretation of . . . other instruments of writing" and "[t]he only way the [D]istrict [C]ourt could agree with Pendleton and invalidate the Fine Enforcement Policy was to resolve a controversy over the interpretation of a writing[.]" 
AOAO's argument lacks merit. Count II of the Complaint 
alleged that AOAO's Fine Policy did not meet the requirements of HRS 514B-104(a)(11), the AOAO's collection of $600 in fines from Pendleton was thus illegal, and Pendleton incurred resulting damages. Neither Count II nor the prayer of the Complaint sought declaratory relief. Rather, the prayer sought judgment against AOAO for "all fines paid" in the amount of $600, and an award of attorney's fees and costs. 
Accordingly, the District Court properly exercised 
jurisdiction over Count II and did not err on that basis in entering the Order Granting in Part Pendleton's MSJ. 
B. Res Judicata and Collateral Estoppel 
AOAO contends that Pendleton's claims in the District 
Court were barred by res judicata and collateral estoppel. AOAO 
appears to argue that Pendleton is trying to re-litigate "[her] contention that the door was an appropriate alteration of the Apartment" – an issue that was litigated or could have been litigated in the prior Circuit Court Case. 
Res judicata , or claim preclusion, and collateral 
estoppel, or issue preclusion, are legal doctrines that limit a party to one opportunity to litigate aspects of a case, in order to prevent inconsistent results among multiple suits and to promote finality and judicial economy. See Bremer v. Weeks, 104 
with respect to taxes, or in any case where a divorce or
annulment of marriage is sought. Controversies involvingthe interpretation of deeds, wills, other instruments ofwriting, statutes, municipal ordinances, and othergovernmental regulations may be so determined, and thisenumeration does not exclude other instances of actual antagonistic assertion and denial of right. 
(Emphasis added.) 
12 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawai
#i 43, 53, 85 P.3d 150, 160 (2004). Claim preclusion 
"prohibits a party from relitigating a previously adjudicated 
cause of action." Id. (quoting Dorrance v. Lee, 90 Hawai# i 143, 
148, 976 P.2d 904, 909 (1999)). The party asserting claim preclusion has the burden of establishing that: 
(1) there was a 
final judgment on the merits; (2) the parties to the action in question are the same or in privity with the parties in the original suit; and (3) the claim decided in the original suit is identical to the one presented in the action in question. Id. at 
54, 85 P.3d at 161. 
Issue preclusion "applies to a subsequent suit between 
the parties or their privies on a different
 cause of action and 
prevents the parties or their privies from relitigating any issue that was actually litigated and finally decided in the earlier action." Id. (quoting Dorrance, 90 Hawai# i at 148, 976 P.2d at 
910). The party asserting issue preclusion must establish that: (1)
 there was a final judgment on the merits; (2) the party 
against whom issue preclusion is asserted was a party or in privity with a party to the original suit; (3) the issue decided in the original suit is identical to the one presented in the action in question; and (4) the issue decided in the original suit was essential to the final judgment. Id. (quoting 
Dorrance, 
90 Hawai# i at 149, 976 P.2d at 911). 
Here, as to AOAO's claim preclusion defense, there is 
no dispute that there was a final judgment on the merits in the prior Circuit Court Case, and the parties in that case and the present case are the same. The issue is whether the claims decided in the Circuit Court Case are identical to those raised in the present case. We conclude they are not. 
In the prior Circuit Court Case, the complaint alleged 
that AOAO had interfered with Pendleton's use of the rooftop area adjacent to her Apartment by ordering her to remove her belongings; by removing walls, a locked gate, and a grill that provided security for the unit; and by making incomplete repairs to the roof that had rendered the deck surface unusable. Pendleton sought a variety of injunctive relief, including that AOAO be restrained from taking any further action that would 
13  
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
reduce the security of her Apartment, be enjoined from allowing 
the roof repair to remain uncompleted, and be ordered to rebuild the structures and security measures that had been removed or to afford her unit with "comparable or higher security and privacy." Pendleton also sought monetary damages. 
In awarding AOAO summary judgment in 2014, the Circuit 
Court concluded that the rooftop area was not a limited common element appurtenant to Pendleton's Apartment; the installation of the door in the Apartment adjacent to the roof area, without AOAO's consent or approval, did not convert the roof area into a limited common element; and Pendleton was not entitled to the requested injunctive relief or monetary damages. 
In contrast, the present case relates to AOAO's 
assessment and collection of fines from Pendleton – more than a year after entry of judgment in the Circuit Court Case – pursuant to the allegedly defective Fine Policy. In her Complaint, Pendleton did not seek declaratory relief, and she did not seek damages based on the claims presented or decided in the prior Circuit Court Case. Rather, in the present case, Pendleton sought to recover the $600 in fines she had paid to AOAO in 2016 pursuant to the Fine Policy. Pendleton's claim to recover those monies not only was not litigated, but could not have been litigated, in the Circuit Court Case, which ended in 2014. 
Because the claims decided in the Circuit Court Case 
are not identical to those presented in the present case, claim preclusion did not bar those claims, and the District Court did not err in denying AOAO's MSJ based on claim preclusion. 
As to AOAO's issue preclusion defense, AOAO similarly 
failed to show that any issue decided in the Circuit Court Case was identical to one presented in the present action. Accordingly, the District Court did not err in denying AOAO's MSJ based on issue preclusion.

7/ In the opening brief, in the middle of its res judicata/collateral
estoppel argument, AOAO also appears to argue that the Fine Policy complied
with HRS § 514B-104(a)(11). Because this argument is not the subject of anyof AOAO's identified points of error, it is disregarded. See HRAP Rule 
28(b)(4). In any event, the District Court did not err in concluding that theFine Policy, which indisputably failed to "provid[e] that if the fine is paid,

7/ (...continued)C. Dismissal of Count III Without Prejudice 
AOAO contends that the District Court abused its 
discretion in granting Pendleton's motion to dismiss Count III of 
the Complaint without prejudice pursuant to DCRCP Rule 41(a)(2). AOAO argues that the sole purpose of Pendleton's motion was to avoid a potential adverse ruling so as to preserve a claim for attorney's fees against AOAO. 
The record does not support AOAO's argument. In the 
Order Granting in Part Pendleton's MSJ, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of Pendleton on Count II of the Complaint, which sought judgment in the amount of $600 for the fines she had paid to AOAO pursuant to the defective Fine Policy. Thereafter, Pendleton moved under DCRCP Rule 41(a)(2) to dismiss Count III of the Complaint, which sought the same $600 sum under an alternative legal theory, without prejudice, on the ground that Count III was now moot. 
Although AOAO subsequently filed 
its MSJ on Count III, that motion was not pending when Pendleton filed her motion to dismiss Count III without prejudice. AOAO thus provided no support for its assertion below (and on appeal) that the sole purpose of Pendleton's motion was to avoid a potential adverse ruling so as to preserve a claim for attorney's fees. 
AOAO did not otherwise show that it would suffer some 
"plain legal prejudice" as a result of the dismissal of Count III without prejudice. Smith v. Lenches, 263 F.3d 972, 976 (9th Cir. 
2001) (construing analogous federal rule). Accordingly, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in granting Pendleton's motion to dismiss Count III without prejudice.

D. Denial of Motion for Summary Judgment on Count III 
AOAO contends that the District Court erred in denying 
AOAO's MSJ on Count III, because HRS Chapter 514B8/ does not 
permit a private right of action for breach of the implied 
covenant of good faith and fair dealing.9/ 
However, the District Court did not explicitly deny 
AOAO's MSJ on Count III. Rather, after granting Pendleton's motion to dismiss Count III without prejudice, the District Court struck the hearing on AOAO's MSJ on Count III as moot. Indeed, the latter motion was moot, and AOAO does not argue otherwise. To the extent that AOAO challenges the District Court's Order Dismissing Count III Without Prejudice, that argument is addressed above in section C. 
Furthermore, AOAO does not indicate how and where it 
raised the argument that HRS Chapter 514B does not permit a private right of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. See HRAP Rule 28(b)(4), (7). In 
AOAO's MSJ on Count III, AOAO summarily argued that there was no contract between Pendleton and AOAO, and her claim for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing thus failed as a matter of law.
10/ AOAO's MSJ on Count III did not include any argument 
8/   HRS § 514B-9 (2018) provides: 
Obligation of good faith . Every contract or duty
governed by this chapter imposes an obligation of good faith
in its performance or enforcement. 
9/   AOAO filed two motions for summary judgment that addressed Count
III – AOAO's MSJ, filed on October 14, 2016, and AOAO's MSJ on Count III,filed on April 2, 2018. The Order Denying AOAO's MSJ, filed on November 25,2016, denied the motion and ordered the parties to engage in mediation. AOAOmakes no discernible argument challenging that ruling in its opening brief; 
any such argument is thus deemed waived. See HRAP Rule 28(b)(7). Instead,
AOAO argues that the District Court wrongly denied its later MSJ on Count III"without comment." 
10/ AOAO argues on appeal that the Declaration and Bylaws of the
Association of Apartment Owners of Kahala Towers did not create a contractualrelationship between Pendleton and AOAO. Because this argument is not thesubject of any of AOAO's identified points of error, it is disregarded. See 
HRAP Rule 28(b)(4). In any event, the supreme court has recognized that"[g]enerally, the declaration and bylaws of a condominium serve as a contractbetween the condominium owners and the association, establishing the rulesgoverning the condominium." Harrison v. Casa De Emdeko, Inc., 142 Hawai #i

regarding a private right of action. The issue is thus deemed 
waived. See Cnty. of Hawaii v. C & J Coupe Family Ltd. P'ship,

28(b)(4)(iii). 
E. Attorney's Fees and Costs 
AOAO contends that the District Court wrongly awarded 
attorney's fees and costs to Pendleton pursuant to HRS 
§ 514B-157. 
During the relevant period, HRS § 514B-157 provided: 
Attorneys' fees, delinquent assessments, and expenses
of enforcement. (a) All costs and expenses, including
reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by or on behalf of the
association for: 
(1) Collecting any delinquent assessments againstany owner's unit; 
(2) Foreclosing any lien thereon; or 
(3) Enforcing any provision of the declaration,bylaws, house rules, and this chapter, or therules of the real estate commission; 
against an owner, occupant, tenant, employee of an owner, orany other person who may in any manner use the property,shall be promptly paid on demand to the association by suchperson or persons; provided that if the claims upon whichthe association takes any action are not substantiated, allcosts and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees,incurred by any such person or persons as a result of theaction of the association, shall be promptly paid on demandto such person or persons by the association. 
(b) If any claim by an owner is substantiated in any
action against an association, any of its officers ordirectors, or its board to enforce any provision of thedeclaration, bylaws, house rules, or this chapter, then allreasonable and necessary expenses, costs, and attorneys'fees incurred by an owner shall be awarded to such owner;provided that no such award shall be made in any derivativeaction unless: 
(1) The owner first shall have demanded and allowed reasonable time for the board to pursue suchenforcement; or

(2) The owner demonstrates to the satisfaction of 
the court that a demand for enforcement made to the board would have been fruitless. 
If any claim by an owner is not substantiated in any courtaction against an association, any of its officers ordirectors, or its board to enforce any provision of thedeclaration, bylaws, house rules, or this chapter, then allreasonable and necessary expenses, costs, and attorneys'fees incurred by an association shall be awarded to theassociation, unless before filing the action in court theowner has first submitted the claim to mediation, or toarbitration under subpart D, and made a good faith effort toresolve the dispute under any of those procedures. 
Further, HRS § 514B-10(a) states in part: 
Remedies to be liberally administered . (a) The 
remedies provided by this chapter shall be liberallyadministered to the end that the aggrieved party is put inas good a position as if the other party had fullyperformed. 
Pendleton sought attorney's fees and costs pursuant to 
HRS § 514B-157(a) and DCRCP Rule 54. The District Court awarded 
Pendleton reduced attorney's fees under HRS § 514B-157 without specifying the applicable subsection. The court also awarded Pendleton her costs.
  11/
On appeal, AOAO argues in part that HRS § 514B-157(b) 
"applies to a 'claim by an owner . . . in any action against an association[,]'" and because Pendleton sought only monetary damages in her Complaint, and not to enforce any provision of AOAO's declarations, by-laws, or house rules, any claim for attorney's fees by Pendleton under subsection (b) was foreclosed by the supreme court's decision in Schmidt v. Bd. of Dirs. of the Ass'n of Apt. Owners of the Marco Polo Apts., 73 Haw. 526, 836 P.2d 479 (1992).
12/ 
11/ The District Court did not state whether it awarded costs under 
HRS § 514B-157(a) or DCRCP Rule 54. 
12/ In Schmidt, the owners of a condominium, the Schmidts, had sued
the association, alleging that it breached its duty, pursuant to the
declaration and by-laws of the association, to maintain the common areas,resulting in water leakage that caused damage to the Schmidts' unit. 73 Haw. at 528, 836 P.2d at 481. The supreme court held that the Schmidts, whoprevailed at trial, were not entitled to attorney's fees under HRS§ 514A–94(b), the predecessor to HRS § 514B-157(b) (see infra). Id. at 533,
836 P.2d at 483. The court reasoned: 
[T]he Schmidts did not seek to enforce any affirmative 
action on the part of the [a]ssociation to comply with anyprovision of the [a]ssociation's declaration, by-laws, house
(continued...) 
18 12/ (...continued)FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 Pendleton does not dispute AOAO's argument regarding 
HRS § 514B-157(b). 
Rather, she contends that the District Court 
properly awarded her fees and costs under HRS § 514B-157(a), as 
follows: 
The plain language of [HRS § 514B-157(a)] states that it
applies when the claims upon which the association takes any
action  are not substantiated. Here, [AOAO] fined Pendleton
claiming that it had authority to levy fines. Since the District Court determined that [AOAO] had not complied withthe statutory prerequisites to impose a fine, theassociation's claim was not substantiated, so Pendleton isentitled to "all costs and expenses, including reasonableattorneys' fees, incurred" by Pendleton "as a result of theaction of the association." 
(Ellipses omitted.) 
Indeed, HRS § 514B-157(a) states in relevant part that 
"if the claims upon which the association takes any action are 
not substantiated, all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by any such person or persons as a result of the action of the association, shall be promptly paid on demand to such person or persons by the association." (Emphasis added.) AOAO argues, however, that HRS § 514B-157(a) cannot support the fee award to Pendleton because AOAO "did not assert 'claims' against Pendleton, and did not file an 'action' against [her.]" 
The terms "claims" and "action" are not defined in HRS 
§ 514B-157. We thus turn to familiar principles of statutory construction: 
rules, or HRS chapter 514A; rather, in their own words, they
were "seeking damages for the [a]ssociation's failure tocomply with the By–Laws and Declaration." 
. . . In the 
absence of any prayer for equitable, mandatory, orinjunctive relief to compel obedience to the [a]ssociation'sdeclaration, by-laws, house rules, or any enumeratedprovision of HRS chapter 514A, HRS § 514A-94(b) does notapply to the Schmidts' actions.

Webster's defines a "claim" to include "a demand for 
something as due; an assertion of a right or an alleged right[.]" 
Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary 379 (1996 ed.); see also Black's Law Dictionary 311 (11th ed. 2019) (defining "claim" to include "[t]he assertion of an existing right" and "[a] demand for money, property, or a legal remedy to which one asserts a right"). The ordinary meaning of "claim" is broad enough to encompass AOAO's assertion of a right to assess and collect fines from Pendleton pursuant to the Fine Policy. 
Webster's and Black's also provide multiple definitions 
of "action." See Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary at 
20; Black's Law Dictionary at 37. Black's, for example, defines "action" as "[t]he process of doing something; conduct or behavior[,]" "[a] thing done[,]" or "[a] civil or criminal judicial proceeding." Black's Law Dictionary at 37. 
To the extent there is ambiguity in the term "action," 
we may examine the context in which it appears. See Castro v. 
Melchor, 142 Hawai# i 1, 11, 414 P.3d 53, 63 (2018) ("In 
construing an ambiguous statute, the meaning of the ambiguous words may be sought by examining the context, with which the ambiguous words, phrases, and sentences may be compared, in order to ascertain their true meaning." (quoting Lingle v. Hawai# i 
Gov't Emp. Ass'n, AFSCME, Local 152, AFL-CIO, 107 Hawai# i 178, 
183, 111 P.3d 587, 592 (2005))). We may also examine HRS § 514B-157(a) in the context of HRS § 514B-157(b). See Omiya
, 
142 Hawai# i at 449–50, 420 P.3d at 380–81 ("'[L]aws in pari 
materia, or upon the same subject matter, shall be construed with reference to each other. What is clear in one statute may be 
20 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
called upon in aid to explain what is doubtful in another.'" 
(quoting 
State v. Kamana# o, 118 Hawai# i 210, 218, 188 P.3d 724, 
732 (2008))); see also HRS § 1-16 (2009). 
The language at issue in HRS § 514B-157(a) refers 
broadly to "the claims upon which the association takes any action" (emphasis added), i.e., without imposing any limitation upon the type of "action" taken. In addition, where the claims upon which the association takes any action are not substantiated, all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by, for example, a unit owner, "shall be promptly paid on demand to such person or persons by the association." HRS § 514B-157(a) (emphasis added). The unit owner is not required under this provision to seek an award of costs and fees in a court action filed by the association (or by the unit owner). 
In contrast, HRS § 514B-157(b) concludes with the 
sentence, "If any claim by an owner is not substantiated in any court action against an association . . . to enforce any provision of the declaration, bylaws, house rules, or this chapter, then all reasonable and necessary expenses, costs, and attorneys' fees incurred by an association shall be awarded to the association, unless before filing the action in court, the owner . . . ." (Emphasis added.) We must presume that the phrases "any action" and "any court action" were intended to have different meanings. See Trs. of Estate of Bishop v. Au, 146 
Hawai# i 272, 280, 463 P.3d 929, 937 (2020) ("When the legislature 
uses different words in a statute . . . the different words are presumed to have different meanings." (citing Agustin v. Dan Ostrow Constr. Co., 64 Haw. 80, 83, 636 P.2d 1348, 1351 (1981))). We must also presume that, had the legislature intended to limit the type of action that can trigger the provisions of HRS § 514B-157(a) to "any court action," it would have done so. See, 
e.g., Lanai Co. v. Land Use Comm'n, 105 Hawai# i 296, 318, 97 P.3d 
372, 394 (2004) ("If the legislature intended to grant the LUC enforcement powers, it could have expressly provided the LUC with such power."); Morgan v. Plan. Dep't, Cnty. of Kaua# i, 104 Hawai# i 
173, 179, 86 P.3d 982, 988 (2004) (ruling that if the legislature 
21  
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
had intended to grant the commission injunctive powers, it would 
have done so expressly). The context of the term "action" in HRS § 514B-157(a) thus supports the argument that the term means "any action" taken by the association on its applicable claims – not just court action. 
The legislative history of HRS § 514B-157(a) does not 
reflect otherwise. In Vinson v. Ass'n of Apt. Owners of Sands of Kahana, 130 Hawai# i 540, 312 P.3d 1247 (App. 2013), we explained: 
The Legislature enacted HRS § 514B–157 in 2004 as part of a
comprehensive recodification of Hawaii's "CondominiumProperty Regime" Law (which prior to 1988 was referred to as"Horizontal Property Regimes"). See 2004 Haw. Sess. Laws 
Act 164, §§ 1 at 755, 2 at 795–96; 1988 Haw. Sess. Laws Act65, § 1 at 98. The predecessor to HRS § 514B–157 is HRS §514A–94 (Supp. 1977), which in turn was preceded by HRS §514–7.5 (1976). See 1977 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 98, § 2 at
180–81; 1976 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 239, § 1 at 757–58. The statute has been amended over time, including the adoptionof subsection (b) in 1983. See 1983 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 
137, § 1 at 250. 
Id. at 548 n.5, 312 P.3d at 1255 n.5. 
Thus, the earliest predecessor of HRS § 514B–157(a) was 
HRS § 514–7.5 (1976), which originated as part of Act 239.13/ The 
13/ Act 239 amended HRS Chapter 514 by adding the following new section,
among others: 
Sec. 514- Attorney's fees and expenses of
enforcement. All costs and expenses, including reasonableattorney's fees, incurred by or on behalf of the associationfor: 
(1) Collecting any delinquent assessments againstany owner's apartment; 
(2) Foreclosing any lien thereon; 
(3) Enforcing any provision of the declaration,bylaws, house rules, and the Horizontal PropertyAct; or 
(4) The rules and regulations of the real estatecommission; against an owner or any occupant ofan apartment shall be promptly paid on demand tothe association by the apartment owner; providedthat if the claims upon which the associationtakes any action are not substantiated, allcosts and expenses, including reasonableattorney's fees, incurred by the apartment owneras a result of the action of the association,shall be promptly paid on demand to theapartment owner by the association. 
1976 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 239, § 1 at 757-58. 
22 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
  Senate Committee on Judiciary described the purpose of the new 
section as follows: 
[to] authorize condominium associations of apartment owners
to collect all costs and expenses, including reasonableattorney’s fees, in enforcing breaches of covenants ofapartment owners and similarly allow apartment owners whoare unfairly accused of violating the terms of thedeclaration, bylaws, etc., the right to recover all costsand expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees,resulting from defending themselves from actions of theassociation of apartment owners[.] 
S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 605-76, in 1976 Senate Journal, at 1143; 
see also S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 544-76, in 1976 Senate Journal, at 1120 (Senate Committee on Housing and Hawaiian Homes stating substantially the same purpose). 
Based on the plain meaning of the phrase "any action" 
in HRS § 514B-157(a), as well as its context and purpose, we construe the phrase to mean "any action" taken by the association on its applicable claims. Such action is not limited to court action. 
Here, there is no dispute that AOAO assessed $600 in 
fines to Pendleton's account and collected the fines from Pendleton pursuant to the Fine Policy. On this record, we thus conclude that AOAO took actions on a claim that it had a right to assess and collect such fines pursuant to the Fine Policy. Moreover, in light of the District Court's determination that the Fine Policy did not comply with HRS § 514B-104(a)(l1), AOAO's claim was "not substantiated." HRS § 514B-157(a). Accordingly, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in awarding Pendleton attorney's fees — as well as costs to the extent awarded — under HRS § 514B-157, specifically HRS § 514B-157(a).
