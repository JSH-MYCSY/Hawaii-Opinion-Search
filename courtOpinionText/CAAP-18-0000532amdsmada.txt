NO. CAAP-18-0000532
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
WILLIE JAMES JONES, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI #I, Respondent-Appellee
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(S.P.P. NO. 17-1-0012 (CR. NO. 95-1384))
AMENDED ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL
FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
Upon review of the record in CAAP-18-0000532, it
appears that this court lacks appellate jurisdiction over the
appeal.  Petitioner-Appellant Willie James Jones (Appellant)
appeals from the "Order Denying Petitioner Willie James Jones'[s]
Petition for Post-Conviction Relief Without a Hearing[,]" entered
on May 30, 2018, in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit.  A
notice of appeal must be filed within 30 days after entry of an
appealable judgment or order.  Rule 4(b)(1) of the Hawai #i Rules
of Appellate Procedure (HRAP).  Thus, Appellant had until
June 29, 2018 to file a notice of appeal.  Appellant filed a
Notice of Appeal on June 30, 2018.  Therefore the appeal is
untimely.  "As a general rule, compliance with the requirement of
the timely filing of a notice of appeal is jurisdictional, and we
must dismiss an appeal on our motion if we lack jurisdiction." NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
