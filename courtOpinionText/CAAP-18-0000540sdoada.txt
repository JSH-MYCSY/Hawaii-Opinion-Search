APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 16-1-1179) 
 
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Wadsworth, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
  This appeal concerns whether summary judgment was 
properly granted in an employment discrimination case based on 
age and/or ancestry under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 378-2.  1
1 HRS § 378- 2 (2015) makes it an " unlawful discriminatory practice" 
for any employer to " refuse to hire or employ or to bar or discharge from 
employment, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual in 
compensation or in the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment" based 
on, inter alia, age or ancestry. HRS § 378- 2(a)(1)(A).

Plaintiff-Appellant Celso D. Carabbacan (Carabbacan) 
appeals from the May 18, 2018 "Order Granting [Defendant-
Appellee] Outrigger Canoe Club's [(Outrigger)] Motion for Summary Judgment Filed On February 23, 2018" (Order Granting MSJ); and June 6, 2018 Final Judgment entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court).
2 
On appeal, Carabbacan contends the Circuit Court erred 
in granting Outrigger's Motion for Summary Judgment (MSJ) by 
concluding that Carabbacan "failed to establish a prima facie 
case of employment discrimination[.]"3 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve Carabbacan's contention as follows, and affirm. 
Following an April 18, 2018 hearing on Outrigger's 
MSJ, the Circuit Court granted the motion. The May 18, 2018 Order Granting MSJ stated: 
The Court finds that [Carabbacan] has failed to establish a 
prima facie case of employment discrimination based on 
personal knowledge, direct or circumstantial evidence, 
reasonable inference, or other admissible evidence. With respect to [Carabbacan's] claim his hours were reduced 
[(discriminatory reduction in hours claim)], [Carabbacan] has failed to provide admissible evidence to show any 
similarly situated younger or non- Filipino employee(s) did 
not also have their hours reduced. With respect to 
[Carabbacan's] claim his termination was discriminatory 
[(discriminatory termination claim)], [Carabbacan] has failed to provide admissible evidence that the position 
[Carabbacan] held continued to exist after his termination. 
2 The Honorable Jeffrey P. Crabtree presided. 
3 In Carabbacan's second point of error, after acknowledging that 
the Circuit Court "did not reach" Carabbacan's claim that Outrigger's 
termination of Carabbacan for insubordination was pretextual, Carabbacan nevertheless addresses the "pretext" issue in anticipation of Outrigger's 
argument to affirm summary judgment on this basis. We need not address this 
point of error.

Following the entry of Final Judgment in favor of 
Outrigger, Carabbacan timely appealed. 
"We review a circuit court's award of summary judgment 
de novo under the same standard applied by the circuit court." 
Adams v. CDM Media USA, Inc.
, 135 Hawai‘i 1, 12, 346 P.3d 70, 81 
(2015) (quoting 
Shoppe v. Gucci Am., Inc.
, 94 Hawai‘i 368, 376, 
14 P.3d 1049, 1057 (2000)) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
When analyzing a claim of discrimination that relies on 
circumstantial evidence, Hawai‘ i courts engage in a three-step 
analysis, where (1) "the plaintiff must establish a prima facie 
case of discrimination" (Step 1); (2) once plaintiff meets this 
burden, "the burden of production shifts to the defendant to 
articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action"; and (3) "if the employer rebuts the prima facie case, the burden reverts to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the defendant's proffered reasons were 'pretextual.'" 
Id.
 at 13-14, 346 P.3d at 82-83 (quoting Shoppe
, 
94 Hawai‘i at 378-79, 14 P.3d at 1059-60). 
Here, Carabbacan acknowledges that because the Circuit 
Court ruled that Carabbacan failed to present a prima facie case under Step 1, "the burden shifting analysis of 
McDonnell Douglas 
Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973),/Shoppe v. Gucci Am., Inc., 
94 Hawai‘i 368, 376, 14 P.3d 1049, 1057 (2000)/Adams v. CDM Media 
USA, Inc., 135 Hawai‘ i 1, 12, 346 P.3d 70, 81 (2015), did not 
come into play." We likewise focus our review on whether 
Carabbacan established a prima facie case of discrimination under Step 1. 
To establish a prima facie case of discrimination for 
Step 1, a plaintiff must show, by a preponderance of evidence, the following four elements: 
"(1) that plaintiff is a member of 
a protected class; (2) that plaintiff is qualified for the 
3           
 
 
   
 
  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
position for which plaintiff has applied; (3) that plaintiff has 
suffered some adverse employment action; and (4) that the 
position still exists." Adams, 135 Hawai‘ i at 13, 346 P.3d at 82 
(cleaned up). 
As to the fourth element (Element 4) in cases 
where a plaintiff alleges an adverse employment action but has 
"continued to be employed by the employer, the plaintiff may 
satisfy the fourth element of the prima facie case of discrimination by demonstrating that a similarly situated employee outside of [the plaintiff's] protected class was 
treated more favorably." Kaloi v. Cnty. of Hawai‘ i, 
No. CAAP-15-0000308, 2016 WL 3199477, at *3 (Haw. App. June 8, 
2016) (mem. op.) (citations omitted). 
Here, the Circuit Court's "prima facie case of 
discrimination" analysis turned on Element 4 for both 
Carabbacan's discriminatory reduction in hours claim and his 
discriminatory termination claim. See Adams
, 135 Hawai‘i at 13, 
346 P.3d at 82. 
1. Whether Carabbacan presented evidence for 
Element 4 of his discriminatory reduction in 
hours claim that a similarly situated employee 
outside of Carabbacan's protected class was treated more favorably. 
The Circuit Court concluded that Carabbacan "failed to 
provide admissible evidence to show any similarly situated 
younger or non-Filipino employee(s) did not also have their hours reduced." 
In his Opening Brief, Carabbacan concedes that the 
Circuit Court's conclusion above "is true[,]"and that he did "not produce[] any evidence that he was the only busser whose hours were reduced from 32 per week to 17.5 per week." 
Instead, 
he argues on appeal that "that is not what must be proven" because "[a] plaintiff must show that another employee, outside 
4           
 
 
   
  
  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
his class, was treated more favorably." This argument lacks 
merit. 
Carabbacan's Complaint alleged that he "was subjected 
to unequal terms and conditions of employment including havinghis hours reduced"; that "[c]o-workers who were younger and not of the same ancestry and national origin as [Carabbacan] received more favorable treatment by not having hours reduced"; and that Carabbacan "suffered discrimination in terms, 
conditions, and privileges of his employment due to his national 
origin and age" under HRS § 378-2. See Complaint ¶ 11.b., 
11.c., and 13 (emphases added). Carabbacan claimed that when he asked Outrigger's General Manager why his hours were reduced, he was told that everyone's hours were reduced. 
Outrigger moved for summary judgment on Carabbacan's 
claim in his Complaint paragraph 11.c., that he was treated differently than younger and/or non-Filipino employees because his hours were reduced. Outrigger argued "Carabbacan has no evidence his hours were reduced because of his age or ancestry[.]" 
HRS § 378-2 prohibits discrimination in the terms and 
conditions of employment. Under Kaloi and HRS § 378-2, Element 
4 may be proved "by demonstrating that a similarly situated 
employee outside of [a plaintiff's] protected class was treated more favorably" with respect to a term and condition of employment. Kaloi, 2016 WL 3199477, at *3 (citations omitted). 
Carabbacan's Complaint alleged, under Kaloi and HRS § 378-2, that "[c]o-workers who were younger and not of the same ancestry" as Carabbacan "received more favorable treatment by not having hours reduced . . . ." See Complaint ¶ 11.c. 
Carabbacan's Complaint alleged that the "unequal term[] and condition[] of employment" was "having his hours reduced 
5           
 
 
   
 
  
  
  
 
 
  
  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
. . . ." See Complaint ¶ 11.b. Thus, the language of HRS 
§ 378-2 and Carabbacan's own Complaint do not support 
Carabbacan's argument on appeal that he need only show that an employee outside his protected class "was treated more favorably[,]" untethered from any term and condition of employment such as the claimed reduction in hours. See Kaloi, 
2016 WL 3199477, at *3. 
On this record, the Circuit Court did not err in 
granting summary judgment as to Carabbacan's discriminatory reduction in hours claim for failure to establish a prima facie 
case. See Adams
, 135 Hawai‘i at 12, 346 P.3d at 81. 
2. Whether Carabbacan presented evidence for 
Element 4 of his discriminatory termination 
claim that Carabbacan's position still existed 
when he was terminated. 
The Circuit Court concluded that Carabbacan "failed to 
provide admissible evidence that the position [Carabbacan] held 
continued to exist after his termination." 
The record reflects that Carabbacan was terminated on 
January 16, 2015. 
In his declaration in opposition to the MSJ, 
Carabbacan stated: 
10. On Saturday, January 3, 2015, I received a call that 
business was slow and I should not come to work, even 
though I was scheduled to work. 
11. I went in to work anyway, and [the manager] was mad 
that I came to work. I saw that a new young Mexican boy
was working my position at a big wedding party. 
(Emphases added.) 
To establish a prima facie case, Carabbacan must show 
by a preponderance of evidence that his position still existed 
when he was discharged. See Adams
, 135 Hawai‘i at 13, 346 P.3d 
at 82. In his Opening Brief, Carabbacan does not point to any 
evidence in the record to support his argument that Carabbacan's position still existed as of the January 16, 2015 termination

date. See Hawai‘ i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 
28(b)(7) (requiring argument to contain citations to parts of 
the record relied on). 
Carabbacan's statement that he saw a 
"new" person working in "[his] position" on January 3, 2015, is conclusory and does not show that Carabbacan's "position still 
exist[ed]" when Carabbacan was discharged thirteen days later on 
January 16, 2015. See Adams, 135 Hawai‘ i at 13, 346 P.3d at 82. 
Carabbacan does not include the date of hire of the unnamed "new 
young Mexican" co-worker anywhere in his Opening Brief, nor does he point to evidence of such date of hire in the record. Instead, Carabbacan relies on improper inferences rather than evidence,  which are insufficient to meet the preponderance of 
the evidence standard for a prima facie case of discrimination. 
See Adams, 135

Hawai‘i at 13, 346 P.3d at 82. 
On this record, the Circuit Court did not err in 
granting summary judgment as to Carabbacan's discriminatory 
4 
support his argument that Carabbacan's position still existed as of the 
termination  date, as follows:  Carabbacan points to an "inference" rather than evidence, to 
On January 3, 2015, [Carabbacan] was told that there was no 
work for him, but when he came in anyway, he found a young, 
recently hired Mexican working his shift. There was no 
evidence that [Carabbacan] was terminated a [sic] part of a 
reduction in force. The alleged reason for the termination 
given by OUTRIGGER was "insubordination." Indeed, rather 
than a reduction in force, the hiring of the young Mexican is evidence that the force of bussers was either being 
increased, or the Mexican was hired in advance specifically 
as a replacement for [Carabbacan] .  The position of busser 
is not a unique position for a canoe club operating a restaurant/wedding party facility. There are many people holding that position. The position of busser is an 
essential position at a canoe club operating a restaurant 
wedding party facility. The simple fact that OUTRIGGER had
recently hired a new busser is ample evidence to support an inference that the position still existed as of the date of 
termination.

See id. at 12, 346 P.3d at 81.
