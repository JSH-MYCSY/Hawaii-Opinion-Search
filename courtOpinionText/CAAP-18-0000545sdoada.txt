SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Wadsworth and Nakasone, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Lesieli Teisina (Lesieli) and 
Intervenor-Appellant Penisimani Teisina (Penisimani) (together, 
the Teisinas) appeal from the June 18, 2018 "Findings of Fact [(FOFs)], Conclusions of Law [(COLs)], and Order on Ownership of Parcel 33" (Order) filed by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court),
1 from a jury-waived trial conducted on 
remand,2 on Penisimani's claim of adverse possession from his co-
tenants of a 10,000-square-foot portion of "Parcel 33," a 
property in Lā‘ ie, O‘ahu, that was formally occupied by the 
Teisinas. The Circuit Court's Order concluded that Penisimani 
failed to prove adverse possession against his co-tenants and he 
thus had no interest or title in Parcel 33; and the Order confirmed title to Parcel 33 to Plaintiff-Appellee Hovey B. Lambert, Trustee under the Hovey B. Lambert Trust (Mr. Lambert). 
On appeal, the Teisinas challenge numerous FOFs and 
COLs
3 in the Order, and contend the Circuit Court erred in 
1 The Honorable Bert I. Ayabe presided. 
2 In the previous appeal, the Hawai‘ i Supreme Court affirmed the 
circuit court's ruling that Lesieli did not establish adverse possession, but 
vacated and remanded as to Penisimani
, who had raised a genuine issue of 
material fact as to ownership of Parcel 33, by producing evidence supporting 
his defense of adverse possession. Lambert v. Waha, 137 Hawai‘ i 423, 436, 375 
P.3d 202, 215 
(2016) (Lambert v. Waha)
. 
3 The Teisinas challenge FOFs 7, 8, 10- 17, 20, 24, 27- 29, 31-34, 
and COLs 3, 4, 6, 10- 23. With the exception of COLs 21- 23, which we address, 
the Teisinas present no specific argument containing their reasons 
challenging each FOF and COL "with citations to the authorities, statutes and 
parts of the record relied on." Hawai‘i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 
Rule 28(b)(7). These contentions are waived. See 
id. ("Points not argued 
may be deemed waived."); Lambert v. Waha

this specific challenge is raised" in certiorari application);

concluding Penisimani failed to prove adverse possession against 
his co-tenants and had no title to Parcel 33. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve the Teisinas' contention as follows, and affirm.   Penisimani argues "[h]ow the trial judge reached the 
conclusions in 34 PDF pages 220-221 is beyond explanation and is totally contrary to the evidence and the law . . . ." The above-referenced conclusions at "34 PDF pages 220-221" appear to include COLs 21-23 and the Circuit Court's ultimate conclusion regarding Penisimani's adverse possession claim, which state: 
21. Because neither Mr. Lambert nor his mother, 
Mrs. Lambert,4 were aware of the Teisinas prior to August 
31, 1991, the Teisinas fail in showing the "hostile" 
possession and good faith elements required of a cotenant 
to adversely possess another cotenant's interest in a 
parcel. 
22. Because neither Mr. Lambert nor his mother, 
Mrs. Lambert, were informed by the Teisinas of the 
Teisinas' intent to adversely possess a portion of Parcel 
33 prior to August 31, 1991, the Teisinas fail in showing 
the "hostile" possession and good faith elements required 
of a cotenant to adversely possess another cotenant's 
interest in a parcel. 
23. Mr. Teisina failed to carry his burden of 
proving by clear and positive proof that he satisfied the 
"hostile" possession and good faith elements required of a 
cotenant to adversely possess another cotenant's interest 
in a parcel and accordingly title to Parcel 33 is as 
earlier found by this Court in the Partition Decree, Teisina Order and Confirmation Order.

III. ORDER/CONCLUSION 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT: 1. Title to Parcel 33 as earlier found by this 
Court in the Partition Decree, Teisina Order and 
Confirmation Order is hereby confirmed. Mr. Teisina failed 
to meet his burden of proving adverse possession against 
his co-tenants and therefore, has no title in Parcel 33. 
(Emphases and footnote added.) The COLs and the Order's 
ultimate conclusion are mixed questions of fact and law, which are "reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard because the court's conclusions are dependent upon the facts and circumstances of each individual case." Estate of Klink ex rel.

"In order to establish title to real property by 
adverse possession, a claimant must bear the burden of proving by clear and positive proof each element of actual, open, notorious, hostile, continuous, and exclusive possession for the 
statutory period." Ka‘Upulehu
 Land LLC v. Heirs & Assigns of 
Pahukula
, 136 Hawai‘i 123, 138, 358 P.3d 692, 707 (2015) (quoting 
Wailuku Agribusiness Co., Inc. v. Ah Sam
, 114 Hawai‘i 24, 33, 155 
P.3d, 1125, 1134 (2007)). "In cases where the party is 
asserting adverse possession against a cotenant, there is a special burden in proving hostile possession that requires the cotenants making a claim of adverse possession to show that they had acted in good faith in relation to their cotenants during 
the statutory period." 
Lambert v. Waha
, 137 Hawai‘i at 433, 375 
P.3d at 212 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting 
Wailuku 
Agribusiness
, 114 Hawai‘i at 34, 155 P.3d at 1135). "Good faith 
under the common law typically means 'that the tenant claiming 
adversely must actually notify his or her cotenants that he or 
5      
 
  
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
she is claiming against them.'" Lambert v. Waha, 137 Hawai‘ i at 
435, 375 P.3d at 214 (citation omitted). However, 
[i]n three exceptional instances, less than actual notice 
to cotenants may fulfill the good faith requirement: (1) where the tenant in possession has no reason to suspect 
that a cotenancy exists; (2) where the tenant in possession 
makes a good faith, reasonable effort to notify the 
cotenants but is unable to locate them; or (3) where the 
tenants out of possession already have actual knowledge that the tenant in possession is claiming adversely to 
their interests. 
Id. (cleaned up). 
Here, the parties do not dispute that the relevant 
dates for the 20-year statutory period to establish Penisimani's 
title by adverse possession under HRS § 669-1(b), are August 31, 
1991 to August 31, 2011. See COLs 7, 9; Lambert v. Waha
, 137 
Hawai‘i at 434, 375 P.3d at 213 (stating that tolling date for 
the 20-year statutory period was August 31, 2011, when Penisimani intervened and became a party in this action). The Order focused on Penisimani's actions prior to the start of the August 31, 1991 commencement date. Because Penisimani and the Lamberts were co-tenants, Penisimani was subject to the "special burden" to prove hostile possession of showing he acted in good faith in relation to Mr. Lambert or his predecessor-in-interest, 
Mrs. Lambert, "during the statutory period[,]" which commenced 
on August 31, 1991. 
See Lambert v. Waha
, 137 Hawai‘i at 433, 
375 P.3d at 212 (cleaned up). Good faith required Penisimani to 
"actually notify" his co-tenants, the Lamberts, of his claim against them, unless one of the three exceptions to the good faith requirement applied. 
See id.
 at 435, 375 P.3d at 214. 
The Circuit Court's Order concluded, in Section II.B., that Penisimani "failed to show by clear and positive proof that his actions on Parcel 33 were actual, open, notorious, hostile, 
continuous, and exclusive prior to August 31, 1991." (Emphasis 
6      
 
   
  
 
  
  
 
  
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
added.) The Circuit Court's conclusion turned on this specific 
time frame--prior to the August 31, 1991 commencement of the statutory period. 
COLs 21 and 22 COLs 21 and 22 determined, inter alia, that neither 
Mr. Lambert nor Mrs. Lambert had knowledge or was informed that Penisimani was claiming adversely to their interest in Parcel 33 
prior to August 31, 1991. 
The Teisinas challenge COLs 21 and 22 as "wrong and 
contrary to the evidence and the earlier case started in 1996 by 
Mrs. Lambert[,]" Lambert v. Lua. The Teisinas point to "the pleadings filed in the trial court" in Lambert v. Lua to argue that "Peni[simani] was a known party by virtue of his deed and claimed adverse possession from his possession creating actual and constructive notice to the co-tenants." These arguments are unpersuasive. 
Pleadings are not evidence. Nor are 1996 pleadings 
relevant to whether Mr. Lambert or Mrs. Lambert had knowledge of Penisimani's adverse possession claim prior to or on the August 31, 1991 commencement of the statutory period. These arguments 
do not establish that COLs 21 and 22 are clearly errorenous. 
See Klink
, 113 Hawai‘i at 351, 152 P.3d at 523. 
COL 23 and ultimate conclusion of no adverse 
possession 
COL 23 and the Order's ultimate conclusion stated that 
Penisimani failed to prove adverse possession against his co-
tenants by "clear and positive proof" of "hostile possession" 
and to prove the elements of "good faith" required of a co-tenant to adversely possess another co-tenant's interest. The Teisinas challenge these conclusions as "contrary" to their view of the evidence
, and raise a number of arguments. With the 
7      
 
  
  
 
  
  
 
   
 
 
   
 
    
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
sole exception of the argument based on the July 24, 1991 deed, 
which we address below, none of their arguments point to any evidence for, or relate to, the time frame focal to the Circuit Court's reasoning--i.e., prior to or on the August 31, 1991 commencement of the statutory period.
5 
The Teisinas argue that the "evidence was undisputed" 
that they received a deed "dated July 24, 1991" which, along 
with the "trial evidence plus the file in [Lambert v. Lua],"6 
constituted clear and positive proof of Penisimani's adverse 
possession claim. This argument is without merit. 
Here, the Teisinas' reliance on the deed as 
constituting actual notice for over 20 years to Mrs. Lambert or Mr. Lambert to establish Penisimani's adverse possession claim, was rejected by the Circuit Court as the fact finder. It was properly within the Circuit Court's province to weigh the evidence, resolve all questions of fact, and to arrive at its conclusions after applying the applicable law. See Porter v.
Hu
, 116 Hawai‘i 42, 59-60, 169 P.3d 994, 1011-12 (App. 2007) 
(citation omitted) (stating that decisions with respect to credibility of witnesses and weight of evidence are within province of trial judge as factfinder). The Circuit Court determined that the Quitclaim Deed from Peter K. Lua (Lua), through which the Teisinas acquired their interest in Parcel 33, "although dated July 24, 1991," was not recorded in the Bureau 
of Conveyances of the State of Hawai‘ i until March 17, 1997. FOF 
5 The Teisinas presented arguments referring generally to "1991" as 
follows: "From 1991 through January of 2011, [the Teisinas] lived on the land 
and built a two- story house" and "used the property exclusively for over 20 
years"; and "all the other co- tenants had actual knowledge that the Teisinas 
were occupying that property since 1991." (Emphase s added.) 
6 We have already addressed supra why Penisimani's reliance on 
Lambert v. Lua is misplaced.

12. The Teisinas were informed when they received the deed from 
Lua that he was selling them a co-tenancy interest in Parcel 33. 
FOF 31. The Circuit Court found that the Teisinas never spoke to Mrs. Lambert, and only spoke to her son Mr. Lambert for the first time at the Partition Sale held on June 5, 2012. FOFs 23, 25. 
To establish his claim of adverse possession, 
Penisimani had to actually notify his co-tenant Mr. Lambert, or the predecessor-in-interest Mrs. Lambert, prior to or on the August 31, 1991 commencement of the statutory period. See
Ka‘Upulehu Land
, 136 Hawai‘i at 138, 358 P.3d at 707; 
Lambert
, 137 
Hawai‘i at 433, 375 P.3d at 212. Although the deed was dated 
July 24, 1991, it was not recorded as a public document in the 
Bureau of Conveyances until 1997. See Petran v. Allencastre
, 91 
Hawai‘i 545, 556, 985 P.2d 1112, 1123 (App. 1999) (holding that 
"a cotenant in possession ought to have known of a cotenancy if 
evidence thereof existed in the Bureau of Conveyances"). On this record, the Circuit Court's conclusion that the Teisinas failed to prove Penisimani had an interest in Parcel 33 through adverse possession from August 31, 1991 to August 31, 2011 was 
not clearly erroneous. 
See Klink
, 113 Hawai‘i at 351, 152 P.3d 
at 523. 
In light of our disposition affirming the Circuit 
Court's conclusion that the Teisinas failed to prove adverse 
possession, we need not address the remaining points of error challenging the disapproval of their supersedeas bond and the issuance of the writ of possession.
