(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that:

a notice of appeal from Claimant-Appellant Zebadiah C. Mellin (Mellin), pro se, without the filing fees required by 
Hawai# i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 3(a). On July 12, 2018, the Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board (LIRAB) clerk 
conventionally filed the document in the underlying case as the 
notice of appeal, and on July 13, 2018, the LIRAB clerk 
electronically filed the notice of appeal to create this appeal; 
(2) On August 2, 2018, the Labor and Industrial 
Relations Appeals Board (LIRAB) clerk notified Mellin to pay the NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
filing fee or request a fee waiver by August 16, 2018, or the 
appeal could be dismissed; 
(3) On March 11, 2019, the appellate clerk entered a 
default of the record on appeal, informing Mellin that the time 
to docket the appeal expired on September 11, 2018, he had not 
paid the filing fee or obtained an order allowing him to proceed 
on appeal in forma pauperis, the matter would be brought to the 
court's attention on March 21, 2019, for action that may include 
dismissal of the appeal, and he could seek relief from default by 
motion; 
(4) Mellin took no further action in this appeal; and 
(5) An appeal may be dismissed where the record on 
appeal has not been prepared because the appellant failed to pay the required fees or obtain an order allowing the appellant to 
proceed in forma pauperis. HRAP Rule 11(b)(2), (c)(2). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed. 
Dated: Honolulu, Hawai# i, May 15, 2019.
