IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
MICHAEL DESALES SPIKER, Petitioner-Appellant,
v.
HAWAII PAROLING AUTHORITY, STATE OF HAWAI#I,
Respondent-Appellee
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(S.P.P. NO. 17-1-0027 (CR. NO. 1PC131001702)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Chan, JJ.)
Petitioner-Appellant Michael DeSales Spiker (Spiker), a
self-represented litigant, appeals from the May 14, 2018 Order
Dismissing Petition to Vacate, Set Aside or Correct Judgment or
to Release Petitioner From Custody (Order), entered by the
Circuit Court of the First Circuit1 (circuit court).  The Order
dismissed Spiker's November 29, 2017 Hawai# i Rules of Penal
Procedure Rule 40 Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct
Judgment or to Release Petitioner From Custody (Rule 40 Petition)
on the basis that the fourteen grounds for post-conviction relief
stated therein were without merit, patently frivolous, and
without a trace of support either in the record or from anything
submitted by Spiker.
1The Honorable Glenn J. Kim presided.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
In the Rule 40 Petition, Spiker challenged the Hawai# i
Paroling Authority's (HPA) "Order and Finding of the [HPA]"
(Initial Revocation Order), dated August 21, 2017, wherein the
HPA: adjudged Spiker guilty of violating the terms and conditions
of his parole  following an August 2, 2017 parole revocation
hearing (Initial Revocation Hearing), revoked his parole for the
balance of his maximum sentence, and set a parole consideration
hearing for April 2018.  After the HPA filed its Answer to the
Rule 40 Petition but prior to the circuit court issuing a
disposition, the HPA notified the circuit court and Spiker that
the HPA's appointment of a Deputy Public Defender to represent
Spiker at the Initial Revocation Hearing was in error because the
Public Defender's Office had previously withdrawn from
representing Spiker in the case due to a conflict of interest.2
On appeal, Spiker asserts numerous points to support
his contention that the circuit court erred in dismissing his
Rule 40 Petition and finding that Exhibits B-G, attached thereto,
were irrelevant.3
The grounds stated in Spiker's Rule 40 Petition are
moot, as the HPA set the new parole revocation hearing.  Thus,
any error occurring during the first revocation hearing has been
nullified and there is no further effective remedy that can be
afforded to him on appeal.  See Kaho #ohanohano  v. State, 114
Hawai#i 302, 332, 162 P.3d 696, 726 (2007).  We observe, however,
that on its face, the minimal record on appeal indicates that
Spiker was arrested and recommitted on July 2, 2017, signaling
that the setting of Spiker's new parole revocation hearing for
April 12, 2018, exceeded the sixty-day limits set forth in Hawaii
2The HPA determined that Spiker had violated the terms and conditions
of his parole under Cr. No. 13-1-1702 by: (1) failing to report on June 29, 2017;
and (2) failing to notify his parole officer of his whereabouts.  Spiker pled
guilty as to the first alleged violation and HPA found Spiker guilty of the second
alleged violation based on evidence presented by "Parole Officer."
3We interpret this point as a challenge to the circuit court's
conclusion that Spiker's claims were "without a trace of support . . . from
anything submitted by [Spiker]."
