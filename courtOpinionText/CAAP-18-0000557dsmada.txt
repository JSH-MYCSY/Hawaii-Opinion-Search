ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL 
(By: 
Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Chan, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that: 
(1) On July 16, 2018, Petitioner-Appellant William A. 
Cornelio, III (Cornelio), pro se, filed the notice of appeal; 
(2) On August 31, 2018, the circuit court clerk filed 
the record on appeal, and the appellate clerk notified the parties that the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief were 
due on or before September 10, 2018, and October 10, 2018, 
respectively; 
(3)
 Cornelio did not file either document or request an 
extension of time; 
(4)
 On October 30, 2018, the appellate clerk notified 
Cornelio that the time for filing the statement of jurisdiction 
and opening brief had expired, the matter would be called to the 
court's attention on November 9, 2018, for appropriate action, 
which could include dismissal of the appeal, pursuant to Hawai# i NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rules 12.1(e) and 30, and 
Cornelio may request relief from default by motion; 
(5) On December 4, 2018, the court granted Cornelio's 
November 19, 2018 motion for relief from default and a first 
extension of time for the statement of jurisdiction and opening 
brief to January 7, 2019. The court cautioned Cornelio that any 
further default of the statement of jurisdiction or opening brief 
may result in sanctions authorized by HRAP Rules 12.1(e) or 30, 
including, without limitation, the appeal being dismissed; and 
(6) The appellate clerk mailed the December 4, 2018 
order to Cornelio at Saguaro Correctional Center in Eloy, 
Arizona, which is Cornelio's address of record in this appeal. 
The United States Postal Service returned the order as 
undeliverable. Cornelio has not filed a notice of change of 
address, as required by HRAP Rule 25(f), and he took no further 
action in this appeal. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed, under HRAP Rules 12.1(e) and 30, respectively, for 
failure to file the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief.
