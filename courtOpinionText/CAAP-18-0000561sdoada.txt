APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 3CC17100305K) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Hiraoka and Nakasone, JJ.) 
Plaintiff-Appellant Paliksru Brooks appeals from: 
(1) the "
Order  Granting Defendant Kona Coast Shellfish, LLC's 
Motion to Dismiss First Amended Complaint Filed November 14, 
2017, Filed January 29, 2018," entered by the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit on March 23, 2018; and (2) the "Final Judgment"
in favor of Defendant-Appellee Kona Coast Shellfish, LLC entered 
on June 25, 2018.   For the reasons explained below, we vacate 
the Order and the Judgment and remand for further proceedings. 1 
Brooks filed a civil complaint against Kona Coast, his 
former employer.  He filed an Amended Complaint on November 14, 
2017.  Kona Coast filed a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) 
1 The Honorable Melvin H. Fujino presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of the Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP).   The motion was 
heard on February 21, 2018.  The circuit court orally granted the 
motion.  The Order was entered on March 23, 2018.  The Judgment was entered on June 25, 2018.  This appeal followed. 2
A circuit court's ruling on an HRCP Rule 12(b) motion 
to dismiss is reviewed de novo.  Bank of Am., N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 143 Hawai# i 249, 256, 428 P.3d 761, 768 (2018).  The 
circuit court's stated reasons for its decision neither bind nor restrict our appellate review. 
[A] complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a
claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff canprove no set of facts in support of [their] claim that wouldentitle [them] to relief.  The appellate court musttherefore view a plaintiff's complaint in a light mostfavorable to [the plaintiff] in order to determine whetherthe allegations contained therein could warrant relief underany alternative theory.  For this reason, in reviewing acircuit court's order dismissing a complaint the appellate
court's consideration is strictly limited to the allegationsof the complaint, and the appellate court must deem thoseallegations to be true . 
Id. at 257, 428 P.3d at 769 (cleaned up) (emphasis added). 
The notice-pleading standard governs in Hawai# i.  
Reyes-Toledo, 143 Hawai# i at 263, 428 P.3d at 775.  HRCP Rule 
8(a) states, in relevant part, that "[a] pleading which sets 
forth a claim for relief . . . shall contain (1) a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief, and (2) a demand for judgment for the relief the pleader seeks." 
2 HRCP Rule 12 provides, in relevant part: 
Rule 12. DEFENSES AND OBJECTIONS — WHEN AND HOW PRESENTED — 
BY PLEADING OR MOTION — MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS. 
. . . . 
(b)
 How Presented .  Every defense, in law or fact, to a
claim for relief in any pleading, whether a claim,counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, shall beasserted in the responsive pleading thereto if one isrequired, except that the following defenses may at theoption of the pleader be made by motion: . . . (6) failureto state a claim upon which relief can be granted[.] 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Amended Complaint alleged that Brooks is 
Micronesian-Kosraean and had worked for Kona Coast as an algae 
technician since 2011.  For purposes of our appellate review we assume (but do not decide) that the following allegations contained in the Amended Complaint are true: 
10. [Brooks] belongs to the protected class of
individuals because of his ancestry and national origin
(i.e., Micronesian-Kosrae [sic]). 
11. During his employment, [Brooks] was subjected to
a continuing course or pattern of discriminatory acts by[Kona Coast]'s representatives, including its managementemployees, that escalated in frequency and intensity,intending to create a hostile work environment. 
. . . . 
14. [Brooks] would raise the algae, clean and
maintain the algae tanks.  He took his job seriously andbecause of his efforts he increased the production levelsand quality of algae being raised on site and through hisefforts of observation, trial and error, he resolvedpersistent problems of poor algae production, die off andcontamination. 
15. Often and during the calendar year of 2016,
[Brooks] worked seven (7) days a week without additionalcompensation or overtime. 
. . . . 
24. . . . [Brooks]'s supervisors, [sic]
discriminated against [Brooks] by ridiculing him in front ofhis co-workers, refused to acknowledge him for his work, andrefused to do anything when he raised his concerns andcomplaints of discrimination and disparate treatment withinthe company. 
. . . . 
27. In April of 2016, [Brooks] was told by [the Farm
Manager] that he was being promoted and would be given araise of $1.00 per hour. 
28. In May of 2016, [Brooks]'s promotion and raise
was announced to his co-workers in a team meeting by [hissupervisor]. 
29. [Brooks] waited patiently for his promotion and
raise but he never received his promotion or raise until theend of August of 2016, after [Brooks] had to ask [the FarmManager] what had happened to his promotion and raise. 
30. [Brooks]'s promotion was a sham because it just
meant that in addition to maintaining and raising algae, hewould now be responsible for maintaining and raising clams. 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
31. In August of 2016, [Brooks] told [the Farm
Manager] that his wages were unfair and that he was being
paid $2.00 an hour less that [sic] his co-worker[.] . . . 
. . . . 
39. [Brooks] complained about the disparate hourly
wage, bonuses and promotion, including but not limited to[working through his 30-minute lunch period, but beingdocked 30 minutes of overtime]. . . . 
40. [Brooks] was subjected to overt workplace
discrimination by [his supervisor], including but notlimited to: 
a. . . . [Brooks's supervisor] mocked and
humiliated [Brooks], in the presence of . . .co-workers that [Brooks] couldn't speak "goodEnglish."  [Brooks] estimated [Brooks's supervisor]did this over ten (10) times[.] . . . 
. . . . 
f. After having informed [Brooks] about his
raise and promotion, and announcing it to [Brooks]'sco-workers, [Brooks's supervisor] deliberately andintentionally withheld [Brooks]'s raise and promotion,until [Brooks] had to make a complaint to the FarmManager[.] 
g. [Brooks's supervisor] ridiculed and
humiliated [Brooks] in the presence of [Brooks]'sco-workers, that he couldn't spell properly, becausesomeone misspelled the word "bucket" on the office"Things to Buy" board. . . . 
. . . . 
41. . . . [Kona Coast's] Farm Manager and . . .
Human Resources Specialist, [sic] were aware of [Brooks]'sconcerns and complaints but did nothing about it [sic], noinvestigation was conducted and [Kona Coast] did not takeany remedial action. 
42. On or about January 5, 2017, [Brooks]'s level of
mistrust and stress resulting from [his supervisor]'sdiscriminatory mistreatment and the refusal to act orconduct any investigation into [Brooks]'s concerns andcomplaints, was so severe and pervasive that [Brooks] couldno longer tolerate the workplace conditions and felt he hadno other choice but to resign and was constructivelydischarged. 
. . . . 
45. [Brooks]'s supervisor and management employees
had a pattern and practice of discriminating against[Brooks] due to his ancestry and national origin, i.e.,Micronesian-Kosrae [sic], as previously alleged herein. 
. . . . 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
55. [Kona Coast]'s actions were severe and pervasive
and created a hostile and abusive workplace environment,
which unreasonably interfered with [Brooks]'s workperformance as detailed, supra. 
. . . . 
61. [Brooks] is a member of a protected class
(Micronesian-Kosrae [sic]); similarly situated females andmales were treated differently than [Brooks] and disparatetreatment occurred because of [Brooks]'s ancestry andnational origin. 
Count I alleged that Kona Coast discriminated against Brooks in 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 378-2.3  Count II 
alleged Kona Coast allowed Brooks to be subject to a hostile work environment in violation of HRS § 378-2.  Count III alleged that Brooks was subject to disparate treatment based upon his ancestry and national origin in violation of HRS § 378-2.  Count IV, titled "Wilful and Wanton Misconduct[,]" alleged that Kona Coast intentionally injured Brooks.  The Amended Complaint prays for "general and special damages[,]" "reinstatement, back salary and fringe benefits[,]" "front pay and accrued benefits[,]" "compensatory damages," attorney's fees and costs, pre- and post-judgment interest, and "such other relief" as the court "may deem just and proper." 
Kona Coast argues that Brooks's Amended Complaint 
failed to plead: that he was mocked and treated unequally because of his race or ancestry; that the alleged misconduct relating to overtime, bonuses, hourly raises, and promotions was severe or pervasive; or that Brooks was constructively discharged because of discrimination based on race or ancestry.  However, "HRCP Rule 
3 HRS § 378-2 (2015), provides, in relevant part: 
§ 378-2  Discriminatory practices made unlawful; offenses 
defined.   (a)  It shall be an unlawful discriminatory 
practice: 
(1) Because of race, . . . [or] ancestry[:] 
(A) For any employer to . . .
discriminate against any individualin compensation or in the terms,conditions, or privileges ofemployment[.]

8(a)(1) does not require the pleading of facts[.]"  Reyes-Toledo, 
143 Hawai# i at 258, 428 P.3d at 770 (citation omitted).  Compare 
HRCP Rule 8(a)(1) with HRCP Rule 9(c) ("In pleading the performance or occurrence of conditions precedent, it is sufficient to aver generally that all conditions precedent have been performed or have occurred.  A denial of performance or occurrence shall be made specifically and with particularity.") and HRCP Rule 9(g) ("When items of special damage are claimed, they shall be specifically stated.").  We also note that HRCP Rule 8(f) requires that we construe Brooks's Amended Complaint "as to do substantial justice." 
We conclude that the Amended Complaint provided fair 
notice to Kona Coast that Brooks was asserting claims for violation of HRS § 378-2 based on his race and ancestry.  The Amended Complaint alleged that Brooks belonged to a class of persons protected by the statute; that he was qualified for his position and performed his job satisfactorily; that he experienced various adverse employment actions; and that circumstances surrounding the alleged adverse employment actions gave rise to an inference of discrimination.  See U.S. Equal Emp't Opportunity Comm'n v. Glob. Horizons, Inc., 904 F. Supp. 2d 1074, 1087 (D. Haw. 2012) (concerning motion to dismiss complaint under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to correct allegedly unlawful employment practices on the basis of national origin and race).
4  Kona Coast's arguments to the contrary go to 
the merits of Brooks's claims, not to the sufficiency of his pleading. 
Based on the foregoing, we vacate the "Order Granting 
Defendant Kona Coast Shellfish, LLC's Motion to Dismiss First Amended Complaint Filed November 14, 2017, Filed January 29, 2018," entered on March 23, 2018, and the "Final Judgment" 
4 Federal courts' interpretations of Title VII of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964 are persuasive, although not controlling, over a Hawai #i state 
court's interpretation of HRS § 378-2.  Arquero v. Hilton Hawaiian Vill. LLC,
