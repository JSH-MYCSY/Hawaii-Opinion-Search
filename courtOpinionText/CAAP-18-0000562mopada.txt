v.
LISA LYNNE BARBOUR aka LISA LYNNE MCCAFFREY,
Defendant-Appellee
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CRIMINAL NO. 1PC161000537)
MEMORANDUM OPINION
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Chan, JJ.)
Plaintiff-Appellant State of Hawai#i (State) appeals
from the "Order of Dismissal and Discharge" (Order of Dismissal),
filed June 15, 2018, and the corresponding "Findings of Facts,
Conclusions of Law and Order Dismissing Charge with Prejudice for
Violation of [ Hawai#i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP)] Rule 48,
Violation of Speedy Trial and Want of Prosecution" (FOF/COL),
filed July 16, 2018, in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
(circuit court).1
On appeal, the State contends that the circuit court
erred in granting Defendant-Appellee Lisa L. Barbour's (Barbour)
motion to dismiss because the circuit court failed to exclude:

matter.  On April 18, 2018, the matter was transferred to the Honorable Karen T.

(1) the period of time between the date Barbour was arrested
under a bench warrant issued after she failed to appear for trial
and her reset trial date; and (2) the period of delay caused by
Barbour's first counsel filing a motion for withdrawal and
substitution of counsel, and the subsequent appointment of second
counsel.  The State further argues that the circuit court erred
in dismissing the case with prejudice because a significant
portion of the delay in the commencement of trial was caused by
Barbour herself and Barbour would not suffer any prejudice from a
reprosecution.  The State specifically challenges the circuit
court's Findings of Facts (FOFs) 7 and 8, and Conclusions of Law
(COLs) 2 and 5.
I.  BACKGROUND
On April 3, 2016, Barbour was arrested for unauthorized
entry in a dwelling.  On April 6, 2016, the State filed a Felony
Information charging Barbour with Unauthorized Entry in a
Dwelling in the Second Degree, in violation of Hawaii Revised
Statutes (HRS) § 708-812.6 (2014).2
On April 11, 2016, Barbour, with counsel from the
Office of the Public Defender, appeared in the circuit court via
video from Oahu Community Correctional Center (OCCC) for
arraignment and plea.  Barbour received a copy of the Felony
Information, waived reading of the charge, and entered a not
guilty plea.  The circuit court set jury trial for the week of
June 13, 2016.
On May 31, 2016, at a hearing for a pretrial conference
and trial call, Barbour requested that trial call be moved to
June 7, 2016.  With no objection from the State, the circuit
2HRS § 708-812.6 provides, in relevant part:
§708-812.6  Unauthorized entry in a dwelling in the
second degree.   (1)  A person commits the offense of
unauthorized entry in a dwelling in the second degree if the
person intentionally or knowingly enters unlawfully into a
dwelling and another person was lawfully present in the
dwelling.
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
court continued trial call to June 7, 2016.
On June 7, 2016, the circuit court granted Barbour's
motion for supervised release.  Barbour's counsel requested a
continuance of the trial.  The State indicated that it was ready
to proceed with trial and objected to the continuance.  Over the
State's objection, the circuit court continued the jury trial to
the week of August 22, 2016, with trial call scheduled for
August 9, 2016.  Barbour waived her rights under HRPP Rule 48 and
her constitutional rights to a speedy trial for the time period
from June 7, 2016 to August 22, 2016.
On June 20, 2016, the State filed a "Motion for
Revocation of Supervised Release; Issuance of Bench Warrant"
based on Barbour's violations of the terms of her supervised
release.  The circuit court issued a bench warrant for Barbour's
arrest on the same day.
At trial call on August 9, 2016, Barbour did not appear
and Barbour's counsel indicated that he did not know Barbour's
whereabouts.  The circuit court vacated the jury trial for the
week of August 22, 2016, and let the June 20, 2016 bench warrant
for Barbour's arrest stand.
On February 5, 2018, Barbour was arrested and served
with the June 20, 2016 bench warrant.
On February 12, 2018, with Barbour present in the
courtroom, the circuit court granted the State's motion to revoke
supervised release.  The circuit court also reset the trial week
to July 16, 2018, with trial call on July 2, 2018, explaining as
follows:
THE COURT: (Inaudible).
The next available trial week the Court has, based on
the Court's busy trial schedule and other (inaudible)
issues, is the week of July 16, 2018.
Counsel, as you know, this Court handles all of the
misdemeanor --
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: No.  I hear you.
THE COURT: -- jury demand cases on the island.  We now
have more felony cases assigned to us than misdemeanor
cases.  We have the PD seminar week (inaudible).  So the
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Court is not available for trial.
So the next available trial week -- and this is going
to be your trial week -- this will be for July 16, 2018.
Trial call is on Monday, July 2, 2018, at 8:30 A.M.  The
pretrial motions deadline is June (inaudible), 2018.
In response to the scheduled trial date, the parties discussed
HRPP Rule 48 as follows:
[PROSECUTOR]:  Your Honor, the time from now to Rule
48 should be excluded under -- I'm sorry -- I believe Rule
48(c)(5).  I might be off.  But, essentially, as a result of
the defendant's nonappearance at the last trial call.
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  And, Your Honor, I would ask that
you reserve ruling.  At some point I think this is an issue
of court congestion that it's so far out.  I would
understand, if it was just a couple months from now, that
that would be charged to the defendant.  But --
THE COURT:  But it's not an extraordinary
circumstance, [defense counsel].
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  Exactly.  So --
THE COURT:  This is the nature of this --
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  -- if it's normal court
congestion, I'm saying that should be charged to the
government.  I don't --
[PROSECUTOR]:  I believe congestion is meant that on
that week of trial, there are other cases going, not the
scheduling (indiscernible).  And it's still a result, no
matter what, of her nonappearance.
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  And I'm saying if the Court set
this ten years out and the State took that position --
THE COURT:  That would be --
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  -- that would be absurd.
THE COURT:  -- extraordinary.
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  Yeah -- no, no.  I mean --
THE COURT:  But this is in normal course.
All right.  So you're asking --
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  And -- and I guess I just disagree
as to that, Your Honor.
THE COURT:  What -- what period (indiscernible),
[defense counsel]?
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  At least -- at least two months,
from -- from May to July.  And then I could argue that
later.
THE COURT:  From May till July?
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
[PROSECUTOR]:  (Indiscernible).  That's what I ask.
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  Because I -- I -- because normally
I would argue that normal --
THE COURT:  Okay.
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  -- course would be about two and a
half --
THE COURT:  I'm not going to rule on Rule 48.
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  Thank you.
THE COURT:  If this becomes an issue, you brief it,
and then I'll rule.
On February 21, 2018, Barbour's counsel moved to
withdraw as counsel and to appoint substitute counsel.  On
March 6, 2018, the circuit court orally granted the motion.  On
March 7, 2018, the circuit court issued an order appointing
Brandon K. Flores (second counsel) as Barbour's substitute
counsel.  At a status hearing on March 19, 2018, with Barbour
represented by second counsel, the circuit court reconfirmed that
trial week was scheduled for July 16, 2018, with trial call on
July 2, 2018.
On April 18, 2018, the case was transferred from the
Honorable Christine E. Kuriyama to the Honorable Karen T.
Nakasone.
On May 21, 2018, second counsel filed a motion to
withdraw as counsel and to appoint substitute counsel.  On
May 29, 2018, the circuit court granted the motion.  On May 30,
2018, the circuit court issued an order appointing Harrison L.
Kiehm as Barbour's substitute counsel (present counsel).
On June 1, 2018, the State filed "State's Memorandum on
Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 48 Calculation as of June 1,
2018."
On June 4, 2018, the circuit court held a status
conference regarding the HRPP Rule 48 computation.  The circuit
court verbally ruled that the period of time from August 22, 2016
(the prior trial date), to February 5, 2018 (the date Barbour was
arrested under the bench warrant), was charged to the defense due
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
to Barbour's bench warrant status.  The circuit court reserved
ruling on the period of time after February 5, 2018, noting that
the parties dispute the computation.  With no objection from
either party, the circuit court advanced the trial week to
June 25, 2018, with trial call scheduled for June 12, 2018.
At trial call on June 12, 2018, the State requested a
continuance of the proceedings, explaining that subpoenas had
been sent out but it had not heard back from all.  Barbour
indicated her intent to file a motion to dismiss.  Trial call and
the hearing on Barbour's motion to dismiss were continued to
June 15, 2018.
On June 13, 2018, Barbour filed her "Motion to Dismiss
Charge for Violation of HRPP Rule 48, Motion to Dismiss Charge
for Violation of Speedy Trial and Motion to Dismiss Charge for
Want of Prosecution" (Motion to Dismiss).  Barbour submitted the
following calculations and argued that the six-month period under
HRPP Rule 48 expired on June 9, 2018:
State Defendant
04/03/2016 - 06/07/2016 65
06/07/2016 - 08/09/2016 63
08/09/2016 - 02/05/2018 545
02/05/2018 - 05/21/2018 105
05/21/2018 - 05/30/2018 9
05/30/2018 - 06/09/2018 10
Total Days: 180 617
On June 15, 2018, the circuit court held a hearing on
Barbour's Motion to Dismiss.  The circuit court adopted Barbour's
computations and granted Barbour's Motion to Dismiss, dismissing
the case with prejudice pursuant to the three-factor test set
forth in State v. Estencion, 63 Haw. 264, 625 P.2d 1040 (1981).
The circuit court filed its Order of Dismissal later that same
day.  On July 16, 2018, the circuit court filed its FOF/COL.  The
FOF/COL stated:
6NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
FINDINGS OF FACT
1.  On April 3, 2016, Defendant was arrested and bail
set.
2.  Defendant was formally charged with the offense of
Unauthorized Entry in a Dwelling in the Second Degree by
Felony Information, filed April 6, 2016.
3.  On June 1, 2018, the State filed State's
Memorandum on Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 48
Calculation as of June 1, 2018 ("State's Memorandum").
4.  On June 13, 2018, Defendant filed a Motion to
Dismiss Charge for Violation of HRPP Rule 48; Motion to
Dismiss Charge for Violation of Speedy Trial; and Motion to
Dismiss Charge for Want of Prosecution ("Defendant's
Motions").
5.  In State's Memorandum, the State claimed that as
of June 1, 2018, HRPP Rule 48 will not ripen until
November 15, 2018.
6.  In Defendant's Motions, the Defendant claimed that
a total of 797 days elapsed from the date of Defendant's
arrest to June 9, 2018.
7.  After subtracting 180 days pursuant to HRPP Rule
48, the balance of days exceeding the six-month trial
requirement of HRPP Rule 48 is 617 days of which the Court
finds excludable.[3]
8.  Accordingly, the Court adopts Defendant's
calculations and finds that as of June 9, 2018, 180
nonexcludable days elapsed.  Therefore, no trial had
commenced within six-months.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
1.  HRPP Rule 48 requires dismissal of a criminal
charge upon motion by a defendant if trial does not commence
within six-months of arrest if bail is set.
2.  As of June 9, 2018, the six-month trial
requirement of HRPP Rule 48 ripened; therefore, HRPP Rule 48
requires dismissal of the charge.
3.  The test for deciding whether a dismissal should
be with, or without prejudice, under HRPP Rule 48 was
articulated by the Hawaii Supreme Court in State v.
Estencion, 63 Haw. 254 (1981).
4.  In determining if a charge should be dismiss
with, or without prejudice, the Court shall consider, 
others, each of the following factors: the seriousness
the offense; the facts and circumstances which led to 
dismissal; and the impact of re-prosecution on the
administration of justice.ed
among
 of
the
5.  Based on the factors set forth in State v.
Estencion, 63 Haw. 254 (1981), and upon review of the
records and files, and the evidence and arguments presented
at the hearing, the dismissal of the charge is with
prejudice.
The State timely appealed.
3In making FOF 7, the circuit court did not adequately explain what
periods of delay were excluded and on what bases they were excluded.
7NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
II.  STANDARDS OF REVIEW
A trial court's findings of fact (FOFs) in deciding an HRPP
48(b) motion to dismiss are subject to the clearly erroneous
standard of review.  An FOF is clearly erroneous when,
despite evidence to support the finding, the appellate court
is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake
has been committed.  However, whether those facts fall
within HRPP 48(b)'s exclusionary provisions is a question of
law, the determination of which is freely reviewable
pursuant to the "right/wrong" test.
State v. Choy Foo, 142 Hawai# i 65, 72, 414 P.3d 117, 124 (2018)
(quoting State v. Samonte, 83 Hawai#i 507, 514, 928 P.2d 1, 8
(1996)).
Whether a dismissal should be with or without prejudice
is a matter that lies within the discretion of the trial court. 
HRPP Rule 48(b) ("[T]he court shall, on motion of the defendant,
dismiss the charge, with or without prejudice in its discretion .
. . ." (emphasis added)).  We review a trial court's decision to
dismiss a case with or without prejudice for abuse of discretion. 
See Estencion, 63 Haw. at 269, 625 P.2d at 1044.  "An abuse of
discretion occurs when the decisionmaker 'exceeds the bounds of
reason or disregards rules or principles of law or practice to
the substantial detriment of a party.'"  State v. Kony, 138
Hawai#i 1, 8, 375 P.3d 1239, 1246 (2016) (quoting State v. Vliet,
95 Hawai# i 94, 108, 19 P.3d 42, 56 (2001)).
III.  DISCUSSION
HRPP Rule 48(b) mandates the dismissal of criminal
charges if a trial on those charges is not commenced within six
months, construed as one hundred eighty days, from the time of
the arrest or of filing of charges, whichever is sooner.  Section
(c) of HRPP Rule 48 provides eight categories of delay that are
to be excluded in computing the six-month time period within
which trial must commence.
"HRPP [Rule] 48 is intended not only to ensure speedy
trial for criminal defendants, but also to relieve congestion in
the trial court, to promptly process all cases reaching the
courts, and to advance the efficiency of the criminal justice
8NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
process."  State v. Hoey, 77 Hawai#i 17, 29, 881 P.2d 504, 516
(1994) (internal citations, quotation marks, and original
brackets omitted).
A.The circuit court erred in failing to exclude the period of
delay between February 21, 2018, through March 7, 2018.
We first address the State's argument that the time
period between February 21, 2018 (the date Barbour's first
counsel filed a motion to withdraw as counsel), to March 7, 2018
(the date subsequent counsel was appointed), should be excluded
for purposes of computing the six-month time period for HRPP Rule
48.  Under HRPP Rule 48(c)(1), "periods that delay the
commencement of trial and are caused by collateral or other
proceedings concerning the defendant" are excluded.  HRPP Rule
48(d)(1)  provides further guidance as to the application of HRPP
Rule 48(c)(1) and identifies certain periods of time that are per
se excludable or per se includable in computing the time for
trial commencement.  HRPP Rule 48(d)(1) provides that the time
period from the filing through the prompt disposition of a motion
"for withdrawal of counsel including the time period for
appointment of new counsel if so ordered" shall be deemed to be a
"period[] of delay resulting from collateral or other proceedings
concerning the defendant" under HRPP Rule 48(c)(1), and is per se
excludable.4
Accordingly, pursuant to HRPP Rule 48(d)(1), the time
4HRPP Rule 48(d)(1) provides:
For purposes of subsection (c)(1) of this rule, the period of
time, from the filing through the prompt disposition of the
following motions filed by a defendant, shall be deemed to be
periods of delay resulting from collateral or other
proceedings concerning the defendant: motions to dismiss, to
suppress, for voluntariness hearing heard before trial, to
sever counts or defendants, for disqualification of the
prosecutor, for withdrawal of counsel including the time
period for appointment of new counsel if so ordered, for
mental examination, to continue trial, for transfer to the
circuit court, for remand from the circuit court, for change
of venue, to secure the attendance of a witness by a material
witness order, and to secure the attendance of a witness from
without the state.
9NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
period between February 21, 2018, and March 7, 2018, is per se
excludable and the circuit court erred in failing to exclude this
time period in its HRPP Rule 48 computations.5
B.The six-month period under HRPP Rule 48 had not elapsed as
of the date Barbour filed her Motion to Dismiss.
As of June 13, 2018, the date that Barbour filed her
Motion to Dismiss, a total of 801 days had elapsed from the date
of Barbour's initial arrest on April 3, 2016.  Both parties
concede that as of February 5, 2018, 65 days were attributable to
the State and 608 days were attributable to Barbour and
excludable.  As we discussed supra, the 14-day period of delay
between February 21, 2018, and March 7, 2018, should have been
excluded for the withdrawal of Barbour's first counsel and
appointment of Barbour's second counsel, pursuant to HRPP Rule
48(d)(1).  Similarly, the 9-day period of delay between May 21,
2018, and May 30, 2018, was properly excluded for the withdrawal
of Barbour's second counsel and appointment of Barbour's present
counsel.  Even if the remaining time periods following
February 5, 2018, were charged to the State, 170 non-excludable
days would have elapsed and the six-month period under HRPP Rule
48 would not have expired as of the date Barbour filed her Motion
to Dismiss.  Thus, the circuit court erred in granting Barbour's
Motion to Dismiss and we remand this matter for further
proceedings.6
C.The record is insufficient for this court to determine
whether the circuit court erred in failing to exclude the
rest of the period following February 5, 2018.
The State argues that the time period after Barbour's
arrest on February 5, 2018, and until the start of trial should
5Our holding is consistent with the circuit court's proper exclusion
of the time period between May 21, 2018, and May 30, 2018, for the withdrawal and
substitution of Barbour's second counsel, which we do not disturb on appeal.
6In light of our conclusion that the circuit court erred in
dismissing the case, we need not address the State's point of error contending
that it was error for the circuit court to dismiss the case with prejudice.
10NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
be excluded under HRPP Rule 48(c)(5)  because the delay was
ultimately caused by Barbour's unavailability at trial call on
August 9, 2016, and during her bench warrant.7
Barbour responds that once she was arrested and taken
into custody on February 5, 2018, she was not "absent" or
"unavailable" and any delay in scheduling the trial after this
date should be attributable to the State.  Barbour also contends
that the State's argument would lead to "the absurd result that
the State can sit idle and a new trial week can be rescheduled
after any amount of time [after a bench warrant issued due to the
defendant's prior absence or unavailability is served] without
regard to HRPP Rule 48."
The State relies on State v. Rivera, No.
SCWC–11–0000774, 2014 WL 470678, at *1-2 (Haw. Feb. 6, 2014)
(SDO), in supporting its contention that the entire time period
between Barbour's failure to appear for trial call and her reset
trial date should be excluded.  In Rivera, a jury trial was
scheduled for the week of October 4, 2010, with trial call on
September 27, 2010.  State v. Rivera, No. CAAP–11–0000774, 2012
WL 4344185, at *1 (Haw. App. Sept. 24, 2012) (SDO), vacated on
other grounds, No. SCWC–11–0000774, 2014 WL 470678 (Haw. Feb. 6,
2014) (SDO).  As a result of the defendant's absence at the trial
call on September 27, 2010, the trial court issued a bench
warrant for the defendant's arrest.  Id.  On October 6, 2010, the
bench warrant was recalled and trial was reset to November 15,
2010.  Id.  The Hawai#i Supreme Court held that the defendant's
unavailability at the September 27, 2010 trial call resulted in
the trial court resetting the trial for the week of November 15,
2010.  Rivera, 2014 WL 470678, at *2.  The supreme court affirmed
our decision that the period between September 27, 2010 and
November 15, 2010 was excludable under HRPP Rule 48(c)(5) based
7HRPP Rule 48(c)(5) provides that "periods that delay the
commencement of trial and are caused by the absence or unavailability of the
defendant" are "excluded in computing the time for trial commencement[.]"
11NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
on the defendant's prior unavailability at the trial call.  Id.
The instant matter is factually distinct from Rivera
with regard to the length of the delay in resetting trial
resulting from the defendant's unavailability at a previous trial
call.  In Rivera, the reset trial date was just over one month
after the bench warrant was recalled.  In this case, Barbour's
trial date was initially reset to July 16, 2018, over five months
after Barbour was arrested under the bench warrant on February 5,
2018.  The circuit court explained that July 16, 2018, was the
next available trial week due to the court's "busy trial
schedule[.]"  However, the record does not provide further
explanation as to the factual circumstances surrounding the
circuit court's decision to reset trial to such a late date.8
To allow a jury trial to be held an unreasonably
extended period of time after a defendant is arrested under a
bench warrant issued because of a prior unavailability would
subvert the purposes of HRPP Rule 48 to provide a defendant with
a speedy trial.  We therefore reject the State's request to
automatically exclude the entire period of time following
Barbour's arrest on February 5, 2018, to the rescheduled trial
dates, based on HRPP Rule 48(c)(5).
However, we agree that a reasonable portion of the
delay in commencing trial is attributable to Barbour.
Accordingly, we direct the circuit court, upon remand, to
determine what period of delay following Barbour's arrest is
reasonably attributable to Barbour due to her prior
unavailability and to exclude the period from Rule 48
8It appears that, after the transfer of this case from the Honorable
Christine E. Kuriyama to the Honorable Karen T. Nakasone, the circuit court
recognized that the July 16, 2018 trial week potentially created an HRPP Rule 48
issue and therefore advanced the trial week to June 25, 2018.  Nonetheless, the
reset trial date was still about 4½ months after Barbour had been arrested on
February 5, 2018.
