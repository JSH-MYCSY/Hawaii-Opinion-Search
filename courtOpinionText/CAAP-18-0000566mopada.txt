v. 
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Respondent-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
(CASE NO. 2SPP 17-0006)  
MEMORANDUM OPINION 
(By: 
Leonard, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Nakasone, JJ.) 
Petitioner-Appellant Kyle Livingston (L

appeals from the Findings of Fact (FOFs), Conclusions of Law 
(COLs), and Order filed and entered by the Circuit Court of the 
Second Circuit (Circuit Court) on May 31, 2018 (Order), 
dismissing Livingston's Hawai# i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) 
Rule 40 Petition (
Second HRPP Rule 40 Petition) without a 
hearing.1 
On appeal, Livingston contends the Circuit Court 
erroneously dismissed: (1) Claim 6 because (a) Livingston's 
extended sentence was unconstitutional, and (b) there was insufficient evidence for the trial court
2 to impose the extended 
sentence (collectively, extended sentencing argument); (2) Claim 
7 because there was insufficient evidence for the trial court to 
impose a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment as a repeat

offender upon Livingston (repeat offender sentencing argument); 
(3) Claim 9 because (a) the jury instruction on the offense of 
second-degree sexual assault was deficient, and (b) the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury regarding included offenses of sexual assault in the third and fourth degrees (collectively, jury instructions argument); and (4) Claim 10 
because Livingston's counsel did not request that the jury be 
polled and because the cumulative errors require reversal.
   3
We hold that Livingston's new arguments on appeal 
challenging the repeat offender, extended term, and consecutive sentences he received are not precluded by waiver, but must still be properly raised before the Circuit Court. We vacate in part only as to these claims alleging illegal sentencing, and remand for Livingston to amend his petition to properly raise these claims before the Circuit Court. 
I. BACKGROUND 
1998 Trial Court Proceedings 
On March 30, 1998, the State charged Livingston with 
two counts of third-degree assault, two counts of first-degree 
sexual assault, one count of kidnapping, and one count of second-degree terroristic threatening (Complaint). Following a 1998 
jury trial, Livingston was found guilty as charged of two counts 
of third-degree assault, the included offense of second-degree unlawful imprisonment, and two counts of the included offenses of second-degree sexual assault. He was found not guilty of second-degree terroristic threatening. 
At the November 18, 1998 sentencing, the trial court 
heard arguments on Respondent-Appellee State of Hawai# i's (State) 
3 Livingston presented an argument regarding ineffective assistance
of counsel for the first time in his Reply Brief, which was not raised below
or in the Opening Brief. "Arguments raised for the first time in the replybrief on appeal are waived." State v. Sporik, No. CAAP-20-0000101, 2021 WL

motions for extended term sentencing under HRS § 706-662  and 
repeat offender sentencing under HRS § 706-606.5. 54
4 At the time of the offenses, the extended term sentencing statute,
HRS §§ 706-662 (Supp. 1997) pertinently provided in subsections (1) and (4) as
follows: 
Criteria for extended terms of imprisonment. A convicted 
defendant may be subject to an extended term of imprisonmentunder section 706-661, if the convicted defendant satisfiesone or more of the following criteria: 
(1) The defendant is a persistent offender whose
imprisonment for an extended term is necessary forprotection of the public. The court shall not make this finding unless the defendant has previously been convictedof two felonies committed at different times when the defendant was eighteen years of age or older. 
. . . . 
(4)
 The defendant is a multiple offender whose
criminal actions were so extensive that a sentence of imprisonment for an extended term is necessary forprotection of the public. The court shall not make this finding unless: 
(a) The defendant is being sentenced for two or
more felonies or is already under sentence of imprisonmentfor felony . . . . 
(Emphases added). 
The motion for extended term sentencing requested extended
sentencing as a "persistent offender" under subsection (1) and as a "multipleoffender" under subsection (4), on the basis that Livingston was previouslyconvicted of two felonies at different times over the age of 18, and thatLivingston was currently being sentenced for two Class B felonies of SexualAssault in the Second Degree. 
5 At the time of the offenses, HRS § 706-606.5 (Supp. 1997)
provided, in pertinent part: 
Sentencing of repeat offenders. (1) Notwithstanding section
706-669 and any other law to the contrary, any personconvicted of . . . any felony conviction of anotherjurisdiction shall be sentenced to a mandatory minimumperiod of imprisonment without possibility of parole duringsuch period as follows: 
(a) One prior felony conviction: 
. . . .

 Where the instant conviction is for
a class B felony–three years, four months

With regard to the extended sentencing argument, the 
State informed the trial court that the maximum term was eight 
years for the prior out-of-state conviction, referring to its exhibits that included the California offense statute, and certified copies of California court documents. Livingston objected on the grounds of hearsay, lack of identification, and requested an evidentiary hearing.
  6
An evidentiary hearing was then had, in which the State 
presented evidence through Jess Lopez (Lopez), Livingston's 
parole officer in California, who testified as to the nature, 
date, and case number of Livingston's California convictions, authenticated State's Exhibit 3 (certified copy of the abstract 
(6)
 For purposes of this section: 
(a) Convictions under two or more counts of an indictment or
complaint shall be considered a single conviction . . . . 
The motion for repeat offender sentencing requested sentencing
under subsection (1)(a)(iii) of HRS § 606-606.5, on the basis that Livingston
was previously convicted in California of two counts of "Forcible Rape"  on two
separate women, and that the instant offense was committed within the maximumpenalty of eight years pursuant to California Codes Sections 264.5 and theprovisions of codes sections 1170-1170.95.  
6 Defense counsel argued as follows: 
Your Honor, excuse me. I would object to the Court
accepting statements by counsel. They are hearsay --accepting documents that have not been identified or 
testified to as fair and accurate records from California. I think what is required is the State put on an evidentiary
hearing to prove you have prior convictions for purposes ofmandatory minimum sentencing. I don't think the rulesrequire the State of Hawaii to just narrate what it thinks 
it can prove. It needs to prove it beyond a reasonable
doubt. 
. . . . 
Well, your Honor, is the Court assuming those documents aredocuments that involve a conviction that my client sufferedin California, because I have not heard anything thatidentifies my client to those documents. I think that's whythe rules require an evidentiary hearing to makeidentification that my client is the person that is beingdiscussed here by documents in the State of Hawaii.

of the judgment), identified Livingston in the courtroom as his 
parolee, testified that Livingston was over eighteen at the time of the convictions, and testified as to the date Livingston's parole ended. The State introduced the records from Livingston's 
California case into evidence, as Exhibits S-1, S-2, S-3, and 
S-4.  The trial court received the State's exhibits into evidence 
over Livingston's "lack of foundation" objection.
7 
Thereafter, the trial court took judicial notice of, 
among other things, Exhibit S-1 being a complaint against 
Livingston, containing charges arising from acts against two different women, and Exhibit S-4 being a no contest plea dated November 30, 1992, detailing the acts and dates of the crimes against the two women, and establishing that Livingston was represented by counsel in the California case. The trial court granted the State's request for repeat offender sentencing under HRS § 706-606.5(1)(a)(iii), finding that Livingston qualified for a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of three years, four months based on one prior conviction and the two class B felony convictions for second-degree sexual assault. 
Next, the trial court addressed the State's motion for 
extended terms sentencing under HRS § 706-662. In opposition, Livingston argued that there was no evidence that he had two prior felony convictions, and that Livingston only had "one

conviction in 1992, albeit against two complainants . . . ."  The 
trial court agreed with the State's distinction between the 
definition of prior "conviction" under the repeat offender provision, HRS § 706-606.5(6)(a) (providing that multiple counts in a single complaint are considered a single prior conviction), and the extended term provision, HRS § 706-662(1) (providing that prior conviction means "two felonies committed at different times"). The trial court determined that for purposes of HRS § 706-662(1), "[t]here is no question here [that Livingston] has previously been convicted of two felonies committed at different times when he was eighteen years of age or older as shown by the documents admitted in evidence." The trial court found that Livingston qualified as a persistent and multiple offender under HRS § 706-662 (1) and (4), and that extended term sentencing was necessary to protect the public.
 8
8 The Circuit Court made the following oral findings regarding
extended sentencing under HRS § 706-662(1) and (4): 
THE COURT: On this extended request the Court is
going to find the Defendant here qualifies as a pers istent 
offender under 706-992(1) [ sic], as well as under (4) as a
multiple offender, so the Court finds the Defendant is a
persistent offender whose commitment for extended term isnecessary for protection of the public. There is no questionhere Defendant has previously been convicted of two feloniescommitted at different times when he was eighteen years ofage or older as shown by the documents admitted in evidence. 
Also, the Defendant is a multiple offender under
(4). Defendant is a multiple offender whose criminality wasso extensive that a sentence of imprisonment for an extendedterm is warranted. There is no question the Defendant hereis being sentenced for two former felonies, or is alreadyunder sentence of imprisonment for a felony. 
As a further finding of the Court, the Court finds
that he is a persistent offender by virtue of the fact he isnow being sentenced for two counts of sexual assault in thesecond degree, and because Defendant was also prior to the
date of the offenses herein a registered sex offender,having previously been convicted of two counts of forciblerape, one assault, one assault with  intent to commit rape,
assault with a deadly weapon, burglary in the first degreeor being felony offenses in case number C97550 in theSuperior Court ·of California, County of Orange on November
30, 1992, when he ·was eighteen years of age or older, and
that the Defendant's prior felony offenses in Case NumberC97550 were committed on three different dates against three

The trial court sentenced Livingston to extended terms 
of twenty years each for two counts of second-degree sexual 
assault, and one year each for two counts of third-degree assault and second-degree unlawful imprisonment. All terms were ordered to run consecutively for a total of forty-three years, with a mandatory minimum period of imprisonment of three years and four months without the possibility of parole as a repeat offender.
1999 Direct Appeal 
Livingston appealed from the November 18, 1998 judgment 
on January 19, 1999, contending that (1) the State's opening, 
closing, and rebuttal arguments constituted prosecutorial misconduct, and (2) the State's cross-examination of Livingston improperly bolstered the complainant's testimony.  No sentencing 
challenges were raised. On December 8, 1999, the Hawai# i Supreme 
Court affirmed the trial court's judgment. State v. Livingston, 
92 Hawai# i 634, 994 P.2d 566 (1999).
2005 First HRPP Rule 40 Petition 
On October 5, 2005, in Case No. 2PR041000021, 
Livingston filed a motion to correct illegal sentence, arguing 
that his extended term of imprisonment was improper based upon Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000).
9 The Circuit Court 
construed the motion as a HRPP Rule 40 petition (First Rule 40 
Petition), and on November 16, 2005, denied the same on the basis 
that Apprendi did not apply retroactively. Livingston did not 
appeal. 
felony offenses against the two different women were both
committed –– [Prosecutor], I see dangerous instrument. Isthat reflected in the documents you have presented? 
[PROSECUTOR]: Yes, your Honor. 
THE COURT: 
To-wit: a knife or other similar sharp
object. The Court notes again that the documents admitted in
evidence support these findings.

in penalty beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to thejury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. 530 U.S. at 476.

 2017 Second HRPP Rule 40 Petition 
On April 24, 2017, in Case No. 2PR171000006, 
Livingston, self-represented, filed the Second HRPP Rule 40 
Petition in the case underlying this appeal.  This second 
petition alleged in relevant part: 
CLAIM 6. 
Petitioner has been sentenced to an extended term 
sentence by a statute which was unconstitutional atthe time of sentencing. Further, the time in whichthe State of Hawaii sought the extended term sentencefrom the unconstitutional statute in the instant case on Petition (Cr. No. 98-0181) was beyond the timeallowed for by law. Petitioner's sentence is illegaland demands to be vacated and dismissed. 
CLAIM 7. 
Part A 
Petitioner was illegally sentenced to mandatory
minimum terms in case Cr. No. 98-0181. Circuit Court of the Second Circuit was not the trier of fact and could not solely determine Petitioner's sentencingenhancement whereby Petitioner's case was tried beforea jury. Pursuant to the United States Constitution's protections of Due Process and Equal Protection . . .Petitioner's mandatory minimum term sentencing isillegal, as is maximum term. 
Part B Illegality exists also in that Petitioner's statutory
enhancement of minimum term sentence by the non-trierof fact Hawaii Paroling Authority not only violatesHawaii Revised Statutes § 706-609; but, the abovenamed Constitutional protections of Due Process andEqual Protection. 
. . . . 
CLAIM 9
. 
The State of Hawaii violated the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution; Article 1, § 5 ofthe Hawaii Constitution; Equal Protection Clause; ResJudicata; Hawaii Rules of Professional Conduct Rule3.8; and protections against Malicious, Selectiveand/or Vindictive Prosecution in cases FC 98-0212 andCr. No. 98-0181. State has committed criminal acts pertaining falsified documents of which judicialmisconduct may be a part. Constitutional violations of this magnitude mandate automatic reversal ofPetitioner's case and dismissal with prejudice. 
CLAIM 10. 
The amount of Errors - violations of statutes,violations of rules and violations of constitutional protections, whether harmless or plain occurring in 
8  
 
 
 
   
 
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
cases FC 98-0212 and Cr. No. 98-0181 . . . amount to 
Cumulative Error. The sheer volume of error is prejudicial and mandates reversal of Petitioner's
conviction. 
(Original emphases omitted). 
On May 31, 2018, the Circuit Court dismissed 
Livingston's Second HRPP Rule 40 Petition without a hearing. In 
its FOFs, COLs, and Order, the Circuit Court found that the extended sentencing argument in Claim 6 was raised and ruled upon previously, and thus Claim 6 could not be brought pursuant to HRPP Rule 40(a)(3). With respect to the repeat offender sentencing argument in Claim 7, the Circuit Court found that it was patently frivolous and was not a colorable claim. With respect to the jury instructions argument in Claim 9, the Circuit Court found that Livingston failed to raise the issue in the underlying criminal case, on direct appeal, or in the First HRPP Rule 40 Petition, and thus Claim 9 was waived under HRPP Rule 40(a)(3). With respect to the jury poll and cumulative 
error argument in Claim 10, the Circuit Court found that the 
alleged errors were not supported by the record, thus were patently frivolous and stated no colorable claim. Based upon the 
foregoing, the Circuit Court dismissed Livingston's Second 
HRPP Rule 40 Petition without a hearing. 
Livingston timely appealed.

II. STANDARD OF REVIEW 
Whether a trial court "erred in denying a Rule 40 
petition without a hearing based on no showing of a colorable claim is reviewed de novo; thus, the right/wrong standard of review is applicable." Dan v. State, 76 Hawai# i 423, 427, 879 
P.2d 528, 532 (1994). 
As a general rule, a hearing should be held on a Rule 40
petition for post-conviction relief where the petitionstates a colorable claim. To establish a colorable claim,the allegations of the petition must show that if taken astrue the facts alleged would change the verdict, however, apetitioner's conclusions need not be regarded as true. Where 
10 On October 30, 2019, following temporary remand from this court,
the Circuit Court appointed counsel for Livingston. 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
  examination of the record of the trial court's proceedings
indicates that the petitioner's allegations show nocolorable claim, it is not error to deny the petitionwithout a hearing. The question on appeal of a denial of aRule 40 petition without a hearing is whether the trialrecord indicates that Petitioner's application for reliefmade such a showing of a colorable claim as to require ahearing before the lower court. 
Lewi v. State, 145 Hawai# i 333, 345, 452 P.3d 330, 342 (2019) 
(quoting Dan, 76 Hawai# i at 427, 879 P.2d at 532).
III. Discussion 
Livingston's opening brief sets forth four points of 
error, which contain a combination of issues raised and dismissed 
in the Second HRPP Rule 40 Petition as well as entirely new issues added on appeal. Livingston was self-represented at the trial level for this petition, but has counsel on appeal. While a self-represented petitioner "should not suffer for [their] inability to articulate [] claims," they must still "alert the court to the general issue that is the basis of [the] claim[.]" Stanley v. State, 76 Hawai# i 446, 450, 879 P.2d 551, 555 (1994) 
(citation and internal brackets omitted). 
Even liberally 
construing Livingston's HRPP Rule 40 Petition under Stanley
, 
however, the Second HRPP Rule 40 Petition did not alert the Circuit Court, and thus the Circuit Court did not consider, some of the newly raised issues in Livingston's points of error. As discussed below, some of the points of error are waived, and some are not. 
A. Claims regarding jury instructions, jury
poll, and cumulative error are waived orwithout merit. 
Livingston contends that the Circuit Court erred in 
dismissing Claim 9 because the trial court's jury instructions 
for the sexual assault offenses were erroneous and insufficient. These arguments were not raised at trial, on direct appeal, in the First HRPP Rule 40 Petition, or in the record below of the Second HRPP Rule 40 Petition, and they are waived. See HRPP 
10  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Rule 40(a)(3);11 Rapozo v. State, 150 Hawai# i 66, 86, 497 P.3d 81, 
101 (2021) (citation omitted) (holding that defendant's 
contentions were waived because they were not raised below in the Rule 40 Petition and were raised for the first time on appeal). 
Livingston contends that the Circuit Court erred in 
dismissing Claim 10 in the Second HRPP Rule 40 Petition because the "'cumulative weight of errors'" created an atmosphere of bias and prejudice, depriving Livingston of a fair trial; and because Livingston's trial counsel "did not request that the jury be polled[.]" The jury polling argument was not raised previously or in this record below, and it is waived. See HRPP Rule 
40(a)(3); Rapozo, 150 Hawai# i at 86, 497 P.3d at 101. As to the 
cumulative error argument that Livingston was deprived of a fair trial, because Livingston's claims regarding the above trial-related errors (i.e. jury instructions and jury poll) are waived, this argument is without merit; and we do not disturb the Circuit Court's rejection of this argument in Claim 10. See Dan, 
76 Hawai# i at 427, 879 P.2d at 532. 
B. Claims of illegal sentence are not waived. 
Under HRPP Rule 40(a)(3), relief is not available if an 
issue was previously ruled upon or waived. However, HRPP Rule 40(a)(3) makes an exception for a claim of "illegal sentence," which is not subject to waiver. An "illegal sentence" 
11 HRPP Rule 40(a)(3) provides: 
(3) Inapplicability. Rule 40 proceedings shall not be
available and relief thereunder shall not be granted wherethe issues sought to be raised have been previously ruledupon or were waived. Except for a claim of illegal sentence,an issue is waived if the petitioner knowingly andunderstandingly failed to raise it and it could have beenraised before the trial, at the trial, on appeal, in ahabeas corpus proceeding or any other proceeding actuallyconducted, or in a prior proceeding actually initiated underthis rule, and the petitioner is unable to prove theexistence of extraordinary circumstances to justify thepetitioner's failure to raise the issue. There is arebuttable presumption that a failure to appeal a ruling orto raise an issue is a knowing and understanding failure.

may be corrected at "any time[.]" HRPP Rule 35(a).12 In Stanley 
v. State, 148 Hawai# i 489, 502, 479 P.3d 107, 120 (2021), the 
Hawai# i Supreme Court explained: 
Thus, put simply, HRPP Rule 40 allows a petitioner to
bring a claim of illegal sentence "[a]t any time" after
final judgment, even if they failed to raise the illegalsentence claim in a previous petition; if the petitionerstates a colorable claim, they are entitled to a hearingunder HRPP Rule 40(f). 
(citing Flubacher v. State, 142 Hawai# i 109, 114 n.7, 414 P.3d 
161, 166 n.7 (2018) ("[A]ny analysis of waiver must be made in 
light of HRPP Rule 40(a)(3), which specifically exempts illegal sentence claims from being waived.")); see also Rapozo, 150 Hawai# i at 81, 83, 497 P.3d at 96, 98 ("Although Rapozo could 
have raised this claim in his previous seven HRPP Rule 40 petitions or other proceedings, as explained above, this is aclaim of illegal sentence.").  
Livingston raises a new challenge to his consecutive 
sentences on appeal, that the Circuit Court erred in dismissing the "due process" claim in Claim 9 because the trial court "abused its discretion in sentencing Livingston to consecutive sentences totaling 43 years . . . ."
13 Relying on State v. 
Vellina, 106 Hawai# i 441, 106 P.3d 364 (2005), Livingston argues 
12 HRPP Rule 35(a) provides: 
(a) Correction of Illegal Sentence. The court may correct an
illegal sentence at any time and may correct a sentenceimposed in an illegal manner within the time provided hereinfor the reduction of sentence. A motion made by a defendantto correct an illegal sentence more than 90 days after thesentence is imposed shall be made pursuant to Rule 40 ofthese rules. A motion to correct a sentence that is made within the 90 day time period shall empower the court to acton such motion even though the time period has expired. 
(Emphases added). 
13 This argument only appears in the argument section of the opening
brief, and is not raised in the points of error section as required by HRAPRule 28(b)(4). See Marvin v. Pflueger, 127 Hawai #i 490, 496, 280 P.3d 88, 94
(2012) ("Nonetheless, noncompliance with Rule 28 does not always result indismissal of the claims, and this court has consistently adhered to the policyof affording litigants the opportunity to have their cases heard on themerits, where possible.") (citation, internal quotation marks, and bracketsomitted).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that "the trial court based its sentencing decisions on 
unsubstantiated claims made by the DPA" and "the parole agent witness," and the trial court plainly erred in imposing the terms consecutively.  The consecutive sentencing challenge was not 
raised below, and the Circuit Court had no opportunity to address 
it. 
Livingston raises a new argument regarding his repeat 
offender sentence on appeal, that the Circuit Court erred by dismissing Claim 7 of the Second HRPP Rule 40 Petition because the trial court lacked sufficient evidence to impose a mandatory minimum sentence as a repeat offender under HRS § 706-606.5, based on the record of the sentencing hearing. Claim 7 as raised below, did not present this argument to the Circuit Court, but rather contended that the mandatory minimum term was a sentencing enhancement for the jury to determine as fact-finder. On appeal, Livingston argues that the four exhibits, Exhibit S-1 through S-4,
14 and the testimony of Livingston's parole officer were 
insufficient to establish that Livingston had a prior conviction to support a mandatory minimum sentence under HRS § 706-606.5. The specific challenges raised on appeal were not made below, and the Circuit Court had no opportunity to address them. 
Livingston's challenge to the extended sentence based 
on Apprendi was previously raised and rejected in the First HRPP Rule 40 Petition,
15 but he raises a new argument in this 
14 On September 20, 2006, the State withdrew Exhibits S-1, S-2, S-3,
and S-4 after filing a Request for Withdrawal of Exhibits and Receipt. The 
exhibits are not in the record. Livingston points out in his opening briefthat the State sent a ten-page PDF copy of what the State had in itspossession, however, the copy did not include the original exhibits, as therewere no evidence markers. 
Upon remand, the State should supplement the record with the
original exhibits or copies of the original exhibits, or the Circuit Courtshould make findings regarding any missing exhibits relevant to the extendedterm sentence and attempt to reconstruct them. See HRAP Rule 10(e); U.S. v.
Novaton, 271 F.3d 968, 992-93 (11th Cir. 2001) (explaining the procedure formissing exhibits under Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure 10(e)). 
15 Livingston's constitutional argument that Apprendi applied
retroactively was previously ruled upon and rejected in the First HRPP Rule 40proceeding (2PR041000021), and the Circuit Court correctly concluded thatrelief under HRPP Rule 40 was not available. See HRPP Rule 40(a)(3). We see

appeal that the Circuit Court erred in dismissing Claim 6 under 
the pre-Apprendi extended term sentencing framework of the Okumura/Huelsman cases.
16 
Livingston argues that, pursuant to the 
Okumura/Huelsman cases, "there was insufficient evidence, including lack of proof of conviction, to sentence Livingston to extended terms pursuant to HRS §§ 706-662(1) and (4)[,]" as the ordinary rules of evidence applied, and the trial court failed toenter its findings of fact and specifically state that the State's motion for extended terms sentencing was proved "beyond areasonable doubt." The extended sentencing argument based on  
 
Okumura/Huelsman was not raised below, and the Circuit Court had 
no opportunity to address it. 
Because Livingston's illegal sentencing challenges 
described above were not raised below, we vacate and remand thismatter to the Circuit Court to allow the filing of an amended petition to properly raise the challenges to Livingston's repeatoffender, extended term, and consecutive sentences before the  
 
no reason to disturb this ruling. 
The Hawai #i Supreme Court affirmed
Livingston's direct appeal on December 8, 1999, and the Judgment on Appeal was
filed on December 30, 1999, before the issuance of the Apprendi decision onJune 26, 2000. State v. Livingston, 92 Hawai #i 634, 994 P.2d 566 (1999). See 
Flubacher, 142 Hawai #i at 118, 414 P.3d at 170 (clarifying that Apprendi does
not apply retroactively to cases before Apprendi was decided on June 26,2000); State v. Gomes, 107 Hawai #i 308, 313-14, 113 P.3d 184, 189-90 (2005)
(holding that the new rule of Apprendi did not apply retroactively oncollateral review to cases where the conviction and sentence became final before Apprendi was decided). 
16 In State v. Huelsman, 60 Haw. 71, 91, 588 P.2d 394, 407 (1978),
overruled on other grounds by State v. Tafoya, 91 Hawai #i 261, 982 P.2d 890
(1999), noting the difficulty in determining whether the sentencing courtappropriately exercised its discretion within the statutory guidelines of HRS§ 706-662, the supreme court set forth the requirement that: 
"the sentencing
court shall state on the record its reasons for determining that commitment ofthe defendant for an extended term is necessary for protection of the public
and shall enter into the record all findings of fact which are necessary to
its decision." The Huelsman
 court explained that the facts proving extended
term sentencing were subject to the "ordinary rules of evidence" and had to be
proved "beyond a reasonable doubt." Id. at 77, 588 P.2d at 399.
Subsequently, in State v. Okumura, 78 Hawai #i 383, 413-14, 894 P.2d 80, 110-11
(1995), abrogated on other grounds by State v. Cabagbag, 127 Hawai #i 302, 277
P.3d 1007 (2012), the supreme court applied Huelsman and held that because thecircuit court "did not state on the record its reasons" and "did not enter anyfindings of fact," it could not determine whether the circuit court abused itsdiscretion in concluding that an extended term sentence was necessary.
