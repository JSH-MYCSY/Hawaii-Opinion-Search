Civil Rights Commission's Final Decision and Order Dated December 
12, 2017. 
Morning Hill raises a single point of error on appeal, 
contending that the Circuit Court erred in concluding that 
Hawai#i Administrative Rule (HAR
) § 12-46-133 (1990) is not 
unconstitutional on its face.2   
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve Morning Hill's point of error as follows: 
In the proceedings before the HCRC, in a March 17, 2017 
Decision and Order Granting Executive Director's First Motion for 
Summary Judgment (Order Granting MSJ), the HCRC Hearings Examiner 
concluded, inter alia, 
1) [Morning Hill's] two advertisements, one in the
shop's window and the other on [C]raigslist, are
discriminatory and violate Hawaii Revised Statutes
[(HRS)] § 378-2(a)(1)(c) and HAR § 12-46-131 and 12-46-133. 
This determination was later reiterated in the July 6, 
2017 Hearing Officer's Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and 
2 HAR § 12-46-133 provides, in relevant part: 
§ 12-46-133 Pre-employment practices.  (a) Where an
employer or other covered entity, as a part of its
recruitment process, advertises job openings through themedia, employment agencies, posting of notices, or throughother means, it is discrimination on the basis of age forthe employer to express or cause to be expressed apreference for individuals of a particular age or range ofages, unless there is a BFOQ for the position. Phrases such as "young", "college student", "girl", "boy", "recentcollege graduate", "retired person", ["]supplement yourpension", or others of a similar nature are prohibitedunless there is a BFOQ for the position.

Recommended Order, as well as the October 10, 2017 Hearing 
Officer's Amended Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and 
Recommended Order and adopted and restated in the findings and 
conclusions in the HCRC's December 12, 2017 Final Decision and Order. 
On appeal to the Circuit Court, Morning Hill did not 
challenge the finding and conclusion that its two advertisements are discriminatory and violated HRS § 378-2(a)(1)(C) (2015).  
Nor was this issue raised or argued in this secondary appeal. Therefore, any challenge to the HCRC's finding and conclusion that Morning Hill's advertisements were discriminatory and in violation of HRS § 378-2(a)(1)(C) is waived, regardless of any determination as to the constitutionality of HAR § 12-46-133. 3 
3 HRS § 378-2 provides, in relevant part: 
§ 378-2. Discriminatory practices made unlawful;
offenses defined.  (a) It shall be an unlawful
discriminatory practice: 
(1) Because of race, sex including gender identity
or expression, sexual orientation, age,religion, color, ancestry, disability, maritalstatus, arrest and court record, or domestic orsexual violence victim status if the domestic or sexual violence victim provides notice to thevictim's employer of such status or the employerhas actual knowledge of such status: 
. . . . 
(C) For any employer or employment agency toprint, circulate, or cause to be printedor circulated any statement,advertisement, or publication or to useany form of application for employment orto make any inquiry in connection withprospective employment, that expresses,directly or indirectly, any limitation,specification, or discrimination[.] 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The fundamental principles of judicial restraint and 
constitutional avoidance require that courts abstain from 
contemplating constitutional issues where such inquiry is unnecessary to dispose of the case at bar. Haw. Gov't Emps. 
Ass'n v. Lingle, 124 Hawai# i 197, 208, 239 P.3d 1, 12 (2010) 
(citing the "fundamental and longstanding principle of judicial restraint requires that courts avoid reaching constitutional questions in advance of the necessity of deciding them") (citation omitted); see also State v. Delima, 78 Hawai# i 343, 348 
n.7, 893 P.2d 194, 199 n.7 (1995) (declining to address constitutional argument where statutory grounds were sufficient for disposition); State v. Domingo, 69 Haw. 68, 70, 733 P.2d 690, 692 (1987) (standing for same proposition). Thus, as Morning Hill failed to challenge the finding and conclusion of discrimination under HRS § 378-2(a)(1)(c), we decline to reach Morning Hill's constitutional challenges to HAR § 12-46-133. 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's July 16, 2018 
Final Judgment is affirmed.
