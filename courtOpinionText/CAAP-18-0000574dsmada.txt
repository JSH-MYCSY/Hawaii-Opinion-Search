the matter would be called to the court's attention on

dismissal of the appeal, pursuant to Hawai# i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure Rule 30, and Robinson may request relief from default by motion;

temporary remand for the circuit court to approve a settlement;

December 18, 2018 motion and temporarily remanded the case to the 
circuit court for sixty days but no later than March 11, 2019. 
The court ordered that no later than March 11, 2019, if the 
circuit court approved the settlement, then Robinson or the 
parties shall file appropriate documents to dismiss the appeal; 
if additional time was needed on remand, then Robinson or the 
parties shall file a motion for extension of time; and "if

additional time on remand is filed, jurisdiction will

dismissed.
