APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 15-1-0093(2)) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Reifurth and Chan, JJ.) 
In this action for judicial foreclosure, Defendant-
Appellant James Boonstra (Boonstra) appeals from an "Order 
Denying Defendant James Boonstra's Rule 60(b)(4) Motion to Set 
Aside December 8, 2015 Decree of Foreclosure and Judgment" (Order   
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Denying Rule 60(b)(4) Motion) filed on June 20, 2018, and a 
"Judgment" (Judgment Confirming Sale) filed on June 29, 2018,1 
both entered by the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (Circuit Court).
2 
Boonstra's point of error on appeal is that the Circuit 
Court erred by denying his Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure 
(
HRCP) Rule 60(b)(4) motion for relief (Rule 60(b)(4) Motion) and 
in entering the Judgment Confirming Sale, because Plaintiff-
Appellee Nationstar Mortgage LLC (Nationstar) failed to establish 
its standing to judicially foreclose and therefore the Circuit 
Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. 
Upon careful review of the record and briefs submitted 
by the parties and having given due consideration to the arguments and issues they raise, as well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Boonstra's point of error as follows and affirm. 
Nationstar initiated this action against, inter alia
, 
Boonstra on February 26, 2015.  On September 28, 2015, Nationstar filed a motion for summary judgment and decree of foreclosure against all defendants.  Boonstra did not file a responsive pleading or opposition to Nationstar's motion for summary judgment.  On December 8, 2015, the Circuit Court entered its "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure Against all Defendants" (Order Granting Nationstar's MSJ) and a 
"Judgment on Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order 
1 The Judgment Confirming Sale was entered pursuant to an "Order
Confirming Foreclosure Sale, Approving Commissioner's Report, Allowance of
Commissioner's Fees, Attorneys' Fees, Costs, Directing Conveyance and for Writof Ejectment" ( Order Confirming Sale ), filed on June 29, 2018.  
2 The Honorable Peter T. Cahill presided. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and Decree of 
Foreclosure Against all Defendants" (Foreclosure Judgment). 
Boonstra did not appeal from the Foreclosure Judgment  
and thus the Foreclosure Judgment became final and binding. Mortg. Elec. Registration Sys., Inc. v. Wise, 130 Hawai# i 11, 17, 
304 P.3d 1192, 1198 (2013).  Under similar circumstances in Wise, the Hawai# i 
 Supreme Court held: 
[i]n the instant case, Petitioners have never legally
challenged the court's entry of the May 12, 2010 judgment offoreclosure made pursuant to the order granting Respondent's
motion for summary judgment.  As discussed supra ,
Petitioners' ultimate deadline to appeal that judgment was
July 12, 2010.  However, they did not appeal from that judgment.  Hence, the May 12, 2010 judgment became final and binding.  As stated before, the foreclosure judgment"determined the merits of the controversy," renderingsubsequent proceedings "incident[ ] to its enforcement."  MDG Supply [,Inc. v. Diversified Invs., Inc.], 51 Haw.[375,] 380, 463 P.2d [525,] 528 [(1969)]. 
Id.  The Hawai# i Supreme Court further held: 
we conclude that res judicata would preclude Petitionersfrom challenging Respondent's standing in their appeal fromthe order confirming sale, despite the general propositionthat a lack of standing may be raised at any time.  Under the doctrine of res judicata, challenges to Respondent'sstanding were subsumed under the foreclosure judgment, whichhad became final and binding. 
. . . . "Res judicata . . . limit[s] a litigant to one opportunity
to litigate aspects of the case to prevent inconsistentresults and multiplicity of suits and to promote finalityand judicial economy." [E. Sav. Bank, FSB v.] Esteban, 129Hawai #i [154,] 158, 296 P.3d [1062,] 1067 [(2013)].  The 
doctrine prohibits parties from "relitigating a previouslyadjudicated cause of action."  Id. at 159, 296 P.3d at 1067(quoting Bremer v. Weeks, 104 Hawai #i
 43, 54, 85 P.3d 150, 
161 (2004)). 
As explained supra , foreclosure cases are bifurcated into
two appealable parts. Due to their bifurcated nature,
mortgage foreclosure proceedings may be treated as analogousto two separate proceedings for res judicata purposes. 
Id. 
Here, on December 11, 2017, more than two years after 
the Foreclosure Judgment had been entered and no appeal therefrom 
having been filed, Nationstar filed its motion to confirm sale.  
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On January 17, 2018, Boonstra filed his opposition to 
Nationstar's motion to confirm sale, arguing, inter alia, that Nationstar had failed to establish its standing to foreclosure under Bank of America, N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai# i 361, 390 
P.3d 1248 (2017).  On April 30, 2018, Boonstra filed a Rule 60(b)(4) Motion seeking to set aside the December 8, 2015 Foreclosure Judgment and in opposition to Nationstar's motion to confirm sale, again arguing, 
inter alia, that Nationstar lacked 
standing under Reyes-Toledo.  
On May 16, 2018, the Circuit Court orally denied 
Boonstra's Rule 60(b)(4) Motion and granted Nationstar's motion to confirm sale.  The Circuit Court entered its Order Denying Rule 60(b)(4) Motion on June 20, 2018 and its Order Confirming Sale and accompanying Judgment Confirming Sale on June 29, 2018. 
As noted above, Boonstra continues to assert that 
Nationstar failed to establish its standing to initiate this action under Reyes-Toledo.  However, given the rulings in Wise, Boonstra's failure to appeal from the Foreclosure Judgment barred his challenges to Nationstar's standing under the doctrine of 
res 
judicata.  Wise, 130 Hawai# i at 17, 304 P.3d at 1198.
 Finally, Boonstra cannot rely on HRCP Rule 60(b)(4) to 
resurrect his argument that Nationstar lacked standing.  See Nationstar Mortg. LLC v. Akepa Properties LLC, Nos. CAAP-15-0000407 and CAAP-15-0000727, 2017 WL 1401468 (Hawai# i App. Apr. 
19, 2017) (SDO); Bank of America, N.A. v. Panzo, Nos. CAAP-14-0001356 and CAAP-15-0000660, 2017 WL 1194002 (
Hawai# i App. Mar. 
31, 2017) (SDO), reconsideration denied, Nos. CAAP-14-0001356 and CAAP-15-0000660, 2017 WL 1753390 (Hawai# i App. May 4, 2017), 
cert. denied, SCWC-14-0001356, 2017 WL 4837872 (Oct. 26, 2017).  
Therefore, we affirm the following that were entered by 
the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit:
