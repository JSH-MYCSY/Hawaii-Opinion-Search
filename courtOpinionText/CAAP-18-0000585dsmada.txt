IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, 
v. 
BRIENNE ANUHEA ARMITAGE,  Defendant/Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 5FFC-18-164) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Reifurth and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record in appellate court case 
number CAAP-18-0000585, it appears that we lack appellate 
jurisdiction over this appeal by self-represented Defendant-
Appellant Brienne Armitage (Armitage), from Plaintiff-Appellee 
State of Hawaii's June 22, 2018 complaint against Armitage for 
abuse of a household or family member in violation of Hawaii 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 709-906 (2014 & Supp. 2018) in family 
court case number 5FFC-18-0000164.  Therefore dismissal for lack 
of appellate jurisdiction is warranted. 
"The right of appeal in a criminal case is purely 
statutory[.]"  State v. Nicol, 140 
Hawai# i 482, 485, 403 P.3d 
259, 262 (2017) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The Hawai
#i Intermediate Court of Appeals has jurisdiction "[t]o 
hear and determine appeals from any court or agency when appeals NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
are allowed by law[.]"  HRS § 602-57(1) (2016).  HRS § 571-54 
(2018) provides in part: 
An interested party, aggrieved by any order or decree
of the court, may appeal to the intermediate appellate court
for review of questions of law and fact upon the same termsand conditions as in other cases in the circuit court, andreview shall be governed by chapter 602, except ashereinafter provided. 
(Emphasis added).  The law that governs the terms and conditions 
of appeals from circuit court criminal cases is HRS § 641-11 
(2016), which provides in part that "[a]ny party aggrieved by the 
judgment of a circuit court in a criminal matter may appeal to 
the intermediate appellate court, subject to chapter 602, in the 
manner and within the time provided by the rules of court.  The 
sentence of the court in a criminal case shall be the judgment."  
Where "[t]here [is] no conviction and sentence in . . . 
[a] case, there can be no appeal under HRS § 641-11[.]"  State v. 
Kealaiki, 95 Hawai‘i 309, 312, 22 P.3d 588, 591 (2001) (internal 
quotation marks and citations omitted); State v. Johnston, 63 
Haw. 9, 11, 619 P.2d 1076, 1077 (1980) (Dismissing an appeal for 
lack of appellate jurisdiction where a defendant had filed a 
notice of appeal from an order denying the defendant's motion to 
dismiss an indictment, even though the circuit court later 
entered a judgment with a sentence, because "such an order is 
interlocutory and is not a final order or judgment.  It is 
therefore not one that is appealable under HRS § 641-11.").  In 
determining whether an order or judgment qualifies for 
appealability under HRS § 641-11, the Supreme Court of Hawai# i 
has recently "focused the inquiry on whether the relevant order terminated the proceedings in the case and left nothing further 
to be accomplished by the lower court."  Nicol, 140 Hawai# i at 
492, 403 P.3d at 269.  Despite that HRS § 641-11 appears to require a sentence to perfect an aggrieved party's right to 
appeal, the Nicol court held that "HRS § 641-11 authorizes a 
defendant's appeal in a criminal matter from a circuit court 
order dismissing the proceedings without prejudice."  Id. at 494, 
403 P.3d at 271 (footnote omitted).  At the time when Armitage 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
filed her July 23, 2018 notice of appeal, the family had not held 
a trial, much less announced or entered any final decision on the 
State's criminal complaint against Armitage in family court case 
number 5FFC-18-0000164. 
Granted, more than eight months later, on April 9, 
2019, the family court entered an order dismissing the State's 
case without prejudice, which was an appealable final order under 
the holding in Nicol.  Rule 4(b)(4) of the Hawai# i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) provides that "[a] notice of appeal filed after the announcement of a decision, sentence or order but 
before entry of the judgment or order shall be deemed to have 
been filed on the date such judgment or order is entered." 
(Emphasis added).  Here, at the time when Armitage filed her 
July 23, 2018 notice of appeal, the family court had not yet 
announced any appealable final decision in the underlying case. 
In order for a defendant to invoke HRAP Rule 4(b)(4) for a 
premature notice of appeal, at the time when the defendant files 
the premature notice of appeal, the trial court must have already 
announced a decision, sentence or order that will be appealable 
and final when the trial court reduces that announcement to a 
written judgment or written order. 
For example, in a premature appeal from an underlying 
proceeding for a criminal defendant's petition for post-
conviction relief pursuant to Rule 40 of the Hawaii Rules of 
Penal Procedure (HRPP), the Supreme Court of 
Hawai# i held that, 
where a party filed his notice of appeal before the trial court's announcement of its final decision, that premature notice of 
appeal was a legal nullity that had no legal effect with respect 
to the written appealable final order that the trial court later 
entered: 
Grattafiori filed his notice of appeal three weeks
before the circuit court entered its order denying his
amended second HRPP Rule 40 petition. Nothing in the recordindicates that the circuit court had entered any order (onOctober 15, 1993 or at any other time) prior to January 21,1994, the date on which Grattafiori filed his notice ofappeal. Similarly, the record does not reflect that the
circuit court announced its decision before that date, so as 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to enable Grattafiori's notice of appeal from the oral
decision to be treated as an appeal from the subsequentlyfiled order. Thus, we must conclude that Grattafiori'snotice of appeal, dated January 21, 1994, has no legaleffect, insofar as there is no jurisdictional basis uponwhich to file an appeal from an order that has not yet beenannounced or entered. See HRS § 641-11 (Supp.1992); HRPP40(h); HRAP Rule 4(b).
We have, on a number of occasions, recognized
exceptions to the requirement that notices of appeal betimely filed. See State v. Caraballo, 62 Haw. 309, 315-316,615 P.2d 91, 96 (1980) (summarizing prior cases thatrecognized such exceptions). However, we have never beenasked to forgive untimely appeals filed before theannouncement of an oral decision subsequently ripening intoan appealable written order. Specifically, we have permittedbelated appeals under two sets of circumstances, namely,when (1) defense counsel has inexcusably or ineffectivelyfailed to pursue a defendant's appeal from a criminalconviction in the first instance, or (2) the lower court'sdecision was unannounced and no notice of the entry ofjudgment was ever provided. Id. Clearly, neither of theseexceptions applies to the facts presented herein.
We hold, therefore, that Grattafiori's January 21,
1994 notice of appeal constitutes a legal nullity because,at the time of filing, there was neither an oral decisionnor a written order from which to appeal. While we treat anappeal as timely where a defendant has filed his or hernotice of appeal after the court has announced an oraldecision but before the entry of a written order orjudgment, see HRAP 4(b), we cannot do so where the court hasrendered no decision whatsoever. After the circuit court entered its written order on February 14, 1994, denying theamended second HRPP Rule 40 petition, Grattafiori wasentitled under HRAP 4(b) to thirty days within which to filea new notice of appeal. He failed to do so. Consequently, weare without jurisdiction to address the merits ofGrattafiori's appeal.
III. CONCLUSION 
Based on the foregoing, we dismiss Grattafiori's
appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
Grattafiori v. State, 79 Hawai# i 10, 13-14, 897 P.2d 937, 940-41 
(1995) (emphases added). 
Similarly in the instant case, Armitage filed her 
July 23, 2018 notice of appeal before the family court orally 
announced any final decision that could be appealable. 
Therefore, like the Grattafiori court, we are without 
jurisdiction to address the merits of Armitage's appeal.
