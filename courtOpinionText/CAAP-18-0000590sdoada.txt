v. 
STARWOOD HOTELS AND RESORTS WORLDWIDE, INC.,
Employer-Appellee-Appellee,
and

EDGWICK CMS – HAWAII,
Insurance Carrier-Appellee-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD 
(CASE NO. AB 2015-055(K)(S)) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Self-represented Claimant-Appellant-Appellant 
Raymond V. Rames
 appeals from the "Order Denying Claimant's 
Motion for Temporary Remand" entered by the Labor and Industrial 
Relations Appeals Board (LIRAB) on June 19, 2018.  For the 
reasons explained below, we affirm. 1
On September 14, 2007, Rames was injured while working 
for Employer-Appellee-Appellee Starwood Hotels and Resorts 
Worldwide, Inc. He received workers compensation benefits from 
Starwood. His health care provider returned him to full duty status with no limitations on May 26, 2008. 
1 The June 19, 2018 order was interlocutory, but became eligible for
appellate review when LIRAB entered its June 26, 2018 "Decision and Order[.]"
See Order Denying October 4, 2018 Motion to Dismiss Appeal for Lack ofAppellate Jurisdiction (Dec. 11, 2018). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Rames was also injured on September 6, 2008, while 
working for Starwood. The State of Hawai# i Department of Labor 
and Industrial Relations Disability Compensation Division (
DCD) 
found that Rames sustained a new injury on September 6, 2008, and 
denied Rames' request to reopen the claim for his September 14, 2007 injury. 
The record indicates that Rames was also injured while 
working on March 24, 2008, and on April 18, 2010; the record does not indicate whether Rames received workers compensation benefits for either injury. 
On November 9, 2012, the Family Court of the Fifth 
Circuit issued a garnishee order to Starwood for funds owed to Rames to satisfy a judgment for unpaid child support. On January 23, 2015, DCD ordered that Starwood comply with the garnishee order.
2 Rames appealed.3 On May 3, 2017, LIRAB issued 
an order stating that "[t]he sole issue to be determined is . . . [w]hether [Starwood] shall comply with the Garnishee Order[.]" 
On November 24, 2017, Rames applied to DCD for a 
hearing on "whether I am permanently totally disabled as a result of injuries caused by my work accidents which occurred on 9/14/2007, 3/24/2008, 9/6/2008, and 4/18/2010." By letter dated April 24, 2018, Rames asked DCD to set a hearing on his November 24, 2017 request. By letter dated April 27, 2018, DCD informed Rames that it was unable to set a hearing because his case was on appeal to LIRAB. 
By letter dated May 23, 2018, Rames asked LIRAB to 
remand his case "to Kauai DCD Office[.]" No reason was given for the requested remand. LIRAB issued the "Order Denying Claimant's Motion for Temporary Remand" on June 19, 2018. 
2 An amended decision was issued on January 28, 2015, to correct the
name of Starwood's insurance carrier. 
3 It appears that Starwood satisfied the garnishee order because a
release of garnishee was filed in the family court on July 13, 2015.
Starwood's counsel explained that Starwood paid the garnishee order becausethere was no stay of the DCD's January 23, 2015 decision. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On June 26, 2018, LIRAB issued a "Decision and Order" 
affirming the DCD's January 23, 2015 decision ordering that 
Starwood comply with the garnishee summons. 
This appeal followed.4 
"Appellate review of a LIRAB decision is governed by 
HRS [Hawaii Revised Statutes] § 91-14(g)." Botelho v. Atlas 
Recycling Ctr., 146 Hawai# i 435, 442, 463 P.3d 1092, 1099 (2020) 
(cleaned up). HRS § 91–14(g) (2012 & Supp. 2016) provides: 
Upon review of the record the court may affirm the
decision of the agency or remand the case withinstructions for further proceedings; or it mayreverse or modify the decision and order if thesubstantial rights of the petitioners may have beenprejudiced because the administrative findings,conclusions, decisions, or orders are: 
(1) In violation of constitutional or statutory
provisions; 
(2) In excess of the statutory authority orjurisdiction of the agency; 
(3) Made upon unlawful procedure; 
(4) Affected by other error of law; 
(5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,probative, and substantial evidence on the wholerecord; or 
(6) Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized byabuse of discretion or clearly unwarrantedexercise of discretion. 
Rames challenges the June 19, 2018 order denying his 
request for a remand to DCD. Hawaii Administrative Rules § 12-
47-24(a) applies to remands. It provides: 
[LIRAB] may issue an order remanding any proceeding: 
(1) For determination of an issue not decided by the
[DCD]; or 
4 Rames's opening brief does not comply with Rule 28(b) of the
Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure. Nevertheless, the Hawai #i  Supreme Court
instructs that to promote access to justice, pleadings prepared by self-represented litigants should be interpreted liberally, and self-representedlitigants should not automatically be foreclosed from appellate review becausethey fail to comply with court rules. Erum v. Llego, 147 Hawai #i 368, 380-81,
465 P.3d 815, 827-28 (2020).

(2) For such other action by the [DCD] as may serve the
interests of the just, speedy, and inexpensivedetermination of the appeal. 
(Emphasis added.) Accordingly, we review LIRAB's order for abuse
of discretion. Our review is also "qualified by the principle that the agency's decision carries a presumption of validity and appellant has the heavy burden of making a convincing showing  
that the decision is invalid[.]" Keep the N. Shore Country v. 
Bd. of Land & Nat. Res., 150 Hawai# i 486, 503, 506 P.3d 150, 167 
(2022) (citations omitted). 
Rames contends that LIRAB should have remanded the case 
concerning Rames's September 14, 2007 injury to DCD "to coreect [sic] changes in Rames [sic] physical condition such as may be shown by his doctor's recent medical report, which would demonstrate that he is now permanently and totally disabled." The only authority cited by Rames is HRS § 386-89,  which gives

5 HRS § 386-89 (2015) provides: 
Reopening of cases; continuing jurisdiction of director . 
(a) In the absence of an appeal and within twenty
days after a copy of the decision has been sent to each
party, the director of labor and industrial relations mayupon the director's own motion or upon the application ofany party reopen a case to permit the introduction of newlydiscovered evidence, and may render a revised decision. 
(b) The director may at any time, either of the
director's own motion or upon the application of any party,reopen any case on the ground that fraud has been practicedon the director or on any party and render such decision asis proper under the circumstances. 
(c) On the application of any party in interest,
supported by a showing of substantial evidence, on theground of a change in or of a mistake in a determination offact related to the physical condition of the injuredemployee, the director may, at any time prior to eight yearsafter date of the last payment of compensation, whether ornot a decision awarding compensation has been issued, or atany time prior to eight years after the rejection of aclaim, review a compensation case and issue a decision whichmay award, terminate, continue, reinstate, increase, ordecrease compensation. No compensation case may be reviewedoftener than once in six months and no case in which a claim has been rejected shall be reviewed more than once if onsuch review the claim is again rejected. The decision shall not affect any compensation previously paid, except that anincrease of the compensation may be made effective from the

the director of labor and industrial relations authority to 
reopen a workers compensation case under certain conditions, and subject to certain limitations. The issue Rames sought to remand — whether his temporary total disabiltiy rating should be converted to a permanent total disability rating — was not before LIRAB in Rames's appeal from the DCD's order that Starwood comply with the garnishee summons. Under these circumstances we cannot conclude that LIRAB abused its discretion by denying Rames's request for a remand.

Denying Claimant's Motion for Temporary Remand" entered on June 19, 2018.

date of the injury, and if any part of the compensation dueor to become due is unpaid, a decrease of the compensationmay be made effective from the date of the injury, and anypayment made prior thereto in excess of such decreasedcompensation shall be deducted from any unpaid compensationin such manner and by such method as may be determined bythe director. In the event any such decision increases thecompensation in a case where the employee has receiveddamages from a third party pursuant to section 386-8 inexcess of compensation previously awarded, the amount ofsuch excess shall constitute a pro tanto satisfaction of theamount of the additional compensation awarded. 
This 
subsection shall not apply when the employer's liability forcompensation has been discharged in whole by the payment ofa lump sum in accordance with section 386-54 [(concerningcommutation of periodic payments)]. 
6 We express no opinion about whether Rames is entitled to reopen
the DCD proceeding for his 2007 work injury claim under HRS § 386-89.
