APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CRIMINAL NO. 1CPC-17-0001118) 
MEMORANDUM OPINION 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Chan and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Susan E. Shaw (Shaw) appeals from 
the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence (Judgment), entered on 
July 11, 2018, in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit
court).  Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai# i (State) charged 
Shaw by indictment with one count of Computer Fraud in the Third Degree (Computer Fraud 3), in violation of Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS) § 708-891.6 (2014),  and one count of Fraudulent

[§708-891.6]   Co mputer  fraud  in  the  third  degree.   (1)  A 
person  commits  the  offense  of  computer  fraud  in  the  third
degree  if  the  person  knowingly  accesses  a  computer,  computer

Use of a Credit Card (Credit Card Fraud), in violation of HRS 
§ 708-8100(1)(c) (2014).  The Judgment reflects that Shaw was 
ultimately convicted of both counts as charged. 3
As explained below, we conclude that the plain language
of HRS § 708-8100(2) does not allow the offense of Credit Card Fraud to be prosecuted as a class C felony based on an 
aggregation of the values of multiple transactions involving more
than one credit card or credit card number. Shaw's conviction 
for Credit Card Fraud in Count II must therefore be vacated and  
 
(2) Computer fraud in the third degree is a class C
felony. 
The offense of Theft in the Third Degree (Theft 3) is defined by HRS
§ 708-832 (Supp. 2016), which provides, in relevant part: 
§708-832 Theft in the third degree. (1) A person
commits the offense of theft in the third degree if the person
commits theft: 
(a) Of property or services the value of which exceeds$250[.] 
HRS § 708-830 (2014) provides, in relevant part: "A person commits
theft if the person . . . : (1) Obtains or exerts unauthorized control overproperty. A person obtains or exerts unauthorized control over the property ofanother with intent to deprive the other of the property." 
3 HRS § 708-8100 provides, in relevant part: 
§708-8100 Fraudulent use of a credit card. (1) A
person commits the offense of fraudulent use of a credit card,if with intent to defraud the issuer, or another person ororganization providing money, goods, services, or anythingelse of value, or any other person, the person: 
(
c) Uses or attempts or conspires to use a credit cardnumber without the consent of the cardholder for the purpose of obtaining money, goods, services,or anything else of value. 
(2) Fraudulent use of a credit card is a class C felony
if the value of all money, goods, services, and other thingsof value obtained or attempted to be obtained exceeds $300 inany six-month period. For purposes of this section, eachseparate use of a credit card that exceeds $300 constitutes aseparate offense. 
(3) Fraudulent use of a credit card is a misdemeanor, if
the value of all money, goods, services, and other things ofvalue obtained or attempted to be obtained does not exceed$300 in any six-month period. 
2         
     NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the circuit court erred in failing to dismiss Count II for lack 
of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause. We further 
conclude that, under the post-conviction liberal construction 
standard, the Indictment sufficiently charged Shaw in Count I 
with Computer Fraud 3 based on an aggregation of the values of 
multiple transactions involving multiple credit cards, even 
without expressly alleging that Shaw engaged in a scheme or 
course of conduct. However, the circuit court erred in failing 
to submit to the jury the factual question of whether the 
evidence disclosed one general intent or separate and distinct 
intents. Accordingly, this case must be remanded for a new trial 
on Count I. 
I. BACKGROUND 
A. Charges 
The charges arise from allegations that, over the 
course of four months between January 16, 2017, through and 
including May 18, 2017, Shaw falsely inflated the tip amounts of 
105 customers' bills at Square Barrels, the restaurant where Shaw 
worked as a server.4 Over the course of the four months, Shaw 
was alleged to have falsely inflated tips totaling over $700. 
On August 15, 2017, the State charged Shaw by 
Indictment, as follows: 
COUNT I: On or about January 16, 2017, through and
including May 18, 2017, in the City and County of Honolulu,
State of Hawaii, Susan E. Shaw, did knowingly access acomputer, computer system, or computer network with theintent to commit the offense of theft in the third degree,thereby committing the offense of Computer Fraud in theThird Degree in violation of Section 708-891.6 of the HawaiiRevised Statutes. 
A person commits the offense of theft in the third
degree if she intentionally obtains and exerts unauthorizedcontrol over property of another, the value of which exceedsTwo Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($250.00), with intent todeprive the other of property valued in excess of TwoHundred and Fifty Dollars ($250.00). Sections 708-832(1)(a)and 708-830(1) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes. (HPD ReportNumber 17189819-002). Count I relates to the access and use 
4 The terms "server" and "waitress" are used interchangeably to
reflect their usage during the proceedings. 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of a computer, to wit a "point of sale computer terminal",
with intent [to] commit theft of money valued in excess of$250.00, and the defendant did, in fact, so obtain moneyvalued in excess of $250.00. 
COUNT II: On or about January 16, 2017, through and
including May 18, 2017, in the City and County of Honolulu,State of Hawaii, Susan E. Shaw, with intent to defraud theissuer, or another person or organization providing money,services, or anything of value, or any other person, did usecredit card numbers without the consent of the cardholders for [the] purpose of obtaining money, or anything else ofvalue, and the value of all money and other things of valueso obtained exceeded Three Hundred Dollars ($300.00) in anysix-month period, thereby committing the offense ofFraudulent Use of Credit Card, in violation of Sections 708-8100(1)(c) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes. (HPD ReportNumber 17-189819-003). 
Count II relates to the use of 
credit card numbers, without the cardholders' consent, forthe purpose of obtaining money valued in excess of $300.00during the time period specified herein, a period of lessthan six months, and the defendant did, in fact, so obtainmoney valued in excess of $300.00. 
B. Pre-Trial Motion to Dismiss 
On November 3, 2017, Shaw filed "Defendant's Motion to 
Dismiss with Prejudice" (Motion to Dismiss), arguing that the 
State failed to adduce sufficient evidence to establish probable 
cause for either of the two counts at the grand jury proceedings. 
As to Count I, the Computer Fraud 3 charge, Shaw argued that the 
State failed to adduce sufficient evidence: (1) that Shaw used a 
computer to steal more than $250 from a single victim; (2) that 
the device Shaw used to process the tips was a "computer," as 
defined by HRS § 708-890 (2014); and (3) that Shaw lacked 
authorization. As to Count II, the Credit Card Fraud charge, 
Shaw argued that the State failed to adduce sufficient evidence: 
(1) that Shaw used a single credit card number without the 
cardholder's consent to defraud the bank that issued the card of 
more than $300; and (2) establishing lack of consent from the 
cardholders. Shaw also argued that the State failed to adduce 
evidence that Shaw acted pursuant to a single scheme or course of 
conduct. As the basis for these arguments, Shaw argued that 
Computer Fraud 3 could only be prosecuted based on a single 
victim of theft and Credit Card Fraud could only be prosecuted 
4       NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
based on the use of a single credit card or credit card number 
and a single credit card victim. 
The circuit court held a hearing on November 22, 2017, 
at which it orally denied the motion, finding that "there was 
overwhelming evidence to support the indictment against the 
defendant based on [witness testimony] and the exhibits presented 
to the grand jury." The circuit court subsequently filed its 
written Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying 
Defendant's Motion to Dismiss with Prejudice on December 15, 
2017. 
C. Trial 
At trial, the State called three witnesses: Anastasia 
Bryant (Bryant)5, Chris Duque (Duque), and Thomas Ray (Ray). 
Bryant testified that she was a customer at Square Barrels on 
May 9, 2017. She identified Shaw as her server. After 
discovering that the credit card she used to pay for her bill was 
charged $10 more than the amount she had written on her copy of 
the receipt, Bryant reported the discrepancy to Square Barrels 
management. Duque was an investigator with the Honolulu 
Prosecutor's office who testified as an expert in the areas of 
computer forensics as well as computer identification and 
examination. Duque testified about his examination of the 
restaurant's computer system and network as part of the State's 
investigation into this case. Ray was the co-owner of Square 
Barrels. Ray testified about Shaw's employment and the nature of 
the restaurant's operations. Ray also testified about the 
internal audit he and his business partner conducted of every 
employee's server accountability reports, spurred by Bryant's 
report of the discrepancy with her transaction. 
Shaw was the only witness for the defense. The circuit court's instructions to the jury included, 
inter alia, instructions on the elements of Computer Fraud 3 and 
5 Bryant was formerly known as Anastasia Vidinha. 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Credit Card Fraud, and an instruction on the definition of an 
"inference" and its use with regard to determining lack of 
consent. 
The jury found Shaw guilty as charged in both counts. 
At the sentencing hearing, the State asserted that the two counts 
merged and, as such, requested that the circuit court only 
proceed in sentencing on the count for Computer Fraud 3 and take 
no further action on the count for Credit Card Fraud. Defense 
counsel agreed that the two counts merged. Despite both parties 
conceding that the two counts merged, neither party requested a 
dismissal of Count II, nor did the circuit court enter such an 
order. 
The circuit court entered its Judgment on July 11, 
2018. The Judgment provided: 
DEFENDANT IS CONVICTED AND FOUND GUILTY OF: 
CT. 1: COMPUTER FRAUD IN THE THIRD DEGREE 
CT. 2: FRAUDULENT USE OF CREDIT CARD 
FINAL JUDGMENT AND SENTENCE OF THE COURT: COUNT 1: IMPRISONMENT TERM OF FIVE (5) YEARS to run
concurrent with any other term now serving; Mittimus toissue forthwith;MONETARY ASSESSMENT OF $500.00 OR THE ACTUAL COST OF THE DNA ANALYSIS, WHICHEVER IS LESS TO THE DNAREGISTRY SPECIAL FUND;PROVIDE BUCCAL SWAB SAMPLES AND PRINT IMPRESSIONS OF EACH HAND, AND IF REQUIRED BY THE COLLECTING AGENCY'SRULES OR INTERNAL REGULATIONS BLOOD SPECIMENS REQUIREDFOR LAW ENFORCEMENT IDENTIFICATION ANALYSIS. 
COUNT 2: STATE REQUESTED TO TAKE NO FURTHER ACTION;
GRANTED BY THE COURT. 
II. POINTS OF ERROR 
On appeal, Shaw raises six points of error: (1) the 
Indictment was fatally defective for failing to allege that Shaw 
acted pursuant to a scheme or continuing course of conduct; (2) 
the circuit court erred in denying Shaw's Motion to Dismiss with 
Prejudice; (3) the circuit court failed to properly instruct the 
jury; (4) there was insufficient evidence to sustain Shaw's 
convictions; (5) the circuit court erred in admitting unsworn 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
hearsay evidence; and (6) the circuit court's evidentiary errors 
individually and cumulatively violated Shaw's rights to due 
process and a fair trial. 
III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A. Sufficiency of the Indictment 
"Whether a charge sets forth all the essential elements 
of a charged offense . . . is a question of law, which we review 
under the de novo, or right/wrong, standard." State v. Mita, 124 
Hawai# i 385, 389, 245 P.3d 458, 462 (2010) (citation, internal 
quotation marks, and brackets omitted). 
B. Motion to Dismiss Indictment 
We review de novo a circuit court's order denying a 
motion to dismiss an indictment based on sufficiency of the 
evidence to support the indictment. State v. Taylor, 126 Hawai# i 
205, 215, 269 P.3d 740, 750 (2011). 
In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to establish
probable cause before the grand jury, every legitimateinference that may be drawn from the evidence must be drawnin favor of the indictment and neither the trial court nor the appellate court on review may substitute its judgment asto the weight of the evidence for that of the Grand Jury.The evidence to support an indictment need not be sufficientto support a conviction. 
Id. (quoting State v. Ganal, 81 Hawai# i 358, 367, 917 P.2d 370, 
379 (1996)). 
C. Jury Instructions 
When jury instructions are at issue on appeal, the 
standard of review is whether, when read and considered as a 
whole, the instructions given are prejudicially insufficient, 
erroneous, inconsistent, or misleading. State v. Metcalfe, 129 
Hawai# i 206, 222, 297 P.3d 1062, 1078 (2013) (citation omitted). 
"Erroneous instructions are presumptively harmful and are a 
ground for reversal unless it affirmatively appears from the 
record as a whole that the error was not prejudicial." Id. 
(citation omitted); see also State v. Nichols, 111 Hawai# i 327, 
337, 141 P.3d 974, 984 (2006) ("[O]nce instructional error is 
7  
        
            
             
            NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
demonstrated, we will vacate, without regard to whether timely 
objection was made, if there is a reasonable possibility that the 
error contributed to the defendant's conviction[.]"). 
D. Sufficiency of Evidence 
In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we must 
view the evidence in the light most favorable to the State. 
State v. Ildefonso, 72 Haw. 573, 576, 827 P.2d 648, 651 (1992). 
"The test on appeal is not whether guilt [was] established beyond 
a reasonable doubt, but whether there was substantial evidence to 
support the conclusion of the trier of fact." State v. Eastman, 
81 Hawai# i 131, 135, 913 P.2d 57, 61 (1996). "'Substantial 
evidence' . . . is credible evidence which is of sufficient 
quality and probative value to enable a man of reasonable caution 
to reach a conclusion." State v. Naeole, 62 Haw. 563, 565, 617 
P.2d 820, 823 (1980). 
E. Admissibility of Evidence 
[D]ifferent standards of review must be applied to trial
court decisions regarding the admissibility of evidence,depending on the requirements of the particular rule ofevidence at issue. When application of a particularevidentiary rule can yield only one correct result, theproper standard for appellate review is the right/wrongstandard. However, the traditional abuse of discretionstandard should be applied in the case of those rules ofevidence that require a "judgment call" on the part of thetrial court. 
Kealoha v. Cty. of Hawaii, 74 Haw. 308, 319, 844 P.2d 670, 676 
(1993). 
IV. DISCUSSION 
A. Sufficiency of the Indictment 
Shaw argues that, where the Computer Fraud 3 and Credit 
Card Fraud charges were based on an aggregation of multiple 
transactions pursuant to HRS § 708-801(6),6 the State was 
required to allege in the Indictment that Shaw intentionally 
6 HRS § 708-801(6) (2014) provides, in relevant part: "Amounts
involved in thefts committed pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct , whether
the property taken be of one person or several persons, may be aggregated in
determining the class or grade of the offense." (Emphasis added.) 
8          
         NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
engaged in a scheme or criminal course of conduct to commit theft 
and credit card fraud. Shaw contends that a scheme or course of 
conduct was an essential fact or required element of the charges 
and its inclusion in the Indictment was required to provide Shaw 
with adequate notice and to fully inform Shaw of the nature and 
cause of the charges brought against her. Thus, Shaw argues that 
the failure to allege a scheme or course of conduct caused the 
Indictment to be fatally defective. Shaw argues that the State's 
aggregation of 105 separate credit card transactions and failure 
to allege a scheme or course of conduct violated her right to due 
process, as it relieved the State of its burden to call 105 
witnesses and deprived Shaw of her right to confront the 105 
witnesses. 
Shaw concedes that she challenges the sufficiency of 
the Indictment for the first time on appeal. As such, we apply 
the Motta7/Wells8 post-conviction liberal construction rule: 
Under the Motta/Wells post-conviction liberal construction
rule, we liberally construe charges challenged for the firsttime on appeal. Under this approach, there is a presumptionof validity for charges challenged subsequent to aconviction. In those circumstances, this court will notreverse a conviction based upon a defective indictment orcomplaint unless the defendant can show prejudice or thatthe indictment or complaint cannot within reason beconstrued to charge a crime. 
State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai# i 383, 399-400, 219 P.3d 1170, 1186-
87 (2009) (citations, internal quotation marks, and brackets 
omitted). 
1. Count I (Computer Fraud 3) was legally sufficient under
the Motta/Wells Rule. 
We first look at whether Count I can be reasonably 
construed to charge the offense of Computer Fraud 3. "A 
complaint, for example, cannot reasonably be construed to charge 
an offense if it omits an element of the offense or when the 
7 State v. Motta , 66 Haw. 89, 657 P.2d 1019 (1983).

9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
common definition of an element of an offense set forth in the 
charge does not comport with its statutory definition." State v. 
Baker, No. SCWC-18-0000454, 2020 WL 1228443, at *7 (Haw. Mar. 13, 2020) (citing State v. Pacquing, 139 Hawai# i 302, 308, 389 P.3d 
897, 903 (2016), and Wheeler, 121 Hawai# i at 394, 219 P.3d at 
1181). The supreme court has recognized that "one 'way in which 
an otherwise deficient count can be reasonably construed to 
charge a crime is by examination of the charge as a whole.'" 
State v. Tominiko
, 126 Hawai# i 68, 76, 266 P.3d 1122, 1130 (2011) 
(quoting State v. Elliott, 77 Hawai# i 309, 312, 884 P.2d 372, 375 
(1994)). "Under the liberal construction standard, two counts 
can be read together." Id. 
For Count I, the charge tracked the language of the 
statute for Computer Fraud 3, HRS § 708-891.6. 
The charge also 
included the statutory language for the underlying predicate offense of Theft 3 from HRS § 708-832. Thus, on the basis that 
all elements of the charge as defined by the respective statutes 
are alleged in the Indictment, the charge for Computer Fraud 3 is 
not defective. See State v. Treat
, 67 Haw. 119, 120, 680 P.2d 
250, 251 (1984) (holding that a theft in the first degree charge was not defective where it tracked the statutory definition of 
the offense because the charge alleged all of the statutory 
elements of the offense). 
Shaw challenges the State's reliance on HRS § 708-
801(6) to aggregate multiple instances of theft in charging Shaw 
with Computer Fraud 3 and argues that even if the State's 
reliance on HRS § 708-801(6) was proper, the State was required 
to expressly allege that Shaw acted pursuant to a scheme or 
course of conduct. 
In State v. Yokota, 143 Hawai# i 200, 205-06, 426 P.3d 
424, 429-30 (2018), the 
Hawai# i Supreme Court held that theft can 
be charged as a continuing course of conduct and that the alleged instances of theft can be aggregated under HRS § 708-801(6). In 
that case, the circuit court dismissed the counts charging Yokota 
10    
        
      
         
     
       
      
       
        
     
           . . . . NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
with Theft in the Second Degree and Identity Theft in the Second
Degree.  Id. at 204, 426 P.3d at 428. Notably, the charges did
not include any express allegation of a scheme or course of conduct. Nonetheless, the supreme court held that the circuit 
court erred in determining that the State was barred from 
charging theft as a continuing course of conduct and ultimately 
affirmed this court's decision to vacate the circuit court's 
order dismissing the Theft in the Second Degree and Identity 
Theft in the Second Degree counts. Id. at 206-07, 426 P.3d at 
430-31. The supreme court noted: 9 
 
While Yokota does not argue on certiorari that the
[Intermediate Court of Appeals] erred in also reinstatingCount VIII (identity theft in the second degree), ourdecision on whether the State could charge Yokota with theftin the second degree directly affects the validity of theidentity theft in the second degree charge. A person canonly be charged with identity theft in the second degree ifthat person makes or causes to be made a transmission of anypersonal information of another, "with the intent to committhe offense of theft in the second degree from any person orentity." HRS § 708-839.7 (2014) (emphasis added). 
Id. at 205 n.7, 426 P.3d at 429 n.7. 
In Count I, Shaw was charged with Computer Fraud 3, 
which requires an allegation that the charged individual 
"knowingly accesse[d] a computer, computer system, or computer 
9 The relevant charges were: 
Count  VI:  Th eft  in  the  Second  Degree,  in  violation  of
HRS  §  708-831(1)(b),  where  Yokota  "did  obtain  or  exert
unauthorized  control  over  the  property  of  [Kama]  and/or  [ASB],
the  value  of  which  exceeds  Three  Hundred  Dollars  ($300.00),  by
deception,  with  intent  to  deprive  [Kama]  and/or  [ASB]  of  the
property." 
C
ount VIII: Identity Theft in the Second Degree, in
violation of HRS § 708-839.7, where Yokota 
did make or cause to be made, either directly or
indirectly, a transmission of any personalinformation of [Kama] by any oral statement, anywritten statement, or any statement conveyed byelectronic means, with the intent to commit theoffense of Theft in the Second Degree from [Kama]and/or [ASB] . . . . 
Id. at 202-03, 426 P.3d at 426-27 (footnotes omitted). 
11 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
network with the intent to commit the offense of theft in the 
third or fourth degree." HRS § 708-891.6 (emphasis added). 
Thus, because Computer Fraud 3 is predicated on theft in the 
third or fourth degree, it follows that Computer Fraud 3 may also 
be charged as a continuing course of conduct. Cf. Yokota, 143 
Hawai# i at 205 n.7, 426 P.3d at 429 n.7. We therefore conclude 
that the State was not barred from aggregating multiple alleged 
instances of theft in charging Shaw with Computer Fraud 3. 
We 
further conclude that, under the Motta
/Wells rule, it was not 
necessary to expressly allege in the Indictment that Shaw engaged 
in a scheme or course of conduct. See id. at 202-03, 426 P.3d at 
426-27. 
Regardless, it is clear from reading the Indictment as 
a whole that the State charged Shaw with Computer Fraud 3 on a continuing course of conduct theory. Count I alleged that "[o]n 
or about January 16, 2017, through and including May 18, 2017," 
Shaw "did knowingly access a computer, computer system, or 
computer network with the intent to commit the offense of theft 
in the third degree" and that "[a] person commits the offense of 
theft in the third degree if she intentionally obtains and exerts 
unauthorized control over property of another, the value of which 
exceeds Two Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($250.00), with intent to 
deprive the other of property valued in excess of Two Hundred and 
Fifty Dollars ($250.00)." Count II identified the same four-
month time period as Count I and alleged that Shaw "did use 
credit card numbers without the consent of the cardholders 
. . . ." It can be reasonably inferred, due to the references to 
the same time period, that both charges are based on the same 
underlying conduct. Although Count I did not expressly allege 
that the conduct involved multiple victims and instances of 
theft, when read in conjunction with Count II, the charge is 
sufficient. See Tominiko, 126 Hawai# i at 76, 266 P.3d at 1130 
(holding that, under the liberal construction standard, a charge for Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence (OVUII) was not 
12            
            
         
     NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
insufficient for failing to allege that the conduct occurred on a 
public roadway where a separate count contained the necessary 
allegation and both counts refer to operating a motor vehicle on 
the same day in Honolulu, Hawai# i). The Indictment, when read as 
a whole, apprised Shaw that she was being charged for multiple thefts involving multiple credit card transactions. Shaw has not 
shown that Count I cannot reasonably be construed to allege a 
crime under the 
Motta/
Wells rule.10 
Having concluded that the Indictment can reasonably be 
construed to charge the offense of Computer Fraud 3, we now turn 
to whether Shaw has shown that she was prejudiced under the 
Motta/Wells rule. 
[I]n determining whether the accused's right to be informed
of the nature and cause of the accusation against him or herhas been violated, we must look to all of the informationsupplied to him or her by the State to the point where thecourt passes upon the contention that the right has beenviolated. 
State v. Hitchcock, 123 Hawai# i 369, 379, 235 P.3d 365, 375 
(2010) (emphasis and original brackets omitted). Furthermore, "a 
defendant's right to be informed of the nature and cause of the 
accusation can be deemed satisfied if the record 'clearly 
demonstrate[s] the defendant's 
actual knowledge' of the charges 
against him or her." Id.
 (alteration in original) (quoting State 
v. Israel, 78 Hawai# i 66, 71, 890 P.2d 303, 308 (1995)). 
As Shaw only challenges the sufficiency of the 
Indictment for the first time on appeal, we look to the record 
below to determine whether Shaw's right to be informed of the 
nature and cause of the accusations can be deemed satisfied. The 
record reflects that, at the grand jury proceedings, the State 
introduced exhibits that consisted of copies of the 105 credit 
card receipts, as well as a spreadsheet that summarized the

based on the liberal construction standard and we do not address whether an 
analysis under the standard governing pre-conviction challenges to sufficiency ofcharges would reach a different result.

               NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
transactional details of the 105 credit card receipts. In a 
Motion to Dismiss filed by Shaw, she refers to these documents as 
appearing to be duplicates of what was produced in discovery, 
indicating her receipt of the documents. Shaw also specifically 
acknowledges and discusses the State's aggregation of the amounts 
involved in multiple credit card transactions upon which the 
charge was based. Thus, the record is clear that Shaw was fully 
aware that the charge was based on aggregated amounts. We 
therefore find no merit in Shaw's contention that she was not 
provided adequate notice of the nature of the charge against her. 
We also find no merit in Shaw's contention that she 
suffered prejudice because the State was relieved of its burden 
to call all 105 witnesses and Shaw was deprived of her right to 
confront all 105 witnesses. The prosecution is not required to 
call as witnesses all individuals who have knowledge of the 
events disclosed by the evidence and pertaining to the offense 
alleged to have been committed by the defendant. See State v. 
Padilla, 114 Hawai# i 507, 516, 164 P.3d 765, 774 (App. 2007). 
Indeed, the record reflects that the jury in this case was given 
an instruction stating such, to which Shaw made no objection.11 
The State therefore did not have a burden to call all 105 cardholders as witnesses and could instead rely on other 
evidence. 
Shaw has not shown that Count I cannot be construed to 
charge Computer Fraud 3, or that she has suffered prejudice from 
the State's failure to allege a scheme or course of conduct in 
Count I. Therefore, under the liberal Motta/Wells rule, Shaw has 
not shown that Count I was insufficient so as to warrant vacating 
11 The jury instruction was based on Hawai #i Pattern Jury Instructions -
Criminal (HAWJIC) Instruction 3.12 (1991) and provided as follows: 
The prosecution is not required to call as witnesses all
persons who may have been present at any of the eventsdisclosed by the evidence or who may appear to have someknowledge of these events, or to produce all objects ordocuments mentioned or suggested by the evidence.

her conviction of Computer Fraud 3. 
2. Count II (Credit Card Fraud) was legally insufficient. 
For Count II, the charge appears to substantially track 
the language of the statute for Credit Card Fraud, with one 
notable difference -- the plain language of HRS § 708-8100(1)(c) 
is written in the singular, indicating that the offense occurs 
upon a defendant's fraudulent use of a single credit card, but 
the State charged Shaw with Credit Card Fraud based on her use of 
multiple credit cards. Under HRS § 708-8100(1)(c), a person 
commits Credit Card Fraud if the person "[u]ses or attempts or 
conspires to use a credit card number without the consent of the 
cardholder for the purpose of obtaining money, goods, services, 
or anything else of value." (Emphases added.) Here, the State 
charged Shaw with "us[ing] credit card numbers without the 
consent of the cardholders" (emphases added) to obtain money in 
excess of $300 between January 16, 2017, and May 18, 2017. The 
State met the $300 threshold to charge Shaw with Credit Card 
Fraud as a class C felony12 by aggregating numerous transactions 
involving multiple credit cards because none of the individual transactions exceeded $300 in value. 
Shaw argues that the State was not allowed to aggregate 
the use of multiple credit cards in charging Shaw with Credit 
Card Fraud. Shaw further argues that if such aggregation is 
allowed, then pursuant to HRS § 708-801(6), the State was 
required to allege a scheme or course of conduct in Count II to 
provide Shaw with adequate notice and alert her of precisely what 
she needed to defend against to avoid a conviction. 
We first look to the plain language of HRS § 708-8100 
in determining whether the offense of Credit Card Fraud can be 
based on an aggregation of transactions involving multiple credit 
cards. See State v. Demello, 136 Hawai# i 193, 195, 361 P.3d 420, 
12 Credit Card Fraud is a class C felony "if the value of all money,
goods, services, and other things of value obtained or attempted to be obtained
exceeds $300 in any six-month period." HRS § 708-8100(2). 
15 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
422 (2015) ("The plain language of a statute is 'the fundamental 
starting point of statutory interpretation.'"). The plain 
language of HRS § 708-8100 is written in the singular, indicating 
that the offense is committed based on the use of "a credit card" 
or "a credit card number" "without the consent of the 
cardholder." Further, subsection (2) expressly contemplates 
aggregation of the value of the goods obtained through fraudulent 
use by referring to "goods, services, and other things of value" 
in the plural. HRS § 708-8100(2). In the following sentence, it 
seems the legislature intentionally refers to "each separate use 
of a credit card" that exceeds $300 as creating a separate 
offense. Id. (emphasis added). Thus, the legislature carefully 
distinguished between singular and plural forms in the same statutory provision, indicating an intent to proscribe the 
fraudulent use of "a credit card," and to provide for the 
aggregation of dollar values obtained through such use. In this 
context, the legislature did not provide for the aggregation of 
transactions involving multiple credit cards. 
The use of singular language, however, is not 
conclusive. AlohaCare v. Ito, 126 Hawai# i 326, 347, 271 P.3d 
621, 642 (2012). 
HRS § 1-17 (2009) provides the general rule of 
statutory construction that "[w]ords . . . in the singular or 
plural number signify both the singular and plural number[.]" 
Nonetheless, "[t]his court has interpreted statutes using the 
statutory presumption in HRS § 1-17 only after reviewing the 
legislative history and context in which a statute was passed to 
determine whether the legislature intended to signify both the 
singular and plural forms of a word." AlohaCare, 126 Hawai# i at 
347, 271 P.3d at 642. 
Thus, we must look to legislative history 
to determine whether the legislature intended prosecution for the 
offense of Credit Card Fraud under HRS § 708-8100 to be based on 
the use of multiple credit cards or credit card numbers. 
The original form of the Credit Card Fraud statute was 
first enacted in 1965, along with other credit card offenses. 
16 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
1965 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 189, § 2 at 267. The legislature 
explained: 
The purpose of this bill is to set forth criminal
offenses involving credit cards and penalties relating
thereto. 
Your Committee finds that both consumers and 
businessmen have suffered substantial losses because of thewrongful use of credit cards. 
Many frauds are incurred
where a credit card is lost or stolen and subsequentlymisappropriated.  
H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 252, in 1965 House Journal, at 596. 
There is nothing in the legislative history of the original 
Credit Card Fraud statute to indicate that the legislature 
intended to signify both singular and plural forms of the phrases 
"a credit card," "a credit card number," and "without the consent 
of the cardholder." See id.; H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 441, in 
1965 House Journal, at 650; S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 697, in 1965 Senate Journal, at 1113. Neither does the legislative history of 
subsequent amendments to the statute contain any indication that 
the legislature intended the offense to be prosecuted based on 
multiple credit cards or credit card numbers. Conf. Comm. Rep. 
No. 94-06, in 2006 House Journal, at 1813, 2006 Senate Journal, 
at 946-47; S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 3215, in 2006 Senate Journal, 
at 1557; H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 665-06, in 2006 House Journal,

70, in 1970 House Journal, at 1055-58; H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 
317-70, in 1970 House Journal, at 904-05. 
In the absence of any legislative history indicating 
that the legislature intended Credit Card Fraud to be prosecuted 
as a felony based on multiple credit cards or credit card 
numbers, we rely on the legislative intent expressed in the plain 
language of the statute, as analyzed above, without resorting to 
HRS § 1-17. 
Furthermore, in analyzing HRS § 851-4 (Supp. 1982),13 
the predecessor statute to HRS § 708-8100, this court has held 
that "[t]he utility of the six-month period is . . . to cumulate 
the number of fraudulent uses of the same credit card and 
aggregate the value of the goods during such period to permit a 
felony charge[.]" State v. Daly, 4 Haw. App. 52, 56, 659 P.2d 
83, 86 (1983) (emphasis added). Thus, under HRS § 708-8100(2), the offense of Credit Card Fraud can be charged as a class C 
felony by aggregating the dollar values of multiple transactions 
involving the same credit card, but not by aggregating the values 
of multiple transactions involving more than one credit card or 
credit card number. 
Based on the foregoing, we conclude that Count II was 
13 HRS § 851-4 (Supp. 1982) provided: 
§851-4   Fr audulent  use  of  credit  cards,  etc.,  penalties.
A  person,  who,  with  intent  to  defraud  the  issuer,  a  person  or
organization  providing  money,  goods,  services,  or  anything
else  of  value,  or  any  other  person,  .  .  .  (2)  obtains  or
attempts  or  conspires  to  obtain  money,  goods,  services,  or
anything  else  of  value  by  representing  without  the  consent  of
the  cardholder  that  he  is  the  holder  of  a  specified  card  or  by
representing  that  he  is  the  holder  of  a  card  and  such  card  has
not  in  fact  been  issued,  violates  this  section  and  is  subject
to  the  penalties  set  forth  in  subsection  851-10(a),  if  the
value  of  all  money,  goods,  services,  and  other  things  of  value
obtained  or  attempted  to  be  obtained  in  violation  of  this
section  does  not  exceed  $100  in  any  six-month  period;  and  is
subject  to  the  penalties  set  forth  in  subsection  851-10(b),  if
such  value  exceeds  $100  in  any  six-month  period. 
18 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
defective for improperly aggregating the values of transactions 
arising from multiple credit cards and thus cannot reasonably be 
construed to charge the offense of Credit Card Fraud under HRS 
§ 708-8100 as a class C felony. We therefore vacate Shaw's 
conviction for Count II. 
B. Motion to Dismiss the Indictment 
Shaw contends that the circuit court should have 
granted her Motion to Dismiss because the evidence that the State 
adduced before the grand jury was insufficient to establish 
probable cause for the charged offenses. 
Regarding Count II, we conclude that there was 
insufficient evidence to establish probable cause that Shaw 
committed Credit Card Fraud as charged. In light of our 
conclusion discussed supra that Credit Card Fraud cannot be 
charged as a class C felony by aggregating the values of 
transactions involving multiple credit cards or credit card 
numbers, we further conclude that there was insufficient evidence 
to establish probable cause that Shaw used a single credit card 
or credit card number without the consent of the cardholder to 
obtain money in excess of $300. See HRS § 708-8100(1)(c), (2). 
The circuit court therefore erred in not dismissing Count II. 
As for Count I, Computer Fraud 3, Shaw's challenge to 
the Motion to Dismiss has no merit on appeal. 
In State v. Montgomery, 103 Hawai #i 373, 381, 82 P.3d 818,
826 (App. 2004), we held that the defendant could not
challenge, on appeal, the denial of his or her motion todismiss the indictment for lack of probable cause after aconviction. In support of our holding, we cited In re Doe,102 
Hawai #i 75, 78, 73 P.3d 29, 32 (2003), in which the
Hawai #i Supreme Court stated that "absent unusual
circumstances, any defects in a pretrial determination ofprobable cause are rendered moot, or are without anyeffective remedy, which is much the same thing, by asubsequent conviction." 
State v. Torres, 122 Hawai# i 2, 14 n.7, 222 P.3d 409, 421 n.7 
(App. 2009), aff'd and corrected on other grounds by 125 Hawai# i 
382, 262 P.3d 1006 (2011). 
Shaw's challenge to the circuit 
court's denial of her motion to dismiss the Computer Fraud 3 
19 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
charge based on a lack of probable cause was rendered moot by her 
subsequent conviction of the offense after trial. There are no 
unusual circumstances in this case. 
C. Jury Instructions 
Shaw challenges the definition of "inference" given in 
the circuit court's jury instructions. At trial, defense counsel 
objected to the instruction with the definition of "inference" on 
the basis that there was already a separate general instruction, 
based on HAWJIC, that discussed circumstantial evidence, which 
permits reasonable inferences to be drawn. 
The circuit court instructed the jury on the definition 
of "inference" as follows: 
An "inference" is a logical and reasonable conclusion of the
existence of a fact from the establishment of other facts,from which, by the process of logic and reason, and based onhuman experience, the existence of an assumed fact may beconcluded by the jury. Lack of consent may be provedcircumstantially on the basis of logical and reasonableinferences drawn from the evidence adduced and common human experience. 
On appeal, Shaw argues that the given definition was 
confusing, unclear, unhelpful, and failed to instruct the jury in 
a manner that they could understand. Shaw cites no authority to 
support her conclusory assertions. Shaw also argues that the 
given definition for "inference" was misleading and prejudicial 
as it contradicted the concept of reasonable doubt, which 
prohibits finding the defendant guilty based on mere suspicion or 
probability. 
The definition of "inference" given in this instruction 
is identical to the definition adopted by the Hawai# i Supreme 
Court in State v. Pone, 78 Hawai# i 262, 273, 892 P.2d 455, 466 
(1995), and is thus a correct statement of the law. 
Furthermore, 
we find nothing in the given instruction that is inconsistent with the law pertaining to reasonable doubt. As such, we 
conclude that the jury instruction was not erroneous. 
Shaw next challenges the circuit court's instructions 
20           
            
              
            NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
on the elements of Computer Fraud 3.  Shaw did not raise any
objection to this jury instruction at trial. 14 
The circuit court instructed the jury on the elements 
of Computer Fraud 3 as follows: 
In Count I, the Defendant, Susan E. Shaw, is charged
with committing the offense of Computer Fraud in the Third
Degree. 
A person commits the offense of Computer Fraud in the
Third Degree if she accesses a computer, computer system, orcomputer network with the intent to commit the offense oftheft in the third degree. 
There are two elements to the offense of Computer
Fraud in the Third Degree, each of which the prosecutionmust prove beyond a reasonable doubt. 
These two elements are: 
1. That on or about the January 16, 2017, through
and including the May 18, 2017, in the City andCounty of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, theDefendant, Susan E. Shaw, accessed a computer,computer system, or computer network; and 
2. That the Defendant, Susan E. Shaw, did so withthe intent to commit the offense of theft in the third degree. 
A person commits the offense of theft in the third
degree if she obtains or exerts unauthorized control overthe property of another, the value of which exceeds $250.00,with intent to deprive the person of that property. 
Shaw reiterates her contention that the State could not 
aggregate theft amounts for the purpose of charging Shaw with 
Computer Fraud 3. Shaw further argues that, with the aggregated 
nature of the charge, the circuit court erred in failing to 
instruct the jury on the definition of scheme and the mens rea 
related to Shaw's intent to engage in a scheme. 
As we have discussed supra, the State was allowed to 
aggregate the amounts upon which the Computer Fraud 3 charge wasbased, pursuant to HRS § 708-801(6). However, in Yokota, the  
14 Shaw also challenges the jury instruction on the elements of Credit 
Card Fraud. However, because we vacate Shaw's conviction for Credit Card Fraud
on the basis of a legally insufficient charge, we need not address the portion ofShaw's challenge to the jury instructions that relates to the Credit Card Fraudcharge.

        NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
supreme court emphasized that the question of "whether a 
continuing course of conduct offense occurred is a question that 
should be submitted to the jury." 143 Hawai# i at 206, 426 P.3d 
at 430 (citing State v. Matias, 102 Hawai# i 300, 305, 75 P.3d 
1191, 1196 (2003) ("The test to determine whether the defendant 
intended to commit more than one offense is whether the evidence 
discloses one general intent or discloses separate and distinct 
intents. . . . All factual issues involved in this determination 
must be decided by the trier of fact." (emphasis in original)), 
and People v. Daghita, 92 N.Y.S.2d 799, 802 (N.Y. App. Div. 1949) 
("What is 'separate', what is 'single', . . . are all jury 
questions both by legal tradition and by necessity. . . . The 
question of whether the takings were separate or united in 
purpose was carefully and fairly submitted to the jury as a 
question of fact[.]")). 
Here, the instruction regarding Computer Fraud 3 did 
not submit to the jury the factual question of whether Shaw 
engaged in one scheme or course of conduct, in other words, 
whether the evidence disclosed one general intent or separate and 
distinct intents. The question was determinative of whether Shaw 
met the $250 threshold to be convicted of Computer Fraud 3 based 
on an aggregation of numerous transactions, where none of the 
individual transactions exceeded $250 in value. Thus, we cannot 
say that there was no reasonable possibility that the circuit 
court's failure to submit the issue to the jury contributed to 
Shaw's conviction; the error was therefore not harmless beyond a 
reasonable doubt. See Nichols, 111 Hawai# i at 337, 141 P.3d at 
984. Shaw's conviction for Computer Fraud 3 must be vacated on 
this ground and remanded for a new trial.15 
V. CONCLUSION 
Based on the foregoing, we vacate the Judgment of 
15 In light of our decision to vacate Shaw's conviction of both counts,
we need not address Shaw's remaining points of error.
