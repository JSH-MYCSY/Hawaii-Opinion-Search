ORDER GRANTING AUGUST 2, 2018 MOTION TO

(AOAO Mott-Smith Laniloa), Certified Management, Inc. dba Associa

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to dismiss appellate court case number CAAP-18-0000601 for lack
 
of appellate jurisdiction, (2) Defendants/Cross-Claim Defendants/
 Cross-Claim Plaintiffs/Appellees Patricia Choi and Patricia Choi
 Realty, Inc. dba Choi International's (the Choi Defendants)
 August 3, 2018 joinder in AOAO Mott-Smith Laniloa, Certified
 Management, and the Board of Directors of Mott-Smith Laniloa's
 August 2, 2018 motion, (3) Plaintiff-Appellant Williamson Bun
 Chin Chang's (Chang) August 8, 2018 memorandum in opposition to
 AOAO Mott-Smith Laniloa, Certified Management, and the Board of
 Directors of Mott-Smith Laniloa's August 2, 2018 motion, and
 (4) the record, it appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction
 over the Honorable Bert I. Ayabe's two June 29, 2018
 interlocutory orders summarily adjudicating Count 1, Count 3,
 Count 4, Count 6, Count 8 and Count 9 of Chang's nine-count first
 amended complaint against Chang and in favor of the defendants,
 because the circuit court has neither adjudicated the remaining
 multiple claims nor reduced any of the substantive rulings to an
 appealable final judgment.
 
An aggrieved party cannot obtain appellate review of a 
circuit court's dispositive orders in a civil case pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-1(a)(2016) until the circuit court reduces the dispositive rulings to an appealable final judgment pursuant to Rule 58 of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP). See Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 
76 Hawai' i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994) ("An appeal may 
be taken from circuit court orders resolving claims against parties only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]"). "Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 
119 Hawai' i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008). Consequently, 
"[a]n appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 120, 
869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote omitted). On September 14, 2018, the 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
circuit court clerk filed the record on appeal for appellate 
court case number CAAP-18-0000601, which does not include an appealable final judgment. The two June 29, 2018 interlocutory orders do not adjudicate all of the remaining multiple claims in this case, and are therefore not independently appealable or subject to remand under Waikiki v. Ho' omaka Village Assoc. of 
Apt. Owners, 140 Hawai' i 197, 204, 398 P.3d 786, 793 (2017). In 
the absence of an appealable final judgment, Chang's appeal is premature, and we lack appellate jurisdiction.
 Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that AOAO Mott-Smith
 
Laniloa, Certified Management, and the Board of Directors of
 Mott-Smith Laniloa's August 2, 2018 motion to dismiss appellate
 court case number CAAP-18-0000601 is granted, and appellate court
 case number CAAP-18-0000601 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
