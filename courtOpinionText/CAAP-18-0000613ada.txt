APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

JANUARY 23, 2023 
GINOZA, C.J., AND LEONARD AND WADSWORTH, JJ.
OPINION OF THE COURT BY WADSWORTH, J.  
In 2013, Plaintiffs-Appellees Stephen Keawe Roy (Roy) 
and Rebecca Roy (collectively, the Roys) sued Defendants-
Appellants Government Employees Insurance Co. and GEICO Insurance 
Agency, Inc. (collectively, GEICO), as well as certain 
individuals, for alleged violations of the Hawai# i Whistle 
Blowers' Protection Act and other purported wrongdoing. The  
  
    FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
parties settled the case, and in January 2014, the Circuit Court 
of the First Circuit (Circuit Court) entered an order approving 
the parties' stipulation to seal the court's case file (Sealing
Order).1/ The case was dismissed with prejudice. In May 2018, Ed 
Wagner (Wagner), a GEICO policyholder who was not a party to the underlying case, filed a motion to unseal the case records. The 
Circuit Court granted the motion and subsequently denied GEICO's motion to reseal portions of the records.
2/ 
GEICO appeals from the July 6, 2018 "Order on Motion to 
Unseal (Filed May 22, 2016 [sic])" (Unsealing Order) and the 
July 31, 2018 "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order 
Denying GEICO's Motion to Reseal Filed Documents" (FOFs/COLs/Order) (collectively, Unsealing Orders), both entered 
by the Circuit Court. 
On appeal, GEICO contends that the Circuit Court erred: 
(1) in granting Wagner's motion to unseal the case file on the 
basis of the public right of access, because the court failed to give adequate weight to countervailing compelling interests; and (2) in denying GEICO's motion to reseal selected portions of the case file, because the court failed to recognize the compelling interests in sealing those portions, the substantial harm to those interests from not sealing, and the lack of alternatives to sealing.
3/ 
We hold that the Circuit Court properly evaluated the 
Sealing Order in light of the procedural and substantive requirements for sealing court records, as set forth in Grube v. Trader, 142 Hawai# i 412, 420 P.3d 343 (2018). As to the 
substantive requirements, GEICO failed to demonstrate that there were no less restrictive alternatives to sealing the entire case file that would adequately protect any compelling interest

asserted by GEICO. 
The Circuit Court thus did not err in 
ordering the case file unsealed and delaying implementation of 
the unsealing to allow GEICO to file a motion to reseal specific portions of the record. 
We further hold that GEICO failed to meet its burden to 
prove that its request to reseal and redact portions of the record would serve a compelling interest. GEICO asserts three purportedly compelling interests that would be served by such resealing: protecting the attorney-client privilege, work product, and trade secrets. Based on our review of the record, including the documents at issue, we conclude that the Circuit Court did not err in determining that GEICO failed to meet its burden to prove that: (1) the purported attorney-client communications it sought to reseal were made for the purpose of facilitating the rendition of professional legal services by Roy to GEICO; (2) the materials it sought to reseal were protected by the work-product doctrine; and (3) the information it sought to redact constituted trade secrets. 
Accordingly, we affirm the Unsealing Orders. 
I. Background 
The following findings of fact by the Circuit Court are 
unchallenged on appeal and thus binding on the parties and this court, see State v. Rodrigues, 145 Hawai# i 487, 494, 454 P.3d 
428, 435 (2019): 
FINDINGS OF FACT 
1. GEICO does business in the State of Hawai #i as a 
motor vehicle insurer. 
2. . . . Roy is licensed to practice law in the State
of Hawai #i. 
3. GEICO employed Roy as Managing Attorney for its
Honolulu-based litigation department. 
4. One of Roy's job duties was to defend persons
insured by GEICO against lawsuits arising from motor vehicle
accidents. 
5. Roy's supervisor was Richard Dwyer, GEICO's Staff
Counsel Director. Dwyer is a lawyer but was never licensedto practice in the State of Hawai #i. 
3 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
6. Roy worked with John Dornan, GEICO's Hawai #i 
Branch Claims Manager. Dornan is not a lawyer. 
7. Roy also worked with Timothy Dayton, GEICO's
Hawai #i Branch Office Manager. Dayton is not a lawyer. 
8. Kekuailohia M. Beamer is licensed to practice law
in the State of Hawai #i and worked as an attorney in GEICO's
Honolulu-based litigation department. 
9. Clarence S.K. Kekina is licensed to practice law
in the State of Hawai #i and worked as an attorney in GEICO's
Honolulu based litigation department. 
10. Dee White, Christine Kaakua and Kathy A.T.
Harimoto were claims examiners employed by GEICO and worked
in GEICO's Honolulu claims office in non-managerialcapacities on behalf of GEICO's insureds. 
11. Roy's complaint was filed on July 24, 2013. 
12. Roy's amended complaint was filed on
September 18, 2013. 
13. The complaint and first amended complaint allege,
among other things, that GEICO violated HRS § 378-62 (partof the Hawai #i Whistleblowers' Protection Act) and that
GEICO defamed Roy in his profession. 
14. The complaint and first amended complaint also
allege that GEICO interfered with Roy's ethical obligationsto, exercise of independent judgment for, and attorney-client relationships with, GEICO's insureds. 
15. GEICO, through its Corporate Counsel Susan H.
Hamburg [( Hamburg )], take the position that Roy "had as his
client, on the one hand, [GEICO], and, simultaneously on theother hand, [GEICO's] insureds." 
16. GEICO never filed a motion to seal or redact 
Roy's complaint or amended complaint, or any of the exhibitsto those documents, before settling this lawsuit. 
17. On January 30, 2014, the court entered an order
approving the parties' stipulation — entered into as part of
a settlement — to seal the court's entire case file [ i.e. ,
the Sealing Order]. 
18. A stipulation for dismissal of this lawsuit was
filed on January 31, 2014. 
19. Ed Wagner was a GEICO policyholder. His insured 
vehicle was damaged, and he made a claim with GEICO. He 
disagreed with GEICO's repair estimate, which called for theuse of so-called "aftermarket" parts rather than originalequipment manufacturer parts. He is a vocal critic of GEICO who has, among other things, emailed GEICO executives,submitted testimony to the Hawai #i state House of 
Representatives, created his own YouTube channel and posteda story about GEICO on an internet website.

FOFs/COLs/Order at 2-4 (some brackets added; footnote omitted).4/ 
Following the 2014 dismissal of the case, nothing 
further happened until April 20, 2018, when the Circuit Court's 
Chief Judge received a letter from Wagner dated April 18, 2018, along with an unfiled motion to unseal the court's case file. On May 22, 2018, the Circuit Court issued a notice of ex parte communication with attachments that included a filed copy of Wagner's motion. The motion sought to unseal the court's case file "[p]ursuant to the constitutional right of access provided by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and article I, section 4 of the Hawai# i Constitution[.]" On June 28, 2018, 
GEICO filed a memorandum in opposition to the motion to unseal. On July 2, 2018, Wagner filed a reply memorandum and the Roys filed a statement of no position. The motion was heard on July 6, 2018. 
Following the hearing, the Circuit Court entered the 
Unsealing Order, which granted Wagner's motion to unseal. 
The 
court concluded that the January 30, 2014 Sealing Order failed to satisfy the procedural requirements for public notice and findings to support sealing. The court also addressed the substantive arguments for sealing, concluding in part that the interests recited in the parties' stipulation - "speculation, rumors and damage to [the parties'] reputations" - were not compelling. 
As to GEICO's arguments about trade secrets and 
attorney-client communications, the court noted that GEICO had failed to present an adequate record for the court to find a substantial probability that, absent closure, these compelling interests would be harmed. The Circuit Court directed the clerk of the court to unseal the file, but delayed implementation of the order until August 16, 2018, "to allow GEICO to file a motion to re-seal and file redacted versions of specific documents contained in the court's case file." 
4/ We note that the FOFs/COLs/Order, which describes the documents at
issue in some detail, is part of the public record on appeal, as further
explained infra. Our descriptions of the documents at issue (see infra) thusrely on, and provide no further detail than, the corresponding descriptions inthe FOFs/COLs/Order. 
5  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On July 16, 2018, GEICO filed a motion to reseal filed 
documents and to file redacted documents (motion to reseal). 
Specifically, GEICO sought to seal Exhibits 1, 2, 4, and 6 of the 
July 24, 2013 verified complaint (Complaint) and the 
September 18, 2013 verified first amended complaint (Amended 
Complaint) (collectively, the complaints).5/ Additionally, GEICO 
sought to redact "Complaint Paragraphs 13, 22-31, 33-35, 37-41, 
44, 48-49, 52, 68-69, 86, 88, 90, 92, 94-96, 98, and 100" and "Amended Complaint Paragraphs 11, 20-29, 31-33, 35-41, 44, 48-53, 57, 74-75, 92, 94, 96, 98, 100-102, 104, and Plaintiff's prayer for relief in the Amended Complaint Paragraph 1." GEICO argued: "There are four compelling interests supporting [GEICO's] proposed redactions: (1) attorney-client privilege,
6/ (2) work-
product doctrine; (3) the integrity of [GEICO's] sensitive trade secrets; and (4) the propriety of the judicial process." (Footnote added.) On July 23, 2018, Wagner filed a memorandum in opposition to the motion to reseal. 
Following a hearing on July 31, 2018, the Circuit Court 
entered the FOFs/COLs/Order, denying GEICO's motion to reseal. The Circuit Court ruled in part: 
MIXED FINDINGS OF FACT 
AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 
1. None of the exhibits GEICO seeks to redact are 
"confidential communications made for the purpose offacilitating the rendition of professional legal services[by Roy] to [GEICO]". [Hawai #i Rules of Evidence ( HRE)]
Rule 503(b). They are not subject to or protected byGEICO's attorney-client privilege. 
[Discussion of individual exhibits] 
2. In the case of Exhibit 2, even if the emails were
subject to GEICO's attorney-client privilege, GEICO waived
its privilege by copying the emails to White, Kaakua andHarimoto. 
. . . . 
3. None of the allegations contained in the complaint
or amended complaint describe "confidential communications 
5/ The exhibits to the Complaint and the Amended Complaint are
substantially the same. 
6/ "Attorney-client privilege" and "lawyer-client privilege" are used
interchangeably throughout this opinion. 
6 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
made for the purpose of facilitating the rendition of
professional legal services [by Roy] to [GEICO]". HRE Rule 503(b). . . . They are not protected by the attorney-clientprivilege. 
4. None of the contents GEICO seeks to redact are 
protected by the "work product" rule because they were not"prepared [by GEICO] in anticipation of [this] litigation orfor trial" of this lawsuit. [Hawai #i Rules of Civil 
Procedure ( HRCP )] Rule 26(b)(4). 
Rather, they are the
subjects of this lawsuit. 
5. None of the contents GEICO seek to redact 
constitute "trade secrets." 
. . . . 
6. Even if any of the content GEICO seek to redact
constituted "trade secrets," GEICO did not make efforts thatwere reasonable under the circumstances to maintain their secrecy. 
. . . . 
7. The possibilities that Wagner's motion to unseal
was motivated by "his animus toward GEICO" (Dornandeclaration ¶3), that Wagner could use the pleadings filedin this case to further an alleged "vendetta against GEICO"(Dornan declaration ¶7) or that Wagner "is endeavoring touse this Court as a vehicle to gratify his spite againstGEICO and Mr. Dayton and promote public scandal" (Dornandeclaration ¶12) are not compelling interests that overridethe constitutional presumption that court records shall beopen to the public. 
a. As a member of the public, Wagner has aconstitutional right of access to courtproceedings and records, including the recordsin this case. 
FOFs/COLs/Order at 19-25 (some brackets added). 
Thus, the Circuit Court denied GEICO's motion to reseal 
based on Wagner's constitutional right of access to court 
proceedings and records. The Circuit Court ordered: "The court's file for this case . . . shall be unsealed in its entirety and without redaction on August 16, 2018, pursuant to 
the [Unsealing Order]." Id. at 26. 
On August 6, 2018, GEICO filed its notice of appeal, 
with attached copies of the Unsealing Orders, in this court. On 
August 7, 2018, GEICO filed a motion to stay execution of the Unsealing Orders in the Circuit Court. 
On August 14, 2018, the Circuit Court entered an "Order 
on GEICO's Motion to Stay," which denied the motion as moot, "because the court lost jurisdiction to unseal the case file on 
7 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
August 6, 2018, when GEICO filed their notice of appeal." 
The 
Circuit Court further ordered: 
The clerk of the court is directed to not unseal the court's 
file, and to take no action other than to transmit thesealed portion of the record, the court's order publiclyfiled on July 6, 2018, and the documents and orders publiclyfiled thereafter, to the Intermediate Court of Appealspursuant to HRAP Rule 11(b). 
For purposes of the record on appeal, the Circuit Court thus 
distinguished "the sealed portion of the record" from the publicly filed July 6, 2018 Unsealing Order and the documents and orders publicly filed after that date. 
On October 1, 2018, in compliance with the Circuit 
Court's Order on GEICO's Motion to Stay, the Circuit Court clerk transmitted to this court the "RECORD ON APPEAL (PART 1 OF 2 -SEALED)," which was filed under seal at appellate docket 28, and the "RECORD ON APPEAL (PART 2 OF 2)," which was publicly filed at appellate docket 30. Part 2 of the record on appeal includes the Unsealing Order and all documents publicly filed in the Circuit Court after July 6, 2018, including GEICO's July 16, 2018 motion to reseal, along with supporting declarations and redacted exhibits, as well as the July 31, 2018 FOFs/COLs/Order. 
The Circuit Court's Order on GEICO's Motion to Stay is 
not at issue in this appeal. 
II. Standard of Review 
The question whether the public has a qualified 
constitutional right of access to court records is a question of law, which we review de novo. See Hussey v. Say, 139 Hawai# i 
181, 185, 384 P.3d 1282, 1286 (2016) ("The appellate court reviews 'questions of constitutional law 
de novo, under the 
right/wrong standard.'"); see also Grube, 142 Hawai# i at 426 
n.17, 420 P.3d at 357 n.17 ("There is nothing in the sealed documents to demonstrate on their face that disclosure would pose a threat to an interest of adequate gravity to overcome the public's constitutional right of access."); Times Mirror Co. v. United States
, 873 F.2d 1210, 1212 (9th Cir. 1989) ("The question 
whether the public has a qualified First Amendment right of 
8 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
access to search warrants and supporting affidavits during the 
pre-indictment stage of a criminal investigation is a question of law, which we review 
de novo."). 
III. Discussion 
A. The Unsealing Order 
GEICO contends that the Circuit Court erred in 
unsealing the case file and ignoring "the compelling interest in favor of promoting judicial settlements[.]" GEICO argues that the court-approved stipulation to seal the case file, given Roy's "spurious allegations" and the confidential information he included in and attached to the complaints, "was a vital benefit of the bargain for GEICO." GEICO maintains that its reliance interest "outweighs any right of public access to the long-sealed and long-settled judicial records." GEICO further argues that the interest in promoting settlements is particularly compelling here, because the sealed materials never should have been "docketed," i.e., publicly filed, in the first instance, and are no longer current. GEICO also contends that the Circuit Court "erred in sanctioning the use of the judicial process for improper purposes[,]" because "[i]t is clear from [Wagner's] vitriolic and widespread attacks against GEICO that Wagner is attempting to use the unsealing of the records in this case to further his campaign of disparaging and harassing GEICO." 
Courts in Hawai# i "have a long tradition of 
accessibility by the public[.]" Oahu Publications Inc. v. Ahn, 
133 Hawai# i 482, 494, 331 P.3d 460, 472 (2014) (tracing the 
history of public access to judicial records). 
Accordingly, the 
Hawai# i Supreme Court "has recognized a tradition of public 
access, declaring it 'firmly embedded in our system of jurisprudence' as a 'general policy of open trials.'" Id. at 
495, 331 P.3d at 473 (quoting 
Gannett Pac. Corp. v. Richardson, 
59 Haw. 224, 228, 580 P.2d 49, 54 (1978)). The supreme court has further explained: 
The right of public access corresponds with our
system's "deeply ingrained" traditional mistrust for secret
trials . . . . Gannett Pac. Corp.[, 59 Haw. at 228, 580 
9 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 P.2d at 54]. The right of access thus functions not only to
protect the public's ability to obtain information—arequisite "to the enjoyment of other First Amendmentrights"—but also "as a safeguard of the integrity of ourcourts." Ahn, 133 Hawai #i at 494-95, 331 P.3d at 472-73
(quoting Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court for the Cty.of Norfolk, 457 U.S. 596, 604, 102 S. Ct. 2613, 73 L. Ed. 2d248 (1982); State v. Hashimoto, 47 Haw. 185, 200, 389 P.2d146, 155 (1963)). 
Grube, 142 Hawai# i at 422, 420 P.3d at 353. 
In Ahn and Grube, the supreme court examined the right 
of public access in the context of criminal proceedings. In Ahn, 
the court ruled that the U.S. Constitution and article I, section 4 of the Hawai# i Constitution grant the public a qualified right 
of access to observe court proceedings in criminal trials. 
133 
Hawai# i at 494, 496, 331 P.3d 460, 472, 474. In Grube, the court 
further ruled that the public's "right of access to court proceedings in criminal cases . . . is not limited to merely observing criminal trials." 
142 Hawai# i at 422, 420 P.3d at 353 
(footnote and citations omitted). 
Rather, "the public has a 
constitutional right of access to criminal proceedings generally, as well as the records thereof." Id. (citing 
Ahn, 133 Hawai# i at 
498-99, 331 P.3d at 476-77). 
Although Ahn and Grube involved criminal proceedings, 
the court in Ahn recognized that "[t]he reasons underlying openness in the criminal context, as enunciated in Gannett Pac. Corp., are equally compelling in the civil context." Ahn, 133 
Hawai# i at 496 n.18, 331 P.3d at 474 n.18 (original brackets 
omitted) (quoting In re Estate of Campbell, 106 Hawai# i 453, 462, 
106 P.3d 1096, 1105 (2005)); see also Nixon v. Warner Commc'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 597 (1978) ("It is clear that the courts of this country recognize a general right to inspect and copy public records and documents, including judicial records and documents." (footnote omitted)); Courthouse News Serv. v. Planet, 947 F.3d 581, 590 (9th Cir. 2020) ("The Supreme Court has yet to explicitly rule on whether the First Amendment right of access to information reaches civil judicial proceedings and records, but the federal courts of appeals widely agree that it does. Indeed, every circuit to consider the issue has uniformly concluded that the right applies to both civil and criminal proceedings." 
10 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(citations omitted)). 
Grube
 reiterated the reasons for open proceedings, but 
also recognized that "[n]otwithstanding these serious 
considerations, the public's constitutional right of access is not absolute." 142 Hawai# i at 423, 420 P.3d at 354 (citing Ahn, 
133 Hawai# i at 496, 331 P.3d at 474). "In 'rare and compelling 
circumstances,' court proceedings may be closed to protect an interest 'that outweighs the value of openness.'" Id. (citing 
Ahn, 133 Hawai# i at 495-96, 331 P.3d at 473-74); see also In re 
Estate of Campbell, 106 Hawai# i at 465, 106 P.3d at 1108 
(adopting a balancing approach in which the party seeking closure must show that "strong countervailing reasons" outweigh the public's right of access to judicial proceedings and records). 
Grube discussed the procedural and substantive 
requirements for closing court proceedings or sealing records in a criminal case. 142 Hawai# i at 423-428, 420 P.3d at 354-59. 
The procedural requirements are: 
"(1) those excluded from the 
proceeding must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to state their objections; and (2) the reasons supporting closure must be articulated in findings." Id. at 423, 420 P.3d at 354 (quoting 
Ahn, 133 Hawai# i at 497-98, 331 P.3d at 475-76). The substantive 
factors that the court must consider in its findings are: 
"(1) 
the closure serves a compelling interest; (2) there is a substantial probability that, in the absence of closure, this compelling interest would be harmed; and (3) there are no alternatives to closure that would adequately protect the compelling interest." Grube, 142 Hawai# i at 424, 420 P.3d at 355 
(brackets omitted) (quoting Ahn, 133 Hawai# i at 497–98, 331 P.3d 
at 475–76). 
The supreme court and this court have indicated that 
these procedural and substantive prerequisites for sealing court documents should be applied in at least some, if not all, civil proceedings. See, e.g., 
Civil Beat Law Ctr. for Pub. Interest v. 
Chang, No. SCPW-21-0000511, 2022 WL 1490412, at *2 (Haw. May 11, 2022) (denying modified writ petition seeking to prohibit the trial judge from enforcing a sealing order: "At this time, . . . the more appropriate course of action is for petitioner to seek 
11   
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
relief, as modified, in the underlying case, and for the 
respondent judge, after all parties are heard on the matter, to thereafter enter formal written findings consistent with constitutional standards and case law, specifically Ahn and Grube."); Rohrer v. Hoyte, No. CAAP-16-0000580, 2019 WL 5457852, at *1 n.2 (Haw. App. Oct. 24, 2019) (SDO) ("The Circuit Court's order granting Defendants' ex parte motion to submit their motion to dismiss under seal does not contain specific findings as required by Grube v. Trader, 142 Hawai# i 412, 424, 420 P.3d 343, 
355 (2018)." (citing Estate of Campbell, 106 Hawai# i at 462, 106 
P.3d at 1105)).
7/ Moreover, prior to Ahn and Grube, the supreme 
court applied similar procedural and substantive standards for sealing court records in a probate (i.e., civil) proceeding, based on the right of public access to judicial proceedings and records. See Estate of Campbell, 106 Hawai# i at 465, 106 P.3d at 
1108 (holding that third parties have a right to challenge the sealing of probate court records, and "the presumption of openness requires the [party seeking closure] to demonstrate that strong countervailing reasons weigh against the public's presumptive right of general access to judicial proceedings and records.") Accordingly, here, the Circuit Court properly evaluated the Sealing Order in light of Grube
's procedural and 
substantive prerequisites for sealing court records.8/ 
7/ We also take judicial notice that on August 27, 2018, Wagner filed
a Petition for Writ of Prohibition and Writ of Mandamus ( Petition ) in the
supreme court, seeking, among other things, a writ of mandamus ordering the
Circuit Court to unseal the underlying case. See Pet. for Writ of 
Prohibition, Wagner v. Hiraoka, No. SCPW-18-0000670, Judiciary InformationManagement System dkt. 1 at 1, 26. The supreme court subsequently denied thePetition. Id., 2018 WL 5044355, at *1 (Haw. Oct. 17, 2018). In denying the
Petition, the supreme court stated, in part: "Upon consideration of . . .Wagner's [P]etition . . ., it appears that the respondent judge complied withthe procedure set forth in Grube v. Trader, 142 Hawai #i 412, 420 P.3d 343
(2018) in addressing the sealing issue . . . ." Id., 2018 WL 5044355, at *1
(emphasis added). 
8/ In Estate of Campbell, the supreme court noted: 
We express no opinion as to the applicability of the
balancing test in situations where a specific statute orrule mandates confidentiality or where such an approach maybe inappropriate, as might be the case, for example, incertain family court matters. The balancing approach shouldbe applied on a case-by-case basis. 
12 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Circuit Court concluded that neither of the two 
procedural requirements for sealing documents was satisfied when 
the court entered the Sealing Order. On appeal, GEICO does not challenge this ruling, focusing instead on the substantive requirements to overcome the right of public access. As discussed above, GEICO has asserted a number of interests that are purportedly served by keeping the entire case file sealed. However, we need not consider whether any of these interests is "compelling" or would be harmed in the absence of closure, given that GEICO has not demonstrated that "there are no [less restrictive] alternatives to closure that would adequately protect [any] compelling interest." See Grube, 142 Hawai# i at 
427, 420 P.3d at 358 (original brackets omitted) (quoting Oregonian Pub. Co. v. U.S. Dist. Court for Dist. of Or., 920 F.2d 1462, 1466 (9th Cir. 1990)); see also Estate of Campbell, 106 Hawai# i at 465, 106 P.3d at 1108 ("the presumption of openness 
requires the estate to demonstrate that strong countervailing reasons" outweigh the public's right of access (emphasis added)). As the supreme court stated in Grube: 
"
Even where denial of access is appropriate, it must be no
greater than necessary to protect the interest justifying
it." United States v. Brooklier, 685 F.2d 1162, 1172 (9th
Cir. 1982). Thus, where a feasible alternative exists thatwould protect the compelling interest while avoiding orminimizing impairment of the public's constitutional rightof access, total sealing is inappropriate. Id. at 1169; see
also Oregonian Pub. Co., 920 F.2d at 1467 n.1 . . . . 
142 Hawai# i at 427, 420 P.3d at 358. 
Thus, even if GEICO could demonstrate the first two 
substantive requirements for sealing court records, it offered no 
cogent explanation below, and offers none on appeal, as to why sealing the entire case file was necessary to protect its asserted interests. Indeed, GEICO acknowledged, in moving to reseal only selected portions of the complaints, "that the only redacted paragraphs in these documents are those [whose

disclosure] would violate a compelling interest." Accordingly, 
the Circuit Court did not err in ordering the case file unsealed and delaying implementation of the unsealing for a period of time, thereby allowing GEICO to file a motion to reseal specific portions of the record. 
B. The FOFs/COLs/Order 
GEICO argues that the Circuit Court "compounded its 
error by denying GEICO's motion to reseal selected portions of 
the record." Specifically, GEICO sought to reseal Exhibits 1, 2, 4, and 6 and to redact numerous paragraphs of the complaints, identified in section I above. GEICO identified four purportedly compelling interests that would be served by the requested resealing, three of which it asserts on appeal: protecting the attorney-client privilege, work product, and trade secrets. 
For the reasons discussed below, we hold that GEICO 
failed to meet its burden to prove that its request to reseal and redact portions of the record would serve a compelling interest. We thus do not address the remaining requirements for sealing court records. 
1. Attorney-Client Privilege 
GEICO contends that Exhibit 1 (which comprises two 
emails), as well as several paragraphs of the complaints, are subject to the attorney-client privilege.
9/ 
The supreme court has recently explained: 
In order for a document to be protected from disclosure
pursuant to the lawyer-client privilege, as defined in[Hawai #i Rules of Evidence ( HRE)] Rule 503, the document
must contain information communicated within the context of a lawyer-client relationship. HRE Rule 503(b) provides foran evidentiary privilege for confidential lawyer-clientcommunications: 
"a client has a privilege to refuse to
disclose and to prevent any other person from disclosingconfidential communications made for the purpose offacilitating the rendition of professional legal services to 
9/ GEICO asserts that the attorney-client privilege applies to: (1)
Exhibit 1 and the paragraphs that discuss that exhibit, i.e. , paragraphs 24-26
of the Complaint, and paragraphs 22-24 of the Amended Complaint; and (2)paragraphs 13, 22, 23, 27-31, 33, and 48 of the Complaint, and paragraphs 11,20, 21, 25-28, 31, and 48 of the Amended Complaint.

the client (1) between the client or the client's
representative and the lawyer or the lawyer's representative. . . ." 
Honolulu Civil Beat Inc. v. Dep't of Attorney Gen., 146 Hawai# i 
285, 293, 463 P.3d 942, 950 (2020) (original brackets omitted). 
"[P]roper practice requires preliminary judicial 
inquiry into the existence and validity of the [lawyer-client] 
privilege and the burden of establishing the privilege rests on the claimant." Id. (quoting Sapp v. Wong, 62 Haw. 34, 38, 609 
P.2d 137, 140 (1980)); see also Anastasi v. Fid. Nat. Title Ins. Co. (Anastasi I), 134 Hawai# i 400, 418, 341 P.3d 1200, 1218 (App. 
2014), aff'd in part, vacated in part, 137 Hawai# i 104, 366 P.3d 
160 (2016) (Anastasi II) ("[T]he party claiming the privilege has the burden of establishing that the privilege exists and that it applies as asserted." (citing DiCenzo v. Izawa, 68 Haw. 528, 536, 723 P.2d 171, 176 (1986); Sapp, 62 Haw. at 38, 609 P.2d at 140)). "'An ipse dixit claim of privilege' clearly does not suffice." DiCenzo, 68 Haw. at 536, 723 P.2d at 176 (quoting Sapp, 62 Haw. at 38, 609 P.2d at 140); see also United States v. Martin, 278 F.3d 988, 1000 (9th Cir. 2002) (construing analogous federal law: "A party claiming the privilege must identify specific communications and the grounds supporting the privilege as to each piece of evidence over which privilege is asserted. Blanket assertions are 'extremely disfavored.'" (citations omitted)). Thus, GEICO had the burden of establishing the asserted privilege with respect to the purportedly protected portions of the record. 
Under HRE Rule 503(a)(1), "[a] 'client' is a person, 
public officer, or corporation, association, or other organization or entity, either public or private, who is rendered professional legal services by a lawyer, or who consults with a lawyer with a view to obtaining professional legal services." An insurer such as GEICO can come within the definition of a "client," and "the purpose underlying the attorney-client privilege applies when a confidential communication is made between persons covered by HRE Rule 503 for the purpose of facilitating the rendition of legal services to an insurer." Anastasi I, 134 Hawai# i at 418, 341 P.3d at 1218. 
15 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 We have noted the challenges in determining whether the 
privilege applies when a company's in-house attorney is involved: 
[U]nlike the situation where a client individually engages a
lawyer in a particular matter, staff attorneys may serve ascompany officers, with mixed business-legal responsibility;whether or not officers, their day-to-day involvement intheir employers' affairs may blur the line between legal andnonlegal communications; and their advice may originate notin response to the client's consultation about a particularproblem but with them, as part of an ongoing, permanentrelationship with the organization. In that the privilegeobstructs the truth-finding process and its scope is limitedto that which is necessary to achieve its purpose, the needto apply it cautiously and narrowly is heightened in thecase of corporate staff counsel, lest the mere participationof an attorney be used to seal off disclosure. 
Id. at 420, 341 P.3d at 1220 (quoting Rossi v. Blue Cross &
Blue Shield of Greater N.Y., 540 N.E.2d 703, 705 (N.Y. 1989)). 
In addition, the supreme court has recognized the 
potential for conflict inherent in the tripartite relationship between insurer, insured and insurance defense counsel. See 
Finley v. Home Ins. Co., 90 Hawai# i 25, 29, 975 P.2d 1145, 1149 
(1998). "[R]etained counsel solely represents the insured when a conflict arises between the interests of the insurer and the insured." Id. at 32, 975 P.2d at 1152. 
These principles guide our analysis of the privilege 
claims asserted in GEICO's motion to reseal selected portions of the record. As to the first email in Exhibit 1, GEICO argued: 
The first document in Exhibit 1 contains confidential 
communications created by [Roy] - acting in his capacity asin-house counsel for [GEICO] - made for the purpose offacilitating his professional legal services between both[GEICO] and [GEICO's] insureds. Accordingly, it isprotected by the attorney-client privilege owned by [GEICO]and [GEICO's] insureds. 
As to the second email in Exhibit 1, GEICO argued: 
The second document in Exhibit 1 contains confidential 
communications to [Roy] solicited by [GEICO's] Staff CounselDirector requesting legal advice and analysis from [Roy] inhis capacity as [GEICO's] in-house counsel. This document is therefore likewise covered by the attorney-clientprivilege. 
GEICO made similar assertions of privilege regarding the 
paragraphs of the complaints it sought to reseal. Additionally,Hamburg stated in a declaration that: (1) "[Roy] managed  
16   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
litigation involving [GEICO's] insureds and effectively served as 
local in-house counsel for [GEICO]"; (2) "[Roy] worked in collaboration with other members of [GEICO's] Honolulu-based litigation department, including . . . Dornan, . . . [and] was supervised by . . . Dwyer"; (3) "[Roy] had as his client, on the one hand, [GEICO], and, simultaneously on the other hand, [GEICO's] insureds"; (4) "[i]n both these capacities, [Roy], Dornan, Dwyer and others routinely engaged in confidential legal strategy discussions subject to both the attorney-client privilege and/or the work-product privilege"; and (5) "[b]oth the Complaint and the Amended Complaint contained substantial and detailed information protected by the attorney-client privilege and/or the work-product privilege."
    10/
The Circuit Court described Exhibit 1 and concluded 
that it was not protected by the attorney-client privilege, as follows: 
a. Exhibit 1 to the complaint and amended complaint is a
compilation of two emails: 
i. the email from Roy to his supervisor, Dwyer,
dated August 19, 2012, is not a communicationmade for the purpose of facilitating therendition of professional legal services by Royto GEICO. GEICO did not solicit legal advicefrom Roy; the email is a discussion betweenGEICO's staff counsel and his supervisorquestioning GEICO's policy about what staffcounsel may tell staff counsel's client —GEICO's insured — about whether GEICO will indemnify its insured for liability in excess ofthe insured's policy limit in cases where GEICOrejects a policy limits settlement demand, orwhere GEICO refuses to agree to arbitrationpursuant to HRS § 431:l0C-213.5. It did not "originate . . . in response to [GEICO's]consultation about a particular problem" but aspart of a discussion about Roy's "ongoing,permanent relationship with [GEICO]." Anastasi 
I, 134 Hawai #i at 420. It is not protected by
GEICO's attorney-client privilege. 
ii. the email from Dwyer to Roy, dated October 24,2007 and copied to Beamer, is not acommunication made for the purpose offacilitating the rendition of professional legalservices by Roy to GEICO. GEICO did not solicit legal advice from Roy; Dwyer was telling Roy how 
10/ We note that the Hamburg declaration is part of the public record
on appeal. 
17 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Dwyer wanted Roy to do his job. The email 
contains the allegedly slanderous statements("smell like you are running scared" . . . "youhave never had a jury trial and have areputation, deserved or not, that you don't wantto try a case" . . . "you are going to have totry a case someday — this is becomingembarrassing"), published to a third person(Beamer), upon which Roy's defamation claim wasbased. 
FOFs/COLs/Order at 19-20 (brackets in original; footnote 
omitted). 
Similarly, the Circuit Court ruled that none of the 
allegations contained in the complaints were protected by the attorney-client privilege because: 
None of the allegations . . . describe "confidential
communications made for the purpose of facilitating the
rendition of professional legal services [by Roy] to[GEICO]". HRE Rule 503(b). GEICO did not ask Roy for legaladvice. Roy did not provide legal advice to GEICO asGEICO's lawyer. The communications between Roy, Dwyer,Dornan and Dayton described in the complaint and amendedcomplaint concerned Roy's day-to-day employment by, andrelationship to, GEICO. 
Id. at 23-24 (brackets in original). 
Based on our review of the record, including the 
purportedly privileged communications, we conclude that the 
Circuit Court did not err in determining that GEICO failed to meet its burden to prove that the communications were made for the purpose of facilitating the rendition of professional legal services by Roy to GEICO. See Honolulu Civil Beat Inc., 146 
Hawai# i at 295, 463 P.3d at 952 ("Notwithstanding the 
Department's conclusory claims that the report was privileged and confidential, the record before this court . . . fails to establish that the Department was acting pursuant to a lawyer-client relationship when it prepared the report and provided it to the legislature.") 
In particular, given Roy's 
dual role as in-house counsel for GEICO and counsel for GEICO's insureds, it is not evident from the information provided by GEICO (i.e., the Hamburg declaration) or the communications themselves that each was made within the context of a lawyer-client relationship between Roy and GEICO. For example, the first email in Exhibit 1 reflects an August 2012 communication 
18 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
from Roy to Dwyer, his GEICO supervisor, "questioning GEICO's 
policy about what staff counsel may tell staff counsel's client — GEICO's insured — about [certain indemnification and arbitration issues.]" FOFs/COLs/Order at 19. It is not apparent from the email itself that Roy was communicating for the purpose of facilitating the rendition of professional legal services to GEICO.
11/ The second email in Exhibit 1 reflects an earlier, 
October 2007 communication from Dwyer to Roy (copied to Beamer) in which Dwyer was, primarily, "telling Roy how . . . to do his job." FOFs/COLs/Order at 20. GEICO notes that the email also references a "particular claim," but it is not evident from the email alone that Dwyer was communicating with Roy for the purpose of facilitating the rendition of professional legal services to GEICO. For similar reasons, the Circuit Court did not err in determining that GEICO failed to prove that the paragraphs of the complaints discussing Exhibit 1 and other communications to or from Roy were made for the purpose of facilitating the rendition of professional legal services by Roy to GEICO. 
Accordingly, the Circuit Court did not err in 
concluding that the e-mails contained in Exhibit 1 and the communications between Roy, Dwyer, Dornan and Dayton described in the complaints were not communications made for the purpose of facilitating the rendition of professional legal services by Roy to GEICO, and thus were not protected by GEICO's attorney-client privilege. 
2. Work-Product Doctrine 
GEICO contends that the Circuit Court erred in ruling 
that Exhibits 2, 4, and 6 and numerous paragraphs of the complaints were not protected from disclosure under the work 
11/ GEICO appears to contend that its request for legal advice was
implicit in the communications at issue. However, we cannot infer such a
request based solely on the contents of the communications, and GEICO hasprovided no other information or evidence supporting the existence of such arequest.

product doctrine.12/ 
As this court stated in Anastasi I: 
"The primary purpose of the work product rule is to prevent
exploitation of a party's efforts in preparing forlitigation[,]" Holmgren v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.,976 F.2d 573, 576 (9th Cir. 1992) (citation and internalquotation marks omitted), and to "protect writtenstatements, private memoranda and personal recollectionsprepared or formed by an adverse party's counsel in thecourse of his legal duties." Metzler Contracting Co. v.
Stephens, 642 F. Supp. 2d 1192, 1205 (D. Haw. 2009)(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
134 Hawai# i at 423, 341 P.3d at 1223 (footnote omitted). 
Hawaii's work-product doctrine is set forth in HRCP 
Rule 26, which provides, in relevant part: 
(b) Discovery Scope and Limits.  Unless otherwise 
limited by order of the court in accordance with theserules, the scope of discovery is as follows: 
(1) In General. 
(A) Parties may obtain discovery regarding any
matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subjectmatter involved in the pending action . . . . 
. . . . 
(4) Trial Preparation: Materials.  A party may obtain
discovery of documents, electronically stored information,and tangible things otherwise discoverable under subdivision(b)(1) of this Rule and prepared in anticipation oflitigation or for trial by or for another party or by or forthat other party's representative (including the otherparty's attorney, consultant, surety, indemnitor, insurer,or agent) only upon a showing that the party seekingdiscovery has substantial need of the materials in thepreparation of the party's case and that the party is unablewithout undue hardship to obtain the substantial equivalentof the materials by other means. 
In ordering discovery of
such materials when the required showing has been made, thecourt shall protect against disclosure of the mentalimpressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of anattorney or other representative of a party concerning thelitigation. 
"Thus, the relevant inquiry for determining whether a 
document can be protected by work product doctrine is whether the 
document was prepared in anticipation of litigation or trial." 
12/ GEICO asserts that the work-product doctrine applies to paragraphs
27-31, 33-34, and 35 of the Complaint and paragraphs 25-29, 31-32, and 33 of
the Amended Complaint based on derivative information contained in theexhibits. Additionally, GEICO claims the work-product doctrine applies toparagraphs 13, 23, 24, 34, 48-49, 52, 68-69, 88, 92, 94-96, and 98 of theComplaint and paragraphs 11, 21, 22, 32, 48-51, 57, 74-75, 92, 94, 96, and 98of the Amended Complaint.

This court has also made clear that "the burden of 
establishing work product protection lies with the proponent, and it must be specifically raised and demonstrated rather than asserted in a blanket fashion." Anastasi I, 134 Hawai# i at 425, 
341 P.3d at 1225 (brackets omitted) (quoting Holliday v. Extex

Here, GEICO asserted work-product protection in the 
Circuit Court, as follows: 
[T]he Complaint and the Amended Complaint both contain
extensive materials protected by the work-product doctrine.Specifically, Exhibit 2 contains strategy e-mails exchangedbetween members of Defendant's Honolulu litigation team inanticipation of litigation on behalf of multiple ofDefendant's insureds. As such, Exhibit 2 is protected bythe work-product privilege. 
Additionally, Exhibit 4 contains an e-mail from Mr.
Dwyer to Plaintiff prepared with regard to the appropriatelitigation strategy for Plaintiff's cases. Exhibit 6 contains Plaintiff's response to Mr. Dwyer expressing hisview on the appropriate litigation strategy with regard tohis litigation cases. Both Exhibit 4 and Exhibit 6 are therefore covered by work-product privilege because theexhibits were prepared in anticipation of litigation. 
GEICO further argued that several paragraphs of the complaints 
(identified supra) that discussed Exhibits 2, 4, and 6 contained 
21 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"derivative" work product, and that numerous other paragraphs of 
the complaints also contained protected work product. 
In her 
declaration, Hamburg generally asserted that "[b]oth the Complaint and the Amended Complaint contained substantial and detailed information protected by the attorney-client privilege and/or the work-product privilege." 
The Circuit Court described Exhibits 2, 4, and 6 as 
follows: 
b. Exhibit 2 to the complaint and amended complaint are
. . . compilations of emails: 
i. the email from Beamer to Roy dated August 18,
2011, and copied to White, Kaakua, Harimoto andDornan . . . is a discussion among GEICO's staffcounsel — copied to GEICO's claim handlers andtheir claim manager — about responding to aplaintiff's attorney's proposal for arbitrationpursuant to HRS § 431:l0C-213.5 in two pendingcases. . . . 
ii. Dornan's email response to Beamer and Roy, alsodated August 18, 2011, and also copied to White,Kaakua and Harimoto . . . is a directive from GEICO's Branch Claims Manager to two of GEICO'sstaff counsel about who within GEICO is authorized to decide on binding arbitration.

omitted). 
As to Exhibits 2, 4, and 6 and the identified 
paragraphs of the complaints, the Circuit Court concluded that 
"[n]one of the contents GEICO seeks to redact are protected by the 'work product' rule because they were not 'prepared [by GEICO] in anticipation of [this] litigation or for trial' of this lawsuit. 
HRCP Rule 26(b)(4)." Id. at 24 (some brackets added). 
On appeal, GEICO argues that these materials reflect 
discussions among GEICO's attorneys and representatives "concerning actions and strategies to pursue in specific litigation (the cases in which Roy represented GEICO's insureds) and the scope of legal advice that was appropriate (or legally required) to be given to GEICO's insureds during that representation." GEICO also takes issue with the Circuit Court's use of the word "this" in concluding that the materials at issue were not protected because they were not prepared in anticipation of this litigation. GEICO argues that the fact that the materials at issue were created in anticipation of different litigation does not abrogate the applicability of the work-product doctrine. 
GEICO is correct that the materials at issue need not 
have been prepared in anticipation of this litigation, meaning the lawsuit initiated by Roy's Complaint, if the materials are otherwise protected by the work-product doctrine. By its terms, HRCP Rule 26(b)(4) does not limit work-product protection to materials prepared for the case in which the materials are sought. Rather, to qualify for work-product protection, the materials at issue must be prepared: (1) "in anticipation of litigation or for trial," and (2) "by or for another party[,] or by or for that other party's representative[.]" HRCP Rule 26(b)(4). A number of federal courts have construed substantially similar language in Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) Rule 26(b)(3) as protecting materials prepared 
for any litigation or trial as long as they were prepared by or 
for a party to the litigation in which the protection is being asserted. See, e.g., In re California Public Utilities Comm'n, 
23 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
892 F.2d 778, 781 (9th Cir. 1989) ("[W]e conclude that [FRCP Rule 
26(b)(3)], on its face, limits its protection to one who is a party (or a party's representative) to the litigation in which discovery is sought."); 
Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Atlanta Gas 
Light Co., 248 F.R.D. 663, 667 (N.D. Ga. 2008) ("[C]ourts have generally found that documents produced in anticipation of litigating one case remain protected in a subsequent case if they were created by or for a party to the subsequent litigation." (citing cases)); see also FTC v. Grolier, Inc., 462 U.S. 19, 25 (1983) (stating in dicta: "[T]he literal language of [FRCP Rule 26(b)(3)] protects materials prepared for any litigation or trial as long as they were prepared by or for a party to the subsequent litigation." (citing 8 J. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2024, at 201 (1970))). Additionally, at least one court has recognized that federal work-product protection extends even to non-parties to the litigation in which the information is sought. See Federal Election Comm'n v. The 
Christian Coalition, 179 F.R.D. 22, 24 (D.D.C. 1998) ("The more considered view appears to be that work product protection applies (1) to materials prepared for any litigation; and that (2) because the rule applies equally to one-time litigants and repeat players, the protection survives the termination of the litigation for which it was prepared; and that under the rationale of Hickman[ v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495 (1947)], non-parties should be able to assert work product privilege claims even though Rule 26(b)(3) is phrased only in terms of the parties." (citations omitted)). 
Based on its non-limiting language, we hold that HRCP 
Rule 26(b)(4) protects materials prepared in anticipation of any litigation and survives the termination of the litigation for which it was prepared. We need not determine the precise contours of Hawaii's work-product doctrine, i.e., whether its protection extends to non-parties to the litigation in which the information is sought, because, here, it appears that Exhibits 2, 4, and 6 were prepared by individuals who either are or represent parties in this case. Thus, the materials at issue would qualify for work product protection under HRCP Rule 26(b)(4), as long as 
24 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
they were prepared in anticipation of litigation. 
Exhibits 2, 4, and 6 appear to be email communications 
to or from one or more in-house attorneys for GEICO who allegedly 
acted in a dual role. See
 FOFs/COLs/Order at 20-22. In these 
circumstances, where documents are claimed to serve a dual purpose, the "because of" test applies. See Anastasi II, 137 
Hawai# i at 113, 366 P.3d at 169. 
Dual purpose documents are deemed prepared because of
litigation if "in light of the nature of the documentand the factual situation in the particular case, thedocument can be fairly said to have been prepared orobtained because of the prospect of litigation." In applying the "because of" standard, courts mustconsider the totality of the circumstances anddetermine whether the "'document was created because of anticipated litigation, and would not have beencreated in substantially similar form but for theprospect of litigation.'" 
United States v. Richey, 632 F.3d 559, 567–68 (9th Cir.2011)(citations omitted). 
Id. (quoting Anastasi I, 134 Hawai# i at 425, 341 P.3d at 1225). 
The supreme court has further explained: 
Under the "because of" test, courts are instructed toconsider whether given the totality of the circumstances itcan be fairly said that a document was prepared or obtainedbecause of the prospect of litigation. This test alignswith the scope of the privilege as circumscribed in HRCPRule 26 because the statutory privilege protects onlymaterials prepared in anticipation of litigation or fortrial. 
Id. at 114, 366 P.3d at 170. 
Here, GEICO submitted Exhibits 2, 4, and 6 for the 
Circuit Court's in camera review, but did not otherwise submit 
any evidence regarding "the factual situation in the particular case" or cases allegedly involved in these communications or in the parts of the complaints that GEICO sought to redact. Id. at 
113, 366 P.3d at 169. We are thus left to infer that Exhibit 2 concerns "actions and strategies to pursue in specific litigation . . . in which Roy represented GEICO's insureds[,]" despite the fact that the subject matter of this email compilation appears to relate primarily to GEICO's policy regarding "who within GEICO is authorized to decide on binding arbitration [proposals]." FOFs/COLs/Order at 20-21. Similarly, we are left to speculate 
25   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that Exhibits 4 and 6 concern litigation that Roy was handling 
for GEICO's insureds, despite the fact that these emails appear primarily to reflect Dwyer "again telling Roy how . . . to do his job[,]" and Roy acknowledging that directive and "questioning allegedly retaliatory and discriminatory adverse employment actions taken by GEICO[.]" Id. at 22. In short, the substance 
of the disputed materials appears to concern the broader question of whether Roy could independently exercise his role as counsel for his clients (the GEICO insureds), or whether GEICO could control certain aspects of how he handled representing clients in third-party cases. "[I]t is well established that documents prepared in the ordinary course of business are not protected by the work-product doctrine because they would have been created regardless of the litigation." Anastasi II, 137 Hawai# i at 112, 
366 P.3d at 168 (quoting Anastasi I, 134 Hawai# i at 425, 341 P.3d 
at 1225). 
Based on our review of the record, including Exhibits 
2, 4, and 6, we conclude that GEICO failed to carry its burden of establishing that the materials it sought to reseal or redact "w[ere] created because of anticipated litigation, and would not have been created in substantially similar form but for the prospect of litigation." Anastasi II, 137 Hawai# i at 113, 366 
P.3d at 169 (quoting Anastasi I, 134 Hawai# i at 425, 341 P.3d at 
1225). Accordingly, the Circuit Court did not err in concluding that Exhibits 2, 4, and 6 and the identified paragraphs of the complaints were not protected by the work-product 
doctrine.13/ 
3. Trade Secrets 
GEICO also contends that the Circuit Court erred in 
failing to recognize that parts of the complaints contained trade secrets and should have been protected from public disclosure on 
13/ Relatedly, the Circuit Court's use of the word "this" in
concluding that the materials at issue were not protected because they were
not prepared in anticipation of this litigation was harmless error.

that basis.14/ 
HRE Rule 508 states: 
Trade secrets.  A person has a privilege, which may be
claimed by the person or the person's agent or employee, to
refuse to disclose and to prevent other persons fromdisclosing a trade secret owned by the person, if allowanceof the privilege will not tend to conceal fraud or otherwisework injustice. When disclosure is directed, the judgeshall take such protective measure as the interests of theholder of the privilege and of the parties and thefurtherance of justice may require. 
HRS § 482B-2 (2008) defines a "trade secret" as 
follows: 
"Trade secret" means information, including a formula,
pattern, compilation, program device, method, technique, orprocess that: 
(1) Derives independent economic value, actual orpotential, from not being generally known to,and not being readily ascertainable by propermeans by, other persons who can obtain economicvalue from its disclosure or use; and 
(2) Is the subject of efforts that are reasonableunder the circumstances to maintain its secrecy. 
Here, GEICO argued below that the complaints "reveal 
[GEICO's] trade secrets with regard to managing litigation; 
specific techniques and alleged practices for creating and enforcing GEICO's internal policies; and metrics for ensuring control of costs and calculating remuneration of employees." It does not appear that GEICO submitted any evidence supporting its trade secret claims. 
The Circuit Court concluded that "[n]one of the 
contents GEICO seek to redact constitute 'trade secrets.'" FOFs/COLs/Order at 24. The court reasoned: 
a. GEICO have not shown that the information is novel or 
materially different from the litigation strategies,premium collection procedures or compensation plans oftheir competitors. See Woo[ v. Fireman's Fund Ins.
Co.], 154 P.3d [236,] 240[ (Wash. Ct. App. 2007)]. 
14/ GEICO asserts that the following portions of the complaints contain
trade secrets: paragraphs 13, 23-31, 33-35, 37-41, 44, 48-49, 52, 68-69, 86,88, 90, 92, 94-96, and 100 of the Complaint, and paragraphs 11, 21-29,31-33,35-41, 44, 48-53, 57, 74-75, 92, 94, 98, 100-102, and 104 of the AmendedComplaint. 
27 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
GEICO have not, for example, submitted declarations
establishing that its litigation strategies, premiumcollection procedures or compensation plans arematerially different from those of State FarmInsurance Company, or Farmers Insurance Company, orother of GEICO's competitors in the liabilityinsurance marketplace. 
b. GEICO have not shown that the information, if obtainedby GEICO's business competitors, would unfairly hinderGEICO's ability to compete in the liability insurancemarketplace. 
c. GEICO have not shown that they expended significantamounts of time, money or other commercial resourcesto generate, develop or compile the information. 
Id. 
On appeal, GEICO reiterates that the information it 
seeks to protect "is about methods, techniques, and processes 
GEICO uses in very specific contexts to manage claims (including in litigation), enforce its own internal policies, and control costs." However, GEICO submitted no evidence below to support its counsel's naked assertions that GEICO's claims management strategies and other internal policies meet the definition of a trade secret under HRS § 482B-2. Conclusory claims such as these are insufficient to establish the existence of a trade secret. See, e.g., Kona's Best Nat. Coffee LLC v. Mountain Thunder Coffee Plantation Int'l, Inc., No. CAAP-12-0000593, 2017 WL 3310451, at *19 (App. 2017) (mem.) ("The Mountain Thunder Defendants did not present specific evidence of the information they claimed constituted trade secrets or why such information qualified as trade secrets."); McCallum v. Allstate Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co., 204 P.3d 944, 951 (Wash. Ct. App. 2009) ("The conclusory statements and unsubstantiated assertions in [the Allstate employees'] declarations are insufficient to establish the documents contained trade secrets."). 
On this record, we conclude that GEICO failed to meet 
its burden to prove that the information in the complaints that it sought to redact constituted trade secrets. Accordingly, the Circuit Court did not err in so ruling.
