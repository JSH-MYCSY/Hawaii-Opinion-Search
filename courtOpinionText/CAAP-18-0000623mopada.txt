Dismiss for Deminimis [sic] Infraction (Motion to Dismiss), which 
the Circuit Court granted, dismissing the charge with prejudice.  
On appeal, the State requests that this court vacate the Dismissal Order and remand the case for trial. I. BACKGROUND 
On March 7, 2018, by Felony Information, the State 
charged Ruben with having violated HRS § 712-1243 on or about November 16, 2017, by knowingly possessing methamphetamine.  On June 21, 2018, Ruben filed the Motion to Dismiss, reciting the following factual assertions: 
a.  That on November 16, 2017, [Ruben] allegedly was
observed by HPD officer Doulgas Korenic to be possessing a
glass pipe in his left hand and a lighter in his right hand;
b.  That Officer Korenic allegedly observed [Ruben]
place said pipe and lighter in a hat on the ground;
c.  That Officer Korenic allegedly observed
methamphetamine residue in said glass pipe;
d.  Officer Korenic never observed [Ruben] lighting
the pipe, placing it to his mouth or otherwise smoking fromsaid glass pipe; 
e.  No other packets or evidence of methamphetamine
were found on [Ruben]; 
. . . . h.  The weight of the residue in the pipe was 0.010 
grams;
i.  No further testing was conducted to determine the
actual quantity or percentage of methamphetamine in theresidue[.] 
Ruben asserted that the amount of methamphetamine 
residue recovered and the surrounding circumstances warranted 
dismissal of the charge as a de minimis infraction pursuant to 
2(...continued)
dangerous drug in the third degree if the person knowingly
possesses any dangerous drug in any amount.
(2)  Promoting a dangerous drug in the third degree is
a class C felony. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRS § 702-236 (2014).   In its memorandum in opposition to the 
Motion to Dismiss, the State recited the following factual 
assertions: 3
a. On November 16, 2017, [HPD] Officer Douglas Korenic
(hereinafter "Officer Korenic") was making checks ofKauluwela Mall for park closure violations. 
b. Officer Korenic from 15 feet observed [Ruben] sittingin a chair on the Ewa side of the narrow mall. 
c.  Officer Korenic observed in [Ruben]'s left hand asmall clear glass cylindrical object with a bulbousend. 
d.  Officer Korenic observed a white powdery burnt residueinside the pipe. 
e.  Officer Korenic observed in [Ruben]'s right hand a red"BIC" lighter. 
f.  When Officer Korenic illuminated the area he observed [Ruben] attempt to conceal the pipe inside the hat onhis lap. . . . . 
i.  On November 20, 2017, HPD Criminalist MichelleShinsato analyzed the substance found within the pipeand determined it contained methamphetamine and thatit had a net weight of 0.01 grams. 
The State argued that "the totality of the 
circumstances suggests [Ruben's] conduct did in fact cause or 
threaten the harm sought to be prevented" by HRS § 712-1243 and that Ruben had failed to meet his burden to show that the amount of methamphetamine in his possession, along with the attendant 
3 HRS § 702-236 provides: 
§ 702-236  De minimis infractions.  (1) The court may
dismiss a prosecution if, having regard to the nature of the
conduct alleged and the nature of the attendantcircumstances, it finds that the defendant's conduct:
(a) Was within a customary license or tolerance,which was not expressly refused by the personwhose interest was infringed and which is notinconsistent with the purpose of the lawdefining the offense; 
(b) Did not actually cause or threaten the harm orevil sought to be prevented by the law definingthe offense or did so only to an extent tootrivial to warrant the condemnation of conviction; or 
(c) Presents such other extenuations that it cannot reasonably be regarded as envisaged by thelegislature in forbidding the offense. 
(2)  The court shall not dismiss a prosecution under
subsection (1)(c) of this section without filing a writtenstatement of its reasons. 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
circumstances, warranted dismissal as a de minimis violation.  
The State attached a copy of the Honolulu Police Department (HPD) 
Official Report for the scientific testing conducted on the 
substance recovered from the pipe and a 2002 transcript of testimony by Dr. Kevin Ho (Dr. Ho) in another case. 
During a July 3, 2018 hearing on the motion, the 
parties stipulated to the facts of the case as follows: 
THE COURT: . . . Both of you in your declarations
essentially recite factual circumstances which are not -- I
mean, they basically comport with each other.
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  Yes. THE COURT:  Do we both agree that those are the
facts that I can use to consider the relevant circumstances associated with this motion? 
[DEPUTY PROSECUTING ATTORNEY]:  Yes, Your Honor. 
There was no testimony at the hearing. 
In support of his motion, Ruben argued that the amount 
of methamphetamine he possessed at the time that Officer Keronic 
observed him with the pipe and lighter was not a "criminal offense worthy of a Class C felony."  Ruben acknowledged that, unlike the State, he did not include with his Motion to Dismiss any expert testimony with respect to the pharmacological effects of the amount of residue in the pipe.  He argued, however, that the amount is "
de minimis or it's not" and that his past or 
future use of the drug was not a relevant consideration.  In opposition, the State argued that .01 grams of methamphetamine is not a de minimis amount. 
Following the arguments by the parties, the Circuit 
Court granted the motion and dismissed the charge with prejudice. On July 13, 2018, the Circuit Court entered the Dismissal Order, in which it found and concluded as follows, in pertinent part: 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Factual Findings 
On November 16, 2017, [HPD] Officer Douglas Korenic
encountered [Ruben] at Kauluwela Mall, a City and County of
Honolulu community park located at 198 North VineyardBoulevard in downtown Honolulu.  
From approximately fifteen feet away, Officer Korenic
saw Ruben sitting in a chair within the park.  
[Officer Korenic] noticed that Ruben had a small,
clear glass cylindrical object with a bulbous end in hisleft hand and a lighter in his right hand.  He then saw Ruben place the pipe and the lighter in a hat on his lap. 
Officer Korenic recovered the pipe, which he observed
to contain white burnt residue.  
No other items typically associated with illicit drug
commerce, use or paraphernalia (see HRS § 329-43.5)
4 were 
recovered. 
. . . . 
Ruben was not observed to light or smoke the object in
the pipe, and there is an absence of evidence that the pipe
was hot or warm to the touch, thereby suggesting recentusage.  
Ruben was not observed to be under the influence of 
any illicit substance when he was arrested.  He was also not engaged in the commission of any property or violent crime. 
Subsequent scientific analysis by a [HPD] criminalist
determined that the object within the pipe containedmethamphetamine.  It weighed .010 grams.  There was no analysis as to the quantity of methamphetamine comprisingthe .010 grams. 
. . . . 
Legal Conclusions 
. . . . 
Although Ruben's alleged possession of an object
containing methamphetamine in an unspecified amount is tentimes the amount at issue in [State v. Viernes, 92 
Hawai #i 
130, 988 P.2d 195 (1999)], the 1000% increase in themethamphetamine possessed by Ruben totaled only 10/1000th or1/100th of a gram.  Viernes supports an HRS § 702-236 dismissal. 
. . . . 
The Hawai #i Penal Code quantifies illegal possession
by measurement in ounces (or grams) - not tenths of grams,or hundreds of grams, or thousandths of grams.  It is clear that under the circumstances, and considering the statutoryscheme as a whole, Ruben's possession of .010 grams of asubstance containing methamphetamine eclipses the "anyamount" element of HRS § 712-1243.  Ruben's possession did 
4 HRS § 329-43.5 (Supp. 2018) addresses prohibited acts related to
drug paraphernalia. 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
not actually cause or threaten the harm sought to be
prevented by the law.  But even if it did, it did so only toan extent too trivial to warrant the condemnation of conviction. 
. . . . 
The court concludes that under the attendant 
circumstances of this case, and considering the Hawai #i 
Penal Code as a whole, HRS § 702-236 justifies dismissal in
Ruben's case, where he purportedly possessed 1/100 of a gramof an object containing an unknown amount ofmethamphetamine.  Ruben should not be subject to felony prosecution. 
It is clear cut that "[a]ll the relevant
circumstances" must be considered with respect to assessing
a de minimis  infraction claim.  See, e.g., [State v. Vance,
61 Haw. 291, 307, 602 P.2d 933, 944 (1979)].  Vance and the 
cases that followed deemed the ability or inability to useor sell the narcotic as a critical inquiry.  Id. . . . "[W]ith respect to the amount of drugs possessed, the proper
inquiry in de minimis  cases is whether the amount possessed
could produce a pharmacological or physiological effect ." 
. . . . 
The prosecution submitted as Exhibit 2 a transcript of
the 2002 testimony of Dr. Kevin Ho in a related case.  The 
defense did not submit a transcript, but alluded to the
expert testimony of Dr. George Read [(Dr. Read)], who insimilar cases around the turn of the century testified (forthe most part) in contravention of Dr. Ho. 
[fn] 17  In similar motions to dismiss on de 
minimis  grounds in this court and in other courts,
transcripts encompassing the testimony of Dr. Readhave been received.  The appellate courts are alsofamiliar with the competing views of Doctors Ho andRead. 
The court is uncertain as to the continued reliability
of the aged opinions by these experts, but considers theexpert testimony in its analysis. 
The court finds that there is an inability to use or
sell the infinitesimal quantity of the object containingsome methamphetamine within the pipe held by Ruben.  In that there is a lack of evidence as to the quantity of actualmethamphetamine within the pipe comprising the 1/100 gram of"residue" containing methamphetamine, the court cannot find
that the object within the pipe is capable of producing a
pharmacological or physiological effect.  
[fn] 18  It is reasonable to infer that a 
methamphetamine user would have consumed themethamphetamine (or shared or sold it) if themicroscopic traces of methamphetamine would haveresulted in a "high," or had a pharmacological orphysiological effect.  Thus, it is reasonable toconclude that Ruben (or someone else) would haveingested the barely discernable residue had there beena pharmacological or physiological effect.  It is 
unreasonable to suggest that .010 grams of a substance
containing methamphetamine is capable of sale as a
narcotic. 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
. . . . 
Further, there were not any items typically associated
with drug use that were uncovered from Ruben.  While he had 
a lighter in his hand, there was no evidence that at anytime he ignited (or attempted to ignite) the pipe with thelighter.  The pipe was not warm, there were no plumes ofsmoke or methamphetamine odors, and Ruben was not observedto be under the influence of any illicit drug. . . .  Also,Ruben did not possess any accompanying paraphernalia, suchas transparent storage baggies, "scrapers," or other HRS§ 329-43.5 related items. . . .  He was also not engaged in drug vending. 
(Some footnotes omitted; emphasis added; format altered). 
II. POINTS OF ERROR 
On appeal, the State contends that the Circuit Court 
abused its discretion in granting the Motion to Dismiss by erroneously:  (1) interpreting HRS § 712-1243 and concluding that the critical inquiry is whether the illicit drug was usable or saleable; (2) finding that .010 grams of methamphetamine was an amount incapable of producing a pharmacological or physiological effect; and (3) concluding that there were not any items typically associated with drug use recovered from Ruben. III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
"'A court's decision under HRS § 702-236 is reviewed 
for abuse of discretion.'"  State v. Viernes, 92 Hawai# i 130, 
133, 988 P.2d 195, 198 (1999) (quoting State v. Ornellas, 79 Hawai# i 418, 420, 903 P.2d 723, 725 (App. 1995)).  "'The trial 
court abuses its discretion if it bases its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.'"  State v. Kealoha, 142 Hawai# i 46, 55, 414 P.3d 
98, 107 (2018) (quoting Allstate Ins. Co. v. Pruett, 118 Hawai# i 
174, 179, 186 P.3d 609, 614 (2008)).  "In other words, '[a]n abuse of discretion occurs where the trial court has clearly 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles 
of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant.'"  Id. (quoting Allstate Ins. Co., 118 Hawai# i at 179, 
186 P.3d at 614). 
"Before a trial court can address whether to dismiss a 
prosecution on de minimis 
 grounds, it must first make factual 
determinations regarding both the conduct alleged and the attendant circumstances, which are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard."  State v. Carmichael, 99 Hawai# i 75, 79, 53 
P.3d 214, 218 (2002) (citing Viernes, 92 Hawai
#i at 133, 988 P.2d 
at 198).  A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when: "'(1) the record lacks substantial evidence to support the finding, or (2) despite substantial evidence in support of the finding, the appellate court is nonetheless left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.'"  State v. Sanford, 97 Hawai# i 247, 253, 35 P.3d 764, 770 (App. 2001) (quoting State v. 
Okumura, 78 Hawai# i 383, 392, 894 P.2d 80, 89 (1995)). 
"A trial court's conclusions of law are reviewed de 
novo, under the right/wrong standard of review."  State v. Kido, 109 Hawai# i 458, 461, 128 P.3d 340, 343 (2006) (citations 
omitted).  "A conclusion of law that is supported by the trial court's findings of fact and that reflects an application of the correct rule of law will not be overturned."  Dan v. State, 76 Hawai# i
 423, 428, 879 P.2d 528, 533 (1994) (internal quotation 
marks and citations omitted).

III. DISCUSSION 
A. Legal Standard for De Minimis Drug Violation 
The State argues that the Circuit Court erred in 
applying an incorrect legal standard for its de minimis determination.  Specifically, the State argues that the Circuit Court erroneously interpreted HRS § 712-1243 and improperly applied a useable or saleable quantity standard to the amount of methamphetamine in Ruben's possession to erroneously concluding that his possession of .010 grams of methamphetamine "eclipses the 'any amount' element of HRS § 712-1243."  This argument lacks merit. 
The Hawai# i Supreme Court has held that "the direct and 
unambiguous language of [HRS § 712-1243] prohibits [the Court] from judicially amending the provision to include a useable quantity standard" and thus "the State must prove only the knowing possession of a dangerous drug in any amount" in order to obtain a conviction.  State v. Vance, 61 Haw. 291, 307, 602 P.2d 933, 944 (1979).  Notwithstanding this holding, a court "may dismiss a prosecution if, considering all the relevant circumstances, it finds that the defendant's conduct did not actually cause or threaten the harm sought to be prevented by the law or did so only to an extent too trivial to warrant the condemnation of conviction" pursuant to HRS § 702-236.  Id.; Viernes, 92 Hawai# i at 135, 988 P.2d at 200 ("[C]onduct may be so 
harmless that, although it technically violates HRS § 712-1243, it is nonetheless de minimis pursuant to HRS § 702-236.").  
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
With regards to the harm sought to be prevented by HRS 
§ 712-1243, the Hawai# i Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized 
that "Hawaii's drug laws were intended to control the use and 
sale of illicit drugs."  State v. Fukagawa, 100 
Hawai# i 498, 504-
05, 60 P.3d 899, 905-06 (2002); Sanford, 97 Hawai# i at 256, 35 
P.3d at 773; Viernes, 92 Hawai# i at 134, 988 P.2d at 199; Vance, 
61 Haw. at 307, 602 P.2d at 944.  However, "if the quantity of a controlled substance is so minuscule that it cannot be sold or used in such a way as to have any discernible effect on the human body, it follows that the drug cannot lead to abuse."  Viernes, 92 Hawai# i at 134, 988 P.2d at 199.  Therefore, "with respect to 
the amount of drugs possessed, the proper inquiry in de minimis cases is whether the amount possessed could produce a pharmacological or physiological effect."  Fukagawa, 100 Hawai# i 
at 506, 60 P.3d at 907. 
Here, the Circuit Court recognized that "the proper 
inquiry in de minimis cases is whether the amount possessed could produce a pharmacological or physiological effect" and proceeded to address the facts of the case utilizing that standard.  Thus, while the Circuit Court may not have accurately described the legal standard for a conviction under HRS § 712-1243, it did not employ an erroneous legal standard for a de minimis determination.  See Viernes, 92 Hawai# i at 134, 988 P.2d 415 at 
199 ("[u]nder certain circumstances, [a 
de minimis violation] 
may, as Vance suggests, trump the 'any amount' requirement of HRS § 712-1243").  Accordingly, the State's first and second points of error are rejected. 
10  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
B. Whether Ruben's Conduct Warranted Dismissal 
The State contends that the Circuit Court erroneously 
determined that the .01 grams of methamphetamine in Ruben's possession was an amount incapable of producing a pharmacological or physiological effect. Specifically, the State argues that 
there was no evidence in the record to support this finding and 
that the Circuit Court relied on evidence not in the record to make its finding. The State also argues that the Circuit Court 
improperly relied on the "lack of evidence as to the quantity of 
actual methamphetamine within the pipe," because it was Ruben's burden to demonstrate that the purity of the methamphetamine was less than an amount that would produce a physiological or pharmacological effect. 
As noted above, the harm sought to be prevented by HRS 
§ 712-1243 is, 
inter alia, the use of illicit substances and 
"their sale or transfer for ultimate use."  Vance, 61 Haw. at 307, 602 P.2d at 944.  As the movant in de minimis cases, the defendant bears the burden of proof on the issue and must present evidence that the amount possessed was incapable of producing a pharmacological or physiological effect.  State v. Oughterson, 99 Hawai# i 244, 256, 54 P.3d 415, 427 (2002); see also State v.
Hironaka, 99 
Hawai# i 198, 209, 53 P.3d 806, 817 (2002) (affirming 
the trial court's denial of defendant's de minimis motion to dismiss when the defendant adduced no evidence that the amount of methamphetamine he was charged with possessing was incapable of producing a pharmacological or physiological effect or was not saleable); State v. Balanza, 93 Hawai# i 279, 283-85, 1 P.3d 281, 
11  
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
285-87 (2000) (holding that the trial court did not abuse its 
discretion in denying defendant's motion to dismiss on de minimis grounds when his expert witness' testimony was inadmissible). Additionally, "the defendant must address both 'the nature of the conduct alleged and the nature of the attendant circumstances.'" Fukagawa, 100 Hawai# i at 507, 60 P.3d at 908 (quoting HRS § 702-
236(1)).  Dismissal of a charge without any indicators from the surrounding circumstances constitutes an abuse of discretion. Id. 
Here, the Circuit Court appears to have recognized the 
harm sought to be prevented by HRS § 712-1243 as the use of drugs and their sale or transfer for ultimate use. However, the 
Circuit Court's finding that the .01 grams of a substance 
containing methamphetamine in Ruben's possession was incapable of producing a pharmacological or physiological effect
5 was clearly 
erroneous because it was not supported by the evidence. 
In making its finding, the Circuit Court referred to 
the transcript testimony of Dr. Ho submitted by the State and noted that Ruben did not submit any transcript but "alluded to the expert testimony of [Dr. Read] . . . in contravention of Dr. Ho." (Footnote omitted.) The Circuit Court noted that "[i]n 
similar motions to dismiss on de minimis grounds in this court 
and in other courts, transcripts encompassing the testimony of Dr. Read have been received." The Circuit Court then stated its 
5 More precisely, the Circuit Court found "that there is an
inability to use or sell the infinitesimal quantity of the object containing
some methamphetamine within the pipe held by Ruben" and stated that it "cannotfind that the object within the pipe is capable of producing a pharmacologicalor physiological effect" due to the lack of evidence as to the quantity ofactual methamphetamine within the pipe. 
12 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
uncertainty "as to the continued reliability of the aged opinions 
by these experts" but stated it would "consider[] the expert testimony in its analysis." 
Notably, however, Ruben at no time presented a copy of 
the testimony of Dr. Read.  Ruben also did not present evidence of any specific statements by Dr. Read as to the effect of certain amounts of methamphetamine on the human body. Consequently, the testimony of Dr. Read was not evidence in this case as to the pharmacological or physiological effects of the methamphetamine in Ruben's possession.   Ruben presented no other 
evidence or testimony as to the effects of methamphetamine.  The evidence presented by the State includes testimony from Dr. Ho that an amount as low as .002 grams of inhaled methamphetamine could produce a pharmacological effect. 
6
The Circuit Court nevertheless focused on the "lack of 
evidence as to the quantity of actual methamphetamine within the pipe comprising the 1/100 gram of 'residue' containing 
6 To the extent the Circuit Court was purporting to exercise its
discretionary authority to take judicial notice of Dr. Read's conclusions as
to the effects of methamphetamine, we note that, pursuant to Hawai #i Rules of 
Evidence ( HRE) Rule 201, judicial notice may only be taken of "adjudicative
facts," which are, inter alia , those "capable of accurate and ready
determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably bequestioned."  HRE Rule 201(b)(2).  We conclude that the pharmacological andphysiological effects of methamphetamine are not facts "whose accuracy cannotreasonably be questioned" in light of the testimony of Dr. Ho.  Additionally,"[f]actual allegations, conclusions, and findings, whether authored by thecourt, by the parties or their attorneys, or by third persons, should not benoticed to prove the truth of the matters asserted, even though the materialhappens to be contained in court records."  Addison M. Bowman, Hawaii Rules ofEvidence Manual § 201-5[4] (2016-2017 ed.) (citing Ditto v. McCurdy, 98Hawai #i 123, 130, 44 P.3d 274, 281 (2002); State v. Kotis, 91 Hawai #i 319, 342,
984 P.2d 78, 101 (1999) (mental health experts' affidavits contained incircuit court file in same case did not qualify for judicial notice)).  As the supreme court has recently reiterated, "'[a] distinction must be carefullydrawn between taking judicial notice of the existence of documents in theCourt file as opposed to the truth of the facts asserted in those documents.'" Uyeda v. Schermer, 144 Hawai #i 163, 172, 439 P.3d 115, 124 (2019) (quoting 
Kotis, 91 Hawai #i at 342, 984 P.2d at 101). 
13 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
methamphetamine" for its determination that it could not find 
that "the object within the pipe is capable of producing a pharmacological or physiological effect."  The Circuit Court did not err in finding that the quantity of actual methamphetamine in Ruben's possession was unknown based on the undisputed fact that no additional testing was conducted on the substance recovered from the pipe.  See Viernes, 92 Hawai# i at 134 n.5, 988 P.3d at 
199 n.5.  However, a lack of evidence as to the actual amount of methamphetamine in Ruben's possession does not necessarily support a finding that the amount of the substance containing methamphetamine was incapable of producing a discernible effect on the human body, absent some evidence of the effects of that substance. 
It is the defendant's burden of proof on the issue of 
whether he is entitled to a dismissal of the charge on de minimis grounds, which he may carry "by establishing, within the context of 'considering all the relevant circumstances,' that the quantum of the controlled substance at issue '(1) could not produce any pharmacological action or physiological effect and (2) was not saleable.'"  Oughterson, 99 
Hawai# i at 256, 54 P.3d at 427 
(emphasis added) (quoting Viernes, 92 Hawai# i at 134-35, 988 P.2d 
at 199-200).  Accordingly, it was Ruben's burden to present at least some evidence as to the effects of methamphetamine or of the specific substance in his possession containing methamphetamine in order for the record to support a finding that the substance could not possibly produce a discernible effect on the human body.  Cf. Viernes, 92 Hawai# i at 134, 988 P.2d at 199 
14  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(relying on the defendant's uncontroverted evidence as to the 
effects of .001 grams of methamphetamine to support the Circuit Court's finding); see also Fukagawa, 100 Hawai# i at 506, 60 P.3d 
at 907 (recognizing that defendant's expert (also Dr. Read) did not testify that the substance recovered in that case could not produce a pharmacological effect); Hironaka, 99 
Hawai# i at 209, 
53 P.3d at 817 (addressing the defendant's failure to adduce any evidence that the amount of methamphetamine he was charged with possession was incapable of producing a pharmacological or physiological effect or was not saleable).  
Moreover, the Circuit Court appears to have also relied 
on Ruben's status as a purported methamphetamine user to infer that Ruben would have already ingested the substance in his possession if it were capable of producing a "high." However, 
Ruben did not testify and there was no evidence presented as to 
his status as a methamphetamine user or that, as a purported methamphetamine user, he necessarily would have ingested any amount of methamphetamine simply because it was in his possession and potentially capable of producing a pharmacological or physiological effect. 
Because there was no evidence in the record to support 
the Circuit Court's finding, it clearly erred.  Although the Circuit Court made other findings as to the surrounding circumstances of Ruben's conduct, we cannot conclude that the Circuit Court's inclusion of and reliance on its erroneous 
15 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
finding was harmless error.   See State v. Enos, CAAP-18-0000407, 
2019 WL 1923705, *2 (Haw. App. Apr. 30, 2019) (SDO). 
Accordingly, the Dismissal Order must be vacated. 7
IV. CONCLUSION 
Based on the foregoing, the Circuit Court's July 13,

7 We note, as the State argues, that the Circuit Court erroneously
stated that "there were not any items typically associated with drug use that
were uncovered from Ruben," even though the Circuit Court made findings thatRuben possessed a lighter and pipe.  However, as the Circuit Court recited and
appears to have relied upon these factual findings in its assessment of thesurrounding circumstances, its misstatement was harmless.  See Fukagawa, 100 Hawai #i at 506 n.11, 60 P.3d at 907 n.11.
