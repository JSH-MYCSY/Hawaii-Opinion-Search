SIMIN NAJIBI, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
H
ONOLULU DIVISION 
(CASE NO. 1DTC-16-073875) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, and Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Simin Najibi (Najibi
) appeals from 
the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment,1/ 
filed on July 19, 2017, and the Notice of Entry of Judgment 
and/or Order and Plea/Judgment,2/ filed on July 20, 2018, in the 
District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division (District 
Court). 
Following a bench trial, Najibi was convicted of 
Accidents Involving Bodily Injury, in violation of Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS) ยง 291C-12.6(a) (2007).3/ 
1/ The Honorable Thomas A. Haia presided.

On appeal, Najibi contends that: 
(1) the District Court's colloquy with her was insufficient 
to obtain a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of her right to a jury trial; 
(2) there was insufficient evidence to support her conviction; 
(3) the District Court erred in ordering restitution because: (a) the complaining witness's (CW) losses were not the 
result of Najibi's criminal conduct; 
(b) the CW's losses were not reasonable and verified; 
and 
(c) the court failed to consider Najibi's financial ability to make restitution for the purpose of establishing the time and manner of payment; and 
(4) the District Court erred in "interjecting itself into the trial" by questioning the CW at trial and at the restitution hearing, and "exhibit[ing] bias for the State." Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve Najibi's points of error as follows: 
In State v. Torres, 144 Hawai# i 282, 439 P.3d 234 
(2019), the supreme court stated: 
It is well established that Hawai #i law recognizes the right
to a jury trial as a fundamental right. State v. Ibuos, 75
Haw. 118, 120, 857 P.2d 576, 577 (1993). This right cannot
be relinquished absent a knowing, intelligent, and voluntarywaiver. State v. Friedman, 93 Hawai #i 63, 68, 996 P.2d 268,
273 (2000). A waiver is knowing and intelligent when it ismade with "full awareness of both the nature of the rightbeing abandoned and the consequences of the decision to

the scene of the accident or as close thereto as possiblebut shall then forthwith return to and in every event shallremain at the scene of the accident until the driver has fulfilled the requirements of section 291C-14. Every suchstop shall be made without obstructing traffic more than isnecessary. 
(b) Any person who violates subsection (a) shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor.

abandon it." Moran v. Burbine, 475 U.S. 412, 421, 106 S.Ct.
1135, 89 L.Ed.2d 410 (1986). A waiver is voluntary when "it
was the product of a free and deliberate choice rather thanintimidation, coercion, or deception." Id. 
When determining whether the waiver of a jury trial is
knowing, intelligent, and voluntary, we have "advised thetrial courts to conduct Duarte-Higareda's suggestedcolloquy." State v. Gomez-Lobato, 130 Hawai #i 465, 470,
312 P.3d 897, 902 (2013) (citing Friedman, 93 Hawai #i at 69,
996 P.2d at 274). 
In a Duarte-Higareda
 colloquy, the trial
court informs the defendant "that (1) twelve members of thecommunity compose a jury, (2) the defendant may take part injury selection, (3) a jury verdict must be unanimous, and(4) the court alone decides guilt or innocence if thedefendant waives a jury trial." United States v. Duarte-
Higareda, 113 F.3d 1000, 1002 (9th Cir. 1997). Here, thecircuit court engaged Torres in a colloquy that essentiallytracked the suggested Duarte-Higareda model. However, theDuarte-Higareda colloquy does not address whether a waiveris voluntary. 
Id. at 288-89, 439 P.3d at 240-41 (footnotes and brackets 
omitted). 
The court continued: "This court's case law clearly 
demonstrates that when a defendant waives a fundamental right, there must be an affirmative, on-the-record showing that the waiver of the right is voluntary. It is thus incumbent on the trial court to have a basis to conclude that a waiver is voluntary." Id. at 289, 439 P.3d at 241. "Unless voluntariness 
is gleaned from the defendant's responses, the trial court must inquire into the voluntariness of the waiver." Id. (citing State 
v. Baker, 132 Hawai# i 1, 7, 319 P.3d 1009, 1015 (2014)). 
"Accordingly, a direct question about voluntariness is required when the defendant's statements in the colloquy do not indicate that the decision to waive a jury trial is the defendant's own free and deliberate choice." Id. at 289-90, 439 P.3d at 241-42. 
"To determine whether the waiver was voluntary, we evaluate 'the totality of the facts and circumstances' of the record in [the] case." Id. at 290, 439 P.3d at 242 (citing Friedman, 93 Hawai# i 
at 68-69, 996 P.2d at 273-74). 
Here, on March 17, 2017, the District Court held a 
status conference at which Najibi submitted a signed "Waiver of Jury Trial" form.

Najibi in the following colloquy: 
THE COURT: All right. Let's start -- let's start with
the waiver of --
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Of course. 
THE COURT: -- jury trial. Please state your name. THE DEFENDANT: My name is Simin Najibi. 
. . . . 
THE COURT: Miss Najibi, is your mind clear
today? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, Your Honor. THE COURT: You understand what a jury. A jury consists
of twelve citizens drawn from the community that must agree
unanimously as to either guilt or -- well, as to guiltbefore you can be convicted. Do you understand that? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, Your Honor. 
THE COURT: All right. Do you also understand that once
you waive your right to a jury trial, you cannot demand a
jury trial? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, Your Honor. 
THE COURT: All right. Very well. The court finds that Simin Najibi has knowingly and
voluntarily waived her right to a jury trial. The court
accepts the waiver of jury trial. 
Under Torres, this record is insufficient to establish 
that Najibi voluntarily waived her right to a jury trial. The 
District Court did not ask Najibi a direct question about whether her waiver was voluntary. Without such a question, Najibi's responses during the on-the-record colloquy "must demonstrate that [her] waiver was [her] own decision without influence of duress or coercion." Torres, 144 Hawai# i at 290, 439 P.3d at 
242. On this record, based on the totality of the circumstances, 
we cannot conclude that Najibi voluntarily waived her right to a jury trial. Thus, the District Court erred in ruling that Najibi's waiver was voluntary. Given our conclusion, we do not reach Najibi's remaining points of error. 
We therefore vacate the Notice of Entry of Judgment 
and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, filed on July 19, 2017, and the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, filed
