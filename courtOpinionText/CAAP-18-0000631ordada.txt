NO. CAAP-18-0000631 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
SHALOM AMAR, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
JONATHAN WRIGHT and ELI WALDON, Defendants-Appellants 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
PUNA DIVISION 
(CIVIL NO. 3RC 17-1-000563) 
ORDER 
(By:  Reifurth, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of Ivan Van Leer's (Van Leer) 
January 7, 2019 Motion to Withdraw as Counsel (Motion), the 
papers in support, the record, and there being no opposition, it 
appears that: 
(1) Van Leer represented Defendants-Appellants Jonathan 
Wright (Wright) and Eli Waldon (Waldon) in the underlying case, 
No. 3RC 17-1-000563; 
(2) On August 15, 2018, Wright and Waldon filed the 
notice of appeal pro se.  The notice of appeal is signed by 
Wright, purportedly for himself and Waldon; 
(3) Under HRS §§ 505-2 and 605-14 (2016), persons not 
licensed to practice law in Hawai# i "are not permitted to act as 
'attorneys' and represent other natural persons in [their] causes."  Oahu Plumbing & Sheet Metal, Ltd. v. Kona Constr., 
Inc., 60 Haw. 372, 377, 590 P.2d 570, 573 (1979); see also HRS § 605-17 (2016) (any person who engages in the unauthorized 
practice of law in violation of HRS § 605-14 "shall be guilty of 
a misdemeanor").  Wright is not an attorney licensed to practice 
law in Hawai# i.  As a party proceeding pro se, Wright is 
authorized to sign and file documents on his behalf but he may 
not sign and file documents for Waldon.  Therefore, the notice of 
appeal is valid as to Wright only, and invalid as to Waldon
; 
(4) On October 26, 2018, the district court clerk filed 
the record on appeal, which identified Van Leer as Wright and 
Waldon's counsel; 
(5) On October 29, 2018, the appellate clerk notified 
the parties, through Van Leer for Wright and Waldon, that the 
statement of jurisdiction and opening brief were due on or before 
November 5, 2018, and December 5, 2018, respectively.  There is 
no indication the appellate clerk notified Wright of the filing 
deadlines; 
(6) Nonetheless, Wright filed pro se the statement of 
jurisdiction on November 2, 2018, and obtained a telephonic 
clerk's extension for the opening brief to January 4, 2019; 
(7) Wright failed to file the opening brief or request 
an extension; 
(8) In the instant Motion, Van Leer seeks to withdraw 
as counsel for Wright and Waldron, because they disregarded his 
advice about whether to appeal, and Wright stated he did not want 
to proceed with the appeal but nonetheless filed the notice of 
appeal pro se without Van Leer's advice, consent, or knowledge. 
Van Leer states Wright and Waldon have not contacted Van Leer 
since Wright filed the notice of appeal.  Van Leer provides 
Wright and Waldon's contact information, consistent with Hawai# i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 50(a); 
2 (9) There appears to be good cause to grant the Motion; 
(10) On January 8, 2018, the appellate clerk entered a 
default of opening brief; and 
(11) Under the circumstances, and given the confusion 
generated by Wright's and Van Leer's filings in this appeal, the 
court will vacate the default notice and establish a new deadline 
for Wright to file the opening brief pro se.1 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed as to Eli Waldon for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
Henceforth, Eli Waldon shall be identified in this appeal as 
Defendant-Appellee. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Motion is granted. 
Henceforth, Jonathan Wright and Eli Waldon shall proceed pro se 
in this appeal, unless counsel enters an appearance for either or 
both of them.  
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the default of opening 
brief, filed January 8, 2019, is vacated.  The deadline to file 
the opening brief is extended to July 1, 2019. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the appellate clerk shall 
mail a copy of this order to Jonathan Wright and Eli Waldon at 
the addresses listed in the notice of appeal and the certificate 
1  It is not clear how several electronic filings in this appeal were 
made.  For instance, the text, format, identifying and contact information,
and signature suggest Wright prepared and signed the statement of jurisdictionand notice of extension of time for the opening brief but the documents wereelectronically filed utilizing Van Leer's Judiciary Electronic Filing System(JEFS) User ID.  It is unclear whether Van Leer filed the documents for Wright, or Wright filed the documents utilizing Van Leer's JEFS User ID. Either would be inappropriate, especially given Van Leer's assertion that he
did not communicate with Wright after Wright filed the notice of appeal. 
Because Wright will henceforth proceed pro se in this appeal, he may not filedocuments utilizing Van Leer's JEFS User ID, and must file documentsconventionally or obtain his own JEFS User ID.  See Hawai #i Electronic Filing 
& Service Rules Rule 4.
