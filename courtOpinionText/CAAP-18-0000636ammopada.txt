IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
MANUEL SANDOVAL, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEALS FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CR. NOS. 1PC141001782, 1PC151001156, AND 1PC161000563) 
AMENDED MEMORANDUM OPINION 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, and Chan and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Manuel Sandoval (Sandoval) was on probation for 
multiple violations of an injunction against harassment 
(Injunction), when he again violated the Injunction by asking the female complaining witness (CW1) to go out with him, shortly before he struck and injured the male complaining witness (CW2). After a bench trial, the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court)
1/ convicted Sandoval of Assault in the Second 
Degree and violation of the Injunction, and sentenced him to a total of six years of incarceration for the two offenses. The Circuit Court also revoked Sandoval's probation for the earlier multiple violations of the Injunction and resentenced him to a total of 11 years of incarceration.  All sentences were to run consecutively to each other and any other sentence he was serving. 
In these consolidated appeals, Sandoval appeals from 
the Circuit Court's July 17, 2018:  (1) Order of Resentencing; Revocation of Probation (Resentencing Order 1) in Criminal No. 1PC141001782 (Case 1); (2) Order of Resentencing; Revocation of 
1/ The Honorable Christine E. Kuriyama presided over all three
underlying cases.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Probation (Resentencing Order 2) in Criminal No. 1PC151001156 
(Case 2); and (3) Judgment of Conviction and Sentence (Judgment) in Criminal No. 1PC161000563 (Case 3).  
Sandoval contends that: (1) his no contest pleas in 
Cases 1 and 2 were not entered in a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent manner; (2) the Circuit Court failed to provide him with required advisements prior to resentencing in Cases 1 and 2; (3) the Circuit Court, in imposing consecutive sentences, failed to address relevant sentencing factors and impermissibly considered Sandoval's refusal to admit guilt as a sentencing factor; and (4) there was insufficient evidence in Case 3 to support a conviction for Assault in the Second Degree. 
For the reasons discussed below, we affirm. 
I. Procedural Background 
The Injunction was filed in the District Court of the 
First Circuit in Civil No. 1SS13-1-1149 on November 14, 2013 and remained in effect for three years.  It restrained Sandoval from, among other things, contacting CW1 or visiting her residence or workplace. 
In Case 1, on May 18, 2015, Sandoval pled no contest to 
nine counts of Violating a Restraining Order or Injunction Against Harassment, in violation of HRS § 604-10.5(i) (Supp. 2013)
2/ (Violating an Injunction) pursuant to a plea agreement. 
The Circuit Court sentenced Sandoval to one year of probation in 
2/ HRS § 604-10.5(i) provides, in relevant part, 
(i)  A knowing or intentional violation of a
restraining order or injunction issued pursuant to this
section is a misdemeanor. The court shall sentence a violator to appropriate counseling and shall sentence aperson convicted under this section as follows: 
(1) For a violation of an injunction or restrainingorder that occurs after a conviction for a violation of the same injunction or restrainingorder, the person shall be sentenced to amandatory minimum jail sentence of not less thanforty-eight hours; and 
(2) For any subsequent violation that occurs after asecond conviction for violation of the same injunction or restraining order, the personshall be sentenced to a mandatory minimum jailsentence of not less than thirty days.

each count, to be served concurrently, and 180 days of jail with 
credit for time served.  The Judgment of Conviction and Sentence was filed that same day, and no appeal was taken.  On May 4, 2016, the State filed a motion to revoke Sandoval's probation in Case 1. 
In Case 2, on March 21, 2016, Sandoval pled no contest 
to two counts of Violating an Injunction.  The Circuit Court sentenced Sandoval to one year of probation and 100 days of jail in each count, running concurrently, with credit for time served. The Judgment of Conviction and Sentence was filed on March 21, 2016, and, again, no appeal was taken.  On February 27, 2017, the State filed a motion to revoke Sandoval's probation in Case 2.  
In Case 3, after a jury waived bench trial, Sandoval 
was found guilty of one count of Assault in the Second Degree, in violation of HRS § 707-711(1)(a), (1)(b) and/or (1)(d),
3/ and one 
3/ The Circuit Court concluded, in its May 21, 2018 Findings of Fact,
Conclusions of Law and Order, that Sandoval violated HRS § 707-711(1)(a),
(1)(b) and/or (1)(d).  However, the Judgment, filed on July 17, 2018, refersonly to HRS § 707-711(1)(a). 
When Sandoval was charged in 2016, HRS § 707-711(1) (2014)
provided, in relevant parts: 
(1) A person commits the offense of assault in the
second degree if: 
(a) The person intentionally or knowingly causessubstantial bodily injury to another; 
(b) The person recklessly causes serious orsubstantial bodily injury to another; 
. . . . 
(d) The person intentionally or knowingly causes
bodily injury to another with a dangerousinstrument[.] 
HRS § 707-711(1) was later amended, effective July 1, 2016.  The 
current version provides, in relevant parts: 
(1)  A person commits the offense of assault in the seconddegree if: 
(a) The person intentionally, knowingly, or
recklessly causes substantial bodily injury toanother; 
(b) The person recklessly causes serious bodily
injury to another; 
(continued...)

count of Violating an Injunction. 
On July 17, 2018, the Circuit Court held a sentencing 
hearing in Case 3, and also heard the State's motions to revoke 
Sandoval's probation in Cases 1 and 2. Sandoval stipulated to the motions to revoke probation.  The Circuit Court:  (1) sentenced Sandoval to five years of incarceration for Assault in the Second Degree and one year of incarceration for Violating an Injunction in Case 3; (2) resentenced Sandoval to one year of incarceration in each of the nine counts of Violating an Injunction in Case 1; and (3) resentenced Sandoval to one year of incarceration in each of the two counts of Violating an Injunction in Case 2.  The Circuit Court ordered that all sentences in the three cases be served consecutively to each other and any sentence Sandoval was then serving, with credit given for time served. 
On August 16, 2018, Sandoval filed separate Notices of 
Appeal from: (1) the Judgment in Case 3 (CAAP-18-0000636); (2) Resentencing Order 1 in Case 1 (CAAP-18-0000638); and (3) Resentencing Order 2 in Case 2 (CAAP-18-0000637). 
On November 5, 2018, this Court consolidated the three 
appeals under appellate case number CAAP-18-0000636. 
II. Discussion 
A. No Contest Pleas in Cases 1 and 2 
In his first point of error, Sandoval asserts that his 
no contest pleas in Cases 1 and 2 were not entered in a 
voluntary, knowing, and intelligent manner.  But Sandoval did not appeal from the underlying judgments in Cases 1 and 2.  Rather, he appealed from a post-judgment order in each case — Resentencing Order 1 and Resentencing Order 2 (collectively, Resentencing Orders or Orders).  
"A post-judgment order is appealable in its own right 
3/(...continued)
. . . . 
(d) The person intentionally or knowingly causes
bodily injury to another with a dangerous
instrument[.]     
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
only if it meets the test of finality applicable to all judicial 
decisions."  State v. Johnson, 96 Hawai# i 462, 469, 32 P.3d 106, 
113 (App. 2001) (quoting Powers v. Ellis, 55 Haw. 414, 416, 520 P.2d 431, 433 (1974)) (internal quotation marks omitted).  A final order is one that ends the proceedings while leaving nothing further to be accomplished.  Id.
We have noted that a 
criminal defendant may "appeal from [an] order that disposes of [a] motion for revocation of probation."  Id. at 471, 32 P.3d at 115. 
Because the Resentencing Orders ended the respective 
post-judgment probation revocation proceedings in Cases 1 and 2 and aggrieved Sandoval by sentencing him to imprisonment, and the Notices of Appeal from the Orders were timely filed, we have jurisdiction over the Orders.  HRS § 641-11 (2016).
4/  But in 
reviewing post-judgment orders such as these, "this court will only consider other orders [that] were preliminary rulings upon which the subject Order was predicated or were part of the series of orders which collectively led to that Order."  Cook v. Surety Life Ins. Co., 79 Hawai# i 403, 409, 903 P.2d 708, 714 (App. 1995) 
(citing Weinberg v. Mauch
, 78 Hawai# i 40, 46, 890 P.2d 277, 283 
(1995)).  Sandoval's no contest pleas in Cases 1 and 2 led to the judgments, not the post-judgment Resentencing Orders, in those cases.  Because Sandoval failed to timely appeal from the judgments in Cases 1 and 2, we lack jurisdiction to consider the merits of his first point of error.
B. Advisements Prior to Resentencing 
In his second point of error, Sandoval contends that 
the Circuit Court, in accepting his stipulation to the motions to 
revoke probation, failed to advise him of the maximum penalty provided by law and the impact consecutive sentences would have on any potential length of incarceration.  Sandoval has waived 
4/ HRS § 641-11 provides: 
From Circuit Courts. Any party aggrieved by the
judgment of a circuit court in a criminal matter may appeal
to the intermediate appellate court, subject to chapter 602,in the manner and within the time provided by the rules ofcourt. The sentence of the court in a criminal case shall be the judgment. All appeals shall be filed with the clerk ofthe supreme court and shall be subject to one filing fee. 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
this point of error by failing to present a supporting argument. 
See HRAP Rule 28(b)(7) ("Points not argued may be deemed waived.").  Regardless, Sandoval cites no authority for the proposition that a defendant must be so advised when he stipulates to a motion to revoke probation, and we have found none.
5/  Cf. HRS § 706-625(5) (2014) ("When the court revokes 
probation, it may impose on the defendant any sentence that might have been imposed originally for the crime of which the defendant was convicted.")  Sandoval's second pont of error therefore fails. 
C. Sentencing Factors 
In his third point of error, Sandoval argues that the 
Circuit Court, in imposing consecutive sentences, failed to 
adequately address relevant statutory sentencing factors, failed to explain its rationale for each consecutive sentence, and improperly relied on Sandoval's refusal to admit guilt as a factor in sentencing.  We disagree. 
A sentencing judge "generally has broad discretion in 
imposing a sentence."  State v. Mundon, 121 Hawai# i 339, 349, 219 
P.3d 1126, 1136 (2009) (quoting State v. Kahapea, 111 Hawai# i 
267, 278, 141 P.3d 440, 451 (2006)). 
The applicable standard of review for sentencing or
resentencing matters is whether the court committed plainand manifest abuse of discretion in its decision. Factors which indicate a plain and manifest abuse of discretion arearbitrary or capricious action by the judge and a rigidrefusal to consider the defendant's contentions. And,generally, to constitute an abuse it must appear that thecourt clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregardedrules or principles of law or practice to the substantialdetriment of a party litigant. 
5/ Moreover, the record reveals that when Sandoval stipulated to the
motions to revoke probation, he had notice that consecutive sentences could beimposed.  For example, in Cases 1 and 2: (1) Sandoval signed a No Contest Pleaform acknowledging that the court could impose consecutive terms ofimprisonment; (2) Sandoval's attorney certified that she fully explained theno contest plea form to Sandoval, believed he understood the document in itsentirety, and believed his plea was "made voluntarily and with an intelligentunderstanding of the nature of the charge(s) and possible consequences"; and(3) Sandoval signed and acknowledged that he understood the Terms andConditions of Probation, which stated that the court could revoke hisprobation and resentence him upon a violation of the terms and conditions ofhis probation.  Cf. State v. Takemoto, CAAP-15-0000522 & CAAP-15-0000523, 2016WL 6997662, at **4 (Haw. Ct. App. Nov. 30, 2016) (Mem.) (ruling that thedefendant, who had signed similar forms, had received notice that he could besubject to consecutive sentences).  The transcripts of Sandoval’s change ofplea hearings in Cases 1 and 2 also indicate that Sandoval understood theconcept of consecutive sentences.

Mundon, 121 Hawai# i at 349, 219 P.3d at 1136 (quoting Kahapea, 
111 
Hawai# i at 278, 141 P.3d at 451).  
A sentencing judge also has discretion to order 
multiple terms of imprisonment to run concurrently or 
consecutively.  HRS § 706-668.5(1) (2014 & Supp. 2018).6/  In 
making that determination, the court must consider the following factors: 
(1) The nature and circumstances of the offense and the 
history and characteristics of the defendant; 
(2) The need for the sentence imposed: 
(a) To reflect the seriousness of the offense, to
promote respect for law, and to provide justpunishment for the offense; 
(b) To afford adequate deterrence to criminalconduct; 
(c) To protect the public from further crimes of thedefendant; and 
(d) To provide the defendant with needed educationalor vocational training, medical care, or othercorrectional treatment in the most effective manner; 
(3) The kinds of sentences available; and 
(4) The need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparitiesamong defendants with similar records who have beenfound guilty of similar conduct. 
HRS § 706-606 (2014).  "The weight to be given the[se] factors 
. . . in imposing sentence is a matter generally left to the discretion of the sentencing court, taking into consideration the circumstances of each case."  State v. Kong, 131 Hawai# i 94, 101, 
315 P.3d 720, 727 (2013) (quoting State v. Akana, 10 Haw. App. 381, 386, 876 P.2d 1331, 1334 (1994)).  
Although a sentencing court must state its reasons for 
6/ HRS § 706-668.5 provides in relevant parts: 
(1) If multiple terms of imprisonment are imposed on a
defendant, whether at the same time or at different times,
or if a term of imprisonment is imposed on a defendant whois already subject to an unexpired term of imprisonment, theterms may run concurrently or consecutively. Multiple termsof imprisonment run concurrently unless the court orders orthe statute mandates that the terms run consecutively. 
(2) The court, in determining whether the terms
imposed are to be ordered to run concurrently orconsecutively, shall consider the factors set forth insection 706-606. 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
imposing a consecutive rather than a concurrent sentence, State 
v. Hussein, 122 Hawai# i 495, 509-10, 229 P.3d 313, 327-28 (2010), 
absent clear evidence to the contrary, we must assume that the sentencing court considered all of the HRS § 706-606 factors prior to imposing concurrent or consecutive terms, State v. Vellina, 106 Hawai# i 441, 449, 106 P.3d 364, 372 (2005) (quoting 
State v. Tauiliili, 96 Hawai# i 195, 199-200, 29 P.3d 914, 918-19 
(2001)).  The sentencing court is required to articulate its reasoning only with respect to the factors it relies on.  State v. Smith, 106 Hawai# i 365, 379, 105 P.3d 242, 256 (App. 2004); 
see Kong, 131 Hawai# i at 102, 315 P.3d at 728. 
Here, the record makes clear that the Circuit Court 
carefully considered the relevant HRS § 706-606 factors.  After considering the State's detailed assessment of each factor, the Circuit Court explicitly stated that it had "looked at the sentencing factors set forth in Section 706-606 of the 
Hawai'i 
Revised Statutes and the factors to be considered in imposing a term of probation under Section 706-621. [The State] discussed each of these factors and I agree with [its] assessment." (Emphasis added).  The Circuit Court also identified several concerns that related to the sentencing factors, including that Sandoval had repeatedly failed to comply with the terms of his probation (HRS § 706-606(2)(a)-(d)); showed escalating behavior (HRS § 706-606(1) and (2)(c)); made statements suggesting he would continue violating the Injunction (HRS § 706-606(1) and (2)(a)-(d)); and lacked insight into personal issues, blamed others for his circumstances, and posed a danger to others (HRS § 706-606(1) and (2)(c)).  Indeed, the Circuit Court stated, "I am concerned about the Assault 2 incident.  I'm very concerned about the TRO
7/ violations.  And I'm very concerned about [CW1's] 
safety and well being."  (Emphasis added.)  The court concluded 
that a sentence of probation was not a viable option and that, 
for the reasons stated, the sentences in all three cases were to run consecutively (HRS § 706-606(3)). 
The Circuit Court's reasoning also satisfied the 
7/ The Circuit Court appears to have referred to the Injunction as a 
"TRO." 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
requirements of Hussein for imposing consecutive sentences. 
First, the Circuit Court's statements regarding, among other things, Sandoval's repeated violations of the Injunction, his escalating conduct, and his danger to others, identified the specific facts or circumstances within the range of statutory factors that the court considered.  Hussein, 122 
Hawai# i at 509, 
229 P.3d at 327.  Second, the Circuit Court's statements that it was imposing consecutive sentences based on "the totality of the[se] circumstances" demonstrated for Sandoval, the public, and this court that the decision to impose consecutive sentences was deliberate, rational, and fair.
8/  Id.  Accordingly, the Circuit 
Court did not abuse its discretion in imposing, and stating its reasons for, consecutive sentences. 
Sandoval contends that the Circuit Court's comments 
during sentencing suggest that it improperly relied on his refusal to admit guilt as a factor in imposing his sentences. Despite devoting seven full pages of his Opening Brief to extended quotations from the July 17, 2018 sentencing hearing, Sandoval does not indicate specifically where in the record the alleged error occurred and what parts of the record support his argument.  Thus, his Opening Brief does not comply with HRAP Rule 28(b)(4)
9/ and (7), and his argument fails on this ground alone. 
8/ Sandoval also argues that the Circuit Court "should have explained
its rationale for each consecutive sentence in order to inform the defendant 
and appellate courts of the specific factors underlying each sentence." Neither Hussein nor Kong imposes such a requirement on the sentencing court. 
9/ HRAP Rule 28(b) provides, in relevant parts: 
(b)  Opening brief . Within 40 days after the filing of
the record on appeal, the appellant shall file an openingbrief, containing the following sections in the order hereindicated: 
. . . . 
(4)  A concise statement of the points of error
set forth in separately numbered paragraphs. Eachpoint shall state: (i) the alleged error committed bythe court or agency; (ii) where in the record thealleged error occurred; and (iii) where in the recordthe alleged error was objected to or the manner inwhich the alleged error was brought to the attentionof the court or agency. Where applicable, each pointshall also include the following: 
(continued...) 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Nevertheless, we have reviewed the sentencing hearing 
transcript and the relevant authorities and can find no support 
for Sandoval's argument.  In State v. Kamana# o, 103 Hawai# i 315, 
82 P.3d 401 (2003), the Hawai
#i Supreme Court adopted the 
following three-part test for determining whether a sentencing court has relied on a defendant's refusal to admit guilt in imposing a sentence: "(1) the defendant's maintenance of innocence after conviction, (2) the judge's attempt to get the defendant to admit guilt, and (3) the appearance that, had the defendant affirmatively admitted guilt, his sentence would not have been so severe[.]"  Id. at 323, 82 P.3d at 409 (original brackets omitted) (quoting People v. Wesley, 411 N.W.2d 159, 162 (Mich. 1987)).  
As discussed above, during sentencing, the Circuit 
Court expressed concerns about Sandoval's repeated violations of the terms of his probation, the indications he would continue violating the Injunction, his escalating behavior, his lack of insight into personal issues, and his danger to others.  The record simply does not support Sandoval's conclusion that the Circuit Court attempted to get him to admit guilt or that, if he had admitted guilt, his sentence "would not have been so severe."

(B) when the point involves a jury

103 Hawai# i at 323, 82 P.3d at 409.  Under these circumstances, 
we find no error by the Circuit Court.
D. Sufficiency of the Evidence 
In his fourth point of error, Sandoval contends that 
there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for 
Assault in the Second Degree, because he did not use a weapon to injure CW2 and because he acted in self-defense.  Again, we disagree. 
When reviewing the sufficiency of evidence on appeal, 
we apply the following deferential standard of review:  
[
E]vidence adduced in the trial court must be considered in
the strongest light for the prosecution when the appellate
court passes on the legal sufficiency of such evidence tosupport a conviction; the same standard applies whether thecase was before a judge or a jury. The test on appeal is notwhether guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt, but
whether there was substantial evidence to support the
conclusion of the trier of fact. 
State v. Kalaola, 124 Hawai i # 43, 49, 237 P.3d 1109, 1115 (2010) 
(brackets in original) (quoting State v. Richie, 88 Hawai# i 19, 
33, 960 P.2d 1227, 1241 (1998)).  "'Substantial evidence' . . . 
is credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion."  Kalaola, 124 Hawai# i at 49, 237 P.3d at 1115 
(quoting Richie, 88 Hawai i #at 33, 960 P.2d at 1241). 
Sandoval was convicted of violating HRS § 707-
711(1)(a), which at the time he was charged (see supra note 4), proscribed intentionally or knowingly "caus[ing] substantial bodily injury to another[.]"  HRS § 707-711(1)(a) (2014). Substantial bodily injury was (and still is) defined, in relevant part, as "bodily injury which causes . . . [a] major avulsion, laceration, or penetration of the skin[.]"  Id. 
The State produced sufficient evidence to support 
Sandoval's conviction under HRS § 707-711(1)(a).  CW2 and two additional witnesses testified that on the night of the incident, Sandoval approached CW2 and struck him in the face.  One of the additional witnesses testified that he also "clearly saw" Sandoval use a knife to cut CW2 across his left cheek, and another witness testified that he observed Sandoval holding a knife during the incident.  Sandoval denied using a knife to hit 
11 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
CW2, but admitted wearing a ring with studs in the shape of a 
horse. 
The evidence further shows that CW2 sustained 
substantial bodily injuries during the incident, including one laceration on his left cheek and another on the right side of his face above his upper lip, both of which required multiple stitches. 
We will not disturb the Circuit Court's finding that 
the State's witnesses were credible and their testimony was credible and reliable.  See State v. Mattiello, 90 
Hawai# i 255, 
259, 978 P.2d 693, 697 (1999) (quoting State v. Stoker, 90 Hawai# i 85, 90, 976 P.2d 399, 404 (1999)).  Considering the 
evidence in the strongest light for the prosecution, we conclude there was sufficient evidence to negate Sandoval's claim of self-defense and to support his conviction for assault in the second degree.

Conclusion 
We affirm the Resentencing Orders in Cases 1 and 2 and
