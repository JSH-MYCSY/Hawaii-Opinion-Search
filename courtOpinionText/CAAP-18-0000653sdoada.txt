VICTORINO PHILLING, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(HONOLULU DIVISION)
(CASE NO. 1DTA-17-01938)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Victorino Philling ( Philling)
appeals from the July 30, 2018 Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or
Order and Plea/Judgment ( Judgment) entered in the Honolulu
Division of the District Court of the First Circuit (District
Court).  Following a bench trial, Philling was convicted on two
counts:  (1) Operating a vehicle after license and privilege have
been suspended or revoked for operating a vehicle under the
influence of an intoxicant; penalties ( OVUII with prior1

revocation ), in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) §
291E-61(a)(1) and/or (a)(2) (2007 and Supp. 2018);  and (2)
Consuming or Possessing Intoxicating Liquor While Operating Motor
Vehicle or Moped (Open Container ), in violation of HRS § 291-
3.1(b) (2007).32
Philling raises two points of error on appeal,
contending that:  (1) his constitutional right to testify was
violated when the District Court failed to administer a complete
2HRS § 291E-62 provides, in relevant part:
§ 291E-62  Operating a vehicle after license and
privilege have been suspended or revoked for operating a
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant; penalties.  
(a) No person whose license and privilege to operate a
vehicle have been revoked, suspended, or otherwise
restricted pursuant to this section or to part III or
section 291E-61 or 291E-61.5, or to part VII or part XIV or
chapter 286 or section 200-81, 291-4, 291-4.4, 291-4.5, or
291-7 as those provisions were in effect on December 31,
2001 shall operate or assume actual physical control of any
vehicle:
(1)In violation of any restriction placed on the
person's license; or
(2)While the person's license or privilege to
operate a vehicle remains suspended or revoked.
. . . .
(c)Any person convicted of violating this section shall
be sentenced as follows without possibility of probation or
suspension of sentence:
(3)For an offense that occurs within five years of two or
more prior convictions for offenses under this
section, section 291E-66, or section 291-4.5 as that
section was in effect on December 31, 2001, or any
combination thereof;
(A)One year imprisonment;
(B)A $2,000 fine;
(C)Permanent revocation of the person's license and
privilege to operate a vehicle; and
(D)Loss of the privilege to operate a vehicle equipped
with an ignition interlock device, if applicable.
3HRS § 291-3.1(b) provides:
§ 291-3.1  Consuming or possessing intoxicating liquor
while operating motor vehicle or moped.  . . .
(b)  No person shall possess, while operating a motor
vehicle or moped upon any public street, road, or highway,
any bottle, can, or other receptacle containing any
intoxicating liquor which has been opened, or a seal broken,
or the contents of which have been partially removed.

ultimate colloquy; and (2)  the District Court erred in admitting
Philling's Traffic Abstract (Abstract ) and two prior Notice of
Administrative Review Decisions ( ADLRO Decisions)  into evidence.4
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve Philling's contentions as follows:
 (1)  "It is well settled in Hawai #i law that a
defendant relinquishes fundamental rights only when a waiver is
undertaken intelligently, knowingly, and voluntarily." State v.
Wilson, 144 Hawai# i 454, 463, 445 P.3d. 35, 44 (2019) (citation
omitted).  "Before accepting the waiver of a fundamental right, a
trial court must engage in an on-the-record colloquy with the
defendant."  Id.
Hawai#i law has historically protected both the right
to testify and the right not to testify. The right to
testify is guaranteed by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to
the United States Constitution; the Hawai #i Constitution's
parallel guarantees under article I, sections 5, 10, and 14;
and HRS § 801-2. The right not to testify is guaranteed by
the United States Constitution's Fifth Amendment guarantee
against compelled testimony and the Hawai #i Constitution's
parallel guarantee under article I, section 10.
State v. Celestine, 142 Hawai #i 165, 169, 415 P.3d 907, 911
(2018) (citations omitted).  In Tachibana v. State, the Hawai#i
Supreme Court established requirements that trial courts advise
criminal defendants specifically of the right to testify and
obtain an on-the-record waiver of that right.  79 Hawai#i 226,
236, 900 P.2d 1293, 1303 (1995).

Office.
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
There are two components of the Tachibana requirement. 
The first is that the trial court inform the defendant as to five
fundamental principles pertaining to his right to testify and
right not to testify:
[(1)] that he or she has a right to testify, [(2)]  that if
he or she wants to testify that no one can prevent him or
her from doing so, and [(3)] that if he or she testifies the
prosecution will be allowed to cross-examine him or her.  In
connection with the privilege against self-incrimination,
the defendant should also be advised [(4)] that he or she
has a right not to testify and [(5)] that if he or she does
not testify then the jury can be instructed about that
right.
Celestine, 142 Hawai #i at 170, 415 P.3d at 912 (citing Tachibana,
79 Hawai# i
 at 236 n.7, 900 P.2d at 1303 n.7) (original brackets
omitted).
The second component involves the court engaging in a
true "colloquy" with the defendant, which "consists of a verbal
exchange between the judge and the defendant 'in which the judge
ascertains the defendant's understanding of the proceedings and
of the defendant's rights.'"  Celestine, 142 Hawai #i at 170, 415
P.3d at 912 (emphasis omitted) (quoting State v. Han, 130 Hawai
#i
83, 90, 306 P.3d 128, 135 (2013)).  
The trial court must "elicit[] responses as to whether
the defendant intends to not testify, whether anyone is forcing
the defendant not to testify, and whether the decision to not
testify is the defendant's."  Celestine, 142 Hawai #i at 170-71,
415 P.3d at 912-13 (citation omitted).  The supreme court has
instructed that a trial court should engage in a verbal exchange
with the defendant at least twice:  (1) once "after the court
informs the defendant of the right to testify and of the right
not to testify and the protections associated with these rights"; 
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
and, (2) once again "after the court indicates to the defendant
its understanding that the defendant does not intend to testify." 
Id. at 170, 415 P.3d at 912 (citation omitted).
Here, Philling argues that the District Court failed to
properly conduct the second and ultimate colloquy because the
District Court failed to inform him that he has a right to
testify and that if he wants to testify, no one can prevent him
from doing so.  Philling submits that the court's failure to
ensure his understanding was particularly harmful because of
Philling's reliance on an interpreter.  The State acknowledges
evidence in the record that English is clearly not Philling's
first language, and that he was educated in Guam, not the United
States.
The State concedes, and the trial transcript confirms,
that although the District Court used the phrase "if you elect to
testify" in various queries, the court did not inform Philling
that he had a right to testify, as is required.  The District
Court asked Philling:  "Although you should confer with your
attorney whether to testify or not, you understand that the final
decision is entirely up to you?"  However, the court did not
specifically inform Philling that if he wanted to testify, no one
could prevent him from doing so.  
Particularly in light of the potential language barrier
here, and the lack of any additional questions to verify that
Philling understood the right that he was waiving, we cannot
conclude that the District Court properly established Philling's
understanding of his right to testify.  Therefore, the record
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
does not demonstrate that Philling's waiver of his right to
testify was knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made.  Han,
130 Hawai #i at 91, 306 P.3d at 136 ("The failure to ensure that
[the defendant] understood his rights amounts to a failure to
obtain the on-the-record waiver required by Tachibana.").
When the violation of a constitutional right has been
established, "the conviction must be vacated unless the State can
prove that the violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt." 
Tachibana, 79 Hawai #i at 240, 900 P.2d at 1307.  Under the
harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standard, the court must
determine "whether there is a reasonable possibility that error
might have contributed to [the] conviction."  State v.
Eduwensuyi, 141 Hawai#i 328, 336, 409 P.3d 732, 740 (2018).  If
such reasonable possibility exists, then "the judgment of
conviction on which it may have been based must be set aside."
State v. Pulse, 83 Hawai#i 229, 248, 925 P.2d 797, 816 (1996).
When assessing whether the error was harmless, "[a] crucial if
not determinative consideration . . . is the strength of the
prosecution’s case on the defendant’s guilt."  State v. Tetu, 139
Hawai#i 207, 226, 386 P.3d 844, 863 (2016) (quoting State v.
Fukusaku, 85 Hawai# i 462, 482-83, 946 P.2d 32, 52-53 (1997)).
Here, the State does not argue that the faulty colloquy
was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  Moreover, the record
does not contain any indication as to what Philling would have
said if he had testified.  This case was tried without any
physical or scientific evidence, and the State made its case
solely through the testimony of two police officers; the defense
6NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
attempted, through cross-examination and argument, to show that
there was reasonable doubt.  On the record in this case, we
cannot conclude that the District Court's error was harmless
beyond a reasonable doubt because we are unable to determine
whether Philling's testimony, had he given it, could have shed
light on whether Philling operated a vehicle under the influence
of alcohol in an amount sufficient to impair his normal mental
faculties or ability to care for the person and guard against
casualty or on who possessed the open beer bottle and/or what was
in the bottle.  See, e.g., Eduwensuyi, 141 Hawai #i at 336-37, 409
P.3d at 740-41.
(2) Philling argues that the Abstract was not relevant
because the State failed to establish that the person named in
the Abstract was Philling and it was not properly authenticated. 
This argument is without merit.  The Abstract introduced at trial
included, inter alia , Philling's name, date of birth, and social
security number, which were also testified to by the State's
witnesses; thus, the State did establish that the person named in
the Abstract was Philling.  The State's exhibit was certified by
and bears the signature of the Clerk of the District Court.  We
conclude that the Abstract was self-authenticating under Hawai #i
Rules of Evidence ( HRE) Rule 902.  See State v. Davis, 133
Hawai#i 102, 120, 324 P.3d 912, 930 (2014).
Philling further argues that the ADLRO Decisions should
not have been admitted into evidence in lieu of the testimony of
their authors to establish that Philling's license was revoked
when he was cited for OVUII.  As a preliminary matter, we note
7NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
that the ADLRO is a component of the Hawai #i Judiciary, acting
under the authority of the Administrative Director of the Courts
and in accordance with HRS Chapter 291E.  The ADLRO Decisions are
the types of record the ADLRO is required to create and maintain. 
They were certified, sealed, and signed by the Acting Custodian
of Records of the ADLRO ( Custodian of Records ).
Citing Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 557 U.S. 305
(2009), and State v. Fields, 115 Hawai #i 503, 168 P.3d 955
(2007), Philling argues that the certification of the Custodian
of Records was in lieu of testimony and violated his right to
confrontation pursuant to the Sixth Amendment of the United
States Constitution and article I, section 14 of the Hawai# i
Constitution.  
With respect to business or public records, this issue
was clarified in State v. Fitzwater, 122 Hawai #i 354, 370, 227
P.3d 520, 536 (2010), wherein the defendant argued that even if a
speed check card were admissible as a business record under HRE
Rule 803(b)(6), the prosecution's use of the card in lieu of the
testimony of the person whose statements were reflected on the
card violated the defendant's right to confrontation.  The
supreme court rejected this argument, explaining:
The confrontation clause provides in pertinent part
that "in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy
the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him,"
U.S. Const. amend. VI, and this guarantee applies to both
federal and state prosecutions, Crawford [v. Washington],
541 U.S. [36,] 42 [(2004)].  In Crawford, the United States
Supreme Court held that the confrontation clause bars
"admission of testimonial statements of a witness who did
not appear at trial unless he was unavailable to testify,
and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for
cross-examination."  Although the Court in Crawford left
open the possibility that the confrontation clause would
apply to nontestimonial hearsay, the Court in Davis v.
Washington, 547 U.S. 813, 821 (2006), subsequently held that
8NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
"it is the testimonial character of the statement that
separates it from other hearsay that, while subject to
traditional limitations upon hearsay evidence, is not
subject to the Confrontation Clause."  Id. at 821.  
Therefore, in order to determine whether the author of a
speed check card is subject to confrontation under the Sixth
Amendment, we must determine whether the card is
"testimonial."
Id. at 371, at 227 P.3d at 537 (footnotes, brackets, ellipsis,
and parallel citations omitted).
The supreme court reviewed applicable case law and
analyzed what is "testimonial" in nature, observing that the
Confrontation Clause applies to "those who bear testimony," that
testimony is generally a "solemn declaration or affirmation made
for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact," and that
"documents prepared in the regular course . . . may well qualify
as nontestimonial records."  Id. at 371-74, 227 P.3d at 537-40. 
(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  The supreme
court concluded that the speed check card at issue was created in
a non-adversarial setting in the regular course of maintaining a
police vehicle record, well in advance of the alleged speeding
incident at issue in Fitzwater and, thus, Fitzwater's right to
confrontation was not violated by the admission of the speed
check evidence.  Id. at 374, 227 P.3d at 540; cf. State v.
Souleng, 134 Hawai #i 465, 472-73, 342 P.3d 884, 891-92 (App.
2015) (concluding that a letter certifying that the defendant did
not have a valid driver's license as of the pertinent date, which
was prepared specifically for use at trial, i.e., to provide
evidence against the defendant, was testimonial and implicated
the defendant's Sixth Amendment confrontation rights).
9NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Here, the ADLRO Decisions are official records of the
outcome of prior ADLRO proceedings and were not prepared
specifically for use at Philling's trial in this case.  Although
the underlying proceedings were confrontational in nature, the
certified copies of the ADLRO Decisions were offered to prove the
fact of the prior revocations, but were not offered to prove the
facts supporting the ADLRO Decisions.  See State v. Samonte, 83
Hawai#i 507, 534-38, 928 P.2d 1, 28-32 (1996) (holding that "a
judgment of conviction in Hawai#i qualifies as a record of a
public office or agency setting forth matters observed pursuant
to a duty imposed by law as to which matters there was a duty to
report" that is admissible pursuant to HRE Rule 803(b)(8)(B)). 
Accordingly, we conclude that Philling's right to
confrontation was not implicated and the District Court did not
err in admitting these records into evidence.
Nevertheless, based on the District Court's failure to
obtain a proper on-the-record waiver of Philling's right to
testify, as required by Tachibana, the District Court's July 30,
2018 Judgment is vacated, and this case is remanded to the
District Court for further proceedings.
