APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
AND 
DISMISSING ALL PENDING MOTIONS AS MOOT 
(By: Ginoza, C.J., Fujise and Chan, JJ.) 
Upon review of (1) Lienor-Appellee Nordic Construction, 
Ltd.'s (Nordic Construction) November 7, 2018 motion to dismiss 
appellate court case number CAAP-18-0000659 for lack of appellate 
jurisdiction, (2) Respondent-Appellant Maui Beach Resort Limited 
Partnership's (Maui Beach Resort) November 15, 2018 memorandum in 
opposition to Nordic Construction's November 7, 2018 motion, and NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(3) the record, it appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction 
over Maui Beach Resort's appeal from the Honorable Rhonda I.L. 
Loo's 
• February 26, 2018 post-judgment order granting
Nordic Construction's motion for relief from a prior May 16, 2011 post-judgment order dischargingand releasing Maui Beach Resort's security bondpursuant to Rule 60(b) of the Hawai# i Rules of 
Civil Procedure (HRCP), and 
• July 23, 2018 post-judgment order denying MauiBeach Resorts' motion for leave to file an interlocutory appeal pursuant to Hawaii RevisedStatutes (HRS) § 641-1(b) (2016) 
Maui Beach Resort's appeal is untimely under Rule 4(a)(1) of the 
Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) as to the 
February 26, 2018 post-judgment order, and, furthermore, the July 23, 2018 post-judgment order is not an appealable order 
under HRS § 641-1(b). 
A summary of the procedural history provides the 
context for the two appealed post-judgment orders. In a prior 
appeal in appellate court case number 30151 from the same 
underlying circuit court case in M.L. No. 08-1-0017(1), the 
Supreme Court of Hawai# i ruled, among other things, that Nordic 
Construction's "August 8, 2008 application for [a mechanic's and materialman's] lien filed as M.L. No. 08-1-0017 was finally 
determined by the December 30, 2008 order dismissing the 
application[,]" and, thus, any subsequent proceeding "was a post-
judgment proceeding in M.L. No. 08-1-0017." 
Nordic Construction 
Co., Ltd. v. Maui Beach Resort Ltd. Partnership, No. 30151, 2010 WL 1434304 at *2 (Hawai# i Apr. 8, 2010).
  1
1 All of the Nordic Construction Co., Ltd. court's rulings in
appellate court case number 30151, including its treatment of the December 30,
2008 dismissal order as a judgment, are the law of the case for M.L. No. 08-1-0017 that, therefore, "may not be disputed by a reopening of the question at alater stage of the litigation." Hussey v. Say, 139 Hawai #i, 181, 185, 384
P.3d 1282, 1286 (2016) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
After the conclusion of that appeal, as well as the 
subsequent entry of an arbitration decision in favor of Maui 
Beach Resort's interests in a separate but related proceeding, 
Maui Beach Resort renewed its post-judgment motion to discharge 
and release its security bond in M.L. 08-1-0017, which the 
circuit court granted by way of a May 16, 2011 post-judgment 
discharge order. On November 14, 2017, Nordic Construction filed 
an HRCP Rule 60(b) post-judgment motion for relief from the 
May 16, 2011 discharge order in M.L. 08-1-0017. On February 26, 
2018, the circuit court granted Nordic Construction's post-
judgment motion and vacated the May 16, 2011 post-judgment 
discharge order pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b). 
A post-judgment order is an appealable final post-
judgment order under HRS § 641-1(a) if it ends the post-judgment 
proceeding, leaving nothing further to be accomplished. Ditto, 
103 Hawai# i at 157-59, 80 P.3d at 978-80. The February 26, 2018 
post-judgment order appears to have finally determined, and, thus, ended the post-judgment proceeding for Nordic 
Construction's HRCP Rule 60(b) motion for relief from the May 16, 
2011 post-judgment discharge order by having disposed of all the 
issues that Nordic Construction raised in its Rule 60(6) motion, 
leaving nothing further to be accomplished in that particular 
post-judgment proceeding. Therefore, the February 26, 2018 post-
judgment order is an appealable final post-judgment order under 
HRS § 641-1(a). 
Nevertheless, Maui Beach Resort did not file its 
August 21, 2018 notice of appeal within thirty days after entry 
of the February 26, 2018 post-judgment order, as HRAP 
Rule 4(a)(1) required for a timely appeal. Therefore, we lack 
appellate jurisdiction to review the February 26, 2018 post-
judgment order. Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 
1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b). 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Although Maui Beach Resort filed its August 21, 2018 
notice of appeal within thirty days after entry of the July 23, 
2018 post-judgment order denying Maui Beach Resorts' motion for 
leave to file an interlocutory appeal, HRS § 641-1(b) expressly 
provides that "[t]he refusal of the circuit court to allow an 
appeal from an interlocutory judgment, order, or decree shall not 
be reviewable by any other court." HRS § 641-1(b). See, e.g., 
State v. Nilsawit, 139 Hawai# i 86, 93, 384 P.3d 862, 869 (2016) 
(Explaining that when a circuit court denies a motion for leave to appeal pursuant to HRS § 641-1(b), "the reason for the ICA's 
lack of jurisdiction over the Order Denying Leave to Appeal 
is . . . simply because such an order is not appealable."). The 
July 23, 2018 post-judgment order is not appealable under HRS 
§ 641-1(b). 
Nevertheless, Maui Beach Resort argues that the 
July 23, 2018 post-judgment order should qualify as an 
independently appealable final post-judgment order that was 
necessary for the resolution of Nordic Construction's 
November 14, 2017 HRCP Rule 60(b) post-judgment motion, because 
the circuit court included an additional explanation in the 
July 23, 2018 post-judgment order about how any subsequent issues 
regarding the posting of any security bond should be addressed in 
a separate but related proceeding that is ongoing in Civil No. 
18-1-0689-05 (BIA). 
Nevertheless, that additional explanation 
was superfluous for the purpose of adjudicating Maui Beach Resorts' motion for leave to file an interlocutory appeal 
pursuant to HRS § 641-1(b). Furthermore, the February 26, 2018 
post-judgment order was, by itself, sufficiently final without 
the additional explanation in the July 23, 2018 post-judgment 
order, and, as already stated, Maui Beach Resort's appeal from 
the February 26, 2018 post-judgment order is untimely under HRAP 
Rule 4(a)(1). Consequently, we lack appellate jurisdiction over 
Maui Beach Resort's entire appeal. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Nordic 
Construction's November 7, 2018 motion to dismiss appellate court 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
case number CAAP-18-0000659 for lack of appellate jurisdiction is 
granted. 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions 
in appellate court case number CAAP-18-0000659 are dismissed as 
moot.
