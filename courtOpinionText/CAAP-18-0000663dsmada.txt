IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
ASSOCIATION OF APARTMENT OWNERS OF DISCOVERY BAY,
a Hawai# i Nonprofit Corporation, Plaintiff/Counterclaim-
Defendant/Appellant, v. BANK OF HAWAII, A Hawai# i Corporation,
Successor by Merger with HAWAIIAN TRUST COMPANY, LIMITED,
as Trustee of that Certain Unrecorded Trust Agreement
Dated June 6, 1974, as amended,
Defendant/Counterclaim-Plaintiff/Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 17-1-1104) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
appellate jurisdiction over Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/ 
Appellant Association of Apartment Owners of Discovery Bay's 
(AOAO Discovery Bay) appeal from the Honorable Gary W.B. Chang's 
July 26, 2018 interlocutory order denying AOAO Discovery Bay's 
amended motion for partial summary judgment as to Count 1 of AOAO 
Discovery Bay's five-count complaint and both counts in 
Defendant/Counterclaim-Plaintiff/Appellee Bank of Hawaii's (Bank 
of Hawaii) two-count counterclaim, because the July 26, 2018 
interlocutory order is not an independently appealable order. 
In the instant case, the July 26, 2018 interlocutory 
order does not adjudicate any of the parties' multiple claims. 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals from civil circuit court cases NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to the Hawai# i Intermediate Court of Appeals when a party appeals 
from "final judgments, orders, or decrees[.]" Appeals under HRS 
§ 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules 
of court." HRS § 641-1(c). 
Further, Rule 58 of the Hawai# i 
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document[,]" and no separate 
judgment has been filed in this case. 
Absent an appealable final judgment under the 
circumstances of the instant case, the only possible way for the 
July 26, 2018 interlocutory order to be eligible for immediate 
appellate review under HRS § 641-1(a) is by way of the collateral 
order doctrine. The Supreme Court of Hawai# i has held that under 
the collateral order doctrine "orders compelling arbitration remain appealable under Hawai# i's final judgment statute, HRS 
§ 641." County of Hawai# i v. Unidev, LLC, 129 Hawai# i 378, 392, 
301 P.3d 588, 602 (2013) (citation omitted); Siopes v. Kaiser 
Foundation Health Plan, 130 Hawai# i 437, 446 n.12, 312 P.3d 869, 
878 n.12 (2013). Nevertheless, the Supreme Court of Hawai# i has 
also observed that it "must construe the collateral order 
doctrine narrowly and be parsimonious in its application." 
Siangco v. Kasadate, 77 Hawai# i 157, 162, 883 P.2d 78, 83 (1994). 
Otherwise, "[a]llowing widespread appeals from collateral orders would frustrate the policy against piecemeal appeals embodied in 
HRS § 641-1." Id.
The July 26, 2018 interlocutory order does not 
expressly compel arbitration. Although the July 26, 2018 
interlocutory order reflects the circuit court's present 
reluctance to summarily adjudicate a subset of the parties' 
claims in light of an arbitration provision in a relevant 
document, the function of the July 26, 2018 interlocutory order 
is to expressly deny AOAO Discovery Bay's amended motion for 
partial summary judgment as to Count 1 of AOAO Discovery Bay's 
five-count complaint and both counts in Bank of Hawaii's two-
count counterclaim, without expressly compelling arbitration. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Absent language expressly compelling arbitration, the 
July 26, 2018 interlocutory order is not immediately appealable 
under HRS § 641-1(a) and the collateral order doctrine. In the 
absence of a final judgment, AOAO Discovery Bay's attempt to 
obtain immediate appellate review of the July 26, 2018 
interlocutory order is premature. We lack appellate 
jurisdiction. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court 
case number CAAP-18-0000663 is dismissed for lack of appellate 
jurisdiction.
