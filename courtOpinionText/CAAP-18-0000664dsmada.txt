IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
BS, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
NS, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
(FC-D NO. 17-1-0249)
ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL
(By:  Reifurth, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.)
Upon consideration of Plaintiff-Appellee BS's (BS)
March 7, 2019 "Motion to Dismiss Appeal Pursuant to Rule [sic]
12.1(e) and 30 of the Hawai[# ]i Rules of Appellate Procedure"
(Motion), the papers in support, the record, and there being no
opposition, it appears that:
(1) On October 16, 2018, the family court clerk filed
the record on appeal;
(2) On October 17, 2018, the appellate clerk notified
the parties that the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief
were due on or before October 26, 2018, and November 26, 2018,
respectively;
(3) Following two extensions, the opening brief was due
on or before February 4, 2019;NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(4) Defendant-Appellant NS (NS) failed to file the
statement of jurisdiction and opening brief, or request an
extension for the statement of jurisdiction or a third extension
for the opening brief;
(5) On February 13, 2019, the appellate clerk entered a
notice of default for the statement of jurisdiction and opening
brief, indicating the matter would be called to the court's
attention on February 25, 2019, for action that could include
dismissal, under Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP)
Rules 12.1(e) and 30, and NS could seek relief from default by
motion;
(6) On March 7, 2019, BS filed the instant Motion to
dismiss the appeal, under HRAP Rules 12.1(e) and 30, for failure
to file the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief;
(7) A response to the Motion was due on or before
March 14, 2019.  See HRAP Rules 26(a) & 27(a);
(8) NS did not respond to the default notice or the
Motion; and
(9) HRAP Rule 12.1(e) (2016) states, "Failure to file a
statement of jurisdiction may result in sanctions, including
dismissal of the appeal following notice and a meaningful
opportunity to be heard."  HRAP Rule 30 (2015) provides, in part:
When the brief for appellant is not filed within the time
required, the appellate clerk shall forthwith give notice to
the parties that the matter will be called to the attention
of the appellate court on a day certain for such action as
the appellate court deems proper and that the appeal may be
dismissed.
Because NS failed to file the statement of jurisdiction and
opening brief within the time required and received notice that
the appeal could be dismissed as a result, through both the
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
instant Motion and the default notice, the court will grant the
instant Motion and dismiss the appeal.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is
granted and the appeal is dismissed.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, March 19, 2019.
