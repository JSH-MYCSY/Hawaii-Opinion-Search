APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 17-1-412) 
ORDER 
GRANTING JANUARY 25, 2019 MOTION TO DISMISS
APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
AND 
DISMISSING ALL PENDING MOTIONS AS MOOT 
(By: Ginoza Chief Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.) 
Upon review of (1) a January 25, 2019 motion by 
Defendants-Appellees Pomaikai Holdings, Inc., doing business as 
Re/Max Properties (Pomaikai Holdings), Charles H. Aki (Aki), and 
Andrea A#ana (A#ana) to dismiss appellate court case number CAAP-
18-0000667 for lack of appellate jurisdiction, (2) the lack of any memorandum by Plaintiff-Appellant Christopher Young (Young), 
pro se, in opposition to the January 25, 2019 motion, and (3) the 
record, it appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction over 
Young's appeal from the Honorable Henry T. Nakamoto's July 25, NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2018 interlocutory "Order Denying Plaintiff's Motion Requesting 
Hearing Pursuant to HRCP Rule 55(d)(2) and Jury Trial for 
Punitive Damages, Declaration of Christopher Young in Support of 
Application for Default Judgment Filed May 15, 2018 and 
Declaration of Christopher Young in Support of Application for 
Default Judgment Filed May 14, 2018" (the July 25, 2018 
interlocutory order) because the circuit court has not yet 
entered a final judgment in Civil No. 17-1-412. 
Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 641-1(a) (2016) 
authorizes appeals to the Hawai# i Intermediate Court of Appeals 
from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules 
of court." HRS § 641-1(c). Rule 58 of the Hawai
#i Rules of 
Civil Procedure (HRCP) requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." Based on this requirement 
under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai# i has held that 
"[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor 
of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 
58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai# i 
115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). "Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves 
all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a 
separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai# i 245, 
254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008); Bailey v. DuVauchelle, 135 Hawai# i 482, 489, 353 P.3d 1024, 1031 (2015). The July 25, 2018 
interlocutory order is not a final judgment. On October 26, 2018, the circuit court clerk filed the record on appeal for 
appellate court case number CAAP-18-0000667, which does not 
include a final judgment. 
Although exceptions to the final judgment requirement 
exist under the doctrine in Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848) 
(the Forgay doctrine), the collateral order doctrine, and HRS 
§ 641-1(b) (2016), the July 25, 2018 interlocutory order does not 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
satisfy the requirements for appealability under the Forgay 
doctrine, the collateral order doctrine, or HRS § 641-1(b). See 
Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai# i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) 
(regarding the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 
Hawai# i
 319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding the three 
requirements for the collateral order doctrine); HRS § 641-1(b) (regarding the requirements for an appeal from an interlocutory 
order). Absent an appealable final judgment, we lack appellate 
jurisdiction over appellate court case number CAAP-18-0000667. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Pomaikai Holdings, 
Aki, and A #ana's January 25, 2019 motion to dismiss this appeal 
is granted, and appellate court case number CAAP-18-0000667 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions 
are dismissed as moot. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, February 6, 2019.
