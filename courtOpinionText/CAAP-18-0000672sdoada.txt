OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
AKM on behalf of AM, A Minor, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
RA, Respondent-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(FC-DA NO. 18-1-0563) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Nakasone, JJ.) 
Petitioner-Appellant AKM (AKM) appeals from the Family 
Court of the First Circuit's (Family Court) July 25, 2018 Order 
Dissolving Temporary Restraining Order [(TRO)], filed on March 13, 2018 (Order Dissolving TRO).
1 AKM filed a Petition for an 
Order for Protection on Behalf of Family or Household Member(s) 
(Petition) on March 13, 2018 on behalf of AM, AKM and Respondent-
Appellee RA's (RA's) minor child, which was initially granted, but later dissolved after an evidentiary hearing. 
1 The Honorable Steven M. Nakashima presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
AKM raises a single point of error on appeal, 
contending that the Family Court abused its discretion in denying 
his petition for a TRO on behalf of AM. Within that point of error, AKM also challenges Findings of Fact (FOFs) 4, 14, 15, 16, 
21, 22, 26, 27, and 28, and Conclusions of Law (COLs) 4 and 5, which are set forth in the Family Court's February 13, 2019 FOFs 
and COLs. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve AKM's point of error as follows: 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 586-3(b) (2018) permits 
a family member to petition for relief on behalf of a minor. If, however, the petitioner does not prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that "domestic abuse" occurred and that a protective order is necessary to prevent further abuse, a court can dissolve the TRO pursuant to HRS § 586-5 (2018).
2 HRS § 586-1 (2018) 
defines "Domestic abuse" as: 
(1) Physical harm, bodily injury, assault, or the threat of
imminent physical harm, bodily injury, or assault, extreme
psychological abuse or malicious property damage betweenfamily or household members; or 
(2) Any act which would constitute an offense under
section 709-906, or under part V or VI of chapter 707 
2 HRS § 586-5 states, in pertinent part: 
§ 586-5. Period of order; hearing . (a) A temporary
restraining order granted pursuant to this chapter shall
remain in effect at the discretion of the court, for aperiod not to exceed one hundred eighty days from the datethe order is granted or until the effective date, as definedin section 586-5.6, of a protective order issued by thecourt. . . .

committed against a minor family or household member by an
adult family or household member. [] 3
On appeal, AKM argues that the Family Court improperly 
focused only on AM's vaginal laceration and that the court abused 
its discretion in determining there was insufficient evidence to establish that domestic abuse occurred. AKM challenges the following FOFs and COLs: 
 
[FOF] 4. There was never any question in this case that
[AM] had suffered a tear to her vaginal area.
In fact, there was no dispute that [RA] was thefirst parent to have reported the vaginal tearand the report was made to [AM's] pediatrician,Dr. Nadine Salle, on March 10, 2018. 
On March 
12, 2018, [AM] was seen by Dr. Salle who made amandated reporter's report of the injury. 
. . . . 
[FOF] 14. 
Nevertheless, it was [AKM's] belief that
[RA] had been the perpetrator of the tearto [AM's] vaginal area. 
a. [AKM's] belief was based on his theory that [RA]had deliberately injured their daughter toretaliate against [AKM] and/or to have [AKM]blamed for the injuries to [AM] to create ascenario of domestic violence by [AKM] so that[RA] could get her green card as a victim ofdomestic violence[.] 
b. [AKM's] theories were based on allegedcircumstantial evidence which [AKM]believed proved his allegations that [RA]had caused the injury to [AM]: 
i. The rocky relationship between [AKM]
and [RA] seemingly from the start oftheir relationship. 
ii. [AKM's] belief that [RA] made numerousfalse statements, among other things, 
3 HRS § 709-906 (2014) prohibits physically abusing a family or
household member or refusing to comply with the lawful order of a policeofficer, as defined by the statute. Part V of Chapter 707 relates to sexualassault in the first, second, third, and fourth degree, continuous sexualassault of a minor under the age of fourteen years, indecent exposure, andincest. Part VI of Chapter 707 relates to promoting child abuse in the first,second, and third degree, electronic enticement of a child in the first andsecond degree, and indecent electronic display to a child. 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
regarding an alleged non-existent
miscarriage, regarding [RA's] priorrelationships/marriage with other men, andother alleged false statements. 
iii. [AKM's] belief that [RA] had caused otherinjuries to [AM] before the vaginal injury(see, allegations 5B, 5C. and 5D. of thepresent Petition). 
iv. [AKM's] belief that [AM] stopped havinginjuries from [RA] once he put up videocameras in their home. 
[FOF] 15. While [AKM's] theories were set forth with
fervor by both [AKM] and his counsel, the Courtfinds that the circumstantial "evidence" presented did not prove [AKM's] theories by apreponderance of the evidence. 
[FOF] 16. What was clear to this Court was that both 
Parties dislike each other intensely and arewilling to make accusations against each otherthat may be difficult to prove or disprove.Quite frankly, without corroboration fromneutral third parties, the Court was not willingto give either side the benefit of the doubt. 
. . . . 
[FOF] 21. 
Moreover, the Court finds that none of the
medical witnesses presented any evidence thatpointed to [RA] causing the vaginal injury, letalone, proving by a preponderance of theevidence that [RA] caused the vaginal injury to[AM]. 
[FOF] 22. The evidence from Dr. Salle was that she 
confirmed being informed by [RA] on March 10,2018 that [AM] had an injury to her vaginalarea. Dr. Salle confirmed that she told [RA]that if [RA] believed it was [AKM] who hadcaused the injury to [AM] that [RA] should take[AM] to the emergency room that very evening ofMarch 10, 2018. If [AKM's] theory was correctthat [RA] was trying to blame [AKM] for theinjury, [RA] would have had a perfectopportunity to raise the issue based on thepediatrician's instructions. But [RA] did nottake [AM] to the emergency room, instead [RA]treated the wound and took [AM] to see Dr. Salleon Monday, March 12, 2018. 
. . . . 
[FOF] 26. 
It was therefore, not surprising that DHS
concluded 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"After assessing all of the information gathered, the
DHS does not find any safety issues with eitherparent. The Department believes both [RA] and [AKM]would benefit from having individual therapy. [AM]would benefit from participating in play therapy. The DHS believes Foster Care is contrary to [AM's] bestinterest. The department has completed itsassessment, will not be confirming sex abuse and will
be closing the case." April 17, 2018 DHS Report
Letter. 
[FOF] 27. As set forth above, the Court was concerned
about the safety of [AM] when [AKM] filed his
Petition and obtained the TRO against [RA]. The Parties had already appeared before this Courtin their Paternity case and the Parties had madesimilar allegations in the Paternity caseregarding false miscarriages, alleged lies abouteach other's relationships with people in Nepaland India, and suspicious injuries to [AM].However, the vaginal injury was a brand newissue that had now occurred in the middle of the Paternity case. Thus, while the Courtconsidered the other issues that were raised in the TRO Petition, the primary issue that theParties and the Court focused upon was thevaginal injury. 
[FOF] 28. Based on all the evidence presented and the
Court's weighing of the credibility of theevidence presented, the Court finds that [AKM]failed to prove by a preponderance of theevidence that [RA] was the perpetrator of any ofthe injuries to [AM] that [AKM] alleged in hisPetition. In particular, so that there is noambiguity regarding the vaginal injury, theCourt finds that there was no medical evidence presented that the vaginal injury was caused by[RA]. . . . 
. . . . 
[COL] 4. 
Based on the findings, [AKM] has failed to prove
by a preponderance of the evidence that [RA]engaged in any conduct that would amount todomestic abuse or that a restraining order isnecessary to prevent the recurrence of abuse. 
[COL] 5. Accordingly, the Temporary Restraining Order
that was issued on March 13, 2018 is dissolvedeffective July 25, 2018 and the Petition in FC-DA 18-1-0563 is dismissed with prejudice. 
AKM argues that counsel for RA "beguiled" the Family 
Court into believing that the sole issue before the court was 
AM's vaginal laceration. However, the Family Court was 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
consistent throughout the litigation in its position that all 
evidence relevant to the allegations contained in the Petition would be considered. In addition, the record demonstrates that the evidence related to, inter alia, AM's head injury in 2017, and AM being upset in January 2018, during custody exchanges, was presented, considered, and addressed in the Family Court's decision to dissolve the TRO. In addition to the specific allegations set forth in the Petition, the Family Court permitted AKM leeway to testify about RA's alleged lack of credibility, motive to harm AM, and desire to "set him up." Thus, we reject AKM's argument that the Family Court was beguiled by RA and/or that it limited its inquiry to the events of March 10, 2018. 
AKM further argues that the Family Court's FOFs were 
clearly erroneous because they "omit the majority of the relevant and credible testimony that was presented which established that RA had committed 'domestic abuse.'" 
It is axiomatic that "an appellate court will not pass 
upon issues dependent upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence; this is the province of the trier of fact." LC v. MG, 143 Hawai# i 302, 310-11, 430 P.3d 400, 408-09 
(2018) (quoting In re Doe, 95 Hawai# i 183, 190, 20 P.3d 616, 623 
(2001)). 
When a party challenges the sufficiency of the evidence 
to support a family court's decision, 
[t]he question on appeal is whether the record contains
"substantial evidence" supporting the family court'sdeterminations, and appellate review is thereby limited toassessing whether those determinations are supported by"credible evidence of sufficient quality and probative 
6  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
value." In this regard, the testimony of a single witness,
if found by the trier of fact to have been credible, will
suffice. 
SG v. BA, CAAP-18-0000051, 2021 WL 164836, *4-5 (Haw. App. Jan. 
19, 2021) (SDO) (quoting In re Doe, 95 Hawai# i at 196, 20 P.3d at 
629). 
Here, the challenged FOFs were not clearly erroneous 
because they were supported by substantial evidence. Regarding AM's vaginal laceration, as AKM admitted, there was "no smoking gun" and there was no evidence linking RA to the laceration "other than motivation." During cross-examination, AKM acknowledged that he had no personal knowledge as to how AM's vaginal laceration occurred and that he could not provide any testimony as to how he believed the laceration occurred. The third party witnesses in this case - from the Department of Human Services, Forensic Medical Examiner Dr. Bob Bidwell, AM's pediatrician Dr. Nadine Salle, and Dr. June Ching, who conducted a forensic interview with AM at the Children's Justice Center -were unable to conclude that either parent was the source of AM's laceration. 
The Family Court's FOFs regarding the January 2018 
videos of AM being upset during custody exchanges were also supported by substantial evidence. The Petition alleged that AM not wanting to return to RA on January 21 and 25, 2018 "indicate[d] possible abuse by [RA]." The videos show that AM was upset during those two specific custody exchanges, but do not 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
indicate why she was upset. Further, AKM testified that AM was 
happy during other custody exchanges. 
The allegation related to AM's 2017 head injury was 
heavily reliant on AKM's speculation and conjecture as to how the injury occurred. AKM was asleep when AM was injured and testified that he believed RA deliberately injured AM because there was "no bump", that it looked like a "clean cut." AKM's argument relied on his testimony as to his belief about RA's "motive and opportunity" to harm AM. The Family Court, after evaluating each witness's credibility and weighing the evidence, declined to adopt AKM's interpretation of the evidence. We conclude that the Family Court did not abuse its discretion in determining that there was insufficient evidence to establish that RA had injured AM. The Family Court did not err in concluding that AKM failed to establish that RA engaged in conduct amounting to domestic abuse, and accordingly, did not err in dissolving the TRO. 
For these reasons, the Family Court's July 25, 2018 
Order Dissolving TRO is affirmed.
