APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 16-1-0313-02 JPC) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.) 
Upon review of (1) the Defendant/Counterclaim-
Plaintiff/Appellant John Hochroth's (Hochroth) already pending 
appeal in CAAP-18-0000465 from the Honorable Jeffrey P. Crabtree's May 4, 2018 amended post-judgment order granting in part and denying in part Plaintiff/ Counterclaim-Defendant/ Appellee Ally Bank's (Ally Bank) February 9, 2018 post-judgment motion for an award of attorneys' fees and costs (the May 4, 2018 amended post-judgment order awarding attorneys' fees and costs), and (2) the record in CAAP-18-0000676, it appears that we lack NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
appellate jurisdiction over Hochroth's appeal in CAAP-18-0000676 
from the Honorable Jeffrey P. Crabtree's essentially duplicative rulings in a July 27, 2018 judgment, purportedly pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the 
Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP), on the 
very same May 4, 2018 amended post-judgment order awarding attorneys's fees and costs, because the July 27, 2018 HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified judgment was superfluous for the purpose of perfecting John Hochroth's right to obtain appellate review of the rulings within the May 4, 2018 amended post-judgment order awarding attorneys's fees and costs to Ally Bank. 
In Civil No. 16-1-0313-02 (JPC), the circuit court 
entered an October 16, 2017 judgment on a decree of foreclosure in favor of Ally Bank, which Hochroth is appealing in CAAP-17-0000911 pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 667-51(a)(1) (2016). The circuit court also entered a November 20, 2017 HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified judgment in favor of Ally Bank as to Hochroth's counterclaims that was immediately appealable pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a) (2016), HRCP Rule 54(b), and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 
Hawai# i 115, 119, 
869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). Once a circuit court has entered a judgment (as HRCP Rule 54(a)  defines the word "judgment") and a 
party initiates a post-judgment proceeding, any resulting "post-judgment order is an appealable final order under HRS § 641-1(a) if the order ends the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be accomplished." 
Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 Hawai# i 153, 157, 80 P.3d 
974, 978 (2003) (citation omitted). For example, the Supreme Court of Hawai# i explained that a post-judgment order that 
finally determines a post-judgment motion for attorneys' "fees and interest is an appealable final [post-judgment] order under HRS § 641-1(a)." Chun v. Board of Trustees, 106 Hawai# i 416, 429 
n.12, 106 P.3d 339, 352 n.12 (2005). In the instant case, the May 4, 2018 amended post-judgment order awarding attorneys' fees 1

from which an appeal lies." HRCP Rule 54(a) (emphasis added).

and costs is an appealable final post-judgment order under HRS 
§ 641-1(a) because it finally determined, and, thus, ended the post-judgment proceedings for Ally Bank's February 9, 2018 post-judgment motion for an award of attorneys' fees and costs. 
Pursuant to the thirty-day time limit under 
Rule 4(a)(1) of the Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 
for filing a notice of appeal, Hochroth's June 1, 2018 notice of appeal in CAAP-18-0000465 is timely as to the May 4, 2018 amended post-judgment order awarding attorneys' fees and costs. 
In 
contrast, however, Hochroth's August 27, 2018 notice of appeal in CAAP-18-0000676 is not timely under HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) as to the May 4, 2018 amended post-judgment order awarding attorneys' fees and costs. Although in CAAP-18-0000676 John Hochroth purports to be appealing from the July 27, 2018 HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified judgment on the May 4, 2018 amended post-judgment order awarding attorneys' fees and costs, "the separate judgment requirement articulated in Jenkins is inapposite in the post-judgment context." Ditto, 103 Hawai# i at 158, 80 P.3d at 979. 
Clearly, the rule in Jenkins – to wit, that circuit court
orders resolving claims against parties must generally bereduced to a judgment and the judgment must be entered infavor of or against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCPRule 58 before an appeal may be taken – is limited tocircuit court orders disposing of claims raised in a circuitcourt complaint. 
Id. at 159, 80 P.3d at 980. "Accordingly, the time for appealing 
the matters conclusively decided by the . . . [post-judgment] order commenced upon entry thereof, not upon entry of the superfluous . . . judgment on the [post-judgment] order." Id. at 159-60, 80 P.3d at 980-81. Consequently, the superfluous July 27, 2018 judgment is not an independently appealable judgment, and Hochroth's attempt to appeal from it in CAAP-18-0000676 is invalid. 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court 
case number CAAP-18-0000676 is dismissed for lack of appellate 
jurisdiction.
