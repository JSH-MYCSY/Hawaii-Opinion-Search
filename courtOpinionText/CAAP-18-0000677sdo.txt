 Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve the 
points of error as discussed below, and affirm. 
(1)  Aloha Nursing first contends the circuit court 
erred in affirming Appellee-Appellee State of Hawai‘ i, Department 
of Human Services (DHS) hearings officer's denial of Aloha Nursing's standing on F.T.'s behalf, arguing the circuit court's 
construction of Hawai‘ i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 346-12 (2015) 
was too narrow. 
"On appeal, the issue of standing is reviewed de novo 
under the right/wrong standard."  Abaya v. Mantell, 112 Hawai‘ i 
176, 180, 145 P.3d 719, 723 (2006). 
Under HRS § 346-12, 
[a]n applicant or recipient, deeming oneself aggrieved, 
shall be entitled to appeal to the director in the manner 
prescribed by department rules and shall be afforded 
reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing at which 
all of the evidence presented by the parties, to the extent 
allowed by chapter 91, shall be considered in a fair and 
impartial manner. 
 
(Emphasis added.)  Applicant is defined as "the person for whose 
use and benefit application for services or public assistance is 
made" and recipient is defined as "the person for whose use and benefit services are rendered or a grant of public assistance is 
made."  HRS § 346-1 (2015). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 Here, Aloha Nursing has not shown it was the applicant 
or recipient as defined by HRS § 346-1.  Moreover, the hearings 
officer found "Aloha Nursing has not provided evidence that it 
is an authorized representative of" F.T., and Aloha Nursing did 
not challenge this finding.  See Okada Trucking Co. v. Bd. of 
Water Supply, 97 Hawai‘ i 450, 458, 40 P.3d 73, 81 (2002) 
("Findings of fact . . . that are not challenged on appeal are 
binding on the appellate court."). 
Aloha Nursing also relies on Hawai‘ i Administrative 
Rules (HAR) § 17-1711.1-9 (eff. 2013) for the proposition that 
it "acted responsibly on behalf of F.T."  HAR § 17-1711.1-9 
provides "[t]he department must accept an application for 
medical assistance and any documentation required to establish 
eligibility from an applicant, an adult who is in the 
applicant's household or family, an authorized representative, or if the applicant is a minor or incapacitated, someone acting 
responsibly for the applicant."  However, HAR § 17-1711.1-9 
covers from whom DHS can accept an application, not the 
appellate process. 
Thus, Aloha Nursing failed to show it had standing to 
appeal pursuant to HRS § 346-12. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 (2) Aloha Nursing next contends the circuit court 
erred in affirming the hearings officer's denial of Aloha 
Nursing's third-party standing. 
"In the ordinary course, a litigant must assert his or 
her own legal rights and interests, and cannot rest a claim to 
relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties."  
Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 410 (1991).  Under the test for 
third-party standing, litigants have a right to bring actions on behalf of third parties if "three important criteria are" met: 
(1) the litigant has suffered an injury in fact, thus 
giving him or her a sufficiently concrete interest in the outcome of the issue in dispute, (2) the litigant has a 
close relationship to the third party, and (3) there is 
some hindrance to the third party's ability to protect his 
or her own interests. 
 
In re AS, 130 Hawai‘ i 486, 513, 312 P.3d 1193, 1220 (App. 2013) 
(citing Powers, 499 U.S. at 410-11).  The supreme court has 
noted "the legislature may limit standing to sue despite an 
injury in fact where plaintiff asserts rights" arising from a 
statute.  Akau v. Olohana Corp., 65 Haw. 383, 390, 652 P.2d 
1130, 1135 (1982). 
Here, the legislature appears to have limited standing 
by enacting HRS § 346-12.  But even if we were to consider Aloha 
Nursing's argument, Aloha Nursing did not meet the test for 
third-party standing.  In this case, the hearings officer found 
DHS terminated F.T.'s Medicaid benefits in December 2012 due to NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 excess resources; DHS denied F.T.'s June 2013 application for 
assistance due to excess resources; and F.T. "had a legal 
guardian from January 29, 2013 to June 29, 2014" when she passed 
away.  As F.T. had a legal guardian from January 2013 (the month 
after DHS terminated Medicaid benefits) until she died, Aloha 
Nursing did not show F.T. was unable to protect her own 
interests.2 
(3)  Finally, Aloha Nursing contends the circuit court 
erred in failing to address the hearings officer's refusal of  Aloha Nursing's cross-examination of DHS's witness about the 
notice to terminate F.T.'s Medicaid benefits. 
The circuit court originally remanded this case for a 
hearing on whether Aloha Nursing had standing.  However, at the 
hearing on remand, Aloha Nursing attempted to cross-examine 
DHS's witness about the termination of benefits notice, DHS 
objected, and the hearings officer sustained the objections.  Thus, as Aloha Nursing's questions exceeded the scope of remand, 
we cannot say sustaining the objections was error.  See 
generally, 2 Am. Jur. 2d Admin. Law § 550 (2024) (noting "when 
the scope of remand [to an administrative agency] is limited 
. . . the lower tribunal is only authorized to carry out the 
 
2  As Aloha Nursing does not meet this prong of the test, we do not 
analyze the other two prongs.  See generally, In re AS, 130 Hawai‘ i at 513, 
312 P.3d at 1220 (noting all three criteria must be met). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 appellate court's mandate").  As such, the circuit court not 
addressing this issue is not reversible error. 
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the circuit court's  
August 1, 2018 Order and August 1, 2018 Judgment.
