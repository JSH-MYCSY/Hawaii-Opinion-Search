APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1CC171002013)  
 
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: 
Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
Appellant-Appellant Aloha Nursing Rehab Centre (Aloha 
Nursing) appeals from the Circuit Court of the First Circuit's  
August 1, 2018 "Order Affirming Notice of Administrative Hearing 
Decision Dated November 20, 2017" (August 1, 2018 Order) and 
August 1, 2018 Judgment. 1 
On appeal, Aloha Nursing challenges the circuit 
court's determination on standing and the hearings officer's 
exclusion of evidence. 
1 The Honorable Keith K. Hiraoka presided.   
 
 
 
  
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve the 
points of error as discussed below, and affirm. 
(1) Aloha Nursing first contends the circuit court 
erred in affirming Appellee-Appellee State of 
Hawai‘i, Department 
of Human Services (DHS) hearings officer's denial of Aloha Nursing's standing on F.W.H.'s behalf, arguing the circuit 
court's construction of Hawai‘ i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 346-12 
(2015) was too narrow. 
"On appeal, the issue of standing is reviewed de novo 
under the right/wrong standard." Abaya v. Mantell
, 112 Hawai‘i 
176, 180, 145 P.3d 719, 723 (2006). 
Under HRS § 346-12, 
[a]n applicant or recipient, deeming oneself aggrieved, 
shall be entitled to appeal to the director in the manner 
prescribed by department rules and shall be afforded 
reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing at which all of the evidence presented by the parties, to the extent  
allowed by chapter 91, shall be considered in a fair and 
impartial manner.  
(Emphasis added.) Applicant is defined as "the person for whose 
use and benefit application for services or public assistance is 
made" and recipient is defined as "the person for whose use and benefit services are rendered or a grant of public assistance is 
made." HRS § 346-1 (2015).

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Here, Aloha Nursing has not shown it was the applicant 
or recipient as defined by HRS § 346-1. Moreover, the hearings 
officer found "Aloha Nursing has not provided evidence that it 
is an authorized representative of" F.W.H., and Aloha Nursing 
did not challenge this finding. See Okada Trucking Co. v. Bd.
of Water Supply
, 97 Hawai‘i 450, 458, 40 P.3d 73, 81 (2002) 
("Findings of fact . . . that are not challenged on appeal are 
binding on the appellate court."). 
Aloha Nursing also relies on Hawai‘i Administrative 
Rules (HAR) § 17-1711.1-9 (eff. 2013) for the proposition that 
it "acted responsibly on behalf of F.W.H." and, thus, DHS was 
required to accept an application and any documentation to 
establish eligibility. Aloha Nursing claims that it submitted a 
"March 2012 request for an application (through [Scott Gardner & 
Company]) and its September 25, 2013 letter to DHS asking for Medicaid benefits from April 2012[.]" 
HAR § 17-1711.1-9 provides "[t]he department must 
accept an application for medical assistance and any 
documentation required to establish eligibility from an 
applicant, an adult who is in the applicant's household or 
family, an authorized representative, or if the applicant is a 
3   
 
 
 
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
minor or incapacitated, someone acting responsibly for the 
applicant." 
The hearings officer made findings regarding DHS's 
Med-QUEST Division Administrator, Judy Mohr Peterson's 
(Peterson) June 17, 2016 response to Aloha Nursing. Notably, 
Peterson stated that on March 28, 2012, Loraine Alambatin 
(Alambatin) of Scott Gardner & Company requested "a copy of 
[F.W.H.'s] eligibility review, as well as a statement of his 
income and assets, stating [F.W.H.'s power of attorney] had passed away and Aloha Nursing was starting the guardianship 
process." Peterson further explained, "[h]owever, there was no 
official documentation regarding guardianship proceedings taken 
by Aloha Nursing, and the verbal statement was not sufficient." 
Thus, "the department could not release information to her as 
neither she nor Scott Gardner and Company were designated as 
authorized representatives and had no legal authority for this information." 
Peterson also stated, "there is no record of any 
application being submitted until October 11, 2013, when the 
Department received a faxed copy of an application completed by 
Mr. Michael Orlas, of Scott Gardner and Company, nine months 
4   
 
 
 
  
 
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
after the guardianship hearing." Aloha Nursing does not 
challenge the hearing officer's findings. See Okada Trucking
Co.
, 97 Hawai‘i at 458, 40 P.3d at 81.  There was no evidence the 
March 2012 "request" and the September 25, 2013 "letter" were 
applications DHS was required to accept. 
Thus, Aloha Nursing failed to show it had standing to 
appeal pursuant to HRS § 346-12 or HAR § 17-1711.1-9. 
(2) Aloha Nursing next contends the circuit court 
erred in affirming the hearings officer's denial of Aloha 
Nursing's third-party standing. 
"In the ordinary course, a litigant must assert his or 
her own legal rights and interests, and cannot rest a claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties." 
Powers v. Ohio
, 499 U.S. 400, 410 (1991). Under the test for 
third-party standing, litigants have a right to bring actions on behalf of third parties if "three important criteria are" met: 
(1) the litigant has suffered an injury in fact, thus 
giving him or her a sufficiently concrete interest in the 
outcome of the issue in dispute, (2) the litigant has a 
close relationship to the third party, and (3) there is 
some hindrance to the third party's ability to protect his or her own interests. 
In re AS, 130 Hawai i ‘ 486, 513, 312 P.3d 1193, 1220 (App. 2013) 
(citing Powers, 499 U.S. at 410-11). The supreme court has 
noted "the legislature may limit standing to sue despite an 
5   
 
 
 
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
injury in fact where plaintiff asserts rights" arising from a 
statute. Akau v. Olohana Corp., 65 Haw. 383, 390, 652 P.2d 
1130, 1135 (1982). 
Here, the legislature appears to have limited standing 
by enacting HRS § 346-12. But even if we were to consider Aloha Nursing's argument, Aloha Nursing did not meet the test for 
third-party standing. 
In March 2012, F.W.H.'s power of attorney passed away, 
F.W.H.'s physician deemed him to be incapacitated, and Aloha Nursing through Alambatin sent a note to inform DHS of these 
events and that it "was starting the guardianship process." In 
July 2012, a petition for guardianship was filed, and in 
February 2013, a guardian was appointed. "Unfortunately, 
[F.W.H.] had assets in California which delayed his receiving 
Medicaid benefits," but he was later approved for Medicaid 
assistance retroactive to July 1, 2013 until his death on June 19, 2014. 
Since F.W.H. had a legal guardian from February 2013 
until his death, and "the delay in restarting the benefits was 
because [F.W.H.] had assets in California, not because [F.W.H.] 
6   
 
 
 
  
  
 
    
 
    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
did not have an authorized representative," Aloha Nursing did 
not show F.W.H. was unable to protect his own interests.2 
(3) Finally, Aloha Nursing contends the circuit court 
erred in failing to address the hearings officer's error "in 
preventing DHS's witness from testifying" about the notice to 
terminate F.W.H.'s Medicaid benefits. 
The circuit court originally remanded this case for a 
hearing on whether Aloha Nursing had standing. However, at the 
hearing on remand, DHS began asking its witness about exhibits including information from F.W.H.'s file on direct examination 
and the hearings officer cautioned DHS those questions would 
open "the door . . . to a lot of cross-examination questions." 
Aloha Nursing later attempted to cross-examine DHS's witness 
about when DHS terminated F.W.H.'s benefits, DHS objected, and 
the hearings officer sustained the objections. 
Thus, as Aloha Nursing's questions exceeded the scope 
of remand, we cannot say sustaining the objections was error. See generally, 2 Am. Jur. 2d Admin. Law § 550 (2024) (noting 
"when the scope of remand [to an administrative agency] is 
2 As Aloha Nursing does not meet this prong of the test, we do not 
analyze the other two prongs. See generally, In re AS
, 130 Hawai‘i at 513- 14, 
312 P.3d at 1220- 21 (noting each of the prongs must be satisfied).

limited . . . the lower tribunal is only authorized to carry out 
the appellate court's mandate"). 
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the circuit court's 
August 1, 2018 Order and August 1, 2018 Judgment.
