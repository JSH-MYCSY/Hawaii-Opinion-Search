APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 14-1-429K)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
Upon review of the records in CAAP-18-0000683, it
appears this court lacks appellate jurisdiction over the appeal. 
On August 29, 2018, Michael Miroyan (Miroyan ) filed a Notice of
Appeal "pro se" on behalf of Defendant-Appellant Hawaiian
Riverbend, LLC (HRL ), as its "owner".  Miroyan admits he is not
an attorney.  HRL is a Hawaii Limited Liability Company subject NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
to HRS Chapter 428.  "A limited liability company is a legal
entity distinct from its members."  HRS ยง 428-201 (Supp. 2004).
HRS ยง 605-2 (Supp. 2016) states:
ยง605-2  Attorneys; license required.   Except as
provided by the rules of court, no person shall be
allowed to practice in any court of the State unless
that person has been duly licensed so to do by the
supreme court; provided that nothing in this chapter
shall prevent any person, plaintiff, defendant, or
accused, from appearing in person before any court,
and there prosecuting or defending that person's,
plaintiff's, defendant's, or accused's own cause,
without the aid of legal counsel; provided further
that in the district courts sections 605-13 and 633-28
shall apply.     
"The prevailing rule is that a corporation cannot
appear and represent itself either in proper person or by its
officers, but can do so only by an attorney admitted to practice
law."  Oahu Plumbing and Sheet Metal, Ltd. v. Kona Constr., Inc.,
60 Haw. 372, 374, 590 P.2d 570, 572 (1979).  Although "any
person" may appear to prosecute or defend that person's own
cause, "[t]he federal courts have consistently construed a
federal statute similar to HRS ยง 605-2 (1976) as applying only to
'natural persons' and not to 'artificial persons' such as
corporations."  Id. at 376, 590 P.2d at 573 (citations omitted). 
The Hawai #i Supreme Court further held that "[t]he procedure
requiring a corporation to appear through an attorney in no way
deprives the [corporation] of its substantive right of due
process."  Id. at 378, 590 P.2d at 574.
As a limited liability company which is "a legal entity
distinct from its members," HRL cannot be represented in this
appeal by Miroyan, who is not a licensed attorney.  Therefore,
the notice of appeal filed by Miroyan did not constitute a timely
notice of appeal on behalf of HRL.  No other timely notice of
appeal on behalf of HRL has been filed herein.
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.  All pending
motions are dismissed as moot.
