Self-represented Defendants-Appellants David Lukela 
Kawelo, Sr. and Rochelle Nohea Kawelo (collectively, the
Kawelos)  appeal from the Judgment (

Judgment) in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee JPMorgan Chase Bank, 
National Association (

Confirmation of Sale Judgment was entered upon the Circuit 
Court's order granting Chase's motion for confirmation of the foreclosure sale of the Kawelos's former property, also entered on October 2, 2018.  The Kawelos contend that: 21

David L. Kawelo, Sr. Revocable Living Trust Dated April 28, 2001 and
Rochelle N. Kawelo as Trustee under that Certain Unrecorded Rochelle N. Kawelo Revocable Living Trust Dated April 28, 2001 were also named as defendants butare not parties to this appeal.

1. Chase lacked standing to maintain this foreclosure 
action; 
2. the foreclosure action was premature because the 
Kawelos were involved in a "loss mitigation process," and 
3. the Circuit Court should have given them more time 
to respond to the foreclosure complaint and conduct discovery. 
For the reasons explained below, we affirm the 
Confirmation of Sale Judgment. 
I. 
On May 14, 2008, the Kawelos executed a promissory note 
for $303,738.00 (Note) in favor of Amera Mortgage Corporation 
(Amera).  Amera endorsed the Note to Chase.  Chase endorsed the 
Note in blank.  The Note was secured by a mortgage (Mortgage) on 
the Kawelos's real property located at 89-906 Ihuku Street in 
Wai#anae, Hawai# i (Property ).  The Mortgage was recorded in the 
State of Hawai# i Bureau of Conveyances (Bureau of Conveyances). 
On August 16, 2011, Chase sent letters notifying the 
Kawelos that they defaulted on the Note by failing to make the payments due on April 1, 2011, and thereafter.  The letter stated that Chase would commence foreclosure proceedings without further notice if the Kawelos did not cure the default by September 20, 2011.  The Kawelos did not cure their default on the Note.  On April 4, 2012, an assignment of the Mortgage from Amera to Chase (Assignment) was recorded in the Bureau of Conveyances. 
On June 12, 2012, Chase filed a complaint for fore-
closure against the Kawelos, individually and as trustees of their respective revocable living trusts.  Chase filed an amended complaint for foreclosure (
Amended Complaint) against the same 
defendants on October 29, 2012.  Rochelle Nohea Kawelo was served with the Amended Complaint on November 7, 2012.  David L. Kawelo was served with the Amended Complaint on November 28, 2012.  The Kawelos did not file or serve answers or other responses to the Amended Complaint.  Their defaults were entered on February 6, 2013, pursuant to Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
55(a) (eff. 2000).3  The Kawelos never moved to have their 
defaults set aside.4 
On May 2, 2013, Chase filed a motion for default and/or 
summary judgment and interlocutory decree of foreclosure (MSJ). 
Copies of the Note, Mortgage, and Assignment were attached to a 
declaration supporting the MSJ.  The MSJ was set for hearing at 9:00 a.m. on June 19, 2013.  The Kawelos were served with the MSJ by mail on May 3, 2013.  The Kawelos did not file an opposition to the MSJ and did not appear at the hearing on the motion.  The Circuit Court orally granted the MSJ on June 19, 2013.  On July 17, 2013, the Circuit Court entered its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Default and/or Summary Judgment Against All Parties and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure (Foreclosure Order).  Also on July 17, 
2013, the Circuit Court entered a judgment (Judgment of 
Foreclosure) that contained a finding that there was no just 
reason for delay and directing entry of judgment pursuant to HRCP 
Rule 54(b) (eff. 2000).   Notice of entry of the Judgment of 
Foreclosure was mailed to the Kawelos on July 17, 2013.  The Kawelos did not file a notice of appeal from the Judgment of Foreclosure.

On November 7, 2013, without first seeking to have his 
default or the Judgment of Foreclosure set aside, David Kawelo 
3 HRCP Rule 55 provides, in relevant part: 
(a) Entry.  When a party against whom a judgment for
affirmative relief is sought has failed to plead or other-
wise defend as provided by these rules and that fact is madeto appear by affidavit or otherwise, the clerk shall enterthe party's default. 
4 HRCP Rule 55 provides, in relevant part: 
(c) Setting aside default.  For good cause shown the
court may set aside an entry of default and, if a judgmentby default has been entered, may likewise set it aside inaccordance with Rule 60(b). 
5 The Honorable Bert I. Ayabe presided over the June 19, 2013
hearing and signed the Foreclosure Order and Judgment of Foreclosure. 
6 A notice of appeal would have been due on August 16, 2013, unless
the Circuit Court granted an extension of time.  Hawai #i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure ( HRAP ) Rule 4(a)(1) (eff. 1/2012).

filed an "Affidavit of Remittance in Support of Attached 
Promissory Note."  On November 26, 2013, David Kawelo filed a "Notice of Default."  On February 12, 2014, David Kawelo filed an "Affidavit in the Nature Notice of Conditional Acceptance." Rochelle Kawelo did not file any documents and never sought to have her default or the Judgment of Foreclosure set aside. 
On April 20, 2015, Chase filed a motion for permission 
to sell the Property and for instructions from the Circuit Court to the commissioner regarding the foreclosure sale.  On May 11, 2015, the Kawelos filed a memorandum in opposition to the motion. They argued, among other things, that Chase lacked standing to foreclose on the Property.  Chase's motion was heard on July 28, 2015.  The Circuit Court orally granted the motion. 
On August 17, 2015, before a written order granting 
Chase's motion for permission to sell the Property was entered, Rochelle Kawelo filed a notice of bankruptcy and automatic stay pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 362.  On April 28, 2016, Chase filed a report that Rochelle Kawelo had received an order of discharge from the bankruptcy court under 11 U.S.C. § 727, and that her bankruptcy case had been closed. 
On January 31, 2017, Chase filed a motion to stay 
proceedings "to allow for a potential loss mitigation workout" with the Kawelos.  The motion was heard on May 2, 2017.
7  Chase 
made an oral request to withdraw the motion, which was granted. Notice of withdrawal of the motion was filed on July 14, 2017. The notice stated that the Kawelos's loss mitigation request had been rejected.  On August 14, 2017, the Kawelos filed a "Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiff's Notice of Withdrawal of Plaintiff's Motion to Stay Proceedings filed January 31, 2017." They argued, among other things, that Chase lacked standing to foreclose on the Property. 
The written order granting Chase's motion for 
permission to sell the Property without open houses was entered on November 3, 2017.  On July 2, 2018, Chase filed a motion for

confirmation of the foreclosure sale.  The foreclosure 
commissioner filed a lengthy report on August 6, 2018.  The Kawelos filed a memorandum in opposition on August 13, 2018. They argued, among other things, that Chase lacked standing to foreclose on the Property.  The motion was heard on August 16, 2018.  The Kawelos attended the hearing and addressed the Circuit Court.  Interested bidders were also present.  Bidding was reopened.  The high bid was $335,500, by Cui Mei Ho.  The Circuit Court addressed the Kawelos's arguments and granted the motion to confirm the sale. 
The Kawelos filed their notice of appeal in the Circuit 
Court on September 14, 2018.  The order approving the commissioner's report and granting Chase's motion for confirmation of the foreclosure sale and the Confirmation of Sale Judgment were both entered on October 2, 2018.  This appeal followed. 
II. 
In Mortg. Elec. Registration Sys., Inc. v. Wise, 130 
Hawai# i 11, 304 P.3d 1192 (2013), the Hawai# i Supreme Court 
explained that foreclosure cases consist of two separately appealable parts: (1) the order and judgment of foreclosure, and (2) all other orders.  Id. at 16, 304 P.3d at 1197.  Those two parts are treated as separate proceedings for res judicata purposes.  Id. at 17, 304 P.3d at 1198. 
The Kawelos's claims in this case — that Chase lacked 
standing, that the foreclosure action was premature, and that the Circuit Court should have given them more time to respond to the foreclosure complaint and to conduct discovery — could and should have been raised during the first part of this case (assuming the Kawelos were able to have their defaults set aside); i.e., before entry of the Judgment of Foreclosure on July 17, 2013.  As noted above, the Kawelos did not move to have their defaults set aside, did not file an opposition to Chase's MSJ, did not appear at the hearing on the MSJ, and did not appeal from the Judgment of Foreclosure.  They are thus barred by res judicata from raising 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
their stated claims in this appeal.  The claims the Kawelos could 
raise in this appeal are those "unique to" the Confirmation of Sale Judgment, such as a defect in the foreclosure auction or sale confirmation process, see Wise, 130 
Hawai# i at 16, 304 P.3d 
at 1197, or a "grossly inadequate sale price," id. at 18, 304 P.3d at 1199.  Since no such issues have been raised in this appeal, the Confirmation of Sale Judgment is affirmed.
