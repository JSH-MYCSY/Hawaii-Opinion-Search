OF THE STATE OF HAWAI‘ I 
SI, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
KI, Defendant-Appellant.  
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 3DV13-1-000147) 
SUMMARY DISPOSTION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant KI (Husband
), appeals from the 
Family Court of the Third Circuit's1 August 21, 2018 "Decree 
Granting Absolute Divorce" to Plaintiff-Appellee SI (Wife).2 
On appeal, Husband raises six points of error 
challenging the family court's division of the marital estate in 
1 The Honorable Dakota K.M. Frenz presided. 
2 Attorney Brian J. De Lima (De Lima) represented Wife in this appeal. 
Pursuant to Hawaiʻi Rules of Evidence Rule 201, we take judicial notice of
Case No. SCAD-22-0000068, that De Lima passed away in 2022, and that attorney 
Robert J. Crudele was appointed trustee over De Lima's legal practice.

its April 20, 2018 "Amended Findings of Fact, Amended 
Conclusions of Law, and Amended Decision of the Court" (Amended 
Decision) and the attached Property Division Chart. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve Husband's points of error as discussed below. 
(1) Husband's first two points of error concern the 
$25,505.00 and the $83,576.90 listed as Wife's capital 
contributions on the Property Division Chart. 
(a) The $25,505.00 
In addition to claiming that Wife hid this money, 
Husband contends that "[t]he evidence presented at trial does not support a legal or factual conclusion the $25,505.00 was a capital contribution," because there was no evidence linking that money to Wife's parents. 
All property that is not Marital Separate Property is 
Marital Partnership Property subject to equitable division under 
the partnership model. See Hussey v. Hussey, 77 Hawai‘ i 202, 
207, 881 P.2d 1270, 1275 (App. 1994).
3 Once Marital Separate 
Property has been identified and segregated, the family court 
must then "find all of the facts necessary for categorization of

P.2d 1272 (App. 1999).

the properties and assignment of the relevant net market values" 
for Marital Partnership Property. Hamilton v. Hamilton, 138 
Hawai‘i 185, 201, 378 P.3d 901, 917 (2016) (citations omitted). 
Here, the family court made conflicting findings. 
First, the family court found that it was "unclear where [the 
$25,505.00] originated from as [Wife's] income can be accounted for and thus was not the source" and that "[t]he trial record and exhibits admitted do not establish a clear record of the source of said cash[.]" But, the family court then found "that this cash was additional gifts to [Wife] from her parents" based on Wife's parents' past generosity to Wife. 
There was substantial evidence in the record to 
support the finding that Wife's parents were very generous with their daughter, including copies of checks written by Wife's mother to Wife. There is nothing, however, that shows the $25,505.00 specifically came from Wife's parents or any other source. 
Relying solely on previous gifts from Wife's parents, 
without more, the family court's finding that the money came from Wife's parents was clearly erroneous. See LC v. MG
, 143 
Hawaiʻi 302, 310, 430 P.3d 400, 408 (2018) (reviewing findings of 
fact under the clearly erroneous standard, and a finding is clearly erroneous if "the record lacks substantial evidence to 
support the finding") (citation omitted). Thus, the family 
3  
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
court abused its discretion in categorizing the $25,505.00 as 
Wife's capital contribution. See Brutsch v. Brutsch
, 139 Hawaiʻi 
373, 381, 390 P.3d 1260, 1268 (2017) (explaining that "the 
family court possesses wide discretion in making its decisions 
and those decisions will not be set aside unless there is a 
manifest abuse of discretion") (citations omitted). 
(b) 
The $83,576.90 
Husband contends the family court erred in failing "to 
find that [Wife's] parents' gifts were to both spouses to allow them to build their house." (Emphasis omitted.) Husband further argues "the [c]ourt erred by failing to recognize that Wife essentially gifted over the monies received from parents to 
Husband when the residence was built and both spouses acquired 
the residence ownership as tenants by the entireties." (Emphasis omitted.) 
In this jurisdiction, "marriage is a partnership to 
which both parties bring their financial resources as well as 
their individual energies and efforts." Hamilton
, 138 Hawai‘i at 
200, 378 P.3d at 916 (citation, internal quotation marks, and 
brackets omitted). 
The family court found that Wife's parents gifted 
$
83,576.90 to Wife, and that the money "was not a loan" because 
Wife's parents were "simply giving money to their daughter to 
help in a way most parents, who are finally [sic] able to do so, 
4  
 
 
 
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
would do." There was substantial evidence in the record to 
support the court's finding that the $83,576.90 was a gift to 
Wife from her parents. 
Wife's mother testified that the checks covering the 
Haihai Street expenses were made out to Wife, and that she never required Wife to sign a note.   Wife provided a summary of the 
Haihai Street home expenses for which Wife's parents paid. Additionally, the record contains photocopies of several documents that corroborate Wife's summary, including 
(1) $30,000.00 for the Honsador bond deposit; (2) $20,000.00 
placed in escrow for the conversion from a construction loan to a First Hawaiian Bank (FHB) mortgage; (3) $3,500.00 for the installation of a water meter; (4) $8,000.00 in closing costs; (5) $22,000.00 paid in 5 separate checks for the Haihai Street driveway project; and (6) $76.90 in materials from Home Depot. All together, these dollar amounts total $83,576.90. 
Husband does not cite any evidence in the record 
demonstrating that Wife's parents intended this money to be a 
gift to Husband and Wife as a couple. Wong v. Wong, 87 Hawai‘i
475, 482, 960 P.2d 145, 152 (App. 1998) (explaining that a gift
requires "(1) donative intent, (2) delivery, and 
(3) acceptance") (citation omitted). Similarly, Husband makes no showing that the $83,576.90 was delivered to him or to the parties as a couple.  
 
5  
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Husband also claims that Wife gifted these funds to 
him when she filed the Deed to the Haihai Street residence, and 
the parties moved onto the property. Husband cites Gussin v.Gussin, 73 Haw. 470, 487 n.8, 836 P.2d 484, 493 n.8 (1992), for the proposition that "[m]ost courts accept that separate property can be transmuted into marital property if the owning spouse designates joint title . . . ." However, the doctrine of transmutation was rejected in this jurisdiction. Wong, 87 
Hawai‘i at 482, 960 P.2d at 152 (explaining that "in divorce 
cases involving the application of the Partnership Model, the transmutation rule does not apply"). 
In sum, the family court did not abuse its discretion 
in categorizing the $83,576.90 as Wife's capital contribution. 
See Brutsch, 139 Hawaiʻ i at 381, 390 P.3d at 1268 (applying the 
abuse of discretion standard of review). 
(2) Husband's third and fourth points of error allege 
"the [family court] abused its discretion by failing to apply 
and allocate marital partnership principles to . . . joint property under the law to divide the property." 
(a) Wife's Tax Refunds 
Husband alleges he was "entitled to a fifty percent 
credit for the [tax refunds Wife] did not share" because she "admitted she took all of the tax refunds 2013 to 2015 and did 
not divide them with" him. 
6  
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"When divorcing parties file a joint return during the 
pendency of divorce proceedings, it is generally considered that 
a tax refund generated on the return is marital property and belongs equally to the parties." Leon Gabinet, Tax Aspects ofMarital Dissolution § 9:27 (2d ed. 2023). The family court may deviate from the partnership model where the facts "present any valid and relevant considerations authorizing a deviation." 
See Jackson v. Jackson
, 84 Hawaiʻi 319, 332, 933 P.2d 1353, 1366 
(App. 1997). 
Here, Wife did not file joint tax returns for 2013, 
2014, and 2015 while the divorce was pending: 
[Wife] testified, credibly, that [Husband] failed to 
respond to her requests for necessary documents to file joint tax returns. [Husband] throughout this case has notresponded or provided requested documents that related to
his income. As such, [Wife] filed Married Filing 
Separately since 2013. [Husband] testified that he has yetto file his 2015- 2017 income taxes nor was he sure if he 
had filed an extension for said years.  
The record contains substantial evidence indicating 
that Wife filed a separate tax return and maintained primary 
physical custody of the children for 2013 through 2015. The 
record also shows Wife furnished over half of the cost of 
maintaining the household where the children lived, while Husband failed to maintain the children's health insurance, causing Wife to pay out of pocket for the children's medical and health care on multiple occasions while the divorce was pending. 
7  
 
 
 
 
  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Husband also failed to pay child support and his half of the 
Haihai Street mortgage as ordered by the family court. 
Because Wife filed separately and the evidence in the 
record justified a deviation from the partnership model, the 
family court did not abuse its discretion by denying Husband's 
claim for half of Wife's tax returns. See Brutsch
, 139 Hawaiʻi 
at 381, 390 P.3d at 1268 (applying the abuse of discretion 
standard of review). 
(b) Savings Bonds 
Regarding $
4,589.12 in savings bonds, Husband contends 
the family court erred "by failing to credit [him] for fifty percent of the value of the savings bonds cashed out and kept by 
Wife." (Formatting altered.) 
The family court denied Husband's claim for a fifty 
percent credit of the $4,589.12 in savings bonds finding that 
Wife "testified, credibly, that the Savings Bonds were cashed out and used for their daughter's baby luau party and that [Husband] knew and approved of said use of the savings bonds." At trial, Wife testified that she cashed the savings bonds for her daughter's first birthday party, paying "all kinds" of bills 
such as the "produce company," the entertainers, the food, and 
"the cake lady."

"[A]n appellate court will not pass upon issues 
dependent upon credibility of witnesses and the weight of the 
evidence[.]" Booth v. Booth, 90 Hawai‘ i 413, 416, 978 P.2d 851, 
854 (1999) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
Because the family court found that Wife testified credibly as 
to the use of the savings bonds, we cannot say the family court abused its discretion by denying Husband credit for half of the 
$4,589.12. See Brutsch, 139 Hawaiʻ i at 381, 390 P.3d at 1268 
(applying the abuse of discretion standard of review). 
(3)
 Husband's fifth and sixth points of error allege 
that Wife drained her CU Hawai‘i account and their joint FHB 
account, and that he was entitled to credit for half the money 
that was removed from these accounts. 
(a) CU Hawai‘i Account 
Regarding $
13,675.00, Husband claims Wife "drained the 
credit union savings accounts over about a two year period" and that "[t]here was no evidence presented that the money was used for living expenses" because "[t]here was no proof of payment of bills by the credit union monies." 
As a general rule, charging of waste of marital assets 
to a divorcing party is applicable "when, during the time of the 
divorce, a party's action or inaction caused a reduction of the 
dollar value of the marital estate under such circumstances that he or she equitably should be charged with having received the 
9  
 
 
 
 
  
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
dollar value of the reduction." Chen v. Hoeflinger , 127 Hawai‘i 
346, 358, 279 P.3d 11, 23 (App. 2012) (citation omitted). 
Finding Wife's testimony credible, the family court 
denied Husband's request for a fifty percent credit of the 
$
13,675.00: 
[Husband' s] claim for a fifty percent credit of the 
$13,675.00 is denied. [Husband' s] counsel concedes that 
this is likely monies from [Wife' s] account with her 
mother. Regardless of its origin, [Wife] testified
credibly that this money was used to pay everyday living
expenses, especially given [Husband's] failure to pay his 
share of the Haihai Street mortgage, court ordered childsupport, and [Wife] and the children' s health insurance.  
Money was deposited and withdrawn to pay bills and expensesfor a period just under two years following separation. 
Both Wife's testimony and the evidence admitted at 
trial (including Wife's CU Hawai‘ i account statements that 
reflect several cash payments for the Haihai Street mortgage, 
the parties' joint credit card bill, and several other expenses) 
indicate that the money removed from the CU Hawai‘i account was 
used to pay living expenses. The record also indicates that 
Wife was paying for some of the children's medical expenses out of pocket. 
Husband does not present evidence on this point beyond 
his claim that Wife's testimony conflicted with his own. 
The 
family court found Wife's testimony credible. Again, we "will not pass upon issues dependent upon credibility of witnesses and 
the weight of the evidence." Booth
, 90 Hawai‘i at 416, 978 P.2d 
at 854 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).

The family court did not abuse its discretion by 
denying Husband's claim for a fifty percent credit of the 
$13,675.00. See Brutsch
, 139 Hawaiʻi at 381, 390 P.3d at 1268 
(applying the abuse of discretion standard of review). 
(b) First Hawaiian Bank Account 
Husband's final point of error asserts that Wife 
"drained the [FHB] accounts nine days after separation," and 
that he "is entitled to a fifty percent credit for the monies she did not share." 
"It is fundamental to recognize that marital waste is 
only a chargeable deduction if it occurs during the 
divorce[.]" 
Gordon v. Gordon
, 135 Hawai‘i 340, 354, 350 P.3d 1008, 1022 
(2015). Moreover, the "family court is not required to presume specific percentage splits in the division of each category of property[,]" although it must "exercise its discretion within 
the framework provided by our law." 
Id.
 at 352, 350 P.3d at 
1020. 
Here, the family court found that the date of 
separation was February 16, 2013. The family court denied 
Husband's claim for a fifty percent credit of $15,123.00 withdrawn from the FHB account: 
11  
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
[Husband's] claim for a fifty percent credit toward 
[Wife's] alleged draining of the First Hawaiian Bank Account in the amount of $15,123 is denied. This was not money jointly held in the account and then immediately
withdrawn upon separation as alleged by [Husband]. 
[Husband's] Exhibit CC shows a deposit for $15,123 onMay 14, 2013, and then an immediate withdrawal of the same amount also on May 14, 2013. There is insufficient evidence to deduce whether that was marital income/money or
[Wife's] parent's financial assistance. 
Wife testified that the $15,123.00 deposit came from 
the savings bonds she cashed out and that "the money was 
withdrawn to pay for some of . . . the baby's party 
obligations." The FHB statement shows there was a deposit for 
$15,123.00 on May 14, 2013, and a withdrawal for the same amount on the same day. 
Because the $15,123.00 deposit was made after the 
parties separated, the family court's finding that there was insufficient evidence to determine it was marital property was not clearly erroneous. Thus, we cannot say that the family court abused its discretion by denying Husband's claim for half 
of the $15,123.00. See Brutsch
, 139 Hawaiʻi at 381, 390 P.3d at 
1268 (applying the abuse of discretion standard of review). 
Based on the foregoing, we vacate the family court's 
Amended Decision as to the determination that $
25,505.00 was 
Wife's capital contribution, and remand this case for further 
proceedings consistent with this summary disposition order. 
Additionally, IT IS ORDERED that the appellate clerk 
shall mail a copy of this summary disposition order to Robert J.
