RL, Plaintiff-Appellee, v. DL, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
(FC-D NO. 11-1-0477)
MEMORANDUM OPINION
(By:  Leonard, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.)
In this divorce case, Defendant-Appellant DL ( Father)
appeals from two post-decree orders entered by the Family Court
of the Second Circuit  on August 31, 2018.  The first order
awarded to Plaintiff-Appellee RL ( Mother) a portion of Father's
bonus and modified Father's child support obligation.  The second
order awarded attorney fees to Mother.  We hold that the family
court correctly awarded Mother twenty percent of Father's 2017
"retention bonus," but erred by also including the amount of that
bonus when calculating Father's income for child support purposes
and, if income was imputed to Father for child support purposes,
by failing to make findings to explain why income was imputed in
the amount it was.  We affirm in part and vacate in part the
child support order, vacate without prejudice the order awarding
Mother attorney fees, and remand this case for the family court
to redetermine the parties' child support obligations and any
appropriate motion for attorney fees and costs filed by either
party.1

Procedural History
Father and Mother are divorced.  Their divorce decree
was entered on July 27, 2012.  They were awarded joint legal and
physical custody of their three minor children (collectively, the
Children).  At that time, Father's monthly gross income was
$11,667 (about $140,000 per year) and Mother's monthly gross
income was $5,127 (about $61,000 per year).  Father was to pay
child support of $2,445 per month until June 1, 2013, after which
the child support payments were reduced to $1,150 per month based
upon an equal time-sharing calculation.  Father received a credit
because the Children were covered under his health insurance
plan.  In addition, the divorce decree provided in relevant part:
Additional Child Support.  In addition to the regular
monthly child support, [Father] shall pay to [Mother] a sum
equal to twenty percent (20%) of any gross cash bonus that
he receives from his current employer . . . or any future
employer.  Within thirty (30) days of receipt of any cash
bonus, [Father] shall pay twenty percent (20%) of said bonus
as additional child support, and deposit the amount owed
under this provision into an account designated by [Mother]. 
At the same time, [Father] shall provide to [Mother]
documentation verifying the amount of the cash bonus
received.  [Father] shall also transfer to [Mother] twenty
percent (20%) of any restricted shares or other stock
payable to him as part of his annual bonus.  Any stock
options awarded to [Father] as part of a compensation
package shall not be included as additional child support.
For so long as [Father] is paying twenty percent (20%)
of his cash bonus and restricted shares as additional child
support, his cash bonus, restricted shares, and stock
options shall not be considered as income for child support
guideline purposes. . . .
Any request to review or modify monthly child support
shall also require a review of this "Additional Child
Support Provision."
Father was vice president and controller of a large
company.  In 2016 he received a salary of $144,200.  On
December 30, 2016, he lost his job when his employer ceased
operations.  On February 9, 2018, a self-represented Father filed
a motion for modification of his child support obligation.  On
July 6, 2018, Mother (through counsel) filed a motion seeking
enforcement of the divorce decree.  An evidentiary hearing on
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
both motions was held on July 31, 2018.  After the hearing was
concluded Mother filed a motion for attorney fees, costs, and
expenses.
On August 31, 2018, the family court entered an order
granting in part and denying in part Father's motion and granting
in part Mother's motion to enforce the divorce decree ( Child
Support Order).  This appeal involves the following provisions of
the order:
Modification of Child Support: [Father] shall pay child
support to [Mother] as and for the support of the parties
[sic] minor children in the amount of $1,889.00 per month,
$619.67 per child pursuant to the child support guidelines
worksheet attached hereto as Exhibit "A" effective as of the
date of the evidentiary hearing.  [Mother] shall receive the
health insurance credit for her payment of medical insurance
premiums for the children in the amount of $209.00 as
reflected on Exhibit "A".
. . . .
Additional Child Support: [Mother]'s request to receive 20%
of [Father]'s retention bonus for 2017 for the total amount
of $12,600.00 payable from [Father] to [Mother] is granted. 
[Father] shall remit payment of $12,600.00 directly to
[Mother], per the Divorce Decree [Father] shall pay
additional child support within 30 days.
The family court also entered an order awarding attorney fees to
Mother.
In this appeal Father contends that the family court
erred by (1) awarding Mother twenty percent of what Father
characterizes was his 2017 severance pay, (2)  denying a downward
modification of Father's child support obligation, and
(3) awarding Mother her attorney fees, costs, and expenses.
Standards of Review
[T]he family court possesses wide discretion in making its
decisions and those decision [sic] will not be set aside
unless there is a manifest abuse of discretion.  Thus, we
will not disturb the family court's decisions on appeal
unless the family court disregarded rules or principles of
law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party
litigant and its decision clearly exceeded the bounds of
reason.

Fisher v. Fisher, 111 Hawai# i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 (2006)
(citation omitted).
The family court's findings of fact are reviewed under
the "clearly erroneous" standard.  Fisher, 111 Hawai# i at 46, 137
P.3d at 360.  A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when the
record lacks substantial evidence to support the finding, or
despite substantial evidence in support of the finding, we are
nonetheless left with a definite and firm conviction that a
mistake has been made.  Id.  "Substantial evidence" is credible
evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to
enable a person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion. 
Id.  In addition, "[i]t is well-settled that an appellate court
will not pass upon issues dependent upon the credibility of
witnesses and the weight of evidence; this is the province of the
trier of fact."  Id. (citation omitted).
The family court's conclusions of law are reviewed de
novo, under the right/wrong standard, "and are freely reviewable
for their correctness."  Fisher, 111 Hawai# i at 46, 137 P.3d at
360 (citation omitted).  A conclusion of law that is supported by
the trial court's findings of fact and reflects an application of
the correct rule of law will not be overturned.  Estate of Klink
ex rel. Klink v. State, 113 Hawai#i 332, 351, 152 P.3d 504, 523
(2007).  But a trial court's label of a finding of fact or a
conclusion of law is not determinative of the standard of review. 
Crosby v. State Dep't of Budget & Fin., 76 Hawai# i 332, 340, 876
P.2d 1300, 1308 (1994).  When a conclusion of law presents mixed
questions of fact and law, we review it under the "clearly
erroneous" standard because the court's conclusions are dependent
on the facts and circumstances of each individual case.  Klink,

Discussion
1. The family court did not err in awarding
twenty percent of Father's 2017 "retention
bonus" to Mother.
The divorce decree provides that "[i]n addition to the
regular monthly child support, [Father] shall pay to [Mother] a
sum equal to twenty percent (20%) of any gross cash bonus that he
receives[.]"  Father lost his job on December 30, 2016.  On
January 13, 2017, Father received $63,000 from his former
employer; the remittance advice characterized the payment as a
"retention bonus."  On January 31, 2017, Father received
$35,238.96 from his former employer; the remittance advice
characterized the payment as "final severance pay." 
Mother's motion to enforce sought, among other things,
an award of twenty percent of Father's 2017 tax year "retention
bonus."  Mother did not seek an award of any portion of Father's
$35,238.96 "final severance pay," agreeing that "the severance
pay is part of income[.]"
Father did not dispute that he received $63,000, but he
characterized the payment as severance pay rather than a bonus.
He argued that the "retention bonus" label was just a "bucket on
my paystub[.]"  He did not introduce any evidence to controvert
Mother's trial exhibit 7: a letter to Father from his employer
stating that "[y]our final severance pay is $35,238.96," along
with the January 31, 2017 remittance advice showing "severance"
payment of $35,238.96.  The January 31, 2017 remittance advice
also shows that Father's total year-to-date earnings were
$99,721.80, consisting of the January 13, 2017 retention bonus
payment of $63,000, plus the January 31, 2017 severance payment
of $35,238.96, plus $1,482.84 for 21.39 hours of vacation.
We conclude that the family court's finding that the
$63,000 payment was a "bonus" was supported by substantial
evidence; we are not left with a definite or firm conviction that
a mistake has been made on that issue.  The family court
correctly applied the provisions of the divorce decree and
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
awarded Mother twenty percent of Father's bonus — $12,600.  That
portion of the Child Support Order is affirmed.
2. The family court erred when calculating
Father's modified child support obligation.
The family court calculated Father's modified child
support obligation based upon Father having "an average amount of
$200,000" in income.  During the evidentiary hearing Father was
shown Mother's trial exhibit 2.  He confirmed that in 2017 he
received $28,416 in unemployment insurance benefits, $24,058.46
in consulting fees, $59,264.25 withdrawn from his 401k retirement
account, and $99,721.80 from his former employer.   He agreed
that he received a total of $211,460.51 in 2017, but disputed
that all of it constituted "income."  That number in fact
included the $63,000 "retention bonus."  Under the terms of the
divorce decree:2
For so long as [Father] is paying twenty percent (20%)
of his cash bonus and restricted shares as additional child
support, his cash bonus, restricted shares, and stock
options shall not be considered as income for child support
guideline purposes. 
(Underscoring added.)  It was error for the family court to
include the $63,000 "retention bonus" as a component of income
for child support guideline purposes.
Father also testified that the only income he received
in 2018 was unemployment benefits of $1,184 every two weeks, and
that he was enrolled in a program to receive a master's degree in
business administration.  Also in evidence were Father's
interrogatory answers (Mother's trial exhibit 1) establishing
that since December 2016, Father had unsuccessfully applied for
more than eight financial and management jobs in Hawai#i, at
annual salaries between $55,000 to $125,000, and at least one
2As previously discussed, the latter amount includes both the
"retention bonus" and the "final severance pay," which total $98,238.96, plus
a $1,482.84 payment for accrued vacation time.

director of finance job on the mainland that paid $190,000 per
year.
The supreme court has explained:
[I]n determining gross income for calculation of child
support, the [Hawai #i Child Support] Guidelines permit the
family court to use "imputed income" when "a parent is not
employed full-time or is employed below full earning
capacity."  Haw. State Judiciary, 2010 Hawai #i Child Support
Guidelines 23.  When the parent is unemployed or under-
employed for reasons other than caring for the child, the
parent's income may be determined and imputed by the family
court according to the parent's "income capacity in the
local job market" and "considering both the reasonable needs
of the child(ren) and the reasonable work aspirations of the
parent."  Id.
P.O. v. J.S., 139 Hawai# i 434, 442 n.16, 393 P.3d 986, 994 n.16
(2017).  When the family court imputes income to a parent, it
must make findings to explain why income was imputed.  See I.S.
v. P.S., CAAP-10-0000082, 2013 WL 4458889, at *7 (Haw. App.
Aug. 21, 2013) (mem.) (remanding issue of father's child support
payments because family court made no findings as to why it
imputed a certain amount of income to father, did not indicate
the reasons for husband's limitation to full-time employment or
full earning capacity, and did not suggest or find that husband
was purposely not seeking work).  In this case, the family court
appears to have imputed income to Father, but it did not make
specific findings about why, or about how much income was to be
imputed, and the $200,000 amount imputed does not appear to bear
any relation to Father's "income capacity in the local job
market."  P.O. v. J.S., 139 Hawai# i at 442 n.16, 393 P.3d at 994
n.16.  The portion of the Child Support Order modifying Father's
monthly child support obligation is vacated; on remand, the
family court should redetermine Father's child support
obligation, if any, and if income is imputed to Father, the
family court should make findings to explain why income was
imputed in the amount it was.

3. The family court's attorney fee order is vacated
without prejudice.
Because we are partially vacating the Child Support 
Order and remanding this case for a redetermination of child
support, we vacate the family court's August 31, 2018 "Order
Granting Non-Hearing Motion for Request for Attorney Fees, Costs,
and Expenses" without prejudice to an appropriate motion for
attorney fees and costs being filed by any party at the
appropriate time.
