STATE OF HAWAIʻ I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v. 
DAMIAN LOO, Defendant-Appellant. 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 5CPC-17-0000312) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka and McCullen, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Damian Loo
 appeals from the 
Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit's August 30, 2018 Notice of 
Entry of Judgment of Conviction and Sentence, convicting him of 
Harassment by Stalking, in violation of Hawai‘i Revised Statutes 
(HRS) § 711-1106.5(1) (2014), and Use of a Computer in the 
Commission of a Separate Crime Relating to Harassment by Stalking, in violation of HRS § 708-893(1)(h) (Supp. 2016).

   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
circuit court sentenced Loo to one-year and four-year terms of 
probation, respectively. 
On appeal, Loo challenges the constitutionality of the 
Harassment by Stalking statute, the sufficiency of the evidence, 
and the denial of his motion to dismiss. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve Loo's points of error as discussed below, and affirm. 
(1) Loo first contends the Harassment by Stalking 
Statute "is unconstitutionally void for vagueness due to its 
failure to specifically define the term 'surveillance.'" 
Contrary to Loo's contention, the absence of a 
statutory definition for surveillance does not render the 
Harassment by Stalking statute vague. HRS § 711-1106.5 provides 
in relevant part as follows: 
A person commits the offense of harassment by 
stalking if, with intent to harass, annoy, or alarm another 
person, or in reckless disregard of the risk thereof, that 
person engages in a course of conduct involving pursuit, 
surveillance, or nonconsensual contact upon the other 
person on more than one occasion without legiti mate 
purpose. 
(Emphasis added.) Surveillance is defined in the dictionary as 
"close watch kept over someone or something (as by a 
detective)." Merriam-Webster, Surveillance Definition &
Meaning, Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary (2024), 
2   
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/surveillance 
[https://perma.cc/GE5N-49TU]. 
By applying the common meaning of surveillance, a 
person of ordinary intelligence would know that he or she is 
prohibited from engaging in a course of conduct involving 
closely watching over someone "on more than one occasion without 
legitimate purpose" "in reckless disregard of the risk" of 
harassing, annoying, or alarming that person. HRS § 711-1106.5. 
See State v. Alangcas
, 134 Hawai‘i 515, 530, 345 P.3d 181, 196 
(2015) (explaining the test for determining whether a statute is 
vague). Moreover, the same analysis shows "there is no concern 
of arbitrary or subjective police enforcement." Id.
 at 535, 345 
P.3d at 201. 
Thus, the lack of a statutory definition for the term 
"surveillance" does not render HRS § 711-1106.5 
unconstitutional. 
(2) Loo next contends "[t]here was no substantial 
evidence to support [his] conviction for harassment by 
stalking." 
The charging instrument asserted Loo, "in reckless 
disregard of the risk of harassing, annoying, or alarming, [the female employee], did engage in a course of conduct involving 
surveillance upon [the female employee] on more than one 
occasion without legitimate purpose[.]"

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Kaua‘i Police Department (KPD) Sergeant Scott 
Williamson (Sgt. Williamson) testified the surveillance camera 
that feeds Channel 1 monitors "the entrance to the cellblock, where the vehicles would pull up, the officer would wave their 
badge, and it would open the gate for them to pull in with 
prisoners." One day, Sgt. Williamson and KPD Sergeant Ginny Pia 
(Sgt. Pia) noticed the camera move and focus on a parking stall 
assigned to a particular female employee. The Channel 1 camera 
focused on the empty parking stall for about eight minutes until 
that female employee arrived. Sgts. Williamson and Pia then 
observed Loo in real time use the camera to zoom in and track 
the female employee as she walked from her car to the entry door. When she entered the building, the camera was returned to 
"its normally assigned position." 
Sgt. Williamson then reviewed the available video 
footage saved on the system, and determined Loo used the 
Channel 1 camera to monitor the same female employee in a 
similar manner on eleven separate occasions – March 22, 2017; 
March 23, 2017; March 24, 2017; March 28, 2017; March 29, 2017; March 30, 2017; March 31, 2017; April 4, 2017; April 6, 2017; 
April 7, 2017; and April 13, 2017. 
Evidence at trial also showed Loo admitted he had no 
legitimate purpose in zooming in and watching the female 
employee. 
Loo further admitted that he could understand why the 
4   
 
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
female employee would be "alarmed" upon learning his actions. 
The female employee testified she felt "shocked," "alarmed," and 
"scared" when learning of Loo's actions. 
Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to 
the State, there was substantial evidence to support the jury's 
conclusion that Loo, "in reckless disregard of the risk of 
harassing, annoying, or alarming, [the female employee], did 
engage in a course of conduct involving surveillance upon [the female employee] on more than one occasion without legitimate 
purpose[.]" See State v. Kalaola
, 124 Hawai‘i 43, 49, 237 P.3d 
1109, 1115 (2010) (providing the standard of review for 
sufficiency of the evidence); 
State v. Batson, 73 Haw. 236, 254, 
831 P.2d 924, 934 (1992) (explaining that "[g]iven the 
difficulty of proving the requisite state of mind by direct 
evidence in criminal cases, we have consistently held that proof 
by circumstantial evidence and reasonable inferences arising 
from circumstances surrounding the defendant's conduct is 
sufficient[.]") (cleaned up). 
(3) Finally, Loo contends the circuit court erred in 
denying his motion to dismiss the Harassment by Stalking charge as a de minimus infraction under HRS § 702-236(1) (2014). 
HRS § 702-236(1) provides: 
(1) The court may dismiss a prosecution if, having 
regard to the nature of the conduct alleged and the nature 
of the attendant circumstances, it finds that the defendant's conduct: 
5   
 
  
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(a) Was within a customary license or tolerance, 
which was not expressly refused by the person 
whose interest was infringed and which is not 
inconsistent with the purpose of the law defining 
the offense; 
(b) Did not actually cause or threaten the harm or 
evil sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense or did so only to an extent too 
trivial to warrant the condemnation of conviction; 
or 
(c) Presents such other extenuations that it cannot 
reasonably be regarded as envisaged by the legislature in forbidding the offense. 
Prior to trial, Loo moved to dismiss the charge as a 
de minimis infraction, and during a hearing on the motion, Loo 
argued in part that "the alleged facts is somebody was walking 
by and he watched her on a camera in a public area without her 
knowing, never told her." The circuit court denied the motion, 
concluding Loo "failed to show why his conduct did not cause or 
threaten the harm or evil sought to be prevented by [HRS § ]711-
1106.5" and "failed to present evidence of" the factors in State 
v. Rapozo, 123 Hawai‘ i 329, 344, 235 P.3d 325, 340 (2010). 
During closing arguments, Loo renewed his motion to 
dismiss the charge as a de minimus infraction, incorporating his 
prior arguments. The circuit court again denied the motion. 
That Loo secretly monitored the female employee, or 
that it was in an area where other employees parked, did not render his conduct a de minimis infraction. After reviewing 
Loo's arguments to the circuit court and the evidence adduced at 
trial, we cannot say that the circuit court "clearly exceeded 
the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles of law"
