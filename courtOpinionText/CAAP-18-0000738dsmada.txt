"Motion to Dismiss Appeal Without Prejudice" by Plaintiff-NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
Appellant County of Maui ( County of Maui ), it appears the parties
seek to dismiss the appeal, and once the dismissal becomes
effective, see Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP ) Rule
36, jurisdiction will revert back to the First Circuit Court. 
See Korean Buddhist Dae Won Sa Temple of Hawaii v. Concerned
Citizens of Palolo, 107 Hawai# i 371, 382, 114 P.3d 113, 124
(2005). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the stipulation is
refused and the motion to dismiss is granted in part.  The appeal
is dismissed as moot in light of the supreme court's opinion in
SCPW-18-0000733, and jurisdiction reverts back to the First
Circuit Court once dismissal becomes effective.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, January 23, 2019.
