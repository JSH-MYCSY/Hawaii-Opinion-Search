NO. CAAP-18-0000759 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I  
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v. 
BRADLEY PAI, Defendant-Appellant. 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
NORTH AND SOUTH KONA DIVISION 
(Case No. 3DTC-17-02487) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Reifurth, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record in appellate court case 
number CAAP-18-0000759, it appears that we lack appellate 
jurisdiction pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-
12(a) (2016).  In this appeal, Defendant-Appellant Bradley Dean 
M. Pai (Pai), pro se, appears to be appealing from the 
September 18, 2018 service of the Honorable Peter Bresciani's 
November 22, 2017 bench warrant for the arrest of Pai district 
court criminal case number 3DTA-17-02487.  At that time, the 
district court had not yet held a trial on Plaintiff-Appellee 
State of Hawaii's (the State) August 15, 2017 complaint against 
Pai for: NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(1) operating a vehicle under the influence of an 
intoxicant in violation of HRS § 291E-61 (Supp. 
2018), 
(2) operating a motor vehicle without a valid license in violation of HRS § 286-102 (2007 & Supp. 2018), 
and 
(3) operating a motor vehicle without proof of liability insurance in violation of HRS § 431:10C-
104 (2005). 
The November 22, 2017 bench warrant is not an independently appealable final order under HRS § 641-12(a), and, thus the 
dismissal of this appeal is warranted. 
"The right of appeal in a criminal case is purely 
statutory[.]"  State v. Nicol, 140 Hawai# i 482, 485, 403 P.3d 
259, 262 (2017) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The Hawai# i
 Intermediate Court of Appeals has jurisdiction "[t]o 
hear and determine appeals from any court or agency when appeals are allowed by law[.]"  HRS § 602-57(1) (2016).  HRS § 641-12(a) 
is the statute providing that "[a]ppeals upon the record shall be 
allowed from all final decisions and final judgments of district 
courts in all criminal matters."  Consequently, "in order to 
appeal a criminal matter in the district court, the appealing 
party must appeal from a written judgment or order that has been 
filed with the clerk of the court pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(b)(3)." 
State v. Bohannon, 102 Hawai# i 228, 236, 74 P.3d 980, 988 (2003); 
see also Rule 32(c)(2) of the Hawai# i Rules of Penal Procedure 
(HRPP).  In order to perfect a defendant's right to appeal from a 
district court criminal case pursuant to HRS § 641-12(a), the 
district court must enter either a judgment of conviction with a 
complete sentence, or an order dismissing the complaint without 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
prejudice, thereby terminating the proceedings and leaving 
nothing further to be accomplished by the district court.  State
v. Kilborn, 109 Hawai# i 435, 442, 127 P.3d 95, 102 (App. 2005) 
(regarding the appealability of a district court judgment of conviction and sentence under HRS § 641-12); Nicol, 140 Hawai# i 
at 491, 403 P.3d at 268 (Explaining that "under the Hawaii Revised Statutes, district court defendants . . . in . . . 
district . . . court may appeal from an order dismissing 
proceedings without prejudice."  (Citations omitted)).  At the 
time when Pai filed his October 4, 2018 notice of appeal, the 
district court had not yet announced any final decision that 
would be appealable when later reduced to a written judgment or 
order. 
Granted, six months later, on April 15, 2019, the 
district court entered a judgment dismissing the State's case 
without prejudice, which was an appealable final judgment under 
the holding in Nicol, and, furthermore, Rule 4(b)(4) of the 
Hawai# i
 Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) provides that "[a] 
notice of appeal filed after the announcement of a decision, sentence or order but before entry of the judgment or order shall 
be deemed to have been filed on the date such judgment or order 
is entered."  (Emphasis added).  Nevertheless, at the time when 
Pai filed his October 4, 2018 notice of appeal from the 
November 22, 2017 bench warrant, the district court had not yet 
announced any appealable final decision in the underlying case. 
In order for a defendant to invoke HRAP Rule 4(b)(4) for a 
premature notice of appeal, at the time when the defendant files 
the premature notice of appeal, the trial court must have already 
announced a decision, sentence or order that will be appealable 
and final when the trial court reduces that announcement to a 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
written judgment or written order. 
For example, in a premature appeal from an underlying 
proceeding for a criminal defendant's HRPP Rule 40 petition for 
post-conviction relief, the Supreme Court of Hawai# i held that, 
where a party filed his notice of appeal before the trial court's announcement of its final decision, that premature notice of 
appeal was a legal nullity that had no legal effect with respect 
to the written appealable final order that the trial court later 
entered.  Grattafiori v. State, 79 Hawai# i 10, 13-14, 897 P.2d 
937, 940-41 (1995). 
In the instant case, Pai filed his October 4, 2018 
notice of appeal before the district court orally announced any final decision that could be appealable.  Six months later, when 
the district court entered an appealable final judgment, namely 
the April 15, 2019 judgment dismissing this case without 
prejudice, Pai failed to file a notice of appeal from the April 
15, 2019 judgment.  Therefore, we are without jurisdiction to 
address the merits of Pai's appeal. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number 
CAAP-18-0000759 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
