APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By:  Wadsworth, Presiding Judge, and Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
Self-represented Defendants-Appellants Milagros Leano 
Castro and Benny F. Castro (the Castros) appeal from the 
following post-judgment orders entered by the Circuit Court of 
the First Circuit (Circuit Court):  (1) the June 28, 2018 "Order 
Denying [the Castros'] Renewed Motion for Relief from Judgment 
Filed May 3, 2018" (Order Denying Motion for Relief from 
Judgment); and (2) the September 4, 2018 "Order Denying [the 
Castros'] Motion for Reconsideration Filed on June 18, 2018" 
(Order Denying Motion for Reconsideration) (collectively, the 
Post-Judgment Orders).1/  For the reasons explained below, we 
affirm. 
1/ The Honorable Jeannette H. Castagnetti presided.   
  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
On March 31, 2014, Plaintiff-Appellee U.S. Bank 
National Association, as Trustee for Structured Asset Investment 
Loan Trust Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2006-04 (U.S. Bank), filed a complaint for declaratory relief and 
mortgage foreclosure against the Castros and others.  The Castros 
filed a response to the complaint, alleging that the purported assignments of the subject mortgage and promissory note were fraudulent and that U.S. Bank lacked standing to foreclose. 
On August 22, 2014, U.S. Bank filed a motion for 
summary judgment and for interlocutory decree of foreclosure. The Castros did not file an opposition.  The motion was heard on December 24, 2014.  The Castros did not appear at the hearing. The record on appeal does not contain a transcript of the hearing, but the Circuit Court minutes indicate that the motion was orally granted at that time.  On January 29, 2015, the Circuit Court entered findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an order granting U.S. Bank's motion for summary judgment and for interlocutory decree of foreclosure (
Foreclosure Decree).  The 
Judgment in favor of U.S. Bank and against all defendants was entered the same day.
2/  The Judgment was appealable under Hawaii 
Revised Statutes ยง 667-51(a)(1) (2016). 
The Castros did not appeal from the Judgment. On May 3, 2018, the Castros filed a "Renewed Motion for 
Relief from Judgment" ( 
Motion for Relief from Judgment),3/ 
purportedly brought under a variety of authorities, including Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 60(b)(3) and (4).
4/  
The Castros' argument is difficult to discern, but it appears 
2/ The Honorable Bert I. Ayabe entered the Foreclosure Decree and the 
Judgment. 
3/ The Castros' April 5, 2018 motion for relief from judgment was
stricken for failure to comply with court rules regarding service and notice
of the motion. 
4/ Although the Castros listed various statutes, court rules, and a
constitutional provision (the Fourteenth Amendment) in their motion, the onlylisted authority that could properly serve as a procedural vehicle for themotion was HRCP Rule 60(b)(3) and (4).  The rule states, in relevant part: "On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party. . . from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons:. . . (3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic),misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party; [and] (4) thejudgment is void[.]" 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
they claimed the Judgment was void under HRCP Rule 60(b)(4) 
because the Circuit Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Relatedly, the Castros appear to have argued that the promissory note was fraudulently endorsed; U.S. Bank did not own or control the note at the commencement of the foreclosure action; and U.S. Bank thus failed to establish its standing.  The Castros also argued that indispensable parties had not been joined in the litigation.  
On June 4, 2018, the Circuit Court denied the Castros' 
Motion for Relief from Judgment by minute order, and on June 28, 2018, the Circuit Court entered the Order Denying Motion for Relief from Judgment.  On June 18, 2018, the Castros filed a motion for reconsideration.  The Circuit Court denied the motion for reconsideration in a July 27, 2018 minute order, which stated in relevant part: 
[The Castros] have not presented new evidence or arguments
that could not have been presented during the adjudicatedmotion, e.g., [U.S. Bank's] motion for summary judgment,filed on August 22, 2014, to which [the Castros] did notfile an opposition . . . . 
(Letter case altered.)  On September 4, 2018, the Circuit Court 
entered the Order Denying Motion for Reconsideration. 
On appeal, the Castros raise eleven points of error, 
many of which are difficult to discern and appear to overlap, and all of which appear to challenge the foreclosure, as if the Castros had appealed from the Judgment.  See Nationstar Mortgage LLC v. Akepa Properties LLC, No. CAAP-15-0000407, 2017 WL 1401468, at *2 (Haw. App. Apr. 19, 2017) (SDO) ("[Appellant] makes little effort to address the requirements under [HRCP] Rule 60(b), but instead argues as if it had appealed from the Foreclosure Judgment.").  The Castros' sole discernible contention related to the Post-Judgment Orders appears to be that U.S. Bank lacked standing to bring the foreclosure action, which the Castros assert deprived the Circuit Court of subject matter jurisdiction.  Relying on Bank of Am. N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai# i 361, 370, 390 P.3d 1248, 1257 (2017), the Castros 
seemingly argue that U.S. Bank failed to show it had standing to enforce the note and mortgage at the commencement of the 
3   
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
foreclosure action, and the Judgment was therefore "void."  The 
Castros do not specifically invoke HRCP Rule 60(b)(4) in making this argument, but that appears to have been the basis for their related argument in the Circuit Court.
5/   
We review a circuit court's decision on an HRCP Rule 
60(b) motion for abuse of discretion.  PennyMac Corp. v. Godinez, 148 
Hawai# i 323, 327, 474 P.3d 264, 268 (2020).  However, "[t]he 
determination of whether a judgment is void [under HRCP Rule 60(b)(4)] is not a discretionary issue.  It has been noted that a judgment is void only if the court that rendered it lacked jurisdiction of either the subject matter or the parties or otherwise acted in a manner inconsistent with due process of law."  In re Hawaiian Elec. Co., 149 Hawai# i 343, 362, 489 P.3d 
1255, 1274 (2021) (quoting International Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. Carbonel, 93 Hawai# i 464, 473, 5 P.3d 454, 463 (App. 2000)). 
The Circuit Court did not err in denying the Castros' 
Motion for Relief from Judgment.  Under 
Hawai# i law, standing is 
not an issue of subject matter jurisdiction.  Tax Found. of Hawai# i v. State, 144 Hawai# i 175, 192, 439 P.3d 127, 144 (2019). 
The Castros make no other discernible argument challenging the Circuit Court's subject matter jurisdiction, and they do not contend that the Circuit Court lacked personal jurisdiction over them.  Similarly, the Castros make no discernible argument that the Circuit Court acted in a manner inconsistent with due process of law.
6/  Accordingly, the Circuit Court had jurisdiction to 
enter the Judgment, and it was not void under HRCP Rule 
5/ Although the Motion for Relief from Judgment also cited HRCP Rule
60(b)(3), this ground was precluded by the rule itself, because the motion was
brought "more than one year after the [J]udgment . . . was entered . . . ." HRCP Rule 60(b). 
6/ The Castros assert generally that U.S. Bank "[took] action in
violation of due process," but made no discernible argument below and offernone on appeal as to how they were deprived of due process.  See Citicorp Mortgage Inc. v. Bartolome, 94 Hawai i # 422, 433, 16 P.3d 827, 838 (App. 2000)
("An appellate court does not have to address matters for which the appellanthas failed to present discernible argument."); Hawai #i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure ( HRAP ) Rule 28(b)(7); see also Ito v. Investors Equity Life Holding 
Co., 135 Hawai #i 49, 74, 346 P.3d 118, 143 (2015) ("Where an appellant makes
general assertions of a due process violation, without further elaboration orcitation to authority, the court cannot reach a reasoned conclusion, and the
due process argument is deemed waived." (citing Cty. of Hawaii v. C & J Coupe
Family Ltd. P'ship, 119 Hawai #i 352, 373, 198 P.3d 615, 636 (2008))). 
4   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
60(b)(4).7/  Because the Judgment was not void, the Circuit Court 
did not err in denying the Castros' motion to set it aside. 
The Castros do not argue any error unique to the Order 
Denying Motion for Reconsideration. 
For the reasons discussed above, we affirm the 
following orders entered by the Circuit Court of the First 
Circuit:  (1) the June 28, 2018 "Order Denying [the Castros'] Renewed Motion for Relief from Judgment Filed May 3, 2018"; and (2) the September 4, 2018 "Order Denying [the Castros'] Motion for Reconsideration Filed on June 18, 2018."

7/ The Castros did not argue below โ or on appeal โ that relief was
warranted under HRCP Rule 60(b)(6).  The issue is thus deemed waived.  See Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Wailea Elua v. Wailea Resort Co., Ltd, 100Hawai #i 97, 107, 58 P.3d 608, 618 (2002) (arguments not raised in the trial
court are ordinarily deemed waived on appeal); HRAP Rule 28(b)(7).
