APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
NORTH AND SOUTH KONA DIVISION 
(CIVIL NO. 3RC 18-1-00091K) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, and Wadsworth and Nakasone, JJ.) 
Self-represented Defendant-Appellant Avon Laga (Laga) 
appeals from the Writ of Ejectment (Writ) and the Judgment of 
Ejectment (Judgment), both entered on September 18, 2018, by the 
District Court of the Third Circuit, North and South Kona 
Division (District Court), in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee Free 
Church of Tonga-Kona (the Church) and against Laga and other 
defendants.1/  After a bench trial, the District Court found that 
1/ The Honorable Margaret K. Masunaga presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
trespass had occurred and that the Church was entitled to the 
Writ and Judgment. 
Laga's sole point of error on appeal is that the courts 
of the State of Hawai# i do not have personal jurisdiction over 
her because she is a "Hawaiian subject[]" and the conduct at issue occurred "wholly within" the "Kingdom of the Hawaiian Islands."  
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as well as the relevant legal authorities, we resolve Laga's point of error as follows: 
Hawaii's long-arm statute, HRS ยง 634-35 (2016), 
provides, in relevant part: 
(a) Any person, whether or not a citizen or resident
of this State, who in person or through an agent does any of
the acts hereinafter enumerated, thereby submits such person. . . to the jurisdiction of the courts of this State as toany cause of action arising from the doing of any of theacts: 
(1) The transaction of any business within thisState; 
(2) The commission of a tortious act within this State; 
(3) The ownership, use, or possession of any realestate situated in this State; 
(4) Contracting to insure any person, property, orrisk located within this State at the time of contracting. 
Here, the District Court found that "trespass had 
occurred," with regard to Laga's possession of the subject 
property.  Laga was thus found to have committed acts enumerated under HRS ยง 634-35(a)(2) and (3), thereby submitting herself to the jurisdiction of the District Court.  
With respect to Laga's argument that she is not subject 
to the jurisdiction of the Hawai# i courts due to her status as a 
"subject" of the "Kingdom of the Hawaiian Islands," the Hawai# i 
Supreme Court has rejected such jurisdictional challenges.  See State v. Kaulia, 128 Hawai# i 479, 487, 291 P.3d 377, 385 (2013). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Writ of Ejectment and the 
Judgment of Ejectment, both entered on September 18, 2018, in the 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
District Court of the Third Circuit, North and South Kona 
Division, are affirmed.
