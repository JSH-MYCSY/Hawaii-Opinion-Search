APPEALS FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 12-1-1819)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Hiraoka, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Ah-Mei Chun (Chun ) appeals from the
"Judgment" ( Judgment Confirming Sale ) entered pursuant to the
"Order Approving Commissioner's Report and Granting Plaintiff's
Motion for Confirmation of Foreclosure Sale, Allowance of Costs,
Commissions and Fees, Distribution of Proceeds, Directing
Conveyance and For Writ of Possession/Ejectments" ( Order
Confirming Sale ), and "Writ of Possession", all entered on
September 7, 2018, by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
(Circuit Court).1
1  The Honorable Jeannette H. Castagnetti presided over the Confirmation
of Sale Proceedings. NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Chun's sole point of error in this appeal is that the
Circuit Court erred in entering its Judgment Confirming Sale
because Plaintiff-Appellee Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB,
D/B/A Christiana Trust, not individually but as Trustee For
Carlsbad Funding Mortgage Trust (Wilmington Savings ) failed to
establish its standing to foreclose under Bank of America, N.A.
v. Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai#i 361, 390 P.3d 1248 (2017).  
We affirm.   
On May 5, 2017, the Circuit Court entered the "Findings
of Fact and Conclusions of Law; Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion
for Default Judgment and Summary Judgment and Decree of
Foreclosure Against all Defendants" (Foreclosure Decree ) and the
corresponding Judgment ( Foreclosure Judgment ) in favor of
Wilmington Savings.  Chun did not appeal from the Foreclosure
Judgment, and thus the Foreclosure Judgment became final and
binding as to Wilmington Savings' right to foreclose on the
subject property.  See Mortg. Elec. Registration Sys., Inc. v.
Wise, 130 Hawai#i 11, 17, 304 P.3d 1192, 1198 (2013).
On February 13, 2018, Wilmington Savings filed a motion
to confirm sale.  The Circuit Court subsequently entered its
Order Confirming Sale, Judgment Confirming Sale, and Writ of
Possession on September 7, 2018.  This appeal follows.  
In this appeal from the Judgment Confirming Sale, Chun
does not challenge any aspect of the proceedings related to the
confirmation of sale of the subject property.  Chun instead
solely contends that the Circuit Court erred in entering the
Order Confirming Sale and Foreclosure Judgment because Wilmington
Savings failed to establish its standing to foreclosure under
Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai# i 361, 390 P.3d 1248.  However, as
explained in Wise where a defendant failed to appeal from a
foreclosure judgment, "[u]nder the doctrine of res judicata,
challenges to [the foreclosing party's] standing were subsumed
under the foreclosure judgment, which had became final and
binding."  Wise, 130 Hawai#i at 17, 304 P.3d at 1198.  Here, as
in Wise, Chun is precluded from challenging Wilmington Savings'
standing to foreclose.
