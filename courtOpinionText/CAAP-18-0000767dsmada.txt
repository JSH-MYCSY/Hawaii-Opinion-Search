STATE OF HAWAI
'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
ALFRED NAPAHUELUA SPINNEY, Defendant-Appellant,
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
KONA DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 3DTA-17-03816)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Chan, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record of district court criminal
 
case number 3DTA-17-03816 for the resulting appeal in appellate
 
court case number CAAP-18-0000767, it appears that we lack
 appellate jurisdiction pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 § 641-12(a) (2016). In this appeal, Defendant-Appellant Alfred
 Napahuelua Spinney (Spinney), pro se, appeals from the Honorable
 Charles Hite's September 13, 2018 order continuing trial until
 November 1, 2018, when the district court will adjudicate
 Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawaii's (the State) December 22,
 2017 complaint against Spinney for (1) operating a vehicle after
 license and privilege have been suspended or revoked for
 operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant in
 violation of HRS § 291E-62 (Supp. 2017) and (2) operating a motor
 vehicle without proof of liability insurance in violation of HRS
 § 431:10C-104 (2005). Under these circumstances, the dismissal
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
of this appeal from the September 13, 2018 interlocutory order is
 
warranted.
 
"The right of appeal in a criminal case is purely 
statutory[.]" State v. Nicol, 140 Hawai' i 482, 485, 403 P.3d 
259, 262 (2017) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The Hawai' i Intermediate Court of Appeals has jurisdiction "[t]o 
hear and determine appeals from any court or agency when appeals are allowed by law[.]" HRS § 602-57(1) (2016). HRS § 641-12(a) provides that "[a]ppeals upon the record shall be allowed from all final decisions and final judgments of district courts in all criminal matters." Consequently, "in order to appeal a criminal matter in the district court, the appealing party must appeal from a written judgment or order that has been filed with the clerk of the court pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(b)(3)." State v. 
Bohannon, 102 Hawai' i 228, 236, 74 P.3d 980, 988 (2003); see also 
Rule 32(c)(2) of the Hawai' i Rules of Penal Procedure. 
In the instant case, the September 13, 2018 
interlocutory order is not an appealable final order under HRS § 641-12, and, thus, it will be eligible for appellate review only by way of an appeal from a future appealable final judgment under the principle that, "[a]s a general rule, an appeal from a final judgment in a case brings up for review all preceding interlocutory orders in the case." State v. Adam, 97 Hawai' i 
475, 482, 40 P.3d 877, 884 (2002) (citations omitted). The district court has not yet entered an appealable final judgment.

HRS § 710-1077(5) provides that "[a] judgment,
 
sentence, or commitment under subsection (3)(a) shall not be
 subject to review by appeal, but shall be subject to review in an
 appropriate proceeding for an extraordinary writ or in a special
 proceeding for review." (Emphasis added).

 We note that, on May 23, 2018, the district court entered a "FINDINGS
AND JUDGMENT OF SUMMARY-DIRECT CRIMINAL CONTEMPT" against Spinney, finding
that Spinney caused a breach of peace and disturbance in open court. Spinney
was guilty of "summary-direct criminal contempt" in violation of subsections
(a) and (b) of HRS § 710-1077(1) (2014 & Supp. 2017) under the circumstances
described in HRS § 710-1077(3)(a) and sentenced to imprisonment for a term of
thirty days.

Absent an appealable final judgment under HRS § 641-12,
 
we lack appellate jurisdiction over Spinney's appeal. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number CAAP-18­0000767 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
