IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
IN THE INTEREST OF LI and HDK
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
(CASE NOS. FCS-14-1-0092 and FCS-15-1-0072)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
Mother-Appellant (Mother ) appeals from a September 21,
2018 Order Terminating Parental Rights ( Termination Order), in
which the Family Court of the Second Circuit ( Family Court)
terminated her parental rights to her children, LI and HDK
(collectively, the Children ), appointed the Director of Human
Services ( DHS) to have permanent custody of the Children, and
ordered a Permanent Plan as modified, dated July 6, 2018.  21
Mother argues the Family Court wrongly terminated her
parental rights when it:  (1) failed to timely hold the

permanency hearing, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS)
§ 587A-31(g); (2) failed to timely appoint an attorney to
represent her in the proceedings; and (3) terminated her parental
rights based on insufficient evidence.  3
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve Mother's points of error as follows:
(1) Mother argues that the Family Court violated HRS
§ 587A-31(g) and Mother's due process rights by failing to
conduct a permanency hearing within twelve months of the dates
that the Children entered foster care. 
HRS § 587A-31(g) (2018) provides:
If the child has been in foster care under the
responsibility of the department for a total of twelve
consecutive months or an aggregate of fifteen out of the
most recent twenty-two months from the date of entry into
foster care, the department shall file a motion to terminate
parental rights[.]
LI's date of entry into foster care was January 13,
2015 and HDK's was August 19, 2015.  The Children remained in
foster care from those dates on.  On July 6, 2018, DHS filed the
motion to terminate parental rights.  DHS was plainly dilatory in
carrying out its statutory duties in this case.  The record is
3Mother fails to state where in the record any of the alleged
errors were objected to or the manner in which they were brought to the Family
Court's attention, as required by the Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure
(HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4) and Rules Expediting Child Protective Appeals Rule
11(a)(3)(C).  Nevertheless, we review Mother's points of error given the
gravity of the matter and the court's policy of "affording litigants the
opportunity to have their cases heard on the merits, where possible."  Marvin
v. Pflueger, 127 Hawai #i 490, 498, 280 P.3d 88, 96 (2012) (citation and
internal quotation marks omitted).  Counsel for Mother is cautioned to comply
with HRAP Rule 28(b)(4) in future appeals. 
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
silent as to why DHS did not file a motion earlier, as required
by the statute.  However, the record does not reflect that Mother
objected to the delay below, and the point is waived.  See HRAP
Rule 28(b)(4)(iii); In re Doe, 99 Hawai#i 522, 537, 57 P.3d 447,
462 (2002) (failure to object amounts to a waiver of claim on
appeal).
Even if the point was not waived, it is unclear how
Mother was harmed by the delay, which appears to have allowed
Mother additional time to come into compliance with the
conditions of her service plans.  Mother has not shown that the
alleged error affected her substantial rights.  Therefore, we
conclude that any error was harmless.  See Hawai# i Family Court
Rules Rule 61; In re Doe, 99 Hawai#i at 534 n.18, 57 P.3d at 459
n.18 (emphasis omitted) ("The appellate courts of this
jurisdiction have . . . applied procedural due process protection
only where an individual's rights are substantially affected."). 
(2) Mother argues that the Family Court abused its
discretion by failing to appoint counsel for her until ninety-
seven days after LI was placed in foster custody.  She cites to
In re TM, 131 Hawai#i 419, 319 P.3d 338 (2014), to support her
argument.  In TM, the Hawai# i Supreme Court clearly held that
"trial courts must appoint counsel for indigent parents upon the
granting of a petition to DHS for temporary foster custody of
their children."  Id. at 436, 319 P.3d at 355 (emphasis added).
Here, at the time of their births, both of the Children
were found to have illegal drugs in their systems.  Mother
initially stipulated to the Family Court taking jurisdiction in
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
the case of LI, and on June 24, 2014, the Family Court granted
DHS's Petition for Family Supervision of Mother and LI.  On
January 9, 2015, DHS filed a Safe Family Home Report,
recommending that the Family Court award DHS foster custody of
LI.  On January 13, 2015, the Family Court held a periodic review
hearing.  After the Family Court announced it was awarding foster
custody to the State, while the court was talking to Mother and
before all issues had been addressed, Mother abruptly left the
courtroom.  After Mother left, DHS Social Worker Christina Satyo
Dosland remarked that Mother needed an attorney, and the Family
Court responded "if someone can talk to [Mother] and . . . just
give her the application, maybe we can deal with it when we come
back April 14th [2015]."  
At that point in the proceedings, under the supreme
court's directive in TM, the Family Court was required to appoint
counsel for Mother if she was indigent.  Suggesting that the
court would "maybe" deal with the appointment of counsel three
months later was inadequate.  While Mother's departure from the
courtroom was unhelpful, it is clear from the record that Mother
was under a great deal of stress, had very recently been
homeless, and was having significant difficulty coping with the
courtroom procedures.   While each case has its specific
circumstances, the supreme court's determination that indigent4

therapy so badly."
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
parents have a due process right to have counsel appointed at
this juncture is clear and well-founded.
On January 21, 2015, the Family Court entered a written
order revoking family supervision and granting DHS foster custody
of LI, effective January 13, 2015. 
 On April 14, 2015, the Family Court held a periodic
review hearing, at which Guardian Ad Litem John Baker ( Baker)
explained he had submitted Mother's Application for Court-
Appointed Counsel for filing  in the Family Court, on her behalf,
but Mother needed to answer a question about the application.  A
message was left on Mother's voicemail, but she had not
responded.  5
On April 20, 2015, the Family Court filed an Amended
Order Appointing Counsel, appointing Renata Foster-Au to
represent Mother, effective April 14, 2015.  On the same date,
Mother's Application for Court-Appointed Counsel, which she
signed on April 6, 2015, was filed in the Family Court. 
Subsequently, in June of 2015, HDK was born and DHS
assumed temporary foster custody of HDK.
Mother was divested of custody of LI when the Family
Court awarded DHS foster custody, effective January 13, 2015.
Therefore, as stated above, the Family Court was required to
appoint counsel for Mother at that time if she was indigent.  See
5  Baker stated that he filed the application, but it appears he only
submitted it for filing because the application was not filed until April 20,
2015.

TM, 131 Hawai# i at 436, 319 P.3d at 355.  The Family Court did
not appoint Mother's counsel until after the hearing on April 14,
2015.  At that hearing, other than continuing foster care, the
court took no further action and continued the return and
periodic review hearing to May 5, 2015, so that Mother could be
represented by counsel.
On this appeal, Mother asks this court to enforce the
"bright-line rule" established in TM, does not identify any
prejudice or harm to Mother, and submits that violation of the
supreme court's holding nevertheless requires reversal and
remand.  While the Family Court has been directed, in every case,
to appoint counsel for an indigent parent upon the granting of a
petition for foster custody, under the circumstances of this
case, we are reluctant to vacate the Termination Order on this
ground.  The delay of three months was impermissible, but it
appears that Mother's early departure from the courtroom on
January 13, 2015, her failure to provide DHS a specific street
address for her new residence, and her inconsistent responses to
voicemail messages and instructions for completing the paperwork
necessary to establish her indigency all contributed greatly to
the delay.  Mother has declined to identify any prejudice and
none is apparent from the record.  Counsel was appointed before
any further action was taken and Mother was thereafter
represented at all further proceedings.  It was not until
literally years later, as Mother has pointed out, that DHS moved
forward with its petition to terminate Mother's parental rights. 
6NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
While not condoning the delay in the appointment of counsel in
this case, on the record before us, we decline to vacate the
Termination Order on this ground.
(3) Mother argues that there was insufficient evidence
to support the Termination Order.  She maintains that the State
presented no evidence that she harmed Children, according to the
definition of "harm" in HRS § 587A-4, and that the Family Court
accorded too much weight to DHS's assessments and too little to
her progress in court-ordered services. 
Although "initial and any subsequent reports of harm
and threatened harm to the child" are factors the Family Court
must consider when determining whether to terminate parental
rights, a finding of harm is not required.  See HRS § 587A-7
(2018) and HRS § 587A-33 (2018).  Here, the Family Court found
that "[a]t the time of their respective births, both [C]hildren]
were found to have illegal drugs in their systems," and the
record reflects that the drug was methamphetamine.  Included in
the definition of "harm" set forth in HRS § 587A-4 (2018), is
"damage or injury to a child's physical or psychological health
or welfare, where . . . [t]he child is provided with dangerous .
. . drugs as defined in section 712-1240[.]"  According to HRS §
712-1240 (2014), a substance specified as a "Schedule II
substance" by HRS chapter 329 is a "dangerous drug."  HRS § 329-
16(e)(2) (2015) includes in Schedule II any substance containing
methamphetamine.
7NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
The appellate courts have consistently upheld the
termination of parental rights based in part on a parent's
failure to address his or her substance abuse problem.  See,
e.g., In re BP, 112 Hawai#i 309, 312, 145 P.3d 852, 855 (App.
2006); In re P Children, CAAP-16-0000696, 2017 WL 2829537, *3
(Haw. App. June 29, 2017) (SDO); In re KC No. 30257, 2010 WL
5409433, *2 (Haw. App. Dec. 30, 2010) (SDO).
Mother argues that the Family Court improperly weighed
the evidence.  However, "[t]he appellate courts will give due
deference to the right of the trier of fact to determine
credibility, weigh the evidence, and draw reasonable inferences
from the evidence adduced."  See In re Doe, 107 Hawai# i 12, 19,
108 P.3d 966, 973 (2005) (citation and internal quotation marks  
omitted). 
The Family Court's written findings provide, in
relevant part:
4.  The [DHS] began providing services for the Mother
of both [Children] in 2015.  At that time, both minors were
removed from the Mother's care and placed in foster care due
to the Mother's inability to care for them and because of
ongoing substance abuse.
5.  The Mother has been provided numerous service
plans by [DHS] and over the years she has been provided
services.  The service plans have consistently contained a
component regarding substance abuse treatment, as part of
each plan.  Mother has consistently failed to comply with
the conditions of the service plans.
6.  Evidence was presented at the hearing that the
Mother, currently on probation with the Second Circuit
Court, State of Hawaii for criminal violations, admitted to
being in violation of her conditions of probation.
7.  On July 24, 2018, at the hearing on the State's
Motion to Revoke Probation, the Mother admitted to drug use.
Said violation was for a finding of methamphetamine in the
Mother's blood.  Substance abuse has been, and remains an 
8NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
ongoing problem for the Mother during the lifetime of
[Children].
8.  The Mother was sentenced to jail for her
violation.
9.  The Mother presented evidence of recent, short
term employment.
10.  The Mother presented evidence of various
residences where she has resided in the last year.
Mother does not challenge any of the Family Court's
FOFs and, therefore, the court is bound by them.  See Poe v.
Hawai#i Labor Relations Bd., 97 Hawai ‘i 528, 536, 40 P.3d 930,
938 (2002) (citations omitted); In re BP, 112 Hawai#i at 312, 145
P.3d at 855.
Based on the record and the Family Court's unchallenged
findings, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to
support the Family Court's conclusion that Mother was unable to
provide a safe family home, even with the assistance of a service
plan, and she would not become willing or able to do so in the
reasonably foreseeable future.
For these reasons, the Family Court's September 21,
2018 Termination Order is affirmed.
