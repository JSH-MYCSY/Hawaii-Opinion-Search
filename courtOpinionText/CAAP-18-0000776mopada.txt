Because Jones is self-represented, we interpret
her brief liberally and address the arguments we are able to discern. See 
Erum v. Llego, 147 Hawai #i 368, 380-81, 465 P.3d 815, 827-28 (2020)

 STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
An order granting a Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure 
(
HRCP) Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings is 
reviewed de novo. In re Off. of Info. Pracs. Op. Letter No. 
F16-01, 147 Hawai# i 286, 294, 465 P.3d 733, 741 (2020). 
In a motion for judgment on the pleadings under HRCP
Rule 12(c), the movant must clearly establish that nomaterial issue of fact remains to be resolved and that theyare entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In consideringa motion for judgment on the pleadings, the trial court isrequired to view the facts presented in the pleadings andthe inferences to be drawn therefrom in the light mostfavorable to the nonmoving party. 
Our task on appeal is to determine whether the circuit
court's order supports its conclusion that the movant isentitled to judgment as a matter of law and, by implication,that it appears beyond a doubt that the nonmoving party canprove no set of facts in support of its claim that wouldentitle it to relief under any alternative theory. 
Id. (cleaned up). 
An order granting summary judgment is also reviewed de 
novo. Nozawa v. Operating Engineers Local Union No. 3, 142 
Hawai# i 331, 338, 418 P.3d 1187, 1194 (2018). Summary judgment 
is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, answers to 
interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Id. at 342, 418 P.3d at 1198. A fact is 
material if proof of that fact would have the effect of establishing or refuting one of the essential elements of a cause of action or defense asserted by the parties. Id.
DISCUSSION 
I. The Medical Board's Motion 
The Medical Board made three legal arguments: (1) there 
is no private cause of action for alleged violation of the Health 
Care Quality Improvement Act; (2) Jones's tort claims are barred by sovereign immunity; and (3) Jones's libel and defamations claims are precluded by a judgment in a previous lawsuit. 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
A. The Health Care Quality Improvement Act did
not create a private cause of action. 
The federal Health Care Quality Improvement Act: 
was enacted in 1986 to improve the quality of medical careby restricting the ability of physicians who have been foundto be incompetent from repeating this malpractice by movingfrom state to state without discovery of such finding.Toward this end, the Act establishes a national reportingsystem "to follow bad doctors from place to place," andprovides immunity from damages for persons participating inprofessional review activities. Under the national reporting system, insurance companies are required to reportmedical malpractice payments to the Secretary of Health andHuman Services; boards of medical examiners are required toreport sanctions imposed against physicians; and health careentities are required to report adverse professional reviewinformation. The Act also imposes a duty on hospitals toobtain information reported about any physician who appliesfor hospital privileges or employment, and to update suchinformation every two years after hospital privileges aregranted. 
Imperial v. Suburban Hosp. Ass'n, 37 F.3d 1026, 1028 (4th Cir. 
1994) (citations omitted). The Health Care Quality Improvement Act did not create a private right of action for persons who are the subjects of required reports. See, e.g., Held v. Decatur 
Mem'l Hosp., 16 F. Supp. 2d 975, 977 (C.D. Ill. 1998) (citing Bok v. Mut. Assurance, Inc., 119 F.3d 927, 929, reh. denied, 132 F.3d 1462 (11th Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1118, 118 S.Ct. 1796, 140 L. Ed. 2d 937 (1998), and other cases). Jones cites no case holding to the contrary, and we have found none. The circuit court correctly ruled, as a matter of law, that "there is no private cause of action available to [Jones] under" the Health Care Quality Improvement Act. 
On appeal, Jones argues that a private cause of action 
should be implied because: 
Under [Health Care Quality Improvement Act] 42 U.S.C.
§[ ]11111(a) when a professional review body meets the fourstatutory requirements prescribed in 42 U.S.C.A.§[ ]11112(a) (West 2005), it is immune from damages. 
Jones's argument lacks merit for three reasons. 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Hawai# i Supreme court has stated: 
In determining whether a private remedy is implicit in a
statute not expressly providing one, several factors arerelevant. First, is the plaintiff one of the class forwhose especial benefit the statute was enacted; that is,does the statute create a right in favor of the plaintiff? 
Flores v. Logan, 151 Hawai# i 357, 368, 513 P.3d 423, 434 (2022) 
(cleaned up). 
Doctors who are the subjects of reports to the 
National Practitioner Data Bank are not within the class of 
persons the Health Care Quality Improvement Act was enacted to benefit. See Imperial, 37 F.3d at 1028 (noting that "the Act 
establishes a national reporting system 'to follow bad doctors from place to place[.]'"). 
Second, 42 U.S.C. §§ 11111 and 11112 provide qualified 
immunity to professional review bodies "[t]o assure that hospitals and doctors cooperate with the system and engage in meaningful professional review[.]" Imperial
, 37 F.3d at 1028. 
42 U.S.C. § 11101 (1986) provides that persons participating in professional review activities that meet the standards imposed by 42 U.S.C. § 11112 "shall not be liable in damages under any law 
of the United States or of any State (or political subdivision 
thereof)" with respect to the person's participation in such 
activities. (Emphasis added.) The Health Care Quality Improvement Act provides mandated reporters with qualified immunity from liability under other federal or state laws; it 
does not create a new private cause of action. 
Third, 42 U.S.C. § 11101 does not apply to the Medical 
Board. It applies only to a "professional review body" and its 
members, staff, persons under a contract or other formal agreement with it, and persons who participate with or assist it. 
The term "professional review body" means a health care
entity and the governing body or any committee of a healthcare entity which conducts professional review activity, andincludes any committee of the medical staff of such anentity when assisting the governing body in a professionalreview activity. 
42 U.S.C. § 11151(11) (1986). 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The term "health care entity" means, in relevant part: 
(i) a hospital that is licensed to provide health care
services by the State in which it is located, 
(ii) an entity (including a health maintenance organization
or group medical practice) that provides health care
services and that follows a formal peer review process forthe purpose of furthering quality health care (as determinedunder regulations of the Secretary), and 
(iii) . . . a professional society (or committee thereof) of
physicians or other licensed health care practitioners that
follows a formal peer review process for the purpose offurthering quality health care (as determined underregulations of the Secretary). 
42 U.S.C. § 11151(4)(A) (1986). The Medical Board is not a 
"professional review body" as defined by the Health Care Quality Improvement Act. 
B. Jones's tort claims are barred by sovereign
immunity. 
By the State Tort Liability Act, Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS) Chapter 662, the State generally waived its 
sovereign immunity for the torts of its employees. HRS § 662-2 
(2016). However, the waiver does not apply to: 
Any claim arising out of assault, battery, false
imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, abuse ofprocess, libel , slander, misrepresentation, deceit, or
interference with contract rights [.] 
HRS § 662-15(4) (2016) (emphasis added). The exception also 
applies to claims for defamation. Mitsuba Publ'g Co. v. State, 
1 Haw. App. 517, 517, 620 P.2d 771, 772 (1980). 
Jones's opening brief presents no discernible argument 
that the circuit court erred by applying HRS § 662-15(4). The point is waived. Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 
Rule 28(b)(7); Hawaii Ventures, LLC v. Otaka, Inc., 114 Hawai# i 
438, 478, 164 P.3d 696, 736 (2007) ("an appellate court is not obliged to address matters for which the appellant has failed to present discernible arguments."). 
Even if an argument had been 
presented, the statutory language is clear. The circuit court 
6  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
did not err by ruling as a matter of law that Jones's claims for 
libel, defamation, and intentional interference with prospective business advantage were "barred by sovereign immunity, which is retained by [the Medical Board] under [HRS] § 662-15(4)." 
C. We need not decide whether issue preclusion
barred Jones's claims for libel and defamation. 
Jones contends that the circuit court erred by ruling 
that her libel and defamations claims were precluded by a 
judgment in a previous lawsuit.
8 The circuit court's order 
stated: 
Although the Court does not rely on this basis in issuing
its ruling , [Jones's] libel, defamation, and intentional
interference with prospective business relations claims are
also barred by collateral estoppel arising out of theoperation of the Final Judgment entered in favor ofDefendant Hawai #i Medical Board and against [Jones] in Civil
No. 10-1-2238-10 KTN. 
(Emphasis added.) As explained above, Jones's tort claims 
against the Medical Board were barred by sovereign immunity. We need not decide whether the doctrines of claim or issue preclusion also applied to those claims. 
II. The Officers' Motion 
After the circuit court entered the order granting the 
Medical Board's motion for judgment on the pleadings, the 
Officers moved for summary judgment based on Medeiros v. Kondo, 55 Haw. 499, 522 P.2d 1269 (1974). In Medeiros the supreme court declined to adopt a rule that nonjudicial government officers
9 
were absolutely immune to suits for damages arising out of the performance of their public function. Id. at 500-01, 522 P.2d at 
1270. Instead, the court adopted a rule of qualified immunity, 
8 Jones v. Hawaii Board of Medical Examiners, JIMS no. 1CC101002238. 
9 Hawai #i recognizes absolute immunity for judicial officers, State
v. Taylor, 49 Haw. 624, 631, 425 P.2d 1014, 1019 (1967), and for legislators
exercising their legislative functions, Greer v. Baker, 137 Hawai #i 249, 255,
369 P.3d 832, 838 (2016) (citing Haw. Const. art. III, § 7). 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
placing upon the "plaintiff the burden of adducing clear and 
convincing proof that defendant was motivated by malice and not by an otherwise proper purpose." Id. at 504, 522 P.2d at 1272. 
A. Constance I. Cabral. 
Cabral submitted a declaration stating: "At no time 
relevant to this case have I held any malice toward the Plaintiff Lillian M. Jones." Jones submitted no evidence to controvert Cabral's testimony. Jones offered a copy of the Medical Board's report to the National Practitioner Data Bank, but Cabral's name does not appear on the report and there is no evidence in the record about what role, if any, Cabral had in preparing or submitting the report. The circuit court did not err in granting summary judgment to Cabral. 
B. Ahlani K. Quiogue. 
Quiogue submitted a declaration stating: "At no time 
relevant to this case have I held any malice toward the Plaintiff Lillian M. Jones." The burden then shifted to Jones to "demonstrate specific facts, as opposed to general allegations, that present a genuine issue worthy of trial." Nozawa, 142 
Hawai# i at 342, 418 P.3d at 1198 (citations omitted). 
The Medical Board's report indicates that Quiogue was 
the person who transmitted it to the National Practitioner Data Bank. The report stated: 
ON SEPTEMBER 8, 2006, THE HAWAII MEDICAL BOARD (FORMERLY
KNOWN AS THE BOARD OF MEDICAL EXAMINERS) ("BOARD") DENIEDDR. JONES'S APPLICATION BASED ON HER CONDUCT AT THE PEDIATRIC CONTINUITY CARE CLINIC ON APRIL 1, 2004, THEENSUING ACTION(S) TAKEN AGAINST HER BY THE HAWAII RESIDENCYPROGRAMS, INC., TRIPLE BOARD RESIDENCY TRAINING PROGRAM, ANDTHE VIOLATIONS OF THE CONDITIONS OR LIMITATIONS UPON WHICH A LIMITED OR TEMPORARY LICENSE IS ISSUED. ON JULY 31, 2007DR. JONES SUBMITTED A REQUEST FOR RECONSIDERATION TO THEBOARD. ON AUGUST 10, 2007 THE BOARD BOARD [sic] VOTED TOAFFIRM ITS DECISION TO DENY HER APPLICATION. A HEARING WAS CONVENED ON JANUARY 23, 2008. THE HEARINGS OFFICER CONCLUDED THAT DR. JONES' ACTIONS IN THE APRIL 1, 2004INCIDENT AMOUNTED TO PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT, HAZARDOUSNEGLIGENCE, INCOMPETENCE, AND CONSTITUTED A SUFFICIENT BASISFOR THE DENIALS OF HER LICENSE APPLICATION. THE HEARINGS OFFICER RECOMMENDED THAT THE BOARD AFFIRM ITS DENIAL OF 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
DR. JONES' APPLICATION FOR A MEDICAL LICENSE. PURSUANT TO 
THE FINAL ORDER APPROVED BY THE BOARD ON AUGUST 8, 2008, THEBOARD ADOPTED THE HEARINGS OFFICER'S RECOMMENDED DECISION AS ITS FINAL ORDER AND AFFIRMED ITS DENIAL OF DR. JONES' APPLICATION FOR A MEDICAL LICENSE. 
As noted above, a plaintiff maintaining a tort claim 
against a public official who is entitled to qualified immunity 
has the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the public official "was motivated by malice and not by an otherwise proper purpose." Medeiros, 55 Haw. at 504, 522 P.2d at 
1272. Here, regardless of the propriety of the Medical Board's decision, Quiogue's submission of that decision to the National Practitioner Data Bank does not constitute evidence that Quiogue was motivated by malice. Nor is there any other evidence in the record that Quiogue was motivated by malice. Thus, the circuit court did not err in granting summary judgment to Quiogue. 
CONCLUSION 
Based upon the foregoing, the "Final Judgment in Favor 
of Defendants Hawai# i Medical Board, Ahlani K. Quiogue, EO, and 
Constance I. Cabral, EO, and Against Plaintiff Lillian M. Jones" entered by the circuit court on September 11, 2018, is affirmed.
