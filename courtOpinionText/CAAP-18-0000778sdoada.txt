In these consolidated appeals, Defendant-Appellant 
Hardy Ah Puck (Ah Puck) appeals from the Judgment; Conviction and 
Sentence; Notice of Entry (
Judgment), entered on March 1, 2018, 
in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (Circuit Court) in Case Nos. 2CPC-17-0000884 (2017 Case) and 2CPC-18-0000077 (2018 
Case).
1/ After pleading no contest pursuant to a plea agreement 
with Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai# i (State), Ah Puck was 
convicted of: (1) Promoting a Detrimental Drug in the Second 
Degree, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (
HRS) § 712-
1/ The Honorable Joseph E. Cardoza presided over both cases .  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
1248(1)(d) (2014),2/ in the 2017 Case; and (2) Promoting a Harmful 
Drug in the Fourth Degree, in violation of HRS § 712-1246.5 
(2014),3/ in the 2018 Case. 
Ah Puck raises a single point of error on appeal, 
contending that the Circuit Court plainly erred in finding that Ah Puck's no contest pleas were made knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily. 
After reviewing the record on appeal and the relevant 
legal authorities, and giving due consideration to the issues raised and the arguments advanced by the parties, we resolve Ah Puck's point of error as follows: 
I. Background 
On November 14, 2017, the State charged Ah Puck with 
four counts in the 2017 Case: (1) Count 1, promoting a controlled substance in, on, or near schools, school vehicles, public parks, or public housing projects or complexes, in violation of HRS § 712-1249.6(1)(b) (2014); (2) Count 2, promoting a detrimental drug in the second degree, in violation of HRS § 712-1248(1)(d); (3) Count 3, promoting a detrimental drug in the third degree, in violation of HRS § 712-1249(1) (2014); and (4) Count 4, prohibited acts related to drug paraphernalia, in violation of HRS § 329-43.5(a) (Supp. 2017). 
On February 2, 2018, the State charged Ah Puck with 
three counts in the 2018 Case: (1) Count 1, promoting a controlled substance in, on, or near schools, school vehicles, public parks, or public housing projects or complexes, in violation of HRS § 712-1249.6(1)(b); (2) Count 2, promoting a dangerous drug in the third degree, in violation of HRS § 712-1243(1) (2014); and (3) Count 3, prohibited acts related to drug paraphernalia, in violation of HRS § 329-43.5(a). 
2/ HRS § 712-1248 provides, in relevant part: "(1) A person commits
the offense of promoting a detrimental drug in the second degree if the person
knowingly: . . . (d) Distributes any marijuana or any Schedule V substance inany amount." (Formatting altered.) 
3/ HRS § 712-1246.5 provides, in relevant part: "(1) A person commits
the offense of promoting a harmful drug in the fourth degree if the personknowingly possesses any harmful drug in any amount." (Formatting altered.) 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
On March 1, 2018, following one day of jury selection 
and two days of trial in the 2017 case, Ah Puck and the State 
reached a plea agreement. Pursuant to the agreement, Ah Puck entered no contest pleas to: (1) Count 2 in the 2017 Case; and (2) an amended charge of promoting a harmful drug in the fourth degree in Count 2 in the 2018 Case. Trial had not yet begun in the 2018 Case. The same day, the Circuit Court held a change-of-plea hearing, accepted Ah Puck's no contest pleas, and entered the Judgment in both cases. 
II. Discussion
 Ah Puck contends that the Circuit Court failed to 
conduct an adequate colloquy to ensure that the waiver of his rights to trial and to appeal any matters that occurred prior to his change of plea were made knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily. Ah Puck argues that during the Circuit Court's plea colloquy, Ah Puck indicated having received treatment for mental illness or emotional disturbance, but the Circuit Court failed to follow up regarding the extent of the treatment and instead accepted Ah Puck's brief responses to the court's questions. 
A trial judge is constitutionally required to ensure 
that a guilty or no contest plea is made knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily. See State v. Krstoth, 138 
Hawai# i 268, 273, 378 P.3d 984, 989 (2016) (citing State v. 
Solomon, 107 Hawai# i 117, 127, 111 P.3d 12, 22 (2005)); State v. 
Hernandez, 143 Hawai# i 501, 515, 431 P.3d 1274, 1288 (2018). 
"In determining the voluntariness of a defendant's proffered
guilty plea, the trial court 'should make an affirmativeshowing by an on-the-record colloquy between the court andthe defendant wherein the defendant is shown to have a full understanding of what the plea of guilty connotes and itsconsequences.'" [Solomon, 107 Hawai #i at 127, 111 P.3d at
22] (quoting State v. Vaitogi, 59 Haw. 592, 602, 585 P.2d1259, 1265 (1978)). 
It is plain error for a trial judge to accept a
defendant's guilty plea without an affirmative showing thatit was intelligent and voluntary. Vaitogi, 59 Haw. at
601–02, 585 P.2d at 1264–65. Further, the validity of aguilty plea must be explicitly shown on the record.Vaitogi, 59 Haw. at 602, 585 P.2d at 1265. Because a guiltyplea involves the waiver of several important constitutionalrights, including the privilege against self-incrimination,the right to trial by jury, and the right to confront one'saccusers, the record must also explicitly establish a valid 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
waiver of these constitutional rights. Solomon, 107 Hawai #i 
at 127, 111 P.3d at 22. 
Krstoth, 138 Hawai# i at 273, 378 P.3d at 989; see Hernandez, 143 
Hawai# i at 513, 515, 431 P.3d at 1286, 1288. 
The validity of a waiver of a fundamental right is 
reviewed under the totality of the facts and circumstances of the 
particular case. State v. Friedman, 93 Hawai# i 63, 69, 996 P.2d 
268, 274 (2000); see State v. Ernes, 147 Hawai# i 316, 323, 465 
P.3d 763, 770 (2020) ("the issue is whether, under the totality of the circumstances surrounding the case, taking into account the defendant's background, experience, and conduct, the record reflects that the [trial] court . . . ensur[ed] that [the defendant's] jury trial waiver was voluntary, knowing, and intelligent" (quoting State v. Gomez-Lobato, 130 Hawai# i 465, 
470, 479, 312 P.3d 897, 902, 911 (2013)) (internal quotation marks omitted)). In this context, the presence of a "salient fact" in the record can create the need for a more extensive colloquy to ensure the defendant's understanding. Friedman
, 93 
Hawai# i at 69-70, 996 P.2d at 274-75. Salient facts include a 
language barrier or mental illness. See Krstoth, 138 Hawai# i at 
276, 378 P.3d at 992; State v. Han, 130 Hawai# i 83, 92, 306 P.3d 
128, 137 (2013). 
In State v. Martin, 146 Hawai# i 365, 463 P.3d 1022 
(2020), the Hawai
#i Supreme Court addressed whether the trial 
court's colloquy regarding the defendant's right to testify was deficient. Id. at 378, 463 P.3d at 1035. The defendant argued 
that the colloquy was not a "true colloquy" because the trial court recited a "litany of rights" without obtaining a response as to the defendant's understanding of the fundamental principles pertaining to his rights, and because evidence of the defendant's mental illness was a salient fact in the case. Id.
 at 379, 463 
P.3d at 1036. There, the trial court had conducted the following colloquy prior to the close of the defendant's case: 
THE COURT: Okay. So you are [the defendant]? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes. THE COURT: Okay. Are you thinking clearly? THE DEFENDANT: Yes. 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
 THE COURT: Are you presently sick? 
THE DEFENDANT: No. THE COURT: Within the past 48 hours have you taken any
pills, drugs, medication, or drank any alcohol? 
THE DEFENDANT: Um, ibuprofens. THE COURT: Okay. You're suffering from pain? THE DEFENDANT: Yes. THE COURT: Okay. Despite your pain and the medication, are
you able to think clearly now? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes. THE COURT: Okay. As I discussed with you before the start
of the trial, or at the start of the trial, you have theconstitutional right to testify in your own defense.Although you should consult with your lawyer regarding thedecision to testify, it is your decision and no one canprevent you from testifying should you choose to do so. If you decide to testify, the prosecution will be allowed tocross-examine you. You also have a constitutional right notto testify and to remain silent. If you choose not totestify, the jury will be instructed that it cannot holdyour silence against you in deciding your case. Did youunderstand what I had to say? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes. THE COURT: I have been advised by your lawyer that you do
not intend to testify in regard to this case; is this true? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes. THE COURT: And is it your decision not to testify? THE DEFENDANT: Yes, it is. 
Id. 
The supreme court held that under the totality of 
circumstances, the trial court's colloquy provided "an objective 
basis for finding that [the defendant] knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily gave up" his right to testify. Id. at 380, 463 
P.3d at 1037. With respect to the defendant's alleged mental illness, the supreme court noted that in addition to followingthe requirements of applicable case law, the trial court had "asked various questions with regard to the clarity of [the  
defendant's] state of mind at the time of the colloquy." Id. 
Similarly, here, the Circuit Court's colloquy with Ah 
Puck included various questions to ensure that Ah Puck's mind was clear when he entered his no contest plea: 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
 THE COURT: In connection with the plea agreement, it's
my understanding that you want to withdraw your previously
entered plea of not guilty to Count Two in 2CPC-17-884,Promoting a Detrimental Drug in the Second Degree, and pleadno contest. In 2CPC-18-77, you want to enter a plea of nocontest to an amended charge in Count Two of Promoting aHarmful Drug in the Fourth Degree. Do you want to enterpleas of no contest to these two charges today? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes. 
THE COURT: Okay. All right. And I am going to ask
you several questions about this decision. 
If you do not
understand any of my questions, would you please let me
know? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir. 
THE COURT: All right. Mr. Ah Puck, you are currently
49 years of age; is that correct? 
THE DEFENDANT: Correct. THE COURT: And you have completed eight years of
education; is that correct? 
THE DEFENDANT: Correct. THE COURT: Do you speak, read, write, and understand
the English language? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, I do. THE COURT: Have you ever been under treatment for any
mental illness or emotional disturbance? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes. THE COURT: The treatment that you received for the
mental illness or emotional disturbance, has that stabilized
the condition for which you were or are being treated suchthat you can think clearly and participate fully in today'sproceeding? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes. 
THE COURT: All right. 
Is your mind clear today? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes. THE COURT: Have you taken any pills, drugs, medicines
or alcoholic drinks within the last 48 hours? 
THE DEFENDANT: No. THE COURT: Are you feeling sick in any way today? THE DEFENDANT: No
. 
(Emphasis added.) In addition, Ah Puck signed a written Form K, 
6   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
i.e., change of plea form,4/ representing, among other things, the 
following: "My mind is clear. I have not taken any medication, 
alcohol, or illegal drugs within the last 48 hours. I am not sick." See State v. Pedro, 149 Hawai# i 256, ___, 488 P.3d 1235, 
1251 (2021) (though a signed Form K does not by itself render a plea constitutionally valid, it "does tend to show a plea was proper and its implications understood"). 
On the record, the Circuit Court confirmed Ah Puck's 
age, educational background, English language skills, and clear state of mind. The court's colloquy "systematically marched through each paragraph of Form K[,]" often elaborating to ensure that Ah Puck understood the consequences of his pleas. Id. The 
court explained the important constitutional rights that Ah Puck was waiving, including the right to trial by jury in each of his two cases, the rights to testify and not to testify, the right to question any witnesses who testified against him, and the right to appeal anything that had occurred prior to his change of plea. As to each constitutional right, the Circuit Court asked Ah Puck if he understood the right he was waiving. Ah Puck responded "Yes" to each of the court's questions, and confirmed that he was giving up his rights voluntarily. The court also reviewed the plea agreement's terms with Ah Puck, who indicated he understood the agreement and the consequences of his pleas. See id.
We also note that Ah Puck waived his trial rights after 
being present for one day of jury selection and two days of trial in the 2017 case. During the court's plea colloquy, the court asked Ah Puck "whether [he] want[ed] to have that trial end with a change of plea of no contest to Count Two or . . . to continue with the jury trial in that case?" Ah Puck responded, "Yes, I want to take the deal and end the trial today." When asked whether he wanted to take the plea agreement or have a jury trial in the 2018 case, Ah Puck responded, "Yeah, no jury trial." Following a thorough colloquy, the Circuit Court accepted Ah Puck's pleas. 
4/ Ah Puck confirmed during the colloquy that he signed the change of
plea form after reviewing it, including the attachment, with defense counsel.
Defense counsel certified in Form K's "Certificate of Counsel" that he had explained and reviewed the entire change of plea form with Ah Puck. 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Ah Puck argues that his "level of mental confusion" is 
displayed in various post-Judgment filings he made while self-
represented, which his current counsel characterizes as "confused and unintelligible." However, the filings themselves do not indicate that Ah Puck's no contest pleas, which were entered while Ah Puck was represented by competent counsel, were less than knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made. 
The record shows that the court engaged in a sufficient 
oral colloquy to ensure that Ah Puck's mind was clear when he entered his no contest pleas. Upon our review of the totality of the circumstances surrounding this case, taking into account Ah Puck's background, experience, and state of mind, as well as the written change of plea form (including defense counsel's certification), and the oral colloquy, we conclude that the Circuit Court did not err in determining that Ah Puck's no contest pleas were made knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily. 
For these reasons, the Judgment; Conviction and 
Sentence; Notice of Entry, entered on March 1, 2018, in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit in Case Nos. 2CPC-17-0000884 and 2CPC-18-0000077, is affirmed.
