(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that:

(2) On December 3, 2018, the family court clerk filed 
the record on appeal, and the appellate clerk notified the parties that the statement of jurisdiction and the opening brief 
were due on or before December 13, 2018, and January 14, 2019, 
respectively; 
(3) Ponce did not file either document or request an 
extension of time; 
(4) On January 31, 2019, the appellate clerk notified 
Ponce that the time for filing the statement of jurisdiction and 
opening brief had expired, the matter would be called to the NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
court's attention on February 11, 2019, for appropriate action, 
which could include dismissal of the appeal, under Hawai# i Rules 
of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rules 12.1(e) and 30, and Ponce may request relief from default by motion; and 
(5) The appellate clerk mailed the December 3, 2018 
notice of entering case on calendar and the January 31, 2019 
default notice to Ponce at the address indicated in the notice of 
appeal and record on appeal. The United States Postal Service 
returned the notices as unclaimed and unable to forward. Ponce 
has not filed a notice of change of address, as required by HRAP 
Rule 25(f), and Ponce took no further action in this appeal. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed.
