APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
KONA DISTRICT
(CASE NO. 3rc18-1-376K)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Chan, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Darryl Gama (Gama ) appeals from a
post-judgment order denying Gama's "Ex Parte Motion to Stay
Execution of Writ of Possession" (Post-Judgment Order Denying
Stay) entered on October 10, 2018, in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee
Donald Mosher ( Mosher) by the District Court of the Third
Circuit, Ka #u Division (District Court ).  On appeal, Gama
contends that the District Court erred because "it failed to
inquire into [Gama's] sworn statement that [Gama] was never
served with a copy of the SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT."1
Upon careful review of the record and briefs submitted
by the parties and having given due consideration to the

arguments and issues they raise, as well as the relevant legal
authorities, we resolve Gama's point of error as follows and
dismiss the appeal as moot.   2
On July 18, 2018, Mosher filed a complaint against,
inter alia , Gama, asserting six counts, including a claim for
ejectment and summary possession of a property which Gama had
allegedly unlawfully occupied.  On August 20, 2018, the District
Court entered its "Judgment for Possession" and "Writ of
Possession" against, inter alia , Gama, after Gama had failed to
appear at the return hearing on the summons.  No party filed a
timely appeal from the District Court's "Judgment for Possession"
or "Writ of Possession".  
On October 10, 2018, Gama filed an "Ex Parte Motion to
Stay Execution of Writ of Possession" (Post-Judgment Motion to
Stay), which the District Court subsequently denied.  Gama now
appeals from the District Court's Post-Judgment Order Denying
Stay.  3
We agree with Mosher's argument that Gama's appeal from
the Post-Judgment Order Denying Stay is moot because the "Writ of
Possession" which Gama sought to stay has expired.  The terms of
the "Writ of Possession", filed on August 20, 2018, required the
writ to be filed with the completed execution information within
180 days from the date of the writ, "unless extended by order of
[the District Court]."  The record and the files in this action
do not indicate that the District Court extended the deadline for
the "Writ of Possession", and the deadline has since passed.  4
2  Gama's Opening Brief is deficient in numerous respects under Hawai #i
Rules of Appellate Procedure ( HRAP) Rule 28(b).  However, we address Gama's
argument because Hawaii's appellate courts seek to address cases on the
merits, where possible.  See Marvin v. Pflueger, 127 Hawai #i 490, 496, 280
P.3d 88, 94 (2012).  
3  We note that Gama appears to challenge the "Judgment of Possession"
and "Writ of Possession", from which Gama failed to appeal.  We thus lack
appellate jurisdiction to address any issues related to the "Judgment of
Possession" or "Writ of Possession". 
4  The record on appeal was filed on January 4, 2019.  We further take
judicial notice of the files in the District Court, see Hawaii Rules of
Evidence Rule 201, which indicate the Writ of Possession was not extended.

Thus, Gama's appeal from the Post-Judgment Order Denying Stay is
moot.  See Wong v. Bd. of Regents, Univ. of Hawaii, 62 Haw. 391,
394, 616 P.2d 201, 203-04 (1980) (holding that the mootness
doctrine is "appropriate where events subsequent to the judgment
of the trial court have so affected the relations between the
parties that the two conditions for justiciability relevant on
appeal-adverse interest and effective remedy-have been
compromised.").  
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is
dismissed as moot.
