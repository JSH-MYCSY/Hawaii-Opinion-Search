Appellants were enrollees in managed care plans 
administered by Appellee-Respondent/Appellee United Healthcare Insurance Company, dba Evercare (Evercare).  This joint appeal
 
arises out of Appellants' respective challenges to the fees and costs they were awarded by Appellee-Appellee Gordon I. Ito, Insurance Commissioner, Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, State of Hawai# i (Commissioner), in connection with 
external review proceedings. 4 3
On appeal, Appellants contend that: (1) the Circuit 
Court erroneously applied an abuse of discretion standard of review to the Commissioner's denial of certain attorney's fees and costs under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 432E-6(e),
 
rather than a de novo standard of review; and (2) the Commissioner's interpretation and application of HRS § 432E-6(e) 5
2 The previous appeal in this case, Avilla v. Ito, No. CAAP-12-
0000646, was one of three cases in the consolidated appeal of Harrison v. Ito. 
In Harrison, we vacated the Circuit Court's dismissal of Appellants' requestfor judicial review of the Commissioner's award of attorney's fees for lack ofjurisdiction, and remanded for a decision on the merits. 2015 WL 4067205, at*4-7. 
3 Evercare administers the Quest Expanded Access Medicaid plan that
provides medically necessary covered services for aged, blind, or disabledenrollees. See Delos Santos v. Ito, No. CAAP-17-0000477, 2023 WL 2200585, at
*1 n.5 (App. Feb. 24, 2023) (mem.). Evercare now operates as UnitedHealthcareInsurance Company, Inc. Id.
4 As explained infra, the joint appeal was procedurally improper. 
5 The external review statute, HRS § 432E-6, contains an attorney's
fees and costs provision in subsection (e) allowing the insurance commissionerdiscretion to award fees and costs "in connection with the external review under this statute." This section provides: 
(e) An enrollee may be allowed, at the commissioner's
discretion, an award of a reasonable sum for attorney's feesand reasonable costs incurred in connection with the external review under this section, unless the commissionerin an administrative proceeding determines that the appealwas unreasonable, fraudulent, excessive, or frivolous. 
HRS § 432E-6(e) (2005) (repealed 2011) (emphasis added).

to deny the fees and costs at issue was inconsistent with the 
purpose and intent of the external review statute.  6 
We hold that the Circuit Court erroneously affirmed the 
Commissioner's denial of certain attorney's fees and costs, where the Commissioner did not apply the plain language of the statute, and construed the language inconsistent with the purpose and intent of the statute, which we recently set forth in Delos Santos, 2023 WL 2200585, at *10-14
. 
I. BACKGROUND 
The underlying cases share a common background, where 
each Appellant appealed Evercare's notice of a proposed reductionin covered home health services (c
overage reduction notice) 
through the external review procedure under HRS Chapter 432E. 
Evercare conducted an internal review upholding its coverage reduction decision in a "final internal determination" against 7 
6 We have restated, reorganized, and consolidated Appellants' points
of error and arguments for clarity. Appellants' Opening Brief does not comply
with Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure ( HRAP ) Rule 28. The points of error
do not indicate "where in the record" the alleged errors were raised beforethe Circuit Court. See HRAP Rule 28(b)(4)(iii) (requiring that each point
"shall state" where in the record "the alleged error was brought to theattention of the court"). The Opening Brief also contains arguments in thestatement of the case and standard of review sections that are not contained in their points of error. See HRAP Rule 28(b)(3) and (b)(5) (setting forth
requirements for the statement of the case and standards of review sections,which do not include argument). In view of the policy of deciding cases ontheir merits, we nevertheless address Appellants' arguments to the extent wecan discern them. See Marvin v. Pflueger, 127 Hawai #i 490, 496, 280 P.3d 88,
94 (2012) (internal citations, quotation marks, brackets, ellipses omitted)(addressing cases on their merits despite noncompliance with HRAP Rule 28,"where the remaining sections of the brief provide the necessary informationto identify the party's argument"). 
7 HRS Chapter 432E, entitled the "Patients' Bill of Rights and
Responsibilities Act," governs managed care plans and includes an externalreview procedure by which the enrollee may pursue a complaint against themanaged care plan, in HRS § 432E-6. "'External review' means an administrative review requested by an enrollee under section 432E-6 of amanaged care plan's final internal determination of an enrollee's complaint."HRS § 432E-1 (2005). 
HRS § 432E-6 was repealed by the 2011 Legislature, to comply with
the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. See Haw. Med. 
Serv. Ass'n v. Adams, No. CAAP-10-0000011, 2013 WL 4606314, at *1 n.2 (App.Aug. 29, 2013) (SDO); 2011 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 230, § 10 at 746. The current external review law is contained in HRS Chapter 432E, Part IV, entitled"External Determinations." See HRS §§ 432E-31-432E-44.

each Appellant.8 After each Appellant requested an external 
review9 and while such request was pending the convening of an 
external review panel, Evercare issued a May 17, 2011 letter 
cancelling its coverage reduction notice in each case.  The 
Commissioner subsequently dismissed the requests for external 
review via a June 27, 2011 Order of Dismissal (Dismissal Order) 
in each case, finding there was "no good cause to convene a 
review panel" because Evercare was no longer reducing coverage in each case. The record thus reflects that Avilla's external review was pending for over four months, from February 16, 2011 to the June 27, 2011 dismissal; Villanueva's external review request was pending for over three months, from March 16, 2011 to the June 27, 2011 dismissal; and Biddinger's external review request was pending for over three months, from March 14, 2011 to the June 27, 2011 dismissal. 
In the December 12, 2017 "Commissioner's Award of 
Attorney Fees and Costs" (Fee Award) filed in each case, the 
Commissioner awarded attorney's fees and costs to each Appellant, 
even though the external review hearing did not occur.
10 The 
Commissioner reduced attorney's fees for each Fee Award, by denying fees incurred for the time periods before the final internal determination, and after Evercare's May 17, 2011 cancellation of the coverage reduction notices. The Commissioner 
also denied expert witness costs for each Appellant. The 
pertinent background for these disallowed fees and costs follows. 
8 "Internal review" is defined as "the review under section 432E-5 
of an enrollee's complaint by a managed care plan." HRS § 432E-1. While not 
defined in Chapter 432E, a "final internal determination" is a managed careplan's determination following an internal review. See HRS § 432E-5 (2005). 
9 Avilla requested external review on February 16, 2011.  Villanueva 
requested external review on March 16, 2011.  Biddinger requested externalreview on March 14, 2011. 
10 Avilla was awarded $6,019.48 in attorney's fees and costs,
including tax, and was denied $5,849.83.  Villanueva was awarded $8,797.48 in
attorney's fees and costs, including tax, and was denied $3,858.56. Biddingerwas awarded $6,124.73 in attorney's fees and costs, including tax, and wasdenied $5,922.83. Appellants were all represented by the same counsel(Appellants' Counsel ).

 Attorney's fees incurred before the final internal
determination 
Before the final internal determination was complete, 
each Appellant consulted with Appellants' Counsel, who began 
working on their cases. Appellants' Counsel hired Wendy 
Votroubek (Nurse Votroubek), a registered nurse from Portland, 
Oregon, to perform in-home assessments for multiple clients, 
including Appellants. Nurse Votroubek visited Villanueva on Kaua# i and Avilla and Biddinger on O# ahu in March 2011; evaluated 
each Appellant's living situation in relation to their disabilities; and presented reports to Appellants' Counsel. 
In Avilla's case, Appellants' Counsel billed for work 
done from January 19, 2011 through January 27, 2011, before the February 2, 2011 final internal determination and Avilla's February 16, 2011 request for external review. 
In Villanueva's case, Appellants' Counsel billed for 
work done from February 11, 2011 through February 24, 2011, before the March 4, 2011 final internal determination and Villanueva's March 16, 2011 request for external review. 
In Biddinger's case, Appellants' Counsel billed for 
work done from February 12, 2011 through March 3, 2011, before the March 8, 2011 final internal determination and Biddinger's March 14, 2011 request for external review.
Attorney's fees incurred after Evercare's
cancellation of coverage reduction notices 
In Avilla's case, Appellants' Counsel billed for work 
done on May 18, 2011 and May 20, 2011, after Evercare's May 17, 
2011 cancellation notice, and before the Commissioner's June 27, 2011 External Review Dismissal Order. 
In Villanueva's case, Counsel billed for work done on 
May 19, 2011, after Evercare's May 17, 2011 cancellation notice, and before the Commissioner's June 27, 2011 External Review Dismissal Order. 
There was no similar billing in Biddinger's case.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Fee Awards 
Avilla's Fee Award denied attorney's fees incurred from 
January 19, 2011 to January 27, 2011, during the period before 
the February 2, 2011 final internal determination, as "not incurred as a result of the external review decision of February 2, 2011 [sic]."
11 Avilla's Fee Award denied attorney's fees for 
May 18, 2011 and May 20, 2011, during the period after Evercare's May 17, 2011 cancellation notice, as "not incurred during an active dispute." 
Villanueva's Fee Award denied attorney's fees incurred 
from February 11, 2011 through February 24, 2011, during the period before the March 4, 2011 final internal determination, as "not incurred as a result of the issuance of the external review decision of March 4, 2011 [sic]."
12 Villanueva's Fee Award 
denied attorney's fees for May 19, 2011, during the period after Evercare's May 17, 2011 cancellation notice, as "not incurred during an active dispute." 
Biddinger's Fee Award denied attorney's fees incurred 
from February 12, 2011 through March 3, 2011, during the time period before the March 8, 2011 final internal determination, as "not incurred in connection with the external review of the March 8, 2011, decision" because this time period "was prior to the issuance of a final internal determination and, thus, before an external review was triggered." 
The Commissioner also denied each Appellant's request 
for expert witness costs for identical reasons. In Avilla's and 
Villanueva's Fee Awards, the Commissioner denied expert witness 
costs because the expert witness was retained "for the external hearing which did not occur[;]" and because the assessment "was not recived [sic] by [Evercare] and was not a factor in [Evercare]'s decision to cancel its decision."  Biddinger's Fee 
11 Avilla's Fee Award erroneously refers to the February 2, 2011
final internal determination as the "external review decision[.]" 
12 Villanueva's Fee Award erroneously refers to the March 4, 2011
final internal determination as the "external review decision[.]" 
6   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Award denied expert witness costs because the expert witness was 
retained "for an external hearing which did not occur" and because the expert witness's assessment was "not presented to [Evercare] for review and consideration and were not a factor to [Evercare] canceling its final internal determination."
Appeal to Circuit Court 
Each Appellant appealed the Fee Awards to the Circuit 
Court, and the Circuit Court affirmed the Fee Awards
13 following 
an August 31, 2018 hearing. The Circuit Court's September 18, 
2018 "Order[s] Correcting and Affirming Commissioner's Award of 
Attorney Fees and Costs" found in each Award that the Commissioner "sufficiently stated his reasons" for disallowing certain attorney's fees and costs and "did not abuse his discretion in refusing to award all of the attorney's fees and costs requested by Appellant."
Joint appeal to this court 
Appellants' Counsel filed a Joint Notice of Appeal on 
October 17, 2018, citing HRAP Rule 3(b),
14 which we note was 
procedurally improper. HRAP Rule 3(b) refers to "judgment" and 
"order" in the singular form, and applies to multiple appellants jointly appealing from the same judgment or order from the same underlying case. See 16A Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, 
13 The Circuit Court corrected calculation errors in the Awards. 
The Circuit Court acknowledged that Commissioner had conceded a clerical error
in calculating the related General Excise Tax ( GET) and awarded an adjusted
GET payment to each Appellant. 
14  HRAP Rule 3(b), entitled "Joint or consolidated appeals," 
provides: 
If two or more parties are entitled to appeal from ajudgment or order and their interests are such as to makejoinder practicable, they may file a joint notice ofappeal and thereafter proceed on appeal as a singleappellant. Appeals may be consolidated by order ofeither of the Hawai #i appellate courts upon the court's
own motion, upon motion of a party, or uponstipulation of the parties to the several appeals andapproval by the court. 
(Emphasis added). 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 Federal Practice and Procedure § 3949.2 (5th ed. 2022) 
(explaining that under the parallel federal rule, "[a]ppellants entitled to appeal from the same judgment or order may join their appeals by filing a joint notice of appeal."). 
Here, the record reflects that the parties filed a 
stipulation for consolidation in the prior appeal, Harrison v. Ito. Following remand, however, the cases proceeded unconsolidated under three civil case numbers.  The Circuit Court 
issued separate orders and judgments in each case, and 
thereafter, three separate appeals should have been filed, with consolidation by motion or stipulation by the parties and upon approval by this court. See HRAP Rule 3(b). Despite this 
procedural flaw, the joint appeal was timely as to each judgment issued by the Circuit Court, and we have appellate jurisdiction. Further, as there was no opposition to the joint appeal, and because the parties briefed the case as if the cases were consolidated, we consider Appellants' joint appeal on the merits. See Mark v. Mark, 9 Haw. App. 184, 186, 828 P.2d 1291, 1293 (1992) (recognizing that although two cases were improperly consolidated by stipulation of the parties under HRAP Rule 3(b) by the trial court, because the cases were briefed as if they were consolidated, the appellate court would decide both appeals). 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A. Secondary Appeals 
Review of a decision made by the circuit court upon
its review of an agency's decision is a secondary appeal.
The standard of review is one in which [the appellate] courtmust determine whether the circuit court was right or wrongin its decision, applying the standards set forth in HRS§ 91-14(g) (1993) to the agency's decision. 
HRS § 91-14, entitled "Judicial review of contested
cases," provides in relevant part: 
(g) Upon review of the record the court may affirm
the decision of the agency or remand the case withinstructions for further proceedings; or it mayreverse or modify the decision and order if thesubstantial rights of the petitioners may have beenprejudiced because the administrative findings,conclusions, decisions, or orders are: 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(1) In violation of constitutional or statutory
provisions; or 
(2) In excess of the statutory authority or
jurisdiction of the agency; or 
(3) Made upon unlawful procedure; or 
(4) Affected by other error of law; or (5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,
probative, and substantial evidence on the
whole record; or 
(6) Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized
by abuse of discretion or clearlyunwarranted exercise of discretion. 
Under HRS § 91-14(g), conclusions of law arereviewable under subsections (1), (2), and (4);questions regarding procedural defects undersubsection (3); findings of fact under subsection (5);and an agency's exercise of discretion undersubsection (6).

(quoting Paul's Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Befitel, 104 Hawai# i 412, 
416, 91 P.3d 494, 498 (2004)).
B. Conclusions of Law 
"Pursuant to HRS § 91-14(g), an agency's conclusions of 
law are reviewed de novo." Id. (citation omitted). "A circuit 
court's conclusions of law are subject to de novo review." Paul's Elec. Serv., 104 Hawai# i at 420, 91 P.3d at 502 (citation 
omitted). 
C. Statutory Interpretation 
"Statutory interpretation is a question of law 
reviewable de novo." Stout v. Bd. of Trs. of the Emps.' Ret. 
Sys., 140 Hawai# i 177, 185, 398 P.3d 766, 774 (2017) (citing 
Citizens Against Reckless Dev. v. Zoning Bd. of Appeals, 114 Hawai# i 184, 193, 159 P.3d 143, 152 (2007)). 
First, the fundamental starting point for statutory
interpretation is the language of the statute itself.Second, where the statutory language is plain andunambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plainand obvious meaning. Third, implicit in the task ofstatutory construction is our foremost obligation toascertain and give effect to the intention of thelegislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 language contained in the statute itself. Fourth, when
there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or indistinctivenessor uncertainty of an expression used in a statute, anambiguity exists. 
When there is ambiguity in a statute, the meaning of the
ambiguous words may be sought by examining the context, withwhich the ambiguous words, phrases, and sentences may becompared, in order to ascertain their true meaning.Moreover, the courts may resort to extrinsic aids indetermining legislative intent, such as legislative history,or the reason and spirit of the law. 
Id. (quoting Citizens Against Reckless Dev., 114 Hawai# i at 
193-94, 159 P.3d at 152-53).
III. DISCUSSION 
A. Under the circumstances of this case, a de novo standard of review applies rather thanabuse of discretion to the Commissioner's denials of the fees and costs at issue. 
Appellants argue that de novo review under HRS § 
91-14(a)(1), (2) and (4) was required, because "the Commissioner 
made errors of law in deciding to disallow reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable costs" that Appellants incurred in their respective external reviews.  Appellants also claim the Circuit 
Court "erroneously applie[d] the abuse of discretion standard" 
when it affirmed the Commissioner's "refus[al] to award all of the attorney's fees and costs requested by Appellant[s]." Appellants argue that the Commissioner's denial of the attorney's fees and costs at issue was dependent on the Commissioner's erroneous interpretations of HRS § 432E-6(e), which necessitate de novo review. 
Appellants' argument regarding the standard of review 
is similar to what was presented in Delos Santos. We held there that a de novo standard of review applied to the Commissioner's 
decisions interpretating and applying HRS § 432E-6(e). 2023 WL 2200585, at *7-8. We explained that: 
[T]he Commissioner's specific denials of the attorney's fees
and expert costs at issue did not involve the discretionaryareas identified in the statute, i.e. whether to award feesand costs or not, or what sum would be reasonable. Rather,the Commissioner interpreted the statutory language, "inconnection with the external review under this statute," todetermine whether attorney's fees incurred during a 
10 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
  
 
  particular time frame were within the scope of the statute.
With respect to expert witness fees, the Commissioner alsointerpreted the statute to determine whether specific costssuch as expert witness fees were permissible under thestatute. Because these are conclusions of law interpreting
and applying HRS § 432E-6(e), we apply a de novo, 
right/wrong standard of review. 
Id. at *8 (citations omitted). 
Here, the Commissioner interpreted the statutory 
language "incurred in connection with the external review" to 
deny attorney's fees because they were incurred during particular time frames that the Commissioner deemed were not in connection to the external review. The Commissioner also interpreted HRS § 
432E-6(e) to deny expert witness costs.  Thus, the Commissioner 
interpreted and applied HRS § 432E-6(e), and drew conclusions of 
law, for which a de novo, right/wrong standard of review applies. See id.; Stout, 140 Hawai# i at 185, 398 P.3d at 774; United Pub. 
Workers, 106 Hawai# i at 363, 105 P.3d at 240. 
B. The Commissioner's interpretation and
application of HRS § 432E-6(e) to deny thefees and costs at issue were erroneous. 
Appellants argue, inter alia, that each Fee Award 
"[c]ontravenes the [m]anifest [p]urposes of HRS § 432E-6(e)" and 
that "[i]n construing the term 'in connection with the external review,['] the Commissioner was required to correctly ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature." Applying 
the analysis we recently set forth in Delos Santos, the 
Commissioner's grounds for denial of the fees and costs at issue did not follow the plain language of HRS § 432E-6(e), and was inconsistent with the purpose and intent of the external review statute. 
1. The Commissioner's grounds for denial of
attorney's fees incurred prior to thefinal internal determination were erroneous. 
Avilla's and Villanueva's Fee Awards denied attorney's 
fees incurred prior to the final internal determination as "not 
incurred as a result of the external review decision[.]" (Emphasis added). The Biddinger Fee Award denied fees for this 
11 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
time period because the fees were incurred "before an external 
review was triggered." (Emphases added). 
In Delos Santos, we explained that the plain language 
of "in connection with" is broad –- without temporal, or time-specific limitations: 
HRS § 432E-6(e) does not use temporal, or time-specific
language such as " during  the external review," but uses
broader language, "in connection with[.]" Merriam-Webster defines "in connection with" as "in relation to (something)." Thus, the phrase "in connection with" --means the attorney's fees incurred "in relation to" theexternal review, without any temporal or time-specificlanguage like the word "during." 
Delos Santos, 2023 WL 2200585, at *9 (citations omitted). 
Here, as in Delos Santos, Appellants' Counsel's work 
prior to the final internal determination was in connection with, 
and related to, the same issue in the subsequent external review -- Evercare's attempt to reduce covered services for each Appellant. The statute authorizes fees incurred "in connection with" an external review –- not "as a result of" an external review, and not dependent on when external review "was triggered." The Commissioner's justifications to deny attorney's fees did not apply the plain language of HRS § 432E-6(e) and were erroneous. 
As we explained in Delos Santos, a broad interpretation 
of "in connection with" is also consistent with the liberal construction that we must afford to a remedial statute like HRS § 432E-6(e). Id. at *9-10. Such an interpretation is also 
consistent with the purpose and intent of the external review statute, to assist patients of managed care plans like Appellants, and to afford them rights and protections.
15 Id. at 
15 In Delos Santos, we examined the legislative history and purpose
of the external review statute, and explained that: 
[T]he Legislature's purpose for enacting the external review
statute, HRS § 432E-6, was to assist patients of managedcare plans and to afford them rights and protections. The external review procedure in HRS § 432E-6 provided aprocedural remedy in the form of a review hearing, and
(continued...) 
12 15(...continued)NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
*10-11. We conclude that, under a de novo review, the 
Commissioner's grounds for denying attorney's fees in each Fee Award incurred prior to the final internal determination were erroneous. See United Pub. Workers, 106 Hawai# i at 363, 105 P.3d 
at 240. 
2. The Commissioner's grounds for denial of
attorney's fees incurred afterEvercare's cancellation of the coveragereduction notices were erroneous. 
Avilla's and Villanueva's Fee Awards denied attorney's 
fees incurred after Evercare's cancellation notices because the 
fees "were not incurred during an active dispute." This justification to deny attorney's fees did not apply the plain language of HRS § 432E-6(e), which authorizes attorney's fees "in connection with the external review" –- and not contingent upon "an active dispute." The billing entries in question for May 18, 19 and 20, 2011 were related to, and in connection with the external reviews for Avilla and Villanueva, which were still pending and not dismissed until the June 27, 2011 Dismissal Order. The denial of the attorney's fees incurred after the cancellation notice was erroneous given the grounds relied upon by the Commissioner. See id.
served to strengthen the consumer rights of patients, to
enforce a patient's rights against unreasonable adversedeterminations regarding health care coverage, and toprotect the health and safety of the patient while cost-reducing measures were implemented by managed care plans.The award of reasonable attorney's fees and costs for anenrollee who mounted a challenge to a managed care plan'sdecision through an external review, is remedial because itfacilitates the enforcement of patients' rights through theexternal review procedure. 
The statutory provision allowing
an award of reasonable attorney's fees and costs to anenrollee promotes the redress of injuries for enrollees whoincur attorney's fees and costs for an external review. 
2023 WL 2200585, at *11 (citations omitted). 
13 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
      3. The Commissioner's denial of expert
witness costs on grounds that theexternal review hearing did not occurwas erroneous. 
All of the Fee Awards denied expert witness fees 
because the external review hearing "did not occur[;]" the expert 
witness did not appear or testify; the expert's assessment was not provided to Evercare; and the expert's assessment was "not a factor" in Evercare's cancellation notices. These grounds for denying the expert witness costs are erroneous because they do not apply the plain language of the statute – allowing costs incurred "in connection with the external review[.]" HRS § 432E-6(e). The expert witness costs were clearly related to the external review, as the expert's assessment was Appellants' attempt to meet their burden of proof at the external review hearing to show that Evercare's decision to reduce covered services was unreasonable. See Delos Santos, 2023 WL 2200585, at 
*15-16 (rejecting the categorical exclusion of expert witness fees as costs in view of a conflict of laws provision in HRS Chapter 432E, and the burden of proof placed upon the enrollee to demonstrate that the managed care plan's proposed reduction of services was unreasonable and that the existing level of services was medically necessary). To the extent the language "in connection with the external review" is ambiguous as applied here, where an external review hearing never occurred, HRS § 432E-6(e) must be liberally construed in light of its remedial purpose and consistent with legislative intent. See id. at *10. 
Thus, we conclude that the Commissioner's grounds for denying expert witness costs under the circumstances of this case were wrong. See United Pub. Workers, 106 Hawai# i at 363, 105 P.3d at 
240.
