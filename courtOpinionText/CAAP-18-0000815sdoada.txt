CHRISTOPHER L. BUTLER, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
HAMAKUA DIVISION 
(CASE NO. 3DCW-18-0002360) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Christopher L. Butler (Butler) 
appeals from the Judgment and Notice of Entry of Judgment 
(Judgment), entered by the District Court of the Third Circuit, 
Hamakua Division (District Court)  on September 20, 2018. The 
District Court convicted Butler of Harassment, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 711-1106(1)(b) (2014).

1 The Honorable Mahilani Hiatt presided. 
2 HRS § 711-1106(1)(b) states: 
§ 711-1106 Harassment. 
(1) A person commits the offense of harassment if, with
intent to harass, annoy, or alarm any other person, that
person: 
. . . 
(b) Insults, taunts, or challenges another person
in a manner likely to provoke an immediate violent NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On appeal, Butler argues that (1) there was 
insufficient evidence to convict him, and (2) the District Court 
applied the incorrect state of mind requirement under HRS § 711-
1106(1)(b). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we 
resolve Butler's point of error as follows: 
(1) When the evidence adduced at trial is considered 
in the strongest light for the prosecution, State v. Matavale
, 
115 Hawai# i 149, 157–58, 166 P.3d 322, 330–31 (2007) (
Matavale), 
there was sufficient evidence to support Butler's conviction for 
Harassment. Based on the complaining witness's testimony, which 
the District Court found to be credible, it appears Butler 
insulted, taunted, or challenged the complaining witness in a 
manner that would cause the complaining witness to reasonably 
believe that Butler intended to cause bodily injury to others or 
property damage. After the complaining witness and another 
worker informed Butler that the senior citizen center was closed, 
the complaining witness escorted Butler out, at which time Butler 
turned and said, "You keep being closed like this you'll get 
shot."3 The complaining witness testified that she was shaken by 
the incident and concerned about the safety of senior citizens whom the center serves. 
In criminal cases, "proof of circumstantial evidence 
and reasonable inferences arising from circumstances surrounding 
the act is sufficient to establish the requisite intent. Thus, 
the mind of an alleged offender may be read from his acts, 
conduct, and inferences fairly drawn from all of the 
response or that would cause the other person to
reasonably believe that the actor intends to cause bodilyinjury to the recipient or another or damage to theproperty of the recipient or another[.] 
3 The other worker at the senior center also testified that she 
overheard Butler's statement.

circumstances." State v. Calaycay , 145 Hawai# i 186, 200, 449 
P.3d 1184, 1198 (2019) (citation omitted). When viewed in the 
light most favorable to the prosecution, 
Matavale
, 115 Hawai# i at 
157–58, 166 P.3d at 330–31, the evidence adduced at trial supports the inference that Butler acted with the "intent to 
harass, annoy, or alarm" the complaining witness. HRS § 711
-
1106(1). As such, we hold there was sufficient evidence to support Butler's conviction. 
(2) However, it appears the District Court applied the
wrong state of mind test to Butler's Harassment conviction. The 
express mens rea requirement of HRS § 711-1106(1)(b) is the 
"intent to harass, annoy, or alarm any other person[.]" In 
stating its findings, the District Court commented, in relevant 
part:  
Um, I agree that a statement like that, uh, is
intended to, uh, if not to taunt, certainly to challenge,
and that's how the Court finds that, uh, that statement wasmade. I -- I -- I don't think just saying "you're -- you're
gonna be shot", uh, I don't think you need to say, "I'mgoing to shoot you" or "the neighbor's going to shoot you",uh, in order for the statement to then cause a reasonably be-- have the person reasonably believe that there's going tobe, uh, some type of damage or bodily injury. 
So with respect to, uh, the 711-1106(b), the Court
does, uh, find you guilty, sir. 
(Emphasis added.) 
The District Court's reference that Butler's statement 
was "intended to" taunt or challenge misstates the statute's mens 
rea requirement. While the prohibited conduct under the statute 
includes "insults, taunts, or challenges," such conduct must also 
be made with the "intent to harass, annoy or alarm." HRS § 711-
1106(1)(b). The record does not contain any further statements 
otherwise indicating that the District Court applied the correct 
statutory mens rea requirement.  It thus appears the District 
Court misapplied the law in assessing Butler's state of mind. 
As the District Court did not make any definitive 
finding that Butler did not act with the necessary mens rea, and because there was sufficient evidence at trial to sustain the

charge, the appropriate remedy is a new trial. See State v. 
Pesentheiner, 95 Hawai# i 290, 301, 22 P.3d 86, 97 (App. 2001). 
Therefore,  
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment entered by the 
District Court on September 20, 2018 is vacated and the case is remanded for a new trial.
