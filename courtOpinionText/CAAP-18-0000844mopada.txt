 Entry of [June 26, 2017] Default and [July 24, 2017] Default 
Judgment."1  (Some brackets in original.) 
I. BACKGROUND 
  DK and Plaintiff-Appellee JK were married in 1995 and 
had two children together, born in 1997 and 2000.  After twenty-one years of marriage, JK filed a Complaint for Divorce (Complaint) on October 20, 2016.  In the Complaint, JK indicated that he was a musician, both self-employed and employed at "U.H. Maui College" and DK was "Owner/Employee" of Edible Hawaiian 
Islands Magazine.  He stated that the marriage was irretrievably 
broken, and sought just and equitable division of assets and debts, joint legal and physical custody of their minor child, and no spousal support.   Represented by counsel, DK answered the Complaint, challenging JK's position on joint physical custody and no spousal support. A. First Request For Financial Documents 
  On January 24, 2017, JK served on DK his "First 
Request for Production of Documents," which requested financial information including information related to her business, Edible Hawaiian Islands Magazine.  The deadline for her response was February 23, 2017, but DK did not respond.  JK's counsel

 phoned DK's counsel regarding the status of the past-due 
financial information, and DK's counsel stated "simply that she 
was withdrawing as [DK's] attorney." B. Motion To Withdraw As DK's Counsel   Six days after the deadline to respond, DK's counsel moved to withdraw as counsel, declaring that DK "has not complied with the terms of our Retainer Agreement and several subsequent discussions regarding communication with Counsel and complying with deadlines."  (Emphasis added.)  DK's counsel 
served the motion to DK's P.O. Box 849 address.  JK did not oppose the motion to withdraw as counsel but requested that DK provide "her mailing and physical address" and apprise them of any changes to that information.   On March 9, 2017, the parties, including DK, were present for the hearing on the motion to withdraw, which was granted.  DK provided her mailing address as the P.O. Box 849 address. 
C. Second Request For Financial Information  
  On March 18, 2017, JK's counsel called DK regarding the request for financial information, and DK "indicated she would have to consult with her accountant" and would call back on March 20, 2017.  With no response from DK, JK's attorney emailed on April 6, 2017 informing DK that if her response to the request for financial information was not provided by NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 April 11, 2017, they "will have no alternative but to file a 
motion to compel" and that "[n]ormally a [] motion to compel 
will include a request for attorney's fees and costs."   The day after the deadline to respond, on April 12, 2017, DK emailed JK's attorney indicating that the tax firm she hired informed her on April 8, 2017 that it could not represent either DK or JK because the "firm made an error and should of [sic] not taken [JK] on as a client" and she needs to find a new CPA.  DK also indicated that she was "still looking for a new 
attorney" and the attorneys on Maui "declined to represent [her] 
due to conflict of interest.  So [she has] moved [her] search to 
[O‘ahu]." 
D. Motion To Compel Discovery And May 31, 2017 Hearing 
  On May 4, 2017, JK moved to compel DK to respond to the request for financial documents, and for attorney's fees and 
costs related to the motion to compel.  Attached to the motion 
was correspondence between JK's attorney and DK, and JK's first request for production of documents.  The notice was served to the P.O. Box 849 address on May 2, 2017, and stated that the hearing was scheduled for May 31, 2017 at 10:00 a.m.   On May 31, 2017, three calls for DK were made, and there was no response.  The family court granted JK's motion to compel and for attorneys' fees and costs "due to [DK's] failure 
to appear," and stated, "[DK] is defaulted."  The family court NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
 
 
5 
 ordered DK to respond to discovery no later than June 13, 2017, 
with a hearing scheduled for June 27, 2017, and noted that "if 
[DK] fails to respond and fails to appear on June 27, 2017 at 1:30 p.m., the court may grant the proposed divorce decree that will be attached to the court order."  (Formatting altered.)   However, that order was not served in a timely manner, resulting in a motion to extend these June 2017 dates.    E. Documents Served On June 27, 2017  1. First set of documents, filed June 26, 2017 
 
a. JK's motion to extend deadlines (page 1)
2 
   On June 26, 2017, JK filed an "Ex Parte Motion to 
Extend Deadlines and to Continue Status Hearing" (Motion to Extend Deadlines) moving the family court "for an order 
extending the deadlines in this matter and continuing the status 
hearing currently set for June 27, 2017 at 1:30 p.m. in 
Courtroom 3A."  (Formatting altered and emphasis added.)  The motion explains that "[t]he grounds for this Motion are that 
[DK] has not been served with the Order relating to the Motion 
to Compel Discovery filed May 5, 2017 and heard on May 31, 2017."  (Emphasis added.)

  b. Counsel's declaration (pages 3-4) 
 
 In her declaration attached to the motion, JK's 
counsel explained that DK failed to appear at the May 31, 2017 
hearing, and default was entered against her.   The declaration also reiterated the June 2017 deadlines:  (1) DK was ordered to respond to discovery requests no later than June 13, 2017; (2) the family court set further hearing for June 27, 2017, and "the Court may grant a proposed Divorce Decree"; and (3) a status update was due by June 20, 
2017. 
  JK's counsel then explained that she "drafted the Order of the hearing held May 31, 2017, but has not provided a copy to" DK.  Thus, she "is requesting this Honorable Court to extend the deadlines imposed on [DK] and to continue the current status hearing to a later date." 
c. "Ex Parte Order" (pages 5-6) 
  Following the Motion to Extend Deadlines and the 
counsel's declaration was the "Ex Parte Order" that granted JK's 
Motion to Extend Deadlines and set forth new dates: NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

As shown in Paragraph Number 2 above, the order states that "[t]he Status Hearing currently set for June 27, 2017 at 1:30 
p.m. is hereby continued to be heard before the Honorable 
Presiding Judge of the Family Court, Second Circuit, State of 
Hawaii, on "Jul 20 2017" at 10:00 a.m. . . ."  (Emphasis added.)   
As shown in Paragraph Number 3, the deadline to respond to the request for financial information was July 10, 2017.   The July 10th dates are handwritten in blue ink, and the July 20th date is stamped.  And as shown in Paragraph Number 6, the order stated that should DK fail to appear at the 
hearing or respond to the discovery request, the court may grant Record on Appeal, docket 11, pages 74 -75

 the "proposed Divorce Decree submitted and filed by Plaintiff."   
This order was dated June 26, 2017 and signed by the judge. 
 2. Second set of documents, filed June 26, 2017 
 
a. Order of hearing held May 31, 2017 (pages 7-8) 
   The second set of documents started with the "Order of 
the Hearing Held May 31, 2017 on Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Discovery and For Attorney's Fees and Costs Filed May 4, 2017," which showed that three calls were made at the hearing on May 31, 2017, but DK failed to appear.  This order then found DK 
"is hereby in default for her failure to appear herein."   
  This order also set forth the following June 2017 dates:  (1) the response to the discovery request was due by June 13, 2017; (2) status update, "which shall consist of a proposed Divorce Decree," was due by June 20, 2017; and (3) the hearing was set for June 27, 2017, and "the Court may grant a proposed Divorce Decree submitted to the Court by Plaintiff which is attached as Exhibit 'B.'" 
  This order was signed by the judge, filed on June 26, 
2017, and served on June 27, 2017. 
  b. Exhibit B - "Judgment Granting Divorce And   
   Awarding Child Custody" (pages 10-19) 
 
  Exhibit B, JK's proposed "Judgment Granting Divorce 
and Awarding Child Custody" (Proposed Judgment), addressed the 
terms of the divorce, including division of property.  The Proposed Judgment indicated that the "parties have no joint NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 credit union accounts, bank and savings accounts and security 
accounts" and set forth that "[e]ach party is awarded any and 
all credit union accounts, bank and savings accounts and security accounts presently in his or her own name as their sole and separate property."   For DK's business, the Proposed Judgment set forth that DK "shall be awarded any and all businesses in her name, including, but not limited to, the magazine called Edible Hawaiian Islands, as her sole and separate property and shall be 
solely responsible for any and all debts and tax consequences 
relating to her business or businesses."      For the real property, the Proposed Judgment set forth that JK "shall be awarded the real property . . . as his sole and separate property and he shall be solely responsible for any and all debts, expenses and costs relating to said property."  3. Certificate of service, filed June 27, 2017 (page 20)   The certificate of service certified that "the Ex 
Parte Motion to Extend Deadlines and to Continue Status hearing; 
Exhibit 'A'; Declaration of Counsel; Ex Parte Order filed June 26, 2017" and "the Order of the Hearing Held May 31, 2017 on Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Discovery and for Attorney's Fees and Costs filed May 4, 2017; Exhibits 'A' and 'B' filed June 26, 2017" were served on DK.  The address on the certificate of service was the P.O. Box 849 address DK provided NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

  to the family court, and the certificate of service was dated 
for, and filed on, June 27, 2017. 
F. July 20, 2017 Hearing   At the July 20, 2017 further hearing on the motion to compel, three calls were made for DK and there was no response.    Before proceeding, the family court reexamined the documents served on DK: 
 [Family Court:]  The time is now 10:33.  This was 
scheduled for hearing at 10:30. 
 
 There is an order of the hearing held on May 31st on 
plaintiff's motion to compel discovery and for attorney's 
fees and costs that was filed (inaudible) 4th.   Attached to it [as] Exhibit A was the form or the 
method for attorney's fees by declaration to be presented 
to the Court.  And attached as Exhibit B was the 
plaintiff's proposed judgment granting divorce and awarded -- awarding child custody. 
  Here is the certificate of service indicating that 
that order was served with those two attached exhibits on [DK] on June 26, 2017.   [JK's Counsel:]  She's served on the 27th. 
 
 [Family Court:]  And the prior order did provide that 
if she failed to appear today that the Court specifically 
said it would be -- if defendant fails -- failed to appear 
-- respond to the discovery request, and fails to appear at 
the hearing of June 27th, 2017, the Court may grant proposed divorce decree submitted to the Court. 
  [JK's Counsel:]  And we filed that with the Court on 
the 26th and attached the order for hearing on May 31st.  
 [Family Court:]  So, but today's the -- what happened 
to the June 27th hearing?  That was stricken and 
rescheduled?   [JK's Counsel:]  Got continued because she was not 
served with the order and didn't have time to respond.   [Family Court:]  Did she get notice of today's 
hearing? NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
 
 
11 
  [JK's Counsel:]  Yes.  On June 27th we -- we sent -- 
we filed a certificate of service saying on the certificate 
of service she got a copy of the order and the ex parte motion to extend the deadlines and to continue.   
 
 [Family Court:]  (Inaudible) status hearing.  Ah, the 
ex parte motion to extend deadlines and continue the status hearing, I just want to look at that.   
 
 [JK's Counsel:]  And that was filed on June 26th. 
 
 [Family Court:]  Thank you.  And the ex parte order 
sets new deadlines.  Defendant to respond to discovery request on or before July 10th.  And setting the status 
hearing on today's date, July 20th, at 10:00 a.m.  
   And that ex parte order further provides that if 
defendant fails to appear at the status hearing mentioned above or fails to respond to the discovery request by the 
deadlines stated herein, the Court may grant the proposed 
divorce decree submitted and filed by plaintiff.   . . . .
 
 
 [JK's Counsel:]  --
 we filed it on June 26th with the 
order. 
  [Family Court:]  And has there been any communication 
from the defendant? 
  [JK's Counsel:]  Nothing, your Honor.  I know that 
she -- although she's been in communication with my client 
about other things, a bill, she has not discussed the discovery or this divorce case with him. 
 
 [Family Court:]  So a default is entered against 
[DK].   Would you like your client sworn in today regarding 
jurisdiction or do you want to submit it by affidavit?  
  After hearing JK's testimony, the family court 
determined it had jurisdiction over this matter, and found that 
the marriage was irretrievably broken.  The family court then 
noted that it "previously entered default against [DK] for having failed to appear today and to -- and failing to comply with discovery requests."  The family court "grant[ed] the NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
 
 
12 
  decree of divorce that was filed as a proposed decree on 
June 26th, 2017." 
  The family court then turned to the division of assets.  Regarding the real property, JK's Counsel explained that JK "owned the house prior to the marriage.  And so his wife's interest would be any equity, increase in the equity."  JK's Counsel also explained that DK "owns a business which my client has indicated that has substantial cash flow.  Um, probably 100,000 a year in cash flow.  Right?  After -- after 
her expenses are paid.  Maybe before taxes."  She estimated, 
"the value of her -- as close as I could estimate, the value of her business, um, would be equal to or close to the increase in the value of the house that he owned -- or owns."  "And so for that reason, we drafted the divorce decree the way we drafted it."   The family court then questioned JK under oath about the division of real property and whether it was reasonably 
fair: 
 [Family Court:]  So -- so let me ask you.  Do you 
think that how everything is divided up in the divorce 
decree, is it reasonably fair?   [JK:]  I -- I do.  I mean I understand that [DK] is 
entitled to half the increase in equity of the house.  And we had an informal agreement when we were married that she 
had no interest in the property.  Although I offered her, you know, sharing the title.  And I paid for everything with the house for the en -- our entire marriage.  All 
taxes, all mortgage, all repairs and maintenance. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
 
 
13 
  [Family Court:]  Is -- is the value of her business, 
in your opinion, reasonably close to the value of the 
increase in equity, if divided by two, during the marriage?    
 [JK:]  I think it's close.  But I --  
 
 [Family Court:]  All right.  I'm satisfied. 
  [JK's Counsel:]  Your Honor, there is one, um error I 
think I made that is manifestly unjust to [DK].  And that is in the proposed decree I have a paragraph in there that says undisclosed assets and if she doesn't disclose -- anybody failed to disclose it, so that the other party 
would be awarded it. 
 
 Since we're going by default and she hasn't disclosed 
anything that -- that would ostensibly mean he gets 
everything that she owns.  And I don't think that that's fair to her. 
 
 So I'd like to delete that paragraph. 
  [Family Court:]  Okay.  You'll strike that paragraph.  
As well as there's a paragraph that states that this decree 
is by agreement. 
 
  On July 24, 2017, the "Judgment Granting Divorce and 
Awarding Child Custody" was entered, finding that DK failed to 
appear and "default is entered against her."  The family court 
awarded JK the real property and DK "any and all businesses in her name, including, but not limited to, the magazine called Edible Hawaiian Islands, as her sole and separate property[.]"   The family court also retained "jurisdiction over the parties and their property to enforce and implement the provisions of this Judgment" and "enforcement jurisdiction of all of the above issues until the parties have complied fully 
with the terms and conditions as set forth herein."  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
 
 
14 
    Based on the July 25, 2017 Certificate of Service, two 
certified copies of the judgment were served on DK at the P.O. 
Box 849 address she provided to the court. G. 
DK's Motion To Set Aside 
 1. Motion to set aside   Almost one year later, on June 29, 2018, DK filed her "Motion to Set Aside Entry of Default and Default Judgment" 
(Motion to Set Aside).  DK based this motion on Hawai‘ i Rules of 
Civil Procedure (
HRCP) Rules "60(b)(1) (mistake, inadvertence, 
surprise, or excusable neglect)" and "60(b)(3) (fraud, 
misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party)."    
Attached to her Motion to Set Aside was DK's 
declaration, where she stated that the "hearing was continued by [JK's] attorney Ex Parte -- i.e., without notice to me."  She also stated that "[t]o add to the confusion, when [JK's] attorney finally did serve the May 31 order, she did so at the same time as an Ex Parte Order filed June 26, 2017 with the result that, at a time when I was unrepresented, I was served simultaneously with confusing and conflicting notices."
 
  Also attached to DK's Motion to Set Aside were the 
following exhibits:

2.   JK's Memorandum in Opposition  
  On July 13, 2018, JK opposed DK's Motion to Set Aside.   
In the declaration attached to his opposition, JK stated that DK 
has several businesses he is aware of, namely, Edible Hawaiian Islands Magazine, Edible Events, Duka Inc., and Kupu Maui; and he understood from DK that the magazine was making a $90,000 profit under previous ownership and the magazine was appraised at $90,000.  JK stated that checks he sent to her, and she cashed, were sent to the same P.O. Box 849 address as the court filings, and this is also the address she received checks from 
her advertisers.  JK attached twenty-eight exhibits with his 
response. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

  3. DK's Memorandum in Reply 
  On July 25, 2018, DK replied to JK's opposition, 
raising for the first time Hawai‘ i Family Court Rules (HFCR) 
Rule 60(b)(4) (judgment void).  
 Attached to the reply were declarations from DK and 
her attorney.  DK's declaration included statements that 
"conflicting notices, which I received in the same envelope, were confusing to me and I did not have an attorney to help me figure out how to interpret them" and "the only active business I own, [is] Edible Hawaiian Islands Magazine."  
 Also attached 
were the following exhibits: 
A. a revised Asset and Debt Statement dated July 25, 
2018, which now included Edible Hawaiian Islands 
Magazine valued at $60,000 and debt owed against 
the magazine at $34,000; and

stating, "No Holdings found for this client[.]" 
 
4. JK's Responsive Memorandum 
 
  On August 1, 2018, JK filed a responsive memorandum 
and declaration with the following exhibits:  
A. screen shot and email regarding taxes; and  
 
B. a letter from DK in Edible Hawaiian Islands 
Magazine announcing the launch of a new business, 
Lawelawe Hawaii, published "Summer 2018[.]"3

    In a supplemental declaration filed the next day, JK 
stated, "I did not realize the scope of how much money I forgave 
that [DK] had taken from my Seaside Recording checking account and credit card and diverted it to her own business expenses.  This would surely be in the six-figure range."  JK also declared that "[i]f the default was set aside it could require me to re-negotiate finances and property with [DK]."  5. Hearing and order     On August 6, 2018, a hearing was held on DK's Motion 
to Set Aside Default.  According to the court minutes, the  
hearing lasted one hour and twenty-three minutes, from 10:14 a.m. to 11:37 a.m.
4 
  The family court entered an order denying DK's motion on September 5, 2018, determining that:  (1) as related to HFCR Rule 60(b)(3), there was "no evidence of intrinsic fraud or judgment procured by fraud in this matter;" (2) as related to HFCR Rule 60(b)(4), there was "no due process violation [that] 
occurred in this matter;" and (3) "the sanction of default was 
within the sound discretion of the Court."   
                                                            
 4  DK, however, did not provide this court with the transcripts for this 
proceeding.  It is DK's burden to show error by reference to the record, and 
DK is responsible for providing the transcript of relevant oral proceedings.

   H. DK's Motion To Reconsider 
 
1. Motion to reconsider 
  Twelve days later, on September 17, 2018, DK timely 
moved the court to reconsider its order denying the Motion to Set Aside (Motion for Reconsideration) pursuant to HFCR Rule 59(e).  For the first time, DK cites to HFCR Rule 60(b)(6).   A declaration by Michael Thoemke was attached, appraising JK's home at $679,000 as of July 24, 2017, and represented that the "average for the four homes in this 
neighborhood in 1997 was $222,250 and in 2017 it was $699,500."

   2. JK's Memorandum in Opposition  
 
 In opposition, JK argued that DK "has not brought to 
this court's attention any new evidence or arguments which could 
not have been presented at the August 6, 2018 hearing on her" Motion to Set Aside.  3. DK's Supplemental Declaration    On September 27, 2018, DK provided a supplemental declaration to, among other things, "inform the Court of the psychological aspects of what [she] was going through in the 
spring and early summer of 2017 when [she] missed deadlines and 
court dates."  DK also stated, "the increase in value of the house is $436,000, the increase in equity as a result of paying 
off the mortgage during our marriage is about $70,000, and the 
value of my business is at best the purchase price of $60,000 minus the debt accumulated by the business since purchase ($34,000) which comes out to only $26,000."  (Emphasis added.)   She also declared, "I have never taken a salary from Edible 
Hawaiian Islands, LLC -- only the draws shown on my Schedule C 
returns, which was less than $25,000 per year for those three years."  The following exhibits were attached:

   4. Order Denying Motion to Reconsider 
  On October 1, 2018, the family court denied DK's 
Motion to Reconsider, resolving the issue of HFCR Rule 60(b)(1) 
by finding that DK "has not met the burden of establishing that mistake, inadvertence, surprise, excusable neglect, or newly discovered evidence had occurred, pursuant to H.F.C.R. Rule 59(e) and/or 60(b), justifying the setting aside of the" Order Denying Motion to Set Aside.  The family court also found that DK "has not brought to this court's attention any new evidence or arguments which could not have been presented at the 
August 6, 2018 hearing on [DK's] Motion to Set Aside . . . ." 
  The family court noted that, 
subject to the limitations in [Hawaii Revised Statutes 
(HRS)] § 580-56 and pursuant to Section 25, of the 
[Judgment Granting Divorce and Awarding Child Custody] 
filed July 21, 2017, should either party, Plaintiff and/or Defendant file a Motion for Relief (i.e., Motion for Post 
Decree Relief or a Motion to Enforce Decree), a hearing may 
be set to give both parties an opportunity to be heard, 
should they seek to address the issues within the Divorce Decree, including but not limited to, the non- compliance of 
any part of the Decree." 
 
  DK filed a timely notice of appeal.  
II. DISCUSSION 
  On appeal, DK asserts that the family court erred when 
it failed to set aside the default judgment, pursuant to HFCR NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
 
 
21 
 Rule 60(b).  To that end, DK raises seven points of error to 
this court.  
  HFCR Rule 60(b) provides for relief from a judgment or order, in pertinent part, as follows: 
On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may 
relieve a party or a party's legal representative from any 
or all of the provisions of a final judgment, order, or 
proceeding for the following reasons: 
 
(1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; 
 
(2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b) of these R ules or to 
reconsider, alter, or amend under Rule 59(e); 
 
(3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party; 
 
(4) the judgment is void; 
 
(5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it 
is no longer equitable that the judgment should have 
prospective application; or  
(6) any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.
  
 
(Formatting altered.)  The standard of review for HFCR 
Rule 60(b)(4) is de novo.  Cvitanovich-Dubie v. Dubie, 125 
Hawai‘i 128, 139, 254 P.3d 439, 450 (2011). 
    
explained that the standard of review is the abuse of discretion standard, and "[s]ince Rule 60(b)(6) relief is contrary to the general rule favoring finality of actions, the court must carefully weigh all of the conflicting considerations inherent As for HFCR Rule 60(b)(6), the Supreme CourtHawai‘i NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 in such applications."  Id. (citation omitted).  The abuse of 
discretion standard also applies with regard to HFCR 
Rules 60(b)(1) and (b)(3).  Ledcor-U.S. Pacific Constr. LLC v. 
Joslin, 134 Hawai‘ i 179, 339 P.3d 533, CAAP-12-0000041, 2014 WL 
5905077 at *3 (App. Nov. 13, 2014) (mem.) (regarding HRCP Rules 60(b)(1) and (6)); Plauche v. Plauche, 129 Hawai‘ i

2013) (SDO) (regarding HFCR Rules 60(b)(3) and (6)). 
  "Once the court has made a determination to grant or deny relief, the exercise of its discretion will not be set aside unless the appellate court is persuaded that, under the circumstances of the case, the court abused its discretion" and "an abuse of discretion occurs where the trial court has clearly 
exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles 
of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant."  Id. at 139-40, 254 P.3d at 450-51 (citation 
omitted). A. HFCR Rule 60(b)(4) - Void Judgment       In her first two points of error, DK contends that the judgment is void, citing to HFCR Rule 60(b)(4).  Notably, this argument was not raised in DK's Motion to Set Aside Default and, 
instead, was raised for the first time in her July 25, 2018 
reply to JK's memo in opposition to her Motion to Set Aside Default.  However, "[a] reply must respond only to arguments NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
 
 
23 
 raised in the opposition," and JK's memorandum in opposition did 
not address HFCR Rule 60(b)(4).  Rules of the Circuit Court of 
the State of Hawai‘ i (RCCH) Rule 7(b).  Thus, DK violated RCCH 
Rule 7(b) by raising HFCR Rule 60(b)(4) in her reply. 
  Exercising our discretion, we nonetheless address DK's 
HFCR Rule 60(b)(4) claims that the judgment here is void.  "It has been noted that a judgment is void only if the court that rendered it lacked jurisdiction of either the subject matter or the parties or otherwise acted in a manner inconsistent with due process of the law."  In re Hana Ranch Co., 3 Haw. App. 141, 
146, 642 P.2d 938, 941 (1982).   
1. HFCR Rule 10(c) 
  DK first contends that the family court's "failure to require [JK] to attach the required financial disclosures before granting monetary relief renders the judgment void as a matter of law pursuant to HFCR, Rule 60(b)(4)."  DK specifically challenges the family court's finding that "no due process violation occurred in this matter" and relies on HFCR Rule 10(c).   HFCR Rule 10(c) provides that  
Any motion seeking an order for or modification of 
financial or monetary relief of any kind, except for an 
award of attorney's fees in enforcement proceedings, shall 
have attached, typewritten, unless otherwise permitted by 
the court for good cause shown, income and expense and 
asset and debt statements on the form provided by the court 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
 
 
24 
 or equivalent forms, executed by the movant and duly 
notarized or executed under penalty of perjury.   
 
(Emphasis added.)   
  In his Motion to Compel, JK moved for an order 
"compelling [DK] to respond to [JK's] First Request for 
Production of Documents submitted on January 24, 2017[,]" and 
"awarding [him] his reasonable attorney's fees and costs to for 
[sic] having to file this motion."  Aside from attorney's fees 
that are exempt, this motion did not seek "an order for or 
modification of financial or monetary relief of any kind" to 
require JK to attach "income and expense and asset and debt 
statements" to his motion to compel.  HFCR Rule 10(c). 
  To the extent the July 20, 2017 hearing is construed as addressing an HFCR Rule 10(c) motion, the family court had before it the complaint for divorce, JK's Counsel's representations, and JK's testimony.  JK's Counsel explained 
that JK owned the property prior to the marriage and so DK's 
interest would be the increase in value.  JK's Counsel also represented that the cash flow in DK's business was probably $100,000 a year after expenses, but was unclear if it was before taxes.  She estimated that the value of DK's business would be close to the increase in the value of the property.   The family court asked JK, "is the value of her business, in your opinion, reasonably close to the value of the 
increase in equity, if divided by two, during the marriage?"  JK NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
 
 
25 
 testified, "I think it's close."  This testimony, however, would 
not satisfy the "income and expense and asset and debt 
statements" required by HFCR Rule 10(c).     In determining whether failure to provide "income and expense and asset and debt statements" render the Decree void under HRAP Rule 60(b)(4), we look at whether the family court or the parties "acted in a manner inconsistent with due process of 
the law."  Cvitanovich-Dubie, 125 Hawai‘ i at 141, 254 P.3d at 452 
(citation omitted).  And "in the sound interest of finality, the 
concept of a void judgment must be narrowly restricted."  Id. 
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).   "At its core, procedural due process of law requires 
notice and an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and 
in a meaningful manner before governmental deprivation of a significant liberty [or property] interest."  State v. Bani, 97 
Hawai‘i 285, 293, 36 P.3d 1255, 1263 (2001) (citations omitted).  
"An elementary and fundamental requirement of due process in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality is notice reasonabl[y] calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections."  Calasa v. 
Greenwell, 2 Haw. App. 395, 399, 633 P.2d 553, 556 (1981) 
(citation omitted).  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

   "The notice must be of such nature as reasonably to 
convey the required information, . . . and it must afford a 
reasonable time for those interested to make their appearance[.]  But if with due regard to the practicalities of the case these conditions are reasonably met, the constitutional requirements are satisfied."  Id.  "[D]ue process is flexible and calls for 
procedural protections as the particular situation demands."  Korean Buddhist Dae Won Sa Temple of Hawaii v. Sullivan, 87 
Hawai‘i 217, 243, 953 P.2d 1315, 1341 (1998) (citations omitted). 
  In reviewing this particular situation, DK had five opportunities to produce information related to her finances:  (1) the February 23, 2017 deadline by JK (and while represented 
by counsel); (2) the April 11, 2017 second deadline by JK; 
(3) the May 31, 2017 hearing on JK's Motion to Compel; (4) the July 10, 2017 family court deadline; and (5) the July 20, 2017 hearing.    After missing the February 24, 2017 deadline, DK's attorney withdrew, in part because DK failed to meet deadlines.   The day after missing the April 11, 2017 deadline, DK contacted JK's attorney indicating that she was looking for a new CPA and 
attorney.  On May 2, 2017, DK was provided notice of the May 31, 
2017 hearing, for which she failed to appear.  At that point, DK missed two deadlines to provide her financial information and NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
 
 
27 
 failed to appear at the hearing on the motion to compel 
production of her financial information.     
  Due to DK's failure to appear at the May 31, 2017 hearing, the family court ordered further deadlines for June 13 and 20, 2017 and a hearing for June 27, 2017.  But, because that order was not served upon DK in a timely manner, those June 2017 dates were continued to July 2017, and DK was served with these documents on June 27, 2017.     In addition to the explanation that the June 2017 
dates were continued to July 2017, there should have been no 
confusion about the inapplicability of the June 2017 dates because the documents served on June 27, 2017 would have been delivered to the P.O. Box 849 address after the June 2017 dates had passed.  It was only possible for DK to comply with the July 2017 dates.            DK was also served with a copy of JK's Proposed Judgment, which included a provision that JK would be awarded 
the Property and a provision that DK would be awarded her 
businesses.  DK was cautioned that if she failed to appear, the family court may accept the "proposed Divorce Decree submitted and filed by Plaintiff," and the only proposal submitted and filed by JK was the Proposed Judgment.  Service was made on June 27, 2017 to the P.O. Box 849 mailing address that DK provided to the court. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
 
 
28 
     Although not a model of clarity, when read in its 
entirety, and in context with the date of service, the documents 
served upon DK on June 27, 2017 informed her of when (July 20, 2017 at 10:00 a.m.) and where (Courtroom 3A) to appear.  These documents also conveyed the possible consequence (accepting the proposal filed by JK) should DK fail to appear or fail to provide her financial information.
 
  In other words, under the circumstances in this case, DK was afforded adequate notice to apprise her of the pending 
action, and proceeding without an HFCR Rule 10(c) statement by 
JK did not violate due process.  Accordingly, the family court's finding of "no due process violation" was not erroneous.   Only after DK disregarded three deadlines to provide financial information and missed two hearings did the family court accept the only proposition on the table, JK's Proposed 
Judgment.  Moreover, requiring JK to provide "income and expense 
and asset and debt statements" for HFCR Rule 10(c) purposes 
during the July 20, 2017 hearing would have been futile for 
dividing the property if the family court did not have DK's financial information with which to compare it.    Thus, the family court's denial of DK's motion to set aside the judgment as void for failing to comply with HFCR Rule 10(c) was not wrong. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
 
 
29 
  2. HFCR Rule 37 
  DK next contends that HFCR Rule 55 "is not a 
permissible sanction for failure to comply with a discovery order under HFCR Rule 37" (formatting altered).  DK argues that "[b]ecause default was entered against [her] as an impermissible sanction for a discovery order - and not for any failure to file an answer - the Family Court's entry of default on June 26, 2017 [] was void pursuant to HFCR, Rule 60(b)(4)."  Here, HFCR Rule 37 applied, and not HFCR Rule 55. 
  "Without leave of the court . . . , any party may 
serve upon any other party written interrogatories" and "[e]ach interrogatory shall be answered separately and fully in writing under oath, unless it is objected to, in which event the objecting party shall state the reasons for objection and shall answer to the extent the interrogatory is not objectionable."  HFCR Rules 33(a) and (b)(1).  "The party submitting the interrogatories may move for an order under Rule 37(a) of these 
Rules with respect to any objection to or other failure to 
answer an interrogatory."  HFCR Rule 33(b)(5).    If "a party fails to answer an interrogatory submitted under Rule 33 of these Rules, . . . the discovering party may move for an order compelling an answer . . . ."  HFCR Rule 37(a)(2).  Where a motion to compel is granted and a party fails to obey the order, the family court may make "[a]n order NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
 
 
30 
 striking out pleadings or parts thereof, or staying further 
proceedings until the order is obeyed, or dismissing the action 
or proceedings or any part thereof, or rendering a judgment by default against the disobedient party[.]"  HFCR Rule 37(b)(2)(C)(emphasis added).  
 
  As stated, DK missed the first deadline (February 23, 2017) to provide her financial information.  DK's counsel then moved to withdraw, in part because DK was not complying with deadlines.  DK missed her second deadline (April 11, 2017) to 
provide information.  JK moved to compel, and attached a notice 
indicating that a hearing on the motion was set for May 31, 2017 
at 10:00 a.m.  DK was served a copy of the Motion to Compel and 
Notice of Motion at the P.O. Box 849 mailing address she 
provided to the court. 
  When DK did not appear at the May 31, 2017 hearing, 
the family court found DK "is hereby in default for her failure 
to appear herein[,]" granted JK's Motion to Compel Discovery, 
awarded JK's attorney's fees and costs, and scheduled a further 
hearing on the matter.  That order was entered on June 26, 2017, 
and that is the default order DK challenges in her second point 
of error. 
  When DK failed to appear on May 31, 2017, the family 
court found her in default for failing to appear and scheduled 
another hearing on the matter.  Nowhere in the June 26, 2017 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
31 order did the family court cite to HFCR Rule 55 or enter a 
judgment of default.  Instead, the family court gave DK another 
opportunity to comply with the order granting JK's Motion to 
Compel.  Further, the family court gave DK notice in paragraph 6 
of the June 26, 2017 order that "if [DK] fails to appear at that 
status hearing mentioned above or fails to respond to the 
discovery requests by the deadline stated herein, the court may 
granted [sic] the proposed Divorce Decree submitted and filed by 
[JK]." 
Based on this record, the June 26, 2017 order finding 
DK in default for failing to appear was not a "default judgment" 
pursuant to HFCR Rule 55.  And even if it was a default judgment, 
such a judgment is authorized by HFCR Rule 37(b)(2)(C).  A trial 
court is given broad discretion when imposing sanctions for 
discovery abuse, and there was no abuse of discretion in finding 
DK in default for failing to appear on May 31, 2017 and providing 
her another opportunity to comply with the order granting JK's 
Motion to Compel Discovery.  See Aloha Unlimited, Inc., 79 Hawai‘ i 
527, 532-33, 904 P.2d 541, 546-47.  
In sum, the family court's denial of DK's motion to 
set aside the judgment as void based on HFCR Rule 60(b)(4) was 
not wrong. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
32 B. HFCR Rule 60(b)(6)
In her third point of error, relying on HFCR 
Rule 60(b)(6) (other reasons justifying relief), DK argues that 
"[t]he one-sided divorce decree drafted by [JK] is so disproportionately in his favor as to be unconscionable."  DK clarifies she "is not appealing the divorce, but is appealing the division of assets."  
DK, however, raised this issue for the first time in 
her motion for reconsideration.  "[T]he purpose of a motion for 
reconsideration is to allow the parties to present new evidence 
and/or arguments that could not have been presented during the earlier adjudicated motion."  See Kamaka v. Goodsill Anderson 
Quinn & Stifel, 117 Hawai‘ i 92, 104, 176 P.3d 91, 103 (2008) 
(citation omitted).  It "is not a device to relitigate old matters or raise new arguments or evidence that could and should have been brought during the earlier proceeding."  Id.   
Pursuant to HFCR Rule 60(b)(6), the court may relieve 
a party from any or all provisions of a final judgment for "any 
other reason justifying relief from the operation of the 
judgment."  But, HFCR Rule 60(b)(6) "is only invoked upon a 
showing of exceptional circumstances."  Thomas-Yukimura v. 
Yukimura, 130  1, 9, 304 P.3d 1182, 1190 (2013) (citation Hawai‘i
omitted); see also Nakata v. Nakata, 3 Haw. App. 51, 56, 641 
P.2d 333, 336 (1982) (stating HFCR Rule 60(b) is not intended toNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
33 "reliev[e] a party from free, calculated, and deliberate choices
he, she, or it has made") (citations omitted).    
Included with her Motion for Reconsideration and 
supplemental declaration, DK provided information appraising the
increase in the value of the Property, an incomplete assignment 
of rights for her business dated for 2013, American Web invoices
dated in 2015 and 2017, unsigned 2015 and 2016 tax information, 
correspondence related to sales of artwork dated November 3 and 
24, 2017, and correspondence related to advertisement for a one-
bedroom apartment dated March 6, 2018.    
 
DK, however, provided no explanation as to why these 
documents or information could not have been provided with her 
June 20, 2018 Motion to Set Aside or at the August 6, 2018 
hearing.  With no explanation from DK and no transcripts of the 
August 6, 2018 hearing, we cannot say that the family court 
erred in finding DK "has not brought to this court's attention 
any new evidence or arguments which could not have been 
presented at the August 6, 2018 hearing on [her] Motion to Set 
Aside Default Judgment."  Thus, the family court's denial of 
DK's Motion to Reconsider based on HFCR Rule 60(b)(6) was not an 
abuse of its discretion. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
 
 
34 
 C. HFCR Rule 60(b)(3) - Fraud, Misrepresentation, Misconduct 
 
  In her fourth, fifth, and sixth points of error DK 
relies on HFCR Rule 60(b)(3) for fraud, misrepresentation, or 
misconduct. 
  Under the two-part test for HRCP Rule 60(b)(3), which 
is nearly identical to HFCR Rule 60(b)(3), 'the movant must, (1) prove by clear and convincing evidence that the verdict was obtained through fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct, and (2) establish that the conduct complained of prevented the 
losing party from fully and fairly presenting [her] case or 
defense."  Kawamata Farms, Inc. v. United Agri Prods., 86 Hawai‘ i 
214, 251-52, 948 P.2d 1055, 1092-93 (1997) (cleaned up).  "In 
all averments of fraud or mistake, the circumstances 
constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity."  HFCR Rule 9(b); HFCR Rule 60(b) (providing in part that for HFCR Rule 60(b)(3), "the averments in the motion shall be made in compliance with Rule 9(b) of these Rules"). 
1. Misrepresentation    
  In her fourth point of error, DK contends that the family court "abused its discretion by failing to set aside the 
July 20, 2017 default judgment."  DK argues that "[r]eviewing 
the transcript side by side with the outcome leads to the conclusion that Judge Poelman was misled by [JK's] misrepresentations." NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
 
 
35 
   DK, however, did not raise this argument or provide a 
transcript of the July 20, 2017 hearing when she filed her 
Motion to Set Aside Default.  See HRS § 641–2 (2016) ("The 
appellate court . . . need not consider a point that 
was not presented in the trial court in an appropriate manner.")  
DK furnished the July 20, 2017 transcripts with her Motion for 
Reconsideration, but failed to provide any explanation as to why 
that evidence could not have been presented in her Motion to Set 
Aside or the August 6, 2018 hearing on the Motion to Set Aside.     As stated above, a motion for reconsideration "is not 
a device to relitigate old matters."  Kamaka, 117 Hawai‘ i at 104, 
176 P.3d at 103.  The July 20, 2017 transcripts "could and 
should have been brought during the earlier proceeding."  Id.  
Thus, the family court did not abuse its discretion in denying 
DK's Motion for Reconsideration based on misrepresentation under HFCR Rule 60(b)(3).  2. Resolving doubt   In her fifth point of error, DK contends that the family court "abused its discretion by failing to resolve any doubt as to the accuracy of JK's representations in favor of 
[DK] under HFCR, Rule 60(b)(3)."  In her opening brief, DK 
points out that this issue was "presented to the Family Court at p.9 of [her] motion for reconsideration."  In that section of her Motion for Reconsideration, DK fails to provide any reason NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
 
 
36 
 why this argument could not have been raised in her Motion to 
Set Aside or during the August 6, 2017 hearing on her Motion to 
Set Aside.  Thus, we cannot say that the family court erred in determining that DK "has not brought to this court's attention any new evidence or arguments which could not have been presented at the August 6, 2018 hearing on [her] Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment."  3. Misconduct   In her sixth point of error, DK contends that the 
family court "abused its discretion by failing to set aside the 
July 20, 2017 default judgment under HFCR Rule 60(b)(3) as it was procured by 'other misconduct.'"   DK argues that her "reasonable efforts to prepare financial disclosures, and to secure defense counsel to comply with court orders, were stymied in large part by [JK's] 'misconduct.'"  DK alleges there were three instances of misconduct - (a) JK "interfering with [her] preparation of 
financial disclosures[,]" (b) JK's "misuse of control of the 
couple's money[,]" and (c) JK's "failure to make financial disclosures" – that, individually or "[t]aken together, . . . provides this Court with ample evidence to find that the family court abused its discretion when it failed to set aside the default judgment based on misconduct within HFCR, Rule 60(b)(3)."  (Formatting altered.) NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
 
 
37 
   DK, however, did not provide any evidence that there 
was misconduct regarding the CPA services of Berman.  DK 
provided a letter from Berman, dated April 18, 2017, stating he cannot prepare her 2016 tax return "[d]ue to ethical reasons and conflicts of interest."  But, the letter makes no reference to any kind of misconduct by JK, and JK received a similar letter.    DK's "Income and Expense" statement described her salary and her housing, transportation, and personal expenses for the month, and her "Asset and Debt Statement" described two 
checking accounts, a cemetery plot, and debts from Square, 
Hawaiian Air, American Express, and Hana Rose.  DK does not explain how any of these disclosures showed fraudulent misconduct by JK or what conduct by JK prevented her from disclosing this information during the 2017 proceedings.    Moreover, DK did not provide evidence in her motion to set aside default of JK misusing the couple's money.  JK, however, provided copies of numerous processed checks showing 
that DK wrote checks on JK's business bank account. 
  And, as discussed above, JK was not required to file financial disclosures with his Motion to Compel and, thus, that was not misconduct on JK's part.  Also as discussed above, JK's testimony during the July 20, 2017 hearing was not a substitute for HFCR Rule 10(c) financial statements.  But, this does not amount to HFCR Rule 60(b)(3) misconduct by JK.   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
 
 
38 
   Accordingly, DK did not establish that the judgment in 
this case was obtained by JK's fraudulent misconduct, and with 
no transcripts of the August 6, 2017 hearing, we cannot say that the family court abused its discretion by denying DK's Motion to Set Aside based on HFCR Rule 60(b)(3). 
D. HFCR Rule 60(b)(1) - Excusable Neglect 
  In her seventh and final point of error, DK contends 
that the family court "abused its discretion by failing to set 
aside the July 20, 2017 default judgment under HFCR 
Rule 60(b)(1) on the grounds of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, 
or excusable neglect."  DK argues that her failure to appear at 
the two hearings was excusable.   
  "The determination of what conduct constitutes 
'excusable neglect' under Rule 60(b)(1) and similar rules 'is at 
bottom an equitable one, taking account of all relevant 
circumstances surrounding the party's omission.'"  Brandt v. Am. 
Bankers Ins. Co. of Florida, 653 F.3d 1108, 1111 (9th Cir. 2011) 
(quoting Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. Brunswick Assoc. Ltd., 507 
U.S. 380, 395 (1993)).  "[A] party cannot have relief under 
60(b)(1) merely because he is unhappy with the judgment.  
Instead he must make some showing of why he was justified in 
failing to avoid mistake or inadvertence.  Gross carelessness is 
not enough."  Joaquin v. Joaquin, 5 Haw. App. 435, 443, 698 P.2d 
298, 304 (1985) (citations omitted and emphasis added).  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
 
 
39 
 1. Attorney 
  DK argues that her difficulty finding an attorney 
contributed to her failure to appear at the two hearings.  She asserts that she "was unable to find a Maui Family Law attorney who was willing to take her case" because "they had a conflict of interest" with JK and the per diem judge with whom he had a relationship.   The record indicates that on April 12 and 28, 2017, DK communicated with JK's lawyer that she was still looking for an 
attorney, and moved her search to O‘ ahu.  In her declaration, DK 
named four attorneys she contacted, with two willing to 
represent her but she did not have the funds to hire one and she 
declined to proceed with another due to a conflict with a 
contractor.   But, DK does not explain how difficulties in obtaining an attorney justified her failure to appear at the scheduled hearings.  Should DK have appeared at one of the hearings, she could have explained her difficulty in finding an attorney to the family court and requested more time.       2. E-mail 
  DK also argues that another factor contributing to her 
missing the two hearings was because JK's counsel did not send her a courtesy e-mail of the hearings.  DK cites to no legal authority that requires JK to provide a courtesy e-mail of any NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
 
 
40 
 upcoming hearings.  Instead, the record indicates that JK's 
counsel properly notified DK pursuant to HFCR Rule 5. 
 3. Notice   DK further argues that lack of notice and confusing and conflicting notices contributed to her missing the two hearings.  As to the lack-of-notice argument, DK asserts that "the Court's May 31 order was not served on [her] until 14 days after the June 13 deadline."  DK is correct that the May 31, 2017 order regarding the June 2017 deadlines and hearing was not 
served on her until after the deadlines had passed.  But, she is 
not being held accountable for missing the June 2017 deadlines and hearing because she was not served, and the June 2017 deadlines and hearing were continued to July 2017.  Thus, the lack of notice of the May 31, 2017 order does not demonstrate excusable neglect for missing the two hearings.    As to her confusing-and-conflicting argument, DK asserts that "at a time when [she] was unrepresented, she was 
served simultaneously with confusing and conflicting notices."  
This assertion, like the lack-of-notice assertion does not apply to, or demonstrate excusable neglect for, DK missing the first hearing on May 31, 2017.   For the July 20, 2017 hearing, DK was served with two filings.  The first was "the Ex Parte Motion to Extend Deadlines and to Continue Status hearing; Exhibit 'A'; Declaration of NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
 
 
41 
 Counsel; Ex Parte Order filed June 26, 2017[,]" and the second 
was "the Order of the Hearing Held May 31, 2017 on Plaintiff's 
Motion to Compel Discovery and for Attorney's Fees and Costs filed May 4, 2017; Exhibits 'A' and 'B' filed June 26, 2017[.]"   In the first filing, the first page stated that JK moves "for an order extending the deadlines in this matter and continuing the status hearing currently set for June 27, 2017."   That first page also stated, "The grounds for this Motion are that [DK] has not been served with the Order relating to the 
Motion to Compel Discovery filed May 5, 2017 and heard on 
May 31, 2017."  Thus, that first page explained that the June 2017 deadlines and the June 27, 2017 hearing, should be extended because DK had not been served.    The third page of the first document is the "Declaration of Counsel," which stated that "[i]t is respectfully requested that the Court continue the deadlines ordered at the hearing of May 31, 2017."  The declaration is 
then followed by the "Ex Parte Order," which set forth July 
deadlines handwritten in blue ink, and the July hearing date stamped.  This order was signed by the judge, also in blue ink.   In the second filing, the first page is entitled "Order of the Hearing Held May 31, 2017 on Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Discovery and For Attorney's Fees and Costs Filed May 4, 2017."  This document set forth the June deadlines, which, as DK NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
 
 
42 
 noted, had already passed by the time she received these 
documents. 
  In sum, the documents show that the June 2017 dates needed to be continued because DK was not served in a timely manner, the June 2017 dates had passed by the time the documents were served on DK, and the July dates were the only dates with which DK could comply.  Thus, serving the documents that established the June 2017 deadlines and hearing with the documents that set forth the continued July 2017 deadlines and 
hearing, did not provide an excuse for failing to appear at the 
July 20, 2017 hearing.  Joaquin, 5 Haw. App. at 442, 698 P.2d at 
303 (explaining that "[a] mistake as to the nature and effect of 
a document caused by a failure to read it is not an excusable 
mistake") (citation omitted); Pogia v. Ramos, 10 Haw. App. 411, 
417, 876 P.2d 1342, 1345–46 (1994) (explaining that "'lack of 
legal sophistication . . . cannot form the basis of a claim of 
excusable neglect . . . for purposes of Rule 60(b)' where the 
defendant, after receiving notice, failed to appear or answer") 
(citation omitted).  Accordingly, DK did not show why she was 
justified in failing to appear at the July 20, 2017 hearing. 
  DK's missing the July hearing was not an aberrant act 
on the record in this case.  Instead, it was a continuation of 
her conduct throughout the discovery process, where she 
repeatedly failed to provide her financial information.  This NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
43 failure to provide financial information deprived JK, and the 
family court, of information needed to proceed to trial.  See 
Aloha Unlimited, Inc., 79 Hawai ‘i at 533, 904 P.2d at 547. 
4. Equity
Again, "[t]he determination of what conduct
constitutes 'excusable neglect' under Rule 60(b)(1) and similar 
rules 'is at bottom an equitable one, taking account of all 
relevant circumstances surrounding the party's 
omission.'"  Brandt, 653 F.3d at 1111 (citation omitted).  The 
gist of DK's appeal is that the division of property was unfair 
because, as DK stated, "the increase in equity as a result of paying off the mortgage during our marriage is about $70,000, 
and the value of my business is at best the purchase price of 
$60,000 minus the debt accumulated by the business since purchase ($34,000) which comes out to only $26,000." 
But the information DK provided to the family court 
regarding her business was vague and conflicting.  In the income and expense statement attached to her motion to set aside, DK represented that Edible Hawaiian Islands Magazine was her employer, and she earned a gross, net, and take-home pay of 
$4,166 per month.  Also, DK provided no information about Edible 
Hawaiian Islands Magazine in the attached Asset and Debt Statement.  About a month later, DK filed a revised Asset and NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
 
 
44 
 Debt Statement that included Edible Hawaiian Island Magazine 
valued at $60,000 with a debt of $34,000. 
  In connection with her Motion for Reconsideration less than two months later, DK provided an agreement to acquire Edible Hawaiian Island Magazine for $60,000 dated for 2013 that was not signed by the seller.  And, in contrast to her income and expense statement, DK represented to the court, "I have never taken a salary from Edible Hawaiian Islands, LLC -- only the draws shown on my Schedule C returns, which was less than 
$25,000 per year for those three years." 
  Taking account of all the relevant circumstances 
surrounding DK's failure to meet deadlines, appear at hearings, 
and provide reliable information regarding the income from and 
value of her business, we cannot say that her conduct 
constituted excusable neglect.  As such, we cannot say the family court abused its discretion by denying DK's Motion to Set Aside and Motion for Reconsideration based on HFCR Rule 
60(b)(1).

  For the reasons above, we affirm the family court's

 DISSENTING OPINION by Nakasone, J.
I respectfully dissent because I would hold that the 
default judgment should have been set aside under Hawai ‘i Family 
Court Rules ( HFCR) Rule 60(b)(1) for excusable neglect under the
particular circumstances of this case, where: (1) the default 
judgment was entered during a time period after DK's counsel hadwithdrawn and DK was without counsel ( Self-Represented DK ); (2)
Self-Represented DK received two notices that left ambiguities  
about the adequacy of notification of the family court's 
discovery and continuance orders leading to the default judgment; (3) the default judgment was entered as a sanction fora discovery violation under circumstances that did not appear  extreme enough to warrant this level of sanction; (4) DK provided an explanation for her neglect to render it excusable 
under a broad, equitable inquiry of the circumstances; and (5) 
assuming arguendo  there was doubt as to whether Self-Represented
DK's neglect was excusable, any doubt must be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief from a default judgment in the interest of justice, consistent with the public policy of favoring disposition of cases on their merits.   1 
 
 
 
 
1. Default judgments are disfavored and any doubt
should be resolved in favor of the party seeking
relief.
"[T]he sanction of a default judgment is a harsh 
one."  Rearden Fam. Tr. v. Wisenbaker, 101 Hawai ‘i 237, 254, 65 
P.3d 1029, 1046 (2003).  "Generally, default judgments are not
favored because they do not afford parties an opportunity to litigate claims or defenses on the merits."  In re Genesys Data 
1I refer to DK as "Self-Represented DK" during the time period 
from March 9, 2017 (date of hearing at which DK's counsel was allowed to 
withdraw) to July 24, 2017 (date default judgment was filed).  DK's new 
counsel made his first appearance upon filing DK's Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment on June 29, 2018. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʿI REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER
2 Techs., Inc., 95 Hawai ‘i 33, 40, 18 P.3d 895, 902 (2001) 
(citations omitted).    
In Wisenbaker, the Hawai ‘i Supreme Court 
reaffirmed that "defaults and default judgments are not favored 
and that any doubt should be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief, so that, in the interest of justice, there can 
be a full trial on the merits."  101 
Hawai ‘i at 254, 65 P.3d at 
1046 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  Citing these principles in In re TW,  124 Hawai ‘i 468, 
472, 248 P.3d 234, 238 (App. 2011),  we held that the family 
court "abused its discretion in imposing the harsh and drastic 
sanction of default against Mother based upon her single non-appearance" and in granting the Department of Human Service's petition for permanent custody of the mother's child.  Id. at 474, 248 P.3d at 240.  Where a court has "the ability to levy 
lesser sanctions" such as "attorney's fees and monetary 
sanctions" for a party's failure to attend a conference or a hearing, the imposition of such lesser sanctions "better serves 
the interest of justice."  Dela Cruz v. Quemado, 141 Hawai ‘i 338, 
345-46, 409 P.3d 742, 749-50 (2018) (citing Wisenbaker, 101
Hawai‘i at 255, 65 P.3d at 1047) (brackets and internal quotation
marks omitted).
2. Default judgment as a discovery sanction is a
drastic measure appropriate as a last resort or
only under extreme circumstances, such as
willful, contemptuous or otherwise opprobrious
behavior.
This case did not involve a default judgment entered 
under HFCR Rule 55(b) where a party had "failed to appear or 
otherwise defend[.]"  Rather, it was a default judgment entered as a discovery sanction under HFCR Rule 37(b)(2)(c).  See 
Wisenbaker, 101 Hawai ‘i at 253-54, 65 P.3d at 1045-46 (holding 
that where default judgment was imposed as a sanction under RCCH NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʿI REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER        
 
3 
 Rule 12.1 for settlement-conference-related conduct, Hawai ‘i 
Rules of Civil Procedure ( HRCP
) Rule 55(c) was not the 
appropriate basis for motion to set aside default judgment and 
defendant could move for relief under Rule 60(b)).  In Long v. 
Long, 101 Hawai ‘i 400, 405-06, 69 P.3d 528, 533-34 (App. 2003), 
we observed that "granting judgments on default as sanctions for 
violating discovery orders are generally deemed appropriate only as a last resort, or when less drastic sanctions would not 
ensure compliance with a court's orders."  (emphasis added) 
(quoting 7 J. Moore, Moore's Federal Practice § 37.50[2][a] (3d ed. 2002)).  In W.H. Shipman, Ltd. v. Hawaiian Holiday Macadamia Nut Co. Inc., 8 Haw. App. 354, 361-63, 802 P.2d 1203, 1207-1208 (1990), this court construed the parallel provision in the HRCP, Rule 37(b)(2), and noted that:  "[t]he federal cases indicate 
that the Rule 37(b)(2)(c) drastic sanctions of dismissal and 
default judgment are authorized only in extreme circumstances[;]" and these sanctions "represent the most severe penalty that can be imposed." (cleaned up) (citations omitted).   
  "[T]he trial court has a broad spectrum of sanctions to impose, although the sanction chosen must be commensurate 
with the offense."  Weinberg v. Dickson-Weinberg, 123 Hawai ‘i 68, 
75, 229 P.3d 1133, 1140 (2010) (italics and citations omitted).  
"[A] sanction which is tantamount to the entry of default 'should be supported by evidence of willful or contemptuous or 
otherwise opprobrious behavior.'"  TW, 124 Hawai ‘i at 473, 248 
P.3d at 239 (quoting Weinberg, 123 Hawai ‘i at 77, 229 P.3d at 
1142).  The following five factors are considered in when 
reviewing whether an entry of default judgment as a discovery sanction constitutes an abuse of discretion:  "'(1) the public's interest in the expeditious resolution of litigation; (2) the court's need to manage its docket; (3) the risk of prejudice to NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʿI REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER        
 
4 
 the party moving for sanctions; (4) the public policy favoring 
disposition of cases on their merits; and (5) the availability 
of less drastic sanctions.'"  Id. (citation omitted) (quoting 
Weinberg, 123 Hawai ‘i at 71, 229 P.3d at 1136). 
  Here, Self-Represented DK's discovery violation was 
for failing to respond to the first Request for Production of Documents  by a February 23, 2017 deadline.  The motion to compel 
discovery was filed on May 4, 2017 and heard on May 31, 2017, 
after Self-Represented DK's counsel had withdrawn.  The motion 
to compel requested, inter alia , that Self-Represented DK be 
ordered to respond, and for attorney's fees and costs.  The motion argued that "[JK] has been more than reasonable in waiting more than two months for [DK]'s responses."  It also requested the further sanction under HFCR Rule 37(b)(2) that:  "[i]f [DK] fails to respond as ordered by this court, [JK] 
respectfully requests this court issue sanctions against [DK], 
including, but not limited to, refusing to allow [DK] to introduce evidence at the trial in this matter."  Notably, JK did not request the sanction of default judgment in his motion.   2
In the Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment, DK set 
forth her reasons for missing the first May 31, 2017 hearing and 
the second July 20, 2017 status hearing on the motion to compel. 
DK's declaration explained that during the relevant time period,  
                     
2 The Request for Production of Documents ( RPOD) was dated January 
24, 2017, approximately three months after JK's October 20, 2016 Complaint.  
The RPOD was a detailed, complex listing of 33 numbered requests, excluding subparts, covering a wide range of real estate and financial documents, including every conceivable type of asset and source of potential income and 
liability.  The RPOD included, inter alia , all statements for all business 
accounts for the last four years, all check registers or electronic registers 
for the last three years, all checks  signed for any account in DK's name for the last three years, loan applications in the last five years, all credit card statements for the last three years, asset ownership and value documents 
at the date of marriage, documents reflecting debt/liabilities as of the date 
of marriage, and a list of 25 sub-requests pertaining to "Edible 
Hawai ‘i 
Islands[.]"

 she and the couple's teen daughter were moving out of the family 
home, where DK had lived for 23 years; DK was working two jobs; 
DK had no counsel at the time she received the "confusing and 
conflicting" hearing notices; and DK was "scrambling to find a replacement attorney" that she could afford and who did not "have a conflict of interest" due to JK's relationship with a per diem family court judge.   In light of Self-Represented DK's 
3
                     
3  DK's declaration stated:    
 
3. In the four months that followed, I missed two
important hearings:  
 
a. A discovery hearing on May 31 (2 days after my daughter and I moved out of our family home); and 
 
b. A hearing for entry of default judgment on July 20, 2017 (originally set for June 27, 2017, but 
continued the day before the hearing, to July 20). 
The hearing was continued by [JK]'s attorney Ex Parte -- i.e., without notice to me. 
 
4. The following factors contributed to my missing these 
vital hearings: 
 
a. Unrepresented by Counsel . I was unrepresented 
by counsel as I was scrambling to find a replacement 
attorney (i) who I could afford; and (ii) who did not
have a conflict of interest either because they had 
already been consulted by [JK], or because of [JK]'s extra-marital affair with Michelle Drewyer, who, at that time, was a Per Diem Family Court Judge;  
 
b. Moving. I was moving out of the family home we 
had lived in for the last 23 years, with my 16 year old daughter, []; 
 
c. Working two jobs . I was working long hours to 
pay for the living expenses of myself and my daughter. I took on a second job cleaning commercial properties.  [JK] made no financial contributions to our living expenses; 
 
d. Change of address . I changed my personal 
address from our family home to my business P.O. box;  
 
e. Lack of Notification . [JK]'s attorney contacted 
me by phone and email regarding settlement and 
discovery but in those conversations she never 
notified me of any hearing dates, nor did she provide me with a courtesy copy of upcoming motions or NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʿI REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER        
 
6 
 explanation, her self-represented status, and the ambiguities 
surrounding the adequacy of the notification in the discovery 
and continuance orders Self-Represented DK received, as 
explained infra, the evidence does not show that there was "willful or contemptuous or otherwise opprobrious behavior" bySelf-Represented DK to warrant the imposition of the harshest  
 
                     
hearing dates, which she could easily have done via 
email, voicemail, or text. 
 
f. [JK] also neglected to notify me of any hearing
dates despite the fact that he knew I was unrepresented, I was still living in the family home,and he met with me on both May 28 and May 29, and on 
neither occasion did he let me know verbally, or by 
text, voicemail, or email, that there was an important hearing just two days later, on May 31
st.  
 
 
g. Lack of Service . [JK]'s attorney did not serve 
the Court's May 31 order on me until June 27, 2018 
[sic] - 14 days after the June 13 deadline to comply with the order had passed! See Plaintiffs Ex Parte Motion attached as Exhibit A in which plaintiffs attorney admits that I was not served with the May 31 
order: 
 
. . . . 
 
h.  Confusing and Conflicting Notices . To add to 
the confusion, when [JK]'s attorney finally did servethe May 31 order, she did so at the same time as an Ex Parte Order filed on June 26, 2017 with the resultthat, at a time when I was unrepresented, I was served simultaneously with confusing and conflicting 
notices. . . .  
 
 
5. As a consequence, [JK] obtained a discovery order and 
a default judgment against me during this transitional 
period when I was moving out of the family home, and when I 
was unrepresented by counsel. 
 
DK also listed the names of all of the family law attorneys she had 
contacted on Maui in her attempt to find replacement counsel, and stated she expanded her search to Oahu due to the "relatively small 
pool of family law attorneys on Maui."  DK finally found her current 
counsel who was willing to handle her case, but she could not afford the retainer.  DK explained that: "[i]t was only as the one-year deadline to file this motion was approaching that my attorney reviewedmy case with the Office of Disciplinary Counsel and determined that he
could defer payment of his fees until the case is resolved without 
violating the rules governing attorneys, which he then offered to do."

 discovery sanction of default judgment -- relief that went 
beyond the attorney's fees and costs and preclusion of evidence
sanctions that JK's motion requested pursuant to HFCR Rule 
37(b)(2).  TW, 124 Hawai ‘i at 473, 248 P.3d at 239 (quoting 
Weinberg, 123 Hawai ‘i at 77, 229 P.3d at 1142).  
3. The two notices that Self-Represented DK  
received leading up to the default judgment  
left ambiguities about the adequacy of their 
notification. 
 
  In Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. Brunswick Assocs. Ltd. 
P'ship, 507 U.S. 380, 398 (1993), the United States ( U.S.) 
Supreme Court found that a notice that was "outside the ordinary course" in a bankruptcy case due to its "'peculiar and inconspicuous placement'" left a "dramatic ambiguity" in the adequacy of the notification.  (Citation omitted).  Pioneer set forth an equitable standard for review of "excusable neglect" for tardy claims filed after a bankruptcy court's "bar date" 
deadline; and this same equitable standard was expressly adopted 
by the Hawai ‘i Supreme Court in Enos v. Pac. Transfer & 
Warehouse, Inc., 80 
Hawai ‘i 345, 352, 910 P.2d 116, 123 (1996), 
and Eckard Brandes, Inc. v. Dep't. of Labor and Indus. Rels., 146 Hawai ‘i 354, 364, 463 P.3d 1011, 1021 (2020), to review 
"excusable neglect" for late extensions of time to file a notice of appeal under Hawai ‘i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 
4(a)(4)(B).  The problematic notice in Pioneer was a significant 
factor in the U.S. Supreme Court's conclusion that counsel's neglect in that case was excusable, as follows: 
 
In assessing the culpability of respondents' counsel, 
we give little weight to the fact that counsel was 
experiencing upheaval in his law practice at the time of the bar date.  We do, however, consider significant that 
the notice of the bar date provided by the Bankruptcy Court 
in this case was outside the ordinary course in bankruptcy cases.  As the Court of Appeals noted, ordinarily the bar NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʿI REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER
8 date in a bankruptcy case should be prominently announced 
and accompanied by an explanation of its significance.  We 
agree with the court that the "peculiar and inconspicuous placement of the bar date in a notice regarding a creditors' meeting," without any indication of the significance of the bar date, left a "dramatic ambiguity" 
in the notification.  This is not to say, of course, that 
respondents' counsel was not remiss in failing to apprehend the notice.  To be sure, were there any evidence of prejudice to petitioner or to judicial administration in this case, or any indication at all of bad faith, we could 
not say that the Bankruptcy Court abused its discretion in 
declining to find the neglect to be "excusable."  In the absence of such a showing, however, we conclude that the unusual form of notice employed in this case requires a finding that the neglect of respondents' counsel was, under 
all the circumstances, "excusable."

Here, in my view, the two notices served 
simultaneously appear to be "confusing and conflicting" as DK stated in her declaration, and leave ambiguities in the adequacy
of the notification provided to a self-represented party like 
DK.  The "Ex Parte Motion to Extend Deadline and to Continue Status Hearing" ( 6/26/17 EPM to Continue 6/27/17  Hearing ) and 
the "Order of the Hearing Held May 31, 2017 on Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Discovery and for Attorney's Fees and Costs filed May 4, 2017" ( Order of 5/31/17 Hearing ) were both filed 
simultaneously on June 26, 2017, the day prior to the June 27, 
2017 continued hearing on JK's motion to compel discovery.  The 
single Certificate of Service ( COS
) filed June 27, 2017, 
indicates that Self-Represented DK was simultaneously served with two documents at her P.O. Box.  
Document No. 1:  6/26/17 EPM to Continue 6/27/17
Hearing  
The 6/26/17 EPM to Continue 6/27/17 Hearing is a six-
page document.  Notably, it is filed "ex parte," without any 
notice to the other side, seeking a last-minute continuance of the next day's hearing, the afternoon before the hearing.  The NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʿI REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER
9 Declaration of Counsel does not indicate whether JK's counsel 
made efforts to notify Self-Represented DK regarding the last-
minute EPM to continue the hearing, as would be required in the 
circuit court.  Cf. Rules of the Circuit Court of 
Hawai ‘i (RCCH) 
Rule 7.2(f).   4
The Declaration of Counsel states that JK's counsel 
"has drafted the Order of the hearing held May 31, 2017, but has
not provided a copy to [Self-Represented DK]."  This statement 
indicates that Self-Represented DK was not given any information
about what occurred at the May 31, 2017 discovery hearing that she missed and had not received any notice of the subsequent June 27, 2017 hearing.    
 
The "Ex Parte Order" is inconspicuously placed, and 
does not appear until page five of the EPM.  The Ex Parte Order 
sets a new deadline of July 10, 2017 for Self-Represented DK to 
comply with the discovery order and a new date of July 20, 2017 
for a "status hearing" on the motion to compel.  The final paragraph warns Self-Represented DK that if she "fails to appear at that status hearing mentioned above or fails to respond to the discovery requests by the deadline stated herein, the court 
4The HFCR do not have any rules pertaining to ex parte filings.  
By contrast, RCCH Rule 7.2, which applies only to cases governed by the HRCP,
does contain a rule regarding last-minute ex parte filings, for which there 
are a number of requirements for EPMs and shortening of time including:  the 
reasons for filing the motion ex parte, efforts made to notify parties, and, 
if shortening time or advancing a hearing, the efforts made to obtain a 
stipulation or response from the other parties in the case, or an explanationstating the reasons why "no attempt was made."  See RCCH Rule 7.2(f) (2014) 
("A motion entitled to be heard ex parte shall: (1) cite the statute, rule, 
or other authority authorizing the court to entertain the motion ex parte; 
(2) be supported by an affidavit or declaration stating the reason(s) forfiling the motion ex parte , the efforts made to notify parties, and, if the
motion is to shorten time or advance a hearing pursuant to subsection (g)(5)of this Rule, the efforts made to obtain a stipulation or response from the
other parties in the case or the reason(s) why no attempt was made; (3) be
accompanied by a proposed order; and (4) be served on the date that themotion was presented to the court.").

10 may granted [sic] the proposed Divorce Decree submitted and 
filed by [JK]." 
The Ex Parte Order's notification that there is a 
"status hearing" on a motion to compel discovery lacked explanation of its significance, as it did not inform Self-Represented DK that the "status hearing" may turn into a default judgment hearing.  The warning that the consequence for failure to appear or comply with the discovery request is the court "may granted [sic] the proposed Divorce Decree" -- lacked explanation 
that the family court was referring to a discovery sanction of 
"judgment by default against the disobedient party" under HFCR Rule 37(b)(2)(C).  The record also does not reflect that a document entitled "Proposed Divorce Decree" or "Divorce Decree" was filed by JK as the family court ordered; instead, a differently entitled document, "Judgment Granting Divorce and 
Awarding Child Custody" is inconspicuously attached to a 
separate document, the Order of 5/31/17 Hearing.  Thus, the Ex Parte Order leaves multiple ambiguities as to the adequacy of the notification Self-Represented DK received, due to the "inconspicuous placement" issues and lack of "explanation of its significance."  Pioneer, 507 U.S. at 398.    
Document No. 2:   Order of 5/31/17 Hearing  
The Order of 5/31/17 Hearing is a thirteen-page 
document, and pages 1 and 2 inform Self-Represented DK about what transpired at the hearing she missed, and order Self-Represented DK "to respond to the discovery requests no later than June 13, 2017."  (Emphasis added).  However, the Order is not filed or served until two weeks after this deadline had 
passed.  The Order thus appears obsolete because it is 
impossible to comply with a passed deadline.   
The Order of 5/31/17 Hearing informs Self-Represented 
DK that she must appear at a further hearing on June 27, 2017 at NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʿI REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER
11 10:00 a.m., yet the Order was served on Self-Represented DK's 
P.O. Box on the day of the hearing, making the notice 
nonsensical.   Generating additional confusion, this Order states
the June 27, 2017 hearing is at 10:00 a.m.,  but the first 
document discussed supra, the 6/26/17 EPM to Continue 6/27/17 
Hearing, had a different hearing time of 1:30 p.m . on page one.  
The Order of 5/31/17 Hearing advised Self-Represented 
DK that if she "fails to respond to the discovery requests and fails to appear at the hearing of June 27, 2017," the family 
court "may grant a proposed Divorce Decree submitted to the 
Court by [JK] which is attached hereto as Exhibit 'B'."  For the reasons already set forth supra, this obsolete order's notifications also lack explanation of its significance and the significance of the "Judgment Granting Divorce and Awarding Child Custody" that was attached.  See Pioneer, 507 U.S. at 398.  
Finally, as set forth supra, the only notice of the "proposed 
Divorce Decree" that Self-Represented DK ever received was confusingly placed, attached to this second obsolete document giving notice of a discovery deadline that had passed weeks before.  Thus, the Order of 5/31/17 Hearing, viewed together with the Ex Parte Order, amplifies the ambiguities as to the 
adequacy of the notification Self-Represented DK received.  See 
id.  
4. Self-Represented DK's neglect appears excusable
under a broad, equitable inquiry taking into
account all relevant circumstances.
The Majority applies the Ninth Circuit's equitable 
determination of excusable neglect, that:  "The determination of
what conduct constitutes 'excusable neglect' under Rule 60(b)(1)and similar rules 'is at bottom an equitable one, taking accountof all relevant circumstances surrounding the party's omission.'"  Brandt v. Am. Bankers Ins. Co. of Fla., 653 F.3d    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʿI REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER
12 1108, 1111 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Pioneer, 507 U.S. at 395).  
I agree with this standard but disagree with the conclusion 
reached.  The Brandt standard is the same equitable standard for
"excusable neglect" reaffirmed by the 
Hawai ‘i Supreme Court in 
Eckard Brandes, which the supreme court explained came from  
Pioneer:  
Accordingly, as indicated by the United States Supreme 
Court in Pioneer, 507 U.S. 380, 113 S.Ct. 1489, which was 
cited favorably in Enos, whether "excusable neglect" exists 
is "at bottom an equitable" decision; it is necessary to first determine whether there is "neglect," and, if so, whether the "neglect" is "excusable."  507 U.S. at 393-94, 
113 S.Ct. 1489.  As also noted, with respect to determining 
whether existing "neglect" could be deemed "excusable," Enos expressly adopted the equitable standard set forth by 
the United States Supreme Court in Pioneer, and stated, 
"reasons for failure to comply with a court-ordered 
deadline range from acts of God to a party's choice to 
flout the deadline and ... 'excusable neglect' is not restricted to those circumstances beyond a party's control."  We therefore clarify that, as indicated in [Enos], "excusable neglect" is to be construed pursuant to 
its plain language: "neglect" that is "excusable," which, 
"involve[s] a broad, equitable, inquiry" "taking into account all relevant circumstances surrounding the party's omission."  Pioneer, 507 U.S. at 389, 393-94, 113 S.Ct. 
1489. 
146 Hawai ‘i at 364, 463 P.3d at 1021 (emphases added) (footnote 
omitted).  "[E]quity jurisprudence" is "not bound by the strict 
rules of the common law," but enables a court to "mold its 
decrees to do justice amid all the vicissitudes and intricacies 
of life."  Haw. Ventures, LLC v. Otaka, Inc., 114 Hawai ‘i 438, 
456, 164 P.3d 696, 714 (2007) (quoting Fleming v. Napili Kai, 
Ltd., 50 Haw. 66, 70, 430 P.2d 316, 319 (1967) (internal quotation marks omitted)).  While the principles upon which equity jurisprudence proceeds are "eternal[,] . . . their 
application in a changing world will necessarily change to meet 
changed situations."  Id. 
 In concluding the neglect here was inexcusable, the
Majority relies on Pogia v. Ramos, 10 Haw. App. 411, 876 P.2d  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʿI REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER
13 1342 (1994) and Joaquin v. Joaquin, 5 Haw. App. 435, 698 P.2d 
298 (1985), both of which are distinguishable from this case.  
Pogia involved a self-represented defendant who failed to answer 
a complaint on grounds that she did not understand "'what the legal papers meant,'" and we held that in order to establish "excusable neglect" under HFCR Rule 60(b)(1), a defaulted party "who failed to answer a complaint must make a showing of why the party was justified in failing to respond to the complaint or to obtain an extension of time to respond," and that "'ignorance of 
the law'" was not "excusable neglect."  10 Haw. App. at 416, 876 
P.2d at 1345 (citations omitted).  Unlike the notices Self-Represented DK received here that contained multiple ambiguities in the adequacy of their notification, we noted that the summons in Pogia "clearly sets forth Defendant's obligations to respond within twenty days or have judgment by default taken against 
her."  Id. at 417, 876 P.2d at 1345.  Joaquin involved a 
defendant who had signed a divorce agreement and appearance and waiver without reading them, which we held did not constitute "excusable neglect" under 60(b)(1).  5 Haw. App. at 443, 698 P.2d at 304.  We held there that the defendant "'must make someshowing of why he was justified in failing to avoid mistake or 
inadvertence.  Gross carelessness is not enough.'"  Id. (citing 
11 Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2858 (1973); 7 Moore's Federal Practice § 60.22[2] (1983)).  Here, Self-Represented DK did not sign documents without reading them, and there is "some showing" why DK's neglect may have been excusable due to the multiple ambiguities surrounding the adequacy of the notifications she received.

No. CAAP-16-0000611, 2019 WL 2281248, at *3 (May 29, 2019) 
(SDO), we concluded that relief was warranted under HRCP Rule 
60(b)(1), under circumstances where the Oleksas, who were self-NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʿI REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER
14 represented like DK here, supplied justification for their 
failure to oppose a  motion for summary judgment that 
constituted excusable neglect, where they left on a trip and did 
not receive the motion until after they returned from their trip, which had been unexpectedly lengthened due to a medical emergency.  We explained that: 
[u]nder HRCP Rule 60(b)(1), a party can be granted relief
from judgment where there is a showing of, inter alia,'excusable neglect' that interferes with the fair
dispensation of justice."  Isemoto Contracting Co., Ltd, v.
Andrade, 1 Haw. App. 202, 204, 616 P.2d 1022, 1025 (1980)."HRCP Rule 60(b)(1), . . . exists to remedy somedereliction of the movant in the litigation itself; forexample, failure to answer the complaint, failure to answer

Id. 
Here, Self-Represented DK's failure to comply with the 
discovery order and missing two hearings on the motion to compel 
constituted neglect.  HFCR Rule 60(b)(1) exists to remedy this 
type of dereliction in the litigation by a movant whose neglect is shown to be excusable.  See id.  Applying a "broad, equitable, inquiry taking into account all relevant circumstances surrounding [Self-Represented DK]'s omission[s]," which include her self-represented status, the multiple 
ambiguities surrounding the adequacy of the notification that 
Self-Represented DK received, her personal situation regarding the housing transition and working two jobs, and the financial and logistical challenges she encountered in finding conflict-free replacement counsel on Maui –- in my view, all militate in favor of a conclusion that her neglect was excusable.

P.3d at 714.
5. HFCR Rule 60(b)(1) relief was warranted.
For the reasons explained above, I would conclude that 
relief under HFCR Rule 60(b)(1) was warranted because Self-Represented DK's neglect appeared excusable under a broad, equitable inquiry of the relevant circumstances; and assuming arguendo there was doubt whether her neglect was excusable, our case law counsels that, in the interest of justice, any doubt in 
setting aside a default judgment should be resolved in favor of 
the party seeking relief.  See Wisenbaker, 101 Hawai ‘i at 254, 65
P.3d at 1046.  The record also reflects that the harshest
discovery sanction of default judgment was imposed in this case, where Self-Represented DK's failure to respond did not rise to the level of willful, contemptuous, or opprobrious conduct 
justifying this level of discovery sanction.  See TW, 124 Hawai ‘i 
at 474, 248 P.3d at 240; Weinberg, 123 Hawai ‘i at 77, 229 P.3d at 
1146.  Setting aside the default judgment in this case is also consistent with the public policy favoring disposition of cases 
on their merits.  See Weinberg, 123 Hawai ‘i at 71, 229 P.3d at 
1136; Wisenbaker, 101 Hawai ‘i at 254, 65 P.3d at 1046.  
Accordingly, I would conclude that the family court abused its 
discretion in denying the motion to set aside the default 
judgment.  See LaPeter v. LaPeter, 144 Hawai ‘i 295, 304, 439 P.3d
247, 256 (App. 2019) (reviewing HFCR Rule 60(b) motion for abuse 
of discretion).
