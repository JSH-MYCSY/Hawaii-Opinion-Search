CAROL MANIACI, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CRIMINAL NO. 1CPC-17-0000506) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: 
Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Carol 
Maniaci appeals from the 
"Judgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence" entered by the 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit on September 26, 2018.1 For 
the reasons explained below, we vacate in part the Judgment of 
Conviction and remand for further proceedings consistent with this summary disposition order. 
On April 24, 2017, Maniaci assaulted two Saks Fifth 
Avenue employees who were attempting to detain her after she allegedly shoplifted a handbag from the store. On April 26, 2017, Maniaci was charged by felony information and non-felony complaint with Theft in the Second Degree in violation of Hawaii

Revised Statutes (HRS) § 708-83l(l)(b)2 and two counts of Assault 
in the Third Degree. Only the theft charge is at issue in this 
appeal. 
Jury trial was set for Monday, April 16, 2018. Motions 
in limine were heard on April 13, 2018 (the Friday before trial). When the hearing began, Maniaci orally moved to dismiss. She challenged the sufficiency of the theft charge, citing State v. Gaub, No. CAAP-15-0000547, 2017 WL 213153 (Haw. App. Jan. 18, 2017) (mem.). The circuit court was familiar with the Gaub memorandum opinion, but the deputy prosecuting attorney (DPA) was 
not. The circuit court called a short recess to allow the DPA to 
read the case. 
When proceedings resumed, the State orally moved to 
amend the theft charge. The circuit court granted leave to amend. An amended information and complaint was filed later that day.

On Monday, April 16, before jury selection began, the 
circuit court sua sponte reconsidered its decision: 
So actually the way the State originally charged
[(theft in the second degree)] . . . is correct. 
So I'm going to reconsider my ruling. I'm striking
the amended information filed on April 13th . . . . I'm 
going to reinstate the -- the felony information which wasfiled back on April 26, 2017, because as far as I'mconcerned, it's correct . . . . And I'm going to deny theoriginal defense motion to dismiss on different groundsnow.[

On April 19, 2018, the jury found Maniaci guilty as 
charged on all counts of the original information and complaint. 
The Judgment of Conviction was entered on September 26, 2018. This appeal followed. 
Maniaci raises four points of error. Two are 
dispositive.
1. Maniaci contends that the circuit court erred by 
denying her motion to dismiss, because the felony information failed to set forth all essential elements of the theft charge. This presents a question of law reviewed de novo under the right/wrong standard. State v. Jardine, 151 Hawai# i 96, 99, 508 
P.3d 1182, 1185 (2022). 
Count 1 of the original information alleged: 
On or about April 24, 2017 in the City and County of
Honolulu, State of Hawaii, CAROL MANIACI did conceal or take 
possession  of goods or merchandise , the value of which
exceeds Seven Hundred Fifty Dollars ($750.00), the property
of Saks Fifth Avenue LLC, a store or retail establishment ,
with intent to defraud , thereby committing the offense of
Theft in the Second Degree in violation of Section708-83l(l)(b) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes, and she issubject to sentencing under Section 708-833.5 of the HawaiiRevised Statutes. 
(Emphasis added.) 
HRS § 708-833.5 (Supp. 2016) provides, in pertinent 
part: 
A person convicted of committing theft by means ofshoplifting as defined in section 708-830 shall be sentencedto the following minimum fines[.] 
HRS § 708-830 (2014) provides, in relevant part: 
A person commits theft if the person does any of the
following: 
. . . . 
(8) Shoplifting. 
the oral order, or striking the amended information and complaint. 
The 
parties agree that trial proceeded based upon the original information andcomplaint.

(a) A person conceals or takes possession of
the goods or merchandise of any store orretail establishment, with intent to 
defraud . 
(Emphasis added.) 
"Intent to defraud" is defined as: 
(1) An intent  to use deception to injure another's
interest which has value; or 
(2) Knowledge  by the defendant that the defendant is
facilitating an injury to another's interest which hasvalue. 
HRS § 708-800 (2014) (emphasis added). 
In State v. Shinyama, 101 Hawai# i 389, 391, 69 P.3d 
517, 519 (2003), the supreme court held that 
the "intent to defraud" component of second degree theft byshoplifting, as defined by HRS § 708–800 (1993), prescribestwo alternative means of establishing the state of mindrequisite to the offense of second degree theft byshoplifting, the circuit court plainly erred in failing toinstruct the jury as to the alternative states of mindrequisite to the charged offense. 
Id. at 391, 69 P.3d at 519 (footnote omitted). 
Shinyama concerned an erroneous jury instruction, not 
the sufficiency of a charge. However, in State v. Garcia, 152 
Hawai# i 3, 518 P.3d 1153 (2022), the supreme court held that an 
information that did not define "intent to defraud," did not specify the states of mind for forgery in the second degree, in violation of article I sections 5 and 14 of the 
Hawai# i 
Constitution.5 Id. at 7, 518 P.3d at 1157. Although not stated 
in the supreme court's opinion, the elements of forgery in the second degree at issue in Garcia were: 
5 Article I, section 5 of the Hawai #i Constitution 
(right to due process) and article I, section 14 of
the 
Hawai #i Constitution (right "to be informed of the
nature and cause of the accusation") inspire thecriteria we use to measure the adequacy of a charge:charging documents must include the elements of anoffense and sufficiently describe the nature and causeof the accusation. 
Garcia, 152 Hawai #i at 6, 518 P.3d at 1156 (citation omitted). 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
A person commits the offense of forgery in the second degree
if, with intent to defraud , the person falsely makes,
completes, endorses, or alters a written instrument, orutters a forged instrument, or fraudulently encodes themagnetic ink character recognition numbers, which is orpurports to be, or which is calculated to become or torepresent if completed, a deed, will, codicil, contract,assignment, commercial instrument, or other instrument whichdoes or may evidence, create, transfer, terminate, orotherwise affect a legal right, interest, obligation, orstatus. 
HRS § 708-852(1) (2014) (emphasis added). 
In Garcia, the supreme court held that "[i]ntent is a 
state of mind, not an element." Id. at 7, 518 P.3d at 1157. The 
supreme court then held: 
an intentional state of mind — as HRS § 708-800 makes clear— is not forgery's only state of mind. The intent to defraud element may also be proved if a defendant knowingly"facilitat[es] an injury to another's interest which hasvalue." 
. . . . 
Here, because the information does not define intent
to defraud, and thus does not specify the 
states of mind for
forgery in the second degree, the information violatesarticle I sections 5 and 14 of the Hawai #i Constitution. 
Id. (footnote omitted). 
"Intent to defraud" was also required to prove the 
theft charge against Maniaci. Under Garcia and Shinyama, the 
theft charge against Maniaci should have defined or specified "intent to defraud" — "(1) [a]n intent to use deception to injure another's interest which has value; or (2) [k]nowledge by the defendant that the defendant is facilitating an injury to another's interest which has value." Garcia, 152 Hawai# i at 4, 
518 P.3d at 1154; Shinyama, 101 Hawai# i at 397, 69 P.3d at 525. 
The shoplifting charge against Maniaci did not define or specify "intent to defraud" and thus did not sufficiently allege the applicable states of mind. 
Accordingly, the circuit court erred 
by denying Maniaci's motion to dismiss.
2. We must also address Maniaci's contention that the 
evidence was insufficient to support the jury's finding of guilty on the theft charge. See State v. Davis, 133 Hawai# i 102, 120, 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
324 P.3d 912, 930 (2014) (holding that double jeopardy clause of 
Hawai# i Constitution requires addressing defendant's claim of 
insufficiency of the evidence before remanding for new trial based on defective charge). When reviewing the sufficiency of evidence on appeal, we apply the following deferential standard of review: 
[E]vidence adduced in the trial court must be
considered in the strongest light for the prosecutionwhen the appellate court passes on the legalsufficiency of such evidence to support a conviction;the same standard applies whether the case was beforea judge or jury. The test on appeal is not whetherguilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt, butwhether there was substantial evidence to support theconclusion of the trier of fact. 
State v. Kalaola, 124 Hawai# i 43, 49, 237 P.3d 1109, 1115 (2010) 
(citation omitted). "'Substantial evidence' . . . is credible 
evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion." Id. 
Maniaci argues that a photograph of the handbag with 
its price tag (State's Exhibit 9) and the register receipt for the handbag (State's Exhibit 31) were hearsay, inadmissible to prove the handbag's value. She did not make a hearsay objection at trial. 
Her argument is waived. State v. Crisostomo, 94 
Hawai# i
 282, 290, 12 P.3d 873, 881 (2000) ("A hearsay objection 
not raised or properly preserved in the trial court will not be considered on appeal.") (citation omitted).

6 If Maniaci had objected at trial based on hearsay, her objection
should have been overruled. At the time of Maniaci's alleged offense HRS
§ 708-830(8) (2014) provided, in relevant part: 
The unaltered price or name tag or other marking on goods ormerchandise, duly identified photographs or photocopiesthereof, or printed register receipts shall be prima facieevidence of value and ownership of such goods ormerchandise. Photographs of the goods or merchandiseinvolved, duly identified in writing by the arresting policeofficer as accurately representing such goods ormerchandise, shall be deemed competent evidence of the goodsor merchandise involved and shall be admissible in anyproceedings, hearings, and trials for shoplifting to the

6(...continued)Maniaci also argues that "there was no evidence and/or 
testimony that [she] intended or knew that the value" of the 
handbag exceeded $750, because a Saks Fifth Avenue employee testified that there was no sign with a price where the handbag was displayed, and that "[m]ost of the time" the price tag would "fall inside the bag." However, State's Exhibits 9 and 31 were "prima facie evidence that [Maniaci] believed or knew the [handbag] to be of that value." HRS § 708-801(4) (2014). 
In addition, as the supreme court has explained: 
Given the difficulty of proving the requisite state of mind
by direct evidence in criminal cases, we have consistentlyheld that proof by circumstantial evidence and reasonableinferences arising from circumstances surrounding thedefendant's conduct is sufficient. Thus, the mind of analleged offender may be read from his acts, conduct andinferences fairly drawn from all the circumstances. 
State v. Batson, 73 Haw. 236, 254, 831 P.2d 924, 934 (1992) 
(cleaned up). Evidence was presented that Maniaci removed the handbag — with a black sensor attached to it — from the display stand, went into a fitting room and a restroom, and no handbag was found in the fitting room or restroom after Maniaci left. Maniaci walked past the cashiers and exited the store. When Maniaci was confronted by Saks Fifth Avenue employees outside the store, an object similar to a handbag was felt near Maniaci's waistband. While the employees were escorting Maniaci to the security office, a struggle occurred and a black dust bag containing the handbag fell to the ground. The dust bag is a cloth bag, kept inside the handbag, that protects the handbag from dust, debris, and nicks. Thus, even if the price tag was inside the handbag, a reasonable jury could conclude that Maniaci saw the price tag when she retrieved the dust bag from inside the handbag. The handbag's black sensor was wrapped in aluminum foil. 
same extent as the goods or merchandise themselves. 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
There was substantial evidence from which the jury 
could conclude that Maniaci knew or intended that the value of 
the handbag she shoplifted exceeded $750. Maniaci makes no other arguments about the sufficiency of the evidence. 
Based upon the foregoing, we vacate in part the 
"Judgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence" entered by the circuit court on September 26, 2018, as to Count 1 for shoplifting only, and remand for the circuit court to dismiss Count 1 without prejudice.
