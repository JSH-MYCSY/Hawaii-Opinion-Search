3The trial court entered a "Judgment and Notice of Entry of 
Judgment" (Judgment) on October 18, 2018.  For the reasons 
explained below, we affirm. 
BACKGROUND 
On November 28, 2017, Hawai# i County Police Department 
(
HCPD) officer Casey Cabral, using a Stalker DSR 2X radar device, 
determined that Torres was operating his vehicle on a public road 
at a speed of 94 miles per hour (MPH). Officer Cabral cited 
Torres for excessive speeding and for driving without a license. 
Torres contested the citation. A bench trial was conducted on October 18, 2018. The trial court found Torres guilty. This appeal followed. 
DISCUSSION 
Torres's only contention on appeal is that the State 
failed to lay the proper foundation for admissibility of Officer Cabral's testimony about Torres's speed displayed on his Stalker DSR 2X radar device. "[T]he determination of whether proper foundation has been established lies within the discretion of the trial court, and its determination will not be overturned absent a showing of clear abuse." State v. Gonzalez, 128 Hawai# i 314, 
325, 288 P.3d 788, 799 (2012) (quoting State v. Assaye, 121 Hawai# i 204, 210, 216 P.3d 1227, 1233 (2009)). 
To lay a foundation for the introduction of a radar 
speed measurement, the State must demonstrate that: (1)
 the 
police officer who used the device was trained as required by the device manufacturer; and (2) the device's accuracy was tested 
(...continued)
examined as provided in section 286-108 and duly licensed by
the examiner of drivers: 
. . . . 
(3) Passenger cars of any gross vehicle weightrating, buses designed to transport fifteen orfewer occupants, and trucks and vans having agross vehicle weight rating of eighteen thousandpounds or less[.]

 according to manufacturer-recommended procedures and was 
operating properly prior to use. See Gonzalez, 128 Hawai# i at 
324-27, 288 P.3d at 798-801. 
As to the training prong, the State 
must show (a) what the manufacturer's training requirements were, 
and (b) what training was actually received by the police officer 
operating the device. See State v. Amiral, 132 Hawai# i 170, 178, 
319 P.3d 1178, 1186 (2014) (citing Gonzalez, 128 Hawai# i at 327, 
288 P.3d at 801). 
1. Training 
Officer Cabral testified that he received 16 hours of 
instruction on Doppler-based radar speed detection devices while 
in police recruit training. He received a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration manual, attended classroom instruction, and participated in field training. 
He passed a 
test and was certified to use radar speed detection devices. 
Officer Cabral also testified that the Stalker DSR 2X 
radar is manufactured by Applied Concepts. Officer Cabral testified that he read the manual that came with his assigned Stalker DSR 2X radar. He explained that Applied Concepts does not require users of the Stalker DSR 2X radar to receive formal training; however, in 2014 he received four hours of classroom and field training from an Applied Concepts instructor. The training included instruction on testing and operating the device. 
The evidence before the trial court established that 
although the manufacturer of the radar device did not have specific training requirements, Officer Cabral received training in the use of Doppler-based radar devices while he was in recruit training, and that he received additional training in the testing and operation of the radar from the manufacturer. We hold that the State established foundation for the training prong.

2. Testing 
Officer Cabral testified that on the day he cited 
Torres, he tested and operated his assigned Stalker DSR 2X radar 
according to the contents of the manual that came with the device and the training he received from Applied Concepts. He tests the device before and after each shift. When the device is powered on it conducts a self-test. If it is working properly it emits a "happy beep" and the display shows three 8s. If it is not working properly it will beep 20 times and the display will show "Fail." He then tests the device using two tuning forks that come with the device, one for 25 MPH and one for 40 MPH. He taps the tuning fork on a non-metallic surface and places it two inches in front of the antenna. He tests the front and rear antennae. Officer Cabral testified that his radar tested properly before and after his shift on the day he cited Torres. 
In State v. Tailo, 70 Haw. 580, 779 P.2d 11 (1989), the 
supreme court held: 
A special tuning fork can be used to check the calibration
of the radar gun . The tuning fork is specially tuned to
vibrate at a frequency equal to the Doppler frequency forsome set speed stamped into the handle of the fork. To test the accuracy of the radar gun with the fork, the officerstrikes the fork to get it vibrating and then holds the forkin front of the radar head. The radar unit will then read the fork's vibration and display the read Doppler frequencyvalue for comparison by the officer with the imprinted valueon the fork. . . . 
. . . . 
. . . [W]e hold that once the State puts in evidence that
the police conducted a tuning fork test indicating the[radar] gun was properly calibrated, this evidence creates aprima facie presumption that the tuning fork itself wasaccurately calibrated . 
Id. at 583, 779 P.2d at 13-14 (emphasis added). In this case 
Officer Cabral conducted a tuning fork test indicating that his radar was operating properly on the date he cited Torres. Torres produced no evidence to rebut the prima facie presumption that the tuning forks were accurately calibrated. We hold that the State established foundation for the testing prong.

CONCLUSION 
Based upon the foregoing, we hold that the trial court 
did not abuse its discretion by admitting Officer Cabral's radar 
measurement of the speed of Torres's vehicle into evidence. Accordingly, the "Judgment and Notice of Entry of Judgment" filed on October 18, 2018, is affirmed.
