APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 18-1-0635-04 (DEO)) 
ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL 
(By: Reifurth, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of the Stipulation for Dismissal of 
Appeal, filed April 18, 2019, by Plaintiff-Appellant Star-
Beachboys, Inc., the papers in support, and the record, it 
appears that (1) the appeal has been docketed; (2) the parties 
stipulate to dismiss the appeal under 
Hawai# i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 42(b); (3) the stipulation is dated and signed by counsel for all parties appearing in the appeal; and NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(4) HRAP Rule 42(b) requires parties to specify the terms as to 
payment of costs, which the instant stipulation fails to do. 
Nonetheless, the court will construe the instant stipulation as a 
motion to dismiss the appeal, under HRAP Rule 42(b), and grant 
the requested relief. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion to 
dismiss the appeal is granted, and the appeal is dismissed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, April 24, 2019.
