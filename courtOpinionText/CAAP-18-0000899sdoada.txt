APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1CC15000330) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: 
Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka and Nakasone, JJ.) 
Kirk Lankford , representing himself, appeals from the 
Judgment entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit on 
November 23, 2018.  He challenges the circuit court's order 
granting the defendants' motion to dismiss his complaint, entered on June 3, 2016. We affirm. 1
In 2008 Lankford was convicted of Murder in the Second 
Degree in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes § 707-701.5. State v. Lankford, No. 29287, 2011 WL 1836716, at *1 (Haw. App. 
1 The Honorable Virginia Lea Crandall presided.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
May 13, 2011) (mem.), cert. rejected , SCWC–29287, 2011 WL 4552995 
(Haw. Oct. 4, 2011). He was sentenced to life in prison with the 
possibility of parole. Id. 
Lankford filed a complaint with the circuit court on 
February 25, 2015. He claimed that the City and County of Honolulu Department of the Prosecuting Attorney and four of its attorneys (collectively, the City) violated 42 U.S.C. § 1983. He 
also asserted state law tort claims. 
The City removed the case to federal court. The 
federal court dismissed the federal claims, declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims, and remanded the case to the circuit court. 
Back in state court, the City moved to dismiss the 
remaining claims. The circuit court granted the motion and entered the Judgment. This appeal followed. 
Lankford's tort claims against the City are based on 
conduct connected with his sentencing by the circuit court and his minimum sentence proceeding before the 
Hawai#i Paroling 
Authority. Neither Lankford's conviction nor his sentence have been vacated. A criminal defendant who has failed to overturn their conviction cannot maintain a civil tort lawsuit based on claims that necessarily imply the invalidity of the conviction. Penaflor v. Mossman, 141 Hawai #i 358, 364, 409 P.3d 762, 768 
(App. 2017); Heck v. Humphrey , 512 U.S. 477, 484-86 (1994). 
The 
circuit court did not err by dismissing Lankford's complaint. 
The "Judgment" entered by the circuit court on 
November 23, 2018, is affirmed.
