IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI #I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
ALFRED NAPAHUELUNA SPINNEY, Defendant-Appellant,
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
NORTH AND SOUTH HILO DIVISION
(CASE NO. 3DCW-17-0003264)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
Upon review of the record of district court criminal
case number 3DCW-17-0003264 and the resulting appeal in appellate
court case number CAAP-18-0000914, it appears that we lack
appellate jurisdiction pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
§ 641-12(a) (2016).  In this appeal, Defendant-Appellant Alfred
Napahueluna Spinney (Spinney), pro se, appeals from the Honorable
M. Kanani Laubach's November 23, 2018 interlocutory order
regarding the forfeiture of Spinney's bail and requiring Spinney
to appear in district court on January 29, 2019, for a bail
forfeiture status hearing, related to Plaintiff-Appellee State of
Hawaii's (the State) December 4, 2017 complaint against Spinney
for criminal contempt of court in violation of HRS § 710-1077
(2014 & Supp. 2017).  Under these circumstances, the dismissal ofNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
this appeal is warranted.
"The right of appeal in a criminal case is purely
statutory[.]"  State v. Nicol, 140 Hawai #i 482, 485, 403 P.3d
259, 262 (2017) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
The Hawai #i Intermediate Court of Appeals has jurisdiction "[t]o
hear and determine appeals from any court or agency when appeals
are allowed by law[.]"  HRS § 602-57(1) (2016).  HRS § 641-12(a)
provides that "[a]ppeals upon the record shall be allowed from
all final decisions and final judgments of district courts in all
criminal matters."  Consequently, "in order to appeal a criminal
matter in the district court, the appealing party must appeal
from a written judgment or order that has been filed with the
clerk of the court pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(b)(3)."  State v.
Bohannon, 102 Hawai #i 228, 236, 74 P.3d 980, 988 (2003); see also
Rule 32(c)(2) of the Hawai# i Rules of Penal Procedure.  
In the instant appeal, the November 23, 2018
interlocutory order is not a final judgment that ends the
proceedings, and, thus, it is not independently appealable under
HRS § 641-12(a).  Instead, the November 23, 2018 interlocutory
order will be eligible for appellate review by way of a timely
appeal from a future appealable final judgment under the
principle that, "[a]s a general rule, an appeal from a final
judgment in a case brings up for review all preceding
interlocutory orders in the case."  State v. Adam, 97 Hawai #i
475, 482, 40 P.3d 877, 884 (2002) (citations omitted).  The
district court has not yet entered a final judgment on the
State's original December 4, 2017 complaint for criminal contempt
of court in violation of HRS § 710-1077, and, thus, we lack
appellate jurisdiction over this appeal.
We further note that although the November 23, 2018
order forfeits $150 in cash bail, it is not an order denying a
request to set aside a bail forfeiture judgment. Thus, this
appeal is not authorized under HRS § 804-51.

Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
case number CAAP-18-0000914 is dismissed for lack of appellate
jurisdiction.
