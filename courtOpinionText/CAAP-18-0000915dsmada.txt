IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI #I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
ALFRED NAPAHUELUNA SPINNEY, Defendant-Appellant,
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
NORTH AND SOUTH HILO DIVISION
(CASE NO. 3DCW-17-0003264)
ORDER DISMISSING APPELLATE COURT CASE NUMBER
CAAP-18-0000915 FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
Upon review of the record of district court criminal
case number 3DCW-17-0003264 and the resulting appeal in appellate
court case number CAAP-18-0000915, it appears that we lack
appellate jurisdiction pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
§ 641-12(a) (2016).  Defendant-Appellant Alfred Napahueluna
Spinney (Spinney), pro se, appeals from the Honorable M. Kanani
Laubach's November 15, 2018 interlocutory order requiring Spinney
to appear in district court on November 23, 2018, and imposing a
deadline of November 19, 2018, for exhibits, witnesses, and
motions with respect to the future trial on Plaintiff-Appellee
State of Hawaii's (the State) December 4, 2017 complaint against
Spinney for criminal contempt of court in violation of HRS § 710-
1077 (2014 & Supp. 2017).  Under these circumstances, dismissal
of the appeal is warranted.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
"The right of appeal in a criminal case is purely
statutory[.]"  State v. Nicol, 140 Hawai #i 482, 485, 403 P.3d
259, 262 (2017) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
The Hawai #i Intermediate Court of Appeals has jurisdiction "[t]o
hear and determine appeals from any court or agency when appeals
are allowed by law[.]"  HRS § 602-57(1) (2016).  HRS § 641-12(a)
provides that "[a]ppeals upon the record shall be allowed from
all final decisions and final judgments of district courts in all
criminal matters."  Consequently, "in order to appeal a criminal
matter in the district court, the appealing party must appeal
from a written judgment or order that has been filed with the
clerk of the court pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(b)(3)."  State v.
Bohannon, 102 Hawai #i 228, 236, 74 P.3d 980, 988 (2003); see also
Rule 32(c)(2) of the Hawai# i Rules of Penal Procedure.
In the instant appeal, the November 15, 2018
interlocutory order is not independently appealable under HRS
§ 641-12(a).  It will be eligible for appellate review after a
timely appeal from a future appealable final judgment under the
principle that, "[a]s a general rule, an appeal from a final
judgment in a case brings up for review all preceding
interlocutory orders in the case."  State v. Adam, 97 Hawai #i
475, 482, 40 P.3d 877, 884 (2002) (citations omitted). The
district court has not yet entered a final judgment on the
State's original December 4, 2017 complaint against Spinney for
criminal contempt of court in violation of HRS § 710-1077, and, 
thus, we lack appellate jurisdiction over this appeal.1
1"Generally, the filing of a notice of appeal divests the trial
court of jurisdiction over the appealed case."  TSA International Limited v.
Shimizu Corporation, 92 Hawai #i 243, 265, 990 P.2d 713, 735 (1999) (citations
omitted).  "The general rule, however, assumes that the notice of appeal is
valid under the applicable statutory provisions and procedural rules.  Where
the notice of appeal is jurisdictionally defective, filing the notice does not
transfer jurisdiction from the trial court to the appellate court." 
Ontiveros, 82 Hawai #i 446, 449, 923 P.2d 388, 391 (1996) (citations omitted;
emphasis added).
