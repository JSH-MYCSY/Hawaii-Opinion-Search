IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
JS, Petitioner-Appellee, v.
JN, Respondent-Appellant,
and
CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT AGENCY,
STATE OF HAWAI#I, Respondent
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(FC-P NO. 16-1-6094)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL 
FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By:  Fujise, Presiding Judge, and Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.)
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
appellate jurisdiction over this appeal by Respondent-Appellant
JN (Mother) from the November 1, 2018 Order Regarding Temporary
Visitation (Temporary Visitation Order) entered in the Family
Court of the First Circuit (Family Court ), because the Family
Court has not yet entered a final judgment, order or decree as
required by Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS ) § 571-54 (2018). 1/
On February 12, 2016, Petitioner-Appellee JS ( Father)
filed a Petition for Paternity or for Custody, Visitation and
Support Orders After Voluntary Establishment of Paternity in FC-P
No. 16-1-6094 against Mother regarding their minor child ( Child). 
On September 22, 2016, the Stipulated Order Regarding Custody,
Visitation, and Support Orders After Voluntary Establishment of
Paternity was entered, which, among other things, established
that Father is the father of Child.

Following a trial on custody and other issues, on
February 23, 2018, the Family Court entered its Decision and
Order After Trial ( Trial Order ), which, among other things: (1)
awarded Father sole legal and physical custody of Child; and (2)
provided for Mother's visitation with Child pursuant to a
schedule to be worked out by the parties.  The Trial Order
further provided that if the parties could not agree on a
visitation schedule, they were each to submit a proposed
visitation schedule to the Family Court. 
On February 16, 2018, Father filed petitions for orders
for protection on behalf of family or household members
(Protection Petitions) against Mother and her now husband
(Husband ) in FC-DA 18-1-0378 and 18-1-0379, resulting in the
issuance of temporary restraining orders ( TROs) against Mother
and Husband.  On July 20, 2018, the Family Court entered an Order
re Visitation and Child Support, in which the court deferred to
any visitation ordered in the TRO cases.  At a hearing on
August 7, 2018, Father voluntarily withdrew the Protection
Petitions.  
By letter dated August 22, 2018, Mother requested a
conference under Rule 16 of the Hawai#i Family Court Rules (Rule
16 conference ) for the purpose of resuming her visitation with
Child pursuant to the Trial Order.  The Rule 16 conference was
held on September 20, 2018, during which the Family Court, as it
later noted in the Temporary Visitation Order, advised the
parties to file appropriate motions regarding visitation.  The
parties also agreed to submit proposed temporary visitation
orders by September 24, 2018.  Based on the parties' submissions,
on November 1, 2018, the Family Court entered the Temporary
Visitation Order, which provided for Mother's visitation with
Child on a graduated basis. 
Meanwhile, on September 26, 2018, Father filed a Motion
for Relief After Judgment or Order and Declaration, requesting a
modification of the terms of Mother's visitation with Child.  In
addition, on November 2, 2018, Mother filed a Motion for Relief
After Judgment or Order and Declaration, requesting a
modification of the terms of Child's legal and physical custody.  
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
It appears that neither motion had been resolved when Mother
filed her notice of appeal from the Temporary Visitation Order on
November 27, 2018, and when the supplemental record on appeal was
filed on March 25, 2019. 
In family court cases, "[a]n interested party,
aggrieved by any order or decree of the court, may appeal to the
intermediate appellate court for review of questions of law and
fact upon the same terms and conditions as in other cases in the
circuit court, and review shall be governed by chapter 602,
except as hereinafter provided."  HRS § 571-54 (2018).  In
circuit courts, HRS § 641-1(a) (2016) authorizes appeals from
"all final judgments, orders, or decrees[.]"  No published
opinion requires a family court to reduce a final order or
decision in a paternity action to a separate judgment.  See,
e.g., In Interest of Doe, 77 Hawai#i 109, 114 n.9, 883 P.2d 30,
35 n.9 (1994) ("We note that, due to the nature of a 'final'
judgment in child custody cases, the requirements for
appealability set forth in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming &
Wright, 76 Hawai# i 115, 869 P.2d 1334 (1994), are inapplicable in
such custody cases.").  Consequently, under HRS § 571-54,
"appeals in family court cases, as in other civil cases, may be
taken only from (1) a final judgment, order, or decree, see HRS
§§ 571-54 (1993) and 641-1(a) (1993), or (2) a certified
interlocutory order.  See HRS § 641-1(b) (1993)."  In re Doe, 96
Hawai#i 272, 283, 30 P.3d 878, 889 (2001); In re Doe, 102 Hawai #i
246, 249 n.4, 74 P.3d 998, 1001 n.4 (2003) (explaining that HRS
§ 641-1(b) applies to family court cases, and, thus, a "[m]inor
could have applied to the family court for certification of the
order denying his motion to suppress evidence").  "Final order
means an order ending the proceedings, leaving nothing further to
be accomplished."  Familian Northwest, Inc. v. Central Pacific
Boiler & Piping, Ltd., 68 Haw. 368, 370, 714 P.2d 936, 937 (1986)
(quoting Gealon v. Keala, 60 Haw. 513, 520, 591 P.2d 621, 626
(1979)) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Here, the Temporary Visitation Order did not finally
determine, and thus end, the proceedings, leaving nothing further
for the Family Court to accomplish.  It appears, for example,
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
that at the commencement of this appeal, there were motions
pending regarding custody and visitation, and the Family Court
had not yet expressly adjudicated the long-term child visitation
issues.  In fact, on December 27, 2018, the court ordered the
parties to take further steps regarding visitation and
contemplated continued discussion by the parties about agreeing
to visitation terms and a private visitation supervisor.  We
note, moreover, that this case does not involve any attempt by a
government entity to infringe on the parties' parental rights by
way of foster custody or the termination of parental rights, but,
instead, involves the resolution of parental rights between two
private parties as to their child.  In addition, none of the
recognized exceptions to the finality requirement apply in this
case.  See Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai# i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702,
704 (1995); Abrams v. Cases, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88
Hawai#i 319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding the three
requirements for the collateral order doctrine); HRS § 641-1(b)
(regarding the requirements for an appeal from an interlocutory
order).  Absent a final judgment, order or decree, Mother's
appeal is premature, and we lack appellate jurisdiction. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
