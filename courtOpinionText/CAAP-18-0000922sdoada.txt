IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
DEUTSCHE BANK NATIONAL TRUST COMPANY AS 
TRUSTEE FOR MORGAN STANLEY ABS CAPITAL I INC. 
TRUST 2006-NC4, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v. 
BLAINE T. YATA, Defendant-Appellant,

BROOKE J.C. RIOPTA; AMBER M. RIOPTA; CASIE A. RIOPTA,
COUNTY OF KAUAI WASTEWATER MANAGEMENT; AND

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 14-1-0185) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Blaine T. Yata (Yata) appeals from 
the November 1, 2018 Order Denying [Yata's] Motion for Rehearing 
and/or Reconsideration of this Court's Decision Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment as Against 
all Defendants and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure (Order 
Denying Reconsideration) (quotation marks deleted) entered by the NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit (Circuit Court).1 Yata also 
challenges the Circuit Court's Findings of Fact; Conclusions of 
Law; Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment as Against All Defendants and for Interlocutory Decree of 
Foreclosure (Foreclosure Decree), and Judgment, both entered on 
July 19, 2018. 
Yata raises a single point of error on appeal, 
contending that Plaintiff-Appellee Deutsche Bank National Trust 
Company, as Trustee for Morgan Stanley ABS Capital I Inc. Trust 
2006-NC4 (Deutsche Bank) failed to establish its standing to 
foreclose against Yata, and therefore, the Circuit Court erred in 
entering the Order Denying Reconsideration, as well as the Foreclosure Decree and Judgment. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve Yata's point of error as follows: 
On April 17, 2018, Deutsche Bank filed Plaintiff's 
Motion for Summary Judgment as Against All Defendants and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure, along with a supporting 
memorandum, declaration and exhibits (Motion for Summary 
Judgment); a hearing was set for May 24, 2018. At the May 24, 
2018 hearing, counsel for Yata appeared and requested a 
1 The Honorable Randal G.B. Valenciano presided. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
continuance to file an opposition, which was granted. Despite 
the continuance, no opposition (or any form of objection) in response to the Motion for Summary Judgment was filed. Neither Yata nor his counsel appeared at the continued hearing on the Motion for Summary Judgment, which was held on June 26, 2018. Accordingly, to the extent that Yata contends – based on hearsay objections that were not raised in response to the Motion for Summary Judgment – that the Circuit Court erred in entering the Foreclosure Decree and Judgment, Yata's arguments are without merit. See generally Price v. AIG Haw. Ins. Co., Inc., 107 
Hawai# i 106, 111, 111 P.3d 1, 6 (2005) (failure to raise 
evidentiary objections to affidavits and exhibits in support of summary judgment can result in waiver of such objections). 
The Circuit Court considered the issue of standing – 
i.e., whether Deutsche Bank established that it had possession of 
the subject note (Note) at the time of the filing of the 
complaint – in conjunction with [Yata's] Motion for Rehearing 
and/or Reconsideration of this Court's Decision Granting [Deutsche Bank's] Motion for Summary Judgment as Against All 
Defendants and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure (Motion 
for Reconsideration) (quotation marks omitted) filed on July 3, 
2018. 
Yata challenges the Circuit Court's Order Denying 
Reconsideration, arguing that Deutsche Bank offered no admissible 
evidence that it possessed the Note at the time it filed the 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
complaint herein, as required under Bank of Am. v. Reyes-Toledo, 
139 
Hawai# i 361, 390 P.3d 1248 (2017), and the Hawai# i Supreme 
Court cases that followed Reyes-Toledo
. 
As discussed in U.S. Bank Tr., N.A. v. Verhagen, 149 
Hawai# i 315, 325, 489 P.3d 419, 429 (2021), the "[t]estimony of a 
witness with personal knowledge of a document may establish the foundation necessary" to satisfy the authentication requirements 
of Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 901. In Verhagen, the 
supreme court further explained: 
[R]ecords received from another business and incorporated
into the receiving business' records may in somecircumstances be regarded as created by the receivingbusiness. [Thus,] when a record is treated as created bythe receiving business, a person is qualified toauthenticate it if the person has enough familiarity withthe record-keeping system of the business that created the
record, i.e. , the receiving or incorporating business.
Accordingly, a person may be qualified to authenticate an
incorporated record even if the person lacks familiaritywith the records or record-keeping practices of the entitythat actually created the record. 
Id. at 325, 489 P.3d at 429 (cleaned up). 
The supreme court pointed to the importance of 
considering whether records created by the other business were 
incorporated into the loan servicer's own records and were not merely in the servicer's custody, in particular where there is testimony from the servicer's custodian or witness qualified to testify about its records that: the servicer incorporated and kept the documents in the normal course of business; the servicer typically relies upon the accuracy of the contents of the documents; and the circumstances otherwise indicate the 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
trustworthiness of the documents. Id. at 326, 489 P.3d at 430 
(citation omitted). 
Here, with the Motion for Summary Judgment, Deutsche 
Bank submitted, inter alia, a declaration of Matthew Mountes 
(Mountes), Second Assistant Vice President of Specialized Loan 
Servicing LLC (SLS), loan servicer for Deutsche Bank; and in 
conjunction with its response to the Motion for Reconsideration, 
Deutsche Bank submitted, inter alia, a declaration of Mark 
McCloskey (McCloskey), Assistant Vice President of SLS, both 
attesting to their personal review and knowledge of SLS's 
records, including incorporated records. With careful consideration of the supreme court's directives in Verhagen, and upon review of the evidence presented by Deutsche Bank, we conclude that Mountes and McCloskey were qualified witnesses with personal knowledge of SLS's procedures for creating its records, including its procedures for incorporation of records of other businesses into SLS's records, and SLS's reliance on those records and maintenance of those records in the course of its regularly-conducted business activities, after a pre-incorporation process of quality control and verification procedures. Although indicia of trustworthiness are not profuse, we conclude that the record provides sufficient indicia of trustworthiness, including with respect to the evidence that the Note was in the possession of Deutsche Bank, through its custodian Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, at the time the 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
foreclosure complaint was filed. Thus, we conclude that the 
Circuit Court did not err or abuse its discretion in denying the Motion for Reconsideration and rejecting Yata's argument that Deutsche Bank did not have standing to foreclose on the subject property. 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's November 1, 2018 
Order Denying Reconsideration and its July 19, 2018 Foreclosure Decree and Judgment are affirmed.
