WILLIAM FORESMAN, a single man, 
Plaintiff/Counterclaim Defendant-Appellee, v. 
JOHN FORESMAN, a single man, 
Defendant/Counterclaim Plaintiff-Appellant. 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1CC16-1-000705) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.)
 
Defendant/Counterclaim Plaintiff-Appellant John 
Foresman (Uncle
) appeals from the Circuit Court of the First 
Circuit's November 28, 2018 Final Judgment awarding 
Plaintiff/Counterclaim Defendant-Appellee William Foresman 
(Nephew) $50,000.00 in general damages and $200,000.00 in 
punitive damages, in accordance with a jury verdict.1 
1 The Honorable Keith K. Hiraoka presided.   
 
 
   Nephew sued Uncle for civil damages under Hawaiʻ i 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 657-1.8 (2016),2 asserting Uncle 
sexually molested him between 1975 and 1976, when Nephew was 
approximately 7 and 8 years old, and Uncle was approximately 15 
and 16 years old. 
  The gravamen of Uncle's appeal challenges HRS § 657-
1.8 as unconstitutional for imposing punishment for acts 
committed in 1975 and 1976, despite those acts not constituting 
criminal offenses at the time.  See Peugh v. United States, 569 3

2 HRS § 657- 1.8 allows for "[a] civil cause of action for the sexual 
abuse of a minor . . . based upon sexual acts that constituted or would have 
constituted a criminal offense under part V or VI of [HRS] chapter 707." 
3 Uncle raises five points of error on appeal: 
(1) HRS § 657- 1.8 is an unconstitutional ex post facto law under 
article I, section 10, clause I of the United States Constitution; 
(2) HRS § 657- 1.8 is an unconstitutional ex post facto law under the 
Hawaiʻi Constitution; 
(3) HRS § 657- 1.8 is unconstitutional as it deprives persons of life, 
liberty, or property without due process of law as required under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; 
(4) HRS § 657- 1.8 is unconstitutional as it deprives persons of life, 
liberty, or property without due process of law as required under 
article I, section 5 of the Hawaiʻ i Constitution; and 
(5) the circuit court erred in instructing the jury to determine 
civil sexual abuse claims based on the elements of subsequently 
enacted crimes. 
 All these points turn on whether HRS  § 657-1.8 violates the United 
States Constitution's prohibition against ex post facto  laws.  
 Uncle contends HRS § 657- 1.8 violates due process under the United 
States and Hawaiʻi Constitutions solely  because it violates the prohibition  
(continued . . .)

U.S. 530, 532–33 (2013) ("The Constitution forbids the passage 
of ex post facto laws, a category [including] '[e]very law that 
changes the punishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than 
the law annexed to the crime, when committed.'") (quoting Calder 
v. Bull, 3 U.S. 386, 390 (1798)). Nephew argues, inter alia, 
Uncle failed to raise an ex post facto challenge below and 
failed to submit instructions he claims to have been entitled.  
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to the issues raised and the arguments advanced by the parties, we 
affirm. 
  (1) We first address Nephew's waiver arguments. 
Nephew argues Uncle waived his constitutional challenge by failing to expressly argue to the circuit court that HRS § 657-
1.8 violates the ex post facto clause. However, Uncle objected 
to the approved jury instructions on the basis that his 
liability would turn on elements of crimes which did not exist 
(. . . continued) 
against ex post facto  laws. Moreover, the Hawaiʻ i Constitution does not 
contain its own ex post facto clause; it bars ex post facto  measures by 
virtue of its prohibition against "legislation not inconsistent with . . . 
the Constitution of the United States." Hawaiʻi Const. art. III, § 1; State 
v. Guidry, 105 Hawaiʻi 222, 236, 239, 96 P.3d 242, 256, 259 (2004). Lastly, 
Uncle provided no discernable argument on Point 5; thus, we deem it waived, or at a minimum, subsumed within the ex post facto  argument. See  Hawaiʻi 
Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(7); Hawaii Ventures, LLC v. Otaka, Inc., 114 Hawaiʻ i 438, 472 n.17, 164 P.3d 696, 730 n.17 (2007).

at the time of the incident, violating "fundamental fairness" 
under "the Constitution." The United States Supreme Court has 
observed the ex post facto clause "safeguards 'a fundamental 
fairness interest . . . in having the government abide by the 
rules of law it establishes to govern the circumstances under 
which it can deprive a person of his or her liberty or life.'" 
Peugh, 569 U.S. at 544 (emphasis added) (quoting Carmell v.
Texas, 529 U.S. 513, 533 (2000)). Thus, Uncle's objection sufficiently preserved the ex post facto issue. 
Nephew also argues Uncle invited the error by not 
supplying the circuit court with a form of special jury 
instructions containing elements of sexual abuse crimes in 
effect at the time of the incidents. However, after the circuit 
court indicated it would submit Nephew's proposed instructions 
to the jury, Uncle objected, stating the crimes referenced in 
the jury instructions "should be the ones that are defined as of 
the date of the alleged incident." Thus, Uncle did not agree to the portion of the instructions now being contested, nor did he 
leave his objection unspoken. See Moyle v. Y & Y Hyup Shin
Corp.
, 116 Hawaiʻ i 388, 397, 173 P.3d 535, 544 (App. 2007), 
vacated on other grounds, 118 Hawaiʻi 385, 191 P.3d 1062 (2008). 
(2) 
Next, Uncle contends HRS § 657-1.8 violates the ex 
post facto clause because it imposes a punishment for acts 
committed in 1975 and 1976, even though they did not constitute 
4   
 
 
   
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
criminal offenses at that time. He argues: (1) sexual assault 
was not a crime in 1975 and 1976, and the similar crimes of 
first and second degree rape under HRS §§ 707-730 (1976) and 
707-731 (1976) required that a male engage in sexual intercourse 
or sexual contact with a female; (2) indecent exposure was a 
crime in 1975 and 1976, but the then-existing version under HRS 
§ 707-738 (1976) required additional proof of "intent to gratify 
sexual desire"; (3) continuous sexual assault of a minor was not a crime in 1975 and 1976, and the similar crime of first degree 
sexual abuse under HRS § 707-736 (1976) required proof of 
"intent to gratify sexual desire"; and (4) Nephew is not a 
female, and the jury was not instructed on "intent to gratify 
sexual desire." 
Uncle further contends liability is a form of 
punishment under United States v. Reisinger, 128 U.S. 398 
(1888), and that "[c]reating liability for a past act that did 
not impose liability at the time of it's [sic] alleged commission inflicts greater punishment then when committed." 
Citing DeVeau v. Braisted, 363 U.S. 144 (1960), he argues the 
determining factor is whether the "legislative aim was to 
punish" an individual for past activity, rather than as a 
restriction incident to regulation of a present situation. 
The ex post facto clause pertains to statutes with a 
punitive intent, whether classified as criminal or civil. See
5   
 
 
   
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Smith v. Doe, 538 U.S. 84, 95 (2003). "If the intention of the 
legislature was to impose punishment, that ends the inquiry. 
If, however, the intention was to enact a regulatory scheme that 
is civil and nonpunitive," then the court determines whether the 
statute's punitive effect overcomes any nonpunitive intent. 
Smith, 538 U.S. at 92. 
HRS § 657-1.8 is not part of Hawaii's penal code, and 
the legislature has expressly indicated its purpose is "to provide victims of sexual abuse a fair chance to bring a civil 
action against an individual or entity." S. Stand. Comm. Rep. 
No. 2473, in 2012 Senate Journal, at 1033, 
https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/journal/senate/2012/Senate_Journa 
l_2012_Committee_Reports.pdf [https://perma.cc/MD49-EDBM]. 
Thus, legislative intent was not punitive. 
As to whether the statute's punitive effect overcomes 
any nonpunitive intent, we apply the seven factors set out in 
Kennedy v. Mendoza–Martinez, 372 U.S. 144 (1963), and conclude: 
(1) creating a civil cause of action for victims of 
sexual abuse of a minor does not involve an 
affirmative disability or restraint; 
(2) allowing for or extending the time for a civil cause of action has not been historically 
regarded as a punishment; 
6   
 
 
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(3) because claims against persons turn on whether 
the acts committed would have constituted 
criminal offenses, it appears that scienter is a 
requirement; 
(4) permitting a cause of action for damages for criminal behavior arguably promotes traditional 
aims of punishment-retribution and deterrence; 
(5) the behavior to which it applies is already a 
crime; 
(6) the alternative purpose of providing opportunity for compensation for a victim is clearly 
assignable; and 
(7) providing a cause of action—which may not ultimately result in an award—does not appear 
excessive in relation to the purpose of providing 
an opportunity for a sex abuse victim to obtain 
compensation. 
See 372 U.S. at 168-69; State v. Guidry, 105 Hawaiʻ i 222, 235-36, 
96 P.3d 242, 255-56 (2004). 
Factors (3), (4) and (5) weigh in favor of an ex post 
facto violation, and the remaining four factors weigh against. Therefore, "it cannot be said that [Uncle] has provided the 
'clearest proof' that the statutory scheme is so punitive it has 
negated the State's remedial purpose." Guidry

236, 96 P.3d at 256. Consequently, Uncle fails to show that the 
statute violates the federal ex post facto clause.4 
Accordingly, we affirm the circuit court's 
November 28, 2018 Final Judgment.

Carlisle
, 113 Hawaiʻi 446, 456, 153 P.3d 1131, 1141 (2007), this summary 
disposition order shall not be construed as affirmatively determining that 
HRS § 657- 1.8 does not violate the ex post facto clause, but only that Uncle 
has failed to demonstrate otherwise in this appeal.
