BASSETT SERVICES, INC., Employer-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD 
(CASE NO. AB 2018-061) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL 
(By:  Reifurth, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that: 
(1) On December 7, 2018, Claimant-Appellant George Y. 
Chow, Jr. (Chow), pro se, conventionally filed the notice of appeal with the Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board 
(LIRAB); 
(2) On December 13, 2018, the LIRAB clerk 
electronically filed the notice of appeal, which created appeal 
number CAAP-18-0000947; 
(3)
Chow failed to pay the appellate filing and 
docketing fees with the notice of appeal, as required by Hawai# i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 3(a); 
(4) On December 14, 2018, the LIRAB clerk notified Chow 
to pay the filing fees by January 2, 2019, or request a fee waiver, otherwise the clerk is not required to prepare the record 
on appeal.  See HRAP Rule 11(b)(2); NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(5) On May 15, 2019, the appellate clerk entered a 
default of the record on appeal, informing Chow that the time to 
docket the appeal expired on February 11, 2019, he had not paid 
the filing fee or obtained an order allowing him to proceed on 
appeal in forma pauperis, the matter would be brought to the 
court's attention on May 28, 2019, for action that may include 
dismissal of the appeal, and he could seek relief from default by 
motion; 
(6) Chow took no further action in this appeal; and 
(7) An appeal may be dismissed where the record on 
appeal has not been prepared because the appellant failed to pay the required fees or obtain an order allowing the appellant to 
proceed in forma pauperis.  HRAP Rule 11(b)(2), (c)(2). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed.
