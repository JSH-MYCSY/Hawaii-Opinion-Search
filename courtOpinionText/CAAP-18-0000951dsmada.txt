GALINA OGEONE, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
DENIST LESLIE AU, Defendant-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 18-1-0076) 
ORDER 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of the following motions filed by 
Plaintiff-Appellant Galina Ogeone (Ogeone), pro se: (1) "Motion 
to Consolidate Appeals CAAP-180000951 [sic], CAP-18-0000190 
[sic]," filed December 20, 2018, in case number CAAP-18-0000190 
(December 20, 2018 motion in case number CAAP-18-0000190), 
(2) "Motion to Extend Time to File Amended Statement of 
Jurisdiction," filed December 26, 2019, in case number CAAP-18-
0000190 (December 26, 2018 motion in case number CAAP-18-
0000190), (3) "Motion to Decide on Appellant's Motions and on 
Appellant's Case," filed January 22, 2019, in case number CAAP-
18-0000190 (January 22, 2019 motion in case number CAAP-18-
0000190), (4) "Motion to Consolidate Appeals CAAP-180000951 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
[sic], CAP-18-0000190 [sic]," filed December 21, 2018, in case 
number CAAP-18-0000951 (December 21, 2018 motion in case number 
CAAP-18-0000951), (5) "Exparte [sic] Motion for Leave to Proceed 
on Appeal In Forma Pauperis," filed December 26, 2018, in case 
number CAAP-18-0000951, (6) "Motion to Decide on Appellant's 
Motions," filed January 29, 2019, in case number CAAP-18-0000951, 
(7) "Motion to Cancel Deadlines for Filing Appellant's Statement 
of Jurisdiction, Opening Brief, and Deadline for Filing Record on 
Appeal," filed January 31, 2019, in case number CAAP-18-0000951; 
the papers in support, the record in case numbers CAAP-18-0000190 
and CAAP-18-0000951, and there being no opposition to the 
motions, it appears that: 
(1)
 In the December 20, 2018 Motion in case number 
CAAP-18-0000190 and the December 21, 2018 motion in case number 
CAAP-18-0000951, Ogeone seeks to consolidate the appeals in case 
numbers CAAP-18-0000190 and CAAP-18-0000951; 
(2) In case number CAAP-18-0000190, Ogeone appeals from 
the circuit court's February 22, 2018 order denying her motion 
for leave to file a complaint against Defendant-Appellee Dentist 
Leslie Au in Civil No. 18-1-0076. On November 29, 2018, the 
court in case number CAAP-18-0000190 temporarily remanded the 
case to the circuit court with instructions to enter an 
appealable final judgment, consistent with Waikiki v. Ho# omaka 
Village Ass'n of Apartment Owners, 140 Hawai# i 197, 398 P.3d 786 
(2017). In compliance with the November 29, 2018 order, the 
circuit court entered a final judgment on December 12, 2018, and 
the circuit court clerk filed a supplemental record on appeal 
that included the final judgment on December 24, 2018. On 
December 14, 2018, Ogeone filed a notice of appeal from the 
December 12, 2018 final judgment, which created case number CAAP-
18-0000951. The appeal in case number CAAP-18-0000951 is 
duplicative and unnecessary, because the court will review the 
December 12, 2018 final judgment when it considers the appeal in 
case number CAAP-18-0000190 on the merits. The court will sua 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
sponte dismiss the appeal in case number CAAP-18-0000951, making 
the motions for consolidation moot; 
(3) In the December 26, 2018 motion in case number 
CAAP-18-0000190, Ogeone seeks a first extension of time for the 
amended statement of jurisdiction required by the November 29, 
2018 order, due to her illness; 
(4) There appears to be good cause to grant an 
extension; 
(5) In the January 22, 2019 motion in case number CAAP-
18-0000190, Ogeone requests the court to decide her "case" and 
the pending motions in case number CAAP-18-0000190; 
(6)
 With this order, the court has decided all pending 
motions in case number CAAP-18-0000190, and it will decide her 
appeal in that case as soon as practicable; 
(7) In case number CAAP-18-0000951, Ogeone filed on 
December 26, 2018, a motion for leave to proceed on appeal in 
forma pauperis, on January 29, 2019, a motion to decide her 
pending motions, and on January 31, 2019, a motion to cancel 
certain deadlines; and 
(8) Because the court will dismiss the appeal in case 
number CAAP-18-0000951, it will also dismiss all pending motions 
in that appeal. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal in case 
number CAAP-18-0000951 is dismissed as unnecessary, and all 
pending motions are dismissed. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the December 20, 2018 motion 
in appeal number CAAP-18-0000190 is denied as moot. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the December 26, 2018 motion 
in case number CAAP-18-0000190 is granted. Within ten days from 
the date of this order, Ogeone shall file the amended statement 
of jurisdiction required by the November 29, 2018 order in case 
number CAAP-18-0000190. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the January 22, 2019 motion 
in case number CAAP-18-0000190 is denied as follows: 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(1) The request to decide certain motions is denied as 
moot. 
(2) The request to decide the "case" is denied but the 
court will enter a decision on the merits of the appeal as soon 
as practicable. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the appellate clerk shall 
file this order in case numbers CAAP-18-0000190 and CAAP-18-
0000951.
