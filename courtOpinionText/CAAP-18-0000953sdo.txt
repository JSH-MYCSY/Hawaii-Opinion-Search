 on claims of violations of the Hawaiʻ i Whistleblower Protection 
Act codified in Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 378-62 (2015). 
On appeal, Windham contends the circuit court "abused 
its discretion in granting summary judgment" as "[t]here were 
issues of fact remaining."3 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve this appeal as discussed below. 
We review the circuit court's grant of summary 
judgment de novo.  Dairy Rd. Partners v. Island Ins. Co., Ltd., 
92 Hawaiʻ i 398, 411, 992 P.2d 93, 106 (2000). 
HRS § 378-62 protects employees who report suspected 
violations of the law: 
§378-62 Discharge of, threats to, or discrimination against 
employee for reporting violations of the law. 
An employer shall not discharge, threaten, or otherwise 
discriminate against an employee regarding the employee's compensation, terms, conditions, location, or privileges of employment because: 
  
 
3  Windham also challenges numerous findings and conclusions made by the 
circuit court.  However, we need not address these challenges because "a 
trial court deciding a motion for summary judgment doesn't make findings on 
disputed material facts."   See Drummond v. Cho, 153 Hawaiʻ i 143, 527 P.3d 479, 
CAAP-19-0000094, 2023 WL 3017219, *1 n.4 (App. April 20, 2023) (SDO); 
Alexander & Baldwin, Inc. v. Silva, 124 Hawaiʻ i 476, 480- 81, 248 P.3d 1207, 
1211-12 (App. 2011). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

      (1)  The employee, or a person acting on behalf of the 
employee, reports or is about to report to the employer, or 
reports or is about to report to a public body, verbally or in writing, a violation or a suspected violation of: 
          (A)  A law, rule, ordinance, or regulation, 
adopted pursuant to law of this State, a political 
subdivision of this State, or the United States; or 
          (B)  A contract executed by the State, a 
political subdivision of the State, or the United States, 
unless the employee knows that the report is false; or 
     (2)  An employee is requested by a public body to 
participate in an investigation, hearing, or inquiry held 
by that public body, or a court action. 
(Formatting altered.) 
As we have stated in prior cases, an employee making 
an HRS § 378-62 claim must prove: 
(1) [she] engaged in protected conduct under [HRS § 378-62], 
(2) the employer took an adverse employment action against the 
employee, and (3) a causal connection exists between the 
employee's protected conduct and the employer's adverse action (i.e., the employer's action was taken because the employee engaged in the protected conduct; the employee has the burden of 
showing that the protected conduct was a " substantial or 
motivating factor" in the employer's decision to take the 
employment action). 
 
Fukumoto v. State, 150 Hawaiʻ i 467, 504 P.3d 1055, CAAP-16-
0000785, 2022 WL 591775, at *2 (App. Feb. 28, 2022) (mem. op.); 
see Crosby v. State Dep't of Budget & Fin., 76 Hawaiʻ i 332, 341-
42, 876 P.2d 1300, 1309-10 (1994). 
The State, as the movant, bore the initial burden of 
establishing entitlement to 
summary judgment.  See Ralston v. 
Yim, 129 Hawaiʻ i 46, 59-61, 292 P.3d 1276, 1289-91 (2013).  A 
defendant moving for summary judgment "may satisfy his or her 
initial burden of production by either (1) presenting evidence NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 negating an element of the non-movant's claim, or 
(2) demonstrating that the nonmovant will be unable to carry his or her burden of proof at trial."  Id. at 60, 292 P.3d at 1290.  
In other words, the movant's "burden may be discharged by demonstrating that if the case went to trial, there would be no competent evidence to support a judgment for his or her 
opponent."  Kondaur Cap. Corp. v. Matsuyoshi, 136 Hawaiʻ i 227, 
240, 361 P.3d 454, 467 (2015) (cleaned up). 
In its motion for summary judgment, the State 
acknowledged that some of Windham's actions constituted 
protected conduct.  But the State argued that Windham could not 
meet her burden of showing she suffered adverse employment action or establish causal connection between her protected conduct and the alleged retaliation.  Finally, the State argued that even if Windham was able to meet her burden, the State's actions were based on legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons. 
To support these arguments, the State attached 
declarations from Espinda, Jodie Maesaka-Hirata, Alan Asato 
(Asato), and Colleen Miyasato.  The State also attached other 
documents including transcripts of Windham's deposition, the position description for the Corrections Program Specialist II position, a December 11, 2014 email from Windham with the NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 heading "CONFIDENTIAL for FEAR of RETALIATION", and information 
regarding office space standards. 
Even if we were to assume the State met its burden, 
Windham responded by "setting forth specific facts showing that 
there is a genuine issue for trial."  Kondaur, 136 Hawaiʻ i at 
240-41, 361 P.3d at 467-68 (cleaned up). 
In response to the State's argument that she could not 
show adverse employment action
, Windham claimed among other 
things that she was moved from an office to a storage closet, 
singled out to follow a list of workplace behaviors, and was 
stripped of duties.  Examined in light most favorable to 
Windham, these actions could be construed as "adverse employment action[s]."  See Fukumoto, 2022 WL 591775, at *9 ("[A]n action 
is cognizable as an adverse employment action if it is reasonably likely to deter employees from engaging in protected activity.") (quoting Black v. Correa, Civil No. 07-00299 DAE-
LEK, 2008 WL 3845230 at *11 (D. Haw. Aug. 18, 2008)). 
In response to the State's argument that she could not 
show causation, Windham notes that on June 15, 2015, she filed her complaint in circuit court and on July 28, 2015, she reported to Asato "problems with the 'new' timesheet . . . , employees not working 8 hours, but getting paid, Ms. [G] frequently surfing the internet, extended 2-3 hour lunch breaks, NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 the 'Lunch Bunch' that Deputy Director Asato belonged to."   
Then, on August 12, 2015, Asato presented Windham with a list of behavior issues she must address.  Examined again in the light most favorable to Windham, the temporal proximity of these events raises a question of fact as to causation.  See Dobbs v. 
Cnty. of Maui, 144 Hawaiʻ i 61, 434 P.3d 1256, CAAP-16-0000577, 
2019 WL 762407, at *4 (App. Feb. 20, 2019) (SDO) (noting a "circumstantial case" can be established by demonstrating temporal proximity between an adverse employment action and protected conduct known to employer). 
The State points out that an employee's prima facie 
case
 may be overcome by articulating a "legitimate, 
nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action."   
Shoppe v. Gucci Am., Inc., 94 Hawaiʻ i 368, 378, 14 P.3d 1049, 
1059 (2000).  The State offered several ostensibly legitimate 
reasons for their actions.  For example, Asato explained that the August 12, 2015 meeting was to encourage Windham "to stay focused on her job duties/responsibilities, and not to worry about the duties/responsibilities of her co-workers."   Similarly, the State used its internal space standards to justify relocating Windham's workspace.

 However, under the McDonnell Douglas framework, an 
employee may rebut the employer's nondiscriminatory reasons as 
pretext.  McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 804-05 
(1973); Adams v. CDM Media USA, Inc., 135 Hawaiʻ i 1, 14, 346 P.3d 
70, 83 (2015).  Here, the temporal proximity of the State's actions constitutes a genuine issue as to whether the State's provided reasons were a pretext to punish Windham.  See 
Fukumoto, 2022 WL 591775, at *11 ("In some cases, temporal 
proximity can by itself constitute sufficient circumstantial evidence of retaliation for purposes of both the prima facie 
case and the showing of pretext.") (citation omitted).  In other 
words, based on the record before this court, the State failed to show that Windham would be unable to demonstrate the State's reasons for its actions were pretextual.  See id. at *12 
("[V]iewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Fukumoto, the State did not negate that Fukumoto could show pretext nor did it demonstrate that Fukumoto would be unable to carry her burden at trial of showing that the State's proffered 
reasons were pretextual.").   
Based on the foregoing, the circuit court erred in 
granting summary judgment.  Thus, we vacate the circuit court's 
November 16, 2018 Final Judgment, and remand this case for NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
