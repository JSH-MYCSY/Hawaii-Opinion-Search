Plaintiff-Appellant/Cross-Appellee, v. CITY AND COUNTY OF
HONOLULU, Defendant-Appellee/Cross-Appellee, and
HONOLULU CIVIL BEAT, INC., Intervenor-Defendant-Appellee/
Cross-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 17-1-1433) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Reifurth, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
appellate jurisdiction over the appeal and cross-appeal from the 
Honorable Virginia Lea Crandall's November 16, 2018 judgment in 
appellate court case number CAAP-18-0000958. Although the 
November 16, 2018 judgment was an appealable final judgment 
pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-1(a)(2016) and 
Rule 58 of the Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) under the 
holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai# i 
115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994), Plaintiff/Appellant/Cross-
Appellee State of Hawai# i Organization of Police Officers (SHOPO) 
did not file its December 18, 2018 notice of appeal within thirty days after entry of the November 16, 2018 judgment, as NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Rule 4(a)(1) of the Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 
required for a timely appeal. 
With respect to the attempt by Intervenor-
Defendant/Appellee/Cross-Appellant Honolulu Civil Beat, Inc. 
(Honolulu Civil Beat) to assert a cross-appeal, HRAP Rule 4(a)(2) 
authorizes that "[i]n civil cases involving multiple-party 
plaintiffs or defendants, if one party files a timely notice of 
appeal, any other party whether on the same or opposite side as 
the party first appealing, may file a notice of cross-appeal." 
(Emphasis added). 
Furthermore, HRAP Rule 4.1(b)(1) requires that 
"[a] notice of cross-appeal shall be filed within 14 days after the notice of appeal is served on the cross-appellant, or within 
the time prescribed for filing the notice of appeal, whichever is 
later." Because SHOPO's December 18, 2018 notice of appeal was 
untimely, HRAP Rule 4.1(a)(2) did not authorize Honolulu Civil 
Beat to assert a cross-appeal by filing a notice of a cross-
appeal within fourteen days after service of SHOPO's notice of 
appeal pursuant to HRAP Rule 4.1(b)(1). Under the circumstances, 
Honolulu Civil Beat could obtain appellate review of the 
November 16, 2018 judgment only by asserting a standard appeal 
within the time prescribed for a notice of appeal under HRAP 
Rule 4(a)(1). Similar to SHOPO and its untimely notice of 
appeal, Honolulu Civil Beat failed to file its December 20, 2018 
notice of cross-appeal within thirty days after entry of the 
November 16, 2018 judgment, as HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) required for a 
timely appeal. 
The failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a 
civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot 
waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise 
of judicial discretion. Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 
P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or 
justice is authorized to change the jurisdictional requirements 
contained in Rule 4 of these rules."); HRAP Rule 26(e) ("The 
reviewing court for good cause shown may relieve a party from a 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
default occasioned by any failure to comply with these rules, 
except the failure to give timely notice of appeal."). 
Therefore, it is hereby ordered that the appeal and 
cross-appeal in appellate court case number CAAP-18-0000958 are 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
