APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 1CC111001366) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Hiraoka and McCullen, JJ.) 
Defendants-Appellants Hossain Mostoufi and Mitra 
Mostoufi (collectively, the Mostoufis) appeal from: (1) the order 
granting the motion filed by Plaintiff-Appellee Bank of Hawaii 
(BOH) to confirm the foreclosure sale, approve the commissioner's 
report, award attorneys' fees and costs, enter a deficiency 
judgment, and issue a writ of possession (Order Confirming Sale); 
and (2) the judgment confirming the foreclosure sale (Judgment 
Confirming Sale).  Both were entered by the Circuit Court of the 
First Circuit on November 26, 2018.1  For the reasons explained 
below, we affirm the Order Confirming Sale and the Judgment 
1 The Honorable Dean E. Ochiai presided.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Confirming Sale, without prejudice to the Mostoufis contesting 
the amount of any deficiency judgment should BOH move for entry of a deficiency judgment against either of them. 
BOH filed the complaint below on July 5, 2011.  BOH 
made two loans to Hossain.
2  Each loan was secured by a mortgage 
on real property (the Property) owned by the Mostoufis.3  Hossain 
defaulted on the loans.  BOH sought to foreclose on the mortgages.  The Mostoufis answered the complaint, denied BOH's allegations, and asserted various affirmative defenses. 
BOH filed a motion for summary judgment and 
interlocutory decree of foreclosure on March 2, 2018.  On April 17, 2018, the circuit court entered findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an order granting the motion and appointing a commissioner to sell the Property (Foreclosure 
Order).  The Foreclosure Judgment was entered on May 11, 2018. 
The Mostoufis did not appeal from the Foreclosure Judgment. 
The commissioner filed a report on August 15, 2018. 
BOH was the only bidder at the foreclosure auction.  On 
September 21, 2018, BOH moved for approval of the commissioner's report, confirmation of the foreclosure sale, award of attorneys' fees and costs, a deficiency judgment, and a writ of possession.  The Order Confirming Sale and the Judgment Confirming Sale were entered on November 26, 2018.  This appeal followed. 
The Mostoufis contend that the circuit court erred 
because: (1) it didn't determine the actual value of the 
foreclosed property before ordering entry of a deficiency 
judgment; and (2) BOH's motion to recover its attorneys' fees and 
costs incurred to obtain the Foreclosure Judgment was untimely. 
We review questions of law de novo under the 
right/wrong standard.  HawaiiUSA Fed. Credit Union v. Monalim, 
2 This case was the subject of two prior appeals: Bank of Hawaii v.
Mostoufi, No. CAAP-13-0001679, 2016 WL 3615664 (Haw. App. June 30, 2016)
(SDO); and Bank of Hawaii v. Mostoufi, No. CAAP-14-0001073, 2016 WL 3615334(Haw. App. June 30, 2016) (SDO).  We mention only the facts and proceduralhistory relevant to this third appeal. 
3 Hossain and Mitra are siblings.

147 Hawai# i 33, 40, 464 P.3d 821, 828 (2020), cert. denied sub 
nom. Monalim v. HawaiiUSA Fed. Credit Union, 141 S. Ct. 1059 
(Mem.), 208 L. Ed. 2d 525 (Jan. 11, 2021).  A mortgage foreclosure is a proceeding in equity.  Id. at 41, 464 P.3d at 829.  We review equitable relief for abuse of discretion; a trial court abuses its discretion if it clearly exceeds the bounds of reason or disregards rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of the appellant.  Id. at 40, 464 P.3d at 828. 
(1) The Mostoufis argue that the circuit court erred 
by failing to determine the actual value of the Property before ordering entry of a deficiency judgment. 
HRS ยง 667-1.5 (2016) "confers on the court specific 
authority to render a deficiency judgment, as an incident to the foreclosure."  Monalim, 147 
Hawai# i at 47, 464 P.3d at 835 
(internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Bank of Honolulu, N.A. v. Anderson, 3 Haw. App. 545, 549, 654 P.2d 1370, 1374 (1982)).  HRS ยง 667-51 (2016) provides, in relevant part: 
(a) Without limiting the class of orders not specified in
section 641-1 from which appeals may also be taken, thefollowing orders entered in a foreclosure case shall befinal and appealable: 
(1) A judgment entered on a decree of foreclosure , 
and if the judgment incorporates an order ofsale or an adjudication of a movant's right to a
deficiency judgment, or both, then the order of
sale or the adjudication of liability for thedeficiency judgment also shall be deemed finaland appealable; 
(2) A judgment entered on an order confirming thesale of the foreclosed property , if the circuit
court expressly finds that no just reason fordelay exists, and certifies the judgment asfinal pursuant to rule 54(b) of the Hawaii rulesof civil procedure; and 
(3) A deficiency judgment ; provided that no appeal
from a deficiency judgment shall raise issues
relating to the judgment debtor's liability for
the deficiency judgment (as opposed to theamount of the deficiency judgment), nor shallthe appeal affect the finality of the transferof title to the foreclosed property pursuant tothe order confirming sale. 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(Emphasis added.)  In this case, neither the Foreclosure Judgment 
nor the Judgment Confirming Sale liquidated the amount of any deficiency.  The circuit court hasn't entered a deficiency judgment against the Mostoufis under HRS ยง 667-51(a)(3).  Should BOH move for entry of a deficiency judgment, the Mostoufis could then "request a determination of the fair market value of the real estate as of the date of the foreclosure sale."  Monalim, 147 
Hawai# i at 49, 464 P.3d at 837 (cleaned up).4  Accordingly, 
we conclude that the Mostoufis' first point of error is premature.  It may be raised, if appropriate, on an appeal from any deficiency judgment that may be entered by the circuit court in the future. 
(2) The Mostoufis argue that BOH's motion to recover 
its attorneys' fees and costs connected with the Foreclosure Judgment was untimely, because BOH didn't file the motion within fourteen days after entry of the judgment as required by 
Hawai# i 
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 54(d). 
HRCP Rule 54(d)(2) provides, in relevant part: 
(A) Claims for attorneys' fees and related
nontaxable expenses shall be made by motion unless the
substantive law governing the action provides for therecovery of such fees as an element of damages to be provedat trial. 
(B) Unless otherwise provided by  statute or order of 
the court , the motion must be filed and served no later than
14 days after entry of an appealable order or judgment[.] 
(Emphasis added.) 
4 In Monalim, the supreme court adopted a new method of calculating
a deficiency judgment allowing "the deficiency defendant the right to insistthat the greater of the fair market value of the real estate or theforeclosure sale price be used in calculating the deficiency."  147 
Hawai #i at 
45, 464 P.3d at 833 (cleaned up).  The new right applied prospectively, "toforeclosure cases in which a deficiency judgment is first entered after thedate of" the supreme court's opinion.  Id. at 54, 464 P.3d at 842.  In this case, the record on appeal does not reflect entry of a deficiency judgment;the right recognized in Monalim would thus apply to any future deficiencyjudgment against the Mostoufis. 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Foreclosure Order stated: 
10. . . . At the hearing to consider confirmation of
the foreclosure sale, . . . there shall be determined . . .
the amount of the attorneys' fees and costs of [BOH], andthe final payment of the proceeds of the foreclosure saleshall be directed. 
BOH was allowed, under the Foreclosure Order, to file its motion 
for attorneys' fees connected with the Foreclosure Judgment as part of its motion for confirmation of the foreclosure sale.  The Mostoufis' second point of error is without merit. 
Based upon the foregoing, we affirm the circuit court's 
"Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for: (1) Confirmation of Sale; (2) Approval of Commissioner's Report; (3) Attorneys' Fees and Costs; (4) Deficiency Judgment; and (5) Writ of Possession" and the "Final Judgment," without prejudice to the Mostoufis contesting the amount of any deficiency judgment should BOH move for entry of a deficiency judgment against either of them.
