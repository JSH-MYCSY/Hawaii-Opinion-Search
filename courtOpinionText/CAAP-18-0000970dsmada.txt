APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 14-1-0144) 
ORDER APPROVING STIPULATION TO DISMISS APPEAL 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.
 
Upon consideration of the Stipulation for Dismissal of 
Appeal, filed April 30, 2019, by Defendant-Appellant Wendy Bright 
(Bright), Trustee, the papers in support, and the record, it 
appears that (1) under Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
(HRAP) Rule 42(b), the parties stipulate to dismiss the appeal, that "each party [is] to be responsible for their own fees and 
costs," and that "[o]utstanding fees and costs required by [HRAP] 
Rule 45(e)(1) and other obligations of the Defendant-Appellant 
under HRS Chapter 607 or other statutes or rules shall be paid by 
the Defendant-Appellant"; (2) the stipulation is dated and signed 
by counsel for all parties appearing in the appeal; and (3) all 
filing and docketing fees required by HRAP Rule 45(e)(1) have 
been paid and the appeal has been docketed. 
We understand the 
fees and costs referred to in the second sentence of the stipulation to refer to fees and costs that are potentially NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
outside the scope of the fees and costs referred to in the first 
sentence of the stipulation because otherwise that portion of the 
second sentence would be unnecessary. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the stipulation to 
dismiss the appeal is approved, and the appeal is dismissed. Any 
outstanding fees and costs required by HRS Chapter 607 or other 
statutes or rules shall be paid by Bright.
