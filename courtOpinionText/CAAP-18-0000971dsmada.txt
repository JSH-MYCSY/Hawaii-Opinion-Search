APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
ORDER 
GRANTING FEBRUARY 25, 2019 MOTION TO DISMISS
APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Reifurth, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Upon review of (1) Real Party in Interest/Appellee 
Myles T. Yamamoto's (Yamamoto) February 25, 2019 motion to 
dismiss appellate court case number CAAP-18-0000971 for lack of NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appellate jurisdiction, (2) Plaintiffs/Counterclaim-Defendants/ 
Appellants Spencer James Bevill, Nancy Lynn Bevill, and Bevill 
Family Trust's (Appellants) March 4, 2019 memorandum in 
opposition to Yamamoto's February 25, 2019 motion, and (3) the 
record, it appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction over 
Appellants' appeal from the Honorable Rhonda I.L. Loo's 
December 5, 2018 order denying Appellants' renewed motion for 
full release of settlement funds in the consolidated cases of 
Civil Nos. 08-1-0293(1) and 12-1-0790(1) (Order). 
Appellants contend that we have jurisdiction under the 
collateral order doctrine, citing Siangco v. Kasadate, 77 Hawai# i 
157, 161, 883 P.2d 78, 82 (1994). "In order to fall within the narrow ambit of the collateral order doctrine, the order must 
[1] conclusively determine the disputed question, [2] resolve an 
important issue completely separate from the merits of the 
action, and [3] be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a 
final judgment." 
Id. (citation and internal quotation marks 
omitted). See also Cook v. Surety Life Ins. Co., 79 Hawai# i 403, 
408, 903 P.2d 708, 713 (App. 1995) ("[A]n order enforcing a 
settlement agreement is a collateral order which is 
appealable."); Booker v. Midpac Lumber Co., Ltd., 2 Haw. App. 
569, 571, 636 P.2d 1359, 1362 (1981) (Acknowledging that an 
interlocutory order awarding a discharged attorney his fees and 
costs pursuant to the attorney's lien against his former client's 
award or settlement proceeds "is an appealable collateral 
order."), reversed on other grounds, Booker v. Midpac Lumber Co., 
Ltd., 65 Haw. 166, 173, 649 P.2d 376, 381 (1982). 
In the instant case, the order does not conclusively 
determine the disputed question; i.e., how the circuit court 
should distribute the settlement funds between Appellants and 
Yamamoto. 
The circuit court will not decide that question until 
the conclusion of the arbitration that the circuit court 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
ordered. Appellants' appeal is premature, and we lack appellate 
jurisdiction to review the December 5, 2018 Order. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Yamamoto's 
February 25, 2019 motion to dismiss appellate court case number 
CAAP-18-0000971 for lack of appellate jurisdiction is granted, 
and appellate court case number CAAP-18-0000971 is dismissed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, March 18, 2019.
