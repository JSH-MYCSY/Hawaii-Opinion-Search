NO. CAAP-18-0000973 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
LOUIS LANCE KEONI PALAMA, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO 5DTC-18-002710) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Reifurth, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record in appellate court case 
number CAAP-18-0000973, it appears that we lack appellate 
jurisdiction pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-
12(a) (2016).  In this appeal, Defendant-Appellant Louis Palama 
(Palama), pro se, appears to be appealing from Plaintiff-Appellee 
State of Hawaii's (the State) December 18, 2018 citation for 
operating a motor vehicle without a valid license in violation of 
HRS § 286-102 (2007 & Supp. 2018) and operating a motor vehicle 
without proof of liability insurance in violation of HRS 
§ 431:10C-104 (2005) that initiated district court criminal case 
number 5DTC-18-002710.  Under these circumstances, the dismissal 
of this appeal is warranted. 
"The right of appeal in a criminal case is purely 
statutory[.]"  State v. Nicol, 140 Hawai# i 482, 485, 403 P.3d 
259, 262 (2017) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The 
Hawai# i Intermediate Court of Appeals has jurisdiction "[t]o 
hear and determine appeals from any court or agency when appeals NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
are allowed by law[.]"  HRS § 602-57(1) (2016).  HRS § 641-12(a) 
is the statute providing that "[a]ppeals upon the record shall be 
allowed from all final decisions and final judgments of district 
courts in all criminal matters."  Consequently, "in order to 
appeal a criminal matter in the district court, the appealing 
party must appeal from a written judgment or order that has been 
filed with the clerk of the court pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(b)(3)." 
State v. Bohannon, 102 Hawai# i 228, 236, 74 P.3d 980, 988 (2003); 
see also Rule 32(c)(2) of the Hawai# i
 Rules of Penal Procedure. 
In order to perfect a defendant's right to appeal from a district 
court criminal case pursuant to HRS § 641-12(a), the district 
court must enter either a judgment of conviction with a complete 
sentence, or an order dismissing the complaint without prejudice, 
thereby terminating the proceedings and leaving nothing further 
to be accomplished by the district court.  State v. Kilborn, 109 
Hawai# i 435, 442, 127 P.3d 95, 102 (App. 2005) (regarding the 
appealability of a district court judgment of conviction and sentence under HRS § 641-12); Nicol, 140 Hawai# i at 491, 403 P.3d 
at 268 (Explaining that "under the Hawaii Revised Statutes, district court defendants . . . in . . . district . . . court may 
appeal from an order dismissing proceedings without prejudice." 
(citations omitted)).  Although the district court dismissed the 
charge of operating a motor vehicle without proof of liability 
insurance in violation of HRS § 431:10C-104, the remaining charge 
of operating a motor vehicle without a valid license in violation 
of HRS § 286-102 has not yet gone to trial.  Therefore, Palama's 
appeal is premature, and we lack appellate jurisdiction. 
For the purpose of assisting the district court in 
future similar circumstances, we note that it is unnecessary for 
the district court to continue a trial based on a 
jurisdictionally defective appeal.  "Generally, the filing of a 
notice of appeal divests the trial court of jurisdiction over the 
appealed case."  TSA Int'l Ltd. v. Shimizu Corp., 92 Hawai# i 243, 
265, 990 P.2d 713, 735 (1999) (citations omitted).  "The general rule, however, assumes that the notice of appeal is valid under 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the applicable statutory provisions and procedural rules.  Where 
the notice of appeal is jurisdictionally defective, filing the 
notice does not transfer jurisdiction from the trial court to the 
appellate court."  State v. Ontiveros, 82 Hawai# i 446, 449, 923 
P.2d 388, 391 (1996) (citations omitted; emphasis added). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court 
case number CAAP-18-0000973 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
