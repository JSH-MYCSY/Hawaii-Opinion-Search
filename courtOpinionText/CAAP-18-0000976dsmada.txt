HL, Petitioner-Appellant,
v.
JC, Respondent-Appellee
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(FC-DA NO. 18-1-1411)
ORDER OF DISMISSAL
(By:  Leonard, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.)
Petitioner-Appellant HL ( Wife) appeals from the "Order
Regarding Temporary Restraining Order Filed on: June 22, 2018"
(No Further Action Order ), entered by the Family Court of the
First Circuit  on December 12, 2018.  We take judicial notice of
the documents filed in HL v. JC, FC-DA No. 18-1-2939, Family
Court of the First Circuit, State of Hawai# i (Second Petition for
Protection ), and HL v. JC, FC-DV No. 18-1-0799, Family Court of
the First Circuit, State of Hawai# i (the Divorce Case), pursuant
to Rule 201 of the Hawai#i Rules of Evidence (1981).  This appeal
is dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, as
explained below.1
I.
On June 22, 2018, Wife (who was then self-represented)
filed a petition for an order for protection pursuant to Hawaii
Revised Statutes (HRS ) Chapter 586 (Domestic Abuse Protective
Orders).  A temporary restraining order ( First TRO ) was issued
1The Honorable Linda S. Martell presided.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
against Respondent-Appellee JC (Husband ) and the show-cause
hearing was set for July 3, 2018.  At the show-cause hearing,
Wife requested a continuance because she had been served with a
cross-TRO obtained by Husband and intended to retain counsel. 
The family court continued the hearing to August 14, 2018, to
allow Wife to retain counsel.
On July 11, 2018, Wife filed a complaint against
Husband in the Divorce Case.
Wife and Husband both attended the August 14, 2018
hearing,2 and both were represented by counsel.  Husband
requested another continuance.  The record does not indicate a
reason for the requested continuance, but Wife did not object. 
The family court continued the hearing to October 8, 2018, and
ordered the Department of Human Services (DHS ) to investigate the
case and submit a written report.  DHS filed its report on
September 28, 2018.
Wife and Husband both attended the October 8, 2018
hearing,  and both were represented by counsel.  Husband
requested another continuance because his criminal matter was
scheduled for October 15, 2018.   The family court continued the
hearing to December 12, 2018, over Wife's objection.  The record
does not indicate whether Husband's request or the family court's
order was specifically based upon Husband's assertion of his
Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.43
Wife and Husband both attended the December 12, 2018
hearing,  and both were represented by counsel.  The family
court's minutes state:5
2The family court's minutes indicate that the hearing was
consolidated with the show-cause hearing on FC-DA No. 18-1-1475, which appears
to be Husband's petition for an HRS Chapter 586 order for protection.
3The family court's minutes indicate that the hearing was again
consolidated with FC-DA No. 18-1-1475.
4The record does not reflect what offenses Husband was charged with
committing, or the nature of the October 15, 2018 proceeding.
5The family court's minutes indicate that the hearing was again
consolidated with FC-DA No. 18-1-1475.
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
AFTER HEARING THE ARGUMENTS OF COUNSEL, COURT WOULD 
HAVE GRANTED [Husband]'s  REQUEST TO CONTINUE THE
TRIAL DUE TO [Husband]'s CRIMINAL MATTER.
HOWEVER, THIS TRO FILED ON 6/22/18 IS SET TO EXPIRE ON
12/19/18; & FC-DA 18-1-1475 FILED ON 6/28/18 IS
SET TO EXPIRE ON 12/25/18.
THEREFORE, THE COURT TAKES NO FURTHER ACTION ON BOTH 
MATTERS & THE TROS WILL EXPIRE RESPECTIVELY ON THE
DATES ABOVE, OVER [Wife]'s OBJECTION.
BOTH PARTIES [are] FREE TO FILE NEW PETITIONS.
The family court issued the No Further Action Order on
December 12, 2018.  The family court contemporaneously issued a
new TRO to Wife against Husband (Second TRO) in Wife's Second
Petition for Protection.
On December 31, 2018, Wife moved for reconsideration of
the No Further Action Order and a new trial.  Wife's notice of
appeal from the No Further Action Order was also filed on
December 31, 2018.  On May 14, 2019, in the Second Petition for
Protection, the family court issued a protective order
(Protective Order ) against Husband.  The Protective Order remains
valid until May 14, 2023, as to Wife, and until May 12, 2021, as
to Husband's and Wife's children XC1, XC2, and XC3 (collectively,
the Children).
The Divorce Case remains pending.
On October 24, 2019, we issued an amended order that
Wife show cause why this appeal is not moot and should not be
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction, citing Hamilton ex
rel. Letham v. Lethem, 119 Hawai# i 1, 193 P.3d 839 (2008). 
Wife's response was filed on October 30, 2019.
II.
"It is axiomatic that mootness is an issue of subject
matter jurisdiction.  Whether a court possesses subject matter
jurisdiction is a question of law[.]"  Hamilton, 119 Hawai# i at
4-5, 193 P.3d at 842-43 (citation and internal quotation marks
omitted).
The mootness doctrine is said to encompass the circumstances
that destroy the justiciability of a suit previously
suitable for determination.  Put another way, the suit must
remain alive throughout the course of litigation to the
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
moment of final appellate disposition.  Its chief purpose is
to assure that the adversary system, once set in operation,
remains properly fueled.  The doctrine seems appropriate
where events subsequent to the judgment of the trial court
have so affected the relations between the parties that the
two conditions for justiciability relevant on appeal —
adverse interest and effective remedy — have been
compromised.
Id. at 5, 193 P.3d at 843 (citations omitted).
In this case, Wife filed her Second Petition for
Protection and obtained the Second TRO before the First TRO
expired.  Wife then obtained the Protective Order — the same
remedy she sought in the case below.  Wife's response to the
amended order to show cause argues that two of the exceptions to
the mootness doctrine — "capable of repetition[,] yet evading
review" and "[p]ublic [i]nterest" — apply.6
The phrase, "capable of repetition, yet evading review,"
means that a court will not dismiss a case on the grounds of
mootness where a challenged governmental action would evade
full review because the passage of time would prevent any
single plaintiff from remaining subject to the restriction
complained of for the period necessary to complete the
lawsuit.
Hamilton, 119 Hawai#i at 5, 193 P.3d at 843 (cleaned up).  As the
supreme court noted in Hamilton, "a TRO, by its very nature, will
always evade review because it would, as it did here, expire
within the initial ninety-day[ ] term. . . . [T]he issue here is
whether the factual situation underlying this case is 'capable of
repetition.'"  Id. at 6, 193 P.3d at 844 (footnote added)
(citation omitted).  The factual situation underlying this appeal
will not be repeated because the Protective Order is now in
place, and it provides Wife with all of the relief she originally
sought below.7
6A third exception (the "collateral consequences" exception) was
adopted by the Hawai #i Supreme Court in Hamilton but does not apply to the
facts or circumstances of Wife's case.
7The statute at issue in Hamilton was HRS § 586–5 (2006), which
stated that a TRO granted pursuant to HRS chapter 586 shall not exceed ninety
days.  The statute was amended effective June 8, 2011, to provide for a one
hundred eighty-day maximum time period.  2011 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 85, § 1 at
236.
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
With regard to the "[p]ublic [i]nterest" exception:
When analyzing the public interest exception, [the supreme]
court looks to (1) the public or private nature of the
question presented, (2) the desirability of an authoritative
determination for future guidance of public officers, and
(3) the likelihood of future recurrence of the question.
Hamilton, 119 Hawai#i at 6-7, 193 P.3d at 844-45 (citation and
brackets omitted).  In Hamilton the petitioner argued that the
temporary restraining order at issue affected his constitutional
right to raise his children.  The supreme court held that the
right asserted was personal to the petitioner, and thus of a
private nature.  Id. at 7, 193 P.3d at 845.  The supreme court
noted that "the cases . . . that have applied the public interest
exception have focused largely on political or legislative issues
that affect a significant number of Hawai# i residents," citing
cases involving the grandparent visitation statute, the statute
providing retirement benefits to all state and county employees,
and the City and County of Honolulu's compliance with the
Sunshine Law.  Id.  This case does not "involve political or
legislative matters that will affect a significant number of
people."  Id.  The public interest exception does not apply.
III.
This appeal is moot and none of the exceptions to the
mootness doctrine apply.  The appeal is dismissed for lack of
subject matter jurisdiction.
