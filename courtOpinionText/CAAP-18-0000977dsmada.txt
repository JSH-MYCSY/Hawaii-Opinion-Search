and HRS § 605–14 (2016),3 persons who are not licensed to 
practice law in Hawai# i "are not permitted to act as attorneys 
and represent other natural persons in their causes."  Regaud v. 
Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Waikiki Lanais, No. 26218, 2004 WL 758944, at *1 (Haw. Apr. 7, 2004) (order dismissing appeal) (quoting Oahu Plumbing & Sheet Metal, Ltd. v. Kona Constr., Inc., 60 Haw. 372, 377, 590 P.2d 570, 573 (1979)); 
7. "A next friend . . . is not a party to the suit, 
but simply a person appointed by the court to look after the interests of one who, by reasons of some legal disability, is unable to look after [their] own interests, and to manage the suit for [them]."  Leslie v. Estate of Tavares, 91 Hawai# i 394,

9. "[A] parent or guardian cannot bring an action on 
behalf of a minor child without retaining a lawyer."  Regaud at 
*1 (quoting Johns v. Cty. of San Diego, 114 F.3d 874, 877 (9th Cir. 1997)); 
10. The Notice of Appeal, not having been signed on 
behalf of EP, a minor, by a person licensed to practice law in Hawai# i, is not valid; 
11. On July 31, 2019, we issued an order granting what 
we construed as Parkman's motion to relieve EP from defaults in filing the statement of jurisdiction and the opening brief, and extending the time for EP to file the statement of jurisdiction and the opening brief; 
12. On September 18, 2019, we issued a second order 
granting what we construed as Parkman's motion to relieve EP from further defaults in filing the statement of jurisdiction and the opening brief, and again extending the time for EP to file the statement of jurisdiction and the opening brief; and 
13. Although we previously acted on filings by 
Parkman, we must dismiss an appeal when we determine that we lack jurisdiction.  In re Robert's Tours & Transp., Inc., 104 Hawai# i 
98, 101, 85 P.3d 623, 626 (2004) ("Although neither party raises a jurisdictional issue in this appeal, '[a]n appellate court has . . . an independent obligation to ensure jurisdiction over each case and to dismiss the appeal sua sponte if a jurisdictional defect exists.'"). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is 
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because a valid notice of appeal was not filed on behalf of EP within the time required by Rule 4(a)(1) of the Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure. 
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, July 26, 2021.
