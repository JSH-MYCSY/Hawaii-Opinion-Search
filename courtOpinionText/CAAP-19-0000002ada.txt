as he did below, Langdon challenges the legality of Act 200 of 
the 2016 Session Laws of 
Hawai# i, which enacted HRS § 249-14.1 
and amended HRS § 286-25. 2016 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 200, §§ 1, 10 at 612, 615. As explained below, we affirm the District Court's 
ruling that Langdon violated HRS § 286-25 and reverse the ruling 
that Langdon violated HRS § 249-14.1. 
I. BACKGROUND 
On July 23, 2018, Langdon was issued a citation for 
operating a moped without a certificate of inspection and a moped 
license plate, in violation of HRS §§ 286-25 and 249-14.1. 
The 
"Officer's Observations" section of the citation stated: "Observed moped traveling W on Malia St approaching [ ] Kilauea 
Ave - no license plate or safety decal on moped - only decal 
[illegible] he didn't believe he should have to register moped 
b/c he should be 'grandfathered in.'" 
On August 9, 2018, Langdon filed a written statement 
contesting the citation. Langdon admitted that he did not have a 
new certificate of inspection or a new moped plate, but 
challenged the legality of the underlying law as applied. 
After the District Court initially entered judgment in 
favor of the State and against Langdon for both violations, 
Langdon filed a Request for Trial. 
On December 19, 2018, the District Court held a trial 
de novo and vacated the prior judgment. Langdon was "arraigned" 
as follows: 
[MS. PROSECUTOR:] As to Count 1, on or about
July 23rd, 2018, in the City and County of Honolulu, State
of Hawai #i, you, David Roy Langdon, operated, permitted the
operation of, caused the operation of, or parked a vehicleor moped on a public highway without a current officialcertificate of inspection, thereby violating section 286-25of the Hawai #i Revised Statutes. 
As to Count 2, on or about Sep -- July 23rd, 2018, in
the City and County of Honolulu, State of 
Hawai #i, you,
David Roy Langdon, failed to securely fasten the numberplate on the rear of the moped at a location provided by themanufacturer or in the absence of such a location upon thebumper of the moped as in conformance with section 291-31 insuch a manner as to prevent the plate from swinging and 
3 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
defendant failed to display the number plate entirely
unobscured and be kept reasonably clean in violation ofsection 249-14.1 of the Hawai #i Revised Statutes. 
The State introduced Exhibit 1, a document by the City 
and County of Honolulu, Department of Customer Service Motor 
Vehicle Registration, certifying Langdon was the registered owner 
of a moped with license plate Z26629. The exhibit was admitted 
without objection. 
After Langdon offered his own exhibit and commented on 
it, the District Court apparently construed his comments and the 
statements made in his document as a motion to dismiss. The 
District Court denied the motion. Langdon's document was 
admitted into evidence as Exhibit A. Exhibit A included a letter 
dated July 25, 2018, in which Langdon asserted that Act 200 of 
the 2016 Session Laws of Hawai# i was illegally applied because: 
(1) it was a bill of attainder and/or ex post facto law and an abridgment of constitutional protections; (2) it violated due 
process because it requires mopeds to obtain a safety inspection; 
(3) the City and County of Honolulu committed "fraud of issuance" 
when it previously issued to Langdon a "permanent license"; and 
(4) a proper interpretation of Act 200 reflects that it did not 
invalidate all current permanent moped registrations. Exhibit A 
also included a letter dated August 14, 2017, from the City and 
County of Honolulu, Department of Customer Services, informing 
Langdon that Act 200 required annual moped registration and 
safety inspections and "will also invalidate all current 
permanent moped registrations." 
Officer Jenna Lynn Shimabuku (Officer Shimabuku) 
testified that she is a police officer and was on duty on 
July 23, 2018, when she cited Langdon for not having a license 
plate and safety check for a moped. She observed him on Malia 
Street, which is a public way, street, or highway in the City and 
County of Honolulu. Langdon drew her attention because he did 
not have a larger license plate that was supposed to be issued by 
the end of 2017. When she informed Langdon of his violations, 
4 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Langdon stated that he did not believe he should have to get a 
license plate or safety check because he should be "grandfathered 
in." 
The license decal on his moped was Z26629. The District 
Court approved the State's request for the record to reflect that Exhibit 1 was proof that Langdon's moped license was Z26629 and 
that he was the registered owner. 
During his testimony, Langdon stated his various 
arguments challenging the legality of Act 200, as asserted in his 
Exhibit A. However, Langdon again admitted he did not have a new 
moped license plate or safety inspection. 
The District Court ultimately concluded as to Count 1 
that Langdon had no current safety check and as to Count 2 had 
not secured a new moped registration as required. On 
December 19, 2018, the District Court filed its Notice of Entry 
of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, finding that Langdon 
violated HRS §§ 286-25 and 249-14.1. 
II. POINTS OF ERROR 
On appeal, Langdon reasserts his arguments below 
challenging the legality of Act 200 of the 2016 Session Laws of 
Hawai# i. 2016 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 200, §§ 1, 10 at 612, 615. 
Langdon argues that Act 200 was illegal as applied and violated his rights because: (1) it was a bill of attainder and/or ex post 
facto law and an abridgment of constitutional protections; (2) it 
violated due process because it automatically deems mopeds 
without a safety inspection sticker to be unsafe; (3) its 
requirements rendered the City and County of Honolulu's previous 
issuance of a "permanent license" to be "fraud of issuance"; and 
(4) a proper interpretation of Act 200 reflects that it did not 
invalidate all current permanent moped registrations. 
III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
"Statutory interpretation 'is a question of law 
reviewable de novo.'" Citizens Against Reckless Dev. v. Zoning 
Bd. of Appeals, 114 Hawai# i 184, 193, 159 P.3d 143, 152 (2007)

5 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2003)). 
When construing statutes, this court is governed by the 
following rules: 
First, the fundamental starting point for statutory
interpretation is the language of the statute itself.
Second, where the statutory language is plain andunambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plainand obvious meaning. Third, implicit in the task ofstatutory construction is our foremost obligation toascertain and give effect to the intention of thelegislature, which is to be obtained primarily from thelanguage contained in the statute itself. Fourth, whenthere is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or indistinctivenessor uncertainty of an expression used in a statute, anambiguity exists. 
When there is ambiguity in a statute, "the meaning of
the ambiguous words may be sought by examining the context,with which the ambiguous words, phrases, and sentences maybe compared, in order to ascertain their true meaning."Moreover, the courts may resort to extrinsic aids indetermining legislative intent, such as legislative history,or the reason and spirit of the law. 
Id. at 193-94, 159 P.3d at 152-53 (citations omitted). 
IV. DISCUSSION 
A. Act 200 is not a bill of attainder or an ex post facto law. 
Article I, Section 10, Clause 1 of the United States 
Constitution states: "No State shall . . . pass any Bill of 
Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation of 
Contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility." "A bill of attainder 
is a legislative act which inflicts punishment without a judicial 
trial." Cummings v. Missouri, 71 U.S. 277, 323 (1886). "However 
expansive the prohibition against bills of attainder, it surely 
was not intended to serve as a variant of the equal protection 
doctrine, invalidating every Act of Congress or the States that 
legislatively burdens some persons or groups but not all other 
plausible individuals." Nixon v. Adm'r of Gen. Servs., 433 U.S. 
425, 471 (1977) (footnotes omitted). 
With respect to the Ex Post Facto Clause, the United
States Supreme Court has stated:  
By an ex post facto law is meant one which imposes a
punishment for an act which was not punishable at the time
it was committed; or imposes additional punishment to thatthen prescribed; or changes the rules of evidence by whichless or different testimony is sufficient to convict thanwas then required.

Cummings
, 71 U.S. at 325-26. 
We must ascertain whether the legislature meant the statute
to establish civil proceedings. If the intention of the legislature was to impose punishment, that ends the inquiry.If, however, the intention was to enact a regulatory schemethat is civil and nonpunitive, we must further examinewhether the statutory scheme is so punitive either inpurpose or effect as to negate the State's intentions todeem it civil. 
Smith v. Doe, 538 U.S. 84, 92 (2003) (citations, brackets, and 
quotation marks omitted). 
Moreover, the Hawai# i Supreme Court has stated: 
The "intent-effects" test is applied to determine whether a
statute runs afoul of the federal ex post facto clause.Russell v. Gregoire, 124 F.3d 1079, 1084 (9th Cir. 1997).That test questions whether (1) the legislature intended thestatute to be criminal or civil, and (2) the statute is "'sopunitive' in effect that it overcomes the nonpunitivelegislative intent." Id. at 1088. "The first part of thetest ('intent') looks solely to the declared purpose of thelegislature as well as the structure and design of thestatute." Id. at 1087. "The second part of the test('effects') requires the party challenging the statute toprovide 'the clearest proof' that the statutory scheme is sopunitive either in purpose or effect as to negate theState's nonpunitive intent." Id. 
State v. Guidry, 105 Hawai# i 222, 235, 96 P.3d 242, 255 (2004). 
Violations of HRS §§ 249-14.1 and 286-25 are civil 
"traffic infractions" because they relate to traffic movement and 
control or equipment, and, therefore, cannot be criminal 
offenses. 
HRS § 291D-2 (2007); HRS § 291D-3 (2007); see State v. 
Rees, 107 Hawai# i 508, 518-19, 115 P.3d 687, 697-98 (App. 2005) 
(holding that a violation of HRS § 286-25 is a civil traffic 
infraction and not a criminal offense). 
A defendant may request 
a hearing to either "deny commission of the infraction(s) or admit commission of the infraction(s) but explain mitigating 
circumstances." Hawai# i Civil Traffic Rules (HCTR) Rule 11(a) 
(eff. 2006). "If the court determines that an infraction has been committed, judgment shall be entered in favor of the State." 
HCTR Rule 16(a) (eff. 2006). A defendant may then request a 
trial, which shall be held pursuant to HRS § 291D-13, the Hawai# i 
Rules of Penal Procedure, Rules of the District Court, and Hawai# i Rules of Evidence. HCTR Rule 19(a), (c) (eff. 2009). 
7 B. Act 200 does not violate due process, as claimed by Langdon. FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Therefore, Act 200 of the 2016 Session Laws of 
Hawai# i, with 
respect to its enactment of HRS § 249-14.1 and amendment of HRS 
§ 286-25, is not a bill of attainder because it affords a 
defendant the right to a trial. 
The legislative intent of the relevant part of Act 200 
was to establish "safety inspections and registration 
requirements for mopeds, as well as the issuance and use of 
number plates for mopeds, thereby increasing roadway safety in 
Hawai[# ]i." Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 158-16, in 2016 House Journal, 
at 1416, 2016 Senate Journal, at 842. Regarding the first part of the intent-effects test, the legislature deemed violations of 
HRS §§ 249-14.1 and 286-25 as civil proceedings and stated its 
intent to impose a regulatory scheme. As to the second part of 
the intent-effects test, Langdon failed to present any proof that 
the statutory scheme of either provision "is so punitive either 
in purpose or effect as to negate the State's nonpunitive 
intent." Guidry
, 105 Hawai# i at 235, 96 P.3d at 255 (quoting 
Russell, 124 F.3d at 1087). Therefore, the intent-effects test was not satisfied and Act 200 is not an ex post facto law. 
Langdon argues that Act 200 improperly imposed a safety 
inspection requirement upon his moped, in violation of due process, because his moped had already been deemed safe to 
operate without the safety inspection prior to Act 200. 
Act 200 amended HRS § 286-25 to require mopeds to have 
a current safety inspection when operated on a public highway. 
2016 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 200, § 10 at 615. The regulation of 
traffic upon public highways is unquestionably within the police 
powers of the legislature and is a rightful subject of 
legislation. Territory v. Tam
, 36 Haw. 32, 36-37 (Haw. Terr. 
1942). Contrary to Langdon's claim, no moped was deemed safe or unsafe prior to amendment of HRS § 286-25 to require mopeds to 
have a current safety inspection; mopeds were permitted to 
operate on a public highway without any determination as to their 
8 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
operational fitness. 
Langdon's due process argument therefore 
fails. 
C. Langdon's "fraud of issuance" argument is improper. 
Under his "fraud of issuance" argument, Langdon 
contends that he purchased a moped and obtained a "permanent 
license," pursuant to HRS § 249-14 (2001), prior to the enactment 
of Act 200, which eliminated the applicability of HRS § 249-14 to 
mopeds. Thus, he argues, if Act 200 invalidated his "permanent 
license," the City and County of Honolulu was liable for fraud 
for issuing the "permanent license." Langdon's argument is 
essentially an improper attempt to raise an affirmative claim for 
fraud against the City and County of Honolulu in his traffic 
violation proceedings. We therefore need not address this point. 
D. The District Court did not err in finding that Langdon
violated HRS § 286-25 for operating his moped without avalid safety inspection but erred in finding that heviolated HRS § 249-14.1 for failing to have a new mopedlicense plate because there is no statutory authority forthe issuance of a license plate to previously registeredmopeds. 
Langdon argues that Act 200 did not invalidate all 
current permanent moped registrations and that section 13 of the 
Act directed new plates be issued to him by December 31, 2017. 
Langdon further claims that the District Court failed to 
establish a clear record that he was guilty of not having the new 
plate and not having a safety inspection sticker. 
As to Langdon's assertion of a lack of a "clear 
record," the record on appeal reflects that Langdon admitted at 
trial that he did not have a new license plate or safety 
inspection. Langdon also concedes on appeal that he "did freely 
admit that he did not have a newly required Safety Inspection and 
new License plate, though he had a Permanent Moped Sticker." On 
this record, the District Court did not err in finding that 
Langdon violated HRS § 286-25 for operating his moped without a 
valid safety inspection. However, despite Langdon admitting that 
9 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
he did not have a license plate, we conclude that Langdon was not 
required to have a license plate under HRS § 249-14.1, as 
discussed infra. 
Section 13 of Act 200 does not stand for the 
proposition that Langdon seems to assert--that existing moped 
owners should be "grandfathered in," should be provided a "free" 
new license plate, and should not be subject to the new 
requirements imposed by Act 200. 
Rather, section 13 simply 
imposed a deadline for the issuance of license plates for "current permanent registered mopeds." 2016 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 
200, § 13 at 616 ("[T]he staggering of registration and issuance 
of license plates for the current permanent registered mopeds 
shall be completed by December 31, 2017."). One of the main 
purposes of Act 200 was to create an annual registration 
requirement for mopeds. S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 3061, in 2016 
Senate Journal, at 1318; H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 932-16, in 2016 
House Journal, at 1073; H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 548-16, in 2016 
House Journal, at 950; H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 243-16, in 2016 
House Journal, at 841. In the absence of any express language or 
legislative intent to the contrary, owners of "current permanent 
registered mopeds" are also subject to the new registration 
requirements under HRS § 249-14.1. However, Act 200 did not 
adopt any statutory authority for the issuance of license plates 
for previously registered mopeds. 
The August 14, 2017 letter from the City and County of 
Honolulu, Department of Customer Services, provided Langdon with 
instructions on the steps required to register his moped in 
conformity with Act 200. The issuance of a new license plate was 
explained in one of those steps, contingent on registration of 
the moped and payment of a registration fee. Although Langdon 
summarily states that he was not issued a license plate and 
relies on section 13 of Act 200 to state that this was error, 
there was no evidence that he took the steps necessary to receive 
a plate. 
10 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
To the extent the August 14, 2017 letter addressed 
issuance of a license plate for his moped, there was no statutory 
authority to do so under Act 200. 
Prior to Act 200, HRS § 249-14 
governed the registration of mopeds similar to bicycles and contained no provision regarding issuance of license plates. HRS 
§ 249-14.1 currently includes the phrase "upon the original 
registration" when directing the director of finance to issue a 
moped license plate. HRS chapter 249 does not contain a 
definition of "original registration" applicable to mopeds.

[A] cardinal rule of statutory construction is that courts

Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Omiya, 142 Hawai# i 439, 450, 420 P.3d

The ordinary meaning of "original" means "Preceding all 
others in time: First." Webster's II New College Dictionary 792 
(3d ed. 2005). Applying the ordinary meaning of "original," HRS 
§ 249-14.1 requires a license plate be issued when a moped is 
first registered. This would not include subsequent payment of a 
registration fee on an annual basis. 
The legislative history of Act 200 does not support an 
interpretation that previously registered mopeds are to be issued 
a license plate. Act 200 enacted H.B. 1753 into law. As passed 
by the House on its third reading, H.B. 1753, H.D. 3 proposed a 
section to be added to HRS chapter 249 (County Vehicular Taxes) 
that stated, in relevant part: "Each moped shall be issued a 
number plate upon payment of the initial annual registration fee 
pursuant to section 249-14." H.B. 1753, H.D. 3, 28th Leg., Reg. 
Sess. (2016) (emphasis added). 
However, in the Senate, the content of H.B. 1753, H.D. 
3 was deleted and replaced with the content of S.B. 2736, S.D. 1, 
"a substantially similar measure[.]" S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 
12 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
3061, in 2016 Senate Journal, at 1318. 
Notably, by replacing the 
content, the Senate amended the bill to require the issuance of a 
number plate for a moped "upon the original registration" rather 
than "upon payment of the initial annual registration fee." 
Compare H.B. 1753, H.D. 3, S.D. 1, 28th Leg., Reg. Sess. (2016), 
with H.B. 1753, H.D. 3, 28th Leg., Reg. Sess. (2016). The 
substitution of the language is significant because it made the 
issuance of a license plate dependent upon the "original 
registration" instead of an "initial annual registration fee." 
The legislative history of S.B. 2736 provides no explanation for 
the use of the phrase "upon the original registration." 
However, the senate standing committee report on H.B. 1753, H.D. 
3, S.D. 1 described one of the purposes of the measure as 
"[r]equir[ing] the Director of Finance to issue moped number 
plates upon payment of the initial moped and bicycle registration 
fee[.]" S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 3061, in 2016 Senate Journal, 
at 1318 (emphasis added). The senate standing committee report 
for the next Senate draft described the same purpose as 
"[r]equir[ing] the Director of Finance to issue a moped number 
plate and tag or emblem upon payment of fees[.]" S. Stand. Comm. 
Rep. No. 3599, in 2016 Senate Journal, at 1562 (emphasis added). 
The Senate draft of the bill also proposed that the new moped 
license plate requirement be created under HRS chapter 286 
(Highway Safety). H.B. 1753, H.D. 3, S.D. 1, 28th Leg., Reg. 
Sess. (2016). 
The conference committee report for H.B. 1753, H.D. 3, 
S.D. 2, C.D. 1 also did not provide an explanation for the phrase 
"upon the original registration." See Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 
158-16, in 2016 House Journal, at 1416-17, 2016 Senate Journal, 
at 842. It described one of the measure's purposes as 
"[r]equir[ing] the issuance of a moped number plate and tag or 
emblem upon payment of fees[.]" Id. (emphasis added). The 
conference committee also expressly proposed that HRS chapter 249 
was the more appropriate chapter to which the moped license plate 
13 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
requirement section should be added. Id. 
The legislative history does not provide an explanation 
for the phrase "upon the original registration" with regards to 
the issuance of a number plate and we must look to other sources 
for guidance. 
Although there is no statutory definition of "original
registration" with respect to mopeds, the phrase "original 
registration" is used multiple times in HRS chapter 249 in 
relation to vehicles. 
With respect to vehicles, HRS § 249-7 
(2017) states:  
§249-7 Number plates.  (a) Upon receipt of the tax
the director of finance shall number and register the
vehicle in the owner's name in a permanent record or book tobe kept by the director for this purpose, and shall furnishthe owner thereof with a receipt showing upon its face thelicense number issued for the vehicle and the fact that the license tax has been paid thereon for the whole or theremainder of the current year in which the receipt isissued. The director of finance shall also furnish the owner, upon the original registration of the vehicle, twonumber plates for the vehicle or one plate in the case oftrailers, semitrailers, or motorcycles with the registrationnumber marked thereon. Upon the payment of the tax for eachyear a tag or emblem bearing a serial number and the monthand year of expiration shall be provided to the owner.Transfer of current number plates, tag, or emblem, except asauthorized by this chapter or by chapter 286, is punishableby a fine of not more than $50 for each offense. 
(b) Upon an original registration the director of
finance shall fix, and shall charge to the owner, a feeequal to the cost of the number plate and tag or emblem plusthe administrative cost of furnishing the plate and tag oremblem and effecting the registration. Upon the issuance ofa new series of number plates as determined by the directorsof finance of each county through majority consent, thedirector of finance shall charge the owner a fee equal tothe costs of the number plate plus the administrative costof furnishing the plates. Upon issuing a tag or emblem, thedirector of finance shall charge the owner a fee of 50cents. The owner shall securely fasten the number plates onthe vehicle, one on the front and the other on the rear, ata location provided by the manufacturer or in the absence ofsuch a location upon the bumpers of the vehicle and inconformance with section 291-31, in such a manner as toprevent the plates from swinging. Number plates shall atall times be displayed entirely unobscured and be keptreasonably clean. In the case of trailers, semitrailers, ormotorcycles, one plate shall be used and it shall befastened to the rear thereof at a location provided by themanufacturer or in the absence of such a location at the rear thereof, and in the case of motorcycles in conformancewith section 291-31. 
14  
   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(c) Upon the issuance of the tag or emblem the owner
shall affix the tag or emblem to the top right portion of
the rear number plate, except that all vehicles owned by theState, any county government, any board of water supply, andofficial representatives of any foreign governments shall beissued registrations which need be renewed only in the newplate issue year. 
(d) After the initial payment of the tax and the
original registration of a vehicle as herein specified, amotor vehicle shall not be required to be reweighed in anysucceeding year unless it has been so altered or changed asto increase or diminish its weight. No new number platesshall, however, be issued to a new owner except as providedin sections 249-7.5 and 249-8. 
(e) If an owner of a vehicle registered in any
county, upon the disposition of the vehicle, requests thatthe license plates furnished to the owner with respect tothe registration of the vehicle be assigned to anothervehicle subsequently acquired by the owner, the assignmentmay be made by the director of finance at the director'sdiscretion. To defray additional administrative costsincurred by acceding to those requests, the director offinance shall charge a fee of $5 for each reassignment oflicense plates, in addition to the fee for registration.The procedure for registering the vehicles shall otherwisebe identical with that provided by this section. 
(Emphases added.) 
The license plate requirements for vehicles in HRS 
§ 249-7(a) and (b) are similar to the license plate requirement 
for mopeds in HRS § 249-14.1. Given the legislature's purposeful 
placement of the moped license plate requirement in HRS chapter 
249, see Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 158-16, in 2016 House Journal, at 
1416-17, 2016 Senate Journal, at 842, and the similarity of the 
statutes included therein, we look to laws dealing with vehicles 
to explain what is doubtful in HRS § 249-14.1. 
Under HRS § 249-7.5 (2017),4 an "original registration" 
4 HRS § 249-7.5 provides: 
§249-7.5   Ne w  motor  vehicle  with  a  temporary  number 
plate.   Any  person  who  has  purchased  a  new  motor  vehicle  which
has  attached  a  temporary  number  plate  under  section  286-53
shall  register  the  new  motor  vehicle  in  accordance  with  this
chapter  within  thirty  days  after  taking  possession  of  the
motor  vehicle.   For  the  purposes  of  this  chapter,  the
registration  of  such  a  motor  vehicle  shall  be  considered  an
original  registration  under  section  249-7.   Within  thirty  days
of  the  original  registration  of  such  a  motor  vehicle,  the
director  of  finance  shall  furnish  two  number  plates  and  the
valid  tag  or  emblem  appropriate  for  the  year  of  registration, 
15           
         
       
   
 
        
            
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
with respect to vehicles is the registration of a newly purchased 
vehicle within thirty days of taking possession by the owner. 
HRS § 249-7.5 also requires two number plates be issued within 
thirty days of the "original registration." 
Given the plain meaning of "original," the lack of a 
statutory definition of "original registration" as applied to 
mopeds, the lack of any discernible legislative intent about the 
purpose of the phrase "upon the original registration" as applied 
to mopeds in Act 200, and in consideration of laws in pari 
materia with HRS § 249-14.1 (specifically, HRS §§ 249-7 and 
249-7.5), we conclude that the phrase "upon the original 
registration" in HRS § 249-14.1 is only applicable to newly 
purchased and/or first time registration of a moped. The phrase 
does not include previously registered mopeds that became subject 
to an annual registration fee pursuant to Act 200. Since there 
is no statutory authority for the issuance of a license plate to 
previously registered mopeds, Langdon could not have properly 
received a license plate even if he had paid an annual 
registration fee. The legislature could not have intended the 
absurd result of fining a moped owner for failing to secure a 
license plate to the moped when no license plate was authorized 
to be issued. 
Because no license plate was authorized to be issued to 
Langdon for his previously registered moped, he was not in 
violation of HRS § 249-14.1 based on a failure to secure a 
license plate to the rear of his moped.5 
if any, which shall be attached to the motor vehicle as
provided under section 249-7. Upon attachment of the numberplates, the temporary number plate provided under section286-53 shall be destroyed. 
(Emphasis added.) 
5 This court expresses no opinion on whether the permanent
registration fee for mopeds registered pursuant to HRS § 249-14 may be modifiedby Act 200.
