Defendant-Appellant Association of Apartment Owners of 
Elima Lani Condominiums (Association) appeals from the Circuit 
Court of the Third Circuit's December 11, 2018 "Findings of 
Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting [Plaintiff-Appellee 
U.S. Bank Trust, N.A., as Trustee for LSF9 Master Participation 
Trust's (Bank)] Motion for Summary Judgment Against All NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
2 
 Defendants and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure" and 
Judgment.1 
  Upon careful review of the record and the briefs submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve 
Association's points of error below, and affirm.   
(1) Association contends that the "circuit court 
committed reversible error when it purportedly vested the 
Commissioner with and divested the Association of equitable 
title to the Property owned by the Association."  However, 
nowhere in its December 11, 2018 order or judgment did the 
circuit court purport to "vest" the Commissioner with title to 
the subject property.  See Bank of New York Mellon v. Larrua, 
150 Hawai‘ i 429, 445 n.18, 504 P.3d 1017, 1033 n.18 (App. 2022).   
(2) Association contends that 
The circuit court committed reversible error when it agreed 
with Lender that the right to possess and collect rental 
income from the Property was within the Commissioner's 
discretion upon the entry of the [motion for summary 
judgment] Order, and ordered the Commissioner "to take 
possession and control of the Property"  owned by the 
Association, including the collection and retention of rents.
   
 
We hold that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion by 
ordering the Commissioner "to take possession and control of the 
Property, including but not limited to collecting rental 
payments[.]"  These duties are "standard practice . . . to

 facilitate a foreclosure sale and ensure preservation of the 
Property for the subsequent purchaser, after the entry of the 
foreclosure decree and judgment."  Id. at 441, 504 P.3d at 1029.
Further, "[u]nder Hawai‘ i law, a judgment entered on a 
foreclosure decree is a final determination of a foreclosed 
party's ownership interests in the subject property . . . 
notwithstanding that further proceedings are necessary to enforce and otherwise effectuate the foreclosure decree and 
judgment."  Id. at 431, 504 P.3d at 1019.   
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the circuit court's 
December 11, 2018 "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and 
Order Granting [Bank's] Motion for Summary Judgment Against All 
Defendants and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure" and 
Judgment.
