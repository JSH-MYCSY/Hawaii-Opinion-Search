APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
NORTH AND SOUTH KONA DIVISION 
(CIVIL NO. 3RC18-1-106K) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL 
(By:  Reifurth, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that: 
(1)
 On January 3, 2019, Real Party in Interest-
Appellant Tony Silva (Silva), pro se, conventionally filed the notice of appeal; 
(2)
 On January 4, 2019, the district court clerk 
electronically filed the notice of appeal to create case number 
CAAP-19-0000010.  Because Silva did not submit the appellate 
filing and docketing fees with the notice of appeal, as required 
by Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 3(a), the 
district court clerk notified Silva to pay the fees or request a fee waiver by January 18, 2019, or the appeal could be dismissed; 
(3) On January 31, 2019, Silva filed a document that 
is, among other things, a motion to consolidate case number CAAP-
19-0000010 with case number CAAP-19-0000005; NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(4) On March 14, 2019, the appellate clerk entered a 
default of the record on appeal, informing Silva that the time to 
docket the appeal expired on March 5, 2019, he had not paid the 
filing fee or obtained an order allowing him to proceed on appeal 
in forma pauperis, the matter would be brought to the court's 
attention on March 25, 2019, for action that may include 
dismissal of the appeal, and he could seek relief from default by 
motion.  The appellate clerk mailed the default notice to Silva 
at three different addresses, including the address provided in 
the notice of appeal and the January 31, 2019 motion, and the 
U.S. Postal Service returned one of the envelopes as 
undeliverable; 
(5) Silva took no further action in this appeal; and (6)
 An appeal may be dismissed where the record on 
appeal has not been prepared because the appellant failed to pay 
the required fees or obtain an order allowing the appellant to 
proceed in forma pauperis
.  HRAP Rule 11(b)(2), (c)(2). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are 
dismissed.
