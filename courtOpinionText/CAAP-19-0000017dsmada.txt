A
PPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
NORTH AND SOUTH KONA DIVISION 
(CIVIL NO. 3RC18-1-105K) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
appellate jurisdiction over Non-Party/Appellant Felise Auaea's 
(Auaea), pro se, appeal from the Honorable Margaret K. Masunaga's 
December 4, 2018 judgment for possession in favor of Plaintiff-
Appellee Free Church of Tonga-Kona (Free Church of Tonga-Kona) 
and against Defendant-Appellee Church of Tonga (Church of Tonga) 
in Civil No. 3RC18-1-105K.  Auaea was not a party at the time 
when the January 3, 2019 notice of appeal was submitted to the 
circuit court clerk for filing.  Therefore, Auaea lacks standing 
to appeal. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Generally, the requirements of standing to appeal are:
(1) the person must first have been a party to the action;(2) the person seeking modification of the order or judgment
must have had standing to oppose it in the trial court; and(3) such person must be aggrieved by the ruling, i.e., the
person must be one who is affected or prejudiced by theappealable order.

(citations and internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis in 
original). 
Auaea also had no right to appear as an attorney on 
behalf of Church of Tonga in this litigation, because Auaea is 
not licensed to practice law in Hawai# i.  It is not clear from 
Free Church of Tonga-Kona's March 21, 2018 complaint exactly what type of entity Church of Tonga is, but Church of Tonga appears to 
be an organization that is distinct from any individual member 
within it.  Under HRS § 605-2 (2016) and HRS § 605-14 (2016), 
non-attorneys such as Auaea "are not permitted to act as 
'attorneys' and represent other natural persons in their causes."

Haw. 372, 377, 590 P.2d 570, 573 (1979) (citations and footnote 
omitted; original emphasis).  "By the same token, non-attorney 
agents are not allowed to represent corporations in litigation, 
for a wholly unintended exception to the rules against 
unauthorized practice of law would otherwise result."  Id. at 
377, 590 P.2d at 574 (footnote omitted).  
Unlike lay agents of corporations, attorneys are subject to
professional rules of conduct and are amenable todisciplinary action ... for violations of ethical standards.Therefore, attorneys, being fully accountable to the courts,are properly designated to act as the representatives ofcorporations.

International, Inc. v. The Malulani Group, Ltd., 814 F.3d 1046, 
1053 (9th Cir. 2016) ("A corporation must be represented by 
counsel.").  With respect to trusts, "[t]he general rule is that a trustee may not represent the trust in litigation unless, 
having the right sought to be enforced, he is the real party in 
interest."  Tradewinds Hotel, Inc. v. Conchran, 8 Haw. App. 256, 
265, 799 P.2d 60, 65 (1990).  "Similar considerations apply to 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
partnerships, and have led most courts to conclude that a 
partnership may only appear in court through counsel."  In re 
ICLNDS Notes Acquisition, LLC, 259 B.R. 289, 293–94 (Bankr. N.D. 
Ohio 2001); cf. Beamer v. Nishiki, 66 Haw. 572, 588, 670 P.2d 
1264, 1276 (1983) ("Regardless of whether [a dissolved entity 
named] The Valley Isle was a corporation or partnership, 
therefore, [former stockholders or partners] Moore and Silva are 
real parties in interest and [the non-attorney dissolution 
trustee] Reed's attempt to appear on behalf of the dissolved The 
Valley Isle is actually an appearance on behalf of Moore and 
Silva. . . .  Reed's activities thus constitute the unauthorized 
practice of law.  Therefore, Reed, as trustee, will not be 
allowed to continue pro se in his practice of law representing 
The Valley Isle.").  Similarly, regardless "whether an LLC is 
viewed as a corporation or a partnership or a hybrid, it may only 
appear in court through an attorney."  In re ICLNDS Notes 
Acquisition, LLC, 259 B.R. at 294. 
If Church of Tonga is an unincorporated entity 
consisting of multiple members, it might fit the definition of a 
"nonprofit association" under HRS § 429-1 (2004): 
"Nonprofit association" means an unincorporated
organization, other than one created by a trust, consisting
of two or more members joined by mutual consent for acommon, nonprofit purpose. However, joint tenancy, tenancyin common, or tenancy by the entireties does not by itselfestablish a nonprofit association, even if the co-ownersshare use of the property for a nonprofit purpose. 
(Quoted in part).  A nonprofit association is "a legal entity 
separate from its members for the purposes of determining and 
enforcing rights, duties, and liabilities in contract and tort." 
HRS § 429-6(a) (2004).  HRS § 429-7 (2004), HRS § 429-10 (2004), 
HRS § 429-11 (2004) and HRS § 429-13 (2004) indicate that a 
nonprofit association has the legal capacity to assert or defend 
a legal cause of action in its name, separate and distinct from 
any one member within it.  The same laws barring a non-attorney 
from representing another natural person, a corporation, a 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
partnership, a trust, or a limited liability company would also 
bar a non-attorney from representing a non-profit association. 
In sum, a non-attorney such as Auaea is not allowed to 
represent another party in this litigation, regardless whether 
the other party is a natural person, a corporation, a 
partnership, a trust, a limited liability company, or an 
unincorporated organization.  In fact, "[a]ny person violating 
sections 605-14 to 605-16 shall be guilty of a misdemeanor."  HRS 
§ 605-17 (2016).  Absent an appeal by a party in the underlying 
case, we lack appellate jurisdiction. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
