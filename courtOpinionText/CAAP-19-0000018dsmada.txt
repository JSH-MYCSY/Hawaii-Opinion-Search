AB, Petitioner-Cross-Respondent/Appellee, v.
MF, Respondent-Cross-Petitioner/Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
(FC-P NO. 18-1-0175)  
ORDER 
(1) GRANTING MARCH 12, 2019 MOTION TO DETERMINE
APPELLATE JURISDICTION AND 
(
2) DISMISSING APPELLATE COURT CASE NUMBER
CAAP-19-0000018 FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Reifurth, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Upon review of (1) Respondent-Cross-Petitioner/ 
Appellant MF's (MF) March 12, 2019 motion to determine appellate 
jurisdiction, (2) the record, and noting (3) the lack of any 
memorandum by Petitioner-Cross-Respondent/Appellee AB (AB) in 
response to MF's March 12, 2019 motion, it appears that we lack 
appellate jurisdiction over MF's appeal from the Honorable Lloyd 
A. Poelman's December 6, 2018 "Expedited Order Regarding 
Visitation, Child Support, and Denying Motion to Amend Findings 
of Fact and Conclusions of Law" and November 15, 2018 findings of 
fact, conclusions of law and order denying with prejudice MF's 
cross-petition to terminate AB's parental rights over their minor 
child, because the family court has not yet entered a final 
judgment, final order or final decree that finally determines the 
last remaining and unresolved substantive issues of AB's petition NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
for paternity, child custody and child support in FC-P No. 18-1-
0175, as Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 571-54 (2018) requires 
for a paternity action. 
In family court cases "[a]n interested party, aggrieved 
by any order or decree of the court, may appeal to the 
intermediate appellate court for review of questions of law and 
fact upon the same terms and conditions as in other cases in the 
circuit court, and review shall be governed by chapter 602, 
except as hereinafter provided." 
HRS § 571-54. In circuit 
courts, HRS § 641-1(a) (2016) authorizes appeals from a final judgment, order or decree. No published opinion requires a 
family court to reduce a final order or decision to a separate 
judgment for the purpose of perfecting an aggrieved party's right 
to appeal. See, e.g., In Interest of Doe, 77 Hawai# i 109, 114 
n.9, 883 P.2d 30, 35 n.9 (1994) ("We note that, due to the nature of a 'final' judgment in child custody cases, the requirements 
for appealability set forth in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & 
Wright, 76 
Hawai# i 115, 869 P.2d 1334 (Sup.1994), are 
inapplicable in such custody cases."). Consequently, under HRS § 571-54, "appeals in family court cases, as in other civil 
cases, may be taken only from (1) a final judgment, order, or 
decree, see HRS §§ 571-54 (1993) and 641-1(a) (1993), or 
(2) a certified interlocutory order. See HRS § 641-1(b) (1993)." 
In re Doe, 96 Hawai# i 272, 283, 30 P.3d 878, 889 (2001); In re 
Doe, 102 Hawai# i 246, 249 n.4, 74 P.3d 998, 1001 n.4 (2003) 
(Explaining that HRS § 641-1(b) applies to family court cases, 
and, thus, a "Minor could have applied to the family court for 
certification of the order denying his motion to suppress 
evidence."). 
In the instant case, neither the December 6, 2018 order 
nor the November 15, 2018 findings of fact, conclusions of law 
and order finally determined, and thus ended, the paternity 
proceedings in FC-P No. 18-1-0175, leaving nothing further for 
the family court to accomplish. For example, the family court 
has not yet expressly adjudicated the long term child custody,

visitation, and support issues. Unlike the cases cited in 
support by MF, the instant case does not involve any attempt by a 
government entity to infringe on the parties' parental rights by 
way of foster custody or the termination of parental rights, but, 
instead, involves the resolution of parental rights between two 
private parties as to their child. None of the recognized 
exceptions to the finality requirement apply in this case. See 
Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai# i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995); 
Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 
Hawai# i 319, 322, 
966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding the three requirements for 
the collateral order doctrine); HRS § 641-1(b) (regarding the 
requirements for an appeal from an interlocutory order). Absent 
a final judgment, final order, or final decree, MF's appeal is 
premature, and we lack appellate jurisdiction over appellate 
court case number CAAP-19-0000018. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that MF's March 12, 
2019 motion to determine appellate jurisdiction is granted. 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case 
number CAAP-19-0000018 is dismissed for lack of appellate 
jurisdiction.
