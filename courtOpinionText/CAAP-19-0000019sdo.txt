Dkt. 86 SONOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Bank of America , N.A. filed the complaint below on
April 25, 2012.  Representing herself, Taguiped answered the
complaint on July 22, 2014, and served Bank of America's counsel. The circuit court erroneously entered Taguiped's default onSeptember 2, 2014.  Wilmington  Savings Fund Society, FSB
substituted as the plaintiff on March 21, 2018.  Wilmington moved
for summary judgment and a decree of foreclosure on September 25,2018.  The court entered the Order and the Judgment onDecember 14, 2018.  This appeal followed.
Taguiped argues that her liability on her promissory
note was discharged in bankruptcy.  Her discharge protects herfrom personal liability under the note, but it doesn't preventWilmington from foreclosing on her mortgage.  Johnson v. Home
State Bank , 501 U.S. 78, 82-83 (1991).Taguiped argues that Wilmington didn't prove Bank of
America's standing to enforce her note when it filed thecomplaint, as required by Bank of Am., N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo
, 139
Hawai#i 361, 390 P.3d 1248 (2017).  A copy of the note wasn't
attached to the complaint.  Wilmington's motion for summaryjudgment included a copy of the note, authenticated by adeclaration of Joanna Dyer.  The note was payable to Countrywide
Bank, FSB.  It was indorsed in blank by Countrywide.  There is no
date on the indorsement.  The note does not show when Bank ofAmerica became the holder.
Dyer was "an authorized signer of . . . [Wilmington]'s
servicing agent[,]" Fay Servicing LLC.  The information in her
declaration was "taken from Fay's business records."  Fay became
Wilmington's loan servicer on March 7, 2017.  BSI Financial
Services and Bank of America serviced the loan before Fay.  Dyer
stated:
37. According to [BSI and Bank of America]'s
records, [Bank of America] was in possession of the originalNote, indorsed in blank, prior to 04/25/2012, the date ofthe filing of the Complaint.
According to Dyer, "Fay did review and determine [BSI
and Bank of America]'s business records were trustworthy
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
otherwise it would not have incorporated it into its own
records."  But Dyer's declaration didn't show circumstancesindicating trustworthiness of the incorporated records, asrequired under Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Behrendt
, 142 Hawai #i
37, 45-46, 414 P.3d 89, 97-98 (2018).  Compare  U.S. Bank Tr.,
N.A. v. Verhagen , 149 Hawai #i 315, 325-26, 489 P.3d 419, 429-30
(2021) (discussing "scant" and "nebulously described"circumstances indicating trustworthiness of incorporatedrecords), with
 Deutsche Bank Nat'l Tr. Co. v. Yata , 152 Hawai #i
322, 334-35, 526 P.3d 299, 311-12 (2023) (noting that thirdBehrendt
 requirement wasn't satisfied).  Dyer's declaration
didn't specify how Fay determined that the incorporated recordswere trustworthy.  The declaration didn't establish admissibilityof the note or other incorporated records under Hawaii Rules ofEvidence Rule 803(b)(6).  Wilmington did not show that Bank ofAmerica had standing to enforce the note when it filed theforeclosure complaint.  The circuit court erred by grantingWilmington's motion for summary judgment.
Taguiped's other arguments are without merit.  The
"Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order GrantingPlaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment Against All Defendantsand for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure" and the "Judgment,"both entered on December 14, 2018, are vacated, and this case isremanded to the circuit court for further proceedings consistentwith this summary disposition order.
