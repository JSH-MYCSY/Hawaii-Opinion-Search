APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 5RC-18-1-0269) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL 
(By: 
Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Chan, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that: 
(1) On March 8, 2019, the court ordered that within 
ten days from the date of the order, pro se Defendant-Appellant Scott Kuroiwa (Kuroiwa) shall show cause indicating why the 
appeal should not be dismissed for failure to pay the filing fee 
or obtain a fee waiver. The court cautioned Kuroiwa that failure 
to timely respond to the order or to show good cause may result 
in dismissal of the appeal; 
(2) 
The appellate clerk mailed the order to show cause 
to Kuroiwa's address listed on in the notice of appeal, record on 
appeal and supplemental record on appeal but the United States 
Postal Service returned the envelope as undeliverable and unable 
to forward. 
Kuroiwa did not file a notice of change of address, 
consistent with Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 
Rule 25(f); NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(3) The time for Kuroiwa to pay the filing fee or 
obtain a fee waiver expired March 5, 2019. 
See HRAP Rule 
11(b)(1) & (2). Kuroiwa did not respond to the order to show 
cause, pay the filing fee, request a fee waiver, or take any 
further action in this appeal; and 
(4) An appeal may be dismissed where the appellant 
failed to pay the required fee or obtain an order allowing the 
appellant to proceed in forma pauperis
.  HRAP Rule 11(b)(2), 
(c)(2). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed.
