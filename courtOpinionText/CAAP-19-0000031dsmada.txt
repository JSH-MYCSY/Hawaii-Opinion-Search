OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI#I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
MARIO D. COOPER, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
(CASE NO. 5DTI-18-103756)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By:  Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Hiraoka, JJ.)
Upon review of the records in CAAP-19-0000031, it
appears that this court lacks appellate jurisdiction.  Defendant-
Appellant Mario D. Cooper (Appellant) appeals from the
Judgment/Order and Notice of Entry of Judgment/Order entered on
December 7, 2018 in the District Court of the Fifth Circuit
finding that he violated HRS ยง 291C-102(a)(1) (2007).  Pursuant
to Rules 4(a) and 26(a) of the Hawai#i Rules of Appellate
Procedure (HRAP), Appellant had until Monday, January 7, 2019, to
file his notice of appeal from the December 7, 2018
Judgment/Order and Notice of Entry of Judgment/Order. 
Appellant's Notice of Appeal was filed on January 8, 2019, more
than thirty days after entry of the December 7, 2018
Judgment/Order and Notice of Entry of Judgment/Order.  Therefore,
the appeal was untimely.  "[C]ompliance with the requirement of
the timely filing of a notice of appeal is jurisdictional." NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, September 25, 2019.
