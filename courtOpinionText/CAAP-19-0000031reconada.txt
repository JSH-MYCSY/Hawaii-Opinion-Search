IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI#I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
MARIO D. COOPER, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
(CASE NO. 5DTI-18-103756)
ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
(By:  Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Hiraoka, JJ.)
Upon consideration of the Motion for Reconsideration,
filed on September 26, 2019, by Defendant-Appellant Mario D.
Cooper (Appellant), citing Rule 21 (b) of the Hawaii Civil
Traffic Rules (HCTR) and Si-Nor v. Director, Dept. of Lab. and
Indus. Rel., 120 Hawai# i 135, 202 P.3d 596 (App. 2009), for the
proposition the mailing date is the effective filing date,
Appellant contends his mailing of the Notice of Appeal on
January 2, 2019, constituted the filing date, five days prior to
the filing deadline on January 7, 2019, pursuant to Rule 4(a) of
the Hawai i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP).  
HRAP Rule 4 governs the deadline to file a Notice of
Appeal, not HCTR Rule 21.  Si-Nor involved this court's review of
an agency's interpretation of its own administrative rules
regarding the timely filing of a Notice of Contest.  Si-Nor, 120
Hawai i at 146-47, 202 P.3d at 607-08.  Si-Nor does not involve
an interpretation of HRAP Rule 4, thus, it is inapplicable.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
HRAP Rule 25(a) states "Physical documents may be
submitted by conventional mail addressed to the appellate clerk,
but filing shall not be considered timely unless the documents
are received by the clerk within the time fixed for filing[.]" 
There is nothing in the record on appeal to suggest the Notice of
Appeal was received prior to January 8, 2019, when it was filed.  
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion for
Reconsideration is denied.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, September 30, 2019.
