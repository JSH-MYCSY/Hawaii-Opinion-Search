STATE OF HAWAI#I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
 JODY BUDDEMEYER, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 3PC16100331K) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Nakasone, JJ.) 
This case arises from a March 1, 2015 incident 
involving on-duty police officer, Defendant-Appellant Jody 
Buddemeyer (Buddemeyer), striking and killing a bicyclist with 
his police vehicle. On October 11, 2016, a Hawai#i County grand 
jury indicted Buddemeyer on three charges: (1) Count One, 
Negligent Homicide in the First Degree;1 (2) Count Two, Tampering 
with Physical Evidence;2 and (3) Count Three, False Reporting to 
Law Enforcement Authorities.3 On January 4, 2017, the Circuit 
Court of the Third Circuit (Circuit Court)4  entered an order 
1 Hawai #i Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 707-702.5(1)(2014). 
2 HRS § 710-1076(1)(2014). 
3 HRS § 710-1015(1)(2014). 
4 The Honorable Melvin H. Fujino presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
granting Buddemeyer's oral motion to suspend proceedings pending 
completion of a three-panel examination of Buddemeyer's fitness 
to proceed to trial, and Buddemeyer's cognitive or volitional 
capacity at the time of the alleged conduct. See Hawai#i Revised 
Statutes (HRS) §§ 704-404 (2014), -407.5 (2016). The Circuit 
Court's order, in part, tasked the panel experts with reporting 
their opinion (1) "as to the extent, if any, to which the 
cognitive and/or volitional capacity of Defendant, i.e., the 
capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of Defendant's conduct 
and/or to conform Defendant's conduct to the requirements of the 
law, was impaired at the time of the conduct alleged" and (2) "as 
to the capacity of Defendant to have a particular state of mind 
which is required to establish an element of the offense 
charged." On February 23, 2017, the Circuit Court entered an 
order resuming the proceedings, after reviewing the panel 
experts' reports and finding that Buddemeyer was fit to proceed 
to trial. 
A jury trial was held beginning October 2, 2018, and 
verdicts were entered on October 12, 2018. 
The three court-
ordered panel experts testified at trial. The first expert, psychiatrist Dr. Andrew Bisset, testified that no conclusions 
could be drawn about Buddemeyer's volitional capacity because 
Buddemeyer had no psychiatric history prior to the alleged 
negligent homicide. The second expert, forensic psychologist Dr. 
Frederic Manke, testified that at the time Buddemeyer struck the 
bicyclist, he had no undiagnosed previous mental illness and that 
Buddemeyer's volitional capacity was not impaired by the effects 
of mental disease, disorder or defect; but Dr. Manke also 
testified that he lacked the necessary qualifications in the 
field of psychiatry to render any opinion whether Buddemeyer 
suffered from a neurocognitive disorder, such as acute fatigue 
work-shift disorder. The third expert, psychiatrist Dr. Henry H. 
Yang (Dr. Yang), opined that Buddemeyer's "capacity to appreciate 
the wrongfulness of his conduct was significantly impaired by a 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
neurocognitive disorder, or the medical condition of [a] sleep 
disorder" at the time of the alleged negligent homicide.5 The 
jury found Buddemeyer (1) guilty as to Count One of the lesser-
included offense of Negligent Homicide in the Third Degree (NH3); 
(2) not guilty as to Count Two; and (3) not guilty as to Count 
Three. 
Buddemeyer appeals from the Judgment, entered on 
December 12, 2018, convicting him of the lesser-included offense 
of NH3 in violation of HRS § 707-704 (2014).6 On appeal, 
Buddemeyer contends the Circuit Court erred in denying his post-verdict Motion for Acquittal.
7 Specifically, Buddemeyer argues 
the Circuit Court erred because the State presented no evidence 
5 In addition to Dr. Yang's expert report, Dr. Yang attached a study
regarding sleep disorders in police officers, which the jury had access to for
its deliberations. 
6 The offense of NH3 is set forth in HRS § 707-704 as follows: 
§707-704 Negligent homicide in the third degree . (1)
A person is guilty of the offense of negligent homicide inthe third degree if that person causes the death of anotherperson by the operation of a vehicle in a manner which issimple negligence.
(2) "Simple negligence" as used in this section:(a) A person acts with simple negligence with
respect to the person's conduct when the personshould be aware of a risk that the personengages in that conduct.
(b) A person acts with simple negligence with
respect to attendant circumstances when theperson should be aware of a risk that thosecircumstances exist. 
(c) A person acts with simple negligence with
respect to a result of the person's conduct whenthe person should be aware of a risk that theperson's conduct will cause that result.
(d) A risk is within the meaning of this subsection
if the person's failure to perceive it,considering the nature and purpose of the
person's conduct and the circumstances known to
the person, involves a deviation from thestandard of care that a law-abiding person wouldobserve in the same situation. 
(3) Negligent homicide in the third degree is a
misdemeanor. 
7 On October 12, 2018, the jury entered a guilty verdict against
Buddemeyer as to the NH3 charge. On October 22, 2023, Buddemeyer filed apost-verdict Motion for Judgment of Acquittal. 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to contradict expert testimony allegedly supportive of 
Buddemeyer's affirmative defense of lack of penal responsibility 
for reason of mental disease, disorder, or defect.8 See HRS 
§ 701-115 (2014);9 HRS § 704-402 (2014).10 Therefore, Buddemeyer 
contends, "the jury could not have concluded that [Buddemeyer] 
maintained sufficient mental capacity as a matter of law" to be 
8 At trial, Buddemeyer asserted as an affirmative defense that his
"capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct was significantly
impaired by a neurocognitive disorder or the medical condition of sleepdisorder." 
9 HRS § 701-115 provides, in relevant part: 
§701-115 Defenses . (1) A defense is a fact or set of
facts which negatives penal responsibility.
(2) No defense may be considered by the trier of fact
unless evidence of the specified fact or facts has beenpresented. If such evidence is presented then: 
. . . 
(b) If the defense is an affirmative defense, the
defendant is entitled to an acquittal if the
trier of fact finds that the evidence, whenconsidered in light of any contrary prosecutionevidence, proves by a preponderance of theevidence the specified fact or facts whichnegative penal liability.
(3) A defense is an affirmative defense if: (a) It is specifically so designated by the Code or
another statute[.] 
10  HRS § 704-402 provides: 
HRS § 704-402. Physical or mental disease, disorder,
or defect excluding responsibility is an affirmative
defense; form of verdict when finding of irresponsibility ismade. (1) Physical or mental disease, disorder, or defect
excluding responsibility is an affirmative defense.
(2) When the defense provided for by subsection (1)
is submitted to a jury, the court shall, if requested by the
defendant, instruct the jury as to the consequences to the
defendant of an acquittal on the ground of physical ormental disease, disorder, or defect excludingresponsibility.
(3) When the defendant is acquitted on the ground of
physical or mental disease, or defect excluding responsibility,the verdict and the judgment shall so state.

convicted of NH3 pursuant to HRS § 707-704.11 
For the reasons discussed below, we affirm. 
I. Discussion 
The Circuit Court did not err in denying Buddemeyer's 
Motion for Judgment of Acquittal. When reviewing the grant or 
denial of a post-verdict motion for a judgment of acquittal, 
we employ the same standard that a trial court applies to
such a motion, namely, whether, upon the evidence viewed inthe light most favorable to the prosecution and in fullrecognition of the province of the trier of fact, theevidence is sufficient to support a prima facie case so thata reasonable mind might fairly conclude guilt beyond areasonable doubt. Sufficient evidence to support a primafacie case requires substantial evidence as to everymaterial element of the offense charged. Substantial evidence as to every material element of the offense chargedis credible evidence which is of sufficient quality andprobative value to enable a person of reasonable caution tosupport a conclusion. Under such a review, we give fullplay to the right of the fact finder to determinecredibility, weigh the evidence, and draw justifiableinferences of fact. 
State v. Timoteo, 87 Hawai#i 108, 112-13, 952 P.2d 865, 869-70 
(1997) (quoting State v. Jhun, 83 Hawai# i 472, 481, 927 P.2d 
1355, 1364 (1996)). 
Furthermore, we note that when a defendant claims lack 
of penal responsibility as an affirmative defense, they bear "the 
burden of going forward with the evidence to prove facts 
constituting the defense and of proving such facts by a 
preponderance of the evidence." State v. Uyesugi, 100 Hawai#i 
442, 456, 60 P.3d 843, 857 (2002) (quoting State v. Fukusaku, 85 Hawai#i 462, 481, 946 P.2d 32, 51 (1997)). When a jury finds a 
defendant guilty, it is an indication that the defendant did not meet their burden of proving their affirmative defense. See id. 
at 459, 60 P.3d at 860 (explaining that the jury must first 
11 Conviction for NH3 under HRS § 707-704 requires, inter alia , simple
negligence for which the statute provides a mental state that "the person
should be aware of a risk" regarding the person's conduct, the attendantcircumstances, and that the person's conduct will cause the specified result.See HRS § 707-704(2)(a)-(c). Further, HRS § 707-704(2)(d) sets forth themeaning of "risk" for purposes of that subsection. 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
unanimously determine whether the prosecution met its burden of 
proof before proceeding to unanimously determine whether the 
defendant met their burden in proving the affirmative defense).12 
First, we address Buddemeyer's contention that the 
State was required to produce contrary evidence to undermine the 
court-ordered expert opinion of psychiatrist Dr. Yang, as to  
Buddemeyer's incapacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his 
conduct due to an alleged sleep disorder. We note that 
Buddemeyer fails to cite to any authority in his opening brief or 
elsewhere to support this contention. See Hawai#i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(7).13 To the extent 
Buddemeyer's argument is based on the plain language of HRS § 701-115(2)(b) regarding affirmative defenses, the argument 
lacks merit. The plain language of HRS § 701-115(2)(b) provides: 
"[i]f the defense is an affirmative defense, the defendant is 
entitled to an acquittal if the trier of fact finds that the 
evidence, when considered in the light of any contrary 
prosecution evidence, proves by a preponderance of the evidence 
12  In explaining the order in which a jury must consider a defendant's
affirmative defense during its deliberations, the Hawai #i Supreme Court has
instructed that: 
The jury must unanimously determine whether the prosecution
met its burden of proof. Only then should the jury proceedto a determination of whether the defendant met his or her burden in proving the affirmative defense. Whether the defendant met his or her burden must be determined by aunanimous decision of the jury. If the jury hassuccessfully proceeded this far in its deliberations, it may
then consider the proper verdict. If the jury fails to
reach unanimity as to the affirmative defense, the circuitcourt must declare a mistrial due to a hung jury. 
Uyesugi, 100 Hawai #i at 459, 60 P.3d at 860 (emphasis added).  
13  HRAP 28(b)(7) provides that an appellant's opening brief must
include: "[t]he argument, containing the contentions of the appellant on thepoints presented and the reasons therefor, with citations to the authorities,statutes and parts of the record relied on." (Emphasis added). Further, underHRAP 28(b)(7), "[p]oints not argued may be deemed waived." 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the specified fact or facts which negative penal liability." The 
plain language of HRS § 701-115(2)(b) does not require that the 
prosecution provide rebuttal evidence, it merely acknowledges the 
trier of fact is to consider such evidence, if any, in its 
deliberations. Thus, under the plain language of the statute the 
prosecution was not required to produce rebuttal or contrary 
evidence as to Buddemeyer's affirmative defense that he lacked 
volitional capacity to be convicted of negligent homicide. 
Furthermore, to the extent Buddemeyer's argument is 
premised on the weight the jury gave to the parties' conflicting 
evidence and/or the credibility of the expert witnesses, we note 
that ordinarily, the weight a jury gives to evidence is not 
subject to review. "[T]his court will not attempt to reconcile 
conflicting evidence, or interfere with a jury decision based on 
the credibility of witnesses or the weight of the evidence. The 
jury's finding of the requisite elements of the crime charged is 
clearly reflected in its verdict." State v. Gabrillo, 10 Haw. 
App. 448, 457, 877 P.2d 891, 895 (App. 1994) (internal quotation 
marks, citations, brackets, and ellipses omitted). "Verdicts 
based on conflicting evidence will not be set aside where there 
is substantial evidence to support the trier of fact's findings." 
State v. Sua, 92 Hawai#i 61, 69, 987 P.2d 959, 967 (1999) 
(brackets omitted) (quoting Aga v. Hundahl, 78 Hawai# i 230, 237, 
891 P.2d 1022, 1029 (1995)). Here, given the conflicting 
testimony of the experts and because the jury unanimously found 
Buddemeyer guilty of NH3, this indicates that the jury found he 
did not meet his burden of proving his affirmative defense. See 
Uyesugi, 100 Hawai# i at 459, 60 P.3d at 860; State v. Young, 93 
Hawai#i 224, 231-32, 999 P.2d 230, 237-38 (2000); State v. 
Lanoza, No. CAAP-14-0001393, 2017 WL 2800025, at *3-4 (Haw. App. 
June 28, 2017) (mem. op).

Indeed, the jury was asked the following "Special 
Interrogatory as to Count 1 the Included offense of Negligent 
Homicide in the Third Degree": 
If you find the defendant Guilty as to the offense of
Negligent Homicide in the Third Degree, then you must answerthe following. Your answer to each question must beunanimous. Did the defendant prove the following by apreponderance of the evidence: 
1. At the time of the charged offense, the defendant was
suffering from a physical or mental disease, disorder,
or defect; and 
2. As a result of such physical or mental disease,
disorder, or defect, defendant lacked substantial
capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of hisconduct or to conform his conduct to the requirementsof the law? 
The jury answered this interrogatory in the negative. 
Finally, because Buddemeyer's sole contention on appeal 
is regarding the State's failure to provide rebuttal evidence to 
Buddemeyer's affirmative defense, we need not address the 
sufficiency of the evidence beyond our discussion above. 
II. Conclusion 
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the Circuit Court's 
"Judgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence; Notice of Entry 
of Judgment" entered December 10, 2018, and the Circuit Court's 
denial of Appellant's Motion for Judgment of Acquittal entered 
November 30, 2018.
