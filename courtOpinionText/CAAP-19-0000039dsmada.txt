IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
IN THE INTEREST OF CTG-K, A Minor
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
(FC-J NO. 0037211 (Report No. C12023339/SK)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By:  Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Hiraoka, JJ.)
Upon review of this appeal filed by Plaintiff-Appellant
State of Hawai#i (State), from the Honorable Mahilani E.K.
Hiatt's December 17, 2018 order dismissing with prejudice the
State's petition in family court case number FC-J 0037211, it
appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction because the
procedural requirements for appeal pursuant to HRS § 571-54 were
not met.
On March 2, 2017, the State filed a petition under HRS
§ 571-11(1) alleging that CTG-K violated a criminal statute.  On
October 23, 2018, CTG-K filed a motion to dismiss the petition
with prejudice for violations of due process.  Subsequent to a
hearing on the said motion, the family court entered the
December 17, 2018 order dismissing with prejudice the State's
petition.  The State did not file a motion for reconsideration,
and as such, no hearing on the said motion was had, and no
findings of fact and conclusions of law related to
reconsideration were entered by the family court.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
HRS § 571-54 (2018) states, in pertinent part:
An order or decree entered in a proceeding based upon
section 571-11(1), (2), or (6) shall be subject to appeal
only as follows:
Within twenty days from the date of the entry of any
such order or decree, any party directly affected thereby
may file a motion for a reconsideration of the facts
involved. The motion and any supporting affidavit shall set
forth the grounds on which a reconsideration is requested
and shall be sworn to by the movant or the movant's
representative. The judge shall hold a hearing on the
motion, affording to all parties concerned the full right of
representation by counsel and presentation of relevant
evidence. The findings of the judge upon the hearing of the
motion and the judge's determination and disposition of the
case thereafter, and any decision, judgment, order, or
decree affecting the child and entered as a result of the
hearing on the motion, shall be set forth in writing and
signed by the judge. Any party aggrieved by any such
findings, judgment, order, or decree shall have the right to
appeal therefrom to the intermediate appellate court, upon
the same terms and conditions as in other cases in the
circuit court, and review shall be governed by chapter 602;
provided that no such motion for reconsideration shall
operate as a stay of any such findings, judgment, order, or
decree unless the judge of the family court so orders; and
provided further that no informality or technical
irregularity in the proceedings prior to the hearing on the
motion for reconsideration shall constitute grounds for the
reversal of any such findings, judgment, order, or decree by
the appellate court.
"HRS § 571–54 and the case law interpreting the statute
make clear that a party wishing to perfect the right to appeal
must move the family court to reconsider its final order or
decree prior to divesting it of jurisdiction through the filing
of a notice of appeal."  In re Doe, 102 Hawai#i 246, 252, 74 P.3d
998, 1004 (2003).  In the same case, the Hawai#i Supreme Court
cited In re Doe, 3 Haw. App. 391, 394, 651 P.2d 492, 494 (1982),
"noting that a party need not petition the court to reconsider
its order or decree, but 'if he [or she] intends to appeal the
decision, he [or she] must" move for reconsideration."  Doe, 102
Hawai#i at 251–52, 74 P.3d at 1003–04. Ultimately, the supreme
court in Doe concluded that "the procedural requirements of HRS
§ 571–54 were clearly not met because Minor did not move for
reconsideration of the disposition of the case, no hearing to
reconsider the disposition was held, and no final written
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
judgment, order, or decree containing the findings and
conclusions on which the family court based its disposition was
entered."  Doe, 102 Hawai#i at 252, 74 P.3d at 1004. 
Accordingly, the supreme court concluded "we have no alternative
but to dismiss this case for lack of appellate jurisdiction." 
Doe, 102 Hawai# i at 252, 74 P.3d at 1004.
In the instant case, involving a proceeding based upon
section 571-11(1), as stated above, the State did not move to
reconsider the December 17, 2018 order dismissing with prejudice
the State's petition, and thus the family court did not hold a
hearing on reconsideration and also did not enter any findings of
fact and conclusions of law related to reconsideration as
required under HRS § 571-54.  Consequently, we lack appellate
jurisdiction in this case.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
case number CAAP-19-0000039 is dismissed for lack of appellate
jurisdiction.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, December 12, 2019.
