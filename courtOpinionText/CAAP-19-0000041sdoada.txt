Hearing Motion for Relief from Foreclosure Judgments (Order
Denying Relief), which was entered in the Circuit Court of the
First Circuit ( Circuit Court).1
Chun raises a single point of error on appeal,
contending that the Circuit Court erred when it denied Chun's

60(b)(4) motion, which asserted that Plaintiff-Appellee
Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, D/B/A Christiana Trust, not
individually but as Trustee for Carlsbad Funding Mortgage Trust
(Wilmington Savings), failed to establish its standing to
foreclose under Bank of America, N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 139
Hawai#i 361, 390 P.3d 1248 (2017), and which sought to set aside
the Circuit Court's Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law; Order
Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Default Judgment and Decree of
Foreclosure Against All Defendants on Complaint Filed June 27,
2012 (Foreclosure Decree), and Judgment, both filed May 5, 2017.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve Chun's point of error as follows:
The Circuit Court entered the Foreclosure Decree and
Judgment on May 5, 2017.  No timely appeal was filed from the
Foreclosure Decree and Judgment.  Chun's failure to appeal from
the Foreclosure Decree and Judgment bars Chun from now
challenging Wilmington Savings' standing under the doctrine of
res judicata.  See Mortg. Elec. Registration Sys., Inc. v. Wise,
130 Hawai#i 11, 17, 304 P.3d 1192, 1198 (2013).  
Lack of standing does not render a court's ruling void
under HRCP Rule 60(b)(4).  "In the sound interest of finality,
the concept of a void judgment must be narrowly restricted."
Cvitanovich-Dubie v. Dubie, 125 Hawai# i 128, 141, 254 P.3d 439,
452 (2011) (citations omitted).  It is well-recognized that "a
judgment is void only if the court that rendered it lacked
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
jurisdiction of either the subject matter or the parties or
otherwise acted in a manner inconsistent with due process of
law."  Id. at 139, 254 P.3d at 450 (citation omitted).  As the
Hawai#i Supreme Court recently reaffirmed, "[i]n Hawai# i state
courts, standing is a prudential consideration . . . and is not
an issue of subject matter jurisdiction."  Tax Found. of Hawai# i
v. State, 144 Hawai#i 175, 188, 439 P.3d 127, 140 (2019).  
Here, there is no challenge based on personal
jurisdiction, and an argument that a party lacks standing is not
equivalent to challenging a court's subject matter jurisdiction. 
Rather, this foreclosure action is "'in the class of suits' that
the [circuit] court 'has the general power to adjudicate.'" 
Cvitanovich-Dubie, 125 Hawai# i at 142, 254 P.3d at 453 (citation
omitted).  In sum, we conclude that the Circuit Court did not err
in entering the Order Denying Relief.
Therefore, the Circuit Court's January 2, 2019 Order
Denying Relief is affirmed.
