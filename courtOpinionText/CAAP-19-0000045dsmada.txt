APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 18-1-0010) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By:  Reifurth, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
appellate jurisdiction in appellate court case number CAAP-19-
0000045 over Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellant Noa K. 
Mau-Espirito's (Mau-Espirito) appeal from the Honorable Randall 
G.B. Valenciano's July 17, 2018 order granting Defendant/ 
Counterclaim-Plaintiff/Appellee Coco Palms Hui LLC's (Coco Palms 
Hui) motion for default judgment, and alternatively, summary 
judgment, against Mau-Espirito and Plaintiffs/Counterclaim-
Defendants/Appellees Charles D. Hepa (Hepa), Milton Ching 
(Ching), and Liko-O-Ka-Lani Martin (Martin) as to Coco Palms 
Hui's February 7, 2018 four-count counterclaim, because the 
circuit court has neither dismissed nor otherwise adjudicated  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
• Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellee Rupert
Rowe's (Rowe) claims in the January 17, 2018 four-count complaint against Coco Palms Hui, and 
• Coco Palms Hui's February 7, 2018 four-countcounterclaim as to Rowe and Plaintiffs/Counterclaim-Defendants/Appellees Adriane HealaniAkau, Cody Valpoon and Rangihekeiho Ruwhiu, 
which are still unresolved and pending before the circuit court 
in Civil No. 18-1-0010 (JRV). 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (2016) 
authorizes appeals to the Hawai# i Intermediate Court of Appeals 
from final judgments, orders, or decrees.  Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules 
of court."  HRS § 641-1(c).  Rule 58 of the Hawai
#i Rules of 
Civil Procedure (HRCP) requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document."  Based on this requirement 
under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai# i has held that 
"[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor 
of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to 
HRCP [Rule] 58[.]"  Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 
Hawai# i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994).  "Thus, based on 
Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been 
reduced to a separate judgment."  Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 
Hawai# i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008); Bailey v. 
Duvauchelle, 135 Hawai# i 482, 489, 353 P.3d 1024, 1031 (2015). 
The July 17, 2018 order is interlocutory, and the record shows 
that the circuit court is not yet ready to enter final judgment 
as to all claims in Civil No. 18-1-0010 (JRV) because the circuit 
court has not yet resolved all claims as to all parties. 
Although exceptions to the final judgment requirement 
exist under the doctrine in Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848) 
(the Forgay doctrine), the collateral order doctrine, and HRS 
§ 641-1(b) (2016), the July 17, 2018 order does not satisfy the 
requirements for those exceptions to apply.  See Ciesla v.

Reddish, 78 Hawai# i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) (regarding 
the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay 
doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 
Hawai# i 
319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding the three requirements for the collateral order doctrine); HRS § 641-1(b) 
(regarding the requirements for an appeal from an interlocutory 
order).  Absent an appealable final judgment, we lack appellate 
jurisdiction over appellate court case number CAAP-19-0000045. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court 
case number CAAP-19-0000045 is dismissed for lack of appellate 
jurisdiction.
