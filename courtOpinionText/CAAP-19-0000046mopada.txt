v. 
LPIHGC, LLC, Respondent-Counterclaimant-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1CSP-23-0000427) 
MEMORANDUM OPINION 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and Nakasone, JJ.) 
LPIHGC, LLC and Nordic PCL Construction, Inc. (formerly 
known as Nordic Construction, Ltd.) had a dispute about Nordic's 
performance of a Subcontract  for concrete work on a construction 
project. LPIHGC withheld payments under the subcontract. Nordic applied for a mechanic's lien. The project's Owner, Maui Beach NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Resort Limited Partnership, posted a Bond from Fidelity and 
Deposit Company of Maryland ( Surety), and the mechanic's lien 
case was dismissed. 
LPIHGC and Nordic arbitrated their disputes. An 
arbitrator made an award for LPIHGC against Nordic. The award 
was vacated, and rearbitration before a new arbitrator was ordered. 
During the second arbitration, Nordic sued LPIHGC, 
Owner, and Surety for a declaration that the Bond remained in force. The defendants moved to dismiss. The Circuit Court of the First Circuit denied the motion but certified its ruling for interlocutory appeal.
1 The Order Certifying Interlocutory Appeal 
was entered on January 9, 2019. LPIHGC, Owner, and Surety's appeal created CAAP-19-0000046. 
Meanwhile, a second arbitrator made an Interim Award 
and a Final Award . The Circuit Court of the First Circuit 
granted LPIHGC's motions to confirm the awards and denied Nordic's motions to vacate or modify the awards. The Final 
Judgment  was entered on December 1, 2023.
2 Nordic's appeal 
created CAAP-23-0000722. 
We consolidated the appeals because CAAP-19-0000046 
could become moot depending on how we decide CAAP-23-0000722. In CAAP-23-0000722, we affirm the December 1, 2023 Final Judgment entered in JIMS No. 1CSP-23-0000427. We dismiss CAAP-19-0000046 as moot. 
I. BACKGROUND 
These cases have a history going back seventeen years. 
Owner was building Honua Kai , a luxury condominium on Maui. See 
In re Nordic PCL Constr., Inc. v. LPIHGC, LLC
, 136 Hawai#i 29, 
358 P.3d 1 (2015) ( Nordic I ). 
Nordic did the concrete work. 
1 The Honorable Dean E. Ochiai presided. 
2 The Honorable John M. Tonaki presided. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
LPIHGC found Nordic's work unacceptable. As summarized by the 
second person to arbitrate the dispute: 
The nature of the dispute centers around Nordic's
performance of the finish quality for concrete form and flat
work to achieve a desired smooth, flat and level criterionfor the mat slab, elevated slabs, walls, columns, lanais,soffits and exterior formed surfaces. 
In the demand for arbitration, Nordic claims and
alleges that it properly performed all the work that it wasobligated to perform in accordance with its Subcontract andis therefore entitled to payment in full plus the payment ofa bonus. 
In its counterclaim, [LPIHGC] alleges that Nordic
breached the Subcontract by failing to fully perform andcomplete its contractual obligations to properly finish theconcrete surfaces, thereby resulting in [LPIHGC] incurringcosts to hire and pay third-party remedial contractors tofix and complete Nordic's contractual obligations. [LPIHGC]further asserts that it incurred other related expenses andcompensable delay in the completion of the Project caused byNordic's breach of the Subcontract. 
After LPIHGC made only partial payment under the 
Subcontract, Nordic applied for a mechanic's lien (the Mechanic's 
Lien Case ). Surety issued the Bond. Owner posted the Bond under 
Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 507-45. The Mechanic's Lien Case 
was dismissed on December 30, 2008. See Nordic Constr. Co. v. 
Maui Beach Resort Ltd. P'ship , No. 30151, 2010 WL 1434304, at *1 
(Haw. Apr. 8, 2010) (Order) ( Maui Beach I ). 
The Subcontract provided for arbitration of disputes. 
Nordic and LPIHGC arbitrated. During the arbitration, Owner 
moved to discharge the Bond in the Mechanic's Lien Case. A circuit court denied the motion without prejudice because the arbitration was pending. See Maui Beach I , 2010 WL 1434304, at 
*1. 
An award (the First Award ) was made on December 15, 
2010. 
Nordic I, 136 Hawai#i at 35, 358 P.3d at 7. LPIHGC was 
the prevailing party. Shortly after that, Owner again moved in the Mechanic's Lien Case to discharge the Bond. A circuit court granted the motion on May 16, 2011 ( Discharge Order ). 
See
 Nordic 
Constr., Ltd. v. Maui Beach Resort Ltd. P'ship , 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
No. CAAP-18-0000659, 2019 WL 1450166, at *1 (Haw. App. Apr. 1, 
2019) (Order) ( Maui Beach II ). 
LPIHGC petitioned to confirm the First Award. Nordic 
moved to vacate it. 
A circuit court confirmed the award and 
entered a judgment for LPIHGC. Nordic appealed. In Nordic I the supreme court vacated the judgment and directed the circuit court to hold an evidentiary hearing on Nordic's claim of the arbitrator's evident partiality. 136 Hawai #i at 54, 358 P.3d at 
26. 
On March 3, 2017, the circuit court entered findings of 
fact, conclusions of law, and an order. The court vacated the First Award and ordered a new arbitration before a new arbitrator. See In re Nordic PCL Constr., Inc. v. LPIHGC, LLC , 
___ Hawai #i ___, ___ P.3d ___, 2024 WL 4341412, at *1 (App. 2024) 
(Nordic II ), cert. granted, No. SCWC-23-0000757, 2025 WL 53242 
(Jan. 9, 2025). 
On November 14, 2017, Nordic moved for relief from the 
Discharge Order in the Mechanic's Lien Case. See
 Maui Beach II , 
2019 WL 1450166, at *1. On February 26, 2018, a circuit court granted the motion and vacated the Discharge Order ( Order 
Vacating Discharge ). Id. Owner appealed. We dismissed the 
appeal because the Order Vacating Discharge was a final post-judgment order and Owner's notice of appeal wasn't timely filed. Id. at *2. 
On May 4, 2018, Nordic sued LPIHGC, Surety, and Owner 
for a declaration that the Bond "is legally-binding, valid, and enforceable." LPIHGC, Surety, and Owner moved to dismiss. The circuit court treated the motion as one for summary judgment, held there were genuine issues of material fact because the Order Vacating Discharge was ambiguous, denied the motion, and certified its order for interlocutory appeal under HRS § 641-1(b). LPIHGC, Surety, and Owner filed a notice of appeal on January 17, 2019, creating CAAP-19-0000046. 
Meanwhile, Nordic and LPIHGC rearbitrated their claims. 
Nordic claimed it was entitled to $13,005,637 as full payment under the Subcontract, plus a bonus. LPIHGC counterclaimed for 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
$11,141,018 in damages caused by Nordic's breach of the 
Subcontract. The arbitrator made an Interim Award  on April 6, 
2023. The Interim Award addressed "all issues submitted to the Arbitrator in this matter except reasonable attorney fees and costs." The arbitrator concluded that Nordic materially breached the Subcontract; LPIHGC was not entitled to all of the damages it claimed and "is not entitled to withhold $2,700,007 from Nordic in labor costs budgeted but not expended by Nordic"; Nordic was not entitled to recover delay damages or an early completion bonus; and Nordic was liable for liquidated damages and premiums LPIHGC paid for the Bond. The Interim Award stated: 
18. [LPIHGC] is entitled to an award in the amount of
$7,197,223 under the Subcontract. The Subcontract amount 
not paid to Nordic was $7,434,467. Therefore, [LPIHGC]wrongfully withheld $237,244 from Nordic. 
. . . . 
A. [LPIHGC] is the prevailing party in this arbitration
having prevailed in its contested claim against [Nordic] inthe amount of $7,197,223 while [Nordic] is entitled torecover $237,244 that was wrongfully withheld by [LPIHGC]. 
B. As prevailing party, [LPIHGC] is entitled to an award
of reasonable attorney fees and costs to be reduced in the
amount of $237,244 (credited to [Nordic]). 
. . . . 
D. Jurisdiction is retained by the Arbitrator pursuant to
the January 11, 2023 Stipulation and Order, as modified, inorder to decide the remaining issue of reasonable attorneyfees and costs and issue a Final Award in this arbitration. 
The arbitrator made a Final Award  on May 30, 2023. 
LPIHGC's claim for fees and costs relating to the First Award was 
denied; its claim for fees and costs relating to the second arbitration was granted in part: 
D. The total Final Award to [LPIHGC] is $1,937,474
($2,174,718 in reasonable attorney fees and costs minus
$237,244 credit due to [Nordic] pursuant to the InterimAward). 
On June 26, 2023, LPIHGC petitioned the circuit court 
to confirm the Interim Award and Final Award. Nordic moved to 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
vacate or modify the awards. The circuit court entered an order 
confirming both awards and denying Nordic's motions to vacate or modify. A $1,937,474 judgment for LPIHGC against Nordic was entered on December 1, 2023. Nordic filed a notice of appeal on December 11, 2023, creating CAAP-23-0000722. We consolidated the appeals. 
II. POINTS OF ERROR 
In CAAP-23-0000722, Nordic contends the circuit court 
erred by: (1) failing to vacate the award of attorney fees and 
costs to LPIHGC; (2) failing to vacate the award of bond premiums 
as damages to LPIHGC; (3) failing to vacate or modify the award 
of damages that LPIHGC claimed for change order work it had recovered from Owner; and (4) failing to vacate the awards or 
remand to the arbitrator because the arbitrator refused to consider Nordic's rebuttal evidence. 
III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
We review the circuit court's ruling on an arbitration 
award de novo. 
Tatibouet v. Ellsworth, 99 Hawai#i 226, 233, 54 
P.3d 397, 404 (2002). 
"Judicial review of an arbitration award is confined to 
the strictest possible limits, and a court may only vacate an award on the grounds specified in HRS § 658A-23 and modify or correct on the grounds specified in HRS § 658A-24." In re 
Hawai#i State Teachers Association
, 140 Hawai#i 381, 391, 400 P.3d 
582, 592 (2017) (cleaned up). Courts "have no business weighing the merits of the award." Id. at 392, 400 P.3d at 593. Parties who arbitrate assume all hazards of the process, including the risk the arbitrator "may make mistakes in the application of law and in their findings of fact." 
Tatibouet , 99 Hawai#i at 233, 54 
P.3d at 404. 
The construction of, and legal effect given to, an 
arbitration agreement is a question of law reviewed de novo.

(2020). 
IV. DISCUSSION 
We first address Nordic's appeal from the December 1, 
2023 Judgment confirming the Interim Award and Final Award made 
in the second arbitration. 
A. The arbitrator did not exceed his powers by
awarding attorney fees to LPIHGC. 
HRS § 658A-23(a)(4) (2016) requires vacation of an 
arbitration award if "[a]n arbitrator exceeded the arbitrator's 
powers[.]" The supreme court has held that an arbitrator exceeds their powers "by deciding matters not submitted." Mathewson v. 
Aloha Airlines, Inc.
, 82 Hawai#i 57, 75, 919 P.2d 969, 987 (1996) 
(citing 
Brennan v. Stewarts' Pharmacies, Ltd. , 59 Hawai#i 207, 
223, 579 P.2d 673, 681-82 (1978)). See, e.g. , 
Koolau Radiology, 
Inc. v. Queen's Med. Ctr., 73 Haw. 433, 436, 447-48, 834 P.2d 1294, 1296, 1301-02 (1992) (arbitration agreement limited scope of arbitration to determining lease values and did not give arbitrator power to decide legal issues such as statute of frauds or parol evidence rule related to alleged oral agreement); Krafchow v. Dongbu Ins. Co.
, 152 Hawai#i 248, 258, 525 P.3d 697, 
707 (App. 2023) (appraiser and umpire exceeded their powers by deciding what amounts property insurer owed to insureds — which implicated coverage issues — rather than appraising value of what insureds lost because of a wildfire irrespective of insurance coverage); 
Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Reynolds , 77 Hawai#i 490, 
494, 889 P.2d 67, 71 (App. 1995) (holding, under arbitration clause of underinsured motorist policy, that arbitration on question of whether insured was "legally entitled to recover damages" is limited to determining tortfeasor's fault and amount of insured's damages, not whether underinsured motorist coverage applied under any particular circumstance). 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Subcontract's arbitration provision included this 
paragraph: 
(v) Powers of the Arbitrator. The arbitrator shall 
have the power to decide all Disputes submitted to
arbitration hereunder in accordance with these procedures.
The arbitrator shall not have the power to decide any
Dispute that was not submitted to arbitration by the
Parties. The Parties agree that in any arbitration
proceeding conducted under these procedures, the arbitrator
shall apply Hawaii law , shall follow the terms of this
Exhibit J [to the Subcontract], and shall only have the
power to provide in the award for any remedy that would have
been available to a court deciding the same matter , subject
to the limitations and remedies contained in these 
procedures. 
(Emphasis added.) 
Nordic argues the arbitrator exceeded his powers by 
awarding attorney fees to LPIHGC in the Final Award, because "[a] 
Hawai#i court could not have awarded 'prevailing party' attorneys 
fees to a defendant found liable for a net judgment to the 
plaintiff." Nordic's framing of the issue is too narrow. 
HRS § 607-14 (2016) provides, in relevant part: 
In all the courts, in all actions in the nature of
assumpsit and in all actions on a promissory note or other
contract in writing that provides for an attorney's fee,there shall be taxed as attorneys' fees, to be paid by thelosing party and to be included in the sum for whichexecution may issue, a fee that the court determines to bereasonable . . . . The court shall then tax attorneys'fees, which the court determines to be reasonable, to be
paid by the losing party . . . . 
. . . . 
The above fees provided for by this section shall be
assessed on the amount of the judgment exclusive of costs
and all attorneys' fees obtained by the plaintiff, and uponthe amount sued for if the defendant obtains judgment. 
Nordic and LPIHGC each claimed the other breached the 
Subcontract. Awarding attorney fees was a "remedy that would 
have been available to a court deciding the same matter[.]" Awarding attorney fees was thus within the arbitrator's power. 
The Interim Award stated: 
A. [LPIHGC] is the prevailing party in this arbitration
having prevailed in its contested claim against Nordic in 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the amount of $7,197,223[,] while [Nordic] is entitled to
recover $237,244 that was wrongfully withheld by [LPIHGC]. 
B. As prevailing party, [LPIHGC] is entitled to an award
of reasonable attorney fees and costs to be reduced in the
amount of $237,244 (credited to [Nordic]). 
The arbitrator concluding that LPIHGC was the 
prevailing party, if wrong, was one of the "hazards of the 
arbitration process including the risk that the arbitrators may make mistakes in the application of law[.]" Tatibouet, 99 Hawai#i at 233, 54 P.3d at 404. "A misinterpretation of law does 
not amount to exceeding enumerated powers[.]" Id. at 235, 54 P.3d at 406. The arbitrator did not exceed his powers by awarding attorney fees to LPIHGC, whom he concluded was the prevailing party. The circuit court did not err by denying Nordic's motion to vacate or modify under HRS § 658A-23(a)(4). 
B. The arbitrator did not exceed his powers by
awarding bond premiums to LPIHGC. 
LPIHGC claimed $442,313 for premiums paid for the Bond. 
The arbitrator found and concluded: 
153. On August 8, 2008, Nordic filed a lien claim against
the Owner to recover $8.5 million for its work to completethe Honua Kai project. To remove the cloud on title caused by the filing of Nordic's mechanic's lien action, the GC wasrequired by the Owner to post a bond for $17 million [asrequired by Haw. Rev. Stat §507-45 (1998) in twice theamount of Nordic's claim] in order to discharge Nordic'slien application on December 2, 2008. Premiums paid by theGC for the lien discharge bond amount to $442,312, asreflected in GC-303A-D. 
. . . . 
16. [LPIHGC] is entitled to reimbursement for the premiums
it paid to acquire lien bond discharge protection asrequired to discharge Nordic's lien claim in the amount of$442,312. 
A court may award costs to the prevailing party. 
Hawai#i Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 54(d)(1). Bond premiums 
are awardable costs. Dade v. Kuhta, 3 Haw. App. 89, 91, 641 P.2d 
989, 990 (1982) (affirming award of attachment bond fee to prevailing party). Nordic argues the arbitrator exceeded his 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
authority because "[a] court deciding the same matter could only 
have taxed these bond premiums as a litigation cost against Nordic if LPI[HGC] had been determined to be the 'prevailing party.'" (Emphasis omitted.) Whether right or wrong, the arbitrator concluded that LPIHGC was the prevailing party. The arbitrator did not exceed his powers by awarding bond premiums to LPIHGC. The circuit court did not err by declining to vacate the Final Award on that basis. 
C. Nordic did not show that the awards were 
procured by fraud or other undue means. 
HRS § 658A-23(a)(1) (2016) requires vacation of an 
arbitration award if "[t]he award was procured by corruption, 
fraud, or other undue means[.]" Nordic argues $476,011 of the damage award was procured by fraud because: 
LPI[HGC]'s lead counsel falsely stated to the Arbitrator in
closing arguments at least three times that there was noevidence in the record of any executed change order in favorof LPI[HGC] for the claimed amounts. . . . So, LPI[HGC] wasessentially "double dipping" by seeking recovery againstNordic for the same amounts. The Arbitrator nevertheless made findings in his Interim Award which awarded LPI[HGC]$476,011 in damages for amounts that Maui Beach had alreadypaid to LPI[HGC]. 
The arbitrator found: 
131. The costs incurred to remediate Nordic's Scope of Work
were verified by the remedial subcontractors and subsequenttrades who described the efforts required to remediateNordic's substandard work. 
. . . . 
139. Nordic failed to provide credible evidence that
remedial work was false, fraudulent, unnecessary orunreasonable. 
The Interim Award didn't itemize the damage award but 
Nordic claims, and LPIHGC doesn't dispute, that $476,011 of the 
cost of work performed under the change orders was awarded to LPIHGC. 
We apply a three-prong test to determine whether fraud 
is a basis for vacating an arbitration award: 
10 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
First, the movant must establish the fraud by clear and
convincing evidence. Second, the fraud must not have been
discoverable, upon the exercise of due diligence, prior to
or during arbitration. Third, the movant must demonstrate
that the fraud had a material effect on a dispositive issuein the arbitration. . . . 
. . . . 
This three-prong test sets a high standard in order to
deter motions that merely seek to relitigate issues that
were already — or could have been — presented to thearbitrator. The test therefore preserves the parties'bargain for the judgment of an arbitrator. At the same time, it offers relief for parties whose bargain does not
extend to a determination procured by fraud. 
Low v. Minichino, 126 Hawai#i 99, 107, 108, 267 P.3d 683, 691, 
692 (App. 2011) (emphasis added) (citation omitted).
(1) Nordic did not show by clear and convincing 
evidence that LPIHGC's counsel intended to defraud the 
arbitrator. 
LPIHGC's counsel submitted a declaration opposing 
Nordic's motion to vacate stating: "I did misspeak in my closing remarks when I said that there was no evidence that the Project Owner and the GC had executed a change order covering the $476,011 in remedial costs. . . . While I was mistaken in my closing remarks, the mistake was not willful or intentional." His declaration also explained his mistake. 
In Low we held that "perjury may constitute a basis for 
vacating an arbitration award." 126 Hawai#i at 108, 267 P.3d at 
692. But "it is axiomatic that the arguments of counsel are not evidence." State v. Quitog, 85 Hawai #i 128, 144, 938 P.2d 559, 
575 (1997) (cleaned up). The circuit court's order stated: "If every misstatement by counsel during closing argument was interpreted as a fraud on the court, almost every jury trial would end up in a new trial. More has to be shown than simply a misstatement or false statement about the evidence." We agree. Nordic did not satisfy the first prong.
(2) Even if LPIHGC's counsel had intended to defraud 
the arbitrator, he didn't get away with it. 
Nordic caught it 
during closing argument. By Nordic's own description: 
11 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
During closing argument and briefs, Nordic pointed out that
the parties' joint-exhibits contained change orders showingthat [Owner] had already paid LPI[HGC] for the amounts itwas seeking against Nordic. 
Nordic did not satisfy the second prong.
(3) Nordic had to demonstrate that fraud had a 
material effect on a dispositive issue in the arbitration. After 
LPIHGC argued there was no evidence Owner paid LPIHGC for doing remedial work, Nordic directed the arbitrator to specific executed change orders showing Owner paid LPIHGC for that work. What the arbitrator did with this information no one knows. But the arbitrator erroneously including the change order amounts in LPIHGC's damage award was an arbitration risk Nordic assumed. Tatibouet, 99 Hawai #i at 233, 54 P.3d at 404. Nordic did not 
satisfy the third prong and has not shown that the Interim Award was procured by fraud. 
The circuit court did not err by denying 
Nordic's motion to vacate or modify under HRS § 658A-23(a)(1). 
D. The arbitrator did not refuse to consider 
evidence material to the controversy toNordic's prejudice. 
HRS § 658A-23(a)(3) (2016) requires vacation of an 
arbitration award if the arbitrator "refused to consider evidence 
material to the controversy[.]" Evidence is material to the controversy "when it has a tendency to make the existence of any fact that was of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence." Tatibouet , 99 Hawai #i at 243, 54 P.3d at 414 (cleaned 
up) (quoting Mathewson , 82 Hawai #i at 78, 919 P.2d at 990); 
Hawaii Rules of Evidence ( HRE
) Rule 401 (defining "relevant 
evidence"). In Tatibouet  and 
Mathewson  the supreme court 
reviewed the arbitrator's formulation of the issues and the admitted evidence to determine whether the excluded evidence would have been relevant under HRE Rule 401. We do so here. 
According to the arbitrator: "[LPIHGC] alleges that 
Nordic breached the Subcontract by failing to . . . properly 
12 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
finish the concrete surfaces, thereby resulting in [LPIHGC] 
incurring costs to . . . fix and complete Nordic's contractual obligations." The evidence showed that Nordic agreed to provide "concrete floor finishing to specified tolerances[.]" LPIHGC agreed that flatness and levelness tolerances had to be met when the "floors are shored, but not necessarily when [the] shores are struck." 
Steve Baldridge  was the structural engineer for Honua 
Kai. Nordic's structural engineering expert John Osteraas  took 
Baldridge's design for areas where tile flooring was specified and calculated that 40-73% of those areas would need leveling even if Nordic had poured and finished them perfectly flat and level before the shores were struck. Thus, Nordic argued, LPIHGC did not account for post-shore-removal deflection-related surface preparation when it priced its general contract and — by implication — tried to recover its loss from Nordic. 
LPIHGC called Baldridge as its witness. He claimed his 
post-tensioned concrete slab designs never needed leveling due to deflection: 
Q. Okay. And what you're saying is that whatever
the design deflection was, you believe that that was
adequate to eliminate the need for any self-leveling orleveling due to deflection? 
A. At the level of deflections you design to, you
wouldn't need self-leveling. 
Q. At all? 
A. At all. 
Q. Ever? 
A. Ever. 
Q. Okay. And is it your belief that for all of the
post-tensioned buildings that you've designed in Hawaii,that no -- no slab leveling due to deflection was everrequired? 
A. Not due to deflection. I'm sure there's been 
leveling on slabs that we've been involved with . 
(Emphasis added.) 
13 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Baldridge also testified he was not aware if the 
general contractors on his other Honolulu projects — K ō#ula, 
A
#ali#i
, Ae#o, and Victoria Place — budgeted for slab leveling to 
address post-tensioned slab deflection. In rebuttal, Nordic 
called Igor Mokan. LPIHGC objected. This exchange occurred: 
[ARBITRATOR]: Could you tell me what you're going to
be asking him? 
[NORDIC'S COUNSEL]: Yes. I'm going to ask him his
name. 
I'm going to ask him who he works for, and it's BMK.
I'm going to ask what business BMK is in; and he's going to
say installing flooring, finishes, and whatnot. 
I'm going to ask: Did BMK install any floor finishes
at Koula? And he's going to say yeah. And I said: Was there any slab leveling done at Koula? He's going to sayyeah. I said: Was there a slabbing allowance -- slableveling? Yes. 
I mean, were you involved in it? Yes. And was the 
work done? Yes. And just describe briefly what was done 
and what's the status of the amount . 
And then I'm going to ask the same issue at Aeo,
basically the same answer, same issue at Aalii. 
These are three projects that Mr. Baldridge says that,
you know, these were among all these buildings that never 
had any slab leveling issues . 
And that's it. 
That's all I got for him. And I --
I'm not calling him as an expert. I'm calling him as a factwitness just to contradict what -- these arguments that they
made through Baldridge  that weren't in Baldridge's report,
weren't in his declaration, and are being used to falsely
represent that on all his prior projects, there were no slab
leveling, which is not true . 
[ARBITRATOR]: Isn't the major issue on impeachment ,
as Mr. Baldridge testified, that there was no slab allowance 
for these --
[NORDIC'S COUNSEL]: Yeah, there's no -- because there 
would be no need for slab leveling  on any of these things
and his knowledge --
[ARBITRATOR]: Okay. I'm going to limit the testimony
to whether or not there is a slab allowance, not whathappened . 
(Emphasis added.) 
Baldridge did not testify there was no slab leveling on 
any of his projects. He said there was no slab leveling "due to 
14 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
deflection." He also said, "I'm sure there's been leveling on 
slabs that we've been involved with." And Baldridge's claim that slab leveling due to deflection would not be needed was already contradicted by Osteraas's opinion that 40-73% of the areas where tile flooring was specified would need leveling even if Nordic had poured and finished them to be perfectly flat and level before the shores were struck. 
Nordic's opening brief describes a declaration signed 
by Mokan as "submitted with Nordic's proffer to call Mr. Mokan as a rebuttal witness during the arbitration hearing." Mokan's declaration is dated June 27, 2023, after the April 6, 2023 Interim Award was made. The arbitrator could not have considered Mokan's declaration as an offer of proof. 
Even if Mokan's declaration had been before the 
arbitrator, it would not have been material to whether Nordic's work met flatness and levelness tolerances when the floors were shored. 
Mokan's company, BMK, was the flooring subcontractor for 
Kō#ula, A#ali#i, and Ae #o. Mokan stated: 
8. For each of these three projects, the contractor
"shot" floor elevation laser surveys before and after the 
forms and shores were removed  to confirm or otherwise 
address the concrete contractor's compliance with the
concrete surface tolerances for flatness and levelness applicable to its work. This took place several monthsbefore BMK did any of its work. 
(Emphasis added.) 
Nordic cites no evidence from the arbitration showing 
that flatness or levelness was measured before the shoring was 
removed to document Nordic's compliance with those tolerances. The arbitrator found: 
107. [Nordic]'s December 4, 2006 proposal provided
that Nordic would remediate areas that failed to meet the 
3/8" gap under a 10' straightedge test based on measurementstaken after the support shores were removed. It was on this basis that remedial work was performed at the GC's directionand then back charged to Nordic after Nordic failed toperform. 
15 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Nordic cites no evidence showing how much time passed 
between removal of the shores and performance of the straightedge 
tests. 
Mokan's declaration also stated: 
5. On each of these projects, part of BMK's scope
of work was to prepare the floor slabs to receive the
specified floor finishes by performing selective grinding ofhigh spots and applying a "self leveling" material to lowspots on the floor slabs to achieve a floor surface profilethat would satisfy the floor surface tolerances for flatnessand levelness required for the installation of the specifiedfloor finishes. This work is generally referred to as "slableveling." 
The arbitrator found: 
113. There was no gap in Division 9 that prevented
Nordic from performing its obligations under the Division 3specifications (03350). The Division 9 levelness criteria applied to Global Stone and had nothing to do with Nordic'sfailure to perform under Division 3. Global Stone itself had expressly subcontracted and assumed all responsibilityto take all steps within its contract to receive floorsdelivered by the concrete finisher at the 3/8" standard andachieve compliance for any further efforts required toinstall finish materials under Division 9. There was no evidence that Global Stone charged for remedial work thatdid not fail the 3/8" gap under a 10' straightedge remedialstandard agreed to by Nordic. 
The work BMK performed on K ō#ula, A#ali #i, and Ae #o was 
akin to Global Stone's work on Honua Kai. The arbitrator did not 
hold Nordic responsible for the cost of Global Stone's work to 
further level portions of the slabs that complied with the 3/8" in 10-foot tolerance. 
On this record, we cannot conclude the 
arbitrator "refused to consider evidence material to the controversy[.]" The circuit court did not err by denying Nordic's motion to vacate or modify under HRS § 658A-23(a)(3). 
E. CAAP-19-0000046 is moot. 
In Hawai#i, "mootness is an issue of justiciability[.]" 
State v. Hewitt, 153 Hawai #i 33, 42, 526 P.3d 558, 567 (2023). 
It is properly invoked when "events subsequent to the judgment of the trial court have so affected the relations between the parties that the two conditions for justiciability relevant on 
16 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appeal — adverse interest and effective remedy — have been 
compromised." Lathrop v. Sakatani , 111 Hawai #i 307, 313, 141 
P.3d 480, 486 (2006). 
Surety issued the Bond to secure a potential judgment 
for Nordic against LPIHGC. See HRS § 507-45. The Interim Award 
and Final Award were for LPIHGC and against Nordic. We are affirming the circuit court's Final Judgment. There being no debt for the Bond to secure, the dispute about its continuing enforceability is moot. None of the exceptions to the mootness doctrine — "capable of repetition, yet evading review"; "public interest"; and "collateral consequences" — apply. See Hamilton 
ex rel. Lethem v. Lethem, 119 Hawai #i 1, 5, 193 P.3d 839, 843 
(2008). 
CAAP-19-0000046 is moot and will be dismissed. 
VII. CONCLUSION 
The December 1, 2023 Final Judgment entered in JIMS 
No. 1CSP-23-0000427 is affirmed. 
CAAP-19-0000046 is dismissed as 
moot.
