SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant L&E Ranch LLC (L&E Ranch) appeals 
from the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit's:1 (1) November 2, 
2018 Order Granting Motion for Order Approving Report of 
Commissioner, Confirming Sale of Real Property at Public Auction, Directing Distribution of Proceeds, and for Issuance of 
a Writ of Possession Filed on August 2, 2018 (Order Confirming 
Sale); (2) November 23, 2018 Judgment on Order Confirming Sale 
(Judgment); and (3) February 5, 2019 denial of L&E Ranch's 
Nonhearing Motion for Rehearing/Reconsideration. 
L&E Ranch raises two points of error, contending the 
circuit court abused its discretion when it confirmed the foreclosure auction sale of two of its real properties 
(together, Ranch Property) to Plaintiff-Appellee Romspen 
Investment Corporation (Romspen) because: (1) the bid price 
from Romspen was so low that it shocks the conscience; and 
(2) the circuit court did not hold an evidentiary hearing to 
determine the fair market value of the Ranch Property.  
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
1 The Honorable Rhonda I.L. Loo presided. 
2   
 
 
 
  
   
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve the 
points of error2 as discussed below, and affirm. 
(1) L&E Ranch contends the bid price of $15,300,000.00 
shocks the conscience because the Ranch Property was appraised 
at $34 million in 2014 and $48 million in 2017, and it says it 
received purchase offers for $22 million, $31 million, and 
$32 million for the Ranch Property from other parties. 
A mortgagee is not required to obtain fair market 
value when foreclosing on real property. 
See Hungate v. Law
Off. of David B. Rosen, 139 Hawaiʻ i 394, 408-09, 391 P.3d 1, 15-
16 (2017) (discussing nonjudicial foreclosures and recognizing that foreclosure sales commonly fail to produce fair market 
value bids), abrogated on other grounds by State ex rel. Shikada 
v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., 152 
Hawaiʻi 418, 446, 526 P.3d 395, 
423 (2023); see also Wodehouse v. Hawaiian Tr. Co., 32 Haw. 835, 
852 (Haw. Terr. 1933) (stating that courts may refuse to confirm 
a foreclosure bid that is "grossly inadequate") (emphasis 
added). 
During a related federal bankruptcy proceeding, the 
Bankruptcy Court reviewed the offers (including the $31 million 
offer) L&E Ranch received prior to the hearing on the motion to 
confirm sale and noted "none of these offers is a firm, binding 
2 We do not address arguments not raised as a point of error. See 
Hawaiʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(4).

commitment." In lifting a stay of the foreclosure proceedings 
in this case, the Bankruptcy Court ordered that the sale 
confirmation hearing could not be held prior to September 4, 
2018, noting if L&E Ranch "can't bring one of these transactions 
together in that period of time, then it's not going to happen." 
L&E Ranch does not assert it had a buyer at the time of the sale 
confirmation hearing held September 6, 2018. 
Moreover, there was other evidence of the Ranch 
Property's value. The Commissioner's Report stated "public records indicate that the 'market value' for Parcel First is 
$8,538[,]900.00, the 'agricultural land value' for Parcel First 
is $87,100.00 and the tax assessed value (2018) for Parcel First 
is $87,100.00." The Commissioner's Report also stated "public 
records indicate that the 'market value' for Parcel Second is 
$6,723,300.00, the 'agricultural land value' for Parcel Second 
is $150,200.00 and the tax assessed value (2018) for Parcel [Second] is $150,200.00" In sum, according to the 
Commissioner's Report, the market value for the Ranch Property 
totaled $15,262,200.00. No objections to the Commissioner's 
Report were filed, and the circuit court "ratified, approved and 
confirmed" the Commissioner's Report. 
When considering L&E Ranch's inability to find a buyer 
(even at $22 million) and public records indicating the 2018 
4   
 
 
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"market value" was $15,262,200.00, we cannot say that the 
$15,300,000.00 sales price shocks the conscience. The circuit 
court therefore did not abuse its discretion when confirming the 
foreclosure sale. 
(2) L&E Ranch contends the circuit court abused its 
discretion "by refusing to hold an evidentiary hearing to 
determine the true value of the subject property, allowing 
Romspen to foreclose on additional collateral[.]" 
In HawaiiUSA Federal Credit Union v. Monalim, the 
Hawai‘i Supreme Court adopted a new rule that a deficiency 
judgment debtor may request a hearing to determine the fair 
market value of the foreclosed property as of the date of the 
foreclosure sale. 147 Hawai‘i 33, 36, 47-49, 464 P.3d 821, 824, 
835-37 (2020). The deficiency judgment is to be determined by 
subtracting the greater of the fair market value or confirmed bid price of the property from amounts owed by the debtor. Id.
at 46-49, 464 P.3d at 834-37. This new rule, however, applied 
prospectively and "applie[d] only to foreclosure cases in which 
a deficiency judgment is first entered after the date of this 
opinion." Id. at 54, 464 P.3d at 842. 
As L&E Ranch recognized in its opening brief, 
Hawai‘i 
precedent when the circuit court confirmed the sale did not require a fair market value determination hearing and, thus, we

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
conclude the circuit court did not disregard rules or principles 
of law by omitting one here. Notwithstanding Romspen's argument 
to the contrary, the circuit court's Order Confirming Sale did 
not establish a deficiency judgment or determine a "formula" for 
determining a deficiency amount.3 
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the circuit court's 
(1) November 2, 2018 Order Confirming Sale; (2) November 23, 
2018 Judgment; and (3) February 5, 2019 denial of L&E Ranch's 
motion for reconsideration. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai‘i, April 24, 2024.

for Plaintiff-Appellee. 
3 We reject Romspen's argument that the circuit court's July 25, 2017 
order precludes a fair value hearing in conjunction with a determination of a 
deficiency judgment.
