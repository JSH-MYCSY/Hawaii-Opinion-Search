IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
WILLIAM M. GILROY, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CR. NO. 3CPC-18-0000893) 
ORDER 
DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
AND 
DISMISSING AS MOOT THE JANUARY 22, 2019 AFFIDAVIT
IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO PROCEED IN FORMA PAUPERIS 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record for appellate court case 
number CAAP-19-0000049 and criminal court case number 3CPC-18-
0000893, it appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction over 
Defendant-Appellant William M. Gilroy's appeal from the Honorable 
Melvin Fujino's January 17, 2019 bench warrant under Hawaii 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-11 (2016) in the absence of either 
an appealable final judgment of conviction or a final order of 
dismissal. 
"The right of appeal in a criminal case is purely 
statutory[.]" State v. Nicol, 140 Hawai# i 482, 485, 403 P.3d 
259, 262 (2017) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The law that allows appeals from circuit court criminal cases is NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRS § 641-11, which provides that "[a]ny party aggrieved by the 
judgment of a circuit court in a criminal matter may appeal to 
the intermediate appellate court, subject to chapter 602, in the 
manner and within the time provided by the rules of court. The 
sentence of the court in a criminal case shall be the judgment." 
Thus, "[u]nder HRS § 641-11, the sentence of the court in a 
criminal case is the judgment from which an appeal is 
authorized[,]" and where "[t]here [is] no conviction and sentence 
in . . . [a] case, there can be no appeal under HRS § 641-11[.]" 
State v. Kealaiki, 95 Hawai# i 309, 312, 22 P.3d 588, 591 (2001) 
(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). 
In determining 
whether an order or judgment qualifies for appealability under 
HRS § 641-11, the Supreme Court of Hawai# i has "focused the 
inquiry on whether the relevant order terminated the proceedings in the case and left nothing further to be accomplished by the 
lower court." Nicol, 140 Hawai# i at 492, 403 P.3d at 269. 
Consequently, in addition to authorizing an appeal from a judgment, "HRS § 641-11 authorizes a defendant's appeal in a 
criminal matter from a circuit court order dismissing the 
proceedings without prejudice." Id. at 494, 403 P.3d at 271 
(footnote omitted). 
In the instant case, the circuit court has neither 
dismissed nor entered judgment on Plaintiff-Appellee State of 
Hawai# i's January 16, 2019 amended complaint asserting twenty-
nine counts of unauthorized practice of law in violation of HRS § 605-14 (2016), HRS § 605-15 (2016), HRS § 605-17 (2016), and 
HRS § 702-204 (2016). 
In the absence of an appealable final 
judgment or final order that terminates the proceedings in criminal case number 3CPC-18-0000893, leaving nothing further to 
be accomplished, the January 17, 2019 bench warrant is not yet

eligible for appellate review. Gilroy's appeal from the ongoing 
proceedings is premature, and we lack appellate jurisdiction. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED appellate court case 
number CAAP-19-0000049 is dismissed for lack of appellate 
jurisdiction. 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that Gilroy's January 22, 
2019 affidavit in support of motion for leave to proceed on 
appeal in forma pauperis is dismissed as moot.
