APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 5CPC-17-0000062) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL 
(By:  Reifurth, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that: 
(1) On January 23, 2019, Defendant-Appellant Lance 
Kamuela Gomes (Gomes), pro se, filed the notice of appeal and statement of jurisdiction; 
(2) On March 25, 2019, the circuit court clerk filed 
the record on appeal, and the appellate clerk notified the 
parties that the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief were 
due on or before April 4, 2019, and May 6, 2019, respectively, 
despite Gomes having filed the statement of jurisdiction with the 
notice of appeal; 
(3) Gomes did not file the opening brief or request an 
extension of time; 
(4)
 On May 31, 2019, the appellate clerk notified Gomes 
that the time for filing the statement of jurisdiction and 
opening brief had expired, the matter would be called to the 
court's attention on June 10, 2019, for appropriate action, which 
could include dismissal of the appeal, under Hawai# i Rules of NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rules 12.1(e) and 30, and Gomes may 
request relief from default by motion; and 
(5) The default notice erroneously stated Gomes failed 
to file the statement of jurisdiction but he took no further 
action in this appeal with respect to the opening brief. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed for failure to file the opening brief, under HRAP 
Rule 30.
