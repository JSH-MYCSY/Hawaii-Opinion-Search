Adelkoff raises four points of error on appeal, 
contending that the Circuit Court erred by affirming (the affirmation of) the approval by Defendant-Appellee the Planning Director of the Planning Department of the County of Hawai# i 
(
Director) of the subdivision application (Subdivision Approval) 
of Appellees-Appellees Douglas W. Dick, as Trustee of the Revocable Trust of Douglas W. Dick, and Ruth S. Dick, as Trustee of the Revocable Trust of Ruth S. Dick (the Dicks), and a related 
Revised Final Plat Map (RFPM) because: (1) the RFPM did not comply with the mandatory drainage and flooding mitigation 
provisions of the County of Hawai# i subdivision code, and even if 
the code provisions were discretionary, the Director made no written waiver and acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner; (2) even if the subdivision code provisions were discretionary, not mandatory, the County of Hawai# i Planning Department 
(Planning Department) failed to investigate the flooding 
conditions on Adelkoff's abutting property prior to the 
Subdivision Approval, which was arbitrary and capricious; (3) the RFPM incorrectly shows direct vehicular access from Mâ malahoa 
Highway onto subdivided Lot D-1 across Adelkoff's driveway in violation of Ordinance No. 13-102 and the subdivision code; and 
3 In the FOFs/COLs/Order and Judgment, the Circuit Court affirmed
the May 29, 2018 Finding of Fact, Conclusion of Law and Decision and Order
entered by the Hawai #i County Board of Appeals ( Board of Appeals ) that
conducted a contested case on a petition filed by Adelkoff appealing the May2, 2017 issuance of final subdivision approval for a two-lot subdivision ofreal property in Waimea, 
Hawai #i.

(4) the Planning Department improperly delegated its 
investigation into Adelkoff's flooding concerns. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve Adelkoff's points of error as follows: 
(1 & 2) Adelkoff argues that before a property owner 
can obtain approval of a requested subdivision, the Director must comply with, inter alia, 
Hawai#i County Code (HCC) §§ 23-64 
(2016), 23-66 (2016), 23-92 (2016),  and the Director failed to 4

(2) When required by the director, contours atvertical intervals of five feet where the slopeis greater than ten percent. Elevations shall be marked on the contours based on an established bench mark or other datum approvedby the director of public works. In addition,the contours as may be required by the manager,State department of health, and director ofpublic works shall be shown;

The amount of expected runoff shall be calculated according to theDepartment of Public Works "Storm Drainage Standards",dated October 1970, or any approved revisions thereto,or by any nationally-recognized method meeting withthe approval of the director of public works.

not have authority to ignore the mandatory requirements of the 
HCC and did not have discretion to approve the Dicks' subdivision application without strict compliance with the requirements. 
In Leslie, the supreme court held that HCC §§ 23-63 
(1975), 23-64 (1975), 23-65 (1975), and 23-66 (1975) were mandatory and not discretionary because they contained the term "shall." 109 Hawai# i at 393-94, 126 P.3d at 1080-81. As a 
result, the Director "lacked discretion to accept a subdivision application without strict compliance with the code requirements." Id. at 394, 126 P.3d at 1081 (internal quotation 
marks omitted). The supreme court applied a three-prong test used when determining whether "shall" can be interpreted as directory, and concluded that it was not met, under the circumstances of that case, nor in the context of the 1975 versions of HCC §§ 23-63, 23-64, 23-65, and 23-66. Leslie, 109 
Hawai#i at 394-95, 126 P.3d at 1081-82. 
However, the HCC was amended in 2006 shortly after 
Leslie was decided. In relevant part, HCC §§ 23-62 through 23-78 were amended in 2006 by Ordinance No. 06-104 (Bill No. 246) (approved July 3, 2006). The amendments arose as a result of Leslie because the case "invalidate[d] [the] practices that the [Department] ha[d] followed for at least thirty years, and force[d] the County to adopt changes in the subdivision code, or risk invalidating hundreds of past and pending subdivision applications." Id. at 1. 
The County of Hawai#i noted that 
Leslie created an 
issue because there were "several hundred" pending subdivision 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
applications that did not conform to the "strict letter of the 
Code in all respects." Id. at 2. "Most of the tentative and 
final subdivision approvals given by the [Department] for several decades are based upon applications that have some defects according to [Leslie]." Id.As a result, the County amended 
Chapter 23 to, in part, "eliminate some requirements and standards that have not generally been followed." Id.Part of 
these amendments included the addition of the language "unless waived or deferred by the director", to HCC §§ 23-64 and 23-66. Id.
 at 6-7. In amending its subdivision code, Hawai#i County 
conferred discretion to the Director to determine whether to strictly enforce the provisions of HCC §§ 23-64 and 23-66, rejecting the mandatory interpretation set forth in 
Leslie. 
Thus, Adelkoff's argument based on Leslie is without merit. 
Adelkoff further argues that even if compliance with 
these sections was not mandatory, it was an abuse of discretion for the Director to issue the Subdivision Approval without the specified drainage and flooding mitigation information. Adelkoff asserts that the Preliminary Plat Map did not include "[t]he location and direction of all water courses and approximate location of areas subject to inundation or storm water overflow" in violation of HCC § 23-64(3); the Dicks did not submit a drainage map depicting the "approximate location of areas subject to inundation or storm water overflow and all areas covered by waterways, including ditches, gullies, streams and drainage courses within or abutting the subdivision, including [Lot C];" nor did the Director require provisions for "conceptual drainage" 
6  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
or "flood control" for the proposed subdivision, allegedly in 
violation of HCC § 23-66(4). Finally, Adelkoff claims that the 
record does not reflect that the Director formally waived the 
requirements of HCC §§ 23-64(3) or 23-66(4). 
However, Adelkoff did not challenge any specific FOFs 
in making these arguments here or in the Circuit Court. Unchallenged FOFs are binding on appeal. See, e.g., Pila# a
 400, 
LLC v. Bd. of Land and Nat. Res.
, 132 Hawai#i 247, 268, 320 P.3d 
912, 933 (2014). The Circuit Court found that Adelkoff's exhibits presented at the March 8, 2018 hearing demonstrated that the water "flooding" Adelkoff's property flowed from east to west, not from the north (i.e., not from the Dicks' Lot). In mixed findings and conclusions, the Circuit Court concluded that HCC § 23-64(3) did not apply to the Subdivision Application because there were no watercourses or areas "subject to inundation or storm water overflow" on Lot D (the Dicks' Lot). The Circuit Court similarly concluded that HCC § 23-66 also did not apply because there were no areas of inundation on Lot D and the Dicks did not propose, nor did the Director require, drainage improvements. The Circuit Court's numerous, detailed, and unchallenged FOFs concerning the flooding and drainage issues raised by Adelkoff are supported by substantial evidence adduced at the contested case hearing before the Board of Appeals and are not clearly erroneous. We further conclude that the Circuit Court did not err in concluding that the Director did not abuse his discretion in issuing the Subdivision Approval based on the 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
alleged flooding and drainage issues, and the Circuit Court did 
not err in denying Adelkoff's appeal on those grounds. 
Adelkoff also argues that the Subdivision Approval 
violated HCC § 23-92(a) and (b) because the Director failed to require, and the Dicks failed to prepare, water disposal systems and calculations, and the Director could not have waived or deferred the above-stated HCC provisions because they are mandatory conditions. The Circuit Court found and concluded, inter alia, that the Dicks were not required to provide runoff calculations because they did not propose improvements, nor were improvements required (except for a separate meter), Lot D did not have drainage issues, and "there was no storm water to dispose of in this subdivision." Upon review, the Circuit Court's findings (and the Board of Appeals' findings) were supported by substantial evidence in the record and were not clearly erroneous. 
For these reasons, we conclude that no relief is 
warranted based on Adelkoff's first two points of error. 
(3) Adelkoff argues that the Director did not have the 
authority to issue the Subdivision Approval because the RFPM failed to comply with two restrictions, Condition F of Ordinance No. 13-102 (Condition F) and HCC §§ 23-34 and 23-53 (2016). 
It is undisputed that Condition F limited "direct" 
vehicular access to Mâmalahoa Highway from Lot D (and later Lots D-1 and D-2) to the # ohana driveway. In other words, the Dicks 
could not construct (for example) additional driveway access to the highway from their property. However, as stated in the 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Circuit Court's FOFs, which are supported by substantial evidence 
in the record, Condition F did not prohibit the Dicks from the continued use of the Easement over Adelkoff's property. The Circuit Court found that the Easement, which ran along the "side" (or flag pole) of both Lots D-1 and D-2, was considered indirect access between Lots D-1 and D-2 and Mâmalahoa Highway.  Adelkoff fails to point to evidence in the record or legal authority for her contention that the subdivision of Lot D extinguishes the Easement. We conclude that the Circuit Court did not err in concluding that the Subdivision Approval did not violate Condition F. 
Adelkoff also argues that the Subdivision Approval 
violates HCC § 23-34 (2016) and 23-53, which provide: 
Section 23-34. Access to lot from street. 
Each subdivided lot shall abut upon a public street or
approved private street. No lot shall be platted without
access on a street. The director may indicate the side orsides of any lot from which driveway access shall bepermitted or prohibited. 
Section 23-53. Private streets. 
No private street or alley shall be approved unless
they are improved as specified under article 6, division 2
of this chapter. 
Here, the Circuit Court found, inter alia, that both 
Lots D-1 and D-2 had existing access to a street (Mâmalahoa 
Highway) over the Easement, which is not a street. The Circuit Court's FOFs relevant to this point of error are well supported by substantial evidence in the record and not clearly erroneous. We conclude that Adelkoff's arguments are without merit. 
(4) Adelkoff argues that the Planning Department 
unlawfully delegated its responsibilities to the Dicks' representative, Sidney Fuke (Fuke), to review and investigate the 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Subdivision Application rather than doing its own review and 
investigation in violation of the HCC and Kahana Sunset Owners Ass'n v. Cty. of Maui, 86 Hawai# i 66, 75, 947 P.2d 378, 387 
(1997). 
Adelkoff points to two pages of email communications in 
the record between Fuke and the Planning Department, starting with Fuke's inquiring if the department could move forward, in part due to Douglas Dick's battle with cancer and desire to "tidy up his estate." The email communications end with the Planning Department correspondent telling Fuke who will be "working on this." As stated in the FOFs/COLs/Order, Adelkoff failed to demonstrate that the Director improperly delegated decision-making authority or investigative or any other duties to the Dicks' representative. Adelkoff has not challenged COL 88, which states: "Both [Department of Public Works] and the Planning Department independently investigated and reviewed relevant information presented by [Adelkoff] as well as the Dicks and their representative." We conclude that this point of error is without merit. 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's January 18, 2019 
Judgment is affirmed.
