(CASE NO. 1FFC-17-0001283)  
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, and Wadsworth and Nakasone, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Matua T. Tuaolo, also known as 
Matua Tuaolo (T
uaolo), appeals from the Judgment of Conviction 
and Probation Sentence (Judgment) entered on December 27, 2018, 
by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court).   1

or Household Members under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 709-906(1) and (9) (2014) (Counts 1 and 2)  and two counts of Assault

1 The Honorable Todd W. Eddins presided.

(1) It shall be unlawful for any person, singly or in

in the Third Degree under HRS § 707-712(1)(a) (2014) (Counts 3 
and 4).3 Tuaolo was found not guilty on Counts 1 and 2. This 
appeal involves Tuaolo's convictions on Counts 3 and 4. His wife 
Isabella Tuaolo's (Isabella's) minor children NG and MK 
(collectively, Children) were the complainants on Counts 3 and 4, 
respectively.4 
Tuaolo raises two points of error on appeal, contending 
that: (1) the Circuit Court's "standard" jury instructions 1.1, 
1.2, 1.4, 1.7, and 2.2 were prejudicially insufficient, 
erroneous, and misleading and denied Tuaolo his constitutional 
right to due process and a fair trial; and (2) the Circuit 
Court's instructions to the jury were prejudicially insufficient, 
erroneous, and misleading where it failed to instruct the jury on 
self-defense as to Counts 3 and 4. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we 
resolve Tuaolo's points of error as follows: 
The standard applicable to our review of jury 
instructions is well established. 
When jury instructions or the omission thereof are at
issue on appeal, the standard of review is whether, when
read and considered as a whole, the instructions given areprejudicially insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent, ormisleading. 
(9) Where the physical abuse occurs in the
presence of any family or household member who is lessthan fourteen years of age, abuse of a family orhousehold member is a class C felony. 
3 HRS § 707-712 provides, in pertinent part: 
Assault in the third degree.  (1) A person
commits the offense of assault in the third degree ifthe person: 
(a) Intentionally, knowingly, or recklesslycauses bodily injury to another person[.] 
4 Isabella was the complainant on Counts 1 and 2. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Erroneous instructions are presumptively harmful and
are a ground for reversal unless it affirmatively appears
from the record as a whole that the error was not prejudicial. 
State v. Metcalfe, 129 Hawai# i 206, 222, 297 P.3d 1062, 1078 
(2013) (quoting State v. Arceo, 84 Hawai# i 1, 11, 928 P.2d 843, 
853 (1996)). 
[A]lthough as a general matter forfeited assignments
of error are to be reviewed under the [Hawai <i Rules of 
Penal Procedure ( HRPP)] Rule 52(b) plain error standard of
review, in the case of erroneous jury instructions, thatstandard of review is effectively merged with the HRPP Rule52(a) harmless error standard of review because it is theduty of the trial court to properly instruct the jury. As aresult, once instructional error is demonstrated, we willvacate, without regard to whether timely objection was made,if there is a reasonable possibility that the error
contributed to the defendant's conviction, i.e., that the
erroneous jury instruction was not harmless beyond a
reasonable doubt.  
State v. Nichols, 111 Hawai# i 327, 337, 141 P.3d 974, 984 (2006). 
Inasmuch as "the ultimate responsibility properly to
instruct the jury lies with the trial court," if trial orappellate counsel fail to raise an objection to an erroneousjury instruction as to which there is a reasonablepossibility of contribution to the defendant's convictionand which, consequently, cannot be harmless beyond areasonable doubt, then the instruction, by its very nature,has affected the defendant's substantial rights—to wit, hisor her constitutional rights to a trial by an impartial juryand to due process of law—and, therefore, may be recognizedas plain error. 
State v. Uyesugi, 100 Hawai# i 442, 449, 60 P.3d 843, 850 (2002) 
(brackets omitted) (quoting State v. Rapoza, 95 Hawai# i 321, 326, 
22 P.3d 968, 973 (2001)). 
(1) In State v. Forster, No. CAAP-18-0000816, 2021 WL 
855828 (Haw. App. Mar. 8, 2021) (SDO), this court reviewed 
essentially identical challenges to the Circuit Court's 
"standard" jury instructions 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.7, and 2.2 and 
concluded that the arguments were without merit. For the same 
reasons as articulated in Forster, we conclude that Tuaolo's 
first point of error is without merit. Id. at *2-6; see also 
State v. Char, No. CAAP-19-0000540, 2020 WL 7028600, (Haw. App. Nov. 30, 2020) (SDO) (addressing a similar claim of error 
involving a substituted Hawai# i Pattern Jury Instructions 
Criminal (HAWJIC) instruction).

(2) Tuaolo argues that the Circuit Court erred by 
failing to instruct the jury that self-defense applied to Counts 
3 and 4 because there was evidentiary support to warrant that 
instruction. 
HRS § 703-304 (2014) provides, in pertinent part: 
Use of force in self-protection . (1) Subject to the
provisions of this section and of section 703-308, the use
of force upon or toward another person is justifiable whenthe actor believes that such force is immediately necessaryfor the purpose of protecting himself against the use ofunlawful force by the other person on the present occasion. 
. . . . 
(4) The use of force is not justifiable under this
section: 
(a) To resist an arrest which the actor knows is being made by a law enforcement officer,although the arrest is unlawful; or 
(b) To resist force used by the occupier orpossessor of property or by another person onhis behalf, where the actor knows that theperson using the force is doing so under a claimof right to protect the property, except thatthis limitation shall not apply if: 
(i) The actor is a public officer acting in
the performance of his duties or a personlawfully assisting him therein or a personmaking or assisting in a lawful arrest; or 
(ii) The actor believes that such force is necessary to protect himself against deathor serious bodily injury. 
As we previously stated: 
Our cases have firmly established that a defendant is
entitled to an instruction on every defense or theory of
defense having any support in the evidence, provided such
evidence would support the consideration of that issue by
the jury, no matter how weak, inconclusive, orunsatisfactory the evidence may be. However, this court hasalso noted that where evidentiary support for an asserteddefense, or for any of its essential components, is clearlylacking, it would not be error for the trial court to refuseto charge on the issue or to instruct the jury not toconsider it. 
State v. Yamamoto, 98 Hawai# i 208, 220, 46 P.3d 1092, 1104 (App. 
2002) (underlined emphasis added) (quoting State v. Sawyer, 88 
Hawai#i 325, 333, 966 P,2d 637, 645 (1998)). 
Upon review of the evidence adduced at trial, and as 
recognized by Tuaolo on appeal, the Children merely jumped in 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
between Tuaolo and Isabella during the subject incident and tried 
to separate them. We conclude that the Circuit Court did not err 
in concluding that there was no support in the evidence for the 
defense or theory that Tuaolo believed that his alleged conduct 
at issue with respect to Counts 3 and 4 was immediately necessary 
to protect himself against a use of unlawful force by either or 
both of the Children. 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's December 27, 
2018 Judgment is affirmed.
