Claimants-Appellants David V. Birdsall and Carla J. Birdsall, as 
Co-Trustees of the Birdsall Revocable Living Trust Dated 
March 17, 1999 (the Birdsalls ) appeal from the following 
judgments and orders, entered by the Circuit Court of the First 
Circuit ( circuit court ): (1) a January 2, 2019 Hawaiʻi Rules of 
Civil Procedure ( HRCP) Rule 54(b) "Judgment on Jury Waived Trial 
Held on November 13 – 15, [2017]" (Judgment on Foreclosure and 
Counterclaim ); (2) a July 5, 2019 "Dispositive Order Re 
[Plaintiff/Counterclaim Defendant -Appellee Citimortgage, Inc.'s 
(Citimortgage )] Motion for Recovery of Attorney' s Fees and Costs 
Incurred in Defense of the Birdsall Counterclaim" ( Attorneys' 
Fees Award ); (3) a September 10, 2019 HRCP Rule 5 4(b) "Judgment" 
on an order confirming the foreclosure sale ( Confirmation 
Judgment ); and (4) an October 1, 2019 Order Denying Birdsalls' 
August 23, 2019 Motion for Stay of the [Attorneys' Fees Award] 
(Order Denying Stay ).1 
The Birdsalls raise eleven points of error which 
collectively challenge the circuit court's orders, judgments, 
findings, and conclusions denying the Birdsalls' counterclaims 
for quiet title and declaratory relief, excluding the Birdsalls' 
proposed trial ex hibits, granting Citimortgage's affirmative 
foreclosure claim, granting Citimortgage's request for

Birdsalls' respective requests to stay the Judgment on 
Foreclosure and Counterclaim and the Attorneys' Fees Award 
pending the appeal.

summary judgment de novo. Ibbetson v. Kaiawe, 143 Hawaiʻi 1, 10,

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve the 
Birdsalls' arguments as follows:2 
(1) The Birdsalls first contend the mortgage on the 
subject property ( Mortgage ), and the accompanying promissory 
note (Note), were void when made because the initial holder of 
the Mortgage and Note, ABN AMRO Mortgage Group, Inc. ( ABN), did 
not exist at that time.3 It is undisputed that ABN had merged 
with and into Citimortgage before the Mortgage and Note were 
executed. The Birdsalls contend that ABN is a "dead" 
corporation, and that it could not, as such, enter into a 
contract. 
It is undisputed that Citimortgage is a New York 
corporation, and was the surviving entity in the merger with 
ABN. New York Banking Law § 602(3) (McKinney 1966), which 
2   We have reordered the Birdsalls' points of error, and we address 
only the discernible arguments that the Birdsalls raise in their opening 
brief. Hawaii Ventures, LLC v. Otaka, Inc., 114 Hawaiʻ i 438, 477, 164 P.3d 
696, 735 (2007) ("[T]he court may disregard points of error when the 
appellant fails to present discernible arguments supporting those assignments 
of error[.]")  (citation omitted) .   Section (1) of this disposition addresses 
the contentions  set forth on  pp.  26-29 and 39- 40  of the Birdsalls' opening 
brief.  
3 Citimortgage sued to foreclose the Mortgage. The mortgagors of 
the subject property are Defendants /Cross-Claim Defendants -Appellees Michael 
Costa Brum, Sr. and Julie Pier rette Brum (the Brums). The subject property 
was owned by the Birdsalls at the time Citimor tgage sued to foreclose , the 
Birdsalls having previously acquired the subject property via quitclaim deed, 
subject to all encumbrances. The Birdsalls counterclaimed, disputing 
Citimortgage's entitlement to foreclose.

governs mergers of banking corporations under New York law,  
provides that,  4 
any reference to a merged corporation in any contract, will or 
document, whether executed  or taking effect before or  after the 
merger, shall be considered a reference to the receiving 
corporation if not inconsistent with the other provisions of the contract, will or document[.]  
(Emphasis added). Under New York law, a merged corporation may 
thus execute a contract post -merger, and the Birdsalls identify 
no provision in the Mortgage or Note suggesting the loan funds 
must be provided by ABN, such that it would be inconsistent with 
their terms to consider the references to ABN as references to 
Citimortgage. The circuit court did not, therefore, err in 
determining that the Mortgage and Note were valid as to 
Citimortgage. 
(2) The Birdsalls contend Citimortgage "flunked" the 
test to establish standing to foreclose by failing to prove it 
4 Citimortgage, into which ABN merged, is a New York corporation. 
It thus appears New York Banking Law § 602 controls with respect to the 
merger. Though ABN was a Delaware corporation, the corporate merger statutes 
of Delaware, Hawaiʻi, and New York all suggest that the laws of the 
jurisdiction of the surviving entity govern the effect of the merger. See 
generally Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, § 252 (West 2017); N.Y. Bus. Corp. Law § 907 
(McKinney 2023); Hawaii Revised Statutes §§ 414 -311 (2004), 414 -311.6 
(2004). New York Business Corporation Law contains general provisions 
governing corporate merger s. However, New York Banking Law § 602 applies 
specifically to lenders, and expressly addresses the effect of a contract by 
a merged entity executed after the merger. See Matter of Khan v. Annucci , 
186 A.D.3d 1370, 1372 (N.Y. App. Div. 2020) ( "In the case of a conflict 
between a general statute and a special statute governing the same subject 
matter, the general statute must yield. ") (citation s omitted) .

owned the Mortgage and Note at the time the complaint was filed.5 
They assert that the allonge to the Note (the Allonge), which 
was purportedly indorsed in blank by Citimortgage, and 
thereafter never left Citimortgage's possession, is "a phony" 
because the signature was forged, the signer was not employed by 
Citimortgage, and it was signed after the complaint was filed. 
These contentions lack merit. 
To establish standing to foreclose, the "plaintiff 
must necessarily prove its entitlement to enforce the note" at 
the time the complaint was filed, "as it is the default on the 
note that gives rise to the action." Bank of America, N.A. v. 
Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawaiʻi 361, 368, 390 P.3d 1248, 1255 (2017).  
When an instrument is indorsed in blank, it "becomes payable to 
bearer and may be negotiated by transfer or possession alone 
until specially indorsed." Id. at 370, 390 P.3d at 1257. 
The Birdsalls' conclusory arguments identify no 
credible evidence on which to conclude the circuit court clearly 
erred in determining that the Note was validly indorsed in blank 
before the complaint was filed, and that the original blank -
indorsed Note ther eafter never left Citimortgage's possession. 
(3) The Birdsalls contend the circuit court erred in 
concluding that they would be unjustly enriched if Citimortgage

41 of the Birdsalls' opening brief.

did not possess a valid first priority lien.6 The circuit court 
determined that Citimortgage was entitled to foreclose on the 
apartment as an alternative remedy "if the [N]ote or [M]ortgage 
are found to be invalid." We decline to reach this issue, given 
our conclusion that the Note and Mortgage are not invalid.7 
(4) The Birdsalls contend, without more, "[t]he order 
and judgment confirming the foreclosure sale must be vacated" 
and "[t]he judgment of foreclosure must likewise be vacated[.]"8   
In support of these arguments, the Birdsalls "incorporate by 
reference" their prior contentions that the circuit court erred 
in its findings and conclusions. The Birdsalls' contentions 
lack merit, for the reasons set forth in this disposition.  
(5) The Birdsalls contend the circuit court erred in 
excluding trial exhibits showing that the Mortgage and Note were 
not in ABN's loan "pipeline" at the time of the merger, and 
which thus "proved" that Citimortgage could not be successor in 
interest to ABN.9   The Birdsalls' contention lacks merit.  
6 Section (3) addresses the contentions set forth on pp. 17-21 of 
the Birdsalls' opening brief. 
7 The Birdsalls proceed, on pp. 17, 22-23 of their opening brief, 
to challenge several findings of fact and conclusions of law, entered by the 
circuit court on May 15, 2018, and June 21, 2018. We determine that the 
Birdsalls have not demonstrated that these findings are clearly erroneous, 
nor that these conclusions are wrong. 
8 Section (4) addresses the contentions set forth on pp. 29-30 of 
the Birdsalls' opening brief. 
9 Section (5) addresses the contentions set forth on pp. 30-31 of 
the Birdsalls' opening brief.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The circuit court properly excluded such evidence as 
irrelevant to the triable issues  because  it had already 
previously determined, on summary judgment, that Citimortgage, 
as "successor by merger to ABN" "is the holder" of the Mortgage 
and Note, and therefore held  a "valid first priority mortgage 
lien[.]"  
(6) The Birdsalls contend the circuit court reversibly 
erred in denying their respective stay motions.10   As we have 
rejected the Birdsalls' challenges to the Judgment on  
Foreclosure and Counterclaim, and Confirmation Judgment, the 
Birdsalls' argument regarding the circuit court's denial of its 
Motion to Stay Foreclosure is moot. See  Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. 
v. Ah Chong, No. CAAP-12-0000421, 2015  WL 1265973  (Haw. App. 
Mar. 19, 2015) (SDO).  
Moreover, the Birdsalls fail to provide an adequate 
record on which to conclude that the circuit court abused its 
discretion in denying their motion for a stay of the Attorneys' 
Fees Award. See  In re RGB, 123 Hawaiʻi 1, 27, 229 P.3d 1066, 
1092 (2010) ("[T]he burden is upon appellant . . . to show error 
by reference to matters in the record, and he or she has the 
responsibility of providing an adequate transcript.")  (citations 
omitted).

(7) The Birdsalls contend the Attorneys' Fees Award is 
excessive and not related to work performed in defending against 
their counterclaim.11 For the reasons set forth below, we do not 
reach these arguments; we vacate the Attorneys' Fees Award on 
other grounds, in accordance with Cole v. City and C ounty of 
Honolulu , 154 Hawaiʻi 28, 543 P.3d 460 (2024). 
Citimortgage's post -judgment motion for attorneys' 
fees and costs ( Motion for Fees and Costs ) is deemed filed on 
January 2, 2019 , for the purpose of calculating the 90 -day 
period to resolve the motion . Buscher v. Boning, 114 Hawaiʻi 
202, 221, 159 P.3d 814, 833 (2007) (deeming a prematurely filed 
post-judgment motion for attorneys' fees and costs to be filed 
"immediately after the judgment becomes final for the purpose of 
calculating the 90 -day period" to resolve the motion, under 
Hawaiʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure ( HRAP) Rule 4(a)(3)). The 
circuit court thus had until April 2, 2019, to resolve the 
motion. See Cole, 154 Hawaiʻi at 31-32, 543 P.3d at 463-64 ("The 
second clause [of HRAP Rule 4(a)(3)] requires the court to enter 
that post -judgment order within 90 days after the party files 
the motion. . . . Courts have no power to rule on a post -
judgment motion after the 90 -day period. . . . [HRAP

the Birdsalls' opening brief.

Rule 4(a)(3)] nullifies an order entered 90 days after a post-
judgment motion."). 
The circuit court disposed of the Motion for Fees and 
Costs via two orders: (1) a November 21, 2018 "Interim Order,"  
which ruled that Citimortgage was entitled to an award of 
reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, and (2) the July 5, 2019 
Attorneys' Fees Award, which awarded the actual fees and costs, 
thereby resolving the Motion for Fees and Costs. Because the Attorneys' Fees Award was entered after  expiration of the 90-day 
deadline in HRAP Rule 4(a)(3), it is nullified. In the 
circumstances here, and in light of prior 
Hawaiʻi case law, we 
conclude that Citimortgage may reassert its claims for 
attorneys' fees and costs upon remand.   See  Victoria Ward Ctr., 
L.L.C.  v. Gold Guys Holdings, LLC, Nos. CAAP-16-0000211, CAAP-
16-0000581, CAAP-16-0000622, 2019 WL 2635689, at *12 (Haw. App. 
June 27, 2019) (mem. op.)  (construing  predecessor version of 
HRAP Rule 4(a)(3));  In re Int’l Union of Painters & Allied 
Trades, Painters Local Union 1791 v. Endo Painting Serv., Inc., 
Nos. CAAP-12-0000661, CAAP-12-0001094, CAAP-13-0000187, 2015 WL  3649836, at *4 (Haw. App. June 10, 2015) (mem. op.)  (same).  
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the Attorneys' 
Fees Award. We affirm all other orders and judgments appealed
