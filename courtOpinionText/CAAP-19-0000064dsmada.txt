APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 17-1-0034(1)) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By:  Reifurth, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
appellate jurisdiction over Defendant/Counterclaim-Plaintiff/ 
Third-Party Plaintiff/Appellant Rising Sun, LLC's (Rising Sun) 
appeal from the Honorable Rhonda I.L. Loo's December 31, 2018 
order granting Third-Party Defendant/Appellee Salesforce.com's 
(Salesforce.com) motion to dismiss Rising Sun's third-party 
complaint (incorrectly referred to as a "counterclaim") against 
Salesforce.com, because the circuit court has neither adjudicated 
nor entered judgment on  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
• Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellee WCG,
Inc.'s (CG) three-count complaint against RisingSun, and 
• Rising Sun's three-count counterclaim against WCG, 
which are both still unresolved and pending before the circuit 
court in Civil No. 17-1-0034(1). 
Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 641-1(a) (2016) 
authorizes appeals to the Hawai# i Intermediate Court of Appeals 
from final judgments, orders, or decrees.  Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules 
of court."  HRS § 641-1(c).  Rule 58 of the Hawai# i Rules of 
Civil Procedure (HRCP) requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document."  Based on this requirement 
under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of 
Hawai# i has held that 
"[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor 
of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to 
HRCP [Rule] 58[.]"  Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 
Hawai# i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994).  "Thus, based on 
Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been 
reduced to a separate judgment."  Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 
Hawai# i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008); Bailey v. 
DuVauchelle, 135 Hawai# i 482, 489, 353 P.3d 1024, 1031 (2015). 
The December 31, 2018 order is interlocutory, and the record 
shows that the circuit court is not yet ready to enter final 
judgment as to all claims in Civil No. 17-1-0034(1), as 
demonstrated by the parties' February 26, 2019 stipulation to 
continue trial pending this appeal. 
Although exceptions to the final judgment requirement 
exist under the doctrine in Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848) 
(the Forgay
 doctrine), the collateral order doctrine, and HRS 
§ 641-1(b) (2016), the December 31, 2018 interlocutory order does not satisfy the requirements for appealability under the Forgay 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
doctrine, the collateral order doctrine, or HRS § 641-1(b).  See 
Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai# i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) 
(regarding the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 
Hawai# i 319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding the three 
requirements for the collateral order doctrine); HRS § 641-1(b) (regarding the requirements for an appeal from an interlocutory 
order).  Absent an appealable final judgment, we lack appellate 
jurisdiction over appellate court case number CAAP-19-0000064. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court 
case number CAAP-19-0000064 is dismissed for lack of appellate 
jurisdiction.
