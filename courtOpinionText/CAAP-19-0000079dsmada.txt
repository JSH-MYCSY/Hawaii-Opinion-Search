STATE OF HAWAI# I
, Plaintiff-Appellee, 
v. 
CARY CANTERE, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1PC141000181) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Reifurth and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Upon review of this appeal filed by Defendant-Appellant 
Cary Cantere (Cantere), pro se, from the Honorable Dexter D. 
Del Rosario's June 3, 2015  judgment of conviction in circuit 
court criminal case number 1PC141000181, it appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction because Cantere's January 23, 2019 notice 
of appeal is untimely under Rule 4(b)(1) of the Hawai# i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP).  1
As a result of Cantere's plea of no contest to 
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawaii's February 4, 2014 indictment for three counts of sexual assault in the third degree in 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707-732 (2014), the 
circuit court entered both a June 3, 2015 judgment of conviction 
and an October 9, 2015 amended judgment of conviction on all 
three counts, which were immediately appealable pursuant to HRS 
1 Cantere's letter dated January 23, 2019, which we deem to be his
notice of appeal, references a June 6, 2015 sentencing date. We understand this 
to refer to the June 3, 2015 judgment of conviction in 1PC141000181. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
§ 641-11 (2016).  HRAP Rule 4(b)(1) requires that, "[i]n a 
criminal case, the notice of appeal shall be filed within 30 days 
after entry of the judgment or order appealed from."  The issue 
whether an appellant "compli[ed] with the requirement of the 
timely filing of a notice of appeal, as set forth in HRAP 
Rule 4(b)(1), is jurisdictional."  State v. Bohannon, 102 Hawai‘i 
228, 234, 74 P.3d 980, 986 (2003) (citations, internal quotation 
marks, and original brackets omitted). Because Cantere is 
currently a pro se prisoner, we utilize Cantere's date of 
signature in his notice of appeal, January 23, 2019, as the 
earliest possible date on which he tendered his notice of appeal 
to prison officials for mailing.  See Setala v. J.C. Penney
Company, 97 Hawai# i 484, 485, 40 P.3d 886, 887 (2002) (deeming 
the effective date of a pro se prisoner's notice of appeal to be the day on which he tendered it to prison officials).  But, 
regardless of whether we acknowledge the entry of the June 3, 
2015 judgment of conviction or the October 9, 2015 amended 
judgment of conviction as the event that triggered the thirty-day 
time period under HRAP Rule 4(b)(1) for filing a notice of 
appeal, the January 23, 2019 effective date of Cantere's notice 
of appeal is untimely because he waited more than three years to 
assert his appeal.  Absent a timely appeal, we lack appellate 
jurisdiction. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court 
case number CAAP-19-0000079 is dismissed for lack of appellate 
jurisdiction.
