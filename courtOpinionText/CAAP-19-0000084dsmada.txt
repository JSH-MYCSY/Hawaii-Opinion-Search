APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD 
(CASE NO. AB 2015-371(WH); DCD NO. 9-14-45010) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL 
(By:  Reifurth, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that: 
(1) On February 6, 2019, Claimant-Appellant Kenneth M. 
Skahan (Skahan), pro se, conventionally filed the notice of appeal with the Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board 
(LIRAB); 
(2)
On February 8, 2019, the LIRAB clerk electronically 
filed the notice of appeal, which created appeal number CAAP-19-
0000084; 
(3) Skahan failed to pay the appellate filing and 
docketing fees with the notice of appeal, as required by Hawai# i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 3(a); 
(4) On February 11, 2019, the LIRAB clerk notified 
Skahan to pay the filing fee by February 26, 2019, or request a fee waiver, otherwise the clerk is not required to prepare the 
record on appeal.  See HRAP Rule 11(b)(2); NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(5) On May 7, 2019, the appellate clerk entered a 
default of the record on appeal, informing Skahan that the time 
to docket the appeal expired on April 9, 2019, he had not paid 
the filing fee or obtained an order allowing him to proceed on 
appeal in forma pauperis, the matter would be brought to the 
court's attention on May 17, 2019, for action that may include 
dismissal of the appeal, and he could seek relief from default by 
motion; 
(6) Skahan took no further action in this appeal; and 
(7) An appeal may be dismissed where the record on 
appeal has not been prepared because the appellant failed to pay the required fees or obtain an order allowing the appellant to 
proceed in forma pauperis.  HRAP Rule 11(b)(2), (c)(2). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed.
