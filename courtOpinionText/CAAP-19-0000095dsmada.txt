IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
ECKARD BRANDES, INC., Appellant-Appellee, v.
DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, Appellee-Appellee,
and SCOTT FOYT, Intervenor-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 18-1-0011-01) 
ORDER 
DISMISSING APPELLATE COURT CASE NUMBER 
CAAP-19-0000095 FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By:  Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Chan, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record in appellate court case 
number CAAP-19-0000095, it appears that we lack appellate 
jurisdiction over the appeal that Intervenor-Appellant Scott Foyt 
(Foyt) has asserted from the Honorable James S. Kawashima's 
December 19, 2018 judgment in favor of Appellant-Appellee Eckard 
Brandes, Inc. (Eckard Brandes), and against Appellee-Appellee 
Department of Labor and Industrial Relations (Department of Labor 
and Industrial Relations) in Civil No. 18-1-0011-01, because Foyt 
did not file his February 15, 2019 notice of appeal within thirty 
days after entry of the December 19, 2018 judgment as 
Rule 4(a)(1) of the Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 
required for a timely appeal. 
We recognize that HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B) authorizes an 
extension of time after the expiration of the initial thirty-day NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
time period under HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) for filing a notice of appeal 
if the movant can show "excusable neglect" for the delay: 
(4) Extensions of Time to File the Notice of Appeal. 
(A) . . . . 
(B) Requests for Extensions of Time After Expiration
of the Prescribed Time. The court or agency appealed from,
upon a showing of excusable neglect, may extend the time forfiling the notice of appeal upon motion filed not later than30 days after the expiration of the time prescribed bysubsections (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this rule. However, nosuch extension shall exceed 30 days past the prescribedtime. Notice of an extension motion filed after the expiration of the prescribed time shall be given to theother parties in accordance with the rules of the court oragency appealed from. 
(Emphasis added.)  Hawai# i appellate courts review the granting 
of an extension under HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B) according to "the 
abuse of discretion standard."  Hall v. Hall, 95 Hawai# i 318, 
319, 22 P.3d 965, 966 (2001).  Under such a review, "the issue before [the appellate court] is whether the trial court abused 
its discretion in finding that counsel's neglect in failing to 
timely file a notice of appeal was excusable."  Id. at 320, 22 
P.3d at 967 (citation, internal quotations marks and brackets 
omitted). 
On February 13, 2019, the Honorable James S. Kawashima 
entered an order granting Foyt's January 25, 2019 post-judgment 
HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B) motion to extend the thirty-day time period 
under HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) for filing a notice of appeal from the 
December 19, 2018 judgment.  The February 13, 2019 order did not 
contain a specific extended due date for Foyt to file his notice 
of appeal, but it contained an express finding of "excusable 
neglect" for an extension of time. 
The Supreme Court of Hawai# i
 has defined "excusable 
neglect" as "some mistake or inadvertence within the control of 
the movant[.]"  Enos v. Pacific Transfer & Warehouse, Inc., 80 
Hawai# i 345, 352, 910 P.2d 116, 123 (1996).  More specifically, 
the supreme court has held that, "as a matter of law, only plausible misconstruction, but not mere ignorance, of the law or 
rules rises to the level of excusable neglect."  Hall, 95 Hawai# i
 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
at 320, 22 P.3d at 967 (citation and internal quotation marks 
omitted); see also Enos, 80 Hawai# i at 355, 910 P.2d at 126 
(holding that "excusable neglect" was not demonstrated by counsel's failure to read and comply with the plain language of 
the applicable procedural rules, and that the trial court 
therefore abused its discretion in granting a motion to extend 
time to file a notice of appeal). 
With respect to the initial thirty-day time period 
under HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) for filing a notice of appeal in the 
instant case, the thirtieth day after entry of the December 19, 
2018 judgment was Friday, January 18, 2019.  Nevertheless, 
counsel for Foyt admitted in a declaration in support of Foyt's 
January 25, 2019 post-judgment HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B) motion to 
extend the deadline for filing a notice of appeal that on 
January 16, 2019, (i.e., two days prior to the expiration of the 
thirty-day time period under HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) at the end of the 
day on January 18, 2019) he was already speaking with opposing 
counsel about Foyt's intent to intent to intervene in Civil 
No. 18-100011-01 for the purpose of asserting an appeal from the 
December 19, 2018 judgment.  Although Foyt had an opportunity to 
intervene and pursue an appeal before January 18, 2019,  Foyt 
waited to file his post-judgment HRCP Rule 24 motion to intervene until January 25, 2019, which, in turn, necessitated Foyt's 
January 25, 2019 post-judgment HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B) motion for an 
extension of time to file his notice of appeal.  The record does 
not support Foyt's contention that Foyt's failure to timely 
intervene and timely appeal constituted "excusable neglect."  In 
other words, Foyt and his counsel's failure to comply with the 
plain language of the applicable procedural rules did not 
constitute "excusable neglect" that would warrant an extension of 
time under HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B). 1

proceedings as well. 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
To the extent that the circuit court found "excusable 
neglect" and granted an extension of time, the circuit court 
abused its discretion.  Foyt did not file his February 15, 2019 
notice of appeal within thirty days after entry of the December 
19, 2018 judgment, as HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) required.  The failure to 
file a timely notice of appeal in a civil matter is a 
jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot waive and the 
appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise of judicial 
discretion.  Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127, 
1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or justice is 
authorized to change the jurisdictional requirements contained in 
Rule 4 of these rules."); HRAP Rule 26(e) ("The reviewing court 
for good cause shown may relieve a party from a default 
occasioned by any failure to comply with these rules, except the 
failure to give timely notice of appeal."). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED AND DECREED that this 
case is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
