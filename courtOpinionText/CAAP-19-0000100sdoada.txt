IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI#I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
FRED E. HOFER, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
(CASE NO. 3DTC-15-012343)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Fred E. Hofer ( Hofer), pro se,
appeals from a Judgment and Notice of Entry of Judgment, entered
on December 3, 2015 ( Judgment), by the District Court of the
Third Circuit ( District Court ).  The District Court convicted
Hofer of one count of Driving Without a Valid Driver's License,
in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS ) ยง 286-102 (2007 &
Supp. 2015), and one count of Operating a Motor Vehicle Without
Liability Insurance, in violation of HRS ยง 431:10C-104 (2005).1
On appeal, Hofer contends he is a "duly naturalized
subject to this Kingdom" and appears to assert one or more points

of error arguing that the District Court violated his due process
rights as it lacked jurisdiction over him because the State of
Hawai#i is not a lawful government. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve Hofer's point(s) of error as follows:
In State v. Kaulia, 128 Hawai#i 479, 487, 291 P.3d 377,
385 (2013), the Hawai# i Supreme Court held that "whatever may be
said regarding the lawfulness of its origins, the State of
Hawai#i is now a lawful government.  Individuals claiming to be
citizens of the Kingdom and not of the State are not exempt from
application of the State's laws."  (Citations omitted; format
altered); see also State v. Fergerstrom, 106 Hawai#i 43, 55, 101
P.3d 652, 664 (App. 2004), aff'd, 106 Hawai# i 41, 101 P.3d 225
(2004).
Hofer's arguments to the contrary are wholly without
merit.
Accordingly, the District Court's December 3, 2015
Judgment is affirmed.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, November 29, 2019.
