IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
RANELL BANKS, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
PUNA DIVISION 
(CASE NO. 3DTC-18-016323) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL 
(By:  Reifurth, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that: 
(1) On February 25, 2019, Defendant-Appellant Ranell 
Banks (Banks), pro se, filed a notice of appeal and statement of jurisdiction; 
(2) On April 17, 2019, the district court clerk filed 
the record on appeal; 
(3) On April 18, 2019, the appellate clerk notified the 
parties that the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief were 
due on or before April 29, 2019, and May 28, 2019, respectively, 
despite Banks having filed the statement of jurisdiction with the 
notice of appeal; 
(4) Banks did not file the opening brief or request an 
extension of time; 
(5) On May 31, 2019, the appellate clerk notified Banks 
that the time for filing the statement of jurisdiction and 
opening brief had expired, the matter would be called to the NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
court's attention on June 10, 2019, for appropriate action, which 
could include dismissal of the appeal, under Hawai# i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rules 12.1(e) and 30, and Banks may request relief from default by motion; and 
(6) The appellate clerk mailed the April 18, 2019 
notice of entering case on calendar and the May 31, 2019 default 
notice to Banks at the addresses indicated in the notice of 
appeal and record on appeal.  The United States Postal Service 
returned the notices as undeliverable.  Banks has not filed a 
notice of change of address, as required by HRAP Rule 25(f).  The 
default notice erroneously stated Banks failed to file the 
statement of jurisdiction but Banks took no further action in 
this appeal with respect to the opening brief. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed for failure to file the opening brief, under HRAP 
Rule 30. 
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, June 14, 2019.
