SR, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
J
R, Defendant-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(FC-D NO. 18-1-0032) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record for the underlying divorce 
case in FC-D No. 18-1-0032, it appears that we lack appellate 
jurisdiction over Plaintiff-Appellant SR's (SR), pro se, appeal 
from the Honorable Adrianne N. Heely's 
• January 3, 2019 judgment denying two of SR's
motions for pre-decree relief, and granting inpart, denying in part, and reserving in part threeof Defendant-Appellee JR's (JR) motions for pre-decree relief, regarding primarily the issues ofchild custody, child support and spousal support, 
• January 3, 2019 interlocutory order awarding JRwith attorneys' fees and costs as the prevailingparty in the five motions for pre-decree relief,and 
• January 30, 2019 interlocutory order denying SR'smotion for reconsideration of the January 3, 2019judgment and January 3, 2019 interlocutory order, 
because the family court has not yet dissolved the marriage of SR 
and JR. Eaton v. Eaton, 7 Haw. App. 111, 118-19, 748 P.2d 801, 
805 (1987). Absent an appealable final judgment, order or decree NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that dissolves the marriage of SR and JR in the underlying 
divorce case, we lack appellate jurisdiction over this appeal, 
and SR's appeal is premature. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number 
CAAP-19-0000118 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
