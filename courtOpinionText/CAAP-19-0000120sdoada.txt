SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: 
Ginoza, Chief Judge, Hiraoka and Nakasone, JJ.) 
This case arises from a workers' compensation claim 
asserted by Claimant-Appellee-Appellee Adam L. Josiah (
Claimant 
Josiah) due to a work injury that occurred on September 10, 2009.
The issue before us is whether the Labor and Industrial Relations
Appeals Board (LIRAB) properly determined that Appellant-
Appellant Special Compensation Fund (SCF) must pay a portion of 
Claimant Josiah's permanent partial disability (PPD) benefits 
under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 386-33 (2015).   SCF 1 
 
1 HRS § 386-33 provides, in relevant part: 
(a) Where prior to any injury an employee suffers from a 
previous permanent partial disability already existing prior
to the injury for which compensation is claimed, and the 
disability resulting from the injury combines with the 
previous disability, whether the previous permanent partialdisability was incurred during past or present periods of

contends it is not liable under HRS § 386-33, and that 
Employer-Appellee-Appellee Target Corporation (Employer Target) 
and Insurance Adjuster-Appellee Sedgwick CMS - Hawaii (Insurer
Sedgwick) must pay the full amount of the PPD benefits. 2
SCF appeals from LIRAB's Decision and Order (Decision 
and Order) filed on January 30, 2019, which affirmed a decision 
by the Director of Labor and Industrial Relations (Director) 
apportioning liability for Claimant Josiah's PPD benefits between 
SCF and Employer Target/Insurer Sedgwick. 
The key issue in this appeal is whether Claimant Josiah 
suffered from a "previous permanent partial disability" before the subject work accident in this case, such that HRS § 386-33 requires SCF to pay a portion of Claimant Josiah's PPD benefits. 
As discussed below, the record does not contain 
evidence that Claimant Josiah suffered from a "disability" prior 
employment, 
to result in a greater permanent partial
disability or in permanent total disability or in death, then 
weekly benefits shall be paid as follows: 
(1) In cases where the disability resulting from the 
injury combines with the previous disability to resultin greater permanent partial disability the employershall pay the employee compensation for the employee'sactual permanent partial disability but for not more than one hundred four weeks; the balance if any of compensation payable to the employee for the employee'sactual permanent partial disability shall thereafter be paid out of the special compensation fund . . . ; 
. . . . 
(b) Notwithstanding 
subsection (a), where the director or the 
appellate board determines that the previous permanent partial 
disability amounted to less than that necessary to support an 
award of thirty-two weeks of compensation for permanentpartial disability, there shall be no liability on the specialcompensation fund and the employer shall pay the employee orthe employee's dependents full compensation for the employee'spermanent partial or total disability or death.

from the case pursuant to a stipulation for dismissal filed in LIRAB on April6, 2018.

to the subject work injury. Accordingly, we reverse the Decision 
and Order. 
I. Brief Background 
On September 10, 2009, Claimant Josiah sustained an 
injury to his left knee while working for Employer Target. In a report dated May 27, 2011 (2011 Report), Employer Target's 
medical expert, Vern K. Sasaki, M.D. (Dr. Sasaki), issued his 
"diagnostic impression" based on his examination of Claimant 
Josiah and review of imaging studies, opining that Claimant Josiah suffered from an acute medial meniscal tear to the left knee and preexisting bilateral knee osteoarthritis.
3 Dr. Sasaki 
determined that the osteoarthritis existed prior to the work injury and that it was probably aggravated by the injury. Dr. Sasaki opined that Claimant Josiah had a 9% lower extremity (left knee) impairment, and that 30% of that impairment was attributed to the preexisting osteoarthritis. This assessment was not sufficient to meet the threshold requirement for SCF liability. 
In February 2012, Claimant Josiah, Employer Target, and 
Insurer Sedgwick entered into a Stipulation and Settlement Agreement and Order (2012 Agreement) stipulating, inter alia, 
that SCF did not have to pay Claimant Josiah any disability 
benefits. The Director approved the 2012 Agreement. 
On September 18, 2015, Dr. Sasaki produced another 
report, stating that Claimant Josiah's condition had "significantly deteriorated" since the 2011 Report. Dr. Sasaki recommended that Claimant Josiah receive a total knee replacement. Following the total knee replacement surgery in 2015, Dr. Sasaki produced a report dated August 9, 2016 (2016 
Report) with an amended assessment that Claimant Josiah had a 50%

left knee impairment. Dr. Sasaki attributed 30% of Claimant 
Josiah's impairment to the preexisting osteoarthritis. 
After a hearing, the Director found that Claimant 
Josiah suffered 55% PPD of the left leg for the left knee.4 The 
Director ordered, inter alia, that SCF be joined for the work injury claim and that pursuant to HRS §§ 386-32(a) (2015) and 386-33, Employer Target and SCF had to pay their respective portion of Claimant Josiah's compensation for 55% PPD. 
On September 15, 2017, SCF appealed the case to LIRAB 
on the issue of apportionment with Employer Target/Insurer Sedgwick. LIRAB affirmed the Director's decision on January 30, 2019. This timely appeal followed. 
On appeal, SCF asserts that: LIRAB clearly erred in its 
findings of fact (FOF) 15 through 19; and LIRAB was incorrect in 
its conclusion of law (COL) 1, concluding that Claimant Josiah's 
PPD benefits should be apportioned between Employer 
Target/Insurer Sedgwick and SCF.

The FOFs and COL that SCF challenges state: 
15. The Board finds that Dr. Sasaki's August
9, 2016 report is the initial rating report indicating
evidence of preexisting disability for which the SCF could be liable. 
16. There being no other medical opinion
regarding apportionment between the work injury andClaimant's pre-existing condition, the Board creditsDr. Sasaki's 30% apportionment to pre-existingconditions. 
17. 30% apportionment of 55% PPD of the
leg is equal to 133.6126 weeks (55% permanentimpairment x 288 weeks x $725 maximum weeklycompensation rate x 30% apportionment = $34,452.00 ÷$257.85 weekly benefit rate = 133.6126 weeks). 
18. 55% PPD of the leg is equal to
445.3752 weeks (55% permanent impairment x 288 weeks x$725 maximum weekly compensation rate = $114,840.00 ÷$257.85 weekly benefit rate = 445.3752 weeks).

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 
1.
 The Board concludes that permanent
disability should be apportioned between Employer/Insurance Carrier and the Special Compensation Fund. 
(Emphases added.) 
SCF challenges FOFs 15, 16, and 19 for erroneously 
relying on the worsening of Claimant Josiah's condition after the 
work accident, as set out in Dr. Sasaki's 2016 Report, which SCF contends is not pertinent to whether Claimant Josiah had a preexisting disability, i.e., disability before the work incident. SCF also challenges FOF 17 as erroneous for relying on an improperly inflated disability rating to apportion liability for Claimant Josiah's PPD award to SCF. Employer Target/Insurer Sedgwick argue that Dr. Sasaki's 30% PPD apportionment in the 2016 Report was to Claimant Josiah's "pre-existing condition, not to the worsening of his condition from the work injury." 
HRS § 386-1 (2015) defines "disability" as "loss or 
impairment of a physical or mental function." A "finding that a claimant had a preexisting disability must be based upon some evidence in the record showing that the claimant had an actual loss or impairment of a physical or mental function before the work accident." Pave, 152 Hawai# i at 176, 524 P.3d at 367; see 
also Agasiva v. Realty Laua, LLC, No. CAAP-17-0000596, 2023 WL 2943018, at *6 (Haw. Ct. App. Apr. 14, 2023) (citing Pave, 152 Hawai#i at 169, 524 P.3d at 360; HRS § 386-1). Moreover, 
"[t]here must . . . be substantial evidence in the record supporting LIRAB's determination that SCF is obligated to pay PPD benefits because of a preexisting disability capable of

supporting at least 32 weeks of compensation." Pave, 152 Hawai# i 
at 180, 524 P.3d at 371. 
In Pave, a consolidated appeal, this court ruled that 
"LIRAB [had] incorrectly equated a preexisting 'condition' with a 
preexisting 'disability.'" Id.There, the issue in each appeal 
was whether there was evidence that the claimant's asymptomatic preexisting physical condition had caused any disability, i.e., loss or impairment of a physical or mental function, before the work accident. See id. at 169, 524 P.3d at 360. This court 
reversed LIRAB's decision and orders in both appeals, concludingthat:  
In each of these cases, there was no expert opinion or
other evidence that the injured person's asymptomatic preexisting condition had caused any actual "disability"— that is, "loss or impairment of a physical or mentalfunction" — before the person's work accident. Under those circumstances, it was error for LIRAB to apportionliability for the person's PPD award to SCF.
 Id. at 185, 524 P.3d at 376. 
In this case, LIRAB incorrectly equated a preexisting 
"condition" and "factors" with a preexisting "disability." LIRAB 
made the following unchallenged findings: 
9. After the [2012 Agreement], Claimant's 
knee condition worsened, and he underwent a total knee
replacement. 
10. Because of the total knee replacement,
Claimant's permanent impairment increased.. . . . 
12. In his August 9, 2016 report, Dr. Sasaki 
apportioned 30% of Claimant's permanent impairment after the total knee replacement to pre-existing factors. 
13. Dr. Sasaki also opined that Claimant's
work injury resulted in progressive posttraumaticarthritis and end-stage osteoarthritis, that had 
significantly deteriorated since his first report. 
14. [LIRAB] finds that Dr. Sasaki's ratings
were consistent with the [American Medical Association]Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Fifth Edition. Accordingly, his ratings were, in part, basedupon the extent of Claimant's surgical treatment.. . . . 
20. There being no evidence to the
contrary, [LIRAB] credits Dr. Sasaki's opinion and finds that Claimant's pre-existing condition further

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
deteriorated after his September 10, 2009 work injury,
thus requiring a total knee replacement. 
(Emphases added.) 
Further, the 2016 Report's findings and recommendations 
are, in relevant part, as follows: 
Based on the history, physical examination, and reviewof medical records, there is evidence of bilateral knee 
arthritis. A bone study on 12/01/15 revealed degenerative disease in both knees. This is an indication of some underlying, pre-existing bilateral 
knee osteoarthritis. Therefore, apportionment would beindicated in this claim. 
In my best judgment, 70% of the current impairment can
be attributed to the injury of record which permanentlyaggravated an intermittently symptomatic, preexisting,degenerative joint disease of the left knee, and 30% can 
be attributed to preexisting osteoarthritic changes. Myrationale for this apportionment is that the claimant,based on the available medical records of Dr. Lawler,his primary care physician, did not complain of left 
knee pain between 2007 and the time of the current injury. 
There was a recorded history of left knee pain in the past; however, medical records prior to 2007 were not available for review. 
(Emphases added) (other emphasis omitted). 
Dr. Sasaki opined that Claimant Josiah's preexisting 
osteoarthritis deteriorated after the work accident, thus 
requiring a total knee replacement. However, Dr. Sasaki's 2016Report did not analyze whether the preexisting condition had  
caused a preexisting disability, i.e., loss or impairment of 
Claimant Josiah's physical function, prior to the work injury. Instead, LIRAB found that Dr. Sasaki's ratings were based, at least in part, on the extent of Claimant Josiah's impairment following surgical treatment after the work injury. 
Dr. Sasaki 
noted the records indicated no complaint of left knee pain between 2007 and the work injury in September 2009. There were no other medical records available for review. Additionally, Claimant Josiah denied any prior knee injuries.   The record here

unchanged. Thus, the 2016 Report relates back to the "Pertinent Past History"

8 7(...continued)NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
does not contain any evidence that Claimant Josiah had a 
preexisting disability capable of supporting at least 32 weeks of compensation. Thus, FOFs 15, 16 and 19 were clearly erroneous and COL 1 was wrong. 
SCF also challenges FOF 15 as erroneous for ignoring 
the 2011 report. SCF argues that the clear language and purpose of the thirty-two week threshold in HRS § 386-33 is a one-time determination that reduces litigation as intended by the Legislature, which Dr. Sasaki made in the 2011 Report.
8 We need 
not address this issue because none of Dr. Sasaki's reports render opinions that Claimant Josiah had a preexisting "disability." Given this record, there is no evidence that the requirements under HRS § 386-33 were met to trigger SCF's liability to pay a portion of the PPD benefits. 
We conclude that: FOF 15 was clearly erroneous in 
finding that the 2016 Report indicated evidence of "preexisting disability for which the SCF could be liable[;]" FOFs 16 through 19 are clearly erroneous in relying on Dr. Sasaki's 2016 Report and determining that Employer Target/Insurer Sedgwick established an entitlement to apportion PPD benefits with SCF; and COL 1 is wrong that PPD benefits should be apportioned between Employer Target/Insurer Sedgwick and SCF. 
section in the 2011 Report, in which Claimant Josiah denied any prior knee
injuries. 
8 SCF also argues that the 2012 Agreement was a final judgment under
HRS § 386-87(a) (2015), which provides that a "decision of the director shallbe final and conclusive between the parties, except as provided in section386-89, unless within twenty days . . . either party appeals therefrom to theappellate board[.]" Although no appeal was taken from the 2012 Agreement, HRS§ 386-87(a) is subject to HRS § 386-89 (2015), which permits reopening ofcases under specified circumstances. Given our determination that the record lacks evidence of a preexisting disability, we need not address SCF's argumentregarding the 2012 Agreement.
