Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court).1 Appellants also 
challenge the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order 
Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment Against All Defendants and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure 
(Foreclosure Decree) entered by the Circuit Court on June 22, 
2018, as well as the Circuit Court's Order Confirming Foreclosure 
Sale, Approving Commissioner's Report, Allowance of Commissioner's Fees, Attorney's Fees, Costs, Directing Conveyance 
(Confirmation Order) and for Writ of Ejectment (Writ of 
Ejectment), entered on February 12, 2019. On June 22, 2018, the 
Circuit Court entered a final judgment on the Foreclosure Decree 
(Foreclosure Judgment). 
It appears that Appellants seek to raise two related 
points of error on appeal,
2 contending that: (1) the Circuit 
Court erred in entering the Foreclosure Decree; and (2) 
Plaintiff-Appellee The Bank of New York Mellon, formerly known as The Bank of New York as Trustee for the Certificateholders CWALT, Inc., Alternative Loan Trust 2006-23CB Mortgage Pass Through

Rules of Appellate Procedure ( HRAP ) Rule 28(b)(4). 
"Points not presented in
accordance with HRAP Rule 28(b)(4) will be disregarded." Alvarez Fam. Tr. v.

While noncompliance with
HRAP Rule 28(b)(4) may be sufficient to affirm a lower court's judgment, "we

 burden of proof to show that it had possession of the subject 
note at the time that the foreclosure complaint was filed. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised, as well as the relevant legal authorities, we address Appellants' arguments as follows: 
On July 24, 2019, this court entered an order stating, 
inter alia: 
[W]e have appellate jurisdiction over the instant
appeal for the limited purpose of reviewing the [Judgment on
Confirmation Order]. 
The [Judgment on Confirmation Order] is certified
under HRCP Rule 54(b) and appealable pursuant to HRS ยง 667-51(a)(2), and the Appellants' March 11, 2019 notice ofappeal timely invoked our appellate jurisdiction to reviewit under Rule 4(a)(1) of the Hawai #i Rules of Appellate
Procedure. [T]he Appellants' failure to seek timelyappellate review of the circuit court's earlier [ForeclosureJudgment] on the [Foreclosure Decree] pursuant to HRS ยง 667-51(a)(1) rendered that [Foreclosure Judgment] "final andbinding." Mortg. Elec. Registration Sys. Inc. v. Wise, 130
Hawai #i 11, 17, 304 P.3d 1192, 1198 (2013). Thereafter, "in
the context of proceedings to confirm the sale of foreclosedproperty, the judgment of foreclosure has a preclusiveeffect." Id. at 18, 390 P.3d at 1199. Under the doctrine 
of res judicata , the failure of an aggrieved party to timely
appeal from a judgment on the decree of foreclosure pursuantto HRS ยง 657-51(a)(1) precludes subsequent appellate reviewof that judgment on the decree of foreclosure by way of anappeal from a judgment on an order confirming the sale ofthe foreclosed property. Id. at 17-18, 390 P.3d at 1198-99.
In the instant case, the Appellants' March 11, 2019 noticeof appeal designated the [Foreclosure Decree] as one of theappealed documents, but the Appellants are neverthelessprecluded from appellate review of [Foreclosure Judgment]and the related [Foreclosure Decree]. 
However, pursuant to HRS ยง 657-51(a)(2), the
Appellants are entitled to appellate review of [Judgment onConfirmation Order]. 
As we previously stated, Appellants failed to timely 
appeal from the Foreclosure Judgment and Foreclosure Decree, and 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the merits of the Foreclosure Decree are not reviewable in this 
appeal. Wise, 130 Hawai# i at 17, 304 P.3d at 1198; see also Bank 
of N.Y. Mellon v. R. Onaga, Inc., 140 Hawai# i 358, 368, 400 P.3d 
559, 569 (2017) (holding that "[a]n appellant cannot challenge the merits of a foreclosure decree in an appeal of an order confirming sale[]" because "orders confirming sale are separately appealable from the decree of foreclosure.") (brackets and citation omitted); Royce, 2022 WL 17335413 at *2-4 (holding that res judicata precluded self-represented plaintiffs from challenging the foreclosure judgment after they did not timely appeal the judgment). 
Appellants' only arguments pertain to the entry of the 
Foreclosure Decree; Appellants do not raise any arguments challenging the Confirmation Order and/or the Judgment on Confirmation Order. 
Therefore, the Circuit Court's February 12, 2019 
Judgment on Confirmation Order is affirmed.
