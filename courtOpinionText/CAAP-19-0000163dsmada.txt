themselves, filed the notice of appeal creating this case on March 12, 2019, purportedly on behalf of Leland H.Y. Louie, Trustee of the Leland H.Y. Louie Revocable Trust dated December 17, 1994, and Rosa Y. Louie, Trustee of the Rosa Y. Louie Revocable Trust dated December 17, 1994;

3. A non-lawyer trustee may not represent the trust 
in litigation unless they are the real party in interest â€” that 
is, the sole beneficiary of the trust, Tradewinds Hotel, Inc. v. Cochran, 8 Haw. App. 256, 265, 799 P.2d 60, 66 (1990); 
4. The Louies have the burden to show that they are 
the sole beneficiaries of their respective trusts, id. ; 
5. On May 5, 2021, we entered an order for 
supplemental briefing on "whether the Louies are entitled to assert the appeal on behalf of their respective trusts"; 
6. The Louies filed their supplemental brief on 
June 8, 2021, to which they attached copies of the "Short Form Trust Agreement of Leland H.Y. Louie" and the "Short Form Trust Agreement of Rosa Y. Louie"; 
7. The Short Form Trust Agreement of Leland H.Y. 
Louie does not identify the trust's beneficiaries; 
8. The Short Form Trust Agreement of Rosa Y. Louie 
does not identify the trust's beneficiaries; and 
9. The Louies have not sustained their burden to show 
that they are the sole beneficiaries of their respective trusts. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai #i, March 20, 2024.
