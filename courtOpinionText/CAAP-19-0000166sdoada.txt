APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 14-1-1769-08 (JHC))
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Brett C. Arizumi (Arizumi ) appeals
from the "Judgment" (Judgment Confirming Sale ) entered pursuant
to the "Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Confirmation of
Sale, Distribution of Proceeds, and For Writ of Ejectment" ( Order
Confirming Sale ), both entered on February 11, 2019, by the
Circuit Court of the First Circuit ( Circuit Court) in favor of
Plaintiff-Appellee U.S. Bank Trust, National Association asNOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Trustee for WG2 Mortgage Trust VII, Series 2013-1 ( U.S. Bank ). 
Arizumi also appeals from the "Order Denying Defendant Brett C.
Arizumi's Renewed Motion for Relief from Judgment Pursuant to
HRCP Rule 60(b)(3) and (4), Based on Lack of Subject Matter
Standing Jurisdiction, Fraud on the Court, Supervening Authority,
and Violations of Due Process of Law" ( Order Denying HRCP Rule
60(b) Motion), also entered on February 11, 2019.1
In his points of error Arizumi contends that "[t]he
lower court committed reversible error by refusing to grant
Arizumi's Rule 60(b) Motions and to set aside its prior orders
and judgments, for each of the following reasons:" (1) it
misapplied the subject matter jurisdictional standing
requirements of Bank of America, N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 139
Hawai#i 361, 390 P.3d 1248 (2017) to this case by misconstruing
the evidentiary worth of U.S. Bank's verified complaint in
contravention of Capital One N.A. v. Klika, Nos. CAAP-14-0001322
& CAAP-16-0000620, 2018 WL 2011728 ( Hawai#i App. Apr. 30, 2018);
(2) it misapplied Hawai#i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP ) Rule
60(b)(4)'s timeless prohibition against the enforcement of void
judgments based upon void transactional documents created in
violation of court orders; and (3) it misapplied HRCP Rule
60(b)(4)'s timeless prohibition against the enforcement of void
judgments based upon fraud on the court. 
Upon careful review of the record and briefs submitted
by the parties and having given due consideration to the
arguments and issues they raise, as well as the relevant
statutory and case law, we resolve Arizumi's points of error as
follows, and we affirm.  
On August 19, 2014, U.S. Bank initiated this
foreclosure action against, inter alia, Arizumi.  Arizumi did not
respond to U.S. Bank's complaint and an entry of default was
entered against him on February 2, 2015.  On May 18, 2015, U.S.
1  The Honorable Jeannette H. Castagnetti presided over the relevant
proceedings.
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Bank filed its motion for summary judgment and decree of
foreclosure against all defendants.  On November 9, 2015, the
Circuit Court entered its "Findings of Fact and Conclusions of
Law; Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and
for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure" (Foreclosure Decree ) and
accompanying "Judgment" ( Foreclosure Judgment ).  No party
appealed from the Foreclosure Judgment, and thus the Foreclosure
Judgment became final and binding as to U.S. Bank's right to
foreclosure on the subject property.  See Mortg. Elec.
Registration Sys., Inc. v. Wise, 130 Hawai# i 11, 17, 304 P.3d
1192, 1198 (2013).
On May 2, 2017, almost one and a half years after the
Foreclosure Judgment was entered, Arizumi filed "Defendant's
Motion for Relief from Judgment Pursuant to HRCP 60(b)(2), (3),
(4) and (6)" ( First HRCP Rule 60(b) Motion).  In the First HRCP
Rule 60(b) Motion, Arizumi argued, inter alia , that the Circuit
Court should set aside the Foreclosure Judgment because U.S. Bank
had failed to establish its standing.  On February 26, 2018, the
Circuit Court denied Arizumi's First HRCP Rule 60(b) Motion,
concluding in relevant part that U.S. Bank had established its
standing under Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai# i 361, 390 P.3d 1248
through its verified complaint.  There was no appeal from this
order. 
On October 1, 2018, U.S. Bank filed "Plaintiff's Motion
for Confirmation of Sale, Distribution of Proceeds, and for Writ
of Ejectment" ( Motion to Confirm Sale).   
On October 22, 2018, Arizumi filed "Defendant Brett C.
Arizumi's Renewed Motion for Relief From Judgment Pursuant to
HRCP Rule 60(b)(3) and (4), Based on Lack of Subject Matter
Standing Jurisdiction, Fraud on the Court, Supervening Authority,
and Violations of Due Process of Law" ( Renewed Rule 60(b)
Motion).  In his Renewed Rule 60(b) Motion, Arizumi continued to
challenge U.S. Bank's standing, asserting that the Circuit
Court's reliance on U.S. Bank's verified complaint was rejected
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
by this court in Klika.  Arizumi further argued that the Circuit
Court should set aside the Foreclosure Judgment because U.S. Bank
had obtained the mortgage through a void assignment, and because
U.S. Bank committed fraud on the court by placing the winning
credit bid on the subject property without informing the Court
that it no longer owned the mortgage when the auction was held.  
In support of the Renewed Rule 60(b) Motion, Arizumi attached
exhibits and purported to authenticate these exhibits through the
declaration of his counsel, Gary Dubin ( Dubin).  However, from
our review, Dubin's declaration fails to properly authenticate,
at a minimum, exhibits 7 and 10, upon which Arizumi rests his
contention that MERS did not have authority to assign the
mortgage on behalf of the original lender, New Century Mortgage
Corporation, and that U.S. Bank did not hold the mortgage when it
credit bid at auction.
On February 11, 2019, the Circuit Court entered its
Order Confirming Sale, Judgment Confirming Sale, and Order
Denying HRCP Rule 60(b) Motion.  This appeal follows.  
I. Arizumi's challenge to U.S. Bank's standing.
In his first point of error, Arizumi appears to assert
that the Circuit Court erred in entering both its Judgment
Confirming Sale and Order Denying HRCP Rule 60(b) Motion because
U.S. Bank failed to establish its standing under Reyes-Toledo,
139 Hawai#i 361, 390 P.3d 1248.  
In regard to Arizumi's first point of error, to the
extent it pertains to the Judgment Confirming Sale, the res
judicata effect of the Foreclosure Judgment, from which no party
appealed, precludes Arizumi from challenging U.S. Bank's standing
in his appeal of the Judgment Confirming Sale.  See Wise, 130
Hawai#i at 16-17, 304 P.3d at 1197-98.  As such, the Circuit
Court did not err in entering the Judgment Confirming Sale. 
Further, to the extent that Arizumi's first point of
error pertains to the Order Denying HRCP Rule 60(b) Motion, lack
of standing does not render a court's ruling void under HRCP Rule
60(b)(4).  "In the sound interest of finality, the concept of a
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
void judgment must be narrowly restricted."  Cvitanovich-Dubie v.
Dubie, 125 Hawai#i 128, 141, 254 P.3d 439, 452 (2011) (citations
and internal quotation marks omitted).  As such, "a judgment is
void only if the court that rendered it lacked jurisdiction of
either the subject matter or the parties or otherwise acted in a
manner inconsistent with due process of law."  Id. at 141, 254
P.3d at 452 (citation and footnote omitted).  As recently
reaffirmed by the Supreme Court of Hawai#i, "[i]n Hawai# i state
courts, standing is a prudential consideration . . . and is not
an issue of subject matter jurisdiction[.]"  Tax Found. of
Hawai#i v. State, 144 Hawai#i 175, 188, 439 P.3d 127, 140 (2019).
Here, Arizumi does not challenge the Circuit Court's
personal jurisdiction, and his argument that U.S. Bank lacks
standing is not equivalent to challenging a court's subject
matter jurisdiction.  Rather, this foreclosure action is "'in the
class of suits' that the [circuit] court 'has the general power
to adjudicate.'"  See Dubie, 125 Hawai# i at 142, 254 P.3d at 453
(citation omitted).  Thus, the Circuit Court did not err in
denying the Renewed Rule 60(b) Motion as it pertains to U.S.
Bank's standing in this foreclosure action.
II. Arizumi's remaining HRCP Rule 60(b) claims.
In his second point of error, Arizumi appears to assert
that the Foreclosure Judgment is void under HRCP Rule 60(b)(4)
because U.S. Bank was not validly assigned the subject mortgage
and note.  However, as previously stated, "a judgment is void
only if the court that rendered it lacked jurisdiction of either
the subject matter or the parties or otherwise acted in a manner
inconsistent with due process of law."  Id. at 141, 254 P.3d at
452 (citation and footnote omitted).  Arizumi's second point of
error does not support voiding the Foreclosure Judgment, but
instead is another effort to challenge U.S. Bank's standing,
which is barred by Arizumi's failure to appeal from the
Foreclosure Judgment.  See Wise, 130 Hawai# i at 16-17, 304 P.3d
at 1197-98.  The Circuit Court did not err in denying Arizumi's 
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Renewed Rule 60(b) Motion under HRCP Rule 60(b)(4) due to the
alleged defective assignment to U.S. Bank.
Finally, Arizumi asserts in his third point of error
that the Circuit Court erred in denying his Renewed Rule 60(b)
Motion because U.S. Bank committed "fraud on the court" by
placing a winning credit bid for the subject property when it
allegedly knew that it no longer owned the subject mortgage and
note at the time of the auction.  First, Arizumi's factual
contention, that U.S. Bank did not have rights under the mortgage
when it credit bid, was not supported by any properly admitted
evidence.  Moreover, as correctly noted by the Circuit Court in
its Order Denying HRCP Rule 60(b) Motion, Arizumi's argument was
untimely under HRCP Rule 60(b)(3) because relief on the grounds
of fraud must be made "not more than one year after the judgment,
order, or proceeding was entered or taken."  Arizumi
characterizes U.S. Bank's conduct as "fraud on the court". 
However, as explained by the Supreme Court of Hawai#i, "since the
remedy for fraud on the court is far reaching, it only applies to
very unusual cases involving far more than an injury to a single
litigant, but rather, a corruption of the judicial process
itself."  Dubie, 125 Hawai# i at 144, 254 P.3d at 455 (citations,
internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted).  Arizumi's claim
does not rise to the level of fraud on the court, and is properly
evaluated as alleged fraud under HRCP Rule 60(b)(3).  See id. at
145-46, 254 P.3d at 456-57.  Here, the Foreclosure Judgment from
which Arizumi sought relief was entered on November 9, 2015, and
Arizumi filed his Renewed Rule 60(b) Motion on October 22, 2018,
almost three years later.   The Circuit Court did not err in 2
2  In his reply brief, Arizumi asserts that his Renewed Rule 60(b)
Motion was timely under HRCP Rule 60(b)(3) because it was within one year of
the public auction, confirmation of sale hearing, and entry of the Judgment
Confirming Sale.  However, Arizumi's Renewed Rule 60(b) Motion was filed on
October 22, 2018, before the Judgment Confirming Sale was entered on February
11, 2019.  The Renewed Rule 60(b) Motion sought relief from the Foreclosure
Judgment, not the Judgment Confirming Sale.  His claim of fraud under HRCP
Rule 60(b)(3) was untimely.  
6NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
denying Arizumi's Renewed Rule 60(b) Motion under HRCP Rule
60(b)(3), as it was untimely. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the following, all
entered on February 11, 2019, by the Circuit Court of the First
Circuit, are affirmed:
(1) "Judgment"; 
(2) "Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Confirmation
of Sale, Distribution of Proceeds, and For Writ of Ejectment";
and
(3) "Order Denying Defendant Brett C. Arizumi's Renewed
Motion for Relief from Judgment Pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b)(3)
and (4), Based on Lack of Subject Matter Standing Jurisdiction,
Fraud on the Court, Supervening Authority, and Violations of Due
Process of Law".
