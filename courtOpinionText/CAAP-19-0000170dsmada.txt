IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
MID PAC PETROLEUM, LLC., Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
LANCE KAMUELA GOMES, Defendant-Appellant 
A
PPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 5RC-19-1-000130) 
ORDER GRANTING MARCH 14, 2019 MOTION TO
DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Reifurth, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of (1) Plaintiff-Appellee Mid Pac 
Petroleum, LLC's, (Mid Pac Petroleum) March 13, 2019 motion to 
dismiss appellate court case number CAAP-19-0000170 for lack of 
appellate jurisdiction, (2) the record, and (3) the lack of any 
memorandum by Defendant-Appellant Lance Kamuela Gomes (Gomes) in 
response to Mid Pac Petroleum's March 13, 2019 motion to dismiss, 
it appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction over Gomes's 
appeal from district court Civil No. 5RC-19-1-000130, the 
Honorable Michael K. Soong presiding, because the district court 
has not yet had an opportunity to adjudicate Plaintiff-Appellee 
Mid Pac Petroleum, LLC's, February 25, 2019 complaint. 
Gomes is appealing pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes 
(HRS) ยง 641-1(a) (2016). 
Pursuant to HRS ยง 641-1(a) (1993), appeals are allowed
in civil matters from all final judgments, orders, or
decrees of circuit and district courts. In district court cases, a judgment includes any order from which an appeal NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
lies. . . . A final order means an order ending the
proceeding, leaving nothing further to be accomplished. . . . When a written judgment, order, or decree ends thelitigation by fully deciding all rights and liabilities ofall parties, leaving nothing further to be adjudicated, thejudgment, order, or decree is final and appealable. 
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai# i 425, 426, 984 P.2d 1251, 
1252 (1999) (citations, internal quotation marks, and footnote 
omitted; emphases added). An appealable final order or final 
judgment in a district court case must be in writing. 
Rule 4(a)(5) of the Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure provides 
that "[a] judgment or order is entered when it is filed in the office of the clerk of the court." 
At the time when Gomes filed his March 13, 2019 notice 
of appeal, the district court had not entered any written order 
on any decision. 
Absent an appealable final order or final 
judgment, Gomes's appeal is premature, and we lack appellate jurisdiction. Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Mid Pac Petroleum's March 13, 
2019 motion to dismiss is granted, and appellate court case 
number CAAP-19-0000170 is dismissed for lack of appellate 
jurisdiction.
