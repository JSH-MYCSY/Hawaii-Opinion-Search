Smith raises a single point of error on appeal, 
contending that there was insufficient evidence to convict him 
where the credible evidence established that he did not act with the requisite intent to harass, annoy, or alarm the complaining witness (CW). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve Smith's point of error as follows: 
We conclude that when the evidence adduced at trial is 
considered in the strongest light for the prosecution, there was substantial evidence to convict Smith of Harassment. See State 
v. Matavale, 115 Hawai# i 149, 157-58, 166 P.3d 322, 330-31 
(2007). 
CW testified that Smith interrupted her conversation 
with a neighbor, at CW's house, with profanity-laced comments. After she told Smith to stop, he threw two chairs at her. CW then told Smith to leave, but he instead picked up a white chair. When CW attempted to grab the white chair, Smith would not release it and shoved the white chair into CW's leg causing a scratch and bleeding. Smith thereby subjected CW to offensive physical contact by shoving a chair into her leg causing a scratch and bleeding.

(a) Strikes, shoves, kicks, or otherwise touches
another person in an offensive manner or subjects
the other person to offensive physical contact[.]

Smith points to allegedly conflicting statements made 
by CW to argue that her testimony supporting Smith's requisite 
intent was not credible. However, as the Hawai# i appellate 
courts have often stated: 
Verdicts based on conflicting evidence will not be set aside
where there is substantial evidence to support the trier offact's findings. We have defined substantial evidence as credible evidence which is of sufficient quality andprobative value to enable a person of reasonable caution tosupport a conclusion. It is well-settled that an appellatecourt will not pass upon issues dependent upon thecredibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence;this is the province of the trier of fact. 
State v. Mattiello, 90 Hawai# i 255, 259, 978 P.2d 693, 697 (1999) 
(format altered). 
We conclude that, based on the testimonial and 
circumstantial evidence, and reasonable inferences arising from 
Smith's conduct, there was substantial evidence that Smith acted with intent to harass, annoy, or alarm CW, when he refused to stop his conduct, leave CW's residence, and when Smith picked up a white chair that eventually led to him shoving the white chair into CW. 
See State v. Stocker, 90 Hawai# i 85, 92, 976 P.2d 399, 
406 (1999). 
For these reasons, the District Court's January 28, 
2019 Judgment is affirmed.
