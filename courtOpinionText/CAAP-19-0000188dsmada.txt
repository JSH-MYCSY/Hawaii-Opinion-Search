APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 18-1-0125-01) 
ORDER GRANTING APRIL 12, 2019 MOTION TO
DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By:  Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Chan, JJ.) 
Upon review of (1) Defendant-Appellee Association of 
Apartment Owners of Mt. Terrace's (AOAO Mt. Terrace) April 12, 
2019 motion to dismiss appellate court case number CAAP-19-
0000188 for lack of appellate jurisdiction, (2) Plaintiffs-
Appellants Christina D. Cook, Bubby & Yuko, LLC, EJ Trosclair, 
Yuko Donley, Kari A. Thompson-Stueber and Jeremy E. Chellin's 
(the Appellants) April 19, 2019 memorandum in opposition to AOAO 
Mt. Terrace's April 12, 2019 motion, and (3) the record, it 
appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction over the Appellants' 
appeal from the Honorable Keith K. Hiraoka's 
• October 25, 2018 interlocutory order granting AOAO
Mt. Terrace's cross-motion for partial summaryjudgment on Count 1, Count 2 and Count 4 of theAppellants' four-count complaint, and NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
• October 25, 2018 interlocutory order denying the
Appellants' motion for partial summary judgment onCount 1 of the Appellants' four-count complaint, 
because the circuit court has neither adjudicated all of the 
claims nor reduced any of the substantive rulings to an 
appealable final judgment. 
An aggrieved party cannot obtain appellate review of a 
circuit court's dispositive orders in a civil case pursuant to 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a)(2016) until the circuit 
court reduces the dispositive rulings to an appealable final 
judgment pursuant to Rule 58 of the Hawai# i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP).  See Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai# i
 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994) ("An appeal may 
be taken from circuit court orders resolving claims against parties only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and 
the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the 
appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]").  "Thus, 
based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, 
even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has 
been reduced to a separate judgment."  Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 
119 Hawai# i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008).  Consequently, 
"[a]n appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the 
supreme court will be dismissed."  Jenkins, 76 Hawai# i at 120, 
869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote omitted).  On May 2, 2019, the circuit court clerk filed the record on appeal for CAAP-19-0000188, which 
does not include an appealable final judgment.  The two 
October 25, 2018 interlocutory orders are not independently 
appealable.  In the absence of an appealable final judgment, the 
Appellants' appeal is premature, and we lack appellate 
jurisdiction. 
The case is not eligible for temporary remand to the 
circuit court for supplementation of the record on appeal with an 
appealable final judgment as to all claims and parties under 
Waikiki v. Ho# omaka Village Ass'n of Apartment Owners, 140  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawai# i 197, 204, 398 P.3d 786, 793 (2017) because the circuit 
court has not yet adjudicated all of the multiple claims. 
Appellants filed a March 29, 2019 motion to certify 
some of the substantive rulings for an appeal pursuant to HRCP 
Rule 54(b) and urge this court to defer ruling on the motion to 
dismiss until the Rule 54(b) motion is ruled upon.  Not only does 
the record here lack any indication that the circuit court 
intends to certify the two October 25, 2018 orders for an appeal 
pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b), but on April 30, 2019, the circuit 
court announced in minutes that it intended to deny the 
Appellants' March 29, 2019 motion for HRCP Rule 54(b)-
certification of the two October 25, 2018 orders.  Therefore, we 
decline to defer for any further ruling on the instant motion.  A 
temporary remand would be inappropriate and unauthorized under 
HRS § 602-57(3) and the holding in Waikiki. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that AOAO Mt. Terrace's 
April 12, 2019 motion to dismiss CAAP-19-0000188 is granted, and 
the case is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are 
dismissed as moot.
