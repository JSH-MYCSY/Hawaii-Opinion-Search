IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
BRADLEY D. PAI, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 3CPC-18-0000976) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By:  Reifurth, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Upon review of the electronic pleadings record for the 
underlying case in circuit court criminal court case number 3CPC-
18-0000976, it appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction over 
this appeal in appellate court case number CAAP-19-0000206 by 
Defendant-Appellant Bradley Pai (Pai), pro se, from the Honorable 
Melvin Fujino's March 11, 2019 bench warrant under Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS) § 641-11 (2016) in the absence of either a 
judgment of conviction with a sentence or a final order of 
dismissal without prejudice. 
"The right of appeal in a criminal case is purely 
statutory[.]"  State v. Nicol, 140 Hawai# i 482, 485, 403 P.3d 
259, 262 (2017) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The law that allows appeals from circuit court criminal cases is 
HRS § 641-11, which provides that "[a]ny party aggrieved by the 
judgment of a circuit court in a criminal matter may appeal to 
the intermediate appellate court, subject to chapter 602, in the 
manner and within the time provided by the rules of court.  The  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
sentence of the court in a criminal case shall be the judgment." 
Thus, "[u]nder HRS § 641-11, the sentence of the court in a 
criminal case is the judgment from which an appeal is 
authorized[,]" and where "[t]here [is] no conviction and sentence 
in . . . [a] case, there can be no appeal under HRS § 641-11[.]" 
State v. Kealaiki, 95 Hawai# i 309, 312, 22 P.3d 588, 591 (2001) 
(internal quotation marks and citations omitted); State v. Johnston, 63 Haw. 9, 11, 619 P.2d 1076, 1077 (1980) (Dismissing 
an appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction where a defendant 
had filed a notice of appeal from an order denying the 
defendant's motion to dismiss an indictment, even though the 
circuit court later entered a judgment with a sentence, because 
"such an order is interlocutory and is not a final order or 
judgment.  It is therefore not one that is appealable under HRS 
§ 641-11."); State v. Ferreira, 54 Haw. 485, 486-87, 510 P.2d 88, 
89 (1973) (Dismissing an appeal from a "judgment of conviction 
[that] does not include any sentence imposed upon the 
defendant[.]").  In determining whether an order or judgment 
qualifies for appealability under HRS § 641-11, the Supreme Court 
of Hawai# i
 has "focused the inquiry on whether the relevant order 
terminated the proceedings in the case and left nothing further to be accomplished by the lower court."  Nicol, 140 Hawai# i at 
492, 403 P.3d at 269.  Consequently, in addition to authorizing an appeal from a judgment with a sentence, "HRS § 641-11 
authorizes a defendant's appeal in a criminal matter from a 
circuit court order dismissing the proceedings without 
prejudice."  Id. at 494, 403 P.3d at 271 (footnote omitted). 
In the instant case, the circuit court has neither 
entered judgment on nor dismissed Plaintiff-Appellee State of 
Hawaii's four charged crimes of 
(1) harassment in violation of HRS § 711-1106 (2014), 
(2) disorderly conduct in violation of HRS § 711-1101
(2014), 
(3) resisting arrest in violation of HRS § 710-1026(2014), and 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(4) criminal contempt of court in violation of HRS
§ 710-1077 (2014 & Supp. 2018). 
In the absence of either a judgment of conviction with a sentence 
or an order dismissing the four charge crimes without prejudice, 
leaving nothing further to be accomplished, the March 11, 2019 
bench warrant is not yet eligible for appellate review.  Pai's 
appeal from the ongoing proceedings is premature, and we lack 
appellate jurisdiction. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED appellate court case 
number CAAP-19-0000206 is dismissed for lack of appellate 
jurisdiction.
