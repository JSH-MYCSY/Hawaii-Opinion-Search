Esprecion (the Nieces) over who would succeed to Mervin's lease. 
After a contested case hearing the Hawaiian Homes Commission
ordered Mervin's lease transferred to Nieces, retroactive to
June 26, 2012.  Emma appealed.  The circuit court affirmed.  Emmafiled a secondary appeal.  We affirmed.  Meyers v. Hawaiian Homes
Comm'n, No. CAAP-18-0000801, 2023 WL 4636728 (Haw. App. July 20,
2023) (mem.) ( Meyers I ).
Nieces filed the complaint below against the Meyerses
on December 9, 2016.  The complaint alleged that Nieces were DHHLlessees; they acquired their interests from Mervin by order ofthe Commission; and the Meyerses lived on their property andrefused to vacate.  Nieces sought, among other things, a writ ofejectment.  Nieces moved for partial summary judgment and a writof ejectment.  The Order and Writ were entered on March 1, 2019. This appeal followed.
The Meyerses argue that the Commission erred by
ordering that Nieces succeed to Mervin's lease.  Emma, who was aparty in Meyers I
, and Bushrod, who is in privity with Emma, are
precluded from challenging the Commission's Order.  Bremer v.
