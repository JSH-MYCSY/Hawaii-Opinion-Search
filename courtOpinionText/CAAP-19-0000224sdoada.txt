IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI#I 
KAHALA BEACH ASSOCIATION OF APARTMENT OWNERS,
Plaintiff/Lessee-Appellant,
v. 
KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS,
Defendant/Lessor-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(S.P. NO. 18-1-0444) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, and Wadsworth and Nakasone, JJ.) 
This appeal stems from a dispute concerning an 
arbitration award, which resolved a lease rent dispute between 
Defendant/Lessor-Appellee Kamehameha Schools (
KS), as lessor, and 
Plaintiff/Lessee-Appellant The Kahala Beach Association of Apartment Owners (KBA), as the representative of the lessees 
under a set of apartment leases (Apartment Leases). KBA appeals 
from the "Order Denying [KBA's] Motion To Vacate Arbitration 
Award Filed December 4, 2018 and Confirming Award" (Order), 
entered on February 22, 2019, in the Circuit Court of the First 
Circuit (Circuit Court).
1/ The Order confirmed a September 4, 
2018 arbitration award (Award), under which three appraisers (the
Panel) appointed pursuant to the Apartment Leases determined "the 
total rental value, as of July 16, 2017, of the land comprising 
the site of the [Kahala Beach condominium p]roject . . . ." 
1/ The Honorable Dean E. Ochiai presided.   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
On appeal, KBA contends that the Circuit Court erred 
in: (1) failing to vacate the Award, where "the appraisers 
plainly exceeded the limited authority delegated to them by the [p]arties"; and (2) applying a deferential standard of review to the Award, which "was predicated on matters outside of the appraisers' scope of power[.]" 
After reviewing the record on appeal and the relevant 
legal authorities, and giving due consideration to the issues raised and the arguments advanced by the parties, we resolve KBA's contentions as follows, and affirm. 
KBA contends that the Circuit Court should have vacated 
the Award, because the Panel exceeded its powers as set forth in the appraisal provision in the Apartment Leases (Appraisal
Provision). The Appraisal Provision states in relevant part: 
A. Appraisal. Whenever this lease provides that the
total rental value of said land comprising the site of the
project shall be determined by appraisal for computation ofany rent hereunder, such rental value shall be equal to sixpercent (6%) of the then market value for multifamilyresidential purposes of said land, exclusive of allimprovements thereon, as shall be determined by threeimpartial real estate appraisers . . . and the threeappraisers so appointed shall proceed to determine thematters in question, and the decision of said appraisers ora majority of them shall be final, conclusive and binding onboth parties hereto . . . . 
KBA argues that the Panel's power under this provision was 
"exceedingly limited" – that the Panel was to determine the value of the land at issue, based on the parameters specified in the Apartment Leases, including use restrictions and encumbrances, and that when those parameters became an issue, it was for the court and not the panel to decide "what" the Parties intended to be valued.
2/ 
KS, on the other hand, contends that the Panel did not 
exceed its powers. KS argues that the dispute that arose over the interpretation of the Appraisal Provision, i.e, whether the Panel was to determine the "market value" of the "land" encumbered (or unencumbered) by the Apartment Leases, fell within 
2/ KBA further asserts that the Panel exceeded its powers by
determining "what" was to be valued, and in doing so ignored the encumbrances
that run with the land, including a four-story building limitation. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
the scope of the parties' agreement to arbitrate. In making this 
argument, KS relies primarily on two cases, Ching v. Hawaiian Rests., Ltd., 50 Haw. 563, 445 P.2d 370 (1968), and Oahuan, Ltd. v. Trs. of The Violet K. Maertens Tr. Estate, 4 Haw. App. 295, 666 P.2d 603 (App. 1983). 
There is no dispute in this case that the Appraisal 
Provision constitutes a valid agreement to arbitrate under 
Hawai#i law, and that the Panel issued an arbitration award. See 
Loyalty Dev. Co. v. Wholesale Motors, Inc.
, 61 Haw. 483, 487-88, 
605 P.2d 925, 928 (1980); Ching, 50 Haw. at 565, 445 P.2d at 372. The following standards of review apply where a party challenges an arbitration award: 
First, because of the legislative policy to encourage
arbitration and thereby discourage litigation, arbitratorshave broad discretion in resolving the dispute. Uponsubmission of an issue, the arbitrator has authority todetermine the entire question, including the legalconstruction of terms of a contract or lease, as well as thedisputed facts. In fact, where the parties agree toarbitrate, they thereby assume all the hazards of thearbitration process, including the risk that the arbitratorsmay make mistakes in the application of law and in theirfindings of fact. 
Second, correlatively, judicial review of an arbitration
award is confined to the strictest possible limits. An arbitration award may be vacated only on the four groundsspecified in [Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS)] § 658–9 and
modified and corrected only on the three grounds specifiedin HRS § 658–10. Moreover, the courts have no businessweighing the merits of the award. 
Third, HRS §§ 658–9 and –10 also restrict the authority of
appellate courts to review judgments entered by circuitcourts confirming or vacating the arbitration awards. 
Nordic PCL Const., Inc. v. LPIHGC, LLC , 136 Hawai#i 29, 41, 358 
P.3d 1, 13 (2015) (quoting 
Daiichi Hawaii Real Estate Corp. v. 
Lichter
, 103 Hawai#i 325, 336, 82 P.3d 411, 422 (2003)). 
Settled case law is dispositive here. 
In Ching, 
appraisers were appointed to determine the fair market value of 
leased premises in order to set annual rent. Id. at 564, 445 
P.2d at 371. The lease provided that the appraisers' decision would be "final, conclusive and binding on both parties[.]" Id. 
at 564 n.1, 445 P.2d at 371 n.1. When the appraisers could not agree, the lessee brought suit for a declaratory judgment interpreting the words "fair market value." Id. at 565, 445 P.2d 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
at 371. The circuit court denied the lessor's request to require 
arbitration of the dispute and "ruled that the words 'fair market value' of the demised land as used in the lease meant fair market value of the land at its highest and best use, unencumbered by the lease." Id.On appeal, the Hawai# i Supreme Court held that 
under the appraisal provision in the lease, "the parties . . . intended to provide for and contemplated arbitration on the question of rental when there was a disagreement." Id. at 566, 
445 P.2d at 372. The court further held that "[t]hus, the trial judge should have submitted the entire question of rental to arbitration, including the interpretation of the term 'fair market value.'" Id. 
In Oahuan, this court applied the holding in Ching to a 
dispute over the confirmation of an arbitration award setting the lease rent payable by the lessee. See 4 Haw. App. at 302, 666 
P.2d at 608. There, the lessors challenged the award, arguing in part that the arbitrators "exceeded their powers" in disregarding the words "excluding improvements" and "exclusive of improvements" in the lease's appraisal provision. Id. at 299, 
666 P.2d at 606. This court rejected that argument and held: 
[O]nce the determination of the "fair and reasonable market
value" of the land "exclusive of improvements" was submittedfor arbitration, the entire question, including theinterpretation of the terms "exclusive of improvements" and"excluding improvements," was to be determined by [thearbitrators] . . . . The arbitrators in good faith did notexceed or imperfectly execute their powers or make an awardupon a matter not submitted to them. 
Id. at 302, 666 P.2d at 608 (1983) (citing Ching). 
Similarly, here, the Appraisal Provision in the 
Apartment Leases states that the rental value to be determined by 
the appraisers "shall be equal to six percent (6%) of the then market value for multifamily residential purposes of said land, exclusive of improvements thereon . . . ." This determination was submitted to the Panel. KBA now argues, in essence, that the Panel was not empowered to interpret the terms of the Appraisal Provision, and when it did so, it improperly "ignored" the encumbrances that run with the land. "When an issue is submitted [to arbitration], the entire question, including the legal 
4  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
construction of terms in a contract or lease, is to be determined 
by the arbitrator." Oahuan, 4 Haw. App. at 298, 666 P.2d at 606. 
Based on the holdings in Ching and Oahuan, once the parties submitted for arbitration the determination of the rental value of the land as specified in the Appraisal Provision, the interpretation of that provision's terms was within the Panel's powers. 
KBA argues that "Ching is not persuasive because it 
does not address issues related to the scope of the appraiser's power[,]" and "Oahuan is distinguishable because it is older and was decided in a lower court than Koolau[ Radiology, Inc. v. Queen's Med. Ctr., 73 Haw. 433, 834 P.2d 1294 (1992)] . . . " 
These arguments are unavailing. In Ching, the supreme court 
expressly held that "the trial judge should have submitted the entire question of rental to arbitration, including the interpretation of the term 'fair market value.'" 50 Haw. at 566, 445 P.2d at 372. Morever, Oahuan is still good law. It was not overruled, criticized, or even mentioned in Koolau Radiology, which held that an arbitration clause mandating the appointment of a real estate appraiser to determine lease values did not empower the appraiser to arbitrate a separate issue involving the validity of an alleged oral agreement modifying the written lease. 73 Haw. at 447, 834 P.2d at 1301. The scope of the arbitration agreement in Koolau Radiology was at issue in a way that it is not here.
3/ 
Accordingly, we conclude that the Panel did not exceed 
its powers under the Arbitration Provision, and thus its authority within the meaning of HRS § 658A-23(a)(4), and the Circuit Court did not err in denying KBA's December 4, 2018 motion to vacate the Award. We further conclude that the Circuit 
3/ Brennan v. Stewarts' Pharmacies, Ltd., 59 Haw. 207, 579 P.2d 673
(1978), which KBA characterizes as "directly on-point," is also inapposite.
In Brennan, the parties submitted for arbitration the "limited question" ofthe "fair monthly rental" of a shopping center space during the second ten-year period of a 20-year lease. Id. at 222, 579 P.2d at 682. Given the 
limited nature of the submitted question, the court held that the arbitratorsclearly exceeded their powers by construing the meaning of various provisionsin the lease agreement. Id.Here, in contrast, when the parties submitted
for arbitration the determination of the rental value of the land as specifiedin the Appraisal Provision, the interpretation of that provision's terms waswithin the Panel's powers under Ching and Oahuan.

Court did not err in reviewing the Award with deference. See 
Tatibouet v. Ellsworth, 99 Hawai# i 226, 233, 54 P.3d 397, 404 
(2002); Nordic PCL Const., 136 Hawai
#i at 41, 358 P.3d at 13. 
For the reasons discussed above, we affirm the "Order 
Denying Plaintiff's Motion To Vacate Arbitration Award Filed December 4, 2018 and Confirming Award," entered on February 22, 2019, in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit.
