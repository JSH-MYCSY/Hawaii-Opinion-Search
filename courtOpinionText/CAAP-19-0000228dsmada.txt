NO. CAAP-19-0000228
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI#I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
BRADLEY PAI, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
NORTH AND SOUTH KONA DIVISION
(CASE NO. 3DTA-18-02847)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.)
Upon review of the record in appellate court case
number CAAP-19-0000228, it appears that we lack appellate
jurisdiction pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-
12(a) (2016).  In this appeal, Defendant-Appellant Bradley
Dean M. Pai (Pai), self-represented, appears to be appealing from
the Honorable Margaret K. Masunaga's February 22, 2019
interlocutory order directing Pai to fill out a form for the
Office of the Public Defender and return to court on March 18,
2019, for a pre-trial conference in district court criminal case
number 3DTA-17-02487.  At that time, the district court had not
yet held a trial on Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawaii's (the
State) August 15, 2017 complaint against Pai for:NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(1)operating a vehicle under the influence of an
intoxicant in violation of HRS § 291E-61 (Supp.
2018),
(2)operating a motor vehicle without a valid license
in violation of HRS § 286-102 (2007 & Supp. 2018),
and 
(3)operating a motor vehicle without proof of
liability insurance in violation of HRS § 431:10C-
104 (2005).
The February 22, 2019 interlocutory order is not an independently
appealable final order under HRS § 641-12(a), and thus the
dismissal of this appeal is warranted.
"The right of appeal in a criminal case is purely
statutory[.]"  State v. Nicol, 140 Hawai#i 482, 485, 403 P.3d
259, 262 (2017) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
The Hawai#i Intermediate Court of Appeals has jurisdiction "[t]o
hear and determine appeals from any court or agency when appeals
are allowed by law[.]"  HRS § 602-57(1) (2016).  HRS § 641-12(a)
provides that "[a]ppeals upon the record shall be allowed from
all final decisions and final judgments of district courts in all
criminal matters."  In order to perfect a defendant's right to
appeal from a district court criminal case pursuant to HRS § 641-
12(a), the district court must enter either a judgment of
conviction with a complete sentence, or an order dismissing the
complaint without prejudice, thereby terminating the proceedings
and leaving nothing further for the district court to accomplish. 
State v. Kilborn, 109 Hawai# i 435, 442, 127 P.3d 95, 102 (App.
2005) (regarding the appealability of a district court judgment
of conviction and sentence under HRS § 641-12); Nicol, 140
Hawai#i at 491, 403 P.3d at 268 (explaining that "under the
Hawaii Revised Statutes, district court defendants . . . in . . .
district . . . court may appeal from an order dismissing
proceedings without prejudice.") (citations omitted)).  At the
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
time Pai filed his March 21, 2019 notice of appeal,  the district
court had not yet announced or entered any final appealable
decision or order.1
On April 15, 2019, the district court did enter a
judgment dismissing the State's case without prejudice, which was
an appealable final judgment under the holding in Nicol, and,
Rule 4(b)(4) of the Hawai#i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP)
provides that "[a] notice of appeal filed after the announcement
of a decision, sentence or order but before entry of the judgment
or order shall be deemed to have been filed on the date such
judgment or order is entered."  (Emphasis added.)  Nevertheless,
at the time Pai filed his March 21, 2019 notice of appeal from
the February 22, 2019 interlocutory order, the district court had
not yet announced the dismissal of the underlying case.  In order
for a defendant to invoke HRAP Rule 4(b)(4) for a premature
notice of appeal, at the time the defendant files the premature
notice of appeal, the trial court must have already announced a
decision, sentence or order that will be appealable and final
when the trial court reduces that announcement to a written
judgment or written order.
The Supreme Court of Hawai#i held that, where a party
filed his notice of appeal before the trial court's announcement
of its final decision, that premature notice of appeal was a
legal nullity that had no legal effect with respect to the
written appealable final order that the trial court later
entered.  Grattafiori v. State, 79 Hawai#i 10, 13-14, 897 P.2d
937, 940-41 (1995).
In the instant case, Pai filed his March 21, 2019
notice of appeal before the district court orally announced any
1  It appears Pai submitted his Notice of Appeal to the district court
on March 21, 2019.  It was then electronically file-stamped on March 22, 2019. 
Thus, it appears the effective date is March 21, 2019.

final decision that could be appealable.  Therefore, we lack
jurisdiction regarding this appeal.
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number
CAAP-19-0000228 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
