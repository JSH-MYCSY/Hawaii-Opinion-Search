IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI#I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
BRADLEY PAI, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
NORTH AND SOUTH KONA DIVISION
(CASE NO. 3DTA-18-02847)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.)
Upon review of the record in appellate court case
number CAAP-19-0000229, it appears that we lack appellate
jurisdiction pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-
12(a) (2016).  In this appeal, Defendant-Appellant Bradley Dean
M. Pai (Pai), self-represented, appears to be appealing from the
Honorable Margaret K. Masunaga's February 22, 2019 interlocutory
order directing Pai to fill out a form for the Office of the
Public Defender and return to court on March 18, 2019, for a pre-
trial conference in district court criminal case number 3DTA-18-
02847.  At that time, the district court had not yet held a trial
on Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawaii's (the State) October 2,
2018 complaint against Pai for criminal contempt of court in
violation of HRS § 710-1077 (2014 & Supp. 2018).  The
February 22, 2019 interlocutory order is not an independently
appealable final order under HRS § 641-12(a), and, thus the
dismissal of this appeal is warranted.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
"The right of appeal in a criminal case is purely
statutory[.]"  State v. Nicol, 140 Hawai#i 482, 485, 403 P.3d
259, 262 (2017) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
The Hawai# i Intermediate Court of Appeals has jurisdiction "[t]o
hear and determine appeals from any court or agency when appeals
are allowed by law[.]"  HRS § 602-57(1) (2016).  HRS § 641-12(a)
provides that "[a]ppeals upon the record shall be allowed from
all final decisions and final judgments of district courts in all
criminal matters."  Consequently, "in order to appeal a criminal
matter in the district court, the appealing party must appeal
from a written judgment or order that has been filed with the
clerk of the court pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(b)(3)."  State v.
Bohannon, 102 Hawai# i 228, 236, 74 P.3d 980, 988 (2003); see also
Rule 32(c)(2) of the Hawai# i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP).  In
order to perfect a defendant's right to appeal from a district
court criminal case pursuant to HRS § 641-12(a), the district
court must enter either a judgment of conviction with a complete
sentence, or an order dismissing the complaint without prejudice,
thereby terminating the proceedings and leaving nothing further
for the district court to accomplish.  State v. Kilborn, 109
Hawai#i 435, 442, 127 P.3d 95, 102 (App. 2005) (regarding the
appealability of a district court judgment of conviction and
sentence under HRS § 641-12); Nicol, 140 Hawai#i at 491, 403 P.3d
at 268 (Explaining that "under the Hawaii Revised Statutes,
district court defendants . . . in . . . district . . . court may
appeal from an order dismissing proceedings without prejudice." 
(Citations omitted)).  At the time when Pai filed his March 21,
2019 notice of appeal, the district court had not yet announced
any final decision.
On April 15, 2019, the district court did enter a
judgment dismissing the State's case without prejudice, which was
an appealable final judgment under the holding in Nicol, and
further, Rule 4(b)(4) of the Hawai#i Rules of Appellate Procedure
(HRAP) provides that "[a] notice of appeal filed after the
announcement of a decision, sentence or order but before entry of
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
the judgment or order shall be deemed to have been filed on the
date such judgment or order is entered."  (Emphasis added). 
Nevertheless, at the time when Pai filed his March 21, 2019
notice of appeal from the February 22, 2019 interlocutory order,
the district court had not yet announced the dismissal of the
underlying case.  In order for a defendant to invoke HRAP Rule
4(b)(4) for a premature notice of appeal, at the time when the
defendant files the premature notice of appeal, the trial court
must have already announced a decision, sentence or order that
will be appealable and final when the trial court reduces that
announcement to a written judgment or written order.
The Supreme Court of Hawai#i held that, where a party
filed his notice of appeal before the trial court's announcement
of its final decision, that premature notice of appeal was a
legal nullity that had no legal effect with respect to the
written appealable final order that the trial court later
entered.  Grattafiori v. State, 79 Hawai#i 10, 13-14, 897 P.2d
937, 940-41 (1995).
In the instant case, Pai filed his March 21, 2019
notice of appeal before the district court orally announced any
final decision that could be appealable.  Therefore, we are
without jurisdiction to address the merits of Pai's appeal.
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number
CAAP-19-0000229 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, March 5, 2020.
