 In April 2018, Nolen was charged by indictment with 
one count of  Sexual Assault in the Third Degree, in violation of  
Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 707-732(1)(b) ( 2014), and one 
count of Attempted Kidnapping,  in violation of  HRS §§ 705 -500 
(2014) and 707-720(1)(d)  (2014).  A jury found Nolen guilty as 
charged in December 2018.     
Nolen argues four points of error on appeal.  He 
contends  that the circuit court erred  in: (1) "[d]enying [his] 
Motion to Dismiss for Violation of [Hawai ʻi Rules of Penal 
Procedure ( HRPP)] Rule 48" ;2 (2) "[a]dmitting Evidence of Nolen's 
Cell Phone which was Attached to the Peephole of his Door"; (3) 
determining "there was Sufficient Evidence to Conclude that 
Nolen Attempted to Kidnap [the complaining witness (CW)]"; and 
(4) "not Engag[ing] in a Proper [Tachibana ] Colloquy with Nolen 
Regarding his Waiver of his Right to Testify or to not Testify."    
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve Nolen's 
points of error as follows:  
(1) Nolen asserts the violation of his right to a 
speedy trial under HRPP Rule 48.   We review the circuit court's 
findings of fact in deciding an HRPP Rule 48 motion to dismiss 
 
2  As part of point of error (1), Nolen raises an ineffective 
assistance of counsel claim.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 for clear error.  State v. Choy Foo , 142 Hawai ʻi 65, 72, 414 P.3d 
117, 124 (2018).   "[W]hether those facts fall within HRPP 
48(b)'s exclusionary provisions is a question of law, the 
determination of which is freely reviewable pursuant to the 
'right/wrong' test."  State v. Hernane , 145 Hawai ʻi 444, 449, 
454 P.3d 385, 390 (2019)  (citation omitted) .   
At the May 29, 2018 trial call, Nolen's trial counsel 
stipulated with the State  of Hawai ʻi (State) to a continuance of 
the trial.3  His counsel represented to the court that, "[m]y 
client is anxious to exercise his speedy trial rights, but at 
this point I've told him that I am –- I do need to prepare if he 
–- if he's going to go to trial."  The circuit court explained 
to Nolen that "there's a transcript involving the interview of 
the complainant that [your counsel] needs to have so she can 
prepare for your case in the event your case goes to trial,  and 
asked Nolen if he agreed to "waive [his] right to Rule 48 and 
speedy trial."  Nolen responded, "I will not."   The circuit 
court continued the trial week to September 17, 2018, over 
Nolen's objection  as follows,  
THE COURT: Okay.  Well, that's fine, it's on the 
record.  Your attorney, however, must do what she has to do 
in order for her to prepare to –- 
 
THE DEFENDANT: I understand.  
 
 
3  Nolen's trial counsel at the time was Deputy Public Defender 
Doris Lum .  Lum moved to withdraw as counsel in September 2018 , and the 
circuit court subsequently appointed attorney Emmanuel G. Guerrero to 
represent Nolen . NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
4 
 THE COURT: -- represent you, and it is her 
responsibility.  
 
The record reflects that Nolen's counsel agreed to 
continue the trial, while Nolen himself objected to the 
continuance .  At issue  is whether Nolen's counsel's agreement to 
the continuance violated  Nolen's right, pursuant to HRPP 
Rule 48,4 to a speedy trial.  HRPP Rule 48 excludes from the 
computation of time "periods that delay the commencement of 
trial and are caused by a continuance granted at the request or 
with the consent of the defendant or defendant's counsel [.]"  
HRPP Rule 48(c)(3)  (emphasis added) .   
Pursuant to well -established Hawai ʻi case law, "HRPP 
Rule 48 is intended to ensure an accused a speedy trial, which 
is separate and distinct from [the] constitutional protection to 
a speedy trial."  State v. Fukuoka , 141 Haw aiʻi 48, 55, 404 P.3d 
314, 321 (2017) (cleaned up).  In State v. Diaz , 100 Haw aiʻi 210, 
223, 58 P.3d 1257 , 1270 (2002), the Hawai ʻi Supreme Court 
recognized that HRPP Rule 48 "only requires consent from either 
the defendant or the defendant's counsel. "  Id. at 223, 58 P.3d 
at 1270 (emphasis added).   
 
4  Nolen specifically contends on appeal that his right to a speedy 
trial pursuant to HRPP Rule 48 was violated.  He does not contend a violation 
of his constitutional right to speedy trial.  We address only the HRPP 
Rule 48 claim that Nolen raises.   Hawaiʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure 
Rule 28(b)(7) ("Points not argued may be deemed waived.").  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
5 
 Applying this precedent , we determine that the circuit 
court was not wrong in concluding Nolen's counsel validly agreed 
to a continuance of trial, pursuant to HRPP Rule 48, on the 
basis that counsel required additional time to obtain and review  
transcript s in preparation for trial.   
We further determine that the record is not 
sufficiently developed for this court to address Nolen's claim 
that his counsel provided ineffective assistance by agreeing to 
continue trial over his objection.  State v. Silva , 75 Haw. 419, 
439, 864 P.2d 583, 592 (1993) ("[N]ot every trial record is 
sufficiently developed to determine whether there has been 
ineffective assistance of counsel; indeed, a defendant is often 
only able to allege facts that, if proved, would entitle him or 
her to relief.").  
We thus affirm the Judgment without prejudice to 
Nolen's filing of a petition for post -conviction relief, 
pursuant to HRPP Rule 40, to allow for the development of a 
factual record as to those contentions of ineffective assistance  
of counsel .   
(2) Nolen contends that the circuit court erred in 
admitting evidence that his cell phone was attached to the 
peephole of his apartment  door.  Nolen contends that the 
admitted cell phone evidence was both irrelevant, under Hawaii 
Rules of Evidence ( HRE) Rules 401 and 402  (2016), and more NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 prejudicial than probative , under HRE Rule 403.   We review the 
circuit court's determination of relevance under the right/wrong 
standard.   State v. Cordeiro , 99 Hawai ʻi 390, 404, 56 P.3d 692, 
706 (2002 ).  We review the circuit court's determination that 
relevant evidence was more probative than prejudicial, pursuant 
to HRE Rule 403, for abuse of discretion.  Id.   
HRE Rule 401 defines "relevant evidence" as "evidence 
having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of 
consequence to the determination of the action more probable or 
less probable than it would be without the evidence."5    
Relevant evidence can include e vidence of a defendant's 
"consciousness of guilt ."  See Territory v. Corum , 34 Haw. 167, 
189 (Haw. Terr. 1937) (Quoting 1 Wigmore on Evidence § 173, p. 
224, for the proposition that, "[a] criminal act leaves usually 
on the mind a deep trace, in the shape of a consciousness of 
guilt, and from this consciousness of guilt we may argue to the 
doing of the deed by the bearer of the trace ."); see also  
Cordeiro , 99 Hawai ʻi at 412, 56 P.3d at 714 ( Quoting Mitchell v. 
State, 982 P.2d 7 17, 723 (Wyo. 1999), for the proposition that 
"[a] defendant's activity after committing a crime in an attempt 
to evade detection is relevant circumstantial evidence of 
guilt.") (cleaned up).  We conclude that the circuit court was 
 
5  HRE Rule 402 states, in pertinent part, that "[e]vidence which is 
not relevant is not admissible."    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
7 
 not wrong in determining that the evidence of the cell phone 
attached to Nolen's door was relevant to the question of Nolen's 
consciousness of guilt .   
HRE Rule 403 requires the circuit court to balance 
whether the probative value of relevant evidence would be 
"substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, 
confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by 
considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless 
presentation of cumulative evidence."  The record reflects that 
the cell phone evidence was probative to establish ing that Nolen 
had positioned the cell phone to the peephole of his door to see 
who was approaching.   On this recor d, we determine that the 
circuit court did not abuse its discretion in concluding  that 
the cell phone evidence was more probative than prejudicial with 
respect to the State's argument of Nolen's consciousness of 
guilt.   
The circuit court did not err in admitting the cell 
phone evidence at trial.   
(3) Nolen contends that , because Hawai ʻi's Attempt ed 
Kidnapping statute does not include an element specifying a 
temporal duration of restraint, Nolen should have been charged 
with Kidnapping  rather than Attempted Kidnapping.   Nolen sets 
forth his argument as follows, "[h]ere, since [Nolen's]  actions 
constituted a prohibited 'restraint,' all the elements for a NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
8 
 charge of kidnapping have been satisfied.  However, the State 
did not charge [Nolen] with kidnapping but rather the charge of 
attempted kidnapping.  Accordingly, there was insufficient 
evidence to support the attempt ed kidnapping charge."  We 
disagree.  
HRS § 707 -720(1)(d) provides that "[a] person commits 
the offense of kidnapping if the person intentionally or 
knowingly restrains another person with intent to . . . 
[i]nflict bodily injury upon that person or subject that person 
to a sexual offense[.] "  Pursuant to HRS § 705 -500(1)(b), "[a] 
person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime" if that person 
"[i]ntentionally engages in conduct which, under the 
circumstances as the person believes them to be, constitutes a 
substantial step in a course of con duct intended to culminate in 
the person's commission of the crime."   
CW testified at trial that, while CW was playing a 
motorcycle game, a man "poked [her] butt" with his finger.   She 
further testified that, while she was about to play the Lost 
Land Adventure game, "[s]omeone tried to pick me up" " [w]ith his 
hands."  She testified that the person "picked me up through the 
legs" touching " [m]y crotch[,]" at which time she "donkey kicked 
him" by "[throwing her ] leg back."   At that point, the person  
"dropped [her ]."  CW testified that she was "[s]cared" 
"[b]ecause I thought he' d take me."   We find the above evidence NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
9 
 sufficient to support the jury's finding that Nolen took a 
"substantial step" towards "intentionally or knowingly 
restrain[ing]" CW, "with intent to . . . [i]nflict bodily injury 
upon that person or subject that person to a sexual offense[.]"  
HRS § 707 -720(1)(d).  
We conclude that the record contains sufficient 
evidence to support the jury's conviction for Attempted 
Kidnapping.     
(4) Nolen contends that he was denied a " Proper 
[Tachibana ] Colloquy" because the circuit court "obtained the 
waiver and then advised [Nolen] of his right to testify[. ]"  
(Emphasis in original).  We review the validity of a defendant's 
waiver in a criminal case of the right to testify under the 
right/wrong standard.  State v. Celestine , 142 Hawai ʻi 165, 169, 
415 P.3d 907, 911 (2018).   
"[I]n order to protect the right to testify under the 
Hawaiʻi Constitution, trial courts must advise criminal 
defendants of their right to testify and must obtain an on -the-
record waiver of that right in every case in which the defendant 
does not testify."  Tachibana v. State , 79 Hawai ʻi 226, 236, 900 
P.2d 1293, 1303 (1995)  (footnote omitted) .  The Hawai ʻi Supreme 
Court has instructed that the required elements of the 
advisement,  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
10 
 consist of informing the defendant (1) that they have a 
right to testify, (2) that if they want to testify, no one 
can prevent them from doing so, and (3) that if they 
testify, the prosecution will be allowed to cross -examine 
them. . . . [ I]n connection with the privilege against 
self-incrimination, t he defendant should also be advised 
(4) that they have a right not to testify and (5) that if 
they do not testify, then the jury can be instructed about 
that right.    
 
State v. Martin , 146 Hawai ʻi 365, 378, 463 P.3d 1022, 1035 (2020)  
(citation omitted) .    
The record reflects that the circuit court engaged 
Nolen in a colloquy that included  several verbal exchanges , in 
which the court  both informed Nolen of his right to testify or 
not testify, and ascertained Nolen's "understanding of 
significant propositions in the advisement ."  Id. (cleaned up ).   
  On this record, we conclude that the circuit court 
conducted a proper Tachibana  colloquy, and that the circuit 
court was not wrong in finding that Nolen intentionally, 
knowingly, and intelligently waived his right to testify in his 
own defense.   
For the foregoing reasons, the circuit court's 
Judgment of Conviction and Sentence , filed on March 13, 2019 , is 
affirmed , without prejudice to Nolen's filing of an HRPP Rule 40
