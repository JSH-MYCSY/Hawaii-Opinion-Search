APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 16-1-0074) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By:  Reifurth, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
appellate jurisdiction over this appeal by Non-Parties/Appellants 
Lance Kamuela Gomes (Gomes), pro se, Punohu Nalimu Kekaualua, III 
(Kekaualua), pro se, and Noa Kaneali# i#iopono# i Mau-Espiritu (Mau-
Espiritu), pro se, from the Honorable Randal G.B. Valenciano's April 27, 2018 judgment on an order confirming the sale of 
foreclosed property in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee Citifinancial 
Servicing LLC (Citifinancial Servicing), and against Defendants-
Appellees Julius Henry Nordmeier, Jr. (Julius Nordmeier), pro se, 
Carmen Ellen Nordmeier (Carmen Nordmeier), pro se, Onemain 
Financial (HI), Inc. (Onemain Financial), pro se, and Association 
of Apartment Owners of Wai
#aka Village (AOAO 
Wai#aka Village), pro 
se, because (1) the notice of appeal is untimely and (2) Gomes, NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Kekaualua, and Mau-Espiritu are non-parties who lack standing to 
appeal. 
Although the circuit court's April 27, 2018 judgment 
was an appealable final judgment pursuant to Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS) ยง 667-51(a)(2) (2016) and Rule 54(b) of the 
Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP), Gomes, Kekaualua, and 
Mau-Espiritu filed their April 1, 2019 notice of appeal more than thirty days after entry of the April 27, 2018 judgment in 
violation of Rule 4(a)(1) of the Hawai# i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP).  The failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the parties 
cannot waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in the 
exercise of judicial discretion.  Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 
650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or 
judge or justice is authorized to change the jurisdictional 
requirements contained in Rule 4 of these rules."); HRAP Rule 
26(e) ("The reviewing court for good cause shown may relieve a 
party from a default occasioned by any failure to comply with 
these rules, except the failure to give timely notice of 
appeal.").  
 
Even if Gomes, Kekaualua and Mau-Espiritu would have 
filed their notice of appeal in a timely manner, they would still 
lack standing to appeal. 
Generally, the requirements of standing to appeal are:
(1) the person must first have been a party to the action;(2) the person seeking modification of the order or judgment
must have had standing to oppose it in the trial court; and(3) such person must be aggrieved by the ruling, i.e., the
person must be one who is affected or prejudiced by theappealable order.

(citations and internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis in 
original).  "In other words, non-parties, who did not or could 
not intervene, are ordinarily denied standing to appeal."  Id. 
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis in 
original).  In the instant case, Gomes, Kekaualua and Mau-
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Espiritu were not named parties in the underlying foreclosure 
case, nor did they intervene in it pursuant to HRCP Rule 24.  
Gomes, Kekaualua and Mau-Espiritu also have no right to 
appear as attorneys on behalf of any of the multiple defendants 
in this litigation, because Gomes, Kekaualua and Mau-Espiritu are 
not licensed to practice law in Hawai# i.  In fact, "[a]ny person 
violating sections 605-14 to 605-16 shall be guilty of a misdemeanor."  HRS ยง 605-17 (2016).  Absent a timely appeal by a 
party in the underlying case, we lack appellate jurisdiction. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
