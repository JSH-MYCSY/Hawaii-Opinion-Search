KENNETH M. SKAHAN, Claimant-Appellant/Appellant, v.
STUTTS CONSTRUCTION COMPANY, INC., Employer-Appellee,
and FIRST INSURANCE COMPANY OF HAWAII, LTD.,
Insurance Carrier-Appellee/Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD 
(CASE NO. AB 2015-372(M) (7-14-45072)) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL 
(By:  Reifurth, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Upon review of (1) this appeal by Claimant-Appellant/ 
Appellant Kenneth M. Skahan (Skahan) from the Labor and 
Industrial Relations Appeals Board's (the LIRAB) January 3, 2019 
decision and order regarding Skahan's workers' compensation claim 
in LIRAB Case No. AB 2015-372(M), and (2) the record, it appears 
that the January 3, 2019 decision and order does not qualify as 
an appealable final order under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 
ยง 386-88 (2015), HRS ยง 91-14(a) (2012 & Supp. 2018), and the 
holding in Mitchell v. State of 
Hawai# i, Dep't of Educ., 77 
Hawai# i
 305, 884 P.2d 368 (1994). 
As was the case in Mitchell, the LIRAB's January 3, 
2019 decision and order lacks the requisite decree of finality for an appeal under HRS ยง 386-88 and HRS ยง 91-14(a), because NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Skahan's right to any workers' compensation benefits for the 
March 25, 2014 psychological injury still remains undetermined. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court 
case number CAAP-19-0000329 is dismissed for lack of appellate 
jurisdiction. 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions 
in appellate court case number CAAP-19-0000329 are dismissed as 
moot.
