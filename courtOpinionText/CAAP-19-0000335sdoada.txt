This matter involves a dispute concerning a real 
property transaction. Plaintiff -Appellant Wheels of Justice, 
LLC (WOJ) appeals from the Amended Final Judgment, filed 
March 27, 2019 ( Amended Judgment ), entered by the Circuit Court 
of the Third Circuit ( circuit court ).1 
WOJ contends on appeal that the circuit court erred in 
granting summary judgment in favor of Title Guaranty Escrow 
Services, Inc. ( Title Guaranty ), and Island Title Corporation 
(Island Title ).2 Upon careful review of the record and relevant 
legal authorities, and having given due consideration to the 
arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we 
affirm the circuit court's Amended J udgment. 
"On appeal, the grant or denial of summary judgment is 
reviewed de novo." Ralston v. Yim, 129 Hawaiʻi 46, 55, 292 P.3d 
1276, 1285 (2013) (citations omitted). The court applies the 
following standard,  
[S]ummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, 
depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on 
file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there 
is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. A 
fact is material if proof of that fact would have the 
1 The Honorable Robert D.S. Kim presided. The Honorable Ronald 
Ibarra initially presided over this case through 2017. 
2 WOJ presents no discernible argument in support of its contention 
that "[b]y granting summary judgment to the Appellees , [sic] the Circuit 
Court violated [WOJ's] constitutional rights to due process and equal 
protection by denying it property, possession, and ownership interests." We 
thus decline to address that contention. In re Guardianship of Carlsmith , 
113 Hawaiʻi 236, 246, 151 P.3d 717, 727 (2007) (" [An appellate ] court may 
disregard a particular contention if the appellant makes no discernible 
argument in support of that position." (cleaned up) ).

effect of establishing or refuting one of the essential 
elements of a cause of action or defense asserted by the 
parties. The evidence must be viewed in the light most 
favorable to the non -moving party. In other words, we must 
view all of the evidence and inferences drawn therefrom in 
the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion .  
 
Id., at 55-56, 292 P.3d at 1285 -86. 
WOJ challenges the circuit court's entry of separate 
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order dated 
December 11, 2018 ( December 2018 Order ), and January 30, 2019 
(January 2019 Order ), respectively. The December 2018 Order 
awarded summary judgment in favor of Title Guaranty and against 
WOJ. The January 2019 Order awarded summary judgment in favor 
of Island Title and against WOJ. 
As the record reflects, Title Guaranty and Island 
Title satisfied their initial burden of production. Title 
Guaranty and Island Title provided evidence, including copies of 
the escrow and title insurance paperwork, showing that the 
parties to the property  transaction at issue were Nimble  Land, 
Inc. (Nimble)  and Hinchcliff  Investments LLC ( Hinchcliff ); WOJ 
was not a party.   Ralston, 129 Hawaiʻi at 60, 292 P.3d at 1290 
("[A] summary judgment movant may satisfy his or her initial 
burden of  production by either (1) presenting evidence negating 
an element of the non-movant's claim, or (2) demonstrating that 
the nonmovant will be unable to carry his or her burden of proof 
at trial." (citations omitted)).  
3

The burden then shifted to WOJ. Kondaur Cap. Corp. v. 
Matsuyoshi, 136 Hawaiʻi 227, 240-41 , 361 P.3d 454, 467-68  (2015) 
("Only with the satisfaction of [movant's] initial showing does 
the burden shift to the [non-moving] party to respond by 
affidavits or as otherwise provided in [Hawaiʻ i Rules of Civil 
Procedure] Rule 56, setting forth specific facts showing that 
there is a genuine issue for trial.")  (cleaned up)  (underscore 
omitted). WOJ did not meet its burden of establishing that, 
notwithstanding its non-party status, there exists  a genuine 
issue of material fact for trial.  
First, WOJ did not establish a genuine issue of 
material fact as to whether Title Guaranty owed any duty to WOJ, a non-party to the property transaction and/or escrow agreement. 
Pursuant to well-established law, Title Guaranty, as escrow, had 
a fiduciary duty to faithfully comply with the instructions of 
the parties  to the escrow agreement. DeMello v. Home Escrow, 
Inc., 4 Haw. App. 41, 47, 659 P.2d 759, 763 (App. 1983) ("The general rule is that an escrow depository occupies a fiduciary 
relationship with the parties to the escrow agreement or 
instructions and must comply strictly with the provisions of 
such agreement or instructions."  (citations  omitted)).

Second, WOJ did not establish a genuine issue of 
material fact as to whether Island Title owed any duty to WOJ, a 
non-party to the property transaction and title insurance 
agreement. Island Title acted as the authorized issuing agent 
for First American Title Insurance Company, with the role of 
facilitating the issuance of title insurance to Hinchcliff in 
its property transaction with Nimble. See  Chun v. Park, 
51  Haw.  462, 464, 462  P.2d 905, 907 (1969) (imposing upon title 
company, towards buyer and lender, "a duty to use reasonable or ordinary care in the preparation of the certificate of title 
search[.]").   Island Title did so with buyer Hinchcliff's 
written agreement that the sale would be subject to WOJ's claim.
   3
3 WOJ's recordation and notice of the lis pendens did not create a 
duty on the part of Title Guarant y or Island Title towards WOJ . The lis 
pendens provided notice to the buyer of the property, Hinchcliff , of WOJ's 
pending lawsuit. The lis pendens did not impose a duty upon Title Guarant y 
or Island Title to prevent the closing of the property sale. IndyMac Bank v. 
Miguel, 117 Hawaiʻi 506, 521, 184 P.3d 821, 8 36 (App. 2008) ("The doctrine of 
lis pendens is intended to protect a claimed interest in property from being 
defeated by a subsequent sale to a bona fide purchaser during the course of 
litigation." (citation omitted) ). In this case, the sale proceeded – at the 
parties' instruction – with Hinchcliff's written agreement that the sale 
would be subject to WOJ's claim.
