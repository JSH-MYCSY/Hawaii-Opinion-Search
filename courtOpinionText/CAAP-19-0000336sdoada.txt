OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
KAPANA B. THRONAS-KAHO# ONEI, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
(CR. NO. 16-1-0445 (5PC161000445)) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Ginoza, C.J., and Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Kapana B. Thronas- Kaho# onei  
(Thronas-Kaho# onei), self-represented, appeals from the Judgment 
of Conviction and Probation Sentence, filed on April 10, 2019, in 
the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit (Circuit Court).1/ 
Thronas- Kaho# onei  was convicted of Resisting Arrest, in 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 710-1026(1)(a) 
(2014).2/ On appeal, he contends that the Circuit Court lacked 
jurisdiction because the State of Hawai# i is a fraud, he is 
Kanaka Maoli, there is no treaty annexing the Hawaiian Islands, 
1/ The Honorable Kathleen N.A. Watanabe presided. 
2/ HRS ยง 710-1026(1)(a) provides: 
(1) A person commits the offense of resisting arrest
if the person intentionally prevents a law enforcement
officer acting under color of the law enforcement officer'sofficial authority from effecting an arrest by: 
(a) Using or threatening to use physical forceagainst the law enforcement officer oranother[.] NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
and the Hawaiian Islands are a sovereign state and illegally 
occupied. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve Thronas-
Kaho# onei's points of error as follows: 
The Hawai# i Supreme Court has held that "'whatever may 
be said regarding the lawfulness' of its origins, 'the State of Hawai# i is now, a lawful government.' Individuals claiming to be 
citizens of the Kingdom and not of the State are not exempt from application of the State's laws." 
State v. Kaulia
, 128 Hawai# i 
479, 487, 291 P.3d 377, 385 (2013) (brackets, ellipses, and internal citation omitted) (quoting 
State v. Fergerstrom
, 106 
Hawai# i 43, 55, 101 P.3d 652, 664 (App. 2004), 
aff'd
, 106 Hawai# i 
41, 101 P.3d 225 (2004)). 
Here, the State charged Thronas- Kaho# onei  based on his 
conduct in the County of Kaua# i.  Accordingly, Thronas-Kaho# onei 
was subject to the State's criminal jurisdiction in this case, and he was not exempt from the application of HRS ยง 710-1026(1). 
It is not clear, but it appears that Thronas-
Kaho# onei 
may also contend that his arrest was otherwise improper and that he was not guilty of the charged offense. If that is his contention, it is not supported by any discernible argument, and he fails to state any alleged error committed by the Circuit Court. Even if any such error were properly alleged on appeal, Thronas-Kaho# onei fails to cite to where in the record any error 
might have occurred.
3/ This contention is thus deemed waived and 
will not be addressed further. See Kakinami v. Kakinami
, 127 
Hawai# i 126, 144 n.16, 276 P.3d 695, 713 n.16 (2012) (citing 
In 
re Guardianship of Carlsmith
, 113 Hawai# i 236, 246, 151 P.3d 717, 
727 (2007) ("noting that this court may 'disregard a particular contention if the appellant makes no discernible argument in support of that position'"));
 Asato v. Procurement Policy Bd.
, 
132 Hawai# i 333, 354 n.22, 322 P.3d 228, 249 n.22 (2014) 
("However, these are not truly 'points of error' inasmuch as they

transcripts of the pre-trial or trial proceedings in the record on appeal.

do not state an 'alleged error committed by the court.'" 
(brackets omitted)); Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 
28(b)(4). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment of 
Conviction and Probation Sentence, filed on April 10, 2019, in the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit, is affirmed.
