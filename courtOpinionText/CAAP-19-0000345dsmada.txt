IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
KA#U SUNSHINE LLC, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
Unknown heirs or assigns of KAHAKU (k), KANAKALAUAI (w),
PAPALIMU (w), KAPANA (k), also known as W. KAPANA (k),
H. AKONA, MALAKINI (w), also known as MALAKINI APIKI (w)
and MALAKINI ENAENA (w), and ALL WHOM IT MAY CONCERN,
Defendants-Appellees, and ANDERSON X. LINDSEY,
Real Party In Interest-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 17-1-358)
ORDER
DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
AND
DISMISSING ALL PENDING MOTIONS AS MOOT
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
appellate jurisdiction over this appeal by Defendant-Appellant
Anderson Lindsey (Lindsey), self-represented, from the Honorable
Greg K. Nakamura's February 7, 2019 judgment in favor of
Plaintiff-Appellee Ka#u Sunshine LLC in Civil No. 17-1-358,
because Lindsey's April 12, 2019 notice of appeal is untimely
under Rule 4(a)(1) of the Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure
(HRAP).
Although the February 7, 2019 judgment was an
appealable final judgment under Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 641-
1(a) (2016) and Rule 58 of the Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure
under the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright,NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
76 Hawai# i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994), Lindsey did not
file his April 12, 2019 notice of appeal within thirty days after
entry of the February 7, 2019 judgment, as HRAP Rule 4(a)(1)
required for a timely appeal.  The failure to file a timely
notice of appeal in a civil matter is a jurisdictional defect
that the parties cannot waive and the appellate courts cannot
disregard in the exercise of judicial discretion.  Bacon v.
Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP Rule
26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or justice is authorized to change
the jurisdictional requirements contained in Rule 4 of these
rules."); HRAP Rule 26(e) ("The reviewing court for good cause
shown may relieve a party from a default occasioned by any
failure to comply with these rules, except the failure to give
timely notice of appeal.").  We lack appellate jurisdiction.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that CAAP-19-0000345 is
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions
in CAAP-19-0000345 are dismissed as moot.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, September 26, 2019.
