APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 17-1-0256) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By:  Reifurth, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
appellate jurisdiction over this appeal by Defendant-Appellant 
Anderson Lindsey (Lindsey) from the February 7, 2019 judgment 
entered by the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit in favor of 
Plaintiff-Appellee 
Ka#u Sunshine LLC in Civil No. 17-1-0256.  
Lindsey's April 12, 2019 notice of appeal is untimely under Rule 4(a)(1) of the Hawai# i
 Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP).  The 
February 7, 2019 judgment was an appealable final judgment under Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 641-1(a) (2016) and Rule 58 of the NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure under the holding in Jenkins v. 
Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
#i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 
1334, 1338 (1994).  Lindsey did not file his April 12, 2019 
notice of appeal within thirty days after entry of the 
February 7, 2019 judgment, as required by HRAP Rule 4(a)(1).  The 
failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a civil matter is a 
jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot waive and the 
appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise of judicial 
discretion.  Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127, 
1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or justice is 
authorized to change the jurisdictional requirements contained in 
Rule 4 of these rules.").  We lack appellate jurisdiction. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court 
case number CAAP-19-0000348 is dismissed for lack of appellate 
jurisdiction.
