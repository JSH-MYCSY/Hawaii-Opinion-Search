APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 16-1-0549) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL 
(By: Wadsworth, Presiding Judge, and Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of the May 11, 2023 motion to 
dismiss appeal as moot (Motion to Dismiss) filed by Plaintiff-
Appellee U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee For 
Structured Investment Loan Trust, Mortgage Pass-Through 
Certificates, Series 2005-7 (U.S. Bank), the papers in support, 
the record, and there being no opposition: 
1. Defendants-Appellants Michael H. Nguyen and Phuong 
Vu Nguyen, self-represented, appeal from the "Judgment on 
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting [U.S. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Bank's] Motion for Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure 
Against all Defendants on Complaint Filed October 21, 2016" 
(Foreclosure Judgment) and the "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of 
Law and Order Granting [U.S. Bank's] Motion for Summary Judgment 
and Decree of Foreclosure Against all Defendants on Complaint 
Filed October 21, 2016" (Foreclosure Decree), both entered on 
April 9, 2019, in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit. 
2. On March 21, 2023, U.S. Bank filed a motion for 
temporary remand (Temporary Remand Motion), by which U.S. Bank sought a temporary remand of this case to the Circuit Court of 
the Second Circuit (Circuit Court), so that the Circuit Court 
could consider and determine a motion to dismiss the underlying 
complaint and to vacate "the orders and judgment" that are the 
subject of this appeal. 
3. The Temporary Remand Motion was based on the 
declaration of counsel for U.S. Bank, which stated in part that: 
(a) counsel had been notified that the loan at issue had been 
paid off, making it possible for U.S. Bank to move for vacatur of 
the orders and judgment that are the subject of this appeal; (b) 
the Circuit Court had indicated its inclination to grant such a 
motion; and (c) if this case were temporarily remanded and such a 
motion were granted, upon the return of jurisdiction to this 
court, it was U.S. Bank's intention to seek dismissal of this 
appeal. 
4. On May 1, 2023, this court entered an order 
granting the Temporary Remand Motion (Temporary Remand Order) on 
the terms stated therein, including that the Circuit Court Clerk 
within sixty (60) days after the date of the Temporary Remand 
Order, but no later than May 20, 2023, file a supplemental record 
on appeal containing a copy of the Temporary Remand Order and all 
subsequently-filed documents. 
5. On May 3, 2023, the Second Supplemental Record on 
Appeal was filed.

6. On May 11, 2023, U.S. Bank filed the Motion to 
Dismiss, by which U.S. Bank sought dismissal of this appeal as 
moot, on the ground that "[w]ith the benefit of the temporary 
remand, U.S. Bank's motion to vacate the underlying orders and 
dismiss the complaint was granted by the [C]ircuit [C]ourt on 
May 1, 2023." 
7. The Motion to Dismiss is based on the declaration 
of counsel for U.S. Bank, which attaches a "true and correct 
copy" of the Circuit Court's May 1, 2023 Order Granting [U.S. 
Bank's] Motion for an Order Dismissing the Complaint Without 
Prejudice (Dismissal Order). 
8. The Dismissal Order: (a) dismisses Wells Fargo's 
Complaint, filed on October 21, 2016, in the underlying action 
without prejudice; and (b) vacates the Foreclosure Judgment and 
the Foreclosure Decree. 
9. Under Hawai#i law, mootness is an issue of 
justiciability. See State v. Hewitt
, 153 Hawai#i 33, 42, 526 
P.3d 558, 567 (2023). 
10. The mootness doctrine applies "where events 
subsequent to the judgment of the trial court have so affected the relations between the parties that the two conditions for 
justiciability relevant on appeal — adverse interest and 
effective remedy — have been compromised." Hamilton ex rel. 
Lethem v. Lethem
, 119 Hawai#i 1, 5, 193 P.3d 839, 843 (2008). 
11. The vacatur of the Foreclosure Judgment and the 
Foreclosure Decree, which are the subjects of this appeal, render the appeal moot. See In re TJ
, No. CAAP-21-0000596, 2022 WL 
16567553, at *1 (Haw. App. Nov. 1, 2022) (citing In re Marn Family
, 141 Hawai#i 1, 7, 403 P.3d 621, 627 (2016)). 
12. No exceptions to the mootness doctrine apply to 
this case, 
see Hamilton
, 119 Hawai#i at 5-10, 193 P.3d at 843-48 
(discussing "capable of repetition, yet evading review" and public interest exceptions, and adopting "collateral 
consequences" exception, to mootness doctrine).
