IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
LINCOLN HUESTON, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Respondent-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
(CR. NO. 5SPP-17-1-0001) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, and Hiraoka, and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Petitioner-Appellant Lincoln Hueston (Hueston) appeals 
from the "Order Denying [Hueston's] Petition for Revocation of 
Restitution [(Petition)] Filed on August 24, 2017," entered on 
March 21, 2019 (March 21, 2019 Order), in the Circuit Court of 
the Fifth Circuit (circuit court).1/ Hueston contends that the 
circuit court erred in denying the Petition, because it contained 
allegations that if proven would have entitled Hueston to relief. 
After reviewing the record on appeal and the relevant 
legal authorities, and giving due consideration to the issues raised and the arguments advanced by the parties, we resolve Hueston's contention as follows. 
I. Background 
In 2009, Hueston pleaded guilty to and was convicted of 
one count of Theft in the First Degree and forty-nine counts of 
1/ The Honorable Randal Valenciano presided.   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Forgery in the Second Degree.2/ At a June 3, 2009 sentencing 
hearing, the following exchange between the circuit court and 
Hueston regarding restitution occurred: 
[THE COURT:] And the amount of restitution that the 
Court is ordering -- this is through a freestanding order,
as requested by the prosecutors -- is $212,060.10. This is what has been verified by the probation department. The Court is, as I said, ordering a freestanding order. 
. . . [Y]ou're going to start making the payments on
the restitution, followed by the crime victim compensationfees, and I'm not going to waive any of that. You're goingto start making payments 60 days after you're released fromprison, and I'm proposing that you pay minimum payments of$200 a month. 
Now, Mr. Hueston, I know looking down the road, you
don't know what you're going to be doing, you don't knowwhat kind of employment you're going to be doing, butsetting it at $200 a month, Mr. Hueston, do you foresee aproblem with that after you get out of prison and getemployment? 
[HUESTON]: No, your Honor. 
THE COURT: All right. Very well. Then I'll note
that for the record. 
Pursuant to the June 10, 2009 Judgment of Conviction 
and Sentence (Judgment), Hueston was sentenced to, inter alia, 
ten years imprisonment for Theft in the First Degree and five 
years imprisonment for each count of Forgery in the Second Degree, all sentences to run concurrently. As was discussed at the sentencing hearing, Hueston's sentence also included the order to pay restitution in the amount of $212,060.00, as well as certain other fees, in monthly installments of no less than $200 commencing 60 days after release from incarceration. 
On June 10, 2009, the circuit court also entered its 
"Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting [Respondent-Appellee State of Hawaii's (State)] Oral Motion for 
Free-Standing Restitution Order," as well as a separate "Order of 
Restitution." The circuit court "conclude[d] that a separate free-standing restitution order obligating [Hueston] to pay the outstanding restitution beyond the expiration date of his

probation3/ term [was] warranted."4/ (Footnote added.) 
On August 24, 2017, Hueston filed the Petition. 
Hueston alleged that he was sentenced "to make payments of 
restitution totaling the amount of $217,400.00"; "[n]o hearing was held to determine if the amount of restitution was an amount that [Hueston] could afford to pay"; and "the amount of restitution imposed by the Court is an amount of which [Hueston] is unable to pay." He further stated that he was currently incarcerated; he earned 25 cents an hour in prison, which he "used for the purchase of basic needs"; and he would remain incarcerated until the end of his maximum sentence on May 28, 2019. Hueston concluded that "[p]ursuant to [HRS] § 706-645 and § 706-644(d) [sic], the Circuit Court may revoke [Hueston's] restitution" in this case, and requested a hearing on the Petition. 
In its March 21, 2019 Order, the circuit court denied 
the Petition without a hearing. 
II. Discussion 
We treat the Petition as a non-conforming Hawai# i Rules 
of Penal Procedure (
HRPP) Rule 40 petition.  See infra
. We 
review an order denying an HRPP Rule 40 petition without a hearing de novo, using the right/wrong standard of review. Dan 
v. State, 76 Hawai# i 423, 427, 879 P.2d 528, 532 (1994). "The 
3/ It appears that the court meant to reference Hueston's
"imprisonment term," rather than "probation term," as Hueston was not
sentenced to a term of probation in this case. 
4/ On January 7, 2014, pursuant to a motion by the State, and
following a December 16, 2013 hearing, the circuit court issued an "Order ReState's Motion to Amend the Judgment Filed on 6/10/09 to Conform to [HawaiiRevised Statutes (HRS)] 353-22.6" ( January 7, 2014 Order ). The January 7,
2014 Order concluded that HRS "§ 353-22.6 is to be applied to Hueston" and"the original judgment herein is not to interfere with the Department ofPublic Safety's, or any other State agency['s], enforcement of HRS § 353-22.6[.]" The January 7, 2014 Order further provided that "the director ofpublic safety shall enforce the instant victim restitution order against allmoneys earned by Hueston or deposited or credited to his individual accountwhile he is incarcerated[,]" by deducting twenty-five percent of the total ofsuch amounts, to be paid as restitution "to the victim once the amount reaches$25, or annually, whichever is sooner." 
The Petition does not challenge the January 7, 2014 Order, and it is not
mentioned in Hueston's opening brief. We thus deem any such issue waived.See
 Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(4), (7).

question on appeal of a denial of a Rule 40 petition without a 
hearing is whether the trial record indicates that Petitioner's application for relief made such a showing of a colorable claim as to require a hearing before the lower court." Lewi v. State, 
145 Hawai# i 333, 345, 452 P.3d 330, 342 (2019) (quoting Dan, 76 
Hawai# i at 427, 879 P.2d at 532). To establish a colorable claim 
of illegal sentence, the allegations of the petition must show that if taken as true the facts alleged would change the petitioner's sentence; however, a petitioner's conclusions need not be regarded as true. See id. (quoting Dan, 76 Hawai# i at 
427, 879 P.2d at 532). 
Hueston argues that the Petition established a 
colorable claim for relief under HRS § 706-645 by "assert[ing] [Hueston's] inability to pay restitution due to the length of his incarceration and the high amount of the restitution."
5/ Hueston 
further argues that these allegations "if taken as true, could have potentially changed the restitution amount to which [Hueston] was sentenced." 
HRS § 706-645 (2014) provides: 
(1) A defendant who has been sentenced to pay a fine
or restitution and who is not in contumacious default in the 
payment thereof may at any time petition the court whichsentenced the defendant for a revocation of the fine or restitution or of any unpaid portion thereof. 
(2) If it appears to the satisfaction of the court
that the circumstances which warranted the imposition of thefine or restitution have changed, or that it would otherwisebe unjust to require payment, the court may revoke the fineor restitution or the unpaid portion thereof in whole or inpart. Prior to revocation, the court shall afford theprosecuting attorney an opportunity to be heard. 
(Emphasis added.) The statute thus authorizes the sentencing 
court "to alter, amend, or revoke restitution orders on the basis of unforeseen or changed circumstances[.]" State v. Gaylord, 78 
Hawai# i 127, 153 n.50, 890 P.2d 1167, 1193 n.50 (1995). A 
petition under HRPP Rule 40 is the appropriate way to seek relief 
5/ The Petition also cited HRS § 706-644(d) as authorizing the
circuit court to revoke Hueston's restitution. To the extent that Hueston may
have intended to cite HRS § 706-644(4), which applies where "the defendant'sdefault in the payment of a fee, fine, or restitution is not contumacious,"that section did not apply here, where Hueston presented no evidence that hewas in default of the payment of restitution. Hueston does not rely on HRS§ 706-644 in the opening brief.

under HRS § 706-645. See State v. Kealoha, 142 Hawai# i 46, 63, 
414 P.3d 98, 115 (2018). 
Here, the Petition did not establish a colorable claim 
for revocation of restitution under HRS § 706-645. Hueston 
alleged in the Petition that "the amount of restitution imposed by the Court is an amount of which [Hueston] is unable to pay." However, Hueston's asserted inability to pay the amount of restitution was not, as a matter of law, an unforeseen or changed circumstance or other injustice authorizing a revocation of restitution. Specifically, HRS § 706-646(3) provides that "[i]n ordering restitution, the court shall not consider the defendant's financial ability to make restitution in determining the amount of restitution to order." HRS § 706-646(3) (Supp. 2016) (emphases added); see Commentary on HRS § 706-646 (2014) (noting that "Act 230, Session Laws 2006, amended this section to, among other things, require that when restitution is ordered, the amount ordered is not based on the defendant's financial ability to make restitution[.]"). Thus, a defendant's financial inability to make restitution was a foreseen circumstance, and the legislature determined that the amount of restitution ordered must not be based on the defendant's ability to make payment.
6/ 
In contrast, "[t]he court . . . shall consider the 
defendant's financial ability to make restitution for the purpose of establishing the time and manner of payment." HRS § 706-646(3). Here, at the June 3, 2009 sentencing hearing, Hueston stated that he did not "foresee a problem" in making minimum payments of $200 per month toward his restitution obligation after his release from prison. When Hueston filed the Petition in 2017, he stated that he was currently incarcerated and would remain incarcerated until the end of his maximum sentence on May 28, 2019. He did not allege unforeseen or changed circumstances or other injustice regarding the time or manner of payment of his restitution obligation after his release. Indeed, rather than seeking an alteration of the payment terms, i.e., 
6/ Accordingly, when the circuit court ordered restitution in 2009,
it was not required to hold a hearing "to determine if the amount of
restitution was an amount that [Hueston] could afford to pay." 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
monthly installments of $200 commencing 60 days after his release 
from prison, Hueston sought revocation of restitution based on his asserted inability to pay the amount of $212,060.00. 
We conclude that Hueston's asserted inability to pay 
the amount of restitution did not constitute an unforeseen or changed circumstance or other injustice authorizing a revocation of restitution under HRS § 706-645. Because Hueston failed to establish a colorable claim for relief under HRS § 706-645, the circuit court did not err in denying the Petition without a hearing. 
III. Conclusion 
For the reasons discussed above, the "Order Denying 
[Hueston's] Petition for Revocation of Restitution Filed on August 24, 2017," entered on March 21, 2019, in the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit, is affirmed.
