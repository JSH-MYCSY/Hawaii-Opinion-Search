Court's October 18, 2019 Order Granting Plaintiff[/Counterclaim 
Defendant-Appellee] Newtown Estates Community Association's 
[(Newtown's)] Motion for an Award of Attorney's Fees and Costs 
Against [Kaaihue] and [Defendant/Counterclaimant-Appellee Yong 
Nam Fryer (Fryer)2], as well as the Circuit Court's October 17, 
2019 Order Granting [Newtown's] Motion for an Award of Attorney's Fees and Costs Against [Kaaihue] and [Fryer]. (Orders Granting 
Attorneys' Fees). 
This consolidated appeal stems from a dispute about 
whether Kaaihue and Fryer's 82-acre property (Property) was 
subject to the restrictions and conditions of Newtown Estates. 
Newtown requires the homes in its community to comply with its Master Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions for 
the Newtown Estates at Waimalu, Hawai# i (MDCCR). Newtown had not 
enforced the MDCCR against previous owners of the Property. In 
2013, Newtown filed suit to compel Kaaihue and Fryer (Kaaihue's mother) to bring the Property into compliance with the MDCCR. 
Kaaihue and Fryer brought various counterclaims alleging, 
inter 
alia, that they had detrimentally relied on Newtown's representations to Kaaihue that the Property was not subject to 
2 Fryer did not file a Notice of Appeal in this case, and therefore,
is not an appellant. The Notices of Appeal in CAAP-19-0000805,
CAAP-19-0000806, and CAAP-19-0000357 bear only Kaaihue's signature. Kaaihue is not an attorney and is unable to represent Fryer's legal interests.Kaaihue repeatedly attempted to sign documents on behalf of Fryer in theCircuit Court; the Circuit Court properly denied such attempts and orderedKaaihue not to file any further pleadings on behalf of Fryer.

the MDCCR. On January 30, 2019, a jury determined, inter alia, 
that the Property was part of Newtown Estates and that the 
Property was subject to the MDCCR. 
In the Opening Brief, Kaaihue did not identify her 
points of error or specify where in the record the alleged errors occurred and where the alleged errors were objected to and preserved, as required by the appellate court rules. See
 
Hawai#i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP
) Rule 28(b)(4). Nevertheless, 
we interpret self-represented claims liberally and will address Kaaihue's arguments to the extent we are able to discern them. See, e.g.
, Erum v. Llego, 147 Hawai# i 368, 380, 465 P.3d 815, 827 
(2020). 
It appears that Kaaihue makes six arguments on appeal, 
contending that: (1) the Circuit Court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the litigation; (2) the jury erred in concluding that the Property was subject to the MDCCR, at least in part because Newtown did not act fairly in imposing the MDCCR on the Property; (3) the jury erred in failing to conclude that Kaaihue detrimentally relied upon the communications from Newtown indicating that the Property was not part of Newtown Estates; (4) the jury erred in failing to conclude that Kaaihue suffered Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress at the hands of Newtown; (5) Newtown was required to defend Kaaihue in a separate lawsuit involving the Property; and (6) the Circuit Court abused its discretion in awarding attorneys' fees. 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve Kaaihue's appeal as follows: 
(1) Kaaihue argues that the Circuit Court did not have 
subject matter jurisdiction over the litigation. The Hawai# i 
Supreme Court has held: 
Questions regarding subject matter jurisdiction may be
raised at any stage of a cause of action. When reviewing acase where the circuit court lacked subject matterjurisdiction, the appellate court retains jurisdiction, noton the merits, but for the purpose of correcting the errorin jurisdiction. A judgment rendered by a circuit courtwithout subject matter jurisdiction is void. 
Kellberg v. Yuen, 131 Hawai# i 513, 526, 319 P.3d 432, 445 (2014) 
(quoting Lingle v. Haw. Gov't Emps. Ass'n, 107 Hawai# i 178, 182, 
111 P.3d 587, 591 (2005)). 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS
) ยง 603-21.5(a)(3) (2016) 
provides the circuit courts with subject matter jurisdiction over 
"[c]ivil actions and proceedings". HRS ยง 501-1 (2018) establishes the Land Court and states, in pertinent part: 
ยง501-1 Court; jurisdiction; proceedings; location;
rules; practice, etc . A court is established, called the
land court, which shall have exclusive original jurisdiction
of all applications for the registration of title to landand easements or rights in land held and possessed in feesimple within the State, with power to hear and determineall questions arising upon such applications, and also havejurisdiction over such questions as may come before it underthis chapter, subject to the rights of appeal under thischapter. 
(Emphasis added.) 
4  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The supreme court has stated that "[t]he circuit courts 
are courts of general jurisdiction[.] Thus, the circuit court 
has jurisdiction over all civil causes of action unless precluded by the State Constitution or by statute." Sherman v. Sawyer, 63 
Haw. 55, 57-58, 621 P.2d 346, 348-49 (1980) (internal citations and footnotes omitted). Similarly, this Court has previously held that, 
[R]egardless of whether the land court enjoys exclusive
jurisdiction over amendments or alterations to a certificateof title, the circuit court has concurrent jurisdictionunder HRS ยง 501-1 to determine matters regarding title toland court property as recognized by [Iaea v. Iaea, 59 Haw.648, 586 P.2d 1015 (1978)]. As such, the Circuit Court hadjurisdiction . . . to determine the scope of [the easementat issue in that case], but did not have jurisdiction toorder an amendment to the . . . certificates of title. 
Childs v. Harada, 130 Hawai# i 387, 405, 311 P.3d 710, 728 
(App. 2013) (footnote omitted); see also Waimea Falls Park, Inc. 
v. Brown, 6 Haw. App. 83, 85 n.5, 712 P.2d 1136, 1138 n.5 (1985) (holding that "[HRS] chapter 501 does not contemplate that, after registration, every controversy involving registered land must be decided by the land court[]" and noting that "[w]e find nothing in the statutes or our case law indicating that the land court has exclusive jurisdiction over matters affecting registered land.") (internal citations omitted). 
As properly determined by the Land Court and the 
Circuit Court, the Circuit Court had jurisdiction to determine whether the Property was subject to the MDCCR. The only relief that would exclusively lay within the jurisdiction of the Land Court would be a request to modify the certificate of title. 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Newtown did not seek to amend the certificate of title. 
Kaaihue's Counterclaim prayed for general, special, and punitive damages, equitable relief, and costs and attorneys' fees; it did not request that the Circuit Court modify the certificate of title. Accordingly, the Land Court's exclusive jurisdiction was not invoked, and the Circuit Court had jurisdiction over this litigation. 
(2) Kaaihue makes multiple challenges to the 
sufficiency of the evidence and the jury's factual determinations. 
However, HRAP Rule 10 requires appellants to request 
transcripts that are not already part of the record, as they deem necessary for their arguments. HRAP Rule 10(b)(1)(A). If an appellant deems it unnecessary to have transcripts prepared, or if an appellant decides to order fewer than all of the transcripts, notice is required to be filed and served on the appellee(s). HRAP Rule 10(b)(2); (4). 
Kaaihue did not order trial transcripts in this matter. 
Instead, in her Reply Brief, Kaaihue referenced HRAP Rule 10 and 
stated, inter alia, that: 
The jury special verdict form asked the Jury to make a
ruling whether or not the Appellant's property was subjectedto the MDCCR's of Newtown Estates. In addition to the special verdict, multiple other verdicts were also renderedsimultaneously. This was all presented in the OpeningBrief, The Answering Brief, along with the final order, andtherefore, the Appellant deemed it unnecessary to seektranscripts. 
. . . . 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The appellant deemed unnecessary to detail the transcripts,
when Circuit Court lacked jurisdiction to hear a caseregarding "cloud on title", and "adverse possession". Manyrelated documents are already on file including the Jury'sverdict for the Appellant [sic] Court to Review. The case is simple, Land Court is exclusively reserved for specialissues including "clouds on title & adverse possession".Therefore Appellant followed all rules of the HRAP. 
Without transcripts of the trial proceedings, this 
Court is unable to review Kaaihue's arguments challenging the 
jury's verdict. 
(3) Kaaihue does not specify which attorneys' fees she 
believes were unlawfully imposed by the Circuit Court. Rather, she argues that Newtown's "abuse of authority" precluded it from seeking fines, costs, and attorneys' fees. She further argues, without factual or legal support, that $570,000 in fines and fees was "outrageous" and "would inflict emotional distress upon any reasonable and sensible person." Kaaihue identifies HRS chapter 421J as authority for her argument, but she does not explain or argue which section applies, or how the Circuit Court's Orders Granting Attorneys' Fees were inconsistent with the statute. We decline to search the record or otherwise attempt to discern factual and legal bases for Kaaihue's assertion on appeal. See Hawaii Ventures, LLC v. Otaka, Inc., 
114 Hawai# i 438, 480, 164 P.3d 696, 738 (2007) ("This court is 
not obligated to sift through the voluminous record to verify an appellant's inadequately documented contentions.") (citation omitted); see also Lindner v. Durkee, No. CAAP-17-0000537 & No. CAAP-17-0000578, 2022 WL 2134319, at *9 (Haw. App. June 14, 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2022) (mem. op.) (declining to search the record for factual or 
legal bases where the appellant did not specify which additional fees were unlawful under HRS ยง 421J-10). 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's December 4, 2019 
Judgment is affirmed.
