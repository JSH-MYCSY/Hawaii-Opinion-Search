Division  on September 26, 2019, and related judgments for1
1 The Honorable Hilary Benson Gangnes presided. attorney's fees entered by the district court on June 19, 2019. 
For the reasons explained below, we affirm the orders and 
judgments. 
On January 25, 2019, Sato filed a petition for ex parte 
temporary restraining order (TRO) and for injunction against 
harassment against Giese and Jeanne E. Nakashima. A TRO against 
Giese only was issued on January 25, 2019, and a hearing on the 
requested injunction was set for February 8, 2019. The TRO was 
extended and the hearing date was continued to March 27, 2019. 
On February 11, 2019, Sato filed a petition for TRO and 
for injunction against harassment against Knauss. A TRO was 
issued on February 11, 2019, and a hearing on the requested 
injunction was set for February 26, 2019. The TRO was extended 
and the hearing date was continued to March 27, 2019. 
At the hearing on March 27, 2019, counsel for Giese and 
Knauss requested a joint hearing. The district court granted the 
request over Sato's objection. The court reminded the parties 
that the applicable statute allowed for an award of attorney's 
fees to the prevailing party.2 The court heard testimony from 
Sato and her witnesses James Hardy Reinburg, Shannon Chun, and Kara Casebeer. Four exhibits were received into evidence. After 
Sato rested, Knauss and Giese each moved for a directed verdict. 
The district court granted the motions, and also declared Sato to 
be a vexatious litigant. 
On June 19, 2019, Knauss and Giese filed separate 
motions for attorney's fees. The district court granted both 
motions. Also on June 19, 2019, judgments were entered in favor 
of Knauss and against Sato for $2,094.24, and in favor of Giese 
and against Sato for $2,094.24. Sato appealed. We temporarily 
remanded for entry of final orders. On September 26, 2019, the 
district court entered written orders denying Sato's petitions 
for injunction and dismissing each petition with prejudice. We 
consolidated the appeals. 
2 The transcript of the joint hearing indicates that the court was 
familiar with the parties through previous cases. 
2  Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 604-10.5 (2016) is 
titled "Power to enjoin and temporarily restrain harassment." It
provides, in relevant part:  
(a) For the purposes of this section: 
"Course of conduct" means a pattern of conduct
composed 
of a series of acts over any period of time
evidencing a continuity of purpose. 
"Harassment"
 means: 
(1) Physical harm, bodily injury, assault, or the
threat of imminent physical harm, bodily injury,or assault; or 
(2) An intentional or knowing course of conductdirected at an individual that seriously alarmsor disturbs consistently or continually bothersthe individual and serves no legitimate purpose;provided that such course of conduct would causea reasonable person to suffer emotionaldistress. 
(b) The district courts shall have the power to
enjoin, prohibit, or temporarily restrain harassment. 
. . . . 
(g) . .
 . If the court finds by clear and convincing 
evidence  that harassment as defined in paragraph (1) of that
definition exists, it may enjoin for no more than threeyears further harassment of the petitioner, or thatharassment as defined in paragraph (2) of that definitionexists, it shall enjoin for no more than three years furtherharassment of the petitioner[.] . . . 
. . . . 
(h) The
 court may grant the prevailing party in an
action brought under this section costs and fees, includingattorney's fees. 
(Emphasis added.) "The clear and convincing evidence standard is 
an intermediate standard of proof greater than a preponderance of 
the evidence, but less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt 
required in criminal cases." Uyeda v. Schermer, 144 Hawai #i 163, 
174, 439 P.3d 115, 126 (2019) (cleaned up) (emphasis added). 
We review a trial court's findings of fact under the 
"clearly erroneous" standard. Birano v. State, 143 Hawai #i 163, 
181, 426 P.3d 387, 405 (2018). 
A finding of fact is clearly 
erroneous when the record lacks substantial evidence to support the finding or when, despite some evidence to support the 
3 finding, we are left with the definite and firm conviction in 
reviewing all of the evidence that a mistake has been committed. 
Id. "Substantial evidence" is "credible evidence which is of 
sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of 
reasonable caution to support a conclusion." In re Grievance 
Arbitration Between State of Hawai #i Organization of Police 
Officers and County of Kaua #i, 135 Hawai #i 456, 462, 353 P.3d 998,
1004 (2015) (citations omitted).  
We review conclusions of law under the "right/wrong" 
standard. Estate of Klink ex rel. Klink v. State, 113 Hawai #i 
332, 351, 152 P.3d 504, 523 (2007). A conclusion of law that is supported by the trial court's findings of fact and reflects an 
application of the correct rule of law will not be overturned. 
Id. 
When a conclusion of law presents mixed questions of fact 
and law, we review it under the "clearly erroneous" standard because the court's conclusions are dependent on the facts and 
circumstances of each individual case. Id. 
In denying Sato's petition against Knauss, the district 
court stated: 
The court finds that [Sato] -- that the statute
requires clear and convincing -- that [Sato] present clear
and convincing evidence that harassment by [Knauss] in theform of physical harm, bodily injury, assault, or the threatof imminent physical harm, bodily injury or assaultoccurred.  That's one part.  No physical assault or threat here. 
Or an intentional or knowing course of conduct
directed at [Sato] that seriously alarms or disturbsconsistently or continually bothers [Sato] and that servedno legitimate purpose, and that such course of conduct wouldcause a reasonable person to suffer emotional distress. 
The court finds that [Sato] has failed.  There's 
really not much evidence at all here, let alone clear andconvincing evidence of a course of conduct directed atMs. Sato by Mr. Knauss.  Ms. Knauss -- Ms. Sato's testimony-- the court just finds she seems to say conspiracy -- she-- she alleges a conspiracy without any convincing evidenceof one.  And Mr. Knauss, the fact that she's unhappy withhis actions as board president is not a grounds [sic] underthe statute for the court to enter an injunction. 
And I don't find a course of conduct here that would 
cause a reasonable person to suffer emotional distress. Even if I believe that Ms. Sato has suffered emotional distress, she doesn't meet the standard of the statute,which is the clear and convincing evidence. 
4 The court therefore denies the petition for injunction
against harassment and dismisses the temporary restraining
order. 
In denying Sato's petition against Giese, the district 
court stated: 
Okay.  The court finds here and, you know, [Sato] has
rested, that [Sato] has failed to meet her -- Ms. MelanieSato has failed to meet her burden of proving by clear andconvincing evidence that there has been a course of conductdirected at her by Ms. Giese that seriously alarms, anddisturbs consistently, or continually bothers [Sato], andserves no legitimate purpose, and that such course ofconduct would cause a reasonable person to suffer emotionaldistress. 
The court therefore denies the petition for injunction
against harassment and dismisses the TRO.  Dismisses with prejudice. 
. . . . 
Thi
s is -- and I -- and I have to say I think Ms. Sato
grossl
y exaggerates what she observes, what happens.  I 
think she -- I don't even know if she honestly believes alot of what she's saying.  I did not find her to be particularly credible as to most of her testimony.  In fact,if it weren't for the workers who were credible, I don'tknow that I'd believe there'd been any spraying going on,but I'm finding that her witnesses are more credible thanshe is so she had -- but that doesn't -- that doesn't meet the standard of the injunction.  It's -- you know, areasonable person would suffer emotional distress. . . . 
. . . . 
. .
 . The petition -- the -- the -- the allegations in
the pe
tition, none of them were proved by clear and
convincing credible evidence.  None of them. 
"It is well-settled that an appellate court will not 
pass upon issues dependent upon the credibility of witnesses and 
the weight of evidence; this is the province of the trier of 
fact." Fisher v. Fisher, 111 Hawai #i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 
(2006) (citation omitted). 
In this case, the district court's 
findings of fact were supported by substantial evidence — or lack 
thereof, to the extent Sato bore the burden of proof — and we are 
not left with a definite or firm conviction in reviewing all of 
the evidence that a mistake was committed. Birano, 143 Hawai #i 
at 181, 426 P.3d at 405. The district court's conclusions of law were supported by its findings of fact and reflect an application 
5 of the correct rule of law. Klink, 113 Hawai #i at 351, 152 P.3d 
at 523. 
Accordingly, the September 26, 2019 orders denying 
Sato's petitions for injunctions against Knauss and Giese are 
affirmed. The June 19, 2019 judgments for attorney's fees in 
favor of Knauss and Giese and against Sato are also affirmed.
