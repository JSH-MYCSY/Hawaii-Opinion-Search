APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 12-1-2207) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and Nakasone, JJ.) 
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Edmund M. Abordo, self-represented, 
(Abordo) appeals from the November 27, 2019 Judgment entered (on 
temporary remand) by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit 
(Circuit Court).  Judgment was entered against Abordo and 
Plaintiff-Appellee Cedric Ah Sing, and in favor of Defendants-Appellees Department of Public Safety (DPS), DPS Mainland Branch 
Administrator Shari Kimoto, Warden Todd Thomas, Mail Room Clerk 
C. Robertson, Correctional Officer C. Hoskins, and Unit Manager 1

R. Cook (collectively, Defendants).  Abordo also appears to 
challenge: (1) the December 21, 2018 Order of Dismissal Without 
Prejudice for Failure to Prosecute (Dismissal Order); and (2) the 
May 13, 2019 Order Denying Plaintiffs' Motion to Reinstate the 
Plaintiff's Case Per the Order of the Court Dismissing Without Prejudice Non-Hearing Motion (Order Denying Reinstatement). 
Abordo does not state points of error in compliance 
with Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(4), instead 
raising several questions, some of which cannot be discerned as alleging error.
2 It appears that Abordo contends that: (1) the 
Circuit Court abused its discretion in entering the Dismissal Order because the Circuit Court did not serve the Defendants with Abordo's complaint; and (2) the Circuit Court abused its discretion in entering the Order Denying Reinstatement because the order was entered in retaliation for Abordo's filing of a petition for writ of mandamus. 
Upon careful review of the record and the submissions 
of the parties, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by Abordo, we resolve Abordo's appeal as follows: 
(1) Abordo contends, in essence, that the Circuit 
Court abused its discretion in dismissing Abordo's complaint without prejudice for lack of prosecution (more than six years after the complaint was filed) because the Circuit Court was 
2 The Hawai #i Supreme Court has held that pleadings prepared by
self-represented litigants should be interpreted liberally, and such parties
should not be automatically foreclosed from appellate review because they failto comply with court rules. Erum v. Llego, 147 Hawai #i 368, 381, 465 P.3d
815, 828 (2020). 
Therefore, we address Abordo's arguments to the extent we
can discern them.

required to serve the complaint on the Defendants pursuant to 
Hawai#i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40(d) and failed to 
do so.3 This argument is without merit. 
HRPP Rule 40(c)(3) states: 
(3) SEPARATE CAUSE OF ACTION. If a post-conviction
petition alleges neither illegality of judgment nor
illegality of post-conviction "custody" or "restraint" butinstead alleges a cause of action based on a civil rightsstatute or other separate cause of action, the court shalltreat the pleading as a civil complaint not governed by thisrule. However, where a petition seeks relief of the natureprovided by this rule and simultaneously pleads a separateclaim or claims under a civil rights statute or otherseparate cause of action, the latter claim or claims shallbe ordered transferred by the court for disposition underthe civil rules. 
Here, the complaint does not allege an illegal judgment 
or illegal "post-conviction 'custody' or 'restraint,'" but rather 
asserted that Abordo and Ah Sing were entitled to compensatory and punitive damages from Defendants for the illegal seizure of Abordo and Ah Sing's legal mail. Accordingly, although the complaint nominally referenced HRPP Rule 40, pursuant to HRPP Rule 40(c)(3), the Circuit Court properly disposed of the case under the Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure. 
(2) Abordo contends that the Circuit Court's denial of 
his motion to reinstate the civil case against Defendants was a vindictive act due to Abordo's filing of a petition for writ of 
3 HRPP Rule 40(d) provides: 
(d) Response.  The State of Hawai #i shall be named as 
the respondent in the petition, and the petitioner shall
serve the petition on the respondent by delivering a filedcopy thereof to the prosecutor. Service may be made by theattorney for the petitioner, or the petitioner in a pro secase. If it appears that the petitioner is unable to effectprompt service of a filed copy of the petition or otherpleading under this rule, the court shall direct court staffto effect service on behalf of the petitioner.

mandamus against the Circuit Court. Abordo offers no support for 
this bare allegation, and we find none. 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's November 27, 
2019 Judgment is affirmed.
