IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
MATTHEW A. MELLOW, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
HONOLULU DIVISION 
(CASE NO. 1DTI-19-084061) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL 
(By:  Reifurth, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that: 
(1) On May 2, 2019, Defendant-Appellant Matthew A. 
Mellow (Mellow), pro se, filed the notice of appeal without the fees required by 
Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 
Rule 3(a); 
(2) On May 15, 2019, the court construed the document 
Mellow filed in this appeal on May 10, 2019, as a motion for 
leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis
, and denied it 
without prejudice to Mellow seeking relief in the underlying 
case, No. 1DTI-19-084061, or otherwise demonstrating compliance 
with HRAP Rule 24(a).  The court ordered that within ten days 
from the order, Mellow shall pay the filing fees or file in the NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
underlying case a motion for leave to proceed on appeal in forma 
pauperis.  The court further ordered that, among other things, if 
Mellow filed in the underlying case a motion for leave to proceed 
on appeal in forma pauperis, then the district court shall 
determine and enter a written order on the motion within fifteen 
days, and if the district court denied the motion, then within 
ten days after the district court entered its order, Mellow shall 
either file in this court a motion for leave to proceed on appeal 
in forma pauperis that complies with HRAP Rule 24(a) or pay the 
filing fees.  The court cautioned Mellow that "[f]ailure to file 
in this court a motion for leave to proceed in appeal in forma 
pauperis or pay the filing fees may result in the appeal being 
dismissed.  See HRAP Rule 24(c);"1 
(3) On May 16, 2019, Mellow filed in the underlying 
case a motion for leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis; 
(4) On May 23, 2019, the district court denied the 
motion for leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis; and 
(5) More than ten days have passed since the district 
court denied Mellow's motion for leave to proceed on appeal in 
forma pauperis, and Mellow has not paid the filing fees or taken 
any further action in this appeal.  Consistent with the May 15, 
1 HRAP Rule 24(c) states: 
(c)  Effect of denial of motion for leave to proceed
in forma pauperis.   If the motion to proceed in forma
pauperis is denied the movant shall, within 10 days after
the denial of such a motion, pay all unpaid filing fees andshall give security for costs.  Failure of the unsuccessful movant to pay the unpaid filing fees or to give security forcosts shall not affect the validity of the appeal, but isground for such action as the appellate court havingjurisdiction over the appeal deems appropriate, and mayinclude dismissal of the appeal.
