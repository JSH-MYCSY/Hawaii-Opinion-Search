(CASE NO. AB 2007-497 (DCD NO. 2-06-14727)
CASE NO. AB 2007-498 (DCD NO. 2-07-04617))
ORDER GRANTING JULY 11, 2009 MOTION TO
DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
Upon review of (1) the July 11, 2009 motion by
Employer/Appellee/Appellee American Healthways, Inc. (American
Healthways), Insurance Carrier/Appellee/Appellee St. Paul
Travelers (St. Paul Travelers), and Respondents-Appellees Gary N.
Kunihiro, Esq. (Kunihiro), and Shawn L.M. Benton, Esq. (Benton), 
to dismiss this appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction,
(2) the July 12, 2019 "joinder" by Respondent-Appellee Lorne K.
Direnfeld, M.D., in the July 11, 2019 motion to dismiss, (3) the
July 16, 2019 memorandum by Claimant/Appellant/Appellant Lola
Suzuki (Suzuki) in opposition to the July 11, 2009 motion to
dismiss, and (4) the record, it appears that we lack appellate
jurisdiction.  Suzuki appeals from three interlocutory orders
that the Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board (theNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
LIRAB) entered in the consolidated LIRAB matter comprised of
LIRAB Case No. AB 2007-497 and LIRAB Case No. AB 2007-498:1
(1)an April 16, 2019 interlocutory "Order"
denying Suzuka's four-part October 30, 2018
motion to strike, to dismiss, in limine, and
for sanctions;
(2)an April 26, 2019 interlocutory "Order
Denying Motion to Reconsider and Reopen"; and
(3)an April 26, 2019 interlocutory "Order
Setting Aside March 28, 2019 Order to Show
Cause[.]"
In administrative matters involving a claim for
workers' compensation benefits, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
§ 386-88 (2015) and HRS § 91-14(a) (2012 & Supp. 2018) authorize
an aggrieved party to appeal a final decision and order by the
LIRAB directly to the Hawai# i Intermediate Court of Appeals as
follows:
The appeal of a decision or order of the LIRAB is
governed by HRS § 91-14(a), the statute authorizing appeals
in administrative agency cases.  HRS § 91-14(a) authorizes
judicial review of a final decision and order in a contested
case or a preliminary ruling of the nature that deferral of
review pending entry of a subsequent final decision would
deprive appellant of adequate relief.  For purposes of HRS §
91-14(a), we have defined "final order" to mean an order
ending the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be
accomplished. . . .  Consequently, an order is not final if
the rights of a party involved remain undetermined or if the
matter is retained for further action.
Bocalbos v. Kapiolani Med. Ctr. for Women & Children, 89 Hawai# i
436, 439, 974 P.2d 1026, 1029 (1999) (citations and some internal
quotation marks omitted; emphasis added).  "In Bocalbos, th[e
supreme] court held that an order that finally adjudicates a
benefit or penalty under the worker's compensation law is an
appealable final order under HRS § 91-14(a), although other
issues remain."  Lindinha v. Hilo Coast Processing Co., 104
Hawai#i 164, 168, 86 P.3d 973, 977 (2004) (citation omitted;
emphases added).  As the Lindinha court summarized:
1The Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board (the LIRAB) was
comprised of Chairperson Danny J. Vasconcellos, Member Melanie S. Matsui, and
Member Marie C.L. Laderta.

Examining the law in other jurisdictions having similar
jurisdictional requirements for workers' compensation cases,
Bocalbos adopted the "benefit rule" exemplified in Colorado
Revised Statutes § 8–43–301(2), (10), and (11) (1998). That
statute "authorizes judicial review of 'any order which
requires any party to pay a penalty or benefits or denies a
claimant any benefit or penalty.'"  Bocalbos, 89 Hawai #i at
440, 974 P.2d at 1030. This court took into consideration
the unique nature of workers' compensation cases, stating
that "[a] workers' compensation case ... is an ongoing
proceeding[;] ... an inherent and unique characteristic of a
workers' compensation case is its piecemeal nature." Id. at
442, 974 P.2d at 1032. This court also considered the
"primary purposes of the Hawai#i workers' compensation law
[which were] prompt determination and disposition of claims
for compensation." Id.
Id. at 168-69, 86 P.3d at 977-79 (emphasis added).  For example,
"a decision that finally adjudicates the matter of medical and
temporary disability benefits is an appealable final order under
HRS § 91-14(a), even though the matter of permanent disability
has been left for later determination."  Bocalbos, 89 Hawai#i at
443, 974 P.2d at 1033.  In contrast, however, when the LIRAB's
determination of a claimant's workers' compensation claim for
benefits "has not been made[,] . . . the requisite decree of
finality is lacking with respect to th[e] case[,]" and the
appellate court lacks jurisdiction.  Mitchell v. State Dep't. of
Educ., 77 Hawai#i 305, 308, 884 P.2d 368, 371 (1994) (citation
omitted).
In the instant case, none of the three appealed
interlocutory orders finally adjudicated a benefit.  In fact, the
record on appeal does not contain any order that finally
adjudicates the six issues that the LIRAB intends to determine in
the underlying matter according to the LIRAB's July 24, 2018
third amended pretrial order for the consolidated LIRAB cases of
LIRAB Case No. AB 2007-497 and LIRAB Case No. AB 2007-498.  The
record indicates that relevant rights of the parties remain
undetermined, and that the LIRAB has retained this matter for
further action by the LIRAB.  Absent a final order that is
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
appealable under HRS § 386-88 and HRS § 91-14(a), we lack
appellate jurisdiction.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellee American
Healthways, St. Paul Travelers, Kunihiro and Benton's July 11,
2009 motion to dismiss this appeal is granted, and appellate
court case number CAAP-19-0000375 is dismissed for lack of
appellate jurisdiction.
