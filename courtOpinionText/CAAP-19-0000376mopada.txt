IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
CLEOFE SUES, and all others
similarly situated, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
NATIONAL DEBT RELIEF LLC, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 1CC181–1563) 
MEMORANDUM OPINION 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, and Wadsworth and Nakasone, JJ.) 
This appeal arises out of a dispute regarding a "Debt 
Negotiation Agreement" (Agreement
) between Plaintiff-Appellee 
Cleofe Sues (
Sues) and Defendant-Appellant National Debt Relief, 
LLC (NDR). NDR moved to compel arbitration of the dispute, 
pursuant to an arbitration provision contained in the Agreement. 
The Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court) denied 
NDR's motion.1/ NDR appeals from the June 4, 2019 "Order Denying 
'Defendant [NDR's] Motion to Compel Arbitration, to Stay 
Proceedings, or, in the Alternative, to Dismiss the Amended Class Action Complaint, Filed on January 8, 2019,' Filed March 13, 2019" (Order Denying Arbitration), entered in the Circuit Court. 
On appeal, NDR contends that the Circuit Court erred in 
denying NDR's motion to compel arbitration. NDR asserts that in refusing to compel arbitration, the Circuit Court improperly addressed "the enforceability of the [Agreement] as a whole" rather than "the arbitration clause standing alone."

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Based on precedent by the United States Supreme Court 
and the Hawai# i Supreme Court, we conclude that the Circuit Court 
erred in denying NDR's motion to compel arbitration. We thus 
vacate the Order Denying Arbitration and remand with instructions to enter an order granting NDR's motion to compel arbitration. 
I. Background 
On January 8, 2019, Sues filed an Amended Class Action 
Complaint (Complaint 
) alleging that NDR is a for-profit debt 
adjuster conducting business in Hawai# i in violation of Hawaii 
Revised Statutes (HRS
) § 446-2 (2013 Repl.).2/ The Complaint 
alleges that Sues hired NDR as a debt adjuster to help her manage her debts with three creditors, and from January 30, 2017 to February 1, 2018, she deposited a certain amount with NDR each month to adjust her debts. The Complaint further alleges that only one of Sues's three accounts was settled by NDR, and when one of the remaining two creditors filed a lawsuit against Sues, NDR left her without assistance. The Complaint asserts that NDR "violated [HRS] § 446-2's prohibition against debt adjusting without proper exemption as identified under [HRS] § 446-3[,]" and "[t]herefore, [NDR] engaged in commercial conduct that violates public interest and constitutes a per se violation of [HRS] § 480-13." 
NDR filed a motion to compel arbitration pursuant to 
the arbitration clause contained in the Agreement. That clause provides in part: 
In the event of any controversy, claim, or dispute between
the parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement,the parties agree to resolve all issues solely through theuse of Binding Arbitration, governed by the rules of theAmerican Arbitration Association ("AAA"). . . . . The arbitrator or arbitration panel shall have the exclusive and 
2/ HRS § 446-2 provides: 
Debt adjusting prohibited; penalty; contracts void.
Any person who acts or offers to act as a debt adjuster inthis State shall be fined not more than $500 or imprisonednot more than six months, or both. Any contract for debtadjusting entered into with a person engaged in the businessfor a profit shall be void and unenforceable and the debtormay recover from the debt adjuster all sums or thingsdeposited with the debt adjuster and not disbursed to thedebtor's creditors. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
sole authority to resolve any dispute relating to the
interpretation, applicability, enforceability,conscionability or formation of this Agreement and of thisarbitration requirement. . . . 
In opposing the motion to compel arbitration, Sues 
argued that the Agreement is unenforceable and void pursuant to 
HRS § 446-2, and thus the arbitration clause contained in the Agreement cannot be enforced. In reply, NDR argued that the validity of the Agreement as a whole and the validity of the arbitration clause must be considered separately, and that Sues failed to show that the arbitration clause is unenforceable. 
The Circuit Court heard NDR's motion to compel 
arbitration on April 17, 2019. After hearing argument from both sides, the court denied the motion, stating that "[HRS §] 446-2 makes it clear that any contract for debt adjusting entered into with a person engaged in the business for a profit shall be void and unenforceable[,]" and, therefore, the court "[cannot] find that there is an unenforceable agreement to arbitrate." The court subsequently issued the Order Denying Arbitration. 
II. Standard of Review 
The standard for appellate review of a motion to compel 
arbitration is the same as a motion for summary judgment. Koolau 
Radiology, Inc. v. Queen's Med. Ctr., 73 Haw. 433, 439-40, 834 P.2d 1294, 1298 (1992). The appellate court reviews "the circuit court's grant or denial of summary judgment de novo." Querubin 
v. Thronas, 107 Hawai# i 48, 56, 109 P.3d 689, 697 (2005) (quoting 
Hawai# i Cmty. Fed. Credit Union v. Keka, 94 Hawai# i 213, 221, 11 
P.3d 1, 9 (2000)). 
The de novo review is "based upon the same 
evidentiary materials as were before [the trial court] in determination of the motion." Koolau Radiology, 73 Haw. at 440, 
834 P.2d at 1298 (quoting 
Feliciano v. Waikiki Deep Water, Inc., 
69 Haw. 605, 607, 752 P.2d 1076, 1078 (1988)) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
III. Discussion 
NDR argues: "It is undisputed that Sues entered into 
[the Agreement] with [NDR]," and the Agreement contains a "broad 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
arbitration clause[.]" According to NDR: 
When a Circuit Court is faced with a motion to compel
arbitration in accordance with an arbitration clause in a 
contract, the Circuit Court is only permitted to considertwo questions: whether the agreement to arbitrate containedwithin the contract is enforceable, and whether the claim iswithin the scope of the arbitration clause. Any claimsregarding the validity of the entire contract may not bedetermined by the Circuit Court, but must be determined bythe arbitrator if the agreement to arbitrate standing aloneis enforceable. 
Here, NDR contends, "it is undisputed that [Sues's] claims are 
within the scope of the arbitration clause[,]" so the only issue is whether the arbitration clause itself is enforceable. According to NDR, the Circuit Court erred in determining the validity of the Agreement as a whole rather than considering only the enforceability of the arbitration clause. NDR contends that as a matter of substantive federal arbitration law, which applies to this dispute involving interstate commerce, an arbitration provision is severable from the remainder of the contract, citing Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U.S. 440 (2006), Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U.S. 1 (1984), Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U.S. 395 (1967), Brown v. KFC Nat'l Mgmt. Co., 82 Hawai# i 226, 921 P.2d 146 (1996), and Lee v. 
Heftel, 81 Hawai# i 1, 911 P.2d 721 (1996). NDR concludes that, 
because "Sues presented no challenge to the arbitration clause standing alone[,]" that clause must be enforced. 
Sues, on the other hand, starts with the proposition 
that "[a]rbitration is a matter of contract[,]" and "[i]f there is no contract, the court cannot order arbitration." Sues continues: 
[T]he issue of whether there is a valid and enforceable
contract here has already been determined by the Hawaii
legislature through legislation [ i.e. , HRS § 446-2] that
states that the contract upon which NDR relies is void. It 
does not leave it to courts (or an arbitrator) to decideunder common law that a contract may eventually be declaredvoid or voidable. 
Here, Sues contends, the entire Agreement is void under HRS 
§ 446-2. "[T]herefore[,] all of the provisions within it, including the arbitration provision cannot be severed out and enforced."

"When presented with a motion to compel arbitration, 
the court is limited to answering two questions: 1) whether an 
arbitration agreement exists between the parties; and 2) if so, whether the subject matter of the dispute is arbitrable under such agreement."
3/ Brown, 82 Hawai# i at 238, 921 P.2d at 158 
(quoting Koolau Radiology, 73 Haw. at 445, 834 P.2d at 1300) (brackets omitted). Given Sues's arguments on appeal – that the entire Agreement is void and severance of the arbitration provision is not appropriate
4/ – our focus is on the first 
question, whether an arbitration agreement exists between the parties.
 A court determines the validity and enforceability of 
an arbitration agreement based on three elements: "(1) it must be in writing; (2) it must be unambiguous as to the intent to submit [the dispute] to arbitration; and (3) there must be bilateral consideration." Gabriel v. Island Pacific Academy, 
Inc., 140 Hawai# i 325, 334, 400 P.3d 526, 535 (2017) (quoting 
Douglass v. Pflueger Hawaii, Inc., 110 Hawai# i 520, 531, 135 P.3d 
129, 140 (2006)). 
There is no dispute that the Gabriel elements are met 
in this case: the arbitration provision is in writing, there is an unambiguous intent to submit the dispute to arbitration, and there is bilateral consideration. The arbitration clause in the Agreement expressly states in part: "In the event of any controversy, claim, or dispute between the parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the parties agree to resolve all issues solely through the use of Binding Arbitration, governed by the rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA")." 
The crux of this appeal is whether HRS § 446-2, which 
voids "[a]ny contract for debt adjusting entered into with a 
3/ The Agreement here contains a choice of law provision stating that
it "shall be governed by the law of the State of New York[.]" In its opening
brief, NDR relies primarily on federal and Hawai #i law, but also cites New
York authority, as applicable, and notes that "[t]here are no materialdifferences among federal, 
Hawai #i and New York law on the issues raised in 
this appeal." Sues relies on federal and Hawai #i law. Under these 
circumstances, we apply federal (see infra
 note 5) and Hawai #i law, as
applicable, in determining this appeal. 
4/ Sues does not dispute that the subject matter of the Amended
Complaint falls within the scope of the arbitration provision.

person engaged in the business for a profit," voids the 
arbitration provision in the Agreement. Because Sues's argument is not a specific challenge to the validity of the arbitration provision, we conclude that under the prevailing case law, the Circuit Court erred in failing to sever and enforce the arbitration clause. 
We recently discussed the prevailing case law in Inoue 
v. Harbor Legal Group, No. CAAP-19-0000589, 2021 WL 1700940, at *1 (Haw. App. Apr. 29, 2021) (Mem. Op.), where we affirmed the trial court's order compelling arbitration in similar circumstances. There, we described the controlling precedent as follows: 
In Buckeye, the plaintiffs entered deferred-payment
transactions with the defendant Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc.,
in which plaintiffs received cash in exchange for a personalcheck in the amount of the cash plus a finance charge. For each transaction there was an agreement that contained anarbitration provision. The plaintiffs filed a class actionlawsuit in Florida state court "alleging that Buckeyecharged usurious interest rates and that the Agreementviolated various Florida lending and consumer-protectionlaws, rendering it criminal on its face." 546 U.S. at 443. Buckeye sought to compel arbitration. The trial court denied the motion to compel arbitration, the Florida courtof appeal reversed, the Florida Supreme Court reversed theappellate court, and the case was accepted for review by theU.S. Supreme Court. Id.
The U.S. Supreme Court stated the issue before it as
follows: "We decide whether a court or an arbitrator should consider the claim that a contract containing an arbitrationprovision is void for illegality." Id. at 442. The court 
first noted the application of the Federal Arbitration Act(FAA),
5/ stating: 
To overcome judicial resistance to arbitration,Congress enacted the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9U.S.C. §§ 1–16. Section 2 embodies the national policyfavoring arbitration and places arbitration agreementson equal footing with all other contracts: 
5/ As noted in Inoue: 
The FAA applies to written arbitration provisions in
"any maritime transaction or a contract evidencing atransaction involving commerce[.]" 9 U.S.C. § 2 (1976).Thus, it "rests on the authority of Congress to enactsubstantive rules under the Commerce Clause[,]" and thesubstantive rules of the FAA apply in state and federalcourts. Southland Corp., 465 U.S. at 11, 12. 
2021 WL 1700940, at *3 n.3. As in Inoue, no party disputes that the FAAapplies in this case. 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 "A written provision in ... a contract ... to
settle by arbitration a controversy thereafterarising out of such contract ... or an agreementin writing to submit to arbitration an existingcontroversy arising out of such a contract ...shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or inequity for the revocation of any contract." 
Id. at 443-44. 
The court then explained: 
Challenges to the validity of arbitration agreements
"upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity forthe revocation of any contract" can be divided intotwo types. One type  challenges specifically the
validity of the agreement to arbitrate. See, e.g.,
Southland Corp. v. Keating , 465 U.S. 1, 4–5, 104 S.Ct.
852, 79 L.Ed.2d 1 (1984) (challenging the agreement toarbitrate as void under California law insofar as it purported to cover claims brought under the stateFranchise Investment Law). The other  challenges the
contract as a whole, either on a ground that directly
affects the entire agreement ( e.g. , the agreement was
fraudulently induced), or on the ground that the
illegality of one of the contract's provisions rendersthe whole contract invalid. Respondents' claim is ofthis second type. The crux of the complaint is thatthe contract as a whole (including its arbitrationprovision) is rendered invalid by the usurious financecharge. 
In Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co. , 388
U.S. 395, 87 S.Ct. 1801, 18 L.Ed.2d 1270 (1967), we
addressed the question of who—court or arbitrator—decides these two types of challenges. The issue inthe case was "whether a claim of fraud in the inducement of the entire contract is to be resolved bythe federal court, or whether the matter is to be
referred to the arbitrators." Id., at 402, 87 S.Ct.
1801. Guided by § 4 of the FAA, we held that "if the
claim is fraud in the inducement of the arbitration clause itself—an issue which goes to the making of theagreement to arbitrate—the federal court may proceedto adjudicate it. But the statutory language does notpermit the federal court to consider claims of fraud
in the inducement of the contract generally." Id., at
403–404, 87 S.Ct. 1801 (internal quotation marks and
footnote omitted). We rejected the view that thequestion of "severability" was one of state law, sothat if state law held the arbitration provision notto be severable a challenge to the contract as a wholewould be decided by the court. See id., at 400,402–403, 87 S.Ct. 1801. 
Subsequently, in Southland Corp. , we held that the FAA
"create[d] a body of federal substantive law," which
was "applicable in state and federal courts." 465U.S., at 12, 104 S.Ct. 852 (internal quotation marksomitted). We rejected the view that state law couldbar enforcement of § 2, even in the context ofstate-law claims brought in state court. See id., at
10–14, 104 S.Ct. 852; see also Allied–Bruce Terminix 
Cos. v. Dobson , 513 U.S. 265, 270–273, 115 S.Ct. 834,
130 L.Ed.2d 753 (1995). 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
. . . 
Prima Paint  and Southland  answer the question
presented here by establishing three propositions.
First, as a matter of substantive federal arbitrationlaw, an arbitration provision is severable from theremainder of the contract. Second, unless thechallenge is to the arbitration clause itself, theissue of the contract's validity is considered by thearbitrator in the first instance. Third, thisarbitration law applies in state as well as federalcourts. The parties have not requested, and we do notundertake, reconsideration of those holdings. Applyingthem to this case, we conclude that becauserespondents challenge the Agreement, but notspecifically its arbitration provisions, thoseprovisions are enforceable apart from the remainder ofthe contract. The challenge should therefore beconsidered by an arbitrator, not a court. 
Id. at 444-46 (emphases added) (footnotes omitted). 
In Lee v. Heftel, 81 Hawai #i 1, 911 P.2d 721 (1996),
the appellants challenged a trial court's order compellingarbitration, asserting that fraud in the inducement wasgrounds to revoke the subject real estate contract such thatthe contract's arbitration clause was not enforceable. Id. 
at 2, 911 P.2d at 722. The Hawai #i Supreme Court analyzed
Prima Paint and other federal case law and held that, "whereno claim is made that fraud was directed to the arbitration clause itself, a broad arbitration clause will be held toencompass arbitration of the claim that the contract itselfwas induced by fraud." Id. at 4, 911 P.2d at 724 (quoting
Prima Paint, 388 U.S. at 404). 
Further, although not directly addressing the issue
raised in this appeal, the Hawai #i Supreme Court in Siopes
[v. Kaiser Found. Health Plan, Inc., 130 Hawai #i 437, 457
n.28, 312 P.3d 869, 889 n.28 (2013),] recognized that anarbitration provision is severable from the rest of acontract, including as recognized in Buckeye. In Siopes,the Hawai #i Supreme Court stated: 
In Brown , this court recognized that "[f]or almost
forty years, arbitration agreements have beenregarded, as a matter of federal law, as severable anddistinct from the underlying agreement." 82 Hawai #i at 
245, 921 P.2d at 165. The court held that generally,"an arbitration agreement is severable from the
writing in which it is embedded." Id. at 246, 921 P.2d
at 166. See Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna ,
546 U.S. 440, 445, 126 S.Ct. 1204, 163 L.Ed.2d 1038
(2006) ("as a matter of substantive federalarbitration law, an arbitration provision is severablefrom the remainder of the contract"); Richard A. Lord,
21 Williston on Contracts  245 (4th ed. 2001)
("Ordinarily, an arbitration clause will be treated as
a separate contract, and severable from the main bodyof the contract. Thus, whenever possible, anarbitration clause will be held severable ....")(footnote omitted).

Inoue, 2021 WL 1700940, at *3-5 (some emphases added, footnote 
renumbered and altered). 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Given the prevailing case authority and Sues's failure 
to challenge the arbitration provision itself, we conclude that 
the Circuit Court erred in not severing the arbitration clause from the rest of the Agreement and enforcing the agreement to arbitrate. Accordingly, the Circuit Court erred in denying NDR's motion to compel arbitration. 
IV. Conclusion 
For the reasons discussed above, we vacate the June 4, 
2019 "Order Denying 'Defendant [NDR's] Motion to Compel Arbitration, to Stay Proceedings, or, in the Alternative, to Dismiss the Amended Class Action Complaint, Filed on January 8, 2019,' Filed March 13, 2019," entered in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit. The case is remanded to the Circuit Court with instructions to enter an order granting NDR's motion to compel arbitration.
