Dkt. 127 SONOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
the First Circuit on April 23, 2019.2  The AOAO challenges the:
(1) July 7, 2016 order denying its motion to dismiss Tropical's
complaint;3 and (2) February 11, 2019 order granting in part and
denying in part Tropical and Beeck's motion for partial summary
judgment.  We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand forfurther proceedings.
(1)We review a ruling on a motion to dismiss de novo. 
We assume the facts alleged in Tropical's complaint are true and
view them in the light most favorable to Tropical to determine ifthey warrant relief under any legal theory.  Bank of Am., N.A. v.
Reyes-Toledo , 143 Hawai #i 249, 256-57, 428 P.3d 761, 768-69
(2018).
Tropical's complaint alleged that Tropical contracted
with the AOAO to hydro-jet the Moana Pacific's laundry andkitchen sink drain lines.  A copy of the contract was attached.  The AOAO terminated the contract before Tropical began its work.
The AOAO argued the contract was void because it didn't
contain information about lien rights, bonding, and Tropical'sstatutory right to resolve alleged construction defects beforelitigation, as required by Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 444-
25.5.
Tropical argued that the AOAO was not a "homeowner" to
whom HRS § 444-25.5 applied.  We need not resolve that legalissue because HRS § 444-25.5 does not apply to a contract formaintenance work that does not require a permit.  HawaiiAdministrative Rules ( HAR) § 16-77-80(c) (eff. 2002).  Viewing
the allegations in the complaint in the light most favorable to
Tropical, the scope of work under Tropical's contract is"service-type work (e.g., maintenance work performed by . . .plumbing contractors) that does not require a permit by a countyor other local subdivision of the State."  Id.
  The circuit court
was not wrong to deny the AOAO's motion to dismiss.

3The Honorable Virginia L. Crandall presided.

(2)Tropical and Beeck moved for partial summary
judgment on its claim for breach of contract and the AOAO's
counterclaim for negligent misrepresentation and fraud in theinducement on December 21, 2018.
4  The AOAO counter-moved for
partial summary judgment on Tropical's claim for breach ofcontract on December 28, 2018.  On February 11, 2019, the circuitcourt entered orders granting summary judgment for Tropical onits claim for breach of contract and on the AOAO's claims fornegligent misrepresentation, fraud, and conspiracy, and denyingthe AOAO's counter-motion.
We review a grant of summary judgment de novo.  Nozawa
v. Operating Engineers Local Union No. 3 , 142 Hawai #i 331, 338,
418 P.3d 1187, 1194 (2018).  Summary judgment is appropriate ifthere is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving partyis entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.  Id.
 at 342, 418
P.3d at 1198.  A fact is material if it would establish or refutean element of a cause of action or defense.  Id.
  The evidence is
viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.  Id.  
(a)The AOAO's second amended counterclaim alleged
that Beeck negligently misrepresented Tropical's hydro-jetting
experience, and that Beeck, Tropical's CEO Olivia Kwong, and the
AOAO's former resident manager Randy Kowalkowski  fraudulently
induced the AOAO to sign the contract.
To prove negligent misrepresentation the AOAO must
show: (1) false information was supplied because of failure toexercise reasonable care or competence in communicating theinformation; (2) the AOAO relied on the false information; and(3) the AOAO suffered a loss.  Santiago v. Tanaka
, 137 Hawai #i
4Tropical moved for summary judgment on its claim for breach of the
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, but that claim was dismissedby stipulation of the parties on February 12, 2019.  Tropical also moved forsummary judgment on the AOAO's counterclaim that Beeck, Kwong, and Kowalkowskiconspired to defraud the AOAO, but "[c]ivil conspiracy does not aloneconstitute a claim for relief."  Robert's Haw. Sch. Bus, Inc. v. Laupahoehoe
Transp. Co. , 91 Hawai #i 224, 260 n.44, 982 P.2d 853, 889 n.44 (1999)

3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
137, 154, 366 P.3d 612, 629 (2016).  To prove fraudulent
inducement sufficient to invalidate the contract, the AOAO mustshow (1) a representation of a material fact, (2) made to inducethe AOAO to act, (3) known to be false but reasonably believedtrue by the AOAO, and (4) on which the AOAO reasonably relied andacted to its damage.  Matsuura v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.
,
102 Hawai #i 149, 162–63, 73 P.3d 687, 700–01 (2003).
Viewed in the light most favorable to the AOAO, the
AOAO's evidence showed that Tropical misrepresented its hydro-jetting experience to the AOAO, and the AOAO relied on Tropical'smisrepresentation and would not have contracted with Tropical hadit known of Tropical's lack of experience.  Tropical argues thatany misrepresentation to the AOAO was made by Kowalkowski (theAOAO's resident manager), not Tropical.  But the AOAO presentedevidence of the relationship between Kowalkowski and Beeck that,when viewed in the light most favorable to the AOAO, could showthat Kowalkowski acted as Tropical's agent.  Whether Tropicalexercised reasonable care or competence in communicating itshydro-jetting experience, whether Kowalkowski was Tropical'sagent, and whether the AOAO's reliance was reasonable, arequestions for the trier of fact that should have precludedsummary judgment.
(b)If the AOAO proves that Tropical fraudulently
induced it to contract for the hydro-jetting, the contract would
be invalid.  There were genuine issues of material factprecluding summary judgment on the AOAO's fraudulent inducementclaim.  The circuit court thus erred by granting summary judgmentfor Tropical on its breach-of-contract claim.
For these reasons, the July 7, 2016 "Order Denying
Defendant Association of Apartment Owners of Moana Pacific'sMotion to Dismiss Plaintiff Tropical Plumbing & Bath, Inc.'sComplaint with Prejudice, Filed on May 31, 2016" is affirmed; theFebruary 11, 2019 "Order Granting in Part and Denying in PartWithout Prejudice Plaintiff/Counterclaim Defendant TropicalPlumbing & Bath, Inc. and Additional Counterclaim Defendant
