MATTHEW MELLOW, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
HONOLULU DIVISION
(CASE NO. 1DTI-19-008261)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.)
Upon review of the record, it appears that:
(1) On May 10, 2019, self-represented Defendant-
Appellant Matthew A. Mellow (Mellow) filed the notice of appeal
without the fees required by Hawai#i Rules of Appellate Procedure
(HRAP) Rule 3(a);
(2) On May 17, 2019, the appellate clerk notified
Mellow to pay the filing fees or file a motion for leave to
proceed on appeal in forma pauperis on or before May 28, 2019, or
the appeal could be dismissed;
(3) The appellate clerk mailed the May 17, 2019 notice
to Mellow at the address indicated on the notice of appeal, and
no return mail was received;
(4) On September 5, 2019, the appellate clerk entered a
default of the record on appeal, informing Mellow that the timeNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
to docket the appeal expired on July 9, 2019, he had not paid the
filing fees or obtained an order allowing him to proceed on
appeal in forma pauperis, the matter would be brought to the
court's attention on September 15, 2019, for action that may
include dismissal of the appeal, and he could seek relief from
default by motion;
(5)The appellate clerk mailed the September 5, 2019
notice to Mellow at his address on record.  The United States
Postal Service returned the envelope marked, "Return to Sender,
Refused, Unable to Forward."  Mellow has not filed a notice of
change of address, consistent with HRAP Rule 25(f), and he took
no further action in this appeal; and
(6)An appeal may be dismissed where the record on
appeal has not been prepared because the appellant failed to pay 
the required fees or obtain an order allowing the appellant to
proceed in forma pauperis .  HRAP Rule 11(b)(2), (c)(2).
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is
dismissed.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai#i,February 20, 2020.
