which could include dismissal of the appeal, under Hawai# i Rules

(7) On November 29, 2019, the court granted the 
October 23, 2019 Motion, and found the court has jurisdiction in 
this appeal; 
(8) On December 18, 2019, Newman filed the Motion to 
Correct Driving Abstract of Defendant and Settle Case, where he 
seeks an order directing the district court to remove the 
"conviction" from his driving abstract until the appeal is

Hawai# i to honor its pre-trial settlement offer; and 
(9) At no time has Newman responded to the

Rule 30. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are 
dismissed.
