IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
ROBERTA WILBORN, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1CPC-19-0000658) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Upon review of the electronic pleadings record for the 
underlying case in circuit court criminal court case number 
1CPC-19-0000658, the Honorable Shirley M. Kawamura presiding, it 
appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction over this appeal by 
Defendant-Appellant Roberta Wilborn (Wilborn), pro se, from 
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawaii's (the State) April 29, 2019 
felony information and non-felony complaint charging Wilborn with 
(1) promoting a dangerous drug in the third degree in violation 
of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 712-1243 (2014) and 
(2) criminal trespass in the second degree in violation of 
HRS § 708-814 (Supp. 2018). 
"The right of appeal in a criminal case is purely 
statutory[.]"  State v. Nicol, 140
 Hawai# i 482, 485, 403 P.3d 
259, 262 (2017) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The law that allows appeals from circuit court criminal cases is NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRS § 641-11 (2016), which provides that "[a]ny party aggrieved 
by the judgment of a circuit court in a criminal matter may 
appeal to the intermediate appellate court, subject to chapter 
602, in the manner and within the time provided by the rules of 
court.  The sentence of the court in a criminal case shall be the 
judgment."  Thus, "[u]nder HRS § 641-11, the sentence of the 
court in a criminal case is the judgment from which an appeal is 
authorized[,]" and where "[t]here [is] no conviction and sentence 
in . . . [a] case, there can be no appeal under HRS § 641-11[.]" 
State v. Kealaiki, 95 Hawai‘i 309, 312, 22 P.3d 588, 591 (2001) 
(internal quotation marks and citations omitted); State v. 
Johnston, 63 Haw. 9, 11, 619 P.2d 1076, 1077 (1980) (Dismissing 
an appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction where a defendant 
had filed a notice of appeal from an order denying the 
defendant's motion to dismiss an indictment, even though the 
circuit court later entered a judgment with a sentence, because 
"such an order is interlocutory and is not a final order or 
judgment.  It is therefore not one that is appealable under HRS 
§ 641-11."); State v. Ferreira, 54 Haw. 485, 486-87, 510 P.2d 88, 
89 (1973) (Dismissing an appeal from a "judgment of conviction 
[that] does not include any sentence imposed upon the 
defendant[.]").  
In determining whether an order or judgment qualifies 
for appealability under HRS § 641-11, the Supreme Court of 
Hawai# i
 has "focused the inquiry on whether the relevant order 
terminated the proceedings in the case and left nothing further to be accomplished by the lower court."  Nicol, 140 Hawai# i
 at 
492, 403 P.3d at 269.  Consequently, in addition to authorizing an appeal from a judgment with a sentence, "HRS § 641-11 
authorizes a defendant's appeal in a criminal matter from a 
circuit court order dismissing the proceedings without 
prejudice."  Id. at 494, 403 P.3d at 271 (footnote omitted). 
In the instant case, the circuit court has not yet held 
a trial, nor has the circuit court entered judgment on or 
dismissed the State's felony information and non-felony

complaint.  In the absence of either a judgment of conviction 
with a sentence or an order dismissing the two charged crimes 
without prejudice, leaving nothing further to be accomplished, 
the underlying circuit court case is not yet eligible for 
appellate review.  Wilborn's appeal from the ongoing proceedings 
is premature, and we lack appellate jurisdiction. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED appellate court case 
number CAAP-19-0000390 is dismissed for lack of appellate 
jurisdiction.
