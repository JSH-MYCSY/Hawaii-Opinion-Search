(CASE NO. 2CC171000090)  
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: Nakasone, Presiding Judge, McCullen and Guidry, JJ.)  
These consolidated appeals arise out of litigation 
relating to a non -judicial foreclosure of real property (the 
Haʻikū property ) that was owned by self -represented 
Plaintiff /Counterclaim Defendant -Appellant Michael C. Greenspon 
(Greenspon ). In CAAP -19-0000391, Greenspon appeals from the

Upon careful review of the record and relevant legal 
authorities, and having given due consideration to the arguments 
advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve 
Greenspon's points of error5 as follows: 
(1) Greenspon contends that the circuit court erred by 
dismissing the second amended complaint, and in failing to find 
that it adequately alleged claims against AP for: (1) "fraud and 
tortious litigation conduct"; (2) "patently illegal activities"; 
(3) "abusive collections practices"; (4) participating in 
"unfair methods of competition"; and (5) participating in a 
"fraud on the market"  and "combination in restraint of trade in 
violation of [ Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes]  § 480-4[.]"

5 We have reordered and consolidated Greenspon's points of error in 
CAAP-19-0000391, and, with regard to CAAP -20-00000442, we limit our review to 
the dispositive point of error. See, infra, note 9.

"A circuit court's ruling on a motion to dismiss is 
reviewed de novo." Sierra Club v. Dep 't of Transp. , 115 Hawaiʻi 
299, 312, 167 P.3d 292, 30 5 (2007) (citation omitted). 
[A] complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state 
a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff 
can prove no set of facts in support of his or her claim 
that would entitle him or her to relief. The appellate 
court must therefore view a p laintiff's complaint in a 
light most favorable to him or her in order to determine 
whether the allegations contained therein could warrant 
relief under any alternative theory. For this reason, in 
reviewing a circuit court's order dismissing a complaint 
. . . the appellate court's consideration is strictly 
limited to the allegations of the complaint, and the 
appellate court must deem those allegations to be true. 
Bank of America, N.A. v. Reyes -Toledo, 143 Hawaiʻi 249, 257, 
428 P.3d 761, 769 (2018) (citation omitted) . 
Here, Greenspon contends that the circuit court erred 
in dismissing his claims against AP, which provided legal 
counsel to an opposing party, Cal -Western, during the underlying 
litigation.6 Hungate v. Law Off . of David B. Rosen , 139 Hawaiʻi 
394, 413, 391 P.3d 1, 20 (2017) (abrogated on other grounds by 
State ex rel. Shikada v. Bristol -Myers Squibb Co. , 152 Hawaiʻi 
418, 526 P.3d 395 (2023) ), is controlling. Hungate recognized 
that "absent special circumstances, attorneys owe no duty of 
care to non -clients." Id. at 405, 391 P.3d at 1 2. The Hungate 
court thus "declined to recognize a duty in favor of a plaintiff 
6 To the extent that Greenspon's allegations against AP arise from 
Cal-Western's alleged actions in the non -judicial foreclosure of the Haʻikū 
property, the record reflects that AP did not represent Cal -Western at the 
time of the non -judicial foreclosure. Cal -Western, which was dissolved in 
bankruptcy, is itself no longer a party to this action.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
adversely affected by an attorney's performance of legal 
services on behalf of the opposing party." Id. at 413, 391 P.3d 
at 20. 
Greenspon does not establish the basis, 
notwithstanding Hungate, for a statutory or other private right 
of action against an opposing party's legal counsel , based on 
actions taken by counsel in representing the opposing party's 
interests. The record reflects that Greenspon failed to state a 
claim against AP upon which relief could be granted, and the 
circuit court was not wrong in dismissing the claims agai nst AP. 
(2) Greenspon contends that the circuit court erred by 
denying Greenspon's motion to substitute AP for Cal -Western in 
the second amended complaint. We review the circuit court's 
ruling for abuse of discretion. See Price v. Coulson , No. CAAP -
17-0000609, 2019 WL 2417754, at * 3 (Haw. App. June 10, 2019) 
(SDO). Greenspon contends that , 
The circuit court erred by failing to find that [AP] used 
its dissolved former client, Defendant Cal -Western, as its 
alter-ego in its attempt to obstruct [Greenspon's] 
discovery and conceal its own liability for the acts 
alleged by [Greenspon's] [second amended complaint], and 
thus erred in denying [Greenspon's] HRCP Rule 25(c) motion 
to substitute [AP] for Cal -Western. 
AP's purported acquisition of Cal -Western assets 
during the bankruptcy proceedings does not , without more , make 
AP the "alter ego" of Cal -Western. "Generally speaking, the 
question whether a corporation is a mere agency, 
instrumentality, or alter ego of another corporation or 
6

individual is one of fact." Robert's Hawaii School Bus, Inc. v. 
Laupahoehoe Transp. Co., Inc., 91 Hawaiʻi 224, 238,  982 P.2d 853, 
867  (1999) (superseded by statute on other grounds,  citing 
1  William M. Fletcher, Fletcher Cyclopedia of the Law of Private 
Corporations § 41.95, at 699-705 (perm. ed. 1999)).  
In Calipjo v. Purdy , 144 Hawaiʻi 266, 439 P.3d 218 
(2019), the Hawai ʻi Supreme Court recognized that, 
Courts have identified a variety of factors to determine 
whether a corporate entity is the alter ego of another, 
though no single factor is dispositive. In addition, a 
two-part test must be satisfied:  
 
It must be made to appear that [1] the corporation is not 
only influenced and governed by that person, but that there 
is such a unity of interest . . . that the individuality, 
or separateness, of such person and corporation has ceased, and [2] that the facts are such that an adherence to the 
fiction of the separate existence of the corporation would, 
under the particular circumstances, sanction a fraud or 
promote injustice.  
Id. at 277, 439 P.3d at 229 ( cleaned up). Greenspon failed to 
present any evidence establishing that AP and Cal -Western shared 
a "unity of interest," such that maintaining a corporate fiction 
of AP and Cal -Western's "separate existence" would "sanction a 
fraud or promote injustice." As discusse d supra, the record 
reflects that AP's role in this litigation was solely to provide 
legal counsel for Cal -Western. AP, as legal counsel, and Cal -
Western, as the corporate client, were therefore separate 
entities. 
The circuit court did not err in denying Greenspon's 
motion to substitute AP for Cal -Western. 
7   
 
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(3) Greenspon contends that the circuit court erred by 
not holding an evidentiary hearing regarding his motion for 
reconsideration of the dismissal of his second amended 
complaint. "Decisions relating to the conduct of a trial or 
hearing and the adequacy of process usually involve the exercise 
of discretion, and thus warrant review under the abuse of 
discretion standard on appeal." TSA Int'l Ltd. v. Shimizu 
Corp., 92 Hawaiʻi 243, 252, 990 P.2d 713, 722 (1999). Greenspon 
has not alleged any new facts that would support his motion for 
reconsideration,  and the circuit court did not abuse its 
discretion in determining that, given the voluminous record of motions,  papers,  and exhibits, a further hearing would not be 
beneficial to the court's decision-making process. The circuit 
court therefore did not abuse its discretion in ruling on the 
motion for reconsideration without a hearing.  
(4) In CAAP-20-0000442, Greenspon contends that the 
circuit court erred in dismissing the second amended complaint, 
on grounds that Greenspon failed to comply with discovery rules 
and orders. We review the circuit court's dismissal of the 
second amended complaint for an abuse of discretion.  
The circuit court is given broad discretion in determining 
the sanctions to be imposed pursuant to HRCP Rule 37(b)(2). 
A trial court's imposition of a discovery abuse sanction is 
reviewable on appeal for abuse of discretion. A trial 
court abuses its disc retion whenever it exceeds the bounds 
of reason or disregards rules or principles of law or 
practice to the substantial detriment of a party.

Aloha Unlimited, Inc. v. Coughlin , 79 Hawaiʻi 527, 532 -33, 904 
P.2d 541, 546 -47 (App. 1995) (cleaned up). 
Pursuant to  HRCP  Rule 37, the circuit court may 
sanction a party for its willful disobedience with respect to 
discovery orders, including the issuance of an order "dismissing 
the action or proceeding or any part thereof, or rendering a judgment by default against the disobedient party[.]" HRCP 
37(b)(2)(C). In determining the appropriateness of dismissal, 
the court will consider: "(1) the public's interest in the 
expeditious resolution of litigation; (2) the court's need to 
manage its docket; (3) the risk of prejudice to the defendants; 
(4) the public policy favoring disposition of cases on their 
merits; and (5) the availability of less drastic sanctions."   
W.H. Shipman, Ltd. v. Hawaiian Holiday Macadamia Nut Co., Inc., 
8 Haw.  App. 354, 362, 802 P.2d 1203, 1207 (App. 1990).  
"Dismissal with prejudice is not an abuse of 
discretion when a plaintiff's deliberate delay or contumacious 
conduct causes actual prejudice." Erum v. Llego, 147 Hawai ʻi 
368, 382, 465 P.3d 815, 829 (2020) (citation omitted). In Erum  
the supreme court overturned the dismissal of appellant's 
complaint when appellant failed to appear at a pretrial 
conference. The supreme court held that,  
[W]henever a case is involuntarily dismissed with 
prejudice, the trial court must state essential findings on 
the record or make written findings as to deliberate delay 
or contumacious conduct and actual prejudice and explain

why a lesser sanction than dismissal with prejudice is 
insufficient to serve the interests of justice . 
Erum, 147 Hawaiʻi at 390, 465 P.3d at 837. 
This case is distinguishable from JK v. DK , 153 Hawaiʻi 
268, 533 P.3d 1215 (2023), which concluded, on the record of 
that case, that the trial court abused its discretion by 
entering a default judgment as a discovery sanction. Id. at 
278, 533 P.3d at 1225. Here, the discovery sanction against 
Greenspon was warranted; Greenspon was afforded multiple 
warnings that his noncompliance and contemptuous behavior would 
result in sanctions. 
The record reflects that the circuit court made 
extensive findings7 regarding Greenspon's contumacious conduct 
with respect to, inter alia , the site inspection of the Haʻikū 
property, and opposing counsel's attempts to depose him: 
The Site Inspection 
12. On or around May 15, 2017, Mr. Rosen noticed an 
inspection of the [Ha ʻikū] Property for June 14, 2017. The 
inspection did not occur that day. Efforts to reschedule 
7 In its May 18, 2020 Sanctions Order , the circuit court 
incorporated from Civil No. 2CC141000395 its May 18, 2020 Findings of Fact, 
Conclusions of Law, and Order Granting the Motion For Rule 37 Sanctions, 
filed by Defendants/Third -Party Defendants David B. Rosen, Esq. and the Law 
Office of David B. Rosen, and joined by CIT, against Greenspon (FOF/COL). 
Civil No. 2CC141000395 is a closely related case, involving the same parties; 
the findings of fact and conclusions of law reference the site inspection and 
Greenspon 's deposition, as discussed herein, that were part of Civ il No. 
2CC1710000090. 
As the FOF/COL have already been adopted and incorporated into 
the record of this case, we deny as unnecessary AP's request, filed on 
May 28, 2020, in CAAP -19-0000391, for this court to take judicial notice of 
the FOF/COL. We also deny AP's request for this court to take judicial 
notice of other orders filed in Civ. No. 2CC171000090 as unnecessary.

proved unsuccessful and futile because Mr. Greenspon 
refused to allow Mr. Rosen or counsel for CIT to inspect 
the [Haʻikū] Property. 
13. On September 11, 2018, Deutsche Bank moved in 
[2CC171000090] to compel an inspection of the [Haʻikū] 
Property. The Court granted the motion on December 21, 
2018, ordering that the inspection be permitted and that it 
occur between April 1 and April 30, 2019. 
14. On February 19, 2019, Mr. Greenspon moved for 
relief from the December 21, 2018 order and sought, among 
other things, to have the inspection scheduled for April 
15-19, 2019, April 29 -30, 2019, or August 1 -20, 2019. 
15. On February 22, 2019, the Court ordered that the 
site inspection occur on one of the dates requested by Mr. 
Greenspon. The Court entered a written order (the 
"[2CC171000090] Inspection Order") on March 14, 2019, 
directing, among other things, that "[e]ach party is 
permitted to have one (1) attorney and one (1) expert 
(e.g., a real estate consultant, an engineer or an 
appraiser) attend the Inspection." 
16. On July 1, 2019, CIT moved in this action for an 
inspection of the [Haʻikū] Property. The Court denied the 
motion but ordered that the [2CC171000090] Inspection Order 
would be effective in this action. 
17. At the August 5, 2019 hearing, the Court warned 
Mr. Greenspon that the inspection must occur, and there 
would be consequences, up to and including dismissal, if he 
failed to comply with the orders . 
18. Deutsche Bank made efforts to schedule the site 
inspection and, on August 16, 2019, informed Mr. Greenspon 
that it would occur on August 19, 2019. In a subsequent 
communication, Mr. Greenspon stated that he would not allow 
the inspection to occur on that date. The Court's clerk 
subsequently informed the parties that the August 19, 2019 
inspection would be canceled due to safety concerns, 
because Mr. Greenspon would not allow it to take place. 
19. On July 24, 2019, the Rosen Defendants moved for 
discovery relief, and on October 16, 2019, the Court 
entered an order (the "Consolidated Case Inspection Order") 
granting the motion in part and stating that the 
inspection: (a) would occur prior to Dece mber 31, 2019; and 
(b) shall be conducted, but for the presence of a special 
master, pursuant to the [2CC171000 090] Inspection Order. 
The Rosen Defendants noticed the inspection for 
December 19, 2019. 
20. The Consolidated Case Inspection Order and 
[2CC171000 090] Inspection Order permitted Mr. Rosen and 
attorneys for Defendants to attend the site inspection.

21. At a December 18, 2019 hearing, Mr. Greenspon 
requested a continuance of the site inspection. The Court 
denied the request, stated that it would occur as noticed, 
and warned Mr. Greenspon to comply with the inspection 
orders or face consequences. Mr . Greenspon responded to 
the Court that, irrespective of its order, he would NEVER 
allow the inspection. 
22. Late in the afternoon on December 18, 2019, Mr. 
Greenspon informed Mr. Rosen that he would not be permitted 
to participate in the site inspection. Plaintiff failed to 
present any evidence that Mr. Rosen threatened him 
regarding the [Haʻikū] Property. 
23. On December 19, 2019, Mr. Greenspon refused to 
allow CIT's counsel and one of Deutsche Bank's attorneys to 
participate in the site inspection. 
The Events of January 15, 2020 
25. On October 16, 2019, the Court ordered Mr. 
Greenspon to appear for his deposition between the dates of 
January 15 -31, 2020. 
26. On November 5, 2019, the Court ordered that Mr. 
Greenspon's deposition be conducted on January 15, 2020, 
beginning at 9:00 a.m. On or around January 6, 2020, the 
Rosen Defendants filed an amended notice for Mr. 
Greenspon's deposition for that date and time. 
27. On January 9, 2020, CIT filed and served its 
Designation of Alternative Method of Recording Deposition 
Testimony that provided, among other things, that Mr. 
Greenspon's deposition would be video recorded at CIT's 
sole cost and expense. 
28. Mr. Greenspon appeared approximately 19 minutes 
after the designated time that the Court set for the 
deposition [to] begin (9:19 am versus 9:00 am), refused to 
be sworn in, and would not proceed unless the video 
recording stopped. Mr. Greenspon exhibited clear and 
unequivocally hostile and verbally abusive conduct towards 
Mr. Rosen and CIT's counsel. Mr. Rosen and the court 
reporter, an innocent victim of the hostile and verbally 
abusive conduct, requested on multiple occasions that Mr. 
Greenspon not speak over counsel and to refrain from 
screaming. Ultimately, the record and video recording at 
one point reflects that the court reporter left the room 
and refused to further participate in the proceedings. 
29. Late in the morning of January 15, 2020, the 
Court conducted a status conference regarding the 
deposition. On the record at that conference, the Court 
stated that "[t]he deposition will proceed pursuant to the 
Court's order and pursuant to the notices that have been 
served."

30. After returning to the court reporter's office 
to resume the deposition, Mr. Greenspon continued to refuse 
to be video recorded. 
31. Mr. Greenspon then donned a mask. The mask that 
Mr. Greenspon wore had a clear photograph of CIT's 
counsel's face on it. There can be no mistake that the 
mask worn by Mr. Greenspon had no health benefits, pre -
dated any COVID -19 requirements, had to be the result of 
premeditated planning, and had the intent to disrupt the 
deposition proceedings. 
32. After Mr. Greenspon repeatedly disrupted the 
deposition, Mr. Rosen terminated the proceedings at 
approximately 12:20 p.m. 
(Emphasis in original ) (record citations omitted) . 
The above findings,  as supported by the record 
evidence, support the circuit court's conclusions that, inter 
alia,  8
6. . . . Mr. Greenspon has consistently violated 
orders requiring him to comply with discovery request s. He 
has unequivocally stated to the Court that he intends not 
to comply with said orders despite being advised of the 
potential consequences, including the dismissal of his 
actions. Thus, further motions practice would be useless 
because Mr. Greenspon cast a die of his own making. 
  
 . . .. 
7. . . . Mr. Greenspon's failure to follow [the 
circuit court's] orders, specifically as to the site 
inspection and his deposition, deprived the Remaining 
Defendants of information material to their defense of Mr. 
Greenspon's claims and damages, and that such actions 
constitute a sizeable threat to the rightful decisio n of 
this case. . . . 
 . . . . 
9. The Court concludes that: (a) despite having 
brought the remaining claims in these Consolidated Actions 
against the Remaining Defendants, Mr. Greenspon has 
wrongfully failed to provide and/or permit reasonable and 
material discovery requested by them a nd ordered by this 
Court; (b) Mr. Greenspon's actions caused delay; and (c)

Mr. Greenspon's conduct was willful, contumacious, and 
inexcusable. . . . 
 . . . . 
11. The Court has on multiple occasions warned Mr. 
Greenspon to comply with discovery orders or face 
sanctions, up to and including dismissal. Mr. Greenspon 
nevertheless violated the Court's orders as to the site 
inspection and deposition. He has demons trated a 
consistent contumacious and contentious attitude towards 
discovery in this action. The donning of a mask bearing 
the picture of an attorney in the case bears heavily on 
this Court's conclusion that it cannot guarantee the 
orderliness of proceedin gs or the continuing safety of 
those participating including court personnel. 
On this record, we conclude that the circuit court did 
not abuse its discretion in dismissing the second amended 
complaint.    9
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the circuit 
court's July 23, 2019 Rule 54(b) Judgment, and June 10, 2020 
Judgment.

9 Given our conclusion that the circuit court properly dismissed 
Greenspon's claims pursuant to HRCP Rule 37, we need not reach the additional 
points of error raised in CAAP -20-0000442.
