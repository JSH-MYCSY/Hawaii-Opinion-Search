IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
BRONSON GOUVEIA, Defendant-Appellant, and
LUKE J. WARNER, Interested Party-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CR. NO. 1CPC-18-002012) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By:  Reifurth, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record on appeal for the underlying 
case in circuit court criminal court case number 1CPC-18-0002012, 
it appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction under Hawaii 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-11(2016) to review this appeal by 
Non-Party/Appellant Luke J. Warner (Warner), pro se, from the 
Honorable Paul B.K. Wong's April 25, 2019 order denying Warner's 
motion to disqualify attorneys Michael Jay Green and Myles S. 
Breiner from representing Defendant-Appellee Bronson Gouveia 
(Gouveia) in Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawaii's (the State) 
prosecution against Gouveia for 
(1) attempted murder in the second decree in violation
of HRS § 707-701.5 (2014 & Supp 2018) and HRS§ 705-500 (2014), 
(2) ownership or possession of a prohibited firearm orammunition by a person convicted of certain crimesin violation of HRS § 134-7(b) (2011), and NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(3) carrying or using a firearm in the commission of a
separate felony in violation of HRS § 134-21(2011). 
"The right of appeal in a criminal case is purely 
statutory[.]"  State v. Nicol, 140 Hawai# i 482, 485, 403 P.3d 
259, 262 (2017) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
The law that allows appeals from circuit court criminal cases is 
HRS § 641-11, which provides that "[a]ny party aggrieved by the 
judgment of a circuit court in a criminal matter may appeal to 
the intermediate appellate court, subject to chapter 602, in the 
manner and within the time provided by the rules of court.  The 
sentence of the court in a criminal case shall be the judgment." 
In determining whether an order or judgment qualifies for 
appealability under HRS § 641-11, the Supreme Court of Hawai# i 
has "focused the inquiry on whether the relevant order terminated the proceedings in the case and left nothing further to be 
accomplished by the lower court."  Nicol, 140 
Hawai# i at 492, 403 
P.3d at 269.  Consequently, HRS § 641-11 authorizes an aggrieved party in a circuit court criminal case to appeal from either a 
judgment of conviction with a sentence or an order dismissing the 
proceedings without prejudice.  Nicol, 140 Hawai# i at 494, 403 
P.3d at 271. 
In the instant case, the circuit court has not yet held 
a trial, nor has the circuit court entered a judgment of conviction or order of dismissal as to the three-count indictment 
against Gouveia.  The April 25, 2019 order denying Warner's 
motion to disqualify Gouveia's attorneys is an interlocutory 
order that is not independently appealable.  Chuck v. St. Paul 
Fire and Marine Ins. Co., 61 Haw. 552, 556-57, 606 P.2d 1320, 
1323-24 (1980) (holding that an order granting a motion to 
disqualify counsel is not appealable as a matter of right).  
Accordingly, the April 25, 2019 order denying Warner's motion to 
disqualify Gouveia's attorneys is not an appealable order. 
Even if the April 25, 2019 order were appealable, 
Warner is a non-party who lacks standing to appeal from the 
underlying case. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Generally, the requirements of standing to appeal are: (1)
the person must first have been a party to the action; (2)the person seeking modification of the order or judgmentmust have had standing to oppose it in the trial court; and(3) such person must be aggrieved by the ruling, i.e., theperson must be one who is affected or prejudiced by theappealable order. 
Abaya v. Mantell, 112 Hawai# i 176, 181, 145 P.3d 719, 724 (2006) 
(citation, internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted; 
emphasis in original).  "In other words, non-parties, who did not 
or could not intervene, are ordinarily denied standing to 
appeal."  Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted; 
emphasis in original); see, e.g., State v. Nilsawit, 139 Hawai# i
 
86,94, 384 P.3d 862, 870 (2016) (Affirming the ICA's dismissal of an appeal by a non-party news agency, Hawaii News Now (HNN), from 
a criminal case because "HNN is not a party in this case, and" 
none of the applicable statutes "provide an independent source of 
appellate jurisdiction to the ICA.").  As a non-party in the 
State's prosecution against Gouveia in circuit court criminal 
case number 1CPC-18-0002012, Warner lacks standing to appeal. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED appellate court case 
number CAAP-19-0000392 is dismissed for lack of appellate 
jurisdiction.
