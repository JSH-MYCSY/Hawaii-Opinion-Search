APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 18-1-1659)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL
(By:  Chan, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.)
Upon review of the record, it appears that:
(1) On May 30, 2019, self-represented Defendant-
Appellant Virginia R. Marquardt (Marquardt) filed the notice of
appeal for herself and Defendant-Appellee APTI Holdings LLC (APTI
Holdings);
(2) On August 20, 2019, the court, among other things,
found the appeal is valid as to Marquardt only and not APTI
Holdings, because Marquardt is not a licensed attorney, and "non-
attorney agents are not allowed to represent corporations in
litigation."  Oahu Plumbing & Sheet Metal, Ltd. v. Kona Constr.,
Inc., 60 Haw. 372, 377, 590 P.2d 570, 574 (1979);

(5) On December 4, 2019, the appellate clerk notified
Marquardt that the time for filing the statement of jurisdiction
and opening brief had expired, the matter would be called to the
court's attention on December 16, 2019, for appropriate action,
which could include dismissal of the appeal, under Hawai#i Rules
of Appellate Procedure Rules 12.1(e) and 30, and Marquardt could
request relief from default by motion; and
(6) Marquardt took no further action in this appeal.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is
dismissed.
