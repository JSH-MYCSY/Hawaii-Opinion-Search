OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
DEBRA CANNOLES, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
TEACH FOR AMERICA AGENT: CORPORATE CREATIONS NETWORK INC.;
KIM ROWAN, Defendants-Appellees, 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
NORTH AND SOUTH HILO DIVISION
(CIVIL NO. 3RC-18-1-0515)
ORDER GRANTING JUNE 27, 2019 MOTION TO DISMISS
APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By:  Ginoza, C.J., Leonard and Hiraoka, JJ.)
Upon review of (1) Defendants-Appellees Teach for
America (Teach for America) and Kim Roman's (Roman) June 27, 2019
motion to dismiss appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction,
(2) the lack of any memorandum by Plaintiff-Appellant Debra H.
Cannoles (Cannoles), self-represented, in opposition to Teach for
America and Roman's June 27, 2019 motion, and (3) the record, it
appears that we do not have appellate jurisdiction over appellate
court case number CAAP-19-0000414.
Pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-1(a)
(2016),
appeals are allowed in civil matters from all final
judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit and district
courts.  In district court cases, a judgment includes any
order from which an appeal lies.  See District Court Rules
of Civil Procedure (DCRCP) Rule 54(a) (1996).  A final order
means an order ending the proceeding, leaving nothing
further to be accomplished. . . .  When a written judgment,
order, or decree ends the litigation by fully deciding all
rights and liabilities of all parties, leaving nothingNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
further to be adjudicated, the judgment, order, or decree is
final and appealable.
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai# i 425, 426, 984 P.2d 1251,
1252 (1999) (citations, internal quotation marks, and footnote
omitted; emphases added).  The Supreme Court of Hawai# i
has promulgated separate rules governing civil procedure in
the district courts . . . .  DCRCP Rule 58 (1996), in
contrast to HRCP Rule 58, does not by its plain language
require that judgment be set forth on a "separate document." 
Thus, the requirements set forth in Jenkins [v. Cades
Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai #i 115, 869 P.2d 1334
(1994)], are not applicable to district court cases. 
Consequently, an order that fully disposes of an action in
the district court may be final and appealable without the
entry of judgment on a separate document, as long as the
appealed order ends the litigation by fully deciding the
rights and liabilities of all parties and leaves nothing
further to be adjudicated.
Id. at 427, 984 P.2d at 1253 (footnote and citation omitted). 
In the instant case, the parties and the district court
resolved all of Cannoles's claims by way of a series of two
documents:
(1)a December 31, 2018 stipulation by all parties to
dismiss Cannoles's complaint as to Defendants-
Appellees Jill Baldemor and Alyson Emrick pursuant
to Rule 41(a)(1)(ii) of the District Court Rules
of Civil Procedure (DCRCP); and  
(2) a March 15, 2019 order granting Teach for America
and Roman's motion for summary against Cannoles as
to all claims in Cannoles's complaint.
The order that ended the litigation, leaving nothing further for
the district court to adjudicate, was the March 15, 2019 summary
judgment order.  Based on Casumpang, a subsequent judgment
document would have been superfluous for the purpose of
perfecting an aggrieved party's right to appeal.  Therefore, the
March 15, 2019 summary judgment order was an appealable final
order.
It appears that Cannoles did not file her May 31, 2019
notice of appeal within thirty days after entry of the March 15,
2019 summary judgment order, as Rule 4(a)(1) of the Hawai# i Rules
of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) required for a timely appeal from
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
the March 15, 2019 summary judgment order.  Therefore, Cannoles's
May 31, 2019 notice of appeal is untimely as to the March 15,
2019 summary judgment order.  The failure to file a timely notice
of appeal in a civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the
parties cannot waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in
the exercise of judicial discretion.  Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw.
648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o
court or judge or justice is authorized to change the
jurisdictional requirements contained in Rule 4 of these
rules.").
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Teach for
America and Roman's June 27, 2019 motion to dismiss appeal for
lack of appellate jurisdiction is granted.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, September 13, 2019.
