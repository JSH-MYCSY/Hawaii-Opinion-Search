ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that: 
(1)
 On March 6, 2020, the district court clerk filed 
the record on appeal, and the appellate clerk notified the parties that the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief were 
due on or before March 16, 2020, and April 15, 2020, 
respectively; 
(2) On March 10, 2020, the United States Postal Service 
returned the notice of entering case on calender with a label 
reflecting self-represented Defendant-Appellant Roberta Wilborn's 
(Wilborn) new address but also indicating the forwarding time had 
expired. That same day, the appellate clerk re-sent the notice 
of entering case on calendar to Wilborn's new address, and no 
return mail was received; 
(3) Wilborn failed to file the statement of 
jurisdiction and the opening brief, and did not request an 
extension of time; NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(4) On May 14, 2020, the appellate clerk notified 
Wilborn that the time for filing the statement of jurisdiction 
and opening brief had expired, the matter would be called to the 
court's attention on May 26, 2020, for appropriate action, which 
could include dismissal of the appeal, under Hawai# i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure Rules 12.1(e) and 30, and Wilborn could request relief from default by motion. The appellate clerk 
mailed the default notice to Wilborn's new address, and no return 
mail was received; and 
(5)
 Wilborn took no further action in this appeal. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed.
