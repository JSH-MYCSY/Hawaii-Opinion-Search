APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
H
ONOLULU DIVISION 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-19-01347) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Chan, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant John Hainrick (Hainrick) appeals 
from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and 
Plea/Judgment, filed on May 2, 2019, in the District Court of the
First Circuit, Honolulu Division (District Court).1  
After a bench trial, Hainrick was convicted of: (1) 
Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII),
in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1) 
(Supp. 2018);  and (2) Operating a vehicle after license and 2

2 HRS § 291E-61(a) states, in relevant part: 
§291E-61 Operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant. (a) A 
person commits the offense of operating a vehicle under the influence of an
intoxicant if the person operates or assumes actual physical control of avehicle:

privilege have been suspended or revoked for operating a vehicle 
under the influence of an intoxicant, in violation of HRS § 
291E-62(a)(1) and/or (a)(2) (Supp. 2018).3 
On appeal, Hainrick contends that there was 
insufficient evidence to support his OVUII conviction. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we 
resolve Hainrick's point of error as follows: 
Considering the evidence adduced at trial in the 
strongest light for the prosecution, we conclude that there was 
sufficient evidence to support Hainrick's OVUII conviction. See 
State v. Matavale, 115 Hawai# i 149, 157-58, 166 P.3d 322, 330-31 
(2007) ("[E]vidence adduced in the trial court must be considered 
in the strongest light for the prosecution when the appellate 
court passes on the legal sufficiency of such evidence to support 
a conviction; the same standard applies whether the case was 
before a judge or a jury. 
The test on appeal is not whether 
guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt, but whether there was substantial evidence to support the conclusion of the trier 
of fact). Specifically, we conclude that there was substantial 
evidence that Hainrick had operated a vehicle while under the 
(1) While under the influence of alcohol in an amount sufficient to 
impair the person's normal mental faculties or ability to care forthe person and guard against casualty[.] 
3 HRS § 291E-62(a) states, in relevant part: 
§ 291E-62 Operating a vehicle after license and privilege have been
suspended or revoked for operating a vehicle under the influence of an
intoxicant; penalties. (a) No person whose license and privilege to operate a
vehicle have been revoked, suspended, or otherwise restricted pursuant to this
section or to part III or section 291E-61 or 291E-61.5, or to part VII or partXIV of chapter 286 or section 200-81, 291-4, 291-4.4, 291-4.5, or 291-7 as thoseprovisions were in effect on December 31, 2001, shall operate or assume actualphysical control of any vehicle: 
(1) In violation of any restrictions placed on the person's license; 
(2) While the person's license or privilege to operate a vehicle remainssuspended or revoked[.]

influence of alcohol in an amount sufficient to impair his normal 
mental faculties or ability to care for himself and guard against 
casualty. See id. at 158, 166 P.3d at 331 ("'Substantial 
evidence' as to every material element of the offense charged is credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative 
value to enable [a person] of reasonable caution to support a 
conclusion. And as trier of fact, the trial judge is free to 
make all reasonable and rational inferences under the facts in 
evidence, including circumstantial evidence." (quoting State v. 
Batson, 73 Haw. 236, 248–49, 831 P.2d 924, 931 (1992)). 
At trial, Honolulu Police Department Officer Brennan 
Baysa (Officer Baysa) testified that, while driving westbound on 
the H-1 near the Kapiolani offramp, Hainrick quickly darted his 
vehicle over a solid yellow line and drifted back to the center 
of his lane of travel three separate times before being stopped. 
Officer Baysa then testified that upon initiating the traffic 
stop of Hainrick's vehicle, he asked Hainrick for identification 
and Hainrick fumbled through his vehicle opening up compartments 
for approximately two minutes and gave Officer Baysa several 
blank looks. After being asked multiple times for 
identification, Hainrick stated he did not have a driver's 
license. During this interaction, Officer Baysa stated that he 
observed Hainrick's eyes to be glossy and watery, and had 
detected an odor of an alcoholic beverage from Hainrick's breath. 
Officer Danilo Ting, Jr. (Officer Ting), who assisted Officer 
Baysa with the traffic stop, also testified that he noticed 
Hainrick's eyes were red, watery, and glassy when speaking with 
him. He could also smell a strong odor of alcohol from 
Hainrick's breath. Officer Ting informed Hainrick that there was 
reason to believe he was driving while impaired, then asked 
Hainrick to participate in the field sobriety test, to which 
Hainrick said "no." While speaking with Hainrick, Officer Ting 
also noted that Hainrick's responses were very short and it 
sometimes felt like Hainrick did not understand what Officer Ting 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
was saying. This was exemplified when, after refusing to 
participate in the field sobriety tests, Hainrick's blank stare 
caused Officer Ting to ask him if he understood what was just 
asked. Hainrick continued to stare and Officer Ting asked 
Hainrick to explain to him what he had asked Hainrick. Hainrick 
was still non-responsive to Officer Ting, so Officer Ting asked 
Hainrick if he understood what Officer Ting asked or to 
re-explain what Officer Ting had asked him. Hainrick did not 
respond, so Officer Ting asked him again to confirm if he wanted 
to participate in the field sobriety test, to which Hainrick 
again said "no." 
Consciousness of guilt may be inferred from a 
defendant's refusal to participate in the field sobriety tests. 
State v. Ferm, 94 Hawai# i 17, 29-30, 7 P.3d 193, 205-06 (App. 
2000). However, the trial court is also free to not construe such refusal as consciousness of guilt. State v. 
Kuahiwinui-Beck
, No. CAAP-15-0000683, 2017 WL 213156, at *3 (Haw. 
App. Jan. 18, 2017) (SDO). Here, the District Court expressly 
noted Hainrick's refusal to participate in the field sobriety 
tests in finding him guilty of OVUII, and therefore considered 
the refusal as consciousness of guilt. 
Considering the evidence adduced from the officers' 
testimonies and the inference from Hainrick's refusal to 
participate in field sobriety tests in the light most favorable 
for the prosecution, there was credible evidence adduced at trial 
which was of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a 
person of reasonable caution to conclude that Hainrick committed 
OVUII in violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1). See e.g.
, State v. 
Nakamitsu, 140 Hawai# i 157, 165, 398 P.3d 746, 754 (2017) 
(determining that even absent evidence of the defendant's 
performance on the field sobriety tests, the testimony of the two 
officers regarding the defendant's appearance, demeanor, and the 
defendant's vehicle and surrounding scene, was substantial 
evidence that he operated his vehicle under the influence of 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
alcohol in violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1)); State v. Gaston, 
108 Hawai# i 308, 310–11, 119 P.3d 616, 618–19 (App. 2005) 
(upholding defendant's OVUII conviction because evidence demonstrated that his face was flushed, his eyes were red and 
glassy, his breath had smelled of alcohol, he was unsteady on his 
feet, and he had lost control of his vehicle and hit a guardrail, 
which constituted substantial evidence). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of 
Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, filed on May 2, 
2019, in the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu 
Division, is affirmed.
