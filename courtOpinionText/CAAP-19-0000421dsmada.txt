IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI#I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
WILLIAM M. GILROY, also known as William of the Family Gilroy,
William Michael Gilroy, Jr., William Michael Gilroy, W.M. Gilroy,
and William Michael Gilroy, Jr., Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
(CASE NO. 3CPC-18-0000893)
ORDER
DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
AND
DISMISSING ALL PENDING MOTIONS AS MOOT 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
Upon review, it appears that we lack appellate
jurisdiction over Defendant-Appellant William M. Gilroy's
(Gilroy), self-represented, March 28, 2019 appeal from the
Honorable Melvin H. Fujino's March 22, 2019 interlocutory order
suspending proceedings for examination of Gilroy for fitness to
proceed under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) Chapter 704.  The
March 22, 2019 interlocutory order did not terminate the
proceedings for Plaintiff-Appellee State's amended complaint
against Gilroy for twenty-nine counts of unauthorized practice of
law in violation of HRS § 605-14 (2016), HRS § 605-15 (2016), HRS
§ 605-17 (2016), and HRS § 702-204 (2014).  Under these
circumstances, we lack appellate jurisdiction under HRS § 641-11NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(2016) and the holding in State v. Nicol, 140 Hawai#i 482, 492,
403 P.3d 259, 269 (2017).
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that CAAP-19-0000421 is
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions
in CAAP-19-0000421 are dismissed as moot.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai#i, September 26, 2019.
