LIONEL N. LIMA, JR., Claimant-Appellant/Appellant, v.

and ACCLAMATION INSURANCE MANAGEMENT SERVICES,

SPECIAL COMPENSATION FUND, Appellee-Appellee
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
(CASE NO. AB 2017-326(T); DCD NO. 2-03-08023)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By:  Leonard, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.)
Upon review of this appeal by self-represented
Claimant/Appellant/Appellant Lionel N. Lima, Jr. (Lima) from a
workers' compensation administrative matter, and the record, it
appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction.
Lima appeals from the following orders entered by the
Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board (LIRAB)  entered in
LIRAB Case No. AB 2017-326(T):1
(1)a March 4, 2019 "Order Regarding Matters
Heard by Hearings Officer"; and
1The LIRAB was comprised of members Melanie S. Matsui and Marie
C.L. Laderta; chair Danny J. Vasconcellos was recused.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(2)a May 1, 2019 "Order Granting Motion to
Continue and to Set Status Conference."
The Hawai#i Supreme Court has held:
The appeal of a decision or order of the LIRAB is
governed by HRS ยง 91-14(a), the statute authorizing appeals
in administrative agency cases.  HRS ยง 91-14(a) authorizes
judicial review of a final decision and order in a contested
case or a preliminary ruling of the nature that deferral of
review pending entry of a subsequent final decision would
deprive appellant of adequate relief.  For purposes of HRS
ยง 91-14(a), we have defined "final order" to mean an order
ending the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be
accomplished. . . .  Consequently, an order is not final if
the rights of a party involved remain undetermined or if the
matter is retained for further action.
Bocalbos v. Kapiolani Med. Ctr. for Women & Children, 89  Hawai#i
436, 439, 974 P.2d 1026, 1029 (1999) (citations and some internal
quotation marks omitted; emphasis added).
For example, "a decision that finally adjudicates the
matter of medical and temporary disability benefits is an
appealable final order under HRS ยง 91-14(a), even though the
matter of permanent disability has been left for later
determination."  Id. at 443, 974 P.2d at 1033.  In contrast, when
the LIRAB's determination of a claimant's workers' compensation
claim for benefits "has not been made[,] . . . the requisite
decree of finality is lacking with respect to th[e] case[,]" and
the appellate court lacks jurisdiction.  Mitchell v. State Dep't.
of Educ., 77 Hawai#i 305, 308, 884 P.2d 368, 371 (1994) (citation
omitted).
In this case, neither of the orders being appealed
finally adjudicated a benefit.  The March 4, 2019 "Order
Regarding Matters Heard by Hearings Officer" directed how this
matter would proceed following the LIRAB's appointment of a
hearing officer.  The May 1, 2019 "Order Granting Motion to
Continue and to Set Status Conference" reset the trial date of
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
March 8, 2019, to a later unspecified date, and scheduled a
status conference for May 21, 2019.  
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
case number CAAP-19-0000423 is dismissed for lack of appellate
jurisdiction.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, February 25, 2020.
