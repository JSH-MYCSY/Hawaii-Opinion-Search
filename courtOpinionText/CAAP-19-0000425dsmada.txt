(CASE NO. AB 2018-256; DCD NO. 2-03-09719)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.)
Upon review of this appeal by self-represented
Claimant-Appellant/Appellant Lionel N. Lima, Jr. ( Lima) from a
workers' compensation administrative matter, and the record, it
appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction.
Lima appeals from the following orders entered by the
Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board (LIRAB)  entered in
LIRAB Case No. AB 2018-256:1
(1)a January 14, 2019 order compelling Lima to
submit to an independent medical examination;
(2)a January 18, 2019 notice of non-hearing motion
regarding Lima's January 16, 2019 motion for
reconsideration of the January 14, 2019 order;

C.L. Laderta; chair Danny J. Vasconcellos was recused.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(3)a January 29, 2019 order granting in part and
denying in part Lima's January 16, 2019 motion for
reconsideration of the January 14, 2019 order;
(4)a May 1, 2019 notice of non-hearing motion
regarding Lima's April 11, 2019 motion to allow
Lima to complete an independent medical
examination with a dermatologist;
(5)a May 1, 2019 pretrial order that defined the two
issues for adjudication on the merits in LIRAB
Case No. AB 2018-256;
(6)a May 3, 2019 order holding LIRAB Case No. AB
2018-256 in abeyance as a result of Lima's refusal
to comply with the LIRAB's January 14, 2019 order
compelling Lima to submit to an independent
medical examination;
(7)a May 8, 2019 order denying, as moot, Employer/
Appellee/Appellee Safety National-Work Comp HI-
Wailuna Recreation Association's April 18, 2019
motion for stay of proceedings to enforce the
January 29, 2019 order; and
(8)a May 15, 2019 order denying Lima's April 11, 2019
motion to allow Lima to complete an independent
medical examination with a dermatologist.
The Hawai#i Supreme Court has held:
The appeal of a decision or order of the LIRAB is
governed by HRS ยง 91-14(a), the statute authorizing appeals
in administrative agency cases.  HRS ยง 91-14(a) authorizes
judicial review of a final decision and order in a contested
case or a preliminary ruling of the nature that deferral of
review pending entry of a subsequent final decision would
deprive appellant of adequate relief.  For purposes of HRS
ยง 91-14(a), we have defined "final order" to mean an order
ending the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be
accomplished. . . .  Consequently, an order is not final if
the rights of a party involved remain undetermined or if the
matter is retained for further action.

436, 439, 974 P.2d 1026, 1029 (1999) (citations and some internal
quotation marks omitted; emphasis added).
For example, "a decision that finally adjudicates the
matter of medical and temporary disability benefits is an appeal-
able final order under HRS ยง 91-14(a), even though the matter of
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
permanent disability has been left for later determination."  Id.
at 443, 974 P.2d at 1033.  In contrast, when the LIRAB's deter-
mination of a claimant's workers' compensation claim for benefits
"has not been made[,] . . . the requisite decree of finality is
lacking with respect to th[e] case[,]" and the appellate court
lacks jurisdiction.  Mitchell v. State Dep't. of Educ., 77
Hawai#i 305, 308, 884 P.2d 368, 371 (1994) (citation omitted).
In this case, none of the orders being appealed finally
adjudicated a benefit.  Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that
appellate court case number CAAP-19-0000425 is dismissed for lack
of appellate jurisdiction.
