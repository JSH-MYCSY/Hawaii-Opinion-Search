OF THE STATE OF HAWAIʻ I 
WANDA L. LEOPOLDINO, Claimant-Appellant-Appellant, v. 
STATE OF HAWAIʻ I, DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, 
Employer-Appellee/Self-Insured-Appellee. 
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD 
(CASE NO. AB 2015-463(H)(T)(1-08-10021))  
 
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka and McCullen, JJ.) 
 
 Claimant-Appellant-Appellant Wanda L. Leopoldino 
(Leopoldino) appeals from the Labor and Industrial Relations 
Appeals Board's (Board) May 14, 2019 Decision and Order. In her 
points of error, Leopoldino challenges several findings of fact ( ) and a conclusion of law ( ). 
FOF COL
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve the 
points of error as discussed below.   
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Specifically, Leopoldino challenges FOF numbers 3, 4, 
5, 7, and 8, and COL number 1. FOF numbers 3, 4, 5, and 7 made 
credibility determinations, which we will not disturb. See
generally, Pave v. Prod. Processing, Inc., 152 Hawaiʻ i 164, 172, 
524 P.3d 355, 363 (App. 2022) (holding when reviewing FOF, this 
court "cannot consider the weight of the evidence to ascertain 
whether it weighs in favor of the administrative findings, or 
review the agency's findings of fact by passing upon the 
credibility of witnesses or conflicts in testimony . . . .") 
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
FOF number 8 and COL number 1 are related, and state: 
FOF 8
: "The Board finds that [Leopoldino] has not 
met her burden of proving that she sustained 
[permanent partial disability] as a result of her October 25, 2007 work injury." 
COL 1: "The Board concludes that [Leopoldino] 
sustained no permanent partial disability as a result of the work injury of October 25, 
2007." 
(Emphases added.) The issue before the Board was whether 
Leopoldino "sustained any permanent partial disability as a result of the work injury of October 25, 2007. If so, what is 
the extent of permanent partial disability." (Emphasis added.)  
The Board relied on Hawai‘ i Revise
d Statutes (HRS) 
§ 91-10(5) (2012), under the Administrative Procedure chapter, 
2   
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
which provides "[e]xcept as otherwise provided by law, the party 
initiating the proceeding shall have the burden of proof, 
including the burden of producing evidence as well as the burden 
of persuasion. The degree or quantum of proof shall be a 
preponderance of the evidence." (Emphasis added.) 
HRS chapter 386, the Workers' Compensation Law, 
otherwise provides in part, "[i]n any proceeding for enforcement 
of a claim for compensation under this chapter it shall be presumed, in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary 
. . . [t]hat the claim is for a covered work injury[.]" HRS 
§ 386-85(1) (2015). 
The HRS § 386-85(1) presumption applies "in any 
proceeding for compensation due to an allegedly compensable 
consequence of a work-related injury." Igawa v. Koa House
Rest.
, 97 Hawai‘i 402, 407, 38 P.3d 570, 575 (2001) (holding the 
presumption applied where the "issue before the Board was not 
merely whether and to what extent Claimant was permanently 
disabled, but also whether the disability was a result of the 
work injury"). "In order to overcome the HRS § 386-85(1) presumption of work-relatedness, the employer must introduce 
substantial evidence to the contrary." 
Id.
In 
Igawa, the director awarded the claimant temporary 
total disability, "but stated that permanent disability and 
disfigurement benefits, if any, would be determined at a later 
3   
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
date." Id. at 404, 38 P.3d at 572. Two years later, the 
director held a hearing, and issued a decision discussing in 
part, permanent disability. Id.The employer appealed to the 
Board, who framed the permanent disability issue as, "[w]hat is the extent of permanent disability resulting from the work 
injury[.]" Id.The Board concluded the claimant "did not 
sustain any permanent disability attributable to his October 3, 1991 work injury[.]" Id. at 405, 38 P.3d at 573. This court 
however held that the Board erred because under HRS § 386-85(1), 
the employer had the burden to rebut the presumption the 
claimant suffered permanent partial disability as a result of 
the work injury. Id.
On certiorari to the Hawai‘ i Supreme Court, the 
employer argued because the director's earlier "decision already 
established that Claimant's injury arose out of and in the 
course of his employment, the [HRS § 386-85] presumptions did 
not apply." Id. at 406, 38 P.3d at 574. The supreme court 
disagreed, and explained the "issue before the Board was not merely whether and to what extent Claimant was permanently disabled, but also whether the disability was a result of the 
work injury." Id. at 407, 38 P.3d at 575. "Thus, whether the 
cause of Claimant's permanent disability was work-related was clearly at issue in the proceedings and the HRS § 386-85 
presumptions applied." Id.
4   
 
   
  
 
 
   
  
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Like Igawa, the issue of permanent partial disability 
here was deferred to a later date. Id. at 404, 38 P.3d at 572. 
Also like Igawa, in finally addressing permanent partial 
disability, the "issue before the Board was not merely whether 
and to what extent Claimant was permanently disabled, but also 
whether the disability was a result of the work injury." Igawa, 
97 Hawai‘ i at 407, 38 P.3d at 575.  Further, FOF number 8 and COL 
number 1 in the Board's May 14, 2019 Decision and Order did not 
stop at whether disability existed, but determined whether the 
disability was work related. 
Thus, the HRS § 386-85(1) 
presumption applied, and the Board erred in applying the HRS § 91-10(5) burden of proof.

Based on the foregoing, we vacate the Board's May 14, 
2019 Decision and Order, and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this summary disposition order.

1 In its answering brief, the employer, the State of Hawai‘i Department 
of Education, does not argue it adduced substantial credible evidence that 
Leopoldino did not suffer any permanent impairment as a result of the work 
accident; thus, we do not address this issue. See generally
