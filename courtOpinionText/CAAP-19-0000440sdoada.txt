Respondents-Appellants Estelle Mayumi Araki and Derik 
Koichi Araki appeal from three orders and a judgment entered by 
the Circuit Court of the First Circuit,  sitting in probate 
(Probate Court
). For the reasons explained below, we vacate and 
remand for further proceedings.21
Edward G. Araki died on December 31, 2016. He was 
married to Respondent-Appellee Michiyo  Araki. Michiyo had two

daughters from a prior marriage — Petitioner-Appellee Beth Anne 
Matsukawa and Respondent-Appellee Dawn Marie Bacon — whom Edward 
treated as his own children. Estelle and Derik are Edward's 
children from a prior marriage. Estelle and Derik had no contact with Edward after their parents' divorce, when they were approximately two and five years of age, respectively.
3 
Edward had a Will, dated September 23, 2016.4 On 
March 19, 2018, Beth initiated a proceeding by filing an application for informal probate of the Will and appointment of personal representative. Estelle and Derik filed an objection. They challenged Edward's testamentary capacity and alleged undue influence by Beth and Dawn. 
On May 9, 2018, Beth filed a petition for formal 
probate of the Will and appointment of personal representative. Michiyo and Dawn each filed joinders in Beth's petition. Estelle and Derik filed an objection. They again challenged Edward's testamentary capacity and alleged undue influence by Beth and Dawn. Beth filed a response. Dawn filed a response. Estelle and Derik filed two supplemental memoranda. The Probate Court did not enter an order of assignment under Rule 20(a) of the Hawai#i Probate Rules (HPR). 
The petition was heard on April 11, 2019. On May 17, 
2019, the Probate Court entered the "Order Granting Petition for 
Probate of Will and Appointment of Personal Representative[.]" 
The Will was admitted to probate and Beth was appointed personal representative of Edward's estate. The "Judgment Pursuant to 
Order Granting Petition for Probate of Will and Appointment of 
Personal Representative" was also entered on May 17, 2019. Estelle and Derik filed a notice of appeal on June 16, 2019, creating CAAP-19-0000440. On August 5, 2019, the Probate Court entered its "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Decision

and Order Granting Petition for Probate of Will and Appointment 
of Personal Representative, Filed May 9, 2018." 
Meanwhile, on May 28, 2019, Estelle and Derik filed a 
motion to alter the Order Granting Petition and the Judgment. 
The motion sought, among other things, an order of assignment to the civil trials calendar. They filed an amended and restated petition on their motion on June 13, 2019. Beth and Dawn filed an objection. The motion was heard on September 5, 2019. On October 11, 2019, the Probate Court entered its order granting in part and denying in part the amended and restated petition (Order 
on Reconsideration). The court ordered that the real property 
located in # Aiea could be conveyed to Dawn, but may not be sold 
until the final disposition of the pending appeal. 
The motion 
was otherwise denied. Estelle and Derik filed a notice of appeal 
on November 8, 2019, creating CAAP-19-0000793. We consolidated the appeals. 
Estelle and Derik raise a number of points on appeal, 
but one is dispositive. They argue that the Probate Court erred by failing to follow the procedure prescribed by HPR Rule 20. HPR Rule 20 provides, in relevant part: 
DISPOSITION OF CONTESTED MATTERS . 
(a) Assignment . The court by written order may retain
a contested matter on the regular probate calendar or may
assign the contested matter to the civil trials calendar ofthe circuit court.[
5] 
. . . . 
(c) Effect of Assignment to Civil Trials Calendar . 
The Hawai #i Rules of Civil Procedure and the Rules of the 
Circuit Courts will apply to all contested matters assignedto the civil trials calendar. 
However, no right to jury
trial shall be created by assignment to the civil trialscalendar where such a right does not exist in the underlyingproceeding. Unless otherwise ordered by the court, when amatter is assigned to the civil trials calendar, then forall procedural purposes, the party objecting to the petitionshall be considered the plaintiff, the objection is to be 
5 The commentary to HPR Rule 20(a) states: "By requiring a written
order of assignment, which would ideally be a preprinted form, a clear recordis created, and the court then has the opportunity to decide what procedureswill be used if the contested matter is retained. (See Rule (d) below.)" 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
treated as a complaint, and the complaint shall be deemed to
have been filed on the date of the assignment to the civiltrials calendar. 
(d) Procedures in Retained Contested Matters . 
Whenever the court retains jurisdiction of a contestedmatter as a probate proceeding, the court in the order ofassignment may, at the request of the parties, designate andorder that any one or more of the Hawai #i Rules of Civil 
Procedure and/or the Rules of the Circuit Courts shall beapplicable in such matter. 
"A contested matter is any one in which an objection 
has been filed." HPR Rule 19. Beth's application for formal 
probate was a contested matter. The Probate Court did not entera written order of retention or assignment under HPR Rule 20(a).Dawn argues that the Probate Court wasn't required to enter a   
written order of retention or assignment, citing In re Est. of Kam, 110 Hawai# i 8, 129 P.3d 511 (2006). Kam stands for the 
proposition that the probate court has discretion whether to retain a contested matter or assign it to the civil trials calendar. Id. at 24, 129 P.3d at 527. The supreme court did not 
reach the issue of whether a written order was required under HPR Rule 20(a). 
The latter issue was addressed in In re Elaine Emma 
Short Revocable Living Tr. Agreement Dated July 17, 1984, 147 Hawai#i 456, 465 P.3d 903 (2020), which was issued after the 
appeals were taken in this case. The supreme court held that 
when a case is contested the probate court must, through a
written order , either assign the case to the circuit court
or retain it. HPR Rule 20(a). . . . [I]f the probate court
retains the case, the probate court "in the order ofassignment may, at the request of the parties, designate andorder that any one or more of the Hawai #i Rules of Civil 
Procedure and/or the Rules of the Circuit Courts shall beapplicable in such matter." 
HPR Rule 20(d). Although the
probate court is not obligated to adopt any and all rulesthat the parties request, it must exercise its discretion todo so "with regard to what is right and equitable under thecircumstances and the law." Booker v. Midpac Lumber Co., 65
Haw. 166, 172, 649 P.2d 376, 380 (1982) (quoting 
Langnes v.
Green, 282 U.S. 531, 541, 51 S.Ct. 243, 75 L.Ed. 520(1931)). 
Id. at 468–69, 465 P.3d at 915–16 (emphasis added) (footnotes 
omitted).

Dawn argues that Estelle and Derik waived their 
argument because they didn't raise the issue before the April 11, 
2019 hearing on Beth's petition for formal probate. Their objection to Beth's petition, however, requested "that discovery be allowed so that . . . Estelle Araki and Derik Araki can obtain further information as to the facts and circumstances as to Edward Araki's physical and medical condition and his state of mind and the circumstances surrounding the execution of his Will[.]" The Probate Court would have had to address that request in a written order of retention or assignment. In re Tr. 
Agreement Dated June 6, 1974, 145 Hawai# i 300, 308, 452 P.3d 297, 
311 (2019). 
"After the designation of assignment, if the party 
wishes to conduct discovery, it must request that discovery be taken." Id. (citing HPR Rule 20(d)); 
cf. In re Elaine Emma 
Short, 147 Hawai# i at 469, 465 P.3d at 916 (noting that because 
probate court "did not issue an order retaining the case in contravention of HPR Rule 20(a) . . . , the parties were not provided an opportunity under HPR Rule 20(d) to request that the probate court adopt HRCP Rule 52 and render findings of fact at the time an order of retention should have been issued"). 
In 
addition, Estelle and Derik's supplemental memorandum in support of their objection to Beth's petition stated: 
we respectfully request that the Court grant Respondents'
request to assign this case/probate as an adversarialproceeding in order to allow Respondents an opportunity toconduct discovery and obtain additional informationincluding, but not limited to, Edward Araki's medicalrecords that would likely reveal the extent and effect ofEdward Araki's pain medications and possibly Mr. Araki'sstate of mind and to obtain further medical evaluation from Dr. Marvit. 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the Probate 
Court's: Order Granting Petition and Judgment, both entered on 
May 17, 2019; Decision and Order Granting Petition, entered on August 5, 2019; and Order Denying Reconsideration, entered on October 11, 2019; and remand for further proceedings. On remand, the Probate Court should enter a written order pursuant to HPR

Rule 20. We express no opinion about whether the Probate Court 
abused its discretion by its de facto retention of Beth's petition.
