ROBINSON FAMILY PARTNERS, Plaintiff-Appellee, v. UNKNOWN HEIRS OR
ASSIGNS OF KAILAA, Defendant-Appellee, ROSE KAWAILEHUA KOMOMUA
SANBORN; LANCE KAMUELA GOMES, PUNOHU NALIMU KEKAUALUA III, and
NOA KANEALIIOPONOI MAU-ESPIRITO, Defendants-Appellants
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 18-1-0154)
ORDER GRANTING AUGUST 12, 2019 MOTION TO
DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Hiraoka, JJ.)
Upon review of (1) Plaintiff-Appellee Robinson Family
Partners' (Robinson Family Partners) August 12, 2019 motion to
dismiss case number CAAP-19-0000445 for lack of appellate
jurisdiction, (2) the lack of any opposition by Defendants-
Appellants Rose Kawailehua Komomua Sanborn (Sanborn) and Ponohu
Nalimu Kekaualua III (Kekaualua) to Robinson Family Partners'
August 12, 2019 motion, and (3) the record, it appears that we
lack appellate jurisdiction over Sanborn and Kekaualua's appeal
from two interlocutory orders that the Honorable Randal G.B.
Valenciano entered on March 28 and May 29, 2019, in Civil No. 18-
1-0154, because the circuit court has not yet adjudicated all of
the claims in the case or entered an appealable final judgment.  
Pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") ยง 641-1(a)
(2016) and Rule 58 of the Hawai#i Rules of Civil Procedure
(HRCP), an aggrieved party may appeal from a civil circuit courtNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
"only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the
judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate
parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]"  Jenkins v. Cades Schutte
Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai#i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338
(1994).  The March 28 and May 29, 2019 orders are interlocutory,
and the record shows that the circuit court is not yet ready to
enter final judgment on all claims as to all parties in Civil No.
18-1-0154, or an appealable judgment under HRCP Rule 54(b).
 Although exceptions to the final judgment requirement
exist under the doctrine in Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848)
(the Forgay doctrine), the collateral order doctrine, and HRS
ยง 641-1(b) (2016), the March 28 and May 29, 2019 orders do not
satisfy the requirements for appealability under the Forgay
doctrine, the collateral order doctrine, or HRS ยง 641-1(b).  See
Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai# i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995)
(regarding the two requirements for appealability under the
Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88
Hawai#i 319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding the three
requirements for the collateral order doctrine); HRS ยง 641-1(b)
(regarding the requirements for an appeal from an interlocutory
order).  Absent an appealable final judgment, we lack appellate
jurisdiction over case number CAAP-19-0000445.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Robinson Family
Partners' August 12, 2019 motion to dismiss case number CAAP-19-
0000445 is granted, and case number CAAP-19-0000445 is dismissed
for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, October 15, 2019.
