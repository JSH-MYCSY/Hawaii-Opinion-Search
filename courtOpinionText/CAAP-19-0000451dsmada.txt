A
PPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 14-1-0664(1))
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
AND DISMISSING ALL PENDING MOTIONS AS MOOT
(By:  Fujise, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.)
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
appellate jurisdiction over Defendant-Appellant Peter K. Martin's
(Martin) appeal from the Honorable Rhonda I.L. Loo's 
• May 31, 2019 judgment, and 
• August 1, 2019 order granting Plaintiffs-Appellees
Tim Uzzanti and Katrina Uzzanti's (the Uzzantis)
motion for attorneys' fees and costs against
Martin
in Civil No. 14-1-0664(1) pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes
(HRS) § 641-1(a) (2016) because the May 31, 2019 judgment(a) lacks sufficient specificity, (b) does not resolve all claims
as to all parties, and (c) does not contain a finding of "no just
reason for delay" in the entry of judgment as to one or more but
fewer than all claims or parties pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the
Hawai#i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP).
Based on HRS § 641-1(a) and HRCP Rule 58, "[a]n appeal
may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a
judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and
against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" 
Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai#i 115, 119,
869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994).  "Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP
Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all
claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a
separate judgment."  Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai# i 245,
254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008); Bailey v. DuVauchelle, 135
Hawai#i 482, 489, 353 P.3d 1024, 1031 (2015).
[I]f a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a case
involving multiple claims or multiple parties, the judgment
(a)  must specifically identify the party or parties for and
against whom the judgment is entered, and (b) must
(i) identify the claims for which it is entered, and
(ii) dismiss any claims not specifically identified[.]
Jenkins, 76 Hawai# i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (emphases added). 
"For example: 'Pursuant to the jury verdict entered on (date),
judgment in the amount of $___ is hereby entered in favor of
Plaintiff X and against Defendant Y upon counts I through IV of
the complaint."  Id. at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4
(internal quotation marks omitted).  "[A]n appeal from any
judgment will be dismissed as premature if the judgment does not,
on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties or
contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP
[Rule] 54(b)."  Id. at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (original emphasis).
Although the Uzzantis asserted seventeen separately
enumerated counts in their November 21, 2014 complaint, the
May 31, 2019 judgment vaguely enters judgment in favor of the
Uzzantis and against Martin, only, without specifically
2identifying the claim or claims on which the circuit court
intends to enter judgment against Martin, in violation of the
requirements for an appealable final judgment in Jenkins. 
Although HRCP Rule 54(a) provides that "[a] judgment shall not
contain a recital of pleadings, . . . or the record of prior
proceedings[,]" the May 31, 2019 judgment recites four prior
interlocutory orders in an apparent attempt to resolve the claims
to which those orders refer.  However, references to prior orders
do not resolve claims in a judgment, and when, as here, the
judgment does not, on its face, resolve all claims as to all
parties, the judgment must contain the finding necessary for
certification under HRCP Rule 54(b).
Granted, the May 31, 2019 judgment does not need to
enter judgment on or dismiss the Uzzantis' claims as to
Defendants-Appellees Elite Pacific Properties, LLC, Debbie
Arakaki and Greg Burns, because on February 2, 2018, all parties
who appeared in this case stipulated to dismiss all claims as to
those parties pursuant to HRCP Rule 41(a)(1)(B), and the Supreme
Court of Hawai#i "hold[s] that a separate judgment is neither
required nor authorized, inasmuch as a plaintiff’s dismissal of
an action, by filing a stipulation of dismissal signed by all
parties, is effective without order of the court.  See HRCP Rule
41(a)."  Amantiad v. Odum, 90 Hawai#i 152, 158 n.7, 977 P.2d 160,
166 n.7 (1999) (internal quotation marks and original brackets
omitted).).  But the May 31, 2019 judgment fails to adequately
resolve the other remaining claims that the February 2, 2018 HRCP
Rule 41(a)(1)(B) stipulation to dismiss did not resolve. 
The circuit court "DENIED[,]" and, thus, rejected the
parties' July 24, 2018 HRCP Rule 41(a)(1)(B) stipulation to
dismiss the Uzzantis' claims as to Defendants-Appellees Andrew
Keenan, Vanessa Keenan and K&S Construction, LLC (K&S), which was
not signed by all parties who have appeared in the action, in
violation of the requirement that a "stipulation of dismissal"
must be "signed by all parties who have appeared in the
3action[.]"  HRCP Rule 41(a)(1)(B).  Neither the circuit court nor
the parties have otherwise resolved all of the Uzzantis' claims
as to Andrew Keenan, Vanessa Keenan and K&S.  Although the
circuit court entered a May 25, 2018 order granting Andrew
Keenan, Vanessa Keenan and K&S's petition for determination of
good faith settlement pursuant to HRS § 663-15.5 (2016), that
May 25, 2018 order did not dismiss all of the Uzzantis' claims
against them, and some of those claims remain pending and
unresolved before the circuit court.  Even if the May 25, 2018
order had dismissed all of those claims (which it did not), the
circuit court would still be obligated to reduce all orders of
dismissal to the separate judgment.  The May 31, 2019 judgment
does not resolve those claims.  
Although the May 31, 2019 judgment does not resolve all
claims as to all parties, the May 31, 2019 judgment does not
contain the necessary express finding of "no just reason for
delay" in the entry of judgment as to one or more but fewer than
all claims or parties pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b).  Although the
May 31, 2019 judgment concludes with a statement that "there are
no remaining claims or parties in this action," the Supreme Court
of Hawai# i has explained that
[a] statement that declares "there are no other outstanding
claims" is not a judgment.  If the circuit court intends
that claims other than those listed in the judgment language
should be dismissed, it must say so: for example,
"Defendant Y's counterclaim is dismissed," or "Judgment upon
Defendant Y's counterclaim is entered in favor of
Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all other claims,
counterclaims, and cross-claims are dismissed."
Jenkins. 76 Hawai# i at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4
(emphases added).  In the absence of (1) sufficient specificity
and (2) the finding necessary for certification under HRCP
Rule 54(b), the May 31, 2019 judgment fails to satisfy the
requirements in Jenkins for an appealable final judgment.
Although Martin asserted a separate appeal from a
subsequent August 1, 2019 post-judgment order granting the
Uzzantis' June 17, 2019 HRCP Rule 54(d)(2)(B) motion for an award
4of attorneys' fees and costs against Martin, Hawai#i appellate
courts have consistently held that "[a]bsent entry of an
appealable final judgment on the claims . . . [to which an award
of attorneys' fees and costs relates], the award of attorneys'
fees and costs is . . . not appealable."  Fujimoto v. Au, 95
Hawai#i 116, 123, 19 P.3d 699, 706 (2001); CRSC, Inc. v. Sage
Diamond Co., Inc., 95 Hawai#i 301, 306, 22 P.3d 97, 102 (App.
2001) ("Similarly, the September 23, 1999 Order [awarding only
attorneys' fees] and the February 3, 2000 Judgment [awarding only
attorneys' fees] are not appealable, and we do not have appellate
jurisdiction to review them."); cf. Bailey, 135 Hawai#i at 483-
84, 353 P.3d at 1025-26 (holding that an order deciding a motion
that was purportedly filed pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b) is not an
appealable post-judgment order "where the underlying ruling from
which the party sought [HRCP] Rule 60(b) relief was not
appealable.").  Absent an appealable final judgment, we lack
appellate jurisdiction over all of Martin's appeals.1
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
case number CAAP-19-0000451 is dismissed for lack of appellate
jurisdiction.
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions
are dismissed as moot.

1Although remands for the entry of amended judgments are sometimes
warranted under HRS § 602-57(3) (2016) and the holding in State v. Joshua, 141
Hawai#i 91, 93, 405 P.3d 527, 529 (2017), the instant appeal does not seem
appropriate for such a remand, because some of the Uzzanti Plaintiffs'
seventeen-count complaint remains pending and unresolved as to Andrew Keenan,
Vanessa Keenan and K&S, and we are reluctant to interfere with the circuit
court's adjudication of the remaining claims.
