NO. CAAP-19-0000455
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
IN THE MATTER OF THE ESTATE OF BONNIE J. GREEN
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(PROBATE NO. 17-1-0066)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL
(By:  Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Hiroka, JJ.)
Petitioner-Appellant Julie A. Berschauer (Berschauer)
purports to appeal from the Amended Final Judgment  entered by the
Circuit Court of the First Circuit in P. No. 17-1-0066 (JHA) on
December 31, 2019.
[I]f a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a case
involving multiple claims or multiple parties, the judgment
(a) must specifically identify the party or parties for and
against whom the judgment is entered, and (b) must
(i) identify the claims for which it is entered, and
(ii) dismiss any claims not specifically identified; (3) if
the judgment resolves fewer than all claims against all
parties, or reserves any claim for later action by the
court, an appeal may be taken only if the judgment contains
the language necessary for certification under HRCP 54(b)[.]
Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai#i 115, 119,
869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994) (underscoring added).  The Amended
Final Judgment is based upon Berschauer's First Amended
Complaint , filed on December 7, 2018, but it does not, on its
face, resolve the claims against respondents Bank of Hawaii or
the estate of Bonnie Green that are alleged in the First AmendedNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Complaint.  Nor does it "dismiss any claims not specifically
identified[.]"  The Amended Final Judgment does not contain the
language necessary for certification under Hawai# i Rules of Civil
Procedure ( HRCP) Rule 54(b).  "[A]n appeal from any judgment will
be dismissed as premature if the judgment does not, on its face,
either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the
finding necessary for certification under HRCP 54(b)."  Id. 
Therefore, this appeal is dismissed for lack of
jurisdiction.  All pending motions are dismissed.
