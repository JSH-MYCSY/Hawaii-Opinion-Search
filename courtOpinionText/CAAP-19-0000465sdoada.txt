HAWAI# I  
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v. 
MICAH VASCONCELLOS, Defendant-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
HONOLULU DIVISION 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-18-02776) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Plaintiff-Appellant State of 
Hawai# i (State) appeals 
from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and 
Plea/Judgment (Judgment), filed on May 28, 2019, in the District 
Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division (district court),1 
which granted Defendant-Appellee Micah Vasconcellos's (Vasconcellos) Motion to Suppress Statements. 
On appeal, the State contends that the district court 
erred in granting the Judgment and in concluding that there was a 
custodial interrogation at the point police stopped 
Vasconcellos's vehicle or when they observed Vasconcellos's 
bloodshot eyes, slurred speech, and the odor of alcohol, and that 
1 The Honorable Summer Kupau-Odo presided.       
   
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
police were required to provide Vasconcellos with Miranda 
warnings at those points. The State more particularly argues 
that: (1) probable cause to arrest Vasconcellos for Reckless 
Driving, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291-2 
(2007),  did not exist at the time he was stopped; (2) probable 
cause to arrest Vasconcellos for Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of HRS § 291E-
61(a)(1) (Supp. 2018),  did not exist at the time the police 
officer initially observed Vasconcellos's bloodshot eyes, slurred speech, and the odor of alcohol; and therefore (3) Miranda 
warnings were not required at those points because Vasconcellos 
was not in custody or subjected to interrogation. Thus, the 432
2 Miranda v. Arizona , 384 U.S. 436 (1966). 
A critical safeguard [of the privilege against
self-incrimination] is the Miranda  warning: an accused
must be "warned that he or she had a right to remain
silent, that anything said could be used against himor her, that he or she had a right to the presence ofan attorney, and that if he or she could not afford anattorney one would be appointed for him or her." 
State v. Kazanas, 138 Hawai #i 23, 34, 375 P.3d 1261, 1272 (2016) (quoting
State v. Ketchum, 97 Hawai #i 107, 116, 34 P.3d 1006, 1015 (2001)). 
3 HRS § 291-2 provides: 
§291-2 Reckless driving of vehicle or riding of
animals; penalty. Whoever operates any vehicle or rides any
animal recklessly in disregard of the safety of persons orproperty is guilty of reckless driving of vehicle orreckless riding of an animal, as appropriate, and shall befined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more thanthirty days, or both. 
4 HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) provides: 
§291E-61 Operating a vehicle under the influence of an
intoxicant. (a) A person commits the offense of operating a
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if the personoperates or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle: 
(1) While under the influence of alcohol in an amount sufficient to impair the person's normalmental faculties or ability to care for theperson and guard against casualty[.] 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
State argues that Vasconcellos's responses to being informed of 
why he was stopped, to the medical rule-out questions, and to 
whether he was willing to participate in field sobriety tests, as
well as Vasconcellos's actual performance on the field sobriety 
tests, should not have been suppressed.  
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we affirm in part,
vacate in part, and remand for the reasons set forth below.  
 
The proponent of the motion to suppress has the burden of
establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that thestatements or items sought to be excluded were unlawfullysecured and that his or her right to be free fromunreasonable searches or seizures was violated under the fourth amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 7 of the Hawai #i Constitution. 
State v. Estabillio, 121 Hawai# i 261, 269, 218 P.3d 749, 757 
(2009) (citations omitted). A ruling on a motion to suppress is 
reviewed 
de novo, and the appellate court must look at the entire
record on appeal to determine whether the ruling was right or 
wrong. State v. Joseph, 109 Hawai# i 482, 493, 128 P.3d 795, 806 
(2006).  
Where an individual is being subjected to custodial
interrogation, he [or she] may not be asked any questionswithout his [or her] first being advised of his [or her]right to remain silent, that anything he [or she] says canand will be used against him [or her], that he [or she] hasthe right to have his [or her] attorney present, and that ifhe [or she] cannot afford counsel, one will be appointed forhim [or her] prior to any interrogation. Miranda v. 
Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 467-474, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d694 (1966); State v. Santiago, 53 Haw. 254, 492 P.2d 657(1971). "Custodial interrogation" means "questioninginitiated by law enforcement officers after a person hasbeen taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his [orher] freedom of action in any significant way." 384 U.S. at 444. 
State v. Kalai, 56 Haw. 366, 368, 537 P.2d 8, 11 (1975) (emphasis 
omitted). 
Custodial interrogation consists of two components: 
"interrogation" and "custody." Kazanas, 138 
Hawai# i at 35, 375
P.3d at 1273.  
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In determining whether the defendant's statement was made in
a custodial context, the totality of circumstances must beconsidered, including the time, place and length of theinterrogation, the nature of the questions asked, theconduct of the police at the time of the interrogation, andany other pertinent factors. 
Id. (emphasis omitted) (quoting State v. Paahana, 66 Haw. 499, 
502-03, 666 P.2d 592, 595-96 (1983)); see State v. Melemai, 64 
Haw. 479, 481, 643 P.2d 541, 544 (1982) (stating that whether a 
defendant was in custody or otherwise deprived of his or her 
freedom of action in any significant way is determined by 
objectively appraising the totality of the circumstances). "In 
this regard, we have acknowledged that 'no precise line can be 
drawn' between 'custodial interrogation,' on the one hand, and 
'permissible general on-the-scene questioning,' on the other." 
State v. Ah Loo, 94 Hawai# i 207, 210, 10 P.3d 728, 731 (2000) 
(brackets omitted) (quoting State v. Patterson, 59 Haw. 357, 362, 581 P.2d 752, 755-56 (1978)). 
In contrast, "determining whether 'interrogation' has 
taken place is not measured by the 'totality of the 
circumstances,'" Kazanas, 138 Hawai# i at 35, 375 P.3d at 1273, 
but rather, "the touchstone . . . is whether the police officer 'should have known that his or her words and actions were 
reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the 
defendant.'" Id. at 38, 375 P.3d at 1276 (brackets omitted) 
(quoting Paahana, 66 Haw. at 503, 666 P.2d at 595-96). 
In Ah Loo, the supreme court stated: 
[W]e reaffirm the principle that, when an officer lawfully
"seizes" a person in order to conduct an investigative stop,the officer is not required to inform that person of his orher Miranda rights before posing questions that arereasonably designed to confirm or dispel--as briefly aspossible and without any coercive connotation by either wordor conduct--the officer's reasonable suspicion that criminalactivity is afoot. 
94 Hawai# i at 212, 10 P.3d at 733. This is because, as a per se 
matter, a defendant is not "in custody" for purposes of Miranda 
merely because he or she has been "seized" or pulled over 
pursuant to a valid traffic stop. State v. Kaleohano, 99 Hawai# i 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
370, 376, 56 P.3d 138, 144 (2002) (citing Ah Loo, 94 Hawai# i at 
212, 10 P.3d at 733). "[I]f neither probable cause to arrest nor 
sustained and coercive interrogation are present, then questions 
posed by the police do not rise to the level of 'custodial 
interrogation' requiring 
Miranda warnings." Id.
 at 377, 56 P.3d 
at 145 (quoting Ah Loo, 94 Hawai# i at 210, 10 P.3d at 731). 
Further, when a defendant's statements are not the product of a 
custodial interrogation, it need not be shown that the defendant 
was advised of his or her Miranda rights and waived those rights, 
in order for the statements to be admitted into evidence. State 
v. Pahio, 58 Haw. 323, 327, 568 P.2d 1200, 1204 (1977), abrogated on other grounds by State v. Cabagbag, 127 Hawai# i 302, 277 P.3d 
1027 (2012). 
HRS § 291-2 provides: 
Whoever operates any vehicle or rides any animal recklessly
in disregard of the safety of persons or property is guiltyof reckless driving of vehicle or reckless riding of ananimal, as appropriate, and shall be fined not more than$1,000 or imprisoned not more than thirty days, or both. 
The supreme court in State v. Agard, 113 Hawai# i 321, 322, 151
P.3d 802, 803 (2007) stated:  
We hold that (1) the reckless state of mind definition underHRS § 702–206(3) (1993) applies to the reckless drivingstatute, HRS § 291–2; (2) in determining whether anidentified risk is substantial and unjustifiable under HRS §702–206(3), the nature and degree of the risk disregarded bythe actor, the nature and purpose of his conduct, and thecircumstances known to him in acting must be weighed; (3) inthis case a reckless state of mind can be inferred from the circumstances to conclude that there was conscious awareness of a substantial and unjustifiable risk to the safety ofothers and property on the part of Respondent; and (4)deference must be given to the trier of fact with respect toquestions of credibility and weight of the evidence. 
In other words, it must be shown that the "Defendant knew whether 
'the safety of persons or property' was in peril." State v. 
Quinn, No. 30111, 2010 WL 2675349, at *1 (Haw. App. July 7, 2010) (SDO) (quoting State v. Moleta, 112 Hawai# i 233, 240, 145 P.3d 
776, 783 (App. 2006)). 
At the hearing on Vasconcellos’s Motion to Suppress 
Statements, Officer Borges testified that he had observed 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Vasconcellos make an improper left turn from a straight ahead 
only lane and nearly strike a pedestrian in a marked crosswalk 
with the cross signal, without stopping, swerving, or slowing. 
Officer Borges then stated that upon stopping Vasconcellos’s 
vehicle, he approached the vehicle and engaged Vasconcellos, 
explaining his observations to Vasconcellos. When Officer Borges 
informed him of why he was stopped, Vasconcellos initially stated 
that he saw the pedestrian and stopped. Thereafter, Officer 
Borges related to Vasconcellos that he did not observe him stop 
and Vasconcellos then stated that he swerved or drove around and 
let the pedestrian cross. We conclude that at this initial point 
of the stop, a person of reasonable caution would have been 
warranted in believing that Vasconcellos had a conscious 
awareness that his driving had posed a substantial and 
unjustifiable risk to the safety of others and property, to wit, 
the pedestrian. See HRS § 291-2; Agard, 113 Hawai# i at 322, 151 
P.3d at 803; State v. Maganis, 109 Hawai# i 84, 86, 123 P.3d 679, 
681 (2005) ("Probable cause exists when the facts and 
circumstances within one's knowledge and of which one has 
reasonably trustworthy information are sufficient in themselves 
to warrant a person of reasonable caution to believe that an 
offense has been committed. 
This requires more than a mere 
suspicion but less than a certainty." (Emphasis and citation omitted)). Accordingly, the district court did not err in 
concluding that Officer Borges had probable cause to arrest 
Vasconcellos for Reckless Driving at the point of stopping his 
vehicle. 
Based on the totality of the circumstances, where 
Officer Borges had probable cause to arrest Vasconcellos for 
Reckless Driving and had testified that Vasconcellos was not free 
to leave at this point, we conclude that Vasconcellos was in 
custody for Reckless Driving. See Kazanas, 138 Hawai# i at 35, 
375 P.3d at 1273; Kaleohano, 99 Hawai# i at 377, 56 P.3d at 145. 
Thus, Miranda
 warnings were warranted prior to any subsequent 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
interrogation. The district court did not err in determining 
that Vasconcellos was in custody upon Officer Borges stopping his 
vehicle. 
Notwithstanding the above, Officer Borges was not 
required to provide Vasconcellos with Miranda warnings prior to 
informing Vasconcellos of why he was stopped. As we recently 
held in State v. Sagapolutele-Silva, "[g]enerally, informing a 
defendant of the reason for being stopped or arrested does not 
constitute custodial interrogation likely to elicit an 
incriminating response." No. CAAP-19-0000491, 2020 WL 1699907, 
at *9 (Haw. App. Apr. 8, 2020) (citations omitted); see Rhode 
Island v. Innis, 446 U.S. 291, 301 (1980) (holding that the term 
"interrogation" does not include "words or actions on the part of 
the police [that are] normally attendant to arrest and custody"); 
United States v. Moreno-Flores, 33 F.3d 1164, 1169 (9th Cir. 
1994) ("[W]hen an officer informs a [suspect] of [the] 
circumstances" of his arrest or explains evidence against him, 
"this information may be considered normally attendant to arrest 
and custody." (quoting United States v. Crisco, 725 F.2d 1228, 
1232 (9th Cir. 1984))). Officer Borges informing Vasconcellos of 
why he was stopped did not amount to an "interrogation" and 
Miranda warnings were not required. The district court erred in 
holding that there was an interrogation at this point and 
suppressing the aforementioned statements Vasconcellos made in 
response to being informed of the reason that he was stopped. 
During the exchange with Vasconcellos, Officer Borges 
observed that Vasconcellos had bloodshot eyes, was speaking with 
slurred speech, and had an odor of alcohol about him. Thus, 
Officer Borges's attention turned to whether Vasconcellos 
committed the offense of OVUII. The investigation for OVUII 
constituted a separate, distinct, and unrelated investigation 
from the initial traffic stop, requiring an independent 
reasonable suspicion to be a valid detainment. See Estabillio, 
121 Hawai# i at 272-73, 218 P.3d at 760-61 (stating that an 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
investigation for drug involvement constituted a separate, 
distinct, and unrelated investigation from the initial stop for 
traffic offenses, thus requiring an independent reasonable 
suspicion to be a constitutional seizure). 
There was reasonable suspicion to believe that 
Vasconcellos committed the offense of OVUII based upon Officer 
Borges's observations of Vasconcellos's driving, his red and 
bloodshot eyes, and the smell of alcohol about him. See State v. 
Barrickman, 95 Hawai# i 270, 274-77, 21 P.3d 475, 479-82 (App. 
2001) (concluding that there was reasonable suspicion to believe 
that the defendant was driving while intoxicated at the time the 
investigative stop commenced because the defendant failed to 
follow the instructions of the officer directing traffic and was 
observed to have glassy eyes and alcohol on his breath). 
Nonetheless, red and glassy eyes alone, and imperfect driving, 
are insufficient to establish probable cause to arrest a person 
for OVUII. See Kaleohano, 99 Hawai# i at 377, 56 P.3d at 145 
("Although these factors may give rise to a reasonable suspicion that [a person] was driving while impaired, they do not amount to 
probable cause for an arrest."). 
In Kernan
, the court noted: 
Usually, the police administer a field sobriety test
consisting of specific procedures when a driver has beenstopped as a DUI suspect. If a driver does not exit voluntarily, the police must order him or her out of thevehicle even though probable cause to arrest may not havebeen established. Should the suspect fail the test, anarrest will ensue. Thus, it is the test failure thatprovides the police with probable cause to arrest. We do not require the police to have probable cause to arrestprior to the administration of the field sobriety testbecause such a requirement unduly burdens law enforcement. 
75 Haw. at 38 n.23, 856 P.2d at 1226 n.23. Thus, prior to asking 
whether Vasconcellos wished to take the field sobriety test, 
Vasconcellos's red and bloodshot eyes, slurred speech, and the 
odor of alcohol about him did not provide Officer Borges with 
probable cause for an OVUII arrest. The district court therefore 
erred in determining that there was probable cause to arrest 
Vasconcellos for OVUII at this point. However, as we previously 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
stated, Vasconcellos was in custody for Reckless Driving and the 
district court did not err in determining that he was in custody 
and that Miranda warnings were warranted prior to any 
interrogation. 
After observing Vasconcellos’s red and bloodshot eyes, 
slurred speech, and odor of alcohol about him, Officer Borges 
asked Vasconcellos to step out of his vehicle. Vasconcellos then 
exited the vehicle and Officer Borges asked him whether he would 
be willing to participate in a field sobriety test. Vasconcellos 
responded to the effect of "please don't do this. You're ruining 
my life" and then later agreed to participate. The district 
court held that asking Vasconcellos if he would be willing to 
participate in a field sobriety test constituted custodial 
interrogation and suppressed Vasconcellos’s responses. This was 
in error. In Pennsylvania v. Muniz, the Supreme Court determined 
that a police officer's questioning of a defendant regarding 
whether the defendant understood the field sobriety test 
instructions and wished to submit to the test did not amount to 
an "interrogation" because they were "limited and focused 
inquiries [that] were necessarily 'attendant to' the legitimate 
police procedure and were not likely to be perceived as calling 
for any incriminating response." 496 U.S. 582, 605 (1990) 
(citation omitted); see Innis, 446 U.S. at 301 (holding that the 
term "interrogation" does not include "words or actions on the 
part of the police [that are] normally attendant to arrest and 
custody"). Vasconcellos's responses to whether he would 
participate in the test were attendant to legitimate police 
procedures, and should not have been suppressed. 
Upon Vasconcellos's agreement to participate in the 
field sobriety tests, Officer Borges asked him what are known as 
medical rule-out questions. Officer Borges testified that the 
medical rule-out questions consisted of inquiring whether 
Vasconcellos "had any physical defects or speech impediments, if 
he's currently under the care of a doctor, an eye doctor, or a 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
dentist, if he was diabetic or epileptic, if he was blind in 
either eye, wearing any contacts, or taking any medications." 
Vasconcellos replied in the negative to all of the medical rule-
out questions. The district court suppressed Vasconcellos's 
responses to the medical rule-out questions, finding that 
Vasconcellos was in custody and that the questions would elicit 
incriminating responses. We agree with the district court. The 
medical rule-out questions amounted to an interrogation because 
they 
required a testimonial response that disclosed facts
relating to the offense of OVUII and that was reasonablylikely to assist the police in determining whether [thesuspect] was under the influence of an intoxicant by eitheradmitting or denying there were other causes that couldexplain her actions. A negative response to all of thequestions is testimonial, and combined with physicalcharacteristics of impairment, supports an incriminatinginference of impairment. Similarly, a positive response towhether a defendant is taking any medicines, in someinstances, may constitute an incriminating statement. 
Sagapolutele-Silva, No. CAAP-19-0000491, 2020 WL 1699907, at *8; 
see also Mathis v. United States, 391 U.S. 1, 2, 4-5 (1968). 
Although Vasconcellos was not in custody for OVUII when the 
medical rule-out questions were posed, he was in custody for 
Reckless Driving. As we determined in Sagapolutele-Silva, "the 
failure to provide a Miranda warning when required for one crime 
will taint a subsequent interrogation even if the interrogation 
relates to a different crime for which Miranda warnings were not 
yet required, if a defendant is still in custody." Id. at *7 
(citing People v. Bejasa, 205 Cal. App. 4th 26, 140 Cal. Rptr. 3d 80, 91 (2012)). Accordingly, Vasconcellos was subjected to a 
custodial interrogation without having first been given Miranda 
warnings. Thus, the district court did not err in suppressing 
Vasconcellos’s responses to the medical rule-out questions. 
We next turn to the suppression of the results of the 
field sobriety test. "Field sobriety tests are designed and 
administered to avoid the shortcomings of casual observation." 
State v. Wyatt, 67 Haw. 293, 302, 687 P.2d 544, 551 (1984) 
10 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(brackets and citations omitted). Although field sobriety tests 
may have a purpose of gathering evidence of a driver's criminal 
conduct, "the privilege against self-incrimination is not 
necessarily implicated whenever a person suspected of criminal 
activity is compelled in some way to cooperate in developing 
evidence which may be used against him [or her]." Id. In Wyatt, 
the supreme court held that a suspect's performance on field sobriety tests was an exhibition of physical characteristics of 
coordination. Id. at 303, 687 P.2d at 551. The Wyatt court 
further held that a suspect's performance on field sobriety tests were neither communication nor testimony and therefore did not 
implicate the suspect's right against self-incrimination. Id. at 
301-03, 687 P.2d at 550-51. Applied here, the district court therefore erred in suppressing Officer Borges's observations of 
Vasconcellos's physical performance on the field sobriety test. 
As an alternative basis for the district court's 
Judgment, Vasconcellos argues, based on State v. Tsujimura, 140 
Hawai# i 299, 400 P.3d 500 (2017), that the right to remain silent 
is triggered upon detainment as a result of an investigatory stop, Miranda warnings are required at that time, and thus any 
statements obtained thereafter without Miranda warnings and a 
waiver of Miranda rights are subject to suppression. 
Vasconcellos’s reliance upon Tsujimura is misplaced. In 
Tsujimura, the court noted that it is a "well established tenet 
that a person being questioned by a law enforcement officer 
during an investigatory stop 'is not obliged to respond.'" 
Tsujimura, 140 Hawai# i at 313, 400 P.3d at 514 (quoting Berkemer 
v. McCarty, 468 U.S. 420, 439, 104 S. Ct. 3138, 82 L. Ed.2d 317 (1984)). However, Tsujimura does not require a law enforcement 
officer to advise a person of their right to remain silent 
because they were detained as a result of an investigatory stop. 
Rather, it prohibits pre-arrest silence from being used as 
substantial proof of guilt at trial. Tsujimura, 140 Hawai# i at 
311-13, 400 P.3d at 512-14. 
11 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Based on the foregoing, the district court erred in 
suppressing: (1) Vasconcellos's statements in response to Officer 
Borges informing him of the reasons for the investigatory stop; 
(2) Vasconcellos's responses to being asked whether he would 
participate in the field sobriety test; and (3) the results of 
the field sobriety test. The district court did not err in 
suppressing Vasconcellos's responses to the medical rule-out 
questions.
