(1) On July 1, 2019, self-represented Petitioner-
Appellant William Jackson Gay Barnes (Barnes) filed the notice of
appeal;
(2) On August 26, 2019, the circuit court clerk filed
the record on appeal, and the appellate clerk notified the
parties that the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief were
due on or before September 5, 2019, and October 7, 2019,
respectively;
(3) Barnes did not file either document or request an
extension of time;
(4) On October 23, 2019, the appellate clerk notified
Barnes that the time for filing the statement of jurisdiction and
opening brief had expired, the matter would be called to theNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
court's attention on November 4, 2019, for appropriate action,
which could include dismissal of the appeal, under Hawai#i Rules
of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rules 12.1(e) and 30, and Barnes
may request relief from default by motion; and
(5) The appellate clerk mailed the notice of entering
case on calendar and the default notice to Barnes at his address
on record.  The United States Postal Service returned the
envelopes marked, "Unable to Forward," and the Oahu Community
Correctional Center marked the envelopes, "Return to Sender,
Inmate Discharged."  Mellow has not filed a notice of change of
address, consistent with HRAP Rule 25(f), and he took no further
action in this appeal.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is
dismissed.
