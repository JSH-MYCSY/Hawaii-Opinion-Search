APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CRIMINAL NUMBER 2PC990000325) 
MARCH 8, 2021 
LEONARD, PRESIDING JUDGE, HIRAOKA AND WADSWORTH, JJ. 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY HIRAOKA, J. 
In 2001, a jury convicted Defendant-Appellant Scott 
Brian Smith (Smith
) of assault, terroristic threatening, sexual 
assault, and kidnapping. The Circuit Court of the Second Circuit 
sentenced him to concurrent and consecutive prison terms totaling 45 years (Original Sentence).
1 He appealed. We affirmed. State 
v. Smith, 106 Hawai# i 365, 105 P.3d 242 (App. 2004) (Smith I). 
1 The Honorable Shackley F. Raffetto presided over Smith's trial and
original sentencing. FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
This appeal arises from two post-conviction motions 
filed by Smith in his criminal case, Hawai# i Judiciary Informa-
tion Management System (JIMS) case 2PC990000325 (the Criminal 
Case). On December 27, 2017, Smith filed a motion seeking review 
of his consecutive sentences under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 
§ 706-668.5(3) (Motion to Review Consecutive Sentence).2 On 
November 21, 2018, the circuit court3 entered "Findings of Fact 
and Conclusions of Law on Defendant's Motion to Review 
Consecutive Sentence Under HRS §[ ]706-668.5" (Order Denying
Motion to Review Consecutive Sentence). The circuit court denied 
Smith's motion but found the sentence imposed for the kidnapping 
conviction to have been illegal. The circuit court directed Smith to file a petition for relief under Rule 40 of the Hawai# i 
Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP). 
As directed, on January 2, 2019, Smith filed an HRPP 
Rule 40 petition. A new JIMS case, 2PR191000001, was opened as a result of that filing. The circuit court granted the petition and ordered that Smith be resentenced at a further hearing in the Criminal Case. 
2 At that time HRS § 706-668.5 (Supp. 2016) provided, in relevant 
part: 
§ 706-668.5 Multiple sentence of imprisonment. . . . 
. . . . (3) 
For terms of imprisonment imposed prior to
June 18, 2008, the department of public safety shall post
written notice in all inmate housing units and the facilitylibrary at each correctional facility for a period of twomonths and send written notice to the defendant no later than January 1, 2016, that shall include but not be limitedto: 
(a) Notice that the department of public safety may
recalculate the multiple terms of imprisonmentimposed on the defendant; and 
(b) Notice of the defendant's right to have the
court review the defendant's sentence. 
3 The Honorable Peter T. Cahill presided over all subsequent
proceedings at issue in this appeal. 
2 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
  
 On May 2, 2019, in the Criminal Case, the circuit court 
entered the "Judgment; Conviction and Sentence; Notice of Entry" 
(
2019 Sentence).  The 2019 Sentence increased the sentence for 
kidnapping (Count 8) from 10 to 20 years, but ran the kidnapping sentence concurrently with the 20-year sentences for Smith's other class A felony offenses (Counts 3-6). The sentence for the remaining B felony (Count 1) remained consecutive to the concurrent sentences for the A felonies. The 5-year sentences on the class C felonies ran concurrently with each other and concurrently with the consecutive sentences on Counts 1, 3-6, and 8. That resulted in Smith's total sentence being reduced from 45 
to 30 years. 
On July 1, 2019, in the Criminal Case, Smith filed a 
new motion to reduce his sentence based on his medical condition (Motion to Reduce Sentence). The State opposed the motion. 
Smith filed reply and supplemental memoranda. The circuit court 
entered the "Order Denying Defendant's Rule 35(b) Motion" on September 20, 2019 (Order Denying Motion to Reduce Sentence). 
In this appeal Smith contends that the circuit court 
erred when it: (1) reviewed but failed to alter his consecutive 
sentences; (2) recalculated his illegal sentence; (3) failed to 
resentence him to concurrent terms; and (4) denied his motion to 
reduce his sentence for medical reasons. For the reasons 
explained below, we affirm the Order Denying Motion to Review Consecutive Sentence, vacate the 2019 Sentence, affirm the Order Denying Motion to Reduce Sentence, and remand for resentencing consistent with this opinion. 
BACKGROUND 
On June 26, 1999, from sometime after midnight until 
after sunrise, Smith threatened, assaulted, kidnapped, and repeatedly raped the complaining witness (CW), Smith's former 
girlfriend, in the presence of their 2½-year-old child. CW was 
taken to a hospital emergency room, where a doctor found that her 
3 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
right eye socket and left ring finger were fractured, her eyes 
were severely bruised and nearly swollen shut, and she had contusions on both ears. She also had lacerations on her right thigh, right arm, chin, and left thumb, all of which appeared to have been made with a sharp instrument. CW remained hospitalized for four days.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
The Criminal Case 
Smith was charged by complaint with attempted murder 
(Count 1), terroristic threatening (Count 2), sexual assault 
(Counts 3-7), kidnapping (Count 8), use of deadly or dangerous weapon (Count 9), and unauthorized control of propelled vehicle (Count 10).
5 During trial the State introduced evidence 
recovered from CW's residence, including a utility knife found beneath the child's bed; a woman's pantie that was shredded and soaked with blood; and a comforter, a cloth towel, and paper towels, all stained with blood. CW testified that she used paper towels to wipe herself after Smith's sexual assaults. Photo-graphs showing blood and slash marks on the walls of the child's bedroom and blood on a living room couch and the hallway walls were also admitted into evidence. 
The jury found Smith guilty of the following offenses:

Direct Appeal 
Smith appealed. He contended, among other things, that 
the trial court abused its discretion by sentencing him to 
extended terms of imprisonment. Smith I, 106 Hawai# i at 378, 105 
P.3d at 255. We noted that Smith was sentenced to consecutive, not extended, terms of imprisonment pursuant to HRS § 706-668.5,
11 after the trial court considered the sentencing factors 
set forth in HRS § 706-606.12 We rejected Smith's other 
11 HRS § 706-668.5 (1993) provided: 
§ 706-668.5 Multiple sentence of imprisonment.
(1) If multiple terms of imprisonment are imposed on a
defendant at the same time, or if a term of imprisonment isimposed on a defendant who is already subject to anunexpired term of imprisonment, the terms may runconcurrently or consecutively. Multiple terms ofimprisonment imposed at the same time run concurrentlyunless the court orders or the statute mandates that the terms run consecutively. . . . 
(2) The court, in determining whether the terms
imposed are to be ordered to run concurrently orconsecutively, shall consider the factors set forth insection 706-606. 
12 HRS § 706-606 (1993) provided: 
HRS § 706-606 Factors to be considered in imposing a

(1) The nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of thedefendant; 
(2) The need for the sentence imposed: 
(a) To reflect the seriousness of the offense,
to promote respect for law, and to providejust punishment for the offense; 
(b) To afford adequate deterrence to criminalconduct; 
(c) To protect the public from further crimesof the defendant; and 
(d) To provide the defendant with needededucational or vocational training,medical care, or other correctionaltreatment in the most effective manner;

application for writ of certiorari was denied. State v. Smith, 
106 Hawai# i 477, 106 P.3d 1120 (Table) (2005). 
First Rule 40 Petition 
On July 29, 2013, Smith filed a petition  under HRPP 
Rule 40.13
 Smith contended: (1) he was denied the right to an 
impartial judge; (2) he received ineffective assistance of 
counsel at trial, during sentencing, and in his direct appeal; (3) he was deprived of discovery and access to evidence; (4) the jury was tampered with; and (5) the trial court erroneously instructed the jury about reasonable doubt. The circuit court denied the petition. Smith appealed. We affirmed, concluding that all of Smith's claims were either previously raised and ruled upon or were without merit. Smith v.

At any time but not prior to final

procedure set forth in this rule from the judgment ofconviction, on the following grounds: (i) that thejudgment was obtained or sentence imposed in violationof the constitution of the United States or of the State of 
Hawai #i; (ii) that the court which rendered
the judgment was without jurisdiction over the personor the subject matter; (iii) that the sentence isillegal; (iv) that there is newly discovered evidence;or (v) any ground which is a basis for collateralattack on the judgment.

denied. Smith v. State, No. SCWC-13-0005313, 2015 WL 6966318 
(Haw. Nov. 10, 2015). 
Motion to Recalculate Sentence 
On October 27, 2015 (while the application for writ of 
certiorari in Smith II was pending), Smith filed a motion to 
recalculate his multiple terms of imprisonment under Act 194 of the 2015 legislative session.
15 The motion was filed in the 
special prisoner proceeding created when Smith filed the First Rule 40 Petition, addressed in Smith II. The circuit court noted that the judgment on appeal in Smith II had been entered, but stated it was "unable to ascertain whether it has jurisdiction" because it did not know whether Smith had petitioned for certiorari. The circuit court denied the motion "without prejudice to the issue being raised in the proper proceeding." Smith appealed. We affirmed, holding: 
Smith filed his [motion to recalculate sentence] at a time
when [Smith II] was on appeal. Therefore, the Circuit Courtwas correct that Smith's, [sic] filing of the Motion toRecalculate Sentence . . . was not "proper." . . . In anyevent, the Circuit Court denied the Motion to RecalculateSentence without prejudice to Smith raising his Act 194claim in another proceeding. Because Smith is free to filean HRPP Rule 40 petition raising a claim under Act 194, andgiven the muddled record relating to his Act 194 claim, weconclude that the Circuit Court did not err in denyingwithout prejudice Smith's Motion to Recalculate Sentence.

Second Rule 40 Petition 
On May 31, 2017, Smith filed a second petition for 
post-conviction relief.16 Smith contended that: (1) the circuit 
court's imposition of consecutive sentences violated his right to 
a fair trial, and the court failed to consider all statutory sentencing factors or state its reason for imposing multiple consecutive sentences; (2) the court improperly "based the severity of sentencing on [Smith's] failure to take responsi-bility and admit guilt"; (3) the court failed to instruct the jury on the possibility of merger of Count 1 (assault) and Count 8 (kidnapping); and (4) appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to previously raise issues regarding the omission of a merger instruction and the circuit court's "penalizing [Smith] for the court's lack of remorse perception[.]" Smith v. State, 
No. CAAP-18-0000079, 2020 WL 2790498, at *2 (Haw. App. May 29, 2020) (mem.) (Smith IV) (brackets in original). On December 12, 
2017, the circuit court denied the petition without a hearing. 
Smith's motion for reconsideration was also denied. Smith appealed. 
In that appeal we took judicial notice of the separate 
proceeding pending on Smith's December 27, 2017 Motion to Review Consecutive Sentence (at issue in this appeal). Smith IV, 2020 
WL 2790498, at *5. We held that Smith's argument that his sentence was illegal was moot because of the pendency of the Motion to Review Consecutive Sentence. Id. However, we held 
that the circuit court's failure to instruct the jury about the possible merger of Counts 1 (assault) and 8 (kidnapping) was plain error. We remanded the case for the State to either "remedy the merger-instruction error by dismissing one of the two counts that could potentially merge or, if the State chooses, the State may retry Smith on both counts." Id. at *10. The judgment 
on appeal was entered on July 2, 2020. Smith did not petition

for certiorari. We take judicial notice that the State has not 
yet initiated proceedings on remand. See Rule 201, Hawai# i Rules 
of Evidence, Chapter 626, Hawaii Revised Statutes (2016). JIMS case 2PC990000325. 
Motion to Review 
Consecutive Sentence 
On December 27, 2017, Smith filed the Motion to Review 
Consecutive Sentence. He contended that: (1) he had a right to 
have his sentence reviewed under HRS § 706-668.5(3);  and 
(2) his consecutive sentences were illegal because the sentencing court did not adequately explain its rationale for imposing consecutive sentences, as required by State v. Barrios, 139 Hawai
#i 321, 389 P.3d 916 (2016). The Motion to Review 
Consecutive Sentence cited neither HRPP Rule 35  nor HRPP 
Rule 40. 1817
On November 21, 2018, the circuit court entered the 
Order Denying Motion to Review Consecutive Sentence. Circuit court judge Peter T. Cahill found, among other things: 
11. The Court finds that two separate issues arise,
the first involving a request to review the consecutive
sentencing under the statute [HRS § 706-668.5(3)], andsecondly, a separate issue of HRPP Rule 40 illegality of thesentence. 
17 See note 2. 
18 HRPP Rule 35 provides, in relevant part: 
(a) Correction of Illegal Sentence.  The court may
correct an illegal sentence at any time and may correct asentence imposed in an illegal manner within the timeprovided herein for the reduction of sentence. A motion made by a defendant to correct an illegal sentence more than90 days after the sentence is imposed shall be made pursuantto Rule 40 of these rules. . . . 
(b) Reduction of Sentence.  The court may reduce a
sentence within 90 days after the sentence is imposed[.]. . . A motion to reduce a sentence that is made within the time prior shall empower the court to act on such motioneven though the time period has expired. The filing of anotice of appeal shall not deprive the court of jurisdictionto entertain a timely motion to reduce a sentence. 
11 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
12. The Court finds that under [an HRS § 706-668.5]
motion to review, the trial court only need go back and look
at the judgment and review whether the sentencing judgespecified consecutive sentences. The court finds that the 
sentencing judge intended to impose consecutive sentencing . 
13. The Court finds in a motion to review, the legal
reasoning of State v. Barrios, 139 [Hawai #i] 321, 389 P.3d
916 (2016), may not be applied retroactively to evaluate thesentencing court's considerations.[
19] 
14. However, the court finds that there are clear
errors in the original sentence imposed and the sentence isillegal because it was based on something contrary to thejury's decision. 
. . . . 
18. The court may correct an illegal sentence at any
time. Under HRPP Rule 35 a defendant must file a motion to 
correct an illegal sentence within 90 days of the sentencebeing imposed. 
19. A motion made by a defendant to correct an
illegal sentence more than 90 days after the sentence isimposed shall be made pursuant to HRPP Rule 40. 
20. A defendant is entitled to have all of the 
issues raised in this proceeding reviewed under HRPPRule 40. 
21. As defendant's court-appointed counsel,
[counsel] is directed to refile his motion as an HRPP rule[sic] 40 proceeding. 
(emphasis added) (underscoring in original). Judge Cahill 
concluded: 
1. The Court holds that a review under HRS § 706-
668.5 involves the court simply looking at whether the
defendant's judgment specified that the sentences were torun consecutive [sic]. 
Judge Cahill held that the consecutive sentences originally 
imposed by Judge Raffetto were legal because Judge Raffetto "intended to impose consecutive sentencing." 
However, Judge Cahill found that the Original Sentence 
was illegal in part, because Smith's kidnapping conviction should

conclusion of law and consistent with State v. Hussein

after the filing date of the judgment
herein, circuit courts must state on the record at the time of sentencing the
reasons for imposing a consecutive sentence.") (underscoring added).

have been sentenced as a class A felony, not as a class B felony, 
based on the jury's answers to interrogatories. Attached to Smith's Motion to Review Consecutive Sentence was a copy of the transcript of proceedings on November 20, 2002, Smith's original sentencing hearing. The transcript stated: 
THE COURT: Thank you, counsel. Very well, then, the
Court is doing [sic] to go ahead and impose sentence as
follows. 
[Deputy Prosecuting Attorney]: Could I say one thing?
The pre-sentence report -- Page 13 of the pre-sentencereport reflects the kidnapping charge is a Class B felony,but that is not accurate. The jury found facts for Class A,so this is a Class A felony kidnapping. 
. . . . 
THE COURT: I am not sure of that. Okay. I was the 
trial judge in the case, so I am very familiar with the
facts that were produced at trial and based upon that[.] 
Judge Raffetto erroneously sentenced the kidnapping count as a 
class B, not a class A, felony. Judge Cahill directed Smith to refile the Motion to Review Consecutive Sentence as an HRPP Rule 40 petition. 
Third Rule 40 Petition 
On January 2, 2019, as directed by the circuit court, 
Smith filed another HRPP Rule 40 petition.
20 Smith contended 
that the Original Sentence was illegal, and asked to be 
resentenced. 
On March 20, 2019, the circuit court entered findings 
of fact, conclusions of law, and an order granting the petition. Smith did not appeal from that order. The circuit court found, among other things: 
8. After jury trial, Smith was sentenced upon
convictions for: four counts of sexual assault in the first 
degree ("A" felony, 20 year term); Assault 1 andKidnap[p]ing (each as [sic] "B" felony, 10 year term); and 
20 A new JIMS case, 2PR191000001, was opened as a result of the
filing. 
13 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Terroristic Threatening 1 and Use of a Deadly Weapon (each
[a] "C" felony, five year term). There was an issue as to whether the Kidnapping conviction was an "A" or "B" gradeconviction. 
9. The trial court imposed multiple consecutive
sentences. [Smith] would serve all of the "A" felonycharges for sexual assault concurrently for a 20 yearsentence. The "B" felony charges of 10 years would beserved consecutively for 20 years. The trial court ruled that only the "A" felony charges were concurrent, and allother charge levels with respect to each other, wereconsecutive. 
10. On the judgment, it provides the "C" felony
charges would be served concurrent for 5 years. The kidnapping would be a "B" felony, and the two "B" felonieswould be consecutive to each other. Also, each of thedifferent grade level terms would be consecutive to eachother such that [Smith} was given a 45 year sentence(20+10+10+5). 
11. The Kidnapping conviction should have been an "A"
felony because the jury answered interrogatories for thekidnapping verdict answering yes to each question that[Smith] did not release CW voluntarily; without serious orsubstantial bodily injury; or in a safe place. 
12. The court finds that there is an inconsistency
between the jury's findings and the trial verdict; thesentencing transcript and the judgment as to the grade ofthe Kidnapping conviction; and application of consecutivesentencing with regards to the "C" felonies and otherlevels, depending upon whether the Kidnapping conviction wasan "A" felony, and/or there was only one "B" felonyconviction and only 10 years consecutive (since there wouldbe only one grade level charge). 
. . . . 
15. The court finds that the "B" kidnapping was
erroneous, and then when it was run consecutive to the other"B" felony, such was a clear illegal sentence because[Smith] was not found guilty of "B" felony kidnapping andthe sentence was based upon something other than the jury'sfinding. 
16. The Court finds that another inconsistency is if
Kidnapping was an "A" felony, whether it would be concurrentlike the other "A" felonies, such that it would change theoverall consecutive sentence (
with only one "B" felony
providing only "one" 10 year term in that grade of offense). 
17. The Court finds that the trial court's sentence 
at sentencing hearing, [sic] does not match the judgmententered following conviction and the Court finds thissentence illegal. 
14 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The circuit court concluded: 
4. When the Court finds something in the record that
is clearly erroneous with regards to how the sentence was
determined (calculated), the trial court must review thepotentially illegal sentence. 
5. The Court holds that an inconsistency in the
sentence when based upon something other than the jury'sfinding, gives rise to an illegal sentence. 
. . . . 
7. The jury found that the kidnapping conviction was
an "A" felony, yet the trial court treated it as a "B"felony. 
Since "A" felonies were to be sentenced concur-
rently with each other, there is a discrepancy because therewould be only one "B" felony and no consecutive sentencingbetween two "B" felonies. Consecutive sentencing betweenthe different grade levels would be 20 + 10 +[ ]5, which isdifferent than the 45 imposed by the sentencing court. 
8. The Court holds that the trial court sentence at 
sentencing is inconsistent and/or does not reconcile withthe judgment entered and the jury's findings, and does notclearly denote the consecutive sentences. 
9. The Court holds that the sentence of [Smith] is
illegal and the Petition is granted. 
10. The sentence will be vacated simultaneously with

Resentencing 
On May 2, 2019, the circuit court entered the 2019 
Sentence in the Criminal Case. The sentence for kidnapping was 
increased from 10 to 20 years because of the jury's finding that Smith committed a class A felony rather than a class B felony, to run concurrently with the sentence for the other class A felonies (Counts 3-6 for sexual assault). The 10-year term for the sole remaining class B felony (Count 1 for assault in the first degree) was to run consecutively to the concurrent 20-year terms for the class A felonies. The 5-year sentences on the class C felonies (Counts 2 and 9) would run concurrently with each other 
15 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and concurrently with the consecutive sentences on Counts 1, 3-6, 
and 8. 
That resulted in Smith's total sentence being reduced 
from 45 to 30 years. Smith filed a notice of appeal on July 1, 2019. 
Motion to Reduce Sentence 
Also on July 1, 2019, in the Criminal Case, Smith filed 
his Motion to Reduce Sentence because of his medical condition, 
pursuant to HRPP Rule 35(b). The State opposed the motion. Smith filed reply and supplemental memoranda. The circuit court entered the Order Denying Motion to Reduce Sentence on September 20, 2019. Smith filed an amended notice of appeal the same day. 
APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
"An appellate court has an independent obligation to 
ensure jurisdiction over each case[.]" State v. Diaz, 128 
Hawai# i 215, 222, 286 P.3d 824, 831 (2012) (cleaned up). "The 
right of appeal in a criminal case is purely statutory and exists only when given by some constitutional or statutory provision." State v. Nicol, 140 Hawai# i 482, 485-86, 403 P.3d 259, 262-63 
(2017) (citations omitted). 
HRS § 641-11 (2016) provides for appeals from circuit 
court criminal proceedings: 
Any party aggrieved by the judgment of a circuit court
in a criminal matter may appeal to the intermediate
appellate court, subject to chapter 602, in the manner andwithin the time provided by the rules of court. The sentence of the court in a criminal case shall be the judgment. All appeals shall be filed with the clerk of thesupreme court and shall be subject to one filing fee. 
(Underscoring added.) 
In keeping with the identification of the "sentence"
as the "judgment" as relating to issues of timing ratherthan scope, appellate courts of this jurisdiction have notinterpreted HRS § 641-11 solely by considering whether ornot the relevant decision contained an order of punishmentor other formal pronouncement of guilt. Rather, . . . in 
16 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
determining whether dispositions are subject to appeal under
the statute, our courts have focused the inquiry on whetherthe relevant order terminated the proceedings in the caseand left nothing further to be accomplished by the lowercourt. 
Nicol, 140 Hawai# i at 492, 403 P.3d at 269 (underscoring added) 
(citations omitted). 
Thus, "considerations of finality are the 
primary focus in resolving questions of appealability under the 
[criminal appeal] statute." Id. at 487, 403 P.3d at 264. 
In 
addition, Rule 4 of the Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
(
HRAP) provides, in relevant part: 
(b) Appeals in criminal cases. 
(1) TIME FOR FILING . In a criminal case, the notice of
appeal shall be filed within 30 days after entry of the
judgment or order appealed from. 
Smith contends that the circuit court erroneously 
concluded (in the Order Denying Motion to Review Consecutive 
Sentence) that HRS § 706-668.5 requires only that the reviewing court determine whether consecutive sentencing was specifically imposed. Judge Cahill found that Judge Raffetto intended to impose consecutive sentencing. However, Judge Cahill also determined that the Original Sentence was illegal because Count 8 (kidnapping) had been sentenced as a class B felony, when it should have been sentenced as a class A felony based on the jury's answers to interrogatories. Judge Cahill directed Smith to refile the motion as an HRPP Rule 40 petition. 
The Order Denying Motion to Review Consecutive Sentence 
did not terminate the proceedings in the Criminal Case because the illegal sentence issue remained to be determined, albeit in an HRPP Rule 40 proceeding. The illegal sentence issue was resolved by entry of the 2019 Sentence on May 2, 2019. Smith obtained an extension of time until July 2, 2019, to file a notice of appeal. His notice of appeal was filed on July 1, 2019. The timely appeal from the 2019 Sentence also brought up for review the Order Denying Motion to Review Consecutive 
17 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Sentence. See State v. Adam
, 97 Hawai# i 475, 482, 40 P.3d 877, 
884 (2002) (stating the general rule that appeal from final 
judgment brings up for review all preceding interlocutory orders). 
Smith also contends that the circuit court abused its 
discretion by denying his Motion to Reduce Sentence. The Order Denying Motion to Reduce Sentence was entered on September 20, 2019. Smith filed an amended notice of appeal the same day. But "an amended notice of appeal relates back to the notice of appeal it purports to amend, it does not appeal an order, judgment, or decree entered subsequent to the notice of appeal it purports to amend." Enos v. Pac. Transfer & Warehouse, Inc., 80 Hawai# i 345, 
355–56, 910 P.2d 116, 126–27 (1996) (citation omitted). 
The 
Order Denying Motion to Reduce Sentence was a separately appealable post-judgment order. See State v. Kong, 
No. CAAP-15-
0000066, 2016 WL 6997646, at *2 (Haw. App. Nov. 29, 2016) (mem.), vacated on other grounds, 140 Hawai# i 103, 398 P.3d 692 (2017) 
(holding that post-judgment order denying HRPP Rule 35(b) motion to reduce sentence is appealable in its own right). 
Smith should 
have filed a new
 notice of appeal within 30 days from 
September 20, 2019. He did not. 
However, "[i]n numerous cases, and under varying cir-
cumstances, [the supreme] court and the ICA have heard appeals in criminal cases despite the fact that the attorney failed to perfect the appeal, or that the appeal was not timely filed." In 
re RGB, 123 Hawai# i 1, 60, 229 P.3d 1066, 1125 (2010) (citing 
cases). 
"The rationale underlying some of the . . . cases was 
that the defendant was denied due process due to counsel's failure to perfect the appeal." Id. Accordingly, we have 
jurisdiction to review Smith's appeal from the Order Denying Motion to Reduce Sentence, notwithstanding his counsel's imperfect attempt to file an appeal. Cf. (
Villados v. State, 148 
Hawai# i 386, 477 P.3d 826 (2020) (in HRPP Rule 40 proceeding, 
where ineffectiveness of counsel resulted in petitioner-
18 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
defendant's untimely application for writ of certiorari in direct 
appeal from conviction, petitioner-defendant should be entitled to re-petition for certiorari in direct appeal)); (
State v. 
Uchima, 147 Hawai# i 64, 464 P.3d 852 (2020) (asserting juris-
diction over untimely certiorari application where counsel admitted ineffective assistance by failing to effectuate timely filing)). 
STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
Sentencing 
A sentencing judge generally has broad discretion in
imposing a sentence. The applicable standard of review forsentencing or resentencing matters is whether the court com-mitted plain and manifest abuse of discretion in itsdecision. Factors which indicate a plain and manifest abuseof discretion are arbitrary or capricious action by thejudge and a rigid refusal to consider the defendant'scontentions. And, generally, to constitute an abuse it mustappear that the court clearly exceeded the bounds of reasonor disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to thesubstantial detriment of a party litigant. 
State v. Kong, 131 Hawai# i 94, 101, 315 P.3d 720, 727 (2013) 
(citations omitted). "The weight to be given the factors set 
forth in HRS § 706–606 in imposing sentence is a matter generally left to the discretion of the sentencing court, taking into consideration the circumstances of each case." Id.
 (citation 
omitted). 
Findings of Fact 
We review findings of fact under the "clearly errone-
ous" standard. Birano v. State, 143 Hawai# i 163, 181, 426 P.3d 
387, 405 (2018). 
A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when the 
record lacks substantial evidence to support the finding or when, 
despite some evidence to support the finding, we are left with the definite and firm conviction in reviewing all of the evidence that a mistake has been committed. Id. "[S]ubstantial evidence" 
is "credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable caution to 
19 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
support a conclusion." In re Grievance Arbitration Between State 
of 
Hawai# i Organization of Police Officers and County of Kaua# i, 
135 Hawai# i 456, 462, 353 P.3d 998, 1004 (2015) (citations omit-
ted). 
Conclusions of Law 
We review conclusions of law under the "right/wrong" 
standard. Estate of Klink ex rel. Klink v. State, 113 Hawai# i 
332, 351, 152 P.3d 504, 523 (2007). A conclusion of law that is 
supported by the trial court's findings of fact and reflects an application of the correct rule of law will not be overturned. Id. 
DISCUSSION 
Smith contends: 
(1) the circuit court erroneously 
concluded that HRS § 706-668.5 requires only that the reviewing court examine the original judgment to determine whether the sentencing court specifically imposed consecutive sentences;(2)
 the 2019 Sentence erroneously imposed a new sentence for 
kidnapping that was more severe than the Original Sentence;(3) the circuit court "abused its discretion in imposing a 
consecutive sentence, and should have entered a concurrent 
sentence on all charges" under Barrios; and (4) the circuit court 
abused its discretion by denying the Motion to Reduce Sentence. 
1. Order Denying Motion to
Review Consecutive Sentence 
Smith's first point of error challenges finding of fact 
no. 12 and conclusion of law no. 1 in the Order Denying Motion to 
Review Consecutive Sentence: 
12. The Court finds that under [an HRS § 706-668.5]
motion to review, the trial court only need go back and look
at the judgment and review whether the sentencing judgespecified consecutive sentences. The court finds that the 
sentencing judge intended to impose consecutive sentencing . 
. . . . 
20 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
1. The Court holds that a review under HRS § 706-
668.5 involves the court simply looking at whether the
defendant's judgment specified that the sentences were torun consecutive [sic]. 
(Emphasis added.) 
This point of error requires that we review the history 
of HRS § 706-668.5 ("Multiple sentence of imprisonment"). When 
the statute was enacted in 1986, it provided, in relevant part: 
(1) If multiple terms of imprisonment are imposed on a
defendant at the same time, or if a term of imprisonment is
imposed on a defendant who is already subject to anunexpired term of imprisonment, the terms may run concur-rently or consecutively. Multiple terms of imprisonmentimposed at the same time  run concurrently  unless the court 
orders or the statute mandates that the terms run consecu-tively. Multiple terms of imprisonment imposed at different 
times  run consecutively  unless the court orders that the 
terms run concurrently. 
HRS § 706-668.5 (Supp. 1986) (bold italics added.) 
The statute was amended in 2008: 
(1) If multiple terms of imprisonment are imposed on a
defendant, whether at the same time[,] or at differenttimes, or if a term of imprisonment is imposed on adefendant who is already subject to an unexpired term ofimprisonment, the terms may run concurrently or consecu-tively. Multiple terms of imprisonment [imposed at the sametime] run concurrently  unless the court orders or the 
statute mandates that the terms run consecutively.[Multiple terms of imprisonment imposed at different timesrun consecutively unless the court orders that the terms runconcurrently.] 
2008 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 193, § 1 at 714 (additions look like 
this, [deletions look like this]) (bold italics added); see also HRS § 706-668.5 (Supp. 2008). The amendment took effect on June 18, 2008. Id. § 4. 
In 2015, the legislature passed Act 194, which added a 
new subsection (3) to HRS § 706-668.5: 
(3) For terms of imprisonment imposed prior to
June 18, 2008, the department of public safety shall post
written notice in all inmate housing units and the facilitylibrary at each correctional facility for a period of twomonths and send written notice to the defendant no later than January 1, 2016, that shall include but not be limitedto: 
21 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(a) Notice that the department of public safety may
recalculate the multiple terms of imprisonment imposedon the defendant; and 
(b) Notice of the defendant's right to have the courtreview the defendant's sentence.

https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/slh/Years/SLH2015/SLH2015_Act194.pdf .  
The legislative committee report states: 
The purpose and intent of this measure is to: 
(1) Require multiple terms of imprisonment imposed
on a defendant prior to June 18, 2008, to runconcurrently unless the court orders  or statute 
mandates that the terms run consecutively [.] 
. . . . 
Your Committees find that from 1986 through 2008,
section 706-668.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS), providedmultiple terms of imprisonment imposed at different times torun consecutively unless the court specifically ordered thatthe terms run concurrently. On June 18, 2008, Act 193,Session Laws of Hawaii 2008 (Act 193), was enacted, andsection 706-668.5, HRS, was amended to provide multipleterms of imprisonment to run concurrently unless the courtorders or the statute mandates that the terms run consecu-tively. Accordingly, for multiple terms of imprisonment,
the default sentencing changed from the terms running con-secutively to running concurrently  unless the court or 
statute specifically mandated otherwise. Due to concerns regarding inconsistencies in determining whether multipleimprisonment sentences were to be served concurrently orconsecutively, this measure attempts to treat defendants
sentenced to multiple terms of imprisonment prior toJune 18, 2008, the same as those defendants sentenced on andafter June 18, 2008.

similarly states: 
This measure attempts to bring parity to the treatment of
defendants sentenced to multiple terms prior to the effec-tive date of Act 193, which is June 18, 2008, and thosesentenced to multiple terms after that date while providingdefendants with adequate notice regarding the possibility oftheir multiple terms of imprisonment being recalculated bythe Department and their rights to have the court reviewtheir sentences.

Judge Cahill's statements during Smith's resentencing 
hearing were consistent with the legislature's stated intent 
behind Act 194: 
Isn't the whole purpose of [HRS § 706-668.5] . . .
because the DPS [Department of Public Safety] and the
paroling authority does [sic] not have access to thetranscripts unless they're ordered . . . it's the judgmentthat controls what the sentence is. 
Prior to 2008, if the . . . judgment did not specify
concurrent sentences or was left blank, the default was thatthe defendant was sentenced to consecutive sentence [sic].That's the law, right? That's what was done. 
. . . . 
. . . But then they changed the law and said that the
default position will now be, is if the judgment does notspecify consecutive or concurrent, the default will be thatit is concurrent sentences. 
And when the new statute comes in in 2015, the
legislature says to these folks that are in prison, oh,you've got to give them notice because your sentence may bereviewed or recalculated by DPS, but there's no guidance,there's nothing to indicate what's going to be done. What are they supposed to look at? 
Well, the only thing that DPS could be looking at is
the judgment. And it appears that . . . the legislaturesaid, look, there might be an area of unfairness here
because someone sentenced . . . on June 17th, 2008, wherethe judgment didn't specify what the sentence would be,would get consecutive sentences, and someone sentenced onJune 19th, the day after the statute went into effect in2008, and it didn't specify, would get concurrent sentences,even if the -- even if the crimes were exactly the same . As 
a matter of fact, even if it was the same defendant and thesame judge, it would just be automatic. 
And I think they said, well, look, that doesn't look
to be too fair, so you can go back and have a Court review. 
. . . [I]sn't really the function at this point is to
go back and look at the judgment, which in this case it'sconsecutive, but then look at what the sentencing judge didto determine whether [the judge] specified consecutivesentences, and if [the judge] did, then that's the onlyreview [the defendant]'s entitled to under this new law, notunder a Rule 40 illegality of sentence? 
I think that's a 
separate issue.

(Bold italics added.) 
Smith was originally sentenced on November 20, 2002, to 
multiple terms of imprisonment. At that time HRS § 706-668.5 
stated that the terms were to run concurrently "unless the court orders . . . that the terms run consecutively." HRS § 706-668.5 (1993). The Original Sentence entered by Judge Raffetto specified: 
COUNTS 3, 4, 5, AND 6 TO RUN CONSECUTIVE TO COUNTS 1 AND 8
AND COUNTS 2 AND 9, FOR A TOTAL OF FORTY-FIVE (45) YEARS. 
Judge Cahill reviewed the Original Sentence and correctly found 
that Judge Raffetto ordered Smith to serve consecutive sentences. Finding of fact no. 12 was not clearly erroneous. 
We also hold that conclusion of law no. 1 correctly 
applied Act 194 to the facts of this case, where the Original Sentence specified which of the multiple terms of imprisonment were to run consecutively.
21 Smith was not serving consecutive 
prison terms by default under the pre-June 18, 2008 version of HRS § 706-668.5; the Original Sentence specifically ordered the consecutive terms. The Order Denying Motion to Review Consecutive Sentence is affirmed. 
2. 2019 Sentence 
Smith acknowledges that the jury found he did not 
voluntarily release CW, not suffering from serious or substantial bodily injury, in a safe place prior to trial, and that count 8 (kidnapping) should accordingly have been sentenced as a class A felony (20 years) rather than a class B felony (10 years).
22 He 
21 We express no opinion about how a court reviewing an Act 194
petition should proceed in a case in which multiple terms of imprisonment were
imposed before June 18, 2008, but the judgment did not specify whether theterms were to be served consecutively or concurrently with a previouslyimposed sentence. 
22 The State did not challenge the Original Sentence, possibly
because Judge Raffetto imposed the 10-year class B felony kidnapping sentenceto be served consecutively with the 20-year class A felony sentences and to

makes several arguments about why Judge Cahill erred by 
increasing his kidnapping sentence from 10 years to 20 years. The one we find dispositive is based upon HRS § 706-609 (2014). That statute provides: 
When a conviction or sentence is set aside on direct or 
collateral attack, the court shall not impose a new sentencefor the same offense, or for a different offense based onthe same conduct, which is more severe than the priorsentence. 
HRS § 706–609 "prevents a sentencing court from issuing 
a more severe sentence after the initial sentence has been set 
aside upon review." State v. Samonte, 83 Hawai# i 507, 542, 928 
P.2d 1, 36 (1996) (citing Keawe v. State, 79 
Hawai# i 281, 289, 
901 P.2d 481, 489 (1995)). The statute "reflects a strong policy in favor of protecting a defendant's exercise of the right to challenge [their] conviction or sentence by restricting the sentencing court's discretion so as to guard against deterring or chilling a defendant's exercise of the right to mount such a challenge." Fukusaku v. State, 126 Hawai# i 555, 563, 273 P.3d 
1241, 1249 (App. 2012). In Fukusaku we noted that: 
The commentary to HRS § 706–609 explains that there
are three reasons for adopting this rule: 
First, the only argument which can justify an increase
following a re-trial is that the original sentence was toolight, either because the first judge was too lenient orbecause new facts have been presented. However, the onlyclass of persons who are vulnerable to this argumentconsists of those who have exercised the right to challengetheir convictions. There is no basis for believing thatthere exists any rational correspondence between this groupand those offenders who may indeed deserve an increase. 
Second, the risk of a greater sentence as the result of the
assertion of the right of review necessarily acts as adeterrent to the exercise of the right. 
Third, a contrary position would require the difficult
inquiry into the motivation of the judge who imposed the newsentence. Although it is clear that greater punishmentshould not be inflicted on the defendant because [they have]asserted [their] right to appeal, some judges have imposed 
the other class B felony sentence (for assault). 
25 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
harsher sentences because of lack of sympathy with the
constitutional rights asserted by some defendants, and in afrank attempt to minimize the numbers who will assert suchrights in the future. Therefore adopting a contraryposition would necessitate in every case a factual inquiryto determine the motivation of the judge who imposed the newsentence. 
Id. at 562–63, 273 P.3d at 1248–49 (cleaned up and reformatted). 
Here, Smith collaterally attacked the Original Sentence 
based upon HRS § 706-668.5(3). Judge Cahill correctly found that 
Judge Raffetto ordered Smith to serve consecutive sentences. In so doing, however, Judge Cahill reviewed the transcript of Smith's original sentencing hearing and concluded that Judge Raffetto erroneously sentenced Smith to 10 years on the kidnapping charge, rather than the 20 years that the jury's interrogatory answers mandated. At the continued hearing on Smith's Motion to Review Consecutive Sentence, Judge Cahill stated: 
Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Tengan, who tried this case, was
very diligent, pointed out to the judge that the juryanswered the question that the State had proved beyond areasonable doubt the three elements to make this an A kidnap-- an A felony, not a B felony. 
During the sentence, the judge said, well, I'm giving
[Smith] ten years on the kidnapping. [DPA] Tengan then says,well, Judge, wait, the jury found this. And he said, well,I sat through the trial and that's not what I remember. 
Recollections fade and it was erroneous. 
Judge Cahill correctly concluded that the erroneous sentence was 
illegal. (State v. Delmondo, 67 Haw. 531, 533, 696 P.2d 344, 346 (1985) (noting when a sentence imposed does not comply with statutory requirements, the sentence is illegal)); (State v. Fry, 61 Haw. 226, 229, 602 P.2d 13, 16 (1979) (holding that sentence not conforming to statute was illegal)). 
Under HRPP Rule 35(a), "[t]he court may correct an 
illegal sentence at any time[.]" Judge Cahill's correction to Smith's illegal sentence, however, conflicted with the plain language of HRS § 706–609. Under HRS § 706-609, it was error for 
26 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Judge Cahill to increase Smith's kidnapping sentence from 10 to 
20 years after Smith collaterally attacked the Original Sentence. We vacate the 2019 Sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with this opinion. 
3. Consecutive Sentences 
"A sentencing court has discretion to order multiple 
terms of imprisonment to run concurrently or consecutively. Kong, 131 Hawai# i at 101, 315 P.3d at 727 (citing HRS § 706-668.5 
(Supp. 2008)). 
Smith contends that Judge Cahill did not 
"adequately explain [his] rationale for imposing consecutive sentences." The supreme court has held that "a [sentencing] court must state its reasons as to why a consecutive sentence rather than a concurrent one was required." State v. Hussein, 
122 Hawai# i 495, 509, 229 P.3d 313, 327 (2010). "[A] sentencing 
court should explain its rationale for each consecutive sentence in order to inform the defendant and appellate courts of the specific factors underlying each sentence." Barrios, 139 Hawai# i 
at 337, 389 P.3d at 932. 
HRS § 706-606 (2014) provides: 
The court, in determining the particular sentence to be
imposed, shall consider: 
(1) The nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of thedefendant; 
(2) The need for the sentence imposed: 
(a) To reflect the seriousness of the 
offense, to promote respect for law,and to provide just punishment forthe offense; 
(b) To afford adequate deterrence tocriminal conduct; 
(c) To protect the public from furthercrimes of the defendant; and 
27 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(d) To provide the defendant with needed
educational or vocational training,medical care, or other correctionaltreatment in the most effective manner; 
(3) The kinds of sentences available; and 
(4) The need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similarrecords who have been found guilty of similarconduct. 
With respect to HRS § 706-606, the supreme court has also held: 
[T]he sentencing court is not required to articulate andexplain its conclusions with respect to every factor listedin HRS § 706-606. Rather, it is presumed that a sentencingcourt will have considered all factors before imposingconcurrent or consecutive terms of imprisonment under HRS§ 706–606. Thus, the sentencing court is required toarticulate its reasoning only with respect to those factorsit relies on in imposing consecutive sentences. 
Kong, 131 Hawai# i at 102, 315 P.3d at 728 (cleaned up). 
When resentencing Smith, Judge Cahill explained: 
This was a trial before a jury. I read the entire transcript that [Smith's counsel] uploaded for his appeal.I read the first day, I read the jury selection, thetestimony of every witness, the closing arguments. . . . 
. . . . 
This was a horrific crime. 
And the jury convicted
him. And I realize Mr. Smith has stood steadfast on some of the matters that the jury convicted him of. 
But nonethe-
less, the conviction is there. It stood the test of an appeal. And more importantly, it stood the test of time. 
The child in this case was the child of the defendant 
and the victim, [CW]. What as [sic] horrible circumstance.In the PSI [presentence investigation], [CW] wrote anoriginal letter. And in the original letter, she asked forthe maximum. So this change of heart may be as a result oftime, but it's somewhat questionable at this point. 
I have some concerns that the victim is being asked to
be the person who is put on the spot to determine thesentence. In other words, it's your fault he's serving theconsecutive sentence because that's what you asked for. I realize that wasn't the intent. And let's just say, I won'ttake it as that, but I do have some concerns about that. 
In the original PSI, [CW] wrote a letter. I think she 
appeared at sentencing as well. I don't recall off the topof my head, but she said in there that she had her child 
28 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
under some psychological care, that [the child] was
suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. 
. . . . 
On the morning of this crime when [CW] fled the house
to go seek help at the neighbors, it struck me as absolutely
incredible. 
She was so frightened, she left her three-year-
old [child] in the house with Mr. Smith, ran next door, theneighbor wasn't there, then ran across the street screamingfor help. The lady responded, got her husband to help. And the next thing that happened to [CW] was she looks and shesees her three-year-old exit the house [alone], and she ranto get [her child]. That's an extraordinary circumstance. 
. . . . 
Judge Raffetto imposed consecutive sentences. And 
consecutive sentences are appropriate in this case. 
. . . . . . . [I]n this particular case, I have reviewed the
sentencing factors under [HRS § ]706-606. 
And I have looked
very carefully at this record. And the sentence must 
reflect the seriousness of the offense to promote respectfor law and to provide just punishment for the offense.  
[Smith] was convicted of multiple sexual assaults in
the first degree upon the victim. He slashed her with a knife. 
And I understand she may have been released from the
hospital, but I was taken truly with Dr. Pedro Giron'stestimony. . . . 
He described where he had to pry open the victim's
eyes, the eyelids because they were so swollen that -- inorder to see whether there was any damage to the eye.That's how bad it was. She had slashes to her lower torsoand limbs. And then there were the threats that she testified to.  
. . . . 
So in considering sentencing to reflect the
seriousness of the crime, this was a horrific attack of
assault, and the victim was traumatized. 
. . . . 
So there must be adequate deterrence in a 20-year
sentence where there were repeated sexual assaults. 
But 
he's only going to be sentenced concurrent, as well as the
actual assault, which was separate and distinct, theslashing and the kidnapping, which is the A Felony. 
But for the fact that there was a mistake that it was 
considered as a B and not an A, I think the originalsentencing judge, if he had looked at the verdict form,would have given him multiple consecutives, including on theAs. Because he gave him consecutive on the B. And there would have been no mistake at all.

So to protect the public from further crimes of the
defendant, I realize the defendant's medical condition
debilitates [sic] against that. But nonetheless, there isand remains a potential threat to the victim. She, even inher affidavit, says I don't want my address disclosed. 
What other way could I take that is she still has a
fear? She still has a concern. And with that, thatmilitates in favor of a consecutive sentence. 
. . . . 
So in this particular case, on Counts Three, Four,
Five, and Six, for the crimes of Sexual Assault in the FirstDegree, it is a mandatory sentence. There are no optionsavailable to the Court for a probation. 
The defendant is sentenced to 20 years on each count.
And they are to all run concurrent with one another. 
In the Count Eight, Kidnapping, which is an A Felony,
the defendant is sentenced to 20 years in prison. 
And it is 
to run concurrent with Counts Three, Four, Five, and Six. 
On Count One, Assault in the First Degree, the
defendant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of tenyears. Count One will run consecutively to Counts Three,Four, Five, Six and Eight. I view that as a separate anddistinct, and the sheer magnitude of the assault andslashing that occurred warrants the consecutive sentence. 
The defendant was also convicted of Use of a Deadly or
Dangerous Weapon in the Commission of a Crime -- is that anA or is that a C Felony? 
[Defense counsel]: Which count? 
THE COURT: Nine. [Defense counsel]: Count Nine is a C Felony. THE COURT: Okay. The defendant will be sentenced to 
five years in prison, to run concurrently with all other
sentences. 
In Count Two, Terroristic Threatening in the First
Degree, the defendant is sentenced to a five-year term ofimprisonment. 
And although I do think there might be
grounds to consider that as separate and apart because itdid take place separately, it did occur as the other eventswere happening, the threats, death to the victim. That sentence will run five years open and concurrent with allother sentences. 
So the record is clear, the defendant is sentenced to
20 years on the A Felonies; on the C Felonies, five years.All of those to run concurrent. But the Count One, Assaultin the First Degree is a ten-year sentence to runconsecutive to all other sentences.

We reject Smith's argument that Judge Cahill did not 
adequately explain his rationale for imposing consecutive 
sentences. Smith's third point of error is without merit. 
4. Order Denying Motion to Reduce Sentence 
Smith contends that the circuit court abused its dis-
cretion by denying his Motion to Reduce Sentence  based upon his 
medical condition. The motion was based upon Smith's diagnosis of throat cancer, for which he underwent a laryngopharyngectomy (removal of the vocal cords and pharynx) and a tracheostomy (an incision made in the windpipe). 
He is unable to speak and must 
breath through a hole in his throat. His doctor opined that he has stage 3 cancer and that his five-year survival rate is 25%. 23
A defendant's "medical circumstances . . . are [not] 
compulsory mitigators." State v. Kahapea, 111 Hawai# i 267, 281, 
141 P.3d 440, 454 (2006). When Judge Raffetto imposed the Original Sentence he stated: 
As I mentioned, I presided over trial, so I heard all
of the testimony, and it is true I don't think it can be
disputed that defendant acted with a real high level ofcruelty toward the victim here. 
. . . . 
Until today he has shown no remorse, whatsoever, or
more importantly any insight into the wrongfulness of his
behavior, and still seems to blame the victim for much ofwhat happened, and he accepted responsibility today which isa good sign, but he hasn't before today, and then hecontacted defendant [sic] in violation of the court orderafter the time he was convicted. 
The Court believes and finds, therefore, that the
defendant does, in fact, present a clear and present dangerto the victim in this case and to the community, and thathis likelihood of rehabilitation at least at the presenttime is very low. 
Taking into consideration all of the factors set forth
in Hawaii Revised Statutes Section 706-606, particularly theneed for the sentence to reflect the very seriousness of theoffenses committed here, it is another human being and to 
23 Smith's HRPP Rule 35 Motion to Reduce Sentence was timely filed
within 90 days after entry of the 2019 Sentence.

protect the community the Court is going to impose sentence
as follows: 
The defendant will be placed in the custody of the
director of the Department of Public Safety for a . . .total period of forty-five years. 
During the hearing on the motion for reduction of 
sentence, Judge Cahill stated: 
[T]here's no legal basis that the medical condition of thedefendant at this point should cause a reconsideration ofthe sentence. . . . 
. . . . 
. . . [T]hese are mandatory prison sentences that were
imposed. He was convicted of the A Felony. So then the only issue was the consecutives. And I made my findings onthat. And I see no reason to change it. 
. . . . 
So respectfully, the motion for reconsideration [sic]
is denied for the reasons placed on the record. But the record should reflect, I did consider all of the medicalevidence as well. I just don't feel that the medicalevidence warrants reconsideration [sic] of the sentence. 
We cannot say, based on the record, that the circuit court abused 
its discretion by denying Smith's motion for reduction of his sentence based on his medical condition. 
CONCLUSION 
Based upon the foregoing: the Order Denying Motion to 
Review Consecutive Sentence entered on November 21, 2018, is affirmed; the 2019 Sentence entered on May 2, 2019, is vacated; the Order Denying Motion to Reduce Sentence, entered on

of Smith IV, which remanded the case for the State to either "remedy themerger-instruction error by dismissing one of the two counts that couldpotentially merge [(Counts 1 (assault) and 8 (kidnapping))] or, if the Statechooses, the State may retry Smith on both counts." Smith IV, 2020 WL
