JUNE 23, 2023 
HIRAOKA, PRESIDING JUDGE, NAKASONE AND MCCULLEN, JJ. 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY HIRAOKA, J. 
This appeal involves a claim for dependents' death 
benefits under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 § 386-41 (2015), 
part of the Hawai# i Workers' Compensation Law. In Survivors of 
Young v. Island Feeling, Inc., 109 Hawai# i 255, 125 P.3d 476 
(2005), as corrected  (Jan. 26, 2006), the supreme court held that   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the maximum weekly benefit rate (
MWBR) on the date of the 
employee's death, rather than the date of injury, applies to 
dependents' death benefits. Id. at 260, 125 P.3d at 481. This 
appeal involves a dispute over how the amount of a dependent's weekly death benefit is to be calculated under the statute. 
I. BACKGROUND 
Paul Jokiel was employed by Employer-Appellant/ 
Appellant University of Hawai# i.  He died on April 28, 2016. His 
surviving spouse, Carole Ann 
 Jokiel, made a workers' compensation 
claim for dependents' death benefits. The University of Hawai# i 
and Insurance Carrier-Appellant/Appellant FiRMS Claims Services 
(together, UH) made a claim for contribution from Appellee/ 
Appellee/Cross-Appellant Special Compensation Fund (SCF).1 
The Director of the Department of Labor and Industrial 
Relations awarded Carole Ann weekly benefits of $812 for 312 
weeks, for a total of $253,344, from UH. The Director concluded that SCF was not liable for benefits. 
UH appealed the Director's decision to the Labor and 
Industrial Relations Appeals Board (LIRAB). UH and SCF settled 
their dispute over apportionment of benefits. The remaining 
issue before LIRAB was: "What is the proper calculation of [Carole Ann]'s death benefit rate for this claim[?]" 
UH filed a motion for partial summary judgment, in 
which SCF joined. They sought "to correct the [weekly] death benefit calculation [from $812] to $608.97[.]" A majority of LIRAB denied the motion, with the Chair dissenting. 
LIRAB issued its Decision and Order on March 8, 2019. 
The majority concluded that "the proper . . . weekly death benefit rate . . . is $1,186.39." LIRAB's Chair dissented,

§ 386-151(a) (2015). 
It is funded by annual levies upon workers' compensation
insurers, HRS § 386-153 (2015), and uninsured employers and self-insurance
groups, HRS § 386-154 (2015).

determining that Carole Ann should have been awarded "weekly 
dependent benefits of $608.97[.]" 
UH and SCF filed a joint motion for reconsideration. 
LIRAB denied reconsideration on June 21, 2019, with the Chair dissenting. 
UH appealed, and SCF cross-appealed.2 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW 
Appellate review of a LIRAB decision is governed by the 
provisions of HRS § 91-14(g). Survivors of Young, 109 Hawai# i at 
258, 125 P.3d at 479 (applying HRS § 91–14(g) (1993)). 
The 
statute currently provides: 
Upon review of the record, the court may affirm the decision
of the agency or remand the case with instructions forfurther proceedings; or it may reverse or modify thedecision and order if the substantial rights of thepetitioners may have been prejudiced because theadministrative findings, conclusions, decisions, or ordersare: 
(1) In violation of constitutional or statutory
provisions; 
(2) In excess of the statutory authority or
jurisdiction of the agency; 
(3) Made upon unlawful procedure; 
(4) Affected by other error of law;
 
(5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,
probative, and substantial evidence on the whole
record; or 
(6) Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized by
abuse of discretion or clearly unwarrantedexercise of discretion. 
HRS § 91-14(g) (Supp. 2021). 
UH and SCF challenge LIRAB's interpretation of HRS 
§ 386-41. "Statutory interpretation is a question of law 
reviewable de novo." Survivors of Young, 109 Hawai# i at 259, 125 
P.3d at 480 (citation omitted).

When construing a statute, our foremost obligation is to
ascertain and give effect to the intention of thelegislature, which is to be obtained primarily from thelanguage contained in the statute itself. And we must read statutory language in the context of the entire statute andconstrue it in a manner consistent with its purpose. 
Id. at 260, 125 P.3d at 481 (citation omitted). 
III. DISCUSSION 
A. Statutory Language 
HRS § 386-41 (2015) provides, in relevant part: 
(b) Weekly benefits for dependents. In addition,
the employer shall pay weekly benefits to the deceased'sdependents at the percentages of the deceased's average
weekly wages specified below , taking into account not more
than the maximum weekly benefit rate prescribed in section386-31 divided by .6667 and not less than the minimumprescribed in the section divided by .6667.[
3] 
To the dependent widow, widower, or reciprocal
beneficiary, if there are no dependent children, fifty per
cent. 
(Emphasis added.) The record does not indicate that Paul and 
Carole Ann had any dependent children. 
LIRAB found, and UH and SCF do not dispute, that Paul's 
average weekly wages (AWW) were $2,372.77. Thus, for purposes of 
HRS § 386-41(b), the "percentages of the deceased's [AWW] 
specified below" are ($2,372.77 x .50) or $1,186.39. That was Carole Ann's weekly death benefit rate calculated by the LIRAB majority. 
HRS § 386-41(b), however, "cap[s] death benefits by 
reference to 'the maximum weekly benefit rate prescribed in section 386–31.'" Survivors of Young, 109 Hawai# i at 261, 125 
P.3d at 482. HRS § 386-31 (2015) provides, in relevant part: 
(a) Permanent total disability. Where a work injury causes
permanent total disability the employer shall pay the
injured employee a weekly benefit equal to sixty-six andtwo-thirds per cent of the employee's average weekly wages,subject to the following limitation : 
3 The minimum weekly benefit rate is not relevant to this case. 
4  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Beginning January 1, 1975, and during each succeeding
twelve-month period thereafter, not more than the state 
average weekly wage  last determined by the director, rounded
to the nearest dollar, nor less than $38 or twenty-five per
cent of the foregoing maximum amount, rounded to the nearestdollar, whichever is higher. 
(Emphasis added.) "[T]he MWBR used to calculate death benefits 
is the state [AWW] last determined by the director at the time of death." Survivors of Young, 109 Hawai# i at 261, 125 P.3d at 482. 
The parties agree that the state AWW for 2016 (the year Paul died) was 
$812.00. That was Carole Ann's weekly death benefit 
rate as calculated by the Director. 
However, the HRS § 386-41(b) weekly benefit limit is 
"the [MWBR] prescribed in section 386-31 divided by .6667
[.]" 
(Emphasis added.) The 2016 MWBR, $812.00, divided by .6667 equals $1,217.94. The $1,217.94 benefit limit is greater than fifty per cent of Paul's AWW ($1,186.39). Accordingly, under HRS § 386-41(b), Carole Ann is entitled to a dependent death benefit of $1,186.39 per week. The LIRAB majority's calculation was consistent with Survivors of Young and the plain language of HRS §§ 386-41 and 386-31. 
UH and SCF rely on Survivors of Okimoto v. State, Dep't 
of Transp., Case No. AB 80-81 (2-78-26114). They argue that under Survivors of Okimoto, because Paul's AWW ($2,372.77) were more than the 2016 HRS § 386-41(b) weekly benefit limit ($1,217.94), the latter amount should be reduced by fifty per cent to calculate Carole Ann's dependent death benefit of $608.97 under HRS § 386-41(b). But this runs counter to the plain language of HRS § 386-41(b). The "taking into account" language in the statute compares "the percentages of the deceased's [AWW] specified below" (in this case, $1,186.39) — not the deceased's 
straight AWW — with the weekly benefit limit (in this case, $1,217.94). The calculation in Survivors of Okimoto is contrary to the plain language of HRS §§ 386-31 and 386-41. 
UH makes an argument about the amendments to the 
Hawai#i Workers' Compensation Law since 1955 and the "formulaic 
expression contained in HRS § 386-41(b)" after the 1974 
5 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
amendments. 
But UH appears to misapply the statutory language by 
multiplying the state AWW by .66674 instead of dividing by .66675 
to obtain the maximum weekly dependent death benefit rate, as 
required by HRS § 386-41(b); and by multiplying Paul's AWW by .6667
6 instead of reducing it by "fifty per cent"7 to obtain "the 
percentages of the deceased's average weekly wages specified below" as required by HRS § 386-41(b) for a dependent widow with no dependent children. UH's calculations are contrary to the plain language of HRS § 386-41(b) applicable to this case. 
B. Legislative Intent 
SCF makes an argument about legislative history and 
intent, with which UH agrees. Legislative history is useful to "discern the underlying policy which the legislature seeks to promulgate and, thus, . . . determine if a literal construction would produce an absurd or unjust result, inconsistent with the policies of the statute." Survivors of Medeiros v. Maui Land & 
Pineapple Co., 66 Haw. 290, 297, 660 P.2d 1316, 1321 (1983). 
A large number of cases have recognized that our workers'
compensation statute has a beneficent purpose and should beafforded liberal construction in favor of the employee, tofulfill the humanitarian purposes for which it was enacted.Indeed, since the supreme court's first look at Hawaii'sthen new workers' compensation statute in 1916, analyses inthese kinds of cases have been grounded on the humanitarianpurposes premise. 
Survivors of Young, 109 Hawai# i at 261, 125 P.3d at 482 (citation 
omitted). 
The result we reach under the plain language of HRS 
§§ 386-31 and 386-41 allows the spouse of a deceased employee who 
was earning more than the state AWW to receive compensation 
4 Which reduces the amount from $812 to $541.36. 
5 Which increases the amount from $812 to $1,217.94.  
6 Which reduces the amount from $2,372.77 to $1,581.93.  
 7 Which reduces the amount from $2,372.77 to $1,186.39.
6 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
consistent with the humanitarian purposes of the workers' 
compensation law. 
Under UH's and SCF's interpretation of the 
law, Carole Ann would receive a weekly benefit almost fifty per cent less ($608.97) than the weekly benefit amount established by the plain language of the law ($1,186.39). Our analysis does not produce "an absurd and unjust result . . . clearly inconsistent with the purposes and policies of the statute." Survivors of 
Medeiros, 66 Haw. at 297, 660 P.2d at 1321 (citations omitted). Rather, it is consistent with the humanitarian purposes for which the workers' compensation law was enacted. It is UH's and SCF's interpretations that are inconsistent with the humanitarian purposes for which the Hawai# i Workers' Compensation Law was 
enacted. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the "Decision and 
Order" of the LIRAB majority, filed on March 8, 2019, and the "Order Denying Motion for Reconsideration" of the LIRAB majority, filed on June 21, 2019.
