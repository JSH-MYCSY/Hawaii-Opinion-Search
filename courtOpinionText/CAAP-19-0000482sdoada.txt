OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
FU XIANG HE, Defendant-Appellant 
A
PPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(HONOLULU DIVISION)
(CASE NO. 1DTA-18-02761) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Fu Xiang He (He
) appeals from the 
Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, 
entered June 20, 2019 (Judgment), in the District Court of the 
First Circuit, Honolulu Division (District Court).1 He was 
convicted of operating a vehicle under the influence of an

intoxicant (OVUII), as a first offense, in violation of Hawaii 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1), (b)(1) (Supp. 2018).2  
He raises a single point of error on appeal, contending 
that the District Court erred in taking judicial notice of the 
court minutes from a prior District Court case, 1DTA-16-04155. Upon careful review of the record and the briefs submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve He's point of error as follows: 
2/ HS § 291E-61 stated at the time of the offense, in relevant part: 
§ 291E-61 Operating a vehicle under the influence of
an intoxicant.  (a) A person commits the offense of
operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if
the person operates or assumes actual physical control of avehicle: 
(1) While under the influence of alcohol in an amount sufficient to impair the person's normalmental faculties or ability to care for theperson and guard against casualty[.] 
. . . . 
(b) A person committing the offense of operating a
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant shall be sentenced without possibility of probation or suspension ofsentence as follows: 
(1) For the first offense, or any offense notpreceded within a five-year period by aconviction for an offense under this section or section 291E-4(a): 
. . . . 
(C) Any one or more of the following: 
. . . . 
(ii) Not less than forty-eight hours andnot more than five days ofimprisonment[.] 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In the District Court proceedings in this case, 1DTA-
18-02761, He challenged the timeliness of the commencement of the 
prosecution pursuant to HRS §§ 701-108 (2014) and 701-114 (2014). HRS § 701-114 sets forth what the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt to convict a defendant, and provides: 
§ 701-114 Proof beyond a reasonable doubt. (1) Except
as otherwise provided in section 701-115, no person may be
convicted of an offense unless the following are proved beyonda reasonable doubt: 
(a) Each element of the offense; 
(b) The state of mind required to establish each
element of the offense; 
(c) Facts establishing jurisdiction; (d) Facts establishing venue; and (e) Facts establishing that the offense was
committed within the time period specified in
section 701-108. 
(2) In the absence of the proof required by
subsection (1), the innocence of the defendant is presumed. 
(Emphasis added). 
HRS § 701-108(2)(f) applies to the first-offense OVUII 
charge against He and provides that "[a] prosecution for a petty 
misdemeanor or a violation other than a parking violation must be commenced within one year after it is committed." 
Here, the charged offense was alleged to have occurred 
on November 18, 2016, and the State filed the Complaint in 1DTA-18-02761 on August 22, 2018. After the State rested its case and made closing arguments, He argued that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the requirement set forth in HRS § 701-
114(1)(e), i.e., that the prosecution was timely. The State 
3  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
conceded that it had not adduced evidence to meet the timely-
commencement requirement, but argued that the court could take 
judicial notice, pursuant to Hawai# i Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 
201, of the records in 1DTA-16-04155 to establish the timeliness 
of the prosecution in this case.   The District Court took 
judicial notice of the records in 1DTA-16-04155 and found that the State filed the complaint against He within the statute of limitations. 3
He argues that the District Court erred when it took 
judicial notice, because: (1) there was no evidence that 1DTA-
3/ HRE Rule 201 provides: 
Rule 201 Judicial notice of adjudicative facts.  (a)
Scope of rule. 
This rule governs only judicial notice of
adjudicative facts. 
(b) Kinds of facts. A judicially noticed fact must
be one not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is
either (1) generally known within the territorialjurisdiction of the trial court, or (2) capable of accurateand ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracycannot reasonably be questioned. 
(c) When discretionary. 
A court may take judicial
notice, whether requested or not. 
(d) When mandatory. A court shall take judicial
notice if requested by a party and supplied with thenecessary information. 
(e) Opportunity to be heard. A party is entitled
upon timely request to an opportunity to be heard as to thepropriety of taking judicial notice and the tenor of thematter noticed. In the absence of prior notification, therequest may be made after judicial notice has been taken. 
(f) Time of taking notice. Judicial notice may be
taken at any stage of the proceeding. 
(g) Instructing jury. In a civil proceeding, the
court shall instruct the jury to accept as conclusive anyfact judicially noticed. In a criminal case, the courtshall instruct the jury that it may, but is not required to,accept as conclusive any fact judicially noticed.

 16-04155 involved He or was based on the same incident as charged 
in 1DTA-18-02761; (2) the records in 1DTA-16-04155 were not "capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned" as required by HRE Rule 201; and (3) the State had already rested its case and made closing argument. We address each of these arguments in turn. 
As to He's first argument, the Complaint in 1DTA-16-
04155 and the Complaint in 1DTA-18-02761 were both filed against "Fu Xiang He;" both complaints allege the same offense, OVUII, and the same incident date of November 18, 2016; and both complaints reference the same Report/Citation No. 16454071-001. In addition, the Complaint in 1DTA-18-02761 specifically alleges that: "A prosecution against FU XIANG HE for the same conduct as alleged in this charge was pending in the State of Hawaii under Case number 1DTA-16-04155 from November 28, 2016[,] to and 
including July 13, 2018."  The Complaint in 1DTA-16-04155 bears a 
filed-stamp date of November 28, 2016, and the Notice of Entry of 
Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment in 1DTA-16-04155 dismissing the charge without prejudice bears a filed-stamp date of July 13, 2018. We conclude that the District Court did not err in its determination that 1DTA-16-04155 involved He and was based on the same incident as charged in 1DTA-18-02761 based upon its taking judicial notice of the records in those cases. 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
He's second argument is also without merit. The 
District Court's records of the filing dates of the Complaint and 
Judgment in 1DTA-16-04155, as well as the contents (not the merits) of the Complaint in 1DTA-16-04155 are capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy 
cannot reasonably be questioned, i.e., the court's own records and files in 1DTA-16-04155. See State v. Abdon, 137 Hawai# i 19, 
26, 364 P.3d 917, 924 (2016) ("The most frequent use of judicial 
notice of ascertainable facts is in noticing the content of court records."). 
Third, He argues that the District Court erred in 
taking judicial notice of the records in 1DTA-16-04155 after the prosecution closed its case. However, HRE Rule 201(f) specifically provides that "judicial notice may be taken at any stage of the proceeding." See also Abdon, 137 Hawai# i at 21-22, 
26-27, 364 P.3d at 919-20, 924-25 (concerning a trial court's post-verdict ruling on a motion for judgment for acquittal based on alleged failure to prove that the statute of limitations was not exceeded, holding that the Intermediate Court of Appeals erred in failing to take judicial notice of the date of the subject indictment); State v. Botelho, CAAP-18-0000285, 2019 WL 2119655, at *1 (Haw. App. May 15, 2019) (SDO). Accordingly, we conclude that this argument is without merit.
