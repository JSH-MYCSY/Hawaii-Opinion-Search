(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, and Wadsworth and Nakasone, JJ.) 
This appeal stems from a lease dispute between 
Plaintiffs/Counterclaim Defendants-Appellees Trustees of the 
Estate of Bernice Pauahi Bishop, doing business as Kamehameha Schools (KS), on the one hand, and Defendants/Counterclaimants-
Appellants Life of the Land Pacific, LLC (LOLP), Thomas F.

Y. Gagaza (together, the Gazagas), on the other hand.1/ 
Appellants appeal from the January 7, 2019 "Final Judgment in 
Favor of [KS] and Against [Appellants and the Gazagas]" (Judgment) and the June 27, 2019 "Order Granting [KS's] Motion 
for Attorneys' Fees and Costs" (Fees and Costs Order), both 
entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit.
2/ 
On appeal, Appellants contend that the Circuit Court 
erred in: (1) granting KS's motion for summary judgment on 
Appellants' counterclaims (MSJ on the Counterclaims) based on the 
conclusion that the subject leases (Leases) provided an 
unambiguous deadline for the completion of certain improvements 
to the leased premises (Premises); (2) granting KS's motion for 
summary judgment on its Complaint (MSJ on the Complaint) on the 
same basis; (3) denying Appellants' requests for continuances 
under Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 56(f); and (4) 
granting KS's January 18, 2019 motion for attorneys' fees and costs, after the 90-day period to resolve the motion under HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) had expired. 
After reviewing the record on appeal and the relevant 
legal authorities, and giving due consideration to the issues raised and the arguments advanced by the parties, we resolve Appellants' contentions as follows, affirming the Judgment and vacating the Fees and Costs Order. 
(1) and (2) Appellants' first and second points of 
error are based on the same argument – that in granting KS's respective motions for summary judgment, "[t]he Circuit Court erred in [concluding] . . . that the [L]eases for the properties unambiguously provided that LOLP had to have a hotel built by June 30, 2017." In particular, Appellants challenge paragraph 6 of the court's October 9, 2018 order granting the MSJ on the

Counterclaims/  and paragraphs 3-5 of the court's December 10, 
2018 order granting the MSJ on the Complaint.3
/ Appellants argue 
that the Circuit Court erred in reaching these conclusions 
because the Leases "were at least ambiguous" as to whether the June 30, 2017 deadline applied to LOLP's attempts to obtain a zoning change and to build hotels on the subject properties. 4
"A lease is reviewed under the principles of contract 
law when the issue involves the interpretation of a lease provision." Joy A. McElroy, M.D., Inc. v. Maryl Grp., Inc., 107 
Hawai#i 423, 429, 114 P.3d 929, 935 (App. 2005) (citing Pancakes 
of Hawaii, Inc. v. Pomare Properties Corp., 85 Hawai# i 300, 304, 
944 P.2d 97, 101 (App. 1997)). In such circumstances, the following contract principles apply: 
"[T]he construction and legal effect to be given a
contract is a question of law freely reviewable by an
appellate court." Brown v. KFC National Mgmt. Co., 82 
3/ Paragraph 6 states: 
The Leases provided that the lessee must develop the
leased property within 36 months of the Leases. The Leases provided, at bare minimum, apartment buildings must be putup on the parcels; namely, a 14-unit apartment building anda 16-unit apartment building. The Leases did leave the option, at the sole risk of the lessee, to build a hotel.But that was at the sole risk of the lessee, and it isclearly stated in the Leases. Whatever the lessee chose,the lessee had to complete it within three years. That is the plain reading of the lease contract. 
4/ Paragraphs 3-5 state: 
3. The critical term here is whether or not there 
were any extensions of time beyond June 2017, that weregranted by the lessors to the lessee when the lessee electedto pursue a different use of the properties than wasoriginally contemplated when the lessee entered into theleases with Plaintiffs. 
4. The leases are clear. The original development
purpose for the subject properties was an apartmentbuilding. The deadline to have that apartment buildingconstructed was October 2016. At some point the lesseedecided to pursue building a hotel on the same properties.Plaintiffs extended the deadline to June 2017. 
5. Plaintiffs' extension of the deadline was 
absolute. The Court plainly reads the leases, as extended,to state you can build a hotel if you are able to but, ifnot, get an apartment building up and running by June 2017.That did not occur. Therefore, the breach occurred as ofJune 2017.

whether a contract is ambiguous is likewise a question oflaw that is freely reviewable on appeal." Id. (citations

Contract terms are interpreted according to their
plain, ordinary, and accepted sense in common speech. Cho Mark Oriental Food v. K & K Intern., 73 Haw. 509, 520, 836P.2d 1057, 1064 (1992). The court's objective is "toascertain and effectuate the intention of the parties asmanifested by the contract in its entirety."

quotation marks omitted). 
A contract is ambiguous when its terms are reasonably
susceptible to more than one meaning. Airgo v. HorizonCargo Transp., 66 Haw. 590, 594, 670 P.2d 1277, 1280 (1983).As a general rule, the court will look no further than thefour corners of the contract to determine whether an ambiguity exists.

Hawaiian Ass'n of Seventh-Day Adventists v. Wong, 130 Hawai# i 36, 
45, 305 P.3d 452, 461 (2013). 
Here, the Leases were not ambiguous. Read in their 
entirety, the Leases plainly required LOLP to complete the 
construction and development of specified apartment buildings on the Premises by October 1, 2016. 
KS subsequently extended this 
deadline to June 30, 2017. Additionally, the Leases permitted LOLP, at its sole risk and at its sole cost and expense, to seek such zoning changes, permits, approvals and other entitlements as may be required for LOLP's proposed hotel use of the Premises. The Leases made clear, however, that if LOLP elected to seek such entitlements, it would be at its sole risk, and that LOLP's inability to obtain such entitlements would not limit or affect its obligations under the Leases. 
There is no dispute that LOLP did not complete the 
construction and development of the specified apartment buildings on the Premises by June 30, 2017.  Paragraph 6 of the October 9, 
2018 order granting the MSJ on the Counterclaims and paragraphs 
5/
5/   We reject Appellants' alternative argument that even if the
June 30, 2017 deadline applied to LOLP's proposed hotel use of the leased
premises, the "force majeure" clause of the Leases applied to delays inobtaining a zoning change, thereby excusing LOLP from building hotels by thedeadline. Among other things, LOLP's proposed hotel use was not an "actrequired under this Lease," so as to trigger the force majeure clause of theLeases.

3-5 of the December 10, 2018 order granting the MSJ on the 
Complaint are not wrong. Accordingly, Appellants' first and second points of error are without merit. 
(3) Appellants contend that "[t]he Circuit Court erred 
in denying LOLP's request to complete discovery pursuant to HRCP Rule 56(f) before ruling on [KS's] motions for summary judgment." 
[A] trial court's decision to deny a request for a
continuance pursuant to HRCP Rule 56(f) will not be reversedabsent an abuse of discretion. Additionally, the requestmust demonstrate how postponement of a ruling on the motionwill enable him or her, by discovery or other means, torebut the movants' showing of absence of a genuine issue ofmaterial fact.

Acoba v. Gen. Tire, Inc.
, 
92 Hawai#i 1, 9-10, 986 P.2d 288, 296-97 (1999)); 
see Exotics 
Hawaii-Kona, Inc. v. E.I. Du Pont De Nemours & Co.
, 116 Hawai#i 
277, 308, 172 P.3d 1021, 1052 (2007) (the party seeking a 
continuance under HRCP Rule 56(f) "
is required to show what 
specific facts further discovery might unveil" (quoting McCabe v. Macaulay,450 F. Supp. 2d 928, 933 (N.D. Iowa 2006))). 
Here, Appellants requested a Rule 56(f) continuance in 
a conclusory paragraph at the end of their memorandum in opposition to KS's MSJ on the Counterclaims. Neither the memorandum nor the accompanying declaration of counsel identified specific facts that discovery might unveil or explained how those facts would (or could) create a genuine issue of material fact as to the construction of the Leases. Appellants' memorandum in opposition to KS's MSJ on the Complaint similarly failed to show specific facts that further discovery might unveil, and did not include a declaration in support of Appellants' request for a Rule 56(f) continuance. 
On this record, we conclude that the Circuit Court did 
not abuse its discretion in denying Appellants' requests for continuances under HRCP Rule 56(f). 
(4) Appellants contend that "[t]he Circuit Court erred 
in granting [KS]'s motion for attorneys' fees . . . ." KS filed a motion for attorneys' fees and costs on January 18, 2019, pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(d) and Hawaii Revised Statutes §§ 607-9 
5   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
and 607-14. The Circuit Court entered the Fees and Costs Order 
on June 27, 2019, granting the motion in full. Appellants argue that the Circuit Court erred because the motion was not disposed of within 90 days of its filing date, and thus was deemed denied by operation of HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). 
Under HRAP Rule 4(a)(3), the Circuit Court had ninety 
days to resolve the January 18, 2019 motion for attorneys' fees and costs.
6/ See Cole v. City and Cnty. of Honolulu , 154 Hawai#i 
28, 31-32, 543 P.3d 460, 463-64 (2024) ("The second clause [of HRAP Rule 4(a)(3)] requires the court to enter that post-judgment order within 90 days after the party files the motion. . . . Courts have no power to rule on a post-judgment motion after the 90-day period. . . . [HRAP Rule 4(a)(3)] nullifies an order entered 90 days after a post-judgment motion."). The Circuit Court resolved the motion on June 27, 2019, more than 90 days after its filing date. Because the Fees and Costs Order was entered after expiration of the 90-day deadline in HRAP Rule 4(a)(3), it is "a nullity." HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). We therefore vacate the Fees and Costs Order. 
Although KS's motion for fees and costs is deemed 
denied by operation of HRAP Rule 4(a)(3), KS is not without recourse as to its asserted right to attorneys' fees and costs. In the circumstances here, and in light of prior Hawai
#i case 
law, we conclude it is appropriate to remand the case so that KS may reassert its claims for attorneys' fees and costs without prejudice from the deemed denial of its prior motion. See 
Victoria Ward Ctr., L.L.C., v. Gold Guys Holdings, LLC, Nos. CAAP-16-0000211, CAAP-16-0000581, CAAP-16-0000622, 2019 WL 2635689, at *12 (Haw. App. June 27, 2019) (mem.) (construing predecessor version of HRAP Rule 4(a)(3)); In re Int'l Union of Painters & Allied Trades, Painters Local Union 1791 v. Endo Painting Serv., Inc., Nos. CAAP-12-0000661, CAAP-12-0001094, 
6/ The motion was timely under HRCP Rule 54(d)(2)(A) and (B), which
requires that a motion for attorneys' fees and related nontaxable expenses be
filed and served no later than 14 days after entry of an appealable order orjudgment. With respect to its request for an award of costs, KS invoked bothHRCP Rule 54(d)(1) and 54(d)(2)(A). We thus treat the request for costs aspart of a motion extending the time for appeal ("tolling motion") under HRAPRule 4(a)(3).

January 7, 2019 "Final Judgment in Favor of Plaintiffs Trustees of the Estate of Bernice Pauahi Bishop, Doing Business As Kamehameha Schools and Against Defendants Life of the Land Pacific, LLC, Thomas F. Schmidt, Brigida A. Schmidt, Roy Y. Gagaza, and Patricia Y.
