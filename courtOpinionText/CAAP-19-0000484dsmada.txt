HOWARD M. PEDRO, SR., Claimant-Appellant/Appellant, v.
REEF DEVELOPMENT OF HAWAII, INC., Employer-Appellee/Appellee,
and TRAVELERS CASUALTY AND SURETY COMPANY,
Insurance Carrier-Appellee/Appellee
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
(CASE NO. AB 2017-184(K); DCD NO. 4-10-00846)
ORDER GRANTING SEPTEMBER 13, 2019 MOTION TO
DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Chan, JJ.)
Upon review of (1) Employer-Appellee/Appellee Reef
Development of Hawaii (Reef Development) and Insurance Carrier-
Appellee/Appellee Travelers Casualty and Surety Company's
(Travelers) September 13, 2019 motion to dismiss appeal for lack
of appellate jurisdiction, (2)  the lack of any memorandum by
Claimant-Appellant/Appellant Howard M. Pedro, Sr. (Pedro), self-
represented, in response to Reef Development and Travelers's
September 13, 2019 motion, and (3) the record, it appears that
Pedro's July 1, 2019 notice of appeal is untimely as to the 
Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board's  (LIRAB)
February 13, 2019 decision and order in LIRAB Case No. AB 2017-1
1At all relevant times, the Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals
Board appears to have been composed of Chair Danny J. Vasconcellos, Member
Melanie S. Matsui and Member Marie C. Laderta.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
184 (K). Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 386-88 (2015) provides
in part: 
The decision or order of the appellate board shall be final
and conclusive, except as provided in section 386-89, unless
within thirty days after mailing of a certified copy of the
decision or order, the director or any other party appeals
to the intermediate appellate court, subject to chapter 602,
by filing a written notice of appeal with the appellate
board, or by electronically filing a notice of appeal in
accordance with the Hawaii rules of appellate procedure.
Pedro did not file his July 1, 2019 notice of appeal
within thirty days after the February 13, 2019 mailing of a
certified copy of the February 13, 2019 decision and order to
Pedro.  Therefore, Pedro's appeal is untimely.  The failure to
file a timely notice of appeal in a civil matter is a
jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot waive and the
appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise of judicial
discretion.  Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127,
1128 (1986).
 Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Reef Development
and Travelers's motion to dismiss appeal is granted, and CAAP-19-
0000484 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, November 7, 2019.
