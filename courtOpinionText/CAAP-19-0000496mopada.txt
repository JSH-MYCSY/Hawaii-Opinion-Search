IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I  
JZ, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v. 
JZ, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(FC-D NO. 17-1-0213) 
MEMORANDUM OPINION 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Hawai
#i divorce cases involve a maximum of four dis-
crete parts: (1)
 dissolution of the marriage; (2) child custody, 
visitation, and support; (3) spousal support; and (4) division 
and distribution of property and debts. Eaton v. Eaton, 7 Haw. 
App. 111, 118, 748 P.2d 801, 805 (1987). The only part not at 
issue in this appeal is the dissolution of the parties' marriage. 
BACKGROUND 
Defendant-Appellant JZ (Mother) and Plaintiff-Appellee 
JZ (Father) were married and have three minor children 
(collectively, the Children). Father filed for divorce. After a 
trial, the Family Court of the First Circuit1 entered a "Decree 
Granting Absolute Divorce and Awarding Child Custody" (Decree) 
and a Judgment.  Mother appealed. Mother raises four points of 
error, contending that the family court: 
1. abused its discretion in awarding sole
physical custody of the Children to Father; 
2. erred in calculating Mother's and Father's
income, and in calculating Mother's child support
obligation; 
1 The Honorable Jessi L.K. Hall presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
3. erred in dividing and distributing Mother's
and Father's property; and 
4. erred by reducing Mother's child support
obligation in lieu of awarding her spousal
support. 
In response, Father (through counsel) filed a notice that he 
"will not be filing an answering Brief [sic] in this matter, and relies on the Trial Court's Order, Findings of Facts, and Conclusions of Law." 
For the reasons explained below, we affirm the 
Judgment, vacate the Decree in part, vacate the family court's findings of fact and conclusions of law that are inconsistent with this opinion, and remand this case to the family court for further proceedings. 
PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
Mother and Father were married on March 16, 2008. The 
Children were born in 2011 and 2012. Father filed for divorce on February 23, 2017. Extensive litigation followed, including multiple motions for pre-decree relief, numerous discovery disputes, three restraining orders, and a disputed post-nuptial agreement. The family court appointed Nicole K. Cummings (Best-
Interest Fact Finder) to be the children's best-interest fact 
finder pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 571-46 
("Criteria and procedure in awarding custody and visitation; best 
interest of the child") and 571-46.4 ("Child custody evaluators"). The Best-Interest Fact Finder was directed to submit a report to the family court on certain issues, with recommendations. Her 144-page report was filed (under seal)
2 on 
June 4, 2018. 
2 HRS § 571-84(a) (2016) provides, in relevant part: 
[I]n proceedings under section 571-11 [to determine the
custody of any child] . . . the following records shall bewithheld from public inspection: the court docket, peti-tions, complaints, motions, and other papers filed in anycase; transcripts of testimony taken by the court; andfindings, judgments, orders, decrees, and other papers otherthan social records filed in proceedings before the court. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The trial took place over 12 days in late 2018 and 
early 2019. The family court heard testimony from Mother, 
Father, the Best-Interest Fact Finder, and seven other witnesses. On May 14, 2019, the family court entered its "Decision and Order re: Trial" (D&O). The Decree and the Judgment were entered on 
June 14, 2019. Mother appealed. The family court's findings of 
fact and conclusions of law (Findings & Conclusions)were entered 
on September 9, 2019.

STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
[T]he family court possesses wide discretion in making its
decisions and those decision[s] will not be set aside unlessthere is a manifest abuse of discretion. Thus, we will notdisturb the family court's decisions on appeal unless thefamily court disregarded rules or principles of law orpractice to the substantial detriment of a party litigantand its decision clearly exceeded the bounds of reason. 
Fisher v. Fisher, 111 Hawai# i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 (2006) 
(citation omitted). 
Mother challenges 114 of the family court's findings of 
fact. Findings of fact are reviewed under the "clearly errone-
ous" standard. Fisher, 111 Hawai# i at 46, 137 P.3d at 360. A 
finding of fact is clearly erroneous when the record lacks sub-stantial evidence to support the finding, or despite substantial evidence in support of the finding, we are nonetheless left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. Id.
"Substantial evidence" is credible evidence which is of suffici-ent quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion. Id. 
The family court made several specific findings 
regarding witness credibility: 
38. The [Best-Interest] Fact Finder's report and
[her] testimony was comprehensive and persuasive to the
Court. 
3 Rule 52(a) of the Hawai #i Family Court Rules provides, in relevant
part: 
[U]pon notice of appeal filed with the court, the courtshall enter its findings of fact and conclusions of lawwhere none have been entered, unless the written decision ofthe court contains findings of fact and conclusions of law. 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
. . . . 
66. The Court finds the testimony of [Mother's
former housemate] to be credible. 
67. The Court did not find [Mother]'s testimony
regarding her limited consumption of prescription drugs and
alcohol, and the fact that she did not mix the twosubstances to be credible. 
. . . . 
202. The Court finds [Mother's business valuation
expert]'s report to not be credible as he was only provideda limited amount of information by [Mother]'s counsel,limiting his ability to perform a complete analysis. 
"It is well-settled that an appellate court will not pass upon 
issues dependent upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight of evidence; this is the province of the trier of fact." Fisher, 
111 Hawai# i at 46, 137 P.3d at 360 (citation omitted). 
Mother also challenges 19 of the family court's 
conclusions of law. Conclusions of law are ordinarily reviewed de novo, under the right/wrong standard, "and are freely reviewable for their correctness." Fisher, 111 Hawai# i at 46, 
137 P.3d at 360. However, if a conclusion of law presents mixed questions of fact and law, we review it under the "clearly erroneous" standard because the conclusion is dependent on the facts and circumstances of the case. Estate of Klink ex rel.

DISCUSSION 
We discuss each of Mother's points of error in the 
order raised in her opening brief. 
I. Child Custody and Visitation 
The family courts are uniquely positioned as triers of 
fact in complicated and emotional child custody cases; appellate courts afford them great deference in making custody decisions and in determining what is in the best interests of the child. DJ v. CJ, No. SCWC-17-0000027, 2020 WL 1879625 (Haw. Apr. 13, 2020) (Nakayama, J., concurring and dissenting) (citing AA v. BB, 139 Hawai# i 102, 106, 384 P.3d 878, 882 (2016)). "The criteria 
and procedures for the family court to award custody and determine the best interests of the child are set forth in 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRS § 571-46." WN v. SM, 143 Hawai# i 128, 135, 424 P.3d 483, 490
(2018) (citation omitted). 
The statute provides, in relevant 
part:  
(a) In actions for divorce . . . where there is at issue a 
dispute as to the custody of a minor child, the court . . .
may make an order for the custody of the minor child as mayseem necessary or proper. In awarding the custody, thecourt shall be guided by the following standards,considerations, and procedures: 
(1) Custody should be awarded to either parent or toboth parents according to the best interests ofthe child, and the court also may considerfrequent, continuing, and meaningful contact ofeach parent with the child unless the courtfinds that a parent is unable to act in the bestinterest of the child; 
. . . . 
(4) Whenever good cause appears therefor, the courtmay require an investigation and report concern
-
ing the care, welfare, and custody of any minorchild of the parties. When so directed by thecourt, investigators or professional personnelattached to or assisting the court, hereinafterreferred to as child custody evaluators, shallmake investigations and reports that shall bemade available to all interested parties andcounsel before hearing, and the reports may bereceived in evidence[;] 
(5) The court may hear the testimony of any personor expert, produced by any party or upon thecourt's own motion, whose skill, insight, knowl-edge, or experience is such that the person's orexpert's testimony is relevant to a just andreasonable determination of what is for the best physical, mental, moral, and spiritual well-being of the child whose custody is at issue[.] 
. . . . 
(b) In determining what constitutes the best
interest of the child under this section, the court shallconsider, but not be limited to, the following: 
. . . . 
(2) Any history of neglect or emotional abuse of achild by a parent; 
(3) The overall quality of the parent-childrelationship; 
(4) The history of caregiving or parenting by eachparent prior and subsequent to a marital orother type of separation; 
(5) Each parent's cooperation in developing andimplementing a plan to meet the child's ongoingneeds, interests, and schedule; provided thatthis factor shall not be considered in any case 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
where the court has determined that family
violence has been committed by a parent; 
(6) The physical health needs of the child; 
(7) The emotional needs of the child; (8) The safety needs of the child; (9) The educational needs of the child; (10) The child's need for relationships with
siblings; 
(11) Each parent's actions demonstrating that theyallow the child to maintain family connectionsthrough family events and activities; providedthat this factor shall not be considered in anycase where the court has determined that familyviolence has been committed by a parent; 
(12) Each parent's actions demonstrating that theyseparate the child's needs from the parent'sneeds; 
(13) Any evidence of past or current drug or alcoholabuse by a parent; 
(14) The mental health of each parent; 
(15) The areas and levels of conflict present withinthe family; and 
(16) A parent's prior wilful misuse of the protectionfrom abuse process under chapter 586 to gain atactical advantage in any proceeding involvingthe custody determination of a minor. Such willful misuse may be considered only if it isestablished by clear and convincing evidence,and if it is further found by clear and con-vincing evidence that in the particular familycircumstances the wilful misuse tends to show that, in the future, the parent who engaged inthe wilful misuse will not be able to cooperatesuccessfully with the other parent in theirshared responsibilities for the child. The court shall articulate findings of fact wheneverrelying upon this factor as part of its determi-nation of the best interest of the child. 
HRS § 571-46 (2018). 
In this case, the family court's D&O states: 
2. Custody. 
. . . . 
b. Physical Custody
. [Father] shall be awarded
sole physical custody of the parties' minor children,subject to [Mother]'s rights of reasonable timesharing asset out below. 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Findings & Conclusions contain 82 findings of fact (not 
including subparts) relating to child custody. The findings make reference to the Best-Interest Fact Finder's report and testimony (which the family court found to be "comprehensive and persuasive"), Mother's response to Father's request for admissions, specific trial exhibits, and testimony from Mother, Father, the Best-Interest Fact Finder, Mother's former housemate (whom the family court found to be credible), and Mother's psychologist.
4 The family court made specific findings 
concerning the factors enumerated in HRS § 571-46(b). The Findings & Conclusions contained the following conclusion of law: 
12. [Father] shall be awarded sole physical custody
of the parties' minor children, subject to [Mother]'s rights
of reasonable timesharing as set out below. 
Based upon our review of the trial record, we hold that the 
family court's findings of fact on the issue of child custody were supported by substantial evidence, and that the family court did not err by awarding sole physical custody of the Children to Father, subject to Mother's visitation rights as set out in the Findings & Conclusions. 
II. Child Support 
The family court must utilize the current Hawai# i Child 
Support Guidelines (Guidelines
) to set or modify child support 
orders unless exceptional circumstances warrant departure. PO v. 
JS, 139 Hawai# i 434, 442, 393 P.3d 986, 994 (2017). The Guide-
lines are promulgated by the Hawai# i family courts.  They contain 
substantive rules and principles for calculating support, and 
4 Mother argues that the family court erred in striking her expert
witnesses, Dr. Marvin W. Acklin (who was to proffer opinion testimony relating
to child custody) and Stephen H. Reese (a lawyer who was to proffer opiniontestimony relating to business interests). Mother mistakenly contends that"there is no law or court order issued in this case that required [Mother] toproduce a report in order for [her expert witnesses] to be permitted totestify at trial." The family court's pretrial order no. 1, entered onJuly 19, 2018, required that experts' reports be exchanged, and set adeadline. Mother concedes that neither Dr. Acklin nor Mr. Reese prepared areport. The family court did not abuse its discretion by granting Father'smotion to strike those witnesses. See Komata v. Komata, No. CAAP-11-0000537,
2012 WL 5359175, at *1-*2 (Haw. App. Oct. 31, 2012) (mem.) (citing Glover v.Grace Pac. Corp., 86 Hawai #i 154, 164, 948 P.2d 575, 585 (App. 1997)
(precluding expert from testifying due to failure to produce timely report,without finding bad faith or prejudice)).

include various appendices; Appendix A includes the "Child 
Support Guidelines Worksheet" (CSG Worksheet), which is used to 
determine the initial calculation of a parent's monthly support 
obligation. Id. at 441-42, 393 P.3d at 993-94. The family court's determination of what is an exceptional circumstance authorizing deviation from the Guidelines is a conclusion of law reviewed de novo under the right/wrong standard of review. Child Support Enf't Agency v. Doe, 104 Hawai# i 449, 455, 91 P.3d 1092, 
1098 (App. 2004). 
Decisions whether to order such deviations are 
discretionary decisions reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard of review. Id. 
A. Father's Fluctuating Income 
Father was self-employed.  For a self-employed parent,
the Guidelines (2014) provide, in relevant part: 5 
III. OTHER CHILD SUPPORT CONSIDERATIONS 
. . . . 
E. SELF-EMPLOYED INDIVIDUALS 
1. SELF-EMPLOYED  individuals with gross
incomes under $13,000 per month may
calculate Monthly Net Income (Line 2)using either the automated version of theCSG WORKSHEET or the manual steps in§III.E.2. below. Self-employed
individuals must report gross income minusordinary, necessary and reasonablebusiness/operating expenses, and mayinclude a reasonable amount for ordinarywear and tear of capital assets(calculated on a straight line basis overthe useful life of the asset), minus one-half of self-employment taxes (refer totax returns) . 
The Court or OCSH may
determine what (if any) depreciation maybe subtracted. 
2. SELF-EMPLOYED INDIVIDUALS WITH INCOME OVER $13,000 PER MONTH  may calculate Monthly
Net Income (Line 2) by using either theautomated version of the CSG WORKSHEET (ongross income up to $999,999.00 per month)or by using the manual steps below. A 
worksheet for Self-Employed IndividualsWith Income Over $13,000 Per Month isattached as Appendix E .

Guidelines at 16-17 (footnotes omitted) (bold italics added). 
Father's proposed CSG Worksheet set his monthly gross
income at $15,000. Mother proposed that Father's monthly gross
income be imputed at $25,000. The record on appeal indicates that the family court relied on Father's income and expense statement filed on November 15, 2018, and Father's tax returns,to find:   
 
97. [Father]'s income fluctuates; as such it is
reasonable to impute his income at $18,000.00 per month. 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
There is no indication in the record that the family court or 
either of the parties used Appendix E to the Guidelines to calculate Father's gross monthly income. The family court made no findings or conclusions as to why it could not do the Appendix E analysis. Thus, it was premature to simply impute income to Father based upon fluctuating amounts of gross income. 
We cannot determine, based on the record, whether or 
not the family court's finding that Father's imputed gross monthly income was $18,000 is supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, we vacate the family court's calculation of Father's imputed gross monthly income and the parties' resultant child support obligations. On remand, the family court should require that the parties each submit an Appendix E analysis with references to supporting evidence for each of the Step One, Step Two, and Step Three calculations. The family court should then, if possible, make its own findings and conclusions as to the proper calculations based on its own Guidelines analysis, weighing any conflicting evidence and making credibility determinations, if necessary. If at that point it is not possible based on the evidence and arguments to determine father's self-employment income, the family court should make appropriate findings as to that impossibility, and then make findings as to the basis for the amount of income imputed to Father. See IS v. PS, CAAP-10-0000082, 2013 WL 4458889, at *7 
(Haw. App. Aug. 21, 2013) (mem.) (when family court imputes income to parent, it must make findings explaining why and how income was imputed). 
B. Mother's Income 
Father's proposed CSG Worksheet set Mother's monthly 
gross income at $6,472. Mother's proposed findings of fact set her monthly income at $3,810, which was the amount of her social security disability benefit. Mother has not challenged the following findings of fact: 
99. [Mother] testified that she currently works
part-time at Allstate Insurance as a Marketing Coordinator. 
10 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
100. [Mother] provided an e-mail dated February 6,
2019 from Rory Lee offering her a position with Allstate
Insurance. (See [Mother]'s Exhibit "JJJJJ".) 
101. [Mother] testified that she is currently in a
part-time position as full time hours are not available toher. 
. . . . 
104. [Mother] testified that she rents out a room in
the upstairs area of her Hawaii Kai residence for $
1,400.00
per month and the downstairs area for $2,000.00 per month. 
105. [Mother] testified, and per her Income and
Expense Statement filed April 1, 2019, that she receives$3,810.00 per month for herself and the children for SocialSecurity Disability. (See [Mother]'s Exhibit "TTTTT".) 
106. [Mother] submitted a letter from August 18, 2015
regarding her employment offer with United Auto Credit.[Mother] was employed while receiving Social SecurityDisability. (See [Mother]'s Exhibit "W".) 
107. [Mother] shall continue to receive the Social
Security Disability payments on behalf of the children andsaid amount shall be included in her income for child support purposes. 
Based upon Mother's part-time (two days per week according to her 
exhibit JJJJJ) income of $1,200 per month, the family court found that Mother would earn $3,000 per month if she worked full-time, and imputed that amount as income to Mother. 
The Hawai# i Supreme Court has instructed: 
in determining gross income for calculation of child
support, the Guidelines permit the family court to useimputed income when a parent is not employed full-time or isemployed below full earning capacity. When the parent is. . . underemployed for reasons other than caring for thechild, the parent's income may be determined and imputed bythe family court according to the parent's income capacityin the local job market and considering both the reasonableneeds of the child(ren) and the reasonable work aspirationsof the parent. 
PO v. JS, 139 Hawai# i at 442 n.16, 393 P.3d at 994 n.16 (cleaned 
up). The following findings of fact, although challenged by 
Mother, are supported by substantial evidence in the record: 
120. [Mother] testified that recently her health has
improved and that she is no longer unable to obtain
employment due to a disability. 
121. [Mother] has academic and professional
credentials to include: Bachelor of Arts, Masters inBusiness Administration, Insurance License, and Real EstateLicense. 
11 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
122. [Mother] testified that she is highly qualified
in the areas of Business Administration and sales. 
The family court also found, and the record bears out, that 
Mother "did not provide testimony or evidence that she is physically or mentally incapable of working full-time." It appears that the family court performed a mathematical calculation of Mother's full-time earning capacity based upon Mother earning $1,200 per month for two days of work per week — or $600 per work day — and multiplied the per-day amount by 5 to calculate imputed full-time income. The family court did not clearly err by calculating imputed full-time income based upon Mother's part-time compensation and qualifications. Adding the uncontested total rental income of $3,400 per month, and her social security disability income of $3,810 per month, the family court found Mother's monthly gross income to be $10,210. The family court's calculation of Mother's income was supported by substantial evidence. The family court did not err in finding that Mother's imputed monthly gross income was $10,210. 
C. Child Support 
Because we are remanding this case for the family court 
to enter specific findings of fact explaining its calculation of Father's gross monthly income or to recalculate the amount of Father's monthly gross income, on remand the family court should also recalculate (if necessary) the parties' child support obligations using Appendix E to the Guidelines and the CSG Worksheet. 
III. Property Division and Distribution 
The family court's final division and distribution of 
property in a divorce is reviewed under the abuse of discretion 
standard, in view of the factors set forth in HRS § 580-47 and the marital partnership model. Selvage v. Moire, 139 Hawai# i 
499, 506-07, 394 P.3d 729, 736-37 (2017). 
HRS § 580-47 (2018) provides, in relevant part: 
(a) Upon granting a divorce . . . the [family] court may
make any further orders as shall appear just and equitable
. . . (3) finally dividing and distributing the estate ofthe parties, real, personal, or mixed, whether community, 
12 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
joint, or separate[.] . . . In making these further orders,
the court shall take into consideration: the respectivemerits of the parties, the relative abilities of theparties, the condition in which each party will be left bythe divorce, the burdens imposed upon either party for thebenefit of the children of the parties, the concealment ofor failure to disclose income or an asset, or violation of arestraining order issued under section 580-10(a) or (b), ifany, by either party, and all other circumstances of thecase. 
Under the marital partnership model: 
Marital partnerships are equal partnerships. During amarriage, both partners enjoy the consequences of onepartner's successes and both partners suffer theconsequences of one partner's failures. . . . Absent alegally permissible and binding partnership agreement to thecontrary [i.e., a valid premarital agreement], partnersshare equally in the profits of their partnership, eventhough they may have contributed unequally to capital orservices. 
Jackson v. Jackson, 84 Hawai# i 319, 333-34, 933 P.2d 1353, 1367-
68 (App. 1997) (cleaned up). The marital partnership model 
recognizes three general classifications of property: 
Premarital Separate Property . This was the property owned
by each spouse immediately prior to their marriage or
cohabitation that was concluded by their marriage. Uponmarriage, this property became either Marital SeparateProperty or Marital Partnership Property. 
Marital Separate Property . This is the following property
owned by one or both of the spouses at the time of the
divorce: 
a. All property that was excluded from the marital
partnership by an agreement in conformity with theHawai #i Uniform Premarital Agreement Act (HUPAA), HRS
chapter 572D (Supp.1992); 
b. All property that was excluded from the marital
partnership by a valid contract; and c. All property that (1) was acquired by the
spouse-owner during the marriage by gift or
inheritance, (2) was expressly classified by thedonee/heir-spouse-owner as [their] separate property,and (3) after acquisition, was maintained by itselfand/or sources other than one or both of the spousesand funded by sources other than marital partnershipincome or property. 
Marital Partnership Property . All property that is not
Marital Separate Property. 
Hamilton v. Hamilton, 138 Hawai# i 185, 200-01, 378 P.3d 901, 916-
17 (2016) (cleaned up). 
13 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
When dividing Marital Partnership Property, the family 
court utilizes five categories of net market value (NMV): 
Category 1 . The NMV, plus or minus, of all property
separately owned by one spouse on the date of marriage ( DOM)
but excluding the NMV attributable to property that is
subsequently legally gifted by the owner to the otherspouse, to both spouses, or to a third party. 
Category 2 . The increase in the NMV of all property whose
NMV on the DOM is included in category 1 and that the owner
separately owns continuously from the DOM to the date of theconclusion of the evidentiary part of the trial ( DOCOEPOT ). 
Category 3 . The date-of-acquisition NMV, plus or minus, of
property separately acquired by gift or inheritance duringthe marriage but excluding the NMV attributable to propertythat is subsequently legally gifted by the owner to theother spouse, to both spouses, or to a third party. 
Category 4 . The increase in the NMV of all property whose
NMV on the date of acquisition during the marriage is
included in category 3 and that the owner separately ownscontinuously from the date of acquisition to the DOCOEPOT. 
Category 5 . The difference between the NMVs, plus or minus,
of all property owned by one or both of the spouses on the
DOCOEPOT minus the NMVs, plus or minus, includable incategories 1, 2, 3, and 4. 
Selvage, 139 Hawai# i at 507, 394 P.3d at 737 (cleaned up). 
Each partner's individual contributions to the marriage,i.e., the values of Category 1 and Category 3, are to berepaid to the contributing spouse absent equitable con-siderations justifying a deviation. 
Absent equitable considerations justifying a different
result, the increase in the value of each partner'sindividual contributions to the marriage, i.e., the valuesof Category 2 and Category 4, are divided equally betweenthe parties. 
The value of Category 5, which is the net profit or loss of
the marital partnership after deducting the other fourcategories, is to be divided equally unless equitableconsiderations merit deviation. 
If there is no agreement between the [partners] defining the

of the facts necessary for categorization of the properties and 
assignment of the relevant NMVs; (2) identify any equitable 
considerations justifying deviation from an equal distribution, 
focusing on the present and the future, not the past; (3) decide 
whether or not there will be a deviation; and (4) decide the 
extent of any deviation. Selvage, 139 Hawai# i at 509-10, 394

A. JZ Insurance Services, LLC 
Mother contends that the family court "erred in 
effectively determining that the parties' insurance business was not a business, and in its valuation and division of that business." Mother's contentions have no merit. 
The family court made the following findings of fact, 
which were supported by substantial evidence: 
131. [Father] has a business known as JZ Insurance
Services, LLC, (hereinafter "JZ Insurance") in which he
services insurance contracts, policies, and accounts. 
. . . . 
134. Pursuant to the 2014 tax returns, JZ Insurance
filed as a sole proprietorship. (See [Father]'s Exhibit"134".) 
. . . . 
136. Per [Father], [Mother] did not actually work for
JZ Insurance. 
. . . . 
140. Through JZ Insurance, [Father] is an independent
contractor with Insurance Associates, Inc. (hereafter "IA"). 
141. Ms. Surita Savio is the owner of IA. 
142. Per Ms. Savio, [Father] does not have an
employment agreement or written contract for work heperforms for IA. 
143. [Father] is an agent that does work through IA,
he is not an agency himself. 
(e) an itemized statement of the actual division by the
court of each of the assets/debts owned/owed at the time of
the divorce; 
(f) an itemized statement of the specifics of each

16 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
144. [Father] "services" accounts. Per Ms. Savio 
"service" means running around talking to people, to include
customers and underwriters. 
145. Ms. Savio did meet with both [Father] and
[Mother] prior to [Father] becoming an agent with IA. 
146. Ms. Savio recalls at the time of the meeting
that [Mother] had a full-time job and that [Father] would bedoing most of the work. 
147. [Father] receives commissions for work performed
based on an oral agreement with IA as to the commissionscale. The commission structure is the same for all accounts, not just "house accounts". 
148. IA provided JZ Insurance with office space,
computers, and office furniture. 
149. [Father] works out of the IA office. He does 
not pay rent to IA, but a portion of his commissions does[sic] go towards his share of the IA overhead. 
150. JZ Insurance has no employees. 
151. [Father] has a "book of business" which lists
all of the accounts that he services. 
152. Approximately ninety percent (90%) of [Father]'s
"book of business" are "house accounts". The other ten percent (10%) are owned by [Father]. 
153. "House accounts" are those accounts that were 
referred to or provided to [Father] through IA or anotheragent with IA. 
154. [Father] services the "house accounts" but does
not own them. 
155. If [Father] were to leave IA to work with
another agency, he would not be permitted to take the "houseaccounts" with him, nor can [Father] transfer thoseacccounts [sic] outside of IA. 
156. Only the customer of those "house accounts" may
decide to leave IA. The agent cannot decide to take theseaccounts when they leave IA. 
. . . . 
163. JZ Insurance owes IA $
507,615.13. Said amount 
is made up of $4,412.68 for a US Bank credit card,$37,140.53 for a AMEX credit card, $135,000.00 in loans toJZ Insurance, and $331,061.92 in uncollected premiums due byclients (ie. [sic] "bad premium debt"). (See [Father]'sExhibit "84".) 
164. Each agent for IA is responsible for their "bad
premium debt" as it is their job to collect the funds. 
165. Outstanding "bad premium debt" owed to IA is
paid through [Father]'s commission income. 
17 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Mother does not dispute that: 
160. [Mother] did work at IA for approximately eight
months about ten to twelve years ago. During that time
[Mother] had a full-time job and shortly thereafter shestopped working to be a stay at home mother. 
The property division chart attached to the family 
court's Findings & Conclusions (PDC)  showed the value of JZ 
Insurance Services, LLC at the DOCOEPOT to be $0.00. The family 
court's finding of zero value was based upon the opinion testimony of Father's valuation expert Gary Kuba. The family court made the following findings of fact, all of which were supported by substantial evidence: 8
172. Gary Kuba, CPA, ABV, ASA was stipulated as an
expert regarding business valuations. 
173. Per Mr. Kuba's Fair Market Valuation for JZ 
Insurance dated September 25, 2018, using the asset approach
the fair market value was zero. 
174. Mr. Kuba testified that in actuality it has a
negative value due to the debt owed by JZ Insurance to IA.(See [Father]'s Exhibit "80".) 
. . . . 
176. Per Mr. Kuba JZ Insurance is a company, but not
a business as it has no characteristics of a stand-alone business. 
All other agents of IA receive their commission
checks in their individual names. 
177. Ms. Savio also provided a letter dated July 18,
2018, which stated that there was no broker agreement withJZ Insurance and that any transfer of accounts would requireclearing all past account balances, loans and approval ofIA. (See [Father]'s Exhibit "85".) 
178. Mr. Kuba testified that as a business valuator 
he is mandated to consider all three valuation approaches. 
179. Per Mr. Kuba, using the market approach to value
JZ Insurance is inappropriate because you would have to usethe agency multiplier and JZ Insurance is not an agency.This method would leave the value of JZ Insurance as zero. 
180. Per Mr. Kuba, the use of the income approach
would require having an employee to generate commissions.That person would then need to be paid. Between payroll andoverhead all of the cash flow would be consumed. This would leave the value of JZ as zero. 
8 The family court appears to have adopted Father's proposed
property division chart without any changes. It does not appear that Motheroffered a proposed property division chart to the family court, either as atrial exhibit or in her proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. 
18 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
181. In determining the value, Mr. Kuba did consider
the approximate ten percent (10%) of JZ Insurance accounts
that do not belong to IA. He included the commissions from these accounts, but with all of the debt on JZ Insurance,the business would still be running at a negative. 
182. Mr. Kuba does believe that Antolick [sic] does
apply to this case as [Father]'s sole efforts in servicingthe accounts is what created the cash flow. 
(Underscore in original.) The family court rejected the 
valuation opinions of Mother's expert, Eddy Nelson Kemp, because: 
186. Mr. Kemp based his report on a schedule created
by [Mother]'s counsel that only included gross profit and no
expenses. (See [Mother]'s Exhibit "L".) 
187. Mr. Kemp did not talk to [Father] or [Mother] as
part of his evaluation and only spoke to Ms. Savio regardinglimited generalities of her business, but not specificallyabout his valuation or JZ Insurance. 
188. Mr. Kemp was further provided a summary prepared
by [Mother]'s attorney of the testimony of Ms. Savio andMr. Kuba. 
189. Mr. Kemp did not receive the same documents
provided to Mr. Kuba. (See [Father]'s Exhibit "83".) 
190. Mr. Kemp did receive the parties' tax returns,
but did not consider them. 
191. Mr. Kemp based his valuation on the market
approach, with the assumption that the policies are allowned by JZ Insurance and that they could be sold to anoutside source. 
192. Mr. Kemp did not use the asset based approach as
he did not have the appropriate information. 
193. Mr. Kemp did not believe that Mr. Kuba's report
considered the possibility that there could be a willingbuyer. But, if there was no willing buyer the value of the
business would be zero. 
194. Mr. Kemp testified that he did understand that
JZ Insurance was an agent under the IA umbrella and that hereceived no evidence that JZ Insurance has worked with anyother agency. 
195. Mr. Kemp testified that his evaluation was based
on three assumptions: (1) there are no contracts between JZInsurance and IA, (2) all client accounts belong to JZInsurance, and (3) IA would not allow a $400,000.00 debt tobe incurred by JZ Insurance. 
196. Mr. Kemp does not believe that Antolik is
binding on this case as he believes that the accounts can betransferred. 
(Bold italics added.) 
19 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Antolik v. Harvey, 7 Haw. App. 313, 761 P.2d 305 
(1988), referred to by both Kuba and Kemp, was a divorce case in 
which we stated: 
When dividing and distributing the value of the
property of the parties in a divorce case, the relevant
value is, as a general rule, the fair market value (FMV) ofthe parties' interest therein on the relevant date. We define the FMV as being the amount at which an item wouldchange hands from a willing seller to a willing buyer,neither being under any compulsion to buy or sell and bothhaving reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts. 
. . . . 
. . . Whatever approach or combination of approaches
is used to support an amount, it must always be rememberedthat (1) in divorce cases the sole object of the exercise isto determine the FMV of the business on the relevant date and (2) absent special circumstances, the value of a soleproprietorship professional business does not include, andmust be separated from, the value attributable to the soleprofessional who operates it. 
Id. at 318-19, 761 P.2d at 309. In Antolik the husband was a 
chiropractor; at issue was the valuation of his business, KalaheoChiropractic. The husband's expert witness first calculated an adjusted net book value of Kalaheo Chiropractic's business's assets (which would include physical assets such as furniture, fixtures, and equipment), then valued the patient charts as if the husband had died, for a total value of about $48,000. We held:  
As an operating business, Kalaheo Chiropractic has no
more than two types of willing buyers: investors and
licensed chiropractors. The investor is primarily concernedwith the certainty of Kalaheo Chiropractic's future netincome which depends substantially on Husband's continuedpresence and production or on the in-fact transfer of theexisting patient base to a replacement chiropractor who isno less productive than Husband. The chiropractor isprimarily concerned with the in-fact transfer of KalaheoChiropractic's existing patient base from Husband to [them].If Husband can quit, if Husband can stay but decrease hisproduction, or if the existing patient base of KalaheoChiropractic will not transfer to the replacement chiro-practor, then the investor's and the chiropractor's primaryconcerns will not have been satisfied and both will be unwilling to pay anything for goodwill. 
Kalaheo Chiropractic cannot require its existing
patient base to transfer to a chiropractor who replacesHusband. Moreover, Kalaheo Chiropractic cannot preventHusband from quitting, from decreasing his production, orfrom opening a nearby competing business and encouraging itsexisting patient base to follow him. In other words,Kalaheo Chiropractic has no enforceable legal right toHusband's continued services or to his agreement not to 
20 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
compete if he decides to leave it. If Kalaheo Chiropractic
does not own the enforceable legal right to Husband'scontinued services and to prevent Husband from quitting andcompeting with it, then the valuation of Kalaheo Chiroprac-tic's goodwill, if any, cannot be based on the assumptionthat Kalaheo Chiropractic can legally force Husband tocontinue his services to it and prevent Husband fromquitting and competing with it. 
Id. at 320, 761 P.2d at 310. 
This case presents an analogous situation because JZ 
Insurance operates out of IA and owns no physical assets. Its 
value consists solely of the cash flow that could be generated by Father earning commissions through IA (subject to Father's debt to IA). Mother has not challenged the following conclusions of law by the family court: 
40. For business valuations, fair market value is
the amount at which a willing seller would sell to a willing
buyer when both have reasonable knowledge of relevant factsand neither is under a compulsion to buy or sell. Antolik 
v. Harvey, 7 Haw. App. 313, 319, 761 P.2d 305, 309 (1988). 
41. In determining whether the goodwill of a
business constitutes marital property, a distinction must bemade between (1) true goodwill (also known as enterprisegoodwill) which is a marketable business asset, and (2) thegoodwill which is dependent on the continued presence of theprofessional involved. The former constitutes marital property, while the latter does not. Id. at 318. 
42. The value of any goodwill separate and apart
from the efforts of [Father] himself is zero. 
Mother contends that the following conclusions of law are 
erroneous: 
43. [Father] owns 100% of JZ Insurance Services,
LLC. 
44. The value of [Father]'s business known as JZ
Insurance Services, LLC is determined to be zero dollars and
said business shall be awarded to [Father], subject to anydebt thereon. 
Conclusions of law nos. 43 and 44 are mixed findings of fact and 
conclusions of law. We hold that the family court's findings of fact were supported by substantial evidence and were not clearly 
21 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
erroneous, and that the family court did not err in concluding 
that the value of JZ Insurance at the DOCOEPOT was zero.9 
B. New Communications 
Mother contends that the family court "erred in 
including New Communications in the Property Division Chart." The PDC showed the value of New Communications at the DOCOEPOT to be $0.00. A note to the PDC stated that "New Communications was listed on [Father]'s Asset and Debt Statement, but no testimony was provided regarding said business." The family court concluded: 
45. No evidence was presented as to [Mother]'s
business known as New Communications; it is awarded to
[Mother], subject to any debt thereon. 
46. [Father] shall be awarded the business known as
JZ Insurance, LLC and [Mother] shall be awarded the businessknown as New Communications. Each party shall also beawarded any assets associated with the respective businessesthey are awarded as well as be solely responsible for anydebts associated with the respective business they areawarded.[
10] 
Mother had previously stated that her "former business, New 
Communications, LLC is no longer in business and does not exist as of December 2009." That being the case, the family court did not err in finding the value of New Communications to be zero and awarding it to Mother. 
C. The Kailua Property 
Mother owned three pieces of real property immediately 
prior to the marriage: (1) in Kailua, Hawai# i (Kailua Property); 
(2) in Sacramento, California (Sacramento Property); and (3) in 
Marysville, California (Marysville Property).  Mother does not 
contest that upon marriage, this property became Marital 
9 Based upon Kuba's opinions, the family court could have found that
JZ Insurance had a negative value, but Father has not made that argument and
is bound by the valuation of zero. The family court did not apportion any ofJZ Insurance's debt to Mother. See Findings & Conclusions, conclusion of law
no. 46 (quoted below). 
10 Father did not attempt to have Mother assume any of the
$507,615.13 debt owed to IA by Father/JZ Insurance. See Findings &
Conclusions, finding of fact no. 163. 
22 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Partnership Property.   Mother contends that "the Kailua 
[P]roperty was not equally divided but should have been." Mother 
does not challenge the following findings of fact: 11
218. [Mother] purchased the [Kailua P]roperty . . .
for $1,250,000.00 [before the marriage]. 
219. . . . [T]he value of the [Kailua P]roperty . . .
on March 15 [sic], 2008[12] was $1,180,000.00. (See
[Father]'s Exhibit "92".) . . . [R]eal estate prices across
the island of Oahu dropped during this time period. 
. . . . 
223. The outstanding mortgage balances on the [Kailua
P]roperty on the date of marriage were $996,000 and$244,000. (See [Father]'s Exhibit "61".) 
. . . . 
226. The appraised value of the [Sacramento P]roperty
. . . as of March 16, 2008[,] was $
315,000.00. (See
[Father]'s Exhibit "94".) 
227. The date of marriage mortgage values for the
[Sacramento P]roperty was [sic] $258,991.00 and $91,009.00.(See [Father]'s Exhibit "61"). 
. . . . 
229. The appraised value of the [Marysville P]roperty
. . . as of March 16, 2008[,] was $
194,000.00. (See
[Father]'s Exhibit "96".) 
230. The date of marriage mortgages for the
[Marysville P]roperty were in the amounts of $54,000.00 and$221,000.00. (See [Father]'s Exhibit "61"). 
The PDC accurately shows that the net value of Mother's 
Premarital Separate Property on the date of marriage was <$176,000.00>. Mother's premarital debt is the root of her discontent. 
The family court found, and Mother does not contest, 
that the Sacramento Property and the Marysville Property had both been sold. The family court awarded the net proceeds from those sales, totaling $90,925.94, to Mother. Finding of fact no. 235 states, and Mother does not contest, that the Kailua Property was 
11 Neither party submitted evidence of Father's ownership of
Premarital Separate Property. 
12 This appears to have been a typographical error. The date of 
marriage was March 16, 2008. Father's trial exhibit 92 indicates that the 
valuation date was actually March 16, 2008, not March 15, 2008. 
23 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
sold for $1,320,000 during the pendency of the divorce trial. 
Mother challenges the following conclusion of law: 
35. Real Property. 
. . . . 
b. At the time of trial the Kailua [P]roperty had
been listed for sale, but had yet to close. 
The proceeds
shall be used to first pay all closing costs, the first
mortgage, and HELOC [home equity line of credit] on saidproperty. [Mother] shall then receive $40,000.00 from thenet proceed and [Father] shall be awarded the remainingbalance of the net proceeds. 
The family court did not make a finding of fact concerning the 
balance of the first mortgage or the HELOC, but the PDC indicates that the mortgage balance was $911,967.72 and the HELOC balance was $123,386.00. Thus, Mother received $130,925.94 from the sales of the three properties, while Father received $244,646.28 — a difference of $113,720.34. 
Mother contends that the family court failed to conduct 
the four-part analysis required by Gordon, 135 Hawai# i at 351, 
350 P.3d at 1019, before departing from the equal distribution model. 
Mother would be correct if the distribution of the 
parties' real property is viewed in isolation. But Part A of the PDC lists all
 Marital Partnership Property, and divides the 
assets and debts. Mother and Father each had substantial post-marital debt. The NMV of Marital Partnership Property on the DOCOEPOT was $86,006.16. The net value of Mother's Premarital Separate Property on the date of marriage — i.e., Mother's capital contribution — was <$176,000.00>. After accounting for Mother's premarital debt, under the equal distribution model Mother owed Father a $72,137.12 equalization payment. If Mother had been awarded nothing from the sale of the Kailua Property, Mother would still have owed an equalization payment of $32,137.12. We hold that the family court did not err by awarding Mother $40,000 more than what she would have been entitled to under the equal distribution model. 
24 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
D. Equalization 
The D&O stated: 
8. Property Division. The assets and debts are 
hereby divided as set out in the Property Division Chart
("PDC") attached hereto as Exhibit "B". The Court finds valid and relevant circumstances for an equitable deviationfrom the partnership principles in this matter. As such,[Mother] will not be required to pay the equalizationpayment as set out in the PDC. 
The Decree stated: 
11. Property Division. The assets and debts are
hereby divided as set out in the Property Division Chart("PDC") attached hereto as Exhibit "2". The Court finds valid and relevant circumstances for an equitable deviationfrom the partnership princples [sic] in this matter. As such, [Mother] shall not be required to pay the equalizationpayment as set out in the PDC. 
(Bold omitted.) 
Mother contends that she should not have been subject 
to an equalization payment because the family court erred in 
calculating the value of JZ Insurance. As explained above, the family court did not err in finding that the value of JZ Insurance was zero. Even if the family court erred by not conducting the four-part analysis required by Gordon, 135 Hawai# i 
at 351, 350 P.3d at 1019, there was no prejudice to Mother because Mother would have owed Father $32,137.12 under the partnership distribution model. 
We need not address Mother's 
appeal on the deviation issue. See Wong v. Wong, 87 Hawai# i 475, 
484, 960 P.2d 145, 154 (App. 1998) (where family court deviated from partnership model division in favor of appellant, and appellee did not challenge family court's authority to deviate, deviation was not an issue in the appeal). 
E. Attorney's Fees 
Mother contends that the family court erred in awarding 
attorney's fees to Father. HRS § 580-47(f) provides: 
Attorney's fees and costs. The court hearing any motion for
orders either revising an order for the custody, support,maintenance, and education of the children of the parties,or an order for the support and maintenance of one party bythe other, or a motion for an order to enforce any suchorder or any order made under subsection (a) of thissection, may make such orders requiring either party to payor contribute to the payment of the attorney's fees, costs, 
25 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and expenses of the other party relating to such motion and
hearing as shall appear just and equitable afterconsideration of the respective merits of the parties, therelative abilities of the parties, the economic condition ofeach party at the time of the hearing, the burdens imposedupon either party for the benefit of the children of theparties, the concealment of or failure to disclose income oran asset, or violation of a restraining order issued undersection 580-10(a) or (b), if any, by either party, and all 
other circumstances of the case . 
(Bold italics added.) "[A]n award of attorney's fees is in the 
sound discretion of the [family] court, limited only by the standard that it be fair and reasonable." Hamilton, 138 Hawai# i 
at 209, 378 P.3d at 925 (citing cases). 
The D&O states, in relevant part: 
10. Attorney Fees. [Father] shall be awarded the
amount of $2,919.00 for defending against [Mother]'s Motion
to Enforce Postnuptial Agreement filed July 19, 2018, theamount of $523.50 for having to file [Father]'s Motion toCompel filed September 13, 2018, and the amount of $1,062.00for having to file [Father]'s Second Motion to Compel filedOctober 30, 2018. As such [Mother] shall owe to [Father]the total amount of $4,504.50. Said amount shall be paidwithin 120 days of the filing of this Decision and Order. 
The Decree states, in relevant part: 
24. Attorney's Fees: [Father] shall be awarded the
amount of $2,919.00 for defending against [Mother]'s Motionto Enforce Postnuptial Agreement filed July 19, 2018, theamount of $523.50 for having to file [Father]'s Motion toCompel filed Sept4ember [sic] 13, 2018, and the amount of$1,062.00 for having to file [Father]'s Second Motion toCompel filed October 30, 2018. As such, [Mother] shall oweto [Father] the total amount of $4,504.50. Said amount shall be paid to [Father] by September 11, 2019 (i.e., 120days from the Decision and Order filed on May 14, 2019). 
The Findings & Conclusions state, in relevant part: 
255. [Father]'s request for attorney's fees for
having to defend against the Motion to Enforce Post-Nuptialagreement was reserved for the trial judge per the Order[on] Oral Motion to Withdraw Motion to Enforce Post-NuptialAgreement Dated March 23, 2018[,] and Financial RestrainingOrder filed August 20, 2018. 
256. [Mother] admitted that she did not produce the
original post-nuptial agreement to [Father] as theyrequested. 
257. Upon reviewing old check registers, [Mother]
began doubting the authenticity of the signatures on thepost-nuptial agreement. 
258. [Mother] testified that she hired a handwriting
expert after she filed her Motion to Enforce Post-Nuptial

1. Mother's motion to enforce postnuptial agreement. 
On July 19, 2018, Mother filed a motion to enforce what 
she claimed was the parties' "Postnuptial Agreement," dated 
March 23, 2008 (the date of the marriage was March 16, 2008). The motion included Mother's affidavit authenticating the alleged postnuptial agreement — purportedly signed by both parties — and stating, "We agreed to enter into a postnuptial agreement because I had significantly more assets than [Father]." 
Father filed a memorandum in opposition on August 9, 
2018, stating "he is certain that the signature[s] on the allegedpostnuptial agreement . . . and the financials attached to it arenot his." Father denied entering into the agreement and pointed out contradictory statements made by Mother in a previous declaration, Mother's failure to respond to Father's requests to   
27 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
see the original postnuptial agreement, and Mother's eventual 
concession that she did not have possession of the original. Father stated there was 
some amount of discussion about a postnuptial agreement, but
that he refused to enter into it because [Mother] did nothave significantly more assets. They were paying expensesjointly, the [Sacramento and Marysville] properties hadsignificant negative equity and were on interest only loans. 
. . . [H]e refused into [sic] a marital agreement
under these circumstances because he was being expected tocontribute his earnings to all of these properties, some inthe negative and with an uncertain future. 
The motion was heard on August 15, 2018.  Mother's 
counsel stated: 13
[M]y client would respectfully request to withdraw hermotion to enforce without prejudice. Without rehashingeverything that was discussed in pretrial, Your Honor, thebasis of my client's request to withdraw is based in largepart that since the filing of her motion, she has discoveredthat the original that she -- the original that she locatedis -- is really not the accurate original. Based on her own due diligence that she -- that she performed, not only doesit appear that [Father]'s signature is a fake, but it alsoappears that her signature as well is not her signature. 
After hearing argument from Father's counsel (which included an 
oral request for fees and costs), the family court addressed Mother's counsel: 
Let me say this though. It's not only [Father's counsel]
who's troubled, but I'm also troubled by the fact that adocument was put forward that allegedly formed the basis ofthe motion that's before me that's now being withdrawn, thatdid bear signatures which turned out to -- at this pointit's acknowledged that apparently it's not the signature of[Father]. And it may not even be the signature of yourclient. So am I troubled by that? Yes, I am. Is [Father'scounsel] right to be troubled by that? I think he is rightto be troubled by that. 
So -- so I'm allowing -- I'm going to allow you to
withdraw your motion. 
This is what I'm going to do, [Father's counsel]. I'm 
going to reserve on the issues of both attorney's fees andthe handwriting [expert's] fees. The handwriting [expert],if he was -- he or she were [sic] hired after the filing ofthis motion in preparation for hearing, file a motion onthat, and I may be inclined to grant those fee -- the feesfor the handwriting [expert]. Okay? 
13 The Honorable Kevin A. Souza presided. 
28  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
With respect to the attorney's fees, I'm just going to
reserve that until you can renew that at the time of final
property division. Okay? But I'll allow you to preservethat claim. Okay? I think that's the correct balance to strike given the totality of the circumstances here becauseI too am troubled about the fact that a motion was putforward based on a document that clearly has two signatureson it which may or may not turn out to be both forged. So you know, that's -- that's concerning to me. 
The family court ultimately granted Father's request for 
attorney's fees relating to Mother's motion to enforce the postnuptial agreement.
14 Based on the record, we hold that the 
family court did not abuse its discretion in so doing. See 
Hamilton, 138 Hawai# i at 210, 378 P.3d at 926 (holding that award 
of attorney's fees to Wife was fair and reasonable where Wife's trial expenses were increased by Husband's filing of various pretrial motions). 
2. Father's motions to compel. 
On September 13, 2018, Father filed a motion to compel 
Mother to produce various documents requested in discovery relating to at least four trusts in which Mother had a potential interest, with "assets . . . in the millions of dollars." On October 30, 2018, Father filed a second motion, to compel Mother to produce various financial records that had been requested in discovery. Mother's counsel filed responsive declarations on November 7, 2018, and November 14, 2018. The motions were heard on November 14, 2018.
15 The family court ruled that any exhibit 
offered at trial that was the subject of a legitimate discovery request but not produced will not be allowed into evidence, and that "Any attorney's fees regarding lapses in discovery are reserved for the trial court." The family court ultimately granted Father's requests for attorney's fees in connection with his motions to compel discovery, as it was authorized to do under Rule 37(a)(4) of the Hawai# i Family Court Rules.
16 Mother's 
opening brief makes no discernible argument that the family court 
14 The Honorable Jessi L.K. Hall signed the order. 
15 The Honorable John C. Bryant, Jr. presided. 
16 The Honorable Jessi L.K. Hall signed the order. Mother has not 
challenged the amounts of the fee awards. 
29 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
abused its discretion in awarding Father the attorney's fees he 
incurred in connection with his motions to compel discovery. Thus, we decline to address her contention. See Kakinami v. Kakinami, 127 Hawai# i 126, 144 n.16, 276 P.3d 695, 713 n.16 
(2012) (citing In re Guardianship of Carlsmith, 113 Hawai
#i 236, 
246, 151 P.3d 717, 727 (2007) (noting that appellate court may "disregard a particular contention if the appellant makes no discernible argument in support of that position") (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)). 
IV. Spousal Support 
HRS § 580–47(a) requires the family court to consider
the following criteria when making further orders for the
support and maintenance of either spouse: "the respectivemerits of the parties, the relative abilities of theparties, the condition in which each party will be left bythe divorce, the burdens imposed upon either party for thebenefit of the children of the parties, . . . and all othercircumstances of the case." The family court must alsoconsider all of the following factors in ordering spousalsupport and maintenance: 
(1) Financial resources of the parties; 
(2) Ability of the party seeking support and
maintenance to meet [their] needs independently; 
(3) Duration of the marriage; 
(4) Standard of living established during the
marriage; (5) Age of the parties; 
(6) Physical and emotional condition of the parties; (7) Usual occupation of the parties during the
marriage; 
(8) Vocational skills and employability of the party
seeking support and maintenance; (9) Needs of the parties; 
(10) Custodial and child support responsibilities; 
(11) Ability of the party from whom support and
maintenance is sought to meet [their] own needs while
meeting the needs of the party seeking support andmaintenance; 
(12) Other factors which measure the financial 
condition in which the parties will be left as the
result of the action under which the determination of maintenance is made; and 
(13) Probable duration of the need of the party
seeking support and maintenance. 
30 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 Hamilton, 138 Hawai# i at 209, 378 P.3d at 925 (citations
omitted). When deciding the issue of spousal support:  
The first relevant circumstance is the payee's need. What 
amount of money does [the payee] need to maintain thestandard of living established during the marriage? 
The second relevant circumstance is the payee's ability to
meet [their] need without spousal support. Taking intoaccount the payee's income, or what it should be, includingthe net income producing capability of [their] property,what is [their] reasonable ability to meet [their] needwithout spousal support? 
The third relevant circumstance is the payor's need. What 
amount of money does [the payor] need to maintain thestandard of living established during the marriage? 
The fourth relevant circumstance is the payor's ability to
pay spousal support. Taking into account the payor'sincome, or what it should be, including the income producingcapability of [their] property, what is [their] reasonableability to meet [their] need and to pay spousal support? 
When answering any of the above questions, the following two
rules apply: Any part of the payor's current inability topay that was unreasonably caused by the payor may not beconsidered and must be ignored. Any part of the payee'scurrent need that was caused by the payee's violation of[their] duty to exert reasonable efforts to attain self-sufficiency at the standard of living established during themarriage may not be considered and must be ignored. 
Wong, 87 Hawai# i at 485, 960 P.2d at 155 (cleaned up). 
In this case Mother requested spousal support, but the 
family court reduced Mother's child support obligation in lieu of 
awarding her spousal support. The family court found and concluded: 
115. [Father] testified that the marital debt needs
to be paid before alimony is paid. 
116. In 2011, [Mother] was diagnosed with fibromy-
algia, which led to depression and anxiety. Despite this,
she continued to work until 2014. 
117. [Mother] testified that in 2014 she was able to
control her illness to the point she was functional. 
118. [Mother]'s Social Security Disability Insurance
application dated December 9, 2014 listed her limitations,to include but not limited to, not being able to walk, toonly be able to sit for 30 minutes at a time, only able tostand up for 10 minutes at a time, and unable to care forherself without assistance. (See [Father]'s Exhibit "65".) 
119. [Mother] signed the 2015 Federal tax return
stating that she was disabled. (See [Father]'s Exhibit"135".) 
31 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
120. [Mother] testified that recently her health has
improved and that she is no longer unable to obtain
employment due to a disability. 
121. [Mother] has academic and professional
credentials to include: Bachelor of Arts, Masters inBusiness Administration, Insurance License, and Real EstateLicense. 
122. [Mother] testified that she is highly qualified
in the areas of Business Administration and sales. 
123. [Mother] obtained employment on or about
February 7, 2019[,] at Allstate Insurance as a MarketingCoordinator (See [Mother]'s Exhibit "JJJJJ".) 
124. Prior to Allstate Insurance, [Mother] was last
employed at United Auto Credit until January 2016. 
125. [Mother] testified that she is starting a
non-profit organization. 
126. [Mother]'s counsel stated on December 3, 2018,
at the beginning of trial that [Mother]'s position hadchanged and her request was for [Father] to pay her alimonyof $2,000-$2,500 per month for nine months and then$1,000-$1,500 per month for six months. 
127. [Mother] requested on direct examination that
[Father] pay alimony of $10,838.62 per month. No duration was provided. 
128. In closing argument [Mother]'s counsel requested
$11,000 per month in alimony. No duration was provided. 
129. [Mother] did not provide the Court with back up
documents for the expenses listed on her Income and ExpenseStatement filed April 1, 2019. 
130. [Mother] did not testify as to a plan to obtain
self-sufficiency. 
. . . . 
29. In lieu of alimony, [Mother]'s child support
obligation shall be reduced. 
30. It is reasonable for [Mother] to receive
financial assistance by way of a reduction of child supportfor a period of one year. 
The Decree stated, in relevant part: 
5. Child Support. 
. . . . 
b) [Mother]'s Obligation
. 
(1) From 6/1/2019 through
5/31/2020. The Court imputes [Father]'s income for childsupport purposes to be $18,000.00 per month, and [Mother]'sincome for child support purposes to be $10,210.00 per month([Mother] shall continue to collect the Social SecurityDisability payments for the minor children as said amount isincluded in her income[)]. 
32 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Pursuant to the attached Child Support Guidelines
Worksheet (see Exhibit "1"), [Mother] would pay to [Father]
as and for the support, maintenance, and education of theparties' three (3) minor children, the amount of$1,004.33[ ]per child per month, for a total of THREETHOUSAND THIRTEEN AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($3,013.00) per month. 
However, based on [Mother]'s request for alimony, the
Court finds an exceptional circumstance to reduce childsupport to $500.00 per child per month, for a total of$1,500.00 per month. Said sum of $1,500.00 shall be paid intwo (2) equal installments of $750.00 each, on the 1st and15th days of each month, commencing on June 1, 2019 andshall continue at that rate until June 1, 2020. 
. . . . 
(2) From 6/1/2020 and Thereafter
. 
Commencing on June 1, 2020, [Mother]'s child supportobligation shall increase to the sum of $1,004.33 per childper month, for a total of $3,013.00 per month. Said sum of $3,013.00 shall be paid in two (2) equal installments of$1,506.50 each, on the 1st and 15th days of each month,commencing on June 1, 2020. 
. . . . 
8. Alimony
. [Mother]'s request for alimony
is denied, subject to the provisions of paragraph 3 [sic]hereinabove, entitled, "Child Support". 
The family court did not first calculate the amount of 
spousal support to which Mother would otherwise be entitled under 
HRS § 580–47(a), utilizing the factors and principles set forth in Wong, 87 Hawai# i at 485, 960 P.2d at 155, and Saromines v. 
Saromines, 3 Haw. App. 20, 27, 641 P.2d 1342, 1348 (1982). 
It 
appears that the family court considered Mother's ability to support herself, lack of a plan to obtain self-sufficiency, and failure to demonstrate her standard of living during the marriage.  However, there are no findings relating to Mother's 
ability to meet her needs without spousal support, or to Father's need or his ability to pay spousal support. 
17
In addition, because we are vacating the family court's 
income and child support calculations, on remand the family court should also consider whether changes in its child support calculations, if any, impact its decision regarding spousal support. 
17 According to finding of fact no. 129, "[Mother] did not provide
the Court with back up documents for the expenses listed on her Income and
Expense Statement filed April 1, 2019." We question whether Mother providedthe family court with evidence sufficient to determine her standard of livingduring the marriage. HRS § 580–47(a)(4); Wong, 87 Hawai #i at 485, 960 P.2d at
155. 
33 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 CONCLUSION 
Based upon the foregoing, we: (1) affirm the family 
court's award of sole physical custody of the Children to Father, 
subject to Mother's visitation rights set forth in the Findings & Conclusions; (2) affirm the family court's calculation of 
Mother's imputed monthly gross income, vacate the family court's 
calculations of Father's imputed gross monthly income and the parties' resultant child support obligations, and remand for the family court to enter specific findings of fact explaining its calculation of Father's imputed gross monthly income or to recalculate (if necessary) the amount of Father's monthly gross income (using Appendix E to the Guidelines) and the parties' child support obligations (using the CSG Worksheet); (3) affirm 
the family court's valuations of JZ Insurance and New 
Communications, division of property, elimination of Mother's equalization payment, and award of attorney's fees incurred by Father in connection with Mother's motion to enforce the alleged postnuptial agreement and Father's motions to compel discovery; and (4) vacate the family court's reduction of Mother's child 
support obligation in lieu of awarding her spousal support, and remand for the family court to make findings regarding Mother's need and her ability to meet her need without spousal support, and Father's need and his ability to pay spousal support. Because we are vacating the family court's child support calculations, on remand the family court should also consider whether changes in its child support calculations, if any, impact its decision regarding spousal support.
