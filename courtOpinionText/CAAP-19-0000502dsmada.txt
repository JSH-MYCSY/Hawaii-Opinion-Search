NO. CAAP-19-0000502
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
REMAX PROPERTIES, authorized agent for RICHARD K. TAHARA
and MARJORIE T. TAHARA, owners of the subject property,
Plaintiff-Appellee, v. CHRISTOPHER YOUNG, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
PUNA DIVISION
(CIVIL NO. 3RC-18-1-1186)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.)
Upon review of the record, it appears that:
(1) On July 8, 2019, self-represented Defendant-
Appellant Christopher Young (Young) conventionally filed the
notice of appeal.  The district court clerk electronically filed
the notice of appeal on July 10, 2019;
(2) On September 5, 2019, the district court clerk
filed the record on appeal;
(3) On September 6, 2019, the appellate clerk notified
the parties that the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief
were due on or before September 16, 2019, and October 15, 2019,
respectively;
(4) Young did not file either document or request an
extension of time;
(5) On September 18, 2019, Young filed a civil appeals
docketing statement, where he stated that due to hisNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
circumstances, filing an opening brief was impossible and the
court should decide the appeal based upon "the evidence of the
record and videos of the hearings;"
(6) On October 23, 2019, the appellate clerk notified
Young that the time for filing the statement of jurisdiction and
opening brief had expired, the matter would be called to the
court's attention on November 4, 2019, for appropriate action,
which could include dismissal of the appeal, under Hawai#i Rules
of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rules 12.1(e) and 30, and Young may
request relief from default by motion;
(7) On November 4, 2019, Young filed an "objection" to
the default notice where, among other things, he makes various
assertions but does not indicate that he intends to file an
opening brief;
(8) Young took no further action in this appeal; and
(9) Without an opening brief, Young has failed to
present discernable and understandable points of error for the
court to review, and the court is not required to proceed with
this appeal.  Young's failure to file the statement of
jurisdiction and opening brief violate HRAP Rules 12.1(e) and 30,
respectively, and dismissal is warranted.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is
dismissed.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai#i, February 28, 2020.
