(CIVIL NO. 5CC191000044) NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
MEMORANDUM OPINION 
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka and McCullen, JJ.) 
In CAAP-19-0000505, Shannon Buckner, Wayne J. Rapozo, 
Merwin Andrew Stapp, Jr. and Sharon Margaret Stapp (together, the
Stapps), Jennie Guerrero , Terri Ferreira-Ige , and Eugene 
Evans, Jr., Mathew Evans, and Shamus Evans (the Evanses) appeal 
from the Final Judgment entered by the Circuit Court of the Fifth 
Circuit on July 5, 2019, in 5CC161000209 (the Partition Action ).1 
In CAAP-19-0000576, Buckner and Rapozo appeal from the 
Final Judgment entered by the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit on July 22, 2019, in 5CC191000044 (the Rapozo/Buckner Action ).
2 
For the reasons discussed below, we (1) affirm the 
Final Judgment in the Partition Action as to Buckner, Guerrero, Ferreira-Ige, the Evanses, and the Stapps; (2) vacate in part the Final Judgment in the Partition Action to the extent it vests sole ownership of the land at issue in Carlos Lawrence Andrade
3 
and adjudges the value of Rapozo's interest in the Parcels, and remand for further proceedings; (3) direct the circuit court to vacate in part its July 13, 2023 order (the Escheat Order ) in the 
Partition Action to the extent it applies to proceeds from the partition sale due to the Stapps or Rapozo; and (4) affirm the Final Judgment in the Rapozo/Buckner Action. 
BACKGROUND 
Andrade owned an undivided interest in four Parcels of 
kuleana land on Kaua #i.
4 On December 30, 2016, he filed the 
Partition Action against 308 named defendants, each of whom also 
1 The Honorable Kathleen N.A. Watanabe presided. 
2 The Honorable Randal G.B. Valenciano presided. 
3 Andrade died during the pendency of these appeals. Ivy H.
Andrade, personal representative of Andrade's estate, was substituted for
Andrade in both appeals. 
4 "Kuleana land" means "land granted to native tenants pursuant to
L 1850, p. 202 . . . as originally enacted and as amended." Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 669-2 (2016). 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
owned undivided interests in the Parcels.5 Rapozo wasn't one of 
them, because he didn't acquire his interest in the Parcels until 
after Andrade filed the complaint. Rapozo moved to intervene after acquiring his interest in the Parcels from the Stapps. The circuit court denied intervention. 
Andrade moved for summary judgment to quiet title to, 
and partition, the Parcels. The circuit court granted the motion, apportioned the parties' fractional interests in the Parcels, ordered a partition by sale, and appointed aCommissioner  to sell the Parcels by public auction. The 
Commissioner conducted the auction on March 22, 2019. He filed a report on April 2, 2019. Andrade moved to confirm the sale. The circuit court reopened bidding, confirmed sale of the Parcels to Andrade for $2.145 million, apportioned the net sale proceeds among the defendants, and entered a judgment on July 5, 2019. Buckner and Rapozo appealed; the Stapps, Guerrero, Ferreira-Ige, and the Evanses cross-appealed. 
Meanwhile, Rapozo and Buckner filed the Rapozo/Buckner 
Action against Andrade on March 20, 2019 (two days before the public auction of the Parcels). The complaint alleged four counts: (1) an accounting of, and a constructive trust on, rents received from the Parcels; (2) damages for abuse of process; (3) a declaration that the judgment in the Partition Action was void; and (4) a declaration that Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) 
Chapter 668 (Partition of Real Estate) was unconstitutional as applied to the Partition Action. Andrade moved to dismiss. The circuit court granted the motion and entered a judgment on July 22, 2019. Buckner and Rapozo appealed. 
On August 31, 2020, while these appeals were pending, 
the Commissioner filed a report in the Partition Action. The report stated (among other things) that Buckner, Guerrero, Ferreira-Ige, and the Evanses had cashed checks for their shares 
5 Northshore Kalo LLC, originally a plaintiff, was realigned as the
309th defendant. The complaint also named 200 unknown defendants, some of
whom were later identified, who are not parties to these appeals. 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of the partition sale proceeds. The report didn't state when the 
checks had been cashed. Three years later, on July 13, 2023, the circuit court entered the Escheat Order. It ordered that the Commissioner deposit all undistributed proceeds with the court, and that funds remaining unclaimed after one year would escheat under HRS Chapter 523A. Included in the list of unclaimed funds were checks to "Wayne Rapozo c/o Sharon Margaret Stapp" and to Merwin Stapp. 
On October 20, 2023, we ordered supplemental briefs on 
the legal effect Buckner, Guerrero, Ferreira-Ige, and the Evanses cashing their checks had on their appeals. After the supplemental briefs were filed, we remanded the Partition Action to the circuit court for fact-finding. Cf. Wilmington Sav. Fund 
Soc'y, FSB v. Domingo , Nos. SCWC-18-0000099 and SCWC-18-0000712, 
2023 WL 2017392, at *4 n.12 (Haw. Feb. 15, 2023) (mem. op.) (stating "the ICA should have temporarily remanded the case to the circuit court" for fact-finding to determine whether appeal was moot). 
On January 17, 2024, the Commissioner reported to the 
circuit court that "Wayne J. Rapozo has not cashed his check . . . sent care of Sharon Buckner [sic] per the instruction of his attorney." The circuit court entered findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an order on February 7, 2024. It found that (a) Buckner cashed the check for her portion of the sale proceeds on October 16, 2019, and a check covering a state tax lien on September 30, 2019; (b) Guerrero cashed her check on October 11, 2019; (c) Ferreira-Ige cashed her check on October 8, 2019; (d) the Evanses cashed their checks on September 16 and October 16, 2019; (e) the Commissioner's August 31, 2020 report was the first documentation of his distribution of checks to the parties; and (f) Andrade did not know that Buckner, Guerrero, Ferreira-Ige, or the Evanses had cashed their checks before he filed his answering brief on April 6, 2020. 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
DISCUSSION 
(1) Buckner, Guerrero, Ferreira-Ige, and the Evanses 
are estopped from challenging the Final Judgment in the Partition 
Action because they acquiesced in the judgment by cashing the Commissioner's checks for their respective portions of the partition sale proceeds. 
Hawai#i recognizes the theory of quasi-estoppel, which is a
species of equitable estoppel which has its basis in
election, waiver, acquiescence, or even acceptance ofbenefits and which precludes a party from asserting toanother's disadvantage, a right inconsistent with a positionpreviously taken by the party. 
Furthermore, unlike
equitable estoppel, an estoppel by acquiescence does notrequire a showing of detrimental reliance or prejudice. 
Estoppel by acquiescence does, however, require that
the party being charged with estoppel have knowledge ofrelevant facts. . . . Before one may be charged withknowledge it must appear that he possesses full knowledge ofall the material particulars and circumstances and was fullyapprised of the effect of the acts ratified and of his legalrights in the matter. 
Harrison v. Casa De Emdeko, Inc., 142 Hawai#i 218, 232, 418 P.3d 
559, 573 (2018) (cleaned up).
 The Commissioner reported that Rapozo "has not cashed 
his check . . . per the instruction of his attorney." 
Rapozo's 
attorney also represents Buckner, Guerrero, Ferreira-Ige, and the 
Evanses. This shows that Buckner, Guerrero, Ferreira-Ige, and the Evanses had "full knowledge of all the material particulars and circumstances and [were] fully apprised of the effect of the acts ratified and of [their] legal rights in the matter" when they cashed their checks. Harrison, 142 
Hawai#i at 232, 418 P.3d 
at 573. There was no urgency for them to do so; the Escheat Order was issued three years later. We conclude that by cashing their checks, they acquiesced in the judgment. Andrade cannot be said to have waived this argument, because he did not know Buckner, Guerrero, Ferreira-Ige, and the Evanses had cashed their checks when he filed his answering brief. 
Moreover, other exceptions warranting reversal of the 
Partition Action do not apply. 
This is not a foreclosure case in 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
which the mortgagee's purchase of the foreclosed property "does 
not free himself from the underlying dispute to which he is a party[.]" City Bank v. Saje Ventures II , 7 Haw. App. 130, 133, 
748 P.2d 812, 814 (1988) (cleaned up). Andrade owned an interest in the Parcels. He paid $2.145 million for sole ownership of the Parcels in the partition sale. More than $2 million has been disbursed; only $131,337.26 remains unclaimed. Under these circumstances, it would be inequitable to allow Buckner, Guerrero, Ferreira-Ige, and the Evanses to undo the sale. They are estopped by acquiescence from challenging the judgment in the Partition Action. 
We must still address the merits of the Stapps' and 
Rapozo's appeals from the Partition Action, and Rapozo and Buckner's appeal from the Rapozo/Buckner Action.
(2) The Stapps argue that the circuit court erred by 
declining to set aside their defaults. Rapozo argues that the circuit court erred by denying his motion to intervene. These issues are related because the Stapps conveyed their interests in the Parcels to Rapozo before their defaults were entered. 
Andrade filed the Partition Action on December 30, 
2016. He filed a notice of pendency of action ( NOPA) on 
January 4, 2017. The NOPA was recorded in the Bureau of Conveyances on January 6, 2017. Sharon was served on February 26, 2018. Merwin was served on February 27, 2018. Merwin conveyed his interest in the Parcels to Rapozo on March 13, 2018. Sharon conveyed her interest to Rapozo on March 19, 2018. Rapozo's deed from Merwin was recorded on March 23, 2018. His deed from Sharon was recorded on April 4, 2018. 
The Stapps' defaults were entered on May 7, 2018, after 
they had conveyed their interests to Rapozo, and after both deeds had been recorded. On June 20, 2018, Rapozo moved to intervene. Attached to his motion were copies of Merwin's and Sharon's quitclaim deeds. Andrade opposed the motion. The circuit court denied Rapozo's motion by order entered on August 22, 2018. On 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
September 10, 2018, the Stapps moved to set aside their defaults. 
The court denied the Stapps' motion to set aside on October 18, 2018. At this point, the 2/1638 interest (according to the Final Judgment) in the Parcels the Stapps conveyed to Rapozo was unrepresented in the proceedings.
(a) We review denial of a motion to set aside entry of 
default for abuse of discretion. Chen v. Mah
, 146 Hawai #i 157, 
171, 457 P.3d 796, 810 (2020). The Stapps had to show they had a 
meritorious defense (among other things). 
BDM, Inc. v. Sageco, 
Inc., 57 Haw. 73, 77, 549 P.2d 1147, 1150 (1976), abrogated by Chen v. Mah, 146 Hawai #i 157, 457 P.3d 796 (2020).  They had no 
interest in the Parcels when they were defaulted, having conveyed their interests to Rapozo. They had no standing under HRS § 668-1 (2016) (Partition) or HRS § 669-1 (2016) (Quieting Title) to participate in the Partition Action, and no meritorious defense to quieting title or to partition. The circuit court did not abuse its discretion by denying the Stapps' motion to set aside their defaults. 6
(b) Hawai#i Rules of Civil Procedure ( HRCP ) 
Rule 24(a)(2) governs intervention by right "when the applicant claims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action[.]" We review the denial of intervention by right under the right/wrong standard. Hoopai v. Civ. Serv. Comm'n, 106 Hawai #i 205, 216, 103 P.3d 365, 376 
(2004). We consider (1) if the motion was timely; (2) if Rapozo claimed an interest relating to the Parcels; (3) if the disposition of the action would impair or impede Rapozo's ability to protect his interest; and (4) if Rapozo's interest was inadequately represented by the existing defendants. Id.  
Rapozo's motion was timely, having been filed three 
months after he acquired the Stapps' interests in the Parcels. 
6 Chen's "new rule" prospectively applies "only to decisions on
motions to set aside entry of default . . . after the date [January 30, 2020]
of this opinion." 
146 Hawai#i at 177, 457 P.3d at 816. The Stapps' defaults
are still analyzed under 
BDM's three part test. 57 Haw. at 77, 549 P.2d at
1150. 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Rapozo had an interest in the Parcels. The disposition of the 
Partition Action could have impaired that interest. The circuit court concluded that "Rapozo failed to establish that the representation of his interest in the subject parcels is inadequate[.]" But "the requirement of inadequacy of representation is satisfied if the applicant shows that representation of its interests 'may be'  inadequate and . . . the 
burden of making this showing is minimal." 106 
Hawai#i at 217, 
103 P.3d at 377 (citation omitted). When Rapozo moved to intervene, no party in the Partition Action represented the interests in the Parcels the Stapps conveyed to Rapozo. And Rapozo's motion to intervene was consistent with the partition statute. 
See HRS § 668-2 (2016) ("[P]laintiff shall join as a 
party every person having or claiming to have, as far as known to the plaintiff, any legal or equitable right, title, or interest in the property described in the complaint[.]"). 
Andrade's 
opposition to Rapozo's motion to intervene was inconsistent with the statute. 
Andrade argues, without citing Hawai #i authority, that 
"[t]he law is well settled that a purchaser pendente lite is not entitled to intervene or otherwise be made a party to the ongoing lawsuit." But in In re Ward , 31 Haw. 781 (Haw. Terr. 1931), 
Victoria Ward conveyed land to her three daughters after the City filed an eminent domain action to condemn parts of the land. The supreme court noted that the Ward daughters had "actual notice of the pendency of the condemnation suit" but "[n]o appearance was entered . . . by any of the three daughters and no attempt was made by them to defend in their own names." Id. at 783. This 
indicates that the Ward daughters could have intervened, even 
though they "purchased during the pendency of the action" with actual notice that the action was pending. Id. at 783, 785. So too should Rapozo have been allowed to intervene as of right to protect his interest in the Parcels. 
Andrade also argues (and Rapozo does not dispute) that 
Rapozo violated HRCP Rule 24(c). The rule required that Rapozo's 
10 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
motion "be accompanied by a pleading setting forth the claim or 
defense for which intervention is sought." But, as we said in another case: 
the motion to intervene clearly stated the reason why the
intervention was sought. Under the circumstances, weconsider the failure to comply with HFCR Rule 24(c) "aprocedural blunder of no real significance." 
Labayog v. Labayog , 83 Hawai#i 412, 419, 927 P.2d 420, 427 (App. 
1996) (citing 7C Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay 
Kane, 
Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 2d  § 1914 (1986)). 
The circuit court erred by denying Rapozo's motion to intervene. The consequence of Rapozo not becoming a party to the Partition Action is discussed in the next sections. 
(3) Rapozo challenges the order granting summary 
judgment against other defendants when he was not a party to the case. To have standing to appeal, a person must: (1) have been a party to the action; (2) have had standing to oppose the order or judgment in the trial court; and (3) be aggrieved by the ruling — that is, be affected or prejudiced by the appealable order or judgment. Abaya v. Mantell
, 112 Hawai#i 176, 181, 145 P.3d 719, 
724 (2006). "[N]onparties, who did not or could not intervene, are ordinarily denied standing to appeal." 
Id. (italics and 
citation omitted). 
Rapozo was denied intervention in the 
Partition Action and thus lacks standing to appeal from the order granting Andrade's motion for summary judgment. 
Significantly, Rapozo is not aggrieved by the judgment 
in the Partition Action because he was not a party to the case. See Waimea Falls Park, Inc. v. Brown , 6 Haw. App. 83, 87-89, 712 
P.2d 1136, 1139-41 (1985). In that case, Waimea Falls Park sued Brown to quiet title to or partition a lot in Waimea Valley. The trial court entered a judgment declaring that Waimea Falls Park was the sole owner of the lot. Waimea Falls Park's claim of title was based on a commissioner's deed from Antone and Lucy Joseph, husband and wife, to Waimea Falls Park's predecessor in interest, in a partition action. Antone had been a party to the

partition action but Lucy was not, even though her interest 
appeared on record in the Bureau of Conveyances. We stated: "We are aware of no rule of law by which one can be deprived of his title in land by a judgment rendered in a cause to which he was not a party." Id. at 88, 712 P.2d at 1140 (cleaned up). We held 
that Lucy's interest in the lot was not extinguished by the partition action. Although we affirmed the judgment that Brown had no title to the lot, we vacated the judgment that Waimea Falls Park was the sole owner of the lot and remanded "with instructions to afford Waimea the opportunity to join Lucy's estate or her heirs in this matter and proceed with a quiet title action, if it desires to do so." Id. at 101, 712 P.2d at 1148. 
Similarly, in this case we vacate in part the judgment 
in the Partition Action to the extent it purports to vest sole ownership of the Parcels in Andrade and, as discussed in the next section, to the extent it decides the value of Rapozo's interest in the Parcels. We remand the Partition Action to let Rapozo intervene and assert his interest in the Parcels. We express no opinion about how Rapozo should be allowed to prosecute his claims, or about the value of his interest in the Parcels. The Final Judgment in the Partition Action is affirmed in all other respects. 
We also direct the circuit court to vacate in part its 
July 13, 2023 Escheat Order to the extent it applies to proceeds from the partition sale due to the Stapps or Rapozo, so those proceeds do not escheat on July 13, 2024.
(4) Rapozo and Buckner contend that the circuit court 
erred by granting Andrade's motion to dismiss the Rapozo/Buckner Action. We review de novo. We assume the facts alleged in the complaint are true and view them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff to determine if they warrant relief under any legal theory. Bank of Am., N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo

-
57, 428 P.3d 761, 768-69 (2018). 
Rapozo and Buckner's amended complaint was filed on 
March 21, 2019. It alleged: Rapozo and Buckner owned interests 
12 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
in the Parcels; from the 1970s to about 2016 Andrade "occupied 
and/or controlled a substantial part" of the Parcels; Andrade had been collecting rent and other income generated from the Parcels, including one with a cabin, without disclosing the income to others owning interests in the Parcels; Andrade made willful misrepresentations to the court in the Partition Action that were not proper in the regular conduct of the proceeding; and Andrade colluded with others to improperly quiet title to the Parcels and obtain a partition by sale in the Partition Action. Rapozo and Buckner sought (1) an accounting of, and constructive trust on, income received by Andrade from the Parcels; (2) damages for abuse of process; (3) a declaration that the judgment in the Partition Action was void; and (4) a declaration that HRS Chapter 668 was unconstitutional as applied in the Partition Action. 
(a) Andrade moved to dismiss the amended complaint or 
to consolidate the case with the Partition Action.
7 The circuit 
court's order stated the motion was granted because "the claims [in the amended complaint] are duplicative of the [Partition Action]." Rapozo and Buckner argue that none of their claims were actually litigated in the Partition Action, and were discovered after the court had entered summary judgment for Andrade. But no judgment had been entered in the Partition Action when Rapozo and Buckner filed the Rapozo/Buckner Action, and the public auction of the Parcels had not yet taken place. To the extent Buckner (who was party to the Partition Action) discovered facts that might support reconsideration or amendment of the summary judgment order, her remedy was to move for relief from that order under HRCP Rule 60(b). Rapozo (who was not a party to the Partition Action) lacked standing to challenge or 
7 The motion included four exhibits: an unpublished Hawai#i Supreme
Court decision, a document filed in the Partition Action, the Partition Action
docket sheet, and the amended complaint. These documents did not convert the motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment. 
See
 Guity v. State , 153
Hawai#i 368, 372, 538 P.3d 780, 784 (App. 2023) ("A trial court may judicially
notice the contents of court records without converting a motion to dismissinto a motion for summary judgment."). 
13 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
impeach the summary judgment order or judgment. Thus, the 
circuit court did not err by dismissing counts 3 and 4, which sought declarations that the judgment in the Partition Action was void and that HRS Chapter 668 was unconstitutional as applied in the Partition Action.

(b) Andrade argues that the claims for an accounting 
and constructive trust were properly dismissed because, absent ouster, a cotenant may keep profits of their own activity on a parcel. He cites Hawaiian Com. & Sugar Co. v. Waikapu Sugar Co. , 
9 Haw. 75 (Haw. Rep. 1893), and Nahaolelua v. Kaaahu , 10 Haw. 662 
(Haw. Rep. 1897). In reply, Rapozo and Buckner cite Peterson v. Kaanaana , 10 Haw. 384 (Haw. Rep. 1896), and Waiwaiole v. Kulaea , 
22 Haw. 651 (Haw. Terr. 1915). 
In Hawaiian Commmercial & Sugar , the parties owned 
undivided interests in land on Maui. HC&S fenced part of it, dug a ditch to bring in water, and grew sugar cane. Waikapu Sugar asked for an accounting of HC&S's profits as part of the partition of the land. The supreme court held: "to charge a tenant in common with what profits he may make while in possession of the common estate or a part thereof an ouster of his co-tenant . . . must be shown." Id. at 83. Because no 
ouster was shown, the supreme court affirmed the partition without an accounting. However, the supreme court noted it was not "a case where one tenant has rented out the land to third parties taking all the rents to his own use[,]" id.  at 80, and 
"it would be inequitable to compel a co-tenant in possession to account for the profits realized out of his skill, labor and business enterprise when he has no right to call upon his co-tenant to contribute anything towards the production of these profits," id.  at 82 (citation omitted). 
In Nahaolelua , the defendants improved jointly owned 
land, adding a road, ditch, buildings, and fences. The supreme court held the defendants ousted the plaintiffs and, in 
8 The constitutionality issue was argued in the Partition Action,
but the circuit court apparently did not decide it. 
14 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
apportioning the proceeds of the partition sale, offset the 
plaintiffs' claim for the defendants' use and occupation of the land against the defendants' claim for the value of the improvements they made. 10 Haw. at 666. 
In Peterson  the supreme court held that ouster need not 
be shown to obtain an accounting of rents collected by a cotenant from third parties in a partition action. 10 Haw. at 386. The supreme court noted that in Hawaiian Commmercial & Sugar  it had 
been "careful to distinguish a claim on a co-tenant for rents from third parties from one for profits from actual use by the co-tenant." Id. And in Waiwaiole  the supreme court held that in 
a partition action, "[a] cotenant may be required to account for rents collected by him from third parties for the use of the common land." 22 Haw. at 654. 
These cases all stand for the proposition that the 
claims for an accounting and constructive trust should have been litigated in the Partition Action as compulsory counterclaims. "Under Hawai #i law, a counterclaim is compulsory if there is a 
logical relation between the original claim and the counterclaim — i.e., it arises out of the same aggregate of operative facts as the original claim." 
E. Sav. Bank, FSB v. Esteban, 129 Hawai #i 
154, 161 n.13, 296 P.3d 1062, 1069 n.13 (2013) (citing HRCP Rule 13(a)). Buckner is estopped by acquiescence from challenging the judgment in the Partition Action. We are remanding the Partition Action for Rapozo to intervene and assert his interest in the Parcels. The circuit court did not err by dismissing the claims for an accounting and constructive trust in the Rapozo/Buckner Action. 
(c) The elements of a claim for abuse of process are: 
(1) an ulterior purpose; and (2) a willful act in using the process which is not proper in the regular conduct of the proceeding. Young v. Allstate Ins. Co., 119 
Hawai#i 403, 412, 
198 P.3d 666, 675 (2008). "Process" encompasses "the entire range of 'procedures' incident to litigation." Id. (italics, footnote, and citation omitted). 
15 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The plaintiff in Young  was injured in a car accident. 
She filed a tort lawsuit. The defendant was insured by Allstate. 
He admitted falling asleep while driving. Young had incurred over $6,000 in medical expenses and was still receiving medical treatment. Allstate refused to offer more than $5,300 to settle. A jury awarded Young $198,971.71 in damages. Young then sued Allstate for abuse of process (among other things). She alleged that Allstate's "scorched-earth litigation tactics" were part of a formal program intended to increase annual profits by over $200 million by underpaying claims and denying claimants just and reasonable compensation. 119 Hawai #i at 414, 198 P.3d at 677. 
Its defense strategy, she alleged, was intended to punish her for filing her tort lawsuit and "'send a message' to claimants and the plaintiffs' bar nationwide." Id. The circuit court granted 
Allstate's motion to dismiss. Young appealed. 
The supreme court held that Allstate's alleged 
litigation objective was "patently illegitimate" and Young's complaint alleged that Allstate employed process for an ulterior purpose. Young
, 119 Hawai#i at 414, 198 P.3d at 677. However, 
the court stated that Allstate's alleged willful acts — making unreasonably low settlement offers and using scorched-earth litigation tactics — were part of the litigation process. The court noted: 
The most recent edition of Professor Prosser's treatise on 
torts teaches that "[s]ome definite act or threat  not 
authorized by the process, or aimed at an objective notlegitimate in the use of the process, is required ; and there
is no liability where the defendant has done nothing morethan carry out the process to its authorized conclusion,even though with bad intentions ." 
Id. (quoting W. Page Keeton et al, Prosser and Keeton on Torts 
§ 121, at 898 (5th ed. 1984)). The supreme court held that "more is required than the issuance of the process itself." Id. at 
415, 198 P.3d at 678 (citations omitted). The court declined to follow case law from other jurisdictions holding that using process itself is the requisite willful act, and held: "in order to establish an abuse of process claim, the plaintiff must prove 
16  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
a 'willful act' distinct from the use of process per se ." Id. 
at 416, 198 P.3d at 679 (emphasis added). The supreme court 
affirmed the dismissal of Young's abuse-of-process claim. Id. 
We applied Young  in Isobe v. Sakatani , 127 Hawai #i 368, 
279 P.3d 33 (App. 2012). 
The plaintiffs in Isobe  alleged that 
the defendant attorney committed abuse of process by filing and litigating mechanic's lien and foreclosure actions against them, and by filing lis pendens in each action against their property. We held: 
Applying Young  to the instant case, we conclude that
the allegations in the First Amended Complaint fail to
assert a willful act distinct from the use of process.Instead, the allegations contend in numerous and varied waysthat [the defendant attorney] lacked justification for hisuse of process in the Mechanic's Lien Action and theForeclosure Action. Given the holding in Young , such lack-
of-justification allegations do not suffice to support anabuse of process claim. 
Id. at 386, 279 P.3d at 51. 
We recently applied Young  in Domingo v. James B. Nutter 
& Co.
, 153 Hawai#i 584, 543 P.3d 1 (App. 2023). The plaintiffs 
in that case argued that the defendant attorneys committed abuse 
of process by filing a foreclosure complaint knowing their client had no right to foreclose. We held that the plaintiffs alleged an ulterior purpose, but "did not allege the type of improper act upon which a claim of abuse of process may be founded." 
Id. at 
620, 543 P.3d at 37. 
We affirmed the dismissal of the claim for 
abuse of process. 
Rapozo has no claim for abuse of process because he was 
never a party to the action in which he claims process was abused. Regardless, he and Buckner argue these paragraphs of their complaint support their claim for abuse of process: 
113. ANDRADE had an ulterior purpose in telling the Court
that the Defendants in [the Partition Action] all
shared an identical interest, when he knew thatDefendant North Shore Kalo had a very differentinterest, namely ensuring as Mr. Zuckerberg stated,that ANDRADE "will continue his quiet title action andupon completion his family  will have ownership of
those kuleana." (emphasis added). 
17 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
. . . . 
115. ANDRADE's misrepresentation to the Court  was a willful 
act in the use of the process and was not proper in
the regular conduct of the proceeding. 
(Emphasis added.) These paragraphs do not allege willful acts 
distinct from the litigation of the Partition Action. And even if North Shore Kalo's interests were aligned with those of Andrade, at least some of the other defendants — Guerrero, Ferreira-Ige, and the Evanses, according to their appeals — shared interests with Buckner, as shown by their joint appeal from the Partition Action. 
28. On information and belief, ANDRADE has rented out one
or more of the kuleana parcels for long periods of
time, at the expense of the extended Rapozo family andessentially ANDRADE's other co-tenants in common(including members of the extended Rapozo family untilsuch time as they transferred their interest to NorthShore Kalo and/or Andrade). 
. . . . 
30. On information and belief, Defendant ANDRADE has alsoreceived legal services that were paid for by NorthShore Kalo LLC or other Zuckerberg entities, and thevalue of said legal services are part of incomeassociated with the kuleana lands that should be 
disclosed to and shared with the Rapozo family andANDRADE's other co-tenants (including for members ofthe extended Rapozo family for such time as they heldsuch fractional co tenant [sic] interests until theyvoluntarily transferred them. 
. . . . 
32. ANDRADE failed to disclose and share the rental income and other income or value he derived from the four (4)kuleana parcels to the extended Rapozo family or to
his other co-tenants. 
These paragraphs, alleged to support the claim for an accounting 
and constructive trust, do not allege an ulterior purpose for Andrade litigating the Partition Action. Nor do they allege willful acts distinct from the litigation of the Partition Action because (as discussed above) Buckner could have obtained relief by requiring that Andrade account for the rental or other income in the Partition Action. 
18 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
49. Upon information and belief, ANDRADE obtained
ownership of over 10% of the kuleana parcels through
misrepresentation, fraud and/or duress. 
This paragraph does not allege an ulterior purpose by Andrade 
against Buckner because it does not allege that Andrade obtained Buckner's  interest in the Parcels through misrepresentation, 
fraud, or duress. Buckner still owned her interest in the Parcels when she filed the complaint in the Rapozo/Buckner Action two days before the public auction. 
The circuit court did not err by dismissing the abuse 
of process claim. 
CONCLUSION 
For the reasons discussed above, we (1) affirm the 
Final Judgment in the Partition Action as to Buckner, Guerrero, Ferreira-Ige, the Evanses, and the Stapps; (2) vacate in part the Final Judgment in the Partition Action to the extent it vests sole ownership of the Parcels in Andrade and adjudges the value of Rapozo's interest in the Parcels, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this memorandum opinion; (3) direct the circuit court to vacate in part its July 13, 2023 Escheat Order in the Partition Action to the extent it applies to proceeds from the partition sale due to the Stapps or Rapozo; and (4) affirm the Final Judgment in the Rapozo/Buckner Action.
