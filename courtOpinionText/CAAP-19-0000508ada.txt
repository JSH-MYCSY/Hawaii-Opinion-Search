APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 2CPC-18-0000796) 
August 24, 2020 
LEONARD, PRESIDING JUDGE, CHAN and HIRAOKA, JJ. 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY CHAN, J. 
Defendant-Appellant Brian D. Adcock (Adcock) appeals 
from the May 31, 2019 Judgment; Conviction and Sentence; Notice 
of Entry (Judgment) entered by the Circuit Court of the Second 
Circuit (Circuit Court).1  We hold that the Circuit Court did not 
err in determining that Adcock validly waived his right to testify and that any error by the Circuit Court in failing to 
obtain a verbal confirmation of Adcock's understanding of his

right not to testify was harmless.  We further hold that the 
Crime Victim Compensation (CVC) fee and Internet Crimes Against 
Children (ICAC) fee do not amount to unconstitutional taxes and 
the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the 
fees against Adcock.  However, we conclude that the Circuit Court 
erred in failing to instruct the jury on merger.  For that 
reason, we vacate the Judgment and remand for further proceedings 
consistent with this opinion. 
I.  BACKGROUND 
On October 15, 2018, Adcock was charged with two counts 
of Terroristic Threatening in the First Degree, in violation of 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 707-716(1)(e) (2014).2  In both 
counts, it was alleged that on October 10, 2018, Adcock threatened Bert Kamaka (Kamaka) and/or Billy Tagay (Tagay) with a 
knife.  Count 1 further alleged that Adcock acted with the intent 
to terrorize, or in reckless disregard of the risk of terrorizing 
Kamaka.  Count 2 alleged that Adcock acted with the intent to 
terrorize, or in reckless disregard of the risk of terrorizing 
Tagay. 
During the jury trial, Kamaka testified that on the 
morning of October 10, 2018, he arrived at Kalama Park with his 
janitorial crew, which included Tagay, to clean the restrooms. 
Kamaka and Tagay testified that they noticed Adcock pacing back 
and forth about twenty feet from their location, making 
stabbing-type motions with a kitchen knife.  Kamaka testified 
that Adcock then approached them and said "I'm going to stab you 
mother fuckers," while continuing to make the stabbing-type 
motions with the knife. 
2 HRS ยง 707-716(1)(e) provides: "A person commits the offense of
terroristic threatening in the first degree if the person commits terroristic
threatening . . . [w]ith the use of a dangerous instrument or a simulatedfirearm." Terroristic threatening in the first degree is a class C felony. 
HRS ยง 707-715 (2014) provides: "A person commits the offense of
terroristic threatening if the person threatens, by word or conduct, to causebodily injury to another person . . . [w]ith the intent to terrorize, or inreckless disregard of the risk of terrorizing, another person[.]" 
2          FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On February 7, 2019, after the State rested its case, 
the Circuit Court initiated the following Tachibana  colloquy 
with Adcock: 3
THE COURT: Okay. 
So as I discussed with you at the beginning of the
trial, Mr. Adcock, you have a constitutional right to
testify in your own defense.  Although you should consultwith your lawyers regarding the decision to testify, it isyour decision, and no one can prevent you from testifyingshould you choose to do so. 
If you decide to testify, the prosecution will be
allowed to cross-examine you.  That means ask questions of you.  You also have a constitutional right not to testifyand to remain silent.  If you choose not to testify, thejury will be instructed that it cannot hold your silenceagainst you in deciding your case. 
It is the understanding of the Court that you intend
to testify tomorrow.  Is that correct? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma'am. 
THE COURT: Okay.  Is anyone forcing you or making you 
do this? 
THE DEFENDANT: No. THE COURT: Anyone putting any pressure on you? THE DEFENDANT: No. THE COURT: Are you doing this voluntarily of your own
free will? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes. THE COURT: And have you spoken to your attorneys and
discussed this matter with them regarding your decision to
testify? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes. 
THE COURT: Okay.  Regardless of their advice and
having discussed the matter with them, is it still your
decision to testify in this case? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes. 
THE COURT: Okay.  And you've had a chance to consult
with your lawyers about this decision.  Is that right? 
THE DEFENDANT: I did. 
3 Tachibana v. State , 79 Hawai #i 226, 900 P.2d 1293 (1995). 
3 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
THE COURT: Okay.  So the Court finds the defendant 
intends to testify tomorrow. 
The next morning, on February 8, 2019, Adcock's counsel 
informed the Circuit Court that Adcock would no longer be 
testifying and wanted the Circuit Court to re-Tachibana him.  The 
Circuit Court engaged Adcock in the following colloquy: 
THE COURT: So, Mr. Adcock, as I discussed with you
yesterday and at the beginning of the trial, you have a
constitutional right to testify in your own defense.Although you should consult with your lawyers regarding thedecision to testify, it is your decision and no one canprevent you from testifying should you choose to do so. 
If you decide to testify, the prosecutor will be
allowed to cross-examine you, in other words, ask youquestions.  Do you understand? 
THE DEFENDANT: I do. 
THE COURT: Okay.  You also have a constitutional right
not to testify and to remain silent.  If you choose not to
testify, the jury will be instructed that it cannot holdyour silence against you in deciding the case. 
It is the understanding of myself, the Court, that you
do not intend to testify.  Is that correct? 
THE DEFENDANT: That is correct. 
THE COURT: Okay.  Is anyone forcing you or making you 
do this? 
THE DEFENDANT: No. THE COURT: Is anyone putting any pressure on you? THE DEFENDANT: No. THE COURT: Anyone -- are you doing this voluntarily,
of your own free will? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes. THE COURT: I know you have two attorneys and you
probably discussed this matter in some detail yesterday and
probably again today.  Is that right? 
THE DEFENDANT: That's right. 
THE COURT: And you slept on it.  Is that a good way to 
put it?  Okay.  I just want to make sure, regardless of your
attorneys' advice, it is your decision and your decisionalone not to testify.  Is that correct? 
THE DEFENDANT: That's correct. 
THE COURT: Okay.  The Court, after questioning the 
4     
           
           
          
        
  
      
       
          
     
      
       
        
      
        
          
          
         
  
         
             
            
            
   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
defendant, finds that he has voluntarily, intelligently, and
knowingly decided not to testify in front of the jury. 
The defense then rested without calling any witnesses 
or presenting any evidence. 
During the settling of jury instructions, Adcock's 
counsel argued: "[W]e are dealing with two counts of the 
identical offense, and the record shows, in our view, a scintilla 
of evidence that this was a continuous course of conduct on 
October 10th, done with one intention or impulse.  We believe 
that a merger instruction[]  must be given."  The Circuit Court 
refused to provide the instruction.  The jury ultimately found Adcock guilty as charged for both counts of Terroristic 
Threatening in the First Degree. 4
The Circuit Court entered its Judgment on May 31, 
2019,  sentencing Adcock on each count to five years in prison, 
to be served concurrently, with credit for time served, and 5
4 Adcock proposed the following instruction: 
If and only if you find the Defendant guilty of any of
the offenses in Count 1 and Count 2, you must then determine
if the counts merge into a single offense and answer thefollowing questions on a special interrogatory that will beprovided to you: 
(1) Did the prosecution prove beyond a reasonabledoubt that the Defendant did not commit the offenses in Count 1 and Count 2 as part of acontinuing and uninterrupted course of conduct? 
(2) Did the prosecution prove beyond a reasonabledoubt that the Defendant committed the offenses in Count 1 and Count 2 with separate and distinctintents, rather than acting with one intention,one general impulse, and one plan to commit theseoffenses? 
Your answers to these questions must be unanimous. If youanswer both questions in the negative, the offenses merge. If any answer is answered in the affirmative, the offenses areseparate and distinct. 
5 The Judgment appears to mistakenly indicate that Adcock pled guilty
to the two counts of Terroristic Threatening in the First Degree. However, thejury verdict and Adcock's Opening Brief state that he pled not guilty andproceeded to jury trial, where the jury ultimately found him guilty on bothcounts of terroristic threatening. 
5 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
ordered him to pay a $105 CVC fee and a $100 ICAC fee, for a 
total of $410.  On the same day, Adcock moved to strike the 
imposition of the fees as being unconstitutional taxes.  The 
Circuit Court denied Adcock's motion to strike the imposition of 
the fees on June 26, 2019. 
II.  
POINTS OF ERROR 
On appeal, Adcock raises three points of error, 
contending that the Circuit Court erred by: (1) failing to 
conduct a "true colloquy" with him about his constitutional right 
to testify; (2) not providing the jury with a merger instruction 
under HRS ยง 701-109(1)(e) (2014); and (3) levying the $410.00 in 
fees, which he asserts "[wa]s an [u]nconstitutional [d]elegation 
of the [l]egislature's [t]axation [p]ower[.]" 
III.  STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A.  Waiver of Right to Testify 
We review whether a criminal defendant knowingly, 
intelligently, and voluntarily waived his or her right to testify under the right/wrong standard.  State v. Eduwensuyi, 141 Hawai# i 
328, 332-33, 409 P.3d 732, 736-37 (2018). B.  Jury Instructions 
In reviewing a trial court's refusal to give a jury 
instruction, we examine 
whether, when read and considered as a whole, the
instructions given are prejudicially insufficient,erroneous, inconsistent, or misleading.  Erroneous instructions are presumptively harmful and are a ground forreversal unless it affirmatively appears from the record asa whole that the error was not prejudicial.  In other words,error is not to be viewed in isolation and considered purelyin the abstract. 
State v. Matuu, 144 Hawai# i 510, 516, 445 P.3d 91, 97 (2019) 
(quoting State v. Kassebeer, 118 Hawai# i 493, 504, 193 P.3d 409, 
420 (2008)). 
C.  Constitutionality of Statutes 
[T]he constitutionality of a statute is a question of law
which is reviewable under the right/wrong standard.Additionally, where it is alleged that the legislature hasacted unconstitutionally, this court has consistently heldthat every enactment of the legislature is presumptively 
6 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
constitutional, and a party challenging the statute has the
burden of showing unconstitutionality beyond a reasonabledoubt.  The infraction should be plain, clear, manifest, andunmistakable. 
State v. Calaycay, 145 Hawai# i 186, 197, 449 P.3d 1184, 1195 
(2019) (quoting State v. Gaylord, 78 Hawai# i 127, 137, 890 P.2d 
1167, 1177 (1995)). 
IV.  DISCUSSION 
A.  Waiver of Right to Testify 
Adcock first alleges that the Circuit Court failed to 
engage in a "true colloquy" with him prior to the waiving of his 
right to testify at trial. 
Under Tachibana v. State, "trial courts must advise 
criminal defendants of their right to testify and must obtain an 
on-the-record waiver of that right in every case in which the 
defendant does not testify."  79 Hawai# i at 236, 900 P.2d at 
1303.  This colloquy is also required where the defendant does testify, "effectively making such a colloquy necessary in every 
trial."  State v. Torres, 144 Hawai# i 282, 285, 439 P.3d 234, 237 
(2019). 
A Tachibana colloquy has two components: an apprisal of 
the "fundamental principles pertaining to the right to testify and the right not to testify[,]" State v. Celestine, 142 Hawai# i 
165, 170, 415 P.3d 907, 912 (2018) (citing Tachibana, 79 Hawai# i 
at 236 n.7, 900 P.2d at 1303 n.7), and "a verbal exchange between 
the judge and the defendant 'in which the judge ascertains the 
defendant's understanding of the proceedings and of the 
defendant's rights[,]'" id. (emphasis omitted) (quoting State v. 
Han, 130 Hawai# i 83, 90, 306 P.3d 128, 135 (2013)).  Thus, a 
valid waiver of the right to testify necessarily follows an accurate advisement of rights and the defendant's acknowledgment 
of those rights.  Eduwensuyi, 141 Hawai# i at 336, 409 P.3d at 
740. 
In order to be a "true colloquy," the trial court 
cannot merely "recite[] a litany of rights" but must ascertain 
7 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
whether the defendant understood his or her rights and the 
protections associated with those rights, through a verbal 
exchange.  
State v. Pomroy, 132 Hawai# i 85, 93โ94, 319 P.3d 1093, 
1101โ02 (2014). 
The Circuit Court in this case properly advised Adcock 
of his rights both to testify and not to testify on two occasions.  See Tachibana, 79 Hawai# i at 236 n.7, 900 P.2d at 
1303 n.7 (instructing that the colloquy should advise the defendant "that he or she has a right to testify, that if he or 
she wants to testify that no one can prevent him or her from 
doing so, and that if he or she testifies the prosecution will be 
allowed to cross-examine him or her.  In connection with the 
privilege against self-incrimination, the defendant should also 
be advised that he or she has a right not to testify and that if 
he or she does not testify then the jury can be instructed about 
that right." (citation and brackets omitted)); Pomroy, 132 
Hawai# i at 91, 319 P.3d at 1099 (noting that footnote seven in 
Tachibana "stated the purpose and substance of the right-to-testify colloquy").  The record, however, lacks a verbal 
exchange after the Circuit Court apprised Adcock of his right not 
to testify on either of the two occasions, the first point at 
which Celestine advises the trial court to conduct such an 
exchange.  142 Hawai# i at 170, 415 P.3d at 912. 
Adcock argues that without a "true colloquy" there 
could not be a valid waiver of the right not to testify.  In 
Pomroy, the supreme court held, inter alia, that the lower court 
erred when it did not properly inform the defendant of his right 
to testify and the defendant subsequently decided not to testify. 
132 Hawai# i at 92-94, 319 P.3d at 1100-02.  Unlike here, the 
error in Pomroy was related to the right that Pomroy waived and therefore was not harmless.  See id. In this case, Adcock 
decided not to testify, thereby waiving his right to testify, but asserts that the Circuit Court's failure to engage in a "true 
colloquy" about his right not to testify warrants a new trial. 
8 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
We have previously held that when the deficiency in a 
Tachibana 
colloquy is not related to the right waived, the error appears 
harmless.  See State v. Pantke, No. CAAP-17-0000440, 2018 WL 
1918200, at *2 n.4 (Haw. App. Apr. 24, 2018) (SDO) ("Because 
th[e] error here . . . was in failing to properly advise Pantke 
of his right not to testify, and Pantke did not testify, the 
error appears to be harmless."); State v. Dykas, No. 
CAAP-17-0000352, 2018 WL 852202, at *2 (Haw. App. Feb. 14, 2018) 
(SDO) (determining that where the court omitted the advisement 
that no adverse inference could be made from the defendant not 
testifying and the defendant exercised her right not to testify, 
the omission had no effect on the defendant's decision not to 
testify because knowing that there would be no adverse 
consequences from her failure to testify would not have caused or 
influenced her to testify).  Therefore, even if we were to 
conclude that the Circuit Court erred in not obtaining verbal 
confirmation that Adcock understood his right not to testify, 
such error is harmless because Adcock did not waive that right. 
The crux of the issue is thus whether Adcock properly 
waived his right to testify.  To determine whether Adcock validly 
waived his right to testify we must look at the totality of the 
facts and circumstances in this case.  See Celestine, 142 Hawai# i 
at 171, 415 P.3d at 913.  After examining the totality of the facts and circumstances of the case before us, we conclude that 
Adcock knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his right 
to testify.  Decisive to our inquiry is the fact that Adcock 
concedes that on February 8, 2019, the Circuit Court "correctly 
inquired" whether he understood his right to testify, shortly 
before he waived that right.  On the previous day, his counsel 
announced he would testify, but Adcock retracted that decision 
and relayed that he "would like [the Circuit Court] to 
re-Tachibana him."  During the second colloquy, Adcock affirmed 
to the Circuit Court that he understood he had the right to 
testify.  His own affirmation that he understood the right to 
9 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
testify provides an objective basis for us to conclude that his 
waiver of the right to testify was knowing, intelligent, and 
voluntary.  
See id. at 170, 415 P.3d at 912.  Thus, the record 
shows that Adcock was properly advised of his right to testify, affirmed that he understood that he had the right to testify, and 
waived his right to testify. 
B.  Merger 
In his second point of error, Adcock alleges that the 
Circuit Court erred by refusing to instruct the jury on the law 
of merger. 
The law of merger, under HRS ยง 701โ109, "interposes a 
constraint on multiple convictions arising from the same criminal 
conduct" and "reflects a policy to limit the possibility of 
multiple convictions and extended sentences when the defendant 
has basically engaged in only one course of criminal conduct 
directed at one criminal goal, or when it would otherwise be 
unjust to convict the defendant for more than one offense." 
State v. Deguair, 139 Hawai# i 117, 128, 384 P.3d 893, 904 (2016) 
(internal quotation marks omitted) (first quoting State v. Matias, 102 Hawai# i 300, 305, 75 P.3d 1191, 1196 (2003) and then 
quoting Commentary to HRS ยง 701โ109); State v. Frisbee, 114 Hawai# i 76, 80โ81, 156 P.3d 1182, 1186โ87 (2007) (stating the 
same).  HRS ยง 701-109(1)(e) provides, in relevant part, that "[t]he defendant may not . . . be convicted of more than one 
offense if . . . [t]he offense is defined as a continuing course 
of conduct and the defendant's course of conduct was 
uninterrupted, unless the law provides that specific periods of 
conduct constitute separate offenses." 
In order for the court to be able to instruct the jury 
on the merger, all three elements of subsection (e) must apply: 
(1) the offense must be defined as a continuing course of 
conduct; (2) the defendant's conduct was uninterrupted; and (3) 
the law does not specify that periods within that course of 
conduct are separate offenses.  See HRS ยง 701-109(1)(e); State v. 
10 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Lavoie
, 145 Hawai# i 409, 431, 453 P.3d 229, 251 (2019). 
Central to the issue here is whether terroristic 
threatening with a dangerous weapon or simulated firearm is 
defined as continuing course of conduct.  Whether a particular 
criminal offense can be charged as a continuous offense is a 
question of law.  Lavoie, 145 Hawai# i at 431, 453 P.3d at 251 
(citing State v. Decoite, 132 Hawai# i 436, 442, 323 P.3d 80, 86 
(2014) (Pollack, J., dissenting)).  "The test for whether a crime 
can be charged as a continuous offense is whether the statute 
precludes charging an offense as a continuous offense, and 
whether the element(s) of the offense may constitute a 
continuous, unlawful act or series of acts, however long a time 
the act or acts may occur."  Id. (citing Decoite, 132 Hawai# i at 
438, 323 P.3d at 82 (majority opinion)). 
The State argues that HRS ยง 707-716(1)(a) (2014), 
threatening one victim on multiple occasions with a single intent, and subsection (b), threatening multiple victims on one 
occasion, are continuing courses of conduct, and by implication, 
the other subsections, including subsection (e) do not address 
continuing courses of conduct.  Without a doubt, the statutory 
definition of terroristic threatening under subsection (a) 
permits a showing that the offense "was committed by a series of 
acts constituting a continuing course of conduct."  State v. 
Apao, 95 Hawai# i 440, 447-48, 24 P.3d 32, 39-40 (2001) (denying 
specific unanimity instruction in terroristic threatening charge where the record indicated that multiple threats occurred over 
one uninterrupted occasion).  The supreme court did not address 
the remaining subsections but noted that "the very nature of 
threatening conduct connotes a combination or series of words 
and/or actions that together constitute a threat."  Id. at 447, 
24 P.3d at 39. 
Nothing in the language of HRS ยง 707-716(1)(e) 
"precludes" charging terroristic threatening with a dangerous 
instrument under subsection (e) as a continuous offense.  See 
11 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Lavoie
, 145 Hawai# i at 431, 453 P.3d at 251; State v. Arceo, 84 
Hawai# i 1, 18โ19, 928 P.2d 843, 860โ61 (1996) (stating that 
examples of "continuing offenses" include: first degree murder; 
first degree robbery; kidnapping, under certain circumstances; 
theft of a firearm; and theft of state property by deception; but 
do not include "sexual offenses"). 
Because terroristic threatening may be defined as a 
continuing course of conduct, HRS ยง 701-109(1) may apply.  "If 
there is a possibility that two counts of a complaint are 
'grounded in the same conduct,' HRS ยง 701-109(1) mandates, 'at a 
minimum, that the circuit court instruct the jury regarding 
merger.'"  State v. Wilson, No. 28478, 2009 WL 48141, at *18 
(Haw. App. Jan. 7, 2009) (mem. op.) (quoting Frisbee, 114 Hawai# i 
at 80, 156 P.3d at 1186). 
Whether a course of conduct gives rise to more than one
crime within the meaning of HRS ยง 701โ109(1)(e) depends inpart on the intent and objective of the defendant.  The test to determine whether the defendant intended to commit more than one offense is whether the evidence discloses one general intent or discloses separate and distinct intents.Where there is one intention, one general impulse, and oneplan, there is but one offense.  All factual issues involved in this determination must be decided by the trier of fact. 
State v. Hoey, 77 Hawai# i 17, 27 n.9 , 881 P.2d 504, 514 n.9 
(1994) (emphasis added) (brackets omitted) (quoting State v. 
Alston, 75 Haw. 517, 527โ28, 531, 865 P.2d 157, 163โ65 (1994)). 
Indeed, "the state of mind of the defendant at the time . . . 
will determine the number of charged crimes of which the 
defendant may properly be convicted, and merger is the means by 
which charging schemes that do not comport with the defendant's 
state of mind are corrected."  State v. Ganal, 81 Hawai# i 358, 
384, 917 P.2d 370, 396 (1996) (applying HRS ยง 701-109(1)(a) to convictions for first-degree murder and attempted first-degree 
murder involving multiple victims). 
The number of victims does not preclude the use of 
merger, where facts presented show only a general intent to 
commit the offense.  See, e.g., State v. Galante, No. 
12 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
CAAP-15-0000376, 2019 WL 926627, at *2 (Haw. App. Feb. 26, 2019) 
(SDO) (determining that two counts of Inattention to Driving 
merged where the defendant's conduct resulted in a single 
collision between the defendant's vehicle and a vehicle 
containing two people).  In 
Deguair, 139 Hawai# i at 128-129, 384 
P.3d at 904-05, the supreme court concluded that four kidnapping convictions, each involving a different victim, should merge with 
a robbery conviction because the jury had found that "each 
kidnapping was committed as a continuing course of conduct, with 
no separate and distinct intent from the robbery."  Thus, the 
supreme court emphasized that intent, and not the result of the 
conduct upon each victim, is paramount when applying merger. 
Here, the indictment cites the same conduct in both 
counts: "that [Adcock] . . . did threaten, by word or conduct, to 
cause bodily injury to Bert Kamaka and/or Billy Tagay, with the 
use of a dangerous instrument or a simulated firearm, to wit, a 
knife[.]"  The counts differ in the intent element, alleging that 
Adcock intended to terrorize or recklessly disregarded the risk 
of terrorizing, Kamaka in Count 1, and Tagay in Count 2. 
Adcock maintains on appeal that "[b]oth complainants 
testified that Mr. Adcock's words and conduct constituted the 
same act and that he threatened both complainants at the same 
time."  Kamaka testified that prior to starting work in the 
Kalama Park area on October 10, 2018, he warned his janitorial 
crew that a man had approached him at the park the day before and 
told Kamaka that he would cut and stab Kamaka if the crew touched 
the man's and another homeless man's belongings.  When the 
janitorial crew arrived at the park in the early morning of 
October 10, 2018, Adcock was pacing along a walkway leading to 
the bathroom with a kitchen knife.  Kamaka testified that Adcock 
approached the truck and crew with the kitchen knife while making 
stabbing motions, and yelled, "I'm going to stab you mother 
fuckers."  Tagay also testified that Adcock said he was going to 
stab them, while showing them the knife, and took steps towards 
13 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
where the crew was.  Tagay further stated that Adcock smirked at 
the crew and taunted them, "calling us losers and stuff." 
Adcock's statement to police after his arrest, however, was that 
he only addressed one of the members of the janitorial crew, 
asking him, "[Y]ou don't sound retarded, why are you stealing 
their jobs?"  Whether Adcock possessed a "separate and distinct 
intent" to terrorize Kamaka and Tagay individually was a factual 
issue to be determined by the trier of fact.  
See Hoey, 77 
Hawai# i at 27 n.9, 881 P.2d at 514 n.9.  The jury instructions 
were prejudicially insufficient, and thus the Circuit Court erred 
in refusing to instruct the jury regarding the merger of the two 
counts. 
Adcock maintains that a finding of instructional error 
requires that his sentence be vacated and remanded for a new 
trial. 
When a trial court plainly errs by failing to give a merger
instruction in the first place, the usual remedy is aretrial.  However, as noted approvingly by the Supreme Court of Hawai #i in Deguair, when, on appeal, the State suggests
dismissing one of the defendant's convictions to remedy thedefect rather than face wholesale retrial, the appellatecourt may remand for that purpose. 
State v. Hufanga, No. CAAP-17-0000737, 2019 WL 1487047, at *3 
(Haw. App. April 4, 2019) (SDO) (citations omitted). 
Accordingly, we vacate the judgment and remand, giving the State 
the option of retrying Adcock's charged offenses with the 
appropriate merger instruction or dismissing one of the 
terroristic threatening charges.  See State v. Padilla, 114 
Hawai# i 507, 517, 164 P.3d 765, 775 (App. 2007). 
C.  Post-Trial Fee Discussion 
Adcock claims that the Circuit Court's assessment of 
$410 was the result of an unconstitutional delegation of the legislature's taxation power to the judiciary.  Under the Hawai# i 
Constitution, the State has reserved the power of taxation to the legislature, but such power may be delegated by the legislature 
to the counties.  Hawaii Insurers Council v. Lingle, 120 Hawai# i 
14 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
51, 70, 201 P.3d 564, 583 (2008) (citing Haw. Const. art. VIII, ยง 
3); 
see also McCandless v. Campbell, 20 Haw. 411, 420 (Haw. Terr. 
1911) ("The power of taxation is essentially a legislative power. It cannot be delegated except to municipalities which themselves 
exercise subordinate legislative powers."). 
The fees here were created by the legislature, 
specifically under HRS ยง 351-62.6 (2015) and HRS ยง 846F-3 (2015). 
These statutes have a presumption of constitutionality and it is 
Adcock's burden to show unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable 
doubt.  Calaycay, 145 Hawai# i at 197, 449 P.3d at 1195. 
Because these fees were established by the legislature, 
they are distinguishable from the fees challenged in the cases 
Adcock relies upon.  Particularly, State v. Medeiros, 89 Hawai# i 
361, 973 P.2d 736 (1999), concerned fees established by a Honolulu municipal ordinance, and Hawaii Insurers Council, 120 
Hawai# i 51, 201 P.3d 564, concerned fees established by the 
Insurance Commission, a regulatory agency. 
Adcock bases his argument that the legislature 
impermissibly delegated its taxation power to the judiciary on the assertion that the "fees" assessed as part of his sentence 
were not "fees," but rather "taxes."  Adcock posits that "[a]ny 
charge 'imposed by the government on persons, entities, 
transactions, or property to yield public revenue' is a tax." 
This is a faulty syllogism based on the Black's Law Dictionary 
definition quoted in Hawaii Insurers Council which defines tax as 
"[a] monetary charge imposed by the government on persons, 
entities, transactions, or property to yield public revenue." 
120 Hawai# i at 60, 201 P.3d at 573 (quoting Black's Law 
Dictionary 1496 (8th ed. 2004)).  Adcock ignores that the court emphasized that "[n]ot every exaction by state authorities is a 
tax."  Id. at 59, 201 P.3d at 572 (brackets in original) (quoting 
Hexom v. Oregon Dep't of Transp., 177 F.3d 1134, 1135 (9th Cir. 
1999)). 
The nature of a charge imposed by law "is not 
15 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
determined by the label given to it but by its operating 
incidence."  
Medeiros, 89 Hawai# i at 366, 973 P.2d at 741 
(quoting Stewarts' Pharmacies v. Fase, 43 Haw. 131, 144 (1959)); see also People v. Graves, 919 N.E.2d 906, 910 (Ill. 2009) 
("[T]he statutory labels applied to a charge do not control where 
the purpose of the charge contradicts that label." (citing People 
v. Jones, 861 N.E.2d 967, 985-86 (Ill. 2006))).  Therefore, it is 
inconsequential that the charges that Adcock challenges are 
labeled as "fees." 
The Hawai# i Supreme Court has defined "taxes" as 
follows: 
Taxes are the enforced proportional contributions from
persons and property, levied by the state by virtue of its
sovereignty for the support of government, and for allpublic needs. 
Taxes are generally defined as burdens or charges
imposed by legislative authority on persons or property toraise money for public purposes, or, more briefly, animposition for the supply of the public treasury. 
The word taxes is very comprehensive, and properly
includes, as indicated in the foregoing definition, allburdens, charges and impositions by virtue of the taxingpower with the object of raising money for public purposes. 
Hawaii Insurers Council, 120 Hawai# i at 59โ60, 201 P.3d at 572โ73 
(quoting McCandless, 20 Haw. at 420). 
A fee is a charge that "(1) applies to the direct 
beneficiary of a particular service, (2) is allocated directly to 
defraying the costs of providing the service, and (3) is 
reasonably proportionate to the benefit received."  Medeiros, 89 
Hawai# i at 367, 973 P.2d at 742 (modifying the test enunciated in 
Emerson College v. City of Boston, 462 N.E.2d 1098, 1105 (Mass. 1984)).  The supreme court has further distinguished between user 
fees and regulatory fees.  A user fee, such as a bridge toll or 
charges for sewer hookups or wastewater management, is "based on 
the rights of the entity as a proprietor of the instrumentalities 
used."  Hawaii Insurers Council, 120 Hawai# i at 60, 201 P.3d at 
573 (quoting Medeiros, 89 Hawai# i at 366, 973 P.2d at 741).  A 
user fee is generally charged to the recipient of a service 
16 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
provided by the government.  
Id. at 62, 201 P.3d at 575.  In 
contrast, regulatory fees, such as licensing and inspection fees, 
are "founded on the police power to regulate particular 
businesses or activities."  Id. (quoting Medeiros, 89 Hawai# i at 
366, 973 P.2d at 741). 
The Attorney General, in an amicus brief, posits a 
third possibility: that the assessed charges are "fines."  A "'fine' is 'a pecuniary punishment or penalty[.]'"  Casumpang v. 
ILWU Local 142, 108 Hawai# i 411, 422, 121 P.3d 391, 402 (2005) 
(quoting Black's Law Dictionary 6th ed. 1990)).  More specifically, it is a "a retributive payment due the sovereign." 
State v. Toyomura, 80 Hawai# i 8, 18 n.14, 904 P.2d 893, 903 n.14 
(1995) (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Gaylord, 78 Hawai# i at 152, 890 P.2d at 1192).  Fines 
are included in the punishments prescribed by the legislature in HRS ยง 706-605 (2014 & Supp. 2018).  See also State v. Nunes, 72 
Haw. 521, 524, 824 P.2d 837, 839 (1992).  Under the Hawaii Penal 
Code, fines are permitted in addition to a sentence of 
imprisonment or incarceration where "[t]he court is of the 
opinion that a fine is specially adapted to the deterrence of the 
crime involved or to the correction of the defendant."  HRS ยง 
706-641(2)(b) (2014). 
The Illinois Supreme Court has held that "the central 
characteristic which separates a fee from a fine" is "whether the 
charge seeks to compensate the state for any costs incurred as 
the result of prosecuting the defendant."  Graves, 919 N.E.2d at 
910 (citing Jones, 861 N.E.2d at 986).  "A charge is a fee if and 
only if it is intended to reimburse the state for some cost 
incurred in defendant's prosecution."  Id. A fine, on the other 
hand, is imposed only after conviction for a criminal offense and is payable to the State treasury, and may, but is not required 
to, vary with the severity of the behavior.  See Jones, 861 
N.E.2d at 975, 986. 
Of the three classifications, the ICAC fee and CVC fee 
17 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
most resemble fines.  Both are penalties imposed after criminal 
convictions, both are to be paid into special funds in the State 
treasury that do not reimburse payments related to the 
defendant's prosecution, and in the case of the CVC special fund, 
the severity of the crime is a criterion to be considered when 
the court orders the payment. 
The fees in question are punitive in nature.  HRS ยง 
706-605(6) mandates that the court "shall impose a compensation 
fee upon every person convicted of a criminal offense pursuant to 
section 351-62.6," which in turn provides that the fee must be 
imposed on every defendant convicted and "who is or will be able 
to pay the compensation fee."  Similarly, HRS ยง 846F-3 requires 
the court to order "every defendant to pay an internet crimes 
against children fee of up to $100 for each felony or misdemeanor 
conviction; provided that no fee shall be ordered when the court 
determines that the defendant is unable to pay the fee." 
Therefore, the legislature authorized the imposition of the 
charges at issue here as a punishment for criminal behavior. 
The charges were not created to offset the costs of 
prosecution.  The CVC special fund, which is supported in part by 
fees authorized under HRS ยง 351-62.6, is intended "to aid victims 
of criminal acts, by providing compensation for victims of 
certain crimes or dependents of deceased victims[.]"  HRS ยง 351-1 
(2015).  ICAC fees are to be deposited in a special fund that 
shall be expended by the Attorney General to train, equip, and 
enable local law enforcement agencies in investigating and 
prosecuting internet crimes against children, and to assist 
groups working directly to combat internet crimes against 
children.  HRS ยง 846F-4(b) (2015).  Although Adcock is correct in 
stating that money from the charges do not "defray any costs for 
services to the defendants," which weighs against considering the 
charges to be "fees" as described in 
Medeiros and Hawaii Insurers 
Council, that point does not preclude them from being fines. 
Further supporting the conclusion that the CVC fee is a 
18 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
fine, the statute authorizing it requires the court to consider 
HRS ยง 706-641, which applies to other criminal fines, when 
determining the amount a defendant must pay.  
See HRS ยง 
351-62.6(b).  The statute also directs that 
the court shall consider all relevant factors, including but
not limited to: 
(1) The seriousness of the offense; 
(2) The circumstances of the commission of the 
offense; 
(3) The economic gain, if any, realized by the
defendant; 
(4) The number of victims; and (5) The defendant's earning capacity, including
future earning capacity. 
(c) The compensation fee shall be considered a civil
judgment. 
HRS ยง 351-62.6(b), (c).  Thus, the rates vary, in part, with the 
seriousness of the offense, a factor demonstrating that a charge 
is a fine under Jones. 
Adcock complains that these fees turn the courts into 
revenue centers for the State.  On this point, comparison to 
Medeiros is instructive.  The ordinance held to be 
unconstitutional in Medeiros gave the city discretion to use the 
funds in accordance with the city's annual operating budget, 
rather than mandated that they be used on the law enforcement 
objectives for which the "service fee" was purportedly 
established.  89 Hawai# i at 367 & n.5, 973 P.2d at 742 & n.5. 
Thus, the supreme court found, there was a "possibility that the charge could be used for general revenue raising purposes, the 
classic realm of taxation."  Id. at 367, 973 P.2d at 742.  In 
contrast, the CVC fee and ICAC fee are deposited into special 
funds, which are required by statute to be expended for limited 
purposes; their use is not discretionary.  "Moneys received [in 
the CVC special fund] shall be used for compensation payments, 
operating expenses, salaries of positions as authorized by the 
19 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
legislature, and collection of fees."  HRS ยง 351-62.5(d) 
(emphasis added).  Likewise, HRS ยง 846F-4(b) mandates that funds 
in the ICAC special fund be used 
(1) To provide training and equipment for local law
enforcement agencies to use in investigating andprosecuting internet crimes against children,including funding to increase the forensic capacity ofdigital evidence; 
(2) To enable law enforcement to investigate and prosecuteinternet crimes against children; and 
(3) To assist groups working directly to combat internetcrimes against children. 
Because the use of the funds is controlled by a mandatory rather 
than discretionary statute, the fees cannot be classified as 
taxes.  See Medeiros, 89 Hawai# i at 367 & n.5, 973 P.2d at 742 & 
n.5. 
Finally, Adcock complains that "[n]one of his offenses 
are in any way related to internet crimes against children."  To the extent that we read this complaint as an argument that the 
statute violates his right to substantive due process because 
there is no rational basis for the imposition of the ICAC fee, we 
disagree.  As we previously recited, it is well established that 
"every enactment of the legislature is presumptively 
constitutional, and a party challenging the statute has the 
burden of showing unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt. 
The infraction should be plain, clear, manifest, and 
unmistakable."  Calaycay, 145 Hawai# i at 197, 449 P.3d at 1195 
(quoting Gaylord, 78 Hawai# i at 137, 890 P.2d at 1177).  "Under 
rational basis review, a statute must 'rationally further a 
legitimate state interest.'  A state interest is 'legitimate' if 
it involves the public health, safety, or welfare."  State v. 
Mallan, 86 Hawai# i 440, 451โ52, 950 P.2d 178, 189โ90 (1998) 
(quoting Estate of Coates v. Pac. Engineering, 71 Haw. 358, 363โ64, 791 P.2d 1257, 1260 (1990)).  The legislature determined 
that assessing this charge serves the public safety and welfare 
because it serves a punitive purpose against those who are 
20 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
convicted, and it furthers the legitimate state interest of 
pursuing those who commit internet crimes against children by 
providing funding for the program as described in HRS chapter 
846F.  The Circuit Court recognized this, and, citing 
State v. 
Peraza, 467 S.W.3d 508 (Tex. 2015), concluded that the funds were expended for "legitimate criminal justice purposes."  There is 
sufficient justification for the fees to survive rational basis 
scrutiny. 
Adcock has not met his burden of showing that the 
statutes under which he was ordered to pay fees as part of his 
sentence are unconstitutional.  "[W]hile a sentence may be 
authorized by a constitutionally valid statute, its imposition 
may be reviewed for plain and manifest abuse of discretion." 
State v. Martin, 103 Hawai# i 68, 74, 79 P.3d 686, 692 (App. 2003) 
(quoting Gaylord, 78 Hawai# i at 144, 890 P.2d at 1184). 
"Generally, to constitute an abuse[,] it must appear that the 
court clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules 
or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of 
a party litigant."  Id. 
Adcock complains that the sentencing court has 
"unfettered discretion in fixing" the fees.  To the contrary, HRS 
ยง 706-605(6) requires the imposition of the CVC fee on every 
person convicted of a criminal offense, but HRS ยง 351-62.6 
provides that the court shall waive the fee if the court finds 
that the defendant is unable to pay.  Similarly, the ICAC fee is 
contingent on the defendant's ability to pay.  Adcock's counsel 
twice admitted that the objection was not based on Adcock being 
unable to pay.  Accordingly, the Circuit Court did not abuse its 
discretion in imposing the mandatory fines against Adcock.
