IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
SYLVIA CABRAL, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
LAURIE HAYES, Defendant-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
WAILUKU DIVISION 
(CASE NO. 2RC181001170) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL 
(By:  Chan, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Upon review of (1) this appeal by self-represented 
Plaintiff-Appellant Sylvia Cabral (Cabral) from the district 
court's June 20, 2019 order denying Cabral's motion to seal court 
records and consolidate eight cases in District Court Civil 
No. 2RC181001170, (2) the record, (3) the April 6, 2020 order 
temporarily remanding this case with instructions for the 
district court to file, within thirty days, either (a) a final 
judgment or (b) an explanation why doing so would be impossible 
or inappropriate, and (4) the district court clerk's May 15, 2020 
declaration that the district court has not filed a final 
judgment in response to the April 6, 2020 remand order, it 
appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction over Cabral's appeal 
because, at this time, the district court has not entered a 
written order or written judgment adjudicating Cabral's complaint 
in District Court Civil No. 2RC181001170, as Hawaii Revised 
Statutes ยง 641-1(a) (2016) requires for an appeal under the NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
holding in Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142 , 91 Hawai# i 425, 426-27, 
984 P.2d 1251, 1252-53 (1999). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court 
case number CAAP-19-0000511 is dismissed for lack of appellate 
jurisdiction. 
DATED: 
Honolulu, Hawai# i, June 3, 2020.
