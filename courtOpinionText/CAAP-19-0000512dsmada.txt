SYLVIA CABRAL, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
LAURIE HAYES, Defendant-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
WAILUKU DIVISION 
(CASE NO. 2RC181001447) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL 
(By:  Chan, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Upon review of (1) this appeal by Plaintiff-Appellant 
Sylvia Cabral (Cabral) (whose counsel of record, Benjamin M. 
Acob, has never formally withdrawn as her attorney) from the 
district court's April 2, 2019 order denying Cabral's motion to 
seal court records and consolidate eight cases in District Court 
Civil No. 2RC181001447, (2) the record, (3) the April 6, 2020 
order temporarily remanding this case with instructions for the 
district court to file, within thirty days, either (a) a final 
judgment or (b) an explanation why doing so would be impossible 
or inappropriate, and (4) the district court clerk's May 15, 2020 
declaration that the district court has not filed a final 
judgment in response to the April 6, 2020 remand order, it 
appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction over Cabral's appeal 
because the district court has not yet entered a written order or 
written judgment adjudicating Cabral's complaint in District 
Court Civil No. 2RC181001447, as Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 641
