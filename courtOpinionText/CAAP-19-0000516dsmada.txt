SYLVIA CABRAL, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
LAURIE HAYES, Defendant-Appellee
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
WAILUKU DIVISION
(2SC181000228)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By:  Chan, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.)
Upon review of (1) this appeal by self-represented
Plaintiff-Appellant Sylvia Cabral ( Cabral) from the June 20, 2019
order denying Cabral's motion to seal court records and
consolidate eight cases in District Court Small Claims No. 18-1-
00220, and (2) the record, it appears that we lack appellate
jurisdiction over Cabral's appeal because there is no statutory
right to appeal from a District Court Small Claims case.
"There is no common law right to appeal.  The right to
appeal is purely statutory, and exists only when given by some
constitutional or statutory provision."  Greer v. Baker, 137
Hawai#i 249, 252, 369 P.3d 832, 835 (2016) (citation and internal
quotation marks omitted).  Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 633-28(a)
(2016) expressly provides that "[t]here shall be no appeal from a
judgment of the small claims division[.]"  See, e.g., Chambers v.
Leavey, 60 Haw. 52, 57, 587 P.2d 807, 810 (1978) (acknowledging
that there is no statutory right to appeal from a judgment of theElectronically Filed

small claims division).  As Rule 12(b) of the Rules of the Small
Claims Division of the District Courts acknowledges, there is
"[n]o right of appeal.  A party may not appeal from a judgment of
the small claims division."
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appeal number
CAAP-19-0000516 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions
in appeal number CAAP-19-0000516 are dismissed as moot.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, April 6, 2020.
