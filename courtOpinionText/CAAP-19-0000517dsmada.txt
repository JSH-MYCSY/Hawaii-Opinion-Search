NO. CAAP-19-0000517
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
SYLVIA CABRAL, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
LAURIE HAYES, Defendant-Appellee
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
WAILUKU DIVISION
(2SS181000230)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By:  Chan, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.)
Upon review of this appeal by self-represented
Petitioner-Appellant Sylvia Cabral ( Cabral) from the March 28,
2019 order in District Court Civil No. 18-1-00230 denying
Cabral's motion to seal court records and consolidate eight
District Court cases, it appears that we lack appellate
jurisdiction over Cabral's appeal because Cabral's notice of
appeal is untimely under Rule 4(a)(1) of the Hawai#i Rules of
Appellate Procedure (HRAP).
The District Court's August 30, 2018 order denying
Cabral's petition for ex parte temporary restraining order and
for injunction against harassment pursuant to HRS ยง 604-10.5
(2016) against Respondent-Appellee Laurie Hayes was an appealable
final order pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-1(a)
(2016) and the holding in Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91
Hawai#i 425, 426-27, 984 P.2d 1251, 1252-53 (1999).  All
subsequent orders were post-judgment orders.  Any "post-judgmentElectronically Filed

order is an appealable final order under HRS ยง 641-1(a) if the
order ends the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be
accomplished."  Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 Hawai# i 153, 157, 80 P.3d
974, 978 (2003) (citation omitted).
The March 28, 2019 order finally determined, and thus
ended, the proceeding on Cabral's post-judgment motion to seal
court records and consolidate eight District Court cases.  The
March 28, 2019 post-judgment order was an appealable final post-
judgment order pursuant to HRS ยง 641-1(a).
Cabral did not file her July 16, 2019 notice of appeal
in appeal number CAAP-19-0000517 within thirty days after entry
of the March 28, 2019 post-judgment order, as required by HRAP
Rule 4(a)(1).  The failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a
civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot
waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise
of judicial discretion.  Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727
P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or
justice is authorized to change the jurisdictional requirements
contained in Rule 4 of these rules."); HRAP Rule 26(e) ("The
reviewing court for good cause shown may relieve a party from a
default occasioned by any failure to comply with these rules,
except the failure to give timely notice of appeal.").
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appeal number
CAAP-19-0000517 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions
in appeal number CAAP-19-0000517 are dismissed as moot.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, April 6, 2020.
