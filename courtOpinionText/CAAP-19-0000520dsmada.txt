IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
SYLVIA CABRAL, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
LAURIE HAYES, Defendant-Appellee
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
WAILUKU DIVISION
(2SS181000210)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By:  Chan, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.)
Upon review of this appeal by self-represented
Petitioner-Appellant Sylvia Cabral ( Cabral) from the March 29,
2019 order in District Court Civil No. 18-1-00210 denying
Cabral's motion to seal court records and consolidate eight
District Court cases, it appears that we lack appellate
jurisdiction over Cabral's appeal because Cabral's notice of
appeal is untimely under Rule 4(a)(1) of the Hawai#i Rules of
Appellate Procedure (HRAP).
The District Court's August 13, 2018 order dissolving a
prior August 3, 2018 injunction against harassment pursuant to
HRS ยง 604-10.5 (2016) against Respondent-Appellee Laurie Hayes,
was an appealable final order pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes
(HRS) ยง 641-1(a) (2016) and the holding in Casumpang v. ILWU,
Local 142, 91 Hawai# i 425, 426-27, 984 P.2d 1251, 1252-53 (1999). 
All subsequent orders were post-judgment orders, and any "post-
judgment order is an appealable final order under HRS ยง 641-1(a)Electronically Filed

if the order ends the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be 
accomplished."  Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 Hawai# i 153, 157, 80 P.3d
974, 978 (2003) (citation omitted).
The March 29, 2019 order finally determined, and, thus,
ended the proceeding on Cabral's post-judgment motion to seal
court records and consolidate eight District Court cases by
denying that post-judgment motion in its entirety, leaving
nothing further for the District Court to accomplish in that
particular post-judgment proceeding.  Therefore, the March 29,
2019 post-judgment order was an independently appealable final
order pursuant to HRS ยง 641-1(a).
However, Cabral did not file her July 15, 2019 notice
of appeal in appeal number CAAP-19-0000520 within thirty days
after entry of the March 29, 2019 post-judgment order, as
required by HRAP Rule 4(a)(1).  The failure to file a timely
notice of appeal in a civil matter is a jurisdictional defect
that the parties cannot waive and the appellate courts cannot
disregard in the exercise of judicial discretion.  Bacon v.
Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP
Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or justice is authorized to
change the jurisdictional requirements contained in Rule 4 of
these rules."); HRAP Rule 26(e) ("The reviewing court for good
cause shown may relieve a party from a default occasioned by any
failure to comply with these rules, except the failure to give
timely notice of appeal.").
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appeal number
CAAP-19-0000520 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions
in appeal number CAAP-19-0000520 are dismissed as moot.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, April 6, 2020.
