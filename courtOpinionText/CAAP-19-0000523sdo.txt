 Denying Motion for 60(b) Relief) filed by the Circuit Court of 
the Second Circuit (Circuit Court).1  
  On appeal, the Curriers contend that the Circuit Court erred in denying their Motion for 60(b) Relief,
2 "where the 
underlying nonjudicial foreclosure relied upon by [Plaintiff-
Appellee Aurora Loan Services, LLC (Aurora)] in pursuing 
judgment was invalid and void, due to Aurora's failure to publish notice of its rescheduled foreclosure auction," under 
Hungate v. Law Off. of David B. Rosen, 139 Hawai‘ i 394, 391 P.3d 
1 (2017), abrogated on other grounds by State ex rel. Shikada v. 
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., 152 Hawai‘ i 418, 526 P.3d 395 (2023).3  
  Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issue raised, we affirm. 
 
 1  The Honorable Joseph E. Cardoza presided. 
 
 2  HRCP Rule 60(b) entitled "Mistakes; inadvertence; excusable 
neglect; newly discovered evidence; fraud, etc." states in pertinent part:  
On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may 
relieve a party or a party's legal representative from a 
final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following 
reasons:  . . . (4) the judgment is void; . . . or (6) any 
other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment. . . . 
 
While the Curriers contend they are entitled to relief  
under subsections (b)(4) and (b)(6) of HRCP Rule 60, they fail to provide argument pertinent to (b)(6).  "A party seeking relief under HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) after the time of appeal has run must establish the 
existence of ' extraordinary circumstances' that prevented or rendered 
him unable to prosecute an appeal."  Application of Hana Ranch Co., 
Ltd., 3 Haw. App. 141, 147, 642 P.2d 938, 942 (1982) (citations 
omitted).  The Curriers' claim of error under HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) is 
waived.  See Hawai‘i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(7). 
 
3  In Hungate, which also involved a nonjudicial foreclosure as 
here, the Hawai‘ i Supreme Court held that because the power of sale clause in 
the mortgage required the bank to publish postponements of the foreclosure 
sale, the circuit court erroneously dismissed the plaintiff's claims that the 
foreclosure was wrongful for failure to publish postponements of the sale 
through a new notice.  139 Hawai‘ i at 403- 04, 391 P.3d at 10- 11.       NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

   On April 3, 2014, the Curriers appealed the Circuit 
Court's March 4, 2014 order, judgment for possession, and writ of possession in favor of Aurora and against the Curriers on Aurora's June 22, 2011 "Complaint for Ejectment."  After the Curriers failed to submit an opening brief, this court dismissed 
the appeal on March 2, 2015.  
 On May 30, 2019, five years after the entry of the 
March 4, 2014 judgment and writ of possession, the Curriers 
filed their Motion for 60(b) Relief relevant to this appeal.  On June 10, 2019, Aurora filed an opposition to the Motion, the Curriers filed a reply on June 17, 2019, and the Circuit Court denied the motion on July 1, 2019.  
  "A circuit court's decision on an HRCP Rule 60(b) motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion[.]"  PennyMac Corp v. 
Godinez, 148 Hawai‘ i 323, 327, 474 P.3d 264, 268 (2020) (quoting 
Haw. Hous. Auth. v. Uyehara, 77 Hawai‘ i 144, 147, 883 P.2d 65, 68 
(1994)).  "The burden of establishing abuse of discretion in denying an HRCP Rule 60(b) motion is on the appellant, and a strong showing is required to establish it."  Id. (cleaned up).   
  The Curriers' sole argument on appeal is that the "nonjudicial foreclosure is void as a matter of law" because under Hungate, "[n]o evidence was produced showing that notice 
of rescheduling [the auction sale] had been published, which was required under the power of sale."  Aurora responds, inter alia, 
that under Hawai‘ i law, "even where it is determined that a 
nonjudicial foreclosure of a mortgage is somehow wrongful, the 
sale of the property may be 'voidable' at the timely election of the mortgagor——as opposed to 'void as a matter of law.'"  Aurora's argument has merit. 
HRCP Rule 60(b)(4) provides for relief from a judgment 
when "the judgment is void[.]"

 Mortg. LLC, 150 Hawai‘ i 91, 101-02, 497 P.3d 106, 116-17 (2021), 
the Hawai‘ i Supreme Court held that:  
a wrongful foreclosure that violates the power of sale is 
voidable, not void. This conclusion flows from our cases 
that make clear that if a foreclosure violates a statute 
governing the nonjudicial foreclosure scheme, or other law 
extrinsic to the mortgage itself, the sale is " voidable at 
the election of the mortgagor," and in turn, "where the 
property has passed into the hands of an innocent purchaser 
for value, an action at law for damages is generally the appropriate remedy."  
 
(emphasis added) (cleaned up).  Thus, even where a nonjudicial 
foreclosure may be wrongful due to failure to strictly comply 
with the power of sale, the remedy recognized under Hawai‘ i law 
is to render such a foreclosure voidable, not void as the 
Curriers contend.  As the Curriers do not raise any other argument why the March 4, 2014 Judgment is void under HRCP Rule 
60(b)(4), we conclude the Circuit Court did not abuse its 
discretion by denying the Curriers' Motion for 60(b) Relief.  
See PennyMac Corp., 148 Hawai‘ i at 327, 474 P.3d at 268; HRAP 
Rule 28(b)(7). 
  For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the July 1, 2019 
"Order Denying Defendants Randolph Goodwin Currier and Stacey Marie Currier's HRCP Rule 60(b) Motion for Relief from Judgment" filed by the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit.
