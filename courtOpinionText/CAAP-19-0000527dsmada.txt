NO. CAAP-19-0000527
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI #I
GAIL P. PACHECO, Plaintiff-Appellant v.
LANIAKEA INC.; ROBERT SANCHEZ, President, Defendants-Appellees
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
H
ONOLULU DIVISION
(CASE NO. 1RC19-1-002313)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By: Ginoza, C.J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
appellate jurisdiction over this appeal by Plaintiff-Appellant
Gail P. Pacheco (Pacheco), self-represented, from District Court
Civil No. 1RC19-1-002313, because, at the time Pacheco filed her
July 18, 2019 notice of appeal, the Honorable Hilary B. Gangnes
had not yet announced her decision to grant Defendants-Appellees
Laniakea, Inc. and Robert Sanchez's motion to dismiss Pacheco's
complaint.
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-1(a) (2016)
authorizes an appeal from a district court's final judgment or
final order that finally determines, and, thus, ends the
proceedings, leaving nothing further for the district court to
adjudicate.  Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai#i 425, 426-
27, 984 P.2d 1251, 1252-53 (1999).  On July 22, 2019, the
district court entered minutes indicating that Judge Gangnesannounced her intent to grant Laniakea and Sanchez's motion to
dismiss Pacheco's complaint, which would end this entire district
court proceeding.  However, a district court's "oral decision is
not an appealable order."  KNG Corp. v. Kim, 107 Hawai#i 73, 77,
110 P.3d 397, 401 (2005).  "In civil cases before the district
court, '[t]he filing of the judgment in the office of the clerk
constitutes the entry of the judgment; and the judgment is not
effective before such entry.'  District Court Rules of Civil
Procedure Rule 58."  Id.  In the absence of an appealable final
written judgment or written order in the record, we cannot assume
appellate jurisdiction over Pacheco's appeal pursuant to HRS
ยง 641-1(a).
HRAP Rule 4(a)(2) provides that, "[i]f a notice of
appeal is filed after announcement of a decision but before entry
of the judgment or order, such notice shall be considered as
filed immediately after the time the judgment or order becomes
final for the purpose of appeal."  (Emphasis added).  Pacheco
filed her July 18, 2019 notice of appeal four days before the
district court announced in the July 22, 2019 district court
minutes that the district court intends to grant Laniakea and
Sanchez's motion to dismiss Pacheco's complaint.  Under the
equivalent rule for premature notices of appeal in criminal
cases, HRAP Rule 4(b)(4), when a party attempted to assert an
appeal from a circuit court proceeding for a petition for post-
conviction relief pursuant to Rule 40 of the Hawai#i Rules of
Penal Procedure (HRPP) before the circuit court announced its
decision, the Supreme Court of Hawai#i held that the notice of
appeal was a legal nullity, despite that HRAP Rule 4(b)(4)
authorized premature appeals from a trial court's announcement of
its decision:
Thus, pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(b), an appeal from an order
denying post-conviction relief must either be filed within
thirty days after the entry of the order denying the HRPP
Rule 40 petition or, in the alternative, after the
announcement but before the entry of the order.
2Grattafiori filed his notice of appeal three weeks
before the circuit court entered its order denying his
amended second HRPP Rule 40 petition. Nothing in the record
indicates that the circuit court had entered any order (on
October 15, 1993 or at any other time) prior to January 21,
1994, the date on which Grattafiori filed his notice of
appeal. Similarly, the record does not reflect that the
circuit court announced its decision before that date, so as
to enable Grattafiori's notice of appeal from the oral
decision to be treated as an appeal from the subsequently
filed order. Thus, we must conclude that Grattafiori's
notice of appeal, dated January 21, 1994, has no legal
effect, insofar as there is no jurisdictional basis upon
which to file an appeal from an order that has not yet been
announced or entered. See HRS ยง 641-11 (Supp.1992); HRPP
40(h); HRAP Rule 4(b).
. . . .
We hold, therefore, that Grattafiori's January 21,
1994 notice of appeal constitutes a legal nullity because,
at the time of filing, there was neither an oral decision
nor a written order from which to appeal. While we treat an
appeal as timely where a defendant has filed his or her
notice of appeal after the court has announced an oral
decision but before the entry of a written order or
judgment, see HRAP 4(b), we cannot do so where the court has
rendered no decision whatsoever. After the circuit court
entered its written order on February 14, 1994, denying the
amended second HRPP Rule 40 petition, Grattafiori was
entitled under HRAP 4(b) to thirty days within which to file
a new notice of appeal. He failed to do so. Consequently, we
are without jurisdiction to address the merits of
Grattafiori's appeal.
Grattafiori v. State, 79 Hawai#i 10, 13-14, 897 P.2d 937, 940-41
(1995) (emphases added).  Similarly in the instant case,
Pacheco's July 18, 2019 notice of appeal is a legal nullity
because, as of July 18, 2019, the district court had neither
orally announced its decision nor entered a final written
judgment or written order.  While we treat a premature notice of
appeal as timely under HRAP Rule 4(a)(2) when a party has filed
his or her notice of appeal after the trial court has announced
an oral decision but before the entry of a written judgment or
written order, we cannot do so under HRAP Rule 4(a)(2) when an
aggrieved party files a notice of appeal before the district
court has announced its decision.  The failure to file a timely
notice of appeal in a civil matter is a jurisdictional defect
that the parties cannot waive and the appellate courts cannot
disregard in the exercise of judicial discretion.  Bacon v.
3Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP Rule
26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or justice is authorized to change
the jurisdictional requirements contained in Rule 4 of these
rules."); HRAP Rule 26(e) ("The reviewing court for good cause
shown may relieve a party from a default occasioned by any
failure to comply with these rules, except the failure to give
timely notice of appeal.").
 Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED AND DECREED that CAAP-
19-0000527 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that any pending motions in CAAP-
19-0000527 are dismissed.
