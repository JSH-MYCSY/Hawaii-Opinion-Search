Upon careful review of the record, the briefs 
submitted by the parties, their responses to our April 23, 2024 
Order to Show Cause (OSC) regarding mootness, and having given 
due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we dismiss. 
Rohr's appeal challenges whether the Public Utilities 
Commission's (PUC) 2017 approval of Hawaiʻ i Electric Light 
Company, Inc.'s ( 
HELCO) amended power purchase agreement (PPA) 
(2017 PPA Approval) with Hu Honua violated the Hawaiʻ i 
Environmental Policy Act (HEPA). On September 20, 2018, the Environmental Court held that the 2017 PPA Approval did not trigger HEPA review because the PPA was not an "action," and granted summary judgment on Rohr's Complaint.

Matter of Haw. Elec. Light Co., Inc. (HELCO III), 152 Hawaiʻ i 
352, 526 P.3d 329 (2023), entered since the filing of the record 
in this appeal. 
Appellant Life of the Land appealed the 2017 PPA 
Approval and denial of its intervention in HELCO I; and in 2019, 
the Hawaiʻ i Supreme Court vacated the 2017 PPA Approval, 
instructing the PUC to hold a new hearing on the PPA and allowing Life of the Land to participate. 145 
Hawaiʻi at 10, 25, 
445 P.3d at 682, 697. Following the hearing on remand, Hu Honua 
appealed regarding the scope of the remand in HELCO II, and in 
2021, the Hawaiʻ i Supreme Court remanded for the PUC to conduct a 
new contested case hearing on the PPA. 149 
Hawaiʻi at 241-42, 
487 P.3d at 710-11. In 2022, the PUC issued an order denying 
the PPA (2022 PPA Denial) because it found that the PPA "was not 
in the public interest." HELCO III, 152 Hawaiʻ i at 356, 526 P.3d 
at 333. Hu Honua appealed, and the 2022 PPA Denial was affirmed 
by the supreme court in 2023 in 
HELCO III. Id.
 at 356, 359, 526 
P.3d at 333, 336. 
We issued an April 23, 2024 OSC, requesting the 
parties to respond regarding whether this appeal should be dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction due to mootness, where the 2017 PPA Approval was vacated in HELCO I; the PPA was 
ultimately denied in the 2022 PPA Denial; and the Hawaiʻ i Supreme 
Court affirmed the 2022 PPA Denial in 2023 in HELCO III. 
On April 29 and May 7, 2024, Defendants-Appellees 
County of Hawaiʻi Windward Planning Commission, County of Hawaiʻ i 
Planning Department (collectively, the County), and Hu Honua 
filed their responses stating that they agreed this appeal is moot for the reasons set forth in the OSC. Also on May 7, 2024,

  Hawaiʻi appellate courts have recognized three 
exceptions to the mootness doctrine: 
(1) capable of repetition, 
yet evading review (CRER); (2) public interest; and 
(3)
collateral consequences. US Bank Nat'l Assoc. as Tr. for
Citigroup Mortg. Loan Tr. Inc. Mortg.-backed Notes, Series 2005-11 v. Greenberg, No. CAAP-19-0000065, 2023 WL 7104851, at *4 (Haw. App. Oct. 27, 2023) (SDO) (citing Hamilton ex rel. Lethem 
v. Lethem, 119 Hawaiʻ i 1, 5-10, 193 P.3d 839, 843-48 (2008);
  
Carmichael v. Bd. of Land & Nat. Res., 150 3
Hawai‘i 547, 560, 506 
P.3d 211, 224 (2022). 
  With regard to the CRER exception, the supreme court 
has explained that:

Rohr filed a response and argued the case is not moot because 
two exceptions to the mootness doctrine applied. 
The phrase, " capable of repetition, yet evading review," 
means that a court will not dismiss a case on the grounds 
of mootness where a challenged governmental action would 
evade full review because the passage of time would prevent 
any single plaintiff from remaining subject to the 
restriction complained of for the period necessary to complete the lawsuit. 
Lethem, 119 Hawaiʻ i at 5, 193 P.3d at 843 (cleaned up). Rohr 
argues that this matter is "capable of repetition" because Hu 
Honua will eventually pursue "a new contract with HE[L]CO for the same biomass power plant." Here, assuming arguendo a new PPA may be pursued in the future and the matter is thus "capable 
3 The Hawai‘ i Supreme Court adopted the third exception for 
"collateral consequences" in Lethem, to allow appellate review of a ninety-
day temporary restraining order (TRO), recognizing that a TRO "by its very 
nature" would "always evade review . . . ." 119 Hawai‘ i at 6, 193 P.3d at 844. 
The Lethem court applied the collateral consequences exception because "there 
[wa]s a reasonable possibility that the family court's issuance of the 
[(minor's)] TRO against Father [would] cause harm to Father's reputation . . 
. ." Id. at 12, 193 P.3d at 850.

of repetition," it would not "evade full review . . . ." A PPA 
is not subject to a time restriction or expiration that would 
prevent such review, unlike the TRO in Lethem. See id. at 6, 
193 P.3d at 844. We conclude the CRER exception to the mootness doctrine does not apply. 
"When analyzing the public interest exception, this 
court looks to (1) the public or private nature of the question presented, (2) the desirability of an authoritative determination for future guidance of public officers, and (3) the likelihood of future recurrence of the question." Id. at 6-
7, 193 P.3d at 844-45 (cleaned up). Rohr argues that the matter is "of great public concern," and a decision is needed to "advise public officials" on whether an environmental assessment 
is required when reviewing applications for PPAs. Here, the 
issue on appeal concerned whether the 2017 PPA Approval was an "action" triggering HEPA review, and HEPA compliance is a matter of public concern. HELCO I, however, vacated the 2017 PPA 
Approval, rendering it a nullity. See HELCO III
, 152 Hawaiʻi at 
354, 526 P.3d at 331 (reaffirming that the supreme court vacated the 2017 PPA Approval in 
HELCO I); Tri-S Corp. v. W. World Ins.
Co.
, 110 Hawaiʻi 473, 497, 135 P.3d 82, 106 (2006) ("The vacated 
order below is thus a nullity, and any error contained therein is now without effect." (citation omitted)). We conclude that "an authoritative determination for future guidance of public 
officers" on the applicability of HEPA to a vacated order that 
is a nullity is neither practical nor desirable. 
See Tri-S
Corp.
, 110 Hawai‘i at 497, 135 P.3d at 106; 
Lethem
, 119 Hawaiʻi at 
6-7, 193 P.3d at 844-45 (citation omitted). Thus, the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine does not apply.

   For the foregoing reasons, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that 
this appeal is dismissed.
