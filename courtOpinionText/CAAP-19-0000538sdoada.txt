ELESTHER CALIPJO, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v. 
JACK PURDY, REGAL CAPITAL CORPORATION,
REGAL CAPITAL COMPANY, LLC, Defendants-Appellants  
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 04-1-0003) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka and McCullen, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Jack Purdy (
Purdy) appeals from the 
post-judgment Order Denying Defendants' Motion: (1) to Enforce 
April 23, 2019 Supreme Court Opinion and December 22, 2017 Intermediate Court of Appeals Decision on Remand, (2) for Order Directing Calipjo to Disgorge to Purdy All Monies He Paid in Satisfaction of the Underlying Judgment Against Him Personally with Applicable Interest, (3) for Reconsideration of Order Granting in Part Plaintiff Elesther Calipjo's Motion for Attorneys' Fees and Costs Pursuant to [Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)] Chapter 480, and (4) for Taxation of Attorneys' Fees and 
Costs Filed May 27, 2017 (Order Denying Motion to Enforce)  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
entered by the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit (Circuit Court) 
on July 9, 2019.1 
Purdy raises a single point of error, contending that 
the Circuit Court erred by not granting Purdy's May 29, 2019 
motion to enforce (Motion to Enforce). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve Purdy's point of error as follows: 
The Circuit Court denied the Motion to Enforce based on 
its understanding that the appellate courts did not intend for the Circuit Court to take any further action in this case. This is understandable. 
In main, the Hawai#i Supreme Court rejected this 
court's (the ICA's) rejection of the jury verdict finding that 
Purdy was the alter ego of Regal Corp. and Regal LLC. See 
Calipjo v. Purdy
, 144 Hawai#i 266, 282, 439 P.3d 218, 234 (2019) 
(Supreme Court Opinion); 
Calipjo v. Purdy, No. CAAP-14-0001305, 
2017 WL 6547461, at *4-*6 (Haw. App. Dec. 22, 2017) (SDO) (ICA Disposition). However, the supreme court affirmed in part the ICA Disposition, as well as vacated much of it. Here, we try to 
address the proper disposition of this case after the Supreme Court Opinion and whether Purdy may be entitled to, inter alia, some money back from Plaintiff-Appellee Elesther Calipjo (Calipjo).

First, it is well-established that appellate 
jurisdiction "ordinarily terminates upon the appellate court's 
filing its judgment on appeal." State v. Harrison, 95 Hawai# i 
28, 30, 18 P.3d 890, 892 (2001) (citing State v. Ortiz, 91 Hawai#i
 181, 197, 981 P.2d 1127, 1143 (1999)). "Once the 
appellate court files its judgment on appeal, the trial court reacquires jurisdiction." Id.; see also Korean Buddhist Dae Won Sa Temple of Haw. v. Concerned Citizens of Palolo, 107 Hawai# i 
371, 383-84, 114 P.3d 113, 125-26 (2005) (Korean Buddhist). In 
this case, the supreme court entered its judgment on May 21, 
2019. Thereafter, the Circuit Court reacquired jurisdiction for purposes of any post-judgment litigation. See Harrison, 95 Hawai#i at 30, 18 P.3d at 892; Korean Buddhist, 107 Hawai# i at 
383, 114 P.3d at 125. 
Next, we go back to the original Circuit Court 
proceedings. At trial, Calipjo sought relief against Purdy, Regal Corp., and Regal LLC for, inter a
lia, their alleged unfair 
and deceptive trade practices.2 The jury found that Purdy, Regal 
Corp., and Regal LLC engaged in unfair and deceptive trade practices and that Purdy was the alter ego of both Regal Corp. and Regal LLC. The Judgment stated, in pertinent part: 
2 The tenth claim for relief in the First Amended Complaint stated: 
TENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF 
(Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices) 
95. PURDY, REGAL CORP, and REGAL LLC are liable to
MR. CALIPJO for unfair trade practices and unfair
competition in violation of HRS §480-2 and §480-13, therebyentitling him to treble damages and attorneys' fees andcosts in an amount to be proved at trial.

with respect to Count 10 of the First Amended
Complaint (unfair and deceptive trade practices claim),
$166,865.00 against Defendant Jack Purdy, $166,875.00against Defendant Regal Capital Corporation, and $7,500.00against Defendant Regal Capital Company, LLC, plus statutoryinterest currently in the amount of ten percent (10%) perannum until paid in full; 
. . . . 
with respect to the monetary judgments entered against
both Regal Capital Corporation and Regal Capital Company,
LLC, Defendant Jack Purdy shall be joint and severallyliable. 
On appeal, the ICA concluded that there was no evidence 
that Purdy was the alter ego of Regal Corp., as there was no 
evidence that Regal Corp. failed to comply with the law or that it was used to abuse a third party. ICA Disposition, 2017 WL 6547461, at *3-*4. This conclusion was subsequently vacated. See Supreme Court Opinion, 144 Hawai# i at 282, 439 P.3d at 234. 
The ICA further concluded that the Circuit Court erred 
in refusing to enter judgment as a matter of law as to the unfair or deceptive trade practices against Purdy and Regal LLC. ICA Disposition, 2017 WL 6547461 at *4. Regarding Purdy, we reasoned that he was not a party to either Deposit Receipt Offer and Acceptance (DROA), and that HRS § 480-17 did not apply because 
Regal Corp.'s unfair or deceptive acts did not invoke any penal 
provisions of HRS chapter 480. Id. at *4-*6. As such, Regal Corp.'s unfair or deceptive acts were not deemed to also be the acts of Purdy. Id.
The supreme court stated that it considered on one 
issue: 
whether this Court erred in concluding "there was no
evidence to support the jury's verdict that (1) [Purdy] wasthe alter ego of [Regal Corp.] and [Regal LLC], (2) RegalCorp. breached the contracts it entered into with Calipjo,and (3) Regal LLC committed unfair and deceptive acts or
practices."

Supreme Court Opinion, 144 Hawai# i at 267-68, 439 P.3d at 220-
21. 3
The supreme court reinstated Purdy's liability as to 
Count 10 of the First Amended Complaint by concluding that there 
was evidence to support the jury's finding that he was the alter ego of both Regal Corp. and Regal LLC. Id. at 282, 439 P.3d at 234.
4 As repeatedly explained by the supreme court, alter ego 
liability is not a claim for substantive relief, rather, it allows an aggrieved party to expand the reach of a judgment to a second entity or person: 
This court has held that the alter ego doctrine does not
create a separate cause of action, but rather, creates ameans for an individual (the alter ego) to be heldpersonally liable for a cause of action against a corporateentity: 
A claim based on the alter ego theory is not in
itself a claim for substantive relief, but rather todisregard the corporation as a distinct defendant isprocedural. A finding of fact of alter ego, standingalone, creates no cause of action. It merelyfurnishes a means for a complainant to reach a secondcorporation or individual upon a cause of action thatotherwise would have existed only against the firstcorporation. An attempt to pierce the corporate veilis a means of imposing liability on an underlyingcause of action, such as a tort or breach of contract.The alter ego doctrine is thus remedial, notdefensive, in nature. One who seeks to disregard the 
3 The supreme court also vacated the ICA's holding that the Circuit
Court erred in determining that Regal LLC was not entitled to attorneys' fees.Supreme Court Opinion, 144 Hawai #i at 281 n.27, 439 P.3d at 233 n.27. 
4 In reinstating alter ego liability, the supreme court reasoned: 
The ICA's holding that no evidence supported the
jury's verdict that Regal Corp. breached the DROAs, RegalLLC engaged in unfair and deceptive acts or practices, andPurdy was the alter ego of Regal Corp. and Regal LLC waserror. Because evidence supported the jury's verdict that
Purdy is the alter ego, he is liable for breach of contract,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, andunfair and deceptive acts or practices. Accordingly, weaffirm in part and vacate in the part the January 24, 2018judgment of the ICA and reinstate the circuit court's July18, 2014 final judgment. 
Supreme Court Opinion, 144 Hawai #i at 282, 439 P.3d at 234 (emphasis added).

corporate veil must show that the corporate form has
been abused to the injury of a third person. 
Robert's Hawaii, 91 Hawai #i at 241, 982 P.2d at 870
(emphasis in original) (quoting 1 William Meade Fletcher etal., Fletcher Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations§ 41.10, at 568-81 (perm. ed. 1999)). Although Purdy was
not named as a party to the DROAs, the jury determined thathe functioned as the alter ego of Regal Corp. and Regal LLC.Because the jury found that Purdy was the alter ego of RegalCorp. and Regal LLC, Purdy was held liable for theunderlying claims. 
Id. (some citations and footnote omitted; bolded emphasis added). 
The supreme court did not, however, disturb our 
conclusion that Purdy was not directly liable because he was not 
a party to either DROA, and because HRS § 480-17(a) did not apply. See ICA Disposition, 2017 WL 6547461 at *4, *6. Rather, 
the supreme court held that this Court erred because we "erroneously overturned the jury's verdict regarding alter ego and reversed the judgment against Purdy for breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and unfair and deceptive acts or practices." Supreme Court Opinion
, 144 
Hawai#i at 282, 439 P.3d at 234. Accordingly, Purdy was liable 
as to Count 10 because he was alter ego of both Regal Corp. and Regal LLC. 
The confusion seemingly stems not from the supreme 
court's conclusions and reasoning in the 
Supreme Court Opinion, 
but rather in its directive to reinstate the Circuit Court's judgment. See id. On remand, or in this case upon the 
termination of appellate jurisdiction, "a trial court must closely adhere to the true intent and meaning of the appellate court's mandate." In re Haw. Elec. Light Co., Inc.
, 149 Hawai#i 
239, 241, 487 P.3d 708, 710 (2021) (
In re HELCO) (citing State v. 
Lincoln, 72 Haw. 480, 485, 825 P.2d 64, 68 (1992)). "The 'true 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
intent and meaning' of a reviewing court's mandate is not to be 
found in a solitary word or decontextualized phrase, but rather in the opinion, as a whole, read in conjunction with the judgment and interpreted in light of the cases's procedural history and context." Id. (citation omitted). 
Here, the true intent and meaning of the Supreme Court 
Opinion, read as a whole, is that alter ego liability made Purdy liable for the "corporate obligations" of Regal Corp. and Regal LLC. It did not create a separate cause of action against Purdy, "but rather, create[d] a means for [Purdy] (the alter ego) to be held personally liable for a cause of action" against Regal Corp. and Regal LLC. See Supreme Court Opinion, 144 
Hawai#i at 282, 
439 P.3d at 234. As the supreme court noted, Purdy was not a party to the DROAs, but "[b]ecause the jury found that Purdy was the alter ego of Regal Corp. and Regal LLC, Purdy was held liable for the underlying claims." Id. The supreme court did not intend to create or imply an independent cause of action against Purdy arising from his alter ego liability. 
In this light, we turn to the Order Denying Motion to 
Enforce. 
On January 6, 2015, Calipjo filed Plaintiff's Partial 
Satisfaction of Final Judgment, acknowledging receipt of $9,362.30 paid by Regal LLC. Calipjo also released his judgment lien against Regal LLC. On February 2, 2016, Calipjo filed a second Plaintiff's Partial Satisfaction of Final Judgment, acknowledging receipt of $406,379.90 paid by Purdy and Regal Corp. On May 10, 2016, Calipjo filed a Satisfaction and Release of Judgment, acknowledging that he had been paid in full. 
7  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In the Motion to Enforce and on this appeal, Purdy 
asserts that in light of the appellate courts opinions that 
followed the payments he made on the Circuit Court's judgment, he overpaid Calipjo; i.e., his personal liability was as the alter 
ego of the entities, not in addition to his alter ego liability. This argument is consistent with our reading of the ICA Disposition and the Supreme Court Opinion. Thus, to the extent that Purdy paid Calipjo in excess of the amounts due jointly and severally with the entities, we conclude that the Motion to Enforce should have been granted. 
Purdy further argues that he is entitled to the 
"statutory interest rate" on the amount he overpaid. However, Purdy cites no authority for this proposition and we conclude that it is without merit. In addition, Purdy argues he prevailed on all causes of action asserted against him and is thus entitled to costs and attorneys' fees pursuant to HRS §§ 607-9 (2016) and 607-14 (2016). This argument is without merit as the gravamen of the Supreme Court Opinion was that Purdy was personally liable as the alter ego of Regal Corp. and Regal LLC. 
For these reason, the Circuit Court's July 9, 2019 
Order Denying Motion to Enforce is vacated in part, so that the Circuit Court can determine the amount that Purdy paid Calipjo in excess of the amounts due jointly and severally with the entities, and this case is remanded to the Circuit Court to entertain any further proceedings consistent with this limited

relief. The Circuit Court's July 9, 2019 Order Denying Motion to 
Enforce is otherwise affirmed.
