On appeal, Char contends that: (1) the Circuit Court's 
jury instruction on the presumption of innocence and reasonable 
doubt, presented in lieu of Hawai# i Pattern Jury Instructions 
Criminal (
HAWJIC) 3.02, "was prejudicially insufficient, thus 
denying Char his constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial"; and (2) the State committed prosecutorial misconduct during its rebuttal closing argument when the Deputy Prosecuting Attorney (DPA) posed questions that "clearly and improperly 
appealed to the jury's sympathy." 
After reviewing the record on appeal and the relevant 
legal authorities, and giving due consideration to the issues 
raised and the arguments advanced by the parties, we affirm the Judgment for the reasons set forth below. 
I. Background 
On August 1, 2016, Char was involved in a physical 
altercation along the H-1 freeway following a traffic incident. He was charged with Attempted Murder in the Second Degree as to Complainant Jesther Marlang (Marlang
), Assault in the Second 
Degree as to Complainant Deion Anunciacion (Anunciacion), and 
Assault in the Third Degree as to Complainant Jene Winn (Winn). 
At trial, the State alleged that during the altercation, Char: 
(1) stabbed Marlang five times, to his abdomen and the side of his body, and sliced the back of Marlang's neck and forearm; (2) stabbed one and sliced the other of Anunciacion's forearms; and (3) sliced two of Winn's fingers. Char claimed he was defending himself against two younger men, Marlang and Anunciacion, who were attacking him. 
On March 1, 2019, the jury found Char guilty as charged 
on all three counts. This appeal followed. 
/ (...continued)
(a) Intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causes
bodily injury to another person; or 
(b) Negligently causes bodily injury to anotherperson with a dangerous instrument.

II. Discussion 
A. Jury Instruction 
Char argues that the Circuit Court erred in 
substituting its own jury instruction on the presumption of
innocence and reasonable doubt for HAWJIC 3.02.  
HAWJIC 3.02 states: 
3.02 PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE; REASONABLE DOUBT 
You must presume the defendant is innocent of the
charge against him/her. 
This presumption remains with the
defendant throughout the trial of the case, unless and until
the prosecution proves the defendant guilty beyond areasonable doubt. 
The presumption of innocence is not a mere slogan but
an essential part of the law that is binding upon you. It places upon the prosecution the duty of proving everymaterial element of the offense charged against thedefendant beyond a reasonable doubt. 
You must not find the defendant guilty upon mere
suspicion or upon evidence which only shows that thedefendant is probably guilty. What the law requires beforethe defendant can be found guilty is not suspicion, notprobabilities, but proof of the defendant's guilt beyond areasonable doubt. 
What is a reasonable doubt? 
It is a doubt in your mind about the defendant's guilt
which arises from the evidence presented or from the lack of
evidence and which is based upon reason and common sense. 
Each of you must decide, individually, whether there
is or is not such a doubt in your mind after careful andimpartial consideration of the evidence. 
Be mindful, however, that a doubt which has no basis
in the evidence presented, or the lack of evidence, orreasonable inferences therefrom, or a doubt which is basedupon imagination, suspicion or mere speculation or guessworkis not a reasonable doubt. 
What is proof beyond a reasonable doubt? 
If, after consideration of the evidence and the law,
you have a reasonable doubt of the defendant's guilt, then
the prosecution has not proved the defendant's guilt beyonda reasonable doubt and it is your duty to find the defendantnot guilty. 
If, after consideration of the evidence and the law,
you do not have a reasonable doubt of the defendant's guilt,then the prosecution has proved the defendant's guilt beyonda reasonable doubt and it is your duty to find the defendantguilty. 
In lieu of HAWJIC 3.02, the Circuit Court instructed 
the jury as follows: 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
It is a cardinal principle of our system of justice
that a person accused of a crime is presumed not to have
committed the crime. Mark Char is presumed innocent unlessyou conclude that his guilt has been established beyond areasonable doubt. 
The presumption of innocence requires the prosecution
to prove every element of the offenses charged against MarkChar beyond a reasonable doubt. He does not have to proveanything. 
The phrase reasonable doubt does not have a technical
or complicated meaning. A reasonable doubt is exactly whatit is -- a doubt that is reasonable. You must use yourcommon sense and the rational faculties and logicalprocesses of your mind to determine whether you have a doubtthat is reasonable. Be mindful that not all doubts are reasonable doubts. A doubt based upon imagination, or merespeculation or guesswork is not a reasonable doubt. 
A reasonable doubt is a doubt based on your reason and
common sense. It arises from the evidence, or a lack ofevidence, or the reasonable inferences that emerge. Throughreason you must decide whether your mind is free or not freeof a reasonable doubt. 
Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is a very high
standard for the prosecution to satisfy. However, theprosecution's heavy burden does not mean it must prove theelements of a crime beyond all possible doubt or to anabsolute certainty. You must not base your decision on theproposition that anything is possible or nothing is certain. 
If, after fair and impartial consideration of all the
evidence and the law, you do not have a reasonable doubt ofMark Char's guilt, then the prosecution has proved his guiltbeyond a reasonable doubt and it is your duty to find MarkChar guilty. 
On the other hand, if, after fair and impartial
consideration of all the evidence and the law, you have areasonable doubt of Mark Char's guilt, then the prosecutionhas not proved his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and it isyour duty to find Mark Char not guilty. 
Char first contends that the Circuit Court's 
instruction was prejudicially deficient because it omitted the 
following statement contained in HAWJIC 3.02: "The presumption of innocence is not a mere slogan but an essential part of the law that is binding upon you." Char argues that this statement "highlights that the presumption of innocence is not a phrase to be taken lightly and/or ignored" and was thus "an essential precept that should have been provided to the jury." 
The United States Supreme Court has explained that "the 
Constitution does not require that any particular form of words be used in advising the jury of the government's burden of 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
proof[,]" so long as "taken as a whole, the instructions . . . 
correctly convey the concept of reasonable doubt to the jury." Victor v. Nebraska, 511 U.S. 1, 5 (1994) (brackets omitted) (quoting Holland v. United States, 348 U.S. 121, 140 (1954)). Likewise, the Hawai# i Supreme Court has stated: "It is well 
settled that jury instructions are to be viewed as a whole." State v. Sawyer, 88 Hawai# i 325, 335, 966 P.2d 637, 647 (1998) 
(citing State v. Cullen, 86 Hawai# i 1, 8, 946 P.2d 955, 962 
(1997)). 
The court also has made clear that "the duty to 
properly instruct the jury lies with the trial court," State v. Nichols, 111 Hawai# i 327, 335, 141 P.3d 974, 982 (2006), and 
deviation from HAWJIC "does not automatically result in incomplete and confusing jury instructions." Sawyer, 88 Hawai# i 
at 335, 966 P.2d at 647 (rejecting the defendant's argument that "deviation from HAWJIC is prejudicial
 per se" and noting "[t]he 
introduction to the instructions clearly states that 'nothing herein shall be construed as an approval by the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai# i of the substance of any of said 
instructions.'" (brackets omitted) (quoting HAWJIC (1991))). 
Here, the Circuit Court explained its use of 
alternative instructions in lieu of HAWJIC, as follows: 
I have modified or revised the Hawaii standard jury
instructions. In my view a lot of the standard jury
instructions are stale. They are unhelpful phrases,misleading comparisons. There's a lack of consolidation,there's redundancy. So I have attempted to craft juryinstructions that are more easily understandable to the jurythat will better aid the jury in their understanding of thelaw. 
Viewing the Circuit Court's instructions as a whole, we 
conclude that they correctly conveyed the concepts of the 
presumption of innocence and reasonable doubt, and sufficiently conveyed the importance of these concepts. See Sawyer, 88 
Hawai# i at 335, 966 P.2d at 647. For example, the instruction at 
issue included the following language: 
"It is a cardinal 
principle of our system of justice that a person accused of a crime is presumed not to have committed the crime. Mark Char is presumed innocent unless you conclude that his guilt has been established beyond a reasonable doubt." Additionally, the court 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
  instructed the jurors: "The presumption of innocence requires 
the prosecution to prove every element of the offenses charged against Mark Char beyond a reasonable doubt. He does not have to prove anything." Likewise, the court instructed:  "Proof beyond 
a reasonable doubt is a very high standard for the prosecution to 
satisfy." Viewed as a whole, the court's instructions were not "prejudicially insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent, or misleading." State v. Matuu, 144 Hawai# i 510, 516, 445 P.3d 91, 
97 (2019) (quoting State v. Kassebeer, 118 Hawai# i 493, 504, 193 
P.3d 409, 420 (2008)). 
Char next contends that the challenged instruction was 
misleading because, in its last two sentences, the "'guilty' instruction comes before the 'not guilty' instruction." Char notes that in contrast, HAWJIC 3.2 "gives the 'not guilty" instruction before the 'guilty instruction.'" Char argues that by "[p]lacing the 'guilty' instruction first," the challenged instruction is "subliminally misleading and leans towards the presumption of guilt and not the presumption of innocence." 
Char does not cite any Hawai# i authority to support his 
argument, and we have found none. 
We note, however, that a 
number of courts in other jurisdictions have rejected similar claims regarding the order in which "guilty" and "not guilty" have appeared on verdict forms. See, 
e.g., Rowland v. State, 829 
S.E.2d 81, 89 (Ga. 2019) ("Nor did the order in which 'guilty' and 'not guilty' were listed on the verdict form, when viewed in light of the rest of the court's instructions, mislead the jury."); Commonwealth v. Pi Delta Psi, Inc., 211 A.3d 875, 888 Pa. Super.), appeal denied, 221 A.3d 644 (Pa. 2019) (concluding that a verdict slip that listed "Guilty" before "Not Guilty" "did not infringe upon the [defendant's] right of presumed innocence" and, thus, "no Due Process violation occurred, and no appellate relief is due"); State v. Hayes, 462 P.3d 1195, 1207 (Kan. Ct. App. 2020) ("The district court did not err by placing the guilty option above the not guilty option in the verdict form given to the jury."). 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
 Here, after fully explaining the presumption of 
innocence and the concept of reasonable doubt, the Circuit Court 
articulated the circumstances under which the jury had a duty to find Char "guilty," and those under which it had a duty to find him "not guilty." Viewing the instructions as a whole, we conclude that the order of the last two sentences of the challenged instruction was not "prejudicially insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent, or misleading," Matuu, 144 Hawai# i at 
519, 445 P.3d at 100; nor did the instructions result in "a reasonable possibility that error might have contributed to conviction." 
State v. Pond, 118 Hawai# i 452, 462, 193 P.3d 368, 
378 (2008). 
B. Prosecutorial Misconduct 
At trial, toward the end of the State's rebuttal
argument, the DPA stated:  
You also know it's not self defense because Judy Char
does not get out of the red Camaro. What spouse, if they're
seeing their spouse or loved one being beaten by two men,isn't going to get out and try to do something? Get out andplead with the attackers to stop, honk the horn, get out,try to flag by some motorists, flag down some motorists. 
Or how about she just pulls her cell phone out and
calls 911, because the defendant said she had a cell phoneto call 911. That makes absolutely no sense, that he's beingso -- he's beaten so badly that he's got to pull out a knifeand maim these men, but she doesn't call 911. It makesabsolutely no sense. 
There's two types of people in this case. You have
those folks who did nothing. Judy Char. You have other folkswho did something. You have a nurse practitioner who barehanded plugged Jesther's hole where his kidney had beensliced off. You had a military man take off his uniform andwrap it around Jesther's injury. You have Kaohu Detwilertrying to desperately keep Jesther from bleeding out on thefreeway. Those are the two types of people involved in thiscase. 
And so, you know, when I'm hearing -- and when I'm
sitting there and I'm listening to defense counsel trying tothink, you know, what -- what can I say to these people?What is going to be the most persuasive thing I can say? ForJesther and Deion, what can I say for these boys? 
And then, you know what, I think I realize that
there's nothing I really can say, because what I have donein the time we've spent together is I've tried to recreateexactly what happened on August 1st, 2016 for you folks, inthis courtroom, with 14 witnesses. 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
So there's only really two questions left. Are you
going to stop and help these boys? Or are you going to just
pass on by? 
Thank you. 
Char contends that the questions, "Are you going to 
stop and help these boys? Or are you going to just pass on by?" 
constituted prosecutorial misconduct. He argues that these questions "appealed to the sympathy of the jury" and constituted "a request for them to use their conscience." 
When a defendant alleges prosecutorial misconduct, we 
decide: "(1) whether the conduct was improper; (2) if the conduct was improper, whether the misconduct was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt; and (3) if the misconduct was not harmless, whether the misconduct was so egregious as to bar reprosecution." State v. Udo, 145 Hawai# i 519, 534-35, 454 P.3d 460, 475-76 
(2019) (citing State v. Maluia, 107 Hawai# i 20, 25-26, 108 P.3d 
974, 979-80 (2005)); see State v. Tuua, 125 Hawai# i 10, 14, 250 
P.3d 273, 277 (2011) ("This court evaluates claims of improper statements by prosecutors by first determining whether the statements are improper, and then determining whether the misconduct is harmless." (citing State v. Kiakona, 110 Hawai# i 
450, 458, 134 P.3d 616, 624 (App. 2006)). 
Similarly, because 
Char did not object to the alleged misconduct during trial, "we must determine whether the prosecutor's comment[s] [were] improper and, if so, whether such misconduct constituted plain error that affected [Char's] substantial rights." State v. 
Clark, 83 Hawai# i 289, 304, 926 P.2d 194, 209 (1996) (citing 
State v. Marsh, 68 Haw. 659, 661, 728 P.2d 1301, 1302 (1986)); see State v. Wakisaka, 102 Hawai# i 504, 513, 78 P.3d 317, 326 
(2003); HRPP Rule 52(b). 
In evaluating whether a prosecutor's conduct was 
proper, we consider "the nature of the challenged conduct in relation to our criminal justice system generally and the special role of the prosecutor specifically." Udo, 145 Hawai# i at 535, 
454 P.3d at 476 (quoting State v. Underwood, 142 Hawai# i 317, 
325, 418 P.3d 658, 666 (2018)). 
The supreme court has stated: 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
[A] prosecutor, during closing argument, is permitted to
draw reasonable inferences from the evidence and wide latitude is allowed in discussing the evidence. It is alsowithin the bounds of legitimate argument for prosecutors tostate, discuss, and comment on the evidence as well as todraw all reasonable inferences from the evidence. 
Clark, 83 Hawai# i at 304, 926 P.2d at 209 (citations omitted). 
In determining whether a prosecutor's statements during closing 
were improper, we look at the statements in context, considering the argument in its entirety. See State v. Mars, 116 Hawai# i 
125, 142, 170 P.3d 861, 878 (App. 2007); see also State v. Bruce, 141 Hawai# i 397, 407-08 411 P.3d 300, 310-11 (2017)(concluding 
that, while viewed in a vacuum, the prosecutor's comments during closing argument could be viewed as improper, considered in context, the comments were not improper "because they did not detract from the main point of the otherwise meritorious argument" based on the evidence); State v. Pasene, 144 Hawai# i 
339, 369, 439 P.3d 864, 894 (2019) ("in context, the DPA's statements entreated the jury to use their life experiences to judge the credibility of the witness' testimony, rather than asking the jury to put themselves in the witnesses' position"). 
Here, viewed in isolation, the questions at issue can 
be construed as an appeal to the jury's sympathy. The questions, however, were not posed in isolation. Immediately prior to raising the questions, the State argued against Char's self-defense claim by highlighting the alleged inconsistencies between his testimony and his wife's alleged actions during the incident, and by contrasting those actions with those of the witnesses who stopped to render aid or who contacted the police. The State also referenced its attempt to recreate the incident for the jury through its fourteen witnesses. It was in this context that the State then posed the two questions at issue. Considering the argument in its entirety, we conclude that these questions were not a bald request for sympathy, but, rather, a rhetorical device to urge the jury to reject Char's self-defense claim and to return a guilty verdict based on the evidence presented at trial. In sum, the two questions at issue did not rise to the level of misconduct. See Bruce, 141 Hawai# i at 408 
411 P.3d at 311. 
10 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
 Having reached this conclusion, we need not determine 
whether the alleged misconduct was harmless beyond a reasonable 
doubt or so egregious as to bar reprosecution. See State v. 
Mara, 98 Hawai# i 1, 16, 41 P.3d 157, 172 (2002); State v. Roqan, 
91 Hawai# i 405, 423, 984 P.2d 1231, 1249 (1999). For the same 
reason, we do not reach the issue of plain error. See Clark, 83 
Hawai# i at 305, 926 P.2d at 210. 
III. Conclusion 
For these reasons, we affirm the Judgment of Conviction 
and Sentence, entered on July 1, 2019, in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit.
