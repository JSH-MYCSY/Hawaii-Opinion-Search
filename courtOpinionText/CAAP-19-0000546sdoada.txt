OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
WILSON K. KOIKE, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
WAI#ANAE  DIVISION 
(CASE NO. 1DTC-18-005830) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, and Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Wilson K. Koike (
Koike) appeals 
from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and 
Plea/Judgment, entered on July 5, 2019, in the District Court of the First Circuit, 
Wai#anae  Division (District Court).1/ Koike 
was convicted of one count of driving without a license, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 286-102 (Supp. 
2017). 
In the District Court, Koike moved to dismiss his case 
for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and improper venue, 
asserting that: (1) the District court lacked jurisdiction "because the Hawaiian Kingdom continues to exist as a sovereign nation-state" under illegal occupation; and (2) "the appropriate court with subject matter jurisdiction" is a military court established by the United States. The District Court denied the motions to dismiss. Koike entered a conditional guilty plea to 
1/  The Honorable Sherri-Ann L. Iha presided.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
driving without a license,2/ and the District Court sentenced him 
to, among other things, three days in jail, with credit for time 
served. 
On appeal, Koike contends that the District Court erred 
in denying his motions to dismiss and asserts the same arguments he made below. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve Koike's points of error as follows: 
In State v. Kaulia
, 128 Hawai# i 479, 486-87, 291 P.3d 
377, 384-85 (2013), the defendant argued that "the courts of the State of Hawai# i lacked subject matter jurisdiction over his 
criminal prosecution because the defense proved the existence of the Hawaiian Kingdom and the illegitimacy of the State of Hawai# i 
government." The Hawai# i Supreme Court rejected the defendant's 
claim and held as follows: 
Pursuant to HRS ยง 701-106 (1993), "the State's
criminal jurisdiction encompasses all areas within the
territorial boundaries of the State of Hawai #i." State v. 
Jim
, 105 Hawai #i 319, 330, 97 P.3d 395, 406 (App. 2004).
The State charged Kaulia based on his conduct in Kona,County and State of Hawai #i. Thus Kaulia is subject to the
State's criminal jurisdiction in this case. 
Kaulia appears to argue that he is immune from the
court's jurisdiction because of the legitimacy of theKingdom government. 
In that regard, we reaffirm that
"whatever may be said regarding the lawfulness" of itsorigins, "the State of 
Hawai #i is now, a lawful government."
State v. Fergerstrom
, 106 Hawai #i 43, 55, 101 P.3d 652, 664
(App. 2004), 
aff'd
, 106 Hawai #i 41, 101 P.3d 225 (2004).
Individuals claiming to be citizens of the Kingdom and notof the State are not exempt from application of the State'slaws. 
Id. at 487, 291 P.3d at 385 (footnote, ellipses, and brackets 
omitted). Here, Koike was cited for offenses in the City and County of Honolulu, and as in Kaulia, he is subject to the State's criminal jurisdiction. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of 
Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, entered on 
2/  The District Court dismissed a charge of driving without no-fault
insurance, in violation of HRS ยง 431:10C-104(a), pursuant to a plea agreement.
