NUIPITANE C. NAHALEA, also known as

APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
WAI
#ANAE DIVISION 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-18-00011) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Ginoza, C.J., and Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Nuipitane C. Nahalea, also known as 
Nuipitane Coen Nahale-A (Nahalea
), appeals from the August 2, 
2019 Amended Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and 
Plea/Judgment (Amended Judgment), entered in the District Court 
of the First Circuit, Wai# anae Division (District Court).   
Following a bench trial,  Nahalea was convicted of Operating a 
Vehicle under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII
), in 
violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1), (b)(2) (Supp. 2017).2/
  3/1/ 
1/ The Honorable Sherri L. Iha presided. 
2/ The Honorable Steven L. Hartley presided over the February 22,
2019 trial and entered the February 22, 2019 Notice of Entry of Judgment
and/or Order and Plea/Judgment ( Judgment ). 
3/ At the time of the alleged offense, HRS § 291E-61 provided, in
relevant part: 
Operating a vehicle under the influence of an
intoxicant.  (a) A person commits the offense of operating
a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if the personoperates or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle: NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
On appeal, Nahalea contends that the District Court 
erred in: (1) shifting the burden of proof to Nahalea; and (2) 
considering Nahalea's prior conviction for OVUII as propensity evidence. 
After reviewing the record on appeal and the relevant 
legal authorities, and giving due consideration to the issues raised and the arguments advanced by the parties, we resolve Nahalea's contentions as follows, and vacate and remand. 
Nahalea asserts in his second point of error that the 
District Court, in finding Nahalea guilty of OVUII, improperly relied upon his prior OVUII conviction as propensity evidence to prove that he was unable to guard against casualty at the time of the January 1, 2018 collision that led to the OVUII charge. We find this issue dispositive. 
We recently addressed a similar issue in State v. 
Ballesteros, CAAP-20-0000472, 2021 WL 2656684 (Haw. App. June 28, 2021). We summarized the relevant legal principles as follows: 
In State v. Ruggerio, the Hawai #i Supreme Court
addressed a dispute over whether the aggravating factors in
HRS § 291E-61(b) are elements of the offense that must becharged and proven to a trier of fact beyond a reasonabledoubt or are sentencing factors to be considered by thesentencing court. 114 Hawai #i 227, 237-38, 160 P.3d 703,
713-14 (2007), abrogated on other grounds by Christian v.State, 131 Hawai #i 153, 158, 315 P.3d 779, 784 (App. 2013),
overruled by Schwartz v. State, 136 Hawai #i 258, 361 P.3d
1161 (2015); see State v. Wagner, 139 Hawai #i 475, 484, 394
P.3d 705, 714 (2017) (distinguishing Ruggerio, butrecognizing its continued validity). The supreme courtconcluded that the aggravating factors in HRS § 291E-61(b)are not sentencing factors, and though not explicitly 
(1) While under the influence of alcohol in an amount sufficient to impair the person's normalmental faculties or ability to care for theperson and guard against casualty[.] 
. . . . 
(b) A person committing the offense of operating a
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant shall be sentenced without possibility of probation or suspension ofsentence as follows: 
. . . . 
(2) For an offense that occurs within five years ofa prior conviction for an offense under thissection or section 291E-4(a): 
[Applicable sentencing provisions].

categorizing them as "elements," nonetheless found them to
be "attendant circumstances that are intrinsic to and 'enmeshed' in the hierarchy of offenses that HRS § 291E–61as a whole describes," and that due process thereforerequires those factors to be alleged in the charginginstrument and proven beyond a reasonable doubt at trial.Ruggerio, 114 Hawai #i at 238, 160 P.3d at 714. Therefore,
the District Court did not err in considering evidence ofBallesteros's prior OVUII offenses in finding him guilty ofthe offense of OVUII 3, provided such evidence was onlyconsidered for the purpose prescribed in Ruggerio. 
Id. at *1 (emphasis added); see also State v. Murray, 116 Hawai# i 
3, 21, 169 P.3d 955, 973 (2007) (in a prosecution for abuse of a 
family member as a class C felony, evidence of the defendant's prior convictions could be used only to prove the prior convictions and was not otherwise to be considered by the jury in determining whether the defendant committed the charged offense). 
In Ballesteros, we concluded that the defendant failed 
to establish that the District Court had improperly considered the defendant's prior offenses as impermissible propensity evidence that he drove while impaired. Id. at *2. We reasoned: 
As to Ballesteros's contention that the District Court 
improperly considered the prior offenses as impermissible
propensity evidence that he drove while impaired, he pointsto nothing in the record supporting that conclusion otherthan that the District Court discussed the evidence of impairment and the evidence of prior OVUII offenses in thesame paragraph of the trial transcript. In that same paragraph, however, the District Court made the finding thatthe State had "proven beyond a reasonable doubt theviolation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) (b)(3)." (Emphasis added).
Therefore, the District Court was also addressing in thatparagraph the attendant circumstances applicable in thiscase. "[W]here a case is tried without a jury, it ispresumed that the presiding judge will have disregarded theincompetent evidence and relied upon that which wascompetent." State v. Kiese, 126 Hawai #i 494, 507, 273 P.3d
1180, 1193 (2012) (citations and internal quotation marksomitted). "This means that when evidence is admissible for a limited purpose, we presume that the judge only consideredthe evidence for the permissible purpose." State v. Lioen,
106 Hawai #i 123, 133, 102 P.3d 367, 377 (App. 2004).
Because the evidence of prior OVUII offenses is admissiblefor limited purposes here, this court must presume it wasonly considered for those purposes. 
While the presumption
is rebuttable, Ballesteros points to no evidence in therecord to rebut it. See Kiese, 126 Hawai #i at 507 n.7, 273
P.3d at 1193 n.7. 
Id. 
Here, in contrast, Nahalea points to the following 
findings by the District Court as evidence that the court 
improperly considered the defendant's prior offense as 
3   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
impermissible propensity evidence: 
THE COURT: . . . . 
. . . . 
The next question is whether or not you were
intoxicated to a degree, to a level, as argued by your
counsel, to be unable to guard against damage -- it's called"casualty" -- to yourself or to others. 
Okay. So that's 
the next step. And the court finds that even without the standard field sobriety test in this case and without anyother reasonable alternative explanations and given the factthat the incident resulted in a -- as everybody agrees, in ahorrible accident that could have killed people includingyourself, okay, the court takes it very seriously. Okay.And the fact that this is not a first offense, the courtalso in the totality of the circumstances must factor thatin. Okay. 
(Emphasis added.) 
Thus, the District Court explicitly considered "the 
fact that this is not a first offense" as part of the "totality 
of the circumstances" in determining that Nahalea operated a vehicle under the influence of alcohol in an amount sufficient to impair his ability to guard against casualty. And unlike Ballesteros, where the evidence of prior OVUII convictions was discussed in the same paragraph of the trial transcript as the finding of "[a] violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1)(b)(3)[,]" here, the court's reference to Nahalea's prior conviction was not part of a discussion of HRS § 291E-61(b)(2) or the attendant circumstance of such a conviction.
4/ Based on the District 
Court's statements in finding Nahalea guilty of OVUII, we conclude that Nahalea has rebutted the presumption that the court considered the prior offense for its permissible limited purpose, and instead considered it as impermissible propensity evidence. 
Morever, in light of the entire record, we cannot 
conclude that the District Court's error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See State v. Jones, 148 Hawai# i 152, 170, 468 
P.3d 166, 184 (2020). The District Court expressly identified 
4/ Rather, immediately after referring to "the fact that this is not
a first offense," the court stated: "And so based on all of that, Mr.
Nahalea, I do find that you were operating your vehicle -- and I find thisbeyond a reasonable doubt -- at the time under the influence of an intoxicantand that because of that, as evidenced by the accident itself, you were unableto guard against harm to yourself and to others given your condition at thetime." 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
only two facts – "the incident resulted in . . . a horrible 
accident" and "this is not a first offense" – in concluding that Nahalea was intoxicated in an amount sufficient to impair his ability to guard against casualty. On this record, we cannot conclude there was no reasonable possibility that the error might have contributed to Nahalea's conviction. See State v. McCrory, 
104 Hawai# i 203, 210, 87 P.3d 275, 282 (2004). Accordingly, the 
Judgment and the Amended Judgment must be set aside. See id. 
Given our disposition, we need not address Nahalea's 
first point of error. 
For the reasons discussed above, we vacate the 
February 22, 2019 Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment and the August 2, 2019 Amended Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, both entered in the District Court of the First Circuit, Wai# anae Division, and 
remand the case to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this Summary Disposition Order.
