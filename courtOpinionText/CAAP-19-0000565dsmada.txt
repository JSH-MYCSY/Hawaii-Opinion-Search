APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 16-1-0621(2)) 
ORDER GRANTING AUGUST 23, 2019 MOTION TO
DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By:  Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Chan, JJ.) 
Upon review of (1) the August 23, 2019 motion by 
Plaintiff-Appellee Anthony B. Aruda and Corinne S. Aruda in their 
capacities as the Successor Co-Trustees in and under that certain 
Alfred Aruda Revocable Living Trust Agreement Dated July 19, 
1976, Anthony B. Aruda and Corinne S. Aruda in their capacities 
as the Successor Co-Trustees in and under that certain Mary T. 
Aruda Revocable Living Trust Agreement Dated July 19, 1976, and 
Lisa R. Aruda Brown, Trustee under that certain unrecorded 
Lisa R. Aruda Brown Revocable Living Trust Dated December 3, 1991 
(the Arudas) to dismiss the appeal in CAAP-19-0000565 for lack of 
appellate jurisdiction, (2) the lack of any memorandum by 
Defendant-Appellant King Kamehameha VII, Ni#i Loa Moe~Kapu (Ni# i 
Loa Moe~Kapu), self-represented, in opposition to the Arudas' August 23, 2019 motion, and (3) the record, it appears that we 
lack appellate jurisdiction. 
Pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-1(a) 
(2016) and Rule 58 of the 
Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP), an aggrieved party may appeal from a civil circuit court case "only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and 
the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the 
appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]"  
Jenkins v. 
Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright
, 76 Hawai# i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 
1334, 1338 (1994).  "[A]n appeal from any judgment will be 
dismissed as premature if the judgment does not, 
on its face, 
either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." 
Id. (original emphasis). 
On April 11, 2018, the circuit court entered an order 
dismissing Ni#i Loa Moe~Kapu as a party from this case.  It 
appears that the circuit court reduced the April 11, 2018 dismissal order, as well as other dispositive orders, to an 
appealable final judgment by entering a June 27, 2018 HRCP 
Rule 54(b)-certified judgment (June 27, 2018 Judgment).  In the 
June 27, 2018 Judgment, the circuit court (1) entered judgment in 
favor of the Arudas' and against all of the multiple defendants 
as to Count 1 and Count 2 of second amended complaint, and 
(2)
 dismissed Count 4 of the second amended complaint.  No party 
timely appealed from the June 27, 2018 Judgment. 
Instead, on April 11, 2019, Ni#i Loa Moe~Kapu filed two 
non-conforming motions that appear to seek post-judgment relief 
under HRCP Rule 60(b) from the April 11, 2018 dismissal order.  
On April 22, 2019, the circuit court entered a post-judgment 
order that struck, and, in effect, denied Ni# i Loa Moe~Kapu's two 
April 11, 2019 motions for post-judgment relief, leaving nothing further for the circuit court to accomplish with respect to those 
motions.  "An order denying a motion for post-judgment relief 
under HRCP [Rule] 60(b) is an appealable final order under HRS 
ยง 641-1(a)."  
Ditto v. McCurdy
, 103 Hawai# i 153, 160, 80 P.3d 
974, 981 (2003) (citation omitted).  Therefore, the April 22, 2019 order was an appealable final post-judgment order pursuant 
to HRS ยง 641-1(a).  Ni# i Loa Moe~Kapu did not file his August 9, 
2019 notice of appeal within thirty days after entry of the April 22, 2019 order, as Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
(HRAP) Rule 4(a)(1) requires for a timely appeal.  The failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a civil matter is a 
jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot waive and the 
appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise of judicial 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
discretion.  Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127, 
1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Arudas' 
August 23, 2019 motion to dismiss is granted, and CAAP-19-0000565 
is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, October 18, 2019.
