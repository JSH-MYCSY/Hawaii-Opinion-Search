SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Pei 
Li filed this appeal without counsel. His notice 
of appeal was filed by the Hawai#i Labor and Industrial Relations 
Appeals Board ( LIRAB) on July 29, 2019. It appears he is 
appealing from the Decision and Order  entered by LIRAB on July 3, 
2019. 
Li's opening brief does not comply with Hawai#i Rules 
of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b). A self-represented litigant's 
pleadings should be interpreted liberally, and they should not automatically be foreclosed from appellate review because they do not comply with court rules. 
Erum v. Llego , 147 Hawai#i 368, 
380-81, 465 P.3d 815, 827-28 (2020). However, Li's brief has no statement of points of error and no argument. It consists of medical records and reports, with no explanation of why they are NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
material to this appeal, or why LIRAB's Decision and Order was 
clearly erroneous or wrong. 
We are not obligated to search the record for 
information that should have been provided by Li. Hawaii 
Ventures, LLC v. Otaka, Inc., 114 Hawai #i 438, 480, 164 P.3d 696, 
738 (2007) (first citing Lanai Co., Inc. v. Land Use Comm'n , 105 
Hawai#i 296, 309 n.31, 97 P.3d 372, 385 n.31 (2004) (explaining 
that an appellate court "is not obligated to sift through the voluminous record to verify an appellant's inadequately documented contentions" (citations omitted)); and then citing 
Miyamoto v. Lum , 104 Hawai #i 1, 11 n.14, 84 P.3d 509, 519 n.14 
(2004)). 
Accordingly, the Decision and Order entered by LIRAB on 
July 3, 2019, is affirmed.
