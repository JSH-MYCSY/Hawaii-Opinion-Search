A
PPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CASE NOS. 2PC-16-1001012, 2CPC-17-0000224,
2CPC-17-0000227, 2CPC-17-0000291, 2CPC-17-0000416,

OCTOBER 30, 2020 
GINOZA, CHIEF JUDGE, LEONARD AND HIRAOKA, JJ. 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY LEONARD, J. 
Hawai
#i law provides that convicted criminal defendants 
must pay certain fees, including a crime victim compensation 
(CVC
) fee and internet crimes against children (ICAC) fee, which 
help provide funding for certain criminal justice programs. See 
generally Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) chapters 351 (Crime 
Victim Compensation Act) and 846F (Internet Crimes Against 
Children Act, also known as Alicia's Law). However, the  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
pertinent statutes also provide, in varying terms, that these 
fees should not be ordered or should be waived if the defendant is unable to pay the fee. We analyze the language of these statutes and their application to the appellant, in light of the evidence in the record as to his financial circumstances, and we conclude that the trial court erred in imposing CVC fees and ICAC fees in this case. 
Defendant-Appellant Desmond C.K. Pulgados (Pulgados) 
appeals from the September 9, 2019 Amended Judgment of Conviction and Sentence (Amended Judgment) and challenges the July 16, 2019 
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law; Order Denying 
Defendant's Motion to Waive Court Fees and Motion to Reconsider Sentence (Order Denying Motion to Waive), which were entered by 
the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (Circuit Court).
1 
I. BACKGROUND FACTS 
Between December 2016 and March 2018, Pulgados was 
charged in six Felony Information and Non-Felony Complaints and 
one Indictment with 50 counts of, inter alia, credit card theft and fraud, forgery and identity theft, unauthorized property and vehicle entry, and various prohibited acts relating to drug paraphernalia and promotion. 
On November 23, 2018, the State of Hawai# i (the State) 
and Pulgados reached a plea agreement under which Pulgados pleaded no contest to the following sixteen charges: 
Count 1 
(Unauthorized Control of a Propelled Vehicle), Count 4 (Theft of 
1 The Honorable Rhonda I.L. Loo presided.

Credit Card), and Count 9 (Promoting a Dangerous Drug in the 
Third Degree) in Case 2PC161001012; Count 2 (Theft of Credit Card) and Count 3 (Fraudulent Use of Credit Card) in Case 2CPC-17-0000224; Count 1 (Theft of Credit Card) and Count 2 (Fraudulent Use of Credit Card) in Case 2CPC-17-0000227; Count 1 (Unauthorized Control of a Propelled Vehicle) in Case 2CPC-17-0000291; Count 2 (Promoting a Dangerous Drug in the Second Degree) and Count 3 (Prohibited Acts Relating to Drug Paraphernalia) in Case 2CPC-17-0000416; Count 2 (Unauthorized Entry into Motor Vehicle in the First Degree) and Count 3 (Theft of Credit Card) in Case 2CPC-17-0000610; and Count 1 (Theft in the Second Degree), Count 2 (Theft of Credit Card), Count 3 (Theft of Credit Card), and Count 4 (Theft of Credit Card) in Case 2CPC-18-0000179. 
At a March 20, 2019 sentencing hearing, the Circuit 
Court accepted Pulgados's no contest pleas and entered a Judgment; Conviction and Sentence; Notice of Entry (Judgment), 
convicting Pulgados and sentencing him to an indeterminate 
sentence, with a maximum term of ten years on the Class B felony count, to run concurrently with the sentences for the Class C felony and misdemeanor counts, which have maximum terms of five years and one year, respectively, as well as a fine for the drug paraphernalia count.
2 In the March 20, 2019 Judgment, the 
Circuit Court ordered Pulgados to pay: (1) CVC fees totaling $1,575.00 on fifteen counts; (2) ICAC fees totaling $1,500.00 on 
2 While the Circuit Court accepted Pulgados's no contest pleas, the
court did not adopt the parties' sentencing recommendation of "probation with
eighteen months jail and entry into the Maui Drug Court Program."

fifteen counts; (3) restitution in the amounts of $696.00 for 
Case No. 2PC161001012 and $210.99 for Case No. 2CPC-17-0000224; and (4) a court fine of $500.00 for Count 3 in Case No. 2CPC-17-0000416.
3 At the sentencing hearing, the Circuit Court denied 
Pulgados's request that he be found indigent and that any fees be waived, but granted his request to hold a hearing to further examine whether a waiver was warranted.
4 The court ordered 
payment of at least 25 percent of Pulgados's gross earnings while incarcerated, with payment thereafter at the rate of at least $30 per month, and with the $906.99 in restitution payable first. 
On March 22, 2019, Pulgados filed a Motion to Waive 
Court Fees. Pulgados argued, inter alia, that the fees "can only be imposed upon convicted defendants who can afford to pay them" and that, because Pulgados could not afford to pay them, the fees had to be waived. Pulgados further contended that there was a "presumption of indigency" based on his qualification for representation by the Office of the Public Defender. Pulgados argued that the presumption persisted through sentencing and that, here, it was not rebutted by the State. In addition, Pulgados argued that even if he is not found indigent, the CVC 
3 These figures reflect the amounts contained in the March 20, 2019
Judgment. Subsequently, the court struck one Class C felony conviction upon
finding that the State did not have probable cause to support the charge.Accordingly, the Amended Judgment of September 9, 2019, reflects acorresponding reduction of $105.00 in CVC fees and $100.00 in ICAC fees sothat the fee amounts at issue on appeal are $1,470.00 and $1,400.00,respectively. 
4 When prompted for a response to Pulgados's waiver request, the
State deferred to the court. 
4  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and ICAC fees are unconstitutional as "[t]hey are not fees at 
all, but taxes unconstitutionally delegated to the Judiciary."5 
At a June 3, 2019 evidentiary hearing on the Motion to 
Waive Court Fees, Pulgados argued that he could not afford to pay the CVC or ICAC fees.
6 Pulgados testified that he had no income, 
no savings, no checking account, no real property, no stocks, no bonds, nor any other assets of any kind. Pulgados testified that he had no expenses, was living at Halawa Correctional Facility, and had been incarcerated there for two years at that point, and that he had not held a job in at least four years. Pulgados also testified that his last job was as a shuttle driver, but he did not have a driver's license as of the hearing. 
When cross-examined about his ability to find 
employment upon his eventual release from prison, Pulgados testified that he could read and write English, completed the eleventh grade, and has a GED.
7 Pulgados also testified that he 
has "disability problems" relating to "ankle surgeries and back surgery" which took place in 2016. In response to the State's inquiry as to whether "there is any reason why you [Pulgados] 
5 Pulgados also argued that the fees constitute "an 'excessive fine'
in violation of the Hawai #i constitution and the Eighth Amendment to the
United States Constitution." 
However, this issue is not raised on appeal. 
6 Pulgados also asked the court to reconsider the ten-year prison
sentence. The Circuit Court denied that request, and the issue is not raised
on appeal. 
7 A GED refers to having passed a General Educational Development
test, which is a high school equivalency test. The Hawai #i State Department
of Education states that "[t]he GED test provides a valid means of measuringthe educational achievement of adults who have not graduated high school andof comparing their academic competence with that of high school graduates."

 wouldn't be able to get a job after you're released from prison", 
Pulgados stated that his ankle injury is "pretty serious" and causes him "to be like limited, like immobile." 
When asked about 
how the back surgery affects him, Pulgados stated that he cannot stand for very long or do heavy lifting, but that he would be able to work while sitting, and, upon inquiry, he confirmed that he had never filed any type of disability claim. 
Pulgados acknowledged that not all jobs would require 
standing, but claimed that he would not be able to return to work as a shuttle driver due to the injuries to his ankle. When further questioned about whether he would seek employment upon his release, Pulgados stated that it is "hard for a convict or a felon to get a job." However, he said that he is planning to try to find work when he gets out of prison and, if he could get a job, he might be able to pay $30 per month. Pulgados was 36 years old as of the June 3, 2019 hearing. 
On July 16, 2019, the Circuit Court entered the Order 
Denying Motion to Waive. The court found and concluded that 
"though Defendant has some medical issues, he is otherwise 
healthy, young, able-bodied, educated, and willing and able to find employment after release from custody." In addition, the court found that Pulgados "has the ability to become employed in the future; and, when he becomes employed, the minimum payment of $30.00 per month would be feasible." The Circuit Court therefore concluded that Pulgados "is willing and will eventually be able to pay the fees pursuant to HRS ยง 706-605(6)." In response to Pulgados's argument that the fees levied on him are 
6 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
unconstitutional delegations of the taxing power, the Circuit 
Court concluded that the statutes providing for the ICAC and CVC fees are constitutional and further concluded that Pulgados had not "satisfied his burden that no set of circumstances exists under which HRS ยงยง 351 and 846F would be valid." 
On August 15, 
2019, Pulgados filed a notice of appeal. 
On September 9, 2019, the Circuit Court entered the 
Amended Judgment, which convicted and found Pulgados guilty of fifteen charges, which were the same as the charges set forth in the March 20, 2019 Judgment, except that the Amended Judgment did not include a conviction for Count 1 (Theft in the Second Degree) in Case 2CPC-18-0000179. Therefore, there was no sentence of imprisonment, no CVC fees, and no ICAC fees related to that charge, and the total CVC fees levied against Pulgados were reduced (by $105.00) to $1,470.00 and the total ICAC fees were reduced (by $100.00) to $1,400.00. Like the Judgment, the Amended Judgment included a fine of $500.00 and restitution payments totaling $906.99. On September 25, 2019, Pulgados filed an amended notice of appeal. II. POINTS OF ERROR 
Pulgados asserts two points of error, contending that 
the Circuit Court erred: (1) in finding and concluding that Pulgados is able to pay the CVC fees and ICAC fees totaling $2,870.00, on top of restitution in the amount of $906.99 and a fine of $500.00; Pulgados points to Findings of Fact (FOFs) 13 
and Conclusions of Law (COLs) 6, 32, and 33 in his first point of error; and (2) when it levied $2,870.00 in fees from Pulgados 
7 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
pursuant to an unconstitutional delegation of the Legislature's 
taxing power and applied the wrong test in determining when charges are taxes or fees; Pulgados points to COLs 13-16, 18, and 20-21 in his second point of error. III. 
APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
We review the Circuit Court's findings of fact under 
the clearly erroneous standard. See, e.g., Peak Capital Grp. v. 
Perez, 141 Hawai# i 160, 172, 407 P.3d 116, 128 (2017) (citation 
and internal quotation marks omitted). 
"A finding of fact is 
clearly erroneous when 'the record lacks substantial evidence to support the finding,' or 'despite evidence to support the finding, the appellate court is left with a definite and firm conviction . . . that a mistake has been committed.'" Id. 
(quoting Beneficial Haw., Inc. v. Kida, 96 Hawai# i 289, 305, 30 
P.3d 895, 911 (2001)). 
The Circuit Court's COLs, including with 
regards to questions of statutory interpretation and constitutional law, are reviewed de novo, under the right/wrong standard. State v. Rauch, 94 Hawai# i 315, 323, 13 P.3d 324, 332 
(2000); Hawaii Nat'l Bank v. Cook, 100 Hawai# i 2, 7, 58 P.3d 60, 
65 (2002). 
"[T]he right/wrong standard . . . allows the 
appellate court to examine the facts and answer the question without being required to give any weight to the trial court's answer to it." State v. Russo, 141 Hawai# i 181, 189, 407 P.3d 
137, 145 (2017) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). "A conclusion of law that is supported by the trial court's findings of fact and that reflects an application of the correct rule of law will not be overturned." Dan v. State, 76 Hawai# i 
8 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
423, 428, 879 P.2d 528, 533 (1994) (citation and internal 
quotation marks omitted). 
"A judge has broad discretion in matters related to 
sentencing." State v. Phillips, 138 Hawai# i 321, 357, 382 P.3d 
133, 169 (2016) (citation omitted). 
Accordingly, a trial court's 
sentencing or resentencing determination will not be disturbed absent a "plain and manifest abuse of discretion in its decision." Rauch, 94 Hawai# i at 322, 13 P.3d at 331 (citations 
omitted). 
"The trial court abuses its discretion when it clearly 
exceeds the bounds of reason or disregards rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant." State v. Yamada, 108 Hawai# i 474, 478, 122 P.3d 254, 
258 (2005) (citation omitted). IV. DISCUSSION A. Denial of Pulgados's Request to Waive Fees Pulgados argues that the Circuit Court erred in finding 
and concluding that he is able to pay the CVC and ICAC fees, and in relying on his highly speculative future earning capacity in denying his motion to waive fees. Pulgados contends that the court's conclusion that he can pay $
2,870.00 in fees, on top of 
$1,406.99 for the restitution and fine, is not supported by the evidence and that the court was obligated to waive the fees, regardless of his potential to become employed upon release from prison at an uncertain point in the future, because he is clearly indigent. 
This requires us to examine the statutes directing the 
imposition of the subject fees. "The plain language of a statute 
9 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
is 'the fundamental starting point of statutory interpretation.'" 
State v. DeMello, 136 Hawai# i 193, 195, 361 P.3d 420, 422 (2015) 
(quoting State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai# i 383, 390, 219 P.3d 1170, 
1177 (2009)).

unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain and obvious meaning." Blaisdell v. Dep't of Pub. Safety, 113 Hawai# i 
315, 318-19, 151 P.3d 796, 799-800 (2007) (citation, internal brackets, and internal quotation marks omitted). 
"Where a 
statute is susceptible to more than one interpretation, the court will look to the intent of the legislature." State v. Johnson, 
68 Haw. 292, 296, 711 P.2d 1295, 1298 (1985) (citation omitted). 
1. HRS ยง 846F-3(a) (2014 & Supp. 2018) 
Pulgados was ordered to pay ICAC fees of $
1,400.00, 
which was $100.00 for each of his fourteen felony and misdemeanor convictions,
8 pursuant to HRS ยง 846F-3, which provides: 
ยง 846F-3 Internet crimes against children fee.  (a)
The court shall order every defendant to pay an internet
crimes against children fee of up to $100 for each felony ormisdemeanor conviction; provided that no fee shall beordered when the court determines that the defendant is unable to pay the fee. 
(b) When a defendant is also ordered to pay a fine,
make restitution, pay a crime victim compensation fee, orpay other fees in addition to the internet crimes againstchildren fee, payments by the defendant shall be made in theorder of priority established under section 706-651. 
(c) The defendant shall pay the internet crimes
against children fee to the clerk of the court. The fee shall be deposited with the director of finance who shalltransmit the fee to the internet crimes against childrenspecial fund pursuant to section 846F-4. 
(Emphasis added). 
8 Pulgados's fifteenth conviction was a violation, which is not
subject to either ICAC or CVC fees. As discussed in n.3 above, althoughPulgados was initially convicted of sixteen charges, the conviction on onecharge was struck by the Circuit Court, and the Amended Judgment includedconvictions on only fifteen charges. 
10 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRS ยง 846F-3(a) plainly and unambiguously states that 
"no fee shall be ordered when the court determines that the 
defendant is unable to pay the fee." 
The statute is written in 
the present tense, using mandatory language, and does not contain any language suggesting that a sentencing court has the discretion to order payment of ICAC fees even when a defendant is found to be unable to pay the fee at the time of sentencing. Upon review, nothing in the legislative history of HRS ยง 846F-3 evinces an intent for it to be read in any way other than its plain and obvious meaning. See S.B. 702, S.D. 2, H.D. 2, C.D. 1, 
27th Leg., Reg. Sess. (2014); S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 2818, in 2014 Senate Journal, at 1134; S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 388, in 2013 Senate Journal, at 1047; H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 956-14, in 2014 House Journal, at 1217-18; H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1104-14, in 2014 House Journal, at 1269; H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1548-14, in 2014 House Journal, at 1414; Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 88-14, in 2014 House Journal, at 1508, 2014 Senate Journal, at 726. 
Although HRS ยง 846F-3(a) itself does not define "unable 
to pay," it is well-established that indigency is the condition of being unable to pay. See generally Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 
U.S. 335 (1963) (using indigency interchangeably with terms such as in forma pauperis, without funds, poor); Arnold v. Higa, 61 Haw. 203, 600 P.2d 1383 (1979) (using indigent and unable to pay interchangeably). In evaluating whether a criminal defendant is indigent or nonindigent, in the contexts of obtaining appointed counsel and paying extradition costs, the Hawai# i Supreme Court 
11 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
has set forth several factors that a trial court ought to 
consider: 
(1) the defendant's income (gross income minus withholding
taxes, where applicable) from all sources; (2) thedefendant's fixed monthly expenditures, "especially thosewhich are reasonably necessary to provide him and hisdependents with the necessities of life"; (3) thedefendant's assets and investments; (4) the nature andextent of the defendant's fixed liabilities; (5) thedefendant's borrowing capacity and the extent to which suchborrowing would affect his or her fixed monthly obligationsand his or her future financial situation; (6) in certainlimited circumstances, the defendant's real property andpersonal property; and (7) other factors that may bear uponthe defendant's indigency. 
State v. Anzalone, 141 Hawai# i 445, 455-56, 412 P.3d 951, 961-62 
(2018) (citing, inter alia
, State v. Mickle, 56 Haw. 23, 26-28, 
525 P.2d 1108, 1111-12 (1974) (examining indigency in the context 
of eligibility for appointment of counsel)). 
"[O]ther factors" 
include whether the defendant has been represented by appointed counsel throughout the proceedings and whether the defendant has secured permanent housing. See id. at 456-57, 412 P.3d at 962-
63. 
In Anzalone, the defendant indicated at sentencing that 
she had secured employment at a hat store and could afford the $50.00 monthly payments for reimbursement of extradition costs assessed in her sentence. Id. at 456, 412 P.3d at 962. The 
Hawai# i Supreme Court nevertheless held that the record did not 
contain sufficient evidence to support a finding that the defendant was nonindigent. Id. Instead, the Anzalone court 
found that, despite the defendant's assertion at sentencing, there was no evidence presented, by either the defendant or the State, of the defendant's "financial circumstances" to "explicitly address whether she was nonindigent[.]" Id. The 
12 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
supreme court observed that such evidence could have included the 
amount of income earned from the job, "other sources of income and financial support (if any)" and "requisite expenses (e.g. housing and child-care)." Id. The supreme court concluded that 
"notwithstanding the fact that Anzalone may have secured a job at a hat store, Anzalone could still have been considered indigent at the time of sentencing" as she was represented by appointed counsel throughout the proceedings, had yet to secure permanent housing, and was still living at a shelter. Id. at 457, 412 P.3d 
at 963. The court thus determined that the evidence in the record was insufficient to demonstrate that the defendant was nonindigent at the time of sentencing. Id.

Here, the Circuit Court conducted an evidentiary 
hearing on Pulgados's assertion of indigency and based on his indigency, his request for a waiver of the ICAC fees assessed pursuant to HRS ยง 846F-3(a). Pulgados testified under oath at the hearing and presented no other witnesses. The State offered no witnesses and no evidence of any kind. Pulgados testified, inter alia, that his address was at the Halawa Correctional Facility, that he was unemployed, he was last employed in 2014, he had no income, no driver's license, no spouse, no savings account, no checking account, no home, no investments, no real estate, and no stocks/bonds/funds or other assets of any kind. 
9 In an earlier, unpublished decision, this court similarly held
that a trial court's reliance on the earnings that a defendant could earn in
prison constituted "an insufficient basis on which to find [the defendant]nonindigent" for the purpose of assessing extradition costs. State v. 
Phomphithack, CAAP-11-0000347, 2013 WL 3156024, *1 (Haw. App. June 21, 2013)(SDO) (citing Blaisdell, 113 Hawai #i at 319, 151 P.3d at 800 (defendant's
demonstrable prison income was insufficient, absent evidence of other income,
to deny in forma pauperis status regarding filing fees)). 
13 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
He also had no expenses or debts, except for the restitution and 
fine. 
There was no evidence of any kind regarding actual or 
potential prison income; as Pulgados had already been in prison for two years and his unchallenged testimony was that he had no current income, the record contains no evidentiary support for "prison income" as a source from which Pulgados could begin paying restitution, the ICAC and CVC fees, and the fine. The record reflects that Pulgados was represented by the Office of the Public Defender throughout these proceedings and that he would be incarcerated for an indeterminate period of up to ten years. 
The Circuit Court did not specifically determine 
whether Pulgados was unable to pay the ICAC fees at the time of sentencing, instead concluding that he "will eventually be able to pay the fees." We conclude that, with respect to the ICAC fees levied pursuant to HRS ยง 846F-3(a), the Circuit Court erred for two reasons. First, the Circuit Court did not make a ruling on whether Pulgados was unable to pay the ICAC fees at the time of sentencing, the determination that is plainly required pursuant to this statute. There is virtually no evidence in the record that Pulgados was able to pay the ICAC fees at the time of sentencing; there is overwhelming evidence in the record that Pulgados was unable to pay the ICAC fees at the time of sentencing. Second, even if the Circuit Court could have properly considered evidence of Pulgados's future earnings in its imposition of ICAC fees pursuant to HRS ยง 846F-3(a), the evidence as to Pulgados's age, his attainment of a GED, and his physical 
14 2. HRS ยงยง 706-605(6) (2014 & Supp. 2018)
and 351-62.6(a) (2015) FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 ability to engage in some form of work at some point in the 
future was insufficient to demonstrate that he would not remain indigent and unable to pay the ICAC fees. 
While Pulgados 
testified as to his willingness to work after prison, any finding or conclusion that he would in fact find sufficient work to support himself was purely speculative. 
For these reasons, we conclude that the Circuit Court 
erred in failing to determine that Pulgados was unable to pay the ICAC fees imposed on him pursuant to HRS ยง 846F-3(a). Accordingly, the Circuit Court erred in imposing the ICAC fees and denying Pulgados's request to waive the ICAC fees. 
Pulgados was also ordered to pay CVC fees of $1,470.00, 
which included varying amounts (ranging from $55.00 to $205.00) for each of his fourteen felony and misdemeanor convictions, pursuant to HRS ยงยง 706-605(6) & 351-62.6(a). HRS ยง 706-605 sets forth the statutorily authorized dispositions of convicted defendants in Hawai# i. HRS ยง 706-605(6) provides for a CVC fee, 
as follows: 
(6) The court shall impose a compensation fee upon
every person convicted of a criminal offense pursuant to
section 351-62.6; provided that the court shall waive theimposition of a compensation fee if it finds that thedefendant is unable to pay the compensation fee. When a defendant is ordered to make payments in addition to thecompensation fee, payments by the defendant shall be made inthe order of priority established in section 706-651. 
(Emphasis added) . 
HRS ยง 351-62.6 provides: 
ยง 351-62.6 Compensation fee.  (a) The court shall
impose a compensation fee upon every defendant who has beenconvicted or who has entered a plea under section 853-1 andwho is or will be able to pay the compensation fee. The 
15 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
amount of the compensation fee shall be commensurate with
the seriousness of the offense as follows: 
(1) Not less than $105 nor more than $505 for a felony;
(2) $55 for a misdemeanor; and
(3) $30 for a petty misdemeanor.
The compensation fee shall be separate from any fine thatmay be imposed under section 706-640 and shall be inaddition to any other disposition under this chapter;provided that the court shall waive the imposition of acompensation fee if the defendant is unable to pay thecompensation fee. Moneys from the compensation fees shallbe deposited into the crime victim compensation special fundunder section 351-62.5. 
(b) The criteria of section 706-641 may apply to
this section. In setting the amount of the compensation feeto be imposed, the court shall consider all relevantfactors, including but not limited to:
(1) The seriousness of the offense;
(2) The circumstances of the commission of the offense;
(3) The economic gain, if any, realized by thedefendant;
(4) The number of victims; and
(5) The defendant's earning capacity,including future earning capacity. 
(c) The compensation fee shall be considered a civil
judgment. 
(Emphasis added). 
Accordingly, HRS ยง 706-605(6) requires the imposition 
of a CVC fee on every person convicted of a criminal offense 
pursuant to HRS ยง 351-62.6, except in instances where the court finds that the defendant is unable to pay, in which case the court is required to waive the fee. Thusly, the statutory scheme for the imposition of CVC fees laid out in HRS ยง 351-62.6 is expressly incorporated into HRS ยง 706-605(6). In any case, statutes governing the same subject, in this case CVC fees, must be interpreted with reference to each other. See, e.g., HRS ยง 1-16 (2009);  Waters v. Nago, 148 Hawai# i 46, 61, 468 P.3d 60, 75

(2019) (statutory language must be read in the context of the 
entire statutory scheme and must be construed consistent with the purpose of the statute); Halstead v. Pratt, 14 Haw. 38, 39 (1902) ("The general rule is that a statute should be construed with reference to the system of laws of which it is a part, unless a contrary intention clearly appears."). Therefore, we must construe the "unable to pay" language in HRS ยง 706-605(6) in light of the language in HRS ยง 351-62.6 that states the Legislature's express intent to impose a CVC fine on a convicted defendant who "will be able to pay," even if the defendant is unable to pay at the time of sentencing.

Although both HRS ยง 351-62.6(a) and HRS ยง 706-605(6) 
were enacted in the same legislative act in 1998, there is no legislative history explaining the apparent inconsistency between the provisions. See S.B. 2966, 19
th Leg., Reg. Sess., 1998 Haw. 
Sess. Laws Act 206, ยงยง 2 and 4 at 717-20. There is also no explanation in the legislative history for why HRS ยง 351-62.6(a) contains both "is or will be able to pay" and "is unable to pay." The references to the imposition of fees in the committee reports are also in the present, "is unable to pay," language. See H. 
Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 894-98, in 1998 House Journal, at 1404; Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 123, in 1998 House Journal, at 1003, 1998 Senate Journal, at 796-97; Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 156, in 1998 House Journal, at 1025-26, 1998 Senate Journal, at 819. However, HRS ยง 351-62.6(b) also allows the sentencing court to consider

otherwise incorporated into the "[a]uthorized disposition of convicted
defendants" provisions set forth in HRS ยง 706-605.

the criteria for imposing fines under HRS ยง 706-641 (2014)12 
which contains the same "is or will be able to pay" language as HRS ยง 351-62.6(a), and directs the sentencing court to consider, inter alia, the defendant's future earning capacity. 
Based on the above, we conclude that a sentencing court 
must impose CVC fees upon the satisfaction of two conditions: (1) that the defendant has been convicted of a criminal offense, including a conviction upon a plea; and (2) a determination that the defendant is or will be able to pay the CVC fee. If it is determined that the defendant is unable to pay the CVC fee, then the sentencing court must waive the imposition of the CVC fee as stated in HRS ยง 351-62(a), as well as HRS ยง 706-605(6).

Obviously, Pulgados has been convicted of multiple 
criminal offenses and the Circuit Court made a determination, in COL 33 of the Order Denying Motion to Waive, that he "will eventually be able to pay" the CVC fees, as well as the ICAC fees. This conclusion is based on the Circuit Court's findings

ยง 706-641 
Criteria for imposing fines.  . . . 
. . . 
(3) The court shall not sentence a defendant to pay
a fine unless: 
(a) The defendant is or will be able to pay the
fine; and
(b) The fine will not prevent the defendant frommaking restitution to the victim of the offense. 
13 The Circuit Court cited State v. Martin, 103 Hawai #i 68, 79 P.3d
686 (App. 2003), to support its conclusion, for both the ICAC fees and CVCfees in this case, that the sentencing court should consider the defendant's
earning capacity, including future earning capacity. 
Although Martin touches
on the issue with respect to CVC fees (and restitution), 
Martin did not
address ICAC fees. More importantly, the trial court in Martin made no
express determination as to Martin's ability to pay and the case primarilyaddressed that the sentencing court itself must enter findings supporting anability-to-pay determination. Id. at 77-78, 86, 79 P.3d at 695-96, 704.

and conclusion in COLs 31 that, although Pulgados "has some 
medical issues, he is otherwise healthy, young, able-bodied, educated, and willing and able to find employment after release from custody," as well as the Circuit Court's further finding and conclusion in COLs 32 that Pulgados "has the ability to become employed in the future; and, when he becomes employed, the minimum payment of $30.00 per month would be feasible." 
As noted above in discussing the ICAC fees, we conclude 
that the evidence as to Pulgados's age, his attainment of a GED, and his physical ability and willingness to engage in some form of work at an indefinite point in the future was insufficient to demonstrate that he would not remain indigent, and unable to pay the CVC fees. 
The only evidence concerning prior gainful 
employment was Puglados's testimony that he had been a shuttle driver, which he is not physically able to do again. While there are conceivably pathways through which Pulgados could rehabilitate himself after prison and become sufficiently skilled in his early to mid-40s to be employed in some previously unexplored line of work (and this court hopes that turns out to be the case), there is no evidence in the record to support this conclusion. Nor is there any evidence that the level of income that Pulgados might be able to earn would be sufficient to render him "able to pay" in the future based on Pulgados's other financial circumstances; the only evidence in the record - no home, no savings, no assets of any kind โ paint a rather bleak picture of Pulgados's financial circumstances. The Circuit Court's conclusion that Pulgados will in fact find sufficient 
19 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
work to support himself and will be able to pay thousands of 
dollars of fees, on top of his restitution payments and fine, was purely speculative. 
For these reasons, we conclude that the Circuit Court 
erred in failing to determine that Pulgados was unable to pay the CVC fees imposed on him pursuant to HRS ยงยง 706-605(6) & 351-62.6. Accordingly, the Circuit Court erred in imposing the CVC fees and denying Pulgados's request to waive the CVC fees. 
B. Pulgados's Constitution Arguments The fundamental principles of judicial restraint and 
constitutional avoidance require that courts abstain from contemplating constitutional issues where such inquiry is unnecessary to dispose of the case at bar. Hawaii Gov't 
Employees Ass'n v. Lingle, 124 Hawai# i 197, 208, 239 P.3d 1, 12 
(2010) (citing the "fundamental and longstanding principle of judicial restraint requires that courts avoid reaching constitutional questions in advance of the necessity of deciding them") (citation omitted); see also State v. Delima, 78 Hawai# i 
343, 348 n. 7, 893 P.2d 194, 199 n. 7 (1995) (declining to address constitutional argument where statutory grounds were sufficient for disposition); State v. Domingo
, 69 Haw. 68, 70, 
733 P.2d 690, 692 (1987) (standing for same proposition). Thus, as was also noted by the Attorney General in her amicus brief, this court need not reach the constitutional issue raised by Pulgados if it finds that the Circuit Court erred in concluding that Pulgados is not eligible for waiver of court fees under HRS ยงยง 351-62.6(a), 706-605(6), and 846F-3(a). As that is the case 
20 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
here, we decline to reach Pulgados's constitutional challenges to 
these statutes. V. CONCLUSION 
For these reasons, we vacate in part the Amended 
Judgment, i.e., the imposition of the ICAC and CVC fees.  The 
Amended Judgment is otherwise affirmed. 
This case is remanded to 
the Circuit Court for such further proceeding as may be necessary to the entry of a further amended judgment consistent with this Opinion. 14
