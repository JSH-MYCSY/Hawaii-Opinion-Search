OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
PETER J.S. HIRAI, Appellant-Appellant, v.
 CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION, CITY AND COUNTY OF HONOLULU,
AND DEPARTMENT OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT,
CITY AND COUNTY OF HONOLULU, Appellees-Appellees 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 18-1-1151) 
ORDER DENYING STIPULATION TO WITHDRAW AND 
GRANTING THE STIPULATION TO DISMISS APPEAL 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of the Stipulation and Order to 
Withdraw as Counsel (Stipulation to Withdraw as Counsel) and the 
Stipulation and Order to Dismiss Appeal (Stipulation to Dismiss 
Appeal), both filed November 26, 2019, by Defendant-Appellant 
Peter J. S. Hirai (Hirai), the papers in support, and the record, 
it appears that: 
(1)
 In the Stipulation to Withdraw as Counsel, Hirai 
and his counsel, Ted H. S. Hong (Hong), stipulate to Hong 
withdrawing as counsel for Hirai and Hirai proceeding in the 
appeal self-represented; that, upon approval of the Stipulation 
to Withdraw as Counsel, Hirai will provide written notice to the 
appellate clerk of his contact information, including his mailing 
address, e-mail address, and telephone numbers; that Hirai will 
keep the appellate clerk informed of any change to his contact 
information; and Hong's representation in this case "shall 
terminate upon effective entry by this Court." The Stipulation NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to Withdraw as Counsel is dated and signed by Hirai and Hong; 
(2)
 The court construes the Stipulation to Withdraw as 
Counsel as seeking relief under Hawai# i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 50(a), which states: 
An attorney desiring to withdraw as counsel of record
must file a motion requesting leave therefor. The motion must show that notice of the motion was givenby service upon the attorney's client. The notice must provide, if available, the clientâ€™s physical andelectronic mail address to be used for service, andtelephone number. The appellate court may, in itsdiscretion, grant or deny such motion or, whereappropriate, remand the case for filing of a motion towithdraw. 
The Stipulation to Withdraw as Counsel does not provide Hirai's 
physical or email addresses for service, or telephone number. 
That Hirai may provide that information in the future does not 
comply with the rule. Accordingly, the court will not approve 
the Stipulation to Withdraw as Counsel without prejudice; 
(3)
 In the Stipulation to Dismiss Appeal, the parties 
stipulate to dismiss the appeal with prejudice and bear their own 
attorneys' fees and costs, under HRAP Rule 42(b). The 
Stipulation to Dismiss Appeal is dated and signed by Hirai and 
counsel for all parties appearing in the appeal, including Hong 
for Hirai; and 
(4) There appears to be good cause to approve the 
Stipulation to Dismiss Appeal. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Stipulation to 
Withdraw as Counsel is denied without prejudice. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Stipulation to Dismiss 
Appeal is granted and the appeal is dismissed with prejudice. 
The parties shall bear their own attorneys' fees and costs.

Honolulu, Hawai# i, August 26, 2020.
