APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 16-1-0532(3)) 
  
MEMORANDUM OPINION 
(By:  Leonard, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.)
 
Defendants-Appellants Christian Edward Duncan and 
Fatima Duncan (Duncans) appeal from the Circuit Court of the 
Second Circuit's July 26, 2019 (1) "Findings of Fact, 
Conclusions of Law and Order Granting [Plaintiff-Appellee Bank  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
2 
 of New York Mellon's (Bank of New York) ] Motion for Summary 
Judgment Against All Defendants and for Interlocutory Decree of 
Foreclosure," and (2) Judgment entered in favor of Bank of New 
York and against the Duncans.21
 
On appeal, the Duncans argue that the circuit court 
erred in granting summary judgment because (1) Bank of New York 
did not establish it had standing when it commenced the action, 
(2) Bank of New York did not establish foundation for the 
business records, and (3) Bank of New York's witness was not qualified to verify prior servicers' incorporation of records.  
The standing issue is dispositive; we vacate and remand. 
I. BACKGROUND 
On October 10, 2016, Bank of New York filed a 
complaint (Complaint), seeking to foreclose on the Duncans' real property in Lahaina, Maui (Property).  In the Complaint, Bank of 
New York averred that it "is the current holder of the Note with standing to prosecute the instant action and the right to 
foreclose the subject Mortgage" and Bank of New York's 
"foreclosure counsel is currently in rightful possession of the 
endorsed Note[.]"  Bank of New York did not include an original 
or photocopy of the Note with the Complaint.

 Over two years later, in January 2019, Bank of New 
York moved for summary judgment, averring that "no genuine issue 
of material fact exists and that [it] is entitled to judgment as 
a matter of law[.]"  In its memorandum supporting its motion, 
Bank of New York stated that "[a] true and correct copy of the 
Note is attached as Exhibit '1.'"  Bank of New York also stated 
that Exhibit 2 was "[a] true and correct copy of the bailee 
letter reflecting possession of the original Note, indorsed in 
blank, by [its] attorneys as of the filing date of the Complaint."  Bank of New York claimed that when the Complaint 
was filed on October 10, 2016, it "was entitled to enforce the 
Note, indorsed in blank, with standing to bring and prosecute 
this action." 
Attached to the motion was a declaration executed on 
November 27, 2018, by Elizabeth Gonzales (Gonzales), an 
"authorized signer of Carrington Mortgage Services, LLC, ('Carrington'), which is [Bank of New York's] servicing agent 
and attorney-in-fact for the subject loan . . ." (Gonzales 
Declaration).  Gonzales stated that Bank of New York "has 
possession of the Note with standing to prosecute the instant 
action and the right to foreclose the subject Mortgage.  The 
original Note has been indorsed in blank."  Gonzales further 
stated that Bank of New York "caused the original Note, indorsed NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
4 
 in blank, to be delivered to [its] attorneys, TMLF Hawaii LLLC, 
as agent for the" Bank of New York. 
Gonzales then stated that "Carrington's records 
indicate that [Bank of New York], by and through counsel, had 
possession of the original Note, indorsed in blank, prior to 
10/10/2016, the date of the filing of the Complaint for Mortgage 
Foreclosure in this matter."  Gonzales relied on the bailee 
letter, claiming it "reflect[s] possession of the original Note, 
indorsed in blank, by [Bank of New York's] attorneys" and noted it was attached as Exhibit 2. 
Exhibit 1 is a photocopy of the Note naming Full 
Spectrum Lending as the lender, with an indorsement from Full 
Spectrum Lending to Countrywide Home Loans and a blank 
indorsement from Countrywide Home Loans.  These indorsements are 
not dated. 
Exhibit 2 is the bailee letter from the Bank of New 
York's attorney to Ditech Financial LLC dated April 15, 2016, which was approximately six months prior to the filing of the 
Complaint.  The bailee letter stated, "We request the release of 
the following Collateral Documents checked below for the purpose 
of pursuing a foreclosure or legal action . . ." and the box for 
"Original . . . Note/Allonge(s) and POA as applicable" was 
checked. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

   During the hearing on Bank of New York's motion for 
summary judgment, counsel briefly discussed the bailee letter, 
but gave no specific explanation regarding how the bailee letter 
showed that Bank of New York possessed the original Note.  As to 
the Duncans' standing argument, Bank of New York did not respond 
except to rest on its pleadings.
 
The circuit court granted Bank of New York's motion 
for summary judgment and interlocutory decree of foreclosure, 
and entered findings of fact and conclusions of law.  The Duncans timely appealed.   
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW 
"We review a trial court's grant of summary judgment 
de novo."  State ex. rel. Shikada v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., 
152 Hawai‘ i 418, 439, 526 P.3d 395, 416 (2023) (citation 
omitted).  "To prevail, the moving party must demonstrate that 
there's no genuine dispute about the material facts and the 
'undisputed facts' show the court should grant summary judgment 
as a matter of law."  Id. at 442, 526 P.3d at 419.  "A court 
must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the 
non-moving party at summary judgment."  Id. (citation and 
internal quotation marks omitted). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 III. DISCUSSION 
Again, the Duncans argue, inter alia, that Bank of New 
York did not establish it had standing when it commenced this 
action.    
"A foreclosing plaintiff's burden to prove entitlement 
to enforce the note overlaps with the requirements of standing 
in foreclosure actions as standing is concerned with whether the 
parties have the right to bring suit."  Bank of Am., N.A. v. 
Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai‘ i 361, 367, 390 P.3d 1248, 1254 (2017) 
(cleaned up and citations omitted).  "Accordingly, in establishing standing, a foreclosing plaintiff must necessarily 
prove its entitlement to enforce the note as it is the default on the note that gives rise to the action."  Id. at 368, 390 
P.3d at 1255 (citing Hawaii Revised Statutes § 490:9-601 (2008)) (providing for a secured party's rights after default)).  Thus, 
"a foreclosing plaintiff must establish its standing to bring a 
lawsuit at the commencement of the proceeding, not merely at the 
summary judgment stage."  Deutsche Bank Nat'l Tr. Co. v. Yata, 
152 Hawai‘ i 322, 335, 526 P.3d 299, 312 (2023) (citations 
omitted). 
In its motion for summary judgment, Bank of New York 
claimed that it possessed the Note at the time the Complaint was 
filed and submitted the following to support its claim:  (1) the NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
7 
 Gonzales Declaration; (2) a photocopy of the Note; and (3) the 
bailee letter. 
The Gonzales Declaration stated that Bank of New York, 
through its counsel, possessed the Note "prior to 10/10/2016, 
the date of the filing of the Complaint . . . ."  Gonzales 
relied on the bailee letter stating, "A true and correct copy of 
the bailee letter reflecting possession of the original Note, 
indorsed in blank, by [Bank of New York's] attorneys is attached 
as Exhibit '2' . . . ." 
The bailee letter, however, did not establish that 
Bank of New York was in possession of the Note when the Complaint was filed.  Assuming, without deciding, that the 
bailee letter was admissible as evidence, it merely requested 
that the Note be sent to Bank of New York's attorney.  There was 
no language in the bailee letter confirming Bank of New York's 
attorney received, or was in possession of, the Note.  And although Bank of New York provided a photocopy of the Note, the 
blank indorsement was undated and the Note alone provided no 
indication that Bank of New York possessed it at the time the 
Complaint was filed. 
In short, Bank of New York did not establish that it 
was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  To the contrary, 
in viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the 
Duncans, there was a genuine issue as to whether Bank of New NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
8 
 York possessed the Note at the time the Complaint was filed.  
The circuit court, therefore, erred in granting Bank of New 
York's motion for summary judgment.  Accordingly, we need not 
address the Duncans' remaining issues.   
IV. CONCLUSION 
Based on the foregoing, we vacate the circuit court's 
July 26, 2019 "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting [Bank of New York's] Motion for Summary Judgment 
Against All Defendants and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure" and Judgment, and remand this case for further 
proceedings.
