Dkt. 90 SONOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Wells Fargo filed a complaint to foreclose Gilbert's
mortgage on April 27, 2018.  Wells Fargo moved for summaryjudgment.  The circuit court entered the Order and the Judgment. Gilbert appeals.  She argues: (1) Wells Fargo did not prove ithad standing to enforce her Note when its complaint was filed;
(2) Wells Fargo's business records were not authenticated; and
(3) Wells Fargo's foreclosure claim is barred by dismissal of anearlier lawsuit.
(1)A foreclosing plaintiff must show it had the right
to enforce the note when its complaint was filed.  Bank of Am.,
N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo , 139 Hawai #i 361, 368, 390 P.3d 1248, 1255
(2017).  Wells Fargo's attorney filed a declaration on August 15,2018.  He stated he received Gilbert's original promissory noteon February 22, 2018 (before the complaint was filed); he"personally reviewed the original endorsed [sic] Note"; and theblank indorsement is "on the reverse side of page 4 of the Note." Counsel's declaration was based on personal knowledge and showedthat Wells Fargo had the right to enforce Gilbert's note when itscomplaint was filed.
(2)Wells Fargo's motion for summary judgment was
supported by the declaration of Rebecca C. Wallace.  Wallace
worked for Nationstar  Mortgage LLC.  According to Wallace: the
original lender, Fremont Investment & Loan, assigned Gilbert's
mortgage to Wells Fargo; Nationstar serviced the loan for WellsFargo; the servicer before Nationstar was Bank of America ; and
Nationstar incorporated Bank of America's business records for
Gilbert's loan into its own business records.  Wallace'sdeclaration stated:
Before [Bank of America]'s records were incorporated into
Nationstar' [sic] own business records, it conducted anindependent check into [Bank of America]'s records and foundthem in keeping with industry wide loan servicing standardsand only integrated them into Nationstar' [sic] own businessrecords after finding [Bank of America]'s records were madeas part of a regularly conducted activity, met industrystandards and determined to be trustworthy.
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Wallace didn't describe what Nationstar did to verify
the trustworthiness of Bank of America's records, as required byWells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Behrendt
, 142 Hawai #i 37, 45-46, 414
P.3d 89, 97-98 (2018).  Compare  U.S. Bank Tr., N.A. v. Verhagen ,
149 Hawai #i 315, 325-27, 489 P.3d 419, 429-31 (2021) (discussing
"scant" and "nebulously described" circumstances indicatingtrustworthiness of incorporated records), with
 Deutsche Bank
Nat'l Tr. Co. v. Yata , 152 Hawai #i 322, 334-35, 526 P.3d 299,
311-12 (2023) (noting that third Behrendt  requirement wasn't
satisfied).  Wallace's declaration didn't establish admissibilityof the incorporated Bank of America records under Hawaii Rules ofEvidence Rule 803(b)(6) (2016).  Wells Fargo did not meet itsburden as movant under Verhagen
, 149 Hawai #i at 328 n.12, 489
P.3d at 432 n.12.  It did not prove Gilbert's default under theterms of the agreements or delivery of the notice of default. See
 Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Fong , 149 Hawai #i 249, 253, 488
P.3d 1228, 1232 (2021).  The circuit court erred by grantingWells Fargo's motion for summary judgment.
(3)Gilbert argues that Wells Fargo is "precluded"
from pursuing foreclosure because Wells Fargo's earlier lawsuit
against her was dismissed.  She doesn't specify whether claimpreclusion or issue preclusion should apply.  But it doesn'tmatter because she didn't provide the circuit court with WellsFargo's earlier complaint or any information about what claimswere asserted or what issues were presented in the previouslawsuit.  Her preclusion argument is without merit.
