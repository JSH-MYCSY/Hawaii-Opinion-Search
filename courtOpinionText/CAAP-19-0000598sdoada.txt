 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
entered by the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit ( circuit 
court) on July 25, 2019.1 
Pratt raises a single point of error on appeal. She 
contends that the circuit court erred when it entered the Order 
"because the cause of action (foreclosure) in this matter was 
precluded by res judicata ." 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we 
affirm. 
"Application of res judicata  is a question of law. 
Questions of law are reviewed de novo under the right/wrong 
standard." PennyMac Corp. v. Godinez, 148 Hawaiʻi 323, 327, 
474  P.3d 264, 268 (2020) (quoting Eastern Sav. Bank, FSB v. 
Esteban, 129 Hawai ʻi  154, 157, 296 P.3d 1062, 1065 (2013).  
In 2011, Plaintiff -Appellee First Hawaiian Bank ( FHB) 
filed a foreclosure action against Pratt, on grounds that Pratt 
had not complied with the terms of the original 2008 loan 
agreement. In 2013, FHB and Pratt entered into a Loan 
Modification Agreement, and agreed to a settlement. The circuit 
court dismissed the 2011 foreclosure action.2 The Loan 
1 The Honorable Robert D.S. Kim presided. 
2 Although the parties agreed that the 2011 action would be 
dismissed as a result of the Loan Modification Agreement, it appears that the 
parties did not stipulate or move to dismiss the 2011 action. The 2011 
(continued . . .)

Modification Agreement, among other things, reinstated the 2008 
loan, capitalized the past due amounts of over $134,000 as a 
deferred principal balance, and changed the maturity date of the 
loan to August 1, 2052. 
We conclude that the circuit court did not err in 
determining that the dismissal of the 2011 action did not have 
res judicata  effect on the instant 2015 foreclosure action 
brought by FHB against Pratt. In order for res judicata  to 
apply, the 2011 and 2015 actions must share an identical claim.   
"A party asserting res judicata has the burden of establishing: 
(1) there was a final judgment on the merits, (2) both parties are the same or in privity with the parties in the original 
suit, and (3) the claim decided in the original suit is 
identical with the one presented in the action in question ." 
PennyMac Corp., 148 
Hawaiʻi at 327, 474 P.3d at 268  (citing 
Bremer v. Weeks, 104 Hawaiʻ i 43, 54, 85 P.3d 150, 161 (2004)  
(emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted).  
The record reflects that the 2011 action which alleged 
Pratt's default on the original loan , and the instant action 
which alleges Pratt's default on the loan as modified by the 
Loan Modification Agreement , do not involve an identical claim. 
The Loan Modification Agreement was entered into pursuant to the 
2(. . . continued) 
action was dismissed for failure to file a pretrial statement, pursuant to 
Rules of the Circuit Court s of the State of Hawaiʻi Rule 12(q).

parties' agreement to settle the 2011 action and substantively 
modified the terms of the original loan agreement. FHB's claim 
in the instant 2015 foreclosure action alleging Pratt's 
noncompliance with the terms of the modified loan agreement 
therefore was not (and could not have been) "decided" in the 
2011 action. 
The circuit court did not err in concluding that res 
judicata did not bar the instant action. We affirm the Findings 
of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Denying Defendant Kiana 
Tristaca Pratt's Motion (1) to Set Aside All Orders and 
Judgments Pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b)(4), and (2) to Dismiss 
Complaint Pursuant to HRCP Rule 12(h)(3), Filed Herein on

Circuit on July 25, 2019 .
