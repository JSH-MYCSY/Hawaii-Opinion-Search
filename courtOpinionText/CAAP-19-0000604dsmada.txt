should not be dismissed for failure to participate in the appeal.

the order or to show good cause may result in sanctions,

1  The court takes judicial notice of bankruptcy court documents filed
here by Jenkins on January 30, 2020, as well as documents filed in the United
States Bankruptcy Court, District of Hawaii, in which the bankruptcy court
entered an order dismissing Jenkins' Chapter 7 bankruptcy case, No. 19-01233,
on October 25, 2019.  See Hawaii Rules of Evidence Rule 201.  It thus appears
that the bankruptcy stay has been terminated.  See 11 U.S.C. ยง 362(a)(1)
