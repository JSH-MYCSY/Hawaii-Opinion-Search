SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and McCullen, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant The Association of Apartment Owners 
of Kamaole Sands (AOAO) appeals from the July 31, 2019 Order 
Denying Defendant [AOAO]'s Motion to Dismiss Complaint Filed 
December 21, 2018, or, in the Alternative, Stay Lawsuit and 
Compel Arbitration (Order Denying Arbitration) entered by the 
Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (Circuit Court)  in favor of 1
1 The Honorable Rhonda I.L. Loo presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Plaintiffs-Appellees Doreen R. McKernan and Michael S. McKernan 
(McKernans). 
The AOAO raises a single point of error on appeal, 
contending that the Circuit Court erred in entering the Order 
Denying Arbitration, because Count I (Declaratory Relief), Count II (Breach of Fiduciary Duty and Other Common Law Duties), Count III (Breach of Contract, Breach of Governing Documents and Protective Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions), Count IV (Negligence), Count V (Specific Performance), Count VI (Injunction/Constructive Eviction), Count VII (Equitable Accounting), second Count VII (Violation of the Condominium Act), and Count VIII (Breach of the AOAO's Declaration) of the AOAO's First Amended Complaint for Damages and Declaratory Relief filed 
on April 18, 2019 (Complaint) are not exempt from arbitration 
pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 514B-162(b)(4) 
(2018), and should have been dismissed, or stayed and ordered to 
arbitration pursuant to Section 28 of the AOAO's Declaration and/or HRS § 514B-162(a) (2018). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve the AOAO's point of error as follows: 
The AOAO argues that the Circuit Court erred in 
entering the Order Denying Arbitration because the Complaint includes arbitrable claims for relief, along with a claim for 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
injunctive relief, which the AOAO acknowledges is exempt from 
arbitration. 
The parties agree that the AOAO and its members are 
subject to the AOAO's Declaration, as amended (Declaration), and 
Hawaii's Condominium Property Act, which is codified as HRS 
Chapter 514B. 
Section 28 of the Declaration provides: 
28. Arbitration of Disputes. As, and to the extent,
and in the manner, provided for in Part VII of Chapter
514A,[HRS], as amended, at the request of any party, anydispute concerning or involving one or more apartment ownersand the Association, Board of Directors, Managing Agent orone or more other apartment owners relating to theinterpretation, application or enforcement of theCondominium Property Act, this Declaration, the By-Laws orthe administrative rules and regulations adopted inaccordance with the By-laws shall be submitted to mediationand/or arbitration. The arbitration of appropriate disputesshall be conducted, unless otherwise agreed by the parties,in accordance with the rules adopted by the Real EstateCommission and the provisions of Chapter 658 [HRS]. {PartVII, HRS Chapter 514A} 
After HRS Chapter 514A was repealed and replaced with 
HRS Chapter 514B, effective July 1, 2005,  the Declaration was 2
amended in 2007 to include, 
inter alia, Section 29 of the 
Declaration, which provides in relevant part: 
29. Governing Law. Notwithstanding anything herein
or in the By-Laws to the contrary: 
1. This Project shall be governed by the provisionsof Hawaii Revised Statutes Chapter 514B, asamended to the fullest extent permitted bylaw[.] 
Thus, pursuant to the unambiguous language of the 
Declaration, as and to the extent provided in HRS Chapter 514B, 
at the request of any party, any dispute concerning or involving 
2 2004 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 164, § 2 at 796-98. 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the McKernans, who are apartment owners at Kamaole Sands, and the 
AOAO, relating to the interpretation, application or enforcement of the Condominium Property Act, the Declaration, the By-Laws or the administrative rules and regulations adopted in accordance with the By-laws must be submitted to mediation and/or arbitration. The AOAO relies on this arbitration provision and acknowledges that it is governed by HRS Chapter 514B. 
HRS § 514B-162(a) includes a mandatory arbitration 
provision: 
§ 514B-162 Arbitration . (a) At the request of any
party, any dispute concerning or involving one or more unit
owners and an association, its board, managing agent, or oneor more other unit owners relating to the interpretation,application, or enforcement of this chapter or theassociation's declaration, bylaws, or house rules adopted inaccordance with its bylaws shall be submitted toarbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted, unless
otherwise agreed by the parties, in accordance with the
rules adopted by the commission and of chapter 658A;provided that the rules of the arbitration serviceconducting the arbitration shall be used until thecommission adopts its rules; provided further that where anyarbitration rule conflicts with chapter 658A, chapter 658Ashall prevail; and provided further that notwithstanding anyrule to the contrary, the arbitrator shall conduct theproceedings in a manner which affords substantial justice toall parties[.] 
HRS § 514B-162(b) exempts certain disputes from 
arbitration, including: 
(b) Nothing in subsection (a) shall be interpreted to
mandate the arbitration of any dispute involving: 
. . . . 
(4) Actions seeking equitable relief involvingthreatened property damage or the healthor safety of unit owners or any otherperson[.] 
The dispute between the parties, as alleged in the 
Complaint, involves several incidents where the McKernans' 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
apartment was flooded with water and sewage, causing significant 
damage, and posing a health hazard to the McKernans and their guests. The Complaint alleges that wastewater pipes that serve more than one unit are common elements that must be fully investigated and repaired by the AOAO. As recognized by the AOAO, Count VI of the Complaint seeks equitable relief ordering that the AOAO take action and eliminate the continuing health hazard posed by the raw sewage backups. 
The AOAO does not dispute that Count VI falls within 
the scope of HRS § 514B-162(b)(4). Rather, the AOAO contends that all of the McKernans' other claims are arbitrable pursuant to HRS § 514B-162(a). The McKernans submit that, as concluded by the Circuit Court, pursuant to the plain language of HRS § 514B-162(b), the Complaint falls squarely within HRS § 514B-162(b)(4) and is therefore exempt from mandatory arbitration pursuant to HRS § 514B-162(a). The Order Denying Arbitration states, in part: 
. . . [The AOAO] argues that . . . [the Declaration]
and [HRS] Section 514B-162(a) unambiguously requires
arbitration. 
[The McKernans] do not dispute that Section 28 of [the
Declaration] provides an unequivocal mandatory disputeresolution process for disputes involving an owner and theAOAO relating to the interpretation, application orenforcement of the project's governing documents and HawaiiCondominium Property Act. 
[The McKernans] argue, however, that the dispute falls
under an exception to HRS Section 514B-162(b) and is notsubject to mandatory arbitration. HRS 514B-162(b) doesstate that nothing in subsection (a) shall be interpreted tomandate the arbitration of any dispute involving actionsseeking equitable relief involving threatened propertydamage or the health or safety of unit owners or any otherperson. 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Court finds that the instant complaint squarely
falls within the purview of HRS 514B-162(b), as it demands
equitable relief in the form of the order directing [theAOAO] to inspect and repair or replace defective portions ofthe plumbing system and alleges that the sewage leakscausing property damage and the threat of the health andsafety of the guests. 
Questions of statutory interpretation are questions of 
law to be reviewed de novo under the right/wrong standard. Ueoka 
v. Szymanski
, 107 Hawai# i 386, 392, 114 P.3d 892, 898 (2005). 
When construing a statute, our foremost obligation is to 
ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the language contained in the statute itself. 
Bhakta v. Cnty. of Maui
, 109 Hawai# i 198, 
208, 124 P.3d 943, 953 (2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Statutory construction is guided by the following well established principles: 
[O]ur foremost obligation is to ascertain and give effect to
the intention of the legislature, which is to be obtainedprimarily from the language contained in the statute itself.And we must read statutory language in the context of theentire statute and construe it in a manner consistent with its purpose. 
When there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or
indistinctiveness or uncertainty of an expression used in astatute, an ambiguity exists[.] 
Ueoka , 107 Hawai# i at 392-93, 114 P.3d at 898-99 (internal 
citation omitted). 
Here, the plain language of HRS § 514B-162(b)(4) is 
clear and unambiguous. 
Like HRS § 514B-162(b)(5) & (b)(7), 
(b)(4) exempts certain "actions" from the arbitration mandate in 
subsection (a) of the statute. In contrast, HRS §§ 514B-162(b)(6), exempts certain "claims" from mandatory arbitration. 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
See generally  HRS § 1-16 (2009) (laws in pari materia shall be 
construed with reference to each other). 
It is well-established 
in Hawai# i law, in a variety of contexts, that the term "action" 
is synonymous with an entire "suit," as opposed to a claim or 
claims, which might be prosecuted within an action or suit. See
, 
e.g., Leslie v. Estate of Tavares
, 93 Hawai# i 1, 4, 994 P.2d 
1047, 1050 (2000) (citations omitted) (discussing the definition of "action"); 
see also Rapozo v. Better Hearing of Haw., LLC
, 120 
Hawai# i 257, 260, 204 P.3d 476, 479 (2009) (applying 
Leslie 
definition to the term "action" in HRS § 481K-5(c) (Supp. 2007)); Nelson v. Univ. of Haw.
, 99 Hawai# i 262, 265, 54 P.3d 433, 436 
(2002) (applying 
Leslie definition to the term "action" in 
HRS § 378-5(c) (1993)); accord HRS § 490:1-201(1) (2008) (regarding the definition of "action"); HRS § 658B-1 (2016) 
(defining "action"); cf., e.g., Calleon v. Miyagi
, 76 Hawai# i 
310, 315-20, 876 P.2d 1278, 1283-88 (1994) (distinguishing 
between different claims within a suit). Therefore, when applicable, HRS § 514B-162(b)(4) applies to the action, not a claim or claims within the action. 
While the parties here were free to otherwise agree to 
a different scope of mandatory arbitration, there is no evidence or argument that they did so. 
Actions – not individual claims 
within an action – seeking equitable relief involving threatened property damage or the health or safety of unit owners or any other person are statutorily exempted from the arbitration 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
mandate in HRS § 514B-162(a). The McKernans' suit or action, as 
set forth in the Complaint, seeks equitable relief involving threatened property damage or the health or safety of the McKernans and/or their guests. Thus, we conclude that the Circuit Court did not err in rejecting the AOAO's argument that certain claims within the suit were subject to mandatory arbitration pursuant to HRS § 514B-162(a), based on the exemption set forth in HRS § 514B-162(b)(4).

Accordingly, the Circuit Court's July 31, 2019 Order 
Denying Arbitration is affirmed.

3 The AOAO's argument that the McKernans should be estopped from
relying on HRS § 514B-162(b)(4) is raised for the first time on appeal and is
deemed waived. See, e.g., Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Wailea Elua v. Wailea
Resort Co., Ltd
, 100 Hawai #i 97, 107, 58 P.3d 608, 618 (2002).
