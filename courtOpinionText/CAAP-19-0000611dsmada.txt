ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL
(By:  Chan, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.)
Upon review of the record, it appears that:
(1) On September 3, 2019, self-represented Petitioner-
Appellant Maunu Renah Williams (Williams) filed the notice of
appeal;
(2) On October 14, 2019, the circuit court clerk filed
the record on appeal, and the appellate clerk notified the
parties that the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief were
due on or before October 24, 2019, and November 25, 2019,
respectively;
(3) Williams did not file either document or request an
extension of time;
(4) On December 3, 2019, the appellate clerk notified
Williams that the time for filing the statement of jurisdiction
and opening brief had expired, the matter would be called to the
court's attention on December 13, 2019, for appropriate action,
which could include dismissal of the appeal, under Hawai#i RulesNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rules 12.1(e) and 30, and Williams
may request relief from default by motion; and
(5) The appellate clerk mailed the notice entering case
on calendar and the default notice to Williams at Halawa
Correctional Facility, which is Williams's address of record in
this appeal.  The United States Postal Service returned the
envelopes because he was no longer at that address.  Williams has
not filed a notice of change of address, consistent with HRAP
Rule 25(f), and he took no further action in this appeal.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is
dismissed, under HRAP Rules 12.1(e) and 30, respectively, for
failure to file the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are
dismissed.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, January 21, 2020.
