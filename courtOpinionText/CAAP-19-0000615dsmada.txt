OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
YURIE YAMANO, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
HALEKULANI CORPORATION; ULRICH KRAUER (General Manager of the
Halekulani Hotel); JASON WATERLOW (Director of Food and
Beverage); NICOLE L. BONENFANT (Director of Human Resources);
OSWALDO RABAGO (Asst. Director of Food and Beverage),

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 19-1-0432)
ORDER
DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
AND
DISMISSING ALL PENDING MOTIONS AS MOOT
(By:  Ginoza Chief Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.)
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
appellate jurisdiction over this appeal by Plaintiff-Appellant
Yurie Yamano (Yamano), self-represented, from the Honorable Deane
Ochiai's June 13, 2019 interlocutory order denying Yamano's
May 7, 2019 motion for a default judgment in circuit court Civil
No. 19-1-0432-03 (DEO) (the June 13, 2019 interlocutory order),
because the circuit court has neither adjudicated Yamano's causes
of action nor entered an appealable final judgment.
Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 641-1(a) (2016)
authorizes appeals to the Hawai#i Intermediate Court of Appeals
from final judgments, orders, or decrees.  Appeals under HRS
§ 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rulesNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
of court."  HRS § 641-1(c).  Rule 58 of the Hawai#i Rules of
Civil Procedure (HRCP) requires that "[e]very judgment shall be
set forth on a separate document."  Based on this requirement
under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai# i has held that
"[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been
reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor
of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to
HRCP [Rule] 58[.]"  Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76
Hawai#i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994).  "Thus, based on
Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it
resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been
reduced to a separate judgment."  Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119
Hawai#i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008); Bailey v.
DuVauchelle, 135 Hawai#i 482, 489, 353 P.3d 1024, 1031 (2015). 
Consequently, "[a]n appeal from an order that is not reduced to a
judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is
filed in the supreme court will be dismissed."  Jenkins, 76
Hawai#i at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote omitted).  The June
13, 2019 interlocutory order is not a final judgment.  On October
1, 2019, the circuit court clerk filed the record on appeal for
appellate court case number CAAP-19-0000615, which does not
include a final judgment.
Although exceptions to the final judgment requirement
exist under the doctrine in Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848)
(the Forgay doctrine), the collateral order doctrine, and HRS
§ 641-1(b) (2016), the June 13, 2019 interlocutory order does not
satisfy the requirements for appealability under the Forgay
doctrine, the collateral order doctrine, or HRS § 641-1(b).  See
Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai# i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995)
(regarding the two requirements for appealability under the
Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88
Hawai#i 319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding the three
requirements for the collateral order doctrine); HRS § 641-1(b)
(regarding the requirements for an appeal from an interlocutory
order).  Furthermore, a temporary remand pursuant to HRS § 602-
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
57(3) (2016) and the holding in Waikiki v. Ho #omaka Village
Association of Apartment Owners, 140 Hawai# i 197, 204, 398 P.3d
786, 793 (2017), is not appropriate, because the circuit court
has not yet adjudicated any of Yamano's causes of action.  Absent
an appealable final judgment, we lack appellate jurisdiction.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Yamano's appeal in
appellate court case number CAAP-19-0000615 is dismissed for lack
of appellate jurisdiction.
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions
are dismissed as moot.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, March 5, 2020.
