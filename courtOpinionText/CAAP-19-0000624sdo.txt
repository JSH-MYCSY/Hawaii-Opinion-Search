 Judgment,1 entered by the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit 
(Circuit Court)2 in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee Wilmington Trust, 
NA, Successor Trustee to Citibank, N.A., as Trustee, for the 
Benefit of Registered Holders of Structured Asset Mortgage Investments II Trust 2007-AR2, Mortgage Pass-Through 
Certificates, Series 2007-AR2 (Wilmington).  
  Upon review of the record on appeal and relevant legal 
authorities, giving due consideration to any discernible issues raised and arguments advanced by the parties, we affirm.    Kaulia-Webb filed a November 6, 2019 "Affidavit of 
Appeal/Jurat Brief" and "Affidavit of Appeal/Jurat Brief On support of argument," which we construe as an Opening Brief (collectively, Opening Brief).
3  The Opening Brief does not 
comply with HRAP Rule 28(b) in multiple respects, both in form and substance, and does not contain record references.  Nor does the record contain transcripts of the August 21, 2019 hearing on Wilmington's Motion for Confirmation of Sale that led to the 
Judgment from which Kaulia-Webb appeals.  See HRAP Rule 
10(b)(1)(A).   
 
1  In the Notice of Appeal, Kaulia- Webb appeals from a "Judgment 
Order entered in this action on August 21, 2019."  The record, however, 
reflects no August 21, 2019 Judgment, but contains a Judgment filed on 
September 18, 2019, following an August 21, 2019 hearing on Wilmington's 
"Motion for Confirmation of Sale, Distribution of Proceeds, and for Writ of 
Ejectment" (Motion for Confirmation of Sale).  The Circuit Court granted the motion and filed an order confirming sale, followed by the September 18, 2019 
Judgment.  We construe Kaulia- Webb's notice to appeal from this Judgment.   
 
2  The Honorable Peter T. Cahill presided.   
 
3  The "Affidavit of Appeal/Jurat Brief" consists of 193 pages 
including "unrebutted (exhibits) affidavits," which do not indicate where, 
and whether, they are a part of the record on appeal in this case.  See 
Hawai‘i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(a) (requiring that an 
opening brief " shall not exceed 35 pages"); Alford v. City & Cnty. of 
Honolulu, 109 Hawai‘ i 14, 25 n.18, 122 P.3d 809, 820 n.18 (2005) ("References 
and appendices not part of the record on appeal cannot be considered.  This 
is a violation of HRAP Rule 10 . . . .") ( citation omitted); Bettencourt v. 
Bettencourt, 80 Hawai‘ i 225, 229 n.2, 909 P.2d 553, 557 n.2 (1995) (holding 
that matters outside the record on appeal may neither be appended nor referred to in an appellate brief) (citati on omitted).

  While appellate courts endeavor to afford liberal 
review to pleadings by self-represented litigants "to facilitate 
access to justice" and to afford opportunity for appellate review despite their non-compliance with court rules, Kaulia-Webb's Opening Brief does not present comprehensible or 
discernible legal argument.  See Erum v. Llego, 147 Hawai‘ i 368, 
380-81, 465 P.3d 815, 827-28 (2020) (citations omitted).  
Appellate review is not possible.  See HRAP Rule 28(b); Marvin 
v. Pflueger, 127 Hawai‘ i 490, 496, 280 P.3d 88, 94 (2012) 
(requiring appellate courts to "adhere[ ] to the policy of affording litigants the opportunity to have their cases heard on the merits, where possible" (emphasis added) (cleaned up)).
4  
  For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the September 18, 2019 Judgment, entered by the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit. 
  DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai‘ i, April 5, 2024.

4  Wilmington argues that the appeal "should be dismissed" because 
Kaulia-Webb's "brief does not comply" with HRAP Rule 28(b), "is wholly 
incomprehensible[,]" and that it " cannot properly respond to arguments that 
are incoherent and lack any justification."
