TATE OF HAWAI# I, Respondent-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(S.P.P. NO. 2PR151000005 and CR. NO. 2PC131000428) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: 
Ginoza, Chief Judge, Hiraoka and McCullen, JJ.) 
Self-represented Petitioner-Appellant Nelson Nahinu
Waikiki,
 Jr. appeals from the "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of 
Law, and Order Dismissing Petitioner's Non-Conforming Petition to 
Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner 
from Custody" entered by the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit on August 7, 2019.
1 For the reasons explained below, we affirm 
the Order. 
On May 1, 2015, Waikiki was convicted of securities 
fraud, failure to meet securities registration requirements, and failure to meet broker-dealer requirements and exemptions. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison. He filed two direct appeals, representing himself. The appeals were consolidated. His only discernible argument was that he was a citizen of the

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Kingdom of Hawai# i and not subject to prosecution by the State of 
Hawai# i
. We affirmed the conviction and sentence based upon 
State v. Fergerstrom, 106 Hawai# i 43, 55, 101 P.3d 652, 664 (App. 
2004), aff'd, 106 Hawai# i 41, 101 P.3d 225 (2004) and State v. 
Kaulia, 128 Hawai# i 479, 487, 291 P.3d 377, 385 (2013). State v. 
Waikiki, Nos. CAAP-15-0000415, CAAP-15-0000416 (Consolidated), 
2016 WL 4062843, at *1 (Haw. App. July 26, 2016) (SDO) (
Waikiki I). 
Waikiki also filed a Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or 
Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner From Custody, under Rule 40 of the Hawai# i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) on May 18, 
2015. The Petition was dismissed for non-payment of fees. Waikiki filed an 
Amended Petition on November 1, 2018. The 
Order, which dismissed the Amended Petition without a hearing, was entered on August 7, 2019. This appeal followed. 
Waikiki argues four issues on appeal:
2 (1) violation of 
his right to a speedy trial; (2) illegal plea agreement;
(3) illegal sentence; and (4) lack of jurisdiction.3 We review a 
circuit court's order denying an HRPP Rule 40 petition without a 
hearing based on no showing of a colorable claim de novo, under the right/wrong standard of review. Dan v. State, 76 Hawai# i 
423, 427, 879 P.2d 528, 532 (1994). 
HRPP Rule 40 provides for post-conviction relief 
subject to the following: 
2 Waikiki's opening brief does not comply with Rule 28(b)(4) of the
Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure ( HRAP ). However, to promote access to
justice the Hawai #i Supreme Court instructs that pleadings prepared by
self-represented litigants should be interpreted liberally, and
self-represented litigants should not automatically be foreclosed fromappellate review because they fail to comply with court rules. Erum v. Llego,
147 Hawai #i 368, 380-81, 465 P.3d 815, 827-28 (2020). Accordingly, we address
what we discern to be Waikiki's arguments. 
3 Waikiki also claims that the State "denied Waikiki case 
'Discovery' still to this day." We disregard this issue because Waikiki'sopening brief presents no discernible argument on it. See Kaho #ohanohano v. 
Dep't of Hum. Servs., State of Haw., 117 Hawai #i 262, 297 n.37, 178 P.3d 538,
573 n.37 (2008) (stating that supreme court will "disregard a particularcontention if the appellant makes no discernible argument in support of thatposition") (cleaned up). See also HRAP Rule 28(b)(7) ("Points not argued may
be deemed waived.").

(3) INAPPLICABILITY . Rule 40 proceedings shall not be
available and relief thereunder shall not be granted where
the issues sought to be raised have been previously ruled 
upon  or were waived . Except for a claim of illegal
sentence, an issue is waived if the petitioner knowingly andunderstandingly failed to raise it and it could have beenraised before the trial, at the trial, on appeal, in ahabeas corpus proceeding or any other proceeding actuallyconducted, or in a prior proceeding actually initiated underthis rule, and the petitioner is unable to prove theexistence of extraordinary circumstances to justify thepetitioner's failure to raise the issue. There is a rebuttable presumption that a failure to appeal a ruling orto raise an issue is a knowing and understanding failure. 
(Emphasis added.)
1. Waikiki contends he was deprived of his right to a 
speedy trial under the federal and state constitutions and HRPP 
Rule 48. Waikiki moved to dismiss his criminal case on that basis. The circuit court denied the motion. Waikiki could have, but did not, directly appeal the denial. Waikiki presents no extraordinary circumstances to justify his failure to raise the issue on direct appeal. The issue is waived. HRPP Rule 40(a)(3). 
2. Waikiki contends the plea agreement he was offered 
was illegal and he never signed the change of plea form.

Waikiki made this argument to the circuit court in his criminal case. The circuit court rejected his arguments. He could have, but did not, directly appeal the circuit court order. Waikiki presents no extraordinary circumstances to justify his failure to raise the issue on direct appeal. The issue is waived. HRPP Rule 40(a)(3).
3. Waikiki contends his sentence is illegal. He 
pleaded guilty in his criminal case pursuant to a plea agreement. In exchange for his guilty plea, the State agreed to (among other things) reduce each count in his indictment from a class A felony to a class B felony. On May 1, 2015, the circuit court sentenced Waikiki to ten years on each of the four counts of the 
4 Waikiki's signature appears on the second page of the Guilty Plea
filed on April 11, 2014.

indictment, with counts 1 and 2 to run concurrently, counts 3 and 
4 to run concurrently, and counts 1 and 2 to run consecutively with counts 3 and 4, for a total of 20 years. Waikiki moved to reconsider his sentence. The circuit court denied reconsideration. 
Waikiki contends his sentence is illegal because it is 
an "enhanced sentence" that was not charged in his indictment and not presented to a jury, citing State v. Boyd, Nos. 24525, 24526, 24527, 2004 WL 909729 (Haw. April 29, 2004) (SDO). Waikiki's sentence was not "enhanced," nor was it an "extended term" sentence, see Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 706-661 (2014). 
Waikiki was sentenced for four class B felonies. The maximum 
length of imprisonment for a class B felony is ten years. HRS § 706-660(1)(a) (2014). The circuit court imposed consecutive sentences after considering the factors set forth in HRS § 706-606,
5 as authorized under HRS § 706-668.5,6 and stated its 
5 HRS § 706-606 (2014) provides: 
Factors to be considered in imposing a sentence . The court,
in determining the particular sentence to be imposed, shall
consider: 
(1) The nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of thedefendant; 
(2) The need for the sentence imposed: 
(a) To reflect the seriousness of the offense,
to promote respect for law, and to providejust punishment for the offense; 
(b) To afford adequate deterrence to criminalconduct; 
(c) To protect the public from further crimesof the defendant; and 
(d) To provide the defendant with needededucational or vocational training,medical care, or other correctionaltreatment in the most effective manner; 
(3) The kinds of sentences available; and 
(4) The need to avoid unwarranted sentence 
disparities among defendants with similar

reasons as to why a consecutive sentence rather than a concurrent 
one was required. State v. Hussein, 122 Hawai# i 495, 509, 229 
P.3d 313, 327 (2010) (holding that "a court must state its reasons as to why a consecutive sentence rather than a concurrent one was required"). Waikiki's sentence was not illegal.
4. Waikiki contends in his opening brief that he "is 
not subject to the Laws of the STATE OF HAWAII" because "the lawful political status of the Hawaiian Islands is that of a sovereign nation-state in continuity; but a nation-state that has been under 100 years, years of a strange form of occupation by the United States resulting from an illegal military occupation and a fraudulent annexation[.]" 
His argument was considered and 
rejected in Waikiki I
. 
Based upon the foregoing, we affirm the "Findings of 
Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Dismissing Petitioner's Non-Conforming Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner from Custody" entered by the circuit court on August 7, 2019.
