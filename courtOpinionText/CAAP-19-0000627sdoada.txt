  following a jury-waived trial on fraudulent transfer claims,
under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 651C-4.  2 
  On appeal, the Bevills contend that the Circuit Court 
erred in concluding that:  (1) the two separate transfers of 
real property owned by Maurizio, both by separate deeds to his son, Gaetano, were "part of a pre-existing estate plan and not made with the intent to defraud the Bevills from collecting on a 
judgment against [Maurizio]" challenging FOF 21 and COLs 3, 4, 
7, and 8; and (2) the applicable statute of limitations under HRS § 651C-9
3 was violated, challenging FOFs 22-23 and COLs 5-6. 
  
                     
2  The Bevills' complaint alleged that Maurizio transferred his 
interests in the subject property "without proper consideration and/or for 
the purpose of hindering creditors."

the transfer or incurred the obligation: 
 
  
 
(1) With actual intent to hinder, delay, or 
 
defraud any creditor of the debtor

 Upon careful review of the record and the briefs  
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve the Bevills' contentions of error as follows, and affirm.   On May 5, 2002, Maurizio's father, Frank Harold Maurizio, passed away intestate while owning a fifty percent 
interest in Tax Map Key No. (2)5-1-4-27 (Property).  FOFs 5 and 
7.
4  Maurizio's father had stated that the Property was to be 
inherited by Gaetano.  FOF 10.  Maurizio retained an attorney to 
assist in probating his father's estate and transferring the Property.  FOF 8.  After receiving the attorney's advice on the tax implications of transferring the Property directly from Maurizio's father's estate to Gaetano, Maurizio decided to first 
transfer the Property to his mother, Jean Maurizio (Jean), 
through the probate estate.  FOF 11.  On April 10, 2008, Jean 
conveyed title to the Property to Maurizio "as part of the continued estate plan[,] with the understanding that [Maurizio] would then convey the Property to Gaetano soon thereafter."  FOFs 13 and 14.  
On May 30, 2008, the Bevills filed a Complaint against 
Maurizio and other defendants in Bevill v. Maurizio et al., 
Civil No. 08-1-0293(1), for multiple tort claims (Initial Lawsuit).
5  FOF 19.  
On June 8, 2009, Maurizio transferred the Property to 
Gaetano by filing a deed with a reserved life estate (First Conveyance) with the Office of the Assistant Registrar of the 
Land Court, State of Hawai‘ i (Land Court).  FOFs 16 and 17.  On 
                     
4  FOFs not challenged on appeal are binding.  Kaho‘ohanohano v. 
Dep't of Hum. Servs., State of Haw., 117 Hawai ‘i 262, 267, 178 P.3d 538, 543

 January 31, 2011, Maurizio filed a Quitclaim of Life Estate 
Interest (
Second Conveyance) with the Land Court.  FOF 18.  
On January 23, 2012, a jury trial commenced in the 
Initial Lawsuit, and on March 21, 2012, a jury entered a verdict 
against all defendants.  FOF 20.  On February 5, 2015, a Final Judgment in the Initial Lawsuit was entered in favor of the Bevills and against Maurizio for $290,000.00. 
On June 26, 2015, Maurizio filed for Chapter 7 
bankruptcy.  On October 4, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered a Final Judgment that $270,000.00 of the Bevills' Final Judgment was non-dischargeable debt. 
On July 25, 2017, the Bevills filed the complaint 
underlying this appeal, seeking to set aside the First and Second Conveyances of the Property from Maurizio to Gaetano 
based on fraudulent transfer (Current Lawsuit).  
At the June 12, 2019 trial in the Current Lawsuit, the 
Bevills were not present and did not testify.  The Bevills 
relied on the following exhibits to prove "intent" from a timeline of events:  the Complaint and Final Judgment filed in the Initial Lawsuit; the records of the First and Second 
Conveyance; the Chapter 7 Petition and Final Judgment entered in 
Maurizio's bankruptcy case; and interrogatories of Maurizio and Gaetano stating that the First and Second Conveyances were for nominal consideration.  On the other hand, Maurizio testified that he did not intend to fraudulently transfer the Property; that Maurizio contacted an estate attorney in 2005-2006, well before the Initial Lawsuit; and the estate attorney advised Maurizio to reserve a life estate interest despite his plan to give the entire Property to Gaetano.  Maurizio argued that the Current Lawsuit was untimely, and that the Bevills knew that Maurizio was not the homeowner of the Property as early as March of 2013.  The Bevills countered that HRS § 651C-9 should not   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTE R

 have accrued until they definitively learned of the transfers, 
and that no other explanation existed for the Second Conveyance other than to defraud the Bevills. 
On August 7, 2019, the Circuit Court made the 
following relevant FOFs and COLs at issue in this appeal:  
 
FINDINGS OF FACT 
 
. . . . 
 
21. The Court finds that the Maurizio family's plan to 
    
have the Property transfer to Gaetano was in place  
    prior to the filing of the complaint in the 2008  
    Action. 
  
. . . . 
 
. . . . CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 
 
 
3. [The Bevills] failed to produce evidence that  
   
Defendants fraudulently transferred the Property. 
 
4. Defendants proved that the initial transfer of the 
   
Property and the transfer of the life estate interest  
   from [Maurizio] to Gaetano were in furtherance of a  
   long- standing plan for the Property to be transferred  
   from [Maurizio's] father to Gaetano. 
  . . . . 
 
7. [The Bevills] bore the burdens of proof and  
   persuasion. [The Bevills] failed to carry these 
 
   burdens regarding the allegations in their Complaint.      The Court concludes that the evidence adduced at trial  
   does not demonstrate a fraudulent transfer on the part  
   of Defendants.   
8. Defendants did not fraudulently transfer the Property. 
 
. . . . 
 
The Bevills first contend that the Circuit Court erred 
in finding and concluding in FOF 21 and COLs 3, 4, 7, and 8, that the transfers from Maurizio to Gaetano were part of a pre-existing plan and not fraudulent under HRS § 651C-4.  The   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTE R

 Bevills argue that Maurizio's father's intent to give the 
Property to Gaetano was accomplished by the First Conveyance to Gaetano, and that the Second Conveyance, which transferred the life estate interest to Gaetano, was used to shield the Property from collection.  The Bevills claim that the Circuit Court failed to consider whether Maurizio had the "intent" to defraud under HRS § 651C-4(b)(1), (2), (4), and (5),
 as Maurizio 
transferred the Property to an "insider,"  continued to reside on 76
the Property, and litigation was pending during the transfers. Additionally, the Bevills argue that the transfers were for substantially all of Maurizio's primary assets as demonstrated by Maurizio's bankruptcy petition. 
In a fraudulent transfer case, the plaintiff bears the 
burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that a 
fraudulent transfer occurred.  Kekona v. Abastillas, 113 Hawai‘ i 
174, 180-82, 150 P.2d 823, 829-31 (2006).  "It is that degree of 
proof which will produce in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief or conviction as to the allegations sought to be 
established, and requires the existence of a fact be highly 
                     
6  HRS § 651C-4 (b) states in pertinent part: 
 
(b) In determining actual intent under subsection (a) 
(1), consideration may be given, among other factors, to  
whether: 
 (1)
 The transfer or obligation was to an insider; 
 
(2) The debtor had retained possession or control 
of the property transferred after the transfer; 
 
 . . . . 
 
(4)
 Before the transfer was made or obligation was  
incurred, the debtor was sued or threatened with suit; 
 
(5) The transfer was of substantially all the  
debtor's assets[.] 
  
7  HRS § 651C- 1 (2016) defines " insider" as a "relative of the 
debtor or of a general partner of the debtor."   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTE R

 probable."  Id. at 180, 150 P.2d at 829 (internal quotation 
marks and citations omitted).  FOF 21, in which the Circuit 
Court found that Maurizio's family's "plan to have the Property transfer to Gaetano was in place prior to the filing" of the Initial Lawsuit was supported by Maurizio's testimony and exhibits.  Although there was evidence of some of the HRS § 651(b) factors that may be considered in determining fraudulent 
intent, we conclude that substantial evidence supports FOF 21, 
and we are not left with a definite and firm conviction that a 
mistake has been made.  See Schmidt v. HSC, Inc., 145 Hawai‘ i 
351, 360, 452 P.3d 348, 357 (2019) (internal quotation marks and 
citations omitted) (A FOF is clearly erroneous if the record "lacks substantial evidence to support the finding," or despite evidence supporting the finding, "the appellate court is left with the definite and firm conviction in reviewing the entire evidence that a mistake has been committed.").  For the same reasons, COLs 3, 4, 7, and 8, which appear to be mixed FOFs and COLs, where the Circuit Court concluded that the evidence did 
not establish that the transfers were fraudulent, are supported 
by substantial evidence and not clearly erroneous; nor are we 
convinced that a mistake has been made.  See Uyeda v. Schermer, 
144 Hawai‘ i 163, 170, 439 P.3d 115, 122 (2019) (quoting Narayan 
v. Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Kapalua Bay Condo., 140 Hawaii ‘ 
75, 83, 398 P.3d 664, 672 (2017)) ("'Where a conclusion of law 
presents a mixed question of law and fact, we review this 
conclusion under the clearly erroneous standard.'"); Schmidt, 
145 Hawaii ‘ at 360, 452 P.3d at 357. 
In light of our resolution of the Bevills' first 
contention, it is not necessary for us to address the Bevills' remaining contention regarding the statute of limitations.   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTE R

of Fact and Conclusions of Law and Order by the Court and (2) 
Judgment in favor of Defendants-Appellees Frank Lewis Maurizio and Frank Gaetano Maurizio, both filed and entered on August 7, 2019 by the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit.
