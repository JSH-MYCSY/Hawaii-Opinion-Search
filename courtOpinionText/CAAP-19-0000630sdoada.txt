DARRYL THOMAS, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI#I, Respondent-Appellee
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(S.P.P. NO. 17-1-0019; CRIMINAL NO. 1PC141001031)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.)
Petitioner-Appellant Darryl Thomas ( Thomas) appeals pro
se from the Order Summarily Denying [Hawai# i Rules of Penal
Procedure ( HRPP)] Rule 40 Petition filed by Petitioner Darryl
Thomas (Order Denying Relief) entered on May 29, 2019, in the
First Circuit Court, State of Hawai#i (Circuit Court ), in S.P.P.
No. 17-1-0019.   In the Order Denying Relief, the Circuit Court
denied Thomas's Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct
Judgment or to Release Petitioner from Custody (Petition ), which
was filed pursuant to HRPP Rule 40 on August 29, 2017. 1/
Thomas states no discernible points of error on appeal
but appears to challenge the sentence entered against him by the
1/The Honorable Fa #auuga To #oto#o presided.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Circuit Court in the underlying criminal case, 1PC141001031
(Criminal Case), arguing that the pre-sentence report (PSI )
contains inaccuracies and that he was not provided an adequate
opportunity to address them at sentencing.  
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve Thomas's appeal as follows: 
On June 13, 2017, Thomas appealed from his conviction
in the Criminal Case in CAAP-17-0000471.  Thomas argued in his
reply brief, inter alia , that the PSI contains inaccuracies.  On
January 16, 2019, this court issued a Summary Disposition Order
affirming Thomas's conviction, and in a footnote, deemed the
issues raised in the reply brief waived, noting that appealable
issues must be raised in an opening brief.  State v. Thomas,
CAAP-17-10000471, 2019 WL 211069, *1, n.3 (Haw. App. Jan. 16,
2019) (SDO).  In the same footnote, we stated that "[t]his waiver
is not absolute and is subject to the court's inherent authority
to address plain error and without prejudice to a[n HRPP Rule 40]
petition for post-conviction relief in conjunction with claims of
ineffective assistance from trial and/or appellate counsel ."  Id.
(citing Briones v. State, 74 Haw. 442, 459, 848 P.2d 966, 975
(1993)) (emphases added).  However, because this appeal does not
argue a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, or raise a
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
claim of illegal sentence,  the issue is deemed waived.  HRPP
Rule 40(a)(3). 2/
Having raised no other issues on appeal, Thomas
presents no basis for this court to find that he raised a
colorable claim in his Petition.  See Dan v. State, 76 Hawai#i
423, 427, 879 P.2d 528, 532 (1994).  Thus, the Circuit Court did
not err in denying the Petition without a hearing.  See Barnett
v. State, 91 Hawai# i 20, 26, 979 P.2d 1046, 1052 (1999).
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's May 29, 2019 
Order Denying Relief is affirmed.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, April 29, 2021.

for Respondent-Appellee.
2/ A sentence is illegal if the sentencing court lacks authority to
impose it, or it is imposed in violation of the law.  See, e.g., Stanley v.
State, 148 Hawai #i 489, 502, 479 P.3d 107, 120 (2021); Flubacher v. State, 142
Hawai#i 109, 110-11, 414 P.3d 161, 162-63 (2018); Moananu v. State,
CAAP-18-0000447, 2020 WL 3034708, *6 (Haw. App. June 5, 2020) (mem.).  Upon
review of the record in the underlying Criminal Case, including the transcript
of the May 24, 2017 sentencing hearing, we cannot conclude that Thomas was
denied an adequate opportunity to address the trial court at sentencing.
