IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI#I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
KAPANA B. THRONAS-KAHO# ONEI, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
(CASE NO. 5CPC-19-000061)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By:  Chan, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.)
Upon review of this appeal filed by Defendant-Appellant
Kapana B. Thronas-Kaho# onei (Appellant ), self-represented, on
September 12, 2019 in Appeal CAAP-19-0000638 (9/12/19 Notice of
Appeal), it appears that we lack jurisdiction over the appeal. 
Appellant's 9/12/19 Notice of Appeal does not clearly identify or
attach the order or judgment from which he seeks to appeal; to
the extent Appellant seeks to appeal from the final disposition
of his criminal case, no jurisdiction currently exists because no
sentence has been entered and no judgment of conviction has been
filed.  Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-11.
The 9/12/19 Notice of Appeal also does not effectively
appeal from the August 23, 2019 "Order Denying Defendant's Motion
to Suppress; 'Promotion v. Posession' (sic) Leading to Motion to
Dismiss Filed on July 31, 2019[,]" which appears to be the only
order from which the 9/12/19 Notice of Appeal would have been
timely filed, because no leave to file an appeal from an
interlocutory order pursuant to HRS § 641-17 was granted; anNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
order denying a motion to suppress is not appealable under the
collateral order exception to the final judgment rule.   No
authority permits an appeal from an order denying a criminal
defendant's motion to dismiss.   We lack jurisdiction over this
appeal.3/2/1/
THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, March 16, 2020.

1/  State v. Kealaiki, 95 Hawai #i 309, 316–17, 22 P.3d 588, 595–96
(2001).
2/  This is distinguished from State v. Nicol, 140 Hawai #i 482, 493–94,
403 P.3d 259, 270–71 (2017), where the Hawai#i Supreme Court determined that a
defendant may appeal from the grant of a motion to dismiss a case without
prejudice.
3/  Appellant may file a notice of appeal after the judgment of
conviction is filed, as permitted under HRS § 641-11, within the time and in
the manner provided by the Hawai#i Rules of Appellate Procedure and applicable
case law.
