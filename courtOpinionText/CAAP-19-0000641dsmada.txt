NO. CAAP-19-0000641
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAII, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
ROBERT QUARTERO, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
HONOLULU DIVISION
(CASE NO. 1DTC-17-073529)
ORDER
DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
AND
DISMISSING ALL PENDING MOTIONS AS MOOT
(By:  Fujise, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.)
Upon review of the record in appellate court case
number CAAP-19-0000641, it appears that we lack appellate
jurisdiction pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-
12(a) (2016).  In this appeal, Defendant-Appellant Robert
Quartero (Quartero), self-represented, appears to be appealing
from Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawaii's (the State) October 30,
2017 citation for operating a motor vehicle without a valid
license in violation of HRS § 286-102 (2007 & Supp. 2018) in
district court case number 1DTC-17-0073529.  The Honorable
Harlan Y. Kimura most recently entered a September 16, 2019
interlocutory order (1) granting a motion by Quartero's counsel
to withdraw from representing Quartero and (2)  granting
Quartero's request to stay the proceedings for ninety days.  InNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
the absence of a judgment with a final decision, the dismissal of
this appeal is warranted.
"The right of appeal in a criminal case is purely
statutory[.]"  State v. Nicol, 140 Hawai #i 482, 485, 403 P.3d
259, 262 (2017) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
The Hawai#i Intermediate Court of Appeals has jurisdiction "[t]o
hear and determine appeals from any court or agency when appeals
are allowed by law[.]"  HRS § 602-57(1) (2016).  HRS § 641-12(a)
is the statute providing that "[a]ppeals upon the record shall be
allowed from all final decisions and final judgments of district
courts in all criminal matters."  Consequently, "in order to
appeal a criminal matter in the district court, the appealing
party must appeal from a written judgment or order that has been
filed with the clerk of the court pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(b)(3)." 
State v. Bohannon, 102 Hawai# i 228, 236, 74 P.3d 980, 988 (2003);
see also Rule 32(c)(2) of the Hawai#i Rules of Penal Procedure. 
In order to perfect a defendant's right to appeal from a district
court criminal case pursuant to HRS § 641-12(a), the district
court must enter either a judgment of conviction with a complete
sentence, or an order dismissing the complaint, thereby
terminating the proceedings and leaving nothing further to be
accomplished by the district court.  State v. Kilborn, 109
Hawai#i 435, 442, 127 P.3d 95, 102 (App. 2005) (regarding the
appealability of a district court judgment of conviction and
sentence under HRS § 641-12); Nicol, 140 Hawai#i at 491, 403 P.3d
at 268 (Explaining that "under the Hawaii Revised Statutes,
district court defendants . . . in . . . district . . . court may
appeal from an order dismissing proceedings without prejudice." 
(Citations omitted)).  The State's citation for operating a motor
vehicle without a valid license in violation of HRS § 286-102 has
not yet gone to trial.  Therefore, Quartero's appeal is
premature, and we lack appellate jurisdiction.
For the purpose of assisting the district court in
future similar circumstances, we note that it is unnecessary for
the district court to continue a trial based on a
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
jurisdictionally defective appeal.  "Generally, the filing of a
notice of appeal divests the trial court of jurisdiction over the
appealed case."  TSA International Ltd. v. Shimizu Corp., 92
Hawai#i 243, 265, 990 P.2d 713, 735 (1999) (citations omitted). 
"The general rule, however, assumes that the notice of appeal is
valid under the applicable statutory provisions and procedural
rules.  Where the notice of appeal is jurisdictionally defective,
filing the notice does not transfer jurisdiction from the trial
court to the appellate court."  State v. Ontiveros, 82 Hawai#i
446, 449, 923 P.2d 388, 391 (1996) (citations omitted; emphasis
added).
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that CAAP-19-0000641 is
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions
in CAAP-19-0000641 are dismissed as moot.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, November 15, 2019.
