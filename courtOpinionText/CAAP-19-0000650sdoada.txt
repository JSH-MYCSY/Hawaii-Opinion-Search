STATE OF HAWAIʻI, DEPARTMENT OF LAND AND NATURAL RESOURCES, 
Employer-Appellant-Cross-Appellee/Appellee, and 
STATE OF HAWAIʻ I, DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT, 
Adjuster-Appellant-Appellee. 
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD 
(CASE NO. AB 2008-266(S); (2-07-40277))  
  
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka and McCullen, J.) 
Claimant-Appellee-Cross-Appellant/Appellant Dennis T. 
Ihara (Ihara) appeals from the Labor and Industrial Relations 
Appeals Board's (Board) August 21, 2019 "Order Adopting Proposed 
Decision and Order" (Decision and Order). 
The Board determined Ihara was entitled to vocational 
rehabilitation services, and awarded him 1% permanent partial disability (or 
PPD) of the entire person for hypertension and a 
2% permanent partial disability of the entire person for a   
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
psychological injury suffered in the course of his employment 
with Employer-Appellant-Cross-Appellee/Appellee State of Hawai‘ i, 
Department of Land and Natural Resources (
DLNR). In his points 
of error on appeal, Ihara challenges Findings of Fact (FOF) 11, 
12, 14, and 17, and Conclusion of Law (COL) 1.1 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve Ihara's 
points of error as discussed below, and affirm. 
(1) First, Ihara contends the Board "erred in FOF 11 
that [he] has no ratable permanent impairment as a result of his 
work injury." This finding states: 
FOF 11: "The Board finds that Claimant has no 
ratable permanent impairment as a 
result of his work injury." 
Hawai‘i Revised S
tatutes (HRS) chapter 386 does not 
define "ratable permanent impairment." This court previously 
1 In his points of error on appeal, Ihara also challenges FOF 4, 6, 8, 
and 15. 
FOF 4, 6, and 8 make credibility determinations, which we will not 
disturb on appeal. See generally, Pave v. Prod. Processing, Inc.
, 152 Hawaiʻi 
164, 172, 524 P.3d 355, 363 (App. 2022) (stating when reviewing FOF, this 
court "cannot consider the weight of the evidence to ascertain whether it 
weighs in favor of the administrative findings, or review the agency's findings of fact by passing upon credibility of witnesses or conflicts in 
testimony") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
Regarding FOF 15, Ihara presents no discussion, factual analysis, or 
authority 
to support his challenge to this finding and, thus, we consider 
this point of error waived. Hawai‘i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
Rule 28(b)(4) and (b)(7).

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
observed that the Board's finding of "no ratable permanent 
impairment" was ambiguous in that it either meant Ihara 
"suffered no impairment," or "that he had suffered some 
impairment; but in an amount incapable of being measured." 
Ihara v. State, Dep't of Land & Nat. Res., 136 Hawai‘ i 372, 362 
P.3d 805, No. CAAP-12-0000398, 2015 WL 6739078 at *8 (App. 
Oct. 30, 2015) (mem. op.) Because the Board entered the same 
finding on remand, but also found Ihara was entitled to 2% PPD, 
we construe FOF 11 as meaning Ihara suffered some impairment, 
but in an amount the doctors could not rate under the American 
Medical Association Guides. 
As none of the doctors opined on a specific impairment 
rating, FOF 11 is not clearly erroneous. 
See generally, Tauese
v. State, Dep't of Lab. & Indus. Rels., 113 Hawai‘ i 1, 25, 147 
P.3d 785, 809 (2006) (applying clearly erroneous standard of review to FOF). 
(2)  Next, Ihara challenges FOF 12 and 14, which 
state: 
FOF 12: "The Board further finds, that Claimant 
is able to resume regular duty work, but his sole restriction is that it not be with the co-workers he had at the 
time of the February 1, 2007 work 
injury." 
3   
 
 
 
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
FOF 14:  "The Board finds that Claimant's only 
permanent impairment of a mental function is his inability to work with the co-workers he worked with at the time of his February 1, 2007 work injury, which also affects his hypertension."  
FOF 12 and 14 are supported by the opinions of several 
doctors. Dr. Ronald A. Morton indicated Ihara could return to 
regular duty work. Dr. Ajit S. Arora opined Ihara's 
hypertension was "never a labor disabling condition" and should 
not prevent him from returning to his regular and customary duties. Dr. Dennis B. Lind opined Ihara could obtain gainful 
employment outside of the DLNR and that he could return to 
regular duty work without functional limitations in any 
department, except that he could not work with his former DLNR 
co-workers. Dr. Jon Streltzer opined that Ihara could return to 
work within the same capabilities, but in a different setting. 
And Dr. Danilo E. Ponce confirmed Ihara's psychiatric disorder 
was in remission, he reached medical stability, "his job itself 
seemed to be the main source of his . . . injury claim," and he had "no discernible, residual, permanent psychiatric impairment" 
rating. (Emphasis omitted.) 
Because the record supports these findings, they are 
not clearly erroneous.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(3) Finally, Ihara challenges FOF 17 and COL 1. 
Limiting his argument to the 2% permanent partial disability 
rating, Ihara asserts the Board's "conclusion suggests [he] was 
able to recover 98% of his psychiatric functioning, however, 
that conclusion is clearly erroneous as all parties agreed that 
[he] was disqualified from his usual and customary work, or any 
other work at the DLNR." Ihara further argues "consideration of 
[his] ability to function away from the DLNR is erroneous." 
FOF 17 and COL 1 state: 
FOF 17: "The Board finds that Claimant has 
sustained 1% PPD of the whole person as a result of his February 1, 2007 work injury for hypertension and 2% PPD of the whole person as a result of his February 1, 2007 work injury for his psychiatric work injury." 
COL 1: "The Board concludes that Claimant sustained 1% PPD of the whole person for hypertension and 2% PPD of the whole person for his psychiatric work 
injury as a result of the work injury 
of February 1, 2007." 
The purpose of a permanent partial disability award 
"is to compensate a worker for the loss or impairment of a 
physical or mental function." Ihara v. State, Dep't of Land &
Nat. Res.
, 141 Hawai‘i 36, 42, 404 P.3d 302, 308 (2017). It is 
5   
 
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
not based on wages lost. Id."For loss or impairment of 
function that is not listed in the schedule, . . . the permanent 
partial disability is rated as a percentage of the total loss or 
impairment of a physical or mental function of the whole 
person." Id. at 43, 404 P.3d at 309; HRS § 386-32(a) (2015). 
Ultimately, it is the director of the Department of 
Labor and Industrial Relations or the Board that decides a 
permanent partial disability rating. 
141 Hawai‘i at 43, 404 P.3d 
at 309. The Board "generally places great weight upon a 
physician's initial impairment rating, but it is not the only 
component of the Board's assessment." Id.The Board also 
considers other factors, "such as whether the complainant is 
able to participate in the same types of hobbies and daily and 
work activities as prior to the accident." Id.And the Board 
may consider the inability to perform "usual and customary work activities." Id.
 at 47, 404 P.3d at 313. 
Here, the Board considered whether Ihara could 
participate in the same daily and work activities as prior to 
the accident. The Board considered Ihara's ability to function at highly intelligent work, such as teaching and practicing law, 
following the work injury. The Board credited Ihara's testimony 
that "he was able to teach at Hawaii Pacific University, serve 
on various non-profit boards, and performed legal work" 
following his work injury. The Board thus considered Ihara's 
6   
 
 
 
   
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
loss of function to be minimal, and his only restriction was to 
not work with the DLNR co-workers there at the time of his 
injury. 
Ihara has not shown that the Board violated 
constitutional or statutory provisions, exceeded its authority, 
followed unlawful procedure, clearly erred, or abused its 
discretion in arriving at a 2% permanent partial disability 
rating of the whole person for his psychiatric work injury. See
HRS § 91-14(g) (Supp. 2019). 
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the Board's 
August 21, 2019 Decision and Order.
