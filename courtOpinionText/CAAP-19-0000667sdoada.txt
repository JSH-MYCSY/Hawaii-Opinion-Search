Defendant-Appellant Marian Y. Urata as Trustee of the 
Marian Y. Urata Trust, dated June 4, 1992, and as Successor 
Trustee of the Walter M. Urata Trust, dated June 4, 1992 (Urata),

Motion for Appointment of Commissioner and Issuance of Partition 
Decree, Filed August 30, 2017; and Denying [Urata's] Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as to Count III (Partition) of Her Counterclaim filed September 25, 2017, in favor of Plaintiff-
Appellee Fasone Properties LLC (Fasone LLC).
2 Urata also 
challenges the Circuit Court's September 3, 2019 [FOFs], [COLs], 
and Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Appointment of Commissioner and Issuance of Partition Decree, Filed August 30, 2017; and Denying [Urata's] Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as to Count III (Partition) of Her Counterclaim filed September 
25, 2017 (Order for Partition). 
Urata raises three points of error on appeal, 
contending that the Circuit Court erred in entering the Order for 
Partition because: (1) the Circuit Court erred in entering FOF 5 and COLs 2-5 and by failing to determine whether it has the power in equity to order a partition in kind through the creation of a 
Condominium Property Regime (CPR); (2) the Circuit Court erred in 
concluding that the imposition of a CPR in this case would be 
impractical and greatly prejudicial to Fasone LLC; and (3) the Circuit Court erred in ordering that the subject property 
(Property) be partitioned by sale and not in kind. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to

Fasones. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we 
resolve Urata's points of error as follows: 
Since a partition action is an action in equity, we
review a partition finding under the abuse of discretion
standard. See AIG Haw. Ins. Co., Inc. v. Bateman, 82Hawai #i 453, 457, 923 P.2d 395, 399 (1996). Under the abuse 
of discretion standard, unless there is abuse, a trialcourt's discretion should not be disturbed. 
Sugarman v.
Kapu, 104 Hawai #i 119, 124, 85 P.3d 644, 649 (2004). Abuse 
is apparent when a trial court's discretion clearly exceedsthe bounds of reason or disregards rules or principles oflaw or practice to the substantial detriment of a partylitigant. Id. (quoting Indus. Mortgage Co. v. Smith, 94Hawai #i 502, 510, 17 P.3d 851, 859 (App. 2001)). In 
exercising its discretion, the court should act in theinterest of fairness and prudence, and with a just regard tothe rights of all concerned[.] Id. (quoting Brent v.Staveris Dev. Corp., 7 Haw. App. 40, 45, 741 P.2d 722, 726(1987)). 
Kimura v. Kamalo, 106 Hawai<i 501, 506-07, 107 P.3d 430, 435-36 
(2005) (quotation marks omitted). 
Urata asks this court to vacate the Order for Partition 
and Judgment and to instruct the Circuit Court to order a 
partition in kind by way of a CPR, rather than a partition by 
sale. Urata does not argue that the Circuit Court abused its 
discretion in entering the Order for Partition. Instead, Urata argues that the Circuit Court could have effectuated the 
partition otherwise, by CPR, and we should order it to do so. 
In 1974, Joseph and Sandra Fasone (the Fasones) and 
Walter and Marian Urata (the Uratas) entered into an Agreement of 
Sale (the Agreement) to purchase the Property, with the Fasones 
owning an 83% undivided interest and the Uratas owning a 17% 
undivided interest. In the Agreement, the Fasones and Uratas agreed to subdivide the Property when it became legally possible 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to do so. The Property was put in trusts, the Fasones died, and 
Walter Urata died. Marian Urata lives in one of the homes on the Property, which she has lived in for many decades. There is no dispute as to the current undivided ownership interests in the Property; Urata owns a 17% undivided interest. It is undisputed that a subdivision of the Property, as agreed to in the Agreement, is not possible. 
Here, the Circuit Court did not conclude that it did 
not have the power in equity to create a CPR. Rather, it concluded that the operative partition statute, Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS) ยง 668-7 (2016) neither mentions imposition of a 
CPR nor clearly prohibits it. This conclusion is not wrong. The 
Circuit Court declined to determine whether it had the power in equity to order the creation of a CPR because it determined that a CPR in accordance with HRS Chapter 514B "would bind the parties and limit their respective rights in a [manner] that the Court deems excessive, even if it is authorized in equity[.]" The Circuit Court noted in particular the impracticality and prejudice to Fasone LLC, the majority (83%) co-owner. 
Based upon the record before the Circuit Court, and the 
initial and ongoing obligations, interests, expenses, uncertainties, and/or risks inherent in imposing (or attempting to impose) a CPR on this particular Property in accordance with HRS Chapter 514B, and in light of the parties' respective 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
interests, we cannot conclude that the Circuit Court abused its 
discretion by ordering a partition by sale. 
Accordingly, the Circuit Court's September 3, 2019 
Judgment is affirmed.
