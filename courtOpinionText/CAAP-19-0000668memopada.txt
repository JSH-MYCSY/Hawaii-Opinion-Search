and 
DANIEL M. GLUCK, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1CC191000379) 
MEMORANDUM OPINION 
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka and Nakasone, JJ.) 
After a contested case hearing, the Hawai#i State 
Ethics Commission  determined that Rowena Akana violated the 
Hawai#i code of ethics and imposed an administrative fine. Akana 
appealed. The Circuit Court of the First Circuit affirmed.  
Akana filed this secondary appeal. We affirm. 1 
I. BACKGROUND2 
Akana was an elected member of the Board of Trustees of 
the Office of Hawaiian Affairs ( OHA). She had served as an OHA 
1 The Honorable James H. Ashford presided. 
2 Some of the background comes from the Commission's findings of
fact which Akana has not challenged on appeal. See Poe v. Haw. Lab. Rels. 
Bd.
, 97 Hawai#i 528, 536, 40 P.3d 930, 938 (2002) ("Unchallenged findings are
binding on appeal." (citation omitted)). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
trustee for 28 years, until 2018. OHA trustees receive a salary 
plus an annual allowance — funded by OHA trust funds — intended to improve the trustees' ability to communicate with and help OHA beneficiaries.
3 OHA's Executive Policy Manual required that 
trustees "abide by the Standards of Conduct of the State of Hawai#i, Chapter 84, Hawaii Revised Statutes[.]" Trustees had to 
attend the ethics training course conducted by the Commission (as were legislators, members of the board of education, the governor, the lieutenant governor, and executive department heads and deputies). At least every other year, trustees were reminded 
by OHA staff or the Commission about their HRS Chapter 84 obligations. 
OHA staff gave trustees gift disclosure forms and 
reminded them of the rules about receiving and giving gifts. 
On April 19, 2018, the Commission charged Akana with 
violating Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS
) § 84-11 (the Gifts Law ), 
HRS § 84-11.5 (the Gifts Reporting Law ), and HRS § 84-13 (the
Fair Treatment Law ). These laws are part of the Code of Ethics , 
Part II of HRS Chapter 84. 
Akana denied violating the law. She 
alleged that the Commission "does not have jurisdiction over the discretionary spending accounts of the OHA Trustees, since such funds comprise 'trust funds' and do not constitute 'state funds[.]'" She also alleged that the charges violated her rights under the Hawai #i Constitution. The Commission entered the Order 
Regarding Jurisdictional and Constitutional Issues  Raised by 
Respondent. 
It concluded it had jurisdiction over the charges 
against Akana under article XIV of the Hawai #i Constitution and 
HRS Chapter 84. 
A contested case hearing was held on October 22, 24, 
25, and 26, 2018. On February 5, 2019, the Commission entered its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Decision and Order . 
It determined that Akana violated the Gifts Reporting Law, the Gifts Law, and the Fair Treatment Law. 
It imposed an

the allowance was increased to $22,200 per trustee.

administrative fine of $23,106.53. It also filed a complaint and 
referred the matter to the Attorney General. 
Akana appealed to the circuit court. She moved to stay 
enforcement of the Decision and Order. The circuit court denied the motion. She also moved to let additional evidence be presented on appeal. The circuit court denied the motion. 
On September 24, 2019, the circuit court entered an 
order affirming the Commission's Decision and Order, and a judgment. Akana's notice of appeal to this court was filed on October 1, 2019. On October 2, 2019, the Commission moved to amend the judgment. The Amended Final Judgment was entered on November 27, 2019. 
II. POINTS OF ERROR 
Akana's opening brief states nine points of error, 
which we have numbered as contemplated by Hawai#i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure ( HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4) and restated to reflect 
the secondary nature of our review: (1) the Commission exceeded 
its jurisdiction by prosecuting Akana for discretionary conduct as an OHA trustee; (2) the Commission was not authorized to adopt 
the administrative rule under which Akana was charged; (3) the 
Commission deprived Akana of due process by issuing the Order Regarding Jurisdictional and Constitutional Issues without conducting an evidentiary hearing; (4) the Commission's selective 
prosecution of Akana violated her constitutional right to equal protection; (5) the fines imposed against Akana were excessive;
(6) the Commission made erroneous findings of fact and wrong 
conclusions of law in applying the Fair Treatment Law to Akana's 
spending from her trustee allowance; (7) the Commission made 
erroneous findings and wrong conclusions in applying the Gifts Law and Gifts Reporting Law to a third party's payment of Akana's legal fees; (8) the circuit court abused its discretion by 
denying Akana's motion to stay enforcement of the Commission's Decision and Order; and (9) the circuit court erred by granting 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the Commission's motion to amend the judgment after Akana filed 
her notice of appeal. 
III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A. Administrative Agency Appeals 
Our review of the circuit court's decision on Akana's 
appeal from the Commission's Decision and Order is a secondary appeal; we determine whether the circuit court was right or wrong, applying the standards in HRS § 91–14(g) to the Commission's decision based on the agency record. Flores v. Bd. 
of Land & Nat. Res., 143 Hawai #i 114, 120, 424 P.3d 469, 475 
(2018) (citation omitted). 
HRS § 91–14(g) (Supp. 2018) provides: 
Upon review of the record, the court may affirm the
decision of the agency or remand the case withinstructions for further proceedings; or it mayreverse or modify the decision and order if thesubstantial rights of the petitioners may have beenprejudiced because the administrative findings,conclusions, decisions, or orders are: 
(1) In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; 
(2) In excess of the statutory authority orjurisdiction of the agency; 
(3) Made upon unlawful procedure; 
(4) Affected by other error of law; 
(5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,probative, and substantial evidence on thewhole record; or 
(6) Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterizedby abuse of discretion or clearlyunwarranted exercise of discretion. 
We review an agency's findings of fact for clear error. 
Del Monte Fresh Produce (Haw.), Inc. v. International Longshore 
and Warehouse Union, Local 142, 128 Hawai #i 289, 302, 287 P.3d 
190, 203 (2012). 
An agency's conclusions of law are usually 
reviewed de novo. Id. But when we review an agency's 
determination, we first examine whether the legislature granted 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the agency discretion to make the determination being reviewed. 
If the legislature granted the agency discretion over a particular matter, we review the agency's action under the deferential abuse of discretion standard (remembering the legislature determines the boundaries of that discretion). Paul's Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Befitel, 104 Hawai #i 412, 419-20, 91 
P.3d 494, 501-02 (2004). 
The legislature granted the Commission discretion to 
administer and enforce HRS Chapter 84. See Boyd v. Haw. State 
Ethics Comm'n , 138 Hawai #i 218, 225, 378 P.3d 934, 941 (2016) 
(citing HRS Chapter 84, Preamble (1993));
4 HRS § 84-1 (2012) 
("This chapter shall be liberally construed to promote high standards of ethical conduct in state government."). When we review the Commission's decision, we "cannot consider the weight of the evidence to ascertain whether it weighs in favor of the administrative findings, or review the agency's findings of fact by passing upon the credibility of witnesses or conflicts in testimony, especially the finding of an expert agency in dealing with a specialized field."

Homes, LLC , 136 Hawai #i 505, 522, 364 P.3d 213, 230 (2015)

B. Jurisdiction 
An administrative agency may determine its own 
jurisdiction. See HOH Corp. v. Motor Vehicle Indus. Licensing 
Bd., 69 Haw. 135, 141, 736 P.2d 1271, 1275 (1987). The existence of jurisdiction is a question of law we review de novo under the

The purpose of this chapter is to (1) prescribe a code of
ethics for elected officers and public employees of theState as mandated by the people of the State of Hawaii inthe Hawaii constitution, article XIV; (2) educate thecitizenry with respect to ethics in government; and(3) establish an ethics commission which will administer thecodes of ethics adopted by the constitutional convention andby the legislature and render advisory opinions and enforce
the provisions of this law so that public confidence in
public servants will be preserved.

right/wrong standard. In re Kanahele, 152 Hawai #i 501, 509, 526 
P.3d 478, 486 (2023). 
C. Statutory Interpretation 
Interpretation of a statute is a question of law 
reviewed de novo. Barker v. Young
, 153 Hawai #i 144, 148, 528 
P.3d 217, 221 (2023). We start with the statute's language; 
"implicit in the task of statutory construction is our foremost 
obligation to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the language contained in the statute itself." 
Id. (citation omitted). 
IV. DISCUSSION 
We discuss Akana's points of error in the order 
presented in her opening brief. 
A. The Commission could investigate and take
appropriate action against Akana for
violating HRS Chapter 84. 
Article XIV of the Hawai #i Constitution provides in 
relevant part: 
The people of Hawaii believe that public officers and
employees must exhibit the highest standards of ethicalconduct and that these standards come from the personalintegrity of each individual in government. To keep faithwith this belief, the legislature, each politicalsubdivision and the constitutional convention shall adopt acode of ethics which shall apply to appointed and electedofficers and employees of the State or the politicalsubdivision, respectively, including members of the boards,
commissions and other bodies. 
Each code of ethics shall be administered by a
separate ethics commission, except the code of ethics
adopted by the constitutional convention which shall beadministered by the state ethics commission. 
The code of ethics applicable to state officers and 
employees, and members of state boards, commissions and other 
bodies, is HRS Chapter 84. The Commission was established by HRS § 84-21 (2012). It may "initiate, receive, and consider charges 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
concerning alleged violation of" HRS Chapter 84, and "initiate or 
make investigation, and hold hearings[.]" HRS § 84-31(a)(3) (2012). It has "jurisdiction for purposes of investigation and taking appropriate action on alleged violations of" HRS Chapter 84. HRS § 84-31(a)(6) (2012). 
OHA was established by article XII, section 5 of the 
Hawai#i Constitution, see Arakaki v. Hawaii, 314 F.3d 1091, 1093 
(9th Cir. 2002), and created by HRS § 10-4 (1979). It is 
governed by a nine-member board of trustees, elected by qualified voters in the state. Arakaki, 314 F.3d at 1093. 
Akana was an 
elected member of OHA's board of trustees. She is subject to the 
Code of Ethics, and the Commission had authority to investigate her alleged violations of the Gifts Law, the Gifts Reporting Law, and the Fair Treatment Law. 
Akana argues she isn't subject to the Code of Ethics 
because it contradicts her obligations under HRS Chapter 10, the statute governing OHA. 
She cites Boyd, 138 Hawai#i 218, 378 P.3d 
934. There, the supreme court held that the Commission did not have authority to adjudicate conflicts-of-interest proceedings under HRS § 84-14 against Boyd, a state charter school employee. Id. at 228, 378 P.3d at 944. The charter school statute in effect at the time of the alleged violations, HRS Chapter 302B,
 
exempted charter schools "from all other State laws in conflict with Chapter 302B." Id. at 227, 378 P.3d at 943 (citing HRS § 302B–9(a) (Supp. 2006 & 2007) (repealed 2012)). The Commission found Boyd in violation of HRS § 84-14 and fined him $10,000. Id. at 228 n.24, 378 P.3d at 944 n.24. The supreme court noted Boyd was fined "for the same conduct that was in compliance with [the charter school]'s conflict of interest policy, which was adopted in accordance with HRS §§ 302B–5(d)(6) or 302B–6(d)(6)." Id.  The court held: 5
5 HRS Chapter 302B was repealed in 2012 and replaced with HRS
Chapter 302D. Boyd, 138 Hawai #i at 219 n.1, 378 P.3d at 935 n.1. Under HRS 
§ 302D–12(i) (Supp. 2012), "[a]ll charter school employees and members of
governing boards shall be subject to [HRS] chapter 84." Id. at 227 n.23, 378
P.3d at 943 n.23. 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
If both HRS § 84–14 and Chapter 302B applied to a charter
school employee during the relevant time period, then thatemployee would have been subject to two separate conflict ofinterest standards. Thus, that same employee could havebeen subject to punishment under one set of standards, butnot the other, for the same conduct. 
Id. at 228, 378 P.3d at 944. 
Akana cites HRS §§ 10-4 ("Office of Hawaiian affairs; 
established; general powers") and 10-4.5 ("Authority over 
disbursements") as the statutes that "caused conflicting standards to be applied" to her conduct. 
"Two statutes conflict 
where it is not possible to give effect to both." Carmichael v. Bd. of Land & Nat. Res., 150 Hawai #i 547, 567, 506 P.3d 211, 231 
(2022) (citation omitted). 
Nothing in HRS §§ 10-4 (2009) or 10-
4.5 (2009) is contrary to, or inconsistent with, the Code of Ethics. See Off. of Hawaiian Affs. v. Kondo, 153 Hawai #i 170, 
178, 528 P.3d 243, 251 (2023) (noting that "[g]enerally, two laws conflict when they 'are explicitly contrary to, or inconsistent with, each other.'" (quoting Boyd, 138 Hawai #i at 227, 378 P.3d 
at 943)). "[I]f laws can be interpreted harmoniously, there is no conflict." Id.  OHA's Executive Policy Manual requires that 
"Trustees shall abide by the Standards of Conduct of the State of Hawai#i, Chapter 84, Hawaii Revised Statutes, as amended, and 
shall attend ethics training as required by law." Akana's argument lacks merit. 
Akana also contends that the Commission erred because 
she "acted appropriately at all times in accordance with her fiduciary duties and capacity as trustee." She cites 
Kealoha v. 
Machado, 131 Hawai#i 62, 315 P.3d 213 (2013). The plaintiffs in 
Machado sued several OHA trustees (including Akana) for breaching 
their fiduciary duty by spending trust funds "without regard to blood quantum on lobbying efforts[.]" 
Id. at 71, 315 P.3d 
at 222. The supreme court noted that HRS Chapter 10 didn't mandate how OHA trustees should spend trust funds to better the conditions of native Hawaiians. Id. at 78, 315 P.3d at 229. "[T]he trustees have broad discretion in making that 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
determination." Id. (citation omitted). In that context, the 
court held: 
When a trustee has discretion with respect to the
exercise of a power, its exercise is subject to supervision
by a court  only to prevent abuse of discretion. Where 
discretionary power is given to the trustee, the court will
not interfere unless the trustee in exercising or failing toexercise the power acts dishonestly, or with an impropereven though not a dishonest motive, or fails to use hisjudgment, or acts beyond the bounds of a reasonablejudgment. 
Id. at 77, 315 P.3d at 228 (cleaned up) (emphasis added). 
Akana argues that a court can only review her conduct 
for breach of fiduciary duty, and "cannot interfere with an OHA 
trustee's exercise of discretionary power without first making a finding of breach of fiduciary duty." She argues that the circuit court improperly interfered by affirming the Decision and Order because neither the Commission nor the circuit court found that she abused her discretionary power. But neither the Commission nor the circuit court were tasked with determining whether Akana breached her fiduciary duty to OHA beneficiaries. They reviewed whether Akana met her obligations under the Code of Ethics, not whether she breached her fiduciary duty as an OHA trustee. Nothing in Machado  constrains the Commission from 
investigating alleged violations of the Code of Ethics, or from taking appropriate action on violations. 
Akana argues for reversal of the Commission's findings 
that she violated the Fair Treatment Law because "each and every expenditure [she] made . . . went through the approval process created by OHA and was either authorized, or was disallowed and then reimbursed by Ms. Akana in accordance with OHA policy." That, she contends, resulted "in inconsistent and conflicting standards being applied." But OHA does not pre-authorize trustee spending. The Commission found, and Akana does not challenge: 
79. Because Trustees are provided with Trustee Annual
Allowance funds in a lump sum at the beginning of thefiscal year, the OHA fiscal staff's review of aTrustee's quarterly report is an "after-the-fact" 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
review; by the time the fiscal staff receives a
quarterly report from a Trustee, the expenditureslisted in the report have already been made by theTrustee. 
. . . . 
82. The quarterly and year-end reviews of Trustee Annual
Allowance expenditures are a "tedious" and "time-consuming" process, inasmuch as OHA fiscal staffreviews each expenditure manually and it is notpossible for staff to catch all disallowedexpenditures, primarily because each Trustee isallowed to spend $22,200 annually, which includes manysmall expenditures. 
. . . . 
86. The fact that a particular expense is "not disallowed"
by OHA fiscal staff does not mean that the expenditureis "allowable" or consistent with OHA policy; it couldsimply mean that the expense was not "flagged" by thefiscal staff. As stated by former Controller Kim inhis testimony, the failure to disallow a prohibitedexpense was a deficiency in the process of reviewingthese expenditures; however, the fact that anexpenditure was not disallowed does not necessarilymean that the expenditure was allowable pursuant toOHA policy. 
. . . . 
91. The Commission finds, based upon credible evidence,
that Respondent Akana threatened and berated OHAfiscal staff who questioned or disallowed her TrusteeAnnual Allowance expenditures. Current and former OHA staff members testified that they and their colleaguesfeared personal attacks or possible retaliation whenquestioning Respondent Akana about her expenditures. 
92. OHA fiscal staff found that trying to get additionalinformation and documentation from Respondent Akanaabout her expenditures was difficult and the staff wasintimidated to ask Respondent Akana for information"because they don't want to get yelled at." 
. . . . 
96. There were many incidents that affected how [former
OHA Chief Financial Officer ( CFO)] Ms. Iona approached
Respondent Akana with respect to her Trustee Allowanceexpenditures: 
[I]t really all boils down to there was aneffort by administration to enforce policies andprocedures the best that we could. There was disagreement from trustee Rowena Akana in doingso, and that, in itself would cause a lot ofpersonal attacks against members of theadministration, including myself. And that was really the standard in really the almost sixyears that I was the CFO. 
10 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
97. Because of Respondent Akana's threats to and
intimidation of OHA fiscal staff, more than one OHAemployee was reluctant to challenge Respondent Akanaregarding her spending of Trustee Annual Allowancefunds. 
98. In January 2014, then-CFO Iona decided not to questionRespondent Akana about the purchase of a $50 iTunesgift card (Count 7, discussed at FOFs # 99-104, below)— even though Ms. Iona believed the purchase shouldnot have been allowed — expressly because Ms. Iona didnot want to upset Respondent Akana. 
(Citations to evidence omitted.) These unchallenged findings 
bind Akana. See Poe, 97 Hawai#i at 536, 40 P.3d at 938. Akana's 
argument that she could not have violated the Code of Ethics because her spending was not disallowed by OHA lacks merit. 
B. The Commission was authorized to adopt the
administrative rule under which Akana was charged. 
The charges against Akana were brought under Hawaii 
Administrative Rules ( HAR) § 21-5-2 (eff. 1981). Akana contends 
that HAR § 21-5-2 exceeds the statutory authority granted to the 
Commission. The rule provided: 
(a) Upon the receipt of anonymous information or other
information not under oath, or information obtained at the
initiative of the commission, the executive director ordelegate shall verify such facts as may be verified throughpublic documents or the assistance of department heads,legislators, or other appointed or elected officials oremployees, including the respondent. Investigation may notextend to interviews of other persons unless the commission,in its discretion, initiates an investigation to determinewhether a charge should be issued. This investigation willbe carried out confidentially by the executive director ordelegate. The nature and scope of the investigation shallbe defined by a resolution supported by a vote of three ormore members of the commission. 
(b) If after preliminary investigation at least three
commissioners decide that a charge should be initiated, the
charge shall be issued in writing and signed by at leastthree commissioners. 
Akana argues that the Commission "may only investigate 
a matter after the issuance of written charges." Her argument 
lacks merit. HRS § 84-31(a)(3) empowers the Commission to 
"initiate, receive, and consider charges concerning alleged 
11 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
violation of this chapter, initiate or make investigation , and 
hold hearings[.]" (Emphasis added.) HAR § 21-5-2 follows the 
Commission's statutory authority to "initiate or make investigation" into violations of the Code of Ethics. 
C. Akana was not deprived of due process. 
Akana contends that she "was denied due process in so 
far as she was not given an evidentiary hearing to contest the Commission's authority and jurisdiction to bring charges against her in the first place." The record does not show that Akana asked for an evidentiary hearing to determine the Commission's jurisdiction, either before or after entry of the Order Regarding Jurisdictional and Constitutional Issues. We decline to consider this argument, made for the first time on appeal. See State v. 
Moses, 102 Hawai #i 449, 456, 77 P.3d 940, 947 (2003) ("As a 
general rule, if a party does not raise an argument at trial, that argument will be deemed to have been waived on appeal; this rule applies in both criminal and civil cases." (citations omitted)). 
At any rate, the purpose of an evidentiary hearing is 
to resolve factual disputes. Safeway, Inc. v. Nordic PCL 
Constr., Inc.
, 130 Hawai#i 517, 531–32, 312 P.3d 1224, 1238–39 
(App. 2013). There were no genuine factual issues material to the Commission's authority and jurisdiction to determine whether Akana violated the Code of Ethics. Akana did not dispute she was an elected, salaried member of OHA's board of trustees. As an OHA trustee, she is subject to the Code of Ethics as a matter of law. The Commission could investigate her alleged violations of the Gifts Law, the Gifts Reporting Law, and the Fair Treatment Law, and take appropriate action. 
See HRS § 84-31(a)(3). 
D. The Commission did not violate Akana's 
constitutional right to equal protection. 
Akana contends she was selectively prosecuted in 
violation of her right to equal protection under article I, 
12 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
section 5 of the Hawai#i Constitution. She must "present 
sufficient evidence to establish the existence of intentional or 
purposeful discrimination . . . that is deliberately based upon an unjustifiable standard such as race, religion or other arbitrary classification." 
State v. Kailua Auto Wreckers, Inc. , 
62 Haw. 222, 226-27, 615 P.2d 730, 734–35 (1980) (cleaned up). Akana's briefs don't cite to any evidence presented to the Commission that supports her selective prosecution defense. 
Akana argues that she tried to present this evidence to 
the circuit court, but the court denied her motion to present new evidence. 
Her motion cited HRS § 91-14(e) (2012), which lets the 
circuit court order that new evidence be presented to the agency , 
which may then change its findings, decision, and order. Akana's motion sought to present new evidence "to this [Circuit] Court on appeal." This procedure is not allowed by HRS § 91-14(e). See 
also HRS § 91-14(f) (Supp. 2018) ("The review shall be . . . confined to the record[.]"). The circuit court did not err by denying Akana's motion. 
In this secondary appeal, Akana argues that the new 
evidence she sought to present (to the circuit court) would have shown that the Commission "had no rational basis to proceed solely against Ms. Akana for the exact same types of transactions made by other OHA trustees during the same time period, and therefore the Commission's prosecution was unlawful and violated Ms. Akana's equal protection rights." "It is insufficient to show merely that other offenders have not been prosecuted[.]" Kailua Auto Wreckers , 62 Haw. at 227, 615 P.2d at 735 (citation 
omitted). Akana makes a conclusory argument that "a group of OHA trustees and members of the OHA Board who were politically opposed to" her persuaded the Commission to "bring a retaliatory action against" her. She presented no such evidence to the Commission. Akana's contention of selective prosecution lacks merit. 
13 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
E. The fines imposed were not unconstitutionally
excessive. 
The Commission fined Akana $23,106.52 for 47 violations 
of the Code of Ethics. Akana argues that "a $1,000.00 fine, or 
any fine at all beyond a nominal one,  is excessive" because her 
spending violations "were either approved by OHA itself or else promptly reimbursed to OHA in accordance with internal OHA protocols." We've already dismissed Akana's argument that she could not have violated the Code of Ethics because her spending was "authorized" or "not disallowed" by OHA. 
The Commission found and concluded: 
IV. ADMINISTRATIVE FINE 
. . . . 
5. The Commission concludes that Respondent Akana's
failure to report gifts totaling more than $50,000from Ms. [Abigail] Kawananakoa constituted violationsof the State Ethics Code, and that each violationwarrants the maximum administrative fine of $500 applicable at the time the offenses occurred. 
6. The Commission concludes that Respondent Akana'sreceipt of gifts totaling more than $21,000 fromMs. Kawananakoa on or about April 28, 2017 andJune 17, 2017 constituted violations of the StateEthics Code, and that each violation warrants themaximum administrative fine of $500 applicable at thetime the offense occurred. 
7. The Commission concludes that Respondent Akana'sexpenditure of her Trustee Annual Allowance for herHawaiian Airlines Premier Club membership, politicalcontributions — including the political actioncommittee event — and home cable television service constituted violations of the State Ethics Code, andthat each violation warrants the maximum administrative fine applicable at the time the offenseoccurred. 
8. Regarding Respondent Akana's expenditures on food: theCommission concludes that it is proper for RespondentAkana to pay an administrative fine equivalent to theamount of each expenditure, essentially requiringRespondent Akana to use personal funds to pay forthese expenditures. 
The Commission has taken this 
approach in similar cases. Regarding RespondentAkana's expenditure for food for OHA Trustees' holidayparty (Count 48) — an expenditure that was disallowedby OHA, such that Respondent Akana eventually usedpersonal funds to pay for the expenditure — noadministrative fine will be imposed. 
14  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
9. Upon consideration of the evidence and the arguments
of counsel, the Hawaii State Ethics Commission herebydetermines and concludes that the followingadministrative fines for each of the violations of HRS chapter 84 that occurred are appropriate and shall beassessed: 
a. Counts 1-4 (Failure to Report Gifts): $500 each

10. Contrary to Respondent Akana's assertion that anyadministrative penalties assessed against her would beexcessive, the Commission finds that the maximumadministrative penalties imposed above are appropriatein light of the breadth and egregious nature ofRespondent Akana's conduct. The evidence established that Respondent Akana committed dozens of violationsof the State Ethics Code by accepting illegal giftsvalued at over $21,000; failing to timely report giftsvalued at over $50,000; and using Trustee Annual 
15 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Allowance funds for her own personal benefit or for
political contributions. 
11. The administrative penalties imposed above areappropriate given the especially troubling actions ofthe Respondent with respect to the use of her TrusteeAnnual Allowance. Because OHA staff who administered the Trustee Annual Allowance were fearful of personalattacks and threats for questioning Respondent'sexpenditures, it cannot be said that any expenditurethat was "not disallowed" complied with OHA's ownpolicies. Indeed, Respondent Akana seeminglydisplayed a "pattern of consistently trying to getaway with spending that a prudent person would nototherwise be able to push that boundary." 
(Citations omitted.) 
Akana argues that her "belated reporting of 'gifts' of 
legal fees" was "purely a technical violation." The Commission 
addressed that issue: 
III. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 
. . . . 
76. The Commission disagrees that Respondent Akana's
failure to report four gifts (amounting to over$50,000) from Ms. Kawananakoa is a "technical"violation warranting only a "nominal penalty perinstance" or that "any fine at all[] is excessive whenconsidering the nature of the alleged violations[.]" 
77. Respondent Akana's failure to report the gifts thatshe received from Ms. Kawananakoa are not mere "technical" violations. 
Gifts [sic] disclosures serve
the vital purposes of government transparency andaccountability. They provide the Commission and thepublic with information needed to hold governmentemployees to the highest ethical standards. As reflected in the legislative history of HRS § 84-11.5,gifts [sic] disclosures may be a slight inconveniencefor filers, but they are necessary  to promote public
confidence in government and in public officials. 
78. Had Respondent timely filed her gifts disclosurestatements by the June 30, 2016 deadline, theCommission and the public would have had thisinformation a year earlier. Calling this a"technical" violation entirely misses the point of theGifts Reporting law. 
. . . . 
81. The Commission concludes that the maximum fine of $500 per violation (Counts 1-4) applicable at the time ofRespondent Akana's misconduct is consistent withapplicable law and appropriate. 
16 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(Citations omitted.) 
The Commission's fine of $500 for each violation was 
authorized by HRS § 84-39 (2012).6 Akana has not challenged the 
constitutionality of that statute. The Commission's 
characterization of Akana's conduct was supported by substantial evidence and was not clearly erroneous. Given the record here, we cannot say the Commission abused its discretion by imposing the maximum administrative fines allowed under HRS § 84-39 (2012). 
F. The Commission's findings and conclusions
about Akana's spending were supported bysubstantial evidence and were neither clearlyerroneous nor wrong. 
OHA trustees receive their allowance as a lump sum at 
the beginning of each fiscal year. OHA's Board of Trustees sets 
policies for the trustees' use of their allowance. OHA's Executive Policy Manual states that the allowance is "not intended to be used for personal gain by a Trustee[.]" (Underscoring omitted.) OHA's Trustee Scholarship and Annual Allowance Fund ( TSAAF) Handbook states that political 
contributions are not allowed. Trustees must submit quarterly spending reports; OHA's controller reconciles the reports and works with the trustees to clear any discrepancies. At the end of the fiscal year, any unspent allowance must be returned to OHA. If OHA disallows a trustee's spending, the amount is added to what that trustee must repay to OHA at the end of the fiscal year. The quarterly and fiscal-year-end reviews are tedious and time-consuming because OHA staff manually review each expenditure, many of which are small in amount, and it is impossible to catch all improper spending. Thus, a particular expense not being disallowed does not mean it was a proper use of the trustee's allowance. 
6 HRS § 84-39 was amended in 2017 to increase the maximum
administrative fine to $1,000 per violation. 2017 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 50, § 1
at 305.

The Fair Treatment Law provided, in relevant part: 
No . . . employee shall use or attempt to use the . . .
employee's official position to secure or grant unwarranted 
privileges , exemptions, advantages, contracts, or treatment,
for [the employee] or others[.] 
HRS § 84-13 (2012) (emphasis added). 
Akana argues that the Commission applied the wrong 
standard to determine what constituted "unwarranted" privileges. 
She contends she may use her trustee allowance in ways she felt would help OHA or its beneficiaries. She conflates her fiduciary duty as an OHA trustee with her obligations under the Code of Ethics. She again cites Kealoha v. Machado
, 131 Hawai#i 62, 315 
P.3d 213 (2013). As we previously stated, 
Machado does not 
constrain the Commission from investigating alleged violations of the Code of Ethics by OHA trustees, or from taking appropriate action on violations. 
1. Hawaiian Airlines Premier Club Membership.  Akana 
challenges the Commission's decision on Count 8, which charged: 
53. Respondent AKANA, by using Trustee Annual
Allowance funds to purchase a Premier Club membership with
Hawaiian Airlines costing $249.00, used or attempted to useher official position to secure an unwarranted personalbenefit for herself, in violation of HRS § 84-13 (COUNT 8). 
Akana argues she believed her purchase "was in the best 
interests of the OHA beneficiaries" because it "would save money 
for the trust over time[.]" She also argues that she paid the $249 back after OHA disallowed the expense. She does not challenge these findings and conclusions: 
II. FINDINGS OF FACT 
. . . . 
105. On or about July 15, 2014, Respondent Akana used $249
of Trustee Annual Allowance funds to purchase a
Hawaiian Airlines Premier Club membership (hereinafter"Premier Club membership"). 
106. Benefits of the Premier Club membership included
access to Hawaiian Airlines' airport Premier Clubs, 
18 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
priority check-in and boarding, complimentary
"Unlimited TV & More Pack" on certain flights to andfrom the mainland, and two free checked bags. 
107. OHA had allowed Trustees to purchase Premier Club
memberships in the past, but a former [Board ofTrustees ( BOT)] Chair stopped the practice before
Respondent Akana purchased her Premier Club membershipin 2014. 
. . . . 
110. Respondent Akana claimed that she saved OHA money by
paying for her Premier Club membership. 
111. At the hearing, Respondent's attorney argued that
Respondent Akana saved money by paying for her Premier
Club membership rather than paying baggage fees forthree or four bags each way. 
112. OHA's corporate account with Hawaiian Airlines
permitted each OHA traveler — including OHA Trustees —to take one free checked bag. 
113. The Premier Club membership permitted two free checked
bags - only one more free bag than already allowed byOHA's corporate account with Hawaiian Airlines. 
. . . . 
115. Notwithstanding her knowledge that OHA's policy
regarding Premiere [sic] Club membership had changed,
Respondent Akana never consulted with the OHA fiscaloffice about her purchase of a Premier Club membershipfor herself. 
. . . . 
III. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 
. . . . 
102. Respondent Akana purchased the Premier Club membership
knowing that it was disallowed . She informed the 
Commission that she was aware that the practice ofTrustees being allowed to purchase this membership hadpreviously ended under a prior BOT Chairperson. Even though this expenditure was disallowed by OHA, suchthat Respondent Akana eventually used personal fundsto reimburse OHA for this purchase, she expendedTrustee Annual Allowance funds on this purchase andsubmitted a quarterly report to OHA in which shesought to have this purchase offset against herTrustee Annual Allowance balance. 
(Citations to evidence omitted.) 
19 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Akana challenges these findings and conclusions: 
II. FINDINGS OF FACT 
. . . . 
116. The Commission finds that Respondent Akana used or
attempted to use her Trustee Annual Allowance for herpersonal benefit by purchasing a Premier Clubmembership for herself. 
. . . . 
III. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 
. . . . 
101. Although Respondent Akana maintains that she purchasedthe Hawaiian Airlines Premier Club membership to savemoney on baggage fees, Respondent Akana was alreadyentitled to one free bag when she traveled on HawaiianAirlines through OHA's corporate account. 
The Premier 
Club membership allowed Respondent Akana to enjoy theother personal benefits of membership — such as accessto the airline's club lounge and complimentary"Unlimited TV & More Pack" on certain flights —conferring an unwarranted benefit upon her. 
These findings and conclusions are supported by substantial 
evidence in the record and by the Commission's unchallenged findings, and reflect an application of the correct rule of law. The Commission did not abuse its discretion on this issue. 
2. Cable Television Bills.  Akana challenges the 
Commission's decisions on Counts 10 and 12-36, which charged: 
56. Respondent AKANA, by using Trustee Annual
Allowance funds to pay the total amount of Oceanic's monthly
bill for the Surf Pak Xtra package on or about each of thedates listed below, where the approximate monthly cost ofthe type of internet service she used was under $50.00, usedor attempted to use her official position to secureunwarranted personal benefits for herself — that is, homecable television service — in violation of HRS § 84-13:

Allowance funds of $80.00 or $82.00 on or about each of the 
dates listed below to pay a portion of Oceanic's orSpectrum's total monthly bill for the Surf Pak Xtra package,purportedly, for home internet service, when the approximatemonthly cost of the type of internet service she used wasunder $50.00, used Trustee Annual Allowance funds to partlypay for home cable television service. Respondent AKANA'sactions constituted the use or attempted use of her officialposition to secure unwarranted personal benefits for herself— that is, home cable television service — in violation ofHRS § 84-13: 
a. December 21, 2016 (used $80.00 to payOceanic) (COUNT 23);

n. December 30, 2017 (used $80.00 to pay

Akana argues she "made proper discretionary decisions 
to spend monies on OHA-related communications and to gain a 
broader understanding of Hawaiian issues for in [sic] her role as an OHA Trustee via watching CNN, Olelo and other news programs." 
Akana does not challenge these findings: 
117. In 2015 to 2017, Respondent Akana subscribed to a home
cable television and internet bundled service package
called "Surf Pak Xtra," offered by Oceanic Time WarnerCable ("Oceanic"), a company that was rebranded as"Spectrum" in or around 2017. 
118. The Surf Pak Xtra package consisted of standard
television service as well as access to additional channels, and "Extreme Internet" service. 
119. In 2015 and 2016, Respondent Akana used Trustee Annual
Allowance funds to pay the entire amount of hermonthly bills from Oceanic for the Surf Pak Xtrapackage. 
. . . . 
124. Respondent Akana used her Trustee Annual Allowance to
pay the entire amount of her monthly Oceanic cablebill on or about the following dates, withoutreimbursing OHA or the Trustee Annual Allowance fundfor the portion related to her home cable televisionservice: 
a. November 20, 2015 ($127.90) (Count 10). 
b. January 22, 2016 ($127.90) (Count 12). 
c. February 15, 2016 ($135.78) (Count 13). d. March 5, 2016 ($132.43) (Count 14). e. April 10, 2016 ($134.37) (Count 15). f. May 9, 2016 ($133.55) (Count 16). 
g. June 6, 2016 ($133.55) (Count 17). 
h. June 30, 2016 ($133.55) (Count 18). 
. . . . 
22 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
130. On August 8, 2016, Respondent Akana used Trustee
Annual Allowance funds to pay for her entire Oceanic
cable bill ($133.55) (Count 19). 
131. On September 5, 2016, Respondent Akana used Trustee
Annual Allowance funds to pay for her entire Oceaniccable bill ($133.55) (Count 20). 
132. Respondent Akana submitted her quarterly report for
July 1, 2016 - September 30, 2016 on October 7, 2016;Respondent Akana's quarterly report included theAugust 8, 2016 and September 5, 2016 payments toOceanic. 
. . . . 
134. [OHA] CEO [Kamana #opono] Crabbe's [October 17, 2016]
memorandum explained: "Standard TV, Digital VarietyPak, 2-Way Addressable Box is not consideredcommunications to constituents. 
Only internet is
allowed under the TSAAF. Based on inquiry withOceanic customer service the breakdown of internet charge is $47.89 (Internet $42.07 + Olelo CapitalFunding $0.26 + Cable franchise fee $3.58 + State GET$1.98)." 
135. OHA fiscal staff determined that OHA policy only
allowed Respondent Akana to use her Trustee AnnualAllowance to pay $47.89 for her monthly home internetservice from Oceanic. 
136. The portion of the Oceanic bill not attributable to
Respondent Akana's home internet service wasdisallowed by OHA fiscal staff because those Oceanicservices were for the personal benefit of RespondentAkana. 
. . . . 
148. On or about October 22, 2016 and November 24, 2016,
Respondent Akana made payments of $136.83 — the fullamount of her monthly bill for the Surf Pak Xtrapackage, including her home cable television service —to Oceanic (Counts 21 and 22). 
149. The checks for these expenditures were drawn from the
same bank account as Respondent's previousexpenditures to pay for her Oceanic cable bills. 
150. On the memo line of the check pertaining to the
November 24, 2016 expenditure is a handwritten notethat says "allowable." 
151. Despite receiving notification from CEO Crabbe on
October 17, 2016 and November 21, 2016 thatexpenditures on cable television service would bedisallowed and that internet service could be claimed at only $47.89, Respondent Akana claimed $80.00
 of 
Trustee Annual Allowance funds when she submitted her quarterly report for the October 2016 and November2016 expenditures. 
23 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
152. Respondent Akana was charged with using her Trustee
Annual Allowance to pay the entire amount ($136.83) of
her Oceanic cable bills on October 22, 2016 (Count 21)and November 24, 2016. (Count 22). Respondent Akanaappears to have initially paid for the entire amountof both bills with funds from a checking account usedby Respondent for her previous Trustee AnnualAllowance expenditures. However, at a later date,Respondent Akana claimed $80 of Trustee AnnualAllowance funds for each of those payments. 
153. Although Respondent used her Trustee Annual Allowance
to pay $80 and not $136.83 to Oceanic on October 22,2016 (Count 21) and November 24, 2016 (Count 22), thisamount was still more than Respondent was allowed toclaim for her home internet service. 
154. On or about December 21, 2016, Respondent Akana again
used Trustee Annual Allowance funds to pay $80.00 toOceanic (Count 23). 
. . . . 
160. In documentation attached with the December 21, 2016
Oceanic expenditure (Count 23), there appears to be a
printout of a screen shot of the Oceanic websitelisting three options for internet service: "Extreme"Internet - 100/10 Mbps - for $29.95 a month, "Ultimate200" Internet - 200/20 Mbps - for $39.99 a month; and"Ultimate 300" Internet - 300/20 Mbps - for $59.99 amonth. 
161. Just below this screen shot appears a handwritten
note: 
4/5/17  $59.99 monthly rate
+$10.00 modem lease +$10.00 estimated taxes $79.99 
162. This handwritten note provides the only possible basis
on which Respondent Akana may have determined that shecould use $80 a month of Trustee Annual Allowance funds (rather than $47.89 a month) for her homeinternet service. However, as set forth above,Complainant introduced competent and substantialevidence that the cost of home internet service was less than $50 a month, and Respondent Akana did notpresent any evidence to contradict Complainant'sevidence. 
163. Moreover, this screenshot and handwritten note below
the screenshot do not support Respondent Akana'sclaims for $80.00 a month for home internet service. As part of the Surf Pak Xtra package, Respondent Akanareceived "Extreme Internet" — the lowest level of internet service, offered at $29.95 a month. Thus, ifRespondent Akana was, in fact, using $59.99 a month asa baseline for her home internet service, it wouldmean she was using an artificially high baseline — themost expensive internet service ("Ultimate 300" at$59.99 a month), rather than the less expensive 
24 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
service she was actually receiving ("Extreme" at
$29.95 a month). 
. . . . 
166. Between January 2017 and December 2017, Respondent
Akana continued to use Trustee Annual Allowance funds 
to pay approximately $80 — for her home internetservice and to subsidize her home cable television service, without reimbursing OHA or the Trustee AnnualAllowance fund for such expenditures: 
a. January 20, 2017 ($80) (Count 24). b. February 13, 2017 ($80) (Count 25). c. March 15, 2017 ($80) (Count 26). d. April 20, 20017 [sic] ($80) (Count 27). e. May 20, 2017 ($80) (Count 28). f. 
June 25, 2017 ($80) (Count 29). 
g. July 21, 2017 ($80) (Count 30). h. August 24, 2017 ($80) (Count 31). i. 
September 10, 2017 ($82) (Count 32). 
j. October 10, 2017 ($80) (Count 33). k. November 20, 2017 ($80) (Count 34). 1. December 13, 2017 ($80) (Count 35). m. December 30, 2017 ($80) (Count 36). 
(Footnotes and citations to evidence omitted.) 
Akana challenges these findings and conclusions: 
II. FINDINGS OF FACT 
. . . . 
120. OHA policy (stated in the 2013 Amendment to the
Executive Policy Manual) allowed Trustee AnnualAllowance funds to be used for expenses forcommunications with constituents. 
Thus, internet
service was an allowed expense. However, the policydid not provide for home cable television service asan allowable expense. 
121. The Commission finds that Respondent Akana's testimonythat she very rarely watched television or mostlywatched Olelo or the news is not  a sufficient 
justification to use her Trustee Annual Allowance topay for her home cable television service. Instead,the Commission finds that Respondent Akana's homecable television service was a personal benefit toRespondent. 
25 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
122. Respondent Akana's use of Trustee Annual Allowance
funds to pay the entire amount of her monthly Oceanicbill was not allowable under OHA policy because theOceanic bill included charges for home cabletelevision service, which was a personal benefit toher. 
. . . . 
125. For each of the transactions listed above (relating toCount 10 and Counts 12-18), the Commission finds thatRespondent Akana used her Trustee Annual Allowance forher personal benefit by paying for her home cabletelevision service. 
. . . . 
147. For the August 8, 2016 and September 5, 2016transactions (relating to Counts 19 and 20), theCommission finds that Respondent Akana used orattempted to use her Trustee Annual Allowance for herpersonal benefit by paying for her home cabletelevision service. 
. . . . 
164. As such, in each of the months in which Respondentused more than $47.89 of Trustee Annual Allowance funds to pay her Oceanic bill, the Commission findsthat Respondent was using Trustee Annual Allowancefunds to subsidize her purchase of home cabletelevision service — despite previously being informedby OHA staff that she was allowed to claim only $47.89for internet service. 
Thus, she received an
unwarranted benefit of approximately $32.11 per month($80.00 - $47.89). 
165. By using $80.00 a month of Trustee Annual Allowancefunds to pay her Oceanic bill, Respondent Akana alsofailed to comply with the directive from CEO Crabbethat Trustee Annual Allowance funds not be used for home cable television service. 
. . . . 
167. For each of the transactions listed above (relating toCounts 21-36), the Commission finds that RespondentAkana used her Trustee Annual Allowance for her own personal benefit by subsidizing her payments for herhome cable television service. 
. . . . 
III. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 
. . . . 
106. Respondent Akana used or attempted to use her officialposition to secure unwarranted personal benefits forherself — that is, home cable television service — inviolation of HRS § 84-13 by paying for or attemptingto pay for all or some of the monthly charges for 
26 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Respondent's home cable television service with
Trustee Annual Allowance funds on or about each of the dates listed below: 
a. November 20, 2015 (Count 10);

107. 
Even though the August 8, 2016 (Count 19) and
September 5, 2016 (Count 20) expenditures were
disallowed in part by OHA, such that Respondent Akanaeventually used personal funds to pay for a portion ofthese purchases, Respondent submitted a quarterlyreport to OHA in which she sought to have these 
27 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
purchases offset against her Trustee Annual Allowance
balance. Her attempts to use Trustee Annual Allowancefunds to confer a personal benefit upon herself areviolations of the Fair Treatment Law. 
108. Each expenditure made by Respondent Akana out of theTrustee Annual Allowance for home television service constitutes a separate violation of HRS § 84-13. 
109. There is no evidence to suggest that Respondent Akanareimbursed OHA or the Trustee Annual Allowance fund for any of these purchases of home cable televisionservice, other than her eventual use of personal fundsto pay for a portion of the August 2016 and September2016 purchases. However, even if Respondent Akana hadreimbursed OHA or the Trustee Annual Allowance fund,each attempt  by Respondent Akana to use her official
position to make the above-referenced purchases ofhome cable television service using Trustee AnnualAllowance funds constitutes a violation of HRS § 84-13. 
110. The Commission concludes that the violations in Counts 21-36 are especially troubling. Respondent Akanacontinued to claim $80 for reimbursement for internet service even after being informed by OHA staff thatshe was only allowed to claim $47.89. In other words,Respondent Akana dishonestly continued to claim $80for internet service knowing that she was not entitledto reimbursement from her Trustee Allowance for this amount. 
(Citations to evidence omitted.) 
The Commission's findings and mixed findings and 
conclusions are supported by substantial evidence in the record, 
including testimony by OHA's controller Gloria Li, OHA's former chief financial officer Hawley Iona, and OHA's former controller John Kim, all of whom the Commission found to be credible. They are also supported by the Commission's unchallenged findings. They were not clearly erroneous, and reflect an application of the correct rule of law. They will not be overturned. See Est. of Klink ex rel. Klink v. State, 113 
Hawai#i 332, 351, 152 P.3d 
504, 523 (2007). The Commission did not abuse its discretion in deciding that Akana using her trustee allowance to pay for her home cable television service was an unwarranted privilege.
3. Food Purchases.  Akana challenges the Commission's 
decisions on Counts 38 through 48, which charged: 
28 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
62. Respondent AKANA, by using Trustee Annual
Allowance funds on or about each of the following dates, for
the purposes and in the amounts stated below, to pay forfood or meals for her [sic] herself and/or OHA Trusteesand/or OHA staff, used or attempted to use her officialposition to secure unwarranted personal benefits for OHApersonnel, including herself, in violation of HRS § 84-13: 
. . . . 
b. March 17, 2014, refreshments for staff,
from Leonard's Bakery, $17.80 (COUNT 38); 
c. July 3, 2014, food for a "going away
party" for a staff member, from 1132 Cafe& Catering, $268.59 (COUNT 39); 
d. August 4, 2014, breakfast for staff, from
Liliha Bakery, $31.94 (COUNT 40); 
e. February 10, 2015, food for a staff
"birthday celebration," from Zippy'sNimitz, $61.83 (COUNT 41); 
f. January 23, 2015, manapua for staff, from
Royal Kitchen, $66.49 (COUNT 42); 
g. July 9, 2015, food for a staff meeting,
from Liliha Bakery, $39.48 (COUNT 43); 
h. December 2, 2015, food for staff from
Chinatown Express Ala Moana, $31.01 (COUNT44); 
i. August 15, 2016, refreshments for staff
from Leonard's Bakery, $20.73 (COUNT 45); 
j. October 5, 2016, lunch for staff from
Tanaka Saimin, $43.66 (COUNT 46); 
k. February 17, 2017, the cost of food that
had been purchased for a party for a staffmember's "last day," $25.00 (COUNT 47);and 
l. December 5, 2017, noodles from Royal
Kitchen for a "pot luck" OHA Trustees'holiday party, $23.72 (COUNT 48). 
Each expenditure made by Respondent AKANA out of
Trustee Annual Allowance funds to pay for food [for]herself, other OHA Trustees, and/or OHA staff constituted aseparate violation of HRS § 84-13. 
Akana argues that she may use her trustee allowance to 
buy food for staff meetings and for functions where OHA work was 
done or where OHA beneficiaries attended. She challenges these findings: 
29 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
174. OHA fiscal staff's understanding of the policy was
that Trustees could spend Trustee Allowance funds onfood for meetings with outside beneficiaries, but notfor internal meetings with staff. As former Controller Kim explained, "we looked for some kind oflink that established [that trustees were] workingwith either beneficiaries or constituents or some kind of other partners that we would typically work with." 
175. Trustee food expenditures for staff meetings could bepermissible under the policy if there was a "clearbusiness purpose" for the meeting, such as bringing inlunch to a remote location during a staff retreat, andif the expenditure amount was reasonable. 
176. However, a Trustee's notation that Trustee AnnualAllowance funds were used for a "staff lunch" would not be sufficient to justify a food expenditurebecause such a notation would not indicate a clear business need for the expenditure. 
177. Expenditures for purely internal functions, includinga staff birthday party or a going-away party for astaff member, would typically be disallowed under OHApolicy. 
(Brackets in original) (citations to evidence omitted). OHA's 
Trustee Allowance Meal Form cites to the Board of Trustees Executive Policy Section 3.5.n, which lets trustees use their allowance to cover "associated costs to attend conferences, seminars or meetings[.]" OHA's Trustee Sponsorship and Allowance Fund Internal Guidelines and Procedures lists permissible spending to include: (a) developing and maintaining an ongoing communication network with beneficiaries and the general public; (b) promoting a broader understanding of Hawaiian issues within the Hawaiian community and among the general public to encourage participating in the resolution of those issues; (c) covering costs of social and charitable functions a trustee is expected to support, including sponsoring or assisting a faith based organization's halau, youth group, extracurricular after school activities and sports activities that do not involve religious practices or activities; (d) covering official travel, registration fees, and associated costs to attend conferences, seminars or meetings; (e) providing support for beneficiaries in their personal quest for self-improvement, capacity building, and education; (f) providing funds to purchase school and educational

supplies and materials, audio-visual presentation equipment, and 
capacity building aids for schools and organizations; and (g) providing compassionate help to beneficiaries and their families for emergencies, natural disasters, and other times of need. 
On Count 38, the Commission found the "purchase of 
refreshments for a staff meeting was a personal expense rather than an expense that was necessary or required for OHA business." On Count 39, the Commission found the "purchase of food for a staff 'going away' party or for 'morale building' was a personal expense rather than an expense that was necessary or required for OHA business." On Count 40, the Commission found the "purchase of refreshments for a staff meeting was a personal expense rather than an expense that was necessary or required for OHA business." On Count 41, the Commission found the "purchase of food for a birthday lunch celebration for staff or for 'morale building' was a personal expense rather than an expense that was necessary or required for OHA business." On Count 42, the Commission found the "purchase of food for an internal staff meeting was a personal expense rather than an expense that was necessary or required for OHA business." On Count 43, the Commission found the "purchase of food for an internal staff meeting was a personal expense rather than an expense that was necessary or required for OHA business." On Count 44, the Commission found the "purchase of food for an internal staff meeting was a personal expense rather than an expense that was necessary or required for OHA business." On Count 45, the Commission found the "purchase of refreshments for staff was a personal expense rather than an expense that was necessary or required for OHA business." On Count 46, the Commission found the "purchase of lunch for an internal staff meeting was a personal expense rather than an expense that was necessary or required for OHA business." On Count 47, the Commission found the "purchase of lunch for a staff member's last day at work or for 'morale building' was a personal expense rather than an expense that was necessary or 
31 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
required for OHA business." On Count 48, the Commission found 
the "purchase of food for a [Board of Trustees] staff holiday party or for 'morale purposes' was a personal expense rather than an expense that was necessary or required for OHA business." These findings were supported by substantial evidence and were not clearly erroneous. 
The Commission found and concluded: 
111. Although OHA policy relating to the purchase of food
with Trustee Annual Allowance funds was not the model of clarity, substantial evidence was adduced thatTrustees were not allowed to spend Trustee AnnualAllowance funds on staff parties, or on purelyinternal meetings absent some documented need to doso. 
112. Even if OHA policy allowed Trustees to use TrusteeAllowance funds for food expenditures withoutrestriction, the State Ethics Code does not. The Fair Treatment law does not permit an employee to use herofficial position to obtain unwarranted benefits forherself or anyone else. The Fair Treatment law prohibits Trustees from using Trustee Allowance fundsfor food expenditures to obtain unwarranted personalbenefits for themselves or other OHA employees. 
113. Respondent Akana used her Trustee Allowance topurchase refreshments or lunches for herself and herstaff. Such expenditures are generally consideredpersonal expenses for state employees unless they arenecessary for state business. In this case, the FairTreatment law prohibited Respondent's expenditures ofTrustee Allowance funds for personal purchases of foodfor herself and her staff unless the expenditures werenecessary or required for state (i.e., OHA) business. 
114. The Commission understands that Hawaii has a cultural practice of using food to express appreciation andAloha. The State Ethics Code does not prohibit OHAemployees from purchasing food to share with workcolleagues. However, Trustees seeking to purchasefood as an expression of appreciation to OHA staffshould make these purchases using personal fundsrather than the OHA Trustee Allowance, which isspecifically dedicated to benefitting Hawaiianbeneficiaries by, among other things, promoting abroader understanding of Hawaiian issues or developinga communication network with beneficiaries and the general public. Using Trustee Allowance funds topurchase food for the office without any clearbusiness need provides OHA employees with anunwarranted benefit in contravention of the Fair Treatment Law and the purpose of the Trustee Allowancefund. 
115. The Commission concludes, based upon competent andsubstantial evidence, that Respondent Akana's food 
32 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
purchases were personal expenses and were not
necessary or required for OHA business. The purchaseof pastries, coco puffs, or manapua for a staffmeeting is a personal expense rather than an expensethat is necessary for the performance of OHA business.(Counts 38, 40, 42, 43, 45). The purchase of food fora staff lunch — even if work is discussed during lunch-- is also a personal expense unless it is necessaryfor staff to perform OHA business during lunch (Counts44, 46). The Commission concludes that RespondentAkana's use of her Trustee Annual Allowance fund to pay for these personal food expenses was anunwarranted personal benefit for Respondent Akana andOHA staff. 
116. Likewise, although the Commission understands that aTrustee — or any state agency head -- may wish topromote office morale by purchasing food to celebratestaff birthdays or holiday parties, this was not anallowed expenditure under OHA policy; nor was itallowed under the State Ethics Code. These are personal expenses for which Trustee Annual Allowancefunds should not have been used. The State Ethics Code does not permit the expenditure of Trustee AnnualAllowance funds (rather than personal funds) on staffbirthday, going away, or holiday parties (Counts 39,41, 47, 48). The Commission concludes that RespondentAkana's use of her Trustee Annual Allowance fund to pay for these personal food expenses was anunwarranted personal benefit for Respondent Akana andOHA staff. 
117. The Commission is not persuaded by Respondent Akana'sattempt to justify her food expenditures by assertingthat members of her staff for whom she purchasedrefreshments and lunches were also OHA beneficiaries. The evidence clearly showed that Respondent's foodpurchases were to benefit herself and her "staff" —that is, the employees who worked for her at OHA. The evidence does not support Respondent's contention thatshe used Trustee Annual Allowance funds to purchasefood for her "staff" because they were OHAbeneficiaries. 
118. Respondent Akana used or attempted to use her officialposition to secure unwarranted personal benefits forherself and other OHA employees, in violation of HRS§ 84-13, by paying for food for herself and/or OHATrustees and/or OHA staff with Trustee AnnualAllowance funds on the following dates: 
a. March 17, 2014, "refreshments for staff
meeting," from Leonard's Bakery, $17.80 (Count38); 
b. July 3, 2014, food for a staff "going awayparty", [sic] from 1132 Café & Catering, $268.59(Count 39); 
c. August 4, 2014, food for a staff[]"workingmeeting," from Liliha Bakery, $31.94 (Count 40); 
33 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
d. February 10, 2015, food for a "birthday
celebration" for staff, from Zippy's Nimitz,$61.83 (Count 41); 
e. January 23, 2015, manapua for staff, from RoyalKitchen, $66.49 (Count 42); 
f. July 9, 2015, food for a "staff meeting," fromLiliha Bakery, $39.48 (Count 43); 
g. December 2, 2015, food for a "working lunch"with staff, from Chinatown Express Ala Moana,$31.01 (Count 44); 
h. August 15, 2016, "refreshments for staff" fromLeonard's Bakery, $20.73 (Count 45); 
i. October 5, 2016, lunch for a "staff lunch," fromTanaka Saimin, $43.66 (Count 46); 
j. February 17, 2017, the cost of food that hadbeen purchased for a staff member's "last day,"$25.00 (Count 47); and 
k. December 5, 2017, noodles from Royal Kitchen fora "pot luck" OHA Trustees' holiday party, $23.72(Count 48). 
119. Each expenditure made by Respondent Akana out ofTrustee Annual Allowance funds to pay for food forherself, other OHA Trustees, and/or OHA staffconstitutes a separate violation of HRS § 84-13. 
120. Even if one or more of these purchases had been"disallowed" by OHA, such that Respondent Akanaeventually used personal funds to pay for theexpenditures, each attempt by Respondent Akana to useher official position to make the above-referencedpurchases of food constitutes a violation of HRS§ 84-13. 
These mixed findings and conclusions are supported by 
substantial evidence in the record, and by the Commission's 
unchallenged findings. They were not clearly erroneous, and reflect an application of the correct rule of law. The Commission's findings that Akana spending her allowance on refreshments for internal staff meetings, parties, and "morale building" were for her, her staff's, and her fellow trustees' benefit, and not to benefit OHA beneficiaries, was not clearly erroneous. The Commission's conclusions that Akana's spending was an unwarranted privilege in violation of the Fair Treatment Law was not wrong, an abuse of discretion, or arbitrary or capricious.

4. Political Contributions.  Akana challenges the 
Commission's decisions on Counts 49 through 51, which charged: 
64. Respondent AKANA, by using Trustee Annual
Allowance funds to make a political contribution of $50.00
to the Hawaii County Democrats on or about February 11,2014, used or attempted to use her official position forpolitical purposes — that is, to unfairly benefit apolitical party — in violation of HRS § 84-13 (COUNT 49). 
65. Respondent AKANA, by using Trustee Annual
Allowance funds to make a political contribution of $50.00to the Democratic National Committee on or about February 11, 2014, used or attempted to use her officialposition for political purposes — that is, to unfairlybenefit a political party — in violation of HRS § 84-13(COUNT 50). 
66. Respondent AKANA, by using Trustee Annual
Allowance funds on or about December 5, 2017 to make adonation of $500.00 to pay for entertainment for the KanakaMaoli Political Action Committee event, used or attempted touse her official position for political purposes — that is,to unfairly benefit one or more political action committees— in violation of HRS § 84-13 (COUNT 51). 
Akana argues that her $50 contributions to the Hawaii 
County Democrats and the Democratic National Committee were both 
allowed by OHA, or OHA "at least allowed one and the other was repaid[.]" We've already rejected the argument that Akana could not have violated the Code of Ethics because her spending was not disallowed by OHA. 
Akana also argues that her donations were proper 
because they benefitted "social platforms" and "social events" and that her $500 contribution to Kanaka Maoli was "to pay DeMont Connor for entertainment for Kanaka Maoli, an event presented on January 16, 2018, by the 
Ho#omana Pono Political Action Committee 
and the Ka Lahui Hawai #i Political Action Committee." 
Akana does not challenge these findings:

. . . . 
277. The "Hawaii County Democrats" is affiliated with the
Democratic Party of Hawaii, a political party. 
278. Margaret Wille, the Chair of the Democratic Party for
the County of Hawaii, was called as a witness by
Respondent Akana. 
35 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
279. Every year, there is a county convention of the
Democratic Party to which all Democratic candidates
and elected officials are invited. 
280. The public is invited to attend and watch the event,
but only Democratic officials and candidates areallowed to speak: 
Q. (Respondent's Counsel) And just to beclear, it's not just all elected officialsand all candidates within the democratic party. It's bipartisan; is that accurate? 
A. (Ms. Wille) No. It's — it is democrat, alldemocrats. 
Tr. IV:617:25 - 618:10. See also Tr. IV:618:18 - 619:3 ("We don't — we don't invite — there's a republicancandidate, they're not invited to speak."). 
281. Donations received for the event are used to cover 
expenses at the event, with any extra proceeds rolledover to the next political event - such as the GrandRally the night before the primary election. 
282. At one of the Hawaii County Democrats' events, some
Republicans were handing out materials and Ms. Wille"sort of shooed them"; Republicans would not bepermitted to take over the Hawaii County Democrats'event. 
. . . . 
284. Although Respondent Akana maintains that her $50
donation to the Hawaii County Democrats was for
refreshments for the event, she reported it on herquarterly report (January 1, 2014 - March 31, 2014) asa "political contribution." 
. . . . 
Count 50 
. . . . 
290. The Democratic National Committee is a political
party. 
291. Respondent Akana's quarterly report (January 1, 2014 -
March 31, 2014) included supporting documentation forRespondent's political contribution to the DemocraticNational Committee. 
The supporting documentation
included a copy of a Democratic National Committeedonation form soliciting donations "to help take backthe House, protect our Senate majority, and wincrucial Democratic victories at all levels." 
292. Respondent Akana reported the $50 donation to the
Democratic National Committee on her quarterly reportas a "political contribution."

. . . . 
296. On or about December 5, 2017, Respondent Akana used
$500 of Trustee Annual Allowance funds to pay DeMont
Connor for entertainment for Kanaka Maoli, an eventpresented on January 16, 2018, by the Ho #omana Pono 
Political Action Committee (HPAC) (of which Mr. Connorwas President[)] and the Ka Lahui 
Hawaii# Political 
Action Committee (KPAC)[.] 
297. Respondent Akana reported the $500 payment to DeMont
Connor as a "Donation for entertainment for 01/16/18event" on her quarterly report for October 1, 2017 -December 31, 2017. 
298. Respondent Akana's Trustee Allowance Beneficiary/
Organization Donation Form described the purpose ofthe $500 donation as, "Funding For Entertainment AtJanuary 16, 2018 Event." 
299. In an email to Respondent Akana's aide Kay Watanabe,
dated November 29, 2017, DeMont Connor stated: "Alohae Kay! Here is the flyer for the event on January 16,2018. I am NOT asking funding for the political event.My request is for Entertainment." 
(Some citations to evidence omitted.) 
On Count 49, Akana challenges the Commission's finding 
that she "used her Trustee Annual Allowance to benefit a 
political party by making a political contribution to the Hawaii County Democrats on or about February 11, 2014." She acknowledges that OHA's TSAAF Handbook "states explicitly that 'political contributions' are not allowed[.]" But she argues that "the fiduciary duties given an OHA trustee take precedence over OHA internal policy or guidelines." She hasn't explained why she reasonably believed she had a fiduciary duty to give $50 to the Hawaii County Democrats, but not to any other political organization (other than the Democratic National Committee). 
The Commission found and concluded: 
123. Respondent Akana used or attempted to use her official
position to provide an unwarranted benefit to apolitical party in violation of HRS § 84-13 (Count 49)by making a political contribution of $50 to theHawaii County Democrats on or about February 11, 2014with her Trustee Annual Allowance funds (Count 49). 
. . . . 
37 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
128. One of the basic precepts of the State Ethics Code is
that state employees cannot use state resources (or inthis case, resources given to a state employee becauseof her official position) for political campaignpurposes or activities. Additionally, OHA policyclearly prohibited the use of Trustee Annual Allowancefunds for political contributions or political actioncommittee events. Thus, Respondent Akana should havebeen well aware that the use of Trustee Allowance funds for political contributions or political actioncommittee events (Counts 49-51) was prohibited. 
These mixed findings and conclusions are supported by 
substantial evidence in the record, and by the Commission's 
unchallenged findings. They were not clearly erroneous, and reflect an application of the correct rule of law. On this record, we cannot conclude that the Commission abused its discretion in determining that Akana's spending violated the Fair Treatment Law. 
On Count 50, Akana challenges the Commission's finding 
that she "used her Trustee Annual Allowance to benefit a political party by making a political contribution to the Democratic National Committee on or about February 11, 2014." She makes no specific arguments to challenge the Commission's mixed finding and conclusion: 
124. Respondent Akana used or attempted to use her official
position to provide an unwarranted benefit to apolitical party in violation of HRS § 84-13 by makinga political contribution of $50 to the DemocraticNational Committee on or about February 11, 2014 withher Trustee Annual Allowance funds (Count 50). 
We cannot conclude that the Commission abused its discretion by 
determining that Akana's spending violated the Fair Treatment Law. 
On Count 51, Akana challenges these findings and 
conclusions: 
II. FINDINGS OF FACT 
. . . . 
300. Notwithstanding Mr. Connor's statement that he was not
asking for funding for the "political event" onJanuary 16, 2018, Respondent Akana's donation toMr. Connor was for the purpose of funding 
38 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
entertainment for the event and therefore directly
benefitted the political action committee event. 
301. OHA policy prohibited the use of Trustee AnnualAllowance funds for this contribution to a politicalaction committee event. 
. . . . 
303. The Commission finds that Respondent Akana used herTrustee Annual Allowance to benefit one or more political action committees by making a contributionon or about December 5, 2017, for entertainment forthe Kanaka Maoli political action committee eventpresented by HPAC and KPAC. 
. . . . 
III. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 
. . . . 
125. Respondent Akana used or attempted to use her officialposition to provide an unwarranted benefit to one ormore political action committees in violation of HRS§ 84-13 by using Trustee Annual Allowance funds tomake a contribution of $500 on or about December 5,2017 to pay for entertainment for the Kanaka MaoliPolitical Action Committee event (Count 51). 
Akana argues her spending was for "OHA beneficiaries 
solely for entertainment purposes." Substantial evidence in the 
record shows that the entertainment for which Akana paid was part of a political event, and that trustee allowances were not to be used as "resources for the support of any political activity[.]" On this record, we cannot conclude that the Commission abused its discretion by determining that Akana's spending violated the Fair Treatment Law. 
G. The Commission's findings and conclusions
about Akana's violations of the Gifts Reporting Law and Gifts Law were supported bysubstantial evidence and were neither clearlyerroneous nor wrong. 
Counts 1 through 4 alleged that Akana violated the 
Gifts Reporting Law. The Gifts Reporting Law requires that a 
state employee file an annual disclosure statement with the Commission if: 
39 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(1) The . . . employee . . . received directly or
indirectly from one source any gift or gifts valuedsingly or in the aggregate in excess of $200, whetherthe gift is in the form of money, service, goods, orin any other form; 
(2) The source of the gift or gifts have interests thatmay be affected by official action or lack of actionby the . . . employee; and 
(3) The gift is not exempted by subsection (d) fromreporting requirements under this subsection.[
7] 
HRS § 84-11.5(a) (2012). 
Counts 5 and 6 alleged that Akana violated the Gifts 
Law. The Gifts Law provides: 
No . . . employee shall solicit, accept, or receive,directly or indirectly, any gift, . . . under circumstancesin which it can reasonably be inferred that the gift isintended to influence the . . . employee in the performanceof the . . . employee's official duties or is intended as areward for any official action on the . . . employee's part. 
HRS § 84-11 (2012). 
The Commission found, and Akana does not challenge, 
that: In 2013, Akana sued the other OHA trustees over OHA's 
practices and procedures for giving trustees and beneficiaries access to minutes and other records of executive session meetings. The trustee defendants counterclaimed against Akana for breaching her fiduciary duty and revealing privileged and confidential information. Some of Akana's legal fees were paid by Abigail Kawananakoa , an OHA beneficiary. Akana's lawsuit and 
the other trustees' counterclaim were settled in November 2017. 
7 HRS § 84-11.5(d) (2012) exempts gifts: (1) received by will or
intestate succession; (2) received from distribution of any inter vivos or
testamentary trust established by a spouse or ancestor; (3) from a spouse,fiance, fiancee, any relative within four degrees of consanguinity or thespouse, fiance, or fiancee of such a relative (but a gift from such a personis a reportable gift if the person is acting as an agent or intermediary forany person not covered by HRS § 84-11.5(d)(3)); (4) that are politicalcampaign contributions complying with state law; (5) available to ordistributed to the public generally without regard to the official status ofthe recipient; (6) that, within thirty days after receipt, are returned to thegiver or delivered to a public body or to a bona fide educational orcharitable organization without the donation being claimed as a charitablecontribution for tax purposes; and (7) of approximately equal value exchangedon holidays, birthdays, or special occasions. None of these exemptions applyin this case. 
40 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In February 2017 (while Akana's lawsuit was still pending), 
Kawananakoa sued OHA, OHA trustee and former board chair Robert K. Lindsey, and OHA chief executive officer Kamana #opono
Crabbe. Kawananakoa sought to set aside Crabbe's employment 
contract with OHA. Akana's answer to the charges admitted that Kawananakoa had interests that may have been affected by official action or lack of action by Akana, and that Akana participated in at least one OHA Board of Trustees executive session meeting about Kawananakoa's lawsuit. 
Akana challenges these findings and conclusions: 
II. FINDINGS OF FACT

III. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 
. . . . 
52. Ms. Kawananakoa had interests that may have beenaffected by official action or lack of action on thepart of Respondent Akana, which Respondent admitted inher Answer to the Further Statement of AllegedViolation. 
Further Statement ¶33; Answer ¶1 (admits
to ¶33). 
53. Ms. Kawananakoa's interests stemmed from her status as an OHA beneficiary, as the plaintiff in the 
41 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Kawananakoa v. OHA lawsuit, and as the funder of the
Akana v. OHA BOT  lawsuit (which Respondent Akana
brought in both her individual and officialcapacities). 
. . . . 
56. As the plaintiff in a lawsuit against OHA,Ms. Kawananakoa — the source of the gifts (payments oflegal fees) to Respondent Akana — had interests thatmay have been affected by official action, or lackthereof, by Respondent Akana. 
Respondent Akana, as a
member of the BOT overseeing and directing OHA, adefendant in the lawsuit, could and did participate inat least one executive session meeting in which theOHA Trustees discussed the Kawananakoa lawsuit with their legal counsel and was in a position to takeofficial action affecting Ms. Kawananakoa (such as arecommendation to settle the lawsuit). 
57. As the source of funding for the Akana v. OHA BOTlawsuit, Ms. Kawananakoa had interests that may havebeen affected — and indeed were affected — byRespondent Akana's decision (Respondent's "officialaction") to initiate and continue her lawsuit againstthe other OHA Trustees, and to defend against theother Trustees' counterclaim against her.Ms. Kawananakoa's interests stemmed from her continuing financial support for Respondent Akana'slawsuit and legal defense.

The legal fees paid by Ms. Kawananakoa to theBickerton Dang law firm for legal services provided toRespondent Akana were gifts to Respondent Akana withinthe meaning of HRS § 84-11.5; Bickerton Dang's legalservices, paid for by Ms. Kawananakoa, were"service[s]" that were "received directly orindirectly" by Respondent Akana. 
61. Each of the following payments of legal fees byMs. Kawananakoa to the Bickerton Dang law firm forlegal services provided to Respondent Akana was a giftvalued at over $200: 
a. 
July 1, 2015 ($10,478.52) (Count 1); 
b. August 10, 2015 ($9,521.48) (Count 2); c. March 24, 2016 ($6,000.00) (Count 3); d. April 19, 2016 ($24,125.50) (Count 4). 
62. None of these gifts were exempted by HRS § 84-11.5(d)
from the gifts reporting requirements. 
63. Gifts received at different times must be reportedseparately: HRS § 84-11.5 requires an individual filing a gifts disclosure statement to report "[t]hedate the gift was received[.]" HRS § 84-11.5(c)(3);see also HRS § 84-11.5(a)(l) (requires reporting of"any gift or gifts valued singly or in the aggregate 
42 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
in excess of $200, whether the gift is in the form of
money, service, goods, or in any other form"). 
64. Each payment of legal fees by Ms. Kawananakoa to theBickerton Dang law firm for legal services provided toRespondent Akana, constituted a separate and distinct,reportable gift for purposes of HRS § 84-11.5. 
65. Respondent Akana was clearly required to report eachpayment of legal fees by Ms. Kawananakoa to theBickerton Dang law firm on an annual gifts disclosurestatement filed with the Commission, by the deadlinesset forth in HRS § 84-11.5. 
66. Respondent Akana was required to reportMs. Kawananakoa's payment of legal fees on July 1,2015 ($10,478.52) by the statutory deadline of June30, 2016 (Count 1). 
67. Respondent Akana was required to reportMs. Kawananakoa's payment of legal fees on August 10,2015 ($9,521.48) by the statutory deadline of June 30,2016 (Count 2). 
68. Respondent Akana was required to reportMs. Kawananakoa's payment of legal fees on March 24,2016 ($6,000) by the statutory deadline of June 30,2016 (Count 3). 
69. Respondent Akana was required to reportMs. Kawananakoa's payment of legal fees on April 19,2016 ($24,125.50) by the statutory deadline ofJune 30, 2016 (Count 4). 
70. Respondent Akana's contention that she did not need toreport these legal fees and that they were not "gifts"because she received them in her "official capacity"is wholly without merit: if she were correct, thenstate employees could simply ignore HRS § 84-11.5altogether by claiming that gifts — whether cash,meals, tangible goods, or services — were beingprovided to them in their official capacities. This contradicts the plain language of HRS § 84-11.5. 
71. Respondent Akana accepted Ms. Kawananakoa's offer topay for her legal fees. It was incumbent uponRespondent to ascertain the value of these legal feesfor gift reporting purposes and to report these giftsin a timely fashion as required by HRS § 84-11.5. Her claim that she was not provided with copies of theBickerton Dang law firm's invoices and that, duringthe course of the litigation, she did not know thespecific amounts of her legal fees does not absolveRespondent of her responsibilities under the StateEthics Code. 
72. Respondent Akana violated HRS § 84-11.5 by failing toreport a gift (the payment of Respondent's legal fees)from Ms. Kawananakoa received on July 1, 2015($10,478.52) by the statutory deadline of June 30,2016 (Count 1). 
43 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
73. Respondent Akana violated HRS § 84-11.5 by failing to
report a gift (the payment of Respondent's legal fees)from Ms. Kawananakoa received on August 10, 2015($9,521.48) by the statutory deadline of June 30, 2016(Count 2). 
74. Respondent Akana violated HRS § 84-11.5 by failing toreport a gift (the payment of Respondent's legal fees)from Ms. Kawananakoa received on March 24, 2016($6,000.00) by the statutory deadline of June 30, 2016(Count 3). 
75. Respondent Akana violated HRS § 84-11.5 by failing toreport a gift (the payment of Respondent's legal fees)from Ms. Kawananakoa received on April 19, 2016($24,125.50) by the statutory deadline of June 30,2016 (Count 4). 
. . . . 
86. Respondent Akana's continued acceptance of gifts of
legal fees — on two occasions, totaling more than$21,000 — after Ms. Kawananakoa filed a lawsuitagainst OHA, creates a reasonable inference "that thegift is intended to influence [Respondent Akana] inthe performance of [Respondent Akana's] officialduties or is intended as a reward for any officialaction on [Respondent Akana's] part." HRS § 84-11. 
87. A reasonable person clearly could — and, theCommission believes, would — infer that a donor whopays for more than $21,000 of services to an electedofficial after suing that official's agency intends toinfluence that official. 
. . . . 
97. Respondent Akana contends that she did not violate theGifts law because she was not asked to give anythingin return for Ms. Kawananakoa's payment of legal feesand the payment of these fees did not result in anyofficial acts by Respondent benefittingMs. Kawananakoa. 
The Commission concludes that 
Respondent's contention is without merit. A donor's actual intent in giving a gift does not determinewhether a gift is prohibited by the Gifts law;similarly, it does not matter whether the giftactually influences the recipient's actions. If a gift is given under circumstances where it canreasonably be inferred  that an intent to influence or 
reward exists, the gift is prohibited. This interpretation of the Gifts law fully comports withthe plain language of the law as well as the purposeof the State Ethics Code to preserve public confidencein public officials. 
98. Respondent Akana violated HRS § 84-11 by accepting agift (the payment of Respondent's legal fees) fromMs. Kawananakoa on or about April 28, 2017($15,513.15) when the OHA BOT, including RespondentAkana, was engaged in the Kawananakoa vs. OHA  lawsuit 
(Count 5). 
44 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
99. Respondent Akana violated HRS § 84-11 by accepting a
gift (the payment of Respondent's legal fees) fromMs. Kawananakoa on or about June 17, 2017 ($6,000.00)when the OHA BOT, including Respondent Akana, wasengaged in the Kawananakoa vs. OHA  lawsuit (Count 6). 
(Citation omitted.) 
The Commission weighs three factors to determine 
whether a gift is prohibited under the Code of Ethics: (1) the 
value of the gift; (2) the relationship between the recipient and the donor, including whether the recipient takes official action regarding the donor; and (3) whether the gift benefits the recipient personally or serves legitimate state interests. Haw. 
State Ethics Comm'n Advisory Op. No. 2018-002 , 2018 WL 4599569, 
at *2 (June 21, 2018). Akana argues that she may accept Kawananakoa paying her attorneys' fees because her lawsuit against the other trustees was brought to further the interests of OHA beneficiaries. She misses the point. Kawananakoa paying Akana's attorneys' fees for her lawsuit against the other trustees could reasonably be seen as possibly influencing Akana's position on Kawananakoa's lawsuit against OHA. The value of the gift — over $70,000 — satisfies the first factor. 
Akana argues she had no significant relationship with 
Kawananakoa before Kawananakoa began paying her attorneys' fees. But this weighs against any inference that Kawananakoa paid Akana's attorneys' fees out of friendship, and supports the inference that Kawananakoa paid Akana's attorneys' fees to try to influence the positions taken by Akana in the Kawananakoa v. OHA lawsuit. Akana also argues "the unrebutted evidence [shows] that no action had ever been taken on" Kawananakoa's lawsuit. She again misses the point. Akana, as a trustee, could influence OHA's decisions on Kawananakoa's lawsuit. No action — rather than aggressive defensive action — being taken could have been the result of Akana's influence. The second factor was satisfied. 
Akana notes that the Commission made no finding on the 
third factor, because it felt the strength of the first two 
45 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
factors made the third factor inconsequential. Still, she argues 
that she did not benefit from Kawananakoa's payment of her attorneys' fees. The Commission found, and Akana doesn't challenge, that the Bickerton Dang law firm provided legal services to Akana for her lawsuit against the other trustees. Akana offered no evidence to the Commission that she would not have been personally liable for her attorneys' fees had Kawananakoa not paid them. The record indicates that the third factor was also satisfied. 
The Commission's findings, conclusions, and mixed 
findings and conclusions were supported by substantial evidence and by the Commission's unchallenged findings, and reflected a correct application of the law. They were neither clearly erroneous nor wrong. The Commission did not abuse its discretion by deciding that Akana violated the Gifts Reporting Law and the Gifts Law. 
H. Akana waived her appeal from the order
denying her motion for a stay. 
Akana contends the circuit court abused its discretion 
by denying her request for a stay pending appeal and concluding 
the factors under HRS § 91-14(c) were not met. Akana's opening brief makes no discernable argument on this point. The Commission argues the point should be deemed waived. Akana's reply brief argues the point should not be deemed waived because it involved motions briefed and argued in the circuit court, her argument on this point was referenced in her statement of the points of error, and the argument was not made in her opening brief for economy. Attempts to incorporate by reference in the opening brief arguments made before the trial court violate the 35-page limitation in HRAP Rule 28(a). Kapiolani Com. Ctr. v. 
A & S P'ship , 68 Haw. 580, 584-85, 723 P.2d 181, 184-85 (1986) 
("Since this is in violation of our rules, we will disregard those points.").

I. The circuit court retained jurisdiction to
rule on the Commission's motion to amend the judgment. 
Akana contends that her notice of appeal immediately 
divested the circuit court of jurisdiction to grant the 
Commission's motion to amend the judgment. The Commission argues this point too should be deemed waived because it was not argued in Akana's opening brief. But "lack of subject matter jurisdiction can never be waived by any party at any time." Ditto v. McCurdy , 103 Hawai #i 153, 157, 80 P.3d 974, 978 (2003) 
(citation omitted). 
The Commission's motion to amend was filed within the 
time required by Hawai #i Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 59(e). 
The circuit court's jurisdiction was extended for up to 90 days after the motion was filed. See HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) ("The 
presiding court or agency in which the motion was filed shall dispose of any such post-judgment motion by entering an order upon the record within 90 days after the date the motion was filed."). 
The circuit court retained jurisdiction to enter the 
Amended Final Judgment. 
The Amended Final Judgment substantially and materially 
altered the Final Judgment by adding fines of $23,106.53
 against 
Akana. Ordinarily, if amendment of a final judgment materially alters rights or obligations determined by the prior judgment, a notice of appeal from the amended judgment must be filed. See 
Korsak v. Haw. Permanente Med. Grp.
, 94 Hawai#i 297, 304, 12 P.3d 
1238, 1245 (2000). But the Final Judgment affirmed the Commission's imposition of the fines; it just didn't liquidate the amount. Akana's notice of appeal was timely as to the Amended Final Judgment under HRAP Rule 4(a)(2) ("If a notice of appeal is filed after announcement of a decision but before entry of the judgment or order, such notice shall be considered as filed immediately after the time the judgment or order becomes final for the purpose of appeal.").

V. CONCLUSION 
For all of these reasons, the circuit court's Amended 
Final Judgment and the Commission's Findings of Fact, Conclusions 
of Law, and Decision and Order are affirmed.
