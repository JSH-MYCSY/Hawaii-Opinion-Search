APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Ginoza, C.J., and Wadsworth and Nakasone, JJ.) 
Defendants-Appellants Stuart Kunio Saito and Raynette 
Kuilani Saito (the Saitos) appeal from the September 3, 2019 
"Judgment on Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order 
Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment on Second Amended Complaint Filed July 12, 2018" (Judgment) , entered in 
favor of Plaintiff-Appellee Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Trustee for Option One Mortgage Loan Trust 2007-3 Asset-Backed Certificates, Series 2007-3 (Bank), by the Circuit Court of the 
First Circuit (Circuit Court).
1/  The Saitos also challenge the 
September 3, 2019 "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and 
Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment on Second 
1/ The Honorable James S. Kawashima presided.   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Amended Complaint Filed July 12, 2018" (FOFs/COLs/Order), entered 
by the Circuit Court.  For the reasons explained below, we affirm 
the Judgment. 
Bank filed a Second Amended Complaint against the 
Saitos on July 12, 2018.  Bank alleged, among other things, that: (1) on or about December 19, 2006, the Saitos executed an adjustable rate note (Note), which was eventually endorsed to 
Bank; (2) the Note was secured by a Mortgage dated December 19, 
2006 (Mortgage), executed by the Saitos as mortgagors and 
recorded in the Bureau of Conveyances of the State of Hawai# i 
(Bureau) on January 11, 2007, with respect to certain real 
property in Kâne# ohe, Hawai# i (Property); (3) the Mortgage was 
eventually assigned to Bank via a June 10, 2008 assignment, which 
was recorded in the Bureau on June 24, 2008; (4) the loan went into default and the Saitos entered into a loan modification agreement with the servicer of the loan; (5) Bank completed a nonjudicial foreclosure on the Property, as set forth in a January 27, 2010 Mortgagee's Affidavit of Foreclosure Sale Under Power of Sale (Affidavit of Sale); (6) the Property was sold to 
Bank or its nominee, which was the high bidder at the foreclosure 
auction; and (7) Bank recorded the Affidavit of Sale and the Mortgagee's Quitclaim Deed (Quitclaim Deed) transferring title to 
the Property to Bank.  The Second Amended Complaint sought 
declaratory relief to set aside the nonjudicial foreclosure – specifically, a declaration that, among other things, "[t]he non-judicial public auction held on January 19, 2010, be set aside;" "[t]he Affidavit of Sale is rescinded and null and void;" "[t]he Quitclaim Deed is rescinded;" and "[t]he Mortgage, as modified, is reinstated as a valid and effective lien[.]" 
The Saitos answered the Second Amended Complaint and 
asserted numerous affirmative defenses, including "the doctrine of wrongful foreclosure[,] as the alleged non-judicial foreclosure was lacking in mandatory material contractual and statutory conditions precedent . . . ."
2/  The Saitos did not 
assert a counterclaim against Bank. 
2/ The Saitos had made similar allegations prior to the filing of the
Second Amended Complaint. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
On March 28, 2019, Bank filed a motion for summary 
judgment on the Second Amended Complaint.  The Saitos' opposition 
was filed on May 6, 2019.  The Saitos' sole argument was that "[Bank] has not . . . met its prima facie burden of demonstrating that it was the holder of th[e] [N]ote and [M]ortgage at the time the original complaint was filed herein, as necessary to establish its standing to sue."  In support of this argument, the Saitos relied on Bank of America, N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 139 
Hawai i # 361, 390 P.3d 1248 (2017).  In its reply memorandum, Bank 
argued that unlike the foreclosing mortgagee in Reyes-Toledo, Bank "does not  seek to enforce the Note and Mortgage."  Rather, 
Bank "simply seeks to rescind the non-judicial foreclosure sale." 
Bank's motion was heard on June 26, 2019.  During the 
hearing, Bank's counsel stated that he had the original Note with him, but reiterated: 
[W]e're just trying to set aside the nonjudicial foreclosure
that happened and put the parties back into the positionthat they were prior to the nonjudicial. 
And, . . . if at some point . . . my client does
decide that the loan is in default and that it wants to seek redress, at that point[,] it would, you know, file theappropriate pleadings to indicate that it is better toenforce the note.  But, you know, that's not something we'retrying to do at this point. 
Following arguments, the Circuit Court indicated its intent to 
grant Bank's summary judgment motion. 
On September 3, 2019, the Circuit Court entered the 
FOFs/COLs/Order granting Bank's motion for summary judgment.  The Circuit Court concluded, among other things, that "[t]he standards set forth in . . . Reyes-Toledo . . . apply to noteholders' entitlements to enforce notes, but are otherwise inapposite absent foreclosure in the instant action . . . ."  The Circuit Court granted the following declaratory relief: 
a. The non-judicial foreclosure sale of the
Property held on January 19, 2010 is set aside; 
b. That certain . . .  Affidavit of  . . . Sale 
recorded in the Bureau . . . on January 27, 2010 as Document
No. 2010-012015 is rescinded; 
c. That certain . . . Quitclaim Deed & Conveyance 
Tax Certificate  recorded in the Bureau on February 5, 2010
as Document No. 2010-017093 is cancelled; and

d. That certain Mortgage  recorded in the Bureau on 
January 11, 2007 as Document No. 2007-005528 is reinstated
with its original recording date. 
Also, on September 3, 2019, the Circuit Court entered the 
Judgment in favor of Bank.  This appeal followed. 
The Saitos' sole contention on appeal is that "[t]he 
Circuit Court committed reversible error in granting summary judgment, because [Bank] failed to meet its prima facie burden of establishing its standing through admissible evidence."  The Saitos again cite Reyes-Toledo for the proposition that a plaintiff seeking summary judgment in a foreclosure action has the burden to establish standing to enforce the promissory note at the time the complaint was filed.  
We recently addressed a similar argument in U.S. Bank, 
Nat'l Ass'n, as Trustee for Mastr Asset Backed Securities Trust, 2006-FRE2 v. Omizo, No. CAAP-19-0000524, 2021 WL 5504993 (Haw. App. Nov. 24, 2021) (SDO), and concluded the argument lacked merit.  Id. at *2.  There, as here, the claim at issue did not seek foreclosure, but instead sought declaratory relief to unwind a nonjudicial foreclosure.  Id. There, as here, the Circuit Court granted declaratory relief, not a decree of foreclosure. Id.  As we stated in Omizo, a party has standing to seek declaratory relief: 
(1) where antagonistic claims exist between the parties (a)
that indicate imminent and inevitable litigation, or (b)where the party seeking declaratory relief has a concreteinterest in a legal relation, status, right, or privilegethat is challenged or denied by the other party, who has orasserts a concrete interest in the same legal relation,status, right, or privilege; and (2) a declaratory judgmentwill serve to terminate the uncertainty or controversygiving rise to the proceeding. 
Id. (quoting Tax Found. of Hawai# i v. State, 144 Hawai# i 175, 202, 
439 P.3d 127, 154 (2019)). 
As in Omizo, the record here reflects that Bank had 
standing to request declaratory relief against the Saitos 
regarding the legal consequences of Bank's nonjudicial foreclosure.  The Saitos do not challenge the entry of summary judgment on any other ground.  Accordingly, the Circuit Court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of Bank.
