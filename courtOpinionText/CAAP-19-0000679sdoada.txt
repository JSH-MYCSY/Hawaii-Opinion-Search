PAUL H. STERN, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
NORTH AND SOUTH KONA DIVISION 
(CASE NO. 3DTC-19-053119) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Paul H. Stern (Stern) appeals from 
the Judgment and Notice of Entry of Judgment (Judgment), entered 
by the District Court of the Third Circuit (District Court)1 on 
September 5, 2019. After a bench trial, the District Court 
convicted Stern of Driving Without a License (DWOL), in violation 
of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 286-102(b) (Supp. 2018).2   
1 The Honorable Margaret K. Masunaga presided. 
2 HRS ยง 286-102 provides, in relevant part: 
(b) A person operating the following category or
combination of categories of motor vehicles shall beexamined as provided in section 286-108 and duly licensedby the examiner of drivers:

On appeal, Stern argues (1) the District Court failed 
to obtain a valid waiver of his constitutional right to testify 
as required by Tachibana v. State, 79 Hawai#i 226, 900 P.2d 1293 
(1995), and (2) there was insufficient evidence to convict him. Upon careful review of the record and the briefs submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we vacate Stern's conviction and remand for a new trial. 
(1) Stern argues that the District Court did not 
obtain a valid waiver of his right to testify as required by Tachibana because, inter alia, it did not conduct an ultimate colloquy after the state presented its case and before Stern waived his right to testify. We agree. 
"The validity of a defendant's waiver of constitutional 
rights in a criminal case is a question of law under the state and federal constitutions, which we review under the right/wrong standard." State v. Martin, 146 
Hawai#i 365, 377, 463 P.3d 1022, 
1034 (2020), as corrected (Apr. 23, 2020) reconsideration denied, No. SCWC-14-0001090, 2020 WL 2538923 (May 19, 2020) (citation omitted). Moreover, 
A defendant's right to testify is violated when the colloquy
does not establish an objective basis for finding that thedefendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily gave uptheir right to testify. Courts look to the totality of thefacts and circumstances to determine whether a waiver of the right to testify was voluntarily and intelligently made.

scooters;
(3) Passenger cars of any gross vehicle weight
rating, buses designed to transport fifteen
or fewer occupants, trucks and vans having agross vehicle weight rating of eighteenthousand pounds or less, and autocycles asdescribed in paragraph (2) of the definitionof "motorcycle" in section 286-2; and
(4) All of the motor vehicles in category (3) and
any vehicle that is not a commercial motorvehicle. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Here, after the State presented its witnesses, the 
District Court accepted Stern's waiver of his right to testify 
without a proper colloquy with Stern as to all of the principles regarding his right to testify and right not to testify as required by Tachibana. See Martin, 146 
Hawai#i at 378, 463 P.3d 
at 1035; Tachibana, 79 Hawai# i at 236 n.7, 900 P.2d at 1303 n.7. 
Specifically, after the State presented its case, the following exchange occurred: 
THE COURT: . . . So, Mr. Stern, as I mentioned at
the beginning of the trial that, . . . I had to do the
. . . advisement of rights which we call the . . ."Tachibana colloquy." 
THE DEFENDANT: Mmm-hmm. 
THE COURT: And so I'm going to have to ask you the
same questions. 
So earlier I had said it's your personal right to
testify or not testify, remain silent, and if you have
not testified at the end of the trial after the State rests and all evidence other than . . . your testimony isreceived I have to question you . . . again . . .relating to whether you want to . . . testify or nottestify. 
So, Mr. Stern, have you decided whether you want to
testify or not testify? 
THE DEFENDANT: No. 
THE COURT: Or do you wanna take a recess and talk
to your attorney Mr. Sylva regarding . . . your decision
or before you make a decision? 
(The defendant and his counsel held a discussion
off the record.) 
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And, Your Honor, I believe,
. . . Mr. Stern is ready to proceed with, uh, answeringthe Court's question. Stand up for the judge. 
THE DEFENDANT: Okay, . . . 
THE COURT: Okay. 
THE DEFENDANT: I am not gonna testify. 
THE COURT: Pardon? THE DEFENDANT: I will not testify. THE COURT: You will not be testifying? THE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma'am. Or, yes, Your Honor. 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
THE COURT: Okay. So the Court finds defendant 
knowingly, voluntarily, intelligently waived his right to
testify and will not testify and will remain silent, andthe Court will not hold his silence against him. 
The State contends the District Court's pretrial 
colloquy satisfied Tachibana. However, in the pretrial colloquy, 
the District Court stated at the end that "later on I'm gonna ask you these same questions[,]" but the ultimate colloquy did not ask the same, pertinent questions or involve a true colloquy. Given the circumstances of this case, we cannot say that the pretrial colloquy established that Stern thereafter knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his right to testify. See State v. Eduwensuyi, 141 
Hawai#i 328, 335, 409 P.3d 732, 739 
(2018) (holding that the pretrial advisement in that case did not serve as a substitute for deficiencies in the ultimate colloquy); State v. Preza Haynes, No. CAAP-18-0000719, 2019 WL 4751539, at *2-4, 145 Hawai# i 145, 449 P.3d 746 (App. Sept. 30, 2019) (SDO). 
Also, although the State argues that Stern conferred with his counsel, "a court may not rely upon an off-the-record discussion between counsel and a defendant to establish a valid waiver of a constitutional right[.]" Eduwensuyi, 141 Hawai# i at 336, 409 
P.3d at 740. 
Accordingly, we conclude the District Court did not 
obtain a valid waiver from Stern of his right to testify.
3  We 
further conclude that the District Court's error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See Tachibana, 79 Hawai# i at 240, 900 
P.2d at 1307 ("Once a violation of the constitutional right to testify is established, the conviction must be vacated unless the State can prove that the violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt"); State v. Hoang, 94 Hawai# i 271, 279, 12 P.3d 
371, 379 (App. 2000) ("In general, it is inherently difficult, if not impossible, to divine what effect a violation of the 
3 In light of our conclusion, we need not address Stern's other claims
that the District Court violated Tachibana. 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
defendant's constitutional right to testify had on the outcome of 
any particular case"). We therefore vacate Stern's DWOL conviction. 
(2) Stern argues there was insufficient evidence to 
support his conviction because the State did not prove that the vehicle he was operating on the date of the incident was a moped, as defined in HRS ยง 286-2 (2007).
4 At trial, the citing officer 
testified several times that Stern was operating a "moped." Stern did not object to, or move to preclude, the officer's testimony as to the type of vehicle that Stern operated. The District Court was thus entitled to consider the officer's testimony that the vehicle Stern operated was a moped. See State v. Samuel, 74 Haw. 141, 147, 838 P.2d 1374, 1378 (1992) ("The general rule is that evidence to which no objection has been made may properly be considered by the trier of fact and its admission will not constitute grounds for reversal.") (citation omitted). On this record, and viewing the evidence in the strongest light for the prosecution, see State v. Kalaola, 124 Hawai# i 43, 49, 
237 P.3d 1109, 1115 (2010), there was substantial evidence that Stern was operating a moped. We therefore reject Stern's contention that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction. 
4 HRS ยง 286-2 provides: 
"Moped" means a device upon which a person may ride which
has two or three wheels in contact with the ground, amotor having a maximum power output capability measuredat the motor output shaft, in accordance with the Societyof Automotive Engineers standards, of two horsepower (onethousand four hundred ninety-two watts) or less and, ifit is a combustion engine, a maximum piston or rotordisplacement of 3.05 cubic inches (fifty cubiccentimeters) and which will propel the moped, unassisted,on a level surface at a maximum speed no greater thanthirty miles per hour; and a direct or automatic powerdrive system which requires no clutch or gear shiftoperation by the moped driver after the drive system isengaged with the power unit.
