NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
NO. CAAP-19-0000683
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAII, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
LUKE J. WARNER, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(1PC041001944)
ORDER
DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
AND DISMISSING ALL PENDING MOTIONS AS MOOT
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.)
Upon review of this appeal filed by Defendant-Appellant
Luke J. Warner (Warner), self-represented, from the Honorable
Karl K. Sakamoto's May 24, 2007 judgment of conviction in circuit
court criminal case number 1PC041001944, it appears that we lack
appellate jurisdiction because Warner's notice of appeal in CAAP-
19-0000683, which he apparently tendered to prison officials for
mailing no earlier than September 16, 2019, is untimely under
Rule 4(b)(1) of the Hawai#i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP)
by more than twelve years.  
As a result of Warner's plea of no contest to
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawaii's (the State) September 30,
2004 complaint in Criminal Case No. 1PC041001944 charging Warner
with burglary in the second degree in violation of Hawaii Revised
Statutes (HRS) ยง 708-811 (1993), the circuit court entered a
May 24, 2007 judgment of conviction and sentence against Warner,NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
which was immediately appealable pursuant to HRS ยง 641-11 (2016). 
HRAP Rule 4(b)(1) requires that, "[i]n a criminal case, the
notice of appeal shall be filed within 30 days after entry of the
judgment or order appealed from."  The issue whether an appellant
"compli[ed] with the requirement of the timely filing of a notice
of appeal, as set forth in HRAP Rule 4(b)(1), is jurisdictional." 
State v. Bohannon, 102 Hawai# i 228, 234, 74 P.3d 980, 986 (2003)
(citations, internal quotation marks, and original brackets
omitted).  Because Warner is currently a self-represented
prisoner, we utilize Warner's date of signature in his notice of
appeal, September 16, 2019, as the earliest possible date on
which Warner might have tendered his notice of appeal to prison
officials for mailing.  Cf. Setala v. J.C. Penney Company, 97
Hawai#i 484, 485, 40 P.3d 886, 887 (2002) (deeming the effective
date of a pro se prisoner's notice of appeal to be the day on
which he tendered it to prison officials).  Even assuming that
the effective date of Warner's notice of appeal is September 16,
2019, Warner's notice of appeal is untimely under HRAP
Rule 4(b)(1) by more than twelve years.  
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED as follows:
1.Appellate court case number CAAP-19-0000683 is
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
2.All motions in appellate court case number CAAP-
19-0000683 are dismissed as moot.
3.This order is without prejudice to Warner filing a
petition pursuant to Rule 40 of the Hawai#i Rules of Penal
Procedure in the circuit court.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai#i, March 16, 2020.
