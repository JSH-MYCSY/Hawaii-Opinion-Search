NO. CAAP-19-0000691
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
NATHAN McCOTTER, Appellant-Appellant, v.
DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, SECURITIES
ENFORCEMENT BRANCH, Appellee-Appellee, 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 1CC181001631)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL
(By:  Chan, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.)
Upon review of the record, it appears that:
(1) On October 9, 2019, self-represented Appellant-
Appellant Nathan McCotter (McCotter) conventionally filed the
notice of appeal.  The circuit court clerk electronically filed
the notice of appeal on October 10, 2019;
(2) On October 22, 2019, McCotter filed the statement
of jurisdiction;
(3) On November 18, 2019, the circuit court clerk filed
the record on appeal, and the appellate clerk notified the
parties that the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief were
due on or before November 29, 2019, and December 30, 2019,
respectively;
(4) McCotter did not file the opening brief or request
an extension of time;
(5) On January 29, 2020, the appellate clerk notified
McCotter that the time for filing the statement of jurisdictionNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
and opening brief had expired, the matter would be called to the
court's attention on February 10, 2020, for appropriate action,
which could include dismissal of the appeal, under Hawai#i Rules
of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rules 12.1(e) and 30, and McCotter
could request relief from default by motion; and
(6) The November 18, 2019 notice of entering case on
calendar and the January 29, 2020 default notice mistakenly
referenced a deadline for the statement of jurisdiction, which
McCotter had previously filed.  The appellate clerk mailed the
notice of entering case on calendar to McCotter at his address on
record, and no return mail was received.  The appellate clerk
mailed the default notice to McCotter at the same address, and
the United States Postal Service returned it, marked "Return to
Sender, Attempted - Not Known, Unable to Forward."  McCotter has
not filed a notice of change of address, consistent with HRAP
Rule 25(f), and he took no further action in this appeal.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is
dismissed for failure to file the opening brief, under HRAP
Rule 30.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai#i, March 6, 2020.
