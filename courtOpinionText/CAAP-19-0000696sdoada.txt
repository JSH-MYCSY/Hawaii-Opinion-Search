APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE  FIFTH  CIRCUIT

SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Wadsworth and  Nakasone, JJ.)  
  This is the latest appeal1  stemming  from the  
mortgagee's non-judicial foreclosure sale of its mortgagor's 
residential property  to itself  in the underlying case.   Resmae 
Liquidation Properties LLC ( Resmae)  conducted the 2008 
foreclosure auction on O ʻahu, at which it bought the Kaua ʻi

residential property ( Property) belonging to its mortgagor  
Defendant-Appellant Leigh Matsuyoshi ( Matsuyoshi). Resmae 
subsequently  conveyed the Property by  quitclaim deed to 
Plaintiff-Appellee Kondaur Capital Corporation ( Kondaur), which  
filed a 2012 Complaint seeking possession of the Property and 
Matsuyoshi's ejectment. This latest  appeal arises out of a 
bench trial conducted on remand, following  the Hawaiʻi Supreme 
Court's  2015  decision in Kondaur II,  vacating summary judgment 
on  Kondaur's ejectment complaint.   Kondaur prevailed at trial.  
Matsuyoshi appeals from the Circuit Court of the Fifth 
Circuit's ( Circuit Court )2 (1) March 15, 2019 "Findings of Fact 
and Conclusions of Law After Trial" ( FOFs/COLs); (2) March 15, 
2019 Final Judgment (Judgment ); June 13, 2018 "Order Denying 
Defendant Leigh Matsuyoshi's Request for Judicial Notice Filed 
February 21, 2018" ; and (4) September 11, 2019 "Order Granting 
Plaintiff's Motion to Tax Costs and Expenses and for Award of 
Attorneys' Fees Filed March 29, 2019" ( Order Granting Fees ). 
On appeal, Matsuyoshi contends3 that the Circuit Court 
erred (1) in Findings of Fact (FOFs) 63, 64, 69 , and Conclusion 
of Law ( COL) 7, "that the sale on Oahu was not a factor to be 
considered in evaluating Resmae's conduct and that conducting 
the sale on Oahu was fair, reasonably diligent and in good 
faith"; (2) by finding that the sale price was "reasonable"; (3) 
by concluding in COL s 4 to 15 that the sale complied with the

2  3   We have edited, reordered,  renumbered,  and consolidated 
Matsuyoshi's  numerous  points of error (POEs )  for clarity. In addition to the 
POEs  above, Matsuyoshi also challenges certain oral findings made by the 
Circuit Court prior to the issuance of the FOF s/COLs. Because a court's 
"written order generally controls over its oral statements[,]" we do not 
address these additional contentions. State v. Milne, 149 Hawaiʻ i 329, 335,

"statutory, [sic]  power of sale and common law duties"; (4)  by 
admitting certain evidence, refusing to rule on preliminary 
admissibility of evidence,  and denying a motion in limine to 
exclude certain testimony; (5)  in ruling that the notice of 
default and acceleration was delivered to or received by Matsuyoshi at least 30 days before the deadline to cure default; (6)  by refusing to take judicial notice that the Honolulu Star-
Bulletin stopped circulation on Kaua ‘i in 2004 and finding that 
the newspaper had general circulation in Kaua ‘i County; (7)  in 
awarding Kondaur its attorneys' fees and costs; and (8)  by 
dismissing Matsuyoshi's quiet title counterclaim in COL 16 and entering judgment against Matsuyoshi on that claim.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve 
Matsuyoshi's contentions as follows , and vacate and remand. 
  In Kondaur II, the supreme court held that  "in 
situations where a mortgagee  acts as both the seller and the 
purchaser of the subject property at a non-judicial foreclosure sale,"  as  in this case, the mortgagee or its quitclaim 
transferee  "bears the burden of proving compliance"  with Ulrich 
v. Sec.  Inv.  Co. Ltd., 35 Haw. 158 (Haw. Terr. 1939).   136 
Hawaiʻi at 229, 361 P.3d at 456.  "Ulrich  requires mortgagees to 
exercise their right to non-judicial foreclosure under a power of sale in a manner that is fair, reasonably diligent, and in 
good faith, and to demonstrate that an adequate price was 
procured for the property." Id.  at 240, 361 P.3d at 467 
(citation omitted).   
4 Matsuyoshi does not challenge the Judgment as to her slander of 
title claim.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The supreme court concluded that Kondaur failed to 
satisfy its initial burden on summary judgment, because 
Kondaur's only evidence as to the manner in which the 
foreclosure sale was conducted, was the Affidavit of Sale by 
Resmae's attorney . Id. at 242-43, 361 P.3d at 469 -70. This 
Affidavit of Sale m erely certifie d compliance with statutory 
requirements and mortgage terms , and failed to establish 
compliance with Ulrich, including why the sale was conducted on 
a different island from the Property's locati on: 
[T]he Affidavit of Sale fails to provide any averments 
as to the fairness and regularity of the foreclosure 
sale or as to whether [Resmae] conducted the foreclosure 
sale in a diligent and reasonable manner. This document does not even speak of any reason as to why the 
foreclosure sale was conducted on O ‘ahu when the Property 
is on 
Kaua‘i.   Although the Affidavit of Sale states that 
the Property was sold for $416,900.20 at the foreclosure 
sale, it does not make any declaration concerning the 
adequacy of this price.  
 . . .  Hence, a mortgagee's minimal adherence to 
the statutory requirements and the terms of the mortgage 
under which the foreclosure sale is conducted —the only 
facts that [Resmae]'s Affidavit of Sale supports —does 
not establish that the foreclosure sale similarly 
satisfied the Ulrich  requirements.  
Id.  (emphases added) (cleaned up). The supreme court rejected 
Kondaur's justification for holding a  sale on Oʻahu  for the Kaua ʻi 
Property as "conclusory" and without evidentiary support, as 
follows:  
4  Kondaur asserted in the circuit court and the ICA 
that "conducting the public sale on the island of Oahu 
made it possible for the foreclosing mortgagee to 
conduct the sale in a larger market with more 
prospective purchasers." This assertion fails to 
establish that the foreclosure sale satisfied the 
requirements of Ulrich, not only because it is 
conclusory  but also because evidence substantiating this 
assertion was not submitted in support of the MSJ .  
 
 In any event, because the Property is located on 
Kaua‘i and the terms of the sale included a clause 
requiring the buyer to take the Property "AS IS" and 
"WHERE IS,"  it is at least a question of fact whether  
       
 
 
 
  
 
  
  
  
 
  
 
   
  
   
  
 
  
  
  
    
  
 
 
     
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the foreclosure sale actually benefited from the larger 
pool of potential real estate buyers on Oah ‘u. [sic]   The 
record simply is insufficient to prove or disprove the 
advantages or disadvantages of selling an "as is" 
residential property on a different island .  
Id. at 242 n.32, 361 P.3d at 469 n.32 (emphases added) ( cleaned 
up). The supreme court vacated the judgment in favor of 
Kondaur, and remanded to the Circuit Court for further 
proceedings. Id. at 244, 361 P.3d at 471. 
On remand, the Circuit Court held a May 29-30, 2018 
bench trial on Kondaur's ejectment c omplaint and Matsuyoshi's 
counterclaim, during which the Circuit Court heard testimonies 
of Matsuyoshi and Kondaur's asset manager, Evan Williams 
(Williams ), and received evidence . 
On July 12, 2018, the Circuit Court orally ruled in 
favor of Kondaur and denied the counterclaim. 
On March 15, 2019, the Circuit Court entered the 
FOFs/COLs that concluded , inter alia , that the foreclosure sale 
of the Property to Resmae was not void or voidable ; the 
quitclaim deed conveyed "good title" to Kondaur ; Matsuyoshi ha d 
no right to use or possess the Property ; and Matsuyoshi failed 
to present a prima facie case on her counterclaim for quiet 
title or slander of title. The same day, the Circuit Court 
entered the Judgment and issued a Writ of Ejectment. 
On March 29, 2019, Kondaur filed a Motion to Tax Costs 
and Expenses and for Award of Attorneys' Fees , which the Circuit 
Court granted on September 11, 2019. 
1. The trial record does not contain evidence beyond 
what was deemed insufficient in Kondaur II , to 
support the Circuit Court 's conclusion that the O ‘ahu 
sale of the "as is" Kaua‘i Property was reasonable, 
diligent, and in good faith . 
Matsuyoshi contends that the Circuit Court err oneously 
found in FOFs 63, 64, 69 , and COL 7, that the sale on O‘ahu

complied with Ulrich, where the trial record here contained "no 
evidence beyond the . . . Foreclosure Affidavit " deemed 
insufficient in Kondaur II. These FOFs and COL 7 , which contain 
the Circuit Court 's location -of-sale findings and Ulrich-
compliance determinatio n, state: 
63. The location of the sale at the First 
Circuit Court on Oahu was not a factor to be considered 
in evaluating whether [Resmae] acted with reasonable 
diligence in conducting the sale. 
64. The location of the sale did not prejudice 
Defendant Matsuyoshi; rather it exposed the Property to 
a wider audience with more resources than available on 
the Island of Kauai. 
   . ... 
69. The foreclosure sale was conducted in a 
manner that was fair, reasonably diligent and in good 
faith. 
   . ... 
[(Conclusions of Law)] 
7. [Resmae] exercised its right to nonjudicial 
foreclosure under its power of sale in a manner that was 
fair, reasonably diligent and in good faith . . . . 
We review FOFs under the clearly erroneous standard.  . . . .

record lacks substantial evidence to support the finding, or, 
evidence exists to support the finding, but we are left with the 
definite and firm conviction in reviewing the entire evidence 
that a mistak e has been committed. " Id. (citation omitted).

(cleaned up). " Where a conclusion of law presents a mixed 
question of law and fact, we review this conclusion under the 
clearly erroneous standard. A mixed question of law and fact is 
a conclusion dependent upon the facts and circumstances of the 
particular case. " Uyeda, 144 Hawai ʻi at 170, 439 P.3d at 122 
(citation omitted). 
  FOF 63:   Matsuyoshi argues that FOF 63, that sale 
location was  not a factor in evaluating the "reasonable 
diligence"  requirement, is "directly contrary"  to Kondaur II. 
We conclude that FOF 63, which appears to be a COL, is wrong. 
Kondaur II  required Kondaur to specifically establish how or why 
the different-island location of the sale of "as is" residential 
property reflected reasonable diligence. See  136 Hawai ʻi  at 242, 
242 n.32, 361 P.3d at 469, 469 n.32  (concluding that the 
Affidavit of Sale, which "d[id] not even speak of any reason as to why the foreclosure sale was conducted on O ‘ahu when the 
Property is on Kaua ʻi[,]"  was insufficient, and that the record 
there was "insufficient to prove or disprove the advantages or 
disadvantages of selling an 'as is'  residential property on a 
different island").  
FOFs 64 and 6 9: FOF 64 was a factual finding that the 
sale location "did not prejudice " Matsuyoshi because "it exposed 
the Property to a wider audience with more resources " than what 
was available on Kaua ‘i, which we review for clear error . See 
Uyeda, 144 Hawai ʻi at 170, 439 P.3d at 122. FOF 69 contained the 
Circuit Court 's ultimate Ulrich conclusion that the sale "was 
conducted in a manner that was fair, reasonably diligent and in 
good faith. " This conclusion involved a mixed question of law 
and fact that we also revie w under the clear error standard. 
See id.

   Matsuyoshi argues  that there was no evidence presented 
at trial, beyond the same Affidavit of Sale  deemed insufficient 
in Kondaur II,  addressing  any reasons for conducting the 
foreclosure sale on O ʻahu, to support FOFs 64 and 69. Kondaur 
disagrees, raising  multiple arguments we address below.

First, Kondaur argues that FOFs 64 and 6 9 are 
supported by unchallenge d FOFs 53-54, 56-57, 59-62, 66-68.5 This 
5   Unchallenged FOFs are binding. Okada Trucking Co., Ltd.  
v. Bd. of Water Supply, 97 Hawaiʻi 450, 459, 40 P.3d 73, 82 (2002).   
These FOFs state: 
53. On October 9, 2008, [Resmae] served on 
Defendant Matsuyoshi and posted on the Property a notice 
of nonjudicial foreclosure sale under Hawaii law 
("Notice"). (Exhibit D -17, at pages 48 and 53) 
54. The Notice identified the date, time and 
location of the proposed nonjudicial foreclosure sale as 
November 13, 2008 at noon in front of the First Circuit 
Court building, 777 Punchbowl Street, Honolulu, Hawaii. 
   . . .. 
56. The advertisement described the property by 
its street address in Lihue, Kauai and by its Tax Map 
Key number, allowing any reader to identify, locate and 
research the specific parcel of real property advertised 
for sale. 
57. The advertisement gave the name and address 
of the contact person for the sale who was located in 
Hawaii. 
   . . .. 
59. There was no evidence that [R esmae] did 
anything to suppress information about the sale or 
hinder potential bidders' ability to inspect the 
Property. 
60. After receiving the notice of sale and after 
the posting, Defendant Matsuyoshi did not object to 
[Resmae] 's representative about the date, time or 
location of the foreclosure sale prior to the published 
date of the sale.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
argument is unpersuasive. FOFs 53-54, 56-57, and 61-62 are from  
the same Affidavit of Sale previously deemed insufficient to 
address the different-island location of the sale. FOFs 59, 60, and 66-68  do not  address whether the "foreclosure sale actually 
benefited"  from being held on O ʻahu, or whether there were any 
"advantages or disadvantages  of selling an 'as is'  residential 
property on a different island."   Kondaur II, 136 
Hawaiʻi at 242 
n.32, 361 P.3d at 469 n.32.  Kondaur 's reliance on these 
unchallenged FOFs is misplaced.  
Kondaur also argues that FOFs 64 and 6 9 were "further 
supported by substantial evidence of record, including 
Matsuyoshi's trial testimony, recorded deeds, county tax 
documents, and the trial testimony of [Williams]" --without 
pointing to where in the record such evidence exists. We 
disregard these arguments. See HRAP Rule 28(b)(7) ( requiring 
argument to contain citations to "parts of the record relied 
on"). 
61. The nonjudicial foreclosure sale was held at 
the date, time and place in the Notice. 
62. At the nonjudicial foreclosure sale, 
[Resmae] made the winning bid of $
   . . . . 416,900.20. 
66. In 2008, the real estate markets in the 
State of Hawaii and on the County of Kauai were falling 
as a result of the recession that had started on the 
Mainland [.] 
67. [Resmae] 's bid for the Property was higher 
than the consideration paid to the Matsuyoshi family 
members in 2007 for their interests in the Property. 
68. [Resmae] 's bid for the Property was higher 
than [Resmae] was able to obtain two years later from 
Kondaur. 
9  
       
 
 
 
  Here, the record of the trial reflects that neither 
Williams's nor Matsuyoshi's trial testimonies discussed the 
foreclosure sale on O ʻahu. Other than the Affidavit of Sale,  
none of the other exhibits in ev
idence  contained  information 
regarding the rationale for a different-island location for this 
foreclosure sale.   Thus,  Kondaur failed to meet its burden to 
show that conducting the non-judicial  foreclosure sale on Oʻ ahu 
for the "as is" Kaua ʻi Property was "fair, reasonably diligent, 
and in good faith[.]"   Kondaur II, 136 Hawai ʻi at 240, 361 P.3d 
at 467  (citation omitted).  COL 7, which concluded that the 
Ulrich  requirements were met, was clear error.   See  Uyeda, 144

2. The Circuit Court erred in entering judgment in 
favor of Kondaur and against Matsuyoshi on Kondaur's 
ejectment complaint. 
  To prove an ejectment claim, a plaintiff must 
(1)  prove that they own the parcel at  issue  (meaning  they must 
have title to and the right of possession of such parcel); and (2) establish that possession is unlawfully held by another. 
Kondaur II, 136 Hawai ʻi  at 241, 361 P.3d at 468.  
Matsuyoshi argues that Kondaur failed to meet its 
burden under Kondaur II , and as a matter of law, that Kondaur's 
"title is therefore invalid ." Matsuyoshi claims that because 
6 Kondaur presented closing argument , but not evidence, regarding 
the location of the sale on O ‘ahu, that: Honolulu county "is the location of 
the capital markets in Hawaii "; Honolulu 's population was "many times that of 
the County of Kauai "; "finding bidders in November 2008 willing to buy the 
Property was higher in Honolulu than anywhere else in the State "; that 
"[e]xposing the Property to sale to potential bidders throughout the State 
through a sale in Honolulu provided the best opportunity "; "[t]he location of 
the sale did not materially affect the prospects for the foreclosure "; and 
"[n]o evidence was presented that Kauai residents desired to bid on the 
Property but the location of the sale prevented them. " Closing argument is 
not evidence. See State v. McGhee , 140 Hawai ‘i 113, 119, 398 P.3d 702, 708 
(2017).

Kondaur is "unable to enforce its 'title ,' . . . Matsuyoshi is 
automatically entitled to set it aside [.]" 
Here, Kondaur relied on the quitclaim deed to prove 
its ownership and title to the Property . The quitclaim deed 
conveying title from Resmae to Kondaur , however, "specifically 
carve[d] out from Kondaur's interest any claims that Matsuyoshi 
may still have on the Property [,]" by stating that Resmae made 
"no representations, warranties or promises regarding any claims 
by LEIGH MATSUYOSHI ." Id. (cleaned up). 
Because the title to the Property deeded by [Resmae]  to 
Kondaur derives from a non -judicial foreclosure sale of the 
Property, the strength and validity of Kondaur's title is 
unavoidably intertwined with the validity of the foreclosure sale. It therefore became incumbent upon 
Kondaur to demonstrate that the foreclosure sale was 
conducted in accordance with Ulrich  to prove that its 
quitclaim deed is valid and superior to any claims that Matsuyoshi may have on the Property.  
Id. at 241, 361 P.3d at 46 8 (emphasis added) (internal citation 
omitted) . 
  In light of our conclusion supra  that  the Ulrich  
requirements were not met,  Kondaur failed to demonstrate that 
its quitclaim deed, from which Kondaur derived its title, was 
"valid  and superior to any claims that Matsuyoshi may have on 
the Property."   Id.   Thus, Kondaur did not prove  its ownership 
of the Property  with valid title.  COLs 11-14, relating to the 
ejectment complaint,  were  clear error.7   See  Uyeda, 144 Hawai ‘i 
7 COLs 11-14 state: 
11. [Resmae]'s quitclaim deed to Kondaur conveyed all 
of [Resmae]'s interest in the Property and conveyed good 
title to the Property to Kondaur. 
12. Defendant Matsuyoshi has no right to use or 
possession of the Property. 
13. Defendant Matsuyoshi, her assigns, heirs, agents, 
servants, employees, guests, invitees, and others acting 
11  
       
 
 
 
   
  Matsuyoshi also asserts that "in Kondaur's hands, the 
sale is void, not merely voidable."  In Kondaur II, however, the 
supreme court stated: "if the Ulrich  requirements were not 
satisfied, a quitclaim deed would convey only a voidable  
interest in the [P]roperty." 136 Hawai ʻi  at 242 n.29, 361 P.3d 
at 469 n.29  (bolding added)
. In Delapinia v. Nationstar Mortg.  
LLC, 150 Hawai‘ i  91, 101, 497 P.3d 106, 116 (2021), the supreme 
court clarified that "a wrongful foreclosure that violates the 
power of sale is voidable ,  not void."   (Bolding added.) The 
Delapinia  court explained that this conclusion is consistent 
with Hawai‘ i precedent that a foreclosure violating  "a statute 
governing the nonjudicial foreclosure scheme" -- such as HRS § 
667-5 at issue in Mount v. Apao,  139 Hawai ʻi 167, 384 P.3d 1268 
(2016)  -- and a foreclosure violating "other law extrinsic to 
the mortgage itself" -- such as  the  Ulrich  requirements applied 
in Kondaur II  -- render the sale  conducted thereto  "voidable  at 
the election of the mortgagor[.]" Id.  at 101-02, 497 P.3d at 
116-17 (bolding added) (citing Kondaur II, 136 Hawaiʻ i at 242

3. The Circuit Court erred in entering judgment in 
favor of Kondaur and against Matsuyoshi on 
Matsuyoshi's quiet title counterclaim. 
Matsuyoshi contends the Circuit Court erred in 
entering judgment against her on her counterclaim for quiet 
title. Matsuyoshi 's counterclaim asserted that: "Matsuyoshi's 
claim to title is superior to that of Kondaur due to defects in 
Kondaur's title, including, but not limited to, . . . defects in 
the non-judicial foreclosure sale conducted by Resmae." 
The minimum elements of a quiet title claim are: the 
plaintiff "has a substantial interest in the property"; and 
plaintiff 's "title is superior to that of the defendants." 
KaʻUpulehu Land LLC v. Heirs & Assigns of Pahukula , 136 Hawai‘i 
123, 137, 358 P.3d 692, 706 (2015) ( cleaned up). 
In light of our holding supra that the invalidity of 
the sale compromised Kondaur's title under the quitclaim deed , 
we conclude COL 15 ( stating "Matsuyoshi failed to present a 
prima facie case for quiet title "), and COL 16 (dismissing the 
quiet title counterclaim with prejudice ), were clearly 
erroneous . See Uyeda, 144 Hawaiʻi at 170, 439 P.3d at 122. 
Here, the trial record contained prima facie evidence of 
Matsuyoshi's interest in the Property based on a 2007 deed9 
reflecting Matsuyoshi's ownership interest in the Property , and 
the 2010 quitclaim deed from Resmae to Kondaur that acknowledg ed 
Matsuyoshi's " ownership claim on the Property ." Kondaur I I, 136 
8 In this regard, COL 10, which state d that "[t]he nonjudicial 
foreclosure sale to [Resmae] is not void or voidabl e[,]" was clearly 
erroneous. 
9 The 2007 deed was a trial exhibit and is reflected in FOF 20.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawaiʻi at 241, 361 P.3d at 468 . We thus vacate the Judgment in 
favor of Kondaur on Matsuyoshi's quiet title counterclaim. 
Finally, i n light of our resolution , we vacate the 
Order Granting Fees since Kondaur is no longer the prevailing 
party.10 We need not address Matsuyoshi's remaining contentions 
of error related to the trial. 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the Circuit 
Court of the Fifth Circuit 's March 15, 2019 "Findings of Fact 
and Conclusions of Law After Trial " and Final Judgment ; the June 
13, 2018 "Order Denying Defendant Leigh Matsuyoshi's Request for 
Judicial Notice Filed February 21, 2018" ; and September 11, 2019 
"Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion to Tax Costs and Expenses and 
for Award of Attorneys' Fees Filed March 29, 2019 ." We remand 
for further proceedings consistent with this summary disposition 
order. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai‘i, June 28, 2024.
