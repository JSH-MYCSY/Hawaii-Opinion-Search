TATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v. 
PAOLA IBARRA, Defendant-Appellant,
and 
GUSTAVO FERREIRA, Co-Defendant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1CPC-17-0001646) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: 
Leonard, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Paola Ibarra
 appeals from the 
"Judgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence" entered by the 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit on September 11, 2019.1 For 
the reasons explained below, we affirm the Judgment. 
Ibarra was charged by complaint with Sex Trafficking in 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 712-1202(l)(a) 
(Count 1) and Kidnapping in violation of HRS § 707-720(1)(e) 
(Count 2). Jury trial began on October 15, 2018. Ibarra 
testified on her own behalf. Pursuant to an agreement between 
Ibarra and the complaining witness (CW), Ibarra bought CW a one-
way ticket to Hawai# i and agreed to pay for a hotel room with the 
understanding that CW "would pay her back once she made the

money." Upon their arrival, Ibarra and CW engaged in 
prostitution. Ibarra set up "dates" for herself and CW by creating, posting, and re-posting advertisements on a website. 
According to Ibarra, CW did not give her money CW made 
from prostitution "[o]ther than what . . . our arrangement was[.]" (Emphasis added.) Ibarra never told CW exactly how much CW owed Ibarra; CW just paid Ibarra as CW earned money from prostitution. 
CW testified that she gave all the money that she made 
from prostitution to Ibarra, then to Ibarra's boyfriend (co-defendant Gustavo Ferreira) when Ferreira arrived in Hawai# i. 
On October 22, 2018, the jury found Ibarra guilty on 
Count 1 of the included offense of Promoting Prostitution,
2 and 
not guilty on Count 2. Ibarra moved for judgment of acquittal or, in the alternative, a new trial. The circuit court denied the motion. The Judgment was entered on September 11, 2019; Ibarra was sentenced to five years of probation. The circuit court entered findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an order denying the motion for judgment of acquittal or new trial on October 21, 2019. This appeal followed. 
Ibarra raises three points of error: 
"A. The circuit court failed to ensure that 
Ibarra's waiver of her right not to testify
was knowing, intelligent and voluntary"; 
"B. The circuit court erred in denying Ibarra's
post-verdict motion for judgment ofacquittal"; and 
"C. The circuit court erred in denying Ibarra's
motion for new trial." 
2 HRS § 712-1203. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
1. The circuit court was not required to
engage Ibarra in a Tachibana colloquyprior to her testimony. 
At a pre-trial hearing, the circuit court informed 
Ibarra of her right not to testify. Ibarra waived her right not 
to testify and took the stand following the State's case-in-chief. On appeal, Ibarra does not take issue with her pre-trial waiver, but rather she argues that the circuit court failed to engage her in an ultimate Tachibana
3 colloquy before she 
testified. 
In State v. Lewis, 94 Hawai# i 292, 12 P.3d 1233 (2000), 
the Hawai
#i Supreme Court held that an ultimate Tachibana 
colloquy is not required in cases where a defendant has indicated they intend to testify. Id. at 296, 12 P.3d at 1237. 
Ibarra 
relies on State v. Torres, 144 Hawai# i 282, 439 P.3d 234 (2019). 
In Torres, the supreme court held that a Tachibana colloquy must be given in all trials, including those where the defendant elects to take the stand. Id. at 294-95, 439 P.3d at 246-47. 
The supreme court expressly stated, however, that the new requirement was to be given prospective application "in trials beginning after the filing date of [Torres]." Id. at 295, 439 
P.3d at 247 (emphasis added). 
Ibarra's trial occurred before Torres was decided. 
Lewis applied when Ibarra was tried; the circuit court was not required to conduct an ultimate Tachibana colloquy before Ibarra testified. 
2. The circuit court did not err in denying
Ibarra's motion for judgment ofacquittal. 
When reviewing the grant or denial of a motion for 
judgment of acquittal, 
we employ the same standard that a trial court applies tosuch a motion, namely, whether, upon the evidence viewed in 
3 Tachibana v. State, 79 Hawai #i 226, 900 P.2d 1293 (1995). 
3  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the light most favorable to the prosecution and in full
recognition of the province of the trier of fact, theevidence is sufficient to support a prima facie case so thata reasonable mind might fairly conclude guilt beyond areasonable doubt. Sufficient evidence to support a primafacie case requires substantial evidence as to everymaterial element of the offense charged. Substantial evidence as to every material element of the offense chargedis credible evidence which is of sufficient quality andprobative value to enable a person of reasonable caution tosupport a conclusion. Under such a review, we give fullplay to the right of the fact finder to determinecredibility, weigh the evidence, and draw justifiableinferences of fact. 
State v. Timoteo, 87 Hawai# i 108, 112-13, 952 P.2d 865, 869-70 
(1997) (quoting State v. Jhun, 83 Hawai# i 472, 481, 927 P.2d 
1355, 1364 (1996)). 
As set forth in HRS § 712-1203(1) (Supp. 2016), the 
offense of Promoting Prostitution may be committed in one of two
ways: "A person commits the offense of promoting prostitution if  
the person knowingly advances or profits from prostitution" (emphasis added). In denying Ibarra's motion, the circuit court found that a reasonable jury could not find that Ibarra "advanced" prostitution, but a reasonable jury could find that Ibarra "profited" from prostitution.  On appeal, Ibarra asserts 
that the circuit court erred in denying her motion for judgment of acquittal because the court misinterpreted "profits from prostitution" as defined in HRS § 712-1201.

The interpretation of a statute is a question of law
which this court reviews de novo. Moreover, where the
language of the statute is plain and unambiguous, our onlyduty is to give effect to its plain and obvious meaning.When construing a statute, our foremost obligation is toascertain and give effect to the intention of thelegislature, which is to be obtained primarily from thelanguage contained in the statute itself. And we must read 
4 The State's answering brief asserts that there was "sufficient
evidence" that Ibarra also "advanced" prostitution. However, the State didnot cross-appeal from the circuit court's order. Accordingly, we cannotaddress the State's argument. See HRS § 641-13(5) (2016) (providing that an
appeal may be taken by the State "[f]rom a ruling on a question of law adverseto the State, where the defendant was convicted and appeals from thejudgment[.]"); Doe v. Doe, 99 Hawai #i 1, 12-13, 52 P.3d 255, 266-67 (2002)
("It is well-settled that 'an appellee is ordinarily not entitled to attack ajudgment without a cross appeal.'") (quoting Arthur v. Sorensen, 80 Hawai #i 
159, 167, 907 P.2d 745, 753 (1995)).

statutory language in the context of the entire statute and
construe it in a manner consistent with its purpose. 
State v. Toyomura, 80 Hawai# i 8, 18-19, 904 P.2d 893, 903-04 
(1995) (cleaned up). 
HRS § 712-1201 (2014 & Supp. 2016) provides, in 
relevant part: 
(2) A person "profits from prostitution" if, acting otherthan as a prostitute receiving compensation forpersonally-rendered prostitution services, the personaccepts or receives money or other property pursuantto an agreement or understanding with any personwhereby the person participates or is to participatein the proceeds of prostitution activity. 
Ibarra argues that in order to constitute a "profit" CW 
must have paid Ibarra a sum greater than the amount that Ibarra 
advanced for CW's airfare and hotel costs. But the plain language of the statute does not implicate a profit in the financial accounting sense; a defendant "profits from prostitution" if they "accept[] or receive[] money" — other than for prostitution services they personally render — "pursuant to an agreement" whereby the defendant "participates . . . in the proceeds of prostitution activity." HRS § 712-1201(2). 
Ibarra challenges the circuit court's finding of fact 
no. 18: 
Therefore, in this case, based on the evidence adduced at
trial, a reasonable juror could have further found that themoney paid to [Ibarra], in some instances, arose out ofprostitution services personally rendered by [CW], but notby [Ibarra]. 
The finding was supported by substantial evidence; Ibarra 
testified that she and CW had an agreement that CW would pay money to Ibarra that CW earned by rendering services as a prostitute. The finding was not clearly erroneous. 
Ibarra also challenges the following conclusions of law 
made by the circuit court: 
5. As to profiting from prostitution, in light of
the statutory definition of "profits from prostitution" 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
quoted above, the evidence adduced at trial, and viewing
that evidence in the light most favorable to the State, thecourt concludes that a reasonable juror could find that[Ibarra] profited from prostitution. Specifically, areasonable juror could find that [Ibarra] and [CW] had anagreement or understanding that [CW] would pay [Ibarra] backfor any airfare and/or half of the hotel room costs and that[Ibarra] knew that the money paid to [Ibarra] by [CW] arosefrom prostitution activities personally rendered by [CW],and not by [Ibarra]. 
6. Therefore, under the statutory definition quoted
above, a reasonable juror could find [Ibarra] guilty ofpromoting prostitution as she "profited from prostitution"and therefore Defendant Paola Ibarra's Motion for Judgmentof Acquittal or in the alternative, Motion for New Trial isdenied. 
These conclusions were not wrong; they were supported by 
substantial evidence and reflected an application of the correct rule of law. Est. of Klink ex rel. Klink v. State, 113 Hawai# i 
332, 351, 152 P.3d 504, 523 (2007). 
3. The circuit court did not abuse its 
discretion in denying Ibarra's motionfor a new trial. 
On appeal, Ibarra asserts in a conclusory manner that 
the circuit court abused its discretion in denying her motion for 
a new trial because: (1) "[CW] had lied under oath on numerous occasions"; and (2) "the jury appeared to have reached a 'compromise verdict' to punish Ibarra for her admissions that she was engaging in prostitution and that she had lied to Ferreira to conceal her prostitution activities." The granting or denial of a motion for new trial is within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed absent a clear abuse of discretion. State v. Hicks, 113 Hawai# i 60, 69, 148 P.3d 493, 
502 (2006). 
Ibarra's first contention lacks merit. It is well 
settled that credibility determinations are the province of the jury. Fisher v. Fisher, 111 Hawai# i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 
(2006) ("It is well-settled that an appellate court will not pass upon issues dependent upon the credibility of witnesses and the 
6  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
weight of evidence; this is the province of the trier of fact.") 
(citation omitted). 
For her second contention, the only evidence Ibarra 
cites is a portion of her testimony elicited during cross-examination in which she admits that she participated in prostitution and lied to her boyfriend about it.
5 Ibarra did not 
object below and similar testimony was elicited on direct examination. The circuit court instructed the jury that if they found Ibarra not guilty of Sex Trafficking, or could not reach a unanimous verdict, then they must consider the included offense of Promoting Prostitution. "A jury is presumed to follow the court's instructions." State v. Webster, 94 Hawai# i 241, 248, 11 
P.3d 466, 473 (2000) (citations omitted). As discussed above, substantial evidence was adduced at trial to support the jury's finding that Ibarra was guilty of Promoting Prostitution. 
Thus, 
the circuit court did not abuse its discretion by denying Ibarra's motion for a new trial. 
For the foregoing reasons, the Judgment entered by the 
circuit court on September 11, 2019, is affirmed.

not assert prosecutorial misconduct as a point of error, nor does she make anysuch arguments on appeal. See Rule 28(b)(4) of the Hawai #i Rules of Appellate
Procedure ("Points not presented in accordance with this section will bedisregarded, except that the appellate court, at its option, may notice aplain error not presented.").
