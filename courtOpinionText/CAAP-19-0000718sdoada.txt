On April 1, 2019, Rios was charged by Complaint with 
Operating a Vehicle After License and Privilege Have Been 
Suspended or Revoked for Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence 
of an Intoxicant (OVLPSR-OVUII), in violation of Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS) § 291E-62(a)(1) and/or (a)(2) (Supp. 2019). 2/
Rios raises a single point of error on appeal, 
contending that there was not substantial evidence to support his 
conviction. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve Rios's point of error as follows: 
The Hawai# i Supreme Court has long held: 
[E]vidence adduced in the trial court must be considered in
the strongest light for the prosecution when the appellatecourt passes on the legal sufficiency of such evidence tosupport a conviction; the same standard applies whether thecase was before a judge or a jury. The test on appeal isnot whether guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt, 
HRS § 291E-62(a) provides, in relevant part: 
§ 291E-62 Operating a vehicle after license and
privilege have been suspended or revoked for operating a
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant; penalties.
(a) No person whose license and privilege to operate a
vehicle have been revoked, suspended, or otherwiserestricted pursuant to this section or to part III orsection 291E-61 or 291E-61.5, or to part VII or part XIV ofchapter 286 or section 200-81, 291-4, 291-4.4, 291-4.5, or291-7 as those provisions were in effect on December 31,2001, shall operate or assume actual physical control of anyvehicle: 
(1) In violation of any restrictions placed on theperson's license; 
(2) While the person's license or privilege tooperate a vehicle remains suspended orrevoked[.] 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
but whether there was substantial evidence to support the
conclusion of the trier of fact. Indeed, even if it couldbe said in a bench trial that the conviction is against theweight of the evidence, as long as there is substantialevidence to support the requisite findings for conviction,the trial court will be affirmed. 
"Substantial evidence" as to every material
element of the offense charged is credible evidencewhich is of sufficient quality and probative value toenable [a person] of reasonable caution to support aconclusion. And as trier of fact, the trial judge isfree to make all reasonable and rational inferences under the facts in evidence, including circumstantialevidence. 
State v. Batson, 73 Haw. 236, 248-49, 831 P.2d 924, 931(1992). 
State v. Matavale, 115 Hawai# i 149, 157-58, 166 P.3d 322, 330-31 
(2007). 
Rios argues that the State of Hawai# i (State) failed to 
adduce substantial evidence that (a) Rios was the person 
identified in the exhibits purporting to establish that his license was revoked, and/or (b) Rios recklessly operated his vehicle while his license was revoked. 
Rios cites State v. Pantoja, 89 Hawai# i 492, 974 P.2d 
1082 (App. 1999), a case in which this court examined the sufficiency of the evidence identifying the defendant as the same person who was previously convicted of the relevant offense. 
In 
Pantoja, we noted that the fact that a defendant has the same name as the previously convicted individual is insufficient and there must be other evidence tying the defendant to the prior conviction. Id.
 at 495, 974 P.2d at 1085 (citing State v. Nishi, 
9 Haw. App. 516, 528, 852 P.2d 476, 482 (1993)). 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Here, Honolulu Police Department (HPD) Officer Mark 
Borowski (Officer Borowski) testified that he stopped Rios, Rios 
handed the officer an expired permit, and Rios admitted that he 
did not have a license. Officer Borowski also identified Rios in court as the person stopped and arrested. HPD Officer Arlene Ah 
You (Officer Ah You) testified that she was involved with Rios's 
prior arrest for Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an 
Intoxicant (OVUII) and identified Rios in court. Officer Ah You 
testified that, in conjunction with Rios's OVUII arrest, she 
personally read the Notice of Administrative Revocation form 
(Revocation Form) to Rios and both she and Rios signed the form. 
The Revocation Form was admitted into evidence, along with a 
certified Traffic Abstract generated on April 5, 2019 (Abstract), 
and a certified copy of the September 27, 2018 ADLRO 
Administrative Review Decision (Decision). The Abstract 
contains, inter alia, Rios's name, driver's license number, 
social security number, and date of birth, as do the Decision and 
the Revocation Form. This evidence, along with the two officers' testimony, was sufficient evidence to identify Rios as the same person whose license was revoked. 
Rios also argues that the State failed to adduce 
substantial evidence that he was aware that his license had been revoked. The state of mind required to establish an offense under HRS § 291E-62(a)(1) is not specified and, therefore, is 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
established if a person acts intentionally, knowingly, or 
recklessly. HRS § 702-204 (2014). 
"A person acts recklessly with respect to attendant 
circumstances when he consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances exist." HRS § 702-206(3)(b) (2014). 
A risk is substantial and unjustifiable within the meaning
of this section if, considering the nature and purpose ofthe person's conduct and the circumstances known to him, thedisregard of the risk involves a gross deviation from thestandard of conduct that a law-abiding person would observein the same situation. 
HRS § 702-206(3)(d) (2014). 
Circumstantial evidence and reasonable inferences 
arising from the evidence of a defendant's acts, conduct, and all 
of the circumstances may be sufficient to establish the requisite state of mind. See, e.g., State v. Eastman, 81 Hawai# i 131, 141, 
913 P.2d 57, 67 (1996). 
Here, Officer Ah You testified that, on September 22, 
2018, she read the Revocation Form to Rios and that he acknowledged that he received it and signed the form. The Revocation Form indicated that Rios was arrested for OVUII, and that Rios was unlicensed or his license was expired, as well as that a decision as to whether his license and privilege to operate a vehicle in the State would be administratively revoked would be mailed to him not later than eight days after the date 
of issuance of the Notice, i.e., the Revocation Form. Thus, Rios consciously disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk that 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
his license was revoked when he drove his car five months later 
when he was stopped and arrested by Officer Borowski. Accordingly, even though there was no direct evidence that Rios was aware that his license had been revoked, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence that Rios consciously disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk that his license was revoked to support his conviction for OVLPSR-OVUII. 
For these reasons, the District Court's September 24, 
2019 Judgment and November 7, 2019 Amended Judgment are affirmed.
