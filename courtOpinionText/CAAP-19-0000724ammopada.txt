DAVID T. PREBLE, also known as
David Taofiaualii Preble, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1PC990002363 (CR. NO. 99-2363)) 
AMENDED MEMORANDUM OPINION 
(By: Ginoza, C.J., and Hiraoka, and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant David T. Preble, also known as 
David Taofiaualii Preble (Preble), appeals from the Third Amended 
Judgment of Conviction and Sentence (
Third Amended Judgment), 
entered on September 24, 2019, in the Circuit Court of the First 
Circuit (
circuit court).1/ 
After Preble was convicted, sentenced, and exhausted 
his appeals, he filed a petition for post-conviction relief pursuant to Hawai# i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40.  He 
later amended his petition to contend that his extended-term sentences were "illegal sentences" under Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 446 (2000).  In June 2018, the Hawai# i Supreme Court 
vacated Preble's extended-term sentences, ruling that they were imposed in an illegal manner because a judge, rather than a jury, made the required finding that Preble's extended-term sentences were necessary for protection of the public.  Preble v. State, No. SCWC-14-0000531, 2018 WL 3203435, at *1-2 (Haw. June 29, 
1/ The Honorable Edward H. Kubo, Jr. presided.  
  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2018) (2018 SDO).  On remand, the circuit court resentenced 
Preble on the multiple counts for which he was convicted, and he 
now appeals the new sentence.  
In this appeal, Preble contends that the circuit court 
erred in imposing consecutive rather than concurrent sentences on remand because:  (1) concurrent terms were the law of the case; (2) reconsideration of the issue of consecutive terms was a violation of Preble's right to due process and trial by jury; (3) Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai# i (State) waived the issue of 
consecutive sentences; and (4) consecutive terms of imprisonment should not be imposed without supporting findings by a jury. Additionally, in his reply brief, Preble argues in the alternative that this case should be remanded for a recalculation of credit for time served pursuant to the supreme court's recent decision in State v. Thompson, No. SCWC-17-0000427, 2020 WL 2846618 (Haw. June 1, 2020) (SDO).
2/ 
For the reasons set forth below, we vacate the Third 
Amended Judgment solely as to the resentencing imposed therein, and remand for further resentencing proceedings, including an accurate calculation of Preble's credit for time served, consistent with this Memorandum Opinion and Thompson. 
I. Background 
This case has a long history, which is described in 
detail in the supreme court's 2018 SDO and our 2017 decision, Preble v. State, No. CAAP-14-0000531, 2017 WL 1050339, at *1 (Haw. App. Mar. 17, 2017) (2017 SDO) (vacated in part by the 2018 
SDO).  
In brief, a jury found Preble guilty in 2001 of eleven 
counts of sexually assaulting three sisters, when each was under 
the age of fourteen.

parties each to file, within 20 days of the date of the order, a supplemental
brief addressing the import of the Thompson decision to this appeal.  Preble and the State filed their respective supplemental briefs on May 16 and May 17,2021, respectively.

verdict.

first-degree sexual assault, in violation of Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS) ยง 707-730(1)(b) (1993) (a class A felony), and 
eight counts of third-degree sexual assault, in violation of HRS 
ยง 707-732(1)(b) (1993) (a class C felony).  
As we described in the 2017 SDO: 
[The State] moved for extended terms of imprisonment on the
ground that Preble was a multiple offender whose commitmentfor extended terms was necessary for protection of thepublic.  The Circuit Court granted the motion, finding,among other things, that extended terms for the protectionof the public were warranted because Preble's assaultivebehavior had continued unabated for twenty years from thetime he was a juvenile; there was documented evidence of hismethamphetamine use; and his assaultive behavior was of anextreme nature and included a 1991 conviction for second-degree robbery, which involved his beating of a73-year-old man, and his sexual assault of three minor girlsunder the age of fourteen in the pending case. 
Preble, 2017 WL 1050339, at *1 (footnote omitted).  The circuit 
court sentenced Preble to a term of twenty years, extended to life with the possibility of parole, for each of the class A felony convictions, and a term of five years, extended to ten years, for each of the class C felony convictions.  Id. The circuit court "ran these terms concurrently with each other, but consecutively to the ten-year term for second-degree robbery that Preble was still serving."   Id.

We further explained in the 2017 SDO:  
The Circuit Court entered its amended judgment on
November 19, 2001, and Preble filed a direct appeal.  In a 
summary disposition order issued on December 3, 2004, thiscourt affirmed the Circuit Court's amended judgment.  State v. Preble, No. 24680, 2004 WL 2757909 (Hawai #i App. Dec. 3, 
2004).  In our decision, we addressed and rejected Preble'sclaims that:  (1) the Circuit Court erred in denying hismotion to dismiss the indictment for pre-indictment delay;(2) Preble's right to a speedy trial under [HRPP] Rule 48. . . had been violated; (3) Preble's trial counsel wasineffective for failing to move to dismiss the indictmentbased on the destruction of evidence favorable to the defense, namely, pubic hair, vaginal swabs, and bloodsamples taken from one of the complaining witnesses; (4)Preble's trial counsel was ineffective in failing to move todismiss the indictment based on the statute of limitations;(5) Preble's trial counsel was ineffective for failing to

7/ 
Preble filed his notice of appeal on October 23, 2019. 
II. Discussion 
A. Law of the Case 
Preble contends that the imposition of consecutive 
sentences was barred by the law of the case, because the Hawai# i 
Supreme Court was "very specific in vacating only the portion of 
Preble's sentence pertaining to the extended term of 
circumstances) 
4. Because of the extenuating circumstances, namely, the
nature of the victimization to [JHR] (i.e., grooming,intimidation, threats, blackmail, lies, and using herto springboard his evil desires on the other 2sisters), the length of her victimization (3 years),and the degree of sexual and emotional damage done to[JHR], Counts 15 and 16 shall be separated from Counts7, 12 and 13, and shall also be consecutive to Counts1 and 2 (CW [JLR]), Counts 3 to 6 (CW [JPR]), and toCounts 7, 12 and 13 (CW [JHR]) because dividing[JHR]'s Counts in this manner will more realisticallyreflect the seriousness of the offenses committed to her and provide just punishment[.] 
The circuit court further ordered that "[t]his case shall run consecutively toany other sentence that [Preble] served." 
7/ FOFs/COLs 36 through 39 clarify the structure of the new sentence 
as follows: 
36. The Court has the discretion to make the 
punishment fit the crime as well as the needs of theindividual defendant in this community.  Thus, this Court will impose consecutive sentencing. 
37. The grouping shall be per victim. 
38. Counts 1 & 2, involving JLR, shall run
concurrently to each other, but consecutively to Counts 3
through 6 involving JPR.  At the time of these offenses, JPR was ten years of age.  Counts 7, 12 and 13 shall runconcurrently to each other, but consecutively to theaforementioned counts. 
39. Because JHR suffered the most damage and the most
prolonged sexual abuse in this matter, and given thegrooming that took place, the intimidation, the lies and thedeception/blackmail to remain silent, Counts 15 and 16 willbe grouped separately and run consecutively to all of theaforementioned counts.

imprisonment" and "[t]he order clearly and distinctly limits any 
reconsideration of Preble's sentence to the issue of extended terms of imprisonment."  (Capitalization altered.)  Preble asserts that "[t]he circuit court simply ignored the Supreme Court's order and directions and proceeded to . . . consider a new motion for repeat offender and the issue of consecutive sentences which had never before been raised by the state."
8/ 
According to Preble, "[t]he circuit court had no discretion [to] reconsider the concurrent terms of imprisonment," which had been determined by the original sentencing judge.  
The State, on the other hand, argues that "the Hawai# i 
Supreme Court neither explicitly [n]or implicitly ruled on whether consecutive sentencing was appropriate in this case."  According to the State: 
[The supreme court's] legal decision with respect to the
sentence in this case was only as to whether extended-termsentencing was legal absent jury found facts.  Nor did the trial court previously rule on this issue because at thetime that Preble was sentenced it was assumed that extended-term sentencing was available. 
Thus, the State asserts, "there was no 'law of the case' to 
follow" with respect to consecutive-term sentencing.  The State further argues that even if the original sentencing judge had declined to apply consecutive terms, "the Hawai# i Supreme Court's 
decision that extended-term sentencing was illegal absent jury found facts and the jury's subsequent determination that an extended-term sentence was not necessary were a fundamental change in the facts that the circuit court could . . . take into account." 
The Hawai# i Supreme Court has described the law of the 
case doctrine as follows: 
The law of the case doctrine holds that "a determination of 
a question of law made by an appellate court in the courseof an action becomes the law of the case and may not bedisputed by a reopening of the question at a later stage ofthe litigation."  Fought & Co. v. Steel Eng'g & Erection, 
8/ Preble does not challenge the circuit court's ruling on the
State's motion to sentence Preble as a repeat offender pursuant to HRS 706-606.5.  The court concluded that it "w[ould] not disturb" the ruling of theoriginal sentencing judge, which granted the State's original motion tosentence Preble as a repeat offender.

have been decided either expressly or by necessaryimplication."  Id. In other words, "the usual practice of

City & Cty.Of Honolulu, 66 Haw. 389, 396, 665 P.2d 157, 162 (1983)(emphasis omitted).  Consequently, the "law of the case"doctrine "does not preclude modification of a prior rulingin all instances."

Hussey v. Say, 139 Hawai# i 181, 185, 384 P.3d 1282, 1286 (2016). 
In State v. Thompson, this court rejected the 
defendant's argument that the law of the case doctrine precluded 
the circuit court from imposing consecutive sentences upon resentencing, where the "original judge had imposed concurrent, not consecutive, sentences."  No. CAAP-17-0000427, 2018 WL 4611273, at *6 (Haw. App. Sept. 26, 2018), vacated on other grounds, 2020 WL 2846628 (Haw. June 1, 2020).  We reasoned that 
the original sentencing judge concluded that consecutive
terms were not necessary because [the defendant] hadreceived multiple life sentences.  When the life sentences were set aside, it resulted in a change of fact thataffected [the defendant's] resentencing that the originalsentencing judge did not consider. 
Id.  We concluded "there were cogent reasons to support granting 
consecutive terms during resentencing."  Id. 
Here, as an initial matter, the supreme court's 2018 
SDO did not preclude the circuit court's imposition of consecutive sentences on remand.  The only sentencing issue raised and decided in Preble's previous appeal was whether his extended-term sentences were imposed in an illegal manner because they violated Apprendi, as construed by the supreme court in Flubacher.  Accordingly, in concluding that Preble's extended-term sentences were improperly imposed for that reason, the supreme court vacated the relevant decisions of this court and the circuit court "solely relating to extended sentences." Preble, 2018 WL 3203435, at *2.  The supreme court thus did not rule on whether consecutive sentencing was appropriate in this case.  Absent "a determination of [this] question of law," the 
8   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
supreme court established no "law of the case" that precluded the 
circuit court from imposing consecutive sentences on remand. Hussey, 139 Hawai# i at 185, 384 P.3d at 1286. 
Further, as in Thompson, the original sentencing 
judge's decision to impose extended terms rather than consecutive terms did not preclude the circuit court from imposing consecutive terms on remand, following the supreme court's 2018 SDO.  The original sentencing judge declined to impose consecutive terms  based on the implicit premise that extended-
term sentencing was legal and available without jury findings. Specifically, during Preble's original sentencing hearing, the circuit court stated in relevant part: 
9/
The court finds that consecutive sentencing in
this case with respect to each of the counts is
nonsensical because it totals up to one hundred 40years. 
And the life sentence in itself is more 
reasonable under the circumstances. 
So with respect to counts 7, 12 and 13, based on
the evidence that all offenses the defendant has committed are against people, the court finds thatdefendant is a danger to the public and extends tolife terms[.]  [I]n counts 1 to 6 and counts l5 and 
9/ While the State had not sought consecutive-term sentencing,
defense counsel argued in part as follows during Preble's sentencing hearing: 
Essentially, Your Honor, it's our position that the
Court did not necessarily have to impose the extended termbecause the Court was well aware, if the Court wants toimplement a term of incarcer[a]tion for Mr. Preble, it hasas its option to essentially what would amount to a lifeterm.  In any event, by sentencing him to a consecutive term. 
Apparently, he's been convicted of three Class A
felonies.  Plus, he has a number of Class C, and the Courtknows that you can impose a consecutive sentence on thiswhich would equal [a] hundred years. 
THE COURT: State has not asked for consecutive term. 
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your honor, State doesn't have to
ask for consecutive for the Court to impose that sentence,
seems to me. 
. . . . 
. . . Because if you are inclined to give him life,
you have at your option imposing a consecutive term.  I am not advocating the Court do that.  I am essentiallyadvocating that the imposition of an extended term is notnecessary. 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 16[,] [t]hose are also offenses against people and the
court extends the terms to ten years. 
When these extended terms, including the life sentences, were 
later set aside, and the jury on remand found that the State had not proven that extended terms were necessary for protection of the public, the circuit court faced changed circumstances, i.e., the fact that extended sentencing was not available.  In these new circumstances, as in Thompson, there were cogent reasons for the circuit court to consider imposing consecutive terms upon resentencing. 
In particular, the circuit court made the following 
findings and conclusions, among others, supporting its decision to impose consecutive terms: 
29. Under the circumstances, given the gross and
vicious nature of this case and the uncaring, devilish and
damaged character of the defendant, it is clear that atwenty year sentence is nowhere near sufficient. 
30. A twenty year sentence is nowhere near sufficient
to reflect the seriousness of the instant offenses, promoterespect for the law, provide just punishment in this case orprovide both specific and general deterrence to this type ofcriminal conduct. 
31. Imposition of consecutive terms is necessary for
the protection of the public from further crimes of theDefendant. 
. . . . 
35.
 The Court has evaluated and considered the kinds 
of sentences that are available to address this case, and ithas also a need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparitieswith other defendants with similar records who have been convicted of similar conduct all the while acknowledgingthat this is one of the worst child sexual abuse cases the Court has seen with no remorse on the part of the Defendant. This diminishes the likelihood of successful rehabilitation and only increases the chance of him doing this act again inthe future. 
. . . . 
40.
 Defendant's continued refusal to undergo
therapeutic rehabilitation for his sexual deviancy increasesthe likelihood of recidivism to such an extent that it becomes a very important factor for this Court nowundertaking a change in direction from the prior judge. 
Given the changed circumstances upon resentencing, and 
the facts found by the circuit court, we conclude that the law of 
the case doctrine did not bar the imposition of consecutive sentences.  See Wong, 66 Haw. at 396, 665 P.2d at 162; Thompson, 2018 WL 4611273, at *6.  However, for the reasons discussed in 
10 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 Section D below, it was error for the circuit court to impose the 
new sentences without an accurate calculation of appropriate credit for time served as set forth in Thompson. 
B. Due Process and Trial by Jury 
Because Preble's second and fourth points of error 
assert violations of his constitutional rights to due process and 
trial by jury, we consider these points together. 
In his fourth point of error, Preble contends that the 
"imposition of consecutive terms of imprisonment by a judge without supporting jury findings of fact is a denial of his rights to trial by jury and due process as guaranteed by Article I, Section 5 and 14 of the Hawaii State Constitution."  We reject this argument for the reasons discussed in State v. Amaral, Nos. CAAP-19-0000487, CAAP-19-0000488, and CAAP-19-0000489, 2020 WL 3397962, at *3 (Haw. App. June 19, 2020), and Thompson, 2018 WL 4611273, at *4-5.  
In brief, the United States Supreme Court in Oregon v. 
Ice, 555 U.S. 160, 167-68 (2009), and the Hawai# i Supreme Court 
in State v. Kahapea, 111 Hawai# i 267, 279-80, 141 P.3d 440, 
452-53 (2006), have held that Apprendi does not apply to the determination of consecutive sentences.  "As noted in Kahapea, Apprendi does not apply to a sentencing judge's fact finding to impose consecutive sentences under [HRS] ยง 706-668.5 (1993), which entails consideration of the factors set forth in HRS ยง 706-606 (1993)."  Amaral, 2020 WL 3397962, at *3.  "Although consecutive sentences may lengthen the term of incarceration beyond the statutory maximum for an individual sentence, none of the individual terms of imprisonment exceed the applicable statutory maximum."  Id. In Kahapea, where the defendant was 
convicted of five first-degree thefts and sentenced to ten years for each, the Hawai# i Supreme Court explained that the sentence 
of "five ten-year terms running consecutively is the statutory 
maximum[,]" and did not deprive the defendant of his rights under Apprendi
.  Id.
 at 280, 141 P.3d at 453. 
Here, as in Kahapea, Preble's consecutive sentences 
resulted in a term of imprisonment beyond the twenty-year 
11 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
statutory maximum for one count of sexual assault in the first 
degree.  See HRS ยง 706-659 (1993).  However, none of Preble's individual prison terms exceeded the statutory maximum for the offense involved.  Thus, the circuit court's imposition of consecutive prison terms did not deprive Preble of his constitutional right to a trial by jury. 
In his second point of error, Preble contends that 
"reconsideration of the issue of consecutive terms by [the circuit court] was a violation of Preble's right to due process and trial by jury."  (Capitalization altered.)  Preble argues that the issue of whether to impose consecutive or concurrent terms was decided by the original sentencing judge over twenty years ago, resulting in a judgment that was appealed and affirmed, such that the circuit court could not reconsider the imposition of concurrent sentences.   
Preble's constitutional challenge to the court's 
"reconsideration" of consecutive terms suffers from the same defects as his law-of-the-case argument.  Most notably, the original sentencing judge declined to impose consecutive terms based on the premise that extended-term sentencing was legal and available without jury findings, i.e., circumstances that changed with the issuance of the 2018 SDO.  Moreover, on direct appeal of the 2001 amended judgment, this court did not rule on whether concurrent or consecutive sentencing was appropriate.  Similarly, in the 2018 SDO, the supreme court did not rule on the issue of consecutive sentencing.  On remand and resentencing, the circuit court made detailed findings supporting its decision to impose consecutive sentences.  Preble cites no authority supporting his argument that the court's consideration of consecutive terms under these circumstances violates a defendant's rights to due process and trial by jury. 
Instead, Preble relies on what he characterizes as 
"dicta" in State v. Hussein, 122 Hawai# i 495, 509, 229 P.3d 313, 
327 (2010), supporting his argument that consecutive-term sentencing "may be a ruse to avoid the more burdensome procedure of imposing extended terms and thereby violate a defendant's right to due process[.]"  Preble cites a portion of Hussein that

relies in turn on a discussion in the concurring opinion in 
Kahapea, 111 Hawai# i at 285, 141 P.3d at 458.  See Hussein, 112 
Hawai# i at 508, 229 P.3d at 326.  However, the prevailing law 
under Ice and Kapahea is that Apprendi does not apply to a trial court's determination of consecutive sentencing.
10/  See supra. 
Accordingly, we conclude that the circuit court's 
imposition of consecutive prison terms did not violate Preble's constitutional rights to due process and trial by jury.  However, for the reasons discussed in Section D below, it was error for the circuit court to impose the new sentences without an accurate calculation of appropriate credit for time served as set forth in Thompson. 
C.  Waiver 
Preble contends that because the State did not raise 
the issue of consecutive prison terms at Preble's original 
sentencing, "the State waived the issue of consecutive sentences." (Capitalization altered.)  Neither Preble nor the State cites to any case law supporting their respective contentions regarding waiver.  However, the State argues that "[b]ecause the facts on remand were significantly different from when Preble was originally sentenced, the State has never waived or forfeited any right to ask for consecutive sentencing in this case." 
Initially, we note that this is not a situation in 
which the State waived an issue on appeal because it failed to raise the issue in the trial court, and the trial court did not consider or rule on the issue.  Here, the original sentencing judge appears to have considered imposing consecutive terms in response to Preble's argument during his original sentencing hearing.  Moreover, upon remand pursuant to the 2018 SDO, the State raised the issue of consecutive-term sentencing with the 
10/  Furthermore, in Hussein, the supreme court held that "henceforth,
the circuit court must state its reasons for imposing a consecutive as opposed
to a concurrent sentence under HRS ยง 706โ668.5 (Supp. 2008) or HRS ยง706โ606.5[.]"  122 Hawai #i at 498, 229 P.3d at 316 (footnote omitted).  This 
is precisely what the circuit court did here in imposing consecutive termsupon resentencing.

circuit court, which considered the arguments of each side in 
determining Preble's new sentence, as reflected in the FOFs/COLs. Thus, Preble's argument is that the State was precluded from raising the issue of consecutive-term sentencing in the circuit court on remand because the State did not raise the issue in Preble's original sentencing proceeding.  In other words, Preble's position is that in order to preserve the issue of consecutive-term sentencing, the State, at the time of Preble's original sentencing, had to request consecutive terms either in 
lieu of extended terms, or in addition to extended terms, 
potentially resulting in consecutive life terms. 
We have found no authority requiring the State to make 
such a choice in these circumstances in order to preserve the 
issue of consecutive-term sentencing.  It appears that at the time of Preble's original sentencing, the State and the court assumed that extended-term sentencing was available without jury findings, such that the State could reasonably have considered a request for consecutive prison terms as unnecessary.  On this record, where the parties and the circuit court faced significantly changed circumstances related to sentencing upon remand, we cannot conclude that the State's decision not to request consecutive prison terms at the time of Preble's original sentencing constituted a waiver of the issue. 
D.  Credit for Time Served 
In his reply brief, Preble argues for the first time, 
in the alternative, that if this court does not vacate the Third 
Amended Judgment and remand the case for entry of a new judgment imposing concurrent terms of imprisonment, the court should remand the case for a "recalculation of credit for time served pursuant to the Supreme Court['s] decision in Thompson[, 2020 WL 2846618, at *2]."

An argument not raised in the opening brief cannot be 
raised for the first time in a reply brief, and such argument is

ordinarily deemed waived.  See State v. Mark, 123 Hawai# i 205, 
230, 231 P.3d 478, 503 (2010) (citing In re Hawaiian Flour Mills, 
Inc., 76 Hawai# i 1, 14 n.5, 868 P.2d 419, 432 n.5 (1994)); HRAP 
Rule 28(d) (providing that "[t]he reply brief shall be confined to matters presented in the answering brief").  This waiver is not absolute and is subject to the court's inherent authority to address plain error and without prejudice to an HRPP Rule 40 petition for post-conviction relief in appropriate circumstances. See Mark, 123 Hawai# i at 230, 231 P.3d at 503 (noting that 
appellate courts may address plain error raised in a reply brief); Briones v. State, 74 Haw. 442, 459-60, 848 P.2d 966, 975 (1993) (explaining that issues of ineffective assistance of both trial and appellate counsel may be raised in a HRPP Rule 40 petition for post-conviction relief, in certain situations). Accordingly, this court allowed the parties each to file a supplemental brief addressing the import of the Thompson decision to this appeal, which both parties did.  See supra note 2. 
In Thompson, the Hawai# i Supreme Court ruled in part: 
When the defendant has accrued time served against multiple
crimes, the wording of HRS ยง 706-671(2)12/ suggests that on
resentencing for those same crimes, the defendant isentitled to credit against each of those same crimes, ratherthan only once against the aggregate of the consecutivesentences. 
2020 WL 2846618 at *2 (footnote added).  In Thompson, the 
defendant was sentenced in 2001 to concurrent terms of imprisonment.  Id. at *1.  Upon resentencing in 2017, the circuit court imposed a consecutive sentence comprising four elements: three twenty-year terms and a single one-year term to be served consecutively, for a total sentence of sixty-one years imprisonment.  Id. "The circuit court indicated that [the 
defendant's] credit for time served under his 2001 sentence would be applied only once against the first of his three consecutive twenty-year terms," rather than to each of the offenses 
12/ Under HRS ยง 706-671(2), "[w]hen a judgment of conviction or a
sentence is vacated and a new sentence is thereafter imposed upon the
defendant for the same crime, the period of detention and imprisonmenttheretofore served shall be deducted from the minimum and maximum terms of the new sentence." 
15 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
comprising his 2017 resentence.  Id. The supreme court ruled 
that "[a]bsent credit for time already served on each count of his 2001 sentence, [the defendant] would be subjected to unconstitutional 'multiple punishments' for the same offense." Id. at *3 (quoting State v. Taparra, 82 Hawai# i 83, 89, 919 P.2d 
995, 1001 (App. 1996)).  The supreme court thus vacated this court's judgment, which had affirmed the circuit court, and remanded the case to the circuit court "for an accurate calculation of [the defendant's] credit for time served."  Id. at*4.  
Here, upon resentencing in 2019, the circuit court did 
not indicate Preble's credit for time served under his original 2001 sentence, instead concluding that "[c]redit for time served shall be determined by the Department of Public Safety [DPS]."  
Acknowledging this aspect of the resentencing, the State asserts 
in its supplemental brief: 
It is not clear from the record exactly how much credit for
time served is due to Preble and how the Department ofPublic Safety is applying that credit for time served.  The State would merely suggest that this is an issue that ismore appropriately decided at the trial court level wherethe record can be supplemented if necessary.  If Preble believes that credit for time served is not being applied asthe Hawai #i Supreme Court explained in [Thompson,] then
Preble should be free to raise that before the trial court on remand.  However, the State respectfully requests thiscourt to affirm Preble's consecutive sentences. 
Preble, on the other hand, contends in his supplemental 
brief: 
[A]t the time of resentencing, September 24, 2019, Preblehad completely served his maximum terms of imprisonment forall of his Class C felonies and had served either 19 years 6months and 22 days or 19 years 9 months and 13 days,depending on whether or not he is given credit for theperiod between July 27, 2001 and October 16, 2001 on each  of 
his three Class A felonies.  Thus, Preble had not less than5 months and 8 days remaining to be served on his Class Afelonies. 
. . . . 
. . . [A]ssuming [the Class A felonies] were all to be
served consecutively with each other, Preble served hismaximum terms of imprisonment on all Class A felonies notlater than August 17, 2020. 
(Capitalization altered.) 
16 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The record does not contain all of the facts supporting 
Preble's calculations of credit for time served.  In addition, 
neither Preble nor the State cites any part of the record reflecting DPS's determination of Preble's credit for time served.  Having reviewed the record, we cannot discern precisely how much time Preble has served on his original sentence.  But this much is clear from the record:  Preble's original 2001 sentence included concurrent five-year terms, extended to concurrent ten-year terms, for each of the eight Class C felony convictions, and concurrent twenty-year terms, extended to concurrent life terms, for each of the three Class A felony convictions.  Those concurrent terms were to be served consecutively to the 10โyear term (with credit for time served) that was imposed in 1994 for Preble's second-degree robbery conviction.  See supra note 6.  Given the passage of time, it appears that Preble had been imprisoned in the current case for a substantial number of years when he was resentenced in 2019. Under Thompson, Preble must be given credit for time served on each count of his 2001 sentence, including counts he had fully served.  See 2020 WL 2846618 at *3; see also State v. Johnson, 68 Haw. 292, 297, 711 P.2d 1295, 1299 (1985) ("Without express legislative authority, the court cannot delegate the sentencing function to another person or entity.") 
Because under Thompson, the circuit court's error in 
failing to calculate credit for time served affected Preble's substantial rights, i.e., his constitutional guarantee against multiple punishments for the same offense, we exercise our discretion to review for plain error.  See HRPP Rule 52(b); State v. Ui, 142 Hawai# i 287, 298, 418 P.3d 628, 639 (2018).  Applying 
the supreme court's Thompson decision, we conclude that the circuit court plainly erred. 
III. Conclusion 
For the reasons discussed above, we vacate the Third 
Amended Judgment of Conviction and Sentence, entered on September 24, 2019, in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit, solely as to the resentencing of Preble, to the extent the Third 
17 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Amended Judgment of Conviction and Sentence failed to give Preble 
credit for time served on his original sentence.  We remand for further resentencing proceedings, including an accurate calculation of Preble's credit for time served, consistent with this Memorandum Opinion and Thompson.
