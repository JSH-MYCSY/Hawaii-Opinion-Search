IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
DAVID T. PREBLE, also known as
David Taofiaualii Preble, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1PC990002363 (CR. NO. 99-2363)) 
ORDER GRANTING IN PART MOTION FOR CLARIFICATION 
(By: Ginoza, C.J., and Hiraoka, and Wadsworth, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the June 24, 2021 Motion for 
Clarification (Motion for Clarification) filed by Plaintiff-
Appellee State of 
Hawai#i (State), which we construe in part as a 
motion for reconsideration pursuant to Hawai
#i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 40,1/ and the record, it appears that: 
(1) On June 16, 2021, this court issued its Memorandum 
Opinion in this appeal. The conclusion of the Memorandum 
Opinion, starting at the bottom of page 17 and continuing onto the top of page 18, states in part: "[W]e vacate the Third Amended Judgment of Conviction and Sentence [(Judgment)], entered 
on September 24, 2019, in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit, 
solely as to the resentencing of [Defendant-Appellant David] Preble [(Preble)], and remand for further resentencing 
proceedings, including an accurate calculation of Preble's credit 
1/ On July 2, 2021, this court issued an Order Suspending Time
Requirement, under which the time in which this court must dispose of the
Motion for Clarification was extended to July 15, 2021.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
for time served, consistent with this Memorandum Opinion and 
[State v. ]Thompson[, No. SCWC-17-0000427, 2020 WL 2846618 (Haw. June 1, 2020) (SDO)]." 
(2) In the Motion for Clarification, the State asserts: 
In State v. Thompson, this Court affirmed the circuit
court's judgment of conviction and sentence. However, on
application for writ of certiorari, the Hawai #i Supreme
Court vacated this Court's judgment on appeal and remandedthe case to the circuit court for an accurate calculation of Thompson's credit for time served. 
At no time did the 
Hawai #i Supreme Court vacate the circuit court's sentence or
order resentencing. The Hawai #i Supreme Court simply
ordered the circuit court to perform an accurate calculationof Thompson's credit for time served. 
(Footnotes omitted.) Accordingly, the State "ask[s] this Court 
to clarify that in this case, as in Thompson, this Court is affirming the circuit court's judgment of conviction and sentence, but ordering the circuit court to perform an accurate calculation of Preble's credit for time served." 
(3) The Judgment in this case states in part: "Total 
35 years jail with credit and any credit for time served shall be determined by State Department of Public Safety." For the reasons stated in the Memorandum Opinion, the Judgment as to Preble's resentencing thus failed to give Preble credit for the time he served on his original 2001 sentence, as required under Thompson. The Judgment was thus properly vacated as to Preble's resentencing, to the extent the Judgment failed to give Preble credit for time served on his original sentence. The Memorandum Opinion was not intended to vacate other aspects of Preble's resentencing. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion for Clarification 
is granted in part. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the last paragraph of the 
Memorandum Opinion, starting at the bottom of page 17 and continuing onto the top of page 18, shall be corrected to read: 
For the reasons discussed above, we vacate the Third
Amended Judgment of Conviction and Sentence, entered on
September 24, 2019, in the Circuit Court of the FirstCircuit, solely as to the resentencing of Preble, to theextent the Third Amended Judgment of Conviction and Sentencefailed to give Preble credit for time served on his originalsentence. We remand for further resentencing proceedings,

including an accurate calculation of Preble's credit for
time served, consistent with this Memorandum Opinion andThompson. 
The Amended Memorandum Opinion is being filed simultaneously. 
The Motion for Clarification is denied in all other 
respects.
