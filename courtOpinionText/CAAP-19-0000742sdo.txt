 (circuit court ).1  The Judgment was entered in favor of 
Plaintiffs /Counterclaim Defendants/Third -Party Defendants -
Appellees Kenneth Y. Kai and Tae K. Kai, Trustees of the Kai 
Family 1998 Trust (Kai Trust ).   
Miroyan argues two points of error on appeal.  Upon 
careful review of the record and relevant legal authorities, and 
having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the 
issues raised by the parties, we resolve Miroyan's points of 
error as follows:2 
(1) Miroyan contends that the "Circuit Court erred by 
failing to rule on HRB/Miroyan's counterclaims and third[ -]party 
plaintiff's claims that directly relate to [the Kai Trust's] 
foreclosure claim."  The record reflects that neither HRB nor 
Miroyan argued  below that the circuit court could not grant the 
Kai Trust's Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment unless it 
 
1  The Honorable Robert D.S. Kim presided.   
 
2  As a threshold matter, we address whether Miroyan has standing to 
bring this appeal.  Although the opening brief is signed by counsel for both 
Miroyan and Hawaiian Riverbend, LLC ( HRB), this court has previously 
determined, in its Order Denying February 11, 2020 Motion to Dismiss Appeal 
for Lack Of Appellate Jurisdiction, entered March 10, 2020, that because 
"Miroyan was not entitled to assert an appeal on behalf of [HRB]," the notice 
of appeal was not valid as to HRB and "Miroyan is the lone appellant" in this 
appeal.   
 
 A party has standing to appeal an order that directly binds them 
by name.  See NationStar Mortg. LLC v. Balocon , No. CAAP -17-0000391, 2018 WL 
3114474, at *2 ( Haw. App. June 25, 2018) (SDO).  In April 2019, the circuit 
court granted the Kai Trust's motion to certify Miroyan as John Doe Defendant 
No. 1, and ordered that Miroyan "shall be deemed to have notice of the 
institution of this action for all purposes, and shall be bound by all prior 
orders, decrees,  or judgments rendered herein[.]"  Thus, the circuit court's 
Judgment, which was entered "against all Defendants," binds Miroyan, and 
Miroyan has standing to appeal the Judgment.

 resolved all of HRB and Miroyan's counterclaims and third -party 
claims; HRB argued only that, if the Kai Trust was to prevail on 
its Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment, the counterclaims and 
cross-claims "must still survive."  This argument is therefore 
deemed to have been waived on appeal, and we decline to address 
Miroyan's first point of error.  State v. Moses , 102 Hawai ʻi 449, 
456, 77 P.3d 940, 947 (2003) (citation omitted) ("As a general 
rule, if a party does not raise an argument at trial, that 
argument will be deemed to have been waived on appeal; this rule 
applies in both criminal and civil cases.").3   
(2) Miroyan contends that the circuit court erred by 
"not allowing [Miroyan] to represent his limited liability 
company HRB, of which he was the sole member and 100% owner 
solely on the basis of not hiring licensed counsel."  Miroyan 
contends that his due process rights were violated because he 
was prevented from "voic[ing] his concerns at the June 3, [2019]4 
judicial proceeding" regarding the Motion to Compel and Motion 
for Sanctions ( June 2019 hearing ).   
 
3  We note, however, that the Judgment was "final and appealable" as 
to the decree of foreclosure despite "the fact that many matters relating to 
it remain undetermined[,]" and the circuit court continues to have 
jurisdiction over any undetermined matters col lateral or incidental to the 
Judgment and can still rule on them.  See Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 
667-51(a)(1)  (2016); Cent. Pac. Bank v. Metcalfe , No. CAAP -14-0000851, 2015 
WL 3549997, at *1 -2 (Haw. App. June 4, 2015)  (SDO). 
 
4  Miroyan's opening brief incorrectly states the date of the 
June 2019 hearing as June 3, 201 8.

 It appears that Miroyan failed to properly preserve 
this point of error.  Miroyan fired HRB's attorney at the 
June 2019 hearing.  The circuit court instructed that Miroyan 
would not be allowed to represent HRB at the hearing, but gave 
HRB twenty-one days to retain a new attorney.  It appears 
Miroyan did not present any argument as to why he should be able 
to represent HRB , and that  his only objection was to state , 
"[o]bject, did not see motions."  
But assuming arguendo  that Miroyan's second point of 
error was not waived, we further conclude that it lacks merit.  
The law in our jurisdiction is clear that "natural persons are 
not permitted to act as 'attorneys' and represent other natural 
persons in [t]heir causes[,]" and "non -attorney agents are not 
allowed to represent corporations in litigation[.]"  Oahu

(2022) (reaffirming Oahu Plumbing ), and HRS §§ 605 -14 (2016) and 
605-2 (2016).5  Miroyan is not an attorney; HRB is a corporate 
entity.  "The procedure requiring a corporation to appear 
 
5  HRS § 605 -14 provides, in pertinent part, "[i]t shall be unlawful 
for any person . . . to engage in or attempt to engage in or to offer to 
engage in the practice of law . . . except and to the extent that the person, 
firm, or association is licensed or aut horized so to do by an appropriate 
court, agency, or office or by a statute of the State or of the United 
States."   
 
HRS § 605 -2 authorizes a person to practice law "without the aid 
of legal counsel" for his or her  "own cause."   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 through an attorney in no way deprives the appellant of its 
substantive right of due process."  Oahu Plumbing , 60 Haw. at 
378, 590 P.2d at 574  (citation omitted) .  The circuit court did 
not err by not allowing Miroyan to provide legal representation 
to HRB at the June 2019 hearing.  
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the circuit 
court's Judgment.
