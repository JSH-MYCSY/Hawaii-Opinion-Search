IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
LO, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v. 
N
O, Defendant-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(FC-D NO. 16-1-1111) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Plaintiff-Appellant LO (Father
) appeals from the Order 
Granting in Part Motion for Post-Decree Relief (Order) entered by 
the Family Court of the First Circuit1 on October 3, 2019. For 
the reasons explained below, we affirm the Order. 
Father and Defendant-Appellee NO (Mother) were married 
in 2014. Their child (Child) was born in 2015. Father filed a 
complaint for divorce in 2016. A Divorce Decree was entered on 
May 20, 2019. Mother appealed. We affirmed. LO v. NO, 
No. CAAP-19-0000446, 2020 WL 589201 (Haw. App. Feb. 6, 2020) 
(mem.). The supreme court granted Mother's application for writ 
of certiorari. LO v. NO, No. SCWC-19-0000446, 2020 WL 2562020 
(Haw. May 20, 2020). That case remains pending in the supreme court. 
1 The Honorable Jessi L.K. Hall presided. On June 12, 2019, Mother filed the Motion and 
Declaration for Post-Decree Relief (Motion) at issue in this 
appeal. The Motion sought, among other relief: 
[Mother] needs [Child]'s passport to travel with the
child. [Father] has utterly refused to cooperate with this
matter and must be ordered by this Court to allow a pssport[sic] to be issued. 
The family court entered the Order on October 3, 2019. Father 
filed a notice of appeal on October 30, 2019. 
The family court entered findings of fact and 
conclusions of law on December 16, 2019. 
Father's opening brief 
does not quote any of the family court's findings of fact urged as error, nor were the findings of fact appended to the brief, as
alternatively required by Rule 28(b)(4)(C) of the Hawai# i Rules 
of Appellate Procedure. 
Accordingly, the family court's findings
of fact are binding on Father and on us. Kawamata Farms, Inc. v.
United Agri Prods., 86 Hawai# i 214, 252, 948 P.2d 1055, 1093 
(1997).  
 
 
Father raises three points of error: (1) the family 
court erred when it failed to require Mother to mediate before 
filing the Motion; (2) the family court lacked jurisdiction over 
the Motion because Mother's appeal from the Divorce Decree was 
pending; and (3) the family court abused its discretion by 
ordering Father to cooperate with Child's passport application. 
[T]he family court possesses wide discretion in making its
decisions and those decision[s] will not be set aside unlessthere is a manifest abuse of discretion. Thus, we will notdisturb the family court's decisions on appeal unless thefamily court disregarded rules or principles of law orpractice to the substantial detriment of a party litigantand its decision clearly exceeded the bounds of reason. 
Fisher v. Fisher, 111 Hawai# i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 (2006) 
(citation omitted). 
1. Father correctly contends that the Divorce Decree 
required the parties to mediate before filing any post-decree 
motions "about a major decision concerning the child[.]" The 
record on appeal does not contain any indication that Father 
raised Mother's failure to mediate with the family court. The 
2 issue is waived. Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Wailea Elua v. 
Wailea Resort Co., 100 Hawai# i 97, 107, 58 P.3d 608, 618 (2002) 
(holding that legal issues not raised before trial court are 
deemed waived on appeal). 
2. We address Father's challenge to the family 
court's jurisdiction even though the record does not indicate that Father raised the issue with the family court. Chun v. 
Emps' Ret. Sys., 73 Haw. 9, 14, 828 P.2d 260, 263 (1992) (noting that a court will consider subject matter jurisdiction even if 
the parties have not raised the issue, because a judgment entered 
without subject matter jurisdiction is invalid). 
Mother's Motion requested modification of her child 
visitation rights, enforcement of Father's child support 
obligations, and an order that Father cooperate to apply for a 
passport for Child.
2 The family court had jurisdiction over 
Mother's Motion notwithstanding the pendency of Mother's appeal 
from the Divorce Decree. See Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 
ยง 580-47;3 Hawai# i Family Court Rules (HFCR) Rule 62.4 
3. The family court's unchallenged findings of fact 
were: 
9. At the continued hearing on [Mother]'s Motion
held October 2, 2019, [Mother] sought an order that the 
2 The Divorce Decree contained no provision about Child obtaining a
passport. 
3 HRS ยง 580-47(b) (2018) provides, in relevant part: 
The [family] court shall at all times, including during the
pendency of any appeal, have the power to grant any and allorders that may be necessary to protect and provide for thesupport and maintenance of the parties and any children ofthe parties to secure justice, to compel either party toadvance reasonable amounts for the expenses of the appealincluding attorney's fees to be incurred by the other party,and to amend and revise such orders from time to time. 
4 HFCR Rule 62(a) provides, in relevant part: 
When an appeal is taken from any judgment relating to the
custody or support of a child or spousal support, the courtin its discretion may suspend, modify or grant suchjudgments during the pendency of the appeal upon such termsas it considers proper. 
3 minor child be issued a passport. [Mother] via counsel made
it clear that she was not requesting to travel with theminor child at this time. 
10. [Father] did not present any relevant nor
compelling grounds for the minor child to not have apassport. 
11. [Father] was informed that the fact of the minor
having a passport issued will not require [Father] to agreeto any travel in the future. 
12. [Mother] agreed and the Court reiterated that
the subject minor cannot leave the country without theexpress written consent of the parties or by future order ofthe Court. 
13. [Father] was concerned that if the minor child
had a passport, [Mother] would take the minor child toVietnam. 
14. [Father] was asked if he still objected if he
kept the passport in his possession. [Father] stated thathe did object[
5] and again only due to his concern that
[Mother] would take the minor child to Vietnam. 
15. [Mother] understood that just because a passport
is ordered to be issued that there was not any promise thatany court will ever allow her to take the minor to Vietnam. 
(Emphasis and footnote added.) The family court also made the
following conclusions of law, which were actually findings of 
fact:  
5. No evidence was provided to show that obtaining
a passport for the minor child would not be in the minor's
best interests. 
6. [Mother] has shown that having a passport could
be beneficial for the minor child for future use with either parent or as a form of identification for the minor child. 
The Order stated, among other things: 
Father [is] to cooperate with [Child]'s Passport
application process and the US Passport application for thechild is to be submitted within 90 days from today. Mother shall pay the costs, and Father is entitled to possess thePassport. 
We hold that the family court did not abuse its discretion by 
entering the Order. 
5 Father's contention that the family court found he "did not object
to the passport issuance" is without merit. 
4 Based upon the foregoing, the Order Granting in Part 
Motion for Post-Decree Relief entered by the Family Court of the 
First Circuit on October 3, 2019, is affirmed.
