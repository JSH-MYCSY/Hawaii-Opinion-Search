APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By:  Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and McCullen, JJ.)
 
  Defendant-Appellant Stephen Laudig (Laudig) appeals 
from the Circuit Court of the First Circuit's (1) July 8, 2019 
"Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting 
Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment Against All Defendants 
and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure" (Foreclosure NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 Order), (2) July 8, 2019 Judgment, and (3) October 1, 2019 
"Order Denying Defendant Stephen Laudig's Nonhearing Motion for 
Reconsideration of the [Foreclosure Order and Judgment]" (Order 
Denying Reconsideration).1 
On appeal, Laudig contends the circuit court erred in 
granting Plaintiff-Appellee Bank of New York's2 Motion for 
Summary Judgment Against All Defendants and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure, arguing that (1) Mhari Holtzclaw 
(Holtzclaw) was not a qualified witness, (2) Bank of New York 
failed to show delivery of the "Notice of Intent to Accelerate Indebtedness and Foreclose" (Default Notice), and (3) Bank of 
New York failed to show it possessed the note at the time the 
complaint was filed.

Upon careful review of the record and briefs submitted 
by the parties, and having given due consideration to the issues 
 
1  The Honorable James C. McWhinnie presided. 
 
2  The Bank of New York's full name in this litigation is "Bank of New 
York Mellon FKA the Bank of New York as Trustee for the Certificateholders 
CWALT, Inc., Alternative Loan Trust 2004- 28CB, Mortgage Pass- Through 
Certificates, Series 2004- 28CB." 
 
3  Laudig raises a fourth point of error, arguing that the circuit court 
erred by failing to consider the declaration of James M. Kelley.   Based on 
our decision today, we decline to address this point.   
 
We also note that, within his points of error, Laudig raises additional 
arguments that were not raised before the circuit court, which we also 
decline to address.  See Cnty. of Hawai‘ i v. UNIDEV, LLC, 129 Hawai‘ i  378, 387, 
301 P.3d 588, 597 (2013) ("It is axiomatic that where a party fails to raise 
an argument before the courts below, that argument may be deemed waived for 
purposes of appeal. "). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
3 
 raised and arguments advanced, we resolve Laudig's points of 
error as follows, and vacate and remand. 
At the outset, we emphasize that "[i]n order to prove 
entitlement to foreclose, the foreclosing party must demonstrate 
that all conditions precedent to foreclose under the note and 
mortgage are satisfied and that all steps required by statute 
have been strictly complied with."  Bank of Am., N.A. v. Reyes-
Toledo, 139 Hawai‘ i 361, 367, 390 P.3d 1248, 1254 (2017).  Thus, 
the foreclosing party must "prove the existence of an agreement, the terms of the agreement, a default by the mortgagor under the 
terms of the agreement, and giving of the cancellation notice."  
Id.  "A foreclosing plaintiff must also prove its entitlement to 
enforce the note and mortgage."  Id. 
We review the granting of summary judgment de novo.  
U.S. Bank N.A. v. Mattos, 140 Hawai‘ i 26, 30, 398 P.3d 615, 619 
(2017). 
(1) Laudig first contends that Holtzclaw was not a 
qualified witness to introduce and authenticate records that 
loan servicer New Penn Financial, LLC d/b/a Shellpoint Mortgage 
Servicing (Shellpoint), received from prior loan servicers Bank 
of America, N.A. and Resurgent Mortgage Servicing (Resurgent) 
because she failed to establish personal knowledge with respect 
to the business records at issue.  Laudig argues that the NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
4 
 Holtzclaw Declaration "is contradictory" as to whether the 
"prior servicer" is Resurgent, Bank of America, or both.  Bank 
of New York counters that, because Shellpoint acquired 
Resurgent, "the records of Resurgent should be considered those 
of Shellpoint rather than those of a prior servicer." 
Under the incorporation doctrine "[r]ecords received 
from another business and incorporated into the receiving 
business' records may in some circumstances be regarded as 
'created' by the receiving business."  Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. 
Behrendt, 142 Hawai‘ i 37, 45, 414 P.3d 89, 97 (2018) (citing 
Mattos, 140 Hawai‘ i at 32, 398 P.3d at 621).  Thus, incorporated 
records are admissible under Hawai‘ i Rules of Evidence (HRE) 
Rule 803(b)(6) "when a custodian or qualified witness testifies that the documents were incorporated and kept in the normal 
course of business, that the incorporating business typically 
relies upon the accuracy of the contents of the documents, and 
the circumstances otherwise indicate the trustworthiness of the 
document."  Id. (citing Mattos, 140 Hawai
‘i at 32, 398 P.3d at 
621; State v. Fitzwater, 122 Hawai‘ i 354, 367-68, 227 P.3d 520, 
533-34 (2010)). 
Further, "evidence that a business has incorporated
and relied on a record created by another organization speaks
directly to that record's reliability.  When accompanied by   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
5 
 testimony about other circumstances that also indicate the 
record's trustworthiness, such evidence is an acceptable 
substitute for testimony concerning a record's actual creation."
U.S. Bank Tr., N.A. as Tr. for LSF9 Master Participation Tr. v. 
Verhagen, 149 Hawai‘ i 315, 326, 489 P.3d 419, 430 (2021) 
(emphasis omitted).  
  As to Resurgent's records, although Holtzclaw's 
Declaration asserts that Resurgent's records became part of 
Shellpoint's records due to the acquisition, there was no 
testimony that Shellpoint kept Resurgent's documents in the 
normal course of business, relied on them, or otherwise 
described their trustworthiness.  See generally, Behrendt, 142 
Hawai‘i at 45, 414 P.3d at 97.  Therefore, Bank of New York 
failed to establish the admissibility of these records under HRE Rule 803(b)(6).  
  As to Bank of America's records, although Holtzclaw's declaration describing their incorporation may have otherwise 
satisfied the factors of the incorporation doctrine under 
Behrendt and Verhagen, Holtzclaw's declaration appears to 
incorrectly state that Bank of America's records were 
incorporated by Shellpoint rather than by Resurgent, despite 
indicating that Resurgent became the servicer prior to 
Shellpoint acquiring Resurgent.  Cf. Wilmington Sav. Fund Soc'y, NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 FSB v. Akehi, 144 Hawai‘ i 430, 443 P.3d 122, No. CAAP-18-0000477,
2019 WL 2559486 at *7 (App. June 21, 2019) (SDO) ("In order for 
Pope to establish the admissibility of a document attached to 
her declaration, Pope must, at a minimum, accurately describe
 
the contents of the document, particularly with the respect to 
which entity is responsible for having provided the requisite 
notice . . .") (emphases added).  Holtzclaw's declaration must 
be accurate in its factual description of which entity actually 
incorporated Bank of America's documents to establish the 
admissibility of these records under HRE Rule 803(b)(6).  
(2) Laudig next contends that Bank of New York failed 
to show that a notice of default was given to him.
 
To establish that notice was given to Laudig, Bank of 
New York provided (1) a copy of two Default Notices addressed to Laudig and dated July 11, 2013, and (2) Holtzclaw's declaration 
stating that "[w]ritten notice ('Notice') was given to Borrower 
of the default and of mortgagee's intention to accelerate the 
loan if the default was not cured." 
  The Default Notices provided appear to be records from 
Resurgent as they were on Resurgent letterhead, required payment to be sent to Resurgent, and were signed by a Resurgent 
representative.  But, as discussed above, Bank of New York 
failed to establish the admissibility of Resurgent's records 
under HRE Rule 803(b)(6).  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 (3) Finally, Laudig contends that Bank of New York 
failed to prove it possessed the note when the complaint was 
filed. 
When a note is indorsed in blank, it becomes payable 
to 
the bearer and may be negotiated by transfer or possession 
alone.  See Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai‘i at 370, 390 P.3d at 1257.  
Thus, when a lender forecloses on a mortgage secured by a note indorsed in blank, the lender must establish, inter alia, that 
it held the original indorsed note at the time it filed the 
complaint.  139 
Hawai‘i at 368, 390 P.3d at 1255. 
To prove that it was in possession of the 
note at the 
time the complaint was filed, Bank of New York provided the 
following:  (1) the note indorsed in blank; (2) the February 25, 
2015 Bailee Letter; (3) Holtzclaw's declaration; and (4) Gina 
Santellan's (Santellan) declaration. 
The Bailee Letter, establishing that the note was 
received by Bank of New York's representative, was dated February 25, 2015.  Santellan's declaration, stating that the 
Note "is currently in our custody as custodian for Plaintiff and 
Plaintiff's counsel[,]" was dated December 31, 2018.  With the 
Bailee Letter and Santellan's declaration, Bank of New York 
established that it received the note on February 25, 2015 and 
was still in possession of the note on December 31, 2018, which NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

/s/ Clyde J. Wadsworth Associate Judge 
 
/s/ Sonja M.P. McCullen Associate Judge
 would show that it possessed the note when the complaint was 
filed on August 4, 2015.   
The burden then shifted to Laudig to set "forth 
specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial."  
Kondaur Cap
. Corp. v. Matsuyoshi, 136 Hawai‘i 227, 240-41, 361 
P.3d 454, 467-68 (2015) (cleaned up).  Laudig, however, 
presented no evidence showing that there was a genuine issue as 
to whether Bank of New York continuously held the note between 
February 25, 2015 and December 31, 2018. 
In conclusion, because Bank of New York failed to 
establish that Resurgent's and Bank of America's records were 
admissible, the circuit court erred in granting Bank of New 
York's motion for summary judgment.  We vacate the circuit court's Foreclosure Order, Judgment, and Order Denying 
Reconsideration, and remand this case for further proceedings 
consistent with this order.
