Beach Lots ).1 They sued the State of Hawai #i. They sought a 
declaration that the State, by enacting 2003 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 
73, took existing and future accreted land2 without paying just 
compensation. The circuit court agreed, but let the State take 
an interlocutory appeal. We held that "Act 73 effectuated a permanent taking of" ownership rights in accreted land existing and unregistered as of Act 73's effective date. Maunalua Bay

appeal, and moot. We affirm the Final Judgment. 
I. BACKGROUND4 
The Estate of Bernice Pauahi Bishop ( Bishop Estate ) 
owned the land in the Portlock area of east O#ahu. In the 1930s 
Bishop Estate subdivided the land into Home Lots . It kept the 
fee interest and leased the Home Lots. Many of the Home Lots were near the beach, but Bishop Estate never leased the Beach Lots — long, narrow strips of beach between the Home Lots and the ocean. 
Bishop Estate never restricted the Beach Lots for 
exclusive use by lessees of Home Lots bordering the Beach Lots. In the 1990s Bishop Estate sold the fee interests in the Home Lots to their lessees, but continued to own the Beach Lots. 
4 Some of the background comes from the parties' stipulated facts
and from the circuit court's unchallenged findings of fact. See Okada 
Trucking Co. v. Bd. of Water Supply , 97 Hawaii# 450, 459, 40 P.3d 73, 82
(2002) (noting that unchallenged factual findings are deemed to be binding on
appeal). 
3 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Bishop Estate never restricted the Beach Lots for exclusive use 
of owners of Home Lots bordering the Beach Lots. 
Before May 20, 2003, Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) 
§ 171-2 provided: 
Definition of public lands . "Public lands" means all lands 
or interest therein in the State classed as government or
crown lands previous to August 15, 1895, or acquired orreserved by the government upon or subsequent to that dateby purchase, exchange, escheat, or the exercise of the rightof eminent domain, or in any other manner; includingsubmerged lands, and lands beneath tidal waters which aresuitable for reclamation, together with reclaimed landswhich have been given the status of public lands under thischapter, [subject to exceptions not at issue in this case.] 
HRS § 171-2 (Supp. 2002). 
Act 73 amended HRS § 171-2 by adding "accreted lands 
not otherwise awarded" to the definition of "public lands." 2003 
Haw. Sess. Laws Act 73, § 2 at 128. It took effect on May 20, 2003. Id., § 8 at 130. It effectively made any land accreted to 
the Beach Lots after May 20, 2003, public land not owned by Bishop Estate.
5 
On May 6, 2005, Bishop Estate sold the Beach Lots to 
Beach Lot Owners for $3,000. Each Beach Lot owner paid $1,000 for its lot. The deeds had a "restriction limiting the use of the parcels for non-residential use only." They also had restrictive covenants running with the land. The covenants require that the Beach Lots be "used by the public for access, customary beach activities and related recreational and community purposes . . . in perpetuity[.]" 
5 Act 73 also restricted the ability of private landowners to
register accreted land in land court, 2003 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 73, § 4 at 129,
and to quiet title to accreted land, id. , § 5 at 129.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Two weeks after buying the Beach Lots, Beach Lot Owners 
sued the State for inverse condemnation. They sought a 
declaration that Act 73 took the Accreted Land, an injunction against enforcement of Act 73 without payment of just compensation, and payment of just compensation. The circuit court certified a plaintiff class "consisting of all non-governmental owners of oceanfront real property in the State of Hawai#i on and/or after May 19, 2003." 
The circuit court granted Beach Lot Owners' motion for 
partial summary judgment, declaring that Act 73 "effected an uncompensated taking of, and injury to, [Beach Lot Owners'] accreted land[.]"
6 Maunalua Bay , 122 Hawai #i at 36, 222 P.3d 
at 443. The State took an interlocutory appeal. We held that 
Act 73 "effectuated a permanent taking of" accretions existing and unregistered as of Act 73's effective date. Id. at 57, 222 
P.3d at 464. 
But we also held that Beach Lot Owners "and the 
class they represented had no vested property rights to future accretions to their oceanfront land and, therefore, Act 73 did not effect an uncompensated taking of future accretions[.]" Id. 
We remanded for the circuit court to decide whether Beach Lot Owners owned land that had accreted before Act 73's effective date and, if so, to determine just compensation for the taking. Id. 
On remand, Beach Lot Owners moved to certify a damages 
class of "[a]ll private owners of oceanfront property in the

5 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
State of Hawai #i who, as of May 19, 2003, owned accreted land[.]" 
The circuit court denied class certification. The parties 
stipulated that Beach Lot Owners owned land that accreted before Act 73 took effect, and that "[j]ust compensation, if any, shall be based on the fair rental value of the accreted land as of [Act 73's effective date], but taking into account restrictions on [Beach Lot Owners'] use of the property, if appropriate." 
The circuit court held a bench trial to determine just 
compensation. It found that just compensation was $0. 
It 
granted the State's motion for costs, denied Beach Lot Owners' motion for attorneys fees, and entered the Final Judgment for the State and against Beach Lot Owners.
7 Beach Lot Owners appealed.8 
Beach Lot Owners contend that the circuit court erred 
by: (1) concluding that no permanent taking occurred; (2) not 
awarding damages; (3) not awarding nominal damages; (4) denying 
their motion for attorneys fees; (5) denying their motion to 
certify a damages class; and (6) determining that the State was 
the prevailing party. 
7 The Honorable James C. McWhinnie entered the orders on costs and 
attorneys fees and the Final Judgment. 
8 The State cross-appealed but the cross-appeal is moot because we
affirm the Final Judgment. See Leone v. County of Maui , 141 Hawai#i 68, 89,
404 P.3d 1257, 1278 (2017) (concluding that cross-appeal was moot because
circuit court's judgment was affirmed).

II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A. Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law 
We review findings of fact under the clearly erroneous 
standard. Est. of Klink ex rel. Klink v. State , 113 Hawai #i 332, 
351, 152 P.3d 504, 523 (2007). 
A finding of fact is clearly 
erroneous when the record lacks substantial evidence to support 
the finding or when, despite substantial evidence to support the finding, we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. Id. "Substantial evidence" is "credible 
evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion." Id. (citations omitted). 
We review conclusions of law de novo under the 
right/wrong standard. Klink, 113 Hawai#i at 351, 152 P.3d at 
523. But a conclusion of law presenting mixed questions of fact and law is reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard because the court's conclusion depends on the facts and circumstances of the individual case. Id.  A conclusion of law supported by the trial court's findings of fact and applying the correct rule of law will not be overturned. Id.  
B. Attorneys Fees Under the Private Attorney
General Doctrine 
We review a denial of attorneys fees under the private 
attorney general doctrine de novo under the right/wrong standard.

C. Class Certification 
We review the denial of class certification for abuse 
of discretion. Gurrobat v. HTH Corp. , 133 Hawai #i 1, 14, 323 
P.3d 792, 805 (2014).

We review a trial court's determination of who is the 
prevailing party de novo under the right/wrong standard. Molinar 
v. Schweizer
, 95 Hawai #i 331, 334–35, 22 P.3d 978, 981–82 (2001). 
III. DISCUSSION 
A. The circuit court did not err by concluding,
given Act 56 (2012), that Act 73 effected atemporary taking. 
Beach Lot Owners argue that the circuit court "erred in 
disregarding the law of the case . . . and concluding that there 
was no taking" of the Accreted Land. The argument fails for two 
reasons. 
First, the circuit court did not conclude there was no 
taking; had it done so, it would not have had to try the claim for just compensation. Beach Lot Owners cite to the circuit court's conclusions that Act 73 did not effect a regulatory taking under various tests commonly called Loretto, Lucas, and Penn Central. See Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc., 544 U.S. 528, 538–39, 125 S. Ct. 2074, 161 L. Ed. 2d 876 (2005); see also Leone v. County of Maui, 141 
Hawai#i 68, 81, 404 P.3d 1257, 1270 (2017) 
(summarizing law on regulatory takings). But the circuit court also concluded: 
8 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
11. In addition to reaffirming its conclusion that
Act 73 effected a temporary taking of [Beach Lot Owners']
accreted lands , this Court further concludes that, by
repealing portions of Act 73, Act 56 ended the taking of
accreted lands, effective April 23, 2012. In other words,the State effected a temporary taking  of [Beach Lot Owners']
accreted lands from May 20, 2003 to April 23, 2012. 
(Emphasis added.) The conclusion was not wrong. And it follows 
Beach Lot Owners' argument (in its opening brief) that Act 56 "merely limited the taking to a period of nine years." 
Second, the circuit court did not violate the law of 
the case. Under the law of the case doctrine, "a determination of a question of law made by an appellate court in the course of an action becomes the law of the case and may not be disputed by a reopening of the question at a later stage of the litigation." Hussey v. Say, 139 Hawai #i 181, 185, 384 P.3d 1282, 1286 (2016) 
(citation omitted). 
On December 30, 2009, we held that Act 73 
"effectuated a permanent  taking of" accretions existing and 
unregistered as of Act 73's effective date. Maunalua Bay, 122 Hawai#i at 57, 222 P.3d at 464 (emphasis added). Three years 
later, Act 56 of the 2012 legislature changed the law by 
terminating the taking effectuated by Act 73. Act 56 further amended the definition of "public lands" in HRS § 171-2. 2012 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 56, § 1 at 122. Under Act 56, only land that accreted after the effective date of Act 76 were public lands. Id.  Act 56 took effect on April 23, 2012. Id. § 5 at 123. Act 56 thus limited the effect Act 73 had on Beach Lot Owners to the period from May 20, 2003 (the effective date of Act 73) to April 23, 2012.

[A] governmental body may acquiesce in a judicial
declaration that one of its ordinances has effected an unconstitutional taking of property; the landowner has noright under the Just Compensation Clause [of the FifthAmendment to the United States Constitution] to insist thata "temporary" taking be deemed a permanent taking. 
First Eng. Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v. Los Angeles 
County, 482 U.S. 304, 317, 107 S. Ct. 2378, 96 L. Ed. 2d 250 
(1987). 
Under some circumstances, a change in controlling law 
could support relief under Hawai#i Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP) Rule 60(b)(6). See
 Gonzalez v. Crosby , 545 U.S. 524, 531, 
125 S. Ct. 2641, 162 L. Ed 2d 480 (2005) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6)). Instead, Beach Lot Owners stipulated that the circuit court would decide "whether Act 73 effected and Act 56 ended a temporary  taking of any accreted lands from May 19, 2003, to 
April 23, 2012 (or any part of that time) and if so the amount of just compensation, if any, that is due to [Beach Lot Owners] for the taking." (Emphasis added.) The law of the case doctrine did not prevent the circuit court from considering the change in the controlling law, particularly given Beach Lot Owners' stipulation. 
B. The circuit court's finding that just
compensation to Beach Lot Owners was $0 wasnot clearly erroneous. 
Beach Lot Owners argue that "depriving [them] of ocean-
front property in Maunalua Bay for 9 years cannot possibly be 
valued at $0." The parties stipulated that "[j]ust compensation, if any, shall be based on the fair rental value of the accreted land as of May 19, 2003, but taking into account restrictions on 
10 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
plaintiffs' use of the property, if appropriate." The 
restrictions included limiting the Beach Lots to non-residential use and requiring that they be open to the public for access, customary beach activities, and related recreational and community purposes, in perpetuity. 
Beach Lot Owners argue that their "[o]wnership of the 
[Beach Lots] was expected to enhance the value of the adjoining [Home Lots] and protect the solitude, peace, and quiet the owners enjoyed. The purchase was made to protect the investments made in their existing lots." (Citations to the record omitted.) Beach Lot Owners do not own any Home Lots. Beach Lot Owners conflate their entitlement to just compensation with the interests of owners of the Home Lots, who are not parties to this case. 
Beach Lot Owners' evidence of fair rental value was 
based on the testimony of Stephany Sofos. The circuit court "did 
not find Ms. Sofos to be a credible witness" and gave "no weight to her testimony." "It is well-settled that an appellate court will not pass upon issues dependent upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight of evidence; this is the province of the trier of fact." Fisher v. Fisher
, 111 Hawai#i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 
355, 360 (2006) (citation omitted). 
11 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The circuit court instead credited the testimony of 
Craig Leong, a licensed real estate appraiser who holds the MAI 
designation.9 The circuit court found: 
108. Mr. Leong based his conclusion on highest-and-
best use on, among other things, the irregular shapes and
narrow widths of the parcels; limited access; conservation-district regulations; the restrictive covenants in the KSdeeds to plaintiffs; the State's non-interference withplaintiffs use; the lack of any history of financial gainfrom the makai land, and the fact that [Bishop Estate] soldthe three beach reserve lots for $1,000 each. The Court finds that Mr. Leong's analysis is credible. 
109. The Court agrees with Mr. Leong's conclusion:
"Given the highly irregular, and narrow propertycharacteristics of the accreted land, and afterconsideration of the restricted street access to the subjectproperty, and perhaps, more importantly, as both governmentand private land use regulations and covenants restrict thelegally permissible use of the accreted land area to publicaccess, customary beach activities, and related recreationaland community purposes, the appraiser concludes that noknown market buyer exists for the subject accreted land." 
110. Mr. Leong concludes that there was a $0 market
rent attributable to the land with a retrospective date of2003. 
111. The Court finds Mr. Leong's ultimate conclusion
of value to be credible, logical, and well founded. The Court finds that the fair market rent as of May 2003 was $0. 
(Citations to the record omitted.) 
Beach Lot Owners' statement of the points of error 
challenges these findings, but their opening brief presents no 
argument about why they were clearly erroneous. See Hawai#i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(7) ("Points not argued may be deemed waived."). At any rate, the findings are supported

by substantial evidence in the record, and were not clearly 
erroneous. 
The circuit court concluded: 
69. For all of the reasons set forth in the findings
of fact, including the credible testimony of Mr. Leong, the
Court finds that the fair market rent for the [AccretedLand] on May 19, 2003 was $0. 
This conclusion of law was actually a finding of fact.10 It was 
supported by substantial evidence in the record, and was not 
clearly erroneous. 
C. Beach Lot Owners were not entitled to nominal 
damages. 
Beach Lot Owners argue that "the lower court should 
have awarded $1 nominal damages to each Appellant." "[N]ominal 
damages are a small and trivial sum awarded for a technical injury due to a violation of some legal right and as a consequence of which some damages must be awarded to determine the right." Kanahele v. Han , 125 Hawai #i 446, 457–58, 263 P.3d

nominal damages. 
D. Beach Lot Owners were not entitled to 
attorneys fees under the private attorneygeneral doctrine. 
Beach Lot Owners sought attorneys fees under the 
equitable doctrine of private attorney general. The doctrine is 
an exception to the "American Rule" that each party must pay their own litigation expenses. Pub. Access Trails Haw.
, 153 
Hawai#i at 22, 526 P.3d at 547. 
(1) The claim is barred by sovereign immunity under 
the circumstances of this case.  The State argues that sovereign 
immunity bars an award of attorneys fees. 
The only claim on 
which Beach Lot Owners prevailed was for a declaration that Act 73 was an uncompensated taking of unregistered land that had accreted between the effective dates of Act 73 (May 20, 2003) and Act 56 (April 23, 2012). When a party seeks declaratory relief against the State, 
the ability to sue the state does not stem from a waiver of
sovereign immunity, but from the fact that sovereignimmunity does not bar the suit in the first place.Therefore, no clear statutory waiver that could be extended
to attorney's fees is present when the underlying claim is
for declaratory and/or injunctive relief .

Beach Lot Owners cite Sierra Club , but attorneys fees 
were awarded in that case because Sierra Club's claim was brought under HRS § 343-7, which waived the State's sovereign immunity against suits over environmental assessments and environmental impact statements. Id. at 228, 202 P.3d at 1273. Beach Lot 
Owners did not seek relief under HRS § 343-7.

which states: "Private property shall not be taken or damaged for public use without just compensation." A claim under Haw. Const. art. I, § 20 seeks compensation for something the government has

The circuit court found that just compensation for 
Act 73's temporary taking of the Accreted Land was $0. The only 
claim on which Beach Lot Owners prevailed (partially) was one for declaratory relief. But their claim for attorneys fees against the State for obtaining declaratory relief is barred by sovereign immunity. Nelson, 130 Hawai #i at 170, 307 P.3d at 150. 
(2) Beach Lot Owners did not satisfy the legal test. 
Even if sovereign immunity had not barred Beach Lot Owners' claim for attorneys fees, they did not satisfy the legal test. 
Courts 
consider three factors to determine whether the private attorney general doctrine applies: 
(1) the strength or societal importance of the public
policy vindicated by the litigation, 
(2) the necessity for private enforcement and themagnitude of the resultant burden on the plaintiff,and 
(3) the number of people standing to benefit from thedecision.

her to Princess Bernice Pauahi P ākī Bishop (great-granddaughter

twentieth century.14 Beach Lot Owners and the State disagreed 
about the location of the shoreline boundary in the land commission award, and whether or when any part of the Beach Lots was awarded to Kam āmalu. The State stipulated on remand that 
Beach Lot Owners owned the Beach Lots and the Accreted Land. That stipulation binds us. But under Hawai #i common law the

at 453. Ordinarily, an owner of beachfront property would not own land makai (seaward) of the debris or vegetation line (whichever is further mauka), no matter what the deed's property description states. If land accretes to property makai of that line, the beachfront property owner would not own the accreted land. Of the class certification, we noted: 
While certification of a class for purposes of determining
generically whether Act 73 effectuated a taking of littoralowners' future accretions might have been appropriate, wehave questions about whether the class certification wasproper for determining whether Act 73 effectuated a takingof those accretions existing as of the effective date ofAct 73, since each littoral owner's factual situationregarding existing accretions would be different and notconducive to class adjudication. 
Id. at 55-56, 222 P.3d at 462-63. 
At any rate, Beach Lot Owners vindicated private, not 
public, interests — those of people (if any) who owned property 
makai of the highest reach of the highest wash of the waves, to which unregistered land accreted between May 20, 2003 and April 23, 2012. The class comprises far less than "all of the citizens of the state, present and future[.]" The public interest calls for the beaches of Hawai #i to be available for use by all 
citizens of the state, present and future, not just to a few private beach owners. See Application of Ashford , 50 Haw. 314, 
315, 440 P.2d 76, 77 (1968) (holding that the seaward boundary of private property "is along the upper reaches of the wash of waves, usually evidenced by the edge of vegetation or by the line 
18 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of debris left by the wash of waves"); County of Hawaii v. 
Sotomura , 55 Haw. 176, 181–82, 517 P.2d 57, 61–62 (1973) (noting 
that "[t]he Ashford  decision was a judicial recognition of long-
standing public use of Hawaii's beaches to an easily recognizable boundary that has ripened into a customary right. Public policy, as interpreted by this court, favors extending to public use and ownership as much of Hawaii's shoreline as is reasonably possible." (citation omitted)). The first factor for application of the private attorney general doctrine was not satisfied. 
(b) The second factor involves "the necessity for 
private enforcement and the magnitude of the resultant burden on the plaintiff[.]" Pub. Access Trails Haw.
, 153 Hawai#i at 22, 
526 P.3d at 547. The supreme court has explained: 
In the complex society in which we live it frequently occurs
that citizens in great numbers and across a broad spectrumhave interests in common. These, while of enormoussignificance to the society as a whole, do not involve thefortunes of a single individual to the extent necessary toencourage their private vindication in the courts. 
In re Water Use Permit Applications, 96 Hawai#i at 30, 25 P.3d 
at 805 (citation omitted). Beach Lot Owners argue that "the 
costs of litigating for more than a dozen years against the vast resources of the State of Hawai #i dwarfs the potential recovery 
of any individual non-governmental beachfront property owner." But Beach Lot Owners sought compensation of more than $6 million — $695,467.77 for the year beginning May 19, 2003 (based on Sofos' opinion of fair rental value), going up two percent each year for eight years, plus interest. This obviously is not a 
19 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
case where no single person would have an incentive to sue the 
State for compensation under Act 73. The second factor was not satisfied. 
(c) The third factor is "the number of people standing 
to benefit from the decision." Pub. Access Trails Haw. , 153 
Hawai#i at 22, 526 P.3d at 547. The number of people who would 
actually qualify as members of the plaintiff declaratory class is not shown, or even approximated, in the record. We question 
whether such a plaintiff class could legally exist, in light of Ashford and Sotomura . See Maunalua Bay , 122 Hawai #i at 46, 222 
P.3d at 453. Beach Lot Owners' declaratory judgment did not 
benefit "all of the citizens of the state, present and future[.]" In re Water Use Permit Applications , 96 
Hawai#i at 31, 25 P.3d 
at 806. The third factor was not satisfied. 
E. The circuit court did not abuse its 
discretion by denying certification of adamages class. 
Beach Lot Owners sought certification of a damages 
class under HRCP Rule 23(b)(2), (3). 
The rule provides: 
(b) Class actions maintainable . An action may be
maintained as a class action if the prerequisites ofsubdivision (a) are satisfied, and in addition: 
. . . . 
(2) the party opposing the class has acted or
refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class,
thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief  or 
corresponding declaratory relief  with respect to the class
as a whole; or 
(3) the court finds that the questions of law or
fact common to the members of the class predominate over anyquestions affecting only individual members, and that aclass action is superior to other available methods for thefair and efficient adjudication of the controversy. The 
20 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
matters pertinent to the findings include: (A) the interest
of members of the class in individually controlling theprosecution or defense of separate actions; (B) the extentand nature of any litigation concerning the controversyalready commenced by or against members of the class;(C) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating thelitigation of the claims in the particular forum; (D) thedifficulties likely to be encountered in the management of aclass action. 
(Emphasis added.) 
Beach Lot Owners sought to certify a damages class 
consisting of: 
All private owners of oceanfront property in the State of
Hawai#i who, as of May 19, 2003 , owned accreted land that
had not previously been recorded or registered and that wasnot, on that date, the subject of a then-pendingregistration or quiet title proceeding. 
(Emphasis added.) Beach Lot Owners acquired the Beach Lots on 
May 6, 2005. They were not members of the class they sought to certify. For this reason alone, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying class certification. 
A prerequisite under HRCP Rule 23(b)(2) "is that final 
injunctive or declaratory relief must be requested against the party opposing the class." 7AA Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1775 (3d. ed. updated Apr. 2023). A claim for money damages does not qualify for class certification under HRCP Rule 23(b)(2). Id.  Nor does a claim for just compensation, which is not a claim for injunctive or declaratory relief. 
Members of an HRCP Rule 23(b)(3) class must be notified 
of their option to be excluded from the class. HRCP Rule 23(c)(2). The circuit court ruled: 
21 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Second, Rule 23(b)(3), unlike Rule 23(b)(2), requires
notice to the class members and an opportunity to opt out.
Thus, the members of a Rule 23(b)(3) class must beascertainable. The proposed class here is not readilyascertainable. [Beach Lot Owners'] proposal to use tax mapdata and recorded documents with the Land Court and Bureau of Conveyances will be difficult to access and will notaccount for resolutions of disputes in ownership. Marcus v. BMW of North America, LLC, 687 F.3d 583, 591 (3rd Cir. 2012)("If class members are impossible to identify withoutextensive and individualized fact-finding or 'mini-trials,'then a class action is inappropriate."). 
Third, land is unique and there will be individualized
issues as to the claim for compensation and the right of theState to raise individual challenges and defenses to theclaims. [Beach Lot Owners] proposal to determine damagesbased on regional groupings does not take into considerationvariations in individual properties. 
Fourth, [Beach Lot Owners] presented a method to
determine the area of accreted land on the islands of [Kaua#i], [O #ahu
 ] and Maui, but there is no method presented
to determine the area of accreted land on the islands of Hawai#i, [Moloka #i], [Lāna#i], and [Ni #ihau]. The proposed
class is for all private owners of oceanfront property inthe State of Hawai #i, but the studies suggested by the
[Beach Lot Owners] to be used to determine the accreted landdo not include the entire state. 
Fifth, Dr. Charles Fletcher, the lead author of the
shoreline change study that [Beach Lot Owners] propose touse to determine the area of accreted land, stated in hisdeclaration that the material is not suitable for the use proposed by [Beach Lot Owners]. 
Under these circumstances, we cannot say the circuit 
court abused its discretion by denying certification of a damages 
class. 
F. The circuit court's conclusion that the State 
was the prevailing party is not material tothe issues presented by this appeal. 
The circuit court ruled that the State was the 
prevailing party in the action below. The ruling let the State 
move for costs under HRCP Rule 54(d)(1). But the State's motion for costs was also based on the State having served an HRCP Rule 68 offer of settlement for $5,000, to which Beach Lot Owners 
22 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
did not respond. Beach Lot Owners recovered no compensation. 
Under HRCP Rule 68, Beach Lot Owners "must pay the costs incurred after the making of the offer" of settlement. The State was entitled to costs under HRCP Rule 68 whether or not it was the prevailing party. Beach Lot Owners make no other argument about why the circuit court's ruling that the State was the prevailing party is material to this appeal. We need not decide the issue. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
For these reasons, we hold: (1) the law of the case 
doctrine did not prevent the circuit court from considering a change in the controlling legislation enacted after we decided Maunalua Bay ; (2) the circuit court's finding that just 
compensation was $0 was not clearly erroneous; (3) Beach Lot 
Owners were not entitled to nominal damages; (4) Beach Lot Owners 
were not entitled to attorneys fees; (5) the circuit court did 
not abuse its discretion by denying certification of a damages class; and (6) the circuit court's determination that the State 
was the prevailing party is moot. We affirm the circuit court's Final Judgment entered on October 2, 2019.
