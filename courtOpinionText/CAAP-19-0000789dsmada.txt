NO. CAAP-19-0000789
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAII, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
LUKE J. WARNER, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(1PC121001161)
ORDER
DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
AND DISMISSING ALL PENDING MOTIONS AS MOOT
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.)
Upon review of this appeal filed by Defendant-Appellant
Luke J. Warner (Warner), self-represented, from the Honorable
Karen S.S. Ahn's June 17, 2016 judgment of conviction in circuit
court criminal case number 1PC121001161, it appears that we lack
appellate jurisdiction because Warner's notice of appeal in CAAP-
19-0000789, which he apparently tendered to prison officials for
mailing no earlier than September 16, 2019, is untimely under
Rule 4(b)(1) of the Hawai#i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP)
by more than three years.  
Warner pleaded guilty to the following fourteen counts
in circuit court criminal case number 1PC121001161:
(1)attempted theft in the second degree in violation
of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 708-831 (Supp.
2012) and HRS § 705-500 (1993);NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(2)attempted theft in the second degree in violation
of HRS § 708-831 (Supp. 2012) and HRS § 705-500
(1993);
(3)methamphetamine trafficking in the second degree
in violation of HRS § 712-1240.8 (Supp. 2012);
(4)attempted theft in the second degree in violation
of HRS § 708-831 (Supp. 2012) and HRS § 705-500
(1993);
(5)attempted theft in the second degree in violation
of HRS § 708-831 (Supp. 2012) and HRS § 705-500
(1993);
(6)methamphetamine trafficking in the second degree
in violation of HRS § 712-1240.8 (Supp. 2012);
(7)attempted theft in the first degree in violation
of HRS § 708-830.5 (Supp. 2012) and HRS § 705-500
(1993);
(8)attempted ownership or possession of any prohibit
firearm or ammunition by a person convicted of
certain crimes in violation of HRS § 134-7(b)
(2011) and HRS § 705-500 (1993);
(9)attempted keeping a pistol or revolver in an
illegal place in violation of HRS § 134-25 (2011)
and HRS § 705-500 (1993);
(10)methamphetamine trafficking in the second degree
in violation of HRS § 712-1240.8 (Supp. 2012);
(11)promoting a harmful drug in the third degree in
violation of HRS § 712-1246 (1993);
(12)promoting a dangerous drug in the third degree in
violation of HRS § 712-1243 (Supp. 2012);
(13)unlawful use of drug paraphernalia in violation of
HRS § 329-43.5 (2010); and
(14)attempted theft in the third degree in violation
of HRS § 708-832 (Supp. 2012) and HRS § 705-500
(1993).
Consequently, the circuit court entered a June 17, 2016 judgment
of conviction and sentence against Warner, which was immediately
appealable pursuant to HRS § 641-11 (2016).  HRAP Rule 4(b)(1)
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
requires that, "[i]n a criminal case, the notice of appeal shall
be filed within 30 days after entry of the judgment or order
appealed from."  The issue whether an appellant "compli[ed] with
the requirement of the timely filing of a notice of appeal, as
set forth in HRAP Rule 4(b)(1), is jurisdictional."  State v.
Bohannon, 102 Hawai#i 228, 234, 74 P.3d 980, 986 (2003)
(citations, internal quotation marks, and original brackets
omitted).  Because Warner is currently a self-represented
prisoner in this appeal, we utilize Warner's date of signature in
his notice of appeal, September 16, 2019, as the earliest
possible date on which Warner might have tendered his notice of
appeal to prison officials for mailing.  Cf. Setala v. J.C.
Penney Company, 97 Hawai #i 484, 485, 40 P.3d 886, 887 (2002)
(deeming the effective date of a pro se prisoner's notice of
appeal to be the day on which he tendered it to prison
officials).  Even assuming that the effective date of Warner's
notice of appeal is September 16, 2019, Warner's notice of appeal
is untimely under HRAP Rule 4(b)(1) by more than three years.  
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED as follows:
1.Appellate court case number CAAP-19-0000789 is
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
2.All motions in appellate court case number CAAP-
19-0000789 are dismissed as moot.
3.This order is without prejudice to Warner filing a
petition pursuant to Rule 40 of the Hawai#i Rules of Penal
Procedure in the circuit court.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai#i, March 16, 2020.
