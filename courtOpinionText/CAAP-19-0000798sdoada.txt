Plaintiff-Appellant Robert G. 
Straub appeals from: (1) the "Order

Judgment Against Robert G [sic] Straub" entered by the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit on November 5, 2019; and (2) the 
"Amended Judgment Against Robert G [sic] Straub" entered on 
February 24, 2020.  For the reasons explained below, we affirm.

1 The Honorable Peter T. Cahill presided.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On February 20, 2019, Plaintiff/Counterclaim Defendant-
Appellee Papaku LLC filed a complaint in the District Court of 
the Second Circuit, Wailuku Division, against Straub and 
Defendant/Cross-Defendant Lottielois Kapono.  Attached to the 
complaint were copies of: (1) a "Standard Lease" dated June 2, 
2017, between Papaku and Straub, doing business as Ultra Hawaii 
Maui Embroidery and Trophies; and (2) an "Assignment and 
Assumption of Lease, Consent, and Amendment of Lease" between 
Papaku, Straub, and Kapono. 
Papaku's complaint alleged that Straub and Kapono were 
in default of the Lease and the Assignment and owed $32,078.18 for unpaid rent and late charges. The Assignment, which had an effective date of November 1, 2017, stated that Straub agreed "to remain as personal guarantor on this lease for (1) one year." 
Straub answered the complaint, counterclaimed against 
Papaku, cross-claimed against Kapono, and asserted a third-party 
2complaint against the County of Maui and Teena Rasmussen. 
Straub also demanded a jury trial. The County and Rasmussen 
answered the third-party complaint but asserted no claim against Straub. 
Kapono failed to answer the complaint; her default was 
entered. 
The district court ordered that Straub deposit $41,814 
into the District Court Rental Trust Fund by March 13, 2019, or the district court would issue a writ of possession and judgment for possession of the leased premises. It does not appear that a deposit was made. On March 20, 2019, the district court issued a Judgment for Possession and a Writ of Possession in favor of 
2 Straub's third-party complaint alleged that he filed charges of
discrimination with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and
the Hawai #i Civil Rights Commission after being wrongfully terminated from
employment by the County and Rasmussen. 
After he filed the charges, the
County and Rasmussen allegedly retaliated by developing "policies to prohibitStraub's business, Ultra Hawaii, from doing business with most departments ofthe County, causing the business to experience substantial declines inrevenue." As a result, Straub was allegedly unable to pay rent to Papaku,forced to sell Ultra Hawaii to Kapono "at a substantial discount[,]" andforced to guarantee the Assignment.

Papaku and against Straub and Kapono. No appeal was taken. On 
March 22, 2019, the remainder of the case was transferred to circuit court because of Straub's demand for jury trial. 
In circuit court, Papaku and Straub each filed a motion 
for summary judgment. The record on appeal does not contain a transcript of the hearing on the cross-motions. On November 5, 2019, the circuit court entered the Order, which granted Papaku's motion and denied Straub's motion; ordered that judgment be entered in favor of Papaku and against Straub for $72,886.09;
3 
and stated: "there being no just reason for delay, that the Court expressly directs that Judgment is hereby entered pursuant to Rule 54 and Rule 58 of the Hawaii [sic] Rules of Civil Procedure. This is a Final Judgment resolving all claims and issues between [Papaku] and [Straub]." 
Straub's notice of appeal was filed on November 13, 
2019. The circuit court entered the Judgment on January 29, 2020.
4 The circuit court entered the Amended Judgment on 
February 24, 2020.5 
Straub's sole point of error contends that the circuit 
court erred by granting Papaku's motion for summary judgment because there existed a genuine issue of material fact. An appellate court reviews a trial court's grant or denial of summary judgment de novo. Joy A. McElroy, M.D., Inc. v. Maryl 
Grp., Inc., 107 Hawai# i 423, 429, 114 P.3d 929, 935 (App. 2005). 
[S]ummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions onfile, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there 
3 Straub did not controvert Papaku's evidence of the amount of the
debt owed under the Lease and the Assignment. 
4 A notice of appeal filed after announcement of a decision but
before entry of a written judgment or order is deemed filed immediately afterthe time the judgment or order becomes final for the purpose of appeal. SeeRule 4(a)(2) of the Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure. 
5 On June 12, 2020, we temporarily remanded this case to the circuit
court to supplement the record with the Amended Judgment, pursuant to Life ofthe Land v. Ariyoshi, 57 Haw. 249, 252, 553 P.2d 464, 466 (1976) and State v.Joshua, 141 Hawai #i 91, 93, 405 P.3d 527, 529 (2017).

is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the
moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. A fact is material if proof of that fact would have the effectof establishing or refuting one of the essential elements ofa cause of action or defense asserted by the parties. The evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to thenon-moving party. In other words, we must view all of theevidence and the inferences drawn therefrom in the lightmost favorable to the party opposing the motion. 
Id. (citations omitted). 
Papaku counters that there was no genuine issue of 
material fact because: there was no dispute about the contents of
the Lease or the Assignment; a lease is reviewed under principlesof contract law; and the construction and legal effect to be given a contract is a question of law freely reviewable by an appellate court. McElroy, 107 Hawai# i at 429, 114 P.3d at 935.   
Papaku's motion for summary judgment was supported by a 
declaration from its real property manager. 
The declaration 
authenticated copies of the Lease and the Assignment. Straub did not controvert the authenticity or the content of the Lease or the Assignment.  Accordingly, the construction and legal effect 
to be given the Lease and the Assignment are questions of law that we review de novo. McElroy, 107 Hawai
#i at 429, 114 P.3d at 
935. 6
The Lease provides, in relevant part: 
[Papaku] . . . does hereby lease unto [Straub], and
[Straub] does hereby lease from [Papaku], those certain
. . . ("Premises") . . . upon the terms and conditionshereinafter set forth: 
1. SPECIFIC PROVISIONS: 
6 Straub's motion for summary judgment and opposition to Papaku's
motion were supported by a declaration from Straub's attorney authenticating
Papaku's notice to Kapono of her default and an accounting of payments due.Straub's reply memorandum included no declaration or exhibit. 
Papaku's opposition to Straub's motion attached an unsigned
declaration purporting to authenticate an email from Straub; because thedeclaration was unsigned, the circuit court should not have considered it whenruling on the cross-motions for summary judgment, and we do not consider it inour de novo review. Papaku did not file a reply memorandum on its own motionfor summary judgment.

6. Conformance. The provisions of the Lease are

This instrument is made on the express condition that nothing herein containedshall in any way be construed as affecting, impairing orwaiving any rights of [Papaku] under the Lease, except asamended pursuant to this Agreement. 
(Emphasis added.) 
1. Straub's Liability as Guarantor Underthe Lease and the Assignment 
First, Straub contends he "is released from his 
liability as a guarantor" because Papaku did not first attempt to 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
collect the debt from Kapono. Straub cites Lee v. Yano, 93 
Hawai#i 142, 997 P.2d 68 (App. 2000), in which we held: 
[A] guarantor does not promise the "same performance" as the
principal debtor. While a principal debtor promises to paya specified amount, a guarantor promises to pay that amountonly if it cannot be collected from the principal debtor.See Schweitzer v. Fishel, 13 Haw. 690, 693 (1901) (holding aguarantor and principal debtor were not "joint and severalobligors. They were severally parties to differentcontracts with the plaintiffs"). . . . 
. . . . 
. . . [T]he creditor has a duty to pursue collection fromthe debtor before pursuing collection from the guarantor.As noted in 
Schweitzer, supra, "under a contract of
guaranty, the guarantor is released from liability to theextent that [the guarantor] is injured by the neglect of thecreditor to press [the creditor's] claim with reasonablediligence against the principal debtor." Schweitzer, 13
Haw. at 693. 
Id. at 147-48, 997 P.2d at 74. Straub argues that Papaku's 
failure to obtain a default judgment against Kapono, and to exercise its creditors' remedies, before pursuing Straub under the personal guaranty absolves him from liability as Kapono's guarantor. 
Straub's contention lacks merit. "The respective 
rights of the guarantor and the creditor are determined by reference to the terms of the contract between them." McElroy, 
107 Hawai# i at 431, 114 P.3d at 937 (citation omitted). In 
McElroy we held that a guarantor of a lease waived the right to a jury trial by signing the guaranty, which stated that the guarantor "shall and do [sic] hereby waive trial by jury." Id. 
In this case, section 47 of the Lease constitutes a 
waiver by Straub, as guarantor, of all "defenses of a guarantor . . . , it being understood, acknowledged, and agreed by [Straub] that the liability of [Straub] shall be that of a principal obligor and that [Papaku] shall not be obligated to proceed against Tenant, any other guarantor of the performance of Tenant under this lease, or any other person, before proceeding against [Straub]." Similarly, the terms of the guaranty signed by Straub (Exhibit C to the Lease) made it "enforceable against [Straub] 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
without the necessity for any suit or proceedings on [Papaku]'s 
part of any kind or nature whatsoever against Tenant[.]" The Assignment made Kapono the tenant. Accordingly, Papaku had the right to proceed directly against Straub, as guarantor, for relief from Kapono's default without first having to obtain a judgment against Kapono.
Second, Straub contends that the terms of the guaranty 
provisions in the Lease and the Amendment are ambiguous and should be construed against the drafter, Papaku. The rule that ambiguities in a contract are construed against the drafter is not applied just because the contracting parties disagree about the terms of the contract and there is an assertion of ambiguity. Ambiguity is found, and the rule is applied, "only when the contract taken as a whole[] is reasonably subject to differing interpretation." Sturla, Inc. v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co., 67 
Haw. 203, 210, 684 P.2d 960, 964 (1984) (citation omitted). 
The provision Straub contends is ambiguous is paragraph 
5.a. of the Assignment. It states: 
(v) [Straub] agrees to remain as personal guarantor on
this lease for (1) one year. Providing [Kapono] has
remained in good standing with [Papaku] according to theterms and conditions of the entire Lease, [Papaku] shallthan [sic] release [Straub] as Guarantor and returnapplicable security deposit. 
Straub argues, "what is ambiguous is when that one-year term 
begins." 
There is no ambiguity. Paragraph 5 of the Assignment 
states: "Effective on [November 1, 2017], the Lease is hereby amended as follows . . ." Straub agreed to remain as personal guarantor for one year after the Assignment, until November 1, 2018. If at that time Kapono remained in good standing with Papaku under the Lease, Papaku would release Straub as guarantor and return his security deposit (Kapono having paid her own security deposit under the Assignment). Straub concedes that "on October 30, 2018, Kapono owed Papaku $17,044.37." Because the condition precedent to Straub's release as a guarantor was not 
10 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
satisfied, he remained a guarantor of his and Kapono's 
performance and was not entitled to a return of his security deposit. 
Straub argues that he is at most a guarantor of 
$17,044.37 of Kapono's debt to Papaku — the amount she owed on November 1, 2018. Straub misconstrues the unambiguous terms of the Assignment. Because Kapono was not in good standing under the Lease at the end of the year following the Assignment, Papaku was not obligated to release Straub as a guarantor and, as a guarantor, Straub is liable for the entire amount of Kapono's default. 
2. Straub's Continuing Liability as Tenant
Under the Lease 
Straub contends that the Assignment was a novation that 
released him from liability as the tenant under the Lease. "[A] 
discharge of a previous contractual duty is one of the essential elements of a novation." Hawaii Builders Supply Co. v. Kaneta, 
42 Haw. 111, 112, 1957 WL 10618, at **1 (1957). The terms of the Lease and of the Assignment stated that Straub was not released from his contractual duties under the Lease, except that he would be released from liability as a guarantor if Kapono remained in good standing under the Assignment for one year. As discussed above, the condition precedent to the guarantor release never occurred. See Id. at 115, 1957 WL 10618, at **3 ("Where the new 
agreement is conditional, it is possible that the parties agreed that on the happening of a condition there should be a novation, and that until and unless the condition happened, the original obligation should remain in force.") (citations omitted). 
The term of the Lease ended on June 30, 2020. The 
Lease provided that if Papaku consented to Straub's assignment of his tenant's interest in the Lease, Papaku's consent "shall not constitute a . . . release of [Straub] of the full performance by it [sic] of the covenants contained in this lease." In addition, Straub's assignee (Kapono) "shall assume and be deemed to have 
11 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
assumed this lease and shall be and remain liable jointly and 
severally with [Straub] for the payment of the rent, additional rent and adjustments of rent, and for the due performance of all the terms, covenants, conditions and agreements herein contained on [Straub]'s part to be performed for the term of this lease[.]" Accordingly, after the Assignment, Straub continued to be liable to Papaku for his obligations under the Lease. 
Section 3 of the Assignment provided that Papaku's 
consent "shall not be construed (a) as a release of [Straub] . . . from liability under the Lease or (b) except as specifically provided in Section 6 below, to modify, waive or affect (i) any of the provisions, covenants or conditions in the Lease[.]" Section 6 of the Assignment amended the Lease to conform to the provisions of Section 5 of the Assignment. Section 5 of the Assignment contained a conditional release of Straub's liability as guarantor. "[I]n all other respects, such provisions [of the Lease] are to be and continue in full force and effect." Under the plain language of the Lease and the Assignment, Straub continued to be liable as Tenant under the Lease until the Lease term ended on June 30, 2020. 
For the foregoing reasons, the "Order Granting 
Plaintiff's [sic] Papaku LLC's Motion for Summary Judgment Against Robert G [sic] Straub" entered on November 5, 2019, and the "Amended Judgment Against Robert G [sic] Straub" entered on February 24, 2020, are affirmed.
