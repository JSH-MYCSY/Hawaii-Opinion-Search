APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 16-1-1674-09 GWBC)
ORDER GRANTING NOVEMBER 14, 2019 MOTION TO
DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.)
Upon review of (1) Defendant-Appellee Ichida Kemp a
Limited Liability Law Company's (Ichida Kemp) November 14, 2019
motion to dismiss appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction,
(2) Plaintiff-Appellant Sara D. Warren's (Sara Warren), self-
represented, December 3, 2019 memorandum in opposition to Ichida
Kemp's November 14, 2019 motion, and (3)  the record, it appears
that we lack appellate jurisdiction over appellate court case
number CAAP-19-0000799 because a non-party and non-attorney named
John M. Warren (John Warren) is the lone signatory for Sara
Warren's and Plaintiff-Appellant Kailua 50 LLC's (Kailua 50 LLC),
self-represented, purported November 12, 2019 notice of appeal. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
We reject Ichida Kemp's initial argument that the
November 12, 2019 notice of appeal is untimely under Rule 4(a)(1)
of the Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) as to the
Honorable Gary W.B. Chang's October 10, 2019 judgment in Civil
No. 16-1-1674-09 GWBC.  The thirtieth calendar day after
October 10, 2019, was Saturday, November 9, 2019, and the
following Monday, November 11, 2019, was a state holiday.  HRAP
Rule 26(a) automatically extended the thirty-day time period
under HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) until Tuesday, November 12, 2019, when
the appellate clerk received the notice of appeal that was timely
as to the October 10, 2019 judgment.  See HRAP Rule 3(a) (When a
party submits a notice of appeal to the appellate clerk, "[t]he
date of receipt shall be deemed the date the notice of appeal was
filed with the appellate court.").
The jurisdictional defect in appellate court case
number CAAP-19-0000799 is the fact that the November 12, 2019
notice of appeal is invalid.  "A well-settled rule is that only
parties to a lawsuit may appeal an adverse judgment."  Gold v.
Harrison, 88 Hawai# i 94, 103, 962 P.2d 353, 362 (1998) (citations
and internal quotation marks omitted).  As a non-party in the
underlying case, John Warren lacked standing to appeal on behalf
of himself.  Abaya v. Mantell, 112 Hawai#i 176, 181, 145 P.3d
719, 724 (2006).
More significantly, as a non-attorney, John Warren
could not assert this appeal on behalf of Sara Warren, because,
under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 605-2 (2016) and HRS § 605-
14 (2016), non-attorneys "are not permitted to act as attorneys
and represent other natural persons in their causes."  Oahu
Plumbing and Sheet Metal, Ltd. v. Kona Constr., Inc., 60 Haw.
372, 377, 590 P.2d 570, 573 (1979). 
As an apparent concession, Sara Warren purports to
withdraw the appeal as to Kailua 50 LLC.  Nevertheless, for the
same reason why non-attorneys are not permitted to appear in
court on behalf of a natural person, a non-attorney such as John
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Warren is not allowed to represent a limited liability company
such as Kailua 50 LLC in litigation.1
The November 12, 2019 notice of appeal is invalid for
the purpose of invoking our appellate jurisdiction to review a
purported appeal by Sara Warren and Kailua 50 LLC because non-
party and non-attorney John Warren is the lone signatory for the
November 12, 2019 notice of appeal.  We decline to grant Ichida
Kemp's request to order John Warren to show cause why we should
not sanction him for practicing law in Hawai!i without a license.
Civil and criminal actions for violating HRS § 605-14 may by
brought by the attorney general.  See HRS §§ 605-15.1 and 605-
15.2. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Ichida Kemp's
November 14, 2019 motion to dismiss appeal is granted, and
1"By the same token, non-attorney agents are not allowed to
represent corporations in litigation, for a wholly unintended exception to the
rules against unauthorized practice of law would otherwise result."  Oahu
Plumbing and Sheet Metal, Ltd., 60 Haw. at 377, 590 P.2d at 574 (footnote
omitted).
Unlike lay agents of corporations, attorneys are subject to
professional rules of conduct and are amenable to
disciplinary action . . . for violations of ethical
standards. Therefore, attorneys, being fully accountable to
the courts, are properly designated to act as the
representatives of corporations.
Id. at 378, 590 P.2d at 574 (citation omitted); Reading International, Inc. v.
The Malulani Group, Ltd., 814 F.3d 1046, 1053 (9th Cir. 2016) ("A corporation
must be represented by counsel.").  The same principle applies to trusts, and,
thus, "[t]he general rule is that a trustee may not represent the trust in
litigation unless, having the right sought to be enforced, he is the real
party in interest."  Tradewinds Hotel, Inc. v. Conchran, 8 Haw. App. 256, 265,
799 P.2d 60, 65 (1990).  "Similar considerations apply to partnerships, and
have led most courts to conclude that a partnership may only appear in court
through counsel."  In re ICLNDS Notes Acquisition, LLC, 259 B.R. 289, 293–94
(Bankr. N.D. Ohio 2001); cf. Beamer v. Nishiki, 66 Haw. 572, 588, 670 P.2d
1264, 1276 (1983) ("Regardless of whether [a dissolved entity named] The
Valley Isle was a corporation or partnership, therefore, [former stockholders
or partners] Moore and Silva are real parties in interest and [the non-
attorney dissolution trustee] Reed's attempt to appear on behalf of the
dissolved The Valley Isle is actually an appearance on behalf of Moore and
Silva. . . .  Reed's activities thus constitute the unauthorized practice of
law.  Therefore, Reed, as trustee, will not be allowed to continue pro se in
his practice of law representing The Valley Isle.").  Similarly, regardless
"whether an LLC is viewed as a corporation or a partnership or a hybrid, it
may only appear in court through an attorney."  In re ICLNDS Notes
Acquisition, LLC, 259 B.R. at 294.
