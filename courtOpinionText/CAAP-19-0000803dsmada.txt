OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
RAYMOND KIM, Claimant-Appellant/Appellant, v.
INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION,
Employer-Appellee/Appellee, and LIBERTY MUTUAL INSURANCE,
Insurance Carrier-Appellee/Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
(CASE NO.: AB 2018-013; DCD NO. 2-04-13128)
ORDER GRANTING NOVEMBER 27, 2019 MOTION TO
DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.)
Upon review of (1) Employer/Appellee/Appellee
International Business Machines' (IBM) and Insurance Carrier/
Appellee/Appellee Liberty Mutual Insurance's (Liberty Mutual
Insurance) November 27, 2019 motion to dismiss appellate court
case number CAAP-19-0000803 for lack of jurisdiction, (2) the
lack of any memorandum by Claimant/Appellant/Appellant Raymond M.
Kim (Kim), self-represented, in opposition to IBM and Liberty
Mutual Insurance's November 27, 2019 motion, and (3) the record,
it appears that we do not have jurisdiction over Kim's appeal
from the State of Hawai# i Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals
Board's (the LIRAB)  October 7, 2019 order in LIRAB Case1
1The State of Hawai #i Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board
was composed of Chair Danny J. Vasconcellos, Member Melanie S. Matsui, and
Member Marie C.L. Laderta.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
No. 2018-013 pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 386-88
(2015) and HRS § 91-14(a) (2012 & Supp. 2018).
IBM's and Liberty Mutual Insurance's sole argument in
support of dismissal is that Kim did not file his November 7,
2019 notice of appeal within thirty days after the October 7,
2019 mailing of a certified copy of the LIRAB's October 7, 2019
order, as HRS § 386-88 required.  We note that, prior to 2013,
the only authorized manner for filing a notice of appeal from a
LIRAB proceeding was "by filing a written notice of appeal with
the appellate board."   HRS § 386-88 (Supp. 2012).  Although
court procedural rules, such as Rule 6(e) of the Hawai#i Rules of
Civil Procedure and Rule 26(c) of the Hawai#i Rules of Appellate
Procedure (HRAP), add two extra days to a prescribed time period
whenever the time period is measured from service by mail,
workers' compensation administrative proceedings take place
before the LIRAB instead of a court, and, thus, the governing
procedural rules for such LIRAB matters are in Hawai#i
Administrative Rules (HAR), Title 12, Chapter 47.  These
procedural rules, such as HAR § 12–47–18 (1994), HAR § 12–47–19
(1994) and HAR § 12–47–51 (1994), do not add two extra days for
service by mail.
In 2013, the Hawai# i legislature amended HRS § 386-88
by authorizing a new alternative option to electronically file a
notice of appeal from a LIRAB decision.  2013 Haw. Sess. Laws Act
14 § 2 at 18.  Consequently, the current version of HRS § 386-88
authorizes two ways to file a notice of appeal from an LIRAB
proceeding:
The decision or order of the appellate board shall be
final and conclusive, except as provided in section 386-89,
unless within thirty days after mailing of a certified copy
of the decision or order, the director or any other party
appeals to the intermediate appellate court, subject to
chapter 602, by filing a written notice of appeal with the
appellate board, or by electronically filing a notice of
appeal in accordance with the Hawaii rules of appellate
procedure. A fee in the amount prescribed by section 607-5
for filing a notice of appeal from a circuit court shall be
paid to the appellate board for filing the notice of appeal
from the board, which together with the appellate court
costs shall be deemed costs of the appellate court
proceeding. The appeal shall be on the record, and the court
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
shall review the appellate board's decision on matters of
law only. No new evidence shall be introduced in the
appellate court, except that if evidence is offered that is
clearly newly discovered evidence and material to the just
decision of the appeal, the court may admit the evidence.
HRS § 386-88 (2015) (emphases added).  The legislative history
for the 2013 amendment to HRS § 386-88 indicates that the
legislature's purpose for the amendment did not include any
intent to change all of the procedural rules governing workers'
compensation proceedings before the LIRAB, and, instead, the
legislature's purpose was simply to provide the parties in
workers' compensation proceedings with an optional second way of
filing a notice of appeal, namely by filing notices of appeal
electronically with the Judiciary Electronic Filing and Service
System (JEFS).  See Hse Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 94 in 2013 House
Journal, at 933; Hse Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 626 in 2013 House
Journal, at 1129; Sen. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 961 in 2013 Senate
Journal, at 1314-15 ; Sen. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1245 in 2013
Senate Journal, at 1459.  Thus, we apply the Hawai#i Rules of
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) to appeals from workers' compensation
matters before the LIRAB only to the limited extent that the
HRAP, such as HRAP Rule 3 and HRAP Rule 25, directly address and
authorize electronic filing with JEFS.  The timing of any appeal
from a workers' compensation matter before the LIRAB remains as
provided by HRS § 386-88 and the relevant Hawai#i Administrative
Rules (HAR) such as HAR § 12–47–18, HAR § 12–47–19 and HAR
§ 12–47–51, which do not add two extra days when there is service
of a LIRAB decision by mail.2
2For example:
Your Committee further finds that existing law does
not specifically authorize workers' compensation litigants
to file electronic notices of appeal with the appellate
court, which is currently available through the Judiciary
Electronic Filing System.  This measure assists in
increasing state government efficiency and reducing the
State's carbon footprint by allowing the electronic filing
of workers' compensation claim appeal notices.

3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
In the instant case, the event that triggered the
thirty-day time period under HRS § 386-88 for filing a notice of
appeal was the LIRAB's October 7, 2019 mailing of a certified
copy of the LIRAB's October 7, 2019 order.  Kim did not file his
November 7, 2019 notice of appeal within thirty days after the
October 7, 2019 mailing of a certified copy of the LIRAB's
October 7, 2019 order, in violation of HRS § 386-88, and, thus,
Kim's appeal is untimely.  The failure to file a timely notice of
appeal in a civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the
parties cannot waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in
the exercise of judicial discretion.  Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw.
648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986).  We lack appellate
jurisdiction over Kim's untimely appeal.
Although not mentioned by IBM and Liberty Mutual
Insurance, Kim also did not sign his November 7, 2019 notice of
appeal.  Instead, a non-party and non-attorney named Vivian E.
Kim (Vivian Kim) is the lone signatory for Kim's November 7, 2019
notice of appeal.  "A well-settled rule is that only parties to a
lawsuit may appeal an adverse judgment."  Gold v. Harrison, 88
Hawai#i 94, 103, 962 P.2d 353, 362 (1998) (citations and internal
quotation marks omitted).  As a non-party in the underlying case,
Vivian E. Kim lacks standing to appeal on behalf of herself. 
Abaya v. Mantell, 112 Hawai#i 176, 181, 145 P.3d 719, 724 (2006).
Further, as a non-attorney, Vivian E. Kim cannot
prosecute this appeal on behalf of Kim before this court,
because, under HRS § 605-2 (2016) and HRS § 605-14 (2016), non-
attorneys "are not permitted to act as attorneys and represent
other natural persons in their causes."  Oahu Plumbing and Sheet
Metal, Ltd. v. Kona Constr., Inc., 60 Haw. 372, 377, 590 P.2d
570, 573 (1979) (citation and footnote omitted).  In fact, "[a]ny
person violating sections 605-14 to 605-16 shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor."  HRS § 605-17 (2016).  Therefore, as a non-
attorney, Vivian Kim lacks legal authority to prosecute this
appeal on behalf of Kim before this court.
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
HAR § 12-147-10 (1994) apparently authorizes various
non-attorneys to appear on behalf of a party in proceedings
before the LIRAB, including a "duly appointed representative":
§ 12-47-10. Appearance and practice before the board.
(a) An individual may appear in his or her own behalf;
a partner may represent the partnership; a bona fide officer
of a corporation, trust, or association may represent the
corporation, trust, or association; and an officer or
employee of the State or a political subdivision of the
State may represent the agency in any proceeding before the
board.
(b) A person may be represented by an attorney or
other duly appointed representative, including, but not
limited to, insurance representatives and union
representatives in any proceeding under this chapter.
(Emphases added).  Nevertheless, the record on appeal does not
show that Vivian Kim was a duly appointed representative of Kim
in the workers' compensation proceedings before the LIRAB. 
Therefore, as a non-party and non-attorney, Vivian Kim was not
authorized to sign and file the November 7, 2019 notice of appeal
on behalf of Kim.  Without the signature of Kim or an attorney
who is licensed to practice law in Hawai#i, the November 7, 2019
notice of appeal is invalid, and we lack appellate jurisdiction
for this reason as well.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellees IBM and
Appellee Liberty Mutual Insurance's November 27, 2019 motion to
dismiss appellate court case number CAAP-19-0000803 is granted,
and we dismiss appellate court case number CAAP-19-0000803 for
lack of appellate jurisdiction.
