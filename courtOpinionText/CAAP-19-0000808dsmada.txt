IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI#I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
LORENZO PELAYO, Defedant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CR. NO. 1CPC-18-0001245)
ORDER GRANTING IN PART MOTION TO WITHDRAW APPEAL
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.)
Upon consideration of Defendant-Appellant Lorenzo
Pelayo's (Pelayo) February 4, 2020 Motion to Withdraw Appeal, the
papers in support, and the record, it appears that (1) the appeal
has been docketed; (2)  Pelayo seeks to dismiss the appeal without
prejudice, under Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 42(b);
and (3) there appears to be good cause to dismiss the appeal.1
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion is
granted in part, and the appeal is dismissed.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai#i, February 14, 2020.

1  We note that the purported declaration of counsel, which is
"[a]pproved to form" by Pelayo, does not meet the requirements of Rule 42(c)
of the Hawai#i Rules of Appellate Procedure.  We dismiss the appeal because
the appeal was filed before a sentence was entered and thus we lack appellate
jurisdiction.
