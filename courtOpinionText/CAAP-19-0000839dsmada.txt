MAI, LLC, Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellee, v.
RUDOLF HELDER, Defendant-Counterclaimant/Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
HONOLULU DIVISION
(CIVIL NO. 1RC18-1-8199)
ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL
(By: Chan, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.)
Upon review of (1) the February 10, 2020 motion by
Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellee Mai, LLC (Mai ) to
dismiss appeal number CAAP-19-0000839 for lack of appellate
jurisdiction ( Motion to Dismiss ), (2) a February 18, 2020
statement of jurisdiction and memorandum by Defendant/Counter-
claimant/Appellant Rudolf Helder ( Helder) in response to the
Motion to Dismiss, and (3) the record, it appears that we lack
appellate jurisdiction over Helder's appeal from the district
court's November 6, 2019 order granting Mai's motion for partial
summary judgment as to Count 3 of Helder's first amended
counterclaim.  The November 6, 2019 order does not resolve all of
the claims in Mai's complaint and in Helder's first amended
counterclaim, as Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-1(a) (2016)
requires for an appeal from a district court civil case. 
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai# i 425, 426, 984 P.2d 1251,
1252 (1999).  We decline Helder's request that we stay thisElectronically Filed

appeal pending the future entry of judgment on the remaining
claims because we lack jurisdiction to do so.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion to
Dismiss is granted, and appeal number CAAP-19-0000839 is
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, April 7, 2020.
