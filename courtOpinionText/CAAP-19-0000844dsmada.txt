IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
KE NOHO KAI COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION, by its Board of Directors,
Plaintiff-Appellant, v. ARMANDO SEDANO; Defendant-Appellee,

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 17-1-0680-04 (DEO)) 
ORDER 
DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
AND 
DISMISSING ALL PENDING MOTIONS AS MOOT 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
appellate jurisdiction over Plaintiff-Appellant Ke Noho Kai 
Community Association's (
Ke Noho Kai) appeal from the November 8, 
2019 "Final Judgment Re: Order Denying Plaintiff's Motion For 
Attorney's Fees and Costs Filed July 31, 2019" (11/8/19 
Judgment), by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court), which was entered based on an order denying Ke Noho Kai's 
motion for attorneys' fees and costs and requiring Ke Noho Kai to 
pay Defendant-Appellee Armando Sedano's (Sedano) special counsel 
fees. The 11/8/19 Judgment does not adjudicate any of Ke Noho 
Kai's multiple causes of action alleged against Sedano. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-1(a) 
(2016) and Rule 58 of the Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP), "[a]n appeal may be taken from circuit court orders 
resolving claims
 against parties only after the orders have been 
reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor 
of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to 
HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright
, 76 
Hawai# i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994) (emphasis added). 
Although Ke Noho Kai asserted three separate counts in 
its April 26, 2017 complaint against Sedano, the 11/8/19 Judgment does not resolve any of those claims. 
The 11/8/19 Judgment is 
not appropriate for certification pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b) because HRCP Rule 54(b) "certification of finality is limited to 
only those cases where . . . the judgment entered completely 
disposes of at least one claim or all of the claims by or against 
at least one party." Elliot Megdal & Assocs. v. Daio USA Corp.
, 
87 Hawai# i 129, 133, 952 P.2d 886, 890 (App.1998) (citation 
omitted). In the instant case, the circuit court has not yet 
adjudicated any of Ke Noho Kai's claims, which remain pending 
before the circuit court. 
A "circuit court's order awarding attorneys' fees and 
costs may not be certified as a final judgment, pursuant to HRCP 
Rule 54(b), because such an order is not a final decision with 
respect to a claim for relief." Fujimoto v. Au
, 95 Hawai# i 116, 
136 n.16, 19 P.3d 699, 719 n.16 (2001) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); 
see also CRSC, Inc. v. Sage Diamond 
Co., Inc.
, 95 Hawai# i 301, 307, 22 P.3d 97, 103 (App. 2001). In 
Fujimoto
, 95 Hawai# i at 122-23, 19 P.3d at 705-06, the Hawai# i 
Supreme Court held it did not have appellate jurisdiction to review a "final judgment" entered on April 20, 1999, that awarded 
a defendant [Jorgensen] $
7,591.48 in attorneys' fees and costs. 
The court explained: 
This court does not have jurisdiction over the appeal and
cross-appeal of the "judgment" in favor of Jorgensen andagainst the plaintiffs, filed on April 20, 1999, inasmuch asthe document filed by the circuit court does not expresslyenter judgment in Jorgensen's favor with respect to the 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
plaintiffs' substantive claims against him, but merely
refers to the entry of the summary judgment orders thatdisposed of those claims. Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming &Wright
, 76 Hawai #i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994).
Absent entry of an appealable final judgment on the claimsagainst Jorgensen, the award of attorneys' fees and costs islikewise not appealable. 
Id. at 123, 19 P.3d at 706. Here, absent an appealable final 
judgment on Ke Noho Kai's claims, the circuit court's judgment 
awarding Sedano's special counsel fees is not yet eligible for 
appellate review. 
Further, the 11/8/19 Judgment is not appealable under 
the collateral order doctrine. In Harada v. Ellis
, 60 Haw. 467, 
480-81, 591 P.2d 1060, 1070 (1979), the Hawai# i Supreme Court 
held it had jurisdiction to review an order requiring defendants 
to pay a sanction of $145.60 for failure to provide discovery. 
The court explained that "the order directed payment of the 
assessed sum and was immediately enforceable through contempt 
proceedings[,]" citing to 
MDG Supply Co. v. Ellis, 51 Haw. 480, 
463 P.2d 530 (1969). Here, the 11/8/19 Judgment is not a sanction, nor is it immediately enforceable through contempt 
proceedings. 
Ke Noho Kai's appeal in CAAP-19-0000844 is thus 
premature, and we lack appellate jurisdiction. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that case number CAAP-
19-0000844 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions 
are dismissed as moot.
