MEMORANDUM OPINION 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Wadsworth and McCullen, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Jamison Crowe (
Crowe) appeals from 
a Judgment and Notice of Entry of Judgment (
Judgment) filed in 
the District Court of the Second Circuit (District Court)1 on 
November 13, 2019, in which he was convicted of violating Hawaii 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-62(a).2 The Judgment was entered 
pursuant to a no contest plea in which Crowe reserved the right to appeal the District Court's denial of his motion to suppress evidence. 
On appeal, Crowe contends the District Court erred when 
it denied his suppression motion and concluded that: 
1 The Honorable Kirstin M. Hamman presided. 
2 § 291E-62(a) (2020) provides, in part: "No person whose license and
privilege to operate a vehicle have been revoked, suspended, or otherwise
restricted pursuant to . . . section 291E-61 . . . shall operate or assumeactual physical control of any vehicle[.]"  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

(2) a police officer's demand for Crowe's driver's 
license was within the constitutional scope of an intoxication 
roadblock. 
For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the District 
Court's denial of Crowe's suppression motion, and thus, also affirm the Judgment. 
I. Background 
On March 8, 2019, Maui Police Department (MPD) Officer 
James Burkett (Officer Burkett) stopped Crowe at an intoxication 
roadblock. Officer Burkett asked Crowe for his license and 
insurance information. Crowe responded that he did not have a license. Officer Burkett asked Crowe why he did not have one, and Crowe responded that it was possibly suspended. Officer Burkett checked Crowe's driver's license status, and determined it was suspended for operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant (OVUII). Officer Burkett cited Crowe for violating 
HRS § 291E-62(a). 
On March 19, 2019, Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai# i 
(State) filed an Amended Complaint charging Crowe with: Count I, 
Operating a Vehicle after License and Privilege Have Been 
Suspended or Revoked for OVUII, in violation of HRS § 291E-62; Count II, Driving While License Suspended or Revoked in violation of HRS § 286-132; and Count III, Driving Without a License in violation of HRS § 286-102. 
Crowe filed a Motion to Suppress all evidence related 
to Officer Burkett's request for Crowe's license, arguing that the request violated Crowe's rights under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution
6 and article I, section 7 of the 
(b)
 Nothing in this section shall prohibit the establishment of
procedures to make roadblock programs less intrusive than required
by the minimum standards provided in this section. 
6 U.S. CONST. amend. IV provides: 
The right of the people to be secure in their persons,houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable 
(continued...) 
3 6(...continued) NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawai#i Constitution.7 Specifically, Crowe argued that MPD's 
Document Check Rule violated the Authorizing Statutes and Crowe's 
constitutional protections. The District Court denied the Motion to Suppress, entering its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying Defendant's Motion to Suppress (Order Denying
Motion to Suppress). 
Subsequently, pursuant to a plea agreement, Crowe 
pleaded no contest to Count I, maintained his right to appeal the 
Order Denying Motion to Suppress, and the State dismissed Counts II and III with prejudice. The District Court entered Judgment on November 13, 2019. 
II. Discussion 
A. The Document Check Rule does not invalidate MPD's 
roadblock intoxication program 
A lower court's ruling on a motion to suppress is 
reviewed on appeal de novo to determine whether the ruling was 
right or wrong. State v. Rodgers, 99 Hawai# i 70, 72, 53 P.3d 
209, 211 (2002). 
The District Court's Order Denying Motion to Suppress 
made the following relevant findings and conclusions: 
FINDINGS OF FACT 
1. On March 8, 2019, officers of the Maui
Police Department ("MPD") conducted an intoxication
control roadblock near the intersection of Piilani Highway and Kulanihakoi Street. 
searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and noWarrants shall issue, but upon probable cause,supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularlydescribing the place to be searched, and the personsor things to be seized. 
7 Article I, section 7 of the Hawai #i Constitution provides: 
The right of the people to be secure in their persons,houses, papers and effects against unreasonablesearches, seizures and invasions of privacy shall notbe violated; and no warrants shall issue but uponprobable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, andparticularly describing the place to be searched andthe persons or things to be seized or thecommunications sought to be intercepted.

2. At 9:10 p.m., Defendant was stopped at the
intoxication control roadblock without an arrest or 
search warrant. 
3. Officer James Burkett made contact with 
Defendant. 
4. Officer Burkett did not observe any
irregularities in Defendant's driving when Defendantstopped his vehicle at the intoxication controlroadblock. 
5. Upon contact with Defendant, Officer
Burkett did not observe any physical signs indicatingthe Defendant was under the influence of an intoxicant. Defendant did not exhibit red, wateryeyes, flushed, oily facial features, slurred speech,and Officer Burkett did not detect the odor of liquor. 
6. After explaining the purpose of the stop
and observing Defendant, Officer Burkett demanded thatDefendant provide his license and proof of insurance. 
7. Sergeant Greg Rowe was the assigned
supervisor for the intoxication control roadblockconducted on March 8, 2019. 
8. Sergeant Rowe testified that officers at
the intoxication control roadblock are required todemand license and insurance information from motorist stopped at the intoxication control roadblock. 
9. Such a demand is made pursuant to the
Rules and Practice and Procedure Relating toIntoxicant Control Roadblock Program ("IntoxicationRoadblock Rules"), specifically § 13-102-06(i)("Document Check Rule") and is based on therequirement in HRS §286-116 to ask for a driverlicense and proof of insurance. 
10. When Defendant could not provide proof of
a valid license, Officer Burkett ordered Defendant toproceed to the intoxication control roadblock holdingarea. 
11. In the holding area, Officer Burkett
issued Defendant a citation related to his inabilityto provide a valid license. 
12. Officer Burkett issued this citation at 
9:19 p.m., nine minutes after Defendant's initialseizure. 
. . . . 
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 
. . . . 
10. The roadblock in this case was 
constitutionally valid under [
Michigan Dept. of State
Police v. Sitz, 496 U.S. 444 (1990)] balancing testbecause it complied with the minimum standards for 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
roadblock procedures established in HRS 291E-20 and
Maui's less intrusive roadblock rules established pursuant to HRS 291E-19 and Chapter 91. 
. . . . 
15. In 
State v. Aguinaldo, 71 Hawai #i 57, 782
P.2d 1225 (1989), the Defendant challenged herdetention at a roadblock and demand for her driver's license and insurance card as a warrantless search. The Defendant in Aguinaldo argued that the statutesauthorizing the police to establish intoxicationroadblocks did not expressly authorize police officersto enforce other traffic laws at the time of the roadblock stop. 
16. The Aguinaldo court noted that while the
statutes authorizing intoxication roadblocks "do notexpressly authorize enforcement of other traffic laws,they also do not prohibit it." Id. 71 Hawai #i at 58,
782 P.2d at 1226. 
17. The Aguinaldo court reasoned that because
Hawaii Revised Statutes §286-116 requires policeofficers when stopping a vehicle for any reason todemand that the driver or owner display the driver'sor owners driver's license and insurance identification card, officers are "statutorilyauthorized to enforce the laws requiring drivers tohave with them a valid driver's license and a no-fault insurance card by demanding that the same be producedwhen a stop is validly made." Id. 71 Hawai #i at 61,
782 P.2d at 1228. 
18. The Aguinaldo court also ruled, "Hawai #i 
law requires possession of no-fault insuranceidentification card in addition to a driver's license for the operation of a motor vehicle. 
We, therefore,
hold that the police has the power and authority todemand from the driver of a vehicle the production ofboth whenever the vehicle is validly stopped." Id. at 
71 Hawai #i at 64, 782 P.2d at 1229. 
19. The Defendant argues that when Aguinaldo
was decided, HRS §291E-19 was codified as HRS§286-162.5, and HRS §291-20 was codified as §286-162.6and, therefore, is inapplicable to this case.According to Defendant, the 
Aguinaldo court "did not
consider the issue in this case-whether the adoptionof a rule requiring a document check is permissibleunder the Authorization Statutes express prohibitionon more intrusive intoxication roadblock measures." Def. Mot. To Supp. at page 11. However, the expressprohibition on more intrusive intoxication roadblockmeasures is the same express prohibition that wascontained in HRS §286-162.5 when Aguinaldo wasdecided. Although the Aguinaldo court was analyzingHRS §286-116 and not a rule promulgated by the policedepartment, the Document Check Rule is based on HRS§286-116. Aguinaldo is applicable to this case. 
. . . . 
6  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
22. In this case, Defendant was validly
stopped at an intoxication roadblock. It is required
under HRS §286-116 for officers to ask for a driver'slicense and insurance card when conducting a vehiclestop. HRS §286-116 serves as the basis for theDocument Check Rule promulgated by the policedepartment. Officer Burkett issued the Defendant a citation nine minutes after the initial seizure. Detaining the Defendant while writing the citation didnot expand the scope of the initial stop as it did in[State v. Iona, 144 Hawai #i 412, 443 P.3d 104 (2019)].
Requesting the Defendant's driver's license andinsurance card is reasonably related to the initialstop unlike the warrant check in Iona. 
. . . . 
25. The initial stop was valid and the request
for Defendant's license and insurance card was reasonably related in scope to the initial stop. 
The focus in this case is Officer Burkett's request to 
Crowe to produce his driver's license during the intoxication 
roadblock stop. In our view, the Hawai# i Supreme Court's 
decision in State v. Aguinaldo, 71 Haw. 57, 782 P.2d 1225 (1989) is dispositive. The facts in Aguinaldo were summarized as 
follows: 
On July 26, 1988, Maui police set up an intoxication
control roadblock at Firebreak Road and Haleakala Highway. Defendant–Appellee Lynn Aguinaldo wasdriving a vehicle which was routinely stopped for acheck. When the police officer had an opportunity toobserve Aguinaldo, it was apparent that she was notintoxicated. The police officer, as a matter of
routine, then asked Aguinaldo to produce her driver'slicense and no-fault insurance card. When Aguinaldowas unable to do so, the police officer cited her forfailure to produce a current driver's license andproof of car insurance. 
Id. at 58, 782 P.2d at 1226 (emphases added). Aguinaldo moved to 
suppress the citation. Id.The trial court granted the motion 
on the following grounds: 
(1) the highway safety statutes relating to
intoxication control roadblock programs do notauthorize police officers to enforce any other lawsthan those relating to driving under the influence ofintoxicating substances (DUI) at an intoxicationroadblock, and (2) the police had no probable cause todetain and question Aguinaldo once it was determinedthat she was not violating any DUI laws. 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Id. at 58-59, 782 P.2d at 1226. The State appealed. Id. at 59, 
782 P.2d at 1226. The Hawai# i Supreme Court reversed, reasoning 
that: 
While the roadblock statutes do not expressly
authorize police to enforce other traffic laws at DUIroadblock stops, neither do they prohibit it. 
A separate section of the highway safety laws, HRS § 286–116
(1985), authorizes "[e]very police officer or lawenforcement officer when stopping a vehicle or inspecting a
vehicle for any reason  [to] demand that the driver or owner
display the driver's or owner's driver's license and
insurance identification card." (Emphasis added.) 
"Laws in pari materia, or upon the same subject matter,
shall be construed with reference to each other. What is clear in one statute may be called in aid to explain what isdoubtful in another." HRS § 1–16 (1985); see also Zator v.State Farm Mutual Auto Ins. Co., 70 Haw. 594, ––––, 752 P.2d1073, 1075 (1988). 
Both the roadblock statutes and HRS § 286–116 pertain to
police powers in ensuring highway safety. HRS § 286–116authorizes the police to demand the production of a driver'slicense and no-fault insurance card whenever the police stopa vehicle for any reason. 
We interpret "for any reason" to mean stopping vehicles for
any valid reason. . . . 
When the roadblock statutes are read in conjunction
with § 286–116, it is clear that the police arestatutorily authorized to enforce the laws requiringdrivers to have with them a valid driver's license and a no-fault insurance card by demanding that the samebe produced when a stop is validly made. 
Id. at 60-61, 782 P.2d at 1227-28 (emphasis added) (footnote and 
citation omitted). 
In Aguinaldo, the defendant stipulated that the stop of 
her vehicle pursuant to the intoxication roadblock was constitutionally valid, thus the supreme court did not addressthe propriety of requesting a driver's license pursuant to HRS  
§ 286-116 (2020)
8 where no such stipulation was made. Id. at 62, 
782 P.2d at 1228. However, the Hawai# i Supreme Court did address 
8 We note that the pertinent language in HRS § 286-116(a) is identical
to the version applicable in Aguinaldo. See HRS § 286-116(a); Aguinaldo, 71
Haw. at 60 n.2, 782 P.2d at 1227 n.2. HRS § 286-116(a) (2020) provides, in
relevant part: "Every police officer or law enforcement officer when stoppinga vehicle or inspecting a vehicle for any reason shall demand that the driveror owner display the driver's or owner's driver's license and insuranceidentification card." (Emphasis added.) 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
an asserted lack of connection between the stop and the license 
inquiry, adopting the following rationale from an Oregon case: 
Although the officer's request for identification or a
driver's license did not directly relate to thepurpose of the roadblock, it certainly related to thedefendant's status as the driver of the car. We hold that if an automobile is validly stopped by a lawenforcement officer, the officer may request theoperator's driver's license. 
Aguinaldo, 71 Haw. at 63, 782 P.2d at 1228 (quoting State v. 
Tourtillott, 618 P.2d 423, 435 (Or. 1980)). Based on the foregoing rationale, the Hawai# i Supreme Court concluded: 
Hawaii law requires possession of [a] no-fault
insurance identification card in addition to a driver's license for the operation of a motor vehicle.We, therefore, hold that the police has [sic] thepower and authority to demand from the driver of avehicle the production of both whenever the vehicle isvalidly stopped. In this case, Aguinaldo stipulatedthat the roadblock stop was constitutionally valid,therefore, the demand for production of her driver'slicense and proof of no-fault insurance was alsoconstitutionally permissible. 
Id., 71 Haw. at 63, 782 P.2d at 1229 (emphasis added) (footnote 
omitted). 
Here, Crowe seeks to distinguish Aguinaldo by asserting 
that his stop was not valid because the MPD's intoxication roadblock program is designed in an invalid manner due to inclusion of the Document Check Rule. In short, Crowe argues that, even if Officer Burkett had the authority to demand his driver's license, the Authorization Statutes were violated by designing the MPD's intoxication roadblock program to mandate such action. 
We conclude Crowe's argument is unavailing. The 
Document Check Rule expressly cites to HRS § 286-116 as authority for the driver to produce a driver's license. See § 13-102-06(i) 
of the County of Maui Police Department's Rules of Practice and Procedure Relating to Intoxicant Control Roadblock Program. We decline to rule that the entire MPD intoxication roadblock program is invalid because the MPD rules also incorporate a provision that is correct under HRS § 286-116. As the Hawai# i 
Supreme Court recognized in Aguinaldo, HRS § 286-116 and the 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Authorizing Statutes are laws in pari materia. 71 Haw. at 60-61, 
782 P.2d at 1227. Further, Crowe does not challenge any other part of the intoxication roadblock program or assert that any other conduct by police was improper or invalid. Thus, we conclude the intoxication roadblock was valid and, as in Aguinaldo, Officer Burkett was authorized under HRS § 286-116 to demand that Crowe produce his driver's license. Crowe's argument seeking to distinguish Aguinaldo lacks merit. 
We thus reject Crowe's first point of error.
B. The District Court did not err in concluding that the
demand for Crowe's license was within the constitutional scope of the intoxication roadblock 
With regard to Crowe's second point of error, he 
appears to challenge the following conclusions in the District 
Court's Order Denying Motion to Suppress: 
20. Defendant also asserts that Aguinaldo is
inapplicable to this case because Aguinaldo was
decided before State v. Perez, 111 Hawai #i 392, 141
P.3d 1039 (2006), and State v. Iona, 144 Hawai #i 412,
443 P.3d 104 (2019). 
In Perez
, the court held that an
investigative stop must be (1) justified at itsinception and (2) reasonably related in scope to thecircumstances which justified the interference in thefirst place. Perez, 111 Hawai #i at 397, 141 P.3d at
1044. 
Defendant argues that the Document Check Rule
impermissibly expands the scope of the intoxicationroadblock stop. Def. Mot. To Supp. at page 7. 
21. Perez and 
Iona are distinguishable from
this case. In Iona the defendant was stopped forriding a bicycle with an expired tax decal. Iona 144 Hawai #i at 414, 443 P.3d at 106. The officers 
detained the defendant longer than it would have takento write a citation in order to do a warrant check. Id. When it was discovered the defendant had an outstanding warrant, a pat-down revealed defendant wasin possession of drugs. Id. The Iona Court held that 
because the warrant check came back after the span oftime necessary for the police to obtain Iona'sidentifying information from him and to write andissue the citation, Iona's arrest was illegal. 
22. In this case, Defendant was validly
stopped at an intoxication roadblock. It is requiredunder HRS §286-116 for officers to ask for a driver'slicense and insurance card when conducting a vehiclestop. HRS §286-116 serves as the basis for theDocument Check Rule promulgated by the policedepartment. Officer Burkett issued the Defendant a citation nine minutes after the initial seizure. Detaining the Defendant while writing the citation did 
10 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
not expand the scope of the initial stop as it did in
Iona. Requesting the Defendant's driver's license andinsurance card is reasonably related to the initialstop unlike the warrant check in Iona. 
23. In Perez, police arrested the defendant
for shoplifting. During a pat down search of thedefendant, police found a coin purse. Suspecting thecoin purse may have drugs, the police detained Perezbeyond the period necessary to process Perez on theshoplifting charge in order to get a canine narcoticsscreening of the coin purse. The Perez Court held that the delay to conduct the search of the coin purse"was not reasonably related either in time or to thecircumstances which might have justified it (i.e., theshoplifting arrest and a search for evidence of thatoffense) in the first place, and it cannotretroactively be sanitized under the umbrella of theearlier arrest". Perez 111 Hawai #i at 398, 141 P.3d
at 1045. 
24. Unlike Perez, Officer Burkett's request
for the Defendant's license and insurance card pursuant to the Document Check Rule was reasonablyrelated in time and to the circumstances which justified it in the first place (i.e., theintoxication roadblock stop). 
25. The initial stop was valid and the request
for Defendant's license and insurance card was reasonably related in scope to the initial stop. 
Crowe argues the District Court erroneously concluded 
that "a demand to produce information for the purpose of 
investigating separate, unrelated offenses was reasonably related to the purpose of the intoxication roadblock seizure and did not expand the scope of this seizure." In short, Crowe seems to assert that where the purpose of the intoxication roadblock was to address impaired driving, it was beyond the constitutional scope of that purpose to also investigate his license status. Given the circumstances of this case, we reject Crowe's argument and conclude the District Court correctly determined that the demand for Crowe's license was proper and reasonably related in scope to the intoxication roadblock stop. 
In addressing this point, it is important to 
distinguish between the analysis underlying the constitutionality 
11 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of a Terry stop9 and an intoxication roadblock stop. A Terry 
stop is a "temporary investigative detention of an individual by 
the police without a warrant," which is "strictly tied to and justified by the circumstances which rendered its initiation permissible." State v. Iona, 144 Hawai# i 412, 416, 443 P.3d 104, 
108 (2019) (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Terry, 392 U.S. at 19). 
In contrast, an intoxication roadblock stop is 
"justified on the premise that systematic and non-discriminatory seizures minimally intrude upon an individual's privacy" and advance the public interest against drunk driving. State v. 
Heapy, 113 Hawai# i 283, 300, 151 P.3d 764, 781 (2007). Davis v. 
Kansas Dep't of Revenue, 843 P.2d 260 (Kan. 1992), provides a helpful explanation of this distinction: 
Sitz recognized a distinction between a Terry stop and
a systematic roadside checkpoint stop. Such a 
checkpoint stop was found to be constitutional and
falls outside the Terry analysis. Sitz rests on a 
branch of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence in which the
Court employs a balancing test to evaluate theconstitutionality of various police stop situations. 
Id. at 262 (citations omitted, emphasis added). Sitz 
jurisprudence is applicable here. See Michigan Dep't of State 
Police v. Sitz, 496 U.S. 444 (1990) (upholding the 
constitutionality of a sobriety checkpoint program). 
Sitz adopted a balancing test set forth in United 
States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543 (1976) and Brown v. Texas, 443 U.S. 47 (1979), to determine the constitutionality of an intoxication roadblock. Sitz, 496 U.S. at 450. The test 
involves a "weighing of the gravity of the public concerns served by the seizure, the degree to which the seizure advances the public interest, and the severity of the interference with individual liberty." Brown, 443 U.S. at 50-51. 
Here, except for the arguments based on the Document 
Check Rule, which we rejected above, Crowe does not assert that 
9 Terry v. Ohio , 392 U.S. 1 (1968). 
12 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the intoxication roadblock was invalid. Therefore, under the 
circumstances of this case, and given our determination that the intoxication roadblock was valid, Officer Burkett's request for Crowe's license was constitutionally permissible. See Aguinaldo, 
71 Haw. at 63, 782 P.2d at 1229 (holding that the "roadblock stop was constitutionally valid, therefore, the demand for production of her driver's license and proof of no-fault insurance was also constitutionally permissible.").

Notice of Entry of Judgment filed in the District Court of the Second Circuit on November 13, 2019, is affirmed.
