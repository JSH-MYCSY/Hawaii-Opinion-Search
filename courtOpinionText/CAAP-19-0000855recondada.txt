NO. CAAP-19-0000855 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
AL R. NACINO, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v. 
CAMBRIDGE MANAGEMENT, INC., Defendant-Appellee,
and 
JOHN DOES 1-5; JANE DOES 1-5; DOE CORPORATIONS 1-5; DOE LLCS 1-5;
DOE PARTNERSHIPS 1-5; DOE NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS 1-5; and DOE
GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES 1-5, Defendants 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(Civil No. 1CC161001853) 
ORDER 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Hiraoka and McCullen, JJ.) 
Upon review of the Motion for Reconsideration filed by 
Defendant-Appellee Cambridge Management, Inc. on October 5, 2022, 
the papers in support, and the record, it appears that Cambridge moves for reconsideration of our Summary Disposition Order (
SDO) 
filed on September 26, 2022. 
Cambridge contends that the SDO failed to focus on the 
first element of a prima facie case of retaliation under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 378-2(a)(2). Citing Gonsalves v. Nissan 
Motor Corp.
, 100 Hawai# i 149, 163, 58 P.3d 1196, 1210 (2002), 
Cambridge argues "Nacino failed to demonstrate that he had an 
objectively reasonable belief when he filed the earlier lawsuit that he was complaining about . . . discrimination based upon his  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
race, national origin, sex, or other characteristic protected 
under HRS § 378-2." 
The circuit court's order granting Cambridge's MSJ 
stated: 
[T]he record does not establish that [Nacino] had an
objectively reasonable basis to believe he had beendiscriminated against based on his race, national origin orskin color (or any other characteristic protected underpart I of HRS Chapter 378). 
As stated in our SDO, Nacino's Discrimination Lawsuit 
complaint alleged that he was "subjected to adverse employment 
actions" including "harassment, discrimination, retaliation and disparate treatment" by Cambridge in violation of HRS § 378-2. Cambridge's MSJ was not based upon claim or issue preclusion; 
thus, the ultimate disposition of the Discrimination Lawsuit in 
favor of Cambridge — after more than three years of litigation — 
is not material to whether or not Nacino had a reasonable basis to believe he had been discriminated against in violation of HRS Chapter 378 at the time he filed the Discrimination Lawsuit (one 
month before his employment was terminated). The trier of fact 
must decide whether — under the circumstances that existed when 
the complaint in the Discrimination Lawsuit was filed — Nacino 
had a reasonable basis to believe he had been discriminated 
against in violation of HRS Chapter 378. 
The Motion for Reconsideration presents no point of law 
or fact we overlooked or misapprehended. See Rule 40(b), Hawai# i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED 
that the Motion for Reconsideration is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, October 17, 2022.
