Defendant-Appellant Association of Apartment Owners of 
Elima Lani Condominiums (the AOAO
) appeals from the November 22, 
2019 Judgment (Foreclosure Judgment), entered by the Circuit 
Court of the Third Circuit (Circuit Court)  in favor of 
Plaintiff-Appellee U.S. Bank National Association as Trustee for 
GSAA Home Equity Trust 2006-9 Asset-Backed Certificates Series 2006-9 (USBNA) and against self-represented Defendant-Appellee 
Dana C. Wynn, also known as Dana Cheryl Wynn (Wynn), the AOAO, 
and Defendant-Appellee Waikoloa Village Association (WVA). The 
AOAO also challenges the Circuit Court's November 22, 2019 1/ 
1/ The Honorable Robert D.S. Kim presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting 
Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and/or Default Judgment Against All Defendants and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure (Foreclosure Decree). For the reasons explained 
below, we affirm. 
On May 1, 2018, USBNA filed a Complaint for Mortgage 
Foreclosure (Complaint) against Wynn, the AOAO, and WVA regarding 
the subject property (Property). The AOAO answered the 
Complaint; Wynn and WVA did not. Wynn and WVA's defaults were 
entered on July 16, 2018. 
Prior to the filing of the Complaint, the AOAO 
conducted a nonjudicial foreclosure of its lien on the Property. On May 27, 2014, the AOAO recorded an affidavit of nonjudicial foreclosure under power of sale in the State of Hawaii Bureau of Conveyances (Bureau).  On May 28, 2014, a Quitclaim Deed 
transferring title to the Property to the AOAO was recorded in 
the Bureau. The Quitclaim Deed stated that it was "subject . . . to all encumbrances of record[.]" 
On October 23, 2018, USBNA filed a motion for summary 
judgment and/or default judgment against all defendants and for an interlocutory decree of foreclosure. The AOAO filed a limited memorandum in opposition. The AOAO contended that as the owner of the Property, it should continue to retain possession of the Property and collect rental proceeds "until completion of the current foreclosure under [Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)] 
ยง 514B-146(b)." The AOAO also reserved its right to collect a 
six-month special assessment under HRS ยง 514B-146(j), (k), and (l). 
On November 22, 2019, the Circuit Court granted USBNA's 
motion and entered the Foreclosure Decree. The Circuit Court appointed a commissioner, authorizing and directing him, inter alia: "to take possession and control of the Property, including but not limited to collecting rental payments and to sell the Property at a public auction . . . [,]" subject to confirmation by the Circuit Court. The Foreclosure Judgment was entered the same day. The AOAO filed a timely notice of appeal. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
 The AOAO raises two points of error: 
1. "The [C]ircuit [C]ourt committed reversible error 
when it purportedly vested the Commissioner with and divested the [AOAO] of equitable and legal title to the Property owned by the [AOAO]"; and 
2.
 "The [C]ircuit [C]ourt committed reversible error 
when it agreed with [USBNA] that the right to possess and collect rental income from the Property was within the Commissioner's discretion upon the entry of the [Foreclosure Decree], and ordered the Commissioner 'to take possession and control of the Property' owned by the [AOAO], including the collection and retention of rents." 
The AOAO contends that the Circuit Court erred in 
vesting the Commissioner with equitable and legal title to the Property by way of the Foreclosure Decree, which authorized and directed the Commissioner "to take possession and control of the Property, including but not limited to collecting rental payments[.]" However, the Foreclosure Decree does not purport to vest title in the Property to the Commissioner, and the AOAO does not explain how the quoted language accomplished that alleged result. 
Moreover, the Circuit Court did not err or abuse its 
discretion in ordering the Commissioner to take possession and control of the Property, including the collection of rents, and to sell the Property at public auction. The AOAO's title to the Property was subject to USBNA's mortgage lien, and a judgment of foreclosure is a final determination of a foreclosed party's ownership interest in the subject property. In other words, AOAO's ownership rights in the Property were foreclosed when the Foreclosure Judgment was entered, even though further proceedings were necessary to enforce and otherwise effectuate the Foreclosure Decree and the Foreclosure Judgment.
