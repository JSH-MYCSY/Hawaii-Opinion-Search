APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
MEMORANDUM OPINION 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and Nakasone, JJ.) 
  In this consolidated appeal,1 Defendants-Appellants 
Dennis Duane DeShaw ( DeShaw) and Susan Kay Broer-DeShaw ( Broer-
DeShaw) (collectively, DeShaws) appeal in CAAP-19-0000865 
(Foreclosure Appeal ) from the: (1) December 11, 2019 "Findings 
of Fact and Conclusions of Law [( FOFs/COLs )]; Order Granting 
Plaintiff's Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment and for 
Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure filed November 14, 2018" (Foreclosure Decree ), and (2) December 11, 2019 Judgment 
(Foreclosure Judgment ); and appeal in CAAP-22-0000408 ( Fees 
Appeal) from the May 23, 2022 "Findings of Fact and Conclusions 
of Law; Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Attorney's Fees and Costs and Additional Amounts Owed" ( Fees Order ). The 2
1 We consolidated CAAP-19-0000865 and CAAP-22-0000408 by an Order
of Consolidation filed on March 28, 2023. 
2 Although it appears that the Notice of Appeal and Reply Brief
were submitted by both DeShaw and Broer-DeShaw, only Broer-DeShaw submitted
the Opening Brief and Supplemental Brief in the Foreclosure Appeal and
opposed the Foreclosure Decree below. To the extent DeShaw raises any
arguments in the Foreclosure Appeal, they are waived. See Williams v. Aona, 
121 Hawai ‘i 1, 8, 210 P.3d 501, 508 (2009) ("As a general rule, if a party
does not raise an argument at trial, that argument will be deemed to have
been waived on appeal; this rule applies in both criminal and civil cases."

appeal were deemed waived). We thus refer to Broer-DeShaw only in ourdiscussion of the Foreclosure Appeal. Broer-DeShaw was self-represented up
until briefing was completed in 2020, and thereafter retained counsel, who
appeared in the Foreclosure Appeal on November 23, 2021 and filed theMarch 29, 2022 Supplemental Brief.

 In the Foreclosure Appeal, Broer-DeShaw raises the

the Note at Any Time, because the Endorsements on the NoteConvey Nothing to [BONYM].

3 The Honorable Jeannette H. Castagnetti entered the Foreclosure
Decree and Foreclosure Judgment in the Foreclosure Appeal. The Honorable 
Dean E. Ochiai entered the Fees Order in the Fees Appeal. 
4 Broer-DeShaw's POEs do not comply with Hawai ‘i Rules of Appellate
Procedure ( HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4) in multiple respects. We have numbered Broer-
DeShaws' POEs per the rule, and we have also consolidated and reorganizedthem for clarity in our discussion infra. While the POEs do not contain "where in the record the alleged error was objected to or the manner in whichthe alleged error was brought to the attention of the court or agency[,]"
HRAP Rule 28(b)(4)(iii), we address them to the extent the contentions can be
discerned. See Erum v. Llego, 147 Hawai ‘i 368, 380-81, 465 P.3d 815, 827-28 
(2020) (affording liberal review to pleadings by self-represented parties to
promote access to justice).

[9]. The Circuit Court's Judgment Amount is Based on
Evidence that it Held to be Inadmissible. 
In the Fees Appeal,5 the DeShaws contend that the 
Circuit Court lacked jurisdiction to enter the Fees Order, which 
awarded fees and additional amounts to BONYM after a notice of appeal had been filed from the April 12, 2022 order and judgment confirming the sale of the property in CAAP-22-0000266 (Confirmation Appeal ). 
We hold in the Foreclosure Appeal that Broer-DeShaw's 
challenges to the Foreclosure Decree are not moot under the collateral consequences exception despite the sale of the property; but the challenges are nevertheless without merit. We hold in the Fees Appeal that the Circuit Court retained jurisdiction to enter the Fees Order even after the Confirmation Appeal was filed, where the Fees Order determined the final 
amounts owed to BONYM incidental to the enforcement of the 
Foreclosure Decree and distributed the proceeds of the sale. We thus affirm. 
I. BACKGROUND 
  On September 27, 2016, BONYM filed a Verified 
Complaint to Foreclose Mortgage ( Complaint ), alleging that the 
DeShaws defaulted on a promissory note ( Note) secured by a 
mortgage ( Mortgage ) on real property on Ka ‘aholo Street, Waipahu, 
Hawai
‘i 96797 ( Subject Property ).  
On May 9, 2018, Broer-DeShaw filed an Answer and 
Counterclaim ( Counterclaim ) alleging wrongful foreclosure, 
5 The Opening Brief submitted in the Fees Appeal was filed by
counsel on behalf of both the DeShaws. Although the DeShaws did not
challenge the Fees Order below, we address their sole argument challengingthe Circuit Court's jurisdiction. See Bank of N.Y. Mellon v. Comito,
136 
Hawai ’i 532, 534, 364 P.3d 240, 242 (App. 2015) ("Questions regarding
subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any stage of a cause of action."
(quoting Lingle v. Haw. Gov't Emps. Ass'n, AFSCME, Local 152, AFL-CIO,

declaratory judgment, quiet title, and damages for unfair and 
deceptive trade practices.6 
On November 14, 2018, BONYM filed a "Renewed Motion 
for Summary Judgment and for Interlocutory Decree of 
Foreclosure" ( Renewed MSJ ).7 Attached was a declaration by Brian 
Nwabara ( Nwabara) as an "employe[e]" and "custodian" of Bayview 
Loan Servicing, LLC ( Bayview), "the authorized loan servicing 
agent for BONYM"; and a declaration by BONYM's counsel, 
declaring that BONYM was in possession of the Note at the time the foreclosure action was commenced. Also attached were a copy 
of the Note, an acknowledgement document reflecting that BONYM's 
counsel received possession of the Note on September 16, 2016, a June 4, 2015 Notice of Default letter mailed to the DeShaws at the Subject Property address, copies of the records that Nwabara relied on and the account and payment history of the loan, a copy of the Mortgage, and a copy of a 2011 "Assignment of Mortgage" ( First Assignment ) and 2015 "Assignment of Mortgage" 
(Second Assignment ). 
On March 27, 2019, Broer-DeShaw filed a "Response in 
Opposition to [BONYM]'s Renewed [MSJ]" ( Opposition ), arguing, 
among other things, that BONYM "may not exist"; Nwabara's declaration was "hearsay under U.S. Bank v. Mattos "; the 
endorsement on the Note did not "convey anything to" BONYM; 
6 To date, the Counterclaim has not been adjudicated by the Circuit
Court. The Counterclaim was referenced in the background of the DeShaws'
Amended Opening Brief in CAAP-19-0000865, but no argument was made regardingit. Both parties do address the Counterclaim in their responses filed onAugust 10, 2023, pursuant to this court's July 11, 2023 order directing theparties to address why the Foreclosure Appeal should not be dismissed for
mootness due to sale of the Subject Property to a bona fide purchaser. The 
Counterclaim is discussed infra. 
7 BONYM's first motion for summary judgment filed December 29,
2017, was denied without prejudice following a March 14, 2018 hearing. The 
Circuit Court denied the motion because, among other things, the declaration
discussed a "prior unidentified servicer on the mortgage as containingrecords relied upon by" BONYM, and due to "procedural problems."

there was "no evidence that the Notice of Default was mailed" to 
the DeShaws; the First Assignment was from "a party with no interest in the Note," was a "legal nullity," and "forged"; "a Note cannot be conveyed in a separate document"; the Second 
Assignment did not "convey the Note"; and there was "no evidence 
of payment" for the Note. 
On March 29, 2019, BONYM filed a "Reply in Support of 
its Renewed [MSJ]" ( Reply). Attached to the Reply were 
declarations by BONYM's counsel of record, Aldridge Pite, LLP, and Aldridge Pite, LLP's Compliance Manager, Valerie Lacava 
(Lacava), declaring that Aldrige Pite, LLP received the Note on 
September 16, 2016. 
On April 3, 2019, a hearing on the Renewed MSJ was 
held.
8 
On December 11, 2019, the Circuit Court granted the 
Renewed MSJ and filed its Foreclosure Decree and Foreclosure 
Judgment. The Foreclosure Decree determined the amount due and 
owing to BONYM from the DeShaws as of July 8, 2018;9 and 
pertinent to the Fees Appeal, the decree awarded per diem 
interest on the Note "from and after July 8, 2018", along with other fees, expenses and amounts that the Circuit Court "shall subsequently determine[.]"

exhibits attached in support of BONYM's Renewed MSJ, calculating the amount
due and owing as of July 8, 2018.

  On January 26, 2022, BONYM filed a "Renewed Motion for 
Confirmation of Foreclosure Sale, Allowance of Costs, 
Commissions and Fees, Distribution of Proceeds, Directing 
Conveyance and for Writ of Possession/Ejectments" ( Renewed

granted at a March 4, 2022 hearing.  
  On March 17, 2022, BONYM filed a "Motion for 
Attorney's Fees and Costs and Additional Amounts Owed" ( Motion

  On April 12, 2022, the Circuit Court filed its "Order

The Confirmation Order 
named Zhuping Ye ( Ye) as the purchaser of the Subject Property,

Appeal.14 
On April 13, 2022, the day after the Confirmation 
Appeal had been filed, the Circuit Court heard BONYM's Motion 
for Fees, and orally granted the motion. 
On May 23, 2022, while the Foreclosure Appeal and 
Confirmation Appeal were pending, the Circuit Court filed the 
Fees Order. The Fees Order awarded $201,345.73, consisting of, among other things, attorney's fees, costs, and additional interest on the Note from "July 8, 2018, through March 16, 2022,"
15 in addition to the $609,002.91 previously awarded to 
BONYM from the sale proceeds. 
On June 22, 2022, the DeShaws appealed from the Fees 
Order, generating the Fees Appeal. 
On October 21, 2022, BONYM filed a motion to dismiss 
the Confirmation Appeal, CAAP-22-0000266, arguing that the issues raised by the DeShaws in the appeal were moot because the 
Subject Property had been sold to Ye, a third-party good-faith 
purchaser who was not a party to the action. The motion 
13 HRCP Rule 54(b) provides that a court may enter a final judgment
as to fewer than all claims, "only upon an express determination that there
is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of
judgment." 
14 HRS § 667-51(a)(2) provides that a judgment certified under HRCP
Rule 54(b) entered on an order confirming sale is final and appealable. 
15 The March 16, 2022 date is as of the time the Motion for Fees was
filed on March 17, 2022.

attached a recorded quitclaim deed reflecting the new owner of 
the Subject Property. The DeShaws opposed the motion. 
Also on October 21, 2022, BONYM filed a motion to 
dismiss the Fees Appeal in CAAP-22-0000408, raising the same 
argument that the appeal was moot due to the sale of the Subject 
Property to a third-party good-faith purchaser; and because the DeShaws had not opposed the Fees Order below. The DeShaws opposed the motion. 
On November 4, 2022, this court granted dismissal of 
the Confirmation Appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction 
because the Subject Property had been "sold to a bona fide 
purchaser" ;
16 and denied dismissal of the Fees Appeal because we 
did not lack jurisdiction over the Fees Appeal based on mootness.
17 
On July 11, 2023, we issued an Order to Show Cause as 
to why the Foreclosure Appeal should not be dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction due to mootness, based on the 
dismissal of the Confirmation Appeal. The parties filed 
responses on August 10, 2023. Broer-DeShaw, now represented by counsel, argued that dismissal of the Foreclosure Appeal "will have an undue preclusive effect upon the DeShaws' pending claims in their wrongful foreclosure counterclaim, barring their ability to recover damages despite being victims of a wrongful 
mortgage foreclosure resulting in the unlawful loss of their 
home." Broer-DeShaw cited Bank of Am., N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 
143 Hawai‘ i 249, 264, 428 P.3d 761, 776 (2018), which held that 
16 This court relied on, inter alia , Bank of New York Mellon v. 
R. Onaga, Inc., 140 Hawai ’i 358, 370, 400 P.3d 559, 570 (2017) ("If a stay is
not obtained and the property is sold to a bona fide purchaser, the appeal
should be dismissed as moot because no effective relief can be granted."). 
17 The DeShaws did not seek certiorari review of the dismissal of 
the Confirmation Appeal. 
10  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawai‘i law permitted a mortgagor to maintain a cause of action 
for wrongful foreclosure based on the underlying facts of the 
foreclosure case; and argued that "'a mortgagor should be able 
to assert a counterclaim'" on those facts, but this did "'not 
mean a mortgagor must assert the wrongful foreclosure claim as a compulsory counterclaim.'" 
Broer-DeShaw asserted that the 
Counterclaim was "based upon the exact same live controversy that is at issue in this appeal."  Broer-DeShaw urged that 
"[e]ven if title cannot be recovered, under the counterclaim the issue of damages remains[,]" and that the Foreclosure Appeal is 
"not moot because effective relief can be afforded in the form 
of damages."  
BONYM argued that the Foreclosure Appeal is moot for 
the same reasons this court dismissed the Confirmation 
Appeal.18 
With regard to the Counterclaim, BONYM argued that the Counterclaim was not the subject of any of the three appeals 
(Foreclosure Appeal, Confirmation Appeal, Fees Appeal); the 
Counterclaim had "not been directly adjudicated by the Circuit Court"; and no order or judgment had been entered on the Counterclaim. BONYM, however, expressly acknowledged that by entering the Foreclosure Decree, "the Circuit Court did indirectly find that [DeShaws'] Counterclaim lacks merit" by "finding that BONYM had a valid Mortgage encumbering the 
Property and [BONYM] was entitled to foreclose on the same." 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A. Mootness 
"It is axiomatic that mootness is an issue of subject 
matter jurisdiction. 'Whether a court possesses subject matter 
jurisdiction is a question of law reviewable de novo.'" 
18 In its response, BONYM attached and incorporated its previous
argument from the October 21, 2022 motion to dismiss the Confirmation Order
Appeal, CAAP-22-0000266, which this court granted on November 4, 2022.

[S]ummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on
file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that thereis no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movingparty is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. 
The burden is on the party moving for summary
judgment (moving party) to show the absence of any genuineissue as to all material facts, which, under applicableprinciples of substantive law, entitles the moving party to
judgment as a matter of law.

III. DISCUSSION 
A. While the Foreclosure Appeal is moot as to the
relief requested, Broer-DeShaw's challenges to theForeclosure Decree are intertwined with the 
unresolved Counterclaim, and are not moot. 
 
 Here, the relief Broer-Deshaw  requests in the Amended 
Opening Brief is for this court to "reverse" the Circuit Court's 
grant of summary judgment and the Foreclosure Decree, and "remand the matter" back to the Circuit Court for a "fair trial."  Broer-DeShaw argues that "then the true owner of the 
Note and the [M]ortgage probably would be compelled to reveal itself, and [Broer-DeShaw] could apply to that entity for a modification and reinstatement of her loan."  Broer-Deshaw, 
however, did not obtain a stay of the proceeding by posting a bond, and the Subject Property has been sold to a bona fide 
purchaser. See Onaga, 140 
Hawai ‘i at 368-69, 400 P.3d at 569-70 
(holding that because the property was sold to a bona fide 
purchaser and appellant did not post a bond to stay the Under Hawai ‘i law, mootness is an issue of 
justiciability . State v. Hewitt, 153 Hawai ‘
i 33, 42, 526 P.3d 
558, 567 (2023). A case is moot "where events subsequent to the judgment of the trial court have so affected the relations between the parties that the two conditions for justiciability relevant on appeal—adverse interest and effective remedy—have 
been compromised." Lethem, 119 Hawai ‘i at 5, 193 P.3d at 843

    We do not dismiss the Foreclosure Appeal, however,

mootness is obviously unfair" and vacating the subject orders, 
"which are 'unreviewable because of mootness, from spawning any legal consequences'" (quoting Aircall of Haw., Inc. v. Home Properties, Inc., 6 Haw. App. 593, 595-96, 733 P.2d 1231, 1232-

proceedings, the appeal requesting relief of "a decision on the merits of the foreclosure decree, as well as new foreclosure proceedings" was moot). Thus, Broer-DeShaw's appeal of the merits of the Foreclosure Decree and Judgment would ordinarily 
be moot. See id.; Cmty. Ass'ns of Hualalai, Inc., 150 Hawai ‘i
 at 
253, 500 P.3d at 438. 
Here, the parties do not dispute that the allegations 
in the Counterclaim are intertwined with the FOFs/COLs in the 
Foreclosure Decree. Broer-DeShaw argued, and BONYM 
acknowledged, that the Foreclosure Decree contained findings regarding the validity of the mortgage and BONYM's entitlement to foreclose, which would impact the same issues raised in the Counterclaim. If the Foreclosure Decree was unreviewable on 
appeal due to mootness, there is a reasonable possibility that 
14  
 
  
 
 
  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the Decree would "spawn[] . . . legal consequences" on the same 
issues in the unresolved, pending Counterclaim. See McCabe, 
98 Hawai ‘i at 121, 43 P.3d at 258. "To invoke successfully the 
collateral consequences doctrine, the litigant must show that 
there is a reasonable possibility that prejudicial collateral 
consequences will occur."

846 (emphases omitted) (quoting Putman v. Kennedy, 900 A.2d

We conclude that this standard has 
been met here, and we thus review the appeal of the Foreclosure 
Decree on the merits, under the collateral consequences 
exception. 
B. In the Foreclosure Appeal, Broer-DeShaw's
challenges to the Foreclosure Decree are without
merit. 
1. The contention in POE 1 that the Circuit Court failed to "explain its findings" is without
merit. 
Broer-DeShaw argues that the Foreclosure Decree did 
not address any of Broer-DeShaw's arguments, and that the 
Circuit Court "just signed whatever proposed order [BONYM] submitted to it[.]" The Circuit Court was not required to make 
findings of fact and conclusions of law in disposing of the 
Renewed MSJ. See HRCP Rule 52(a) ("Findings of fact and conclusions of law are unnecessary on decisions of motions under Rules 12 or 56 . . . ."). Nevertheless, the Foreclosure Decree contains FOFs/COLs supporting the Circuit Court's grant of the MSJ, none of which are specifically challenged by Broer-DeShaw. This argument is without merit. 
15  
 
  
 
    
 
   
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2. Broer-DeShaw's contention in POE 2 that BONYM 
did not "own[] the Note" because BONYM "does
not exist" is without merit. 
Broer-DeShaw argues that BONYM does not own the Note 
because BONYM is "fictional." 
In support of this contention, 
Broer-DeShaw points to an unauthenticated exhibit attached to 
Broer-DeShaw's declaration to the opposition to the Renewed MSJ below. Broer-DeShaw declared that the exhibit was a printout from the Securities and Exchange Commission, reflecting search results for what Broer-DeShaw claimed was a "list of all 34 registered MBS trusts whose names begin with 'CWALT[,]'" with 
none being BONYM.
19 The exhibit contained no seal or 
certification, and lacked the authentication required for public 
records admissibility. See Hawaii Rules of Evidence ( HRE) Rules 
90120 and 902.21 Broer-DeShaw's argument that BONYM "seems not to 
exist clearly raises a genuine issue of material fact" was not 
19 Broer-DeShaw also claims that "[a]t the hearing on the [MSJ], the
Circuits [sic] Court ordered . . . counsel for [BONYM], 'to correct the case
caption.'" The record on appeal does not contain the transcripts of theMarch 14, 2018 or April 3, 2019 hearings on the MSJ or Renewed MSJ, and we do
not address this claim. See HRAP Rule 10(1)(A) ("When an appellant desires
to raise any point on appeal that requires consideration of the oralproceedings before the court appealed from, the appellant shall file . . .within 10 days after filing the notice of appeal, a request or requests to
prepare a reporter's transcript."); Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai ‘i 
225, 230, 909 P.2d 553, 558 (1995) ("The burden is upon appellant in an
appeal to show error by reference to matters in the record, and he or she has
the responsibility of providing an adequate transcript." (brackets omitted)(quoting Union Bldg. Materials Corp. v. The Kakaako Corp., 5 Haw. App. 146,151, 682 P.2d 82, 87 (1984))). 
20 HRE Rule 901, entitled "Requirement of authentication or
identification," states that "authentication or identification" is a"condition precedent to admissibility," which can be satisfied by "[e]videncethat a writing authorized by law to be recorded or filed and in fact recordedor filed in a public office, or a purported public record, report, statement,
or data compilation, in any form, is from the public office where items of
this nature are kept." 
21 HRE Rule 902, entitled "Self-authentication," states that
"[e]xtrinsic evidence of authenticity as a condition precedent to
admissibility is not required with respect to" "[a] document bearing a seal
purporting to be that of . . . [an] agency thereof, and a signaturepurporting to be an attestation or execution." 
16  
 
   
 
 
 
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
supported by admissible evidence under HRCP Rule 56(e). See
HRCP Rule 56(e) ("When a motion for summary judgment is made and 
supported as provided in this rule, an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the adverse party's 
pleading, but the adverse party's response, by affidavits or as 
otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial."). 
The Circuit Court stated in its FOFs/COLs in the 
Foreclosure Decree that BONYM "is, and at all times relevant was, a New York company, authorized to do business in the State 
of Hawaii." Broer-DeShaw has not pointed to admissible evidence 
in the record creating a genuine factual dispute regarding BONYM's existence, and this contention is without merit. 
3. POEs 3, 6, and 7 challenging the indorsements
on the Note and that BONYM "paid nothing" for
the Note, lack merit. 
Broer-DeShaw contends that because the Note's three 
endorsements are "undated," "none of them conveys [sic] anything 
to [BONYM]"; BONYM's name is not on the Note; the "chain of 
title . . . convey[ed] nothing to [BONYM]"; BONYM "paid nothing for the Note"; and the Circuit Court "erred in concluding that a plaintiff that pays nothing for a loan is entitled to take the collateral that secures the loan."
22 We construe these arguments 
as a challenge to BONYM's standing to enforce the Note. 
  
To establish standing to bring a foreclosure action, a 
foreclosing plaintiff must prove its entitlement to enforce the note and mortgage at the commencement of the suit. Reyes-
Toledo, 139 
Hawai ‘i at 367, 390 P.3d at 1254. A "holder" of an 
instrument such as a note is a "[p]erson entitled to enforce" 
22 Broer-DeShaw does not cite to any authority in support of the
argument that BONYM was required to prove what it paid to acquire the Note.
This argument is without merit.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
it. Id. at 369, 390 P.3d at 1256; HRS § 490:3-301 (2008); HRS § 
490:1-201 (2008). A note may be negotiated or its possession may be transferred by special indorsement or blank indorsement by a holder. HRS § 490:3-201 (2008); HRS § 490:3-205 (2008). 
"When indorsed in blank, an instrument becomes payable to 
bearer." Reyes-Toledo, 139 
Hawai ‘i at 370, 390 P.3d at 1257 
(citing HRS § 490:3-205(b)). 
A "bearer" is a person or entity 
in possession of a note that is "payable to bearer or indorsed-
in-blank." HRS § 490:1-201. 
Here, BONYM submitted admissible evidence establishing 
that it had been in possession of the original, indorsed-in-blank Note before the foreclosure action was commenced. Lacava, the Compliance Manager for BONYM's counsel, submitted a declaration with the Reply to the Renewed MSJ, confirming receipt and review of the original Note on September 16, 2016, before the Complaint was filed on September 27, 2016. Lacava's 
attached exhibits included a Bailee Letter she signed on 
September 16, 2016, acknowledging receipt of the original Note with indorsements, from Bayview; and a copy of her September 16, 2016 email to BONYM's counsel indicating receipt of the original loan documents. BONYM's evidence sufficiently established its standing to enforce the Note under Reyes-Toledo. The Circuit Court's conclusion that BONYM "is the holder of the Note" and 
"was the holder of the Note at the time this foreclosure action 
was commenced" was correct, and Broer-DeShaw's contentions in this regard are without merit. 
4. Broer-DeShaw's challenges to the assignments of
the Mortgage in POEs 4 and 5 lack merit. 
Broer-DeShaw argues that BONYM is not the "owner" of 
the Note because the First Assignment was from MERS and that 
"MERS never had any interest in the Note," and "a mortgage without its Note is a legal nullity"; the assignment was 
18  
 
   
  
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"forged" because it was signed by an "employee of Bank of 
America, not an employee of MERS";23 and that a "Negotiable 
Instrument (like a Note) cannot be conveyed in a separate document." Broer-DeShaw further claims that the Second 
Assignment "does not even attempt to convey any interest in the 
Note[,]" as it "attempts to convey only an interest in the Mortgage[.]" 
Broer-DeShaw's arguments are difficult to discern. 
We 
have already affirmed supra the Circuit Court's conclusion that BONYM had standing to enforce the Note. Because "the security 
follows the debt," a mortgage may only be enforced by the person 
or entity entitled to enforce the Note. Reyes-Toledo, 
139 
Hawai ‘i at 371 n.17, 390 P.3d at 1258 n.17 ("A mortgage may 
be enforced only by, or in behalf of, a person who is entitled 
to enforce the obligation the mortgage secures." (citing Restatement (Third) of Property (Mortgages) § 5.4(c) (1997))). 
Here, the record reflects that the Mortgage stated: 
"MERS is a separate corporation that is acting solely as a nominee for Lender [(First Magnus Financial Corporation)] and Lender's successors and assigns." 
The Mortgage also provided: 
"The Note or a partial interest in the Note (together with this [Mortgage]) can be sold one or more times without prior notice to Borrower." Thus, MERS had the authority under the Mortgage 
to execute the First Assignment through its Assistant Secretary. 
The Circuit Court pertinently determined: 
5. The Mortgage was assigned by MERS to The Bank of New
York Mellon fka The Bank of New York, as Trustee for the
Certificateholders CWALT, Inc., Alternative Loan Trust
2006-32CB, Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2006-32CB (BONYM CWALT ) pursuant to an Assignment of Mortgage
("First Assignment") recorded on September 2, 2011, in theBureau of Conveyances of the State of Hawaii as Document
No. 2011-141243. The Mortgage was then assigned to [BONYM] 
23 The "forgery" claim appears to lack basis. The First Assignment
was signed by MERS, Inc., by "Christopher Herrera, Assistant Secretary." 
19  
 
  
 
  
 
  
  
 
 
 
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
pursuant to an Assignment of Mortgage ("Second Assignment")
recorded on November 24, 2015, in the Bureau of Conveyances
of the State of Hawaii as Document No. A-58060922. 
Broer-DeShaw presents no discernible challenge to the Circuit 
Court's conclusion regarding the assignments. 
5. Broer-DeShaw's contention in POE 8 that there 
was no evidence that the Notice of Default "was 
mailed" to them is without merit. 
Broer-DeShaw contends that the Notice of Default was 
not sent to them, and that the pertinent exhibit attached to 
BONYM's Renewed MSJ "shows the cover of an envelope addressed to [the DeShaws], but it is not postmarked and appears never to have been sent." Broer-DeShaw claims there was no "tracking number," "certificate of mailing," or "signature of the 
[DeShaws]." 
The Note pertinently provides: 
7. GIVING OF NOTICES 
Unless applicable law requires a different method,
any notice that must be given to me [(the DeShaws)] under
this Note will be given by delivering it or by mailing itby first class mail to me at the Property Address above orat a different address if I give the Note Holder a noticeof that different address. 
(Emphasis added.) The Mortgage also states, "Any notice to 
Borrower [(the DeShaws)] in connection with this Security Instrument shall be deemed to have been given to Borrower when mailed by first class mail or when actually delivered to Borrower's notice address if sent by other means." (Emphasis added.) 
Here, the Circuit Court concluded that "[d]ue notice 
has been given to DeShaws." The record reflects that Exhibit D attached to BONYM's Renewed MSJ was a copy of a June 4, 2015 Notice of Default Letter, addressed to the DeShaws at the Subject Property address, and sent via "First-Class Mail." Broer-DeShaw's contention is without merit. 
20  
 
  
  
  
  
 
   
 
  
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
6. As to POE 9, the Circuit Court did not
erroneously determine the amount owed based on
inadmissible evidence. 
Broer-DeShaw argues in the Amended Opening Brief that 
Nwabara's declaration for Bayview as the "new" loan servicer 
contained inadmissible hearsay testimony about "past servicers 
and past amounts," because the declaration contained "no personal knowledge of prior servicers procedures and records and no personal knowledge of all amounts paid by [Broer-DeShaw] in the past" and "flunks the Mattos test."
24 In her Supplemental 
Brief,25 Broer-DeShaw also asserts that Nwabara's declaration did 
not "satisfy[ ] the business records exception to the hearsay rule or the incorporated records doctrine with respect to the loan payment history documents[,]" and thus the records of the prior loan services were inadmissible under Verhagen. BONYM maintains that Nwabara's declaration was compliant with Mattos and Verhagen, and was admissible. We conclude that Nwabara's declaration was admissible, and Broer-DeShaw's challenge lacks 
merit. 
"[A] declaration in support of a summary judgment 
motion must be based on personal knowledge, contain facts that 
would be admissible in evidence, and show that the declarant is competent to testify as to the matters contained within the 
declaration." Mattos
, 140 Hawai ‘i at 30, 398 P.3d at 619 . In 
24 In U.S. Bank N.A. v. Mattos, the supreme court held that "a
declaration in support of a summary judgment motion must be based on personal
knowledge, contain facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show that
the declarant is competent to testify as to the matters contained within the
declaration." 140 Hawai ‘i 26, 30, 398 P.3d 615, 619 (2017). 
25 On March 15, 2022, this court filed an Order for Supplemental
Briefing, ordering the parties to submit supplemental briefing in light of
the supreme court's opinion in U.S. Bank Tr., N.A., as Tr. for LSF9 Master
Participation Tr. v. Verhagen, 149 Hawai ‘i 315, 489 P.3d 419 (2021). On March 
29, 2022, both BONYM and Broer-DeShaw through counsel, filed Supplemental
Briefs. 
21  
 
  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Mattos, the supreme court held that loan documents were not 
admissible through the "Contract Management Coordinator of OCWEN Loan Servicing, LLC [( Ocwen)], the servicer of U.S. Bank N.A. 
[(U.S. Bank )]," where the declaration did not state that the 
declarant was a "custodian of records for either U.S. Bank or Ocwen." Id. at 30-32, 398 P.3d at 619-21. Nwabara's 
declaration does not contain a similar infirmity, because Nwabara's declaration stated that he was a custodian of records for the loan servicer, Bayview; was "familiar with Bayview's books and records regarding the Loan, including Bayview's 
servicing records and copies of the applicable loan documents"; 
and was familiar with "the manner in which Bayview maintain[ed] its books and records, including computer records relating to the servicing of the Loan." Nwabara testified that Bayview "maintain[ed] all the day to day loan documents, records and accounting of payments on the Loan being foreclosed in this action." 
In Verhagen, the supreme court explained that to 
establish the business records exception to the hearsay rule under the incorporated records doctrine, "records received from another business and incorporated into the receiving business' records may in some circumstances be regarded as 'created' by 
the receiving business." 
149 Hawai ‘i at 325, 489 P.3d at 429 
(quoting Behrendt, 142 Hawai ‘i at 45, 414 P.3d at 97). Thus, 
"when a record is treated as 'created' by the receiving 
business, a person is qualified to authenticate it if the person has 'enough familiarity with the record-keeping system of the business that "created" the record,' i.e., the receiving or incorporating business." 
Id.Three conditions are required to 
treat an incorporated record as "created" by the receiving business: 
"[1] the documents were incorporated and kept in the 
22  
 
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
normal course of business, [2] that the incorporating business 
typically relies upon the accuracy of the contents of the documents, and [3] the circumstances otherwise indicate the trustworthiness of the document." Id. (alterations in original) 
(quoting Behrendt, 142 Hawai ‘i at 45, 414 P.3d at 97). In 
Verhagen, the supreme court concluded that these three 
conditions were satisfied, where there was testimony that "JPMorgan Chase's [(the prior loan servicer)] records were incorporated into Caliber's [(the current loan servicer)] own and kept and maintained by Caliber in the ordinary course of its 
business"; that "Caliber used and relied on the incorporated 
records in the regular course of its loan servicing business"; and that the incorporated records went through a "due diligence phase" and were "reviewed" prior to being incorporated. Id. at 
430-31, 489 P.3d at 326-27. 
Similar to the declaration deemed sufficient in 
Verhagen, Nwabara testified that "Bayview's records include[d] and incorporate[d] records for the Loan obtained from First Magnus Financial Corporation and Countrywide [(the prior loan servicers)]"; the documents obtained from the prior servicers were "kept and maintained by Bayview in the ordinary course of its business" and "relied upon by Bayview"; the documents went through a "due diligence phase," consisting of a "review of 
[the] hard copy documents," including the "payment history," and 
the "accounting of other fees, costs, and expenses charged to the Loan by Prior Servicer." We conclude that Nwabara's declaration as Bayview's custodian of records satisfied the three criteria under the incorporated records doctrine to incorporate the records of the prior loan servicers. The loan 
payment history documents were thus admissible under the HRE 
Rule 803(b)(6) business records exception to the hearsay rule, 
23  
 
  
  
 
 
   
 
  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and Broer-DeShaw's challenge to the determination of the amount 
owed is without merit. See id.; Mattos, 140 Hawai ‘i at 30-32, 
398 P.3d at 619-21. 
B. In the Fees Appeal, the Circuit Court retained
jurisdiction to enter the Fees Order. 
The DeShaws' sole challenge in the Fees Appeal, is 
that the Circuit Court "lacked jurisdiction to alter or amend 
its prior order and judgment due to the DeShaw's [sic] filing of a notice of appeal on April 12, 2022" in the Confirmation Order Appeal.  
 The DeShaws argue that, while the Circuit Court may 
retain jurisdiction to determine matters collateral or incidental to the judgment, the Fees Order "was not a matter that was collateral to or incedental [sic] to the [Confirmation 
Judgment] the DeShaws appealed from[.]"  The DeShaws assert that 
"[i]nstead, the issue of distribution of confirmation sale 
proceeds was the exact issue adjudicated by" the Confirmation Order and Confirmation Judgment,  and thus, the filing of the 
2726 
26 The DeShaws did not file an opposition to the motion, and the
Circuit Court noted such in the Fees Order. 
27 This is not an accurate characterization of the Confirmation 
Order and Confirmation Judgment. Contrary to the DeShaws' claim, the "issue
of distribution of confirmation sale proceeds" was not "the exact issueadjudicated" in the Confirmation Order and Confirmation Judgment. The 
Confirmation Order directed payment of the previously ordered $609,002.91
amount, the Commissioner's fees and costs, and deferred the issue ofdistribution of the proceeds, stating that "excess sale proceeds" would bedeposited with the court "until and unless" the Circuit Court gave furtherinstruction "as to how any excess sale proceeds should be distributed
pursuant to [HRS] § 667-3." 
In the DeShaws' appeal from the Confirmation Order that this
court dismissed, the DeShaws challenged a procedural aspect of the sale
itself, as follows: 
The Circuit Court abused its discretion in confirming theforeclosure sale where the procedure employed by theCommissioner, and in particular his publications notifyingpersons of open houses only the day of and after said open
houses occurred, was neither reasonable nor sufficient to
obtain the highest possible price for the real estate beingsold. 
24  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appeal "divested the Circuit Court of jurisdiction on the issues 
of confirmation of sale and distribution of proceeds." 
BONYM argues that the Circuit Court was not divested 
of jurisdiction to grant the Motion for Fees and Amounts because 
the motion was "ancillary" and "incidental" to the Foreclosure 
Decree and Confirmation Order.28 BONYM points out that the Fees 
Order did not "amount[] to an amendment of the Confirmation Order" because "both the Foreclosure Order and Confirmation Order establish that BONYM is entitled to collect attorneys' fees and costs, additional interest, and advances for real 
property taxes and insurance"; and the Fees Order "was necessary 
to establish the exact calculations of the amounts of interest and other fees and costs that BONYM was entitled to collect from the foreclosure sale proceeds." 
We conclude, under the record and circumstances of 
this case, that the Fees Order fully adjudicated matters "incident" to the enforcement of the Foreclosure Decree in this 
case, including the final amount owed to BONYM and the final 
distribution of the sale proceeds pursuant to HRS §§ 667-3
29 and 
The DeShaws raised no challenge to the "issue of distribution of
confirmation sale proceeds" in their Confirmation Appeal, despite theirsubsequent contention here that such distribution was the "exact issue"
adjudicated in the Confirmation Order.

for the distribution of foreclosure proceeds. It states:

notice of appeal, the trial court retains jurisdiction to determine matters collateral or incidental to the judgment, and may act in aid of the appeal." TSA Intern. Ltd. v. Shimizu
Corp., 92 Hawai ‘i 243, 265, 990 P.2d 713, 735 (1999) (citations

into two separately appealable parts: (1) the decree of

The second "separately appealable" part includes "all other orders," which include "[o]rders confirming sale, deficiency judgments, orders directing the

otherwise connected with (something else, usu[ally] of greater

Here, the Circuit Court did not determine the final 
amount due to BONYM until after the foreclosure sale was 
completed.32 The December 11, 2019 Foreclosure Decree partially 
determined the amount due and owing to BONYM as "$609,002.91" as 
of July 8, 2018, and also awarded items it left for subsequent determination. Thus, the Foreclosure Decree left "many matters . . . undetermined[,]" Sturkie, 2 Haw. App. at 146, 627 P.2d at 302, and specified that the Circuit Court would "subsequently 
determine" the amounts of the "interest, costs, expenses, late 
fees, other charges and attorneys' fees . . . at a subsequent hearing", with "all sums to be paid at the date of closing of the sale[.]" The Foreclosure Decree further ordered that these sums would be a valid "first lien" on the Subject Property "prior to all others." See HRS § 667-3 (providing that any "surplus after payment of the mortgage foreclosed, shall be 
applied pro tanto to the next junior mortgage or lien"). 
32 Establishing the amount owed on a mortgage is not one of the
elements of a foreclosure claim. See HawaiiUSA Fed. Credit Union v. Monalim,
147 Hawai ‘i 33, 49 n.22, 464 P.3d 821 n.22 (2020) (holding that HRS § 667-1.5,
which provides that the Circuit Court may assess the amount due in a
foreclosure action, "does not burden the foreclosing party with theobligation to prove the amount due on the mortgage before the foreclosure
sale because 'a deficiency judgment is rendered only after the sale of the
mortgaged property.'") (citing Bank of Honolulu, N.A. v. Anderson, 3 Haw.App. 545, 549, 654 P.2d 1370, 1374 (1982)). To prove entitlement toforeclosure, the lender must prove "the existence of an agreement, the termsof the agreement, a default by the mortgagor under the terms of the
agreement, and giving of the cancellation notice." Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai ‘i 
at 367, 390 P.3d at 1254 (citing Anderson, 3 Haw. App. at 551, 654 P.2d at
1375). In Anderson, this court explained that the lender "was not requiredto prove the exact amount owed under the Agreement until after theconfirmation of the foreclosure sale." Anderson, 3 Haw. App. at 550,654 P.2d at 1374. "The exact amounts of interest and other charges and
credits, if any, could be determined after the confirmation of the
foreclosure sale." Id. at 552, 654 P.2d at 1376.

The April 12, 2022 Confirmation Order did not contain 
the final determination on the additional amounts owed to BONYM. 
The Confirmation Order confirmed the sale of the Subject Property to Ye for $851,000.00; ordered payment of $13,419.79 
for the Commissioner's fees and costs "from the proceeds of the 
sale"; and ordered the Commissioner to pay BONYM $609,002.91 from the sale proceeds as the amount due and owing as of July 8, 2018. In addition, the Circuit Court found that "[t]he net sale proceeds will likely exceed the final total amount of [BONYM]'s judgment[,]" and ordered that: "[e]xcess sale proceeds, if any, 
shall be deposited with the Clerk of the Court until and unless 
the Court provides further instruction as to how any excess sale proceeds should be distributed, pursuant to [HRS] § 667-3." Finally, the Confirmation Order provided that "[c]losing of the sale . . . shall occur within thirty-five (35) days from the date of entry of this Order."
33 As to the undetermined 
additional amounts owed to BONYM, the Confirmation Order 
explicitly "reserve[d] jurisdiction to enter such future orders 
as may be necessary or appropriate to . . . any determination of any additional amounts due and owing to [BONYM], including attorney's fees/costs." Thus, the Confirmation Order continued to leave undetermined the amounts for the attorneys' fees, interest, and additional expenses, and specified that the 
Circuit Court would provide further instruction as to the 
distribution of excess sale proceeds. 
Here, the final amounts owed to BONYM from the 
foreclosure sale were not determined until the Fees Order was entered on May 23, 2022, following the May 17, 2022 closing, and after the April 12, 2022 Confirmation Appeal was filed. The 
Fees Order finally determined and granted BONYM post-
33 We take judicial notice that the 35th day from the April 12, 2022
Confirmation Order was May 17, 2022.

foreclosure-decree interest, attorneys' fees, costs, and 
expenses pursuant to the Foreclosure Decree; the Fees Order arose out of, was dependent upon, and was thus "incidental" to the Foreclosure Decree. See Black's Law Dictionary, at 879. 
The Fees Order also directed payment of these additional amounts 
from the proceeds of the foreclosure sale, which had resulted in a surplus rather than a deficiency. Finally, the Fees Order ordered the Commissioner to deposit "with the Court" "any excess funds not paid to [BONYM] at closing of the sale," which would be "retained by the Court subject to further determination and 
order when all appeals in this case have been decided and 
exhausted." Accordingly, the Circuit Court retained jurisdiction to enter the Fees Order even after the Confirmation Appeal was filed because the Fees Order determined the final amounts owed to BONYM upon the closing of the sale, and distributed the proceeds of the sale, all of which were incidents to the enforcement of the Foreclosure Decree.
