APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
(CASE NO. AB 2018-082; DCD NO. 2-15-48583)
ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Wadsworth, JJ.)
Upon consideration of self-represented Claimant-
Appellant Lord Harry S. Umayam's (Umayam) March 11, 2020 letter
requesting to "stop the appeal," which the court construes as a
motion to dismiss the appeal, the papers in support, the record,
and there being no opposition, it appears that (1) the appeal has
not been docketed; (2) Umayam seeks to dismiss the appeal; and
(3) dismissal is authorized by Hawai#i Rules of Appellate
Procedure Rule 42(a).
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion is
granted and the appeal is dismissed.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai#i, April 17, 2020.
