Upon review of "Claimant-Appellee-Appellant Monica G.
Scarlett 's Motion for Reconsideration  of Notice of Untimely 
Request for Extension Dated March 14, 2024" filed on March 22, 
2024, the papers in support, and the record, it appears that: 
1. The 
Judgment on Appeal  was entered on February 9, 
2024; 
2. An application for a writ of certiorari under 
Hawai#i Rules of Appellate Procedure ( HRAP) Rule 40.1(a)(1) or a 
request for an extension of time to apply for a writ of certiorari under HRAP Rule 40.1(a)(2) was due on Monday, March 11, 2024; 
3. Our February 28, 2024 Order extending the deadline 
for us to rule on Scarlett's February 20, 2024 motion for NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
reconsideration was entered under HRAP Rule 40(d), and did not 
extend the time for Scarlett to apply for a writ of certiorari or to request an extension of time to file an application for a writ of certiorari; and 
4. Scarlett's request for extension of time to file 
application for writ of certiorari was filed on March 13, 2024, more than 30 days after entry of the Judgment on Appeal, and was untimely. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion for 
Reconsideration is denied.
