dangerous drug in the second degree.  On January 19, 2018, he was
convicted and sentenced to four years probation.  He did notappeal his conviction.
On July 9, 2018, Raquinio sued HCPD, Segobia, and HCPD
officers Jeremy Lewis, Edward Lewis, and Kyle Hirayama  in federal
court.  He alleged various claims relating to his January 11,
2017 arrest.  The defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings. The federal court granted the motion and entered judgment. Raquinio appealed.  The Ninth Circuit dismissed the appeal asfrivolous.  Raquinio v. Haw. Police Dep't

Raquinio petitioned the state circuit court for post-
conviction relief under Hawai #i Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 40
on October 15, 2019.  We take judicial notice of the documentsfiled in 3PR19100002K (the Rule 40 Proceeding ).
4  Raquinio argued
that he received ineffective assistance from his defense counsel,
Frank Miller.  The court denied the petition.  Raquinio appealed. 
We vacated in part and remanded for further proceedings. 
Raquinio v. State , No. CAAP-20-0000301, 2022 WL 1284969 (Haw.
App. Apr. 29, 2022) (SDO).  On remand, Raquinio moved to dismiss. The circuit court granted the motion and dismissed the Rule 40Proceeding with prejudice.
Raquinio filed the complaint below on April 22, 2019.  
Named as defendants were HCPD, Jeremy, Edward, Segobia, Hirayama,HCPD officers Sean Smith and Michael Hardie (collectively, theHCPD Defendants ), and Miller.  The HCPD Defendants moved to
dismiss.  Miller filed a substantive joinder.  The circuit court
entered an order granting the motion on October 15, 2019.  TheFinal Judgment was entered for the HCPD Defendants and Miller,against Raquinio.  This appeal followed.
3We take judicial notice of the Ninth Circuit order and mandate
under Hawaii Rules of Evidence ( HRE) Rule 201(c) (2016).

The motion to dismiss was supported by 12 exhibits. 
Exhibit "3"  was a copy of Raquinio's January 11, 2017 arrestreport.  The circuit court considered the arrest report in rulingon the motion to dismiss.  We apply the standard of review for amotion for summary judgment.  See
 Hawai#i Rules of Civil
Procedure Rule 12(b).  We review a grant of summary judgment denovo.  Nozawa v. Operating Engineers Local Union No. 3
, 142
Hawai#i 331, 338, 418 P.3d 1187, 1194 (2018).  Summary judgment
is appropriate if there is no genuine issue of material fact andthe moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Id.
 at 342, 418 P.3d at 1198.  We "may affirm a grant of summary
judgment on any ground appearing in the record, even if thecircuit court did not rely on it."  Reyes v. Kuboyama
, 76 Hawai #i
137, 140, 870 P.2d 1281, 1284 (1994).
(1)The HCPD Defendants were entitled to summary
judgment.  Raquinio's tort and civil rights claims against the
HCPD Defendants all relate to his arrest on January 11, 2017. They accrued at the latest on January 12, 2017, when he wasreleased from custody.  His complaint below was filed onApril 22, 2019, over two years later.  His claims are time-barred.  HRS § 657-7 (2016); Pele Def. Fund v. Paty
, 73 Haw. 578,
595, 837 P.2d 1247, 1259 (1992) (holding that two-year statute oflimitations in HRS § 657–7 governs 42 U.S.C. § 1983 actions).
Raquinio's claims against the HCPD Defendants are also
barred because a criminal defendant who has not overturned theirconviction cannot maintain a civil tort lawsuit based on claimsthat necessarily imply the invalidity of the conviction. Penaflor v. Mossman
, 141 Hawai #i 358, 363-64, 409 P.3d 762, 767-
68 (App. 2017) (discussing Heck v. Humphrey , 512 U.S. 477, 484-86 
(1994)).
Raquinio's briefs contain no discernible argument about
his claims for injunctive relief.  The circuit court did not errby granting the HCPD Defendants' motion.
(2)None of the four counts in Raquinio's complaint
alleged a claim against Miller.  The complaint states only that
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Miller and the deputy prosecuting attorney did not let Raquinio
enter the courtroom for a hearing on a motion to suppress.  Construed liberally, that could allege ineffective assistance ofcounsel.  But Raquinio made that claim in the Rule 40 Proceeding. It was dismissed with prejudice.  "[A] dismissal 'withprejudice'[] is an adjudication on the merits of all the issuesthat were raised or could have been raised in the pleadings. Thus, subsequent litigation involving the same claims would bebarred by res judicata."  Land v. Highway Constr. Co.
, 64 Haw.
545, 551, 645 P.2d 295, 299 (1982).
For these reasons, the December 18, 2019 "Final
Judgment" is affirmed.
