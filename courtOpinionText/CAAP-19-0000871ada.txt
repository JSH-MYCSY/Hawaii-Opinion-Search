MAY 27, 2022  
GINOZA, CHIEF JUDGE, WADSWORTH AND NAKASONE, JJ. 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY NAKASONE, J. 
This appeal considers whether, under Hawai# i law, a 
family court may grant tie-breaking authority to one parent in a  
 
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
joint legal custody award, if the court determines that it is in 
the child's best interests. We hold that a family court is not precluded from ordering joint legal custody with tie-breaking authority to one parent based on the court's broad discretion, if it determines that doing so is in the child's best interest. 
In this consolidated appeal,
1 Plaintiff-Appellant "KS" 
(Mother) appeals from orders and a decree arising out of a trial 
regarding her divorce from Defendant-Appellee "RS" (Father), 
entered by the Family Court of the First Circuit (Family Court).2 
In CAAP-19-0000871, Mother appeals from the November 25, 2019 
Decision and Order Re: Trial, Child Support Guidelines Worksheet, and Property Division Chart (Trial Order); and the December 16, 
2019 Decree Granting Absolute Divorce and Awarding Child Custody 
(Divorce Decree).
3 In CAAP-20-0000489, Mother appeals from the 
June 29, 2020 Order Re: Plaintiff's Motion to Amend or Alter Decision and Order and Granting Defendant's Motion to Enforce Decree (Order Re: Post-Judgment Motions).

In CAAP-19-0000871, Mother raises twelve (12) points of 
error (POEs), contending that the Family Court erred: 
(1) in FOF 47 by determining that the Court could not 
order joint legal custody with tie-breaking authority; 
(2) in FOF 47 by finding that it would not be in 
Child's best interest if either party has sole legal custody; 
1 We consolidated CAAP-19-0000871 and CAAP-20-0000489 by an Order of
Consolidation filed on June 15, 2021, and the appeals were consolidated under
CAAP-19-0000871. 
2 The Honorable Jessi L.K. Hall presided. 
3 In CAAP-19-0000871, after Mother filed her December 23, 2019
Notice of Appeal, the Family Court entered its March 9, 2020 SupplementalRecord on Appeal: Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law ( March 9, 2020

Appeal from the Order Re: Post-Judgment Motions, the Family Court entered itsSeptember 21, 2020 Supplemental Record on Appeal: FOFs/COLs ( September 21,

(12) in COLs 22 and 32 where the Court "denied spousal 
support to [Mother] as an offset" for the "erroneous and inequitable equalization payment set forth in COL 31, without

was entitled to under [Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)] § 580-

would have outweighed the equalization payment that the Court 
arrived at." 
In CAAP-20-0000489, Mother raises seventeen POEs of 
which twelve are identical to the POEs in CAAP-19-0000877. The following five additional POEs
5 pertain to the disposition of 
"Plaintiff's Motion to Alter or Amend Decision and Order After Trial filed November 25, 2019, and to Stay Execution of Order and for Hearing Pursuant to Rules 59(e) and 62(b), Hawai# i Family 
Court Rules" (
Motion to Alter), in which Mother contends the 
Family Court erred: 
(13) in refusing to grant Mother's Motion to Alter; (14)
 in concluding as a matter of law that it could not 
grant Mother's Motion to Alter because an appeal was pending; 
(15) in COLs 5-7 in the September 21, 2020 FOFs/COLs 
setting forth the reasoning why the Family Court took no further action on the Motion to Alter; 
(16) in FOF 5 in the September 21, 2020 FOFs/COLs by 
making a finding of an erroneous filing date; and 
(17) in not granting Mother's Motion to Alter to make 
Father responsible for health care coverage for Child, and erred in COL 21 in the March 9, 2020 FOFs/COLs where Mother was made 
responsible for Child's health coverage. 
As to CAAP-19-0000871, we vacate in part with respect 
to the dispute resolution provisions of the award of joint 
custody, and the determinations regarding spousal support. As to CAAP-20-0000489, we vacate the Order Re: Post-Judgment Motions to the extent it did not address Mother's Motion to Alter. 
I. BACKGROUND 
Mother and Father were married in 2006 and separated in 
2017. Mother and Father are the parents of Child, who was born in 2014 during the marriage. The Complaint for Divorce was filed on January 30, 2018, and trial was held on October 28 and 29, 2019. Following trial, the Family Court filed: 1) the November 
5 We have renumbered the new POEs 13 to 17. 
4 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
25, 2019 Decision and Order; 2) the December 16, 2019 Divorce 
Decree; and 3) the March 9, 2020 FOFs/COLs.6 
In the Divorce Decree, the Family Court: 1) granted 
the divorce; 2) ordered joint legal and joint physical custody to Father and Mother; 3) set forth the joint physical custody schedule, with exchange times and locations, and set alternating holiday schedules; 4) directed Father and Mother to mutually agree to division of school breaks, and if no agreement could be reached, discussion with a Parenting Coordinator; 5) ordered Father to pay child support to Mother; 6) addressed other issues such as child-related expenses, education and educational expenses, and extracurricular expenses; 7) ordered Father to provide for Child's medical and dental insurance coverage; 8) declined to award alimony to either parent; 9) discussed award of Father and Mother's assets, insurance, and individual debts; 10) waived the equalization payment Mother would have had to pay Father, in lieu of an award of alimony;
7 11) ordered the parties 
to file separate taxes for 2019, and going forward; and 12) ordered that each party be responsible for their own attorney's fees and costs. 
Mother timely appealed from the Trial Order and Divorce 
Decree in CAAP-19-0000871 on December 23, 2019, as a self-represented litigant. Mother submitted the Motion to Alter on December 5, 2019, but it was not heard until March 11, 2020, along with Father's motion to enforce the Divorce Decree. At the March 11, 2020 hearing, per Mother's request, the hearing on her Motion to Alter was continued to May 20, 2020. No transcript was requested for the May 20, 2020 hearing. The Order Re: Post-Judgment Motions filed on June 29, 2020 contains the disposition of the motions from the May 20, 2020 hearing, and reflects that the Family Court took "no further action" and did not render a decision as to Mother's Motion to Alter, citing the pending 
6 The Divorce Decree is substantially similar to the Decision and
Order. The March 9, 2020 FOFs/COLs set forth the Family Court's reasoning. 
7 As to the equalization payment, the Divorce Decree stated: "15. 
Equalization Payment. In lieu of alimony, [Mother] shall not be required to
pay the equalization payment set out in the Property Division Chart attachedhereto."

appeal in CAAP-19-0000871. 
Instead, the Family Court granted 
Father's motion to enforce the Divorce Decree. On July 29, 2020, 
under CAAP-20-0000489, Mother filed a Notice of Appeal from the June 29, 2020 Order Re: Post-Judgment Motions. 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A. Family Court Decisions 
"Generally, the family court possesses wide discretion 
in making its decisions and those decisions will not be set aside 
unless there is a manifest abuse of discretion." Hamilton v. 
Hamilton, 138 Hawai# i 185, 197, 378 P.3d 901, 913 (2016) (citing 
Kakinami v. Kakinami, 127 Hawai# i 126, 136, 276 P.3d 695, 705 
(2012) (quoting Fisher v. Fisher, 111 Hawai# i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 
355, 360 (2006))). 
It is well established that a family court abuses its
discretion where "(1) the family court disregarded rules orprinciples of law or practice to the substantial detrimentof a party litigant; (2) the family court failed to exerciseits equitable discretion; or (3) the family court's decisionclearly exceeds the bounds of reason." 
Kakinami, 127 Hawai# i at 155-56, 276 P.3d at 724-25 (citations 
omitted). "[T]he family court is given much leeway in its 
examination of the reports concerning a child's care, custody, and welfare, and its conclusions in this regard, if supported by the record and not clearly erroneous, must stand on appeal." Fisher
, 111 Hawai# i at 46, 137 P.3d at 360 (citation omitted). 
B. Family Court's Findings of Fact and
Conclusions of Law 
"The family court's findings of fact are reviewed under 
the clearly erroneous standard, while the court's conclusions of law are reviewed de novo under the right/wrong standard." Gordon 
v. Gordon, 135 Hawai# i 340, 348, 350 P.3d 1008, 1016 (2015) 
(citing Kakinami, 127 Hawai# i at 136, 276 P.3d at 705)). 
A [finding of fact] is clearly erroneous when (1) the record
lacks substantial evidence to support the finding, or (2)despite substantial evidence in support of the finding, theappellate court is nonetheless left with a definite and firmconviction that a mistake has been made. "Substantial evidence" is credible evidence which is of sufficient 
6 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable
caution to support a conclusion. 
Kakinami, 127 Hawai# i at 136, 276 P.3d at 705. 
"[W]hen a conclusion of law presents mixed questions of 
fact and law, we review it under the 'clearly erroneous' standard 
because the court's conclusions are dependent on the facts and circumstances of each individual case." JW v. RJ, 146 Hawai# i 
581, 585, 463 P.3d 1238, 1242 (App. 2020) (citing Estate of Klink ex rel. Klink v. State, 113 Hawai# i 332, 351, 152 P.3d 504, 523 
(2007)). "A conclusion of law that is supported by the trial court's findings of fact and reflects an application of the correct rule of law will not be overturned." Id. 
C. Statutory interpretation 
"Statutory interpretation is a question of law 
reviewable de novo." JD v. PD, 149 Hawai# i 92, 96, 482 P.3d 555, 
559 (App. 2021) (citation omitted). 
In construing statutes, we 
observe the following principles: 
First, the fundamental starting point for statutory
interpretation is the language of the statute itself.Second, where the statutory language is plain andunambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plainand obvious meaning. Third, implicit in the task ofstatutory construction is our foremost obligation toascertain and give effect to the intention of thelegislature, which is to be obtained primarily from thelanguage contained in the statute itself. Fourth, whenthere is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or indistinctivenessor uncertainty of an expression used in a statute, anambiguity exists. 
Id. (citation omitted). 
D. Family Court Post-Judgment Motions 
We review a family court's ruling on a Hawai# i Family 
Court Rules (
HFCR) Rule 59(e) motion under the abuse of 
discretion standard. See Tagupa v. Tagupa, 108 Hawai# i 459, 465, 
121 P.3d 924, 930 (App. 2005) (citation omitted). 
"An abuse of 
discretion occurs if the trial court has clearly exceeded the 
bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant." Id.
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).

III. DISCUSSION 8
A. Custody Award, POEs 1-8 
1. The Family Court's award of joint legal
and physical custody was not erroneous. 
We first address Mother's contentions in POEs 2-6 that 
the Family Court's award of joint legal custody was erroneous. 
In POE 2, Mother challenges FOF 47's finding that: "it would not be in the minor child's best interest if either party has sole legal custody, as the other party would be prohibited from providing input;" and in POE 6, COL 15's conclusion that "it is in the best interest of the Child that the parties shall have joint legal and joint physical custody." In POE 3, Mother claims the Family Court failed to apply the "best interest" factors in HRS § 571-46(b).  In POEs 4 and 5, Mother challenges FOFs 59, 
9
8 We have reorganized, consolidated, and restated Mother's points of
error for clarity. 
9 HRS § 571-46 (2018), entitled "Criteria and procedure in awarding
custody and visitation; best interest of the child," provides in subsection
(b) that: 
(b) In determining what constitutes the best interest of
the child under this section, the court shall consider, butnot be limited to, the following: 
(1) Any history of sexual or physical abuse of achild by a parent; 
(2) Any history of neglect or emotional abuse of achild by a parent; 
(3) The overall quality of the parent-childrelationship; 
(4) The history of caregiving or parenting by eachparent prior and subsequent to a marital or othertype of separation; 
(5) Each parent's cooperation in developing andimplementing a plan to meet the child's ongoingneeds, interests, and schedule; provided that thisfactor shall not be considered in any case wherethe court has determined that family violence hasbeen committed by a parent; 
(6) The physical health needs of the child;
 
(7) 
The emotional needs of the child; 
(8) The safety needs of the child; 
(9) The educational needs of the child;

62-64, and COL 14,  which contain the Family Court's findings10 
(10) The child's need for relationships with
siblings; 
(11) Each parent's actions demonstrating that theyallow the child to maintain family connectionsthrough family events and activities; providedthat this factor shall not be considered in anycase where the court has determined that familyviolence has been committed by a parent; 
(12) Each parent's actions demonstrating that theyseparate the child's needs from the parent'sneeds; 
(13) Any evidence of past or current drug or alcoholabuse by a parent; 
(14) The mental health of each parent; 
(15) The areas and levels of conflict present withinthe family; and 
(16) A parent's prior wilful misuse of the protectionfrom abuse process under chapter 586 to gain atactical advantage in any proceeding involvingthe custody determination of a minor. 
Such 
wilful misuse may be considered only if it isestablished by clear and convincing evidence,and if it is further found by clear andconvincing evidence that in the particularfamily circumstance the wilful misuse tends toshow that, in the future, the parent who engagedin the wilful misuse will not be able to cooperatesuccessfully with the other parent in their sharedresponsibilities for the child. The court shall articulate findings of fact whenever relying uponthis factor as part of its determination of thebest interests of the child. For the purposes ofthis section, when taken alone, the voluntarydismissal of a petition for protection from abuseshall not be treated as prima facie evidence thata wilful misuse of the protection from abuseprocess has occurred. 
10 FOFs 59, 62-64, and COL 14 state as follows: 
[(Findings of Fact)] 
59. The video shows that the minor child did not wish to 
transition to [Mother]. 
. . . . 
62. [Mother] then requested a uniformed police officer to
walk up to the minor child to bring the minor child to her. 
63. There was nothing that prohibited [Mother] from walking
to the minor child, who was no longer near [Father]. 
64. The Court finds that said action was not in the best 
interest of the minor child.

regarding a video showing a time-sharing exchange of Child 
between the parents at the main police station, and the Court's conclusions regarding the video evidence. 
POE 4 also challenges 
the conclusion that "some of [Mother's] behavior" was "detrimental" to Child in COL 14. 
Mother argues that the Family Court erred in COLs 14 
and 15, and FOFs 47, 59, and 62-64, because, "[i]nstead of and without applying all of the sixteen statutory factors in HRS § 571-46(b), the family court at COL 14 made vague references to '[Mother]'s behavior' being 'detrimental' to [Child]." Mother claims the "lack of explanation" shows that there was "some unwritten factor or bias [that] formed a substantial basis" of the Court's custody decision. Mother asserts that instead of looking at the totality of all of the best interest factors, the Family Court abused its discretion by its "myopic focus on one time-sharing exchange" which occurred pursuant to court order with restrictions imposed by the police station. 
The findings in FOFs 59, 62, and 63, and the mixed 
conclusion of law and fact in FOF 64 regarding the video of the time-sharing exchange, are supported by substantial evidence and not clearly erroneous.
11 See Gordon, 135 Hawai# i at 348, 350 P.3d 
at 1016; JW, 146 Hawai# i at 585, 463 P.3d at 1242. "It is well-
settled that an appellate court will not pass upon issues dependent upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight of 
[(Conclusions of Law)] 
14. The Court finds that some of [Mother's] behavior has
been detrimental to the minor child, but the Court further finds
that the minor child's need to be with both parents outweighs theeffects of [Mother's] actions. 
11 The video recorded by Mother is 9 minutes, 45 seconds long, and
appears to show the parties exchanging Child at the Honolulu Police Departmentmain station. Child is seen crying and reluctant to walk through the metaldetector, from Father outside the security barrier, to Mother seated insidethe area past the metal detector, recording the video. Father comforts Child. Mother is heard repeatedly asking Father to help Child through the metaldetector. Father does not respond, except to hold his hand up in response toMother who says: "This is part of the problem - can you help [Child]through?" Mother tells an officer sitting nearby that she may need assistanceto escort Child through the metal detector, but the officer declines. Father says goodbye and leaves. The remaining video shows Mother talking to Child.

evidence; this is the province of the trier of fact." Fisher
, 
111 Hawai# i at 46, 137 P.3d at 360 (quoting In re Doe, 95 Hawai# i 
183, 190, 20 P.3d 616, 623 (2001)). The Family Court viewed and 
weighed the video evidence as factfinder, and we do not disturb its findings on appeal. 
The record does not show that the Family Court abused 
its broad discretion in weighing the best interest factors in determining the award of custody. 
In determining custody, "the 
family court is granted broad discretion to weigh the various factors involved, with no single factor being given presumptive paramount weight, in determining whether the standard has been met." Inoue v. Inoue, 118 Hawai# i 86, 105, 185 P.3d 834, 853 
(App. 2008) (quoting Fisher, 111 Hawai# i at 50, 137 P.3d at 364). 
Numerous findings appear pertinent to the factors the Family Court had to consider in its custody determination, including any history of abuse by a parent, the quality of the parent-child relationship, each parent's ability to separate their own needs from the child's needs, each parent's mental health, areas and levels of conflict present in the family, and parental cooperation to implement plans to meet Child's needs. See HRS § 
571-46(b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(5), (b)(12), (b)(14), (b)(15). The Court made findings regarding Father's lack of mental health diagnosis or any other issue affecting his ability to parent. FOFs 15, 16, and 17. 
Abuse was not a concern in this case. FOF 
19. The Family Court found the parents had poor communication, 
difficulty co-parenting in a peaceful manner, with Mother driving much of the conflict. FOFs 22, 46, and 48. Mother quit and refused using the Parenting Coordinator, and failed to respond to Father's requests to discuss the issue. FOFs 49 and 50. The Court noted there were incidents where Mother would not share information with Father and said it was because Father did not ask. FOF 51. Mother told Child that she feared Father. FOF 52. Mother's actions in the time-sharing video were "not in the best interest" of Child. FOFs 59-64. COL 14, containing the Court's finding and conclusion that some of Mother's behavior was "detrimental" but nevertheless outweighed by Child's need to be with both parents, is actually a mixed FOF and COL subject to the 
11 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
clearly erroneous standard of review. See JW
, 146 Hawai# i at 
585, 463 P.3d at 1242. The Court's finding in COL 14 that 
Mother's behavior was "detrimental" to Child is supported by the unchallenged findings above
12 and the challenged video findings 
in FOFs 59, and 62-64, all of which were within the Court's province as the factfinder. The record shows the Court weighed the facts that it found and applied the best interest factors in arriving at its conclusion that Child's "need to be with both parents outweigh[ed]" the effects of Mother's "detrimental" actions. COL 14. Thus, COL 14 was not wrong. 
The family court "is given much leeway in its 
examination of the reports concerning a child's care, custody, and welfare, and its conclusions in this regard, if supported by the record and not clearly erroneous, must stand on appeal." Fisher, 111 Hawai# i at 46, 137 P.3d at 360. On this record, the 
Court's conclusion in FOF 47, that it would not be in Child's best interest if either parent had sole legal custody because the other parent would not have an opportunity for input, and ultimate conclusion in COL 15 that joint legal and physical custody of Child was in Child's best interest, were not erroneous. See Gordon, 135 Hawai# i at 348, 350 P.3d at 1016. 
2. A joint custody award with a tie-breaking
provision is not precluded by statute. 
We next address Mother's contentions in POEs 1, 7, and 
8, related to the joint custody award. In these POEs, Mother 
challenges FOF 20, and the second sentence of FOF 47, which state: 
20. Although Dr. Acklin's report recommended what was
equivalent to sole legal custody to [Mother] or
alternatively joint legal custody with tie breakingauthority to [Mother], he testified that he would agree thatthe parties could have joint legal custody so long as therewas a neutral body that could assist them with any disputes. 
. . . . 
47. It would not be in the minor child's best 
interest if either party has sole legal custody, as theother party would be prohibited from providing input. The 
12 Unchallenged findings of fact are binding upon appeal. In re Doe,

12 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Court cannot order joint legal custody with tie breaking
authority. 
(Emphasis added). 
FOF 20 is a recitation of Dr. Marvin Acklin's (Dr. 
Acklin) report and testimony as custody evaluator, which Mother 
disagrees with, but does not specifically challenge. As FOF 20 
appears to accurately set forth Dr. Acklin's recommendation and testimony, it is not clearly erroneous. Gordon, 135 Hawai# i at 
348, 350 P.3d at 1016. 
In POEs 1 and 2, Mother contends that the Family Court 
erred in FOF 47 by ruling that the court "could not order joint legal custody with tie-breaking authority." In POEs 7 and 8, Mother challenges FOF 20 that the parties could have joint legal custody so long as there was a neutral body to assist them in disputes; and Mother opposes the imposition of a costly and burdensome dispute resolution process that Mother says she could not afford.
13 
Mother argues that the Family Court made an erroneous 
"conclusion of law about tie-breaking authority that is reviewable de novo," when it stated in FOF 47 that it could not order joint legal custody with tie-breaking authority. Mother asserts that the Family Court was not barred, under the

provided:

joint legal and joint physical custody. 
For joint legal custody, the parties shall be required
to discuss any legal issues via Our Family Wizard. A party
shall have forty-eight (48) hours to respond regarding alegal custody issue. If there is no response within forty-eight (48) hours, then the non-responsive party will beconsidered to be in agreement with the legal custodydecision proffered. 
In the event of an impasse regarding child-related
issues, [Mother] and [Father] shall attempt to resolve theissue through Mediation Center of the Pacific or othermutually agreed upon mediator. If the parties are unable toresolve the issue through mediation, then they shall retainthe services of a Parenting Coordinator if they are unableto agree on any child-related issues.

"governing statutory scheme" of HRS § 571-46  or HRS § 571-
46.1,  from awarding tie-breaking authority to one parent in a 
joint custody award; and that the Family Court could do so as a

award, and subsection (a)(4) provides for an investigation and report by a
child custody evaluator to aid the court: 
(a) . . . . In awarding the custody, the court shall be
guided by the following standards, considerations, andprocedures: 
(1) Custody should be awarded to either parent or to
both parents according to the best interests of thechild, and the court also may consider frequent,continuing, and meaningful contact of each parent withthe child unless the court finds that a parent isunable to act in the best interest of the child; 
. . . . 
(4) Whenever good cause appears therefor, the court
may require an investigation and report concerning thecare, welfare, and custody of any minor child of theparties. 
When so directed by the court, investigators
or professional personnel attached to or assisting thecourt, hereinafter referred to as child custodyevaluators, shall make investigations and reports thatshall be made available to all interested parties andcounsel before hearing . . . . 
(Emphases added). 
15 HRS § 571-46.1 (2018), entitled "Joint custody," provides: 
(a) Upon the application of either parent, joint custody
may be awarded in the discretion of the court. For the 
purpose of assisting the court in making a determinationwhether an award of joint custody is appropriate, the courtshall, upon the request of either party, direct that aninvestigation be conducted pursuant to the provisions ofsection 571-46(a)(4). 
(b) For the purposes of this section, "joint custody" means
an order awarding legal custody of the minor child or
children to both parents and providing that physical custodyshall be shared by the parents, pursuant to a parenting plandeveloped pursuant to section 571-46.5 . . . . 
(Emphasis added). The child custody evaluator's report is also used by acourt to determine the appropriateness of a joint custody award. See HRS §
571-46(a)(4).

Family Court has "broad powers," "inherent authority[,] and 
discretion to include tie-breaking provisions in a joint legal custody award under appropriate circumstances involving parents who cannot communicate effectively, where not otherwise constrained by statute." 
To support her argument, Mother primarily relies on a 
Maryland case, 
Santo v. Santo, 141 A.3d 74, 89 (Md. 2016), in 
which the Maryland Court of Appeals held: 
[A] court of equity ruling on a custody dispute may, under
appropriate circumstances and with careful considerationarticulated on the record, grant joint legal custody toparents who cannot effectively communicate togetherregarding matters pertaining to their children. In doing
so, the court has the legal authority to include tie-breaking provisions in the joint legal custody award. 
(Emphasis added). In Santo, the father challenged the trial 
court's award of joint custody with tie-breaking provisions as illegal, because it violated the custody statute as it was "neither single nor joint, but a hybrid of the two—an option not set forth in the statute." Id. at 83. The Santo Court explained 
that the lower court's authority to award custody did not derive solely from statute, but also from common law, and the "broad and inherent authority of a court exercising its equitable powers to determine child custody." Id. at 84 (quoting Taylor v. Taylor, 
508 A.2d 964, 968 (Md. 1986)).
17 The Court considered the 
propriety of "tie-breaking provisions" in joint custody awards that "grant one parent the authority to make a decision about a matter affecting the child when the parents cannot agree." Id. 
at 76. The Santo Court explained: 
In a joint legal custody arrangement with tie-breaking
provisions, the parents are ordered to try to decidetogether matters affecting their children. When, and only 
general equity powers as authorized by law
. 
(Emphasis added). 
17 In Taylor, decided thirty years prior, the Maryland Court of
Appeals held that "an award of joint custody was a permissible exercise of atrial court's general equity powers" and the "most important factor for acourt to consider before awarding joint custody is the capacity of the parentsto communicate and to reach shared decisions affecting a child's welfare."Santo, 141 A.3d at 76 (citing Taylor, 508 A.2d at 964). 
15 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
when the parties are at an impasse after deliberating in
good faith does the tie-breaking provision permit one parentto make the final call. Because this arrangement requires agenuine effort by both parties to communicate, it ensureseach has a voice in the decision-making process. 
Id. at 81. Because the Maryland custody statute authorized joint 
custody without any limitations, and because the Santo Court considered joint custody with tie-breaking provisions to be a form of joint custody, it held that such a custody award was not precluded by statute. Id. at 84. 
The Santo Court considered authority from other 
jurisdictions that have affirmed such provisions granting one parent "tie-breaking authority," or "final decision-making authority," in light of a family court's broad discretionary powers. See id. at 81-83 (citing Ronny M. v. Nanette H., 303 
P.3d 392, 405 (Alaska 2013) ("The court's approach [awarding joint legal custody with final decision-making authority to mother] is reasonably intended to encourage both parents to communicate and attempt to make decisions about their children . . . ."); State on behalf of Maddox S. v. Matthew E., 873 N.W.2d 208, 219 (Neb. Ct. App. 2016) ("We also point out that the court maintained the goal of 'mutual agreement' between the parties . . . .; only now, the final say as to certain major issues rests with the designated parent if they cannot otherwise agree."); Shea v. Metcalf, 712 A.2d 887, 891 (Vt. 1998) ("By avoiding an 'all or nothing approach,' the order keeps both parents in the role of active parenting, takes full advantage of their individual strengths, and avoids awarding either parent responsibility for which he or she is not suited.")). 
Other jurisdictions have affirmed provisions granting 
tie-breaking or final decision-making authority to one parent in shared or joint legal custody situations, as within the family court's broad discretionary powers. See, e.g. Nicaise v. 
Sundaram, 432 P.3d 925, 928 (Ariz. 2019) (providing that vesting final decision-making authority in one parent may be appropriate in instances where "the parents cannot reach a joint agreement in good faith," and such award of joint legal decision-making with one parent having final authority does not "necessarily give[]

App. 2015) (holding that circuit court did not erroneously 
exercise its discretion in ordering joint custody with final decisions as to medical matters to mother, and "final decision-making authority" as to education to father, "after the parties have conferred"). 
Here, the Family Court concluded that tie-breaking was 
not an option available to it, and did not consider it.
18 The 
Family Court's statement in FOF 47 that: "[t]he Court cannot order joint legal custody with tie breaking [sic] authority" is a conclusion of law reviewable de novo. See Doe, 95 Hawai# i at 
190, 20 P.3d at 623. We conclude that the applicable statutes in Hawai
#i -- HRS § 571-3, HRS § 571-46, and HRS § 571-46.1 –- do 
not preclude a family court from granting tie-breaking authority to one parent in a joint legal custody award if such a provision 
18 The transcript also reflects that the Family Court believed it
could not order tie-breaking authority: 
Q [FATHER'S COUNSEL]: Do you think that you should be
the only one making the decision in the event of a
disagreement? 
A [MOTHER]: No. I don't think I'm the only one. I 
think that there should be discussion, and that's ultimatelywhat I had proposed numerous times. 
THE COURT: I want to make sure everybody is aware. I 
cannot order tiebreaking authority. So I don't know why weeven discuss it. It's either joint or sole. So youmentioned it too. 
[MOTHER'S COUNSEL]: I know. 
THE COURT: It's in your position even. So let's –-[MOTHER'S COUNSEL]: Well, we were hoping at some
point there might be a stip still. 
THE COURT: As long as everybody's clear, I can't
order it. 
[FATHER'S COUNSEL]: The reason I'm discussing it now,
Your Honor, is just to essentially demonstrate what was
taking place during the pendency of this litigation. 
THE COURT: No. I understand that. But when you're
talking about what the decree is going to look like, I can'tdo tiebreaking.

is in the best interests of the child. 
HRS § 571-46(a), setting 
forth the best interests of the child criteria for custody 
determinations, does not have language that would preclude an award of joint custody with tie-breaking authority to one parent. The joint custody statute, HRS § 571-46.1(a), provides for joint custody awards "in the discretion of the court." HRS § 571-46.1(b) provides: 
For the purposes of this section, "joint custody" means an
order awarding legal custody of the minor child or childrento both parents and providing that physical custody shall beshared by the parents, pursuant to a parenting plandeveloped pursuant to section 571-46.5, in such a way as toassure the child or children of frequent, continuing, andmeaningful contact with both parents; provided, however,that such an order may award joint legal custody withoutawarding joint physical custody.

A "parenting plan" under HRS § 571-46.5  may include provisions 
related to "[p]arental decision-making" and methods "for 19

Hollaway v. Hollaway

n.6 (App. 2014), overruled on other grounds by Waldecker v. O'Scanlon, 137 Hawai# i 460, 375 P.3d 239 (2016) (noting that in 
19 HRS § 571-46.5 (2018) provides: 
(a) For every action that includes a contested custody of
children, both parties or both parents shall developeither a mutually agreed-upon general parenting planor separate individually-desired parenting plan, andfile the plan at the outset of the action. 
. . . . 
(c) A detailed parenting plan may include, but is notlimited to, provisions relating to:

(2) Develop and file a detailed parenting plan whenrequested by either of the parties or parents. 
The March 9, 2020 FOFs/COLs do not reflect whether a parenting
plan under HRS § 571-46.5 was used in determining joint custody. 
The record 
does not indicate that a "mutually agreed-upon" parenting plan or "separateindividually-desired" parenting plans were filed "at the outset of the action"under HRS § 571-46.5(a).

cases where joint custodial parents reach an impasse in decision-
making regarding their child, preliminary alternatives such as a parenting plan could lead to a better-informed resolution of immediate issues, as well as serving as a means for the parents to develop co-parenting skills that would best serve the child). It is well-recognized that the family courts possess "wide discretion" in making decisions. Fisher, 111 Hawai# i at 46, 137 
P.3d 355 at 360. 
Here, Dr. Acklin recommended that "the parties share 
physical custody," and that the Court order "shared legal custody with [Mother] having tie breaking [sic] authority . . . ." FOF 12. The Family Court found that Mother and Father did not 
communicate effectively and blamed each other for their inability to communicate. See
 FOFs 21 and 46. Several e-mails in evidence 
reflected the parties' difficulties with communicating in a "peaceful and co-parenting manner." FOF 48. Although Dr. Acklin's report recommended "what was equivalent to sole legal custody to [Mother] or alternatively joint legal custody with tie breaking [sic] authority to [Mother]," Dr. Acklin testified that the parties "could have joint legal custody" as long as "there was a neutral body that could assist them with any disputes." FOF 20. Even though Dr. Acklin had recommended joint legal custody with tie-breaking authority to Mother, the Family Court determined that it "cannot order joint legal custody with tie breaking [sic] authority" and imposed joint legal custody with a mandatory dispute resolution process. FOFs 12 and 47. Thus, the record reflects that the Family Court rejected tie-breaking authority as a matter of law, and ordered a dispute resolution process modeled after Dr. Acklin's testimony that the parties "could have joint legal custody so long as there was a neutral body that could assist them with any disputes." FOF 20. 
Under the circumstances of this case, we conclude that 
the Family Court was not precluded from ordering joint legal custody with tie-breaking authority to one parent, based on its broad discretion, if the Court determined that this was in Child's best interests. See Fisher, 111 Hawai# i at 46, 137 P.3d 
at 360; Santo, 141 A.3d at 84. FOF 47 reflects that the Court 
21 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
wanted to avoid a situation where one parent was prohibited from 
providing input. 
An approach awarding parents joint custody with 
one parent having tie-breaking authority can be structured to encourage both parties to communicate and to require both parents to attempt to make decisions together. See Santo, 141 A.3d at 
81. Joint custody with tie-breaking authority is an alternative 
that addresses the Court's expressed concern of avoiding a situation where one parent is excluded from having input. In light of the above, we vacate the Family Court's orders to the extent it held it could not order joint legal custody with tie-breaking authority and regarding the dispute resolution process and costs set forth in the Divorce Decree, which were raised in POEs 1, 7, and 8. We remand for further proceedings on these issues consistent with this opinion. 
B. Equalization payment, POE 11 
Mother challenges FOF 101, and COL 31,
20 where the 
Family Court imposed the "inequitable equalization payment" based 
on Father's "late-disclosed" and "unsubstantiated" debts, which consisted of (1) a personal loan for attorneys' fees and costs claimed by Father in an asset and debt statement dated one week before trial; and (2) a student loan that was not supported by corroborating evidence.

C. Spousal Support, POE 12 
In POE 12, Mother contends that the Family Court erred 
in making COLs 22 and 32,22 where the Court "denied spousal 
support" to Mother as an "offset" for the $20,871.48 equalization 
payment in COL 31, without first calculating the amount of spousal support to which Mother was entitled. Mother's contention has merit. 
"We review the family court's final division and 
distribution of the estate of the parties under the abuse of discretion standard, in view of the factors set forth in HRS § 580-47 and partnership principles." Gordon, 135 Hawai# i at 348, 
350 P.3d at 1016 (citations omitted). 
When deciding the issue of spousal support: 
The first relevant circumstance is the payee's need. What 
amount of money does he or she need to maintain the standardof living established during the marriage? The second relevant circumstance is the payee's ability to meet his orher need without spousal support. Taking into account thepayee's income, or what it should be, including the netincome producing capability of his or her property, what ishis or her reasonable ability to meet his or her needwithout spousal support? The third relevant circumstance is the payor's need. What amount of money does he or she needto maintain the standard of living established during themarriage? The fourth relevant circumstance is the payor'sability to pay spousal support. Taking into account thepayor's income, or what it should be, including the incomeproducing capability of his or her property, what is his orher reasonable ability to meet his or her need and to payspousal support? 
Wong, 87 Hawai# i at 485, 960 P.2d at 155 (citations and brackets 
omitted). 
HRS § 580-47(a) (2018) requires the family court to 
consider the following criteria in deciding spousal support: 
"the respective merits of the parties, the relative abilities of the parties, the condition in which each party will be left by the divorce, the burdens imposed upon either party for the benefit of the children of the parties, . . . and all other circumstances of the case." HRS § 580-47(a) further requires the court to consider a list of thirteen additional factors. Id.
22 COL 22 states: "Neither party shall be required to provide
support or maintenance for the other party." COL 32 states: "In lieu of 
alimony, [Mother] shall not be required to pay the equalization payment setout in the PDC." 
24 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
While the record reflects some findings pertinent to the 
statutory considerations such as the parties' financial resources (
see FOFs 76, 79, and 83 relating to each party's income), 
ability of Mother to meet her needs independently (see FOF 89 regarding Mother's work history and desire for further education, and FOFs 95 and 96 regarding changes in Mother's earning capacity), the findings and conclusions do not reflect an assessment of the statutory factors and a determination of the factual inquiries set forth in Wong, which the Family Court itself quoted in COLs 6 and 7. See I.S. v. P.S., Nos. 30179, 
CAAP-10-0000082, 2013 WL 4458889, at *8 (App. Aug. 21, 2013) (mem.) (holding that the family court "abused its discretion in awarding Wife $2,000 a month in alimony without some indication that it had considered the factors pursuant to HRS § 580-47(a) or made the relevant factual determinations."). In light of this record, the Family Court's conclusions in COLs 22 and 32, where the Court found neither party should provide support or maintenance for the other party and the Court waived Mother's equalization payment in lieu of alimony, are erroneous and thus vacated because the record does not indicate that the Family Court considered the HRS § 580-47(a) factors or made the relevant factual determinations set out in Wong. See id.; Fisher, 111 
Hawai#i at 46, 137 P.3d at 360. On remand, the Family Court must 
conduct the statutory analysis under HRS § 580-47(a) and the Wong inquiries to determine whether or not Mother should receive spousal support, and if so, determine the appropriate amount. 
D. Exhibits, POEs 9-10 
Mother contends in POE 9 that the Family Court erred by 
refusing to allow Mother to introduce stipulated exhibits due to 
the Court's "personal policy." In POE 10, Mother challenges FOF 108, which states: "Each side chose to withdraw several exhibits at the end of trial." Mother argues that the Family Court abused its discretion in "deeming as withdrawn" the majority of Mother's trial exhibits which were not objected to by Father, pursuant to the Family Court's "personal policy." The Family Court stated in unchallenged FOF 38, however, that the Court "does not have a policy, nor is there a rule that the Court will automatically 
25 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
accept stipulations made by the parties." 
Mother did not object 
or request that any particular exhibit be admitted, and her 
contentions are waived.23 See Kawamata Farms, 86 Hawai# i at 248,

pursuant to the ten-day deadline in HFCR Rule 59(e),25 and thus 
was timely filed. Both Mother and Father agree that the Motion 
to Alter was filed on December 5, 2019, and not January 9, 2020 as indicated in FOF 5 in the September 21, 2020 FOFs/COLs.
26 In 
DL v. CL, 146 Hawai# i 415, 421, 463 P.3d 1072, 1078 (2020), the 
Hawai#i
 Supreme Court held that "the family court clerk's 
acceptance and date stamping of a HFCR Rule 59 motion as 'received' was 'a filing that satisfied the jurisdictional requirements of HFCR Rule 59(a) and (e).'" Here, the Motion to Alter had a "received" stamp of December 5, 2019 by the family court clerk but was not file-stamped until January 9, 2020. Under DL, the "received" stamp date of December 5, 2019 constituted filing of the motion on that date, and 
not January 9, 
2020. Id.We agree with Mother's contention in POE 16 that the 
Family Court clearly erred when it found the motion was filed on the latter date in FOF 5. See Gordon, 135 Hawai# i at 348, 350 
P.3d at 1016. 
b. This court has jurisdiction to
review the Order Re: Post-JudgmentMotions. 
HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) required the Family Court to dispose 
of Mother's December 5, 2019 Motion to Alter "within 90 days 
after the date the motion was filed." The Order Re: Post-Judgment Motions that took no action on the Motion to Alter was not issued until June 29, 2020, which is beyond the 90-day period specified by HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) requires that, if the court fails to enter an order disposing of the motion within 90 days, then "within 5 days after the 90th day," the 
25 HFCR Rule 59(e), entitled "Motion to reconsider, alter or amend a
judgment or order," provides in relevant part: "[A] motion to reconsider,
alter or amend a judgment or order is not required but may be filed no laterthan 10 days after entry of the judgment or order and shall be a non-hearingmotion, except that the court in its discretion may set any matter forhearing." (Emphases added). 
26 FOF 5 states: "5. [Mother], via counsel, filed her Motion to
Alter or Amend Decision and Order After Trial Filed November 25, 2019 and StayExecution of Order and Hearing Pursuant to Rules 59(e) and 62(b), HawaiiFamily Court Rules, on January 9, 2020." (Emphases added). 
28 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
court clerk "shall notify the parties that, by operation of this 
Rule, the post-judgment motion is denied and that any orders entered thereafter shall be a nullity." 
Here, the Family Court did not dispose of Mother's 
Motion to Alter within 90 days of the filing of the motion, 
and 
the clerk of the court also failed to issue a notice by the 95th day, informing the parties that the motion was denied pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) and that any order entered thereafter was a nullity. The rule "does not contemplate this dual failure of both the court and the court's clerk to execute the requirements of the rule." Sanchez v. Sanchez, NO. CAAP-17-0000407, 2021 WL 
4777103, at *8 (App. Oct. 13, 2021) (SDO). Under the circumstances of this case, we conclude that the Order Re: Post-Judgment Motions was not a nullity for purposes of determining whether the appeal was timely because the required clerk's notice under the rule was never provided. If we interpreted the rule as Father urges us to, that after 90 days there was a "deemed denial" of Mother's Motion to Alter for purposes of whether an appeal was timely, it "renders superfluous the requirement that the clerk provide notice to the parties of the deemed denial." Id. For purposes of the deadline to appeal, the Motion to Alter 
was not "deemed" denied under HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) where no clerk's notice was issued. Rather, we conclude that the Order Re: Post-Judgment Motions constituted the disposition of Mother's post-
judgment Motion to Alter. See HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) ("The notice of 
appeal shall be deemed to appeal the disposition of all post-
judgment motions that are timely filed after entry of the judgment or order."). Thus, Mother's appeal is timely because her earlier, timely-filed Notice of Appeal from the Divorce Decree in CAAP-19-0000871 is deemed to appeal the disposition of 
her timely filed Motion to Alter. See id.; Sanchez, 2021 WL 
4777103, at *8.

2. Motion to Alter, POEs 14 and 15 
Mother's contentions in POEs 14 and 15, that the Family 
Court erred in COLs 5-7 in ruling that it could not consider the 
Motion to Alter because a Notice of Appeal had been filed, have merit. 
COLs 5-7 in the September 21, 2020 FOFs/COLs, state: 
5. It is well settled that "once a party files a
notice of appeal, the lower court is generally divested of
jurisdiction to proceed further on the matter." Kakinami v. 
Kakinami, 127 Hawai #i 126, 143, 276 P.3d 695, 712 (2012)
(citing Lowther v. Lowther, 99 Hawai #i 569, 578, 57 P.3d
494, 503 (App. 2002)). While a case is up on appeal, theCourt may enforce a prior order, but may not modify theprior order. Id
. 
6. The Family Court was divested of jurisdiction to
hear [Mother's] Motion to Alter or Amend Decision and OrderAfter Trial Filed November 25, 2019 and Stay Execution ofOrder and Hearing Pursuant to Rules 59(e) and 62(b), HawaiiFamily Court Rules, filed on January 9, 2020. 
7. It was proper for the Family Court to take no
further action on [Mother's] January 9, 2020 Motion. 
Mother argues that, although courts are generally divested of 
jurisdiction upon the filing of a notice of appeal, pursuant toHRAP Rule 4(a)(3), the Family Court "retained jurisdiction to alter or amend the decree for another 90 days . . . ."  
The Hawai# i Supreme Court has explained that: 
The general rule is that courts are divested of jurisdiction
upon the filing of a notice of appeal. Kakinami, 127
Hawai #i at 143, 276 P.3d at 712. However, in Buscher v. 
Boning, 114 Hawai #i 202, 221, 159 P.3d 814, 833 (2007), this
court held that the 1999 version of HRAP Rule 4(a)(3)"supersedes the line of cases standing for the propositionthat the circuit court lacks jurisdiction to award costsafter a notice of appeal is filed" and "provides that thecourt has 90 days to dispose of a post-judgment motion toreconsider, vacate, or alter the judgment, or seeksattorney's fees or costs, regardless of when the notice ofappeal was filed." 
Although HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) has since
been amended, the language providing that a court has 90days to dispose of a timely post-judgment motion has notchanged substantively. 
DL, 146 Hawai# i at 421-22, 463 P.3d at 1078-79 (brackets, 
internal quotation marks, and footnotes omitted). Here, as noted 
supra, the Motion to Alter filed December 5, 2019 was a timely filed post-judgment motion. The Family Court retained jurisdiction to consider it, even though a Notice of Appeal had 
30 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
been filed on December 23, 2019. 
The Family Court erred in 
concluding in COLs 5-7 that it lacked jurisdiction over the 
motion because an appeal had been filed. See id.; HRAP Rule 
4(a)(3). 
Accordingly, we vacate the Order Re: Post-Judgment 
Motions to the extent the Family Court took no further action on the Motion to Alter, and remand for the Family Court to consider the motion on its merits. In view of this resolution, it is unnecessary to address Mother's remaining contentions in POEs 13 and 17 regarding the merits of the Motion to Alter. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, as to CAAP-19-0000871, we 
vacate in part (1) the Family Court of the First Circuit's November 25, 2019 Decision and Order Re: Trial, Child Support Guidelines Worksheet, and Property Division Chart; and (2) the December 16, 2019 Decree Granting Absolute Divorce and Awarding Child Custody, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion, as follows: 
(1) The award of joint custody is affirmed, but the 
orders regarding the dispute resolution process and costs are vacated; (2) The award of joint custody is remanded to 
determine whether a grant of tie-breaking authority is appropriate as part of the joint custody award; and (3) The issue of spousal support is remanded to 
determine whether spousal support should be awarded, and if so, a determination of the amount. 
We otherwise affirm in part as to the remainder. 
As to CAAP-20-0000489, we vacate in part the June 29, 
2020 Order Re: Plaintiff's Motion to Amend or Alter Decision and Order and Granting Defendant's Motion to Enforce Decree to the 
31 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
extent it did not address the Plaintiff's Motion, and remand for 
consideration of that motion on the merits, consistent with this Opinion.
