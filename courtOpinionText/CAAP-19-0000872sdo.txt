(Judgment ) entered by the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit
(Circuit Court ).2  Defendant-Counterclaim Plaintiff-
Appellee/Cross-Appellant Puna Geothermal Venture, a Hawai ‘i
General Partnership ( PGV), cross-appeals from the Judgment and
challenges the Circuit Court's May 6, 2015 Order Denying [PGV's]
Motion to Dismiss Complaint, or in the Alternative, Motion for
Summary Judgment ( Order Denying Dismissal ).
Puna Pono raises two points of error on appeal,
contending that the Circuit Court erred in:  (1) denying the May
25, 2016 Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment
(Plaintiffs' MPSJ ); and (2) granting PGV's June 30, 2016 Motion
for Summary Judgment ( PGV's MSJ ) and the County of Hawaii's
(County's ) July 1, 2016 Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment
(County's MSJ ).
PGV also raises two points of error on appeal,
contending that the Circuit Court erred in:  (1) denying PGV's
March 3, 2015 motion to dismiss; and (2) dismissing PGV's
Counterclaim without adjudicating Counts II and III of the
Counterclaim.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve the parties' points of error as follows:
2The Honorable Greg K. Nakamura presided.  
2NOT FOR PUBLICATIO N IN W EST' S HAWAI#I REP ORTS AND P ACIF IC REP ORTER
Puna Pono's Appeal
Puna Pono requested partial summary judgment declaring
that Hawai #i County Code ( HCC) § 14-114 (2012) was a legislative
act authorized by Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 46-17 (2012)
and is not preempted by State law.  The County, as well as PGV,
opposed the motion.  PGV filed, inter alia , a cross-motion for
summary judgment on multiple grounds, including but not limited
to preemption.  The County also filed, inter alia , a cross-motion
for summary judgment on multiple grounds, including but not
limited to preemption. 
HCC § 14-114 provides: 
Section 14-114.  Restrictions. 
Geothermal resources exploration drilling and
geothermal production drilling operations being conducted
one mile or less from a residence, shall be restricted to
the operating hours of 7:00 a.m. – 7:00 p.m.
HRS § 46-17 provides: 
§ 46-17  Regulation of certain public nuisances.   Any
provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding, the
council of any county may adopt and provide for the
enforcement of ordinances regulating or prohibiting noise,
smoke, dust, vibration, or odors which constitute a public
nuisance.  No such ordinance shall be held invalid on the
ground that it covers any subject or matter embraced within
any statute or rule of the State; provided that in any case
of conflict between a statute or rule and an ordinance, the
law affording the most protection to the public shall apply,
with the exception that:
(1)  An ordinance shall not be effective to the
extent that it is inconsistent with any permit
for agricultural burning granted by the
department of health under authority of chapter
342B, or to the extent that it prohibits,
subjects to fine or injunction, or declares to
be a public nuisance any agricultural burning
conducted in accordance with such a permit; and
(2)An ordinance shall not be effective to the
extent that it is inconsistent with any noise
rule adopted by the department of health under
authority of chapter 342F.
 On October 10, 2016, the Circuit Court entered a
Decision and Order Denying [Plaintiffs' MPSJ], Granting [PGV's
3NOT FOR PUBLICATIO N IN W EST' S HAWAI#I REP ORTS AND P ACIF IC REP ORTER
MSJ], and Granting [County's MSJ] ( Decision and Order ).  In the
Decision and Order, the Circuit Court stated that the specific
issue to be addressed was whether HCC § 14-114 is enforceable
against PGV, and the broader issue was whether HCC § 14-114 is
preempted by State law.  The Circuit Court pointed to various
provisions of HRS Chapter 182, Reservation and Disposition of
Government Mineral Rights, and Hawai #i Administrative Rules ( HAR)
Title 13, Sub-Title 7, Chapter 183, Rules on Leasing and Drilling
of Geothermal Resources, to highlight the comprehensive State
statutory and regulatory scheme providing the Board of Land and
Natural Resources ( Board) the power to regulate geothermal well
drilling activities, including through the granting of a drilling
permit.  The Circuit Court concluded that HCC § 14-114 conflicted
with the Board's power to regulate geothermal drilling
activities, and therefore, it was preempted by the State
statutory and regulatory regime.
On appeal, both the County and the State (as well as
PGV) filed answering briefs setting forth a whole host of reasons
why the Circuit Court's ruling should be affirmed, most
importantly, that Hawaii's comprehensive statutory and regulatory
scheme regulating geothermal resources preempts the ordinance.
The Hawai #i Supreme Court recently reaffirmed the test
applicable to the issue of preemption:
As we stated in Ruggles v. Yagong, 135 Hawai #i 411,
353 P.3d 953 (2015):
A county's power to promulgate ordinances is governed
by Article VIII, Section 1 of the Constitution of the State
of Hawai #i, which states, "The legislature shall create
counties, and may create other political subdivisions within
4NOT FOR PUBLICATIO N IN W EST' S HAWAI#I REP ORTS AND P ACIF IC REP ORTER
the State, and provide for the government thereof.  Each
political subdivision shall have and exercise such powers as
shall be conferred under general laws."  (Emphasis added.) 
Thus, pursuant to the Hawai #i Constitution, a county's
powers are limited to those conferred by the legislature
under general laws.  The legislature has outlined the
"General powers and limitations of the counties" in HRS §
46-1.5 (2012).  HRS § 46-1.5(13) [2018] provides
Each county shall have the power to enact ordinances
deemed necessary to protect health, life, and
property, and to preserve the order and security of
the county and its inhabitants on any subject or
matter not inconsistent with, or tending to defeat,
the intent of any state statute where the statute does
not disclose an express or implied intent that the
statute shall be exclusive or uniform throughout the
State[.]
Ruggles, 135 Hawai #i at 422, 353 P.3d at 964.
HRS § 46-1.5(13) was intended to mandate "the
preemption of any ordinance that either conflicted with the
intent of a state statute or legislated in an area already
staked out by the legislature for exclusive and statewide
statutory treatment."  Richardson v. City and Cnty. of
Honolulu, 76 Hawai #i 46, 60, 868 P.2d 1193, 1207 (1994).
A municipal ordinance may be preempted by state law
"if (1) it covers the same subject matter embraced within a
comprehensive state statutory scheme disclosing an express
or implied intent to be exclusive and uniform throughout the
state or (2) it conflicts with state law."  Richardson, 76
Hawai#i at 62, 868 P.2d at 1209 (citations omitted).
State v. Pickell, SCWC-21-0000530, 2023 WL 8889767, *3-4 (Haw.
Dec. 26, 2023).
We conclude that HCC § 14-114 covers the same subject
matter as that set forth in the comprehensive State statutory and
regulatory scheme governing geothermal resources, and that this
scheme is impliedly intended to be exclusive and uniform. 
Therefore, we conclude that the Circuit Court did not err in
reaching this conclusion.
PGV's Cross-Appeal
PGV first argues that the Circuit Court erred in
denying its motion to dismiss Puna Pono's complaint on the
grounds that it failed to state a claim upon which relief could
5NOT FOR PUBLICATIO N IN W EST' S HAWAI#I REP ORTS AND P ACIF IC REP ORTER
be granted.  However, in light of our conclusion that the Circuit
Court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of PGV and
against Puna Pono, we conclude that this issue is moot.  See
generally Leone v. Cnty. of Maui, 141 Hawai ‘i 68, 89, 404 P.3d
1257, 1278 (2017).
PGV further argues that the Circuit Court erred when it
summarily dismissed Counts II and III of its Counterclaim when
the Circuit Court entered judgment in favor of PGV based on
preemption.  Count II of the Counterclaim sought a declaratory
ruling that HCC § 14-114 is unenforceable because it is
unconstitutionally vague, ambiguous, and overbroad.  Count III of
the Counterclaim sought a declaratory ruling that HCC § 14-114
cannot be enforced against it based on its vested rights and
equitable estoppel.  
"A fundamental and longstanding principle of judicial
restraint requires that courts avoid reaching constitutional
questions in advance of the necessity of deciding them."  Rees v.
Carlisle, 113 Hawai ‘i 446, 456, 153 P.3d 1131, 1141 (2007)
(citation omitted).  In addition, the Circuit Court's ruling in
favor of PGV on the grounds that preemption rendered HCC § 14-114
unenforceable rendered PGV's request for relief on alternative
grounds moot.  See Leone, 141 Hawai ‘i at 89, 404 P.3d at 1278.3 
3 PGV has not argued that an exception to the mootness doctrine
applies here.
