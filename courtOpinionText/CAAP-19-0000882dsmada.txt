APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 2CC161000209(3)) 
ORDER 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Upon review of the "Motion to Dismiss Defendants-
Appellant's [sic] Appeals Filed December 30, 2019 and Filed 
May 11, 2022" filed by Plaintiff-Appellee The Bank of New York Mellon (BONY) on June 30, 2022, the papers in support, the 
memorandum in opposition filed by Defendants-Appellants Dale 
Allen Ward and Melanie Renee Ward (the Wards) on July 7, 2022, 
and the record, it appears that: NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
1. BONY filed a mortgage foreclosure action against 
the Wards, among others, docketed in the Judiciary Information 
Management System as 2CC161000209 (the Foreclosure Action); 
2. The circuit court entered a Judgment of 
Foreclosure in the Foreclosure Action in favor of BONY and 
against the Wards on December 2, 2019; 
3. The Wards appealed from the Judgment of 
Foreclosure, creating CAAP-19-0000882 (the Foreclosure Appeal); 
4. The Wards did not obtain a stay of the Foreclosure 
Action pending the Foreclosure Appeal; 
5. The property which was the subject of the 
Foreclosure Action (the Property) was sold to a third party, Michael Wick, at the foreclosure auction; 
6. BONY filed a motion to confirm the sale of the 
Property to Wick; 
7. The Wards' memorandum in opposition to BONY's 
motion to confirm sale did not argue that Wick was not a good 
faith purchaser
1 of the Property; 
8. The circuit court entered a judgment in the 
Foreclosure Action confirming the sale of the Property to Wick on 
April 5, 2022 (Judgment Confirming Sale); 
9. The Wards appealed from the Judgment Confirming 
Sale, creating CAAP-22-0000323 (the Confirmation of Sale Appeal); 
10. The Wards did not obtain a stay of the Foreclosure 
Action pending the Confirmation of Sale Appeal; 
11. The Property was conveyed to Wick by 
Commissioner's Deed recorded in the State of Hawai# i Bureau of 
Conveyances on May 10, 2022;2 
1 A "good faith purchaser is one who, by an honest contract or
agreement, purchases property or acquires an interest therein, without
knowledge, or means of knowledge sufficient to charge him in law withknowledge, of any infirmity in the title of the seller." Bank of New York 
Mellon v. R. Onaga, Inc., 140 Hawai #i 358, 367 n.13, 400 P.3d 559, 568 n.13
(2017) (cleaned up). 
2 We may consider this new evidence because it relates to
mootness. Queen Emma Found. v. Tatibouet, 123 Hawai #i 500, 507 n.8, 236 P.3d
1236, 1243 n.8 (App. 2010). 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
12. In response to the Motion to Dismiss, the Wards 
submitted no evidence tending to show that Wick was not a good 
faith purchaser of the Property; 
13. The Foreclosure Appeal and the Confirmation of 
Sale Appeal are moot because the Wards did not obtain a stay of the Foreclosure Action pending the Foreclosure Appeal or the Confirmation of Sale appeal, and the Property has been sold to Wick, a good faith purchaser. R. Onaga, Inc., 140 Hawai# i at 
367, 400 P.3d at 568; 
14. The Wards cite Ally Bank v. Hochroth, Nos. CAAP-
17-0000911 and CAAP-18-0000465 (consolidated), 2020 WL 1929172 (Haw. App. April 21, 2020) (SDO) for the proposition that their appeals are not moot, but Hochroth did not involve the sale of the foreclosed property to a good faith purchaser; and 
15. The Wards argue that "they are seeking damages 
against" BONY, and "when this case is remanded to the trial court, the Wards will be entitled to recover treble damages from" BONY; however, there are no remaining claims in the Foreclosure Action because the Wards did not assert a counterclaim against BONY, see Bank of Am., N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 143 Hawai# i 249, 
264, 428 P.3d 761, 776 (2018), as corrected (Oct. 15, 2018) (holding that mortgagor may assert a counterclaim for wrongful foreclosure based on the underlying facts of the pending foreclosure case). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion to 
Dismiss is granted, CAAP-19-0000882 and CAAP-22-0000323 are both dismissed as moot, and any pending motions in either appeal are dismissed.
