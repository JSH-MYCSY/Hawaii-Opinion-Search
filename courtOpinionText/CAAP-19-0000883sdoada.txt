APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 3CC15100166K) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and Nakasone, JJ.) 
This case involves a dispute between Hawai #i Island 
real property owners. Iokepa Subdivision  is makai of 
Māmalahoa 
Highway. Makai of Iokepa Subdivision, mauka of Hienaloli-Kahului 
Road, is Makana Aloha Plantation Subdivision . Some lots in 
Iokepa Subdivision are closer to Hienaloli-Kahului Road than to Māmalahoa Highway. Some Iokepa Subdivision lot owners ( Iokepa
Owners) claim an easement through Makana Aloha Plantation 
Subdivision to access Hienaloli-Kahului Road. 1
On May 23, 2016, a first amended complaint for 
declaratory and injunctive relief was filed. Certain owners of Iokepa Estates sued the Makana Aloha Plantation Association and the Makana Aloha Plantation Subdivision lot owners ( Makana Aloha 
Parties). Some of the Makana Aloha Parties counterclaimed. The 
2
1 Iokepa Owners are Dale Roderic Laurance, Lynda Eileen Laurance,
Brandy Nichole Laurance, Lisa G. Yamura, Frank Gomes, Betty Doi Gomes,
Joseph A. Gomes, Keith A. Gomes, Robin W. Ledson, Waiaha System, LLC, Kelly F.Gomes, Randall J. Gomes, and S. Joseph Stanek.

Circuit Court of the Third Circuit entered summary judgment for 
the Makana Aloha Parties on Iokepa Owners' amended complaint.3 
The court ruled that Iokepa Owners did not have an easement to access Hienaloli-Kahului Road through Makana Aloha Plantation Subdivision. The court awarded attorneys fees and costs to Makana Aloha Parties, and entered a Hawai #i Rules of Civil 
Procedure Rule 54(b)-certified Final Judgment  on February 26, 
2020. 
Iokepa Owners appeal. They challenge the: (1) May 28, 
2019 order granting summary judgment for Makana Aloha Parties;(2) December 4, 2019 order certifying the summary judgment as 
final and staying the counterclaims; and (3) December 4, 2019 
order granting in part and denying in part Makana Aloha Parties' 
motion for attorneys fees and costs (the Fee Order ). Makana 
Aloha Parties cross-appeal from the Final Judgment, also challenging the Fee Order. We affirm the Final Judgment in part (paragraph nos. 1 and 3), vacate in part (paragraph no. 2), and remand for further proceedings. 
IOKEPA OWNERS' APPEAL 
(1) We review a grant of summary judgment de novo.

genuine issues of material fact. We must decide whether the claimed easement exists as a matter of law based on the evidence presented to the circuit court.

Persons in possession of property may create express 
easements  by grant, for a consideration or by gift,

formalities  in the local jurisdiction for transferring

Real Property
 § 60.03(a)(1) at 405 (Thomas ed., 1994 & Supp. 
2000)). 
The land that eventually became Iokepa Subdivision and 
Makana Aloha Plantation Subdivision was once owned by the Gomes 
Family Limited Partnership. In 1998, Gomes Family applied to 
Hawai#i County to subdivide the land into 15 lots. The County 
tentatively approved a preliminary plot map subject to several conditions, including: 
9. For the subdivision roadway, construct 20-ft. wide
agricultural pavement within a minimum 50-ft. widthright-of-way conforming to Standard Detail R-39. 
Gomes Family asked for a variance from condition no. 9. 
It explained: 
The purpose of this subdivision is to move the property fromthe trust ownership to twelve (12) individual heirs thatwill own lots #4 - #15. The proposed roadway will servethese twelve lots. Lots #1-#3 will have direct access off of Hienaloli-Kahului Road. 
. . . . 
The proposed street will serve twelve family agriculturallots with standard pavement with grass swales. 
The roadway
will provide safe access and will eliminate unnecessarygrading and land disruption that would exacerbate drainageissues and be less pleasing aesthetically. 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On June 7, 2000, the County approved the variance for 
"12[]lots of a 15-lot subdivision[.]" The road was built and 
provides the 12 lots in Iokepa Subdivision with access to Māmalahoa Highway. 
On September 1, 2000, the Gomes Family deeded the land 
to Iokepa Estates LLC . The County granted final subdivision 
approval on September 17, 2002. Iokepa Subdivision and Makana Aloha Plantation Subdivision were severed when Iokepa Estates LLC transferred Lots 1-3 to Iokepa Makai, LLC  by Warranty Deed , 
recorded on January 7, 2003. The deed stated: 
DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY : 
The property covered by this Warranty Deed is
described in Exhibit "A" attached to this document. 
. . . . SELLER'S WARRANTIES : 
By signing this Warranty Deed, [Iokepa Estates LLC]
gives [Iokepa Makai, LLC] a general warranty of title as to
their interest. This means that [Iokepa Estates LLC]guarantees: 
. . . . 
(c) That there are no other claims by any person
against the property or the other rights being sold and noother person has any rights in the property unless thoseclaims or rights are described in Exhibit "A" under thetitle "SUBJECT TO[.]" 
Exhibit A contained metes and bounds descriptions of 
Lots 1, 2, and 3, stamped by licensed professional land surveyor 
Chrystal Thomas Yamasaki . Exhibit A concluded: 
SUBJECT TO, however, the following: 
(1) Reservation in favor of the State of Hawaii of all 
mineral and metallic mines. 
Exhibit A did not acknowledge an easement burdening 
Lots 1, 2, or 3. Iokepa Owners do not contend that Iokepa Estates LLC burdened Lots 1, 2, or 3 with an easement to benefit Lots 4-15 when the land ownership was severed. 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
During January, 2003, Iokepa Makai, LLC applied to the 
County to consolidate Lots 2 and 3 and re-subdivide them into 16 
lots that would become Makana Aloha Plantation Subdivision.  The 
County gave tentative subdivision approval on June 3, 2003, subject to several conditions including: 4
10. For the proposed Access Easement A-1, construct
minimum 20-ft. wide dedicable pavement with pavedshoulders and swales, within a minimum 50-ft. wideright-of-way meeting with the approval of theDepartment of Public Works (DPW). 
11. Construct dedicable turnaround meeting with theapproval of the DPW. 
On June 27, 2003, Iokepa Makai, LLC applied for a 
variance from conditions 10 and 11. It explained: 
The purpose of this subdivision is to develop the threeexisting parcels into sixteen (16) single family residential1-acre or larger lots. The proposed roadway will servefourteen of these sixteen lots. Lots 3-A and 3-B will have direct access off of Heinaloli-Kahului [sic] Road. 
. . . . . . . For Condition No. 10, the applicant is seeking to
construct a private road with a gated entry, using 20-ft.wide asphalt paving with inverted swales and 6-ft. widegrass shoulders in a 32-ft wide excavation within a 50-ft.wide right-of-way. . . . For Condition No. 11, theapplicant is seeking to use the same private-road standardturnaround but not to be dedicable since there is no planfor any future subdivision off of it. See the accompanyingdrawings for reference. 
. . . . 
The proposed gated private road will serve fourteen family
agricultural lots  with 20-ft pavement with 6-ft grass
shoulders. The roadway will provide safe access and will
eliminate unnecessary grading and land disruption that wouldexacerbate drainage issues and be less pleasingaesthetically. 
The applicant believes this roadway standard is consistent
with neighboring properties and the agricultural characterof the area. The roadway runs only into this subdivision
and will not affect neighboring properties . 
4 The applicant's name is shown as Iokepa Estates LLC, but this
appears to have been a mistake because Iokepa Makai, LLC owned Lots 2 and 3when the subdivision application was submitted. 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(Emphasis added.) 
The application did not state that the proposed roadway 
would also serve Iokepa Subdivision. On January 28, 2004, the 
County approved the variance. The approval stated: 
based on the representations made by the applicants and
evaluation of the current traffic patterns , the applicant's
alternative access and private roadway improvements to and
within the subdivision, the Planning Director has concludedthat the DPW roadway requirements and tentative subdivisionapproval conditions dated June 3, 2003 should be revised andmodified to allow the proposed 16-lot subdivisiondevelopment. 
(Emphasis added.) 
The proposed road became Pu Hoaloha Place. Pu Hoaloha 
Place runs over Makana Aloha Plantation Subdivision easement A-1. 
It ends in a turnaround. A private Driveway  for the two mauka-
most lots served by Pu Hoaloha Place runs off the turnaround, over Makana Aloha Plantation Subdivision easement A-2. 
During March and April 2004, Iokepa Makai, LLC granted 
easements to Hawaii Electric Light Company, Verizon Hawaii, and the County Water Board. The County granted final subdivision approval for Makana Aloha Plantation Subdivision on April 23, 2004. On April 28, 2004, Yamasaki recorded an affidavit in the Bureau of Conveyances. Exhibit A to Yamasaki's affidavit was the final subdivision approval. Exhibit B was the approved final subdivision plat map. Exhibit C contained metes and bounds descriptions for the 16 lots and easements A-1 and A-2, among others. None of the easement descriptions or headings mention Iokepa Subdivision. 
Midday on May 6, 2004, Roger Rule emailed Yamasaki. 
The subject read: "Makana Aloha Plantation ('Easements in Favor of' revisions)[.]" Attached to the email was "a one-page Word document with the Easements listed[.]" The email ended: "Dan is hoping you can get the changed Legal Descriptions to Matt before you leave." Yamasaki emailed Rule that night saying she'd completed the requested revisions. Those revisions form the 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
basis for Iokepa Owners' claim that "an express, or at least an 
implied, easement" was created for their benefit. 
About Rule's requested revisions, Yamasaki testified: 
Q. Now, we're looking at page 87. That's how it's 
marked. It's the description, a portion of the description
attached to the declaration of covenants. Did you draw --strike that. 
Did you draft the language stated in this document
describing Easement A-1? 
A. Yes. 
Yamasaki was testifying about the metes and bounds 
description for easement A-1 attached to the "DECLARATION OF 
PROTECTIVE COVENANTS, CONDITIONS, AND RESTRICTIONS FOR MAKANA ALOHA PLANTATION[.]" The heading on the first page stated: 
EASEMENT "A-1" 
FOR ACCESS AND UTILITY PURPOSES 
OVER AND ACROSS LOTS 2-A, 2-D, 2-L, 2-K, 3-C AND 3-E
AND AFFECTING LOTS 2-B, 2-C AND 3-D
IN FAVOR OF LOTS 1, 2-A, 2-B, 2-C, 2-D, 2-E, 2-F, 2-G, 2-H, 2-J, 2-K
2-L, 3-C, 3-D AND 3-E OF MAKANA ALOHA PLANTATION
ALSO IN FAVOR OF LOTS 4 THRU 15, INCLUSIVE OF IOKEPA ESTATES SUBDIVISION
LOT 6-B (aka TMK: 7-5-016: 036 (3rd Division)
AND TMK: 7-5-016: 028 (3rd Division) 
(Emphasis added.) 
Yamasaki explained: 
Q. Where did you get the information about what
Easement A-1 was created to benefit? 
A. Part of it is because it affects [Makana Aloha
Plantation Subdivision], and part of it we had a memo of
instruction from one of Dan Bolton's staff people, RogerRule. He had clarified easements and how they were to be infavor of different lots. 
Q. So you weren't looking at a grant of easement at
that time or any recorded documents in creating the languageconcerning the benefit of this easement? 
A. No. 
Iokepa Makai, LLC recorded the Declaration on May 13, 
2004. It contained these provisions: 
1.8 Roadway Easement.  "Roadway Easement" is
referred to on the Tentative Map as Easement A-1 which is 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
recorded as Easement A-1 of the original IOKEPA SUBDIVISION
(Lots 1-15) SUB 98-054,[5] and the Improvements (including
dry wells and other drainage facilities, utility boxes,equipment and facilities, and landscaping) located thereonor therein, except any apron or other paved area constructedsolely for the purpose of providing access from such RoadwayEasement to any Lot.[
6] 
. . . . 
2.1 Use Limitations.  . . . DISCLOSURE: [Iokepa
Makai, LLC] hereby notifies all lot owners and future lotowners of MAKANA ALOHA PLANTATION, that: 
a) [Iokepa Makai, LLC] is the owner of Lot 2-G andthe adjacent parcel to the north, TMK (3)7-5-16:36, and together with TMK (3) 7-5-16:28owned by Issmi [sic] Koga et al, [sic] mayconsolidate and resubdivide said three parcelsand to that end, [Iokepa Makai, LLC] reservesthe right to grant easements for access andutility purposes in favor of such new lots 
through the roadway lot of MAKANA ALOHAPLANTATION, exclusive and regardless of anyvoting percentages of the lot owners of MAKANAALOHA PLANTATION. 
(Emphasis added.)
 A condominium declaration can create an easement. 
Grinpas v. KAPAA 382, LLC, No. 30139, 2012 WL 503818, at *8 (Haw. 
App. Feb. 15, 2012) (citation omitted). 
An easement is created if the owner of the servient estate 
either enters into a contract or makes a conveyance intendedto create a servitude that complies with the Statute ofFrauds or falls within an exception to the Statute ofFrauds. 
As a general rule, to constitute a grant of an easement, any
words clearly showing the intention to grant an easement aresufficient. The intent to grant an easement must be somanifest on the face of the instrument, however, that noother construction can be placed on it. Thus, to create an 
5 This was probably another mistake, because SUB 98-054 created
easement A-1 to Mamalahoa Highway for Iokepa Subdivision Lots 4-15. Lots 1-3 had direct access to Hienaloli-Kahului Road. Makana Aloha Plantation Subdivision's easement A-1 to Hienaloli-Kahului Road was created by IokepaMakai, LLC in SUB 2003-0011. 
6 The Declaration defined "Lot" as: 
each of the subdivided Lots in MAKANA ALOHA PLANTATION as 
shown on any maps filed with the County of Hawaii and forwhich final subdivision approval has been received, togetherwith all rights and Improvements appurtenant thereto and allImprovements located thereon.

easement by express grant, there must be a writing
containing plain and direct language evincing the grantor'sintent to create a right in the nature of an easement[.] 
Id. at *7-8 (quoting 25 Am.Jur.2d Easements and Licenses  § 15 
(2004) (mem. op.)). 
Makana Aloha Plantation Subdivision's Declaration does 
not contain language granting an easement to any lot in Iokepa 
Subdivision. Iokepa Makai, LLC knew how to create an easement; it previously granted easements burdening Makana Aloha Plantation Subdivision to Hawaii Electric Light Company, Verizon, and the County's Water Board. The Declaration did not "observe the proper formalities in the local jurisdiction for transferring property by grant or by devise." Ass'n of Apartment Owners of 
Wailea Elua
, 100 Hawai#i at 122, 58 P.3d at 633. The heading for 
the easement descriptions appended to the Declaration, all drafted by Yamasaki, were based on the list emailed to her by Rule shortly before the Declaration was recorded. The headings do not contain language granting  an easement to any lot in Iokepa 
Subdivision. They were acknowledgments of what Yamasaki had been told by Rule were easements. 
See
 Grinpas , 2012 WL 503818, at *6 
("An acknowledgment in a deed of the existence of an easement is not equivalent to an intent to create an easement." (italics omitted) (quoting 25 Am.Jur.2d Easements and Licenses  § 15 
(2004)). 
Iokepa Owners acknowledge that "Yamasaki's testimony 
was that her Subdivision Affidavit and metes and bounds descriptions of [Makana Aloha Plantation Subdivision] Lots and Easements, 'are not themselves grants of easement.'" They rely on a declaration Yamasaki signed on February 22, 2017, stating: 
14. In my expert opinion, and with a reasonable
professional certainty as a Hawaii Licensed Professional 
Land Surveyor  and, the surveyor of the Makana Aloha
Plantation subdivision, Easements "A-1" and "A-2" contained
in Exhibits "A" to the recorded Declaration and WarrantyDeed, indicate that the owners of Lots 4 through 15 of theIokepa Estates subdivision have access (and for utilitypurposes) through the Makana Aloha Plantation subdivision toHienaloli-Kahului Road. 
10 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(Emphasis added.) 
Yamasaki was not competent to render such an opinion. 
See Santos v. Perreira , 2 Haw. App. 387, 393, 633 P.2d 1118, 1124 
(1981) (holding that "persons expert in the field of survey . . . 
are not expert in the fields of easement, highway, and conveyancing law, which they must be in order to render an expert opinion on the questions whether the road is legally a public road or whether the Santoses are legally entitled to a right-of-way") (footnote omitted). Her opinion is inadmissible under Hawaii Rules of Evidence Rule 702 (2016). We decline to consider it in our de novo review of the summary judgment order. 
Iokepa Owners argue that Declaration paragraph 4.2 
shows Iokepa Makai, LLC created an easement by recording the Declaration. Paragraph 4.2 states, in part: 
[Iokepa Makai, LLC] has granted  right of access to or
over the Roadway Easement to the Owner of other properties
other than Lots located within MAKANA ALOHA PLANTATION. 
(Emphasis added.) 
Paragraph 4.2 acknowledged an existing  easement not 
reflected in the record for this appeal. It does not state that 
Iokepa Makai, LLC grants or is granting  an easement to anyone by 
recording the Declaration. 
We conclude that the headings of the metes and bounds 
description for easements A-1 and A-2 attached to the Declaration did not create easements allowing Iokepa Owners to access Hienaloli-Kahului Road through Makana Aloha Plantation Subdivision. There is no other evidence in the record to support Iokepa Owners' claim to have an express easement.
(b) Implied easement. Iokepa Owners argue the heading 
for the metes and bounds descriptions of easements A-1 and A-2 created "at least an implied[] easement[.]" They cite no legal authority for when an implied easement may be recognized. They make no other discernible argument. Their points of error on 
11 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
this issue are waived. See Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
(HRAP
) Rule 28(b)(7) ("Points not argued may be deemed waived.").
(2) Iokepa Owners' points of error do not identify the 
circuit court's December 4, 2019 order certifying the summary 
judgment as final and staying the counterclaims. Nor do they present any discernible argument that the circuit court erred by certifying Makana Aloha Parties' summary judgment as final and staying the counterclaims. We disregard these issues, which are waived. See HRAP Rule 28(b)(4) ("Points not presented in accordance with this section will be disregarded[.]") and (7).
(3) Iokepa Owners' points of error do not identify the 
circuit court's December 4, 2019 Fee Order. Nor does their opening brief present any discernible argument that the circuit court erred by granting Makana Aloha Parties' motion for attorneys fees and costs. We disregard these issues, which are waived. See HRAP Rule 28(b)(4) and (7). 
MAKANA ALOHA PARTIES' CROSS-APPEAL 
Makana Aloha Parties' attorneys fee motion cited HRS 
§§ 607-14 and 421J-10. They requested $
600,092.49 in fees and 
$18,078.69 for costs. The circuit court awarded $150,023.12 in fees (25% of the amount requested) and $14,531.22 for costs. We review for abuse of discretion. Chun v. Bd. of Trs. of the Emps. 
Ret. Sys. of State
, 106 Hawai#i 416, 431, 106 P.3d 339, 354 
(2005). 
(1) Makana Aloha Parties contend the circuit court 
erred by applying HRS § 607-14's 25% limitation. 
HRS § 607-14 
(2016) provides, in part: 
The court shall then tax attorneys' fees, which the court
determines to be reasonable, to be paid by the losing party;
provided that this amount shall not exceed twenty-five per
cent of the judgment. 
. . . . 
The above fees provided for by this section shall be
assessed . . . upon the amount sued for if the defendant 
obtains judgment . 
12 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(Emphasis added.) 
The circuit court awarded Makana Aloha Parties 25% of 
the amount of attorneys fees requested, rather than 25% of "the 
judgment" or "the amount sued for." The court acted outside of its discretion by misapplying the plain language of HRS § 607-14. 
Iokepa Owners' amended complaint sought a declaration 
that an easement burdened Makana Aloha Plantation Subdivision for Iokepa Owners' benefit, and an injunction against future interference. HRS § 607-14's 25% limitation does not apply to such claims. See DFS Grp. L.P. v. Paiea Props
, 110 Hawai#i 217, 
221, 131 P.3d 500, 504 (2006). 
Makana Aloha Parties also argue that the 25% limitation 
does not apply because HRS § 607-14 provides: 
Nothing in this section shall limit the recovery of
reasonable attorneys' fees and costs by a planned community
association and its members  in actions for . . . the 
enforcement of any provision of the association's governing
documents , or affect any right of a prevailing party to
recover attorneys' fees in excess of twenty-five per cent of
the judgment pursuant to any statute that specifically
provides that a prevailing party may recover all of its
reasonable attorneys' fees . "Planned community association"
for the purposes of this section means a nonprofit
homeowners or community association existing pursuant tocovenants running with the land. 
(Emphasis added.) 
Makana Aloha Parties are "a planned community 
association and its members" within the meaning of HRS § 607-14. 
Iokepa Owners' January 14, 2019 motion for partial summary judgment sought to invalidate the First Amendment to Makana Aloha Plantation Subdivision's Declaration. Thus, the reasonable attorneys fees and costs incurred by the Makana Aloha Parties to defend the enforceability of the Declaration is not subject to the 25% limitation. 
13 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRS § 421J-10 (2004) provides: 
(a) All costs and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, incurred by or on behalf of the associationfor: 
. . . . 
(3) Enforcing any provision of the association
documents  or this chapter; against . . . any other person
who in any manner may use the property , shall be promptly
paid on demand to the association by such person or
persons[.] 
(Emphasis added.) 
Makana Aloha Plantation Association is an "association" 
within the meaning of HRS § 421J-10. See HRS § 421J-2 (2004). 
Iokepa Owners are persons "who in any manner may use the 
property" because they claimed a right to use an easement burdening the property and sought to invalidate the First Amendment to Makana Aloha Plantation Subdivision's Declaration. The 25% limitation of HRS § 607-14 does not apply to Makana Aloha Plantation Association's claim for attorneys fees under HRS § 421J-10.
(2) Makana Aloha Parties contend the circuit court 
erred "by reducing the costs award without adequate explanation." "The award of a taxable cost is within the discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed absent a clear abuse of discretion." Wong v. Takeuchi , 88 Hawai #i 46, 52, 961 P.2d 611, 
617 (1998) (citation omitted). 
"[T]he court may not deny costs 
to the prevailing party without explanation, unless the circumstances justifying denial of costs are plain from the record." Id. (citations omitted). 
Ashford & Wriston ( A&W) sought costs of $
10,768.78, 
based on costs actually paid by its clients. Its documentation shows $2,877.94 for "Westlaw-Research" but shows "0" paid by the clients. The Fee Order shows a "Deduction for Westlaw" of $2,877.94. This was error because the $10,768.78 amount claimed did not include the $2,877.94 that was not paid by the clients. The circuit court further reduced A&W's costs by $81.25, without

explanation. Iokepa Owners say that amount was "for mileage and 
service of [s]ubpoena." This cost is allowed under HRS § 607-8 (2016). The circuit court acted outside its discretion by reducing A&W's costs.
Case Lombardi & Pettit sought costs of $6,412.17. The 
circuit court reduced the costs by $9.00, without explanation. Iokepa Owners say the reduction was for general excise tax. Hawai#i general excise taxes are recoverable as costs under HRS 
§ 607-9 (2016). JST v. TAP, No. CAAP-20-0000014, 2021 WL 4026721, at *6 (Haw. App. Sept. 3, 2021) (SDO). The circuit court acted outside its discretion by reducing the Case firm's costs. 
Alan H. Tuhy sought costs of $445.26. The circuit 
court reduced the costs by $126.80, without explanation. Iokepa Owners say that $78.13 was for "Service Fees." This cost is allowed under HRS § 607-8. $33.00 was for copying documents from the Bureau of Conveyances. This cost is allowed under HRS § 607-9(b). The circuit court acted outside its discretion by making these reductions. But $15.67 was for Brickdata Document Service, a messenger service. That reduction was not error because messenger fees are not recoverable as costs. See Cnty. Of Haw. v. C&J Coupe Fam. Ltd. P'ship, 120 
Hawai#i 400, 409, 208 P.3d 
713, 722 (2009). 
Stephen D. Whittaker sought costs of $452.48. 
The 
circuit court awarded him no costs; it did not explain why. Iokepa Owners argue: "Mr. Whittaker's costs were not clear as to charges." That appears to be true as to many items on Exhibit 3 to the motion. "Print" appears many times; it is not clear whether this refers to the cost of copying the listed documents. "Transmittal" also appears many times; it is not clear whether this refers to the cost of postage. But copying and postage costs are recoverable under HRS § 607-9, and the words copy, 
copies, mail , and mailing appear 22 times in Exhibit 3. "Not 
only must the court explain its reasons for denying costs to the prevailing party, but the reasons given must also be adequate."

Wong, 88 Hawai #i at 52, 961 P.2d at 617 (citation omitted). The 
circuit court acted outside its discretion by awarding Whittaker 
no costs without explaining why in the Fee Order.

part as to paragraph nos. 1 and 3 and vacated in part as to paragraph no. 2. The December 4, 2019 Fee Order is vacated. This case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this summary disposition order.
