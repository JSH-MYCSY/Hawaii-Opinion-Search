SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, and Wadsworth and Guidry, JJ.) 
In this secondary appeal, Respondents-Appellees-
Appellants Planning Department of the County of Kaua# i (Planning
Department
), Planning Commission of the County of Kaua# i 
(Planning Commission), and County of Kaua# i (collectively
Appellants) appeal from the Second Amended Final Judgment 
(Judgment), entered in favor of Petitioner-Appellant-Appellee 
Kaua#i Springs, Inc. (Kaua# i Springs), on January 7, 2020, by the 
Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit (Circuit Court).1/ Appellants 
also challenge the Circuit Court's Findings of Fact, Conclusions 
of Law, Decision and Order (FOFs/COLs/Order), entered on 
November 1, 2019. The FOFs/COLs/Order "reverse[d] and vacate[d]" 
the Planning Commission's Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Decision and Order (Planning Commission FOFs/COLs/Order), 
issued on November 26, 2018. 
1/ The Honorable Kathleen N.A. Watanabe pesided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
On appeal, Appellants contend that: (1) "the Circuit 
Court's [COLs] 5, 6, 7 and 8 are clearly wrong"; (2) "the Circuit 
Court's [COLs] 4, 9, 10, 11 and 12 are clearly erroneous for lack of sufficient factual support"; and (3) "the Circuit Court's [FOFs] 19, 22, 23, 25, 27, and 28 are clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record." 
For the reasons discussed below, we vacate and remand. 
I. Background 
This agency appeal has a long and complex procedural 
history. The Hawai# i Supreme Court's published opinion in Kauai 
Springs, Inc. v. Planning Commission of the Cnty. of Kaua# i, 133 
Hawaii # 141, 324 P.3d 951 (2014), recounts the factual and 
procedural background of the case through early-2014. 
In brief, Kaua#i Springs filed an application with the 
Planning Department in 2006 for a Use Permit, a Class IV Zoning
Permit, and a Special Permit to continue operating a spring water 
bottling facility on a parcel of land within the County of Kaua# i 
that was zoned for agricultural use (collectively, the Permits). 
The Planning Commission denied Kaua# i Springs' application. 
Kaua#i Springs appealed to the Circuit Court. On September 17, 
2008, the Circuit Court issued findings of fact, conclusions of 
law, and an order reversing in part and vacating in part the Planning Commission order. The Circuit Court ruled that Kaua# i 
Springs had met its burden for the Permits and ordered that they be issued. On September 23, 2008, the Circuit Court entered final judgment in favor of Kaua# i Springs and against the 
Planning Commission. 
The Planning Commission appealed from the Circuit 
Court's judgment to this court. 
On April 30, 2013, this court 
published an opinion vacating the Circuit Court's judgment and remanding the case to the Planning Commission with instructions. 
See Kauai Springs, Inc. v. Planning Commission of the County of 
Kauai
, 130 Hawai#i 407, 312 P.3d 283 (App. 2013). 
The supreme court granted certiorari and issued its 
published opinion on February 28, 2014. See Kauai Springs
, 133

Hawai#i at 141, 324 P.3d at 951. The supreme court concluded 
that this court erred in certain respects, but affirmed this 
court's judgment to the extent it vacated the Circuit Court's judgment. Id. at 179-181, 324 P.3d at 989-91. Specifically, the 
supreme court held that the Planning Commission's findings of fact and conclusions of law were not wrong, and its decision to deny the Permits was thus not arbitrary and capricious. Id. at 
179-80, 324 P.3d at 989-90. However, the supreme court remanded the case to the Planning Commission with instructions to clarify its findings and conclusions in the underlying case consistent with the supreme court's opinion. See id. at 181, 324 P.3d at 
991. 
On remand, the Planning Commission referred the case to 
a hearings officer to "[r]eceive evidence consistent with the . . . [s]upreme [c]ourt [o]pinion to supplement the record" and to "[p]rovide an amended decision and order, based on the additional evidence, back to the Planning Commission for its consideration." On May 31, 2016, the hearings officer conducted a contested case hearing during which the Planning Department and Kaua#i Springs agreed that the Planning Commission had "reopened 
a contested case hearing[,]" under which the Commission "was not limited to clarifying its findings and conclusions" and could receive "further evidence . . . to permit [Kaua# i Springs] to 
establish that it presently meets the requirements for issuance of the Permits, including public trust and the respective requirements under each permit regime."
2/ Subsequent to the 
hearing, the record remained open for limited purposes; the contested case was closed on September 12, 2017. 
On November 26, 2018, the Planning Commission entered 
the Planning Commission FOFs/COLs/Order, which denied Kaua# i 
Springs' application for the Permits. 
2/ We note that the supreme court did not  instruct the Planning
Commission to reopen the proceeding to take additional evidence and to
determine anew whether Kaua #i Springs "presently," i.e., following the
submission and consideration of the additional evidence, met the requirements
for issuance of the Permits. That said, it does not appear that the PlanningCommission was legally precluded from doing so, as long as its new or amendedfindings and conclusions clarified its prior findings and conclusionsconsistent with the supreme court's opinion.

On December 21, 2018, Kaua# i Springs filed a notice of 
appeal in the Circuit Court seeking appellate review of the 
Planning Commission FOFs/COLs/Order pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 91-14(b) (Supp. 2019). 
Following briefing and a 
hearing, on November 1, 2019, the Circuit Court entered its FOFs/COLs/Order, which vacated the Planning Commission FOFs/COLs/Order and affirmatively directed the Planning Department to grant Kaua# i Springs' application for the Permits. 
On January 7, 2020, the Circuit Court entered the Judgment. 
II. Discussion 
In their first and second points of error, Appellants 
contend that the Circuit Court's COLs 5 through 8 are clearly wrong, and that COL 4 and COLs 9 through 12 are factually unsupported. In this secondary appeal, we apply the standards in HRS § 91–14(g) to the Planning Commission's decision to determine whether the Circuit Court was right or wrong in vacating the decision.
3/ Flores v. Bd. of Land & Nat. Res., 143 Hawai# i 114, 
120, 424 P.3d 469, 475 (2018). 
Appellants argue that the Circuit Court erred in 
concluding that Kaua# i Springs satisfied the public trust 
requirements for issuance of the Permits. We thus briefly review those requirements before addressing the challenged COLs. 
A. The Public Trust Doctrine 
The supreme court recently summarized the scope and 
purposes of the public trust doctrine as follows: 
"The public trust doctrine applies to all water
resources without exception or distinction." [In re Water 
Use Permit Apps. (Wai âhole I)], 94 Hawai #i [97,] 133, 9 P.3d
[409,] 445[ (2000)]. 
We have recognized four types of water uses, or
"purposes," protected by the state water resources trust: 
3/ In their third point of error, Appellants also challenge several
of the Circuit Court's FOFs. A circuit court reviewing an agency's decisionand order in a contested case under HRS § 91-14 acts as an appellate court; itdoes not review the evidence in the agency record to make its own findings offact. Sierra Club v. Bd. of Land & Nat. Res.
, 154 Hawai #i 264, 284, 550 P.3d
230, 250 (App. 2024), cert. granted, No. SCWC-22-0000516, 2024 WL 3378462(July 11, 2024). We d
ecline to review the Circuit Court's FOFs and instead 
analyze the issues presented by Appellants' arguments.

(1) maintenance of waters in their natural state; (2)
domestic water use, in particular, drinking water; (3) theexercise of traditional and customary Native Hawaiian waterrights; and (4) the reservation of water enumerated by theWater Code. Kauai Springs, 133 Hawai #i at 172, 324 P.3d at
982 (first citing Wai âhole I, 94 Hawai #i at 136-37, 9 P.3d
at 448-50; and then citing In re Wai #ola[ O Moloka #i, Inc.],
103 Hawai #i
 [401,] 431, 83 P.3d [664,] 694[ (2004)]). We 
rejected, on the other hand, private commercial uses as notprotected by the public trust. Waiâhole I, 94 Hawai #i at 
138, 9 P.3d at 450. We have acknowledged the public trust"may allow grants of private interests in trust resourcesunder certain circumstances"; nonetheless, it has "neverbeen understood to safeguard rights of exclusive use forprivate commercial gain." Id. 
Surface Water Use Permit Applications, Integration of Appurtenant 
Rts. & Amends. to Interim Instream Flow Standards, 154 Hawai# i 
309, 339, 550 P.3d 1167, 1197 (2024). 
In Kauai Springs, the supreme court explained the 
duties of the State in enforcing these public trust principles, as well as the burden on the permit applicant, in the context of this case. The court stated in part: 
When an agency is confronted with its duty to perform
as a public trustee under the public trust doctrine, it must
preserve the rights of present and future generations in thewaters of the state." Waiâhole I, 94 Hawai #i at 141, 9 P.3d
at 453. . . . The agency measures the proposed use under a"reasonable and beneficial use" standard, which requiresexamination of the proposed use in relation to other publicand private uses. 
Id. at 161, 9 P.3d at 473. The agency
must apply a presumption in favor of public use, access,enjoyment, and resource protection. Id. at 142, 154 n. 59, 9P.3d at 454, 466 n. 59. 
The agency is duty-bound to place the burden on the
applicant to justify the proposed water use in light of thetrust purposes. [In re Contested Case Hearing on Water UsePermit Application Filed by] Kukui (Molokai), Inc., 116Hawai #i
 [481,] 490, 174 P.3d [320,] 329[ (2007)]. Permit 
applicants must demonstrate their actual needs, and, withinthe constraints of available knowledge, the propriety ofdraining water from public streams to satisfy those needs.Waiâhole I, 94 
Hawai #i at 162, 9 P.3d at 474. If there is a 
reasonable allegation of harm to one of the uses protectedby the public trust, then the applicant must demonstratethat there is no harm in fact or that any potential harmdoes not preclude a finding that the requested use isnevertheless reasonable and beneficial. Kukui (Molokai),Inc., 116 Hawai i # at 499, 174 P.3d at 338. 
The applicant is "obligated to demonstrate
affirmatively that the proposed use will not affect aprotected use, in other words, the absence of evidence thatthe proposed use would affect a protected use isinsufficient." 
Wai #ola O Moloka #i, 103 Hawai #i at 442, 83
P.3d at 705 (emphases in original). See also Kukui (Molokai), Inc., 116 Hawai #i at 509, 174 P.3d at 348 ("The
Water Commission's conclusion that 'no evidence was 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
presented' . . . that the protected use would be adversely
affected erroneously shifted the burden of proof.") 
Additionally, the applicant must demonstrate the
absence of a practicable alternative water source. Waiâhole 
I, 94 Hawai #i at 161, 9 P.3d at 473. The applicant's
proposed use must be denied if the applicant does not showthat there is no practicable alternative water source. 
Id. 
at 161 n. 65, 9 P.3d at 473 n. 65. "Such a requirement isintrinsic to the public trust." Id.; see also Kukui (Molokai), Inc., 116 Hawai #i at 496, 174 P.3d at 335 ("The
agency cannot fairly balance competing interests in a scarcepublic trust resource if it renders its decision prior toevaluating the availability of alternative sources ofwater."). 
Lastly, if the impact is found to be reasonable and
beneficial, then in light of the cumulative impact ofexisting and proposed diversions on trust purposes, theapplicant must implement reasonable measures to mitigatethis impact. Waiâhole I, 94 Hawai i # at 143, 161, 9 P.3d at
455, 473. 
When an agency or other deciding body considers an
application for permits under circumstances that requiresthe deciding body to perform as a public trustee to protecta public trust resource, the agency or other deciding bodymust make findings sufficient to enable an appellate courtto track the steps that the agency took in reaching itsdecision. Kilauea Neighborhood Ass'n[ v. Land Use Comm'n],7 Haw. App. [277,] 230, 751 P.2d [1031,] 1034[ (1988)]. . . . 
. . . . 
Under the foregoing principles and purposes of the
public trust, it is manifest that a government body isprecluded from allowing an applicant's proposed use toimpact the public trust in the absence of an affirmativeshowing that the use does not conflict with those principlesand purposes. Therefore, the applicant is "obligated todemonstrate affirmatively that the proposed use will notaffect a protected use,"
 Wai #ola O Moloka #i, 103 Hawai #i at 
442, 83 P.3d at 705 (emphases omitted). 
In other words,
"the absence of evidence that the proposed use would affecta protected use is insufficient." Id. (emphasis added).Kauai Springs has asserted "the public trust doctrineimposes a duty to assess, but does not empower an agency todeny an application simply because it claims it lacksinformation within its power to obtain, thus shifting theburden to the applicant." However, contrary to KauaiSprings' assertion, a lack of information from the applicantis exactly the reason an agency is empowered to deny aproposed use of a public trust resource. 
Kauai Springs, 133 Hawai# i at 173-74, 324 P.3d at 983-84 
(original brackets omitted). 
With these principles in mind, we address Appellants' 
contentions.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
B. The Challenged COLs 
Appellants first contend that the Circuit Court's COLs 
5 through 8 are clearly wrong. These COLs state: 
5. There has been no actual evidence to indicate 
that [Kaua i # Springs'] property and/or the water that flows
through [Kaua #i
 Springs'] property, was ever used by Native
Hawaiian practitioners. See In re Conservation Dist. Use 
Application (CDUA) HA-3568, 431 P.3d 752, 769-70 (Haw.
2018). 
6. There has been no specific findings of fact and
conclusions of law by the Planning Department or thePlanning Commission "identifying (1) the scope of valuedcultural, historical or natural resources in the relevantarea, (2) the extent to which those resources will beaffected or impaired, and (3) any feasible actions to betaken by the agency to protect Native Hawaiian rights thatare found to exist at the relevant area." In re 
Conservation Dist. Use Application (CDUA) HA-3568, 431 P.3d752, 769-70 (Haw. 2018). 
7. The reservation of water enumerated by the State
Water Code, which generally refers to: (i) the reservationof sufficient water for current and foreseeable domestic,stock water, aquaculture and irrigation activities on landsleased to native Hawaiians pursuant to the HHCA, (ii) thereservation of appurtenant water rights of kuleana and tarolands, and (iii) those traditional and customary rightsotherwise assured under the code (
See In re W[ai #]ola O
Moloka[ #]i, Inc. , 103 Haw[ai #i] 401, 431 (2004)) will not be
affected by [
Kaua #i Springs'] proposed use. 
8. Therefore, [Kaua #i Springs'] proposed use is
consistent with the four (4) protected trust purposesenumerated by the Hawaii Supreme Court in Kauai Springs,Inc. v. Planning Comm'n of Cty of Kauai, 133 Haw. 141,(2014), to wit: (i) the maintenance of waters in theirnatural state; (ii) the protection of domestic water use;(iii)
 the protection of water in the exercise of Native
Hawaiian and traditional and customary rights; and (iv) thereservation of water enumerated by the State Water Code. 
COLs 5 and 6, when read together with COLs 7 and 8, 
appear to conclude that Kaua#i Springs met its burden of 
demonstrating that its proposed water use will not affect the 
protected use of water in the exercise of Native Hawaiian and traditional and customary rights, because (1) there was "no actual evidence to indicate that [Kaua# i Springs'] property, 
and/or the water that flows through [Kaua# i Springs'] property, 
was ever used by Native Hawaiian practitioners"; and (2) the Planning Commission did not properly conduct an analysis under Ka Pa#akai O Ka # Aina v. Land Use Comm'n, 94 Hawai# i 31, 7 P.3d 1068 
(2000), consistent with the supreme court's ruling in In re 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Conservation Dist. Use Application HA-3568, 143 Hawai# i 379, 431 
P.3d 752 (2018). 
So read, COLs 5 through 8 are clearly wrong in their 
application of the legal standards set forth in Kauai Springs. 
"If there is a reasonable allegation of harm to one of the uses protected by the public trust" – here, the use of water in the exercise of Native Hawaiian and traditional and customary rights – "then the applicant must demonstrate that there is no harm in fact or that any potential harm does not preclude a finding that the requested use is nevertheless reasonable and beneficial. 
133 
Hawai#i at 173, 324 P.3d at 983 (emphasis added) (citing Kukui 
(Molokai), Inc., 116 
Hawai#i at 399, 174 P.3d at 338). "The 
applicant is obligated to demonstrate affirmatively that the proposed use will not affect a protected use, in other words, the absence of evidence that the proposed use would affect a protected use is insufficient." Id. (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted; some emphasis added) (quoting In re Wai# ola 
O Moloka# i, 103 Hawai# i at 442, 83 P.3d at 705). 
Here, the Planning Commission concluded that "a 
reasonable allegation of harm was evidenced in the record" in part by testimony that "raised concerns over the resulting harm to Native Hawaiian traditional and customary rights and the maintenance of waters in [their] natural state that may sustain downstream flora, fauna, and riparian and coastal ecosytems." Planning Commission COLs 60-61. The Planning Commission summarized some of this testimony in COL 62 and there is more in the record. 
The Planning Commission further concluded that 
"[Kaua#i Springs] presented no evidence to demonstrate that there 
is no harm in fact to the exercise of Native Hawaiian and traditional and customary rights or the maintenance of waters in [their] natural state, or that the requested use was nevertheless reasonable and beneficial." Planning Commission COL 63. 
Substantial evidence supported the Planning 
Commission's COLs 60-63 (as well as the related FOFs) and they reflect an application of the correct legal standard. 
The 
Circuit Court did not expressly rule otherwise. Instead, the Circuit Court erroneously concluded that 
Kaua#i Springs met its 
8   
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
burden based on an absence of evidence that Native Hawaiian 
practitioners ever used Kaua# i Springs' property or the water 
that flowed through it, and the absence of a related Ka Pa# akai 
analysis. These conclusions do not reflect application of the correct legal standard, as set forth in Kauai Springs.
4/ See also 
Wai#ola O Moloka# i, 103 Hawai# i at 442, 83 P.3d at 705 (where 
intervenor Native Hawaiians presented evidence that they traditionally and customarily gathered food and fish along the Kamiloloa shoreline and that a private developer's proposed well and related pumping would significantly reduce groundwater discharge into the ocean, thereby adversely affecting the limu growth and fish populations, the developer "was obligated to demonstrate affirmatively
 that the proposed well would not affect 
native Hawaiians' rights; in other words, the absence of evidence that the proposed use would affect native Hawaiians' rights was insufficient to meet the burden imposed upon [the developer] by the public trust doctrine . . . ."); Kukui (Molokai), Inc., 116 Hawai#i
 at 509, 174 P.3d at 348 (where intervenors contended that 
a private landowner's proposed diversion of well water could result in a reduction of marine life that would diminish their ability to practice their traditional and customary native Hawaiian gathering rights, even if their access was not impaired, "the Commission's conclusion that 'no evidence was presented' to suggest that the rights of native Hawaiians would be adversely affected erroneously shifted the burden of proof to [the intervenors]"). COLs 5 through 8 are clearly wrong. 
Furthermore, because Kaua# i Springs did not meet its 
burden under the public trust doctrine, COLs 11 and 12
5/ are, by 
4/ We further conclude that although the Planning Commission was
required to "make findings sufficient to enable an appellate court to track
the steps that the agency took in reaching its decision[,]" Kauai Springs, 133Hawai #i at 173, 324 P.3d at 983, it was not required to conduct a complete Ka 
Pa#akai analysis in this context, where Kaua i # Springs failed to meet its
affirmative burden to demonstrate that its proposed use would not affect theprotected use of water in the exercise of Native Hawaiian and traditional andcustomary rights, and the Commission denied the Permits on that basis. 
5/ COLs 11 and 12 state: 
11. [Kaua #i Springs's] proposed use of the water
flowing in the Waihohonu Stream is a reasonable, beneficial 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
extension, also wrong. We need not reach Appellants' remaining 
contentions regarding COLs 4, 9, and 10. 
III. Conclusion
