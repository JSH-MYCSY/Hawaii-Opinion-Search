APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 2CC151000224(3)) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: 
Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
appellate jurisdiction over Defendant-Appellant Herma B. Medina 
Reyna's (Medina Reyna) appeal in case number CAAP-20-0000012 from 
the Honorable Joseph E. Cardoza's (1) December 10, 2019 order 
granting commissioner's motion to conduct auction without holding 
open houses, and (2) December 10, 2019 order denying Medina 
Reyna's motion for reconsideration of the order granting 
commissioner's motion to conduct auction without holding open 
houses. These two interlocutory orders in the ongoing 
foreclosure proceeding, Civil No. 15-1-0224(3), are not yet 
eligible for appellate review. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
When an aggrieved party desires to assert an appeal in 
a foreclosure case, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 667-51(a) 
(2016) authorizes the party to assert an appeal from three 
different parts of the foreclosure case: 
§667-51 Appeals. (a) Without limiting the class of
orders not specified in section 641-1 from which appeals may
also be taken, the following orders entered in a foreclosurecase shall be final and appealable: 
(1) A judgment entered on a decree of foreclosure,and if the judgment incorporates an order ofsale or an adjudication of a movant's right to adeficiency judgment, or both, then the order ofsale or the adjudication of liability for thedeficiency judgment also shall be deemed finaland appealable; 
(2) A judgment entered on an order confirming thesale of the foreclosed property, if the circuitcourt expressly finds that no just reason fordelay exists, and certifies the judgment asfinal pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Hawaii Rulesof Civil Procedure; and 
(3) A deficiency judgment; provided that no appealfrom a deficiency judgment shall raise issuesrelating to the judgment debtor’s liability forthe deficiency judgment (as opposed to theamount of the deficiency judgment), nor shallthe appeal affect the finality of the transferof title to the foreclosed property pursuant tothe order confirming sale. 
(b) An appeal shall be taken in the manner and within
the time provided by the rules of court. 
(Emphases added). Pursuant to HRS § 667-51(a)(1), the circuit 
court's July 20, 2017 judgment on the decree of foreclosure was 
immediately appealable, but the thirty-day period under 
Rule 4(a)(1) of the Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 
for asserting an appeal from that judgment has already expired. 
Furthermore, in this appeal, Medina Reyna does not 
appeal from a judgment regarding confirming the sale of the foreclosed property, as set out in HRS § 667-51(a)(2). 
Absent a 
judgment on an order confirming the sale of the foreclosed property, pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Hawai# i Rules of Civil 
Procedure, the two December 10, 2019 orders are not yet eligible

for appellate review. Medina Reyna's appeal is premature and 
this court lacks appellate jurisdiction. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that case number CAAP-
20-0000012 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
