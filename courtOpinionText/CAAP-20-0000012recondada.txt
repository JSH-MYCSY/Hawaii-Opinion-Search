(2) Defendant-Appellant Herma B. Medina Reyna's (Medina Reyna) 
"Motion for Reconsideration of Court Order Denying [Medina 
Reyna's] Jurisdiction on the Case," filed on June 28, 2020, which 
she contends is brought pursuant to a "Rule 60.1 of the Hawai# i 
Rules of Civil Procedure," but which we construe as a motion for reconsideration under Rule 40 of the Hawai# i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP), and (3) the record, it appears that we did not   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
overlook or misapprehend any points of law or fact when we 
entered the June 17, 2020 dismissal order. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that, pursuant to HRAP 
Rule 40, Medina Reyna's June 28, 2020 motion for reconsideration 
of the June 17, 2020 dismissal order is denied.1

1 As set forth in the "Order Dismissing Appeal for Lack of Appellate
Jurisdiction," filed on June 17, 2020, Medina Reyna seeks to appeal from an
order granting commissioner's motion to conduct auction without holding openhouses and an order denying Medina Reyna's motion for reconsideration of thatorder. We note that on June 26, 2020, the 
Hawai #i Supreme Court issued an
"Order Regarding Foreclosure or Non-Judicial Foreclosure Related Actions:Certification of Compliance with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and EconomicSecurity Act in Foreclosures," which the parties may wish to address at theappropriate time in the Circuit Court.
