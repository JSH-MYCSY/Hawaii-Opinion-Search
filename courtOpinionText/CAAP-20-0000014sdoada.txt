JST, Petitioner-Appellee,
v. 
TAP, Respondent-Appellant
and 
CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT AGENCY,
STATE OF HAWAII, Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(FC-P NO. 18-1-6331) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Respondent-Appellant TAP (Father) appeals from the 
"
Order Awarding Petitioner's Attorney's 
Fees and Costs" entered 
by the Family Court of the First Circuit on December 9, 2019.1 
For the reasons explained below, we affirm the Order Awarding 
Fees and Costs. 
Father and Petitioner-Appellee JST (Mother) are the 
natural parents of Child.  Child was born in Texas in 2016. In 
July 2018 Mother and Child moved to Hawai# i, where Mother's 
family lives. On August 30, 2018, Mother filed a petition for an 
order for protection against Father in 
Hawai# i. 
On September 6, 2018, Mother filed (1) a petition for 
custody, visitation, and support orders; and (2) a Motion for 
1 The Honorable Na #unanikina #u Kamali #i  presided.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Emergency Jurisdiction in Hawai# i family court. The issue of 
jurisdiction was resolved by order entered on October 19, 2018.2 
Father agreed to withdraw his pending Texas proceeding involving 
Child. Mother agreed to withdraw her petition for protective order. Child was to remain in Mother's care. 
A stipulated judgment of paternity and order regarding 
custody, visitation, and support was entered on January 8, 2019. Father stipulated to paternity; Mother was awarded temporary legal and physical custody of Child, pending a trial set for May 13, 2019. 
Mother filed a motion to compel discovery from Father 
on March 18, 2019. Mother filed a motion to strike Father's witness list and for sanctions against Father on March 22, 2019. On March 29, 2019, the family court issued orders granting in part Mother's motion to compel discovery and denying Mother's motion to strike Father's witness list.
3 The issue of sanctions 
was reserved. 
A trial was held on May 13, 2019.4 On June 5, 2019, 
the family court issued the "Order re: May 13, 2019 Hearing[.]" Among other things, the family court awarded sole legal and physical custody of Child to Mother, with Father awarded supervised visitation rights. The order did not address payment of attorneys' fees or costs or Mother's prior request for sanctions. 
On June 26, 2019, Mother filed the motion for 
attorneys' fees and costs at issue in this appeal. Father opposed the motion. On October 7, 2019, the family court entered an order granting in part Mother's request for attorneys' fees and costs. Mother's motion was granted: 
2 The Honorable Steven M. Nakashima presided. 
3 Judge Nakashima signed the orders. 
4 The Honorable Gale L.F. Ching presided over the trial.

 regarding [Mother's] Motion to Compel & enforcement of
discovery production, the preparation, filing & litigationof Petitioner's Emergency Motion regarding jurisdiction andthe filing & litigation of the Motion requesting fees (feesrelated to the Motion for fees are subject to the court'sevaluation of amount of reasonable costs related to grantedrelief[)]. . . . 
. . . . 
[Mother]'s request for fees regarding issues of
custody & child support are denied. 
Mother's counsel was directed to submit a declaration of fees 
with redacted billing statements reflecting the amounts requested. 
Mother's counsel timely submitted a declaration and 
exhibits, including 29 pages of billing statements that were "redacted as necessary to protect attorney-client privilege and/or remove non-chargeable events." Mother requested attorneys' fees and costs totaling $16,422.79. Father submitted a timely opposition. In response, Mother's counsel submitted a supplemental declaration. The Order Awarding Fees and Costs was entered on December 9, 2019. The family court awarded $16,422.79 (the total amount requested), and entered findings of fact and conclusions of law on June 17, 2020. This appeal followed. 
Father contends that the family court erred when it:
(1) awarded Mother attorneys' fees and costs with respect to her 
Motion for Emergency Jurisdiction; (2) awarded Mother attorneys' 
fees and costs to the extent that the fees and costs pertained to 
litigation of the issues of child custody or child support; and(3) awarded Mother costs in the form of reimbursement for Hawai# i 
general excise tax, legal intern expenses, and paralegal expenses. 
Father's statement of the points of error does not 
designate any of the family court's findings of fact as error. Findings of fact that are not specified as error pursuant to Rule 28(b)(4)(C) of the Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(HRAP)5 are binding on the appellate court. Bremer v. Weeks, 104 
Hawai# i 43, 63, 85 P.3d 150, 170 (2004). "If a finding [of fact] 
is not properly attacked, it is binding; and any conclusion [of 
law] which follows from it and is a correct statement of law is valid." Kawamata Farms, Inc. v. United Agri Prods., 86 Hawai# i 
214, 252, 948 P.2d 1055, 1093 (1997), as amended (Jan. 13, 2004) (citation omitted). 
We review conclusions of law under the "right/wrong" 
standard. Est. of Klink ex rel. Klink v. State, 113 Hawai# i 332, 
351, 152 P.3d 504, 523 (2007). A conclusion of law that is supported by the trial court's findings of fact and reflects an application of the correct rule of law will not be overturned. Id. When a conclusion of law presents mixed questions of fact 
and law, we review it under the "clearly erroneous" standard because the court's conclusions are dependent on the facts and circumstances of each individual case. Id. 
(1) Father contends that the family court erred when 
it awarded Mother attorneys' fees and costs with respect to her Motion for Emergency Jurisdiction. 
Mother moved for attorneys' 
fees and costs under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS
) § 584-16 
5 HRAP Rule 28 provides, in relevant part: 
(b) Opening brief . Within 40 days after the filing
of the record on appeal, the appellant shall file an opening
brief, containing the following sections in the order hereindicated: 
. . . . 
(4) A concise statement of the points of error set
forth in separately numbered paragraphs. 
Each point shall
state: (i) the alleged error committed by the court oragency; (ii) where in the record the alleged error occurred;and (iii) where in the record the alleged error was objectedto or the manner in which the alleged error was brought tothe attention of the court or agency. Where applicable,each point shall also include the following: 
. . . . 
(C) when the point involves a finding or conclusion
of the court or agency, either a quotation of the finding orconclusion urged as error or reference to appended findingsand conclusions[.] 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2018), part of the Hawai# i Uniform Parentage Act. The statute 
provides, in relevant part: 
§ 584-16 Costs . The court may order reasonable fees
of counsel, experts, and the child's guardian ad litem, and
other costs of the action and pre-trial proceedings,including genetic tests, subject to the provisions ofsection 584-11(f) [concerning contested genetic testingresults], to be paid by the parties in proportions and attimes determined by the court. 
The purpose of the statute is to apportion the costs of suit. 
Doe v. Roe, 5 Haw. App. 558, 571, 705 P.2d 535, 545 (1985). The family court is given broad discretion to award attorney's fees and costs under the statute; the award will not be disturbed on appeal if the record discloses adequate showing of reasonableness of the award. Doe VI v. Roe VI, 6 Haw. App. 629, 644, 736 P.2d 
448, 458 (1987). Father, as appellant, "bears the burden of convincing this court from the record that the lower court abused its discretion." Doe, 5 Haw. App. at 572-73, 705 P.2d at 546 
(citations omitted). 
Mother's Motion for Emergency Jurisdiction was 
authorized under HRS § 583A-204 (2006), part of the Hawai# i 
Uniform Child-Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act. The statute provides, in relevant part: 
§ 583A-204 Temporary emergency jurisdiction . (a) A
court of this State has temporary emergency jurisdiction if
the child is present in this State and the child has beenabandoned or it is necessary in an emergency to protect thechild because the child, or a sibling or parent of thechild, is subjected to or threatened with mistreatment orabuse. 
(Underscoring added.) 
The family court made the following findings of fact
which, being unchallenged, are binding on us and the parties:  
20. After considering the evidence at trial,
credible witness testimony and the written closing argumentsof the parties, and in the best interest of the child, thetrial Court entered its Order Re: May 13, 2019 Hearing,filed June 5, 2019. The Court found in [Mother]'s favor andgranted all requested relief, including, but not limited to,entering its findings and orders as follows that: 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
a. Defendant had committed acts of family
violence against [Mother.] 
. . . . 
21. [Mother] was the prevailing party on all issues
raised at trial. 
22. [Mother]'s income was $
1,375.00 per month and
this income was uncontested by [Father]. 
23. [Father]'s income was determined by the Court to
be $9,931.00 per month. 
The family court then entered the following conclusions
of law:  
2. Hawaii Revised Statutes "(HRS)" §584-16,
pertains to paternity actions[.] . . . 
. . . . 
4. HRS § 584-16 specifically deals with paternity
cases and the potential financial burden that one party may
have to incur as a result of litigating a case even wherethe party is indigent and fees and costs cost are to be paidto the State, or such persons as the Court shall direct. 
. . . . 
6. In determining whether the award of attorney's
fees was reasonable, the Court considered the totality of
the circumstances, including that [Mother] prevailed on allof her requests, the financial resources of [Mother], whoearned $1,375.00 per month and [Father], who earned$9,931.00 per month and determined that [Mother] sufferedfinancially to litigate the issue of jurisdiction , enforce
Court's orders, enforce her discovery requests and seek feesand costs regarding: (a) fees and costs related to[Mother]'s Motion to Compel and enforcement of discoveryproduction, (b) fees and costs related to [Mother]'s filing
and litigation of her Emergency Motion regardingjurisdiction and the Petition for Paternity ; (c) fees and
costs related to Petitioner's filing and litigation of herMotion requesting fees and costs. 
(Emphasis added.) The family court did not abuse its discretion 
because it applied the correct law to the unchallenged facts. See Klink, 113 Hawai# i at 351, 152 P.3d at 523. 
Father argued below, as he does on appeal, that 
Mother's attorneys' fee award should be precluded by Cox v. Cox, 138 Hawai# i 476, 382 P.3d 288 (2016). In Cox, a majority of the 
supreme court held that the attorneys' fee and cost provisions of 
6  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Rule 68 of the Hawai# i Family Court Rules (HFCR)6 do not apply to 
family court cases governed by HRS § 580–47 (Supp. 2011).7 Id. 
at 478, 382 P.3d at 290. The family court concluded: 
8. [Father]'s argument regarding attorneys' fees,
relying on Cox v. Cox, 138 Haw. [sic] 476, 382 P.3d 288
(2016), a divorce case, is misplaced. The instant case, apaternity matter under HRS Chapter 584, is distinguishedfrom the Court's holding in Cox, in that the Courtconsidered an award of attorney's fees pursuant to HRSChapter 580, which applies to divorce cases and opined onsettlement offers made pursuant to Hawaii [sic] Family CourtRules (HFCR), Rule 68, which contravenes HRS § 580-47 (trialcourt's discretion to award of attorney's fees and costs indivorce). Comparatively, the award of attorneys' fees andcosts in paternity matters is made pursuant to HRS § 584-16and applicable law. 
We agree with the family court that Cox has no bearing on this 
case — a paternity case under HRS Chapter 584 — which deals with neither HFCR Rule 68 nor HRS § 580–47.
(2) Father contends that the family court erred by 
awarding Mother attorneys' fees and costs to the extent that the fees and costs pertained to litigation of the issues of child custody or child support. The family court specifically concluded: 
13. Charges for work performed on the Petition for
Paternity relating to the issues of custody and child
support were denied . In consideration of the totality of
the circumstances, it is fair, equitable and reasonable thateach party pay for [their] own attorneys' fees and costs. 
(Emphasis added.) 
6 HFCR Rule 68 "mandate[s] an award of costs, including reasonable
attorney's fees, to a party who offers to settle certain classes of familycourt cases in the amount or upon the terms specified in the offer, if theoffer is refused by the offeree and 'the judgment in its entirety finallyobtained by the offeree is patently not more favorable than the offer, unlessthe court shall specifically determine that such would be inequitable.'" Cox,
138 Hawai #i at 478, 382 P.3d at 290. 
7 HRS § 580–47 deals with child and spousal support orders in
divorce cases, and "directs the family court to determine the equity andjustice of awarding attorney's fees based on a multifactor analysis in thecourse of deciding whether to award such fees." Cox, 138 Hawai #i at 481, 382
P.3d at 293. 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Father argues that the attorneys' fees incurred by 
Mother in connection with the Motion for Emergency Jurisdiction 
are indivisible from those incurred in connection with child custody and child support issues, which were denied by the familycourt. For each billing entry at issue, we quote Father's argument to the family court, the billing entry at issue, Mother's response, and the family court's conclusion.
 8 
Father's argument: 
4. The August 29, 2018 billing entry pertains to general
intake and does not reference the Motion for EmergencyJurisdiction. 
Billing entry: 
Aug-29-18 Review and evaluate notes from consultation meeting with client; Draft summary instructionemail to team. 
Review and evaluate client's response email and
attachments supporting allegations of abuse;Forward to team with instructions for further action. 
Mother's response: 
5. Regarding paragraph 4 of [Father]'s Opposition,
the August 29, 2018 billing entry was necessary for [Mother]to be able to file [Mother's] Motion for EmergencyJurisdiction ("[Mother]'s Motion for EmergencyJurisdiction") and, as such, this expense is recoverable. 
Family court's conclusion: 
15. The August 29, 2018 billing entry regarding
general intake is recoverable based on the relevant facts inthe file that show the underlying facts regarding her Motionfor Emergency Jurisdiction were based on her allegations ofabuse, the initial basis for her filing her Protective OrderPetition. 
Conclusion of law no. 15 is a mixed finding of fact and 
conclusion of law. To the extent it found facts, it is binding. 
8 Father's opening brief argues that additional time entries were
indivisible and should not have been allowed, but we decline to address thembecause Father raises them for the first time on appeal. See HRS § 641-2
(2016) (stating that the "appellate court . . . need not consider a point thatwas not presented in the trial court in an appropriate manner."). 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Kawamata Farms, 86 Hawai# i at 252, 948 P.2d at 1093. The family 
court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that Mother, the 
prevailing party in the Motion for Emergency Jurisdiction, was entitled to an award of attorneys' fees under HRS § 584-16 for the August 29, 2018 billing entry. 
Father's argument: 
5. The August 30, 2018 billing entry pertains in part to
the Petition for Paternity. 
Billing entry: 
Aug-30-18 Draft Petition for Paternity, draft Motion forEmergency Declaration, draft Memorandum inSupport of Motion; draft decalration [sic] ofclient to attach to Emergency Motion. 
Mother's response: 
6. Regarding paragraph 5 of [Father]'s Opposition,
the August 30, 2018 billing entry refers only in part to[Mother]'s Petition for Paternity . . . and the preparationand filing of the Paternity Petition was necessary for[Mother] to proceed with [Mother's] Motion for EmergencyJurisdiction. Moreover, the drafting of the Petition forPaternity was a nominal event for that billing entry. 
Family court's conclusion: 
16. The August 30, 2018 billing entry is recoverable
because notwithstanding the reference in part to thePetition for Paternity, the Petition is legally necessary inorder to have a case in which to file a Motion for EmergencyJurisdiction and also pertains to matters other than custodyand visitation. 
Conclusion of law no. 16 is also a mixed finding and 
conclusion. There was no error in concluding that Mother was 
entitled to an award of attorneys' fees under HRS § 584-16 for the August 30, 2018 billing entry. Mother's counsel representedthat "the drafting of the Petition for Paternity was a nominal event for that billing entry." In awarding attorneys' fees in acase involving multiple claims, some for which attorneys' fees are recoverable and some for which they are not, "a court must  
 
base its award of fees, if practicable, on an apportionment of 
the fees claimed between [recoverable] and [non-recoverable] 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
claims." Blair v. Ing, 96 Hawai# i 327, 332, 31 P.3d 184, 189 
(2001) (citation omitted). Conclusion of law no. 16 was not an 
abuse of discretion. 
Father's argument: 
6. The September 5, 2018 billing entry pertains in part
to the TRO hearing and Petition for Paternity. 
Billing entry: 
Sep-05-18 Review and revise exhibits for TRO hearingprepared by Caitlin Axe; Instruct on additionalpotential exhibits to include in motion. 
Review and finalize Petition for Paternity,
Motion for Emergency Jurisdiction, meet withclient to execute the same. Answer client's questions regarding recent contact from opposingparty's Texas attorney. Review and finalize Ex Parte Motion to Shorten Time on Motion for Emergency Jurisdiction. 
Telephone call with [Mother's counsel]. Met 
with client regarding status of service on TRO.Prepare check requests and prepare documents tobe submitted to go to court for filing. 
Mother's response: 
7. Regarding paragraph 6 of [Father]'s Opposition,
the September 5, 2018 billing entry pertains to the hearingon [Mother]'s Petition for an Order for Protection("[Mother]'s Protective Order Petition") and [Mother]'sPaternity Petition. These hearings were consolidated with[Mother]'s Motion for Emergency Jurisdiction and areinextricably linked since the allegation in the ProtectiveOrder Petition were the basis for the Motion for Jurisdiction and the Paternity Petition was required for theMotion for Emergency Jurisdiction to be heard. 
Family court's conclusion: 
17. The September 5, 2018 billing entry is
recoverable because the hearing on [Mother]'s Motion forEmergency Jurisdiction was consolidated with the TRO hearingand Petition for Paternity and is indivisible in terms oflegal work performed. 
Conclusion of law no. 17, a mixed finding and 
conclusion, was not erroneous because to the extent fees relating
to custody and child support may have been reflected in the August 29 and 30 and September 5, 2018 billing entries, the fee  
10 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
award was not an abuse of discretion because the family court 
found that it was not practicable to apportion the time at issue. Blair, 96 Hawai# i at 332, 31 P.3d at 189. 
(3) Father contends that the family court erred when 
it awarded Mother costs in the form of (a) reimbursement for Hawai# i general excise tax, (b) legal intern expenses, and 
(c) paralegal expenses. The family court concluded: 
9. G.E.T. taxes on attorney's fees and costs are
reasonable and recoverable under HRS § 607-9. See Doe v. 
Roe, 5 Haw. App. 558, 705 P.2d, [sic] 525 [sic] (1985)
(stating that because HRS § 584-16 does not include specificcosts, the Court held that it would "analogize HRS § 584-16to HRS § [sic] 607 since they are in pari materia and [theCourt] would consider cases construing the latter statute todecide the issue of fees and costs.")[.] 
10. Charges for work performed by a legal intern are
reasonable and recoverable under HRS § 607-9 as a reasonablepart of Petitioner's attorney's fees and costs. See First 
Ins. Co. of Hawaii, Ltd. v. Daoan [sic], 124 Haw. [sic] 426,437 (2010). 
11. Charges for work performed by paralegals are
reasonable and recoverable under HRS § 607-9 as a reasonablepart of Petitioner's attorney's fees and costs. See Id. 
[sic] at [sic] 437. 
Conclusion no. 9 was not wrong. HRS § 584-16 does not 
specify what costs are included in "other costs of the action and 
pre-trial proceedings." In Doe, 5 Haw. App. 558, 705 P.2d 535, we analogized HRS § 584–16 to HRS Chapter 607 because they are in pari materia, and considered cases construing the latter statute to decide what fees and costs were recoverable under the former. Id. at 570 n.11, 705 P.2d at 545 n.11. Hawai# i general excise 
taxes are recoverable as costs under HRS § 607-9. See Blair, 96 
Hawai# i at 336, 31 P.3d at 193. 
Conclusion nos. 10 and 11 were also not wrong. See 
Blair, 96 Hawai# i at 336, 31 P.3d at 193 ("[A] request or award 
of attorneys' fees may, in appropriate cases, include compensation for separately billed legal services performed by a paralegal, legal assistant, or law clerk . . . for work performed that would otherwise have been required to be performed by a 
11 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
licensed attorney at a higher rate[.]"). The family court 
cautioned Mother's counsel: 
So . . . in submitting your calculation of fees, please look
at all the considerations in the court's calculation of that: duplication; the way in which people use paralegals todo work that really are [sic] just secretarial work; all ofthat that otherwise would be included in what your fee is asopposed to how much time you spent. Okay. 
I've had to reject one case because it was just sort
of everything was thrown in and there was no time spentgleaning over the bill as to what really are attorney's feesand costs. 
The family court properly recognized the distinction between 
delegating work to a paralegal that would otherwise have to be performed by an attorney, and delegating non-billable secretarialwork to a paralegal so that it could be billed.  
Based upon the foregoing, we affirm the family court's 
"Order Awarding Petitioner's Attorney's Fees and Costs" entered on December 9, 2019.
