  Drink raises seven points of error on appeal (POEs 1 
through 7),4 contending as follows:  
[1]. The Trial Court Reversibly Erred by having a non-
consensual exparte [sic] settlement conference, when it knew that 
a party with settlement authority was not present. 
 
[2]. The Trial Court Reversibly Erred by meeting privately 
with counsel for [Off Shore] for forty- five minutes on a non-
consensual ex- parte conference, in which it communicated to [Off 
Shore] about the merits of the case. 
 [3]. The Trial Court Reversibly Erred by meeting privately 
with counsel for [Drink] for five minutes in a non- consensual ex-
parte conference and emphasized that if [Drink] did not accept a 
 
ordered [Drink], be sanctioned in the amount of Five Thousand Dollars 
($5,000) to be paid to the State of Hawaii General Fund." 
 
 2  The Order Granting MPSJ, inter alia, states that Drink's 
"November 7, 2019, Opposition is stricken as untimely[,]" and for the 
following reason:  
 WHEREAS, on October 4, 2019, [Off Shore]'s Motion was 
continued to November 15, 2019, pursuant to [Drink]'s motion to continue, filed September 27, 2019.  Pursuant to 
this order, [Drink] was granted leave to oppose [Off 
Shore]'s Motion by no later than November 1, 2019.  On 
November 7, 2019, [Drink] filed an untimely opposition to 
the Motion.  On November 12, 2019, [Off Shore] filed its reply in support of the Motion. 
 
3  The Honorable Peter T. Cahill presided.  
 
4  Drink's seven points "A" through "F" are not set forth in 
"separately numbered paragraphs" as required by Hawai‘ i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4).  (Emphasis added).  They have been numbered here. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST 'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
3 
 $1,000 settlement offer, it would rule against [Drink] in an 
upcoming hearing on a motion for summary judgment. 
 
[4]. The Trial Court Reversibly Erred when it decided the 
merits of the case at the settlement conference and came to a 
determination regarding how it would rule, without having the 
benefit of hearing argument at the December 6, 2020 [sic] hearing. 
 [5]. The Trial Court Reversibly Erred by not memorializing 
the settlement conference in the docket when in fact it required 
the parties to appear and made substantive rulings at the settlement conference. 
 [6]. The Trial Court Reversibly Erred on December 6, 2019, 
when it ruled against [Drink], with a ruling it had previously 
decided on and communicated to [Drink]'s counsel at the November 29, 2019 settlement conference. 
 [7]. The Trial Court Reversibly Erred when it set a 
supersedeas bond that did not subtract the $155,000.00 that [Off 
Shore] already was paid by the return of the e scrow deposit. 
I 
For each POE, Drink provides only a one-sentence statement of 
the alleged error, and does not cite to "where in the record the 
alleged error[s] occurred" and "where in the record the alleged 
error was objected to or the manner in which the alleged error was brought to the attention of the court" as required by HRAP Rule 28(b)(4)(ii) and (iii).       Although we are not obligated to search the record to crystallize Drink's arguments, Haw. Ventures, LLC v. Otaka, 
Inc., 114 Hawai‘ i 438, 469 n.16, 164 P.3d 696, 727 n.16 (2007) 
(citation omitted), and noncompliance with HRAP Rule 28(b) can alone be sufficient to affirm the Circuit Court's judgment, 
Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai‘ i 225, 228, 909 P.2d 553, 
556 (1995) (citation omitted), we endeavor to afford "litigants 
the opportunity to have their cases heard on the merits, where 
possible."  Marvin v. Pflueger, 127 Hawai‘ i 490, 496, 280 P.3d 
88, 94 (2012) (cleaned up).  "This is particularly so where the 
remaining sections of the brief provide the necessary 
information to identify the party's argument."  Id. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST 'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

POEs 1 through 5 challenge various aspects of the 
settlement conference as "non-consensual" and "ex-parte," and 
raise claims of other improprieties at the settlement conference.  Drink's general arguments in the brief regarding the settlement conference evidence a basic misunderstanding of circuit court rules and procedure.  Former Rule 12.1 of the 
Rules of the Circuit Courts of the State of Hawai‘ i (RCCH)
5 
provided for settlement conferences and authorized the courts to 
impose sanctions for violation of the rule.  Drink fails to properly support its argument that the Circuit Court committed various improprieties during the settlement conference.
6  These 
contentions are waived.  See HRAP Rule 28(b)(7). 
 
5  RCCH Rule 12.1(a)(6) (2000), entitled "CIVIL SETTLEMENT 
CONFERENCE; SETTTLEMENT CONFERENCE STATEMENT; CONFIDENTIAL SETTLEMENT 
CONFERENCE LETTER," states, in pertinent part, 
 
(6)Sanctions. The failure of a party or his attorney to 
appear at a scheduled settlement conference, the neglect of a party or his attorney to discuss or attempt to negotiate 
a settlement prior to the conference, or the failure of a 
party to have a person authorized to settle the case 
present at the conference shall, unless a good cause for 
such failure or neglect is shown, be deemed an undue interference with orderly procedures. As sanctions, the 
court may, in its discretion: 
 
(i)Dismiss the action on its own motion, or on the motion 
of any party or hold a party in default, as the case may be; 
 
(ii)Order a party to pay the opposing party's reasonable 
expenses and attorneys' fees; 
 (iii)Order a change in the calendar status of the action; 
 
(iv)Impose any other sanction as may be appropriate. 
 
6  Drink's statement of the case does not provide required "record 
references" for the "material facts" for the settlement conference.  See HRAP 
Rule 28(b)(3) (requiring "facts material to consideration of the questions and points presented" on appeal from the record) .  Nor does Drink's argument 
contain citations to any "authorities, statutes, and parts of the record 
relied on" pertaining to the settlement conference.  HRAP Rule 28(b)(7).  
Instead, Drink improperly refers to an "Affidavit" by Drink's counsel 
describing what occurred at the settlement conference attached to its opening 
brief.  The Affidavit was not made a part of the record below and is not part NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST 'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

As to POE 6, Drink argues that the Circuit Court erred 
by granting Off Shore's motion for partial summary judgment, but 
fails to cite the appropriate summary judgment standard or explain how it was incorrectly applied by the Circuit Court.   This contention is waived.  See In re Guardianship of Carlsmith, 
113 Hawai‘ i 236, 246, 151 P.3d 717, 727 (2007) (holding that 
appellate courts may "disregard a particular contention if the appellant makes no discernible argument in support of that position." (cleaned up)); HRAP Rule 28(b)(7) ("Points not argued may be deemed waived.").   As to POE 7, Drink argues that the Circuit Court abused its discretion when it "set a supersedeas bond that did 
not subtract the $155,000.00" that Off Shore had received due to 
the return of the escrow deposit, and that the supersedeas bond "should have been set at an amount that was necessary to cover the awarded attorneys [sic] fees."  However, the Order Setting Bond Amount only included the attorney's fee award, interests, and fees and costs for appeal in the bond amount, and not the principal amount of the judgment.
7  Drink's argument lacks merit.  
 
of the record on appeal, and appears to be appended to Drink's opening brief 
in violation of HRAP Rules 28(b)(3) and 10(a).  See also Alford v. City & 
Cnty. of Honolulu, 109 Hawai‘ i 14, 25 n.18, 122 P.3d 809, 820 n.18 (2005) 
("References and appendices not part of the record on appeal cannot be considered.  This is a violation of HRAP Rule 10 and such a practice cannot 
be tolerated.") (cleaned up); Bettencourt, 80 Hawai‘ i at 229 n.2, 909 P.2d 
 at 
557 n.2 (holding that matters outside the record on appeal may neither be 
appended nor referred to in an appellate brief) (citati on omitted). 
   
7  The Order Setting Bond Amount granted a stay pending appeal on 
the following conditions of the bond:   
   c.  [Drink] shall have thirty (30) days following entry of 
this order to post a bond in the total amount of $51,710.00 as 
security for the following amounts:
