DWIGHT J. VICENTE, Claimant-Appellant/Appellant, v.
HILO MEDICAL INVESTORS, LTD., Employer-Appellee/Appellee, and
AMERICAN HOME ASSURANCE COMPANY/AIG CLAIMS SERVICES, Insurance
Carrier-Appellee/Appellee, and JOHN MULLEN & COMPANY, INC.,
Insurance Adjuster-Appellee/Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD 
(CASE NO. AB 2015-259(H)(S); DCD NO. 1-87-00882) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
appellate jurisdiction over an appeal by Claimant-Appellant/ 
Appellant Dwight J. Vicente (Vicente), self-represented, from the 
Labor and Industrial Appeals Board's (LIRAB) January 6, 2020 
interlocutory order denying Vicente's November 25, 2019 motion to 
limit jurisdiction and for a remedy in the LIRAB's future trial 
in LIRAB Case No. 2015-259(H)(S) (LIRAB proceeding). The record 
on appeal in CAAP-20-0000022 does not include a final decision or 
order by LIRAB regarding its review of a June 3, 2015 decision by 
the Director of the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations 
regarding Vicente's claim for further workers' compensation 
benefits for a May 3, 1987 injury. 
An aggrieved party may appeal a final decision and 
order by the LIRAB directly to the Hawai# i Intermediate Court of 
Appeals pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 386-88 (2015) NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and HRS § 91-14(a) (2012 & Supp. 2019). The appealability of a 
decision and order of the LIRAB is governed by HRS § 91-14(a). 
"[A]n order that finally adjudicates a benefit or penalty under 
the worker's compensation law is an appealable final order under 
HRS § 91-14(a), although other issues remain." Lindinha v. Hilo 
Coast Processing Co.
, 104 Hawai# i 164, 168, 86 P.3d 973, 977 
(2004) (citation omitted); 
see Bocalbos v. Kapiolani Med. Ctr.
, 
89 Hawai# i 436, 443, 974 P.2d 1026, 1033 (1999) (holding that "a 
decision that finally adjudicates the matter of medical and 
temporary disability benefits is an appealable final order under 
HRS § 91–14(a), even though the matter of permanent disability 
has been left for later determination."). 
In the instant case, LIRAB's January 6, 2020 
interlocutory order does not finally adjudicate any benefit or 
penalty, nor does it finally determine the substantive issues in 
the underlying LIRAB proceeding. 
Absent an appealable final 
decision or order by the LIRAB on the substantive issues in LIRAB Case No. 2015-259(H)(S), Vicente's appeal is premature and we 
lack appellate jurisdiction. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court 
case number CAAP-20-0000022 is dismissed for lack of appellate 
jurisdiction.
