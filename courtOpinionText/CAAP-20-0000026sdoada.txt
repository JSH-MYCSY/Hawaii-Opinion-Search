v. 
ZACHARY R. YAMAUCHI, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
#EWA DIVISION 
(CASE NO. 1DTC-19-011055) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By:  Leonard, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Zachary R. 
Yamauchi appeals from 
the "Order Denying Defendant Yamauchi's Motion to Withdraw No 
Contest Plea Electronically Filed September 25, 2019[,]" entered 
by the District Court of the First Circuit, #Ewa Division, on 
December 16, 2019.1  For the reasons explained below, we affirm 
the Order. 
On March 28, 2019, Yamauchi was cited for excessive 
speeding in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291C-
105(a).  He pleaded not guilty.  He was referred to the Office of 
the Public Defender (OPD).  On August 7, 2019, he pleaded no-
contest pursuant to a plea agreement.  A "Notice of Entry of 
Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment" was entered the same 
day.  The Judgment included a sentence.  The sentence included a

30-day suspension of Yamauchi's driver's license under HRS 
§ 291C-105(c)(1)(B). 
On September 25, 2019, Yamauchi (through OPD) filed a 
"Motion to Withdraw Guilty [sic] Plea and Re-set Case for Trial[.]"  A hearing was set for October 15, 2019. 
On September 30, 2019 (before the hearing on the motion 
to withdraw plea), OPD submitted a proposed order appointing counsel.  OPD stated that it could not continue acting as counsel because Yamauchi was claiming ineffective assistance of counsel. On October 14, 2019, the district court entered an order appointing new counsel for Yamauchi. 
On October 15, 2019, Yamauchi moved to continue the 
hearing on his motion to withdraw plea.  The hearing was continued to November 19, December 3, and December 10, 2019.  At the December 10, 2019 hearing the district court took the motion to withdraw plea under advisement.  On December 16, 2019, the district court entered the Order, which denied the motion to withdraw plea.  This appeal followed. 
Yamauchi raises two points on appeal: 
"1. The trial court erred by denying
YAMAUCHI's . . . Motion to Withdraw No Contest 
Plea to the offense of Excessive Speeding, where(1) YAMAUCHI entered the plea not knowing that itwould result in the automatic consequence that, inorder to retrieve his driver's license, he wouldbe required to post a $25,000 [sic] bond or obtainsufficient insurance, called an SR-22, (2) hisappointed counsel never informed him of the SR-22requirement, (3) the SR-22 is a de facto threeyear suspension of his driver's license, and(4) YAMAUCHI would not have entered a no contestplea had he known about the SR-22"; and 
"2. YAMAUCHI's counsel's performance prior
to his plea of no contest was not within the rangeof competence demanded of attorneys in criminalcases, and therefore constitutionally deficient,because his counsel failed to advise YAMAUCHI that, if he plead guilty to Excessive Speeding,(1) he would be required to post a $25,000 [sic]bond or obtain insurance (the SR-22) in order to 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
have his driver's license returned to him, and
(2) the SR-22 automatically applied by operationof statute." 
(1) "The denial of a post-sentence motion for 
withdrawal of plea is reviewed for abuse of discretion."  State 
v. Fogel, 95 Hawai# i 398, 405, 23 P.3d 733, 740 (2001) (citation 
omitted).  "An abuse of discretion occurs if the trial court has clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or has disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant."  Id. (cleaned up). 
The district court did not abuse its discretion by 
denying Yamauchi's motion to withdraw plea because the motion was untimely.  
Hawai# i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 32(d) 
provides: 
Withdrawal of Plea .  A motion to withdraw a plea of guilty
or of nolo contendere may be made before sentence is imposed
or imposition of sentence is suspended; provided that, to
correct manifest injustice the court, upon a party's motionsubmitted no later than ten (10) days after imposition of 
sentence , shall set aside the judgment of conviction and
permit the defendant to withdraw the plea.  At any later 
time , a defendant seeking to withdraw a plea of guilty or
nolo contendere may do so only by petition pursuant to Rule 
40 of these rules and the court shall not set aside such a 
plea unless doing so is necessary to correct manifestinjustice. 
(emphasis added).  Yamauchi's motion to withdraw plea was made 
more than ten days after the district court imposed his sentence. The motion was not made by petition pursuant to HRPP Rule 40 ("Post-conviction Proceeding"), as required under HRPP Rule 32(d).  The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the untimely motion. 
Even if the district court had treated Yamauchi's 
motion as a nonconforming petition under HRPP Rule 40(c)(2), the SR-22 requirement is a collateral consequence of an excessive speeding conviction, of which Yamauchi was not required to be informed.  "[A]n accused need not be informed prior to the acceptance of his guilty plea about every conceivable collateral 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
effect the conviction might have."  Reponte v. State, 57 Haw. 
354, 364, 556 P.2d 577, 584 (1976).  In determining whether a consequence is "collateral," this court has explained: 
A direct consequence  is one which has a definite, immediate
and largely automatic effect on defendant's punishment. 
Illustrations of collateral consequences are  loss of the 
right to vote or travel abroad, loss of civil serviceemployment, loss of a driver's license , loss of the right to
possess firearms or an undesirable discharge from the ArmedServices.  The failure to warn of such collateral consequences will not warrant vacating a plea because theyare peculiar to the individual  and generally result from the
actions taken by agencies the court does not control . 
D'Ambrosio v. State, 112 Hawai# i 446, 460, 146 P.3d 606, 620 
(App. 2006) (emphasis added) (quoting State v. Nguyen, 81 Hawai# i 
279, 288, 916 P.2d 689, 698 (1996)). 
Yamauchi testified during the hearing on his motion to 
withdraw plea.  On direct examination, he testified: 
Q. Okay.  Do you remember ever having been advised
of an obligation under what's called the SR-22 insurancerequirement as being a part of the penalty under that pleaagreement?  
A.  No. 
. . . . 
Q.  And so on that day when you -- when did you
find out about that SR-22 requirement?  
A.  Was about close to a month after I had entered 
my plea, already had done my 30-day license suspension.  I 
got a letter in the mail saying that I was required to
obtain a SR-22 or a $25,000 insurance bond  --  
Q.  Okay.  
A.  -- to be able to retain my license . 
. . . . 
Q.  Okay.  And do you remember the court ever
advising you of that --  
A.  No.  
Q.  -- obligation as you entered your plea on --  A.  I -- I do not. 
(emphasis added). 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On cross-examination, Yamauchi clarified: 
Q.  Now, Mr. Yamauchi, when you got that letter,
who was that letter from?  
A.  That was from the Department of Motor Vehicles, 
I think DOT and DMV .  
Q.  So wasn't part of your criminal trial, is that 
--  
A.  No.  
Q.  -- correct?  Okay. 
(emphasis added). 
The SR-22 requirement is imposed not by the Hawai# i 
Penal Code, but by HRS Chapter 287, the Hawai# i Motor Vehicle 
Safety Responsibility Act.  The Act provides, in relevant part: 
Proof of financial responsibility required upon
conviction of certain offenses . 
(a) Whenever a driver's license has been suspended or
revoked: 
. . . . 
(2) Upon a conviction of any offense pursuant to law
. . . ; 
. . . . 
the license shall not at any time thereafter be issued to
the person whose license has been suspended or revoked, norshall the person thereafter operate a motor vehicle, unlessand until the person has furnished and thereafter maintainsproof of financial responsibility[.] 
HRS § 287-20(a)(2) (2007 & Supp. 2019).  "Proof of financial 
responsibility means proof of ability to respond in damages for liability, on account of accidents occurring subsequent to the effective date of such proof, arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle[.]"  HRS § 287-1 (2007). Proof of financial responsibility can be provided by a motor vehicle insurance policy complying with HRS § 431:10C-301(b)(1) (2019).  If a person does not have motor vehicle insurance, "[p]roof of financial responsibility may be evidenced by the bond of a surety company[.]"  HRS § 287-35(a) (2007).  The bond must 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
be filed with the county director of finance.  See id. and HRS 
§ 287-1.  Because the SR-22 requirement is "peculiar to the individual and generally result[s] from the actions taken by agencies the court does not control[,]" it is a collateral consequence of an excessive speeding conviction, of which the failure to warn will not warrant vacating a plea.  See D'Ambrosio, 112 
Hawai# i at 460, 146 P.3d at 620.  For this 
additional reason the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Yamauchi's motion to withdraw his no-contest plea.
(2) Yamauchi's ineffective assistance of counsel 
argument is raised for the first time on appeal.  Ordinarily, "the failure to properly raise an issue at the trial level precludes a party from raising that issue on appeal."  
State v. 
Hoglund, 71 Haw. 147, 150, 785 P.2d 1311, 1313 (1990).  In this case, however, Yamauchi's allegation that his former defense counsel was ineffective is based solely on OPD's failure to inform him of the potential SR-22 requirement, which depended in part on factors unrelated to his conviction.  In light of our ruling that the SR-22 requirement is a collateral consequence of an excessive speeding conviction, OPD's failure to advise Yamauchi about the possible SR-22 requirement was not a "specific error[] or omission[] reflecting defense counsel's lack of skill, judgment or diligence[,]" nor did it result "in either the withdrawal or substantial impairment[] of a potentially meritorious defense."  Najera v. State
, 143 Hawai# i 83, 88, 422 
P.3d 661, 666 (App. 2018) (cleaned up).2 
2 In Najera, the petitioner "asserted that he received ineffective
assistance of counsel because his trial counsel did not advise him that his 
no-contest pleas would subject him to automatic deportation  and that had he 
received this advice, he would not have pleaded no contest."  Id. at 85-86, 422 P.3d at 663-64 (emphasis added).  "[D]eportation is an integral part —indeed, sometimes the most important part — of the penalty that may be imposedon noncitizen defendants who plead guilty to specified crimes."  Id. at 89,422 P.3d at 667 (quoting Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356, 369, 130 S.Ct.1473, 176 L.Ed.2d 284 (2010)).  Indeed, we noted that "Najera's no contest
plea to a controlled substance offense for first-degree promoting a dangerous
drug that was a class A felony made it virtually certain  that he would be 
deported."  Id. at 90, 422 P.3d at 668 (emphasis added).  Thus, deportation isa direct, not a collateral, consequence of a noncitizen defendant's conviction
