A
PPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 2CC191000167(1)) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
appellate jurisdiciton over Plaintiffs-Appellees Allen B. Arakawa 
and Debbie E. Arakawa's (the Arakawas) appeal from the Honorable 
Rhonda I.L. Loo's January 8, 2020 interlocutory order granting 
Defendant/Cross-Claim Defendant/Appellee Bank of America, N.A. 
(Bank of America) and Defendant-Appellee Mortgage Electronic 
Registration Systems, Inc.'s motion to partially dismiss the 
Arakawas and Plaintiffs-Appellees James Jonathon Driscoll 
(Driscoll), George M. Kaimiola and Zilpah K. Kaimiola's (the 
Kaimiolas) first amended complaint and sever their claims, 
because the circuit court has neither resolved all of the  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
multiple claims in this case nor reduced its dispositive rulings 
to an appealable final judgment. 
An aggrieved party cannot obtain appellate review of a 
circuit court's dispositive orders in a civil case pursuant to 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a)(2016) until the circuit 
court reduces the dispositive rulings to an appealable final 
judgment pursuant to Rules 58 or 54(b) of the Hawai# i Rules of 
Civil Procedure (HRCP). See Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & 
Wright
, 76 Hawai# i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). All of 
the parties apparently agree that the circuit court has not yet adjudicated and entered a judgment on all of the multiple claims 
asserted in: 
• the Kaimiolas, Driscoll, and the Arakawas'
June 17, 2019 first amended complaint, 
• Defendant/Cross-Claim Plaintiff/Appellee Jason C.Balberdi Balberdi's September 30, 2019 cross-claim, 
• Defendants/Cross-Claim Plaintiffs/AppelleesSimon T. Ngan and Jill S.A. Ngan's September 30,2019 cross-claim, 
• Defendant/Cross-Claim Plaintiff/Appellee AmericanSavings Bank, F.S.B.'s October 2, 2019 cross-claim, 
• Defendants/Cross-Claim Plaintiffs/Third-PartyPlaintiffs/Appellees George Matic, Milena Matic,Aleksandra O. Matic, and Steven Matic's (theMatics) October 25, 2019 cross-claim, and 
• the Matics' October 25, 2019 third-partycomplaint. 
Nevertheless, the Arakawas assert in their February 20, 2020 
statement of jurisdiction that, to the limited extent that the 
January 8, 2020 interlocutory order severs the Arakawas' claims 
pursuant to HRCP Rule 21, the January 8, 2020 interlocutory order 
is immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine and 
the 
Forgay doctrine. However, our review of the record and 
relevant case law reveals that the January 8, 2020 interlocutory 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
order does not satisfy the multiple requirements for 
appealability under the collateral order doctrine or the Forgay 
doctrine. See Greer v. Baker
, 137 Hawai# i 249, 253, 369 P.3d 
832, 836 (2016) (reciting the requirements for appeals under the collateral order doctrine and the 
Forgay doctrine); Hofmann v. 
De Marchena Kaluche & Asociados, 642 F.3d 995, 998 (11th Cir. 2011) (holding that the collateral order doctrine does not 
provide appellate jurisdiction for a severance order issued under 
Rule 21 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure); cf. In re Lieb, 
915 F.2d 180, 182–185 (5th Cir. 1990) (holding that a district 
court's order severing claims and directing that they continue as 
separate actions in bankruptcy court was not an appealable final 
order). Absent an appealable final judgment, we lack appellate 
jurisdiction.
 Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case 
number CAAP-20-0000036 is dismissed for lack of appellate 
jurisdiction.
