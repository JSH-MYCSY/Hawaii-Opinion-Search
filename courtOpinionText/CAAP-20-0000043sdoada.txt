HERBERT R. KASNETZ, Plaintiff-Appellant,  
v.  
DEBORAH A. KASNETZ, Defendant-Appellee  
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT  
(CASE NO. 1DV161000656)  
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and Guidry, JJ.)  
Plaintiff -Appellant Herbert R. Kasnetz ( Husband) 
appeals from the Post -Divorce Judgment Regarding Reserved Issues 
(Judgment ) entered by the Family Court of the First Circuit 
(family court ) on January 16, 2020, as well as the Court's 
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law (FOF/COL) entered by the 
family court on November 1, 2019 . 1 
On appeal, Husband raises four points of error , 
contending : (1) that the family court abused its discretion in 
rejecting Husband's expert witness's computations, pertaining to

FOF/COL.

the valuation of his Category 1 interests , in favor of an 
alternate method; (2) that the family court erred when it sua 
sponte awarded Defendant -Appellee Deborah A. Kasnetz ( Wife)a 
$1.89 million Wells Fargo Individual Retirement Account (IRA) 
that was previously awarded to Husband in the property division , 
and computed Wife's equalization payment based on a property 
division chart that reflected the IRA as still awarded to 
Husband; (3) that the family court abused its discretion in 
awarding Wife $10,200 a month in spousal support for the 
duration of Husband's lifetime; and (4) that the family court 
abused its discretion in awarding Wife $450,000 in attorney 's 
fees and costs. 
Upon careful review of the record and relevant legal 
authorities, and giving due consideration to the issues raised 
and the arguments advanced by the parties, we resolve Husband's 
points of error as follows : 
(1) Husband contends that the family court erred in 
its valuation of Husband's Category 12 interests , by improperly 
2 "Category 1" refers to one of the five partnership model 
categories. 
The partnership model distinguishes between marital 
partnership property that is brought into the marriage and 
marital partnership property that is acquired during the 
marriage. Accordingly, Hawaiʻi courts  assign values to 
marital partnership property using five categories designed 
to assist courts in  determining the equitable division and 
distribution of property between spouses[.]

valuing his Brookhollow National B ank shares. Husband acquired 
these bank shares prior to his marriage to Wife , and sold them 
during the marriage in 2002 . At trial, Husband's expert 
witness, Charles Wilhoite (Wilhoite ), testified that the value 
of Husband's interest in the bank shares at the time of his 
marriage, in 1990, was $9,730,000 . Calculation of that 
valuation relied upon the sale price of the bank shares in 2002. 
Wife's witness, John R ichard Candon, III (Candon), testified 
that Wilhoite's valuation methodology was flawed in its reliance 
on subsequent events, i.e., the sale of the bank shares in 2002. 
The family court made the following relevant findings 
of fact  (FOF),  with regard to the valuation of Husband's bank 
shares at the time of his marriage to Wife in 1990,  which we 
review under the "clearly erroneous" standard. Fisher v. 
Fisher, 111 Hawaiʻ i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 (2006).   3
23. [Husband] claimed his net worth at the time of his 
marriage to [Wife] on June 22, 1990 (his Category 1 
value) was $13,129,740.00 . This claim is largely based 
on the value [Husband] places on his Brookhollow 
Bancshares, Inc. (BBI) and Brookhollow National Bank

by a spouse on the date of marriage[.]" Id. 
3 Of the following FOF, Husband challenges FOF 31, 36 -38, 40-41, 
53, 69, 75-77, and 79 -80. We find that these facts are not clearly 
erroneous. The remaining FOF are unchallenged, and are therefore binding on 
this court. Okada Trucking Co. v. Bd . of Water Supply , 97 Hawaiʻi 450, 458,

(BNB) interests. These assets are collectively referred 
to as the "Brookhollow interests" . 
 . . . . 
31. [Husband] and [his first wife] clearly reached an 
agreement [the January 1990 Agreement Incident to 
Divorce (AITD)] that the Brookhollow National Bank stock 
had a fair market value of $13.125 ($10.50 x 1.25 ) a 
share at or near the time of their divorce [in 1990]. 
  . . . .
35. According to [Husband's] Statement of Financial 
Condition as of December 31, 1990, the estimated current 
value of [Husband's] 115,936 shares of Brookhollow 
Bancshares, Inc. stock was $1,595,279.00 ($13.76 a 
share) and the estimated current value of his 3,790 
shares of Brookhollow National Bank, Inc. stock was 
$63,520.00 ($16.76 a share), for a total of 
$1,658,799.00 . According to that Statement, his net 
worth was $5,178,301.00 as of December 31, 1990. 
36. In compiling the Statements, Ms. [Lila] Husband[4] 
testified that it was not her goal to reflect fair 
market value, and she had no (personal) knowledge of the 
fair market value of the BBI and BNB assets. Ms. 
Husband testified the "estimated current value" of the 
assets contained in Exhibit V were "in all cases 
confirmed or estimated by others." She confirmed her 
notes of her discussion with Dan Bennett [th e President 
of Brookhollow Bancshares, Inc. and Board Secretary and 
Executive Vice -President of Brookhollow National Bank] 
had "fmv" (meaning fair marke t value) and "a number." 
She apparently simply repeated Mr. Bennett's calculation 
or opinion in her Statements of Financial Condition. 
37. When questioned specifically about the BNB estimated 
current value, Ms. Husband confirmed that the estimate 
was more than, or better than book value , and that she 
used a multiplier of 1.25 as directed by Dan Bennett. 
38. When questioned specifically about the BBI estimated 
current value, Ms. Husband confirms the multiplier used 
was 1 (according to Dan Bennett) and confirmed that was 
Mr. Bennett's opinion of the fair market value of BBI. 
39. The parties stipulated that [Husband] gave untruthful 
testimony to the Court about his Statements of Financial 
Condition in a prior proceeding. At that prior 
proceeding, [Husband] claimed he had no involvement in 
the preparation of these Statements. This turned out to 
be materially incorrect.

accountant in Texas.

40. [Husband] testified at trial that he had reviewed the 
Statements of Financial Condition at the time they were 
prepared for him, but that he "paid no attention to 
them". [Husband's] testimony was not credible in this 
regard. 
41. In addition, [Husband] did not deny paying $10.50 a 
share (book value) to acquire additional Brookhollow 
National Bank shares the month immediately following his 
divorce from [his first wife] (i.e. March, 1990) and the 
month immediately preceding his marriage to [Wife] (i.e. 
May, 1990). 
 . . . . 
44. On the date of his marriage to [Wife], [Husband] owned 
3,790 shares of BNB common stock and 115,936 shares of 
BBI common stock. 
45. During the marriage, between 1997 and 2000, [Husband] 
purchased 500 additional shares of BNB. 
46. During the marriage, [Husband] purchased 5,750 
additional shares of BBI as follows: 1,750 shares in 
1992; 1,000 shares in 1994; and 3,000 shares between 
1997 and 2002. 
47. As of 2002, [Husband] owned 4,290 shares in BNB, and 
121,686 shares in BBI. 
48. On April 2, 2002, BNB and BBI were acquired by Regions 
Financial Corporation for approximately $ 26.6 million, 
or $132.49 per share. 
49. [Husband] received $ 16,969,414 for his 121,686 shares 
in BBI and $ 251,866 for his 4,290 shares in BNB. 
50. In September 2016, [Husband] hired Wilhoite Managements 
Associates to complete a valuation analysis of 3,790 
shares of BNB common stock and 115,936 shares of BBI 
common stock, owned by [Husband] as of June 22, 1990 
(the "Valuation Date"). 
51. Charles Wilhoite, CPA testified as an expert business 
evaluator. 
52. The best evidence of fair market value is the price 
paid after arms -length negotiation between unrelated 
parties. 
53. The definition of fair market value is generally based 
on information that was known or knowable as of the 
valuation date.

54. Absent a negotiated transaction, Mr. Wilhoite testified 
that experts generally look at 3 -5 years of financial 
operating results for periods leading up to the 
Valuation Date. In this case, he could only find 
information for year -end 2002. There were no financial 
statements available to Mr. Wilhoite prior to 1992. 
55. Despite the limits on information, Mr. Wilhoite 
determined he could evaluate the Brookhollow Assets by 
following the Statements on Standards for Valuation 
Services ("SSVS") requiring him [to] take certain steps, 
including to disclose limitations and develop a credible 
method of valuation. 
 . . . . 
61. Mr. Wilhoite testified that, absent a negotiated 
transaction at or prior to the valuation date, it is 
reasonable to rely on valuations by people who are 
reasonably informed and knowledgeable about both the 
business and valuation. Mr. Wilhoite believed he was a 
person whose knowledge, training and experience qualify 
him to make such a valuation. 
62. Acknowledging the limitation of information that was 
known or knowable as of the valuation date, Mr. Wilhoite 
based his evaluation on a market approach with three (3) 
identified methods given weighted values: The 
Transaction Approach of $ 16.6 mil. at 60% weight; the 
Guideline Publicly Traded Company Method of $ 13.4 mil. 
at 35% weight; and the Purchase Offers Method of $ 24.9 
mil. at 5% weight. 
63. Using this selected market approach, Mr. Wilhoite 
developed what he considered a reasonable estimate of 
the fair market value of the BNB and BBI (100%) as of 
June 22, 1990 at $ 15.9 mil. 
64. While there were intervening events between 1990 and 
2002, Mr. Wilhoite concluded that since the subject bank 
consistently performed during the same period at a 5.1% 
steady growth rate, those events would not affect his 
ultimate evaluation. 
65. Mr. Wilhoite's expert opinion was that a reasonable 
estimate of the fair market value of [Husband's] BNB and 
BBI shares as of June 22, 1990 was $ 9,730,000 . 
66. Mr. Wilhoite rejected the position that the Brookhollow 
Assets were worth $ 1,658,799 as of December 31, 1990. 
This would reflect a 20 -21% rate of growth in value per 
year before the assets were sold in 2002. A good rate 
of growth for other banks similarly situated would be 
7%. He concluded that a 20 -21% rate of growth in value 
per year was not reasonable. The Court notes this 
opinion was anchored in the April 2, 2002 value

reflected in the Regions Financial Corporation 
purchase.[5] 
67. [Wife] retained John Candon, CPA, ABV, CFF to provide a 
review opinion of the WMA Evaluation. 
68. Mr. Candon testified as an expert in the area of 
business valuations and accounting. 
69. Mr. Candon testified that under SSVS, subsequent events 
should only be utilized as a caution or as a 
confirmation, not as the sole basis of valuation. 
 . . . . 
73. According to Mr. Candon, SSVS was clear: subsequent 
events should NEVER be the sole basis for the valuation 
-which is what Mr. Wilhoite has done. 
74. Therefore, Mr. Candon uniformly rejected Mr. Wilhoite's 
method of evaluation as not up to professional 
standards, not credible, not reliable and not relevant. 
Mr. Candon concluded that Mr. Wilhoite should have 
ethically refused to complete the appraisal. 
75. The Court finds Mr. Candon's critique of Mr. Wilhoite's 
valuation to be reasonable, credible, and relevant. 
76. In evaluating the testimony of both experts, the Court 
determines that Mr. Wilhoite's explanation, while 
detailed and thoughtful, is fatally flawed in its 
treatment and reliance on subsequent events. The 
professional standard does not allow for the use of 
valuation data at least twelve (12) years subsequent to 
the valuation date, to include the April 2, 2002 
purchase by Regions Financial Corporation of the 
Brookhollow interests. Furthermore, none of the 
exceptions or conditions that would allow for the 
consideration of subsequent data exist. To the extent 
that it relies on subsequent events, Mr. Wilhoite's 
valuation is therefore of very limited value. 
77. The Court finds that the February 1, 1990 AITD and 
[Husband's] Statement of Financial Condition for 1990 
were credible and reliable sources of information for 
determining the fair market value of [Husband's] 
Brookhollow interests on June 22, 1990[.] 
5  . . . . 
The family court's reference is to the "$ 26.6 million dollar sale 
[of Husband's bank shares] to Regions Financial Corporation in 2002."

79. The Court therefore finds, based on the relevant and 
credible evidence presented at trial, that the fair 
market value of BBI stock was $ 14.05 per share on 
June 22, 1990. 
80. The Court also finds, based on the relevant and 
credible evidence presented at trial, that the fair 
market value of BNB stock was $ 14.45 per share on 
June 22, 1990. 
(Cleaned up). 
The above findings of fact are not clearly erroneous. 
We note that the family court, as the trier of fact, "could 
reject expert testimony in whole or in part." See Ray v. 
Kapiolani Med. Specialists , 125 Hawaiʻi 253, 263, 259 P.3d 569, 
579 (2011). It was within the family court's discretion to 
weigh the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses, 
including Candon, Wilhoite, and Husband. The family court found 
that Wilhoite and Husband's testimony w as not credible; it found 
Candon's testimony to be credible. The family court also found 
the Agreement Incident to Divorce, signed by Husband and his 
first wife in January 1990, and Husband's December 1990 
Statement of Financial Condition, to be "credible and reliable 
sources of information for determining the fai r market value of 
[Husband's] Brookhollow interests on June 22, 1990." 
On this basis, the family court found that the bank 
shares were worth a total of $ 1,683,666.30 . 6 The family court 's 
This amount represents the family court's valuation of Husband's 
BNB stock at $ 54,765.50  (3,790 shares at $14.45 per share), and BBI stock at 
$1,628,900.80 (115,936 shares at $14.05 per share).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
valuation of Husband's bank shares was reasonable and based upon 
what the family court found to be the credible record evidence . 
We conclude that the family court did not abuse its discretion 
in its valuation of Husband's Category 1 assets. 
(2) Husband contends that the family court erred in 
deviating from the Partnership Model to sua sponte award 
Husband's $1.89 million IRA to Wife , and that "because the court 
computed her equalization payment with this IRA still awarded to 
Husband, Wife received both the IRA and 50% of its value [.]" 
"The partnership model is the appropriate law for the 
family courts to apply when exercising their discretion in the 
adjudication of property division in divorce proceedings." 
Tougas v. Tougas , 76 Hawaiʻi 19, 28, 86 8 P.2d 437, 446 (1994). 
In determining whether the circumstances justify deviation 
from the partnership model, the family court must consider 
the following: the respective merits of the parties, the 
relative abilities of the parties, the condition in which 
each party will be left by the divorce, the burdens imposed 
upon either party for the benefit of the children of the 
parties, and all other circumstances of the case. 
Gordon, 135 Hawaiʻi at 352-53, 350 P. 3d at 1020 -21. 
We review the family court's decision as to "whether 
or not the facts present any valid and relevant considerations 
authorizing a deviation from the Partnership Model Division" as 
a question of law, under the right/wrong standard of review.

"whether or not there will be a deviation," and "the extent of 
the deviation," for abuse of discretion. Id.  
The family court entered  the following conclusions of 
law  (COL),  
E.4. [Wife] is sixty -five (65). She is not reasonably 
employable and her only income is $1,023.60 [per 
month] from social security. [Wife] lives in a 
rental unit. Her monthly expenses are $16,693.98 , a 
deficit of < $15,670.38 >. Although [Wife] will 
receive alimony of $10,200.00 per month, she will 
only receive this for so long as [Husband] is alive 
and [Husband] is eighty -four (84) and in poor health. 
After receipt of alimony, [Wife 's] monthly deficit is 
<$5,470.38 >. In order to lower her monthly deficit, 
[Wife] is charged with using her equalization payment 
herein to purchase a home and pay off her car loan. 
E.5. [Wife] will also likely have increased needs for care 
and assistance in the future. [Wife's] ability to 
provide for her own future care needs, when alimony 
is no longer applicable, and even with the property 
she will receive as a result of this divorce, will 
depend on the amount of care needed and length of 
time that care is needed. It will also depend upon 
[Wife's] use of the property she is being awarded 
herein, and whether she can generate substantial 
income therefrom. 
E.6. [Husband] is eighty -four (84). Unlike [Wife], 
[Husband's] health care needs are substantial now, 
but largely known (present and future ) -and are 
being met with private pay and private care. 
[Husband] is already fully capable of continuing to 
manage his investments in a manner that generates 
income well above his current expenses. He lives in 
a well-furnished 4 bedroom, 2.5 bath home in Koko Kai 
(a quality residential subdivision) with a pool, 
ocean view, solar and water filtration system. 
[Husband's] home is mortgage -free. [Husband's] needs 
are taken care of and he is able to live comfortably. 
[Husband's] current net gain (income minus expenses) 
per month is $58,537.00 . After monthly alimony of 
$10,200.00 , [Husband] still enjoys a net gain of 
$48,337.00 . [Husband] should continue to enjoy a net 
gain even after complying with the Court's orders 
herein, and for the rest of his life. 
10   
 
 
  
 
 
E.8. Based on the totality of the relevant and credible  
evidence, it is just and equitable to deviate from 
the property division awarded in Court's Attachment A 
and additionally award [Wife] the Wells Fargo Bank IRA account [] in the amount of $1,894,399.00, or an 
asset of equivalent value if agreed -upon by the 
parties.  
 
  
  
 
 
 
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
E.7.  The totality of the relevant and credible evidence  
present valid and relevant considerations authorizing a deviation from the Partnership Model under these 
circumstances .  
(Emphasis added ) (footnote omitted ). 
The record reflects that the family court deviated 
from the Partnership Model , and awarded Husband's IRA to Wife, 
based on the totality of the relevant and credible evidence of 
Wife's need. The family court specifically identified Wife's 
advanced age, lack of employment prospects , limited income (from 
social security), expenditures, and anticipated future care 
needs, as the basis for awarding the IRA account to Wife. We 
conclude, on this record, that the family court was not wrong in 
its conclusion that the above facts represent valid 
considerations justifying deviation from the Partnership Model.7 
We conclude that the family court did not abuse its discretion 
in its decision to deviate from the Partnership Model , and with 
regard to the extent of its deviation. 
7 To the extent that the above COL are mixed questions of law and 
fact, we find that they are not clearly erroneous. In re Water Use Permit 
Applications , 94 Hawaiʻi 97, 119, 9 P.3d 409, 431 (2000) ("A COL that presents 
mixed questions of fact and law is reviewed under the clearly erroneous 
standard because the conclusion is dependent upon the facts and circumstances 
of the particular case.") (citation omitted).

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
We further find, however, that the family court erred 
by calculating Wife's equalization payment based on a property 
division chart that purported to award the IRA to Husband rather 
than Wife, such that "she received both the IRA ($1,894,399) and 
50% of its value ($992,199), for a total of $2,976,598." We 
thus vacate the family court's Judgment, and the Court's 
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, in part, and remand for 
recalculation of an equalization payment to Wif e that accounts 
for the IRA award t o Wife. 
(3) Husband contends that the family court erred in 
awarding Wife spousal support during the duration of Husband's 
lifetime. We review the family court's award of spousal support 
for abuse of discretion. 
"When deciding in a divorce case whether one party 
must pay periodic support to the other, for how long, and how 
much, the family court must consider all of the factors 
enumerated in [Hawaii Revised Statutes] HRS § 580-47(a)." 
Hamilton v. Hamilton , 138 Hawaiʻi 185, 209, 378 P.3d 901, 925 
(2016) (cleaned up ). 
In addition to any other relevant factors considered, the 
court, in ordering spousal support and maintenance, shall 
consider the following factors: 
(1) Financial resources of the parties; 
(2) Ability of the party seeking support and maintenance 
to meet his or her needs independently;

(12) (b) [Husband] has not been employed during 
the majority of the marriage, but manages 
his finances in such a way as to result 
in current monthly income of $ 92,223.00 . 
Vocational skills and employability of the 
party seeking support and maintenance. 
(a) [Wife] is not able to work in any 
meaningful manner. 
Needs of the parties. 
(a) At the time of trial, [Husband's] total 
monthly income was $ 92,223.00 , and his 
total monthly expenses were <$ 33,686.00 >. 
(b) At the time of trial, [Wife's] total

total monthly expenses was 
<[$]16,223.98 >.

N/A 
Ability of the party from whom support and 
maintenance is sought to meet his or her own 
needs while meeting the needs of the party 
seeking support and maintenance. 
(a) At trial, [Husband] had a monthly savings 
of approximately $ 58,537.00 , and can

million in assets as a result of property

amounts from [Wife's] expenses in 
calculating her need for the purposes of 
alimony.

(13) Probable duration of the need of the party 
seeking support and maintenance. 
(a) Life time. 
D.19. In awarding alimony, the Court specifically finds 
that, at age sixty -five (65), after assuming the 
fulltime role of homemaker for almost two and one-
half (2½) decades, it is unreasonable and unrealistic 
to expect [Wife] to re -establish her legal career in 
a state where she has never practiced law (and has 
not passed the bar) and earn income consistent with 
the standard of living established during the course 
of the parties' almost twenty -eight (28) year 
marriage. 
D.20. There is a lack of sufficient evidence to show that 
[Husband's] ability to meet his own needs, even those 
estimated to increase over time, would be affected by 
an award of lifetime spousal support to [Wife]. 
D.21. Based on its full consideration of all the relevant 
statutory factors and the credible evidence received 
by the Court, the Court concludes that an order 
requiring [Husband] pay [Wife] $ 10,200.00 a month as 
and for spousal support for the remainder of his 
life, with payments to commence the first month 
following the Court's decision on the remaining 
issues in this matter, is just and equitable. 
D.22. The award of alimony, tied to [Husband's] lifetime as 
opposed to [Wife's] lifetime, takes into 
consideration the entirety of the Court's property 
division awarded herein. 
(Footnote omitted). 
To the extent  that the family court's conclusions 
above are mixed findings of fact and conclusions of law, they 
are not clearly erroneous. The  family court properly considered 
the factors set forth by HRS § 580-47(a)  (2018), and the record 
evidence,  in determining that  spousal support was warranted. On 
that basis, the family court concluded that the relative length of the marriage, Wife's advanced age, her lack of employment 
prospects, and Wife's limited social security income and 
16   
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
inability to cover her own expenses , all weigh in favor of 
spousal support. We determine that the family court did not 
abuse its discretion in awarding spousal support to Wife for the 
duration of Husband's life time. 
(4) Husband contends that the family court abused its 
discretion in awarding attorney's fees and costs to Wife. "[A]n 
award of attorney's fees is in the sound discretion of the trial 
court, limited only by the standard that it be fair and 
reasonable." Id.  (quoting Farias v. Farias, 58 Haw. 227, 233, 
566 P.2d 1104, 1109 (1977)).  
HRS § 580 -47(a) states, in pertinent part, 
Upon granting a divorce, or thereafter if, in addition to 
the powers granted in subsections (c) and (d), jurisdiction 
of those matters is reserved under the decree by agreement 
of both parties or by order of court after finding that 
good cause exists, the court may make any further orders as 
shall appear just and equitable . . . (4) allocating, as 
between the parties, the responsibility for the payment of 
the debts of the parties . . . and the attorney's fees, 
costs, and expenses incurred by each party by r eason of the 
divorce. In making these further orders, the court shall 
take into consideration: the respective merits of the 
parties, the relative abilities of the parties, the 
condition in which each party will be left by the divorce 
. . . and all other circumstances of the case . 
(Emphasis added). 
The record reflects that the family court considered 
the factors in HRS § 580-47(a) in determining  that an award of 
attorney's fees to Wife was supported by the circumstances of 
the case.   The family court specifically concluded that "the 
parties' attorney's fees and costs shall be equalized[,]" such

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that "[t]he party who incurred more [in attorney's fees between 
May 1,  2016 through January 4, 2019] will then owe and be 
required to pay the other party one-half (1/2) of the difference between what each party incurred."   Moreover, the family court 
8 
8 The family court explained, 
249. The Court finds [Wife's] request for equalization to 
be fair and reasonable based on the following: 
a. The number of filings in this matter is 
voluminous. As of September 18, 2018, five 
hundred and forty -six (546) documents ha d been 
filed in this matter. For this Court to have to 
review and sort through over two (2) years of 
litigation documents to determine whether, and to 
what extent, one party should pay the other 
party's attorney's fees and costs is both 
unreasonable and im practical. 
b. There is nothing in the record to suggest that 
[Wife's] four (4) requests for contributions to 
her legal expenses in this case were unreasonable. 
In each of the four (4) orders related to her 
requests, her payment was not characterized as an 
advance on property division, the receipt of her 
payment was not conditioned upon a further showing 
of good cause, she was not cautioned about her use 
of the funds, and her use of the payment for her 
attorney's fees and costs was not limited in any 
respect. 
c. Each party had the opportunity to request, and in 
some instances did request, that the other party 
be responsible for the attorney's fees and costs 
incurred by the requesting party. 
d. [Husband] has controlled almost all of the marital 
assets and has been able to pay his attorney's 
fees and costs without limiting it to a specific 
amount and without first seeking a Court order. 
It is not fair or reasonable that either party be 
allowed to substantially reduce the value of the 
marital estate to the detriment of the other 
through unlimited spending on attorney's fees and 
costs.

separately awarded Wife her attorney's fees and costs for 
Husband's First Motion to Bifurcate, which the family court 
found "caused  unnecessary time and expense."   We conclude that 
the family court's FOF, upon which its award of attorney's fees and costs were based, were not clearly erroneous. We further 
conclude that the family court's conclusions of law were not 
wrong. The  family court did not abuse its discretion in 
granting Wife attorney's fees  and costs.  9
8(. . . continued) 
e. By sharing equally in the reduction of the value 
of the marital estate, neither party will have 
gained a benefit to the detriment of the other 
party through his or her expenditure of a greater 
amount of money for his or her attorney's fees and 
costs. The value of the marital estate has been 
reduced by t he expenditure of money for attorney's 
fees and costs, and it is fair and reasonable that 
each party is charged with one -half (1/2) of that 
reduction. 
9 The family court found that, 
251. The Court has carefully reviewed [Wife's] six (6) 
specific requests for attorney's fees and costs related 
to identified actions taken by [Husband]. The Court 
addresses only one of the specific requests, and denies 
the rest. 
 . . . . 
264. The Court finds that [Husband 's] First Motion to 
Bifurcate caused unnecessary time and expense on the 
claimed bases that bifurcation was warranted due to his 
serious health care challenges, threats to his emotional 
well-being, and the possibility of death from stress -
claims he eventual ly dropped after not providing court -
ordered medical records and information to support his 
claim.
