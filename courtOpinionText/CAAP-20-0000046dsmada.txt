IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I  
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
FRANCIS A. GRANDINETTI, also known as ALBERT FERNANDEZ,
also known as FRANK MYERS, also known as FRANK IRANDINE,
Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 3PC930000141) 
ORDER 
DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
AND 
DISMISSING ALL PENDING MOTIONS AS MOOT 
(By: 
Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
jurisdiction over the appeal that Defendant-Appellant Francis A. 
Grandinetti (Grandinetti) has asserted, apparently from a 
decision by the Hawai# i Paroling Authority regarding the sentence 
that Grandinetti is currently serving for his November 8, 1993 
conviction in Circuit Court Criminal Case Number 3PC930000141 for 
one count of forgery in the second degree in violation of Hawaii 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 708-852 (1993) and three counts of theft 
in the second degree in violation of HRS § 708-831 (1993). 
"The right of appeal in a criminal case is purely 
statutory[.]" State v. Nicol, 140 Hawai# i 482, 485, 403 P.3d NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
259, 262 (2017) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
In circuit court criminal cases, a defendant may appeal from a 
judgment of conviction pursuant to HRS § 641-11 (2016), a 
certified interlocutory order pursuant to HRS § 641-17 (1016), 
"or from an interlocutory order denying a motion to dismiss based 
on double jeopardy." State v. Kealaiki, 95 Hawai# i 309, 312, 22 
P.3d 588, 591 (2001) (citation omitted). 
However, there is no 
statutory authority for defendant to appeal from a decision by 
the Hawai# i Paroling Authority directly to the Hawai# i 
Intermediate Court of Appeals. 
The statute that governs the Hawai# i Paroling 
Authority's procedure for considering parole is HRS § 706-670 (2014). 
HRS § 706-670 does not authorize an appeal from a 
Hawai# i Paroling Authority decision directly to this court. The 
Supreme Court of Hawai# i and this court have acknowledged that 
the appropriate means for a criminal defendant to challenge the Hawai# i Paroling Authority's decision to deny parole is by 
petitioning a circuit court for post-conviction relief in a special proceeding pursuant to Rule 40 of the Hawai# i Rules of 
Penal Procedure (HRPP). Williamson v. Hawai# i Paroling 
Authority, 97 Hawai# i 183, 194-95, 35 P.3d 210, 221-22 (2001); 
Turner v. Hawai# i Paroling Authority, 93 Hawai# i 298, 307, 1 P.3d 
768, 777 (App. 2000). After the circuit court adjudicates the 
HRPP Rule 40 petition for post-conviction relief, the criminal defendant can appeal from the circuit court's judgment directly 
to the Hawai# i Intermediate Court of Appeals pursuant to HRS 
§ 641-11 and HRPP Rule 40(h). Grattafiori v. State, 79 Hawai# i 
10, 13, 897 P.2d 937, 940 (1995). 
The record does not show that 
Grandinetti has sought judicial review of the Hawai# i Paroling 
Authority's decision by way of a petition to the circuit court 
for post-conviction relief pursuant to HRPP Rule 40. Absent an 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appealable judgment or order, we lack jurisdiction over this 
appeal by Grandinetti. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court 
case number CAAP-20-0000046 is dismissed for lack of appellate 
jurisdiction. 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions 
in appellate court case number CAAP-20-0000046 are dismissed as 
moot.
