IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
IN THE INTEREST OF DA, A Minor. 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
(FC-S NO. 19-00014) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that: 
(1)
 On or about January 23, 2020, self-represented 
Father-Appellant NA (Father) mailed the notice of appeal to the 
Hawai# i Supreme Court; 
(2)
 The appellate clerk received the notice of appeal 
on January 27, 2020, and electronically filed it to create this appeal on January 29, 2020; 
(3) On March 30, 2020, the circuit court clerk filed 
the record on appeal, and the appellate clerk notified the parties that the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief were due on or before April 6, 2020, and April 29, 2020, respectively; 
(4) Father failed to file either document or timely 
request an extension; 
(5)
 On May 21, 2020, the appellate clerk notified 
Father that the time for filing the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief had expired, the matter would be called to the court's attention on June 1, 2020, for appropriate action, which could include dismissal of the appeal, under 
Hawai# i Rules of NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rules 12.1(e) and 30, and Father could 
request relief from default by motion; 
(6) On June 1, 2020, Father filed what the court 
construed as a motion for relief from default and first extension of time for the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief; 
(7) On June 17, 2020, the court granted Father's 
June 1, 2020 motion and extended the deadline to file the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief to July 17, 2020. The court cautioned Father that any further default of the statement of jurisdiction or opening brief may result in sanctions authorized by HRAP Rules 12.1(e) and 30, including, without limitation, the appeal being dismissed; and 
(8) Father failed to file either document or request 
another extension of time, and therefore is in default of the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief for a second time in this appeal. Under the circumstances, dismissal of the appeal is warranted. See HRAP Rules 12.1(e) & 30. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, June 9, 2021.
