DEMI NOHEA HO, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
HONOLULU DIVISION 
(CASE NO. 1DTC-18-025046) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Ginoza, C.J., and Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Demi Nohea Ho (Ho) appeals from the 
Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, 
entered on January 9, 2020, in the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division (District Court
). Following a bench 
trial, Ho was convicted of Operating a Vehicle After License and Privilege Have Been Suspended or Revoked for Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVLPSR), in violation of 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-62(a)(1) and/or (a)(2) 
(Supp. 2017).
2/ 1/
1/ The Honorable Alvin K. Nishimura presided. 
2/ HRS § 291E-62(a) provides, in relevant part: 
Operating a vehicle after license and privilege have been
suspended or revoked for operating a vehicle under theinfluence of an intoxicant; penalties. (a) No person whose
license and privilege to operate a vehicle have beenrevoked, suspended, or otherwise restricted pursuant to thissection or to part III or section 291E-61 or 291E-61.5, orto part VII or part XIV of chapter 286 or section 200-81,291-4, 291-4.4, 291-4.5, or 291-7 as those provisions werein effect on December 31, 2001, shall operate or assumeactual physical control of any vehicle:  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
On appeal, Ho contends that: (1) the District Court 
erroneously admitted Exhibit 2, a certified traffic abstract 
(Abstract), and Exhibit 3, a Notice of Administrative Review 
Decision (ADLRO Notice);3/ (2) the admission of the Abstract and 
the ADLRO Notice violated Ho's confrontation rights; and (3) 
there was insufficient evidence to support Ho's conviction because: (a) Exhibits 2 and 3 were erroneously admitted; (b) the State failed to prove that Ho was the person in the ADLRO Notice; and (c) the State failed to adduce substantial evidence that Ho acted with the requisite state of mind.
4/ 
After reviewing the record on appeal and the relevant 
legal authorities, and giving due consideration to the issues raised and the arguments advanced by the parties, we resolve Ho's contentions as follows and affirm. 
(1) and (2) Ho contends that the District Court 
improperly admitted the Abstract and the ADLRO Notice, which she asserts "were not competent evidence to prove that [Ho's] license had been administratively revoked." Ho also contends that admission of the Abstract and the ADLRO Notice violated her confrontation rights. 
The Abstract 
At trial, Ho objected to the admission of the Abstract 
as follows: 
[DEPUTY PROSECUTING ATTORNEY ( DPA)]: . . . I'm 
showing defense counsel what has been marked as State's
Exhibit No. 2 for identification. . . . It is the certified traffic abstract from the District Court of the First Circuit, State of Hawai #i. 
(1) In violation of any restrictions placed on the
person's license; [or] 
(2) While the person's license or privilege to
operate a vehicle remains suspended orrevoked[.] 
3/   ADLRO refers to the Administrative Driver's License Revocation 
Office. 
4/   Ho's points of error have been restated and reorganized for 
clarity.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
And we would like to note that the defendant's 
name is on the certified traffic, as well as the date
of birth that Officer Gazelle just stated, . . . and[the] last four digits of her Social Security . . . . 
. . . . 
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: 
And I'm going to object, if she's
going to enter into evidence. Lack of foundation. 
. . . . 
THE COURT: 
All right. The Court will receive State's 
Exhibit 2 into evidence. 
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I'm just going to ask the Court to
make a finding as to under what exception. Or, I mean, howthe State has laid foundation, I should say. Whether or not it's going to acknowledge that it's a public record or--
THE COURT: Well, it's a certified document from the
court, right? 
[DPA]: Yes. . . . 
THE COURT: Okay. I think what counsel is asking, if
you can point to the proper hearsay exception that allows
this document to come in. 
[DPA]: Your Honor, we would refer to Hawai #i Rules of 
Evidence [( HRE)] 902, subsection (5), self authentication.
It's an official publication by this -- issued. . . . 
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, I am going to object,
because what it is is a printout that is made and generated.And then subsequently gets certified. 
So it is not an 
actual judgment by the Court in terms of the revocation,because the revocation was done at ADLRO. All it is is reflecting something, some information that was conveyed tothe Court. 
So the information that the State is trying to use in
order to establish an element or a fact 
is technically
hearsay that's contained in this particular abstract,because the revocation was not done by this Court. It's different from a judgment. . . . 
THE COURT: 
I understand. So you're saying this --
the more direct evidence of the revocation would be the notification from the ADLRO? 
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, the fact that the revocation
was done by a different body, in and of itself. 
. . . . 
THE COURT: 
And does the State have that document? 
[DPA]: Yes, Your Honor. . . . 
. . . . 
THE COURT: 
The Court will receive State's Exhibit 2 
in at this point, over defense objection. 
(Emphases added.) 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
As reflected in this transcript, Ho first objected to 
the admission of the Abstract due to "lack of foundation." "[A] 
'lack of foundation' objection generally is insufficient to preserve foundational issues for appeal because such an objection does not advise the trial court of the problems with the foundation." State v. Long, 98 Hawai# i 348, 353, 48 P.3d 595, 
600 (2002). "[A]n exception is recognized when the objection is overruled and, based on the context, it is evident what the general objection was meant to convey." Id.Here, based on Ho's 
reference to an "exception" and "a public record," the District Court appears to have reasonably construed Ho's objection to the admission of the Abstract as a hearsay objection. 
On appeal, Ho contends that the Abstract was 
"inadmissible as it was not the 'best evidence' to confirm that [Ho's] license had been administratively revoked[.]" 
Relatedly, 
Ho argues that "the only 'foundation' adduced by the State for admission of the certified traffic abstract was the certification of the 'Clerk, District Court of the First Circuit, State of Hawaii' that 'I hereby certify that the information provided herein is extracted from the official records of the District Courts of the State of Hawaii.'" Ho also contends that admission of the Abstract violated her confrontation rights. 
We need not address Ho's arguments regarding the 
Abstract for two reasons. 
First, Ho did not object at trial to 
admission of the Abstract based on the "best evidence" rule (see HRE Rules 1001-1008) or the certification contained in the Abstract. Nor did Ho assert her confrontation rights with regard to the Abstract. These arguments are thus deemed waived. See 
State v. Engelby, 147 Hawai# i 222, 232-33, 465 P.3d 669, 679-80 
(2020) (citing Kobashigawa v. Silver, 129 Hawai# i 313, 322, 300 
P.3d 579, 588 (2013); State v. Kony, 138 Hawai# i 1, 10-11, 375 
P.3d 1239, 1248-49 (2016)); HRE Rule 103(a)(1). 
Second, the 
Abstract is cumulative with regard to the OVLPSR charge, as the ALDRO Notice (discussed infra
) by itself sufficiently shows that 
Ho's license was administratively revoked when she drove. See 
State v. Kaaikala, No. CAAP-18-0000931, 2021 WL 2416739, at *3 (Haw. App. June 14, 2021) (SDO) (citing HRS § 291E-62(a) and 
4      
 
 
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
noting that it "prohibit[s] from driving any 'person whose 
license and privilege to operate a vehicle have been revoked, suspended, or otherwise restricted' pursuant to, inter alia, an ADLRO administrative proceeding"). 
The ADLRO Notice 
At trial, Ho objected to the admission of the ADLRO 
Notice as follows: 
[DPA]: . . . . 
. . . Your Honor, if the record could also indicate
that I'm showing defense counsel what has been marked for
identification as State's Exhibit 3, a Notice ofAdministrative Review Decision, dated from the DistrictCourt of the First Circuit, State of Hawai #i, saying that
defendant's Hawai #i license and privilege to operate a
vehicle was revoked from October 14, 2017 to October 13,2018. 
THE COURT: And this is marked as Exhibit? 
[DPA]: 
No. 3, Your Honor. 
THE COURT: Okay. [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And I'm going to object to lack of
foundation. State v. Fields
.5/ 
THE COURT: Okay. Any response to the defense
objection? 
[DPA]: Your Honor, the State would argue that this is
a certified document that is produced by the administrative
driver's license revocation. It's the notice of the decision that was made. And it's also certified by thatbody. 
THE COURT: Okay. 
The Court, over objection, will
receive State's Exhibit 3. 
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And just let me -- in terms of
elaborate on my objection, because based on State v. Fields,there still needs to be some sort of custodian of records that has to come in order 
to lay the foundation for that. 
And we have a right to confront in terms of admission ofthat particular document. But I'm just -- this is for therecord. 
[DPA]: And, Your Honor, at this time the State would
argue that the records are kept because the law requires it,under HRS 286-118 and HRS 286-101. So it's not beingcreated in anticipation of litigation. 
THE COURT: 
Okay. Anything else? 
5/ In State v. Fields, 115 Hawai #i 503, 168 P.3d 955 (2007), the
supreme court addressed the admissibility of hearsay statements under theConfrontation Clause of the Hawai #i Constitution. 
5  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
[DPA]: No. 
THE COURT: The Court will receive it into 
evidence. 
(Emphasis and footnote added.) 
On appeal, Ho argues that the ADLRO Notice was not 
competent evidence that her license had been revoked because it 
was not a final decision. Ho did not object at trial to admission of the ADLRO Notice on this basis, and her argument is thus deemed waived. See Engelby, 147 Hawai# i at 232-33, 465 P.3d 
at 679-80. 
Relying on Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 557 U.S. 305 
(2009), and Fields, 115 Hawai# i 503, 168 P.3d 955, Ho further 
argues that the ADLRO Notice was admitted "in violation of [her] constitutional rights to confrontation and due process."
6/ We 
recently considered a similar argument in Kaaikala, 2021 WL 2416739, at *3-4. We analyzed the issue and ruled as follows: 
To determine whether the source of a document introduced at 
trial is subject to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment,the court must determine whether the document is "testimonial" in nature. State v. Fitzwater, 122 Hawai #i 
354, 371, 227 P.3d 520, 537 (2010). A clerk's certificate 
of authentication for a business record is not testimonial 
in nature and therefore does not implicate the right of
confrontation. State v. Cruz
, 135 Hawai #i 294, 297, 349
P.3d 401, 404 (App. 2015) (citing Melendez-Diaz v.Massachusetts, 557 U.S. 305, 321-22 (2009)). 
Similarly, the
certification of an ADLRO decision by its custodian ofrecords does not implicate the Confrontation Clause. State 
v. Philling, No. CAAP-18-0000653, 2019 WL 6790773, at *5(Haw. App. Dec. 12, 2019) (SDO) (holding that a defendant'sright of confrontation was not implicated by admission ofcertified copies of ADLRO decisions offered to show theoutcome of prior ADLRO proceedings); see also Fitzwater, 122Hawai #i at 374, 227 P.3d at 540 (holding that a speed check
card created in a non-adversarial setting in the regularcourse of maintaining a police vehicle, five months beforethe subject speeding incident, was not testimonial in natureand its admission did not violate the defendant's right toconfrontation under the Sixth Amendment). Here, thecertification of the ADLRO Notice only authenticates thatdocument, and the ADLRO Notice was created in the regularcourse of an unrelated prior ADLRO proceeding more thanthree months before the incident in this case. 
Thus, the
ADLRO Notice and the certification on that document are not testimonial in nature and do not implicate the ConfrontationClause under the Sixth Amendment. 
6/ Because Ho did not invoke due process at trial, her argument based
on due process is deemed waived. 
6   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
With regard to his confrontation rights under the Hawai #i 
Constitution, Kaaikala cites State v. Fields, 115 Hawai #i 
503, 528, 168 P.3d 955, 980 (2007), and urges this court to
apply the test articulated in Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56(1980) (abrogated by Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36(2004)), which he contends requires a showing that (1) thedeclarant is unavailable, and (2) the statement bears someindicia of reliability, and that the State failed to satisfyeither element at trial. However, this court rejected thesame argument in State v. Choi, No. CAAP-16-0000765, 2020 WL419629, at *2 (App. Jan. 27, 2020) (SDO), holding that the
Roberts test applies " only when the challenged out-of-court
statements were made in the course of a prior judicial
proceeding" and that when hearsay qualifies for a "firmlyrooted exception to the hearsay rule, the ConfrontationClause is satisfied." (Citing State v. Ofa, 9 Haw. App.130, 138, 828 P.2d 813, 818 (1992)) (emphasis added)); seealso State v. Rodrigues, 7 Haw. App. 80, 85, 742 P.2d 986,990 (1987) (holding that Roberts applies only "when the
prosecution seeks to admit testimony from a prior judicial
proceeding in place of live testimony at trial") (quoting
United States v. Inadi, 475 U.S. 387, 393 (1986)) (emphasis
added). 
. . . Thus, we conclude the Roberts test does not apply with
regard to the certification and the ADLRO Notice. [Ofa, 9Haw. App. at 138, 828 P.2d at 818.] 
Id. 
The same reasoning applies here. The certification of 
the ADLRO Notice only authenticates that document, which was 
created in the regular course of an unrelated prior ADLRO proceeding more than seven months before the incident in this case. See id.; see also Philling, 2019 WL 6790773, at *5 ("Here, 
the ADLRO Decisions are official records of the outcome of prior ADLRO proceedings and were not prepared specifically for use at Philling's trial in this case. Although the underlying proceedings were confrontational in nature, the certified copies of the ADLRO Decisions were offered to prove the fact of the prior revocations, but were not offered to prove the facts supporting the ADLRO Decisions." (citing State v. Samonte, 83 Hawai#i 507, 534-38, 928 P.2d 1, 28-32 (1996))).
7/ Accordingly, 
admission of the ADLRO Notice did not violate Ho's confrontation rights. 
7/ It also appears that the State introduced the ADLRO Notice as a
self-authenticating, certified public record under HRE Rule 902. As such, the
ADLRO Notice was admissible under the HRE Rule 803(b)(8) public recordshearsay exception, which is a "firmly rooted hearsay exception." Kaaikala,
2021 WL 2416739, at *4.

(3) Ho contends there was insufficient evidence to 
support her conviction, in part because "[t]he State failed to 
adduce substantial evidence that [Ho] was the person identified in the [A]bstract and [ADLRO Notice]." 
The Hawai# i Supreme Court has made clear: 
[E]vidence adduced in the trial court must be considered in
the strongest light for the prosecution when the appellatecourt passes on the legal sufficiency of such evidence tosupport a conviction; the same standard applies whether thecase was before a judge or a jury. The test on appeal isnot whether guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt,but whether there was substantial evidence to support theconclusion of the trier of fact. . . . 
"Substantial evidence" as to every material element ofthe offense charged is credible evidence which is ofsufficient quality and probative value to enable [aperson] of reasonable caution to support a conclusion.And as trier of fact, the trial judge is free to makeall reasonable and rational inferences under the facts in evidence, including circumstantial evidence. 
State v. Matavale, 115 Hawai# i 149, 157-58, 166 P.3d 322, 
330-31 (2007) (quoting State v. Batson, 73 Haw. 236, 248-49, 831 
P.2d 924, 931 (1992)). 
Here, at trial, Officer Darren K. Sunada (Officer 
Sunada) identified Ho as the person whose vehicle he stopped on 
April 21, 2018. Officer Sunada testified that Ho was unable to 
produce a driver's license or any up-to-date insurance documents and instead provided her Hawai# i identification card and verbally 
provided her entire Social Security number. Based on this information, Officer Sunada "ran checks in [his] department-issued mobile data computer," which brought to his attention "that [Ho's] Hawai
#i license status was actively revoked, under 
our AR, Administrative Revocation." Additionally, HPD Officer Arthur Gazelle (Officer Gazelle) testified that he was involved 
in Ho's prior arrest on September 13, 2017 for Operating a 
Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII) and 
identified Ho in court. Officer Gazelle testified that at the 
time of that arrest, he completed and signed a Notice of Administrative Revocation (Revocation Notice),
8/ and "then had 
[Ho] sign the last page" in his presence. The Revocation Notice, 
8/ Ho did not object to the admission of the Revocation Notice into
evidence.

the Abstract, and the ADLRO Notice all contained consistent 
identifying information, including the same name, driver's license permit number, last four digits of social security number, and police report number. This evidence, along with the two officers' testimony, was sufficient to identify Ho as the same person whose license had been revoked. See State v. Rios, 
No. CAAP-19-0000718, 2021 WL 964862, at *2 (Haw. App. March 15, 2021) (SDO (concluding that similar evidence was sufficient to identify the defendant as the same person whose license was revoked). 
Ho further contends that "[t]he State failed to adduce 
substantial evidence that [Ho] was aware that her license was revoked at the time of the incident." 
Because the state of mind required to establish an 
offense under HRS § 291E-62(a) is not specified in the statute, the State was required to prove that Ho acted intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly with respect to each element of the offense. See Rios, 2021 WL 964862, at *2 (applying HRS § 702-204 
(2014)).
9/ "[G]iven the difficulty of proving the requisite state 
of mind by direct evidence in criminal cases, we have consistently held that proof by circumstantial evidence and reasonable inferences arising from circumstances surrounding the defendant's conduct is sufficient." State v. Stocker, 90 Hawai# i 
85, 92, 976 P.2d 399, 406 (1999) (original brackets, ellipsis, and internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting State v. Mitsuda, 86 Hawai# i 37, 44, 947 P.2d 349, 356 (1997)). 
Here, Officer Gazelle testified that on September 13, 
2017, when Ho was arrested for OVUII, she did not have a driver's license and had only an expired Hawai# i permit. Officer Gazelle 
explained to Ho that under normal circumstances, if she were licensed, the Revocation Notice would have served as a temporary 
9/ "A person acts recklessly with respect to attendant circumstances
when he consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such
circumstances exist." HRS § 702-206(3)(b) (2014). "A risk is substantial and unjustifiable within the meaning of this section if, considering the natureand purpose of the person's conduct and the circumstances known to him, thedisregard of the risk involves a gross deviation from the standard of conductthat a law-abiding person would observe in the same situation." HRS § 702-206(3)(d). 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
permit; however, in this case, it would not serve as a permit 
because Ho was unlicensed. Officer Gazelle also noted that he selected the option on the form reflecting Ho's current license status which stated: "This IS NOT a Temporary Permit" and explained to Ho "this is not a permit. You cannot drive, because you were -- you're not licensed to drive." Officer Gazelle notified Ho that she would receive a copy of the administrative review decision and asked her if she had any questions. The Revocation Notice also stated: "The administrative review decision shall be mailed to you: (a) No later than eight days after the date of the issuance of this Notice in the case of an alcohol related offense[.]" The subsequently issued ADLRO Notice stated: "Your license and privilege to operate a vehicle are
revoked from 10/14/17 to 10/13/18." (Emphasis in original.) 
We conclude there was substantial evidence that Ho 
consciously disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk that 
her license was revoked when she operated a motor vehicle and was stopped by Officer Sunada, even if, as Ho asserts, there was no direct evidence that she actually received a copy of the ADLRO Notice. See State v. Lioen, 106 Hawai# i 123, 132, 102 P.3d 367, 
376 (App. 2004) (concluding that a person "who knows his license has been revoked or suspended for DUI-alcohol or DUI-drugs in the past and knows he does not have a valid driver's license, acts recklessly if he drives without determining whether his license remains suspended or revoked for DUI-alcohol or DUI-drugs"); see also State v. Alesana, No. CAAP-19-0000612, 2021 WL 1694869, at *4 (Haw. App. April 29, 2021) (SDO) ("Alesana consciously disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk that his license was revoked when he operated a moped and was stopped by Officer Carlbom, even if there was no proof that Alesana actually received a copy of the Notice of Administrative Review Decision."); Rios, 2021 WL 964862, *2 (determining that the defendant "consciously disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk that his license was revoked when he drove his car five months later when he was stopped and arrested by Officer Borowski . . . even though there was no direct evidence that Rios was aware that his license had been revoked[.]").
