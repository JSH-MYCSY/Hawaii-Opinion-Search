OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
RAYMOND V. RAMES, Claimant-Appellant-Appellant, v.
STARWOOD HOTELS AND RESORTS WORLDWIDE, INC.,
Employer-Appellee-Appellee, and SEDGWICK CMS-HAWAII,
Insurance Carrier-Appellee-Appellee
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
(CASE NO. AB 2019-011(K); DCD NO. 4-10-00380)
ORDER GRANTING JUNE 16, 2020 MOTION TO
DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Wadsworth, JJ.)
Upon review of (1) Employer/Appellee/Appellee Starwood
Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, Inc. ( Starwood Hotels ), and
Insurance Carrier/Appellee/Appellee Sedgwick CMS-Hawaii's
(Sedgwick) June 16, 2020 motion to dismiss appeal for lack of
appellate jurisdiction (Motion to Dismiss ), (2) the lack of any
memorandum by Claimant/Appellant/Appellant Raymond V. Rames
(Rames), self-represented, in response to the Motion to Dismiss,
(3) Rames's Jurisdictional Statement filed on June 26, 2020, and
(4) the record, it appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction
over Rames's appeal from the Labor and Industrial Relations
Appeals Board's ( LIRAB) January 7, 2020 decision and order1
1The Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board (the LIRAB) was
composed of Chair Danny J. Vasconcellos, who recused himself, and Member
Melanie S. Matsui and Member Marie C.L. Laderta. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
regarding Rames's claim for workers' compensation benefits,
because Rames's appeal is untimely.
The LIRAB's January 7, 2020 decision and order finally
determined Rames's claims for certain workers' compensation
benefits, and thus, ended the proceedings in LIRAB Case No. AB
2019-011(K) leaving nothing further for the LIRAB to accomplish
in that particular proceeding.  Consequently, the LIRAB's
January 7, 2020 decision and order is an appealable final order
pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS ) § 386-88 (2015), HRS
§ 91-14(a) (2012 & Supp. 2019), and the holdings in Bocalbos v.
Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children, 89 Hawai# i 436,
443, 974 P.2d 1026, 1033 (1999) and Lindinha v. Hilo Coast
Processing Co., 104 Hawai#i 164, 168, 86 P.3d 973, 977 (2004).
However, Rames did not file his notice of appeal, which
was received by the LIRAB on February 10, 2020, within thirty
days after the LIRAB mailed its January 7, 2020 decision and
order on the day it was issued.  HRS § 386-88 provides in
pertinent part:
The decision or order of the appellate board shall be final
and conclusive, except as provided in section 386-89, unless
within thirty days after mailing of a certified copy of the
decision or order, the director or any other party appeals
to the intermediate appellate court, subject to chapter 602,
by filing a written notice of appeal with the appellate
board, or by electronically filing a notice of appeal in
accordance with the Hawaii rules of appellate procedure.
(Emphasis added).  Here, Rames mailed his notice of appeal to the
LIRAB and did not electronically file his notice of appeal.  We
note that Rames's notice of appeal contains a file-stamp dated
February 5, 2020, which is difficult to read but which Starwood
Hotels and Sedgwick assert is a file-stamp from the Kauai
Disability Compensation Division office.  Even if Rames filed his
notice of appeal at the Kauai Disability Compensation Division
office on February 5, 2020, this would not meet the requirements
under HRS § 386-88 for "filing a written notice of appeal with
the appellate board[.]"  Pursuant to HRS § 386-1 (2015),
"[a]ppellate board" is defined as "the labor and industrial
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
relations appeals board."  Further, we find no authority allowing
for ex officio filing at the Kauai Disability Compensation
Division office for purposes of HRS § 386-88.
Given the above, Rames's notice of appeal is untimely
under HRS § 386-88.  The failure to file a timely notice of
appeal in a civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the
parties cannot waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in
the exercise of judicial discretion.  Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw.
648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986).
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Starwood Hotels
and Sedgwick's June 16, 2020 motion to dismiss appeal for lack of
appellate jurisdiction is granted, and case number CAAP-20-
0000071 is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, June 30, 2020.
