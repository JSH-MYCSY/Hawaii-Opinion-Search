Yamashita appeals from: (1) the "Order of Resentencing; Revoca-
tion of Probation; Notice of Entry" (Order of Resentencing) 
entered in 2CPC-17-0000133 (the First Case) on May 31, 2019;
(2) the "Judgment; Conviction and Sentence; Notice of Entry" 
entered in each of the other seven cases (the Other Cases) on NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
May 31, 2019 (collectively, Judgments); and (3) the "Findings of 
Fact and Conclusions of Law; Order Granting in Part and Denying 
in Part Defendant's Motion to Reconsider Sentence" entered in all eight cases on January 15, 2020 (collectively, Reconsideration 
Orders).
1 For the reasons explained below, we affirm the Order 
of Resentencing, the Judgments, and the Reconsideration Orders. 
BACKGROUND 
In the First Case, Yamashita was charged with Unautho-
rized Control of Propelled Vehicle in violation of Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS) § 708-836. He pleaded no contest. On August 23, 
2017, he was convicted and sentenced to four years of probation, 
with the special condition that he serve 55 days in prison with credit for time served.
2 He was also ordered to pay $1,000 in 
punitive restitution to the clerk of the court, $105 in Crime Victim Compensation (CVC) fees, $150 as a Probation Service Fee, 
and $100 as an Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) fee. 
Between November 20, 2017, and October 30, 2018, 
Yamashita was charged with various offenses in the seven Other 
Cases. He entered pleas of not guilty in all of the cases except 2CPC-18-0000828 (the Last Case). On November 2, 2018, before the 
arraignment and plea hearing in the Last Case, Yamashita entered 
into a global plea agreement with the State. Yamashita pleaded no contest or admitted to 26 counts in the Other Cases; the remaining counts were dismissed with prejudice. Under the plea agreement, Yamashita also admitted to violating the terms and conditions of probation in the First Case, and agreed to be resentenced. 
On May 31, 2019, the circuit court entered the Order of 
Resentencing in the First Case. Yamashita's probation was revoked; he was resentenced to serve five years of incarceration with credit for time served, and to pay $1,000 in restitution as

being appealed. 
2 The Honorable Richard T. Bissen, Jr. signed the judgment. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 a free-standing order, $105 as a CVC fee, and $100 as an ICAC 
fee. In the Other Cases, the circuit court entered the Judgments; Yamashita was sentenced to various periods of incarceration, the longest of which was five years, all to be served concurrently with each other and with the sentence in the First Case. In the Other Cases the circuit court also sentenced Yamashita to pay a total of $1,710 in fines; $8,767.20 in resti-tution; $2,075 in CVC fees; $2,500 in ICAC fees; and $100 as a Drug Demand Reduction (DDR) assessment. 
On July 28, 2019, Yamashita filed a motion to recon-
sider his sentence in each of the eight cases. On January 15, 2020, the circuit court entered the Reconsideration Orders. The circuit court waived payment of the ICAC fees in the Other Cases, but otherwise denied reconsideration. 
This appeal followed. 
STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A. Sentencing 
A judge has broad discretion in matters related to
sentencing. Accordingly, a trial court's sentencing or re-
sentencing determination will not be disturbed absent aplain and manifest abuse of discretion in its decision. The trial court abuses its discretion when it clearly exceedsthe bounds of reason or disregards rules or principles oflaw or practice to the substantial detriment of a partylitigant.

up). 
B. Findings of Fact 
We review the circuit court's findings of fact under 
the clearly erroneous standard. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when the record lacks substantial evidence to support the finding, or despite the evidence to support the finding, we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. Pulgados, 2020 WL 6375183, at *3. "[U]nchallenged findings of fact are binding upon this court."

C. Conclusions of Law 
A [conclusion of law] is not binding upon an
appellate court and is freely reviewable for its
correctness. This court ordinarily reviews[conclusions of law] under the right/wrong standard.Thus, a [conclusion of law] that is supported by thetrial court's findings of fact and that reflects anapplication of the correct rule of law will not beoverturned. However, a [conclusion of law] thatpresents mixed questions of fact and law is reviewedunder the clearly erroneous standard because thecourt's conclusions are dependent upon the facts andcircumstances of each individual case.

D. Constitutionality of Statutes 
The constitutionality of a statute is a question of
law which is reviewable under the right/wrong standard.Additionally, where it is alleged that the legislature hasacted unconstitutionally, this court has consistently heldthat every enactment of the legislature is presumptivelyconstitutional, and a party challenging the statute has theburden of showing unconstitutionality beyond a reasonabledoubt. The infraction should be plain, clear, manifest, andunmistakable.

DISCUSSION 
Yamashita contends that the circuit court erred by:
(1)
 concluding that he will be able to pay the CVC fees and DDR
assessment; and (2)  imposing the CVC fees and DDR assessment 
pursuant to an unconstitutional delegation of the legislature's
taxation power.

(4) The number of victims; and 
(5) The defendant's earning capacity, includingfuture earning capacity. 
(c) The compensation fee shall be considered a civil
judgment. 
(Underscoring added.) 
Yamashita argues that the circuit court should not have 
imposed CVC fees upon him because he "is impoverished" and 
"indigent." But he has not challenged the following findings of fact, which are binding on him and upon us: 
15. On October 28, 2019, [Yamashita] testified that
he was twenty-nine (29) years old and incarcerated at Halawa
Correctional Facility (hereinafter referred to as "Halawa"),where he had been for the past year. 
16. [Yamashita] further testified that he was single
with two daughters, had the equivalent of a high schooldiploma (hereinafter referred to as "GED"), and that hislast paying job outside of prison was with a roofing companyin 2015. 
17. According to [Yamashita]'s Application for Legal
Services (Defense's A received into evidence at thehearing), [Yamashita] currently received approximately $100per month from his mother into his income account at Halawa.He also earned approximately $15-$20 per month from workingfor 25 cents per hour for approximately 35 hours per week ina plumbing job at the facility. In sum, his monthly incomeat the time of his testimony was between $115 and $120. 
18. Also provided by [Yamashita] in his testimony
and as part of Defense's A was his liabilities. [Yamashita]testified to paying $100 per month for child supportpayments and $30 per month for restitution, fines, and feesrelated to the cases for which he is serving the five (5) 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
year prison term. He testified that other than these debts,
he had no other expenses. 
19. [Yamashita] testified that his account at Halawa
does not have money left over in it after the withdrawalsfor child support payments, restitution, fines, and fees inhis criminal cases. He testified that he had no other assets than his income. 
20. [Yamashita] testified that he voluntarily
applied for his plumbing job at Halawa because he wanted towork. 
21. [Yamashita] testified that he was in good health
and faced no kind of medical issue that would prevent himfrom working. He further testified that if he should be released from prison or placed on parole it would be hisintent and within his capacity to work full time and supporthis two daughters and pay his Court ordered restitution,fines, and fees. 
Yamashita also does not challenge conclusion of law (COL) no. 14, 
which is actually a finding of fact: 
14. The Court finds that [Yamashita]'s plumbing job
at Halawa will provide him with training and a skillset that
will allow him to become gainfully employed outside ofprison. 
In Pulgados we held: "[A] sentencing court must impose 
CVC fees upon the satisfaction of two conditions: (1) that the 
defendant has been convicted of a criminal offense, including a conviction upon a plea; and (2) a determination that the defendant is or will be able to pay the CVC fee." 2020 WL 6375183, at *7 (underscoring added). We concluded that the record "was insufficient to demonstrate that [the defendant] would not remain indigent, and unable to pay the CVC fees." Id. 
By contrast, in this case the circuit court's unchal-
lenged findings of fact established that: Yamashita voluntarily applied for his plumbing job at Halawa because he wanted to work; the plumbing job will provide him with training and a skillset that will allow him to become gainfully employed outside of prison; he was in good health and faced no kind of medical issue that would prevent him from working; and he intended to work full-time once released from prison or placed on parole to support his two daughters and pay his court-ordered restitution, 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
fines, and fees. The circuit court's imposition of CVC fees on 
Yamashita is supported by the unchallenged findings of fact and reflect an application of the correct rule of law. The circuit court did not err by concluding that Yamashita will be able to pay the CVC fees. 
B. The DDR Assessment 
The DDR assessment is imposed under HRS § 706-650 
(Supp. 2018). The statute provides, in relevant part: 
§706-650 Drug demand reduction assessments; special
fund.  (1) In addition to any disposition authorized by
chapter 706 or 853, any person who is: 
(a) Convicted of an offense under part IV of chapter
712, except sections 712-1250.5 and 712-1257; 
. . . . 
shall be ordered to pay a monetary assessment undersubsection (2), except as provided under subsection (5). 
(2) Monetary assessments for individuals subject to
subsection (1) shall not exceed the following: 
. . . . 
(c) $1,000 when the offense is a class C felony; 
. . . . 
Notwithstanding sections 706-640 and 706-641 and any otherlaw to the contrary, the assessments provided by thissection shall be in addition to and not in lieu of, andshall not be used to offset or reduce, any fine authorizedor required by law and shall be paid pursuant to section706-651.[
4] 
(3) There is established a special fund to be known as
the "drug demand reduction assessments special fund" to beadministered by the department of health. The disbursement of money from the drug demand reduction assessments specialfund shall be used to supplement substance abuse treatmentand other substance abuse demand reduction programs. 
(4) All monetary assessments paid and interest
accrued on funds collected pursuant to this section shall bedeposited into the drug demand reduction assessments specialfund. 
(5) . . . Upon a showing by the person that the
person lacks the financial ability to pay all or part of the 
4 See note 3. 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
monetary assessment, the court may waive or reduce the
amount of the monetary assessment. 
(Underscoring added.) 
In 2CPC-18-0000215, Yamashita was convicted of 
Promoting a Dangerous Drug in the Third Degree in violation of 
HRS § 712-1243(1) (2014), a class C felony. The plain language of HRS § 706-650(5) gave the circuit court the discretion, upon a showing that Yamashita lacked the financial ability to pay the DDR assessment, to "waive or reduce the amount" of the DDR assessment. See State v. Kahawai, 103 Hawai# i 462, 465, 83 P.3d 
725, 728 (2004) (noting that use of the term "may" in a statute denotes discretion). 
HRS § 706-651 (Supp. 2018) establishes the 
following priority of payments: 
When a defendant is ordered to make payments pursuant to
chapters 351, 706, 846F, and 853, or as otherwise providedby law, payments shall be made in the following order ofpriority: 
(1) Restitution; 
(2) Crime victims compensation [CVC] fee; (3) Probation services fee; (4) Human trafficking victim services fee; (5) Other fees, including but not limited to internet
crimes against children fee and drug demand reduction
assessment [DDR] fee; 
(6) DNA analysis monetary assessment; and 
(7) Fines. 
(Underscoring added.) Although Yamashita lacked the financial 
ability to pay the DDR assessment while incarcerated, the circuit court found that he will be able to pay the CVC fees after his release, and the DDR assessment is not payable until after the CVC fees are paid. The circuit court did not abuse its discre-tion when it did not waive Yamashita's DDR assessment, but reduced it from $1,000 to $100.

discretion, citing State v. Hussein, 122 Hawai #i 495, 229 P.3d 313 (2010) for
(continued...) 
9  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2. Constitutionality 
Yamashita argues that the CVC fees and DDR assessment 
are taxes imposed pursuant to an unconstitutional delegation of 
the legislature's power of taxation. Recently, in Adcock
, we 
held that the CVC fee is a fine, not a tax, because it is a penalty imposed after a criminal conviction, it is to be paid into a special fund in the state treasury that does not reimburse payments related to the defendant's prosecution, and it makes the severity of the crime a criterion to be considered when the court orders the payment. 148 
Hawai# i at 320-21, 473 P.3d at 781-82. 
The same analysis applies to the DDR assessment, which we hold is a permissible fine, not an unconstitutional tax. 
CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons: 
(1) the "Order of 
Resentencing; Revocation of Probation; Notice of Entry" entered in 2CPC-17-0000133 on May 31, 2019; (2) the "Judgment; Conviction 
and Sentence; Notice of Entry" entered in 2CPC-17-0000905, 
2CPC-17-0000986, 2CPC-18-0000215, 2CPC-18-0000321, 2CPC-18-0000632, 2CPC-18-0000792, and 2CPC-18-0000828 on May 31, 2019; and (3) the "Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law; Order 
Granting in Part and Denying in Part Defendant's Motion to Reconsider Sentence" entered in all eight cases on January 15, 2020, are affirmed. 
5 (...continued)
the proposition that "[t]here should be evidence in the record that discretion
was in fact exercised and the basis of that exercise of discretion should be set forth." Id. at 506 n.16, 229 P.3d at 324 n.16. Hussein established the 
prospective rule that "circuit courts must state on the record at the time ofsentencing the reasons for imposing a consecutive sentence" under HRS §§ 706-668.5(2) and 706-606. Id. at 510, 229 P.3d at 328 (underscoring added).
Hussein does not apply to a circuit court's discretionary decision to waive orreduce the DDR assessment under HRS § 706-650(5). Moreover, the circuitcourt's unchallenged findings of fact about Yamashita's employment prospectsafter his release from prison provide ample explanation for the circuitcourt's decision to reduce, rather than waive, the DDR assessment.
