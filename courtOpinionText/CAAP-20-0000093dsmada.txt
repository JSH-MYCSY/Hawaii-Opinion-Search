NO. CAAP-20-0000093 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
EDWARD QUIRING, Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellant, v.
THE ASSOCIATION OF APARTMENT OWNERS OF PAPAKEA,
Defendant/Counterclaim-Plaintiff/Appellee,
and, JOHN DOES 1-100, JANE DOES 1-100, DOE PARTNERSHIPS 1-100,
AND DOE CORPORATIONS 1-100, Defendants 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 2CC181000217(1)) 
ORDER GRANTING MAY 18, 2020 MOTION TO DISMISS APPELLATE COURT
CASE NUMBER CAAP-20-0000093 FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Upon review of (1) Defendant/Counterclaim-Plaintiff/ 
Appellee Association of Apartment Owners of Papakea's (Papakea) 
May 18, 2020 motion to dismiss appellate court case number CAAP
-
20-0000093 for lack of appellate jurisdiction, (2) the May 26, 2020 memorandum in opposition to Papakea's May 18, 2020 motion by 
Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellant Edward Quiring 
(Quiring), and (3) the record, it appears that we lack appellate 
jurisdiction over Quiring's appeal from the January 30, 2020 
order granting Papakea's motion to compel discovery, because the 
circuit court has not yet adjudicated and entered final judgment 
on the parties' multiple causes of action in Civil No. 18-1-
0217(1). 
"An appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders 
have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to 
HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright
, 76 
Hawai# i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). "Thus, based on 
Jenkins
 and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it 
resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat
, 119 
Hawai# i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008); 
Bailey v. 
DuVauchelle
, 135 Hawai# i 482, 489, 353 P.3d 1024, 1031 (2015). 
Consequently, "[a]n appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is 
filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." 
Jenkins
, 76 
Hawai# i at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote omitted). On April 2, 
2020, the circuit court clerk filed the record on appeal for 
appellate court case number CAAP-20-0000093, which does not 
include a final judgment. 
Although exceptions to the final judgment requirement 
exist under the doctrine in 
Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848) 
(the Forgay doctrine), the collateral order doctrine, and HRS ยง 641-1(b) (2016), the January 30, 2020 order does not satisfy 
the requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine, the 
collateral order doctrine, or HRS ยง 641-1(b). See Ciesla v. 
Reddish
, 78 Hawai# i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995); 
Abrams v. 
Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright
, 88 Hawai# i 319, 322, 966 P.2d 
631, 634 (1998); 
Greer v. Baker
, 137 Hawai# i 249, 253, 369 P.3d 
832, 836 (2016). 
We note that, when analyzing whether an order 
compelling discovery was appealable under the collateral order 
doctrine, the Supreme Court of Hawai# i has "h[e]ld that there is 
no appellate jurisdiction over interlocutory appeals from discovery orders, [even] despite a claim of attorney-client 
privilege." 
Abrams
, 88 Hawai# i at 323, 966 P.2d at 635 (footnote 
omitted); 
Brende v. Hara
, 113 Hawai# i 424, 429, 153 P.3d 1109, 
1114 (2007) ("Discovery orders are not immediately 
appealable[.]"). "In the exceptional case, parties are not 
without a remedy. A petition for writ of mandamus is available 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
for extraordinary situations." Abrams , 88 Hawai# i at 323, 966 
P.2d at 635 (footnote omitted). 
Even to the extent that one views the January 30, 2020 
order as a "sanction order" because it awards attorneys' fees and 
costs in favor of Papakea and against Quiring pursuant to HRCP 
Rule 37(a)(4)(A), the Supreme Court of Hawai# i has held that an 
interlocutory sanction order against a party is appealable under the "collateral order doctrine" only if "the order directed 
payment of the assessed sum and was immediately enforceable 
through contempt proceedings." 
Harada v. Ellis
, 60 Haw. 467, 
480, 591 P.2d 1060, 1070 (1979). Although the January 30, 2020 order imposes an award of attorneys' fees and costs against 
Quiring in a specific amount, it does not appear to be 
immediately enforceable through contempt proceedings. Therefore, 
the January 30, 2020 order does not qualify as appealable 
sanction order under the collateral order doctrine and the 
holding in Harada. Absent an appealable final judgment, 
Quiring's appeal from the January 30, 2020 order is premature, 
and we lack appellate jurisdiction. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Papakea's May 18, 
2020 motion to dismiss Quiring's appeal from the January 30, 2020 
order is granted, and CAAP-20-0000093 is dismissed for lack of 
appellate jurisdiction.
