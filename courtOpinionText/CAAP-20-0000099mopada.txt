Circuit (Family Court).2 Appellee-State of Hawai# i Department of 
Human Services (DHS) recommended adoption of the minor male child (Child

petition. 
On appeal, Grandmother contends the Family Court erred: 
(1) by exceeding its subject matter jurisdiction in finding that 
the DHS acted reasonably in failing to place Child with Grandmother in 2016 (Findings of Fact (FOF) 163 and Conclusions 
of Law (COL) 15, 17, 31);  (2) by allowing improper ex parte 
communications in the separate FC-S child welfare case (FC-S case) without notice to Grandmother; (3) by applying judicial 
estoppel to Grandmother's objections to the testimony and 
recommendations of the Family Court's custody evaluator, Dr. Robert Simon (Dr. Simon) (COLs 3, 4, 5); (4) by accepting Dr. 43

Grandmother provides argument as to FOF163, but none as to COLs 15, 17, and 31 on subject matter jurisdictiongrounds. We do not address Grandmother's challenge to COLs 15, 17, and 31 onthis ground.

Simon's findings while rejecting the findings of Grandmother's 
experts -- Drs. Jonathan Gould (Dr. Gould), Kim Norman (Dr. 
Norman), and Mark Burdick (Dr. Burdick) (FOF 256, COL 7); (5) by 
denying Grandmother's petition despite its findings and 
conclusions that Grandmother satisfied the HRS ยง 578-8 adoption requirements (COLs 13, 14, 15, 24, and 25); (6) by concluding that the DHS reasonably withheld consent to Grandmother's petition despite evidence that HRS ยง 578-8 (2018) was satisfied (COL 15); (7) in its analysis of the mandatory HRS ยง 578-8 factors and the "discretionary" HRS ยง 571-46 (2018) best interest factors and challenging "contradict[ory]" FOFs and COLs (COLs 3, 4, 10, 19, 26(b)(9), 27, 28, and 33); and (8) by entering erroneous, inconsistent, and unsupported findings and conclusions (FOFs 33, 256, COLs 10 and 26(b)(9)), and by omitting findings and conclusions establishing that Grandmother's adoption of Child would be in Child's best interests. 
We hold that the Family Court's ruling, that 
Grandmother was judicially estopped from challenging Dr. Simon's methodology, was harmless error where it was a ruling in the alternative, and where Grandmother had the opportunity to cross-examine and challenge Dr. Simon at trial. We conclude that the Family Court did not abuse its discretion in granting Caregivers' adoption petition. We strike FOF 163, without prejudice, as an unnecessary and irrelevant finding in these adoption proceedings, and affirm in all other respects. 
I. BACKGROUND 
Child was born November 5, 2013, at Kona Community 
Hospital to biological mother ST (Mother), and biological father 
LE (Father). Mother is the biological daughter of Grandmother 
and MT (Grandfather).  Mother had emotional and substance abuse 
issues with alcoholism, drug addiction and mental health problems 
plaguing her throughout most of her adult life. On March 23, 
3    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
2016, Mother was arrested for a felony abuse charge related to 
Grandmother. Grandmother was contacted by the Kona Police 
Department to come and pick up Child, who was with Mother at the 
time of her arrest, and Grandmother did so, bringing Child back to Grandmother's home. The following day, Grandmother reported to the DHS that she had Child. Child was temporarily placed with Grandmother, but she purportedly asked Child Welfare Services (CWS) to move him, less than three days after placement, fearing 
that Mother would make good on threats of violence she had made 
on Grandmother and Child. While this reason is disputed by the DHS and Caregivers, the parties agreed that Grandmother requested the removal, and that Grandmother did not ask for Child to be returned to her care until sometime around Mother's death. On March 31, 2016, the DHS filed a Petition for Temporary Foster Custody of Child in the Family Court of the Third Circuit, in FC-S No. 16-0013K. 
As General Licensed Resource Caregivers, Caregivers 
agreed to take Child. After a brief reunification with Mother, Child was again placed with Caregivers in August 2016, after Mother abandoned Child at a homeless shelter. Sometime around September 13, 2016, prior to Mother's death, Grandmother contacted a CWS social worker, Kerry Perez (Social Worker), about 
having full custody of Child, but Social Worker told Grandmother 
that full custody of Child "was not possible at that time because [Mother] still had rights to a possible reunification with [Child] depending on her progress and compliance with the Interim Service Plan." On September 15, 2016, Mother died from injuries she sustained in an automobile collision. In September and October 2016, after Mother's death, Grandmother took necessary steps to be considered for Child's placement with her; Grandmother submitted a Foster Home Application for Child, completed the Relative Response Form, and completed all of the 
4   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
requirements of the H.A.N.A.I. Resource Caregiving Training for 
Children in the Foster Care System. 
On December 6, 2016, Grandmother filed a motion to 
intervene in the FC-S case,5 after learning that Caregivers asked 
the Family Court6 for permission to take Child on a family 
vacation to the mainland, which would include a visit with Grandfather, Grandmother's ex-husband. On December 29, 2016, the Family Court denied Grandmother's motion to intervene, and Child was permitted to join Caregivers' family trip, including the visit with Grandfather and Grandfather's extended family. 
On March 2, 2018, the DHS filed its Permanent Plan 
Report in the FC-S case, which recommended permanent placement of Child with Caregivers upon the termination of parental rights. 
On March 29, 2018, Grandmother filed her petition to 
adopt Child in Grandmother's adoption case FC-A No. 18-1-005K. 
On May 11, 2018, the Family Court in the FC-S case 
terminated the parental rights of Mother and Father, and appointed the DHS permanent custodian of Child. At that time, Grandmother was still not a party to the FC-S case. 
On May 14, 2018, the DHS filed its objections to 
Grandmother's petition in the adoption case, FC-A No. 18-1-005K. 
On August 13, 2018, the DHS filed a petition on behalf 
of Caregivers, in FC-A No. 18-1-019K, for Caregivers to adopt Child. 
The consolidated trial on the competing adoption 
petitions was held for approximately twelve days from May through October of 2019 on the following dates: May 3, May 29, May 30, May 31, June 26, June 28, August 9, August 12, August 14, September 25, September 30, and October 7, 2019. Child was

nearly six years old at the time of the 2019 trial, and had 
resided continuously with Caregivers and their children since August 2016. 
During the ongoing trial of the contested adoption 
cases in FC-A No. 18-1-005K and FC-A No. 18-1-019K, on June 12, 2019, the DHS filed an ex parte motion on behalf of Caregivers, to request permission from the Family Court in the FC-S case to travel with Child to the mainland and visit Caregivers' families, Grandfather's family, and Child's biological cousins and maternal aunt who flew in from France for the visit. The Family Court granted the ex parte motion and entered an order approving travel on condition that the DHS notify Grandmother of the travel plans and arrange make-up visitation with her. On June 24, 2019, Grandmother filed an ex parte motion to shorten time on Grandmother's second motion to intervene in the FC-S case, and to vacate the Family Court's order granting the DHS's travel request. Grandmother sought to block Child's travel alleging that it would re-traumatize Child to be away from Grandmother. 
The Family Court denied Grandmother's motion to vacate 
Child's travel, but on August 28, 2019, granted Grandmother's second motion to intervene in the FC-S case. 
The Family Court filed its Decision and Order on 
December 30, 2019, awarding adoption of Child to Caregivers. The Adoption Decree in favor of Caregivers was filed on February 27, 2020. Grandmother timely appealed.
7 
7 Self-represented Caregivers filed an Answering Brief that does not
comply with HRAP Rule 28(c). In substance, Caregivers "adopt-in-full" the
DHS's Answering Brief, and the remainder reads more like a letter to thecourt. However, the Hawai #i Supreme Court has stated that, to promote access
to justice, pleadings prepared by self-represented litigants should beinterpreted liberally; and that self-represented litigants should not beautomatically foreclosed from appellate review because they fail to complywith court rules. See Erum v. Llego, 147 Hawai #i 368, 380-81, 465 P.3d 815,
827-28 (2020). 
Accordingly, we may consider the Caregivers' filing.

II. DISCUSSION8 
A. Claim of "ex parte" communication in FC-S case. 
Grandmother's contention that the Family Court violated 
her due process rights by allowing ex parte communication in the 
FC-S case without notice to Grandmother, is without merit. Grandmother was not allowed to intervene in the FC-S case until 2019. Grandmother's arguments points to two specific instances of ex parte communication in the FC-S case in 2018, prior to Grandmother's intervention: (1) a letter from the Caregivers to the Family Court presented at a September 24, 2018 hearing in the FC-S case; and (2) "safety concerns" about Grandmother that the Guardian ad Litem, Madeline Reed (GAL), brought up at a October 
26, 2018 hearing in the adoption case, that had been raised in 
the FC-S case. 
Grandmother claims the Caregivers' letter contained 
"negative and substantive ex parte communications" from Social Worker, the GAL, and Caregivers. However, it appears that the Family Court did not receive the letter into evidence at the hearing, and at a subsequent hearing, clarified that the letter was "not actually provided to the Court," and the Family Court had not considered the letter.

8 We have reordered and consolidated Grandmother's points of error
for clarity. 
9 The transcript of the September 24, 2018 FC-S hearing reflects the
Family Court did not receive the letter into evidence: 
[SOCIAL WORKER]: Um, Your Honor, I just wanted to
make sure that you took note of the -- the resource parents
provided a letter that is an attachment on that report, um,
that they really would like to keep confidential which iswhy I've submitted it in the FC-S case and not in theadoption case, um. 
THE COURT: Okay. 
. . . . 
[SOCIAL WORKER]: 
I just, um, you know, the -- the
resource parents have to continue to, um, work with

where in the record the letter can be found, as required by HRAP 
Rule 28(b)(3). See Taniguchi v. Ass'n of Apartment Owners of 
King Manor, Inc., 114 Hawai# i 37, 53, 155 P.3d 1138, 1154 (2007) 
(waiving argument not supported by reference to the record) 
(...continued)
[Grandmother] who has, you know, there's been some, um,
negativity, and they wanna be able to share openly with theCourt in the best interest of [Child] without creating moreanimosity, um, you know. 
THE COURT: Sir, I understand. I understand that, um,
that you don't wanna, um, burn bridges when you don't haveto. The Court has not received this into evidence yet. 
(Emphases added). At a subsequent hearing approximately a month later in theadoption case, the Family Court responded to Grandmother's request fordocument production, and specifically ordered the letter be produced toGrandmother as follows: 
[GRANDMOTHER'S COUNSEL]: Um, I think โ- I think what
we would like to do with respect to the FC-S file . . . .there appears to be a letter to the Court from [Caregivers].Uh, the date of that letter is not identified. We have not seen that. We don't know its contents. 
It is our view that that letter โ- that the other 
documents the Court's identified as being confidential Ithink are protected under the court records rules and that'sfine. Um, it's that one letter that is the subject of ourlimited objections and we cited some authorities on that. 
. . . . 
THE COURT: -โ but, um, 
I've already determined that
that letter is something that should be produced. . . . . 
THE COURT: โ- the Court did wanna make a note that 
with respect to that letter it was not actually provided to
the Court
. Um, it was, um, I believe it was brought to
court, um, but then I said that if it wasn't gonna be givento all of the parties then it wasn't something, um, that theCourt could actually review. 
So I think it's part of the record because it existed
and so it got put in the file, but I wanted to note on therecord it's not something โ- I mean I saw it because it's โ-
it's in there now, but it's not something that hadpreviously been considered by the Court. Um, so I would notagree, um, with the DHS's request that it not be produced'cause I think it's relevant. 
(Emphases added). The Family Court indicated that it did not consider theletter. 
8   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
(citations omitted). Grandmother's contentions about the letter 
are insufficient. Nor is there any indication that the Family Court actually considered the letter. Grandmother's contention of error is without merit. 
Grandmother's second claim is that the GAL improperly 
brought up "safety concerns" about Grandmother from the FC-S case, at a October 26, 2018 hearing in this case. Grandmother argues that the Family Court was privy to additional informationpurportedly presented at the FC-S hearing, and the Family Court improperly considered such information when addressing future off-island travel. Our review of the pertinent transcript reveals that no objection was raised during the hearing,  and 
10 
10 The only discernible response we can find as to Grandmother's
second claim regarding the GAL's mention of "safety concerns" was made at the
October 26, 2018 hearing, as follows: 
THE COURT: Okay? Anything else? Were there other 
issues between โ-
[GAL]: Yeah, just one matter for clarification. 
So in the FC-S case, um, I believe there is already an
order stating that no one is to remove the child from the
Island of Hawai #i without court permission. Um, there has
been some concern that even after being instructed otherwisethat [Grandmother] had perhaps taken [Child] off island. 
. . . . 
[GRANDMOTHER'S COUNSEL]: 
It's the first I've heard of 
it. Uh, I've -โ I've heard absolutely no hint or suggestionfrom any party that [Grandmother] has removed [Child] fromthe island. Um, uh, I saw him this morning, uh, so I knowthat he is on the island today, um, but, uh โ-
[GAL]: Yeah. Today's not the issue. 
. . . . 
THE COURT: 
Not to interrupt you but I don't think it
was โ- it was, uh, like yesterday or last week that there'sbeen, uh, an issue with, uh, with the child being removedfrom the Big Island but. 
. . . . 
THE COURT: 
I'm talking about โ- I'm talking about the

this issue is waived. See HRAP Rule 28(b)(3); State v. Moses, 
102 Hawai# i 449, 456, 77 P.3d 940, 947 (2003) ("As a general 
rule, if a party does not raise an argument at trial, that 
argument will be deemed to have been waived on appeal . . . ."); State v. Hoglund, 71 Haw. 147, 150, 785 P.2d 1311, 1313 (1990) ("Generally, the failure to properly raise an issue at the trial level precludes a party from raising that issue on appeal."). 
As to Grandmother's argument that Grandmother's due 
process rights were violated by the "ex parte" communication, Grandmother has not indicated whether and how her due process challenge was preserved below, and it is waived. See Moses, 102 
Hawai#i at 456, 77 P.3d at 947; Hoglund, 71 Haw. at 150, 785 P.2d 
at 1313. 
B. FOF 163 was unnecessary and irrelevant. 
Grandmother contends that the Family Court "exceed[ed] 
its subject matter jurisdiction by finding that [the] DHS acted reasonably in failing to place" Child with Grandmother in 2016, 
(...continued)
โ- off the islands. 
[GRANDMOTHER'S COUNSEL]: Uh, to the โ- to my best
knowledge that has never happened by [Grandmother]. It โ-
it has happened that he's been taken to the mainland, um,with the โ-
THE COURT: With permission โ-
[GRANDMOTHER'S COUNSEL]: โ- State's approval. THE COURT: โ- of the Court. Right. [GAL]: Yeah. THE COURT: But I mean before you make any more
representations on the record you might wanna review the
documents just to see, uh, what the surrounding, uh,understanding or what it was. 
But I โ- I'm not saying that it happened. I'm just
saying, uh, that the Court will go ahead and order that noone shall take the minor off the Island of Hawai #i without 
permission of the Court. . . . 
(Emphasis added). 
10   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
and argues the Family Court "overreached" its jurisdiction in FOF
163. Grandmother argues that the Family Court did not have 
subject matter jurisdiction to conclude that the DHS's 2016 placement decisions were reasonable, "essentially deciding the main issue raised by [Grandmother] in a separate lawsuit filed against [the DHS]."  Grandmother's challenge to FOF 163 has 
merit but on grounds different from what Grandmother argues. 
1211 
"Subject matter jurisdiction is concerned with whether 
the court has the power to hear a case." Int'l Bhd. of Painters 
& Allied Trades, Local Union 1944 v. Befitel, 104 Hawai# i 275, 
281, 88 P.3d 647, 653 (2004) (citation omitted). Grandmother claims that FOF 163 was erroneous because it was "beyond the court's reach" and jurisdiction and was an "attempt to hamstring [Grandmother's] separate lawsuit against DHS." The Family Court 
had subject matter jurisdiction to hear and decide the competing 
adoption petitions in this case. 
While we reject Grandmother's 
jurisdictional argument as without merit, we nevertheless agree that FOF 163 was irrelevant to the issues in these adoption proceedings. 
11 FOF 163 provides: "For these and all other reasons supported by
the record herein the court finds that [the] DHS did not act unreasonably in
failing to place [Child] with [Grandmother] after the initial placement of[Child] with [Grandmother] in March of 2016." 
12 We take judicial notice of the records and files in Grandmother's
separate lawsuit filed on March 15, 2019, in the Circuit Court of the ThirdCircuit ( Circuit Court ), Civil No. 3CC19100072K. See Hawai #i Rules of 
Evidence Rule 201; see also State v. Kwong, 149 Hawai #i 106, 116-17, 482 P.3d
1067, 1077-78 (citing Eli v. State, 63 Haw. 474, 478, 630 P.2d 113, 116 (1981)(where the equity of a situation dictates, an appellate court may use itsdiscretion to take judicial notice of court files that are not part of the
record of appeal)). Grandmother's Circuit Court complaint alleges, inter 
alia, negligence against the State, negligent infliction of emotional
distress, and multiple violations of the Hawai #i State Constitution, against
defendants State of 
Hawai #i, the DHS Social Worker, the DHS Supervisor, the
DHS Unit Supervisor, the Caregivers, and "Doe Defendants." The Caregivers
were subsequently dismissed from the lawsuit on September 24, 2019 bystipulation. The DHS Social Worker, DHS Supervisor, and DHS Unit Supervisorwere also dismissed from the lawsuit on January 3, 2020 after the CircuitCourt granted their motion to dismiss. On January 13, 2020, the State filed aMotion for Summary Judgment as to the Third Circuit Court's lack of subjectmatter jurisdiction based on judicial findings and rulings from the FamilyCourt; this motion was stayed as of April 21, 2020, pending the outcome ofthis appeal. 
11   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
FOF 163's finding that the "DHS did not act 
unreasonably" in its 2016 placement decision (to place Child with 
Caregivers) was unnecessary and irrelevant to decide the competing adoptions filed in 2018. The application of the HRS ยง 578-8 adoption criteria and the best interests factors in HRS ยง 571-46 to these competing adoption petitions does not require or entail a judicial finding or determination of the reasonableness of the DHS's placement decisions two years earlier. Because FOF 163 was unnecessarily included and outside the scope of the current dispute in the adoption case, and given pending litigation between the parties, we conclude it is appropriate to strike FOF 163. See Chase v. Shasta Lake Union School Dist., 259 
Cal. App. 2d 612, 616 (1968) ("Appellate courts . . . may strike unnecessary findings[.]") (citation omitted). Accordingly, we strike FOF 163. See id. 
C. No separate and immediate hearing required
for consent to adoption under HRS ยง 578-2(c)(1)(H). 
Grandmother challenges COL 15
13 and contends that the 
13 COL 15 states: 
15. DHS, the agency having legal custody of [Child],
reasonably withheld its consent to [Grandmother's]adoption of [Child] for the following reasons: 
a. [Grandmother] had custody of [Child] in March,
2016 as a foster parent and it was [Grandmother]who contacted DHS and asked them to remove [Child] because she could not find theappropriate child care. It was not until after [Mother] passed away that [Grandmother] soughtto regain custody of [Child] and filed a secondapplication for foster custody of [Child]; 
b. [Grandmother] was not credible in asserting thatshe will maintain connections between [Child]and his other relatives; 
c. [Grandfather] supported the adoption of [Child]by the [Caregivers] and expressed reasonablefears that [Grandmother] will cut-off contactbetween [Child] and his family if [Grandmother]

Family Court erred by concluding that the DHS reasonably withheld 
consent to Grandmother's petition "despite evidence that HRS ยง 578-8 was satisfied" and without a "separate inquiry" into the withholding of consent as required by Matter of Adoption of H.A., 143 Hawai# i 64, 422 P.3d 642 (App. 2017). Grandmother claims 
that after the DHS filed its May 14, 2018 written objections to Grandmother's March 29, 2018 petition, the Family Court should have held a "hearing immediately" on this issue, rather than conducting the inquiry at trial one year later. Grandmother argues that "[h]ad actual and timely inquiry been made into [the DHS's] objections as required per 578-2(c)(1)(H)," the Family Court would have "found unreasonable withholding of consent." 
However, Grandmother does not point to, and the record 
does not reflect, that Grandmother raised these challenges below, i.e., that a separate hearing on the withholding of consent was immediately required. 
This argument is waived. See Moses, 102

D. Application of judicial estoppel was
harmless error. 
Grandmother contends that the Family Court erred by 
applying judicial estoppel, in COLs 3, 4, and 5, to Grandmother's 
objections to the findings and recommendations of the custody evaluator, Dr. Simon. Grandmother argues that the Family Court misconstrued the parties' stipulation, drafted by Grandmother's counsel, from an agreement for Dr. Simon to do an evaluation, to a "non-existing agreement not to challenge whatever methodology Dr. Simon chose to undertake." 
Grandmother also claims that the 
Family Court "unfairly denied" Grandmother's discovery motions for Hawai# i Family Court Rules (HFCR) Rule 35  examinations by 
the expert witnesses because "[u]nder HFCR 26(b), broad discovery, including Rule 35 examinations, is generally allowed."  While the application of judicial estoppel was

to submit to physical or mental examinations, as follows:

"[T]he family court's COLs are reviewed on appeal de

are "not binding upon an appellate court and are freely reviewable for their correctness." In re Doe, 95 Hawai# i 183, 
190, 20 P.3d 619, 623 (2001) (italics in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). COLs 3, 4, and 5 state: 
3. Pursuant to the doctrine of judicial estoppel,
a party will not be permitted to maintain inconsistent
positions or to take a position in regard to a matterwhich is directly contrary to, or inconsistent with, onepreviously assumed by him, at least where he has, or ischargeable with, full knowledge of the facts, and anotherwill be prejudiced by his action. Judicial estoppelpartakes of positive rules of procedure based on manifestjustice and, to a greater or lesser degree, on considerationsof the orderliness, regularity, and expedition of litigation.This doctrine prevents parties from playing fast and loosewith the court or blowing hot and cold during the course of
litigation. Roxas v. Marcos , 89 Haw. 91, 99, 969 P.2d 1209,
1217 (Haw. 1998). 
4. Upon the failure of [Grandmother] to have Dr.
Norman appointed as the custody evaluator, the parties
discussed alternative custody evaluators and agreed uponDr. Simon. [Grandmother] drafted, agreed to and acceptedthe CE Stipulation and Order which expressly sets forth thatDr. Simon would conduct a thorough and comprehensive custodyand visitation evaluation, as he sees fit at his solediscretion - including determining which collaterals tocontact. In reliance upon the CE Stipulation and Order, thecourt then proceeded to move forward with the litigation withthe understanding that Dr. Simon, as a neutral, would beassisting the court and the parties in reaching a fairresolution of their competing petitions. Prior to the commencement of trial, Dr. Simon concluded in favor of the[Caregivers] adopting [Child] over [Grandmother].[Grandmother] immediately rejected Dr. Simon's report andconclusions and sought, through her own testimony and that of

It is not ground for objection that the information sought will beinadmissible at the trial if the discovery appearsreasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissibleevidence.

her experts, to discount every aspect of Dr. Simon's Report,
opinions and methodology. 
5. As an alternative and independent basis for its
rulings herein the court finds that [Grandmother] isjudicially estopped from contesting Dr. Simon's methodology,having previously solicited and obtained the opposing partiesand the court's agreements to allow Dr. Simon to conduct hisevaluation at his sole discretion. 
(Emphasis added) (italics in original). COL 3 states the law of 
judicial estoppel. COL 4 sets forth pertinent procedural history and contains findings of fact, rather than conclusions of law, which have not been shown to be clearly erroneous. See Kilauea 
Neighborhood Ass'n v. Land Use Comm'n of the State of Hawaii, 7 Haw. App. 227, 229, 751 P.2d 1031, 1034 (1988) (accuracy of label affixed by agency, as a finding of fact or conclusion of law, is freely reviewable by the appellate courts). As to COL 5, however, where the Family Court applied judicial estoppel against Grandmother's challenge to Dr. Simon's methodology because of the parties' prior agreement, we conclude the Family Court erred. 
Grandmother asserts that "[u]nder the Stipulation, made 
pursuant to HRS ยง 571-45 and ยง 571-46(4), [Grandmother] was free to cross-examine Dr. Simon in all respects as HRS ยง 571-46(a) expressly provides." In the November 21, 2019 Stipulation and Order for Appointment of Custody/Visitation Evaluator (Stipulation), entered into pursuant to HRS ยงยง 571-45 (2018) and 
571-46(a)(4) (2018),
16 the parties agreed to the appointment of 
Dr. Simon as the neutral custody evaluator who would prepare a 
report for the Family Court. HRS ยง 571-46(a)(4) provides the parties with the right to object to the custody evaluator's 
16 HRS ยง 571-45 provides for, inter alia , social studies, assessments
and investigation reports to be completed for the courts prior to dispositions
and decisions regarding disputed custody or support issues. 
The Stipulation incorrectly cited HRS ยง 571-46(4); the correct
statute is HRS ยง 571-46(a)(4). 
16    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
report and a right to cross-examine the author of the report.17 
Consistent with HRS ยง 571-46(a)(4), there was no language in the 
Stipulation that prohibited any party from challenging Dr. Simon's report. Thus, this portion of COL 5, where the Family Court applied judicial estoppel to Grandmother's challenge to Dr.Simon's methodology, was wrong.  
We nevertheless conclude that the Family Court's 
erroneous application of judicial estoppel was harmless because the Family Court stated that estoppel was applied as "an alternative and independent basis for its rulings herein . . . ." COL 5 (emphasis added); see HFCR Rule 61.
18 This error did not 
affect Grandmother's substantial statutory right to challenge Dr. Simon at trial, where the record reflects that Grandmother was afforded the opportunity to question and examine Dr. Simon at trial, via depositions, which were made a part of the trial 
17 HRS ยง 571-46(a)(4) provides: 
Whenever good cause appears therefor, the court may require
an investigation and report concerning the care, welfare,and custody of any minor child of the parties. When so directed by the court, investigators or professionalpersonnel attached to or assisting the court, hereinafterreferred to as child custody evaluators, shall makeinvestigations and reports that shall be made available toall interested parties and counsel before hearing, and thereports may be received in evidence if no objection is madeand, if objection is made, may be received in evidence;provided the person or persons responsible for the reportare available for cross-examination as to any matter thathas been investigated. . . .

record by agreement, and Dr. Simon's trial testimony by video 
conference. See id.
Grandmother also argues that the Family Court "unfairly 
denied" her HFCR Rule 35 motions for examination, where Dr. Simon's final report was not submitted until April 30, 2019, three days before trial.
19 See FOF 250. We conclude that the 
Family Court did not abuse its discretion in denying these requests. 
We review a trial court's rulings on discovery matters 
for abuse of discretion. Fisher v. Grove Farm Co., Inc., 123 
Hawai#i 82, 94, 230 P.3d 382, 394 (App. 2009) (citation omitted). 
The Family Court denied Grandmother's first Rule 35 motion for Dr. Norman to conduct an examination of Child without prejudice on October 1, 2018, because the Family Court wanted to wait for the custody evaluator's report. See FOFs 289, 290. This was not 
an abuse of discretion. On April 9, 2019, Grandmother moved the court for Rule 35 examinations, both for retroactive approval of examinations that Dr. Norman had improperly conducted of Child without court approval, and for prospective approval for future testing of Child by Dr. Burdick and Dr. Norman. See FOFs 301, 
302. The Family Court denied the motion for retroactive 
approval, and denied the request for additional testing of Child because the court did not want to delay the commencement of trial. See FOFs 291, 301, 302. The Family Court did not abuse 
its discretion in denying these requests. 
Grandmother claims the Family Court "unfairly denied" 
the Rule 35 motions because at trial, the Family Court "then discounted the testimony of Dr.'s [sic] Norman and Burdick, in part because examinations had not been done," citing FOFs 298-300, 309, and 314-317, 340 and 346. We have reviewed these 
19 Grandmother did not raise the denial of the Rule 35 discovery
motions in her point of error as required under HRAP Rule 28(b)(4). However,
we review her argument in the interest of addressing the merits of appealswhere possible. 
18   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
findings, which have not been challenged by Grandmother, and they 
do not reflect that the reason why the Family Court rejected the testimony of Dr. Norman and Dr. Burdick was "in part because examinations had not been done[.]" Unchallenged findings are binding on appeal. In re Doe, 99 Hawai# i 522, 538, 57 P.3d 447, 
463 (2002) (citation omitted). 
FOFs 298-300 recount the 
procedural facts surrounding the requests for examination. FOFs 309 and 314 refer to Dr. Norman's lack of meeting with Caregivers and lack of observation of Child in the Caregivers' home; and concludes that these deficiencies, inter alia, render Dr. Norman's opinions "factually flawed." The second motion for Rule 35 examination requested additional testing of Child; not to meet with Caregivers or to observe Child in Caregivers' home. In FOFs 315-317, the Family Court weighed and considered Dr. Norman's testimony, finding him not credible, and the fact that the Rule 35 examination for testing of Child "had not been done" was not a factor in its assessment. In FOF 340, the Family Court discounted Dr. Burdick's testimony because he did not meet with Caregivers, not because the additional testing of Child was not done. In FOF 346, the Family Court rejected Dr. Burdick's report due to its reliance on Dr. Norman's report and opinion. Grandmother's contentions are without merit. 
E. The Family Court did not err in accepting Dr.
Simon's opinions and rejecting the opinions ofGrandmother's experts. 
Grandmother contends that the Family Court erred in 
accepting Dr. Simon's opinions and rejecting the opinions of Drs. 
Gould, Norman, and Burdick. Grandmother argues the Family Court should not have discounted: 
(1) the reliability of Dr. Gould's 
report; (2) the Bracken Test performed by Dr. Norman; and (3) the reliability of Dr. Burdick's findings. Grandmother challenges, inter alia, Dr. Simon's methodology and analysis, as "poor," "patently unreliable," and "conclusory;" the lateness of Dr. Simon's report; and the report's lack of focus on the statutory 
19   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
criteria. We conclude the Family Court did not err or abuse its 
discretion. 
"The family court is given much leeway in its 
examination of the reports concerning a child's care, custody and welfare[.]" Fisher v. Fisher, 111 Hawai# i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 
360 (2006) (citing Doe, 95 Hawai# i at 190, 20 P.3d at 623). Its 
conclusions, if supported by the record and not clearly erroneous, must stand on appeal. Id."It is well-settled that 
an appellate court will not pass upon issues dependent upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight of evidence; this is the province of the trier of fact." Id.; see JM v. YM, No. CAAP-14-
0001178, 2016 WL 300900, at *3 (Haw. App. Jan. 25, 2016) (mem.) (holding that it was not clearly erroneous for the family court to have given less weight to an expert's testimony than to the testimony of the custody evaluator). 
Here, Grandmother's experts testified and presented 
their reports at trial. Dr. Simon also testified at trial, via deposition and live trial testimony. As factfinder, the Family Court heard all of the evidence, specifically evaluated and weighed each expert's testimony, and made credibility determinations which it explained in detailed FOFs/COLs. The Family Court's determinations of each expert's credibility, and the weight to be given to each expert's testimony, were well within its broad discretion and role as factfinder โ and thus, Grandmother's contentions are without merit. See Fisher, 111 
Hawai#i at 46, 137 P.3d at 360. 
F. The Family Court did not clearly err in denying
Grandmother's petition. 
Grandmother contends that the Family Court erred in 
denying her Petition because: (1) Grandmother satisfied the HRS 
ยง 578-8 adoption requirements; (2) the court erroneously analyzed the "mandatory HRS ยง 578-8 factors and the discretionary HRS ยง 571-46 best interest factors;" and (3) there were errors and 
20   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
omissions in the FOFs/COLs that Child's best interest was 
adoption by Grandmother. We reject Grandmother's contention that the Family Court erred in denying her Petition. 
"[W]hen a conclusion of law presents mixed questions of 
fact and law, we review it under the 'clearly erroneous' standard because the court's conclusions are dependent on the facts and circumstances of each individual case." JW v. RJ, 146 Hawai# i 
581, 585, 463 P.3d 1238, 1242 (App. 2020) (citing Estate of Klink ex rel. Klink v. State, 113 Hawai# i 332, 351, 152 P.3d 504, 523 
(2007)). 
Adoption proceedings are governed by HRS Chapter 578. 
In re H.A., 143 Hawai# i at 75, 422 P.3d at 653. "[N]o decree of 
adoption may be entered unless all of the HRS ยง 578-8(a) requirements have been satisfied." Id. at 78-79, 422 P.3d at 
656-57. HRS ยง 578-8(a),
20 sets forth four criteria that must be 
assessed in order for the Family Court to enter an adoption decree: (1) the child is adoptable; (2) the child is physically, mentally, and otherwise suitable for adoption by the petitioners; (3) the petitioners are fit and proper persons who are 
20 HRS ยง 578-8(a)(1)-(4) (2018) provides as follows: 
(a) No decree of adoption shall be entered unless a
hearing has been held at which the petitioner or
petitioners, and any legal parent married to a petitioner,and any subject of the adoption whose consent is required,have personally appeared before the court, unless expresslyexcused by the court. After considering the petition andany evidence as the petitioners and any other properlyinterested person may wish to present, the court may enter adecree of adoption if it is satisfied that: 
(1) The individual is adoptable under sections 578-1and 578-2; 
(2) The individual is physically, mentally, and
otherwise suitable for adoption by the petitioners; 
(3) The petitioners are fit and proper persons and
financially able to give the individual a proper home
and education, if the individual is a child; and 
(4) The adoption will be for the best interests of
the individual[.] 
21   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
financially able to give the child a proper home and education; 
and (4) the adoption is in the best interests of the child. A family court's "determination of what is or is not in a child's best interests is reviewed on appeal for clear error." Id. at 
75, 422 P.3d at 653 (citation omitted). 
Here, the Family Court addressed each of the four 
criteria, and determined it was in Child's best interests for the Caregivers' petition to be granted. Grandmother's arguments focus on Factor 3 (HRS ยง 578-8(a)(3)), where the Family Court found that the Caregivers are fit and proper adoptive parents and financially able to give Child a proper home and education (see COL 19); and Factor 4 (HRS ยง 578-8(a)(4)), where the Family Court found it was in Child's best interests to be adopted by the Caregivers. See COLs 20 and 26. It was not clearly erroneous of 
the Family Court to grant the Caregivers' petition after weighing the evidence and drawing conclusions as to each HRS ยง 578-8 factor. See id.; JW, 146 Hawai# i at 585, 463 P.3d at 1242. 
With regard to Factor 3, Grandmother argues that the 
Family Court did not adequately address the financial ability of Caregivers pursuant to HRS ยง 578-8(a)(3), which states: "The petitioners are fit and proper persons and financially able to give [child] a proper home and education. . . ." Grandmother challenges COLs 19 and 33,
21 that determined that Caregivers are 
"financially able" to give Child a proper home and education. Grandmother argues that no findings were made substantiating Caregivers' financial ability, other than a conclusory statement that the Caregivers are financially able to provide for Child. While there are findings that reference Caregivers' travel to 
21 COL 19 states: "The [Caregivers] are fit and proper adoptive
parents and financially able to give [Child] a proper home and education, as
required by HRS ยง 578-8(a)(3)." 
COL 33 states: "Based on the Court's FOF set forth above, the
court concludes that the four factors in HRS ยง 578-8(a) are satisfied by theadoption of [Child] by the [Caregivers]." 
22   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
California "at least once a year to visit their family and 
friends," (FOF 195), and that Caregivers have included Child in their travel plans since he has been placed with them (FOF 196), there appear to be no additional findings that provide specific details as to the Caregivers' financial ability. Here, the Family Court found, based on the record before it, that Caregivers are "financially able" to provide for Child (see FOF 105) and concluded that Caregivers are fit and proper adoptive parents and financially able to give Child a proper home and education under HRS ยง 578-8(a)(3). See FOF 105,
22 COL 19. The 
fact that the record showed, and the Family's Court's findings reflected, Grandmother's strong financial ability does not render the Family Court's finding that Caregivers were "financially able" to provide for Child clearly erroneous. Given the broad discretion afforded to family court decisions, we decline to disturb the Family Court's FOFs and COLs containing mixed findings of fact and conclusions of law, as we cannot conclude that they are clearly erroneous. See JW, 146 Hawai# i at 585, 463 
P.3d at 1242. 
As to Factor 4, Grandmother addresses each of the 
sixteen "best interest" HRS ยง 571-46(b) factors,
23 and contends 
22 FOF 105 states: "The [Caregivers] are financially able to provide
for [Child]." 
23 HRS ยง 571-46 (2018), Criteria and procedure in awarding custody
and visitation; best interest of the child, states: 
(b) In determining what constitutes the best interest of
the child under this section, the court shall consider, but
not be limited to, the following: 
(1) Any history of sexual or physical abuse of a
child by a parent; 
(2) Any history of neglect or emotional abuse of a
child by a parent; (3) The overall quality of the parent-child
relationship; 
(continued...) 
23 23(...continued)  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
that her petition should have been granted because the Family 
Court should not have applied these "discretionary" factors. Grandmother argues that "HRS ยง 578-8(a)(4) requires the court to fashion its own best interest analysis." 
We do not agree that HRS ยง 578-8(a)(4) requires the 
(4) The history of caregiving or parenting by each
parent prior and subsequent to a marital or other type
of separation; 
(5) Each parent's cooperation in developing and
implementing a plan to meet the child's ongoing needs,
interests, and schedule; provided that this factorshall not be considered in any case where the courthas determined that family violence has been committedby a parent; 
(6) The physical health needs of the child; 
(7) The emotional needs of the child; 
(8) The safety needs of the child; 
(9) The educational needs of the child; 
(10) The child's need for relationships with
siblings; (11) Each parent's actions demonstrating that
they allow the child to maintain family
connections through family events andactivities; provided that this factor shall notbe considered in any case where the court hasdetermined that family violence has beencommitted by a parent; 
(12) Each parent's actions demonstrating that they
separate the child's needs from the parent's needs; (13) Any evidence of past or current drug or
alcohol abuse by a parent; (14) The mental health of each parent; 
(15) The areas and levels of conflict present within
the family; and (16) A parent's prior wilful misuse of the protection
from abuse process under chapter 586 to gain a
tactical advantage in any proceeding involving thecustody determination of a minor[.] 
HRS ยงยง 571-46(b)(1)-(16). 
24   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
Family Court to fashion its "own best interest analysis." In In 
re H.A., we noted that while "HRS chapter 578 does not define what constitutes the best interest of the child in the context of adoption proceedings," we observed that "Hawai# i courts have 
often looked to applicable best-interest-of-the-child factors provided in HRS chapter 571 for the purpose of determining custody and visitation in divorce proceedings." 
143 Hawai# i at 
76, 422 P.3d at 654 (citing In the Interest of AS, 130 Hawai# i 
486, 507, 312 P.3d 1193, 1214 (App. 2013), affirmed and clarified by In re AS, 132 Hawai# i 368, 376-77, 322 P.3d 263, 271-72 
(2014)). 
The Family Court's application of the HRS ยง 571-46(b) 
best interest factors to these adoption petitions was not wrong. See id. The Family Court is "granted broad discretion to weigh 
the various factors involved, with no single factor being given presumptive paramount weight, in determining whether the standard has been met." Fisher, 111 Hawai# i at 50, 137 P.3d at 364. 
Grandmother's contention is without merit. 
Grandmother finally contends that under a best 
interests analysis under HRS ยง 578-8(a)(4), kinship should be the "anchor," but the Family Court erroneously treated it as a "non-factor." 
Grandmother argues that kinship is a "mandatory and 
substantial factor," and that in In re AS, "the [supreme] court said that . . . kinship is the 'anchoring proposition in the sea of circumstances.'" Opening Brief at 43. Grandmother mischaracterizes this quote as the holding of the Hawai# i Supreme 
Court when it was not; this quote comes from the concurring opinion by Justices Acoba and Pollack. In re AS, 132 Hawai# i at 
390, 322 P.3d at 285 (Acoba, J. concurring). 
Here, the Family 
Court's conclusions regarding kinship in COL 28, correctly acknowledged that "kinship may be considered a substantial factor in placement decisions." See In re AS, 132 Hawai# i at 377-78, 
322 P.3d at 272-73; In re H.A., 143 Hawai# i at 64, 422 P.3d at 
642. The Family Court ultimately concluded that: "Under the 
25   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
circumstances of this case, the court does not find that 
[Grandmother's] kinship to [Child] is sufficient to overcome the best interest of [Child] being placed with the [Caregivers]. . . . Thus, on the entire record in this case, kinship does not trump all of the other factors set forth in HRS ยง 571-46(b)." COL 29. 
The record reflects that the Family Court carefully 
considered and weighed each of the best interest factors in HRS ยง 571-46(b), and made detailed and comprehensive findings to explain its rationale. We conclude that there was no clear error in the Family Court's determination of what is in the best interests of Child. See In re H.A., 143 Hawai# i at 75, 422 P.3d 
at 653. Accordingly, we do not disturb the Family Court's decision that the adoption of Child by Caregivers was in Child's best interest.
