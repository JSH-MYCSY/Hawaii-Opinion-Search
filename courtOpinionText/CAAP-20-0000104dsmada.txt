Upon consideration of self-represented Petitioner-
Appellant Chris Slavick's (Slavick) July 7, 2020 declaration in
response to the June 24, 2020 order to show cause, the papers in
support, and the records in appellate case numbers CAAP-20-
0000076 and CAAP-20-0000104, it appears that (1) Slavick's
appeals in CAAP-20-0000076 and CAAP-20-0000104 are from the same
January 23, 2020 circuit court order denying his petition for
post-conviction relief under Hawai#i Rules of Penal ProcedureNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Rule 40 in 1PR191000014;  and (2) the appeal in CAAP-20-0000104
should be dismissed as duplicative.1
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal in
CAAP-20-0000104 is dismissed without prejudice to this court's
consideration of the appeal in CAAP-20-0000076.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions in CAAP-
20-0000104 are dismissed.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, September 23, 2020.

1  Slavick filed in the circuit court the notice of appeal that resulted
in the creation of CAAP-20-0000076 and he filed in this court the notice of
appeal that resulted in the creation of CAAP-20-0000104.  Although the notices
of appeal were not identical, they unambiguously were from the same circuit
court order in the same underlying case.  Slavick is cautioned not to file
similar documents to different courts that result in overlapping and
duplicative actions by this court.
