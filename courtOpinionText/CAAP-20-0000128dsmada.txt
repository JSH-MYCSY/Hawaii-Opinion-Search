(CIVIL NO. 5CC161000099) 
ORDER 
DENYING MAY 22, 2020 MOTION TO TEMPORARILY REMAND CASE
AND 
DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Upon review of (1) Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/ 
Appellant/Cross-Appellee Mary Ann O. Fernandes's (Fernandes) and 
Plaintiff/Appellant/Cross-Appellee Mary Ann K. Bode's (Bode) 
May 22, 2020 motion for a temporary remand, (2) the lack of any 
response by Defendant/Counterclaim-Plaintiff/Appellee Annette 
Hashimoto (Annette Hashimoto),  self-represented, and 1
1 Although Alan Hashimoto purported to assert his April 6, 2020
notice of cross-appeal on behalf of both himself and Annette Hashimoto, Alan
Hashimoto is not licensed to practice law in Hawai #i. Under HRS § 605-2
(2016) and HRS § 605-14 (2016), non-attorneys such as Alan Hashimoto "are notpermitted to act as attorneys and represent other natural persons in theircauses." Oahu Plumbing & Sheet Metal, Ltd. v. Kona Constr., Inc., 60 Haw.
372, 377, 590 P.2d 570, 573 (1979) (citation and footnote omitted). In fact,"[a]ny person violating sections 605-14 to 605-16 shall be guilty of amisdemeanor." HRS § 605-17 (2016). As the lone signatory of the April 6, NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #\I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Defendant/Counterclaim-Plaintiff/Appellee/Cross-Appellant Alan 
Hashimoto (Alan Hashimoto), self-represented, to Fernandes's and 
Bode's May 22, 2020 motion, and (3) the record, it appears that 
we lack appellate jurisdiction over Fernandes's and Bode's appeal 
and Alan Hashimoto's cross-appeal from the Honorable Randal G.B. 
Valenciano's October 1, 2019 findings of fact, conclusions of law 
and order and the February 21, 2020 order granting Fernandes's 
motion to dismiss Alan Hashimoto. Further, the requested 
temporary remand is unwarranted, because Fernandes and Bode 
expressly concede in their May 22, 2020 motion that the circuit 
court indicated it would not enter a final judgment at this time 
because the circuit court indicated that it should have denied 
the motion to dismiss Alan Hashimoto. 
Fernandes and Bode correctly observe that this court 
lacks appellate jurisdiction over the appeal and cross-appeal in 
CAAP-20-0000128 because the circuit court has not yet reduced its 
multiple dispositive interlocutory orders to an appealable final 
judgment, as Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (2016) 
requires under Rule 58 of the Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP) and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai# i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994) (In civil 
circuit court cases, "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has 
been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties 
pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]"). 
"[B]ased on Jenkins
 and HRCP 
Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a 
separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai# i 245, 
254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008); Bailey v. DuVauchelle, 135 Hawai# i 482, 489, 353 P.3d 1024, 1031 (2015). The appeal and 
cross-appeal in CAAP-20-0000128 are premature. 
2020 notice of cross-appeal, Alan Hashimoto is the lone cross-appellant. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #\I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In Fernandes's and Bode's May 22, 2020 motion, they 
specifically request that this court temporarily remand this case 
to the circuit court with either (a) instructions for the circuit 
court to amend the February 21, 2020 order granting Fernandes's 
motion to dismiss Alan Hashimoto or (b) instructions "mandating" 
that the circuit court enter an appealable final judgment. 
However, in the absence of an appealable final judgment, the 
circuit court has retained jurisdiction to alter or amend all 
past interlocutory orders, despite the pending appeal. 
"[G]enerally, the filing of a notice of appeal divests the trial 
court of jurisdiction over the appealed case." TSA Int'l Ltd. v. 
Shimizu Corp., 92 Hawai# i 243, 265, 990 P.2d 713, 735 (1999) 
(citations omitted). 
"The general rule, however, assumes that 
the notice of appeal is valid under the applicable statutory provisions and procedural rules. Where the notice of appeal is 
jurisdictionally defective, filing the notice does not transfer jurisdiction from the trial court to the appellate court." State 
v.
 Ontiveros, 82 Hawai# i 446, 449, 923 P.2d 388, 391 (1996) 
(citations omitted; emphasis added). 
Absent an appealable final 
judgment, Fernandes's and Bode's March 10, 2020 notice of appeal and Alan Hashimoto's April 6, 2020 notice of cross-appeal were 
jurisdictionally defective and failed to transfer jurisdiction to 
the Hawai# i Intermediate Court of Appeals. The circuit court 
presently retains jurisdiction to alter or amend any of its past interlocutory orders. 
Fernandes and Bode correctly note that the Supreme 
Court of Hawai# i now holds that, if the record on appeal 
indicates that the circuit court has resolved all claims against all parties, the only thing lacking to perfect an aggrieved 
party's right to obtain appellate review is the entry of the 
final judgment, and the record does not reveal any legitimate 
reason why the circuit court has not entered a final judgment, 
then the 
Hawai# i Intermediate Court of Appeals should invoke HRS 
§ 602-57(3) (2016) and temporarily remand the case to the circuit court with instructions to enter and supplement the record on 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #\I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appeal with an appealable final judgment. Waikiki v. Ho# omaka 
Village Ass'n of Apartment Owners, 140 Hawai# i 197, 204, 398 P.3d 
786, 793 (2017) (footnote omitted). 
However, the present case is 
distinguishable from the circumstances in Waikiki
, where the 
court observed that "[i]t is unclear why the circuit court did 
not enter a final judgment." Id. (footnote omitted). In the 
present case, Fernandes and Bode have expressly represented to this court that the circuit court indicated that it will not 
enter a final judgment because the circuit court now believes 
that it should have denied the motion to dismiss Fernandes's and 
Bode's complaint as to Alan Hashimoto. The record also shows 
that the parties have proposed multiple final judgments, but the 
circuit court has not approved any of them. When, as here, a 
circuit court has indicated that it is not yet ready to enter a 
final judgment because the circuit court has not yet finally 
adjudicated all of the causes of action, a temporary remand 
pursuant to HRS § 602-57(3) and the holding in Waikiki is 
unwarranted. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Fernandes's and 
Bode's May 22, 2020 motion for a temporary remand is denied. 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal and cross-
appeal in appellate court case number CAAP-20-0000128 are 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
