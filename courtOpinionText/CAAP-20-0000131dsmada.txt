KE NOHO KAI COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION, by its Board of Directors,
Plaintiff-Appellant, v. ARMANDO SEDANO, Defendant-Appellee,

DOE GOVERNMENTAL UNITS 1-5, Defendants 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 1CC171000680) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
appellate jurisdiction over Plaintiff-Appellant Ke Noho Kai 
Community Association's (Ke Noho Kai) appeal from the 
February 12, 2020 judgment in Civil No. 17-1-0680-04 (DEO), which 
is based on an order granting Defendant-Appellee Armando Sedano's 
(Sedano) motion to appoint special counsel to represent Sedano in 
Ke Noho Kai's appeal in appellate court case number CAAP-19-
0000844. The February 12, 2020 judgment does not adjudicate any 
of Ke Noho Kai's multiple causes of action against Sedano. 
Pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-1(a) 
(2016) and Rule 58 of the Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP), "[a]n appeal may be taken from circuit court orders NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
resolving claims against parties only after the orders have been 
reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor 
of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to 
HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright
, 76 
Hawai# i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
Ke Noho Kai asserted three counts in its April 26, 2017
complaint against Sedano, but the February 12, 2020 judgment doesnot resolve any of those claims. Although the circuit court 
certified the February 12, 2020 judgment pursuant to HRCP 
Rule 54(b), HRCP Rule 54(b) "certification of finality is limited
to only those cases where . . . the judgment entered completely 
disposes of at least one claim or all of the claims by or against
at least one party." Elliot Megdal & Assocs. v. Daio USA Corp., 
87 
Hawai# i 129, 133, 952 P.2d 886, 890 (App. 1998) (citation 
omitted). Because the circuit court did not adjudicate any causeof action, the circuit court's HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified judgment
"was not final and should not have been certified by the circuit 
court as final pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b)." Elliot Megdal, 87 
Hawai# i at 135, 952 P.2d at 892; see also Fujimoto v. Au, 95 
Hawai# i 116, 136 n.16, 19 P.3d 699, 719 n.16 (2001) (A "circuit 
court's order awarding attorneys' fees and costs may not be 
certified as a final judgment, pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b), 
because such an order is not a final decision with respect to a 
claim for relief." (Citation and internal quotation marks 
omitted)).   
 
 
 
 
The order appointing Sedano's special counsel for 
appeal is not a final decision with respect to any cause of action, and the February 12, 2020 judgment is not an appealable 
final judgment. The record indicates the circuit court has not 
yet adjudicated any of Ke Noho Kai's multiple causes of action 
that remain unresolved and pending before the circuit court. Ke

Noho Kai's appeal is premature, and we lack appellate 
jurisdiction. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court 
case number CAAP-20-0000131 is dismissed for lack of appellate 
jurisdiction.
