NO. CAAP-20-0000134 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I  
AS, Plaintiff-Appellee, v. WS, Defendant-Appellee,
and EC and BD, Movants-Appellants 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
(FC-D NO. 04-1-0002) 
ORDER 
DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
AND 
DISMISSING AS MOOT ALL PENDING MOTIONS IN CAAP-20-0000134 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record of this appeal arising out of 
a post-judgment proceeding in a divorce case, it appears that we 
lack appellate jurisdiction over this appeal by Movants-
Appellants E.C. (E.C.)1 and B.D. (B.D.) from the February 26, 
2020 post-judgment order granting in part and denying in part E.C.'s and B.D.'s January 6, 2020 post-judgment motion to unseal 
records from the divorce proceedings between Plaintiff-Appellee 
A.S. (A.S.) and Defendant-Appellee W.S. (W.S.) in Family Court 
case number FC-D No. 04-1-0002, because the February 26, 2020 
post-judgment order does not qualify as an appealable final post-

the divorcing parties' minor child, we refer to the parties according to their
initials rather than their full names in accordance with Rule 3(c)(1) of the
Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
judgment order under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 571-54 
(2018). 
In Family Court cases "[a]n interested party, aggrieved 
by any order or decree of the court, may appeal to the 
intermediate appellate court for review of questions of law and 
fact upon the same terms and conditions as in other cases in the 
circuit court[.]" HRS ยง 571-54. On September 4, 2009, the 
Family Court entered a divorce decree that satisfied the 
requirements for appealability under HRS ยง 571-54 and the holding 
in Eaton v. Eaton, 7 Haw. App. 111, 118-19, 748 P.2d 801, 805 
(1987). 
Once the Family Court entered the September 4, 2009 
divorce decree, all subsequent orders were post-judgment orders, 
and a Family Court "post-judgment order is an appealable final 
order . . . if the order finally determines the post-judgment 
proceeding." Hall v. Hall
, 96 Hawai# i 105, 111 n.4, 26 P.3d 594, 
600 n.4 (App. 2001) (citation omitted), 
affirmed in part, and 
vacated in part on other grounds, Hall v. Hall
, 95 Hawai# i 318, 
22 P.3d 965 (2001). 
The February 26, 2020 post-judgment order did not 
finally determine all of the issues, and, thus, did not end the post-judgment proceeding for E.C.'s and B.D.'s January 6, 2020 
post-judgment motion to unseal records from the divorce 
proceedings between A.S. and W.S. 
The February 26, 2020 post-
judgment order granted E.C.'s and B.D.'s January 6, 2020 post-judgment motion to the limited extent that E.C. and B.D. 
requested the Family Court to unseal pleadings, motions, 
documents, or declarations filed by A.S., any statements made by 
A.S. in family court transcripts, and any records containing 
information specific to A.S.'s finances with private account 
information redacted. The February 26, 2020 post-judgment order 
denied E.C.'s and B.D.'s January 6, 2020 post-judgment motion to 
the limited extent that E.C. and B.D. requested the Family Court 
to unseal pleadings, motions, documents, or declarations filed by 
W.S. and any statements made by W.S. in Family Court transcripts. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
However, the February 26, 2020 post-judgment order concluded by 
providing that E.C., B.D. and W.S. stipulated that a Special 
Master, whose fees will be paid by E.C. and B.D., will review the 
case file and, at some time in the future, determine what 
information to redact and which documents to provide to E.C. and 
D.B. 
Therefore, we conclude that the Family Court has not 
yet determined the exact scope of the records that E.C. and B.D. 
will be allowed to access, and, at some point in the future, the 
Special Master will apparently recommend to the Family Court what 
information to redact and which documents to provide to E.C. and 
B.D., after which the Family Court will presumably issue a formal 
order designating exactly the records that E.C. and D.B. will be 
allowed to access. E.C.'s and B.D.'s appeal is premature at this 
point in time, and we lack appellate jurisdiction under HRS 
ยง 571-54. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, that CAAP-20-0000134 
is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions 
in CAAP-20-0000134 are dismissed as moot. 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED as follows: 
1. The appellate clerk shall designate for in camera 
review the record on appeal filed at dockets 27, 29, 31, and 33, 
on May 12, 2020, without prejudice to the Family Court's further 
orders concerning the January 6, 2020 post-judgment motion or 
further relief in any subsequent appeal. 
2. With respect to the record on appeal, filed May 12, 
2020, except for documents contained in the record on appeal that 
were filed in the underlying case on or after January 2, 2020, 
and the Family Court clerk's minutes for February 13, 2020, E.C., 
B.D., and their counsel shall (a) immediately delete or destroy 
any paper, electronic, digital, or facsimile copies or notes, 
recordings, or images of any document or image obtained from the 
record on appeal; (b) not use at any time in any manner for any 
purpose any information obtained from the record on appeal that

is not otherwise publicly available; (c) not distribute or 
publish any paper, electronic, digital, or facsimile copies or 
notes, recordings, or images of any document or image obtained 
from the record on appeal; and (d) if E.C., B.D., or their 
counsel have distributed or published any paper, electronic, 
digital, or facsimile copies or notes, recordings, or images of 
any document or image obtained from the record on appeal, then 
they shall immediately retrieve the item from the recipient and 
destroy it, or instruct the recipient to destroy it and not 
distribute, duplicate, or publish the item or any information 
obtained from it that is not otherwise publicly available. 
Failure to comply with this portion of the order may result in 
sanctions. 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that the court reporters 
shall not prepare and file in this appeal transcripts of any 
"Unknown/Sealed" proceedings requested by E.C. and B.D. on 
March 12, 2020. 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that the appellate clerk 
shall serve this order on the Clerk of the Family Court of the 
Fifth Circuit and Supervising Court Reporter Melissa Noble.
