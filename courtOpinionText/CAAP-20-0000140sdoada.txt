ONOLULU DIVISION 
(CASE NO. 1DTC-19-041405) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Connor B. Gray (Gray) appeals from 
the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, 
filed February 11, 2020, in the District Court of the First Circuit (
District Court).  Gray was convicted of Operating a 
Vehicle After License and Privilege Have Been Suspended or Revoked for Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVLPSR-OVUII), in violation of Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS) § 291E-62(a)(1) and/or (a)(2) (Supp. 2018).

Gray raises a single point of error on appeal, 
contending that there was not substantial evidence to support his 
conviction. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve Gray's point of error as follows and affirm. 
Gray is alleged to have committed OVLPSR-OVUII for an 
incident that occurred on May 14, 2019. He was previously arrested for Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII) on May 6, 2018. Gray contends there was 
insufficient proof to demonstrate the requisite intent to commit 
OVLPSR-OVUII because there was no substantial evidence that he had received the Administrative Driver's License Revocation Office's (ADLRO) decision that "affirm[ed]" his license 
revocation and set forth the dates of the revocation. 
We review a sufficiency of the evidence challenge as 
follows: 
[E]vidence adduced in the trial court must be
considered in the strongest light for the prosecutionwhen the appellate court passes on the legalsufficiency of such evidence to support aconviction[.] . . . The test on appeal is not whetherguilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt, butwhether there was substantial evidence to support theconclusion of the trier of fact. . . . "Substantial evidence" . . . is credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable aperson of reasonable caution to support a conclusion.

The state of mind required to establish an offense 
under HRS § 291E-62 is not specified and, therefore, 
is established if a person acts intentionally, knowingly, or 
(1) In violation of any restrictions placed on the
person's license;
(2) While the person's license or privilege tooperate a vehicle remains suspended orrevoked[.]

recklessly. HRS § 702-204 (2014). "A person acts recklessly 
with respect to attendant circumstances when he consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances exist." HRS § 702-206(3)(b) (2014). 
A risk is substantial and unjustifiable within the
meaning of this section if, considering the nature andpurpose of the person's conduct and the circumstancesknown to him, the disregard of the risk involves agross deviation from the standard of conduct that alaw-abiding person would observe in the samesituation. 
HRS § 702-206(3)(d) (2014). 
"[G]iven the difficulty of proving the requisite state 
of mind by direct evidence in criminal cases, we have 
consistently held that proof by circumstantial evidence and reasonable inferences arising from circumstances surrounding the defendant's conduct is sufficient." State v. Stocker, 90 
Hawai#i 85, 92, 976 P.2d 399, 406 (1999) (brackets, ellipsis, 
citation & internal quotation marks omitted). 
"Thus, the mind 
of an alleged offender may be read from his acts, conduct and inferences fairly drawn from all the circumstances." Id. 
(citation & internal quotation marks omitted). 
Here, there is substantial evidence that Gray received 
an administrative review decision, or at a minimum was informed about the administrative review decision, that revoked his license. He requested an administrative hearing, and a request for a hearing can only be made after an administrative review decision is issued that revoked a license. See
 HRS § 291E-38(a) 
(Supp. 2018). The ADLRO's August 10, 2018 "Notice of Withdrawal of Request for Hearing" (August 10, 2018 Notice), which states 
"ADMINISTRATIVE REVOCATION SUSTAINED" and that Gray's license and 
privilege to operate a vehicle was revoked from "6/6/2018 to 6/5/2019," also includes the following remarks: 
Prior to the commencement of the hearing scheduled for
8/8/18, Respondent, through and as approved byCounsel, withdrew his request for a hearing. See,Withdrawal dated 8/8/18. Therefore, the Notice ofAdministrative Review Decision dated 5/14/18 isaffirmed and shall continue and remain in full force and effect.

(Emphasis added.) The August 10, 2018 Notice is addressed to 
"Connor B. Gray c/o Scott Collins, Esq.," and Gray testified that Scott Collins (Collins) represented him at that time. Thus, it 
is reasonable to infer from the evidence that Gray was aware his 
license was revoked because he requested an administrative hearing. Gray consciously disregarded the substantial and unjustifiable risk that his license remained revoked or restricted when he drove on May 14, 2019, the date of the subject incident in this case. See State v. Benitez, CAAP-17-0000143, 
2018 WL 2752359, at *2 (App. June 8, 2018) (SDO). 
Additionally, Officer Jesse Takushi (Officer Takushi) 
testified regarding events that previously occurred on May 6, 2018, when Officer Takushi arrested Gray for OVUII. Officer Takushi testified that after arresting Gray, he read a four-page Notice of Administrative Revocation form (Revocation Form) 
"verbatim" to Gray, and that Gray signed the form. Officer 
Takushi informed Gray that ADLRO may revoke his license, and that ADLRO would mail Gray a copy of the administrative review decision. The Revocation Form indicated, inter alia, that Gray was arrested for OVUII; the administrative review decision shall be mailed to him no later than eight days after the date of the issuance of "this Notice" (the Revocation Form); and if his license is not administratively revoked after the administrative review or if an administrative revocation is reversed, he would receive, inter alia, a certified statement that the administrative revocation proceedings have been terminated. Gray does not contend that he received any indication that the revocation proceedings were terminated; rather, he testified that he never received notice of the ADLRO decision stating the time period that his license was revoked and that when he was stopped on May 14, 2019, he did not know whether his license had been revoked. Based on the foregoing, this testimony and documentary evidence also establishes sufficient evidence that Gray consciously disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk that

his license was revoked when he drove on May 14, 2019. See State 
v. Rios, CAAP-19-0000718, 2021 WL 964862, at *2 (App. Mar. 15, 
2021) (SDO). 
Accordingly, the District Court's February 11, 2020 
Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment is affirmed.
