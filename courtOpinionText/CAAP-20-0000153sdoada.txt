IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v. 
JOHN KEONI JARDINE, also known as JOHN KEONI JARDINE III
and JOHN JARDINE III, Defendant-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CR. NO. 1CPC-19-0001233) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Plaintiff-Appellant State of Hawai# i appeals from the 
"Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Granting 
Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Felony Information Based Upon a Defective Charge, Filed 1/27/20" (
Order) entered by the Circuit 
Court of the First Circuit on February 20, 2020.1 For the 
reasons explained below, we affirm the Order. 
Defendant-Appellee John Keoni Jardine (also known as 
John Keoni Jardine III and John Jardine III) was charged by felony information with assault in the second degree in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707-711(1)(a) and/or (1)(d). 
Jardine moved to dismiss the charge. The circuit court dismissed 
the charge without prejudice, concluding that the charge was defective because it failed to recite the statutory definitions

of "substantial bodily injury" and "dangerous instrument." This 
appeal followed. 
"Whether a charge sets forth all the essential elements 
of a charged offense is a question of law, which [an appellate court] reviews under the de novo, or right/wrong, standard." State v. Kauhane, 145 Hawai# i 362, 369, 452 P.3d 359, 366 (2019) 
(cleaned up). 
"A charge's essential elements include conduct, 
attendant circumstances, and results of conduct." Kauhane, 145 
Hawai# i at 370, 452 P.3d at 367 (citing HRS § 702-205 (2014)) 
(other citations omitted). 
"Where a statute sets forth with 
reasonable clarity all essential elements of the crime intended to be punished, and fully defines the offense in unmistakable terms readily comprehensible to persons of common understanding, a charge drawn in the language of the statute will be sufficient." Id. (cleaned up). 
However, where the statutory 
definition of an element of the crime "does not necessarily coincide with its common meaning[,]" State v. Baker, 146 Hawai# i 
299, 307, 463 P.3d 956, 964 (2020), the statutory definition must be included in the charge. State v. Pacquing, 139 Hawai# i 302, 
308, 389 P.3d 897, 903 (2016). 
Jardine was charged with violation of HRS § 707-
711(1)(a) and/or (1)(d). HRS § 707-711 (2014 & Supp. 2018) provides, in relevant part: 
Assault in the second degree.  (1) A person commits the
offense of assault in the second degree if: 
(a) The person intentionally, knowingly, or
recklessly causes substantial bodily injury  to 
another; [or] 
. . . . 
(d) The person intentionally or knowingly causesbodily injury  to another with a dangerous
instrument [.] 
(Emphasis added.)

The felony information charging Jardine stated: 
On or about August 25, 2019, in the City and County of
Honolulu, State of Hawaii, JOHN KEONI JARDINE . . . did
intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly cause substantial 
bodily injury  to Paul Costa, and/or did intentionally or
knowingly cause bodily injury to Paul Costa with a dangerous
instrument , thereby committing the offense of Assault in the
Second Degree, in violation of Section 707-711(l)(a) and/orSection 707-711 (l)(d) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes. 
(Emphasis added.) 
The issues presented by this appeal are whether the 
statutory definitions of "substantial bodily injury" and 
"dangerous instrument" coincide with the common meanings of those terms. Concerning "substantial bodily injury," the Oxford Learner's American English Dictionary contains the following definitions: 
substantial : large in amount, value, or importance2 
bodily : connected with the human body3 
injury : harm done to a person's or an animal's body4 
HRS § 707-700 (2014) provides, in relevant part: 
"Bodily injury" means physical pain, illness, or any
impairment of physical condition. 
. . . . 
"Substantial bodily injury" means bodily injury which
causes: 
(1) A major avulsion, laceration, or penetration of
the skin; 
(2) A burn of at least second degree severity;

(3) A bone fracture; 
(4) A serious concussion; or (5) A tearing, rupture, or corrosive damage to the
esophagus, viscera, or other internal organs. 
The HRS § 707-700 definition of "substantial bodily injury" is 
limited to five specific types of bodily injury. The common meaning of "substantial bodily injury" could encompass more types of bodily injury than the five specified in the statute. Because the common meaning of "substantial bodily injury" is broader than the statutory definition, the charge against Jardine was defective. See, e.g., Kauhane, 145 Hawai# i at 371, 452 P.3d at 
368 (common meaning of "obstructs" was broader than defined term in Obstructing statute, HRS § 711-1105); Pacquing, 139 Hawai# i at 
308, 389 P.3d at 903 (common meaning of "confidential personal information" was broader than defined term in UPCPI statute, HRS § 708-839.55); State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai# i 383, 394, 219 
P.3d 1170, 1181 (2009) (common meaning of "operate" was broader than defined term in OVUII statute, HRS § 291E-61). 
Quoting State v. Mita, 124 Hawai# i 385, 245 P.3d 458 
(2010), the State argues that requiring inclusion of the statutory definition of "substantial bodily injury" "would render charges unduly complex, in contravention of the policy reflected in [
Hawai# i Rules of Penal Procedure] Rule 7(d) that '[t]he 
charge shall be a plain, concise and definite statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged.'" Id. at 392, 
245 P.3d at 465. 
The supreme court has noted, however, that if 
the statutory definition of an element of an offense is complex or lengthy, the specific conduct, attendant circumstance, or result of conduct may be specified in a "to wit" clause of the charge. See Pacquing, 139 Hawai# i at 308, 389 P.3d at 903 ("The 
State should have included in the charge the statutory definition of 'confidential personal information' under HRS § 708-800 
or at 
least specified in the charge the items of information that 
allegedly were unlawfully possessed.") (emphasis added). 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The State's argument lacks merit under the 
circumstances of this case. The charge against Jardine neither 
recited the statutory definition of "substantial bodily injury" nor specified what type of bodily injury Jardine allegedly inflicted upon the complaining witness. The circuit court did not err by dismissing the felony information without prejudice on that basis. 
In light of the foregoing, we need not reach the 
State's other arguments. We affirm the circuit court's Order entered on February 20, 2020.
