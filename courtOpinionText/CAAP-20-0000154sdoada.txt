SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka  and Nakasone,  JJ.)  
This is an appeal from an ejectment case arising out 
of the cancellation of a residential lease for nonpayment. 
Defendant -Appellant Juliana K.L.O. Montalvo ( Montalvo ) 
appeals from the (1) December 2 3, 2019 "Judgment for 
Possession "; and (2) March 11, 2020 "Order Denying Defendant's 
Motion for Reconsideration , Filed January 2, 2020 " (Order

Denying Reconsideration ),1 both filed and entered by the District 
Court of the Second Circuit ( District Court ).2 
On appeal, Montalvo contends that the District Court 
erred by: ( 1) granting summary judgment in favor of Plaintiff -
Appellee Department of Hawaiian Homelands, State of Hawai ‘i 
(DHHL) and denying Montalvo's motion for reconsideration 
"because it did not have subject matter jurisdiction to rule on 
issues involving title to Montalvo's property and to consider 
Montalvo's equitable arguments"; (2) granting summary judgment 
in favor of DHHL "because Montalvo raised serious due process 
violations with regard to DHHL's claim that Montalvo's lease had 
been cancelled" ; and (3) granting summary judgment "because 
Montalvo presented material issues of fact with regard to her 
ability to cure any default."3 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the argument s advanced and the issues raised, we resolve 
Montalvo's points of error as follows, and affirm. 
  On April 8, 2005, Montalvo's mother entered into a 
ninety-nine-year-term residential lease  (Lease) with DHHL for a 
property located on the island of Maui, Hawai‘i (Property ).   
Montalvo's mother assigned her interest in the Lease to

Montalvo. Pursuant to the assignment, Montalvo obtained a 
mortgage loan from First Magnus Financial Corporation in the 
amount of $ 175,676.00 ; in May of 2009, however, Montalvo became 
delinquent in her loan payments. 
On July 16, 2009, DHHL's Hawaiian Homes Commission 
(Commission ) held a contested case hearing to determine whether 
Montalvo was delinquent on her loan payments. After the 
hearing, Montalvo entered into a stipulated agreement with DHHL , 
acknowledging Montalvo was "delinquent in the amount of 
$29,030.64  as of May 15, 2009"; Montalvo would make monthly 
payments of $1,167.00  to DHHL ; and if Montalvo failed to pay, 
Montalvo would have sixty days to cure any delinquen cy and/or 
transfer the lease to another qu alified Hawaiian. The 
Commission filed its November 16, 2009 Findings of Fact ( FOFs), 
Conclusions of Law ( COLs) and Decision and Order ( 2009 Order ) 
that contained the same terms . 
On May 25, 2011, the Commission held a hearing 
regarding Montalvo's non -compliance with the 2009 Order. 
Montalvo was not present, but submit ted written testimony. The 
Commission filed its June 28, 2011 FOFs, COLs and Final Decision 
and Order ( 2011 Order ), in which it ordered the Lease 
"immediately cancelled "; that Montalvo pay "[a]ll principal and 
accrued interest due and owing" on the mortgage loan ; and that 
Montalvo and her family "vacate the premises." 
Montalvo subsequently sent a letter to DHHL requesting 
a "loan modification," so that she could "consistently make 
payments on time and avoid a foreclosure." Following October 18 
and 23, 2012 hearing s, DHHL denied the request , and filed its 
November 29, 2012 Order Denying Request for Reconsideration and 
Affirming June 28, 2011 FOFs, COLs and Final Decision and Order 
(2012 Order Denying Reconsideration ). The 2012 Order Denying

Reconsideration provided that Montalvo had thirty days after 
service of a certified copy of the order to appeal. 
Montalvo never appealed the 2012 Order Denying 
Reconsideration . 
Approximately seven years later, on October 10, 2019, 
DHHL filed a n ejectment complaint in the District Court to 
remove Montalvo and her family from the Property, and for a 
judgment and writ of possession . The Complaint alleged that a 
"certified copy of the 2012 Order [Denying Reconsideration] was 
sent to [Montalvo] on December 4, 2012[,]" which cancelled the 
Lease. 
On November 13, 2019, DHHL filed a Motion for Summary 
Judgment ( MSJ), arguing that the Lease was cancelled pursuant to 
the 2012 Order Denying Reconsideration; Montalvo never appealed 
the 2012 Order Denying Reconsideration, which made it final ; and 
that any argument by Montalvo contest ing the 2012 Order Denying 
Reconsideration was a prohibited collateral attack .4 
On November 29, 2019, Montalvo filed an opposition to 
the MSJ (MSJ Opposition ), arguing that she had the right to cure 
and was able to cure the default, but that DHHL would not allow 
her to do so. Montalvo's MSJ Opposition acknowledged, and did 
not challenge, that the Lease was cancelled, and also conceded 
that she did not appeal.5 The MSJ Opposition focused on

declaration of DHHL enforcement officer, Kip Akana; the Lease; assignment of 
the Lease; the 2009 stipulated agreement between DHHL and Montalvo; 2009 
Order; 2011 Order; the 2012 Order Denying Reconsideration ; and a certificate 
of service f or the 2012 Order Denying Reconsideration . 
5 The MSJ Opposition stated in its "Factual Background" section 
that: 
On May 25, 2011, the Commission conducted a hearing at its 
Kauai District Office on [DHHL]'s request for an order 
cancelling the Lease. On June 28, 2011 Commission [sic] 
ordered Mrs. Montalvo's interest in the Property forfeited, 
Lease [sic] immediately cancelled, and vacation of the 
Property within sixty (60) days of service ("Final Order").

Montalvo's right to cure, framing the right as "her current, 
existing right, today , to cure the default and remain in 
possession and tenancy under the Lease"; asserting that the "right to cure is found in the mortgage, in statutory and common law, in equity and in trust law"; and presenting  arguments that 
set forth  each of these legal grounds for Montalvo's right to 
cure. 
6 
At the December 9, 2019 hearing on the MSJ, the 
District Court granted the MSJ, ruling the 2011 Order 
"terminate [d] . . . [Montalvo ]'s interest in the [P]roperty" and 
"revested that interest " to DHHL; Montalvo did not appeal the 
2012 Order Denying Reconsideration that followed , which was a 
"final decision." 
On December 23, 2019, the District Court filed its 
Order Granting DHHL's MSJ and the Judgment for Possession. 
On January 2, 2020, Montalvo filed a Motion for 
Reconsideration. Montalvo argued that she never received a copy 
of the 2012 Order Denying Reconsideration; that the time to file 
an appeal of the 2012 Order Denying Reconsideration did not 
start to run ; and that she did not receive a copy of the order 
Following a hearing on October 23, 2012, Mrs. Montalvo's 
request for reconsideration of the Final Order was denied. 
No appeal was taken. 
The Opposition also acknowledged: "To be sure, Mrs. Montalvo does not 
dispute that there was a lease, that there was a default, that the Commission 
took action and that no appeal was filed." 
6 Montalvo s pecifically argued that : she "retain[ed] rights under 
the lease as a holdover tenant"; "retain[ed] a right to reinstate the 
mortgage"; DHHL as trustee "should respect the right to cure" by Montalvo who 
is a "beneficiary " of the H awaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920 with "a 
beneficial interest in the Property" ; ejecting Montalvo "would be inequitable 
and would work a forfeiture " and "equity abhors forfeiture"; and the District 
Court should order the parties to mediation.

until 2016.7 On March 11, 2020, the District Court filed its 
Order Denying Reconsideration. Montalvo timely appealed. 
(1) Montalvo argues the District Court lacked 
subject matter jurisdiction because the ejectment action 
involved "title to the Property" (title-based challenge ), and 
the District Court lacked "equitable powers" to consider 
Montalvo's "equitable arguments" (equity-based challenge ).8 
  "The existence of jurisdiction is a question of law 
that we review de novo under the right/wrong standard." Lingle, 
107 Hawai‘i at  182-83, 111 P.3d at  591-92  (citation omitted).  
  As for Montalvo's title-based challenge to 
jurisdiction, DHHL responds  that Montalvo did "not comply with 
court rules" such as Hawaii
 District Court Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HDCRCP) Rule 12.1,  which specifically prescribes how 
a title-based defense must be raised.   This argument is 
persuasive.  9
7 None of these arguments were raised in Montalvo's MSJ Opposition. 
 8   Although  Montalvo's arguments regarding subject matter 
jurisdiction are argued for the first time on appeal, "[q]uestions  regarding 
subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any stage of a cause of action." 
Lingle v. Hawaii  Government Employees  Ass'n,  AFSCME, Local 152 AFL -CIO, 107 
Hawai‘i  178,  182-83, 111 P.3d 587  591-92  (2005) (citation omitted).   
Accordingly, we address them.  
9 HDCRCP Rule 12.1, entitled " Defense of Title in District Courts ," 
states: 
Pleadings.   Whenever, in the district court, in defense of 
an action  in the nature of an action of trespass or for the 
summary possession of land, or any other action, the 
defendant shall seek to interpose a defense to the 
jurisdiction  to the effect that the action is a real 
action, or one in which the title to real estate is 
involved, such defense shall be asserted by a written 
answer or written motion, which shall not be received by 
the court unless accompanied by an affidavit of the 
defendant, setting forth the source, nature and extent of the title claimed by defendant to the land in question, and 
such further particulars as shall fully apprise the court 
of the nature of defendant's claim.  
(Emphases added.) 
6        
 
 
 
   Under HRS § 604-5, the District Court generally does 
not have jurisdiction over "actions in which the title to real 
estate comes in question[.]" HRS § 604-5(d) (2016). HDCRCP Rule 12.1 requires a defendant challenging title to submit a written answer or motion and an affidavit or declaration by the defendant asserting "the source, nature and extent of the title claimed."   Montalvo did not comply with these requirements. Her 
title-based challenge to jurisdiction lacks merit.   See  Deutsche 
Bank Nat'l  Tr.  Co. v. Peelua, 126 Hawai ʻi 32, 39, 265 P.3d 1128, 
1135 (2011) (holding that because respondent did not "establish that title was in question, by way of an affidavit under [H]DCRCP Rule 12.1[,]"  and "no other particulars were set forth 
so as to apprise the court fully of the nature of his claim," 
respondent "failed to establish that title was in question"); 
Aames Funding Corp. v. Mores, 107 Hawaii 95, 99-100, 110 P.3d 
1042, 1046-47  (2005) (determining that because appellant did not 
comply with Rule 12.1 requirements, appellant failed to raise a 
lack of subject matter
-jurisdiction defense).  
  Montalvo's equity-based challenge to jurisdiction also 
lacks merit.  
 
 
 
 
     
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In Lum v. Sun , 70 Haw. 288, 769 P.2d 1091 (1989), the 
Hawaii Supreme Court held that the district court has the 
exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate the summary possession 
claim and that when a timely demand for a jury trial is 
made pertaining to other claims, counterc laims, and legal 
and equity issues, those matters should be transferred to 
the circuit court for trial by jury. Thus, it follows that 
if Defendants wanted their equity issues adjudicated, it 
was their burden to initiate appropriate proceedings in the 
circuit court.

App. 162, 189, 862 P.2d 282, 294 (1993).

and that "equity abhors forfeiture." The record reflects no

  We conclude the District Court had jurisdiction in 
this case. See  Lingle, 107 Hawaii at 182-83, 111 P.3d at 591-
92.  jurisdictional challenge when Montalvo raised this "equity" 
argument to the District Court ; nor did Montalvo timely demand a 
jury trial or request transfer to a circuit court , consistent 
with her burden to do so as a defendant who "wanted their equity 
issues adjudicated [.]" Id. 
(2) Montalvo argues that summary judgment should not 
have been granted because of various "serious due process 
violations," which include: Montalvo was denied the opportunity 
to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaning ful manner when 
the Commission held the 2011 contested case hearing "on Kauai 
and not Maui"; Montalvo "never received notice of the [2012 
Order Denying Reconsideration ] so that she could appeal"; and 
Montalvo "raised questions of fact sufficient to deny summary 
judgment ." These arguments are waived. 
  Montalvo's due process arguments  regarding the 
location of the 2011 hearing and the notice of the 2012 Order 
Denying Reconsideration were not raised in the MSJ Opposition,  
and they are waived. See  Haw. Ventures, LLC  v. Otaka, Inc., 114 
Hawaiʻi 438,  500, 164 P.3d 696,  758  (2007).   Montalvo's argument 
that "there is a question of fact as to whether Montalvo's lease had in fact been cancelled" was also not raised in her MSJ Opposition  and is waived. See  id.   This argument is also 
inconsistent with her acknowledgment in the opposition  that the 
"Lease [was] immediately cancelled" in the 2011 Order.  
(3) Montalvo argues that her "ability to cure her 
default raised questions of fact sufficient to deny summary 
judgment." This argument lacks merit. 
In an ejectment action, a plaintiff must prove two 
elements : (1) that plaintiff owns the parcel in issue and (2)

that  possession is unlawfully withheld by another. Kondaur Cap.  
Corp. v. Matsuyoshi, 136 Hawaii 227, 241, 361 P.3d 454, 468 
(2015). For summary judgment  purposes, "[a] fact is material if 
proof of that fact would have the effect of establishing or 
refuting one of the essential elements of a cause of action or defense asserted by the parties." Haw.  Cmty. Fed. Credit Union 
v. Keka, 94 Hawaii 213,  221,  11 P.3d 1, 9 (2000) (cleaned up).  
Here, the record of the 2 012 Order Denying 
Reconsideration reflects that Montalvo's loan was still 
"delinquent" as of the October 23, 2012 hearing on the 
reconsideration; and the order reiterated what was previously 
set forth in the 2011 Order , that: Montalvo's "interest in the 
premises demised under the Lease . . . is forfeited"; "[t]he 
Lease is immediately cancelled"; Montalvo's "right . . . to use 
and occupy the premises demised under the Lease is terminated, 
the interest in the premises is revested in [DHHL]"; and 
Montalvo "vac ate the premises ." (Cleaned up.) Thus, there were 
no material facts in dispute for the ejectment claim, where DHHL 
adduced evidence of its ownership of the Property, and that 
Montalvo's possession of the Property was unlawful. See 
Kondaur, 136 Hawai‘i at 241, 361 P.3d at 468. Montalvo's ability 
to cure her default was not a material fact that would prove or 
disprove either of these ejectment elements. See Haw. Cmty Fed. 
Credit Union , 94 Hawai‘i at 221, 11 P.3d at 9. 
We conclude t he District Court did not err by granting 
summary judgment on DHHL's ejectment claim . See Thomas v. 
Kidani, 126 Hawai ‘i 125, 127 -28, 267 P.3d 1230, 1232 -33 (2011)
