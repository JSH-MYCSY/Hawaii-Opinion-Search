APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(Case No. 1CCV-19-0002169) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka and McCullen, JJ.) 
This appeal involves three lawsuits pending in the 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit. 
The first was filed by 
Pinmei Wang against several defendants on October 24, 2019.  The 
second was filed by Wang and 16 more plaintiffs  against the same 
defendants, plus one new defendant,  on October 31, 2019. The 
third was filed by the plaintiffs in the second lawsuit, plus ten 321
1 The named defendants were Zhong Fang aka Johnson Fang; Mei Hu aka
Michelle Hu; Jiajia Wang; Zhe Fang; Lamei Fang; Hawaii City Plaza LP, HawaiiOcean Plaza LP; California Regional Center LLC; and California InvestmentRegional Center LLC. 
2 The new plaintiffs were Tao Jiang; Chuanjiao Yu; Tiange Yang;
Xiaomin Huang; Xiaohui Wu; Yuyang Jing; Li Wang; Dong Zhang; Ke Yuan; WeiJiang; Xiujuan Li; Songhua Zhang; Yihao Xu; Wei Wang; Ruigang Tan; and JingLiu. 
3 The new defendant was Wuhan Western U.S. Investment Immigration
Consultant Inc.

new plaintiffs,4 against all except one of the defendants named 
in the second lawsuit,5 plus five new defendants,6 on 
November 18, 2019. The complaints and amended complaints in each 
lawsuit were materially identical. 
Notices of pendency of action under Hawaii Revised 
Statutes ( HRS) § 634-51 ( lis pendens ) were filed in each lawsuit. 
The defendants moved to expunge the lis pendens . The circuit 
court entered orders granting the motions on March 16, 2020.7 
The circuit court consolidated the lawsuits. After 
consolidation, the defendants moved to "dismiss and/or strike duplicative actions." The circuit court entered orders granting the motions on March 16, 2020. 
The plaintiffs appeal from the orders expunging the lis 
pendens and granting the motions to dismiss and/or strike.
(1) The orders granting the defendants' motions to 
dismiss and/or strike were identical. The first and second lawsuits were dismissed, but each order stated: 
4. The Plaintiffs shall be given leave to amend the
complaint to consolidate all claims and causes of action
into the case of Yanli Xu, et al. v. Zhong Fang, et al.(Civil No. 1CCV-19-0002169) [the third lawsuit]. 
The orders did not dispose of any claim against any 
party. They were not reduced to separate judgments in favor of 
and against the appropriate parties under Hawai#i Rules of Civil 
Procedure ( HRCP) Rule 58 or certified for appeal under HRCP 
Rule 54(b). Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright , 76 
Hawai#i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). They were not

Atsushi Morita; Jubee Aizawa; Kasumi Ishida; Tatsuto Ehara; Makoto Ishida;
Hun-Dong Yu; and Lili Wu. 
5 Wuhan Western U.S. Investment Immigration Consultant Inc. was not
named as a defendant in the third lawsuit. 
6 The new defendants were USA Realty Construction Group Inc.;
American Investment Immigration Fund; Los Angeles City Plaza LP; LA ValleyGarden Plaza LP; and 9920 Valley Blvd LP. 
7 The Honorable Dean E. Ochiai presided.

appealable under the collateral order doctrine or the Forgay 
doctrine. See Greer v. Baker, 137 Hawai #i 249, 253, 369 P.3d 
832, 836 (2016). 
The record does not reflect that the circuit 
court allowed an interlocutory appeal under HRS § 641-1(b). The plaintiffs' appeal from the orders granting the defendants' motions to dismiss and/or strike is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
(2) The orders granting the defendants' motions to 
expunge the lis pendens  are appealable under the collateral order 
doctrine. See Knauer v. Foote, 101 Hawaii# 81, 84–85, 63 P.3d 
389, 392–93 (2003). We review for abuse of discretion. S. Utsunomiya Enters., Inc. v. Moomuku Country Club, 75 Haw. 480, 504, 866 P.2d 951, 964 (1994). 
Lis pendens  is authorized only in "actions directly 
seeking to obtain title to or possession of real property." Utsunomiya , 75 Haw. at 510, 866 P.2d at 966. 
The nature of the 
action is determined on the face of the complaint without regard to likelihood of success on the merits. Id. at 505-06, 866 P.2d at 964. The plaintiffs' first amended complaints were the operative complaints in each lawsuit when the orders expunging the lis pendens  were entered. See id. at 506, 866 P.2d at 964 
(analyzing amended complaint filed in response to motion to expunge lis pendens ). We do not consider the second amended 
complaint filed in the third lawsuit because it was filed after entry of the order expunging the lis pendens . 
The plaintiffs claim to have invested money, through 
the defendants, in two EB-5 entities,
8 Hawaii City Plaza LP  and 
Hawaii Ocean Plaza LP . They claimed the defendants fraudulently 
induced their investments, mismanaged the EB-5 entities, commingled their funds, and underfunded and significantly delayed the EB-5 entities' real estate development projects. The 
8 EB-5 is a federal program under which foreign investors are
eligible to apply for lawful permanent residence if they meet certain
requirements. See EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program , https://www.uscis.gov/
working-in-the-united-states/permanent-workers/eb-5-immigrant-investor-program(last visited May 22, 2024) [https://perma.cc/FQL3-E5KB]. 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
plaintiffs sought return of their investments, appointment of a 
commissioner to operate the entities, and an award of damages. After the motions to expunge lis pendens  were filed, the 
plaintiffs amended their complaints to allege "settlement of property titles." But none of the plaintiffs claimed title to, or sought to possess, any real property. Rather, they sought to "resettle all the titles of the real properties involved in the Defendants' EB-5 operations" among the various entity defendants. Under these circumstances the circuit court did not abuse its discretion by granting the defendants' motions to expunge the lis 
pendens. 
For these reasons, the March 16, 2020 Order[s] Granting 
Defendants' Motion[s] to Expunge Lis Pendens are affirmed. The plaintiffs' appeal from the March 16, 2020 Order[s] Granting [Defendants'] Motion[s] to Dismiss and/or Strike Duplicative Actions is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
