APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 1CC151001045) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL 
(By:  Chan, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that: 
(1) On March 20, 2020, self-represented Defendants-
Appellants Arthur Emil Galang, Norivic V. Galang, and Norma 
Pascual Rodil filed the notice of appeal electronically through 
Arthur Emil Galang, a registered Judiciary Electronic Filing 
System (JEFS) User. But Norivic V. Galang and Norma Pascual 
Rodil are not registered JEFS Users and the notice of appeal does 
not contain their handwritten signatures, consistent with Hawai# i NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Electronic Filing & Service Rules Rule 5.3. Thus, the notice of 
appeal is invalid as to Norivic V. Galang and Norma Pascual 
Rodil; 
(2) The opening brief was due on a clerk's extension on 
or before July 15, 2020; 
(3) Arthur Emil Galang failed to file the opening brief 
or request a second extension of time; 
(4) On July 22, 2020, the appellate clerk notified 
Arthur Emil Galang that the time for filing the opening brief had 
expired, the matter would be called to the court's attention on 
August 3, 2020, for appropriate action, which could include 
dismissal of the appeal, under Hawai# i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure Rule 30, and Arthur Emil Galang could request relief from default by motion; and 
(5) Arthur Emil Galang took no further action in this 
appeal. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed.

1 Even if the notice of appeal was valid as to Norivic V. Galang and
Norma Pascual Rodil, we note they also failed to file the opening brief, the
appellate clerk notified them about the default on July 22, 2020, and theyalso failed to take any further action in the appeal. Thus, dismissal oftheir appeal, if valid, would also be warranted for failure to file theopening brief.
