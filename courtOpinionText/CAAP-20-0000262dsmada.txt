IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
CHRIS GRINDLING, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Respondent-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
(CASE NO. 2CPN-19-0000002) 
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record here in CAAP-20-0000262 and 
in the underlying case, 2CPN-19-0000002,1 it appears that: 
(1)
 On December 16, 2019, self-represented Petitioner-
Appellant Chris Grindling (Grindling) filed in the underlying 
case a petition for post-conviction relief, under Hawai# i Rules 
of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40; 
(2)
 On December 24, 2019, the circuit court clerk 
electronically filed the petition to create the underlying case. That same day, the circuit court, among other things, granted 
Grindling's "request to proceed in forma pauperis [(IFP)] for 
purposes of this HRPP Rule 40 petition only;" 
(3) On March 6, 2020, the circuit court dismissed 
Grindling's HRPP Rule 40 petition as moot; 
(4)
 On April 2, 2020, Grindling filed the notice of 
appeal without the fees required by Hawai# i Rules of Appellate 
1 The court takes judicial notice of the records filed in the
underlying case. Hawai #i Rules of Evidence Rule 201. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 3(a). That same day, the circuit court 
clerk notified Grindling to pay the filing fees or file a motion 
to proceed IFP on or before April 15, 2020, or the appeal could 
be dismissed; 
(5) On April 24, 2020, Grindling filed in the 
underlying case a request to proceed IFP. That same day, the 
circuit court entered a written order denying the request, which 
effectively revoked Grindling's IFP status. See HRAP 
Rule 24(b);2 
(6) On June 4, 2020, the appellate clerk entered a 
default of the record on appeal, informing Grindling that the time to docket the appeal expired on June 1, 2020, he had not 
paid the filing fees or obtained an order allowing him to proceed 
on appeal IFP, the matter would be brought to the court's 
attention on June 15, 2020, for action that may include dismissal 
of the appeal, and he could seek relief from default by motion; 
(7) Grindling took no further action in this appeal; 
and 
(8) An appeal may be dismissed where the record on 
appeal has not been prepared because the appellant failed to pay 
the required fees or obtain an order allowing the appellant to 
proceed IFP. HRAP Rule 11(b)(2), (c)(2).

2 HRAP Rule 24(b) states, in relevant part, that a party granted leave
to proceed IFP in the underlying case 
may proceed on appeal in the same action in forma pauperis
without further authorization, unless, before or after thenotice of appeal is filed, the court . . . shall find thatthe party is otherwise not entitled to so proceed, in whichevent the court . . . shall state in writing the reasons forsuch . . . finding. 
3 This case is distinguishable from the Hawai #i Supreme Court's recent
decision in 
Estate Admin. Servs. LLC v. Mohulamu, No. SCWC-19- 0000050, 2020
WL 3397755, at *5-*7 (Haw. June 19, 2020) (holding that "under thecircumstances of this case, with Tigilau being a self-represented defendant,and because she submitted sufficient financial information, the ICA shouldhave addressed her IFP motions without requiring her to file a motion indistrict court"). Here, Grindling did not request a fee waiver from thiscourt. In addition, Grindling was the petitioner and not the defendant, thecircuit court revoked Grindling's IFP status because Grindling is "well known"to the circuit court, and the circuit court documented incidents demonstrating

its familiarity with Grindling's financial situation and apparent ability to
pay filing fees. See id. at *6 (holding HRAP Rule 24(a)'s requirement "that
an IFP motion shall ordinarily be made in the first instance to the courtappealed from contemplates that the appellant was a party who was required topay some costs below. That party is usually the plaintiff. At minimum, thestructure of the rule contemplates that the court being appealed from wouldhave greater information than the appellate court as to an appealing party'sability to pay filing fees.").
