SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and Nakasone, JJ.)  
This is an appeal from a foreclosure case. 
Defendant -Appellant Gwen Alejo -Herring ( Alejo-Herring) 
appeals from: (1) the "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and 
Order Granting [Plaintiff -Appellee Bank of America, N.A. 
(BOA)]'s Motion for Summary Judgment Against All Defendants and 
for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure " (Foreclosure Decree );

and (2) "Judgment, " both filed and entered on March 6, 2020 by 
the Circuit Court of the First Circuit ( Circuit Court ).1 
On appeal, Alejo -Herring contends that the Circuit 
Court erred in granting BOA's "Motion for Summary Judgment and 
For Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure " (MSJ), because BOA 
"failed to meet its prima facie burden of establishing its 
standing through admissible evidence." 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the argument advanced and the issues raised, we resolve Alejo -
Herring's point of error as follows, and vacate and remand. 
On December 5, 2017, BOA filed a foreclosure complaint 
against Alejo -Herring. On September 4, 2019, BOA filed its MSJ 
with a declaration by Elizabeth Ruiz ( Ruiz Declaration ), an 
authorized signer for BOA's loan servicer, Reverse Mortgage 
Solutions, Inc. ( RMS), to authenticate the attached adjustable 
rate note ( Note) and mortgage ( Mortgage ). Alejo-Herring opposed 
the MSJ, arguing, inter alia, that BOA " has not produced any 
admissible evidence establishing its right to enforce the 
agreement at the time the complaint was filed." The Circuit 
Court granted the MSJ on December 16, 2019, and o n March 6, 
2020, the Circuit Court filed the Foreclosure Decree and 
Judgment. This appeal followed. 
Alejo-Herring argues , inter alia, that BOA failed to 
establish its standing to foreclose by presenting the testimony 
of a qualified witness who could authenticate the Note and 
Mortgage under the incorporated records exception to the hearsay 
rule, set forth in U.S. Bank Trust, N.A. as Tr. for LSF9 Master 
Participation Tr. v. Verhagen , 149 Hawaii
 315, 489 P.3d 419 
(2021), and Deutsche Bank Nat'l Tr. Co. as Tr. for Morgan

Stanley ABS Cap.  I Inc. Tr. 2006-NC4 v. Yata, 152 Hawaii 322, 
526 P.3d 299 (2023).   Alejo-Herring argues that in the 
declaration, Ruiz "did not attest[] to being familiar with the 
record-keeping systems of either [the prior servicer]  or BOA, 
nor did [Ruiz] explain how the aforesaid documents were created in the normal course of [the prior servicer]'s business."   
  "[W]hen an entity incorporates records prepared by 
another entity into its own records, they are admissible  as 
business records of the incorporating entity  provided that it 
relies on the records, there are other indicia of reliability, 
and the requirements of  [Hawaiʻi Rules of Evidence ( HRE)]  Rule 
803(b)(6)  are otherwise satisfied."   Verhagen, 149 Hawai ʻi at 
325, 489  P.3d at 429 (cleaned up).  
Incorporated records are admissible under  HRE Rule 
803(b)(6)  when a custodian or qualified witness testifies 
that [1] the documents were incorporated and kept in the 
normal course of business, [2] that the  incorporating 
business typically relies upon the accuracy of the contents 
of the documents, and [3] the circumstances otherwise 
indicate the trustworthiness of the document  [(Condition 
No.3)].  
Id. at 325-26, 489 P.3d at 429 -30 (first three brackets in 
original) (citation omitted). "If each of these three 
conditions is satisfied, an incorporated record is 
admissible even in the absence of testimony concerning 
its actual creation. " Id. at 326, 489 P.3d at 430. 
To meet Verhagen Condition No.3 , testimony that 
establishes the trustworthiness of the incorporated records 
should describe "pre -incorporation vetting" by the current 
servicer, to ensure that the records of the prior servicer were 
not "uncritically incorporated" into the current service r's 
records. Id. at 326, 489 P.3d at 430. The Verhagen court found 
the following testimony sufficient to meet Condition No.3 : 
validating records using methods such as engaging in a due 
3  
 
 
    
 
 
  
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST 'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
diligence phase; reviewing hard copies; and reviewing payment 
history and accounting associated with the loan. Id.   In Yata, 
however, the supreme court found  the submitted testimony 
insufficient to meet Condition No.3, explaining that such testimony should describe "specific  methods of validation of 
documents from the prior loan servicer" and not "merely assert that [current servicer] has 'quality control and verification 
procedures' to ensure the accuracy of incorporated records 
without stating what those  procedures are." 152 
Hawaii at 335, 
526 P.3d at 312 (emphasis added).  
Here, the Ruiz Declaration stated : 
 25. Before the Prior Servicer's records were 
incorporated into RMS' own business records, it conducted 
an independent check into the Prior Servicer's records  and 
found them in keeping with industry  [sic]  wide loan 
servicing standards  and only integrated them into RMS's own 
business records after finding the Prior Servicer's records were made as part of a regularly conducted activity, met industry standards and determined to be trustworthy .  
 . . . . 
29. RMS did review and determine the Prior Servicer's 
business records were trustworthy otherwise it would not 
have incorporated it into its own records. 
(Emphases added.) Unlike Verhagen  and similar  to Yata, the Ruiz 
Declaration "merely assert[ed]" that RMS did an independent 
check and review of the records and found the records to be 
trustworthy.   See  Yata, 152 Hawaiʻi at 335, 526 P.3d at 312.   The 
Ruiz Declaration did  not describe "specific methods of 
validation"  and verification of RMS's or the prior servicer's  
records. See  id.; Verhagen, 149 Hawaii at 326, 489 P.3d at 430. 
Thus, the Ruiz Declaration did not satisfy  the trustworthiness 
requirement of Condition No.3, and the Circuit Court erred in 
admitting the Note and Mortgage  into evidence. See  Yata, 152 
Hawaii at 335, 526 P.3d at 312 (concluding that the business 
4  
 
 
   
 
  
 
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST 'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
records attached to the declarations  at issue  were inadmissible 
because the  declarations  did not meet Condition No.3).   We 
conclude the Circuit Court erred in granting summary judgment in 
favor of BOA. See  U.S. Bank N.A. v. Mattos, 140 Hawaii 26, 30, 
398 P.3d 615, 619 (2017)  ("An award of summary judgment is 
reviewed de novo and 'is appropriate where there is no genuine 
issue as to the material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.'" (citation omitted)).  
In light of our disposition, we need not reach Alejo -
Herring's remaining arguments. 
  For the foregoing reasons, we vacate and remand  the  
(1) the "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment Against All Defendants 
and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure"; and (2) 
"Judgment,"  both filed and entered on March 6, 2020 by the 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit.
