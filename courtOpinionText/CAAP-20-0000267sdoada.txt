In this joint appeal, Petitioners-Appellants Hannah 
Harrison (Harrison) and Hannah Metsch (Metsch) (collectively,
Appellants) appeal from the March 3, 2020 "Order Affirming 
Insurance Commissioners' Orders filed August 8, 2019"(Order

1 Pursuant to Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure ( HRAP ) Rule
43(c)(1), Gordon I. Ito, the current Insurance Commissioner, Department of
Commerce and Consumer Affairs, is automatically substituted asAppellee/Appellee herein in place of Colin M. Hayashida. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(Judgment) filed and entered by the Circuit Court of the First 
Circuit (Circuit Court).2 
On appeal, Appellants contend that the Circuit Court 
erroneously affirmed the determination of Respondent-Appellee 
Insurance Commissioner Gordon I. Ito, Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, State of Hawai# i (Commissioner) that Appellants 
were not entitled to prejudgment interest in connection with an insurance external review involving their managed care plan, Respondent-Appellee UnitedHealthcare Insurance Company dba Evercare (Evercare).
3 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve Appellants' points of error as follows, and affirm. 
The underlying case arises out of external reviews 
under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 432E-6(a) (2005) (repealed 
2011),
4 requested by both Appellants in 2011, of Evercare's 
decision regarding changes to coverage under their managed care 
plan with Evercare. Following the resolution of the external reviews, Appellants filed separate motions for attorneys' fees and costs in 2011 that were denied by the Commissioner in 2013; the denials were appealed to the Circuit Court in 2013; the case was then stayed by agreement from 2013-2017; then remanded back 
2 The Honorable James H. Ashford presided. 
3 Evercare now operates as UnitedHealthcare Insurance Company, Inc. 
4 HRS Chapter 432E, entitled the "Patients' Bill of Rights and
Responsibilities Act," sets forth statutory requirements for managed care
plans, and includes an external review procedure by which the enrollee maypursue a complaint against the managed care plan, in HRS § 432E-6. "'External review' means an administrative review requested by an enrollee under 432E-6of a managed care plan's final internal determination of an enrollee'scomplaint." HRS § 432E-1 (2005). 
The external review statute, HRS § 432E-6, was repealed by the
2011 Legislature, to comply with the federal Patient Protection and AffordableCare Act of 2010. See Haw. Med. Serv. Ass'n v. Adams, No. CAAP-10-0000011,
2013 WL 4606314, at *1 n.2 (App. Aug. 29, 2013) (SDO); 2011 Haw. Sess. LawsAct 230, § 10 at 746.

to the Commissioner by the Circuit Court in 2018,5 at which time 
the Commissioner awarded Harrison $22,320.19 in attorney's fees 
and costs, and Metsch $17,574.60 and $12,595.13 on two motions for attorneys' fees and costs. 
On August 3, 2018, Appellants filed motions for 
prejudgment interest (Motions for Prejudgment Interest), arguing 
that the Commissioner could award prejudgment interest 
pursuant to HRS § 432E-6(e)
6 and HRS § 636-16.7 
On August 8, 2019, the Commissioner denied Appellants' 
Motions for Prejudgment Interest (Orders Denying PJI), on the 
grounds that neither HRS § 636-16 nor HRS § 432E-6(e) 
"indicate[s] express authority or an obligation for the Commissioner to make a prejudgment interest award." 
Following a 2019 joint appeal to the Circuit Court, and 
a hearing on February 21, 2020,
8 the Circuit Court affirmed the 
Commissioner's Orders Denying PJI in a March 3, 2020 Order Affirming Commissioner, which concluded: 
5 The Honorable Keith K. Hiraoka presiding. 
6 The external review statute contains an attorney's fees and costs
provision, HRS § 432E-6(e) (2005) (repealed 2011), that provides: 
[a]n enrollee may be allowed, at the commissioner's
discretion, an award of a reasonable sum forattorney's fees and reasonable costs incurred inconnection with the external review under this section, unless the commissioner in an administrativeproceeding determines that the appeal wasunreasonable, fraudulent, excessive, or frivolous. 
7 HRS § 636-16 (1979) provides, 
In awarding interest in civil cases, the judge is
authorized to designate the commencement date to conformwith the circumstances of each case, provided that theearliest commencement date in cases arising in tort, may bethe date when the injury first occurred and in cases arisingby breach of contract, it may be the date when the breachfirst occurred. 
8 Appellants did not request transcripts of the February 21, 2020
hearing.

2. Pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes § 432E-6(e),
the Insurance Commissioner is neither expressly or impliedly
authorized to award prejudgment interest on the attorney feeawards. 
3. Hawaii Revised Statutes § 636-16 is inapplicable in
this case. The statute applies to the award of prejudgmentinterest in civil court actions. The statute does not applyto proceedings before the Insurance Commissioner and theDepartment of Commerce and Consumer Affairs under HawaiiRevised Statutes § 432E-6(e). 
Appellants raise their points of error (POE)9 as 
follows: 
II. CONCISE STATEMENT OF THE POINTS OF ERROR 
Whether the circuit court erred in affirming Commr
[sic] Hayashida's orders denying the Harrison PJI Motion,
Dkt #11, JIMS #4, 3-19 and the Metsch PJI Motion Dkt #11,JIMS #4 at 108-122 by: 
1. Narrowly construing Chapter 432E at odds withthe express remedial purposes for its enactmentto reach the result that the Insurance Commissioner is neither expressly nor impliedlyauthorized to award prejudgment interest onH.R.S. § 432E-6(e) attorney fee awards, Dkt #16at 3; 
2. Failing to provide a basis for its conclusionthat H.R.S. §636-16 "does not apply toproceedings before the Insurance Commissionerunder . . . H.R.S. § 432E-6(e)", Dkt #16 at 3;and 
3. Failing to adhere to rules of statutoryinterpretation in construing the applicabilityof H.R.S. § 636-16 based upon its language, thecommon law of prejudgment interest, and thelegislative history of 1979 Haw. Sess. Laws Act78." Dkt #16 at 3. 
9 Evercare argues that none of Appellants' points of error comply
with HRAP Rule 28(b)(4): 
Nor do any of Appellants' points of error contain referencesto "where in the record the alleged error was objected to orthe manner in which the alleged error was brought to theattention of the court or agency" as required by HRAP Rule28(b)(4); all references are to "Dkt #16 at 3," which is theorder appealed from.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRAP Rule 28(b)(4)(iii) provides that each point "shall 
state . . . the manner in which the alleged error was brought to 
the attention of the court or agency." This is a secondary appeal from the Circuit Court. The record references in the POE section above reference the motions for prejudgment interest filed before the Commissioner.
10 Each of the numbered POEs 
identically refers to "Dkt #16 at 3," which is the Order Affirming Commissioner that is the subject of this appeal, in accordance with HRAP Rule 28(b)(4)(i) and (ii). However, each numbered POE contains no record reference to where each argument raised in each POE was "brought to the attention" of the Circuit Court as required by HRAP Rule 28(b)(4)(iii). 
Notwithstanding the deficiencies in the Appellants' 
opening brief, we seek to address the merits where possible. See 
Schefke v. Reliable Collection Agency, Ltd., 96 Hawai# i 408, 420, 
32 P.3d 52, 64 (2001). With regard to POE 1, based on a plain reading of HRS § 432E-6(e), we conclude the Circuit Court was correct in affirming the Commissioner's denial of prejudgment interest because such an award is not authorized under the statute. 
Evercare argues that the specific arguments in POEs 2 
and 3 regarding HRS § 636-16 are waived because they were not argued before the Circuit 
Court.11 In addition to a noncompliant 
points of error section, the argument section also does not contain any citations to the record for arguments Appellants purportedly made before the Circuit Court regarding their 
10 The record references to "Harrison PJI Motion, Dkt #11, JIMS #4,
3-19" and "Metsch PJI Motion[,] Dkt. #11, JIMS #4 at 108-122" pertain to the
prejudgment interest motions filed before the Commissioner. 
11 Evercare argues: "Appellants failed to raise before the circuit
court any of their arguments regarding statutory interpretation of HRS § 636-
16, the common law of prejudgment interest, or the legislative history of 1979Haw. Sess. Laws Act 78."  Appellants did not file a Reply Brief to Evercare'sAnswering Brief.

entitlement to prejudgment interest.12 See HRAP Rule 28(b)(7) 
(requiring that argument on the points presented contain 
citations to the "parts of the record relied on."); State v. Hoglund, 71 Haw. 147, 150-51, 785 P.2d 1311, 1313 (1990) (citation omitted) ("Generally, the failure to properly raise an issue at the trial level precludes a party from raising that issue on appeal."). 
"[A]ppellant has the burden of furnishing the appellate 
court with a sufficient record to positively show the alleged error." Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai# i 225, 230, 909 
P.2d 553, 558 (1995) (quoting Union Building Materials Corp. v. The Kakaako Corp., 5 Haw. App. 146, 151, 682 P.2d 82, 87 (1984)). The Appellants' POEs challenge various aspects of the Circuit Court's reasoning in arriving at its conclusions, yet provide no transcript of the hearing before the Circuit Court. See HRAP 
Rule 10(b)(1)(A) (requiring transcripts for "any point on appeal that requires consideration of the oral proceedings before the court appealed from . . . ."). "The burden is upon appellant in an appeal to show error by reference to matters in the record, and he [or she] has the responsibility of providing an adequate transcript." Bettencourt, 80 Hawai# i at 230, 909 P.2d at 558. 
Without a transcript there is no basis upon which to review the alleged errors in the Circuit Court's reasoning in arriving at its conclusion. 
An appellate court is not "obligated to sift through 
the voluminous record to verify an appellant's inadequately documented contentions[.]" Haw. Ventures, LLC v. Otaka, Inc., 
114 Hawai# i 438, 480, 164 P.3d 696, 738 (2007) (citations and 
internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, as to POEs 2 and 3, we conclude they are waived, and alternatively, Appellants have 
12 The argument section contains a single record reference to "Dkt
#11, JIMS #4 at 71, 190," which are the Commissioner's 2013 orders denying
attorneys' fees and costs for Appellants. This reference is to the record before the Commissioner, not the appeal to the Circuit Court.

10(b)(1)(A); Bettencourt, 80 Hawai# i at 230, 909 P.2d at 558; 
Hoglund, 71 Haw. at 150-51, 785 P.2d at 1313. 
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the March 3, 2020 
"Order Affirming Insurance Commissioners' Orders filed August 8, 
2019" and the March 17, 2020 Final Judgment filed and entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit.
