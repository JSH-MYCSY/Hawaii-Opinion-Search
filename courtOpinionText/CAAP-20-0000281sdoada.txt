PPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(WAI# ANAE DIVISION)
(CASE NO. 1DTA-19-02953) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Christopher Delano Almli (Almli) 
appeals from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and 
Plea/Judgment entered on March 13, 2020 (
Judgment), in the 
District Court of the First Circuit, Wai# anae Division (District 
Court
). 1/
On September 17, 2019, Almli was charged by Complaint 
with Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant 
The Honorable Sherri-Ann Iha presided. 1/  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(OVUII) in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 291E-
61(a)(1) and/or (a)(4) (Supp. 2019).   On March 13, 2020, the 
District Court dismissed the Complaint without prejudice "based 
on the fact that [the Honolulu Police Department] has not complied with what [discovery] was requested and the State is not ready to proceed today."  The District Court stated, "I'm going to dismiss it without prejudice because the case should be heard on its merits," without any further explanation. 2/
On appeal, Almli raises a single point of error, 
contending that the District Court erred in dismissing the case without prejudice or, at the very least, the case should be vacated and remanded for findings in support of dismissing with or without prejudice.  Although the State argues that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the case without prejudice, the State acknowledges that perhaps the District Court did not sufficiently articulate the

factors and any other factors it considered in rendering its 
decision to dismiss without prejudice. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve Almli's point of error as follows: 
"In criminal cases, 'the power of a court to dismiss a 
case on its own motion for failure to prosecute with due diligence is inherent.'"  State v. Mageo
, 78 Hawai# i 33, 37, 889 
P.2d 1092, 1096 (App. 1995) (emphasis and brackets omitted) (quoting 
Estencion, 63 Haw. at 268, 625 P.2d at 1043).  A trial 
court has the inherent power to dismiss a charge with or without prejudice, but must clearly articulate the reasons for its decision so that a reviewing court may accurately assess whether the trial court duly exercised its discretion.  See id. at 37-38, 889 P.2d at 1096-97 (trial courts exercising their inherent power to dismiss a criminal case with prejudice should set forth their reasons for doing so); see also State v. Hern
, 133 Hawai# i 59, 
64, 323 P.3d 1241, 1246 (App. 2013) (in determining whether to dismiss a charge with or without prejudice under Hawai# i Rules of 
Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 48(b), the trial court must "clearly 
articulate the effect of the . . . factors [set forth in 
Estencion
, 63 Haw. at 269, 625 P.2d at 1044] and any other factor 
it considered in rendering its decision").  When issuing its 
findings, the trial court should consider the appropriate factors

depending upon the grounds for dismissal.  Compare Mageo , 78 
Hawai# i at 37-38, 889 P.2d at 1096-97 (dismissal with or without 
prejudice for want of prosecution requires "balancing of the 
interest of the state against fundamental fairness to a defendant with the added ingredient of the orderly functioning of the court system" (quoting 
State v. Moriwake, 65 Haw. 47, 56, 647 P.2d 705, 
712 (1982)) (bracket omitted)), with Estencion, 63 Haw. at 269, 625 P.2d at 1044 (dismissal with or without prejudice for violation of HRPP Rule 48 requires consideration of:  "the seriousness of the offense; the facts and the circumstances of the case which led to the dismissal; and the impact of a reprosecution on the administration of this chapter and on the administration of justice."). 
Here, the District Court did not provide any 
explanation for its decision to dismiss the charge without prejudice, except to say that the case should be heard on the merits, which is devoid of an explanation or findings consistent with applicable case law.  We conclude that the record in this case is inadequate for this court to meaningfully review whether the District Court properly exercised its discretion in dismissing Almli's OVUII charge without prejudice. 
Therefore, the District Court's March 13, 2020 Judgment 
is vacated, and this case is remanded to the District Court to make findings that articulate the factors considered in rendering

its decision to dismiss with or without prejudice and the effect 
of those factors in this case.
