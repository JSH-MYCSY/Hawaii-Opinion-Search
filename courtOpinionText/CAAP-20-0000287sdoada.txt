APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 1CC191001594) 
  
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Wadsworth and McCullen, JJ.) 
Plaintiff-Appellant Jacques Bartholomew Garrett 
(
Garrett) appeals from the Circuit Court of the First Circuit's1 
March 18, 2020 Order Granting Defendant-Appellee Association of 
Apartment Owners of Terrazza/Cortebella/Las Brisas/Tiburon's 
(Association) Motion to Dismiss Complaint (Order) and March 18, 
2020 Final Judgment (Judgment). 
1 The Honorable Dean E. Ochiai presided.   
 
   Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the issues raised and the arguments advanced by the parties, we 
resolve Garrett's arguments as discussed below. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In his sole point of error, Garrett contends the 
circuit court erred in dismissing his complaint because Act 
282's (2019) amendment to Hawai
‘i Revised Statutes (HRS) 
chapter 667 did not obviate the requirement for a power of sale 
provision in Association's bylaws or other enforceable agreement 
to conduct a nonjudicial foreclosure on his unit. 
"A complaint should not be dismissed for failure to 
state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of their claim that would 
entitle them to relief." Malabe v. Ass'n of Apartment Owners of
Exec. Ctr. by & through Bd. of Dirs.
, 147 Hawaiʻi 330, 338, 465 
P.3d 777, 785 (2020) (cleaned up). We view the complaint in the 
light most favorable to the plaintiff "to determine whether the 
allegations contained therein could warrant relief under any 
alternative theory" and "our consideration is strictly limited 
to the allegations of the complaint, and we must deem those 
allegations to be true." Id.
 (citation omitted). 
In his complaint, Garrett asserted that "[a]ccording 
to the Affidavit, [Association] claims to have complied with [HRS] Chapter 667, Chapter 514A and 514[B], and the By-Laws[.]"

Garrett then asserted Association's "governing bylaws lacked a 
power of sale as required to conduct a nonjudicial foreclosure 
in the State of [Hawai‘ i]" and Association's "actions constitute 
wrongful foreclosure, which foreclosure resulted in damages to" 
him. 
In its Order, the circuit court concluded, based on 
Act 282, "Association was not required to have a power of sale 
provision in [its] governing documents to conduct a nonjudicial 
power of sale foreclosure, and the Association therefore had the 
statutory authority to conduct the nonjudicial foreclosure of 
the Property." 
However, as the Hawai‘ i Supreme Court explained, 
Act 282 does not affect a wrongful foreclosure claim under HRS 
chapter 667, Part I. See Malabe, 147 Hawaiʻ i at 333, 356, 465 
P.3d at 780, 803. 
To the extent the circuit court relied on Act 282 in 
determining Association was not required to have a power of sale 
provision in its governing documents to conduct a nonjudicial foreclosure sale, it erred in dismissing Garrett's wrongful 
foreclosure claim. See Collins v. Ass'n of Apartment Owners of
Kemoo by the Lake, CAAP-18-0000850, 2024 WL 3205278, at *3 (Haw. App. June 27, 2024); Sakal v. Ass'n of Apartment Owners of 
Hawaiian Monarch
, 148 Hawai‘i 1, 9 n.13, 466 P.3d 399, 407 n.13 
(2020) (stating per 
Malabe, AOAO was not permitted to foreclose 
3   
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
on property without power of sale provision in its bylaws or 
other enforceable agreement). 
Because the circuit court concluded Garrett's 
remaining causes of action relied on a lack of power of sale in 
Association's governing documents, i.e. the basis of Garrett's 
wrongful foreclosure claim, it erred in dismissing Garrett's 
remaining claims with prejudice. 
For these reasons, we vacate the March 18, 2020 Order 
and the March 18, 2020 Judgment, and remand this case to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this 
summary disposition order.
