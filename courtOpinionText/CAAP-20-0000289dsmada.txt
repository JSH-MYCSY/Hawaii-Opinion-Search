APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 2CC191000234(3)) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
appellate jurisdiction over this appeal by Plaintiffs-Appellees 
David Abel, Kristin Abel, Lin G. Eldridge, Individually and as 
Trustee of the Linden Geary Eldridge Trust Dated October 30, 
1997, Stacie Ray Ferreira, Richard R. Green, Gregg C. Inokuma, 
Isaac K. Lui, Tracy N. Lui, and Jennifer L. Polich (the 
Plaintiffs) from the Honorable Kelsey T. Kawano's March 24, 2020 
amended interlocutory order granting in part and denying in part  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Defendant/Cross-Claim Defendant/Appellee Bank of America, N.A. 
(Bank of America) and Defendant-Appellee Mortgage Electronic 
Registration Systems, Inc.'s motion to partially dismiss the 
Plaintiffs' July 18, 2019 complaint and sever their claims, 
because the circuit court has neither resolved all of the 
multiple claims in this case nor reduced its dispositive rulings 
to an appealable final judgment. 
An aggrieved party cannot obtain appellate review of a 
circuit court's dispositive orders in a civil case pursuant to 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a)(2016) until the circuit 
court reduces the dispositive rulings to an appealable final 
judgment pursuant to Rules 58 or 54(b) of the Hawai# i Rules of 
Civil Procedure (HRCP).  
See Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & 
Wright
, 76 Hawai# i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994).  The 
circuit court has not yet adjudicated and entered a judgment on all of the multiple claims asserted in: 
• the Plaintiffs' July 18, 2019 complaint, 
• Defendants/Cross-Claim Plaintiffs/Third-Party
Plaintiffs/Appellees Brian Wiwchar and BarbaraWiwchar's (the Wiwchars) October 17, 2019 cross-claim, 
• the Wiwchars' October 17, 2019 third-partycomplaint, 
• Defendants/Cross-Claim Plaintiffs/AppelleesTimothy A. Stewart, II, and Sanoe M.K. Awai's October 23, 2019 cross-claim, 
• Defendants/Cross-Claim Plaintiffs/Third-PartyPlaintiffs/Appellees James Woessner and HirokoWoessner's (the Woessners) October 29, 2019 cross-claim, and 
• the Woessners' October 29, 2019 third-partycomplaint. 
In addition, the circuit court did not enter a final judgment 
pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b).  
See Oppenheimer v. AIG Hawaii Ins. 
Co.
, 77 Hawai# i 88, 93, 881 P.2d 1234, 1239 (1994);

2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Nevertheless, the Plaintiffs assert in their June 8, 
2020 statement of jurisdiction that the March 24, 2020 amended 
interlocutory order is immediately appealable under the 
collateral order doctrine and the Forgay doctrine.  However, our 
review of the record and relevant case law reveals that the 
March 24, 2020 amended interlocutory order does not satisfy the 
multiple requirements for appealability under the collateral 
order doctrine or the Forgay doctrine.  See Greer v. Baker
, 137 
Hawai# i 249, 253, 369 P.3d 832, 836 (2016) (reciting the 
requirements for appeals under the collateral order doctrine and 
the 
Forgay doctrine); Hofmann v. De Marchena Kaluche & Asociados, 
642 F.3d 995, 998 (11th Cir. 2011) (holding that the collateral order doctrine does not provide appellate jurisdiction for a 
severance order issued under Rule 21 of the Federal Rules of 
Civil Procedure); cf. In re Lieb, 915 F.2d 180, 182–185 (5th Cir. 
1990) (holding that a district court's order severing claims and 
directing that they continue as separate actions in bankruptcy 
court was not an appealable final order).  Absent an appealable 
final judgment, the Plaintiffs' appeal is premature and we lack 
appellate jurisdiction. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court 
case number CAAP-20-0000289 is dismissed for lack of appellate 
jurisdiction.
