APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 5CC191000070) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By:  Chan, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
appellate jurisdiction over this appeal by Plaintiffs-Appellants 
Kimberly M. Wallis, Jack E. McConnachie, Jr., Donna M. 
McConnachie, Zenaida Daligcon, Frances K. Foster, Kendall E. Goo, 
Laura L. Goo, and Cynthia J. Green (the Plaintiffs) from the 
Honorable Randal G.B. Valenciano's April 14, 2020 interlocutory 
order granting in part and denying in part Defendant/Cross-Claim 
Defendant/Appellee Bank of America, N.A. (Bank of America), and  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Defendant-Appellee Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, 
Inc.'s motion to partially dismiss the Plaintiffs' June 24, 2019 
first amended complaint and sever the Plaintiffs' claims, because 
the circuit court has neither resolved all of the multiple claims 
in this case nor reduced its dispositive rulings to an appealable 
final judgment. 
An aggrieved party cannot obtain appellate review of a 
circuit court's dispositive orders in a civil case pursuant to 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a)(2016) until the circuit 
court has reduced the dispositive rulings to an appealable final 
judgment pursuant to Rules 58 or 54(b) of the Hawai# i Rules of 
Civil Procedure (HRCP). See Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & 
Wright
, 76 Hawai# i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). The 
circuit court has not yet entered a separate judgment on all of the parties' multiple claims asserted in: 
• the Plaintiffs' June 24, 2019 complaint, 
• Defendants/Cross-Claim Plaintiffs/Appellees Shawn
D.
 Cohen's and Roberta J. Cohen's October 7, 2019
cross-claim, 
• Defendants/Cross-Claim Plaintiffs/Appellees JasonE. Barber's and Allison M. Barber's October 16,2019 cross-claim, 
• Defendant/Cross-Claim Plaintiff/Appellee FinanceFactors, Limited's October 22, 2019 cross-claim, 
• Defendants/Cross-Claim Plaintiffs/AppelleesGregory S. Baxter's and Montana J. Knightsbridge'sOctober 24, 2019 cross-claim, and 
• Defendant/Cross-Claim Plaintiff/Appellee Tracie Y.Ibara's November 22, 2019 cross-claim. 
In addition, the circuit court did not enter a final judgment 
pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b). See Oppenheimer v. AIG Hawaii Ins. 
Co.
, 77 Hawai# i 88, 93, 881 P.2d 1234, 1239 (1994); 
Jenkins
, 76 
Hawai# i at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339. 
Nevertheless, the Plaintiffs assert in their July 7, 
2020 statement of jurisdiction that the April 14, 2020 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
interlocutory order is immediately appealable under the 
collateral order doctrine and the Forgay doctrine. However, our 
review of the record and relevant case law reveals that the 
April 14, 2020 interlocutory order does not satisfy the multiple 
requirements for appealability under the collateral order 
doctrine or the Forgay doctrine. See Greer v. Baker
, 137 Hawai# i 
249, 253, 369 P.3d 832, 836 (2016) (reciting the requirements for appeals under the collateral order doctrine and the 
Forgay 
doctrine); Hofmann v. De Marchena Kaluche & Asociados, 642 F.3d 995, 998 (11th Cir. 2011) (holding that the collateral 
order doctrine does not provide appellate jurisdiction for a 
severance order issued under Rule 21 of the Federal Rules of 
Civil Procedure); cf. In re Lieb, 915 F.2d 180, 182–185 (5th Cir. 
1990) (holding that a district court's order severing claims and 
directing that they continue as separate actions in bankruptcy 
court was not an appealable final order). Absent an appealable 
final judgment, the Plaintiffs' appeal is premature and we lack 
appellate jurisdiction. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court 
case number CAAP-20-0000298 is dismissed for lack of appellate 
jurisdiction.
