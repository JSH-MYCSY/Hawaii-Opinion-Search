(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
The County of Kaua #i, its Planning Department  and 
Planning Commission , and Donna Apisa, in her official capacity as 
Chair of the Commission,1 (collectively, the County) appeal, and 
Greg Allen, Jr. and Joanne B. Allen (the Allens) cross-appeal, 
from the Final Judgment  entered by the Circuit Court of the Fifth 
Circuit on April 1, 2020.2 The Final Judgment reversed the 
Commission's "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, [and]
Decision and Order " issued on February 7, 2019. For the reasons 
explained below, we vacate the Final Judgment, vacate the Decision and Order in part, and remand this case to the circuit

court for further proceedings consistent with this summary 
disposition order. 
The Allens own a single-family home (the Wailua River 
House) on the island of Kaua #i. On June 9, 2017, the Department 
issued the Allens a Zoning Compliance Notice . The Allens were 
told they were operating a transient vacation rental3 outside a 
Visitor Destination Area4 in violation of Kaua #i County Code 
(KCC) § 8-17.8(a) (1987). They were directed to stop using the 
property as a transient rental and to cancel all transient 
accommodation commitments for the property. 
On August 22, 2017, the Department issued the Allens a 
Notice of Violation & Order to Pay Fines . It determined that the 
Allens continued to illegally offer the Wailua River House as a transient vacation rental after they received the Zoning Compliance Notice. The Allens were fined $10,000 and ordered to correct their violation within 15 days, or face additional fines of $1,000 per day. 
The Allens appealed the Order to Pay Fines to the 
Commission. A hearings officer conducted a contested case hearing on October 15, 2018. The Department requested a fine of $130,000. The hearings officer's report and recommendation was filed with the Commission on January 3, 2019. 
The Commission issued the Decision and Order on 
February 7, 2019. The Commission found that the Allens had a state Transient Accommodation Tax License, but their property was not in a Visitor Destination Area and did not have a Nonconforming Use Certificate. The Commission concluded that the Allens received notice of their violation and that they would be

subject to civil fines for continued violations. The Commission 
affirmed the Zoning Compliance Notice and the Order to Pay Fines and imposed a fine of $130,000. 
The Allens appealed to the circuit court on March 8, 
2019. The circuit court entered "Amended Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, [and a] Decision and Order" on March 19, 2020. The court reversed the Commission's Decision and Order and vacated the Allens' fines. The Final Judgment was entered on April 1, 2020. This appeal by the County and cross-appeal by the Allens followed. 
The County's Appeal 
The County makes two arguments:
5 (1) the Commission's 
conclusion that the Allens unlawfully ran a transient vacation 
rental in violation of the Kaua #i Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance 
was supported by substantial evidence; and (2) the Commission's 
conclusion that the Allens' continuing violation supported the imposition of an initial $10,000 fine and $120,000 in additional fines was supported by substantial evidence. 
In this Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 91-14 secondary 
appeal, we review the Commission's decision to determine whether the circuit court was right or wrong to reverse the decision. Dao v. Zoning Bd. of Appeals
, 144 Hawai#i 28, 38, 434 P.3d 1223, 
1233 (App. 2019). The determinations at issue are mixed findings of fact and conclusions of law. We review mixed findings and conclusion under the clearly erroneous standard because they depend on the facts and circumstances of the case before the Commission. 
Id. at 39, 434 P.3d at 1234. 
A conclusion supported 
5 The County's statement of the points of error challenges a number
of the circuit court's findings of fact. A circuit court reviewing an
agency's decision and order in a contested case under Hawaii Revised Statutes§ 91-14 acts as an appellate court; it does not review the evidence in theagency record to make its own findings of fact. Sierra Club v. Bd. of Land & 
Nat. Res.

No. SCWC-22-0000516, 2024 WL 3378462 (July 11, 2024). We decline to review the circuit court's findings of fact and instead analyze the issues presentedby the County's arguments.

by the agency's findings of fact and applying the correct rule of 
law will not be overturned. See Est. of Klink ex rel. Klink v. 
State, 113 Hawai #i 332, 351, 152 P.3d 504, 523 (2007).
(1) The Kaua# i County Code provides: 
Single Family Transient Vacation Rentals . 
(a) . . . [S]ingle family transient vacation rentals are
prohibited in all areas not designated as Visitor
Destination Areas. 
KCC § 8-17.8 (1987). 
The KCC also provides: 
Enforcement Against Illegal Transient Vacation Rentals . 
. . . . 
(b) Advertising of any sort which offers a property as a
transient vacation rental shall constitute prima facie
evidence of the operation of a transient vacationrental on said property and the burden of proof shallbe on the owner, operator, or lessee to establish thatthe subject property is not being used as a transientvacation rental or that it is being used for suchpurpose legally. . . . 
KCC § 8-17.11 (1987). 
The Department presented evidence that the Allens owned 
the Wailua River House; the house was advertised as a per-night 
rental on VRBO.com and wailuariverhouse.com; and the house was located outside a mapped Visitor Destination Area. The Department also presented evidence that on August 2, 2017 (two months after the Zoning Compliance Notice was issued), the Allens offered to rent the Wailua River House to an undercover investigator for 8 days for $6,731.24, sending a rental agreement and a credit card authorization. The Allens presented no evidence that the Wailua River House was not being used as a transient vacation rental or that they had a Nonconforming Use Certificate. The record contains substantial evidence supporting the Commission's finding and conclusion that the Allens "have not overcome the [rebuttable] presumption that they operated the [Wailua River House] as a Transient Vacation Rental outside of a 
4  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Visitor Destination Area without a [Nonconforming Use 
Certificate.]" 
The Allens argue the Department did not submit a map 
showing the Visitor Destination Area to the hearings officer. But a Department enforcement inspector testified she reviewed the Department map and determined the Wailua River House was outside a Visitor Destination Area. The Allens offered no evidence to the contrary. 
The Allens cite Dao  and argue the Department did not 
present "evidence of an actual rental to a transient occupant." Dao
 involved the City and County of Honolulu's Land Use Ordinance 
(LUO). The LUO defined "transient vacation unit" as a dwelling 
unit "provided for compensation  to transient occupants for less 
than 30 days[.]" 144 Hawai#i at 29 n.1, 434 P.3d at 1224 n.1 
(emphasis added). In 
Dao, a City inspector testified that an 
unidentified man said he was renting Dao's property for three 
days. Id. at 30, 434 P.3d at 1225. We held the evidence was insufficient to establish an LUO violation because "[t]here are no details of a monetary transaction or other indicia of compensation or any other supporting details or evidence of any kind." Id. at 44, 434 P.3d at 1239. The Dao  opinion does not 
say whether the LUO contained an evidentiary presumption similar to KCC § 8-17.11(b). 
Here, the Department presented evidence sufficient to 
establish a prima facie presumption of a violation under KCC § 8-17.11(b). The burden then shifted to the Allens to show that the Wailua River House "is not being used as a transient vacation rental or that it is being used for such purpose legally." Id. 
The Allens presented no such evidence. Under these circumstances, the Commission's finding and conclusion that the Allens violated KCC § 8-17.8(a) was not clearly erroneous.
(2) 
The Kaua#i County Code provides: 
Enforcement, Legal Procedures and Penalties . 
. . . .

(b) Civil Fines. 
(1) If the Director of the Planning Department
determines that any person, firm or corporation
is not complying with a notice of violation, theDirector may have the party responsible for theviolation served . . . with an order pursuant tothis Section. The order may require the partyresponsible for the violation to do any or allof the following: (A) correct the violationwithin the time specified in the order; (B) paya civil fine not to exceed $10,000 in themanner, at the place, and before the datespecified in the order; (C) pay a civil fine up
to $10,000 per day for each day in which the
violation persists, in the manner and at the
time and place specified in the order. . . . 
KCC § 8-3.5 (1987) (emphasis added). 
The Kaua# i County Code also provides, in relevant part: 
Penalty. 
An owner of any unit which is operated in violation of thisArticle, and/or any other person, firm, company,association, partnership or corporation violating anyprovision of this Article, shall each be fined not less than$500 nor more than $10,000 for each offense. . . . If anyperson fails to cease such violation within one month, suchperson shall be subject to a new and separate violation foreach day the violation continues to exist. 
KCC § 8-17.6 (1987). 
The Zoning Compliance Notice told the Allens that they 
could be fined "up to $10,000.00 and/or up to $10,000.00 per day, 
should the violation(s) persist." The Order to Pay Fines imposed a civil fine of $10,000 and ordered the Allens to correct their violation within 15 days, or "[a]n additional fine of $1,000 per violation, per day, for each day in which such violation persists shall be levied." The Commission's conclusion affirming the $10,000 fine for the Allens' violation was supported by substantial evidence, consistent with KCC §§ 8-3.5 and 8-17.6, and not clearly erroneous. 
A week before the October 15, 2018 contested case 
hearing, the Department discovered the Allens were still advertising the Wailua River House as a transient vacation rental. According to the Department, the VRBO.com "website now 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
contains 12 separate visitor reviews indicating visitors that 
stayed in the Allen's [sic] property subsequent to them receiving the zoning compliance notice and cease and desist order." The Department asked that the $10,000 fine be increased "to $130,000 to encompass the continued violation." But the Order to Pay Fines, which imposed the $10,000 fine for the advertising violation, told the Allens that "[a]n additional fine of $1,000 
per violation, per day, for each day in which such violation persists shall be levied." (Emphasis added.) 
The record does not support a finding or conclusion 
that the additional $120,000 in fines was based on $1,000 per day for each day the Allens continued to advertise the Wailua River House transient vacation rental beginning 15 days after the Order to Pay Fines was served. Instead, the record indicates that the Department requested an additional $10,000 fine for each of the 12 visitor reviews. But the Department did not issue a zoning compliance notice or a notice of violation and order to pay fines for any of those 12 transient rentals. KCC § 8-3.5(b)(1). The Commission thus exceeded its statutory authority by imposing the additional $120,000 civil fine. HRS § 91–14(g)(2) (Supp. 2018). 
The Allens' Cross-Appeal 
The Allens argue that the 180-day period in the KCC's 
definitions of Transient  and 
Transient Vacation Rental  "is unduly 
burdensome and unreasonably restricts the free use of [their] property" and is "arbitrary and does not bear a reasonable relation to the public health, safety, morals or general welfare." They cite the 
Hawai#i Landlord-Tenant Code, which 
allows month-to-month rentals,6 and provisions in the Revised 
Ordinances of Honolulu7 and the Hawai#i County Code8 that specify 
6 HRS § 521-71 (2018). 
7 Revised Ordinances of Honolulu § 21-10.1 (1990 & Supp. No. 31).
The Revised Ordinances of Honolulu was amended effective November 18, 2022 to
specify 90-day periods for transient accommodations, occupants, and vacation
(continued...) 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
30-day periods for transient or short-term vacation rentals. 
They cite no provision in the Hawai #i Constitution or the United 
States Constitution. We nevertheless construe their argument as an attack on the County's police power. See Lum Yip Kee, Ltd. v. 
City & Cnty. of Honolulu , 70 Haw. 179, 190, 767 P.2d 815, 822 
(1989) (noting that "the power to zone is an exercise of the police power of a municipality"). 
The Allens made their argument to the Commission. The 
Commission made no finding or conclusion on the 180-day issue, nor could it have. See HOH Corp. v. Motor Vehicle Licensing Bd. , 
69 Haw. 135, 143, 736 P.2d 1271, 1276 (1987) ("The administrative agency is not empowered to pass on the validity of the statute . . . ."). The circuit court did not address the issue. Accordingly, we remand this case to the circuit court to decide whether the KCC's 180-day minimum rental period for single-family homes outside a Visitor Destination Area was a proper exercise of the County's police power. See id. at 143, 736 P.2d at 1276 (remanding to circuit court to determine constitutionality of regulatory statute). 
Disposition 
The circuit court's April 1, 2020 Final Judgment is 
vacated. The February 7, 2019 Decision and Order is affirmed to 
the extent it vacated the additional $120,000 fine. This case is remanded for the circuit court to decide whether the KCC's 180-day minimum rental period for single-family homes outside a Visitor Destination Area was a proper exercise of the County's police power. If the circuit court concludes it was, it should affirm the Commission's finding of a violation and imposition of the $10,000 fine; if the circuit court concludes it was not, it
