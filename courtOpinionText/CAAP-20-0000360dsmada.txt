NO. CAAP-20-0000360 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
EDWARD J. MARTIN, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Respondent-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 2PR181000012(4) (CR. NO. 2PC111000645(4))) 
ORDER 
DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
AND 
DISMISSING ALL PENDING MOTIONS AS MOOT 
(By: 
Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
jurisdiction over the appeal that Petitioner-Appellant Edward J. 
Martin (Martin) has asserted from the December 16, 2019 order, 
entered by the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit, denying 
Martin's petition for post-conviction relief pursuant to Rule 40 
of the Hawai# i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) in S.P.P. 
No. 2PR181000012. Martin's appeal is untimely under Rule 4(b) of the Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP). 
"[P]ursuant to HRAP Rule 4(b), an appeal from an order 
denying post-conviction relief must either be filed within thirty 
days after the entry of the order denying the HRPP Rule 40 
petition or, in the alternative, after the announcement but   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
before the entry of the order." Grattafiori v. State, 79 Hawai# i 
10, 13, 897 P.2d 937, 940 (1995). 
Although Martin has had a 
court-appointed attorney in the underlying proceeding in S.P.P. 
No. 2PR181000012,1 Martin tendered his notice of appeal to prison 
officials for mailing on February 6, 2020. The Supreme Court of 
Hawai# i has held that, when a self-represented prisoner attempts 
to assert an appeal, the "notice of appeal is deemed filed for purposes of Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 4(a) 
on the day it is tendered to prison officials by a pro se prisoner." 
Setala v. J.C. Penney Company
, 97 Hawai# i 484, 485, 
40 P.3d 886, 887 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). In the instant case, HRAP Rule 4(b) provides the controlling time 
period for filing a notice of appeal rather than HRAP Rule 4(a). 
Even if we use February 6, 2020, as the effective date of 
Martin's notice of appeal, Martin did not tender his February 6, 
2020 notice of appeal within thirty days after entry of the 
December 16, 2019 order denying Martin's HRPP Rule 40 petition 
for post-conviction relief. 
"As a general rule, compliance with the requirement of 
the timely filing of a notice of appeal is jurisdictional, . . . 
and we must dismiss an appeal on our motion if we lack 
jurisdiction." Grattafiori
, 79 Hawai# i at 13, 897 P.2d at 940 
(citations, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or justice is authorized to 
change the jurisdictional requirements contained in Rule 4 of 
these rules."); HRAP Rule 26(e) ("The reviewing court for good 
cause shown may relieve a party from a default occasioned by any 
failure to comply with these rules, except the failure to give 
timely notice of appeal."). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that CAAP-20-0000360 is 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
1 The exception for untimely appeals due to ineffective assistance of
counsel, in State v. Irvine
, 88 Hawai #i 404, 967 P.2d 236 (1998), is
inapplicable to this HRPP Rule 40 matter. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions 
in CAAP-20-0000360 are dismissed as moot. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, June 23, 2020.
