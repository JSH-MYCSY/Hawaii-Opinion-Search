APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 3CC171000164) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL 
(
By:  Chan, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that: 
(1) On May 1, 2020, self-represented Defendant-
Appellant Eugene George Warner (Warner) inadvertently filed the 
notice of appeal in an existing, related appeal in CAAP-19-
0000568, without paying the fees required by Hawai# i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 3(a); 
(2)
 On May 12, 2020, the appellate clerk refiled the 
May 1, 2020 notice of appeal to create this appeal in CAAP-20-
0000368. The same day, the appellate clerk filed a May 1, 2020 
letter to Warner, informing him that the May 1, 2020 notice of 
appeal was refiled in CAAP-20-0000368, and instructing him to pay 
the filing fees or file a request for a fee waiver;  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(3) On May 21, 2020, the appellate clerk filed a notice 
of non-payment, informing Warner that he had not paid the filing 
fees or filed a motion for leave to proceed on appeal in forma 
pauperis, and that failure to do either by June 1, 2020, could 
result in dismissal of the appeal; 
(4) On July 17, 2020, the appellate clerk entered a 
default of the record on appeal, informing Warner that the time 
to docket the appeal expired on June 30, 2020, he had not paid 
the filing fees, the record on appeal cannot be filed without 
payment of fees or an order allowing him to proceed on appeal in 
forma pauperis, the matter would be brought to the court's 
attention on July 27, 2020, for action that may include dismissal 
of the appeal, and he could seek relief from default by motion; 
(5) Warner took no further action in the appeal; and (6) An appeal may be dismissed where the record on 
appeal has not been prepared because the appellant failed to pay the required fees or obtain an order allowing the appellant to 
proceed in forma pauperis. HRAP Rule 11(b)(2), (c)(2). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, September 25, 2020.
