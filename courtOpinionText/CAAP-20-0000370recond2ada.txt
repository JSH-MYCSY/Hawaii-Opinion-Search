BRYAN SUITT, Petitioner-Appellant,
v. 
STATE OF HAWAI#I, Respondent-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1PR161000011) 
ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge and Hiraoka, J.
and DeWeese, Third Circuit Court J. (in place of Wadsworth,
Nakasone, McCullen and Guidry, JJ., recused)) 
Upon review of Bryan Suitt
's Letter  dated April 26, 
2024, tendered to Saguaro Correctional Center officials on 
April 28, 2024, and received by the supreme court clerk's office and filed on May 3, 2024, and the record, it appears that: 
1. The Letter requests reconsideration of our 
April 23, 2024 Order granting "Respondent-Appellee State of 
Hawaii's Motion to Dismiss Claims Against the Hawai #i Paroling 
Authority in this Appeal as Moot"; 
2. Suite's counsel filed a motion for reconsideration 
of the Order on April 29, 2024; 
3. We entered an order denying reconsideration on 
May 3, 2024; and 
4. 
"Only one motion for reconsideration may be filed 
by any party," Hawai#i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 40(e). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Suitt's letter 
request for reconsideration is denied. Our April 23, 2024 Order 
dismissed only Suitt's appeal from the circuit court's denial of Ground 54 of Suitt's 
Hawai#i Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 40 
petition, involving the Hawai #i Paroling Authority; the other 
issues remain pending in this appeal. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai#i, May 7, 2024.
