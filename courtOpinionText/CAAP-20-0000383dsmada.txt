APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 3CCV-19-0000039) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, we lack appellate 
jurisdiction over Plaintiff-Appellant Meleana Lia Smith's (Smith) 
appeal from Civil No. 3CCV-19-0000039 in the Circuit Court of the 
Third Circuit (circuit court).  
The May 18, 2020 notice of appeal is untimely because 
Smith did not file it within thirty days after entry of the 
March 3, 2020 Judgment, as Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
(HRAP) Rule 4(a)(1) requires.  Further, Smith's February 25, 2020 
"Motion to Vacate Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment; Motion 
for Reconsideration" did not extend the deadline to file the 
notice of appeal, under HRAP Rule 4(a)(2), because Smith sought 
reconsideration of rulings in a separate foreclosure action, 
Civ. No. 12-1-000543, not the Judgment in the case underlying 
this appeal.  See HRAP Rule 4(a) ("If any party files a timely NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
motion . . . for a new trial . . . [or] to reconsider . . . the 
judgment . . . then the time for filing the notice of appeal is 
extended for all parties until 30 days after entry of an order 
disposing of the motion.") (Emphasis added.)  There is no 
indication in the record that the circuit court granted Smith an 
extension of time to file the notice of appeal, under HRAP 
Rule 4(a)(4). 
"As a general rule, compliance with the requirement of 
the timely filing of a notice of appeal is jurisdictional, . . . 
and we must dismiss an appeal on our motion if we lack 
jurisdiction."  Grattafiori v. State, 79 Hawai# i 10, 13, 897 P.2d 
937, 940 (1995) (citations, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted); see HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or 
justice is authorized to change the jurisdictional requirements 
contained in Rule 4 of these rules."). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are 
dismissed as moot. 
DATED:  Honolulu,  Hawai# i, November 13, 2020.
