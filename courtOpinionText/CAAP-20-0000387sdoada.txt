IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI#I 
CORNELIUS ALSTON, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI#I, Defendant-Appellee, and
JOHN DOES 1-5, Defendants 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 1CC171000364) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka and McCullen, JJ.) 
Plaintiff-Appellant Cornelius Alston (
Alston) appeals 
from the May 19, 2020 Judgment entered by the Circuit Court of 
the First Circuit (Circuit Court) in favor of Defendant-Appellee 
State of Hawai#i (State).1 Alston also challenges the January 
10, 2020 Order Granting [the State's] Motion for Summary Judgment 
[(MSJ)], filed October 21, 2019. Alston filed this civil action 
against the State alleging negligence in the calculation of 
Alston's release date and seeking damages from the State stemming from alleged overdetention. 
1 The Honorable Bert I. Ayabe presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Alston raises eight points of error on appeal, 
contending that the Circuit Court erred by: (1) granting the 
State's MSJ based on Alston v. Read
, 663 F.3d 1094 (9th Cir. 
2011); (2) disregarding the State's failure to meet its burden of production; (3) disregarding the State's arbitrary and capricious change of sentencing practices without providing him procedural safeguards to prevent overdetention; (4) disregarding that the State violated Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 1-3 (2009) by 
retroactively recalculating his release date; (5) disregarding 
that the State violated 
Hawai<i Administrative Procedure Act 
(HAPA), HRS § 91-1(4) (2012); (6) disregarding that the State's 
failure to enforce HRS § 353-12 (2015) as a cause of his 
overdetention; (7) disregarding that HRS § 706-670(5) (2014) required him to be released on August 4, 2007; and (8) disregarding his due process rights under article I, section 5 of the Hawai# i State Constitution. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve Alston's points of error as follows: 
It is undisputed that on June 14, 2007, Alston's 
release date was recalculated pursuant to Department of Public Safety (
DPS) Policy No. COR.05.05, which brought DPS into 
conformity with HRS § 706-668.5 (1993), which at that time provided, in pertinent part: 
§ 706-668.5 Multiple sentence of imprisonment . (1)
If multiple terms of imprisonment are imposed on a defendant 
2  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
at the same time, or if a term of imprisonment is imposed on
a defendant who is already subject to an unexpired term ofimprisonment, the terms may run concurrently orconsecutively. Multiple terms of imprisonment imposed atthe same time run concurrently unless the court orders orthe statute mandates that the terms run consecutively.Multiple terms of imprisonment imposed at different timesrun consecutively unless the court orders that the terms runconcurrently.
[2] 
Pursuant to the version of HRS § 706-668.5(1) in effect 
in 2007 and applicable to Alston's 1997 sentence (which was 
imposed on Alston while he was subject to a previously-imposed unexpired term), and based on the November 20, 1997 Judgment Guilty Conviction and Sentence (1997 Judgment) DPS received from 
the Circuit Court for inclusion in the DPS institutional file, we 
conclude that the Circuit Court did not err in concluding that there was no genuine issue of material fact and the State is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The State had no duty 
2 This statute was amended in 2008. See 2008 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 
193, § 1 at 714. HRS § 706-668.5 (Supp. 2023) now provides, in pertinent
part: 
§ 706-668.5 
Multiple sentence of imprisonment . (1)
If multiple terms of imprisonment are imposed on adefendant, whether at the same time or at different times,or if a term of imprisonment is imposed on a defendant whois already subject to an unexpired term of imprisonment, theterms may run concurrently or consecutively. Multiple termsof imprisonment run concurrently unless the court orders orthe statute mandates that the terms run consecutively. 
. . . . 
(3) For 
terms of imprisonment imposed prior to June
18, 2008, the department of corrections and rehabilitationshall post written notice in all inmate housing units andthe facility library at each correctional facility for aperiod of two months and send written notice to thedefendant no later than January 1, 2016, that shall includebut not be limited to: 
(a) Notice that the department of corrections andrehabilitation may recalculate the multipleterms of imprisonment imposed on the defendant;and 
(b) Notice of the defendant's right to have thecourt review the defendant's sentence.

to seek out further court files or fail to act in accordance with 
unambiguous law. See Alston
, 663 F.3d at 1099-1100 (holding that 
Alston's sentence was appropriately calculated under Hawai#i law 
and that DPS employees were entitled to rely on the 1997 Judgment received from the court, "and were not required to go in search of additional courthouse records" for further documents). 
Based on the 1997 Judgment and the applicable law, 
Alston's release date was not miscalculated on June 14, 2007. 
A 
written order entered on December 10, 1997, about 20 days after the 1997 Judgment, i.e., Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Imposing Mandatory Minimum Term for Repeat Offender Sentencing (Post-Judgment Sentencing Order), indicated that the 
sentencing court intended for Alston to serve the five and ten 
year sentences in the 1997 Judgment concurrent with his previously-imposed sentence, as well as concurrent with each other. However, as previously litigated in Alston's federal law suit, DPS employees were entitled to rely on the 1997 Judgment, and were not required to go in search of additional court records for further documents. 
On December 19, 2007, Alston filed a Motion to Correct 
Judgment (Motion to Correct) citing, inter alia, the Post-
Judgment Sentencing Order. On December 27, 2007, the Circuit 
Court entered an Amended Judgment of Conviction and Sentence; (Amended Judgment), which expressly states that the 1997 
sentences run concurrent with any other sentence being served, 
nunc pro tunc from November 20, 1997. Alston was released the same day as the entry of the Amended Judgment. See Alston v.

Read, 678 F.Supp.2d 1061, 1072 (D. Haw. 2010), rev'd on other 
grounds by Alston, 663 F.3d at 1094. Accordingly, Alston was not overdetained, and therefore, his claim of negligence and any other claims based on overdetention fail. See Simeona v. 
Dydasco, CAAP-12-0000706, 2015 WL 1400952, *3 (Haw. App. March 27, 2015) (SDO), cert. rejected, 2015 WL 4756462 (Haw. Aug. 10, 2015); Collier v. State, CAAP-19-0000792, 2024 WL 863295, *2 (Haw. App. Feb. 29, 2024) (SDO). 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's May 19, 2020 
Judgment is affirmed.
