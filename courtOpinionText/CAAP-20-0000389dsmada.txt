NO. CAAP-20-0000389 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I  
ANTHONY LE, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Respondent-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1PR191000004 (CR. NO. 1PC151001009)) 
ORDER 
DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
AND 
DISMISSING ALL PENDING MOTIONS AS MOOT 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
jurisdiction over the appeal that Petitioner-Appellant Anthony 
Le (Le), self-represented
, has asserted from the December 24, 
2019 order denying Le's petition for post-conviction relief pursuant to Rule 40 of the 
Hawai# i Rules of Penal Procedure 
(HRPP) (Order Denying Rule 40 Petition) in S.P.P. No. 1PR191000004, because the appeal is untimely under Rule 4(b) 
of the Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP). 
"[P]ursuant to HRAP Rule 4(b), an appeal from an order 
denying post-conviction relief must either be filed within thirty 
days after the entry of the order denying the HRPP Rule 40 
petition or, in the alternative, after the announcement but 
before the entry of the order." Grattafiori v. State
, 79 Hawai# i 
10, 13, 897 P.2d 937, 940 (1995). Under similar circumstances, the Supreme Court of Hawai# i has held that, when a self
-NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
represented prisoner attempts to assert an appeal, the "notice of 
appeal is deemed filed for purposes of [HRAP] Rule 4(a) on the 
day it is tendered to prison officials by a pro se prisoner." 
Setala v. J.C. Penney Company
, 97 Hawai# i 484, 485, 40 P.3d 886, 
887 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
Here, HRAP Rule 4(b) provides the controlling time 
period for filing a notice of appeal, and the holding in 
Setala 
controls when the notice of appeal is deemed filed. Contrary to 
the thirty-day time limitation under HRAP Rule 4(b)(1), Le did 
not tender his notice of appeal, which bears a signature date of 
May 18, 2020, within thirty days after entry of the December 24, 
2019 Order Denying Rule 40 Petition. Therefore, Le's appeal is 
not timely. Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number 
CAAP-20-0000389 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions 
in CAAP-20-0000389 are dismissed as moot.

Honolulu, Hawai# i, June 3, 2020.
