STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
KAULANA K. ALO-KAONOHI, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 2PC141000489(2)) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, and Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
In these consolidated appeals, Defendant-Appellant 
Kaulana K. Alo-Kaonohi (A
lo-Kaonohi) appeals from the May 5, 2020 
"Order Setting Restitution" and the October 5, 2020 "Amended 
Judgment; Conviction and Probation Sentence; Terms and Conditions of Probation; Notice of Entry," entered in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit.  In accordance with a plea agreement with 
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai# i (State), Alo-Kaonohi pled no 
contest to Assault in the First Degree (Assault One), in 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707-710 (2014).  As 
2/1/
1/ The Honorable Peter T. Cahill presided. On October 8, 2020, this
court entered an "Order Consolidating CAAP-20-0000401 and CAAP-20-0000596
Under CAAP-20-0000401." 
2/ Alo-Kaonohi pled no contest to Count Two of the indictment, which
stated: 
That on or about the 13th day of February, 2014, in
the County of Maui, State of Hawaii, KAULANA K. ALO KAONOHIand/or LEVI K. AKI JR., as principals and/or accomplices,did intentionally or knowingly cause serious bodily injuryto Christopher Kunzelman [( Kunzelman )], thereby committing
the offense of Assault in the First Degree in violation ofSection 707-710(1) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes. 
(continued...) . . . . 
2/ (...continued) NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
part of his probation sentence, Alo-Kaonohi was ordered to pay 
$60,425.53 in restitution, jointly and severally with co-defendant Levi K. Aki Jr. (Aki). 
On appeal, Alo-Kaonohi contends that the Circuit Court 
erred "in ordering restitution jointly and severally in amounts and for items that were not attributed solely to those acts that [Alo-Kaonohi] was convicted of[,] that being the assault of the [complaining witness, Kunzelman]." 
After reviewing the record on appeal and the relevant 
legal authorities, and giving due consideration to the issues raised and the arguments advanced by the parties, we resolve Alo-Kaonohi's contentions as follows, and vacate and remand. 
"Review of the trial court's decision to impose 
restitution is for an abuse of discretion." State v. DeMello, 
130 Hawai# i 332, 340, 310 P.3d 1033, 1041 (App. 2013) (citing 
State v. Mundon, 121 Hawai# i 339, 349, 219 P.3d 1126, 1136 
(2009)). 
Under HRS § 706-646(2) (2014), the trial court "shall 
order the defendant to make restitution for reasonable and verified losses suffered by the victim or victims as a result of the defendant's offense when requested by the victim." "To determine whether a sufficient nexus exists for the application of HRS § 706-646, a court must determine whether the evidence supports a finding that the defendant's conduct was the cause of or aggravated the victim's loss." State v. Phillips, 138 Hawai# i 
321, 352, 382 P.3d 133, 164 (2016) (citing State v. Domingo, 121 Hawai#i 191, 195, 216 P.3d 117, 121 (App. 2009)). 
Here, on May 5, 2020, the Circuit Court entered the 
following Order Setting Restitution, which stated in relevant part: 
A restitution hearing was held on January 23, 2020
In exchange for Alo-Kaonohi's plea, the State dismissed all other charges,
which included: 
Burglary in the First Degree; Assault in the Third Degree;
two counts of Terroristic Threatening in the First Degree; Theft in the SecondDegree; and Criminal Property Damage in the First Degree. Alo-Kaonohi signeda written "Form K; No Contest Plea," stating, among other things: "I understand that the court may impose any of the following penalties foroffense(s) to which I now plead: . . . restitution[.]" 
2   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Court, having considered the record and the
arguments of counsel, and therefore, being fully advised of
the premises; IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that restitution in theabove-entitled matter is set as follows: 
Iphone $ 846.88 
Gold chain $ 5,680.00 
Land Rover $ 7,947.98 
Tools/Household items $25,088.76 
Medical costs $10,861.91 
Temporary housing $ 5,000.00 
Loss of house use $ 5,000.00 
Total $60,425.53 
Restitution is joint and several with Defendant Levi
K. Aki in 2PC141000490(2). 
The order did not contain any findings. 
Alo-Kaonohi contends that "[i]mposing restitution 
amounts that were not related to the assault of [Kunzleman] is 
not contemplated by HRS § 706-646." Alo-Kaonohi further argues: 
The State failed to prove by a preponderance of the
evidence a nexus between the items and costs sought for
restitution and the costs and damages that were actuallyincurred from the injury Kunzelman complained of. All the other items ordered for restitution other than the medical expenses were over and above those medical expenses andshould not have been imposed on [Alo-Kaonohi].
3/ 
(Footnote added.) 
We recently addressed a similar argument in State v. 
Aki, No. CAAP-20-0000300, 2022 WL ______ (Haw. App. March 28, 
2022), which arose from the same February 13, 2014 incident in which Kunzelman was injured. There, Aki pled no contest to Terroristic Threatening in the First Degree, in violation of HRS § 707-716, for his role in the incident. Id. at *__. Aki and 
Alo-Kaonohi both attended the same January 23, 2020 restitution hearing and, based on the same evidence, Aki was ordered to pay restitution in the same amount as, and jointly and severally with, Alo-Kaonohi. Id.Aki appealed in part from an order 
setting restitution that substantially mirrors the Order Setting 
3/ It appears that Alo-Kaonohi does not dispute the award of
restitution against him for medical expenses to the extent such expenses are
attributable to his actions in assaulting Kunzelman.

Restitution in this case. Id.And on appeal, Aki similarly 
argued that the State failed to elicit evidence showing that 
Aki's offense caused or aggravated Kunzelman's losses. Id. 
We analyzed that issue and ruled as follows: 
Our appellate review in this case is compromised by
the ambiguity of what constituted the record considered by
the Circuit Court in determining restitution, and by thelack of factual findings showing the factual basis of thecourt's ruling. The Hawai #i Supreme Court has repeatedly
stated that: 
cases will be remanded when the factual basis of the lower court's ruling cannot be determined from therecord." State v. Visintin, 143 Hawai #i 143, 157, 426
P.3d 367, 381 (2018) (internal quotation marksomitted). 
This rule has been applied whenever the
trial court fails to make findings of fact that arenecessary for the court's ruling. State v. Hutch, 75
Haw. 307, 331, 861 P.2d 11, 23 (1993) ("Becausefindings of fact are imperative for an adequatejudicial review of a lower court's conclusions of law,we have held that cases will be remanded when the factual basis of the lower court's ruling cannot bedetermined from the record." (alterations and internalquotation marks omitted) (quoting 
State v. Anderson,
67 Haw. 513, 514, 693 P.2d 1029, 1030 (1985)));Anderson, 67 Haw. at 514, 693 P.2d at 1030 (remandingafter determining that the lower court granted themotion to suppress without having made any findings offact). Accordingly, when a trial court has failed toissue findings of fact and the appellate court isunable to discern the factual basis of the lower court's ruling, we have held that the case should beremanded to permit the lower court or agency to makethe requisite findings. Visintin, 143 Hawai #i at 157,
426 P.3d at 381; see also Gordon v. Gordon, 135Hawai #i 340, 351, 350 P.3d 1008, 1019 (2015)
(remanding to the trial court when the record was sodeficient as to prohibit "meaningful appellatereview"). 
[In re] Elaine Emma Short Revocable Living Tr. AgreementDated July 17, 1984, 147 Hawai #i 456, 466, 465 P.3d 903, 913
(2020). 
. . . . 
[The Order Setting Restitution] did not contain anyfindings. While the Circuit Court's oral ruling appears tocontain some factual findings and a credibility finding, itis still unclear what evidence the Circuit Court relied on in determining that a causal connection existed betweenAki's offense and Kunzelman's losses. 
The State did not introduce any evidence at the
restitution hearing about Aki's offense or conduct, and AloKaonohi's offense or conduct; and only introduced ExhibitNo. 1 which listed numerous items of loss claimed byKunzelman and their values. 
It is not clear whether the 
[Pre-sentence Investigation ( PSI)] [R]eport was part of the
record of the restitution hearing, or whether the CircuitCourt considered any part of the PSI Report in determiningrestitution. It is also not clear whether and to what 
4  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
extent the Circuit Court considered any statements or
evidence presented to it, at the prior sentencing hearing. . . in determining restitution. 
While a court is not precluded from considering
evidence within the record prior to a restitution hearing,it is unclear what the Circuit Court may have relied upon inthis case. Cf. Phillips, 138 Hawai #i at 352-53, 382 P.3d at
164-65 (holding that evidence at trial and sentencingplainly demonstrated a sufficient nexus between thedefendant's attack, victim's later death, and restitutionfor funeral expenses, where defendant was convicted ofsecond-degree attempted murder); State v. Domingo, 121Hawai #i 191, 195, 216 P.3d 117, 121 (App. 2009) (holding
that based on the factual basis stipulated to at the time ofdefendant's no contest plea to Accidents Involving Death orSerious Bodily Injury, and the State's acknowledgment at therestitution hearing that the decedent, not defendant, causedthe accident that led to decedent's death, there was nosufficient nexus to order restitution where there was no conduct by the defendant that caused or aggravated thevictim's injuries or death). Unlike Phillips, 138 Hawai #i 
321, 382 P.3d 133, there was no trial here; and there was nofactual basis for Aki's no contest plea to the first-degreeterroristic threatening offense he pled to, unlike Domingo,121 Hawai #i 191, 216 P.3d 117. 
The Circuit Court's oral ruling did not articulate
what Aki's conduct was, what co-defendant Alo Kaonohi'sconduct was, and how the court connected each defendant'soffenses with the various losses claimed by Kunzelman, toaward the restitution amounts. 
Based on the current record,
this court is unable to determine whether the Circuit Court abused its discretion in ordering Aki to pay $60,425.53
 in
restitution. See [In re] Elaine Emma Short, 147 Hawai #i at 
466, 465 P.3d at 913; DeMello, 130 Hawai #i at 340, 310 P.3d
at 1041. 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate in part with
respect to the restitution condition in the Amended Judgmentof Conviction and Probation Sentence . . . ; and vacate theOrder Setting Restitution . . . , and remand for factualfindings and for further proceedings as may be necessary[,]consistent with this Summary Disposition Order. 
Id. at *__ (footnote omitted). 
The same reasoning applies here. There was no trial in 
this case, and there is nothing in the record establishing the 
factual basis for Alo-Kaonohi's no contest plea to the Assault One charge. Based on the Order Setting Restitution and the transcript of the restitution hearing, it is unclear what evidence the Circuit Court relied on in determining that a causal connection existed between Alo-Kaonohi's offense and Kunzelman's losses. And neither the Order Setting Restitution nor the Circuit Court's oral ruling articulated what Alo Kaonohi's conduct was and how the court connected each defendant's offense with the various losses claimed by Kunzelman. Based on the 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
current record, this court is unable to determine whether the 
Circuit Court abused its discretion in ordering Alo Kaonohi to pay $60,425.53 in restitution. See In re Elaine Emma Short, 147 
Hawai#i at 466, 465 P.3d at 913. 
For these reasons, we vacate in part with respect to 
the restitution condition in the October 5, 2020 "Amended Judgment; Conviction and Probation Sentence; Terms and Conditions of Probation; Notice of Entry," and vacate the May 5, 2020 Order Setting Restitution, both entered in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit, and remand for factual findings and for further proceedings as may be necessary, consistent with this Summary Disposition Order.
