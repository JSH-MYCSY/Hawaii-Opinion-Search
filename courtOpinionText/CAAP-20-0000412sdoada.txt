IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI‘ I 
IN RE ESTATE OF RAYMOND R. CORREIA, ALSO KNOWN AS RAYMOND ROBERT 
CORREIA AND RAYMOND CORREIA 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1LP191000517) 
 
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: 
Wadsworth, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
  This appeal challenges whether the probate court 
provided sufficient notice of an April 30, 2020 telephonic 
hearing on a petition, when COVID-19 pandemic stay-at-home orders were in effect.  We conclude that sufficient notice was 
not provided under the circumstances. 1
1 We take judicial notice of the pertinent COVID- 19-related 
government orders during the relevant period, which include, inter alia, the 
State of Hawaiʻi Judiciary's numerous C OVID-19 orders, Governor David Y. Ige's 
(Governor) statewide stay- at-home order, and Mayor Kirk W. Caldwell's (Mayor) 
county-wide stay- at-home order. See Hawaii Rules of Evidence Rule 201.

Respondent-Appellant Barry Correia (Correia) appeals 
from the May 5, 2020 "Order Granting Petition for Probate of 
Will and Appointment of Personal Representative" (Order Granting Petition), and "Judgment on Order Granting Petition for Probate of Will and Appointment of Personal Representative" (Judgment), both filed and entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Probate Court).
2 
On appeal, Correia contends the Probate Court 
erroneously proceeded with a telephonic hearing on April 30, 2020, where Correia's counsel (Counsel) believed the hearing had 
been postponed based on the Judiciary's COVID-19 emergency 
orders postponing in-person hearings, and where Counsel received insufficient notice from the Probate Court that the April 30, 2020 hearing would proceed as scheduled as a telephonic hearing. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we vacate and remand. 
On July 29, 2019, Personal Representative-Appellee 
Cindy C. Santos (Santos) filed her Petition to admit into probate the will of Raymond R. Correia (Decedent), shortly after Decedent's death on June 19, 2019. Decedent's sole beneficiary 
was his daughter, Santos, and his heirs were his children — — 
Santos, Correia, and Raymond Robert Correia, Jr. Correia did not file a response to the Petition.
3 A hearing on the Petition 
was set for October 24, 2019. 
2 The Honorable R. Mark Browning presided. 
3 Correia was required to file a response or objection within 30 
days. See Hawaiʻi Probate Rule
s (HPR) Rule 10(c). Santos argues that 
Correia's failure to appear at the April 30, 2020 hearing is "irrelevant" 
because Correia was "procedurally precluded from objecting to the Petition" 
due to Correia's "failure to file a written objection or response to the

At the October 24, 2019 hearing, Correia appeared 
without counsel and requested time to retain an attorney; the 
hearing was continued to January 30, 2020. The Probate Court ordered Correia to retain counsel within ten days. 
At the January 30, 2020 hearing, Correia appeared with 
Counsel, who stated he had just been retained and requested a continuance, which the Probate Court granted. The hearing was set for April 30, 2020. 
On February 6, 2020, the Probate Court filed a "Second 
Amended Order Setting Date, Time and Place of Hearing on the 
Petition for Probate of Will and Appointment of Personal 
Representative" (Order Resetting Hearing), which reiterated that the hearing on the Petition was continued from January 30, 2020 to "April 30, 2020, at 9:00 a.m. in the courtroom of the Judge who shall be sitting in Probate." (Emphasis added.) 
COVID-19 Emergency Orders On March 4, 2020, the Governor issued the first 
"Emergency Proclamation" related to the growing threat of the COVID-19 virus, declaring a state of emergency pursuant to his 
statutory authority. Office of the Governor, State of Hawai‘ i,

On March 16, 2020 at 2:51 p.m., the first Hawaiʻi State 
Judiciary COVID-19 order was issued by Chief Justice Mark E. Recktenwald (CJ). 
See
 CJ, In the Matter of the Judiciary's
Response to the COVID-19 Outbreak, Hawai‘ i State Judiciary 
Petition." Santos is free to raise this argument before the Probate Court. 
In this appeal, however, the timeliness (or lack thereof) of such objection, 
in our view, is not a basis to deny Correia sufficient notice of the hearing itself, which is required by due process.

The 3/16/20 CJ Order cited the Governor's declaration of a state of emergency due to the COVID-19 threat and the need to take steps "to protect the health and safety of court personnel and users by minimizing the risk of spreading COVID-19 in the courts"; ordered the postponement of "[c]ivil trials and hearings" to a date after April 30, 2020; and conferred discretion to the lower courts to "allow motions to be argued telephonically" in lieu of 
postponing proceedings, as follows:

emergency and time- sensitive matters, in- person appearances 
for civil, . . . dockets will be limited starting Tuesday

On March 22 and 23, 2020, the Mayor and the 
Governor respectively, issued the first "stay-at-home" orders, both effective until April 30, 2020.

Counsel describes an April 29, 2020 telephone message 
notification, not disputed by Santos or reflected in any court 
minutes, from the Probate Court regarding the April 30, 2020 hearing. This telephone message was left on Counsel's office phone and stated "that the hearing on April 30, 2020, would go forward by telephone conference." Counsel was not in the office on April 29, 2020, because Counsel "was doing his best to observe the stay-at-home orders." As a result, Counsel claimed he "did not receive the telephone message that was left on the office's answering machine that day at a little after noon[,]" 
and "was not aware of that voice message until after the 
[h]earing." 
At the April 30, 2020 hearing, neither Correia nor 
Counsel appeared by telephone. The Probate Court's April 30, 2020 hearing minutes reflect the judicial notice of all emergency orders in effect, the absence of Correia and Counsel, and the granting of the Petition, as follows: 
Prior to the commencement of the calendar, Court took 
judicial notice of all the emergency orders that have been 
issued by both the Executive Branch, the Governor, and the 
Chief Justice and the Chief Judge. 
 . . . . 
Case called; appearance entered. 
Court took judicial notice of the record in this case, 
specifically the prior hearing that was held. 
Court noted 
that [Correia] had appeared with [Counsel] and [Counsel] reportedly stated that he was going to represent [Correia]. 
Apparently neither of them are present, therefore, the Court will proceed. 
In response to Court's query [Santos's Counsel] stated that 
he had nothing further. 
Court granted the petition. The instrument dated 8/23/2016 
is admitted to probate as the Last Will and Testament of 
the decedent. . . .

(Emphasis added.) The Order Granting Petition and Judgment were 
both filed and entered on May 5, 2020. 
On May 22, 2020, Correia filed a HPR Rule 36(b)5 motion 
for reconsideration that raised the same arguments he makes on appeal. 
On June 3, 2020, Correia timely appealed the May 5, 
2020 Order Granting Petition and Judgment.

opportunity" to be heard and "present their objections." Minton
v. Quintal, 131 Hawaiʻ i 167, 189, 317 P.3d 1, 23 (2013) (citation 
omitted). 
Correia argues that Counsel was under the mistaken 
belief that the in-person hearing was continued due to the 
various emergency orders: "It is undisputed that Counsel for Correia operated under the mis-impression, since March 16, 2020, that the April 30, 2020 hearing had been continued, through various emergency orders, until some time after the end of April 2020, and then, after the month of May 2020." 
Under the circumstances here, Counsel did not receive 
sufficient notice that the April 30, 2020 in-person hearing was not postponed or suspended, in the face of multiple emergency orders that appeared to indicate such. The initial 3/16/20 CJ Order stated unequivocally that "[c]ivil trial and hearings" 
were "postponed to a date after Thursday April 30, 2020," yet 
contained an exception in the latter part of the order, that the lower courts had discretion to "allow motions to be argued telephonically." This meant that unless a lower court stated otherwise, all civil hearings were subject to blanket postponement under the 3/16/20 CJ Order, to a date after April 30, 2020. The Probate Court Emergency Order #1 reconfirmed the postponement by stating: "[a]ll in-person hearings" are "suspended . . . until further notice[.]" In light of these orders, the record does not reflect sufficient notice to Correia and Counsel that the in-person hearing of April 30, 2020 was not 
"postponed" or "suspended." See Minton
, 131 Hawaiʻi at 189, 317 
P.3d at 23 (citation omitted). 
Counsel also argues that the Probate Court's single 
telephonic notification on his office phone the day before the 
9            
 
 
  
 
 
  
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
  
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
hearing, when stay-at-home orders were in effect, was not 
reasonable or sufficient under the circumstances: 
It is undisputed that the trial court in this 
instance left one un- responded to telephone message, less 
than twenty- four hours before the hearing, on an office 
answering machine during a period of stay- at-home orders. 
 . . . . 
During an unprecedented global pandemic, and within 
the 
context of governmental stay- at-home orders, it was not 
reasonable to notify counsel for Correia through one voice 
mail on the afternoon prior to the hearing, when the voice mail was not responded to – because it was not received due 
to compliance with the stay- at-home order. 
This argument is persuasive. 
Here, there is nothing in the record showing that the 
"Procedure for Telephonic Hearings" (Telephonic Hearings 
Procedure) was implemented for the April 30, 2020 hearing. The 
record does not reflect whether the parties were "requesting or anticipating a telephonic hearing" "[n]o later than three days before" the April 30, 2020 hearing date pursuant to the Telephonic Hearings Procedure. There is nothing in the record indicating how the in-person, in-the-courtroom hearing for April 30, 2020 was converted into a telephonic hearing on the same date. The only evidence that the Telephonic Hearings Procedure may have been implemented, was not in the Probate Court record, but rather came from Counsel's representation that the Probate Court gave telephonic notice the day before the hearing, that the hearing would proceed as a telephonic hearing. A single telephonic notification the day before the hearing, when it was 
unclear whether the Telephonic Hearings Procedure was 
implemented, was insufficient. That the single telephonic notification was to an office telephone voicemail during a period of COVID-19 stay-at-home orders, was also not reasonable. 
See Minton
, 131 Hawaiʻi at 189, 317 P.3d at 23.

   We conclude that under the circumstances of this case, 
Correia received insufficient notice of the April 30, 2020 
telephonic hearing, which violated due process.
