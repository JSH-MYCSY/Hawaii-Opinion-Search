APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 1CC131001407) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and Nakasone, JJ.)
 
Applicant for Intervention-Appellant John Hayworth 
(Hayworth), self-represented, appeals from the (1) "Order Denying 
Motion to Intervene and Set Aside, Filed October 28, 2019 and 
Striking of Answer and Counterclaim Filed on October 28, 2019" (Order Denying Motion to Intervene); and (2) "Order Denying Non-
Party John Hayworth's Motion to Rehear Motion to Intervene and  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Set Aside Filed October 28, 2019" (Order Denying Motion to
Rehear),1 both filed on July 6, 2020 by the Circuit Court of the 
First Circuit (Circuit Court).2 
On appeal, Hayworth contends that the Circuit Court 
erred by: (1) entering an August 20, 2019 foreclosure decree and 
judgment in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee for Structured Asset Investment Loan Trust, Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2006-3 (US 
Bank); (2) finding that US Bank had standing to foreclose, and 
challenging various Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law in 
the August 20, 2019 foreclosure decree; and (3) denying Hayworth's Motion to Intervene and Motion to Rehear.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we affirm. 
On August 20, 2019, the Circuit Court entered a 
foreclosure decree and judgment against Defendant-Appellee Kristin Kay Meyer (Meyer) and all defendants, foreclosing on real 
property located on Moua Street in Wai# anae, Hawai# i (
 Property). 
Hayworth was not a party to the foreclosure proceeding. 
No party appealed from the August 20, 2019 foreclosure 
decree and judgment. 
On October 28, 2019, Hayworth filed as a non-hearing 
motion, the Motion to Intervene under Hawai# i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP
) Rule 24(a),4 asserting that he had an interest 
1 Hayworth's Notice of Appeal attaches a May 1, 2020 minute order
denying Hayworth's Motion to Rehear. It is clear from the Opening Brief that
he also appeals from the November 26, 2019 minute order denying the Motion toIntervene. On July 6, 2020, the Circuit Court filed written orders denyingboth motions. We construe Hayworth's appeal to include both of these orders. 
2 The Honorable Jeannette H. Castagnetti presided. 
3  We have restated and consolidated Hayworth's points of error for 
clarity. 
4 HRCP Rule 24, entitled "Intervention," states in relevant part: 
(a) Intervention of Right.  Upon timely application anyone
shall be permitted to intervene in an action: (1) when astatute confers an unconditional right to intervene; or (2)when the applicant claims an interest relating to the
(continued...)

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
in the Property and a right to intervene based on "pre-existing 
Hawaiian Kingdom Law[.]" Hayworth also filed an "Intervener's [sic] Answer and Counterclaim" and "Amended Counterclaim." The 
Circuit Court denied the Motion to Intervene and struck 
Hayworth's Answer and Counterclaim in a November 26, 2019 minute order. 
On April 8, 2020, Hayworth filed the Motion to Rehear, 
which the Circuit Court denied in a May 1, 2020 minute order. 
On July 6, 2020, the Circuit Court filed its Order 
Denying Intervention, striking Hayworth's "Answer and Counterclaim" because he was "not a party to [the] action." The 
Circuit Court also filed its Order Denying Motion to Rehear on 
the same date. Hayworth timely appealed both orders. 
As to Hayworth's contentions (1) and (2), we do not 
have jurisdiction to consider his challenge to the August 20, 2019 foreclosure decree and judgment. Generally, a party who wishes to challenge a decree of foreclosure must do so "within the thirty day period following entry of the decree or will lose the right to appeal that portion of the foreclosure proceeding." Beneficial Hawaii, Inc. v. Casey, 98 Hawai# i 159, 165, 45 P.3d 
359, 365 (2002) (citation omitted). No party appealed the August 20, 2019 foreclosure decree and judgment, and it is not eligible for appellate review. See Mortg. Elec. Registration Sys. Inc. v. 
Wise
, 130 Hawai# i 11, 17, 304 P.3d 1192, 1198 (2013) (holding 
that a foreclosure judgment becomes "final and binding" when the time for appealing the judgment passes without an appeal being taken). Hayworth, as a non-party filing an October 28, 2019 Motion to Intervene, cannot challenge the August 20, 2019 foreclosure decree and judgment, which became final and binding when no party appealed from it. See id. 
property or transaction which is the subject of the action
and the applicant is so situated that the disposition of theaction may as a practical matter impair or impede theapplicant's ability to protect that interest, unless theapplicant's interest is adequately represented by existingparties.

(3) Hayworth argues that the Circuit Court erred when 
it denied his Motion to Intervene because he had an interest in 
the Property. Hayworth's argument appears to rely on his 
assertion that he "took possession" of the Property when it was 
"vacant or abandoned"; and he is an "heir" to the Property and entitled to possession of the same as a Native Hawaiian, through a Hawaiian Kingdom Royal land patent to "Abner Paki in 1855" based on "Hawaiian judicial precedent." 
An order denying a motion to intervene pursuant to HRCP 
Rule 24(a) is reviewed "under the right/wrong standard." Hoopai 
v. Civil Serv. Comm'n, 106 Hawai# i 205, 216, 103 P.3d 365, 376 
(2004) (ctation omitted). 
We consider four factors in 
determining intervention pursuant to HRCP Rule 24(a)(2), including: 
(1) "whether the application was timely"; (2) "whether the
intervenor claimed an interest relating to the property ortransaction which was the subject of the action"; (3)"whether the disposition of the action would, as a practicalmatter, impair or impede the intervenor's ability to protectthat interest"; and (4) "whether the intervenor's interestwas inadequately represented by the existing defendants." 
Id. (quoting Ing v. Acceptance Ins. Co., 76 Hawai# i 266, 271, 
874 P.2d 1091, 1096 (1994)). 
Hayworth does not present any cognizable legal 
authority supporting his claim of an interest in the Property. 
See State v. Kaulia, 128 Hawai# i 479, 487, 291 P.3d 377, 385 
(2013) (cleaned up) ("Whatever may be said regarding the lawfulness of its origins, the State of 
Hawai#i is now, a lawful 
government. Individuals claiming to be citizens of the Kingdom and not of the State are not exempt from application of the State's laws."); Bank of N.Y. Mellon v. Velez
, No. CAAP-12-
0000433, 2013 WL 2149695, at *1 (App. May 16, 2013) (SDO) ("Our appellate courts have repeatedly held that claims involving the applicability of the Kingdom of Hawai# i laws are without 
merit."). 
The Circuit Court was not wrong in denying the Motion 
to Intervene. See Hoopai, 106 Hawai# i at 216, 103 P.3d at 376. 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
We construe Hayworth's Motion to Rehear as a motion for 
reconsideration. "The trial court's ruling on a motion for 
reconsideration is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard." Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Wailea Elua v. Wailea 
Resort Co., 100 Hawai# i 97, 110, 58 P.3d 608, 621 (2002). 
[T]he purpose of a motion for reconsideration is to
allow the parties to present new evidence and/or arguments
that could not have been presented during the earlieradjudicated motion. Reconsideration is not a device torelitigate old matters or to raise arguments or evidencethat could and should have been brought during the earlierproceeding. 
Cho v. State, 115 Hawai# i 373, 384, 168 P.3d 17, 28 (2007) 
(alteration in original) (quoting Sousaris v. Miller, 92 Hawai# i 
505, 513, 993 P.2d 539, 547 (2000)). 
Here, Hayworth's Motion to Rehear did not "present new 
evidence and/or arguments that could not have been presented" in 
his earlier Motion to Intervene. Id.The Circuit Court did not 
abuse its discretion by denying the Motion to Rehear. See Ass'n 
of Apartment Owners of Wailea Elua, 100 Hawai# i at 110, 58 P.3d 
at 621. 
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the (1) "Order 
Denying Motion to Intervene and Set Aside, Filed October 28, 2019 and Striking of Answer and Counterclaim Filed on October 28, 2019"; and (2) "Order Denying Non-Party John Hayworth's Motion to Rehear Motion to Intervene and Set Aside Filed October 28, 2019" both filed on July 6, 2020 by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit.
