OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I  
CODY JOSEPH PRESTI, Petitioner-Appellant,
v. 
STATE HAWAI# I, Respondent-Appellee  
A
PPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 2CPN-19-0000001) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By:  Leonard, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and Nakasone, JJ.) 
Petitioner-Appellant Cody J. Presti (Presti), self-
represented, appeals from the May 20, 2020 Findings of Fact 
(FOFs), Conclusions of Law (COLs), and Order Denying Petition for
Post-Conviction Relief entered by the Circuit Court of the Second
Circuit (Circuit Court).   The Circuit Court denied Presti's Ex 
Parte Motion To Reduce Charge filed December 23, 2019, after construing it as a Hawai# i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 
40 Petition (Rule 40 Petition). 1
 
 
On appeal, Presti contends the Circuit Court 
erroneously denied his Rule 40 Petition without a hearing. 2
1 The Honorable Richard T. Bissen, Jr. presided. 
2 Presti's opening brief does not comply with Rule 28(b) of the 
Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure.  However, to promote access to justice, 
the Hawai #i Supreme Court instructs that pleadings prepared by
self-represented litigants should be interpreted liberally, and
self-represented litigants should not automatically be foreclosed fromappellate review because they fail to comply with court rules.  Erum v. Llego, 147 Hawai #i 368, 380-81, 465 P.3d 815, 827-28 (2020).  Accordingly, we address 
what we discern to be Presti's arguments. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we affirm. 
Presti's Rule 40 Petition raised three grounds for 
relief: (1) invalid plea agreement; (2) ineffective assistance of counsel; and (3) insufficient evidence for conviction.  The Circuit Court denied the Petition without a hearing on grounds that Presti's claims were "patently frivolous, without a trace of support and the issues were waived."  We review a denial of a Rule 40 petition without a hearing de novo, under the right/wrong standard of review.  Dan v. State, 76 Hawai# i 423, 427, 879 P.2d 
528, 532 (1994). 
Presti does not challenge the Circuit Court's FOFs, 
which are therefore "binding upon this court."  State v. Rodrigues, 145 Hawai# i 487, 494, 454 P.3d 428, 435 (2019) 
(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  Presti was indicted for Robbery in the Second Degree on January 26, 2018. FOF 1.  Pursuant to a plea agreement, Presti pled no contest to the amended charge of Theft in the Second Degree on August 16, 2018.  FOFs 5, 6.  The Circuit Court accepted Presti's plea and found that Presti voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently entered the plea with a full understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of his plea.  FOFs 14, 15.  The pertinent findings state: 
6.  Pursuant to a plea agreement, PRESTI changed his
plea from not guilty to no contest, and a change of plea
form was submitted to the Court. 
. . . . 
8.  PRESTI signed the acknowledgment included in the
change of plea form in open court, which states that, "I 
acknowledge that the Judge questioned me personally in opencourt to make sure that I knew what I was doing in pleadingno contest and understood this form before I signed it." 
. . . . 
12.  PRESTI confirmed that he discussed all of the 
evidence and received advice on the law from his attorney,
and did not want to contest the charge against him. 
13.  PRESTI confirmed that he was pleading of his own
free will, and that nobody was pressuring him or threateninghim or any other person to force him to plead, and that he 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
was not taking the blame or pleading to protect another
person from prosecution. 
14.  The Court found that PRESTI voluntarily,
knowingly, and intelligently entered into the plea with afull understanding of the nature of the charge against himand the consequences of his plea. 
On November 8, 2018, Presti was sentenced to five years 
of imprisonment.  FOF 16.  Presti filed the Rule 40 Petition on 
December 23, 2019; the State filed its response; Presti filed a reply; and the Circuit Court denied the petition without a hearing on May 20, 2020. 
(1) In the Rule 40 Petition, Presti argued that he was 
coerced into accepting the plea agreement, which the Circuit Court construed as an argument that Presti's conviction was obtained without understanding the nature of the amended charge and the consequences of his plea (Ground One). 
Ground One is without merit.  A "[no contest] plea made 
voluntarily and intelligently precludes a defendant from later asserting any nonjurisdictional claims, including constitutional challenges to the pretrial proceedings."  State v. Morin, 71 Haw. 159, 162, 785 P.2d 1316, 1318 (1990).  Ground One is nonjurisdictional because it does not challenge the Circuit Court's jurisdiction over the case.  See Schwartz v. State, 136 Hawai# i 258, 281, n.42, 361 P.3d 1161, 1184 n.42 (2015) 
(describing a jurisdictional defect as one that precludes the court from "exercising criminal jurisdiction").  Based on the unchallenged findings above, the Circuit Court did not err in concluding that Presti's claims were patently frivolous and without trace of support in the record, and denying the petition without a hearing.  See HRPP Rule 40(f) ("[T]he court may deny a hearing if the petitioner's claim is patently frivolous and is without trace of support . . . in the record[.]"); Dan, 76 Hawai# i at 427, 879 P.2d at 532. 
(2) In the Rule 40 Petition, Presti argued that in 
February 2019, after Presti was sentenced, his attorney failed to assist him with obtaining a duplicate copy of a lost affidavit, which the Circuit Court construed as a claim of ineffective 
3  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
assistance of counsel (Ground Two).  The Rule 40 Petition claimed 
that this affidavit from "Johnathan Bisutti"3 would support 
Presti's claim that the "amount taken in said theft was no more 
than $260.00," and that because Presti was "not the main perpetrator but rather an accomplice acting under duress," there were "mitigating factors" to warrant a reduction of the Theft in the Second Degree charge to Theft in the Third Degree. 
Ground Two is without merit, where the Circuit Court's 
unchallenged finding that Presti voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently entered the plea, precludes subsequent nonjurisdictional challenges.  See Morin, 71 Haw. at 162, 785 P.2d at 1318.  The record reflects that Presti's original charge of Robbery in the Second Degree was reduced to Theft in the Second Degree pursuant to a plea agreement, and Presti pled no contest to the reduced charge.  The Circuit Court did not err in concluding that Ground Two was patently frivolous where any error or omission by Presti's attorney regarding a lost affidavit in February 2019 could not affect any potentially meritorious defense, because any nonjurisdictional challenges to the conviction were waived.  See Maddox v. State, 141 Hawai# i 196, 
202, 407 P.3d 152, 158 (2017) (citation omitted) (brackets in original) (setting forth the elements to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as:  "(1) 'specific errors or omissions of defense counsel reflecting counsel's lack of skill, judgment[,] or diligence'; and that (2) 'those errors or omissions resulted in the withdrawal or substantial impairment of a potentially meritorious defense.'"); Morin, 71 Haw. at 162, 785 P.2d at 1318.  The Circuit Court's denial of the petition without a hearing was not erroneous.  See HRPP Rule 40(f); Dan, 76 Hawai# i at 427, 879 P.2d at 532. 
3 We take judicial notice that "Johnathan Bisutti" ( Bisutti ) was
indicted as a co-defendant with Presti in 2CPC-18-0000057, and charged with
Robbery in the Second Degree and Assault in the Second Degree.  See Hawai #i 
Rules of Evidence Rule 201; State v. Kwong, 149 Hawai #i 106, 117, 482 P.3d 
1067, 1078 (2021).  Bisutti was convicted of Assault in the Second Degree andwas sentenced on November 1, 2018.

(3) In the HRPP Rule 40 Petition, Presti alleged 
several facts: 
A. ". . . I was both assaulted and threatened in order to 
coherce [sic] my compliance in the above theft . . ."; 
B. ". . . the amount taken in said theft was no more than $260.00 and I did not keep any of that money,therefore I was not a beneficiary of the fruit of thecrime."; and 
C. ". . . I was not the main perpetrator but rather anaccomplice acting under duress, and there are severalmitigating factors in this case; it is appropriatethat this carge [sic] be reduced to theft in the third degree." 
FOF 17.  The Circuit Court construed these statements, 
collectively, as a claim of insufficient factual basis for conviction (Ground Three). 
For the same reasons set forth above, Ground 3 is 
without merit, as Presti is precluded from raising nonjurisdictional challenges to his conviction where he pled no contest.  See Morin, 71 Haw. at 162, 785 P.2d at 1318.  The Circuit Court did not err in concluding that Ground 3 was patently frivolous and without a trace of support in the record, and in denying the petition without a hearing.  See HRPP Rule 40(f); Dan, 76 Hawai# i at 427, 879 P.2d at 532. 
For the foregoing reasons, the May 20, 2020 Findings of 
Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying Petition for Post-Conviction Relief, entered by the Circuit Court for the Second Circuit, is affirmed.
