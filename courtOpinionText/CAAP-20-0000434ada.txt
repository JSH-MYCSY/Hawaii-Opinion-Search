DECEMBER 20, 2023 
GINOZA, CHIEF JUDGE, LEONARD AND HIRAOKA, JJ. 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY HIRAOKA, J. 
Leland Keala Olepau was a Department of Hawaiian Home 
Lands (DHHL) lessee. He defaulted on his lease and didn't cure

Procedure ( HRAP) Rule 43(c)(1), and are collectively referred to as the

the default. The Hawaiian Homes Commission  cancelled the lease. 
Olepau asked the Commission to reconsider. 
The Commission 
declined. Olepau filed two appeals with the circuit court. The 
circuit court consolidated the appeals, then dismissed them for lack of jurisdiction.
2 Olepau filed this secondary appeal. 
We hold that due process requires Rule 303(c)(10)3 of 
the Hawaii Rules of Evidence, Chapter 626, Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRE) be applied to the Commission's mailing under 
Hawaii Administrative Rules ( HAR) § 10-5-35(d).
4 The 
Commission's order cancelling Olepau's lease was served by regular mail. Olepau was presumed to have received the order under HAR § 10-5-35(d) and HRE Rule 303(c)(10). Olepau presented

4 HAR § 10-5-35 provides: 
(a) The commission shall cause to be served all 
orders, notices, and other papers issued by the commission,
together with any other papers required by law to be servedby the commission. Every other paper shall be served by thefiling party. 
(b) All papers served by either the commission or
any party shall be served upon all counsel of record at thetime of such filing and upon all parties not represented bycounsel or upon their designated agents, in fact or by law.Any counsel entering an appearance subsequent to theinitiation of the proceeding shall so notify all othercounsel then of record and all parties not represented bycounsel. 
(c) The final order, and any other paper required to
be served by the commission upon a party, shall be servedupon such party or upon the representative authorized toreceive service of such papers, and a copy shall befurnished to all agents designated in fact or by law. 
(d) Service upon parties shall be regarded as
complete by mail when deposited in the United States mail
properly stamped and addressed .

evidence sufficient to rebut the presumption. The circuit court 
should have conducted an evidentiary hearing to decide whether Olepau received the Commission's order in the ordinary course of mail. We also hold that Olepau's appeal from the Commission's denial of his request for reconsideration was timely. We vacate the circuit court's order dismissing Olepau's appeals, and remand for further proceedings. 
I. BACKGROUND 
After Olepau defaulted on his lease, the Commission 
ordered him to make monthly payments to cure his delinquency. He didn't make the payments. The Commission held a contested case hearing on Olepau's default. Olepau didn't attend the hearing. On July 29, 2019, the Commission filed its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Decision and Order . The Decision and 
Order cancelled Olepau's lease. The certificate of service attached to the Decision and Order stated it was mailed to Olepau at "41-172 Nakini St. Waim ānalo, HI 96795[,]" by first-class mail 
on July 29, 2019. 
Olepau petitioned the Commission for reconsideration on 
January 23, 2020. On February 12, 2020 (before the Commission ruled on the petition for reconsideration), Olepau filed an appeal from the Decision and Order, creating Judiciary Information Management System ( JIMS) no. 1CCV-20-0000234 (the 
First Appeal ). 
By Letter  dated February 13, 2020, the Commission 
informed Olepau it had no jurisdiction over his petition for 
3 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
reconsideration because he didn't ask for reconsideration within 
ten days of the Commission's Decision and Order. On March 12, 2020, Olepau filed an appeal from the Letter, creating JIMS no. 1CCV-20-0000411 (the Second Appeal ). 
The Commission and DHHL moved to dismiss the First 
Appeal and the Second Appeal. The motions were substantially identical; they argued that the circuit court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction because Olepau's notices of appeal were untimely. The court consolidated the appeals. The court entered the "Order Granting (1) Appellees' Motion to Dismiss Appeal Filed February 28, 2020 and (2) Appellees' Motion to Dismiss Appeal Filed April 3, 2020" ( Order Dismissing Appeals ) on June 3, 2020. 
Olepau filed this secondary appeal.

II. STANDARD OF REVIEW 
"The existence of jurisdiction is a question of law 
that we review de novo under the right/wrong standard." In re 
Kanahele , 152 Hawai#i 501, 509, 526 P.3d 478, 486 (2023). 
III.
 DISCUSSION 
Olepau raises four points of error. Three allege the 
Commission made substantive and procedural errors; the circuit court didn't address them because it dismissed Olepau's appeals for lack of jurisdiction. We address only Olepau's fourth point — that the circuit court erred by dismissing his appeals. 
5 Olepau died on December 12, 2022. Stacy Rosquita, the personal
representative of Olepau's estate, was substituted for Olepau under HRAP
Rule 43(a). 
4 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
A. The circuit court erred by summarily
dismissing the First Appeal. 
Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) Chapter 91 governs the 
right to appeal from an administrative agency's decision. Strict 
compliance with those provisions is required; "the timely filing of a notice of appeal is fundamental to the court's jurisdiction to review an agency's decision." Korean Buddhist Dae Won Sa Temple of Haw., Inc. v. Zoning Bd. of Appeals, 9 Haw. App. 298, 303, 837 P.2d 311, 313 (1992), overruled in part on other grounds, Rivera v. Dep't of Lab. & Indus. Rels., 100 Hawai #i 348, 
352 n.7, 60 P.3d 298, 302 n.7 (2002). 
HRS § 91-14 (Supp. 2019) provides: 
(b) Except as otherwise provided herein, proceedings
for review shall be instituted in the circuit court . . . 
within thirty days after service of the certified copy ofthe final decision and order of the agency pursuant to ruleof court[.] 
When the Commission's Decision and Order was filed, 
HAR § 10-5-35(d) stated: "Service upon parties shall be regarded 
as complete by mail when deposited in the United States mail properly stamped and addressed." The Commission's Decision and Order was filed on July 29, 2019. The certificate of service was signed by the Commission's Secretary. It certified that the Decision and Order was sent to Olepau on July 29, 2019, by "USPS First-Class Mail." 
The Hawai#i Rules of Civil Procedure ( HRCP) apply to 
appeals under HRS § 91-14. Rivera, 100 Hawai#i at 349, 60 P.3d 
at 299. "When service is by mail . . . HRCP Rule 6(e) operates 
5 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to provide the parties two additional days to file a notice of 
appeal[.]" Id.  Thus, the deadline for Olepau to appeal from the Decision and Order was Friday, August 30, 2019. The First Appeal (from the Decision and Order) wasn't filed until February 12, 2020, after the deadline. 
Olepau argues that his appeal was timely because he 
didn't receive the Decision and Order until January 13, 2020, and his appeal was filed within thirty days of that date. He offered a declaration stating that he was handed an envelope on January 13, 2020, that contained a copy of an "order cancelling my lease" that he had never seen before. The declaration stated: 
34. In late December 2019, [my calabash6 nephew] and
I went to the DHHL Kapolei office to make payments on my
loan. I was told by staff that they were not going toaccept my payment because there was an issue with my lease.They referred me to David Hoke for more information. 
35. Because I was worried about my lease and could
appreciate how important it is, I immediately made severalattempts to reach Mr. Hoke. He called me back and told me that the DHHL was not accepting my payment because my leasewas canceled in July 2019. 
36. These conversations were the first I heard of my
lease being canceled. 
37. With the help of [my calabash nephew], I called
Grace Lee at the [Native Hawaiian Legal Corporation], whosuggested that I get a copy of any notice of thecancellation of my lease. 
38. On January 13, 2020, I saw several individuals,
parked across the street by my neighbor's house at 41-171Nakini St., Waim ānalo, Hawai #i. It looked like they were
looking for someone. 
39. They then came over to my house to speak to me. 
40. On that day, Kip Akana of the DHHL handed me an
envelope containing a copy of the July 29, 2019 ordercancelling my lease and notice that I had ten days to ask 
6 "Calabash" is a colloquial term referring to a non-blood-relative
who is treated as a family member. 
6 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
for reconsideration of the cancellation. 
41. I had never seen any copy of this paperwork
before. 
42. On the envelope for that paperwork addressed to
me, I noticed that there was the wrong address, 41-289
Nakini st. [sic], on the envelope. That address was scratched out, and another wrong address, "171," washandwritten in. 
43. Attached hereto as Exhibit "A" is a copy of the
front of the envelope Mr. Akana handed to me on January 13,2020. 
44. I know that I never received this paperwork
before. This must mean that either it was not sent to me or someone stole my mail. 
The copy of the envelope attached to the declaration 
was not postmarked. The return address was for DHHL's 
Enforcement Section, not the Commission. The envelope's purported contents were not attached to the declaration. 
1. The "prisoner mailbox rule" does not apply. 
Olepau cites Setala v. J.C. Penney Co.
, 97 Hawai#i 484, 
40 P.3d 886 (2002) and argues that the "mailbox rule" applies. 
Setala recognized the prisoner  mailbox rule. 
Under the prisoner 
mailbox rule, a self-represented prisoner's notice of appeal "is deemed 'filed' . . . on the day it is tendered to prison officials[.]" Id. at 485, 40 P.3d at 887; see also Fagaragan v. 
State
, 132 Hawai#i 224, 237, 320 P.3d 889, 902 (2014) (explaining 
rationale for the rule). The prisoner mailbox rule has nothing to do with a person's receipt of an agency order served by mail, and does not apply to Olepau's notices of appeal. 
7 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2. HRS Chapter 91 applies to the Commission. 
Olepau argues that the service provisions of HAR 
§ 10-5-35, HRS § 91-14, and HRCP Rule 5(b)(3)  don't apply to the 
Commission, because they "conflict with [the Commission's] trust 
obligations to keep its beneficiaries informed regarding facts affecting their interests." Olepau's argument contradicts Hawai
#i Supreme Court precedent. 7
[HRS Chapter 91] was adopted to "provide a uniform
administrative procedure for all state and county boards,
commissions, departments or offices which would encompassthe procedure of rule making and adjudication of contestedcases." Hse.Stand.Comm.Rep. No. 8, in 1961 House Journal,at 653. Because the Commission's administrative powers arearticulated through the rules and regulations of [Hawai #i 
Administrative Rules] "in accordance with HRS chapter 91[,]"(1 Haw.Rev.Stat. 39, 63 (1992 Supp.) (HHCA, 1920, § 222),[sic] the Commission is a state agency that must conform tothe requirements of [HRS Chapter 91] when acting in theadjudication of a contested case. 
Bush v. Hawaiian Homes Comm'n, 76 Hawai#i 128, 133, 870 P.2d 
1272, 1277 (1994) (some citations omitted). 
HAR § 10-5-35 specifically applies to the Commission. 
3. The HAR § 10-5-35 provision that service iscomplete upon mailing must be rebuttable whenthe document mailed affects the recipient'sconstitutionally protected property right. 
Olepau argues that HAR § 10-5-35's provision that 
service is complete upon mailing must be rebuttable to avoid 
violating his constitutional right to due process. 
His argument 
has merit. He had a constitutionally protected property right in his DHHL lease. Cf. Aged Hawaiians v. Hawaiian Homes Comm'n, 78

agencies.

Hawai#i 192, 211, 891 P.2d 279, 298 (1995) (holding that 
qualified Hawaiian Homes Commission Act beneficiaries on 
homestead waiting lists had valid property interest in homestead awards). The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution 
provides: 
No person shall be . . . deprived of life, liberty, or
property, without due process of law[.] 
The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States 
Constitution provides: 
No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge
the privileges or immunities of citizens of the UnitedStates; nor shall any State deprive any person of life,liberty, or property, without due process of law[.]

In War Eagle Vill. Apartments v. Plummer , 775 N.W.2d 
714 (Iowa 2009), Plummer was a tenant at War Eagle Village. She 
became delinquent in rent. War Eagle Village filed a summary possession action. It served Plummer by certified mail, as allowed by Iowa statute. Plummer didn't appear at the hearing, which took place seven days after the mailing. She was defaulted and ordered to vacate the premises. She received the notice two days after the hearing, when she retrieved the certified letter 
9  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
from the post office. But the statute stated that "notice is 
received" by the tenant when it is "mailed by certified mail . . . whether or not the tenant signs a receipt for the notice[.]" Id. at 718. Plummer appealed. Of the statute, the 
Iowa Supreme Court stated: "Dropping a letter in a mailbox is not notice, yet is deemed sufficient notice. It is mere lip service to meaningful notice." Id. at 721. The court held that 
the Iowa statute, as applied in Plummer's case, violated the Iowa Constitution's due process clause.
8 Id. 
Other courts have also held that irrebuttable or 
conclusive presumptions that a mailed document is received by the addressee violate due process requirements. See, e.g. , United 
States v. Bowen , 414 F.2d 1268, 1273 (3d Cir. 1969) (holding the 
presumption that conscientious objector form mailed to draft inductee was received violates Fifth Amendment due process clause "insofar as it purports to establish such an irrebuttable presumption"); Solberg v. Sec'y of Health & Hum. Servs. , 583 F. 
Supp. 1095, 1097 (E.D. Wis. 1984) (holding the conclusive presumption that mailed notice of termination of disability benefits was received violates due process clause, but rebuttable presumption that shifts burden of presenting credible evidence of non-receipt to challenging party is constitutional); State ex rel.

about criminal defendant's appeal rights may not be given 
conclusive effect without violating Fourteenth Amendment due process clause). 
The Decision and Order in this case did not simply 
provide information; it had substantive and procedural effects on Olepau's property right — it cancelled his lease and it fixed the time within which he could request reconsideration of, or appeal from, the cancellation. Under those circumstances, due process requires that HRE Rule 303(c)(10), HRS § 626-1 (2016) be applied to the Commission's mailing. 
HRE Rule 303 (2016) provides: 
(a) General rule. A presumption established to
implement no public policy other than to facilitate the
determination of the particular action in which thepresumption is applied imposes on the party against whom itis directed the burden of producing evidence. 
(b) Effect. The effect of a presumption imposing
the burden of producing evidence is to require the trier offact to assume the existence of the presumed fact unless and 
until evidence is introduced which would support a finding
of its nonexistence , in which case no instruction on
presumption shall be given and the trier of fact shall
determine the existence or nonexistence of the presumed factfrom the evidence and without regard to the presumption.Nothing in this rule shall be construed to prevent thedrawing of any inferences. 
(c) Presumptions. The following presumptions . . .
are presumptions imposing the burden of producing evidence: 
. . . . 
(10) Letter properly addressed and mailed. A letter 
correctly addressed and properly mailed ispresumed to have been received in the ordinarycourse of mail[.] 
(Emphasis added.) 
The Commission's certificate of service stated that the 
Decision and Order was mailed, properly addressed, to Olepau on 
11 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
July 29, 2019. Under HAR § 10-5-35(d) and HRE Rule 303(c)(10), 
Olepau is presumed to have received the Decision and Order in the ordinary course of mail.
9 Olepau had the burden of rebutting the 
presumption. He did more than just submit a declaration denying receipt.  His declaration (quoted above) provided a copy of an 
envelope with the DHHL Enforcement Section's return address, and a detailed account of when and how he says he first received "a copy of the July 29, 2019 order cancelling my lease." We hold, under these circumstances, that Olepau produced evidence sufficient to rebut the HAR § 10-5-35(d) and HRE Rule 303(c)(10) presumption of receipt. 10
4. The circuit court must decide whether Olepau
received the Commission's Decision and Order in the ordinary course of mail. 
We next consider the effect of Olepau's rebuttal. HRE 
Rule 301 (2016) provides these definitions: 
(3) "Burden of producing evidence" means the obligation ofa party to introduce evidence of the existence ornonexistence of a relevant fact sufficient to avoid an adverse peremptory finding on that fact. 
(4) "Burden of proof" means the obligation of a party toestablish by evidence a requisite degree of beliefconcerning a relevant fact in the mind of the trier offact. The burden of proof may require a party toestablish the existence or nonexistence of a fact by a 
9 The Commission's form of certificate of service included an option
for service by "Certified Mail, Return Receipt Requested[.]" We express noopinion about whether, or how, HRE Rule 303 would apply had the Decision andOrder been mailed to Olepau in that manner. 
10 We express no opinion about whether submission of a declaration
simply denying receipt would be sufficient to rebut the presumption. See 
Solberg, 583 F. Supp. at 1098 (self-serving allegations of plaintiff and her
father were not sufficient to overcome presumption that properly mailed letterhad been duly delivered to plaintiff). 
12 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
preponderance of the evidence or by clear and
convincing proof. 
The HRE Rule 303(c)(10) presumption imposes a burden of 
producing evidence. As described by Professor Bowman: 
The effect of each of the burden of production
presumptions of rule 303 is to require a finding of thepresumed fact unless "evidence is introduced which wouldsupport a finding of its nonexistence," in which event thepresumption vanishes and the factfinder decides the matteras it would any other contested fact issue. As described in the commentary to rule 302, this is the "bursting bubble."The contradictory evidence that dispels the presumption canbe direct or circumstantial, but it must be sufficient tosupport a determination of the nonexistence of the presumedfact. 
A. Bowman, Hawaii Rules of Evidence Manual, § 303-1[2], at 3-12 
(2022-2023 ed.) (LexisNexis). 
The official commentary to HRE Rule 302 states: 
Disagreement over the nature, scope, and effect of
legal presumptions has gone on for decades. The position
most widely adopted in American jurisdictions is the Thayerview, sometimes termed the "bursting bubble" theory,McCormick §[ ]345. The sole effect of a legal presumption,in this view, is to impose upon the party against whom it isdirected the requirement of producing evidence adequate tosustain a finding of its nonexistence. If this requirementis met, the presumption disappears. See W. Thayer,Preliminary Treatise on Evidence, 313-352 (1898). This theory is endorsed by Wigmore, see 9 J. Wigmore, A Treatiseon the Anglo-American System of Evidence in Trials at CommonLaw §[ ]2491(2) (3d ed. 1940), with slight modifications,id. at §[ ]2498a, and is reflected in Fed. R. Evid. 301. 
(Bracketed material omitted.) 
The current reference to the "bursting bubble" from 
McCormick on Evidence is: 
[U]nder what has become known as the Thayer or "burstingbubble" theory, the only effect of a presumption is to shiftthe burden of producing evidence with regard to the presumedfact. If that evidence is produced by the adversary, thepresumption is spent and disappears. 
13 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2 Kenneth S. Broun et al., McCormick on Evidence  § 344 (8th ed. 
2020, July 2022 Update). 
Once Olepau submitted evidence sufficient to rebut the 
presumption of receipt, the circuit court had to decide by a 
preponderance of evidence whether Olepau actually received the Decision and Order in the ordinary course of mail. We remand to the circuit court to determine, by evidentiary hearing under HRS § 91-14(f) (Supp. 2019), whether Olepau received the Commission's Decision and Order in the ordinary course of mail, and for entry of findings of fact and conclusions of law under HRCP Rule 52(a). If the circuit court finds that Olepau first received the Decision and Order on January 13, 2020 (as he claimed), the First Appeal would be timely. See HRS § 91-14(b). 
B. The circuit court erred by dismissing the
Second Appeal. 
The Second Appeal requires a different analysis. 
Olepau appealed from the Commission's February 13, 2020 Letter 
denying his petition for reconsideration. His notice of appeal was filed on March 12, 2020, within 30 days after the Commission's Letter was mailed. Thus, the Second Appeal was filed within the time required by HRS § 91-14(b). The circuit court erred by dismissing the Second Appeal for lack of jurisdiction. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
For these reasons, we vacate the circuit court's "Order 
Granting (1) Appellees' Motion to Dismiss Appeal Filed 
14 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
