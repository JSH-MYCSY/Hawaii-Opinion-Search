2/s/ Derrick H.M. Chan
Presiding Judge

Associate Judge
/s/ Clyde J. Wadsworth
Associate JudgeJuly 21, 2020 "objection" as a non-conforming motion to dismiss
Kaiama's appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
Kaiama is appealing from the Honorable Peter T.
Cahill's July 9, 2020 interlocutory order denying Kaiama's
June 12, 2020 motion to disqualify Judge Cahill from presiding
over circuit court case number 2CCV-20-0000099.  However, the
circuit court has neither adjudicated the claims nor entered a
final judgment in circuit court civil case number
2CCV-20-0000099, as Hawaii Revised Statutes § 641-1(a) (2016) and
Rule 58 of the Hawai#i Rules of Civil Procedure require for an
appeal under the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming &
Wright, 76  Hawai #i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994).  Absent
an appealable final judgment, Kaiama's appeal is premature, and
we lack appellate jurisdiction.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the ATC Makena
Appellees' July 21, 2020 motion to dismiss Kaiama's appeal is
granted, and appellate court case number CAAP-20-0000445 is
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, July 29, 2020.
