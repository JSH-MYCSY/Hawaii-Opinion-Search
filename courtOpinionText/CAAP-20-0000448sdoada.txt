STATE OF HAWAI# I, Respondent-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 3CPN-19-0000003) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Self-represented Petitioner-Appellant Michael 
Ventrella 
appeals from the "Findings of Fact; Conclusions of Law; and Order 
Denying Petition for Post-Conviction Relief" entered by the 
Circuit Court of the Third Circuit on June 15, 2020.1 For the 
reasons explained below, we affirm the Order Denying Petition. 
On August 7, 2017, a grand jury returned a 15-count 
indictment against Ventrella.  Pursuant to a plea agreement, 
Ventrella pleaded guilty to Attempted Promoting a Dangerous Drug (heroin) in the First Degree in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 705-500 and 712-1241(1)(a).  The circuit court 
granted the State's motion to nolle prosequi the other 14 counts. 
The "Judgment of Conviction and Sentence" was entered on 
1 The Honorable Melvin H. Fujino presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
April 25, 2018; Ventrella was sentenced to an indeterminate term 
of 20 years in prison.  He did not take a direct appeal. 
Ventrella appeared before the Hawaii Paroling Authority 
(HPA) on January 14, 2019, for his minimum term hearing.  The HPA 
placed Ventrella in a Level III classification2 and set an 11-
year minimum term. 
Ventrella filed a "Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or 
Correct Illegal Sentence Through a Writ of Habeas Corpus Pursuant 
to [Hawai# i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP)] Rule 40" on 
November 18, 2019.  The Petition was heard on May 29, 2020.  The Order Denying Petition was entered on June 15, 2020.  This appeal followed. 
Ventrella raises the following issues on appeal:
3 
"1. Was [Ventrella] due the protection provided
in the Hawaii Supreme Court's ruling in Lewi
v. State?" 
"2. Does the mandatory 'floor' of each Level of
Punishment assigned by the HPA equate to amandatory minimum sentence?" 
"3. Does [Ventrella] have a right to a minimum
term sentence that is uniform to those issued to similarly-situated defendants?" 
"4. Is there a statutory mandate for a verbatim
record of [HPA] hearings?" and 
"5. Did [Ventrella] have a constitutional right
to effective legal representation at hisevidentiary hearing?" 
2 "To set a minimum sentence within the maximum term of imprisonment
range set by the sentencing court, the HPA determines an offender's 'level ofpunishment' at, from lowest to highest, Level I, II, or III."  Lewi v. State
, 
145 Hawai i # 333, 347 n.20, 452 P.3d 330, 344 n.20 (2019). 
3 Ventrella's opening brief does not comply with Rule 28(b)(4) of 
the Hawai i # Rules of Appellate Procedure ( HRAP ).  However, to promote access 
to justice, the Hawai i # Supreme Court instructs that documents filed by self-
represented litigants should be interpreted liberally, and self-representedlitigants should not automatically be foreclosed from appellate review becausethey fail to comply with court rules.  
Erum v. Llego
, 147 Hawai i # 368, 380-81, 
465 P.3d 815, 827-28 (2020).  Accordingly, we address what we discern to beVentrella's points and arguments. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The disposition of a petition under HRPP Rule 40 after 
a hearing is based on findings of fact and conclusions of law; we 
review the circuit court's findings of fact for clear error, and its conclusions of law de novo.  Coulter v. State, 116 
Hawai# i 
181, 184, 172 P.3d 493, 496 (2007).  A court reviewing an HPA minimum term decision must determine whether "the HPA has failed to exercise any discretion at all, acted arbitrarily and capriciously so as to give rise to a due process violation, or otherwise violated the prisoner's constitutional rights."  Id. (citation omitted).  For claims of procedural violations, a court will determine whether the HPA conformed with HRS § 706-669 and complied with its own guidelines, which it is required to establish by statute.  Id. (citing HRS § 706–669(8) (1993)). 
HRS § 706-669 (2014) provides, in relevant part: 
Procedure for determining minimum term of imprisonment .  (1)
When a person has been sentenced to an indeterminate . . .
term of imprisonment, the [HPA] shall . . . hold a hearing,and on the basis of the hearing make an order fixing theminimum term of imprisonment to be served before theprisoner shall become eligible for parole. 
. . . . 
(3) The prisoner shall be given reasonable notice of
the hearing under subsection (1) and shall be permitted to
be heard by the authority on the issue of the minimum termto be served before the prisoner becomes eligible forparole.  In addition, the prisoner shall: 
(a) Be permitted to consult with any persons the
prisoner reasonably desires, including theprisoner's own legal counsel, in preparing forthe hearing; 
(b) Be permitted to be represented and assisted by
counsel at the hearing; 
(c) Have counsel appointed to represent and assist
the prisoner if the prisoner so requests andcannot afford to retain counsel; and 
(d) Be informed of the prisoner's rights under
paragraphs (a), (b), and (c). 
. . . . 
(6) A verbatim stenographic or mechanical record of
the hearing shall be made and preserved in transcribed or
untranscribed form. 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
. . . . 
(8) The [HPA] shall establish guidelines for the
uniform determination of minimum sentences which shall take 
into account both the nature and degree of the offense ofthe prisoner and the prisoner's criminal history andcharacter.  The guidelines shall be public records and shallbe made available to the prisoner[.] 
(1) Ventrella contends — for the first time on appeal 
— that he was "due the protection provided in the Hawaii Supreme 
Court's ruling in" Lewi.  In that case the supreme court announced a new rule: "HPA is required to set forth a written justification or explanation (beyond simply an enumeration of any or all of the broad criteria considered) when it determines that the minimum term of imprisonment for the felony offender is to be set at a Level II or Level III punishment."  Lewi, 145 
Hawai# i at 
348–49, 452 P.3d at 345–46.  The supreme court stated that the new rule applied "to [Lewi], as well as to all cases that are on direct review or not yet final as of the date of this decision." Id. at 349 n.21, 452 P.3d at 346 n.21.  Lewi was decided on November 7, 2019.  Ventrella's minimum term determination was made on January 15, 2019.  The determination was final before Lewi was decided. 
Nor was the HPA's determination of Ventrella's minimum 
term "on direct review" when Lewi was decided.  "The legislature did not expressly provide a means to appeal HPA parole decisions."  Williamson v. Haw. Paroling Auth., 97 
Hawai# i 183, 
189, 35 P.3d 210, 216 (2001).  In Williamson, the supreme court held that a prisoner may seek judicial review of an HPA minimum term determination through a Rule 40 petition.  Id. at 195, 35 P.3d at 222.  Ventrella's HRPP Rule 40 petition was filed on November 18, 2019, after Lewi was decided.  Lewi does not apply to the HPA's determination of Ventrella's minimum term. 
(2) Ventrella contends that "the mandatory 'floor' of 
each Level of Punishment assigned by the HPA equate[s] to a mandatory minimum sentence."  In Star v. State, No. CAAP-17-0000642, 2018 WL 4327325 (Haw. App. Sept. 11, 2018) 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(SDO), cert. rejected, SCWC-17-0000642, 2019 WL 181416 (Haw. 
Jan. 14, 2019), we held: 
the HPA Guidelines  do not set an initial starting point and
increase (or decrease) the minimum term based upon certain
criteria, but rather, "[a]ll relevant criteria are evaluatedand a level of punishment is determined[.]"  The requirementin Alleyne, that facts which increase mandatory minimumsentences be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, doesnot apply to HPA minimum term hearings. 
Id. at *2 (quoting Draizen v. State, No. CAAP-12-0000708, 2015 WL 
775031, at *2 (Haw. App. Feb. 24, 2015) (SDO)) (emphasis added). Ventrella's contention lacks merit. 
(3) Ventrella contends that he had "a right to a 
minimum term sentence that is uniform to those issued to similarly-situated defendants."  He argues that "his minimum term sentence should be set at a comparable number of years to others who were convicted of the same offense in the same fiscal year." 
Contrary to Ventrella's argument, the Guidelines 
require HPA to consider multiple factors when setting minimum terms.  The Guidelines were published pursuant to HRS § 706-669(8).  Lewi, 145 
Hawai# i at 347 n.20, 452 P.2d at 344 n.20. 
The Guidelines state, in relevant part: 
The criteria [for determining the level at which a
minimum term is set] in any given case . . . that will
generally receive the greatest weight are the first threelisted at each level: Nature of Offense, the Degree ofInjury/Loss to Person or Property, and the Offender'sCriminal History. 
Hawaii Paroling Authority, Guidelines for Establishing Minimum 
Terms of Imprisonment at 3 (July 1989), https://dps.hawaii.gov/ wp-content/uploads/2012/09/HPA-Guidelines-for-Establishing-Minimum-Terms-of-Imprisonment.pdf. 
The Guidelines also list other criteria, including: 
"Character and Attitude of Offender With Respect to Criminal Activity or Lifestyle"; "Efforts Made to Live Pro-Social Life Prior to Commitment to Prison"; "Probation Revocation; Youth Adult Offender"; "Involvement of Offender in Instant Offense(s)"; "Diminished Responsibility"; and "Degree of Provocation, 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Involvement, or Complicity on the Part of the Victim(s) in the 
Offense(s)[.]"  Guidelines at 4-5, 8 (bolding omitted). 
Although "[t]he purpose of minimum sentencing 
guidelines is to provide a degree of uniformity and consistency in the setting of minimum terms[,]" see Guidelines at 1, there is no requirement that the minimum terms of prisoners convicted of the same offense in the same fiscal year be uniform. 
Ventrella challenges the circuit court's finding of 
fact no. 11: 
11. [Ventrella] does not dispute that his minimum
term may fall between 10 to 20 years as a Level III
offender. 
Ventrella disputes that he is a Level III offender, but the 
Guidelines clearly provide that the range of minimum terms for a Level III prisoner sentenced to a 20-year indeterminate term is 10-20 years.  See Guidelines at 2. 
Ventrella also challenges the circuit court's finding 
of fact no. 15: 
15. [Ventrella]'s belief is that his minimum term
sentence should be set at a comparable number of years to
others who were convicted of the same offense in the same fiscal year. 
As discussed above, this finding was a correct summary of 
Ventrella's argument. 
Ventrella challenges the circuit court's conclusions of 
law nos. 4, 6, and 7: 
4. The Hawai #i Paroling Authority is not free to
ignore the guidelines it has established.  See Coulter v. 
State, 116 Haw. 181, 185 (2007). 
. . . . 
6. The uniform determination in sentencing minimum
terms as established by § 706-669(8) is not in reference to
the average sentencing in a fiscal year, but rather the
determination set out by HPA guidelines.  See Haw. Rev. 
Stat. § 706-669(8) (1993). 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
7. The guidelines do not require Hawai #i Paroling
Authority to use a certain number of criteria, or mandate
what criteria to use.  See id . 
These conclusions of law were not wrong, although it would have 
been more accurate for no. 7 to have stated that the Guidelines do not mandate "which" of the enumerated criteria HPA must use in any given case.
(4) Ventrella contends that the HPA violated HRS 
§ 706-669(6) because the transcript of his minimum term hearing (attached as Appendix E to his HRPP Rule 40 petition) contains "broken sentences and disconnected lines of speech (represented by "--" marks) that go beyond the normal stutters, misstatements, and hesitancies of everyday speech."  The circuit court concluded: 
9. A written transcript of a hearing complies with
the § 706-669(6), HRS requirement that a verbatim
stenographic or mechanical record of the hearing shall bemade and preserved in transcribed or untranscribed form. 
See Haw. Rev. Stat. § 706-669(8) (1993). 
The circuit court did not err.  The transcript was transcribed 
from an audio tape of the minimum term hearing.  An audio tape is a "mechanical record" that complies with HRS § 706-669(6).  If Ventrella believes that the written transcript did not accurately disclose what occurred before the HPA, his remedy is prescribed by HRAP Rule 10(e)(1), which provides: 
If any differences arise as to whether the record truly
discloses what occurred in the court or agency appealedfrom, the differences shall be submitted to and settled bythat court or agency and the record made to conform to thetruth. 
(5) Ventrella contends that his attorney did not 
effectively represent him during the circuit court hearing on his 
HRPP Rule 40 petition.  The record does not disclose what transpired at the hearing because Ventrella did not request a transcript of the proceedings as required by HRAP Rule 10(b)(1). A copy of what purports to be the transcript of the circuit court hearing was attached as Exhibit F to Ventrella's opening brief, 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
but we cannot consider it because "[a]nything that is not part of 
the record shall not be appended to the brief[.]"  HRAP Rule 28(b)(10).  In addition, Ventrella failed to comply with HRAP Rule 28(a) ("If a brief raises ineffective assistance of counsel as a point of error, the appellant shall serve a copy of the brief on the attorney alleged to have been ineffective.").  For these reasons, we decline to address Ventrella's contention. 
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the circuit 
court's Order Denying Petition entered on June 15, 2020.
