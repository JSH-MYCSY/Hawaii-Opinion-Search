SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
Self-represented Plaintiff/Defendant/Counterclaimant/ 
Third-Party Plaintiff-Appellant Michael C. 
Greenspon appeals 
from the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit's  June 10, 2020 
Final Judgment, July 7, 2020 order denying Greenspon's motion 
for partial reconsideration, and 35 other circuit court 
decisions. 1
In March 2003, Greenspon obtained a $650,000.00 
mortgage loan for a property in Ha‘ ikū, Maui (the Ha ‘ik ū  
Property). In May 2006, Greenspon modified the loan, increasing the principal amount to $800,000.00. In November 2008, Greenspon was sent a notice stating that his loan was "in 
serious default" and that he must pay $27,664.44 on or before 
December 6, 2008 to cure the default. 
In February 2010, the Ha‘ikū Property was sold at a 
public non-judicial foreclosure auction to Defendant/Plaintiff/ 
Counterclaim Defendant-Appellee Deutsche Bank National Trust 
Company, as Trustee.2 
1 The Honorable Peter T. Cahill presided. 
2 Greenspon participated in various other trial and appellate cases in 
state and f ederal court against other parties involved in the non- judicial 
foreclosure of the Ha‘ikū Property .  These cases include, without limitation:  
1CC111000194 (CAAP- 13-0001432); 2CC171000090 (CAAP- 19-0000391 & CAAP- 20
-
0000442); 2CC141000379 (CAAP- 20-0000557); 2CC191000092 (CAAP- 20-0000590); and 
Civil No. 19-00516 JAO- KJM.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
After years of litigation, in October 2019, the 
circuit court compelled discovery, ordering Greenspon to allow 
the parties to inspect the Ha‘ikū  Property and submit to a 
deposition. The circuit court also verbally admonished 
Greenspon for his behavior. The following month, the circuit 
court compelled Greenspon to respond to discovery requests, 
which focused on Greenspon's use of the Ha‘ ikū Property as a 
short-term vacation rental through Airbnb.  
In March 2020, the circuit court approved and entered 
a stipulated order dismissing all claims by and against 
Greenspon, Deutsche Bank, and Third-Party Defendant-Appellee 
Ocwen
 Loan Servicing, LLC following Hawai‘i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) Rule 41(a)(1)(B). 
In May 2020, as a sanction for discovery violations 
under HRCP Rule 37, the circuit court dismissed with prejudice 
"all of Mr. Greenspon's allegations and claims brought in these 
consolidated actions against" Defendants/Third-Party Defendants-
Appellees David B. Rosen, Esq. and The Law Office of David B. Rosen (together, 
Rosen Parties) and Defendant-Appellee CIT Bank 
N.A., f.k.a. Onewest Bank N.A., f.k.a. Onewest Bank, FSB.

On appeal in this case, Greenspon raises six points of 
error3 challenging the circuit court's dismissal of the 
underlying case(s) and various decisions related to motions for 
summary judgment. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve this 
appeal as discussed below, and affirm. 
3 In his points of error (POE), Greenspon contends the circuit court 
erred: 
1. "in its failure to grant [his] MPSJ finding that the 
September, 2011 settlement agreement with the FDIC is a valid 
contract and to hold CIT and Rosen liable for tortious 
interference"; 
2. "in its failure to grant [his] MPSJ and to find that CIT and 
Rosen's 2010 auction sale on an admittedly unpublished date 
was unlawful"; 
3. in "its failure to grant summary judgment for [him] as to any elements of his claims of Appellees' 1) FDCPA and 2) HRS 
§ 480D violations, and 3) abuse of process"; 
4. "by granting [Deutsche Bank and Ocwen's] MSJ and dismissing [his] claims of forgery, fraud, and intentional/reckless 
misrepresentation"; 
5. "by granting [Deutsche Bank and Ocwen's] MSJ and dismissing 
[his] claims of conversion"; and 
6. "by capriciously dismissing [his] whole case on the eve of trial as to Appellees Rosen and CIT as a disproportional and 
unjustified Rule 37 sanction based on fallacious made- up and 
conclusory findings and erroneous and prejudicial conclusions, 
and by failing to reconsider its erroneous dismissal order and 
vacate its unjust award of fees ."

Our review of Greenspon's challenge to the circuit 
court's dismissal of these consolidated cases is dispositive.4 
Greenspon argues there was no prejudice regarding the inspection 
of the Ha‘ ikū Property and discovery requests, and appears to 
minimize his behavior throughout the proceedings. 
Under HRCP Rule 37(b)(2), if "a party fails to obey an 
order to provide or permit discovery" the circuit court may make 
orders "as are just" including "dismissing the action[.]" HRCP 
Rule 37(b)(2)(C). We review an HRCP Rule 37(b)(2) dismissal for 
an abuse of discretion. Aloha Unlimited, Inc. v. Coughlin, 79 
Hawai‘i 527, 532-33, 904 P.2d 541, 546-47 (App. 1995). 
Here, the circuit court made extensive findings 
regarding Greenspon's conduct, and Greenspon has not shown those findings were clearly erroneous. The circuit court's findings and the record in this case provide sufficient evidence to 
support the circuit court's sanction of dismissal. See
Greenspon v. Deutsche Bank, 154 Hawai‘ i 292, 550 P.3d 258, CAAP-
19-0000391 and CAAP-20-0000442, 2024 WL 2874544 at *4, *6-7 
(App. June 7, 2024) (SDO) (explaining the "extensive findings 
regarding Greenspon's contumacious conduct with respect to, 
4 We need not address POE 1-3 regarding denial of Greenspon's partial 
motions for summary judgment on various claims against CIT and Rosen parties 
where the sanctions order at issue in POE 6 dismissed all claims. 
We also need not address POE 4 and 5 because these claims are not 
within the scope of this appeal as they were dismissed by stipulation.

inter alia, the site inspection of the Ha‘ ikū  property, and 
opposing counsel's attempts to depose him") (footnote omitted); 
Erum v. Llego, 147 Hawai‘ i 368, 390, 465 P.3d 815, 837 (2020); 
W.H. Shipman, Ltd. v. Hawaiian Holiday Macadamia Nut Co., 8 Haw. 
App. 354, 362, 802 P.2d 1203, 1207 (1990). 
As such, the circuit 
court did not abuse its discretion. 
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the circuit 
court's June 10, 2020 Final Judgment and July 7, 2020 order 
denying Greenspon's motion for partial reconsideration.
