APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 5FFC-19-0000144) 
MEMORANDUM OPINION 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Wadsworth and Nakasone, JJ.) 
In this interlocutory appeal, Defendant-Appellant Luke 
Jensen Lamaku-O-Ka-Na'aua Rita (Rita) appeals from the July 8, 
2020 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law (FOFs/COLs), and Order 
Denying Defendant's Motion to Dismiss With Authorities (Order 
Denying Motion to Dismiss
) filed by the Family Court of the Fifth 
Circuit (Family Court).1 
On appeal, Rita contends that the Family Court 
"committed plain error"  when it denied Rita's Motion to Dismiss 
With Authorities based on Hawai# i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) 2
1 The Honorable Edmund D. Acoba presided. 
2 Rita contends that the Family Court committed "plain" error in
denying his Motion to Dismiss. An appellate court may recognize plain error
if the error was "not brought to the attention of the court." HRPP Rule 52(b)(emphasis added). The record reflects that Rita's Motion to Dismiss was fullylitigated before the Family Court. We construe Rita's contention as error,but not as plain error. See id.; State v. Engelby, 147 Hawai #i 222, 231-32,
465 P.3d 669, 678-79 (2020) (quoting HRPP Rule 52(b)). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

. . . . 
(b)
 By Court.  Except in the case of traffic offenses that are not
punishable by imprisonment, the court shall, on motion of the
defendant, dismiss the charge, with or without prejudice in itsdiscretion, if trial is not commenced within six months: 
(1) from the date of arrest if bail is set or from thefiling of the charge, whichever is sooner, on anyoffense based on the same conduct or arising from thesame criminal episode for which the arrest or chargewas made; or 
(2) from the date of re-arrest or re-filing of the
charge, in cases where an initial charge was dismissedupon motion of the defendant; or

not specifically raised in his Point of Error,4 Rita challenges 
COL 3, which states: 
3. The period of delay from April 6, 2020 through July
6, 2020 is an excludable period of time for purposes of the
above-stated six-month timeframe as a period of delay forgood cause due to (a) the ongoing State of Emergencyresulting from the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic and (b) theabove-mentioned Orders of the Supreme Court of the State ofHawai #i and the Chief Judge of the Circuit Court of the
Fifth Circuit, State of Hawai #i. 
HRPP Rule 48(c)(8). 
Rita disputes the date of the Rule 48 deadline, and raises 
various arguments that Chief Justice Mark E. Recktenwald's (Chief 
Justice) Order of March 16, 2020 regarding the COVID-19 emergency 
(Chief Justice's March 16, 2020 Order) was erroneously applied to 
his case. 
We hold that the Family Court did not err in applying 
the Chief Justice's March 16, 2020 Order to this case, and in 
concluding that there was no Rule 48 violation. We therefore affirm. 
I. BACKGROUND 
On July 7, 2019, Rita was arrested for Violation of a 
Protective Order under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 586-11(a). 
Bail was set, and Rita bailed out of custody two days later. 
On July 9, 2019, Plaintiff-Appellee State of 
Hawai#i (State) charged Rita via Complaint with Violation of an 
Order for Protection in violation of HRS § 586-11(a). On 
4 Rita appeals from the FOFs/COLs and Order Denying Motion to
Dismiss, but his Opening Brief does not quote any findings or conclusions
urged as error or refer to appended findings or conclusions in the Point ofError section, as required by Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure ( HRAP) Rule
28(b)(4)(C). 
However, quotations of COLs 1, 2, and 3 are set forth in the
Argument section of the Opening Brief, and it is apparent that Rita challengesCOL 3, which we address infra
. See Marvin v. Pflueger, 127 Hawai #i 490, 496,
280 P.3d 88, 94 (2012) (internal citations, quotation marks, brackets,ellipses omitted) ("[N]oncompliance with Rule 28 does not always result indismissal of the claims, and this court has consistently adhered to the policyof affording litigants the opportunity to have their cases heard on themerits, where possible. 
This is particularly so where the remaining sections
of the brief provide the necessary information to identify the party'sargument.").

September 23, 2019, Rita waived his right to a jury trial and 
requested a jury-waived trial, which the Family Court set for December 2, 2019. On December 2, 2019, Rita did not appear for trial, resulting in the Family Court ordering a bench warrant. 
On December 23, 2019, the Family Court granted recall 
of the bench warrant. On January 13, 2020, the Family Court appointed new counsel for Rita. 
On March 5, 2020, Governor David Ige issued a 
Proclamation declaring a state of emergency in the State of Hawai#i in response to the public health threat posed by the 
COVID-19 pandemic.

On March 16, 2020, at a trial status hearing,  the 
State informed the Family Court that the HRPP Rule 48 deadline would expire on May 1, 2020, and the Family Court set a new trial date for April 6, 2020. After the hearing, at 2:51 p.m. the same day, the Chief Justice's March 16, 2020 Order  was issued, that

continued criminal trials in the State of Hawai# i to a date after

unless otherwise ordered
by the chief judge of the respective circuit.

Regarding Judiciary Operations9 and required all trials to be 
"continued to a date after May 29, 2020." 
On May 28, 2020, the Chief Justice issued an Order 
Regarding Judiciary Operations (Chief Justice's May 28, 2020
Order), which extended the provisions of the previous COVID-19-
related orders, including the Chief Justice's March 16, 2020 
Order, to June 30, 2020. 
On May 29, 2020, the Fifth Circuit Chief Judge issued 
an Order Regarding the Reopening of the Family Court of the Fifth Circuit (Fifth Circuit May 29, 2020 Order Regarding Reopening), 
which resumed full operation of all criminal calendars on June 1, 
2020. 
On June 19, 2020, Rita filed his Rule 48 Motion to 
Dismiss the charge against him, arguing that the State failed to comply with HRPP Rule 48 because the six-month trial deadline, which Rita claimed was on "May 1, 2020," was not met. In the motion, Rita primarily argued that the State was bound to a prior "admission" it made, that the Rule 48 deadline expired on May 1, 2020.
10 Rita also claimed, inter alia, that the Chief Justice's 
March 16, 2020 Order did not apply to "time sensitive matters" like his case; that the Order "contains no statement that the time limitations" of HRPP Rule 48 "are tolled or extended in any way. . . ."; and that assuming arguendo the Order applied, it only extended "the Rule 48 date" until April 30, 2020, after which Rita should have been afforded a trial on May 1, 2020. Rita's motion did not argue against any excludable periods of delay under subsection (c) of Rule 48; did not include a Rule 48 
9 We take judicial notice of the Chief Justice's April 27, 2020
Order Regarding Judiciary Operations, which extended the provisions of the
Chief Justice's prior COVID-19-related orders. See HRE Rule 201(b); Uyeda,
144 Hawai #i at 172, 439 P.3d at 124. 
10 Rita argued that a Rule 48 deadline date of May 1, 2020, applied
because "[i]n admissions in judicio  the prosecuting attorney has conceded the
last date for providing the defendant a trial in compliance with Rule 48expired on May 1, 2020."

of his motion; and did not cite to any HRPP Rule 48 case law aside from "State v. Estancion [sic], 63 Haw. 264, 625 P.2d 1040 (1981)." 
The State's opposition provided a Rule 48 calculation 
chart indicating that, as of April 6, 2020, the Rule 48 deadline was May 22, 2020. The State argued that because of the Chief Justice's March 16, 2020 and April 17, 2020 COVID-19-related Orders and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the 91-day delay from April 6, 2020 to July 6, 2020 should be excluded for "good cause" under HRPP Rule 48(c)(8). In the alternative, the State argued that even if the time period after the June 1, 2020 resumption of trials was counted against the State (i.e., 35 days), Rule 48 was still not violated.
11 
In Rita's reply and during argument at the July 6, 2020 
hearing, Rita largely repeated the arguments he previously raised in his motion.
12 Rita raised one additional argument that the 
State "should have filed a motion with [the Family Court] before the Rule 48 date passed . . . ." At the conclusion of the hearing, the Family Court denied the motion. 
On July 8, 2020, the Family Court entered its 
FOFs/COLs, and Order Denying Motion to Dismiss, which stated: 
I. FINDINGS OF FACT 
1. Defendant was arrested on suspicion of Violation of
a Protective Order in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes

2. Defendant was charged with one count of Violation
of a Protective Order in violation of HRS 586-11(a) bywritten complaint, filed in this matter on July 9, 2019. 
11 In his Reply, Rita did not respond to the State's alternative
argument regarding the June 1, 2020 date for the resumption of trials in theFifth Circuit. 
12 In response to the State's arguments, Rita did not present any
argument that the Chief Justice's COVID-19-related orders and the ongoingCOVID-19 pandemic did not constitute "good cause" under HRPP Rule 48(c)(8).

II. STANDARD OF REVIEW 
We review a trial court's decision on a HRPP Rule 48 
motion to dismiss under both the "clearly erroneous" and 
"right/wrong" tests: 
A trial court's findings of fact (FOFs) in deciding an
HRPP 48(b) motion to dismiss are subject to the clearly
erroneous standard of review. An FOF is clearly erroneouswhen, despite evidence to support the finding, the appellatecourt is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. However, whether those factsfall within HRPP 48(b)'s exclusionary provisions is aquestion of law, the determination of which is freelyreviewable pursuant to the "right/wrong" test. 
State v. Choy Foo, 142 Hawai# i 65, 72, 414 P.3d 117, 124 
(2018)(citations omitted). 
III. DISCUSSION 
On appeal, Rita does not challenge COL 3's conclusions 
that: in ground (a), the "ongoing State of Emergency resulting 
from the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic" constituted good cause; and, in ground (b), that the COVID-19-related court orders constituted good cause. COL 3. Unchallenged conclusions of law are binding on appeal. See Amfac, Inc. v. Waikiki Beachcomber 
Inv. Co., 74 Haw. 85, 125, 839 P.2d 10, 31 (1992). Rita raises arguments regarding the date of the Rule 48 deadline and the applicability of the Chief Justice's March 16, 2020 Order to Rita's case, which we now address. 
Rita first argues that the Family Court erred in 
excluding the April 6, 2020 to July 6, 2020 time period because "[i]f that period is not excluded from the calculation the Rule 48 deadline expired on May 22, 2020, according to the State's own admissions in judicio." Rita claims that the State is bound on appeal by its statement in an opposition memorandum below that "the Rule 48 deadline was '5/22/20.'" Rita does not cite to any authority that obligates this court to accept a party's legal conclusion or representation, made in argument, that may or may 
11 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
not be accurate or correct. The application of Rule 48 or any of 
its exclusions, and determination of whether the six-month deadline under the rule is violated, are questions of law that must be determined by the trial court in the first instance, and are freely reviewable on appeal. See Choy Foo, 142 Hawai# i at 
72, 414 P.3d at 124. 
The argument that this court must accept 
and be bound by a "May 22, 2020" deadline lacks merit. 
Second, Rita argues that the Chief Justice's March 16, 
2020 Order did not apply to "emergency and time sensitive matters," and that his jury-waived trial was a "time-sensitive" matter. It was within the discretion of the Family Court not to deem Rita's jury-waived trial a "time-sensitive matter." 
A trial 
court's discretion will not be disturbed without a showing that there is a clear abuse or that the court's ruling is arbitrary and capricious. State v. Estencion, 63 Haw. 264, 267, 625 P.2d 
1040, 1043 (1981). The Family Court determined that Rita was not in custody and bailed out two days after his arrest. FOF 1. The record reflects that the Chief Justice's March 16, 2020 Order recognized an exception for "emergency and time-sensitive matters" and gave the presiding judge discretion to conduct proceedings that were "deem[ed] urgent." Given the circumstances of this case, the Family Court did not abuse its discretion in rescheduling Rita's case in accordance with the Chief Justice's March 16, 2020 Order and the Fifth Circuit March 17, 2020 Emergency Order #3. See id. 
Third, Rita argues that the Chief Justice's March 16, 
2020 Order "contains no statement that the trial time limitations of Rule 48 of the Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure are tolled or extended in any way because of the court's order," and thus, "it must be presumed [that] those orders did not intend to address or alter the rule's trial time requirements." To support his interpretation, Rita relies on the statutory construction principle of expressio unius est exclusio alterius, that "to express or include one thing implies the exclusion of the other, 
12 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
or of the alternative." Choy Foo, 142 Hawai# i at 74, 414 P.3d at 
126 (quoting Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014)) (internal 
quotation marks omitted). Rita asserts that: "[t]he fact that there have been at least three other orders which do specifically address the subject of statutory, rule, and court order deadlines and time requirements (the Chief Justice's March 20, 2020, August 27, 2020, and October 5, 2020 Orders) strongly supports" the conclusion that the Chief Justice's March 16, 2020 Order was "not intend[ed] to address or alter the rule's trial time requirements." 
While canons of statutory construction may be applied 
to court orders, "[i]f the language of the order is unambiguous and applying it in its literal sense would not produce a result that is absurd, unjust, or at odds with governing law, we are bound to enforce the plain meaning" of the court order. Lâna#ians for Sensible Growth v. Land Use Comm'n, 146 Hawai# i
  496, 
503, 463 P.3d 1153, 1160 (2020) (citing State v. Guyton, 135 Hawai#i 372, 378, 351 P.3d 1138, 1144 (2015)). The Chief 
Justice's March 16, 2020 Order is silent as to HRPP Rule 48 and contains no ambiguity in that regard. 
The Order plainly does not 
address HRPP Rule 48 in the postponement of criminal trials. Moreover, the canon of expressio unius est exclusio alterius applies to expressed and unexpressed subject matter within the same statute, not between different statutes; and thus, the canon need not be employed to different court orders. See Choy Foo, 
142 Hawai# i at 74, 414 P.3d at 126 (comparing subsections (c)(1)

and (d)(1) within HRPP Rule 48).15 Rita's reliance on the canon 
is misplaced. 
Fourth, Rita argues that "assuming arguendo that [the 
Chief Justice's March 16, 2020 Order] did suspend trials and toll 
the running of the Rule 48 clock, the order was only effective until April 30, 2020[;]" the Order "did not impact the State's ability to afford the defendant a trial in May within the Rule 48 time limits[;]" and Rita's trial was "outside the time for any mandated suspension of proceedings" under the March 16, 2020 Order. However, as set forth in FOF 13 of the Family Court's Order Denying Motion to Dismiss (which is unchallenged),
16 the 
Family Court rescheduled Rita's trial to July "due to the COVID-19 pandemic" as well as the Chief Justice's March 16, 2020 Order and the Fifth Circuit March 17, 2020 Emergency Order #3. The Chief Justice's March 16, 2020 Order authorized each circuit to "issue orders and adjust court operations as warranted to address the urgent and rapidly evolving public health conditions, including . . . postponement of in-person proceedings[.]" Additionally, Rita's claim that he could have been afforded a 
15 In Choy Foo, the Hawai #i Supreme Court explained the canon as
follows: "'[T]he contrast between a specific subject matter which is expressed
and one which is not mentioned leads to an inference that the latter was not intended to be included within the statute.'" 142 Hawai #i at 74, 414 P.3d at
126 (quoting Int'l Sav. and Loan Ass'n v. Wiig, 82 Hawai #i 197, 201, 921 P.2d
117, 121 (1996)) (emphasis added). In 
Int'l Sav. and Loan Ass'n, the court
stated: 
The inclusion of a specific matter in a statute implies theexclusion of another
 "only where in the natural association
of ideas the contrast between a specific subject matterwhich is expressed and one which is not mentioned leads toan inference that the latter was not intended to be included within the statute." 82 C.J.S. Statutes § 333, at 670(1953). 
82 Hawai #i at 201, 921 P.2d at 121 (emphases added). Both of these cases 
reference the canon of expressio unius est exclusio alterius  as applying to
specific matters within the same statute, not between different  statutes. 
16 Findings of fact which are unchallenged on appeal are binding on
the parties and on appeal. State v. Rodrigues, 145 Hawai #i 487, 494, 454 P.3d

trial in May 2020 is unavailing where subsequent COVID-19-related 
court orders extended the postponement of trials due to the ongoing state of emergency and in light of COL 3's conclusion that the state of emergency constituted good cause under HRPP Rule 48(c)(8), which Rita did not challenge. See Chief Justice's 
April 17, 2020 Order Regarding Trials (postponing all trials to a date after May 29, 2020); Fifth Circuit April 29, 2020 Amended Emergency Order #3 (adopting Chief Justice's April 17, 2020 Order requiring all trials to be continued to a date after May 29, 2020). 
Fifth, Rita argues that because the subsequent orders 
issued by the Chief Justice or the Fifth Circuit Chief Judge were not in existence when the Family Court issued its April 6, 2020 Minute Order, these orders "could not have formed the basis for the trial court's decision to continue the trial to July 6, 2020." In unchallenged FOF 13, the Family Court cited the "above-stated orders" of the Chief Justice and Fifth Circuit Chief Judge and the "COVID-19 pandemic" as the reason for rescheduling trial to July. The "above-stated orders" referred to in FOF 13, included the Chief Justice's March 16, 2020 Order (FOF 11), and the Fifth Circuit Chief Judge's March 17, 2020 Emergency Order #3 (FOF 12); no other orders are referenced in the FOFs preceding FOF 13. These FOFs foreclose Rita's argument because they establish that the Family Court did not rely on orders subsequent to April 6, 2020 when issuing its April 6, 2020 Minute Order. 
For the reasons stated above, we conclude that the 
Family Court did not err in applying the Chief Justice's March 16, 2020 Order here, and COL 3 was not erroneous.
17 See Choy 
17 Based on our resolution, it is not necessary to address Rita's
remaining argument that the State waived its right to argue against his Rule
48 motion because the State did not file a motion alerting the Family Court ofthe Rule 48 issue.

Foo, 142 Hawai# i at 72, 414 P.3d at 124. There was no Rule 48 
violation in this case because the July 6, 2020 trial date was 
before the expiration of the Rule 48 deadline of August 7, 2020.
18 
In light of our conclusion that COL 3 was not wrong in applying
the good cause exception to exclude the April 6, 2020 to July 6, 2020 time
period, we need not address the State's argument in the alternative, regardingan exclusion for the June 1, 2020 to July 6, 2020 time period. 
18 The following HRPP Rule 48 calculation, based on the Family
Court's FOFs/COLs and Order, reflects an August 7, 2020 Rule 48 deadline. In his Opening Brief, Rita concedes that the period between December 2, 2019, andApril 6, 2020, is excluded from the Rule 48 calculation due to his failure toappear for his initial trial setting. 
Dates Event(s) State (includeddays) Defense (excludeddays) Rule 48 Deadline 
7/7/19 -9/9/19 Arrest-Arraignment -FirstEntry of Plea 64 1/3/20 
9/9/19 -9/23/19 First Entry of Plea toContinued Entry of Plea 14 1/3/20 
9/23/19 -12/2/19 Continued Entry of Pleato First Bench Trial Date 70 1/3/20 
12/2/19 -4/6/20 Defendant's Failure to Appear at Initial BenchTrial Date 126 5/8/20 
4/6/20 -7/6/20 Court continuance due to COVID-19 91 8/7/20 
The total included time that had elapsed was 148 days, and thus, there
were 32 days remaining until the six-month Rule 48 deadline expired. 
In the Answering Brief and Reply Brief, the parties dispute whether the
Family Court included or excluded the 14-day period between September 9, 2019to September 23, 2019. The Family Court's COLs set forth the excludable timeperiods, but did not exclude this period of time; thus, this time period isincluded. 
We note, however, that neither the parties nor the Family Court
addressed the applicability of HRPP Rule 48(c)(1) and (d)(1), regarding thetolling of the Rule 48 deadline caused by the June 19, 2020 filing of Rita'smotion to dismiss, until its disposition on July 6, 2020. Subsections (c)(1)and (d)(1) provide that: as to pretrial motions that "delay the commencementof trial" filed by a defendant, including "motions to dismiss," the period oftime "from the filing through the prompt disposition" of the motion is "[p]erse excludable" in computing the time for trial commencement.
