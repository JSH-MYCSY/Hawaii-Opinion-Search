NO. CAAP-20-0000462 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
RL, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
DL, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. FC-D 11-1-0477) 
ORDER 
DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
AND 
DISMISSING AS MOOT ALL PENDING MOTIONS IN CAAP-20-0000462 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Chan and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record of this appeal arising out of 
a post-judgment proceeding in a divorce case, it appears that we 
lack appellate jurisdiction over this appeal by Defendant-
Appellant D.L. (D.L.) in appellate court case number CAAP-20
-
0000462 from the July 17, 2020 amended findings of fact, conclusions of law and order (July 17, 2020 amended 
FOF/COL/Order) and July 24, 2020 order awarding attorneys' fees 
and costs to Plaintiff-Appellee R.L., now known as R.V. (R.V.) in 
Family Court case number FC-D No. 11-1-0477. These two post-
judgment orders have not finally determined and ended the last 
remaining issue in the post-judgment remand proceedings for the 
re-adjudication of some (but not all) issues in D.L.'s February 
9, 2018 post-judgment motion for post-decree relief and 
Plaintiff-Appellee R.V.'s July 6, 2018 post-judgment motion to NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
enforce the July 27, 2012 divorce decree, as Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS) § 571-54 (2018) requires for an appealable final 
post-judgment order. 
In Family Court cases "[a]n interested party, aggrieved 
by any order or decree of the court, may appeal to the 
intermediate appellate court for review of questions of law and 
fact upon the same terms and conditions as in other cases in the 
circuit court[.]" HRS § 571-54. On July 27, 2012, the Family 
Court entered a divorce decree that satisfied the requirements 
for appealability under HRS § 571-54 and the holding in Eaton v. 
Eaton, 7 Haw. App. 111, 118-19, 748 P.2d 801, 805 (1987). 
Once the Family Court entered the July 27, 2012 divorce 
decree, all subsequent orders were post-judgment orders, and a 
Family Court "post-judgment order is an appealable final 
order . . . if the order finally determines the post-judgment 
proceeding." Hall v. Hall, 96 Hawai# i 105, 111 n.4, 26 P.3d 594, 
600 n.4 (App. 2001) 
(citation omitted), affirmed in part, and 
vacated in part on other grounds
, Hall v. Hall, 95 Hawai# i 318, 
22 P.3d 965 (2001), overruled in part on other grounds, Eckard Brandes, Inc., v. Dept. of Labor and Industrial Relations, 146 
Hawai# i 354, 463 P.3d 1011 (2020). Under analogous circumstances 
in civil Circuit Court cases, a "post-judgment order is an appealable final order under HRS § 641-1(a) if the order ends the 
proceedings, leaving nothing further to be accomplished." Ditto 
v. McCurdy, 103 Hawai# i 153, 157, 80 P.3d 974, 978 (2003) 
(citation omitted). 
"[T]he separate judgment requirement 
articulated in Jenkins
 [v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 
76 Hawai# i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994)] is inapposite in 
the post-judgment context." Ditto, 103 Hawai# i at 158, 80 P.3d 
at 979. 
"Accordingly, the time for appealing the matters 
conclusively decided by the . . . [post-judgment] order commenced upon entry thereof, not upon entry of the superfluous . . . 
judgment on the [post-judgment] order." Id. at 159-60, 80 P.3d 
at 980-81. 
However, the Family Court's post-judgment order must 
resolve all of the issues in the post-judgment remand proceeding 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
in order to qualify as an appealable final post-judgment order 
under HRS § 571-54. 
In a prior appeal in CAAP-18-000727 from the same 
underlying case in FC-D No. 11-1-0477, this court entered a 
January 21, 2020 memorandum opinion affirming in part and 
vacating in part the Family Court's prior adjudication of the 
D.L.'s February 9, 2018 post-judgment motion for post-decree 
relief and R.V.'s July 6, 2018 post-judgment motion to enforce 
the July 27, 2012 divorce decree. We remanded this case to the 
Family Court with instructions on how to re-adjudicate a subset 
of the issues. On remand, the Family Court is apparently 
utilizing a series of multiple post-judgment orders to adjudicate 
that subset of the issues. Under analogous circumstances in an 
appeal from a Circuit Court case in which the separate judgment 
document rule under HRCP Rule 58 did not apply, the Supreme Court 
of Hawai# i explained that, 
where the disposition of the case is embodied in several
orders, no one of which embraces the entire controversy butcollectively does so, it is a necessary inference from 54(b)that the orders collectively constitute a final judgment andentry of the last of the series of orders gives finality andappealability to all. 
S. Utsunomiya Enterprises, Inc. v. Moomuku Country Club, 75 Haw. 
480, 494-95, 866 P.2d 951, 960 (1994) (citations, internal 
quotation marks, and ellipsis points omitted). In the present 
case, the Family Court has adjudicated most of the issues by way 
of the June 17, 2020 amended FOF/COL/Order and the July 24, 2020 
order awarding attorneys' fees and costs. However, the Family 
Court expressly reserved its adjudication of the last remaining 
issue in this post-judgment proceeding, namely statutory 
interest, and, instead, the Family Court expressly scheduled a 
future December 17, 2020 hearing for its final adjudication of 
statutory interest. Consequently, this post-judgment proceeding 
has not yet concluded. 
After entry of a post-judgment order that finally 
determines this last remaining issue, any aggrieved party will 
have an opportunity to timely appeal. Because the Family Court 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
has not yet concluded this post-judgment proceeding, D.L.'s 
appeal is premature, and we lack appellate jurisdiction under HRS 
§ 571-54. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, that this case is 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions 
in CAAP-20-0000462 are dismissed as moot.
