LEONAE RODRIGUES, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 14-1-0265 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka and Nakasone, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Leonae Rodrigues (Rodrigues), self-
represented, appeals from a June 29, 2020 Order Denying 
[Rodrigues's] "Motion the Court for Reconsideration on Hearing Below" Filed February 28, 2020 (Order Denying Reconsideration) 
entered by the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit (Circuit Court).  On temporary remand from this court, on January 25, 
2021, the Circuit Court entered an Amended Judgment, which is 
1

2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
final and appealable pursuant to Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure 
Rule 54(b). 
Rodrigues filed an Opening Brief, which we have 
carefully reviewed. 
However, Rodrigues's Opening Brief does not 
comply with the Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) in 
numerous and important ways. See, 
e.g., HRAP Rules 28(b)(4), 
(7). We focus on the important infirmities because they hamper 
our review of her appeal. Rodrigues does not include any points of error or arguments that the Circuit Court erred in its rulings. Rodrigues does not include any citations to the record, including where she contends that the Circuit Court erred and where she raised her arguments or objections in the trial court. Rodrigues cites no statutes, rules, cases or other legal authorities supporting her contention that she is entitled to relief. Most fundamentally, Rodrigues makes no cogent argument that the Circuit Court erred in any way. 
Hawai#i
 courts have long adhered to the policy of 
affording litigants the opportunity to be heard on the merits whenever possible. Morgan v. Planning Dep't, Cnty. of Kauai, 104 Hawai#i 173, 180-81, 86 P.3d 982, 989-90 (2004) (citing O'Connor 
v. Diocese of Honolulu, 77 Hawai# i 383, 386, 885 P.2d 361, 364 
(1994)). In view of this longstanding policy, self-represented litigants like Rodrigues do not automatically have their access to appellate review foreclosed because of failure to conform to requirements of the procedural rules. Id. In that light, we have carefully reviewed Rodrigues's statements to the extent they

can be discerned. We nevertheless conclude that no relief can be 
granted on this appeal. 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's January 25, 2021 
Amended Judgment is affirmed.
