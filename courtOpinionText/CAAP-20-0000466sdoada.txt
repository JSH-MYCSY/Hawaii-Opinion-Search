JASON SCUTT, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v. 
MAUI MEMORIAL HOSPITAL, Defendant-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(WAILUKU DIVISION)
(CASE NO. 2DRC-20-0000967) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: 
Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Self-represented Plaintiff-Appellant Jason S
cutt 
appeals from the "Order Dismissing Without Prejudice" entered by 
the District Court of the Second Circuit, Wailuku Division1 on 
November 25, 2020. Scutt's opening brief does not comply with Rule 28 of the Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP). 
Nevertheless, to promote access to justice the 
Hawai# i Supreme 
Court instructs that pleadings prepared by self-represented litigants should be interpreted liberally, and self-represented litigants should not be automatically foreclosed from appellate review because they fail to comply with court rules. Erum v. 
Llego, 147 Hawai# i 368, 380-81, 465 P.3d 815, 827-28 (2020). 
Accordingly, we address Scutt's appeal on the merits. 
For the 
reasons explained below, we affirm the "Order Dismissing Without Prejudice." 
1 The Honorable Kirstin Hamman presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On June 29, 2020, Scutt filed a civil complaint in 
district court against Defendant-Appellee Maui Memorial Hospital. 
Rule 12 of the Hawai# i District Court Rules of Civil Procedure 
provides, in relevant part: 
(a) Answers — When presented; return day . All 
defendants shall appear or answer at the time appointed in
the summons, on the second Monday following the date ofservice, except where the district judge sets some othersecular day; and should such Monday be a legal holiday thenupon the next secular day. 
Attached to Scutt's complaint was a summons, signed by 
the district court clerk. The summons stated: 
TO THE DEFENDANT: 
You are required to file a written answer or appear
before the District Judge of this Court, in the Judge'sCourtroom, on the day and at the time designated by thechecked box on page 2. 
The boxes checked on page 2 of the summons identified the Wailuku 
Division as the location for the return, and the return day as "8:30 a.m. on the second Monday following date of service, and 
should that Monday be a legal holiday then upon the next Monday." 
Maui Memorial Hospital was served on Saturday, July 11, 
2020. The return of service was filed in the district court on 
July 16, 2020. Scutt was electronically notified of the filing of the return of service. 
The return date was Monday, July 20, 2020. The case 
was called. Scutt was not present. No attorney for Maui Memorial Hospital was present. The district court's minutes indicate the case was dismissed without prejudice. 
Scutt's notice of appeal was filed on July 21, 2020. 
On October 16, 2020, we temporarily remanded the case to the district court for entry of a written order as required by Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (2016), pursuant to Waikiki v. 
Ho#o
maka Vill. Ass'n of Apartment Owners, 140 Hawai# i 197, 204, 
398 P.3d 786, 793 (2017). 
The "Order Dismissing Without 
Prejudice" was entered by the district court on November 25, 
2020. Scutt's notice of appeal is deemed to have been filed at that time. HRAP Rule 4(b)(4). 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The district court had inherent power to dismiss the 
case for want of prosecution. See Compass Dev., Inc. v. Blevins, 
10 Haw. App. 388, 393, 876 P.2d 1335, 1338 (1994); HRS § 604-7(e) 
(2016). Scutt's opening brief presents no argument about why the district court's dismissal without prejudice was improper. The "Order Dismissing Without Prejudice" is affirmed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, April 29, 2021.
