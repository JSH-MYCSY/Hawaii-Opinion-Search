IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v. 
RUEL S. BALLESTEROS, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-19-00511) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: 
Ginoza, Chief Judge, Wadsworth and Nakasone, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Ruel S. Ballesteros (Ballesteros) 
appeals from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and 
Plea/Judgment, entered June 22, 2020, in the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division (
District Court).  
Following a bench trial, the District Court found Ballesteros guilty of, inter alia, Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant as a Third Offense Within Five Years (OVUII 3), in 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1),(b)(3) 
(Supp. 2016).
2 1 
1 The Honorable James C. McWhinnie presided. 
2 HRS § 291E-61(a)(1),(b)(3) has since been revised; the version
applicable at the time of the offense provided, in relevant part: 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if the 
person operates or assumes actual physical control ofa vehicle: 
(1) While under the influence of alcohol 
in an amount sufficient to impair the person's normalmental faculties or ability to care for the person andguard against casualty[.] 
(continued...) 2(...continued)
. . . . 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Ballesteros's sole point of error is that the District 
Court improperly relied on Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai# i's 
(State) Exhibits 4 through 8 in finding him guilty of OVUII 3, 
when the exhibits "had no relevan[ce] to the OVUII charge other 
than impermissible propensity evidence," and without that evidence, there was no substantial evidence to support the conviction. 
While he concedes Exhibits 4 through 8 were 
relevant, inter alia, to "confirm [his] prior convictions for OVUII for sentencing," he argues they could not be relied on to prove he drove while impaired, as such use would violate Hawai# i 
Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 404(b).

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we affirm for the reasons set forth below. 
In State v. Ruggiero, the Hawai# i Supreme Court 
addressed a dispute over whether the aggravating factors in HRS § 291E-61(b) are elements of the offense that must be charged and proven to a trier of fact beyond a reasonable doubt or are sentencing factors to be considered by the sentencing court. 114 Hawai
#i 227, 237-38, 160 P.3d 703, 713-14 (2007), abrogated on 
other grounds by Christian v. State, 131 Hawai# i 153, 158, 315 
P.3d 779, 784 (App. 2013), overruled by Schwartz v. State, 136 Hawai# i 258, 361 P.3d 1161 (2015); see State v. Wagner, 139 
Hawai# i 475, 484, 394 P.3d 705, 714 (2017) (distinguishing 
(b) A person committing the offense of
operating a vehicle under the influence of an
intoxicant shall be sentenced without possibility ofprobation or suspension of sentence as follows: 
. . . . 
(3) For an offense that occurs within 
five years of two prior convictions for offenses underthis section or section 291E-4(a) . . . . 
3 HRE Rule 404(b) provides, in relevant part: "Evidence of other 
crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a personin order to show action in conformity therewith."

Ruggiero, but recognizing its continued validity). The supreme 
court concluded that the aggravating factors in HRS § 291E-61(b) are not sentencing factors, and though not explicitly categorizing them as "elements," nonetheless found them to be "attendant circumstances that are intrinsic to and 'enmeshed' in the hierarchy of offenses that HRS § 291E–61 as a whole describes," and that due process therefore requires those factors to be alleged in the charging instrument and proven beyond a reasonable doubt at trial. Ruggiero, 114 Hawai# i at 238, 160 
P.3d at 714. 
Therefore, the District Court did not err in 
considering evidence of Ballesteros's prior OVUII offenses in finding him guilty of the offense of OVUII 3, provided such evidence was only considered for the purpose prescribed in Ruggerio. 
As to Ballesteros's contention that the District Court 
improperly considered the prior offenses as impermissible propensity evidence that he drove while impaired, he points to nothing in the record supporting that conclusion other than that the District Court discussed the evidence of impairment and the evidence of prior OVUII offenses in the same paragraph of the trial transcript. 
In that same paragraph, however, the District 
Court made the finding that the State had "proven beyond a reasonable doubt the violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1)(b)(3)." 
(Emphasis added). Therefore, the District Court was also 
addressing in that paragraph the attendant circumstances applicable in this case. "[W]here a case is tried without a jury, it is presumed that the presiding judge will have disregarded the incompetent evidence and relied upon that which was competent." State v. Kiese, 126 Hawai# i 494, 507, 273 P.3d 
1180, 1193 (2012) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). 
"This means that when evidence is admissible for a 
limited purpose, we presume that the judge only considered the evidence for the permissible purpose." State v. Lioen, 106 
Hawai# i 123, 133, 102 P.3d 367, 377 (App. 2004). Because the 
evidence of prior OVUII offenses is admissible for limited purposes here, this court must presume it was only considered for 
3  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
those purposes. While the presumption is rebuttable, Ballesteros 
points to no evidence in the record to rebut it. See Kiese, 126 Hawai# i at 507 n.7, 273 P.3d at 1193 n.7. 
Finally, even if the District Court had improperly 
considered the prior OVUII offenses as propensity evidence, the conviction would nonetheless be supported by substantial evidence. The appellate court reviews a sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge as follows: 
[E]vidence adduced in the trial court must be
considered in the strongest light for the prosecution
when the appellate court passes on the legalsufficiency of such evidence to support a conviction.. . . . The test on appeal is not whether guilt isestablished beyond a reasonable doubt, but whetherthere was substantial evidence to support theconclusion of the trier of fact . . . . "Substantial evidence" . . . is credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable aperson of reasonable caution to support a conclusion. 
State v. Matavale, 115 Hawai# i 149, 157-58, 166 P.3d 322, 330-31 
(2007) (internal brackets omitted). 
Here, the State produced evidence that Ballesteros 
drove on the wrong side of the road and passed over a directional 
arrow which should have informed him he was driving in the wrong direction; when asked for his documents, Ballesteros had a "blank stare" and appeared nervous; he "continuously avoid[ed] eye contact," and Officer Janghoon Cho smelled a "moderate to strong" odor of alcohol coming from him when he spoke; he refused to participate in a Field Sobriety Test (FST)
4; Officer Young Kim 
also smelled a strong odor of alcohol coming from him and observed that his eyes were red and watery; while Ballesteros rode in the back of the police car, the odor of alcohol filled up the cabin and remained there after Ballesteros exited; and during processing, Ballesteros repeatedly said "he was sorry" and that he is "not a perfect person." Considered in the strongest light 
4 Though not a factor cited by the District Court here, a
defendant's refusal to take an FST may be used as substantial evidence to
infer guilt of OVUII. See e.g., State v. Ferm, 94 Hawai #i 17, 29, 7 P.3d 193,
205 (App. 2000) (upholding OVUII conviction based, inter alia , on trial
court's finding that the defendant's refusal to submit to FST was indicativeof guilt).

for the prosecution, we find there is substantial evidence in the 
record supporting Ballesteros's conviction.5 See id. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of 
Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, entered June 22, 2020, in the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division, is hereby affirmed.

5 We do not reach Ballesteros's argument that the traffic violation
is attributable to the fact that he is not a U.S. citizen and "likely notwholly familiar with the area and traffic markings," as he failed to raisethis argument to the District Court. See State v. Miyazaki, 64 Haw. 611, 616,
645 P.2d 1340, 1344 (1982) ("[A]n issue not preserved at trial is deemed to bewaived.").
