ARISA PAVAO, formerly known as 
Marisa Ke# ala Bartolini, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
DOMINIC S. BARTOLINI, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
(FC-D NO. 5DV171000080) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, and Wadsworth and Nakasone, JJ.) 
This appeal arises out of post-judgment proceedings in 
a divorce case between Plaintiff-Appellee Marisa Pavao, formerly 
known as Marisa Ke# ala Bartolini (Wife), and Defendant-Appellant 
Dominic S. Bartolini (
Husband). Husband appeals from the 
June 24, 2020 "Order Denying [Husband's] Motion to Set Aside Divorce Decree or[,] in the Alternative, for Post-Decree Relief Filed on November 12, 2019" (Order), entered in the Family Court 
of the Fifth Circuit (Family Court).
1/ 
On appeal, Husband contends that the Family Court erred 
in denying Husband's November 12, 2019 motion to set aside 
divorce decree or, in the alternative, for post-decree relief (Motion), and in declining to hold an evidentiary hearing on the 
matter. Relatedly, Husband challenges findings of fact (FOFs) 32 
and 33, and conclusions of law (COLs) 1-4, in the Family Court's 
November 6, 2020 "Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law" 
(FOFs/COLs). 
1/ The Honorable Joseph Kobayashi presided.  
   
  
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
After reviewing the record on appeal and the relevant 
legal authorities, and giving due consideration to the issues 
raised and the arguments advanced by the parties, we resolve Husband's contentions as follows, and affirm. 
Husband contends that the Family Court erred in denying 
the Motion, which sought to set aside the court's January 23, 2018 Decree Granting Absolute Divorce (Divorce Decree or Decree), 
pursuant to Hawai# i Family Court Rules (HFCR) Rule 60(b)(3) and 
(6)
2/ or, in the alternative, to amend the Decree to equally 
divide the parties' assets and debts. Specifically, Husband argues that Wife's representations to the court in support of her October 24, 2017 Ex Parte Motion for Service by Publication constitute misconduct that requires setting aside the Divorce Decree under HFCR Rule 60(b)(3) and (b)(6). 
At a January 28, 2020 hearing on the Motion, the Family 
Court set a briefing schedule and concluded that the Motion would be decided based upon the parties' written submissions. Both sides were represented by counsel and agreed there was no need for an evidentiary hearing.
3/ 
The Family Court subsequently denied the Motion and 
entered the FOFs/COLs. The court found in relevant part: 
2/ HFCR Rule 60(b) states, in relevant part: 
Mistakes; inadvertence; excusable neglect; newly
discovered evidence; fraud . On motion and upon such terms
as are just, the court may relieve a party or a party's
legal representative from any or all of the provisions of afinal judgment, order, or proceeding for the followingreasons: 
. . . .
 (3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic
or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other misconductof an adverse party; [or]
 . . . .
 (6) any other reason justifying relief from the
operation of the judgment. The motion shall be made within a reasonable time, and
for reasons (1), (2), and (3) not more than one year after
the judgment, order, or proceedings was entered or taken. 
3/ Husband's current contention that the Family Court erred in
declining to hold an evidentiary hearing was therefore waived.

7. At [a 2016] hearing [in a prior divorce case that was

. . . . 
11. On June 2, 2017, [Wife] filed a new Complaint forDivorce in FC-D 17-000080 and represented herself.

15. These Documents were returned to [Wife] asundeliverable on August 14, 2017.

3  
  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
1. [Husband's] failure to file the Motion to Set Aside
Divorce Decree or, in the Alternative, for Post DecreeRelief, within one year of the Divorce Decree rendersthe Motion untimely under [HFCR] Rule 60(b). 
2. [Husband's] filing of the Motion to Set Aside DivorceDecree or, in the Alternative, for Post Decree Relief,9 months after his Attorney requested transcripts(February 12, 2019) in the case, was not "within areasonable time" under these circumstances and as required by [HFCR] Rule 60(b). 
3. Even if the Motion were filed within a reasonable time after the Decree, as is required by [HFCR] Rule 60(b),[Husband] failed to establish any other reasonjustifying relief under [HFCR] Rule 60(b)(6). 
4. [Husband's] request in the alternative, to amend theDivorce Decree "so that the Decree will equallydistribute the assets and debts of the parties" doesnot sufficiently state the grounds upon which[Husband] relies to support this request, nor does itadequately set forth the relief or order sought, as isrequired by [HFCR] Rule 10(a). 
At the outset, we note that Husband does not challenge 
FOFs 7, 12, 14-18, 29 and 30./ They are therefore binding on 
appeal. See Okada Trucking Co. v. Bd. of Water Supply, 97 
Hawai#i 450, 458, 40 P.3d 73, 81 (2002). The Family Court set 
forth the specific efforts made by Wife to effect service on Husband in FOFs 14 through 18, and concluded that Wife made diligent and reasonable efforts under the circumstances to serve Husband. The court further determined that Husband's allegations regarding Wife's efforts to effect proper service upon him were not credible. We "will not pass upon issues dependent upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence; this is the province of the trier of fact." Fisher v. Fisher, 111 Hawai#i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 (2006) (quoting In re Doe, 95 
Hawai#i 183, 190, 20 P.3d 616, 623 (2001)). 4
Based on our review of the record, we conclude that 
FOFs 32 and 33 and COL 3, which present mixed determinations of fact and law, were supported by substantial evidence and are not clearly erroneous.
/  Given our conclusion, we need not address 5
4/ FOF 30 is a mixed determination of fact and law. 
5/ Husband argues that he was entitled to relief under HFCR Rule
60(b)(6) because "he did not know about the then pending divorce case because
he had never been served." It is undisputed, however, that Husband was served by publication. To the extent Husband challenges Wife's efforts to effectproper service upon him, we have concluded that the Family Court's related 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Husband's remaining contentions regarding the time limits for 
filing a motion seeking relief under HFCR Rule 60(b)(3) and (6). The Family Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Motion to the extent it sought relief under these provisions. See Meyers v. Meyers
, 151 Hawai#i 492, 496, 517 P.3d 775, 779 
(App. 2022). 
Husband next contends that the Family Court erred in 
denying his alternative request for post-decree relief under HFCR Rule 10(c). 
He argues that even if his Rule 60(b) motion was 
properly denied, he "should have been allowed to pursue an equitable division of the marital estate[.]" 
The Family Court denied Husband's alternative request 
because it did not sufficiently state the grounds supporting the request and did not adequately set forth the relief or order sought, as required by HFCR Rule 10(a). Indeed, Husband's request relied on a single conclusory sentence that failed to supply the grounds for relief or even to identify the marital assets or debts at issue. COL 4 was not wrong, and the Family Court did not err in denying Husband's alternative request for post-decree relief. 
For the reasons discussed above, the June 24, 2020 
"Order Denying [Husband's] Motion to Set Aside Divorce Decree or[,] in the Alternative, for Post-Decree Relief Filed on November 12, 2019," entered in the Family Court of the Fifth Circuit, is affirmed.
