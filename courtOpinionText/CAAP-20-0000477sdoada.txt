Taylor raises three points of error on appeal, 
contending that the Circuit Court erred in this case because the court: (1) did not appropriately set and schedule hearings and meetings; (2) did not put effort into researching her painful experience, or consider her Complaint; and (3) performed the same as an unethical lawyer.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve Taylor's points of error as follows: 
Taylor's points of error do not comply with the Hawai# i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (
HRAP) in numerous and important 
ways. See, 
e.g., HRAP Rules 28(b)(4) & (7). We focus on the 
important infirmities because they hamper our review of her appeal. Taylor does not include any citations to the record, including where she contends that the Circuit Court erred and where she raised her argument or objection in the trial court. 
1 The Honorable John M. Tonaki presided. 
2 Taylor also lists two "Questions Presented" which appear to be
rhetorical in nature.

Taylor cites no statutes, rules, cases or other legal authorities 
supporting her contention that she is entitled to relief from the Judgment. Most fundamentally, Taylor makes no cogent argument that the Circuit Court erred in entering the Judgment against her. 
Hawai#i courts have long adhered to the policy of 
affording litigants the opportunity to be heard on the merits whenever possible. 
Morgan v. Planning Dep't, Cty. Of Kauai, 104 
Hawai#i 173, 180-81, 86 P.3d 982, 989-90 (2004) (citing O'Connor 
v. Diocese of Honolulu, 77 Hawai# i 383, 386, 885 P.2d 361, 364 
(1994)). In view of this longstanding policy, self-represented litigants like Taylor do not automatically have their access to appellate review foreclosed because of failure to conform to requirements of the procedural rules. See id. In that light, we have carefully reviewed Taylor's arguments to the extent they can be discerned. We nevertheless conclude that they are without merit. 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's June 23, 2020 
Judgment is affirmed.
