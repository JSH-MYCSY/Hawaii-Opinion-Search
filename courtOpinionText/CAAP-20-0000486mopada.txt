(Circuit Court),1 in favor of Petitioners-Appellants-
Appellees/Cross-Appellees West Sunset 32 Phase 1, LLC (West

Findings of Fact [(FOFs)], Conclusions of Law [(COLs)], and 
Decision and Order (FOFs/COLs/Order). I. BACKGROUND 
This dispute arises over the development of certain 
properties located in the K
îlauea Stream Valley on Kaua# i (the 
Subject Properties
). The Subject Properties are located in a 
Special Management Area (SMA). 
On July 15, 2010, Hendrikus Group, Inc. (Hendrikus) 
submitted a SMA Permit Assessment Application & Class IV Zoning 
Permit Application, proposing the following developments: (1) structures on a portion of the Subject Properties known as the Kuleana, (2) structures on a portion of the Subject Properties known as Parcel 41, and (3) archaeological & agricultural restoration. The Planning Commission held public hearings on Hendrikus's application on August 24, 2010, and September 28, 2010. On September 29, 2010, the Planning Director for the Planning Department (Planning Director) issued "Special 
Management Area Use Permit SMA (U) 2011-1, Class IV Zoning Permit 
Z-IV-2011-1, and Use Permit U-2011-1" (the Subject Permits) to 
Hendrikus for construction of a "new single-family residence, 
accessory agricultural storage and office structure, development

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of irrigation well, accessory photovoltaic installation, 
demolition of structure and archaeological restoration of historical auwai, rock walls, and terraces," subject to ten (10) conditions.  The Subject Permits did not provide a time frame 
within which Hendrikus must make substantial progress on the 
development. 
On October 11, 2018, Kaplan purchased the Subject 
Properties from Hendrikus.  On March 29, 2019, Kaplan sent a 
letter (Kaplan Application) to the Planning Commission, requesting a two-year continuance to complete the work approved 
in the Subject Permits, and approval to modify the design of the previously approved single-family residence. 
Kaplan's Application was placed on the agenda for the 
Planning Commission's April 23, 2019 public meeting as a "general business matter." The Planning Director's April 16, 2019 preliminary report on Kaplan's Application recommended approving Kaplan's request for an extension of time and request to modify the single-family residence. At the April 23, 2019 meeting, no public testimony was received, but brief statements were made by the Planning Department and Kaplan's representative. On May 2, 
2019, the Planning Commission memorialized its oral decision from 
the April 23, 2019 meeting approving Kaplan's Application. 
On May 21, 2019, Somers filed a "Petition for the 
Revocation of [the Subject Permits]" (
Petition for Revocation) 
pursuant to Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Kaua#i County 
-3-NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Planning Commission (RPPPC) Chapter 12.2 Somers requested that 
the Planning Commission either revoke the May 2, 2019 approval of 
Kaplan's modifications and deem the Subject Permits as having lapsed, or revoke the modification, require Kaplan to comply with the notice requirements, and set the matter for further hearing following public notice. Upon receipt, the Planning Director did not reject Somers's Petition for Revocation as incomplete, inaccurate, or failing to comply with the Planning Commission rules as provided in RPPPC § 1-12-3(b).
3  
On June 12, 2019, Kaplan filed a memorandum in 
opposition to Somers's Petition for Revocation, and on June 20, 2019, Somers filed a reply to Kaplan's memorandum in opposition. 
On June 17, 2019, the Planning Director issued, 
pursuant to RPPPC 1-12-5,
4 the required director's report on 
2 Somers is the owner of a nearby property on K âhili Quarry Road in 
Kilauea. 
3 RPPPC § 1-12-3(b) states, in pertinent part: 
1-12-3 Form and Content of Petition. 
. . . . 
(b) The Director may reject any petition which is
incomplete, inaccurate or fails to comply with the Rules of
the Commission[.] 
4 RPPPC § 1-12-5 states: 
1-12-5 Revocation of Permits by the Planning
Commission. The Director shall review and investigate the
basis for any petition for revocation of a permit which theCommission has final authority to grant or which theCommission makes a recommendation and report to the 
Kaua #i 
County Council, State Land Use Commission or other agencywhich has the final authority to grant. The Director shall file his report with the Commission within sixty (60) daysfrom the date of the acceptance of the petition, unless theCommission allows the Director more time to investigate thecontents of the petition. The Commission shall review the Director's report and if the Commission finds that there isreasonable cause to believe that there currently is a
(continued...) 
-4
-NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Somers's petition. The Planning Director's preliminary 
conclusion was that there is no reasonable cause to believe there is currently a failure to perform according to the conditions imposed in the Kaplan Application, and recommended denying Somers's Petition for Revocation. 
On June 25, 2019, the Planning Commission held a public 
meeting, and Somers's petition was considered under a "general business matter." Attorneys for Kaplan and Somers appeared and made statements to and took questions from the commission. The Planning Director informed the parties that the meeting was not a contested case, and that what the commission was deciding was whether to issue an order to show cause, which would involve a contested case hearing. Somers's representative requested that the matter be reset for a public hearing to allow all interested parties to be heard. The Planning Commission unanimously voted to deny Somers's petition, agreeing with the analysis of the Planning Department. On June 27, 2019, the Planning Commission issued its written decision denying Somers's Petition for Revocation. 
On July 25, 2019, Somers appealed the Planning 
Commission's decision to the Circuit Court. On June 9, 2020, the Circuit Court entered its FOFs/COLs/Order, vacating the Planning Commission's June 27, 2019 decision, and ordering: 
4(...continued)
failure to perform according to the conditions imposed, the
Commission shall issue and serve upon the party bound by theconditions an Order to Show Cause why the permit should notbe revoked or modified. 
(Emphasis added).

(A) [The Subject Permits] lapsed on September 28, 2012 and
are deemed to be no longer in effect and no further
development shall proceed under the authority of theSubject Permits; 
(B) This matter is remanded to the Planning Department
with instructions to find that Kaplan's request forthe construction of a farm dwelling unit in addition
to the pre-existing development on the Subject
Property, and amendment to modify the design of thepreviously permitted single family residence requiresa Use Permit pursuant to Chapter 8-11.3 of the KauaiCounty Code, a Class IV Zoning Permit pursuant toChapter 8-11.3 of the Kauai County Code, andconstitutes "Development" pursuant to HRS 205A-22 andSMA Rule 1.4 F, thus requiring a SMA Use Permit asdefined in SMA Rule 7.3 C; 
(C) The Director shall inform Kaplan of, and the [Planning
Commission], the Planning Department, and Kaplan shallcomply with the following requirements pursuant to SMA
Rule 7.3 C (a) - (d): the requirement of an
application pursuant to SMA Rule 8.0, the publichearing requirements pursuant to SMA Rule 9.0, thePlanning Commission's requirements for action pursuantto SMA Rule 10.0, and the area of critical concern todelineate the scope of information which the applicantmust address; and 
(D) Kaplan's request for Development shall not be approved
unless the Director or Planning Commission has firstmade the requisite findings pursuant to HRS § 205A-26(2)(A) - (C) and SMA Rule 4.0 B(1) - (3) afterconducting a public hearing and any other necessaryhearings pursuant to HRS Ch. 205A, the SMA Rules ofthe County of Kauai, and the RPPPC, consistent withthis Court's Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and
Decision and Order. 
On July 17, 2020, the Circuit Court entered the Final 
Judgment in favor of Appellees.  Kaplan appealed on July 29, 
2020. Kaua# i County cross-appealed on August 14, 2020. 
II. POINTS OF ERROR 
Kaplan raises six points of error on appeal, contending 
that the Circuit Court erred by: (1) exercising jurisdiction 
where no contested case occurred or was required to occur on Somers's petition; (2) departing from its role as an appellate court and concluding that the Subject Permits lapsed without determining that the Planning Department and Planning Commission abused their discretion in determining that substantial progress 
-6-NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
had been made under the Subject Permits; (3) concluding that the 
Planning Commission's June 27, 2019 Decision contained inadequate FOFs and COLs where the commission's discretionary decision was supported by substantial evidence in the record; (4) concluding that the extension and modification of the Subject Permits was done upon improper procedure and inadequate notice; (5) ordering that the Subject Permits had lapsed and no longer in effect without remanding the matter to the Planning Commission, depriving Kaplan of vested property rights without due process; and (6) ordering that no further development shall proceed under the Subject Permits without carrying out the mandatory analysis as to whether injunctive relief was warranted. 
Kaua#i County raises two points of error, contending 
that the Circuit Court's (1) FOFs 55 and 56 are clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the record, and (2) COLs 32, 44, 45, 46, 47, 50, 51, 76, 77, 78, 80, 85, 87, 88, 91, 94, 97, 98, 100, 102, 110, and 111 are clearly erroneous as a matter of law. 
III. APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A. Subject Matter Jurisdiction 
Whether a court possesses subject matter jurisdiction 
is a question of law reviewable de novo. Kaleikini v. Thielen, 124 Hawai# i 1, 12, 237 P.3d 1067, 1078 (2010) (citation omitted). 
If a court lacks jurisdiction over the subject matter
of a proceeding, any judgment rendered in that proceeding is
invalid. Therefore, "'[s]uch a question is valid at anystage of the case, and though a lower court is found to havelacked jurisdiction, we have jurisdiction here on appeal,not of the merits, but for the purpose of correcting anerror in jurisdiction.'"

1272, 1277 (1994) (citation omitted). 
B. Administrative Agency Decisions - Secondary Appeals 
Review of a decision made by a circuit court upon its 
review of an agency's decision is a secondary appeal. Flores v. 
Bd. of Land & Nat. Res., 143 Hawai# i 114, 120, 424 P.3d 469, 475 
(2018). The standard of review is one in which this court must determine whether the circuit court was right or wrong in its decision, applying the standards set forth in Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 91-14(g) (Supp. 2023) to the agency's decision. 
Id. 
HRS § 91-14(g) provides: 
(g) Upon review of the record, the court may affirm
the decision of the agency or remand the case with
instructions for further proceedings; or it may reverse ormodify the decision and order if the substantial rights ofthe petitioners may have been prejudiced because theadministrative findings, conclusions, decisions, or ordersare: 
(1) In violation of constitutional or statutory
provisions; 
(2) In excess of the statutory authority or
jurisdiction of the agency; 
(3) Made upon unlawful procedure; 
(4) Affected by other error of law; (5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,
probative, and substantial evidence on the whole
record; or 
(6) Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized by
abuse of discretion or clearly unwarrantedexercise of discretion. 
"[U]nder HRS § 91-14(g), conclusions of law are 
reviewable under subsections (1), (2), and (4); questions 
regarding procedural defects under subsection (3); findings of fact under subsection (5); and an agency's exercise of discretion 
-8-NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
under subsection (6)." United Pub. Workers, AFSCME, Local 646, 
AFL-CIO v. Hanneman, 106 Hawai#i 359, 363, 105 P.3d 236, 240 
(2005). 
Mixed questions of law and fact are "reviewed under the 
clearly erroneous standard because the conclusion is dependent 
upon the facts and circumstances of the particular case." Save Diamond Head Waters LLC v. Hans Hedemann Surf, Inc., 121 Hawai# i 
16, 25, 211 P.3d 74, 83 (2009) (citation omitted). IV. DISCUSSION 
A. The Circuit Court's Exercise of Jurisdiction over 
Somers's appeal Kaplan argues that the Circuit Court lacked 
jurisdiction to hear Somers's appeal from the Planning Commission's denial of his Petition for Revocation because no contested case occurred, nor was required to occur. The Circuit Court determined that Somers's Petition for Revocation of the Subject Permits was a contested case by concluding: 
19. [Planning Commission] action on a Petition for
Revocation of Permits pursuant to RPPPC Ch. 12 involves a
three-step process: (1) filing a Petition for Revocation ofPermits pursuant to RPPPC Rule 1-12-3, which the PlanningDirector may reject pursuant to RPPPC 1-12-3(b) if it isincomplete, inaccurate or fails to comply with the Rules ofthe [Planning Commission]; (2) holding a hearing pursuant toRPPPC Rule 1-12-5 to determine whether there is reasonable cause to believe that there is a failure to perform
according to the conditions imposed on the Permits and to
issue an Order to Show Cause; and (3) holding an AgencyHearing on the Order to Show Cause according to thecontested case hearing procedures contained in RPPPC ch. 6,pursuant to RPPPC 1-12-7. 
20. According to the record, the Planning Director
did not reject Somers' Petition pursuant to RPPPC Rule1-12-3(b), the [Planning Commission] did not find that therewas no reasonable cause to believe that there is a failure to perform according to the conditions imposed on thePermits pursuant to RPPPC 1-12-5, and although the [PlanningCommission] did not formally issue an Order to Show Cause,Kaplan was served with a copy of Somers’ Petition for
Revocation and filed a memorandum in opposition to the same,
to which Somers filed a reply brief.

- NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
21. At the June 25, 2019 hearing on Somers’ Petition,
attorneys for Somers and Kaplan argued the merits of Somers’
Petition, Kaplan’s architect Mr. Giorgio testified as awitness, and the [Planning Commission] voted to deny Somers’Petition based upon the merits of his Petition, not upon thethreshold matter involving lack of reasonable cause. 
22. Under RPPPC 1-12-7 the [Planning Commission] was
required to hold an agency hearing prior to denying Somers’Petition for Revocation on its merits. Pursuant to RPPPC Rule 1-1-2, "'Agency Hearing' refers only to such hearingheld by the Commission immediately prior to a judicialreview of contested case as provided in Section 91-14HRS[.]" 
23. The Court determines that the June 25, 2019
[Planning Commission] hearing on Somers' Petition forRevocation of the Subject Permits was a "Contested case" asdefined by HRS § 91-1 and RPPPC 1-1-2 (7)(i), and thatSomers may appeal the [Planning Commission's] June 27, 2019Decision to the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit pursuant
to HRS § 91-14, HRS § 603-21.8, SMA Rule 15.0, RPPPC Rule
1-6-18(i), and Rule 72 of the 
Hawai i # Rules of Civil 
Procedure. 
Judicial review over an agency appeal is authorized by 
HRS § 91–14 when the following requirements have been met: 
[f]irst, the proceeding that resulted in the unfavorableagency action must have been a contested case hearing . . .;second, the agency's action must represent a final decisionor order, or a preliminary ruling such that deferral ofreview would deprive the claimant of adequate relief; third,the claimant must have followed the applicable agency rulesand, therefore, have been involved in the contested case;and finally, the claimant's legal interests must have beeninjured—i.e., the claimant must have standing to appeal. 
In re Application of Maui Elec. Co., Ltd., 141 Hawai#i 249, 258, 
408 P.3d 1, 10 (2017) (quoting Kilakila # O Haleakala v. Bd. of 
Land & Nat. Res., 131 Hawai# i 193, 200, 317 P.3d 27, 34 (2013) 
(Kilakila)). "In other words, there are four requirements for 
judicial review over an agency appeal: a contested case hearing, 
finality, compliance with agency rule, and standing." Id.
HRS § 91–1 (Supp. 2023) defines a "contested case" as 
"a proceeding in which the legal rights, duties, or privileges of specific parties are required by law to be determined after an opportunity for agency hearing." HRS § 91–1 defines an "agency 
-10-NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
hearing" as "such hearing held by an agency immediately prior to 
a judicial review of a contested case as provided in section 91–14."
5 "Thus, '[a] contested case is an agency hearing that 1) 
is required by law and 2) determines the rights, duties, or privileges of specific parties.'" Kaniakapupu v. Land Use Comm'n, 111 Hawai# i 124, 132, 139 P.3d 712, 720 (2006) (quoting 
Pub. Access Shoreline Haw. v. 
Hawai#i Cnty. Plan. Comm'n, 79 
Hawai#i 425, 431, 903 P.2d 1246, 1252 (1995)). We first consider 
whether an agency hearing was required by law, and then consider whether the hearing would have determined the rights, duties, or privileges of the parties. 
1. Required by law? In order for an administrative agency hearing to be 
required by law, "it may be required by (1) agency rule, (2) statute, or (3) constitutional due process." Kilakila, 131 
5 RPPPC § 1-1-2(3)'s definition of "contested case" and § 1-1-
2(7)(i)'s definition of "agency hearing" are identical to the HRS language,
and state: 
1-1-2 Definitions. As used in these Rules, except asotherwise required by context: 
. . . . 
(3) "Contested Case" means a proceeding in which the legal
rights, duties or privileges of specific parties are
required by law to be determined after an opportunityfor Agency Hearing. 
. . . . 
(7) "Hearing" 
(i) "Agency Hearing" refers only to such hearing
held by the Commission immediately prior to a
judicial review of a contested case as provided
in Section 91-14 HRS, including but not limited
to Class IV, Use, and Variance Permits pursuantto the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance of theCounty of 
Kaua i # and other applicable laws.

Hawai#i at 200, 317 P.3d at 34 (citation and internal quotations 
omitted). 
If the statute or rule governing the activity in
question does not mandate a hearing prior to the
administrative agency's decision-making, the actions of theadministrative agency are not "required by law" and do notamount to "a final decision or order in a contested case" from which a direct appeal to circuit court is possible. 
Kaleikini, 124 Hawai# i at 17, 237 P.3d at 1083 (quoting Bush, 76 
Hawai#i at 134, 870 P.2d at 1278).
 Stated differently, "pursuant to HRS § 91–14, in order 
for proceedings before an agency to constitute a contested case 
from which an appeal can be maintained, the agency must be required by law to hold a hearing before a decision is rendered." Id. (citation omitted). Here, the Circuit Court determined that the agency hearing was required by agency rule. 
Chapter 12 of the RPPPC outlines the process for a 
petition to revoke an SMA permit. RPPPC § 1-12-2 provides who has standing to file a petition to revoke an SMA permit, and RPPPC § 1-12-3(a) outlines the contents required in a revocation petition. RPPPC § 1-12-3(a) provides, in pertinent part, that a revocation petition must contain: 
(1) the identification of the permit in question and a statement
concerning Section 1-12-2; 
(2) the specific term or condition of the permit alleged to have
been violated or not complied with; 
(3) a detailed factual basis of the alleged violation; and 
(4) any other information that the Director requires for
an adequate investigation into the matter. 
(Emphasis added). 
Upon receipt of a revocation petition, the Planning 
Director may reject it if the Planning Director determines the 
-12-NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
petition is "incomplete, inaccurate or fails to comply with the 
Rules of the [Planning] Commission." RPPPC § 1-12-3(b). 
If the Planning Director does not initially reject a 
revocation petition under RPPPC § 1-12-3(b), the "[Planning] Director shall review and investigate the basis" of said petition, and "file his report with the [Planning] Commission." RPPPC § 1-12-5. The Planning Commission "shall review the Director's report, and if the Commission finds there is reasonable cause to believe that there currently is a failure to perform according to the conditions imposed, the Commission shall issue and serve upon the party bound by the conditions [(here Kaplan)] an Order to Show Cause why the permit should not be revoked or modified." See id. (emphasis added). The Circuit Court determined that step two of the Planning Commission's review of a petition for revocation involves "holding a hearing pursuant to RPPPC § 1-12-5 to determine whether there is reasonable cause to believe that there is a failure to perform" according to the permit conditions. 
However, the plain language of RPPPC § 1-12-5 does not 
require a hearing prior to the Planning Commission's determination on whether to issue an order to show cause, and therefore, the Circuit Court's COL 19 is wrong. Only if the Planning Commission determines that there is reasonable cause to believe there is a failure to perform according to the permit's conditions will the Planning Commission issue an order to show cause and hold an agency hearing on said order. See RPPPC § 1-12-7 ("The Commission shall conduct an Agency Hearing on the 
-13-NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Order to Show Cause in accordance with the requirements of 
Chapter 6 of these Rules."). Multiple RPPPC and SMA Rules highlight that the mandatory hearing language is absent from RPPPC § 1-12-5. For example, RPPPC chapter 13, governing special permits, provides that "[t]he [Planning] Commission shall conduct an Agency Hearing within a period of sixty (60) calendar days from the date of acceptance of a properly filed and completed petition. RPPPC § 1-13-5(a) (emphasis added). Another example is SMA Rule 9.0, which states that "[t]he Planning Commission shall conduct a public hearing within a period of sixty (60) calendar days from the date of acceptance of a properly filed and completed application as determined by the Planning Department." SMA Rule 9.0(A) (emphasis added). 
No mandatory hearing requirement is stated in the text 
of RPPPC § 1-12-5. No hearing of any kind is required to be held prior to the Planning Commission's determination of whether to issue an order to show cause, making the decision to put Somers's petition on for hearing discretionary, and "discretionary hearings are not contested cases because they are not required by law." Lingle v. Haw. Gov't Emp. Ass'n Local 152, 107 
Hawai#i 
178, 184, 111 P.3d 587, 593 (2005) (citing Pele Defense Fund v. Puna Geothermal Venture, 77 Hawai# i 64, 68, 881 P.2d 1210, 1214 
(1994)). Here, the Planning Commission did not issue an order to show cause, and thus, no agency hearing, or hearing of any kind, was required by any agency rule. 
The Circuit Court, however, concluded that because (1) 
the Planning Director did not reject Somers's petition under 
-14-NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
RPPPC § 1-12-3, and (2) the Planning Commission did not determine 
that there was no reasonable cause to believe that there is a failure to perform according to the conditions imposed on the Subject Permits, that therefore (3) the Planning Commission skipped the formal process of issuing an order to show cause and denied Somers's petition during the June 25, 2019 meeting on the merits, which they could not do prior to conducting the RPPPC § 1-12-7 agency hearing. This conclusion is wrong. 
First, the Planning Commission concluded that there was 
no reasonable cause to believe the allegations in Somers's revocation petition. After hearing statements from Somers's and Kaplan's attorneys, the Planning Commission voted "to decide what to do on revocation of special management area Use Permit SMA(U)-2011-1 Class IV, Zoning Permit Z-IV-2011-1 and a Permit U-2011-1 for [Kaplan], a request for revocation." The Planning Commission voted to deny Somers's Petition for Revocation, and when asked to put forth a reason why, the Planning Commission said they "[a]gree with the analysis of the Planning Department."  The 
Planning Director's Report on Somers's Petition for Revocation 
concluded that "the Department found that there is no reasonable cause to believe that there is currently a failure to perform according to the conditions imposed." (Emphasis added). Accordingly, the Planning Commission denied Somers's Petition for Revocation for lack of reasonable cause. 
Second, the Planning Commission is tasked with 
reviewing the basis of a revocation petition when determining whether to issue an order to show cause. See RPPPC 1-12-3(a). 
-15- NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
RPPPC § 1-12-5 provides that based on the allegations in the 
petition, only if the Planning Commission finds reasonable cause to believe a term or condition in the permit is not being complied with does the Planning Commission issue an order to showcause. Therefore, if the Planning Commission determines that there is no reasonable cause, it is rejecting the petition on itsmerits. 
Lastly, the Planning Commission did not "skip" a formal
process of issuing the order to show cause, because at the June 25, 2019 regularly scheduled commission meeting,
6 all the 
commission decided was whether to issue an order to show cause. This is evidenced by the transcript of the meeting, which provides, in pertinent parts:  
  
[Planning Director] Hull: Um, at this point it's not a
contested case, so I'm not a party to the proceedings, butjust serving in capacity. If the modification -- because it has been an interpretation of the department for years,quite honestly, Counsel, that, um, a modification -- thedirector's given the discretion to determine whether or notthe public notice is necessary. 
. . . . [Commission Member] Ms. Nogami Streufert: I – I'm not sure 
it pertains to you right now. Um, I'm reading this HawaiianIslands Land Trust that we just got a few minutes ago, andthe last paragraph states that if we were to open this upto, uh -- I'm not sure it's called an intervention, becauseit -- we're not in a contested case, but if we were --but --
. . . . Mr. Hull: If it – uh, excuse me. The – the request before
you folks is a petition for revocation, um, and ultimatelythe process for revocation is you can't immediately revokethe permits today. If you are sighting towards a possiblerevocation, the Commission would essentially vote for anOrder to Show Cause, which -- which is served upon theproperty owner that was granted the permits and themodification extension, and within 30 days, that, uh, 
6 RPPPC § 1-2-2(a) provides that "Regular Meetings of the Commission
shall generally be held on the second and fourth Tuesdays of each month," andJune 25, 2019, was the fourth Tuesday in June. 
-16-NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
property owner has to demonstrate to you why these permits
should not be revoked, and then they come back -- the -- theactual property owner would come back and go through theOrder to Show Cause hearings, and then that wouldpotentially be submitted over to a contested case, i.e., ahearings officer, possibly. 
. . . . 
Mr. Hull: So -- so I think ultimately the Commission has a
couple options available for action. Uh, the Department isrecommending denial of the petition to revoke the permits.You can adopt that recommendation. You can also, um, deferthe item for possibly allowing the property owner and thepetitioner to perhaps come to some type of amenable
agreement. Or, uh, third, um, you could issue an order to
show cause, which essentially is going down the road ofrevocation but giving the, uh, uh, permit holder the noticethat -- that within 30 days, they have to get back to youfolks as to why the permit should not be revoked. Those areessentially the three options before you folks. 
(Emphasis added). 
The transcript confirms not only that the meeting on 
June 25, 2019 was not a contested case hearing, but that the 
Planning Commission was deciding whether or not to take the step to issue an order to show cause. 
Thus, because RPPPC § 1-12-5 does not mandate a hearing 
on a petition for revocation prior to the Planning Commission's decision on whether to issue an order to show cause, and the commission opted to not issue an order to show cause, not triggering the agency hearing requirement in RPPPC § 1-12-7, the June 25, 2019 meeting was not a hearing required by agency rule. 
Somers does not argue that the June 25, 2019 meeting 
was required by agency rule. Instead, Somers emphasizes that because he participated in the June 25, 2019 meeting as an adversary, a contested case occurred.  Somers cites to In re 
Application of Haw'n Elec. Co., 56 Haw. 260, 264, 535 P.2d 1102, 1105 (1975) and East Diamond Head Ass'n v. Zoning Bd. of Appeals of City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 52 Haw. 518, 524, 479 P.2d 796, 799 
-17-NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(1971), for the proposition that "a public hearing, conducted 
pursuant to public notice, was a 'contested case' within the meaning of HRS § 91-1." However, in East Diamond Head, the hearing that was held giving rise to a contested case was required by law to take place. See 52 Haw. at 520 n.2, 479 P.2d at 797 n.2. As discussed, supra, the meeting held on June 25, 2019, was discretionary, not mandatory, and East Diamond Head is inapplicable. 
In In re Hawaiian Electric Co., hearings were required 
to take place under Revised Laws of Hawai# i § 104-15 (1955),
7 
which provides, "[t]he commission shall not approve any increase in rates without conducting an advertised public hearing or hearings thereon on the island which the utility is situated." See also 56 Haw. at 268 n.5, 535 P.2d at 1108 n.5 ("The commission may, after a hearing, by order regulate, fix and change all such rates, fares, charges, classifications, rules and practices..."). In In re Hawaiian Electric Co., Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc. filed an application for a rate increase, and after the required public notice, the required hearings on the company's application took place between November 9 and 11, 1971. Id. at 261, 535 P.2d at 1103. Therefore, Somers's reliance on In re Hawaiian Electric Co., is misplaced. 
Lastly, Somers argues that this case is analogous to 
Korean Buddhist Dae Won Sa Temple of Haw. v. Sullivan, 87 Hawai# i 
217, 953 P.2d 1315 (1998) (Korean Temple), where Somers asserts 
7 Revised Laws of Hawai #i § 104-15 became HRS § 269-16 (Supp. 1974).
Id. at 268, 535 P.2d at 1108. 
-18-NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the "[supreme] court found that the hearing before the zoning 
board of appeals was. . . [an] 'agency hearing' [because] . . . [the appellant] was permitted to introduce relevant evidence and cross-examine witnesses."  In Korean Temple, appellant Temple 
filed a second variance application for a height overage with the 
Director of the Honolulu Department of Land Utilization, and public hearings were held in September and October of 1993 before a hearings officer.
8 Id. at 223, 953 P.2d at 1321. The Temple 
asserted it was entitled to a "trial-like 'contested case' hearing," but the hearings officer treated the hearings as public, allowing witnesses to testify without being subject to direct or cross-examination, and allowing the Temple to proffer rebuttal witnesses and evidence. Id. at 224, 953 P.2d at 1322. The director denied the Temple's second variance application, and the Temple appealed. Id. at 225-26, 953 P.2d at 1323-24. 
The Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA) then held a hearing
9 
on the temple's appeal, and largely affirmed the director's decision. Id. at 227-28, 953 P.2d at 1325-26. The temple appealed to the circuit court. Id. at 228, 953 P.2d at 1326. The circuit court rejected the appeal, concluding, inter alia, that the Hawai# i Administrative Procedure Act (HAPA) did not 
require the director to hold a contested case hearing on the variance application, and instead the contested case occurred 
8 Pursuant to the Revised Charter of the City and County of Honolulu
(RCCCH), "prior to the granting of any variance, the director shall hold a
public hearing thereon." RCCCH Section 6-910(3) (1990 ed.). Thus, the
hearings before the hearings officer were required by law. 
9 The ZBA stated that it considered the hearing a contested case
hearing. Id. at 227, 953 P.2d at 1325. 
-19-NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
during the ZBA proceeding. Id. at 228, 953 P.2d at 1326. The 
temple appealed. Id. at 229, 953 P.2d at 1327. 
The supreme court determined that the ZBA's practice of 
hearing appeals from the director's decisions regarding variance applications was without authorization because the 1993 amendments to the RCCCH were intended to take that power away from the board. See id. at 237-39, 953 P.2d at 1335-37. The supreme court then appears to conclude that the hearing before the zoning board was a contested case, at least in part, because the Temple was permitted to freely introduce evidence (including rebuttal evidence) before the hearings officer (which was in the record before the zoning board), was permitted to introduce evidence before the zoning board relevant to the board's inquiry of whether the director abused his discretion, and the Temple was accorded the right to call and cross-examine witnesses before the zoning board. Id. at 239-40, 953 P.2d at 1337-38. 
The facts in the case before us are not analogous to 
those in Korean Temple. First, here, the Planning Commission stated that the June 25, 2019 meeting was not a contested case, and the parties did not dispute that it was not a contested case, 
whereas the ZBA in Korean Temple explicitly informed the parties 
that the hearing was a contested case. Id. at 227, 953 P.2d at 1325. 
Second, in Korean Temple, the temple was allowed to put 
forward an extraordinary amount of evidence (including rebuttal evidence) before the hearings officer, introduce evidence relevant to the zoning board's inquiry, and conduct extensive 
-20-NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
examination and cross-examination of witnesses. Id. at 240, 953 
P.2d at 1338. Here, the Planning Director's report prior to the June 25, 2019 meeting says that the "entire record" should be considered, including public testimony, any government agency comments, and Somers's response to the Planning Director's report. Neither party offered evidence, called witnesses, or cross-examined witnesses, and besides statements from the parties' representatives and a recap of the Planning Director's report, no testimony was received. 
Lastly, pursuant to RCCCH § 6-910(3), the director was 
required to hold a public hearing prior to granting the Temple's variance request. Although the supreme court determined that the agency hearing was the hearing on appeal before the ZBA, a hearing was, nevertheless, required by law to occur before the director ruled on the Temple's variance request. This distinguishes Korean Temple from the case before us, as no hearing is required before the Planning Commission rejects a petition for revocation. 
The cases relied on by Somers to support a finding of a 
contested case either demonstrate why the July 25, 2019 meeting was not a contested case hearing, or are otherwise distinguishable and do not offer support. The Planning Commission meeting was not required by agency rule to take place, and the Planning Commission has the authority to reject a revocation petition when deciding whether to issue an order to show cause without holding a contested case hearing. Therefore, 
-21-NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the June 25, 2019 meeting was discretionary, not mandatory, and 
not a contested case hearing. 
2. Was there a determination of the rights, duties,
or privileges of the parties? 
Even assuming, arguendo, that the June 25, 2019 meeting 
on Somers's Petition for Revocation was required by law, it would not have determined the rights, duties, or privileges of the parties. At the June 25, 2019 meeting, the Planning Commission was considering whether to issue an order to show cause, and such consideration does not determine the rights, duties, or privileges of the parties. See Kaniakapupu, 111 
Hawai#i at 133-
34, 139 P.3d at 721-22. 
In Kaniakapupu, on February 1, 1989, Myers petitioned 
the State Land Use Commission (LUC) to amend the land use 
district boundary for approximately 9.917 acres in an area known 
as Nu#uana in Honolulu (the Myers Parcel) from "Conservation Land 
Use District Boundary" to "Urban Land Use District Boundary." Id. at 125-26, 139 P.3d at 713-14. The LUC approved the reclassification in November 1989 subject to certain conditions. Id. at 126, 139 P.3d at 714. 
In 2000, the Hui was formed "to care for and serve as a 
steward of Kaniakapupu," which "is located on property owned by the State that shares a common boundary with . . . the [Myers] parcel." Id. On April 21, 2003, the Hui filed a motion for an order to show cause, pursuant to Hawai# i Administrative Rules 
(
HAR) §§ 15–15-70 and 15-15-93, seeking to have the LUC issue an 
order to show cause why the classification of the Myers Parcel 
-22-NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
should not be reverted back to a conservation district.10 Id. at 
127, 139 P.3d at 715. 
The LUC held a hearing on the Hui's motion 
for an order to show cause, and orally voted to deny the motion 
on the basis "that the Hui had not met its burden of demonstrating a failure to perform a condition, representation, or commitment on the part of Myers." Id. at 128, 139 P.3d at 716. On appeal, the circuit court determined that the LUC did not hold a contested case hearing, and only if the motion for an order to show cause had been granted would a contested case hearing have been required. Id. at 131, 139 P.3d at 719. 
The supreme court affirmed the circuit court's 
conclusion that no contested case occurred, determining that the hearing on whether to issue an order to show cause did not determine the rights, duties, or privileges of the parties. See id. at 133-34, 139 P.3d at 721-22. Specifically, the supreme court concluded that: 
If the LUC had determined that it "ha[d] reason to believe
that there had been a failure to perform according to theconditions imposed, or the representations and commitmentsmade by [Myers]," then the LUC would have issued an "orderto show cause why the property should not revert to itsformer land use classification or be changed to a moreappropriate classification[ ]" to Myers. HAR § 15–15–93(b).In other words, the only determination the LUC was requiredto make when hearing the instant motion for an order to showcause was whether it had reason to believe that Myers hadfailed to perform (1) according to the conditions imposed bythe November 1989 order or (2) any representations orcommitments made that led to the November 1989 order. As such, the LUC was not required to—and, therefore, didnot—determine the Hui's rights and privileges to protecttheir native Hawaiian cultural and traditional practices atKaniakapupu. 
Id. 
10 The Hui asserted, inter alia , that Myers violated a condition in
the November 1989 approval order.  Id. at 127, 139 P.3d at 715. 
-23
-NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The supreme court continued, stating that "the Hui's 
motion for an order to show cause was essentially a threshold 
motion or procedural vehicle to obtain a show cause hearing in order for the LUC to determine the rights, duties, or privileges of specific parties." Id. at 134, 139 P.3d at 722. 
Here, what the Planning Commission was deciding during 
the June 25, 2019 meeting is nearly identical to the circumstances in Kaniakapupu. If the Planning Commission had determined there was reasonable cause to believe Kaplan had failed to perform according to the conditions of the Subject Permits, the Planning Commission would have issued an order to show cause why the Subject Permits should not be revoked. Like Kaniakapupu, the Planning Commission was only required to determine whether it had reason to believe Kaplan was in violation of the Subject Permits, and was not required to make any determinations on whether Kaplan's plans affect Somers's conservation easements, nor whether Hendrikus or Kaplan had failed to perform according to the conditions in the Subject Permits, i.e., the rights, privileges, or duties with respect to the land in question. 
Therefore, the June 25, 2019 meeting was not a 
contested case hearing for the purposes of obtaining judicial review pursuant to HRS § 91-14(a) because it was not required by law and it did not determine the rights, privileges, or duties of 
-24-NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the parties, and the Circuit Court erred in exercising 
jurisdiction over Somers's appeal.11  
V. CONCLUSION 
Based on the above, we decline to reach the other 
points of error raised by West Sunset and the County. The Circuit Court's July 17, 2020 Judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded to the Circuit Court for dismissal of Somers's appeal from the Planning Commission for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. 
In addition, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Kaplan's May 30, 
2024 motion for retention of oral argument is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, December 10, 2024.

11 The Circuit Court additionally found that it has jurisdiction over
Somer's administrative appeal pursuant to SMA Rule 15.0 and RPPPC 1-6-18(i).  
However, RPPPC Rule 1-6-18(i) is found in the section of the RPPPC that dealswith appeals from agency hearings (contested cases), and likewise, SMA Rule15.0 allows for "[a]ny party to the agency hearing pursuant [to] Chapter 6 ofthe [RPPPC]" to appeal. Thus, because there has been no agency hearing forwhich an appeal is proper, RPPPC § 1-6-18(i) and SMA Rule 15.0 do not giveSomers an additional basis to appeal the decision.
