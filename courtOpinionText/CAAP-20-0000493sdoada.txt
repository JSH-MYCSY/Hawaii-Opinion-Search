A
PPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
KONA DIVISION 
(CIVIL NO. 3DSS-20-0000313) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Wadsworth and Nakasone, JJ.) 
Respondent-Appellant Seth Muller (Muller
) appeals from 
the July 8, 2020 Order Granting Petition for Injunction Against 
Harassment, filed by the District Court of the Third Circuit, Kona Division (District Court).
1 
On appeal, Muller contends the District Court erred by 
granting the Petition for Injunction Against Harassment because there was not clear and convincing evidence he committed "Physical harm, bodily injury, assault, or the threat of imminent physical harm, bodily injury, or assault," that constitutes harassment under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 604-10.5.

restrain harassment," states in part:

Upon careful review of the record and the brief 
submitted and having given due consideration to the arguments 
advanced and the issues raised, we resolve Muller's point of error as follows, and affirm. 3
"Whether there was substantial evidence to support an 
injunction" under HRS § 604-10.5 "is reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard." Duarte v. Young, 134 Hawai# i 459, 462, 342 
P.3d 878, 881 (App. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). A clear and convincing standard of proof applies to establish "harassment" warranting an injunction. HRS § 604-10.5(g). 
(a) For the purposes of this section: 
"Course of conduct" means a pattern of conduct
composed of a series of acts over any period oftime evidencing a continuity of purpose. 
"Harassment" means: (1) Physical harm, bodily injury, assault, or
the threat of imminent physical harm, bodily
injury, or assault; or 
(2) An intentional or knowing course of conduct
directed at an individual that seriously alarms
or disturbs consistently or continually bothersthe individual and serves no legitimate purpose;provided that such course of conduct would causea reasonable person to suffer emotionaldistress. 
(b) The district courts shall have the power to enjoin,
prohibit, or temporarily restrain harassment. 
. . . . (g) . . . . 
If the court finds by clear and convincing
evidence that harassment as defined in paragraph (1) of that
definition exists, it may enjoin for no more than threeyears further harassment of the petitioner, or thatharassment as defined in paragraph (2) of that definitionexists, it shall enjoin for no more than three years furtherharassment of the petitioner, including, in the case whereany party is enjoined from harassing a minor, for a periodextending to a date after the minor has reached eighteenyears of age; provided that this subsection shall notprohibit the court from issuing other injunctions againstthe named parties even if the time to which the injunctionapplies exceeds a total of three years.

When reviewing a finding that a fact has been proved by
clear and convincing evidence, the question before theappellate court is whether the record as a whole containssubstantial evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could have found it highly probable that the fact was true.In conducting its review, the court must view the record inthe light most favorable to the prevailing party below andgive appropriate deference to how the trier of fact may haveevaluated the credibility of witnesses, resolved conflictsin the evidence, and drawn reasonable inferences from theevidence. 
Matter of JK, 149 Hawai# i 400, 409-10, 491 P.3d 1179, 1188-89 
(App. 2021) (quoting Conservatorship of O.B., 470 P.3d 41, 55 
(Cal. 2020)) (bolding and italics omitted). 
Here, Muller testified that on April 16, 2020, while 
having an argument with RM, the 14-year-old son of Muller's girlfriend for whom Muller was providing homework assistance, Muller gave RM a "bear hug" and moved RM about one or two feet from where RM was going, back to a kitchen table. It was clear to Muller that RM wanted to leave, and Muller was trying to redirect him. Muller admitted holding RM against his will to redirect him. RM testified that as RM attempted to go to his room, Muller grabbed his hand, and it was "sore" when RM was grabbed by the arm. 
"In general, it is for the trial judge as fact-finder 
to assess the credibility of witnesses and to resolve all questions of fact; the judge may accept or reject any witness's testimony in whole or in part." Duarte, 134 Hawai# i at 464, 342 
P.3d at 883 (internal quotation marks, brackets, and citation omitted). 
The District Court found that Muller's conduct of 
grabbing RM to place RM in a bear hug during the course of an argument about RM's homework performance "caus[ed] pain to R.M.'s arm," and established harassment by "physical harm or bodily injury" under its definition in HRS § 604-10.5(a).

4 The District Court ruled as follows: 
But I do find this, based upon the facts, that
harassment as defined in Subsection 604-10.5 A-1 [sic],
specifically physical harm or bodily injury. And that is that in response to a disagreement regarding the performance-- the method of performance of homework by the minor, R.M.,
(continued...) 
3 4(...continued)NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
testimony that it was "sore" when Muller grabbed RM constitutes 
substantial evidence from which the District Court could find that it was "highly probable" that the fact that RM felt pain was true. JK, 149 Hawai# i at 409, 491 P.3d at 1188. The District 
Court, as the factfinder, evaluated the credibility of Muller and RM, resolved the questions of fact, and drew reasonable inferences from the evidence to support its conclusion that the standard to issue the injunction had been met. See id. at 410, 
491 P.3d at 1189; Duarte, 134 Hawai# i at 462, 342 P.3d at 881. 
Viewed in the light most favorable to Martinez, the prevailing party, there was substantial evidence to support the District Court's issuance of an injunction against harassment by Muller for grabbing or performing a "bear hug" on RM, which constituted physical harm or bodily injury under the definition of "harassment" in HRS § 604-10.5(a). See JK, 149 Hawai# i at 409-
10, 491 P.3d at 1188-89. 
Relying on Duarte, Muller claims there must be evidence 
that he intended to cause physical harm, bodily injury, or assault and that there was no clear and convincing evidence he intended to harm RM. In Duarte, this court considered, inter alia, whether in a dispute between neighbors, the respondent's act of yelling the insult "Fuck you, Hawaiian bitch" to the petitioner, constituted a "threat of imminent physical harm, bodily injury, or assault" under the paragraph (1) definition of "harassment" in HRS § 604-10.5(a). 134 Hawai# i at 462-64, 342 
P.3d at 881-83. 
Noting that this definition of "harassment" did 
not define "threat
 of imminent physical harm, bodily injury, or 
assault," this court utilized the ordinary meaning of threat as "[a] communicated intent to inflict harm or loss on another[.]" Id. at 464, 342 P.3d at 883 (emphasis added). The definition of "threat" is inapplicable here, as this case involves a finding of physical harm or bodily injury, instead of a threat. 
the respondent grabbed him in a bear hug after pulling him
back and causing pain to R.M.'s arm.

Based on Duarte, Muller also urges an application of an 
objective reasonable person standard to determine "harassment" 
under HRS § 604-10.5(a) involving physical harm, bodily injury, or assault. The plain language of HRS § 604-10.5 requires the trial court to find "harassment" by clear and convincing evidence -- not an objective standard. HRS § 604-10.5(g). The "objective test" from Duarte only applies to determine whether a threat was communicated.
5 134 Hawai# i at 464-65, 342 P.3d at 883-84. This 
case did not involve a threat. 
Muller also cites the lack of obvious or lingering 
physical injury such as swelling, bruising, lumps, cuts or lacerations, redness or marks, and a complaint of pain either at the time of the incident or thereafter, and notes that RM was merely "sore," which the District Court equated with pain. "Harassment" means "[p]hysical harm, bodily injury . . . ." HRS § 604-10.5(a) (emphasis added). A witness's testimony of feeling "sore" after being grabbed is sufficient to establish physical pain, and thus, the element of "bodily injury" in harassment. Cf. In the Interest of Doe, 79 Hawai# i 265, 279, 900 P.2d 1332, 
1346 (App. 1995) (holding in a juvenile proceeding that a witness's testimony of feeling "'sore' after being struck by the Appellant was sufficient to establish 'physical pain' and thus, the element of 'bodily injury' in a charge of assault."). We conclude that the District Court did not err by finding that RM's 
5 Because the word "threat" was not defined in HRS § 604-10.5, this
court looked at legislative history and extrinsic aids such as dictionaries to
determine its meaning, to conclude that: 
Therefore, a "threat of imminent physical harm, bodilyinjury, or assault" means that an alleged harasser's conductexpressly or impliedly communicates an intent to physicallyharm, cause bodily injury, or assault another personimminently. This is an objective test. Under this objective standard, we are required to determine whether areasonable person would believe the conduct of Youngcommunicated an intent to physically harm, cause bodilyinjury, or assault Duarte imminently so as to meet thedefinition of harassment under paragraph (1).

testimony that he felt "sore" constituted pain. See Doe, 79 
Hawai# i at 279, 900 P.2d at 1346. 
For the foregoing reasons, the July 8, 2020 Order 
Granting Petition for Injunction Against Harassment, filed by the 
District Court of the Third Circuit, Kona Division, is affirmed.
