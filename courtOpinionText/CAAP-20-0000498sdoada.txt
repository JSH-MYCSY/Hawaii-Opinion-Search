JOEL SHAWN RAND, Plaintiff-Appellant/Cross-Appellee, v.
KEHAULANI MUNOS RAND, now known as KEHAULANI MUNOS,
Defendant-Appellee/Cross-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(FC-D NO. 11-1-0371) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: 
Leonard, Acting C.J., and Wadsworth and Nakasone, JJ.) 
This appeal arises out of divorce proceedings between 
Plaintiff-Appellant/Cross-Appellee Joel Shawn Rand (Joel
) and 
Defendant-Appellee/Cross-Appellant Kehaulani Munos Rand, now 
known as Kehaulani Munos (Kehau). Joel appeals from the 
following orders entered by the Family Court of the Second 
Circuit (Family Court):1/ (1) the June 22, 2020 "Findings of Fact 
and Conclusions of Law" (FOFs/COLs); and (2) the July 22, 2020 
"Stipulated Order Re: [Kehau's] Motion for Reconsideration, or to 
Alter, Amend and/or Correct Clerical Error in Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and Order Filed 6/22/2020" (the Stipulated
Order).
2/ 
On July 7, 2011, Joel filed a complaint for divorce 
against Kehau. After a trial, on June 5, 2012, the Family Court 
entered a Divorce Judgment (Judgment), which, among other things, 
1/ The Honorable Michelle L. Drewyer presided. 
2/ On January 28, 2021, this court entered an order approving the
parties' stipulation to dismiss Kehau's cross-appeal.   
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
granted Joel a divorce, ordered Joel to pay Kehau alimony of 
$1,000 per month for a period of one year, and ordered Kehau to pay Joel an equalization payment in the amount of $45,380.89 "for the division of the parties['] marital estate." Kehau appealed. 
In a summary disposition order, we vacated the Judgment 
in part and remanded for proceedings consistent with the order. See Rand v. Rand, No. CAAP-12-0000555, 2016 WL 383158, at *11 (Haw. App. Jan. 29, 2016). As relevant here, we vacated the Family Court's determination that Kehau must pay a $45,380.89 equalization payment to Joel because: (a) the Family Court should have valued the parties' marital assets as of the date of the conclusion of the evidentiary part of trial (DOCOEPOT); and 
(b) the Family Court erred by charging the marital estate with 
the debts under Joel's Morgan Stanley Smith Barney (MSSB
3/) 
promissory notes without offsetting those notes with the payments MSSB had agreed to make under the bonus agreements between Joel and MSSB. Id. at *6-*7. We also vacated the Family Court's alimony award, directing that "the issue on remand should be limited to whether or not $1,000 per month was, as Kehau claims, insufficient." Id. at *11. 
Following a trial on remand, the Family Court issued 
the FOFs/COLs, concluding in part that Joel owed Kehau a remaining equalization payment in the amount of $149,375 (theEqualization Payment
), and additional alimony in the amount of 
$23,200. The court also ordered Joel to pay prejudgment interest to Kehau on the Equalization Payment amount at the rate of 10% per year from February 21, 2012 (the DOCOEPOT) through June 22, 2020 (the date of entry of the FOFs/COLs).
4/ 
On appeal, Joel contends that the Family Court erred in 
concluding that: (1) Kehau was entitled to prejudgment interest on the Equalization Payment for the period from February 21, 2012, to June 22, 2020; (2) there should be no reduction in the 
3/ MSSB was Joel's employer. The parties and the Family Court appear
to have used the names Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, or MSSB, and Morgan
Stanley interchangeably. For convenience, we use the acronym MSSB to refer toMorgan Stanley Smith Barney and all relevant associated entities. 
4/ On July 22, 2020, the Family Court entered the Stipulated Order,
which corrected a clerical error in the FOFs/COLs. 
2  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Equalization Payment as a result of Joel's final debt payment to 
MSSB, and his tax payments on the payments he received from MSSB, after the divorce; and (3) Kehau was entitled to additional alimony in the amount of $23,200.00. 
After reviewing the record on appeal and the relevant 
legal authorities, and giving due consideration to the issues raised and the arguments advanced by the parties, we resolve Joel's contentions as follows, and affirm. 
(1) Joel contends that the Family Court erroneously 
concluded that Kehau was entitled to prejudgment interest on the Equalization Payment, from February 21, 2012 (the DOCOEPOT). Relatedly, Joel challenges COLs 29 through 31. 
The Family Court invoked HRS §§ 478-2 and 636-16/ in 
awarding Kehau prejudgment interest on the Equalization Payment. The court reasoned: 5
28. In Roxas v. Marcos, 89 Haw. [] 91, 969 P.2d 1209
(1998), the Hawaii Supreme Court made clear that prejudgment
interest is "compensatory in nature," and that the clear"implication in this court's oftrepeated characterization ofprejudgment interest as 'compensatory' is that the award ismeant to make the plaintiff whole with respect to delay inreceiving damages to which he or she is entitled. The foregoing is the functional equivalent of the notion thatprejudgment interest is designed to afford the plaintiff theapproximate investment value of the damage award, which lawpresumes the defendant has acquired as a windfall." [Id.] at155, 969 P.2d at 1273. 
29. Although the law presumes that Joel acquired a
windfall from the fact that he did not have to pay theequalization payment he owes Kehau to her from February 21,2012 to the present, the likelihood of a windfall in thiscase is even stronger, in view of the fact that Joel, whohas held Kehau's equalization payment for the past eightyears, is a professional investment and wealth managementadvisor who is regularly engaged in the industry offinancial investing and advisement. 
5/   HRS § 478-2 (2008) states, in relevant part: "When there is no 
express written contract fixing a different rate of interest, interest shallbe allowed at the rate of ten per cent a year . . . ." 
HRS § 636-16 (2016) states: 
In awarding interest in civil cases, the judge is
authorized to designate the commencement date to conformwith the circumstances of each case, provided that theearliest commencement date in cases arising in tort, may bethe date when the injury first occurred and in cases arisingby breach of contract, it may be the date when the breachfirst occurred. 
3  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
30. Based on the foregoing, the Court concludes that
an order awarding Kehau prejudgment interest from Joel on
the $149,375 equalization payment owed in this case would befair to approximate the investment value of the award, andto avoid a presumed windfall to Joel arising out of hisholding of such moneys[sic] from the DOCOEPOT to thepresent. 
31. It is just and equitable in this case, and this
Court hereby concludes that prejudgment interest to Kehau onthe sum of $149,375 at the statutory rate of ten percent perannum from February 21, 2012 (the DOCOEPOT) through andincluding the date of the entry of the Court's instantFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order, isappropriate in this case. 
Joel argues that the Roxas ruling on prejudgment 
interest does not apply to "property division matters in divorce 
cases[,]" which are decided under marital partnership principles, and that unlike a contract or tort case, "there is no consideration of fault and there are no damages or compensation to either party when the Family Court divides the marital estate . . . ." Joel also points to FOF 14, in which the Family Court found that Joel "did not request or cause any significant delay in the appeal or remand proceedings." 
HRS § 636-16 provides that "[i]n awarding interest in 
civil cases, the judge is authorized to designate the commencement date to conform with the circumstances of each case . . . ." (Emphasis added.) See County of Hawai# i v. C & J Coupe 
Family Ltd., 124 Hawai# i 281, 311, 242 P.3d 1136, 1166 (2010) 
("HRS § 636–16, which applies in all civil cases, vests a court with discretion to award prejudgment interest." (emphasis added)). This divorce case is a civil case. Nothing in the plain language of HRS § 636-16 limits the discretion of the family court in a case such as this to award prejudgment interest, or otherwise requires a damages award as a prerequisite to a prejudgment interest award. 
Similarly, the purpose of prejudgment interest does not 
suggest such a limitation on the family court's discretion. See 
id. ("[T]he purpose of prejudgment interest, in the context of HRS § 636–16, is to correct injustice when a judgment is delayed for a long period of time for any reason, including litigation delays, . . . and to permit more equitable results and to more speedily resolve cases[.]" (first quoting

Co., 74 Haw. 85, 137, 839 P.2d 10, 36 (1992) ("The purpose of [HRS § 636–16] . . . is to allow the court to designate the commencement date of interest in order to correct injustice when a judgment is delayed for a long period of time for any reason, including litigation delays." (quoting Schmidt v. The Bd. of Dirs. of The Ass'n of Apartment Owners of The Marco Polo Apartments, 73 Haw. 526, 534, 836 P.2d 479, 483 (1992)) (original brackets and internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added)); see also Morris v. Morris, 724 P.2d 527, 530 (Alaska 1986) (noting that the purposes behind prejudgment interest are applicable in divorce proceedings and holding that a trial court may, in its discretion, award prejudgment interest in such proceedings). 
Here, the Family Court awarded Kehau prejudgment 
interest on the Equalization Payment from the DOCOEPOT, i.e., the date used to value the marital property. As Kehau points out, she was denied this money (and any interest on it) for the eight years between the parties' divorce and the Family Court's final property division order. The Family Court reasoned that the prejudgment interest award "would be fair to approximate the investment value of the award, and to avoid a presumed windfall to Joel arising out of his holding of such moneys[sic] from the DOCOEPOT to the present." See HRS § 636-16 (authorizing the 
trial court to designate the commencement date for prejudgment interest based on "the circumstances of each case"); Morris, 724 P.2d at 530 (ruling that "[u]nder the circumstances of this case," wife's share of the marital estate became "due" on the date the trial court chose to value the parties' property). In these circumstances, we cannot say that the Family court abused its discretion in awarding prejudgment interest for the period from February 21, 2012, to June 22, 2020. COLs 29 through 31, which present mixed determinations of fact and law, are not clearly erroneous. 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2) Joel contends that the Family Court erroneously 
concluded that there should be no reduction in the Equalization 
Payment as a result of the following payments made by Joel after the divorce: (a) the final debt payment to MSSB under the MSSB promissory notes; and (b) tax payments on monies received from MSSB under the related MSSB bonus and retention agreements. Relatedly, Joel challenges COLs 21 and 22. 
The MSSB promissory notes were part of a bonus 
structure in which MSSB paid monies to Joel in lump sums on the condition that Joel execute the notes in the amount of those sums. Each year that Joel remained employed with MSSB, he would pay back a portion of the promissory notes with interest. MSSB would then pay him back that amount, and Joel would then owe taxes on the repayment from MSSB. 
The Family Court found, and Joel does not dispute, 
that: (1) on March 18, 2016, Joel resigned from MSSB to start his own business with two partners – for reasons unrelated to his divorce from Kehau; (2) after Joel left MSSB, he stopped receiving the payments he had been receiving from MSSB under the bonus and retention agreements, and also had to pay, on an accelerated basis, the full principal amounts that were due and owing under the promissory notes; (3) on May 24, 2016, Joel paid MSSB the sum of $104,316.00, thereby satisfying all of his note obligations to MSSB, including the two note obligations (under which Joel still owed $72,767.12 and $3,936.05) incurred during the parties' marriage; (4) after the parties' divorce, Joel paid a total of $45,809.52 in income taxes on the payments he received under the bonus and retention agreements; (5) Joel's decision to leave MSSB and form his own business was voluntary, and was made with his business partners; and (6) Joel was aware that terminating his employment with MSSB would result in some "financial pain," including the accelerated repayment of the promissory notes, but decided on balance that the benefits of this professional move outweighed the burdens. 
Based on these findings, the Family Court denied Joel's 
request to reduce the Equalization Payment based on his post-divorce debt and tax payments. The Family Court reasoned in 
6  
  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
part: 
21. [Joel's] claim for a reduction of his
equalization payment owed to [Kehau] to account for
$3,936.05 and $72,767.12 for the MSSB Promissory Noteobligations that became due in 5/2016, and his payment ofincome taxes on bonus and retention payments that hereceived from 2012 through 2016 is denied. 
22. Based on the foregoing, this Court concludes
that Joel owed Kehau an equalization payment in the sum of$164,375. Against this sum, Joel is entitled to a $15,000credit representing the amount advanced by Joel to Kehau forattorney's fees ordered in response to Kehau's motion foradvance of attorney's fees filed herein on 10/20/2017.Accordingly, the remaining equalization payment owed by Joelto Kehau is $149,375. 
Under Hawai# i case law, the DOCOEPOT is the date on 
which marital assets should be valued for property division in a 
divorce. See, e.g., LaPeter v. LaPeter, 144 Hawai# i 295, 306, 
439 P.3d 247, 258 (App. 2019). Joel cites no authority supporting what is essentially a request to value certain debts and assets, 
i.e., the marital estate's debts under the MSSB 
promissory notes and its expected future payments under the MSSB bonus and retention agreements, based on voluntary actions taken by one of the divorced parties several years after the DOCOEPOT. The Family Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Joel's request to reduce the Equalization Payment to account for the economic consequences of professional and financial decisions that Joel voluntarily made for himself (and not Kehau) four years after the parties' divorce. COLs 21 and 22, which present mixed determinations of fact and law, are not clearly erroneous. 
(3) Joel contends that the Family Court erroneously 
concluded that Kehau was entitled to additional alimony in the amount of $23,200.00
. More specifically, he argues that Kehau's 
January 18, 2012 Income and Expense Statement included expenses for her child from a previous relationship whom Joel had no obligation to support. Relatedly, Joel challenges, COLs 37, 39, 40 and 41.
6/ 
6/ COLs 37, 39, 40 and 41 state: 
37. Contrary to Joel's assertion at trial, this
Court concludes that none of the alimony awarded to Kehau in
this case would constitute support of Kehau's child at that
(continued...) 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Family Court made extensive, detailed findings 
supporting its additional alimony award. Although Joel summarily 
challenges FOFs 88, 89.a.iv., 89.b.i., 89d.i., and 89d.ii., he presents no discernible argument as to why any of them, except FOF 89.a.iv., is clearly erroneous. "This court is not obliged to address matters for which the appellant[] ha[s] failed to present discernible arguments." Hussey v. Say, 139 Hawai# i 181, 
191, 384 P.3d 1282, 1292 (2016) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Exotics 
Hawai#i-Kona, Inc. v. E.I. Du Pont De 
Nemours & Co., 116 Hawai# i 277, 288, 172 P.3d 1021, 1032 (2007)); 
see HRAP Rule 28(b)(7). 
FOF 89.a.iv. states: 
Although [Joel] argues that [Kehau's] post-divorce shortfall
of $2,934 per month should be reduced because [Kehau's]budget includes expenses for her minor child, the evidencewas undisputed that none of [Kehau's] $2,934 shortfall isattributable to [Kehau's] minor child, since the portion of[Kehau's] budget that is allocated to the child's expenses($1,145) is more than offset by the income that [Kehau]received from the child's child support and social securityincome ($1,311). 
Joel argues that Kehau's January 18, 2012 Income and 
Expense Statement does not support this FOF because "clearly a 
portion of the housing expenses ($2,535.00) and transportation 
6/ (...continued)
time, since the portion of Kehau's budget that was allocated
to the child's expenses ($1,145) was more than offset by theincome that Kehau received from the child's child supportand social security income ($1,311). 
. . . . 
39. This Court concludes that Kehau had an unmet need 
over and above her income each month in the sum of $2,934per month, that she was unable to meet her own reasonableneeds, and that Joel was able to meet his own needs (as hetestified at trial) at the standard of living establishedduring the marriage, as well as meet Kehau's unmet need. 
40. Pursuant to the Court's Divorce Decree, Joel paid
$1,000 per month towards Kehau's unmet monthly need of$2,934 per month, leaving Kehau with a remaining unmet needin the sum of $1,934 per month. 
41. Having reviewed the evidence in this case, and
the statutory factors set forth in HRS Section 580-47(a),this Court concludes that it is fair and equitable to awardKehau additional alimony from Joel in the sum of $1,934 permonth times 12 months, for a total additional alimony awardof $23,200 payable from Joel to Kehau. 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
expenses ($410.00) reported . . . had to be attributable to the 
child." He cites no evidence in the record to support this assertion. 
Based on our review of the record, we conclude that FOF 
89.a.iv. is not clearly erroneous. We further conclude that COLs 37, 39, 40 and 41, which present mixed determinations of fact and law, are not clearly erroneous, and the Family Court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Kehau was entitled to additional alimony in the amount of $23,200.00. 
For the reasons discussed above, the June 22, 2020 
"Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law" and the July 22, 2020 "Stipulated Order Re: Defendant's Motion for Reconsideration, or to Alter, Amend and/or Correct Clerical Error in Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and Order Filed 6/22/2020," both entered by the Family Court of the Second Circuit, are affirmed.
