SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Wadsworth and McCullen, JJ.) 
Defendant/Counterclaim Plaintiff-Appellant Laurie Ann 
Bass appeals from the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit's 
August 3, 2020 "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order   
 
 
  
 
   
 
    
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
   
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and 
Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure" and Judgment.1 
On appeal, Bass contends the circuit court erred in 
dismissing her wrongful foreclosure counterclaim and granting a 
foreclosure decree in favor of Plaintiff/Counterclaim Defendant-
Appellee Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, as Trustee for 
Argent Securities Inc., Asset Backed Pass-Through Certificates, 
Series 2006-M1, Under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement Dated 
June 1, 2006. She argues Deutsche Bank failed to prove it (1) had standing to foreclose and (2) properly gave notice of 
default.

"An award of summary judgment is reviewed de novo and 
is appropriate where there is no genuine issue as to the 
material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a 
matter of law." U.S. Bank N.A. v. Mattos, 140 Hawai‘ i 26, 30, 
398 P.3d 615, 619 (2017) (citations and internal quotation marks 
omitted). 
1 The Honorable Henry T. Nakamoto presided. 
2 Bass also raises points of error related to the authentication of 
records and certain findings and conclusions. 
Bass contends Deutsche Bank failed to properly authenticate the 
business records on which it relies. However, except as otherwise provided 
herein, after reviewing the record, we conclude there was no error. 
Bass challenges Findings of Fact (FOF) 5, 6, and 11, and conclusions of 
law (COL) 3- 6, 8, 9, 11, and 13. Based on our decision below, FOF 6 (a mixed 
question of law and fact) and FOF 11 were clearly erroneous. COL 3-5, 8, 9, 
11, and 13 were wrong, and a challenge to COL 6 was waived.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve the 
points of error as discussed below, and vacate and remand. 
(1) Bass first contends Deutsche Bank failed to show 
it had standing to bring the foreclosure action because it did 
not establish it was the holder of the March 31, 2006 Adjustable 
Rate Note, non-holder of the Note, or had "rightful possession" 
of the Note when the Note was lost. 
To establish standing to foreclose, the "plaintiff 
must necessarily prove its entitlement to enforce the note as it is the default on the note that gives rise to the action." Bank
of Am., N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 139 
Hawaiʻi 361, 368, 390 P.3d 
1248, 1255 (2017). "Whether a party is entitled to enforce a 
promissory note is determined by application of [Hawaii ‘ Revised 
Statutes (HRS)] § 490:3-301." Id. at 369, 390 P.3d at 1256. 
HRS § 490:3-301 (2008) explains who is entitled to 
enforce an instrument: 
"Person entitled to enforce" an instrument means (i) the 
holder of the instrument, (ii) a nonholder in possession of 
the instrument who has the rights of a holder, or (iii) a 
person not in possession of the instrument who is entitled to enforce the instrument pursuant to section 490:3- 309 or 
490:3-418(d).  
Related, HRS § 490:3-309 (2008) governs enforcement of a lost 
instrument: 
3   
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(a) A person not in possession of an instrument is 
entitled to enforce the instrument if (i) the person was in 
rightful possession of the instrument and entitled to 
enforce it when loss of possession occurred, (ii) the loss 
of possession was not the result of a transfer by the 
person or a lawful seizure, and (iii) the person cannot 
reasonably obtain possession of the instrument because the instrument was destroyed, its whereabouts cannot be 
determined, or it is in the wrongful possession of an 
unknown person or a person that cannot be found or is not 
amenable to service of process. 
(b) A person seeking enforcement of an instrument 
under subsection (a) must prove the terms of the instrument 
and the person's right to enforce the instrument. If that 
proof is made, section 490:3- 308 applies to the case as if 
the person seeking enforcement had produced the instrument. 
The court may not enter judgment in favor of the person 
seeking enforcement unless it finds that the person 
required to pay the instrument is adequately protected 
against loss that might occur by reason of a claim by 
another person to enforce the instrument. Adequate protection may be provided by any reasonable means. 
(Emphases added.) 
To summarize, Deutsche Bank must prove that when it 
lost possession of the Note: (1) it was validly assigned 
ownership of the Note, and (2) the Note was physically delivered 
to it for the purpose of giving it the right to enforce the 
Note. 
Based on this record, the circuit court could 
determine that ownership of the Note was transferred to Argent  
Securities, Inc. and assigned to Deutsche Bank as trustee of the 
mortgage pool, and the Note was to be physically delivered to 
Argent or its designee, i.e., Deutsche Bank, for the purpose of 
giving it the right to enforce the Note.  
As to physical possession, Deutsche Bank relies solely 
on the declaration of Gina Feezer, which stated "[t]he Original 
4   
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Note was received by Deutsche Bank as Trustee on May 20, 2006 
which maintained possession and custody of the Original Note 
until January 3, 2011. At that time the Original Note was 
released to . . . the servicer at that time," "the history of 
the custody of the Note shows that the Note was transferred to 
Deutsche Bank, as Trustee in 2006 and delivered," and the "Note 
remained in Deutsche Bank, as Trustee's possession until 2011." 
Feezer, however, did not indicate she had personal 
knowledge of possession, nor did she specify on what records she relied in determining Deutsche Bank received the Note on May 20, 
2006 and maintained possession until it was lost. See Deutsche
Bank Nat'l Tr. Co. as Tr. for Morgan Stanley ABS Cap. I Inc. Tr. 
2006-NC4 v. Yata, 152 Hawaiʻ i 322, 327 n.11, 336, 526 P.3d 299, 
304 n.11, 313 (2023) (concluding lender's "counsel's conclusory 
declaration" that she was in possession of the note was 
insufficient to establish possession). 
Moreover, Deutsche Bank produced no documentary 
evidence corroborating or supporting this written testimony. 
Thus, the record not only lacks foundation for Feezer's written 
testimony regarding possession, but even if foundation was laid, such conclusive and uncorroborated testimony may still be 
insufficient to establish possession. See U.S. Bank Tr., N.A.
as Tr. for LSF9 Master Participation Tr. v. Verhagen
, 149 Hawaiʻi 
315, 327-28, 489 P.3d 419, 431-32 (2021).

Thus, Deutsche Bank did not meet its burden of showing 
there was no genuine issue as to whether it was in physical 
possession of the Note when the Note was lost. 
(2) Bass next contends Deutsche Bank failed to 
establish it provided her with adequate notice of the default. 
To prevail on a foreclosure claim, a plaintiff must 
prove it gave cancellation notice in accordance with the terms 
of the mortgage. Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawaiʻ i at 367, 390 P.3d at 
1254. 
The Note was secured by a Mortgage, and Paragraph 15 
of the Mortgage provided in part: 
[a]ny notice to Borrower in connection with this Security 
Instrument shall be deemed to have been given to Borrower when mailed by first class mail or when actually delivered 
to Borrower's notice address if sent by other means. . . . 
The notice address shall be the Property Address unless 
Borrower has designated a substitute notice address by 
notice to Lender.  
In her declaration, Feezer stated, "[a]ccording to 
[the loan servicer]'s business records, Notice of the default 
was provided on April 16, 2018. A true and correct copy of the 
Notice kept and maintained in Servicer's business records is 
attached as Exhibit 6." Exhibit 6 showed that the notice of default was directed to Bass at an Idaho address, and the phrase 
"VIA First Class Mail" was typed on the first page. 
However, Feezer did not attach the Servicer's business 
records or otherwise establish the Servicer's regularly-

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
conducted business activities and record-keeping practices which 
might evidence that the Notice was in fact mailed via first 
class mail. In its reply in support of summary judgment, 
Deutsche Bank stated that the Notice was mailed to the address 
on file for Bass, but it pointed to no evidence in the record 
supporting this claim. 
Thus, we conclude that Deutsche Bank failed to meet 
its burden of showing there was no genuine issue as to whether 
it gave notice of default in accordance with the terms of the Mortgage. 
Based on the foregoing, we vacate the circuit court's 
August 3, 2020 "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order 
Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and 
Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure" and Judgment, and remand 
this case for further proceedings consistent with this summary 
disposition order.
