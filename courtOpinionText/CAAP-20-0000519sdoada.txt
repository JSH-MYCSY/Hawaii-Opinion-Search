On appeal, Cavalier contends that the Circuit Court 
erred in: (1) granting the Rices' May 13, 2019 motion for 
summary judgment (MSJ), where there were genuine issues of 
material fact; and (2) granting in part the Rices' August 30, 
2019 motion for attorneys' fees and costs (Fees Motion) and their 
May 14, 2020 supplemental motion for attorneys' fees and costs 
(Supplemental Fees Motion), where Cavalier's claim was not 
frivolous. 
After reviewing the record on appeal and the relevant 
legal authorities, and giving due consideration to the issues 
raised and the arguments advanced by the parties, we resolve Cavalier's contentions as follows. 
(1) Cavalier contends that the Circuit Court erred in 
granting the MSJ, where there were "multiple genuine issues of material fact regarding (1) the actions of [the Rices] in refusing or failing to sign the written Construction Agreement and the Hawaii Contractor's Right to Repair Act disclosures provided to them; (2) whether there was an implied contract and if such implied contract is sufficient for [Cavalier] to be entitled to the [subject l]ien; (3) whether the necessary disclosures were provided, and [the Rices] as consumers were given due notice of the terms and obligations of the agreement; [and] (4) whether [Cavalier] substantially complied with [Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 444-25.5
2/] by providing [the Rices] with 
2/ HRS § 444-25.5 (2013) states: 
Disclosure; contracts.  (a) Prior to entering into a
contract with a homeowner, or at the time a homeowner signs
a contract, involving home construction or improvements,licensed contractors shall: 
(1) Explain verbally in detail to the homeowner alllien rights of all parties performing under thecontract, including the homeowner, thecontractor, any subcontractor, or anymaterialman supplying commodities or labor onthe project; 
(2) Explain verbally in detail the homeowner'soption to demand bonding on the project, how thebond would protect the homeowner, and theapproximate expense of the bond; and 
(3) Disclose all information pertaining to thecontract and its performance and any other

the required disclosures and agreement . . . ." 
When a contractor fails to comply with the statutory 
requirements of HRS § 444–25.5, the contractor is barred from 
obtaining a mechanic's lien pursuant to HRS § 507-42./ See 808 
Development, LLC v. Murakami, 111 3
Hawai#i 349, 356, 359, 141 P.3d 
996, 1003, 1006 (2006) (holding that the statutory provisions of HRS § 444–25.5 are mandatory, and a contractor who fails to provide required disclosures to a homeowner before entering into a construction contract is not entitled to a mechanic's lien upon the property); Hiraga v. Baldonado, 96 Hawai# i 365, 373, 31 P.3d 
2/ (...continued) 
relevant information that the board may require
by rule. 
(b) All licensed contractors performing home
construction or improvements shall provide a writtencontract to the homeowner. The written contract shall: 
(1) Contain the information provided in subsection(a) and any other relevant information that theboard may require by rule; 
(2) Contain notice of the contractor's right toresolve alleged construction defects prior tocommencing any litigation in accordance withsection 672E-11; 
(3) Be signed by the contractor and the homeowner;and 
(4) Be executed prior to the performance of any homeconstruction or improvement. 
(c) For the purpose of this section, "homeowner"
means the owner or lessee of residential real property,including owners or lessees of condominium or cooperativeunits, notwithstanding owner-builder status. 
(d) Any violation of this section shall be deemed an
unfair or deceptive practice and shall be subject toprovisions of chapter 480, as well as the provisions of thischapter. 
3/ HRS § 507–42 (2018) provides, in pertinent part: 
When allowed; lessees, etc.  Any person or association
of persons furnishing labor or material in the improvementof real property shall have a lien upon the improvement aswell as upon the interest of the owner of the improvement inthe real property upon which the same is situated, or forthe benefit of which the same was constructed, for the priceagreed to be paid (if the price does not exceed the value ofthe labor and materials), or if the price exceeds the valuethereof or if no price is agreed upon by the contractingparties, for the fair and reasonable value of all labor andmaterials covered by their contract, express or implied.

222, 230 (App. 2001) (holding that "together, HRS §§ 480–124/ and 
507–42 preclude the imposition of a HRS § 507–42 lien upon the 
homeowner's property by any contractor who failed to comply with the requirements of HRS § 444–25.5" (footnote added)). 
Here, it is undisputed that the parties did not execute 
a written contract, as required by HRS § 444–25.5(b). Cavalier argues, based on a declaration and exhibits submitted below in opposition to the MSJ, that Cavalier delivered a written construction agreement and a disclosure of lien rights to the Rices, but they refused or failed to sign the written documents. Assuming this is true for purposes of the MSJ, there was still no genuine issue of material fact that the parties did not execute a written contract that met the requirements of HRS § 444–25.5(b). As a matter of law, Cavalier "ha[d] no basis for, and [was] not permitted to assert, a HRS § 507–42 lien upon [the Rices'] property." Hiraga
, 96 Hawai#i at 373, 31 P.3d at 230; 
see 808 
Development
, 111 Hawai#i at 357, 141 P.3d at 1004. 
Cavalier contends there are at least genuine issues as 
to whether it substantially complied with HRS § 444-25.5 by providing the Rices with the construction agreement and disclosures, and as to whether an implied contract existed between the parties. 
The asserted facts, however, are not 
material to whether Cavalier had a legal basis to assert a mechanic's lien against the Rices' property.
5/ The supreme court 
made clear in 808 Development
 that the statutory provisions of 
HRS § 444–25.5 are mandatory rather than directory, without exception. 111 
Hawai#i at 359, 141 P.3d at 1006; 
see id. at 361, 
141 P.3d at 1008 ("[W]e decline to create an exception to the clear statutory requirements of HRS § 444–25.5 and, instead, adhere to a bright-line standard that provides clear guidance to owners and contractors alike."). Where the contractor fails to comply with the requirements of HRS § 444–25.5, the parties' 
4/ HRS § 480–12 (2008) states: " Contracts void.  Any contract or
agreement in violation of this chapter is void and is not enforceable at law
or in equity." 
5/ In any event, delivery of the construction agreement and
disclosures, which Cavalier and the Rices did not sign, does not constitutesubstantial compliance with the requirements of HRS § 444-25.5(b). 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
contract is void under HRS § 444–25.5(d) and HRS §§ 480-2(a) and 
480-12. See id. at 356-57, 141 P.3d at 1003-04. The contractor 
cannot assert a contract-based mechanic's lien against the property and is left to pursue its claims in quantum meruit. See 
id. at 361, 141 P.3d at 1008; Hiraga, 96 Hawai# i at 372, 31 P.3d 
at 229. 
Accordingly, the Circuit Court did not err in granting 
the Rices' MSJ. 
(2) Cavalier contends that the Circuit Court abused its 
discretion in granting in part the Rices' Fees Motion and Supplemental Fees Motion, because Cavalier's claim was not frivolous pursuant to HRS § 607-14.5. 
Under HRS § 607-14.5 (2016), the circuit court may 
assess reasonable attorneys' fees and costs against a party in "[a] civil action . . . where a party seeks money damages or injunctive relief, or both, against another party . . . upon a specific finding that all or a portion of the party's claim or defense was frivolous . . . ." 
HRS § 607-14.5(a). A trial 
court's conclusion as to whether a claim was made in bad faith and thus frivolous under HRS § 607-14.5 presents mixed questions of fact and law, and is subject to review for clear error. See 
Coll v. McCarthy, 72 Haw. 20, 28, 804 P.2d 881, 886 (1991). We review a lower court's award of attorneys' fees for abuse of discretion. In re Trust Agreement Dated June 6, 1974
, 145 
Hawai#i 300, 309, 452 P.3d 297, 306 (2019). 
In the Fees Order, the Circuit Court awarded the Rices 
$
9,536.15 for attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to HRS § 607-
14.5, based on the following findings: 
In awarding these fees and costs, . . . the Court has
determined that (1) [Cavalier's Lien Application] wasfrivolous and not reasonably supported by the facts and thelaw as it did not meet the minimum statutory requirementsset forth in HRS § 444-25.5; and (2) in an April 26, 2019letter, prior to filing their successful [MSJ] as to[Cavalier's Lien Application, the Rices] advised [Cavalier]of its failure to meet these minimum statutory requirementsand requested that [Cavalier] dismiss the [Lien Application]with prejudice, which [Cavalier] refused to do. 
In the Supplemental Fees Order, the Circuit Court 
awarded the Rices $2,854.97 for attorneys' fees incurred in 
responding to Cavalier's January 31, 2020 motion for 
5   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
reconsideration of the Fees Order and in drafting the Rices' 
Supplemental Fees Motion. Although the Supplemental Fees Order does not state the statutory basis for awarding the requested additional fees, the Supplemental Fees Motion sought the award under HRS § 607-14.5. 
As a threshold matter, it appears that the Rices' 
attorneys' fees and costs were not recoverable under HRS § 607-14.5. 
The statute "applies only when a party seeks 'money 
damages or injunctive relief, or both.'" In re Hawaiian Flour Mills, Inc., 76 Hawai# i 1, 14, 868 P.2d 419, 432 (1994) (quoting 
HRS § 607-14.5); see Bd. of Land & Nat. Res. v. Crabtree, 154 Hawai 
#i 113, 116, 547 P.3d 446, 449 (2024) ("This original 
proceeding does not involve monetary damages. Thus, it must relate to injunctive relief for the Sierra Club to recover fees under HRS § 607-14.5."). Cavalier sought neither. Instead, it sought a lien against the Rices' property.
/  In these 
circumstances, HRS § 607-14.5 could not serve as the statutory basis for awarding the Rices their attorneys' fees and costs. 6
In any event, we conclude that the Circuit Court 
clearly erred in determining that the Lien Application was frivolous under HRS § 607-14.5(b). "Though HRS § 607-14.5 does not mention 'bad faith,' [the supreme] court has determined that the concept shapes a frivolous finding under that law. 
[The 
court] ha[s] said that an HRS § 607-14.5(b) 'finding of frivolousness is a high bar; it is not enough that a claim be without merit, there must be a showing of bad faith.'" See 
Crabtree, 154 Hawai# i at 119, 547 P.3d at 452 (quoting Tagupa v. 
VIPDesk, 135 Hawai# i 468, 479, 353 P.3d 1010, 1021 (2015)). It 
follows that "a meritless claim, without more, is not sufficient to show that the party acted in bad faith." Id. (brackets and 
ellipsis omitted) (quoting Pub. Access Trails Hawai# i v. 
Haleakala Ranch Co., 153 Hawai# i 1, 29, 526 P.3d 526, 554 
(2023)); see Coll, 72 Haw. at 29, 804 P.2d at 887 (a frivolous 
6/ A notice attached to the Lien Application included a "demand for
payment" upon the Rices, which was repeated in the Lien Application. But the 
Lien Application did not assert a claim for money damages based on anunderlying contract. See 808 Development
, 111 Hawai #i at 366, 141 P.3d at
1013 ("[T]he action was for the attachment of a mechanic's lien to the subjectproperty, not for damages based upon the underlying contract.").

claim is one so "manifestly and palpably without merit, so as to 
indicate bad faith on the pleader's part such that argument to the court was not required" (brackets omitted) (quoting Kawaihae v. Hawaiian Inc. Co., 1 Haw. App. 355, 619 P.2d 1086 (1980))). In the circumstances of this case, on this record, there was no showing that Cavalier acted in bad faith in filing the Lien Application, such that its "claim" was frivolous for purposes of HRS § 607-14.5. The Circuit Court thus abused its discretion in awarding the Rices their fees and costs pursuant to that statute. 
For the reasons discussed above, the July 29, 2020 
Final Judgment entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is reversed to the extent it awarded the Rices attorneys' fees and costs, and affirmed in all other respects.
