Banks sued Tsai and Valley Isle Surveyors, Inc. Banks 
alleged that Tsai owed money under a construction contract, and 
that Surveyors negligently staked building corners and points for construction of Tsai's home. Tsai filed a counterclaim against Banks and a cross-claim against Surveyors. The circuit court approved the parties' stipulation to stay proceedings pending arbitration of the claims between Banks and Tsai, and a Design Claim Conciliation Panel hearing on the claims against Surveyors. 
An Arbitration Award was issued on May 26, 2019. Banks 
filed a motion to confirm the award pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 658A-22. A self-represented Tsai mailed a 
letter to the circuit court stating that he didn't object to 
Banks's motion. The circuit court granted Banks's motion to confirm by order entered on October 16, 2019. Banks then moved for an award of attorney's fees and costs and prejudgment interest. Tsai did not oppose the motion. The circuit court granted the motion by order entered on June 12, 2020. 
Tsai, represented by counsel, filed a Hawai# i Rules of 
Civil Procedure (HRCP
) Rule 60 motion for relief from judgment on 
June 15, 2020. Banks opposed the motion. The Judgment was entered on July 22, 2020.
2 The Order Denying Relief from 
Judgment was entered on August 17, 2020. A Satisfaction of Judgment was filed on August 18, 2020. 
Tsai's notice of appeal was filed on August 24, 2020.

On June 7, 2023, we issued an order to show cause why this appeal should not be dismissed as moot. The mootness doctrine is properly invoked when "events subsequent to the judgment of the trial court have so affected the relations between the parties that the two conditions for justiciability relevant on appeal — 
2 The Judgment contained a finding of no just reason for delay and
directed entry of a judgment in favor of Banks and against Tsai, presumably
pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b). In substance, however, it was a judgment on thearbitration award entered pursuant to HRS § 658A-25. 
3 The thirtieth day after July 22, 2020, was Friday, August 21,
2020, a state holiday. See HRS § 8-1 (2009). The notice of appeal was timely
filed.

adverse interest and effective remedy — have been compromised." 
Lathrop v. Sakatani, 111 Hawai# i 307, 313, 141 P.3d 480, 486 
(2006) (citations omitted). 
Banks filed its response on June 21, 2023. Banks 
argued that the appeal was moot because the Judgment had been satisfied, and that no exceptions to the mootness doctrine applied. Tsai filed his response on August 23, 2023. Tsai agreed that his appeal should be dismissed as moot because the parties "have settled their dispute." 
For the foregoing reasons, this appeal is dismissed as 
moot.
