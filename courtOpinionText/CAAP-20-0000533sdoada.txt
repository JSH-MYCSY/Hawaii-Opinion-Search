GABRIEL ALISNA, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CRIMINAL NO. 1PC131001861) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Gabriel Alisna
 appeals from the 
"Judgment
 of Conviction and Sentence" entered by the Circuit 
Court of the First Circuit on July 30, 2020.1  For the reasons 
explained below, we affirm the Judgment. 
On December 18, 2013, Alisna was indicted by the O# ahu 
grand jury on five counts of Violation of Privacy in the First 
Degree in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS
) § 711-
1110.9.   The indictment charged, in relevant part: 2
COUNT 1:  On or about January 1, 2013, to and
including February 16, 2013, in the City and County of
Honolulu, State of Hawaii, GABRIEL ALISNA, did intentionallyor knowingly install or use, or both, in any private place, 
1 The Honorable Karen T. Nakasone entered the Judgment but the
Honorable Rom A. Trader presided over Alisna's trial. 
2 Alisna was also indicted on two counts of Sexual Assault in the 
Fourth Degree in violation of HRS § 707-733(l)(a).  Those counts were severed for a separate trial, and were ultimately dismissed without prejudice onMay 12, 2020. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
without consent of the person or persons to wit,
[complaining witness], entitled to privacy therein, anydevice for observing, recording, amplifying, and/orbroadcasting another person in a stage of undress or sexualactivity in that place, thereby committing the offense ofViolation of Privacy in the First Degree, in violation ofSection 711-1110.9 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes. 
Counts 2-5 were substantially identical to Count 1, except for 
the names of the complaining witnesses and the dates of the alleged offenses. 
When Alisna was indicted HRS § 711-1110.9 (Supp. 2012) 
provided, in relevant part: 
§ 711-1110.9  Violation of privacy in the first 
degree .  (1) A person commits the offense of violation of
privacy in the first degree if, except in the execution of a
public duty or as authorized by law , the person
intentionally or knowingly installs or uses, or both, in any
private place, without consent of the person or personsentitled to privacy therein, any device for observing,recording, amplifying, or broadcasting another person in astage of undress or sexual activity in that place. 
(Emphasis added.)3 
Alisna worked as a teacher for Kamehameha Schools.  He 
lived in faculty housing on the Kapâlama Campus.  Alisna filed a 
pretrial motion to suppress evidence.  He argued that Kamehameha Schools employees entered his residence without his permission, removed his property (a mini-spy camera with a memory card), and provided it to the Honolulu Police Department (
HPD) as evidence 
in his criminal case.  The trial court denied the motion to suppress. 
Jury-waived trial began on October 1, 2018.  The State 
introduced evidence that Alisna video recorded three minors, without their permission, while the minors were showering nude in Alisna's residence.  The State rested. 
Alisna rested without calling any witnesses.  He then 
filed a motion to dismiss.  He argued that Counts 1-5 failed to allege all elements of the offense because there was no 
3 The State's answering brief quotes the current version of the
statute rather than the version in effect at the time of the alleged offense. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
allegation that he was not acting "in the execution of a public 
duty or as authorized by law[.]" 
Alisna also made an oral motion for a judgment of 
acquittal.  He argued that the State failed to prove that he was not acting "in the execution of a public duty or as authorized by law[.]" 
The trial court denied both of Alisna's motions by 
order entered on November 6, 2018.  The trial court ruled: 
the exception that's embodied in 711-1110.9 constitutes a
defense and not an element of the offense and, therefore,that is pivotal to the Court's ruling on both of thesemotions, because if it is an element, it's required to bealleged, it's required to be proven or disproved. 
If it's a defense, then it's not required to be
alleged, and it's not required for the State to produceevidence of that in its case in chief. 
The Judgment was entered on July 30, 2020.  Alisna was 
found guilty as charged on Counts 1-5.  He was sentenced to five 
years in prison on each count, to run concurrently.  This appeal followed. 
Alisna contends: (1) the trial court erroneously denied 
his motion to suppress evidence; (2) the trial court erroneously 
denied his motion to dismiss counts 1-5 of the indictment; and 
(3) the trial court erroneously denied his motion for judgment of 
acquittal. 
1. The trial court did not err by denying
the motion to suppress evidence. 
Alisna argues that his mini-spy camera and memory card 
should have been suppressed as evidence because Kamehameha 
Schools employees entered his on-campus apartment and removed those items without his permission, in violation of his right to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 7 of the Hawai# i Constitution. 
[T]he proponent of a motion to suppress has the burden of
establishing not only that the evidence sought to be 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
excluded was unlawfully secured, but also, that [their] own
Fourth Amendment rights were violated by the search andseizure sought to be challenged.  The proponent of themotion to suppress must satisfy this burden of proof by apreponderance of the evidence. 
State v. Lawson, 103 Hawai# i 11, 19, 78 P.3d 1159, 1167 (App. 
2003) (quoting State v. Anderson, 84 Hawai# i 462, 467, 935 P.2d 
1007, 1012 (1997)). 
The purpose of the constitutional right to be secure 
against unreasonable searches and seizures is "to protect 
individuals against intrusions by the government."  Lawson, 103 Hawai# i at 19, 78 P.3d at 1167 (quoting State v. Kahoonei, 83 
Hawai# i 124, 129, 925 P.2d 294, 299 (1996)).  Evidence obtained 
by a private individual acting wholly on their own initiative is properly admissible in a criminal trial.  Id. There is no 
bright-line rule to determine whether a private individual is acting on their own or as a government agent; "the correct test for determining whether a private individual is a government agent is the 'totality of the circumstances test.'"  Kahoonei, 83 Hawai# i at 130, 925 P.2d at 300. 
The [Hawai #i Supreme Court] stated that under the totality
of the circumstances test, several factors may be considered
in determining whether a private individual was acting as apolice agent: 
whether the private individual: (1) was activelyrecruited [by the government]; (2) was directed by agovernment agent; (3) acted for a private purpose; and(4) received any payment for [their] services. 
Lawson, 103 Hawai# i at 19-20, 78 P.3d at 1167-68 (first quoting 
Kahoonei, 83 Hawai# i at 127, 925 P.2d at 297; and then citing 
State v. Boynton, 58 Haw. 530, 537–38, 574 P.2d 1330, 1335 
(1978)). 
Alisna's motion to suppress was heard on May 17, 18, 
and June 19, 2018.  The trial court entered findings of fact, conclusions of law, and its order denying the motion to suppress on July 27, 2018.  Alisna challenges findings of fact nos. 21, 22, and 23, and conclusions of law nos. 16, 17, 18, and 19. 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
We review findings of fact under the "clearly 
erroneous" standard.  Lawson, 103 Hawai# i at 19, 78 P.3d at 1167. 
A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when (1) the record lacks 
substantial evidence to support the finding, or (2) despite substantial evidence in support of the finding, the appellate court is nonetheless left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.  Id. 
The trial court found: 
21. The Court finds that entry into [Alisna]'s residence
on March 7, 2014 was consistent and supported byprovisions of the lease agreement entered into by andbetween [Alisna] and KS [Kamehameha Schools]. 
Alisna's on-campus housing agreement was in evidence as defense 
exhibit E.  Under this agreement, Alisna was prohibited from using his apartment "for any unlawful or immoral purpose whatsoever[.]"  If Kamehameha Schools discovered that illegal or immoral acts were taking place in Alisna's apartment, Kamehameha Schools had the right to terminate Alisna's tenancy and to "take any other reasonable action [as] necessary to stop the illegal or immoral activity."  The agreement allowed Kamehameha Schools to enter Alisna's apartment to conduct inspections.  Finding of fact no. 21 was supported by substantial evidence and was not clearly erroneous. 
The trial court also found: 
22. The Court further finds that the testimony received at
the hearing on the Motion to Suppress from KS securityofficers, Clark Mills and Michael Moses, as well asfrom HPD officers John Omerod and Detective Brian Tokita, are credible. 
Evaluating witness credibility is within the province of the 
trial court, and will not be second-guessed on appeal.  State v. Jenkins, 93 Hawai# i 87, 103-04, 997 P.2d 13, 29-30 (2000). 
Finally, the trial court found: 
23. That KS security officers who searched and seized
evidence from [Alisna]'s residence were acting asprivate actors employed by a private school entity. 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Alisna is bound by the following findings of fact, which he does 
not contest, State v. Rodrigues, 145 Hawai# i 487, 494, 454 P.3d 
428, 435 (2019): 
4. On or about March 2, 2013, KS received an anonymous
report that [Alisna] secretly video recorded KSstudents in the nude, while they showered at[Alisna]'s residence.  
5. Upon receiving the above-mentioned report, KSinitiated an attorney-driven investigation of [Alisna]independent of any police investigation.  KS did not inform HPD or any other institution of the allegationagainst [Alisna] or its independent investigation of[Alisna]. 
. . . . 
8. On March 7, 2013, while [Alisna] attended the facultymeeting, and at the direction of KS compliance officerDavid Burge, KS security officers Clark Mills andMichael Moses, [sic] entered [Alisna]'s residencewithout notice to, or permission from, [Alisna] andwithout a warrant; searched [Alisna]'s residence,including [Alisna]'s shower; discovered, among otherthings, a bracket located in the shower of [Alisna]'sresidence, a mini-spy camera equipped with a SecureDigital ("SD") memory card that fit into the showerbracket, and various power cords; and physicallyremoved the mini-spy camera with SD memory card andaccompanying power cords, among other things, from[Alisna]'s residence. 
9. KS security officers took the items seized from[Alisna]'s residence to the KS security office,located on the Kapalama [sic] campus. 
. . . . 
12. The KS security officers who entered [Alisna]'sresidence were not employed or otherwise contracted byHPD or any other governmental agency. 
. . . . 
14. KS security officers Mills and Moses did not receiveany compensation from HPD or any other law enforcementagency for the search of [Alisna]'s residence. 
These uncontested facts support finding of fact no. 23, which was 
not clearly erroneous. 
Alisna also challenges conclusions of law nos. 16, 17, 
18 and 19.  The trial court's conclusions of law are reviewed under the right/wrong standard.  Lawson, 103 Hawai# i at 19, 78 
P.3d at 1167.  A conclusion of law that is supported by the trial 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
court's findings of fact and reflects an application of the 
correct rule of law will not be overturned.  Est. of Klink ex rel. Klink v. State, 113 Hawai# i 332, 351, 152 P.3d 504, 523 
(2007). 
The trial court concluded: 
16. . . . For the following reasons, the court concludes
that the March 7, 2013 search and seizure was aprivate search, not subject to the constitutionalrestraints set forth in the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 7 ofthe Hawaii [sic] State Constitution, and theexclusionary rule does not preclude the State fromusing evidence recovered as a result of the March 7,2013 search and seizure: 
a. It is undisputed that KS security officers
are not employed, or otherwise contractedby HPD or any other governmental agency. 
b. It is undisputed that KS is a private
educational institution and employs itsown security personnel. 
c. KS has a responsibility to act with the
best interest of the minor students who attend its school. 
d. KS security officers are not law
enforcement officers.  They do not havethe authority to effectuate an arrest, norare they charged with the responsibilityof enforcing the laws of the State ofHawaii [sic]. 
e. KS did not report the anonymous tip to
police authorities at the time it wasreceived, which indicates that KS was notmotivated by law enforcement purposes. 
f. The security personnel involved in the
search were not "actively" or inactively"recruited" by the police or any othergovernmental agency.  On the contrary, KSsecurity officers were acting as privateindividuals presumably, at the behest oftheir employer, KS.  Furthermore, thesecurity officers were not paid by thegovernment to conduct the search and the[sic] received no enumeration [sic] forthis search by police. 
g. KS security was not "specificallydirected" by HPD.  In fact, HPD was notaware of the search being conducted by KS,nor was it aware of the anonymouscomplaint made to KS officials that[Alisna] had secretly been recordingstudents in the shower of [Alisna]'s 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
residence.  Furthermore, HPD was not
present when the search was executed onMarch 7, 2013, nor did KS request HPD'spresence during the search.  KS did not contact HPD until March 8, 2013, one dayafter the search had already beencompleted and evidence seized by KS.  No evidence, save for Moses's writtenstatement, was turned over to OfficerOmerod during his initial investigation of[Alisna] on March 8, 2013. 
h. Prior to the March 7, 2013 search andseizure, [Alisna] entered into a leaseagreement with KS and was residing infaculty on-campus housing provided to himby KS.  Under the terms of [the] leaseagreement, KS security was authorized to:(1) enter [Alisna]'s residence, (2)immediately terminate the lease agreement,and (3) take any reasonable action to stopany illegal or immoral activity.  KS security officers entered [Alisna]'sresidence in a manner consistent with the lease agreement. 
i. That the motivation of KS securityofficers to enter into [Alisna]'sresidence, whether proper or not, underthe lease agreement entered into by andbetween KS and [Alisna], is irrelevantgiven that the security officers were notacting as law enforcement or agents of lawenforcement. 
The factual premises for conclusion of law no. 16 are supported 
by substantial evidence in the record.  Conclusion of law no. 16 reflects the proper application of the Kahoonei "totality of the circumstances test." 
The trial court also concluded: 
17. . . . [Alisna] relies on State v. Bowe, 77 Haw. Hawaii 
[sic] 51 (1994), which stands for the proposition that
the State cannot use a statement that is deemed involuntary when provided under the undue influence ofa private person.  For the following reasons, thecourt concludes that the March 7, 2013 search andseizure did not rise to the level of a constitutionally invalid infringement of [Alisna]'s
right to privacy under Article I, Section 7 of the 
Hawaii [sic] State Constitution: 
a. Bowe is distinguishable from the present case in
several, important ways.  First, Bowe involved astatement that later deemed by the appellatecourt to be "involuntary" and thus suppressedunder Article I, Section 10 of the Hawaii [sic]State Constitution and State v. Kelekolio, 74 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Haw. 479 (1993).  Unlike Bowe, [Alisna] is not
seeking suppression of any statement he may haveprovided.  Second, in Bowe, the police contactedthe basketball head coach to make arrangementsto have certain members of the team, to includeBowe, appear at the police station for purposesof providing a statement.  Here, unlike in Bowe,the police were contacted after the March 7,2013 search and seizure.  Third, unlike in Bowe,there is no evidence of [Alisna] being coercedto allow KS into his residence for purposes of asearch.  Accordingly, Bowe is not applicable. 
(Handwriting in italics.)  The trial court correctly 
distinguished Bowe; conclusion no. 17 was not wrong. 
The trial court also concluded: 
18. During the June 19, 2018 motion hearing, the Court
observed: 
Although there was some interaction between KSand law enforcement at some point, there wasnothing that rose to the level such that they,meaning KS security staff, could be viewed bythis Court as agents of law enforcement.  There was no prior discussion before they began theirinvestigation, there was no sharing ofinformation, there was no request for direction,instruction, there was absolutelynothing--certainly there was no payment orreward or anything like that which some of thecases speak about. 
The factual premises for conclusion of law no. 18 are supported 
by substantial evidence in the record; conclusion of law no. 18 reflects the proper application of the Kahoonei "totality of the circumstances test."  Conclusion of law no. 18 was not wrong. 
Finally, the trial court concluded: 
19. In light of the above, and based upon applicable
statutory and legal authority, the court properlydenies [Alisna]'s December 12, 2016 Motion to SuppressEvidence on both the constitutional and statutoryclaims raised by [Alisna]. 
Conclusion of law no. 19 is supported by the trial court's 
findings of fact and reflects an application of the correct rule of law.  It was not wrong. 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2. The trial court did not abuse its 
discretion by denying the motion todismiss. 
"A trial court's ruling on a motion to dismiss an 
indictment is reviewed for an abuse of discretion."  State v. 
Deguair, 136 Hawai# i 71, 84, 358 P.3d 43, 56 (2015) (citation 
omitted).  "The trial court abuses its discretion when it clearly exceeds the bounds of reason or disregards rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant."  Id. (citation omitted).  "The burden of establishing abuse of discretion is on appellant, and a strong showing is required to establish it."  Id. at 84–85, 358 P.3d at 56–57. 
Alisna contends that counts 1-5 of the indictment 
should have been dismissed because the State failed to allege that Alisna was not acting "in the execution of a public duty or as authorized by law[.]"  However, HRS § 806-29 (1993) provides: 
§ 806-29  Exceptions need not be negatived .  No 
indictment for any offense created or defined by statute
shall be deemed objectionable for the reason that it failsto negative any exception, excuse, or proviso contained inthe statute creating or defining the offense.  The fact that the charge is made shall be considered as an allegation thatno legal excuse for the doing of the act existed in aparticular case. 
HRS § 806-29 "specifically provides that an indictment 
is not required to negate exceptions set forth in the statute 
establishing the offense."  State v. Turping, 136 Hawai# i 333, 
335, 361 P.3d 1236, 1238 (App. 2015) (citing HRS § 806-29 (2014))
4.  Thus, the State was not required to allege that Alisna 
was not acting "in the execution of a public duty or as authorized by law" in counts 1-5 of the indictment.  Contrary to Alisna's contentions, findings of fact nos. 9 and 11 in the November 6, 2018 order were supported by substantial evidence and were not clearly erroneous; conclusions of law nos. 3, 9, and 11-18 were supported by the trial court's findings of fact and 
4 The 2014 version and 1993 version of HRS § 806-29 are identical
because the statute has not been amended since 1972. 
10 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
reflect an application of the correct rules of law.  The trial 
court did not abuse its discretion by denying Alisna's motion to dismiss. 
3. The trial court did not err by denying
the motion for judgment of acquittal. 
We review the trial court's ruling on a motion for 
judgment of acquittal de novo using the same standard as the 
trial court.  See State v. Carroll, 146 Hawai# i 138, 150, 456 P.3d 
502, 514 (2020).  The standard applied by a trial court in ruling upon a motion for a judgment of acquittal is whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a trier of fact could fairly conclude that the defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  Id. 
Alisna's motion for judgment of acquittal argued that 
the State failed to prove he was not acting "in the execution of a public duty or as authorized by law[.]" In response, the State argued that the exception was "not a material element for [sic] which the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt."  The trial court agreed with the State: 
[T]he Court's going to rule that the exception that's
embodied in 711-1110.9 constitutes a defense and not an element of the offense and, therefore, that is pivotal tothe Court's ruling on both of these motions, because if itis an element, it's required to be alleged, it's required tobe proven or disproved. 
If it's a defense, then it's not required . . . for
the State to produce evidence of that in its case in chief. 
. . . . 
And notwithstanding the fact that there's complete
lack of evidence with regard to disproving the exception,that [sic] that's not fatal in this particular case to theState.  
The Hawai# i Supreme Court's recent decision in State v. 
Castillon, 144 Hawai# i 406, 443 P.3d 98 (2019) is dispositive.  In 
that case Castillon was convicted of driving without a license 
(
DWOL).  The DWOL statute at issue, HRS § 286-102(a) (2007), 
provided that "No person, except one exempted under section 286-
11 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
105 . . . shall operate any category of motor vehicles listed in 
this section without first being appropriately examined and duly 
licensed as a qualified driver of that category of motor vehicles."  (Emphasis added.)  HRS § 286-105 (2007) provided that persons possessing a valid driver's license issued by Canada, or a valid commercial driver's license issued by Canada or Mexico, were "exempt from license[.]" 
Castillon contended that the State had the burden to 
prove she did not have a valid driver's license issued by Canada, or a valid commercial driver's license issued by Canada or Mexico, and failed to present any evidence on that essential element of DWOL.  The supreme court disagreed.  Citing HRS § 701-115(a), the supreme court stated that "a fact or set of facts which negatives penal liability" is a defense.  Id. at 411, 443 P.3d at 103.  The supreme court then held: 
Here, if Castillon had introduced "some evidence"[5] that she
possessed a valid driver's license in Canada or a valid
commercial driver's license in Canada or Mexico, the burdenwould shift to the State to introduce evidence disprovingher defense. 
Therefore, we concur with the ICA's conclusion that
the exemptions referenced in HRS § 286-102(a) and describedin HRS § 286-105 are defenses to the offense of DWOL, forwhich Castillon bore the initial burden of production.  We make this determination irrespective of whether Castillonhad knowledge or private control over facts establishingthat she had a valid driver's license in Canada or Mexico. Because she did not produce "some evidence" that shepossessed a valid driver's license that would qualify herfor exemption, as set forth in HRS § 286-105, the burden didnot shift to the State. 
Id. at 412, 443 P.3d at 104. 
Similarly, in this case evidence that Alisna acted "in 
the execution of a public duty or as authorized by law" when he 
secretly recorded students showering in the nude would negative penal liability under HRS § 701-1110.9.  Under HRS § 701-115(a), 
5 "'Some evidence' is 'such evidence [that] would support the
consideration of that issue by the jury, no matter how weak, inconclusive, or
unsatisfactory the evidence may be.'"  Castillon, 144 Hawai #i at 411 n.9, 443 
P.3d at 103 n.9 (quoting State v. Maelega, 80 Hawai #i 172, 178–79, 907 P.2d 
758, 764–65 (1995)) (other citations omitted). 
12 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that set of facts would be a defense, for which Alisna bore the 
burden of production.  Alisna introduced no evidence that he acted in the execution of a public duty or as authorized by law. Thus, the burden never shifted to the State to introduce evidence disproving the defense.  Castillon, 144 Hawai# i at 411-12, 443 
P.3d at 103-04; cf. State v. Romano, 114 Hawai# i 1, 6, 155 P.3d 
1102, 1107 (2007) (holding statutory exception was a defense); State v. Jenkins, 93 Hawai# i 87, 107, 997 P.2d 13, 33 (2000) 
(same); State v. Lee, 90 Hawai# i 130, 138, 976 P.2d 444, 452 
(1999) (same); State v. Bowman, 135 Hawai# i 180, 187, 346 P.3d 
249, 256 (App. 2015) (same), rev'd on other grounds, 137 Hawai# i 
398, 375 P.3d 177 (2016); Turping, 136 Hawai# i at 336-37, 361 P.3d 
at 1239-40 (same); State v. Nobriga, 10 Haw. App. 353, 359, 873 P.2d 110, 113 (1994) (same), overruled on other grounds by State v. Maelega, 80 Hawai# i 172, 907 P.2d 758 (1995).  Findings of fact 
nos. 9 and 11 in the November 6, 2018 order were supported by substantial evidence and were not clearly erroneous; conclusions of law nos. 3, 9, and 11-18 were supported by the trial court's findings of fact and reflect an application of the correct rules of law. 
For the foregoing reasons, the "Judgment of Conviction 
and Sentence" entered by the circuit court on July 30, 2020, is affirmed.
