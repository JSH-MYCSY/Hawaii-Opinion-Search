APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
ORDER APPROVING IN PART STIPULATION

Upon consideration of the Stipulation for Dismissal of

the appeals in this consolidated appeal without prejudice and
bear their own costs on appeal; (3) the Stipulation is dated and
signed by counsel for all parties appearing in the appeals; and
(4) dismissal is authorized by Hawai#i Rules of Appellate
Procedure Rule 42(b).  
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Stipulation is
approved in part and the appeal is dismissed.  The parties shall
bear their own costs.
