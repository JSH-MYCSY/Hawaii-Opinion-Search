APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1CCV-19-0002152) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and McCullen, JJ.) 
Na Kia#i O Ma#ili, Inc., James Brito
, Sr., and Ted 
Kuahine appeal from the Final Judgment  for Laulima  Development 
LLC and the City and County of Honolulu entered by the Circuit 
Court of the First Circuit on August 10, 2020.1 We affirm. 
Laulima was developing Hale Makana O Maili, a rental 
housing project intended to provide long-term affordable housing 
to Wai#anae Coast communities. 
During February and March 2017, 
Laulima presented the project at public meetings of the Wai #anae 
Coast Neighborhood Board, the  Nānākuli-M ā#ili Neighborhood 
Board's Planning and Zoning Committee, and the N ānākuli-M ā#ili 
Neighborhood Board. A link to the draft environmental assessment was published on the state Department of Health Office of Environmental Quality Control website on February 23, 2017. That

satisfied the Hawai#i Environmental Policy Act, Hawaii Revised 
Statutes ( HRS) Chapter 343 ( HEPA). On June 8, 2017 (after the 
public review period for the draft environmental assessment 
ended), a link to the project's Final Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact was published on the Office of Environmental Quality Control website. 
Laulima requested affordable housing exemptions from 
certain City regulations and fees under HRS § 201H-38. 
The 
City's Department of Planning and Permitting ( DPP) sent its staff 
report and recommendation for approval to the City Council on September 21, 2018. The City Council's Committee on Zoning and Housing held a public meeting on Laulima's request on October 18, 2018. The committee recommended approval. The City Council held a public meeting and approved the request on October 30, 2018. 
Na Kia#i
 sued Laulima and the City on November 14, 
2019. 
Laulima and the City moved to dismiss under Hawai #i Rules 
of Civil Procedure ( HRCP) Rule 12(b)(6). Brito and Kuahine moved 
to intervene. Na Kia#i moved to amend its complaint. The 
circuit court granted both motions to dismiss and denied the motion to amend and the motion to intervene. The Final Judgment was entered on August 10, 2020. This appeal followed. 
The opening brief contains three overlapping points of 
error. 
All challenge the dismissal of the complaint.2 The 
motions to dismiss and the oppositions presented matters outside the pleadings that weren't excluded by the circuit court. We apply the standard of review for HRCP Rule 56 motions for summary judgment. HRCP Rule 12(b); Okutsu v. State
, 153 Hawai#i 192, 
195, 528 P.3d 956, 959 (App. 2023). We review a grant of summary judgment de novo. 
Nozawa v. Operating Engineers Local Union 
No. 3
, 142 Hawai#i 331, 338, 418 P.3d 1187, 1194 (2018). The 
issues of constitutional law raised by Na Kia #i are also reviewed 
2 The statement of the points of error does not challenge the orders
denying the motion to amend or motion to intervene. Those orders are not 
before us in this appeal. Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(4).

de novo. Davis v. Bissen , 154 Hawai #i 68, 77, 545 P.3d 557, 566 
(2024). 
Na Kia#i argues it was deprived of property without due 
process of law in violation of Hawai #i Constitution article I, 
section 53 and article XI, section 9.4 The circuit court 
concluded that Na Kia #i did not show it had a protected property 
interest that triggered due process protection, citing In re 
Application of Maui Electric Company, Ltd. , 141 Hawai #i 249, 260, 
408 P.3d 1, 12 (2017) (stating that "in order for procedural due process protections to apply, Sierra Club must possess an interest which qualifies as 'property' within the meaning of the constitution.") (cleaned up)). We need not decide whether Na Kia#i had a constitutionally protected property interest, because 
under de novo review we "may affirm a judgment of the lower court on any ground in the record that supports affirmance." State v. 
Fukagawa , 100 
Hawai#i 498, 506-07, 60 P.3d 899, 907-08 (2002). 
Even if Na Kia #i had a constitutionally protected property 
interest, the record does not show that Na Kia #i was deprived of 
due process. 
"Procedural due process requires notice and an 
opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner before governmental deprivation of [a] property interest." Ito v. Invs. Equity Life Holding Co. , 135 Hawai #i 49, 73, 346 
3 Haw. Const. art. I, § 5 provides: 
No person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property
without due process of law, nor be denied the equalprotection of the laws, nor be denied the enjoyment of theperson's civil rights or be discriminated against in theexercise thereof because of race, religion, sex or ancestry. 
4 Haw. Const. art. XI, § 9 provides: 
Each person has the right to a clean and healthful
environment, as defined by laws relating to environmentalquality, including control of pollution and conservation,protection and enhancement of natural resources. Any personmay enforce this right against any party, public or private,through appropriate legal proceedings, subject to reasonablelimitations and regulation as provided by law.

P.3d 118, 142 (2015) (cleaned up). As best we can discern, Na 
Kia#i contends it was deprived of due process because none of its 
members received notice of the project. 
According to the 
complaint, this was because of Laulima "misleading in the naming of the development project submitted to the City & County of Honolulu with a place name that does not exist in Hawai #i 
according to Place Names of Hawai #i[.]" Na Kia#i doesn't cite to 
the record where Laulima's submission to the City can be found. We are not obligated to search the record for information that should have been provided by Na Kia #i. Haw. Ventures, LLC v. 
Otaka, Inc. , 114 Hawai #i 438, 480, 164 P.3d 696, 738 (2007). We 
note that DPP's report to the City Council on Laulima's HRS § 201H-38 application refers to the project as Hale Makana O 
Maili
. Not Mā#ili. It appears that Na Kia #i is arguing its 
members didn't realize the project was located in M ā#ili because 
of the way its name was spelled. But DPP's report contains the tax map key number for the property involved, the names of streets and a stream bordering the property, and maps of the location. Under these circumstances, we decline to hold that the difference between Maili and Mā
#ili resulted in a denial of due 
process.5 
The opening brief argues that "the very ordinance which 
authorized the housing development was misleading by failing to name the correct name of the street along which the Plaintiff members lived, calling it Kuaaupuni Street as opposed to the proper name, Kulaaupuni street[.]" The brief does not cite the ordinance. City Council Resolution No. 18-206, CD1, FD1 (Oct. 30, 2018) authorizing the HRS § 201H-38 exemptions refers to Kulaaupuni  Street once, and to Kuaaupuni  Street once, both in 
reference to the project's location. The draft environmental assessment contains multiple references to Kulaaupuni  Street and 
does not use the name Kuaaupuni . Under these circumstances, we 
5 We also note that Na Kia#i spells its name Ma#ili rather than 
Mā#ili. See Mary Kawena Pukui, Samuel H. Elbert & Esther T. Mookini, Place
Names of Hawaii  139 (2nd ed. paperback 1976).

also decline to conclude that the single typographical error in 
the City Council resolution is of constitutional consequence. 
Na Kiai# summarized its lack-of-notice arguments during 
the circuit court hearing as: "There was no mail sent to us. There was no signs put up in our area. No one called us, no one contacted us, and instead they just proceeded with this whole ball of wax[.]" The record shows, and Na Kia #i does not 
controvert, that Laulima presented the project during public meetings of the Wai #anae Coast Neighborhood Board, the 
Nānākuli-M ā#ili Neighborhood Board's Planning and Zoning 
Committee, and the N ānākuli-M ā#ili Neighborhood Board. The 
record shows, and Na Kia #i does not controvert, that Laulima 
complied with HEPA's notice requirements. Na Kia#i cites no 
statute, administrative rule, or other law requiring notice by mail or posting under the circumstances of this case. See, e.g., 
HRS § 281-57 (Supp. 2019) (liquor license applicant must mail notice of hearing on application to owners of property within five hundred feet from applicant's premises). 
The circuit court did not err by granting Laulima's and 
the City's motions to dismiss. The "Final Judgment in Favor of Defendants Laulima Development LLC and City and County of Honolulu" entered by the circuit court on August 10, 2020, is affirmed.
