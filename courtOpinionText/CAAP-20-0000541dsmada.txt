November 3, 2020 "Motion to Dismiss Appellant Deanna
Kahookaulana's [(Kahookaulana )] Notice of Appeal Filed
September 1, 2020" ( Motion to Dismiss), and the record, it
appears we lack appellate jurisdiction over Kahookaulana's appea l
from Civil No. 3CC161000180, in the Circuit Court of the Third
Circuit.
The appeal is untimely because Kahookaulana did not
file her September 1, 2020 notice of appeal within thirty days
after entry of the May 11, 2020 Judgment or issuance of the
May 11, 2020 Writ of Ejectment, as required by Hawai# i Rules of
Appellate Procedure ( HRAP) Rule 4(a)(1).  There is no indication
in the record on appeal that the time to file the notice of
appeal was extended.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 "As a general rule, compliance with the requirement of
the timely filing of a notice of appeal is jurisdictional, . . .
and we must dismiss an appeal on our motion if we lack
jurisdiction."  Grattafiori v. State, 79 Hawai#i 10, 13, 897 P.2d

justice is authorized to change the jurisdictional requirements
contained in Rule 4 of these rules.").
