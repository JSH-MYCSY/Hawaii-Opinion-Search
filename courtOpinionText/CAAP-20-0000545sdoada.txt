OF THE STATE OF HAWAI I #
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
ROMAN SEMES, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 2PC151001014(3)) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Roman Semes (
Semes) appeals from 
the August 4, 2020 Order Denying Defendant's Motion to Dismiss 
Count Five of the Indictment for Failure to State an Offense (Order Denying Second Motion to Dismiss), entered in the Circuit 
Court of the Second Circuit (Circuit Court).
1 
Semes raises a single point of error on appeal, 
contending that the Circuit Court erred when it entered the Order 
Denying Second Motion to Dismiss. 
1 The Honorable Kelsey K. Kawano entered the Order Denying Motion. 
The Honorable Joseph E. Cardoza presided over the underlying criminal
proceeding and entered the Judgment.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve Semes's point of error as follows: 
On April 2, 2018, the Circuit Court entered a Judgment; 
Conviction and Sentence; Notice of Entry (Judgment) in the 
underlying criminal proceeding.  Pursuant to a plea agreement and 
guilty plea, Semes was convicted on two counts of Negligent Homicide in the First Degree, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707-702.5 (2014), two counts of Negligent Injury 
in the First Degree, in violation of HRS § 707-705 (2014), and 
one count of Accidents Involving Death or Serious Bodily Injury, in violation of HRS § 291C-12 (2020) (Count 5),
2 and sentenced to 
consecutive terms of imprisonment, collectively totaling 40 years, including 10 years for Count 5.  Prior to the entry of the Judgment, on March 22, 2018, Semes filed a motion to dismiss Count 5 for failure to state an offense (First Motion to 
Dismiss), which was orally denied at the sentencing hearing held on April 2, 2018, with a written order entered on August 14, 
2018. 
2 HRS § 291C-12 provides, in relevant part: 
§ 291C-12  Accidents involving death or serious bodily 
injury.   (a)  The driver of any vehicle involved in an
accident resulting in bodily injury to or death of anyperson shall immediately stop the vehicle at the sceneof the accident or as close thereto as possible butshall then forthwith return to and in every eventshall remain at the scene of the accident until the driver has fulfilled the requirements of section291C-14.  Every such stop shall be made withoutobstructing traffic more than is necessary. 
2  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On November 18, 2018, Semes filed a direct appeal from 
the Judgment (CAAP-18-0000898), challenging the Circuit Court's 
denial of his demand for a jury trial on the issue of consecutive sentences on due process grounds, but not arguing that (1) the Circuit Court abused its discretion in imposing consecutive sentences, or (2) the Circuit Court erred in denying the First Motion to Dismiss.  This court affirmed the Judgment, and Semes's petition for writ of certiorari was ultimately dismissed. 
Subsequent to the filing of Semes's direct appeal in 
CAAP-18-0000898, on March 13, 2020, the supreme court issued State v. Baker, 146 
Hawai# i 299, 463 P.3d 956 (2020), where it 
assessed whether a charge must include that "every such stop be made without obstructing traffic more than is necessary" when charging a driver with the offense of not stopping at an accident scene and providing the required information under HRS § 291C-13 (2020).
3  Id. at 302, 463 P.3d at 959.  The supreme court held 
that, "[t]he requirement that the stop was made without obstructing traffic more than is necessary is thus a requisite aspect of proof of the offense when the driver stops at, or forthwith returns to, a location that the State contends is not as close as 'possible' to the accident scene."  Id. at 307, 463 P.3d at 964. 
3 As the State acknowledges, although HRS § 291C-13 involves the
offense of Accidents Involving Damage to Vehicle or Property, the identical
subject phrase is contained in HRS § 291C-12. 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Thereafter, on June 12, 2020, Semes filed a second 
Motion to Dismiss [Count 5] for Failure to State an Offense, 
citing Baker (Second Motion to Dismiss).  In opposition, the 
State noted that the motion was procedurally improper, as Semes 
should have sought relief pursuant to Hawai# i Rules of Penal 
Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40, and argued that by pleading guilty to 
Count 5, Semes was precluded from challenging the charge on 
collateral review because the failure to allege an element of an offense is a non-jurisdictional defect.  After a hearing on the motion, the Circuit Court entered the Order Denying Second Motion to Dismiss, and this appeal followed. 
We review the Order Denying Second Motion to Dismiss as 
a denial of a nonconforming HRPP Rule 40 petition. 
As argued by the State, pursuant to a plea agreement 
that included the dismissal of certain counts against Semes, Semes pleaded guilty to the remaining counts, including Count 5. Semes thereafter moved to dismiss Count 5 for failure to allege an element of the offense after his guilty plea. 
"[A] guilty plea made voluntarily and intelligently 
precludes a defendant from later asserting any nonjurisdictional claims, including constitutional challenges to the pretrial proceedings."  State v. Morin, 71 Haw. 159, 162, 785 P.2d 1316, 1318 (1990).  The omission of an element of an offense is a nonjurisdictional claim.  Schwartz v. State, 136 
Hawai# i 258, 
282, 361 P.3d 1161, 1185 (2015) ("[T]he failure of a charging 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
instrument to allege an element of an offense does not constitute 
a jurisdictional defect that fails to confer subject-matter jurisdiction to the district court.").  The Second Motion to Dismiss, which sought dismissal of Count 5 for failure to include an element of the offense, raised a nonjurisdictional claim. Thus, we conclude that the Circuit Court did not err in denying the Second Motion to Dismiss.  
Accordingly, the Circuit Court's August 4, 2020 Order 
Denying Second Motion to Dismiss is affirmed.
