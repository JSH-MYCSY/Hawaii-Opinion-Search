NO. CAAP-20-0000551 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI#I 
STATE OF HAWAI#I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
ROBERTA WILBORN, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CR. NO. 1CPC-19-0000658) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and Nakasone, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record in CAAP-20-0000551, it 
appears this court lacks appellate jurisdiction. 
On August 7, 2020, the Circuit Court issued an Order 
Pertaining to Bail which set Defendant-Appellant Roberta Wilson's 
(Appellant) bail at $200,000.00. 
On September 8, 2020, Appellant, pro se, filed a Notice 
of Appeal to Bench Warrant and Order to Arrest. In her Notice of Appeal, Appellant stated "I am appealing to the vindictive bench warrant of $200,000 Thousand Dollar." Appellant did not file a Statement of Jurisdiction. It appears Appellant appeals from the August 7, 2020 Order Pertaining to Bail because she believes the bail is excessive. 
"Any party aggrieved by the judgment of a circuit court 
in a criminal matter may appeal to the intermediate appellate court, subject to chapter 602, in the manner and within the time provided by the rules of court. The sentence of the court in a criminal case shall be the judgment." Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-11 (2016). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Appellant has not been convicted and sentenced as there 
has been no trial yet. The proceeding has also not otherwise 
been terminated by an order leaving nothing further to be accomplished by the trial court. State v. Nicol, 140 
Hawai#i 
482, 492, 403 P.3d 259, 269 (2017). Therefore, the Order Pertaining to Bail is not appealable pursuant to HRS ยง 641-11. 
Appellant can assert bail was excessive in violation of 
her rights after entry of a judgment of conviction and sentence. State v. Visitin, 143 
Hawai#i 143, 150, 162-63, 426 P.3d 367, 
374, 386-87 (2018) (constitutional right to bail was not violated). In the alternative, Appellant may seek immediate relief by way of a petition for writ of mandamus, Hawai# i Supreme 
Court. Pelekai v. White, 75 Haw. 357, 362, 861 P.2d 1205, 1207 (1993); Sakamoto v. Won Bae Chang, 56 Haw. 447, 448-49, 539 P.2d 1197, 1198-99 (1975); Campiformio v. To# oto#o, SCPW-19-0000021 
(March 4, 2019), 2019 WL 1012090, at *1. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are 
dismissed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai#i, December 31, 2020.
