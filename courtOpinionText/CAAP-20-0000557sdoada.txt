THE LAW OFFICE OF DAVID B. ROSEN, ALC, Defendants-Appellees, 
DOES 1-10, Defendants. 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 2CC141000379(1))  
  
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka and McCullen, JJ.) 
Self-represented Plaintiff-Appellant Michael C. 
Greenspon appeals from the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit's 
August 11, 2020 Final Judgment, dismissing his case for failure to prosecute.
1  
In 2003, Greenspon obtained a $650,000.00 mortgage 
loan for a property in Ha‘ ikū, Maui (the Ha‘ikū Property). In 
2006, Greenspon modified the loan, increasing the principal 
1 The Honorable Rhonda I.L. Loo presided.   
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
amount to $800,000.00. In 2008, Greenspon was sent a notice 
stating that his loan was "in serious default" and that he must 
pay $27,664.44 on or before December 6, 2008 to cure the 
default. In 2010, the Ha‘ ikū Property was sold at a public non-
judicial foreclosure auction to Deutsche Bank National Trust 
Company, as Trustee. 
In June 2014, Greenspon filed a complaint under the 
pseudonym "Charles M. Brown" against Defendants-Appellees 
David B. Rosen, Esq. and Law Offices of David B. Rosen, ALC 
(together, Rosen Parties) claiming improper and illegal 
collection efforts following the non-judicial foreclosure. In 
December 2014, Greenspon filed a First Amended Complaint naming Defendant-Appellee CIT Bank N.A., f.k.a. Onewest Bank N.A., 
f.k.a. Onewest Bank, FSB (CIT) as an additional defendant, and 
raising nine claims: (1) negligent and intentional 
misrepresentation; (2) violation of Federal Fair Debt Collection
Practices Act under 15 U.S.C. § 1692; (3) violation of HRS 
Chapter 480D; (4) unfair and deceptive acts and practices under 
HRS Chapter 480; (5) negligence; (6) abuse of process; (7) intentional/negligent infliction of emotional distress; 
(8) damages; and (9) punitive and exemplary damages.  
In January 2015, CIT and Rosen Parties moved for a 
protective order, to stay the case, and to sanction Greenspon 
for his "improper, harassing, and abusive conduct" in refusing 
2   
 
  
 
  
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to withdraw his discovery requests (Motion for Stay). CIT and 
Rosen Parties further argued the case overlapped with the issues 
on appeal in CAAP-13-0001432 (Related Appeal), and they asked 
the circuit court to stay proceedings until the Related Appeal 
was resolved.2 
In March 2015 the circuit court stayed the case, 
ordering in a written order that: 
"this case is STAYED pending a final resolution in 
that appeal currently pending before the [Hawaiʻ i] 
Intermediate Court of Appeals in [the Related Appeal]. 
Consequently, all pending hearings are hereby removed from the Court's calendar, but may be re-scheduled upon the entry of an Order lifting this Stay." 
(Emphasis added.) See State v. Milne, 149 Hawai‘i 329, 335, 489 
P.3d 433, 439 (2021) (explaining that "a trial court's written 
order controls over its oral statements"). This court decided 
the Related Appeal in June 2016, and Greenspon's application for 
writ of certiorari was rejected in November 2016. See Greenspon
v. Deutsche Bank Nat'l Tr. Co., 138 Hawai‘ i 52, 375 P.3d 1290, 
No. CAAP-13-00001432, 2016 WL 3280366 (App. June 14, 2016) (mem. 
op.); Greenspon v. Deutsche Bank Nat'l Tr. Co., SCWC-13-0001432, 2016 WL 6879563 (Haw. Nov. 22, 2016) (Order). 
2 We take judicial notice of the files and records in CAAP- 13-0001432.  
See State v. Akana, 68 Haw. 164, 165, 706 P.2d 1300, 1302 (1985) (explaining 
that the court may take judicial notice of its own records in interrelated 
proceedings).

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Almost two years later, in October 2018, Rosen Parties 
filed a "Notice" of Greenspon's failure to comply with the Rules 
of the Circuit Court of the State of Hawaiʻi (RCCH) Rule 12(q), 
and requested the circuit court dismiss the case for lack of 
prosecution due to Greenspon's failure to file a pretrial 
statement or seek an extension, which the circuit court granted. 
The circuit court later granted Greenspon's motion for 
reconsideration, set aside the RCCH Rule 12(q) dismissal, and 
extended the deadline for Greenspon's pretrial statement to 
July 1, 2019, which Greenspon timely filed. 
In April 2020, CIT moved to dismiss the case for 
failure to prosecute pursuant to Hawaiʻi Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP) Rule 41(b)(1) and RCCH Rules 7, 12(c)(2), and 12(q). CIT argued Greenspon failed to request a trial setting conference within 60 days of filing his pretrial statement, as required 
under RCCH Rule 12(c)(2), and he had not done anything to 
advance the case besides filing a pretrial statement. Rosen 
Parties joined CIT's motion to dismiss. 
CIT also moved to designate Greenspon a vexatious 
litigant, arguing that: 
(1) Greenspon initiated and maintained 
thirteen separate civil actions arising from the same non-judicial foreclosure that raised overlapping claims against 
overlapping defendants; (2) Greenspon's related consolidated cases 2CC141000395 and 2CC141000560 were dismissed due to 
4   
 
   
 
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Greenspon's intentional disruption of discovery efforts; and 
(3) Greenspon was deemed a vexatious litigant in Florida for 
similar behavior.  
On June 7, 2020, Greenspon moved to (1) lift the stay 
and set the matter for trial or, in the alternative, 
(2) continue the stay pending the resolution of his other 
"related" cases in CAAP-19-0000391, 2CC171000090, 2CC141000395, 
and 2CC141000560. 
In July 2020, the circuit court entered written orders 
denying Greenspon's motion to lift the stay, granting CIT's motion to dismiss (Dismissal Order), and granting CIT's motion 
to designate Greenspon a vexatious litigant. The circuit court 
then entered a final judgment in favor of CIT and Rosen Parties 
and against Greenspon as to all claims in the first amended 
complaint. Greenspon timely appealed. 
On appeal, Greenspon raises five points of error 
(POE).
3 Of these points, only Greenspon's challenge to the 
3 Greenspon's five POE are as follows: 
1. "The circuit court's March 10, 2015 Stay order, R 46, premised on 
wrong conclusions, is legal error that caused years of prejudicial 
delay and obstruction of Appellant's meritorious claims in this case"; 
2. "The circuit court reversibly erred as a matter of law by its 
failure to grant [his] motions to consolidate, and to either lift 
the stay and set the case for trial or, alternatively, to continue the stay pending 'final resolution' of the related case appeals, and 
by ruling that [his] motion is 'moot'"; 
(continued . . .)

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
circuit court's dismissal of his first amended complaint (POE 3) 
has merit. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve the 
points of error as discussed below, and vacate and remand. 
The Dismissal Order dismissed all claims against CIT 
and Rosen Parties "for the reasons stated on the record at the hearing[.]" At the hearing, the circuit court found that 
Greenspon "failed to timely request a trial setting status 
conference pursuant to [RCCH] Rule 12(c)(2) and failed to move 
for relief from the stay or do anything else in the case, thus 
prejudicing the defendants," due to "almost four years of 
plaintiff being idle despite the active status of the case." 
The Dismissal Order also stated that Greenspon 
repeatedly failed to comply with deadlines, including the 
(. . . continued) 
3. "The circuit court reversibly erred as a matter of law by unjustly 
dismissing [his] entire FAC with prejudice premised on a[n] 
inadvertent oversight of RCCH Rule 12(c) and by making false and 
clearly erroneous findings and conclusions"; 
4. "The circuit court reversibly erred as a matter of law and grossly 
abused its discretion by granting Appellee's HRS § 634J motion"; and 
5. "The circuit court's conduct and systematic errors shows a pattern 
of bias[.] "  
(Formatting altered.) As to POE 1, the circuit court did not abuse its 
discretion in ordering a stay of the proceedings as there appear to be 
overlapping claims and parties, and based on our decision as to POE 3, we 
need not reach POE 2, 4, and 5. 
6

deadlines to file a pretrial statement under RCCH Rule 12(b), 
and to request a trial setting conference under RCCH 
Rule 12(c)(2); the case had not been stayed since the resolution 
of the Related Appeal, but to the extent Greenspon believed a 
stay was in place, he failed to move for relief from the stay or 
take any action in the case; Greenspon's delay prejudiced CIT 
and the Rosen Parties "as explained in their memoranda and 
supporting declarations, and is inexcusable"; and dismissal was proper under HRCP Rule 41(d).
4 
HRCP Rule 41(b)(1) provided that "a defendant may move 
for dismissal of an action or of any claim against it" if the 
plaintiff fails "to prosecute or to comply with these rules or 
any order of the court[.]" RCCH Rule 12(q), entitled "Dismissal 
for want of prosecution," provided that 
[a]n action may be dismissed sua sponte with written notice 
to the parties if a pretrial statement has not been filed 
within 8 months after a complaint has been filed (or within 
any further period of extension granted by the court) or if a trial setting status conference has not been scheduled as 
required by Rule 12(c). 
RCCH Rule 12(c)(2) required the plaintiff to schedule a trial 
setting status conference within sixty days of the pretrial 
statement. 
Here, the circuit court concluded no stay was in 
place. However, the stay order stated that "all pending

"Costs of previously- dismissed action," it appears HRCP Rule 41(b), entitled 
"Involuntary dismissal: Effect thereof," applies.

hearings are hereby removed from the Court's calendar, but may be re-scheduled upon the entry of an Order lifting this Stay." 
(Emphasis added.) The parties do not point to, and we could not 
find, where in the record there was entry of an order lifting 
the stay. As no order lifting the stay was entered, the stay 
remained in place. And, because the stay remained in place, the 
pretrial deadlines did not run and all filings (besides a motion 
for entry of an order to lift the stay) were improper. The circuit court thus abused its discretion in determining there 
was no stay in place and dismissing the case for failure to meet 
pretrial deadlines. 
Based on the foregoing, we vacate the circuit court's 
August 11, 2020 Final Judgment, and remand this case for further 
proceedings consistent with this summary disposition order.
