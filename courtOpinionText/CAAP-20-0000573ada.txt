(collectively, the County) appeal from the Circuit Court of the 
Fifth Circuit's2 (1) July 28, 2020 "Findings of Fact and 
Conclusions of Law, Decision and Order," and (2) August 24, 2020 Final Judgment in favor of Petitioners-Appellants-Appellees 
Elizabeth Kendrick and Joe Chaulklin. 
The County contends that the circuit court erred in 
reversing the Planning Commission's November 20, 2018 Findings 
of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Decision and Order (Planning Commission's Decision), which denied as untimely Kendrick and Chaulklin's application to renew their nonconforming use certificate for a transient vacation rental (or TVR).

We hold that the circuit court erred in reversing the 
Planning Commission's Decision. 
I. BACKGROUND 
Prior to 2008, the Kaua‘i County Code (KCC) allowed 
single-family residences to be used as transient vacation rentals. 
2 The Honorable Kathleen N.A. Watanabe presided. 
3 "'Transient vacation rental' means a dwelling unit which is provided 
to transient occupants for compensation or fees, including club fees, or as
part of interval ownership involving persons unrelated by blood, with a 
duration of occupancy of one hundred eighty (180) days or less." Kauaʻi 
County Code (KCC) § 8-1.5 (2008).

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
A. 2008 - Ordinance No. 864 
In 2008, the County adopted Ordinance No. 864, 
prohibiting transient vacation rentals outside of the Visitor 
Destination Area.4 KCC Title IV, Chapter 8, Article 17. 
The County Council found there was "a compelling need 
to regulate single-family transient vacation rentals on Kaua‘i" 
as they "are occurring at a greater rate and inflicting a larger 
impact on the community of Kaua‘ i than was ever anticipated[.]" 
Ord. No. 864, § 1 (2008). "Since 2000, out of the 2,050 new 
residential units, 1,070 have been built for the seasonal homes 
market and less than half have been for local families to rent 
(46) or own (936)." Id. "This also means that the limited 
available infrastructure and resources on Kaua‘ i, including 
roads, water, sewer capacity, building materials, and contractor 
time are being used primarily for expensive second or third homes rather than the primary home needs of local residents." Id. 
The County Council's goal was "to promote a high 
quality of life for all people on this island, to preserve the residential character of neighborhoods, to encourage the

Visitor Destination Areas on County of Kauaʻi zoning maps." Ord. No. 864, § 2 
(2008); see also

, 153 Hawai‘i 386, 390 n.5, 539 P.3d

as 'those areas designated as Visitor Destination Areas on County of Kaua‘ i 
zoning maps.'").

diversity of incomes and backgrounds that has made Kaua‘i a 
special place of aloha, and to promote health and safety and the 
general welfare[.]" Id.
Although Ordinance No. 864 prohibited transient 
vacation rentals outside of the Visitor Destination Area, it established a procedure for owners of a lawful transient vacation rental operating outside the Visitor Destination Area 
to obtain a nonconforming use certificate to continue operating 
their property as a transient vacation rental. 
KCC § 8-17.10(b) 
(2008). 
An owner who obtained a nonconforming use certificate 
was required to "apply to renew the nonconforming use certificate by July 31 for every year" with proof that certain conditions were met. KCC § 8-17.10(g) (2008). "Failure to meet these conditions [would] result in the denial of the application 
for renewal of the nonconforming use certificates." KCC § 8-
17.10(g)(2). 
Kendrick and Chaulklin own real 
Property in Anahola, 
Kaua‘i, and obtained a nonconforming use certificate, TVNCU 
#4308.5 
5 However, the 2015, 2016, and 2017 renewal applications identified
"Ginger Beach House, LLC" as the owner of the Property.

B. 2010 to 2014 - Amendments to KCC 
In 2010, Ordinance No. 904 amended KCC § 8-17.10 by 
changing the July 31 due date for renewals to "annually on the 
date of issuance of the non-conforming use certificate." KCC 
§ 8-17.10(h) (2010). This ordinance also made denial automatic 
stating, "[f]ailure to meet this condition [would] result in the automatic denial of the application for renewal of the nonconforming use certificates." Id.
In 2013, Ordinance No. 950 added that each application 
to renew with proof of the excise tax and transient accommodation licenses "shall be received by the Department prior to the expiration date of a held non-conforming use 
certificate." KCC § 8-17.10(h)(1) (approved July 23, 2013).

In 2014, Ordinance No. 974 increased the annual 
renewal fee from $500.00 to $750.00. KCC § 8-17.10(h) (approved 
6 Upon its approval, Ordinance No. 950 indicated KCC § 8- 17.10(h)(1) 
would read: 
(h) The owner or lessee who has obtained a 
nonconforming use certificate under this section shall 
apply to renew the nonconforming use certificate annually on the date of issuance of the nonconforming use
certificate. 
(1) Each application to r enew shall include 
proof that there is a currently valid State of Hawai‘ i 
general excise tax license and transient accommodations tax license for the Nonconforming use 
and shall be received by the Department pr ior to the 
expiration date of a held non- conforming use
certificate. Failure to meet this condition will 
result in the automatic denial of the application for
renewal of the nonconforming use certificates.

Sept. 30, 2014). Thus, the final version of KCC § 8-17.10(h) as 
relevant to this case provided: 
(h) The owner or lessee who has obtained a Nonconforming 
Use Certificate under this Section shall apply to renew the
Nonconforming Use Certificate annually on the date of
issuance of the Nonconforming Use Certificate. 
(1) Each application to renew shall include proof that 
there is a currently valid State of Hawai‘ i general 
excise tax license and transient accommodations 
tax license for the nonconforming use and shall be 
received by the Department prior to the expiration
date of a held Nonconforming Use Certificate. 
Failure to meet this condition will result in the automatic denial of the application for renewal of
the Nonconforming Use Certificates. 
 . . . . 
(3) The applicant shall pay an annual renewal fee of
seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) which shall
be deposited into the County General Fund. 
Id. (formatting altered and emphases added). 
C. 2015 - Timely Application 
In 2015, Kendrick and Chaulklin timely applied to 
renew their nonconforming use certificate, with the Planning Department receiving their application on November 25, 2015, ahead of the December 12, 2015 annual renewal date. The 
application indicated Kendrick's email address was 
"BETH@VSE.COM." A November 25, 2015 letter from the Planning Department approved the application and explained the nonconforming use certificate was renewed to December 12, 2016. The letter made no mention of a grace period.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
D. 2016 - Warnings and Timely Application 
Less than three months later, on February 9, 2016, 
Mike Laureta, Planning Department Program Manager, sent an email 
to "beth@vse.com" and others warning that untimely or incomplete 
applications for renewal would not be accepted: 
Subject: FW: 2016 TVR Renewal 
For the past several years, the Department has strongly
encouraged the submittal of complete TVR renewal packets at 
least two months prior to the renewal date. Last year,there were 6 who missed the deadline, and submitted their 
renewal packets within 1- 30 days after the renewal date. 
This cost them $1,500 + 750. There were 2 who completely
forgot to renew, and are now appealing the forfeiture. 
By this email, I am giving fair warning - Ordinance 
No. 950, Sec. 8- 17-10(h)(1) removed the ability to reapply 
for renewal if you failed to timely renew. This means -
from here going forward, if you're 1 day late, the
Department will issue you a forfeiture notice. If you 
don't run your business in a professional manner and forget
to timely renew, no excuse will be good enough. 
If the renewal packet is incomplete beyond the renewal
date, the Department will issue a Forfeiture notice. It's 
incumbent on the certificate holders to provide all the
documents listed on the renewal form - we will no longer 
chase you for missing documents. At the time you submit
your packet, it had better be complete. You should all know what is expected during the renewal process,especially those with Special Permits. This includes a 
hard copy of all the websites you advertise on, reflecting 
at a minimum, your TVRNCU number and 24/7 on island contact. 
I will be sending this email to all, in groups of maybe 25.
So if you get this more than once, you really better not 
miss a renewal date...... 
(Ellipsis in original and underline added.) 
Kendrick and Chaulklin submitted a timely renewal 
application on November 8, 2016, ahead of the December 12, 2016 
annual renewal date. On November 16, 2016, the Planning 
7    
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Department approved the renewal application and explained that 
the nonconforming use certificate was renewed to December 12, 2017. 
The renewal letter also advised that renewal 
applications must be made prior to the annual renewal date or the Planning Department would issue a "Cease & Desist and Notice of Forfeiture": 
Your TVNCU is renewed to December 12, 2017 based on 
the information submitted. Your file is active and 
current. Please be advised that in order to keep your Non-Conforming Use Certificate valid, you must: 
1. Apply for renewal every year, no less than thirty (30) days, and up to two months, prior to 
the annual renewal date of December 12, 2017, 
utilizing the most current renewal form on our website, and the renewal fee existing at that
time (presently $750). Should your renewal be 
at least one (1) day late, you will be served 
with a Cease & Desist and Notice of Forfeiture. Should your renewal be incomplete, it will not 
be processed and will be returned to you via 
USPS. The resubmittal of the complete applicat ion must be before the renewal date.  
The only supporting documents we will accept after the renewal date is your tax documents that are filed on an extension. . . . 
E. 2017 - Untimely Application 
In 2017, Kendrick submitted an application and a 
$750.00 check, both dated December 15, 2017, and received by the 
Planning Department on December 20, 2017. Because the application was submitted after the December 12, 2017 renewal date, the Planning Department denied the application.

Kendrick and Chaulklin admitted their application was 
submitted "'after the deadline set by the Planning Department.'" 
They contested the denial of their untimely renewal application. F. Contested Case Hearing, Oral Arguments, and Circuit Court 
Appeal 
Following a contested case hearing, the hearing 
officer made findings and conclusions, and recommended the 
Planning Commission affirm the Planning Department's decision 
denying the renewal application because Kendrick and Chaulklin 
"have not met their burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence establishing that this decision of the Planning Department was based on an erroneous finding of a material fact, or the Planning Director had acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner, or had manifestly abused his discretion." 
The Planning Commission heard oral arguments, and 
issued its findings and conclusions, and decision and order 
affirming the Planning Department's decision for the reasons set 
forth by the hearing officer. 
Kendrick and Chaulklin appealed to the circuit court. 
Following oral arguments, the circuit court reversed the Planning Commission and remanded the case to the Planning Department "to timely accept and promptly process Appellants'

renewal application for 2017 and affected subsequent years." 7 
The County appealed. 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
In a secondary appeal, the circuit court reviews the 
agency decision de novo under the right/wrong standard. 
See Dao
v. Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Honolulu, 144 Hawaiʻ i 28, 38, 434 
P.3d 1223, 1233 (App. 2019). 
Hawaiʻi Revised Statues (
HRS) § 91-14(g) (Supp. 2019) 
provides: 
(g) Upon review of the record the court may affirm 
the decision of the agency or remand the case with 
instructions for further proceedings; or it may reverse ormodify the decision and order if the substantial rights of the petitioners may have been prejudiced because the 
administrative findings, conclusions, decisions, or orders 
are: 
(1) In violation of constitutional or statutoryprovisions; 
(2) In excess of the statutory authority orjurisdiction of the agency; 
(3) Made upon unlawful procedure; 
(4) Affected by other error of law; 
7 The County also challenges various findings in the circuit court's 
July 28, 2020 "Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, Decision and Order." On the other hand, Kendrick and Chaulklin assert all the circuit court' s 
findings not challenged are binding on this court. 
However, when a circuit court acts as an appellate court, it may not
make its own findings of fact. Sierra Club v. Bd. of L and & Nat. Res., 154 
Hawai‘i 264, 284, 550 P.3d 230, 250 (App. 2024), cert. granted, No. SCWC- 22-
0000516, 2024 WL 3378462 (July 
11, 2024) (explaining the circuit court 
reviewing an agency's decision under Hawaiʻi Revised Statues (HRS) § 91-14 
acts as an appellate court and does not make findings of fact, cannot consider the weight of the evidence, or pass upon the credibility ofwitnesses). 
Thus, we do not consider the circuit court's findings of fact, but
review the agency's decision pursuant to HRS 
§ 91-14.

(5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, 
probative, and substantial evidence on the wholerecord; or 
(6) Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized byabuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion. 
"In a secondary appeal, '[t]his court's review is further 
qualified by the principle that the agency's decision carries a 
presumption of validity and [the party challenging the agency's decision] has the heavy burden of making a convincing showing that the decision is invalid . . . .'" Keep the North Shore

of Haw. v. Sullivan, 87 Hawai‘ i 217, 229, 953 P.2d 1315, 1327 
(1998)). 
III. DISCUSSION 
On appeal, the County contends the circuit court 
"gravely erred in reversing" the Planning Commission's decision. 
Kendrick and Chaulklin contend denial of their renewal application violated state and county law, and their due process rights. Here, the circuit court erred because the Planning 
Commission did not violate state or county law and did not 
violate Kendrick and Chaulklin's due process rights. A. State and County Laws Were Not Violated 
On appeal to the circuit court, Kendrick and Chaulklin 
asked, "[d]id the Planning Commission violate state statute and

county ordinance when it concluded [they] 'forfeited' their 
[nonconforming use certificate] even though they never discontinued their nonconforming use of the property?" 
In 
particular, they argued the Planning Department violated HRS 
§ 46-4(a) (Supp. 2017) and KCC § 8-13.2(a) when it denied their 
renewal application, challenging the Planning Commission's conclusion of law (COL) 15.
  8
In their answering brief on further appeal to this 
court, they argue there is no finding that they "discontinued use of their nonconforming" transient vacation rental, and 
8COL 15 states: 
15. When keeping in mind the purpose of 
Haw. Rev. 
Stat. § 46-4 which is to empower the counties to enact
zoning ordinances allowing and encouraging the most 
beneficial use of the land consonant with good zoningpractices, and c onstruing it in a manner consistent with 
that purpose, the zoning mandate of KCC § 8- 17.10, as 
commissioned by Haw. Rev. Stat. § 46- 4(a), is to be
liberally construed to permit the nonconforming use of the Subject Property to continue provided TVNCU #4308 is maintained and registered with the Planning Department 
pursuant to KCC § 8- 17(h). See generally In the Interest 
of CM, 141 
Hawaiʻi at 353, 409 P.3d at 757 ("What is clear 
in one statute [(i.e. KCC § 8- 17.10(h))] may be called upon 
in aid to explain what is d oubtful in another [(i.e. Haw. 
Rev. Stat. § 46-4(a))]."). If such registration lapses as
in this Contested Case, the nonconforming use is no longera lawful use because the Subject Property lacks a "Nonconforming Use Certificate for [that] single familyvacation rental". KCC § 8- 17.l0(b) and Cf. Waikiki 
Marketplace. Inv. Co. v. Chair of Zoning of Appeals of the 
C&C of Honolulu, 86 Hawaiʻ i 343, 356, 949 P.2d 183, 196

as used in HRS § 46-4 and the LUO, refer to compliance with 
previous zoning laws, not the building codes or other legal 
requirements that may be applicable to the construction or 
operation of a structure.").

assert they used the transient vacation rental "throughout the 
year prior to its December 12 renewal deadline." 
HRS § 46-4 vests counties with their zoning power. 
Kaiser Haw. Kai Dev. Co. v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 70 Haw. 
480, 483, 777 P.2d 244, 246 (1989). HRS § 46-4 requires that 
zoning "shall be accomplished within the framework of a long-range, comprehensive general plan prepared or being prepared to guide the overall future development of the county." HRS § 46-4(a). Each county is allowed to adopt regulations to carry out the purposes of HRS § 46-4 and "shall prescribe rules, regulations, and administrative procedures and provide personnel it finds necessary to enforce this section and any ordinance 
enacted in accordance with this section." Id.
"The ordinances may be enforced by appropriate fines 
and penalties, civil or criminal, or by court order at the suit 
of the county or the owner or owners of real estate directly affected by the ordinances." Id.The zoning powers "shall be 
liberally construed in favor of the county exercising them, and in such a manner as to promote the orderly development of each county or city and county in accordance with a long-range, 
comprehensive general plan to ensure the greatest benefit for 
the State as a whole." Id.
13    
 
 
 
   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Importantly, HRS § 46-4(a) protects the existing 
lawful use of a building or premises: 
Neither this section nor any ordinance enacted 
pursuant to this section shall prohibit the continued
lawful use of any building or premises for any trade, industrial, residential, agricultural, or other purpose for
which the building or premises is used at  the time this 
section or the ordinance takes effect; provided that a 
zoning ordinance may provide for elimination ofnonconforming uses as the uses are discontinued, or for the amortization or phasing out of nonconforming uses or signs
over a reasonable period of time in commercial, industrial,
resort, and apartment zoned areas only. In no event shall such amortization or phasing out of nonconforming usesapply to any existing building or premises used for residential (single- family or duplex) or agricultural uses.  
Id. 
Turning to the KCC, Chapter 8 is Kauai's zoning 
ordinance. Article 13 of the zoning ordinance generally 
addresses nonconforming structures and uses, and Article 17 of the zoning ordinance specifically addresses transient vacation rentals as nonconforming uses. 
Generally, as provided in Article 13, a nonconforming 
use "may continue to the extent that the use existed on September 1, 1972" but "[i]f any nonconforming use ceases for 
any reason for [a] continuous period of 12 calendar months or 
for one season if the use be seasonal, then the use shall not be resumed and any use of the land or building thereafter shall be in full conformity with the provisions of this Chapter." KCC § 8-13.2(a), (b) (2012). 
14    
 
 
 
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Specifically, as provided in Article 17, nonconforming 
use certificates for transient vacation rentals may be obtained 
and renewed annually. KCC § 8-17.10. As discussed above, KCC § 8-17.10 requires an owner "who has obtained a Nonconforming 
Use Certification under this Section . . . to renew the 
Nonconforming Use Certificate annually on the date of issuance of the Nonconforming Use Certificate." KCC § 8-17.10(h) (emphasis added). 
"Each application to renew . . . shall be received by 
the Department prior to the expiration date of a held Nonconforming Use Certificate" and "[f]ailure to meet this condition will result in the automatic denial of the application 
for renewal of the Nonconforming Use Certificates." KCC § 8-
17.10(h)(1). 
To the extent Kendrick and Chaulklin rely on KCC § 8-
13.2(a) and (b) as the only means by which a nonconforming use may cease, their reliance is misplaced. There is no language in KCC § 8-13.2(a) and (b) preventing the County from separately regulating nonconforming use certificates for transient vacation rentals. And even if they were in conflict, KCC § 8-17.10 
specifically applying to the renewal of nonconforming use 
certificates for transient vacation rentals would trump. Cf.
Richardson v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu
, 76 Hawai‘i 46, 54-55, 868

P.2d 1193, 1201-02 (1994) (noting in part, "where there is a 
'plainly irreconcilable' conflict between a general and a specific statute concerning the same subject matter, the specific will be favored") (citation omitted). 
Moreover, holders of nonconforming use certificates 
obtained under KCC § 8-17.10 must reapply annually prior to the expiration date of the nonconforming use certificate. Thus, if a nonconforming use certificate was issued pursuant to KCC § 8-17.10, the provisions of KCC § 8-17.10 apply. Kendrick and Chaulklin make no assertions that their TVNCU #4308 nonconforming use certificate for use as a transient vacation rental was not issued pursuant to KCC § 8-17.10 governing 
transient vacation rentals. 
Finally, the 2016 letter approving the renewal of the 
nonconforming use certificate for TVNCU #4308 stated, "Your 
TVNCU is renewed to December 12, 2017[.]" Thus, on December 13, 2017, there was no nonconforming use certificate to renew. When Kendrick and Chaulklin sent in the renewal form and check dated December 15, 2017, which the Planning Department received on December 20, 2017, the Planning Department was obligated to deny 
the application as there was no existing nonconforming use 
certificate to renew.

In sum, the Planning Commission did not violate HRS 
§ 46-4(a) and KCC § 8-13.2(a) when it affirmed the Planning 
Department's decision to deny the untimely renewal application. The Planning Commission's mixed finding and conclusion in COL 15 
(providing in part that "[i]f such registration lapses as in 
this Contested Case, the nonconforming use is no longer a lawful use because the Subject Property lacks a 'Nonconforming Use Certificate for [that] single family vacation rental") was not clearly erroneous. (Some brackets in original.) B. Due Process Rights Were Not Violated 
For their due process argument, Kendrick and Chaulklin 
contend (1) they did not receive sufficient notice of the 
elimination of the thirty-day grace period, (2) the Planning 
Department's refusal of their untimely renewal interfered with their "constitutionally protected vested right to continue their lawful nonconforming use," and (3) they were not provided an opportunity to brief the alternate reason given by the Planning Commission.

1. Notice Before the circuit court, Kendrick and Chaulklin 
contended they should be given a thirty-day grace period 
pursuant to the 2014 Interpretive Rules. They argued they had no notice of the elimination of the thirty-day grace period, or in the alternative, inaccurate notice. 
They further argued, as 
they do before this court, that the new rules cannot be applied retrospectively. Contrary to their argument, Kendrick and Chaulklin were not denied due process based on insufficient 
notice. 
Effective April 25, 2014, the Planning Commission 
adopted KPAR-8-19-1, its administrative rule for "Transient 
18    
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Accommodation Units[.]" (Formatting altered.) The Planning 
Commission found that the annual renewal process lacked specificity, including where there was a late filing: 
The requirements of the Chapter 8, Article 17 of the KCC 
lack specificity pertaining to the annual renewal process, including late filing, the documentation and evidencerequired to maintain a non- conforming use as defined in KCC 
Section 8- 13, and the procedures necessary for a 
certificate holder to seek due process in the event of anon-renewal. 
KPAR-8-19-1 FINDINGS. The rule then afforded late filers a 
thirty-day grace period and charged an administrative processing 
fee of twice the renewal fee: 
"Late Renewal Applications. Renewal applications 
received by the Planning Department within thirty 
days (30) after the deadline may renew, provided that in addition to the renewal fee, a 
certificate holder shall pay an administrative 
processing fee of twice the renewal fee." 
KPAR-8-19-1(1)(F) (2014).
9 But "[a]fter the thirtieth (30th) day 
after the renewal deadline, the Department shall reject any 
renewal application and issue a forfeiture letter." KPAR-8-19-1(1)(E) (2014). 
However, this rule directly conflicted with the plain 
language of KCC § 8-17.10(h) (2013), the ordinance in effect when the rule was approved. KCC § 8-17.10(h) (2013) required 
the renewal application and proof be received prior to the 
expiration date otherwise the application would be denied: 
9 We note there are two subsections labeled "F", and the subsection 
which we refer to is the first subsection "F".

  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(h) The owner or lessee who has obtained a 
nonconforming use certificate under this section shall 
apply to renew the n onconforming use certificate annually 
on the date of issuance of the n onconforming use 
certificate. 
(1) Each application to renew shall include 
proof that there is a currently valid State of Hawai‘ i 
general excise tax license and transient
accommodations tax license for the N onconforming use 
and shall be received by the Department prior to the
expiration date of a held non-conforming use 
certificate. Failure to meet this condition will
result in the automatic denial of the application for 
renewal of the n onconforming use certificates. 
KCC § 8-17.10(h) (emphases added). 
Because the thirty-day grace period directly 
conflicted with the ordinance, the ordinance controlled. Cf.
Aregger v. Dep't of Tax'n
, 124 Hawai‘i 325, 329, 243 P.3d 285, 
289 (App. 2010) (explaining "where there is a conflict between a 
court rule and a statute, the statute is controlling"); 
see 
generally Robert D. Ferris Tr. v. Plan. Comm'n of Cnty. of
Kauaʻi
, 138 Hawai‘i 307, 310, 378 P.2d 1023, 1026 (App. 2016) 
(noting general principles of statutory construction apply to 
municipal ordinances). 
Effective November 23, 2017, the Planning Commission 
amended KPAR-8-19-1 to remove the thirty-day grace period and clarify that failure to submit a timely renewal application would result in denial of the application: 
20    
 
 
 
  
 
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"Late Renewal Applications.  Failure to submit an 
application to renew the [nonconforming use 
certificate] by the [nonconforming use 
certificate]'s expiration date will result in the 
automatic denial of the application. The 
Planning Department shall not accept applications 
submitted after the expiration date." 
KPAR-8-19-1(C) (2017). 
Thus, even if the thirty-day grace period was not 
invalid, by the time Kendrick and Chaulklin's application to 
renew was due, the rules did not provide for a thirty-day grace period. And because the rule without a thirty-day grace period was in effect at the time Kendrick and Chaulklin's application to renew was due, it was not applied retroactively. 
As for notice of the change in the rule, the amended 
rule shows there was: 
(1) "PUBLIC NOTICE: August 22, 2017 (Posted with the Office of County Clerk)"; 
(2) "August 22, 2017 (Publications, Garden Island Newspaper and Star Advertiser)"; and 
(3) "PUBLIC HEARING: September 26, 2017." 
As for notice of the KCC § 8-17.10(h) requirement to 
file a timely renewal application, in addition to the plain 
language of the ordinance, on February 9, 2016, Laureta sent an 
email to Kendrick's email address as listed on her 2016 (and 
21    
 
 
 
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2017) renewal application, "beth@vse.com", warning that untimely 
or incomplete applications for renewal would not be accepted. 
Based on the foregoing, Kendrick and Chaulklin were 
not denied due process based on insufficient notice. 
2. Vested Property Rights On appeal to the circuit court, Kendrick and Chaulklin 
contended that the "Planning Department's Forfeiture Letter and denial of [their nonconforming use certificate] renewal packet denied [them of] their right to due process of the law and interfered with valuable and protected private property rights because [they] have a constitutionally protected vested right to continue their lawful nonconforming use." 
In their answering brief to this court, Kendrick and 
Chaulklin argue they "proved their lawful nonconforming use by registering it," and "because the right to continue a nonconforming use arises from Hawaii's zoning enabling act and constitutional protections and not from regulatory provisions, the right cannot be lost by a county ordinance or rule." 
Again, "[t]he counties of the state of Hawai‘ i 'derive 
their zoning powers from HRS § 46–4(a) . . . , referred to as 
the Zoning Enabling Act.'" Ferris
, 138 Hawai‘i at 312, 378 P.3d 
at 1028 (citation omitted). HRS § 46-4(a) provides in pertinent 
part, "[n]either this section nor any ordinance enacted pursuant 
22    
 
 
 
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to this section shall prohibit the continued lawful use of any 
building or premises for any trade, industrial, residential, agricultural, or other purpose for which the building or premises is used at the time this section or the ordinance takes 
effect[.]" 
"Under the United States and Hawai‘ i Constitutions, 
'preexisting lawful uses of property are generally considered to be vested rights that zoning ordinances may not abrogate.'" 
Ferris, 138 Hawai‘ i at 312, 378 P.3d at 1028 (citation omitted). 
But "[e]ven with respect to vested property rights, a 
legislature generally has the power to impose new regulatory 
constraints on the way in which those rights are used, or to condition their continued retention on performance of certain affirmative duties." U.S. v. Locke, 471 U.S. 84, 104 (1985); 
see generally Save Sunset Beach Coal. v. City & Cnty. of
Honolulu
, 102 Hawai‘i 465, 474, 78 P.3d 1, 10 (2003) ("[A] 
zoning ordinance is a legislative act and is subject to the 
deference given legislative acts."). "As long as the constraint or duty imposed is a reasonable restriction designed to further legitimate legislative objectives, the legislature acts within 
its powers in imposing such new constraints or duties." 
Locke
, 
471 U.S. at 104.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Supreme Court of the United States has "upheld the 
power of the State to condition the retention of a property 
right upon the performance of an act within a limited period of time" and explained that a taking does not occur where the 
government is not required "to compensate the owner for the 
consequences of his own neglect." Texaco, Inc. v. Short, 454 U.S. 516, 529-30 (1982); see also Bd. of Zoning Appeals,Bloomington Ind. v. Leisz, 702 N.E.2d 1026, 1031 (Ind. 1998) ("The power to protect the property interest rests solely with the landowner."). 
Here, the County General Plan called for enacting 
"clear standards and permit processes for regulating alternative 
visitor accommodation structures and operations in Residential, 
Agriculture, Open, and Resort zoning districts." Ord. No. 864, § 1. The County General Plan also provided that the "[p]ermitting process should consider the cumulative impact that a large concentration of alternative visitor units can have on a residential neighborhood." Id.
In line with the County General Plan, the County 
Council found "the uncontrolled proliferation of vacation 
rentals in residential and other areas outside the Visitor 
Destination Area . . . is causing significant negative impacts to certain residential neighborhoods[.]" Id.

The ordinance provided a process to identify and 
register pre-existing lawful transient vacation rentals as non-
conforming uses. Id. § 11. The renewal process requires proof 
of a valid Hawai‘i general excise tax license and a transient 
accommodations tax license, and allows re-inspection of the 
property to ensure compliance with other provisions of the chapter. KCC § 8-17.10. Imposing an affirmative duty on the 
holders of the nonconforming use permit to submit their renewal 
application on time establishes a reasonable and efficient process by which the County is able to receive the necessary documents and ensure compliance with the chapter. 
Hawai‘i courts are directed to liberally construe the 
powers granted to counties under HRS § 46-4(a) in favor of the counties and in a manner "to promote the orderly development of each county . . . in accordance with a long-range, comprehensive general plan to ensure the greatest benefit for the State as a whole." 
HRS § 46-4(a). And this court has previously 
determined that the "express purpose of KCC § 8-17.10 . . . is 
consistent with the requirements of HRS § 46-4(a) as well as the 
constitutional protection provided to property owners with vested rights to pre-existing lawful uses of their property."

Thus, the Planning Commission did not abrogate or 
interfere with Kendrick and Chaulklin's vested rights when it 
denied their untimely renewal application. 
3. Alternate Theory 
On appeal to the circuit court, Kendrick and Chaulklin 
contended the Planning Commission relied on an alternate theory 
"to deny Appellants' renewal packet" when it concluded that "even if the [thirty-day] Grace Period [associated with the 2014 Interpretive Rules] were available to Petitioners, their Renewal Application was incomplete when received by the Planning Department on December 21, 2017 because it did not include the administrative processing fee."
10 (Footnote omitted.) Kendrick 
and Chaulklin argued that this violated their "right to due process because the Planning Department only gave one reason for denying the renewal packet, that it was untimely." As a result, Kendrick and Chaulklin contended that they "were never given the opportunity to brief that subject on appeal to the Planning Commission." 
However, the attorney for Kendrick and Chaulklin 
raised the issue in oral argument before the Planning 
Commission. For context, the thirty-day grace period rule 
imposed an "administrative processing fee of twice the renewal 
10 The December 21, 2017 letter from the Planning Department states
they received the renewal document packet on December 20, 2017. 
26    
 
 
 
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
fee." KPAR-8-19-1 (2014). Thus, if Kendrick and Chaulklin were 
genuinely relying on the thirty-day grace period when they sent their untimely application and check to the Planning Department, they presumably would have included the mandatory administrative 
processing fee, which they did not. In any event, as mentioned, 
Kendrick and Chaulklin had an opportunity to address this issue in their oral argument before the Planning Commission.

July 28, 2020 "Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, Decision and Order" and August 24, 2020 Final Judgment, and affirm the November 20, 2018 Planning Commission Decision. On the briefs: /s/ Keith K. Hiraoka
