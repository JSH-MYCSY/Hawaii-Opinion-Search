APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 2CC191000153) 
MEMORANDUM OPINION 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and Guidry, JJ.) 
These consolidated appeals come from a wrongful 
foreclosure lawsuit filed by several plaintiffs against Bank of 
America, N.A. ( BANA) and others in the Circuit Court of the 
Second Circuit.  Bernardo Panuelos , Michael J. Hillinger and 
Lisa M. Hillinger (the Hillingers ), and Jacqueline Bui appeal 
from Hawai #i Rules of Civil Procedure ( HRCP) Rule 54(b)-certified
Judgments  for BANA, each entered on August 26, 2020.  They 
challenge the circuit court's August 11, 2020 " Order Granting 
Defendants Bank of America, N.A. and Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc.'s Motion to Dismiss First Amended 21

2 Barbara J.K. Duarte was also an appellant, but her appeal has been
dismissed by stipulation.

Complaint and Motion to Sever, Filed February 21, 2020, and 
Substantive Joinders by Joining Defendants." We vacate the Judgments, affirm in part and vacate in part the Order, and remand for further proceedings. 
I. BACKGROUND
 BANA nonjudicially foreclosed on several properties 
owned by various plaintiffs below. The plaintiffs claim the foreclosures didn't comply with former Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 667-5.
3 They sought damages for wrongful foreclosure and 
lost rental income, treble damages under HRS § 480-13, restitution, and rescissory or other equitable damages. Some plaintiffs also sought to quiet title to, and regain possession of, their foreclosed properties. 
BANA moved to dismiss the lawsuit or to sever the 
plaintiffs' cases. The circuit court dismissed all claims made by Panuelos, the Hillingers, and Bui, and severed the remaining plaintiffs' cases. 
HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified judgments were 
entered against Panuelos, the Hillingers, and Bui. We consolidated their appeals. The parties submitted supplemental briefs on several supreme court decisions published after briefing for these appeals had been completed, including Llanes 
v. Bank of Am., N.A., ___ Hawai #i ___, ___ P.3d ___, 2024 WL 
3064621 (as amended on recon., Sept. 9, 2024); In re Manuel, 152 
Hawai
#i 290, 526 P.3d 267 (2023); and Delapinia  v. Nationstar 
Mortg. LLC, 150 Hawai #i 91, 497 P.3d 106 (2021). 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW 
We review a ruling on a motion to dismiss de novo. 
Bank of Am., N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo , 143 Hawai #i 249, 256, 428 P.3d 
761, 768 (2018). 
We assume the facts alleged in the complaint 
are true and view them in the light most favorable to the

plaintiffs to determine if they warrant relief under any legal 
theory. Id. at 257, 428 P.3d at 769. But we don't have to accept conclusory allegations on the legal effect of the facts alleged. Kealoha v. Machado, 131 
Hawai#i 62, 74, 315 P.3d 213, 
225 (2013). If the circuit court's decision was correct, "it must be affirmed . . . even though the lower tribunal gave the wrong reason for its action." 
State v. Taniguchi , 72 Haw. 235, 
239, 815 P.2d 24, 26 (1991). 
III. 
DISCUSSION 
The factual allegations in the First Amended Complaint, 
viewed in light most favorable to Panuelos, the Hillingers, and Bui (collectively, Plaintiffs ), are: Plaintiffs owned real 
property on Maui. Between 2008 and 2011, BANA held nonjudicial foreclosure sales under former HRS § 667-5 in a way that increased the likelihood of BANA being the successful bidder at the auction. That enabled BANA to continue earning servicing fees while holding the foreclosed property for resale. BANA's nonjudicial foreclosures did not comply with HRS § 667-5 in several ways described in the First Amended Complaint. 
As to damages, the First Amended Complaint alleged: 
28. As a result of BANA's wrongful conduct in
foreclosing, each Plaintiff lost title and possession and
use of their real property in an unlawful sale in the samemanner as part of the same common scheme. 
29. As a result of the wrongful acts described
above, each Plaintiff lost the monies they had invested orexpended in their Property, lost the market value of theirProperty, lost the use and rental value of the Property fromand after the date he or she lost possession, and incurredother losses related to obtaining alternative properties,all in amounts they are entitled to recover and to be provedat trial. Such recovery may be at law, in equity, byrestitution, equitable or rescissory damages. 
The First Amended Complaint did not allege that 
Plaintiffs' mortgages did not contain a power of sale, or that 
Plaintiffs were not subject to foreclosure. Plaintiffs did not 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
challenge BANA's right to foreclose; they complained that BANA 
did not follow proper procedure when it did. 
In these appeals: (a) Panuelos and the Hillingers 
contend the circuit court erroneously concluded their claims were barred by HRS § 501-118; (b) Panuelos, the Hillingers, and Bui 
contend the court erroneously concluded that their claims for restitution or rescissory damages, and for specific violations of HRS Chapter 667, Part I, were time-barred; (c) Bui contends the 
circuit court erroneously concluded she was judicially estopped from pursuing her claims and (d) her quiet title and ejectment 
claims were time-barred; and (e) Panuelos, the Hillingers, and 
Bui contend the circuit court abused its discretion by severing the plaintiffs' cases after erroneously concluding they didn't arise from the same series of transactions. 
A. Panuelos's and the Hillingers' claims for
damages are not barred by HRS § 501-118. 
Panuelos's and the Hillingers' properties were 
registered in Land Court. The Land Court Assistant Registrar had 
entered post-foreclosure transfer certificates of title in the registration book on February 9, 2016 — three years before the First Amended Complaint was filed. The circuit court concluded that Panuelos's and the Hillingers' claims were barred by HRS § 501-118 because they weren't filed before new certificates of title were entered. 
Manuel is dispositive. The supreme court held: 
[A]n action alleging a wrongful nonjudicial foreclosure of
Land Court property that seeks only damages against theforeclosing lender is not an action that "directlyimpeaches" any foreclosure proceedings affecting registeredland within the meaning of HRS § 501-118(c); therefore, theaction is not barred by the entry of a [transfer certificateof title] to the buyer at a foreclosure sale. 
Id. 152 Hawai#i at 303, 526 P.3d at 280. 
In these cases, Panuelos and the Hillingers seek only 
recovery of damages from BANA; they don't seek return of title to 
or possession of their foreclosed properties. 
Their claims for 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
damages were not barred by HRS § 501-118. The circuit court 
erred by dismissing their claims on that basis. Their claims for damages are, however, limited by the supreme court's recent Llanes decision (as amended on reconsideration). 
B. The claims for restitution or rescissory
damages and for specific violations of HRSChapter 667, Part I were subject to classaction tolling. 
Panuelos, the Hillingers, and Bui joined the action 
below when the First Amended Complaint was filed on May 3, 2019. 
They were members of the putative class in Degamo v. Bank of Am., N.A., Civil No. 13-00141, United State District Court, District of Hawai# i. This "tolled the time for filing an individual 
wrongful foreclosure claim until September 29, 2021," Manuel , 152 
Hawai#i at 303–04, 526 P.3d at 280–81. The First Amended 
Complaint was filed while the statute of limitations was tolled. 
The circuit court concluded that class action tolling 
only applied to "identical causes of action asserted in the [Degamo] class action. If the claims are materially different 
from the [Degamo ] class action, . . . tolling does not apply." 
The court found that "Plaintiffs' request for rescissory damages [and] allegations related to loan servicing and posting notices on the properties after postponement of the original foreclosure sales . . . are materially different from the claims and theories of damages asserted in Degamo [.]" The court dismissed those 
claims as time-barred. 
The Degamo
 complaint was filed in Hawai#i state court 
on September 7, 2012. That "tolled the time for filing an individual wrongful foreclosure claim[.]" Manuel, 152 Hawai #i at 
303, 526 P.3d at 280. The 
Degamo complaint doesn't contain the 
words restitution , 
rescissory damages , loan servicing , or loan 
modification . It didn't have to. Hawai#i is a notice pleading 
jurisdiction where it is "not necessary to plead legal theories with precision." 
Reyes-Toledo , 143 Hawai#i at 259, 428 P.3d at 
771 (cleaned up). The 
Degamo complaint alleged wrongful 
7  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
foreclosure — that BANA (and its agents) conducted nonjudicial 
foreclosures without strictly complying with HRS § 667-5. BANA had "fair notice of what the plaintiff's claim is and the grounds upon which it rests." Id. Class action tolling applied to all 
factual bases and potential remedies applicable to a wrongful foreclosure claim. The circuit court erred by narrowly applying class action tolling only to factual and legal theories pleaded with precision. Id. 
C. Bui was not judicially estopped from pursuing
her wrongful foreclosure claim. 
Bui filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in 2010. Her 
schedule of assets included the property eventually foreclosed on 
by BANA. Her petition also included her statement of intention to surrender the property and to not claim it as exempt. A separate "Declaration of Debtor re: Surrender of Property" was filed. Bui received a discharge on June 21, 2010. 
The circuit court ruled that Bui was judicially 
estopped from pursuing her claim because she had surrendered her property in her bankruptcy proceeding. We review de novo. Ching v. Dung, 148 
Hawai#i 416, 426, 477 P.3d 856, 866 (2020). A party 
asserting judicial estoppel must show three things: (1) the other 
party's later position is inconsistent  with its earlier position;
(2) the other party persuaded  a court to accept its earlier 
position; and (3) the other party would derive an advantage  for 
itself or impose a detriment  on the opposing party if not 
estopped. Id. at 429, 477 P.3d at 869. 
(1) The Bankruptcy Code requires that the debtor file 
a statement of intent to retain or surrender encumbered property.  In re Ryan, 560 B.R. 339, 347 (Bankr. D. Haw. 2016), 
vacated on other grounds, BAP No. HI-16-1391-TaLB, 2018 WL 1938512 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. Jan. 4, 2018). 11 U.S.C. § 521(a)(2) states that "nothing in paragraphs (A) or (B) . . . shall alter 4
4 11 U.S.C.A. § 521(a)(2)(A) (2014). 
8  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the debtor's or the trustee's rights with regard to [the 
collateral] under this title." Id. The code does not define 
"surrender," nor does it say to whom the debtor must surrender the property, or what "surrender" requires the debtor to do. Id. 
In Ryan the Honorable Robert J. Faris, bankruptcy judge for the 
District of Hawai #i (in which Bui's bankruptcy was also filed), 
held: 
the debtor's stated intent to surrender merely means that
the debtor does not intend to reaffirm, redeem, or exemptthe property. . . . [S]ection 521(a)(2) is a noticeprovision that does not affect the respective rights of thedebtor and the secured creditor . . . . 
Id. at 349–50 (footnotes omitted) (citing Mayton v. Sears, 
Roebuck & Co. (In re Mayton) , 208 B.R. 61, 67-68 (9th Cir. BAP 
1997) ("[T]he only logical basis for reconciling the conflicting elements of [§ 521(a)(2)] is to hold that it is essentially a notice statute.") and 4 Collier on Bankruptcy  ¶ 521.14[4], at 
521–49 (16th ed. 2016) (§ 521(a)(2) "does not affect the debtor's substantive rights vis a vis the creditor[.]")). We agree with and adopt Judge Faris's reasoning. We conclude that Bui's "surrender" of her property in her bankruptcy case was not inconsistent with her later assertion of wrongful foreclosure.
(2) Bui's "surrender" of her property didn't 
"persuade" the bankruptcy court to do anything because her discharge "was entirely independent of the 'surrender' of the [p]roperty" as a matter of bankruptcy law. Ryan, 560 B.R. at 351. 
(3) Bui did not derive an advantage over, or impose a 
detriment on, BANA by complying with the Bankruptcy Code. BANA obtained relief from the automatic bankruptcy stay on April 21, 2010. The mortgagee's affidavit of foreclosure under power of sale was recorded on June 17, 2010, four days before Bui received a discharge. Bui is not challenging BANA's right to foreclose; 
she claims that BANA didn't comply with HRS § 667-5 when it did. 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Bui's wrongful foreclosure claim was not barred by 
judicial estoppel. The circuit court erred by dismissing the 
claim on that basis. 
D. Bui's quiet title and ejectment claims
against Bush and Bennett were time-barred,but her quiet title claim against Quicken
Loans was not . 
Bui alleged claims for quiet title and ejectment 
against defendants Matthew Robert Bush, Heather Noel Bennett, and 
Quicken Loans , Inc. Bui's foreclosed property was conveyed to 
Bush and Bennett on January 4, 2011. The deed was recorded on 
February 4, 2011. Bui joined the action below on May 3, 2019. The circuit court concluded that Bui's claims to quiet title and for ejectment were time-barred by a six-year statute of limitations. The court did not specify the authority on which it relied; we assume it was HRS § 657-1(4) (2016), which applies to "[p]ersonal actions of any nature whatsoever not specifically covered by the laws of the State." 
At first we note that Bush and Bennett's mortgage to 
Quicken Loans was dated December 29, 2017, and recorded on January 8, 2018. Even if a six-year statute of limitations applied, Bui's quiet title claim against Quicken Loans was timely and the circuit court erred by dismissing that claim based on the statute of limitations. Bui didn't assert an ejectment claim against Quicken Loans because she did not allege that Quicken Loans had possession of the foreclosed property. 
The First Amended Complaint doesn't allege that Bush 
and Bennett's deed was forged or had been procured by fraud in the factum.
5 Thus, the deed is at most voidable, not void. See 
Delapinia , 150 Hawai #i at 104, 497 P.3d at 119 ("sales pursuant 
to a wrongful foreclosure are voidable, regardless of whether the violation was statutory or contractual, substantial or a mere 
5 Bui would have had to allege "the circumstances constituting
fraud" with particularity. HRCP Rule 9(b). 
10 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
irregularity"). HRS § 657-1(4)'s six-year statute of limitations 
applies to a claim that a deed is voidable because the foreclosure from which it resulted was wrongful. Cf. Hancock v. 
Kulana Partners, LLC, 145 Hawai #i 374, 382, 452 P.3d 371, 379 
(2019) (holding that HRS § 657-1(4) applies to claim that deed was voidable). 
Bui argues, "Count III [(her quiet title claim)] is not 
a claim to void an instrument to which Bui was a party, or a claim for compensation for deprivation of title, but a claim to 
declare title  in Bui" and "there is no limitations period  for a 
quiet title claim[.]" Bui's argument exalts form over substance. HRS Chapter 669 governs quieting title. HRS § 669-1(a) (2016) allows actions "brought by any person against another person who claims, or who may claim adversely to the plaintiff, an estate or interest in real property, for the purpose of determining the adverse claim." HRS Chapter 669 prescribes a remedy; it does not have its own statute of limitations. But there must be a legal basis to invoke the remedy of determining competing title claims. Here, Bui claims superior title because Bush and Bennett's deed is voidable, having resulted from a wrongful foreclosure. That claim is subject to HRS § 657-1(4)'s six-year statute of limitations. Bush and Bennett's deed was recorded over six years before Bui joined the action below. The circuit court was not wrong to conclude that Bui's quiet title and ejectment claims against Bush and Bennett were time-barred. 
E. We lack jurisdiction over the appeals from
the circuit court's order of severance. 
Panuelos, the Hillingers, and Bui contend the circuit 
court erred by granting BANA's motion to sever. BANA has not 
raised the issue of jurisdiction, but "if the parties do not raise the issue of a lack of subject matter jurisdiction, a court sua sponte  will." Kapuwai v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu
, 121 
Hawai#i 33, 40, 211 P.3d 750, 757 (2009) (brackets omitted). 
11 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"[W]hen judgment is entered under [HRCP] Rule 54(b), a 
timely notice of appeal brings up for review all interlocutory 
decisions and orders implicated by the judgment ." Anastasi v. 
Fid. Nat'l Title Ins. Co., 134 Hawai #i 400, 414, 341 P.3d 1200, 
1214 (App. 2014) (italics added) (underscoring omitted) (quoting 10 Moore's Fed. Prac.  § 54.28[3][c] (3d ed. 2009)), vacated in 
part on other grounds , 137 Hawai #i 104, 366 P.3d 160 (2016). The 
circuit court's August 11, 2020 Order dismissed "[a]ll claims asserted by" Panuelos, the Hillingers, and Bui. It severed " the 
remaining Plaintiffs' cases  from this action into separate 
actions by property" and directed the court clerk to "open new cases with separate case numbers corresponding to the relevant parties[.]" (Italics added.) 
On remand Panuelos, the 
Hillingers, and Bui will be parties to one case, 2CC191000153. Severance of the other plaintiffs' cases wasn't implicated by the HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified judgments on appeal. We lack jurisdiction to review the propriety of the circuit court's severance of the other plaintiffs' cases. 
IV. DISPOSITION 
The HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified judgments for BANA and 
against Panuelos, the Hillingers, and Bui, entered on August 26, 2020, are vacated. The circuit court's August 11, 2020 Order is: (1) vacated to the extent it dismissed (a) Panuelos', the Hillingers', and Bui's claims for damages (including restitution or rescissory damages), and (b) Bui's quiet title claim against Quicken Loans; but (2) affirmed to the extent it dismissed Bui's quiet title and ejectment claims against Bush and Bennett. No other parts of the Order are before us on these appeals.
