Upon consideration of the "Stipulation for Dismissal 
with Prejudice of Appeal of Barbara J.K. Duarte[,]" filed 
March 20, 2023, by Defendant-Appellee Bank of America, N.A., the papers in support, and the record, it appears that (1) the appeal has been docketed; (2) pursuant to 
Hawai# i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure Rule 42(b), the parties stipulate to dismiss the appeal of Barbara J.K. Duarte docketed as CAAP-20-0000579 (consolidated 
under CAAP-20-0000576) and bear their own attorneys' fees and 
costs in that appeal; and (3) the stipulation is dated and signed by counsel for all parties appearing in the consolidated appeals. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the stipulation to 
dismiss the appeal is approved, and the appeal docketed as CAAP
-
20-0000579 is dismissed. The parties to that appeal shall bear their own attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with that appeal. This order does not affect the appeal of any appellant in these consolidated appeals other than Duarte.
