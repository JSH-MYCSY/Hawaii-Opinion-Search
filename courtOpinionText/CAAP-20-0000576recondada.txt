APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 2CC191000153) 
ORDER 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and Guidry, JJ.) 
Jacqueline Bui
 seeks reconsideration of part III.D of 
our September 24, 2024 Memorandum Opinion, in which we held that 
her quiet title and ejectment claims against Matthew Robert Bush 
and Heather Noel Bennett (who bought Bui's foreclosed property 
from Bank of America, N.A. ( BANA) after BANA sold the property to 
itself in a nonjudicial foreclosure) were time-barred under Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 657-1(4), Delapinia v. Nationstar 
Mortgage LLC, 150 
Hawai#i 91, 104, 497 P.3d 106, 119 (2021) 
(Delapinia II ) ("sales pursuant to a wrongful foreclosure are 
voidable, regardless of whether the violation was statutory or contractual, substantial or a mere irregularity"), and Hancock v. Kulana Partners, LLC, 145 Hawai #i 374, 382, 452 P.3d 371, 379 
(2019) (holding that HRS § 657-1(4) applies to claim that deed was voidable). 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Bui's only argument warranting consideration under 
Hawai#i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 40(b) is that we should 
not have applied Delapinia II  retroactively. In Delapinia II , 
the supreme court held "that wrongful foreclosures in violation 
of the power of sale are voidable, and to the extent Silva[ v. Lopez, 5 Haw. 262 (Haw. Kingdom 1884)] is to the contrary, it is 
overruled." 150 Hawai #i at 93, 497 P.3d at 108. Bui contends 
that Silva  was good law when she filed her amended complaint in 
2019, and there is no statute of limitations to challenge a void foreclosure. 
BANA and Bush and Bennett counter that Delapinia II 
didn't create a new rule of law — it clarified "that a wrongful foreclosure that violates the power of sale is voidable, not void." Id. at 101, 497 P.3d at 116. We stated as much in Delapinia v. Nationstar Mortgage LLC , 146 Hawai #i 218, 229, 458 
P.3d 929, 940 (App. 2020), aff'd in part, vacated in part , 150 
Hawai#i 91, 497 P.3d 106 (2021): 
While it is true that the supreme court has not expressly
overruled Silva , the supreme court has more recently held
that improper foreclosure sales are voidable. 
. . . . 
In light of the supreme court's more recent holdings,
we decline to adopt the Delapinias' reliance on Silva  and 
Lee[ v. HSBC Bank USA , 121 Hawai# i 287, 218 P.3d 775
(2009)]. 
We conclude that improper foreclosure sales are
voidable, rather than void, and that the supreme court has
either distinguished or impliedly overruled its earlierdecisions holding to the contrary. 
Id. at 229, 458 P.3d at 940. 
Of this, the supreme court stated: "to the extent the 
ICA concluded that Silva  has been impliedly overruled, it erred. 
. . . That said, Silva is inconsonant with the direction of our 
recent precedent, and we clarify today that a wrongful foreclosure that violates the power of sale is voidable, not void." Delapinia II
, 150 Hawai#i at 101, 497 P.3d at 116. 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Whether or not Delapinia II created new law, judicial 
decisions are assumed to apply retroactively. League of Women 
Voters of Honolulu v. State, 150 Hawai #i 182, 207, 499 P.3d 382, 
407 (2021); State v. Ikezawa, 75 Haw. 210, 220, 857 P.2d 593, 597 
(1993). 
As for the retroactive effect of new law, the supreme 
court has stated: 
We recognize that we announce a new rule in this case,
and that we are free to apply this new rule with or without
retroactivity. This court has generally considered threeprimary alternatives in deciding to what degree a new ruleis to have retroactive effect. First, this court may give anew rule purely prospective effect, which means that therule is applied neither to the parties in the law-makingdecision nor to those others against or by whom it might beapplied to conduct or events occurring before that decision.Second, this court may give a new rule limited or pipelineretroactive effect, under which the rule applies to theparties in the decision and all cases that are on directreview or not yet final as of the date of the decision.Third, this court may give a new rule full retroactiveeffect, under which the rule applies both to the partiesbefore the court and to all others by and against whomclaims may be pressed. . . . 
In exercising our discretion in deciding the effect of
a new rule, we weigh the merits and demerits of retroactiveapplication of the particular rule in light of (a) thepurpose of the newly announced rule, (b) the extent ofreliance . . . on the old standards, and (c) the effect onthe administration of justice of a retroactive applicationof the new standards. 
Lewi v. State, 145 Hawai #i 333, 349 n.21, 452 P.3d 330, 346 n.21 
(2019) (cleaned up). 
When the supreme court intended to limit new law's 
retroactive effect, it has said so and explained why. See, e.g., 
Wilmington Sav. Fund Soc'y, FSB v. Domingo, 155 Hawai#i 1, 16, 
556 P.3d 347, 362 (2024) (giving limited retroactive effect to partial overruling of Bank of Am., N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 143 Hawai#i 249, 428 P.3d 761 (2018)). The Delapinia II opinion did 
not give its overruling of Silva purely prospective or limited retroactive effect. We must, and did, apply it to Bui's claims against Bush and Bennett for quiet title and ejectment.
