SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: 
Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
Self-represented Plaintiff-Appellant Michael C. 
Greenspon appeals from the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit's 
(1) August 28, 2020 Final Judgment, (2) September 22, 2020 Order  
denying his motion to set aside the orders dismissing the action and declaring Greenspon a vexatious litigant, and (3) "all prior

orders and oral rulings . . . and all findings and conclusions 
there in [sic]."1 
Briefly, in 2003, Greenspon obtained a $650,000.00 
mortgage loan for a property in Ha‘ ikū, Maui (the Ha‘ikū 
Property
). In 2006, Greenspon modified the loan, increasing the 
principal amount to $800,000.00. In 2008, Greenspon was sent a 
notice stating that his loan was "in serious default" and that 
he must pay $
27,664.44 on or before December 6, 2008 to cure the 
default. In 2010, the Ha‘ ikū Prop erty was sold at a public non-
judicial foreclosure auction to Deutsche Bank National Trust 
Company, as Trustee. 
Much litigation ensued based on this foreclosure.  In 
the case underlying this appeal, Greenspon filed a complaint 
against Deutsche Bank
 National Trust Company and Ocwen Loan 
Servicing LLC in March 2019. Later that year, Greenspon filed a 
First Amended Complaint adding James Blaine Rogers III; 
J. Blaine Rogers III, ALC; and Dentons US LLP as defendants 
(collectively Dentons Defendants).  Greenspon also named 32

attorney Alan Jarren Ma with Watanabe Ing, LLP as a defendant in 
his First Amended Complaint. 
In the First Amended Complaint, Greenspon asserted 
fourteen counts against the defendants. Greenspon settled with 
Deutsche Bank, Ocwen, and Watanabe Ing LLP and their attorneys 
(including Ma), leaving only the Dentons Defendants.4 The 
Dentons Defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings asserting inter alia that claims against them were barred by litigation privilege relying in part on Hungate v. Law Off. of David B. 
Rosen, 139 Hawai‘ i 394, 413, 391 P.3d 1, 20 (2017) (abrogated on 
other grounds by State ex. rel. Shikada v. Bristol-Meyers Squibb 
Co., 152 Hawai‘ i 418, 526 P.3d 395 (2023)). 
The circuit court entered: (1) judgment on the 
pleadings against Greenspon because the claims against counsel 
were barred by litigation privilege; (2) findings, conclusions, 
and order granting the Dentons Defendants' motion to designate 
Greenspon a vexatious litigant under Hawai‘i Revised Statutes 
(HRS) chapter 634J; and (3) Final Judgment. Greenspon filed a 
timely notice of appeal. 
4 The claims against the Dentons Defendants in the First Amended 
Complaint were as follows: Fraud/Intentional Misrepresentation (Count 1 ); 
UDAP (Counts 3- 5); Gross Negligence/Recklessness (Count 7); Breach of 
Fiduciary Duty (Count 8); Tortious Interference (Count 9); Intentional 
Infliction of Emotional Distress (County 10), Damages (Count 11); 
Punitive/Exemplary Damages (Count 12); and Injunctive Relief (Count 14). 
Greenspon asserted Conversion/Slander of Title/Quantum Meruit (Count 6) 
against Rogers.

On appeal, Greenspon raises five points of error  
challenging the dismissal of his case (Points A-C), the 
designation of vexatious litigant (Point D), and the 
impartiality of the circuit court (Point E).  5 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve this 
appeal as discussed below, and vacate and remand. 
(1) First, Greenspon challenges the dismissal of his 
case (Points A-C). In particular, Greenspon contends his first amended complaint plainly asserts violation of HRS § 480-2 
(2008) and "common law tort claims." 
The gist of Greenspon's 
argument appears to be that the Dentons Defendants acted as debt 
5 Greenspon's five points of error are as follows: 
A. "The circuit court reversibly erred as a matter of law by dismissing 
Appellant's FAC § V UDAP claims based on Appellees patently illegal 
unfair and deceptive conduct"; 
B. "The circuit court reversibly erred as a matter of law by dismissing 
Appellant's FAC § III & IV UDAP claims based on Appellees' illegal 
conduct as debt collectors in violation of 15 USC § 1692 (FDCPA ) and 
HRS § 480D"; 
C. "The circuit court reversibly erred as a matter of law by dismissing all of Appellant' s FAC common law tort claims on the pleadings"; 
D. "The circuit court reversibly erred as a matter of law and grossly 
abused its discretion by granting Appellee's HRS § 634J motion"; and 
E. "The circuit court's conduct and systematic errors shows a pattern 
of bias[.]" 
(Some emphasis omitted.) 
4   
 
  
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
collectors, not attorneys. The Dentons Defendants again assert 
litigation privilege. 
Generally, litigation privilege bars claims by a civil 
litigant against the opposing party's counsel. Kahala Royal
Corp. v. Goodsill Anderson Quinn & Stifel
, 113 Hawai‘i 251, 269, 
151 P.3d 732, 750 (2007). 
In ruling on the Dentons Defendants' motion for 
judgment on the pleadings, the circuit court referred to the 
reasons stated during the June 24, 2020 hearing. 
In that 
hearing, the circuit court found that the Dentons Defendants' actions arose from the practice of law: 
The Supreme Court did and does allow UDAP claims 
against attorneys. They are not granted blanket immunity 
or insulated from such claims. However, the claims must 
arise against an attorney in a business context and not in 
a practice of law context, and in that regard, the 
allegations and reviewing all of the materials submitted in this case and the Court taking judicial notice of all of 
the other cases in which issues similar to this have been 
raised by Mr. Greenspon, notes that the actions of 
Mr. Rogers, his firm, and other attorneys in his firm arise 
out of the actual practice of law and not in the business 
relationship, and, therefore, the motion is granted. 
(Emphasis added.) 
The First Amended Complaint supports the circuit 
court's finding. Although, in his First Amended Complaint, 
Greenspon framed the Dentons Defendants' actions as that of 
"debt collectors," he acknowledged that they represented 
Deutsche Bank and Ocwen. 
5   
 
  
  
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRS § 480-2(a) or UDAP provides that "[u]nfair methods 
of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the 
conduct of any trade or commerce are unlawful." In Hungate, the 
Hawai‘i Supreme Court declined to recognize a UDAP claim against 
the lender's attorney. Hungate, 139 Hawai‘ i at 405, 413, 391 
P.3d at 12, 20. 
Because Greenspon acknowledged that the Dentons 
Defendants represented Deutsche Bank and Ocwen, and the circuit 
court found that the UDAP claims arose out of that 
representation, the circuit court did not err in dismissing the 
UDAP claims against the Dentons Defendants. See In re Off. of
Info. Pracs. Op. Letter No. F16-01, 147 Hawai‘ i 286, 294, 465 
P.3d 733, 741 (2020) (explaining order granting motion for 
judgment on the pleadings is reviewed de novo). 
As to Greenspon's "common law tort claims," he argues 
in his opening brief that dismissal of the fraud and wrongful 
foreclosure claims were wrong.6 In Domingo v. James B. Nutter & 
Co.
, 153 Hawai‘i 584, 616, 543 P.3d 1, 33 (App. 2023), this court 
held that a wrongful foreclosure claim against the lender's 
attorney per se should not be permitted. Thus, the circuit 
court here did not err in dismissing Greenspon's wrongful foreclosure claim. 
6 Greenspon also seems to argue his abuse of process claim was wrongly 
dismissed, but it appears that any abuse of process argument was raised in 
the context of his UDAP claim and not as a separate count in his First 
Amended Complaint. 
6   
 
  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
However, "an attorney is not immune from liability or 
civil damages based upon the attorney's own fraud upon the court 
in prior litigation proceedings." Id. at 609, 543 P.3d at 26. 
In his fraud claim, Greenspon maintained among other things that the defendants filed fraudulent documents and made false 
representations to the court. When considering the allegations 
in the complaint, and deeming them true as we must, the circuit 
court erred in dismissing Greenspon's fraud claim to the extent it alleged fraud on the court. See id. at 599-600, 543 P.3d at 
16-17 (explaining we must deem the allegation in the complaint as true). 
(2) Next, Greenspon challenges his designation as a 
vexatious litigant (Point D). 
We review a vexatious litigant determination under the 
abuse of discretion standard. Trs. of Est. of Bishop v. Au
, 146 
Hawaiʻi 272, 278, 463 P.3d 929, 935 (2020). 
A vexatious litigant includes a plaintiff who, "[i]n 
any litigation while acting in propria persona, files, in bad faith, unmeritorious motions, pleadings, or other papers, conducts unnecessary discovery, or engages in other tactics that 
are frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay[.]" 
HRS § 634J-1(3) (2016). 
A vexatious litigant also includes a 
7   
 
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
plaintiff who "[h]as previously been declared to be a vexatious 
litigant by any state or federal court of record in any action 
or proceeding based upon the same or substantially similar 
facts, transaction, or occurrence." HRS § 634J-1(4) (2016). 
In its order designating Greenspon a vexatious 
litigant, the circuit court took judicial notice of the 
pleadings and documents filed in Case No. 2015-CA-004488-O, 
administratively consolidated with Case No. 2015-CA-004489-O through 4593, In Re: Butler & Hosch, P.A., Assignor, To: Michel 
Moecker, Assignee, in the Circuit Court Ninth Judicial Circuit, 
Orange County, Florida Complex Business Jurisdiction (Florida 
Case). The circuit court considered the findings in the Florida 
Case, including that Greenspon failed to comply with orders, 
conducted himself in a manner that was "frivolous, burdensome 
and harassing"; engaged in "meritless and vexatious litigation"; 
and delivered "an unmarked envelope containing $500 cash" to the 
Florida court. "The Florida Court invoked its 'inherent authority to prohibit court filings by vexatious pro se 
litigants.'" 
The circuit court also found that Greenspon disrupted 
the orderly proceedings of Hawai‘i courts. The circuit court 
recounted five instances where envelopes of cash were submitted 
8   
 
  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
with Greenspon's filings. The circuit court also made findings 
regarding Greenspon failing to comply with court orders, causing 
unnecessary delay in providing materials, and conducting 
unnecessary discovery. Although Greenspon "challenges all of 
the erroneous FOF," he does not show the findings were clearly 
erroneous. 
In sum, the circuit court's findings show Greenspon 
conducted "unnecessary discovery" and caused "unnecessary delay" satisfying HRS § 634J-1(3). 
The circuit court's findings also 
satisfy HRS § 634J-1(4) as the Florida court considered Greenspon's actions vexatious, including failure to comply with 
court orders and submitting cash to the court, which similarly 
occurred in 
Hawai‘i. 
Thus, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion 
in designating Greenspon a vexatious litigant. 
(3) Finally, Greenspon maintains the circuit court 
was biased (Point E). 
Greenspon argues the circuit court 
"breached its [ Hawai‘i Revised Code of Judicial Conduct (HRCJC)] 
duties to uphold and apply the law, to actually decide matters 
on the merits, and to make reasonable accommodations to allow 
the pro se Appellant to be heard, and in fact the court has not 
held any hearings in this case at all." 
9   
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The argument section of Greenspon's opening brief does 
not reference any specific section of HRCJC in violation of 
Hawai‘i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(7), and may be 
deemed waived. 
Nonetheless, as Greenspon specifically challenges the 
circuit court's bias, we look at HRCJC Rule 2.3, which provides 
in pertinent part that "[a] judge shall perform the duties of 
judicial office without bias or prejudice" and "[a] judge shall 
not . . . engage in harassment[.]" 
HRCJC Rule 2.3(a), (b). 
Some examples of bias are using "epithets; slurs; demeaning nicknames[,]" while harassment "is verbal or physical conduct 
that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward a person on bases such as race, sex, gender, religion, national origin, 
ethnicity, disability, age, sexual orientation, marital status, 
socioeconomic status, political affiliation, or personal 
characteristics." HRCJC Rule 2.3 cmt. (emphasis omitted). 
Greenspon complains that the court "failed to 
adjudicate" his claims and "grossly abused its discretion." 
(Emphases omitted.) Greenspon's complaints do not show bias or harassment as contemplated by HRCJC Rule 2.3. 
Based on the foregoing, we vacate the circuit court's 
August 28, 2020 Final Judgment and September 22, 2020 Order 
denying his motion to set aside the orders dismissing the action 
and declaring Greenspon a vexatious litigant to the extent the 
10   
 
   
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
First Amended Complaint alleged fraud on the court. We affirm 
in all other respects, and remand this case to the circuit court 
for further proceedings consistent with this summary disposition 
order.
