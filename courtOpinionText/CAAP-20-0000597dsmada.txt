NO. CAAP-20-0000597 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
HARVEY HAKODA, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
RUSSELL D. YANG, M.D., Defendant-Appellee, and
DOE DEFENDANTS 1-10, Defendants 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 1CC181001450) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Chan and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears we lack appellate 
jurisdiction over self-represented Plaintiff-Appellant Harvey 
Hakoda's (
Hakoda) appeal from the circuit court's September 23, 
2020 oral order (Order) granting an August 27, 2020 "Motion to 
Withdraw as Counsel for [Hakoda] by Law Offices of Ian L. Mattoch 
and The Markam Group., Inc., P.S.," in Civil No. 1CC181001450. 
The Order is not appealable, regardless of its 
contents, because an "oral decision is not an appealable order." 
KNG Corp. v. Kim, 107 Hawai# i 73, 77, 110 P.3d 397, 401 (2005); 
see Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 4(a)(1) 
("[T]he notice of appeal shall be filed within 30 days after entry of the judgment or appealable order."); HRAP Rule 4(a)(5) 
("A judgment or order is entered when it is filed in the office 
of the clerk of the court."). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Even if the Order was written, it would not be 
appealable because it is interlocutory and does not fall within 
an exception to the final judgment requirement. The circuit 
court has not entered an appealable, final judgment in this case. 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (2016) authorizes 
appeals from "final judgments, orders, or decrees[.]" Appeals 
under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by 
the rules of the court." HRS § 641-1(c) (2016). Hawai# i Rules 
of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment 
shall be set forth on a separate document." The Supreme Court of 
Hawai# i has held that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after 
the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties 
pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming 
& Wright, 76 Hawai# i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). Here, 
the circuit court has not entered a final judgment and, therefore, the Order is interlocutory. 
The Order, even if reduced to writing, also would not 
fall under an exception to the final judgment requirement set 
forth in 
Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848), the collateral 
order doctrine, or HRS § 641-1(b). See Ciesla v. Reddish
, 78 
Hawai# i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) (requirements for 
appealability under the 
Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, 
Schutte, Fleming & Wright
, 88 Hawai# i 319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 
(1998) (requirements for appealability under the collateral order doctrine); HRS § 641-1(b) (2016) (requirements for an appeal from 
an interlocutory order). 
See also Chuck v. St. Paul Fire and 
Marine Ins. Co.
, 61 Haw. 552, 606 P.2d 1320 (1980) (declining to 
extend the collateral order doctrine to allow immediate appeal 
from an order granting disqualification of counsel); Gomes v. 
Heirs of Kauwe, 52 Haw. 126, 472 P.2d 119 (1970) (holding that 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
orders denying disqualification of counsel are interlocutory and 
not appealable under the collateral order rule). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, October 14, 2020.
