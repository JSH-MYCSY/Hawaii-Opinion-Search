APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1CC181001959) 
  
ORDER OF CORRECTION 
(By: McCullen, J.) 
IT IS ORDERED that the Opinion entered on January 29, 
2025 (docket no. 153) in the above case is corrected as follows: 
  On page 5, second full paragraph, line 4, change the 
comma (,) to a semicolon (;) so that the beginning of line 4 is corrected to read, "facilities; and (5) roof overhang."  
 
 
   
  
  
 
 
 
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On page 13, subsection (b), Resorttrust is misspelled. 
Subsection (b) should be corrected to read, "Board's and 
Resorttrust's Motions for Summary Judgment". 
On page 18, first full paragraph, line 1, partial is 
misspelled. The sentence should be corrected to read, "The 
circuit court denied Frankel's motion for partial summary 
judgment reasoning that the public trust doctrine did not apply 
to Lot 41 and even if it did, whether an agency violated the public trust doctrine was fact-based:". 
On page 22, first full paragraph, last line, a single 
quotation mark needs to be inserted so as corrected, the last 
line reads, "public.'" Id. at 177, 449 P.3d at 1175." 
On page 44, first full block quotation, the single 
quotation marks need to be replaced with quotation marks and 
quotation marks need to be inserted before "would" and at the 
end of the sentence, so as corrected, the block quote should 
read, 
If the agency knew that it could always " supplement" or 
"create" the administrative record in the reviewing court, 
then the agency " would have little incentive to prepare an 
adequate and reviewable administrative record, despite the 
clear mandate of [the National Environmental Policy Act 
(NEPA)] and HEPA that the agency prepare the required 
record before deciding upon a particular course of 
conduct." 
On page 45, lines 18 and 23, the pin cite for 449 P.3d 
should be 1177 not 1777, the corrected case cites should read, 
"See Ching
, 145 Hawaiʻi at 152, 179, 180, 449 P.3d at 1150, 1177, 
2

1178." and "See id., at 152, 179, 180, 449 P.3d at 1150, 1177, 
1178;". 
On page 47, first full paragraph, line 2, the hyphen 
should be removed from "decision-making" so as corrected, the 
sentence should read, "Finally, an agency does not get a do-over 
of its decisionmaking process on appellate review or in a 
declaratory action." 
On page 55, first line, volume number 167 should be 
replaced with volume number 9 so as corrected, the case cite 
should read, "Waiāhole I, 94 Hawaiʻ i at 142, 158, 9 P.3d at 454, 
470;". 
The Clerk of the Court is directed to take all 
necessary steps to notify the publishing agencies of this 
change. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawaiʻ i, March 5, 2025.
