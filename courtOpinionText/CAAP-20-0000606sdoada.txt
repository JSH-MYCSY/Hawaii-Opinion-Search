(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Maxwell Benjamin Werblun (
Werblun) 
appeals from the District Court of the Second Circuit, Wailuku 
Division's (district court) August 12, 2020 Judgment and Notice 
of Entry of Judgment,1 convicting him of Excessive Speeding, in

Werblun contends Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai# i 
(State) did not lay sufficient foundation to introduce the speed-reading because the record is silent as to the manufacturer's 
training requirements to operate the LTI 2020 TruSpeed speed-

2  HRS ยง 291C-105(a)(1), (2) provides:  "(a) No person shall drive a 
motor vehicle at a speed exceeding:  (1) The applicable state or county speed
limit by thirty miles per hour or more; or (2) Eighty miles per hour or moreirrespective of the applicable state or county speed limit." NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
reading device (Device), and the State failed to demonstrate the 
citing officer, Ryan Elers (Officer Elers) met the manufacturer's training requirements; therefore, the district court abused its 
discretion by admitting the "testimony as to the radar speed-reading," and without the speed-reading, no substantial evidence supports the conviction. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve the parties' arguments as follows, and affirm. 
As to whether the State laid a proper foundation, we 
review the district court's determination for an abuse of discretion, State v. Assaye, 121 
Hawai# i 204, 210, 216 P.3d 1227, 
1233 (2009), and we will not disturb it unless the district court clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant.  State v. Crisostomo, 94 Hawai# i 282, 287, 12 
P.3d 873, 878 (2000).  To lay foundation for a speed-reading, the State must demonstrate that (1) the accuracy of the device was tested according to procedures recommended by the manufacturer, and (2) "the nature and extent of an officer's training in the operation" of the device met "the requirements indicated by the manufacturer" (Training Prong).  Assaye, 121 Hawai# i at 213, 215, 
216 P.3d at 1236, 1238.  To satisfy the Training Prong, the State "must establish both (1) the [training] requirements indicated by the manufacturer, and (2) the training actually received by the

operator."  State v. Gonzalez, 128 Hawai# i 314, 327, 288 P.3d 
788, 801 (2012). 
Here, Officer Elers testified: he was trained to use 
the Device several times, most recently in 2019 by Roosevelt 
Rogers (
Rogers), an employee of the manufacturer, LTI; the 
training was 32 hours and consisted of classroom instruction, testing, field instruction, and learning to operate the Device; Rogers provided LTI's user manual for the Device, which Officer Elers used during the training; the training met LTI's requirements to test and operate the Device, and it conformed to the manual; upon completion of training, Rogers certified Officer Elers as proficient in testing and operating the Device; his certification was valid the day he cited Werblun; and the training also consisted of learning the four procedures to test the Device to determine whether it is working properly, as well as LTI's recommendations for how often to test the Device and how to operate it to ascertain a vehicle's speed, all of which Officer Elers described. 
Officer Elers's testimony establishes that "the 
training course itself was approved by the manufacturer [and] was consistent with the manufacturer's requirements," and Officer Elers's description of the course, including the testing and operating procedures he learned, was sufficient to establish "the type of training the manufacturer recommended."  Cf. State v. Amiral, 132 
Hawai# i 170, 178-79, 319 P.3d 1178, 1186-87 (2014). 
Moreover, the record indicated he was instructed by the manufacturer itself, which certified him to operate and test the device upon completion of training.  See, e.g., State v.

Portillo, 146 Hawai i # 238, 461 P.3d 29, No. CAAP-18-0000949, 2020 
WL 1879621, at *1 (App. Apr. 15, 2020) (SDO); State v. Rezentes, 
139 Hawai# i 263, 388 P.3d 51, No. CAAP-15-0000294, 2016 WL 
6330390, at *1 (App. Oct. 28, 2016) (SDO). 
Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its 
discretion in determining that the State laid proper foundation for the speed-reading.  THEREFORE, we affirm the district court's August 12, 2020 Judgment and Notice of Entry of Judgment. 
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, June 17, 2022.
