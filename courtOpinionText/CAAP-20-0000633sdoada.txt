STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
CHRISTIAN CONCEPCION, also known as
Christian Ernie Concepcion, Defendant-Appellee,
and 
SCOTTS BAIL BONDS L.L.C., dba Aloha Bail Bonds,
Real Party in Interest-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1CPC-20-0000743) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, and Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Appellant Scott's Bail Bonds, L.L.C., dba Aloha Bail 
Bonds (
SBB
), appeals from the September 22, 2020 "Findings of 
Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying Scott's Bail Bonds' 
Motion to Set Aside Bond Forfeiture," entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court).
1/ 
On appeal, SBB contends that the Circuit Court 
(1) erred by denying SBB's September 10, 2020 "Motion to Set Aside Bond Forfeiture" (Motion) on the basis that the court 
lacked jurisdiction over the Motion, and (2) should have 
considered reasons for good cause as to why execution of the July 14, 2020 "Judgment and Order of Forfeiture of Bail Bond" (Forfeiture Judgment) should not have issued. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
1/    The Honorable Shirley M. Kawamura presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we 
resolve SBB's contentions as follows and affirm: 
The procedure for forfeiture of bail bonds is set out 
in Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 804-51 (2014), which provides 
in relevant part: 
Whenever the court, in any criminal cause, forfeits any bond
or recognizance given in a criminal cause, the court shallimmediately enter up judgment in favor of the State andagainst the principal or principals and surety or suretieson the bond, jointly and severally, for the full amount ofthe penalty thereof, and shall cause execution to issuethereon immediately after the expiration of thirty days fromthe date that notice is given via personal service orcertified mail, return receipt requested, to the surety orsureties on the bond, of the entry of the judgment in favorof the State, unless before the expiration of thirty daysfrom the date that notice is given to the surety or suretieson the bond of the entry of the judgment in favor of theState, a motion or application of the principal orprincipals, surety or sureties, or any of them, showing goodcause why execution should not issue upon the judgment, isfiled with the court.  If the motion or application, after ahearing held thereon, is sustained, the court shall vacatethe judgment of forfeiture and, if the principal surrendersor is surrendered pursuant to section 804-14 or section804-41, return the bond or recognizance to the principal orsurety, whoever shall have given it, less the amount of anycost, as established at the hearing, incurred by the Stateas a result of the nonappearance of the principal or otherevent on the basis of which the court forfeited the bond or recognizance.  If the motion or application, after a hearingheld thereon, is overruled, execution shall forthwith issueand shall not be stayed unless the order overruling themotion or application is appealed from as in the case of afinal judgment. 
(Emphasis added.) 
 As the Supreme Court of Hawai# i has "reiterate[d], 
once a bond is forfeited pursuant to HRS § 804-51, a surety has 
thirty days from the time it receives notice of forfeiture to set
 
aside the forfeiture judgment[.]"  State v. Vaimili, 131 Hawai# i 
9, 15, 313 P.3d 698, 704 (2013).  "HRS § 804-51 permits the filing neither of a second motion . . . nor any
 motion after the 
closing of the thirty-day window."  State v. Ranger Ins. Co., 83 Hawai# i 118, 124 n.5, 925 P.2d 288, 294 n.5 (1996) ("Without 
addressing its merits, the motion to vacate [forfeiture judgment]did 'not provide a legal basis for the relief requested,' as the circuit court ruled, because it was not filed within the time limit imposed by HRS § 804-51, and the circuit court was therefore without power to consider it.")  
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Here, SBB acknowledges that it received notice of the 
Forfeiture Judgment on August 7, 2020, and does not dispute that 
it electronically filed the Motion on September 10, 2020, more than thirty days after receiving notice.  But SBB argues that the Motion should nonetheless be deemed timely because counsel "tendered" the Motion to the Circuit Court on September 3, 2020 — within the thirty-day period — by emailing a draft of the Motion to the court chambers to obtain a hearing date.  In this regard, the Circuit Court made the following findings of fact, which SBB does not expressly challenge:
2/ 
7. On September 3, 2020 at 5:56 p.m., [SBB's
counsel] emailed to the Court via the 12th Division email
address a draft copy of the present Motion requesting thatthe Court calendar the Motion. 
8. On September 4, 2020 at 10:31 a.m., the 12th
Division replied to [SBB's counsel], setting the hearing onthe Motion for September 21, 2020 at 10:30 a.m. andrequesting that he file the Motion[] accordingly.[
3/] 
9. On September 10, 2020, at 11:55 a.m. [SBB's
counsel] filed the Motion to Set Aside Bond Forfeiture. 
(Footnote added.) 
While SBB claims it "tendered" the Motion within the 
required thirty-day period when it emailed a copy to the Circuit 
Court and requested a hearing date, such a tendering does not satisfy HRS § 804-51's requirement that the Motion be filed within the thirty-day window.  
The Hawai# i Electronic Filing and Service Rules (HEFSR) 
require every attorney representing a party to a case maintained in the Judiciary Information Management System (J
IMS) to 
(1) register as a Judiciary Electronic Filing System (JEFS
) user, 
and (2) electronically file each document as an Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) document through JEFS.  HEFSR Rules 1, 2.2, 4.1(a).  "Electronic filing means (1) the submission of documents 
2/    Unchallenged factual findings are deemed binding on appeal.  Okada 
Trucking Co. v. Bd. of Water Supply, 97 Hawai #i 450, 459, 40 P.3d 73, 82 
(2002). 
3/    SBB claims on appeal that it "received" the Circuit Court's
September 4, 2020 email on September 10, 2020, but it does not provide any
discernible record citation to support this assertion, it did not raise thisissue in its Motion, and no transcript of the hearing on the Motion has beenincluded in the record.

by authorized JEFS Users for docketing and storage in JIMS and 
(2) the conversion and/or transmission of documents by JIMS Users directly into JIMS."  HEFSR Rule 1 (bold typeface omitted).  "The electronic filing of a document is deemed complete for all purposes under any of the Hawai# i Rules of Court when a Notice of 
Electronic Filing is generated."  HEFSR Rule 3.1.  Except for conventionally filed documents, "a document filed through JEFS or JIMS for docketing and storage in JIMS is deemed filed at the date and time stated on the Notice of Electronic Filing."  HEFSR Rule 3.3.  By contrast, the HEFSR provide that "[t]he clerk shall electronically file any paper document conventionally filed[,]" and that "[t]he receipt date and time reflected on the conventionally filed document and subsequently filed in JIMS shall be deemed the filing date. . . ."  HEFSR Rule 2.5. Therefore, even assuming SBB sent a copy of its unfiled motion to the Circuit Court via email, as counsel was required to electronically file documents on behalf of SBB and could not conventionally file the Motion, the September 10, 2020 electronic filing date governs.
4/  See State v. Crisp, CAAP-18-0000433, 2019 
WL 1715771, at *2 (Haw. App. Apr. 17, 2019).  
Accordingly, the Circuit Court correctly ruled it had 
no jurisdiction to consider SBB's Motion.  See Ranger Ins. Co., 83 Hawai# i at 124 n.5, 925 P.2d at 294 n.5.  Thus, we also reject 
SBB's argument that the circuit court should have considered reasons for good cause as to why execution of Forfeiture Judgment should not have issued.
5/ Id.  
4/    In urging the court to deem the Motion timely filed, SBB cites In
re Doe, 101 Hawai #i 220, 65 P.3d 167 (2003).  That case is distinguishable
inasmuch as it is a family court case governed by the Hawai #i
 Family Court 
Rules and to which the HEFSR did not apply.  SBB also appears to argue that
the court should apply HEFSR Rule 10 to excuse counsel's late filing.  But HEFSR Rule 10, which pertains to technical failures of JEFS or JIMS, does notapply here because SBB does not contend (or point to any record support) thata technical failure of JEFS or JIMS prevented it from timely filing theMotion. 
5/    While not listed in its points of error, SBB appears to contend
that because the defendant was "brought into custody within three days ofmissing Court . . . [i]t should be argued that the bail forfeiture should have
been set aside sua sponte [.]"  HRS § 804-51 "provides that once the court
enters a judgment of forfeiture a surety is entitled to relief only by filing
a motion within thirty days demonstrating good cause for setting the judgmentof forfeiture aside[.]"  Vaimili, 131 Hawai #i at 11, 313 P.3d at 700 (emphasis 
added).  As the Circuit Court here entered the Forfeiture Judgment, SBB wasrequired to seek relief under HRS § 804-51.
