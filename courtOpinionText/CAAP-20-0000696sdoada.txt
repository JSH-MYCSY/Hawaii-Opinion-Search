APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 2CC171000508(1)) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Wadsworth and McCullen, JJ.)
  Defendant-Appellant Mark Corba1 appeals from the 
Circuit Court of the Second Circuit's October 6, 2020 Judgment 
 
1 The caption reads: " Mark Corba a.k.a Mark Alan Corba a.k.a Mark-
Allan: Corba a.k.a. Mark- Allan: Corba; Mark-Allan: Corba, as Trustee of the 
Mark Corba Trust, a p rivate constructive Irrevocable Trust d ated October 14, 
2010[.]"  (F ormatting altered.)   
  
  
 
 
 
   
 
   
 
   
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and "Findings of Fact; Conclusions of Law; Order Granting 
Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment, and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure Against All Parties Filed January 14, 2020."
2 
On appeal, Corba asserts that the circuit court erred 
by granting Plaintiff-Appellee HSBC Bank USA, National Association for the Benefit of Ace Securities Corp. Home Equity Loan Trust, Series 2006-NC3, Asset Backed Pass-Through Certificates' (HSBC) January 14, 2020 Motion for Summary Judgment, and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure Against All Parties.
3 
Specifically, Corba contends that HSBC failed to 
establish standing, admissibility of its business records, adequate cancellation notice, and Select Portfolio Servicing's (SPS) Document Control Officer Mark Syphus (Syphus) as a qualified witness. Corba also contends the circuit court erred in declining to allow him to withdraw his automatic admissions. 
2 The Honorable Rhonda I.L. Loo presided. 
3 Corba did not preserve for appeal his arguments concerning New 
Century's bankruptcy, when Select Portfolio Servicing (SPS) obtained 
possession of the loan records, and the date the Note was indorsed. See 
Cnty. of Hawaiʻi v. C & J Coupe Fam. Ltd. P'ship, 119 Hawaiʻ i 352, 373, 198 
P.3d 615, 636 (2008) (explaining that "if a party does not raise an argument 
at trial, that argument will be deemed to have been waived on appeal"). 
2   
   Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
the issues raised and the arguments advanced by the parties, we resolve Corba's contentions as follows, and vacate and remand. 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Regarding his challenge to HSBC's standing to 
foreclose, Corba argues that the entity that allegedly had physical possession of the Note at the time the complaint was filed, Deutsche Bank, was unrelated to HSBC, and HSBC provides no proof of a custodial-agency relationship between HSBC and Deutsche Bank.  
At the outset, we emphasize that "[i]n order to prove 
entitlement to foreclose, the foreclosing party must demonstrate 
that all conditions precedent to foreclose under the note and 
mortgage are satisfied and that all steps required by statute have been strictly complied with." Bank of Am., N.A. v. Reyes-
Toledo
, 139 Hawaiʻi 361, 367, 390 P.3d 1248, 1254 (2017). Thus, 
the foreclosing party must "prove the existence of an agreement, the terms of the agreement, a default by the mortgagor under the terms of the agreement, and giving of the cancellation notice." 
Id. 
To establish standing to foreclose, a "plaintiff must 
necessarily prove its entitlement to enforce the note[.]" 
Reyes-Toledo
, 139 Hawai‘i at 368, 390 P.3d at 1255. When a note 
is indorsed in blank, it becomes payable to the bearer and may 
3   
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
be negotiated by transfer or possession alone. Id. at 370, 390 
P.3d at 1257. Thus, when a lender forecloses on a mortgage 
secured by a blank-indorsed note, the lender must establish that it held the note at the time it filed the complaint. See id.
A foreclosing party may establish it is the holder of 
a note by showing that its agent physically possesses it. See
e.g., U.S. Bank Tr., N.A. as Tr. for LSF9 Master Participation
Tr. v. Verhagen
, 149 Hawai‘i 315, 327-28, 489 P.3d 419, 431-32 
(2021). There must be evidence connecting the custodial agent 
with the principal. Cf., e.g.
, Bank of New York Mellon as Tr.
for Certificate-Holders CWABS Asset-Backed Notes Tr. 2006-SD4 v. 
Bautista
, 153 Hawai‘i 280, 534 P.3d 544, No. CAAP-17-0000621, 
2023 WL 4546454 at *8 (App. July 14, 2023) (am. mem. op.) 
(concluding that bailee letter from law office to third-party was insufficient to establish possession of note by the lender's agent in absence of any supporting evidence connecting the bailee or third-party to the lender, servicer, or lender's counsel). 
In his declaration, Syphus stated that he is an 
officer of SPS, HSBC's servicer for the subject loan.  Syphus further stated, "According to SPS's business records, [HSBC], through its custodian Deutsche Bank, has possession of the note in this instant action . . . and was in possession of the Note at the time of the filing of the complaint." 
4   
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Syphus then stated, "A true and correct copy of the 
documentation supporting note possession at the time of the 
filing of the complaint is attached as Exhibit '4' . . . ." Exhibit 4 appears to contain an entry prepared by "Jaren French, 
[SPS]" indicating that Deutsche Bank "[i]s the custodian in 
possession of the [N]ote" and that the Note was physically located in Santa Ana, California. 
However, there is nothing in Exhibit 4 to show that 
Deutsche Bank possessed the Note as the custodial agent for HSBC or to otherwise show a connection between HSBC, Deutsche Bank, and the Note. And HSBC does not point to any other evidence in the record to support Syphus' assertion. 
The two words - "its custodian" - in Syphus' 
declaration, "standing alone and uncorroborated by documentary evidence," were insufficient to show there was no genuine issue as to whether Deutsche Bank was HSBC's custodial agent and that HSBC was entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. See
Verhagen
, 149 Hawai‘i at 327, 489 P.3d at 431 (explaining that 
the declarant testified "U.S. Bank had actual or constructive possession of the Note at the time it filed the complaint," and that "[s]uch testimony, standing alone and uncorroborated by documentary evidence, would be insufficient to establish U.S. Bank possessed the Note when it filed the complaint"). Thus, 
the circuit court erred in granting HSBC's motion for summary 
5   
   
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
judgment. 
 U.S. Bank N.A. v. Mattos, 140 Hawaiʻi 26, 30, 398 P.3d 
615, 619 (2017) (reviewing the granting of summary judgment de 
novo).    
 
 Based on the foregoing, this court need not reach 
Corba's remaining contentions. We vacate the circuit court's October 6, 2020 Judgment, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this summary disposition order.
