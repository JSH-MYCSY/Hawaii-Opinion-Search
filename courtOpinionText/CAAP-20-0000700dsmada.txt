, CAAP-20-0000700, In the Interest of B Children, CAAP-
20-0000717, and in the Interest of B Children, CAAP-20-0000718,1 
it appears that: 
(1) On October 29, 2020, self-represented Mother-
Appellant (Mother) filed a notice of appeal in the underlying 
case, FC-S No. 14-00235, from the October 21, 2020 order terminating parental rights, which created the appeal in CAAP-20-0000700; 
(2) On December 7, 2020, the circuit court clerk 
notified the parties in CAAP-20-0000700 that the record on appeal had not been filed because Mother did not pay the filing fee or obtain a fee waiver; 
(3) On December 8, 2020, the record on appeal in CAAP-
20-0000700 was due but not filed. Therefore, Mother is in default of the record on appeal; 
1 The court takes judicial notice of the records filed in CAAP-20-
0000700, CAAP-20-0000717, and CAAP-20-0000718. Hawai #i Rules of Evidence

(4) On January 4, 2021, the appellate clerk in CAAP-20-
0000700 notified Mother to pay the filing fee or file a motion 
for leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis on or before 
January 14, 2021, or the matter would be brought to the court's attention and could result in sanctions, including dismissal of the appeal; 
(5) On February 9, 2021, the appellate clerk entered a 
default of the record on appeal in CAAP-20-0000700, informing Mother that the time to docket the appeal expired on December 8, 2020, she had not paid the filing fees or obtained an order allowing her to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis, the matter would be brought to the court's attention on February 18, 2021, for action that may include dismissal of the appeal, and she could seek relief from default by motion; 
(6) Mother took no further action in CAAP-20-0000700; (7) On November 18, 2020, Mother, through private 
counsel, Shawn A. Luiz (Luiz), filed a notice of appeal from the October 21, 2020 order terminating parental rights and the October 22, 2020 orders concerning the Child Protective Act in FC-S No. 14-00235, which created the appeal in CAAP-20-0000717; 
(8) On December 15, 2020, the circuit court clerk filed 
the record on appeal in CAAP-20-0000717, which identified Luiz as Mother's counsel. The abbreviated opening brief is due on or before March 3, 2021; 
(9) Meanwhile, on November 18, 2020, Mother filed 
another self-represented notice of appeal from the October 21, 2020 order terminating parental rights in the underlying case, which created the appeal in CAAP-20-0000718;
2 
(10) On December 15, 2020, the circuit court clerk 
notified the parties in CAAP-20-0000718 that the record on appeal had not been filed because Mother did not pay the filing fee or obtain a fee waiver; 
(11) The same day, the appellate clerk in CAAP-20-
0000718 notified Mother to pay the filing fee or file a motion 
2 It is not clear why Mother filed the second notice of appeal, or why
she apparently did not notify or identify Luiz as her counsel. Mother is 
cautioned that generally she should not file documents on her own in caseswhere she is represented by counsel.

for leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis on or before 
December 28, 2020, or the matter would be brought to the court's 
attention and could result in sanctions, including dismissal of the appeal; 
(12) On January 4, 2021, the appellate clerk entered a 
default of the record on appeal in CAAP-20-0000718, informing Mother that the time to docket the appeal expired on December 28, 2020, she had not paid the filing fees or obtained an order allowing her to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis, the matter would be brought to the court's attention on January 14, 2021, for action that may include dismissal of the appeal, and she could seek relief from default by motion; 
(13) Mother took no further action in CAAP-20-0000718; 
and 
(14) An appeal may be dismissed where the record on 
appeal has not been prepared because the appellant failed to pay the required fees or obtain an order allowing the appellant to proceed in forma pauperis. HRAP Rule 11(b)(2), (c)(2). Therefore, the court will dismiss the appeals in CAAP-20-0000700 and CAAP-20-0000718 for failure to pay the filing fees or obtain a fee waiver. In addition, Mother's self-represented appeals in CAAP-20-0000700 and CAAP-20-0000718 are duplicative of her appeal in CAAP-20-0000717, where she is represented by counsel, as all three appeals are from the same October 21, 2020 order terminating parental rights in the underlying case. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeals in 
CAAP-20-0000700 and CAAP-20-0000718 are dismissed. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the appellate clerk shall 
mail a copy of this order to attorney Shawn A. Luiz, at his mailing address on record with the 
Hawai#i State Bar Association.

Honolulu, Hawai#i, February 23, 2021.
