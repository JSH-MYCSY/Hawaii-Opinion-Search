  AMENDED  SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Wadsworth and Nakasone, JJ.)1
 
 
  Defendants-Appellants David Aureo Salvador Cordero and Mary Tan Llanos Cordero (collectively, Corderos
) appeal from the 
October 15, 2020 "Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to Amend Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Default Judgment Against Defendants Waialae Golf Course Community Association and Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure Against All Defendants on Complaint 
Filed October 30, 2014" (Order Granting Motion to Amend 
Foreclosure Decree),
2 filed and entered by the Circuit Court of 
the First Circuit (Circuit Court).3  
 
1  We amend our June 21, 2023 Summary Disposition Order pursuant to 
the Order granting reconsideration in part and denying in part, filed 
contemporaneously with this Amended Summary Disposition Order. 
 
2  The Corderos also appealed from the amended foreclosure decree 
and amended judgment entered on October 15, 2020, which we dismissed for lack 
of appellate jurisdiction on June 30, 2021 (Order of Partial Dismissal).  In 
the Order of Partial Dismissal, we determined that the October 15, 2020 amended judgment did not amend the original July 17, 2019 j udgment in a 
material and substantial way; the time to appeal ran from the original 
judgment; and the November 13, 2020 notice of appeal was untimely from that 
original July 17, 2019 judgment.  The Corderos' request for certiorari review 
of the Order of Partial Dismissal was rejected by the Hawai‘ i Supreme Court on 
September 7, 2021.  
See Wells Fargo Bank, Nat'l Ass'n, as Tr. for Structured 
Asset Sec. Corp. Mortg. Loan Tr. 2001- BC1, Pass Through Certificates, Series 
2007-BC1 v. Cordero, No. SCWC- 20-0000704, 2021 WL 4077556, at *1 (Sept. 7, 
2021).  We thus do not address the Corderos' first and third points of error (POEs), which challenged the grant of summary judgment leading to the entry 
of the July 17, 2019 foreclosure decree and judgment.  The first POE contended that the Corderos "were denied their due process rights because 
they and their attorney at the time, were not properly notified of the 
hearing on the Motion for Summary Judgment."  The third POE contended that 
the Circuit Court erroneously granted summary judgment on various substantive, evidentiary grounds.  As we noted in our June 30, 2021 Order of 
Partial Dismissal, we lack jurisdiction over the July 17, 2019 foreclosure decree and judgment, which includes the summary judgment.  The Corderos similarly acknowledge in their Reply Brief that this appeal is now limited to 
review of the October 15, 2020 Order Granting Motion to Amend Foreclosure 
Decree, which they challenge in POE 2.

On appeal, the Corderos contend that the Circuit Court 
plainly erred in granting Plaintiff-Appellee Wells Fargo Bank, 
National Association, as Trustee for Structured Asset Securities Corporation Mortgage Loan Trust 2007-BC1, Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2007-BC1's (Wells Fargo) Motion to Amend Foreclosure Decree because the Circuit Court did not have jurisdiction to "amend" a judgment by that motion, and the judgment should have instead been vacated and the foreclosure process begun anew.    Upon careful review of the record and the briefs submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we affirm.   On January 31, 2020, following the entry of the July 
17, 2019 foreclosure decree and judgment, Wells Fargo filed the 
Motion to Amend Foreclosure Decree as a non-hearing motion under 
Rules of the Circuit Court of the State of Hawai‘ i (RCCH) Rule 
7.2(c).
4  The Motion to Amend Foreclosure Decree sought to amend 
the July 17, 2019 foreclosure decree by including a missing 
exhibit, Exhibit "A", that was referred to in the foreclosure decree but not attached.  The Declaration of Counsel attached to the motion stated that the July 17, 2019 foreclosure decree "was missing the property description that was supposed to be attached as Exhibit A[,]" and that "[t]here [we]re no other changes to the Document."  The Corderos did not oppose the non-
hearing motion.  On October 15, 2020, the Circuit Court granted 
the motion, finding "good cause appearing therefor," stating:     
 
IT IS ORDERED that the Motion shall be and is hereby 
GRANTED.  The Amended Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law 
and Order Granting [Wells Fargo]'s Motion for Default 
 
 4  RCCH Rule 7.2(c), entitled "Non- hearing motions," provides in 
pertinent part that "[a]ny opposition to a non- hearing motion shall be filed 
and served no later than 10 days after the service date indicated on the 
certificate of service accompanying the motion or no later than 12 days after 
the service date if the motion is served by mail."  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST 'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 Judgment Against Defendants Waialae Golf Course Community 
Association and Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure 
Against All Defendants on Complaint filed October 30, 2014 
and Amended Judgment thereon with the property description 
attached shall be filed following the entry of this O rder.  
 
On the same date, the Circuit Court also filed the October 15, 
2020 amended foreclosure decree, identical to the previous July 17, 2019 foreclosure decree; but this time, the previously missing two-page exhibit was attached.  The Circuit Court also 
entered the October 15, 2020 amended judgment on the same date.  
 On appeal, the Corderos urge that their contention of 
error "should be considered as 'plain error' as at no time was 
the Motion for Leave to Amend [Foreclosure Decree] objected to."   The Corderos argue that the Circuit Court erroneously granted the Motion to Amend Foreclosure Decree because the motion cited 
inapposite court rules; an Hawai‘ i Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP) Rule 60 motion should have instead been filed; and the 
Circuit Court "did not have jurisdiction to entertain a motion to amend the judgment over six months after it was entered."
 
  "Questions regarding subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any stage of a cause of action."  Lingle v. Haw. 
Gov't Emps. Ass'n, AFSCME, Local 152, AFLO-CIO, 107 Hawai‘ i 178, 
182, 111 P.3d 587, 591 (2005) (quoting Amantiad v. Odum, 90 
Hawai‘i 152, 159, 977 P.2d 160, 167 (1999)).  While the Corderos 
request plain error review, we can nevertheless consider the Corderos' jurisdictional challenge at any time.  See id.   
 Here, we previously noted in our June 30, 2021 Order 
of Partial Dismissal that the amendment to the original judgment was based on a clerical mistake under HRCP Rule 60(a),
5 because 
 
 5  HRCP Rule 60, entitled "Relief from Judgment or Order," provides 
in subsection (a) that: 
 
 (a) Clerical m istakes. Clerical mistakes in 
judgments, orders or other parts of the record and errors 
therein arising from oversight or omission may be corrected by the court at any time of its own initiative or on the NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST 'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 the only proposed change was to attach the Exhibit "A" that was 
referred to, but not attached, to the original foreclosure 
decree.  We stated: 
 The Amended Judgment amended the circuit court's July 
17, 2019 "Judgment on [FOF/COL/Order]"[6] (Judgment).  The 
Amended Judgment differs from the Judgment only in that it 
refers to the Amended FOF/COL/Order rather than the 
FOF/COL/Order.  The Amended FOF/COL/Order differs from the 
original FOF/COL/Order only in that Exhibit "A" -- a Legal 
Description of the property referenced in the original FOF/COL/Order -- which was not attached to the original 
FOF/COL/Order, was attached to the Amended FOF/COL/Order 
upon Bank's motion under Rule 60(a) of the Hawai‘ i Rules of 
Civil Procedure based on an alleged clerical mistake 
(Motion to Amend). The original FOF/COL/Order did
 contain 
the address and TMK number for the subject property. 
 
(Footnote added.)   
  Although the Corderos contend that Wells Fargo failed to cite HRCP Rule 60(a) in its Motion to Amend Foreclosure 
Decree, this court has consistently recognized that "it is the 
substance of the pleading that controls, not its nomenclature."   Anderson v. Oceanic Props., Inc., 3 Haw. App. 
350, 355, 650 P.2d 612, 617 (1982) (citing Madden v. Madden, 
43 Haw. 148, 149-50 (Haw. Terr. 1959)).   Whether a court has jurisdiction to act is reviewed de novo under the right/wrong standard.  See Lester v. Rapp, 
85 Hawai‘ i 238, 241, 942 P.2d 502, 505 (1997).  We conclude the 
Circuit Court had jurisdiction to decide the Motion to Amend Foreclosure Decree.  HRCP Rule 60(a) permits the Circuit Court to correct clerical mistakes such as the omission of the exhibit 
 
motion of any party and after such notice, if any, as the 
court orders.  During the pendency of an appeal, such 
mistakes may be so corrected before the appeal is docketed, and thereafter while the appeal is pending may be so 
corrected with leave of the appellate court.

Law and Order Granting [Wells Fargo]'s Motion for Default Judgment Against Defendants Waialae Golf Course Community Association and Summary Judgment and 
Decree of Foreclosure Against A ll Defendants on Complaint Filed October 30,

 that was referenced in, but missing from, the original 
foreclosure decree "at any time . . . on the motion of any 
party" up until an appeal has docketed.  At the time the October 15, 2020 Order Granting Motion to Amend Foreclosure Decree was filed, the November 13, 2020 notice of appeal had not yet been filed, and the Circuit Court had jurisdiction to decide the Motion to Amend Foreclosure Decree.   
 
"An appellate court reviews a circuit court's 
determination of an HRCP Rule 60 motion for an abuse of discretion."  OneWest Bank, F.S.B. v. Ass'n of Owners of 
Kumulani at Uplands at Mauna Kea, 146 Hawai‘ i 105, 111, 456 P.3d 
178, 184 (2020) (quoting Buscher v. Boning, 114 Hawai‘ i 202, 211, 
159 P.3d 814, 823 (2007)).  The Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in granting the motion to correct a clerical error, as permitted under HRCP Rule 60(a).     For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the October 15, 2020 "Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to Amend Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Default Judgment Against Defendants Waialae Golf Course Community Association and Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure Against All Defendants on Complaint Filed October 30, 2014," filed and entered by the Circuit Court
