APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 1CC141002257)
ORDER
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Wadsworth, JJ.)
Upon consideration of Plaintiff-Appellee Wells Fargo
Bank, National Association's ( Bank) June 1, 2021 "Motion to
Dismiss Appeal from: (1) Amended Findings of Fact, Conclusions of
Law and Order Granting [Bank]'s Motion for Default Judgment
Against [Defendant-Appellee Waialae Golf Course Community
Association ( Waialae Golf Course)] and Summary Judgment and
Decree of Foreclosure Against All Defendants on Complaint Filed
October 30, 2014, entered October 15, 2020 [( Amended
FOF/COL/Order)] and (2) Amended Judgment, entered October 15,
2020" [(Amended Judgment )]," the papers in support and in
opposition, it appears we have jurisdiction over Defendants-
Appellants Davis Aureo Salvador Cordero and Mary Tan LlanosCordero's (collectively, the Corderos) appeal from the Circuit
Court of the First Circuit's ( circuit court) October 15, 2020
"Order Granting [Bank]'s Motion for Leave to Amend Findings of
Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting [Bank]'s Motion for
Default Judgment Against [Waialae Golf Course] and Summary
Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure Against All Defendants on
Complaint Filed October 30, 2014 [( FOF/COL/Order)]" (Order
Granting Motion to Amend ) but not the circuit court's Amended
Judgment and Amended FOF/COL/Order.
The Amended Judgment amended the circuit court's
July 17, 2019 "Judgment on [FOF/COL/Order]" ( Judgment).  The
Amended Judgment differs from the Judgment only in that it refers
to the Amended FOF/COL/Order rather than the FOF/COL/Order.  The
Amended FOF/COL/Order differs from the original FOF/COL/Order
only in that Exhibit "A" -- a Legal Description of the property
referenced in the original FOF/COL/Order -- which was not
attached to the original FOF/COL/Order, was attached to the
Amended FOF/COL/Order upon Bank's motion under Rule 60(a) of the
Hawai#i Rules of Civil Procedure based on an alleged clerical
mistake (Motion to Amend).  The original FOF/COL/Order did
contain the address and TMK number for the subject property. 
Because the Amended Judgment does not amend the
Judgment in a material and substantial way, the time to appeal
ran from entry of the Judgment.  See Weisenberg v. Univ. of
Hawaii, 138 Hawai#i 210, 215-16, 378 P.3d 926, 931-32 (2016);
Marlowe v. Lanai Resorts, LLC, No. CAAP-13-0003547, 2014 WL
551586, at *2 (App. Feb. 11, 2014) (Order Dismissing Appeal for
Lack of Appellate Jurisdiction).
The Corderos did not file the November 13, 2020 notice
of appeal within thirty days after entry of the July 17, 2019
Judgment as required by Hawai#i Rules of Appellate Procedure
(HRAP) Rule 4(a)(1).  Therefore, we lack appellate jurisdiction
with regard to the Judgment.  See Grattafiori v. State, 79
Hawai#i 10, 13, 897 P.2d 937, 940 (1995) ("[C]ompliance with the
requirement of the timely filing of a notice of appeal is
jurisdictional" and "[w]e must dismiss an appeal on our own
2motion if we lack jurisdiction."); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court
or judge or justice is authorized to change the jurisdictional
requirements contained in Rule 4 of these rules."); HRAP
Rule 26(e) ("The reviewing court for good cause shown may relieve
a party from a default occasioned by any failure to comply with
these rules, except the failure to give timely notice of
appeal.").
However, the Corderos filed the notice of appeal within
thirty days after the circuit court issued its October 15, 2020
Order Granting Motion to Amend, which is a final, appealable
post-judgment order.  Therefore, we have jurisdiction over the
Order Granting Motion to Amend.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion is
granted in part and denied in part as follows:
1.  The request to dismiss the appeal from the Amended
Judgment and Amended FOF/COL/Order is granted.
2.  All other requested relief is denied.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, June 30, 2021.
