ORDER GRANTING IN PART,  
DENYING IN PART, MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Wadsworth and Nakasone, JJ.) 
 
  Upon consideration 
of Defendants-Appellants David 
Aureo Salvador Cordero and Mary Tan Llanos Cordero's (collectively, Corderos) "Motion for Reconsideration from the NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST 'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
2 
 Intermediate Court of Appeals Summary Disposition Order Filed On 
June 21, 2013" (
Motion for Reconsideration) filed on July 3, 
2023, the papers in support, and the record, this court 
determines that reconsideration is warranted in part under 
Hawai‘i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 40, regarding 
the analysis of the Corderos's point of error on plain error and 
waiver; however, we deny reconsideration as to the remainder of 
the Motion for Reconsideration, as the Corderos do not present 
any point of law or fact that we overlooked or misapprehended.  See HRAP Rule 40(b). 
  Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion for Reconsideration is granted in part and denied in part, and an Amended Summary Disposition Order will be filed forthwith.   
  DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai‘ i, August 1, 2023.
