Leonard, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant George Van Blyenburg
 appeals from 
the "Judgment
 of Conviction and Sentence" entered by the Circuit 
Court of the First Circuit on October 28, 2020.1 For the reasons 
explained below, we affirm the Judgment. 
On August 6, 2016, a vehicle driven by Van Blyenburg 
struck and killed Brandon Kishida. On July 6, 2017, a grand jury 
indicted Van Blyenburg for Accidents Involving Death or Serious Bodily Injury in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 
§ 291C-12
2 (Count 1) and Negligent Homicide in the Second Degree 
1 The Honorable Fa'auuga L. To'oto'o presided.

(continued...) 2(...continued)NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
in violation of HRS § 707-703(1)(b)  (Count 2). Van Blyenburg 
pleaded not guilty. 3
Jury trial began on Tuesday, March 3, 2020, and 
continued on Wednesday. The State rested on Thursday. That 
afternoon, Van Blyenburg called his first witness. Trial was then recessed for the day. 
On Friday morning, March 6, 2020, the State filed its 
"Amended Jury Instructions Requested by the State of Hawai# i[.]" 
Van Blyenburg testified in his own defense that afternoon. 
On Monday, March 9, 2020, the circuit court instructed 
the jury. Counsel made their closing arguments. The jury returned a verdict that afternoon. 
Van Blyenburg was found 
guilty as charged on both counts. 
On October 20, 2020, Van Blyenburg filed a motion to 
dismiss Counts 1 and 2 of the indictment based on insufficiency of the charges.  The motion was heard on October 28, 2020,

to and in every event shall remain at the scene of the
accident until the driver has fulfilled the requirements ofsection 291C-14. Every such stop shall be made without
obstructing traffic more than is necessary . 
(Emphasis added.) 
3 HRS § 707-703 (2014) provides, in relevant part: 
Negligent homicide in the second degree . (1) A person
commits the offense of negligent homicide in the second
degree if that person causes the death of: 
. . . . 
(b) A vulnerable user by the operation of a vehiclein a manner that constitutes simple negligenceas defined in section 707-704(2). 
"Vulnerable user" includes "[a] pedestrian legally within a street or publichighway[.]" HRS § 707-700 (Supp. 2015). 
4 "Due to the significant consequences associated with omitting an
essential and material element in [a charge], an objection to this deficiencymay be raised 'at any time during the pendency of the proceeding.'" State v.

before the scheduled sentencing hearing. The circuit court 
orally denied the motion to dismiss. Van Blyenburg was then sentenced to 10 years in prison on Count 1 and 5 years in prison on Count 2, to run concurrently. On November 2, 2020, the circuit court entered its "Findings of Fact[], Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Counts 1 and 2 of the Indictment[.]" This appeal followed. 
Van Blyenburg contends that the circuit court erred by 
denying his motion to dismiss because: (1) Count 1 "failed to 
charge, allege, or provide notice of the attendant circumstances 
element that '[e]very such stop shall be made without obstructing traffic more than is necessary[]'"; and (2) Count 2 "does not 
define and give notice as to the element of conduct of 'simple negligence,' which is defined under § 707-704(2) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes in four varying and separate ways[.]" 
1. The circuit court did not err by denying
the motion to dismiss Count 1. 
Count 1 of the indictment alleged, in relevant part: 
On or about August 6, 2016, in the City and County ofHonolulu, State of Hawai #i, GEORGE VAN BLYENBURG, as the
driver of a vehicle involved in an accident resulting inserious bodily injury to or death of Brandon Kishida, withintent, knowledge, or reckless disregard of the substantialand unjustifiable risk that he was such a driver, didintentionally, knowingly, or recklessly fail to immediatelystop the vehicle at the scene of the accident or as closethereto as possible, and did intentionally, knowingly, orrecklessly fail to forthwith return to and in every eventremain at the scene of the accident . . . thereby committingthe offense of Accidents Involving Death or Serious BodilyInjury, in violation of Section 291C-12 of the Hawai #i 
Revised Statutes. 
Citing State v. Baker, 146 Hawai# i 299, 463 P.3d 956 (2020), Van 
Blyenburg argues that Count 1 was defective because it did not 
allege that he failed to stop his vehicle "without obstructing traffic more than is necessary." Whether a charge sets forth all the essential elements of a charged offense is a question of law, 
during the pendency of the proceedings [.])") (emphasis added).

which we review under the de novo, or right/wrong, standard. 
Baker, 146 Hawai# i at 305, 463 P.3d at 962. 
The defendant in Baker was convicted of failure to stop
at the scene of an accident involving vehicle damage, in violation of HRS § 291C-13.  The version of HRS § 291C-13 at 
5 
issue in Baker stated, in relevant part: 
Accidents involving damage to vehicle or property . The 
driver of any vehicle involved in an accident resulting only
in damage to a vehicle or other property that is driven orattended by any person shall immediately stop such vehicleat the scene of the accident or as close thereto as possible, but shall forthwith return to, and in every eventshall remain at, the scene of the accident until the driverhas fulfilled the requirements of section 291C-14. Every
such stop shall be made without obstructing traffic morethan is necessary . 
Baker, 146 Hawai# i at 302 n.1, 463 P.3d at 959 n.1 (citing HRS 
§ 291C-13 (Supp. 2008)) (emphasis added). The charge in Baker 
"did not include any reference to the language 'without obstructing traffic more than is necessary' or include language similar to it." Id. at 308, 463 P.3d at 965. The supreme court 
held that the charge "failed to give Baker proper notice of the elements of the offense with which she was charged[.]" Id. 
Van Blyenburg challenges the following conclusions of 
law made by the circuit court: 
2. As to Count 1 of the Indictment: 
. . . . e. Baker contains no indication that the decision 
should apply retroactively.[
6] 
. . . . g. Given the foregoing, Baker is inapplicable to
the instant case. 
5 The relevant provisions of HRS § 291C-13 substantially mirror
those of HRS § 291C-12. State v. Armitage, No. CAAP-19-0000814, 2021 WL
4936967, at *2 (Haw. App. Oct. 22, 2021) (SDO). 
6 Baker was published on March 13, 2020, four days after the jury
found Van Blyenburg guilty. 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
h. As such, the Court finds Defendant's contention
that Count 1 of the Indictment is defective to be without 
merit. 
Conclusions of law are reviewed under the right/wrong 
standard. State v. Alvarez, 138 Hawai# i 173, 181, 378 P.3d 889, 
897 (2016). The circuit court's conclusions of law were wrong. 
In Baker, after ruling that the charge was defective, the supreme court vacated Baker's conviction. 
If the supreme court had 
intended that its decision have prospective effect only, it would not have vacated Baker's conviction. Cf. State v. Jones, 148 
Hawai
#i 152, 174-76, 468 P.3d 166, 188-90 (2020) (applying a 
holding prospectively and not to the case at bar); State v. Torres, 144 Hawai# i 282, 292-95, 439 P.3d 234, 244-47 (2019) 
(same); State v. Jess, 117 Hawai# i 381, 404, 184 P.3d 133, 156 
(2008) (same). 
Although the circuit court's conclusion that Baker did 
not "apply retroactively" was wrong, the circuit court did not err by denying the motion to dismiss Count 1.
7 In Baker the 
defendant challenged the sufficiency of the charge for the first time on appeal; accordingly, the supreme court applied the "liberal construction" standard in reviewing the charge. 146 Hawai# i at 308, 463 P.3d at 965. In this case, Van Blyenburg 
challenged the sufficiency of the charge at the trial level. Accordingly, "in determining whether [Van Blyenburg] has been adequately informed of the charges against him, [we] can consider other information in addition to the charge that may have been provided to [him] during the course of the case up until the time [he] objected to the sufficiency of the charges against him." State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai# i 383, 396, 219 P.3d 1170, 1183 
(2009); State v. Treat, 67 Haw. 119, 120, 680 P.2d 250, 251 (1984); see also State v. Hitchcock, 123 Hawai# i 369, 379, 235 
P.3d 365, 375 (2010) (in case where defendant argued the charge was defective for the first time on appeal, supreme court 
7 The circuit court's ruling "will not be disturbed on the ground
that the circuit court gave the wrong reasons for the ruling." Flores v. 
Ballard, 149 Hawai #i 81, 88, 482 P.3d 544, 551 (App. 2021) (citation omitted).

"examine[d] the information provided or 'supplied' by the 
prosecution to Hitchcock prior to appeal."). 
The State filed and served its amended requested jury 
instructions before Van Blyenburg testified at trial. State's amended instruction no. 1 stated: 
In Count 1, the Defendant, GEORGE VAN BLYENBURG, is
charged with the offense of Accidents Involving Death or
Serious Bodily Injury. 
A person commits the offense of Accidents Involving
Death or Serious Bodily Injury if he intentionally,knowingly, or recklessly, as the driver of any vehicleinvolved in an accident resulting in serious bodily injuryto, or death of, any person, did not immediately stop thevehicle at the scene of the accident, or as close thereto aspossible and return to and remain at the scene of theaccident, and fulfill the Duty to Give Information andRender Aid. 
There are four material elements of the offense of 
Accidents Involving Death or Serious Bodily Injury, each ofwhich the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt. 
These four elements are: 
1. That on or about August 6, 2016, in the City and
County of Honolulu, State of Hawai #i, the
Defendant was the driver of a vehicle involved in an accident resulting in serious bodilyinjury to, or the death of, Brandon Kishida; and 
2. The Defendant failed to immediately stop hisvehicle at the scene of the accident, or asclose thereto as possible and return to andremain at the scene of the accident, provided
that every stop shall be made withoutobstructing traffic more than necessary ; and 
3. The Defendant failed to fulfill the Duty to GiveInformation and Render Aid; and 
4. The Defendant acted intentionally, knowingly, orrecklessly as to each of the foregoing elements. 
(Emphasis added.)  When Van Blyenburg moved to dismiss Count 1, 
he had already been provided with information about the attendant 
circumstance element that "every stop shall be made without obstructing traffic more than necessary[.]" Because Van Blyenburg had been provided with information about the element missing from Count 1 of the indictment before he moved to dismiss 8

the charge, the circuit court did not err by denying the motion. 
Treat, 67 Haw. at 120, 680 P.2d at 251. 
2. The circuit court did not err by denying the
motion to dismiss Count 2. 
Count 2 of the indictment alleged: 
On or about August 6, 2016, in the City and County ofHonolulu, State of Hawai #i, GEORGE VAN BLYENBURG did cause
the death of Brandon Kishida, who was a vulnerable user, towit, a pedestrian legally within a street or public highway,by the operation of a vehicle in a manner that constitutessimple negligence as defined in Section 707-704(2) of theHawai #i Revised Statutes , thereby committing the offense of
Negligent Homicide in the Second Degree, in violation ofSection 707-703(1)(b) of the Hawai #i Revised Statutes. 
In 
accordance with Section 264-1(a) of the Hawai #i Revised 
Statutes, "public highway" means all roads, alleys, streets,ways, lanes, bikeways, bridges, and all other real propertyhighway related interests in the State, opened, laid out,subdivided, consolidated, and acquired and built by thegovernment. In accordance with Section 291C-1 of the Hawai #i Revised Statutes, "street" means the entire width
between boundary lines of every way publicly maintained whenany part thereof is open to the use of the public forpurposes of vehicular travel. 
(Emphasis added.) Van Blyenburg argues that Count 2 "is 
defective in that it does not define and give notice as to the element of conduct of 'simple negligence,' which is defined under § 707-704(2) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes[.]" 
HRS § 707-704 (2014) (negligent homicide in the third 
degree) provides, in relevant part: 
(2) "Simple negligence" as used in this section: 
(a) A person acts with simple negligence with respect to
the person's conduct when the person should be awareof a risk that the person engages in that conduct. 
(b) A person acts with simple negligence with respect toattendant circumstances when the person should beaware of a risk that those circumstances exist. 
(c) A person acts with simple negligence with respect to aresult of the person's conduct when the person shouldbe aware of a risk that the person's conduct willcause that result. 
(d) A risk is within the meaning of this subsection if theperson's failure to perceive it, considering thenature and purpose of the person's conduct and thecircumstances known to the person, involves a 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
deviation from the standard of care that a law-abiding
person would observe in the same situation. 
Van Blyenburg challenges the following conclusions of 
law made by the circuit court: 
3. As to Count 2 of the Indictment: 
. . . . d. Terms with different statutory and common,
everyday definitions only need to be defined in a charging
document where the term is an element of the charge. See 
Baker
, 146 Hawai #i at 308, 463 P.3d at 965 ("A complaint[]
. . . cannot reasonably be construed to charge an offense. . . when the common definition of an element of an offense 
set forth in the charge does not comport with its statutorydefinition [and the charging document does not include thestatutory definition.]") (emphasis added). 
e. Given the foregoing, "simple negligence" is not
an element of Negligent Homicide in the Second Degree,H.R.S. § 707-703(1)(b). 
f. As such, the Court finds that "simple
negligence" need not be defined in Count 2 of theIndictment. 
g. Thus, the Court further finds that Count 2 of
the Indictment is sufficient. 
Van Blyenburg relies on Wheeler, 121 Hawai# i at 393, 219 P.3d at 
1180 (holding that failure to allege defendant was driving his 
vehicle "upon a public way, street, road, or highway" at time of offense rendered charge deficient); State v. Kauhane, 145 Hawai# i 
362, 372, 452 P.3d 359, 369 (2019) (holding that charge, which did not include statutory definition of "obstructs," was deficient where statutory definition did not reflect commonly understood meaning of term); and State v. Pacquing, 139 Hawai# i 
302, 308, 389 P.3d 897, 903 (2016) (holding that charge, which did not include statutory definition of "confidential personal information," was deficient where statutory definition was "not readily comprehensible to persons of common understanding[.]"). 
We need not decide whether the circuit court's 
conclusions of law were right or wrong. Although Count 2 of the indictment did not recite the statutory definition of "simple negligence," the State's original requested jury instructions, filed on May 22, 2018 (almost two years before the trial), and 
8  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the State's amended requested jury instructions (filed the 
morning before Van Blyenburg testified at trial) both contained the complete statutory definition of "simple negligence."
9 
Because Van Blyenburg had been provided with the statutory definition of "simple negligence" missing from Count 2 of the indictment before he moved to dismiss the charge, the circuit court did not err by denying the motion. State v. Armitage, 
No. CAAP-19-0000814, 2021 WL 4936967, at *6 (Haw. App. Oct. 22, 2021) (SDO) (holding that where State filed proposed jury instructions a month before trial that included statutory definition of "under the influence," defendant had ample notice of precisely what she must be prepared to meet at trial) (citing State v. Mita, 124 Hawai# i 385, 390, 245 P.3d 458, 463 (2010)); 
see also Wheeler, 121 Hawai# i at 391, 219 P.3d at 1178 (quoting 
State v. Wells, 78 Hawai# i 373, 379–80, 894 P.2d 70, 76–77 
(1995)). 
For the foregoing reasons, the "Judgment of Conviction 
and Sentence" entered by the circuit court on October 28, 2020, is affirmed.
