CHRISTOPHER J. HIGHEAGLE, Defendant-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 2CPC-20-0000318(3)) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: 
Leonard, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
Plaintiff-Appellant State of Hawai# i (State) appeals 
from the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law; Order Granting 
Motion to Suppress Evidence, filed on October 27, 2020, in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (
Circuit Court).1 In that 
order, the Circuit Court suppressed Defendant-Appellee Christopher J. Higheagle's (Higheagle) blood alcohol 
concentration (BAC) test results from a blood draw performed 
pursuant to a judicial search warrant obtained after Higheagle 
refused to be tested as provided in Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 
§ 291E-15 (2020).

1 The Honorable Kelsey T. Kawano presided. 
2 HRS § 291E-15 provides: 
If a person under arrest refuses to submit to a breath,
blood, or urine test, none shall be given, except asprovided in section 291E-21. Upon the law enforcementofficer's determination that the person under arrest hasrefused to submit to a breath, blood, or urine test, ifapplicable, then a law enforcement officer shall:

On appeal, the State challenges the Circuit Court's 
Conclusions of Law (COL) numbers 19, 28, and 29,  and argues that 3
(1) Inform the person under arrest of the sanctions
under section 291E-41 or 291E-65; and 
(2) Ask the person if the person still refuses tosubmit to a breath, blood, or urine test,thereby subjecting the person to the proceduresand sanctions under part III or section 291E-65,as applicable; 
provided that if the law enforcement officer fails to complywith paragraphs (1) and (2), the person shall not be subjectto the refusal sanctions under part III or IV. 
(Emphasis added.) 
In 2021, the legislature amended this section to include, as an
exception, "a search warrant issued by a judge upon a finding of probablecause supported by oath or affirmation, or pursuant to any other basispermissible under the Constitution of the State of [Hawai #i] and laws of this
State."

https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2021/bills/SB412_CD1_.htm  (accessed
October 22, 2021). 
The legislature also specified that "[t]his Act does not
affect rights and duties that matured, penalties that were incurred, andproceedings that were begun before its effective date." Id.The effective 
date was June 23, 2021. Governor's Message 1161 (2021), available athttps://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2021/bills/GM1161_.PDF  (accessed
October 22, 2021). 
Because these proceedings commenced prior to June 23, 2021, and "[n]o
law has any retrospective operation, unless otherwise expressed or obviouslyintended[,]" this amendment does not apply to Higheagle. HRS § 1-3 (2009);State v. Dudoit, 90 Hawai #i 262, 268 n.3, 978 P.2d 700, 706 n.3 (1999)
(explaining that the "legislature cannot change the intent behind a statutethrough subsequent amendments that do not have retroactive effect"). 
3 COLs 19, 28, and 29 states: 
19. The core provision to the effect that no tests
shall be given if a driver refuses to submit to testing, ifread as permissive, would render such provision superfluous,contrary to basic tenants of statutory construction.Obtainment of a search warrant by an officer after adriver's exercise of the right of refusal would violate HRS§ 291E-15 and render such "right" an illusory nullity.Permitting an officer to offer a driver the "right" ofrefusal, only to repudiate such refusal with a supercedingsearch warrant is akin to offering no meaningful choice at
all, contrary to the principles set out in Wilson and Won. 
Such procedure carries with it the possibility of other
negative effects such as giving an air of credence tofeigned advisements by police, and the potential forarbitrary enforcement. 
. . . . 
28. 
Based on statutory construction and caselaw, the
[Hawai #i] implied consent law is not the exclusive means by
which police may obtain chemical testing in Chapter 291E OUI

"[Hawaii's] Implied Consent framework does not preempt the 
application of traditional search and seizure principles to [operating a vehicle under the influence of intoxicants (OVUII)] 
criminal prosecutions." 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and due consideration of the arguments 
advanced and the issues raised, we resolve the State's point of error as follows: 
The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution 
and article I, section 7 of the Hawai# i Constitution "guarantee 
the right of persons to be free from unreasonable searches," and a blood draw is a search under these principles. See State v. 
Hosaka, 148 Hawai# i 252, 258, 472 P.3d 19, 25 (2020). A search 
that is "[a]n invasion of bodily integrity implicates an individual's most personal and deep-rooted expectations of privacy." State v. Won, 137 Hawai# i 330, 338, 372 P.3d 1065, 
1073 (2015) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). On the other hand, the legislature continually grapples with the dangers of OVUII, finding that it "is a serious offense that contributed to over fifty percent of traffic fatalities in 2015 and 2016." 
S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1963, in 2019 Senate 
Journal, at 1740. 
Here, in deciding if Higheagle's BAC test result was 
properly suppressed, we must determine whether a law enforcement 
criminal investigations. The [ Hawai #i] implied consent law
does not supercede the authority of the police to resort to
a search warrant as an alternative means of obtainingcriminal evidence against intoxicated drivers. Police mayapply for a search warrant in lieu of the [Hawai #i] implied
consent law which does not mandatorily apply to every arrestfor OUI. However, the police after having opted to proceedunder the [Hawai #i] implied consent law, thereby subjecting
an individual to the procedures under HRS § 291E-11 may not
thereafter circumvent the statutory right of refusal under
HRS § 291E-11(b)(2) and HRS § 291E-15 by obtaining a searchwarrant in the event the individual refuses consent to the search, as was done in the instant case. 
29. Suppression of the evidence is an appropriate
remedy because the police violated defendant's statutoryright of refusal which led directly to the obtaining of theevidence to be suppressed.

officer may obtain a search warrant ordering a person to submit 
to alcohol concentration or drug content testing for purposes of HRS chapter 291E when that person withdraws consent for (or refuses) such testing as specifically provided for in HRS § 291E-15. We review the granting of the motion to suppress evidence 
"de novo to determine whether the ruling was 'right' or 'wrong.'" State v. Spillner, 116 Hawai# i 351, 357, 173 P.3d 498, 504 
(2007). 
"[C]onsent is a well-established exception to the 
requirement that a warrant be obtained before a search takes place." Hosaka, 148 Hawai# i at 258, 472 P.3d at 25 (citing Won, 
137 Hawai# i at 340, 372 P.3d at 1075). In applying the consent 
exception to the framework for OVUII, HRS chapter 291E provides that a person driving on a public road is deemed to have consented to a breath, blood, or urine test to determine alcohol concentration or drug content: 
Any person who operates a vehicle upon a public way,
street, road, or highway or on or in the waters of the State
shall be deemed to have given consent, subject to this part,to a test or tests approved by the director of health of theperson's breath, blood, or urine for the purpose ofdetermining alcohol concentration or drug content of theperson's breath, blood, or urine . . . . 
HRS § 291E-11(a) (2020). 
These tests are administered "at the request of a law 
enforcement officer having probable cause to believe the person 
operating a vehicle upon a public way, street, road, or highway . . . is under the influence of an intoxicant . . . ." HRS § 291E-11(b) (2020). This may occur "only after: (1) [a] lawful arrest; and (2) [t]he person has been informed by a law enforcement officer that the person may refuse to submit to testing under this chapter." HRS § 291E-11(b). 
Germane to this appeal, "[i]f a person under arrest 
refuses to submit to a breath, blood, or urine test, none shall be given, except as provided in section 291E-21." HRS § 291E-15 (emphasis added). When a person refuses to submit to a breath, blood, or urine test, the law enforcement officer shall also inform the person under arrest of the sanctions under HRS §§ 291E-41 and 291E-65, and part III of HRS chapter 291E. HRS § 291E-15; see supra note 2. Should a person still refuse, HRS 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
chapter 291E instructs that the law enforcement officer "shall 
complete and issue to the person a notice of administrative revocation and shall indicate thereon whether the notice shall serve as a temporary permit." HRS § 291E-33(c) (2020). 
"Based on the statutory provisions of the implied 
consent law, see HRS §§ 291E-11(b), 291E-15, 291E-65(a), and the protections of the Hawai# i Constitution as interpreted by the 
decisions of this court, a person may refuse consent to submit to a BAC test, and the State must honor that refusal." Won, 137 
Hawai#i at 345, 372 P.3d at 1080 (emphasis added). Thus, when a 
person under arrest for OVUII exercises his or her right to refuse to submit to a breath, blood, or urine test, the language of HRS § 291E-15 is plain—"none shall be given." See State v. 
Young, 107 Hawai# i 36, 39, 109 P.3d 677, 680 (2005) (providing 
that "[w]hen construing a statute, our foremost obligation is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the language contained in the statute itself"). 
The plain language of HRS § 291E-15 also makes clear 
that the only exception to "none shall be given" is if there was a "collision resulting in injury to or the death of any person" pursuant to HRS § 291E-21 (2020). By designating HRS § 291E-21 as the only exception to the mandate that "none shall be given," the legislature did so to the exclusion of other alternatives. Fagaragan v. State, 132 Hawai# i 224, 242, 320 P.3d 889, 907 
(2014) (explaining that "the canon of construction expressio unius est exclusio alterius[] holds that 'to express or include one thing implies the exclusion of the other, or of the alternative'"). 
Notably, a search warrant was not an alternative 
exception. 
In addition to providing a specific exception to "none 
shall be given," HRS chapter 291E sets forth the subsequent steps a law enforcement officer must take should there be a refusal to submit to a breath, blood, or urine test. After a refusal, "the law enforcement officer shall complete and issue to the person a notice of administrative revocation and shall indicate thereon whether the notice shall serve as a temporary permit." 
HRS 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
§ 291E-33(c). Thus, the legislature intentionally laid out 
specific steps a law enforcement officer must follow regarding OVUII testing, again, to the exclusion of alternatives. Obtaining a search warrant was not one of these steps. 
Similar to HRS § 291E-15, HRS § 291E-65 provides that 
if a person under the age of twenty-one years who is "under arrest for operating a vehicle after consuming a measurable amount of alcohol, . . . refuses to submit to a breath or blood test, none shall be given, except as provided in section 291E-21[.]" HRS § 291E-65(a) (2020) (emphasis added); See HRS § 1-16 (2009) (providing that "[l]aws in pari materia or upon the same subject matter, shall be construed with reference to each other"). After a refusal to submit to testing, HRS § 291E-65 instructs that "the arresting law enforcement officer, as soon as practicable, shall submit an affidavit to a district judge of the circuit in which the arrest was made[,]" and that the district judge shall hold a hearing within twenty days of receiving the affidavit. HRS §§ 291E-65(a) and (b) (2020). Like HRS § 291E-15, the language of HRS § 291E-65 provides that if there is a refusal to submit to breath and blood testing, "none shall be given" with only one exception, and provides specific steps for a law enforcement officer to take following the refusal. This section contemplates an affidavit for a judicial hearing, but makes no mention of an affidavit for a judicial search warrant. 
In sum, the legislature plainly provided for a right to 
refuse to submit to testing, with notice to the person arrested and specific procedures for the law enforcement officer to follow. The legislature did not, however, provide for obtaining a search warrant following an HRS § 291E-15 refusal. 
To support its argument, the State relies on HRS 
§§ 803-31 (Supp. 2019)
4 and 803-32(5) (2014).5 However, a 
4 HRS § 803-31 provides as follows: 
A search warrant is an order in writing or issued
otherwise pursuant to section 803-33.5 made by a judge or
other magistrate, directed to an officer of justice,commanding the officer to search for certain articlessupposed to be in the possession of, or anticipated to be inthe possession of, one who is charged with having obtained
(continued...) 
6 4(...continued)NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"search warrant can be granted in no case but on an affidavit 
setting forth sufficient facts in the opinion of the magistrate to justify the issuing of the warrant." HRS § 803-33 (2014). If an affidavit seeks BAC testing for the purposes of HRS chapter 291E, but sets forth facts that a person refused testing under HRS § 291E-15, a magistrate cannot justify issuing a warrant for testing because under those facts HRS §§ 291E-15 and 65 mandate that "none shall be given." And permitting a law enforcement officer to apply for a search warrant following an HRS § 291E-15 refusal renders "none shall be given" a nullity and the notice procedures an empty exercise. We cannot interpret statutes as such because "repeal by implication is disfavored." State v. 
Delima, 78 Hawai# i 343, 347, 893 P.2d 194, 198 (1995) (citation 
and internal quotation marks omitted). 
The State also relies on the Circuit Court's 
interpretation of HRS § 291E-17 (2020) for the proposition that it "implicitly approves use of a search warrant to obtain a blood sample[.]" HRS § 291E-17 provides that Part II, entitled Testing and Implied Consent, "shall not limit the introduction of any other competent evidence bearing on the question of whether the person was under the influence of an intoxicant or was operating a vehicle while under the age of twenty-one and after consuming a measurable amount of alcohol." (Emphasis added.) This section speaks to the admission, not acquisition, of evidence. For example, even if a person refuses testing, HRS § 291E-17 nonetheless permits the introduction of evidence such as the testimony of a law enforcement officer as to his or her relevant 
them illegally, or who keeps them illegally, or with the
intent of using them as the means of committing a certainoffense. 
5 HRS § 803-32(5) provides as follows: 
The power of granting this writ is one in the exercise
of which much is necessarily left to the discretion of themagistrate, but, except in cases where this power iselsewhere specially granted by statute, search warrants canbe granted only for the following purposes: . . . (5) Todiscover articles necessary to be produced as evidence orotherwise on the trial of any one accused of a criminaloffense. 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
observations. No language in HRS § 291E-17, however, authorizes 
a law enforcement officer to acquire a person's breath, blood, or urine following a refusal. 
Based on the foregoing, we hold that the Circuit Court 
did not err in suppressing, for the purposes of HRS chapter 291E, Higheagle's BAC test results from a blood draw performed pursuant to a judicial search warrant obtained after Higheagle refused to be tested under HRS § 291E-15. This holding is consistent with the Hawai# i Supreme Court's determination that "a person may 
refuse consent to submit to a BAC test, and the State must honor that refusal." Won, 137 Hawai# i at 345, 372 P.3d at 1080; See 
Won, 137 Hawai# i at 367-368, 372 P.3d at 1102-1103 (Nakayama, J., 
dissenting) (explaining that "[a]lthough the state may undoubtedly compel an arrestee against his or her will to submit to a blood draw if it obtains a warrant, Hawaii's implied consent regime removes that possibility by requiring officers to honor refusal"). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Circuit 
Court's Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law; Order Granting Motion to Suppress Evidence, filed on October 27, 2020 is affirmed.
