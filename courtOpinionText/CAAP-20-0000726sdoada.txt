APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 1CC111000497)  
 
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellee/Cross-Appellant GP Services, LLC 
appeals from the Circuit Court of the First Circuit's  
October 20, 2020 "Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part 
Defendant GP Services, LLC's Motion for Attorneys' Fees and 1
1 The Honorable Gary W.B. Chang presided.    
 
   
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Costs Filed on May 3, 2017" (Fees and Costs Order) and 
October 20, 2020 Final Judgment. The circuit court's October 1, 
2021 First Amended Final Judgment (Amended Judgment) affirmed 
its original grant of costs in its Fees and Costs Order. 
On appeal, GP challenges the circuit court's Fees and 
Costs Order. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve this 
appeal as discussed below and affirm. 
(1)  GP contends the circuit court "abused its 
discretion by not designating GP as the prevailing party as 
against" Plaintiff-Intervenor-Appellee/Cross-Appellee Hawaii 
Employers' Mutual Insurance Company, Inc. (HEMIC). (Formatting 
altered.) 
Hawai‘i
 Arbitration Rules (HAR) Rule 25 defines 
"prevailing party" in a trial de novo as "the party who (1) appealed and improved upon the arbitration award by 30% or 
more, or (2) did not appeal and the appealing party failed to 
improve upon the arbitration award by 30% or more." HAR Rule 25(A). 
According to the Fees and Costs Order, the issue "came 
on for oral hearing on June 1, 2017 . . . ." 
The June 1, 2017 
circuit court minutes show that there was a 30-minute hearing, 
2    
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and the circuit court "concluded that only Mr. Davis is subject 
to [Court Annexed Arbitration Program] sanctions because 
Mr. Davis was the only party that filed the request for trial de 
novo and notice of appeal." (Formatting altered.) 
GP does not point to where in the record HEMIC 
appealed from the arbitration award. GP instead argues that the 
circuit court should have exercised its inherent authority to 
designate HEMIC an appealing party. "However, the Supreme Court has cautioned that because of the very potency of a court's 
inherent power, it should be exercised with restraint and 
discretion." Enos v. Pac. Transfer & Warehouse, Inc., 79 
Hawaii ‘ 
452, 458, 903 P.2d 1273, 1279 (1995) (cleaned up). And there 
was no reason for the circuit court to invoke its inherent 
authority when HAR Rule 25 specifically speaks to the issue. 
(2) GP also contends the circuit "abused its 
discretion by not awarding attorneys' fees against Davis and 
HEMIC" and not awarding all of its costs. 
(Formatting altered.) 
HAR Rule 26(A) provides that "[a]fter the verdict is 
received and filed, or the court's decision rendered in a trial 
de novo, the trial court may, in its discretion, impose sanctions . . . against the non-prevailing party whose appeal 
resulted in the trial de novo." (Emphasis added.) "[A]n abuse 
of discretion occurs where the trial court has clearly exceeded 
the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles of law 
3    
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant." 
Enoka v. AIG Haw. Ins. Co.
, 109 Hawai‘i 537, 544, 128 P.3d 850, 
857 (2006) (quoting 
Price v. AIG Haw. Ins. Co.
, 107 Hawai‘i 106, 
110, 111 P.3d 1, 5 (2005)). 
Possible sanctions include "[r]easonable costs and 
fees (other than attorneys' fees) actually incurred by the party 
but not otherwise taxable under the law, including, but not limited to, expert witness fees, travel costs, and deposition 
costs" and "[a]ttorneys' fees not to exceed $15,000[.]" 
HAR 
Rule 26(B)(1), (3). "In determining sanctions, if any, the court shall consider all the facts and circumstances of the case 
and the intent and purpose of the" Court Annexed Arbitration 
Program. HAR Rule 26(D). 
GP does not argue that the circuit court failed to 
"consider all the facts and circumstances of the case and the intent and purpose" of the Court Annexed Arbitration Program. 
GP also does not explain how the circuit court exceeded the 
bounds of reason or disregarded the law. 
The June 1, 2017 minutes show that the circuit court 
"addressed costs" and "gave its reasons . . . ." (Formatting 
altered.) As to sanctions under HAR Rule 26, the minutes note 
that the circuit court "exercised its discretion and did not 
award [Court Annexed Arbitration Program] sanctions against Mr. Davis." (Formatting altered.)

Hawai‘i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 10(b)(1)(A) 
provides that "[w]hen an appellant desires to raise any point on 
appeal that requires consideration of the oral proceedings before the circuit court appealed from," the appellant must 
order the transcripts within 10 days of filing the notice of 
appeal. GP failed to comply with this rule, and without a 
transcript of the June 1, 2017 hearing, we will not conclude the 
circuit court abused its discretion based on what transpired 
during the hearing. See State v. Hoang, 93 Hawai‘ i 333, 336, 3 
P.3d 499, 502 (2000) ("Without the relevant transcript, there is 
insufficient evidence to review the alleged error, and [the 
appellant] carries the burden of demonstrating the alleged error 
in the record
."). 
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the circuit court's 
October 20, 2020 Fees and Costs Order and October 1, 2021 Amended Judgment. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai‘i, October 31, 2024.
