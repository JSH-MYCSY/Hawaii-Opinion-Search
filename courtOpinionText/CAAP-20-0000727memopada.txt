RSG Enterprises, LLC ( RSG) (collectively referred to as the 
business entities ) cross-appeal from the Judgment. 
On appeal, Roland raises ten points of error, 
consolidated as follows, in which he contends that the circuit 
court erred by:2 
1. Denying his motions for summary judgment, and 
Judgment as a Matter of Law (JMOL) on GI's 
counterclaim (points of error 1, 10); 
2. Granting Robert's motions for summary judgment and 
JMOL on Roland's claims for breach of fiduciary 
duties based on kinship, conspiracy, unfair business 
practices, and punitive damages (points of error 2, 
3, 4, 5); 
3. Denying him prejudgment interest, and delaying entry 
of the judgment (points of error 6, 8); 
4. Denying him a preferential dividend so that all 
damages awarded by the jury go to him (point of 
error 7); and 
5. Denying him attorney's fees and costs (point of 
error 9).

1. Denying their Renewed JMOL on Roland's claims; 
2. Allowing Roland to dismiss his claim for corporate 
dissolution without imposing conditions; and 
3. Denying them attorney's fees and costs. 
Upon careful review of the record and relevant legal 
authorities, and having given due consideration to the arguments 
advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve their 
points of error as follows. 
I. Background 
This case involves a business dispute between two 
brothers, Robert and Roland Guieb. On June 19, 2018, Roland 
filed a First Amended Complaint ( FAC), in which he alleged he 
was the minority shareholder of GI, his brother Robert was the 
majority shareholder and an officer and director, and that 
Robert took opportunities and assets of GI to benefit himself 
and his other businesses, Pacific Welding and GG. He alleged 
that RSG, held equally by Roland and Robert, owned the real 
property that served as GI's prin cipal place of business, and 
Pacific Welding was conducting business from RSG's property 
without paying for its use. Roland also claimed that Robert 
misappropriated GI's trade name, "Exhaust Systems Hawaii," that 
Robert used GI's trade name for a shop he opened in Kalihi (the 
Kalihi Shop ), and that Robert took GI's Honolulu shop for 
himself. 
The FAC asserted claims for: (1) judicial dissolution 
of GI; (2) usurping corporate opportunity/conversion/unjust 
enrichment; (3) breaches  of fiduciary duties; (4) breaches  of 
fiduciary duties arising out of kinship; (5) accounting/audit; 
(6) fraud/misrepresentation/nondisclosure; (7) "Squeeze Out" 
for [Hawai‘i Rules of Civil Procedure ( HRCP)] Rule 54(b) Certification, Filed 
May 15, 2020, [Dkt. 286] , entered July 10, 2020; and (3) Order Denying 
Defendants'/Counterclaimant's Motion for Attorneys' Fees and Costs (Non -
Hearing Motion Filed September 9, 2020), entered October 26, 2020.

Roland from GI causing damage to Roland; (8) "Squeeze Out" 
Roland from GI causing damage to GI; (9) conspiracy to "Squeeze 
Out" Roland causing damage to Roland; (10) conspiracy to 
"Squeeze Out" Roland causing damage to GI; (11) trade name 
infringement; (12 ) Unfair and Deceptive/Unfair Competition under 
Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) §§ 480 -2 and 481A -3; (13) wanton, 
willful and fraudulent usurpation of corporate opportunity; (14) 
conspiracy to usurp corporate opportunity; and (15) breaches of 
fiduciary dutie s; aiding and abetting the breaches. 
In July 2018, Robert and the business entities 
answered the FAC, and GI filed a counterclaim against Roland. 
GI's counterclaim alleged that Roland, GI's treasurer for 
decades, used corporate funds to pay personal expenses totaling 
more than $800,000. T he counterclaim asserted claims for: (1) 
misappropriation and conversion of corporate funds; (2) breach 
of fiduciary duty; (3) fraud/fraudulent concealment; (4) 
negligence; (5) breach of contract -Bylaws; (6) unjust 
enrichment; (7) judicial removal of Rolan d as director; (8) 
declaratory relief; and (9) injunctive relief. 
In May 2019, Roland moved for partial summary 
judgment, contending that Robert breached his fiduciary duties. 
In June 2019, Robert and the business entities moved for partial 
summary judgment, contending that Roland breached his fiduciary 
duties. The ci rcuit court denied both motions. 
In October 2019, Roland moved for dismissal of GI's 
counterclaims, or in the alternative for summary judgment, 
contending that Robert did not have corporate authority to file 
the counterclaim. The circuit court denied the motion. 
In November 2019, Robert and the business entities 
moved for partial summary judgment on the FAC Counts 4, and 9-
15.   The circuit court granted the motion in part on Counts 4, 
9, 10, 12, 14, and 15, and on Count 13 to the extent it alleged 
4   
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
aiding and abetting. The circuit court reasoned that kinship by 
itself is insufficient to establish a fiduciary relationship, 
and there was no evidence that Robert conspired with anyone to 
harm Roland. The circuit court also concluded that, because GG 
and GI were selling the same product and service , Roland could 
not prevail on his unfair and deceptive trade practices claim 
because he would be unable to establish that GG was "passing off 
goods or services" as being that of GI. The circuit court 
denied summary judgment on the trade name infringement claim. 
Jury trial began on December 16, 2019. 
On December 26, 2019, Robert and the business entities 
moved for JMOL. During argument on the motion, the circuit 
court denied Roland's request to strike GI's counterclaim. The 
circuit court dismissed Roland's claim for punitive damages. 
On December 30, 2019, the jury returned its verdict in 
favor of Roland on the fraudulent non -disclosure claim, and 
awarded him damages of $42,000 against Robert, and $28,000 
against GG. The jury awarded GI damages of $10,000 against 
Robert, and $20,000 ag ainst GG for trade name infringement. The 
jury awarded GI damages of $42,000 against GG for unjust 
enrichment. 
On GI's counterclaim, the jury found that Roland 
breached his fiduciary duties (Count 2) and contractual duties 
arising from the Bylaws (Count 5), and awarded nominal damages 
of $1 on each count. 
The jury denied all other claims. 
In February 2020, Roland filed a Renewed Motion for 
Judgment as a Matter of Law, or Alternatively, to Reconsider, 
Alter or Amend Judgment, and/or Motion for New Trial , and for 
Attorney 's Fees and Costs. Also in February 2020, Robert and 
the business entities filed a Renewed Motion for Judgment as a 
5   
 
 
  
   
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Matter of Law. The circuit court denied both motions in April 
2020. 
In May 2020, Roland moved to dismiss his corporate 
dissolution claim (Count 1 of the FAC), or alternatively for 
[HRCP] Rule 54(b) final judgment certification. The circuit 
court dismissed Count s 1 and 5 of the FAC with prejudice, and 
denied the request for [HRCP] Rule 54(b) certification as moot. 
In July 2020, the circuit court entered findings of 
fact and conclusions of law on the equitable relief requests in 
GI's counterclaim. The circuit court denied the request that 
Roland be removed as GI Director because the jury verdicts in 
Roland's favor o n the fraudulent non -disclosure, trade name 
infringement, and unjust enrichment claims established that 
Robert had unclean hands. Moreover, the circuit court concluded 
that Roland's breaches of fiduciary duty, as found by the jury, 
were caused by animosit y between the brothers, rather than 
"fraudulent or dishonest conduct or gross abuse of authority or 
discretion" directed at GI, and the requests for declaratory and 
injunctive relief were moot. 
Final Judgment was entered on August 26, 2020. In 
September 2020, Robert and the business entities filed a motion 
for attorneys' fees and costs, which the circuit court denied, 
ruling that "[e]ach party shall bear its own attorney's fees and 
costs." 
This appeal and cross -appeal followed.4 
II. Discussion 
A. Roland's Points of Error 
1. GI Counterclaim 
4 On September 29, 2021, this court entered an order remanding the 
case to the circuit court for entry of an amended judgment resolving Count 4 
of the FAC. The circuit court entered a First Amended Final Judgment on 
October 25, 2021. 
6   
 
 
  
 
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Roland contends that the circuit court should have 
granted summary judgment in his favor, by dismissing GI's 
counterclaim, because Robert lacked corporate authorization to 
file the counterclaim in GI's name or should have filed in a 
derivative capacity aft er first making a demand on GI's board of 
directors. Roland's claim lacks merit. 
The record reflects that GI is a closely held 
corporation, and that the only shareholders and officers are 
Robert and Roland. Roland's filing of a lawsuit, seeking the 
dissolution of GI, threatened an immediate and vital injury to 
the corporation. Chun v. Bd.  of Trs. of Emps.' Ret.  Sys., 
87  Hawaiʻi 152, 165, 952 P.2d 1215, 1228 (1998) ("[P]ractical 
necessity has dictated the rule that the president as chief officer of a going concern may[,] even in the face of deadlock[,] take steps to protect corporate interests where immediate and vital injury threatens.")  (citation omitted).   
Under these circumstances, it would have been futile for Robert 
to seek Roland's approval to file a counterclaim against a 
lawsuit that was brought by Roland himself. Fujimoto v. Au, 
95  Hawai‛i 116, 149, 19 P.3d 699, 732 (2001)  (cleaned up)  ("When 
the futility of seeking the desired action from the alleged 
wrongdoers is patent, . . . efforts to obtain action by the directors and shareholders are not necessary, and the allegations of wrongdoing themselves adequately establish the reasons for not making the effort to obtain corporate action.")  
(citation omitted).   We therefore conclude, on this record, that 
the circuit court properly denied Roland's summary judgment motion seeking dismissal of GI's counterclaim.
  5
5 We decline to address Roland's additional argument that there is 
no cause of action for breach of corporate bylaws, an argument that Roland 
did not assert below. HRS § 641 -2(b) (2016) ("The appellate court may 
correct any error appearing on the record, bu t need not consider a point that 
was not presented in the trial court in an appropriate manner.").

2. Breach of Fiduciary Duties 
Roland contends that the circuit court erred in 
granting summary judgment on his claims for breach of fiduciary 
duties based on kinship, conspiracy to breach fiduciary duties, 
and unfair business practices, and for JMOL on his claim for 
punitive damages. We address Roland's contentions as follows: 
(1) We conclude that the circuit court erred in 
granting summary judgment on Roland's claim for breach of 
fiduciary duties based on kinship.  
To claim breach of fiduciary duty, a plaintiff must show 
that a fiduciary relationship existed between the parties, 
the defendant breached a fiduciary duty to the plaintiff, 
and the breach proximately caused injury to the plaintiff. 
A fiduciary relationship exists when there is a 
relationship of trust and confidence. 
Swift v. Swift , No. CAAP -13-0000101, 2016 WL 3573970, at * 33 
(Haw. App. June 30, 2016) (mem. op.) (citations omitted). 
Roland attested below that he "had a very good and 
trusted relationship [with Robert] from way back in 
childhood [,]" that Robert told him that "the 55% -45% division 
would have absolutely no effect on how we ran [GI]" and he 
"completely trusted and believed [Robert], and therefore 
accepted (transacted) a 45% interest in [GI]." Robert and 
Roland started their business in 1985 as a partnership, and 
incorporated in 1991. Roland further attested that Robert later 
used his majority shareholder status to eliminate Roland's 
check-writing authority, reduce his salary, and misappropriate 
GI's King Street shop and other assets. Accepting Roland's 
allegations as true, a jury could find that Robert only acquired 
majority ownership of GI because Roland, on the basis of a 
confidential familial relationship, relied on the 
representations of his brother. We find that Roland satisfied 
his burden of establishing a genuine question of material fact 
regarding breach of fiduciary relations hip based on kinship.

(2) We conclude that the circuit court did not err in 
granting summary judgment on Roland's conspiracy claims.   Roland 
relies on Robert's Hawaii School Bus, Inc. v. Laupahoehoe 
Transp. Co., 91 6
Hawaiʻi,  224, 253, 982 P.2d 853, 882 (1999) 
(citations omitted), superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in Calipjo v. Purdy, 144 Hawai ʻi 266, 277 n. 23,  439 P.3d 
218, 229 n. 23  (2019), for the proposition that "when officers 
of a corporation act for their own personal purposes, they 
become independent actors,  who can conspire with the 
corporation." Roland's reliance on Robert's Hawaii  is 
misplaced, however. There, the court ruled that because a corporate officer shared the same economic interest as the alleged co-conspirator corporations (he was the 94% owner of the corporations' holding company), he could not conspire with the corporations for purposes of HRS §§ 480-4 or 480-9.  Robert's 
Hawaii, 91 Hawaiʻ i at 253, 982 P.2d at 882.   Here, it was 
undisputed that Pacific Welding and GG were owned solely by 
Robert, and "the portion of RSG controlled by Robert"  was the 
portion (i.e., 50%) that he owned. In these circumstances, 
Robert shared the same economic interest as his alleged corporate co-conspirators, and the circuit court did not err by determining as a matter of law that Robert could not conspire with them.  
(3) We conclude that the circuit court erred in 
granting summary judgment with regard to Roland's Unfair or 
Deceptive Acts or Practices ( UDAP) claims. Roland asserted 
claims pursuant to HRS §§ 480 -2 and 481A -3. HRS § 480 -2(a) 
(2008) states that "[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair 
or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or 
6 FAC Counts 9 and 10 asserted conspiracy claims against Robert, 
Pacific Welding, GG, and "that portion of RSG controlled by . . . Robert. " 
FAC Count 14 asserted a conspiracy claim against Robert and GG. 
9

commerce are unlawful." A deceptive act UDAP claim requires the 
plaintiff to prove "(1) a representation, omission, or practice that (2) is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances where (3) the representation, omission, or practice is material." State ex rel. Shikada v. Bristol-Myers  
Squibb  Co., 152 
Hawaiʻi 418, 443, 526 P.3d 395, 420 (2023) 
(citation omitted). An unfair act UDAP claim requires a showing that an act (1) offends public policy, (2) is immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous, or (3) substantially 
injures Hawaiʻ i consumers.  Id.  at 445, 526 P.3d at 422.  
HRS § 481A -3 (2008) states, "[a] person engages in a 
deceptive trade practice when, in the course of the person's 
business . . . the person . . . (3) [c]auses likelihood of 
confusion or of misunderstanding as to affiliation, connection, 
or association with, or certification by, another [.]" HRS 
§ 481A-4(a) allows the court to grant an injunction against a 
deceptive trade practice, which is "in addition to remedies 
otherwise available against the same conduct under the common 
law or other statues of this State." HRS § 481A-4(c). 
The circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of 
Robert on Roland's UDAP claim, reasoning that Roland would not 
be able to establish that GG was "passing off goods or services" 
as GI's because GG and GI were selling the same product. 
However, Robert 's own expert, Eddy N. Kemp, represented in a 
valuation report that "[GG], which does business as Exhaust 
Systems Hawaii Kalihi -Kai, could be viewed as a competitor to 
[GI], which does business as Exhaust Systems Hawaii": 
The [GI] website address is 
https://www.exhaustsystemshawaii.net/ . Reviewing the 
website, it could appear that Exhaust Systems Hawaii and Exhaust Systems Hawaii Kalihi -Kai are one entity as all the 
shops are listed.   There is nothing on the website to 
delineate the two different ownership groups.   In practice, 
if there are services the Kailua or Waipahu shops are 
unable to provide, the work is referred to [GG's] Kalihi -
Kai shop.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On this record, we conclude that the circuit court 
should have allowed Roland's UDAP claim to go to the jury. See 
Hungate v. Law Off . of David B. Rosen , 139 Hawaiʻi 394, 410, 391 
P.3d 1, 17 (2017) , abrogated in part State ex. Rel. Shikada, 152 
Hawai’i  at 445-46, 526 P.3d 1t 422 -23. 
(4) We conclude that the circuit court erred in 
granting JMOL  in favor of Robert on Roland's punitive damages 
claim. We review the circuit court's ruling on JMOL  de novo. 
In re Est.  of Herbert, 90 Hawaiʻi 443, 454, 979 P.2d 39, 50 
(1999). Punitive damages are an extraordinary remedy. Fisher 
v. Grove Farm Co., 123 Hawai ʻi 82, 119, 230 P.3d 382, 419 (Haw. 
App. 2009). Pursuant to Masaki v. Gen.  Motors Corp., 71 Haw. 1, 
6, 780 P.2d 566, 570 (1989), a defendant's wrongdoing must be 
intentional and deliberate and have the character of outrage frequently associated with a crime.  
Roland testified that, in 1985, he left a restaurant 
job to become partners with Robert in a muffler shop business in 
Waipahu. The business incorporated in 1991 as GI, opened 
additional locations in Kailua and on King Street, and did 
business as Exhaust S ystems Hawaii. After 25 years, Robert told 
Roland he was opening a separate business, Pacific Welding, 
which initially operated from GI's Kailua shop before moving to 
GI's Waipahu shop. 
In January 2017, Roland learned that GI no longer 
owned the King Street shop, and that it was owned by GG. Robert 
did not inform him that he was taking the King Street shop for 
GG; Roland learned of the transfer in ownership through parts 
deliveries for GG. Larry Anderson, Roland and Robert's 
bookkeeper, testified that Robert did not notify him that the 
King Street shop was being transferred to GG, and that he 
learned of the transfer after inquiring about the drop in GI's 
revenue. The King Street shop had the largest net income of 
11   
 
 
  
  
  
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
GI's three locations. The jury found in Roland's favor on the 
fraudulent non -disclosure, unjust enrichment, and tradename 
infringement claims. Given the record evidence, the jury should 
have been allowed to consider awarding punitive damages. 
3. Prejudgment Interest 
Roland contends that he should have been awarded 
prejudgment interest because Robert misappropriated the King 
Street shop from  December 31, 2016, and more than three years 
had passed by the time the circuit court entered  Judgment on 
August 26, 2020. The grant or denial of prejudgment interest is 
reviewed for abuse of discretion. Tri-S Corp. v. W.  World Ins. 
Co., 110 Hawaiʻi 473, 489, 135 P.3d 82, 98 (2006).  
HRS § 636-16 authorizes the circuit court, in its 
discretion, to correct injustice when a judgment is delayed for a long period of time for any reason. Metcalf v. Voluntary 
Emps.' Benefit
  Ass'n of Hawai ʻi, 99 Hawaiʻi 53,  61,  52 P.3d 823, 
831  (2002). It is not an abuse of discretion to deny 
prejudgment interest where there is no evidence that the 
defendant's conduct unduly delayed the proceedings or if there 
has been no extraordinary delay in entry of judgment. Amfac, 
Inc. v. Waikiki Beachcomber Inv. Co.,  74 Haw. 85, 137, 839 P.2d 
10, 36 (1992); Page v. Domino's Pizza, Inc., 80 Hawaiʻ i 204, 209, 
908 P.2d 552, 557 (App. 1995). Here, less than three years had passed from the time Roland filed his FAC  on June 19, 2018, and 
the entry of Judgment on August 26, 2020. The record does not reflect that this constituted undue delay or abuse of the 
circuit court's discretion.  
4. Attorneys' Fees and Costs 
Relying on HRS §§ 607 -14 and 414D -90(e), Roland 
requested that the circuit court award him attorney 's fees and 
costs in the amount of $ 204,303.68 – twenty-five percent of his 
$817,214.72  pre-suit demand from Robert – because he 
12   
 
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
successfully defended the counterclaim. On appeal, Roland 
additionally cites HRS § 414 -242, which permits a corporation to 
indemnify directors that are made a party to a lawsuit under 
certain circumstances. The grant or denial of attorneys' fees 
and cost s is reviewed for abuse of discretion. Enoka v. AIG 
Hawaii Ins. Co. , 109 Hawaiʻi 537, 544, 128 P.3d 850, 857 (2006). 
The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in 
denying Roland's claim for fees. The record reflects that 
Roland did not submit an itemized fees request. Counsel stated 
that he was "currently preparing their supporting information 
for an award of attorney's  fees, which is rather voluminous."  
(Underscoring omitted).   Nothing further was submitted. 
"Parties seeking attorneys' fees bear the burden of demonstrating the fees requested are reasonable." Gurrobat v. 
HTH Corp., 135  
Hawaiʻi 128, 135, 346 P.3d 197, 204 (2015). 
Without an itemization, the circuit court did not abuse its 
discretion in denying Roland attorney's fees.  
However, the failure to award Roland costs, without 
explanation, is an abuse of discretion. Wong v. Takeuchi, 
88  Hawaiʻi 46, 52, 961 P.2d 611, 617 (1998), held that reducing 
costs without explanation is  an  abuse of discretion unless the 
reason is plain from the record. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, 
the circuit court did not hold a hearing on Roland's fees and costs request, and its order does not explain the reason for denial. Roland requested $4,335.70 in costs, consisting of $3,229.82 in copying costs,  $31.41 for court reporter 
transcript(s), $515.00 for filing fees, $25.42 for postage, $188.50 for sheriff fees, and $345.55 for video equipment rental. A party requesting an award of costs must provide a receipt of proof of the amount for all outside or third-party 
costs. Tortorello v. Tortorello, 113 Hawai ʻi 432, 444-45, 
153  P.3d 1117, 1129-30 (2007). It appears that the copying

costs and postage were in -house, not outside expenses, and that 
the amounts incurred by Roland were verified through counsel's 
declaration. 
The circuit court erred in denying Roland's motion for 
costs without explanation. 
5. Preferential Dividend 
Roland contends that the circuit court erred in 
denying him a preferential dividend. A preferential dividend is 
an equitable remedy.  
The relief granted by a court in equity is discretionary 
and will not be overturned on review unless the circuit 
court abused its discretion by issuing a decision that 
clearly exceeds the bounds of reason or disregarded rules 
or principles of law or practice to the substantial 
detriment of the appellant. 
Aickin v. Ocean View Invs. Co. , 84 Hawaiʻi 447, 453, 935 P.2d 
992, 998 (1997) (cleaned up). 
On this record, we conclude that Roland fails to 
establish an abuse of discretion by the denial of a preferential 
dividend. The jury found that Roland breached duties owed 
pursuant to the bylaws and as treasurer, and the circuit court 
found that Roland re fused Robert's requests for information and 
the breakdown in communications between the brothers led to the 
lawsuit. Given Roland's own culpability, the circuit court did 
not abuse its discretion in denying him the equitable remedy of 
a preferential divid end. 
B. Robert's Points of Error 
1. Denial of Renewed Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law 
on Roland's Claims 
A trial court's rulings on motions for JMOL are 
reviewed de novo. Est. of Herbert , 90 Hawaiʻi at 454, 979 P.2d 
at50. "Verdicts based on conflicting evidence will not be set 
aside where there is substantial evidence to support the jury's 
findings." Nelson v. Univ. of Hawaii , 97 Hawaiʻi 376, 393, 38 
14   
 
 
  
 
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
P.3d 95, 112 (2001) (citation omitted). We conclude that the 
circuit court was not wrong in denying Robert's motion: 
(1) Robert contends that there is insufficient 
evidence to establish that he  failed to disclose, and profited 
from, the transfer of the King Street shop. To prevail on a 
fraudulent non-disclosure claim, Roland was required to establish by clear and convincing evidence that Robert failed to 
disclose a material fact that justifiably induced Roland to act 
or refrain from acting in a business transaction that resulted 
in damages.   See  Santiago v. Tanaka, 137 
Hawaiʻi 137, 149, 366 
P.3d 612, 624  (2016) (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts § 551 
(Am. Law Inst. 1977)). A party who enters into a contract as a 
result of a fraudulent misrepresentation may have the contract rescinded or seek damages for the fraud. Exotics Hawaii-Kona, 
Inc. v. E.I.  Du Pont De Nemours &  Co., 116 Hawaiʻ i 277, 290-91, 
172 P.3d 1021, 1034-35 (2007). The damages awarded on a fraud 
claim should "put the plaintiff in the position he would have 
been had he not been defrauded." Id.  at 298, 172 P.3d at 1042 
(citation omitted).  
The record reflects that the testimony of Roland and 
Larry Anderson support the breach of fiduciary and punitive 
damages claims. Moreover, the record further reflects that 
Robert prepared and signed a purchase agreement through which 
GI, without Roland's knowledge, purportedly sold the King Street 
shop to GG for $7,260. Robert did not inform Roland of the King 
Street shop transfer. And the day after Roland sent Robert a 
proposal for the dissolution of GI, Robert removed Roland as an 
authorized signatory on GI checks. 
Eddy Kemp, Robert's expert, testified that the King 
Street shop was not performing as well as the other locations. 
However, Robert's tax returns, which were introduced into 
evidence, show that GG reported a loss of $14, 470 in 2016 (the 
15   
 
 
  
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
year prior to the transfer of the King Street shop), followed by 
a profit of $83,658 in 2017, and $4,473 in 2018. Given the 
mixed evidence, we conclude that the jury could choose to credit 
Roland's evidence that Robert benefitted from the undisclosed 
transfer of the King Street shop. 
(2) Robert contends that there was insufficient 
evidence to support the jury's finding that Robert unjustly 
enriched himself at the expense of GI. To prevail on a claim 
for unjust enrichment, the plaintiff must prove that he 
conferred a benefit on the defendant and it would be unjust for 
the defendant to keep the benefit.  See  Durette v. Aloha Plastic 
Recycling, Inc., 105 Hawaiʻi 490, 504, 100 P.3d 60, 74 (2004) 
(citation omitted).  
Robert's contention lacks merit. In addition to the 
evidence suggesting that Robert and GG benefitted from GG's 
acquisition of the King Street shop, Roland introduced evidence 
that GI employees were being used to take delivery of parts for 
GG at GI's Waip ahu shop. Moreover, the record reflects that 
Robert directed that the Kalihi Shop, which was solely owned by 
Robert pursuant to a 2014 settlement, would be included on 
advertisements with Hawaiian Telcom at GI's expense. Robert 
also re-registered to hims elf the tradename "Exhaust Systems 
Hawaii," which had been used by all four shops and had 
originally been registered to GI in December 1994, and demanded 
a license to continue using the trade name at no cost. We 
conclude that the record reflects substanti al evidence for the 
jury to find that GG was unjustly enriched by the use of GI's 
assets. 
(3) Robert and the business entities contend that they 
were entitled to JMOL on the trade name infringement claim 
because the "Exhaust System Hawaii" trade name is generic, there 
was no evidence of customer confusion resulting from the alleged 
16   
 
 
  
  
 
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
infringement, the damages awarded were speculative, and the 
remedy for infringement is a fine and injunctive relief, not 
damages. 
"In Hawaii, the registration and protection of 
trademarks, prints, labels and trade names is governed by HRS 
chapter 482 (1976, as amended)." Carrington v. Sears , Roebuck & 
Co., 5 Haw. App. 194, 19 7-98, 683 P.2d 1220, 1225 (App. 1984). 
To prevail on the trade name infringement claim, Roland needed 
to show that Robert and his business entities used their mark or 
label in a manner likely to confuse consumers. "A likelihood of 
confusion exists when consu mers confronted with products or 
services bearing one label or mark would be likely to assume 
that the source of the products or services is the same as or 
associated with the source of a different product or service 
identified by a similar mark." Id. at 199, 683 P.2d at 1225 -26 
(citation omitted) . Judgment for the defendant may be granted 
only if there is no likelihood of confusion after examining the 
evidence in light of the following factors: (1) similarity of 
the marks; (2) similarity of the goods; (3) relationship between 
the parties' channel s of trade; (4) relationship between the 
parties' advertising; (5) class of prospective purchasers of the 
products; (6) evidence of actual confusion; (7) defendant's 
intent in adopting its mark; and (8) strength of plaintiff's 
mark. Id. at 199-200, 683 P. 2d at 1225-26 (citation omitted). 
The record reflects that Robert registered "Exhaust 
Systems Hawaii" as a trade name for GI in December 1994. Robert 
re-registered the "Exhaust Systems Hawaii" trade name to himself 
in 2019. Roland testified to receiving an invoice from Cutter 
Dodge for t he Kalihi shop, and that he was concerned people 
would not know that GI and GG were two different companies 
because all of the business entities were using "Exhaust Systems 
Hawaii." Moreover, Robert's own expert, Eddy Kemp, acknowledged 
17   
 
 
  
      
 
 
 
  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
based on the company's website that, "it would appear that 
Exhaust Systems Hawaii and Exhaust Systems Hawaii Kalihi Kai are 
one entity , as are all [the] shops are listed. . . . There is 
nothing on the website to delineate the two different ownership 
groups and practice ." On this record, we determine there is 
substantial evidence to support the jury's finding that Robert 
infringed on the "Exhaust Systems Hawaii" trade name. 
We affirm the circuit court's order denying Robert's 
Renewed Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law. 
2. Withdrawal of Corporate Dissolution Claim 
We conclude that the circuit court did not err in 
allowing Roland to withdraw his claim for corporate dissolution 
of GI. A court should deny a motion for voluntary dismissal if the defendant will be seriously prejudiced, taking into account the expense and inconvenience to the defendant. Tagupa v. 
VIPDesk, 135 
Hawaiʻi 468, 475, 353 P.3d 1010, 1017  (2015) 
(citations omitted). Alternatively, if the defendant will be 
prejudiced, the court may impose terms and conditions on the 
dismissal, to ensure that substantial justice is accorded to 
both parties, which may include requiring the plaintiff to pay 
the defendant's fees and costs or other conditions. Id.  at 476-
77, 353 P.3d at 1018-19  (citations omitted).  
In moving for dismissal of his claim for dissolution, 
Roland claimed financial hardship, which was worsened by the 
Covid-19 pandemic, and expressed his desire to wait on 
dissolution for values to stabilize. Robert contended that he 
had already endured three years of litigation, would be 
prejudiced by additional delays, and, alternatively, that 
dismissal should be with prejudic e with Roland ordered to pay a 
reasonable portion of fees and costs. On appeal, Robert 
additionally contends that the circuit cou rt, by granting the 
18   
 
 
     
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
dismissal, required him to remain in a business relationship 
that both he and Roland agree should end.7 
On this record, we conclude that the circuit court did 
not abuse its discretion in granting Roland's request to 
withdraw his corporate dissolution claim without prejudice. In 
its ruling, the circuit court expressly noted its concern 
regarding the impact t hat dissolution would have "in the current 
economic situation," not only on Roland and Robert, but on 
company employees. Two GI employees who had testified during 
trial voiced concerns about retaining their jobs. 
We affirm the circuit court's order allowing Roland to 
withdraw his corporate dissolution claim. 
3. Attorneys' Fees and Costs 
The grant or denial of attorneys' fees and costs is 
reviewed for abuse of discretion. Enoka, 109 Hawaiʻi at  544, 
128  P.3d at  857. We conclude that the circuit court did not err 
in denying Robert and the business entities' request for 
attorneys' fees and costs.  
Robert claims that he was entitled to an award of 
attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to HRS §§ 607 -148 and 414-
7 We note that Robert did not include a claim for corporate 
dissolution in his counterclaim. 
8 HRS § 607 -14 (2016), which authorizes attorneys' fees in actions 
in the nature of assumpsit, etc., provides, in relevant part, 
In all the courts, in all actions in the nature of 
assumpsit and in all actions on a promissory note or other 
contract in writing that provides for an attorney's fee, 
there shall be taxed as attorneys' fees, to be paid by the 
losing party and to be include d in the sum for which 
execution may issue, a fee that the court determines to be 
reasonable; provided that the attorney representing the 
prevailing party shall submit to the court an affidavit 
stating the amount of time the attorney spent on the action 
and the amount of time the attorney is likely to spend to 
obtain a final written judgment, or, if the fee is not 
based on an hourly rate, the amount of the agreed upon fee. 
The court shall th en tax attorneys' fees, which the court 
(continued . . .)

177(2) and (3).   Robert claims that he was the prevailing party 
because Roland recovered on only three of the fifteen claims in 
the FAC, and was awarded damages of only $142,000  even though he 
claimed damages of $9 million during discovery. Robert also claims that he prevailed on his counterclaim because the circuit court and the jury agreed that Roland breached his fiduciary duties.  9
The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in 
denying Robert's and the business entities' fees motion because 
Roland  was the prevailing party. We affirm the circuit court's 
order denying Robert's motion for attorney's fees.  
III. Conclusion 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the Judgment in 
part, and remand for (1) trial on Roland's claims of breach of 
fiduciary duty based on kinship, UDAP, and punitive damages claims, and determination of damages, if any, (2) consideration 
determines to be reasonable, to be paid by the losing 
party; provided that this amount shall not exceed twenty -
five per cent of the judgment. 
9 HRS § 414 -177 (2004) authorizes that a court "may" require payment 
of attorneys' fees upon the termination of a derivative proceeding: 
§414-177 Payment of expenses. On termination of the 
derivative proceeding the court may: 
  . . . . 
(2) Order the plaintiff to pay any defendant's reasonable 
expenses (including counsel fees) incurred in 
defending the proceeding if it finds that the 
proceeding was commenced or maintained with out 
reasonable cause or for an improper purpose; or 
(3) Order a party to pay an opposing party's reasonable 
expenses (including counsel fees) incurred because of 
the filing of a pleading, motion, or other paper, if 
it finds that the pleading, motion, or other paper 
was not well -grounded in fact, after reasonable 
inquiry, or warr anted by existing law or a good faith 
argument for the extension, modificatio n, or reversal 
of existing law and was interposed for an improper 
purpose, such as to harass or cause unnecessary delay 
or needless increase in the cost of litigation.
