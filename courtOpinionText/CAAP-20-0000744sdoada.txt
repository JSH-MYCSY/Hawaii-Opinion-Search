APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 3CC061000228)  
 
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: 
Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and McCullen, JJ.) 
Plaintiff-Appellants Thomas Frank Schmidt and Lorinna 
Jhincil Schmidt (Schmidts) appeal from the Circuit Court of the 
Third Circuit's  (1) November 12, 2020 Findings of Fact, 
Conclusions of Law, and Order Granting Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (Order Granting Summary Judgment), and 1
1 The Honorable Henry T. Nakamoto presided.  
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2) November 12, 2020 order denying the Schmidts' motion to 
amend and correct the Order Granting Summary Judgment "to 
Conform to the [Hawai‘ i] Supreme Court Decision Dated November 8, 
2019, Filed in this Court on December 4, 2019 as Document No. 169, and the December 3, 2019 [Hawaiʻ i] Supreme Court 
Judgment on Appeal, as Document No. 171, Filed February 14, 2020 
[Dkt 173]" (Order Denying Motion to Amend). 
On appeal, the Schmidts contend the circuit court 
erred in concluding they were unable to pursue a claim under 
Hawai‘i Revised Statutes (HRS) Chapter 651C, also known as the 
Hawai‘i Uniform Fraudulent Transfers Act (HUFTA), once their 
judgment against original debtor Realty Finance, Inc. (RFI) 
expired. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve the 
points of error as discussed below, and affirm. 
The background underlying this case spans over 20 
years and includes three appeals. Briefly, RFI was a wholly 
owned subsidiary of HSC, Inc. Richard and Eleanor Henderson 
(Hendersons) were officers and directors of HSC. Richard and family members owned 70 percent of HSC. 
RFI obtained a foreclosure judgment against the 
Schmidts. In 2000, after receiving the foreclosure sale 
2  
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
proceeds, RFI transferred funds to the Hendersons, and 
transferred funds to a law firm to satisfy an HSC debt. Following the transfers, RFI became insolvent. 
In 2004, judgment was entered in favor of the Schmidts 
and against RFI for "$537,258.66, constituting the surplus of the foreclosure sale proceeds" (2004 Judgment). In 2006, the Schmidts filed a first amended complaint (2006 Complaint) against HSC and the Hendersons claiming "RFI removed or concealed assets and thereby became insolvent shortly after the transfers were made and shortly after RFI received the mortgage sale proceeds from" the Schmidts. In the 2006 Complaint, the Schmidts relied on the 2004 Judgment to establish they were 
creditors of RFI. 
Multiple appeals occurred. 
In the third appeal, the 
Hawai‘i Supreme Court determined the Schmidts timely raised their 
HUFTA claims, and remanded the case to the circuit court. 
Schmidt v. HSC, Inc.
, 145 Hawaiʻi 351, 362, 452 P.3d 348, 359 
(2019). On remand, the circuit court issued its Order Granting Summary Judgment, ruling the Schmidts were barred from pursuing 
their HUFTA claim because "[t]he 2004 Judgment was the only basis on which the Schmidts claimed to be creditors of RFI" and the Schmidts "are no longer 'creditors' of RFI as their 2004 Judgment was not extended, and therefore, expired as a matter of law under HRS § 657-5."

Here, before this court, the Schmidts raise seven 
points of error,2 which we consolidate for discussion as 
2 The Schmidts' seven points of error are as follows: 
1. "The trial court committed reversible error granting HSC and
Henderson's 12 June 2020 motion for summary judgment that Schmidts' UFTA claim was no longer valid as their judgment
against the transferor RFI expired, thereby terminating theirUFTA claim"; 
2. "The trial court committed reversible error refusing to follow 
[Hawaiʻi] Supreme Court decision in 
 Schmidt v. HSC, Inc., 145 Haw. 
351, 452 P.3d 348 (2019) (Schmidt III) in which the case was 
remanded for the second time, holding that the Schmidts' UFTAclaim was not barred by the one[-] year statute of limitations"; 
3. "The trial court committed reversible error denying Schmidts'14 February 2020 motion to amend and correct the 19 October 2016 
FOF, COL, order and judgment to conform with the 
[Hawaiʻi] Supreme 
Court decision in Schmidt III"; 
4. "The trial court committed reversible error in FOF No. 3 on 12 
November 2020 in 20 ROA 22 at pages 2- 3"; 
5. "The trial court committed reversible error in COL Nos. 1, 2- 4 
and 5 when it filed the FOF, COL and order granting Defendants' 
motion for summary judgment on 12 November 2020"; 
6. "The trial court committed reversible error in filing the
12 November 2020 order granting the Defendants HSC and
Henderson's motion for summary judgment which appears in 20 ROA 
222 @ page 4 and which appears also in Appendix 1 incorporatedherein by reference as if fully set forth herein"; and 
7. "The trial court committed reversible error filing the Final
Judgment on 5 March 2021, a copy of which is appended in Appendix 
11." 
(Some emphasis omitted.) The Schmidts do not raise specific arguments
regarding their challenge to findings of fact (FOF) 3 and conclusions of law 
(COL) 1-5.  Nonetheless, based on our decision below, FOF 3 was not clearly 
erroneous and COL 1- 5 were not wrong. 
In the argument section of their opening brief, the Schmidts discuss 
due process and equal protection violations. 
The Schmidts, however, do not 
raise these issues in their points of error or cite to where in the record 
they raised these issues before the circuit court. Hawaiʻi Rules of A ppellate 
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4). Thus, we deem these issues waived. HRAP 
Rule 28(b)(4);

, 112 Hawai‘i 374, 387, 146 P.3d 89, 102 (2006)

sift through a voluminous record" where appellant fails to provide citationsto the record).

asserting (1) the circuit court erred in determining their HUFTA 
claim was no longer valid, and (2) the law of the case doctrine rendered the Order Granting Summary Judgment moot. 
(1) The Schmidts contend the circuit court erred in 
determining their HUFTA claim was not viable because a judgment is not required to pursue a HUFTA claim. Although a judgment is not required to pursue a HUFTA claim, under HRS § 651C-7 (2016), being a creditor is. 
HUFTA's relief provision, HRS § 651C-7, allows a 
creditor to seek relief from transfers of funds to satisfy a claim: 
(a) In any action for relief against a transfer or 
obligation under this chapter, a creditor, subject to the
limitations provided in section 651C- 8, may obtain: 
(1) Avoidance of the transfer or obligation to the 
extent necessary to satisfy the creditor's claim; 
 . . . . 
(b) If a creditor has obtained a judgment on a claim
against the debtor, the creditor may, if the court so orders, levy execution on the asset transferred or its proceeds. 
(Emphases added and formatting altered.) A creditor is defined 
as "a person who has a claim against a debtor." HRS § 651C-1 (2016). 
Again, the Schmidts relied on the 2004 Judgment in 
their 2006 Complaint to establish they were creditors of RFI, i.e., had a claim against RFI. The Schmidts, however, did not seek to extend the 2004 Judgment and, thus, the 2004 Judgment 
5

expired in 2014. HRS § 657-5 (2016).3 An expired judgment is 
presumed "paid and discharged." Id.; Realty Fin., Inc. v.
Schmidt, 104 Hawai‘ i 191, 86 P.3d 1000, No. 23441, 2004 WL 
541878, at *6, (Haw. Mar. 18, 2004) (mem. op.) (citing 
Restatement (Second) Judgments § 18 cmt. a (2003)) (noting "[w]hen the plaintiff recovers a valid and final personal judgment, his original claim is extinguished and rights upon the 
judgment are substituted for it"). 
In 2016, the circuit court entered an order deeming 
the 2004 Judgment discharged. In its order, the circuit court 
stated the 2004 Judgment "was entered more than ten years ago, and no extension of the 2004 Judgment was sought by [the Schmidts]. Under HRS § 657-5, the 2004 Judgment, with all the rights and remedies appurtenant thereto, is conclusively deemed 
3 HRS § 657- 5 provides a judgment is presumed paid and discharged after
10 years unless an extension of the judgment was granted: 
Domestic judgments and decrees. Unless an extension is 
granted, every judgment and decree of any court of the
State shall be presumed to be paid and discharged at the 
expiration of ten years after the judgment or decree was rendered. No action shall be commenced after the 
expiration of ten years from the date a judgment or decree was rendered or extended. No extension of a judgment ordecree shall be granted unless the extension is sought
within ten years of the date of the original judgment or 
decree was rendered. A court shall not extend any judgmentof decree beyond twenty years from the date of the original judgment or decree. No extension shall be granted withoutnotice and the filing of a non- hearing motion or a hearing 
motion to extend the life of the judgment or decree. 
(Emphasis added.)

paid and discharged" citing Int'l Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. Wiig, 82 
Hawai‘i 197, 199, 921 P.2d 117, 119 (1996). 
Once the 2004 Judgment was considered discharged, the 
Schmidts lost their status as creditors of RFI. And the 
Schmidts did not show there was another basis for being creditors of RFI. Because the Schmidts were no longer creditors of RFI, they could not sustain their HUFTA claim in the 2006 
Complaint. 
Thus, the circuit court did not err in granting 
summary judgment. 
(2) Next, the Schmidts contend the circuit court 
erred in determining their HUFTA claim was not viable because 
the law of the case rendered the "very tardy motion for summary 
judgment under [Hawai‘ i Rules of Civil Procedure] Rule 56 moot." 
Contrary to the Schmidts' argument, the law of the case doctrine 
does not render the Order Granting Summary Judgment moot. 
Pursuant to the law of the case doctrine, "a 
determination of a question of law made by an appellate court 
. . . may not be disputed by a reopening of the question at a 
later stage of [the] litigation." Hussey v. Say
, 139 Hawai‘i 
181, 186, 384 P.3d 1282, 1287 (2016) (quoting 
Tabieros v. Clark 
Equip. Co.
, 85 Hawaiʻi 336, 352 n.8, 944 P.2d 1279, 1295 n.8 
(1997)).

Here, the issue of whether the Schmidts' HUFTA claim 
remained viable once the 2004 Judgment expired was not 
previously addressed, and the Hawai‘ i Supreme Court specifically 
declined to address this issue in the third appeal. Schmidt
, 
145 Hawai‘i at 360, 452 P.3d at 357. 
Thus, contrary to the Schmidts' argument, the law of 
the case doctrine did not render the Order Granting Summary 
Judgment moot. 
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the November 12, 
2020 Order Granting Summary Judgment and November 12, 2020 Order 
Denying Motion to Amend.
