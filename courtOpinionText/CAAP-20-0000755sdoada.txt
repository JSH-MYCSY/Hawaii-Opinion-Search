JOHNNY TORRES, also known as Johnny J. Torres

APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1FFC-20-0000768) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Ginoza, C.J., and Leonard and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Johnny Torres, also known as Johnny 
J. Torres and/or Johnny Torres, Jr. (Torres), appeals from the 
Judgment of Conviction and Sentence; Notice of Entry (Judgment), 
entered on December 4, 2020, in the Family Court of the First 
Circuit (Family Court).1/ Following a bench trial, Torres was

On appeal, Torres contends that the Family Court 
violated his constitutional right to testify by failing to 
conduct a proper pre-trial advisement under State v. Lewis
, 94 
Hawai# i 292, 12 P.3d 1233 (2000), and a proper ultimate colloquy 
under 
Tachibana v. State
, 79 Hawai# i 226, 900 P.2d 1293 (1995).  
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve Torres's contentions as follows, and vacate the Judgment. 
Torres contends that the pretrial advisement under 
Lewis
 and the ultimate colloquy under Tachibana were deficient 
because the Family Court failed to engage Torres in a true colloquy to ensure he understood his right to testify.  
The State concedes that the Family Court erred in 
failing to conduct adequate Lewis and Tachibana colloquies, and does not contend that the error was harmless.  Although we are not bound by it, we must also "give due consideration" to the State's concession of error, as "[a] prosecutor's confession, although not binding on an appellate court, is 'entitled to great weight.'"  State v. Eduwensuyi
, 141 Hawai# i 328, 337, 409 P.3d 
732, 741 (2018) (quoting 
Territory v. Kogami, 37 Haw. 174, 175 
(Haw. Terr. 1945)). 
The validity of a defendant's waiver of the right to 
testify in a criminal case is a question of constitutional law

(b) If the person who the police officer reasonably
believes to have inflicted the abuse is eighteen

premises for a period of separation, during
which time the person shall not initiate anycontact, either by telephone or in person, withthe family or household member. . . 
. . . . 
(e) If the person so ordered . . . returns to the
premises before the expiration of the period of
separation . . . , the person shall be placedunder arrest for the purpose of preventingfurther physical abuse or harm to the family orhousehold member[.]

reviewed by this court under the right/wrong standard.  State v. 
Celestine, 142 Hawai# i 165, 169, 415 P.3d 907, 911 (2018).  In 
State v. Martin, 146 Hawai# i 365, 463 P.3d 1022 (2020), the 
Hawai# i Supreme Court summarized the relevant case law as 
follows: 
Our law protects both the right to testify and the
right not to testify.  State v. Celestine, 142 Hawai i # 165, 
169, 415 P.3d 907, 911 (2018).  Tachibana v. State, 79 
Hawai #i 226, 900 P.2d 1293 (1995), established the
requirement that when a defendant in a criminal caseindicates an intention not to testify, the trial court mustadvise the defendant of the right to testify and must obtainan on-the-record waiver of the right.  79 Hawai i # at 236, 
900 P.2d at 1303.  We stated that this advisement should 
consist of informing the defendant (1) that they have a
right to testify, (2) that if they want to testify, no onecan prevent them from doing so, and (3) that if theytestify, the prosecution will be allowed to cross-examinethem.  79 Hawai #i at 236 n.7, 900 P.2d at 1303 n.7.  We also 
stated that in connection with the privilege againstself-incrimination, the defendant should also be advised (4)that they have a right not to testify and (5) that if theydo not testify, then the jury can be instructed about thatright.  Id. (citations omitted).  In a bench trial,defendants must be advised that if they exercise their rightnot to testify, no inference of guilt may be drawn forexercising this right, i.e., that a decision not to testifycannot be used against a defendant by the judge in deciding
the case.  State v. Monteil, 134 Hawai #i 361, 371-72, 341 
P.3d 567, 577-78 (2014). 
After Tachibana, we also held that a second component
of the Tachibana colloquy involves the court engaging in a
true "colloquy" with the defendant.  Celestine, 142 
Hawai #i 
at 170, 415 P.3d at 912, citing State v. Han, 130 Hawai #i 
83, 90-91, 306 P.3d 128, 135-36 (2013).  This requires "averbal exchange between the judge and the defendant 'inwhich the judge ascertains the defendant's understanding ofthe proceedings and of the defendant's rights.'"  Celestine, 142 Hawai i # at 170, 415 P.3d at 912 (citing Han, 130 Hawai i #
at 90, 306 P.3d at 135 (emphasis omitted)). 
. . . . 
A defendant's right to testify is violated when the
colloquy does not establish "an objective basis for finding
that the defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarilygave up" their right to testify.  Han, 130 
Hawai i # at 91, 
306 P.3d at 136.  Courts look to the totality of the factsand circumstances to determine whether a waiver of the rightto testify was voluntarily and intelligently made.  130 Hawai #i at 89, 306 P.3d at 134. 
Id. at 378-79, 463 P.3d at 1035-36 (footnotes and brackets 
omitted). 
Additionally, in Lewis, the supreme court adopted a 
prospective requirement that, "prior to the start of trial, trial courts must '(1) inform the defendant of his or her personal 
3   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
right to testify or not to testify and (2) alert the defendant 
that if he or she has not testified by the end of the trial, the court will briefly question the defendant to ensure that the decision not to testify is the defendant's own decision.'" Monteil, 134 
Hawai# i at 371, 341 P.3d at 577 (quoting Lewis, 94 
Hawai# i at 297, 12 P.3d at 1238). 
We find dispositive Torres's contention that the Family 
Court failed to conduct a proper ultimate colloquy under Tachibana
.  In particular, the Family Court failed to engage 
Torres in a "true colloquy" before the defense rested.3/  Martin, 
3/ After the State rested, the Family Court advised Torres as 
follows: 
THE COURT:  . . . .  
. . . Mr. Torres[,] . . . you have a constitutional
right to testify in your own defense. 
Although you should talk with your attorney before
deciding whether or not to testify, it is your personal
right and no one can prevent you from testifying should you
choose to do so.  But if you do choose to testify, you have
to know the prosecutor can ask you questions about yourtestimony on cross-examination. 
You also have a constitutional right to remain silent
and not to testify.  If you choose not to testify, I can'thold this against you in any way in deciding the case. 
So we're at that point in the trial where I'm
questioning you whether you want to testify or not, and ifyou wanna talk with your attorney, you can do that too.  I'm not trying to rush you.  But you just have to be aware ofthe colloquy, the questions.  Okay? 
Do you need to talk to [Defense Counsel]? 
THE DEFENDANT:  Yes, ma'am, Your Honor. THE COURT:  Okay. . . . [Two-minute recess taken.] . . . . THE COURT:  All right.  Please be seated.  So, [Defense Counsel], what is your client going to 
do? 
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  Judge, he would exercise his right 
to remain silent. 
THE COURT:  Okay.  So, Mr. Torres, this is your 
choice, correct?

146 Hawai# i at 378, 463 P.3d at 1035 (citing Celestine, 142 
Hawai# i at 170, 415 P.3d at 912).  Although the Family Court 
advised Torres regarding his rights to testify and not to 
testify, it failed to engage him in a verbal exchange to ascertain his understanding of the proceedings and of his rights. See id.
"Once a violation of the constitutional right to 
testify is established, the conviction must be vacated unless the State can prove that the violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt."  Tachibana, 79 
Hawai# i at 240, 900 P.2d at 
1307.  Here, the State does not contend, and we cannot conclude, that the violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  See State v. Hoang, 94 Hawai# i 271, 279, 12 P.3d 371, 379 (App. 2000) 
("In general, it is inherently difficult, if not impossible, to divine what effect a violation of the defendant's constitutional right to testify had on the outcome of any particular case."). 
For these reasons, we vacate the Judgment of Conviction 
and Sentence; Notice of Entry, entered on December 4, 2020, in 
3/  (...continued)
THE DEFENDANT:  Yes, ma'am. 
THE COURT:  And nobody's forcing you one way or 
another? 
THE DEFENDANT:  Yes, ma'am. THE COURT:  And your mind is clear? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma'am. 
THE COURT:  Okay.  Very good. All right. [DEPUTY PROSECUTING ATTORNEY]:  Your Honor, I'm sorry. 
. . .  [A]ren't there a couple more questions in the
Tachibana colloquy? 
THE COURT:  A couple more questions? 
Okay.  Is this your personal decision, Mr. Torres? 
Not to testify, is that correct? THE DEFENDANT:  Yes, ma'am, Your Honor. THE COURT:  Okay.  And is anybody forcing you,
threatening you, coercing you, or pressuring you not to
testify? 
THE DEFENDANT:  No, ma'am, Your Honor.
