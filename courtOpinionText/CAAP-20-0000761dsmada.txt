IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I  
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
BRIAN BOBROFF, Defendant-Appellant. 
A
PPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
LÎHU# E DIVISION 
(CASE NO. 5DCW-20-0001083) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: 
Leonard, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and McCullen, JJ.) 
Self-represented Defendant-Appellant Brian Bobroff 
(Bobroff
) appeals from the District Court of the Fifth Circuit, 
Lîhu# e Division's1 November 18, 2020 "Judgment Re: Bail/Bond 
Forfeiture" (November 18, 2020 Judgment). This court, however, 
lacks jurisdiction over this appeal. 
The district court entered the November 18, 2020 
Judgment in favor of the State and against Bobroff, forfeiting 
Bobroff's bail for failure to appear. 
Six days later, on 
November 24, 2020, Bobroff filed an "Affidavit of November 17th 2020," (Affidavit) which stated, "On November 17th 2020 I 
attempted to schedule a flight the day before my arraignment 
(11/18/2020), in the Fifth Circuit Court with Southwest

Airlines[,]" "an employee of Southwest who stated that I must 
agree to wear a medical device over my nose and mouth as a condition of flying[,]" and "I was prevented from attending my arraignment because I refused to undertake a medical intervention without informed consent and without the supervision of a physician or judicial review." 
On December 15, 2020, Bobroff filed a notice of appeal 
from the November 18, 2020 Judgment. 
On January 12, 2021, the district court entered the 
Judgment/Order and Notice of Entry of Judgment/Order (January 12, 
2021 Order) without the signature of a judge or court clerk. The January 12, 2021 Court Minutes state, "No motion to set aside 
bail forfeiture filed; the Court [] forfeited bail ($100.00 #500033506 posted by Self)[.]" Because the January 12, 2021 Order was unsigned, it had no effect, including its execution on the November 18, 2020 Judgment and its determination that no motion to set aside was filed.

Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 804-51 (2014) provides, 
in relevant part, as follows: 
Whenever the court, in any criminal cause, forfeits any bond
or recognizance given in a criminal cause, the court shallimmediately enter up judgment in favor of the State andagainst the principal or principals and surety or sureties 
2 Deutsche Bank Nat'l Trust Co. v. Greenspon , 143 Hawai #i 237, 247 &
n.27, 428 P.3d 749, 759 & n.27 (2018) (explaining that a file stamp signed bythe clerk is inadequate to fulfill the requirements of entry of a judgment orappealable order); Rules of the District Courts of the State of 
Hawai #i 
Rule 2(e) provides as follows: 
Any order or judgement that is filed electronically bearinga facsimile signature in lieu of an original signature of ajudge or clerk has the same force and effect as if the judgeor clerk had affixed the judge's or clerk's signature to apaper copy of the order or judgment and it had been enteredon the docket in a conventional manner. For purposes of
this rule and any rules of court, the facsimile signaturemay be either an image of a handwritten signature or thesoftware printed name of the judge preceded by /s/.

on the bond, jointly and severally, for the full amount of
the penalty thereof, and shall cause execution to issuethereon immediately after the expiration of thirty days fromthe date that notice is given via personal service orcertified mail, return receipt requested, to the surety orsureties on the bond, of the entry of the judgment in favorof the State, unless before the expiration of thirty daysfrom the date that notice is given to the surety or suretieson the bond of the entry of the judgment in favor of theState, a motion or application of the principal orprincipals, surety or sureties, or any of them, showing goodcause why execution should not issue upon the judgment, isfiled with the court. If the motion or application, after ahearing held thereon, is sustained, the court shall vacatethe judgment of forfeiture and, if the principal surrendersor is surrendered pursuant to section 804-14 or section804-41, return the bond or recognizance to the principal orsurety, whoever shall have given it, less the amount of anycost, as established at the hearing, incurred by the Stateas a result of the nonappearance of the principal or otherevent on the basis of which the court forfeited the bond or recognizance. If the motion or application, after a hearingheld thereon, is overruled, execution shall forthwith issueand shall not be stayed unless the order overruling themotion or application is appealed from as in the case of afinal judgment. 
(Emphases added.) 
As the Hawai# i Supreme Court has before explained, a 
condition precedent to appeal from a judgment of forfeiture is 
the filing of a motion to set aside within thirty days from the judgment showing good cause why execution should not issue upon the judgment. State v. Camara, 81 Hawai# i 324, 329, 916 P.2d 
1225, 1230 (1996). A defendant may attempt to show good cause by "providing a satisfactory reason for his or her failure to appear when required[.]" Id. at 330, 916 P.2d at 1231. Thus, "the 
appealable event is the order denying the motion to set aside the judgment of forfeiture." Id. at 329, 916 P.2d at 1230.
 Here, the November 18, 2020 Judgment, which was a 
judgment of forfeiture, was not appealable because it did not grant or deny a motion to set aside the judgment of forfeiture. Six days after the November 18, 2020 Judgment was entered, Bobroff filed his Affidavit, which we construe as a "motion or application of the principal . . . showing good cause" why the 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
judgment should not be executed under HRS § 804-51. See Erum v. 
Llego, 147 Hawai# i 368, 380-81, 465 P.3d 815, 827-28 (2020) 
(stating that to promote access to justice, pleadings prepared by 
self-represented litigants should be interpreted liberally). With the January 12, 2021 Order having no effect and the Affidavit being undecided, the record does not indicate that the district court concluded the proceedings below. See HRS § 804-
51. 
Therefore, we dismiss this appeal for lack of appellate 
jurisdiction.
