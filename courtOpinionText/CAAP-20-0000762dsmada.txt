IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
STEPHANIE Y. LIN, Defendant-Appellant. 
A
PPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
LÎHU# E DIVISION 
(CASE NO. 5DCW-20-0001086) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By:  Leonard, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
Self-represented Defendant-Appellant Stephanie Y. Lin 
(Lin
) appeals from the District Court of the Fifth Circuit, 
Lîhu# e Division's1 November 18, 2020 "Judgment Re: Bail/Bond 
Forfeiture" (November 18, 2020 Judgment).  This court, however, 
lacks jurisdiction over this appeal. 
On November 18, 2020, the State filed a "Verified 
Application to Revoke Bail, Recognizance, Supervised Release, or 
Release on Own Recognizance."  Later that day, the district court entered its November 18, 2020 Judgment in favor of the State and against Lin, forfeiting her bail for failure to appear. 
On November 24, 2020, Lin filed an "Affidavit of 
November 17th 2020" (
Affidavit) that stated, "On November 17th 
1  The Honorable Michael K. Soong presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2020 I attempted to schedule a flight the day before my 
arraignment (11/18/2020), in the Fifth Circuit Court with Southwest Airlines[,]" "an employee of Southwest who stated that I must agree to wear a medical device over my nose and mouth as a condition of flying[,]" and "I was prevented from attending my arraignment because I refused to undertake a medical intervention without informed consent and without the supervision of a physician or judicial review." 
On December 15, 2020, Lin filed a notice of appeal from 
the November 18, 2020 Judgment. 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 804-51 (2014) provides, 
in relevant part, as follows: 
Whenever the court, in any criminal cause, forfeits any bond
or recognizance given in a criminal cause, the court shallimmediately enter up judgment in favor of the State andagainst the principal or principals and surety or suretieson the bond, jointly and severally, for the full amount ofthe penalty thereof, and shall cause execution to issuethereon immediately after the expiration of thirty days fromthe date that notice is given via personal service orcertified mail, return receipt requested, to the surety orsureties on the bond, of the entry of the judgment in favorof the State, unless before the expiration of thirty daysfrom the date that notice is given to the surety or suretieson the bond of the entry of the judgment in favor of theState, a motion or application of the principal orprincipals, surety or sureties, or any of them, showing goodcause why execution should not issue upon the judgment, isfiled with the court.  If the motion or application, after ahearing held thereon, is sustained, the court shall vacatethe judgment of forfeiture and, if the principal surrendersor is surrendered pursuant to section 804-14 or section804-41, return the bond or recognizance to the principal orsurety, whoever shall have given it, less the amount of anycost, as established at the hearing, incurred by the Stateas a result of the nonappearance of the principal or otherevent on the basis of which the court forfeited the bond or recognizance.  If the motion or application, after a hearingheld thereon, is overruled, execution shall forthwith issueand shall not be stayed unless the order overruling themotion or application is appealed from as in the case of afinal judgment. 
(Emphases added.) 
As the Hawai# i Supreme Court has before explained, a 
condition precedent to appeal from a judgment of forfeiture is 
the filing of a motion to set aside within thirty days from the 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
judgment showing good cause why execution should not issue upon 
the judgment.  State v. Camara
, 81 Hawai# i 324, 329, 916 P.2d 
1225, 1230 (1996).  A defendant may attempt to show good cause by "providing a satisfactory reason for his or her failure to appear when required[.]"  
Id. at 330, 916 P.2d at 1231.  Thus, "the 
appealable event is the order denying the motion to set aside the judgment of forfeiture."  Id. at 329, 916 P.2d at 1230. 
Here, the November 18, 2020 Judgment, which was a 
judgment of forfeiture, was not appealable because it did not grant or deny a motion to set aside the judgment of forfeiture. And the proof of service reflects that Lin received notice of the November 18, 2020 Judgment via certified mail on November 24, 2020.  That same day, November 24, 2020, Lin filed her Affidavit, which we construe as a "motion or application of the principal . . . showing good cause" why the judgment should not be executed under HRS § 804-51.  See Erum v. Llego
, 147 Hawai# i 368, 380-81, 
465 P.3d 815, 827-28 (2020) (stating that to promote access to justice, pleadings prepared by self-represented litigants should be interpreted liberally).  Before any hearing on Lin's Affidavit or any conclusion to the proceedings below, Lin filed her December 15, 2020 Notice of Appeal to this court. 
Therefore, we dismiss this appeal for lack of appellate 
jurisdiction.
