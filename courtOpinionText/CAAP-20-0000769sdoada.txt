On appeal, Husband challenges the family court's 
decision to: (1) have each party start paying retirement 
benefits owed to the other when both parties retire; (2) use   
June 14, 1995 as Wife's employment start date; (3) use the date

Husband's points of error as discussed below, and vacate and 
remand in part and affirm in part. 
"[T]he family court possesses wide discretion in 
making its decisions and those decisions will not be set aside 
unless there is a manifest abuse of discretion." Kakinami v.
Kakinami
, 127 Hawaiʻi 126, 136, 276 P.3d 695, 705 (2012). Its 
findings of fact are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard, while its conclusions of law are reviewed de novo 
under the right/wrong standard. 
Id.A conclusion of law 
presenting mixed questions of fact and law is reviewed under the 
clearly erroneous standard. KS v. RS
, 151 Hawaiʻi 336, 341, 512 
P.3d 702, 707 (App. 2022). 
(1) Husband contends the family court "erred in 
ruling that the division of each party's State of [Hawaiʻ i] ERS 
(Employees Retirement System) Hybrid Retirement Plan does not 
become effective unless and until both parties retire from their 
employment with the State of [ Hawaiʻi.]" Husband argues the 
family court's ruling was contrary to "established law" 
requiring payments to start when a party begins receiving retirement benefits. Contrary to Husband's contention, the family court did not abuse its discretion.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The general rule is that a party should start payments 
of a Linson share to a former spouse once that party begins 
receiving the retirement benefit.  Cassiday v. Cassiday, 68 Haw. 
383, 384 n.1, 716 P.2d 1133, 1135 n.1 (1986). 
However, Hawai‘ i 
courts have also ruled a party may be required, for equitable reasons, to pay their Linson share of a retirement benefit before the party has retired and begun receiving it. See Green
v. Green, 1 Haw. App. 599, 600, 623 P.2d 890, 891 (1981) 
(providing family court justified in requiring husband to pay former wife a portion of retirement benefit, even though he had not yet retired); Wallace v. Wallace, 5 Haw. App. 55, 57, 677 P.2d 966, 967-68 (1984) (noting same). 3
Here, the family court found that Wife would receive 
$3,001.16
 per month if she retired in 2025 as planned. The 
family court also found that husband was earning $146,500.00 per 
year (or $12,208.33 per month) and had no plans to retire 
although he was eligible.  Husband does not challenge these findings on appeal. Okada Trucking Co., Ltd. v. Bd. of Water
3 Under the Linson formula, "the non- owner party is awarded one- half of 
a percentage of the owner's retirement. The formula for determining the 
percentage is to divide the number of years credited to retirement during themarriage by the total number of years credited to retirement." Donnelly v.
Donnelly
, 98 Hawaiʻi 280, 281, 47 P.3d 747, 748 (App. 2002) (citations and
internal quotation marks omitted). 
"The '
Linson formula,' although not actually included in the Linson 
opinion, has been adopted by this court in calculating the amount ofretirement benefits to be awarded to the non- owner party after divorce." 
Rand v. Rand
, 137 Hawai‘i 206, 366 P.3d 1085, No. CAAP- 12-0000555, 2016 WL 
383158, at *9 n.7 (App. Jan. 29, 2016) (SDO).

Supply
, 97 Hawai‘i 450, 459, 40 P.3d 73, 82 (2002) (holding 
unchallenged factual findings are binding on appeal). 
The family court further found that "[i]t would be 
inequitable for either party to control the date of their 
retirement in a manner that would cause them to receive a financial windfall and/or financially penalize the other party." The family court then concluded that it would be just and 
equitable for each party to begin paying the 
Linson share owed 
to the other when both parties retire. 
The family court faced the following dilemma: if the 
court ordered Wife to pay a Linson share when she retired while 
Husband continued to work, Wife's monthly income would be $1,500.58 ($3,001.16 ÷ 2) and Husband's monthly income would be $13,708.91 ($12,208.33 + $1,500.58). And Wife has no control 
over when (or if) Husband retires. 
Because the family court may adjust the timing of 
Linson share payments to achieve an equitable result, it did not abuse its discretion in ordering the parties to begin paying a share of their retirement benefits to the other upon the retirement of both. 
(2) Second, Husband contends the family court "erred 
in determining the numerator in the formula for division of ERS Hybrid Retirement Plan by including [his] premarital employment 
period and . . . utilizing [Wife's] later start date . . . ." 
5   
 
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Husband argues the family court should have used February 18, 
1990 (date of marriage) instead of December 20, 1987 (Husband's employment date) to determine his payment, and should have used December 19, 1988 (Wife's employment date) instead of June 14, 
1995 (adjusted for breaks in service and leave without pay for 
child care) to determine Wife's payment. 
The family court found that both Husband and Wife were 
initially enrolled in the State's non-contributory retirement plan. They subsequently enrolled in the Hybrid Plan, and converted their non-contributory service by paying mandated conversion fees from funds accumulated during the marriage in their respective State deferred compensation accounts. Wife 
used $32,608.02 and Husband used $123,244.00 to upgrade or 
convert to the Hybrid Plan. The family court further found that neither party presented evidence showing the funds used "were, either whole or in part, pre-marital funds." Husband does not 
challenge these findings. See Okada
, 97 Hawai‘i at 459, 540 P.3d 
at 82. 
The family court therefore determined that, because 
Marital Partnership Property was used to convert each party's 
non-contributory years of service into Hybrid Plan years of service, both Hybrid Plan "accounts became, in their entirety, Marital Partnership Property assets of the marriage." 
6   
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Because Husband used $123,244.00 in funds accumulated 
during the marriage to convert his non-contributory plan to a 
hybrid plan, it was equitable to determine that the entire fund was Marital Partnership Property. As such, the family court did 
not abuse its discretion in using December 21, 1987 (Husband's 
employment date) instead of February 18, 1990 (date of marriage) in dividing this asset. 
The family court also did not abuse its discretion in 
using June 14, 1995 (adjusted for breaks in service and leave without pay for child care) instead of December 19, 1988 (Wife's employment date) to divide Wife's asset. The family court found that Wife's initial start date was December 19, 1988. But, 
"there was a break in her service and when she returned to State 
employment in March of 1997, she was given an adjusted start date of June 14, 1995, in order to make provision for her prior service, the time she was not employed by the State, as well as for time when she took leave without pay for child care/ maternity leave." Husband does not challenge this finding, and we note Husband used this date in his January 21, 2020 Proposed 
Decision and Order Re: Trial. See Okada, 97 Hawai‘ i at 459, 540 
P.3d at 82. 
(3)  Third, Husband contends the family court "erred 
in the usage of the date of divorce as opposed to the Date of 
Conclusion of the Evidentiary Part of Trial (DOCOEPOT) in the 
7   
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
numerator in dividing the respective party's retirement." 
(Emphasis added.) Husband is correct on this point. LaPeter v.
LaPeter, 144 Hawai‘ i 295, 306, 439 P.3d 247, 258 (App. 2019) 
("Under the partnership-model framework endorsed by Hawai
‘i case 
law to divide property of the marital estate, the DOCOEPOT is used in determining the value of property."). Accordingly, on remand, the family court should utilize the DOCOEPOT in the Linson formula apportioning retirement benefits. 
(4)  Fourth, Husband contends the family court erred 
"in determining that there were valid and relevant 
considerations in varying from established property division 
principles by awarding [Wife] a larger portion of the net proceeds of the sale of the parties' former marital residence and waiving [Wife's] property equalization payment in the sum of $5,085.92[.]" 
In his points of error, Husband fails to cite where in 
the record the family court "waived" the $
5,085.92 equalization 
payment Wife owed Husband. 
Instead, the family court determined it would be fair 
and reasonable for Husband to pay five years of alimony at $8,000.00 per year, for a total of $40,000.00. 
In making this 
determination, the family court considered the Hawaiʻi Revised 
Statutes § 580-47 (2018) factors, 
Vorfeld v. Vorfeld, 8 Haw. 
App. 391, 804 P.2d 891 (1991), and the evidence presented. 
8   
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The family court then subtracted the $5,085.92 
equalization payment Wife owed Husband from the $40,000.00 
alimony Husband owed Wife, for a net alimony of $34,914.08. The family court required Husband to pay this amount from his share 
of the net proceeds from the sale of the former marital 
residence. 
Because Husband does not support his "waiver" 
contention and does not challenge the family court's findings and conclusions, we see no abuse of discretion. 
(5) Finally, Husband contends the family court erred 
"in failing to grant [his] Category 3 claim of monetary gifts made by [his] father to [him] during the parties' marriage[.]" 
Under Hawaii's Marital Partnership Model, Category 3 
property is "property separately acquired by gift or inheritance during the marriage but excluding the [net market values] attributable to property that is subsequently legally gifted by the owner to the other spouse, to both spouses, or to a third 
party." Hamilton v. Hamilton
, 138 Hawai‘i 185, 201, 378 P.3d 
901, 917 (2016) (citation omitted). 
Wife's testimony was that the funds from Husband's 
father were deposited into Husband's credit union account then 
transferred into their joint account, or Husband would deposit the funds directly into their joint account. 
Husband admitted 
the funds from his father were deposited in their joint account. 
9   
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Wife would then pay tuition and monthly bills from their joint 
account, as she was primarily responsible for paying their bills. 
The family court found funds from Husband's father 
were always deposited into the couple's joint bank accounts and were never treated as Husband's separate property. The family court further found that the money was used to pay the children's tuition and household expenses. Husband did not present evidence that the checks were treated as his separate property. Husband does not challenge these findings. See
Okada, 97 Hawai‘ i at 459, 540 P.3d at 82. 
Because the family court considered where the funds 
were deposited and how the funds were used in making its determination, the family court did not abuse its discretion. 
Based on the foregoing, we vacate the portions of the 
November 25, 2020 Divorce Decree and Order Re: Husband's 9/10/2020 Motion for Reconsideration to the extent the date of divorce rather than the DOCOEPOT was used as the numerator of the Linson formula, remand for further proceedings consistent with this summary disposition order, and otherwise affirm the remainder. We also affirm the (1) 2/20/2020 Decision and Order; (2) Order Re: Wife's 4/7/2020 Motion for Reconsideration;
