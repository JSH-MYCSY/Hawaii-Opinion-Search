APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 1CC141002192)
ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL
(By:  Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and Nakasone, JJ.)
Upon consideration of the Motion to Dismiss Appeal
(Motion), filed March 29, 2021, by Plaintiff/Counterclaim
Defendant-Appellee U.S. Bank National Association, the papers in
support, and self-represented Defendant/Counterclaim Plaintiff-
Appellant Phyllis Kehaulani Duncan Chun's ( Chun) opposition filed
April 6, 2021,  and the record, it appears we lack appellate
jurisdiction over Chun's appeal from the Circuit Court of the
First Circuit's ( circuit court) interlocutory December 17, 2020
"Order Denying [Chun's] Motion for Summary Judgment" ( Order), in
Civil No. 1CC141002192, because the circuit court has not entered
a final, appealable judgment.1
1  Chun's opposition was filed a day late.  See Hawai #i Rules of
Appellate Procedure Rules 26(a) & 27(a).NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
An aggrieved party typically cannot obtain appellate
review of a circuit court's interlocutory orders in a civil case,
under Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 641-1(a) (2016), until the
circuit court has reduced its dispositive rulings to an
appealable, final judgment under Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure
(HRCP) Rule 58.  See Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright,
76 Hawai# i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994) ("An appeal may
be taken from circuit court orders resolving claims against
parties only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and
the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the
appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]").  In
foreclosure cases, appellate jurisdiction over appeals is further
defined by HRS § 667-51 (2016), which provides for appellate
jurisdiction over, inter alia, a judgment on a decree of
foreclosure.  See Bank of America, N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 139
Hawai#i 361, 371, 390 P.3d 1248, 1258 (2017).  Here, the circuit
court has not entered a final, appealable judgment under HRS
§§ 641-1(a) or 667-51.
Further, the Order does not satisfy the requirements
for an exception to the final-judgment requirement as a
prerequisite for an appeal under the collateral-order doctrine,
the Forgay doctrine, or HRS § 641-1(b) (2016).  See Greer v.
Baker, 137 Hawai#i 249, 253, 369 P.3d 832, 836 (2016) (reciting
the requirements for appeals under the collateral-order doctrine
and the Forgay doctrine); HRS § 641-1(b) (requirements for leave
to file an interlocutory appeal).  
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is
granted and this appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate
jurisdiction.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, April 30, 2021.
