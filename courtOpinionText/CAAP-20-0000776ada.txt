APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 1CC191000907) 
MARCH 16, 2022 
GINOZA, CHIEF JUDGE, HIRAOKA AND MCCULLEN, JJ. 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY HIRAOKA, J. 
The Honolulu 
Police Commission determined that the City 
and County of Honolulu must pay for an attorney to defend former 
Honolulu Police Department (HPD) chief Louis M. Kealoha in a 
federal criminal prosecution. A federal jury later found Kealoha 
guilty. The City appealed the Police Commission's determination FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that Kealoha was entitled to a defense. The Circuit Court of the 
First Circuit affirmed.1 The City filed this secondary appeal. 
For the reasons explained below, we hold that the 
Police Commission properly applied its administrative rules — which are consistent with the language of, and the legislative intent behind, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 52D-8 (2012) and 
52D-9 (2012) — to the relevant facts in the record. Kealoha's 
subsequent conviction did not retroactively vitiate the Police Commission's determination. We affirm the "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Decision and Order" issued by the Police Commission on May 10, 2019; and the "Final Judgment" entered by the circuit court on December 2, 2020. 
I. BACKGROUND 
Kealoha was the chief of HPD. On October 19, 2017, a 
federal grand jury returned a 20-count Indictment against 
Kealoha, Kealoha's wife Katherine Kealoha, and four HPD officers: 
Derek Wayne Hahn, Minh-Hung Nguyen, Gordon Shiraishi, and Daniel 
Sellers.  Indictment, United States v. Kealoha, Case 1:17-cr-00582-JMS-RLP (D. Haw. Oct. 19, 2017) (the Federal Prosecution). The Indictment alleged, among other things, that the defendants 
conspired to frame a person identified as "G.K.P." for stealing 
the Kealohas' mailbox. 
Kealoha — through his attorney, Kevin P.H. Sumida — 
tendered the defense of the Federal Prosecution to the City by 
1 The Honorable James H. Ashford presided. 
2 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
letter to the Police Commission dated March 21, 2018. 
Enclosed 
with the letter was a copy of the Indictment. 
The Police Commission asked Kealoha to complete an HPD 
form HPD-195 (Request for Legal Counsel) and submit it to HPD's 
Professional Standards Office. Kealoha completed the HPD-195, attaching another copy of the Indictment. The Police Commission acknowledged receipt by letter stating: "The Commission will determine whether the acts for which you are being criminally prosecuted were done in the performance of your duties and will consult with the Department of the Corporation Counsel in making its decision." 
The Police Commission asked the City's Department of 
the Corporation Counsel to review Kealoha's HPD-195 and "provide 
. . . a recommendation[.]" Corporation Counsel recommended that 
Kealoha's request "be scheduled for [a] contested case hearing." (Underscoring omitted.) Corporation Counsel indicated that a written recommendation for disposition of the request "will be provided to the Commission in advance of the scheduled hearing date." 
The Police Commission informed Kealoha that he could 
request a contested case hearing. The Police Commission's letter to Sumida stated: "The basic issue to be determined would be whether the act for which [Kealoha] is being prosecuted or sued was done in the performance of an officer's duty as a police officer." Kealoha was informed, "If you do not request [a] hearing . . . the Commission will proceed to grant or deny your 
3 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
request for legal counsel based on the information available 
(including reports referred to in your request for representation and the recommendation of the Corporation Counsel), and will notify you of the final determination." 
Sumida responded, "if the Police Commission has decided 
to deny the request for a defense, then we would request a contested case hearing." Sumida also informed the Police Commission that the Federal Prosecution "now involves more than one criminal case number[.]" Sumida sent the Police Commission copies of the First Superseding Indictment and the Second Superseding Indictment, and the federal district court's Order Clarifying Case Number Assignments and Status of Indictments.
2 
The Police Commission informed Sumida: "Because the 
First and Second Superseding Indictments differ from the initial Indictment submitted by Mr. Kealoha . . . it is necessary for him to submit a [sic] HPD-195 form for each superseding indictment[.]" 
As directed, Kealoha submitted copies of the First 
Superseding Indictment and the Second Superseding Indictment, under separate HPD-195 forms, to HPD. HPD sent the documents to 
2 The order explained that the Indictment in the Federal Prosecution
(Cr. No. 17-00582-JMS-RLP) contained 20 counts. The First Superseding
Indictment contained 23 counts. The federal district court severed counts 1-11 (charging all six defendants) from counts 12-23 (charging the Kealohasonly) for separate trials. The Second Superseding Indictment covered thecrimes charged in counts 12-23, and added two counts against the Kealohasonly. Because of the severed counts, the Second Superseding Indictment wasgiven a separate case number, Cr. No. 18-00068-JMS-RLP. The court then dismissed counts 12-23 from the First Superseding Indictment in Cr. No. 17-00582-JMS-RLP, so that case involved the First Superseding Indictment againstall six defendants, while Cr. No. 18-00068-JMS-RLP involved the SecondSuperseding Indictment against the Kealohas only.

the Police Commission, which sent the documents to Corporation 
Counsel. Corporation Counsel again advised the Police Commission to conduct a contested case hearing on Kealoha's requests, and that a written recommendation would be provided before the hearing date. 
By memorandum dated January 16, 2019, Corporation 
Counsel advised the Police Commission: 
Based on available information, Chief Kealoha's
actions and activities alleged in the Indictments were not
done in the performance of his duties as a police officernor within the course and scope of his employment.Accordingly, it is recommended that the [sic] ChiefKealoha's request for legal representation provided by theCity as described in the [requests for legal services] bedenied. 
A contested case hearing was held on March 6, 2019.3 
Sumida represented Kealoha, who did not attend or testify at the 
hearing. 
On May 10, 2019, the Police Commission issued two 
written decisions. Kealoha's request for counsel for the First Superseding Indictment was granted.  His request for counsel for 
the Second Superseding Indictment was denied.

Sheehan, Chair; Shannon L. Alivado, Vice-Chair; Karen Chang; Gerard G. Gibson;
Steven H. Levinson; and Carrie K.S. Okinaga. 
4 The Police Commission's "Findings of Fact, Conclusion of Law, and
Decision and Order" was signed by Chair Sheehan and members Levinson, Chang,and Okinaga. Vice-Chair Alivado voted against granting Kealoha's request.Commissioner Gibson was not present for the vote.

On June 10, 2019, the City appealed to the circuit 
court from the Police Commission's decision granting Kealoha's 
request for counsel for the First Superseding Indictment.6 The 
City's appeal was heard on October 16, 2020. On November 19, 2020, the circuit court entered an order affirming the Police Commission's decision. The Final Judgment was entered on December 2, 2020. 
This appeal followed.

II. POINTS OF ERROR 
The City's opening brief raises two points of error: 
1. "The circuit court erred in affirming the
[Police] Commission's Decision to grant L.Kealoha's request for legal representationfor the criminal charges filed against him bythe United States in Cr. No. 17-00582"; and 
2. "The circuit court erred when it applied theinsurance policy/complaint allegation ruleanalysis as the analytical framework fordeciding representation requests under HRS§§[]52D-8 and 52D-9." 
6 Kealoha appealed from the Police Commission's decision denying his
request for counsel for the Second Superseding Indictment. As of March 9,2022, Kealoha's appeal remained pending in circuit court. See Kealoha v. City
& Cnty. of Honolulu, 1CC191000913 (Cir. Ct. Haw. appeal docketed June 12,2019). 
7 HRS § 91-14(j) (Supp. 2019) provides: 
The court shall give priority to contested case appeals of
significant statewide importance over all other civil oradministrative appeals or matters and shall decide theseappeals as expeditiously as possible.

III. 
STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A. Administrative Agency Appeal 
Our review of a circuit court decision on an appeal 
from an administrative agency determination is a secondary appeal; we must determine whether the circuit court was right or wrong in its decision, applying the standards set forth in HRS § 91–14(g) (Supp. 2019) to the agency's decision. Flores v. Bd. 
of Land & Nat. Res., 143 Hawai# i 114, 120, 424 P.3d 469, 475 
(2018). 
HRS § 91–14 (Supp. 2019) is entitled "Judicial review 
of contested cases." Subsection (g) provides: 
Upon review of the record, the court may affirm the
decision of the agency or remand the case withinstructions for further proceedings; or it mayreverse or modify the decision and order if thesubstantial rights of the petitioners may have beenprejudiced because the administrative findings,conclusions, decisions, or orders are: 
(1) In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; 
(2) In excess of the statutory authority or
jurisdiction of the agency; 
(3) Made upon unlawful procedure; 
(4) Affected by other error of law; (5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,
probative, and substantial evidence on the
whole record; or 
(6) Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized
by abuse of discretion or clearlyunwarranted exercise of discretion. 
Under HRS § 91-14(g): 
[C]onclusions of law are reviewed de novo , pursuant to
subsections (1), (2) and (4); questions regarding proceduraldefects are reviewable under subsection (3); findings of
fact . . . are reviewable under the clearly erroneousstandard , pursuant to subsection (5), and an agency's 
7 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
exercise of discretion is reviewed under the arbitrary and
capricious standard, pursuant to subsection (6). 
Cmty. Ass'ns of Hualalai, Inc. v. Leeward Plan. Comm'n, 150 
Hawai# i 241, 252, 500 P.3d 426, 437 (2021) (emphasis added) 
(citations omitted). 
An agency's label of a finding of fact or a conclusion 
of law does not determine the standard of review. See Crosby v. 
State Dep't of Budget & Fin., 76 Hawai# i 332, 340, 876 P.2d 1300, 
1308 (1994). 
As a general matter, a finding of fact or a mixed
determination of law and fact is clearly erroneous when
(1) the record lacks substantial evidence to support thefinding or determination, or (2) despite substantialevidence to support the finding or determination, theappellate court is left with the definite and firmconviction that a mistake has been made. Substantial evidence is credible evidence which is of sufficient qualityand probative value to enable a person of reasonable cautionto support a conclusion. 
Del Monte Fresh Produce (Haw.), Inc. v. International Longshore & 
Warehouse Union, Local 142, 128 Hawai# i 289, 302, 287 P.3d 190, 
203 (2012) (citation omitted). 
If an agency's finding or 
conclusion presents mixed questions of fact and law, is supported by valid findings of fact, and reflects an application of the correct rule of law, it will not be overturned. See Est. of 
Klink ex rel. Klink v. State, 113 Hawai# i 332, 351, 152 P.3d 504, 
523 (2007). 
In addition, "[w]here both mixed questions of fact and 
law are presented, deference will be given to the agency's expertise and experience in the particular field and the court should not substitute its own judgment for that of the agency."

IV. DISCUSSION 
A. Statutory and Regulatory Structure 
HRS § 52D-8 (2012) provides: 
Police officers; counsel for . Whenever a police officer is
prosecuted for a crime or sued in a civil action[8] for acts
done in the performance of the officer's duty as a police
officer, the police officer shall be represented anddefended: 
(1) In criminal proceedings by an attorney to beemployed and paid by the county in which theofficer is serving; and 
(2) In civil cases by the corporation counsel orcounty attorney of the county in which thepolice officer is serving. 
The legislature intended that the statute maintain "the morale of 
the [police] force" "in view of the increasing number of charges, both civil and criminal, brought against police officers[.]" Alejado v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 89 Hawai# i 221, 229-30, 971 
P.2d 310, 318-19 (App. 1999) (quoting S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 376, in 1941 Senate Journal, at 860–61).

8 This appeal involves a police officer prosecuted for a crime; this
opinion does not address the circumstances under which a police officer sued
in a civil action would be entitled to representation under HRS § 52D-8. 
9 We also noted that HRS § 52D-8 was "similar to" Cal. Gov't Code
§ 995. Alejado, 89 Hawai #i at 228, 971 P.2d at 317. Of the California 
statute, one appellate court explained: 
The reason for the rule is: ["]The duties of a [policeofficer] are performed for the benefit of the public. . . .["] With such protection afforded, the public canexpect that its laws will be zealously enforced without anyhesitation occasioned by considerations of possible personalinvolvement in defending resulting litigation.

9 (...continued)The police commission of each county has exclusive 
original jurisdiction to determine whether a police officer is 
entitled to a defense under HRS § 52D-8. HRS § 52D-9 (2012) provides: 
Determination of scope of duty . The determination of 
whether an act, for which the police officer is being
prosecuted or sued, was done in the performance of thepolice officer's duty, so as to entitle the police officerto be represented by counsel provided by the county, shallbe made by the police commission of the county. Before making a determination, the police commission shall consultthe county attorney or the corporation counsel, who may makea recommendation to the police commission with respectthereto if the county attorney or corporation counsel sodesires. The determination of the police commission shallbe conclusive for the purpose of this section and section52D-8. 
See Alejado, 89 Hawai# i at 226, 971 P.2d at 315. The statute's 
reference to the "conclusiveness" of the police commission's 
determination refers to the City's procedures; it does not preclude judicial review. Id. at 231, 971 P.2d at 320. 
The Police Commission is authorized to adopt rules 
necessary for the conduct of its business. Revised Charter of the City and County of Honolulu (RCCCH) § 6-1606 (2017).  Rule 11 
of the Rules of the Honolulu Police Commission (RHPC) applies to the Police Commission's determinations under HRS § 52D-9. RHPC 
Rule 11-1 provides, in relevant part: 
(e) For purposes of this Rule 11, the following shall be
considered by the Commission in determining whether"an act, for which the police officer is beingprosecuted or sued, was done in the performance of theofficer's duty": 
official tasks"). 
11 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(i) whether the act was incident to required or
authorized work-related activity; 
(ii) whether the act was incident to a course of conduct taking place at a time that the officerwas required to engage in the course of conductby the nature of the officer's responsibilitiesas a police officer; and 
(iii) whether the act was incident to a course ofconduct engaged in at a place that the officerwas authorized to engage in it by the nature ofthe officer's responsibilities as a policeofficer. 
The City does not challenge the validity of RHPC 
Rule 11-1; the City challenges only the manner in which the rule 
was applied in this case. We note that the language of RHPC Rule 11-1 is consistent with both the plain language of HRS §§ 52D-8 and 52D-9, and the legislature's stated intent to maintain the morale of the police force, see Alejado, 89 Hawai# i 
at 229-30, 971 P.2d at 318–19. 
Within this framework we first address the City's 
structural argument, then its substantive one. 
B. The City's Structural Argument 1. The "complaint allegation rule" does not
apply to a county police commission's
determination under HRS § 52D-8. 
The circuit court held: 
8. The Court finds that the tripartite relationship
among the officer, the county, and the officer's appointed
attorney is analogous to the relationship among an insurer,defense counsel, and the insured, and, as such, theobligation to defend is determined by the complaint
allegation rule . The Court finds this rule to be the 
appropriate analytical framework. 
12 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(Emphasis added.) The City contends that the circuit court erred 
by applying the "complaint allegation rule" to the Police Commission's review of Kealoha's request for counsel. 
Under Hawai# i law, the complaint allegation rule 
determines a liability insurer's duty to defend its insured (and, in some cases, a non-insurer indemnitor's contractual duty to defend an indemnitee) in a civil action seeking an award of damages: 
If a complaint alleges claims that fall within the coverage
of the indemnity provision, then, according to the complaintallegation rule, the duty to defend begins. This is separate and distinct from the duty to indemnify. Once the trier of fact makes a determination on the claims in the lawsuit, the duty to indemnify will either arise or liedormant. Claims falling within the indemnity provision willtrigger the duty to indemnify, while claims falling outsidethe provision will relieve the indemnitor of [their] duty toindemnify. In our view, this is the only equitableinterpretation that gives life to non-insurance indemnityclauses and prevents indemnitors from benumbing the duty todefend until after a case has been litigated. 
Arthur v. State, Dep't of Hawaiian Home Lands, 138 Hawai# i 85, 96, 
377 P.3d 26, 37 (2016) (quoting Pancakes of Haw., Inc. v. Pomare 
Props. Corp., 85 Hawai# i 286, 292, 944 P.2d 83, 89 (App. 1997)).10 
The circuit court's analogy to the tripartite 
relationship that arises when a liability insurer pays the cost for an attorney to represent an insured is understandable given the case law addressing whether counsel retained by a county to defend a police officer in a criminal case had a conflict of interest. See Fragiao, 95 Hawai# i at 20, 18 P.3d at 882 ("[T]he 
10 In Arthur, the supreme court held that the complaint allegation
rule did not apply to indemnity provisions in construction contracts, citing
HRS § 431:10–222 ("Construction industry; indemnity agreements invalid.").Id. at 97, 377 P.3d at 38. 
13 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
tripartite relationship among the County, [the lawyer paid by the 
County to defend the police officer], and [the police officer] is analogous to the relationship among an insurer, defense counsel, and insured, cited with approval in Comment 10 to [Hawai# i Rules 
of Professional Conduct] Rule 1.7 and discussed in Finley
.") 
(citing Finley v. Home Ins. Co., 90 Hawai# i 25, 975 P.2d 1145 
(1998)). 
The analogy does not, however, extend to the City's 
obligation to defend a police officer against criminal charges under HRS § 52D-8. A liability insurer's duty to defend is contractual in nature, determined by the language of the insurance policy. Hawaiian Holiday Macadamia Nut Co. v. Indus. 
Indem. Co., 76 Hawai# i 166, 169, 872 P.2d 230, 233 (1994). The 
insurer's duty to defend is triggered "whenever there is a potential for indemnification liability of the insurer to the insured." Id. Determining the "potential for indemnification 
liability" under an insurance policy simply means asking the question: "If all of the factual allegations of the complaint are proven to be true, would any portion of the resultant legal liability be covered under the defendant's insurance policy?" If the answer is "yes" then there is a duty to defend under the complaint allegation rule; if the answer is "no" then there is no duty to defend. See id. ("The duty to defend is limited to 
situations where the pleadings have alleged claims for relief which fall within the terms for coverage of the insurance contract. Where pleadings fail to allege any basis for recovery 
14  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
within the coverage clause, the insurer has no obligation to 
defend.") (citations omitted). 
By contrast, a county's obligation to defend a police 
officer being prosecuted for a crime is statutory, determined by the language of HRS § 52D-8. That statute obligates a county to pay for counsel "[w]henever a police officer is prosecuted for a 
crime . . . for acts done in the performance of the officer's 
duty as a police officer." (Emphasis added.) Significantly, the 
county police commission's decision is made before determination of the police officer's guilt or innocence. Compare HRS § 52D-8, 
with Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. § 53-39a (West).
11 The complaint 
allegation rule would require that the county police commission assume the criminal charges against the police officer — including the officer's alleged motive for the alleged acts — to be true. That would be contrary to the plain language of, and the legislative intent behind, HRS § 52D-8. The complaint allegation rule did not apply to the Police Commission's determination in this case. 
2. The "scope of employment" test does not
apply to a county police commission's
determination under HRS § 52D-8. 
11 Connecticut requires that police officers defend themselves
against criminal charges arising out of their conduct as police officers.
"Section 53–39a . . . authorizes indemnification for . . . legal fees[]incurred by officers of local police departments who are prosecuted for crimesallegedly committed by them in the course of their duties when the chargesagainst them are dismissed or they are found not guilty." Cislo v. City of
Shelton, 692 A.2d 1255, 1260 (Conn. 1997) (citation omitted). By contrast,HRS § 52D-8 requires a defense, not indemnity. 
15 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The City contends the appropriate test to determine 
whether a police officer is entitled to a defense under HRS 
§ 52D-8 is the "scope of employment" test. That test is used to determine an employer's vicarious tort liability for acts or omission by an employee under the common-law doctrine of respondeat superior.
12 Under that test: 
(1) Conduct of a servant is within the scope of employment
if, but only if: 
(a) it is of the kind [the servant] is employed to
perform; 
(b) it occurs substantially within the authorizedtime and space limits; [and] 
(c) it is actuated, at least in part, by a purpose
to serve the master [.] 
. . . . 
(2) Conduct of a servant is not within the scope of
employment if it is different in kind from that authorized,far beyond the authorized time or space limits, or too 
little actuated by a purpose to serve the master . 
Henderson v. Pro. Coatings Corp., 72 Haw. 387, 392, 819 P.2d 84, 
88 (1991) (emphasis added) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Agency § 228 (1958)); see also Wong-Leong v. Hawaiian Indep. Refinery, Inc., 76 Hawai# i 433, 441, 879 P.2d 538, 546 (1994) ("In 
determining the scope of employment, the applicable test is whether . . . the enterprise derived any benefit from the activity.") (citations omitted). 
12 Our reference in Alejado to "course and scope of employment" was a
quote from the former "Guidelines of the Honolulu Police Commission Request
for Legal Counsel[.]" 89 Hawai #i at 223 n.2, 971 P.2d at 312 n.2. Alejado
did not address RHPC Rule 11-1, nor did we decide that the "scope ofemployment" test applied to the police officer's request for legalrepresentation at issue in that case. In this case, the City conceded thatRHPC Rule 11-1 does "not use a 'scope of employment' analysis." 
16 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Nothing in HRS §§ 52D-8 or 52D-9, or in RHPC Rule 11-1, 
implicates a police officer's "purpose to serve" HPD (or lack 
thereof), or whether HPD derived any benefit from the police officer's alleged acts. 
As the Police Commission points out, 
"HRS § 52D-8 does not require examination of the motive or intent of a police officer in determining whether legal representation shall be provided." (Underscoring omitted). The plain language of HRS § 52D–8 requires that a county pay for a police officer's defense if the officer is prosecuted for "acts done in the 
performance of the officer's duty as a police officer[.]" 
(Emphasis added.) Application of the "scope of employment" test — elements of which are the police officer's intent to serve the police department and the police department's having derived a benefit from the officer's alleged acts — would be contrary to the plain language of HRS § 52D–8 and RHPC Rule 11-1. It is hard to think of any crime committed by a police officer that could have been intended by the officer to serve the police department, or from which the department could derive any benefit. Application of the common-law "scope of employment" test would defeat both the plain language of HRS § 52D-8 and the legislature's intent to maintain the morale of the police force. See Alejado, 89 Hawai# i at 229-30, 971 P.2d at 318–19. The scope 
of employment test did not apply to the Police Commission's determination in this case.

3. Kealoha was not required to testify
at his contested case hearing. 
The City also argues that Kealoha failed to sustain his 
burdens of proof, production, and persuasion13 by failing to 
testify during his contested case hearing that he intended the 
acts for which he was being prosecuted to benefit the City. 
A police officer being prosecuted for a crime has a 
constitutionally protected property right to county-provided legal representation if the officer is prosecuted for acts done in the performance of the officer's duty as a police officer. See Alejado, 89 Hawai# i at 229-30, 971 P.2d at 318-19. The 
officer may not be deprived of that right without due process. Id. at 230-31, 971 P.2d at 319-20. "[D]ue process requires that the [Police] Commission conduct contested case hearings[,]" id. at 225, 971 P.2d at 314 (citations omitted), "with the full procedural protection afforded by [the Hawai# i Administrative 
13 In support of this argument, the City directs this court to the

Procedure Act,]" id. at 231, 971 P.2d at 320 (underscoring 
omitted). 
A police officer being prosecuted for a crime also has 
a constitutional right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1, section 10 of the Hawai# i Constitution. See State v. Bowe, 77 
Hawai# i 51, 57, 881 P.2d 538, 544 (1994). Requiring Kealoha to 
testify before the Police Commission — in a contested case hearing open to the public — during the pendency of the Federal Prosecution would have required that he waive his constitutional right against self-incrimination in order to obtain the defense for which HRS § 52D-8 provides, in violation of his right to due process. See State v. Valera, 74 Haw. 424, 438, 848 P.2d 376, 
382 (1993) (holding that use at sentencing of statements obtained in violation of defendant's privilege against self-incrimination violates defendant's right to due process); HRS § 91-10(1) (2012) ("The agencies shall give effect to the rules of privilege recognized by law[.]"). 
Having to choose between his constitutional right 
against self-incrimination and his right to a defense under HRS § 52D-8 would also have impermissibly placed Kealoha in the proverbial Procrustean dilemma
14 described by the supreme court in

would tell passing travelers that he owned a special bed that exactly matched
whoever lay down on it, no matter how short or tall. What the guests were nottold was that Procrustes would stretch them on a rack if they were too shortfor his bed, or chop off their legs if they were too tall. In either case,the guest would die. The phrase "Procrustean bed" "has become proverbial forarbitrarily – and perhaps ruthlessly – forcing someone or something to fit

required to testify during his contested case hearing. 
4. HRS § 52D-8 requires that a county
police commission consider the policeofficer's alleged act, but not theofficer's alleged motive. 
Under the Hawai# i Penal Code every criminal offense must 
contain a conduct element. State v. Mita, 124 Hawai# i 385, 391, 
245 P.3d 458, 464 (2010). HRS § 702-205 (2014) provides: 
The elements of an offense are such (1) conduct ,
(2) attendant circumstances, and (3) results of conduct, as: 
(a) Are specified by the definition of the offense,and 
(b) Negative a defense (other than a defense basedon the statute of limitations, lack of venue, orlack of jurisdiction). 
(Emphasis added.)15 "Conduct" is defined as "an act or omission, 
or, where relevant, a series of acts or a series of omissions, or 
a series of acts and omissions." HRS § 701-118 (2012). 
The plain language of HRS § 52D–8 and RHPC Rule 11-1 
implicates the police officer's conduct (as defined by HRS § 701-
into an unnatural scheme or pattern." 
The Editors of Encyclopedia Britannica,
Procrustes, Britannica, https://www.britannica.com/topic/Procrustes (last
updated Jan. 4, 2011). Procrustes was eventually killed by Theseus, but thatcould be a subject for another footnote in another case. 
15 Federal law is similar. See United States v. Apfelbaum, 445 U.S.
115, 131 (1980) ("In the criminal law, both a culpable mens rea and a criminalactus reus are generally required for an offense to occur."). "Mens rea" is 
"[t]he state of mind that the prosecution, to secure a conviction, must provethat a defendant had when committing a crime[.]" Mens Rea, Black's Law

118); it does not implicate the police officer's motive for 
committing the alleged act for which the officer is being prosecuted. HRS § 52D–8 requires that a police commission determine whether the act allegedly committed by the police 
officer was within "the performance of the officer's duty as a 
police officer[.]" In making that determination, a police commission must consider the allegations made in the charging document concerning the police officer's acts — the conduct 
element — and disregard allegations about the officer's motive 
for committing the alleged acts. If the acts alleged were within 
the performance of the officer's duty as a police officer, the 
officer is entitled to a defense under HRS § 52D–8, regardless of the officer's alleged motive.

We next address the City's substantive argument. 
C. The circuit court did not err in affirming
the Police Commission's determination that Kealoha was entitled to defense counsel for the First Superseding Indictment. 
On appeal to the circuit court, the City challenged the 
Police Commission's findings of fact (FOF) nos. 18, 19, 20, and 
21; conclusions of law (COL) nos. 2 and 3;
17 and the decision and 
order granting Kealoha's request for defense counsel. 
16 The Police Commission's second conclusion of law no. 3 
appropriately stated: "The Commission renders no conclusion of law regarding
the merits of the First Superseding Indictment." Determining the merits ofthe First Superseding Indictment — including Kealoha's alleged subjectiveintent behind his alleged conduct — was the role of the federal jury, not thePolice Commission. 
17 The Police Commission's conclusions of law contained two 
conclusions of law no. 3. The City challenges the first conclusion of lawno. 3. 
21 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
1. Finding of Fact No. 18 
The Police Commission found, in relevant part: 
18. The Commission finds that the factual 
allegations in Paragraph 37a of the First Superseding
Indictment  . . . which provide "in relevant part that in or
about June 2011, L. KEALOHA caused CIU[18] officers to
conduct physical surveillance of G.K.P., and to continuesuch surveillance from time to time through June2013"[ ]allege acts done in the performance of Kealoha'sduty as a police officer because the alleged acts , even if
unlawful and regardless of motive , were incident to: (a) "a
required or authorized work-related activity"; (b) "a courseof conduct taking place at a time that the officer wasrequired to engage in the course of conduct by the nature ofthe officer's responsibilities as a police officer;" [sic]and (c) "a course of conduct engaged in at a place that theofficer was authorized to engage in it by the nature of theofficer's responsibilities as a police officer." See [RHPC]
Rules [sic] 11-1(e)(i)-(iii). 
(Cleaned up) (emphasis added). 
FOF no. 18 is a mixed finding of fact and conclusion of 
law. To the extent it is a finding of fact it is not clearly 
erroneous because paragraph 37 of the First Superseding Indictment alleged, in relevant part: 
37. In furtherance of the conspiracy, the
conspirators committed the following overt acts, among
others, within the District of Hawaii and elsewhere: 
18 According to the First Superseding Indictment: 
A separate, federally-authorized and specialized unit of HPD
called the Criminal Intelligence Unit ("CIU") wasresponsible for gathering intelligence and data on organizedcrime, terrorism, and gang threats facing the City andCounty of Honolulu. The members of CIU did not collect evidence to be used in the investigation and prosecution ofcriminal cases, but instead, passed intelligence informationabout criminal threats to other units in HPD and federal law enforcement partners. Because of their specialized dutiesand responsibilities, officers in CIU were supervised by alieutenant, who reported to a captain, who ultimatelyreported to the Chief of Police, which from 2009 to 2017 wasL. KEALOHA. Due to that close relationship, the Chief ofPolice played a direct role in selecting and appointingofficers to CIU. 
22 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
a. In or about June 2011, L. KEALOHA . . .
caused CIU officers to conduct physical surveillance
of G.K.P., and to continue such surveillance from timeto time through June 2013. 
To the extent FOF no. 18 was a conclusion of law, it 
was not wrong. HRS § 52D-3 (2012) provides: 
The chief of police shall have the powers and duties asprescribed by law, the respective county charter, and asprovided by this chapter. 
RCCCH § 6-1604 describes the powers, duties, and functions of the 
chief of HPD: 
The chief of police shall: (a) Be responsible for the preservation of the public
peace; the protection of the rights of persons andproperty; the prevention of crime; the detection andarrest of offenders against the law and theenforcement and prevention of violations of all lawsof the state and city ordinances and all rules andregulations made in accordance therewith. 
(b) Train, equip, maintain and supervise the force ofpolice officers. 
. . . . 
(g) Perform such other duties as may be required by thischarter or by law. 
The scope of the chief's duty under RCCCH § 6-1604 is extremely 
broad. It applies 24 hours per day, covers all of the City and County of Honolulu, and includes supervision of all police officers within HPD.
 19
19 Any police officer, even while "off duty" — that is, outside of
the officer's scheduled work shift and/or assigned beat or duty station — may
be called upon to perform their duty as a police officer. HRS § 52D-15 (2012)provides: 
Off-duty police officers; benefits for personal injuries .

It was within the scope of Kealoha's duty as chief to 
cause HPD officers to surveil a suspect. The act of authorizing 
surveillance was thus "incident to required or authorized work-related activity" by Kealoha. 
For purposes of HRS § 52D-8, causing "CIU officers to 
conduct physical surveillance of G.K.P." was an act "done in the performance of [Kealoha]'s duty as a police officer." It was "incident to required or authorized work-related activity" under

course of conduct taking place at a time that the officer was 
required to engage in the course of conduct by the nature of the 
officer's responsibilities as a police officer" under RHPC Rule 11-1(e)(ii). (Emphasis added.) And it was "incident to a course of conduct engaged in at a place that the officer was authorized 
to engage in it by the nature of the officer's responsibilities 
as a police officer" under RHPC Rule 11-1(e)(iii). (Emphasis

The Police Commission's conclusion was supported by its 
findings of fact and was a correct application of the law. 
2. Finding of Fact No. 19 
The Police Commission found, in relevant part: 
19. The Commission finds that the factual 
allegations in Paragraph 37cc  . . . which provide in
relevant part that "on or about June 27, 2013, L. KEALOHA

See [RHPC] Rules

(Cleaned up) (emphasis added). 
FOF no. 19 is a mixed finding of fact and conclusion of 
law. To the extent it is a finding of fact it is not clearly 
erroneous because paragraph 37 of the First Superseding Indictment alleged, in relevant part: 
37. In furtherance of the conspiracy, the
conspirators committed the following overt acts, among
others, within the District of Hawaii and elsewhere:

false police report identifying G.K.P. as the suspectof an alleged burglary at the KEALOHAs' then personalresidence on June 23 or 24, 2013. 
It was within the scope of Kealoha's duty as chief to 
cause HPD officers to prepare reports. Thus, for purposes of HRS 
§ 52D-8, Kealoha's alleged participation in the creation of a 
25 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
report about G.K.P. was an act "done in the performance of 
[Kealoha]'s duty as a police officer" and "incident to required or authorized work-related activity" under RHPC Rule 11-1(e)(i).The Police Commission's conclusion was supported by its findingsof fact and was a correct application of HRS § 52D-8 and RHPC Rule 11-1(e)(i)-(iii).   
3. Finding of Fact No. 20 
The Police Commission found, in relevant part: 
20. The Commission finds that the factual 
allegations in Paragraph 37ee  . . . which provide in
relevant part that, "on or about June 29, 2013, L. KEALOHA
caused DANIEL SELLERS to direct HPD officers to arrest G.K.P. for stealing their mailbox," allege acts done in theperformance of Kealoha's duty as a police officer becausethe alleged act , even if unlawful and regardless of motive ,
was incident to: (a) "a required or to [sic] authorizedwork-related activity"; (b) "a course of conduct takingplace at a time that the officer was required to engage inthe course of conduct by the nature of the officer'sresponsibilities as a police officer;" [sic] and (c) "acourse of conduct engaged in at a place that the officer wasauthorized to engage in it by the nature of the officer'sresponsibilities as a police officer."

On or about June 29, 2013, L. KEALOHA
. . . caused DANIEL SELLERS to direct HPD officers to arrest G.K.P. for stealing their mailbox. 
26 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
It was within the scope of Kealoha's duty as chief to 
cause HPD officers to arrest persons suspected of committing a 
crime. 
Thus, for purposes of HRS § 52D-8, Kealoha's act of 
instructing Sellers to cause other police officers to arrest G.K.P. would have been "done in the performance of [Kealoha]'s duty as a police officer" and "incident to required or authorized work-related activity" under RHPC Rule 11-1(e)(i). The Police Commission's conclusion was supported by its findings of fact and was a correct application of HRS § 52D-8 and RHPC Rule 11-1(e)(i)-(iii). 
4. Finding of Fact No. 21 
The Police Commission found, in relevant part: 
21. The Commission finds that the factual 
allegations in Paragraph 37ff  . . . which provide that "on
or about June 29, 2013, between 5:09 p.m. and 5:12 p.m.,
L. KEALOHA and DEREK WAYNE HAHN exchanged approximatelythree phone calls," allege facts done in the performance ofKealoha's duty as a police officer because the alleged acts,
regardless of motive , were incident to: (a) "a required or
authorized work-related activity"; (b) "a course of conducttaking place at a time that the officer was required toengage in the course of conduct by the nature of theofficer's responsibilities as a police officer;" [sic] and(c) "a course of conduct engaged in at a place that theofficer was authorized to engage in it by the nature of theofficer's responsibilities as a police officer."

ff. 
On or about June 29, 2013, between
5:09 p.m. and 5:12 p.m., L. KEALOHA and DEREK WAYNE
HAHN exchanged approximately three phone calls. 
The First Superseding Indictment also alleged that on 
June 29, 2013: Kealoha's wife identified G.K.P. as the person 
shown in a security video stealing the Kealohas' mailbox; Kealoha caused Sellers to have G.K.P. arrested for stealing the mailbox; and Hahn was the person who supervised HPD CIU officers (including Sellers). It was within Kealoha's duty as chief to communicate with subordinate officers to effectuate the arrest of a person suspected of committing a crime. Thus, for purposes of HRS § 52D-8, Kealoha's alleged phone calls with Hahn on the day G.K.P. was arrested would (if they concerned the arrest) have been "done in the performance of [Kealoha]'s duty as a police officer" and "incident to required or authorized work-related activity" under RHPC Rule 11-1(e)(i). The Police Commission's conclusion was supported by its findings of fact and was a correct application of HRS § 52D-8 and RHPC Rule 11-1(e)(i)-(iii).

The Police Commission concluded, in relevant part: 
2. Pursuant to Rule 11-l(e) of the Honolulu Police
Commission Rules 2018, effective October 28, 2018, 
the following shall be considered by the
Commission in determining whether 'an act, forwhich the police officer is being prosecuted orsued, was done in the performance of theofficers' [sic] duty':

The City does not contend that RHPC Rule 11-1(e) is 
ambiguous or that it is legally inconsistent with HRS § 52D-8. 
The plain language of RHPC Rule 11-1(e) and its subparts establish factors for the Police Commission to consider in determining whether an act for which a police officer is being 
prosecuted was "done in the performance of the officer's duty as 
a police officer" within the meaning of HRS § 52D-8. Consistent with the plain language of (and legislative intent behind) HRS § 52D-8, the rule does not include the police officer's motive as a factor. 
6. Conclusion of Law No. 3 
The Police Commission concluded, in relevant part: 
3. Kealoha's alleged acts, referred to supra in
Paragraphs 18, 19, 20, and 21 were done in the performance
of Kealoha's duty as a police officer so as to entitle himto be represented and defended by an attorney to be employedand paid by the City and County of Honolulu, pursuant to HRS§§ 52D-8 and -9. 
COL no. 3 was supported by the Police Commission's findings of 
fact (about the allegations contained in the First Superseding Indictment) and was a correct application of HRS § 52D-8 and RHPC Rule 11-1(e)(i)-(iii). 
7. Decision and Order 
The Police Commission concluded, in relevant part: 
Pursuant to the foregoing Findings of Fact and
Conclusions of Law, the Commission finds that LOUIS M.
KEALOHA has met his burden of proof and persuasion regarding 
30 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
his claim for representation and further pursuant to HRS
§ 52D-9, the Commission hereby GRANTS Kealoha's request forlegal counsel. 
Kealoha met his burdens of proof and persuasion by providing the 
First Superseding Indictment to the Police Commission. The Police Commission's decision and order was supported by its findings of fact and was a correct application of HRS § 52D-8 and RHPC Rule 11-1(e)(i)-(iii). 
We take judicial notice, pursuant to Rule 201 of the 
Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE),

found Kealoha guilty on counts 1, 2, 6, and 8 of the First Superseding Indictment. Minutes, United States v. Kealoha, Case 1:17-cr-00582-JMS-WRP (D. Haw. June 27, 2019), ECF No. 834. The verdict was returned on June 27, 2019; on May 10, 2019, when the Police Commission's Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Decision and Order were issued, Kealoha's guilt or innocence had not been determined.

Kealoha's eventual conviction did not retroactively vitiate the Police Commission's application of RHPC Rule 11-1(e). It would have been contrary to the plain language of, and legislative intent behind, HRS § 52D-8 to require that the Police Commission engage in fact-finding and decide the merits of the criminal charge to determine whether Kealoha was entitled to a defense under HRS § 52D-8. 
V. CONCLUSION
