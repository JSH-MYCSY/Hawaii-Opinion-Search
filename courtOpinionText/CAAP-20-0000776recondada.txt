APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 1CC191000907)  
ORDER DENYING RECONSIDERATION 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Hiraoka and McCullen, JJ.) 
Appellant-Appellant City and County of Honolulu's
Motion for Reconsideration, filed March 28, 2022, contends: 
"1. 
The Court overlooked that the circuit 
court's and the Honolulu Police Commission's 
rulings regarding the complaint allegation ruleare inconsistent with the Court's Opinionregarding said doctrine and should thus bevacated"; and 
"2. The Court misapprehended the City's
argument with regard to the requirement that LouisKealoha's ("Kealoha") actions for which he wascriminally charged must have been actuated atleast in part by a purpose to serve his (nowformer) employer and overlooked the constitutionalproblem that arises by not requiring that employerconnection."

1. This Court's task on the City's secondary appeal 
was to determine whether the Circuit Court's Final Judgment was 
right or wrong by applying the standards set forth in Hawaii 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 91–14(g) (Supp. 2019) to the Honolulu
Police Commission's "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and 
Decision and Order" (Decision & Order). See Flores v. Bd. of 
Land & Nat. Res.
, 143 Hawai# i 114, 120, 424 P.3d 469, 475 (2018) 
(explaining that the "standard of review is one in which this 
court must determine whether the circuit court was right or wrong in its decision, applying the standards set forth in HRS § 91
-
14(g) [1993] to the agency's decision") (brackets in original) (citations omitted). 
The Police Commission's Decision & Order did not 
mention or apply the complaint allegation rule.
1 We held that 
the Police Commission properly applied its administrative rules to the relevant facts in the record. Accordingly, this Court's Opinion affirmed the Final Judgment, which affirmed the Police Commission's Decision & Order. 
The complaint allegation rule was cited in the Circuit 
Court's "Order Affirming Findings of Facts, Conclusions of Law, and Decision and Order Dated May 10, 2019 of the Honolulu Police Commission" (Order Affirming Decision & Order). This Court's 
Opinion did not affirm the Order Affirming Decision & Order; to 
the contrary, we held that "[t]he complaint allegation rule does 
not apply to the Police Commission's determination in this case." 
Opinion at 15 (emphasis added). 
The Circuit Court's Final Judgment did not mention the 
complaint allegation rule. This Court's Opinion affirmed the 
Final Judgment because the Final Judgment affirmed the Police Commission's Decision & Order, notwithstanding the Circuit 
1 As the City points out, during the Police Commission's contested
case hearing Kealoha's attorney advocated application of the complaint
allegation rule. However, the Police Commission's Decision & Order neithercites nor applies the complaint allegation rule, and the record contains noother indication that the Police Commission applied the complaint allegationrule to its HRS § 52D-19 determination. 
2 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Court's erroneous application of the complaint allegation rule. 
See State v. Enos
, 147 Hawai# i 150, 164, 465 P.3d 597, 611 (2020) 
(noting "it is well-settled that an appellate court may affirm a judgment of the lower court on any ground in the record that supports affirmance") (cleaned up).
2. The City contends that this Court erroneously 
rejected the "scope of employment" test because the "granting of Kealoha's legal request to defend him against the federal corruption charges means public funds would be expended without a public purpose to support it in contravention of constitutional limits." 
The City did not raise an "unconstitutional as applied" 
argument before the Police Commission or in its appeal to the Circuit Court. Thus, we decline to address this constitutional challenge. State v. Hicks
, 113 Hawai# i 60, 74, 148 P.3d 493, 507 
(2006) (declining to address a constitutional challenge raised for the first time on appeal). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the City's Motion 
for Reconsideration is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, 
Hawai# i, April 5, 2022.
