THOMAS FLORES, Claimant-Appellant/Appellant, v. 
SAFEWAY, INC., Employer-Appellee/Appellee,

APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD 
(CASE NO. AB 2020-077; DCD NO. 2-18-07679) 
  
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Hiraoka and McCullen, JJ)
 
  Self
-Represented Claimant-Appellant/Appellant Thomas 
Flores appeals from the Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals 
Board's (LIRAB) December 7, 2020 Decision and Order (Decision 
and Order) dismissing his untimely appeal to LIRAB. 
  As a preliminary matter, 
Flores' Opening Brief does 
not comply with Hawai‘i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP)  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

   Rule 28.  Flores does not provide points of error or record 
references. 
Although an appellant's brief does not comply with 
HRAP Rule 28, the Hawai‘ i appellate courts adhere to a "policy of 
affording litigants the opportunity to have their cases heard on 
the merits, where possible."  Marvin v. Pflueger, 127 
Hawai‘i 
490, 496, 280 P.3d 88, 94 (2012) (citation and internal 
quotation marks omitted).  Accordingly, to promote access to 
justice, we liberally interpret pleadings prepared by self-
represented litigants and attempt to provide them appellate review despite their failure to comply with the appellate rules.  
See Erum v. Llego, 147 Hawai‘ i 368, 380-81, 465 P.3d 815, 827-28 
(2020). 
From what we can discern, Flores (1) challenges this 
court's jurisdiction, and (2) requests we remand this case to 
the Disability Compensation Division. 
  Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve the 
point of error as discussed below, and affirm. 
  As relevant to this appeal, Flores filed a notice of 
appeal to LIRAB on January 6, 2020.  It was unclear from the  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 notice of appeal what Flores was appealing.  On September 15, 
2020, LIRAB ordered Flores and Employer-Appellee/Appellee 
Safeway, Inc. to "Show Cause why this appeal, filed on 
January 6, 2020, should not be dismissed as untimely or for lack of jurisdiction."  Safeway responded, and requested LIRAB 
dismiss Flores' appeal with prejudice as it was untimely.  
Flores also responded, asserting "[t]he notice[] received was 
postmarked 12/23/19 and a copy of the postmark was submitted as 
evidence when the appeal was made[,]" but he did not further 
address whether LIRAB should dismiss the appeal.

After Flores requested more time to specify the 
decision from which he appealed, LIRAB entered an amended order 
to show cause on October 9, 2020, giving Flores until October 22, 2020, "to identify, in writing to the Board, the 
'*Post Marked 12/23/19' item from which he appealed."  The 
record does not reflect a written response from Flores. 
During the December 3, 2020 hearing on the order to 
show cause, Flores "expressed that his January 6, 2020 appeal 
related to Employer's request to quash a subpoena."  On 
December 7, 2020, LIRAB dismissed Flores' January 6, 2020

amount of time[,]" and the remainder of his response discussed the subpoena, 
video surveillance, and coverage under Workers' Compensation. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

   appeal, finding that the "December 4, 2019 decision by the 
Director essentially denied production of a video . . . by 
considering it 'resolved,' because Claimant's work injury had 
been accepted as compensable."  LIRAB also found that:  "[t]he Director's decision was dated and sent to the parties on 
December 4, 2019[;]" an appeal from the December 4, 2019 
decision was due by December 24, 2019, but Flores filed his 
appeal on January 6, 2020; and the appeal was untimely. 
In his appeal to this court, Flores does not challenge 
any findings by LIRAB and we are thus bound by LIRAB's findings.  
See Okada Trucking Co. v. Bd. of Water Supply, 97 Hawai‘ i 450, 
458, 40 P.3d 73, 81 (2002) ("Findings of fact . . . that are not 
challenged on appeal are binding on the appellate court.").  
Instead, Flores asserts this court "does not have jurisdiction 
to address the issue, and decision on appeal" and requests that 
we "remand to Disability Compensation Division (DCD) for issue of orders, and or decisions." 
Contrary to Flores' assertion, this court has 
appellate jurisdiction over his appeal pursuant to Hawaii 
Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 91-14(a) (2012), 386-88 (2015), and 
602-57(1) (2016).  See Bocalbos v. Kapiolani Med. Ctr. for Women  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
5 
   & Child., 89 Hawai‘ i 436, 439, 974 P.2d 1026, 1029 (1999) 
(explaining that HRS § 91–14(a), "the statute authorizing 
appeals in administrative agency cases[,]" governs "[t]he appeal 
of a decision or order of the LIRAB[,]" and "authorizes judicial 
review of 'a final decision and order in a contested case' or 'a 
preliminary ruling of the nature that deferral of review pending 
entry of a subsequent final decision would deprive appellant of adequate relief'"). 
Pursuant to HRS § 386-88, Flores timely appealed to 
this court "by filing a written notice of appeal" with LIRAB 
less than 30 days after LIRAB entered its December 7, 2020 
decision.  See HRS § 386-88.  Moreover, "though a lower court is 
found to have lacked jurisdiction, we have jurisdiction here on appeal, not of the merits, but for the purpose of correcting an 
error in jurisdiction."  Curtis v. Bd. of Appeals, Cnty. of 
Hawai‘i, 90 Hawai‘ i 384, 393, 978 P.2d 822, 831 (1999) (citation 
and internal quotation marks omitted).  Accordingly, this court has jurisdiction over this appeal. 
Given the record in this case, LIRAB correctly 
determined that it lacked jurisdiction over Flores' untimely appeal filed on January 6, 2020.  LIRAB thus properly dismissed NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 the appeal, and Flores established no grounds for remanding this 
matter to the Disability Compensation Division. 
  Based on the foregoing, we affirm LIRAB's December 7, 
2020 Decision and Order.
