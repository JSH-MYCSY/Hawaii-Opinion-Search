APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 3CC171000137) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears we lack appellate 
jurisdiction over self-represented Defendants-Appellants William 
Gaspar and Joyal Gaspar's (collectively, the Gaspars) appeal from 
the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit's (circuit court) 
December 16, 2020 "Order Denying [the Gaspars'] Motion to Dismiss 
[Plaintiff-Appellee Citibank, NA]'s Motion for Summary Judgment as Against All Defendants and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure, Filed December 15, 2017; and Motion to Dismiss Complaint filed April 21, 2017, Filed July 17, 2020" (Order 
Denying Motion to Dismiss), and December 28, 2020 minute order, 
issued in Civil No. 3CC171000137, because the circuit court has 
not entered an appealable, final judgment or order. 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (
HRS) § 641-1(a) (2016) 
provides that "[a]ppeals shall be allowed in civil matters from all final judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit . . . NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
courts[.]" Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the 
manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c) (2016). Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 58 requires 
that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." 
An aggrieved party typically cannot obtain appellate 
review of a circuit court's interlocutory orders in a civil case, under HRS § 641-1(a) (2016), until the circuit court has reduced its dispositive rulings to an appealable, final judgment under HRCP Rule 58 or Rule 54(b). See Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming 
& Wright, 76 Hawai# i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). Here, 
the circuit court has not yet entered an appealable, final judgment. 
Further, the Order Denying Motion to Dismiss does not 
qualify for an exception to the final-judgment requirement under the collateral-order doctrine, the Forgay doctrine, or HRS § 641-1(b) (2016). See Greer v. Baker, 137 Hawai# i 249, 253, 369 P.3d 
832, 836 (2016) (setting forth requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine and collateral-order doctrine); HRS § 641-1 (requirements for leave to file an interlocutory appeal). 
In addition, the circuit court's minute order is not 
appealable. See Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 
Hawai# i 319, 321 n.3, 966 P.2d 631, 633 n.3 (1998) ("[A] minute 
order is not an appealable order."). 
The court "must dismiss an appeal on our motion if we 
lack jurisdiction." Grattafiori v. State, 79 Hawai# i 10, 13, 897 
P.2d 937, 940 (1995) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, June 4, 2021.
