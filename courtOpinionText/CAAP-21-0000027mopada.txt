APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
WAILUKU DIVISION 
(CASE NO. 2DSS-20-0000144) 
  
MEMORANDUM OPINION 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.)
 
 
Respondents-Appellants Mary and James Basco 
(collectively, Bascos) appeal from the District Court of the 
Second Circuit's January 11, 2021 Order Granting Petition for 
Injunction Against Harassment and February 8, 2021 Order 
Regarding Attorneys' Fees and Costs.1 
On appeal, the Bascos challenge the district court's 
jurisdiction.  Relying on Hawai‘ i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 604-
10.5(g) (2016), the Bascos assert that the temporary restraining

 order in this case expired on August 30, 2020 and, thus, the 
district court "lacked jurisdiction to enter the Order Granting 
Petition for Injunction Against Harassment on January 11, 2021" 
and to award attorneys' fees and costs.  We affirm.2  
On June 1, 2020, the Petitioners-Appellees Kieu Meyer, 
Stephen Meyer, and Kieu Meyer on behalf of a minor 
(collectively, Meyers) petitioned the district court for, inter 
alia, (1) "[a]n ex parte temporary restraining order not to 
exceed a period of ninety (90) days . . ." and (2) "[a]n order 
of an Injunction not to exceed a period of three (3) 
years . . . ."  That same day, the district court granted the 
temporary restraining order against the Bascos "for fifteen (15) 
days, unless extended or terminated by the Court." 
The district court held a hearing on the Meyer's 
petition for injunction on June 15, 2020.  However, due to the contested nature of this case, further hearings were necessary, 
and were held on July 6, 2020, August 17, 2020, September 28, 
2020, December 7, 2020, and January 11, 2021.  Each order for 
continuance also ordered that the June 1, 2020 temporary 
restraining order shall remain in effect. 
                                                           
2   The Bascos do not challenge extensions to the temporary restraining 
order by the district court except to the extent it affected the district 
court's jurisdiction to issue the injunction against harassment on 
January 11, 2021, and to award fees and costs.  Given our analysis below, we 
need not address whether the temporary restraining order expired on August 30, 2020 (i.e., after 90 days) or whether orders related to the COVID-
19 pandemic extended the statutory time period.

 On December 28, 2020, after five hearings on the 
injunction petition, the Bascos filed a motion to dismiss 
asserting the district court no longer had jurisdiction to 
proceed because more than ninety days had passed since the issuance of the temporary restraining order.  The district court 
denied the motion to dismiss and granted the request to enjoin 
harassment on January 11, 2021. 
The Bascos' points of error on appeal require an 
interpretation of HRS § 604-10.5 (2016) to determine whether the 
alleged expiration of a temporary restraining order divests the 
district court of jurisdiction over a petition to enjoin.  We 
review questions of statutory interpretation and subject matter 
jurisdiction de novo. See Bhakta v. Cnty. of Maui, 109 Hawai‘ i 
198, 208, 124 P.3d 943, 953 (2005); Lingle v. Hawai‘ i Gov't Emps. 
Ass'n, AFSCME, Local 152, AFL-CIO, 107 Hawai‘ i 178, 183, 111 P.3d 
587, 592 (2005).   
"[D]istrict courts shall have the power to enjoin, 
prohibit, or temporarily restrain harassment" and "[a]ny person 
who has been subjected to harassment may petition the district 
court of the district in which the petitioner resides for a 
temporary restraining order and an injunction from further 
harassment."  HRS § 604-10.5(b), (c).   
"Upon petition to a district court under this section, 
the court may temporarily restrain the person or persons named 
in the petition from harassing the petitioner upon a NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
4 
 determination that there is probable cause to believe that a 
past act or acts of harassment have occurred . . . ."  HRS 
§ 604-10.5(f).  That temporary restraining order, however, 
"shall remain in effect at the discretion of the court for a 
period not to exceed ninety days from the date the order is 
granted."  HRS § 604-10.5(g). 
Once a petition for a temporary restraining order is 
granted, a hearing must then be held on the petition to enjoin 
within fifteen days or as set forth below: 
A hearing on the petition to enjoin harassment shall be 
held within fifteen days after the temporary restraining 
order is granted. If service of the temporary restraining 
order has not been effected before the date of the hearing 
on the petition to enjoin, the court may set a new date for 
the hearing; provided that the new date shall not exceed 
ninety days from the date the temporary restraining order 
was granted. 
 
HRS § 604-10.5(g).  "The parties named in the petition may file 
or give oral responses explaining, excusing, justifying, or 
denying the alleged act or acts of harassment."  HRS § 604-
10.5(g). 
Regarding the petition to enjoin, should the district 
court find by clear and convincing evidence harassment of 
"[p]hysical harm, bodily injury, assault, or the threat of 
imminent physical harm, bodily injury, or assault," "it may 
enjoin for no more than three years further harassment of the 
petitioner[.]"  HRS § 604-10.5(a), (g) (emphasis added).  Should 
the district court find by clear and convincing evidence 
harassment of "[a]n intentional or knowing course of conduct NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
5 
 directed at an individual that seriously alarms or disturbs 
consistently or continually bothers the individual and serves no 
legitimate purpose; provided that such course of conduct would 
cause a reasonable person to suffer emotional distress[,]" "it 
shall enjoin for no more than three years further harassment of 
the petitioner[.]"  HRS § 604-10.5(a), (g) (emphasis added).  
Restated, a petitioner makes two separate requests to 
the district court–a request for a temporary restraining order 
and a request to enjoin harassment (i.e., order for injunction).  
See HRS § 604-10.5(g).  The petition for a temporary restraining 
order may be granted on a finding of probable cause, and has a 
statutory time limit of ninety days.  HRS § 604-10.5(f), (g).   
For the petition to enjoin harassment, the district 
court must hold a hearing within fifteen days of granting the 
temporary restraining order, or within the time set forth in HRS 
§ 604-10.5(g).  Should the district court find harassment by 
clear and convincing evidence, it may or shall issue an order 
granting the petition to enjoin depending on the nature of the 
harassment.  HRS § 604-10.5(g).  That order has a statutory time 
limit of three years.  HRS § 604-10.5(g).    
HRS § 604-10.5(g), however, does not require that the 
district court decide the petition to enjoin harassment within 
ninety days of granting the temporary restraining order.  See 
Ling v. Yokoyama, 91 Hawai‘ i 131, 134, 980 P.2d 1005, 1008 
(App. 1999) (holding that with respect to the requirement that a NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
6 
 hearing be held within fifteen days, "the term 'held' suggests 
that the parties must, at the least, convene or meet in a 
hearing on the merits within the allotted time").  
Moreover, HRS § 604-10.5(g) does not have any language 
that indicates that the district court is divested of 
jurisdiction over the petition to enjoin harassment after a 
temporary restraining order expires.  See State v. Villados, 55 
Haw. 394, 397, 520 P.2d 427, 430 (1974) ("Because the divestiture of jurisdiction is a serious matter, before a party 
can claim that an act or statute has the effect of divesting 
jurisdiction which has regularly and fully vested, the law in 
favor of such divestment must be clear and unambiguous.")  
It appears that the purpose of the temporary 
restraining order is to protect the parties from imminent harm by providing a period of separation while the district court 
hears from the parties and decides whether to grant the petition 
to enjoin harassment.  See Hamilton ex rel. Lethem v. Lethem, 
126 Hawai‘ i 294, 305, 270 P.3d 1024, 1035 (2012) (discussing the 
purpose of HRS chapter 586 temporary restraining orders as to "provide emergency relief from imminent harm by assuring a 
period of separation for the parties involved").  
In sum, the petition for a temporary restraining order 
and the petition to enjoin are related, and are part of a two-
step process.  See HRS § 604-10.5(g).  Each petition, however, 
is a distinct legal vehicle for relief with different standards NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

  of proof.  See HRS § 604-10.5(f), (g).  Thus, the district 
court's jurisdiction over a petition to enjoin does not hinge on 
the status of the temporary restraining order. 
Finally, because the district court had jurisdiction 
over the petition to enjoin harassment, the district court also 
had jurisdiction over attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to HRS 
§ 604-10.5(h), which provides that "[t]he court may grant the 
prevailing party in an action brought under this section costs 
and fees, including attorney's fees."   
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the district court's 
January 11, 2021 Order Granting Petition for Injunction Against 
Harassment and February 8, 2021 Order Regarding Attorneys' Fees 
and Costs.
