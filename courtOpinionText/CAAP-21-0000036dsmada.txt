NO. CAAP-21-0000036
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
630 COOKE STREET PARTNERSHIP LP doing business as
NOHONA HALE, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
MERCEDEZ GONZALEZ, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
HONOLULU DIVISION
(CIVIL NO. 1DRC-20-0005164)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Nakasone, JJ.)
Upon consideration of the Motion for Clarification of
Notice of Appeal, which we construe as a motion to dismiss the
appeal, by Plaintiff-Appellee 630 Cooke Street Partnership LP
doing business as Nonoha Hale, the papers in support, and the
record here, CAAP-21-0000036, and in the underlying case, Civil
No. 1DRC-20-0005164, it appears we lack jurisdiction over the
appeal by self-represented Defendant-Appellant Mercedez Gonzalez
(Gonzalez) from Civil No. 1DRC-20-0005164 because the record for
the underlying case lacks an appealable, final judgment or
order.1
On January 27, 2021, after the District Court of the
First Circuit, Honolulu Division (district court) entered its
January 19, 2021 Judgment for Possession ( Judgment), it granted
Gonzalez's Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment or Dismissal
1  The court takes judicial notice of the record in the underlying case. 
See Hawai #i Rules of Evidence Rule 201.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(Motion to Set Aside ) and set aside the Judgment.  Absent an
appealable final judgment or order, the appeal is premature and
we lack appellate jurisdiction.  See Hawaii Revised Statutes
(HRS) ยง 641-1(a) (2016); Morneau v. Kaiser Found. Hospitals, 48
Haw. 534, 536, 404 P.2d 899, 900 (1965) ("If a new trial is
granted and the judgment consequently is set aside there is no
final judgment from which to appeal.") (citation omitted).   2
Once the district court enters a final, appealable
amended judgment or an appealable order, any aggrieved party may
obtain appellate review of it and any interlocutory order issued
in the case through a timely appeal.  See HRS ยง 641-1(a); Ueoka
v. Szymanski, 107 Hawai# i 386, 396, 114 P.3d 892, 902 (2005) ("An
appeal from a final judgment brings up for review all
interlocutory orders not appealable directly as of right which
deal with issues in the case.").
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal in
CAAP-21-0000036 is dismissed.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are
dismissed.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, May 21, 2021.

2  Gonzalez did not cite to authority for the Motion to Set Aside, but
it appears District Court Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 59 applies.
