APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(
CIVIL NO. 2CC021000352(2)) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
Defendant-Counterclaimant-Third-Party Plaintiff-
Appellant Michael J. Szymanski (Szymanski) appeals from the 
December 28, 2020 Final Judgment (Judgment) entered by the   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (Circuit Court)1 in favor of 
Defendant-Appellee Wailea Resort Company, Ltd. (Wailea) and 
Third-Party Defendants-Appellees ADOA-Shinwa Development 
Corporation, et al. (collectively, Appellees). Szymanski also 
challenges the Circuit Court's June 3, 2020 order, which addressed disbursal of escrow funds, pre-judgment interest, and other issues (June 3, 2020 Order), and September 14, 2020 order, 
which principally denied reconsideration of the June 3, 2020 
Order (September 14, 2020 Order). 
Szymanski raises four points of error on appeal, 
contending that the Circuit Court erred when it: 
(1) failed to 
hold an evidentiary hearing pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 636-16 (2016) to determine if and when Wailea breached 
the May 5, 1999 Land Sales Contract between Wailea and Szymanksi 
for the sale of property in 
Honua#ula, Maui (Land Contract); (2) 
"failed to hold a due-process evidentiary hearing to address 'the disbursal of [Szymanski's $50,000 NON-Contract] funds issued based on the Contract, as Amended,' which the supreme court explicitly remanded the Circuit Court to do;" (3) held that the 2003 stipulation to move the deposit of Szymanski's $50,000 deposit previously held by Title Guaranty from a non-interest bearing bank account into an interest-bearing bank account limited Szymanski's right to an evidentiary hearing and prejudgment interest; and (4) failed to address whether Alexander & Baldwin, Inc. (A&B) and its related entities are indispensable 
parties. 
1 The Honorable Peter T. Cahill presided. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve Szymanski's points of error as follows: 
This is the seventh appeal in Civil No. 02-1-0352. In 
2019, the Hawai# i Supreme Court held that this court erred in 
ruling that Wailea was entitled to retain the $50,000 deposit with accrued interest, vacated this court's judgment only as to the disbursal of escrow funds to Wailea, and remanded to the Circuit Court for further proceedings consistent with its opinion. Title Guar. Escrow Servs., Inc. v. Wailea Resort Co.
, 
146 Hawai#i 34, 48-49, 456 P.3d 107, 121-22 (2019). We consider 
this appeal in light of the supreme court's narrow mandate for further action on remand. 
The $50,000 in funds were disbursed to Szymanski. 
In 
fact, following remand, Wailea delivered (through counsel) a cashier's check in the amount of $52,110.87, which was the deposit amount and all accumulated interest. Szymanski refused to accept the tender, as he did not want to waive his argument that he was entitled to an award of prejudgment interest. 
(1) Szymanski contends that the Circuit Court erred in 
not holding an evidentiary hearing on whether Wailea breached the Land Contract, in furtherance of his argument regarding prejudgment interest. This argument is without merit. This court's April 27, 2009 decision determined that it was Szymanski who was in breach of the Land Contract on July 13, 2001, and the supreme court denied certiorari on that question. See Title 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Guar. Escrow Servs., Inc. v. Szymanski, No. 27254, 2009 WL 
1112604, *2 (Haw. App. Apr. 27, 2009) (SDO); Title Guar. Escrow Servs., Inc., 146 Hawai# i at 38-39, 456 P.3d at 111-12. Because 
this court made a final determination regarding Szymanski's breach, and the supreme court denied certiorari, the law of the case doctrine instructs this court not to disturb the ruling. 
The law of the case doctrine holds that "a 
determination of a question of law made by an appellate
court in the course of an action becomes the law of the case and may not be disputed by a reopening of the question at alater stage of the litigation." Fought & Co. v. Steel Eng'g& Erection, Inc., 87 Hawai #i 37, 48–49, 951 P.2d 487, 498–99
(1998) (citation omitted). 
"This doctrine applies to issues
that have been decided either expressly or by necessaryimplication." Id. In other words, "the usual practice ofcourts to refuse to disturb all prior rulings in aparticular case" is referred to as the "law of the case"doctrine. Chun v. Bd. of Trs. of the Emps.' Ret. Sys. ofState of Hawaii, 92 Hawai #i 432, 441, 992 P.2d 127, 136
(2000) (citations omitted). "Unless cogent reasons supportthe second court's action, any modification of a priorruling of another court of equal and concurrent jurisdictionwill be deemed an abuse of discretion." Wong v. City & Cty.of Honolulu, 66 Haw. 389, 396, 665 P.2d 157, 162 (1983)(emphasis omitted). 
Hussey v. Say, 139 Hawai#i 181, 185 384 P.3d 1282, 1286 (2016). 
Szymanski provides no cogent reason to disturb this court's prior 
determination that Szymanski, not Wailea, beached his obligations under the Land Contract. 
(2 & 3) Szymanski argues that the Circuit Court erred 
when it denied him an award of prejudgment interest, over and above the modest amount accrued in the interest-bearing account utilized per the parties' 2003 stipulation. Szymanski incorrectly asserts that the standard of review for a court's award or denial of prejudgment interest is de novo. It is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Amfac, Inc. v. Waikiki Beachcomber Inv. Co., 74 Haw. 85, 136-37, 839 P.2d 10, 36 (1992); 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Page v. Domino's Pizza, Inc., 80 Hawai# i 204, 208, 908 P.2d 552, 
556 (App. 1995). 
HRS § 636-16 provides: 
§ 636-16 Awarding Interest. In awarding interest in
civil cases, the judge is authorized to designate the
commencement date to conform with the circumstances of each case, provided that the earliest commencement date in casesarising in tort, may be the date when the injury firstoccurred and in cases arising by breach of contract, it maybe the date when the breach first occurred. 
"The well-established 'purpose of the statute [is] to 
allow the court to designate the commencement date of interest in 
order to correct injustice when a judgment is delayed for a long period of time for any reason, including litigation delays.'" Page
, 80 Hawai#i at 209, 908 P.2d at 557 (citation and ellipses 
omitted). "A trial court's denial of prejudgment interest is usually affirmed if the party requesting the award is found to have caused the delay . . . or if there is no showing that the non-moving party's 'conduct unduly delayed the proceedings' of the case." 
Id.(citations omitted). 
Here, the Circuit Court exercised its discretion not to 
award prejudgment interest because the parties stipulated to put the $50,000 deposit into a particular interest-bearing account, and no facts were presented to warrant the court's deviation from that agreement. 
Szymanski argues that the Circuit Court should have 
held an evidentiary hearing, but HRS § 636-16 does not require an evidentiary hearing prior to making a determination on prejudgment interest. Szymanski cites to Nordic PCL Constr., Inc. v. LPIHGC, LLC, 136 
Hawai#i 29, 358 P.3d 1 (2015), and Low 
v. Minichino, 126 Hawai# i 99, 267 P.3d 683 (App. 2011), for the 
proposition that when material facts are in dispute, the circuit 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
court should conduct an evidentiary hearing. However, these 
cases deal with arbitration disputes, not prejudgment interest, and there are no material facts in dispute here. 
Szymanski provides no support for the proposition that 
Wailea's conduct unduly delayed the proceedings in this case. Szymanski correctly points out that a finding of fault is not necessary before awarding a party prejudgment interest, citing Tri-S Corp. v. W. World Ins. Co.
, 110 Hawai#i 473, 498, 135 P.3d 
82, 107 (2006). However, upon full consideration of Szymanski's arguments and the entirety of the record, we cannot conclude that the Circuit Court abused its discretion in denying the award of prejudgment interest under the circumstances of this case. 
(4) Szymanski argues that the Circuit Court erred in 
failing to address the portion of his motion seeking to add A&B and its related entities as real parties in interest to ensure that he can collect what is owed to him. 
This argument is wholly 
without merit. Szymanski has been paid. Moreover, the Circuit Court did in fact address Szymanski's request when it denied his motion in its entirety. 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's December 28, 
2020 Judgment is affirmed.
