Upon consideration of the Motion to Dismiss for Lack of

Circuit Court ( Circuit Court) has not entered a final, appealable
order or judgment and the appeal is premature.
Wilborn appears to appeal from the Circuit Court's
September 17, 2020 Order Denying Without Hearing "Motion to Quash
Mental Examination to Determine [Wilborn's] Fitness to Proceed
and Penal Responsibility" Filed September 16, 2020, and
September 21, 2020 bench warrant.  "In a circuit court criminal
case, a defendant may appeal from the judgment of the circuit
court, see [Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS )] ยง 641-11 (1993), from
a certified interlocutory order, see HRS ยง 641-17 (1993), or from
an interlocutory order denying a motion to dismiss based on
double jeopardy."  State v. Kealaiki, 95 Hawai#i 309, 312, 22NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
P.3d 588, 591 (2001) (citation omitted).  Here, the Circuit Court
has not certified its rulings for interlocutory appeal under HRS
ยง 641-17 (2016) or denied a motion to dismiss based on double
jeopardy.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is
granted and the appeal in Case No. CAAP-21-0000044 is dismissed
for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions
are dismissed as moot.
