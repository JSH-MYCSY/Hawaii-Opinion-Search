Plaintiff/Counterclaim Defendant -Appellant Harbor

2020 (Attorney 's Fees Order ), (3) August 2, 2021 Order Granting 
[Jasper Properties'] Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as to 
Counts I and II Filed June 7, 2021 (Summary Judgment Order ), and 
(4) August 25, 2021 Judgment (Judgment ), all entered by the 
Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit ( circuit court ). 1 
This case involves a driveway that is located on, and 
"straddl ing the property line[,]" of adjacent properties owned 
by Harbor Mall and Jasper Properties. The summary judgment 
record reflects that Jasper Properties acquired its property in 
2003, and that Harbor Mall and Jasper Properties executed a 
handwritten 2003 contract ( the 2003 Agreement ) that purports to 
memorialize an agreement to share the cost of improvements to 
the driveway. Although the parties did not fulfill the terms of 
the 2003 Agreement due to the prohibitive cost, it appears that 
Harbor Mall continued to utilize the entire driveway, including 
the portion located on Jasper Properties' land, until Jasper 
Properties erected barriers in 2019 that prevented Harbor Mall 
from accessing the portion of the driveway located on Jasper 
Properties' land. It appears that Harbor Mall arranged for the 
paving of the shared driveway after the 2003 Agreement was 
signed and prior to Jasper Properties ' erecting of barriers in 
2019.

In October 2020, Harbor Mall filed its operative First 
Amended Complaint ( FAC) against Jasper Properties , seeking 
damages as well as injunctive and declaratory relief. The FAC 
sets forth three counts , contending that Jasper Properties 
wrongly restricted its access to the entire driveway, and 
alleging breach of contract, promissory estoppel, and unjust 
enrichment. 
Jasper Properties subsequently moved for summary 
judgment on Harbor Mall's breach of contract and promissory 
estoppel claims. The circuit court heard the motion, granted 
summary judgment in favor of Jasper Properties, and entered a 
Hawaiʻi Rules of Civil Procedure ( HRCP) Rule 54(b) Judgment on 
Counts I and II. Harbor Mall appealed from the Judgment . 
On appeal, Harbor Mall raises the following points of 
error, contending that the circuit court erred in: (1) awarding 
Jasper Properties attorney's fees;2 (2) granting summary judgment 
in favor of Jasper Properties and against Harbor Mall on Count I 
(breach of contract) of Harbor Mall's FAC ; (3) granting summary 
judgment in favor of Jasper Properties and against Harbor Mall 
on Count II (promissory estoppel) of Harbor Mall's F AC; and (4) 
2 Harbor Mall raises this point of error in CAAP -21-0000046 and 
CAAP-21-0000209. Briefing on this point of error was filed in CAAP -21-
0000209.

denying Harbor Mall's request for an extension of time in which 
to conduct discovery pursuant to HRCP Rule 56(f).3 
Upon careful review of the record and relevant legal 
authorities, and having given due consideration to the arguments 
advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve Harbor 
Mall's points of error as follows: 
(1) Harbor Mall contends that the circuit court erred 
by awarding Jasper Properties attorney's fees, in the amount of 
$6,471.20 , as the prevailing party with regard to the 
Expungement Order . 4 We review the circuit court's Attorney's 
Fees Order for abuse of discretion. Kamaka v. Goodsill Anderson 
Quinn & Stifel , 117 Hawaiʻi 92, 105, 176 P.3d 91, 104 (2008).  
In Price v. AIG Hawai ʻi Ins. Co., 107 Hawaiʻi 106, 
111  P.3d 1 (2005), the Hawai ʻi Supreme Court noted,  
We take this opportunity to remind all judges to specify 
the grounds for awards of attorneys' fees and the amounts 
awarded with respect to each ground. Without such an 
explanation, we must vacate and remand awards for 
redetermination and/or clarification .  
Id. at 113, 111 P.3d at 8 (citations omitted). 
3 Harbor Mall raises the points of error referenced in (2 ), (3), 
and (4) in CAAP-21-0000415 and CAAP -21-0000477. Briefing on these points of 
error was filed in CAAP -21-0000477. 
In March 2020, Harbor Mall filed a Notice of Pendency of Action 
(NOPA), or lis pendens . Jasper Properties moved for expungement of the NOPA ; 
the circuit court granted Jasper Properties' motion and Attorney 's Fees 
Order. Harbor Mall appealed the attorney's fees award in CAAP-21-0000046 and 
CAAP-21-0000209. "An order awarding attorney fees is an appealable 
collateral order." Nakata v. Nakata , 7 Haw. App. 636, 636, 793 P.2d 1219, 
1220 (1990).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In Erum v. Llego,  147 Hawaiʻi  368, 465  P.3d 815 (2020),   
the Hawaiʻ i Supreme Court further explained  that,  
. . . [T]his court has recommended that orders imposing 
sanctions in other contexts "set forth find ings that 
describe, with reasonable specificity, the perceived misconduct (such as harassment or bad faith conduct), as well as the appropriate sanctioning authority (e.g., HRCP 
Rule 11 or the court's inherent power)." Bank of Hawaii v. 
Kunimoto, 91 
Hawaiʻi 372, 390, 984 P.2d 1198, 1216 (1999). 
When an order imposing sanctions does not follow this 
recommendation, the appellate court is compelled to review 
the entire record for an abuse of discretion. Fujimoto v. 
Au, 95 Hawai ʻi 116, 153, 19 P.3d 699, 736 (2001). However, 
we have stated that specific findings must be made in cases 
when it is warranted. See, e.g., Tagupa v. VIPDesk, 135 
Hawaiʻi 468, 479, 353 P.3d 1010, 1021 (2015) (stating that 
prior to a statutory award of attorneys' fees for a 
frivolous claim, the court must make a specific finding that all or a portion of the claims made by a party are 
frivolous); Fujimoto, 95 Hawaiʻ i at 153, 19 P.3d at 736 
("Absent a particularized finding of bad faith, the circuit 
court abused its discretion in sanctioning the 
plaintiffs."); Kunimoto, 91 Hawai ʻi at 389, 984 P.2d at 1215 
("It is well settled that a court may not invoke its 
inherent powers to sanction an attorney without a specific 
finding of bad faith."); Kawamata Farms, Inc. v. United 
Agri Prods., 86 Hawaiʻ i 214, 258, 948 P.2d  1055, 1099 (1997) 
(affirming the circuit court's award of attorneys' fees 
because the court issued findings describing defendant's 
discovery violations in detail).  
We have also stated that specific findings that describe the perceived misconduct serve multiple important purposes. 
Enos, 79 Hawai ʻi at 459, 903 P.2d at 1280. First, findings 
permit a more meaningful and efficient appellate review as 
to whether "the trial court exercised its discretion in a reasoned and principled fashion." Id.   Second, findings 
assure the litigants, as well as the court, "that the decision was the product of thoughtful deliberation." Id.   
Finally, findings clearly identify and explain  to the 
sanctioned person the conduct underlying the sanction.  
Id. at 389 -90, 465 P.3d at 836 -37. 
The  circuit court did not explain the grounds for its 
fees award, as Price  and Erum  require.   The circuit court did 
not cite any legal authority that provided the basis for the 
fees award.   Moreover, the circuit court  reduced the amount of 
6   
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
    
   
 
 
  
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
attorney's fees from the $ 8,732.98  requested to "$6,471.20  (20.6 
hours x $300/hr plus GET) ." In doing so, the circuit court did 
not further explain its rationale for the re duced fees , nor did 
it make any finding that the reduced amount was reasonable. On 
this record, we cannot effectively review whether the circuit 
court abused its discretion in its award of attorney's fees to 
Jasper Properties. 
We vacate the circuit court's Attorney's Fees Order , 
as well as the portion of the Expungement Order that , without 
further explanation, awards Jasper Properties "reasonable 
attorney's fees and costs incurred to bring the [expung ement] 
Motion[,]" and remand for an explanation as to the grounds for 
awarding fees and the determination of a reasonable fees award 
in compliance with Price and Erum's instructions. 
(2) Harbor Mall contends that the circuit court erred 
by granting Jasper Properties' motion for partial summary 
judgment on Counts I and II of the FAC. The circuit court 
granted summary judgment, concluding that there was no genuine 
issue of material fact with respect to Harbor Mall's contentions 
of "breach of contract" or "promissory estoppel." 
"On appeal, the grant or denial of summary judgment is 
reviewed de novo." Ralston v. Yim , 129 Hawaiʻi 46, 55, 292 P.3d 
1276, 1285 (2013) (citations omitted). The court applies the 
following standard, 
7   
 
 
  
  
  
 
     
  
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
[S]ummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, 
depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on 
file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there 
is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the 
moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. A 
fact is material if proof of that fact would have the effect of establishing or refuting one of the essential 
elements of a cause of action or defense asserted by the 
parties. The evidence must be viewed in the light most 
favorable to the non -moving party. In other words, we must 
view all of the evidence and inferences drawn therefrom in 
the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion
.  
Id. at 55-56, 292 P.3d at 1285 -86. 
"[A] summary judgment movant may satisfy [their] 
initial burden of production by either (1) presenting evidence 
negating an element of the non -movant's claim, or (2) 
demonstrating that the nonmovant will be unable to carry [their] 
burden of proof at trial ." Id. at 60, 292 P.3d at 1290 . The 
burden then shift s to the respondent to establish that there is 
a genuine question of material fact for trial. Id. at 57, 292 
P.3d at 1287. 
"Implied contracts arise under circumstances which, 
according to the ordinary course of dealing and the common 
understanding of men, show a mutual intention to contract." 
Durette  v. Aloha Plastic Recycling, Inc., 105 Hawaiʻi 490,  504, 
100 P.3d 60,  74 (2004) (citation omitted). "An implied 
contract, in the proper sense, is where the intention of the 
parties is not expressed, but an agreement in fact, creating an 
obligation, is implied or presumed from their acts . . . ." Id.

In order to establish promissory estoppel, 
(1) There must be a promise; 
(2) The promisor must, at the time he or she made the promise, 
foresee that the promise e would rely upon the promise 
(foreseeability); 
(3) The promise e does in fact rely upon the promisor's promise; 
and 
(4) Enforcement of the promise is necessary to avoid injustice. 
Applications of Herrick, 82 Hawaiʻi 329, 337-38, 922 P.2d 942, 
950-51 (1996) (citing Restatement (Second) of Contracts  §  90 
(Am. L. Inst. 1979))  (cleaned up).  
Generally , a claim for promissory estoppel may arise as an 
application of the general principle of equitable estoppel 
to certain situations where a promise has been made, even 
though without consideration, if it was intended that the 
promise be relied upon and was i n fact relied upon, and a 
refusal to enforce it would be virtually to sanction the 
perpetration of fraud or result in other injustice. 
Gonsalves v. Nissan Motor  Corp.  in Hawaii,  Ltd.,  100 Hawaiʻi  149, 
164, 58 P.3d 1196, 1211  (2002) (citation omitted).  
Harbor Mall provided evidence, in the form of Richard 
Jasper's5 deposition testimony, of his belief that Harbor Mall 
and Jasper Properties were "sharing" the driveway "in 
perpetuity." Pursuant to this understanding , the summary 
judgment record reflects that the parties had entered into the 
2003 Agreement to share the cost of improvements to the 
driveway. The summary judgment record further reflects that 
5 Richard Jasper testified that he signed the 2003 Agreement on 
behalf of Jasper Properties. He also testified to being the "member manager" 
of Jasper Properties.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Harbor Mall had been accessing Jasper Properties' portion of the 
driveway for years, and had been responsible for the paving of 
the driveway . We conclude that Harbor Mall raised a genuine 
question of material fact, at the summary judgment stage, as to 
whether there existed a mutual agreement and/or promise pursuant 
to which Harbor Mall had a legal or equitable right to access 
the portions of the driveway that "straddled" Jasper Properties' 
land, 6 such that Harbor Mall might be able to establish a claim 
to some form of damages and/or equitable relief. 
The circuit court erred in granting summary judgment 
on Counts I and II of Harbor Mall's FAC . 
(3) In light of our decision, as explained in section 
(2), supra, we need not reach Harbor Mall's contention that the 
circuit court erred in denying its request, pursuant to HRCP 
Rule 56(f), for additional time to conduct discovery at the 
summary judgment stage . 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the circuit 
court's Attorney's Fees Order, Summary Judgment Order, and 
Judgment. We further vacate the portion of the Expungement 
Order that , without further explanation, awards Jasper 
Properties "reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred to 
6 Harbor Mall characterizes this alleged legal or equitable right 
variously as, or akin to, an "easement by estoppel," "irrevocable license," 
"implied easement," "equitable servitude," and "servitude created by 
estoppel."
