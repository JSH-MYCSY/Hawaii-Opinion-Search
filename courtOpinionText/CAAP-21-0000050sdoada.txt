APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 3CC051000210) 
  
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and McCullen, JJ.) 
Self-represented Defendants-Appellants Dan Perkins,  
Linda M. Wagner, and Walter L. Wagner (together, Appellants)  
appeal from the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit's 
(1) December 22, 2020 "Amended Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion 
to Extend First Amended Final Judgment Entered on 9/28/2009 
Pursuant to [Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes (HRS)] §657-5" (Amended 1 
1 On December 9, 2024, self- represented Defendant- Appellant Walter L. 
Wagner filed a "Notice of Passing[,]" informing the court that self-
represented Defendant- Appellant Dan Perkins passed away on December 5, 2024.

Extension Order);  (2) November 24, 2020 "Minute Order Denying 
Defendants' Letter Seeking to Vacate Nunc Pro Tunc Order of 
February 29, 2020 Filed October 8, 2020" (Minute Order); and 
(3) March 2, 2020 "Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion to Extend 
First Amended Final Judgment Entered on 9/28/2009 Pursuant to 
HRS §657-5" (Extension Order).  2
We lack jurisdiction to review the March 2, 2020 
Extension Order. The Extension Order was an appealable post-judgment order because it ended proceedings on Plaintiff-
Appellee World Botanical Gardens, Incorporated's motion to 
extend the First Amended Final Judgment, leaving nothing further 
to be accomplished. Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 Hawai‘ i 153, 157, 80 
P.3d 974, 978 (2003). 
Appellants' notice of appeal was filed on 
January 19, 2021, after the deadline set by Hawai‘ i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure Rule 4. The November 24, 2020 Minute Order 
is not an appealable order. See Abrams v. Cades, Schutte,
Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai‘ i 319, 321 n.3, 966 P.2d 631, 633 n.3 
(1998) (stating "a minute order is not an appealable order"). 
Our review is limited to Appellants' challenges to the 
December 22, 2020 Amended Extension Order. 
On February 25, 2009, the circuit court entered a 
judgment in favor of World Botanical and against Appellants. 
2 The Honorable Peter K. Kubota presided over the Amended Extension 
Order and Minute Order. The Honorable Jeffrey A. Hawk presided over the 
Extension Order.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Appellants refer to this as the "first-in-time" judgment. 
Appellants appealed, and this court dismissed for lack of 
jurisdiction because the first-in-time judgment was not a final 
appealable judgment. World Botanical Gardens, Inc. v. Wagner, 
No. 29739, 2009 WL 2480849 (App. Aug. 12, 2009) (Order). 
On September 28, 2009, the circuit court entered a 
First Amended Final Judgment (First Amended Judgment) in favor of World Botanical and against Appellants, which was affirmed on 
appeal. World Botanical Gardens, Inc. v. Wagner
, 126 Hawai‘i 24, 
265 P.3d 493, No. 30133, 2011 WL 4375083 (App. Sept. 20, 2011) 
(SDO), 
cert. rejected, No. SCWC-30133, 2011 WL 6067323 (Haw. 
Dec. 6, 2011). Almost ten years later, on September 5, 2019, 
World Botanical moved to extend the September 28, 2009 First 
Amended Judgment, and Appellants opposed the motion. The 
circuit court granted the motion, entering its Extension Order 
on March 2, 2020. Appellants did not appeal the Extension 
Order. 
Seven months after the Extension Order was entered, 
Appellants filed a document they labeled as a non-hearing "Motion to Vacate Nunc Pro Tunc Order of February 29, 2020 
[Hawai‘i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP)] Rule 60(B)" (Rule 60(b) 
Motion). (Internal brackets omitted.) 
In the Minute Order, the circuit court noted Walter 
and Linda were designated vexatious litigants, prohibiting them 
3   
 
  
 
   
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
from filing motions without "express authority from the 
[p]residing [j]udge." The circuit court also indicated it would 
accept the Rule 60(b) Motion, and then denied the Rule 60(b) 
Motion. The Minute Order nonetheless instructed World Botanical 
to submit an amended order excluding Linda from the extended 
judgment.3 
The circuit court then entered the Amended Extension 
Order, adding language that the extension was "only as to Defendants Walter Wagner and Dan Perkins, and Defendant Linda 
Wagner is hereby excluded from the scope of the extension of 
judgment." The Amended Extension Order noted the circuit court 
denied Appellants' Rule 60(b) Motion in its Minute Order. 
Appellants appealed, raising six points of error. Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve this 
appeal as discussed below, and affirm. 
A denial of an HRCP Rule 60(b) motion is reviewed for 
an abuse of discretion. James B. Nutter & Co. v. Namahoe
, 153 
Hawai‘i 149, 161, 528 P.3d 222, 234 (2023). "The burden of 
establishing abuse of discretion in denying a HRCP Rule 60(b) 
3 As part of her September 19, 2019 affidavit in opposition to the 
motion to extend, Linda submitted a copy of a January 20, 2011 dated 
bankruptcy discharge she received from the United States Bankruptcy Court for 
the District of Utah.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
motion is on the appellant, and a strong showing is required to 
establish it." Id. at 162, 528 P.3d at 235 (cleaned up). But 
"under HRCP Rule 60(b)(4), an order is void only if the court that rendered it lacked jurisdiction of either the subject 
matter or the parties or otherwise acted in a manner 
inconsistent with due process of law." Id. (cleaned up). "As 
such, a denial of a HRCP Rule 60(b)(4) motion is reviewed de novo." Id.
(1)  In their first point of error, Appellants appear 
to contend World Botanical lacked standing to extend the judgment. 
Appellants' Rule 60(b) Motion did not raise this 
issue, and thus, this point is waived. 
See Ass'n of Apartment
Owners of Wailea Elua v. Wailea Resort Co., 100 Hawai‘ i 97, 107, 
58 P.3d 608, 618 (2002) ("Legal issues not raised in the trial 
court are ordinarily deemed waived on appeal."). 
(2)  In their second point of error, Appellants appear 
to argue that World Botanical's counsel, Thomas Yeh, lacked 
standing to represent it. Appellants do not specify the subpart of HRCP Rule 60(b) on which they rely. 
In their opening brief, Appellants note the "error is 
detailed in the referenced affidavit, ROA #496[.]" 
Walter's 
affidavit, located at 3CC051000210 Docket 496, makes unsubstantiated assertions. Appellants' opening brief provides 
5   
 
  
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
no legal authority (other than authority defining "interim 
trustee" as used in the United States Bankruptcy Code) or record 
citations to support their argument. 
In their Rule 60(b) Motion, Appellants argued World 
Botanical was dissolved in 2014 and Yeh was not "appointed by 
anyone of authority to represent" it. And, their Rule 60(b) 
Motion cited only a 2011 opinion in one of Walter's prior 
appeals. Appellants presented no evidence to support their contention that World Botanical was dissolved. 
Under these circumstances, the circuit court acted 
within its discretion by denying the Rule 60(b) Motion. 
(3) In their third and fourth points of error, 
Appellants contend the judgment "could not legally be extended, 
because the Hawai‘ i extension statute requires that the extension 
be entered within 10 years of entry of the original judgment." 
Appellants appear to argue that the extension orders are void 
because the motion to extend was not filed within ten years of 
the February 25, 2009 first-in-time judgment (which was not a 
final judgment) and the Extension Order was not entered before the tenth anniversary of the September 28, 2009 First Amended 
Judgment. 
Appellants again do not specify the subpart of HRCP 
Rule 60(b) on which they rely. 
6   
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
We construe Appellants' point of error as relying on 
HRCP Rule 60(b)(4) ("the judgment is void"). Voiding a judgment 
pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b)(4) is limited to judgments rendered 
where the court "lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter, or 
of the parties, or if it acted in a manner inconsistent with due 
process of law." Bank of Hawaii v. Shinn, 120 Hawaiʻ i 1, 13, 200 
P.3d 370, 382 (2008) (cleaned up). 
HRS § 657-5 (2016) provides in part that "[n]o 
extension of a judgment or decree shall be granted unless the 
extension is sought within ten years of the date of the original
judgment or decree." 
(Emphases added.) The Hawai‘i Supreme 
Court has clarified "that [the] 'original judgment' of HRS 
§ 657-5 pertains to the judgment that creates the rights and 
responsibilities that the moving party is seeking to enforce and 
extend." Est. of Roxas v. Marcos
, 121 Hawai‘i 59, 71, 214 P.3d 
598, 610 (2009). 
This court dismissed Appellants' first appeal for lack 
of jurisdiction and the circuit court entered the September 28, 
2009 First Amended Judgment to satisfy the requirements for an 
appealable final judgment. 
As a result, the September 28, 2009 
First Amended Judgment created the rights and responsibilities World Botanical wanted to enforce and extend. See Marcos
, 121 
Hawai‘i at 71, 214 P.3d at 610; HRCP Rule 54(a). 
7   
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Moreover, HRS § 657-5 speaks to when the extension 
must be "sought[,]" not when the extension order must be 
"entered." Here, World Botanical filed its motion to extend the 
First Amended Judgment on September 5, 2019, within ten years 
after entry of the September 28, 2009 First Amended Judgment.  
Thus, the circuit court had jurisdiction over the 
matter, and did not err in denying Appellants' Rule 60(b) 
Motion. 
(4) In their fifth point of error, Appellants assert 
the First Amended Judgment "was obtained by fraud and is not reflective of the actual facts." 
Appellants again do not specify the subpart of HRCP 
Rule 60(b) on which they rely. 
To the extent Appellants' point of error relies on 
HRCP Rule 60(b)(3) ("fraud[,] misrepresentation, or other 
misconduct of an adverse party"), an HRCP Rule 60(b)(3) motion 
must be made "not more than one year after the judgment, order, or proceeding was entered or taken." Here, the First Amended 
Judgment was entered over ten years before their Rule 60(b) 
Motion. Thus, an HRCP Rule 60(b)(3) motion would be untimely. 
To the extent Appellants' point of error relies on 
HRCP Rule 60(b)(4) ("the judgment is void"), they argue they 
were denied due process because of the alleged false criminal 
charges, which resulted in Linda and Walter's absence from the 
8   
 
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
civil trial. Basic elements of due process are "notice and an 
opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful 
manner." Davis v. Bissen
, 154 Hawaiʻi 68, 82, 545 P.3d 557, 571 
(2024) (citation omitted). 
Other than their own affidavits, Appellants do not 
point to any evidence in the record to corroborate their claims 
of fraud. See Hawaii's Thousand Friends v. Anderson
, 70 Haw. 
276, 286, 768 P.2d 1293, 1300-01 (1989); cf. State v. Scotland, 58 Haw. 474, 477, 572 P.2d 497, 499 (1977) (explaining if 
incompetent evidence is received by the grand jury, indictment 
should be dismissed only if the testimony clearly appears to 
have improperly influenced the grand jurors despite the presence of sufficient evidence amounting to probable cause). 
And even accepting Appellants' allegation that 
perjured testimony was presented to the grand jury to indict 
Linda, whom they deemed a key witness, Appellants made no 
showing that they requested and were denied a continuance of the 
civil trial. Appellants also do not challenge the circuit 
court's findings that after Linda was arrested, they did not request a continuance of the civil trial. 
Thus, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion 
or err in denying the Rule 60(b) Motion. 
(5) Finally, in their sixth point of error, 
Appellants challenge the circuit court's use of "NUNC PRO TUNC" 
9   
 
   
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
in the Extension Order. As we explained, we do not have 
jurisdiction to review the Extension Order. Even if we did, the 
Amended Extension Order replaced the Extension Order so 
Appellants' challenge to the Extension Order would be moot. 
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the December 22, 
2020 Amended Extension Order.
