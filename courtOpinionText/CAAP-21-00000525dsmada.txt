APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 1CC121002843) 
ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and McCullen, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of the Stipulation for Dismissal 
With Prejudice (Stipulation), filed February 24, 2022, by 
Plaintiff-Appellee Wilmington Trust, National Association, not in
Its Individual Capacity but Solely in Its Capacity as Trustee of MFRA Trust 2015-1, the papers in support, and the record, it appears that:  
(1)
 the appeal has been docketed; 
(2) the parties stipulate to dismiss the appeal with 
prejudice; 
(3) the Stipulation is dated and signed by counsel for 
all parties appearing in the appeal; 
(4) the record reflects that appellate filing fees were 
paid; NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(5) the Stipulation does not specify the terms as to 
payment of costs, as set forth in Hawai# i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 42(b); and 
(6) because the requirements for a stipulation under 
HRAP Rule 42(b) have not been met, we construe the Stipulation as 
a motion under HRAP Rule 42(b). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion to 
dismiss is granted and the appeal is dismissed with prejudice. 
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, March 10, 2022.
