DAVID TARAN and RANDY TARAN, Plaintiffs-Appellants,
v. 
RAYMOND L. LAGGER, an individual, Defendant-Appellee,

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 3CC19100005K) 
ORDER 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
Upon review of "Defendant/Appellee Raymond L. Lagger's 
Motion for Reconsideration of the Summary Disposition Order, 
Filed October 11, 2024," filed on October 18, 2024, the papers in 
support, and the record, it appears that: 
1. The Motion recognizes that "[t]he only issue upon 
which summary judgment was granted below involved a question of law â€” whether the language . . . of the Master Declaration is ambiguous" and argues we didn't "decide that legal question"; 
2. Lagger argued the Master Declaration was ambiguous 
because it "does not define what constitutes an unreasonable 
obstruction" (emphasis added); and 
3. We concluded the lack of a definition "doesn't 
make the phrase unreasonably obstruct the view  ambiguous.

circuit court erred by granting Lagger's motion for summary 
judgment on that basis." 
Lagger's Motion presents no point of law or fact we 
overlooked or misapprehended. See Rule 40(b), Hawai #i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is 
denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai #i, October 23, 2024.
