APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 3CC19100005K) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
David Taran and Randy Taran (the Tarans) sued 
Raymond L. Lagger for unreasonably obstructing the view from 
their lot in Hualalai at Historic Ka #upulehu, in violation of the 
subdivision's Master Declaration  of Protective Covenants, 
Conditions and Restrictions and Reservation of Easements . The 
Tarans appeal from the Final Judgment for Lagger entered by the 
Circuit Court of the Third Circuit on January 20, 2021.
1 They 
challenge the November 20, 2020 order denying their motion for summary judgment and granting Lagger's motion for summary judgment; the December 21 2020 order denying their motion for reconsideration; and the December 30, 2020 order granting 
1 The Honorable Wendy M. DeWeese presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Lagger's motion for attorneys fees and costs. We vacate and 
remand for further proceedings. 
The circuit court denied the Tarans' motion for summary 
judgment and granted Lagger's motion for summary judgment on November 20, 2020. The court concluded that the Declaration's view restriction provision was ambiguous and unenforceable. The court didn't rule on the other issues raised by the motions. 
The Declaration's Article VI is titled Use 
Restrictions . Paragraph 2.7 states: 
2.7 View Restrictions. Subject to the provisions of
Article IX hereof,[2] no vegetation . . . sha11 be planted,
constructed, or maintained on any Lot . . . in such location
or of such height as to unreasonably obstruct the view  from 
any other Lot . . . . Each Owner, by accepting a deed to aLot or Condominium, hereby acknowledges that anyconstruction or installation by Declarant or a Developer mayimpair the view of such Owner, and hereby consents to suchimpairment. 
(Emphasis added.) 
The supreme court interpreted a similar restrictive 
covenant in Gailliard v. Rawsthorne, 150 Hawai #i 169, 498 P.3d 
700 (2021). The restrictive covenant in that case stated: 
Trees/Shrubs: Trees, shrubs, bushes, hedges and all otherplants on every lot shall be maintained at a reasonableheight so as not to interfere with the viewplanes [sic]available to any other lot. 
Id. at 172, 498 P.3d at 703. Relying on Hiner v. Hoffman, 90 
Hawai#i 188, 977 P.2d 878 (1999), Rawsthorne argued the phrase 
"reasonable height" was "ambiguous without a specific numerical measurement." Gailliard
, 150 Hawai #i at 179, 498 P.3d at 710. 
The supreme court distinguished Hiner, in which the phrase "two stories in height" was held to be ambiguous because not all two-story homes are the same height; without a numerical measurement of what "exceeds" the permissible height limit, the covenant was unenforceable. Id.  The supreme court held the "reasonable height" restriction in Gailliard was not ambiguous because: 
2 Article IX is titled Declarant's Rights and Exemptions . 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
[A] mechanical rule requiring that plants meet a specified
numerical height would be ineffective in carrying out theintent of the Covenant. For example, a fifteen-foot heightlimit might protect the view planes of some lots while notadequately protecting the view planes of others.Additionally, a numerical height limit might have theadverse effect of allowing lot owners whose views are notimpeded by their neighbors' plants to nonetheless require
the "offending" neighbors trim their plants merely for
exceeding the limit. 
Id. 
That reasoning applies here. The Declaration requires 
that owners plant and maintain their vegetation so it doesn't 
unreasonably obstruct the view from another lot. Lagger argues the restriction is ambiguous because it "does not define what constitutes an unreasonable obstruction." What is "reasonable" depends on the facts and circumstances of the case. See Flint v. MacKenzie, 53 Haw. 626, 628, 500 P.2d 556, 558 (1972) (stating that "what is 'a reasonable time' depends on the facts and circumstances of the particular case"). What is reasonable under the facts and circumstances is generally a question of fact. Id. at 633, 500 P.2d at 560 (Abe, J., concurring). For example, under paragraph 2.7, homeowners consent to developer-installed landscaping impairing their view. The Tarans' view being impaired by developer-installed landscaping may be a circumstance material to whether Lagger's landscaping unreasonably obstructs their view. The determination may require a site visit by the trier of fact, as in Gaillard, 150 Hawai #i at 179, 498 P.3d at 
710. That doesn't make the phrase unreasonably obstruct the view 
ambiguous. The circuit court erred by granting Lagger's motion for summary judgment on that basis. 
We express no opinion on the merits of the parties' 
other arguments, on which the circuit court did not rule. 
Because Lagger is no longer the prevailing party, we 
vacate the award of attorneys fees and costs. Ass'n of Owners of Kalele Kai v. Yoshikawa, 149 
Hawai#i 417, 421, 493 P.3d 939, 943
