Petitioner-Appellant AC (Father
) appeals from: (1)
 the 
"Order and Judgment Against [Father] re Attorney's Fees and Costs 
Awarded per Order re [Mother]'s Motions Filed on 9/24/2020 and 
10/2/2020, Filed on 11/17/2020" entered by the Family Court of the Third Circuit on November 23, 2020; and (2) the "Order

1 For 
the reasons explained below, we vacate the November 23, 2020 Order and Judgment, vacate the January 14, 2021 Reconsideration Order in part, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this memorandum opinion. 
1 The Honorable Cynthia T. Tai presided.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Background 
Father and Respondent-Appellee AC (Mother) were never 
married. They filed for nine orders of protection against each 
other during the course of their acrimonious relationship. They have two children, AJ (born in 2013) and AZ (born in 2014) 
(collectively, the Children). 
In 2015 Father filed a "Complaint for Custody, Child 
Support and Visitation[.]" In March 2016 the family court approved and entered a "Stipulation re Complaint for Custody, 
Child Support and Visitation[.]" Father (who lives on Hawai# i 
Island) and Mother (who lived in Montana at the time) agreed to 
joint legal custody of Children. Mother received "primary physical custody of the children subject to Father's reasonable visitations[.]" 
There was no provision for child support. 
In April 2019 Father filed a motion for relief from the 
Stipulation (Father's Motion for Relief). 
He sought sole 
physical custody of Children (then ages six and four) subject to Mother's right of visitation, and child support. 
On January 23, 2020, the family court orally ordered 
Father to pay temporary child support of $1,166 per month beginning January 2020.
2 The January payment was due at the end 
of the month. The February payment was due on February 10, 2020. The family court did not set deadlines for payments after February 2020; the hearing minutes indicate the court "will determine child support retroactive to the date [Father's] motion was filed." 
On March 24, 2020, the family court entered findings of 
fact, conclusions of law, and an order on Father's Motion for Relief. The family court found and concluded that it was in Children's best interest that Father and Mother continue to share joint legal custody. Primary physical custody with Mother was

family court, but the oral order is reflected in the family court's minutes.

continued, subject to Father's right to secondary physical 
custody. 
As to child support, the family court ordered Father to 
pay $1,080 per month retroactive to July 1, 2019.3 As of March 
2020, Father owed ($1,080 x 9 months) $9,720. Because the family 
court previously ordered Father to pay temporary child support of 
$1,166 per month from January 2020, Father was given a credit for the higher amount for January, February, and March, 2020.
4 
Father received a credit of ($1,166 x 3 months) $3,498. The 
family court calculated the amount Father owed from July 2019 
through March 2020 as ($9,720 - $3,498) $6,222. Father was 
ordered to pay the arrearage at $100 per month beginning on 
April 1, 2020, until paid in full. 
On April 7, 2020, Father moved for reconsideration. 
On May 27, 2020, the family court entered an Amended Order on 
Father's Motion for Relief. As to child support, the family court noted Father had physical custody of Children during April, May, and June 2019. Mother owed Father child support of ($682 x 3 months) $2,046, which was credited against Father's arrearage. 
Father was ordered to pay the reduced arrearage of ($6,222 -
$2,046) $4,176 at $100 per month beginning on April 1, 2020, 
until paid in full.
5 
Mother filed the first motion for relief at issue in 
this appeal on September 24, 2020 (Mother's Motion for Relief). 
She claimed that Father did not pay child support for March 2020 ($1,166); that Father improperly deducted $981 from his July 2020 
3 Although Father's Motion for Relief had been filed in April of
2019, it appears that Father had physical custody of Children during April,
May, and June 2019. This is discussed below, in connection with Father'smotion for reconsideration. 
4 The family court's oral order had not set a date for the March
2020 temporary support payment, and Father did not make the March 2020payment. 
5 The amount of Father's arrearage was based upon Father having paid
the March 2020 orally-ordered temporary child support of $1,166, even thoughFather did not make the March payment. 
3   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
child support payment;6 and that Father had not paid child 
support for September 2020 ($1,080). The motion was set for 
hearing on December 7, 2020. 
On October 2, 2020, Mother filed the other motion at 
issue in this appeal, an ex parte motion to advance the December 7, 2020 hearing date on her motion for relief.
7 
Mother's ex parte motion also asked that Father be sanctioned for violating the May 27, 2020 Amended Order and ordered "to pay all of Mother's attorney's fees and costs incurred in relation to this and her earlier motion filed on September 24, 2020." 
The family court advanced the hearing date as Mother 
requested. The hearing began on October 7, 2020, and continued on October 12, 2020. 
On November 17, 2020, the family court entered its 
"Order re [Mother]'s Motions Filed on 9/24/2020 and 10/2/2020." 
As to child support, the November 17, 2020 Order provided: 
1. As of October 2020 , Father owes a total of
$10,129  in unpaid child support to Mother, which includes
the arrearage amount previously determined in the Order
filed May 27, 2020. Father may pay $5,000 of this $10,129amount over time at a minium of $100 per month, due on thefirst of the month with his $1,080.00 child support payment.The remaining amount, $5,129, shall be paid forthwith, andjudgment in this amount shall issue. 
(emphasis added) (footnote omitted). The family court also 
ordered that Father pay Mother's reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred in connection with her motion for relief. 
On November 20, 2020, Mother's counsel filed a 
declaration concerning attorney's fees and costs. On November 23, 2020, the family court entered the Order and 
6 The family court had noted, during the January 23, 2020 hearing on
Father's Motion for Relief, that "the law does not allow the court to say that
whatever [Father] paid for his airline ticket to go to Arizona to visit thechildren takes the place of child support." 
7 The family court's January 14, 2021 Reconsideration Order
incorrectly refers to Mother's ex parte motion as having been filed onOctober 3, 2020. 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Judgment in favor of Mother and against Father for $5,842.93 in 
attorney's fees and costs. 
Father filed a motion for reconsideration on 
November 27, 2020. Mother stipulated that the amount of Father's child support arrearage should have been $7,883 rather than the $10,129 stated in paragraph 1 of the November 17, 2020 Order. 
On January 14, 2021, the family court entered the 
Reconsideration Order from which Father now appeals. The family court granted Father's motion for reconsideration in part and denied it in part. The January 14, 2021 Reconsideration Order provided: 
1. Pursuant to [Mother's] stipulation that
paragraph 1 of the Order Re [Mother]'s Motions Filed on
9/24/2020 and 10/2/2020, filed on November 17, 2020(Nov. 17, 2020 Order), should be corrected, the Motion isgranted insofar as the Nov. 17, 2020 Order is corrected tostate that Father owes a total of $7,982  [sic] in unpaid
child support to Mother as of October 2020 , and not the
$10,129 as stated in the Nov. 17, 2020 Order. 
2. In all other respects, the Motion is denied. 
(emphasis added) (footnote omitted). 
Father filed a timely notice of appeal. Mother did not 
file a cross-appeal. The family court entered its "Findings of 
Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order" (FOF, COL & Order) on 
March 24, 2021. 
Points of Error 
Father's amended opening brief raises four points of 
error:8 
8 Father's amended opening brief does not comply with Rule 28(b)(4)
of the Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure ( HRAP ), which requires that a
point of error cite "where in the record the alleged error occurred[.]"
Father also failed to comply with HRAP Rule 28(b)(4)(C), which requires: "whenthe point involves a finding or conclusion of the court or agency, either aquotation of the finding or conclusion urged as error or reference to appendedfindings and conclusions[.]" A copy of the family court's March 24, 2021 FOF,COL & Order was appended to Father's amended opening brief, but neither thestatement of points nor the appendix specify the particular findings orconclusion challenged by Father.

Standards of Review 
The Hawai# i Supreme Court has held: 
[T]he family court possesses wide discretion in making its
decisions and those decision[s] will not be set aside unlessthere is a manifest abuse of discretion. Thus, we will notdisturb the family court's decisions on appeal unless thefamily court disregarded rules or principles of law orpractice to the substantial detriment of a party litigantand its decision clearly exceeded the bounds of reason.

We review findings of fact under the "clearly 
erroneous" standard. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when 
the record lacks substantial evidence to support the finding or when, despite some evidence to support the finding, we are left with the definite and firm conviction in reviewing all of the evidence that a mistake has been committed. Birano v. State, 143

Discussion 
1. The family court's determination that Father
Owes Mother $7,982.00 in Unpaid Child Supportappears to be a clerical mistake. 
Mother stipulated that the amount of Father's child 
support arrearage should have been $7,883 rather than the $10,129 
stated in paragraph 1 of the November 17, 2020 Order. 
The family 
court's January 14, 2021 Reconsideration Order (which was based on Mother's stipulation) stated that the amount owed by Father was $7,982. We vacate paragraph 1 of the January 14, 2021 Reconsideration Order and remand to the family court for correction of the apparent clerical mistake. 
7  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Father's remaining arguments are without merit. Father 
contends that the family court failed to account for payments 
Father made to the Child Support Enforcement Agency (CSEA). 
Father alleges that in August 2020 "documents [were] served on 
him" from CSEA that purportedly ordered him to pay a total of $154 per month in child support commencing "6/1/2020." The record on appeal contains no copy of a CSEA order.  During the 
hearing on Mother's Motion for Relief, Father's counsel 
9
acknowledged that Father had received a proposed administrative 
order and that "it [was] not yet an order
."10 (Emphasis added.) 
Mother's reply memorandum in support of her motion for relief contained a copy of a CSEA "Notice of Suspended Action," dated September 15, 2020, stating that "all further actions on this case are being suspended, because service of the required documents could not be completed on" Father. Any voluntary 
9 One page of an undated, unsigned document was attached as Exhibit
C to Father's memorandum in opposition to Mother's Motion for Relief. 
10 According to CSEA's website: 
The administrative process begins with a proposed
administrative order being sent to the parties by certified
mail. If the parties are not served by certified mail, anattempt is made to personally serve the proposedadministrative order on the parties. If both parties cannotbe served, the administrative process stops and furtheraction cannot be taken until information on where the partycan be served is obtained by the CSEA. When a party isserved, [they have] the right to request an administrativehearing if the party disagrees with the proposedadministrative order. The request for an administrativehearing must be made within ten (10) days of being servedwith the proposed administrative order. When a request foran administrative hearing is received, a hearing isscheduled only when both parties have been served. If both parties have been served and no one has requested a hearing,the proposed administrative order is processed as anuncontested action. 
A child support order is issued by an administrative
hearings officer after a hearing or as a result of anuncontested action is filed with the Family Court . The child 
support order issued in this manner has the same force andauthority as the child support orders issued by the FamilyCourt.

Enforcement Agency, https://ag.hawaii.gov/csea/order-processing/#OE (lastvisited Mar. 22, 2022). 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
payments by Father to CSEA — or refunds therefor — are an issue 
between Father and CSEA; CSEA is not a party to this appeal. 
Father also contends that the family court should have 
given him additional time to obtain an accounting from CSEA or to call CSEA as a witness to an evidentiary hearing. The record does not indicate Father requested continuances for either of those purposes. Father's argument is waived. See Ass'n of Apt. 
Owners of Wailea Elua v. Wailea Resort Co., 100 Hawai# i 97, 107, 
58 P.3d 608, 618 (2002) ("Legal issues not raised in the trial court are ordinarily deemed waived on appeal."). 
Finally, Father contends that the family court's child 
support calculation is incorrect because it "includes an award of attorney's fees to Mother's counsel which have since been paid (and are not child support arrears)[.]" Father does not cite to any evidence in the record supporting his contention, and we find none. 
2. The family court did not abuse its discretion
by modifying Children's Thanksgiving andsummer visits, but abused its discretion bymodifying spring break visits. 
Father contends that the family court abused its 
discretion by ordering: (a) Children will no longer spend 
Thanksgiving in Hawai# i; (b) Children must be returned to Arizona 
10 days before school starts (rather than 7) after spending their summer break in 
Hawai# i; and (c) Mother will have AJ during 
spring break in odd-numbered years. 
When modifying child custody, "the question is whether 
or not there has been such a change of circumstances that the modification will be for the best interest of the child." Waldecker v. O'Scanlon, 137 Hawai# i 460, 470, 375 P.3d 239, 249 
(2016) (cleaned up). 
A. Thanksgiving 
Father does not challenge the following findings of 
fact, made on March 24, 2020, when the family court ruled on 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Father's Motion for Relief: 
5. [Mother] moved to Montana with both children in 2015
and lived there until 2018. In 2018 she moved to Phoenix, Arizona, where she continues to live to date. 
. . . . 
103. The children have been subjected to a years[-]long tugof war between the parents spanning from Arizona toHawaii. 
The children need peace, stability, and
predictability to return to their lives. It is in the best interest of the children that they remain livingwith Mother in Arizona during the school year, so thattheir established lives, routines and relationships inArizona can continue. However, it is also in thechildren's best interest that they spend the majorityof their non-school time with Father, while alsohaving time with him in Arizona during the school 
year , if he wishes to visit. 
(emphasis added). The May 27, 2020 Amended Order on Father's 
Motion for Relief provided: 
5. Father's Custodial Time with the Children. 
Father shall be awarded custodial time with the children as 
follows: 
. . . . 
d. Thanksgiving Holiday
. Thanksgiving in all
even numbered years commencing after school onthe last day of school before Thanksgiving untilSunday at 6:00 p.m. If Father spends theholiday with the children in Hawaii andaccompanies the children back to Arizona and/orstays in Arizona, he shall instead return thechildren to school on Monday morning. Otherwise they shall be back in Mother's custody inArizona by 6:00 p.m. on Sunday. 
The family court addressed changes in Thanksgiving 
vacation during the October 12, 2020 hearing on Mother's Motion 
for Relief: 
Now, with respect to the Thanksgiving visits. While 
the Court is sympathetic to the fact that Thanksgiving
visits should be as family orientated as possible for thebest interest of the children, the Court also notes that the 
young age of these children  sort of necessitate  a closer 
type of gathering and perhaps less travel for a five-day
period of visitation , and would order that those visits
occur where the children are during the Thanksgiving season. 
In other words, no bringing them to Hawaii, when two
days are spent on the plane. 
10 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(emphasis added). 
The November 17, 2020 Order on Mother's Motion for 
Relief stated: 
4. The following modifications to the current
visitation Order filed May 27, 2020 are hereby granted: 
a. Father's Thanksgiving visits with the children
shall only occur where the children reside, and Father
shall not take them to Hawaii for the Thanksgivingvisit. 
In the March 24, 2021 FOF, COL & Order, the family 
court made a mixed finding of fact and conclusion of law when it 
ruled on Mother's Motion for Relief: 
14. . . . . After hearing all the arguments from both
parties, the Court found that it was in the bestinterest of the children [that] . . . Thanksgivingvisits that are five days long should be spent inArizona where the children reside, given their youngage[.] 
Father's amended opening brief refers to this mixed finding and 
conclusion, but does not specifically contend it was clearly erroneous. It was not. In even-numbered years, Father may have Children after school the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, and must return Children to school on Monday morning. To travel to Hawai# i, Father and Children would be required to fly from 
Arizona to 
Hawai# i on Thanksgiving day, spend Friday and Saturday 
in Hawai# i, and return to Arizona on Sunday to be back at school 
on Monday morning. On this record, we cannot say that the family court abused its discretion by requiring that Father spend Thanksgiving (in even-numbered years) with Children in Arizona, rather than Hawai# i, given Children's young age and the time and 
stress involved to travel between Arizona and Hawai# i. 
B. Summer Break 
The May 27, 2020 Amended Order on Father's Motion for 
Relief provided: 
5. Father's Custodial Time with the Children. 
Father shall be awarded custodial time with the children as 
follows: 
11 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
. . . . 
b. Summer Vacation. 
Every Summer Break . . .
Father's visitation shall commence one week 
after the last day of school at 6:00 p.m.(i.e.[,] if last day of school is a Friday, thenFather's time starts one week later on Friday)and ending at 6:00 p.m. one week before the day
school resumes  (i.e.[,] if school resumes on a
Monday, the children shall be back in Mother'scare on the Monday before school resumes). 
(emphasis added). 
The family court addressed changes in the summer 
vacation schedule during the October 12, 2020 hearing on Mother's 
Motion for Relief: 
With respect to mother's request to order the children
to return from summer vacation no later than two weeks 
before school commences, the Court is inclined to impose a
10 day  buffer for the children, given their age. 
That would provide them with a sufficient period to
adjust to change of time, change of routines, as well as a
change in -- afford them the opportunity to get ready forschool before it starts. 
(emphasis added). 
On March 24, 2021, the family court entered this 
finding: 
14. At the October 12, 2020 hearing, the Court heardarguments from both counsel . . . . After hearing allthe arguments from both parties, the Court . . .(6) found that children require stability and that a10 day buffer for the children to adjust before schoolto be appropriate[.] 
The family court also found: 
37. . . . . 
. . . . 
(b) Educational needs of the children:  The 
children's educational needs are beingadequately met by Mother in Arizonaalthough the Court concludes that Fatherfails to recognize that he must return thechildren to Mother to afford the children adequate time to adjust, affording themthe opportunity [sic] prepare for schoolproperly without haste. 
12 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Father claims, in a footnote in the argument section of his 
amended opening brief, that finding 37(b) was clearly erroneous. Father has not cited any evidence in the record to support his claim of error. On this record, we cannot say that the family court abused its discretion by requiring that Children be returned to Arizona ten days before the beginning of a new school year, in light of Children's young age. 
C. Spring Break 
There is no specific mention of visitation during 
Spring Break in the March 17, 2016 Stipulation, the July 1, 2019 order on Father's Motion for Relief, or the September 9, 2019 second order on Father's Motion for Relief. The May 27, 2020 Amended Order on Father's Motion for Relief provided: 
5. Father's Custodial Time with the Children. 
Father shall be awarded custodial time with the children as 
follows: 
a. Spring Break. Every  Spring Break
commencing after school on the last day ofschool every year for a period of up to ten (10)consecutive days commencing after school on theday the children are released from school andending on the day school resumes when Fathershall drop of [sic] the children off to beginschool that morning at the appropriate time. 
. . . . 
g. A.J.'s Birthday
. If A.J.'s birthday does
not fall during Spring Break , in all even
numbered years, Father may travel to Arizona tospend up to one week with the children in March,to include A.J.'s birthday[.]
(emphasis added). 
During the October 12, 2020 hearing on Mother's Motion 
for Relief the family court stated: 
Second at issue, which I think is actually the crux of
what -- why we keep coming back to court is this disconnect,also set forward in the May 27th order, which is thebirthday of AJ and where it falls within spring break oroutside of spring break. 
The Court believes that it was not the intention to 
deprive mother of all birthdays of AJ , should they fall
within the spring break, but instead –- [interruption byFather's counsel]. 
13 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
So with respect to the two paragraphs that appear on their
face to be a bit problematic, I suppose, for theseparticular parties, the Court believes that mother should 
have at least half of AJ's birthdays, regardless of wherethey fall , and I think that's probably the easiest way of
stating it. 
Thus, in odd numbered [sic] years, mother would spend
those with AJ. 
(emphasis added). 
The November 17, 2020 Order on Mother's Motion for 
Relief stated: 
4. The following modifications to the current
visitation Order filed May 27, 2020 are hereby granted: 
. . . . 
c. Father may not visit the children during A.J.'s
birthday on any odd-numbered year Spring Break visitsso that Mother may celebrate A.J.'s birthday with himduring odd-numbered years . 
(emphasis added). The family court found: 
14. At the October 12, 2020 hearing, the Court heardarguments from both counsel . . . . After hearing allthe arguments from both parties, the Court found thatit was in the best interest of the children to: . . . (2) afford Mother to spend a birthday with one childin "odd numbered" [sic] years[.] 
Father argues that the family court abused its 
discretion based on the doctrine of "law of the case." Father 
cites the supreme court's syllabus in Wong v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 66 Haw. 389, 390, 665 P.2d 157, 159 (1983) ("A judge should generally be hesitant to modify, vacate, or overrule a prior interlocutory order of another judge of equal and concurrent jurisdiction."). Wong was a tort action in which one 
circuit court judge modified a discovery sanction previously entered by another circuit court judge in the same case. The supreme court held: 
A judge should generally be hesitant to modify, vacate or
overrule a prior interlocutory  order of another judge who
sits in the same court. . . . The normal hesitancy that acourt would have in modifying its own prior rulings is evengreater when a judge is asked to vacate the order of abrother or sister judge. 
14 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Id. at 395-96, 665 P.2d at 162 (emphasis added). 
In this case, the family court's May 27, 2020 Amended 
Order on Father's Motion for Relief was not an interlocutory 
order. Mother could have, but did not, appeal from the May 27, 2020 Amended Order. Rather, Mother moved the family court for relief from that order. An order concerning custody of a minor child is "subject to modification or change whenever the best interests of the child require or justify the modification or change[.]" Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 571–46(a)(6) (2018); 
Waldecker, 137 Hawai# i at 470, 375 P.3d at 249 ("[A]ny custody 
award shall be subject to modification or change whenever the 
best interests of the child require or justify the modification or change."). The "law of the case" doctrine does not apply under the circumstances of this case. 
We nevertheless conclude that the family court abused 
its discretion by modifying the Spring Break provision of the May 27, 2020 Amended Order. Although the family court recited the "best interest of the children" standard, its ruling was based upon what it felt was Mother's best interest. Mother cites nothing in the record indicating that it was in AJ's "best interest" to modify the Spring Break provision in the May 27, 2020 Amended Order. Accordingly, we vacate that part of the January 14, 2021 Reconsideration Order denying reconsideration of the Spring Break provisions of the November 17, 2020 Order on Mother's Motion for Relief. 
3. The family court did not deprive Father of
due process. 
Father contends, for the first time on appeal, that the 
family court deprived him of custodial rights without an 
evidentiary hearing. Mother's Motion for Relief was filed on September 24, 2020, and set for hearing on December 7, 2020. On October 2, 2020, Mother filed an ex parte motion to advance the December 7, 2020 hearing date. The family court advanced the hearing date to October 7, 2020.

During the hearing Father's counsel explained that she 
had prepared a response, and requested leave to email it to the 
court. The family court granted the request. Father's counsel explained that Father had not signed his declaration. The family court asked counsel to "send what you have." Father's counsel began to make an offer of proof. The following exchange took place: 
[THE COURT:] So I am not going to be ambushed by a
late filing. I am sympathetic to you, [Father's counsel],
but I don't have much time. 
. . . . 
So what the Court will do to afford an opportunity to
review, and also, [Father's counsel], perhaps you can get[Father]'s declaration signed. 
Otherwise, I'm going to
afford it no weight. 
[FATHER'S COUNSEL]: Okay. 
THE COURT: We will move this to Monday [October 12,
2020] at 3:00. 
You have 15 minutes, and I will assume that everything
is in your pleadings, and I'm just going to -- we will do
limited argument, and then I will just issue the order.Okay? 
[FATHER'S COUNSEL]: Yes. Thank you very much, your
Honor. 
Father accepted the family court's five-day continuance to allow 
Father time to sign his declaration and file his response to Mother's Motion for Relief. Father also agreed to a limited argument. Father never requested an evidentiary hearing. Father's argument that the family court deprived him of due process is without merit. 
4. The record is not sufficient for us to 
determine whether the family court erred byawarding attorney's fees and costs to Mother. 
The November 17, 2020 Order stated "Father shall pay 
Mother's reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred in 
relation to her Motions." The November 23, 2020 Order and Judgment awarded attorney's fees of $5,842.93. Neither order identifies the authority under which the award was made.

The March 24, 2021 FOF, COL & Order cites HRS §§ 580-9 
and 584-16, but neither applies to this case. The former refers 
to temporary spousal support in annulment, divorce, and separation cases, but Father and Mother were never married and Mother never claimed spousal support from Father. The latter is part of the Hawai# i Uniform Parentage Act, but the parties never 
contested Father's paternity of Children. 
The family court made the following conclusion of law 
(which is actually a combined finding of fact and conclusion of law): 
49. The Court finds that Father's actions, including his
failure to return the children to Mother as set forth in the March 24, 2020 Order on July 29, 2020[,] wasnot an isolated incident. This Court concludes that Father's consistent failure to adhere to the Court's Orders support the finding that Father's payment ofMother's attorney's fees and costs to be fair andreasonable. 
It thus appears that the family court assessed Mother's 
attorney's fees against Father as a sanction. 
It is well established . . . that orders imposing sanctions
should set forth findings that describe, with reasonablespecificity, the perceived misconduct (such as harassment orbad faith conduct), as well as the appropriate sanctioningauthority. 
Trs. of Est. of Bishop v. Au, 146 Hawai# i 272, 282, 463 P.3d 929, 
939 (2020) (cleaned up). 
The supreme court explained that the making of findings 
regarding the purported misconduct "serves multiple important 
purposes": 
First, it clearly identifies and explains to the sanctioned
person the conduct underlying the sanction. Additionally,findings that describe with reasonable particularity theperceived misconduct facilitate a meaningful and moreefficient appellate review. Specifying the sanctioningauthority, including the court's inherent authority ifapplicable, is also necessary for meaningful appellatereview. Finally, the findings assure both the litigants andthe court that the decision to impose sanctions was theresult of reasoned consideration.

(citations omitted). 
Here, the November 17, 2020 Order, November 23, 2020 
Order and Judgment, and March 24, 2021 FOF, COL & Order were 
deficient because they failed to specify the authority supporting an award of attorney's fees to Mother. If the fee award was intended to be a sanction, they failed to set forth findings that describe, with reasonable specificity, the perceived misconduct by Father, as well as the appropriate sanctioning authority. Accordingly, we vacate the November 23, 2020 Order and Judgment and the portions of the November 17, 2020 Order and the March 24, 2021 FOF, COL & Order pertaining to the award of Mother's attorney's fees and costs. 
We remand to the family court for: 
(1) specification of the authority supporting the award of attorney's fees and costs to Mother; and (2) if the award of attorney's fees and costs imposes a sanction against Father, findings that describe, with reasonable specificity, the perceived misconduct by Father, as well as the appropriate sanctioning authority. 
Conclusion 
For the foregoing reasons, the family court's 
November 23, 2020 Order and Judgment is vacated, the January 14, 
2021 Reconsideration Order is vacated in part, the March 24, 2021 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order is vacated in part, and this case is remanded to the family court for further proceedings consistent with this memorandum opinion.
