RQ, Respondent-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(FC-DA NO. 20-1-002043) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and McCullen, JJ.) 
Self-represented Respondent-Appellant RQ (Father
) 
appeals from the Family Court of the First Circuit's1 (Family 
Court) October 12, 2020 Order for Protection (Protective Order), 
and January 15, 2021 Order Denying Respondent's Motion for 
Reconsideration. 
On appeal, Father asserts that the Family Court erred 
in granting the Protective Order to Petitioner-Appellee KQ (Mother) on behalf of the parties' minor child (Child) and 
denying his Motion for Reconsideration, pursuant to Hawai# i Rules 
of Civil Procedure (HRCP) 
 Rule 59(e).  To that end, Father raises 
the following seven points of error:2

expected to comply with, all of the provisions of these rules." 
Father's 
third amended opening brief, however, does not comply with HRAP Rule 28(b),and his arguments are addressed "to the extent they can reasonably bediscerned" to promote equal access to justice for pro se litigants. Wagner v.
World Botanical Gardens, Inc., 126 Hawai #i 190, 193, 268 P.3d 443, 446
(App. 2011). 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve Father's points as follows: 
1. Father Fails To Meet His Burden Of Showing That The Family
Court Erred By Not Appointing Counsel Sua Sponte 
Father argues that the "Family Court erred by not 
appointing counsel on behalf of Respondent who is an indigent 
defendant in a custody hearing where the Plaintiff's allegations was prosecuted by her counsel[,]" and cites to State v. Loher, 140 Hawai# i 205, 398 P.3d 794 (2017). 
In Loher, the Hawaii Supreme Court held that the trial 
court deprived the defendant of his "constitutional right to the assistance of counsel as provided by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 14 of the Hawai#i Constitution." Id. at 220, 398 P.3d at 809. See also 
State v. Uchima, 147 Hawai# i 64, 74, 464 P.3d 852, 862 (2020) 
(explaining that an indigent defendant charged with an offense punishable by imprisonment has a state and federal constitutional right to have the assistance of counsel at every critical stage of the prosecution). 
Father, however, had not been charged with 
any offense punishable by imprisonment. 
Instead, the Family Court issued a Protective Order 
pursuant to HRS § 586-5.5(a) (2018), which makes no mention of appointing counsel. Of note, HRS § 586-5(b) (2018) provides in 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
part that "[a]ll parties shall be present at the hearing and may 
be represented by counsel." HRS § 586-5(b). Thus, the plain language of HRS § 586-5 does not require the Family Court to appoint counsel for Father. 
In matters involving the termination of parental rights 
or petitions for family supervision or foster custody by the Department of Human Services (DHS), however, indigent parents 
have a guaranteed right to court-appointed counsel under the due 
process clause in article I, section 5 of the Hawai# i 
Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. 
A parent's constitutionally protected liberty 
interest is at stake when parental rights are substantially affected, hence the right to court-appointed counsel. See In re 
T.M., 131 Hawai# i 419, 436, 319 P.3d 338, 355 (2014), holding 
modified by In re L.I., 149 Hawai# i 118, 122-23, 482 P.3d 1079, 
1083-84 (2021). 
The underlying proceeding in this case involves a 
domestic abuse protective order, not a termination of parental rights or petitions for family supervision or foster custody. Moreover, Father retained visitation, albeit supervised, during the Protective Order, and the record does not reflect that Father requested a court-appointed counsel. Father, thus, fails to meet his burden of showing that the Family Court erred by not appointing counsel 
sua sponte. See In re RGB, 123 Hawai# i 1, 18, 
229 P.3d 1066, 1083 (2010). 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2. The Family Court Heard Father's Notice and Motion And Motion
to Dismiss 
Father argues that the Family Court erred by dismissing 
his "Notice & Motion for [HRCP] Rule 60(b)(3) Hearing/ 
Counterclaim for Contempt of Court & Tortious Interference with Custody/Visitation" (Notice and Motion) and "Motion to Dismiss 
Complaint" (Motion to Dismiss) without a hearing. 
This argument is without merit because the court did, 
in fact, conduct a hearing on his motions. On October 7, 2020, 
Mother's Petition for an Order for Protection on Behalf of Family or Household Member(s) (Petition) and Father's Notice and Motion 
and Motion to Dismiss came on for hearing before the Family 
Court. Per the October 7, 2020 Family Court minutes, all parties appeared in-person and testimony occurred from 11:21-11:32 a.m. and 11:41-11:48 a.m. After testimony, the Family Court denied without prejudice Father's Notice and Motion and Motion to Dismiss, and granted Father's request for a continuance to October 12, 2020 so that Father could prepare his exhibits for trial on Mother's Petition. 
3. Father Fails To Show His Exercise Of Religion Was
Substantially Burdened 
Father argues that the "failure of the Family Court to 
recognize and uphold religious freedom imposes unlawful rule of 
fundamental human rights . . . ." 
To find unconstitutional infringement of Father's 
religious practices, we must examine if the activity "was motivated by and rooted in a legitimate and sincerely held religious belief," if the "free exercise of religion had been burdened," "the extent or impact of the regulation on the 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
parties' religious practices," and if there was a compelling 
interest to justify the burden. State v. Adler, 108 Hawai# i 169, 
177, 118 P.3d 652, 660 (2005) (citation omitted). 
Notably, "the 
United States Supreme Court has long recognized a distinction between the freedom of individual belief, which is absolute, and the freedom of individual conduct, which is not absolute." Id. 
(internal quotation marks omitted).
 Regarding Father's September 20, 2020 conduct, Mother 
alleged Father called the police and filed a false report, yelled at Child, hit Child with a back scratcher on her forearm hard enough to leave a mark, and hit Child in the head. In compliance with HRS § 586-5.5, the Family Court provided Father with an opportunity to show why the protective order should not be continued. 
The Family Court ultimately found Mother credible, 
and that she proved the material allegations in the Petition. This process cannot be said to substantially burden Father's exercise of religion. State v. Armitage, 132 Hawai# i 36, 62, 319 
P.3d 1044, 1070 (2014) (requiring appellant to show a substantial burden on his practice of religion, and holding that requiring an application process to go to 
Kaho#olawe "cannot be said to 
'substantially burden' the exercise of religion"). 
4. The Family Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion By Not
Punishing Mother For Custodial Interference
 Father argues that the Family Court abused its 
discretion by not "punishing" Mother for custodial interference 
during the weekend of September 19, 2020 through September 21, 2020 "in direct violation of [the] 06/10/2020 interim protection order" pursuant to HRS § 587A-37 (2018). 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRS § 587A-37 provides that "[i]f a party fails to 
comply with the terms and conditions of an order issued by the 
court under this chapter, the court may apply the provisions of section 710-1077 and any other provisions available under the law." But, the "06/10/2020 interim protection order" to which Father refers was an order continuing the parties' motions for post-decree relief in the parties' divorce action in FC-D 10-1-2770. This order also provided that Father have certain "parenting time" with Child and that "Mother shall facilitate and encourage the child to spend time with Father." Thus, HRS § 587A-37 was not applicable because Mother did not violate any order issued under HRS chapter 587A. 
Moreover, a person commits the offense of custodial 
interference if: 
The person, in the absence of a court order
determining custody or visitation rights, intentionally or
knowingly takes, detains, conceals, or entices away a minorwith the intent to deprive another person or a public agencyof their right to custody, and removes the minor from theState. 
HRS § 707–726(1)(c) (2014). This appeal, however, involves a 
protective order, not a criminal charge against Mother for custodial interference. 
And while the Protective Order pertained to Father's 
Child, and thus affected his custody, the Protective Order granted Father supervised visitations at Parents and Children Together (PACT) until the order expired.  The Protective Order 
also stated that "[a]ll orders regarding custody and visitation 
are subject to modification in parties' divorce action." 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In the parties' related divorce matter in FC-D 10-1-
2770, Mother was ultimately awarded sole physical and legal 
custody of Child, subject to Father's right to visitation. In sum, the record does not show that Mother deprived Father of custody or removed Child from the State and, thus, the Family Court did not abuse its discretion by not "punishing" Mother for custodial interference. 
5. Father Fails To Meet His Burden Of Showing That The Family
Court Erred By Concluding Mother Proved The MaterialAllegations In The Petition 
Father appears to argue that the Family Court 
improperly relied on "inflammatory and/or libelous testimony, 
false allegations and serious misrepresentation of material facts[,]" rather than his testimony that he exercised "reasonable parental discipline." 
In Hamilton ex rel. Lethem v. Lethem, the Hawai# i 
Supreme Court held: 
(1) parents have a constitutional right to discipline
children inhering in their liberty interest in the care,custody, and control of their children, under the dueprocess clause, article 1, section 5 of the Hawai #i 
Constitution, (2) a parent may raise the right of parentaldiscipline in a [HRS] § 586–5 show cause hearing inopposition to the continuation of a temporary restrainingorder (TRO) issued under HRS chapter 586 on allegations of
domestic abuse, (3) in such circumstances trial courts shallconsider whether the discipline is reasonably related to thepurpose of safeguarding or promoting the welfare of theminor in determining whether the parent's conductconstituted abuse or proper discipline, and (4) generally anon-custodial parent retains the right to discipline a childwhen the child is under his or her supervision. 
126 Hawai# i 294, 296, 270 P.3d 1024, 1026 (2012). 
Here, the Family Court made findings that Father 
testified he "disciplined, not hit" Child. 
After considering 
this testimony, the Family Court nonetheless concluded that 
Mother proved the material allegations in her Petition based on 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
DHS's Report dated October 5, 2020 (Report), stipulated exhibits, 
and the credibility of Mother and DHS Social Worker Canionero (SW Canionero). The Family Court further concluded that Father failed to show good cause why the TRO should not be continued. 
To the extent Father argues that the Family Court 
"relied upon inflammatory and/or libelous testimony, false 
allegations and serious misrepresentation" rather than his parental discipline testimony, we "will not pass upon issues dependent upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence." Kie v. McMahel, 91 Hawai# i 438, 444, 984 P.2d 1264, 
1270 (App. 1999) (citation, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted). 
Moreover, this Court cannot determine whether the 
Family Court considered the reasonableness of Father's actions because Father failed to provide transcripts of the October 7, 2020 and the October 12, 2020 hearings. See HRAP 
Rule 10(b)(1)(A); Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai# i 225, 
230, 909 P.2d 553, 558 (1995) (explaining that the "burden is upon appellant in an appeal to show error by reference to matters in the record, and he or she has the responsibility of providing an adequate transcript") (citation, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted). 
Thus, Father failed to meet his burden of 
showing that the Family Court erred in concluding that Mother proved the allegations in the Petition and Father failed to show good cause why the TRO should not be continued. 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
6. Father Failed To Meet His Burden Of Showing There Was
Insufficient Evidence 
Father appears to challenge the sufficiency of the 
evidence supporting the Family Court's conclusion that he did not 
show good cause why the TRO should not be continued. 
Sufficient evidence exists when "the record contains 
'substantial evidence' supporting the family court's determinations . . . ; the testimony of a single witness, if found by the trier of fact to have been credible, will suffice." In re Doe, 95 Hawai# i 183, 196, 20 P.3d 616, 629 (2001) 
(citations omitted). 
Here, the Family Court held a hearing on the Petition 
and found the testimonies of Mother and SW Canionero credible. With Mother and SW Canionero's testimonies, there was sufficient evidence to support a conclusion that Mother proved the allegations in the Petition and Father did not show good cause why the TRO should not be continued. See Id.; Kie v. McMahel, 91 
Hawai#i at 442, 984 P.2d at 1268 (interpreting HRS § 586-5.5(a) 
to mean, "[w]hile at [the] hearing the respondent must 'show cause why' the protective order is not necessary, [] the burden remains on the petitioner to prove the petitioner's underlying allegations by a preponderance of the evidence.") (citation omitted). 
7. The Protective Order Will Not Be Set Aside Based on 
Conflicting Evidence 
Finally, Father appears to argue that the Family Court 
erred by issuing the Protective Order based, in part, on DHS's 
Report because it conflicted with the Notice of CWS Disposition dated November 25, 2020 (Disposition). 
10 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In the Report, DHS confirmed alleged physical abuse and 
threat of abuse by Father based on Child's "fearfulness of 
[Father's] methods of physical discipline and his aggression towards her causing [Child] to feel unsafe and vulnerable to his anger while in his care." In the Disposition, DHS indicated that the allegation of threatened physical harm or abuse was confirmed, and did not comment on physical harm or abuse. It is not entirely clear, however, that the Report and the Disposition speak to the same incident. 
Assuming, arguendo, that the Report and Disposition 
were about the same incident and were in conflict, judgments "based on conflicting evidence will not be set aside where there is substantial evidence to support the trier of fact's findings." State v. Mattiello, 90 Hawai# i 255, 259, 978 P.2d 693, 697 (1999) 
(citations, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted). Again, the Family Court considered the Report, and the credibility of Mother's and SW Canionero's testimonies. 
As 
discussed above, Mother's and SW Canionero's testimonies provided sufficient evidence to support the Family Court's decision. Contradiction, if any, between the Report and Disposition will not be a basis for setting aside the Family Court's Order. 
CONCLUSION 
In sum, the record on appeal does not indicate that 
Father presented new evidence or arguments that could not have been presented during the underlying proceeding. Thus, the Family Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Father's motion for reconsideration. See
 HRCP 59(e); Ass'n of Apartment
