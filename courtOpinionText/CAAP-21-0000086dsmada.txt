NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
NO. CAAP-21-0000086 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI#I 
NADETH M. GUITY, Petitioner-Appellee, v.
WALTER N. GUITY, Respondent-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(FC-DA NO. 10-1-6266) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Hiraoka and McCullen, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, this court lacks 
jurisdiction over this appeal because the Notice of Appeal, filed 
February 25, 2021, seeks to appeal from an Order Denying Motion And Declaration To Dissolve (
Order), filed by the Family Court of 
the First Circuit on October 5, 2020, but the Notice of Appeal was filed more than thirty days after the Order. The Notice of Appeal is therefore untimely. See
 Hawai#i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 4(a)(1); 
Grattafiori v. State
, 79 Hawai#i 
10, 13, 897 P.2d 937, 940 (1995) ("As a general rule, compliance with the requirement of the timely filing of a notice of appeal is jurisdictional, . . . and we must dismiss an appeal on our motion if we lack jurisdiction.") (citations and internal quotation marks omitted); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
or justice is authorized to change the jurisdictional 
requirements contained in Rule 4 of these rules."). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 
DATED: 
Honolulu, Hawai# i, January 26, 2022.
