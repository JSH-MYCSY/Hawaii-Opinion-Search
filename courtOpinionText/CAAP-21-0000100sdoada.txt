(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Hiraoka and McCullen, JJ.) 
Self-represented Claimant-Appellant-Appellant 
Jeremy A.K. 
Konohia appeals from the Decision and Order (D&O) 
entered by the Hawai# i Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals 
Board (LIRAB) on February 10, 2021.  For the reasons explained 
below, we affirm the LIRAB D&O. 
On June 9, 2016, Konohia was injured while working for 
Employer-Appellee-Appellee Commodity Forwarders, Inc. (together 
with Insurance Carrier-Appellee-Appellee Liberty Mutual Insurance, 
Employer).  Konohia reported his injury to Employer, 
and a claim for workers compensation benefits was initiated.  Konohia received treatment for his injury and payment of temporary total disability (TTD) benefits. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Hawai# i Department of Labor and Industrial 
Relations (DLIR
) Disability Compensation Division (DCD) conducted 
a hearing on August 26, 2020.  On September 3, 2020, the DCD 
issued a written decision, signed on behalf of the director of labor (the Director's Decision).  The Director's Decision stated: 
APPEAL: This decision may be appealed by filing a written
notice of appeal with the Director of Labor and IndustrialRelations or the Director's county representative withintwenty days after a copy of this decision has been sent. 
DLIR mailed the Director's Decision to Konohia on September 3, 
2020. 
By handwritten letter dated September 20, 2020, Konohia 
appealed the Director's Decision.1  The envelope that contained 
Konohia's appeal was postmarked September 21, 2020.  The envelope and letter both bear date stamps of September 24, 2020. 
By letter dated September 25, 2020, DLIR informed 
Konohia that it had received his appeal letter on September 24, 2020. 
On November 24, 2020, LIRAB issued an order to show 
cause why Konohia's appeal should not be dismissed as untimely. Konohia and Employer were directed to respond.  A hearing was set for December 22, 2020.  An amended order to show cause was issued, resetting the hearing for January 7, 2021. 
The record on appeal does not contain a written 
response by Konohia to either of the orders to show cause, or a transcript of the LIRAB hearing.  LIRAB issued the D&O on February 10, 2021.  LIRAB found that Konohia's appeal was due on September 23, 2020, but was filed with DLIR's Maui district office on September 24, 2020.  LIRAB concluded that the appeal was untimely under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 386-87(a), and 
that the statutory deadline was mandatory, citing Kissell v. Lab. 
1 We take judicial notice, pursuant to Rule 201 of the Hawai #i Rules 
of Evidence, that September 20, 2020 was a Sunday.

& Indus. Rels. Appeals Bd., 57 Haw. 37, 549 P.2d 470 (1976). 
LIRAB dismissed Konohia's appeal.  This appeal followed.2 
It is well-established that appellate courts review LIRAB's
findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard. However, LIRAB's conclusions of law cannot bind an appellatecourt and are freely reviewable for their correctness. Thus, the court reviews conclusions of law de novo, underthe right/wrong standard. 
Skahan v. Stutts Constr. Co., 148 Hawai# i 460, 466, 478 P.3d 285, 
291 (2021) (cleaned up). 
LIRAB found that "[t]he Director's [D]ecision was dated 
and sent to the parties on September 3, 2020."  That finding was 
supported by substantial evidence and was not clearly erroneous. 
LIRAB concluded that "[t]he due date for filing a 
timely appeal in this case was September 23, 2020."  That conclusion was right under HRS § 386-87.

LIRAB found that Konohia's appeal was "filed with 
[DLIR's] Maui District Office on September 24, 2020[.]"  That finding was supported by substantial evidence and was not clearly erroneous. 
LIRAB concluded that "the time for filing a written 
notice of appeal is mandatory."  That conclusion was right. Kissell, 57 Haw. 37, 549 P.2d 470; see also Nickells v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 98 Hawai# i 508, 51 P.3d 375 (App. 2002). 
2 Konohia's opening brief does not comply with Rule 28 of the 
Hawai #i  Rules of Appellate Procedure.  Nevertheless, the Hawai #i Supreme Court
instructs that to promote access to justice, pleadings prepared by self-
represented litigants should be interpreted liberally, and self-representedlitigants should not automatically be foreclosed from appellate review becausethey fail to comply with court rules.  Erum v. Llego, 147 Hawai #i 368, 380-81, 
465 P.3d 815, 827-28 (2020). 
3 HRS § 386-87 (2015) provides, in relevant part: 
Appeals to appellate board .  (a) A decision of the director
shall be final and conclusive between the parties, except as
provided in section 386-89 ["Reopening of cases"], unlesswithin twenty days  after a copy has been sent to each party,
either party appeals therefrom to the appellate board byfiling  a written notice of appeal with the appellate board
or the department. 
(bold italics added). 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
LIRAB found and concluded that the Director's Decision 
"was sent to the parties on September 3, 2020 and Claimant's 
appeal was filed on September 24, 2020.  Claimant's appeal was filed 1 day late.  Accordingly, the mandatory nature of §386-87(a), HRS, requires dismissal of this appeal."  This combined finding and conclusion was supported by LIRAB's findings of fact and reflected an application of the correct rule of law. See Hawai# i Administrative Rules § 12-47-12 ("The file stamped 
date on the document shall be regarded as the date of filing."). Accordingly, it will not be overturned.  Est. of Klink ex rel. Klink v. State, 113 Hawai# i 332, 351, 152 P.3d 504, 523 (2007). 
For the foregoing reasons, the Decision and Order 
entered by the Hawai# i Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals 
Board on February 10, 2021, is affirmed.
