JOHNATHEN SWAIM, also known as Jonathen Swaim and
Jonathan Swaim, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI I #, Respondent-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1PR171000013; 1PC101001235) 
MEMORANDUM OPINION 
(By: Ginoza, C.J., and Wadsworth and Nakasone, JJ.) 
Petitioner-Appellant Johnathen Swaim, also known as 
Jonathen Swaim and Jonathan Swaim (
Swaim), appeals from the 
February 21, 2021 "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and 
Order Denying Petition to Vacate, Set Aside or Correct Judgment Pursuant to Rule 40 of the 
Hawai# i Rules of Penal Procedure, 
[(HRPP)] Filed July 12, 2017" (Order Denying Rule 40 Petition), 
entered in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit 
Court).1/  For the reasons explained below, we affirm the Order 
Denying Rule 40 Petition. 
I. Background 
On October 7, 2010, after pleading no contest, Swaim 
was adjudged guilty of Burglary in the First Degree (Burglary One), in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 
ยง 708-810(1)(c) (1993).  As further explained below, Swaim was 
sentenced on January 18, 2011, to five years probation, with one 
1/ The Honorable Matthew J. Viola presided.   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
year incarceration as a special condition, subject to early 
release to participate in substance abuse treatment.  Pursuant to an Order of Resentencing; Revocation of Probation, entered on February 7, 2013, Swaim's probation was revoked and he was resentenced to, inter alia, a ten-year term of incarceration on the Burglary One conviction. 
On July 12, 2017, Swaim filed a "Petition to Vacate, 
Set Aside, or Correct Judgment Pursuant to Rule 40 of the [HRPP]" (Petition), initiating case no. 1PR171000013.  On June 27, 2018, 
the Circuit Court entered an order denying the Petition without a 
hearing (June 27, 2018 Order).
2/  Swaim appealed from the June 27, 
2018 Order, initiating appellate case number CAAP-18-0000589.  
In a summary disposition order (SDO), this court 
affirmed in part and vacated in part the June 27, 2018 Order.  Swaim v. State (Swaim I), No. CAAP-18-0000589, 2020 WL 1698792, at *3 (Haw. App. Apr. 7, 2020).  We vacated that part of the order denying without a hearing Swaim's claim that his counsel was ineffective for advising him to plead no contest, and affirmed the order in all other respects.  Id. at *2-3.  We remanded the case for an evidentiary hearing on Swaim's ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, which we construed to encompass Swaim's contentions that:  (1) "[Swaim] received ineffective assistance of counsel because, had his counsel not encouraged him to change his plea to no contest, the charge would have been dismissed or he would have been found not guilty"; and (2) "[Swaim's] plea was coerced and he was forced to change his plea by counsel[.]"  Id. at *1. 
On remand, the Circuit Court held an evidentiary 
hearing on Swaim's claims on January 15, 2021.  Swaim and his former trial counsel, Deputy Public Defender Edward K. Harada (Harada), testified.  The court found Harada's testimony to be 
credible.  Several exhibits were received into evidence.  
On February 21, 2021, the Circuit Court issued the 
Order Denying Rule 40 Petition.  The following findings of fact 
(FOFs), among others, are unchallenged on appeal and are thus

binding on the parties and this court, see State v. Rodrigues, 
145 Hawai# i 487, 494, 454 P.3d 428, 435 (2019): 
1. On August 1, 2010, . . . Swaim . . . was
arrested for the offense of Burglary in the First Degree. 
2. On August 3, 2010, [Respondent-Appellee] State 
of Hawai #i [( State )] filed a Felony Information against
[Swaim] for the class B felony offense of Burglary in the
First Degree under Case No. 1PC101001235. 
3. On August 9, 2010, [Swaim] was in custody and
appeared at an arraignment and plea hearing.  He entered a plea of "not guilty" to Burglary in the First Degree charge. 
4. At the time [Swaim] was arrested and charged
with the Burglary in the First Degree offense, he wasalready serving a five year term of felony HOPE probationbased on his conviction for the class C felony offense ofNegligent Injury in the First Degree (Case No.1PC061000407). 
5. Judge Steven Alm was the circuit court judge
assigned to [Swaim's] HOPE probation case.  After [Swaim]was initially sentenced to a five year term of probation in2009, on April 21, 2010, Judge Alm granted a motion to
revoke [Swaim's] probation and resentenced him to another
five year term of probation. 
6. On August 19, 2010, [Swaim] was released from
custody at the O #ahu Community Correctional Center after
posting the requisite bond. 
7. On August 30, 2010, the court appointed The
Office of the Public Defender as defense counsel in Case No. 1PC101001235. Deputy Public Defender . . . Harada . . . wasassigned to the case.  Mr. Harada was a very experiencedcriminal trial attorney.  He had been a trial attorney withthe Office of the Public Defender since 1984 and had handled several thousand criminal cases, including dozens involvingthe charge of Burglary in the First Degree. 
8. The burglary case was assigned to Judge Randal
K.O. Lee for trial.  A pretrial conference was set forSeptember 15, 2010, a trial call was set for September 30,2010, and a trial was set for the week of October 11, 2010. 
9. Between August 30, 2010, and September 30, 2010,
Mr. Harada received, reviewed and evaluated the discovery,including the police reports, made an initial evaluation ofthe case, including possible defenses, and determined thatno pretrial motions needed to be filed.  Based on his review of the discovery, Mr. Harada formed an opinion that the casewas "triable", because [Swaim] had possible defenses,including reasonable doubt as to intent/knowledge and
mistake of fact and the possibility of the lesser included
offense of trespass.  Mr. Harada also apprised himself of[Swaim's] HOPE probation case, in which the Office of thePublic Defender also represented [Swaim]. 
10. Between August 30, 2010, and September 30, 2010,
Mr. Harada sent correspondence to [Swaim's] address andattempted to make contact with [Swaim] to set up an in-person meeting to discuss [Swaim's] pending cases.  A meeting was set for September 16, 2010, but [Swaim] failedto appear for the meeting. 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
11. On September 15, 2010, Mr. Harada appeared
before Judge Lee for a pretrial conference.  The State . . . 
was represented by Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Amy Murakami. At the conclusion of the pretrial conference, Judge Lee toldcounsel that if [Swaim] pled to the burglary charge, he wasinclined to sentence [Swaim] to probation with no furtherimprisonment if [Swaim] obtained substance abusetrea[t]ment. 
12. On September 15, 2010, following the pretrial
conference before Judge Lee, Mr. Harada and Ms. Murakami metwith Judge Alm to discuss [Swaim's] HOPE probation case,because the outcome of the burglary case had the potentialto impact [Swaim's] status on HOPE probation. 
13. At the conference, Judge Alm initially indicated
his strong inclination that he would revoke [Swaim's] HOPEprobation, due to [Swaim's] poor performance on probation,and resentence him to a open five year term of imprisonment- even if [Swaim] were acquitted on the Burglary in theFirst Degree charge. 
14. After Mr. Harada advocated strongly for [Swaim]
to be given another opportunity on probation, Judge Almchanged his initial inclination and told counsel that, if[Swaim] pled to the burglary case, he would revoke [Swaim's]probation, but resentence him to another term of HOPEprobation, as long as [Swaim] entered into a residentialsubstance abuse treatment program.  Based on Mr. Harada's experience with Judge Alm, he believed that Judge Alm wouldfollow this inclination when [Swaim] was resentenced. 
15. On September 30, 2010, Mr. Harada and [Swaim]
appeared before Judge Lee for trial call.  Because this was the first in person meeting Mr. Harada had had with [Swaim]and he believed he was not ready to proceed to trial, Mr.Harada requested a continuance.  [Swaim] objected to Mr.Harada's request for a continuance and to waiving time under[HRPP] Rule 48.  Mr. Harada asked Judge Lee for permission
to withdraw as [Swaim's] counsel.  His request was not
granted, but Judge Lee set a further trial call onOctober 7, 2010. 
16. Prior to October 7, 2010, Mr. Harada met in
person with [Swaim] on at least two occasions.  The meetings each lasted over an hour.  During those meetings, Mr. Haradaand [Swaim] discussed the burglary case in depth and Mr.Harada answered [Swaim's] questions.  Mr. Harada informed [Swaim] of the elements of Burglary in the First Degreeoffense, and provided him with a printout of the Westlawannotation of the Burglary in the First Degree statute.  He reviewed the facts of the case and provided [Swaim] with a
copy of the police reports.  He also explained possible
defenses to the charge, including reasonable doubt as tointent/knowledge and mistake of fact and the possibility ofthe lesser included offense of trespass.  Because [Swaim]had been drinking alcohol on the day of the alleged offense(which was in violation of the terms and conditions of hisprobation in his negligent injury case), Mr. Harada alsodiscussed the impact of the statute precluding admission ofevidence of self-induced intoxication and provided [Swaim]with a printout of the Westlaw annotation of the relevantstatute.  Mr. Harada explained to [Swaim] that although hebelieved the burglary case was "winnable", he neverguaranteed such an outcome to [Swaim]. 
17. Mr. Harada also informed [Swaim] of the 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
sentencing/resentencing inclinations Judges Lee and Alm had
provided at the September 15, 2010 conferences.  He explained to [Swaim] that based on Judge Alm's statements,he risked being resentenced and sent to prison in his HOPEcase, if he went to trial and was acquitted in the burglarlycase, but that if he pled to the burglary charge, Judge Almwas inclined to resentence him to another term of probationon the condition that he complete a residential substanceabuse treatment program.  One of [Swaim's] most pressing
concerns was avoiding a prison term. 
18. Accordingly, Mr. Harada advised [Swaim] that in
his opinion, even though the burglarly case was "winnable",
given the sentencing/resentencing inclinations of probationprovided by Judges Alm and Lee if he changed his plea in theburglary case, the "smart play" would be to plead no contestin the burglary case, as this would likely result in himbeing placed/replaced on probation and avoiding a prisonterm.  Mr. Harada told [Swaim], however, that the choice togo to trial in the burglarly case or to change his plea washis alone to make. 
19. During a meeting on October 6, 2010, [Swaim]
informed Mr. Harada that he had decided to follow Mr. Harada's advice and to change his plea to "no contest" inthe burglary case.  Mr. Harada prepared a change of pleaform, reviewed it with [Swaim], and [Swaim] and Mr. Haradasigned the form. 
20.  On October 7, 2010, [Swaim] and Mr. Harada
appeared before Judge Lee for a further trial call.  At a bench conference, Judge Lee informed counsel that heintended to follow his sentencing inclination that he hadinformed counsel of at the September 15, 2010 pretrialconference.  [Swaim] changed his plea to "no contest." Following a colloquy with [Swaim] regarding his change ofplea, Judge Lee accepted the plea, finding that [Swaim] hadentered his plea and waived his right to a trial knowingly,intelligently and voluntarily.  He adjudged [Swaim] guilty
of the offense of Burglar[]y in the First Degree and set
sentencing for January 18, 2011.  Judge Lee also informed[Swaim] of his inclination to sentence him to probation withno additional jail provided that he entered into treatmentfor alcohol abuse. 
21. In its Summary Disposition Order entered on
April 7, 2020 . . ., the Intermediate Court of Appeals . . .found/concluded that [Swaim's] "claim that he did notknowingly and intelligently enter his no contest plea iswithout merit." 
22. On or about October 15, 2010, a Motion for
Revocation of Probation was filed in Case No. 1PC061000407. This was the second motion for revocation that had been filed in the case.  [Swaim] was taken into custody. 
23. Prior to January 18, 2011, Mr. Harada made
efforts to secure a residential substance abuse treatment program for [Swaim] by applying [Swaim] for acceptance intothe Sand Island Treatment Center and keeping updated as tothe status of [Swaim's] application. 
24. On January 18, 2011, Judge Lee followed his
prior sentencing inclination and instead of sending [Swaim]to prison to serve his open ten year term he sentenced[Swaim] to five years of HOPE probation with terms andconditions, which included serving one year of jail with 
5  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
early release to a substance abuse treatment program. 
25. On January 18, 2011, [Swaim] appeared before
Judge Alm for a hearing on the Motion for Revocation of
Probation that had been filed on October 15, 2010.  The motion was granted and Judge Alm also followed his priorresentencing inclination and instead of sending [Swaim] toprison to serve his open five year term he resentenced[Swaim] to another five year term of HOPE probation, with
one year of jail subject to early release to a substance
abuse treatment program. 
26. Between being sentenced on January 18, 2011, and
May 5, 2011, Mr. Harada continued his efforts to secure[Swaim's] acceptance and admission into a residentialsubstance abuse treatment program.  These efforts included submitting applications to and contacting treatment programssuch as Hina Mauka and Ho'omau Ke Ola and maintainingcontact with [Swaim's] probation officer Dwight Sakai toconfi[r]m what treatment programs would be acceptable to Mr.Sakai.  On or about May 5, 2011, [Swaim] was accepted andadmitted into the Ho'omau Ke Ola residential substance abuse treatment program. 
27.  After May 5, 2011, Mr. Harada relinquished
control over [Swaim's] cases to deputy public defenders inhis office who were handling HOPE probation cases. 
28. On January 8, 2013, the Office of the Public
Defender withdrew from representation of [Swaim] and RichardSing was appointed by the court as legal counsel for[Swaim]. 
29. On February 6, 2013, motions for revocation of
[Swaim's] probation in both cases were granted, and [Swaim]was resentenced to the indeterminate terms of imprisonmentof ten years in the burglary case and five years in thenegligent injury case. 
(Some emphasis added.) 
Based on these unchallenged findings, the Circuit Court 
reached the following conclusions, among others, which we 
construe as conclusions of law (COLs): 
39.  [Swaim] has failed to meet his burden of
establishing that Mr. Harada rendered ineffective assistance
of counsel. 
40.  [Swaim] has not established any specific errors
or omissions by Mr. Harada that reflect Mr. Harada's lack ofskill, judgment, or diligence in the handling of [Swaim's]cases. 
41.  Mr. Harada's advice to [Swaim] was within the
range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases. 
42.  Mr. Harada did not provide ineffective assistance
of counsel to [Swaim]. 
43.  [Swaim] entered his no contest plea to the charge
of Burglary in the First Degree in Case No. 1PC101001235voluntarily. 
44.  Mr. Harada did not coerce, threaten, or force
[Swaim] to enter his no contest pleas to the charge of 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Burglary in the First Degree in Case No. 1PC101001235. 
Accordingly, the Circuit Court concluded that Swaim's claims were 
without merit and denied the Petition.  This appeal followed. 
II.  Points of Error 
On appeal, Swaim contends that the Circuit Court erred 
in ruling that:  (1) Swaim did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel; and (2) Swaim's no contest plea was not obtained through coercion.  Relatedly, Swaim appears to challenge COLs 39 through 44. 
III.  Standards of Review 
"A trial court's conclusions of law are reviewed de 
novo under the right/wrong standard."  State v. Adler, 108 
Hawai# i 169, 174, 118 P.3d 652, 657 (2005).  "The denial of a 
Rule 40 petition based on the [circuit] court's conclusions of law is reviewed de novo."  Schwartz v. State, 136 Hawai# i 258, 
262, 361 P.3d 1161, 1165 (2015) (citing Coulter v. State, 116 Hawai# i 181, 184, 172 P.3d 493, 496 (2007)). 
IV.  
Discussion 
A.  Ineffective Assistance Claim 
Swaim contends that his Burglary One conviction must be 
vacated because he received ineffective assistance of counsel from Harada.   
"The standard for determining the adequacy of counsel's 
representation is whether, when viewed as a whole, the assistance provided is 'within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.'"  State v. Salavea, 147 
Hawai i # 564, 576, 465 
P.3d 1011, 1023 (2020) (quoting State v. Cordeiro, 99 Hawai# i 
390, 405, 56 P.3d 692, 707 (2002)).  The defendant has the burden of establishing ineffective assistance of counsel and must meet the following two-part test:  "First, a defendant must show that there were specific errors or omissions reflecting counsel's lack of skill, judgment, or diligence."  Id. (citing State v. Antone, 62 Haw. 346, 348, 615 P.2d 101, 104 (1980)).  "Second, the defendant must establish that these errors or omissions resulted 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
in either the withdrawal or substantial impairment of a 
potentially meritorious defense."  Id. (citing Antone, 62 Haw. at 348-49; 615 P.2d at 104). 
Specific actions or omissions that are alleged to be
erroneous but that had an obvious tactical basis for benefitting the defendant's case will not be subject tofurther scrutiny.  State v. Pacheco, 96 Hawai #i 83, 93, 26 
P.3d 572, 582 (2001).  If, however, the alleged error oromission had no obvious basis for benefitting the case andresulted in the withdrawal or impairment of a potentiallymeritorious defense, then the assistance of defendant's
counsel was constitutionally inadequate.  State v. Smith, 68
Haw. 304, 309-11, 712 P.2d 496, 500-01 (1986). 
Id. (footnote omitted); see Briones v. State, 74 Haw. 442, 463, 
848 P.2d 966, 977 (1993) ("An informed, tactical decision will rarely be second-guessed by judicial hindsight."). 
Swaim argues that Harada was ineffective because, 
"[r]ather than focusing his skill, judgment, and diligence on helping . . . Swaim fight and beat the Burglary [One] charge," Harada was instead focused on Swaim's prior negligent injury case, and "pleasing Judge Alm" in that case.  Swaim argues that he did not commit the crime of Burglary One, and that by not "presenting a meritorious defense, taking the case to trial, or attempting to downgrade the Burglary [One] charge to a Trespass," Harada made "specific errors" constituting ineffective assistance of counsel, and Swaim "received a harsher outcome" as a result.  
However, the unchallenged FOFs, which are binding on 
this court (see supra), do not support Swaim's arguments.  As reflected in FOF 17, one of Swaim's "most pressing concerns" was avoiding a prison term.  Even acquittal on the Burglary One charge would likely not have alleviated that concern, as Judge Alm had indicated to Harada the court's "strong inclination" to revoke Swaim's HOPE probation in the negligent injury case, and resentence him to an open five year term of imprisonment, even if Swaim were acquitted on the Burglary One charge.  See FOFs 12, 13.  It was only after Harada "advocated strongly for [Swaim] to be given another opportunity on probation" that "Judge Alm changed his initial inclination and told counsel that, if Swaim pled to the burglary case, he would revoke [Swaim's] probation, but sentence him to another term of HOPE probation, as long as 
8    
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
[Swaim] entered into a residential substance abuse treatment 
program.  FOF 14.  Judge Lee had also "told counsel that if [Swaim] pled to the burglary charge, he was inclined to sentence [Swaim] to probation with no further imprisonment if [Swaim] obtained substance abuse trea[t]ment."  FOF 11. 
It was in this context that Harada "discussed the 
burglary case in depth" with Swaim, "answered [Swaim's] questions[,]" "reviewed the facts of the case," and "explained possible defenses to the [Burglary One] charge[.]"  FOF 16.  And it was in this context that Harada advised Swaim that even though the burglary case was "winnable," given the sentencing and resentencing inclinations of Judges Lee and Alm if Swaim changed his plea in the burglary case, "the 'smart play' would be to plead no contest in the burglary case, as this would likely result in him being placed[] on probation and avoiding a prison term."  FOF 18.  Harada told Swaim, however, that "the choice to go to trial in the burglary case or to change his plea was his alone to make."  
Id. 
On this record, we conclude that Swaim has not shown 
any specific errors or omissions by Harada that reflect a lack of skill, judgment, or diligence in representing Swaim.  We further conclude that COLs 39 through 42 are not wrong.  Accordingly, the Circuit Court did not err in concluding that Swaim failed to meet his burden of establishing that Harada rendered ineffective assistance of counsel. 
B.  Coercion Claim 
Swaim contends that his Burglary One conviction must be 
vacated because his no contest plea was obtained through 
coercion.  He argues that he did not commit the crime of Burglary One and was coerced by Harada to change his plea to no contest "or else Mr. Swaim was going to go to prison for five years based on his prior Negligent Injury charge."
3/ 
3/ In his opening brief, Swaim also appears to suggest that Judge Alm
coerced him to enter his no contest plea in the burglary case.  Swaim did not 
raise this claim in the Petition or accompanying Memorandum of Law, whichreferred only to the Honolulu Prosecutor's Office and Swaim's "publicdefender" in connection with Swaim's coercion claim.  Similarly, Swaim did notcontend in his prior appeal that Judge Alm coerced him.  Accordingly, in Swaim 
9   
  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The unchallenged FOFs do not support Swaim's argument 
that Harada coerced him to enter his no contest plea.  Rather, 
the FOFs reflect that Harada informed Swaim of the sentencing and resentencing inclinations that Judges Lee and Alm, respectively, had provided at the September 15, 2010 conferences, and explained the risk of Swaim's being sent to prison in the negligent injury case.  FOF 17.  Given these circumstances and Swaim's pressing concern about a prison term, Harada advised Swaim that the "smart play" would be to plead no contest in the burglary case, which would likely avoid a prison term.  FOF 18.  However, Harada told Swaim that the decision was his alone to make.
4/  Id.  Swaim 
subsequently informed Harada that he had decided to follow Harada's advice and change his plea to no contest in the burglary case.  FOF 19.  Swaim points to no specific evidence in the record supporting his argument that Harada coerced or forced him to enter his no contest plea.
5/  See HRAP Rule 28(b)(7). 
On this record, we conclude that the Circuit Court did 
not err in concluding that Harada did not coerce, threaten or force Swaim to enter his no contest plea to the Burglary One charge.  We further conclude that COLs 43 and 44 are not wrong.
6/ 
V. Conclusion 
For the reasons discussed above, the February 21, 2021 
"Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying Petition 
I, this court remanded the case for an evidentiary hearing on Swaim's
contention that "his plea was coerced and he was forced to change his plea bycounsel."  Swaim I, 2020 WL 1698792, at *1 (emphasis added).  Swaim's new argument regarding Judge Alm was waived.  See HRPP Rule 40(a)(3). 
4/ At the evidentiary hearing, when Harada was asked if he forced or
pressured Swaim to make the decision to plead no contest, Harada tesified,"No."  When asked if he threatened Swaim in any way to choose to plead nocontest, Harada answered, "No."  When asked if Judge Alm forced, threatened,or coerced Swaim, Harada answered, "Judge Alm had no contact to my knowledge
with . . . Swaim up to this date[,]" i.e. , October 7, 2010, when Swaim pled no 
contest to the Burglary One charge. 
5/ In Swaim I, we concluded that Swaim's claim that he did not make
his no contest plea knowingly and intelligently was without merit.  2020 WL 
1698792, at *1.  Swaim did not seek certiorari review of this court's SDO regarding this ruling, thus waiving any argument not related to his claimsthat Harada provided ineffective assistance and coerced him to enter the plea. 
6/ To the extent that COL 44 is a mixed determination of fact and 
law, it is supported by substantial evidence and is not clearly erroneous.
