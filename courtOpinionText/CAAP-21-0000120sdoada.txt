The Griffiths raise three points of error on appeal, 
contending that the Circuit Court: (1) abused its discretion by 
failing to properly apply the "totality of the circumstances" 
approach and the factors identified in Troyer v. Adams,
 102 
Hawai i 399, 77 P.3d 83 (2003), in determining the settlement 
between Third-Party Defendants-Appellees Grant Kapono Kanoho 
(Kanoho) and Marcus & Associates, Inc. (together, MAI Defendants ) 
and Plaintiffs-Appellees Alan Sean Abad and Carolyn Kehaunani 
Abad (Abads) was made in good faith; (2) dismissing the 
Griffiths' direct claim against the MAI Defendants for breach of 
duty to disclose any known material fact; and (3) dismissing the 
Griffiths' direct claim against Defendants/Crossclaimants/ 
Crossclaim Defendants-Appellees James S. Farmer and Coldwell 
Banker Pacific Properties LLC (together, Coldwell Defendants ) for 
compensatory damages under Uyemura v. Wick, 57 Haw. 102, 551 P.2d 
171 (1976). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we 
resolve the Griffiths' points of error as follows: 
(1) The Griffiths argue that the Circuit Court abused 
its discretion when it granted the [MAI Defendants'] Petition for 
Determination of Good Faith Settlement (MAI Petition ), as it 
failed to follow the totality of the circumstances approach 
prescribed in Troyer, and instead relied on the absence of 
improper collusion between the settling parties. They contend 
the standard applied was based on language "not rooted in 
3          
      
 
       
      
           
       
         
         
           
            
           
     
        
          
       
           
          
         
         
          
         
            
        
        
          
        
          NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Troyer,"  which  constitutes  an  abuse  of  discretion  because  it 
"disregards  rules  or  principles  of  law  or  practice."  
The good faith
 settlement procedures "provid[e] courts 
with the opportunity to prevent collusive settlements aimed at 
injuring non-settling tortfeasors' interests." Troyer, 102 
Hawai i  at 427,  77 P.3d at 111. Consistent with Troyer, the 
"non-collusive" standard and the "totality of the circumstances" 
approach both require the court to consider whether there was 
evidence of wrongful conduct, among other factors. Befitel v. 
Lyckman , No. 30691, 2013 WL 1131612, at *3 (Haw. App. Mar. 18, 
2013) (mem. op.). The court is not required to enter findings of 
fact and conclusions of law related to its ruling on a petition 
for good faith settlement. Id. 
Here, the record reflects that the MAI Defendants and 
the Griffiths fully briefed and argued the Troyer factors to the 
Circuit Court, utilizing the totality of circumstances standard; 
there is nothing in the record to support a conclusion that the 
Circuit Court did not fully consider and weigh all of the 
evidence and arguments presented. The Griffiths relied in large 
part on allegations of collusion and improper purpose in opposing 
the MAI Petition. That the Circuit Court addressed the absence 
of improper collusion does not reflect a misapplication of the 
Troyer factors. See Troyer,
 102 Hawai i at 424, 77 P.3d at 108 
("[T]he totality of the circumstances approach permits the court 
to ferret out collusive settlements in which the settlement 
amount may not be the 'prime badge' of bad faith."). 
The
 Hawai i Supreme  Court held in Troyer that "the 
determination of whether a settlement is in good faith [is left] 
4          
           
        
             
           
      
         
           
          
     
       
         
         
        
         
        
         
       
         
         
        
         
         
         
   
      NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to the sound discretion of the trial court in light of the 
totality of the circumstances surrounding the settlement." Id. 
at 427, 77 P.3d at 111. We review the trial court's good faith 
determination for abuse of discretion. Id. at 434, 77 P.3d at 
118. The supreme court explained that: 
[T]he trial court may consider the following factors to the 
extent that they are known at the time of settlement: (1) 
the type of case and difficulty of proof at trial, e.g., 
rear-end motor vehicle collision, medical malpractice, 
product liability, etc.; (2) the realistic approximation of 
total damages that the plaintiff seeks; (3) the strength of 
the plaintiff's claim and the realistic likelihood of his or 
her success at trial; (4) the predicted expense of 
litigation; (5) the relative degree of fault of the settling 
tortfeasors; (6) the amount of consideration paid to settle 
the claims; (7) the insurance policy limits and solvency of 
the joint tortfeasors; (8) the relationship among the 
parties and whether it is conducive to collusion or wrongful 
conduct; and (9) any other evidence that the settlement is 
aimed at injuring the interests of a non-settling tortfeasor 
or motivated by other wrongful purpose. The foregoing list 
is not exclusive, and the court may consider any other 
factor that is relevant to whether a settlement has been 
given in good faith. 
Id. at 427, 77 P.3d at 111. 
As  noted  above,  all  of  these  factors  were  argued  to  the 
Circuit  Court  prior  to  its  determination.   There  is  no  indication 
or  argument  that  the  court  did  not  fully  consider  them.   Instead, 
the  Griffiths  invite  this  court  to  re-weigh  the  Troyer  factors 
and  conclude  that  the  factors  weigh  against  a  determination  that 
the  settlement  was  made  in  good  faith.   We  decline  to  do  so. 
On  appeal,  the  Griffiths  point  in  particular  to  the 
relationship  between  the  Abads  and  Kanoho,  and  what  the  Griffiths 
characterize  as  a  shared  litigation  strategy.   It  is  undisputed 
that  the  Abads  testified  that  they  considered  Kanoho  to  be  "a 
friend,"  but  the  record  also  shows  that  characterization  was 
qualified,  and  the  deposition  testimony  included  that  they  had 
not  been  in  contact  with  each  other  for  many  years  before  the 
Abads  selected  Kanoho  as  their  realtor.   Indeed,  considering  the 
5
          
  
      
         
         
         
          
         
         
         
      
         
         
       
           
         
     
         
       
      
         
          NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
genesis  of  this  dispute  –  that  the  Griffiths,  through  the 
Coldwell  Defendants,  sold  the  Abads  real  property  consisting  of  a 
condominium  unit  created  by  the  Griffiths,  upon  which  the  Abads 
could  not  lawfully  build  a  home  because  it  was  too  small  –  it  is 
not  surprising  or  inherently  improper  or  collusive  that  the  Abads 
would  initially  seek  to  work  with  their  own  agents,  the  MAI 
Defendants,  to  seek  redress  for  the  Abads,  rather  than  suing  the 
MAI  Defendants.   
The
 Griffiths also point to the MAI Defendants' "degree 
of fault" in not catching the "buildability" issue before the 
sale closed. However, Kanoho acknowledged his failures and paid 
a significant settlement amount. This issue was fully briefed 
before the Circuit Court, which weighed it along with the other 
factors presented in support of and against the MAI Petition. 
Upon review of the entirety of the record before the 
Circuit Court, we cannot conclude that the Circuit Court abused 
its discretion in granting the MAI Petition. 
(2) & (3) The Griffiths argue that their third-party 
claims against the MAI Defendants were not limited to indemnity 
and contribution claims, but included an independent, direct 
claim for breach of duty to disclose any known material facts to 
the Griffiths. Similarly, they argue that their breach of 
fiduciary duty and negligent misrepresentation crossclaims 
against the Coldwell Defendants raise direct claims for damages. 
The Griffiths characterize their direct claims against MAI 
Defendants and Coldwell Defendants (collectively, Realtors ) as 
"Uyemura " claims (Uyemura Claims). See Uyemura , 57 Haw. at 
108–09, 551 P.2d at 176 ("[W]here the wrongful act of the 
6

defendant has involved the plaintiff in litigation with others, 
. . . such expenses, including attorneys' fees, should be treated 
as the legal consequences of the original wrongful act, and may 
be recovered as damages."). The Griffiths argue that the Circuit 
Court erred in dismissing these direct Uyemura Claims because 
they are not in the nature of contribution or indemnity claims 
against a "joint tortfeasor" under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 
§ 663-15.5 (2016 & Supp. 2023), but seek their own damages, which 
are separate from the issue of the various joint tortfeasors' 
liability to the Abads. 
To resolve these arguments, we must consider whether 
HRS § 663-15.5 requires dismissal of only those crossclaims 
against the settling joint tortfeasor that seek indemnity or 
contribution for the plaintiff's injury, and if so, whether the 
Griffiths' Uyemura Claims are direct claims for their own injury, 
not in the nature of indemnity or contribution for the Abads' 
injury. We do not consider whether there is any merit to such 
claims. 
[T]he fundamental starting point for statutory 
interpretation is the language of the statute itself. 
Second, where the statutory language is plain and 
unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain 
and obvious meaning. Third, implicit in the task of 
statutory construction is our foremost obligation to 
ascertain and give effect to the intention of the 
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the 
language contained in the statute itself. Fourth, when 
there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or indistinctiveness 
or uncertainty of an expression used in a statute, an 
ambiguity exists. 
When there is ambiguity in a statute, the meaning of 
the ambiguous words may be sought by examining the context, 
with which the ambiguous words, phrases, and sentences may 
be compared, in order to ascertain their true meaning. 
Moreover, the courts may resort to extrinsic aids in 
determining legislative intent, such as legislative history, 
or the reason and spirit of the law.

HRS § 663-15.5 governs good faith settlements, and 
subsection (a) states: 
§  663-15.5   Release;  joint  tortfeasors;  co-obligors; 
good  faith  settlement.   (a)   A  release,  dismissal  with  or 
without  prejudice,  or  a  covenant  not  to  sue  or  not  to 
enforce  a  judgment  that  is  given  in  good  faith  under 
subsection  (b)  to  one  or  more  joint  tortfeasors,  or  to  one 
or  more  co-obligors  who  are  mutually  subject  to  contribution 
rights,  shall: 
(1) Not discharge any other joint tortfeasor or 
co-obligor not released from liability unless 
its terms so provide; 
(2) Reduce the claims against the other joint 
tortfeasor or co-obligor not released in the 
amount stipulated by the release, dismissal, or 
covenant, or in the amount of the consideration 
paid for it, whichever is greater; and 
(3) Discharge the party to whom it is given from all 
liability for any contribution to any other 
joint tortfeasor or co-obligor. 
(Emphasis added). 
HRS § 663-15.5(d) states: 
(d) A determination by the court that a settlement 
was made in good faith shall: 
(1) Bar any other joint tortfeasor or co-obligor 
from any further claims against the settling 
tortfeasor or co-obligor, except those based on 
a written indemnity agreement; and 
(2) Result in a dismissal of all cross-claims filed 
against the settling joint tortfeasor or 
co-obligor , except those based on a written 
indemnity agreement. 
(Emphasis added). 
HRS  §  663-15.5(a)  provides  that  a  good  faith  settlement 
"[d]ischarge[s]  the  party  to  whom  it  is  given  from  all  liability 
8
          
 
       
         NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
for  any  contribution  to  any  other  joint  tortfeasor  or 
co-obligor,"  not  necessarily  from  liability  to  any  co-defendant 
for  any  claim  raised  in  that  case.   Indeed,  the  Legislature  chose 
the  terms  "joint  tortfeasor"  and  "co-obligor,"  not  "party,"  "co-
party,"  "co-defendant,"  "crossclaim  defendant,"  or  "third  party 
defendant"  because  a  good  faith  settlement  under  HRS  §  663-15.5 
need  not  be  brought  in  an  action  where  litigation  is  pending 
against  joint  tortfeasor  defendants,  nor  do  the  non-settling 
joint  tortfeasors  need  to  be  made  parties  to  the  good  faith 
settlement  proceeding.   Abaya  v.  Mantell,  112  Hawai i  176,  183, 
145  P.3d  719,  726  (2006).   Given  further  that  HRS  §  663-11  (2016) 
defines  "joint  tortfeasor"  as  "two  or  more  persons  jointly  or 
severally  liable  in  tort  for  the  same  injury  to  person  or 
property,"  it  appears  "joint  tortfeasor"  under  the  statute  refers 
to  a  relationship  of  liability,  not  simply  a  relationship  of  co-
defendants.   Thus,  HRS  §  663-15.5(d)(2)'s  mandate  to  dismiss 
crossclaims  against  "the  settling  joint  tortfeasor  or  co-obligor" 
requires  dismissal  of  only  those  crossclaims  raised  in  the 
capacity  of  a  joint  tortfeasor  relationship,  i.e.,  as  persons  who 
may  be  jointly  or  severally  liable  in  tort  for  the  same  injury  to 
person  or  property.   Interpreting  HRS  §  663-15.5(d)(2)  as 
requiring  dismissal  of  all  crossclaims  against  a  settling  joint 
tortfeasor  party,  regardless  of  the  nature  of  the  claim,  may 
result  in  the  dismissal  of  permissive  crossclaims  relating  to  the 
same  transaction,  but  not  stemming  from  liability  for  the 
plaintiff's  injury.   
Reading
 all parts of HRS § 663-15.5 together, we 
conclude the trial court's approval of a good faith settlement

under  HRS  §  663-15.5(d)(2)  requires  dismissal  of  only  those 
crossclaims  against  a  settling  joint  tortfeasor  raised  in  the 
capacity  of  a  joint  tortfeasor,  i.e.,  those  seeking  contribution 
or  indemnity  (directly  or  indirectly)  for  the  injury  (to  the 
complainant)  that  is  the  subject  of  the  good  faith  settlement. 
Next,
 we examine, for this limited purpose, the nature 
of the Griffiths' claims against the Realtors, i.e., to consider 
whether they seek contribution or indemnity for the original 
injury to Abads, as opposed to relief for alleged direct injuries 
to the Griffiths. 
In Uyemura , the developer's realtors sold the same lot 
to two different buyers, Uyemura and the Chungs. 57 Haw. at 105, 
551 P.2d at 174. Only the Chungs obtained title from the 
developer, so Uyemura sued the developer, its realtors, and the 
Chungs for specific performance and damages. Id. at 106-07, 551 
P.2d at 174-75. The Chungs cross-claimed against the developer 
and its realtors for attorneys' fees and costs incurred in 
defending Uyemura's claim, which the trial court awarded. Id. 
The supreme court upheld the award of attorneys' fees and costs 
to the Chungs, reasoning that the Chungs raised a fraudulent 
concealment claim against the developer and its realtors for 
concealing that litigation was pending or imminent in regards to 
their ability to sell the property to the Chungs, which 
ultimately caused the Chungs to become involved in litigation 
against Uyemura. Id. at 110, 551 P.2d at 176. Thus, the Chungs 
were entitled to an award of damages from the developer and its 
realtors in the form of attorneys' fees and costs incurred in 
defending against Uyemura's claim. Id.

Here, count 4 of the Third-Party Complaint against the 
MAI Defendants and counts 1 and 2 of the Crossclaim against the 
Coldwell Defendants put the respective Realtors on notice that 
the Griffiths seek damages for independent tortious acts 
committed against the Griffiths, i.e., the Realtors' respective 
failure to catch the alleged buildability issue and warn the 
Griffiths of it prior to the sale closing. Though Paragraph 2 of 
the respective prayers for relief in the Third-Party Complaint 
and Crossclaim seek an award of attorneys' fees and costs if the 
Abads are "entitled to judgment against Dr. and Mrs. Griffith," 
paragraph 5 of the prayers for relief make separate, unqualified 
requests for attorneys' fees and costs that are not tied to the 
Griffiths' liability to the Abads. Thus, we conclude that the 
Griffiths sufficiently pled Uyemura Claims for attorneys' fees 
and costs against the Realtors, which are direct claims, not in 
the nature of indemnity or contribution. Accordingly, we 
conclude that the Circuit Court erred in dismissing those claims 
under HRS § 663-15.5(d)(2). 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's August 26, 2024 
Final Judgment, April 7, 2021 Order Granting MAI Petition, and 
January 3, 2023 Order Granting Coldwell Petition are affirmed in 
part and vacated in part; this case is remanded to the Circuit 
Court for further proceedings consistent with this Summary 
Disposition Order.
