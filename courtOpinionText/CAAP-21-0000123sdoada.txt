SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
This appeal challenges whether summary judgment was 
properly granted under the res judicata doctrine. 
Self-represented Plaintiff-Appellant William H. 
Gilliam (
Gilliam) appeals from the February 8, 2021 "Order 
Granting Defendants Joan Cherice Krussel and Mathew A. Cote's 
Motion for Summary Judgment and Motion for Rule 11 Sanctions Against [Gilliam]" (Order Granting MSJ and Sanctions); April 30,

2021 "Order Granting to Defendants Joan Cherice Krussel and 
Mathew A. Cote Award of Rule 11 Sanctions and Fees Against 
[Gilliam]" (Order Awarding Sanctions); and (3) May 26, 2021 Judgment, all filed and entered by the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit (Circuit Court).
1 
Upon review of the record on appeal and relevant legal 
authorities, giving due consideration to the issues raised and arguments advanced by the parties, we vacate and remand. 
On appeal, Gilliam appears to contend
2 that the Circuit 
Court erred by (1) granting summary judgment by applying res 
judicata; (2) awarding Hawai‘ i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) 
Rule 11 sanctions; (3) denying his request for a continuance to 
conclude discovery under HRCP Rule 56(f); and (4) denying his motion to amend the complaint. We conclude Gilliam's first contention regarding res judicata has merit and is dispositive. 
On February 13, 2020, Gilliam filed a Complaint 
against Defendants-Appellees Susan Gail Galvin as Personal Representative of Michael J. Galvin (Galvin), Joan Cherice Krussel now known as Joan Cherice Cote (Joan), and Matt Cote 
also known as Mathew A. Cote (Matt) (Joan and Matt collectively 
referred to as the Cotes), alleging various claims related to the March 2015 posting of a defamatory and slanderous review 
1 The Honorable Randal G.B. Valenciano presided. 
2 Gilliam raises eleven points of error (POEs) that are difficult 
to discern and do not comply with Hawai‘i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 
Rule 28(b)(4). Despite Gilliam's noncompliance with HRAP Rule 28, we 
endeavor to " afford [] litigants the opportunity to have their cases heard on 
the merits, where possible." Marvin v. Pflueger
, 127 Hawai‘i 490, 496, 280 
P.3d 88, 94 (2012) (cleaned up). To promote access to justice, we interpret 
pleadings prepared by self- represented litigants liberally and attempt to 
afford them appellate review even though they fail to comply with court 
rules. See 
Erum v. Llego
, 147 Hawai‘i 368, 380- 81, 465 P.3d 815, 827- 28 
(2020). Accordingly, Gilliam's eleven POEs are consolidated and restated to 
the extent they are discernible.

regarding Gilliam's condominium, which was posted on Airbnb, a 
website that allows persons to rent out their homes on a short-
term basis. 
On December 1, 2020, the Cotes filed a Motion for 
Summary Judgment (
MSJ), arguing that Gilliam's claims were 
barred under res judicata because the "claims were previously dismissed with prejudice in 2015" by the District Court of the 
Fifth Circuit, Small Claims Division, State of 
Hawai‘i (District 
Court
) in Civil No. 5SC151000192 (Small Claims Case). The MSJ 
attached the following documents from the Small Claims Case: 
Gilliam's "Statement of Claim and Notice" against Joan for "[f]raud" and "deceit" in "May, 2015"; Joan's motion to dismiss; and a December 21, 2015 "Order Granting [Joan]'s Motion to Dismiss" with prejudice, which noted Gilliam's failure to file any reply or opposition and to appear at the hearing on the motion to dismiss. 
The Cotes also filed a "Motion for Rule 11 Sanctions 
Against [Gilliam]" (Motion for Sanctions), arguing that Gilliam's Complaint violated HRCP Rule 11(b)(1) and (2); that 
Gilliam's claims were precluded by res judicata; and that 
sanctions of attorney's fees were warranted. 
Gilliam opposed the MSJ and Motion for Sanctions, 
arguing, inter alia, that res judicata did not apply; the Small Claims Case only named Joan as a defendant, not Matt; and requested "sufficient time to conclude discovery" under HRCP Rule 56(f). 
On January 14, 2021, the Circuit Court conducted a 
hearing on the MSJ and Motion for Sanctions, and granted both.

On February 8, 2021, the Circuit Court filed the Order 
Granting MSJ and Sanctions, which stated that: all of Gilliam's 
claims in the present action were precluded by res judicata in light of the Small Claims Case; Gilliam failed to demonstrate that discovery would enable him to rebut the Cotes' showing of the absence of a material fact; because Gilliam refused to withdraw his claims after the Cotes brought the res judicata preclusion to his attention under HRCP Rule 11(c), the Cotes were entitled to an award of "their reasonable attorneys' fees and other expenses incurred as a direct result of [Gilliam]'s violation of Rule 11"; and the Cotes "shall submit" a declaration regarding their reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, upon which the court would determine the amount to 
award. 
On March 11, 2021, Gilliam filed a Notice of Appeal 
(Notice) from the February 8, 2021 Order Granting MSJ and 
Sanctions. 
On April 30, 2021, the Circuit Court issued the Order 
Awarding Sanctions, awarding the Cotes $29,198.48 of attorneys' fees as Rule 11 sanctions. 
On May 26, 2021, the Circuit Court entered an HRCP 
Rule 54(b)-certified Judgment in favor of the Cotes and against Gilliam on the claims against the Cotes in the Complaint.

On June 25, 2021, Gilliam filed an Amended Notice of 
Appeal (Amended Notice) from the February 8, 2021 Order Granting 
that "in the absence of any evidentiary hearing, [he] deems no transcript 
necessary or available herein." 
4 Gilliam's claims against defendant Galvin were resolved by orders 
granting Galvin's 2023 motions for summary judgment, which are the subject of 
a separate appeal, CAAP- 24-000033.  We denied Gilliam's October 1, 2024 
motions to consolidate both appeals for the reasons set forth in our October 8, 2024 order.

MSJ and Sanctions; April 30, 2021 Order Awarding Sanctions; and 
the May 26, 2021 Judgment. 
Jurisdiction 
The Cotes argue that this court lacks appellate 
jurisdiction because the initial Notice appealed from the February 8, 2021 Order Granting MSJ and Sanctions, which is a "non-appealable interlocutory order." The Cotes claim that Gilliam's Notice is not "considered as filed immediately after" the May 26, 2021 Judgment under HRAP Rule 4(a)(2), because the Order Granting MSJ and Sanctions "is not an 'announcement'" of the Order Awarding Sanctions and Judgment. The Cotes argue that while Gilliam filed the June 25, 2021 Amended Notice after the April 30, 2021 Order Awarding Sanctions and May 26, 2021 
Judgment, the Amended Notice "relates back to the filing date of 
the original [N]otice." 
HRAP Rule 4(a)(2), entitled "Premature Filing of 
Appeal," states: "If a notice of appeal is filed afterannouncement of a decision but before entry of the judgment or order, such notice shall be considered as filed immediately after the time the judgment or order becomes final for the purpose of appeal." (Emphases added.) 
Here, the Circuit Court announced its decision to 
grant the Cotes' MSJ and Motion for Sanctions in its February 8, 2021 Order Granting MSJ and Sanctions. On May 26, 2021, the Circuit Court entered Judgment "[p]ursuant to" the February 8, 2021 Order Granting MSJ and Sanctions. The Judgment contained 
the necessary language for certification under HRCP Rule 54(b). 
Thus, although Gilliam prematurely filed the March 11, 2021 Notice "after [the] announcement" of the Circuit Court's decision to grant the MSJ and Motion for Sanctions, the Notice is "considered as filed immediately after" the May 26, 2021

Judgment, and we have jurisdiction over this appeal, including 
the April 30, 2021 Order Awarding Sanctions. See HRAP Rule 
4(a)(2); Ueoka v. Szymanski, 107 Hawai‘ i 386, 396, 114 P.3d 892, 
902 (2005) ("An appeal from a final judgment 'brings up for 
review all interlocutory orders not appealable directly as of right which deal with issues in the case.'" (citation omitted)). 
(1) While Gilliam's arguments are difficult to 
discern, Gilliam appears to argue, inter alia, that the Small Claims Case was "not of competent jurisdiction [sic] for application of res judicata"; Matt was "not a party" to the Small Claims Case; Gilliam "could not appeal" from the Small Claims Case; and the Small Claims Case has "no preclusive effect." The Cotes argue that the elements of res judicata were met.  
"We review a circuit court's grant or denial of 
summary judgment de novo under the same standard applied by the 
circuit court." Makila Land Co., LLC v. Kapu, 152 Hawai‘ i 112, 
119-20, 522 P.3d 259, 266-67 (2022) (citation omitted). 
"Application of res judicata is a question of law. 
Questions of 
law are reviewed de novo under the right/wrong standard." 
PennyMac Corp. v. Godinez, 148 Hawai‘ i 323, 327, 474 P.3d 264, 
268 (2020) (citation omitted). 
"Res judicata, or claim preclusion," is a doctrine 
that "limit[s] a litigant to one opportunity to litigate 
aspects of the case to prevent inconsistent results and multiplicity of suits and to promote finality and judicial 
economy." Bremer v. Weeks
, 104 Hawai‘i 43, 53, 85 P.3d 150, 160 
(2004) (citation omitted). 
Res judicata "prohibits a party from 
relitigating a previously adjudicated cause of action" and also 
precludes the relitigation "of all grounds of claim and defense 
6  
           
 
  
   
 
    
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
which might have been properly litigated in the first action but 
were not litigated or decided." Id. at 53, 85 P.3d at 160 
(cleaned up). The party asserting res judicata has the burden 
of establishing the following: "(1) there was a final judgment on the merits [(Element No.1)], (2) both parties are the same or in privity with the parties in the original suit [(Element No.2)], and (3) the claim decided in the original suit is identical with the one presented in the action in question [(Element No.3)]." Id. at 54, 85 P.3d at 161. 
  As to Element No.1, the Hawai‘ i Supreme Court recently 
held that res judicata is inapplicable where there is a dismissal order with prejudice, but no final judgment entered. See Saplan v. U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n as Tr. for BAFC 2007-A, 
154 
Hawai‘i 181, 188-90, 549 P.3d 266, 273-75 (2024) ("Because 
there was no separate final judgment filed, th[e] matter was not 
finally adjudicated on the merits." (citation omitted)). The supreme court concluded that, "[w]ithout a final judgment, . . . [this court] and [the] circuit court both erred to the extent they suggested that the dismissal of the 2011 action was 'on the merits' for the purpose of claim preclusion." Id. at 189, 549 P.3d at 274 (emphasis added). 
Here, the Cotes assert that "the dismissal with 
prejudice of the Small Claims Case was a final judgment on the merits."
5 The MSJ attached a dismissal order with prejudice, but 
no final judgment. Hawai‘ i District Court Rules of Civil 
5 In their MSJ below and on appeal, the Cotes rely on Land v. 
Highway Const. Co., Ltd., 64 Haw. 545, 551, 645 P.2d 295, 299 (1982), to 
argue that "a dismissal with prejudice 'is an adjudication on the merits.'" 
In Land, however, after the dismissal order was filed, there was a final 
judgment entered on the merits. Id. at 551, 645 P.2d at 299 ("After final 
judgment was entered, we believe that this order became an adjudication on 
the merits of the cross- claims.").

Procedure Rule 58, entitled "Entry of Judgment," provides in 
pertinent part: "The filing of the judgment in the office of 
the clerk constitutes the entry of the judgment; and the judgment is not effective before such entry." (Emphasis added.) Thus, the Circuit Court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of the Cotes based on res judicata, where there was no "final judgment on the merits" in the Small Claims Case, and 
Element No.1 was not met. See Saplan, 154 Hawai‘ i at 188-89, 
549 P.3d at 273-74; Makila Land Co., LLC, 152 Hawai
‘i at 119-20, 
522 P.3d at 266-67; PennyMac Corp., 148 Hawai‘ i at 327, 474 P.3d 
at 268. In light of our disposition, we do not address the 
remaining res judicata elements. 
(2) Because summary judgment was erroneously granted, 
the Circuit Court acted outside the scope of its discretion in granting HRCP Rule 11 sanctions. See Gap v. Puna Geothermal
Venture, 106 Hawai‘ i 325, 331, 104 P.3d 912, 918 (2004) ("All 
aspects of a HRCP Rule 11 determination should be reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard." (citation omitted)). 
In light of our disposition, we need not address 
Gilliam's remaining contentions.
