 Kwolek pled no contest to Counts 2-7, 10, and 12.  Based on the 
no-contest plea, the circuit court entered an "Amended Judgment; 
Conviction and Sentence; Notice of Entry" sentencing Kwolek to, inter alia, a ten-year term of imprisonment in each of Counts 2, 4, 6, and 10, and a five-year term of imprisonment in each of Counts 3, 5, 7, and 12, all terms to run concurrently.  The remaining counts were dismissed with prejudice pursuant to the plea deal. 
On June 4, 2019, the Hawaiʻ i Paroling Authority (HPA) 
held a hearing to determine Kwolek's minimum term(s) of imprisonment.  On July 1, 2019, HPA issued a Notice and Order of Fixing Minimum Term(s) of Imprisonment (Imprisonment Order),

Count 13:  Promoting a Detrimental Drug in the Second Degree, in violation of HRS § 712- 1248(1)(c) (2014) as to 
marijuana;

 setting Kwolek's level of punishment at II for all counts and 
setting a minimum term of four years and six months for Counts 
2, 4, 6, and 10, and a minimum term of three years for Counts 3, 5, 7, and 12, running concurrently.  HPA later reduced each minimum term by six months. 
On September 16, 2020, Kwolek filed the Petition 
asserting three grounds for relief and requesting parole with credit for time served.  The three grounds asserted were as follows: 
Ground One
: "HPA acted arbitrarily and capriciously 
in it's [sic] finding for Level II Punishment when 
facts on record and evidence adduced at HPA minimum hearing only support Level I Punishment," violating 
the due process and equal protection clauses, 
Hawaiʻi 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 706-669(8), Hawaiʻ i 
Administrative Rules (HAR) § 23-700-24, and the 
Guidelines for Establishing Minimum Terms of Imprisonment (Guidelines). 
Ground Two
: "HPA gave a simple enumeration of 
guideline criteria in it's [sic] Order of Fixing Minimum Term with no written justification required by law," violating the Guidelines, "Notes to Decision HRS 
§ 706-662," "Notes to Decision HRS § 91-12," and HAR 
§ 23-700-22(k). Ground Three: "HPA precluded effective assistance of counsel by withholding fact/information to finding of fact and conclusion or the nondisclosure of adverse information considered for reasoned decision making," 
violating his right to due process and assistance of NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
 
5 
 counsel, HAR §§ 23-700-22(e) and (g), and HRS §§ 706-
669(2) and (3). 
The circuit court denied the Petition, concluding that 
Kwolek's "claims are patently frivolous and without support in 
the record or in the evidence he submitted, he is not entitled to a hearing on his Petition." 
On appeal, Kwolek raises twelve points of error: 
(A)  "The [Hawai‘i] Legislature has not delegated it's 
[sic] authority to the HPA to prescribe a range of 
minimum terms of imprisonment, make their own 
findings based on subjectivity, ignoring substantial evidence . . . , and set a[n] increased minimum punishment range."   
(B)
  "Assuming that HPA can prescribe a range for minimum 
term sentence, HPA's sentencing of minimum term based 
on variable Level's [sic] of Punishment, and minimum term ranges within Level's [sic] of Punishment increases the punitive penalty for the crime.  Making uniform determination[s] virtually 
 impossible." 
(C)
  "HPA ignored and violated it's [sic] guidelines and administrative rules in setting Petitioner's minimum term, acting arbitrarily and capriciously." 
(D)
  "HPA failed to follow rules and statutes in setting of minimum terms that were established and applied to 
other similarly situated prisoners providing uniform 
determination of minimum terms."   
(E)  "[HRS § 706-669(8)], delegating authority to HPA to 
prescribe the minimum period of incarceration & establishing parole eligibility serves as a 
procedural protection to safeguard prisoners [sic] 
rights.  Consequently, [HRS
 § 706-669(8)] is 
unconstitutionally vague, leaving HPA to it's [sic] 
own devices.  Thus setting minimum terms in an arbitrary and capricious manner."  
(F)
  "HPA Guidelines also serv[e] as a procedural protection to safeguard prisoners [sic] rights.  Conversely, there is no rational basis and is [sic] procedurally inadequate to provide a uniform 
determination of sentencing.  Using subjectivity as a 
'Back Door' to arbitrary and capricious determination of minimum sentences.  Even in the event of substantial evidence, Judicial and Prosecutor's recommendations providing concrete facts to a 
specific Level of punishment and range within that NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
 
6 
 Level of Punishment (Level I Punishment of 18 
months)."   
(G)
  "HPA Guidelines and Administrative Rules providing all deviations and increase Level of Punishment with 
written justification to the [Imprisonment Order].  This never being produced, absent, or lacking findings of fact for reasoned decision making on Petitioner's [Imprisonment Order.]" 
(H)  "HPA setting Petiti
oner's minimum term based on the 
significant factors of 'Character & Attitude with Respect to Criminal Activity or Lifestyle' and 'Efforts Made to Live Pro- Social Life Prior to 
Commitment to Prison' this being completely contradictory to all evidence/fact adduced at the minimum hearing." 
(I)
  "HPA violating [HRS § 706-669(8)] by ignoring 
Petitioner's criminal history, this being his first felony offense, and disreguarding [sic] all statements & referrals provided by the State and 
community support expressing Petitioner's excellent 
character & attitude with efforts to live pro-socially prior to incarceration." 
(J)  "HPA clearly using [sic] some other adverse 
information in determination of Petitioner's minimum 
sentence.  If HPA is a 'quasi
-judic[i]al' body some 
evidence to redure [sic] increase Level of Punishment 
must have been used.  A pur[e]ly subjective decision is blatantly a[n] arbitrary & capricious manner in reason decision making, being a violation.  So if 
adverse information was used, it was never disclosed 
to Petitioner or his cou[n]sel prior to the minimum hearing.  Giving him adequate time to prepare and rebut.  This resulting in ineffective assist[a]nce."   
(K)  "The Second Circuit Court . . . abuse[d] [its] 
discretion and it's [sic] lack of due d
iligence in 
thourghly [sic] review the facts and standards of review argued in Petitioner's H.R.P.P. Rule 40."   
(L)  "The Circuit Court erred by simply 'rubber stamping' the Deputy Attorney General's Order Denying a Hearing and excluding the 
Circuit Courts [sic] own Finding of 
Facts that would explain it's [sic] shifted point of view from it's [sic] original recommendations and facts on record."
   
(Emphasis added.)
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted, and having given due consideration to the issues 
raised and the arguments advanced by the parties, we resolve Kwolek's points of error below, and vacate and remand.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 Kwolek's Point of Error J warrants a hearing.  Kwolek 
alleges that HPA considered adverse information in making his 
minimum imprisonment term determination but did not disclose the information to Kwolek's counsel before the June 4, 2019 hearing, which rendered her assistance ineffective.  Kwolek appears to reason that HPA must have considered some adverse information in order to categorize him as a Level II offender as opposed to a Level I offender. 
Under HRPP Rule 40(f), the circuit court must grant a 
hearing if the allegations in an HRPP Rule 40 petition would entitle a petitioner to relief if proven, and may deny a hearing where the claim is patently frivolous: 
If a petition alleges facts that if proven would 
entitle the petitioner to relief, the court shall grant a 
hearing which may extend only to the issues raised in the 
petition or answer.  However, the court may deny a hearing 
if the petitioner's claim is patently frivolous and is without trace of support either in the record or from other evidence submitted by the petitioner. . . . 
 The petitioner shall have a full and fair evidentiary 
hearing on the petition.  The court shall receive all evidence that is relevant and necessary to determine the petition, including affidavits, depositions, oral 
testimony, certificate of any judge who presided at any 
hearing during the course of the proceedings which led to the judgment or custody which is the subject of the 
petition, and relevant and necessary portions of the transcripts of prior proceedings. . . . 
 Where the petition alleges the ineffective assistance 
of counsel as a ground upon which the requested relief should be granted, the petitioner shall serve written notice of the hearing upon the counsel whose assistance is 
alleged to have been ineffective and said counsel shall 
have an opportunity to be heard.

 The Hawaiʻi Supreme Court has explained that a hearing 
must be held where the petition states a "colorable claim": 
As a general rule, a hearing should be held on a Rule 40 
petition for post- conviction relief where the petition 
states a colorable claim.  To establish a colorable claim, 
the allegations of the petition must show that if taken as 
true the facts alleged would change the verdict, however, a 
petitioner's conclusions need not be regarded as true.  
Where examination of the record of the trial court's proceedings indicates that the petitioner's allegations show no colorable claim, it is not error to deny the 
petition without a hearing.  The question on appeal of a 
denial of a Rule 40 petition without a hearing is whether 
the trial record indicates that Petitioner's application 
for relief made such a showing of a colorable claim as to 
require a hearing before the lower court.   
 
Rapozo v. State, 150 Hawaiʻi 66, 77-78, 497 P.3d 81, 92-93 (2021) 
(emphases added and citations omitted). 
  Here, the circuit court concluded that Kwolek failed to show HPA withheld any information, that counsel was not ineffective, and Kwolek's claims were patently frivolous.  
Conclusions of Law 4 through 6 in the Order state: 
4.  Petitioner has failed to show that the HPA 
withheld information, adverse or otherwise, that it 
considered when setting Petitioner's level of punishment and his minimum terms from he [sic] or his counsel.  
5.  Petitioner's counsel did not provide ineffective 
assistance to him at his sentencing or his minimum hearing before the HPA.  
6.  As Petitioner's claims are patently frivolous and 
without support in the record or in the evidence he 
submitted, he is not entitled to a hearing on his Petition.  
 
 
The record shows HPA categorized Kwolek as a Level II 
offender.  The record, however, does not reflect what 
information was in Kwolek's file or what information the HPA NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
 
9 
 provided Kwolek before his June 4, 2019 hearing.  The record 
also does not contain a transcript of the June 4, 2019 hearing.     
Thus, there was insufficient information in the record 
for the circuit court, and this court, to determine whether 
Kwolek's claim that HPA failed to provide him adverse information was patently frivolous.  See Star v. State, 
No. CAAP-17-0000642, 2018 WL 4327325 at *4-*6 (App. Sept. 11, 2018) (SDO) (explaining where the record did "not contain transcripts . . . of the HPA proceeding, nor copies of what was 
provided to Star, nor what was in his HPA file," the record was 
"insufficient to address the question of whether HPA considered adverse information that was not provided to Star in advance of the hearing").       
In advance of the hearing, HPA was required to provide  
Kwolek with adverse information in their HPA file.  De La Garza 
v. State, 129 Hawai‘ i 429, 442, 302 P.3d 697, 710 (2013).  And 
the State was required to provide a sufficient record to the circuit court so it could address whether HPA considered adverse information and whether the adverse information was provided to Kwolek.  See Star, No. CAAP-17-0000642, 2018 WL 4327325 at *4-
*6; HRPP Rule 40(d) (providing in part that the "respondent shall file with its answer any records that are material to the questions raised in the petition which are not included in the petition"). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
 
10 
   If Kwolek's claim that HPA considered adverse 
information without providing it to him in advance of the June 4, 
2019 hearing is taken as true, Kwolek presents a colorable 
claim.  See Star, 2018 WL 4327325 at *6.  Because there was 
insufficient information to determine whether HPA considered adverse information and whether HPA provided that information to Kwolek, Conclusions of Law 4 through 6 were wrong.   
We therefore remand this case to the circuit court for 
a hearing to further develop the record.  See De La Garza, 129 
Hawai‘i at 443, 302 P.3d at 711 ("In the absence of sufficient 
evidence in the record on appeal, an appellate court should remand for the development of such a record.") (citation and 
internal quotation marks omitted).  Because Kwolek's Points of 
Error H, I, and K also appear to be evidence-related claims, we do not address them further; the circuit court may determine on remand whether these evidence-related claims were also implicated by HPA's alleged consideration of adverse evidence that was not provided to Kwolek. 
Moreover, the record does not reflect that Kwolek 
served his hearing counsel with a copy of the Petition, as 
required by HRPP Rule 40(f) for ineffective assistance of 
counsel claims.  See Clement v. State, 146 Hawai‘ i 119, 456 P.3d 
192, No. CAAP-17-0000736, 2020 WL 502157 at *3 (App. Jan. 30, 
2020) (SDO).  If Kwolek maintains his ineffective assistance of NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
 
11 
 counsel claim on remand, he must serve his hearing counsel with 
a copy of the Petition. 
Finally, Kwolek's remaining points of error are waived 
or there was no colorable claim.  Points of Error B, E, and F 
are new claims Kwolek did not raise below and, thus, are waived.  HRPP Rule 40(a)(3) (providing in part that "[e]xcept for a claim of illegal sentence, an issue is waived if the petitioner knowingly and understandingly failed to raise it and it could have been raised . . . in a prior proceeding actually initiated 
under this rule, and the petitioner is unable to prove the 
existence of extraordinary circumstances to justify the petitioner's failure to raise the issue").  And as to the remaining points of error, the circuit court did not err in denying the petition "based on no showing of a colorable claim 
. . . ."  Maddox v. State, 141 Hawai‘ i 196, 202, 407 P.3d 152, 
158 (2017) ("Whether the trial court erred in denying a Rule 40 
petition without a hearing based on no showing of a colorable claim is reviewed de novo; thus, the right/wrong standard of review is applicable.") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).   
Based on the foregoing, the circuit court's 
February 12, 2021 "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying Without a Hearing Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner From Custody" is NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
