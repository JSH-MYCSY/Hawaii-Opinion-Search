STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, 
v. 
MICHAEL LUNGOCI, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
HONOLULU DIVISION 
(CASE NO.  1DTA-20-00722) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Wadsworth and Nakasone, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Michael Lungoci (Lungoci) appeals 
from the February 16, 2021 Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or 
Order and Plea/Judgment (Judgment), entered by the District Court 
of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division (District Court).1 
On March 11, 2020, Lungoci was charged by complaint 
with Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant, in 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 291E-61(a)(1), 
(b)(1).2  Lungoci requested to dismiss the case based on, inter 
1 The Honorable James C. McWhinnie presided. 
2 HRS ยง 291E-61 (Supp. 2019), entitled "Operating a vehicle under
the influence of an intoxicant," provides in pertinent part: 
(a)  A person commits the offense of operating a
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates or assumes actual physical control ofa vehicle: 
(1)  While under the influence of alcohol in an 
amount sufficient to impair the person's normal mentalfaculties or ability to care for the person and guard
against casualty[.] 
(continued...)  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
alia, "the length of this case[.]"  On February 16, 2021, the 
District Court dismissed the case without prejudice. 
Lungoci raises a single point of error on appeal, 
arguing that the District Court erred in dismissing the case without prejudice or, at the very least, the case should be vacated and remanded for findings in support of dismissing with or without prejudice.  While Plaintiff-Appellee State of 
Hawai# i 
(State) argues that the District Court did not abuse its 
discretion in dismissing the case without prejudice, the State 
"acknowledges" that the District Court did not indicate its reasons for dismissing the case without prejudice and did not affirmatively state that it considered the 
Estencion3 factors and 
then clearly articulate its findings on the record. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve Lungoci's point of error as follows, and vacate and remand for findings. 
"In criminal cases, 'the power of a court to dismiss a 
case on its own motion for failure to prosecute with due diligence is inherent.'"  State v. Mageo, 78 
Hawai# i 33, 37, 889 
P.2d 1092, 1096 (App. 1995) (emphasis and brackets omitted) (quoting Estencion, 63 Haw. at 268, 625 P.2d at 1043).  A trial court has the inherent power to dismiss a charge with or without prejudice, but must clearly articulate the reasons for its

. . . . 
(b)  A person committing the offense of operating a
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant shall be sentenced without possibility of probation orsuspension of sentence as follows: 
(1)  For the first offense, or any offense not
preceded within a ten-year period by a conviction foran offense under this section or section 291E-4(a)[.]  
3 See State v. Estencion, 63 Haw. 264, 269, 625 P.2d 1040, 1044
(1981) (dismissal with or without prejudice for violation of HRPP Rule 48requires consideration of: "the seriousness of the offense; the facts and thecircumstances of the case which led to the dismissal; and the impact of areprosecution on the administration of this chapter and on the administrationof justice.").

decision so that a reviewing court may accurately assess whether 
the trial court duly exercised its discretion.  See id. at 37-38, 889 P.2d at 1096-97; see also State v. Hern, 133 
Hawai# i 59, 64, 
323 P.3d 1241, 1246 (App. 2013), abrogated on other grounds by State v. McKeown, No. CAAP-19-0000607, 2021 WL 2182355, at *1 (App. May 28, 2021) (holding that in determining whether to dismiss a charge with or without prejudice under Hawai# i Rules of 
Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 48(b), the trial court must "clearly 
articulate the effect of the . . . factors [set forth in 
Estencion, 63 Haw. at 269, 625 P.2d at 1044] and any other factor it considered in rendering its decision"). 
Here, the District Court did not provide any 
explanation for its decision to dismiss the case without prejudice.  We conclude that the record in this case is inadequate for this court to meaningfully review whether the District Court properly exercised its discretion in dismissing the case without prejudice.  See Hern, 113 
Hawai# i at 64, 323 
P.3d at 1246. 
For the foregoing reasons, the February 16, 2021 Notice 
of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment is vacated, and this case is remanded to the District Court to enter appropriate findings to support its decision to dismiss without prejudice and for further proceedings as may be necessary consistent with this Summary Disposition Order.
