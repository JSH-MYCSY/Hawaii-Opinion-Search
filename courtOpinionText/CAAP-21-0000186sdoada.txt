SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Wadsworth, Nakasone, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Punohu Kekaualua III (Kekaualua) 
appeals from the April 1, 2021 Final Judgment (Judgment) entered 
by the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit (Circuit Court)1 in 
favor of Plaintiff-Appellee Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, 
d/b/a Christiana Trust as Owner Trustee of the Residential Credit Opportunities Trust III (Wilmington Savings).  Kekaualua also 
challenges the Circuit Court's April 1, 2021 Findings of Fact; 
Conclusions of Law; Order Granting [Wilmington Savings's] Motion for Summary Judgment and Order for Declaratory Relief, Injunctive

Relief, Expungement of Unauthorized Recorded Instrument and Other 
Relief Filed January 15, 2021 [(Motion for Relief)]; Exhibit "A" 
(Expungement Order). 
Kekaualua raises five points of error on appeal, 
contending that the Circuit Court erred by:  (1) granting the 
Motion for Relief based upon inadmissible evidence and in spite of the existence of genuine issues of material fact; (2) inter alia, taking judicial notice of pleadings/filings in separate court cases; (3) rejecting Kekaualua's request for a continuance so that he could obtain a Hawaiian language interpreter to translate documents from the Great Mahele and then prepare a response; (4) summarily denying Kekaualua's objections at the hearing on the Motion for Relief; and (5) granting Wilmington Savings's request for attorney's fees under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) chapter 507D. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve Kekaualua's points of error as follows: 
(1-4)  Kekaualua did not answer the Complaint, took no 
court action at any time with respect to the default that was entered against him, filed no response to the Motion for Relief, raised no evidentiary objection to the evidence brought forward by Wilmington Savings, and did not otherwise dispute the allegations of the Complaint or the evidence put forward by Wilmington Savings.  Even when the Circuit Court allowed him to address the court at the hearing on the Motion for Relief, 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Kekaualua did not deny any of the critical allegations that were 
raised in the Complaint and supported by Wilmington Savings in conjunction with the Motion for Relief.  It is essentially undisputed that, inter alia:  Wilmington Savings acquired title under a Commissioner's Deed in a prior foreclosure case; Kekaualua was a stranger to the borrowers and the subject property (Property), but nevertheless attempted to assert an 
interest in the Property, which was rejected in the foreclosure 
court and on appeal, but Kekaualua nevertheless moved into the Property and had to be evicted, and Kekaualua subsequently recorded a deed for the Property with the State of 
Hawaii Bureau 
of Conveyances, from himself to himself, and has taken other actions (e.g., seeking TROs against Wilmington Savings' realtor) that have significantly interfered with Wilmington Saving's property rights.  Kekaualua's oral explanation of a purported interest is loosely based on his assertion of a possibility that he has rights in the Property based on his genealogy and the assertion that there is no treaty of annexation here in Hawai i, 
which is in "military occupation," and in the rules of war, as a Kingdom of Hawai i national, he has rights to seek shelter and 
refuge, and he "took part in this" to provide a home and a place to grow food for his family. 
The evidentiary objections Kekaualua seeks to raise for 
the first time on appeal were not properly raised in the Circuit Court.  See MPM Hawaiian, Inc. v. Amigos, Inc., 63 Haw. 485, 486, 630 P.2d 1075, 1077 (1981); see also 
Hawaii Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28 (b)(4) & (7).  Under the circumstances 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of this case, the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in 
denying Kekaualua's request for two or three more months to research the Great Mahele to try to substantiate a claim to the Property.  Kekaualua's other procedural objections are both meritless and waived.  See HRAP Rule 28 (b)(4) & (7). 
(5)  Kekaualua argues, for the first time on appeal, 
that his "wild deed" is not a lien within the meaning of HRS chapter  507D (2018), and therefore, the Circuit Court erred in awarding Wilmington Savings attorney's fees pursuant to HRS § 507D-7.  This argument is waived.  See HRAP Rule 28 (b)(4) & (7).

For these reasons, the Circuit Court's April 1, 2021 
Judgment is affirmed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawaii, December 10, 2024.

2 We nevertheless note that this abusive recording appears to be the 
sort of action that the legislature sought to address in enacting HRS chapter 
507D.  See, e.g., State v. Lorenzo, CAAP-16-0000410, 2019 WL 7167171, at *4 
(Haw. App. Dec. 23, 2019) (SDO); Olson v. Lui, Civ. 10-00691 ACK, 2012 WL 39140, at *4-6 (D. Haw. Jan. 6, 2012) (Order).
