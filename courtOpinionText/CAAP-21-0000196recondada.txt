IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI#I 
IN THE INTEREST OF SK CHILDREN 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(FC-S NO. 18-00077) 
ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and McCullen, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of Appellant Mother's "Motion to 
Reconsider Order" (
Motion), filed on April 10, 2022, the papers 
in support and the record and files herein, it appears that: 
(1) a Summary Disposition Order was entered by this 
court on March 31, 2022; 
(2) Mother's Motion was filed on April 10, 2022; 
(3) Pursuant to Rules Expediting Child Protective 
Appeals (RECPA) Rule 14, "[a] motion for reconsideration may be filed no later than 5 days after the filing of the appellate court's opinion, summary disposition order, or dismissal order[,]" and thus Mother's Motion is untimely; and 
(4) Even if Mother's Motion had been timely filed, she 
does not establish that the court overlooked or misapprehended points of law or fact to support reconsideration of the Summary Disposition Order. See
 Rule 40 of the Hawai#i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure. NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is 
denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai#i, April 14, 2022.
