On appeal, Kozma's points of error2 primarily challenge 
the circuit court's granting of summary judgment in favor of 
1 The Honorable Jeffrey P. Crabtree presided.

A. "The trial court reversibly erred in the following [FOF] on 24 March 
2021 (11 RA 308), per Appendix 2, attached hereto and incorporatedherein by reference for the full text thereof"; 
B. "The trial court erred in making the following [COL] on 24 March
2021 per Appendix 2 attached, which is found in 11 RA No. 308 and

Plaintiff/Counterclaim Defendant-Appellee Deutsche Bank National 
Trust Company as Indenture Trustee for American Home Mortgage Investment Trust 2006-1, Mortgage-Backed Notes, Series 2006-1, also known as "Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, as 
Indenture Trustee for American Home Mortgage Investment Trust 
2006-1."  
As to the granting of summary judgment, Kozma contends 
the circuit court erred because (1) Deutsche Bank did not have standing, (2) the mortgage was not validly assigned, and (3) his 
(. . . continued) 
C. "The court order granting Plaintiff Deutsche Bank's motion for 
summary judgment on the complaint and for summary judgment on
Kozma's counterclaim is erroneous and found in 11 RA 308 filed 
24 March 2021, also in Appendix 2 incorporated herein by reference. 
Also[,] the court failed to appoint a commissioner, so this isvoid"; 
D. "The trial court erred in filing the judgment on 24 March 2021 in
Appendix 1, which is found in 11 RA 310"; and 
E. "The trial court erred [in] denying Kozma's 31 March 2021 stay 
motion." 
(Emphases omitted.) Regarding 
 Points  A and B, Kozma challenges various FOF 
and COL but provides  no specific analysis  to show the findings were clearly 
erroneous and the conclusions were wrong.   Hawai ‘i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP)  Rule 28(b)(7).   Thus, these points are waived.  
 
We construe Points C and D as challenging the granting of summary
judgment and address these  two  points in this summary disposition order.  
 
Regarding Point E, Kozma did not appeal from the circuit court's May 7, 
2021 order denying his motion to stay  and states: "[t]his [i]ssue to be 
argued in a separate stay motion in this Court on appeal. "  HRAP 
Rule  3(c)(2).  No motion for  stay has been  filed with this court. Thus, we 
do not reach  this issue.  
 
 Finally, we note that  the various subsections in  Kozma's arguments 
section  do not correspond with  his points of error.  Points not  raised in 
compliance with HRAP Rule 28(b)(4) are  deemed waived.

liability was discharged in bankruptcy court. We review an 
award of summary judgment de novo. Bank of New York Mellon as
Tr. for Certificate Holders of CWABS, Inc., Asset-Backed 
Certificates Series 2006-15 v. Larrua, 150 Hawaiʻ i 429, 438, 504 
P.3d 1017, 1026 (App. 2022). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve this 
appeal as discussed below, and affirm. 
(1) Kozma claims Deutsche Bank did not have standing 
to foreclose because it was not the trustee of "any existing trust suing in a representative capacity." 
The foreclosing party "must establish that it was the 
'person entitled to enforce [the note]' as defined by [Hawaiʻ i 
Revised Statutes ( 
HRS)] § 490:3-301 at the time of the filing of 
the foreclosure complaint." U.S. Bank N.A. v. Mattos, 140 
Hawaiʻi 26, 33, 398 P.3d 615, 622 (2017) (citing Bank of Am., 
N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawaiʻ i 361, 369-70, 390 P.3d 1248, 
1256-57 (2017)). Thus, "where . . . standing is based on 
possession of a Note indorsed in blank, the admissible evidence must also show that the blank indorsement occurred before the initiation of the suit." U.S. Bank Tr., N.A. as Tr. for LSF9
Master Participation Tr. v. Verhagen, 149 Hawaiʻ i 315, 328 n.11, 
489 P.3d 419, 432 n.11 (2021). A "[p]erson entitled to enforce 
4   
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
an instrument" is defined in relevant part as, "the holder of 
the instrument[.]" HRS § 490:3-301 (2008). When a note is indorsed in blank, it "becomes payable to bearer and may be negotiated by transfer or possession alone until specially 
indorsed." Reyes-Toledo
, 139 Hawaiʻi at 370, 390 P.3d at 1257; 
HRS § 490:3-205(b) (2008). "The burden to prove entitlement to 
enforce the note overlaps with the requirements of standing in 
foreclosure actions." Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Behrendt
, 142 
Hawaiʻi 37, 41, 414 P.3d 89, 93 (2018) (citations and internal 
quotation marks omitted). 
Here, Deutsche Bank established it had standing. 
Deutsche Bank produced a declaration from Ronaldo 
Reyes, Vice 
President of Deutsche Bank and custodian of records for the 
American Home Mortgage Investment Trust 2006-1 (the Trust) and its indenture trustee Deutsche Bank, while the underlying case was pending in circuit court. Reyes testified the Note and Mortgage originated before the complaint was filed, the Note was indorsed in blank, and the Note and Mortgage were "delivered and 
deposited with" Deutsche Bank on or before March 29, 2006 
pursuant to a Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement, which identified Deutsche Bank as the indenture trustee. Deutsche Bank submitted corresponding documents supporting Reyes's testimony. 
Deutsche Bank also provided a declaration from Derrick 
Raleigh, Senior Loan Analyst of Ocwen Financial Corporation, 
5   
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"whose indirect subsidiary" was the Trust's current loan 
servicer, PHH Mortgage Corporation (PHH). Raleigh testified that PHH received and incorporated into its records: (1) a copy of the original Note indorsed in blank; (2) a copy of the 
recorded Mortgage; and (3) a chain of Mortgage assignments from 
the original loan servicer to Deutsche Bank that occurred before the complaint was filed, indicating Deutsche Bank possessed the Note and Mortgage before the lawsuit was initiated. 
In sum, Deutsche Bank established it had standing to 
enforce the Note. HRS § 490:9-203(g) (2008) ("[t]he attachment of a security interest in a right to payment or performance secured by a security interest or other lien on personal or real 
property is also attachment of a security interest in the 
security interest, mortgage, or other lien"); see Reyes-Toledo
, 
139 Hawaiʻi at 371 n.17, 390 P.3d at 1258 n.17 (noting "the 
security follows the debt"). 
(2) Kozma also claims the mortgage was not validly 
assigned because American Home was in "Chapter 11" bankruptcy as of 2007. 
Kozma however did not present evidence indicating the 
Note and Mortgage were part of the bankruptcy estate. See Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Pasion
, 135 Hawai‘i 409, 353 P.3d 412, 
No. CAAP-12-00000657, 2015 WL 4067259, at *3 n.3, *4 (App. June 30, 2015) (SDO) (holding even if the court assumed the 
6   
 
  
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
bankruptcy involved the originating lender, nothing supported 
the arguments that the stay affected the originating lender or its nominee, or that the mortgagor's note and mortgage were included in the bankruptcy estate). 
(3) Finally, Kozma claims his 2016 personal 
bankruptcy discharged his liability on the Note and deprived Deutsche Bank of standing to foreclose. 
But Kozma's bankruptcy had no effect on Deutsche 
Bank's ability to foreclose. The bankruptcy order of discharge provided "a creditor with a lien may enforce a claim against the debtors' property subject to that lien unless the lien was avoided or eliminated[,]" and "[f]or example, a creditor may 
have the right to foreclose a home mortgage or repossess an 
automobile." 
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the circuit court's 
March 24, 2021 Judgment and Order.
