APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NOS. 1CC141001912 and 1CCV-20-0000123 (Consolidated)) 
MEMORANDUM OPINION 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and McCullen, JJ.) 
This case involves the disputed ownership of several 
streets in Kaka #ako (the Desky Streets ). After a bench trial, 
the Circuit Court of the First Circuit ruled that the Desky 
Streets are owned by the State of 1
Hawai#i. Kakaako Land Company, 
LLC (KLC) and its members Cedric Chun and Calvert J.T. Chun 
appeal from the February 16, 2022 First Amended Final Judgment 
for the State and the City and County of Honolulu. We affirm. 
I. BACKGROUND 
In 1896, Charles S. Desky  acquired 65 acres of land 
(the Property ) in what is now known as Kaka #ako. He subdivided 
the Property and laid out the Desky Streets. 
He recorded a map 
showing the subdivided lots and the Desky Streets on January 14, 1897. He sold the lots, which are not at issue here. 
In 1903, the territorial legislature passed a joint 
resolution about the Desky Streets. It stated: 
Whereas, Charles S. Desky is ready and willing to
convey to the Territory certain streets in Kewalo, Honolulu,
Island of Oahu, without cost or charge to the Territory; and 
Whereas, it would be a benefit to the public to have
such streets owned and controlled by the Government;Therefore 
Be it Resolved by the Legislature of the Territory of
Hawaii: 
1 The Honorable Jeffrey P. Crabtree presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
That the Superintendent of Public Works[2] be, and he
is hereby authorized and directed to accept from said
Charles S. Desky a deed conveying to the Territory (withoutcharge to the Government) all the title of said Charles S.Desky in and to the following named streets, situated inKewalo aforesaid, to wit: 
[naming the Desky Streets] 
Resolved , also, that after such conveyance said named
roads be maintained, repaired and cared for by the
Government as public highways. 
The record contains no deed from Desky to the Territory 
conveying title to the Desky Streets, but there is no dispute 
that Desky has not exercised ownership over the Desky Streets, maintained them, or paid real property tax on them, since 1903. 
Desky died in 1924, intestate. His granddaughter, 
Adele M. Christian , was his last known surviving heir. None of 
Desky's heirs exercised ownership over, maintained, or paid real property tax on, the Desky Streets until December 17, 1985, when Christian quitclaimed any interest she had in the Desky Streets to Calvert Chun for $5,000. Christian was retired from Dole/Castle & Cooke and living alone in a rented basement at the time. She died in 2000. 
On January 10, 1986, Calvert Chun quitclaimed the Desky 
Streets to Kakaako Land Company, Incorporated. The trial court found, and the parties don't contest, that Kakaako Land Company, Incorporated was converted to KLC. KLC didn't pay real property tax on the Desky Streets. KLC didn't exercise ownership of the Desky Streets until 2010, when it began charging people and businesses for parking. KLC put up signs and towed cars of those who didn't pay for parking. 
On September 11, 2014, several people and businesses 
sued KLC. They sought a declaration that KLC did not own the Desky Streets, and an injunction against KLC charging rent for parking on, and interfering with the use of, the Desky Streets. On January 27, 2020, KLC sued Desky's heirs and assigns, the

duties . . . of the minister of the interior which relate to streets and 
highways[.]" Hawai#i Organic Act § 75 (1900). 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
City, and the State to quiet title to the Desky Streets. The 
cases were consolidated on April 6, 2020. 
A jury-waived trial was held on September 28, 29, and 
30, and December 3, 2020. The trial court entered amended findings of fact and conclusions of law. A judgment was entered. KLC appealed. We remanded for entry of an appealable judgment under Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 602-57(3) and State v. 
Joshua, 141 Hawai #i 91, 93, 405 P.3d 527, 529 (2017). The First 
Amended Final Judgment was entered on February 16, 2022. It 
declared that the Desky Streets had been abandoned or surrendered to the Territory of 
Hawai#i in 1947 at the earliest, or at the 
latest by 1952, and enjoined KLC from exercising any acts of ownership or control over the Desky Streets. 
II. POINTS OF ERROR 
KLC contends that the trial court erred by finding and 
concluding that: (1) the Desky Streets were automatically 
abandoned or surrendered to the Territory of Hawai #i under The 
Highways Act, 1892, as amended; (2)
 Christian had no right, 
title, or interest in the Desky Streets when she executed the 1985 quitclaim deed, and conveyed no interest in the Desky Streets to Calvert Chun; and (3) the 1986 quitclaim deed from 
Calvert Chun to KLC's predecessor conveyed no property interest. 
III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
KLC does not challenge the trial court's findings of 
fact. See Hawai#i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(4)(C). 
"If a finding is not properly attacked, it is binding; and any conclusion which follows from it and is a correct statement of law is valid." Kawamata Farms, Inc. v. United Agri Prods. , 86 
Hawai#i 214, 252, 948 P.2d 1055, 1093 (1997). 
We review conclusions of law under the right/wrong 
standard. Est. of Klink ex rel. Klink v. State
, 113 Hawai#i 332, 
351, 152 P.3d 504, 523 (2007). When a conclusion presents mixed questions of fact and law, we review it under the clearly 
4  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
erroneous  standard because the trial court's conclusions depend 
on the facts and circumstances of each individual case. Id. A 
mixed finding and conclusion supported by the trial court's 
findings of fact and applying the correct rule of law will not be overturned. Id. 
We interpret statutes de novo. Barker v. Young , 153 
Hawai#i 144, 148, 528 P.3d 217, 221 (2023). We start with the 
statute's language; "implicit in the task of statutory construction is our foremost obligation to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the language contained in the statute itself." Id. "The rules of statutory interpretation require us 
to apply a plain language analysis when statutory language is clear. Only when there is an ambiguity in a statute are we to resort to other methods of statutory interpretation." Id. at 
149, 528 P.3d at 222. 
IV. DISCUSSION 
A. The trial court correctly concluded that the
Desky Streets were automatically surrenderedto the Territory of Hawai #i under Revised 
Laws of Hawaii § 6111 (1945) as amended. 
The disposition of this appeal turns on the application 
of The Highways Act, 1892, as amended. It was in effect when the 
Desky Streets were laid out. It originally provided, in relevant part: 
SECTION 1. This Act may be cited in all public
proceedings as "The Highways Act, 1892." 
DEFINITION OF PUBLIC HIGHWAY. 
SECTION 2. All roads, alleys, streets, ways, lanes,
courts, places, trails and bridges in the Hawaiian Islands,
whether now or hereafter opened, laid out or built by theGovernment, or by private parties, and dedicated orabandoned to the public as a highway, are hereby declared tobe public highways. 
All public highways once established shall continue
until abandoned by due process of law. 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
DEDICATION OF HIGHWAYS BY PRIVATE PERSONS. 
SECTION 3. Any road, alley, street, way, lane, court,
place, trail or bridge laid out, constructed, opened or
maintained by individuals or corporations as a highway, maybecome a public highway by dedication or abandonment, orsurrender thereof to general use by such individual orcorporation; provided that the same shall be accepted oradopted by the Minister of Interior. 
DEDICATION OR ABANDONMENT. 
S
ECTION 4. Dedication or abandonment of any highway,
mentioned in Section 2 of this Act, may be by deed or by asurrender or abandonment; such surrender or abandonmentshall be taken to be when no act of ownership by the ownerthereof has been exercised within five years. 
OWNERSHIP OF PUBLIC HIGHWAYS IN THE GOVERNMENT. 
S
ECTION 5. The ownership of all public highways and
the land, real estate and property of the same shall be inthe Hawaiian Government in fee simple. 
The Highways Act, 1892 was amended in 1913 by Act 107. 
By that time, the Territory had been divided into counties. 1913 
Haw. Sess. Laws Act 107: 
transferred the "general supervision, charge and control of
all public highways, roads, alleys, streets, ways, lanes,squares, courts, trails and bridges in the Territory . . .from the superintendent of public works of the Territory tothe several boards of supervisors or other governing bodiesof the several political subdivisions of the Territory[.]["] 
Wemple ex rel. Dang v. Dahman, 102 Hawai#i 27, 49, 72 P.3d 499, 
521 (App. 2002) (quoting 1913 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 107, § 1 at 
153), rev'd on other grounds, 103 Hawai #i 385, 83 P.3d 100 
(2004). Although the responsibility for maintaining public highways was transferred to the counties, title remained with the Territory. 102 Hawai #i at 47, 72 P.3d at 519 (citing Susan E. 
Jaworowski, Roads in Limbo: An Analysis of the State-County Jurisdictional Dispute 8, Legislative Reference Bureau Report No. 11 (1989)); see In re Am. Sugar Co., 29 Haw. 820, 825-26 (Haw. Terr. 1927) (noting "the County of Maui is charged with the burden of maintaining and repairing the highways within its borders" but "these considerations cannot operate to deprive the Territory of its title to the roadways"). 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
KLC argues that "upon passage of the 1913 amendments, 
the ability of the government to obtain ownership of private 
roads through surrender or abandonment was the exclusive domain of the counties." That is not correct. After 1913, private roads could be surrendered to either the Territory or a county; surrender to a county required formal acceptance, but surrender to the Territory did not. See Gold Coast Neighborhood Ass'n v. 
State
, 140 Hawai#i 437, 461, 403 P.3d 214, 238 (2017) (noting 
that by 1947, "the surrender statute had eliminated the requirement of the State's acceptance when such properties were 
surrendered to the state government , but retained the provision 
requiring formal acceptance with respect to surrender to the various counties" (emphasis added) (footnote omitted)). 
In 1947 the legislature created two categories of 
public highways: 
(1) territorial or federal-aid highways, which are all those
under the jurisdiction of the territorial highway engineeror the superintendent of public works pursuant to chapter 89or any other law; and (2) county highways, which are allother public highways. 
Id. (quoting 1947 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 142, § 1 at 251). The 
legislation also provided: 
All roads . . . in the Territory, opened, laid out, or built
by private parties and . . . surrendered to the public use,are declared to be public highways. . . . Such surrender 
shall be deemed to have taken place if no act of ownershipby the owner of any such road . . . has been exercised for
five years  and when, in the case of a county highway, in
addition thereto, the board of supervisors of the city and
county or county has, thereafter, by a resolution, adoptedthe same as a county highway. 
1947 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 142, § 1 at 252 (emphasis added). 
Act 142 amended Revised Laws of Hawaii ( RLH) § 6111 (1945) and 
took effect on May 17, 1947. 1947 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 142, § 2 at 252. 
The supreme court noted, in a case involving a 
privately built seawall that was regularly used by the public for beach access: 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawai#i appears to be "one of the few jurisdictions which
have provided, at one time or another, for vesting the fee
of a highway or road laid out by a private party andabandoned to the public in the central government." In re 
Kelley, 50 Haw. 567, 579, 445 P.2d 538, 546 (1968)
(discussing [The Highways Act, 1892]). . . . The fact that
ownership is automatically "deemed" surrendered to the State
after such a relatively brief [five-year] period  counsels in 
favor of an interpretation of the statute that is more
narrow than broad when considering a seawall not enumeratedwithin [HRS] § 264-1(c)(2) [(2007)]. 
Gold Coast , 140 Hawai #i at 463, 403 P.3d at 240 (emphasis added) 
(citations and footnote omitted). 
Here, KLC does not dispute that Desky and his heirs 
performed no act of ownership over the Desky Streets after 1903. 
Thus, the trial court was right when it concluded that "[t]he [Desky] Streets were automatically abandoned or surrendered to the Territory of Hawai #i in 1947 at the earliest, or 1952 [(five 
years after Act 142 (1947) took effect)] at the latest, pursuant to [T]he Highways Act, [1892,] as amended in 1947[.]" RLH § 6111 (1945, as amended); Gold Coast , 140 Hawai #i at 463, 403 P.3d at 
240. 
KLC argues that the Desky Streets could not have been 
surrendered to the Territory because they were not burdened by express easements in favor of the Territory, which KLC maintains is a prerequisite to surrender. 
KLC relies on Gold Coast, Levy 
v. Kimball, 50 Haw. 497, 443 P.2d 142 (1968), and Application of Banning, 73 Haw. 297, 832 P.2d 724 (1992). The issue in Gold Coast was whether the State had to maintain a privately built seawall. The supreme court noted that "seawall" was "not included in the categories of properties that may be surrendered to the State pursuant to HRS § 264-1(c)(2)" (2007), the successor statute to The Highways Act, 1892.  140 Hawai #i at 462, 403 P.3d 
3
3 HRS § 264-1 (2007) provided, in relevant part: 
(c) All roads, alleys, streets, ways, lanes, trails,
bikeways, and bridges  in the State, opened, laid out, or
built by private parties and . . . surrendered to the public
use, are declared to be public highways or public trails asfollows: 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
at 239. The court then held that "the State obtained an easement 
over and across the Seawall by implied dedication" and "thus has the right and the duty to maintain the surface of the Seawall over and across which it has an easement." 140 Hawai #i at 459-
60, 403 P.3d at 236-37 (cleaned up). Gold Coast  does not support 
the proposition that a road can only be surrendered to the State if it is burdened by an express easement in the State's favor. 
Levy was a personal injury case filed by a woman who 
tripped and fell off a seawall. The State had "an easement over this seawall for the express purpose of providing a path for public travel." 50 Haw. at 498, 443 P.2d at 144. The State argued that its easement was a "non-possessory interest . . . for a right to use the top of the seawall as a footpath by the general public" and its only duty was "to maintain the intangible interest in the surface of the seawall, but not the seawall itself which the [State] does not own, in a reasonably safe condition for those using it." Id. at 499, 443 P.2d at 144. In response, the supreme court stated that although seawalls were not mentioned in RLH § 142-1 (1955) (relating to highways, sidewalks, parks, and streets), "it can be fairly implied that a seawall such as that which is in question here which is used as a public thoroughfare is included in the term 'public highways'." Id. Then, citing to authority for the proposition that a 
municipality has a duty of care to keep public highways in a safe condition for travel, the supreme court held that the State "owed plaintiff a duty of care to maintain the seawall in a safe condition." Id. at 500, 443 P.2d at 145. The supreme court did 
. . . . 
(2) Surrender of public highways . . . shall be
deemed to have taken place if no act ofownership by the owner of the road, alley,street, bikeway, way, lane, trail, or bridge hasbeen exercised for five years and when, in thecase of a county highway, in addition thereto,the legislative body of the county has,thereafter, by a resolution, adopted the same asa county highway or trail. 
(Emphasis added.) 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
not hold that the seawall had been surrendered to the State, or 
that an express easement in favor of the State was a prerequisite to surrender. Surrender was not even an issue. 
KLC's statement that "Banning  held that the subject 
beach access trail at issue was not surrendered under HRS § 264-1 
since the State did not hold an express easement" is also wrong. 
That case involved a land court petition to register title to accreted beachfront land. The supreme court held that HRS § 264-1 (1985) did not apply because the petitioners "did not build or lay out a trail to the general public." 73 Haw. at 312, 832 P.2d at 732. 
KLC contends the trial court "ignored contradictory 
evidence of the conduct of the State[.]"
4 KLC seems to argue 
that the State should have been estopped from denying that KLC owns the Desky Streets because the Hawaii Community Development Authority ( HCDA) obtained orders of condemnation against Desky's 
heirs in 1992 and 1994; filed a condemnation proceeding against Desky's heirs, Calvert Chun, and Cedric Chun in 1995; and wrote a letter to Cedric Chun and obtained a right of entry from Kakaako Land Company, Inc. in 2010. The argument is not persuasive. "Once having acquired the fee [to a public highway], the Hawaiian Government and its successors, including the Territory and the State, could not be divested of title except by due process of law. This provision of [T]he Highways Act[, 1892] has continued in force until the present." In re Kelley , 50 Haw. 567, 580, 445 
P.2d 538, 547 (1968) (cleaned up); see  HRS § 264-3 (2020) (public 
highway to be disposed of "as provided by law"); 2024 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 109, §§ 1 & 2 at 278-80 (authorizing director of transportation to sell, convey, or otherwise dispose of state highways). KLC has not shown that HCDA had the authority to disclaim the State's fee ownership of the Desky Streets. "[E]stoppel will not be applied where the officials on whose 
4 The First Amended Final Judgment did not declare that the Desky
Streets were abandoned or surrendered to the City. We disregard KLC's
arguments about the City's conduct. 
10 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
conduct or acts it is sought to be predicated acted wholly beyond 
their power and authority[.]" State v. Zimring , 58 Haw. 106, 
127, 566 P.2d 725, 738 (1977). 
The State's amended cross-claim against the City 
alleged that the Desky Streets "are not now and never have been designated state highways by the director of transportation." KLC thus argues that the Desky Streets are not state highways because they are not in the state highway system, citing Santos v. Perreira, 2 Haw. App. 387, 633 P.2d 1118, (1981) and Maui Ranch Estates Owners Association v. Maui County, 6 Haw. App. 414, 724 P.2d 118 (1986). Maui Ranch involved a claim that a road in Makawao was a county highway. We held it was not because there was no evidence the Maui County Council had accepted the surrender or abandonment of the road as required by HRS § 264-1 (1985). Id. at 422, 724 P.2d at 124. Maui Ranch is inapposite because a surrender to the State doesn't require the State's acceptance. Gold Coast, 140 
Hawai#i at 461, 403 P.3d at 238. 
In 
Santos, the Santoses claimed to have a roadway 
easement over the Perreiras' property. They argued "that the unimproved dirt road was a surrendered public road pursuant to HRS § 264-1 (1976, as amended)." HRS § 264-1 (1976, as amended) provided, in relevant part: 
All roads, alleys, streets, ways, lanes, trails, bikeways,
and bridges in the State, opened, laid out, or built byprivate parties and . . . surrendered to the public use, aredeclared to be public highways. . . . Surrender of publichighways shall be deemed to have taken place if no act ofownership by the owner of the road, alley, street, bikeway,way, lane, trail, or bridge has been exercised for fiveyears and when, in the case of a county highway, in additionthereto, the legislative body of the county has, thereafter,by resolution, adopted the same as a county highway. 
We stated that the facts in the record did not support 
Santos's argument: 
A public highway is not a state highway unless it isdesignated for inclusion in the State Highway System underHRS § 264-41 (1976). . . . There is no evidence in therecord of the designation, acceptance, or adoption of thisroad by the state or the county. 
11 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2 Haw. App. at 390, 633 P.2d at 1122. Our statement was 
implicitly overruled in Gold Coast . There, the supreme held that 
"the surrender statute had eliminated the requirement of the State's acceptance when such properties were surrendered to the state government[.]" 140 Hawai #i at 461, 403 P.3d at 238. 
Ownership of a privately laid-out road "is automatically  'deemed' 
surrendered to the State after . . . a relatively brief [five-
year] period" under HRS § 264-1(c)(2) (2007).
5 140 Hawai #i at 
463, 403 P.3d at 240 (emphasis added). 
That was so whether or 
not the director of transportation accepts it or designates it as a state highway. 
In addition, the plain language of the designation 
provisions in HRS § 264-41 and HRS § 264-42 was contrary to our statement in Santos . 
HRS § 264-41 (1976) provided: 
There is established a state highway system which shall
consist of federal-aid highways and other public highways
which may be designated for inclusion in the system pursuant
to section 264-42. 
(Emphasis added.) HRS § 264-42 (1976) in turn provided: 
The director of transportation acting in cooperation withappropriate federal and county agencies, may designate for
inclusion in the state highway system, such other public
highways, including county highways , which are used
primarily for through traffic and not for access to anyspecific property, whether residential, business, or otherabutting property. 
(Emphasis added). Read together, those statutes authorized — but 
did not require — the director of transportation to include non-state highways in the state highway system by designation. They did not require that the director specifically designate state highways — such as those surrendered to the state under former HRS § 264-1(c)(2) — for inclusion in the state highway system before they could be considered state highways. 
5 HRS § 264-1(c)(2) was amended in 2016 to replace the five-year
automatic surrender provision with a procedure for condemnation. 2016 Haw.

B. The trial court correctly concluded that the
1985 quitclaim deed from Christian conveyedno interest in the Desky Streets to CalvertChun. 
The Desky Streets were surrendered to the Territory 
before 1985. Christian had no legal interest in the Desky 
Streets when she quitclaimed them to Calvert Chun. Her quitclaim deed was a legal nullity. 
C. The trial court correctly concluded that the
1986 quitclaim deed from Calvert Chun toKLC's predecessor conveyed no interest in theDesky Streets. 
Calvert Chun had no legal interest in the Desky Streets 
when he quitclaimed them to KLC's predecessor. His quitclaim 
deed was a legal nullity.
