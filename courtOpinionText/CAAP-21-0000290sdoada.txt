APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 3CCV-20-0000266) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and Nakasone, JJ.) 
Honoka#a Land Company, LLC appeals from the March 22, 
2021 Final Judgment re: Specific Performance  for Boteilho Hawaii 
Enterprises, Inc. and Edward Boteilho , Jr.; and the July 21, 2021 
Final Judgment  for Boteilho Hawaii, Boteilho, Dutch-Hawaiian NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Farms LLC, Mauna Kea  Moo, LLC, Kees Kea, Cornel Kea, and Malena 
Kea, both entered by the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit.1 We 
vacate the March 22, 2021 and July 21, 2021 judgments and remand 
to the Circuit Court for entry of an order dismissing Count I of Honoka#a Land's complaint as moot, and for further proceedings on 
Count II consistent with this summary disposition order. 
This case involves the Clover Leaf Dairy. It was 
operated by Boteilho Hawaii on land under Lease from the State of 
Hawai#i. In January 2017 Boteilho Hawaii and Honoka #a Land signed 
a Contract  for Honoka#a 
 Land to purchase the Dairy for 
$2 million. In January 2020 Boteilho Hawaii agreed to sell the Dairy to Kees Kea for $700,000. On July 9, 2020, Honoka #a Land 
sued Boteilho Hawaii for breach of contract (Count I), and Boteilho, Dutch-Hawaiian, Mauna Kea, and the Keas for tortious interference with contractual relations ( TICR) (Count II). 
Honoka#a Land sought specific performance of the Contract, 
damages, costs, and attorney fees. 
Boteilho Hawaii and Boteilho moved for partial summary 
judgment on Honoka #a
 Land's specific performance claim, which was 
part of Count I ( MPSJ). The Circuit Court granted the MPSJ and 
purported to enter a Hawai #i Rules of Civil Procedure ( HRCP) 
Rule 54(b)-certified judgment. Honoka#a
 Land's appeal created 
Judiciary Information Management System ( JIMS) No. CAAP-21-
0000290. 
Dutch-Hawaiian and Mauna Kea then moved for summary 
judgment ( MSJ). 
Boteilho Hawaii and Boteilho joined in the MSJ. 
The Circuit Court granted the MSJ and awarded attorney fees to Boteilho Hawaii, Boteilho, Dutch-Hawaiian, and Mauna Kea. The Final Judgment was entered on July 21, 2021. Honoka#a Land's 
appeal created JIMS No. CAAP-21-0000470. 
We consolidated the 
appeals. 
Honoka#a Land contends that the Circuit Court erred by: 
(1) granting the MPSJ; (2) certifying its order granting the MPSJ 
1 The Honorable Robert D.S. Kim presided. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
under HRCP Rule 54(b); (3) granting the MSJ; and (4) awarding 
attorney fees. 
On November 21, 2022 (after briefing was completed), 
Boteilho Hawaii filed a petition for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In 
re Boteilho Haw. Enters., Inc. , No. 22-00827 (Bankr. D. Haw. 
2022). Boteilho Hawaii's reorganization plan was approved, it received a discharge, and the bankruptcy case was closed on March 31, 2025. We ordered supplemental briefing about the effect Boteilho Hawaii's discharge had on the issues presented by these appeals. Honoka#a Land and Dutch-Hawaiian and Mauna Kea 
filed supplemental briefs. 
Boteilho Hawaii and Boteilho joined 
in Dutch-Hawaiian and Mauna Kea's supplemental brief.
 Honoka #a Land's breach-of-contract claim against 
Boteilho Hawaii (Count I) was rendered moot by Boteilho Hawaii's discharge in bankruptcy. We address whether the Circuit Court erred by granting summary judgment for Boteilho, Dutch-Hawaiian, Mauna Kea, and the Keas on Honoka #a Land's TICR claim, and by 
awarding attorney fees and costs to Boteilho Hawaii, Boteilho, Dutch-Hawaiian, and Mauna Kea. 
Summary Judgment.  We review a grant of summary 
judgment de novo. Ralston v. Yim
, 129 Hawai#i 46, 55, 292 P.3d 
1276, 1285 (2013). Summary judgment is appropriate if the evidence shows there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. 
Id. A fact is material if proof of that fact would establish or 
refute one of the essential elements of a party's cause of action or defense. 
Id. at 55-56, 292 P.3d at 1285-86. The evidence 
must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party — Honoka #a Land. Id. at 56, 292 P.3d at 1286. 
To prove Boteilho, Dutch-Hawaiian, Mauna Kea, and the 
Keas tortiously interfered with the Contract, Honoka#a Land had 
the burden to show: (1) the Contract between Honoka #a Land and 
Boteilho Hawaii; (2) the defendants' knowledge of the Contract;
(3) the defendants' intentional inducement of Boteilho Hawaii to 
breach the Contract; (4) absence of justification on the 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
defendants' part; (5) the subsequent breach of the Contract by 
Boteilho Hawaii; and (6) damages to Honoka #a Land. See Weinberg 
v. Mauch
, 78 Hawai #i 40, 50, 890 P.2d 277, 287 (1995). 
When (as here) the summary judgment movants do not have 
the burden of proof, they have the burden to show (1) Honoka #a 
Land cannot prove the essential elements of its claim for TICR; 
and (2) the uncontroverted facts entitle them to judgment as a matter of law. Ralston
, 129 Hawai #i at 56, 292 P.3d at 1286. 
They can satisfy their burden by either (1) presenting evidence negating an element of 
Honoka#a Land's claim, or (2) showing that 
Honoka#a Land cannot satisfy its burden of proof at trial. Id. 
at 60, 292 P.3d at 1290. 
We initially note that Kees Kea, Cornel Kea, and Malena 
Kea neither moved for summary judgment nor joined in Dutch-Hawaiian and Mauna Kea's motion for summary judgment. The Circuit Court thus erred by entering the Final Judgment for the Keas. 
Dutch-Hawaiian and Mauna Kea argued it was the law of 
the case that there was no enforceable contract between Honokaa# 
Land and Boteilho Enterprises to purchase the Dairy. They relied on the order granting Boteilho Enterprises' MPSJ. The MPSJ argued Honoka #a Land wasn't entitled to specific performance 
because it couldn't show it was ready, willing, and able to perform under the Contract. It did not argue there was no contract — it actually attached a copy of the Contract to its motion — or that the Contract was unenforceable or had been terminated. 
Honoka#a Land opposed the MPSJ with a declaration from 
the president of its sole member. 
He stated that Honoka #a Land 
was ready, willing, and able to tender the purchase price under the Contract. He also stated that Honoka #a Land was ready, 
willing, and able to apply for State approval of an assignment of the Lease. Boteilho's declaration supporting the MPSJ stated that the State Board of Land and Natural Resources had consented to assignment of the Lease "subject to Honoka #a Land providing 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
financing for the purchase." Thus, there was a genuine issue of 
material fact about whether Honoka #a Land was ready, willing, and 
able to perform under the Contract. The Circuit Court erred by granting the MPSJ. As a matter of law, the order granting the 
MPSJ should not have formed the law of the case. 
Honoka#a Land submitted a declaration opposing the MSJ 
that authenticated the Contract and showed 
Honoka#a Land's part 
performance of the Contract (deposit of $55,000 into escrow). Viewed in the light most favorable to Honoka#a 
Land, the Contract 
was a valid contract. See Ralston, 129 Hawai #i at 56, 292 P.3d 
at 1286. 
The MSJ also argued: Dutch-Hawaiian and Mauna Kea 
couldn't know the terms of the Contract because there was no actual contract; they couldn't induce the breach of the Contract because there was no actual contract; their contracting with Boteilho Enterprises to acquire the Dairy was justified because there was no contract between Honoka #a Land and Boteilho to sell 
the Dairy; Boteilho did not breach the Contract; and 
Honoka#a 
Land cannot prove it was damaged because it cannot prove the existence of the Contract or the sale price. The only evidence offered to support these arguments was the transcript of the hearing on the MPSJ (apparently to establish the law of the case) and Honoka #a Land's June 10, 2019 letter notifying Boteilho 
Hawaii it breached the Contract. Dutch-Hawaiian and Mauna Kea failed to sustain their burden as MSJ movant to show there was no contract to sell the Dairy to Honoka #a Land, that they didn't 
induce Boteilho Hawaii to breach the Contract, that Honoka #a Land 
had no damages, or that Honoka #a Land couldn't sustain its burden 
to prove TICR. The Circuit Court erred by granting the MSJ.
Attorney Fees.  We vacate the award of attorney fees to 
Boteilho Hawaii, Boteilho, Dutch-Hawaiian, and Mauna Kea because we are vacating the March 22, 2021 and July 21, 2021 judgments. Ass'n of Owners of Kalele Kai v. Yoshikawa, 149 
Hawai#i 417, 420, 
493 P.3d 939, 942 (2021) (stating that "an award of attorneys' fees is inappropriate where the underlying judgment is vacated"). 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Circuit Court's March 22, 2021 Final Judgment re: 
Specific Performance  and July 21, 2021 Final Judgment  are 
vacated. This case is remanded to the Circuit Court for entry of 
an order dismissing Count I of Honoka #a Land's complaint as moot 
and further proceedings on Count II consistent with this summary disposition order.
