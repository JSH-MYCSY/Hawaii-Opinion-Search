On appeal, Cummings contends: 
No Evidence of Jurisdiction "Burden of Proof" falls on the 
STATE OF HAWAII for Superior Title to argue entering ofClosed Areas on said location that the STATE does not have jurisdiction over. ROSLYN NICOLE MANAWAIAKEA CUMMINGS with Memorandum Declaration of Hawaiian National stating inherentvested rights to the Kingdom of Hawai# i; Grandfather clause. 
We construe Cummings' contentions as challenging jurisdiction and 
the sufficiency of the evidence. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve Cummings' contentions as follows, and affirm. 
(1) Regarding Cummings' jurisdictional challenge, 
"[p]ursuant to HRS § 701-106 (1993), the [S]tate's criminal jurisdiction encompasses all areas within the territorial boundaries of the State of Hawai
#i." State v. Kaulia, 128 Hawai #i 
479, 487, 291 P.3d 377, 385 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting State v. Jim, 105 Hawai
#i 319, 330, 97 P.3d 
395, 406 (App. 2004)). The Hawai #i Supreme Court has reaffirmed 
that "whatever may be said regarding the lawfulness of its origins, the State of Hawai
#i is now, a lawful government. 
Individuals claiming to be citizens of the Kingdom and not of the State are not exempt from application of the State's laws." Id.

(b) Vehicles left unattended in closed areas may be
impounded by the board or its authorized representative at
any time. 
(c) All impounded vehicles shall be towed to a place
of storage. Towing, storage and other related 13—146—7 costsshall be assessed pursuant to section 290-11, HRS. 
3 Violation of HAR § 13-146-4 is a petty misdemeanor. Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS) 184-5(b) (2011).

(cleaned up) (quoting State v. Fergerstrom, 106 Hawai #i 43, 55, 
101 P.3d 652, 664 (App. 2004), aff'd, 106 Hawai #i 41, 101 P.3d 
225 (2004)). 
(2) Regarding the sufficiency of evidence argument, 
Cummings failed to provide this court with transcripts of the 
proceedings. "If the appellant intends to urge on appeal that a finding or conclusion is unsupported by the evidence or is contrary to the evidence, the appellant shall include in the record a transcript of all evidence relevant to such finding or conclusion." 
Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 10(b)(3). 
Without the relevant transcript, this court has no basis to review a claim of insufficient evidence. State v. Hoang, 93 Hawai
#i 333, 334-36, 3 P.3d 499, 500-02 (2000). 
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the district court's 
March 25, 2021 Judgment/Order and Notice of Entry of Judgment/Order.
