On appeal, Cummings contends:  
No Evidence of Jurisdiction "Burden of Proof" falls on the 
STATE OF HAWAII for Superior Title to argue trespassing onsaid location that the STATE does not have jurisdictionover.  ROSLYN NICOLE MANAWAIAKEA CUMMINGS with Affidavit of Heirship to vested rights to claimant B. NAUMU(January 19th, 1848) Land Commission Award # 5362, RoyalPatent # 8137; Grandfather Clause. 
We construe Cummings' contentions as challenging jurisdiction and 
sufficiency of the evidence. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve Cummings' contentions as follows, and affirm. 
(1) Regarding Cummings' jurisdictional challenge, 
"[p]ursuant to HRS § 701-106 (1993), the [S]tate's criminal jurisdiction encompasses all areas within the territorial boundaries of the State of Hawai# i."  State v. Kaulia, 128 
Hawai# i 
479, 487, 291 P.3d 377, 385 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting State v. Jim, 105 Hawai# i 319, 330, 97 P.3d 
395, 406 (App. 2004)).  The Hawai# i Supreme Court has reaffirmed 
that "whatever may be said regarding the lawfulness of its origins, the State of Hawai# i is now, a lawful government. 
Individuals claiming to be citizens of the Kingdom and not of the State are not exempt from application of the State's laws."  Id. (cleaned up) (quoting State v. Fergerstrom, 106 Hawai# i 43, 55, 
101 P.3d 652, 664 (App. 2004), aff'd, 106 Hawai# i 41, 101 P.3d 
225 (2004)). 
(2) Regarding her sufficiency of evidence argument, 
Cummings failed to provide this court with transcripts of the proceedings.  "If the appellant intends to urge on appeal that afinding or conclusion is unsupported by the evidence or is  
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
contrary to the evidence, the appellant shall include in the 
record a transcript of all evidence relevant to such finding or conclusion."  
Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 10(b)(3).
Without the relevant transcript, this court has no basis to review a claim of insufficient evidence.  State v. Hoang, 93 Hawai# i 333, 335-36, 3 P.3d 499, 501-02 (2000).  
Based on the forgoing, we affirm the district court's 
April 8, 2021 Judgment and Notice of Entry of Judgment. 
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, June 24, 2022.
