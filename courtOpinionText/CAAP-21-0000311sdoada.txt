OF THE STATE OF HAWAI#I 
IN THE MATTER OF THE 
ELAINE EMMA SHORT REVOCABLE LIVING TRUST 
AGREEMENT, Dated July 17, 1984, as amended 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1TR151000165) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and McCullen, JJ.) 
This is an appeal from a contested matter in a trust 
proceeding. 
Kristin Linae Cook Kline, Larry Thomas Cook, Cathy 
Leann Cook Bornhorst, Susan Kay Cook Galvin, and Jodi Charlene 
Cook Bosben (collectively, the Cooks) appeal from the April 6, 
2021 "Judgment  on the Order Granting Petition for Instructions 
Regarding Principal Distributions and Attorneys' Fees, and for Modification of Trust" entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit, sitting in probate.
1 We vacate the Judgment; affirm in 
part and vacate in part the March 5, 2021 "Order Granting Petition for Instructions Regarding Principal Distributions and Attorneys' Fees, and for Modification of Trust"; and remand for proceedings consistent with this summary disposition order. 
1 The Honorable R. Mark Browning presided.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
This case is before us a second time. The facts and 
procedural history are recited in In re Elaine Emma Short 
Revocable Living Tr. Agreement Dated July 17, 1984 , No. CAAP-15-
0000960, 2019 WL 2417367 (Haw. App. June 10, 2019) ( Short I) 
(mem. op.), vacated , 147 Hawaii# 456, 465 P.3d 903 (2020), and 
In 
re Elaine Emma Short Revocable Living Tr. Agreement Dated July 17, 1984
, 147 Hawai#i 456, 465 P.3d 903 (2020) ( Short II ). 
Relevant to this appeal, trustee First Hawaiian Bank ( FHB
) filed 
a petition to modify Elaine Emma Short's Trust. Elaine's son 
David Short, the Trust's only surviving primary beneficiary, 
supported the petition. The Cooks, claiming to be contingent 
remainder beneficiaries, contested the petition. The probate court granted the petition.
2 The Cooks appealed. We affirmed in 
part and reversed in part. The Cooks applied for certiorari. The supreme court accepted the application. 
The probate court had not entered findings of fact. 
The supreme court stated that without findings of fact, it was "not able to meaningfully review the probate court's Order" granting FHB's petition. 
Short II, 147 Hawai#i at 467, 465 P.3d 
at 914. The supreme court noted the probate court didn't issue an order retaining the case (required by Hawai #i Probate Rules 
(HPR) Rule 20), depriving the parties of "an opportunity under 
HPR Rule 20(d) to request that the probate court adopt [Hawai #i 
Rules of Civil Procedure ( HRCP)] Rule 52 and render findings of 
fact[.]" 
Id. at 469, 465 P.3d at 916. 
The supreme court also 
noted the judge who presided over FHB's petition was not 
available on remand, and a successor judge could not enter findings of fact in a case tried before a predecessor judge. Id. 
at 471 n.30, 465 P.3d at 918 n.30 (citing Hana Ranch, Inc. v. Kanakaole , 66 Haw. 643, 649-50, 672 P.2d 550, 554 (1983)). The 
supreme court remanded the contested matter to the probate court "for further proceedings consistent with [its] opinion." Id. 
2 The Honorable Derrick H.M. Chan presided. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
FHB filed a renewed Petition  with the probate court on 
September 29, 2020. The court set a hearing on the Petition for 
December 17, 2020. The Cooks objected to the Petition on October 29, 2020. This created a contested matter. See HPR 
Rule 19. The probate court heard the Petition on December 17, 2020, without entering an HPR Rule 20 order retaining the case. A minute order retaining the contested matter, granting the Petition, and denying the Cooks' request for payment of their attorneys' fees from the Trust was entered on January 4, 2021. Findings of fact and conclusions of law were entered on March 5, 2021. The "Order Granting Petition for Instructions Regarding Principal Distributions and Attorneys' Fees, and for Modification of Trust" was also entered on March 5, 2021. The Judgment was entered on April 6, 2021. This appeal followed. 
The statement of the points of error in the Cooks' 
opening brief fails to comply with Hawai #i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure ( HRAP
) Rule 28(b)(4). The Cooks contend the probate 
court erred by modifying the Trust, making findings of disputed fact without conducting an evidentiary hearing, and denying payment of their attorneys fees from Trust principal. Their points fail to include "a quotation of the finding or conclusion urged as error or reference to appended findings" as required by HRAP Rule 28(b)(4)(C). Ordinarily, "unchallenged factual findings are deemed to be binding on appeal[.]" Okada Trucking 
Co. v. Bd. of Water Supply , 97 Hawai #i 450, 459, 40 P.3d 73, 82 
(2002). 
For the reasons explained below, however, we need not 
address the probate court's findings of fact to decide this appeal. 
(1) The Cooks argue the probate court found certain 
declarants to be "credible and persuasive" and others "not credible or persuasive" without holding "an evidentiary hearing to fairly resolve these disputed issues of material fact[.]" Ordinarily, "an appellate court will not pass upon issues dependent upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight of evidence; this is the province of the trier of fact." Fisher v. 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Fisher, 111 Hawai#i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 (2006) (citation 
omitted). We need not address the credibility determinations 
because the probate court didn't follow the mandate of 
Short II . 
The probate court retained the contested matter but did 
not enter a written HPR Rule 20(a) order until after the December 17, 2020 hearing, when it granted FHB's Petition. In the last appeal the supreme court stated: 
the probate court in this case did not comply with the
probate rules when it failed to issue an order retaining thecase and, because there was no order of assignment, failedto specifically afford the parties the ability to requestthat the Hawai #i Rules of Civil Procedure and/or the Rules
of the Circuit Courts be applicable in the contested matter. 
Short II, 147 Hawai#i at 471 n.28, 465 P.3d at 918 n.28; see 
also
, In re Est. of Campbell , 106 Hawai#i 453, 460 n.16, 106 P.3d 
1096, 1103 n.16 (2005) (discussing that once an HPR Rule 20(a) 
order is entered, "the court then has the opportunity to decide 
what procedures will be used if the contested matter is retained" (emphasis added)). Those rules include not only HRCP Rule 52 (findings by the court) mentioned by the supreme court, 
Short II , 
147 Hawai#i at 468, 465 P.3d at 915, but also Rules 39(b) (trial 
by the court) and 56 (summary judgment). This structural error was a departure from the supreme court's mandate, and requires another remand of the contested matter. 
(2) When this case was first before us, David cross-
appealed from the probate court's order allowing the Cooks' attorneys' fees and costs to be paid from Trust principal. 
We 
held the probate court abused its discretion by granting the Cooks' request for attorneys' fees and costs to be paid from Trust principal. Short I, 2019 WL 2417367, at *11. On certiorari, the Cooks argued that we gravely erred. Short II , 
147 
Hawai#i at 464, 465 P.3d at 911. The supreme court did not 
address the fee issue, but it vacated our judgment on appeal except for one issue unrelated to the appeal now before us. The supreme court also vacated the probate court's judgment and order, including the grant of the Cooks' request for attorneys' 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
fees and costs to be paid from Trust principal. Id. at 475, 465 
P.3d at 922. We conclude there is no law of the case on this issue, which arises independent of the probate court's failure to enter an HPR Rule 20(a) order. 
We review the probate court's denial of the Cooks' fee 
request for abuse of discretion. In re Tr. Agreement Dated June 6, 1974, 145 Hawai #i
 300, 309, 452 P.3d 297, 306 (2019). 
Conclusions of law are reviewed de novo. Fisher, 111 Hawai #i
 at 
46, 137 P.3d at 360. The probate court concluded: 
22. The Hawai #i Supreme Court has held that
attorneys' fees and costs for a contingent beneficiary are
not properly payable from the trust estate. See Von Holt v. 
Williams , 23 Haw. 245 (1916) ("It is well established that
fees of counsel for a litigant whose interest is contingentcannot be allowed out of the trust fund[.]"). Contingentremainder beneficiaries are members of a class living at aparticular time that cannot be ascertained until theoccurrence of a future event. See, e.g. , Carter v. Davis ,
18 Haw. 439, 444-45 (1907). 
23. In Von Holt, the testator's granddaughter was
the residuary beneficiary of the estate and a contingentbeneficiary of the income of the estate. Even though shewas a residuary beneficiary of the Trust, the 
Hawai#i 
Supreme Court denied the payment of her attorneys' fees fromthe principal of the trust. 23 Haw. 245. 
Here, the [Cooks]
have a lesser interest than that discussed in Van Holt; theyhave merely a contingent interest in the Trust. See Short ,
147 Hawai #i at 472, 465 P.3d at 919. Under the terms of 
this Trust, the remainder beneficiaries are unascertaineduntil the termination of the Trust, or David's death. The [Cooks] will have an interest in the Trust only if all ofthe following conditions are met: (1) David does not haveany issue, either adopted or legitimate, at his death,(2) the purported contingent remainder beneficiary is aliveat David's death, and (3) the individual is determined bythe laws of the State of Hawai #i in force at David's death,
to be one of [Elaine]'s heirs at law. Following Van Holt ,
the payment of attorneys' fees and costs for the [Cooks]relating to the 2015 Petition, the appeal of the 2015Petition, and this Petition, are not properly payable fromthe Trust. 
24. In addition, a beneficiary may be awarded
attorneys' fees and costs from a trust or estate only wherethe beneficiaries' participation in the case advances theinterest of all beneficiaries. See In re Campbell's Estate ,
46 Haw. 475, 522, 382 P.2d 920, 953 (1963); Bishop Trust Co.v. Cooke Trust Co., 39 Haw. 641, 651 (1953); Von Holt v. Williamson, 23 Haw. 245, 248 (1916). In the instant case,this Court concludes that the [Cooks'] position was self-serving and clearly did not benefit the interests of all
beneficiaries. Accordingly, the [Cooks'] request for
attorneys' fees and costs is denied. 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"It is well established that fees of counsel for a 
litigant whose interest is contingent cannot be allowed out of 
the trust fund[.]" Von Holt v. Williamson, 23 Haw. 245, 248-49 (Haw. Terr. 1916). The Cooks are at most contingent remainder beneficiaries of Elaine's Trust. Article V.B.(b) of Elaine's trust agreement, as amended on March 10, 1993, provides in relevant part: 
if neither of [Elaine]'s said sons is living [when Elaine
dies], all of the aforesaid trust property shall bedistributed to [Elaine]'s heirs at law, determined by thelaws of the State of Hawaii in force at such time. 
Article V of the trust agreement provides: 
C. Upon [Elaine]'s death, if neither [Elaine]'s
spouse CLARENCE RAYMOND SHORT nor any of [Elaine]'sdescendants survive [Elaine], then at such time [FHB] shalldispose of all of the then remaining residuary trust estateunder Article VIII hereinbelow. 
Article VIII provides: 
If, at any time, the foregoing provisions do not
provide persons qualified to take the trust estate, then thetrust estate shall be distributed to those persons who wouldconstitute the heirs-at-law of [Elaine] as then determinedunder, and in the proportions then provided by, the laws ofthe state of [Elaine]'s domicile at the date of [Elaine]'sdeath relating to descent and distribution of property, thesame in all respects as though [Elaine]'s death had occurredat the time that such assets became subject to distribution
under this Article. 
The Cooks are not named as beneficiaries in the Trust 
or the amendment. As contingent beneficiaries at most, their 
attorneys fees "cannot be allowed out of the trust fund[.]" Von Holt, 23 Haw. at 248-49. 
The Cooks cite Bishop Trust Co. v. Jacobs, 36 Haw. 686 
(Haw. Terr. 1944) (Jacobs II). Jacobs II was an appeal from an award of attorneys fees to parties involved in a dispute over distribution of trust income reported in Bishop Trust Co. v. Jacobs, 36 Haw. 314 (Haw. Terr. 1942) (Jacobs I). The litigants in Jacobs I were the income beneficiary (the settlor's daughter) 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and three of the named remainder beneficiaries (the settlor's 
daughter being the fourth remainder beneficiary with a 5/8 share). The remainder beneficiaries lost Jacobs I , but were 
awarded their attorney's fees. The fee award was affirmed in Jacobs II . The remainder beneficiaries there were vested, not 
contingent, so Von Holt  did not apply. 
The Cooks also cite Valentin v. Brunette, 26 Haw. 498 
(Haw. Terr. 1922). The facts underlying that case were reported in Valentin v. Brunette , 26 Haw. 417 (Haw. Terr. 1922). There, 
the income and remainder beneficiaries of a trust disputed whether certain expenses were to be paid from trust income or principal. All parties' attorneys were awarded their fees. The remainder beneficiaries in that case (the descendants of John Ena's children) were vested, not contingent. Again, Von Holt  did 
not apply. 
An exception to the general rule that a party must bear 
their own attorneys fees is when the party advances "the interests of all the beneficiaries of a trust[.]" In re Estate 
of Campbell , 46 Haw. 475, 522, 382 P.2d 920, 953 (1963) (emphasis 
added). For example, if a "beneficiary successfully maintains an action to recover or preserve the trust property for the benefit of all the beneficiaries[,] . . . costs and expenses may be allowed such beneficiary out of the principal of the trust fund[.]" Von Holt, 23 Haw. at 248. Here, the Cooks tried to advance their own interests, which were opposed to those of David, the primary trust beneficiary. "[T]he litigation must be in advancement of, and not in opposition to , the interest of all 
the beneficiaries  or no allowance of counsels' fees out of the 
trust fund will be made." Id. (emphasis added). 
The probate court applied the correct Hawai #i law. It 
did not abuse its discretion by following the law and denying attorneys fees to the Cooks. 
For these reasons, the April 6, 2021 "Judgment on the 
Order Granting Petition for Instructions Regarding Principal Distributions and Attorneys' Fees, and for Modification of Trust" 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
is vacated; the March 5, 2021 "Order Granting Petition for 
Instructions Regarding Principal Distributions and Attorneys' Fees, and for Modification of Trust" is affirmed only as to the denial of the Cooks' request for attorneys fees, and is otherwise vacated; and this case is remanded to the probate court for proceedings consistent with this summary disposition order. On remand, the probate court may assign the contested matter to the circuit court civil trials calendar under HPR Rule 20(b) if the probate court considers it appropriate.
