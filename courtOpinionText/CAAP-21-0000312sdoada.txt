Ah Mow raises two points of error, contending that the 
District Court abused its discretion: (1) in accepting into evidence the results of the Stalker XLR LIDAR speed gun (the

LIDAR) because there was insufficient foundation showing that 
Honolulu Police Department (HPD) Sergeant Jesse Takushi (Sergeant Takushi) received training that met the LIDAR manufacturer's requirements; and (2) in finding there was sufficient foundation 
for HPD Officer Art Gazelle's (Officer Gazelle's) testimony 
regarding Ah Mow's performance on the standardized field sobriety 
test (SFST). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve Ah Mow's points of error as follows: 
(1) Ah Mow argues that the District Court abused its 
discretion in admitting the results of the LIDAR reading because there was insufficient foundation to show that Sergeant Takushi's training met the manufacturer's requirements, as required by State v. Assaye, 121 Hawai# i 204, 210, 216 P.3d 1227, 1233 
(2009). 
The Hawai# i Supreme Court has held: 
In order to establish a sufficient foundation for the 
admission of a speed reading from a laser gun, the
prosecution is required to produce evidence that the "natureand extent of an officer's training in the operation of thelaser gun meets the requirements indicated by themanufacturer." [Assaye, 121 Hawai #i at 215, 216 P.3d at
1238]. "[T]o meet this burden the prosecution mustestablish both (1) the requirements indicated by themanufacturer, and (2) the training actually received by theoperator of the laser gun."

Hawai #i [314,] 327, 288 P.3d [788,] 801 [(2012)]. 
State v. Amiral , 132 Hawai#i 170, 178, 319 P.3d 1178, 1186 
(2014).

Here, Sergeant Takushi testified that in conjunction 
with his training he received and reviewed an operator's manual 
issued by Applied Concepts/Stalker, the manufacturer of the LIDAR device, which had the LIDAR on the front cover, and the manufacturer's copyright on the back. He testified as to the specifics of his training and the manufacturer's recommendations. Sergeant Takushi testified to taking two training courses, in March of 2018 and January of 2019, one conducted by HPD Officer Ryan Espiritu, who had received instructor training and certification by Stalker, and one conducted by Steven Hocker, a representative from Stalker. The training included in-class and practical training, going over the manual, hands-on training and practice with the LIDAR, and written and practical tests. Sergeant Takushi testifed that he was trained to conduct the four accuracy tests at both training sessions, and he testified as to the details of each of the four tests for inspecting and testing the accuracy of the LIDAR device. He testified as to how he was trained to obtain a speed measurement and how to read the accuracy results, as well as the results of the speed measurement. Thus, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in determining that there was sufficient foundation to establish Sergeant Takushi's training as foundation for the admission of the LIDAR speed reading. 
(2) The District Court determined and informed the 
parties that it would treat Officer Gazelle as a lay witness, not an expert witness, and that the court would allow Officer Gazelle 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to testify as to his observations of Ah Mow, not as "clues of 
intoxication." 
It is well-established that an arresting officer is 
permitted to testify as to his or her observations of a defendant's physical performance on an SFST. See State v. 
Ferrer, 95 Hawai# i 409, 427, 23 P.3d 744, 762 (App. 2001). 
However, effective prior to Ah Mow's arrest, the supreme court held that police officers can no longer testify, in either a lay or an expert capacity, that a driver appeared to be intoxicated. State v. Jones, 148 Hawai# i 152, 174, 468 P.3d 166, 188 (2020).
4 
Contrary to Ah Mow's assertions, as made clear in the 
District Court's oral findings and conclusions, the District Court properly considered Officer Gazelle's testimony recounting his observations of Ah Mow's physical actions and conduct as he performed the SFST. Officer Gazelle did not state an opinion as to Ah Mow's intoxication in his testimony; nor did the court improperly rely on any such opinion testimony. Rather, the court credited the officer's testimony based on the detail and description that was given concerning the officer's observations. 
Finally, Ah Mow submits that because the SFST "results" 
should not have been considered, there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction of OVUII. As we have rejected his challenge to Officer Gazelle's testimony, we conclude this argument is without merit. 
4 Nor can an officer testify that a defendant passed or failed an
SFST. Jones, 148 Hawai #i at 170, 468 P.3d at 184.
