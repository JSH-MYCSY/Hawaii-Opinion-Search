v. 
RANDY GARCIA, Defendant-Appellee,
and 
CHRISTOPHER REAMS, Defendant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CRIMINAL NO. 1CPC-20-0000586) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: 
Ginoza, Chief Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Plaintiff-Appellant State
 of Hawai# i appeals from the 
"Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and 
Order Granting 
Defendant[-Appellee Randy] Garcia's Motion to Dismiss Counts 4-7 
for Failure to Charge an Offense, Filed April 1, 2021," entered 
by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit on April 21, 2021.1 
For the reasons explained below, we vacate the Order and remand for further proceedings. 
On May 20, 2020, Garcia was charged with four counts of 
Forgery in the Second Degree (Counts 4-7) (among other things). 
Count 4 alleged, in relevant part: 
1 The Honorable Kevin A. Souza presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On or about October 9, 2019, in the City and County of
Honolulu, State of Hawai #i, RANDY GARCIA did, with intent to 
defraud, utter a forged instrument, to wit, First Hawaiian
Bank check #1877, drawn on the account of EAH Inc., madepayable to Randy Garcia in the amount of Two Thousand TwoHundred Fifty Dollars ($2,250.00), which is or purports tobe, or which is calculated to become or to represent ifcompleted, a deed, will, codicil, contract, assignment,commercial instrument, or other instrument which does or mayevidence, create, transfer, terminate, or otherwise affect alegal right, interest, obligation, or status, therebycommitting the offense of Forgery in the Second Degree, inviolation of Section 708-852 of the [Hawaii] RevisedStatutes. 
(Emphasis added.) Counts 5-7 contained similar allegations, 
differing only as to the dates of the alleged offense, the check numbers, and the check amounts. 
Garcia pleaded not guilty. He moved to dismiss Counts 
4-7. He argued that "the charging language in [Counts 4-7] fails [sic] to allege the requisite state of mind . . . in violation of [his] due process rights." 
Garcia's motion was heard on April 5, 2021. The 
circuit court orally granted the motion to dismiss. The Order was entered on April 21, 2021. The circuit court found and concluded: 
9. This Court finds that the Felony Information is
not sufficiently clear that the requisite state of mind for
the offenses charged in Counts 4 to 7 is "intentionally." 
10. This Court concludes that the Defendant's due 
process rights have been violated based on the omission ofthe requisite states of mind listed under the definition of"intent to defraud." 
11. This Court concludes that the failure to include 
the requisite states of mind in the Felony Information doesnot provide Defendant with fair notice of what he needs todefend against to avoid a conviction and, therefore, is aviolation of Defendant's due process rights. 
12. Because the Felony Information is deficient,
Counts 4 to 7 are to be dismissed without prejudice. 
This appeal by the State followed. The State raises a 
single point of error: 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"The circuit court erred in concluding that the
[charge] in this case did not provide Garcia with fair
notice of the state of mind that he needed to defend againstto avoid conviction for the Forgery in the Second Degreecharges against him[.]" 
"Whether a charge sets forth all the essential elements 
of a charged offense is a question of law, which we review under 
the de novo, or 'right/wrong,' standard." State v. Mita, 124 
Hawai#i 385, 389, 245 P.3d 458, 462 (2010) (cleaned up). 
The statute under which Garcia was charged, Hawaii 
Revised Statutes (
HRS) Section 708-852 (2014), provides in 
relevant part: 
Forgery in the second degree . (1) A person commits the
offense of forgery in the second degree if, with intent to 
defraud, the person falsely makes, completes, endorses, or
alters a written instrument, or utters a forged instrument,
. . . which is or purports to be, or which is calculated tobecome or to represent if completed, a . . . commercialinstrument[.] 
(Emphasis added.) 
HRS § 708-800 (2014) provides, in relevant part: 
"Intent to defraud"  means: 
(1) An intent to use deception to injure another's
interest which has value; or 
(2) Knowledge  by the defendant that the defendant is
facilitating an injury to another's interest which hasvalue. 
(Emphasis added.) 
HRS § 702-204 (2014) provides: 
State of mind required . Except as provided in section
702-212,[2] a person is not guilty of an offense unless the
person acted intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, ornegligently, as the law specifies, with respect to eachelement of the offense. When the state of mind required toestablish an element of an offense is not specified by thelaw, that element is established if, with respect thereto, aperson acts intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly. 
2 HRS § 702-212 (2014) pertains to violations and to strict
liability crimes defined by statutes other than the Hawaii Penal Code. 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The charging document was required to allege Garcia's 
state of mind. The State alleged that Garcia acted with "intent 
to defraud[.]" The charge did not recite the definition of "intent to defraud" contained in HRS § 708-800. However, the State is not required to provide a statutory definition in every charge which "tracks the language of a statute that includes terms defined elsewhere in the [penal] code." Mita, 124 Hawai# i 
at 391-92, 245 P.3d at 464-65. 
"[T]he State need only allege the 
statutory definition of a term when it creates an additional essential element of the offense, and the term itself does not provide a person of common understanding with fair notice of that element." Id. at 392, 245 P.3d at 465. 
In 
State v. Anzai, No. CAAP-13-0000068, 2015 WL 2170449 
(Haw. App. May 8, 2015) (SDO), cert. rejected, No. SCWC-13-0000068, 2015 WL 5123489 (Haw. Aug. 28, 2015), we held that the term "intent to defraud" as defined by HRS § 708-800 did not create an additional element of the offense of shoplifting, and that the statutory definition was consistent with its commonly understood meaning. Id. at *1. The shoplifting statute, HRS 
§ 708-830(8) (2014), provided in relevant part: 
(8) Shoplifting. 
(a) A person conceals or takes possession of the
goods or merchandise of any store or retail
establishment, with intent to defraud . 
(b) A person alters the price tag or other price
marking on goods or merchandise of any store or retailestablishment, with intent to defraud . 
(c) A person transfers the goods or merchandise of
any store or retail establishment from one containerto another, with intent to defraud . 
(Emphasis added.) The charge in Anzai stated: 
On or about the 21st day of May, 2012, in the District ofSouth Kohala, County and State of Hawai #i, KANIAULONO ANZAI,
with intent to defraud , concealed or took possession of the
goods or merchandise of a store or retail establishment,that is amaretto liquor belonging to ISLAND GOURMET MARKET,and the value of said property did not exceed $100, therebycommitting the offense of Theft in the Fourth Degree 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(Shoplifting), in violation of Sections 708–830(8) and
708–833(1), [Hawaii] Revised Statutes, as amended. 
Anzai, 2015 WL 2170449, at *1. (Emphasis added.) The defendant 
claimed the charge failed to inform him of the nature and cause of the accusation against him because it failed to state an essential element of the offense — the statutory definition of "intent to defraud[.]" We rejected the defendant's claim, stating: 
The statutory definition of "intent to defraud," does
not create an additional element of the offense . The intent 
requirement itself is an element of the offense. Similar to 
the crime charged in Mita, the definition of "intent todefraud" is consistent with its commonly understood meaningand sufficiently provided Anzai with notice of what wasbeing charged. Id. . . . Therefore, the charge was not
deficient. 
Id. at *1 (emphasis added) (citing Mita, 124 Hawai# i at 392, 245 
P.3d at 465). 
Similarly, in this case the charge against Garcia 
recited the "intent to defraud" element of HRS § 708-852 by 
tracking the language of the statute. The statutory definition of "intent to defraud" is consistent with its commonly understood meaning and does not create an additional element of the offense of Forgery in the Second Degree. Accordingly, the charge was sufficient. 
Based upon the foregoing, we vacate the Order entered 
by the circuit court on April 21, 2021, and remand for further proceedings.
