(CASE NO. 2DCW-21-0000593)  
 
  
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
WAILUKU DIVISION 
  
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Hiraoka and Nakasone, JJ.)
 
 
  In this consolidated appeal,1 Defendant-Appellant David 
M. Maile (Maile) appeals from two separate Judgments and Notices 
 
 1 Maile filed Notices of Appeal on May 17, 2021 in CAAP- 21-0000329 
and CAAP- 21-0000330.  T his court consolidated the appeals under CAAP- 21-
0000329 on June 29, 2021. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST 'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2 of Entry of Judgment in underlying Case No. 2DCW-21-0000592 and 
Case No. 2DCW-21-0000593, both filed and entered on May 14, 2021 
by the District Court of the Second Circuit (District Court).   
After separate bench trials in each case, Maile was convicted of 
Criminal Contempt of Court ( Contempt of Court ) in violation of 
Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 710-1077(1)(g).   32
Maile raises three points of error on appeal as to 
each underlying conviction, contending that the District Court 
erred by: (1) convicting Maile of Contempt of Court due to 
insufficient evidence; (2) denying Maile's Motions to Dismiss 
because his conviction for a separate Contempt of Court charge 
required joinder of his Contempt of Court charges in the 
underlying cases and constituted double jeopardy; and (3) 
denying Maile's Motions to Dismiss because the complaints failed 
to state an offense as to the community service work (CSW) he 
was required to do or the deadline to do the CSW and to pay 
fines/fees. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve 
Maile's points of error as follows, and reverse. 
On March 29, 2021, the Plaintiff-Appellee State of 
Hawai‘i (State) filed three criminal complaints against Maile, 
charging him with Contempt of Court arising from failing to 
appear at a compliance hearing before the District Court.  Maile  
2The Honorable Christopher M. Dunn presided over the trial and 
signed the May 14, 2021 Judgment and Notice of Entry of Judgment. 
3HRS § 710- 1077(1)(g) (2014) states in pertinent part, "(1) A 
person commits the offense of criminal contempt of court if: . . . (g) The 
person knowingly disobeys or resists the process, injunction, or other 
mandate of a court[.]" NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST 'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 pled no contest to the first complaint.  The second complaint, 
filed in Case No. 2DCW-21-0000592, alleged that, on March 16, 
2021, Maile failed to appear in the District Court for proof of 
compliance of CSW and "fail[ed] to complete twenty (20) hours of 
[CSW] arising from his conviction for Theft in the Fourth Degree 
in case number 2DCW-19-0001396 . . . ."  The third complaint, 
filed in Case No. 2DCW-21-0000593, alleged that, on March 16, 
2021, Maile failed to appear in the District Court for proof of 
compliance of fines and "fail[ed] to complete payment of $220.00 
in fines and fees arising from his conviction for Theft in the 
Fourth Degree in case number 2DCW-19-0001531 . . . . " 
  On April 1, 2021, Maile filed his Motions to Dismiss 
the second and third complaints.  Following a hearing on April 
16, 2021, the District Court denied the Motions to Dismiss and 
ordered Maile to appear for a jury-waived trial in both cases.4  
  Trial commenced on May 14, 2021.  In Case No. 2DCW-21-
0000592, the parties stipulated to identification and notice of 
Maile's March 16, 2021 court date.  The State admitted into 
evidence, with no objection from Maile, the following exhibits: 
(1) Return of Service on Bench Warrant in Maile's theft case; 
(2) Order and Notice of Entry of Order in Maile's theft case; 
(3) Bench Warrant ordered on March 16, 2021 in Maile's theft 
case; (4) Minutes for Maile's theft case.  Through these 
exhibits, the State sought to demonstrate that "on March 16th, 
2021 [Maile] failed to appear before this court as ordered by 
the bench warrant served on [Maile] [sic] February 11th, 2021." 
Maile testified in his defense.

2021 hearing.

4 The District Court found Maile guilty of Contempt of 
Court in Case No. 2DCW-21-0000592.  The District Court then 
conducted the trial for Case No. 2DCW-21-0000593, with the 
parties stipulating to the same type of evidence that was 
admitted in Case No. 2DCW-21-0000592.  The District Court found 
Maile guilty of Contempt of Court in Case No. 2DCW-21-0000593.5 
This timely appeal followed. 
(1)Maile contends that the District Court erred in
convicting Maile of Contempt of Court in both Case Nos. 2DCW-21-
0000592 and 2DCW-21-0000593 because there was insufficient 
evidence to support the convictions.  The State concedes that 
there was insufficient evidence to support Maile's convictions 
and recommends reversal of Maile's convictions.  
We have considered the State's concession of error, 
and upon our review of the record, determine that the concession 
is supported by the record and the law.  See State v. 
Eduwensuyi, 141 Hawai‘ i 328, 337, 409 P.3d 732, 741 (2018) ("A 
prosecutor's confession, although not binding on an appellate 
court, is 'entitled to great weight.'") (internal citation 
omitted)).  We hold that there was insufficient evidence to 
support Maile's convictions.  Here, the complaints in both cases 
charged Maile with failing to comply with court orders in the 
underlying judgments for the theft convictions, but as the State 
notes, those judgments were not introduced into evidence. 
In reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of 
evidence, "evidence adduced in the trial court must be 
considered in the strongest light for the prosecution."  State
  381, 392, 491 P.3d 592, 603 (2021) v. Williams, 149 Hawai‘i 
5In its Answering Brief, the State notes that: "[a] review of the 
trial transcript and the State's Exhibits shows that the Judgment of 
Conviction and Sentence" for the underlying theft cases in Case Nos. 2DCW- 19-
0001531 and 2DCW- 19
-0001396 "were not introduced into evidence."  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST 'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
5 (internal brackets omitted) (quoting State v. Kalaola, 124 
Hawai‘i 43, 49, 237 P.3d 1109, 1115 (2010)).  On appeal, the test
is "whether there was substantial evidence to support the 
conclusion of the trier of fact." Id. (internal quotation marks  
omitted) (quoting Kalaola, 124 Hawai ‘i at 49, 237 P.3d at 1115).  
Pursuant to HRS § 710-1077(1)(g), "(1) A person 
commits the offense of criminal contempt of court if: . . . (g) 
The person knowingly disobeys or resists the process, 
injunction, or other mandate of a court[.]" (emphasis added). 
Under the statute, the State had to prove that (1) Maile failed 
to appear in court, and (2) knowingly disobeyed or resisted  
completing his sentence.  As to "knowingly disobeying or 
resisting" his sentence, the record reflects that in Case No. 
2DCW-21-0000592, Maile was charged with failure to complete  
twenty hours of CSW, and in Case No. 2DCW-21-0000593, failure to  
pay the $220 fine in his theft cases.  See id.  However, the  
trial transcript and the State's exhibits reflect that, while  
the defense's stipulation and the State's exhibits admitted at  
trial established identity and notice of the March 16, 2021  
hearing, the admitted evidence did not establish that Maile was 
informed of his sentence by the court to perform CSW and to pay 
a fine and fees from his sentence for his theft convictions.  
Thus, there was insufficient evidence to support the element  
that Maile "knowingly disobeyed or resisted . . . a mandate by 
the court" under HRS § 710-1077(1)(g).  See HRS § 710-
1077(1)(g); Williams, 124 Hawai‘ i at 392, 237 P.3d at 603.  Thus, 
we conclude that the District Court erred, as there was a lack 
of substantial evidence to support Maile's convictions, and that 
his convictions must be reversed.  See id. 
(2)Based on the above, it is not necessary to address
Maile's remaining points of error. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST 'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
