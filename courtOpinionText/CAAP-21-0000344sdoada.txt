In February 2013, MJF Development Corporation, Greene 
Lane Capital LLC, Dennis W. Mahoney as Trustee of the 
Declaration of Revocable Trust of Dennis W. Mahoney Dated 
November 14, 2004, and Renee E. Mola formed Hawai‘i limited 
partnership Pumehana Hui LP. On February 22, 2013, general 
partner MJF,2 and limited partners Greene Lane, Mahoney, and 
Renee entered into Pumehana's limited partnership agreement. Pumehana's sole purpose was "to engage in the business of 
owning, developing, operating and disposing of a real estate 
development project" of 180 affordable condominium units located 
at 929 Pumehana Street (Project). 
On March 10, 2020, MJF filed an amended application 
for judicial dissolution. MJF then moved for summary judgment, which was granted. On April 22, 2021, the circuit court entered 
final judgment in favor of MJF and against Greene Lane. Greene

Lane appealed, creating CAAP-21-0000344, and raises nine points 
of error. 
On May 21, 2021, Greene Lane moved for relief from the 
final judgment under Hawai‘ i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) 
Rule 60(b)(4),3 which the circuit court denied. Greene Lane 
appealed, creating CAAP-21-0000475, and raises two additional 
points of error.4 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve this 
appeal as discussed below, and affirm. 
(1) Greene Lane's first and seventh points of error 
are related. Greene Lane contends the circuit court erred in not requiring MJF to file a complaint and in treating the case 
as a special proceeding outside of the HRCP. Greene Lane also 
contends it was denied due process because "[t]he whole point of 
the HRCP, of course, is to provide that very process from the 
outset." 
3 HRCP Rule 60(b)(4) provides: "[o]n motion and upon such terms as are 
just, the court may relieve a party or a party's legal representative from a 
final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: . . . (4) the judgment is void[.]" 
4 Greene Lane actually raises eight points of error on appeal in CAAP-
21-0000475, and the first six points are substantially the same as the points 
raised in CAAP- 21-0000344. Thus, we address the two additional points 
raised. 
On April 29, 2022, this court entered an order consolidating CAAP- 21-
0000344 and CAAP- 21-0000475.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The amended application for judicial dissolution was 
filed pursuant to Hawai‘i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 425E-802 
(2004). HRS § 425E-802 provides that the circuit court may 
order a limited partnership's dissolution upon "application by a 
partner[.]" Though HRS Chapter 425E does not define the term 
"application," it is generally defined as "[a] request or 
petition." See HRS § 1-14 (2009); Application, Black's Law
Dictionary (12th ed. 2024). 
Petitions are treated as complaints commencing civil 
actions where a statute or court rule requires a particular 
cause of action be commenced by a petition. See Hawaii Home
Infusion Assocs. v. Befitel
, 114 Hawai‘ i 87, 88 n.2, 157 P.3d 
526, 527 n.2 (2007); In re Lease Cancellation of Smith, 68 Haw. 
466, 468, 719 P.2d 397, 399 (1986). Thus, MJF was not required to file a "complaint." See generally Lau v. Wong, 1 Haw. App. 
217, 219, 616 P.2d 1031, 1033 (1980) (indicating circuit court had power to hear partner's application for decree of 
dissolution). 
And no authority indicates an HRS § 425E-802 special 
proceeding is outside the HRCP. See HRCP Rule 81(i) ("Except as 
otherwise provided in Rule 72 or in this Rule 81, these rules shall apply to all actions and proceedings of a civil nature in 
any circuit court . . . and for that purpose every action or 
4    
 
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
proceeding of a civil nature in the circuit court shall be a 
'civil action' within the meaning of Rule 2.") (emphasis added). 
Thus, the circuit court did not err in proceeding with 
MJF's amended application in the underlying special proceeding, 
and did not deny Greene Lane due process based on its HRCP 
argument. 
(2) In its second, third, and fourth points of error, 
Greene Lane contends the circuit court abused its discretion in not joining Mahoney or Pumehana as parties to the special 
proceeding and erred in hearing the merits of the case without 
first joining Mahoney or Pumehana. 
Mahoney was named as a respondent to the special 
proceeding in MJF's amended application for judicial 
dissolution, as Greene Lane concedes in its opening brief filed 
in CAAP-21-0000344. 
As to Greene Lane's arguments that Pumehana was a 
necessary party, the Uniform Limited Partnership Act (ULPA) and the 2001 version of the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act 
(RULPA), "do not require that the partnership itself, as an 
entity, be a party to an action seeking its own judicial 
dissolution and winding up." Matz v. Bennion, 961 S.W.2d 445, 
454 (Tex. App. 1997) (determining as all partners or their representatives were before the court "it had jurisdiction to 
judicially dissolve the partnerships"). 
5    
 
  
 
  
 
   
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Greene Lane's assertion that it was improper for the 
circuit court to hear the merits of the case without first 
joining Mahoney or Pumehana lacks support because all necessary 
parties to the proceeding were joined. 
Thus, the circuit court did not err or abuse its 
discretion. 
(3) In its fifth point of error, Greene Lane contends 
the circuit court abused its discretion in "truncating the discovery process" as the circuit court did not grant the 
request for an HRCP Rule 56(f) continuance.
5 (Formatting 
altered.) 
A request for continuance "must demonstrate how 
postponement of a ruling on the motion will enable [the litigant], by discovery or other means, to rebut the [summary 
judgment] movants' showing of absence of a genuine issue of 
fact." Acoba v. Gen. Tire, Inc., 92 Hawai‘ i 1, 9, 986 P.2d 288, 
296 (1999) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
5 HRCP Rule 56(f) provides: 
Should it appear from the affidavits of a party opposing 
the motion that the party cannot for reasons stated present 
by affidavit facts essential to justify the party's opposition, the court may refuse the application for 
judgment or may order a continuance to permit affidavits to 
be obtained or depositions to be taken or discovery to be 
had or may make such other order as is just. 
6    
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Here, Greene Lane sought a continuance to conduct 
extensive discovery, anticipating "that it will take 3-6 months 
to propound adequate written discovery on the parties and 
entities[.]" Greene Lane explained that "discovery would be 
relevant to whether Pumehana can practicably carry on in 
accordance with its Partnership Agreement." 
Assuming, arguendo, Greene Lane met its burden, there 
was no abuse of discretion. Following a hearing on the matter, the circuit court granted Greene Lane a 45-day continuance to 
conduct discovery as to Pumehana's "current debt and liabilities 
and assets as well as its entitlements for the development 
(described in paragraph 2.2 of the Limited Partnership 
Agreement) and the current status of development." (Emphases 
omitted.) The circuit court also allowed Greene Lane to 
"inquire as to the feasibility of obtaining refinancing for the 
development going forward[,]" via a deposition of MJF. 
(Emphasis omitted.) The circuit court then instructed that "[i]f issues arise regarding the scope of permissible discovery 
or its timing, the parties shall request a further Rule 16 
conference with the Court." (Emphasis added.) 
Greene Lane does not assert, and the record does not 
show, it requested a further conference. The circuit court thus 
did not abuse its discretion. 
7    
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(4)  In its sixth point of error, Greene Lane contends 
the circuit court erred in granting MJF's summary judgment 
motion, determining there was no genuine issue of material fact. 
Greene Lane also contends the circuit court abused its 
discretion in denying Greene Lane's motion for reconsideration. 
(a) Motion for Summary Judgment 
Greene Lane argues "[t]he Partners were not 
'hopelessly deadlocked'" and the "spirited communications" 
represented "resolvable discord between the Partners." 
As MJF initiated the proceeding below and moved for 
summary judgment, it bore the burden to show there was not a 
"genuine issue of material fact" as "to the essential elements 
of the claim" and that it was "entitled to summary judgment as a 
matter of law." Ralston v. Yim , 129 Hawai‘i 46, 56, 292 P.3d 
1276, 1286 (2013) (citation omitted). If MJF satisfies this 
burden, the burden shifts to Greene Lane to demonstrate "the 
existence of a triable, material factual issue" or adduce 
"evidence of material facts which demonstrate the existence of 
affirmative defenses that would defeat the plaintiff's claim." 
Ocwen Fed. Bank, FSB v. Russell
, 99 Hawai‘i 173, 183, 53 P.3d 
312, 322 (App. 2002) (citation omitted). 
To support its claims that dissolution was necessary 
as the partners were deadlocked in a dispute and Pumehana's purpose could no longer be fulfilled due to the Project's 
8    
 
  
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"imminent foreclosure[,]" MJF provided copies of e-mails and 
texts from Greene Lane's member-manager Yang Suh requesting 
information from Franco, and indicating Suh would not approve 
new financing agreements to pay off the Bank of Hawaii Note due 
to his deepening frustration with, and hostility towards Franco 
and Renee regarding the partnership and proposed financing 
agreements. 
Some of Suh's messages included insults, swearing, 
threats (including litigation and indicating he would pay a houseless individual $1,000 to defecate on Franco's grave), and 
character attacks directed at Franco, Renee, their children, and 
others. 
Various ULPA/RULPA jurisdictions across the country 
have held that management deadlock, "evidence of ill-will, 
dissension, and antagonism between the partners[,]" or "an 
irreparable deterioration of a relationship between partners" 
are valid bases for dissolution. See, e.g., In re Rueth Dev.Co., 976 N.E.2d 42, 55 (Ind. Ct. App. 2012); Cobin v. Rice, 823 
F. Supp. 1419, 1426 (N.D. Ind. 1993); Brennan v. Brennan 
Assocs., 977 A.2d 107, 120, 120 n.14 (Conn. 2009).  
Based on the evidence it presented, MJF showed there 
was no genuine issue as to the partners' relationship, and that 
it was "not reasonably practicable to carry on the activities of 
9    
 
  
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the limited partnership in conformity with the partnership 
agreement." HRS § 425E-802. 
The burden then shifted to Greene Lane, which did not 
produce any evidence to support its claims that the messages 
reflected "mere discord" between the parties or that there were 
issues as to whether Pumehana could carry on its activities in 
conformity with its partnership agreement. See Russell, 99 
Hawai‘i at 183, 53 P.3d at 322. 
Thus, the circuit court did not err in granting MJF's 
summary judgment motion. 
(b) Motion for Reconsideration 
Greene Lane also contends the circuit court abused its 
discretion in denying its motion for reconsideration because the City Council's extension of the Project's construction deadline 
"from May 6, 2021, to May 6, 2024" was "newly discovered 
evidence" as the extension was approved after the circuit 
court's hearing on MJF's summary judgment motion. 
[T]he purpose of a motion for reconsideration is to allow 
the parties to present new evidence and/or arguments that 
could not have been presented during the earlier 
adjudicated motion. Reconsideration is not a device to 
relitigate old matters or to raise arguments or evidence that could and should have been brought during the earlier 
proceeding. 
Cho v. State , 115 Hawai‘i 373, 384, 168 P.3d 17, 28 (2007) 
(citation omitted). 
10    
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On August 24, 2020, Greene Lane notified the circuit 
court that a resolution to extend the construction deadline was 
pending approval from city authorities. The hearing on the 
motion for summary judgment was on September 3, 2020, where the 
circuit court took the matter under advisement, issuing no oral 
ruling. The City Council extended the construction deadline on 
September 9, 2020. The circuit court entered its order granting 
summary judgment on October 5, 2020. See generally Sousaris v.
Miller
, 92 Hawai‘i 505, 514, 993 P.2d 539, 548 (2000); 
Cho
, 115 
Hawai‘i at 384, 168 P.3d at 28.   
Because Greene Lane knew the proposal to extend the 
construction deadline was pending and the City Council extended 
the deadline about a month before the circuit court ruled on the 
motion for summary judgment, the extension could have been presented to the circuit court prior to its ruling on the motion 
and was not "new" evidence. 
Even if the extension was new 
evidence, it was not material to the issue of ill-will, dissension, and antagonism among the parties to create a genuine 
issue of material fact. 
Thus, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion 
in denying Greene Lane's motion for reconsideration. 
(5) In its eighth point of error, Greene Lane 
contends the circuit court abused its discretion by "not adequately screen[ing] this matter for a conflict of 
11    
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
interest[,]" arguing "[t]he appearance of impropriety and 
partiality is present because, while in private practice, Judge 
Cataldo was adverse to Mahoney in two lawsuits." 
Greene Lane appears to primarily rely on Hawai‘ i 
Revised Code of Judicial Conduct (HRCJC) Rule 2.11 to support 
its arguments. HRCJC Rule 2.11(a)(6)(A) requires that a judge 
disqualify or recuse themselves if the judge "served as a lawyer 
in the matter in controversy": 
(a) Subject to the rule of necessity, a judge shall 
disqualify or recuse himself or herself in any proceeding 
in which the judge's impartiality* might reasonably be 
questioned, including but not limited to the following 
circumstances: 
 . . . . 
(6) The judge: 
(A) served as a lawyer in the matter in controversy, 
or was associated with a lawyer who participated 
substantially as a lawyer in the matter during 
such association[.] 
(Formatting altered and emphasis added.) 
Though HRCJC does not explain what constitutes a 
"matter in controversy," this court has determined "the term 
'matter' appears to refer to a case (which will have a 'final 
disposition') before the court, not other cases involving the 
same or similar issues." Kondaur Cap. Corp. v. Matsuyoshi
, 150 
Hawai‘i 1, 15, 496 P.3d 479, 493 (App. 2021). 
12    
 
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Here, the two lawsuits Judge Cataldo was purportedly 
adverse to Mahoney were case numbers 1CC161001492 and 
1CC171001820, both entitled Visionsafe Corp. et al. v. Cades 
Schutte LLP et al., which asserted legal malpractice claims. 
Mahoney was one of the plaintiffs in the Visionsafe 
lawsuits. Judge Cataldo was employed at McCorriston Miller 
Mukai MacKinnon, which represented Cades in the Visionsafe 
lawsuits. 
But the Visionsafe lawsuits did not involve Pumehana, 
its financing, or dissolution of a partnership. Moreover, Judge Cataldo's participation in the Visionsafe lawsuits did not 
change the evidence presented with the motion for summary 
judgment in the special proceeding here - namely, Suh's 
contentious e-mails and refusal to agree on financing. 
And when the Visionsafe lawsuits were brought to the 
circuit court's attention, the instant special proceeding was 
reassigned to Judge Ochiai. Judge Ochiai presided over Greene Lane's motion for reconsideration and HRCP Rule 60(b)(4) motion. 
We decline to vacate the judgment in this case under 
these circumstances. 
(6) In its ninth point of error, Greene Lane contends 
the circuit court erred in "exercising jurisdiction over a 
[temporary restraining order (TRO)] matter" as "[o]nly the 
district courts have the authority to issue injunctions against 
13    
 
   
 
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
harassment[,]" under HRS § 604-10.5(b) (2016).6 (Some formatting 
altered.) 
"Hawai‘i courts 'have the inherent power and authority 
to control the litigation process before them and to curb abuses 
and promote fair process[.]'" Kaina v. Gellman, 119 Hawai‘ i 324, 
330, 197 P.3d 776, 782 (App. 2008) (citation omitted). 
"HRS 
§ 603-21.9(1) & (6) is a legislative restatement of the inherent 
powers doctrine." Id. at 331, 197 P.3d at 783 (footnote 
omitted). 
On March 30, 2020, the parties agreed contact would be 
through their attorneys following communications Suh sent to Franco and Renee. 
Suh, however, violated that agreement when he 
sent messages directly to Renee and/or Franco in June, August, and September 2020, regarding capital contributions, funding, the loan, their actions in the case, and their marriage 
(including "Go run to Lyle and Tobin. Get a tro on me. You 
twits."; "Right about now. You are trying to make me look like a 
bad guy in front of a judge."; "I can picture the self pity and 
acting the victim . . . seems like it's a common theme in your 
family. Communicate. It's healthy."). 
6 HRS § 604- 10.5(b) provides "[t]he district courts shall have the 
power to enjoin, prohibit, or temporarily restrain harassment." 
14    
 
  
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Renee requested sanctions and an order enjoining Suh 
from contacting her. 
The circuit court denied Renee's request for 
sanctions, as there was no court order in place when Suh 
violated the agreement to communicate through counsel. 
But, relying on its inherent powers under HRS § 603-
21.9 (2016),7 the circuit court enjoined Greene Lane, "through 
any of its agents, representatives, and member-managers," from 
communicating directly with Renee and required all contact to go 
through her counsel. The circuit court found that the elements 
to issue an injunction were met, and Greene Lane did not 
expressly challenge that finding on appeal. See Okada Trucking
Co. v. Bd. of Water Supply
, 97 Hawai‘i 450, 458, 40 P.3d 73, 81 
(2002) ("Findings of fact . . . not challenged on appeal are 
binding on the appellate court."). 
7 HRS § 603- 21.9 provides in pertinent part: 
The several circuit courts shall have power: 
(1) To make and issue all orders and writs necessary or 
appropriate in aid of their original or appellate 
jurisdiction; 
 . . . . 
(6)
 To make and award such judgments, decrees, orders, and 
mandates, issue such executions and other processes, and do such other acts and take such other steps as may be 
necessary to carry into full effect the powers which are 
or shall be given to them by law or for the promotion of 
justice in matters pending before them. 
15    
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Suh's violation of the agreement to communicate 
through counsel and continued communication with Renee dictated 
a need for the circuit court to control the litigation and curb 
abuses. Thus, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion by 
using its inherent powers to enjoin Greene Lane from directly 
contacting Renee. 
(7) Finally, in its two remaining points of error, 
Greene Lane challenges the denial of its HRCP Rule 60(b)(4) motion. 
Greene Lane first contends the circuit court erred 
when it denied Greene Lane's HRCP Rule 60(b)(4) motion as it 
applied "the wrong legal standards" at the June 15, 2021 hearing 
on the motion. 
Regardless of what the circuit court stated at the 
June 15, 2021 hearing, "a trial court's written order controls 
over its oral statements." State v. Milne
, 149 Hawai‘i 329, 335, 
489 P.3d 433, 439 (2021). 
In Conclusions of Law (
COL) 2 and 3 in the "Findings 
of Fact (FOF), COL, and Order Denying Greene Lane's HRCP 
Rule 60(b)(4) Motion," the circuit court cited language directly 
from HRCP Rule 60(b)(4) and noted "a judgment is void only if 
the court that rendered it lacked jurisdiction of either the 
subject matter or the parties or otherwise acted in a manner 
inconsistent with due process of law." (Emphases and citation 
16    
 
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
omitted.) This is the correct review of an HRCP Rule 60(b)(4) 
motion and Greene Lane does not challenge COL 2 and 3. 
Greene Lane next contends the circuit court violated 
its due process rights. 
"[D]ue process is flexible and calls for such 
procedural protections as the particular situation demands." 
Fujimoto v. Au
, 95 Hawai‘i 116, 164, 19 P.3d 699, 747 (2001) 
(citations omitted). "The basic elements of procedural due 
process of law require notice and an opportunity to be heard at 
a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner." Id.
 (citations 
omitted). 
Here, Greene Lane participated in the special 
proceeding below as it filed an answer to the amended 
application for judicial dissolution, multiple motions, and was 
represented by counsel at hearings on various motions. Greene 
Lane was not denied due process. 
Thus, the circuit court did not err in denying Greene 
Lane's HRCP Rule 60(b)(4) motion. 
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the circuit court's 
April 22, 2021 Final Judgment; June 16, 2020 Order Denying Motion to Dismiss MJF's Amended Application for Judicial 
Dissolution; October 5, 2020 Order Granting MJF's Summary
