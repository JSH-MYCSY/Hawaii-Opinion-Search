NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
NO. CAAP-21-0000345 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI#I 
RT, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
JG, Defendant-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(UCCJEA NO. 19-1-6010) 
ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of the July 12, 2021 "Motion to 
Dismiss for Lack of Appellate Jurisdiction" (Motion to Dismiss), 
by Defendant-Appellee JG (Mother), the papers in support, the 
record, and there being no opposition, it appears that the court 
lacks jurisdiction over the appeal by self-represented Plaintiff-Appellant RT (Father) because the Family Court of the First 
Circuit (family court) has not entered a final, appealable  
judgment or order. 
The underlying proceedings were initiated by a "Motion 
and Declaration for Post-Decree Relief" filed by Father on 
May 29, 2019, in which he seeks, 
inter alia, modification of 
custody, visitation, and child support. "A post-judgment order is an appealable final order under HRS § 641–1(a) if the order finally determines the post-judgment proceeding." 
Hall v. Hall
, 
96 Hawai#i 105, 111 n.4, 26 P.3d 594, 600 n.4 (App. 2001) 
(citation omitted), 
affirmed in part, and vacated in part on 
other grounds, Hall v. Hall
, 95 Hawai#i 318, 22 P.3d 965 (2001). 
In addition, the underlying case is a proceeding under the Uniform Child-Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRS § 583A-314 (2006) states in part, "[a]n appeal may be taken 
from a final order in a proceeding under [the UCCJEA] in accordance with expedited appellate procedures as in other civil cases." 
The notice of appeal indicates Father appeals from an 
order entered by the family court on May 20, 2021, but there is no written or verbal order in the record for that date. Also, the family court's May 3, 2021 "Order Re: [Mother's] [March 4, 2021] Motion to Change Family Therapist and for Father to Attend Individual Therapy" and May 11, 2021 "Order Re: Mother's Motion for Relocation and to Order [Father] to Remove Recorded Court Proceeding from YouTube, filed May 4, 2021" are not final and appealable because they do not finally determine the post-judgment proceedings pending in the family court. 
Because Father's appeal is premature, we lack appellate 
jurisdiction. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion to 
Dismiss is granted and the appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions in CAAP-
21-0000345 are dismissed.

Honolulu, Hawai#i, August 18, 2021.
