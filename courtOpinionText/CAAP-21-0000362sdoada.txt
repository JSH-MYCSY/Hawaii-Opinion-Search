v. 
JORGE BAILON PASCUA LAFRADEZ,
also known as BAILON PASCUA LAFRADEZ,
Defendant-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(
CASE NO.  1CPC-21-0000141) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and Nakasone, JJ.) 
Plaintiff-Appellant State of Hawai# i (State), appeals 
from the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law (
FOFs/COLs), and 
Order Granting Defendant-Appellee Jorge Bailon Pascua Lafradez, 
also known as, Bailon Pascua Lafradez's (Lafradez) Motion to 
Suppress Evidence (Order Granting Motion to Suppress Evidence), 
filed on May 11, 2021 by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit 
(Circuit Court).1 
Lafradez was charged via Felony Information with 
Promoting a Dangerous Drug in the Second Degree. On May 3, 2021, he filed a Motion to Suppress Evidence (Motion), which the 
Circuit Court granted. The State timely appealed. 
On appeal, the State contends that the Circuit Court 
erred in: (1) finding in FOF 6 that "Lafradez's [vehicle] was 
parked near the intersection of Auld Lane and Wong Lane;" (2) concluding that Lafradez's vehicle was not in violation of

Revised Ordinances of Honolulu (ROH) § 15-14.1(a)(3)2 and that 
therefore the officer did not have reasonable suspicion to 
approach the driver's window of the vehicle, challenging COLs 14, 18, 20, 29, and 31; and (3) suppressing all evidence of the bag of crystal methamphetamine that the officer saw from his position outside of the vehicle based on the Circuit Court's conclusions that the officer did not have a reasonable suspicion to approach the vehicle, and that the open view and plain view exceptions did not apply, challenging COLs 23, 24, 26, 28, 31, and 32. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve the State's points of error as follows, and affirm. 
The following evidence was adduced at the April 30, 
2021 suppression hearing. On September 9, 2020, Officer Alexander Watson (Officer Watson) approached a blue Kia (vehicle) 
with Kia dealer plates parked on the edge of a T-intersection of 
Auld Lane and Wong Lane to address a parking violation. See FOFs 
6, 7, 8, and 9.
3 The vehicle was not impeding traffic, and there 
were no signs that prohibited parking in the area. FOFs 9 and 10. Upon approach, Officer Watson observed Lafradez and other 
occupants through an open driver's seat window with no medical grade face coverings. See FOFs 7, 8, and 14. While standing 
outside of the vehicle, Officer Watson observed a clear transparent "baggy" (baggy) between Lafradez's legs, which he 
2 ROH § 15-14.1(a)(3)(Honolulu Supp. No. 30, 9-2017) states in
pertinent part: 
Sec. 15-14.1 Stopping, standing or parking prohibited
in specified places—No signs required.  (a) No person shall
stop, stand or park a vehicle, except when necessary to
avoid conflict with other traffic or in compliance with thelaw or the directions of a police officer or traffic controldevice, in any of the following places: 
. . . . 
(3)
 Within an intersection, along the edges or curbsides
around corners and in channelized areas of any twointersecting streets . . . . 
3 "It is well-established that . . . unchallenged findings of fact
are binding upon appellate courts." State v. Rodrigues, 145 Hawai #i 487, 497,
454 P.3d 428, 438 (2019) (citations omitted).

recognized to be crystal methamphetamine. FOFs 17 and 19. At 
the conclusion of the hearing, Lafradez argued that there was no parking violation under ROH § 15-14.1(a)(3), and thus no reasonable suspicion to validate Officer Watson's approach of the vehicle to be able to observe the baggy in open or plain view. The State argued that the Motion should be denied, because the open view exception to the warrant requirement applied, and that reasonable suspicion was not needed to justify the stop. Further, the State argued that even if this was not an open view case, there was nevertheless a parking violation and sufficient articulable facts establishing reasonable suspicion for Officer Watson to approach the vehicle and observe the baggy in plain view. 
(1) The State's contention that the Circuit Court erred 
in FOF 6 that Lafradez's vehicle was parked "near," rather than "within" the intersection, is without merit. FOF 6 states: 
6. Both officers encountered [the vehicle] with 'Aloha
Kia' plates, which was parked near the intersection ofAuld Lane and Wong Lane. 
(Emphasis added). The State argues that FOF 6 is clearly 
erroneous because Officer Watson testified that the vehicle was "parked within the intersection[.]"
4 (Emphasis added). 
4 Officer Watson testified that while on duty in his unmarked police
vehicle on September 9, 2020 at approximately 11:40 p.m., he came upon the
vehicle as follows: 
Q [By State] And when you're in that area, did
you at some point stop your vehicle? 
A [By Officer Watson] Yes. 
Q And why did -- did you stop your vehicle? A It's a blue Kia Sedona with Aloha Kia plates
parked within the intersection of I believe it was Auld
and Wong. So I stopped my vehicle to address thatparking violation. 
. . . . 
Q 
So in this T-intersection, can you describe
where the Kia Sedona vehicle was located in that T. 
A So the vehicle was parked on Auld Lane on the
south or makai bound side of the road within the I guessyou would say prolongations of Wong Lane or what I woulddefine as the intersection, T-intersection, of Auld and

We review findings of fact under the clearly erroneous 
standard of review. State v. Lawson, 103 Hawai# i 11, 19, 78 P.3d 
1159, 1167 (App. 2003) (citation omitted). A finding of fact is 
clearly erroneous when: 
"(1) the record lacks substantial 
evidence to support the finding, or (2) despite substantial evidence in support of the finding, the appellate court is nonetheless left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made." Id. 
Here, while the Circuit Court found that Officer Watson 
was credible (FOF 1), Lafradez's Motion contested the factual basis for the investigative stop and challenged whether any parking violation had occurred. In COL 14 and in its oral ruling, the Circuit Court explained that it had to independently determine whether there was, or appeared to be, a parking violation, rather than simply accepting the officer's claim of such violation. In COL 14, the Circuit Court stated that it "does not take Officer Watson at his word that there was a traffic violation, when the vehicle was blocking the intersection." 
In its oral ruling at the conclusion of the 
hearing, the Circuit Court explained that under the law, it had to determine whether Officer Watson's investigative stop was valid under Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968):
5 
And so that's the standard here -- is not just
to simply take Officer Watson at his word that there was
a traffic violation, namely, that the Kia Sedona wasblocking the intersection, which is what he alleged thetraffic violation was, but for the Court to look at allof the evidence submitted and to determine whether there were specific and articulable facts that a reasonableperson would be warranted in believing that criminalactivity was afoot. 
So in doing so, the Court doesn't only look at
Officer Watson's testimony. I look at all the evidencethat was submitted by the defense in this particular 
Wong
. 
(Emphases added). 
5 In Terry, the United States Supreme Court recognized "that a
police officer may in appropriate circumstances and in an appropriate mannerapproach a person for purposes of investigating possibly criminal behavioreven though there is no probable cause to make an arrest." Terry, 392 U.S. at
22.

case. I also look as a matter of law, as [Defense Counsel]
has correctly pointed out, to Revised Ordinances of HonoluluSection 15-14.1(a)(3), which the Court will adopt as partof its findings of fact in this particular case. 
. . . . 
. . . I look at Exhibits E –- or D, E, F, G, and H, it'sclear to this Court that indeed, as Officer Watsontestified, the Kia Sedona was parked alongside the curb, notblocking the intersection, it was not parked on any of thecorners, and there were no specific prohibitions or signsindicating there were prohibitions for the vehicle to beparked in that particular area. 
And so in looking at the test to determine whether
from the facts measured against an objective standard, didOfficer Watson have a reason to believe that criminal activity was afoot such that the action he took wasappropriate, in light of Revised Ordinances Section 15
-
14.1(a)(3) and the testimony and the evidence submitted tothe Court, the Court will find that Officer Watson did nothave reasonable suspicion or probable cause to approach thevehicle to investigate a parking violation on September 9,2020, at 11:40 p.m. 
The Circuit Court found in unchallenged COL 16, which 
is actually an FOF, that "the vehicle was not parked in the 
middle of the intersection, but rather parked near or along the curb on Auld Lane," and was "not impeding traffic, and it was not on the corners of the T-intersection." COL 16. In unchallenged COL 17, which is also an FOF, the Circuit Court found: "There were no red markings or any 'No Parking' signs or other signs where the vehicle was parked." 
At a motion to suppress hearing, "[t]he trial court, as 
the finder of fact, may draw reasonable and legitimate inferences and deductions from the evidence," and it is the province of the trial court "to assess the credibility of witnesses . . . and it may accept or reject such testimony in whole or in part." State 
v. Kaleohano, 99 Hawai# i 370, 376, 56 P.3d 138, 144 (2002) 
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
"Appellate 
courts defer to the judge or jury as fact finder unless no substantial evidence existed for their finding because the fact finder is uniquely qualified to evaluate the credibility of witnesses and to weigh the evidence." Wilton v. State, 116 
Hawai#i 106, 119, 170 P.3d 357, 370 (2007) (citation omitted). 
Here, the Circuit Court's factual finding, that 
Lafradez's vehicle was "near" the intersection and not "within" 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
it, was supported by COLs 16, 17, and Officer Watson's 
testimony.  The Circuit Court, as the fact finder, had the 
prerogative to reject Officer Watson's testimony in part, even6
 
while finding him credible. See Kaleohano, 99 Hawai# i at 376, 56 
P.3d at 144. The Circuit Court weighed and considered all of the evidence, assessed credibility, and drew reasonable and legitimate inferences and deductions to arrive at its factual finding that the vehicle was "near" the intersection and not "within" it. See id.; Wilton, 116 
Hawai#i at 119, 170 P.3d at 
370. The record reflects that FOF 6 was supported by substantial 
evidence and was not clearly erroneous. See Wilton, 116 Hawai# i 
at 119, 170 P.3d at 370; Lawson, 103 Hawai# i at 19, 78 P.3d at 
1167. 
(2) The State contends that the Circuit Court erred by 
concluding in COLs 14 and 18  that Lafradez's vehicle was not in 
violation of ROH § 15-14.1(a)(3), and also erred in COLs 18, 20, 7
6 In its oral ruling, the Circuit Court referenced Officer Watson's
responses to defense counsel's cross-examination, as follows: 
Court will note that [Defense Counsel] specifically
asked Officer Watson, Was the vehicle parked in the
middle of the intersection? He said no. The vehicle was parked along -- was parked near or along the curb on AuldLane facing south. 
[Defense Counsel] asked, Was it impeding traffic?
Officer Watson said, No, it was not impeding traffic.[Defense Counsel] asked, Was it parked on the corners of theT-intersection? 
Officer Watson said no. [Defense Counsel]
asked, Were there any red markings or any no-parkingsigns where the vehicle was parked? Officer Watson said no. 
7 COLs 14 and 18 stated: 
14. Therefore, the Court does not take Officer Watson at
his word that there was a traffic violation, when the
vehicle was blocking the intersection. 
. . . . 
18. Based upon the testimony of Officer Watson and theevidence submitted, the Court finds that OfficerWatson did not have reasonable suspicion or probablecause to approach the vehicle to investigate a parkingviolation on September 9, 2020 at 11:40 p.m. 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
29, and 31,8 that Officer Watson did not have reasonable 
suspicion to approach the vehicle. This contention is without 
merit. 
A trial court's conclusions of law are freely 
reviewable on appeal under the "right/wrong" standard of review. Kaleohano, 99 Hawai# i at 375, 56 P.3d at 143. A COL that 
presents mixed questions of fact and law is reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard because the court's conclusions are dependent on the facts and circumstances of each individual case. State v. Rapozo, 123 Hawai# i 329, 336, 235 P.3d 325, 332 (2010) 
(citation omitted). 
As to COL 14, where the Circuit Court concluded that it 
"does not take Officer Watson at his word that there was a traffic violation," the Circuit Court correctly acknowledged its duty as the fact finder as to this disputed fact. See discussion 
supra. The State does not present any argument to the contrary. 
As to COL 18, which contained the conclusion that 
Officer Watson did not have reasonable suspicion or probable cause to investigate a parking violation, the State argues the Circuit Court was wrong, based on Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 
§§ 291C-1 (defining "intersection"), 291C-111 (parking 
prohibitions in a T-shaped intersection) and a diagram in its Opening Brief -- which the State claims all show that ROH § 15-
8 COLs 20, 29 and 31 stated: 
20. Defendant was unlawfully seized within the meaning of
the Fourth Amendment at the time Officer Watson approached him and looked into the vehicle. 
. . . . 
29. The Court finds that Officer Watson had no reasonable suspicion or probable cause to approach the vehicle toinvestigate the traffic infraction based on theCourt's analysis of the Revised Ordinances ofHonolulu. Therefore, the totality of the evidenceindicates that there was no reasonable suspicion orprobable cause to investigate the traffic violation. 
. . . . 
31. In the instant case, but for Officer Watsonapproaching and seizing Defendant without probablecause or reasonable suspicion, the resultingcontraband would not have been discovered. 
7  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
14.1(d)(3) prohibits parking anywhere within the "I" areas marked 
on the diagram.9 The State argues that "the testimony of Officer 
Watson and the photographs introduced into evidence by Lafradez show that Lafradez was parked along the curb 'within' the top part of the T-intersection as illustrated by the area marked 'I' in the diagram." These arguments supra, citing to HRS §§ 291C-1, 291C-111(a) and utilizing a diagram, were not made below. Instead, at the hearing and in its Memorandum in Opposition to the motion, the State argued that the "open view" or, alternatively, "plain view" exceptions applied to the seizure of Lafradez because there was sufficient evidence to prove reasonable suspicion for Officer Watson to approach the vehicle. We do not consider the State's newly raised arguments relying on HRS Chapter 291C statutes and on a diagram that is not part of the record on appeal. See State v. Moses, 102 Hawai# i 449, 456, 
77 P.3d 940, 947 (2003) ("As a general rule, if a party does not 
raise an argument at trial, that argument will be deemed to have 
been waived on appeal[.]"); State v. Hoglund, 71 Haw. 147, 150, 785 P.2d 1311, 1313 (1990) ("Generally, the failure to properly raise an issue at the trial level precludes a party from raising that issue on appeal.") (citation omitted). 
COL 18's conclusion that there was no reasonable 
suspicion or probable cause for Officer Watson to approach and investigate the vehicle, is a mixed question of fact and law that is supported by the Circuit Court's findings that include FOF 6 and COLs 16 and 17, discussed supra, and is not clearly erroneous. See Rapozo, 123 Hawai# i at 336, 235 P.3d at 332. 
COLs 20, 29, and 31 all explain and apply the Circuit Court's conclusion that Lafradez was unlawfully seized because there was no reasonable suspicion or probable cause to investigate a traffic infraction, and that the contraband was discovered because of the unlawful seizure. These COLs logically follow from COL 18 and are not wrong. 
Nor does the State present 
9 A diagram of the intersection appears on page 10, in the Argument
section of the Opening Brief. This diagram does not contain any record
references as required by Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(7),
and does not appear to be a part of the record. 
The State did not refer to or 
introduce this diagram into evidence at the suppression hearing. 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
specific argument as to why these particular COLs are wrong. 
Therefore, the Circuit Court's conclusions that based on the evidence presented, there was no violation of ROH § 15-14.1(a)(3), and thus no reasonable suspicion justifying the seizure, were not wrong. See Kaleohano, 99 Hawai# i at 375, 56 
P.3d at 143. 
(3) The State's final contention is that "[b]ecause 
Officer Watson had a reasonable suspicion to approach the [vehicle]," the Circuit Court erred in concluding in COLs 23, 24, 26, 28, 31 and 32,
10 that the "open view or plain view exceptions 
did not apply,"11 and the Circuit Court "erred in suppressing all 
10 These COLs stated: 
23. The Court finds that the open view exception does not
apply to the instant case as the officers were notsimply passersby on the sidewalk inadvertently observingcontraband. 
24. But for Officer Watson approaching and standingoutside of the driver’s window on Auld Road, the areawhere he observed the baggy was not something that wasknowingly exposed to the public. 
. . . . 
26. Therefore, the open view exception does not apply. 
. . . . 
28. The plain view exception does not apply to the instantcase. 
. . . . 
31. In the instant case, but for Officer Watsonapproaching and seizing Defendant without probablecause or reasonable suspicion, the resultingcontraband would not have been discovered. 
32. Therefore, as no exceptions apply and Defendant wasseized without a warrant, the Court will ordersuppression of the use of evidence at trial that comesto light as a result of the exploitation of a previousillegal act of the police. See State v. Tominiko
, 126
Haw. 68, 266 P.3d 1122 (2011). Evidence of the baggy,containing 4.091 grams of methamphetamine, and anyother items sought to be suppressed by the Defendantis suppressed. 
11 For the "open view" exception to apply, the officer's observation
must take place "from a non-intrusive vantage point." State v. Meyer, 78 Haw.
308, 313, 893 P.2d 159, 164 (1995) (citing State v. Kaaheena, 59 Haw. 23, 29,575 P.2d 462, 467 (1978)). Here, Officer Watson's observation did not occurfrom a non-intrusive vantage point because the observation occurred after

evidence" of the baggy. The arguments supporting the State's 
final contention of error are premised on the State's repeated contention that Officer Watson had reasonable suspicion and the seizure was justified –- a contention that we have already rejected supra. Because the State's challenges to COLs 23, 24, 26, 28, 31 and 32 are all based on this rejected premise, they are also without merit. 
For the foregoing reasons, the Findings of Fact, 
Conclusions of Law, and Order Granting Defendant-Appellee Jorge Bailon Pascua Lafradez's Motion to Suppress Evidence, filed on May 11, 2021 by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit, is affirmed.

Lafradez had already been illegally seized; thus, the Circuit Court correctlyconcluded that the "open view" exception did not apply in COLs 23, 24 and 26.See Kaleohano, 99 Hawai #i at 375, 56 P.3d at 143. For the "plain view"
exception to apply, the officer's plain view observation must occur after anintrusion and the intrusion must be justified. Meyer, 78 Haw. at 314-15, 893
P.2d at 165-66 (citation omitted). 
Here, Officer Watson's observation did not
occur after an intrusion that was justified, but rather occurred during anunlawful seizure; thus, the Circuit Court correctly concluded that the "plainview" exception did not apply in COL 28. See Kaleohano, 99 Hawai #i at 375, 56
P.3d at 143.
