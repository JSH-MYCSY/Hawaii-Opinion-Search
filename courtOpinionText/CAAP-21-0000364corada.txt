TROY D. BORGE, JR., Defendant-Appellant.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
(CASE NO. 2CPC-20-0000288)
ORDER OF CORRECTION
(By:  McCullen, J., for the court )1
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Summary Disposition Order
entered on September 14, 2022 (docket no. 70) in the above case
is corrected as follows:
The date of the Judgment; Conviction and Sentence in
the last paragraph on page 14 is incorrect.  The correct date
should be June 7, 2021 so that the paragraph reads:  "Based on
the foregoing, we hold that the circuit court did not err in
denying Borge's Motion to Dismiss and ordering restitution to the
CW, and affirm the circuit court's June 7, 2021 Judgment;
Conviction and Sentence."
The Clerk of the Court is directed to take all
necessary steps to notify the publishing agencies of this change.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, October 19, 2022.
