May 11, 2021 Decision and Order Affirming the [Hawaii Labor 
Relation Board (HLRB or the Board)] Order No. 3658 Dated 
September 23, 2020 (Order Affirming Order No. 3658), entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court),
3 in favor 
of Complainant-Appellee Hawaii Fire Fighters Association, IAFF, 
Local 1463, AFL-CIO (HFFA). 
HFFA is an employee organization within the meaning of 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 89-2 (2012) and duly certified as 
the exclusive bargaining representative of all fire fighters in 
bargaining unit 11 (BU 11), effective February 4, 1972. Section 
6 of the BU 11 Collective Bargaining Agreement, effective July 1, 
2011, to June 20, 2017 (Agreement), provides in relevant part: 
Section 6. INFORMATIONAL AND EDUCATIONAL [( I&E)] MEETINGS. 
[I&E meetings] may be held by the [HFFA] once every
calendar quarter, to be conducted by its duly recognized
officers and/or stewards and shall be open to all Employeesin [BU 11], including members and non-members of the [HFFA].The [HFD] or its representatives shall permit its Employeesto attend such meetings held during working hours and suchmeeting shall be limited to not more than two (2) hours.The [HFFA] shall give written notice to the [HFD] or itsrepresentative at least five (5) calendar days prior to thedate of the meetings. Such meetings shall be allowed atdates, times and places which do not interfere with thenormal operations of the respective Fire Departments. These meetings may include multiple sessions in order toaccommodate Employees in the bargaining unit. 
Section 6 meetings are vital to the function of the 
HFFA as the exclusive bargaining representative, and in the 
satisfaction of its statutory duty of fair representation pursuant to HRS § 89-8(a) (2012). Section 6 I&E meetings have been contained in the BU 11 Agreements since 1976, and the meetings have remained substantially unchanged since that time, up to and including the then current BU 11 Agreement. 
3 The Honorable James H. Ashford presided. 
-2-NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Historically, Section 6 I&E meetings have occurred in Fire 
Stations on an as requested basis with the expressed prior approval of Station Commanders/Captains and/or Battalion Chiefs, with notice to the appropriate Chief in accordance with Section 6 of the Agreement. 
On May 29, 2014, the HFFA, in accordance with Section 6 
of the Agreement, informed HFD Fire Chief Manuel Neves (Chief 
Neves) of its intent to conduct I&E meetings at HFD worksites between June 16, 2014, and June 15, 2015. By June 13, 2014, a 
dispute arose between the HFD and HFFA that culminated in a June 17, 2014 blanket prohibition by HFD against all HFFA station visitations. On June 18, 2014, pursuant to the HFD's blanket prohibition, two HFFA Oahu Executive Board members were asked to leave a previously scheduled Section I&E meeting. On June 20, 2014, Chief Neves attempted to unilaterally establish a process for the conduct of contractual I&E meetings by HFFA with its members. 
On August 27, 2014, HFFA filed with the Board the 
prohibited practice complaint for Case No. 14-CE-11-845 (2014 
Case), challenging the removal of HFFA Executive Board members from a pre-arranged and approved Section 6 I&E meeting, and Chief 
Neves's unilateral establishment of the process for the conduct of contractual I&E meetings. The 2014 Case was scheduled for hearing in December 2015, but was suspended for settlement discussions. The parties had not resolved all issues included in the 2014 Case by 2016. 
On August 16, 2016, Chief Neves informed HFFA in 
writing of his unilateral implementation of a prohibition of all 
-3-NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
station visits, including Section 6 I&E meetings, until after 
5:00 PM. Subsequently, Chief Neves allowed station visits to occur prior to 5:00 PM for non-bargaining unit agencies, but continued to prohibit BU 11 Section 6 I&E meetings until after 5:00 PM. As of August 16, 2016, it appears there had been no prior incidents of Section 6 I&E meetings interfering with the normal operations of the HFD. On November 14, 2016, HFFA filed with the Board the prohibited practice complaint for (Case No. 16-CE-11-887 (2016 Case), challenging the unilateral prohibition 
against HFFA Section 6 I&E meetings prior to 5:00 PM. 
On November 30, 2016, the Board entered Order No. 3212 
Order Consolidating Cases and Notice of Consolidated Hearing 
Dates and Deadlines (
Order No. 3212), granting the HFFA's motion 
to consolidate the 2014 and 2016 Cases. The Board found that the two cases involved the same parties and substantially the same issues, and that "consolidation of the two cases will be conducive to the proper dispatch of the Board's business, to the ends of justice, and will not unduly delay the proceedings nor prejudice the presentation of either case." 
The Board held the consolidated proceeding hearing in 
December 2016. On June 8, 2018, the Board entered Order No. 3368 Final Order Adopting HFFA/IAFF Proposed Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Decision and Order (Order No. 3368).  The 
Board concluded, inter alia, that: 
[The City's] implementation of changes to Section 6
[I&E] meetings or the imposition of a requirement that [I&E]
meetings only be held after 5:00 p.m. was a matter requiring[the HFD] to meet at reasonable times, to confer andnegotiate in good faith, with HFFA pursuant to Section89-9(a), HRS. 
-4-NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
[The City's] unilateral action changing or imposing
the requirement that [I&E] meetings only be held after 5:00
p.m. constitutes an unlawful refusal to bargain. 
[The City's] unilateral action changing or imposing
the requirement that [I&E] meetings only be held after 5:00p.m. deprived, and interfered with BU 11 employees, andtheir certified employee organization to [engage] in rightsguaranteed under chapter 89, HRS. 
. . . . 
Accordingly, the Board holds and concludes that HFD's
refusal to negotiate with the HFFA and acting unilaterally
regarding the requirement that [I&E] meetings be held after5:00 p.m., which is a mandatory subject of bargaining,constitutes a violation of HRS § 89-13(a)(1). 
. . . . 
The Board further concludes that based on the 
circumstances of this case showing that HFD permitted othervisitors, including VOYA, access to the fire station with orwithout prior notice and before 5:00 p.m., the requirementthat [I&E] meetings only be held after 5:00 p.m. wasselectively and discriminatorily applied to HFFA furtherconstituting a violation of HRS § 89-l3(a)(1). 
. . . . 
The Board further finds that the HFD's unilateral,
selective, and discriminatory denial of HFFA's access to thefire station before 5:00 p.m., constitutes a stifling of theemployee's free choice in violation of HRS § 89-l3(a)(2). 
. . . . 
Based on the totality of circumstances in this case,
the Board finds the actions of [the City] set forth herein,through their representatives, to be wilfull. 
The Board further finds and concludes that the actions 
complained of herein do not constitute a prohibited practiceunder HRS Section 89-13(a)(5), (7), or (8), because asalready determined in Order No. 3293, with respect to the
breach of collective bargaining agreement allegations
(Section 89-13(a)(8)), the HFFA was required to exhaustcontractual remedies before bringing the claim before theBoard; and the Board finds the remaining assertions(Sections 89-13(a)(5) and (a)(7)) redundant and superfluousto the Section 89-13(a)(1), (2) and (8) claims. 
The Board denies all other claims and allegations
brought by the HFFA in this consolidated proceeding. 
-5
- In footnote 11 of Order No. 3368, the Board stated, "In 
issuing Board Order No. 3212 in the consolidated cases . . . the 
Board finds in both cases the HFFA/IFFA was the prevailing party." The Board stated that it would address HFFA's request for attorneys' fees and costs in a separate order. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
The City appealed Order No. 3368 to the Circuit Court 
on July 9, 2018. Oral argument for the appeal was heard on 
June 14, 2019. During oral argument regarding the prevailing party issue, the Circuit Court stated in relevant part: 
However, as I continued to look through the order, I
see absolutely nothing in the conclusions of law that has
any tendency to establish that the City prevailed in any wayin the 2014 case. 
Yet the conclusions of law are replete with
conclusions that make perfectly clear that the board foundthe union to be the prevailing party in the 2016 case
concerning the 5 o'clock letter. 
Furthermore, the conclusions of law state, quote, The
board denies all other claims and allegations brought by the
HFFA in this consolidated proceeding, end quote, which tendsto indicate that all claims involving either the 2014 caseor the 2016 case which are not specifically resolved inOrder No. 3368 are denied. 
So in essence I see a lack of clarity. I do find that 
Order No. 3368 is unclear on this topic. From the languagein the order, I cannot tell if, Possibility A, the boardruled globally that the City violated Hawaii RevisedStatutes 89-13(a)(1) and (2) based on an amalgamation offacts and allegations from both cases or, Possibility No. 2,
in my view from the language of the order, is that instead
the board ruled separately that first the City violated(a)(1) and (a)(2), 89-13(a)(1) and (2), and in the 2014 casebased on facts pertaining only to the 2014 case, and thenseparately ruled in the 2016 case based on facts pertainingonly to the 2016 case. 
. . . . 
Therefore, cutting to the chase, on this topic at
least, the footnote on page 5 of Order No. 3368 is vacated.
Case is remanded for the board to make a clear and unambiguous statement whether the union prevailed on justthe 2016 case or on both the 2016 case and the 2014 case. 
That takes care of the first issue presented in my view. 
On August 12, 2019, the Circuit Court issued the Order 
Affirming in Part, Vacating in Part, and Remanding Order No. 3368 
(Order Remanding Order No. 3368), vacating footnote 11 of Order 
No. 3368, and affirming Order No. 3368 in all other respects. 
The Circuit Court remanded the case to the Board to "make a clear and unambiguous determination as to whether [HFFA] prevailed" in the consolidated cases.

-NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
On September 23, 2020, the Board issued Order No. 3658 
Order Clarifying Board Order No. 3368 on Remand (Order No. 3658). 
The Board inserted the Conclusion of Law below, following the 
final paragraph of page 12 of Order No. 3368: 
The consolidation of the cases allows the Board to consider 
the relevant facts and circumstances of the two cases together. The Board hereby finds that HFFA/IAFF is theprevailing party of the consolidated cases and thatHFFA/IAFF’s position as the prevailing party relies on theamalgamate of circumstances of the two cases, rather than onthe circumstances of either case individually. 
The City appealed Order No. 3658 to the Circuit Court. 
The Circuit Court affirmed. On the issue of whether the Board 
complied with the Order Remanding Order No. 3368, the Circuit Court stated: 
On the first issue, the Court determines that Order
No. 3658 is unambiguous. Board Order No. 3658 states that 
the Board determined that HFFA prevailed in the consolidatedcase, which the Board treated as an amalgamation of the 2014and 2016 cases. The Board in Order No. 3658 clarified that it treated those two cases under what the Court in the oral argument held June 14, 2019 . . . described as possibilityA. The Board clearly stated that it treated the 2014 and2016 cases as merged. 
Board Order No. 3658 does set out a conclusion of law. 
The Board states the new language being added to Order No.3368 is a conclusion of law and characterizes it as such. The Board inserted the new language into the conclusion oflaw section of Order No. 3368. The Court concludes the new language in Order No. 3658 being added to Order No. 3368 isin reality a conclusion of law. 
On the issue of whether the merger of the consolidated 
cases was erroneous, the Circuit Court concluded: 
On the second issue, the Court does not agree that the
Board's merger of the 2014 and 2016 cases was an error oflaw. Appellants argue Rule 42 of the Hawai #i Rules of Civil 
Procedures [( HRCP)] is controlling . . . . This argument is
misplaced. 
. . . . 
Rule 42 of the HRCP does not apply to consolidation in
an agency proceeding. The [HRCP] apply to the circuit
courts in civil matters. The Board in its Order No. 3212 consolidating the 2014 and 2016 cases ruled that it wasconsolidating the cases pursuant [to] Rule 12-42-8(g), andits various subparts of the 
Hawai #i Administrative Rules 
-7-NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
[(HAR)]. The Board was not applying Rule 42(a), HRCP, or
Hawai #i jurisprudence because the Board has its own rules. 
The Board has discretion to determine the scope of its
consolidation order and it did so in this case. . . . 
The City timely appealed. 
The City raises two points of error on appeal, 
contending that the Circuit Court committed reversible error in 
concluding that the HLRB was correct in holding that: (1) HFFA was the prevailing party in the 2014 Case for the purpose of attorneys' fees and costs, and (2) HFFA was the prevailing party in the consolidated 2014 Case and the 2016 Case based on an amalgamation of circumstances and effectively merging the consolidated cases. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve the City's points of error as follows: 
Because the question of whether the HLRB erred in 
determining that HFFA was the prevailing party in the 2014 Case depends on whether the 2014 and 2016 Cases may be considered as merged, we consider the City's second point of error first. 
The City argues that the Circuit Court and the Board 
erred in determining HFFA was the prevailing party in the consolidated cases based on an amalgamation of circumstances and the effective merger of the consolidated cases. The City contends that the Board failed to follow the Circuit Court's Order Remanding Order No. 3368 by failing to unambiguously determine whether HFFA was the prevailing party in the 2014 Case. 
HRS § 89-5(i)(4) (Supp. 2023) gives the Board the power 
to "[c]onduct proceedings on complaints of prohibited practices

- 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
by employers, employees, and employee organizations and take such 
actions with respect thereto as it deems necessary and proper." HAR Title 12, Chapter 42 sets forth the Board's Rules of Practice and Procedure under HRS Chapter 89.  HAR § 12-42-1. The Board 
in Order No. 3212 consolidated the 2014 and 2016 Cases pursuant to HAR § 12-42-8(g)(13).  
5 4
HAR § 12-42-8(g)(13) provided the Board the authority 
to consolidate proceedings "for hearings or other purposes" if it finds that such consolidation was "conducive to the proper dispatch of its business." (Emphasis added.) Regarding the meaning of the term "consolidation," the parties have argued about Professors Wright and Miller's explanation: 
In the context of legal procedure, "consolidation" is
used in three different senses:
 (1) When all except one of several actions are stayed
until one is tried, in which case the judgment in the one
trial is conclusive as to the others. This is not actuallya consolidation but sometimes is referred to as such.
 (2) When several actions are combined into one, lose
their separate identity, and become a single action in whicha single judgment is rendered. An illustration of this is 
the situation in which several actions are pending betweenthe same parties stating claims that might have been set outoriginally as separate counts in one complaint.
 (3) When several actions are ordered to be tried
together but each retains its separate character andrequires the entry of a separate judgment. This type ofconsolidation does not merge the suits into a single action,or cause the parties to one action to be parties to another. 
4 HAR Title 12 Chapter 42 has since been repealed. D EP'T LAB. & 
INDUS. REL., REPEAL OF CHAPTERS 12-41 AND 12-42 AND ADOPTION OF CHAPTER 12-43, HAR (eff.

5 HAR § 12-42-8(g)(13) provides: 
(13) The board, on its own initiative or upon motion, may
consolidate for hearing or other purposes or maycontemporaneously consider two or more proceedingswhich involve substantially the same parties or issuesif it finds that such consolidation of proceedings orcontemporaneous consideration will be conducive to theproper dispatch of its business and to the ends ofjustice and will not unduly delay the proceedings.

9A CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT & ARTHUR R. MILLER, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE 
§ 2382 (3d ed. 2024). The Hawai# i Supreme Court has stated that 
"our courts have apparently followed the interpretation adopted 
by the federal courts" that HRCP Rule 426 consolidation 
"provide[s] only for the third of these procedures." Cnty. of 
Haw. v. C & J Coupe Family Ltd. P'ship, 119 Hawai# i 352, 371, 198 
P.3d 615, 634 (2008). 
The City points to the supreme court's interpretation 
of HRCP Rule 42 to assert that the Board cannot adopt Wright and Miller's second interpretation to "merge" the constituent 2014 and 2016 Cases under HAR § 12-42-8(g) consolidation. However, as 
this court has previously stated: 
Court rules and related case law . . . do not govern agency
proceedings, except through the proper adoption of a rule oramendment authorized by law. See HRS §§ 91-3 & 91-9.
Reliance on case law interpreting court rules, as opposed tothe statutes, administrative rules, and cases directlyapplicable to an agency's proceedings may in some instanceslead to an improper procedure or an erroneous conclusion. 
Los Banos v. Haw. Labor Relations Bd., No. CAAP-17-0000476, 2019 
WL 6248555, at *15 (Haw. App. Nov. 22, 2019) (Mem. Op.). The Board's application of HAR § 12-42-8(g)(13) is not governed by case law interpreting HRCP Rule 42. See id. 
Furthermore, the Board's rules provided for a liberal 
construction to effect the purpose of HRS Chapter 89 and to 
6 HRCP Rule 42 is identical to its counterpart Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure Rule 42, with both providing in relevant part: 
Rule 42. CONSOLIDATION; SEPARATE TRIALS 
(a) Consolidation.  When actions involving a common
question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may
order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters inissue in the actions; it may order all the actionsconsolidated; and it may make such orders concerningproceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costsor delay. 
-10-NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
secure the just and speedy determination of every proceeding. 
HAR § 12-42-2. The Board's rules did not limit the scope of the Board's authority to consolidate proceedings. HAR § 12-42-8. Accordingly, we cannot say that the Board lacked the authority to merge cases under HAR § 12-42-8(g)(13) consolidation if it found that doing so "will be conducive to the proper dispatch of its business and to the ends of justice and will not unduly delay the proceedings." 
Here, in consolidating the 2014 and 2016 Cases, the 
Board expressly found that the cases involved the same parties and substantially the same issues, so that merging the cases was "conducive to the proper dispatch of the Board's business, to the ends of justice, and will not unduly delay the proceedings nor prejudice the presentation of either case." The Board later added that this amalgamation of circumstances and cases warranted a finding that HFFA was the prevailing party for the cases, as consolidated, rather than for either case individually. We conclude that the Board did not exceed its authority in determining the prevailing party of the consolidated cases based on the amalgamation of circumstances, i.e., based on the Board's decision to effectively merge the 2014 and 2016 Cases. Additionally, the Board in issuing Order No. 3658 did not fail to follow the Order Remanding Order No. 3368 because the Circuit Court directed the Board to clarify its treatment of the consolidated cases, and the Board clearly stated that it treated the cases as merged. 
Therefore, the Circuit Court did not err in affirming 
the Board's consideration of the consolidated cases as merged. 
-11-NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
In this light, we consider the City's argument that the 
Circuit Court erred in affirming the Board's conclusion that HFFA 
was the prevailing party with respect to attorneys' fees incurred in connection with the 2014 Case. The City contends that the Board must make an individual prevailing party determination for each case. The City points to the HLRB's dismissal of the specific claims raised in the 2014 Case. However, as discussed above, the Board permissibly merged the cases based on the commonality of the issues, as well as the parties, in the cases. 
HRS §§ 89-14 (2012)  and 377-9 (2015)  give the Board 
jurisdiction and the authority to award attorneys' fees in prohibited practice proceedings under certain circumstances. Regarding the determination of the prevailing party:

Here, the disputed main issue in the consolidated cases 
was whether the City committed a prohibited practice violation under HRS § 89-13 (2012)
9 by interfering with the HFFA's Section 
6 I&E meetings. The Board concluded that the City violated HRS §§ 89-13(a)(1) and (a)(2), but denied the HFFA's HRS §§ 89-13(a)(5), (7), or (8) claims as well as "all other claims and allegations brought by the HFFA in this consolidated proceeding." 
9 HRS § 89-13 provides in relevant part: 
§ 89-13. Prohibited practices; evidence of bad faith.
(a) It shall be a prohibited practice for a public employer
or its designated representative wilfully to:

(7) Refuse or fail to comply with any provision ofthis chapter; 
(8) Violate the terms of a collective bargainingagreement[.] 
-13-NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Although the HFFA did not prevail on all arguments for relief, 
the Board did not clearly err in determining that HFFA prevailed on the main disputed issue that the City's unilateral interference with the Section 6 I&E meetings was a prohibited practice. See Kaleikini
, 129 Hawai#i at 461, 304 P.3d at 259 
(holding that plaintiff failing to prevail on several counts did not change the outcome that they prevailed on the disputed main issue). Therefore, the Circuit Court did not err in concluding that the Board did not clearly err in finding and concluding that HFFA was the prevailing party in the consolidated 2014 and 2016 Cases. 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's May 11, 2021 
Order Affirming Order No. 3658 is affirmed.
