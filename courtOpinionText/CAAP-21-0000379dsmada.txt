APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 2CC191000040) 
ORDER GRANTING IN PART MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Nakasone and Fujise, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of the July 26, 2021 Motion to 
Dismiss Appeal (motion) by Defendant-Appellant Tara Boskoff 
Palmer (Appellant), the papers in support, and the record, it appears that Appellant requests her appeal be dismissed pursuant to a settlement with Plaintiff-Appellee First Hawaiian Bank on the condition that this court remand the case to the circuit court for further proceedings. 
"[T]he withdrawal [of an appeal] not only terminat[es] 
the appellate proceedings and restore[s] the lower court's jurisdiction . . . and operated instantly as a matter of law to vacate the appeal as far as the decree and rights of the parties were concerned precisely as though no appeal had been taken, there being an absence of statute to the contrary in this territory."  
Jay v. Jay 37 Haw. 34, 37 (Terr. 1944); see also, 
Solarana v. Indus. Elecs., Inc., 50 Haw. 22, 31, 428 P.2d 411, 417â€“18 (1967) quoting Jay ("Plaintiff's withdrawal of the prior NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appeal operated 'precisely as though no appeal had been 
taken.'").  There appears good cause to grant in part Appellant's motion to dismiss and an order of remand is denied as unnecessary. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the case is 
dismissed.  All other requested relief is denied. 
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, September 29, 2021.
