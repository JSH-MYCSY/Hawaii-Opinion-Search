APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1CC071001663)  
  
FEBRUARY 12, 2025 
  
HIRAOKA, PRESIDING JUDGE, NAKASONE AND MCCULLEN, JJ. 
 
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY MCCULLEN, J. 
The litigation in this case began almost eighteen 
years ago when Plaintiffs-Appellees/Cross-Appellants Richard 
Nelson III et al., beneficiaries of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act (HHCA), sued the Defendants-Appellees/Cross-
Appellees State of Hawai‘ i and its director of finance 
(collectively, State) and Defendants-Appellants/Cross-Appellees 
the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, the Hawaiian Homes Commission, and its commissioners (collectively, Department or DHHL). 
In their 2007 "First Amended Complaint for Declaratory 
Judgment and Injunctive Relief" (2007 First Amended Complaint), Plaintiffs claimed the State did not provide (Count 1), and DHHL 
did not request (Count 2), sufficient funding to support the 
HHCA's programs resulting in thousands of native Hawaiians waiting for promised homesteads. This case is now on appeal for

the third time following the selection of an inflation index and 
its application to the fiscal year (or FY) 2015-2016. 
We hold the Circuit Court of the First Circuit4 did not 
err in its selection and application of an inflation index. But 
we also hold the circuit court erred in entering judgment in 
favor of the State on Count 1 and in favor of DHHL on Count 2 of the 2007 First Amended Complaint based on its findings for fiscal year 2015-2016. 
I. BACKGROUND 
The background of this case was recounted in Nelson v. 
Hawaiian Homes Commission (Nelson I), 127 Hawai‘ i 185, 277 P.3d 
279, (2012); Nelson v. Hawaiian Homes Commission (Nelson II), 
130 Hawai‘ i 162, 307 P.3d 142 (2013); and Nelson v. Hawaiian 
Homes Commission (Nelson III), 141 Hawai‘ i 411, 412 P.3d 917 
(2018). 
We provide historical and procedural context as related 
to the issues currently on appeal. 
A. Historical Context 
Congress enacted the HHCA to protect and rehabilitate 
the "fast declining" native Hawaiian population. 59 Cong. Rec. 7448 (1920). 
By dedicating over 200,000 acres of former 
government and crown lands for a homesteading program, Congress 
hoped to "place the Hawaiian back on the soil" and thereby avert

judges presided over the previous remands.

"the entire disappearance of the Hawaiian race in the not 
distant future." 59 Cong. Rec. at 7448-7449, 7453; 1995 Haw. Spec. Sess. Laws Act 14, § 1 at 696. 
The HHCA was later incorporated into the state 
constitution as a condition of statehood. Admission Act, Pub. 
L. No. 86-3, 73 Stat. 4 (1959), reprinted in 1 Hawai‘i Revised 
Statutes at 135–36 (2009). 
Cognizant of DHHL's "
monumental and eternal dilemma in 
funding[,]" delegates to the 1978 Constitutional Convention (ConCon) introduced, and 
Hawai‘i voters ratified, an amendment 
requiring the legislature to "make sufficient sums available for 
. . . the administration and operating budget of the department 
of Hawaiian home lands[.]" Nelson I
, 127 Hawai‘i at 189, 198-99, 
277 P.3d at 283, 292-93 (some emphasis omitted; internal 
quotation marks omitted) quoting Debates in Committee of the Whole on Hawaiian Affairs, Comm. Prop. No. 11, in 2 
Proceedings 
of the Constitutional Convention of Hawai‘i of 1978 
(2 
Proceedings), at 410 (1980)). 
As a result, our state constitution now requires the 
legislature to "make sufficient funds available" for four specific purposes including, as relevant to this appeal, DHHL's administration and operating budget: 
4    
 
   
 
 
 
   
 
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The legislature shall make sufficient sums available for 
the following purposes: (1) development of home,
agriculture, farm and ranch lots; (2) home, agriculture, 
aquaculture, farm and ranch loans; (3) rehabilitationprojects to include, but not limited to, educational, economic, political, social and cultural processes by whichthe general welfare and conditions of native Hawaiians are
thereby improved; (4) the administration and operating
budget of the department of Hawaiian home lands; in 
furtherance of (1), (2), (3), and (4) herein, by appropriating the same in the manner provided by law. 
Haw. Const. art. XII, § 1 (emphases added); Nelson I, 127 Hawai‘ i 
at 189, 277 P.3d at 283. Our supreme court noted that despite 
this constitutional mandate, "the State has failed, by any reasonable measure, under the undisputed facts, to provide 
sufficient funding to DHHL[.]" Nelson I, 127 Hawai‘ i at 205, 277 
P.3d at 299. 
B. Proceedings Related to Nelson I 
1. The 2007 First Amended Complaint 
Plaintiffs' 2007 First Amended Complaint
5 sought 
"redress for the failure of this State and agencies of the State to live up to their solemn trust obligations pursuant to the 
[HHCA] and Article XII § 1 of the Hawai‘ i State Constitution." 
Count 1 claimed in part that DHHL "does not currently 
receive sufficient funds for . . . (4) the administration and 
operating budget of the [DHHL.]" (Emphasis added.) 
5 The 2007 First Amended Complaint included Counts 3 and 4, but the 
parties stipulated to dismiss Count 3 without prejudice and Count 4 with 
prejudice. 
5    
 
 
 
  
 
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Count 2, by realleging Count 1's allegations, claimed 
in part that the "state administration fails to annually request 
'sufficient sums' for the administration and operating budget of the [DHHL] to assure that . . . all programs of the department 
prescribed under Article XII, § 1 are adequately funded." 
(Emphasis added.) 
Plaintiffs sought a declaratory order, injunctive 
relief, appointment of a special master, attorneys' fees and costs, and other relief the circuit court deemed proper. 
The State moved for summary judgment arguing "[a]ny 
claim that the Hawai‘ i Legislature has an obligation under 
Article XII, Sections 1 & 2, of the [Hawai
‘i] Constitution to 
provide a certain level of money to DHHL is barred by the Political Question Doctrine."
6 (Formatting altered.) The 
circuit court granted the State's motion. 
Plaintiffs appealed. 
2. Intermediate Court of Appeals' (ICA) Decision (2011) In order to decide "whether the 1978 constitutional 
amendment requiring sufficient funding of DHHL [was] a political question," this court applied the six-factor test in Trustees of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs v. Yamasaki, 69 Haw. 154, 737 
6 The political question "doctrine is the result of the balance courts 
must strike in preserving separation of powers yet providing a check upon the 
other two branches of government." Nelson I
, 127 Hawai‘i at 194, 277 P.3d at 
288.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
P.2d 446 (1987), "to the intent of the delegates to the 1978 
Constitutional Convention." Nelson v. Hawaiian Homes Comm'n
(Nelson), 124 Hawai‘ i 437, 442, 444, 246 P.3d 369, 374, 376 
(App. 2011). 
Ultimately, this court concluded that none of the six 
factors indicating a political question were present and the "question of the legislature making sufficient sums available to 
the DHHL is justiciable and therefore not a political question." 
Id. at 447, 246 P.3d at 379. 
This court then vacated the circuit court's final 
judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings. Id.
The State filed an application for a writ of 
certiorari. 
3. Nelson I (2012) - Hawai‘ i Supreme Court's Decision 
Regarding the Political Question Doctrine On certiorari, the supreme court affirmed this court's 
judgment but only as to "what constitutes 'sufficient sums' for DHHL's administrative and operating expenses[,]" not the other 
three purposes. Nelson I
, 127 Hawai‘i at 188, 206, 277 P.3d at 
282, 300. In particular, the supreme court recounted the 
delegates' detailed explanations "as to how administrative and 
operating costs were allocated" and concluded that, "by the end 
of the Committee on the Whole Debates, what was certain was that the $1.3 to $1.6 [million] figure represented 'sufficient sums' 
7    
 
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
for administrative and operating expenses only." Nelson I, 127 
Hawai‘i at 200, 202–03, 277 P.3d at 294, 296–97. 
As a result, the supreme court held that "the 1978 
Constitutional Convention history does provide judicially 
discoverable and manageable standards that do not involve initial policy determinations of a kind clearly for nonjudicial 
discretion." Nelson I, 127 Hawai‘ i at 203, 277 P.3d at 297. "At 
a minimum, funding at or above the $1.3 to $1.6 million 
envisioned in 1978 would be required." Id.(footnote omitted). 
But, the court explained, "this figure could be adjusted to 
reflect the impact of factors such as inflation or increased 
collective bargaining costs, both of which were acknowledged by [a delegate] as factors that could appropriately be taken into account in determining the required contribution." Nelson I, 
127 Hawai‘ i at 203 n.8, 277 P.3d at 297 n.8 (emphasis added). 
In short, the supreme court affirmed this court's 
judgment (which vacated the circuit court's judgment) "but only on the narrower ground that the determination of what constitutes 'sufficient sums' for administrative and operating 
expenses under the Hawai‘ i Constitution's Article XII, Section 1 
[(adopting the HHCA)] is justiciable and not barred as a political question." Nelson I
, 127 Hawai‘i at 206, 277 P.3d at 
300.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In a footnote, the supreme court explained that only 
Count 1 of the 2007 First Amended Complaint was at issue because 
DHHL did not apply for a writ of certiorari as to Count 2. 
Nelson I, 127 Hawai‘ i at 191 n.4, 277 P.3d at 285 n.4. "As a 
practical matter, however, the ICA's judgment vacated the entire 
circuit court judgment and remanded the entire case for a decision on the merits, which reopened all the Counts." Id.
C. Nelson II
 (2013) - Hawai‘i Supreme Court's Decision 
Regarding Attorneys' Fees and Costs 
Briefly, in 
Nelson II, the supreme court considered 
whether Plaintiffs were entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to the private attorney general doctrine as 
they prevailed in Nelson I. Nelson II
, 130 Hawai‘i at 165, 307 
P.3d at 145. Although the supreme court denied the request for 
attorneys' fees (without prejudice), the supreme court clarified that Plaintiffs prevailed in 
Nelson I because their claim(s) 
against the State survived. Nelson II

1. On Remand to Circuit Court (2014-2016) On remand, the circuit court held a bench trial on 
Counts 1 and 2 of the 2007 First Amended Complaint. The circuit court heard testimony from nine witnesses and received 239 exhibits into evidence.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In its November 27, 2015 Findings of Fact, Conclusions 
of Law, and Order, the circuit court found that the State 
appropriated less funds than requested: 
In each fiscal year since 1992, the State has 
appropriated to DHHL less in general funds than what DHHL
requested to be appropriated for its administrative and operating costs:  
Amount Amount of General 
Funds 
Requested: Appropriated:

2015-16: 28,478,966 9,632,000 
And "between and including fiscal years 1992 and 2013," DHHL's 
"own funding requests to the legislature were for less than DHHL 
determined that it needed." The circuit court also found that "[s]ince 1978, the legislature has not appropriated enough general funds to pay for DHHL's administrative and operating expense[s]." 
10    
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The circuit court then contemplated "DHHL's actual 
administrative and operating budget expenses" and DHHL's 
projections for then-current fiscal year 2015-2016. In total, the court determined DHHL needed more than $28 million for its 
fiscal year 2015-2016 administrative and operating budget. 
In its "Order Amending Order Issued November 27, 
2015[,]" the circuit court determined that "the amount of 
general funds appropriated to DHHL for its administrative and operating budget for fiscal year 2015-16 ($9,632,000) [was] not sufficient." 
The circuit court entered the May 31, 2016 First 
Amended Final Judgment in favor of Plaintiffs and against the 
State as to Count 1 and in favor of Plaintiffs and against DHHL 
as to Count 2. 
The State appealed, and Plaintiffs cross-appealed. 
DHHL applied for transfer to the supreme court, which was accepted.  
2. Nelson III (2018) - Hawai‘ i Supreme Court's Decision 
Regarding Actual Needs 
The supreme court vacated the circuit court's decision 
because it exceeded Nelson I's mandate by determining DHHL's 
actual need for its administrative and operating expenses. 
Nelson III, 141 Hawai‘ i at 413, 412 P.3d at 919. 
11    
 
 
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
More specifically, the supreme court held "the circuit 
court erred by engaging in a comprehensive inquiry into the 
amount DHHL actually needed for its administrative and operating 
expenses." 
Nelson III, 141 Hawai‘i at 412, 412 P.3d at 918. 
Rather, "[u]nder Nelson I, the only judicially discoverable and 
manageable standard for determining 'sufficient sums' for DHHL's administrative and operating budget was established by the 
delegates of the 1978 Constitutional Convention as $1.3 to 1.6 
million, adjusted for inflation." Id. (citation omitted). 
The supreme court announced in three different places 
in its opinion that it vacated the circuit court's judgments and underlying orders and remanded the case for further proceedings and to determine sufficient sums for fiscal year 2015-2016: 
•
 "we vacate the circuit court's First Amended 
Final Judgment, Final Judgment, and underlying 
orders, and remand this case to the circuit 
court to determine the current value of $1.3 to 
1.6 million (in 1978 dollars), adjusted for inflation[,]" Id. at 413, 412 P.3d at 919; 
• "we vacate the circuit court's First Amended Final Judgment, Final Judgment, and underlying orders. This case is remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings. On remand, the circuit court shall determine whether the State Defendants have provided 'sufficient sums' for DHHL's administrative and operating budget 
using the only judicially discoverable and 
12    
 
 
 
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
manageable standard identified in Nelson I: 
the 1978 baseline of $1.3 to 1.6 million, adjusted for inflation[,]" Id. at 422, 412 P.3d at 928; and 
• "the circuit court's First Amended Final 
Judgment, Final Judgment, and underlying orders 
are vacated, and this case is remanded to the 
circuit court to determine whether the State 
Defendants have provided 'sufficient sums' for DHHL's administrative and operating budget for the 2015-2016 fiscal year using the only judicially discoverable and manageable standard identified in Nelson I: the 1978 baseline of $1.3 to 1.6 million, adjusted for inflation." 
Id. 
The supreme court then entered its judgment, vacating 
the circuit court's judgments and underlying order and remanding 
the case for further proceedings consistent with its opinion: 
• "the Circuit Court of the First Circuit's 
('circuit court') First Amended Final Judgment, 
Final Judgment, and underlying order are 
vacated, and the case is remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with the opinion." 
E. Proceedings Related to This Appeal 
1. Pre-Hearing Motions On remand to the circuit court, the State moved for 
summary judgment, which the circuit court denied. DHHL moved to 
13    
 
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
set the inflation rate at eight percent annually, or 
alternatively, to hold an evidentiary hearing; the circuit court granted DHHL's motion to the extent it requested an evidentiary hearing. 
And Plaintiffs moved the court for "a final 
determination to resolve count 1 of [P]laintiffs' Complaint filed in 2007." Plaintiffs reiterated that their 2007 First Amended Complaint "did not ask for a determination as to exactly how much money would be sufficient for the Department[.]" Instead, they "specifically asked for 'a Declaratory Order that 
. . . [t]he State of Hawai‘ i has failed to provide sufficient 
funds to the Department . . . in violation of [its] 
constitutional duty to do so[.]" (Emphasis omitted.) 
The circuit court denied Plaintiffs' motion for a 
determination as to Count 1. The circuit court explained it 
understood Plaintiffs' "argument that Count 1 was never about a 
single year and [that] this court should therefore determine and add up amounts for the administrative and operating budgets for all the years at issue and find that Plaintiffs prevailed[.]" The circuit court, however, noted "the remand order specifically direct[ed] [it] to determine the administrative and operating budget for the 2015-2016 fiscal year by using the 1978 baseline of $1.3 to $1.6 million, adjusted for inflation." The court 
explained it was "first [going to] follow the remand order[,]" 
14    
 
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and the "form of any Final Judgment issued by [the] court 
[would] be determined at the end of the remanded proceedings[.]" 
2. Evidentiary Hearing The evidentiary hearing focused on the inflation index 
the circuit court should apply to adjust $1.3 to $1.6 million in 1978 dollars to 2015-2016 dollars. 
Two threshold matters shaped the court's analysis. 
First, the court distinguished "between inflation (price changes over time for the same or similar goods and services) versus growth of costs (adding services and employees over time increases the budget baseline, which in turn changes over time due to inflation)." Because the court understood Nelson III's 
instruction as precluding "any evidence of cost increases above 
the 1978 baseline(s) resulting from growth as opposed to inflation[,]" it "focused on determining inflation based on the same or similar costs, and not determining inflation to include growth of goods and services." 
Second, the court declined to "determine what 
inflation rate or index the ConCon estimated and applied in 1978 and then apply it for the period 1978 to [fiscal year] 2016." 
Although "the court agree[d] there is reason to believe the 
ConCon was referring to the [Consumer Price Index or] CPI[,]" it noted "the remand order does not require that only the CPI be used to adjust for inflation from 1978 to FY 2016." Instead, 
15    
 
 
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the court interpreted its task as "a fact-based economics and 
math exercise" in which it was to "make a factual determination of what a 1978 budget actually costs in 2016 due to inflation" using the best available tool. It said it was "not aware of any 
applicable law precluding it from using all available and 
admissible evidence to solve this exercise as accurately as possible." 
Over two days, the circuit court heard testimony from 
three expert witnesses "in the field of economics, including how to adjust for inflation." Although the experts generally agreed "adjusting for inflation involves tracking changes in prices over time[,]" they each testified to "different ways to adjust 
for inflation." 
First, the State's expert testified the U.S. 
Department of Labor's Consumer Price Index was the best method 
to adjust the 1978 baseline for inflation because it "is the most widely used method to track inflation, particularly for economic analysis and policy-making." The CPI "measures changes in the prices of goods and services for consumers: namely, goods and services bought and consumed by individuals, families, and 
households." (Emphasis omitted.) The Honolulu CPI, for 
example, tracks "categories includ[ing] food, cars, gas, housing, furniture, medical costs, education, travel, electricity, and other consumer-oriented items." Moreover, the 
16    
 
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
State inferred that the "excerpts from the 1978 Constitutional 
Convention which referred to an 8% inflation" may have been referring to the CPI because eight percent was "approximately the inflation rate per the CPI then." 
Next, the Department's expert testified the court 
should apply the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Employment Cost Index for State and Local Government (ECI) because it "tracks the compensation of state and local government employees over time" and DHHL's largest expense continues to be "personnel costs, including salaries and fringe benefits." 
Last, Plaintiffs' expert testified the court should 
apply the State and Local Government Consumption Expenditures 
Price Index (SLGC) which "tracks price changes for government 
goods and services and specifically adjusts for increased costs due to government growth" by separating "out these quantitative effects of the increase in the size of government from any price effects." "Unlike the ECI, the SLGC also includes moneys that state and local governments spend for office equipment, materials, supplies, and services, including salaries." 
3. Findings and Conclusions 
In its December 18, 2020 Findings of Fact, Conclusions 
of Law, and Order, the circuit court found the SLGC was the 
"better tool" to measure inflation. The court explained that "the SLGC [was] better than a CPI (both U.S. and Honolulu) 
17    
 
 
 
 
  
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
because . . . the two CPI indexes focus on consumer costs, which 
simply do not reflect the costs of government agencies." It also found "the SLGC [was] better than ECI, which [was] limited to employee salaries and benefits." 
Applying the SLGC index for inflation, the court 
adopted $5,810,065.00 and $7,150,850.00 in fiscal year 2015-2016 dollars as the adjusted amounts for the 1978 baseline of $1.3 and $1.6 million, respectively. 
It then found there was "no dispute that the 
Legislature appropriated over $17 million in general funds for DHHL's administrative and operating budget for fiscal year 2016[.]" In fact, the "actual appropriation of over $17 million 
exceeds by far every expert opinion offered post-remand[.]" "No 
matter which inflation index this court may have selected from the experts and evidence presented, a single conclusion is required: 'sufficient sums' were provided."
7 
The court thus determined "that by appropriating over 
$17 million for FY 2016, the State Defendants provided 'sufficient sums' for DHHL's administrative and operating budget for the 2015-2016 fiscal year[.]" 
7 We note the parties do not appeal from the circuit court's 
determination that sufficient sums were provided for fiscal year 2015- 2016.

4. Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment 
Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment as to Count 1, 
arguing they were "entitled to summary judgment and a 
declaratory order that the State of Hawai‘i failed to provide 
sufficient funds to the [DHHL] in violation of its 
constitutional duty to do so pursuant to Article XII § 1 [(adopting the HHCA)] of the state constitution." Plaintiffs 
argued that "Count 1 was never confined to any one particular 
year" and "certainly not to fiscal year 2016." Plaintiffs pointed out that "[w]ithout even considering inflation, it is obvious that the legislature failed to provide the [DHHL] with sufficient sums in fiscal years 2000-2013." 
5. Final Judgment As to Count 1 of the 2007 First Amended Complaint, the 
circuit court entered judgment in favor of the State and against 
Plaintiffs based on its findings for fiscal year 2015-2016. 
As to Count 2 of the 2007 First Amended Complaint, the 
circuit court entered judgment in favor of DHHL and against 
Plaintiffs based on its findings for fiscal year 2015-2016. 
The circuit court elaborated on its judgment regarding 
Counts 1 and 2 in its "Analysis and Conclusions Regarding Entry of Final Judgment[.]" 
(Formatting altered.) As relevant to 
this appeal, the court explained "[t]he only remaining issue in 
this court's view [is] the prior years, before FY 2015-2016. On 
19    
 
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that issue, [the] court will practice strict abeyance to what it 
concludes is the express limit of the remand instructions --determine sufficient sums for one year, FY 2015-2016." 
Then, in a minute order, the circuit court removed 
Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment from the calendar because it was "moot in light of the Final Judgment entered 5/25/21. Although the [motion] was filed before the Final Judgment was entered, the court conclude[d] the issues presented were fully aired in the previous filings and arguments[.]" (Formatting altered.) 
DHHL appealed, and Plaintiffs cross-appealed. The 
parties did not apply to transfer this case to the supreme 
court. 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
Appellate courts review findings of fact under the 
clearly erroneous standard and conclusions of law under the 
right/wrong standard.  Kalima v. State, 148 Hawai‘ i 129, 143, 468

Hawai‘i 148, 165, 449 
P.3d 1146, 1163 (2019). But conclusions of law presenting mixed 
questions of fact and law are reviewed "under the clearly erroneous standard because the court's conclusions are dependent upon the facts and circumstances of each individual case." Chun

III. DISCUSSION 
On appeal, DHHL challenges the circuit court's 
selection and application of the SLGC inflation index.8 Both 
DHHL and Plaintiffs challenge the circuit court's judgment in 
favor of the State on Count 1. Plaintiffs additionally 
challenge the circuit court's judgment in favor of DHHL on Count 2.
9 Again, the circuit court did not err in selecting and 
applying the SLGC index, but erred in entering judgment in favor of the State on Count 1 and DHHL on Count 2 as pled in the 2007 First Amended Complaint. 
8 DHHL also challenges the circuit court's failure to provide a 
prospective method of calculating inflation. DHHL fails to point to where in
the record it brought this issue to the circuit court's attention and, thus, this challenge is waived. See HRAP Rule 28(b)(4). 
Even if this challenge was not waived, the 2007 First Amended Complaint
did not request, and the prior appellate dispositions did not direct, that 
the circuit court set an inflation index for prospective use. Nelson

Hawai‘i at 447, 246 P.3d at 379;

, 141 
Hawai‘i at 422, 412 P.3d at 928. Thus, we cannot say that the circuit court 
erred when it did not identify a particular inflation index to be used prospectively. 
9 Plaintiffs also challenge the circuit court's " effective[] den[ial]" 
of their motion for summary judgment. Based on our decision, we need not reach this issue.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
A. The Circuit Court Did Not Err in Selecting and Applying the 
SLGC Index 
On appeal, DHHL contends "the [c]ircuit [c]ourt erred 
in concluding that the best inflation rate was the SLGC, 
disregarding the words of the delegates at the 1978 
Constitutional Convention and the legislature's authorization 
for positions at the DHHL."10 "Instead, the [c]ircuit [c]ourt 
should have adopted the 8-percent inflation rate set by the Delegates at the Debates or adopted the ECI and taken into account the increase in DHHL's staff size." 
DHHL relies on the following excerpt from the debate 
to support its argument: 
"From [the $1.3 million] budget, $750,000 goes 
toward staff salaries for 66 percent of the staff. Even this figure will rise as this portion of the staff is civil service and subject to an 8-percent annual inflation rate." 
10 Appearing to challenge DHHL's standing, the State argues DHHL's 
appeal should be dismissed as it "is confusingly attempting to appeal from 
the judgment that the circuit court entered against Plaintiffs below" and
that "[t]here is no legitimate legal basis for DHHL's appeal because DHHL is
not a 'party aggrieved' by the judgment of a circuit court." 
An aggrieved party is " one who is affected or prejudiced by the 
appealable order." Leone v. Cnty. of Maui
, 141 Hawai‘i 68, 89, 404 P.3d 1257, 
1278 (2017) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). 
The circuit court's selection of an inflation index 
affects the 
calculation of sufficient sums and, thus, affects DHHL's administrative and 
operating budget. Montalvo v. Chang, 64 Haw. 345, 351, 641 P.2d 1321, 1326 
(1982) (holding that, although the orders did not subject the State to further liability, the State was aggrieved "since its interests may well bejeopardized if the fees in question were improper") (overruled on other 
grounds by 
Chun v. Bd. of Trs. of Emps.' Ret. Sys. of State of Hawai‘i, 
92 
Hawaiʻi 432, 992 P.2 d 127 (2000)). We therefore address DHHL's point of 
error. 
22    
 
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Debates in the Committee of the Whole on Hawaiian Affairs Comm. 
Prop. No. 11, in 2 Proceedings, at 414. 
This excerpt does not support the proposition that the 
delegates set an inflation rate at eight percent for the entire administrative and operating budget. The "8-percent annual inflation rate" referenced only a portion of the $1.3 million budget - the civil servant salaries. And the debates did not explain why civil servant salaries would be subject to an eight 
percent annual increase – by, for example, citing to a 
collective bargaining agreement – or tether the eight percent to any identifiable index. 
In the alternative, DHHL contends that, "[i]f the 
[c]ircuit [c]ourt did not err in refusing to adopt the 8-percent inflation rate discussed in the Debates," the court should have applied the ECI. 
Because "[t]here is no universally agreed formula to 
apply to all inflation adjustments[,]" the circuit court reviewed each proposed inflation adjustment method and made "findings as to which method the court decided to apply in this case, and why." The circuit court found that the SLGC index was the "better tool" to adjust for inflation because it "tracks how the average price of goods, services, and labor purchased by a government agency changes" and "tracks inflation for a 
23    
 
 
   
 
  
 
 
  
   
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
government agency's major costs of employee salaries and 
benefits as well as other government agency administrative and operating costs." (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Substantial evidence in the form of expert witness testimony 
supports the circuit court's finding. See Leslie v. Est. of
Tavares, 91 Hawai‘ i 394, 399, 984 P.2d 1220, 1225 (1999) 
(explaining findings are "clearly erroneous when 'the record lacks substantial evidence to support the finding'" (citations 
omitted)). 
Thus, the circuit court's finding that the SLGC was a 
"better tool" than the ECI or CPI to adjust the 1978 budget baselines for inflation was not clearly erroneous, and the circuit court did not err in selecting and applying the SLGC inflation index. B. The Circuit Court Erred by Not Resolving Counts 1 and 2 as 
Pled in the 2007 First Amended Complaint 
Next, Plaintiffs and DHHL challenge the circuit 
court's entry of judgment on Count 1 of the 2007 First Amended 
Complaint in favor of the State and against Plaintiffs based on its fiscal year 2015-2016 findings.
11 Plaintiffs additionally 
11 The State again appears to challenge DHHL's standing to appeal,
arguing that "DHHL appears to be improperly stepping into Plaintiffs' shoes" 
and that "DHHL is a stranger to Count 1 -there are no claims against DHHL
under Count 1[.]" 
Count 1 required a determination as to whether the State provided
sufficient sums to DHHL, which affects DHHL's administrative and operating 
budget.  See supra note 10 and accompanying text. In any event, Plaintiffs
raise the same issue. 
24    
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
challenge the circuit court's judgment in favor of DHHL on 
Count 2. 
To resolve these challenges, we must first interpret 
Nelson III's instructions to the circuit court. 
1. Nelson III's Instructions "When a reviewing court remands a matter with specific 
instructions, the trial court is powerless to undertake any proceedings beyond those specified therein." Standard Mgmt.,
Inc. v. Kekona, 99 Hawai‘ i 125, 137, 53 P.3d 264, 276 (App. 2001) 
(citation omitted). But "[t]he 'true intent and meaning' of a reviewing court's mandate is not to be found in a solitary word or decontextualized phrase, but rather in the opinion, as a whole, read in conjunction with the judgment and interpreted in light of the case's procedural history and context." In re
Hawai‘i
 Elec. Light Co., 149 Hawaiʻ i 239, 241, 487 P.3d 708, 710 
(2021). 
In Nelson III, the Hawai‘ i Supreme Court vacated the 
circuit court's judgments and underlying orders, reopening Counts 1 and 2 of the 2007 First Amended Complaint. Nelson III, 
141 Hawai‘ i at 422, 412 P.3d at 928; see Nelson I, 127 Hawai‘ i at 
191 n.4, 277 P.3d at 285 n.4 (explaining that, although the circuit court's decision as to Count 2 was not appealed, the ICA "remanded the entire case for a decision on the merits, which reopened all the Counts"). 
25    
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In addition, the supreme court remanded the case to 
the circuit court "for further proceedings" and "to determine 
whether the State Defendants have provided 'sufficient sums' for DHHL's administrative and operating budget for the 2015-2016 
fiscal year using the only judicially discoverable and 
manageable standard identified in Nelson I: the 1978 baseline of $1.3 to 1.6 million, adjusted for inflation." Nelson III, 141 
Hawai‘i at 422, 412 P.3d at 928. 
Based on Nelson III's opinion and judgment and this 
case's procedural history, the circuit court's task was twofold -
it was required to (1) determine the sufficient sums question 
for fiscal year 2015-2016 and (2) resolve Counts 1 and 2 of the 
2007 First Amended Complaint. Nelson III, 141 Hawai‘ i at 422, 
412 P.3d at 928; see Nelson I, 127 
Hawai‘i at 191 n.4, 277 P.3d 
at 285 n.4. To interpret Nelson III otherwise would leave 
undecided Plaintiff's claims as pled in the 2007 First Amended Complaint. 
Thus, the circuit court erred by narrowly interpreting 
Nelson III's mandate. 
Because Counts 1 and 2 were reopened, we look at the 
2007 First Amended Complaint to determine the scope of 
Plaintiffs' claims. 
"Hawaii's rules of notice pleading require that a 
complaint set forth a short and plain statement of the claim 
26    
 
 
 
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that provides defendant with fair notice of what the plaintiff's 
claim is and the grounds upon which the claim rests. Pleadings must be construed liberally." Adams v. Dole Food Co., 132 
Hawaiʻi 478, 488, 323 P.3d 122, 132 (App. 2014) (cleaned up). 
To satisfy Hawai‘ i Rule[s] of Civil Procedure [Rule] 
8(a)(1), "the complaint must contain either direct 
allegations on every material point necessary to sustain a 
recovery on any legal theory, even though it may not be the 
theory suggested or intended by the pleader, or containallegations from which an inference fairly may be drawn that evidence on these material points will be introduced
at trial." 
Kawakami v. Kahala Hotel Invs., LLC, 142 Hawaiʻ i 507, 517, 421 
P.3d 1277, 1287 (2018) (cleaned up). 
2. Resolution of Count 1 
Count 1 of the 2007 First Amended Complaint alleged 
the State violated its constitutional duty to sufficiently fund DHHL. Although Count 1 broadly addressed all of HHCA's 
purposes, the supreme court in Nelson I narrowed the scope of 
what the circuit court could address to DHHL's administrative 
and operating expenses. 127 Hawai‘ i at 203, 206, 277 P.3d at 
297, 300. 
Though Plaintiffs argue their 2007 First Amended 
Complaint "was not focused on a single fiscal year[,]" Count 1 
alleged that DHHL "does not currently receive sufficient funds for . . . the administration and operating budget[.]" (Some emphasis added.) Even when liberally construing the complaint and considering the factual allegations raised, Count 1's use of 
27    
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"currently" indicates reference to the year the First Amended 
Complaint was filed - 2007, which could encompass fiscal years 
2006-2007 and 2007-2008. See Adams
, 132 Hawaiʻi at 488-89, 323 
P.3d at 132-33 (explaining all pleadings must be "construed 
liberally" so "as to do substantial justice" (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)). 
Here, the circuit court entered its May 25, 2021 Final 
Judgment in favor of the State and against Plaintiffs on Count 1 of the 2007 First Amended Complaint based on its finding of sufficient sums in fiscal year 2015-2016. 
The circuit court 
made no findings regarding the amounts the legislature allocated to DHHL's administrative and operating budget as related to 2007. The circuit court also made no findings as to the value of $1.3 and $1.6 million 1978 dollars adjusted for inflation to 2007 dollars. Absent these findings, the circuit court could 
not render a judgment on Count 1 as pled in the 2007 First 
Amended Complaint. 
Thus, the circuit court erred in entering judgment in 
favor of the State and against Plaintiffs on Count 1 of the 2007 First Amended Complaint by relying on its findings for fiscal year 2015-2016. 
3. Resolution of Count 2 Count 2 of the 2007 First Amended Complaint realleged 
and incorporated all allegations preceding it, which included an 
28    
 
 
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
allegation that the State "administration fails to annually 
request 'sufficient sums' for the administration and operating budget of the [DHHL] to assure that . . . all programs of the department prescribed under Article XII, § 1 are adequately 
funded." (Emphasis added.) 
The circuit court made no findings regarding the 
amount of funding DHHL requested annually for its administrative 
and operating budget prior to the filing of the 2007 First Amended Complaint (or for fiscal year 2015-2016). Without findings as to the amount of funding DHHL requested, the circuit court could not render judgment on Count 2 as pled in the 2007 First Amended Complaint. 
Thus, the circuit court erred in entering judgment in 
favor of DHHL and against Plaintiffs on Count 2 of the 2007 First Amended Complaint by relying on its findings for fiscal year 2015-2016. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
Based on the foregoing, to the extent the circuit 
court made determinations regarding Counts 1 and 2 of the 2007 First Amended Complaint based solely on its fiscal year 2015-
2016 findings, we vacate those portions of the circuit court's 
May 25, 2021 Final Judgment and December 18, 2020 Findings of
