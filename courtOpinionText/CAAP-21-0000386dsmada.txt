APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Hiraoka and Fujise, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of the July 16, 2021 "Motion to 
Dismiss Defendants-Appellants Yang Suh, Greene Lane Capital LLC, 
Yang D. Suh and Mari Ikeguchi, Trustees of the Yang D. Suh and Mari Ikeguchi Living Trust, Dated March 14, 2019, and Greene Lane NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Capitol Market LLC's [(collectively, Appellants)] Appeal from the 
Order Granting Ex Parte Motion for the Appointment of a Receiver 
Pendente Lite [(Receiver)], Filed May 17, 2021, Filed May 25, 
2021 [(Order Appointing Receiver)] for Lack of Appellate 
Jurisdiction," it appears we lack jurisdiction over the appeal 
because the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit court) 
has not entered a final, appealable judgment in the underlying 
case, Civil No. 1CCV-21-0000296, and the interlocutory Order Appointing Receiver is not independently appealable. 
An aggrieved party cannot obtain appellate review of a 
circuit court's interlocutory orders in a civil case, under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-1(a) (2016), until the 
circuit court has reduced its dispositive rulings to an 
appealable, final judgment under Rule 58 or Rule 54(b) of the Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure.  See Jenkins v. Cades Schutte 
Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai# i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 
(1994).  The circuit court has not yet entered a final, appealable judgment in the underlying case, Civil No. 1CCV-21-0000296. 
The Order Appointing Receiver does not qualify for an 
exception to the final-judgment requirement under the collateral-order doctrine because Appellants may seek review of the Order Appointing Receiver, and any other orders related to the appointment of the Receiver, once the circuit court enters a final, appealable judgment, and Appellants fail to demonstrate that the Receiver's actions pending resolution of the underlying case may cause them to suffer an irreparable loss of rights.  See Greer v. Baker, 137 Hawai# i 249, 253, 255, 369 P.3d 832, 836, 838 
(2016) (setting forth requirements for appeal under the collateral-order doctrine).  
Further, it appears the Order Appointing Receiver is 
not appealable under the Forgay doctrine because it does not order the Receiver to sell or otherwise divest Appellants of their interest in the subject partnership.  See Greer, 137 Hawai# i at 253, 369 P.3d at 836 (setting forth requirements for 
appeal under the Forgay doctrine).  Also, it appears the Order Appointing Receiver is not appealable under HRS ยง 641-1(b) 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
because it is not HRS ยง 641-1(b)-certified, and it does not 
appear that Appellants sought certification.  See HRS ยง 641-1(b) (2016). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion to 
dismiss the appeal is granted and the appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
