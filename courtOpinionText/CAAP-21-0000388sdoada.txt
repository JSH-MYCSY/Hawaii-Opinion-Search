APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By:  Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.)  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
These consolidated secondary appeals arise from primary 
appeals to the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit.1  The primary 
appeals were taken from a decision made by the Director of 
Appellee-Appellee State of Hawai# i Department of Health (DOH). 
The Director decided that "a new or supplemental environmental 
review is not required" by the Hawai# i Environmental Policy Act, 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) Chapter 343 (HEPA) in connection 
with Appellee-Appellee Puna Geothermal Venture's application for 
renewal of its noncovered source permit under HRS Chapter 342B 
("Air Pollution Control").  The circuit court dismissed both primary appeals, concluding that it lacked jurisdiction to review the Director's decision under HRS Chapter 91, the Hawai# i 
Administrative Procedure Act (HAPA). 
The issue presented by these secondary appeals is 
whether the Director's HEPA decision was made in a contested case proceeding subject to HAPA.  For the reasons explained below, we conclude it was not.  We affirm: 
(1) the Judgment in favor of DOH 
and Puna Geothermal and against Appellants-Appellants Puna Pono 
Alliance, Luana Jones, Shana Ritsema, and Jon Olson 
(collectively, the Alliance) entered by the circuit court on 
June 23, 2021, in 3CCV-20-0000390; and (2) the "Amended Judgment 
on Appeal" in favor of DOH and Puna Geothermal and against self-
represented Appellant-Appellant Sara Steiner entered by the 
circuit court on December 16, 2021, in 3CCV-20-0000398. 
Proceedings in the DOH 
On December 15, 2009, DOH issued noncovered source 
permit No. 0008-02-N (the 
Permit) to Puna Geothermal.  The Permit 
was issued in accordance with HRS Chapter 342B ("Air Pollution 
Control") and Hawai# i Administrative Rules (HAR), Title 11, 
1 The Honorable Henry T. Nakamoto presided over both primary 
appeals. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Chapter 60.1.2  By letter dated September 11, 2014, Puna 
Geothermal requested a renewal of the Permit.  The request was 
docketed in the DOH Hearings Office as No. 19-CWBN-5-24 (thePermit Renewal Docket). 
On October 17, 2019, Puna Pono demanded that DOH comply 
with HEPA "by requiring an environmental review be accepted by DOH before Puna Geothermal . . . is allowed to proceed with the renewal of an air pollution permit[.]"  HRS § 343-5 (2010 and Supp. 2019) provided, in relevant part: 
(e) Whenever an applicant proposes an action
specified by subsection (a) that requires approval of an
agency and that is not a specific type of action declaredexempt under section 343–6, the agency initially receivingand agreeing to process the request for approval shallrequire the applicant to prepare an environmental assessmentof the proposed action at the earliest practicable time todetermine whether an environmental impact statement shall berequired[.] 
On October 18, 2019, the DOH Hearings Office asked that 
Puna Pono clarify "which part of HRS § 343-5's 'subsection (a)' 
it believes covers" Puna Geothermal's renewal application.  Puna Pono responded on October 24, 2019. 
On October 25, 2019, the DOH Hearings Office issued an 
order in the Permit Renewal Docket stating: 
Any participants who so desire may file and serve
responses to [Puna Pono]'s demand . . . not later than
Friday, November 8, 2019. 
Any participants who so desire may file and serve
replies to any and all such responses not later thanTuesday, November 19, 2019. 
Puna Geothermal filed a response to Puna Pono's demand 
on November 8, 2019. 
2 A permit under HRS Chapter 342B allows the permit holder to
"construct, modify, relocate, or operate [a] regulated air pollutant source." HRS § 342B-1.  A "source" is "property, real or personal, which emits or mayemit any air pollutant."  HRS § 342B-1; HAR § 11-60.1-1.  A "noncovered source" is a stationary source constructed, modified, or relocated afterMarch 20, 1972, that is not a covered source.  Id. A "covered source" 
includes a source subject to the Section 111 of the federal Clean Air Act, 42U.S.C. § 7401, et seq. 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On November 18, 2019, the DOH Hearings Office issued an 
order stating, in relevant part: 
Questions of whether to require the preparation of
environmental assessments and impact statements are matters
to be resolved by the Director of Health, the DOH'sEnvironmental Health Administration and/or the Clean AirBranch, subject to review in the Courts under the applicable
appellate processes (if any) for such decisions . 
Puna Pono Alliance's [PPA] Demand for Environmental
Review, which asks that an environmental review be acceptedby the DOH before PGV is allowed to proceed with the renewalof [the Permit], is therefore referred to the Director of 
Health , the DOH's Environmental Health Administration and
the Clean Air Branch for them to resolve, along with any andall joinders and de facto joinders therein. 
(emphasis added).  Thus, Puna Pono's demand for an environmental 
review was severed from the Permit Renewal Docket.  No appeal was taken from the order. 
By letter dated December 10, 2019, Steiner also 
demanded that DOH require an environmental impact statement from Puna Geothermal for the Permit Renewal Docket. 
On June 8, 2020, Puna Pono filed a motion in the Permit 
Renewal Docket for "an order that Puna Geothermal Venture (PGV) must prepare an environmental review on the grounds that [HEPA] and related rules of the Department of Health (DOH) applicable to PGV's pending application for a permit renewal require such a review."  Steiner joined in the motion.  Puna Geothermal responded to the motion and joinder on June 25, 2020.  Puna Pono replied on July 6, 2020. 
On August 13, 2020, the DOH Hearings Office issued an 
order denying Puna Pono's June 8, 2020 motion and Steiner's joinder "without prejudice to any rights the Director of Health, the DOH's Environmental Management Division (EMD) and/or the Clean Air Branch (CAB) of the EMD may have to direct an environmental review."  No appeal was taken from the order. 
By letter dated September 4, 2020, the Director 
informed Puna Pono, Steiner, and Puna Geothermal (among others) that "a new or supplemental environmental review is not required to be conducted by the DOH" for the renewal of Puna Geothermal's 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Permit.  The Director's letter was published in DOH's publication 
"The Environmental Notice" on September 23, 2020, as required by HEPA.

Primary Appeals 
On October 21, 2020, the Alliance filed a notice of 
appeal from the Director's decision in the circuit court.  The appeal was taken "pursuant to 
Hawai i # [sic] Revised Statutes 
§§ [sic] 91-14[.]"  The appeal was docketed as 3CCV-20-0000390. On June 3, 2021, the circuit court entered an order dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.  The circuit court concluded that the Director's decision was not "a final decision and order in a contested case[.]"  The Judgment was entered on June 23, 2021.  The Alliance appealed, resulting in CAAP-21-0000388. 
Steiner filed a notice of appeal from the Director's 
decision on October 23, 2020.  Steiner's appeal was also taken "pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes 'HRS' § 91-14[.]"  The appeal was docketed as 3CCV-20-0000398.  On June 22, 2021, the circuit court entered an order dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.  The circuit court concluded that the Director's decision "was not a contested case[.]"  The Amended Judgment was entered on December 16, 2021.  Steiner appealed, resulting in CAAP-21-000392. 
Standard of Review 
"A trial court's dismissal for lack of subject matter 
jurisdiction is a question of law, reviewable de novo."  Tax Found. of 
Hawai# i v. State, 144 Hawai# i 175, 185, 439 P.3d 127, 
137 (2019). 
3 HRS § 343-3 (2010) (part of HEPA) provides, in relevant part: 
(b) The office [of planning and sustainable
development] shall inform the public of notices filed by
agencies of the availability of environmental assessmentsfor review and comments, of determinations that statementsare required or not required[.] 
See also HAR § 11-200.1-4 (2019). 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Discussion 
HRS § 91-14(a) (2012) allows "[a]ny person aggrieved by 
a final decision and order 
in a contested case" to seek judicial 
review.  (Emphasis added.)  The Hawai# i Supreme Court has held: 
The first requirement for judicial review under HRS
§ 91-14 is that the appeal be from a contested case 
proceeding.  A "contested case" is "a proceeding in which
the legal rights, duties, or privileges of specific partiesare required by law to be determined after an opportunityfor agency hearing."  HRS § 91-1.  For an agency hearing tobe "required by law" it must be required by agency rule,statute, or constitutional due process. 
Cmty. Ass'ns of Hualalai, Inc. v. Leeward Plan. Comm'n, 150 
Hawai# i 241, 255, 500 P.3d 426, 440 (2021) (emphasis added) 
(citations omitted). 
Neither the Alliance nor Steiner cite to any agency 
rule or statute that required a contested case hearing for the 
Director's determination under HRS § 343-5.  Instead, the Alliance relies on four cases.  The cases are distinguishable because in each, the appeal was taken from a contested case hearing in which the administrative agency determined that no HEPA environmental assessment was necessary. 
In McGlone v. Inaba, 64 Haw. 27, 636 P.2d 158 (1981), 
abrogated in part by Camara v. Agsalud  , 67 Haw. 212, 215-16, 685 
P.2d 794, 796-97 (1984) (disavowing McGlone to the extent it suggests an agency's conclusions of law are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard), the Board of Land and Natural Resources (BLNR) approved the defendants' conservation district 
use application (CDUA) during a regularly scheduled meeting, 
without requiring the defendants to prepare an environmental 
impact statement (EIS).  The plaintiffs, who opposed the CDUA, 
sued BLNR for injunctive and declaratory relief.  The circuit 
court remanded the case to BLNR for a contested case hearing. BLNR conducted a contested case hearing, then "unanimously reaffirmed its earlier determination that [the defendants'] proposed construction was exempt from preparation of an EIS and thus reapproved [the] CDUA."  Id. at 31, 636 P.2d at 161-62.  The 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
plaintiffs again filed suit, seeking a preliminary injunction. 
The circuit court denied the preliminary injunction and affirmed the BLNR decision approving the CDUA.  The plaintiffs appealed to the supreme court.  Thus, the primary and secondary appeals in McGlone were taken from the BLNR decision approving the CDUA after a contested case hearing. 
In Pearl Ridge Ests. Cmty. Ass'n v. Lear Siegler, Inc., 
65 Haw. 133, 648 P.2d 702 (1982) the supreme court held "that when an application is made for the reclassification of conservation lands to other uses, an environmental assessment is necessary before the LUC [Land Use Commission] can reclassify the lands."  Id. at 134, 648 P.2d at 704.  In that case, "After due notice to interested persons, the Commission conducted a [contested case] hearing in accord with the procedure prescribed by HRS Chapter 205."  Id. at 136, 648 P.2d at 704 (Nakamura, J. concurring). 
In Kahana Sunset Owners Ass'n v. Cnty. of Maui, 86 
Hawai# i 66, 947 P.2d 378 (1997), the Maui county planning 
commission decided that no HEPA environmental assessment was required to grant a Special Management Area (SMA) permit.  "A 
contested case hearing on the granting of the SMA permit was held 
over the course of thirteen days[.]"  Id. at 68, 947 P.2d at 380. The appeal was taken from the planning commission's decision, after the contested case hearing, to grant the SMA permit. 
And in Sierra Club v. Off. of Plan., 109 
Hawai# i 411, 
126 P.3d 1098 (2006) the appeal was from the Land Use Commission's decision, after a contested case hearing, to reclassify land from agricultural to urban without requiring an HEPA environmental assessment.  Id. at 420-21, 126 P.3d at 1107-08. 
In this case, the DOH Hearings Officer severed Puna 
Pono's HEPA demand from the Puna Geothermal Permit Renewal Docket, and denied Puna Pono's June 8, 2020 motion and Steiner's joinder "without prejudice to any rights the Director . . . may have to direct an environmental review."  No appeal was taken. 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Director, without conducting a contested case hearing, 
determined that an HEPA environmental review was not required. The Alliance and Steiner's remedy under HEPA would have been to initiate a "judicial proceeding, the subject of which is the determination that a statement is not required for a proposed action, . . . within thirty days after the public has been informed of such determination pursuant to section 343-3."  HRS § 343-7(b) (2010 & Supp. 2019).  The Alliance's and Steiner's actions below were instead brought under HRS § 91-14.  Because the Director's determination was not made after a contested case hearing, the circuit court correctly dismissed the actions for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. 
For the foregoing reasons, the Judgment entered by the 
circuit court on June 23, 2021, in 3CCV-20-0000390, and the Amended Judgment entered by the circuit court on December 16, 2021, in 3CCV-20-0000398, are affirmed.
