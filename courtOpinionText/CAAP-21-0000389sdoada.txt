SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.)  
Plaintiffs
-Appellants Annamarie Kon et al. appeal from 
the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit's April 19, 2021 Final 
Judgment.1 On appeal, Plaintiffs challenge the circuit court's 
granting of summary judgment in favor of Defendants-Appellees 
Puna Geothermal Venture (or PGV) and State of Hawai‘ i Department 
of Health (DOH).2 
1 The Honorable Henry T. Nakamoto presided. 
2 Plaintiffs also challenge the denial of their motion for 
reconsideration. Based on our decision, we need not address this issue.   
 
 
  
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve this appeal as discussed below and vacate and remand. 
According to Puna Geothermal's motion for summary 
judgment, it was operating under a 2009 Noncovered Source Permit issued by DOH's Clean Air Branch (DOH Permit or NSP). In 2014, Puna Geothermal filed a timely application to renew its DOH Permit, but community members (not Plaintiffs) requested a contested case hearing regarding further environmental review, which was delayed for various reasons.
3 One reason for the 
contested case hearing delay was the 2018 Kīlauea eruption that 
caused Puna Geothermal to shut down for over a year. However, 
the DOH Director ultimately determined that further environmental review was not required to renew Puna Geothermal's DOH Permit. 
Plaintiffs filed a complaint for declaratory and 
injunctive relief. Plaintiffs alleged that Puna Geothermal's application "to renew DOH air pollution permits for an action that uses state land" required an environmental review or, in 
the alternative, that substantive changes to the project

permit renewal are 15- CWBN-8-13 and 19- CWBN-5-24.

required a supplemental environmental review. (Emphasis 
omitted.) 
Puna Geothermal moved for summary judgment, arguing it 
was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because there was no 
"action" under Hawai‘ i Revised Statutes (HRS) Chapter 343, the 
Hawai‘i Environmental Policy Act (HEPA).4 Puna Geothermal argued 
that the "renewal request" was "for the fully developed Facility 
that has been in commercial operation for more than twenty-five years, and not for any change in the Facility or its operations. It is therefore, not an 'action' as a matter of law." (Emphases 
omitted.) 
The circuit court granted Puna Geothermal's motion for 
summary judgment, concluding "the renewal of the permit" was not 
an "action": 
It is undisputed that PGV's geothermal facility 
("Facility") was developed decades ago and the potential
environmental impacts were disclosed in a 1987
[Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)].  The Court finds the renewal of PGV's NSP is not for any change in theFacility or its operations, and concludes that the renewal 
of the permit is not an "action" as a matter of law. 
(Emphases added.) 
4 Puna Geothermal also argued there was no HEPA "trigger." See HRS 
§ 343-5(a) (2010). Plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment on the 
issue of whether there was a trigger, which the circuit court granted. Puna Geothermal did not appeal or cross- appeal from the circuit court's decision.  
Thus, the trigger issue is not before us.

This court reviews the grant or denial of summary 
judgment de novo. Villaver v. Sylva, 145 Hawai‘ i 29, 34, 445 
P.3d 701, 706 (2019). 
The burden is on the party moving for summary judgment 
"to show the absence of any genuine issue as to all material 
facts, which, under applicable principles of substantive law, entitles the moving party to judgment as a matter of law." 
Umberger v. Dep't of Land & Nat. Res., 140 
Hawai‘i 500, 528, 403 
P.3d 277, 305 (2017) (citations omitted). A defendant movant 
"may satisfy [its] initial burden of production by either 
(1) presenting evidence negating an element of the non-movant's 
claim, or (2) demonstrating that the [non-movant] will be unable to carry his or her burden of proof at trial." Ralston v. Yim, 
129 Hawai‘ i 46, 60, 292 P.3d 1276, 1290 (2013). 
Where there is an "action" proposed for state lands, 
an environmental assessment is required (unless exempted). 
HRS 
§§ 343-5(a)(1), -6(a)(2) (2010). HEPA defines "action" as "any 
program or project to be initiated by any agency or applicant." HRS § 343-2 (2010). 
In the context of permit renewals, it is not the 
renewal of the permit that is a HEPA action; it is the activity 
under the permit that may constitute a HEPA action. Carmichael

233 (2022) ("As demonstrated by our opinion in Umberger, it is 
the applicant's permitted activity—i.e., the activity for which the A&B Defendants initially sought permit approval—that constitutes 'action' within the meaning of HEPA."). 
Thus, the circuit court correctly concluded that the 
renewal of the DOH Permit was not a HEPA action. However, the circuit court erred by not considering whether the activity allowed under the DOH Permit was an "action." This error might have been harmless if Puna Geothermal nonetheless met its summary judgment burden. 
To satisfy its summary judgment burden, Puna 
Geothermal attempted to show that Plaintiffs could not prove the 
"action" element of their claim by providing the circuit court 
with the following: 
(1) a citation to Thermal Power Co.'s 1987 environmental impact statement for the Puna Geothermal Venture Project (1987 EIS);
5 
(2) the January 22, 2021 declaration of Michael L. 
Kaleikini, "Senior Director, Hawai‘ i Affairs, of 
Ormat Technologies, Inc."; and

Impact Statement (1987) [hereinafter 1987 EIS],

(3) a September 8, 2019 letter from the Department of 
Land and Natural Resources (DLNR) Chairperson, attached to which was an August 22, 2019 letter from Puna Geothermal's attorney to the DLNR 
Chairperson. 
In its reply to Plaintiffs' memorandum in opposition, Puna 
Geothermal included: 
(4) the March 9, 2020 declaration of Darin W.C. Lum, an Environmental Engineer V with DOH's Clean Air Branch, submitted in another proceeding. 
As to Kaleikini's and Lum's declarations, they did not 
expressly identify the activity allowed under the DOH Permit and 
the activity proposed under the renewal application. And 
assuming arguendo that Puna Geothermal's August 22, 2019 letter to the DLNR Chairperson was admissible evidence, the letter also did not identify the activity allowed under the DOH Permit and the activity proposed under the renewal application. Finally, Puna Geothermal did not provide the circuit court with the DOH Permit or the renewal application. 
Without evidence showing the activity allowed under 
the DOH Permit and the activity proposed under the renewal application, Puna Geothermal could not meet its summary judgment burden of negating the "action" element under HEPA.

Thus, the circuit court erred in granting Puna 
Geothermal's motion for summary judgment. 
Based on the foregoing, we vacate the circuit court's 
April 19, 2021 "Order Granting (1) Plaintiffs' Motion for 
Partial Summary Judgment, Filed on January 11, 2021, and 
(2) Defendant Puna Geothermal Venture's Motion for Summary Judgment, Filed on January 22, 2021" to the extent it granted Puna Geothermal's motion for summary judgment, and we vacate the April 19, 2021 Final Judgment. (Formatting altered.) We remand this case to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this summary disposition order.
