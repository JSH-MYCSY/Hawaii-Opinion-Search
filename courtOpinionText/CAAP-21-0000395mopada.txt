STATE OF HAWAI‘ I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v. 
ROMMEL L. BAUTISTA, Defendant-Appellant. 
 
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 2CPC-20-0000366) 
  
MEMORANDUM OPINION 
(By:  Leonard, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and McCullen, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Rommel L. Bautista (Bautista
) 
appeals from the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit's March 10, 
2021 Judgment; Conviction and Sentence; Notice of Entry.1  
Following a no-contest plea, Bautista was convicted of 
(1) Assault in the Second Degree, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707-711(1)(a) (Supp. 2018); (2)
 Terroristic 
Threatening in the First Degree, in violation of HRS § 707-

 716(1)(e) (2014); and (3) Felony Abuse of Family or Household 
Member, in violation of HRS § 709-906(1) and (9) (Supp. 2019). 
The circuit court sentenced Bautista to a five-year 
term of imprisonment for each count, to be served consecutively.   On appeal, Bautista challenges the circuit court's jurisdiction, 
the lawfulness of the prosecution, and the consecutive nature of 
his sentence.  For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.    
I. Background 
 
A. Complaint And Committal 
 
On July 27, 2020, the State filed a complaint in the 
District Court of the Second Circuit, charging Bautista with 
seven felony offenses and alleging that all offenses occurred in 
the County of Maui, State of Hawai‘ i.
2  Finding probable cause, 
                                                           
2  The Honorable Blaine J. Kobayashi, and the Honorable Kirstin M. 
Hamman presided over the district court proceedings. 
 
The seven charged counts were as follows: 
 
Count 1: Attempted Murder in the Second Degree, in violation of HRS 
§§ 705-500(2) (2014) and 707- 701.5 (2014 and Supp. 2018), and 
subject to HRS § 706-656 (2014);  
 
Count 2: Assault in the First Degree, in violation of HRS § 707-710(1) 
(2014); 
 Count 3: Assault in the Second Degree, in violation of HRS § 707-
711(1)(a); 
 
Count 4: Terroristic Threatening in the First Degree, in violation of 
HRS § 707-716(1)(e); 
 Count 5: Felony Abuse of Family or Household Member, by strangulation, 
in violation of HRS §§ 709-906(1) and/or (8) (Supp. 2019); 
 
Count 6: Felony Abuse of Family or Household Member, by strangulation, 
in violation of HRS §§ 709-906(1) and/or (8); and  
 
Count 7: Felony Abuse of Family or Household Member, in the presence of 
a minor, in violation of HRS §§ 709-906(1) and/or (9).
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 the district court committed the case to the circuit court and a 
hearing was scheduled in circuit court for August 12, 2020 at 
8:00 a.m. in Courtroom #4.  A case was then initiated in circuit 
court based on that committal. 
B. No-Contest Plea 
 
About five months later, Bautista pled no contest to 
Assault in the Second Degree (Count 3), Terroristic Threatening 
in the First Degree (Count 4), and Felony Abuse of Family or 
Household Member, minor present (Count 7) in exchange for 
dismissing the remaining charges of Attempted Murder in the 
Second Degree (Count 1), Assault in the First Degree (Count 2), 
and Felony Abuse of a Family or Household Member, by 
strangulation (Counts 5 and 6).  On the no-contest plea form, Bautista acknowledged that he was giving "up the right to appeal 
anything that has happened in this case to date" and that the 
circuit court may impose consecutive terms of imprisonment. 
During the hearing on Bautista's no-contest plea, the 
circuit court reiterated that "the maximum penalty provided by 
law for these offenses is fifteen years in prison and a $30,000 
fine[,]" and Bautista acknowledged his understanding.  The circuit court again explained, "So when I mentioned fifteen 
years earlier, that's if I ran everything consecutively, one 
after the other. . . .
 I got that by adding five plus five plus 
five . . . ."  Bautista then requested a continuance to speak with his family, and the circuit court granted the request. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 The next week, the circuit court again reviewed the 
no-contest plea with Bautista and explained that "the maximum 
penalty provided by law for these offenses is a fifteen-year 
prison term and a $30,000 fine[,]" and Bautista acknowledged that he understood.  Later in the hearing, the circuit court 
reiterated that it "could sentence [him] to the full fifteen-
year prison term[,]" and Bautista acknowledged his 
understanding. 
After the circuit court's colloquy, Bautista pled no-
contest.  The circuit court accepted Bautista's plea and ordered 
a presentence report, which was filed with the circuit court. 
C. Sentencing 
 
1. State's Argument 
 
During the sentencing hearing, the State requested 
consecutive sentencing based on the circumstances of the 
incident.  The State explained that Bautista attacked his wife 
(Wife) because he thought she was having affairs and would not 
admit it.  Bautista "slapped her face, and then grabbed her 
throat, impeding her breathing.  He also then kicked her in the 
ribs and body and stomped on her chest . . . ."  He told her he was going to kill her, and "grabbed the ceramic toilet tank 
cover and made a motion like he was going to hit her."  When 
Bautista's father banged on the door, Wife seized "the chance to 
grab her six-year-old son and leave the house and call a friend NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
 
5 
 for help."  The friend took them to the police station where she 
was checked by medics and transferred to the emergency room. 
Wife had redness and abrasions on her nose, left 
cheek, ear, chest, and back "as well as a lump on the back of her head and redness on both sides of her neck."  Wife also had 
bruises on her scalp behind her left ear, and on her upper arms 
and lower legs.  She was "also diagnosed with a fracture of her 
right second, third, and fourth ribs as well as a collapsed 
lung." 
The State acknowledged that Bautista's "family appears 
to have forgiven him" and "would like to see him return home."  
The State, however, noted that Bautista's six-year-old son was 
present during the incident, and "told the police he saw his father punch his mother, [and] grab her neck . . . ."  The State 
requested that the circuit court sentence Bautista to five years 
imprisonment for each offense, to be served consecutively. 
2. Defense's Argument 
 
Defense counsel confirmed that they reviewed the 
presentence report, and nothing needed to be corrected.  Defense 
counsel explained that it was Wife that "woke him from a sleep and was yelling at him, and that's what started it."  Defense 
counsel asked the court to take into account Wife's plea for 
leniency and that he never hit her before.  Defense counsel 
explained that Bautista "did not intend to end her life[,]" but 
"was trying to force a confession out of her as to what he NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
 
6 
 believed to be infidelity and threatened her with the intent to 
make her believe that he might kill her, do her serious harm in 
order to get her to confess." 
3. Circuit Court's Decision 
 
After expressing concern for Bautista's son and the 
effects this incident may have on him later, the circuit court 
stated that "there was no part of your wife's body that was not 
untouched."  The circuit court recognized that "the doctor at 
the hospital did confirm the extent of her injuries with the 
facial bruising, the collapsed lung, which could have caused 
death, fracture to not one rib but three different ribs . . . ." 
"I think the only reason you stopped was perhaps 
because your father was pounding on the front door . . . and this gave an opportunity for your wife to get out of the house 
with the six-year-old, your son . . . ." 
The circuit court explained that it "had an 
opportunity today to review the options of sentencing" and could 
possibly give probation or concurrent sentences.  The circuit 
court confirmed that it heard the arguments and Bautista's 
statement, read the letters submitted by his family and Wife, and considered that Bautista had no previous record. 
Nonetheless, the circuit court stated that "this is a 
very severe case. . . . And the nature of these -- of these 
charges, though it's come off the attempted murder, are 
extremely serious . . . ."  Additionally, the circuit court NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
 
7 
 stated, "your adult daughter talks about how you folks would 
argue almost every night, and it was so bad that she didn't even 
want to live at home at one point." 
Wife "needs to be protected.  Your son needs to be 
protected.  The community needs to be protected from his kind of behavior."  The circuit court sentenced Bautista to a five-year 
term of imprisonment for each of the three convicted offenses, 
to be served consecutively.  Bautista filed an untimely notice of appeal.
3  See Hawai‘ i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 
Rule 4(b) (providing that in a criminal case "the notice of 
appeal shall be filed within 30 days after entry of judgment or 
order appealed from"). 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW 
 
A.  Jurisdiction 
 
"[T]he court's jurisdiction to consider matters 
brought before it is a question of law which is subject to de 
novo review on appeal applying the 'right/wrong' standard."  
State v. Lorenzo, 77 
Hawai‘i 219, 220, 883 P.2d 641, 642 
(App. 1994) (citations omitted). 
  
                                                           
3  In criminal cases, this court has made exceptions to the requirement 
that the notice of appeal be timely filed where "defense counsel has 
inexcusably or ineffectively failed to pursue a defendant's appeal from a 
criminal conviction in the first instance[.]"  State v. Irvine, 88 Hawai‘ i 
404, 407, 967 P.2d 236, 239 (1998); State v. Chavira, 120 Hawai‘ i 255, 203 
P.3d 675, No. 29082, 2009 WL 458772 at *1 (App. Feb. 25, 2009) (SDO).  It 
appears that Bautista's former counsel failed to file a timely notice of 
appeal.

 B. Sufficiency Of The Charge 
 
"Whether a charge sets forth all the essential 
elements of a charged offense is a question of law, which we 
review under the de novo, or right/wrong, standard."  State v. 
Wheeler, 121 Hawai‘ i 383, 390, 219 P.3d 1170, 1177 (2009) 
(cleaned up). 
C. Sentencing 
 
Sentencing matters are reviewed for an abuse of 
discretion.  State v. Mundon, 121 Hawai‘ i 339, 349, 219 P.3d 
1126, 1136 (2009) (quoting State v. Kahapea, 111 Hawai‘ i 267, 
278, 141 P.3d 440, 451 (2006)). 
III. Discussion 
 
In his opening brief, Bautista challenged the 
consecutive nature of his sentence.  But, after being granted 
leave to amend his opening brief, Bautista additionally 
challenged the circuit court's subject matter jurisdiction. 
Bautista then submitted an HRAP Rule 28(j) letter to 
this court citing to the Hawai‘ i Supreme Court's opinion in State 
v. Obrero, 151 Hawai‘ i 472, 517 P.3d 755 (2022), and this court 
ordered the parties to submit supplemental briefing addressing 
the effect Obrero has on this case.  In his supplemental brief, 
Bautista asserts that his conviction is unlawful in light of Obrero. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
 
9 
 Bautista applied to have this case transferred to the 
Hawai‘i Supreme Court, but that application was rejected.  Of the 
three points of error he raises throughout these proceedings, we 
address Bautista's challenge to the circuit court's jurisdiction 
first.   
A. The Circuit Court Had Jurisdiction 
 
Bautista contends that the circuit court had no 
jurisdiction over his case because the State did not file a 
complaint in the circuit court.  To support this contention, 
Bautista asserts that once the district court committed the case 
to circuit court, the State "had to take an active role in 
initiating the proceedings in circuit court by filing a charging 
document.  Its failure to do that means that the circuit court's 
subject matter jurisdiction never attached."  In his 
supplemental brief, Bautista acknowledges Footnote 12 in Obrero, 
but reiterates that the State "needed to file a 'cognizable' 
charging instrument in the circuit court.  Without it, the 
circuit court lacked jurisdiction to convict and sentence" him. 
"Jurisdiction is defined as 'the power and authority 
on the part of the court to hear and judicially determine and 
dispose of the cause pending before it.'"  Schwartz v. State, 
136 Hawai‘ i 258, 262, 361 P.3d 1161, 1165 (2015) (quoting 
State v. Villados, 55 Haw. 394, 396, 520 P.2d 427, 430 (1974) ). 
"'[J]urisdiction depends upon the state of affairs existing at NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
 
10 
 the time it is invoked; once having attached, it . . . is 
retained by a court until fully exhausted by the entry of a 
final judgment.'  It is not lost by subsequent events, . . . 
unless a statute provides otherwise."  136 Hawai‘ i at 262, 361 
P.3d at 1165 (citation omitted). 
 1. Obrero, HRS, and HRPP 
 
In Obrero, the Hawai‘ i Supreme Court held that the 
State's prosecution of the defendant by complaint instead of 
indictment violated HRS § 801-1 (2014).  Obrero, 151 Hawai‘ i at 
475, 482, 517 P.3d at 758, 765.  Nevertheless, in Footnote 12, 
the supreme court explained that "[t]he unlawfulness of the 
State's prosecution did not deprive the circuit court of 
subject-matter jurisdiction."  151 Hawai‘ i at 478 n.12, 517 P.3d 
at 761 n.12. 
The supreme court explained that the State filed six 
separate complaints in the district court.  151 Hawai‘ i at 475, 
517 P.3d at 758.  But after the district court found probable 
cause and committed the case to circuit court, the State 
consolidated the six complaints into a single complaint, and filed that complaint in the circuit court.  151 
Hawai‘i at 476, 
476 n.4, 517 P.3d at 759, 759 n.4.  
Quoting HRS § 603-21.5(a)(1) (2016), the supreme court 
explained that "the circuit courts have jurisdiction over 
'criminal offenses cognizable under the laws of the State, NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
 
11 
 committed within their respective circuits or transferred to 
them for trial by change of venue from some other circuit 
court.'"  151 Hawai‘ i at 478 n.12, 517 P.3d at 761 n.12 (citation 
and brackets omitted).  Cognizable was defined as "capable of 
being known or recognized, or capable of being judicially tried 
or examined before a designated tribunal; within the court's 
jurisdiction."  Id. (citation and internal quotation marks 
omitted). 
The supreme court then concluded that "the State's 
complaint properly invoked the circuit court's subject matter 
jurisdiction" because it alleged offenses recognized under our 
State laws and these offenses were committed in the City and 
County of Honolulu.  Id.  
HRS chapter 805 governs criminal procedure in the 
district courts.  "When a complaint is made to any prosecuting 
officer of the commission of any offense, the prosecuting officer shall examine the complaint, shall reduce the substance 
of the complaint to writing . . . ."  HRS § 805-1 (2014).  "In 
all cases of arrest for offenses that must be tried in the first 
instance before a jury, or that can be tried only on indictment 
by a grand jury," the judge, "upon the appearance of the 
accused, shall proceed to consider whether there is probable 
cause to believe that the accused is guilty of the offense with which the accused is charged."  HRS § 805-7 (2014). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
 
12 
     "[I]f in the judge's opinion there is probable cause 
to believe that the accused is guilty of the offense" the 
accused is charged with, "the judge shall make out and deliver 
to a police officer a mittimus which may be in the form established by the usage and practice of the issuing court."  
HRS § 805-7.  "In all criminal cases had before a district judge 
where there has been a commitment as provided in section 805-7, 
. . . the judge, forthwith, shall send to the county attorney or 
prosecuting attorney . . . giving the name of the defendant and 
the date the records were sent to the circuit court . . . ."  
HRS § 805-8 (2014).  
HRS chapter 806 governs criminal procedure in circuit 
court, but contains no requirement to refile a complaint following a commitment from district court.  Offering some 
guidance, the Hawai‘ i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) provide the 
procedure for committing a case to the circuit court.
4  "If the 
defendant is held to answer in the circuit court, the court 
shall transmit to the circuit court all papers and articles 
received in evidence at the preliminary hearing and any bail 
received by it."  HRPP Rule 5(c)(6) (emphasis added).  "Within 7 
                                                           
4  In Obrero, the supreme court explained that HRPP Rules 5 and 7 
"flatly contradict HRS § 801- 1" and "[w]here a court- made rule affecting 
litigants' substantive rights contravenes the dictates of a parallel statute, 
the rule must give way."  Obrero, 151 Hawai‘ i at 480,  517 P.3d at 763 (quoting 
Cox v. Cox, 138 Hawai‘ i 476, 482, 382 P.3d 288, 294 (2016)).  The supreme 
court did not, however, expressly declare HRPP Rules 5 and 7 invalid in all 
respects.  See id.  Moreover, our reference to HRPP Rules 5 and 7 is in the 
context of determining jurisdiction, not the violation of HRS § 801- 1. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
 
13 
 days after the district court's oral order of commitment (i) the 
district court shall sign its written order of commitment, 
(ii) the clerk shall enter the district court's written order, 
and (iii) the clerk shall transmit to the circuit court all 
documents in the proceeding . . . ."  HRPP Rule 5(c)(7) 
(emphasis added and formatting altered). 
Finally, HRPP Rule 7(h) addresses the court in which a 
charge is filed.  HRPP Rule 7(h) first states that "[a]n indictment or information shall be filed in the circuit court."  
HRPP Rule 7(h)(1).  HRPP Rule 7(h) then states that "[a] 
complaint may be filed in either the district or circuit court; 
provided that a complaint shall not be filed initially in the 
circuit court when it charges (i) a felony, and none of the 3 conditions set forth in Rule 7(b) of these rules has yet 
occurred," or "(ii) only an offense or offenses other than a 
felony."
5  HRPP Rule 7(h)(2) (formatting altered); See HRPP 
                                                           
5  HRPP Rule 7(b) provides,  
 
A felony may be prosecuted by a complaint under any of the 
following 3 conditions: 
 (1) if with respect to that felony the district judge has 
found probable cause at a preliminary hearing and has committed the defendant to answer in the circuit court 
pursuant to Rule 5(c) of these rules;  
 (2) if, pursuant to 5(c)(2) of these rules, the defendant 
has waived in open court the right to a preliminary hearing; or  
 
(3) if, pursuant to 7(c) of these rules, the defendant has 
waived in open court the right to an indictment. 
 (Formatting altered.)

14 
 Rule 2 (providing that these rules "shall be construed to secure 
simplicity in procedure, fairness in administration and the 
elimination of unjustifiable expense and delay"). 
In sum, nothing in HRS chapters 805 and 806, and HRPP 
Rules 5 and 7, require the State to refile a complaint in the circuit court after the district court committed the case to the 
circuit court upon a finding of probable cause. 
 2. Analysis 
 
Here, the State filed a complaint with seven felony 
counts in the district court.  According to the court minutes, 
the district court held a hearing and found probable cause as to 
those seven counts.
6  After finding probable cause, the district 
court orally committed the case, and each count, to the circuit 
court. 
That same day, the district court entered a "Committal  
to the Circuit Court" and "Amended Order and Notice of Entry of 
Order," committing Bautista's case to the circuit court for 
further proceedings and ordering Bautista to appear in the 
circuit court on August 12, 2020 at 8:00 a.m.  Also on that day, 
a circuit court case was initiated based on the district court's commitment with service made to the parties.
7 
                                                           
6  Bautista did not order transcripts of this proceeding and did not 
file a notice indicating that he was ordering fewer than all transcripts.  
See HRAP Rule 10(b)(4).   
 
7  The "Commitment to Circuit Court" docketed as No. 1 does not contain 
a readable pdf. 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
 
15 
   That charging instrument filed in the district court 
and committed to the circuit court alleged that Bautista 
violated HRS §§ 705-500(2) and 707-701.5, 707-710(1), 707-
711(1)(a), 707-716(1)(e), 709-906(1) and/or (8), and 709-906(1) 
and/or (9), all of which are recognized offenses under Hawaii ‘ 
law.  That same complaint also alleged that the offenses 
occurred "in the Division of Wailuku, County of Maui, State of Hawaii," which is in the Second Circuit.  HRS § 603-1 (2016) 
("The second judicial circuit includes the islands of Maui, 
Molokai, Lanai, Kahoolawe, and Molokini.")  Because the 
complaint charged Bautista with cognizable offenses within the 
second circuit, the requirements of HRS § 603-21.5(a)(1) were 
satisfied. 
Bautista does not cite to, and we have not found, a 
statute or rule that requires the State to refile a complaint in 
the circuit court after the district court has committed the case to circuit court upon a finding of probable cause.  
Moreover, we decline to interpret Footnote 12 in Obrero as 
requiring as much because the complaint committed to the circuit court satisfied the requirements of HRS § 603-21.5(a)(1) to 
invoke the circuit court's jurisdiction.  See 151 Hawai‘ i at 478 
n.12, 517 P.3d at 761 n.12. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
 
16 
 B. Complaint Presumed Valid 
 
Bautista next contends that the State violated HRS 
§ 801-1 by failing to obtain an indictment, and that the 
"prosecution against [him] is unlawful and the judgment must be vacated." 
HRS § 801-1 provides, "No person shall be subject to 
be tried and sentenced to be punished in any court, for an 
alleged offense, unless upon indictment or information, except 
for offenses within the jurisdiction of a district court or in 
summary proceedings for contempt."  As mentioned, the supreme 
court in Obrero held that the "State's prosecution of Obrero 
[was] unlawful because it [had] not complied with the statute's 
indictment requirement."  Obrero, 151 Hawai‘ i at 478, 517 P.3d at 
761. 
However, the supreme court noted that 
had Obrero challenged the State's failure to comply with 
HRS § 801- 1 for the first time on appeal, we would presume 
the validity of the complaint against him and would not 
reverse his conviction absent a showing that the complaint 
prejudiced him or could not be construed to charge a crime.  
 
151 Hawai‘ i at 478 n.11, 517 P.3d at 761 n.11 (citing Wheeler, 
121 Hawai‘ i at 399, 219 P.3d at 1186).  In Wheeler, the supreme 
court explained that 
there is a 'presumption of validity,' . . . for charges 
challenged subsequent to a conviction.  In those 
circumstances, this court will 'not reverse a conviction 
based upon a defective indictment [or complaint] unless the 
defendant can show prejudice or that the indictment [or 
complaint] cannot within reason be construed to charge a 
crime.' NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
 
17 
   Wheeler, 121 Hawai‘ i at 399-400, 219 P.3d at 1186-87 (citations 
omitted, brackets in original). 
Here, Bautista raised the State's violation of HRS 
§ 801-1 for the first time on appeal in his supplemental brief.   
Thus, as the supreme court explained, we presume the complaint 
is valid.  See generally, 151 Hawai‘ i at 478 n.11, 517 P.3d at 
761 n.11.  Bautista made no showing that the complaint 
prejudiced him.  And, as discussed above, the complaint alleged 
recognizable offenses under Hawai‘ i law.  Absent a showing of 
prejudice or that the charges could not be construed as a crime, 
we cannot vacate Bautista's judgment of conviction and sentence.     
C. No Abuse Of Discretion In Consecutive Sentencing 
 
Finally, Bautista contends that the circuit court 
"abused its discretion when it imposed consecutive terms of 
imprisonment."  (Formatting altered.)  Bautista argues that the 
"circuit court's justification is unsupported in the record and 
is not based on a rational and fair decision."  Bautista asserts 
that the circuit court ignored Wife's pleas for leniency and 
"based its sentence on the speculative possibility that [Wife] 
could have died and that she had been strangled[,]" and in so 
doing, relied on an uncharged crime. 
HRS § 706-606 (2014) delineates the factors the 
circuit court must consider in imposing a sentence: NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
 
18 
 (1) The nature and circumstances of the offense and the 
history and characteristics of the defendant; 
 
(2)  The need for the sentence imposed: 
 
(a) To reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for law, and to provide just 
punishment for the offense; 
 
(b) To afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; 
 
(c) To protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and 
 
(d) To provide the defendant with needed educational or 
vocational training, medical care, or other 
correctional treatment in the most effective 
manner; 
 (3)  The kinds of sentences available; and  
(4)  The need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities 
among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.

"A sentencing judge generally has broad discretion in 
imposing a sentence."  State v. Barrios, 139 Hawai‘ i 321, 328, 
389 P.3d 916, 923 (2016) (citation omitted).  "Further, '[t]he 
weight to be given the factors set forth in HRS § 706–606 in 
imposing sentence is a matter generally left to the discretion 
of the sentencing court, taking into consideration the 
circumstances of each case.'"  Id. (citations omitted). 
"[A] sentencing court is additionally required to 
explain on the record its reasoning based on the HRS § 706–
606 factors to ensure that its 'decision to impose consecutive 
sentences was deliberate, rational, and fair.'"  139 Hawai‘ i at 
335, 389 P.3d at 930 (quoting State v. Hussein, 122 Hawai‘ i 495, 
510, 229 P.3d 313, 328 (2010)).  However, "the sentencing court NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
 
19 
 is not required to articulate and explain its conclusions with 
respect to every factor listed in HRS § 706-606, but rather must 
articulate its reasoning only with respect to those factors it 
relies on in imposing consecutive sentences."  See Barrios, 139 
Hawai‘i at 336, 389 P.3d at 931 (cleaned up).  
Here, the circuit court considered the nature and 
circumstances of the offense.  The circuit court stated that 
"there was no part of your wife's body that was not untouched."   
The circuit court recognized that "the doctor at the hospital 
did confirm the extent of her injuries with the facial bruising, 
the collapsed lung, which could have caused death, [and] 
fracture to not one rib but three different ribs . . . ." 
The circuit court noted concern for Bautista's six-
year-old son, and further noted that it thought "the only reason 
you stopped was perhaps because your father was pounding on the 
front door . . . and this gave an opportunity for your wife to get out of the house with the six-year-old, your son . . . ." 
The circuit court also considered the possible 
sentences available.  The circuit court explained that it "had 
an opportunity today to review the options of sentencing" and 
could possibly give probation or concurrent sentences.  The 
court confirmed that it heard the arguments and Bautista's 
statement, read the letters submitted by his family and Wife, and considered that Bautista had no previous record. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 The circuit court then went on to consider the need 
for the sentence imposed.  The circuit court stated that "this 
is a very severe case. . . . [Y]our adult daughter talks about 
how you folks would argue almost every night, and it was so bad that she didn't even want to live at home at one point."  The 
circuit court explained that Wife "needs to be protected.  Your 
son needs to be protected.  The community needs to be protected 
from his kind of behavior." 
Turning to Bautista's assertion that the circuit court 
relied on uncharged crimes of attempted murder and felony abuse 
by strangulation, we must consider the circuit court's 
statements in context.  The circuit court stated, "[s]o these 
offenses are so serious you could have killed your wife.  She had a collapsed lung, and you broke at least three of her ribs, 
not to mention all the bruising from head to toe."  The circuit 
court also stated, 
[s]o if something so silly as accusing her of an affair can 
set you off to the point where you break her ribs, strangle 
her, and knock her to the ground, threaten to kill her -- I 
think she did say at one point, on a scale of one to ten, 
she rated her fear as a ten.  
These statements reflect the seriousness of Bautista's conduct 
and the need "to protect the public," which are permissible 
considerations when imposing consecutive sentencing.   
Based on the record before us, we cannot say that the 
circuit court's sentence was arbitrary or capricious, or that the circuit court refused to consider Bautista's contentions.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
