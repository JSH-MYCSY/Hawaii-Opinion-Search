APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 5CC191000062)  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka and McCullen, JJ.) 
Jared K. Murayama  appeals from the June 4, 2021 " Order 
Denying [Murayama]'s Second Motion for Reconsideration of Denial 
of Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, or in the Alternative to Preclude Counterclaim Plaintiffs from Seeking or Obtaining Any Interest in the Puhi Lot" entered by the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit.
1 
We have jurisdiction only to review paragraph nos. 2 
and 3 of the Order, which ordered Murayama to pay $6,887.43 in attorneys fees and costs to Kalani Construction Incorporated and 
Randal K. Miyashiro , Sr. within 30 days. See Harada v. Ellis, 60 
Haw. 467, 480, 591 P.2d 1060, 1070 (1979) (noting order for payment of discovery sanction enforceable through contempt proceedings was immediately appealable under collateral order doctrine). We review for abuse of discretion. Kaina v. Gellman , 
119 Hawai# i 324, 329, 197 P.3d 776, 781 (App. 2008). 
The Order did not state the authority for the circuit 
court's award of fees and costs, as required by Kaina , 119 
Hawai#i at 331, 197 P.3d at 783. 
If the circuit court relied on Hawai #i Rules of Civil 
Procedure ( HRCP) Rule 11, it did not follow the procedure 
prescribed by HRCP Rule 11(c)(1)(B). 
If the circuit court relied on its inherent power, it 
didn't make "a specific finding of bad faith." Kaina, 119 
Hawai
#i at 331, 197 P.3d at 783. The record does not show "clear 
evidence that the challenged actions [were] entirely without color, and [were] taken for reasons of harassment or delay or for other improper purposes[.]" Enos v. Pac. Transfer & Warehouse, 
Inc., 79 Hawai #i 452, 458, 903 P.2d 1273, 1279 (1995). The 
transcript of the May 12, 2021 hearing on Murayama's motion for reconsideration does not show "a high degree of specificity in the factual findings of the" circuit court. Id. 
1 The Honorable Kathleen N.A. Watanabe presided. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The circuit court acted outside of its discretion by 
assessing Kalani's and Miyashiro's attorneys fees and costs 
against Murayama without stating the authority for the award and either following the procedure under HRCP Rule 11(c)(1)(B) or making a specific finding of bad faith. Paragraph nos. 2 and 3 of the circuit court's June 4, 2021 Order are reversed.
