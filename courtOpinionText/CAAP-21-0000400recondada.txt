 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST 'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(Motion) from the Intermediate Court of Appeals Summary 
Disposition Order filed on December 30, 2024, pursuant to Hawai‘ i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 40, and the record and 
files herein, it appears that:  
(1) 
Collins does not "present new evidence and/or 
arguments that could not have been presented" earlier, Chen v. 
Mah, 146 Hawai‘ i 157, 172, 457 P.3d 796, 811 (2020) (citation 
omitted); 
(2) Collins does not present any point of law or 
fact that we overlooked or misapprehended. See HRAP Rule 40(b); 
and 
(3) 
Collins's argument that Associate Judge Hiraoka 
should have recused himself due to his former law firm's 
representation of a party in an unrelated 2013 lawsuit involving 
Collins, and that such alleged conflict of interest entitles her to reconsideration, lacks merit.
2 
Therefore, IT IS ORDERED that the Motion is denied. DATED: Honolulu, Hawaiʿi, January 15, 2025.   
/s/ Karen T. Nakasone  
Presiding Judge   
 
/s/ Sonja M.P. McCullen   
Associate Judge  
2 Collins's Motion was not filed under HRAP Rule 5 and in any event 
does not comply with that rule.
