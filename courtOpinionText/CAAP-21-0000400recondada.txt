APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1CC181000644) 
  
ORDER 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of self-represented Defendant-
Appellant Gabi K. Collins' (Collins) February 5, 2025 "Motion to 
Recuse and/or Disqualify Associate Judge Keith Hiraoka from 
Appellate Proceedings Due to Conflict of Interest and to Set 
Aside Summary Disposition Order and Judgment on Appeal Due to 
Appearance of Impropriety" (Motion), the papers in support, and the record, it appears that:   
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(1) Collins, inter alia, asks this court to set aside 
its December 30, 2024 Summary Disposition Order and January 31, 
2025 Judgment on Appeal; 
(2) Collins previously moved for reconsideration of 
the Summary Disposition Order, which this court denied; and 
(3) We construe Collins' Motion as a second motion 
for reconsideration of the Summary Disposition Order and a 
motion to set aside the Judgment on Appeal. Only one motion for 
reconsideration is permitted, see Hawai‘ i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure Rule 40(e), and Collins fails to demonstrate good 
cause to set aside the Judgment on Appeal. 
Therefore, IT IS ORDERED that Collins' Motion is 
denied as to Collins' request to reconsider the December 30, 2024 Summary Disposition Order and to set aside the January 31, 
2025 Judgment on Appeal, and denied as to all other requests not 
expressly addressed in this order, except for Collins' motion to 
disqualify or recuse Judge Keith K. Hiraoka, which is addressed 
in a separate order in which Judge Hiraoka did not participate.
