APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 5CC18-1-000083) NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and Nakasone, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of the Circuit Court of the Fifth 
Circuit's (circuit court) April 1, 2022 Response to Appellate 
Order for Temporary Remand; and Stipulation Regarding Order for 
Temporary Remand, it appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction over self-represented Plaintiff/Counterclaim Defendant-Appellant Scott Kuroiwa's appeal from the circuit court's June 7, 2021 judgment (Judgment), resolving Count I of the July 8, 2020 
Counterclaim by Defendants/Counterclaimants-Appellees Masakatsu 
Katsura, Mieko Katsura, and YMM LLC because the Judgment is not final and appealable or independently appealable, see Hawai# i 
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP
) Rule 54(b); Jenkins v. Cades 
Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai# i 115, 120, 869 P.2d 1334, 
1339 (1994); Greer v. Baker, 137 Hawai
#i 249, 253, 369 P.3d 832, 
836 (2016), HRS ยง 641-1(b) (2016), and the circuit court has indicated that the parties' remaining claims and counterclaims remain active and there is no just reason to enter a final, appealable judgment under HRCP Rule 54(b) as to Count I of the Counterclaim. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions or 
stipulations are dismissed. 
DATED: Honolulu, 
Hawai#i, May 27, 2022.
