NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
NO. CAAP-21-0000408 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
IN THE MATTER OF THE MAXIMO P. ESTEBAN TRUST 
DATED MAY 20, 1993 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1TR121000204) 
ORDER 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and McCullen, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
appellate jurisdiction over Petitioners-Appellants 
Jean Esteban 
and Veronica Esteban's appeal from the Circuit Court of the First 
Circuit's "Order Granting in Part and Denying Part Remainder of 
'Petition for Stay Order'; to Remove Trustee; Liens; Hold the Funds and Place into the Maximo P. Esteban Estate; Compel Discovery of the P. No. 97-0596 Filed August 24, 2020," and "Order Granting Remainder of Petition for Authority to Distribute the Deposit Sum of $146,083.52, and to Sell Real Property, Filed August 6, 2020" (collectively, Orders), both filed on June 9, 
2021, because the circuit court has not entered a final, 
appealable judgment, and the Orders are not independently appealable. 
An aggrieved party cannot obtain appellate review of a 
circuit court's interlocutory orders in a civil case, under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-1(a) (2016), until the NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
circuit court has reduced its dispositive rulings to an 
appealable, final judgment under Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure 
Rule 58. Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai# i 
115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
Here, the circuit court 
has not entered a final, appealable judgment. 
Further, the Orders do not satisfy the requirements for 
appealability under the collateral-order doctrine or HRS ยง 641-1(b). See Greer v. Baker, 137 Hawai# i 249, 253, 369 P.3d 832, 
836 (2016) (reciting the requirements for appeals under the collateral-order doctrine); HRS ยง 641-1(b) (2016) (reciting the requirements for leave to file an interlocutory appeal). 
In addition, the Order is not independently appealable 
under the Forgay
 doctrine because it does not confirm the sale of 
the subject property (Property), direct the immediate 
distribution of sale proceeds, or direct Veronica to surrender 
her interest in the Property immediately. See Greer, 137 Hawai# i 
at 253, 369 P.3d at 836 (reciting the requirements for appeals under the Forgay doctrine). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
