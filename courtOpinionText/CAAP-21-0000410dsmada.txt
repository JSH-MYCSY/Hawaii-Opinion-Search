NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
NO. CAAP-21-0000410 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
WC, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
TC, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
(FC-D NO. 18-1-0355)  
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Hiraoka and McCullen, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
appellate jurisdiction over self-represented Defendant-Appellant
TC's (Wife) appeal from the Family Court of the Second Circuit's
(family court) June 23, 2021 Order Denying [Wife]'s May 19, 2021
Motion and Affidavit for Post-Decree Relief (Order Denying Post-
Decree Relief).  
  
Part (2) of the family court's December 5, 2019 Decree 
Granting Absolute Divorce and Awarding Child Custody (Decree), concerning "child custody, visitation, and support" is not final 
because although it decides child custody and visitation, it reserves the issue of child support.  
See Eaton v. Eaton, 7 Haw. 
App. 111, 118-19, 748 P.2d 801, 805 (1987); Ferreira v. Ferreira
, 
112 Hawai# i 225, 231, 145 P.3d 768, 774 (App. 2006).  Therefore, 
the Order Denying Post-Decree Relief, which denies Wife's request to modify the family court's visitation order but does not NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
resolve the issue of child support (which remains pending before 
the family court), is not an appealable post-Decree order. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed. 
DATED:  Honolulu, 
Hawai# i, February 4, 2022.
