OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
WC, Petitioner-Appellee, v.
TC, Respondent-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(FC-DA NO. 18-1-0361) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(
By: Ginoza, C.J., and Wadsworth and Nakasone, JJ.) 
Self-represented Respondent-Appellant TC (Mother) 
appeals from the "Six[th] Amended Order for Protection" (
Sixth 
Amended Order), entered in favor of Petitioner-Appellee WC 
(Father) on June 18, 2021, by the Family Court of the Second 
Circuit (Family Court).1/ Mother also claims to appeal from the 
"Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and Order" 
(FOFs/COLs/Order), entered on August 18, 2021, by the Family 
Court. 
On appeal, Mother appears to contend that the Family 
Court entered the Sixth Amended Order: (1) without the support 
of substantial evidence and in abuse of the court's discretion; (2) in violation of Mother's due process rights; and (3) in 
1/ The Honorable James R. Rouse presided. It appears that the Sixth
Amended Order, which mistakenly bears the filing date of June 18, 2020, was
signed on June 18, 2021, and filed on the same date.  
   
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
violation of evidentiary rules.2/ Mother does not challenge any 
specific FOFs or COLs made by the Family Court. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Mother's contentions as follows and affirm. 
I. Background 
On July 23, 2018, Father filed an ex parte petition for 
a temporary restraining order (TRO) against Mother pursuant to 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) Chapter 586. Father declared under 
penalty of perjury that Mother had committed acts of domestic 
abuse or threats of domestic abuse, including hitting Father in the face and punching him in the back of the head, and threatening to commit suicide in front of the parties' minor daughter. On July 23, 2018, the Family Court entered a TRO, finding in part that it was "necessary to prevent acts of abuse or recurrence of actual domestic abuse . . . ." 
As reflected in unchallenged FOF 1, and in the record, 
on July 27, 2018, following a show-cause hearing, the Family Court entered an Order for Protection (Order), ordering in part 
that Mother be restrained from committing further acts of abuse.
3/ 
2/ Mother's points of error, to the extent discernible, have been
restated and condensed for clarity. We note that Mother's opening brief fails
to comply in material respects with Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure
(HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4) and (7). Mother's "failure to comply with HRAP Rule
28(b)(4) is alone sufficient to affirm the [family] court's judgment." Morgan
v.
 Planning Dep't, Cty. of Kauai, 104 Hawai #i 173, 180, 86 P.3d 982, 989
(2004); see also HRAP Rule 28(b)(7) ("Points not argued may be deemedwaived."). 
Nevertheless, we have "consistently adhered to the policy of
affording litigants the opportunity 'to have their cases heard on the merits,where possible.'" Morgan, 104 Hawai #i at 180–81, 86 P.3d at 989–90 (quoting
O'Connor v. Diocese of Honolulu, 77 Hawai #i 383, 386, 885 P.2d 361, 364
(1994)). We thus address Mother's arguments to the extent discernible. 
3/ The Family Court further found that Mother's recent conduct
included psychological abuse that constituted "family violence" under HRS§ 571-2. We note that under HRS § 586-5.5(a) (2018), a protective order maybe issued when it is necessary to prevent "domestic abuse or a recurrence ofabuse[.]" The statutory definitions of "domestic abuse" (see HRS § 586-1(Supp. 2020)) and "family violence" are not coextensive. Here, it appearsthat the Family Court issued the Protective Order based on conduct thatconstituted domestic abuse and also included family violence. 
2   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
The following FOFs are also unchallenged on appeal: 
2. The Order was subsequently amended on September 21,
2018, October 18, 2018, January 14, 2019, and July 31,2019. The Order was extended for good cause by thisCourt on June 26, 2020 and is set to expire onJuly 27, 2021. [Mother] was then represented by[counsel]. 
3. After the Order was amended on January 14, 2019,[Mother] was alleged to have violated the Order onJanuary 26, 2019. The Order was then amended again onJuly 31, 2019, and [Mother] was once again alleged tohave violated the Order on February 27, 2020. 
4. Per Court records and [Mother's] testimony, thecharges for the alleged violations of the Order arestill pending before Judge Bissen in 2FFC-20-0000102and 2FFC-19-0000048. 
5. Additionally, per the Court's records and [Mother's]testimony, she has several felony charges, five (5)total consisting of (3) Class C felony counts in 2CPC17-0000244 before Judge Loo, and (1) Class B count and(1) Class C count in 2 CPC 17-0000114 before JudgeBissen that are pending resolution. 
6. Currently, [Father] has sole legal and physicalcustody of the minor child as ordered in 2DV181000355by order entered on July 31, 2019. Further, Courtrecords indicate that on June 14, 2021, [Mother] wasordered to have continued supervised visits with thechild because a change in visitation would not be inthe child's best interests as there was been no material change in the circumstances since the date ofthe last order entered in the matter. 
7. The Court finds that [Mother's] prior alleged non-compliance with the Order for Protection as well asher failure to address the charges against her for heralleged violation of the Order is good cause for theOrder for Protection to be extended. 
8. The Court finds that [Mother] has demonstrated acapacity for [sic] to disregard the orders of thisCourt. As a result, the Court also finds that theOrder for Protection is still necessary to preventdomestic abuse or recurrence of abuse. As a result,this Court may extend the Order for such further fixedreasonable period as the Court deems appropriatepursuant to [HRS] § 586-5.5(b).

4/ We note that FOFs 7 and 8 actually present mixed determinations of
fact and law.

II. Discussion 
A. Substantial Evidence 
Mother contends that the Sixth Amended Order "[w]as 
made without the support of substantial evidence" and "[w]as 
arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion." 
We review the Family Court's exercise of discretion as 
follows: 
[T]he family court possesses wide discretion in making its
decisions and those decision[s] will not be set aside unlessthere is a manifest abuse of discretion. Thus, we will notdisturb the family court's decisions on appeal unless thefamily court disregarded rules or principles of law orpractice to the substantial detriment of a party litigantand its decision clearly exceeded the bounds of reason. 
Fisher v. Fisher, 111 Hawai# i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 (2006) 
(quoting In re Doe, 95 Hawai# i 183, 189-90, 20 P.3d 616, 622-23 
(2001)). 
We review the Family Court's findings of fact for clear 
error and vacate only when "the record lacks substantial evidence 
to support the finding or, . . . despite substantial evidence in support of the finding, [we are] left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made." Id."'Substantial 
evidence' is credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion." Id.Unchallenged findings of fact are 
binding on the parties and this court. See In re Doe, 99 Hawai# i 
522, 538, 57 P.3d 447, 463 (2002). 
We likewise review 
conclusions of law that present mixed questions of fact and law for clear error. See Estate of Klink ex rel. Klink v. State, 113 
Hawai#i 332, 351, 152 P.3d 504, 523 (2007). 
Mother does not present any argument on her points of 
error (see
 HRAP Rule 28(b)(7)); however, she asserts in her 
"Statement of Facts" that "[t]he Court had all the information present to render a decision to allow some sort of respite from the TRO" and "dismissed [Mother's] success and progress in self-realization and rehabilitation." Father responds that the Family 
4  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Court "properly exercised its discretion to extend the Protective 
Order." 
HRS § 586-5.5(b) (Supp. 2021) provides: 
A protective order may be extended for a further fixed
reasonable period as the court deems appropriate, including,
in the case where a protective order restrains any partyfrom contacting, threatening, or physically abusing a minor,for a fixed reasonable period extending to a date after theminor has reached eighteen years of age. Upon applicationby a person or agency capable of petitioning under section586-3, the court shall hold a hearing to determine whetherthe protective order should be extended. In making a
determination, the court shall consider evidence of abuseand threats of abuse that occurred before the initial restraining order and whether good cause exists to extendthe protective order
. 
The extended protective order may include all orders
stated in the preceding restraining order and may providefurther relief as the court deems necessary to preventdomestic abuse or a recurrence of abuse, including ordersestablishing temporary visitation and custody with regard tominor children of the parties and orders to either or bothparties to participate in domestic violence interventionservices. The court may terminate the extended protectiveorder at any time with the mutual consent of the parties. 
(Emphases added.) 
Here, as reflected in FOFs 1 through 8, the Family 
Court considered the "evidence of abuse and threats of abuse that 
occurred before the initial restraining order and whether good cause exist[ed] to extend the protective order." HRS § 586-5.5(b). The Family Court cited, among other things, Mother's abusive conduct that led to the initial order for protection, her alleged non-compliance with subsequent amended orders for protection, and her "demonstrated capacity . . . to disregard the orders of this court." Mother has not challenged any of the Family Court's related findings, which are thus binding on appeal (see supra) and support the Family Court's conclusions in FOFs 7 and 8 that there was good cause to extend the protective order.
5/ 
5/ In COLs 4 through 6, the Family Court also concluded that Father
established a material change of circumstances after issuance of the June 26,
2020 Order for Protection, pursuant to HRS § 586-9 (2018). The applicablestandard in these circumstances, however, was the "good cause" standard setforth in HRS § 586-5.5(b), which the court properly applied in FOFs 7 and 8.To the extent the Family Court erred in relying on HRS § 586-9, we concludethat such error was harmless. 
5  
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
In asserting that the Family Court "had all the 
information . . . to allow some sort of respite from the TRO" and
disregarded Mother's "progress in self-realization and rehabilitation[,]" Mother appears to dispute the weight of the evidence. It is well-settled, however, that "an appellate court will not pass upon issues dependent upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence; this is the province of 
 
the trier of fact." Fisher, 111 Hawai# i at 46, 137 P.3d at 360 
(quoting Doe, 95 Hawai# i at 190, 20 P.3d at 623). Moreover, 
Mother does not point to any evidence in the record supporting 
her assertions or provide any argument as to why any of the FOFs or mixed FOFs/COLs were clearly erroneous. See HRAP Rule 
28(b)(7). 
Accordingly, we conclude that the FOFs/COLs/Order and 
the Sixth Amended Order were supported by substantial evidence, and we are not left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. We further conclude that the Family Court did not abuse its discretion in entering the Sixth Amended Order. 
B. Due Process 
Mother contends: 
The Due Process clauses [sic] of the United States
Constitution encourages courts to decide a case that couldadversely affect a party's interest in the light deemedfundamental or natural. To satisfy this requirement, allevidence must be viewed in a light equal to both parties andall permissible inferences must be reasonably calculated andentered into the record properly. 
Mother further asserts that "El v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000) 
settles that the state court cannot interfere by allocating children without a high standard of proof that one parent is unfit."
6/ 
However, Mother fails to specify where in the record 
she brought the alleged error to the attention of the Family 
6/ It appears that Mother is referring to Troxel v. Granville, 530
U.S. 57 (2000), in which the United States Supreme Court affirmed the
Washington Supreme Court's judgment that a Washington visitation statuteviolated the United States Constitution. Id. at 63.

Court, and makes no discernible argument as to how the Sixth 
Amended Order violated her due process rights. Her argument is thus deemed waived. See HRAP Rule 28(b)(4) and (7); Ito v. 
Investors Equity Life Holding Co., 135 Hawai# i 49, 74, 346 P.3d 
118, 143 (2015) ("Where an appellant makes general assertions of a due process violation, without further elaboration or citation to authority, the court cannot reach a reasoned conclusion, and the due process argument is deemed waived." (citing Cty. of Hawaii v. C & J Coupe Family Ltd. P'ship, 119 Hawai# i 352, 373, 
198 P.3d 615, 636 (2008)); State v. Moses, 102 Hawai# i 449, 456, 
77 P.3d 940, 947 (2003) ("As a general rule, if a party does not raise an argument at trial, that argument will be deemed to have been waived on appeal[.]"). 
C. Evidentiary Rules 
Mother contends that "Hawaii Rules of Evidence [(HRE)] 
626 were not followed . . . relating to the mindset of [Mother] 
. . . ."
7/ She also asserts that "[m]uch of [Father's] filings 
proffered were irrelevant, . . . were entered into the record erroneously[, and] were unfairly prejudicial, confusing, and based on hearsay." 
However, Mother fails to set forth the substance of the 
evidence she claims was improperly admitted or rejected, fails to identify the evidentiary rule or rules she claims were violated, fails to specify where in the record, and on what grounds, she objected, and fails to make any discernible argument regarding her contentions. See HRAP Rule 28(b)(4) and (7). Her 
contentions based on alleged evidentiary violations are therefore deemed waived. See In re Guardianship of Carlsmith, 113 Hawai# i 
236, 246, 151 P.3d 717, 727 (2007) (an appellate court "may disregard a particular contention if the appellant makes no discernible argument in support of that position" (quoting Norton v. Admin. Dir. of the Court, 80 Hawai# i 197, 200, 908 P.2d 545, 
548 (1995)) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)); 
7/ There is no HRE Rule 626. It appears that Mother may be referring
to HRS chapter 626, which sets forth the Hawai #i Rules of Evidence.

Moses, 102 Hawai# i at 456, 77 P.3d at 947; HRAP Rule 28(b)(7) 
("Points not argued may be deemed waived."). 
III. Conclusion 
For the reasons discussed above, the "Six[th] Amended 
Order for Protection," entered on June 18, 2021, by the Family 
Court of the Second Circuit, is affirmed.
