AZIZI KAIAMA, Respondent-Appellant, 
v. 
TODD BOYD, Petitioner-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
WAILUKU DIVISION 
(CASE NO. 2DSS-21-0000115) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Hiraoka and McCullen, JJ.) 
Self-represented Respondent-Appellant Azizi 
Kaiama 
appeals from the "Order Granting Petition for Injunction Against 
Harassment" entered by the District Court of the Second Circuit, 
Wailuku Division, on July 12, 2021.1  For the reasons explained 
below, we affirm the Injunction. 
Petitioner-Appellee Todd Boyd filed a "Petition for Ex 
Parte Temporary Restraining Order and for Injunction Against Harassment" against Kaiama on April 21, 2021.
2  A "Temporary 
Restraining Order Against Harassment" was entered on April 21, 
1 The Honorable Douglas J. Sameshima presided. 
2 Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) ยง 604-10.5 (2016 & Supp. 2021)
authorizes the district court to enjoin harassment. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2021.3  An evidentiary hearing was held on July 12, 2021.  The 
following exchange took place: 
THE COURT:  Okay.  So wait, wait.  Wait, wait, wait. 
So your request is to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.  Is 
that what you're saying? 
MS. KAIAMA:  Yes, vacate order because they are
trespassing on crown land. 
The district court denied Kaiama's request to dismiss 
and heard testimony from Boyd.  Kaiama declined to be sworn in, 
stating, "I am a royal and this is a domestic courtroom and my rights have been violated."  She did not call any witnesses or present any evidence.  The district court ruled: 
As to today's proceeding, the Court is going to find that
the petitioner has presented clear and convincing evidencethat harassment, that is an intentional or knowing course ofconduct directed at an individual that seriously alarms ordisturbs consistently and continually bothers the individualserves no legitimate purpose --
MS. KAIAMA:  I live on the property --
THE COURT:  -- provided, ah, such conduct would cause
a reasonable person to suffer emotional distress. 
The Petition was granted.  The Injunction was entered 
on July 12, 2021.  This appeal followed.4 
We discern Kaiama's argument to be that the district 
court had no jurisdiction over her because she is descended from 
Hawaiian royalty, and Boyd was trespassing on royal lands.  The Hawai# i Supreme Court has held: 
[W]hatever may be said regarding the lawfulness of its
origins, the State of Hawai #i is now a lawful government. 
Individuals claiming to be citizens of the Kingdom and notof the State are not exempt from application of the State'slaws. 
3 The Honorable Michelle L. Drewyer presided. 
4 Kaiama's opening brief does not comply with Rule 28(b) of the 
Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure.  Nevertheless, the Hawai #i Supreme Court
instructs that to promote access to justice, pleadings prepared by self-represented litigants should be interpreted liberally, and self-representedlitigants should not automatically be foreclosed from appellate review becausethey fail to comply with court rules.  Erum v. Llego
, 147 Hawai #i 368, 380-81, 
465 P.3d 815, 827-28 (2020).

State v. Kaulia , 128 Hawai# i 479, 487, 291 P.3d 377, 385 (2013) 
(cleaned up).  Kaiama does not contend, nor does the record 
establish, that the evidence was insufficient to support the district court's decision, or that the district court misapplied the law. 
For the foregoing reasons, the Injunction entered by 
the district court on July 12, 2021, is affirmed. 
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, June 16, 2022.
