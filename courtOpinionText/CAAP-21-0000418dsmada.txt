IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
MATTHAN PATTIOAY, Defendant-Appellant. 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CR NO. 1PC161001676 (S.P.P. NO. 1PR101000015)) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Hiraoka, JJ.)  
Upon review of the document filed in this court by 
self-represented Defendant-Appellant Matthan Pattioay (
Pattioay), 
apparently challenging a judgment entered in circuit court 
criminal case number 1PC161001676, it appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-1(a) (2016) and Hawai# i Rules of Penal Procedure 
(HRPP) Rule 40(h) because there is no judgment in the record from 
which Pattioay can presently appeal. 
On May 8, 2018, this court entered a Summary 
Disposition Order in CAAP-17-0000465 that affirmed a May 17, 2017
judgment (Judgment) in criminal case number 1PC161001676 against 
Pattioay for terroristic threatening in the first degree, in  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
violation of HRS ยง 707-716 (2014). On July 16, 2021, Pattioay 
filed a "Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner from Custody" (7/16/21 Petition) as to the 
Judgment with the Appellate Clerk's Office, which created this 
appeal, appellate court case number CAAP-21-0000418. The appellate clerk then forwarded the 7/16/21 Petition to the circuit court. In both cases, the clerks uploaded the 7/16/21 Petition into the Judiciary Electronic Filing System as a "notice of appeal" rather than an HRPP Rule 40 petition. 
Under "HRPP [Rule] 40(h), appeals from proceedings for 
post-conviction relief may be made from a judgment entered in the proceeding and must be taken in accordance with Rule 4(b) of the Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP)." Grattafiori v. 
State, 79 Hawai# i 10, 13, 897 P.2d 937, 940 (1995) (internal 
quotation marks and brackets omitted). 
However, the circuit 
court has not entered any orders, much less a final judgment, on the 7/16/21 Petition. Absent a final order or judgment that is appealable under HRS 641-1(a), we lack appellate jurisdiction, and this appeal must be dismissed. 
Pattioay's 7/16/21 Petition appears to be, in 
substance, a non-conforming petition for post-conviction relief from the May 17, 2017 Judgment, under HRPP Rule 40(c)(2), which provides: 
(2) Nonconforming Petition. Where a post-conviction
petition deviates from the form annexed to these rules, it
shall nevertheless be accepted for filing and shall betreated as a petition under this rule provided that thepetition (i) claims illegality of a judgment or illegalityof "custody" or "restraint" arising out of judgment, (ii) isaccompanied by the necessary filing fee or by a well-foundedrequest to proceed without paying filing fees, and (iii)meets minimum standards of legibility and regularity. 
When treating a nonconforming petition as a petition
under this rule, the court shall promptly clarify by writtenorder that the requirements of this rule apply and, if theinformation in the petition is incomplete, may require thepetitioner to file a supplemental petition in the formannexed to these rules before requiring the state torespond. 
(Emphasis added.) Under these circumstances, it is appropriate 
for the circuit court to adjudicate Pattioay's non-conforming HRPP Rule 40(c)(2) petition for post-conviction relief in a special proceeding. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED as follows: 
1. CAAP-21-0000418 is dismissed for lack of appellate 
jurisdiction. 
2. All motions in CAAP-21-0000418 are dismissed as 
moot.1 
3. Pattioay's 7/16/21 Petition filed in this court as 
a "notice of appeal" is deemed to be a non-conforming HRPP Rule 40(c)(2) petition for post-conviction relief from the May 17, 2017 Judgment of conviction, and thus, the Circuit Court of the First Circuit shall open a separate special proceeding for the purpose of adjudicating Pattioay's July 16, 2021 non-conforming HRPP Rule 40(c)(2) petition. 
4. Upon entry of this order, the Appellate Court Clerk 
shall transmit copies of this order and Pattioay's 7/16/21 Petition filed in CAAP-21-0000418 to the Circuit Court of the First Circuit. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, January 7, 2022.
