STATE OF HAWAI‘I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v. 
QUINCY K. BECK, Defendant-Appellant. 
 
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
HANA DIVISION 
(CASE NO. 2DCW-21-0000403) 
  
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Wadsworth and McCullen, JJ.)
 
 
  Defendant-Appellant Quincy K. Beck (Beck) appeals from 
the District Court of the Second Circuit's  July 2, 2021 
Judgment; Notice of Entry (
Judgment) convicting Beck of Criminal 
Trespass in the Second Degree, in violation of Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS) § 708-814(1)(b) (Supp. 2019).  On appeal, Beck 
raises two points of error, challenging the sufficiency of the 
charge and sufficiency of the evidence. 1

   Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve the 
points of error as discussed below. 
(1) In the first point of error, Beck contends that  
the State "failed to provide [him] with adequate notice of the elements and essential facts of the offense of Criminal Trespass 
[i]n [t]he Second Degree because the Complaint and oral charge 
failed to provide the meaning of 'reasonable warning or request' 
as that phrase is expressly defined by HRS § 708-814(1)(b)."  
Beck argues that the charge "did not specify that Beck must be 
served, within the past year, with a written warning or request 
to leave." 
The State acknowledges that "[t]he lack of [a 
statutory] definition rendered the charge fatally defective[.]"    
See Territory v. Kogami, 37 Haw. 174, 175 (Haw. Terr. 1945) 
(holding that, while a prosecutor's concession of error is 
"entitled to great weight," before a conviction is reversed, "it 
is incumbent upon the appellate court to ascertain first that 
the confession of error is supported by the record and well-
founded in law and to determine that such error is properly 
preserved and prejudicial"). 
  "[A]n oral charge or complaint must sufficiently 
allege all of the essential elements of the offense."  State v. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 Sprattling, 99 Hawai‘ i 312, 318, 55 P.3d 276, 282 (2002) 
(internal quotation marks omitted); State v. Jendrusch, 58 Haw. 
279, 281, 567 P.2d 1242, 1244 (1977).  In addition, "[a] 
complaint . . . cannot reasonably be construed to charge an 
offense if it omits an element of the offense or when the common 
definition of an element of an offense set forth in the charge 
does not comport with its statutory definition."  State v. 
Baker, 146 Hawai‘ i 299, 308, 463 P.3d 956, 965 (2020) (citations 
omitted).  We review the sufficiency of a charge de novo.  State 
v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai‘ i 383, 390, 219 P.3d 1170, 1177 (2009) 
(citation omitted). 
  HRS § 708-814(1)(b) defines "reasonable warning or 
request" as a "warning or request communicated in writing at any 
time within a one-year period."  This definition does not 
comport with its common meaning because a reasonable person 
would not assume that the warning requires a writing within a 
one-year period.  See State v. King, 139 Hawai‘ i 249, 254, 386 
P.3d 886, 891 (2016) (explaining that "[a] 'reasonable warning or request' is then given a specialized meaning that applies 
only '[f]or the purposes of this paragraph'" (some brackets in 
original)).  
Thus, the failure to provide the statutory definition 
of reasonable warning or request in the complaint and oral 
charge "amounted to an omission of an entire element of the NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
 
4 
 offense."  See State v. Kauhane, 145 Hawai‘ i 362, 373, 452 P.3d 
359, 370 (2019) (holding that the State's failure to include the 
statutory definition of "obstructs" in its charge, as defined by 
HRS § 711-1100 (2014), rendered the charge insufficient because 
the statutory definition does not comport with its common 
definition); State v. Cavness, 80 Hawai‘ i 460, 464, 911 P.2d 95, 
99 (App. 1996) (explaining that "reasonable warning or request" 
is an element of Criminal Trespass in the Second Degree). 
(2) In his second point of error, Beck contends 
"[t]he district court reversibly erred by finding that the State 
presented sufficient evidence to prove Beck trespassed on 
'commercial premises.'"  Beck argues that "[t]here is no 
evidence, let alone substantial evidence, the Church received 
money from the food truck operators or their customers."  
[E]vidence adduced in the trial court must be considered in 
the strongest light for the prosecution when the appellate 
court passes on the legal sufficiency of such evidence to 
support a conviction . . . .  The test on appeal is not 
whether guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt, but 
whether there was substantial evidence to support the 
conclusion of the trier of fact.  
State v. Kalaola, 124 Hawai‘ i 43, 49, 237 P.3d 1109, 1115 (2010) 
(citations omitted and emphasis added).  In Cavness, the court 
defined "'commercial property' as '[i]ncome producing property 
(e.g., office buildings, apartments, etc.) as opposed to 
'residential property.'"  80 Hawai‘ i at 466, 911 P.2d at 101 
(citation omitted). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

   Here, the State's witness testified that the food 
trucks that reside on church property actively collect money and 
pay rent, providing supplemental income for the church.  Viewing 
this testimony in the light most favorable to the State, 
substantial evidence existed to support the conclusion that the 
food truck lot was an income producing property and, thus, a 
"commercial premises."  See Kalaola, 124 Hawai‘ i at 49, 237 P.3d 
at 1115.  Therefore, sufficient evidence existed as to the 
commercial premises element.   
  For the above reasons, we vacate the district court's 
July 2, 2021 Judgment, and remand for further proceedings 
consistent with this summary disposition order.
