Upon review of the record, it appears that:

Appellant Olga Vladimirovna Bordenyuk (Bordenyuk) filed the notice of appeal; 
(2) On August 13, 2021, the district court clerk filed 
the record on appeal, and the appellate clerk notified the parties that the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief were due on or before August 23, 2021, and September 22, 2021, respectively; 
(3) Bordenyuk failed to file either document or request 
an extension of time; 
(4) On September 29, 2021, the appellate clerk entered 
a default notice informing Bordenyuk that the time for filing the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief had expired, the matter would be called to the court's attention on October 11, 2021, for appropriate action, which could include dismissal of the appeal, under 
Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Rules 12.1(e) and 30, and Bordenyuk could request relief from 
default by motion; 
(5) The appellate clerk mailed the notice of entering 
case on calendar and the default notice to Bordenyuk at her address indicated on the notice of appeal and record on appeal, but both documents were returned.  The appellate clerk also mailed the default notice to another address for Bordenyuk found in the district court record, which was not returned; and 
(6) Bordenyuk has not filed a notice of change of 
address, consistent with HRAP Rule 25(f), or taken any further action in this appeal. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed.
