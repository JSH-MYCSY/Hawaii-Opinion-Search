 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Plaintiff's Motion to Confirm Partition Sale and (2) January 13, 
2021 Order on Commissioner's Request for Instructions from the 
Court Regarding Proposed Private Sale.1 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve this 
appeal as discussed below, and affirm. 
(1) The Espinda Family contends the circuit court 
"erred in (1) failing to require the properties to be sold by 'private sale' and (2) confirming the sale of the subject 
properties where the properties were sold by auction, and not by 
private sale, as required by the Final Judgment and Decree and 
First Amended Final Judgment and Decree." (Some formatting 
altered.) 
The First Amended Final Judgment and Decree noted two 
of the properties at issue "will be sold at private sale[,]" and 
directed the parties to "select a real estate broker to list for a period of one year the two parcels for sale." The First 
Amended Final Judgment and Decree also provided, "[i]f after six 
months the property has not sold, the parties agree to meet and 
negotiate in good faith to determine how and whether the real 
estate listing will be changed."

the Honorable Blaine J. Kobayashi entered the June 22, 2021 order.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
At most, the First Amended Final Judgment and Decree 
required private marketing for one year, and negotiations within 
six months if a sale did not occur. The First Amended Final 
Judgment and Decree did not prohibit a partition by sale. 
By the time the circuit court ordered a partition by 
sale, a broker selected by the Commissioner had listed the 
properties for private sale on three separate occasions, 
including two separate one-year periods. And, two other brokers the parties agreed upon listed the properties for sale on 
January 5, 1995, but their listing expired and the parties were 
unable to agree upon a new list price or whether to continue 
using the same brokers. Under these circumstances, the 
requirements of the First Amended Final Judgment and Decree were 
not violated, and the circuit court did not err in ordering a 
partition by sale. 
(2) The Espinda Family also contends the circuit 
court "erred in confirming the sale of the subject properties, because the price obtained at the judicial sale was inadequate." 
To support this contention, the Espinda Family relies on an 
appraisal they obtained as of May 7, 2021 determining the market 
value to be $985,000 and the Commissioner's assertion that he 
located a new broker willing to re-list the properties for about 
$700,000. 
3   
 
   Given the lengthy period of time the parties attempted 
to negotiate a private sale, and the $410,000 highest offer 
received while the properties were privately marketed, the 
$380,000 confirmed price does not shock the conscience.

a price below fair market value as a result of the forced nature 
of the sale); Sugarman v. Kapu, 104 Hawai

be set aside where the inadequacy [of price] is so gross as to 
shock the conscience") (citation and internal quotation marks
