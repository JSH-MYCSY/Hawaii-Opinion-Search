NO. CAAP-21-0000430 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I  
SALDY MARZAN, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAII, Respondent-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(SPP NO. 1CPN-21-0000018) 
ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL 
(By: Nakasone, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of Respondent-Appellee State of 
Hawaii's September 15, 2021 Motion to Dismiss for Lack of 
Appellate Jurisdiction, the papers in support, the record, and there being no opposition, it appears that we lack jurisdiction over self-represented Petitioner-Appellant Saldy Marzan's (Marzan) appeal, which is premature. 
Marzan states that he appeals from "an order 
denying/dismissing his Rule 40 Petition under SPP No. 1CPN-210000018 Filed in this court on 3-14-2021," by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit court). However, no such order 
appears in the record. 
"The right of appeal in a criminal case is purely 
statutory and exists only when given by some constitutional or 
statutory provision." State v. Poohina
, 97 Hawai# i 505, 509, 40 
P.3d 907, 911 (2002) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 641-11 (2016) and "HRPP [Hawai# i Rules of Penal Procedure] [Rule] 40(h), 
appeals from proceedings for post-conviction relief may be made from a judgment entered in the proceeding[.]" 
Grattafiori v. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
State, 79 Hawai# i 10, 13, 897 P.2d 937, 940 (1995) (internal 
quotation marks and brackets omitted). 
Here, on March 14, 2021, in the underlying case, 1CPN-
21-0000018, the circuit court clerk electronically filed Marzan's 
Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner from Custody, under HRPP Rule 40 (Petition).  The 
circuit court has not issued an order or judgment disposing of 
the Petition, and there is no circuit court ruling that could be the subject of the appeal. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion to 
dismiss the appeal is granted, and the appeal is dismissed. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are 
dismissed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, October 12, 2021.
