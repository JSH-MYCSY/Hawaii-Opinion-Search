APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 2CC101000507) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Michael Jon Szymanski  appeals from the April 30, 2021
Amended Judgment  entered by the Circuit Court of the Second 
Circuit.  We affirm the July 5, 2017 "Order Granting Plaintiff's 
Non-Hearing Motion to Clarify Order of Dismissal" ( Order No. 1 ) 
and the April 14, 2021 "Amended Findings of Fact, Conclusions of 
Law and Order Denying Defendant Szymanski's Non-Hearing Motion to Set Aside the 7/5/2017 Order Granting Plaintiff's Non-Hearing Motion to Clarify Order of Dismissal" ( Order No. 2 ). But we 
reverse the April 6, 2021 Judgment  for Aurora  Loan Services LLC 1
1 The Honorable Peter T. Cahill presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and the Amended Judgment because Aurora's foreclosure claim was 
never adjudicated on the merits. 
Aurora filed a foreclosure complaint against Szymanski 
on August 11, 2010. Attached were copies of a promissory note and mortgage for property in Wailea, Maui, and a December 19, 2008 notice of default mailed to Szymanski at a Salt Lake City, Utah address. 
A return purporting to show personal service on 
Szymanski at the Wailea address was filed on September 8, 2010. The return was not acknowledged; the process server wrote: "Refused to sign â€” very uncooperative[.]" Szymanski's default was entered on October 6, 2010. 
Aurora did not file a pretrial statement. 
On 
November 3, 2011, an Order of Dismissal  was entered under 
Rule 12(q) of the Rules of the Circuit Courts of the State of 
Hawai#i (RCCH).2 Aurora did not move to set aside the Order of 
Dismissal. No judgment was entered. 
On June 20, 2017, Aurora moved for clarification that 
the Order of Dismissal was without prejudice. The motion was served on Szymanski by mail to the Wailea address. Order No. 1 granting Aurora's motion was entered on July 5, 2017. 
We take judicial notice
3 that Deutsche Bank  Trust 
Company Americas filed a foreclosure complaint against Szymanski on January 11, 2018. Deutsche Bank claimed to be the holder of Szymanski's note and the assignee of the mortgage on the Wailea property. 
Szymanski moved to set aside Order No. 1 on December 2, 
2019. He signed a declaration stating he was never served with Aurora's complaint or its motion for clarification. He submitted copies of account statements from 2017 that had been mailed to him in Utah to show Aurora knew where he lived. An evidentiary hearing was held on October 23, 2020. The Judgment was entered

2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
on April 6, 2021. Order No. 2 denying Szymanski's motion to set 
aside was entered on April 14, 2021. The Amended Judgment was entered on April 30, 2021. This appeal followed. 
Szymanski states eight overlapping points of error. 
The primary issue is whether the circuit court erred by clarifying that the Order of Dismissal was without prejudice. We review for abuse of discretion. Ryan v. Palmer
, 130 Hawai#i 321, 
323, 310 P.3d 1022, 1024 (App. 2013). 
RCCH Rule 12(q) (2011) provided: 
Dismissal for want of prosecution . An action may be
dismissed sua sponte with written notice to the parties if a
pretrial statement has not been filed within 8 months aftera complaint has been filed (or within any further period ofextension granted by the court) or if a trial setting statusconference has not been scheduled as required by Rule 12(c).Such dismissal may be set aside and the action reinstated byorder of the court for good cause shown upon motion dulyfiled not later than ten (10) days from the date of theorder of dismissal. 
Former RCCH Rule 12(q) didn't specify whether a 
dismissal for failure to file a pretrial statement was with or 
without prejudice. The Order of Dismissal didn't state whether the dismissal was with or without prejudice. The record does not show "a deliberate attempt to delay or actions [by Aurora] rising to the level of contumacious conduct, and the circuit court did not make any such finding." Ryan, 130 
Hawai#i at 324, 310 P.3d 
at 1025. No judgment was entered on the Order of Dismissal. Under these circumstances, the matter was not finally adjudicated on the merits, and the dismissal was without prejudice. Saplan v. U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n, 154 Hawai #i 181, 188-89, 549 P.3d 266, 
273-74 (2024). The circuit court did not abuse its discretion by clarifying that the Order of Dismissal was entered without prejudice. However, the circuit court erred by entering the Judgment and the Amended Judgment because there was no adjudication on the merits of Aurora's foreclosure claim. 
Szymanski argues his default should not have been 
entered because he was never served with Aurora's foreclosure complaint. 
He is not prejudiced by the entry of default because 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Aurora's claim was never adjudicated on the merits and we are 
reversing the Judgment and Amended Judgment. 
Szymanski argues the dismissal without prejudice 
prejudiced him because he has to defend against Deutsche Bank's foreclosure action. The argument is not persuasive. Having to defend a lawsuit without the benefit of res judicata for a claim that was never decided on the merits is not prejudice. Cf. Chen v. Mah, 146 
Hawai#i 157, 180 n.28, 457 P.3d 796, 819 n.28 (2020) 
("The mere fact that the nondefaulting party will be required to prove his case without the inhibiting effect of the default upon the defaulting party does not constitute prejudice which should prevent a reopening."). 
Szymanski's argument that he was prejudiced by 
"Aurora's unreasonable and ridiculously-long 6 years of delay" is also not persuasive. 
There is no prejudice because Szymanski 
retained whatever defenses he may have had against Aurora to assert against Deutsche Bank, including laches. 
Szymanski's other points of error lack merit. We 
affirm the July 5, 2017 "Order Granting Plaintiff's Non-Hearing Motion to Clarify Order of Dismissal" and the April 14, 2021 "Amended Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Denying Defendant Szymanski's Non-Hearing Motion to Set Aside the 7/5/2017 Order Granting Plaintiff's Non-Hearing Motion to Clarify Order of Dismissal[.]" The April 6, 2021 Judgment and the April 30, 2021 Amended Judgment are reversed because Aurora's foreclosure claim was never adjudicated on the merits.
