APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 2CC181000015) 
ORDER 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
Upon review of the Motion for Reconsideration filed by 
Michael Jon Szymanski  on February 10, 2025, the papers in 
support, and the record, it appears that: 
1. Szymanski moves for reconsideration of our 
January 31, 2025 Summary Disposition Order; and 
2. The Motion for Reconsideration presents no point 
of law or fact we overlooked or misapprehended. See Rule 40(b), 
Hawai#i Rules of Appellate Procedure. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion for 
Reconsideration is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai#i, February 18, 2025.
