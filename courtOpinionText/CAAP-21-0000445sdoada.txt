v.

UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE DIVISION and Employment Security 
Appeals Referees Office, Agency-Appellee-Appellee,

STATE OF HAWAI# I, DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, Employer 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 3CCV-20-0000138) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By:  Leonard, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Nakasone, JJ.) 
This is a secondary appeal from a circuit court 
judgment affirming a decision by Agency-Appellee-Appellee State 
of Hawai# i Department of Labor and Industrial Relations (DLIR) 
denying a claim for unemployment insurance benefits made by self-represented Claimant-Appellant-Appellant Ross T. Nishi.  Nishi 
appeals from the Final Judgment entered by the Circuit Court of 
the Third Circuit on June 30, 2021.
1  For the reasons explained 
below, we affirm the Final Judgment. 
Nishi was employed by the State of Hawai# i Department 
of Education (DOE) as a Personnel Regional Officer.  In 2019 he 
was paid about $92,000. 
1 The Honorable Peter K. Kubota presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
He described his job: 
We do the hiring, firing, um, the background checks, the
grievances, um, pretty much everything when someone entersthe DOE.  I guess -- yeah, I guess, um, you know whensomeone enters the DOE, we do from the start to wheneverthey leave, yeah. 
. . . . 
. . .  So the hiring part.  If they -- if they had
misconduct or something like that we do a -- we assist with
the firing, yeah.  We draft all the letters and, you know,assist with the (unintelligible), right.  We (unintelligible). 
On December 12, 2019, Nishi signed a DOE Separation 
from Service form.  The form stated that Nishi was resigning from 
DOE because he had accepted another job at Hawai# i County. 
Nishi made a claim for unemployment insurance benefits 
with DLIR's Unemployment Insurance Division (
UID).  UID denied 
Nishi's claim under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 383-30(1) 
because he "quit without good cause." 
Nishi appealed.  He stated: "I did not have the 
opportunity to explain why I resigned from the DOE."  The DLIR 
Employment Security Appeals Referees' Office (ESARO) conducted a 
hearing on February 13, 2020.  Nishi testified at the hearing; he 
did not offer any documents as evidence.  On February 14, 2020, ESARO affirmed the denial of benefits. 
By letter dated February 21, 2020, Nishi requested that 
ESARO reopen his appeal.  He stated, "I resigned in lieu of termination."  He provided ESARO with copies of three letters. ESARO denied the request to reopen on March 2, 2020. 
On March 30, 2020, Nishi appealed to the circuit court. 
On June 30, 2021, the circuit court entered its "Order Affirming Employment Security Appeals Referees' Office's Decision in the Matter of 2000173 Dated February 14, 2020[,] and Denial of 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Reopening Dated March 2, 2020[,]" and the Final Judgment.  This 
appeal followed.2 
Our review of a circuit court decision on an appeal 
from an administrative agency determination is a secondary appeal; we must determine whether the circuit court was right or wrong in its decision, applying the standards set forth in HRS § 91–14(g) to the agency's decision.  Flores v. Bd. of Land & Nat. Res., 143 
Hawai# i 114, 120, 424 P.3d 469, 475 (2018).  Our 
review is confined to the record before the circuit court.  HRS § 91-14(f) (2012 & Supp. 2019).
3 
HRS § 91–14(g) (2012 & Supp. 2019) provides, in 
relevant part: 
Upon review of the record, the court may affirm the
decision of the agency or remand the case withinstructions for further proceedings; or it mayreverse or modify the decision and order if thesubstantial rights of the petitioners may have beenprejudiced because the administrative findings,conclusions, decisions, or orders are: 
(1) In violation of constitutional or 
statutory provisions; 
(2) In excess of the statutory authority or
jurisdiction of the agency; 
(3) Made upon unlawful procedure; 
(4) Affected by other error of law; 
(5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,
probative, and substantial evidence on the
whole record;  or 
2 Nishi's opening brief does not comply with Rule 28(b) of the 
Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure ( HRAP ).  Nevertheless, the Hawai #i Supreme
Court instructs that to promote access to justice, pleadings prepared by self-represented litigants should be interpreted liberally, and self-representedlitigants should not automatically be foreclosed from appellate review becausethey fail to comply with court rules.  Erum v. Llego
, 147 Hawai i # 368, 380-81, 
465 P.3d 815, 827-28 (2020). 
3 The appendix to Nishi's opening brief contains a copy of a letter
dated February 5, 2021, from the Hawai #i Civil Rights Commission to Nishi. 
The letter does not appear in the record on appeal.  We disregard it.  
See 
HRAP Rule 28(b)(10) ("Anything that is not part of the record shall not beappended to the brief[.]").

(6) Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized
by abuse of discretion or clearlyunwarranted exercise of discretion. 
"Under HRS § 91-14(g), conclusions of law are reviewable under 
subsections (1), (2), and (4); questions regarding procedural defects under subsection (3); findings of fact under subsection (5); and an agency's exercise of discretion under subsection (6)."  Del Monte Fresh Produce (Haw.), Inc. v. International Longshore & Warehouse Union, Local 142, 128 
Hawai# i 
289, 302, 287 P.3d 190, 203 (2012) (citations omitted). 
The first issue presented by Nishi's appeal is whether 
ESARO's decision of February 14, 2020, (which affirmed UID's denial of benefits) was erroneous.  The ESARO hearings officer made the following findings of fact: 
[Nishi] worked full-time for [DOE]'s school system from
November 1, 2004 to December 31, 2019, and most recently asa personnel regional officer II.  Effective December 31,2019, [Nishi]'s employment relationship with [DOE] ended. 
[Nishi]'s position as a personnel regional officer II
required him to supervise two clerks (Clerk 1 and Clerk 2). [DOE] held [Nishi] responsible for the work of Clerk 1 andClerk 2, who both helped him with the administration ofhiring and terminating [DOE]'s employees. 
[Nishi] attempted to improve Clerk 1's work performance for
approximately two years before the end of his employment. He was not successful.  Clerk 2 was a more recent hire. [Nishi] had no issue with Clerk 2's job performance. 
On December 12, 2019, [Nishi] last worked for [DOE].  He 
submitted his written resignation effective December 31,2019.  Ex. 7.[
4]  He stated he was leaving to accept another
job by checking off a box.  Ex. 7.  [Nishi] did not checkthe boxes indicating he was unable to meet the requirementsof his position or any of the boxes as to dissatisfactionwith his workplace environment (lack of administrativesupport, coworkers, or workload).  Ex. 7. 
After December 12, 2019, [Nishi] did not report for work and
instead used his sick leave.  [Nishi]'s employment ended on December 31, 2019. 
4 Exhibit 7 was the DOE Separation from Service form Nishi signed on
December 12, 2019. 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
We review findings of fact under the "clearly 
erroneous" standard.  A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when 
the record lacks substantial evidence to support the finding or when, despite some evidence to support the finding, we are left with the definite and firm conviction in reviewing all of the evidence that a mistake has been committed.  Birano v. State, 143 
Hawai# i 163, 181, 426 P.3d 387, 405 (2018).  "Substantial 
evidence" is "credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion."  In re Grievance Arbitration Between State of Hawai# i Organization of Police Officers and County of Kaua# i, 
135 Hawai# i 456, 462, 353 P.3d 998, 1004 (2015) (citation 
omitted).  
The ESARO hearings officer's findings of fact were 
supported by substantial evidence — the exhibits in evidence and Nishi's testimony — and were not clearly erroneous.  The hearings officer noted: 
There were issues of credibility regarding both parties,
especially considering [DOE] was not present at the appealhearing and [Nishi]'s testimony contradicted his writtenresignation.  There was also no written contemporaneousevidence of the alleged proceedings to discharge [Nishi] forpoor work performance in the record.  The only credible andreliable evidence as to whether continued work was available to [Nishi] was his written resignation.  [Nishi] submitted awritten resignation dated December 12, 2019 to accept
another job and his last day of employment would be
December 31, 2019.  He did not express any dissatisfactionwith his workplace environment or inability to do his job,despite an opportunity to simply check a box in his writtenresignation.  Furthermore, [Nishi] could have continued todispute the ending of his employment.  Hence, credibilitywas accorded to [Nishi]'s written resignation (Ex. 7) whichimplies continued work was available to [Nishi] had he notquit. 
Based on the foregoing, [Nishi] was the moving party and
ended the employment relationship. 
"A court reviewing an agency's decision cannot consider the 
weight of the evidence . . . or review the agency's findings of fact by passing upon the credibility of witnesses or conflicts in testimony, especially the finding of an expert agency in dealing 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
with a specialized field."  Sierra Club v. D.R. Horton-Schuler 
Homes, LLC, 136 Hawai# i 505, 522, 364 P.3d 213, 230 (2015) 
(cleaned up). 
The ESARO hearings officer found and concluded: 
Based on the foregoing, [Nishi] was the moving party and
ended the employment relationship.  The relevant issue then is whether [Nishi] left work for good cause. 
To establish good cause, [Nishi] must demonstrate he had
substantial or compelling reasons to quit, such that areasonable and prudent worker who genuinely and sincerelywanted to maintain employment would have taken similaraction.  Haw. Admin. R. § 12-5-47(c).  [Nishi] was alsoexpected to try reasonable alternatives. 
[Nishi] demonstrated unpleasant aspects of his job, but he
did not show good cause for quitting.  A reasonable and prudent worker, genuinely and sincerely desirous ofmaintaining employment would not quit his or her job beforeobtaining a firm offer of other employment.  [Nishi] was notadvised by a medical professional to quit his job. [Nishi]'s quitting was a disproportionate response to thealleged harm.  Moreover, [Nishi] is expected to attemptreasonable alternatives to quitting.  [Nishi] admitted hecould have continued disputing the ending of his employment. 
[Nishi]'s situation did not rise to the level or extent to
find he was compelled to quit, nor did the evidence show hehad substantial reasons for quitting and becoming totallyunemployed when he did.  [Nishi] also did not showsufficient credible evidence to find continued employmentwas unsuitable, unfavorable or unavailable to him.  Based on the foregoing, [Nishi] did not meet his burden of proof toestablish that he quit for good cause. 
We review conclusions of law under the "right/wrong" 
standard.  City & Cnty. of Honolulu v. Honolulu Police Comm'n, 
151 Hawai# i 56, 62, 508 P.3d 851, 857 (App. 2022).  A conclusion 
of law that is supported by the agency's findings of fact and reflects an application of the correct rule of law will not be overturned.  Id. When a conclusion of law presents mixed questions of fact and law, we review it under the "clearly erroneous" standard because the agency's conclusions are dependent on the facts and circumstances of each individual case. Id. 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRS § 383-30 (2015) provides, in relevant part: 
Disqualification for benefits .  An individual shall be 
disqualified for benefits: 
(1) Voluntary separation. . . .  For any week . . .
in which the individual has left the individual's work voluntarily without good 
cause , and continuing until the individual has,
subsequent to the week in which the voluntaryseparation occurred, been paid wages in coveredemployment equal to not less than five times theindividual's weekly benefit amount as determinedunder section 383-22(b). 
(emphasis added). 
Hawaii Administrative Rules § 12-5-47 provides, in 
relevant part: 
Voluntary Separation .  (a) An individual shall be
disqualified for benefits for voluntarily leaving workwithout good cause. 
(b) A separation is a voluntary  leaving or quitting
when the facts and circumstances demonstrate that a claimant is the "moving party" in the termination of an employmentrelationship. 
(c) Generally, a leaving of work is considered to be 
for good cause  where it is for a real, substantial, or
compelling reason, or a reason which would cause a
reasonable and prudent worker, genuinely and sincerely
desirous of maintaining employment, to take similar action. Such a worker is expected to try reasonable alternativesbefore terminating the employment relationship. 
(emphasis added).  Whether a separation is voluntary is a 
separate issue from whether the separation was for good cause. Hardin v. Akiba, 84 
Hawai# i 305, 313, 933 P.2d 1339, 1347 (1997).
The former is concerned with "whether the circumstances reflect an intent on the part of the employee to terminate employment." Id. (quoting Ipsen v. Akiba, 80 Hawai# i 481, 486, 911 P.2d 116, 
121 (App. 1996)).  The latter is concerned with "whether there were compelling reasons which forced an employee to leave[.]" Id. (citation omitted).  
ESARO's finding and conclusion that "[Nishi] was the 
moving party and ended the employment relationship" was supported by substantial evidence and reflected an application of the 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
correct rule of law.  ESARO's finding and conclusion that 
"[Nishi] did not meet his burden of proof to establish that he quit for good cause" was also supported by substantial evidence and reflected an application of the correct rule of law.  An agency's decision that is supported by its findings of fact and reflects an application of the correct rule of law will not be overturned.  Honolulu Police Comm'n, 151 
Hawai# i at 62, 508 P.3d 
at 857. 
The second issue presented by Nishi's appeal is whether 
ESARO's March 2, 2020 denial of Nishi's request to reopen his appeal was erroneous.  HRS § 383-38(b) (2015) provides, in relevant part: 
the referee may reopen the matter, upon the application of
the director or any other party, or upon the referee's own
motion, and thereupon may take further evidence or maymodify or reverse the referee's decision, findings, orconclusions. 
(emphasis added).  The Hawai# i Supreme Court has instructed: 
[W]hen reviewing a determination of an administrativeagency, we first decide whether the legislaturegranted the agency discretion to make thedetermination being reviewed.  If the legislature hasgranted the agency discretion over a particularmatter, then we review the agency's action pursuant tothe deferential abuse of discretion standard (bearingin mind the legislature determines the boundaries ofthat discretion). 
Paul's Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Befitel, 104 Hawai# i 412, 419-20, 91 
P.3d 494, 501-02 (2004).  Accordingly, we review for abuse of 
discretion. 
The additional evidence Nishi sought to introduce were 
DOE letters to Nishi dated October 17, 2019, and November 19, 2019, both of which could have been offered before the UID denied Nishi's claim, or during Nishi's appeal to ESARO.  Nishi also sought to introduce a letter from the Hawaii Government Employees Association/American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO (
HGEA).  The HGEA letter was dated 
February 19, 2020 (after the date of the ESARO appeal hearing), 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
but the contents of the letter concerned the circumstances of 
Nishi's resignation and could have been offered before the UID denied Nishi's claim, or during the ESARO appeal hearing.  We conclude that ESARO did not abuse its discretion by denying Nishi's request to reopen his appeal.  See Amfac, Inc. v. Waikiki Beachcomber Inv. Co., 74 Haw. 85, 115, 839 P.2d 10, 27 (1992) (holding that trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying motion for reconsideration where movant's argument "could and should have been made . . . in support of its motion for summary judgment"). 
For the foregoing reasons, the circuit court was not 
wrong to affirm ESARO's decisions, and the Final Judgment entered on June 30, 2021, is affirmed.
