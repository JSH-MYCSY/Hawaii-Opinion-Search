APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 3CC16100342K) 
  
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Wadsworth, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
This appeal arises out of a grant of summary judgment 
on Plaintiff-Appellant Chang Y. Aiona, V's (Aiona) defamation 
claims in favor of Aiona's former employer Defendants-

Appellees County of Hawai‘ i (County) and John A. Medeiros 
(Medeiros) (collectively, Appellees
). Aiona's defamation claims 
arose out of his employment with the County's Department of 
Environment Management (DEM), during which he was investigated 
by Medeiros, who was the Deputy Director of DEM, for the alleged theft of HI-5 recycling containers and other recyclable material from County recycling stations. We affirm. 
Aiona appeals from the (1) May 25, 2021 "Findings of 
Fact [(FOFs)], Conclusions of Law [(COLs)] and Order Granting County Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment
, Filed January 
25, 2021" (Order Granting MSJ); and (2) July 7, 2021 "Final Judgment," both filed and entered by the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit (Circuit Court).
1 
On appeal, Aiona's points of error (POEs)2 (B)(1) 
through (B)(8) challenge various COLs the Circuit Court made in its Order Granting MSJ  on grounds that the COLs "misstated" or 
"misapplied" "the law of defamation." Aiona challenges the COLs for two categories of alleged defamation on appeal: (1) allegedly defamatory statements Medeiros made to DEM Human Resources Technician Brandyann Kerr (
Medeiros's statements to 
Kerr), and (2) alleged publication of defamatory statements by 3
1 The Honorable Wendy M. DeWeese presided. 
2 Aiona's POEs labeled (A)(1) through (A)(4) challenge various 
FOFs, but the Opening Brief contains no specific argument how these FOFs are
clearly erroneous. These challenges are waived. See Ass'n of Apartment 
Owners of Wailea Elua v. Wailea Resort Co., Ltd., 100 Hawai‘ i 97, 110, 58 P.3d 
608, 621 (2002) ("Where an appellant raises a point of error but fails to present any accompanying argument, the point is deemed waived." (citation 
omitted)); Hawai

County employees to the community (publication by County 
employees).4 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve Aiona's 
contentions as follows. 
On October 21, 2016, Aiona filed a Complaint against 
Appellees for defamation per se and per quod, and derivative claims of false light and intentional infliction of emotional distress. 
On January 25, 2021, Appellees filed a Motion for 
Summary Judgment (MSJ), arguing, inter alia, that the statements did not meet the first element of an actionable defamation claim because the "statements were not defamatory," as they "were true," and were "constitutionally protected opinion and rhetorical hyperbole." Appellees also argued that there was no evidence that either the County or Medeiros was responsible for 
any publication by County employees. 
Aiona opposed, arguing, inter alia, that statements 
made by the Appellees were not "true" and were not "rhetorical 
hyperbole"; that a jury should make the determination "if a statement can be interpreted as having both an innocent and a defamatory meaning"; and that the court was required to apply 
the applicable defamation caselaw for non-media or non-public 
figures. 
At the March 19, 2021 MSJ hearing, the Circuit Court 
orally granted the MSJ on the defamation claims because the 
4 While FOF 22 in the Order Granting MSJ set forth five categories 
of "alleged defamatory communications forming the subject matter of this 
action," the Opening Brief presents discernible argument for only two 
categories, to which we confine our review. See HRAP Rule 28(b)(7).

statements were "not false or defamatory" and did not establish 
the first element required for defamation.5 
On May 25, 2021, the Circuit Court filed its Order 
Granting MSJ, containing the COLs pertinent to this appeal. 
Aiona challenges COLs 18-27  relating to Medeiros's alleged 
defamatory statements to Kerr, and COLs 28-32,  relating to the 
alleged publication by County employees: 76
Protected Opinions and Rhetorical Hyperbole 
18. The United States Supreme Court has "'recognized
constitutional limits on the type of speech which may be 
subject to state defamation claims.'" Gold, 88 Hawaiʻi at 
101, 962 P.2d at 360
[.] 
19. Although state law primarily governs defamati
on, 
the First Amendment's safeguards for freedom of speech
limit state law. New York Times v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 
264 (1964). New York Times v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 264 
(1964). 
20. While opinions and rhetorical hyperbole are
protected by the First Amendment, a statement that implies "a false assertion of fact" is actionable. Milkovich v. 
Lorain Journal Co., 497 U.S. 1, 19 (1990); see also Partington v. Bugliosi, 56 F.3d 1147, 1153 (9th Cir. 1995). 
21. First Amendment protection for opinions extends
to non-media defendants. Williams v. Kanemaru, No. 
CAAP-11-0000419, 130 Hawaiʻ i 304, 309 P.3d 972, 2013 WL 
4458887, *2 (Haw. Ct. App. Aug. 20, 2013); 
see, e.g., 
5 A plaintiff must establish the following four elements in order 
to sustain a defamation claim: (1) "a false and defamatory statement concerning another"; (2) "an unprivileged publication to a third party";(3) "fault amounting at least to negligence on the part of the publisher 
[and] actual malice where the plaintiff is a public figure"; and (4) "eitheractionability of the statement irrespective of special harm or the existence 
of special harm caused by the publication." Gold v. Harrison, 88 Hawai‘i 94, 
100, 962 P.2d 
353, 359 (1998) (brackets and citation omitted). 
6 COL 27 ruled on six alleged defamatory statements to Kerr set
forth in COL 27(a) through (f), but Aiona presents argument only as to four 
statements to Kerr -- 27(a), (b), (d), and (e) -- to which we confine our 
review. 
7 Aiona presents no argument in his challenge to COLs 28 and 29,
which are statements of the law pertaining to publication. This challenge is waived. See HRAP Rule 28(b)(7). COL 32 relates to a category of statements
that we do not address.

Pages, Inc., 190 S.W.3d 899 (Tex. App. 2006). 
22. "Pure opinions are those that do not imply facts 
capable of being proved true or false." Partington, 56 F.3d

for an action of defamation, no matter how unjustified and 
unreasonable the opinion may be or how derogatory it is.'" 
[sic] Williams, 2013 WL 4458887 at *2 (quoting Restatement
§ 566 cmt. c). "The rationale behind this rule is that when the facts are disclosed, third parties, will understand
that they are hearing the defendant's 'interpretation of
the facts presented; they are therefore unlikely to 
construe the statement as insinuating the existence ofadditional, undisclosed facts.'" Williams, 2013 WL 4458887

1430, 1439 (9th Cir. 1995)). 
24. Rhetorical hyperbole is "figurative or hyperbolic
language that would negate the impression that a person was 
asserting an objective fact." Gold, 88 Hawaiʻi at 101, 962 
P.2d at 360. Courts define "rhetorical hyperbole" as lusty 
and imaginative expressions of contempt. Old Dominion Branch No. 496, Nat'l Ass'n of 
Letter Carriers, AFL- CIO v. 
Austin, 218 U.S. 264, 286 (1974); San Antonio Cmty. Hosp. 
v. S. Cal. Dist. Council of Carpenters, 137 F.3d 1090, 1091 
(9th Cir. 1998). 
25. "In reviewing a defamation claim, a court must 
ask as a threshold 
matter whether a reasonable factfinder 
could conclude that the contested statement implies an assertion of objective fact." Partington, 56 F.3d at 1153 
(internal quotation marks and brackets and citation 
omitted); Wilson, 121 Hawaiʻ i at 128, 214 P.3d at 1118 
(quotation marks and citation omitted). "If the answer is 
no, the claim is foreclosed

Gold, 88 Hawaiʻ i at 101, 962 P.2d at 360 (italics in
original; citation and brackets omitted). 
27. Under the Gold test, the following statements are 
not false and defamatory as a matter of law because their general tenor negates the impression the speaker was
asserting an objective fact; instead, they are rhetorical 
hyperbole or opinion, not susceptible of being proved true
or false, and incapable of the defamatory meaning [Aiona] ascribes to them and, therefore, they are not actionable, 
see Underwager v . Channel 9 Australia, 69 F.3d 361, 366- 67

the community at large that [Aiona]'s "job was at jeopardy
as he was accused of stealing HI- 5 recyclables," and that 
"he might get terminated from his position," FOF No. 22.i,

evidence Mr. Medeiros or any other County employee was responsible for the spread of rumors to the public at

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the rumor precludes [Aiona]'s defamation claim against 
County Defendants based on that alleged statement. See 
Illaraza v. Hovensa LLC, 73 F.Supp.3d 588, 606 (D.V.I.
2014). Thus, [Aiona]'s conjecture that County employees 
could be the only source is too speculative to defeatsummary judgment, see Andrews v. Hansford Manufacturing Corp., Index No. 4641/00, 2002 WL 193139, *5 (N.Y. App.
Div. Jan. 22, 2002), and insufficient to establish adefamation claim against County Defendants. See Szot v. Allstate Ins. Co., 161 F.Supp.2d 596, 608- 09 (D. Md. 2001).

On July 7, 2021, the Circuit Court entered Final 
Judgment. Aiona timely appealed. 
"This court reviews a circuit court's grant or denial 
of summary judgment de novo." Bhakta v. Cnty. of Maui, 
109 Hawai‘i 198, 207, 124 P.3d 943, 952 (2005) (citation 
omitted). "This court reviews the trial court's COLs de novo." 
Id. at 208, 124 P.3d at 953 (citation omitted). Summary judgment may be "properly granted if the court found that the 
communication was incapable of bearing the defamatory meaning 
ascribed to it by the appellant as a matter of law." Fernandesv. Tenbruggencate, 65 Haw. 226, 228, 649 P.2d 1144, 1147 (1982). 
Medeiros's statements to Kerr were non-actionable 
opinions as a matter of law. 
Aiona specifically challenges the following allegedly 
defamatory statements Medeiros made to Kerr: 
(1) that Medeiros 
"did not want . . . Aiona to get that job" (referring to a 
promotion); (2) that Aiona "was like the 'modern day mafia'"; 
and (3) that Aiona was "bullying other co-workers." (Bolding 
omitted.) Aiona argues that Medeiros's statements to Kerr "were not 'rhetorical hyperbole'"; that this conclusion was "inherently flawed because [it was] premised" on the three-part Gold test for determining whether a statement in a defamation case is false and defamatory; and that the Gold test is only 
"applicable to public figures and media defendants." Aiona 
7  
          
 
 
  
  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
maintains that the Circuit Court erred in COLs 18 through 27 by 
applying "the wrong standard of law of defamation by extending the First Amendment principles applicable to public figures and media defendants to defamatory statements about a private 
person." 
The Circuit Court set forth the three-part Gold test 
in COL 26, and applied it along with related First Amendment 
case law in its other COLs. The Hawai‘ i Supreme Court adopted 
the Gold test, which derived from federal precedent that 
designed the test to protect First Amendment concerns in 
defamation suits involving either public figures, matters of 
public concern, or media defendants.  See Milkovich v. LorainJournal Co., 497 U.S. 1, 3 (1990) (involving a defamation suit by a former high school wrestling coach against a newspaper and reporter because of a newspaper article implying that the former coach lied under oath at a judicial proceeding); Unelko Corp. v. 
Rooney, 912 F.2d 1049, 1050 (9th Cir. 1990) (involving a 
defamation suit by a car products manufacturer over statements made by a television personality regarding one of its products made on a televised broadcast of "60 Minutes"). The Milkovich Court reaffirmed its prior ruling in Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. v. Hepps, 475 U.S. 767 (1986), that "a statement on matters 
of public concern must be provable as false before there can be 
liability under state defamation law, at least in situations, like the present, where a media defendant is involved." 497 U.S. at 19-20 (emphasis added). It noted that "rhetorical hyperbole" in public debate must be protected under the First Amendment, and cannot form the basis for a defamation claim. See id. at 20 (protecting "statements that cannot 'reasonably be 
interpreted as stating actual facts' about an individual" so 
that "public debate will not suffer for lack of 'imaginative

     NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
expression' or the 'rhetorical hyperbole' which has 
traditionally added much to the discourse of our Nation" (citation and brackets omitted)). 
Gold
 also involved a suit by private-figure plaintiffs 
against a public-figure defendant (George Harrison of the Beatles) and media defendants (the Honolulu Advertiser) over a matter of public concern (Harrison's legal battle against neighboring property owners regarding an easement over 
Harrison's Maui property). 88 
Hawaiʻi at 96, 962 P.2d at 355. 
The 
Gold court concluded that Harrison's statements in a 
newspaper article that he was "being raped by all these people" 
and his "privacy [was] being violated[,]" were "not false and defamatory, but rhetorical hyperbole –- figurative or hyperbolic language that would negate the impression that Harrison was asserting an objective fact about the Plaintiffs." Id. at 97, 
101, 962 P.2d at 356, 360. 
Here, because Aiona is a private figure suing a non-
media defendant over a matter that is apparently not a public concern, Aiona's contention that the Gold test does not apply appears correct. While the Circuit Court may have erred by applying the Gold test to conclude that the statements were protected "rhetorical hyperbole" in COLs 18-20 and 24, the 
Circuit Court was nevertheless correct as to its ultimate 
conclusion that Medeiros's statements to Kerr consisted of non-actionable opinion under Williams v. Kanemaru, No. CAAP-11-0000419, 2013 WL 4458887, at *2 (App. Aug. 20, 2013) (SDO),

(affirming summary judgment on different grounds than the trial

"Statements of opinions are not automatically immune 
from defamation actions[.]" Williams, 2013 WL 4458887, at *2 
(citation omitted). The Restatement defamation test 
distinguishes between statements of opinion that imply undisclosed defamatory facts (which are actionable), and statements of opinion that are based on disclosed facts known to the recipient (which are not actionable), as follows: 
A defamatory communication may consist of a statement in 
the form of an opinion, but a statement of this nature isactionable only if it implies the allegation of undisclosed
defamatory facts as the basis for the opinion. Restatement
(Second) of Torts § 566 (1977). A simple expression ofopinion based on disclosed nondefamatory facts is not itself sufficient for an action of defamation, no matter how unjustified and unreasonable the opinion may be or how
derogatory it is. The rationale behind this rule is that 
when the facts are disclosed, third parties will understand 
that they are hearing the defendant's interpretation of the
facts presented; they are therefore unlikely to construe 
the statement as insinuating the existence of additional,
undisclosed facts. 
Id. (emphases added) (cleaned up). 
Kerr's declaration related the statements at issue as 
follows: 
I was told by the Deputy Director of DEM . . . Medeiros 
there was an investigation in regards to stealing
recyclables and that they suspected . . . Aiona to be the leader of this operation. He then stated that although theinvestigation didn't have substantial evidence against Mr. 
Aiona, he believes it to be because [Aiona] "bullied" the 
other employees into not talking. . . . I was told by
[Medeiros] also that [sic] when the WS10 position opened up at Waimea, he stated that he did not want . . . Aiona to get that job. Mr. Medeiros also stated that [Aiona] bullied the other senior Equipment Operators to say "no" to call
backs so [Aiona] can get all of the overtime. When I asked 
why he believed that, he stated that [Aiona] was like the "modern day mafia" and whatever hold [Aiona] had on the other guys is why they are afraid to confront [Aiona] or speak up against him.

In Kerr's deposition, Aiona's counsel inquired about the 
circumstances under which Medeiros expressed his opinions that 
Aiona had "bullied" other employees and that he (Medeiros) did 
not want Aiona to get the job, as follows: 
Q. [(BY AIONA'S COUNSEL)] Did [Medeiros] say 
anything else about who [Aiona] bullied or how he was 
bullying people? 
A. [(BY KERR)] No. I can't remember that. The 
only thing I do remember, when it came to that, was what I got from it -- I should say it that way. What I got from
it was [Aiona] was a well- known person in that area, and 
because of his stronger attitude, I guess, or whatever, andthe people that he knew, a lot of the times the impression I got was he got his way because of that. 
 . . . . 
Q. And [Medeiros] specifically told you he wanted
to make sure my client would not get the job? 
A. He --when we were speaking, I remembered that 
statement. So what [Medeiros] had said, "Ah, i t's going to 
be --it's going to be stressful" or "It's going to be" --
I can't remember the word. He gave me the impression that he didn't want [Aiona] to get the job because it's going tobe [Aiona] ruling the Waimea baseyard. . . . He gave me the
impression that if . . . Aiona got the supervisory position, he will then control the other employees in thatbaseyard more so than he did then. 
(Emphasis added.) When Kerr asked Medeiros why he had 
those opinions, Medeiros responded that Aiona was "like the 'modern day mafia[,]'" as follows: 
[(BY KERR)] And that's when I asked [Medeiros], "What 
are you talking about?" And then that leads into the next 
statement that I made, and that's the reason why I made it,
"he stated that [Aiona]  was like the 'modern day mafia.'"  
And so I was like, "Well, what do you mean by that?" 
And then through our conversation, [Medeiros] just
explained to me that [Aiona]  was a very popular guy, his
family name is a very big name here in Hawaii and that, you
know,  sometimes you get what you want.  
(Emphasis added.) 
11  
          
 
 
 
   
  
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Under the Restatement defamation test, Medeiros's 
statements to Kerr were in the form of opinions that Aiona had 
"bullied" or controlled other employees and was like "the modern day mafia" based on the following facts that he disclosed to 
Kerr: Aiona was well-known in the area, had a "stronger 
attitude," knew a lot of people, was "very popular," and his "family name [was] a very big name here in Hawaii." See
Williams, 2013 WL 4458887, at *2. Assuming arguendo Medeiros's opinions were derogatory, the evidence reflects that they were "based on disclosed nondefamatory facts," which do not 
constitute actionable defamation under the Restatement 
defamation test, as a matter of law. See id.; Fernandes, 
65 Haw. at 228, 649 P.2d at 1147. 
Accordingly, while the Circuit Court erred in its 
analysis in COLs 18-22 and 24-27 to the extent it relied on "rhetorical hyperbole" under the Gold test for media defendants, it did not err in its citation to the Restatement defamation 
test set forth in COL 23, and its ultimate conclusion that 
Medeiros's statements to Kerr were non-actionable opinion. See
Prudential Locations, LLC
, 151 Hawaiʻi at 146, 509 P.3d at 1109. 
There was no admissible evidence of publication by 
County employees. 
Aiona contends that the County "allowed information to 
be published to non-County employees, that [Aiona]'s job was in 
jeopardy including being terminated." 
Aiona argues that 
Appellees "had a legal duty not to leak any information" about "the nature of the internal investigation, the criminal investigation or . . . the consequences" of the alleged theft investigation. Appellees argue that Aiona "submitted no evidence reasonably inferring [Appellees] were responsible for

parties." 
The record reflects that Aiona would regularly meet a 
social group at Burger King (Burger King group); and that during 
one of the meet-ups, it was rumored that "Aiona's job was at 
jeopardy as he was accused of stealing HI-5 recyclables," and that "Aiona might get terminated from his position[.]" None of the witnesses from the Burger King group, Michael Happy Hanohano (Hanohano), Edwin Akana, Jr. (Akana), and Joseph Kealoha (Kealoha), testified that the statement came from Medeiros or 
any other County employee. Hanohano testified that he heard of 
the theft allegations through Aiona. Akana testified that he could not remember who made the statement. Kealoha testified that Hanohano made the statement, but Hanohano was not then employed by the County. Thus, the Circuit Court did not err in concluding in COLs 30 and 31 that there was a "lack of admissible evidence about the source of the rumor preclud[ing] 
[Aiona]'s defamation claim." See Bhakta, 109 Hawai‘ i at 208, 
124 P.3d at 953. 
In addition, Aiona wrongly argues that because 
"Hanohano knew about the investigation, then the County failed 
in its legal duty [not to disclose] under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur." A plaintiff asserting res ipsa loquitur must 
establish that: (1) the occurrence "must be one which 
ordinarily does not occur in the absence of someone's negligence"; (2) the occurrence "must be caused by an agency or instrumentality within the exclusive control of the defendant"; and (3) the occurrence "must not have been due to any voluntary action or contribution on the part of the plaintiff."

theft included agencies outside of the County's control. Res
ipsa loquitur does not apply. 
We conclude that the Circuit Court did not err in 
granting the MSJ. See Bhakta, 109 Hawai‘i at 207, 124 P.3d at 
952. Because we affirm the Circuit Court's Order Granting MSJ 
rejecting the defamation claims, we need not address Aiona's remaining arguments regarding qualified privilege and proof of damages. 
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the (1) May 25, 
2021 Order Granting MSJ; and (2) July 7, 2021 "Final Judgment," 
both filed and entered by the Circuit Court of the Third 
Circuit.
