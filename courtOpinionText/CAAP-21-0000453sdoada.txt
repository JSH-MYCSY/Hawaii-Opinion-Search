IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAIʻ I 
THE ESTATE OF BRIAN PAUL ESTEBAN, also known as 
Brian P. Esteban, DECEASED. 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1CLP-19-0000030) 
 
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: 
Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
Petitioners-Appellants Douglas B. Esteban and Kiona L. 
Esteban (collectively Petitioners
) appeal from the Probate Court 
of the First Circuit's1 July 6, 2021 "Judgment on Order Denying 
Petition to Contest the Brian Esteban Will & Trust Dated 
3/14/2014, Filed November 10, 2020" (Judgment Denying Petition 
to Contest Will and Trust) and "Order Denying Petition to 
Contest the Brian Esteban Will & Trust Dated 3/14/2014, Filed 
1 The Honorable R. Mark Browning presided.   
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
November 10, 2020" (Order Denying Petition to Contest Will and 
Trust). 
On appeal, Petitioners contend the probate court 
"erred in failing to permit a contested hearing by referring 
[their] Petition to the Civil Trials Calendar pursuant to 
[Hawai‘i Probate Rules (HPR)] Rule 20." Petitioners further 
contend this error violated their due process rights. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve this 
appeal as discussed below, and affirm. 
HPR Rule 20 provides in pertinent part, "[t]he court 
by written order may retain a contested matter on the regular probate calendar or may assign the contested matter to the civil 
trials calendar of the circuit court." HPR Rule 20(a) (emphases 
added). We review the probate court's retention of the 
contested matter for an abuse of discretion. In re Est. of Kam, 
110 Hawai‘ i 8, 24, 129 P.3d 511, 527 (2006).  "[A]n abuse of 
discretion occurs where the trial court has clearly exceeded the 
bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles of law or 
practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant." 
Tr. of Est. of Bishop v. Au, 146 Hawaiʻ i 272, 278, 463 P.3d 929, 
935 (2020) (citations omitted).

Petitioners summarily maintain that the sheer volume 
of documents filed in the probate court and issues raised 
required more than a half day to resolve. Although Petitioners 
filed multiple documents in probate court, many of those 
documents raised the same issues or raised issues that were not 
relevant to the probate case. Thus, the volume of documents 
filed does not establish that the probate court disregarded 
rules or principles of law to Petitioners' substantial detriment. 
Petitioners also argue their procedural due process 
rights were violated when the probate court did not refer the 
contested matter to the civil trials calendar as "they did not 
have the opportunity to be heard or the opportunity to make a 
factual record." 
"[P]rocedural due process of law requires notice and 
an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a 
meaningful manner[.]" In re Guardianship of Carlsmith
, 113 
Hawai‘i 236, 239, 151 P.3d 717, 720 (2007) (cleaned up). "Where 
a party has notice and an opportunity to be heard there is not a 
denial of due process." Est. of Von Baravalle
, 144 Hawai‘i 60, 
434 P.3d 1255, No. CAAP-16-0000073, 2019 WL 762406 at *4 (App. 
Feb. 12, 2019) (SDO). 
Petitioners had notice of, and participated in, the 
proceedings in this case. 
We note that Petitioners did not

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
request transcripts of the proceedings and "[w]ithout the 
relevant transcript[s], there is insufficient evidence to review 
the alleged error[.]" State v. Hoang, 93 Hawai‘ i 333, 336, 
3 P.3d 499, 502 (2000); 
Hawai‘i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
Rule 10(b)(1)(A) (placing the burden to request the necessary 
transcripts on appellant). Thus, Petitioners failed to show 
they were denied their due process rights. 
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the probate court's 
July 6, 2021 Judgment Denying Petition to Contest Will and Trust and Order Denying Petition to Contest Will and Trust. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai‘ i, January 16, 2025.
