v. 
MONICA ALVES PERALTO, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 
5PC970000156) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant, Monica Alves Peralto (P
eralto) 
appeals from the June 22, 2021 Order Re-sentencing Defendant 
Monica Alves Peralto (Resentencing Order) filed and entered by 
the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit (Circuit Court).1 This 
appeal concerns a resentencing hearing conducted after the 
Circuit Court granted Peralto's Hawai# i Rules of Penal Procedure 
(
HRPP) Rule 40 petition. On appeal, Peralto contends that the 
Circuit Court erred and abused its discretion in sentencing Peralto to consecutive, rather than concurrent, terms of imprisonment. 
Upon careful review of the record on appeal and the 
briefs submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve Peralto's contention of error as follows, and affirm. 
1 The Honorable Randal G.B. Valenciano presided.   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Following a 1998 jury trial,2 Peralto and her then-
husband Mitchell Peralto were found guilty as charged of 
Kidnapping and Murder in the Second Degree (Murder Second), and 
Peralto was sentenced to an extended sentence of life 
imprisonment with the possibility of parole (life with parole) 
for Kidnapping and to an extended sentence of life imprisonment 
without the possibility of parole (life without parole) for 
Murder Second, with both sentences to run consecutively. 
On direct appeal in 2001, the Hawai# i Supreme Court 
affirmed Peralto's conviction of, and extended sentence for, the 
Kidnapping count; but vacated the extended sentence for Murder Second and remanded for resentencing. State v. Peralto, 95 
Hawai# i 1, 8, 18 P.3d 203, 210 (2001), abrogated on other grounds 
by State v. Kato, 147 Hawai# i 478, 465 P.3d 925 (2020). 
On remand in 2004, the Circuit Court resentenced 
Peralto to an extended sentence of life with parole for Kidnapping and to a non-extended sentence of life with parole for Murder Second, with both sentences to run consecutively. 
In 2019, following the supreme court's decision in 
Flubacher v. State, 142 Hawai# i 109, 414 P.3d 161 (2018),
3 
Peralto filed a Rule 40 petition for relief, which the Circuit Court granted in part, vacating her extended term sentence of life with parole for Kidnapping and setting a resentencing hearing.
4 
2 The Honorable George M. Masuoka presided over Peralto's 1998 trial
and sentencing, and the 2004 resentencing. 
3 In Flubacher, the supreme court held that, pursuant to Apprendi v.
New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), the fact-finder rather than the sentencing
judge must determine whether an "extended term sentence was necessary for theprotection of the public" for extended term sentencing under HRS § 706-662.142 Hawai #i at 118, 414 P.3d at 170. The Flubacher decision applied to all
cases that were not "final" (affirmed on direct appeal) before the issuance ofApprendi on June 26, 2000. Id. at 118, 414 P.3d at 170. 
4 We take judicial notice of Peralto's Rule 40 petition filed in
Special Proceeding No. 5PR191000003. Hawai #i Rules of Evidence Rule 201; See 
State v. Kwong, 149 Hawai #i 106, 117, 482 P.3d 1067, 1078 (2021) (noting that
appellate courts may take judicial notice of court records not part of therecord on appeal) (citation omitted) . 
According to the Circuit Court's
(continued...) 
2 4(...continued)  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
At the June 10, 2021 resentencing hearing, Peralto was 
resentenced to a non-extended 20-year sentence of imprisonment 
for Kidnapping, the non-extended sentence of life with parole for Murder Second remained the same, and the Circuit Court ordered both sentences to run consecutively. Both the State and Peralto 
requested the Circuit Court to run the sentences concurrently. 
The Circuit Court explained its reasoning for consecutive sentencing orally at the hearing, and in its subsequently issued June 22, 2021 Resentencing Order that stated: 
2. Considering the factors from HRS §706-606, the
factors on balance support consecutive sentencing. 
Specifically: 
a. The nature and circumstances of these two 
offenses are highly serious or extreme. 
(1) One of Defendant Peralto's motives in killing[victim] is that she believed [victim] wasworking as a police informant. This fact weighsin favor of consecutive sentencing and isrelevant to two general factors: the nature andcircumstances of the offense; and the need forthe sentence imposed to reflect the seriousnessof the offense, to promote respect for law, andto provide just punishment for the offense. 
(2) The defendants killed [victim] by beating her,binding her wrists, and taping her mouth shut.Then, plastic bags were tied or taped around herhead. After the defendants bound and gagged her,and kidnapped her from Patty Lingaton'sresidence, they abandoned her body in an openarea not far from the Lingaton residence. She eventually suffocated. 
b. The following facts are relevant to the need for
consecutive sentencing, to protect the public from furthercrimes of Defendant Peralto, and to afford adequatedeterrence to criminal conduct. Defendant Peralto engagedin extreme illegal behavior and there is a need to protectthe public from her; and to deter her and others from thisbehavior in the future. Consecutive sentencing promotes
respect for the law; and reflects the seriousness ofDefendant Peralto beating another person and thereafter,taking that person's life; and provides just punishment.Although [victim] survived being beaten by the Defendants atPatty Lingaton's residence, the Defendants continued on with 
February 11, 2021 Order Granting in Part Petitioner's April 30, 2014 Petitionfor Post-Conviction Relief, despite the holding in 
Flubacher, Peralto did not
assert the argument made in her Rule 40 Petition that she was entitled to ajury determination of consecutive sentencing. 
3   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
their plan to kill her, by thereafter suffocating her to
death. Consecutive sentencing in this case also promotesthe concept that those who cooperate with law enforcement,such as informants, are protected by the law. 
3. This Court expresses no opinion as to whether
consecutive sentencing in this case will result in asentencing disparity, when compared to other cases inHawai #i in which defendants have been convicted [sic]
kidnapping and murder. 
4. On balance, the factors in HRS §706-606 weigh
in favor of consecutive sentencing in this case. 
(Emphases added). 
On appeal, "[s]entencing decisions are reviewed under 
the abuse of discretion standard." State v. Hussein, 122 Hawai# i 
495, 503, 229 P.3d 313, 321 (2010). Under HRS § 706-668.5(2) 
(2014),5 when determining whether to impose multiple terms of 
imprisonment concurrently or consecutively, a court "shall consider the factors set forth in [HRS §] 706-606." When imposing consecutive terms of imprisonment, "a court must stateits reasons as to why a consecutive sentence rather than a  
concurrent one was required." Lewi v. State, 145 Hawai# i 333, 
350, 452 P.3d 330, 347 (2019) (quoting Hussein, 122 Hawai# i at 
509, 229 P.3d at 328). 
[T]he dual purposes behind the requirement that
reasons be stated for a court's imposition of aconsecutive sentence are to "(1) identify the factsor circumstances within the range of statutory factorsthat the court considered, and (2) confirm for the 
5 HRS § 706-668.5 states in pertinent part: 
§ 706-668.5 Multiple sentence of imprisonment.  (1)
If multiple terms of imprisonment are imposed on adefendant, whether at the same time or at different times,or if a term of imprisonment is imposed on a defendant whois already subject to an unexpired term of imprisonment, theterms may run concurrently or consecutively. Multiple termsof imprisonment run concurrently unless the court orders orthe statute mandates that the terms run consecutively. 
(2) The court, in determining whether the terms
imposed are to be ordered to run concurrently orconsecutively, shall consider the factors set forth insection 706-606. 
4   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
defendant, the victim, the public, and the appellate
court that the decision was deliberate, rational, and fair." 
Id. (internal brackets omitted) (quoting State v. Kong, 131 
Hawai# i 94, 102-03, 315 P.3d 720, 728-29 (2013)). 
"'Absent clear evidence to the contrary, it is presumed 
that a sentencing court will have considered all factors before imposing concurrent or consecutive terms of imprisonment under HRS § 706–606.'" Kong, 131 Hawai# i at 102, 315 P.3d at 728 
(brackets omitted) (quoting Hussein, 122 Hawai# i at 503, 229 P.3d 
at 321). 
However, "the sentencing court 'is not required to 
articulate and explain its conclusions with respect to every factor listed in HRS § 706–606[,]'" but rather must "'articulate its reasoning only with respect to those factors it relies on in imposing consecutive sentences.'" Lewi, 145 Hawai# i at 350-51, 
452 P.3d at 347-48 (quoting Kong, 131 Hawai# i at 102, 315 P.3d at 
720). 
Peralto raises numerous arguments why a consecutive 
sentence was inappropriate, including: that Peralto had "essentially no criminal record" prior to these offenses; that the Circuit Court based her sentence on "facts that were incorrect or had no bearing on consecutive sentencing," citing State v. Vellina, 106 Hawai# i 441, 106 P.3d 364 (2005);
6 that the 
Circuit Court erroneously concluded that consecutive sentencing was necessary to protect the public; that the Circuit Court did not explain its reasoning for consecutive sentencing per State v. 
6 In Vellina, the supreme court held that where there was nothing in
the record to support the circuit court's conclusion that the defendant sold
stolen firearms for drugs, and the court "'exceeded the bounds of reason'" insentencing the defendant to consecutive sentences. 106 Hawai #i at 450, 106
P.3d at 373 (citation omitted). 
There was no trial in Vellina
, no pre-
sentence investigation report ( PSI), and the prosecutor did not offer proof to
substantiate the allegation. Id. Here, the record reflects that the updated
PSI prepared for the 2021 resentencing included the PSI from Peralto's 1998sentencing that contained a description of the incident. A court may considerarrest reports and "other hearsay 'information furnished to the court in apresentence diagnosis and report.'" State v. Pantoja, 89 Hawai #i 492, 498,
974 P.2d 1082, 1088 (App. 1999) (citations and brackets omitted). 
Thus, the
fact that Peralto thought the victim was an informant was properly in therecord before the Circuit Court to consider for purposes of consecutivesentencing. See id. 
5    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Barrios, 139 Hawai# i 321, 389 P.3d 916 (2016) and "failed to 
adequately specify how an additional 20 years was warranted";7 
that the Circuit Court should have considered that Peralto was 
"raped, assaulted, molested by several prison staff members and police officers while in custody" and that Peralto was "an exemplary inmate" who completely turned her life around; that the remaining HRS § 706-606 factors were "given short shrift by the court"; and that the Circuit Court "was confused as to whether it had discretion to remove the 'consecutive' designation from the sentences" Peralto had previously received. 
Here, there is no indication in the record that the 
Circuit Court did not independently determine that consecutive sentencing was appropriate, or that the Circuit Court was confused about whether it had the discretion to not impose consecutive sentencing. At the resentencing hearing, the Circuit Court stated, it "look[ed] at this case," and it "believe[d] that consecutive sentencing [wa]s appropriate" based on its review of the HRS § 706-606 factors. The Circuit Court's Resentencing Order is clear and does not indicate any confusion, and reflects an analysis of all the sentencing factors the Court deemed appropriate and applicable. The Circuit Court is presumed to have considered all factors before imposing the consecutive sentence. See Kong, 131 Hawai# i at 102, 315 P.3d at 728. 
Even though the Circuit Court is "not required to 
articulate and explain its conclusions with respect to every factor listed in HRS § 706-606," Lewi, 145 Hawai# i at 350-51, 452 
P.3d at 347-48, the record reflects that the Circuit Court focused on the nature and circumstances of the offense under HRS § 706-606(1), to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for 
7 In Barrios, the supreme court held that prior to imposing multiple
consecutive sentences, a sentencing court must explain its rationale for each
consecutive sentence. 139 Hawai #i at 337, 389 P.3d at 932. The supreme court
vacated the defendant's sentence because the circuit court failed to adequately explain its rationale for each of the six consecutive sentences itimposed. Id. at 338, 389 P.3d at 933. This case did not involve imposition
of multiple consecutive sentences, and Barrios is inapposite. 
6   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the offense under HRS § 706-606(2)(a). The Circuit Court cited 
Peralto's motive for killing the victim based on Peralto's belief that the victim "was working as a police informant"; the "extreme" circumstances of the offense where the defendants killed the victim "by beating her, binding her wrists, and taping her mouth shut," tying plastic bags around the victim's head; and that the defendants "bound and gagged" the victim, who "eventually suffocated." The Court considered the need to deter criminal conduct under HRS § 706-606(2)(b) and to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant under HRS § 706-606(2)(c), by referring to Peralto's "extreme illegal behavior," that warranted a "need to protect the public" from Peralto, and "to deter her and others from this behavior in the future[.]" Id. The Court pointed out that even after the victim "survived 
being beaten" by the defendants, they "continued on with their plan to kill her, by thereafter suffocating her to death." Id.
Finally, the Court explained that: "Consecutive sentencing in this case also promotes the concept that those who cooperate with law enforcement, such as informants, are protected by the law." In summary, the Circuit Court sufficiently articulated its reasoning with respect to the HRS § 706-606 factors that it relied on in imposing Peralto's consecutive sentence. Id.; see 
also Kong, 131 Hawai# i at 102, 315 P.3d at 728. 
The Circuit Court did not reference the hardships that 
Peralto endured while incarcerated or her prior criminal record, and the Circuit Court was not required to do so. See Kong, 131 
Hawai# i at 102-03, 315 P.3d at 728-29 (citing Hussein, 122 Hawai# i 
at 509-10, 229 P.3d at 327-28); see also State v. Fetuao, No. CAAP-12-0001069, 132 Hawai# i 183, at *4 (App. Feb. 28, 2014) 
(SDO) (citing Kong, 131 Hawai# i at 103, 315 P.3d at 729) 
("Although the Circuit Court did not specifically address certain facts in the record that may have weighed in Fetuao's favor with respect to other HRS § 706–606 factors, the Circuit Court is not required to do so."). 
The Circuit Court is only required to 
"identify[] the facts or circumstances within the range of statutory factors that the court considered . . . ," and the 
7   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Circuit Court did so in this case. Lewi, 145 Hawai# i at 350-51, 
452 P.3d at 347-48. We therefore conclude that the Circuit Court 
did not abuse its discretion in imposing consecutive sentences in resentencing Peralto. See Hussein, 122 Hawai# i at 503, 229 P.3d 
at 321; Kong, 131 Hawai# i at 102-03, 315 P.3d at 728-29. 
For the foregoing reasons, the June 22, 2021 Order Re-
sentencing Defendant Monica Alves Peralto, filed and entered by the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit, is affirmed.
