IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
AMAN SAMRAO, M.D., Petitioner-Appellant, v.
LORRIE BETSILL NIELSON, Respondent-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 2DSS-21-0000169) 
ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and McCullen, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of Respondent-Appellee Lorrie 
Bestell Nielson's (
Nielson) October 26, 2021 "Motion to Dismiss 
[Petitioner-Appellant Aman Samrao, M.D. (Samrao)]'s Appeal From 
Order Denying [Nielson]'s Motion for Sanctions Pursuant to DCRCP 
Rule 11 and Granting [Nielson]'s Motion for Attorneys' Fees and Costs Pursuant to HRS 605-10.5(h) and [Nielson]'s Motion for Sanctions," the papers in support and in opposition, and the record, the following appears: 
Nielson asks the court to dismiss the appeal, under 
Hawai#i
 Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 3,1 because 
Samrao violated HRAP Rules 10(b)(2) and 12.1 by failing to timely request transcripts or file a jurisdiction statement. Further, Nielson requests that the court sanction Samrao and award Nielson 
1 Nielson cites to the portion of HRAP Rule 3 that states: "Failure of
an appellant to take any step other than the timely filing of a notice
of appeal does not affect the validity of the appeal, but is ground only forsuch action as the appellate court deems appropriate, which may includedismissal of the appeal." NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
attorneys' fees and costs under HRAP Rule 12.12 for violating the 
court's policy against piecemeal appeals, because this is the 
second of three appeals initiated by Samrao from the same underlying proceeding. 
In opposition, Samrao concedes that the appeal should 
be dismissed. However, Samrao argues that an award of attorney's fees and costs to Nielson is not warranted because: Nielson did not need to file the motion to dismiss the appeal where the court had already issued a notice that Samrao was in default on the jurisdiction statement and opening brief and the court could dismiss the appeal sua sponte; Samrao's counsel purportedly was "seeking out a stipulation" to withdraw the appeal; and Nielson never demanded that Samrao dismiss the appeal. 
On October 20, 2021, the Appellate Clerk notified the 
parties that Samrao had failed to file a jurisdiction statement or opening brief by the deadline, the matter would be brought to the court's attention on November 1, 2021, and the appeal may be dismissed. Samrao did not respond to the notice or file a statement of jurisdiction or opening brief. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion to 
dismiss the appeal is granted, and the appeal in CAAP-21-0000465 is dismissed for Samrao's failure to file the statement of jurisdiction and the opening brief. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the motion for sanctions is 
denied, without prejudice to Nielson seeking attorney's fees and costs under Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 604-10.5(h) should she be the prevailing party in the action as specified in that statute. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, March 21, 2022.

2 HRAP rule 12.1(e) provides: "Failure to file a statement of
