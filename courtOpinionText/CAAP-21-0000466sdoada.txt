STATE OF HAWAIʻ I, Plaintiff-Appellant, v. 
DAVID JOHN MICHAELEDES, Defendant-Appellee. 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 5CPC-20-0000283) 
  
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: 
Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Wadsworth and McCullen, JJ.) 
Plaintiff-Appellant State of Hawai‘ i appeals from the 
Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit's August 10, 2021 (1) "Order 
Granting Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Based Upon Defective 
Charges[,]" and (2) "Order Denying the State's Motion to Amend 
Felony Information[.]"  1
For a brief background, the State charged Defendant-
Appellee David John Michaeledes by Felony Information and Non-
1 The Honorable Randal G.B. Valenciano presided.   
 
   
 
 
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Felony Complaint with (1) Reckless Driving of Vehicle, in 
violation of Hawai‘ i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291-2 (2020); 
(2) Assault in the Second Degree, in violation of
 HRS § 707-
711(1)(a) and/or (d) (2014, Supp. 2019); and (3) Accidents 
Involving Substantial Bodily Injury, in violation of HRS § 291C-
12.5 (2020).  
Michaeledes moved to dismiss the charges arguing that 
the information was defective; the State moved to amend the 
information. The circuit court denied the State's motion to 
amend and granted Michaeledes' motion to dismiss. The State 
filed a timely notice of appeal. 
On appeal, the State raises 
three points of error challenging the circuit court's orders.2 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve the 
points of error as discussed below, and vacate and remand. 
2 The State raises the following three points of error: 
A. "The Circuit Court erred by dismissing the charge of Reckless 
Driving, HRS § 291-2, reasoning that the charge was defective because 
it did not allege that Appellee operated a vehicle on a public highway"; 
B. "The Circuit Court erred by concluding as a matter of law that felony informations, like indictments, may not be amended to allege 
statutory definitions or essential elements"; and 
C. "Based on its erroneous conclusion that felony informations may not be amended, the Circuit Court abused its discretion by dismissing 
the felony information." 
(Emphases omitted.) 
2   
 
  
 
     
 
 
 
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(1) In its first point of error, the State contends 
the circuit court "erred by dismissing the Reckless Driving 
charge, HRS § 291-2, reasoning that it was defective because it 
did not allege the operation of a vehicle on a public highway." 
(Emphasis omitted.) 
Whether the information set forth all essential 
elements of the charged offense is reviewed de novo. State v.
Wheeler, 121 Hawai‘ i 383, 390, 219 P.3d 1170, 1177 (2009). The 
interpretation of a statute is also reviewed de novo. State v.
Michaeledes, 152 Hawai‘ i 217, 220, 524 P.3d 1241, 1244 (2023). 
Here, the circuit court ruled the charge for Reckless 
Driving was defective because it "did not provide the statutory definition of 'operate.'" The circuit court relied on State v.
Wheeler, 121 Hawai‘ i 383, 219 P.3d 1170 (2009). 
In Wheeler, the defendant was charged with Operating a 
Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), in 
violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1).
3 121 Hawai‘ i at 385, 391, 219 
P.3d at 1172, 1178. For OVUII, HRS chapter 291E defines the 
3 HRS § 291E-61 (2020) provides in pertinent part: 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle 
under the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates 
or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle: 
(1) While under the influence of alcohol in an amount sufficient to impair the person's normal 
mental faculties or ability to care for the 
person and guard against casualty[.]

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
term "operate" as driving a vehicle "upon a public way, street, 
road, or highway[.]" HRS § 291E-1 (2020). Thus, the Hawai‘ i 
Supreme Court held the definition of "operate" in HRS chapter 
291E established an attendant circumstance of the OVUII offense, 
that the driving occur "upon a public way, street, road, or 
highway." Wheeler, 121 Hawai‘ i at 392, 219 P.3d at 1179. 
Unlike HRS chapter 291E, HRS chapter 291 does not 
define the term "operates" as used in Reckless Driving. HRS 
§ 291-2 provides in relevant part that "[w]hoever operates any 
vehicle or rides any animal recklessly in disregard of the 
safety of persons or property is guilty of reckless driving of 
vehicle or reckless riding of an animal, as appropriate[.]" 
(Emphasis added.) HRS chapter 291, Part I, provides definitions 
for the following three terms: (1) "Intoxicating liquor"; (2) "Public street, road, or highway"; and (3) "Scenic 
lookout[.]" 
But HRS chapter 291, Part I, does not provide a 
definition for the term "operates" as used in HRS § 291-2 and, 
thus, there is no attendant circumstance that the driving of the 
vehicle or riding of an animal must occur on a public street. 
Fagaragan v. State
, 132 Hawai‘i 224, 242, 320 P.3d 889, 907 
(2014) (explaining the canon of construction expressio unius est 
exclusio alterius applies "only where in the natural association 
of ideas the contrast between a specific subject matter which is 
4   
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
expressed and one which is not mentioned leads to an inference 
that the latter was not intended to be included within the 
statute") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
By incorporating HRS chapter 291E's definition of the 
term "operate" into HRS § 291-2, the circuit court added an 
element (upon a public, street, road, or highway) to the HRS 
§ 291-2 Reckless Driving offense, which it cannot do. See State
v. Haugen, 104 Hawai‘i 71, 75, 85 P.3d 178, 182 (2004) ("A 
cardinal canon of statutory construction is that this court 
cannot change the language of the statute, supply a want, or 
enlarge upon it in order to make it suit a certain state of 
facts.") (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). 
In sum, the circuit court erred in interpreting HRS 
§ 291-2 as requiring the attendant circumstance that the defendant's conduct occur on a public street. 
(2) The State's second and third points of error are 
related. 
The State contends the circuit court "erred by 
concluding that as a matter of law, felony informations may not be amended to allege statutory definitions or essential elements" and, thus, erred in dismissing the information. 
(Emphasis omitted.) 
In State v. Thompson
, the circuit court granted the 
prosecution's motion to amend a felony information. 154 Hawai‘i 
422, 554 P.3d 567, No. CAAP-23-0000715, 2024 WL 4043727 at *2

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(App. 2024) (SDO). On appeal, the defendant argued the 
amendment was improper because HRS § 806-9 (2014)4 requires the 
laws applying to indictments apply to informations. Id. at *3. 
This court affirmed the circuit court's order granting 
the motion to amend, explaining that Hawai‘ i Rules of Penal 
Procedure (HRPP
) Rule 7(f)(1)5 plainly and unambiguously permits 
an amendment, which "makes sense as 'an indictment is an action of the grand jury and not subject to change by either the court 
or prosecution, except to correct formalistic errors[.]'" Id.
at *3, *4 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
As we did in Thompson, we similarly hold here that 
HRPP Rule 7(f)(1) permitted amendment of the information. Thus, 
the circuit court erred in denying the State's motion to amend 
the information, and erred in granting Michaeledes' motion to 
dismiss. 
Based on the foregoing, we vacate the circuit court's 
August 10, 2021 (1) "Order Granting Defendant's Motion to 
4 HRS § 806-9 provides: 
All provisions of law applying to prosecutions upon 
indictments, to writs and process therein, and the issuing 
and service thereof, to motions, pleadings, trials, and 
punishments, or the passing or execution of any sentence, and to all proceedings in cases of indictment, whether in 
the court of original or appellate jurisdiction, shall in 
the same manner and to the same extent as near as may be, 
apply to information and all prosecutions and proceedings 
thereon. 
5 HRPP Rule 7(f)(1) provides, "[t]he court may permit a charge other 
than an indictment to be amended at any time before trial commences if 
substantial rights of the defendant are not prejudiced."

State's Motion to Amend Felony Information[,]" and remand this 
case to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent 
with this summary disposition order.
