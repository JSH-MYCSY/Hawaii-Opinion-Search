IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
ROBERTA WILBORN, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CR. NO. 1CPC-19-0000658) 
ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL 
FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By:  Leonard, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Nakasone, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of the Motion to Dismiss for Lack of 
Appellate Jurisdiction (
Motion), filed by Plaintiff-Appellee 
State of Hawai# i on October 15, 2021, the papers in support, and 
the record, it appears we lack jurisdiction over Defendant-
Appellant Roberta Wilborn's (Wilborn) appeal from Case No. 1CPC
-
19-0000658 because the Circuit Court of the First Circuit Court (Circuit Court) has not entered a final, appealable order or 
judgment and the appeal is premature. 
Wilborn appears to appeal from the Circuit Court's 
September 22, 2021 Order Granting Motion for Mental Examination 
to Determine [Wilborn]'s Fitness to Proceed and Penal Responsibility.  The Circuit Court did not certify the order for interlocutory appeal. 
"It is well-settled that the right to appeal is purely 
statutory and exists only when given by some constitutional or statutory provision."  Burke v. Cty. of Maui
, 95 Hawai# i 288, 
289, 22 P.3d 84, 85 (2001). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
There is no statutory right to appeal under HRS 
Chapter 704 when a defendant is ordered to undergo an evaluation 
to determine fitness to proceed or penal responsibility.  There is no appealable order or final judgment in the record on appeal.Therefore, this court lacks appellate jurisdiction.  
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is 
granted and the appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions 
are dismissed as moot. 
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, October 22, 2021.
