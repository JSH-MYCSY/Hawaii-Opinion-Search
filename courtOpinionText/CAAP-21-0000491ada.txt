 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY NAKASONE, J. 
The sole challenge in this appeal is to the imposition 
of an "internet crimes against children fee" (ICAC fee) under 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 846F-3  for the conviction of an 
offense that is not included within the definition of 
 21
"[i]nternet crimes against children" under HRS § 846F-2.
1 HRS § 846F- 3 (2014 & 2016 Supp.), entitled "Internet crimes 
against children fee," provides: 
(a) The court shall order every defendant to pay an 
internet crimes against children fee of up to $100 for each 
felony or misdemeanor conviction; provided that no fee shall be 
ordered when the court determines that the defendant is unable to 
pay the fee. 
(b) When a defendant is also ordered to pay a fine, make 
restitution, pay a crime victim compensation fee, or pay other 
fees in addition to the internet crimes against children fee, 
payments by the defendant shall be made in the order of priority 
established under section 706- 651. 
(c) The defendant shall pay the internet crimes against 
children fee to the clerk of the court. The fee shall be 
deposited with the director of finance who shall transmit the fee 
to the internet crimes against children special fund pursuant 
to section 846F-4. 
(Emphasis added.) 
2   HRS §  846F-2  (2014), entitled "Definitions," defines "Internet 
crimes against children" as certain specified offenses  (internet crimes 
against children offenses  or ICAC offenses) , as follows:  
As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise 
requires: 
"Internet crimes against children" means  promoting 
child abuse in the first degree under section 707 -750, 
promoting child abuse in the second degree under section 
707-751, promoting child abuse in the third degree under 
section 707- 752, electronic enticement of a child in the 
first degree under section 707- 756, electronic enticement 
of a child in the second degree under section 707- 757, 
indecent electronic display to a child under section  
707-759, or promoting pornography for minors under section 
712

Defendant-Appellant Bryson Jay Keliiku Pololei 
Nagamine (Nagamine) appeals from the August 11, 2021 Judgment of 
Conviction and Sentence, entered by the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit (Circuit Court),
3 and only challenges the 
imposition of the ICAC fee. 
We hold that the ICAC fee applies only to ICAC 
offenses, and should not have been imposed for the Habitually Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (Habitual OVUII) conviction in this case. Accordingly, we reverse the imposition of the $100.00 ICAC fee. 
I. BACKGROUND 
On January 7, 2021, Nagamine was charged with Habitual 
OVUII, in violation of HRS § 291E-61.5(a)(1)(2)(A); operating a vehicle after his license was suspended or revoked for OVUII, in violation of HRS § 291E-62(a)(1) and/or (2); and Inattention to Driving, in violation of HRS § 291-12. On May 19, 2021, Nagamine pled no contest to Habitual OVUII, and the remaining counts were dismissed with prejudice. 
At the August 11, 2021 sentencing hearing, the Circuit 
Court sentenced Nagamine to five years of probation with six months in jail, and ordered Nagamine to pay a $2,000.00 fine and other fees, including the ICAC fee at issue in this appeal. Nagamine objected to the $100.00 ICAC fee based on HRS § 37—52.3.
4 Nagamine timely appealed. 
3 The Honorable Kathleen N.A. Watanabe presided. 
4 HRS § 37— 52.3 (2009 & 2016 Supp.), entitled "Criteria for the 
establishment and continuance of special funds," (special funds statute) sets 
forth criteria for special funds and specifies that the program receiving the 
special funds must have a "clear link" to the revenue source, as follows: 
Special funds shall be established only pursuant to an act of the legislature. The legislature, in establishing or

II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
The interpretation of a statute is a question of law 
reviewable de novo. State v. Borge, 152 Hawai‘ i 458, 464, 
526 P.3d 435, 441 (2023). Interpretation of a statute is 
governed by the following principles:  
First, the fundamental starting point for statutory 
interpretation is the language of the statute itself. Second, where the statutory language is plain and 
unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain 
and obvious meaning. Third, implicit in the task of 
statutory construction is our foremost obligation to 
ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the 
language contained in the statute itself. Fourth, when 
there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or indistinctiveness 
or uncertainty of an expression used in a statute, an 
ambiguity exists. 
When there is ambiguity in a statute, "the meaning of the 
ambiguous words may be sought by examining the context, 
with which the ambiguous words, phrases, and sentences may 
be compared, in order to ascertain their true meaning." 
Moreover, the courts may resort to extrinsic aids in determining legislative intent, such as legislative 
history, or the reason and spirit of the law. 
Barker v. Young, 153 Hawai‘ i 144, 148, 528 P.3d 217, 221 (2023)

reviewing a special fund to determine whether it should be

(2) Reflects a clear nexus between the benefits 
sought and charges made upon the program users or 
beneficiaries or a clear link between the program and the 
sources of revenue, as opposed to serving primarily as a 
means to provide the program or users with an automatic 
means of support that is removed from the normal budget and appropriation process[.]

  An alleged sentencing error is reviewed for abuse of 
discretion. State v. Barnes, 145 Hawai‘i 213, 217, 450 P.3d 743, 
747 (2019). 
III. DISCUSSION 
On appeal, Nagamine argues that: 
(1) the ICAC fee 
under HRS § 846F-3 "may only be imposed where a convicted 
defendant has committed one of the Internet Crimes Against 
Children defined in HRS § 846[F]-2";5 and (2) HRS § 37-52.3 
prohibits the imposition of the ICAC fee for an offense such as Habitual OVUII with no "clear link" between the ICAC special fund and the ICAC fee. 
A. The ICAC fee applies to every defendant convicted of 
an ICAC offense defined under HRS § 846F-2, not to 
all defendants convicted of any criminal offense. 
In response to Nagamine's contention that the ICAC fee 
"may only be imposed" where a convicted defendant has committed 
an ICAC offense defined in HRS § 846F-2, the State argues "the plain language of HRS §[]846F-3(a) mandates imposition of the ICAC fee for every misdemeanor and felony offense that a defendant is convicted of (except if the defendant does not have 
the ability to pay)"; and "where a statute limits imposition of 
a fee to specific types of convictions, the statutes clearly indicate the types of convictions to which the fee applies." The State asserts that because "HRS §[]846F-3(a) specifies that the ICAC fee is imposed 'for each felony and misdemeanor conviction,'" this "indicates that the fee applies to all such convictions, rather than solely convictions for ICAC offenses." 
5 The parties were permitted to submit an optional supplemental 
brief addressing "whether or how the definition of an ' [i]nternet crimes 
against children' . . . offense set forth in HRS § 846F-2 applies to the 
imposition of an ICAC fee under HRS § 846F-3." Both parties did so. 
5  
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
  
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The State claims that the ICAC definition in HRS § 846F-2 
"limits the kinds of training, investigations, prosecutions, and initiatives that ICAC funds may be used for; it does not limit the types of defendants upon whom the ICAC fee must be imposed." 
As explained below, we conclude that the ICAC fee 
applies only to ICAC offenses. This conclusion is based on the 
plain language of HRS Chapter 846F, its legislative history, and 
the requirements that the ICAC fees and ICAC special fund must comply with in HRS § 37-52.3. 
1. The plain language defining an ICAC offense 
under HRS § 846F-2 limits the imposition of the 
HRS § 846F-3 ICAC fee to the enumerated ICAC offenses. 
HRS Chapter 846F, entitled "Internet Crimes Against 
Children," created the ICAC fee in HRS § 846F-3 and established 
the ICAC special fund to assist in the investigation and prosecution of internet crimes against children. The plain language of HRS § 846F-2 states that the term "[i]nternet crimes against children" "[a]s used in this chapter," means the offenses of "promoting child abuse," "electronic enticement of a child," "indecent electronic display to a child," and "promoting 
pornography for minors." See Borge
, 152 Hawai‘i at 464, 526 P.3d 
at 441 ("[W]here the statutory language is plain and 
unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain and 
obvious meaning." (citation omitted)). 
HRS § 846F-3(a) states: 
The court shall order every defendant to pay an internet 
crimes against children fee of up to $100 for each felony 
or misdemeanor conviction; provided that no fee shall be ordered when the court determines that the defendant is 
unable to pay the fee.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(Emphasis added.) The ICAC definition under HRS § 846F-2 
applies wherever the ICAC term is "used in this chapter[.]" HRS § 846F-3 requires the imposition of the "internet crimes against children fee" on "every defendant" for "each felony or misdemeanor conviction[.]" (Emphasis added.) Notably, HRS § 846F-3 applies the fee only to felonies and misdemeanors and 
not to all grades of criminal offenses, which would ordinarily 
include petty misdemeanors. See HRS § 701-107(1) (2014) 
("Crimes are of three grades: felonies, misdemeanors, and petty misdemeanors"); cf. HRS §§ 706-605(6) and 351-62.6 (imposing a crime victim compensation fee "upon every person convicted of a criminal offense" and "upon every defendant who has been convicted or who has entered a plea" in differing amounts for felonies, misdemeanors, and petty misdemeanors) (emphasis added). The limitation of the ICAC fee specifically to a "felony or misdemeanor" conviction is logically consistent with the grades of the ICAC offenses set forth in HRS § 846F-2, which include only felonies and misdemeanors, and not petty 
misdemeanors.
6 See Moranz v. Harbor Mall, LLC , 150 Hawai‘i 387, 
398, 502 P.3d 488, 499 (2022) (statutory interpretation that is 
"inconsistent, contradictory, and illogical" should be avoided (cleaned up)). Applying the statutory interpretation urged by the State -- that "felony or misdemeanor" in HRS § 846F-3 means all criminal offenses -- would also render the specific language 
6 Each ICAC offense listed in HRS § 846F- 2 is a felony or a 
misdemeanor, as follows: the Class A felony offense of first- degree 
promoting child abuse; the Class B felony offense of second- degree promoting 
child abuse; the Class C felony offense of third- degree promoting child 
abuse; the Class B felony of electronic enticement of a child in the first 
degree; the Class C felony of electronic enticement of a child in the second 
degree; the misdemeanor of indecent electronic display to a child; and the 
Class C felony of promoting pornography for minors.

of "felony or misdemeanor" a nullity, a result we must avoid. 
See Jijun Yin v. Aguiar, 146 Hawai‘ i 254, 265, 463 P.3d 911, 922 
(2020) (noting the "rules of statutory construction require 
rejection of an interpretation that renders any part of the statutory language a nullity" (citation omitted)). Further, a pari materia construction of these related statutes -- HRS 
§ 846F-2's definition of ICAC offenses and HRS § 846F-3's 
imposition of ICAC fees -- compels the same conclusion that the ICAC fees apply only to ICAC offenses. See
 HRS § 1-16. 
2. The legislative history also confirms the ICAC 
fee was intended to apply only to ICAC 
offenses. 
Assuming arguendo the ICAC fee statute HRS § 846F-3 is 
ambiguous, the legislative history of HRS Chapter 846F reflects 
that the ICAC fee was intended to apply only to ICAC offenses. 
See Barker, 153 Hawai‘ i at 148, 528 P.3d at 221.  HRS Chapter 
846F was enacted as Act 115 in 2014, as a new chapter known as 
"Alicia's Law," in memory of a victim of an internet predator. 2014 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 115, § 1 at 325. 
Act 115 states: "The 
purpose of this Act is to combat internet crimes against children by establishing an internet crimes against children fee and a special fund to assist law enforcement to investigate and prosecute internet crimes against children and groups working directly to fight internet crimes against children." Id.The 
legislative history reflects that the initial bill, Senate Bill 
702, went through multiple committees and readings in the Hawai‘ i 
State Senate and House of Representatives, until it passed Final 
Reading by the Conference Committee on April 25, 2014.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The final Conference Committee Report No. 88-14 
specifically contained language clarifying that the proposed 
ICAC fee would be imposed for felony or misdemeanor convictions of "internet crimes against children," as follows: 
The purpose of this measure is to combat internet 
crimes against children by: 
(1) Establishing an internet crimes against children fee, 
which shall be assessed against a defendant for each felony 
or misdemeanor conviction of internet crimes against 
children; 
(2) Establishing an internet crimes against children 
special fund intended to enable law enforcement to 
investigate and prosecute such crimes and to assist groups 
working directly to fight such crimes; and 
(3) Making an appropriation to the internet crimes against 
children special fund and from the special fund for 
training and equipment, investigation and prosecution of 
internet crimes against children, and combatting such crimes. 
Your Committee on Conference finds that in 2008, USA 
Today  reported that the Internet Crimes Against Children 
Task Forces had  identified 2,297 unique computers in Hawaii 
trading sadistic images  of infants and toddlers being tied 
up, tortured, and raped. Due to  limited funds, equipment, 
and training, only a very small percentage  of investigative 
leads related to such crimes are examined every  month. Your 
Committee on Conference finds that imposing a fee on  
every defendant 
convicted of a felony or misdemeanor for 
internet crimes against children  will help to establish 
funding to enhance  the investigation and prosecution of 
such crimes and protect  Hawaii's children.  
Your Committee on Conference has amended this measure 
by: 
(1) Inserting an internet crimes against children fee 
amount 
of up to $100 for each felony or misdemeanor 
conviction for internet crimes against children; 
(2) Inserting an appropriation amount of $62,500 to be 
deposited from general revenues into the internet crimes 
against children special fund and fro m the special fund for 
training and equipment, investigation and prosecution of 
No. 1548- 14, in 2014 House Journal, at 1414; Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 88- 14, in 
2014 Senate Journal, at 726.

internet crimes against children, and combatting such 
crimes; and 
(3) Inserting an effective date of July 1, 2014. 
Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 88-14, in 2014 Senate Journal, at 726 
(emphases added). As shown above, the legislature repeatedly 
and consistently specified that the ICAC fee would apply to felony or misdemeanor convictions "for internet crimes against children" or "of internet crimes against children[.]" Id.
(emphases added). Thus, the legislative history confirms the ICAC fee was intended to apply only to ICAC offenses defined 
under HRS § 846F-2. See Barker, 153 Hawai‘ i at 148, 528 P.3d at 
221. 
3. Limiting the imposition of the ICAC fee to 
ICAC offenses is consistent with HRS § 37-52.3's requirement of "a clear link" 
between the ICAC special fund and its revenue 
source. 
Nagamine argues that the imposition of the ICAC fee 
was error because the special funds statute, HRS § 37—52.3, 
requires a "clear link" between the special fund and its revenue source; and no "link" or "nexus" exists between the ICAC fee and his Habitual OVUII conviction. In its Answering Brief, the State does not specifically counter Nagamine's argument, and argues that ICAC fees were upheld as constitutional fines under 
State v. Adcock, 148 Hawai‘ i 308, 473 P.3d 769 (App. 2020).
8 
8 In Adcock , 148 Hawai‘i at 321, 473 P.3d at 782 (brackets omitted), 
the defendant opposed the imposition of the ICAC fee for his first- degree 
terroristic threatening offenses because "none of his offenses are in any way 
related to internet crimes against children." This court "read this complaint as an argument that the statute violates his right to substantive 
due because there is no rational basis for the imposition of the ICAC fee," 
and rejected it, upholding the ICAC fees in that case. 
Id. The defendant in 
Adcock did not challenge, and this court did not address, the imposition of 
the ICAC fee based on the ICAC definition in HRS § 846F
-2.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The special funds statute, HRS § 37-52.3, establishes 
the "[c]riteria for the establishment and continuance of special 
funds." HRS § 37—52.3 requires "a clear link between the program and the sources of revenue[.]" The legislative history of this statute indicates that "because special and revolving funds should only be used for their specified purpose and cannot 
be used for other programs, efforts must be made to ensure that 
these funds are the most appropriate funding mechanism for the programs they support." H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 601, in 2013 House Journal, at 1122-23. 
In this case, the program subject to HRS § 37-52.3 is 
the ICAC special fund created by HRS § 846F-4, which states: 
(a) There is established in the state treasury the internet 
crimes against children special fund, into which shall be 
deposited: 
(1) All fees collected pursuant to section 846F-3 ; 
(2) Moneys appropriated by the legislature to the 
fund; 
(3) Other grants and gifts made to the fund; and 
(4) Any income and capital gains earned by the fund. 
(b) Moneys in the internet crimes against children special 
fund shall be expended by the department of the attorney general 
for the following purposes: 
(1) To provide training and equipment for local law 
enforcement agencies to use in investigating and 
prosecuting internet crimes against children, including 
funding to increase the forensic capacity of digital evidence; 
(2) To enable law enforcement to investigate and 
prosecute internet crimes against children; and 
(3) To assist groups working directly to combat 
internet crimes against children. 
(Emphases added.)

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The ICAC special fund is funded in part by "[a]ll fees 
collected pursuant to section 846F-3[,]" and HRS § 846F-3(c), in 
turn, provides that the ICAC fee "shall be deposited with the director of finance who shall transmit the fee to the [ICAC] special fund pursuant to section 846F-4." Thus, as a special fund, the ICAC special fund is subject to HRS § 37-52.3's 
requirement of maintaining "a clear link" between the ICAC 
special fund and its revenue source -- the ICAC fees collected under HRS §§ 846F-3 and -4. 
The term "clear link" is not defined in HRS § 37—52.3. 
When a term is not defined by statute, "we determine its meaning by looking to its 'ordinary and familiar signification' and 'general and popular use[,]'" and we may "also consider 'legal or other well accepted dictionaries.'" State v. Kaeo, 151 
Hawai‘i 329, 334, 512 P.3d 154, 159 (2021) (citation omitted). 
The word "clear" is defined as "free from obscurity or ambiguity[,] easily understood[,] and unmistakable." Clear, 
Merriam-Webster, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ clear (last visited Feb. 21, 2025). "Link" is defined as "a 
connecting element or factor." Link, Merriam-Webster, 
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/link (last visited 
Feb. 21, 2025). Thus, "clear link" means an easily understood connection between two elements. 
Here, the ICAC fee was imposed on a Habitual OVUII 
conviction, which is not an ICAC offense. There is no "clear link" or easily understood connection between the ICAC special fund and an ICAC fee collected from a defendant convicted of Habitual OVUII. Habitual OVUII does not involve harm to children via electronic means that are characteristic of the ICAC offenses. Thus, the imposition of the ICAC fee in this 
12  
  
 
 
  
 
  
 
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
case did not comply with the "clear link" requirement of HRS 
§ 37-52.3. 
Accordingly, we conclude the Circuit Court acted 
outside its discretion in imposing the ICAC fee on Nagamine's 
Habitual OVUII conviction in this case. See Barnes, 145 Hawai‘ i 
at 217, 450 P.3d at 747. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
For these reasons, we reverse the ICAC fee imposed by 
the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit's August 11, 2021 
Judgment of Conviction and Sentence. We affirm the remainder of Nagamine's sentence.
