APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 2CCV-21-0000161(3)) 
ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Hiraoka and McCullen, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of the Motion for Order Dismissing 
Appeal, filed on January 11, 2022, by Plaintiff-Appellee 
Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, the papers in support and in opposition, and the record, it appears we lack appellate jurisdiction over self-represented Defendant-Appellant Michael Henry Marcol's (Marcol
) appeal from the Circuit Court of the 
Second Circuit's (circuit court) August 26, 2021 Order Denying 
[Marcol]'s 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss Complaint for Money 
Judgment, Filed August 3, 2021 (Order) because the circuit court 
has not entered a final, appealable judgment, and the Order is 
not independently appealable.  See Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright
, 76 Hawai# i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994) 
(holding that an aggrieved party cannot obtain appellate review of a circuit court's interlocutory orders in a civil case, under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-1(a) (2016), until the NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
circuit court has reduced its dispositive rulings to an 
appealable, final judgment under Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure 
Rule 58 or Rule 54(b)); 
Greer v. Baker
, 137 Hawai# i 249, 253, 369 
P.3d 832, 836 (2016) (reciting the requirements for appeals under the collateral-order doctrine and the 
Forgay doctrine); HRS 
ยง 641-1(b) (2016) (setting forth the requirements for leave to file an interlocutory appeal). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion to 
dismiss is granted and the appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are 
dismissed. 
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, February 11, 2022.
