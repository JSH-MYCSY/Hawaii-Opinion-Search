NO. CAAP-21-0000500 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
NOE RAQUINIO, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
NORTH AND SOUTH KONA DIVISION 
(CASE NO. 3DCW-21-0001912) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Hiraoka and McCullen, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
appellate jurisdiction over self-represented Defendant-Appellant 
Noe Raquinio's (
Raquinio) appeal from the District Court of the 
Third Circuit's (district court) September 2, 2021 oral denial of 
Raquinio's August 4, 2021 amended motion to suppress evidence 
because the district court has not entered a final, appealable judgment, and the oral order is not appealable.  See State v. Ontiveros
, 82 Hawai# i 446, 449, 923 P.2d 388, 391 (1996) 
("Appeals from the district court, in criminal cases, are authorized by HRS 641-12, which . . . provides in pertinent part that appeals upon the record shall be allowed from all final decisions and final judgments of district courts in all criminal matters.") (cleaned up); 
State v. Bohannon
, 102 Hawai# i 228, 236, 
74 P.3d 980, 988 (2003) ("[T]o appeal a criminal matter in the district court, the appealing party must appeal from a written NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
judgment or order that has been filed with the clerk of the court 
pursuant to [Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure] 
Rule 4(b)(3).") (emphasis in original). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, February 4, 2022.
