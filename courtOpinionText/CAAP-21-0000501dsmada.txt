PPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 2CCV-20-0000330 (1)) 
ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and Nakasone, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of the Motion to Dismiss Appellant's 
Interlocutory Appeal (
Motion), filed on October 19, 2021, by 
Plaintiff-Appellee Natalie Ann James, as Guardian for Scott 
Spencer Stolsig, the papers in support and in opposition, and the record, it appears we lack appellate jurisdiction over Defendant-Appellant Foodland Super Market, Limited's (Foodland) appeal from 
the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit's (circuit court) 
August 10, 2021 "Order Denying [Foodland]'s Motion to Dismiss or, 
Alternatively, for Summary Judgment as to all Claims and Parties Against [Foodland] Filed on May 10, 2021 and Order Granting [Foodland]'s Motion for Hawaii [sic] Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 54(b) Certification" (Order) because the circuit court has 
not entered a final, appealable judgment, and the Order is not 
independently appealable. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
An aggrieved party cannot obtain appellate review of a 
circuit court's interlocutory orders in a civil case, under 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-1(a) (2016), until the 
circuit court has reduced its dispositive rulings to an 
appealable, final judgment under Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure 
(
HRCP) Rule 58. See Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 
76 Hawai# i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994) ("An appeal may 
be taken from circuit court orders resolving claims against parties only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]"). 
Here, the 
circuit court has not entered a final, appealable judgment. 
Further, the Order does not satisfy the requirements 
for an exception to the final-judgment requirement as a prerequisite for an appeal under the collateral-order doctrine, the Forgay doctrine, or HRS ยง 641-1(b). The circuit court purported to certify the Order under HRCP Rule 54(b). 
However, 
the Order does not enter judgment as to any of the claims in the complaint, and Rule 54(b) is inapplicable. See HRCP Rule 54(b). 
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is 
granted and the appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, November 24, 2021.
