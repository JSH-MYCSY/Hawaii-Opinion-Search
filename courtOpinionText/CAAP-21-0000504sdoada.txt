SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.)  
This appeal addresses whether a sentencing enhancement 
factor is an element requiring proof of a state of mind, which 
must be pled in an indictment. 
We hold that it is not. 
Plaintiff-Appellant State of Hawai‘i (State) appeals

September 9, 2021 "Order Granting [Defendant-Appellee Brian Lee 
Smith (Smith)]'s Motion to Strike HRS §706-660.1 Enhancement for 
Counts 1 and 2 Indictment" (Order Granting Motion to Strike), in 
which the Circuit Court ruled that pursuant to State v. Auld, 
136 Hawai‘ i 244, 361 P.3d 471 (2015),  Hawaii Revised Statutes 
(HRS) § 706-660.1  "is an enhancement, and thus an element," 
requiring a state of mind that must be pled in the Indictment. 32
On appeal, the State challenges various conclusions4 
the Circuit Court made in its Order Granting Motion to Strike, 
all of which turn on the dispositive question of whether a sentencing enhancement factor is an element requiring proof of a state of mind. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve the State's challenge as follows, and vacate and remand. 
This is the second appeal from the underlying case, in 
which a jury convicted Smith of second-degree murder in Count 1; the included offense of first-degree reckless endangering (originally attempted second-degree murder) in Count 2; felon in 
2 In Auld, the Hawai‘i Supreme Court held that because mandatory 
minimum sentencing enhancements did "increase the penalty for a crime[,]" the 
predicate facts for such enhancement must be submitted to a jury and such 
allegations must be included in the charging instrument. 136 Hawai‘ i at 247

3 HRS § 706- 660.1 (2014), entitled "Sentence of imprisonment for 
use of a firearm, semiautomatic firearm, or automatic firearm in a felony," 
provides for a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment where "[a] person 
convicted of a felony" possessed, threatened the use of, or used a firearm "while engaged in the commission of the felony[.]" The mandatory minimum 
terms range from 15 years for murder offenses down to three years for the 
lowest felony offense.  Id.

law.

possession of a firearm in Count 4; felon in possession of 
ammunition in Count 5; and using a firearm in the commission of 
a separate felony in Count 6. The convictions stemmed from an 
incident on June 23, 2018, in which Smith shot and killed Thomas Ballesteros, Jr. (Ballesteros), and shot and injured Nikolaus Jason Slavik (Slavik). State v. Smith, NO. CAAP-19-0000490, 
2020 WL 5122952, at *1 (Haw. App. Aug. 31, 2020) (mem. op.). Smith appealed his 2019 convictions in a prior appeal, CAAP-19-0000490, on numerous grounds unrelated to the issue presented in this appeal. See id. at *2. This court affirmed 
Smith's convictions in Counts 4 and 5, and vacated the convictions in Counts 1, 2 and 6, and remanded for further proceedings. Id. at *8. 
On remand, Smith filed the motion relevant to this 
appeal, to strike the HRS § 706-660.1 sentencing enhancement 
language in Counts 1 and 2. In the State's July 9, 2018 
Indictment, both the charge of second-degree murder against Ballesteros in Count 1, and the original charge of attempted second-degree murder against Slavik in Count 2, identically alleged the sentencing enhancement as follows: 
COUNT 1 (C18017673/KN) 
On or about the 23rd day of June, 2018, in Kona, 
County and State of Hawai‘i, BRIAN LEE SMITH intentionally 
or knowingly caused the death of another person, THOMAS 
BALLESTEROS, JR., thereby committing the offense of Murder 
in the Second Degree, in violation of Section 707- 701.5(1), 
[HRS], as amended. It is further alleged that 
[Smith] is 
subject to sentencing in accordance with Section 706- 660.1, 
[HRS], where he had a firearm in his possession or 
threatened its use or used the firearm while engaged in the 
commission of the felony offense, whether the firearm was loaded or not, and whether operable or not.

 On or about the 23rd day of June, 2018, in Ko na, 
County and State of Hawai‘ i,  BRIAN LEE SMITH intentionally 
engaged in conduct, which, under the circumstances  
as he believed them to be, constituted a substanti al step 
in the course of conduct  intended to culminate in his 
commission of the crime of Murder in the Second Degree,  
said crime being intentionally or knowingly caused the 
death of another person,  NIKOLAUS SLAVIK, thereby 
committing the offense of Attempted Murder in the Second  
Degree, in violation of Section 705- 500 and 707
-701.5, 
[HRS], as amended.   It is further alleged that [Smith] is 
subject to sentencing in accordance  with Section 706- 660.1, 
[HRS], where he had a firearm in his possession or 
threatened its use or used the firearm while engaged in the 
commission of the felony offense, whether the firearm was 
loaded or not, and whether operable or not.  
 
  On September 9, 2021, the Circuit Court filed the 
Order Granting Motion to Strike, in which it concluded that: 
"HRS §706-660.1 is an enhancement, and thus an element, pursuant to the holding of State v. Auld"; and that the "complaint in this case fail[ed] to state what the state of mind is for the elements of HRS §706-660.1." The State timely appealed.

COUNT 2 (C18017740/KN) 
(Emphases added.) Relying on Auld, 136 Hawai‘ i 244, 361 P.3d 
471, Smith argued the State failed to allege "the applicable state of mind with respect to sentencing enhancements . . . in [the] charging instrument" because the sentencing enhancement statute is an "element"; and HRS § 702-204  requires a state of 
mind for "each element of the offense." The State opposed, on grounds that no case law or statute required enhancements under HRS § 706-660.1 to include a mens rea; that "enhancements aren't  
elements"; and that Auld only held that "enhancements have to be part of the charge" and did not require a mens rea. 
5
5 HRS § 702- 204 (2014), entitled "State of mind required," provides 
that "a person is not guilty of an offense unless the person acted 
intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, or negligently, as the law specifies, 
with respect to each element of the offense. "  (Emphasis added.) 
4  
           
 
 
  
 On appeal, the State argues that HRS Chapter 702 does 
not apply to HRS § 706-660.1, because the latter statute "is not 
charging an offense" and is "intended only to be a sentencing 
enhancement factor." The State contends the Circuit Court's reliance on Auld was incorrect, and that under State v. Wagner, 
139 Hawai‘ i 475, 394 P.3d 705 (2017), "sentencing enhancement 
factors are not elements under the meaning of HRS §702-205, and 
thus HRS §702-204 does not apply."  These arguments have merit.

In Wagner
, the Hawai‘i Supreme Court held that a 
sentencing enhancement factor is "not an element of the 
offense." 139 Hawai‘i at 480-82, 394 P.3d at 710-12. Wagner
involved the imposition of a mandatory minimum term of 
imprisonment pursuant to a specific provision for such sentencing in the first-degree methamphetamine trafficking statute, HRS § 712-1240.7, based on a prior felony conviction. Id. at 476-77, 394 P.3d at 706-07. On appeal, the defendant argued that he was prejudiced by the introduction of his prior conviction at trial, and that his stipulation to the fact of his prior conviction "should have 'effectively removed that element of the crime from the charge.'" Id. at 479, 394 P.3d at 709 
(brackets omitted). The supreme court held, inter alia, that 
the circuit court erred by treating the defendant's prior conviction "as an element of the offense, rather than a sentencing enhancement factor." Id. at 480, 394 P.3d at 710. 
Smith's reliance on 
Auld is misplaced because Auld did 
not hold that sentencing enhancement factors were "elements" 
6 HRS § 702- 205 (2014), entitled " Elements of an offense," 
provides: "The elements of an offense are such (1) conduct, (2) attendant 
circumstances, and (3) results of conduct, as: (a) Are specified by the 
definition of the offense, and (b) Negative a defense . . . ." (Emphasis 
added.)

within the meaning of HRS § 702-204. Rather, Auld simply 
required the facts supporting the enhancement to be alleged in 
the charging document and submitted to the jury. See 136 Hawai‘ i 
at 247-48, 257, 361 P.3d 474-75, 484. 
Here, the sentencing enhancement under HRS § 706-660.1 
for using a firearm in the commission of a felony is not an 
element of the underlying offenses in Counts 1 and 2, but only applies post-conviction, after the defendant "is convicted of a 
felony[,]" meaning the elements of the predicate offenses are 
already proven. 
See Wagner, 139 Hawai‘ i at 480-85, 394 P.3d at 
710-15. 
HRS § 706-660.1 applies within a post-conviction 
sentencing context, after "[a] person [is] convicted of a 
felony," and is one of the numerous sentencing dispositions under HRS Chapter 706 governing "Disposition of Convicted 
Defendants." The factual predicate that a firearm be used in 
the commission of a felony offense for sentencing under HRS § 706-660.1 is not the equivalent of an element of an offense to which the state of mind requirements under HRS §§ 702-204 and 
702-205 apply. See Barker v. Young, 153 Hawai‘ i 144, 148, 
528 P.3d 217, 221 (2023) ("Statutory interpretation is a 
question of law reviewable de novo." (citation omitted)). The 
Circuit Court's conclusions in this regard were error. See
State v. Rodrigues, 145 Hawai‘ i 487, 494, 454 P.3d 428, 435 
(2019) (reviewing conclusions of law de novo). 
Because the sentencing enhancement factor under HRS 
§ 706-660.1 is not an element of an offense that requires a 
state of mind, a state of mind for the HRS § 706-660.1 
enhancement was not required to be pled in the Indictment, and the Circuit Court erroneously granted the Motion to Strike the sentencing enhancements in Counts 1 and 2. Cf. State v. Tran,

whether a charge sets forth all the essential elements of a 
charged offense is a question of law that this court reviews de novo under the right/wrong standard."

For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the September 9, 
2021 Order Granting Motion to Strike, filed by the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Summary Disposition Order.
