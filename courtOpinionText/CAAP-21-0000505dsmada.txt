NO. CAAP-21-0000505 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
In the Matter of the Tax Appeal of DLMC, INC.,
dba KAMA# AINA HEALTHCARE SERVICES, 
DLMC, INC., dba 
KAMA# AINA HEALTHCARE SERVICES, Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI# I DEPARTMENT OF TAXATION, Appellee 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL WITHOUT PREJUIDCE 
(By: 
Leonard, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Nakasone, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that: 
(1) On September 16, 2021, DLMC, Inc. dba Kama# aina  
Healthcare Services (DLMC) filed, through its attorney Kalani A. 
Morse (Morse), a "Notice of Appeal to Tax Appeal Court" (Notice 
of Appeal) in this court, commencing the instant case; 
(2)
 In the Notice of Appeal, DLMC appears to seek 
appellate relief from the Tax Appeal Court of the State of 
Hawai# i (Tax Appeal Court), and not from this court. It thus 
appears that DLMC intended to file the Notice of Appeal with the 
Tax Appeal Court but inadvertently filed the Notice of Appeal in this court;
1 
(3) DLMC and the State of Hawai# i Department of 
Taxation (Department of Taxation) subsequently filed other 
documents in this case that pertain to the Notice of Appeal and 
thus also appear to be inadvertently filed in this court; and 
1 Morse is cautioned to ensure that documents are filed with the proper
court.

(4) Documents filed by DLMC and the Department of 
Taxation in this case should thus be transferred to the Tax 
Appeal Court pursuant to Hawai# i Court Records Rules Rule 3.3, 
and the instant case, Case No. CAAP-21-0000505, should be dismissed without prejudice. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appellate 
clerk shall electronically send all documents filed in Case No. CAAP-21-0000505 to the clerk of the Tax Appeal Court. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the appeal in Case No. CAAP-
21-0000505 is dismissed without prejudice. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the appellate clerk shall 
serve a copy of this order on the clerk of the Tax Appeal Court.
