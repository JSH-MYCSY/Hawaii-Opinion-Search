filed on September 9, 2021 (Judgment), in the District Court of 
the Second Circuit (District Court).1/  After a bench trial, 
Sauceda was convicted of Excessive Speeding, in violation of 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291C-105(a)(1) (2020).2/ 
1/ The Honorable Kirstin M. Hamman presided.

Saucedo raises a single point of error on appeal, 
contending that there was no substantial evidence to support his 
conviction because Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai# i (the 
State) failed to lay the requisite foundation for the admission 
of the laser gun speed reading. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve Sauceda's point of error as follows: 
Sauceda contends that the District Court abused its 
discretion in admitting the testimony of Maui Police Department 
Officer Stephen Kelley (Officer Kelley) regarding the subject 
speed reading because the State failed to lay sufficient 
foundation for the testimony.  However, as the State argues, the trial transcript shows no objection or motion to strike based on lack of foundation at the time that Officer Kelley testified about the speed readout for Saucedo's vehicle.  It was not until trial resumed, almost two months later, that Sauceda raised lack of foundation and moved to strike the speed readout.  The State argued that the objection and motion to strike were very untimely.  The District Court overruled Sauceda's objection and denied the motion to strike.

In Lee v. Elbaum, 77 Hawai# i 446, 449, 887 P.2d 656, 
659 (App. 1993), this court held:  "In order for an objection or 
motion to strike to be 'timely' for purposes of Hawai# i Rules of 
Evidence (HRE) 103(a), the objection to evidence must be made 
when offered or when the grounds for objection become apparent, 
or they are deemed waived on appeal."  (Bolding added).  The court explained: 
[HRE] 103(a) expressly provides that: 
Error may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits
. . . evidence unless a substantial right of the partyis affected, and: 
(1) Objection:  In case the ruling is one admitting
evidence, a timely objection or motion to strike
appears of record, stating the specific ground ofobjection, if the ground was not apparent from thecontext[.] 
HRE 103(a)(1) is identical to Federal Rules of Evidence(FRE) 103(a)(1).  HRE 103 Commentary.  In discussing thefederal rule, Professors Wright and Graham state: 
Rule 103(a)(1) requires that an objection be "timely." The sanction for failure to make a timely objection isthe familiar sanction of nullity:  that is, theuntimely objection will be deemed to be no objection
at all for purposes of review[.] 
. . . . In administering the requirement that an objection be
timely, the courts must consider both fairness andefficiency.  The objector ought not to be held to animpossible standard such as requiring an objectionbefore the ground becomes apparent to him.  The opponent is entitled to have the objection raised at atime that permits him to best obviate the objection. Considerations of efficiency suggest that theobjection should be made before time has been wastedintroducing the evidence and while the court has somemeans of effectuating the objection that is moreeffective than ordering the jury to disregard the
evidence.  In each case, the court must balance these
factors in arriving at a conclusion as to when theobjection is timely made.

A good rule of thumb is found in Wigmore's Code: 
An objection must be made as soon as the ground
of it is known, or could reasonably have been
known to the objector, unless  some special
reason makes its postponement desirable for him
and not unfair to the officer . . . . 
This is usually taken to mean that objections totestimony must be made after the question but beforethe answer . 
. . . . 
Of course, the motion to strike must also be timely. 
It should be made as soon as the ground for objection
becomes apparent.  The trial judge has discretion to
entertain an untimely motion to strike, but if he
refuses to do so, the objector cannot raise the pointon appeal. 
21 C. Wright and K. Graham, Federal Practice and Procedure: 
Evidence § 5037 at 187–90 (1977) (footnotes omitted). 
The Hawai #i Supreme Court has not had occasion
to determine what constitutes a "timely" objection ormotion to strike for HRE 103 purposes.  However, othercourts have generally held that objections to evidencemust be made when offered or when the grounds forobjection become apparent, or they are deemed waivedon appeal. 
In Wagner v. Wagner, 1 Wash. App. 328, 461 P.2d 577(1969), for example, the Washington Court of Appeals
held that where allegedly improper testimony was not
objected to until well into cross-examination, any
error that may have occurred was waived .  1 Wash. App.
at 333, 461 P.2d at 580.  See also Blue Cross of 
Western New York v. Bukulmez, 736 P.2d 834, 838 (Colo.
1987), Attorney Gen. of State v. New Mexico Pub. Serv.
Comm’n, 101 N.M. 549, 552–53, 685 P.2d 957, 960–61(1984), Belmont Indus., Inc. v. Bethlehem Steel Corp.,512 F.2d 434, 437 (3d Cir. 1975).  
Id. at 452-53, 887 P.2d at 662-63 (Emphasis added). 
Here, Sauceda objected to admission of the speed 
reading from the laser device almost two months after the 
evidence was admitted, at the end of Officer Kelley's cross-examination, well after it was offered or an objection for lack foundation should have been apparent.  The District Court 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
rejected Sauceda's untimely objection and motion to strike.  The 
objection is waived on appeal. 
Sauceda raises no other points of error.  Given the 
speed reading, when the evidence adduced in the trial court is considered in the strongest light for the prosecution, State v. Matavale, 115 
Hawai# i 149, 157-58, 166 P.3d 322, 330-31 (2007), 
there was substantial evidence to support Sauceda's conviction for Excessive Speeding. 
Accordingly, the District Court's September 9, 2021 
Judgment is affirmed.
