NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
NO. CAAP-21-0000524 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
IN THE MATTER OF ADOPTION OF LI 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(FC-A NO. 21-1-6112) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and Nakasone, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
jurisdiction over the appeal by Aunt-Intervenor-Appellant (Aunt) 
from the Family Court of the First Circuit's (family court) 
September 10, 2021 Findings and Order Setting Further Hearing 
(Order), because the family court has not entered a final, 
appealable order or judgment, and the Order is not independently 
appealable. 
In general, appeals in family court cases, as in other 
civil cases, may be taken only from (1) a final judgment, order, or decree, see Hawaii Revised Statutes (
HRS) §§ 571–54 (2018), 
641–1(a) (2016), or (2) a certified interlocutory order. See
 HRS 
§ 641–1(b) (2016). The very nature of a family court chapter 587 proceeding entails "an on-going case which does not result in a 'final' order, as that term is generally defined[,]" In re Doe
, 
77 Hawai# i 109, 114, 883 P.2d 30, 35 (1994) (citation omitted), 
because, under HRS chapter 587, the family court retains continuing jurisdiction over the case to prevent future harm or threatened harm to a child. Thus, in such family court cases, the court considers whether the particular order appealed from NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
contains a sufficient "degree of finality" to establish appellate 
jurisdiction. Id. at 115, 883 P.2d at 36. A "final order" means 
an order ending the proceeding, leaving nothing further to be accomplished. Familian Nw., Inc. v. Cent. Pac. Boiler & Piping, 
Ltd., 68 Haw. 368, 370, 714 P.2d 936, 937 (1986). 
Here, it appears that the Order does not contain a 
sufficient degree of finality to establish appellate jurisdiction because although it finds that it is in LI's best interest to be adopted by Resource Caregiver-Petitioner-Appellee (RCG) and 
schedules an adoption hearing for September 29, 2021, it does not 
finalize adoption of LI by RCG. Further, it appears that the Order is not appealable under the collateral-order doctrine because it does not fully resolve a matter completely separate from the main issue, and Aunt may appeal from the Order once the family court enters a final, appealable order or judgment granting a petition for adoption by RCG. See Greer v. Baker
, 137 
Hawai# i 249, 254, 369 P.3d 832, 837 (2016) (setting forth the 
requirements for appealability under the collateral-order doctrine). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal in 
CAAP-21-0000524 is dismissed. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are 
dismissed.
