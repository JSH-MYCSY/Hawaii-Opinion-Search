GINOZA, CHIEF JUDGE, HIRAOKA AND WADSWORTH, JJ. 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY HIRAOKA, J. 
Self-represented Petitioner-Appellant Walter N. Guity 
petitioned the Circuit Court  of the First Circuit,1 under Hawaii 
Revised Statutes ( HRS) Chapter 661B, for redress for wrongful 
conviction and imprisonment. Respondent-Appellee State of

and entered judgment in the State's favor, against Guity. Guity

appeals. We hold that Guity's petition satisfied the pleading 
requirements of HRS § 661B-1(b)(1) as to one of his convictions, but not the other. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment; vacate in part the Circuit Court's order dismissing Guity's petition; and remand for further proceedings. 
I. BACKGROUND 
The facts underlying Guity's petition were recited in 
State v. Guity
, 144 Hawai#i 557, 445 P.3d 138 (2019) ( Guity II ). 
In May 2010 Guity was indicted on multiple counts, including attempted sexual assault in the first degree (the Family Court 
Case
).2 The complaining witness in the Family Court Case was 
Guity's wife. In March 2011 Guity was indicted on multiple counts of sexual assault of a different woman (the Circuit Court 
Case).
3 
Guity agreed to enter pleas in both cases. In the 
Family Court Case, he pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of Sexual Assault in the Third Degree. In the Circuit Court Case, he pleaded guilty to one count of Sexual Assault in the Second 
2 We judicially notice the documents filed in the Family Court Case
pursuant to Rule 201, Hawaii Rules of Evidence, Chapter 626, Hawaii Revised
Statutes (2016). The counts alleged in the indictment were: (1) Abuse ofFamily or Household Members in violation of HRS § 709-906; (2) TerroristicThreatening in the Second Degree in violation of HRS § 707-717(1);(3) Kidnapping in violation of HRS § 707-720(1)(d); (4) and (5) AttemptedSexual Assault in the First Degree in violation of HRS §§ 705-500 and707-730(1)(a); and (6) Interference with Reporting an Emergency or Crime inviolation of HRS § 710-1010.5(1). 
3 We also judicially notice the documents filed in the Circuit Court
Case. The counts alleged in the indictment were: (1), (2), and (3) SexualAssault in the Second Degree in violation of HRS § 707-731(1)(a); and (4),(5), and (6) Sexual Assault in the Fourth Degree in violation of HRS § 707-733(1)(a).

Degree. The State agreed to dismiss all remaining counts in the 
Family Court Case and the Circuit Court Case. 
Before he was sentenced, Guity moved to withdraw his 
guilty pleas. The trial court denied Guity's motion. Guity was sentenced to concurrent prison terms of 12 months for the Family Court Case and 18 months for the Circuit Court Case.
4 
Guity appealed. We held that Guity should have been 
allowed to withdraw his guilty plea in the Family Court Case because, under the law at that time, the offense of sexual assault in the third degree could not be committed by a defendant against their spouse.
5 State v. Guity, No. CAAP-12-0000287, 2016 
WL 6427681, at *6-7 (Haw. App. Oct. 31, 2016), as amended , 
(Nov. 21, 2016) (mem.) ( Guity I), vacated on other grounds by 
Guity II. We also held that the trial court failed to obtain a valid waiver of Guity's right to counsel before the hearing on his motion to withdraw his guilty pleas. Id. at *9. We vacated the convictions and remanded for further proceedings. 
Guity applied for a writ of certiorari. In Guity II 
the supreme court held that Guity should have been allowed to withdraw his guilty plea in the Circuit Court Case as well as the Family Court Case, because the pleas were part of a global plea agreement. 144 
Hawai#i at 558, 563, 445 P.3d at 139, 144. The 
4 Guity contends, and the State doesn't dispute, that he served the
full term of his sentences. See State v. Guity , No. CAAP-12-0000287, 2016 WL
6427681, at *6 n.6 (Haw. App. Oct. 31, 2016), as amended , (Nov. 21, 2016)
(mem.) ( Guity I) ("It appears that by the time briefing in this appeal was
completed, Guity had completed serving his concurrent terms of imprisonment on
both convictions."), vacated on other grounds by Guity II  .

6427681, at *1 n.1. 
3 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
supreme court remanded both cases "with instructions to accept 
Guity's withdrawal of both pleas and for further proceedings consistent with this opinion." Id. at 563-64, 445 P.3d at 144-45. 
On remand in the Family Court Case, Guity moved to 
dismiss Counts 2, 3, 4, and 5 because of defects in the indictment. The trial court granted the motion and dismissed Counts 2, 3, 4, and 5 without prejudice. The State moved to nolle prosequi Counts 1 and 6 without prejudice "on the ground that Counts 2-5 were dismissed without prejudice[.]" The trial court granted the motion. The crime for which Guity pleaded guilty and was convicted (sexual assault in the third degree) wasn't charged in the indictment. 
On remand in the Circuit Court Case, Guity moved to 
dismiss all six counts because of defects in the indictment. The trial court granted the motion "with prejudice, as the State can no longer prosecute the case due to lack of contact with the complainant." 
Guity filed the petition below on May 14, 2021. He 
sought redress from the State for wrongful convictions and imprisonment under HRS Chapter 661B. The State moved to dismiss the petition or, alternatively, for summary judgment. The Circuit Court granted the motion. It ruled: 
3. The court's analysis is straight-forward. HRS 
Section 661B-1 is clear. To present an actionable claim
against the State for wrongful conviction and imprisonment,Mr. Guity must allege that he was convicted, was sentenced,and was imprisoned, and that his judgment of conviction was
reversed because he was actually innocent of the crimes forwhich he was convicted, and the court decision so states  (or 
4 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the petitioner was pardoned and the pardon so states)
(emphasis added). 
4. There is no dispute that Mr. Guity obtained
dismissal of a charge against him. However, it is alsoundisputed that no court decision connected with thedismissal states he was actually innocent. Mr. Guity arguesthat the presumption of innocence should apply. Mr. Guityis absolutely correct that he is presumed innocent in thecontext of the criminal justice system. But he is now in a different arena -- asserting a civil claim for damages. HRS Section 661B-1 controls civil claims for wrongfulimprisonment. The presumption of innocence that cloaksMr. Guity in a criminal case does not apply in civillitigation. The statute clearly states and is clearlyintended to limit financial claims against the State tosituations where there is an actual and express finding ofactual innocence by the court considering the criminal case. 
A written order was entered on October 27, 2021. 
This appeal followed. After briefing was completed, we 
entered an order under Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
(HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4)6 for supplemental briefing on whether HRS 
§ 661B-3(b)(1)7 should be applied in this appeal. Both parties 
filed timely supplemental briefs. 
6 HRAP Rule 28(b)(4) provides, in relevant part: 
If an appellate court, when acting on a case on appeal,
contemplates basing the disposition of the case wholly or inpart upon an issue of plain error not raised by the partiesthrough briefing, it shall not affirm, reverse, or vacatethe case without allowing the parties the opportunity tobrief the potential plain-error issue prior to disposition. 
7 HRS § 661B-3 (2016) provides, in relevant part: 
(b) The following shall be affirmative defenses, on which the
State shall have the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence: 
(1) The petitioner was serving a term of imprisonment for
another crime, including crimes under the laws of theUnited States, concurrently with imprisonment for thecrime or crimes for which petitioner was actuallyinnocent[.]

II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A. Motion to Dismiss 
"A circuit court's ruling on a motion to dismiss is 
reviewed de novo." Bank of Am., N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo , 143 
Hawai#i 249, 256, 428 P.3d 761, 768 (2018) (citation omitted). 
We apply the same standard applied by the circuit court: 
[A] complaint should not be dismissed for failure to
state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that theplaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of hisor her claim that would entitle him or her to relief. The appellate court must therefore view a plaintiff'scomplaint in a light most favorable to him or her inorder to determine whether the allegations containedtherein could warrant relief under any alternativetheory. For this reason, in reviewing a circuitcourt's order dismissing a complaint . . . theappellate court's consideration is strictly limited tothe allegations of the complaint, and the appellatecourt must deem those allegations to be true. 
Id. at 257, 428 P.3d at 769 (citation omitted). "However, in 
weighing the allegations of the complaint as against a motion to dismiss, the court is not required to accept conclusory allegations on the legal effect of the events alleged." Kealoha v. Machado, 131 
Hawai#i 62, 74, 315 P.3d 213, 225 (2013) 
(citation omitted). 
The State's motion to dismiss included five exhibits 
that were not excluded by the Circuit Court. That would ordinarily have converted the motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment. See 
Hawai#i Rules of Civil Procedure ( HRCP) 
Rule 12(b); Andrade v. County of Hawai #i, 145 Hawai #i 265, 268-69, 
451 P.3d 1, 4-5 (App. 2019). The exhibits, however, consisted of our memorandum opinion in Guity I; the supreme court opinion in Guity II; and findings of fact, conclusions of law, and orders 
6 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
entered on remand in the Family Court Case and the Circuit Court 
Case. Hawaii Rules of Evidence Rule 201 permits a court to notice adjudicative facts if they are "not subject to reasonable dispute." "The most frequent use of judicial notice of ascertainable facts is in noticing the contents of court records." Uyeda v. Schermer, 144 
Hawai#i 163, 172, 439 P.3d 115, 
124 (2019) (citation omitted).8 A trial court may judicially 
notice the contents of court records without converting a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment. See Khoja v. Orexigen Therapeutics, Inc., 899 F.3d 988, 999 (9th Cir. 2018).
9  
Accordingly, we apply the standard of review applicable to HRCP Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss. 
8 However: a distinction must be carefully drawn between taking
judicial notice of the existence of documents in the Courtfile as opposed to the truth of the facts asserted in thosedocuments. Factual allegations, conclusions, and findings,whether authored by the court, by the parties or theirattorneys, or by third persons, should not be noticed toprove the truth of the matters asserted even though thematerial happens to be contained in court records. A court may only take judicial notice of the truth of facts assertedin documents such as orders, judgments, and findings of factand conclusions of law because of the principles ofcollateral estoppel, res judicata, and the law of the case. 
Uyeda, 144 Hawai#i at 172, 439 P.3d at 124 (cleaned up) (emphasis omitted). 
9 Although cases interpreting provisions of the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure and Federal Rules of Evidence are not binding upon us, we mayrefer to them for their persuasive authority in interpreting the Hawai #i Rules 
of Civil Procedure and Hawaii Rules of Evidence. Ralston v. Yim, 129 Hawai i #
46, 57 n.15, 292 P.3d 1276, 1287 n.15 (2013) (noting Hawai #i courts "can look 
to cases interpreting the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for persuasiveguidance." (citation omitted)); State v. Fitzwater, 122 Hawai #i 354, 366 n.7,
227 P.3d 520, 532 n.7 (2010) ("Although cases interpreting provisions in theFederal Rules of Evidence are . . . not binding on us, we may refer to them
for persuasive authority in interpreting similar provisions of the Hawaii
Rules of Evidence." (citation omitted)). 
7 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
B. Statutory Interpretation 
Interpretation of a statute is a question of law 
reviewed de novo. Barker v. Young, 153 Hawai#i 144, 148, 528 
P.3d 217, 221 (2023). We start with the statute's language; 
"implicit in the task of statutory construction is our foremost obligation to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the language contained in the statute itself." Id. (citation omitted). But "when there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or indistinctiveness or uncertainty of an expression used in a statute, . . . the meaning of the ambiguous words may be sought by examining the context, with which the ambiguous words, phrases, and sentences may be compared, in order to ascertain their true meaning." Id. (citation omitted). We may also "resort to extrinsic aids in determining legislative intent, such as legislative history, or the reason and spirit of the law." Id. (citation omitted). 
III.
 DISCUSSION 
Guity argues that the Circuit Court erred by granting 
the State's motion to dismiss "because Guity's case met all the grounds according to the legislative statue [sic]."
10 HRS

Statement of claim for compensation.  (a) Any person
convicted in a court of the State and imprisoned for one or
more crimes of which the person was actually innocent  may 
10 Guity's opening brief doesn't comply with HRAP Rule 28(b). But to 
promote access to justice, the supreme court instructs that self-representedlitigants shouldn't be foreclosed from appellate review because they fail to
comply with court rules. Erum v. Llego, 147 Hawai#i 368, 380-81, 465 P.3d
815, 827-28 (2020). Accordingly, we address what we discern to be Guity'sarguments.

file a petition for relief pursuant to this chapter for an
award of damages against the State; provided that therequirements of subsection (b) are met. 
(b) To present an actionable claim against the State
for wrongful conviction and imprisonment, the petitionershall allege that the petitioner was convicted of one ormore crimes under the laws of the State, was subsequently
sentenced to a term of imprisonment, and has served all or
any part of the sentence and either that: 
(1) The judgment of conviction was reversed or
vacated because the petitioner was actually
innocent  of the crimes for which the petitioner
was convicted, and the court decision so states ; 
or 
(2) The petitioner was pardoned because the
petitioner was actually innocent of the crimesfor which the petitioner was convicted and thepardon so states. 
(Bold italics added.) 
Guity's petition, written in the first person, alleged 
that he was convicted and sentenced in the Family Court Case and 
in the Circuit Court Case; served his sentences; appealed his convictions; the convictions were vacated "because I was innocent of the crimes for which I was convicted"; and both cases were dismissed on remand. 
The State argues that "[t]he Hawai #i Supreme Court 
vacated Guity's conviction because the circuit court wrongly refused to let him withdraw his guilty plea. It made no finding of 'actual innocence[,]'" nor did its opinion "so state[]." The State also argues that "actually innocent" is a legal term of art meaning "factual innocence, not mere legal insufficiency[,]" and that a person is "actually innocent" if "they did not commit the underlying conduct upon which their conviction was based." 
9 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
A. The legislature did not define the phrase
"actually innocent" and the legislativehistory does not provide definitive guidance. 
HRS Chapter 661B doesn't define the phrase "actually 
innocent." The State contends the phrase is a legal term of art 
meaning "factual innocence, not mere legal insufficiency." The State appears to be referring to federal habeas corpus law.
11 A 
state prisoner who is procedurally unable to obtain habeas relief from the state's highest court may seek relief from a federal court if the petitioner demonstrates that a "constitutional violation has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent [.]" Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 496, 106 
S. Ct. 2639, 91 L. Ed. 2d 397 (1986) (emphasis added). In such a case, "failure to consider the claim[] will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice." Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 750, 111 S. Ct. 2546, 115 L. Ed. 2d 640 (1991). The miscarriage of justice exception applies only in extraordinary cases, and "'actual innocence' means factual innocence, not mere legal insufficiency." Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S. 614, 
11 The State's brief cites Williams v. United States, 568 F. Supp. 3d
1115 (W.D. Wash. 2021), a federal habeas case, and In re Allen, 366 S.W.3d 696
(Tex. 2012). Under the Texas wrongful imprisonment statute, "[a] person isentitled to compensation if the person 1) has served in whole or in part asentence in prison under the laws of this state, and 2) has been grantedhabeas relief on a court determination that he is 'actually innocent' of thecrime for which he was sentenced." In re Allen, 366 S.W.3d at 700.

623, 118 S. Ct. 1604, 140 L. Ed. 2d 828 (1998).12 HRS Chapter 
661B doesn't mention federal law on habeas relief. Nor does the 
legislative history mention federal habeas law. 
HRS Chapter 661B was enacted on June 29, 2016. 2016 
Haw. Sess. Laws Act 156, § 5 at 513. The bill for Act 156 (2016) had been introduced during the previous legislative session. H.B. 1046, 28th Leg., Reg. Sess. (2015).
13 The bill was carried 
12 Even under federal law, "actual innocence" doesn't always mean
that the defendant did not commit the crime of which they were convicted. In 
federal habeas cases when the petitioner challenges a state death penalty,"actual innocence" is established by showing that but for a constitutionalerror, no reasonable juror would have found the petitioner eligible for the
death penalty  under the applicable state law. Sawyer v. Whitley , 505 U.S.
333, 336, 112 S. Ct. 2514, 120 L. Ed. 2d 269 (1992). 
13 The bill proposed this language: 
(b) To present an actionable claim against the State forwrongful conviction and imprisonment, the claimant shallallege: 
(1) That the claimant has been convicted of one or 
more crimes, was subsequently sentenced to aterm of imprisonment, and has served all or anypart of the sentence, under the laws of this
State; 
(2) On grounds consistent with innocence and
supported by findings that clearly state such
consistency, for the crime or crimes which theclaimant was sentenced: 
(A) That the claimant was pardoned for the
crime or crimes; 
(B) That the judgment of conviction was
reversed or vacated; and: (i) The accusatory instrument was
dismissed; or 
(ii) If a new trial was ordered, either
the claimant was found not guilty at
the new trial or the claimant was not retried and the accusatoryinstrument was dismissed; or 
(C) The statute, or application thereof, on
which the accusatory instrument was based,violated the constitution of the United States or the State of Hawaii;

The AJS committee's co-chair submitted written

See Conf. Comm. Rep.

Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Texas, 
Washington, and the District of Columbia, but our statute appears to be uniquely worded. 
The legislative committee reports don't clearly state 
what the phrase "actually innocent" was intended to mean, either. But they do give some indication of the general legislative intent. The House Committee on Judiciary reported: 
Your Committee finds that compensation for wrongful
imprisonment generates many viewpoints about the State's
responsibility in these circumstances. Wrongful convictionsand the subsequent incarcerations may be the result of manyfactors, including eyewitness misidentification, falseconfessions, improper forensic science, and governmentmisconduct. The conundrum confronting any compensationscheme is to identify deserving individuals who are innocentof crimes from those who are not. 
. . . . 
Upon careful consideration, your Committee has amended
this measure by deleting its contents and inserting the
language of H.B. No. 1046, H.D. 1, Proposed, which providescompensation and expungement of conviction to persons whocan demonstrate that they were wrongfully convicted and
imprisoned when actually innocent . 
H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 411-16, in 2016 House Journal, at 903

Further, the Conference Committee reported, in relevant 
part: 
The purpose of this measure is to provide compensation
and expungement of conviction to persons who can demonstrate 
they were wrongfully convicted and imprisoned when actually
innocent . 
. . . . 
Innocent persons  who have been wrongly convicted of
crimes and subsequently imprisoned have been uniquely
victimized, have distinct challenges re-entering society,and have difficulty achieving legal redress due to a varietyof substantive and technical obstacles in the law. . . . Your Committee on Conference finds that these individuals deserve a process of redress over and above the existingtort remedies to seek compensation for damages from thejurisdiction that wrongly convicted and imprisoned them. 
Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 146-16, in 2016 House Journal, at 1410 
(emphasis added).21 
With this in mind, we address the convictions at issue 
in Guity's HRS Chapter 661B petition. 
B. The Circuit Court erred by dismissing Guity's
petition with respect to the Family Court
Case. 
Guity pleaded guilty to, was convicted of, and was 
imprisoned for 12 months for, Sexual Assault in the Third Degree, 
in violation of former HRS § 707-732(1)(f) (Supp. 2009). The statute provided, in relevant part: 
(1) A person commits the offense of sexual assault in the
third degree if: . . . . (f) The person knowingly, by strong compulsion, has
sexual contact  with another person or causes
another person to have sexual contact with the
actor.

(Emphasis added.) When Guity was convicted, "sexual contact" 
meant: 
any touching, other than acts of "sexual penetration", [sic]
of the sexual or other intimate parts of a person not
married to the actor , or of the sexual or other intimate
parts of the actor by the person, whether directly orthrough the clothing or other material intended to cover thesexual or other intimate parts. 
HRS § 707-700 (Supp. 2009) (emphasis added). 
The complainant in the Family Court Case was Guity's 
wife. In Guity I we stated: 
Under the law applicable to the charges in Guity's
cases, the offense of third-degree sexual assault to whichGuity pleaded guilty could not be committed by a defendantagainst his or her spouse. . . . Accordingly, given theLegislature's definition of the offense, Guity pleadedguilty to an offense — third-degree sexual assault againsthis wife — that was legally impossible  for Guity to commit.

Here, the Circuit Court clearly violated [ Hawai#i 
Rules of Penal Procedure] Rule 11(g) in entering judgment onGuity's plea of guilty to third-degree sexual assault of hiswife. Not only did the Circuit Court and the parties knowthat there was no factual basis  for Guity's guilty plea to
third-degree sexual assault, but they affirmatively knewthat it was legally impossible  for Guity to have committed
this offense. . . . 
. . . [A] court's acceptance of, and entry of judgment
on, a guilty plea to an offense that it knows the defendantcould not legally commit implicates the integrity of the
judicial system . We conclude that allowing such action by a
court would be contrary to the truth-seeking function of thecriminal justice system and would serve to undermine the 
integrity of the system and public confidence in the system . 
Id. at *7-8 (emphasis added). Accordingly, we vacated Guity's 
conviction in the Family Court Case. 
The supreme court also stated, in Guity II : 
At the time of the plea agreement, it was legally
impossible  for Guity to have committed the crime to which he
had pleaded guilty in the family court case relating to his
wife. . . . 
16 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
. . . . 
The ICA held correctly that Guity was entitled to
withdraw his guilty plea in the family court case because
"the Circuit Court definitively knew that it was legally
impossible  for Guity to have committed third-degree sexual
assault of his wife[.]" 
144 Hawai#i at 559, 562-63, 445 P.3d at 140, 143-44 (emphasis 
added). 
The State argues that the court decision reversing or 
vacating a conviction must contain the precise words, "actually 
innocent," because HRS § 661B-1(b)(1) requires that "the court decision so state[]." Were that the case, any court could subvert an actually innocent person's standing to make a claim for redress by simply omitting the words "actually innocent" from its decision. That result would be absurd. See Barker, 153 
Hawai#i at 149 n.8, 528 P.3d at 222 n.8 (noting that "if a 
literal construction of statutory language would produce an absurd result, we presume that result was not intended and construe the statute in accord with its underlying legislative intent" (cleaned up)). 
Neither Guity I nor Guity II contained the words 
"actually innocent." However, Guity I states there was no factual basis (because the complaining witness was Guity's wife) or legal basis (because the definition of "sexual contact" excluded contact with the defendant's spouse) for Guity's conviction. And Guity II noted it was legally impossible for Guity to have committed the offense to which he pleaded guilty in the Family Court Case. Given the undisputed facts in the Family 
17 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Court Case, that was the equivalent of stating that Guity was 
actually innocent of the crime for which he had been convicted — Sexual Assault in the Third Degree of his wife. Accordingly, we hold that Guity's petition met the pleading requirements of HRS § 661B-1(b)(1) with respect to the Family Court Case,
22 and that 
the Circuit Court erred by dismissing Guity's petition with respect to the Family Court Case.
23 
C. The Circuit Court did not err by dismissing
Guity's petition with respect to the CircuitCourt Case. 
In the Circuit Court Case, Guity pleaded guilty to 
Sexual Assault in the Second Degree, in violation of HRS § 707-
731(1)(a) (Supp. 2009). The trial court denied Guity's motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Guity had represented himself at the hearing on the motion. In Guity I we held that the trial court failed to obtain a valid waiver of Guity's right to counsel before the hearing. 2016 WL 6427681, at *8-9. We remanded to the trial court for further proceedings. Nothing in our memorandum opinion can reasonably be interpreted as stating that Guity was actually innocent of Sexual Assault in the Second Degree. 
In Guity II the supreme court noted that our "remand 
instructions require the [trial] court to rehear the motion to 
22 We express no opinion on whether, or how, HRS § 661B-3(b) should
be applied on remand, or whether Guity is entitled to redress under HRS
§ 661B-3(c). This opinion addresses only the propriety of the Circuit Court'sorder granting the State's motion to dismiss. 
23 Our holding is limited to the specific facts of this case. 
18 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
withdraw the plea, leaving the possibility open that the [trial] 
court could deny Guity's motion to withdraw the remaining plea." 144 
Hawai#i at 561, 445 P.3d at 142. The supreme court held that 
Guity's plea agreement "was clearly a global plea agreement[,]" id. at 562, 445 P.3d at 143, and "because Guity was entitled to withdraw his plea in the family court case, he was also entitled to withdraw his plea in the circuit court case[,]" id. at 563, 445 P.3d at 144. The supreme court remanded "with instructions to accept Guity's withdrawal of both pleas and for further proceedings consistent with this opinion." Id. at 563-64, 445 P.3d at 144-45. Nothing in the supreme court's opinion can reasonably be interpreted as stating that Guity was actually innocent of Sexual Assault in the Second Degree. 
On remand Guity moved to dismiss all six counts because 
of defects in the indictment. 
The trial court granted the motion 
because the indictment failed "to define or specify 'compulsion' as defined in HRS § 707-700[.]" The dismissal was "with prejudice, as the State can no longer prosecute the case due to lack of contact with the complainant." Nothing in the trial court's order can reasonably be interpreted as stating that Guity was actually innocent of Sexual Assault in the Second Degree — or any other counts of the indictment. We also note that HRS § 661B-1(b)(1) requires that "the court decision" that "reversed or vacated" the "judgment of conviction" state that the petitioner was "actually innocent of the crimes for which the petitioner was convicted[.]" The trial court's order dismissing 
19 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the indictment did not reverse or vacate Guity's judgment of 
conviction. It could not be relied on as the decision stating that Guity was actually innocent for purposes of HRS § 661B-1(b)(1). 
On this record, Guity's petition did not — and could 
not — satisfy the pleading requirements of HRS § 661B-1(b)(1) with respect to the Circuit Court Case. The Circuit Court did not err by dismissing Guity's petition with respect to the Circuit Court Case. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
For the reasons explained above, we vacate the Circuit 
Court's "Judgment" entered on December 15, 2021; and vacate in part the Circuit Court's "Order Granting Defendant State of 
Hawaii's  Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative, for Summary 
Judgment, Filed August 17, 2021[,]" entered on October 27, 2021, to the extent it dismissed Guity's petition with respect to his conviction in the Family Court Case, but affirm that order to the extent it dismissed Guity's petition with respect to his conviction in the Circuit Court Case. We remand to the Circuit Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
