APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST  CIRCUIT

SUMMARY DISPOSITION  ORDER  
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Wadsworth and Guidry, JJ.)  
On October 1, 2021, Petitioner -Appellant First 
Hawaiian Bank ( FHB) appealed from the (1) July 21, 2021 Order 
Granting in Part and Denying in Part [FHB's] Petition to Quash 
the Subpoena Duces Tecum dated February 24, 2021 (Subpoena 
Order); (2) August 6, 2021 Order Granting Hawaiian Host , Inc's 
(Hawaiian Host ) Ex Parte Motion to Require Compliance by 
August 11, 2021 [ with the Subpoena Order] (Compliance Order ); 
and (3) September 23, 2021 Order Denying [FHB's Motion for

Reconsideration of the August 11, 2021 Compliance Order] (Order 
Denying Reconsideration ), entered by the Circuit Court of the 
First Circuit (circuit court).1 
The Subpoena Order required FHB to produce certain 
documents to Respondent -Appellee Hawaiian Host, Inc. (Hawaiian 
Host) in response to a subpoena issued by an arbitrator in an 
arbitration proceeding between Hawaiian Host and Citadel 
Pacific, Ltd., Citadel Food Group Hawaii LLC and Citadel 
Windbreak, LLC (together, Citadel). FHB was not a party to the 
arbitration proceedings. The Compliance Order set a deadline of 
August 11, 2021 for FHB to produce the documents. 
FHB raises four points of error, contending the 
circuit court erred by: (1) failing to weigh the likely harm to 
FHB with the speculative benefit to Hawaiian Host; (2) 
misinterpreting the protections of Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) 
§ 412:2-104 (2004); (3) granting Hawaiian Host 's ex parte motion 
to require compliance; and (4) denying FHB's motion for 
reconsideration.2 
The assessment documents at issue have never been 
produced by FHB. Following the circuit court's issuance of the 
1 The Honorable John M. Tonaki presided. 
2 FHB also contends that the circuit court erred in failing to 
enter a final judgment. However, on March 16, 2022, this court ordered a 
temporary remand, and on May 13, 2022, the circuit court entered a final 
judgment.

Compliance Order , FHB posted a supersedeas bond and obtained a 
stay pending appeal. In January 2024, FHB informed this court 
that it reached a settlement with Hawaiian Host , and that "[a]s 
a result of the settlement between FHB and [Hawaiian Host], 
there is no active dispute between FHB and [Hawaiian Host] 
relating to the Regulatory Assessment Documents."3 FHB has 
requested that this court issue a decision on appeal, 
notwithstanding the settlement , contending that "although the 
settlement resolves the issue as between FHB and [Hawaiian Host] 
in this Appeal, FHB requests this Court to issue a decision 
because (1) the 'public interest' exception to the mootness 
doctrine applies, and (2) the 'capable of repetition, yet 
evading review' exception to the mootness doctrine also 
applies." FHB's contention lacks merit, as the exceptions to 
the mootness doctrine do not apply here. 
3   FHB moved to supplement the record of this appeal with, inter 
alia, the January 22, 2024 Stipulation for Partial Dismissal with Prejudice 
of Complaint a nd Counterclaims and Order (Stipulation ). See CAAP -21-0000534 
Dkt. 93.   FHB represented that the settlement "resolves the dispute between 
FHB and [Hawaiian Host], including the issues which are the subject of this 
Appeal." We denied FHB's motion to supplement, pursuant to Hawaiʻi Rules of 
Appellate Procedure Rule 10(e), but gave FHB leave to refile a motion for 
this court to take judicial notice of the Stipulation.  
Although FHB did not refile its motion, we exercise our discretion to 
take judicial notice of the Stipulation, which is part of the court record of 
a related circuit court proceeding, Case No. 1CCV -20-0001482. Kaho ʻohanohano 
v. State, 114 Hawaiʻi 302, 329 n.19, 162 P.3d 696, 723 n.19 (2007) ("[T]he 
general rule that an appellate court is limited to the records and facts in 
the lower court's proceedings, is subject to the right of an appellate court 
in a proper case to take judicial notice of new developments not considered 
by the lower court.") (cleaned up); Roxas v. Marcos, 89 Hawaiʻ i 91, 110 n.9, 
969 P.2d 1209, 1228 n.9 (1998) ("an appellate court may in its discretion, 
take judicial notice of files or records of a case on appeal") ( cleaned up).

Hawaiʻi courts recognize three exceptions to the 
mootness doctrine: (1) the capable of repetition, yet evading 
review exception; (2) the public interest exception, and (3) the 
collateral consequences exception. Wilmington Sav. Fund Soc'y 
FSB v. Domingo , 155 Hawaiʻi 1, 13, 556 P.3d 347, 359 (2024) , 
(quoting Hamilton ex rel Lethem v. Lethem , 119 Hawaiʻi 1, 5, 193 
P.3d 839, 843 (2008)). 
FHB does not contend that a failure to issue a 
decision in this appeal will have collateral consequences for 
FHB. Moreover, a lthough FHB has requested a decision on the 
merits of this appeal under the capable of repetition yet 
evading review and public interest exceptions, we conclude that 
those exceptions do not apply. FHB expressed concerns that the 
Subpoena Order would result in it being required to produce 
documents in violation of HRS § 412:2-104 (2004), which 
generally protects information produced by financial 
institutions to the State of Hawaiʻi, Division of Financial 
Institutions ( DFI). However, the Circuit Court's Subpoena Order 
excuses FHB from disclosing information prepared specifically 
for the purpose of reporting to the DFI. Nothing in the record 
suggests that attempts to subpoena records otherwise protected 
from disclosure by HRS § 412:2 -104 is likely to recur, such that 
it would be beneficial for the court to provide guidance at this

time.4 Nor is there anything in the record that suggests a party 
would be unable to obtain appellate review of the issue if it 
arises in a future case. 
For similar reasons, we conclude that the public 
interest exception does not apply. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is 
dismissed.
