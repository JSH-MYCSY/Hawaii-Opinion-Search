In these consolidated appeals, self -represented 
Defendant -Appellant Celeste M. Gonsalves ( Gonsalves ) appeals 
from the September 29, 2021 Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion 
for Summary Judgment Filed on September 7, 2021, in favor of 
self-represented Plaintiff -Appellee Stuart B. Glauberman 
(Glauberman ), by his Managing Agent , KFG Properties, Inc. ( KFG 
Properties ), and the October 4, 2021 Judgment for Possession in 
favor of Glauberman and Plaintiff -Appellee Vicky Ramil ( Ramil), 
entered by the District Court of the First Circuit Ko‘olaupoko 
Division ( District Court ),1 in Civil Nos. 1DRC -21-0002121 and 
1DRC-21-0001879 respectively. 
Glauberman and Ramil rented an accessory dwelling unit 
to Gonsalves, and self -managed the rental unit until December 
2020, when they hired KFG Properties as their property manager. 
On February 21, 2021, Glauberman and Ramil filed a Complaint 
(Assumpsit, Summary Possession/Landlord – Tenant Damages) 
against Gonsalves in Civil No. 1DRC -21-0001879, alleging 
Gonsalves caused electrical and plumbing damage to the premises, 
failed to properly dispose of garbage and refused their requests

for an inspection, and that they had given Gonsalves a 10-day 
non-monetary default notice on February 9, 2021. 
On March 3, 2021, Glauberman, through KFG Properties, 
filed a Complaint (Assumpsit, Summary Possession/Landlord – 
Tenant Damages) against Gonsalves in Civil No. 1DRC -21-0002121, 
alleging Gonsalves refused to vacate after a 45-day notice that 
the owners' son was moving in. 
Gonsalves filed counterclaims in both cases, alleging 
that Glauberman and Ramil were retaliating against her because 
she started withholding rent in October 2020, after complaining 
to them about the neighbor's yardman smoking while operating 
machinery to trim a hedge in close proximity to her rental unit. 
Gonsalves deemed that to be a fire hazard, and complained that 
the secondhand smoke from the neighbor's yardman smoking often 
came into her unit. Gonsalves stated that because Glauberman 
and Ramil did not resolve the issue, she reported it to her 
Section 8 Housing Assistance officer and withheld her portion of 
the rent. 
The district court heard Civil Nos. 1DRC -21-0001879 
and 1DRC -21-0002121 together for trial on the issue of 
possession. Gonsalves failed to appear twice in person for 
trial on the issue of possession, first on July 30, 2021, when 
she did not appear at all, and again on August 6, 2021, when she 
3   
 
  
 
      
  
 
 
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appeared by Zoom even though trial was scheduled to be in 
person. Both times Gonsalves submitted notes from her doctor, 
and requested continuances due to medical reasons. The first 
time Gonsalves failed to appear, the district court rescheduled 
the trial to August 6, 2021. When Gonsalves failed to appear in 
person again on August 6, 2021, the district court instructed 
Glauberman and Ramil to file motions for summary judgment, and 
the district court ultimately granted motions for summary 
judgment filed by them, leading Gonsalves to file these appeals. 
Gonsalves contends the district court committed the 
following errors in Civil No. 1DRC -21-0002121: (1) denying her 
July 8, 2021 non -hearing motion for continuance of the August 6, 
2021 trial; (2) instructing Glauberman, at the August 6, 2021 
hearing, to file a motion for summary judgment; (3) informing 
Glauberman, at an August 27, 2021 hearing, that the court would 
deny his motion for summary judgment but allowing him to 
withdraw the motion rather than ruling on the motion; (4) 
denying Gonsalves's motion for reconsideration or new trial on 
September 24, 2021 ; (5) granting Glauberman summary judgment on 
possession on September 24, 2021 ; and (6) engaging in ex parte 
communications with Glauberman 's counsel on September 10, 2021 , 
when she was not present in the courtroom .

Gonsalves contends the district court committed the 
following errors in Civil No. 1DRC -21-0001879: (1) denying her 
request for continuance made at the hearing on August 6, 2021; 
(2)instructing Glauberman and Ramil to file a motion for summary 
judgment at the August 6, 2021 hearing; (3) denying her request 
to continue the August 27, 2021 hearing on Glauberman and 
Ramil's motion for summary judgment; (4) granting Glauberman and 
Ramil's motion for summary judgment at t he August 27, 2021 
hearing; (5) basing t he August 27, 2021 grant of summary 
judgment on testimony given by Gonsalves in other cases; (6) 
notifying Glauberman and Ramil at the hearing held on 
September 10, 2021 that they attached the wrong copy of the 
rental agreement to their motion for summary judgment and had 
not given proper notice of their motion; (7) not bringing 
Gonsalves into the courtroom for the September 10, 2021 hearing; 
(8) granting Glauberm an and Ramil summary judgment on 
September 24, 2021; and (9) denying Gonsalves's motion to 
dismiss at the September 24, 2021 hearing. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we 
resolve Gonsalves's points of error as follows. 
5   
 
   We review the grant or denial of a continuance for an 
abuse of discretion. Sapp v. Wong, 62 Haw. 34, 41, 609 P.2d 
137, 142 (1980)  (citations omitted).   Generally, to constitute 
an abuse of discretion it must appear that the court clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles 
of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party 
litigant. Schmidt v. Bd. of Directors of Ass'n of Apartment 
Owners of Marco Polo Apartments, 73 Haw. 526, 533, 836 P.2d 479, 
483 (1992). 
  
   
 
 
 
 
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
We review the grant or denial of summary judgment de 
novo using the same standard applied by the district court. 
Nozawa v. Operating Engineers Loc . Union No. 3 , 142 Hawaiʻi 331, 
338, 418 P.3d 1187, 1194 (2018) (citation s omitted). Summary 
judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, answers 
to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the 
affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to 
any material fact and that the moving party is en titled to a 
judgment as a matter of law. Id. at 342, 418 P.3d at 1198. A 
fact is material if proof of that fact would have the effect of 
establishing or refuting one of the essential elements of a 
cause of action or defense asserted by the parties. Id. The 
evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non -
moving parties. Id. 
6   
 
   We review a ruling on a motion to dismiss de  novo.   
Young v. Allstate Ins. Co., 119 Hawai ʻi 403, 411, 198 P.3d 666, 
674 (2008).  
"A complaint should not be dismissed for failure to 
state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff 
can prove no set of facts in support of his or her claim that 
would entitle him or her to relief." Flores v. Logan, 151 Haw. 357, 366, 513 P.3d 423, 432 (2022) (citations omitted). 
 
  
 
 
  
 
   
  
 
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
We review the denial of a motion for new trial for 
abuse of discretion. Kato v. Funari , 118 Hawaiʻi 375, 381, 191 
P.3d 1052, 1058 (2008) (citation omitted). 
Gonsalves has not shown the district court abused its 
discretion in denying her requests for continuance of the 
August 6, 2021 hearing, and hearing the cases together. While 
we agree that the district court erred when it proceeded with 
the hearing and granted summary judgment on August 27, 2021, the 
error was harmless because the district court s ubsequently 
granted Gonsalves's motion to set aside the summary judgment .2 
The district court did not err when it granted summary 
judgment to Glauberman and Ramil on September 24, 2021 and 
The district court set aside its August 27, 2021 grant of summary 
judgment to Glauberman and Ramil because Glauberman and Ramil's motion for 
summary judgment was not filed and served at least ten days prior to the 
hearing, as required by District Court Rul es of Civil Procedure Rule 56(c), 
and Glauberman and Ramil attached an incomplete copy of their rental 
agreement with Gonsalves, which was missing the Section 8 Housing and Urban 
Development ( HUD) tenancy addendum.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
denied Gonsalves's September 2 2, 2021 motion to dismiss their 
complaint. Gonsalves alleged that Glauberman and Ramil were 
retaliating against her because she began withholding rent due 
to the neighbor's yardman smoking near her unit . Retaliatory 
eviction was not a valid defense for Gonsalves, however, because 
she admitted to withholding her portion of the rent starting in 
October 2020. Ryan v. Herzog , 142 Hawai‘i 278, 284, 418 P.3d 
619, 625 (2018) ("Once one of those three triggering [eviction 
under Hawa ii Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 521-74(a)] events occurs 
and the tenant continues to pay rent , the landlord is prohibited 
from retaliating by evicting the tenant, raising the rent, or 
decreasing services.") (emphasis added) (citing HRS § 521 -74(a) 
(2018) (a "good faith" complaint to a "governmental agency 
concerned with landlord -tenant disputes of conditions in or 
affecting the tenant's dwelling unit" is a defense to a summary 
possession action provided that "the tenant continues to tender 
the usual rent to the landlord.")). 
The Section 8 HUD tenancy addendum, which was part of 
Gonsalves's rental agreement, allows the landlord to terminate 
the tenancy for good cause, during the initial term of the 
lease, and to the extent permitted by state law thereafter. The 
record reflects that Gonsalves's tenancy was terminated after 
the initial term of the lease had ended. Gonsalves admitted

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that she had put a lock on the front water faucet, did not place 
her garbage in the trash bins, removed then glued back a light 
switch faceplate, and refused their request for an inspection, 
which were the reasons given by Glauberman and Ramil for issuing 
her a 10-day notice of termination of tenancy on February 9, 
2021. Gonsalves submitted a photograph of the glued light 
switch faceplate, taken on September 19, 2021 with her notation, 
"[f]aceplate can be changed in 48 hours by licensed 
electrician." Even assuming arguendo that those acts were not 
material breaches that would provide grounds for termination of 
the tenancy, HRS § 521-71(a) (2018) separately allows a month -to-
month tenancy to be terminated on a 45-day written notice. 
HRS § 521-71(1) (2018) ("When the tenancy is month -to-month, the 
landlord may terminate the rental agreement by notifying the 
tenant, in writing, at least forty -five days in advance of the 
anticipated termination."). That requirement was met. 
Gonsalves does not dispute that sh e received a 45-day notice of 
termination of tenancy, and the writ of possession and judgment 
for possession were issued by the district court after Hawai‘i's 
COVID-19 eviction moratorium had expired.3 
3 Hawai‘i's COVID-19 eviction moratorium went into effect on 
April 17, 2020, with the issuance of Governor David Ige's Fifth Supplementary 
Proclamation on COVID-19, and was extended through August 6, 2021 with 
(continued . . .)

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Finally, there is no dispute that the district court 
should not have conducted the September 10, 2021 hearing while 
Gonsalves was left outside in a waiting room. However, there 
was no prejudice to Gonsalves by the district court proceeding 
with the hearing, with Gonsalves being absent, as the district 
court granted her motions and set aside the judgment. We also 
find that the district court did not err by directing Glauberman 
and Ramil to file a motion for summary judgment during the 
earlier August 6, 2021 hearing, and that the district court did 
not improperly give legal advice to Glauberman and Ramil. In 
directing Glauberman and Ramil to file motions for summary 
judgment , the district court balanced Gonsalves's request that 
trial on possession be postponed with Glauberman and Ramil's 
interest in having an expeditious resolution of their claim to 
recover possession. 
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district 
court's September 29, 2021 Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for 
(. . . continued) 
Governor Ige's Twenty -First Supplementary Proclamation. Hawai ‘i Emergency
