APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 1CC151001045) 
ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Hiraoka and McCullen, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of the Motion to Dismiss Appeal 
(Motion to Dismiss), filed by Plaintiff-Appellee U.S. Bank 
National Association (Appellee) on December 1, 2021, the papers 
in support, and the record, it appears that this court lacks 
jurisdiction over the appeal by self-represented Defendants-Appellants Arthur Emil Galang, Norivic V. Galang, and Norma Pascual Rodil (Rodil) (collectively, Appellants) from Civil 
No. 1CC151001045.   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Circuit Court of the First Circuit's (circuit 
court) February 22, 2020 "Judgment on Findings of Fact, 
Conclusions of Law and Order Granting [Appellee]'s Motion for 
Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure Against All [Appellants] on Complaint Filed May 29, 2015 [(Order Granting
MSJ)]" (Judgment) is final and appealable. See Jenkins v. Cades 
Schutte Fleming & Wright
, 76 Hawai# i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 
1338 (1994); 
Ditto v. McCurdy
, 103 Hawai# i 153, 157, 80 P.3d 974, 
978 (2003); 
Ueoka v Szymanski
, 107 Hawai# i 386, 396, 114 P.3d 
892, 902 (2005). However, Appellants failed to file their 
October 6, 2021 notice of appeal within thirty days after entry of the Judgment, as required by Hawai# i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 4(a)(1). Therefore, we lack jurisdiction 
over the appeal from the Judgment. 
See Grattafiori v. State
, 79 
Hawai# i 10, 13, 897 P.2d 937, 940 (1995).1 
To the extent Appellants appeal from the circuit 
court's February 22, 2020 Order Granting MSJ, the Order Granting 
MSJ is not independently appealable under the Forgay doctrine, the collateral-order doctrine, or Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 
§ 641-1(b) (2016). See Greer v. Baker
, 137 Hawai# i 249, 253, 369 
P.3d 832, 836 (2016); HRS § 641-1(b). Further, again, the 
October 6, 2021 notice of appeal would be untimely even if such order could be appealed. 
To the extent Appellants appeal from a proposed order 
or judgment, these are not final and, therefore, not appealable. See
 HRS § 641-1(a) (2016). 
Moreover, the appealed September 13, 2021 Amended 
Certificate of Service for the Order Granting MSJ is not appealable because it is not a final judgment, order, or decree. See HRS § 641-1(a). 
The appealed January 8, 2020 oral order striking 
Appellants' opposition to Appellee's motion for summary judgment is not appealable because it is not written. See KNG Corp. v. 
1 Appellant Arthur Emil Galang previously appealed from the Judgment
in CAAP-20-0000176, but that appeal was dismissed because he failed to file an
opening brief. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Kim, 107 Hawai# i 73, 77, 110 P.3d 397, 401 (2005); HRAP 
Rule 4(a)(1). 
And the "Order Denying Motion to Set Aside Default and 
to Appoint Counsel" is not independently appealable under the 
Forgay
 doctrine, the collateral-order doctrine, or HRS § 641-
1(b). See Greer
, 137 Hawai# i at 253, 369 P.3d at 836; HRS § 641
-
1(b). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion to 
Dismiss is granted, and this appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are 
dismissed.

Honolulu, Hawai# i, February 11, 2022.
