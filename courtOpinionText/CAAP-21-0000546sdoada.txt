EB, Defendant-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1PP191000107) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By:  Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and Chan, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant MI (Mother
) appeals from the "Order 
Following Trial" entered by the Family Court of the First Circuit 
on September 10, 2021.1  For the reasons explained below, we 
affirm. 
Mother gave birth to RI (Child) in 2016.  Child's 
certificate of live birth did not identify a father.  On March 22, 2019, Plaintiff-Appellee Child Support Enforcement Agency (CSEA) filed a "Complaint for Establishment of Paternity" 
against Mother and Defendant-Appellee EB (Father).  On May 17, 
2019, genetic test results were filed showing a 99.99% 
probability that Father is Child's biological father. 
1 The Honorable Courtney N. Naso presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Father acknowledged paternity.  A "Judgment of 
Paternity" establishing Father as Child's natural father was 
entered on September 12, 2019.  Mother was awarded physical custody of Child.  Father was ordered to pay child support of $600 per month beginning September 2019.  A number of issues, including past child support, were reserved for future determination. 
Trial took place over five days during December 2020 
and January 2021.  The Order Following Trial was entered on September 10, 2021.  Relevant to this appeal, the family court ruled: 
Child Support.  The Court calculated the past and current
child support per the Child Support Guidelines Worksheet("CSGW"), based on Father's testimony that his income is$36,000/year and Mother's Paternity Financial InformationSheet and testimony that she has had no employment sinceApril, 2020. . . . 
(A) Arrears (May 17, 2019 — March 31, 2020).  The 
Court finds that Father owes child support arrears beginningMay 17, 2019 (i.e., the date the paternity test found fatherto be natural father)[,] and does not owe any child supportfrom the date of the child's birth [date redacted] throughMay 16, 2019. . . .  Father shall pay to Mother childsupport arrears in the sum of $600.00 per month for theperiod of May 17, 2019[,] thru March 31, 2020 . . . . 
(B) Current (commencing April 1, 2020).  Based on 
the above, Father shall pay Mother as and for the supportand maintenance of the minor child the sum of $600.00 permonth commencing April 1, 2020. . . .  All of the foregoingshall be subject to further order of the Court. 
Mother filed a timely notice of appeal.  She argues 
that the family court erred by: (1) failing to order that Father 
pay child support from the date of Child's birth until the date 
the genetic testing results were filed; and (2) improperly 
calculating the amount of child support owed by Father after the 
date the genetic testing results were filed. 
The family court entered findings of fact and 
conclusions of law on December 13, 2021.  Findings of fact are reviewed under the "clearly erroneous" standard.  Fisher v. Fisher, 111 Hawai# i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 (2006).  A finding 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of fact is clearly erroneous when the record lacks substantial 
evidence to support the finding.  Id. Conclusions of law are 
reviewed de novo, under the right/wrong standard.  Id. A 
conclusion of law that is supported by the trial court's findingsof fact and reflects an application of the correct rule of law  
will not be overturned.  Est. of Klink ex rel. Klink v. State, 113 Hawai# i 332, 351, 152 P.3d 504, 523 (2007).
(1) Mother challenges the family court's conclusion of 
law (COL) no. 13: 
13. Pursuant to HRS § 584-15(c) and (d), and based
on the credible testimony by the parties at trial,
specifically the testimony about Mother's mixedcommunications with Father about his paternity of minorchild, Mother's expressed desire that she was uninterestedin communicating with Father, and the fact that Mother didnot file a paternity action sooner, the Court deems it justand appropriate that zero child support arrears are orderedfrom Father to Mother retroactive to the Child's date of birth . . . , but arrears would be just and appropriateeffective May 17, 2019, the date the genetic test resultsfor Father were filed, reflecting Father's probability ofpaternity being 99.99%. 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 584-15 (2018) provides, 
in relevant part: 
(c) The [paternity] judgment or order may contain
any other provision directed against the appropriate partyto the proceeding, concerning the duty of support . . . . The court may further order the noncustodial parent to
reimburse the custodial parent . . . for reasonable expensesincurred prior to entry of judgment, including support . . .for the benefit of the child. 
(d) Support judgment or orders ordinarily shall be
for periodic payments which may vary in amount. . . . Thecourt may limit the father's liability for past support of
the child to the proportion of the expenses already incurredthat the court deems just. 
(Emphasis added.)  We review the family court's application of 
HRS § 584-15(c) and (d) for abuse of discretion.  See State, Child Support Enf't Agency v. Doe, 98 Hawai# i 58, 64-65, 41 P.3d 
720, 726-27 (App. 2001). 
COL no. 13 was supported by the family court's findings
of fact (
FOF):  
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
17. [Father] is found by the Court to be a credible 
witness. 
18. . . .  Mother's testimony lacked credibility, in
part, and her testimony regarding (a) her communications
with Father about the parentage of the Child and (b) herwillingness to include Father in Child's life isspecifically not credible. 
. . . . 
20. Mother and Father were no longer in a dating or
romantic relationship during Mother's pregnancy, but were incontact with each other. 
21. The Court found both parties to be credible in
their accounts of the strained relationship and strainedcommunications between Mother and Father. 
22. While pregnant and after the birth of minor
child, Mother told Father numerous times that he was not thebiological father of minor child.  The Court found Father's testimony to be credible regarding this matter. 
23. Following the birth of minor child, Mother told
Father to stay away from her, alleging abuse by Father andthreatening to petition for a protective order against him. The Court found Father's testimony to be credible regardingthis matter. 
24. Mother did not name Father on the birth 
certificate. 
25. After the birth of minor child, Father asked to
participate in a paternity test, but Mother refused.  The Court found Father's testimony to be credible regarding thismatter. 
26. Neither party petitioned for paternity until
CSEA initiated this case. 
27. Mother never sought or received any financial
assistance from the State of Hawaii, Department of HumanServices or other State agencies in regards to the care andmaintenance of the Child, nor did Mother request childsupport from Father until CSEA became involved. 
28. Both parties were aware of the court process for
petitioning for paternity and child support. 
These findings are supported by substantial evidence in the 
record and are not clearly erroneous.  Mother cites contrary evidence including her own testimony, and argues that she was more credible than Father.  However, evaluating the credibilityof witnesses and weighing conflicting evidence lies in the sole  
province of the trial court.  
See Fisher
, 111 Hawai# i at 46, 137 
P.3d at 360 ("It is well-settled that an appellate court will not 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
pass upon issues dependent upon the credibility of witnesses and 
the weight of evidence; this is the province of the trier of fact.") (citation omitted). 
COL no. 13 is not wrong; it is supported by the family 
court's findings of fact, which are not clearly erroneous, and reflects an application of the correct rule of law.  See Est. of Klink
, 113 Hawai# i at 351, 152 P.3d at 523.  We conclude that the 
family court did not abuse its discretion by not awarding Mother child support from Child's date of birth until the date Father's genetic test results were filed.
(2) Mother challenges the family court's COL no. 9: 
9. Pursuant to HRS § 576D-7, the Court finds that
based on the parties' incomes, child support payments owing
from Father to Mother would otherwise be set at $552 permonth per the 
Hawai #i Child Support Guidelines, but Father
agreed to pay $600 per month.  Therefore, exceptionalcircumstances exist to order an upward deviation to $600 permonth.  Father is credited for any previous child supportpayments made. 
HRS § 576D-7 (2018) requires that the family court 
"establish guidelines to establish the amount of child 
support[.]"  The family court must use the Hawai# i Child Support 
Guidelines established under HRS § 576D-7 to establish the amount 
of child support required to be paid by a parent, except when 
exceptional circumstances warrant departure.  HRS § 571-52.5 (2018); 
PO v. JS
, 139 Hawai# i 434, 442, 393 P.3d 986, 994 (2017). 
COL no. 9 was supported by the family court's findings 
of fact: 
29. Father has been self-employed since at least
2018 doing business as EKB Construction. 
30. In tax year 2020, Father earned thirty-six
thousand dollars ($36,000). 
31. In tax year 2019, Father earned fifty-seven
thousand six hundred dollars ($57,600). 
32. In tax year 2018, Father earned approximately
thirty-six thousand dollars ($36,000). 
. . . . 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
37. The Court utilized the Child Support Guidelines
Worksheet ("CSGW") to calculate the parties' child support
obligation based on their respective monthly gross incomes[$36,000 per year or $3,000 per month for Father; $0 forMother]. 
. . . . 
40. The resulting child support obligation reflected
Father being obligated to pay Mother child support in theamount of $552.00 per month. 
41. Father was willing and agreed to pay $600 per
month to Mother as and for child support. 
These findings are supported by substantial evidence in the 
record and are not clearly erroneous.  The Guidelines worksheet filed by the family court reflects data consistent with the court's findings. 
Mother argues that the family court "failed to utilize 
verified gross annual income for Father when calculating Father's child support . . . .  Instead, the Court relied on untrustworthy and unsupported figures for Father's self-employed annual gross income when calculating child support[.]"  But Mother fails to cite evidence in the record of Father's "verified gross annual income" upon which she claims the family court should have relied.  We are not obligated to search the record for information that should have been provided by Mother.  Haw. Ventures, LLC v. Otaka, Inc.

Hawai# i 296, 309 n.31, 97 P.3d 372, 385 n.31 (2004) (explaining

Miyamoto v. Lum
, 104 
Hawai# i 1, 11 n.14, 84 P.3d 509, 519 n.14 (2004)).  Mother's 
argument was not properly presented to the family court or preserved for appeal. 
We also note that the family court did not err by 
ordering support greater than required by the Guidelines.  On cross-examination Father agreed that he was paying $600 per month 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
in child support and was not contesting that amount.  In closing 
Mother argued: 
In terms of child support, Your Honor, we ask that the 
child support be maintained at $600 a month .  There has been 
no request by either party that that be modified[.]
