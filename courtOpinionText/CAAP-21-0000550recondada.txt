affirmed the circuit court's September 22, 2021 
(1) Writ of Possession and (2) "Order Denying 
Non-Hearing Motion to Vacate Judgment from 
September 1, 2021 Hearing"; 
(2) On February 21, 2025, Kaiama moved for 
reconsideration of this court's January 31, 2025

(3) Motion(s) for Reconsideration of the January 31, 2025 Summary Disposition Order were due on or 
before February 10, 2025. See Hawai‘ i Rules of
