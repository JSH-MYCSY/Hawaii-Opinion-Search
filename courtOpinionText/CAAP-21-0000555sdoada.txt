v. 
COLE F. SULENTA, Defendant-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 2CPC-20-0000220(3)) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: 
Leonard, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Nakasone, JJ.) 
Plaintiff-Appellant, State of Hawai# i (State) appeals 
from the September 13, 2021 Findings of Fact (FOF
), Conclusions 
of Law (COL); Order Granting Defendant-Appellee Cole F. Sulenta's 
(Sulenta) Motion to Dismiss Counts 1-5 for Insufficient Evidence 
(Order Granting Motion to Dismiss), filed by the Circuit Court of 
the Second Circuit (Circuit Court).1 Sulenta was charged via 
Felony Information and Non-Felony Complaint (Information) with Accidents Involving Death or Serious Bodily Injury in violation 
of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291C-12; two counts of 
Negligent Injury in the First Degree in violation of HRS § 707-
705; Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant in violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1); and Reckless Driving of Vehicle in violation of HRS § 291-2.

    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
On appeal, the State contends that the Circuit Court 
erred in granting Sulenta's Motion to Dismiss Counts 1-5 for 
Insufficient Evidence (Motion to Dismiss) and entering FOF 9 and 
COLs 3, 4,2 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11.3 
2 The Circuit Court's FOF, COL, and Order Granting Motion to Dismiss
contains a typographical error with two COLs numbered as COL 4. In its 
Opening Brief, the State clarifies that it challenges the second COL 4 ( Second 
COL 4 ). 
3 The challenged FOF and COLS state: 
FINDINGS OF FACT 
. . . . 
9. The Order Granting Motion to Suppress further concluded
that Officer Thompson's Declaration is inadmissibletestimonial hearsay barred by 
Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.
S. 36 (2004). 
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 
. . . . 
3. The State's additional evidence was set forth in Ofc. 
Thompson's declaration was submitted in support of theinformation charging packet. However, this Court hasdetermined that information to be inadmissible testimonial hearsay, barred by 
Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36
(2004). 
. . . . 4. The information in the charging packet is admissible for
purposes of establishing probable cause to support theinformation charge. But, it is not permissible for purposes
of opposing the subsequent motion to dismiss for lack ofprobable cause nor for use at the trial where the proponent
of the hearsay statements is deceased and unavailable forcross-examination. 
5. When [Sulenta] exercised his right to seek dismissal of
the information pursuant to HRS § 806-86(a), he was stymiedin that effort because Ofc. Thompson was not here to answerquestions about his declaration. 
6. None of the facts argued by the State in opposition to
the instant motion to dismiss have any basis for admissionand consideration by this Court without Ofc. Thompson. 
7. The sources and identities of the declarant's hearsay
statements as related by Ofc [sic] Thompson in hisdeclaration are unknown to this Court. The declaration onlycited to two MPD reports, 19-035605 and 19-035607. But, theyare his own police reports, and his two police reports do

Upon review of the record and the briefs submitted by 
the parties and having given due consideration to the arguments 
advanced and the issues raised, we resolve the State's point of error as follows, and affirm. 
The pertinent background is as follows. On April 30, 
2020, the State filed the five-count Information against Sulenta, along with sealed exhibits in support of the Information (Sealed 
Exhibits
), which contained the Declaration of Maui Police 
Department (MPD) Officer Jason Thompson (Officer Thompson), who investigated the case involving Sulenta. FOFs 2 and 3. On May 
1, 2020, the Circuit Court found that the Sealed Exhibits contained sufficient evidence to support a finding of probable cause (PC) for the Information, and filed its Order Following 
Judicial Review of Information and Complaint and Supporting 
Documents (May 1, 2020 Order Finding PC).  FOF 4. 
4
not reference the additional evidence for which the State 
argued. 
8. Ofc. Thompson was not involved in investigating the
vehicle collision other than investigating [Sulenta] himselffor criminal conduct. Ofc. Thompson's records and files donot indicate that he conferred with other officers who did the collision investigation or what information was obtainedfrom such conferences. The only documented conference in hisreports was with Sergeant Ryan Saribay ("Sgt. Saribay"),which was irrelevant to this issue of the additional information. 
9.
 None of the other records and files in this case,
including prior motions and exhibits attached thereto, and
the items listed in the foregoing paragraph 9 of theFindings of Fact, indicate that Ofc. Thompson conferred withother officers who investigated the incident or whatinformation was obtained from such conferences, with theexception of a conference with Sgt. Saribay. 
10. Accordingly, the current records and files of this case
are devoid of any evidence to support a finding of probablecause for the continued prosecution of this case. 
11. The trial court can dismiss a complaint or indictment
because of the incompetency of evidence. State v. Corpuz, 67Haw. 438, 690 P.2d 282 (1984). Id., 67 Haw. at 440, 690 P.2dat 284. 
4 The Honorable Kirstin M. Hamman signed the May 1, 2020 Order
Finding PC. An amended order was filed on May 11, 2020. 
3     NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
On August 5, 2020, Officer Thompson died. FOF 5. 
In November 2020, Sulenta filed motions to suppress 
statements and evidence (Motions to Suppress). In his Motions to 
Suppress, Sulenta argued that the State's evidence, which 
included documentation created by Officer Thompson, such as evidence of oral statements made by Sulenta, Sulenta's Standardized Field Sobriety Test, the Incident/Investigation Report, the Motor Vehicle Accident Report, the transcript of Officer Thompson's body camera (body cam) video, and the Lahaina 
Police Station Processing Video (processing video), should be 
suppressed because Officer Thompson was now deceased and 
unavailable for cross-examination. Following a June 16, 2021 hearing
5 on the suppression motions, the Circuit Court granted 
the motions, and subsequently filed a July 23, 2021 FOF and COL; Order Granting Motion to Suppress Evidence (July 23, 2021 Order
Granting Suppression).
6 
5 The State called the following witnesses at the hearing: Shayna
Hipolito, a former MPD employee who assisted Officer Thompson with booking
Sulenta at the Lahaina Police Station and authenticated the processing video;MPD Officer Paul Pomainville, who authenticated Officer Thompson's body camvideo; and Sergeant Ryan Saribay, who responded to the police dispatch and wasthe first officer on the scene of the accident, observed Sulenta at the scene,and turned over the investigation once Officer Thompson arrived. 
6 The Order Granting Suppression stated in pertinent part: 
FINDINGS OF FACT 
10. Ofc. Thompson also prepared a declaration (Dkt.
#3) which served as the sole basis for the judicialdetermination of probable cause (Dkt. #7) for the FelonyInformation and Non-Felony Complaint herein (Dkt.#1). 
. . . . 
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 
. . . . 
19.
 Ofc. Thompson's declaration in support of the
Felony Information and Non-Felony Complaint herein, referredto in paragraph 4 above fall within the "core class oftestimonial statements described in Crawford." State v. Fitzwater, 122 Haw. 354, 371-373 (2010), quoting, Crawfordv. Washington, 541 U.S. at 51-52; Melendez v. Massachusetts,557 U.S. 305, 129 S. Ct. 2527 (2009). The declaration isinadmissible testimonial hearsay. 
4     NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
The Circuit Court suppressed the documentation from Officer 
Thompson, the body cam video, and the Lahaina Police Station Processing Video, ruling these items inadmissible at trial due to the Confrontation Clause and Sixth Amendment
7 issues resulting 
from Officer Thompson's unavailability for cross-examination by Sulenta. 
On July 29, 2021, Sulenta filed the Motion to Dismiss 
at issue in this appeal, arguing inter alia, that dismissal was necessary based on the July 23, 2021 Order Granting Suppression. Sulenta attached the suppression order to his motion, urging that "in light of [the order], it is evident that the State lacks the evidence to proceed against [Sulenta] . . . ." In opposition, the State argued that under HRS § 806-88(b), a determination of probable cause may be based in whole or in part on hearsay evidence and upon evidence that may ultimately be ruled inadmissible at trial, and that there was sufficient additional evidence that was not suppressed "for the case to proceed to trial." 
Following hearings on August 5 and 19, 2021, the 
Circuit Court granted Sulenta's motion and dismissed Counts 1-5 without prejudice, noting in its oral ruling that the State could re-file a felony information with the additional "potential sources of evidence that may exist" that the State had made reference to. On September 13, 2021, the Circuit Court filed its FOF, COL, and Order Granting Motion to Dismiss, from which the State timely appealed. 
A circuit court's ruling on a "motion to dismiss an 
[information] based on sufficiency of the evidence to support the [information]" is reviewed de novo. State v. Shaw, 150 Hawai# i 
56, 61, 497 P.3d 71, 76 (2021) (citing State v. Taylor, 126 Hawai# i 205, 215, 269 P.3d 740, 750 (2011)). 
7 The sixth amendment to the United States Constitution and article 
I, section 14 of the Hawai #i Constitution guarantee an accused the right to
confront adverse witnesses. State v. Balisbisana, 83 Hawai #i 109, 115, 924
P.2d 1215, 1221 (1996). 
5     NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
Findings of fact are reviewed on appeal under the
clearly erroneous standard. Jones v. State, 79 Hawai #i 330,
334, 902 P.2d 965, 969 (1995). "A finding of fact is clearly
erroneous when, despite evidence to support the finding, theappellate court is left with the definite and firmconviction in reviewing the entire evidence that a mistakehas been committed." Id. (quoting Tachibana v. State, 79Hawai #i 226, 231, 900 P.2d 1293, 1298 (1995)). "A finding of
fact is also clearly erroneous when the record lackssubstantial evidence to support the finding." O'Grady v.State, 140 Hawai #i 36, 43, 398 P.3d 625, 632 (2017) (quoting
In re Grievance Arbitration Between State of Haw. Org. ofPolice Officers, 135 Hawai #i 456, 461-62, 353 P.3d 998,
1003-04 (2015)). 
"An appellate court may freely review conclusions of
law and the applicable standard of review is the right/wrongtest." Dan v. State, 76 Hawai #i 423, 428, 879 P.2d 528, 533
(1994) (quoting Maria v. Freitas, 73 Haw. 266, 270, 832 P.2d259, 262 (1992)). 
Birano v. State, 143 Hawai# i 163, 181, 426 P.3d 387, 405 (2018). 
FOF 9 
FOF 9 stated that the suppression order concluded that 
Officer Thompson's Declaration was inadmissible hearsay banned by 
the Crawford case. The State acknowledges that FOF 9 "is a correct statement of what the Circuit Court ruled" in the suppression order, but claims that FOF 9 "incorrectly implies that the admissibility of evidence is a proper consideration on a Motion to Dismiss an Information." The State thus concedes that FOF 9 is accurate and not clearly erroneous as a factual finding. The State's disagreement with an implication of FOF 9 that it perceives as incorrect does not render FOF 9 clearly erroneous as a factual finding. See Birano, 143 Hawai# i at 181, 426 P.3d at 
405. 
COL 3 
The State argues that COL 3 is erroneous because the 
admissibility of evidence is not "a proper consideration" on a 
motion to dismiss an Information and that "while Crawford has implications regarding admission at trial, it has no bearing on the determination of probable cause." We do not read COL 3 as applying Crawford to a "determination of probable cause." COL 3, 
6     NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
which is actually an FOF, merely states that the evidence in 
Thompson's Declaration in support of the Information was previously determined by the court "to be inadmissible testimonial hearsay" banned by Crawford. This FOF is based on the record of prior proceedings in this case, is supported by the suppression order, and is not clearly erroneous. See id.
Second COL 4 and COLs 5 - 10 
The State argues that Second COL 4 was wrong, where the 
Circuit Court concluded that the "information in the charging 
packet," i.e. Officer Thompson's Declaration, "is not permissible for purposes of opposing the subsequent motion to dismiss for lack of probable cause nor for use at the trial where the proponent of the hearsay statements is deceased and unavailable for cross-examination." The State argues that HRS §§ 806-85(b)
 
and 806-88(b)  allow the court to rely upon hearsay for both the 98
8 HRS § 806-85 (2014), entitled "Probable cause," provides in
pertinent part: 
(a) When an information is filed, the court having
jurisdiction shall review the information and its exhibit todetermine whether there is probable cause to believe thatthe offense charged was committed and that the defendantcommitted the offense charged. 
(b) A finding of the existence of probable cause or lack
thereof may be based in whole or in part upon hearsayevidence or upon evidence that may ultimately be ruled to beinadmissible at the trial. 
(c) If the court finds that there is probable cause to
believe that the offense charged was committed and that thedefendant committed the offense charged, the court shall setbail and direct the clerk to issue a warrant for the arrest of the defendant. . . . 
9 HRS § 806-88 (2014), entitled "Ruling on motion to dismiss,"
provides: 
(a) The court shall determine from an examination of theinformation and its attachments, and in light of anyevidence presented at a hearing on a motion to dismiss theinformation, whether the information and its attachmentsestablish the existence of probable cause to believe thatthe offense charged has been committed and that thedefendant committed the offense charged. 
(continued...) 
7 9(...continued)    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
probable cause determination and a motion to dismiss an 
Information. The State also claims that Second COL 4 conflicts with HRS § 806-88, which "requires consideration" of Officer Thompson's Declaration submitted in support of the Information. 
While the wording in Second COL 4 is confusing, COL 7 
makes clear that the Circuit Court did consider Officer Thompson's Declaration. The Circuit Court's reasoning in Second COL 4 and COL 5 turned on Sulenta's inability to exercise his right to call the officer and question him at the motion to dismiss hearing as provided by HRS § 806-87(a).
10 HRS § 806-
87(a) provides that a defendant may introduce evidence at a hearing to dismiss an Information, by issuing subpoenas and calling witnesses, to challenge the existence of probable cause. Sulenta was unable to do this since Officer Thompson had passed away. Hence, COL 5's conclusion that Sulenta was "stymied" in seeking dismissal of the Information under HRS § 806-88(a), "because Officer Thompson was not here to answer questions about his declaration," was not wrong. See id. As the State points 
out, HRS § 806-88 requires the court to rule on a motion to dismiss based on reviewing the Information and attachments, but 
(b) A finding of the existence of probable cause or lack
thereof may be based in whole or in part upon hearsayevidence or on evidence that may ultimately be ruled to beinadmissible at the trial. 
10 HRS § 806-87 (2014), entitled "Evidence at hearing on motion to
dismiss," provides: 
(a) The defendant may introduce evidence at the hearing.The defendant may also subpoena and call witnesses if themotion is accompanied by a declaration stating that counselfor the defendant (or the defendant if appearing withoutcounsel) has a good faith basis to believe that each witnesssubpoenaed will provide specific testimony to helpdemonstrate that the information and its exhibit or exhibits do not establish the existence of probable cause to believethat the offense charged has been committed or probablecause to believe that the defendant committed the offense charged. 
(b) The court may, in its discretion, permit the State to
call witnesses, introduce evidence, or otherwise supplementthe exhibit or exhibits appended to the information. 
(Emphases added). 
8     NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
the statute also requires consideration of "any evidence 
presented at a hearing" on a motion to dismiss. Here, the Circuit Court in COL 7 did consider the contents of Officer Thompson's Declaration pursuant to HRS § 806-88(a), but further concluded that the Declaration and the other "facts argued by the State" could not be used to oppose the Motion to Dismiss where the officer "is deceased and unavailable for cross-examination." Second COL 4, COL 6. Second COL 4 and COL 6 were not wrong under the circumstances of this case, where Sulenta could not call or question Officer Thompson as a witness at the Motion to Dismiss hearing as provided by HRS § 806-87. See id. 
As to COLs 7-10, the State argues that these COLs are 
again "flawed" because they "ignore the basis [sic] principle regarding what may be considered on a Motion to Dismiss an Information" under HRS §§ 806-85(b) and 806-88(b). COLs 7-10 do not disregard HRS §§ 806-85(b) and 806-88(b), but reflect the Circuit Court's consideration of the entirety of the record before it, consistent with the hearing procedure set forth in HRS § 806-87. At a motion to dismiss hearing, HRS § 806-87 permits both sides the opportunity to present additional evidence beyond the original evidence in support of the initial probable cause determination. Here, the Circuit Court properly considered evidence beyond Officer Thompson's Declaration attached to the Information, pursuant to HRS §§ 806-87 and 806-88. Following a motion to dismiss hearing conducted in accordance with HRS §§ 806-85, 806-86, 806-87, and 806-88, COLs 7-10 set forth the Circuit Court's description and analysis of, and conclusions about the record of evidence presented. These COLs are not erroneous. See id. 
COL 11 
The State argues that the Circuit Court erred in COL 
11, which cites State v. Corpuz, 67 Haw. 438, 690 P.2d 282 
(1984), for the "proposition that a [] 'trial court can dismiss a Complaint or Indictment because of the incompetency of evidence.'" The State argues that this conclusion "ignores the 
9     NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
actual holding of Corpuz, which explicitly permits reliance upon 
hearsay testimony to support an Indictment." The State also argues that COL 11 is incorrect because "it specifically references dismissal of Complaints and Indictments" and not a Felony Information. These arguments lack merit. 
In Corpuz, the supreme court reaffirmed prior precedent 
that: "'where the hearsay testimony was not used deliberately in the place of better evidence to improve the case for an indictment, dismissal of the indictment is not required.'" Corpuz, 67 Haw. at 440, 690 P.2d at 285 (quoting State v. Murphy, 59 Haw. 1, 6, 575 P.2d 448, 453 (1978)). COL 11 refers to the standard of review used in the Corpuz case, and is not an erroneous statement of law. See id. at 440, 690 P.2d at 284 ("A 
motion to dismiss an indictment because of the incompetency of evidence before a grand jury is addressed to the discretion of the trial court."). 
The State's second argument that Corpuz applies only to 
complaints or indictments and not to an Information also lacks merit. Legal precedent and authorities pertaining to complaints and indictments similarly apply to a felony information. See HRS 
§ 806-9;
11 see also State v. Pitolo, 141 Hawai# i 131, 138 n.12, 
406 P.3d 354, 361 n.12 (App. 2017) (quoting HRS § 806-9 and recognizing that the requirement that an indictment contain an averment of facts regarding a statute of limitations also applies to a felony information). 
We thus conclude that the Circuit Court did not err in 
granting the motion to dismiss the Information without prejudice. See Shaw, 150 Hawai# i at 61, 497 P.3d at 76. 
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the September 13, 
2021 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law; Order Granting Defendant-Appellee Cole F. Sulenta's Motion to Dismiss Counts 1-5 
11 HRS § 806-9 (2014), entitled "Information, laws applicable,"
states in pertinent part: 
All provisions of law applying to prosecutions upon
indictments, . . . to motions, pleadings, trials, . . . andto all proceedings in cases of indictment, whether in thecourt of original or appellate jurisdiction, shall in thesame manner and to the same extent as near as may be, applyto information and all prosecutions and proceedings thereon.
