STATE OF HAWAIʻ I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v. 
ALIKA K. AMASIU, Defendant-Appellant. 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 2FFC-17-0000458) 
 
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: 
Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Alika K. Amasiu
, appeals from the 
Family Court of the Second Circuit's1 August 19, 2021 "Findings 
of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order" denying his "Motion to 
Dismiss for Violation of Statute of Limitations" (Order Denying Motion to Dismiss).

On appeal, Amasiu challenges the family court's 
determination that the statute of limitations did not require 
dismissal of the Second Felony Information.  2
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve this 
appeal as discussed below, and affirm. 
For a brief background, Amasiu's four-month-old Son 
suffered multiple injuries - "a left frontal skull fracture, a 
bi-lateral occipital skull fracture, a subdural hematoma, and a 
posterior right rib fracture." According to Maui Police 
Department Detective Mary-Lee Sagawinit, a doctor who treated Son at Maui Memorial Medical Center stated that Son was reported 
to have fallen off the bed after Amasiu saw a centipede on Son's 
head and hit the centipede. Due to the severity of his 
injuries, Son was transported to O‘ ahu. 
On November 28, 2014, Rupert Chang, M.D. (Dr. Chang) 
of Kapi‘ olani Medical Center noted Son suffered "skull and rib 
fractures," "an altered level of consciousness," and "brain 
swelling with an elevation of pressures in his head." Dr. Chang 
also noted that Son "required support on a breathing machine," 
2 Amasiu also challenges findings of fact numbers 1, 2, and 4, and 
conclusions of law numbers 4- 10.  However, the challenged findings were not 
clearly erroneous and the challenged conclusions were not wrong.

and "was at risk of life-long mental impairment from his brain 
injury." 
On November 22, 2017, the State charged Amasiu by 
information (First Felony Information) for Assault in the First Degree in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit. The First 
Felony Information was filed approximately five days before the 
three-year statute of limitations for the prosecution of a class 
B felony (which includes First Degree Assault) would have run. 
See generally
 Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 701
-
108(2)(d)(2014); 707-710(2) (2014). 
That same day, the circuit court, the Honorable 
Blaine J. Kobayashi presiding, determined there was "sufficient 
evidence to support a finding of probable cause for the 
Information and Complaint[.]"3 The circuit court issued a 
warrant of arrest for Amasiu with bail set at $50,000.00. 
About a month later, on December 21, 2017, the State 
filed the Second Felony Information in family court charging 
Amasiu with the same offense as the First Felony Information. 
The family court found probable cause to support the Second 
Felony Information and issued a warrant of arrest with bail set 
at $50,000.00.4

4 The Honorable Adrianne N. Heely (District Court Judge) presided. 
3   
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On December 26, 2017, the State filed an "Ex-Parte 
Motion to Recall Bench Warrant and Motion to Dismiss Without 
Prejudice" as to the First Felony Information in circuit court, which was granted.
5 
Amasiu moved to dismiss his case as the Second Felony 
Information was "filed outside the statute of limitations 
provided for in [Hawai‘ i] Revised Statute Section 701-108." The 
family court denied the motion to dismiss, and permitted an 
interlocutory appeal. 
(1) In his first point of error on appeal, Amasiu 
contends the family court erred in denying his motion to dismiss 
because the First Felony information "was dismissed prior to 
being served." Amasiu relies on HRS § 701-108(5) (2014), and 
argues "[a]ssuming an Information is within the definition of 'other process' within the meaning of [HRS §] 701-108(5), and 
thus can commence a prosecution, then for an Information to 
commence a prosecution it must be served without unreasonable 
delay." Amasiu concludes that because the First Felony 
Information was never served, it did not commence the 
prosecution and did not toll the statute of limitations. 
Amasiu was charged with Assault in the First Degree, 
which is a class B felony. HRS § 707-710 (2014). A prosecution

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
for a class B felony "must be commenced within three years after 
it is committed[.]" HRS § 701-108(2)(d). This "period of 
limitation does not run . . . [d]uring any time when a prosecution against the accused for the same conduct is pending 
in this State[.]" HRS § 701-108(6)(b) (2014). "A prosecution 
is commenced either when an indictment is found or a complaint 
filed, or when an arrest warrant or other process is issued, 
provided that such warrant or process is executed without 
unreasonable delay." HRS § 701-108(5) (2014). 
Relatedly, HRS § 806-9 (2014) instructs that laws 
applying to indictments apply to an information charging: 
All provisions of law applying to prosecutions upon 
indictments, to writs and process therein, and the issuing 
and service thereof, to motions, pleadings, trials, and 
punishments, or the passing or execution of any sentence, 
and to all proceedings in cases of indictment, whether in 
the court of original or appellate jurisdiction, shall in the same manner and to the same extent as near as may be, 
apply to information and all prosecutions and proceedings 
thereon.  
(Emphases added); State v. Sulenta , 151 Hawaiʻi 372, 514 P.3d 
339, No. CAAP-21-0000555, 2022 WL 2967240 at *5 (App. July 27, 
2022) (SDO) (explaining that "[l]egal precedent and authorities pertaining to complaints and indictments similarly apply to a 
felony information"). Because laws applying to indictments 
apply to information, a charge by information is not treated as 
an "other process" as Amasiu contends. 
5   
 
 
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In prosecuting a felony by information, the written 
information must be "signed by a legal prosecuting officer and 
filed in the court having jurisdiction thereof . . . ." HRS § 806-82 (2014). Furthermore, "[t]he information shall be filed 
in the circuit court[.]" HRS § 806-84(g) (2014); see Hawai‘ i 
Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 7(h)(1) ("An indictment or 
information shall be filed in the circuit court."). And the "family courts shall be divisions of the circuit courts of the 
State." HRS § 571-3 (2018). 
Therefore, when reading HRS § 701-108(5) (prosecution 
commences when indictment found) in pari materia with HRS 
§§ 806-9 (laws regarding indictment apply to information), 806-
82 (informations are filed in court), 806-84(g) (informations 
shall be filed in circuit court), and 571-3 (family courts are divisions of circuit courts), we construe a prosecution by 
information as commencing when the information is filed with the 
circuit (or family) court. 
(2) In his second point of error, Amasiu contends the 
First Felony Information did not toll the statute of limitations 
because (a) the circuit court lacked jurisdiction, and (b) the 
district court judge was not authorized to preside over the 
matter. 
6

(a) Jurisdiction. Amasiu argues the First Felony 
Information did not toll the statute of limitations pursuant to 
HRS § 701-108(6)(b) because it was "filed in a court that lacked jurisdiction" over the case. Relying on HRS §§ 571-14(a)(1) 
(2018) and 806-82, Amasiu maintains the family court had 
exclusive jurisdiction, and the circuit court was without 
jurisdiction.  
HRS § 571-14(a)(1) governs family courts and provides 
in relevant part that "[e]xcept as provided in sections 603-21.5 
. . . , the court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction . . 
. [t]o try any offense committed against a child by the child's 
parent . . . ."
6 As mentioned above, HRS § 806-82 requires the 
written information be "signed by a legal prosecuting officer 
and filed in the court having jurisdiction thereof . . . ." 
But the family courts "are not separate and distinct 
courts from the circuit courts of the State." Winterborne v.
State, 104 Hawai‘ i 311, 314, 88 P.3d 683, 686 (App. 2004). 
Instead, the family courts are divisions of the circuit courts. 
HRS § 571-3 (providing that "family courts shall be divisions of 
the circuit courts of the State"). 
6 HRS § 603- 21.5(b) governs when the circuit court has concurrent 
jurisdiction with the family court. 
7

Here, the First Felony Information was filed in the 
circuit court. About a month later, the Second Felony 
Information was filed in family court and the First Felony Information was dismissed. Because the family courts are 
divisions of the circuit court, any potential jurisdictional 
defect in filing the First Felony Information in circuit court 
for purposes of tolling the statute of limitations was 
immaterial. See State v. Pedro, 149 
Hawai‘i 256, 263 n.2, 488 
P.3d 1235, 1242 n.2 (2021) (explaining "[a]ny potential 
jurisdictional defect [was] immaterial" because the circuit 
court "had jurisdiction under HRS § 603-21.5, and family courts 
are divisions of the circuit courts of the State") (citation and 
internal quotation marks omitted). 
(b)
 District Court Judge. Amasiu next argues that to 
toll the statute of limitations, a circuit court judge, not a district court judge, was required to determine probable cause 
of the First Felony Information. 
HRS § 806-85(a) (2014) provides that "[w]hen an 
information is filed, the court having jurisdiction shall review 
the information and its exhibit to determine whether there is 
probable cause to believe that the offense charged was committed 
and that the defendant committed the offense charged." 
(Emphasis added.) HRS § 806-85(d) (2014) defines "court having 
8

jurisdiction" and "court" as the circuit court, "provided that 
the chief justice may by order authorize district court judges 
to make probable cause determinations, set bail, and direct the issuance of arrest warrants[.]" 
On February 15, 2005, Chief Justice Ronald T.Y. Moon 
(Ret.) ordered, in the matter of information charging, "that the 
District Judges of the First, Second, Third, and Fifth Circuits 
of the State of Hawai‘i are hereby authorized to make probable 
cause determinations, set bail, and direct the issuance of 
arrest warrants[.]"7 Also relevant is Chief Justice Moon's 
October 29, 1996 order assigning district court judges "to temporarily preside in the circuit courts of their respective 
circuits, on an as needed basis."

Here, the order finding probable cause was captioned 
as "IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT" and signed by

The February 15, 2005 order refers to Act 62, section 1 
"of the 2004 
Hawai‘i Session Laws, and the provisions of [HRS] § 806- E(d)."  The referenced 
HRS § 806- E(d) is identical to HRS § 806- 85(d), which defines "court having 
jurisdiction" and "court" as the circuit court, "provided that the chief justice may by order authorize district court judges to make probable cause 
determinations, set bail, and direct the issuance of arrest warrants, as provided by this section."

Judge Kobayashi as "Judge of the above-captioned Court" on 
November 22, 2017. We take judicial notice that Judge Kobayashi 
was sworn in as a judge of the District Court of the Second 
Circuit on October 12, 2010. Hawai‘i Rules of Evidence Rule 201. 
Although Judge Kobayashi was a district court judge, 
the chief justice may authorize district court judges to make 
probable cause determinations where the charge is by information pursuant to HRS § 806-85(d). 
And Chief Justice Moon did so in 
the February 15, 2005 order. Thus, that the probable cause determination was made by a district court judge does not 
support Amasiu's contention that the statute of limitation did 
not toll. 
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the family court's 
August 19, 2021 Order Denying Motion to Dismiss.
