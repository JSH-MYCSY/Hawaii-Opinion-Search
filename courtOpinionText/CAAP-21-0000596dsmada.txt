NO. CAAP-21-0000596 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I  
IN THE INTEREST OF TJ  
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(FC-S NO. 14-00008) 
ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL 
(By:  Wadsworth, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and Chan, JJ.)  
Upon consideration of the October 25, 2022 Stipulation 
to Dismiss Appeal by Appellant Mother (Appellant), which this 
court construes as a Motion to Dismiss (Motion to Dismiss), the 
papers in support, and the record, it appears that we no longer 
have jurisdiction over Appellant's appeal from the October 11, 2021 "Decision and Order Regarding Contested Hearing on Motion to Terminate Parental Rights Filed August 27, 2019," (Order 
Terminating Parental Rights) because the judgment has been 
vacated and the appeal is now moot. 
On June 1, 2022, we granted Appellant's request to 
remand this case under 
Life of the Land v. Ariyoshi
, 57 Haw. 249, 
251, 553 P.2d 464, 465-66 (1976), to the family court after the 
family court indicated it intended to approve a motion pursuant to Rule 60(b) of the 
Hawai# i Family Court Rules and vacate the 
Order Terminating Parental Rights.  On June 28, 2022, the family court entered an order vacating the Order Terminating Parental Rights.  Because the judgment from which this appeal was taken has been vacated, this appeal is now moot.  
See In Re Marn 
Family
, 141 Hawai# i 1, 7, 403 P.3d 621, 627 (2016) ("As a general NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
rule, a case is moot if the reviewing court can no longer grant 
effective relief.").  
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion to 
Dismiss is granted and the appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, November 1, 2022.
