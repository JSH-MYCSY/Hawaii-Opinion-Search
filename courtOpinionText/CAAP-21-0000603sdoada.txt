APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 1CCV-20-0001512) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
Plaintiff-Appellant State of Hawai‘i Organization of 
Police Officers (SHOPO) appeals from the Circuit Court of the 
First Circuit's September 30, 2021 Final Judgment and April 14, 
2021 order denying SHOPO's motion for preliminary injunction.1 
On appeal, SHOPO raises six points of error, contending Act 47 
1 The Honorable Dean E. Ochiai presided.   
 
 
 
  
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2020)'s amendments violate its members' right to: (1) privacy; 
(2) organize; (3) procedural due process; (4) substantive due 
process; (5) equal protection; and (6) prohibition against 
impairment of contracts. 
Defendant-Appellee City and County of Honolulu, 
Intervenor/Defendant-Appellee State of Hawai‘i, and 
Intervenor/Defendant-Appellee Honolulu Civil Beat filed answering briefs countering SHOPO's contentions, and the 
American Civil Liberties Union of Hawai‘ i Foundation submitted an 
amicus brief supporting the defendants. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve the 
points of error as discussed below, and affirm. 
(1) In its first point of error, SHOPO contends the 
circuit court "erred in finding that Act 47's amendments did not 
violate a county police officer's right to privacy by mandating 
disclosure of disciplinary records before the highest 
nonjudicial grievance adjustment procedure timely invoked by the employee or the employee's representative has concluded." 
SHOPO argues that "officers have a constitutional 
right to privacy in their employment records in general, 
2   
 
 
 
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
including pending discipline matters." However, the Hawai‘ i 
Supreme Court has ruled "information regarding a police 
officer's misconduct in the course of his or her duties as a 
police officer is not within the protection of Hawai‘i's 
constitutional right to privacy . . . ." State of Hawai‘i Org. 
of Police Officers v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu
, 149 Hawai‘ i 492, 
511, 494 P.3d 1225, 1244 (2021) (explaining that this holding 
"remains good law") (quoting 
State of Hawai‘i Org. of Police 
Officers v. Soc'y of Pro. Journalists-Univ. of Hawai‘ i Chapter 
(
SHOPO v. SPJ
), 83 Hawai‘i 378, 397, 927 P.3d 386, 405 (1996), 
superseded by statute
, 1995 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 242 § 1 at 641-
42, as recognized in Peer News LLC v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu
, 
138 Hawai‘i 53, 63-65, 376 P.3d 1, 11-13 (2016)). 
SHOPO also argues Act 47's amendments created an 
"internal inconsistency" between Hawai‘i Revised Statutes (HRS) 
§§ 92F-14(b)(4)(B) (Supp. 2021) and 52D-3.5 (Supp. 2021). Based 
on the amendment to HRS § 52D-3.5, each police department must 
report to the legislature "the identity of the police officer 
upon the police officer's suspension or discharge." Under HRS 
§ 92F-14(a) (2012) and (b)(4)(B), a government agency must 
disclose the name of an employee whose misconduct resulted in 
suspension or discharge when, among other things, "the highest 
3   
 
 
 
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
nonjudicial grievance adjustment procedure timely invoked by the 
employee or the employee's representative has concluded . . ." 
or "public interest in disclosure outweighs the privacy interest 
of the individual." Because both statutes detail the 
circumstances under which the officer's name must be provided, 
and neither statute provides a right to nondisclosure, there is no "internal inconsistency." See SHOPO v. City & Cnty. of
Honolulu
, 149 Hawai‘i at 497, 507, 494 P.3d at 1230, 1240 
(explaining that HRS chapter 92F, the Uniform Information 
Practices Act (UIPA), "simply provides no right of 
nondisclosure"). 
(2)  Next, in its second, third, fourth, and sixth 
points of error, SHOPO contends Act 47's amendments violated its 
members' right to: organize for the purpose of collective 
bargaining; procedural due process; substantive due process; and 
prohibition against impairment of contract. For these points, 
SHOPO relies on its collective bargaining agreement (or CBA) asserting that a conflict exists between the requirement to 
disclose the identity of the police officer under HRS § 52D-3.5 
and the grievance procedures under its collective bargaining 
agreement. 
4   
 
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Curiously, in challenging UIPA disclosures in SHOPO v. 
City & Cnty. of Honolulu, SHOPO proffered that "the disclosures 
required by HRS § 52D-3.5 . . . would suffice to meet Civil 
Beat's request without violating the CBA." 149 Hawai‘i at 520, 
494 P.3d at 1253 (emphasis added). Nonetheless, assuming 
arguendo a conflict exists between HRS § 52D-3.5 and the 
collective bargaining agreement, the county police departments 
cannot bargain away their duties under HRS § 52D-3.5. See id.(explaining that "an agency may not collectively bargain away 
its duties under UIPA – compliance with the statute is 'non-
negotiable'") (quoting SHOPO v. SPJ, 83 Hawai‘ i at 404-05, 927 
P.2d at 412-13). HRS § 52D-3.5 requires each county police 
department to report certain information to the legislature, 
such as disclosing the officer's identity upon suspension or 
discharge. And the police departments must comply. See 149 
Hawai‘i at 520, 494 P.3d at 1253 (explaining that an "agency must 
comply with UIPA, and if the CBA would prevent that, it is unenforceable") (citing SHOPO v. SPJ, 83 Hawai‘ i at 404-05, 927 
P.2d at 412-13). 
(3)  Finally, in its fifth point of error, SHOPO 
contends the circuit court erred by finding "Act 47's amendments 
did not violate the equal protection rights of SHOPO and its 
members . . . ." 
SHOPO argues "Act 47 deprives county police 
officers of the same due process rights enjoyed by other public 
5   
 
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
employees" and treating "county police officers differently than 
other law enforcement officers with the same 'police powers' 
does not have a fair and substantial relation to the objective 
of Act 4 [sic] nor is it supported by a rational basis." 
(Emphasis omitted.) 
Contrary to SHOPO's contention, the legislature 
provided a rational basis for disclosing the identity of a police officer upon suspension or discharge. Nagle v. Bd. of
Educ., 63 Haw. 389, 393, 629 P.2d 109, 112 (1981) (explaining "[w]here 'suspect' classifications or fundamental rights are not 
at issue, this court has traditionally employed the rational 
basis test"). The legislature explained the purpose of Act 47 
was to "enhance the public's trust in law enforcement," and found "public trust in law enforcement is critical to ensuring 
justice" and "the difficult and often dangerous job of law 
enforcement is safer, easier, and more effectively executed when 
citizens trust those empowered to serve and protect them." 2020 
Haw. Sess. Laws Act 47, § 1 at 364. Thus, "requiring disclosure 
of the identities of suspended or discharged county police 
officers to the Legislature will improve oversight of police 
departments in cases of severe misconduct." Conf. Comm. Rep. 
No. 3-20, in 2020 House Journal, at 909-10, 2020 Senate Journal, at 577-78 (2020).

Based on the foregoing, we affirm the circuit court's 
September 30, 2021 Final Judgment and April 14, 2021 order 
denying SHOPO's motion for preliminary injunction.
