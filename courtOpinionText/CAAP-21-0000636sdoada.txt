(Judgment of Conviction)  and the March 14, 2022 Order Denying

On October 13, 2021, Leano-Castro was convicted of 
Unauthorized Entry into Motor Vehicle in the First Degree 
(Unauthorized Entry), in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes 
(HRS) § 708-836.5 (2014).  The Circuit Court initially sentenced 
Leano-Castro to four (4) years probation, subject to 
mandatory/special conditions, including: (1) serve one year in jail, with credit for time served, subject to early release into a residential substance abuse treatment program; (2) pay $816.23 in restitution; and (3) "zero tolerance" probation.  After 
various post-sentencing developments and proceedings, on January 19, 2023, the Circuit Court issued an Order of Resentencing 
Revocation of Probation; Notice of Entry (Order of Resentencing), 
resentencing Leano-Castro to four (4) years probation, subject to 
special conditions, including: (1) serve a term of imprisonment of one year, with credit for time served, subject to early release upon Leano-Castro's acceptance and entry into a 32
2 HRS § 708-836.5 states: 
§ 708-836.5 Unauthorized entry into motor vehicle in

unauthorized entry into motor vehicle in the first degree if
the person intentionally or knowingly enters or remainsunlawfully in a motor vehicle, without being invited,licensed, or otherwise authorized to enter or remain withinthe vehicle, with the intent to commit a crime against aperson or against property rights.
(2) Unauthorized entry into motor vehicle in the first
degree is a class C felony.

residential substance abuse program, and (2) pay a free standing 
order of restitution in the amount of $816.23.   4 
In these consolidated appeals, Leano-Castro raises two 
points of error, contending that the Circuit Court erred in: (1) ordering restitution because Leano-Castro did not scratch the 
driver's door as claimed by the complaining witness (CW); and (2) 
denying Leano-Castro's motion to correct his initial sentence. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve Leano-Castro's points of error as follows: 
(1) Leano-Castro asserts that there is insufficient 
evidence to order him to pay $816.23 in restitution under HRS § 706-646 (Supp. 2022).  Generally, a court shall order a

5 HRS § 706-646 states, in pertinent part: 
§ 706-646 Victim restitution. 
. . . . 
(2) The court shall order the defendant to make 
restitution for reasonable and verified losses suffered by
the victim or victims as a result of the defendant's offense when requested by the victim. 
The court shall order 
restitution to be paid to the crime victim compensationcommission if the victim has been given an award forcompensation under chapter 351. If the court orders paymentof a fine in addition to restitution or a compensation fee,or both, the payment of restitution and compensation feeshall be made pursuant to section 706-651.
(3) [Subsection effective until December 31, 2023 
. . . .] In ordering restitution, the court shall not
consider the defendant's financial ability to makerestitution in determining the amount of restitution toorder. The court, however, shall consider the defendant'sfinancial ability to make restitution for the purpose ofestablishing the time and manner of payment. The court shall specify the time and manner in which restitution is to

defendant to pay restitution for losses suffered by the victim as 
a result of the defendant's offense when requested by the victim. See HRS § 706-646(2). In State v. DeMello, the 
Hawai#i Supreme 
Court affirmed that § 706-646(2) imposes four requirements before restitution must be awarded, the victim's losses must be: (1) reasonable, (2) verified, (3) suffered as a result of the defendant's conduct, and (4) requested by the victim. 136 Hawai#i 193, 196, 361 P.3d 420, 423 (2015). Leano-Castro argues 
that the Circuit Court egregiously erred by finding that requirement (3) was established by a preponderance of the evidence, and that the evidence presented by the State was insufficient to meet their burden of proof regarding requirements 
(1) and (2).  
Here, CW informed responding Honolulu Police Department 
(
HPD) officers that the scratch was not there prior to Leano-
Castro's unlawful entry, as evidenced by a body-cam video. CW 
was away from his vehicle for roughly one-hour and fifteen minutes. Security camera footage did not capture any other

be paid. While the defendant is in the custody of the
department of public safety, restitution shall be collectedpursuant to chapter 353 and any court-ordered paymentschedule shall be suspended. Restitution shall be a dollar amount that is sufficient to reimburse any victim fully forlosses, including but not limited to:
(a) Full value of stolen or damaged property, asdetermined by replacement costs of likeproperty, or the actual or estimated cost ofrepair, if repair is possible;
(b) Medical expenses, which shall include mentalhealth treatment, counseling, and therapy;
(c) Funeral and burial expenses; and
(d) Lost earnings, which shall include paid leave.

person in the immediate vicinity of CW's vehicle. Although 
Leano-Castro elicited evidence that he did not have any tools or sharp objects on him when he was arrested, "it is within the province of the trier of fact to weigh the evidence and to assess the credibility of the witnesses, and this court will refrain from interfering in those determinations[.]" Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Wailea Elua v. Wailea Resort Co., 100 
Hawai#i 97, 117-
18, 58 P.3d 608, 628-29 (2002) (citation omitted). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to support an award of restitution. See State v. Phillips, 138 Hawai# i 321, 352, 382 
P.3d 133, 164 (2016); State v. Kelly, CAAP-18-0000054, 2020 WL 3124586, *1 (Haw. App. June 12, 2020) (SDO), and State v. Foumai, CAAP-17-0000093, 2018 WL 495679, *1 (Haw. App. Jan. 22, 2018) (mem. op.). 
Leano-Castro further argues that the amount of 
restitution ordered by the Circuit Court was not reasonable or verified because the CW produced only one estimate. Leano-Castro provides no support for this argument. 
We conclude it is without 
merit. 
(2) Leano-Castro argues that the Circuit Court erred 
and abused its discretion in denying the motion to correct his initial sentence, contending that the "zero tolerance" probation condition was unauthorized and otherwise impermissible. However, the court later issued the Order of Resentencing on January 19, 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2023, without the challenged probation condition. We can no 
longer grant effective relief. Therefore, the issue is moot. 
See Kaho#ohanohano  v. State
, 114 Hawai#i 302, 332, 162 P.3d 696, 
726 (2007). 
Leano-Castro argues the "zero tolerance" condition 
qualifies under the "capable of repetition, yet evading review" exception to the mootness doctrine. 
However, the fact remains 
that the only relief available would be resentencing without that particular condition, which was done here. We decline to follow Leano-Castro's hypotheticals as to what might happen under different re-sentencing circumstances and decline to address such speculative circumstances in the context of this appeal. Leano-Castro's arguments that public policy exception and/or the collateral consequences exception apply are equally unpersuasive. 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's October 13, 2021 
Judgment of Conviction and November 9, 2021 Restitution Order are affirmed; the appeal from the March 14, 2022 Order Denying Motion to Correct is dismissed as moot.
