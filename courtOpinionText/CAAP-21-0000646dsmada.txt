NO. CAAP-21-0000646 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
WN, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
SM, Respondent-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(FC-M NO. 14-1-0034K) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, McCullen and Chan, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears this court lacks 
appellate jurisdiction over Petitioner-Appellant WN's appeal from 
the October 19, 2021 Order After Status Conference (Status 
Order), entered by the Family Court of the Third Circuit in FC-M 
No. 14-1-0034K, because the Status Order is not a final 
appealable order. 
Pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (
HRS) ยง 571-54 
(2018), "appeals in family court cases, as in other civil cases, may be taken only from (1) a final judgment, order, or decree, . . . or (2) a certified interlocutory order." 
In re Doe
, 
96 Hawai# i 272, 283, 30 P.3d 878, 889 (2001) (citations omitted). 
"Final order means an order ending the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be accomplished." 
Familian Northwest, Inc. v. 
Cent. Pac. Boiler & Piping, Ltd.
, 68 Haw. 368, 370, 714 P.2d 936, 
937 (1986) (cleaned up). 
As the Status Order expressly set the underlying matter 
for further status, it is not a final order ending the proceedings leaving nothing further to be accomplished. Moreover, the Family Court did not certify the Status 
Order as an appealable interlocutory order. 
Finally, as WN is not the child's parent, he has no 
"fundamental liberty interest" in the custody and care of the 
child to trigger the exception to the finality rule. See In re 
Doe
, 77 Hawai# i 109, 115, 883 P.2d 30, 36 (1994) (noting that 
"parents have 'fundamental liberty interest[s]' in the care, custody, and management of the child") (citation omitted). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is 
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 
DATED: 
Honolulu, Hawai# i, August 26, 2022.
