IN  THE  INTERMEDIATE  COURT  OF  APPEALS 
OF  THE  STATE  OF  HAWAI I 
OLGA  V.  HARRISON,  Petitioner-Appellant,  v. 
JOHN  W.  HARRISON,  Respondent-Appellee 
APPEAL  FROM  THE  FAMILY  COURT  OF  THE  SECOND  CIRCUIT 
(FC-DA  NO.  21-1-0492) 
ORDER  DISMISSING  APPEAL 
(By:   Leonard,  Acting  Chief  Judge,  Hiraoka  and  McCullen,  JJ.) 
Upon review
 of the record, it appears that: 
(1) On
 May 5, 2022, the court denied without prejudice 
Respondent-Appellee John Harrison's March 28, 2022 Motion to 
Dismiss Appeal and Impose Sanctions, struck self-represented 
Petitioner-Appellant Olga V. Harrison's (Appellant) January 10, 
2022 opening brief, and ordered Appellant to file, within 
fourteen days from the order, a first amended opening brief that 
complies with Hawai i Rules  of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 
Rule 28(b) and 32, and is not written in a foreign language; 
(2) Appellant did not file a first amended opening 
brief or request an extension of time; 
(3) On May 25, 2022, the appellate clerk entered a 
default of amended opening brief, indicating the matter would be 
called to the court's attention on June 6, 2022, for action that

could include dismissal, under HRAP Rule 30, and Appellant could 
seek relief from default by motion; and 
(4) Appellant took no further action in this appeal. 
Therefore,  IT  IS   HEREBY  ORDERED  that  the  appeal  is 
dismissed,  under  HRAP  Rule  30. 
DATED:   Honolulu,  Hawai  i,  November  1,   2024.
