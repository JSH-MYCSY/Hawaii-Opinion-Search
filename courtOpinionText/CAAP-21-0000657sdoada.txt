ROBSON R. PARO, Claimant-Appellant-Appellant,
v. 
HAWAII HOME MANAGEMENT & CLEANING SERVICE LLC,
Employer-Appellee-Appellee,
and 
FIRST INSURANCE COMPANY OF HAWAII, LTD.,
Insurance Carrier-Appellee-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD 
(CASE NO. AB 2021-130 and DCD NO. 2-20-45502) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Claimant-Appellant-Appellant Robson R. 
Paro appeals 
from the Decision and Order filed by the Labor and Industrial 
Relations Appeals Board (LIRAB) on October 20, 2021. For the 
reasons explained below, we affirm. 
Paro was employed by Employer-Appellee-Appellee Hawaii 
Home Management & Cleaning Service LLC. He was injured while 
working on July 14, 2020. He made a claim for workers compensation benefits. The Department of Labor and Industrial Relations (DLIR) Disability Compensation Division conducted a 
hearing on April 27, 2021. The Director of the DLIR concluded 
that Paro's injury was not compensable. The Director's Decision NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
was filed and mailed to Paro on August 6, 2021. The Decision 
stated, in part: 
APPEAL: This decision may be appealed by filing a written
notice of appeal with the Director of Labor and IndustrialRelations or the Director's county representative withintwenty days after a copy of this decision has been sent . 
(Emphasis added.) 
August 26, 2021 was the twentieth day after the 
Decision was filed and mailed.1 Paro filed a notice of appeal on 
August 27, 2021. LIRAB filed an order to show cause why the 
appeal should not be dismissed as untimely. Paro filed a response. Citing the Merriam-Webster dictionary, he stated that the word "sent" is the past participle of "send," and that a past participle "typically expresses completed action[.]"  He claimed 
to have received the Decision on August 9, 2021, which was when 
the "sending" of the Decision was completed. Thus, he argued, the director's Decision was "sent" on August 9, 2021, and his August 27, 2021 notice of appeal was timely. 
A hearing on the order to show cause was held on 
October 14, 2021.
2 LIRAB's Decision and Order was filed on 
October 20, 2021. LIRAB found and concluded that "[t]he Director's decision was dated and sent to the parties on August 6, 2021" and Paro's notice of appeal was filed "on August 27, 2021, one (1) day after the due date for filing of August 26, 2021." LIRAB dismissed Paro's appeal. 
This appeal followed. "Appellate review of a LIRAB decision is governed by 
the provisions of the Hawai# i Administrative Procedure Act 
relating to judicial review of agency action." Ihara v. State 
Dep't of Land & Nat. Res., 141 Hawai# i 36, 41, 404 P.3d 302, 307 
(2017) (citations omitted). The Act provides, in relevant part: 
1 Pursuant to Rule 201 of the Hawaii Rules of Evidence, we take
judicial notice that August 26, 2021 was a Thursday, and not a state holiday.
See Hawaii Revised Statutes § 8-1. 
2 The record on appeal does not contain a transcript of the hearing.

Upon review of the record, the court may affirm the decision
of the agency or remand the case with instructions forfurther proceedings; or it may reverse or modify thedecision and order if the substantial rights of thepetitioners may have been prejudiced because theadministrative findings, conclusions, decisions, or ordersare: 
(1) In violation of constitutional or statutory
provisions; 
(2) In excess of the statutory authority or
jurisdiction of the agency; 
(3) Made upon unlawful procedure; 
(4) Affected by other error of law; (5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,
probative, and substantial evidence on the whole
record; or 
(6) Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized by
abuse of discretion or clearly unwarrantedexercise of discretion. 
HRS § 91-14(g) (Supp. 2019). 
LIRAB's Decision and Order was based upon Hawaii 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 386-87(a) (2015). The statute provides, 
in relevant part: 
(a) A decision of the director shall be final and 
conclusive between the parties, except as provided in
section 386-89, unless within twenty days after a copy has 
been sent  to each party, either party appeals therefrom to
the appellate board by filing a written notice of appealwith the appellate board or the department. 
(Emphasis added.) The issue on appeal is: when is a decision of 
the director "sent" for purposes of HRS § 386-87(a)? 
"It is well-established that when a statute's language 
is plain and unmistakable, the court is bound by the plain, clear and unambiguous language of the statute." State v. Mortensen-
Young, 152 Hawai# i 385, 396, 526 P.3d 362, 373 (2023) (cleaned 
up). 
Accordingly, we first examine the plain, clear, and 
unambiguous meaning of the word "sent." According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, sent is the "past tense and past 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
participle of SEND[.]"3 Synonyms for sent include transmitted 
and dispatched.4 Antonyms for sent include received.5 Thus, 
under the plain meaning of HRS § 386-87(a), the director's 
decision is "sent to each party" when it is transmitted or dispatched — mailed — by the DCD to each party, not when it is actually received by any party. 
Paro argues that because subsection (d) of HRS § 386-87 
uses the word "mailing" to describe when various other deadlines begin to run,
6 the word "sent" in subsection (a) must mean 
something other than "mailed." See Agustin v. Dan Ostrow Const. 
Co., 64 Haw. 80, 83, 636 P.2d 1348, 1351 (1981) ("[D]ifferent words in a statute are presumed to have different meanings."). Paro's argument lacks merit. The director's decision is sent to the parties under HRS § 386-87(a) when it is transmitted or dispatched by the DCD, which could include — but is not limited to — mailing by the DCD. But requiring that the decision actually be received by any party to be considered sent by the DCD contradicts the plain, clear, and unambiguous language of HRS § 386-87(a).

6 HRS § 386-87(d) (2015) provides: 
(d) In the absence of an appeal and within thirty
days after mailing of a certified copy of the appellate
board's decision or order, the appellate board may, upon the
application of the director or any other party, or upon itsown motion, reopen the matter and thereupon may take furtherevidence or may modify its findings, conclusions ordecisions. The time to initiate judicial review shall runfrom the date of mailing of the further decision if the 
matter has been reopened. If the application for reopeningis denied, the time to initiate judicial review shall runfrom the date of mailing of the denial decision. 
(Emphasis added.) 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
LIRAB's combined finding and conclusion that the 
Director's Decision was sent to Paro on August 6, 2021, is 
supported by substantial evidence in the record, is not clearly erroneous, and reflects a correct application of HRS § 386-87(a). LIRAB's combined finding and conclusion that Paro's notice of appeal was filed "on August 27, 2021, one (1) day after the due date for filing of August 26, 2021" is also supported by substantial evidence in the record, is not clearly erroneous, and reflects a correct application of HRS § 386-87(a). Accordingly, LIRAB's Decision and Order filed on October 20, 2021, is affirmed.
