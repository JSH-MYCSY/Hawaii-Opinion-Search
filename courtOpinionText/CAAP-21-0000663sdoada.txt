(Foreclosure Order), and (2) Judgment, both entered on 
October 12, 2021 by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit 
(circuit court ). 1 The Foreclosure Order and Judgment were 
entered in favor of Plaintiff -Appellee HSBC Bank USA, National 
Association, as Trustee for the Holders of the Certificates 
Issued by Deutsche ALT-A Securities Mortgage Loan Trust, Series 
2006-AR3 (HSBC Bank ). 
The summary judgment record reflects that Scardino 
owned real estate in Honolulu (the Property ). In May 2006, 
Scardino executed a $318,400 promissory note ( Note) in favor of 
Meridias Capital, Inc. ( Meridias ). Scardino secured the Note 
with a mortgage on the Property (the Mortgage ). The Mortgage 
identified Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. 
(MERS), solely as nominee for Merid ias, as mortgagee. The 
Mortgage was assigned to HSBC Bank by assignment of mortgage 
recorded on September 3, 2008 ; the Note was specially indorsed 
to HSBC Bank . Specialized Loan Servicing LLC ( SLS) serviced the 
loan. 
Scardino defaulted on the Note in April 2008. HSBC 
Bank sent Scardino notice of the default and acceleration of the 
loan (Notice) in June 2010 . The Notice provided Scardino 30 
days to cure the default. Scardino did not timely cure the

default, and HSBC Bank filed a Complaint for Mortgage 
Foreclosure (the Complaint ) on October 16, 2019. 
HSBC Bank moved for summary judgment and interlocutory 
decree of foreclosure in June 2021 . The circuit court granted 
HSBC Bank's Motion for Summary Judgment (MSJ), and entered 
Judgment. On appeal, Scardino appears to contend that the 
circuit court erred by granting HSBC Bank's MSJ because HSBC 
Bank lacked standing to bring the foreclosure action . 
Upon careful review of the record and relevant legal 
authorities , and having given due consideration to the arguments 
advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve 
Scardino's contention as follows . 
We review the circuit court's grant of summary 
judgment de novo, applying the following standard, 
[S]ummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, 
depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on 
file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there 
is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the 
moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  A 
fact is material if proof of that fact would have the 
effect of establishing or refuting one of the essential 
elements of a cause of action or defense asserted by the 
parties.  The evidence must be viewed in the light most 
favorable to the non -moving party.  In other words, we must 
view all of the evidence and inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.

HSBC Bank , as the foreclosing party, "must [ inter 
alia] prove its entitlement to enforce the note and mortgage."

Bank of Am., N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawaiʻi 361, 367, 390  P.3d 
1248, 1254 (2017). In Reyes-Toledo, the Hawai ʻi Supreme Court 
held that,  
A foreclosing plaintiff's burden to prove entitlement to 
enforce the note overlaps with the requirements of standing 
in foreclosure actions as standing is concerned with 
whether the parties have the right to bring suit. 
Typically, a plaintiff does not have standing to invoke the 
jurisdiction of the court unless the plaintiff has suffered 
an injury in fact. A mortgage is a conveyance of an 
interest in real property that is given as security for the 
payment of the note. A foreclosure action is a legal 
proceeding to gain title or force a sale of the property 
for satisfaction of a note that is in default and secured 
by a lien on the subject property. Thus, the underlying 
"injury in fact" to a foreclosing plaintiff is the 
mortgagee's failure to satisfy its obligation to pay the 
debt obligation to the note holder. Accordingly, in 
establishing standing, a foreclosing plaintiff must 
necessarily prove its entitlement to enforce the note as it 
is the default on the note that gives rise to the action. 
Id. at 367-68, 390 P.3d at 1254 -55 (cleaned up). 
Here, the summary judgment record reflects that HSBC 
Bank provided the circuit court with: (1) the  October 25, 2019  
Declaration of Sylvia Meregillano  (Meregillano ), the Custodian 
of Records for HSBC Bank's legal counsel,  TMLF Hawaii LLLC  
(TMLF), who declared under penalty of perjury that "[a]ccording 
to the records and files of [TMLF], on 11/29/2016, [TMLF]  was in 
possession of the original Note, specially indorsed to [HSBC Bank],. . .[o]n 10/16/2019, the date [the Complaint]  was filed, 
[HSBC Bank], through counsel, was in possession of the original 
Note, specially indorsed to [HSBC Bank]," and that the original 
Note  was stored at TMLF's "designated storage facility in a 
fire-proof safe"; (2) the  November 25, 2016  Bailee Letter to 
4    
 
 
  
 
 
  
   
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
TMLF, authenticated by Meregillano; (3) the May 26, 2021 
Declaration of Indebtedness and on Prior Business Records of 
Steven Ross, Second Assistant Vice President of SL S, who 
declared under penalty of perjury that he has "personal 
knowledge of SL S's procedures for creating" its business records 
and is authorized to provide verification of these records, and 
that "SLS's records indicate that [HSBC Bank], by and through 
its counsel, had possession of the original Note, specially 
indorsed to [HSBC Bank], as of 10/16/2019, the date of the 
filing of the Complaint in this foreclosure ," and (4) the Note , 
Mortgage, and Assignment of Mortgage to HSBC Bank. 
On this record, we conclude that HSBC Bank satisfied 
its initial burden on summary judgment. See  U.S. Bank Tr., 
N.A.  v. Verhagen, 149 Hawaiʻi 315, 328, 489 P.3d 419, 432  (2021) 
("Collectively, the evidence presented by U.S. Bank []  
establishes the bank's possession of the Note on the day the 
complaint was filed.").  
The burden then shifted to Scardino, and Scardino did 
not meet his burden of establishing that there is a genuine 
question of material fact for trial. See Id. at 328, 489 P.3d 
at 432 ("[A] defendant may counter this inference of possession 
at the time of filing with evidence setting forth 'specific 
facts showing that there is a genuine issue' as to whether the 
plaintiff actually possessed the subject note at the time it 
5    
 
 
  
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
   
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
filed suit.") (citing Hawai ʻi Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 
56(e)). Scardino offered no evidence that HSBC Bank, through 
its counsel, did not possess the Note at the time the Complaint 
was filed. Nor did Scardino provide evidence to support his 
contention that HSBC Bank "falsified" the Note. 
For the foregoing reasons, we  affirm  the circuit 
court's  Foreclosure Order and Judgment, filed October 12, 2021.   2
