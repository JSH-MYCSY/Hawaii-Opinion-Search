Third-Party Plaintiff-Appellee, v. HEP YANEZGUINN, also known as HEPHZIBAH YANEZ LUSICA,Third-Party Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 1CC191000820) 
ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Chan, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of the Third Motion to Dismiss 
(Motion to Dismiss), filed August 11, 2022, by Third-Party 
Plaintiff/Appellee State of 
Hawai# i by its Office of Consumer 
Protection (OCP), the papers in support, the record, and noting 
no opposition, it appears that: 
(1) On December 29, 2021, the appeal was docketed, and 
the opening brief was due by February 7, 2022; 
(2) Self-represented Defendant/Crossclaim Defendant/ 
Third-Party Defendant-Appellant Hep Yanez Guinn, also known as 
Hephzibah Yanez Lusica (
Guinn), failed to file the opening brief 
and did not request an extension of time until April 8, 2022; 
(3) The court granted Guinn's April 8, 2022 request for 
an extension of time to file the opening brief, and subsequent extension requests, extending the deadline to June 13, 2022; 
(4) Guinn again failed to file the opening brief, and 
on June 22, 2022, the appellate clerk entered a default notice informing her that the time for filing the opening brief had expired, the matter would be called to the court's attention on July 5, 2022, for appropriate action, which could include dismissal of the appeal, under Hawai# i Rules of Appellate 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Procedure Rule 30, and Guinn could request relief from default by 
motion; 
(5) On June 28, 2022, Guinn filed what the court 
construed as a motion for relief from default and an extension of time to file the opening brief. The court granted the motion and extended the opening brief deadline to August 1, 2022, with no further extensions absent extraordinary circumstances, and cautioned Guinn that any further default of the opening brief may result in sanctions, including, without limitation, monetary sanctions, the appeal being dismissed, or both; 
(6) Guinn failed to file the opening brief or request 
another extension of time, and therefore is in default of the opening brief a third time in this appeal; 
(7) In the Motion to Dismiss, OCP seeks to dismiss the 
appeal due to Guinn's default; and 
(8) Guinn has not moved for relief from default, filed 
a response to the Motion to Dismiss, or taken any other action in this appeal. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion to 
Dismiss is granted, and the appeal is dismissed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, December 21, 2022.
