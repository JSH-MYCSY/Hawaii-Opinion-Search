entered on March 4, 2019, ( Order Regarding Petition ), in the 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit ( circuit court ).2 
In 2005, Makekau was convicted of sexually assaulting 
a minor ( the CW). Makekau appealed, and this court affirmed. 
State v. Makekau , Nos. 27622 & 27744, 2007 WL 5210472 (Haw. App. 
Dec. 31, 2007) (mem. op.). On December 7, 2016, Makekau filed a 
HRPP Rule 40 Petition for Post -Conviction Relief ( Rule 40 
Petition ). Makekau alleged that his trial counsel was 
ineffective by: (1) not presenting evidence of bias and motive 
of the CW to fabricate the accusations against Makekau; (2) not 
objecting to expert witness testimony of Dr. Victoria Schneider 
(Dr. Schneider ), who interviewed the CW, which unfairly 
bolstered the CW's credibility; (3) failing to call a rebuttal 
expert witness to counter Dr. Schneider's testimony; and (4) 
failing to request a jury instru ction that a rape charge is 
easily made but difficult to disprove. Makekau also alleged 
that appellate counsel was ineffective for not raising 
ineffectiveness of trial counsel. 
The circuit court found only one colorable claim for 
relief: that trial counsel was ineffective for not presenting 
evidence of bias and motive of the CW to fabricate the 
accusations against Makekau. Makekau contended that, after he

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
ended an eleven -year relationship with the CW's mother, the CW's 
mother harassed him and struck him with her car in December 2003 
(December 2003 incident ), requiring him to seek emergency 
medical treatment. Makekau alleged that when he refused to 
assure the CW's mother that he did not, or would not, call the 
police to report the December 2003 incident, the CW's mother 
threatened to have the CW say that Mak ekau molested the CW. 
Makekau claims he told his trial counsel about the 
December 2003 incident, and that his trial counsel refused to 
present the incident as part of his defense because it was only 
after Makekau was arrested for the sexual assault charges that 
Makekau's mother called the prosecutor's office to inquire about 
pressing charges over the incident. 
The circuit court appointed counsel to represent 
Makekau, conducted a hearing, and denied Makekau's Rule 40 
Petition. The circuit court found that trial counsel was not 
informed of the December 2003 incident. 
Makekau raises six points of error on appeal, 
contending that: (1) FOF 20, 24, 25, 28 -37, 41-50 of the Order 
Denying Petition are clearly erroneous; (2) COL 11-14 of the 
Order Denying Petition are wrong because there is no fact or 
testimony in the record to support these conclusions; (3) the 
circuit court erred in concluding that the claim that trial 
counsel was ineffective for not calling an expert witness t o 
3   
 
 
  
 
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
rebut Dr. Schneider's testimony was meritless; (4) the circuit 
court erred in concluding that the claim that Makekau's 
appellate counsel was ineffective for not raising the 
ineffectiveness of trial counsel was meritless; (5) the circuit 
court erred by deny ing Makekau court -appointed counsel to assist 
him in preparing his HRPP Rule 40 Petition; and (6) the circuit 
court erred when trial counsel referred to "other notes" while 
testifying at the hearing on the Petition, and the circuit court 
did not order that the "other notes" be provided to Makekau or 
grant him a new hearing because the "other notes" were not 
provided to Makekau. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we 
resolve Makekau's points of error as follows. 
We review orders denying HRPP Rule 40 petitions de 
novo. Lewi v. State , 145 Hawaiʻi 333, 345, 452 P.3d 330, 342 
(2019). We review a "circuit court's conclusions of law de 
novo, and findings of fact for clear error." De La Garza v. 
State, 129 Hawaiʻi 429, 438, 302 P.3d 697, 706 (2013) ( cleaned 
up). We "may recognize plain error when the error committed 
affects substantial rights of the defendant." State v. 
Metcalfe , 129 Hawaiʻi 206, 22 2, 297 P.3d 1062, 10 78 (2013) 
(cleaned up ).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(1) "[A]n appellate court will not pass upon issues 
dependent upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight of 
the evidence; this is the province of the trier of fact." 
State v. Jenkins , 93 Hawaiʻi 87, 101, 997 P.2d 13, 27 (2000) 
(cleaned up ). Makekau fails to establish that the challenged 
FOFs are clearly erroneous. 
(2) In COL 11 -14, the circuit court concluded that 
Makekau had not established that trial counsel was ineffective 
for failing to present the December 2003 incident as part of 
Makekau's defense. The circuit court concluded that trial 
counsel was not inform ed of the December 2003 incident, and of 
the alleged witnesses to the incident. Trial counsel testified 
that he first learned of the December 2003 incident when he read 
Makekau's Rule 40 Petition and that, had he been informed of the 
December 2003 inciden t, he would have presented it for the 
defense. The circuit court found trial counsel credible with 
regard to his testimony that he was not informed of the December 
2003 incident, that Makekau's brother and his brother's 
girlfriend witnessed the December 2 003 incident, and that there 
was a hospital record of Makekau's visit to the emergency room 
on the date of the incident. Makekau's challenge to COL 11 -14 
lacks merit. 
(3) In State v. Richie , 88 Hawaiʻi 19, 39, 960 P.2d 
1227, 1247 (1998), the Hawaiʻi Supreme Court held that 
5   
 
 
  
  
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"[i]neffective assistance of counsel claims based on the failure 
to obtain witnesses must be supported by affidavits or sworn 
statements describing the testimony of the proffered witnesses." 
(Citations omitted). The circuit court properly applied Richie 
to this case. Because Makekau did not submit an affidavit or 
sworn statement describing the testimony of the rebuttal expert 
witness that he contends his trial counsel should have called, 
this point of error lacks merit. See State v. Jackson , No. 
CAAP-11-0000658, 2013 WL 1148393 (Haw. App. Mar . 19, 2013) 
(SDO). 
(4) Because Makekau did not meet his burden to 
establish that trial counsel was ineffective, Makekau's claim 
that appellate counsel was ineffective, for failure to raise the 
ineffectiveness of trial counsel, also lacks merit. 
(5) Makekau contends that HRPP Rule 40(i) provides for 
court-appointed counsel to represent indigent petitioners 
seeking post -conviction relief. HRPP Rule 40(i) specifically 
provides that "no such referral [to the public defender for 
representation] need be made if the petitioner's claim is 
patently frivolous and without trace of support either in the 
record or from other evidence submitted by the petitioner." 
Makekau did not present a colorable claim for relief until he 
submitted sworn statements of witn esses on August 21, 2017. 
Richie, 88 Hawaiʻi at 39, 960 P.2d at 1247. Therefore, the 
6   
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
circuit court did not err when it denied his request for counsel 
on July 18, 2017. The circuit court promptly appointed counsel 
to represent Makekau upon its determination that Makekau had 
presented a viable claim. 
(6) Makekau admits that no objection was made to the 
circuit court when trial counsel referred to "other notes" while 
testifying at the hearing on the Rule 40 Petition, and that the 
"other notes" are not part of the record. 
"As a general rule, if a party does not raise an 
argument at trial, that argument will be deemed to have been 
waived on appeal; this rule applies in both criminal and civil 
cases." State v. Moses , 102 Hawaiʻi 449, 456, 77 P.3d 940, 947 
(2003) (citations omitted). We find Makekau waived this point 
of error on appeal. 
Even if we were to address Makekau's arguments on the 
merits, it is not clear from the record that the "other notes" 
exist, and we find that the circuit court's failure to sua 
sponte order a new hearing regarding the "other notes" is not 
plain error. During the hearing on the Rule 40 Petition, trial 
counsel first used the term "other notes" in response to 
questions from the deputy prosecuting attorney about why he 
amended his witness list. Before that, trial counsel read for 
the circuit court his eight pages of handwritten case notes, 
which the parties had stipulated into evidence as Respondent's 
7   
 
 
  
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Exhibit 19. It is unclear whether trial counsel's use of the 
term "other notes" refers to notes that were not part of 
Respondent's Exhibit 19, or simply another page of notes 
included within Respondent's Exhibit 19. And assuming arguendo 
there exist "other notes" that are not included as part of 
Respondent's Exhibit 19, the failure of the circuit court to sua 
sponte order its production, or a new hearing regarding its non -
production, does not constitute plain error. 
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the circuit 
court's Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying 
Petitioner's Hawai ʻi Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 40 Petition 
for Post -Conviction Relief, entered on October 1, 2021, and the
