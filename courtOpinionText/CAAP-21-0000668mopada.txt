APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
(FC-D NO. 18-1-0355)  
MEMORANDUM OPINION 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Wadsworth and Guidry, JJ.) 
This case arises from the Family Court of the Second 
Circuit's (Family Court)  determination of child support and 
requests for post-decree relief in a divorce proceeding between 
self-represented Defendant-Appellant TC (Mother
) and Plaintiff-
Appellee WC (Father).  Mother appeals from orders entered by the 
Family Court denying her request to modify her visitation with 
the minor child (Child) of Mother and Father, awarding Father 
attorney's fees, and granting child support to Father.  21

2 In a prior appeal, WC v. TC, No. CAAP-21-0000410, 2022 WL 342944, *1
(Haw. App. Feb. 4, 2022), we dismissed Mother's appeal from the Family Court's
June 23, 2021 order, which had denied Mother's motion seeking unsupervisedvisitation and awarded Father attorney's fees. We dismissed on the basis that child support had not yet been decided and thus the Divorce Decree was not yetfinal as to child custody, visitation and support. Id.(citing Eaton v.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On appeal, Mother appears to contend that the Family 
Court erred by: (1) denying her request to modify supervised 
visitation; (2) awarding Father attorney's fees related to her request to modify visitation; (3) incorrectly calculating her child support obligation because her monthly income is $800; (4) violating her constitutionally protected parental rights by ordering her to pay child support; (5) discriminating against her; and (6) granting Father an extension of an Order for Protection (TRO) against Mother and allowing Father to use the 
TRO to alienate Mother from Child.
3 
For the reasons discussed below, we affirm in part and 
vacate in part. 
I. Brief Background 
On December 5, 2019, the Family Court entered a Decree 
Granting Absolute Divorce and Awarding Child Custody (Divorce Decree), awarding Father sole legal and physical custody of 
Child, with supervised visitation by Mother. The Divorce Decree 
reserved the issues of child support and property division. 
On May 19, 2021, Mother filed a Motion and Affidavit 
for Post-Decree Relief (Mother's 5/19/21 Motion) seeking, inter 
alia, unsupervised visitation with Child. On June 9, 2021, 
Father filed an opposition to Mother's 5/19/21 Motion arguing, inter alia, that in determining child custody, the Family Court 
Father's request for child support. 
Because child support has now been
decided, we also have jurisdiction to address Mother's challenges to the June
23, 2021 order denying unsupervised visitation and awarding Father attorney'sfees. 
3 Mother's opening brief does not comply with the requirements of
Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure ( HRAP) Rule 28, including that it does
not contain any record references as required by HRAP Rule 28(b)(3), and failsto set forth where in the record she objected to the Family Court's allegederrors or brought the errors to the court's attention as required by HRAP Rule28(b)(4). 
However, the Hawai #i Supreme Court instructs that pleadings
prepared by self-represented litigants should be interpreted liberally, andself-represented litigants should not be automatically foreclosed fromappellate review because they fail to comply with court rules. Erum v. Llego,
147 Hawai #i 368, 380-81, 465 P.3d 815, 827-28 (2020). Therefore, we address
Mother's points and arguments to the extent they can be discerned and we areable to address them.

previously found Mother committed family violence,4 and Mother 
failed to show a change in circumstances such that unsupervised 
visitation is in the best interest of the child. Father also requested attorney's fees incurred related to Mother's 5/19/21 Motion. 
After a hearing on June 14, 2021, the Family Court 
entered an "Order Denying [Mother's 5/19/21 Motion]" on June 23, 2021, denying Mother's request for unsupervised visitation. The Family Court also determined Mother's 5/19/21 Motion was frivolous and granted Father's request for attorney's fees and costs. On July 12, 2021, the Family Court entered an order awarding Father attorney's fees and costs in the amount of $4,103.90. 
On August 31, 2021, Father filed a Motion and Affidavit 
for Post-Decree Relief (Father's Motion), seeking a commencement 
of child support payments, enforcement of the attorney's fees 
award, and an order setting trial on property division. Mother did not file an opposition to Father's Motion. 
On October 7, 2021, Mother filed documents, titled as a 
"Certificate of Service," which included her Income and Expense Statement dated September 15, 2021 (9/15/21 Income Statement), 
and invoices related to her employment and supervised visitation. 
On October 11, 2021, the Family Court held a hearing on 
Father's Motion.

5 Mother has not provided the transcript of the October 11, 2021
hearing. See Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai #i 225, 230, 909 P.2d 553,
558 (1995) ("The burden is upon appellant in an appeal to show error by
reference to matters in the record, and he or she has the responsibility ofproviding an adequate transcript." (brackets and citation omitted)). 
We are 
thus hampered in our review related to Father's Motion. We attempt to addressMother's contentions to the extent possible. 
Although Mother attached a purported transcript for the October 11, 2021
hearing to her notice of appeal, she did not order a transcript pursuant toHRAP Rule 10(b), and the transcript does not comport with HRAP Rule10(b)(1)(G), which requires the court reporter to file transcripts in theappeal. See HRAP Rule 10(b)(1)(G) ("Upon completion of each transcript and
receipt of payment, the court reporter shall file the transcript through JEFSor JIMS[.]"). 
We are unable to consider the transcript submitted by Mother.

  II. Discussion NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the Order Granting Child Support ordering Mother to provide $429 
per month in child support to Father commencing from the date of Father's Motion. On December 29, 2021, the Family Court entered Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law (FOFs/COLs). In its 
FOFs/COLs, the Family Court determined that based on Mother's 
Income and Expense Statement signed on May 17, 2021, her gross monthly income is $3,626.
6 
On April 6, 2023, Mother filed a "Statement of Case" 
(4/6/23 Motion) in this appeal which appears to be a motion 
requesting modification of the Family Court's visitation order in 
the Divorce Decree. We address Mother's 4/6/23 Motion below.
A. Visitation
 Mother contends the Family Court erred in denying her 
request to modify supervised visitation in Mother's 5/19/21 Motion. On appeal, Mother essentially argues that visitation should have been changed because she complied with the Family Court's orders by completing a psychological and drug evaluation. In support of Mother's 5/19/21 Motion, Mother attested that she also took parenting classes, was currently taking anger management classes, and was working with a therapist. 
"Generally, the family court possesses wide discretion 
in making its decisions and those decisions will not be set aside

14. The Court finds the child support guideline amount of 
$429.00 per month is based on [Father's] gross monthly
income of $3,792.00 and [Mother's] gross monthly income of
$3,626.00. 
15. The Court finds that [Mother's] income was determinedfrom her Income and Expense Statement that she signed on May17, 2021 and attached to her May 19, 2021 Motion and 
Affidavit for Post Decree Relief. Based on her income of $2,426.00 and additional income of $1,200.00, her grossmonthly income totaled $3,626.00.

unless there is a manifest abuse of discretion." Kakinami v. 
Kakinami, 127 Hawai# i 126, 136, 276 P.3d 695, 705 (2012). The 
family court's COLs are reviewed on appeal de novo
, under the 
right/wrong standard. Id. 
On August 17, 2021, the Family Court entered Findings 
of Fact and Conclusions of Law (8/17/21 FOFs/COLs) in support of 
the Order Denying Mother's 5/19/21 Motion. Mother does not make 
any discernible argument challenging the Family Court's findings of fact or conclusions of law.
7 
The Family Court found, inter alia, that in a separate 
case involving the parties in FC-DA No. 18-1-0361, the Family Court issued a two-year TRO against Mother that expired on July 27, 2020; the court in FC-DA No. 18-1-0361 found Mother's conduct included psychological abuse which constituted family violence under the definition of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 571-2 
(2018);
8 the TRO was extended to July 27, 2021; and in the 
instant case, after a trial on July 31, 2019, the Family Court 
determined that awarding sole legal and physical custody to Father was in the best interest of Child.
9 Mother also does not 
contest the Family Court's findings that, based on the credible evidence at the July 31, 2019 trial, Mother had leaped off a second-story balcony, slashed Father with a sharp object 
7 Unchallenged findings of fact are binding on appeal. In re Doe, 99
Hawai #i 522, 538, 57 P.3d 447, 463 (2002). 
8 HRS § 571-2 provides, in pertinent part: 
"Family violence" means the occurrence of one or more
of the following acts by a family or household member, but
does not include acts of self-defense: 
(1) Attempting to cause or causing physical harm to
another family or household member;
(2) Placing a family or household member in fear of
physical harm . . . .

the TRO was issued and during the trial in this case on July 31, 2019. 
The Honorable Douglas J. Sameshima presided in FC-DA No. 18-1-0361 when
the TRO was extended on June 26, 2020.

requiring stitches and leaving Father with scars, and operated 
and crashed a vehicle while Father and Child were occupants. 
The Family Court ultimately determined that, 
notwithstanding the exhibits and arguments in support of Mother's 5/19/21 Motion, Mother's request for unsupervised visits with Child was not in Child's best interests. 
Given the record, the Family Court did not abuse its 
discretion in denying Mother's request for unsupervised visitation. 
B. Award of Attorney's Fees to Father 
Mother argues the Family Court erred in granting Father 
attorney's fees related to Mother's 5/19/21 Motion. 
The Hawai# i Supreme Court has explained that "an award 
of attorney's fees is in the sound discretion of the trial court, limited only by the standard that it be fair and reasonable." Hamilton v. Hamilton, 138 Hawai# i 185, 209, 378 P.3d 901, 925 
(2016) (quoting Farias v. Farias, 58 Haw. 227, 233, 566 P.2d 1104, 1109 (1977)). 
As explained above, the Family Court entered the 
8/17/21 FOFs/COLs in support of the Order Denying Mother's 5/19/21 Motion. In the 8/17/21 FOFs/COLs, the Family Court cites two grounds for granting Father's request for attorney's fees: relying on HRS § 580-47(f) (2018);
10 and also determining that 
10 HRS § 580-47(f) provides, in pertinent part, 
The court hearing any motion for orders either revising . .
. an order for the support and maintenance of one party bythe other, or a motion for an order to enforce any suchorder or any order made under subsection (a) of thissection, may make such orders requiring either party to payor contribute to the payment of the attorney's fees, costs,and expenses of the other party relating to such motion andhearing as shall appear just and equitable afterconsideration of the respective merits of the parties, therelative abilities of the parties, the economic condition ofeach party at the time of the hearing, the burdens imposedupon either party for the benefit of the children of theparties, the concealment of or failure to disclose income oran asset, or violation of a restraining order issued undersection 580-10(a) or (b), if any, by either party, and allother circumstances of the case. 
(Emphasis added.) 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Mother's 5/19/21 Motion was frivolous under Doe v. Doe, 118 
Hawai#i 268, 285, 188 P.3d 782, 799 (App. 2008). In Doe, this 
court vacated an award of attorney's fees to a father, where the family court had determined that the mother's actions had been frivolous. We noted that HRS § 607-14.5 requires a finding "in writing that all or a portion of the claims or defenses made by the party are frivolous and are not reasonably supported by the facts and the law in the civil action." Doe, 118 Hawai# i at 285, 
188 P.3d at 799 (quoting HRS § 607-14.5(b) (2016)). 
We also 
noted case law holding that a frivolous claim is a claim "so manifestly and palpably without merit, so as to indicate bad faith on [the pleader's] part such that argument to the court was not required." Id. (citations and internal quotation marks 
omitted). 
In Doe, notwithstanding the family court's 
determination that the mother's actions were frivolous, we held the record did not show that she acted in bad faith. Id. 
In this case, the Family Court found, inter alia, that 
Mother unilaterally stopped requesting visits with Child after January 27, 2021; Father first attempted to resolve the issues Mother raised in her motion, including unsupervised visitation, without involving the Family Court; despite Father's efforts to resolve these issues, Mother insisted on proceeding with a hearing before reasonable efforts to settle these issues were concluded; and Mother's 5/19/21 Motion was frivolous. The Family Court also determined that Mother was previously warned by the Family Court on December 20, 2019, "if there are any more motions and it is considered a frivolous motion, the court agrees that attorney's fees and costs shall issue at that time." 
The Family Court found Mother's 5/19/21 Motion was 
frivolous, but did not make specific findings that Mother's claims were not reasonably supported by the facts and the law. Moreover, there is no evidence in the record that Mother's 5/19/21 Motion was "so manifestly and palpably without merit, so as to indicate bad faith on the pleader's part such that argument 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to the court was not required." Tagupa v. VIPDesk, 135 Hawai# i 
468, 479-80, 353 P.3d 1010, 1021-22 (2015) (brackets and citation 
omitted) (explaining that "[a] finding of frivolousness is a high bar; it is not enough that a claim be without merit, there must be a showing of bad faith."). 
Although we have concluded that the Family Court did 
not abuse its discretion in denying Mother's request for unsupervised visits with Child, the record does not support a finding that her motion was frivolous. In support of her motion, Mother attested that supervised visits were becoming cost prohibitive, she had been seeing and working with a therapist for eight months, she had completed an online parenting course, and also recently began anger management classes. Mother also attached, inter alia, a letter dated May 10, 2021, from licensed clinical psychologist, Giulietta Swenson, Psy.D. (Dr. Swenson). 
Dr. Swenson stated, inter alia, that Mother initiated therapy in 
October 2020 and attended eleven sessions; Mother is timely to sessions and actively engaged in her treatment; in Dr. Swenson's clinical opinion, Mother is stable to move in the direction of unsupervised visits with Child; Mother has not exhibited any suicidal ideation or safety risks during Dr. Swenson's treatment of Mother; and Mother has been transparent in treatment and understands the impact of her actions on Child. 
To the extent the Family Court relied on HRS § 580-
47(f) to award attorney's fees and costs to Father, the court should have addressed the economic condition of the parties. Mother had attested that supervised visits with Child were becoming cost-prohibitive, and that she agreed with Dr. Swenson's recommendation of a "step-down" program leading to unsupervised visits except Mother did not have funds for a Guardian Ad Litem or a parent coordinator. Dr. Swenson's letter also noted that Mother's visits with Child had stalled due to the cost. There is no indication the Family Court considered the economic conditions of the parties in awarding Father his requested attorney's fees and costs in the amount of $4,103.90. 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
We thus conclude the Family Court abused its discretion 
in granting Father's request for attorney's fees.11 
C.  Child Support 
Mother contends the Family Court erred in calculating 
her child support obligation because her 9/15/21 Income Statement 
shows she earns $800 per month. Mother argues that based on her 9/15/21 Income Statement, the "child support order amount was over 70% of mothers [sic] [net] income and child support was not based off the Child Support guidelines."
12 We disagree. 
In determining child support, the Family Court 
considered the child support guideline worksheet Father submitted in support of Father's Motion. Based on Mother's Income and Expense Statement dated May 17, 2021, and Father's Income and Expense Statement dated June 28, 2021, Father calculated Child's support needs and the parties' support obligations. Mother did not provide a child support guideline worksheet and did not challenge Father's worksheet when she submitted her 9/15/21 Income Statement. 
Although Mother argues that her 9/15/21 Income 
Statement reflects she earns $800 per month, we agree with Father that Mother's calculation of her monthly income is incorrect. Based on her 9/15/21 Income Statement, it appears that Mother's gross monthly income for September 2021, includes $1,115 in gross monthly income from her part time job, $2,200 in rent relief from Catholic Charities Hawaii, and $400 per week ($1,600 per month) in assistance from her father, which totals $4,915. 
11 We note that on February 14, 2023, the Family Court denied Father's
request for enforcement of the July 12, 2021 order and judgment awarding
attorney's fees. 
12 Mother also argues that Father's income statement did not include
his rental income and improperly included expenses for his girlfriend and herfour children. As asserted by Father, Mother failed to raise this argument inthe Family Court. Thus, Mother has waived this argument by raising it for thefirst time on appeal. Waldecker v. O'Scanlon, 137 Hawai #i 460, 466-67, 375
P.3d 239, 245-46 (2016) (citing Ass'n of Apt. Owners of Wailea Elua v. WaileaResort Co., 100 Hawai #i 97, 107, 58 P.3d 608, 618 (2002) ("Legal issues not
raised in the trial court are ordinarily deemed waived on appeal.")). 
9  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Moreover, the Family Court based its child support 
ruling on Mother's Income and Expense Statement dated May 17, 
2021, in which Mother's gross monthly income totaled $3,626.00, which is lower than the amount Mother reported in her 9/15/21 
Income Statement. Further, Mother's argument that the child support order was over 70% of her net income is likewise without merit because $429 is not 70% of Mother's net income. As asserted by Father, the Child Support Guidelines Table of Incomes provides that given Mother's gross income of $3,626, her net income was $1,735. Thus, Mother fails to show that the Family Court erred in determining her income or in calculating her child support obligation. 
Mother argues for the first time on appeal that the 
Family Court violated her constitutionally protected parental rights by ordering her to pay child support. Because she did not raise this issue below, Mother has waived this argument. Waldecker, 137 Hawai# i at 466-67, 375 P.3d at 245-46. 
With regard to Mother's contention that the Family 
Court discriminated against her, Mother fails to provide any argument. Other than disagreeing with the Family Court's decisions, Mother fails to explain how the Family Court discriminated against her or how the court erred. Therefore, we need not address this contention. See HRAP Rule 28(b)(7) 
("Points not argued may be deemed waived.").
D. Temporary Restraining Order 
Mother contends the Family Court erred in granting 
Father an extension of a TRO against her and allowing Father to use the TRO to alienate Mother from Child. Mother fails to adequately identify the TRO she challenges. There does not appear to be a TRO in this case. Rather, Mother appears to address issues she raised in FC-DA NO. 18-1-0361 and in her appeal in that case, WC v. TC, NO. CAAP-21-0000411, 2022 WL 2841693 (Haw. App. July 21, 2022). 
Hence, Mother's arguments relating to a TRO are not 
properly before us in this appeal and we do not address them. 
10 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
E. Mother's Motion to This Court for Visitation 
Finally, we address the motion Mother filed in this 
appeal. In her 4/6/23 Motion, Mother asserts she requested a 
change to visitation and custody in the Family Court on February 8, 2023, while this appeal was pending.
13 After a hearing on 
March 6, 2023, the Family Court determined it lacked jurisdiction while this appeal was pending and entered the "Order Denying [Mother's] Motion for Post-Decree Relief" denying Mother's request.
14 
Mother does not seek review of the Family Court's 
order, but instead appears to request that we modify the Family Court's Divorce Decree directly. Mother fails to cite to any statute, court rule, or authority for this Court to directly modify a Family Court's visitation ruling and we find none. Further, the Family Court's ruling on Mother's February 8, 2023 Motion is not properly before us and we lack appellate jurisdiction to address that ruling in this appeal.
III. Conclusion 
Based on the foregoing, the Family Court of the Second 
Circuit erred in awarding Father attorney's fees and costs. Thus, the "Order Denying Defendant's May 19, 2021 Motion and Affidavit for Post-Decree Relief" entered by the Family Court on June 23, 2021, is vacated to the extent it awarded attorney's fees and costs to Father, and affirmed in all other respects. The "Order and Judgment in Favor of [Father] and Against [Mother] for Attorney's Fees and Costs" entered on July 12, 2021, is vacated. 
The "Order Granting In-Part Plaintiff's August 31, 2021 
Motion and Affidavit for Post-Decree Relief" entered on November 12, 2021, and the "Amended Order Re: Plaintiff's August 31, 2021 
13 Mother requested her visitation be changed from supervised to
unsupervised and also requested that custody of Child change from Father to
Mother because Father's "behavior has shown his negligent maliciousinterference with the mother and child relationship."

11 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Motion and Affidavit for Post-Decree Relief" entered on February 
14, 2023, are affirmed. 
Finally, Mother's "Statement of Case" filed on April 6, 
2023, which we construe as a motion to modify the "Decree Granting Absolute Divorce and Awarding Child Custody" entered by the Family Court on December 5, 2019, is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
