Boyle; and Anita Matsuzaki's [(Plaintiffs )] Motion for 
Reconsideration of Intermediate Court of Appeals December 23, 
2024 Summary Disposition Order" ( Motion for Reconsideration ), 
filed on January 2, 2025, it appears that: 
(1) Plaintiffs move for reconsideration of the court's 
Summary Disposition Order, filed on December 23, 2024; and  
(2) The Motion for Reconsideration presents no point 
of law or fact that this court overlooked or misapprehended.   
See  1
Hawaiʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 40(b).  
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion for 
Reconsideration is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawaiʻi,  January  13, 2025.

1 We note that the Hawaiʻi Supreme Court's decision in Noel Madamba 
Contracting LLC v. Romero , 137 Hawaiʻi 1, 364 P.3d 518 (2015), was decided 
four years before this court issued its memorandum opinion in PL III, LLC v. 
Puu Lani Ranch Corp. , No. CAAP -14-0001115, 2019 WL 2281 269 (mem. op.) (Haw. 
App. May 29, 2019) (the First Appeal ), and the "new facts" recited in Madamba 
about Judge Yim's relationship with Cades Schutte could and should have been 
raised by motion for supplemental briefing before the First Appeal was 
decided or, at the latest, by a motion for reconsideration – asking this 
court to expand the scope of the m andate on remand – after our memorandum 
opinion in the First Appeal was entered.
