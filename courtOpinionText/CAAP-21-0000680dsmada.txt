APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 1CCV-20-00001454) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, McCullen and Chan, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, we lack appellate 
jurisdiction over Complainant-Appellee/Appellant Hawaii 
Firefighters Association, IAFF, Local 1463, AFL-CIO's (HFFA
) 
appeal from the "effective nullification" by operation of Hawai# i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 4(a)(3) (2016) of its 
post-judgment Motion for Attorney's Fees and Costs (Motion for 
Fees) by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court) 
because no event has triggered the thirty-day time period for 
filing a notice of appeal pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) and (3). 
The Circuit Court's July 26, 2021 Final Judgment is an 
appealable final judgment pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (2016), 
Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Rule 58, and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & 
Wright, 76 Hawai# i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
Pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(3), the thirty-day time 
period for filing a notice of appeal under HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) was extended when HFAA timely filed the August 6, 2021 Motion for Attorney's Fees and Costs (Motion for Fees) within fourteen days 
after entry of the Final Judgment, as required by HRCP 
Rule 54(d)(2)(B). The Motion for Fees invoked the following tolling provision in HRAP Rule 4(a)(3): 
(3) Time to appeal affected by post-judgment
motions. If any party files a timely motion for
judgment as a matter of law, to amend findings or makeadditional findings, for a new trial, to reconsider,alter or amend the judgment or order, or forattorney's fees or costs, and court or agency rulesspecify the time by which the motion shall be filed,then the time for filing the notice of appeal isextended for all parties until 30 days after entry ofan order disposing of the motion. The presiding courtor agency in which the motion was filed shall disposeof any such post-judgment motion by entering an orderupon the record within 90 days after the date themotion was filed. If the court or agency fails toenter an order on the record, then, within 5 daysafter the 90th day, the clerk of the relevant court oragency shall notify the parties that, by operation ofthis Rule, the post-judgment motion is denied and thatany orders entered thereafter shall be a nullity. The time of appeal shall run from the date of entry of thecourt or agency's order disposing of the post-judgmentmotion, if the order is entered within the 90 days, orfrom the filing date of the clerk's notice to theparties that the post-judgment motion is deniedpursuant to the operation of the Rule. 
The notice of appeal shall be deemed to appeal
the disposition of all post-judgment motions that aretimely filed after entry of the judgment or order. 
The ninetieth day after HFFA filed the Motion for Fees 
was November 5, 2021. To date, the Circuit Court has not entered 
an order disposing of the motion, and the Circuit Court Clerk has not filed the notice required by HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). 
In Sanchez v. Sanchez, No. CAAP-17-0000407, 2021 WL 
4777103, at *5 (App. Oct. 13, 2021) (SDO), we noted that, under HRAP Rule 4(a)(3), 
the deemed denial [of a post-judgment motion] and the
nullification of future orders stem not just from thetrial court's failure to timely take action, but fromtwo steps: (1) the trial court's failure to enter anorder disposing of a timely-filed post-judgmenttolling motion; and (2) the clerk of the court's 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 notification to the parties that the post-judgment
motion is deemed denied by operation of the rule andthat any orders entered thereafter shall be a nullity. 
Id. (emphasis added). We further noted that "HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) 
does not contemplate this dual failure of both the court and the court's clerk to execute the requirements of the rule," but interpreting HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) to automatically deem a post-judgment motion as being denied 90 days after it was filed would "render[] superfluous the requirement that the clerk provide notice to the parties of the deemed denial." Id. at *8. 
Accordingly, we held that the trial court did not lack jurisdiction to enter an order granting the motion, outside the 90-day deadline. Id. 
Based on the above, the Circuit Court here retains 
jurisdiction to enter an order disposing of the Motion for Fees, and until it does so, or the clerk enters a notice that the Motion for Fees is denied by operation of HRAP Rule 4(a)(3), no event has triggered the thirty-day time period for filing a notice of appeal under HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) and (3). Therefore, the HFFA's December 3, 2021 Notice of Appeal is premature as to a disposition of the Motion for Fees. 
In situations where the record on appeal indicates that 
all claims against all parties have been resolved and the only event lacking for the perfection of an aggrieved party's right to appeal is the entry of the final judgment, we will invoke HRS § 602–57(3) (2016), and temporarily remand the matter for entry of a final judgment. Waikiki v. Ho# omaka Village Association of 
Apartment Owners, 140 Hawai# i 197, 398 P.3d 786 (2017); see also, 
State v. Joshua, No. SCWC–16–0000800, 2017 WL 4586328, at *1 (Haw. Oct. 16, 2017). However, the circumstances of the instant case are distinguishable from those in Waikiki and Joshua because the record on appeal does not indicate that the Circuit Court has expressed its final decision regarding the Motion for Fees; absent an appealable final post-judgment order, we lack appellate jurisdiction, and the appeal is premature. See L.D. v. T.G., 
No. CAAP-17-0000615, 2017 WL 6438546, at *3 (App. Dec. 18, 2017)

Jurisdiction and Dismissing Appeal for Lack of Appellate Jurisdiction).

IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that the appellate court 
clerk shall transmit a copy of this order to the Circuit Court Clerk.
