Complaint Filed on September 23, 2011 Pursuant to [ Hawaiʻi Rules 
of Civil Procedure ( HRCP)] Rule 41(a)(2) " (Order), filed on 
November 5, 2021 by the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit 
(Circuit Court ). 1 
I. BACKGROUND 
This appeal arises out of a foreclosure complaint (the 
Complaint ) brought by OneWest Bank, F .S.B. (OneWest Bank), on 
September 23, 2011, against the AOAO and Brown , among others . 
The Complaint alleged that Brown had defaulted on a $548,000 
note and mortgage assigned to OneWest Bank that covered Brown's 
interest in the Property . 
The AOAO filed its Answer to the Complaint on 
October 21, 2011, in which it asserted, as its Third Affirmative 
Defense, 
5. Hawaii Revised Statutes § 514B -146(a) gives to 
[the AOAO] a lien for all sums assessed b ut unpaid for the 
share of common expenses chargeable to the subject 
[P]roperty. This lien is superior and has priority over 
all other liens except for liens for taxes and assessments 
lawfully imposed by governmental authority against the 
subject [P]roperty and all sums unpaid on any mortgage of 
record that was recorded prior to the recordation of a 
Notice of Lien by [the AOAO]. [The AOAO's] Notice of Lien 
was recorded on January 28, 2008. 
The AOAO did not serve Brown with its Answer, nor did it file 
its own foreclosure complaint .

In July 2013, OneWest Bank moved, inter alia, for  
summary judgment against the AOAO, and for an order for an 
interlocutory decree of foreclosure.   The Circuit Court granted 
the motion, and entered judgment  and Findings of Fact ( FOF) and 
Conclusions of Law (COL)  in favor of OneWest Bank.   The Circuit 
Court foreclosed on the mortgage,  appointed a commissioner to 
take possession of the Property and to sell it, and reserved 
jurisdiction to determine the party or parties to whom any 
surplus shall be awarded.    
Two public auctions were held. At the first auction, 
in August 2014, the Property was sold to a third -party buyer for 
$50,000 subject to confirmation by the Circuit Court. The 
Circuit Court granted OneWest Bank's motion to re -open bidding, 
and a second auction was held. The Property this time was sold 
to OneWest Bank, as the highest bidder, for $ 815,098.42 , and 
that sale was confirmed by the Circuit Court. The Circuit Court 
ordered OneWest Bank to close on the sale within 35 days from 
the filing of the con firmation order – i.e., by April 10, 2015.2 
OneWest Bank failed to comply with the Circuit Court's 
deadline for closing the sale , and the AOAO filed a motion 
2 The Circuit Court ordered that, upon closing, the proceeds of the 
Property would be paid in the following order: (1) $2,062,24 to the 
Commissioner for services and expenses of the sale; (2) $ 581,972.26  to the 
Plaintiff in satisfaction of Plaintiff's debt; (3) $ 116,011. 95 to the AOAO 
for outstanding maintenance fees, master dues, and associated legal fees;(4) 
the remainder of the proceeds of sale and rental to the escrow for closing of 
the sale; and (5) any amount remaining in escrow after closing of the sale to 
Brown.

requesting that OneWest  Bank  be ordered to pay damages to the 
AOAO.   OneWest  Bank  in turn moved  the Circuit Court, inter alia, 
to vacate the  order confirming the sale of the Property to 
OneWest  Bank, and to instruct  the commissioner to conduct a new 
auction.   The AOAO and Brown opposed OneWest  Bank's motion. The 
Circuit Court entered orders denying  OneWest  Bank's motion and 
awarded  damages to the AOAO.    
OneWest  Bank  appealed. On appeal, this court vacated 
the Circuit Court's award of damages to the AOAO, concluding 
that the issue of OneWest Bank's liability for damages was not 
properly before the Circuit Court.   On certiorari, the Hawaiʻi 
Supreme Court (Supreme Court)  held that, while  "[t]he [C]ircuit 
[C]ourt was acting within its discretion when it held OneWest  
[Bank]  liable for its failure to close the foreclosure sale by 
the court-ordered deadline," the Circuit Court  abused its 
discretion in awarding damages to the AOAO. OneWest Bank, 
F.S.B. v. Ass'n of Owners of Kumulani at Uplands at Mauna Kea, 
146 Hawaiʻ i 105, 112, 456 P.3d 178, 185 (2020). The Supreme 
Court explained that "it would not be appropriate to award . . . 
damages to [the AOAO] based on Brown's underlying obligations to 
[the AOAO] to which OneWest  [Bank]  was not a party, particularly 
when OneWest  [Bank]  is the senior lienholder."   Id.  at 114, 456 
P.3d at 187.   The Supreme Court remanded to the Circuit Court 
for further proceedings  consistent with its opinion, i.e., "for 
4   
 
 
  
 
    
 
 
  
     
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
proper disposition of the [forfeited] down payment amount ," 
which was to be accomplished "by applying the amount to reduce 
Brown's debt as a penalty for [OneWest Bank's] failure to close 
the sale [.]" Id. 
On remand, Deutsche Bank National Trust Company as 
Trustee for Residential Asset Securitization Trust Series 2004 -
A9 Mortgage Pass -Through Certificates Series 2004 -I (Deutsche 
Bank) was substituted as a party for OneWest Bank. The AOAO 
moved the Circuit Court for relief, seeking, inter alia , for the 
Circuit Court to reopen bidding, and to authorize the sale of 
the Property to a named third-party bidder. Brown, joined by 
Deutsche Bank, moved pursuant to HRCP Rule 41(a)(2) for 
dismissal of the Complaint, on the basis that Brown paid the 
mortgage in full . 
The Circuit Court granted in part and denied in part 
the AOAO's motion for relief. The Circuit Court ruled, inter 
alia, that, 
(3) [The AOAO's] request that the Mortgaged 
Property be sold to James and Mitzi MacCallum for an amount 
of $638,628.88 is denied. 
(4) [The AOAO's] request that sales proceeds be 
distributed as proposed in its Motion is denied without 
prejudice insofar as the sales price for the Mortgaged 
Property is not yet known and the Court has questions 
regarding amounts owed to various parties. 
(5) [Deutsche Bank' s] lien of $ 581,972.26  shall be 
[reduced by] $81,509.84  for a total lien amount of 
$500,462.42  in accordance with the Hawaii Supreme Court 
Opinion filed on January 9, 2020 in this matter.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(6) [The AOAO's] request that its lien be set at 
$218,085.27  as of April 1, 2020 is denied without prejudice 
as the Court has questions regarding the amounts owed to 
various parties and further litigation is necessary. 
(7) [The AOAO's] request that [ Deutsche Bank ] be 
ordered to pay $ 98,687.29  to [the AOAO] pursuant to the 
order filed on January 13, 2015, which ordered [ Deutsche 
Bank] to pay the [AOAO's] fees and dues commencing 
September 1, 2014 to the date of closing, is denied without 
prejudice as further litigation is necessary. 
 . . . . 
(9) The Mortgaged Property shall be sold at public 
auction according to Paragraphs 4 through 14 on pages 7 
through 11 of the [FOF and COL], . . . filed June 3, 2014. 
(Emphasis added.) 
The Circuit Court subsequently granted in part and 
denied in part Brown's motion to dismiss the Complaint, and 
provided in relevant part,  
(a) [Deutsche Bank's] Complaint filed herein on 
September 23, 2011 is dismissed without prejudice as to any 
legal recourse the [AOAO] may have against [Deutsche Bank] 
and/or [Brown] in connection with the [AOAO's] lien or any 
unpaid assessments, which may be asserted in a separate 
independent action.  
The Circuit Court's Minute Order, which the Circuit 
Court attached to and incorporated into its order dismissing the 
Complaint, explained, among other things, that "[a]llowing Brown 
to pay off her mortgage with [Deutsche] Bank and retain her 
[P]roperty and requiring [the AOAO] to pursue its cause of 
action independently of this case is the just and equitable 
result under the facts and circumstances of this case. 
Moreover, [the AOAO] cannot force [Deutsche] Bank to foreclose." 
This appeal followed.

II. POINTS OF ERROR 
The AOAO  raises  three  points of error on appeal, 
contending that  the Circuit Court erred in its conclusion that: 
(1) the AOAO did not assert a cross-claim;  (2)  the AOAO did not 
assert a counterclaim; and (3) it had jurisdiction and authority 
to dismiss the case in violation of its prior orders.    
Upon careful review of the record and relevant legal 
authorities, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve  the 
AOAO's  contentions  as follows:  
(1) We address the AOAO's points of error out of order 
to first resolve the question of whether the Circuit Court had "jurisdiction and authority to dismiss the case." See  Norris v. 
Six Flags Theme Parks, Inc., 102 
Hawaiʻi 203, 206, 74 P.3d 26, 29 
(2003) (noting "[t]he United States Supreme Court has said that 
jurisdiction generally must precede merits in dispositional 
order.") (cleaned up). "The existence of jurisdiction is a 
question of law [reviewed] de novo  under the right/wrong 
standard." Amantiad v. Odum, 90 Hawai ʻi 152, 158, 977 P.2d 160, 
166 (1999) (citation omitted).  
The record reflects that , following confirmation of 
the sale of the Property to OneWest Bank at public auction, 
OneWest Bank failed to close the sale . Further litigation 
ensued. The Circuit Court , finding that OneWest Bank had 
7   
 
 
   
     
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
defaulted on closing the sale , awarded damages to the AOAO. On 
appeal, the Supreme Court held that, while it was within the 
Circuit Court's discretion to order OneWest Bank to pay damages, 
the damages should go towards a reduction of its lien against 
Brown. The Supreme Court remanded the matter, instructing the 
Circuit Court to "apply[] the [damages] amount to reduce Brown's 
debt as a penalty for [OneWest Bank's] failure to close the 
sale[.]" OneWest, 146 Hawaiʻi at 114, 456 P.3d at 187. 
We conclude that, on remand, jurisdiction reverted to 
the Circuit Court , which sat as a court of equity over this 
foreclosure proceeding: 
Foreclosure is an equitable action. Courts of equity 
have the power to mold their decrees to conserve the 
equities of the parties under the circumstances of the 
case. A court sitting in equity in a foreclosure case has 
the plenary power to fashion a decree to conform to the 
equitable requirements of the situation. Whether and to 
what extent relief should be granted rests within the sound 
discretion of the court and will not be disturbed absent an 
abuse of such discretion. 
Peak Cap . Grp., LLC v. Perez , 141 Hawaiʻi 160, 172, 407 P.3d 116, 
128 (2017) (cleaned up). 
The Circuit Court had equitable authority to order 
another public auction for the sale of the Property . It also 
had authority to subsequently dismiss the Complaint upon Brown's 
satisfaction of her mortgage obligations in full. At the time 
it dismissed the Complaint, a third public auction was still 
pending, and Brown could therefore exercise her "common -law 
8   
 
 
       
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
right to cure [the] default." Santiago v. Tanaka , 137 Hawaiʻi 
137, 156-57, 366 P.3d 612, 63 1-32 (2016) ("Because equity abhors 
forfeitures, and regards and treats as done what ought to be 
done, it is typical in foreclosure cases that a right to cure a 
default and stop the foreclosure continues up to the day of the 
confirmation of the sale." (cleaned up). 
Therefore, t he AOAO's jurisdictional argument lacks 
merit. 
(2) The AOAO contends, as its second and third points 
of error,  that the Circuit Court erred in granting the motion to 
dismiss because the AOAO had a pending cross-claim  and 
counterclaim.   A trial court's ruling on a motion to dismiss is 
reviewed de novo, under the right/wrong standard. Wright v. 
Home Depot U.S.A., Inc., 111 Hawaiʻi 401, 406, 142 P.3d 265, 270 
(2006).   
Irrespective of whether the AOAO had a cognizable 
cross-claim and/or counterclaim, a point that is disputed by the 
parties, the record reflects that there were no surplus proceeds 
against which the AOAO could assert a cross -claim or 
counterclaim f ollowing Brown's full satisfaction of her mortgage 
obligations. 
The decree of foreclosure in a mortgage foreclosure 
action extinguishes the liens of junior lienors who are 
parties. Defenses to the foreclosure complaint are 
required to be pleaded by such junior lienor defendants and 
are adjudicated by the decree of for eclosure. The claims of 
such junior lienors to any surplus remaining after 
9   
 
 
  
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
satisfaction of the senior mortgage, on the other hand, are 
to be pleaded as pure cross claims pursuant to HRCP Rule 
13(g). Unless there is a surplus after satisfying the 
mortgage debt, these cross claims have only academic 
significance. 
Powers v. Ellis , 56 Haw. 587, 588, 545 P.2d 1173, 1174 (1976) 
(cleaned up) (emphasis added). 
The Circuit Court was therefore not wrong in 
concluding that the AOAO "claimed a right to 'any surplus of the 
proceeds. ' . . . So, even if a valid claim had been asserted by 
[the AOAO] sufficient to argue against dismissal, . . . there 
are no surplus proceeds against which such a hypothetical claim 
could be asserted in this matter." 
Therefore, w e conclude that the Circuit Court did not 
err in granting Brown's motion to dismiss. 
III. CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Circuit 
Court's Order.
