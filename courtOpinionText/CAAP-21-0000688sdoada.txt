v. 
EVELIN ITURBIDE, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CRIMINAL NO. 1CPC-18-0000280) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: 
Ginoza, Chief Judge, Hiraoka and Chan, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Evelin Iturbide
 appeals from the 
"Judgment of Conviction and Sentence" entered by the Circuit 
Court of the First Circuit on November 15, 2021.1 For the 
reasons explained below, we vacate the Judgment and remand for a 
new trial. 
A grand jury indicted Iturbide for Murder in the Second 
Degree, for intentionally or knowingly causing the death of her husband, Juan Iturbide. After a jury trial, Iturbide was 
convicted of the included offense of Reckless Manslaughter. 
Iturbide was sentenced to 20 years in prison. The Judgment was entered on November 15, 2021. This appeal followed. 
Iturbide raises four points of error. One is 
dispositive.
2 She contends: 
1 The Honorable Paul B.K. Wong presided. 
2 We need not address Iturbide's contentions that the circuit court 
erred by denying her request to have the proposed jurors wear clear masks
(continued...) 2(...continued)NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The circuit court erred in refusing the evidence of
Jessica[ Estrada]'s infidelity and the burglary because the
evidence was admissible as probative of heruntrustworthiness and credibility pursuant to [Hawaii Rulesof Evidence] 608 and 609.1. The circuit court's errors constituted reversible error because Jessica's credibility,as a percipient witness, was critical to the State's caseand conflicted with [Iturbide]'s testimony and her defense.The evidence was also crucial because Jessica's testimonyhad changed a number of times and the bases for herinconsistencies were at issue. The errors cannot be considered harmless as there is a reasonable possibilitythat it contributed to [Iturbide]'s conviction.[Iturbide]'s rights to due process and fair trial wereviolated, and her conviction must be vacated. U.S. Const. amend. V, VI, and XIV; Haw. Const. art. I, §§ 5, 14. 
The incident that resulted in Juan's death took place 
in the Iturbides' apartment. A friend of the Iturbides, Jessica 
Estrada, was in the apartment and witnessed the incident. There 
were no other eyewitnesses. 
Iturbide filed a notice of intent to introduce evidence 
of other crimes, wrongs, or acts involving Jessica. The notice stated, in relevant part: 
9. The credibility of State witness, Jessica
Estrada, will also be at issue during the trial. Therefore,
Defense will also seek to introduce the following evidenceof other crimes, wrongs or acts of Ms. Estrada as specificinstances of untruthfulness and/or for the purpose ofestablishing her motive, bias, interest and/or intent: 
a. Ms. Estrada was cheating on her husbandwith a man named Julio. Julio was in the Marines. Ms. Estrada gave him thenickname "Cookie" in her phone to hide theaffair from her husband. 
b. Ms. Estrada admitted to [Iturbide] that she had cheated on her husband with another individual. 
. . . . 
e. On February 22, 2018, Ms. Estrada brokeinto [Iturbide]'s residence . . . . 
She 
also took property from the home (the samedate as her fourth statement to HPD detectives). 
The State filed a motion in limine to preclude Iturbide 
from questioning Jessica about the alleged extramarital affair 
during jury selection, allowing rebuttal testimony by two witnesses, anddenying Iturbide's motion for mistrial. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and the alleged burglary. The motion was heard on March 2, 2020. 
The circuit court precluded Iturbide from eliciting evidence of Jessica's affair with Julio/Cookie and the burglary, stating: 
The Court doesn't find infidelity to be probative  here. And 
after reviewing Rule 608, 609 and 609.1, the Court doesn't
find this to be admissible on the rules -- under the rules. Nor would infidelity be probative . And the prejudicial
value on this side trial as to Ms. Estrada's extramarital affairs would confuse the jury. So under all of those rules the Court denies the use of what's in paragraphs 9(a) and9(b). 
. . . . 
The Court's going to disallow the alleged burglary onFebruary 25th [sic], 2018, during Ms. Estrada's -- or at anytime. 
Whether or not she did or did not commit that 
particular offense is not relevant here. That kind of bad 
act again is controlled by Rule 608, 609 and 609.1. After 
review of all of those rules, the Court doesn't find anavenue of admissibility for that bad act . And it is highly
prejudicial and will be kept out. 
(Emphasis added.) A written order was entered on August 17, 
2021. 
The circuit court's rulings characterizing the 
proffered cross-examination not being probative of truthfulness, see, e.g., United States v. Ulloa, 942 F. Supp. 2d 202, 207 (D. N.H. 2013) (holding that under Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 608(b) marital infidelity is not probative of character for truthfulness), aff'd, 760 F.3d 113 (1st Cir. 2014),
3 or being 
"[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or [bad] acts" not admissible under Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rules 404(b) and 
403, was not error. 
We disagree, however, with the circuit court's ruling 
that the proffered cross-examination was not probative of bias, 
interest, or motive under HRE 609.1(a). 
The sixth amendment to the United States Constitution 
and article I, section 14 of the Hawai #i Constitution 
guarantees an accused the right to confront adverse
witnesses. Indeed, the main and essential purpose of 
3 "Although cases interpreting provisions in the Federal Rules of
Evidence are of course not binding on us, we may refer to them for theirpersuasive authority in interpreting similar provisions of the Hawaii Rules ofEvidence." State v. Davis, 140 Hawai #i 252, 258 n.14, 400 P.3d 453, 459 n.14
(2017) (citing State v. Jhun, 83 Hawai #i 472, 478, 927 P.2d 1355, 1361
(1996)). 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
confrontation is to secure for the opponent the opportunity
of cross-examination, and the exposure of a witness's
motivation in testifying is a proper and important functionof the constitutionally protected right of crossexamination . Additionally, [HRE] Rule 609.1(a) (2016)
provides that the "credibility of a witness may be attackedby evidence of bias, interest, or motive." This court has established that bias, interest, or motive is always
relevant under HRE Rule 609.1 . 
State v. Miranda, 147 Hawai# i 171, 179, 465 P.3d 618, 626 (2020) 
(cleaned up) (emphasis added). 
In Miranda, the supreme court discussed State v. 
Balisbisana, 83 Hawai# i 109, 924 P.2d 1215 (1996), State v. 
Marcos, 106 Hawai# i 116, 102 P.3d 360 (2004), State v. Levell, 
128 Hawai# i 34, 282 P.3d 576 (2012), and State v. Acacio, 140 
Hawai# i 92, 398 P.3d 681 (2017), and summarized: 
These cases demonstrate that the appropriate inquiry
when reviewing an alleged violation of a defendant'sconstitutionally protected right to demonstrate bias ormotive is whether the trier of fact had sufficient 
information, including as to its source, from which to makean informed appraisal of the witness's potential motive andbias . Once the defendant is afforded the threshold level of 
inquiry under the confrontation clause , the trial court may
conduct a balancing test to weigh the probative value of anyadditional motive evidence against its potential for undueprejudice. 
147 Hawai# i at 180, 465 P.3d at 627 (cleaned up) (emphasis 
added). 
As to Jessica's alleged extramarital affair with a 
Marine named Julio/Cookie, or Jessica's alleged admission to 
Iturbide that [Jessica] had cheated on her husband, we note that the circuit court denied the State's motion in limine to precludeIturbide from cross-examining Jessica about "having an affair and/or inappropriate relationship with Mr. Iturbide." 
The court 
stated: "9(d)[ ] comes in under 609.1. [Jessica] arguably has an 
interest in the outcome of the case. And therefore it affects her bias."
  54 
4 Item 9(d) of Iturbide's notice of intent stated: "[Jessica] was
having an affair and/or inappropriate relationship with Mr. [Juan] Iturbide." 
5 During the trial Iturbide did not cross-examine Jessica about an
alleged affair with Juan. 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
We note that Juan was a cook in the Marine Corps. The 
circuit court should have conducted the threshold level of 
inquiry into whether the trier of fact would have had sufficient information from which to make an informed appraisal of Jessica's potential motive and bias without cross-examination on items 9(a) and 9(b) — in other words, whether Julio/Cookie was actually Juan. The circuit court could then, if necessary, have balanced whether the probative value of Jessica's bias, interest, or motive under HRE 609.1(a) was "substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence" under HRE Rule 403. See Miranda, 147 Hawai# i at 180, 465 P.3d at 627; 
Balisbisana, 83 Hawai# i at 114, 924 P.2d at 1220 (citing HRE Rule 
403). 
As to Jessica's alleged burglary of the Iturbides' 
apartment four days after the stabbing, Levell is instructive. The defendant in that case was charged with harassment for allegedly shoving the complaining witness. The defendant was not permitted to cross-examine the complaining witness about whether she had stolen and used his credit cards. The supreme court held that the defendant's constitutional right to confront the complaining witness had been violated. 128 Hawai# i at 40, 282 
P.3d at 582. 
The supreme court 
explained that if the defendant had been allowed to ask
about the alleged theft, he might have elicited testimonytending to show that the complainant was biased or motivatedto fabricate or exaggerate a story about harassment, whichmay have affected the trial court's view of thecomplainant's testimony and, ultimately, whether the Statehad proven its case. 
Miranda, 147 Hawai# i at 180, 465 P.3d at 627 (citing Levell, 128 
Hawai# i at 40, 282 P.3d at 582). 
Similarly, in this case the circuit court should have 
conducted the threshold level of inquiry to determine whether the 
trier of fact would have had sufficient information from which to make an informed appraisal of Jessica's potential motive and bias without cross-examination about the alleged burglary. The 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
circuit court could then, if necessary, have balanced whether the 
probative value of Jessica's bias, interest, or motive under HRE 609.1(a) was "substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence" under HRE Rule 403. See 
Miranda, 147 Hawai# i at 180, 465 P.3d at 627; Balisbisana, 83 
Hawai# i at 114, 924 P.2d at 1220 (citing HRE Rule 403). 
Based on the foregoing, we vacate the "Judgment of 
Conviction and Sentence" entered by the circuit court on November 15, 2021, and remand for a new trial.
