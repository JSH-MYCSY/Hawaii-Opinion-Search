APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD 
(CASE NO. AB NO. 2018-161(M); DCD NO. 7-17-00457) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Acting C.J., and Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
This appeal stems from a dispute concerning attorneys' 
fees. Real Parties in Interest-Appellants Lowell K.Y. Chun-Hoon 
(Chun-Hoon) and Eve L.Y. Yeung (Yeung) (together, Appellants), 
who are attorneys with the law firm King, Nakamura & Chun-Hoon 
(KNCH), represented Claimant-Appellee-Appellee Elvira C. Chiang 
(Chiang) in the underlying workers' compensation proceeding. 
Appellants appeal from the July 19, 2021 Attorney's Fee Approval 
and Order (Order) and the November 18, 2021 Supplemental 
Attorney's Fee Approval and Order (Supplemental Order) entered by 
the Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board (LIRAB). 
Together, the Order and the Supplemental Order awarded KNCH 
attorneys' fees and costs, plus tax, in the sum of $25,764.39 for   
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
legal services performed by Chun-Hoon, Yeung, and KNCH attorney 
Rosalyn G. Payen (Payen).1/ 
On June 22, 2018, the Director of the Department of 
Labor and Industrial Relations (Director) entered a decision 
which determined that Employer-Appellant-Appellee The Ritz-
Carlton Hotel Company, LLC (Employer) was liable for Chiang's 
medical care after March 5, 2018, awarded Chiang temporary total 
disability benefits, and reserved matters of permanent disability and/or disfigurement for future determination (6/22/18 Decision). 
On July 10, 2018, Employer and Insurance Carrier-Appellant-
Appellee Marriot Claims Services appealed from the 6/22/18 Decision to LIRAB. The parties reached a settlement agreement, which LIRAB approved and entered on May 31, 2021 (Settlement). 
The Settlement provided in part that each party would bear its 
own attorneys' fees and costs, and those for Chiang's attorneys were subject to LIRAB's approval. 
On May 13, 2021, Chun-Hoon, Yeung, Payen, and Goods 
filed requests for approval of attorneys' fees pursuant to HRS § 386-94.
2/ On July 19, 2021, LIRAB entered the Order, which 
granted in part and denied in part the fee requests. On July 28, 2021, KNHC moved for reconsideration of the Order (Motion for 
Reconsideration). On November 18, 2021, LIRAB entered the 
Supplemental Order, which granted in part and denied in part the 
Motion for Reconsideration. 
On appeal, Appellants contend that LIRAB made various 
legal and factual errors, as detailed below, in the Order and the Supplemental Order, which improperly reduced the fees awarded to KNCH. 
After reviewing the record on appeal and the relevant 
legal authorities, and giving due consideration to the issues raised and the arguments advanced by the parties, we resolve Appellants' contentions as follows. 
1/ No fees were awarded for services provided by KNCH attorney K.
U#ilani Goods ( Goods). 
2/ HRS § 386-94 (Supp. 2020) states in part that an attorney's
"[c]laims for services shall not be valid unless approved by the [D]irector
or, if an appeal is had, by the appeals board or court deciding the appeal."

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
(1) Appellants challenge the following part of LIRAB's 
analysis in the Order: 
[LIRAB] did not approve the following tasks, because they
are clerical (non-legal) functions that are capable of beingperformed by support staff, for which no professional legalskills or analysis is required. 
KNCH contends that LIRAB erred: (a) "as a matter of law when it 
held that tasks of non-legal functions that did not require professional legal skill or analysis, were clerical"; and (b) "in finding as fact that attorneys had access to support staff." 
It is well settled that "[c]ourts should reduce an 
award of attorney's fees for . . . performance of clerical functions." Schefke v. Reliable Collection Agency, Ltd., 96 
Hawai#i 408, 458, 32 P.3d 52, 102 (2001); see Kaleikini v. 
Yoshioka, 129 Hawai# i 454, 469, 304 P.3d 252, 267 (2013) ("a 
review of Kaleikini's request does not indicate that any of the requested fees are . . . clerical"). LIRAB did not err as a matter of law in describing clerical functions.
3/ Furthermore, 
LIRAB's reference to "support staff" did not amount to a factual finding that "attorneys had access to support staff." Appellants' contention is without merit. 
(2) Appellants challenge the following part of LIRAB's 
analysis in the Order: 
Chun-Hoon's fee request is reduced by 0.1 hour for services
performed on March 15, 2021 because forwarding an email tohis client is not a legal service. 
KNCH contends that "[LIRAB] clearly erred in finding as a fact 
that . . . Chun-Hoon's March 15, 2021 billing entry was clerical when the entry explicitly included an e-mail to [Chiang] with a settlement authorization, which constituted legal services." 
Appellants' contention has merit. The time entry at 
issue, in context with surrounding entries, indicates that Chun-Hoon forwarded a settlement authorization letter to Chiang via email, i.e., he engaged in an attorney-client communication regarding a legal document. The evidence does not support 
3/ We do not read the challenged statement as equating paralegal
services with clerical services. See infra section (9). 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
LIRAB's conclusion that this was "not a legal service." LIRAB 
therefore abused its discretion in making this reduction. 
(3) Appellants challenge the following part of footnote 
3 in the Order: 
Attorney Payen's billing entries include billing: 1.0 hour
to draft a motion that was less than 2 pages of double-spaced text (4/20/19) . . . . 
Appellants contend that "[LIRAB] clearly erred in finding as fact 
that . . . Payen billed 1.0 hour to draft a motion on 4/20/19[,]" as "Payen did not have a billing entry dated 4/20/19." 
The challenged footnote is appended to the word 
"excessive" in the following sentence: "Although the time spent by Attorney Payen and Attorney Yeung on certain, specific legal services may seem excessive, consideration was given to their relative inexperience in workers' compensation law, their lower hourly rate, and the need to communicate with and take direction from Attorney Chun-Hoon to further [Chiang's] case." It does not appear that LIRAB reduced the fee request based on the disputed entry. Any error in describing that entry was therefore harmless. 
(4) Appellants challenge the following part of the 
analysis in the Order: 
Attorney Payen's fee request is reduced by 2.5 hours
because scheduling appointments, organizing files, printing,
filing, downloading documents, and compiling attorneys' feesare not services which require professional legal skills oranalysis.

Appellants contend that LIRAB clearly erred in describing the 
identified billing entries, because the actual entries included additional descriptions of legal services. 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Having reviewed the actual entries, we conclude that 
Appellants' contention has merit. The time entries at issue 
describe various legal services, including attorney-client communications. The evidence does not support LIRAB's conclusion to the contrary. LIRAB therefore abused its discretion in making this reduction. 
(5) and (6) Appellants challenge the following part of 
the analysis in the Order: 
Attorney Yeung's fee request is reduced by 8.4 hours because
scheduling appointments, confirming scheduled appointments,organizing and assembling files, calendaring, filingdocuments, transmitting documents, discussing retainerconditions and office procedures with staff, and compilingattorneys' fees are not services which require professionallegal skills or analysis.

04/20/2021 organize settlement documents and
materials 0.40 
(Original ellipsis and footnotes omitted.) Appellants contend 
that LIRAB clearly erred in finding that the identified billing entries described clerical work, because the entries included attorney-client communications regarding legal documents or hearing and legal document preparation, which constitute legal services. 
Appellants' contention has merit. Several of the 
billing entries at issue describe attorney-client communications regarding legal documents (e.g., 11/11/2020, 02/01/2021, 03/04/2021, 03/08/2021, 03/17/2021, 03/19/2021), which constitute legal services. LIRAB abused is discretion in reducing the requested fees for these services. See supra. Other entries 
that describe the organization and assembly of documents for hearing and settlement purposes also appear to constitute legal services, albeit those that might commonly be performed by a paralegal. See infra part (9). LIRAB abused its discretion in 
reducing the requested fees for these services. 
(7) Appellants challenge the following part of the 
analysis in the Order: 
While on appeal, this case presented no novel issues
and appears to be of average complexity. The parties
addressed issues which included but are not limited to issues surrounding [Chiang's] entitlement to medical care,TTD benefits, permanent disability, and vocationalrehabilitation. 
Appellants contend that LIRAB clearly erred in finding that this 
case presented no novel issues and was of average complexity. 
When mixed questions of law and fact are presented, an
appellate court must give deference to the agency'sexpertise and experience in the particular field. Dole 
Hawai #i Division–Castle & Cooke, Inc. v. Ramil, 71 Haw. 419,
424, 794 P.2d 1115, 1118 (1990). "[T]he court should notsubstitute its own judgment for that of the agency." Id. 
(citing Camara v. Agsalud, 67 Haw. 212, 216, 685 P.2d 794,797 (1984)). 
Igawa v. Koa House Restaurant , 97 Hawai#i 402, 406, 38 P.3d 570, 
574 (2001) (quoting 
In re Water Use Permit Applications
, 94 
Hawai#i 97, 119, 9 P.3d 409, 431 (2000)). 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Appellants argue generally that "[t]he unique 
combination of legal issues presented by the appeal also 
presented a novel combination of issues of greater than average complexity in the workers' compensation area." They do not explain specifically how this case presented novel or complex issues. On this record, we defer to LIRAB's judgment regarding the relative complexity of the underlying case. 
(8) Appellants challenge the following part of the 
analysis in the Order: 
Duplicative billings by an attorney will be reduced by
[LIRAB]. Duplicative billings and billings for interofficecommunications, even among separate billers, effectivelyincrease the expense. Thus, where Attorney Chun-Hoon,Attorney Payen, Attorney Yeung, and Attorney Goods billedfor time spent communicating with each other or billed forthe same legal services (e.g., reviewing a document,attending the same conference), the time billed by thehighest billing attorney (Attorney Chun-Hoon) was allowed,the time billing by the lower billing attorneys (AttorneyPayen, Attorney Yeung, and Attorney Goods) was reduced. 
Appellants contend that "[LIRAB] erred as a matter of law in 
holding that concurrent billing by more than one attorney is not recoverable." 
In Fought & Co. v. Steel Eng'g & Erection, Inc.
, 87 
Hawai#i 37, 951 P.2d 487 (1998), the Hawai# i Supreme Court 
disallowed charges sought by Fought's general counsel that it found were "duplicative of charges also claimed by Fought's Hawai#i counsel" and appeared unreasonable under the 
circumstances presented there. 
Id.
 at 56, 951 P.2d at 506; see 
also Schefke
, 96 Hawai#i at 458, 32 P.3d 52 at 102 ("[c]ourts 
should reduce an award of attorney's fees for . . . duplicative efforts by the attorney and paralegal"). Accordingly, it is within LIRAB's statutory authority to reduce requested attorney's fees where more than one attorney in the same firm bills for the same task, if it concludes that such fees are not reasonable under the circumstances. 
See
 HRS 386-94 ("[I]n all cases, 
reasonable attorney's fees shall be awarded."(emphasis added)). 
Here, it does not appear that LIRAB ruled categorically 
that "concurrent billing by more than one attorney is not recoverable." Rather, it concluded that specific legal services provided by Payen, Yeung, and Goods were duplicative of the same 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
services provided by Chun-Hoon. LIRAB did not abuse its 
discretion in so ruling. 
(9) Appellants challenge the following part of the 
Supplemental Order: 
Attorney Chun-Hoon contended that attorney activities that
were deducted from the fee requests because they wereconsidered to be clerical in nature should be allowed as paralegal time. This argument is not credited because theindividuals who performed the deducted activities were notparalegals. They were fully licensed attorneys. Moreover,simply labeling a task as paralegal work does not alter itsclerical nature or transform it into a proper, billableactivity. The disallowed activities were administrative in nature and should be part of Attorney Chun-Hoon's overheadexpenses rather than passed on to Claimant. 
Appellants contend that "[LIRAB] erred as a matter of law in 
denying paralegal time for non-legal duties performed by attorneys." They do not specify the "paralegal time" at issue. 
"[I]f reasonable compensation requires it, a prevailing 
party must be compensated for paralegal costs." Schefke
, 96 
Hawaii # at 458, 32 P.3d at 102; 
see Blair v. Ing
, 96 Hawai#i 327, 
334, 31 P.3d 184, 191 (2001) ("in appropriate cases, a request or award of attorneys' fees may include compensation for separately billed legal services performed by a paralegal, legal assistant, or law clerk" (emphasis omitted)). Here, KNHC submitted a declaration by Chun-Hoon, which stated in part: "The limited experience of Ms. Payen and Ms. Yeung is reflected in their $125.00/hourly rate, which is, in my opinion, an extremely low hourly rate for attorney time, and a rate more appropriate for a moderately experienced paralegal." In these circumstances, LIRAB should have considered compensating KNHC for "paralegal work" performed by attorneys. 
It appears, however, that the only affected billing 
entries are those discussed above, in parts (5) and (6), which describe the organization and assembly of documents for hearing and settlement purposes. 
We concluded that LIRAB abused its 
discretion in reducing the requested fees for these services. Appellants do not identify any other specific entries related to their point of error. 
For the reasons discussed above, we vacate the Order 
and the Supplemental Order in relevant part and remand this 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
matter to LIRAB to recalculate the award of attorneys' fees to 
KNCH in accordance with this summary disposition order.
