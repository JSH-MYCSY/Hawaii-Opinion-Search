IN THE MATTER OF THE ARBITRATION BETWEEN 
BRIAN S.I. KIM, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v. 
HICKAM COMMUNITIES LLC, Defendant-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1CSP-21-0000248) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka and McCullen, JJ.) 
Brian S.I. Kim
 appeals from the November 18, 2021 Order 
denying his motion to vacate an arbitration award and confirming 
the award, entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit.1 
We affirm. 
Hickam Communities LLC terminated Kim's employment in 
2013. Kim sued Hickam in 2014. Kim and Hickam had signed an agreement that required arbitration of any employment dispute. The parties stipulated to dismiss the lawsuit and arbitrate Kim's claims through Dispute Prevention & Resolution, Inc. ( DPR). They 
selected an arbitrator. A prearbitration conference call was set for January 6, 2016. Kim's attorney didn't call in because of a calendaring error. 
1 The Honorable James H. Ashford presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Nothing happened until May 31, 2019, when Kim's 
attorney emailed Hickam's attorney about the arbitration. 
Hickam's attorney didn't respond. 
On December 1, 2020, Kim's attorney emailed DPR to 
reschedule the arbitration. The neutral the parties had selected was no longer handling arbitrations, so the parties selected a replacement. 
Hickam moved to dismiss the arbitration on April 27, 
2021, based on laches and waiver. It argued "two key witnesses" were unavailable, and other witnesses' memories "will have inevitably faded" in the more than seven years since Kim's termination. Kim's opposition argued DPR had taken no action to reschedule the prearbitration conference, and Hickam should have reset it if Hickam was concerned about the passage of time. The arbitrator made an Award granting Hickam's motion to dismiss. 
The Award stated it was made "solely on the basis of waiver (and not on the basis of laches, because prejudice to defendant has not been sufficiently shown) due to the long period of no action by [Kim] to pursue arbitration." 
Kim moved to modify or correct the Award. He argued 
that DPR's Arbitration Rules let any party or the arbitrator call 
a conference, and required the arbitrator — not Kim — to set the hearing date. Kim's motion was denied. 
On September 14, 2021, Kim filed the special proceeding 
below by moving to vacate the Award. 
The circuit court entered 
the Order, which denied the motion to vacate and confirmed the Award, on November 18, 2021. This appeal followed. We review de novo. Tatibouet v. Ellsworth, 99 
Hawai#i 226, 233, 54 P.3d 397, 
404 (2002). 
Kim contends the circuit court erred by confirming the 
Award. 
Judicial review of an arbitration award is confined to 
the strictest possible limits, and a court may only vacate
an award on the grounds specified in [Hawaii RevisedStatutes ( HRS)] § 658A-23 and modify or correct on the 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
grounds specified in HRS § 658A-24. This standard applies
to both the circuit court and the appellate courts. 
In re Hawai #i State Teachers Association, 140 Hawai #i  381, 391, 
400 P.3d 582, 592 (2017) (cleaned up). 
Kim argues the arbitrator "refused to consider the 
evidence of the DPR Arbitration Rules[.]" A court may vacate an 
arbitration award if the arbitrator "refused to consider evidence material to the controversy . . . so as to prejudice substantially the rights of a party to the arbitration proceeding[.]" 
HRS § 658A-23(a)(3) (2016). Kim's argument is 
not persuasive. DPR's rules are not evidence. An arbitrator's misapplication of the law — or rules — is not a basis to vacate an award. See Nordic PCL Constr., Inc. v. LPIHGC, LLC, 136 
Hawai#i 29, 42, 358 P.3d 1, 14 (2015) (noting that "courts are 
powerless to correct an arbitrator's . . . rulings on the law, even if wrong"). 
Kim also argues the arbitrator "exceeded her powers" by 
"finding a waiver by [Kim] of his right to arbitration[.]" 
A 
court may vacate an arbitration award if the "arbitrator exceeded the arbitrator's powers[.]" HRS § 658A-23(a)(4). An arbitrator's power is determined by the arbitration agreement. Tatibouet, 99 
Hawai#i at 235, 54 P.3d at 406. DPR's arbitration 
agreement provided: 
Unless the parties' agreement provides otherwise, the 
Arbitrator  shall determine all issues submitted to 
arbitration by the parties and may grant any and all
remedies that the Arbitrator determines to be just and
appropriate under the law . 
(Emphasis added.) 
Kim doesn't argue that the Hickam arbitration agreement 
restricts the arbitrator from granting any remedy the arbitrator 
determines to be appropriate under the law. The arbitrator determined that dismissal based on waiver was an appropriate remedy under the law. The arbitrator acted within her power by making the Award. The circuit court could not properly have

vacated the Award even if it disagreed with the arbitrator's 
findings of fact or application of the law. Nordic, 136 Hawai#i 
at 42, 358 P.3d at 14. 
The November 18, 2021 "Order (1) Denying Plaintiff 
Brian S.I. Kim's Motion to Vacate Arbitration Award Dated June 16, 2021 (Filed Sept. 14, 2021, DKT 1) and (2) Confirming Arbitration Award Dated June 16, 2021" is affirmed.
