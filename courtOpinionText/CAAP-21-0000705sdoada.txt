FRANK E. WILSON, Defendant-Appellant,

APPEAL FROM THE  CIRCUIT  COURT OF THE FIRST  CIRCUIT  
(CASE NO. 1CPC-19-0001360)  
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Wadsworth and Guidry, JJ.)  
Defendant -Appellant Frank E. Wilson (Wilson), appeals 
from the "Order Denying [] Wilson's Motion to Dismiss for Lack

of Jurisdiction [,]" filed on March 2, 2020 ( Order)1 by the 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit ( circuit court ). 2 
Wilson raises a single point of error on appeal: 
"Whether the [circuit court] erred in denying [Wilson's] Motion 
to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction without considering, 
determining, and discussing in the Order whether Schofield 
Barracks was in fact a critical or vital area thus divesting the 
State of concurrent jurisdiction."  
Upon careful review of the record and relevant legal 
authorities , and having given due consideration to the arguments 
advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we conclude that 
Wilson's contention lacks merit. 
Wilson's jurisdictional argument, that the State of 
Hawaiʻi lacks concurrent jurisdiction to prosecute offenses 
committed at Schofield Barracks , raises a question of statutory 
interpretation. "Questions of statutory interpretation are 
questions of law reviewable de novo." Hawaii Gov 't Emps. Ass'n, 
1   The State charged Wilson by indictment with Computer Fraud in the 
First Degree, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS)  § 708-891(1)  
(2014) (Count 1), and Theft in the First Degree, in violation of HRS § §  708-
830.5(1)(a)  and § 708 -830(1)  (2014) ( Count 2). The circuit court dismissed 
both Counts 1 and 2 without prejudice. Wilson's appeal is timely taken from 
the circuit court's "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Granting 
[] Wilson's Motion for Reconsideration of the Denial of [] Wilson's Motion to 
Dismiss Counts 1 and 2 of the Indictment [,]" (FOF/COL/Order )  filed on 
November 19, 2021, which resulted in the dismissal of this case without 
prejudice.   See  State v. Nicol, 140 Hawai ʻi 482, 494 , 403 P.3d 259, 271  (2017) 
("HRS § 641- 11 authorizes a defendant's appeal in a criminal matter from a 
circuit court order dismissing the proceedings without prejudice").

AFSCME Loc . 152 v. Lingle, 124 Hawai ʻi 197, 201-02, 239 P.3d 1, 
5-6 (2010). 
In § 16(b) of the Hawaii Statehood Act, Congress 
established that the State would share concurrent jurisdiction 
with the federal government over lands in Hawai ʻi owned or 
controlled by the federal government at the time of Hawai ʻi's 
admission as a State.   Pub. L. No. 86-3, §  16(b) 73 Stat. 4, 11-
12 (1959).   Section 16(b) also, however, reserved to the federal 
government "sole and exclusive jurisdiction over such military 
installations as have  been  heretofore or hereafter determined to 
be critical areas  as delineated by the President of the United 
States and/or the Secretary of Defense." Id.  (emphasis added). 
Wilson contends that Schofield Barracks, as a military installation, is a "critical area," as contemplated in the 
Hawaii Statehood Act. In support of his contention, Wilson 
relies on  the President's  Executive Order No. 10104,  issued on 
February 1, 1950,  which defines, inter alia, "[a]ll military, 
naval, or air-force installations[,]" as "vital military and 
naval installations."  
In State v. Thomas , 8 Haw. App. 497, 504, 810 P.2d 
668, 671-72 (App. 1991), this court held that, 
the very last proviso in § 16(b) holds that if the 
President and/or Secretary of Defense determines that a 
military installation in this state is a "critical area," 
then the United States would have exclusive jurisdiction 
over the land within the installat ion. Again, we are not 
3

aware that such a determination has been made. Although 
there is some authority indicating that Pearl Harbor and 
its surrounding contiguous federal lands have been declared 
"vital" to the national defense of the country, we decline, 
without more, to hold that such a declaration is the 
equivalent of the  determination required in the last 
proviso of § 16(b) . See Silas Mason Co. v. Tax Comm'n , 302 
U.S. 186, 58 S.Ct. 233, 82 L.Ed. 187 (1937). Absent a concrete pronouncement by the federal government that it 
desires or requires exclusive jurisdiction over the land at 
Iroquois Point, we must give effect to the concurrent jurisdiction established by § 16(b).  
 
(emphasis added). 
Here, as in Thomas, we have not been made aware of any 
determination by the President and/or Secretary of Defense that  
Schofield Barracks  is  a "critical area" for purposes of  §  16(b). 
As in Thomas, we decline to hold that Executive Order No. 10104 
is the equivalent of such a determination. We must  therefore 
give effect to the concurrent jurisdiction established by §  
16(b).  
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Order, filed 
March 2, 2020 .
