JOSHUA PARTRIDGE, Defendant-Appellant. 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
WAILUKU DIVISION 
(CASE NO. 2DTC-21-601509) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: 
Leonard, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Joshua Partridge (P
artridge) 
appeals from the Judgment and Notice of Entry of Judgment entered 
on October 29, 2021 (Judgment), in the District Court of the 
Second Circuit, Wailuku Division (District Court).1 After a 
bench trial, Partridge was convicted of Excessive Speeding in 
violation of Hawai# i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291C-105(a)(1) or

(2) (2020)2 and sentenced in accordance with HRS § 291C-105(c)(2) 
(2020).3 
Partridge raises two points of error on appeal, 
contending that: (1) the District Court erred in denying his 
oral motion to dismiss the June 18, 2021 Amended Complaint where the charge failed to give him notice of the nature and cause of the accusation against him; and (2) his sentence for Excessive Speeding as a second conviction within five years under HRS § 291C-105(c)(2) must be vacated where there was no admissible evidence of a prior conviction. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve Partridge's points of error as follows: 
(1) Partridge contends the Excessive Speeding charge 
violated his constitutional rights to due process under the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States and article I, § 5 of the Constitution of the State of Hawai# i because the 
Amended Complaint failed to define the term "applicable state or county speed limit," which is separately defined in HRS § 291C-
2/ HRS § 291C-105(a) states: 
§ 291C-105   Excessive speeding . (a) No person shall
drive a motor vehicle at a speed exceeding: 
(1) The applicable state or county speed limit by
thirty miles per hour or more; or 
(2) Eighty miles per hour or more irrespective of
the applicable state or county speed limit. 
3/ HRS § 291C-105(c)(2) provides enhanced sentencing instructions for
"an offense that occurs within five years of a prior conviction for an offense 
under th[e same] section."

105(b),  and is an attendant circumstance of the offense. 
Partridge submits that by omitting the definition, Plaintiff-
Appellee State of Hawai# i (the State) failed to provide Partridge 
with fair notice of which state or county speed limit he was accused of exceeding.

"Whether a charge sets forth all the essential elements 
of a charged offense is a question of law, which we review under the de novo, or right/wrong, standard." State v. Mita, 124 
Hawai#i 385, 389, 245 P.3d 458, 462 (2010) (citation omitted; 
format altered). Here, the language in the Amended Complaint tracked the language of HRS § 291C-105(a)(1) and (c)(2), alleged that Partridge committed the offense of Excessive Speeding — as a second offense in five years — when he drove 77 miles-per-hour in a 45 mile-per-hour zone, and did so within five years of a prior conviction for the same offense. See State v. Garcia
, 152 
4/ Specifically, HRS § 291C-105(b) provides: 
(b) For the purposes of this section, "the applicable
state or county speed limit" means: 
(1) The maximum speed limit established by county
ordinance; 
(2) The maximum speed limit established by officialsigns placed by the director of transportationon highways under the director's jurisdiction;or 
(3) The maximum speed limit established pursuant tosection 291C-104 by the director oftransportation or the counties for school zonesand construction areas in their respectivejurisdictions. 
5/ Although Partridge arguably waived his argument concerning a defect
in the charge by not raising it in a pre-trial motion, see  
Hawai #i Rules of 
Penal Procedure Rule 12(b)(2), (f), the District Court impliedly grantedrelief from the waiver by considering the argument on the merits, withoutcomment on its timeliness. See State v. Przeradski, 5 Haw. App. 29, 31-32,
677 P.2d 471, 474-75 (1984). 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawai#i 3, 8, 518 P.3d 1153, 1158 (2022) ("Generally if a 
charging document tracks an offense's statutory language, then 
the State doesn't need to load it with definitions of words defined elsewhere."). The statutory definition of "applicable state or county speed limit" is consistent with its commonly understood meaning, i.e., the maximum speed permitted by law on a particular roadway. Moreover, the definition does not create an additional element of the offense, but merely describes three different ways the speed limit may be established. See Mita, 124 
Hawai#i at 392, 245 P.3d at 465 ("[T]he State need only allege 
the statutory definition of a term when it creates an additional essential element of the offense, and the term itself does not provide a person of common understanding with fair notice of that element."). 
Thus, we conclude that the charge did not deprive 
Partridge of due process. 
(2) Partridge contends that the District Court erred in 
admitting a driver's traffic abstract and a prior judgment for the same offense (both documents named Joshua Partridge and contained certain other identifying information), because the State failed to prove that Partridge was the same person named in those documents. 
On appeal, Partridge concedes that, in the 
District Court proceedings, he did not argue that the State failed to prove that Partridge was the person named in the documents. At no point in the proceedings below did Partridge contest that he was the person referenced in the State's exhibits. 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
We conclude that Partridge waived a challenge to the 
admissibility of the State's exhibits on the basis that they had 
not established that he was the same person named in those documents. See State v. Moses, 102 Hawai# i 449, 456, 77 P.3d 
940, 947 (2003) (arguments not raised at trial are waived on appeal); State v. Long, 98 Hawai# i 348, 353, 48 P.3d 595, 600 
(2002) ("[A] 'lack of foundation' objection generally is insufficient to preserve foundational issues for appeal because such an objection does not advise the trial court of the problems with the foundation."). 
For these reasons, the District Court's October 29, 
2021 Judgment is affirmed.
