(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
Upon  review  of  the  record,   it  appears  that: 
(1)  On  January  12,  2024,  the  court  ordered  that  within 
ten  days  from  the  order,  self-represented  Defendant-Appellant 
Julia  Compton  (Compton )  shall  show  cause  demonstrating  why  the 
appeal  should  not  be  dismissed  for  failure  to  file  a  first 
amended  opening  brief.   The  court  cautioned  Compton  that  failure 
to  timely  respond  to  the  order  or  to  show  good  cause  may  result 
in  sanctions,  including  dismissal  of  this  appeal;  and 
(2)  Compton  took   no  further  action  in  this  appeal. 
Therefore,  IT  IS  HEREBY  ORDERED  that  the  appeal  is 
dismissed.   Hawai i  Rules  of   Appellate  Procedure  Rule  30. 
DATED:   Honolulu,  Hawai i,  January   29,   2024.
