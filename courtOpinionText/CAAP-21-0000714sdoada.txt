(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Wadsworth and McCullen, JJ.) 
Self-represented Appellant-Appellant John E. Herzog

Strike); (2) December 3, 2021 "Order Affirming Employment

Notice of Entry of Judgment.  (Formatting altered.)  1
From June 25, 2018, to June 6, 2019, Herzog, a Hawai‘ i 
resident, worked for Virginia-based employer 
Dewberry & Davis, 
Inc. (and its subsidiary, Dewberry Engineers) assisting with disaster relief efforts in Puerto Rico. Dewberry "mobilized" 
Herzog as part of its contract with the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA) to provide disaster assistance. Prior 
to working for Dewberry, Herzog did not work for any other 
employers in 2018. 
On June 13, 2019, Herzog applied for unemployment 
benefits in Hawai‘i; his claim was denied "because of 
insufficient quarters and wages in base period." (Formatting altered.) Herzog appealed the benefits denial to the Employment Security Appeals Referees' Office (ESARO) on August 16, 2019. 
Following a hearing, ESARO affirmed the denial. Herzog then 
appealed to the circuit court, which affirmed ESARO's decision. 
Herzog appeals to this court, raising five points of 
error. 
Our review of "decision[s] made by the circuit court 
upon its review of an agency's decision is a secondary appeal."

forth in Hawai‘ i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 91-14(g) (2012 & 
Supp. 2016) to determine whether the circuit court's decision 
was right or wrong. Id. at 120-21, 424 P.3d at 475-76 
(citations omitted). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve this 
appeal as discussed below and affirm. 
(1) Herzog's first and fourth points of error are 
related. In his first point of error, Herzog contends the 
circuit court erred when it "erroneously found that [he] did not 
have wages and was not employed . . . by wrongly applying and concluding on waived law and facts upon the definition of 
'employment' in HRS 382-2(d) [(2015)] and by proxy concluding 
and relying upon HRS 383-29(a)(5)(C) [(2015)] and HAR 12-5-99." 
Herzog makes similar contentions in his fourth point of error.

ESARO determined that Herzog had "insufficient wages 
to establish a valid Hawaii claim for unemployment benefits 
pursuant to [HRS] § 383-29(a)(5)(C) based on a benefit year beginning June 9, 2019." The circuit court ruled there was no 
2 Although not a point of error raised, Herzog argues that there are 
other ways Hawai‘i residents should be paid benefits through interstate 
compact agreements. We deem this argument waived. Hawai‘i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure Rule 28(b)(4).

error in ESARO's conclusion based on HRS § 383-29(a)(5)(C) and 
that Herzog was not employed under HRS § 383-2(d). 
HRS § 383-29(a)(5)(C) provides for unemployment 
benefits where an individual was employed as defined in 
HRS § 383-2: 
(a) An unemployed individual shall be eligible to receive 
benefits with respect to any week only if the 
department finds that: 
 . . . . 
(5) In the case of an individual whose benefit year 
begins: 
 . . . . 
(C) After January 4, 1992, the individual has 
been employed, as defined in section 383-2 , 
and has been paid wages for insured work 
during the individual's base period in an 
amount equal to not less than twenty- six 
times the individual's weekly benefit amount, as determined under section 383-
22(b), and the individual has been paid wages for insured work during at least two 
quarters of the individual's base period; 
provided that no otherwise eligible 
individual who established a prior benefit 
year under this chapter or the unemployment compensation law of any other state, shall 
be eligible to receive benefits in a 
succeeding benefit year until, during the 
period following the beginning of the prior 
benefit year, that individual worked in covered employment for which wages were paid 
in an amount equal to at least five times 
the weekly benefit amount established for 
that individual in the succeeding benefit 
year. 
HRS § 383-29(a)(5)(C) (formatting altered; emphasis added). 
Relatedly, HRS § 383-2(d) provides, in part, that employment 
includes service performed within the United States if "[t]he service is not covered under the unemployment compensation law 
4   
 
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of any other state" and "[t]he place from which the service is 
directed or controlled is in this State." 
Here, Herzog testified that "all the 
employers/employees in Puerto Rico received day-to-day and 
ongoing direction of management from FEMA in Puerto Rico. They 
were under the absolute control of FEMA at all times, subjected 
to all of FEMA's employment conditions." Because Herzog's 
service was directed or controlled in Puerto Rico, and not 
Hawai‘i, he was not employed as defined by HRS § 383-2(d) to be 
eligible for benefits under HRS § 383-29(a)(5)(C). 
Thus, the circuit court did not err in affirming 
ESARO's determination that Herzog was ineligible for unemployment benefits in 
Hawai‘i. 
(2) Herzog's second and third points of error are 
also related. 
Herzog appears to contend his due process rights 
were violated because the circuit court refused "to strike 
Dkt. 26, pg. 59" and used this document in rendering its 
decision. The document at "Dkt. 26, pg. 59" is the Unemployment 
Insurance Division's Claim Summary. 
Due process "calls for such procedural protections as 
the particular situation demands" and requires "notice and an 
opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful 
manner." Casumpang v. ILWU Loc. 142
, 108 Hawai‘i 411, 423-24, 
5   
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
121 P.3d 391, 403-04 (2005) (internal quotation marks, citation, 
and brackets omitted). 
At the beginning of the ESARO hearing, the hearing 
officer asked Herzog if he reviewed the documents uploaded 
electronically for the hearing, and Herzog responded in the 
affirmative. The hearing officer then went through each 
exhibit, including the Claim Summary. After identifying the 
exhibits, the hearing officer asked, "Do you have any objection to the documents, Mr. Herzog?" Herzog replied, "No." With 
that, the hearing officer stated "the documents [were] being 
entered as part of the record." 
Because the hearing officer confirmed Herzog had 
examined the uploaded documents prior to the hearing and 
afforded Herzog ample opportunity to inspect, explain, and rebut 
documents entered into evidence, Herzog was not denied due 
process. 
(3)
 Herzog's final point of error challenges the 
circuit court's decision to not "sanction[] [ Hawaiʻi Department 
of Labor and Industrial Relations (DLIR)]/ESARO for their 
abusive delays, [and] the [deputy attorney general] for her 
intentional misrepresentations to the Court[.]" 
"A trial court's decision as to whether to impose 
sanctions is . . . 'due a substantial degree of deference,' and 
it will generally be upheld unless it 'exceeds the bounds of 
6   
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
reason, all of the circumstances before it being considered.'" 
Deutsche Bank Nat'l Tr. Co. v. Greenspon, 143 Hawai‘ i 237, 244-
45, 428 P.3d 749, 756-57 (2018) (citations omitted). 
The circuit court stated it did "not have a problem 
with [DLIR's] brief, at least in response to what Mr. Herzog 
[had] presented so far." The court "[found] adequate citations 
to the record. [It did] not see inaccurate or misleading 
citations." Nor did the court "find at this point that [DLIR] 
is misleading the court." 
We cannot say the court abused its discretion by 
declining to sanction DLIR/ESARO. 
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the circuit court's 
(1) September 20, 2021 Order Denying Motion to Strike; (2) December 3, 2021 Order; and (3) December 3, 2021 Final 
Judgment.
