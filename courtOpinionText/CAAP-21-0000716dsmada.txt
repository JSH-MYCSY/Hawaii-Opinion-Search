OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
FRANCISCO ALVARADO, JR., Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Respondent-Appellee. 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CASE NO. 1PR191000005; CR. NO. 1PC051001701)  
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Chan, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record it appears that: 
1. On April 16, 2020, the circuit court entered the 
order denying Petitioner-Appellant Francisco 
Alvarado, Jr.'s 
Hawai# i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40 Petition for 
Post-Conviction Relief that is the subject of this appeal; 
2. The 
Notice of Appeal was mailed from Saguaro 
Correctional Center in Eloy, Arizona, and deemed filed on December 21, 2021, see Setala v. J.C. Penney
, 97 Hawai# i 484, 40 
P.3d 886 (2002); 
3. Respondent-Appellee 
State of Hawai# i contested 
appellate jurisdiction on the grounds that Alvarado's notice of appeal was not filed within 30 days after entry of the order denying his HRPP Rule 40 Petition, as required by Hawai# i Rules 
of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 4(b)(1); 
4. On July 6, 2020, this court issued an order to 
show cause about appellate jurisdiction (
OSC); 
5. Alvarado did not respond to the OSC and the 
deadline to respond (extended at Alvarado's request) has passed; NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
6. The failure to file a timely notice of appeal is a 
jurisdictional defect that a court has no discretion to 
disregard. Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127, 
1129 (1986). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that no further action 
will be taken on the July 6, 2022 Order to Show Cause. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, October 21, 2022.
