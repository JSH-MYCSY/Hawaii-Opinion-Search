APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 3DV201000029) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and Chan, JJ.) 
Self-represented Plaintiff-Appellant MS (Mother) 
appeals from the "Decree Granting Absolute Divorce" (Divorce 
Decree) entered by the Family Court of the Third Circuit on 
November 9, 2021.1 For the reasons explained below, we affirm. 
Mother was married to Defendant-Appellee PP (Father). 
They have four minor Children. Mother filed for divorce in 2020. A trial was held. The family court entered findings of fact, 
conclusions of law, and a decision on September 27, 2021. The court decided (among other things): 
1 The Honorable Jeffrey A. Hawk presided.  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2. [Father] is awarded sole legal and physical
custody of the minor children, subject to Defendant's [sic]
rights of reasonable visitation as set forth above.[2] 
. . . . 
7. Counsel for [Mother] shall prepare a Divorce
Decree consistent with these findings, conclusions, anddecision. 
Then-counsel for Mother submitted a proposed divorce 
decree. Father filed objections and an alternative proposed 
divorce decree. The Divorce Decree was entered on November 9, 2021. The family court used Mother's form of the divorce decree, but made the following changes: 
3. Custody of Minor Children. 
a) Legal Custody. [Father] is awarded sole legal
custody of the minor children of the parties. [Father]
shall give [Mother] 30 days' advance notice prior to making
any major decision involving the children. JAH 
b) Physical custody. [Father] is awarded sole
physical custody of the minor children of the parties[.] 
c) For so long as any child is a minor, the
custodial parent shall keep the non-custodial parentinformed of the children's residence address. JAH 
The strikeouts were initialed by the family court judge. 
Mother, representing herself, filed a timely notice of 
appeal. She obtained an extension of time to file the opening 
brief, but failed to meet the extended deadline. Mother requested a second extension of time. We extended the deadline to May 9, 2022. Mother again failed to meet the deadline. A "Default of Opening Brief" was entered on May 10, 2022. Mother filed her opening brief on May 18, 2022, without first setting aside the default or obtaining another extension of time. 
2 The family court had previously concluded: 
10. Despite the anxiety of the children, the Court
concludes that Mother  shall be awarded visitation with the 
minor children as therapeutically driven by the children's
therapists. 
(Emphasis added.) 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Mother's opening brief did not comply with Hawai# i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (
HRAP) Rule 28(b), and was not signed by 
Mother (as required by HRAP Rule 32(d)).3 
(1) Father requests dismissal of Mother's appeal. 
However, the Hawai# i Supreme Court instructs that self-
represented litigants should not be foreclosed from appellate 
review "because of failure to conform to requirements of the procedural rules." Erum v. Llego, 147 Hawai# i 368, 381, 465 P.3d 
815, 828 (2020) (citing Morgan v. Plan. Dep't, Cnty. of Kauai, 104 Hawai# i 173, 180-81, 86 P.3d 982, 989-90 (2004)). Under the 
circumstances, we decline to dismiss Mother's appeal. 
We address 
Mother's arguments to the extent they can be discerned, because Hawai# i appellate courts have "consistently adhered to the policy 
of affording litigants the opportunity 'to have their cases heard on the merits, where possible.'" Morgan, 104 Hawai# i at 180-81, 
86 P.3d at 989-90 (citing O'Connor v. Diocese of Honolulu, 77 Hawai# i 383, 386, 885 P.2d 361, 364 (1994)).
(2) Mother argues that the family court violated her 
procedural and substantive due process rights by sua sponte striking provisions from sections 3(a) and 3(c) of her proposed divorce decree. After a trial, the family court entered findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a decision, and ordered that Mother's then-counsel submit a proposed divorce decree. 
Mother's 
former counsel complied. Father objected and filed his own proposed divorce decree. The family court accepted Mother's proposed decree, but struck provisions that were inconsistent with the family court's findings, conclusions, and decision. The family court was authorized to do so under Rule 23 of the Rules of the Circuit Courts of the State of Hawai# i. The family court 
did not violate Mother's procedural or substantive due process rights. 
3 Mother also filed a reply brief after the applicable deadline
without first obtaining an extension of time or leave for the late filing.
See HRAP Rule 28(d). 
3   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(3) Mother argues that the Divorce Decree improperly 
terminated her parental rights under Hawai# i Revised Statutes 
(
HRS) § 571-61. The proceeding below was not initiated by a 
verified petition filed pursuant to HRS § 571-61(b)(3).4 Mother 
initiated the proceeding by filing for a divorce. In divorce 
cases the family court is authorized to decide child custody, visitation, and support under HRS § 571-46. "Any custody award shall be subject to modification or change whenever the best interests of the child require or justify the modification or change[.]" HRS § 571-46(a)(6) (2018). The family court did not terminate Mother's parental rights.
(4) Mother argues that the family court erred by 
awarding sole legal and physical custody of Children to Father. 
[T]he family court possesses wide discretion in making its
decisions and those decision[s] will not be set aside unlessthere is a manifest abuse of discretion. Thus, we will notdisturb the family court's decisions on appeal unless thefamily court disregarded rules or principles of law orpractice to the substantial detriment of a party litigantand its decision clearly exceeded the bounds of reason. 
Fisher v. Fisher, 111 Hawai# i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 (2006) 
(citation omitted). 
HRS § 571-46 (2018) sets forth the criteria and 
procedure for awarding child custody and visitation. The family 
court must make a custody decision "according to the best interests of the child[.]" HRS § 571-46(a)(1). When determining what constitutes "the best interest of the child" the family court must consider the sixteen factors set forth in HRS § 571-46(b). No single factor is given presumptive weight. Fisher, 
4 HRS § 571-61(b)(3) (2018) provides, in relevant part: 
In respect to any proceedings under paragraphs (1) and (2),
the authority to terminate parental rights may be exercisedby the court only when a verified petition, substantially inthe form above prescribed, has been filed by someresponsible adult person on behalf of the child in thefamily court of the circuit in which the parent resides orthe child resides or was born and the court has conducted a hearing of the petition. 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
111 Hawai# i at 50, 137 P.3d at 364. The family court weighed all 
sixteen of the factors in this case in conclusion of law no. 8. 
The family court then concluded: 
9. Considering all of those factors, and the
evidence and arguments presented by the parties, the Court
concludes that Father has provided the bulk of the care forthe children for the past 19 months, that the care he hasprovided is nurturing and appropriate and that Father isbetter situated to continue to provide care for thechildren. Based on the testimony of the guardian ad litemin this case, it appears that the relationship with Motheris damaged and that the children cannot safely return toMother at this point. The Court further concludes that because of the level of conflict between the parties thebest interests of the children will be served by awardingFather sole legal and physical custody of the children. 
Conclusions of law nos. 8 and 9 actually present mixed 
questions of fact and law, which we review under the "clearly 
erroneous" standard because the family court's conclusions are dependent on the facts and circumstances of each individual case. Est. of Klink ex rel. Klink v. State, 113 Hawai# i 332, 351, 152 
P.3d 504, 523 (2007). 
A conclusion of law that is supported by 
the family court's findings of fact and reflects an application of the correct rule of law will not be overturned. Id.
Mother argues that the credibility of the witnesses and 
the evidence presented at trial should have been weighed in her favor, rather than in favor of Father. However, "it is not the province of the appellate court to reassess the credibility of witnesses or the weight of the evidence, as determined by the family court[.]" Fisher, 111 Hawai# i at 51, 137 P.3d at 365 
(citing In re Doe, 95 Hawai# i 183, 197, 20 P.3d 616, 630 (2001)). 
The family court's findings of fact were supported by substantial evidence, and are not clearly erroneous. 
The family court's 
conclusions of law reflect an application of the correct rule of law, HRS § 571-46(b). The family court did not err by awarding sole legal and physical custody of Children to Father.
(5) We decline to consider the arguments made for the 
first time in Mother's reply brief. In re Hawaiian Flour Mills, 
Inc., 76 Hawai# i 1, 14 n.5, 868 P.2d 419, 432 n.5 (1994) (holding 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that arguments raised for the first time in the reply brief on 
appeal were deemed waived). 
For the foregoing reasons, the "Decree Granting 
Absolute Divorce" entered by the family court on November 9, 2021, is affirmed.
