MARK FUKUDA, Plaintiff-Appellant, v. 
GEICO INSURANCE CORPORATION, Defendant-Appellee. 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 1CCV-21-0000390)  
  
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, McCullen and Guidry, JJ.) 
Self-represented Plaintiff-Appellant Mark Fukuda  
appeals from the Circuit Court of the First Circuit's June 27, 
2022 Final Judgment in favor of Defendant-Appellee Geico  
Insurance Corporation.

According to Fukuda's complaint, he was involved in a 
two-car accident in a parking lot. Fukuda and the other driver 
exchanged phone numbers and insurance information; both were

insured by Geico but Fukuda did not have collision coverage 
under his policy. A Geico representative determined that Fukuda 
"was half liable for the accident." Fukuda declined Geico's 
settlement and indicated he would sue instead. 
Fukuda filed a complaint naming Geico as the defendant 
and alleging (1) breach of contract, (2) breach of the implied 
covenant of good faith and fair dealing, (3) fraud, and 
(4) intentional infliction of emotional distress. 
Geico moved for summary judgment, which the circuit 
court granted. Fukuda appeals, asserting he was not allowed to amend his complaint.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve this 
appeal as discussed below, and vacate and remand. 
Fukuda contends the circuit court "erred in 
misrepresenting that I didn't have the right to amend the pleading as discussed at the hearing for the" motion for summary 
judgment. Fukuda argues that the circuit court "should have 
allowed for me to amend the pleading[,]" relying on Hawai‘ i Rules 
of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 14(a). 
2 Fukuda asserts a second point of error challenging the granting of 
summary judgment on his fraud claim. Based on our decision, we need not 
reach this point.

However, HRCP Rule 14(a) is inapplicable here because 
it applies when a "defendant may bring in [a] third-party" and 
Fukuda was the plaintiff – not the defendant - in the underlying 
case. (Emphasis omitted.) 
HRCP Rule 15(a)(1) explains, before trial, a party may 
amend a pleading "once as a matter of course at any time before 
a responsive pleading is served[.]" Otherwise, "a party may 
amend the party's pleading only by leave of court or by written consent of the adverse party; and leave shall be freely given 
when justice so requires. . . ." HRCP Rule 15(a)(2). 
The Hawai‘ i Supreme Court has held that "unless there 
is an apparent reason indicating otherwise, under HRCP 
Rule 15(a), leave to amend shall be freely given to a party to 
amend its complaint when justice so requires" and "undue delay 
alone is an insufficient basis for denying leave to amend a 
complaint[.]" Carvalho v. AIG Hawai‘ i Ins., 150 Hawai‘ i 381, 
385, 386, 502 P.3d 482, 486, 487 (2022) (citation omitted).

discretion standard." Id. at 384, 502 P.3d at 485 (citation 
omitted). And abuse of discretion occurs when the circuit court 
has "disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the 
substantial detriment of a party litigant." Id. (internal 
quotation marks and citations omitted). 
Here, Fukuda filed his complaint on March 26, 2021. 
Fukuda did not file an amended complaint before Geico filed its answer, and he does not cite to where in the record he requested leave to file an amended complaint before the December 9, 2021 
hearing on Geico's motion for summary judgment. 
During the December 9, 2021 hearing on Geico's motion 
for summary judgment, Fukuda and the circuit court discussed 
filing an amended complaint: 
THE COURT: . . . . My point is you seem to be 
arguing that [defense counsel] is blocking you from suing 
the insured because you don't have her address. You don't 
need her address to sue her. So that makes no sense. 
MR. FUKUDA: Okay. Well, now I'll do it to paper 
then. 
 . . . . 
MR
. FUKUDA: And I can still get the -- I can still 
get everything done. I can file for the first amended. I 
have that all written up already. I have everything written up. It's just that we had to sit here today so I 
decided just, you know, I mean, there's no sense to file 
all kinds of papers if there's a MSJ blocking it, I mean, possibly. 
(Emphases added.) 
The circuit court noted, "we've talked about you 
bringing a claim against the driver at the last hearing, so 
4   
 
  
 
   
  
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
nothing's happened since then." Fukuda then asserted, "I have 
it all written up. It's already ready. If you like proof, I 
can email it to you." The circuit court responded, "No. The 
point is what's in the record as of now." 
The circuit court orally granted Geico's motion at the 
end of the hearing. 
According to the docket list for the underlying case, 
the prior hearing was on November 2, 2021, about a month before the December 9, 2021 hearing on Geico's motion for summary 
judgment.
4 
Thus, it appears the circuit court relied on Fukuda's 
failure to file an amended complaint between the November 2, 
2021 and December 9, 2021 hearings in denying Fukuda leave to 
amend his complaint; in other words, the circuit court relied on 
undue delay. Applying the supreme court's determination that 
undue delay alone is insufficient to deny leave to amend a 
complaint, and taking into account Fukuda's self-represented status as well as the lack of information as to how the 
complaint would be amended, we hold the circuit court abused its 
discretion. See Carvalho, 150 Hawai‘ i at 386, 502 P.3d at 487. 
4 A transcript for the November 2, 2021 hearing is not part of the 
record on appeal. See Hawai‘i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure Rule 10(b)(1)(A) 
(providing that appellant must request transcripts when raising a point 
requiring "consideration of the oral proceedings before the court appealed 
from").

Because we remand this case, Fukuda is returned to the 
same position he was in before the alleged error occurred, which 
was before the circuit court granted Geico's motion for summary 
judgment. See Gurrobat v. HTH Corp.
, 135 Hawai‘i 128, 134, 346 
P.3d 197, 203 (2015) (citing 
Nelson v. Univ. of Hawai‘i
, 99 
Hawai‘i 262, 267, 54 P.3d 433, 438 (2002)). 
Based on the foregoing, we vacate the circuit court's 
January 7, 2022 order granting Geico's motion for summary 
judgment and June 27, 2022 Final Judgment. 
We remand this case 
to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with 
this summary disposition order.
