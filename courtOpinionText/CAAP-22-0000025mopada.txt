minor,  a  duty  imposed  by  law,  intending  or  knowing  that  the 
failure  to  seek  and  obtain  timely  medical  attention  would 
result  in  the  death  of  a  four  year  old  male  minor[.] 
A total of 30 days elapsed between May 30, 2012, and 
June 29, 2012, which are not excluded for Rule 48 purposes.3 
2 For  purposes  of  analyzing  whether  McKeown  was  entitled  to  relief 
pursuant  to  Hawaii  Rules  of  Penal  Procedure  (HRPP)  Rule  48  (Rule  48),  the 
calculation  of  time  begins  on  May  30,  2012.

Rule 48. Dismissal. 
   . . . . 
(c) Excluded Periods. The following periods shall be 
excluded in computing the time for trial commencement: 
(1) periods that delay the commencement of trial and 
are caused by collateral or other proceedings concerning the 
defendant, including but not limited to penal 
irresponsibility examinations and periods during which the 
defendant is incompetent to stand trial, pretrial motions, 
interlocutory appeals and trials of other charges; 
(2) periods that delay the commencement of trial and 
are caused by congestion of the trial docket when the 
congestion is attributable to exceptional circumstances; 
(3) periods that delay the commencement of trial and 
are caused by a continuance granted at the request or with 
the consent of the defendant or defendant's counsel;

McKeown's  trial  was  set  for  September  17,  2012.   A 
total  of  80  days  elapsed  from  June  29,  2012,  to  September  17, 
2012,  which  are  not  excluded  for  Rule  48  purposes.  
McKeown's  trial  in  case  number  2FC121000280  was 
continued  a  number  of  times  for  various  reasons  as  follows. 
On  August  16,  2012,  trial  was  continued  from 
September  17,  2012,  to  October  15,  2012,  on  McKeown's  request 
because  the  parties  were  still  working  on  discovery.   McKeown 
waived  his  Rule  48  rights  for  this  period.   A  total  of  28  days 
elapsed  between  September  17,  2012,  and  October  15,  2012,  which 
are  excluded  for  Rule  48  purposes.  
3(...continued) 
(4) periods that delay the commencement of trial and 
are caused by a continuance granted at the request of the 
prosecutor if: 
(i) the continuance is granted because of the 
unavailability of evidence material to the 
prosecution's case, when the prosecutor has 
exercised due diligence to obtain such evidence 
and there are reasonable grounds to believe that 
such evidence will be available at a later date; 
or 
(ii) the continuance is granted to allow the 
prosecutor additional time to prepare the 
prosecutor's case and additional time is 
justified because of the exceptional 
circumstances of the case; 
(5) periods that delay the commencement of trial and 
are caused by the absence or unavailability of the 
defendant; 
(6) the period between a dismissal of the charge by 
the prosecutor to the time of arrest or filing of a new 
charge, whichever is sooner, for the same offense or an 
offense required to be joined with that offense; 
(7) a reasonable period of delay when the defendant 
is joined for trial with a codefendant as to whom the time 
for trial has not run and there is good cause for not 
granting a severance; and 
(8) other periods of delay for good cause.

On  September  27,  2012,  trial  was  continued  to 
January  14,  2013,  on  McKeown's  request,  because  the  autopsy 
report  had  just  been  given  to  McKeown,  which  triggered  "a  lot  of 
other  work."   McKeown  waived  his  Rule  48  rights  for  this  period.    
On
 January 3, 2013, trial was continued to March 11, 
2013, to allow time for the Family Court to turn over medical 
records to the State and for the State to prepare a protective 
order. McKeown waived his Rule 48 rights for this period. 
On February 28, 2013, trial was continued to May 20, 
2013, and McKeown waived his Rule 48 rights for this period. 
On April 18, 2013, trial was continued to August 5, 
2013, on both parties' request, and McKeown waived his Rule 48 
rights for this period. A total of 294 days elapsed between 
October 15, 2012, and August 5, 2013, which are excluded for 
Rule 48 purposes. 
On July 11, 2013, trial was continued to September 5, 
2013, and McKeown waived his Rule 48 rights for this period.

for this time period. A total of 60 days elapsed between 
August 5, 2013, and October 4, 2013, which are excluded for 
Rule 48 purposes. 
On October 4, 2013, trial was continued to November 8, 
2013, on McKeown's request because McKeown was still waiting for 
records to turn over to his expert. McKeown waived his Rule 48 
rights for this period. A total of 35 days elapsed between 
October 4, 2013, and November 8, 2013, which are excluded for 
Rule 48 purposes.

On  November  8,  2013,  trial  was  continued  to 
November  21,  2013,  because  records  were  still  not  completed.   A 
total  of  13  days  elapsed  between  November  8,  2013,  and 
November  21,  2013,  and  the  Family  Court  found  that  it  was  unclear 
whether  this  time  period  was  excluded  or  included  under  Rule  48.  
However,  the  Family  Court  appears  to  have  included  this  period  in 
its  Rule  48  computation.  
On
 November 21, 2013, trial was continued to 
January 15, 2014, and McKeown waived his Rule 48 rights for this 
time period. 
On January 15, 2014, trial was continued to 
February 19, 2014, on McKeown's request because McKeown was 
waiting for the return of a subpoena duces tecum for records of 
about 400 pages. McKeown waived his Rule 48 rights for this 
period. 
On February 19, 2014, trial was continued to March 14, 
2014, on McKeown's request because McKeown was waiting for the 
return on the subpoena. McKeown waived his Rule 48 rights for 
this period. 
On April 17, 2014, trial was continued to May 22, 2014, 
because the parties stipulated to a qualified protective order 
regarding health/medical information requiring signatures from 
the State and the Family Court before the records could be 
provided. McKeown waived his Rule 48 rights for this period. 
On May 22, 2014, trial was continued to July 2, 2014, 
because counsel needed time to review the subpoena records and 
provide expert witnesses with the information for review. 
McKeown waived his Rule 48 rights for this period. A total of

which are excluded for Rule 48 purposes. 
On July 2, 2014, proceedings were continued to July 16, 
2014, to hold a hearing on McKeown's Motion to Set Trial wherein 
McKeown requested a trial date in February 2015 due to expert 
availability. A total of 14 days elapsed between July 2, 2014, 
and July 16, 2014, which are excluded for Rule 48 purposes. 
On July 16, 2014, the Family Court granted McKeown's 
Motion to Set Trial, and trial was continued to February 2, 2015. 
McKeown waived his Rule 48 rights for this period. A total of 
201 days elapsed between July 16, 2014, and February 2, 2015, 
which are excluded for Rule 48 purposes. 
On December 10, 2014, McKeown moved for withdrawal and 
substitution of counsel because the attorney was closing his law 
practice. The Family Court granted the motion, and McKeown's 
second attorney indicated at the hearing that he would likely not 
be prepared for trial at the February 2015 trial date. 
On January 21, 2015, trial was continued to March 30, 
2015, on McKeown's request because McKeown's second attorney had 
not yet gone over discovery. McKeown waived his Rule 48 rights 
for this period. A total of 56 days elapsed between February 2, 
2015, and March 30, 2015, which are excluded for Rule 48 
purposes.

April 2015 trial date was maintained, trial would not go on that 
date. 
On March 13, 2015, trial was continued to August 17, 
2015, on McKeown's request because there was supposed to be a 
stipulation to send the pathology slides to an expert. McKeown's 
Rule 48 waiver form reflected the period between April 6, 2015 
and August 17, 2015, but not between March 30, 2015, and April 6, 
2015. A total of 140 days elapsed between March 30, 2015 and 
August 17, 2015, which are excluded for Rule 48 purposes.4 
On June 22, 2015, trial was continued to September 21, 
2015, to allow time for McKeown to prepare a stipulation for 
disclosure of pathology slides. McKeown waived his Rule 48 
rights for this period. A total of 35 days elapsed between 
August 17, 2015, and September 21, 2015, which are excluded for 
Rule 48 purposes. 
On September 15, 2015, trial was continued to June 22, 
2016, on McKeown's request due to expert availability. McKeown 
waived his Rule 48 rights for this period. A total of 266 days 
elapsed between September 21, 2015, and June 13, 2016, which are 
excluded for Rule 48 purposes. 
On June 6, 2016, trial was continued to October 17, 
2016. McKeown waived his Rule 48 rights from August 1, 2016, to 
October 17, 2016, and June 13, 2016, to July 31, 2016 would be 
charged to the State. A total of 49 days elapsed between 
June 13, 2016, and July 31, 2016, which are not excluded for 
Rule 48 purposes. A total of 77 days was found to have elapsed

calculated the time period based on August 24, 2015. However, McKeown also 
waived his Rule 48 rights between August 17, 2015, and August 24, 2015.

for Rule 48 purposes. 
On October 7, 2016, the State filed a Motion to 
Continue Trial Date (State Motion to Continue ), requesting a 
continuance because the prosecutor assigned to this case was in 
trial for another case that would continue through November 2016. 
At the hearing on the State Motion to Continue, McKeown objected 
to the Motion to Continue and did not waive his Rule 48 rights. 
The Family Court continued trial to February 6, 2017, over 
McKeown's objection, noting that most continuances to date had 
been waived by McKeown. The Family Court found a total of 112 
days between October 7, 2016, and February 6, 2017, are included 
for Rule 48 purposes. 
On December 2, 2016, trial was continued to 
September 25, 2017, on McKeown's motion due to expert 
availability. McKeown waived his Rule 48 rights for this period. 
A total of 231 days elapsed between February 6, 2017, and 
September 25, 2017, which are excluded for Rule 48 purposes. 
On August 8, 2017, McKeown again moved for and the 
Family Court granted withdrawal and substitution of counsel. The 
September 25, 2017 trial date was vacated and continued to 
May 14, 2018, due to McKeown's expert availability. McKeown 
waived his Rule 48 rights for this period. 
On April 5, 2018, McKeown filed a Motion to Dismiss 
Indictment, arguing, inter alia, that the indictment should be 
dismissed with prejudice because the competent evidence presented 
to the grand jury failed to establish probable cause to believe

Son died as a result of a delay in medical treatment and/or that 
McKeown caused the death of a human. 
The State submitted a Motion to Dismiss Without 
Prejudice (State Motion to Dismiss ) case number 2FC121000280, 
dated April 16, 2018, with an "Approved and So Ordered" signature 
block for the court. The State Motion to Dismiss was filed the 
next day, April 17, 2018, with the order signed by the Family 
Court. The State later asserted, in response to the Rule 48 
Motion to Dismiss the subsequently filed charge, that the reason 
for the reindictment was that the State became aware of a "major 
error" pertaining to one of its expert witnesses: 
With respect to the State's reindictment of this case, 
the State became aware of a major error pertaining to one of 
its expert witnesses during the beginning of 2017. At the 
time, the State did not have any reason to question the 
accuracy of the subject expert's findings until the State 
had an opportunity to speak with a different expert who 
happened to be testifying in an unrelated matter during the 
latter part of November, 2016, in the above-reference [sic] 
Capobianco case. Based on the new information and evidence 
provided to the State, the State felt compelled to correct 
the record and seek a reindictment in this matter. 
The State further represented: 
[A]t no time is the State saying that the defendant is 
not responsible for the murder of his son. Um, that's clear 
in the transcript. That's clear in the grand jury 
presentation. And all along the State has –- has maintained 
that it was the defendant that caused those injuries. 
The  thing  that  did  change  was  when  they  were  caused, 
the  severity,  and  because  the  injuries,  based  on  the 
State's,  um,  additional  forensic  evidence  through  its 
forensic  expert,  the  evidence  would  have  -- I  mean  the 
injuries  would  have  been  caused  five  to  seven  days  before. 
McKeown  later  acknowledged  that  the  omission  theory  was 
not  new  to  the  defense,  that  the  State  had  not  been  previously 
aware  that  there  was  insufficient  evidence  to  support  the 
omission  theory  in  the  2012  indictment,  and  that  the  defense  knew 
all  along  it  would  possibly  need  to  preserve  testimony  for 
evidence  occurring  for  a  broader  time  period.

As noted above, the Family Court approved the State 
Motion to Dismiss on April 17, 2018; the case was dismissed 
without prejudice. The hearing date for McKeown's April 5, 2018 
motion to dismiss was stricken (per minutes dated May 3, 2018), 
with the court's minutes noting the dismissal without prejudice 
on April 17, 2018. 
A total of 204 days elapsed between September 25, 2017, 
and April 17, 2018, which are excluded for Rule 48 purposes. 
B. Further Proceedings 
On May 23, 2018, the State recharged McKeown via 
indictment in 2FFC-18-0000171 with Murder in the Second Degree in 
violation of HRS § 707-701.5(1). Trial was set for August 27, 
2018. A total of 36 days elapsed between April 17, 2018, and 
May 23, 2018, which are excluded for Rule 48 purposes. 
On June 14, 2018, McKeown requested and was granted 
supervised release. 
On August 27, 2018, trial was continued to March 4, 
2019, because McKeown was still going through evidence, and his 
expert would not be available until the first two weeks of March. 
McKeown waived his Rule 48 rights for this period. A total of 
189 days elapsed between August 27, 2018, and March 4, 2019, 
which are excluded for Rule 48 purposes. 
On January 22, 2019, the parties stipulated to and the 
Family Court approved continuing trial to May 20, 2019. 
McKeown filed the Rule 48 Motion to Dismiss on May 15, 
2019, and the Speedy Trial Motion to Dismiss on June 13, 2019. 
The Family Court heard the motions on June 19, 2019, 
and stated its rationale as follows: 
10          NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Ah,  the  Court  has  sat  on  this  case  since  2012  when  the 
case  came  up.   And  so  I  have  seen,  um,  just  about  all  of  the 
hearings  that  have  occurred  and  there  have  been  many,  many, 
many,  many  hearings. 
Um,  I  -- I  wanted  to  say  that  the  Court  didn't  observe 
any,  and  I  think  to  use  your  word,  um,  malicious  conduct  on 
either  side.   Um,  I  think  it  was  -- I  think  it  was  always 
heart  wrenching  when  one  of  the  attorneys  involved  had  to 
withdraw  because  it  basically  restarted  the  case. 
Kind  of  like  what  happened  when  you  came  on  board,  Mr. 
Nardi,  just  last  year.   Um,  what  made  it  extremely  difficult 
was  that  Mr.  McKeown  was  in  custody  most  of  that  time  or  a 
lot  of  that  time.   Um,  and  that  was  factored  in  as  the 
delays  became  more  and  more,  for  whatever  the  reasons  were. 
Um,  but  I  agree  with  you  that  it's,  while  not  directly 
relevant  as  to  how  many  attorneys  were  assigned  and  why  they 
left,  um,  I  just  don't  attribute  that  blame  to  either  side.  
It  certainly  wasn't  Mr.  McKeown  firing  his  attorneys.   It 
wasn't  that  case.   And  it  wasn't  the  attorneys  not  being 
willing  to  serve.   There  were  different  circumstances  that 
caused  that. 
But  in  many  (inaudible)  we  were  just  towards  the  end 
getting  ready  to  start  a  trial  and  then  someone  would  get  up 
and  leave.   And  -- and  I  think  that  was  especially 
troubling,  um,  and  that  happened  with  -- we  know  now  that 
you're  the  fourth  attorney  that  was  assigned  to  this  case. 
The  second  part  that  the  Court  recalls,  ah,  that  was  a 
significant  part  was  the  availability  of  experts,  or  the 
unavailability  of  experts,  might  be  more. 
There  are  some  experts  that  weren't  ready  for  six 
months.   They  weren't  going  to  be  available.   And  to  his 
credit,  Mr.  McKeown  waived  most  of  that  time  I  think  at  the 
-- at  the  discussions  of  his  attorney  and  -- and  at  their 
advice. 
Um,  those  seem  to  be  the  two  biggest  factors  that  I 
can  recall  in  this  case  just  as  a  group  or  as  a  -- as  a 
majority  of  the  reasons  why  these  cases  were  continued.   Was 
either  to  accomodate  the  experts  or  because  the  attorneys 
were  leaving. 
   . . . . 
I  was  at  all  of  those  hearings  and  I  -- the  attorneys 
were  very  much  in  agreement  with  the  delays  that  were 
occurring  for  whatever  advantage  that  each  side  may  have  --
may  have  gotten  from  that. 
   . . . . 
A  person  who  witnessed  that  being  the  case,  at  least 
there  were  no  objections  made  by  defense,  previous  counsel, 
I  can  understand  why  you  would  object  now.   But  at  the  time 
there  were  no  counsel  saying,  your  Honor,  the  State's 
dragging  their  feet.   They're  not  getting  us  the  documents, 
you  know,  we're  at  a  disadvantage.   Um,  the  parties  seem  to 
be  in  agreement  with  the  pace  at  which  the  trial  was 
proceeding.   That's  the  best  I  can  say.

On July 31, 2019, the Family Court entered Findings of 
Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order (2019 FOFs/COLs/Order ), 
dismissing 2FFC-18-0000171 without prejudice. A total of 107 
days elapsed between March 4, 2019, and June 19, 2019, which are 
excluded for Rule 48 purposes. 
The total number of days elapsed from May 30, 2012, to 
June 19, 2019, is 2,576 days. Of the 2,576 elapsed days, 2,196 
days are excluded and 380 days are not excluded under Rule 48. 
Accordingly, considering the permissible 180 day period pursuant 
to Rule 48, McKeown was subject to an excess period of 200 days. 
McKeown timely appealed the 2019 FOFs/COLs/Order. On 
May 28, 2021, we vacated and remanded the 2019 FOFs/COLs/Order 
with instructions to the Family Court to make specific findings 
regarding the State Motion to Continue and the Family Court's 
consideration thereof in its analysis. On December 29, 2021, the 
Family Court entered the FOFs/COLs/Order. 
The Family Court entered, inter alia, the following 
findings regarding the State Motion to Continue and State Motion 
to Dismiss: 
17. On October 7, 2016, the State filed a Motion to 
Continue Trial (hereinafter "State's Motion"). The State's 
Motion was heard on October 12, 2016. The basis for the 
State's Motion was due to the assigned Deputy Prosecutor 
Robert Rivera being in trial in another case, State v. 
Capobianco (2PC161000133). At the hearing on State's 
Motion, the Defendant objected to the State's request for 
continuance and did not waive any rights under HRPP Rule 48. 
Over Defendant's objection, the Court granted the State's 
Motion and trial was set for February 6, 2017. A total of 
112 days elapsed between October 17, 2016, and February 6, 
2017, and those day are included pursuant to HRPP Rule 
48(c)(3). 
   . . . . 
21
. On April 17, 2018, the State of Hawaii made a 
Motion to Dismiss without Prejudice case number 
2FC121000280. The Court granted the motion and the case was 
dismissed without Prejudice.

Analysis of the Estencion Factors 
    . . . . 
7. Un
der the
 second Estencion factor, the court may 
consider whether the delay was caused by the State's neglect 
or deliberate misconduct, delays caused by the court itself, 
or whether the delay was caused by the defendant's own 
conduct. State v. Fukuoka , 141 Hawai i 48, 60,  404 P.3d 
314, 326 (2017). "Responsibility for Rule 48's efficacy 
does not rest solely on the prosecutor, but 'the prosecutor, 
the court, and the accused share responsibility for carrying 
out the speedy trial requirements of Rule 48.'" State v.
 
Faalafua , 67 Haw. 335, 339, 686 P.2d 826, 829 (1984) 
(quoting State v. Soto, 63 Haw. 317, 321, 627 P.2d 279, 281 
(1981)). In this case, neither party has ever engaged in 
deliberate misconduct or neglect which would have 
contributed to a delay in the proceedings. Moreover, it was 
the Court's observation that the parties were very much in 
agreement with the delays and continuances that were 
occurring for whatever advantage each side may have gained 
from it. 
   .. . . 
8.
 The second Estencion factor weighs in favor of a 
dismissal without prejudice. 
9. "[U]nder the third Estencion factor, the court 
evaluates considerations relating to the purposes of HRPP 
Rule 48 and the administration of justice." Fukuoka , 141 
Hawai i  at 6 2, 404 P.3d at 329. "In analyzing the third 
Estenc
ion factor . . . the court must also consider[] the 
impact of reprosecution on the administration of justice 
generally." Id. at 63, 404 P.3d at 329. "Prejudice to the 
defendant may also be considered when analyzing the impact 
of reprosecution on the administration of HRPP rule 48 and 
the administration of justice." Id. The presence of 
prejudice to the defendant may be of substantial importance 
of analyzing the third Estencion factor, but "there is no 
requirement that the absence of prejudice be separately 
considered prior to dismissal with prejudice under Rule 
48(b)." Id. at 64, 404 P.3d at 330 (internal quotation 
marks and citation omitted). In this case, considering the 
possible prejudices which include lack of memory and loss of 
potential witnesses as a result of the delay in the trial 
proceedings and as a result of the prosecution re-filing 
charges under both the commission and omission theories, the 
Court found that parties had been in agreement in most of 
the delays in the trial proceedings. Further, the Court 
finds no impropriety on the part of the State in re-filing 
charges using an additional theory as the "Rules of [Penal] 
Procedure allow for a dismissal of a case and refiling when 
there's a change in circumstance or a change in evidence."

10. The third Estencion factor weighs in favor of a 
dismissal without prejudice. 
12. The Court further concludes based on the analysis 
of the three (3) Estencion factors as noted above, that a 
dismissal without prejudice is warranted. 
Analysis of Speedy Trial Factors 
14. In this case, delays in the trial were a result 
of agreement by the parties, with the consent of the 
Defendant, or due to withdrawal of defense attorneys, [sic] 
There were only two (2) significant periods of delay 
attributed to the State. Once when the assigned Prosecutor 
was in trial in another high-profile case and then following 
the dismissal of 2FC121000280 and the re-filing of charges 
in the current case number. Therefore, the first two 
factors, weigh in favor of the State, as previously found in 
the HRPP Rule 48 analysis. 
15. As to factor three (3), the assertion of his 
right to a speedy trial, the Defendant did not make any 
active assertions during the pendency of the case until 
filing a Motion to Dismiss for Speedy Trial Violation on 
June 13, 2019. The Defendant was ready for trial in June 
and October of 2016 when the assigned prosecutor became 
unavailable due to being in trial in another courtroom. 
During that time, the Defendant did not waive his rights to 
a speedy trial and/or HRPP Rule 48. At all other times, the 
parties were in agreement as to continuances. Therefore, 
the third speedy trial factor weighs in favor of the State. 
16. The fourth factor, prejudice to the defendant 
weighs in favor of the State, as Defendant has only made a 
showing of possible prejudice, rather than specific 
prejudice. 
17. Based on findings set forth above and taking into 
consideration the numerous accommodations to continue and 
the cooperation between the parties to seek a trial date the 
Court cannot conclude that the Defendant's right to a speedy 
trial has been violated.

McKeown timely filed a Notice of Appeal. 
II. POINTS OF ERROR 
McKeown   raises  two  points  of  error  on  appeal, 
contending   that  the  Family  Court  erred  in  failing   to  dismiss 
2FFC-18-0000171   with  prejudice   (1)  as  a  result  of  a  HRPP  Rule  48 
violation,  and  (2)  on  the  grounds  that  McKeown's  rights  to  a

and article I, section 14 of the Hawai i Constitution were 
violated. 
III. APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
We review a trial court's decision to dismiss a case 
with or without prejudice for violation of HRPP Rule 48 for 
abuse of discretion. See State v. Estencion , 63 Haw. 264, 
269, 625 P.2d 1040, 1044 (1981). An abuse of discretion 
occurs when "the decisionmaker 'exceeds the bounds of reason 
or disregards rules or principles of law or practice to the 
substantial detriment of a party.'" State v. Kony, 138 
Hawai i 1,  8, 37 5 P.3d 1239, 1246 (2016) (quoting State v. 
Vliet, 95  Hawai i  94, 108, 19  P.3d 42, 56 (2001)). 
State v. Fukuoka ,  141 Hawai i 48, 55, 404 P.3d 314, 321 (2017). 
The  appellate  court  reviews  questions  of  constitutional 
law  under  the  right/wrong  standard.   State  v.  Davis,  133  Hawai i 
102,  111,  324  P.3d  912,  921  (2014). 
IV.
 DISCUSSION 
A. Rule 48 Dismissal - With or Without Prejudice 
Pursuant to HRPP Rule 48(b), trial must commence within 
six months from the date of arrest if bail is set or from the 
filing of the charge, whichever is sooner. If the initial charge 
is dismissed and recharged with the same charge, the time period 
for the proceedings for both offenses are computed together, 
albeit with the exclusion of the period between the dismissal of 
the initial charge and the filing of the new charge. See, e.g., 
State v. Holt, 67 Haw. 246, 247, 684 P.2d 971, 971-92 (1984) 
(computing time period for Rule 48 purposes based on proceedings 
for both initial charge and subsequent re-indictment, excluding 
the time period between the charge and the re-indictment). 
It is undisputed that the Family Court properly found a 
Rule 48 violation and dismissed the case. McKeown argues, 
however, that the Family Court abused its discretion in failing 
to order dismissal with prejudice.

          NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In State v. Estencion ,  the Hawai i Supreme  Court held: 
In  determining  whether  to  dismiss  the  case  with  or  without 
prejudice,  the  court  shall  consider,  among  others,  each  of 
the  following  factors:   the  seriousness  of  the  offense;  the 
facts  and  the  circumstances  of  the  case  which  led  to  the 
dismissal;  and  the  impact  of  a  reprosecution  on  the 
administration  of  this  chapter  and  on  the  administration  of 
justice. 
63 Haw. at 269, 625 P.2d at 1044. 
It is undisputed that the first Estencion factor – the 
seriousness of the offense – weighs in favor of dismissal without 
prejudice. The charge here stems from the alleged murder of a 
young child by his own father. As noted by the Family Court, due 
to the special circumstances of the offense, McKeown faces the 
possibility of life in prison without parole. 
McKeown argues that the Family Court erroneously 
concluded that the second Estencion factor – reason for delay 
that led to dismissal – and third Estencion factor – impact of 
reprosecution on the administration of justice – both weighed in 
favor of dismissal without prejudice. In the alternative, 
McKeown argues that the Family Court abused its discretion by 
dismissing without prejudice without properly considering the 
second and third Estencion factors. McKeown argues that the 
Family Court failed to consider the delay caused by granting the 
State Motion to Continue over objection and the State Motion to 
Dismiss one month prior to trial in analyzing the second and 
third Estencion factors. McKeown argues that the Family Court 
erred in finding that the parties agreed to the delays because 
McKeown objected to the State Motion to Continue and the State 
Motion to Dismiss. 
The Family Court clearly did consider the delays 
attributable to the State as they are included in the court's 
16          
   
   
        
          
         
          
          
         
       
       
         
         
          
         
          
           
      NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
FOFs.   The  crux  of  the  issue  appears  to  be  whether  the  Family 
Court  allocated  adequate  weight  to  those  delays  in  concluding 
that  the  second  Estencion  factor  weighs  in  favor  of  dismissal.  
Notably,  "[i]n  evaluating  the  facts  and  circumstances  of  the 
case,  the  court  should  focus  on  'the  culpability  of  the  conduct 
that  led  to  the  delay.'"   Fukuoka,  141  Hawai i  at  60,  404  P.3d  at 
326.   The  court  may  consider  whether  the  delay  was  caused  by  the 
State's  neglect  or  deliberate  misconduct,  the  defendant's 
conduct,  or  by  the  court  itself.   Id.   The  court,  the 
prosecution,  and  the  defendant  all  share  the  responsibility  to 
facilitate  the  timely  resolution  of  proceedings.   See  id.  at  61-
62,  404  P.3d  at  327-28. 
Although
 continuances requested by the defendant are 
excluded in computing the time for trial commencement under 
Rule 48, the trial court may consider these excluded time periods 
in evaluating whether the Estencion factors weigh in favor of 
dismissal with or without prejudice. See, e.g., id. at 61-62, 
66, 404 P.3d at 327-28, 332 (holding that in evaluating the

Here, in weighing the second Estencion factor, the 
Family Court concluded in COL 7 that neither party ever engaged 
in deliberate misconduct or neglect which would have contributed 
to a delay in the proceedings. The Family Court presided over 
the many, many proceedings involving delays and observed that the 
parties were very much in agreement with the delays and 
continuances that were occurring. Obviously, this did not 
include the two instances relied on by McKeown, the State Motion 
to Continue and the State Motion to Dismiss. The Family Court's 
FOFs and the record indicate that the majority of the 
continuances were indeed upon McKeown's request or with his 
agreement. Approximately seven years (2,576 days) elapsed since 
the May 30, 2012 indictment, approximately six years (2,196 days) 
of which were excluded via McKeown's waiver, and approximately 
one year (380 days) of which was not excluded. Based on the 
record, there were over two dozen continuances and/or delays, at 
least thirteen of which were on McKeown's request or due to 
McKeown's motions, and the vast majority of which were otherwise 
agreed to and waived by McKeown. The record indicates that these 
continuances were primarily due to the withdrawal and 
substitution of three of McKeown's attorneys, the availability or 
unavailability of McKeown's experts, and additional time needed 
for the production and review of records by McKeown's attorneys 
or experts. 
Regarding the State Motion to Continue, McKeown argues 
that a delay due to the prosecutor being in a separate trial was 
foreseeable, the State should have assigned a different 
prosecutor to McKeown's case, and the refusal to assign a

different  prosecutor  supports  dismissal  with  prejudice.  
However,  even  if  that  particular  delay  might  have  potentially 
been  avoidable,  there  is  no  argument  or  support  for  the 
proposition  that  it  was  malicious  or  calculated,  and  that  on 
balance,  the  facts  and  circumstances  of  that  delay  do  not  weigh 
in  favor  of  dismissal  with  prejudice.   See  State  v.  Kim,  109 6

balance  toward  dismissal  with  prejudice.");  see  also  State  v.

unreasonable  delay).   
McKeown also
 argues that the State Motion to Dismiss 
was a deliberate delay done to create a tactical advantage less 
than a month before trial was set to commence. McKeown asserts 
that because he had motions pending designed to limit the State 
to presenting only a theory of acute injury, the State re-
indicted McKeown with evidence in direct conflict with the acute 
injury theory, and instead relied on a theory of omission, 
thereby weakening McKeown's defense. The Family Court found, 
6 The Family Court stated in FOF 17 that the prosecutor in this case 
was in trial in State v. Capobianco , 2PC161000133. This court takes judicial 
notice that the Capobianco case involved a jury trial on charges of second 
degree murder and arson and was conducted over several months before the jury 
reached a verdict. The prosecutor first appeared in this case (McKeown) when 
the original complaint was filed on June 1, 2012.

however, that the State re-filed charges under both commission 
and omission theories, and that there was "no impropriety on the 
part of the State in re-filing charges using an additional theory 
as the [HRPP] allow for a dismissal of a case and refiling when 
there's a change in circumstance or a change in evidence." 
Indeed, the 2012 indictment charged McKeown under both commission 
and the omission theories. The 2012 indictment also charged 
McKeown based on a time period spanning May 21, 2012, through 
May 29, 2012, i.e., the nine days prior to Son's death on May 30, 
2012. McKeown in his 2018 Motion to Dismiss argued that the 
Family Court should dismiss or strike the omission theory portion 
of the 2012 indictment because the State had not presented 
sufficient competent evidence that Son died as a result of a 
failure to act. The State then dismissed the initial charges, 
re-indicted McKeown, and entered evidence supporting the omission 
theory. The State explained that the re-indictment was necessary 
because it became aware of a major error pertaining to one of its 
expert witnesses regarding the timing and severity of the 
injuries leading to Son's death. McKeown has acknowledged that 
the omission theory was not new to the defense, that the State 
had not been previously aware that there was insufficient 
evidence to support the omission theory in the 2012 indictment, 
and that the defense knew all along it would possibly need to 
preserve testimony for evidence occurring for a broader time 
period. Accordingly, it was not clearly erroneous for the Family 
Court to find that the State's re-indictment of McKeown was not 
due to a deliberate delay or to hamper the defense.

Based on a review of the entirety of the record, we 
conclude that the Family Court properly weighed the delays caused 
by the State against delays caused or agreed to by the defendant 
and did not err or abuse its discretion in concluding that on 
balance, the second Estencion factor does not weigh in favor of 
dismissal with prejudice. 
With respect to the third Estencion factor, McKeown 
argues that the impact of reprosecution on the administration of 
justice weighs in favor of dismissal with prejudice because 
McKeown's case had already been dismissed twice, the lengthy 
delay caused by the State resulted in an unreasonably oppressive 
amount of pretrial incarceration, and the defense was prejudiced 
when the State changed its theory of the case after the case had 
been pending for five years. 
In analyzing the third Estencion factor, the court "may 
consider whether the State or the court's conduct reflect a 
pattern of lack of diligence, thereby suggesting that dismissal 
with prejudice is necessary to vindicate the purposes of HRPP 
Rule 48 and justice generally." Fukuoka ,
 141 Hawai i at 63, 404 
P.3d at 329. The court may also consider prejudice to the 
defendant due to the length of the delay insofar as a lengthy 
delay may reflect a lack of due diligence on the part of the 
State or the court. Id. at 65, 404 P.3d at 331. Prejudice to 
the defendant is not a mandatory factor to be considered by the 
trial court prior to ordering dismissal with prejudice under 
Rule 48. Id. at 64, 404 P.3d at 330. However, a finding of 
prejudice is not insignificant. Kim,

Here, the Family Court analyzed the third Estencion 
factor as follows: 
In this case, considering the possible prejudices which 
include lack of memory and loss of potential witnesses as a 
result of the delay in the trial proceedings and as a result 
of the prosecution re-filing charges under both the 
commission and omission theories, the Court found that 
parties had been in agreement in most of the delays in the 
trial proceedings. Further, the Court finds no impropriety 
on the part of the State in re-filing charges using an 
additional theory as the "Rules of [Penal] Procedure allow 
for a dismissal of a case and refiling when there's a change 
in circumstance or a change in evidence." 
McKeown argues that the delay combined with the State's 
change in theory caused him prejudice because McKeown would have 
to search for witnesses who may no longer be available or have 
lost their memories of the days leading up to Son's death. 
However, as McKeown acknowledges in his opening brief, the Family 
Court expressly addressed the possibility of prejudice due to 
lack of memory and loss of potential witnesses as a result of the 
delay in trial proceedings, and nevertheless concluded that the 
third Estencion factor weighed in favor of dismissal without 
prejudice. McKeown does not point to specific witnesses or 
potentially exculpatory evidence that might have been lost or 
forgotten due to the delays caused by the State. McKeown 
generally asserts that the delay combined with the State's change 
in theory resulted in him having to search for witnesses who saw 
Son five to seven days prior to Son's death, five years after the 
observations were made. However, the majority of the over five 
year delay prior to the State re-filing the charges against 
McKeown was upon McKeown's request or with his agreement, and not 
due to a lack of due diligence on the part of the State or court.

On  this  record,  notwithstanding  the  overall  period  of 
delay,  as  well  as  the  period  of  delay  attributable  to  the  State, 
we  conclude  that  the  Family  Court  did  not  abuse  its  discretion  in 
determining  that  the  third  Estencion  factor  weighed  in  favor  of 
dismissal  without  prejudice.   Accordingly,  we  conclude  that  the 
Family  Court  did  not  abuse  its  discretion  in  dismissing  the  case 
without  prejudice  for  violation  of  Rule  48. 
B. Constitutional Rights to a Speedy Trial 
McKeown  argues   that  the  Family  Court  erred  in  failing 
to  dismiss  the  indictment  with  prejudice  as  a  result  of  the 
violation  of  McKeown's  constitutional  right  to  a  speedy  trial 
because  all  four  Barker  factors  weigh  in  favor  of  finding  a 
constitutional  speedy  trial  violation.   McKeown  challenges  COLs 
14  to  17  in  conjunction  with  his  argument  that  his  constitutional 
right  to  a  speedy  trial  was  violated.  
The  Sixth  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution 
and  article  I,  section  14  of  the  Hawai i   Cons titution 
guarantee  a  defendant  in  a  criminal  case  the  right  to  a 
speedy  trial  in  all  prosecutions.   State  v.  Lau,  78  Hawai i 
54,  62,  890  P.2d  291,  299  (1995).   Whether  the  defendant's 
right  to  a  speedy  trial  has  been  violated  is  determined  by 
applying  the  four  factors  articulated  in  Barker  v.  Wingo, 
407  U.S.  514,  92  S.Ct.  2182,  33  L.Ed.2d  101  (1972):   "(1) 
length  of  the  delay;  (2)  reasons  for  the  delay;  (3) 
defendant's  assertion  of  his  right  to  speedy  trial;  and  (4) 
prejudice  to  the  defendant."   Lau,  78  Hawai i  at  62,  890 
P.2d  at  299  (citing  Barker,  407  U.S.  at  530,  92  S.Ct.  2182).  
No  one  factor  "is  to  be  regarded  as  either  a  necessary  or 
sufficient  condition  to  the  finding  of  a  deprivation  of  the 
right  to  a  speedy  trial."   Id.  (quoting  State  v.  Wasson,  76 
Hawai i  415,  419,  879  P.2d  520,  524  (1994)).   Rather,  the 
factors  are  related  "and  must  be  considered  together  with 
such  circumstances  as  may  be  relevant."   Id.  (quoting 
Wasson,  76  Hawai i  at  419,  879  P.2d  at  524).   When  a 
defendant's  right  to  a  speedy  trial  has  been  violated,  the 
only  remedy  is  dismissal  with  prejudice.   Id. 
State v. Visintin ,  143 Hawai i 143, 156-57, 426 P.3d 367, 380-81 
(2018). 
The supreme court further explained:

in Barker, that different weights are assigned to different

reasons in determining whether a delay of trial violates a 
defendant's constitutional speedy trial right. A deliberate 
attempt to delay the trial in order to hamper the defense 
should be weighted heavily against the government. A more 
neutral reason such as negligence or overcrowded courts 
should be weighted less heavily but nevertheless should be 
considered since the ultimate responsibility for such 
circumstances must rest with the government rather than with 
the defendant. 
Id. at 159, 426 P.3d at 383 (quoting Lau, 78 Hawai i  at 63,  890 
P.2d at 300) (cleaned up). 
Regarding the first Barker factor – length of delay – 
McKeown argues that the Family Court erred in stating the delays 
were a result of agreement by the parties. For purposes of its 
speedy trial analysis, the Family Court clearly recognized that 
most, but not all, of the delays were by agreement of the 
parties. McKeown further argues that the 380 day length of the 
delays is excessive, and that the first Barker factor therefore 
weighs in favor of a finding of a violation of McKeown's right to 
a speedy trial. 
We note that the length of delay factor serves as a 
trigger for whether inquiry into the other Barker factors is 
warranted. State v. White,
 92 Hawai i at 202, 990 P.2d at 100 
("The length of delay triggers the Barker analysis."). It does 
not itself weigh in favor of or against a finding of a speedy 
trial violation. See id. at 203, 990 P.2d at 101 (holding that 
eleven-month delay warranted inquiry into the other Barker 
factors). 
Here, as discussed supra, the Family Court found that 
the total number of days that were not waived by McKeown was 380 
days, and the vast majority of the cumulatively lengthy delay of 
2,576 days were upon request, with agreement, and/or upon waiver 
by McKeown. The length of the delay here warranted inquiry into 
24          
          
           
           
         
        
       
          
        
         
            
           
          
          
          
         
         
        
      
           
          
          
          
           
          
          
           
            
             NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the other Barker factors. The Family Court concluded that the 
length of the delay and the second Barker factor – reasons for 
delay – weighed in favor of the State, pointing to the other 
high-profile trial the prosecutor was in, and the dismissal and 
refiling, which was due to new information concerning flawed 
evidence previously presented to support the earlier indictment, 
as supporting that conclusion. It appears that the Family Court 
viewed the State-caused reasons for delay as neutral, and 
considered that the lengthiness of the overall delay weighed in 
favor of the State because most of the delay was at the request 
or with the agreement of McKeown. We cannot conclude that the 
Family Court erred in this determination. See White,
 92 Hawai i 
at
 203-05, 990 P.2d at 101-02 (holding that on balance, the 
second Barker factor weighed in favor of the State because the 
defendant contributed in substantial part to the delay which he 
later claimed prejudiced him, and the State's delay did not 
appear to be calculated to cause unreasonable delay). 
Regarding the third Barker factor – defendant's 
assertion of his right to speedy trial – McKeown argues that the 
Family Court erred by failing to explain why the two significant 
periods of delay attributed to the State did not support the 
finding of a constitutional violation, or how it is mitigated by 
other delays. McKeown submits that he had demanded that his case 
proceed to trial at the time of these two delays. 
A defendant has no duty to bring himself or herself to 
trial; the State has that duty. Visintin ,
 143 Hawai i at 160, 
426 P.3d at 384 (quoting Wasson,
 76 Hawai i at 420, 879 P.2d at 
525). Thus, a defendant does not waive his or her right to a

        NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
speedy trial by failing to demand one. Id. However, the 
assertion of the right to a speedy trial is "entitled to strong 
evidentiary weight in determining whether the defendant is being 
deprived of the right." Id. (quoting Barker, 407 U.S. at 531-
32). A defendant's motion to dismiss based on speedy trial "is 
tantamount to an assertion of his or her constitutional right to 
a speedy trial." Id. (quoting Wasson, 76 Hawai i  at 420-21,  879 
P.2d at 525-26). 
Here, McKeown did in fact file his Speedy Trial Motion 
to Dismiss on June 13, 2019 – after he was re-indicted following 
the granting of the State Motion to Dismiss – asserting his 
constitutional right to a speedy trial had been violated. 
McKeown argues that he demanded that his case proceed to trial 
when the State filed the State Motion to Continue and the State 
Motion to Dismiss, but he does not provide any support in the 
record showing that he previously asserted his speedy trial 
rights.7 Indeed, just prior to the State Motion to Dismiss, 
McKeown had filed his own Motion to Dismiss and did not raise any 
arguments regarding his right to a speedy trial. In the Speedy 
Trial Motion to Dismiss, McKeown did not demand or assert that he 
wanted a speedy trial; rather, he demanded that the indictment be 
dismissed with prejudice because of a speedy trial violation. 
This is more than a semantical distinction in this case because 
of the years of delay in asserting his speedy trial rights and in 
seeking delays for reasons that were beneficial to his defense – 
7 McKeown filed no written opposition to the State Motion to 
Continue and did not request or otherwise provide a transcript for the October

at no point did McKeown actually assert that he wanted a speedy 
trial. 
In  Barker,  the  Supreme  Court  explored  the  difficulty  of 
this  analysis  and  concluded  that  a  flexible  approach,  rather  than 
a  rigid  test,  was  necessary  to  properly  determine  whether  a 
defendant's  constitutional  right  to  a  speedy  trial  was  violated: 
[A] suggested alternative would restrict consideration 
of the right to those cases in which the accused has 
demanded a speedy trial. Most States have recognized what 
is loosely referred to as the 'demand rule,' although eight 
States reject it. It is not clear, however, precisely what 
is meant by that term. Although every federal court of 
appeals that has considered the question has endorsed some 
kind of demand rule, some have regarded the rule within the 
concept of waiver, whereas others have viewed it as a factor 
to be weighed in assessing whether there has been a 
deprivation of the speedy trial right. We shall refer to 
the former approach as the demand-waiver doctrine. The 
demand-waiver doctrine provides that a defendant waives any 
consideration of his right to speedy trial for any period 
prior to which he has not demanded a trial. Under this 
rigid approach, a prior demand is a necessary condition to 
the consideration of the speedy trial right. . . . 
Such  an  approach,  by  presuming  waiver  of  a  fundamental 
right  from  inaction,  is  inconsistent  with  this  Court's 
pronouncements  on  waiver  of  constitutional  rights.   The 
Court  has  defined  waiver  as  an  intentional  relinquishment  or 
abandonment  of  a  known  right  or  privilege.   Courts  should 
indulge  every  reasonable  presumption  against  waiver,  and 
they  should  not  presume  acquiescence  in  the  loss  of 
fundamental  rights.   [W]e  have  held: 
Pr
esuming waiver from a silent record is 
impermissible. The record must show, or there must be 
an allegation and evidence which show, that an accused 
was offered counsel but intelligently and 
understandably rejected the offer. Anything less is 
not waiver. 
The Court has ruled similarly with respect to waiver 
of other rights designed to protect the accused. 
In  excepting  the  right  to  speedy  trial  from  the  rule 
of  waiver  we  have  applied  to  other  fundamental  rights, 
courts  that  have  applied  the  demand-waiver  rule  have  relied 
on  the  assumption  that  delay  usually  works  for  the  benefit 
of  the  accused  and  on  the  absence  of  any  readily 
ascertainable  time  in  the  criminal  process  for  a  defendant 
to  be  given  the  choice  of  exercising  or  waiving  his  right.  
But  it  is  not  necessarily  true  that  delay  benefits  the 
defendant.   There  are  cases  in  which  delay  appreciably  harms 
the  defendant's  ability  to  defend  himself.   Moreover,  a 
defendant  confined  to  jail  prior  to  trial  is  obviously 
disadvantaged  by  delay  as  is  a  defendant  released  on  bail 
but  unable  to  lead  a  normal  life  because  of  community 
suspicion  and  his  own  anxiety. 
27          NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The  nature  of  the  speedy  trial  right  does  make  it 
impossible  to  pinpoint  a  precise  time  in  the  process  when 
the  right  must  be  asserted  or  waived,  but  that  fact  does  not 
argue  for  placing  the  burden  of  protecting  the  right  solely 
on  defendants.   A  defendant  has  no  duty  to  bring  himself  to 
trial;  the  State  has  that  duty  as  well  as  the  duty  of 
insuring  that  the  trial  is  consistent  with  due  process.  
Moreover,  for  the  reasons  earlier  expressed,  society  has  a 
particular  interest  in  bringing  swift  prosecutions,  and 
society's  representatives  are  the  ones  who  should  protect 
that  interest. 
It  is  also  noteworthy  that  such  a  rigid  view  of  the 
demand-waiver  rule  places  defense  counsel  in  an  awkward 
position.   Unless  he  demands  a  trial  early  and  often,  he  is 
in  danger  of  frustrating  his  client's  right.   If  counsel  is 
willing  to  tolerate  some  delay  because  he  finds  it 
reasonable  and  helpful  in  preparing  his  own  case,  he  may  be 
unable  to  obtain  a  speedy  trial  for  his  client  at  the  end  of 
that  time.   Since  under  the  demand-waiver  rule  no  time  runs 
until  the  demand  is  made,  the  government  will  have  whatever 
time  is  otherwise  reasonable  to  bring  the  defendant  to  trial 
after  a  demand  has  been  made.   Thus,  if  the  first  demand  is 
made  three  months  after  arrest  in  a  jurisdiction  which 
prescribes  a  six-month  rule,  the  prosecution  will  have  a 
total  of  nine  months—which  may  be  wholly  unreasonable  under 
the  circumstances.   The  result  in  practice  is  likely  to  be 
either  an  automatic,  pro  forma  demand  made  immediately  after 
appointment  of  counsel  or  delays  which,  but  for  the 
demand-waiver  rule,  would  not  be  tolerated.   Such  a  result 
is  not  consistent  with  the  interests  of  defendants,  society, 
or  the  Constitution. 
We  reject,  therefore,  the  rule  that  a  defendant  who 
fails  to  demand  a  speedy  trial  forever  waives  his  right.  
This  does  not  mean,  however,  that  the  defendant  has  no 
responsibility  to  assert  his  right.   We  think  the  better 
rule  is  that  the  defendant's  assertion  of  or  failure  to 
assert  his  right  to  a  speedy  trial  is  one  of  the  factors  to 
be  considered  in  an  inquiry  into  the  deprivation  of  the 
right.   Such  a  formulation  avoids  the  rigidities  of  the 
demand-waiver  rule  and  the  resulting  possible  unfairness  in 
its  application.   It  allows  the  trial  court  to  exercise  a 
judicial  discretion  based  on  the  circumstances,  including 
due  consideration  of  any  applicable  formal  procedural  rule.  
It  would  permit,  for  example,  a  court  to  attach  a  different 
weight  to  a  situation  in  which  the  defendant  knowingly  fails 
to  object  from  a  situation  in  which  his  attorney  acquiesces 
in  long  delay  without  adequately  informing  his  client,  or 
from  a  situation  in  which  no  counsel  is  appointed.   It  would 
also  allow  a  court  to  weigh  the  frequency  and  force  of  the 
objections  as  opposed  to  attaching  significant  weight  to  a 
purely  pro  forma  objection. 
In  ruling  that  a  defendant  has  some  responsibility  to 
assert  a  speedy  trial  claim,  we  do  not  depart  from  our 
holdings  in  other  cases  concerning  the  waiver  of  fundamental 
rights,  in  which  we  have  placed  the  entire  responsibility  on 
the  prosecution  to  show  that  the  claimed  waiver  was 
knowingly  and  voluntarily  made.   Such  cases  have  involved 
rights  which  must  be  exercised  or  waived  at  a  specific  time 
or  under  clearly  identifiable  circumstances,  such  as  the 
rights  to  plead  not  guilty,  to  demand  a  jury  trial,  to 
exercise  the  privilege  against  self-incrimination,  and  to 
have  the  assistance  of  counsel.   We  have  shown  above  that 
the  right  to  a  speedy  trial  is  unique  in  its  uncertainty  as

to when and under what circumstances it must be asserted or 
may be deemed waived. But the rule we announce today, which 
comports with constitutional principles, places the primary 
burden on the courts and the prosecutors to assure that 
cases are brought to trial. We hardly need add that if 
delay is attributable to the defendant, then his waiver may 
be given effect under standard waiver doctrine, the demand 
rule aside. 
We, therefore, reject both of the inflexible 
approaches—the fixed-time period because it goes further 
than the Constitution requires; the demand-waiver rule 
because it is insensitive to a right which he have deemed 
fundamental. The approach we accept is a balancing test, in 
which the conduct of both the prosecution and the defendant 
are weighed. 
Barker, 407 U.S. at 523-30 (cleaned up). 
In implementing that approach here, we cannot conclude 
that the third Barker factor weighed heavily in favor of either 
McKeown or the State. As the Supreme Court further explained, 
none of the Barker factors are either necessary or sufficient to 
establish a deprivation of the constitutional right of speedy 
trial. Id. at 533 ("these factors have no talismatic qualities; 
courts must still engage in a difficult and sensitive balancing 
process . . . carried out with full recognition that the 
accused's interest in a speedy trial is specifically affirmed in 
the Constitution"). 
Thus, we turn to the fourth Barker factor – prejudice 
to the defendant. McKeown was prejudiced to an extent by the 
pretrial time he spent incarcerated, although he was released in 
2019 before he asserted his speedy trial rights were violated. 
We similarly recognize that McKeown has lived under a cloud of 
suspicion that he murdered his four-year-old child. However, 
there is no specific claim that witnesses died or evidence 
otherwise became unavailable due to the delay, although that 
remains a possibility as the case has not gone to trial and the 
case against McKeown was dismissed without prejudice, apparently

without a further indictment. We cannot conclude that this 
factor weighs heavily in favor of either party. However, we also 
cannot conclude that the Family Court clearly erred in 
determining that it weighed more in favor of the State. 
Considering all of the Barker factors, and the specific 
and overall circumstances reflected in the Family Court findings 
and conclusions, as well as the entirety of the record in this 
case, particularly the extended periods of delay for which 
McKeown was responsible or in which he acquiesced without seeking 
a speedy trial, we conclude that the Family Court did not err in 
determining that McKeown's constitutional right to speedy trial 
was not violated. Importantly, however, we further conclude that 
if McKeown were re-indicted and tried, in light of the additional 
passage of time, if, for example, witnesses died or evidence 
disappeared or testimony at trial indicated major lapses of 
memory, or the circumstances otherwise changed to McKeown's 
prejudice, McKeown could again seek relief based on his 
constitutional right to speedy trial.
