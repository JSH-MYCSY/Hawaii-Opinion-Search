NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
NO. CAAP-22-0000032 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
ROBERTA WILBORN, Defendant-Appellant. 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CRIMINAL NO. 1CPC-19-0000658) 
ORDER GRANTING IN PART MOTION TO DISMISS 
FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and Nakasone, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of the Motion to Dismiss for Lack of 
Appellate Jurisdiction (
Motion), filed by Plaintiff-Appellee 
State of Hawai# i, on April 11, 2022, the papers in support, and 
the record, it appears that we lack jurisdiction over Defendant-
Appellant Roberta Wilborn's (Wilborn) appeal from Case No. 1CPC
-
19-0000658 because the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit court) has not entered a final, appealable order or 
judgment and the appeal is premature. 
Wilborn appears to appeal from the circuit court's 
September 22, 2021 Order Granting Motion for Mental Examination 
to Determine [Wilborn]'s Fitness to Proceed and Penal Responsibility. The circuit court did not certify the order for interlocutory appeal. 
"It is well-settled that the right to appeal is purely 
statutory and exists only when given by some constitutional or statutory provision." Burke v. Cty. of Maui
, 95 Hawai# i 288, 
289, 22 P.3d 84, 85 (2001). There is no statutory right to appeal under Hawaii Revised Statutes chapter 704 when a defendant NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
is ordered to undergo an evaluation to determine fitness to 
proceed or penal responsibility. There is no appealable order or final judgment in the record on appeal. Therefore, this court lacks appellate jurisdiction. 
Further, Nelson W. Goo, Wilborn's court-appointed 
counsel, whom the circuit court did not appoint as standby counsel, has not withdrawn or been discharged from representing Wilborn. See State v. Hirano, 8 Haw. App. 330, 333-36, 802 P.2d 
482, 484-85 (1990). Therefore, Wilborn improperly filed the notice of appeal self-represented. 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the Motion is granted 
in part and the appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, June 6, 2022.
