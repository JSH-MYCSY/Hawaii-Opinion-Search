SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka and McCullen, JJ.) 
Lorence Douglas Lapow
  appeals from the November 15, 
2021 Order For Protection  entered by the Family Court of the 
Second Circuit.  Lapow also challenges the January 7, 2022 order 
denying his motion for reconsideration. We affirm. 1
Stephanie Haddad filed an ex parte petition for a 
temporary restraining order ( TRO) against Lapow on November 2, 
2021. The petition stated they had been in a romantic but non-
intimate, non-sexual relationship.  It alleged: 2
6. The most recent acts of domestic abuse or threats of 
domestic abuse against me are:I have not seen Lauren [sic] in over 14 months —but I am sure he is vandalizing my home. 
1 The Honorable Adrianne N. Heely presided. 
2 Haddad later testified she and Lapow actually had an intimate
relationship. She described it as a casual, sexual relationship. She would see Lapow a "couple times a week" at her house. Haddad couldn't go to Lapow'splace because his girlfriend lived with him. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Oct. 22, 2021 — On this day I was at home and it
was about 5 a.m. and I could hear somethinghitting your [sic] home. I got up and went andI was looking at the camera —I could see afigure of someone throwing things at my home andI believe it to be Lauren. When I went outside I saw someone had thrown inked eggs at my homeand hit my exterior walls. 
Aug. 07, 2021 — It was about 6:30 a.m. and I got
up and went outside — I noticed that someone hadthrown eggs at my home and it hit the exteriorwalls. I counted 5 eggs - I think it was Laurenagain.CONTINUED: 
. . . . 
Jan 26, 2021 — On this day I returned home and Inotice there was roofing nails all over mydriveway and the grass area — I picked them upand counted over 250 of them — I think I [sic]was Lauren that put them on my property. 
Nov. 23, 2020 — It was dawn again and I heard
something being thrown at my windows. 
I went 
outside and found 2 rocks, one came through myscreen door. At this time I had a relationshipwith Lauren and we broke up and went ourseparate ways in September 2020. He has not contacted me — but I feel he is vandalizing myhome. 
A TRO was issued on November 2, 2021.  The order to 
show cause ( OSC) hearing was held on November 15, 2021. Haddad 
testified she began an intimate relationship with Lapow in 
April 2020. They broke up in November 2020. Haddad did not see who threw the rocks on November 23, 2020, who spread the roofing nails on January 26, 2021, or who threw the eggs on August 7, 2021. But she called the police and accused Lapow each time. She offered what she said was a security video of the October 22, 2021 incident. It showed a person throwing things over a fence. The person's face is not visible, but Haddad testified she could tell it was Lapow from his body language and how he moved. The family court admitted the video into evidence over Lapow's objection. The Order for Protection was entered on November 15, 3

2021, after the hearing.4 Lapow moved for reconsideration on 
November 26, 2021. An order denying reconsideration was entered 
on January 7, 2022. This appeal followed. 
Lapow states two points of error: (1) there was no 
foundation for admitting Haddad's security video into evidence; and (2) the family court erred by denying his motion for 
reconsideration. 
(1) Lapow contends the family court erred because 
Haddad did not lay adequate foundation to admit her security 
video — Exhibit 7 — into evidence. Determining whether proper foundation has been established lies within the discretion of the trial court. State v. Luke, 147 Hawai #i 126, 137, 464 P.3d 914, 
925 (App. 2020). 
We review for abuse of discretion. Id. 
For video evidence where no witness actually saw the 
events captured on the video, "adequate foundational facts must be presented to the trial court, so that the trial court can determine that the trier of fact can reasonably infer that the subject matter is what its proponent claims. This standard is, ultimately, the standard articulated under [Hawaii Rules of Evidence ( HRE
)] Rule 901(a)."5 Id. at 139, 464 P.3d at 927 
(cleaned up). 
Haddad testified she had an infrared security system on 
her house. She took video of the October 22, 2021 incident off her security camera. She agreed Exhibit 7 was an accurate copy of what she took off her security footage from that day and that nothing had been changed. The time stamp on the video was October 22, 2021, from 5:01:16 to 5:01:34 a.m. Based on this 
4 The Order for Protection expired on May 15, 2022, but the
collateral consequences  exception to the mootness doctrine applies. Hamilton 
ex rel. Lethem v. Lethem , 119 Hawai# i 1, 11, 193 P.3d 839, 849 (2008). 
5 HRS § 626-1, HRE Rule 901 (2016) provides: 
(a) General provision. The requirement of authentication or
identification as a condition precedent to admissibility issatisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding thatthe matter in question is what its proponent claims.

testimony, the family court acted within its discretion by 
admitting the video into evidence. 
Lapow does not challenge the family court's findings of 
fact. The court found: 
15. [Haddad] is positive it was [Lapow] on the
surveillance video as she knows his walk, his gait, his body
type.[6] 
. . . . 
22. [Lapow] denied throwing rocks at [Haddad]'s residence;
denied putting nails in her driveway and denied throwing
eggs at her house. 
. . . . 30. The court finds [Haddad]'s testimony more credible
than [Lapow]'s testimony. . . . . 32. The court finds that [Haddad] met her burden of
proving that there was an intentional and knowing damage to
[Haddad]'s property, by [Lapow]. The court found [Haddad]'stestimony credible, that she was positive, that the personon the video was [Lapow]. 
. . . . 34. The court also viewed the video and although it was
unable to see the person's face, saw the person was wearing
a hoodie and is of the same build as [Lapow], and found thatsaid person, had knowledge of where to walk, and when toduck from the surveillance, after walking the remote, long,single, dirt road from the highway, and where to damage[Haddad]'s second floor entry way, wall and window area. 
35. The court also finds that the property damage started
immediately following [Lapow] and [Haddad]'s falling out and
continued for the next year, and that the granting of theprotective order is necessary so that acts of domestic abuse"malicious property damage" do not re-occur. 
6 HRE Rule 901 also provides: 
(b) Illustrations. By way of illustration only, and
not by way of limitation, the following are examples ofauthentication or identification conforming with therequirements of this rule: 
. . . . 
(4) Distinctive characteristics and the like. 
Appearance . . . or other distinctivecharacteristics, taken in conjunction withcircumstances.

(Footnotes omitted.) 
The family court applied the correct law to its 
unchallenged findings of fact. 
A ruling supported by the trial 
court's findings and correctly applying the law will not be 
overturned. Est. of Klink ex rel. Klink v. State, 113 Hawai#i 
332, 351, 152 P.3d 504, 523 (2007).
(2) Lapow contends the family court erred by denying 
his motion for reconsideration of the Order for Protection. 
We 
review for abuse of discretion. Amfac, Inc. v. Waikiki Beachcomber Inv. Co. , 74 Haw. 85, 114, 839 P.2d 10, 26 (1992). 
The family court incorrectly concluded Lapow's motion 
was untimely. The Order for Protection was entered on November 15, 2021. Lapow's motion was filed on November 26, 2021. Hawai #i Family Court Rules ( HFCR) Rule 59(e) requires that 
motions for reconsideration be filed within 10 days after entry of the order for which reconsideration is sought. But November 25, 2021 was a state holiday, Thanksgiving Day. HRS § 8-1 (2009). Thus, Lapow's motion was timely filed on November 26, 2021. HFCR Rule 6(a). 
The family court also ruled that Lapow "has not met the 
burden of establishing . . . newly discovered evidence had occurred, pursuant to H.F.C.R. Rule 59(e)[.]" Lapow's motion for reconsideration argued that "the Court made mistaken factual assertions when making its ruling." The memorandum in support didn't offer new evidence or make any arguments that could not have been offered or made during the evidentiary hearing. "The purpose of a motion for reconsideration is to allow the parties to present new evidence and/or arguments that could not have been presented during the earlier adjudicated motion. A motion for reconsideration is not time to relitigate old matters." Amfac , 
74 Haw. at 114, 839 P.2d at 27 (cleaned up). The family court did not abuse its discretion by denying Lapow's motion for reconsideration.
