(CIVIL NO. 1CC181000180) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and Chan, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
jurisdiction over the appeal by self-represented Plaintiff-
Appellant Truman Lee Ketchmark's appeal from the Circuit Court ofthe First Circuit's (Circuit Court) July 21, 2021 "Order of 
Dismissal [Rule 41(b)]" (Dismissal Order) because the Circuit 
Court has not reduced the Dismissal Order to an appealable final 
judgment. Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 641-1(a) (2016); 
Hawai#i 
Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 58; Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai# i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(1994); Price v. Obayashi Hawaii Corp., 81 Hawai# i 171, 176, 914 
P.2d 1364, 1369 (1996) (applying the separate document rule to an 
order dismissing a complaint for want of prosecution). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that case number CAAP-
22-0000438 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
