OF THE STATE OF HAWAI #I
LOLA L. SUZUKI, Claimant-Appellant-Appellant, v.

ST. PAUL TRAVELERS, Insurance Carrier-Appellee-Appellee, and
LORNE K. DIRENFELD, M.D.; GARY N. KUNIHIRO, ESQ.; and

APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEAL BOARD
(CASE NOS. AB 2007-497(S) AND AB 2007-498(S);
DCD NOS. 2-06-14727 AND 2-07-04617)  
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and Chan, JJ.)  
Upon review of the record, it appears we lack appellate
jurisdiction over self-represented Claimant-Appellant-Appellant 
Lola Suzuki's (Suzuki) appeal from the Labor and Industrial 
Relations Appeals Board's (LIRAB) December 28, 2021 "Order 
Granting Employer's Second Amended Motion to Compel Attendance at
Medical Examination; and Denying Claimant's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment" (Order) entered in consolidated LIRAB Case Nos.
AB 2007-497 and AB 2007-498.  
 
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 386-88 (2015) and 91-
14(a) (2012) authorize an aggrieved party to appeal a final 
decision and order by the LIRAB to the this court as follows: 
The appeal of a decision or order of the LIRAB
is governed by HRS § 91-14(a), the statute authorizing
appeals in administrative agency cases. HRS § 91-14(a) authorizes judicial review of a final decisionand order in a contested case or a preliminary rulingof the nature that deferral of review pending entry ofa subsequent final decision would deprive appellant of
adequate relief. For purposes of HRS § 91-14(a), we NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
have defined "final order" to mean an order ending the
proceedings, leaving nothing further to beaccomplished. . . . Consequently, an order is notfinal if the rights of a party involved remainundetermined or if the matter is retained for further action. 
Bocalbos v. Kapiolani Med. Ctr. for Women & Children , 89 Hawai#i 
436, 439, 974 P.2d 1026, 1029 (1999) (cleaned up). However, "an 
order that finally adjudicates a benefit or penalty under the worker's compensation law is an appealable final order under HRS § 91-14(a), although other issues remain." 
Lindinha v. Hilo 
Coast Processing Co.
, 104 Hawai#i 164, 168, 86 P.3d 973, 977 
(2004) (citation omitted). But when a determination of a compensation claim for benefits "has not been made[,] . . . the requisite decree of finality is lacking with respect to th[e] case." Mitchell v. State of 
Hawai#i, Dep't of Educ.
, 77 Hawai#i 
305, 308, 884 P.2d 368, 371 (1994) (citation omitted). 
Here, the Order: 
directs Suzuki to submit to medical 
examinations to ascertain the extent of her purported neck injury, declines to entertain her request for partial summary judgment, and denies her request for sanctions. It does not end the LIRAB proceedings, leaving nothing further to be accomplished, nor does it finally adjudicate any matter of medical and temporary disability benefits. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that case number CAAP-
22-0000044 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai#i, November 3, 2022.
