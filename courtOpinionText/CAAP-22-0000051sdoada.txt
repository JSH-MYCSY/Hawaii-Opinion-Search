Association's Motion for Summary Judgment and Interlocutory 
Decree of Foreclosure, Filed on October 19, 2021 ( Foreclosure 
Decree), and the Judgment (Foreclosure Judgment ) based on the 
Foreclosure Decree, entered pursuant to Hawai ‘i Rules of Civil 
Procedure Rules 54(b) and 58, both filed on January 12, 2022 by 
the Circuit Court of the First Circuit ( circuit court ).1 
Plaintiff/Counterclaim Defendant -Appellee Ewa Villages 
Owners Association ( Ewa Villages ) is a planned community 
association organized under Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) 
Chapter 421J, as well as the Declaration of Covenants, 
Conditions and Restrictions of Ewa Villages Community, and the 
Bylaws of Ewa Villages ( collectively, the Project Documents ). 
The Tautuas own residential property in Ewa Beach , Hawai ‘i 
(Property ) and, in accordance with HRS Chapter 421J and the 
Project Documents , are obligated to pay association dues, 
reimbursable repairs, late fees, attorneys' fees and costs, and 
other assessments to Ewa Villages. The Tautuas owed past -due 
assessments to Ewa Villages, and Ewa Villages filed the February 
2019 Notice of Default and Lien on the Property (2019 Lien ) in 
the Land Court of the State of Hawai ‛i. 
Ewa Villages filed its "Complaint for Foreclosure" 
(Complaint ) in November 2020 , and its Motion for Summary

Judgment and Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure ( Motion) in 
October 2021 . The circuit court granted Ewa Villages ' Motion, 
finding no genuine issue of material fact that there are sums 
"due and owing" by the Tautuas to Ewa Villages, but reserved 
ruling as to the specific amounts . The circuit court ruled that 
it would hold a further hearing to confirm the foreclosure sale, 
at which "the amount of association dues, reimbursable repairs, 
late fees, attorneys' fees and costs, and other assessments owed 
by [the Tautuas] to [Ewa Villages]" would be determined. The 
Tautuas appealed. 
On appeal, the Tautuas contend that the circuit court 
erred in granting summary judgment and the Foreclosure Decree . 
We review the circuit court's grant of summary judgment de novo, 
applying the following standard, 
[S]ummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, 
depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on 
file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there 
is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the 
moving party is entitled to judgment a s a matter of law. A 
fact is material if proof of that fact would have the 
effect of establishing or refuting one of the essential 
elements of a cause of action or defense asserted by the 
parties. The evidence must be viewed in the light most 
favorable to the non-moving party. In other words, we must 
view all of the evidence and inferences drawn therefrom in 
the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and authorities relevant to the arguments advanced, we resolve 
the Tautua s' points of error as follows . 2 
(1) The Tautuas first contend  that the circuit court 
erred in entering summary judgment in Ewa Villages'  favor, and 
granting the Foreclosure Decree,  because Ewa Villages "NEVER 
proved the amounts  owed by the Tautuas as required by HRS  §  667-
19(2), nor [were  the amounts]  even alleged."  
We conclude that Ewa Villages satisfied its initial 
burden on summary judgment.   Ewa Villages submitted a ledger, as 
exhibit 4  to their Motion and authenticated by declaration, 
establishing the Tautuas' default.   The record  also  reflects 3
2 The Tautuas set forth the following points of error: 
1. The Circuit Court Erred in Granting [ Ewa Villages' ] Motion 
for Summary Judgment Because : (A) [Ewa Villages ] NEVER 
proved the amounts owed by the Tautuas as required by HRS § 
667-19(2) [(Supp. 2017) ], nor was it even alleged, (B) 
there was no valid lien that [Ewa Villages ] could foreclose 
upon as the 2019 [L]ien was filed BEFORE the Satisfaction 
of Judgment was filed and AFTER the assessment for 
reimbursable repairs, and (C) [Ewa Villages' ] claimed 
attorneys' fees were not reasonable. 
2. The Circuit Court Erred in Making the [FOF] in Paragraphs 
4, 5 and 7 of its Jan. 12, 2022 [FOF], [COL] and Order 
   . . . . 
3. The Circuit Court Erred in Making the [COL] in Paragraphs C 
and G of its Jan. 12, 2022 [FOF], [COL] and Order . . . . 
3 The Tautua's reliance on Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Fong, 149 
Hawai‛i 249, 488 P.3d 1228 (2021) is misplaced. In Fong, the Hawai ʻi Supreme 
Court found that there were genuine issues of material fact regarding default 
where a bank's ledger showed conflicting evidence of whether the mortgagee 
was current on all required payments at the alleged date of default. Id. at 
253-54, 488 P.3d at 1232 -33. Here, the Tautuas admitted to default , and they 
do not demonstrate how the Ewa Villages' ledger purportedly shows the Tautuas 
made payments to cover all unpaid assessments to their Ewa Villages' account.

that the Tautuas ackn owledged their default. At the hearing on 
the Motion, the Tautuas' counsel did not contest that the 
Tautuas owed "[$] 7534.14" to Ewa Villages, arguing only that 
"the question is how much more do [the Tautuas] owe and how does 
that relate to the satisfaction of judgment." 
The burden then shifted to the Tautuas, and the 
Tautuas did not raise a genuine issue of material fact. The  
Tautuas did not argue in the underlying proceedings that HRS 
§  667-19(2) requires Ewa Villages  to prove a specific  additional  
amount owed, or that Ewa Villages failed to demand payment from the Tautuas. Therefore, those  arguments are waived on appeal. 
See  Ass'n of Apartment  Owners of Wailea Elua v. Wailea Resort 
Co.,  100 
Hawai‘i 97, 107, 58 P.3d 608, 618 (2002) ("Legal issues 
not raised in the trial court are ordinarily deemed waived on appeal.").  
Moreover, t he Tautuas are appealing the entry of the 
Foreclosure Decree , 4 and "[t]he material inquiry relevant to a 
4   It is axiomatic that "foreclosure cases are bifurcated into two 
separately appealable parts." Bank of Am., N.A. v. Reyes -Toledo, 139 Hawa i‛i 
361, 372, 390 P.3d 1248, 1259 (2017) (cleaned up). 
"[T]he decree of 
foreclosure and order of sale are appealable pursuant to HRS § 667 -51(a)(1)  
and (2)."   Id.   All other orders, including,  
Orders confirming sale, deficiency judgments, orders 
directing the distribution of proceeds, and other orders 
issued subsequent to the decree of foreclosure are 
separately appealable pursuant to HRS § 667 -51(a)(2)- (3) 
and therefore fall within the second part of the bifurcated 
proceedings.

foreclosure decree is whether a default occurred, not the amount 
owed." IndyMac Bank v. Miguel , 117 Hawai ‘i 506, 520, 184 P.3d 
821, 835 (App. 2008) (emphasis added). 
Any challenge to the total amount of past-due 
assessments owed is therefore premature. "Our law does not 
burden the foreclosing party with the obligation to prove the 
amount due on the mortgage before the foreclosure sale because 
'a deficiency judgment is rendered only after the sale of the 
mortgaged property.'" HawaiiUSA Fed. Credit Union v. Monalim, 
147 Hawai‘i 33, 49 n.22, 464 P.3d 821, 837 n.22 (2020) (quoting  
Bank of Honolulu, N.A. v. Anderson, 3 Haw. App. 545, 549, 654 
P.2d  1370,  1374  (App. 1982)). "This process does not require a 
court to determine the [total]  amount due on the mortgage before 
granting a decree of foreclosure to the mortgagee." Id.  
(2) The Tautuas next contend that the circuit court 
erred in granting summary judgment because "there was no valid 
lien that [Ewa Villages] could foreclose upon as the 2019 [L]ien 
was filed BEFORE the Satisfaction of Judgment was filed and 
AFTER the assessment for reimbursable repairs ." The Tautuas 
concede that the 2019 Lien is valid as to the stated amount of 
$11,955.14 , but dispute that it includes amounts incurred after 
its date of recordation. The Tautuas appear to contend, on this 
logic, that there is no valid lien for assessments accruing 
6     
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
  
  
   
 
 
 
   
   
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
after the 2019 Lien's recordation, upon which Ewa Villages can 
foreclose. 
Ewa Villages demonstrated that the 2019 Lien , which 
was attached as exhibit 7 to the Motion and authenticated by 
declaration, is for "unpaid amounts assessed by [Ewa Villages] 
as of February 1, 2019 and for all subsequent assessments, 
including all costs, expenses, and attorneys' fees incurred by 
or on behalf of [Ewa Villages] for collecting an y delinquent 
assessments against the Property." The 2019 Lien , therefore , 
includes the "subsequent assessments" that the Tautuas accrued 
after recordation of the lien. 
Moreover, Ewa Villages established that it also has a 
statutory lien for unpaid assessments. See HRS § 421J -10.5(a) 
(Supp. 2012) (stating that "[a]ll sums assessed by the 
association, but unpaid for the share of the assessments 
chargeable to any unit, shall constitute a lien on the unit" and 
further provides that the expiration of a recorded lien "shall 
in no way affect the association's automatic lien that arises 
pursuant to this subsection or the association documen ts."). 
The circuit court , therefore , did not err in 
concluding that there was no genuine issue of material fact 
regarding the existence of a valid lien on the Property, against 
which Ewa Villages could foreclose. We reiterate that, to the 
extent the Tautuas contend there exists a genuine issue as to 
7     
 
 
  
 
  
  
  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the precise amount owed to Ewa Villages, that challenge is 
premature. 
(3) The  Tautuas  lastly contend that  Ewa Villages 
"claimed attorneys'  fees [that] were not reasonable."   "The 
trial court's grant or denial of attorneys' fees and costs is 
reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard." Kamaka v. 
Goodsill Anderson Quinn & Stifel, 117 Hawai ʻi 92, 105, 176 P.3d 
91, 104 (2008) (cleaned up).  
We determine that the circuit court did not abuse its 
discretion in concluding that Ewa Villages is entitled to 
reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to HRS Chapter 421J . See 
HRS § 421J -10(a) (2004) (stating that "[a]ll costs and expenses, 
including reasonable attorneys' fees" for collecting any 
delinquent assessments, foreclosing any lien, or enforcing any 
provision of the association documents or HRS Chapter 421J 
chapter "shall be promptly paid on demand to the a ssociation" ). 
The Tautuas prematurely challenge the fee amount insofar as the 
Foreclosure Decree states the circuit court reserved ruling on 
"the amount of association dues, reimbursable repairs, late 
fees, attorneys' fees and costs, and oth er assessments owed by 
[the Tautuas]" until the confirmation of the foreclosure sale.
