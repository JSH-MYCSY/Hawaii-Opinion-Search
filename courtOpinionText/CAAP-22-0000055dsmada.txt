Hawai# i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 3(a); 
(2)
 On February 23, 2022, the appellate clerk notified 
Pauline to pay the filing fee or file a motion for leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis on or before March 7, 2022, or the appeal could be dismissed; 
(3) The record on appeal was due on or before April 18, 
2022, see HRAP Rule 11(b)(1), but was not filed because Pauline failed to pay the filing fee or obtain a fee waiver; 
(4) On April 26, 2022, the appellate clerk entered a 
default of the record on appeal, informing Pauline that the time to docket the appeal had expired, Pauline had not paid the filing fee or obtained an order allowing him to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis, the matter would be brought to the court's attention on May 6, 2022, for action that may include dismissal NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of the appeal, and Pauline could seek relief from default by 
motion; and 
(5) Pauline has not taken any further action in this 
appeal. An appeal may be dismissed where the record on appeal has not been prepared because the appellant failed to pay the required fees or obtain an order allowing the appellant to proceed in forma pauperis. HRAP Rule 11(b)(2), (c)(2). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are
