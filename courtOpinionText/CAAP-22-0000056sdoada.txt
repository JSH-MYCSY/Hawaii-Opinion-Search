On August 23, 2021, Fay entered into a plea agreement 
with the State. Under the plea agreement, Count 1 was dismissed 
with prejudice; Fay pled no contest to Count 2, OVUII, and the State recommended $250 in fines plus the statutory penalties and fees as a first time OVUII offender; Count 3 was amended to Criminal Property Damage in the Fourth Degree under HRS § 708-823 (2014),
8 with a recommended fine of $100, a payment of 
restitution, and a signature of a freestanding order; and Fay pled no contest to Count 4, NMVI, and the State recommended a $500 fine plus the statutory penalties and fees. 
On January 24, 2022, Fay signed and the District Court 
entered an Order Imposing a Free Standing Order of Restitution 
(Restitution Order), which required her to pay $6,504 at $50 per 
month. The District Court further ordered proof of compliance 
hearings (Compliance Hearings) be held to periodically monitor 
the restitution payments. Fay objected to the Compliance 
Hearings, arguing that once a freestanding order is signed, a district court no longer has jurisdiction over restitution. The

(i) Three months for the first conviction; and
(ii) One year for any subsequent offense within a
five-year period from a previous offense[.] 
8 HRS § 708-823 states: 
§ 708-823 Criminal property damage in the fourth
degree. (1) A person commits the offense of criminal
property damage in the fourth degree if by means other thanfire, the person intentionally or knowingly damages theproperty of another without the other's consent.
(2) Criminal property damage in the fourth degree is a
petty misdemeanor. 
5  Fay raises a single point of error on appeal, asserting 
that the District Court erred in denying Fay's motion to not set 
Compliance Hearings to monitor Fay's payments on the Restitution Order because: (1) the District Court lacks jurisdiction; and (2) the practice of setting unending Compliance Hearings to enforce restitution constitutes an abuse of discretion and a waste of judicial resources, needlessly duplicates the established civil judgment mechanism, and criminalizes individuals who lack the capacity to pay restitution. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Court denied Fay's oral motion objecting to the order for Compliance Hearings and included its rulings in the Amended Judgment. On February 15, 2022, Fay filed a notice of appeal from the Amended Judgment. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve Fay's point of error as follows: 
(1) Fay contends since the enactment of Act 269, 
Session Laws of 1998, which created HRS § 706-646 (2014) and HRS § 706-647 (2014), a free standing order of restitution is civil in nature, and therefore, the criminal courts lack jurisdiction to enforce such an order. Fay submits that because the Legislature intended to allow victims to use civil collection remedies, criminal courts, including the District Court in this 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
case, lack jurisdiction. We conclude that this argument is 
without merit. 
Pursuant to HRS § 604-7(4) (2016),9 a district court 
has the power to enforce judgments. Pursuant to HRS § 706-605(7) (2014),
10 a court has jurisdiction to order a defendant to make 
restitution payments for losses as provided in § 706-646. The Legislature explained its rationale for adding HRS §§ 706-646 and 706-647 as follows: 
The purpose of this bill is to allow victims of crime
to enforce a criminal restitution order in the same manner 
as a civil judgment. This section also includes within the definition of "victim" a governmental entity which hasreimbursed the victim for losses arising as a result of thecrime, and allows the court to order restitution to be paid
to the criminal injuries compensation commission [( CICC)] if
the victim has been given an award for compensation by the
commission. 
Under current law, a defendant may be required by the
court to pay restitution for losses caused to the victim.
Collection of this restitution is left to governmentalentities such as the Judiciary, Public Safety, and ParolingAuthority, which often are able to collect only a smallfraction of the amount. 
There are few other options. Although the CICC helps
victims by providing some compensation, victims of propertycrimes and some violent crimes are not eligible for any 
9 HRS § 604-7(4) (2016), states: 
§ 604-7 Powers; venue.  (a) The district courts may:
. . . . (4) Enforce judgments; and punish contempts
according to law[.] 
10 HRS § 706-605(7) (2014) states: 
§ 706-605 Authorized disposition of convicted
defendants. 
. . . . (7) The court shall order the defendant to make 
restitution for losses as provided in section 706-646. In ordering restitution, the court shall not consider thedefendant's financial ability to make restitution in
determining the amount of restitution to order. The court,
however, shall consider the defendant's financial ability tomake restitution for the purpose of establishing the timeand manner of payment. 
7  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
compensation from the CICC. And although a victim may bring
civil action against the defendant, this process is costlyand time consuming.
Therefore, your Committee on Conference believes that
victims should have a "fast track" ability to be compensatedfor their losses by allowing them to enforce the criminalrestitution order as a civil judgment, using all of the
civil collection remedies. 
Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 89, in 1998 House Journal, at 986, 1998 
Senate Journal, at 780. HRS § 706-644(4) (2014) provides for criminal court enforcement and modification of a restitution order until the restitution is paid.
11 The supplemental 
11 HRS § 706-644(1) provides that a sentencing court may enforce the
payment of restitution imposed "as a part of a judgment and sentence" under
HRS § 706-605(7). HRS § 706-644(1) permits the sentencing court to imposeconsequences for nonpayment of restitution "upon the motion of the prosecutingattorney or upon its own motion[.]" The statute sets forth various consequences in the event of such default, depending on whether default was"contumacious" under subsection (1), or "not contumacious" under subsection(4). Subsection (5) provides an additional avenue for summary collection,where a restitution order imposed "as a part of a judgment and sentence . . .may be collected in the same manner as a judgment in a civil action." 
HRS § 706-644 states, in part: 
§ 706-644 Consequences of nonpayment; imprisonment
for contumacious nonpayment; summary collection.
(1) When a defendant is sentenced pursuant to section
706-605, . . . and the defendant is ordered to pay a fee,fine, or restitution, whether as an independent order, aspart of a judgment and sentence, or as a condition of
probation or deferred plea, and the defendant defaults in
the payment thereof or of any installment, the court, uponthe motion of the prosecuting attorney or upon its ownmotion, may require the defendant to show cause why thedefendant's default should not be treated as contumacious and may issue a summons or a warrant of arrest for thedefendant's appearance. Unless the defendant shows that the defendant's default was not attributable to an intentional refusal to obey the order of the court, or to a failure onthe defendant's part to make a good faith effort to obtainthe funds required for the payment, the court shall findthat the defendant's default was contumacious and may orderthe defendant committed until the fee, fine, restitution, or
a specified part thereof is paid.
. . . . 
(4) If it appears that the defendant's default in the
payment of a fee, fine, or restitution is not contumacious,the court may make an order allowing the defendantadditional time for payment, reducing the amount of eachinstallment, or revoking the fee, fine, or the unpaid

commentary to § 706-644 also explains that Act 269, Session Laws 
1998, amended § 706-644 to "allow victims of a crime to enforce a criminal restitution order in the same manner as a civil judgment." HRS § 706-644 supp. cmt. (2014). The commentary to § 706-644 indicates that the intent of the 1998 amendment was to supplement the existing process of collecting restitution by allowing victims additional methods of enforcement. There is no language anywhere in the statutes or the commentary indicating that the Legislature intended to divest the district courts presiding over criminal cases from jurisdiction over enforcement of restitution orders. In fact, the legislative history quoted 
above clearly demonstrates the intent to offer additional ways for crime victims to be compensated for their losses. Therefore, 
we reject Fay's argument that the District Court lacked post-judgment jurisdiction to enforce its order that Fay pay restitution. 
(2) Fay argues that the ordering of Compliance 
Hearings constitutes an abuse of discretion, citing State v. Gaylord, 78 
Hawai#i 127, 890 P.2d 1167 (1995), and Bearden v. 
Georgia, 461 U.S. 660 (1983). 
11(...continued)
portion thereof in whole or in part, or converting the
unpaid portion of the fee or fine to community service. A defendant shall not be discharged from an order to payrestitution until the full amount of the restitution has actually been collected or accounted for. 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In Gaylord, the Hawai#i Supreme Court held that 
imposing consecutive terms of imprisonment, merely to ensure 
restitution payment, constituted an abuse of discretion. 78 Hawai#i at 154, 890 P.2d at 1194. Fay acknowledges that she "was 
neither sentenced to imprisonment nor probation on the OVUII, CPD4, and [NMVI] charges." Fay nevertheless asserts that were she to miss a Compliance Hearing, a bench warrant would be issued, therefore she could be imprisoned, and thus the principle in Gaylord is triggered. We decline to address such speculation, except to note that this hypothetical bench warrant would be issued because of failure to comply with a court-ordered appearance at a hearing, not because of a failure to pay restitution. 
Fay's reliance on Bearden is equally misplaced. In 
Bearden, the defendant was placed on probation and ordered to pay a fine and restitution that totaled $750. 461 U.S. at 662. Soon after, defendant lost his job and notified the probation officer that his payment would be late. Id. at 662-63. The state then filed a motion to revoke probation and the trial court sentenced him to prison. Id. at 663. In reversing this sentence, the United States Supreme Court explained that if the state determines a fine or restitution is the appropriate and adequate penalty for the crime, it may not thereafter imprison the person solely because he lacked the resources to pay it. Id. at 667-69. 
10 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Here, the State has not sought to revoke probation, and Fay has 
not been sentenced to prison. Bearden does not apply. 
Lastly, Fay argues that Compliance Hearings are a waste 
of judicial resources, criminalize individuals who lack the capacity to pay restitution, and needlessly duplicate the civil judgment mechanism. 
However, as discussed above, the District 
Court has statutory authority to enforce the Free Standing Order, and we cannot conclude that it is a waste of judicial resources or needlessly duplicative for the court to exercise its authority in this manner. Fay offers nothing in support of her contention that Compliance Hearings needlessly criminalize individuals who lack the capacity to pay restitution. We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in ordering Fay to appear at Compliance Hearings.
12 
For these reasons, the District Court's January 24, 
2022 Amended Judgment is affirmed.

12 We note that in its Answering Brief, the State submits that the
District Court's change-of-plea colloquy was deficient. However, as clearly
stated in Fay's Reply Brief, Fay is not seeking relief from the AmendedJudgment on this ground. Therefore, we decline to address it.
