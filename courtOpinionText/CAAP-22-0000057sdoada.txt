APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
WAILUKU DIVISION 
(CASE NO. 2DTA-21-01063) 
  
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: 
Wadsworth, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and Guidry, JJ.) 
This appeal challenges the imposition of a mandatory 
sentence of a substance abuse assessment with recommended 
treatment, and a 14-hour substance abuse rehabilitation program (collectively, substance abuse treatment penalties
), for a 
conviction for Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), without the imposition of probation. The

challenge relies on State v. Agdinaoay, 150 Hawaiʻ i 223, 500 P.3d 
408 (2021) (overturned due to legislative action).1 We affirm. 
Defendant-Appellant Dale K. Wilson ( ) appeals 
from the February 2, 2022 Judgment and Notice of Entry of 
Judgment (Judgment
), entered by the District Court of the Second 
Circuit (District Court).  Wilson pled guilty to OVUII pursuant 
to a plea agreement with Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawaiʻ i 
(State). Over his objection based on  Agdinaoay, Wilson was 
sentenced, inter alia, to the substance abuse treatment penalties under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61.

1 In Agdinaoay , the Hawaiʻi Supreme Court held that the defendant 
could not be sentenced to a domestic violence intervention program ( DVI) with 
imprisonment because, inter alia, DVI was available only as part of a 
probation sentence. 150 Hawaiʻ i at 225, 500 P. 3d at 410. 
2 The Honorable Blaine J. Kobayashi presided. 
3 The OVUII statute, HRS § 291E- 61 (2020 & 2021 Supp.), mandates 
the imposition of the following substance abuse treatment penalties in 
subsections (b) and (h), without probation: 
(b) A person committing the offense of [OVUII]  shall 
be sentenced without possibility of probation  or suspension 
of sentence as follows:  
 . . . . 
(A) A fourteen- hour minimum substance abuse 
rehabilitation program, including education and counseling, 
or other comparable programs deemed appropriate by the 
court;  
 . . . . 
(h) Whenever a court sentences a person pursuant to 
subsection (b), it also shall require  that the offender be 
referred to the driver's education program for an  
assessment, by a certified substance abuse counselor  deemed 
appropriate by the court, of the offender's substance abuse 
or dependence and the need for appropriate treatment. The 
counselor shall submit a report with recommendations to the 
court. The court shall require the offender to obtain 
appropriate treatment if the counselor's assessment 
establishes the offender's substance abuse or dependence. 
All costs for assessment and treatment shall be borne by 
the offender.

On appeal, Wilson's sole challenge is to the District 
Court's imposition of the mandatory substance abuse treatment 
penalties under HRS § 291E-61(b) and (h), because "these requirements cannot be imposed except as conditions of probation" under HRS Chapter 706. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve 
Wilson's point of error as follows. 
We preliminarily address the State's arguments that 
Wilson is "judicially estopped" from challenging the sentence on appeal because Wilson "waived" this argument by pleading guilty and due to Wilson's "on-record agreement" that the substance abuse treatment penalties at issue were "possible penalties." These arguments are unpersuasive. 
Here, the record does not reflect that Wilson "waived" 
the ability to challenge his sentence by pleading guilty. It reflects the opposite, that Wilson was "accepting a plea deal, but then doing [sic] an appeal" of the sentencing issue.
4 Nor 
did Wilson "waive" this challenge on appeal by agreeing that the 
penalties at issue were "possible penalties." Agreeing that 
penalties are "possible" does not mean that Wilson agreed to the penalties and gave up his right to challenge them. In fact, the 
(Emphases added.) 
4 The record reflects that at the outset of the February 2, 2022 
sentencing hearing, Wilson told his attorney he would plead, then appeal, as 
follows: 
[Defense Counsel]: Ah, hey, [Wilson], we had talked 
on the phone, ah, about, ah, accepting a plea deal, but 
then doing an appeal of the issue that I raised. Do you want to go ahead and do that today? 
[Wilson]: Yeah. I'd still be willing to do so. 
(Emphasis added.) 
3   
 
   
  
  
 
  
 
   
 
  
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST 'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
record reflects the plea agreement did not require Wilson to 
agree to the substance abuse treatment penalties. The State phrased the plea agreement as including recommended penalties, i.e. that the State would "recommend[] a $500.00 fine and the remaining statutory requirements" in exchange for Wilson's guilty plea. (Emphasis added.) Thus, Wilson is not judicially estopped from, and did not waive his challenge to, the penalties 
at issue. 
We turn to Wilson's point of error. Relying on 
Agdinaoay, Wilson argues that because "[s]ubstance abuse 
treatment is not one of the authorized [sentencing] dispositions of HRS § 706-605[,]"
5 and can only be ordered as a "condition of 
probation" under "HRS § 706-624(2)(j),"6 "it is not possible . . 
. to sentence Wilson to complete substance abuse treatment" under HRS § 291E-61(b), which "expressly prohibits a sentence of probation." 
"Statutory interpretation is a question of law 
reviewable de novo." State v. Castillon, 144 Hawaiʻ i 406, 411, 
443 P.3d 98, 103 (2019) (citation omitted). 
"[T]he fundamental 
starting point for statutory[]interpretation is the language of the statute itself." Id. (citation omitted). 
In 
Agdinaoay, the defendant was sentenced to 181 days 
of imprisonment and to complete DVI, without being sentenced to 
5 HRS § 706- 605 (2014 & 2016 Supp.), entitled "Authorized 
disposition of convicted defendants," provides that a convicted defendant may 
be sentenced to one or more of the following: probation, to pay a fine, 
imprisonment, and/or community service. In 2022, HRS § 706- 605 was amended 
to add DVI, because of the 2021 Agdinaoay decision. 
6 HRS § 706- 624(2)(j) (2014 & 2016 Supp.), entitled "Conditions of 
probation," provides that a court may order "assessment and treatment for substance abuse dependency" as a probation condition.

probation, following a conviction for violation of a temporary 
restraining order (TRO).  The supreme court stated: 7
We hold that courts cannot impose imprisonment 
exceeding the statutory threshold for a probationary 
sentence and also conditions of probation. Because a 
misdemeanor defendant sentenced to imprisonment exceeding 180 days cannot also receive a probationary sentence -and 
DVI cannot be imposed except as a condition of probation -Agdinaoay's sentence was unlawful. 
150 Hawaiʻ i at 225, 500 P.3d at 410.  The supreme court noted the 
plain language of HRS § 706-600 (2014), that "[n]o sentence 
shall be imposed otherwise than in accordance with this chapter[,]" and ruled that "Chapter 706 controls all sentencing dispositions[.]"
8 Id. (emphasis omitted). The supreme court 
explained that Agdinaoay's sentence was illegal because "DVI is 
not available to sentencing courts as a 'standalone' sentencing 
option" under the plain language of HRS § 706-605, and "must be imposed with probation." Id. at 225-26, 500 P.3d at 410-11. 
HRS § 291E-61(b) provides that an OVUII offender 
"shall be sentenced without possibility of probation[.]" Unlike in Agdinaoay, where a probation sentence could be imposed for the TRO violation offense at issue, here, a probation sentence cannot be imposed for an OVUII offense under HRS § 291E-61. HRS § 291E-61 expressly prohibits the imposition of probation, but also requires the substance abuse treatment penalties be imposed. HRS § 291E-61 thus conflicts with HRS § 706-605, because substance abuse treatment is not listed as a 
"standalone" sentencing option. See id. at 226, 500 P.3d at 
411. 
7 The TRO statute in effect at that time, HRS § 586- 4 (2018 & 2021 
Supp.), mandated that a person convicted of a TRO violation "shall undergo" 
DVI. 
8 We note that HRS § 706-6 00 was amended in 2022, and now provides: 
"A sentence shall be imposed in accordance with this chapter, unless 
otherwise provided by applicable law." (Emphasis added.) The previous 
version of the statute was in effect at the time of this case.

"[W]here there is a plainly irreconcilable conflict 
between . . . two statutes" that "cover the same subject matter, 
the one general and the other special, the specific statute will be favored." State v. Kuuku, 61 Haw. 79, 82, 595 P.2d 291, 294 
(1979) (citations omitted). In rejecting the application of this general principle of statutory interpretation, the Agdinaoay court explained: "this principle is a mere tool of 
statutory interpretation designed for use where legislative 
intent is unclear. It does not override or undermine otherwise 
clear legislative intent." 150 Hawaiʻ i at 230, 500 P.3d at 415 
(citations omitted). The 
Agdinaoay court concluded that HRS §§ 
706-600 and 701-102(3)9 are statutes that "direct that all 
sentencing in our state happen in accordance with Chapter 706." 
Id. The court noted: "HRS § 584-6's DVI directive may be 
'specific,' but that specificity does not supersede Chapter 706's comprehensive sentencing framework." Id.
Here, the specific statute, HRS § 291E-61, does not 
merely contain a mandatory sentencing term like the DVI, but goes even further in its specificity, by expressly precluding 
the imposition of probation. This express preclusion of a 
probation sentence is a material and dispositive distinction between the HRS § 291E-61 OVUII statute here, and the HRS § 586-4 TRO violation statute in Agdinaoay. HRS § 291E-61's express preclusion of probation, which would otherwise be required under "Chapter 706's comprehensive sentencing framework[,]" is "clear legislative intent" to require the imposition of the substance abuse treatment penalties outside of the ordinary sentencing framework's requirement of probation to accompany such penalties 
9 HRS § 701-102 was also amended in 2022, which now states in 
pertinent part: "(3) The provisions of chapters 701 through 706 of the Code 
are applicable to offenses defined by other statutes, unless otherwise 
provided by applicable law. "  (Emphasis added.)

under Chapter 706. See id. A contrary interpretation would 
result in an unreasonable, illogical situation –– where a court is never able to sentence a defendant convicted of OVUII to a robust minimum-14-hour substance abuse rehabilitation program, or to complete a substance abuse assessment and recommended treatment –– a result we must avoid. See Matter of Lindner, 
152 Hawaiʻ i 130, 142, 522 P.3d 1117, 1129 (App. 2022) ("A 
statutory interpretation that is rational, sensible, and practicable is preferred to one which is unreasonable, impracticable, inconsistent, contradictory, and illogical." (cleaned up)). 
We conclude the District Court acted within its 
discretion in imposing the mandatory substance abuse treatment penalties under HRS § 291E-61(b)(1)(A), for Wilson's OVUII 
conviction. See State v. Kong, 131 Hawaiʻ i 94, 101, 315 P.3d 
720, 727 (2013) (reviewing sentencing for abuse of discretion). 
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the February 2, 
2022 Judgment, entered by the District Court of the Second 
Circuit.
