NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
MEMORANDUM OPINION 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and Nakasone, JJ.) 
Eileen Marie Winters appeals1 from the January 18, 2022
Final Judgment for Deutsche Bank National Trust Company entered 
by the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit.2  Winters challenges 
the (1) March 23, 2021 order dismissing counts 2-5 of her 
counterclaim; and (2) November 19, 2021 order granting Deutsche 
Bank's motion for summary judgment on its claim for ejectment and 
dismissing counts 1 and 6 of her counterclaim. We vacate the 
Final Judgment in part as to Winters individually and as Trustee 
under that certain unrecorded Revocable Living Trust dated 
August 30, 1993, made by Eileen Marie Winters, and remand for 
further proceedings. 
BACKGROUND 
Deutsche Bank sued Winters and Dale Scott Winters for 
ejectment.
3  The complaint was filed on May 25, 2011. Deutsche 
Bank alleged it had purchased property in Kapa#a, Kaua#i in a 
nonjudicial foreclosure, and sought to eject Winters and Dale 
Scott Winters from the property. Winters answered the complaint. 
She didn't assert a counterclaim. Deutsche Bank filed an amended 
complaint on December 30, 2014. Winters answered the amended 
complaint and didn't assert a counterclaim. 
On October 12, 2020, the circuit court granted Deutsche 
Bank's motion to identify "Eileen Marie Winters, Trustee under 
that certain unrecorded Revocable Living Trust dated August 30, 
1993" as a defendant. 
On November 25, 2020, Winters, as trustee, 
answered and counterclaimed for (1) wrongful nonjudicial 
foreclosure; (2) unfair and deceptive acts and practices in 
1 Winters' notice of appeal was filed on behalf of Winters
individually and as "Trustee under that certain unrecorded Revocable Living
Trust dated August 30, 1993, made by Eileen Marie Winters." 
2 The Honorable Kathleen N.A. Watanabe presided. 
3 Dale Scott Winters isn't a party to this appeal.

violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 480-2 (UDAP); 
(3) rescission under the federal Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. 
§§ 1601 et seq. (TILA); (4) violation of the federal Real Estate 
Settlement Procedures Act, 12 U.S.C. §§ 2601 et seq. (RESPA); 
(5) breach of contract; and (6) quiet title. 
Deutsche Bank moved to dismiss counts 2-5 of the 
counterclaim. The circuit court granted the motion. Deutsche 
Bank then moved for summary judgment on its claim for ejectment 
and on counts 1 (wrongful foreclosure) and 6 (quiet title) of 
Winters' counterclaim. The circuit court granted the motion. 
The Final Judgment was entered. This appeal followed. Winters 
contends the circuit court erred by granting Deutsche Bank's 
motion to dismiss and motion for summary judgment. 
STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
We review the circuit court's ruling on the motion to 
dismiss de novo. Bank of Am., N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 143 Hawai#i 
249, 256, 428 P.3d 761, 768 (2018). 
We assume the facts alleged 
in the counterclaim are true and view them in the light most 
favorable to Winters to see if they warrant relief under any 
legal theory. See id. at 256-57, 428 P.3d at 768-69. 
We review the grant of summary judgment de novo. 
Nozawa v. Operating Engineers Local Union No. 3
, 142 Hawai#i 331, 
338, 418 P.3d 1187, 1194 (2018). Deutsche Bank had the burden to 
establish the material facts, show there is no genuine issue as 
to any of them, and explain why it is entitled to a judgment as a 
matter of law. 
Id.
 at 342, 418 P.3d at 1198. A fact is material

DISCUSSION 
1. The circuit court erred by dismissing
counterclaim counts 2-5. 
Counts 2-5 of Winters' counterclaim alleged UDAP, 
violation of TILA and RESPA, and breach of contract. It made 
these allegations which, for this appeal, we deem true and view 
in the light most favorable to Winters: 
Winters created her revocable living trust (
RLT) in 
2002 and transferred title to her Kapaa#  home to herself as 
trustee. If she were the RLT's beneficiary, she would be the 
real party in interest to assert claims affecting ownership of 
and title to her home. 
Tradewinds Hotel, Inc. v. Cochran
, 8 Haw. 
App. 256, 265, 799 P.2d 60, 66 (1990) (noting general rule that a 
trustee having the right sought to be enforced is the real party 
in interest). She refinanced debt in 2006 and signed a mortgage, 
but the mortgage did not say she was a trustee.
4  The lender, 
Fremont, failed to deliver two completed and signed notice-of-
right-to-cancel documents at the closing, as required under TILA. 
In February 2008 Fremont informed Winters her loan was 
being transferred to Wells Fargo and she would receive written 
instructions for making future payments. Winters called Wells 
Fargo for payment instructions. She was informed Wells Fargo did 
not own her loan. Winters called Fremont and was told to make 
her March 2008 payment over the phone. She did. That happened 
again in April 2008. In May 2008 Fremont told Winters it was 
closing and would not accept further payment. 
In June 2008 Litton informed Winters it was the new 
loan servicer, Wells Fargo owned her loan, she was in default, 
and she needed to call to get the payoff amount. Winters left 
messages at the phone number she was given, but never received a 
return call. In August 2008 she contacted Litton. She signed a 
4 The mortgage identified the "Borrower" as "Dale Scott Winters and
Eileen Marie Winters, husband and wife, as tenants by the entirety." We 
express no opinion about the legal effect of the failure to identify Winters
as trustee of her RLT in the mortgage.

NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Repayment Plan Agreement on August 27, 2008, and wired the 
required $5,000 initial payment. A few days later, Litton 
informed her it was proceeding with a foreclosure and keeping her 
initial payment because it was $100 less than required. Litton 
also force-placed property insurance on the Kapa#a property and 
charged the premium to Winters' loan, even though the property 
was insured. Litton verbally quoted a reinstatement amount, but 
never verified it in writing. Litton also told Winters to apply 
for a loan modification, which Winters did by fax. 
Meanwhile, Litton's foreclosure counsel sent a letter 
telling Winters if she wanted to dispute the debt she must do so 
in writing by December 17, 2008. On December 16, 2008, Winters 
faxed and mailed a letter disputing the debt and requesting an 
accounting and the name of the original creditor. She never 
received the information, in violation of RESPA. In January 2009 
Litton informed Winters her house would be sold at auction in 
March. Winters called Litton's counsel, requested a payoff 
number and an accounting, and followed up in writing. Litton's 
counsel told Winters her house was scheduled for auction in two 
weeks. 
By letter dated January 10, 2009, Litton informed 
Winters her loan could not be modified. In early February 2009 
Litton told Winters it had no record of receiving loan 
modification documents, and she should resubmit. In late 
February 2009, Litton's counsel gave Winters a written 
reinstatement amount that was "almost double any previous 
quote[.]" On June 24, 2009, Winters exercised her TILA 
rescission right. She received no response. Deutsche Bank 
proceeded with a nonjudicial foreclosure, sold Winters' house to 
itself, and recorded a quitclaim deed on August 30, 2010. 
Deutsche Bank's motion to dismiss argued that Winters 
lacked standing to assert the UDAP, TILA, RESPA, and breach of 
contract claims because they were based on loan documents she 
signed individually, not as trustee of her RLT. Deutsche Bank 
alternatively argued the claims were time-barred. 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(a) Count 2 alleged UDAP. A UDAP claim may only be 
brought by a consumer. HRS § 480-2(d) (2008). A "consumer" is 
"a natural person who, primarily for personal, family, or 
household purposes, purchases, attempts to purchase, or is 
solicited to purchase goods or services or who commits money, 
property, or services in a personal investment." HRS § 480-1 
(2008). 
Deutsche Bank argues Winters' RLT is not a "natural 
person," citing Association of Apartment Owners of Newtown 
Meadows v. Venture 15, Inc.
, 115 Hawai#i 232, 252, 167 P.3d 225, 
245 (2007) (holding that unincorporated association is not 
"consumer" under HRS § 480–1). But a trust is not comparable to 
an unincorporated association; it is an instrument creating a 
relationship. HRS § 554A-1 (2018, repealed, 2021 Haw. Sess. Laws 
Act 32, § 9 at 92); HRS § 554D-1104 (Supp. 2021). The 
counterclaim alleged Winters was the trustee holding title to her 
Kapa#a home under her RLT when the loan documents, including the 
mortgage that encumbered the home, were executed. If she were 
also the RLT's beneficiary, she would be the real party in 
interest and have standing to maintain a UDAP claim for unfair or 
deceptive acts and practices that affected her ownership of and 
title to her home. 
Cf. Cochran
, 8 Haw. App. at 265, 799 P.2d at 
66. 
Winters' UDAP claim was not time-barred. A consumer 
suit under HRS § 480-13(b) (2008) must be filed "within four 
years after the cause of action accrues[.]" HRS § 480-24 (Supp. 
2016). The last unfair or deceptive act or practice alleged in 
the counterclaim was the recording of Deutsche Bank's quitclaim 
deed on August 30, 2010. A UDAP action had to have been filed by 
August 30, 2014. Winters' counterclaim wasn't filed until 
November 25, 2020. But Winters argues her counterclaim relates 
back to May 25, 2011, when Deutsche Bank's complaint was filed. 
(a) In the cases enumerated in subsection (b), . . . any
. . . statute of limitations, shall apply to a claim stated
as a counterclaim against an opposing party in the same
manner as if an action thereon had been commenced at the 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
time when the opposing party commenced the opposing party's
action . . . . 
(b) Subsection (a) shall apply if the claim stated
as a counterclaim: 
. . . . 
(2) Arises out of the transaction or occurrence that 
is the subject matter of the opposing party's
claim. 
HRS § 657-3 (2016). 
Deutsche Bank argues that "counterclaims, as with all 
other claims, will relate back only if they arose out of a 
situation previously described in timely pleadings." Mauian 
Hotel, Inc. v. Maui Pineapple Co.
, 52 Haw. 563, 567, 481 P.2d 
310, 313–14 (1971) (applying Hawai#i Rules of Civil Procedure 
Rule 15(c)). Deutsche Bank's complaint sought ejectment. But it 
alleged that Deutsche Bank sold Winters' property to itself in a 
nonjudicial foreclosure, and that Winters and Dale Scott Winters 
were "remaining on the property as trespassers and/or uninvited 
guests and lessees." Thus, Winters' mortgage loan, alleged 
default, and the nonjudicial foreclosure were "situation[s] 
previously described" in, and the UDAP counterclaim "ar[ose] out 
of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter" of, 
Deutsche Bank's complaint. 
It was reasonably foreseeable that Winters would defend 
against the ejectment claim by challenging the validity of the 
nonjudicial foreclosure. 
Deutsche Bank realized this; its motion 
for summary judgment stated it "commenced this action in May 2011 
to confirm the validity of the nonjudicial foreclosure and obtain 
a writ of ejectment." The complaint was filed before Winters' 
UDAP counterclaim, which relates back, became time-barred. The 
circuit court erred by dismissing count 2.
(b) Count 3 alleged TILA violations. Deutsche Bank 
doesn't argue Winters lacked standing; it argues only that her 
TILA claim was time-barred. TILA does not contain its own 
statute of limitations. "In the absence of a controlling federal 
limitations period, the general rule is that a state limitations 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
period for an analogous cause of action is borrowed and applied 
to the federal claim[.]" Cnty. of Oneida v. Oneida Indian 
Nation, 470 U.S. 226, 240 (1985). 
HRS § 657-1(1), the six-year breach-of-contract statute 
of limitations, is the most analogous. Cf. Hoang v. Bank of Am., 
N.A., 910 F.3d 1096, 1099 (9th Cir. 2018) ("In Washington, the 
state's six-year contract statute of limitations is the most 
analogous statute."). The counterclaim alleged Winters exercised 
her TILA rescission right on June 24, 2009, but the nonjudicial 
foreclosure proceeded. Deutsche Bank's complaint was filed 
before Winters' TILA rescission claim became time-barred. The 
circuit court erred by dismissing count 3.
(c) Count 4 alleged RESPA violations. Deutsche Bank 
argues the RLT was not a "borrower" authorized to sue under RESPA 
because Winters signed the loan documents individually, not as 
trustee. 12 U.S.C. § 2605(f) ("Whoever fails to comply with any 
provision of this section shall be liable to the borrower for 
each such failure[.]"). 
Deutsche Bank relies on Keen v. Helson, 930 F.3d 799, 
802 (6th Cir. 2019). Keen is inapposite. There, Tara and Nathan 
Keen bought a house. Both signed the mortgage, but only Nathan 
signed the note. Tara got title to the house when they divorced. 
Nathan died. The loan servicer foreclosed. Tara sued the loan 
servicer for violating RESPA. The federal district court held 
that Tara was not a "borrower" under RESPA because she was never 
personally obligated under the note. Tara appealed. The Sixth 
Circuit affirmed, holding that a "'borrower' is someone who is 
personally obligated on a loan — i.e., someone who is actually 
borrowing money. Tara Keen does not fit that description, so she 
does not have a cause of action under RESPA." Id. at 800. 
Here, Winters was the borrower. Her counterclaim 
alleged she owned her home as trustee of her RLT when she signed 
the note. She had standing as RLT trustee to assert the RESPA 
violation on behalf of herself as the real party in interest. 
Cf. Cochran, 8 Haw. App. at 265, 799 P.2d at 66. 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
RESPA has a three-year statute of limitations for 
violations involving servicing a mortgage loan. 12 U.S.C. 
§ 2614. The counterclaim alleged RESPA violations in June, 
October, and December 2008. Deutsche Bank's complaint was filed 
before the earliest RESPA claim became time-barred. The circuit 
court erred by dismissing count 4.
(d) Count 5 alleged breach of the Repayment Plan 
Agreement. Deutsche Bank argues the RLT was not a party to the 
agreement because it was not a signatory. Winters signed the 
Repayment Plan Agreement as the real party in interest under the 
RLT. Deutsche Bank does not argue the breach of contract claim 
was time-barred. The circuit court erred by dismissing count 5. 
2. The circuit court erred by granting summary
judgment on Deutsche Bank's ejectment claim. 
To prevail on its ejectment claim, Deutsche Bank had to 
prove it had "title to and right of possession of" the Kapa#a 
property. Kondaur Cap. Corp. v. Matsuyoshi
, 136 Hawai#i 227, 
241, 361 P.3d 454, 468 (2015). In 
Kondaur the supreme court 
noted: "Because the title to the Property deeded by RLP to 
Kondaur derives from a non-judicial foreclosure sale of the 
Property, the strength and validity of Kondaur's title is 
unavoidably intertwined with the validity of the foreclosure 
sale." Id. at 241, 361 P.3d at 468. Deutsche Bank submitted the 
Adjustable Rate Note, the Mortgage, and recorded copies of the 
Mortgagee's Affidavit of Foreclosure Under Power of Sale and 
Quitclaim Deed. The burden then shifted to Winters to show there 
were genuine issues of material fact precluding summary judgment. 
The Mortgage provided: 
20. Sale of Note; Change of Loan Servicer; Notice of
Grievance. . . . If there is a change of the Loan Servicer,
Borrower will be given written notice of the change which
will state the name and address of the new Loan Servicer,
the address to which payments should be made and any other
information RESPA requires in connection with a notice of
transfer of servicing. 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Winters submitted a 15-page declaration explaining in 
more detail the facts alleged in her counterclaim. She also 
submitted copies of correspondence she received from Litton, the 
Repayment Plan Agreement, and $5,000 check to "Litton Mortgage," 
a Litton billing statement, correspondence with Litton and its 
foreclosure counsel, her December 16, 2008 letter disputing the 
debt, Litton's call logs, another 2-page declaration, and her 
June 24, 2009 TILA rescission letter. 
Viewed in the light most favorable to Winters, her 
evidence raised genuine issues of material fact about Fremont's, 
Litton's, and Deutsche Bank's breach of paragraph 20 of the 
Mortgage; violation of 12 U.S.C. § 2605 and 12 C.F.R. § 1024.33 
(concerning mortgage servicing transfers); whether Litton and 
Deutsche Bank breached the Repayment Plan Agreement; whether 
Litton and Deutsche Bank violated 12 U.S.C. § 2605 (concerning 
force-placed insurance); and whether Litton and Deutsche Bank 
violated former HRS § 667-5(c) (Supp. 2008) (concerning right to 
cure a default). If proven, the breach and violations could 
invalidate the foreclosure, and thus should have precluded 
summary judgment for Deutsche Bank on its ejectment claim. 
3. The circuit court erred by granting summary
judgment on Winters' wrongful foreclosure
counterclaim. 
Deutsche Bank argues that Winters' wrongful foreclosure 
claim lacked merit because she failed to establish actual damages 
under the holding of Lima v. Deutsche Bank National Trust 
Company
, 149 Hawai#i 457, 494 P.3d 1190 (2021). In 
Lima the 
supreme court addressed this question, certified from the federal 
district court: 
When (a) a borrower has indisputably defaulted on a mortgage
for real property, (b) a lender has conducted a nonjudicial
foreclosure sale but has not strictly complied with the
requirements governing such sales, and (c) the borrower sues
the lender over that noncompliance after the foreclosure
sale and, if the property was purchased at foreclosure by
the lender, after any subsequent sale to a third-party
purchaser, may the borrower establish the requisite harm for 
10 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
liability purposes under the law of wrongful foreclosure
and/or section 480-2 of Hawai#i Revised Statutes by
demonstrating the loss of title, possession, and/or
investments in the property without regard to the effect of
the mortgage on those items? 
Id. at 460, 494 P.3d at 1193 (emphasis added). The supreme court 
held that "a borrower with no pre-foreclosure rights in property 
except as encumbered by a mortgage bears the burden of accounting 
for the effect of the mortgage in establishing the element of 
harm." Id. at 469, 494 P.3d at 1202. 
Winters argues that Lima is distinguishable because 
there, the borrowers had no pre-foreclosure rights in property 
except as encumbered by a mortgage, while Winters contends "she 
absolutely had pre-foreclosure rights in the property, including 
the right to make monthly payments towards her debt under the 
mortgage loan, which she absolutely could do." Her opening brief 
asserts: "She is not asking for a free house, release of 
mortgage, or to be excused from her obligations under the 
mortgage loan contract. Instead, she is asking that her rights 
under the parties' contract be upheld." 
A supreme court case decided after briefing was 
completed lends credence to her argument. In Llanes v. Bank of 
Am., N.A., 154 
Hawai#i 423, 555 P.3d 110 (2024), several 
borrowers sued their lenders for nonjudicial foreclosures that 
didn't comply with statutory requirements. The foreclosed 
properties were sold to third parties. Id. at 426, 555 P.3d at 
113. Discussing Lima, the supreme court explained: 
Accounting for the effect of the mortgage in
establishing the element of harm means . . . factoring in
the mortgage's value[.] This reading comports with the
general rule in measuring damages, which is to give a sum of
money to the person wronged which as nearly as possible,
will restore him or her to the position he or she would be
in if the wrong had not been committed. . . . 
Moreover, under Borrowers' own theory, they did not
walk away empty-handed — their initial "invested debt" was
returned to them on the backend when it was forgiven. The 
satisfaction of Borrowers' mortgage debts, which they do not
contest here, represents a return of their "investment" on
their own theory. If the "invested debt" was theirs on the 
front end, it was also theirs on the backend. 
11 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Id. at 432-33, 555 P.3d at 119-20 (cleaned up). 
The supreme court contrasted the facts in Llanes and 
Lima with those in Santiago v. Tanaka, 137 Hawai#i 137, 366 P.3d 
612 (2016). 
There, the Santiagos bought a tavern from Tanaka 
with a purchase money mortgage that did not contain a power of 
sale. Tanaka had misrepresented the tavern's sewer costs during 
negotiations. The Santiagos initially withheld payments from 
Tanaka after discovering the sewer fees, but later cured their 
default. Four months later, Tanaka sold the tavern to herself in 
a nonjudicial foreclosure, then resold it to a third party. In 
Llanes the supreme court summarized its Santiago decision: 
We held that Tanaka improperly foreclosed upon the
Santiagos' tavern because (1) her misrepresentations and
non-disclosures induced the Santiagos to purchase the
tavern, (2) the mortgage altogether lacked a power of sale,
and (3) the Santiagos cured their default. Because the 
tavern could not be returned to the Santiagos, having been
resold, we concluded that they were entitled to
out-of-pocket losses of $1,412,790.79 as a result of the
seller's wrongful foreclosure of the mortgage and subsequent
sale of the tavern. 
. . . . 
Here [in Llanes], Borrowers were in different pre-
foreclosure positions than were the Santiagos for two
reasons. First, Lender had the right to foreclose upon
their properties under powers of sale. Thus, their pre-tort
position still includes a looming foreclosure. Second,
Borrowers were not current on their mortgages. Thus, to the
extent that they were improper at all, the foreclosures at
issue here appear from the record to have been merely
procedurally defective. Indeed, the circuit court noted in
its summary judgment order that Borrowers claim that Lender
conducted the foreclosures in a wrongful manner by not
complying with the technical requirements of the nonjudicial
foreclosure statute and power of sale, instead of claiming
that the foreclosures were wrongful because they should not
have happened at all. 
Llanes, 154 Hawai#i at 430, 431, 555 P.3d at 117, 118 (cleaned 
up). 
Here, Winters' declaration — which we must view in the 
light most favorable to her — showed that the nonjudicial 
foreclosure was not "looming." It would not have happened but 
for Fremont's, Litton's, and Deutsche Bank's alleged breach of 
12 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
paragraph 20 of the Mortgage, statutory violations, and alleged 
breach of the Repayment Plan Agreement. Winters' declaration 
states that she tried to timely pay what she was told she owed, 
even incurring pay-by-phone and Western Union fees to do so, and 
had "the ability to pay the reinstatement charges if we could 
ever get an exact amount in writing." Thus, as in Llanes, 
assuming Winters' allegations are true "the foreclosures were 
wrongful because they should not have happened at all." 154 
Hawai#i at 431, 555 P.3d at 118. 
In addition, in Llanes and Lima, the mortgaged 
properties had been sold to good-faith purchasers. The 
foreclosure sales, even if wrongful, could not be set aside and 
the borrowers could not recover their properties. Wilmington 
Sav. Fund Soc'y, FSB v. Domingo, 155 Hawai#i 1, 10, 556 P.3d 347, 
356 (2024) (noting that "vacatur or reversal of a foreclosure 
judgment cannot affect title conveyed to the good faith 
purchaser"). 
But the borrowers' loan debts were also discharged. 
That is why they had to account "for the effect of the mortgage 
in establishing the element of harm." Lima, 149 Hawai#i at 469, 
494 P.3d at 1202. 
Here, the record does not show that Deutsche Bank sold 
the Kapa#a property to a third party. If Winters succeeded in 
invalidating the foreclosure, she could regain the property. 
Llanes
, 154 Hawai#i at 434, 555 P.3d at 121. She would still be 
liable to repay her mortgage loan, but she would be entitled to 
some recovery under "the general rule in measuring damages, which 
is to give a sum of money to the person wronged which as nearly 
as possible, will restore . . . her to the position . . . she

4. The circuit court erred by granting summary
judgment on Winters' quiet title claim. 
Deutsche Bank argued to the circuit court that Winters 
had to allege she paid, or tendered, what she owed on her 
mortgage loan to maintain her quiet title counterclaim, citing 
Delapinia v. Nationstar Mortg. LLC, 146 Hawai#i 218, 228, 458 
P.3d 929, 939 (App. 2020) (Delapinia I), vacated in part by 
Delapinia v. Nationstar Mortg. LLC, 150 Hawai#i 91, 497 P.3d 106 
(2021) (Delapinia II). 
A week before the hearing on Deutsche Bank's motion for 
summary judgment, the supreme court decided Delapinia II. There, 
it "decline[d] to opine whether the tender rule applies in 
Hawai#i wrongful foreclosure cases generally." 150 Hawai# i
  at 92, 
497 P.3d at 107. It then held "that the tender rule is not an 
absolute bar to a quiet title action against a party to whom the 
plaintiff is not indebted[.]" Id. at 100, 497 P.3d at 115.

Winters cited Delapinia II to the circuit court in a supplemental 
memorandum the day the supreme court's opinion was filed. 
Deutsche Bank's reply memorandum did not argue why the tender 
rule should be applied despite Delapinia II. Nor does its 
answering brief. 
A quiet title action "may be brought by any person 
against another person who claims, or who may claim adversely to 
the plaintiff, an estate or interest in real property, for the 
purpose of determining the adverse claim." HRS § 669-1(a) 
(2016). "Hawai# i case law explicitly provides that a plaintiff 
seeking relief under HRS Chapter 669 must demonstrate that he or 
she has title to the land, either via paper title or adverse 
possession, and that he or she has superior title compared to the 
defendant." Ibbetson v. Kaiawe
, 143 Hawai#i 1, 17, 422 P.3d 1, 
17 (2018). Deutsche Bank incorrectly argues that Winters' quiet 
title claim "was premised solely upon alleged defects in the

wrongful nonjudicial foreclosure.

foreclosure process." Winters actually claimed her default was 
caused by Fremont's, Litton's, and Deutsche Bank's breach of 
paragraph 20 of the Mortgage, statutory violations, and Litton's 
and Deutsche Bank's breach of the Repayment Plan Agreement, and 
the nonjudicial foreclosure was wrongful because it should not 
have happened. Deutsche Bank did not show why the tender rule 
should apply under these circumstances. On this record, the 
circuit court erred by granting summary judgment for Deutsche 
Bank on Winters' quiet title claim. 
CONCLUSION 
We vacate the circuit court's March 23, 2021 order 
granting Deutsche Bank's motion for partial dismissal of Winters' 
counterclaim; November 19, 2021 order granting Deutsche Bank's 
motion for summary judgment; and January 18, 2022 Final Judgment, 
all as against Winters individually and as Trustee under that 
certain unrecorded Revocable Living Trust dated August 30, 1993, 
made by Eileen Marie Winters, and remand for further proceedings 
consistent with this memorandum opinion.
