APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 5CC111000093) NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION 
(By: Nakasone, Chief Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Upon review of the Motion for Reconsideration filed by
Deutsche Bank National Trust Company on June 5, 2025, the papers 
in support, the response filed by Eileen Winters on June 20, 
2025, and the record, it appears that: 
1. Deutsche Bank moves for reconsideration of our 
May 19, 2025 Memorandum Opinion; and 
2. The motion presents no point of law or fact we 
overlooked or misapprehended. See Rule 40(b), Hawai#i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion for 
Reconsideration is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai#i, July 11, 2025.
