APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 1CC121002576) 
 
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka and McCullen, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Ji Won Keeley appeals from the 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit's January 28, 2022 "Judgment 
on Order Granting Renewed Motion for Judgment by Default" 
(January 28, 2022 Judgment).

This is the second appeal before this court. In the 
first appeal, a majority of the court affirmed the clerk's entry 
of default but vacated the final judgment and entry of default 
judgment by the clerk. Ziemlak v. Keeley (Ziemlak I), 140 
Hawai‘i 19, 396 P.3d 1157, No. CAAP-14-0001017, 2017 WL 2829277, 
at *4 (App. June 30, 2017) (SDO). 
The majority vacated the 
default judgment because a judicial determination was necessary 
on damages "for a sum certain." Ziemlak I, 2017 WL 2829277, at 
*3. 
The case was thus remanded to determine damages. 
On remand, the circuit court calculated the damages as 
follows: 
A. Purchase of North Carolina Property   $169,900.00  
    Less: 5% of Trust Principal Value    -22,828.95  
       147,071.05  
B. Sale Proceeds of North [Carolina] Property $268,705.34  
    Less: Purchase of NC Property Amount -169,900.00  
    Less: Annual Withdrawal of Principal -5,000.00  
          93,805.34  
C. $100,000 Check made payable to [ Stanley]  $100,000.00  
    F. Ziemlak as Trustee of the Marguerite 
    M. Ziemlak Revocable Living Trust 
    Less: 5% of Trust's Principal Value -14,333.95  
          85,666.05  
D. Sub- Total       $326,542.44  
 
E. Legal Rate 10% Interest from January 24, $261,233.95  
    2013, the date of the Entry of Default  
    [Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) §  478-2(3)  
(2008 & Supp. 2024)]  
F. Sub- Total            $587,776.39

On appeal, Keeley challenges (1) the effective 
assistance of counsel (point of error (
POE) 1); (2) the denial 
of her August 6, 2020 Motion to Dismiss for failure to prosecute 
(POE 7); and (3) the damages awarded (POE 10).   3
3 Keeley actually raises ten points of error (POE), summarized as 
follows: 
1. By failing to file an application for writ of 
certiorari, former counsel "deprived Mrs. Keeley of
actual meritorious defenses she possessed; and was 
therefore not very effective assistance of counsel,
for that very reason in this case." 
2. The "Motion to add FIRST HONOLULU SECURITIES, INC., 
whom Plaintiff named in the complaint but refused to 
serve was erroneously denied." 
3. The circuit court erred in denying Keeley's counter 
motion for summary judgment. 
4. "Any order of Default [Judgment] should also apply to
Defendant FIRST HONOLULU SECURITIES, INC." as "they
are the only ones that can be sued for violating the 
trust[.]" 
5. Plaintiff failed to "serve the Personal 
representative of the deceased Stanley Ziemlak[.]" 
6. The circuit court erred in granting in part and 
denying in part Plaintiff-Appellee Thaddeus Ziemlak's 
motion to strike the January 2, 2022 counterclaim. 
7. The circuit court erred in denying Keeley's August 6,
2020 Motion to Dismiss. 
8. The circuit court erred "when it ignored her Defenses 
to suit under the Trust Language itself." 
9. The circuit court erred "in interpreting and applying 
the actual written Trust Articles in the case[.]" 
10. "The [Judgment] amount of $740,628.76 is erroneously
computed and excessive, given the debt itself stems
from claims of improper withdrawals of $165,000 and 
$100,000 from the Stanley Ziemlak trust . . . ." 
(Formatting altered.) Two POE were labeled "5" and, thus, the POE are 
consecutively renumbered following POE 5. 
(continued . . .)

NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve the 
points of error as discussed below and affirm. 
(1) First, Keeley contends her former counsel failed 
to file a writ of certiorari from this court's decision in 
Ziemlak I "and was therefore not very effective assistance of 
counsel[.]" 
The denial of effective assistance of counsel is 
usually raised in the context of a criminal defendant's sixth 
amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. U.S. Const. 
amend. VI; Haw. Const. art. I, 
§ 14. Failure to file a timely 
application for writ of certiorari implicates a criminal 
defendant's constitutional right to effective assistance of 
counsel. State v. Uchima, 147 Hawai‘ i 64, 83, 464 P.3d 852, 871 
(2020). 
However, the "sixth amendment right to counsel applies 
only to criminal proceedings." Norton v. Admin. Dir. of Ct., 80 
(. . . continued) 
POE  2-6, 8, and 9  challenge decisions related to Keeley's  attempt to 
relitigate  her liability arising from  the entry of default, which was 
affirmed  in Ziemlak I.  See  Kam Fui Tr. v. Brandhorst, 77 Hawai‘i 320, 324-25, 
884 P.2d 383, 387-88 (App. 1994) (explaining that an entry of default is an 
"interlocutory order of the court, the effect of which is to preclude the 
defendant from making any further defense in the case so far as liability is
concerned"). 
As such, we do not address these points.    
4 
 Finally, we note that Keeley's reply  brief exceeds the page limit, 
failing  to comply with Hawaiʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP)  Rule 28 (a).    
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawai‘i 197, 200, 908 P.2d 545, 548 (1995). 
Because this case is 
not a criminal case and Keeley is not a criminal defendant, a 
criminal defendant's constitutional right to effective 
assistance of counsel does not apply to Keeley. 
Keeley also relies on 
Hawai‘i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 2, which allows this court to suspend HRAP 
rules to expedite a decision or for good cause shown: 
In the interest of expediting a decision, or for 
other good cause shown, either Hawai‘i appellate court may
suspend the requirements or provisions of any of these 
rules in a particular case on application of a party or on
its own motion and may order proceedings in accordance with 
its direction. 
Keeley, however, does not identify the rule she wishes 
we suspend. These circumstances do not establish grounds for 
vacating the circuit court's January 28, 2022 Judgment. 
(2) Keeley also contends the circuit court erred in 
denying her August 6, 2020 Motion to Dismiss for lack of 
prosecution under Hawai‘i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) 
Rule 41(b). 
Under HRCP Rule 41(b)(1), an action may be 
involuntarily dismissed "[f]or failure of the plaintiff to 
prosecute or to comply with these rules or any order of the 
court[.]" 
"What constitutes a failure to prosecute depends on 
the facts of each case and the court must consider all pertinent 
5   
 
 
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
circumstances before granting the motion." Ellis v. Harland
Bartholomew & Assocs., 1 Haw. App. 420, 426, 620 P.2d 744, 748 
(App. 1980). Courts apply four criteria in ruling on a 
Rule 41(b) motion: "1) the [plaintiff's] degree of personal 
responsibility . . . ; 2) the amount of prejudice to the 
defendant caused by the delay; 3) the presence or absence of a 
drawn out history of deliberately proceeding in a dilatory 
fashion, and 4) the effectiveness of sanctions less drastic than 
dismissal." Id. at 426-27, 620 P.2d at 749 (formatting altered 
and citation omitted). "[A]bsent deliberate delay, contumacious 
conduct or actual prejudice[,] an order of dismissal cannot be 
affirmed." In re Blaisdell, 125 
Hawai‘i 44, 48, 252 P.3d 63, 67 
(2011) (citations omitted). 
In her August 6, 2020 Motion to Dismiss, Keeley 
alleged "[t]here was a long delay in failing to follow the ICA 
decision since December 2018 to present, a span of two (2) 
years." 
Plaintiff-Appellee Thaddeus Ziemlak on the other hand 
asserted that Keeley delayed the proceedings after the ICA's 
2017 decision by being out of the country and noted that there 
were talks of settlement. 
Following a hearing on the Motion to Dismiss, the 
circuit court denied the Motion because "the ICA did not vacate 
the default against Defendant Keeley, that default still 
6   
 
 
 
   
 
  
 
 
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
stands[.]"4  The circuit court correctly concluded that the 
default entry against Keeley was affirmed and, thus, Keeley's 
liability was not subject to a dismissal. 
As for litigating damages, Keeley argues that she 
suffered "legal prejudice" because witnesses were no longer 
available.
5  "[O]ur precedent establishes that the actual 
prejudice a defendant must suffer is actual damage or detriment 
to the presentation of the defense." Erum v. Llego
, 147 Hawai‘i 
368, 388, 465 P.3d 815, 835 (2020). Because, as discussed 
below, factual bases existed for the court's damages award, we 
cannot say that Keeley suffered actual prejudice in presenting a 
defense to the determination of damages. 
Additionally, Keeley failed to show that any delay 
after this court's decision in 
Ziemlak I was dilatory or that 
less drastic sanctions would be ineffective. See Ellis, 1 Haw. 
App. at 426–27, 620 P.2d at 748-49; In re Blaisdell
, 125 Hawai‘i 
at 49, 252 P.3d at 68 (explaining that "an order of dismissal 
cannot be affirmed absent deliberate delay, contumacious 
conduct, or actual prejudice" and that "the dismissal of a 
complaint with prejudice is such a severe sanction that it 
should seldom be used" (emphasis, citations, and footnote 
4 The Honorable Bert I. Ayabe presided over the hearing. 
5 Keeley also argues that she suffered legal prejudice because a lis 
pendens on her property prevented her from obtaining loans. But the lis 
pendens appears to have been related to Keeley's liability, and was not 
relevant to the determination of damages. 
7   
 
 
 
  
 
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
omitted)). Absent such showings, the circuit court did not 
abuse its discretion when it denied Keeley's motion to dismiss. 
(3)  Finally, Keeley contends the judgment "amount of 
$740,628.76 is erroneously computed and excessive, given the 
debt itself stems from claims of improper withdrawals of 
$165,000 and $100,000 . . . ." Specifically, Keeley challenges 
(a) two amounts - $98,500 and $100,000, and (b) the interest 
applied.  
6 
(a)  Keeley challenges the "$98,500 surplus or profit 
from the sale of the North Carolina house; and the $100,000 
check written to directly [sic] Stanley Ziemlak deposited into 
Stanley Ziemlak's own personal bank account and used by him for 
his living expenses." 
Although Keeley cannot contest the fact of her 
liability, she may contest the amount of her liability. Kam Fui
Tr., 77 
Hawai‘i at 325, 884 P.2d at 388. 
Keeley's record citations for the $98,500 figure do 
not support this amount, and this "court is not required to sift 
through a voluminous record for documentation of a party's 
contentions." Int'l Bhd. of Elec. Workers, Loc. 1357 v.
Hawaiian Tel. Co., 68 Haw. 316, 332, 713 P.2d 943, 956 (1986). 
6 We note that Keeley does not challenge the $152,852.37 award of 
attorneys' fees and costs, and as such, she has waived any argument against
the inclusion of attorneys' fees and costs in the $740,628.76 judgment. HRAP 
Rule 28(b)(4). 
8   
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Instead, the record supports the court's determination that the 
profit from the sale of the North Carolina Property totaled 
$93,805.34.
7  The record also includes an image of a $100,000.00 
check made out to "Stanley F Ziemlak TR UA 07-20-94 Marguerite M 
Ziemlak Rev Living Trust," which includes an endorsement 
signature that Keeley recognized as her own. (Formatting 
altered.) 
Because the record contains factual bases for the 
$93,805.34 and $100,000.00 figures, we cannot say the circuit 
court abused its discretion by including these amounts in the 
damages award. 
(b) Keeley also argues that "interest does not begin 
to run on a debt until it is reduced to [judgment] and not 
before entry of the [judgment]." 
HRS § 636-16 (2016) "applies in all civil cases, vests 
a court with discretion to award prejudgment interest[,]" and 
7 The document Keeley identified as the December 15, 2003 Settlement 
Statement for the purchase of the North Carolina Property indicates she and 
Stanley were the buyers of the Property, and the "gross amount due from 
buyer" for the North Carolina Property was $174,900.00. (Formatting
altered.) A 2007 bank statement Keeley identified as being for the joint 
account she and Stanley shared shows a $268,705.34 deposit. Keeley agreed it
was "fair to say that the deposit made [into the joint account] on April 19,
2007, in the amount of $268,705.34 was from the sale of the North Carolina 
property[.]" The sale price ($268,705.34 ) less the amount paid ($174,900.00)
equals $93,805.34. Thus, the record supports the circuit court's calculation 
of $93,805.34 in net sale proceeds for the North Carolina Property.

authorizes the court "to designate the commencement date."8 
Cnty. of Hawai‘i v. C&J Coupe Fam. Ltd. P'ship, 124 Hawai‘i 281, 
311-12, 242 P.3d 1136, 1166-67 (2010). And HRS § 478-2(3) 
(2008) allows the court to set interest "at the rate of ten per 
cent a year" for "money received to the use of another, from the 
date of a demand made[.]"
9 
Here, the circuit court complied with HRS § 478-2(3) 
when it ordered prejudgment interest at ten percent, and it was 
within the circuit court's discretion under HRS § 636-16 to set 
the commencement date as the date of the entry of default.
10 
8 HRS § 636-16 provides: 
In awarding interest in civil cases, the judge is
authorized to designate the commencement date to conform 
with the circumstances of each case, provided that the 
earliest commencement date in cases arising in tort, may be 
the date when the injury first occurred and in cases
arising by breach of contract, it may be the date when the
breach first occurred. 
(Emphasis added.) 
9 HRS § 478-2 provides in pertinent part: 
When there is no express written contract fixing a 
different rate of interest, interest shall be allowed at 
the rate of ten per cent a year, except that, with respect
to obligations of the State, interest shall be allowed at
the prime rate for each calendar quarter but in no event 
shall exceed ten per cent a year, as follows: 
 . . . . 
(3) For money received to the use of another, from 
the date of a demand made . . . . 
10 The damages award subtotal equaled $326,542.44. Ten percent of 
$326,542.44 is $32,654.24. Nine years and four days elapsed from the clerk's
January 24, 2013 default entry to the circuit court's January 28, 2022 Order, 
but the court mistakenly calculated the time elapsed as eight years. 
(continued . . .)

Thus, we cannot say the court disregarded rules or 
principles of law by including prejudgment interest in the 
damages award. 
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the circuit court's 
January 28, 2022 Judgment.

(. . . continued) 
Thaddeus did not object to the missing ninth year of interest, so his claim
to an additional $32,654.24 is waived. Ten percent interest ($32,654.24) 
each year for eight years totals $261,233.95, the amount of prejudgment
interest the court awarded in its January 28, 2022 Order Granting Renewed 
Motion for Judgment by Default.
