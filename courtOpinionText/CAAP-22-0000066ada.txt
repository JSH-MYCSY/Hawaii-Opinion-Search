MARCH 21, 2025 
HIRAOKA, PRESIDING JUDGE, WADSWORTH AND NAKASONE, JJ. FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY HIRAOKA, J. 
These appeals involve archaeological permits issued by 
the Department of Land and Natural Resources' State Historic 
Preservation Division ( SHPD) to Archaeological Services Hawaii 
LLC (ASH LLC ). Mālama Kakanilua, Clare Apana, and Kaniloa 
Kamaunu (collectively, Mālama) appeal from: (1) the January 31, 
2022 Final Judgment for the Board of Land and Natural Resources (BLNR), the Administrator  of SHPD, and ASH LLC in Judiciary 
Information Management System ( JIMS) case no. 2CCV-21-0000060; 
and (2) the February 17, 2022 Final Judgment for BLNR, the 
Administrator, and ASH LLC in JIMS 2CCV-21-0000131. Both 
judgments were entered by the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit.
1 We hold: (1) in the contested case on ASH LLC's 2020 
permit, BLNR erroneously placed the burden on M ālama to prove 
ASH LLC failed to comply with its permit conditions for calendar years 2015-2017; and (2) Mālama were entitled to a contested case 
on ASH LLC's 2021 permit because of BLNR's procedural error in the contested case for the 2020 permit. We vacate the Final Judgment in JIMS 2CCV-21-0000060 and the Final Judgment in JIMS 2CCV-21-0000131 and remand for entry of a judgment for M ālama and 
against BLNR, the Administrator, and ASH LLC in each case.

review and public interest  exceptions to the mootness doctrine apply. See

I. BACKGROUND 
No archaeological firm may alter a historic property in 
the state of Hawai#i without a permit from the Department of Land 
and Natural Resources ( DLNR). Hawaii Administrative Rules ( HAR) 
§ 13-282-3(a) (eff. 2003). "Historic property" means "any 
building, structure, object, district, area, or site, including heiau and underwater site, which is over fifty years old." HAR § 13-282-2 (eff. 2003). 
ASH LLC applied for an archaeological permit for the 
2020 calendar year. 
Mālama requested a contested case hearing. 
BLNR granted the request and appointed a hearing officer. The hearing officer conducted a seven-day public hearing and submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law and a recommended decision to BLNR on November 30, 2020. On January 16, 2021, M ālama submitted a copy of a March 21, 2018 
letter from SHPD to ASH LLC about the status of 39 archaeological monitoring reports for calendar years 2015, 2016, and 2017. Mālama's submission stated the letter had been requested from SHPD "over four months ago" but was "not provided until now." 
BLNR heard oral argument on January 22, 2021. 
On 
February 4, 2021, BLNR issued an order adopting the hearing officer's findings, conclusions, and recommended decision

(2008). 
3 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(Contested Case Order ).3 BLNR approved ASH LLC's permit 
application. Mālama appealed the Contested Case Order, creating 
JIMS 2CCV-21-0000060. On January 6, 2022, the circuit court 
entered findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a decision and order affirming the Contested Case Order.
4 Mālama filed this 
secondary appeal, creating CAAP-22-0000066. 
Meanwhile, ASH LLC applied for a 2021 permit. Mālama 
requested a contested case hearing. The Administrator recommended that BLNR deny M ālama's request. 
BLNR considered 
ASH LLC's application and M ālama's request during a public 
meeting on April 9, 2021 (two months after the Contested Case Order for the 2020 permit was issued). After hearing testimony, BLNR denied M ālama's request and approved ASH LLC's application 
(2021 Decision ). Mālama appealed, creating JIMS 2CCV-21-0000131. 
On February 8, 2022, the circuit court entered findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a decision and order affirming the 2021 Decision. Mālama filed this secondary appeal, creating CAAP-22-
0000067. 
We consolidated the appeals. 
3 BLNR made only typographical and other non-substantive changes to
the hearing officer's findings of fact and conclusions of law. 
4 A circuit court reviewing an agency decision acts as an appellate
court. It shouldn't make its own findings of fact; it decides whether the
agency's findings of fact were clearly erroneous based on the evidence beforethe agency. Sierra Club v. Bd. of Land & Nat. Res.
, 154 Hawai#i 264, 284, 550
P.3d 230, 250 (App. 2024), 
cert. granted , No. SCWC-22-0000516, 2024 WL 3378462
(Haw. July 11, 2024). 
4 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
II. POINTS OF ERROR 
Mālama state four points of error, which we reorder and 
paraphrase: (1)
 SHPD, not BLNR, should have conducted the 
contested case hearing on ASH LLC's application for the 2020 
permit and decided M ālama's contested case hearing request for 
the 2021 permit; (2) BLNR exceeded its statutory authority and 
acted on unlawful procedure when it approved the 2020 permit; (3) Mālama were entitled to a contested case hearing on the 2021 
permit application; and (4) BLNR erred by concluding ASH LLC had 
a principal investigator "on staff," by not requiring ASH LLC's 
principal investigator to answer questions about his employment, and by not allowing M ālama to conduct discovery of ASH LLC's 
principal investigator's work records. 
III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
Our review of the circuit court's decisions are 
secondary appeals; we must determine whether the circuit court's decisions were right or wrong by applying the standards in Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS
) § 91–14(g) to BLNR's decisions based on 
the record before BLNR. Flores v. Bd. of Land & Nat. Res. , 143 
Hawai#i 114, 120, 424 P.3d 469, 475 (2018). 
HRS § 91–14(g) (2012 & Supp. 2021), titled "Judicial 
review of contested cases[,]" provides in relevant part: 
Upon review of the record, the court may affirm the
decision of the agency or remand the case withinstructions for further proceedings; or it mayreverse or modify the decision and order if thesubstantial rights of the petitioners may have beenprejudiced because the administrative findings,conclusions, decisions, or orders are: 
5 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(1) In violation of constitutional or statutory
provisions; 
(2) In excess of the statutory authority orjurisdiction of the agency; 
(3) Made upon unlawful procedure; 
(4) Affected by other error of law; 
(5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,probative, and substantial evidence on the wholerecord; or 
(6) Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized byabuse of discretion or clearly unwarrantedexercise of discretion. 
"Under HRS § 91-14(g), conclusions of law are 
reviewable under subsections (1), (2), and (4); questions 
regarding procedural defects under subsection (3); findings of fact under subsection (5); and an agency's exercise of discretion under subsection (6)." Flores, 143 Hawai #i at 121, 424 P.3d at 
476 (cleaned up). 
Whether an agency followed proper procedures in its 
decision-making is a question of law, which we review de novo. Sierra Club v. Dep't of Transp. , 115 Hawai #i 299, 315, 167 P.3d 
292, 308 (2007). 
IV. DISCUSSION 
A. BLNR was authorized to conduct the contested 
case hearing and to decide M ā
lama's request
for a contested case. 
Mālama
 contend that SHPD, not BLNR, was authorized to 
conduct the contested case hearing on the 2020 permit and decide 
Mālama's request for a contested case hearing on the 2021 permit application. Mālama's contention is not correct. SHPD is a 
division of DLNR. HRS § 6E-3 (2009 & Supp. 2021). HAR § 13-1-28 
6 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(eff. 2009) applies to all DLNR contested cases. It provides: 
"When required by law, the board shall hold a contested case 
hearing[.]" HAR § 13-1-28(a) (emphasis added). "Board" means BLNR. HAR § 13-1-2(a) (eff. 2009). 
Mālama argue that a circuit court order in another case 
(the 2019 Order ) is the law of this case, and therefore SHPD must 
conduct a contested case hearing. The 2019 Order required a contested case hearing on ASH LLC's permit application for calendar year 2019. It is not the law of the case in this appeal involving permits for 2020 and 2021. See Ditto v. McCurdy , 98 
Hawai#i 123, 128, 44 P.3d 274, 279 (2002) (stating that "the law 
of the case concept applies to single proceedings, and operates to foreclose re-examination of decided issues either on remand or on a subsequent appeal"). 
Mālama also argue we should give preclusive effect to 
the 2019 Order. Res judicata, or claim preclusion, "prohibits a party from relitigating a previously adjudicated cause of action." Pendleton v. Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Kahala 
Towers, 153 Hawai #i 126, 135, 527 P.3d 462, 471 (App. 2023). The 
party asserting claim preclusion must show that the claim decided in the previous suit is identical to the one presented in the action in question. Id. The 2019 Order did not decide that 
SHPD, rather than BLNR, must conduct the proceeding; that issue was not before the circuit court. 
Collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, "applies to a 
subsequent suit between the parties or their privies on a 
7 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
different  cause of action and prevents the parties or their 
privies from relitigating any issue  that was actually litigated 
and finally decided in the earlier action." Pendleton, 153 
Hawai#i at 135, 527 P.3d at 471. Whether BLNR or SHPD was to 
conduct the contested case hearing was neither litigated nor decided by the 2019 Order. Mālama's preclusion argument is not 
persuasive. 
We hold that BLNR, not SHPD, was authorized by statute 
and administrative rule to decide the contested case on ASH LLC's application for its 2020 permit, and to decide M ālama's request 
for a contested case hearing on ASH LLC's application for its 2021 permit. 
B. BLNR's decision on the 2020 permit was made
upon unlawful procedure inconsistent withBLNR's constitutional duty. 
M
ālama contend BLNR exceeded its statutory authority 
and acted on unlawful procedure when it approved the 2020 permit. 
We held above that BLNR was authorized by statute and administrative rule to decide the contested case on ASH LLC's 2020 permit application. We review de novo whether BLNR followed 
the appropriate procedure in so doing. Sierra Club , 115 
Hawai#i 
at 315, 167 P.3d at 308. 
Mālama argue — and BLNR, the Administrator, and ASH LLC 
don't contest — that M ālama have a property interest in 
protecting iwi kupuna (native Hawaiian burials) under 
8 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
article XII, section 7 of the Hawai #i Constitution.5 ASH LLC's 
activities under an archaeological permit could impact M ālama's 
constitutionally protected interest. See Kaleikini v. Thielen , 
124 Hawai# i 1, 26, 237 P.3d 1067, 1092 (2010) (recognizing that 
article XII, section 7 of the Hawai#i
 Constitution protects 
cultural and religious beliefs about protecting iwi kupuna); cf. 
Kaleikini v. Yoshioka , 128 Hawai #i 53, 59-60, 283 P.3d 60, 66-67 
(2012) (discussing Honolulu rail project draft programmatic agreement for handling iwi kupuna). Article XII, section 7 "places an affirmative duty  on the State and its agencies to 
preserve and protect traditional and customary native Hawaiian rights, and confers upon the State and its agencies 'the power to protect these rights and to prevent any interference with the exercise of these rights.'" Ka Pa#akai O Ka #Aina v. Land Use 
Comm'n, 94 Hawai #i 31, 45, 7 P.3d 1068, 1082 (2000) (emphasis 
added) (quoting Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 57, in 1 Proceedings of the Constitutional Convention of 1978, at 639 (1980)). 
Mā
lama's opposition to ASH LLC's permit application 
alleged that "ASH fails to perform its archaeological services

work in compliance with the conditions set forth in HAR [§] 13-
282-3." HAR § 13-282-3 provides, in relevant part: 
(f) Each permit shall contain the following conditions: 
(1) The permittee shall submit, within one month of the
conclusion of any field work, a brief report onfindings to consist of: 
(A) A map locating all sites studied, to be on a
portion of the relevant United States GeologicalSurvey standard 1:24,000 topographic map; and 
(B) A table listing each site, its majorarchitectural features, its probable function,and the nature of work at each site (mapping,description, surface collection, testexcavation). 
(2) The permittee shall submit a minimum of two copies ofa report or paper on any archaeological work to theSHPD. 
(3) The permittee shall ensure all personnel are capableof adequately conducting the necessary work toaccomplish any scopes of work. 
(4) The permittee shall comply with all applicablestatutes, ordinances, rules and regulations of thefederal, state and county governments[.] 
BLNR found: 
64. [Mālama] also contend that ASH did not properly
perform other types or scopes of archaeological worksuch as monitoring[] grubbing and grading work[,] andfailed to properly manage and care for iwi kupuna thatwas discovered in the course of its work. [M ālama]
reported incidents at projects where ASH was involvedat which alleged improper monitoring, insufficientmonitors or absence of monitors at sites where grading, excavation or other earthwork was beingperformed. [M ālama] also reported incidents relating
to the care and handling of iwi kupuna where theyassert that ASH personnel were improperly handling iwikupuna. The Hearing Officer finds from the record and
evidence presented in this matter insufficientevidence to support or prove such claims and
assertions by a preponderance of the evidence . 
65. HAR [§ 13-282-3(f)] sets forth certain conditions
attached to the issuance of archaeological permits.[Mālama] contend that ASH has failed to perform its
archaeological services work in compliance withcertain of those conditions set forth in HAR §[ ]13-282-3(f) such as the following: 
10 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(1) The permittee shall submit, within one month
of the conclusion of any field work, a briefreport on findings to consist of: 
(A) A map locating all sites studied, to
be on a portion of the relevant United StatesGeological Survey standard 1:24,000 topographicmap; and 
(B) A table listing each site, . . . its
probable function, and the nature of work ateach site (mapping, description, surfacecollection, test excavation). 
(2) The permittee shall submit a minimum of two
copies of a report or paper on any archeologicalwork to SHPD. 
. . . . 
66. [M
ālama] assert that ASH has not been timely in its
submissions of reports to SHPD and that ASH has notfiled reports as required by HAR [§ 13-282-3(f)]. . . . 
67. The record presented in this case reflects thatreports have been submitted to SHPD by ASH and ASHacknowledges that some reports have not been submittedor were submitted late. The record in this case does 
not present information sufficient to identify,distinguish or establish which kind of report(s) weresubmitted or which kind of report(s) have not been
submitted . Reports required by HAR [§ 13-282-3(f)(1)]
are required to be submitted "within one month of the
conclusion of any field work" however, the recordpresented does not reflect whether field work has beenconcluded so that it can be determined whether and how many reports are due or overdue. The reportsreferenced in HAR [§ 13-282-3(f)(2)] do not have aspecified timeframe for when reports pertaining to"any archeological work" is to be submitted. The 
record in this case does not present informationsufficient to assess the materiality and significanceof an asserted "late" report or the absence of a
report.  From the limited information presented on the
status of submission or non-submission of reports, the 
Hearing Officer finds insufficient information to
support a conclusion that there has been a materialfailure on the part of ASH to file reports inaccordance with the requirements of HAR [§ 13-282-
3(f)(1)] or HAR [§ 13-282-3(f)(2)] . 
68. . . . The Hearing Officer finds from the record and
evidence presented in this matter insufficientevidence to establish or prove [M ālama]'s claims  and 
assertions that ASH failed to perform itsarchaeological services work in compliance with theconditions set forth in HAR §[ ]13-282-3(f). 
(Emphasis added) (underscoring omitted). 
11 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
After the hearing officer submitted his recommended 
decision but before BLNR heard oral argument, Mālama submitted a 
copy of SHPD's March 21, 2018 letter to Jeff Pantaleo, ASH LLC's 
then-principal investigator. SHPD's letter referred to ASH LLC's overdue response to SHPD's February 2, 2018 "request for information regarding the status of each SHPD-approved archaeological monitoring plan (AMP) prepared under your SHPD-issued archaeological permit for the period 2015-2017." Two spreadsheets were enclosed. One listed 37 "AMPs submitted under your permit during this period, for which SHPD has no record of receiving an archaeological monitoring report (AMR) for SHPD for review and acceptance." SHPD requested, for each of the 37 monitoring plans: 
(1) The status of the archaeological fieldwork, i.e.
whether the project has not occurred, is currentlyongoing, or monitoring has been completed w/date ofcompletion; or 
(2) Whether the project moved forward without ASHconducting archaeological monitoring; and 
(3) If the project is finished, provide a submittal feesheet documenting when the archaeological monitoringreport was submitted to SHPD for review. 
The other spreadsheet listed two of ASH LLC's draft 
monitoring reports for which SHPD had requested, but not 
received, revised drafts for review. 
SHPD requested ASH LLC's response in 30 days. The 
record contains no response from ASH LLC. During the contested case hearing ASH LLC's owner Lisa Rotunno-Hazuka admitted that ASH LLC submitted four or five monitoring plans for projects in the Mauna Lani district but only one monitoring report in 2018, 
12 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and that in some projects, years have gone by without ASH LLC 
submitting required monitoring reports. She admitted "it is our error in being behind." But, she added, "we are not the only firm that has not turned in all monitoring reports." 
The SHPD Administrator testified that "review of 
reports" is "the principal means" SHPD uses to check whether archaeologists are following the law. He then said, 
the problem we have is that for the most part we are never
-- we don't know when the work is completed. So we know every year a number of projects which we never get reportson, we don't know whether that's because the report wasnever prepared or the project never moved forward, and wejust -- we simply don't have the resources to follow up tomake determinations on why we haven't received a monitoringreport after we approved the monitoring plan. 
When asked about consequences of not receiving reports, 
he replied: 
At the moment there's very little consequence. As I 
said, we have very little capacity to tell whether a reportis simply overdue or whether the underlying project thatwould have lead to the monitoring never occurred. 
On this record we conclude the hearing officer — and 
thereby, BLNR — erred by placing the burden on M ālama to prove 
that ASH LLC did not comply with its HAR § 13-282-3(f) permit 
conditions. See In re Kukui (Molokai), Inc. , 116 Hawai #i 481, 
509, 174 P.3d 320, 348 (2007) (holding that Commission on Water Resource Management's conclusion that "no evidence was presented" to show that rights of native Hawaiians would be adversely affected erroneously shifted the burden of proof to parties opposing permit). 
13 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
BLNR has an affirmative duty to preserve and protect 
traditional and customary native Hawaiian rights, Ka Paakai O #
Ka
#Aina, 94 Hawai #i at 45, 7 P.3d at 1082, such as protecting iwi 
kupuna. 
BLNR acknowledges that "if ASH violated the terms of its 
permit, the Board still retains the discretion to revoke it or 
not issue a new permit." A permittee's failure to comply with the HAR § 13-282-3(f) conditions for previous permits may be good cause to deny another permit, depending on the circumstances. The Administrator testified that "review of reports" is "the principal means" SHPD uses to see if archaeologists are following the law, but SHPD doesn't "have the resources" or has "very little capacity" to do its job. After being made aware of SHPD's March 21, 2018 letter to ASH LLC questioning the status of 39 archaeological monitoring reports for 2015-2017, BLNR should have required ASH LLC to prove its compliance with HAR § 13-282-3(f) for at least  those three permit years, or to show good cause for 
noncompliance. Having not made that inquiry, BLNR breached its affirmative duty to preserve and protect traditional and customary native Hawaiian rights to protect iwi kupuna. 
Cf. 
Kauai Springs, Inc. v. Plan. Comm'n of Cnty. of Kaua#i, 133 
Hawai#i 141, 173, 324 P.3d 951, 983 (2014) (holding that county 
planning commission "is duty-bound to place the burden on the applicant to justify the proposed water use in light of the [public] trust purposes"). 
ASH LLC argues that "[w]ithout evidence of which 
reports were overdue, or the effect of the overdue reports, 
14 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
[BLNR] did not abuse its discretion by holding that there 
was insufficient evidence that ASH materially or significantly breached any permit conditions in a way which would justify denying them a permit." ASH LLC should have the evidence needed to prove it complied with permit conditions, or had good reasons for not complying. BLNR erroneously placed the burden on M ālama 
to show that ASH LLC's purported failures to comply "abridge or deny their traditional and customary . . . rights." In re 
Wai#ola O Moloka #i, Inc., 103 Hawai #i 401, 442, 83 P.3d 664, 705 
(2004). BLNR should have required that ASH LLC show good cause for its failures to comply with its permit conditions, and provide information sufficient for BLNR to make the minimum findings to ensure that Mā
lama's customary and traditional 
practices were protected to the extent feasible, before approving the application for another permit. The Contested Case Order was thus made upon unlawful procedure inconsistent with BLNR's duty under Haw. Const. art. XII, § 7. HRS § 91–14(g)(1), (3). The circuit court was wrong to affirm it. 
C. Mālama were entitled to a contested case 
hearing on the calendar year 2021 permitapplication. 
Mālama contend they were entitled to a contested case 
hearing on ASH LLC's application for its 2021 permit. 
SHPD's 
submittal to BLNR on ASH LLC's permit application stated: 
We expect that [M ālama] will ask for a contested case as to
the permit. 
Assuming (without agreeing) that [M ālama] have
an interest entitled to due process protection, [they] arenevertheless not entitled to another contested case. Determination of what process is due requires examination 
15 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and balancing of three factors: "(1) the private interest
which will be affected; (2) the risk of an erroneousdeprivation of such interest through the procedures actuallyused, and the probable value, if any, of additional oralternative procedural safeguards; and (3) the governmentalinterest, including the burden that additional proceduralsafeguards would entail." [Flores v. Bd. of Land & Nat. Res.], 143 Hawai #i 114, 126–27, 424 P.3d 469, 481–82 (2018).
Under the circumstances presented here, due process does notrequire any additional procedures to safeguard [ Mālama
]'s
interests. Most especially, petitioners have already
received a complete contested case hearing as to ASH's 2020
request. 
(Emphasis added.) 
Apana submitted written testimony supporting Mālama's 
request. Apana, Kamaunu, Noelani Ahia (a member of M ālama 
Kakanilua's board), and Cecily Riley spoke at BLNR's public 
meeting in support of the request. A BLNR member moved to accept 
the staff recommendation to deny the contested case hearing request. The member stated: 
Just briefly, the -- what we've heard mostly on this
contested case request is that folks are dissatisfied with 
the result of the first contested case hearing . They have a
judicial appeal on that. So that gives them due processwith respect to how the first contested case hearing wasconducted. And I just -- it seems to me that the -- thatthe interests of people who are concerned about iwi which Igreatly respect and are very important, are protected by theSHPD, the burial councils and all those legal means thatexist to protect iwi that are not being -- are not dealtwith by the question of having contested case hearings overthe licensing of architectural -- archaeological firms. 
BLNR members voted unanimously to deny Mālama's request 
for a contested case. 
BLNR must hold a contested case hearing when required 
by law. HRS § 91-1 (Supp. 2021). A contested case is "required 
by law" when one is required by constitutional due process. Flores, 143 
Hawai#i at 124, 424 P.3d at 479. Mālama argue they 
had a constitutional due process right to a contested case 
16 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
hearing. The supreme court has articulated a two-step analysis 
for determining whether a party has a constitutional due process right to a contested case: 
First, this court considers whether the particular interest
which claimant seeks to protect by a hearing is "property"within the meaning of the due process clauses of the federaland state constitutions. Second, if this court concludesthat the interest is "property," this court analyzes whatspecific procedures are required to protect it. 
Id. at 125, 424 P.3d at 480 (cleaned up). 
As discussed above, M ālama have a constitutionally 
protected property interest in protecting iwi kupuna. Once a 
party shows it has a constitutionally protected property 
interest, the second step involves a balancing test to determine whether a contested case is required to protect it. 
The factors 
to be balanced are: 
(1) the private interest which will be affected; [and] 
(2) the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest
through the procedures actually used, and the probablevalue, if any, of additional or alternative proceduralsafeguards; [against] 
(3) the governmental interest, including the burden thatadditional procedural safeguards would entail.

Here, BLNR's Contested Case Order (on ASH LLC's 
application for its 2020 permit) was issued on February 4, 2021, 
just two months before BLNR's April 9, 2021 public meeting where Mālama's request for a contested case on ASH LLC's application 
for its 2021 permit was considered. 
But these cases aren't like 
Flores, where the supreme court believed 
17 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
there is no risk of erroneous deprivation, because Flores
has already been afforded a full opportunity to participatein a contested case hearing and express his views andconcerns on the matter, and he has not persuaded us that theprovision of an additional contested case hearing isnecessary to adequately safeguard against erroneousdeprivation in this case. 
143 Hawai# i at 127, 424 P.3d at 482. 
Here, the Contested Case Order was made upon unlawful 
procedure inconsistent with BLNR's affirmative duty under Haw. 
Const. art. XII, § 7. Preventing another erroneous deprivation of Mā
lama's constitutionally protected property interest 
outweighs the burden another contested case may place on BLNR. Mālama were entitled to a contested case hearing on the calendar year 2021 permit application under the circumstances presented here. The circuit court was wrong to affirm BLNR's denial of 
M
ālama's request for a contested case hearing. 
We need not decide M ālama's fourth point of error. 
V.
 CONCLUSION 
In the contested case over ASH LLC's calendar year 2020 
permit, BLNR erroneously shifted the burden to M ālama to prove 
that ASH LLC didn't comply with its HAR § 13-282-3(f) permit conditions for calendar years 2015-2017. That was not consistent 
with BLNR's affirmative duty to preserve and protect traditional and customary native Hawaiian rights to protect iwi kupuna under article XII, section 7 of the 
Hawai#i Constitution. Because of 
this, M ālama were entitled to a contested case on ASH LLC's 
calendar year 2021 permit application. We vacate the Final Judgment in JIMS 2CCV-21-0000060 and the Final Judgment in JIMS 
18 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2CCV-21-0000131. We remand for entry of judgments for M ālama and 
against BLNR, the Administrator, and ASH LLC in both cases. Both 
permits having expired, no remand to BLNR is necessary.
