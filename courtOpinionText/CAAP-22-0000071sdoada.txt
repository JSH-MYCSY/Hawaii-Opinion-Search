KAUAI ISLAND UTILITY COOPERATIVE, Respondent-Appellant  
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT  
(CASE NO. 1CSP-21-0000261)  
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION  ORDER  
(By:   Leonard, Acting Chief  Judge, Wadsworth  and Guidry, JJ.)  
 
Respondent -Appellant Kauai Island Utility Cooperative 
(KIUC) appeals from the Circuit Court of the First Circuit's 
(circuit court )1 (1) Order Denying KIUC's Motion to Dismiss Green 
Energy Team LLC's ( GET) Motion to Confirm Arbitration Award 
(Order Denying KIUC's Motion to Dismiss ), filed on December 3, 
2021; (2) Order Denying KIUC's Motion to Vacate Arbitration

Award or, in the Alternative to Clarify ( Order Denying KIUC's 
Motion to Vacate ), filed on January 26, 2022; (3) Order Granting 
GET's Motion to Confirm Arbitration Award ( Order Granting GET's 
Motion to Confirm ), filed on January 26, 2022; and (4) Amended 
Final Judgment, filed on March 31, 2022. 
This matter arises out of an arbitration between KIUC 
and GET. In January 2011, KIUC and GET entered into a Power 
Purchase Agreement ( PPA), pursuant to which , inter alia, GET 
would sell energy to KIUC , and KIUC would pay a monthly Capacity 
Charge that was set by the PPA . In September 2018, GET sought 
an increase in the Capacity Charge ; KIUC denied this request . 2 
In August 2020, KIUC and GET entered into an Agreement to 
Participate in Binding Arbitration ( Arbitration Agreement ). The 
arbitration was conducted "remotely through [Z]oom" in April 
2021, with the arbitrators located in the First Circuit . The 
parties presented a single issue for arbitration : "Whether KIUC 
unreasonably withheld approval of GET's request for a [C]apacity 
[C]harge increase." In August 2021, t he arbitrators issued the 
Final Arbitration Award, in which they found that KIUC 
unreasonably withh eld approval , and awarded GET a specific 
Capacity Charge increase , and attorneys ' fees and costs. 
Pursuant to the PPA, the Management Committee, comprised of three 
KIUC representatives and two GET representatives, reviews requests for 
capital additions and modifications that would increase the Capacity Charge. 
The record reflects that all three KIUC representatives opposed GET's 
request.

In September 2021, GET initiated a special proceeding 
in circuit court to confirm the Final Arbitration Award. In 
October 2021, KIUC filed its Motion to Dismiss GET's Motion to 
Confirm Arbitration Award or, in the Alternative, to Transfer 
Venue, which the circuit court denied. In November 2021, KIUC 
filed its Motion to Vacate Arbitration Award or, in the 
Alternative, to Clarify. In January 2022, the circuit court 
denied KIUC's motion to vacate and granted GET's motion to 
confirm. In March 2022, the circuit court entered an Amended 
Final Judgment. This appeal followed. 
On appeal, KIUC raises three points of error: (1) "The 
[c]ircuit [c]ourt erred when it denied KIUC's Motion To Dismiss 
and denied KIUC's request to change venue"; (2) "The [c]ircuit 
[c]ourt erred when it denied KIUC's Motion To Vacate and granted 
GET's Mot ion To Confirm when it concluded that the arbitrators 
were within their authority to increase the Capacity Charge 
without approval from the [Public Utilities Commission ( PUC)]"; 
and (3) "The [c]ircuit [c]ourt erred when it denied KIUC's 
Motion To Vacate in part" when it found that one of the 
arbitrators "properly and fully disclose d her prior involvement 
in another arbitration [.]" 
Upon careful review of the record , briefs, and 
relevant legal authorities , and having given due consideration 
3   
 
 
  
   
 
     
   
 
 
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties , 
we resolve KIUC's points of error as follows : 
(1) KIUC contends that, pursuant  to the PPA, the 
proper venue for GET's motion to confirm  was  the Fifth Circuit, 
and not the First Circuit. We review the circuit court's ruling 
on a motion to dismiss de novo under the right/wrong standard. 
Kamaka v. Goodsill Anderson Quinn & Stifel, 117 Hawaiʻi 92, 104, 
176 P.3d 91, 103 (2008).  
Here, the express terms of the PPA conflict with the 
relevant legal authority. The plain language of the PPA states 
that "[s]ubject to Article 14, the venue for any civil action 
related to this [PPA] shall be the judicial circuit in which 
[GET's] facility is located ," which, here, would be the Fifth 
Circuit. Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 658A-27 (2016) states 
that motions to confirm an arbitration award "shall be made in 
the court of the circuit in which the agreement to arbitrate 
specifies the arbitrat ion hearing is to be held or, if the 
hearing has been held, in the court of the circuit in which it 
was held."3 
"[T]he statute must take precedence over the terms of 
the contract" where the contract's terms appear to be in direct 
3  The Arbitration Agreement does not specify a venue. However, by 
entering into the Arbitration Agreement, the parties agreed to abide by the 
Dispute Prevention & Resolution , Inc. Rules which set Honolulu as the 
arbitration venue. The parties also stipulated to designate Honolulu as the 
arbitration venue, and all of the arbitrators were located in Honolulu.

conflict with the statute. Sol v. AIG Haw. Ins. Co., 76 Hawai ʻi 
304, 307, 875 P.2d 921, 924 (1994) (citation omitted). The  
First Circuit was therefore, pursuant to the statute, the  proper 
venue for the motion to confirm.  We therefore conclude  that the 
circuit court did not err in denying KIUC's motion to dismiss 
and request to change venue.  
(2) KIUC contends that the circuit court erred in 
denying KIUC's motion to vacate and granting GET's motion to 
confirm, and,  in so doing, concluding that the arbitrators were 
authorized to change the Capacity Charge set in the PPA without PUC approval. "We review [a] [circuit] court's ruling on an 
arbitration award de novo," but are cognizant that a circuit 
court's "review of an arbitration award [must be] confined to 
the strictest possible limits,  and a court may only vacate an 
award on the grounds specified in HRS § 658A-23  [(2016).]" 
Tatibouet  v. Ellsworth, 99 
Hawaiʻi 226,  233, 54 P.3d 397,  404 
(2002) (citation omitted); Haw. State Tchrs. Ass'n  v. State 
Dep't of Educ., 140  Hawaiʻi 381,  391, 400 P.3d 582,  592 (2017) 
(cleaned up).  
HRS § 658A-23 states that "[u] pon motion to the court 
by a party to an arbitration proceeding , the court shall vacate 
an award made in the arbitration proceeding if . . . [ the] 
arbitrator exceeded the arbitrator's powers[.]" "The scope of 
an arbitrator's authority is determined by [the] agreement of 
5

the parties. [Arbitrators] must act within the scope of the 
authority conferred upon [them] by the parties and cannot exceed 
[their] power by deciding matters not submitted." State Org. of 
Police Officers (SHOPO) v. Cnty. of Kauaʻi, 134 Hawaiʻi 155, 159, 
338 P.3d 1170, 1174 (App. 2014) (citation omitted). 
Pursuant to the PPA, arbitrators may "interpret and 
apply [the PPA's] terms and conditions . . . and . . . order any 
remedy allowed." They are prohibited , however, from changing 
any term or condition of the PPA. 
Here, we conclude that the arbitrators did not exceed 
the scope of their authority by finding, based upon the totality 
of the evidence and arguments presented, "that KIUC unreasonably 
withheld approval of GET's request for a [C]apacity [C]harge 
increase." The PPA authorizes KIUC's Management Committee to 
approve requests for "capital additions and modifications ," and 
instructs that the Management Committee cannot unreasonably 
withhold such approval.4 
4 Section 5.1C(2) of the PPA states that "[c]apital additions or 
modifications that require any change to the Capacity Charge are subject to 
approval by the Management Committee," and such approval cannot be 
"unreasonably with[held]." Section 3.2J of the PPA provides that "requests 
for amendment to [the PPA] . . . are subject to the approval of KIUC and 
[GET], and the PUC if applicable." Section 24.14 of the PPA states that "any 
amendments . . . [are] subject to approval by the PUC an d the Parties' 
respective obligations hereunder are conditioned upon receipt of such 
approval[.]" 
The term "capital addition" is not defined in the PPA. 
Therefore, approving capital additions would not change a term in or amend 
the PPA.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
We further conclude, however, that the arbitrators 
exceeded their authority by also awarding GET "a [C]apacity 
[C]harge increase of $8.03/kW." Section 24.14 of the PPA states 
that "any amendments . . . [are] subject to approval by the 
PUC[.]" "Capacity Charge" is a defined and fixed term . 5 A 
change to the Capacity Charge set by the PPA – i.e., the 
amendment of a defined and fixed term within the PPA – requires 
PUC approval . We therefore conclude that the circuit court 
erred in denying KIUC's motion to vacate , and granting GET's 
motion to confirm. 
(3) KIUC contends that one of the arbitrators failed 
to adequately disclose her involvement in a prior arbitration 
between GET and another entity. In light of our decision to

Capacity Charge -The amount to be paid by KIUC to 
[GET] pursuant to Section 5.1[C] (Capacity Charge). 
[5.1]C. Capacity Charge

and Forty -Five/100 Dollars per kW ($71.45 /kW) per Month. The 
Capacity Charge shall be paid monthly, and is net, including 
all taxes. . . .

vacate the Order Denying KIUC's Motion to Vacate and the Order 
Granting GET's Motion to Confirm , we need not determine whether 
the arbitrator made sufficient disclosures, and whether KIUC 
waived its ability to challenge the Final Arbitration Award on 
this ground. 
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Order Denying 
KIUC's Motion to Dismiss, but we vacate the Order Denying KIUC's 
Motion to Vacate , the Order Granting GET's Motion to Confirm , 
and the Amended Final Judgment , and remand for further 
proceedings consistent with this summary disposition order.
