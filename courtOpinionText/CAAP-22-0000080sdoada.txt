SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Wadsworth, Presiding Judge, and McCullen and Guidry, JJ.) 
In these consolidated appeals, Defendants-Appellants 
Randall Spear (Spear
) and Dan Jeffers (Jeffers) (together,
Defendants) appeal from the January 24, 2022 "Order Granting in 
Part and Denying in Part 'Defendants['] . . . Motion to Confirm 
in Part and Vacate in Part the Final Award of Arbitrator' Filed 
on December 27, 2017" (Confirmation Order), and the April 5, 2022 
"Judgment on [Confirmation Order]," both entered by the Circuit 
Court of the First Circuit.
1/ 
I. Background 
On February 21, 2014, Plaintiff-Appellee Debbie 
Eichelberger (Eichelberger) filed a complaint against Defendants, 
asserting twelve claims related to the ownership and management 
of two bars operating as Arnold's Beach Bar and Grill (Arnold's) 
1/ The Honorable Gary W.B. Chang presided.   
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
and King's Pub (King's).2/  On April 1, 2014, Defendants answered 
the complaint, and Spear filed a counterclaim asserting ownership 
of Arnold's and King's. Eichelberger and Defendants agreed to 
have their claims resolved through arbitration with the Honorable 
Patrick K.S.L. Yim (Ret.) serving as the arbitrator (Arbitrator). 
The Arbitrator bifurcated the case into two segments. 
The first segment comprised arbitration hearings that were held 
on January 8, 9, and 23, February 6 and 12, March 5, 6, and 8, 
and April 9 and 10, 2015. 
On August 21, 2015, the Arbitrator issued a Partial 
Final Award of Arbitrator (Partial Final Award), which, among 
other things, awarded joint ownership of Ruma, Arnold's and 
King's (the Businesses) as follows: 75% to Eichelberger, 25% to 
Spears, and 0% to Jeffers. The Arbitrator ordered Defendants to 
perform all acts necessary to restore Eichelberger as sole and 
controlling manager of the Businesses, and reserved jurisdiction 
to determine certain monetary claims and any other remedies 
deemed by the Arbitrator to be fair and reasonable in furtherance 
of the Partial Final Award. 
On August 28, 2015, Eichelberger filed a motion for an 
order confirming the Partial Final Award, which Defendants 
opposed. On September 2, 2015, Defendants filed a motion to 
vacate the Partial Final Award, which Eichelberger opposed. On 
October 7, 2015, the Circuit Court entered: (1) an order denying 
Defendants' motion to vacate the Partial Final Award; (2) an 
order granting Eichelberger's motion for an order confirming the 
Partial Final Award; and (3) a related judgment. 
Meanwhile, the Arbitrator held a further hearing on 
June 13, 2017, and issued his Final Award of Arbitrator (Final 
Award) on September 28, 2017. The Arbitrator denied the parties' 
claims for monetary damages and fees and costs, and relinquished 
jurisdiction. 
On December 27, 2017, Defendants filed a motion to 
confirm in part and vacate in part the Final Award (Motion to
Confirm/Vacate), which Eichelberger opposed.  Defendants 
2/ Eichelberger alleged that Ruma Spear, LLC (Ruma) owns and operates
Arnold's and that Blu Boy, Inc. operates, i.e., does business as, King's. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
requested that the Circuit Court: (1) confirm the Final Award as 
to the parties' monetary claims for the period from September 1, 
2013 through September 15, 2015; (2) vacate the Final Award as to 
the Arbitrator's determination that Eichelberger owned 75% and 
Spear owned 25% of Arnold's and King's, and any finding on the 
parties' monetary claims for the period prior to September 1, 
2013; and (3) find that the Arbitrator made no determination as 
to the parties' monetary claims from September 16, 2015, going 
forward. 
On January 24, 2022, the Circuit Court entered the 
Confirmation Order. The court granted Defendants' request to 
confirm the Final Award to the extent the Arbitrator denied all 
claims by the parties for monetary relief. The court denied 
Defendants' request (a) to vacate the Arbitrator's determination 
regarding ownership of Arnold's and King's, and (b) to find that 
the Arbitrator made no determination as to the parties' monetary 
claims from September 16, 2015, going forward. 
On appeal, Defendants contend that the Circuit Court 
erred in denying their request to vacate the Final Award, where 
the Arbitrator: (1) exceeded his powers under Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS) § 658A-23(a)(4) and violated public policy in 
determining the parties' ownership percentages of the Businesses; 
(2) conducted the arbitration hearing contrary to the provisions 
of HRS § 658A-15; and (3) violated HRS § 658A-23(a)(3) by failing 
to postpone the second arbitration hearing. Eichelberger 
contends as a threshold matter that this court lacks jurisdiction 
over Defendants' appeal, because Defendants' points of error all 
involve the denial of their request to vacate portions of the 
Final Award. 
After reviewing the record on appeal and the relevant 
legal authorities, and giving due consideration to the issues 
raised and the arguments advanced by the parties, we resolve the 
parties' contentions as follows. 
II. Discussion 
Initially, we conclude that we have jurisdiction over 
Defendants' appeal from the judgment on the Confirmation Order. 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
See HRS § 658A-28(a)(6) ("An appeal may be taken from . . . (6) 
[a] final judgment entered pursuant to this chapter." (formatting 
altered)). 
We resolve Defendants' points of error as follows, and 
affirm: 
(1) Defendants contend that the Arbitrator exceeded his 
powers under HRS § 658A-23(a)(4)
3/  and violated public policy in 
determining the parties' ownership percentages of the Businesses, 
where the parties submitted for arbitration the issue of which of 
two parties, Eichelberger or Spear, owned the Businesses, and "it 
was clear the two parties could not co-exist." 
The Hawai#i Supreme Court has stated: 
In determining whether an arbitrator has exceeded his
or her authority under the agreement, "there should be no
'second guessing' by the court" of the arbitrator's
interpretation of his or her authority so long as the
arbitrator's interpretation "could have rested on an
interpretation and application of the agreement." Local 
Union 1260 Int'l Bhd. of Elec. Workers v. Hawaiian Tel. Co.,

Prof'l Assembly v. Univ. of Haw.], 66 Haw. [207,] 210, 659
P.2d [717,] 719 [(1983) (per curiam)] (explaining that the
issue of arbitrability should be decided by the arbitrator,
rather than the court, because "the parties agreed to submit

In re Grievance Arbitration Between State Org. of Police Officers 
and Cnty. of Kaua#i (SHOPO), 135 Hawai#i 456, 463, 353 P.3d 998,

The one-page Agreement to Participate in Binding 
Arbitration (
Arbitration Agreement) signed by Eichelberger, 
Spear, Jeffers, and the Arbitrator states that at the request of 
the parties, the Arbitrator "agreed to conduct a binding 
arbitration of the matters in controversy between them." The 
3/   HRS § 658A-23(a)(4)(2016) provides: "Upon motion to the court by
a party to an arbitration proceeding, the court shall vacate an award made in
the arbitration proceeding if: . . . [a]n arbitrator exceeded the arbitrator's
powers[.]" (Formatting altered.) 
4  
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Arbitration Agreement further provided that "the Arbitrator shall 
determine all issues submitted to arbitration by the parties and 
may grant any and all remedies that the Arbitrator determines to 
be just and appropriate under the law." 
Eichelberger's complaint sought a declaratory judgment 
"adjudicating the rights and liabilities of the parties to 
ownership and control of [Arnold's, King's] and Ruma . . . ." 
Defendants do not point to anything in the record that restricted 
or limited the Arbitrator's powers in determining the ownership 
of the Businesses or that required the Arbitrator to choose 
between Eichelberger or Spear as the sole owner of the 
Businesses. On this record, we conclude that the Arbitrator did 
not exceed his powers in determining the parties' ownership 
percentages of the Businesses. 
As to Defendants' public policy argument, the following 
analytic framework applies: 
First, the court must determine whether there is an
explicit, well defined, and dominant public policy that is
ascertained by reference to the laws and legal precedents
and not from general considerations of supposed public
interests. Second, the court must determine whether the
arbitration award itself is clearly shown to be contrary to
the explicit, well-defined, and dominant public policy. 
SHOPO, 135 Hawai#i at 465, 353 P.3d at 1007 (internal quotation 
marks and citations omitted; emphases added). 
Defendants argue that the Arbitrator's decision "made 
two persons who could not get along partners, violating public 
policy." 
(Emphasis omitted.) But Defendants do not cite any 
specific Hawai#i law or legal precedent that prohibits persons 
who do not like each other from co-owning a business. Absent an 
"explicit, well defined, and dominant" public policy, Defendants' 
argument fails. 
Defendants also argue that "the [A]rbitrator's decision 
that 75% ownership of Arnold's . . . is awarded to . . . 
Eichelberger orders the Honolulu Liquor Commission [(HLC)] to 
recognize an ownership mandated by the arbitrator and not the 
[HLC]," contrary to the requirements of HRS § 281-41. 
We note, however, that the Arbitrator did not order the 
HLC to do anything. The Partial Final Award, which was 
5   
  
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
incorporated by reference into the Final Award, awarded ownership 
in the Businesses seventy-five percent to Eichelberger, and 
ordered Defendants to restore Eichelberger to her position as 
sole and controlling manager of the Businesses. The Arbitrator 
did not order the HLC to "recognize" any "ownership," did not 
require the HLC to approve the transfer of any liquor license, 
and did not otherwise require any party to violate HRS § 281-41. 
On this record, Defendants have not clearly shown that the Final 
Award was contrary to any explicit, well defined, and dominant 
public policy embodied in HRS § 281-41. 
(2) Defendants contend that "the [A]rbitrator conducted 
the [arbitration] hearing contrary to the provisions of HRS 
§ 658A-15
4/ by: (i) not allowing Defendants to utilize Arnold 
Greene [(Greene)] as a witness when the [A]rbitrator . . . 
advise[d] Greene of his Fifth Amendment constitutional right 
against self-incrimination . . . , where such conduct by the 
[A]rbitrator prejudiced the rights of Defendants under HRS 
§ 658A-23(a)(2)(C)[];
5/ and (ii) . . . not allowing [Defendants] 
to call all of their witnesses at the initial arbitration hearing 
which began on January 23, 2015." (Footnotes added.) 
It is important to note that Defendants do not contend 
that the Arbitrator refused to allow Greene to testify. Rather, 
they argue that when the Arbitrator advised Greene of his Fifth 
Amendment rights, it "had a chilling effect" when Green chose not 
to testify. Defendants cite no Hawai# i authority prohibiting an 
arbitrator from advising a witness of the privilege against self-
incrimination. See Territory of Hawai#i v. Lanier, 40 Haw. 65, 
77 (Haw. Terr. 1953) (recognizing that a judge has discretion to 
advise a witness of the privilege against self-incrimination but 
is not required to do so (citing Republic of Hawai#i v. Parsons, 
10 Hawai#i 601 (Haw. Rep. 1896))). Moreover, Defendants point to 
4/ HRS § 658A-15(d) states that "a party to the arbitration
proceeding has a right to be heard, to present evidence material to the
controversy, and to cross-examine witnesses appearing at the hearing." 
5/ HRS 658A-23(a)(2)(C) provides: "Upon motion to the court by a
party to an arbitration proceeding, the court shall vacate an award made in
the arbitration proceeding if: . . . [t]here was . . . [m]isconduct by an
arbitrator prejudicing the rights of a party to the arbitration proceeding[.]"
(Formatting altered.) 
6   
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
nothing in the record indicating that the Arbitrator's advisement 
amounted to an abuse of discretion in the circumstances of this 
case. 
Defendants make the blanket assertion that the 
Arbitrator did not "allow[ them] to call six witnesses at the 
2015 arbitration hearing." They do not point to where in the 
record they established a ruling by the Arbitrator excluding 
these proposed witnesses, and what offer of proof they made to 
the Arbitrator as to what evidence would be adduced from each of 
them. We are not obligated to search the record for this 
information. Hawaii Ventures, LLC v. Otaka, Inc., 114 Hawai#i 
438, 480, 164 P.3d 696, 738 (2007) (quoting Lanai Co. v. Land Use 
Comm'n, 105 Hawai#i 296, 309 n.31, 97 P.3d 372, 385 n.31 (2004)). 
Additionally, Defendants make no argument on appeal as to how 
they were prejudiced by the Arbitrator's purported ruling. See 
HRAP Rule 28(b)(7). We decline to address Defendants' 
contention, which was not properly preserved or presented. 
(3) Defendants contend that the Arbitrator violated HRS 
§ 658A-23(a)(3)
6/ by failing to postpone the June 13, 2017 hearing 
"when [Eichelberger] provided documents [to Defendants] one day 
before the arbitration hearing and there still was discovery 
outstanding." Defendants assert that they "moved to continue the 
arbitration hearing . . . because [Eichelberger] had only 
provided some of the requested discovery . . . the day before the 
arbitration hearing." They further argue that the Arbitrator, in 
denying Defendants' June 2, 2017 motion for sanctions against 
Eichelberger, "was wrong in asserting that there was no prejudice 
to [Defendants]" caused by Eichelberger's failure to comply with 
the Arbitrator's discovery order. 
Eichelberger argued below, and continues to assert on 
appeal, that Defendants did not actually request a continuance of 
the June 13, 2017 arbitration hearing. The Circuit Court 
concluded that "there was no formal motion to continue the second 
6/ HRS § 658A-23(a)(3) provides: "Upon motion to the court by a
party to an arbitration proceeding, the court shall vacate an award made in
the arbitration proceeding if: . . . [a]n arbitrator refused to postpone the
hearing upon showing of sufficient cause for the postponement . . . ."
(Formatting altered.) 
7  
  
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
arbitration [hearing]" and "no actual request for a continuance, 
although the matter of a continuance was referred to in the 
papers."
7/ 
Even if we assume that Defendants did request a 
continuance of the June 13, 2017 hearing, on appeal, they offer 
no argument as to how they were prejudiced by the claimed denial 
of that request. They argue generally that "documents that were 
essential for the arbitration hearing were not provided by 
Eichelberger," but they do not explain how any specific requested 
documents were material, much less "essential," to Defendants' 
claims or defenses. On this record, we cannot say that the 
Circuit Court erred in denying Defendants' request to vacate in 
part the Final Award based on the alleged failure of the 
Arbitrator to postpone the June 13, 2017 arbitration hearing. 
III. Conclusion 
For the reasons discussed above, we affirm the 
January 24, 2022 "Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part 
'Defendants['] . . . Motion to Confirm in Part and Vacate in Part 
the Final Award of Arbitrator' Filed on December 27, 2017" and 
the April 5, 2022 "Judgment on [Confirmation Order]," both 
entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit.

Associate Judge 
7/ In Defendants' reply in support of their motion for sanctions,
they specifically argued against another continuance, instead urging the
Arbitrator to dismiss Eichelberger's claims. Nevertheless, in a declaration
of counsel supporting Defendants' Motion to Confirm/Vacate, counsel stated
that at the June 13, 2017 hearing on the motion for sanctions, counsel asked
for the arbitration hearing to be continued, and the Arbitrator denied the
request.
