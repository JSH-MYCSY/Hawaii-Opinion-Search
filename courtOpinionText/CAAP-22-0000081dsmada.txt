APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 1CC980005371) 
ORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO DISMISS APPEAL 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and McCullen, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of the Motion to Dismiss for Lack of
Jurisdiction filed on March 14, 2022, and the Amended Motion to 
Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction filed on April 25, 2022 (collectively M

Granting [Receiver]'s Motion to Approve (1) Fourth Amended 
Distribution Analysis; (2) Distribution of Partner Capital Accounts; and (3) Establishing Procedure for Terminating Receivership and Discharging Receiver, Filed October, 22, 2021" (Order Approving Distributions); January 21, 2022 "Order Denying

On October 25, 2010, the circuit court entered a final, 
appealable, Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 54(b)-
certified Partial Final Judgment (10/25/10 Partial Judgment), 
resolving some but not all of the claims in the April 30, 2001 
First Amended Complaint and the July 8, 2002 Supplemental Complaint filed in the underlying action of Civil No. 98-5371-12.
2  See Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-1 (2016), 
HRCP Rule 54, Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai# i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994).  In the 10/25/10 
Partial Judgment, the circuit court stated that its entry of judgment was partial because, 
inter alia, the liquidation process 
was not completed.  The 10/25/10 Partial Judgment states in pertinent part: 
9.  Pursuant to Rule 54(b), Hawaii Rules of Civil
Procedure, all of the Orders listed in the Attached List of
Orders for Final Judgment . . . and the above Judgmentsregarding the monetary damages are entered as a PartialFinal Judgment, as there is no just reason for delay.  The Final Judgment is partial only because the liquidationprocess for [McCully Associates] is not completed and thefinal allocation of Prevailing Parties' Attorneys' Feesshall occur upon the final liquidation of [McCullyAssociates]. 
10.  [Receiver Hayes] shall continue in his role as
Liquidating Receiver and sell the McCully Shopping Centerand the associated real and personal property . . . , andupon such sale, a final accounting shall be completed, whichshall include allocations of costs against the four (4) 
2 As noted in the 10/25/10 Partial Judgment, eight lawsuits by and
between Marn family members had been consolidated in the circuit court, sixhad been dismissed pursuant to certain stipulations, and the 10/25/10 PartialJudgment pertained to the remaining two civil proceedings, Civil No. 98-4706-
10 and Civil No. 98-5371-12.

limited partners of [McCully Associates][.] 
11.  This Court shall retain jurisdiction in
connection with the management and disposition of the
remaining assets of [McCully Associates], including theMcCully Shopping Center and other assets, the winding up of[McCully Associates] and [Ala Wai Investment], distributionand the adjudication of such collateral issues relating tofee requests and tax matters; and 
12.  All other claims asserted in this matter, except
for the remaining accounting issues, including any issuerelated to [Ala Wai Investment], the former general partner,and those matters set forth in paragraph 11, are dismissedwith prejudice. 
This is a Final Judgment on all monetary damage claims
and issues asserted herein pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the
Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure . 
(Emphases added.) 
The Order Approving Distributions and Order Denying 
Reconsideration are interlocutory because they relate to matters 
not adjudicated by the 10/25/10 Partial Judgment and instead that were specifically reserved by the circuit court in the 10/25/10 Partial Judgment.  See Jenkins, 76 Hawai# i at 119, 869 P.2d at 
1338 (holding that an appeal should be dismissed as premature if the judgment does not resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP Rule 54(b)); Cf. Sturkie v. Han, 2 Haw. App. 140, 146, 627 P.2d 296, 301 (1981)(noting that an appeal under HRCP Rule 54(b) "does not divest the trial court of jurisdiction to proceed with the other issues in the case").  The circuit court has not reduced the Order Approving Distributions and Order Denying Reconsideration to a final, appealable judgment. 
In addition, the circuit court's March 30, 2022 Order 
Denying Stay is interlocutory.  In the motion to stay, Alexander appears to have moved the circuit court to stay its Order Approving Distributions, and enforcement of its February 4, 2019 "Order Granting Liquidating Receiver's 65th Application for 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Approval and Payment of Fees and Costs for the Receiver and His 
Professionals for the Period From October/November 2020 Through October 2021, Filed November 19, 2021."  The orders pertain to the winding up of McCully Associates and Ala Wai Investment, which, as discussed, has not been resolved in a final, appealable judgment.  See Jenkins, 76 Hawai# i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. 
Further, the Orders are not independently appealable 
under the collateral-order doctrine, the Forgay doctrine, or HRS ยง 641-1.  See Greer v. Baker, 137 Hawai# i 249, 253, 369 P.3d 
832, 836 (2016) (setting forth the requirements for appealability under the collateral-order doctrine and the Forgay doctrine); HRS ยง 641-1(b) (2016) (setting forth the requirements for appealability under HRS ยง 641-1).  
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motions to 
Dismiss are granted and that CAAP-22-0000081 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions 
in CAAP-22-0000081 are dismissed.
