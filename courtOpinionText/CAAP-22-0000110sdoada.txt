SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Wadsworth and McCullen, JJ.) 
In this secondary appeal, Respondents-Appellants-
Appellants West Sunset 32 Phase 1, LLC, and Charles Somers, as 
Trustee of the Charles Somers Living Trust, (together, Appellants 
or Somers) appeal from the March 8, 2022 Final Judgment (Judgment) entered by the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(Circuit Court)1 in favor of Appellees-Appellees County of Kaua# i 
Planning Commission (Planning Commission), and County of Kaua# i 
Planning Department, by its Director, Ka#aina Hull (Planning 
Department) (together, Kaua# i County), and Petitioner-Appellee-
Appellee Michael A. Kaplan, Trustee of the Michael A. Kaplan 
Revocable Trust (Kaplan), (collectively, Appellees). Appellants 
also challenge the Circuit Court's February 14, 2022 Order 
Granting [Appellees'] Motion to Dismiss Appellants' Notice of Appeal to Circuit Court Filed on October 14, 2021, Filed November 
1, 2021 [DKT 13] (Order Granting Motion to Dismiss). 
Somers raises three points of error on appeal, 
contending that the Circuit Court erred in dismissing the agency appeal in 5CCV-21-0000119 (
Second Agency Appeal) and concluding 
it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review: (1) the 
Planning Commission's denial of Somers's April 5, 2021 (first) 
Petition for Intervention (First Petition to Intervene) on the 
ground that Somers did not timely appeal the Planning 
Commission's May 20, 2021 order denying the First Petition for 
Intervention (Order Denying Intervention); (2) the Planning 
Commission's de facto denial of Somers's September 13, 2021 
(second) Petition for Intervention (Second Petition to 
Intervene); and (3) the Planning Commission's September 14, 2021, 
and September 16, 2021 decisions to approve (a) the August 2021 
1 The Honorable Kathleen N.A. Watanabe presided. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Settlement Agreement between Kaplan, the Planning Commission, and 
the County of Kaua# i (Planning Department) (Settlement 
Agreement), and (b) Kaplan's February 2021 Application for Use 
Permit and Class IV Zoning Permit (
Permit Application). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve Somers's points of error as follows: 
As a preliminary matter, Somers argues that the 
Planning Commission lacked jurisdiction to approve the Settlement Agreement and approve the Permit Application because on September 14 and 16, 2021, a prior agency appeal, taken from the Planning Commission's initial May 20, 2021 decision and order denying the 
Permit Application (Order Denying Permit), was still on appeal 
before the Circuit Court in 5CCV-21-0000057 (
First Agency 
Appeal), and was not dismissed until September 28, 2021. Thus, 
we necessarily consider the circumstances of the First Agency 
Appeal, as well as this Second Agency Appeal. 
After Kaplan submitted the Permit Application to the 
Planning Commission, Somers submitted the First Petition to Intervene, Kaplan opposed it, and after two hearings, the First Petition to Intervene was denied on May 11, 2021. Somers did not appeal the Order Denying Intervention. 
On May 20, 2021, the Planning Commission entered the 
Order Denying Permit, and on June 18, 2021, Kaplan filed a notice 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of appeal in the First Agency Appeal. Somers was not a party to 
that appeal and he did not seek to intervene in the First Agency 
Appeal pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 91-14(b) 
(2012).  In August 2021, a conditional settlement was reached 
between Kaplan, the Planning Commission, and the Planning 
Department, and the Settlement Agreement was read into the record in the First Agency Appeal, although the Circuit Court did not enter any orders related to the Settlement Agreement until September 28, 2021, when it approved the stipulation to dismiss the First Agency Appeal.
3 2
The Settlement Agreement required, inter alia, Kaplan 
to hire an expert to conduct an assessment of certain Native Hawaiian traditional and customary practices that were orally mentioned (not by Somers) at a Planning Commission hearing prior to the Order Denying Petition. The Settlement Agreement further provided that upon receipt of the assessment, the Planning Department would put the Settlement Agreement and the Permit Application on the agenda for the next Planning Commission meeting, along with a further recommendation concerning the Permit Application, including any conditions stemming from the assessment. It was agreed that if the Planning Commission approved the Settlement Agreement, it would also vote on the 
2 HRS § 91-14(b) states, inter alia , that a circuit court "in its
discretion may permit other interested parties to intervene." 
3 Minutes dated August 6, 2021, report the appearances of counsel
for Kaplan and Kaua #i County, by telephone, and state: "Court noted a 
settlement agreement was reached and read into the record." 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Permit Application. If the Permit Application was approved, the 
permits were to be issued immediately, and within two days of the issuance of the permits, Kaplan was to withdraw and dismiss the First Agency Appeal. If the Permit Application was not approved, and the permits were not issued, it was agreed that the Settlement Agreement would be null and void. The Settlement Agreement did not provide for a temporary remand to the Planning Commission, and no order of temporary remand (or other order approving the parties' agreed-upon procedure) was issued by the Circuit Court. 
The assessment was prepared and reviewed. The Planning 
Commission voted to approve the Settlement Agreement effective September 14, 2021, and then voted to approve issuance of Use and Class IV Zoning permits to Kaplan, subject to conditions set forth in a September 16, 2021 letter from the Planning Commission 
(Decision Approving Permits). Counsel then sent a letter 
informing the Circuit Court of what had transpired, and 
thereafter submitted a stipulation to dismiss the First Agency Appeal, which was approved and ordered by the Circuit Court on September 28, 2021. 
The First Agency Appeal was still pending before the 
Circuit Court when the Planning Commission acted on the Settlement Agreement and Permit Application. The Hawai# i Supreme 
Court has long held: 
Generally, the filing of a notice of appeal divests
the trial court of jurisdiction over the appealed case.

State v. Ontiveros, 82 Hawai #i 446, 448–49, 923 P.2d 388,
390–91 (1996); Richardson v. Sport Shinko (Waikiki Corp.),
76 Hawai #i 494, 500, 880 P.2d 169, 175 (1994) (quoting
Territory v. Damon, 44 Haw. 557, 561, 356 P.2d 386, 389(1960)). Jurisdiction over the appealed case is transferredfrom the trial court to the supreme court at the time thenotice of appeal is filed. MDG Supply v. Diversified
Investments, Inc., 51 Haw. 375, 381, 463 P.2d 525, 529(1969), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 868, 91 S.Ct. 99, 27 L.Ed.2d108 (1970). The principle governing the transfer ofjurisdiction from the trial court to the appellate court isdesigned to avoid the confusion and inefficiency that mightflow from placing the same issue before two courts at thesame time. 9 J. Moore, Moore's Federal Practice ¶ 203.11 at5–50 (2d ed.1996). 
Notwithstanding the general effect of the filing of a
notice of appeal, the trial court retains jurisdiction todetermine matters collateral or incidental to the judgment,and may act in aid of the appeal. See, e.g., Foggy v. RalphF. Clark & Assoc., Inc., 192 Cal.App.3d 1204, 238 Cal. Rptr.130 (1987); In re Estate of Rice, 130 Ill. App.3d 416, 85Ill. Dec. 577, 473 N.E.2d 1382 (1985). For example, becausethe mere filing of a notice of appeal does not affect thevalidity of a judgment, the circuit court retainsjurisdiction to enforce the judgment. 
See MDG Supply, 51
Haw. at 381, 463 P.2d at 529; see also Life of the Land v.Ariyoshi, 57 Haw. 249, 252, 553 P.2d 464, 466 (1976) (HRCPRule 60(b) motion for correction, modification, or relieffrom judgment); [Hawaii Rules of Appellante Procedure] Rule10(e) (1996) (providing for correction or modification ofthe record on appeal). 
TSA Int'l Ltd. v. Shimizu Corp., 92 Hawai# i 243, 265, 990 P.2d 
713, 735 (1999) 
These principles have been recognized in the context of 
an appeal to the circuit court (or other appellate court) from an 
appealable order entered by administrative agency. See, e.g., McPherson v. Zoning Bd. of Appeals, 67 Haw. 603, 699 P.2d 26 (1985).  However, there is no clear 
Hawai#i authority applicable 4
4 In McPherson, the supreme court stated: 
Where an administrative agency's regulations permit the
filing of a petition or motion for reconsideration from a decision
and order in what is a contested case under HRS Chapter 91, andsuch a motion is timely filed, it is our express holding that, forthe purposes of an appeal under HRS § 91–14(b), the denial of thepetition or motion for reconsideration is the final decision and
(continued...)

to the particular circumstances of this case. At least one other 
jurisdiction appears to allow an agency to approve (or disapprove) a proposed settlement of a dispute that is on appeal from the agency without a remand to the agency. See Whispering 
Woods at Bamm Hollow, Inc. v. Middletown Twp. Planning Bd., 531 A.2d 770 (N.J. Super. Ct. Law Div. 1987) 
The Planning Commission was both the agency appealed 
from and a party to the appeal. As the Planning Commission was a party to the appeal as well as to the proposed Settlement Agreement, a meeting of the Planning Commission was necessary for the Planning Commission to act on the proposed settlement. The Planning Commission's action on the Settlement Agreement – whether approval or disapproval – could fairly be construed as "an act in aid of the appeal." See TSA Int'l Ltd., 92 Hawai# i at 
265, 990 P.2d at 735. 
Approval of the settlement was necessary 
to terminate the appeal in accordance with the terms of the Settlement Agreement. Disapproval of the settlement would have 
(...continued)
order of the agency. The service of a certified copy of the
denial starts the 30-day appeal period running. 
Any other holding would lead to administrative chaos,
since if an appeal had to be filed prior to the dispositionof a timely motion for reconsideration, the Board would losejurisdiction, and could determine whether or not to grantthe reconsideration only after an express remand from theappellate tribunal, whether it be the circuit court, as inthis case, or the [supreme court], as in certain othercases. 
The waste of time and effort by the parties, their
counsel, the agency and the judiciary in such a situationwould simply be intolerable. 
67 Haw. at 607, 699 P.2d at 29. 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
rendered the Settlement Agreement null and void and signaled the 
need for the Circuit Court to proceed to the merits of the First Agency Appeal. Therefore, the Planning Commission's action on the Settlement Agreement – whether approval or disapproval – could fairly be construed as "an act in aid of the appeal." 
That said, the approval of the Permit Application by 
the Planning Commission was in effect a reversal of the Order Denying Permit, which was of course the order being reviewed on appeal to the Circuit Court. Thus, the Planning Commission's action, without an order of temporary remand, had the potential to create the confusion and inefficiency that might flow from placing the same issue before two tribunals at the same time. 
Finally, we note that the cases above state general 
jurisprudential principles governing the "transfer" of 
jurisdiction from the trial court or agency to the appellate 
court. These principles are intended to avoid inefficiency, waste of time and effort, confusion and chaos, and they are subject to exceptions, including for actions in aid of the appeal. See id.; McPherson, 67 Haw. at 607, 699 P.2d at 29. 
That said, the clear preference of the supreme court in other circumstances has been for an appellate court to issue an order for a temporary remand in aid of its jurisdiction. See State ex
rel. Off. of Consumer Prot. v. Joshua
, 141 Hawai#i 91, 99-100, 
405 P.3d 527, 535-36 (2017);

Apt. Owners , 140 Hawai#i 197, 204, 398 P.3d 786, 793 (2017); Life 
of the Land, 57 Haw. at 251-52, 553 P.2d at 465-66. 
Somers was not a party to the First Agency Appeal in 
part because he was denied intervenor status in the proceeding on 
the Application for Permit. Arguably, he was not aggrieved by the Order Denying Permit, but the outcome of the First Agency Appeal was not a foregone conclusion. We note that Somers declined to appeal the Order Denying Intervention, although it was appealable as a collateral order (as discussed below). Somers further declined to seek intervention in the First Agency Appeal pursuant to HRS § 91-14(b). Although there was no requirement for him to take either action, these were alternative avenues available to him. 
This leads us to consider Somers's argument that the 
Circuit Court erred in concluding that it did not have jurisdiction to review the Order Denying Intervention in the Second Agency Appeal. The supreme court has held that "[a]n order denying an application for intervention under [Hawai# i 
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP)] Rule 24 is a final appealable 
order under HRS § 641-1(a)," and that "[t]he appealability of 
such an order is based upon the collateral order doctrine." Hoopai v. Civ. Serv. Comm'n
, 106 Hawai#i 205, 215, 103 P.3d 365, 
375 (2004). While here, Somers's First Petition to Intervene was 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
brought pursuant to Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Kaua# i 
Planning Commission (RPPPC) § 1-4-1,  not HRCP Rule 24,  the two 
rules are comparable. More importantly, while HRS § 641-1 
(2016)7 is not applicable to Somers's petition, the supreme court 
has determined that a denial of intervention at the agency level is a final order for the purposes of appeal. In re Haw. Gov't Emps.' Ass'n, Loc. 152, 63 Haw. 85, 88, 621 P.2d 361, 364 (1980). Thus, the Planning Commission's Order Denying Intervention was an immediately appealable collateral order. 6 5
5 RPPPC § 1-4-1 provides, in pertinent part: 
1-4-1 Who May Intervene. All Persons who have hold 
interest in the land, who lawfully reside on the land, or
who otherwise can demonstrate that they will be so directlyand immediately affected by the proposed application thattheir interest in the Proceeding is clearly distinguishablefrom that of the general public, shall be admitted asParties-Intervenors upon timely written application forintervention. 
6 HRCP Rule 24 provides, in pertinent part: 
Rule 24. Intervention 
(a) Intervention of Right.  Upon timely application
anyone shall be permitted to intervene in an action: (1)
when a statute confers an unconditional right to intervene;or (2) when the applicant claims an interest relating to theproperty or transaction which is the subject of the actionand the applicant is so situated that the disposition of theaction may as a practical matter impair or impede theapplicant's ability to protect that interest, unless theapplicant's interest is adequately represented by existingparties. 
7 HRS § 641-1 provides, in pertinent part: 
§ 641-1 Appeals as of right or interlocutory, civil
matters. (a) Appeals shall be allowed in civil matters from
all final judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit anddistrict courts and the land court to the intermediate appellate court, subject to chapter 602. 
10 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
That said, "[t]he failure to take an immediate appeal 
from a collateral order does not preclude review of the order on 
appeal from a final judgment." Hoopai
, 106 Hawai#i at 215, 103 
P.3d at 375. Thus, while Somers had the opportunity to immediately appeal the Order Denying Intervention, he was not precluded from seeking review of the Order Denying Intervention when he became aggrieved by the Planning Commission's final 
order, i.e., the Decision Approving Permits. 
See Diamond v. 
Dobbin
, 132 Hawai#i 9, 23, 319 P.3d 1017, 1031 (2014); 
see also 
Bocalbos v. Kapiolani Med. Ctr. for Women & Chil.

second amended decision and order constituted the final decision and order on the matters of medical benefits and temporary disability."); 
NationStar Mortgage, LLC v. Ishihara, 
CAAP-17-0000418, 2018 WL 3425369, *2 (Haw. App. July 16, 2018) (Order Dismissing Appeal) ("When and if the circuit court enters a future amended judgment, any aggrieved party will be able to obtain appellate review of all the interlocutory orders by way of a timely appeal from the future amended judgment under the principle that '[a]n appeal from a final judgment brings up for review all interlocutory orders not appealable directly as of right which deal with issues in the case.'"). 
Somers timely appealed the Decision Approving Permits. 
Therefore, we conclude that the Circuit Court erred in concluding 
11 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that it did not have jurisdiction to review the Order Denying 
Intervention.8 
Finally, Somers argues that the Circuit Court erred in 
concluding that the court lacked jurisdiction to review the Planning Commission's approval of the Settlement Agreement and Decision Approving Permits. The Circuit Court's conclusion was based on its conclusions that it could not review the denial of Somers's petitions to intervene, leaving only Kaplan and Kaua# i 
County as parties to the Permit Application, and no party contesting the matter. As we conclude that the Circuit Court erred in declining to rule on the merits of Kaplan's appeal from the Order Denying Intervention, we necessarily conclude that the Circuit Court erred in concluding that it lacked jurisdiction to review the Planning Commission's approval of the Settlement Agreement and Decision Approving Permits on these grounds. Upon remand, the Circuit Court shall consider whether or not the Planning Commission properly considered the Settlement Agreement and the Permit Application while the First Agency Appeal was still pending, in light of the above. 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's March 8, 2022 
Judgment and February 14, 2020 Order Granting Motion to Dismiss are vacated. This case is remanded to the Circuit Court for 
8 Accordingly, we decline to reach the issues related to Somers's
Second Petition to Intervene, which was not ruled on by the Planning
Commission.
