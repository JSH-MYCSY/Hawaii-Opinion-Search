APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 2CC171000387) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
Mark Allen McMillan, representing himself, appeals from 
the February 16, 2022 Judgment for HSBC Bank USA, National  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Association, entered by the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit.1 
We affirm. 
HSBC filed a foreclosure complaint against McMillan and 
others on September 13, 2017. The circuit court granted HSBC's 
motion for summary judgment and interlocutory decree of foreclosure on November 19, 2019. A Foreclosure Judgment was entered on October 21, 2019.
2 McMillan filed a notice of appeal 
on November 27, 2019. We dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because McMillan's notice of appeal was not filed within 30 days after entry of the Foreclosure Judgment, as required by Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 4(a)(1). 
HSBC Bank USA v. McMillan, No. CAAP-19-0000829, 2020 WL 1903844 (Haw. App. Apr. 17, 2020) (order). 
The circuit court entered an order granting HSBC's 
motion to confirm the foreclosure sale on February 16, 2022. The Judgment (Confirmation of Sale Judgment) was also entered on 
February 16, 2022. This appeal followed. 
McMillan's opening brief states a single point of 
error:
3 "Whether the court erred to proceed with foreclosure 
action without proof [HSBC] were in possession of the original 
Note, upon filing the complaint." McMillan thus challenges HSBC's standing to foreclose. See Bank of Am., N.A. v. 
Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai# i 361, 368, 390 P.3d 1248, 1255 (2017) 
(stating that "a foreclosing plaintiff must establish entitlement to enforce the note at the time the action was commenced"). 
McMillan's appeal from the Foreclosure Judgment was 
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The Foreclosure Judgment is final and binding. HSBC's right to foreclose was finally decided 
1 The Honorable Kelsey T. Kawano presided. 
2 The Honorable Joseph E. Cardoza presided. 
3 The opening brief doesn't comply with Hawai #i Rules of Appellate
Procedure Rule 28(b). To promote access to justice, pleadings prepared by
self-represented litigants are to be interpreted liberally. Erum v. Llego,147 
Hawai #i 368, 380-81, 465 P.3d 815, 827-28 (2020). We don'
t foreclose 
McMillan from appellate review because he failed to comply with court rules. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
in its favor. Res judicata prevents McMillan from challenging 
HSBC's standing to foreclose in this appeal from the Confirmation of Sale Judgment. Mortg. Elec. Registration Sys., Inc. v. Wise, 130 
Hawai#i 11, 17, 304 P.3d 1192, 1198 (2013). 
McMillan makes no other argument why the Confirmation 
of Sale Judgment should be vacated. The February 16, 2022 Judgment for HSBC is affirmed.
