NO.  CAAP-22-0000139 
IN  THE  INTERMEDIATE  COURT  OF  APPEALS 
OF  THE  STATE  OF  HAWAI I 
LOREN  HAMMOND,  aka  LOREN  DALE  HAMMOND  III,  Petitioner-Appellant, 
v.  STATE  OF  HAWAI I,  Respondent-Appellee 
APPEAL  FROM  THE  CIRCUIT  COURT  OF  THE  FIRST  CIRCUIT 
(CASE  NO.  1CPN-21-0000028) 
ORDER  DISMISSING  APPEAL  FOR  LACK  OF  APPELLATE  JURISDICTION 
(By:   Ginoza,  Chief  Judge,  Hiraoka  and  Chan,  JJ.) 
Upon  review  of  the  record,  it  appears  that  we  lack 
appellate  jurisdiction  because  the  notice  of  appeal  filed  by 
self-represented  Petitioner-Appellant  Loren  Hammond ,  aka  Loren  D. 
Hammond  III,  was  filed  on  March  17,  2022,  more  than  thirty  days 
after  entry  of  the  February  8,  2022  order  denying  Hammond's 
Hawai i  Rules  of  Penal  Procedure  Rule  40  Petition.   See  Hawai i 
Rules  of  Appellate  Procedure  Rule  4(a)(1);  Bacon  v.  Karlin,   68 
Haw.  648,  650,  727  P.2d  1127,  1129  (1986)  ("[A]n  appellant's 
failure  to  file  a  timely  notice  of  appeal  is  a  jurisdictional 
defect  that  can  neither  be  waived  by  the  parties  nor  disregarded 
by  the  court  in  the  exercise  of  judicial  discretion.")  (cleaned 
up).          NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Therefore,  IT  IS  HEREBY  ORDERED  that  this  appeal  is 
dismissed  for  lack  of  jurisdiction.   All  pending  motions  are  also 
dismissed.
