APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT  
(CASE NO. 1DV201006681)  
SUMMARY DISPOSITION  ORDER  
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Wadsworth and Guidry, JJ.)

Plaintiff -Appellant Jaime Eduardo Quiros (Husband) appeals from     
 
  
 
   
 
 
  
  
   
 
   
 
   
 
     
 
 
     
   
    
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the Family Court of the First Circuit's ( family court)1 (1) Order 
Denying Husband's Motion for Reconsideration and/or for 
Amendment of the December 13, 2021 Order, filed on February 16, 
2022 (February 2022 Order ); (2) Order Regarding Defendant -
Appellee Stephanie Ann Quiros's ( Wife) Motion and Declaration 
for Post -Decree Relief, filed on June 1, 2022 ( June 2022 Order ); 
and (3) Order Denying Husband's Motion for Reconsideration 
and/or for Amendment of the June 1, 2022 Order, filed on 
July 26, 2022 ( July 2022 Order ). 
Husband appears to make four arguments on appea l,2 
contending that the family court erred as to : (1) "the Division 
of property of marital debt of $ 6,201.00 "; (2) "[Husband's] 
request to change alimony due to loss of job"; (3) the "TRO"; 
and (4) its failure to hold Wife in contempt for her failure to 
"file [an] income and expense [statement] as required ." Upon 
careful review of the record , briefs, and relevant legal 
authorit ies, we address Husband's arguments as follows : 
1 The Honorable Bryant Zane and the Honorable Courtney N. Naso 
presided. 
2 These arguments appear in the Statement of the Case and "Issue[s] 
Raised" sections in Husband's "Informal Opening Brief, " filed in CAAP -22-
0000147. Husband's "Pro Se Appellant's Opening Brief," filed in CAAP -22-
0000505, generally asks this court to "open and relook at this case" but does 
not set forth any discernible issues for review. 
We note that self-represented Husband's briefs are in many ways 
substantially non -compliant with the requirements of Hawaiʻi Rules of 
Appellate Procedure ( HRAP) Rule 28. Among other things, Husband's opening 
briefs do not set forth "points of error" in compliance with HRAP Rule 
28(b)(4) .

(1) "Generally, the family court possesses wide 
discretion in making its decisions and those decisions will not 
be set aside unless there is a manifest abuse of discretion." 
Brutsch v. Brutsch, 139 Hawaiʻi 373, 381, 390 P.3d 1260, 1268 
(2017)  (citation omitted). Husband makes no discernible 
argument as to how the family court abused its discretion in its 
"property division of  marital debt."   We thus exercise our 
authority to "disregard a particular contention if the appellant makes no discernible argument in support of that position." In 
re Guardianship of Carlsmith, 113 Hawai ʻi 236, 246, 151 P.3d 717, 
727 (2007) (cleaned up).  
(2) Husband next appears to challenge the family 
court's entry of its February 2022, June 2022 , and July 2022 
Orders. 
We first address Husband's contention that the family 
court abused its discretion in entering its February 2022 Order 
denying reconsideration of the spousal support award.3 "[Hawaii 
Revised Statutes] § 580-47(d) [(2018)] provides for future 
modification of spousal support orders upon a showing of 
material changes in circumstances or other good cause." 
3 The family court awarded spousal support to Wife in its Divorce 
Decree, filed on July 16, 2021, and denied Husband's July 30, 2021 post -
decree motion to modify the spousal support award in its Order Denying 
Husband's Motion for Post-Decree Relief, filed on December 13, 2021. Husband 
did not appeal either ruling.

Jacoby  v. Jacoby, 134 Hawaiʻi 431, 446, 341 P.3d 1231, 1246 (App. 
2014).    
It appears that Husband's motion for reconsideration 
of the spousal support award alleged a loss of employment that 
occurred prior to  the family court's issuance of the  July 16, 
2021 Divorce Decree, and the  December 13, 2021 Order Denying 
Husband's Motion for Post-Decree Relief.   "The purpose of a 
motion for reconsideration is to allow the parties to present new evidence and/or arguments that could not have been presented 
during the earlier adjudicated motion." Tagupa v. Tagupa, 108 
Hawai‛i 459, 465, 121 P.3d 924, 930 (App. 2005)  (cleaned up).   
The loss of employment evidence that Husband relies upon as a 
basis for modification of the spousal support award was known to 
Husband at the time the family court considered  Husband's motion 
for post-decree relief.   See  id.  ("Reconsideration is not a 
device to relitigate old matters or to raise arguments or 
evidence that could and should have been brought during the 
earlier proceeding.")  (citation omitted).   We therefore conclude 
that the family court did not abuse its discretion in issuing 
its February 2022 Order denying Husband's motion for 
reconsideration.     4
4 Husband produced exhibits showing that he was terminated from his 
employment at Joint Base Pearl Harbor – Hickam effective April 24, 2021, and 
from his employment with JN Group effective April 8, 2021.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
We next address Husband's contention that default was 
erroneously granted with regard to Wife's request for 
enforcement of the spousal support award . The family court's 
June 2022 Order awarded spousal support arrearages to Wife on 
the basis of Husband "inexcusably fail[ing] to appear" at the 
hearing, and the July 2022 Order denied Husband's motion for 
reconsideration of the June 2022 Order. We construe self-
represented Husband's July 2022 motion for reconsideration as a 
Hawaiʻi Family Court Rules ( HFCR) Rule 55(c) motion to set aside 
Husband's default . 
Pursuant to HFCR  Rule 55(c), "[f]or good cause shown 
the court may set aside an entry of default[.]"   See  also  
Chen  v. Mah, 146 Hawaiʻi 157, 177 & n.21, 457 P.3d 796, 816 &  
n.21 (2020) (holding that HFCR Rule 55(c) motions "are governed 
only by the  plain language  'good cause'  standard explicitly 
stated in the rule").   It  is not clear from the record and the 
July 2022 Order that the family court applied the good cause  
standard  in evaluating Husband's contentions.   We therefore  
vacate the family court's July 2022 Order and remand with 
instructions that the family court  apply  the good cause standard 
in its consideration of Husband's contentions. If the family 5 
5 Husband alleged that he appeared at the courthouse for the June 
2022 hearing, but that he was denied entry into the courtroom because he was 
told he was " too late." The family court's July 2022 Order summarily denied 
Husband's request to set aside his default. 
5     
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
court finds good cause that warrants setting aside the default, 
the family court should then reconsider , on the merits of 
Husband's argument, its June 2022 Order granting Wife's motion 
for spousal support arrearages. 
(3) To the extent that Husband is challenging the  
"TRO," it appears that Husband is referencing a temporary 
restraining order that was issued in a separate case, FC-DA 20-
1-2711. Any order issued in FC-DA 20-1-2711 is not a part of 
the record of this case, and it is not appealed here. We 
therefore do not review the "TRO."  
(4)  We find lacking in merit Husband's  argument  that 
the  family court erred in "fail[ing] to hold [Wife] in contempt 
of court [for] failing to file the income and expense 
[statement][as] required," and that Husband  was therefore "not 
provide[d]  with such information and . . . could not dispute 
some of the false information submitted."    
The record reflects that the family court ordered 
Husband and Wife to "drop off their exhibits at the Kapolei 
Courthouse by November 17, 2021 for exchange to [the] other 
party and for the Court to receive its copies" in advance of its 
continued December 1, 2021 hearing on Husband's motion for post -
decree relief. Both Husband and Wife's updated Income and 
Expense Statements were filed on November 17, 202 1, and Husband 
has not shown that he did not receive Wife's filings or that he

was unable to dispute "false information" presented by Wife. It 
appears that Husband was present for the hearing on his motion 
for post -decree relief , and the family court took Husband's 
motion and the parties' submissions into consideration in its 
ruling. 6 
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the family 
court's February 2022 Order and June 2022 Order, but we vacate 
the family court's July 2022 Order and remand for further 
proceedings consistent with this summary disposition order .

6 The record does not include any transcripts, but it reflects that 
Husband was present at the December 1, 2021 hearing, which was held after 
Wife filed her updated Income and Expense Statement on November 17, 202 1. 
The family court's December 13, 2021 Order Denying Husband's 
Motion for Post -Decree Relief, which was not appealed by Husband, provides 
that "[a]fter taking judicial notice of the records and files of this case 
and after considering [Husband's] motion, th e credible and reliable evidence 
presented, and the applicable law, this [c]ourt hereby denies [Husband's] 
Motion for Post -Decree Relief in its entirety."
