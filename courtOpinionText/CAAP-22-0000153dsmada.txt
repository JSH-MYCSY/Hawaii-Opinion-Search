IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI#I 
ALICE ANDRADE DALOMBA, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
JASON RAY MUELLER, Defendant-Appellant;
VILLAGE OF KAPOLEI ASSOCIATION; FIRST HAWAIIAN BANK,
and DOES 1-50, Defendants-Appellees. 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 1CC161001468) 
ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and Nakasone, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of the Motion to Dismiss for Lack of 
Jurisdiction (
Motion), filed on March 31, 2022, by Plaintiff-
Appellee Alice Andrade Dalomba, the papers in support and in 
opposition, and the record, it appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction over Defendant-Appellant Jason Ray Mueller's (Mueller) appeal from the Circuit Court of the First Circuit's 
(circuit court) March 17, 2022 "Order Granting in Part and 
Denying in Part [Dalomba]'s Motion for Partition by Sale, Filed 
February 7, 2022" (Order) because the circuit court has not 
entered a final, appealable judgment, and the Order is not 
independently appealable. 
An aggrieved party cannot obtain appellate review of a 
circuit court's interlocutory orders in a civil case, under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-1(a) (2016), until the 
circuit court has reduced its dispositive rulings to an NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appealable, final judgment under Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure 
Rule 58. Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai# i 
115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). Here, the circuit court 
has not entered a final, appealable judgment. 
Further, the Order is not independently appealable
 
under the collateral-order doctrine or HRS ยง 641-1(b). See Greer 
v. Baker, 137 Hawai# i 249, 253, 369 P.3d 832, 836 (2016) 
(reciting the requirements for appeals under the collateral-order doctrine); HRS ยง 641-1(b) (2016) (reciting the requirements for leave to file an interlocutory appeal); see also Lambert v. Teisina, 131 Hawai# i 457, 462 n.11, 319 P.3d 376, 381 n.11 (2014) 
("[A]n order appointing a commissioner and directing a partition sale (e.g., a partition decree) is an interlocutory order that is not appealable unless allowed by the trial judge."). 
In addition, the Order is not independently appealable 
under the Forgay
 doctrine because it does not confirm the sale of 
the subject property (Property), direct the distribution of sale 
proceeds, or direct Mueller to surrender his interest in the 
Property within a specified time period. See Greer, 137 Hawai# i 
at 253, 369 P.3d at 836 (reciting the requirements for appeals under the Forgay doctrine); see also Fernandes v. D. Napua Law, No. CAAP-18-0000331, 2018 WL 4784076, at *2 (App. Oct. 4, 2018) (interlocutory order adopting commissioner's report and directing partition of real property, and interlocutory order denying motion for reconsideration of order, was not appealable under Forgay doctrine because it did not (1) require immediate execution of command that property be delivered to appellants' adversary, and (2) appellants would not be subjected to irreparable injury if appellate review had to wait final outcome of litigation); cf. Lambert, 131 Hawai# i at 462, 319 P.3d at 381 
(interlocutory order confirming partition sale and directing distribution of sale proceeds was appealable under Forgay doctrine because it confirmed sale of property, directed

commissioner to convey property to trustee, and ordered parties 
to surrender property within thirty days of conveyance). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is 
granted and the appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
