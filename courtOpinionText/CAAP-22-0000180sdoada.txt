IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS  
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI‘I  
STATE OF 
HAWAI‘I, Plaintiff-Appellee,  
v.  
CRYSTAL MAE SMYTHE, Defendant-Appellant  
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT  
WAILUKU DIVISION  
(CASE NO. 2DTC-21-612706)  
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By:   Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and Guidry, JJ.)  
Defendant -Appellant Crystal Mae Smythe (Smythe) 
appeals from the Judgment and Notice of Entry of Judgment 
(Judgment ) entered on February 25, 2022 by the District Court of 
the Second Circuit for driving without a valid driver's license 
in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes § 286 -102 (2020). 1 
Smythe raises a single argument on appea l,2 contending 
that the State failed to show that Officer Jun Hattori had 
1 The Honorable Christopher M. Dunn presided. 
2   We note that the brief does not contain points of error, nor does 
it state "where in the record the alleged error was objected to or the manner 
in which the alleged error was brought to the attention of the court[,]" as 
required under Hawai ʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(4) .     
 
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
     
   
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
probable cause to issue a citation to Smythe because Smythe 
presented a "Kingdom of Hawaii license[.]" Upon careful review 
of the record , briefs, and relevant legal authorities , and 
having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the 
issues raised by the parties, we conclude that Smythe's 
contention is waived. 
It appears that the issue of probable cause was not 
raised by Smythe prior to trial, and was therefore waived . See 
Hawaiʻi Rules of Penal Procedure ( HRPP) Rule 12(b)(1) ("The 
following [motions] must be raised prior to trial : (1) defenses 
and objections based on defects in the institution of the 
prosecution[.]"). A party's failure to raise such objections 
"shall constitute waiver thereof [.]" HRPP Rule 12( f). 
We therefore affirm the Judgment. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawaiʻi, January 29,  2025.
