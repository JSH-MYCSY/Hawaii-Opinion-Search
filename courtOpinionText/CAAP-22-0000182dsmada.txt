NO.  CAAP-22-0000182 
IN  THE  INTERMEDIATE  COURT  OF  APPEALS 
OF  THE  STATE  OF  HAWAI I 
ANNIE  M.  AEA,  Claimant/Appellant-Appellant,  v. 
KIEWIT  INFRASTRUCTURE  CO.,  Employer/Appellee-Appellee,  and 
GALLAGHER  BASSETT  SERVICES,  INC., 
Insurance  Carrier/Appellee-Appellee 
APPEAL  FROM  THE  LABOR  AND  INDUSTRIAL  RELATIONS  APPEAL  BOARD 
(CASE  NO.  AB  2020-140;  DCD  NO.  2-15-06201) 
ORDER  DISMISSING  APPEAL 
(By:   Leonard,  Acting  Chief  Judge,  Hiraoka  and  Guidry,  JJ.) 
Upon
 review of the record, it appears that: 
(1) On March 24, 2022, Claimant/Appellant-Appellant 
Annie M. Aea (Aea) filed the notice of appeal self-represented; 
(2) On May 23, 2022, Aea filed the statement of 
jurisdiction self-represented and Aea's counsel filed a motion to 
withdraw as counsel; 
(3) On
 June 23, 2022, the appellate clerk entered a 
default of the opening brief, notifying Aea that the time for 
filing the opening brief expired on June 22, 2022, and cautioning 
Aea that the appeal could be dismissed for failure to file the 
opening brief, under Hawai i Rules  of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 
Rule 30. The appellate clerk mailed a copy of the default notice 
to Aea at her address on record; 
(4) On June 29, 2022, the court granted Aea's counsel's 
motion to withdraw as counsel, extended the opening brief 
deadline to August 8, 2022, and ordered the appellate clerk to          
             
  
         
        
           
            
            
        
     NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
mail a copy of the order to Aea at her mailing address listed in 
counsel's motion; and 
(5) The appellate clerk complied with the June 29, 2022 
order, and Aea subsequently filed several documents in this 
appeal, none of which could be construed as the opening brief or 
a motion for extension of time for the opening brief. Thus, Aea 
is in default of the opening brief for a second time in this 
appeal. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed. See HRAP
 Rule 30. 
DATED:   Honolulu,  Hawai i,  February  28,  2025.
