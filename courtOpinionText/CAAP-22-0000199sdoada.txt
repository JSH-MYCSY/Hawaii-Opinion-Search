(CASE NO. 3DSS-22-0000001) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Wadsworth, Presiding Judge, and Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
In these consolidated appeals, self-represented 
Respondent-Appellant Timothy Williams (
Williams) appeals from the 
March 17, 2022 Order Granting Petition for Injunction Against 
Harassment (Injunction), and the April 26, 2022 Order for 
Attorney's Fees (Fee Order), both entered by the District Court 
of the Third Circuit, North and South Hilo Divisions (District 
Court)./ The Injunction restrained and enjoined Williams from, 1
1/   The Honorable M. Kanani Laubach presided. 
On March 28, 2022, Williams filed a notice of appeal from the
Injunction, initiating appellate case number CAAP-22-0000199. 
On May 10, 
2022, Williams filed a notice of appeal from the Fee Order, initiating
appellate case number CAAP-22-0000322. On January 17, 2023, this courtentered an order consolidating CAAP-22-0000199 and CAAP-22-0000322 under CAAP-22-0000199.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
among other things, contacting, threatening, or harassing 
Petitioner-Appellee Patrick Ehrenlechner (Ehrenlechner) and 
minors L.E. and B.E. for a period of three years. The Fee Order 
awarded Ehrenlechner attorney's fees and costs in the amount of $2,913.84 as against Williams. 
On appeal Williams contends that the District Court 
abused its discretion by: (1) denying Williams's March 17, 2022 Non-Hearing Motion for Continuance (Motion to Continue); and (2) 
"citing the wrong statute of law" in granting Ehrenlechner's 
April 12, 2022 request for attorney's fees and costs (Fee 
Request). 
As a threshold matter, we note that Williams's opening 
briefs do not comply in material respects with Hawai# i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP
) Rule 28(b). In particular, Williams 
makes numerous factual assertions and arguments without any 
supporting references to the record. See HRAP Rule 28(b)(4), 
(7). Williams also improperly appends documents to his opening brief in CAAP-22-0000199 that are not part of the record.

information and/or information filed under seal in another case pursuant toRule 9 of the 
Hawai #i Court Records Rules ( HCRR). Ehrenlechner requests that
these documents be stricken and/or sealed. Because these documents are not part of the record, they will be stricken. See DW Aina Le #a Development, LLC

also be sealed. See HCRR Rules 2.19, 9.1; Oahu Publications Inc. v. Takase,139 Hawai #i 236, 247-48, 386 P.3d 873, 884-85 (2016); Roy v. Gov't Emps. Ins.

apparent basis in the record. We disregard assertions made 
without such a basis, as well as appended documents that are not part of the record. 
After reviewing the record on appeal and the relevant 
legal authorities, and giving due consideration to the issues raised and the arguments advanced by the parties, we resolve Williams's contentions as follows, and affirm. 
(1) Williams contends that the District Court should 
have granted his Motion to Continue the evidentiary hearing on the Petition. He argues that "the restraining orders in effect could have been extended, [and] there was no prejudice." 
"We review a trial court's decision to grant or deny a 
motion to continue for an abuse of discretion." Onaka v. Onaka, 
112 Hawai# i 374, 378, 146 P.3d 89, 93 (2006); see DJ v. CJ, 147 
Hawai#i 2, 16, 464 P.3d 790, 804 (2020) (citing Onaka). "It is 
well established that 'an abuse of discretion occurs if the trial court has clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party-litigant.'" Onaka, 112 Hawai# i at 378, 146 
P.3d at 93 (brackets omitted). 
On January 3, 2022, Ehrenlechner filed a Petition for 
Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order and for Injunction Against Harassment, individually and on behalf of L.E. and B.E., pursuant to HRS § 604-10.5. On January 4, 2022, the District Court entered a Temporary Restraining Order Against Harassment (TRO) as 
to Williams. The TRO was later extended by court order several 
times, including on March 3, 2022, when the District Court extended the TRO and continued the evidentiary hearing to March 17, 2022. 
Williams filed the Motion to Continue on the morning of 
March 17, 2022, the scheduled evidentiary hearing date. The motion stated that "Williams wishes to hire other counsel" and pointed out that an earlier motion for a continuance filed by 
3   
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Ehrenlechner had been granted.3/ At the March 17 hearing, 
Williams's then-counsel explained to the court that Williams had 
"fired" him the prior day, and counsel had prepared the Motion to Continue the prior evening. Ehrenlechner opposed the motion, stating that he had "expended considerable resources to prepare for this morning. . . . We have witnesses. People have taken time off from work." (Formatting altered.) Ehrenlechner also confirmed for the court that two of the witnesses, the "minor children," were there to testify. 
The District Court denied the Motion to Continue, 
stating in part: "I'm gonna deny your request to continue. I cannot. The time period [for expiration of the relevant temporary restraining order] is shortly coming up
4/ and the 
children are here today so I'm gonna deny your request to continue." (Footnote added.) The court then excused Williams's counsel and proceeded with the hearing, after first confirming that (a) Williams still wanted "to fire" his counsel, (b) Williams's counsel had given Williams his entire file, (c) Williams had received or had had access to Ehrenlechner's previously delivered hearing exhibits, and (d) Ehrenlechner would allow Williams to review a courtesy copy of the exhibits. 
Williams argues that he was not ready to proceed on 
March 17, 2022, for various reasons. He makes numerous factual assertions without supporting references to the record, including 
3/ On February 23, 2022, Ehrenlechner filed a motion to continue the
evidentiary hearing, then scheduled for March 3, 2022. Williams had no 
objection to the motion, and the evidentiary hearing was continued toMarch 17, 2022. 
4/ Under HRS § 604-10.5(g), "[a] temporary restraining order that is
granted under this section shall remain in effect at the discretion of thecourt for a period not to exceed ninety days from the date the order isgranted . . . ." 
We note that, about a year after the March 17, 2022 hearing, the
Hawai #i Supreme Court held that "if a district court has commenced hearing
the merits of an HRS § 604-10.5 injunction petition but, despite reasonableefforts, it is unable to conclude the hearing within ninety days of issuanceof the 
ex parte TRO, it has jurisdiction and discretion to continue the TRO
pending its final decision on the injunction petition, if standards forissuance of temporary injunctive relief are met" because "the continued TRO isno longer ex parte." Meyer v. Basco
, 152 Hawai #i 281, 289-90, 526 P.3d 258,
266-67 (2023).

many assertions that find no apparent support in the record. See 
supra. 
We conclude, on this record, that the District Court 
did not abuse its discretion in denying the Motion to Continue 
the hearing on the Petition. 
(2) The District Court awarded Ehrenlechner attorney's 
fees and costs pursuant to HRS § 604-10.5(h). Williams contends that the District Court abused its discretion by "citing the wrong statute of law" in granting the Fee Request. Williams's argument is conclusory, but appears to challenge the court's authority to award fees under HRS § 604-10.5(h) in these circumstances. 
HRS § 604-10.5(h) states: "The court may grant the 
prevailing party in an action brought under this section costs and fees, including attorney's fees." "[A]n action brought under this section[,]" i.e., HRS § 604-10.5, includes a petition brought to obtain a temporary restraining order or injunction against harassment. See HRS § 604-10.5(c); see also LeMay v. Leander, 92 
Hawai#i 614, 627, 994 P.2d 546, 559 (2000) ("The 
plain language of HRS § 604-10.5(g), when read in the context of the entire statute, applies . . . to proceedings to procure a temporary retraining order or injunction pursuant to HRS § 604-10.5 . . . ."). Accordingly, the District Court did not err in citing or relying on HRS § 604-10.5(h) as the statutory basis for awarding costs and fees to Ehrenlechner in this action. 
For the reasons discussed above, we affirm the 
March 17, 2022 Order Granting Petition for Injunction Against Harassment, and the April 26, 2022 Order for Attorney's Fees, entered by the District Court of the Third Circuit, North and South Hilo Division. 
Further, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED as follows: 1. The appellate clerk shall strike from the record 
on appeal in CAAP-22-0000199 the documents appended to Williams's opening brief, designated as Exhibits "U" and "V," at dockets 32 and 34. 
2. The appellate clerk shall seal in CAAP-22-0000199 
the documents appended to Williams's opening brief, designated as

Exhibits "U" and "V," at dockets 32 and 34. 
3. Within ten (10) days from the date of this summary 
disposition order, any individual may file a motion objecting to 
the sealing of the identified documents.
