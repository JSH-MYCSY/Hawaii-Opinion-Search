IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
DWIGHT J. VICENTE, Claimant-Appellant-Appellant, v.
HILO MEDICAL INVESTORS, LTD., Employer-Appellee-Appellee, and
AMERICAN HOME ASSURANCE COMPANY/AIG CLAIMS SERVICES,
Insurance Carrier-Appellee-Appellee, and JOHN MULLEN & COMPANY,
INC., Insurance-Adjuster-Appellee-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD 
(CASE NO. AB 2015-259(H)(S); DCD NO. 1-87-00882) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and Chan, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
appellate jurisdiction over self-represented Claimant-Appellant-
Appellant Dwight J. Vicente's (
Vicente) appeal from a purported 
order denying Vicente's motion to continue trial by the Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board (LIRAB), in Case No. 2015
-
259(H)(S), because the record on appeal in CAAP-22-0000245 does not include a final decision or order by the LIRAB regarding its review of a June 3, 2015 decision by the Director of the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations regarding Vicente's claim for further workers' compensation benefits for a May 3, 1987 injury. 
An aggrieved party may appeal from a final decision and 
order by the LIRAB directly to this court under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 386-88 (2015) and 91-14 (2012). For purposes 
of HRS § 91-14(a), "final order" means "an order ending the 
proceedings, leaving nothing further to be accomplished[;] . . . Consequently, an order is not final if the rights of a party NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
involved remain undetermined or if the matter is retained for 
further action." Bocalbos v. Kapiolani Med. Ctr. for Women & 
Child., 89 Hawai# i 436, 439, 974 P.2d 1026, 1029 (1999) (cleaned 
up). 
No final judgment has been entered in the underlying 
proceeding. Absent an appealable, final decision or order in LIRAB Case No. 2015-259(H)(S), the appeal is premature and we lack jurisdiction. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate case 
number CAAP-22-0000245 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, November 7, 2022.
