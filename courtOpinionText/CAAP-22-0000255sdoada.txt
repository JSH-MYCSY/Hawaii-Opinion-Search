v.  
HENRY K. TOLENTINO, Defendant-Appellant  
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT  
(CASE NO. 1CPC-19-0001524)  
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION  ORDER  
(By:   Wadsworth, Presiding Judge, McCullen and Guidry, JJ.)  
Defendant -Appellant Henry K. Tolentino ( Tolentino ) 
appeals from the "Judgment of Conviction and Sentence " 
(Judgment ), filed on March 9, 2022 in the Circuit Court of the 
First Circuit ( circuit court ).1 
1 The Honorable Rowena A. Somerville presided.   
 
 
   
   
 
 
  
 
 
   
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On October 17, 2019, the State of Hawaiʻi (State) 
charged Tolentino, via grand -jury indictment, with assault 
against a law enforcement officer in the first degree, in 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 707-712.5(1)(a) 
(2014).2 On December 10, 2021, a jury found Tolentino "[g]uilty 
of the included offense of Assault Against a Law Enforcement 
Officer in the Second Degree." The sentencing hearing took 
place in March 2022, and the circuit court entered the Judgment. 
This appeal followed. 
Tolentino raises five points of error on appeal : (1) 
the circuit court erred when it allowed the State to use 
Tolentino's out -of-court statement at trial ; (2) "[t]he [circuit 
c]ourt erred where it denied [Tolentino's] motion in limine" 
which sought to exclude evidence "that [Tolentino] consumed 
alcohol just prior to the incident" and when it allowed the 
State to "make the legal conclusion" during closing arguments 
that Tolentino was drunk despite insufficient evidence ; (3) 
"[t]he [circuit c]ourt erred where it denied [Tolentino 's] 
2 The Indictment states, in relevant part : 
On or about September 21, 2019, in the City and 
County of Honolulu, State of Hawaiʻi, HENRY K. TOLENTINO did 
intentionally or knowingly cause bodily injury to  [Officer]  
Kenneth Fontes Jr.  [(Officer Fontes )],  a law enforcement 
officer who was engaged in the performance of duty, thereby 
committing the offense of Assault Against a Law Enforcement 
Officer in the First Degree, in violation of Section 707 -
712.5(1)(a) of the Hawai ʻi Revised Statutes.

request for an extra peremptory [challenge]"  after  the circuit 
court denied Tolentino's challenge of a juror for cause; (4) 
"[t]he [circuit c]ourt erred by sustaining [Tolentino's] 
'reckless' conviction despite insufficient evidence supporting 
'reckless' conduct"; and (5) "[Tolentino's] lower court counsel  
[(defense counsel)]  was ineffective for failing to move for a 
judgment [of acquittal]  where there was insufficient evidence to 
sustain a conviction for 'reckless' assault on a police 
officer."  
Upon careful review of the record , briefs, and 
relevant legal authorities , and having given due consideration 
to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties , 
we resolve Tolentino's points of error as follows : 
(1) Tolentino first contends that the circuit court 
committed a " [f]ailure of [p]rocess" when it ruled that the 
State could present evidence of Tolentino's out -of-court 
statement,3 which could be construed as a confession or an 
inculpatory statement, without first conducting a voluntariness 
hearing. 
"It is well established that a criminal conviction may 
not be based on an involuntary confession." State v. Goers , 
61 Haw. 198, 199, 600 P.2d 1142, 1143 (1979) (citation omitted). 
3   The out- of-court statement is "I'm sorry, I was trying to get a 
Zip Pac."   
3   
 
 
   
 
  
 
   
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
   
    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRS § 621-26 (2016) provides that "[n]o confession[4] shall be 
received in evidence unless it is first made to appear to the 
judge before whom the case is being tried that the confession 
was in fact voluntarily made." HRS § 621 -26 does not expressly 
require the trial judge to hold a voluntariness hearing, but the 
trial judge must make a voluntariness determination before the 
statement is admitted and without the jury present . See 
State v. Hopkins , No. CAAP -19-0000408, 2021 WL 4167382, at *3 
(Haw. App. Sept. 14, 2021) (SDO); State v. Green , 51 Haw. 260, 
264, 457 P.2d 505, 508 (1969) . 
Here, the circuit court made a voluntariness 
determination at trial before evidence of the out -of-court 
statement was admitted and outside the presence of the jury . 5 
Therefore, the circuit court did not err by not conducting a 
separate voluntariness hearing.6 
4   This court ha s  held that HRS § 621 -26  also  applies to inculpatory 
statements. State v. Hewitt, 149 Hawaiʻ i 71, 76, 481 P.3d 713, 718 (App. 
2021).  
5   Specifically, the circuit court determined, on the evidence  
before it,  that "there was no coercion, and there was no question asked by 
Officer Fontes when [Tolentino] made the unsolicited excited utterance." The 
circuit court made a similar determination when it heard the parties' motions 
in limine.  
6 Tolentino also asserts that the circuit court erred in allowing 
the out-of-court statement because the State had requested to exclude the use 
of Tolentino's out -of-court statements in its motion in limine. We note that 
the State requested to "[e]xclude and preclude from use at trial any out -of-
court statements made by [Tolentino] which may be elicited by the defense and 
which are inadmissible under the 'admission by party opponent' exception to 
the hearsay rule." (Emphasis added.) It did not move to exclude statements 
that it would introduce at trial. Thus, this argument lacks merit .

(2) Tolentino next contends that the circuit court 
erred in partially denying his motion in limine when it allowed 
the State to present evidence that Tolentino consumed alcohol 
prior to his encounter with Officer Fontes. We review the 
circuit court's ruling on a motion in limine for abuse of 
discretion. State v. Kealoha, 95 Hawaiʻi 365, 379, 22 P.3d 1012, 
1026 (App. 2000). "An abuse of discretion occurs when the court 
clearly exceeds the bounds of reason or disregards rules or 
principles of law to the substantial detrimen t of a party 
litigant." State v. Cordeiro , 99 Hawaiʻi 390, 404, 56 P.3d 692, 
706 (2002) (cleaned up). 
Hawaii Rules of Evidence ( HRE) Rule 404(b) states that 
"[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible 
to prove the character of a person in order to show action in 
conformity therewith." The rule, however, allows such evidence 
when it "is probative of another fact that is of consequence to 
the determination of the action, such as proof of motive." HRE 
Rule 404(b). 
Here, it appears that testimonial evidence that 
Tolentino consumed alcohol was not introduced to prove 
Tolentino's character, but rather to support the State's theory 
that Tolentino assaulted Officer Fontes in his attempt to evade 
arrest because he did not want to be caught drinking and

    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
driving. Therefore, the circuit court did not abuse its 
discretion in denying Tolentino's motion on this basis . 
Tolentino further contends that such evidence should 
not have been admitted , under HRE Rule 403, because "its 
probative value [was] outweighed by the prejudicial effect of 
the evidence." We review the circuit court's "balancing of the 
probative value of prior bad act evidence against the 
prejudicial effect of such evidence under HRE Rule 403" under 
the abuse of discretion standard. State v. Feliciano , 149 
Hawaiʻi 365, 372, 489 P.3d 1277, 1284 (2021) (citation s omitted). 
When weighing the probative value of the evidence against its 
prejudicial effect, the circuit court consider s the following 
factors: 
(1) the strength of the evidence as to the commission of 
the other crime[;] (2) the similarities between the 
crimes[;] (3) the interval of time that has elapsed between 
the crimes[;] (4) the need for the evidence [;] (5) the 
efficacy of alternative proof[;] and (6) the degree to 
which the evidence probably will rouse the jury to 
overmastering hostility.[7] 
Id. at 376-77, 489 P.3d at 1288 -89 (cleaned up ). 
Here, it appears the circuit court found a sufficient 
need to admit evidence that Tolentino consumed alcohol  when it 
stated that such evidence would go to Tolentino's "state of mind 
7 These factors are meant only to provide guidance, and the court's 
overall evaluation must be "whether the probative value of the evidence of 
prior acts is substantially outweighed by its potential for unfair 
prejudice." Feliciano , 149 Hawai ʻi at 377, 489 P.3d at 128 9 (citation 
omitted). " Each factor must therefore be considered in light of the purpose 
for which the evidence was offered[.]" Id. (citation omitted).

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and his motive for trying to get away [from the police] at all 
costs." Considering  the difficulty of establishing a  
defendant's state of mind by direct evidence, the circuit court here did not err in finding that the probative value of evidence 
that Tolentino consumed alcohol  substantially outweighed any 
unfair prejudice. See  State v. Eastman, 81  
Hawaiʻi 131, 141, 
913  P.2d 57, 67 (1996).  
Tolentino also contends that the circuit court erred 
in allowing the State to "make the legal conclusion" during 
closing arguments that Tolentino was "drunk" despite 
insufficient evidence . We first note that the circuit court did 
not rule that the State could "make the legal conclusion" that 
Tolentino was drunk. The circuit court ruled that the State 
could argue during its closing argument that Tolentino was drunk 
"[a]s long as the facts support[ed] it."8 We review the circuit 
court's ruling for abuse of discretion. See State v. Nofoa , 
135 Hawai‘i 220, 227 -28, 349 P.3d 327, 334 -35 (2015). 
Closing arguments are not evidence, nor an opportunity 
for counsel to introduce new evidence. State v. McGhee , 
140 Hawaiʻi 113, 119, 398 P.3d 702, 708 (2017). Prosecutors, 
however, are given "wide latitude " during closing arguments "to 
8 We further note that the State's witnesses did not state during 
their testimonies that Tolentino was "drunk" or "legally intoxicated." They 
testified about Tolentino's appearance and behavior, and that Tolentino 
smelled of "consumed alcohol."

draw reasonable inferences from the evidence ." Id. (citations 
omitted). Therefore, the circuit court did not err in ruling 
that the State could argue during its closing argument that 
Tolentino was drunk so long as the facts supported that 
inference.9 
(3) Tolentino appears to contend  that the circuit 
court erred in denying  Tolentino's challenge of Juror Number 32 
for cause. "We review the [circuit] court's decision to pass a 
juror for cause under the abuse of discretion standard." State 
v. Richie, 88 Hawaiʻi 19, 35, 960 P.2d 1227, 1243 (1998) 
(citation omitted).  
"[W]hen a juror is challenged on grounds that [they 
have] formed an opinion and cannot be impartial, the test is 
whether the nature and strength of the opinion are such as in 
law necessarily raise the presumption of partiality." State v. 
Iuli, 101 Hawaiʻi 196, 204, 65 P.3d 143, 151 (2003) (cleaned up). 
However, "a person with preconceived notions about a case [may 
still] serve as a juror if [they] can lay aside [their] 
Moreover, t here was sufficient evidence supporting the State 's 
"reasonable inference" that Tolentino was drunk. The State presented 
testimonial evidence that Tolentino (1) had "red, watery, glassy, and 
bloodshot" eyes, (2) smelled of consumed alcohol, and (3) "stumbled" and 
moved in a non -linear manner during the incident . See State v. McQueen , 
No. CAAP-20-0000496, 2022 WL 4483362, at *7 -8 (Haw. App. Sept . 27, 2022) 
(mem. op.) (holding that, in closing argument, "characterizing [the 
defendant] as 'a drunk' and 'that drunk person' was a reasonable inference 
within the wide latitude afforded to prosecutors" where evidence was adduced 
of the defendant stumbling, mumbling, slurring, and smelling of alcohol).

impression or opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence 
presented in court." Id. (cleaned up). 
Here, Tolentino challenged Juror Number 32 for cause 
after Juror Number 32 disclosed that he had a friend who was a 
law enforcement officer , and because, as Tolentino assert s, 
Juror Number 32 did not give an unequivocal answer as to whether 
he could be fair and impartial. The circuit court denied 
Tolentino's challenge because when it asked Juror Number 32 
whether "[a]nything about [his] relationship with [his] friend 
who's a police officer would affect [his] ability to be fair and 
impartial," Juror Number 32 answered "No." Although the court 
is "not bound by a prospective juror's statement that [they] 
will be fair and impartial," none of Juror Number 32's responses 
or comments raised the presumption of partia lity.10 See State v. 
Carroll, 146 Hawaiʻi 138, 151-52, 456 P.3d 502, 515-16 (2020) 
(citation omitted) (holding that the juror's responses raised 
the presumption of partiality where the juror expressed that she 
could not presume the defendant's innocence). Therefore, the 
circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying 
Tolentino's c hallenge of Juror Number 32 for cause. 
10 Moreover, n one of Juror Number 32's responses and comments could 
be construed as Juror Number 32 having serious doubts about his ability to be 
fair and impartial, and thus, Juror Number 32 did not have to "assure the 
[circuit] court that he would base his decision solely upon the evidence, " as 
Tolentino suggests. See Iuli, 101 Hawaiʻi at 205, 65 P.3d at 152 (citations 
omitted) . 
9

Tolentino also contends that the circuit court erred 
in denying Tolentino's request for an additional peremptory 
challenge after he was forced to use his last one on Juror 
Number 32. We review t he circuit court's decision to deny 
Tolentino's request for an additional peremptory challenge for 
abuse of discretion . See State v. Allen , No. 30332, 2013 WL 
5926964, at *9 (Haw. App. Oct. 31, 2013) (mem. op) . 
Although "the denial or impairment of [a defendant's] 
right [to exercise a peremptory challenge] is reversible error 
not requiring a showing of prejudice," the court must first 
determine whether a juror, on whom the defendant was forced to 
use a peremptory challenge, "was improperly passed for cause." 
State v. Kauhi , 86 Hawaiʻi 195, 198, 948 P.2d 1036, 1039 (1997) 
(cleaned up). Because we concluded supra that Juror Number 32 
was not improperly passed for cause, the circuit court, 
accordingly, did not err in denying Tolentino's request for an 
additional peremptory challenge. 
(4) Tolentino next contends that the circuit court 
erred in sustaining his conviction despite insufficient evidence 
of reckless conduct. We review the sufficiency of the evidence 
using the following standard: 
[E]vidence adduced in the trial court must be considered in 
the strongest light for the prosecution when the appellate 
court passes on the legal sufficiency of such evidence to 
support a conviction; the same standard applies whether the 
case was before a judge or jury. The test on appeal is not 
whether guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt, but 
10   
 
 
  
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
whether there was substantial evidence to support the 
conclusion of the trier of fact. 
State v. Kalaola, 124 Hawaiʻi 43, 49, 237 P.3d 1109, 1115 (2010) 
(emphasis added) (citation omitted).   "Substantial evidence as 
to every material element of the offense charged is credible 
evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to 
enable a person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion." 
Id.  (cleaned up).  
HRS § 702-206(3)(a)  (2014) states  that "[a]  person 
acts recklessly with respect to his conduct when he consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that [his] 
conduct is of the specified nature." "[I]t is not necessary for 
the prosecution to introduce direct evidence of a defendant's 
state of mind in order to prove that the defendant acted 
intentionally, knowingly[,]  or recklessly." Eastman, 81 
Hawaiʻi 
at  140-41, 913 P.2d at  66-67 (citation omitted). "[P]roof by 
circumstantial evidence and reasonable inferences arising from 
circumstances surrounding the defendant's conduct is 
sufficient." Id.  at 141, 913 P.2d at 67 (citation omitted).  
Here, Corporal Dannan Smith , one of the responding 
officers, testified to "see[ing] [Tolentino] swing at Officer 
Fontes with a closed fist," which he perceived as "a deliberate 
swing." Officer Fontes also testified that, as he was trying to 
detain Tolentino, T olentino kick ed, pushed, and punch ed him. 
11   
 
 
  
  
  
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Construing the evidence in the strongest light for the 
prosecution, t here is substantial evidence for a jury to 
conclude that Tolentino "consciously disregarded a substantial 
and unjustifiable risk " that his actions would result in bodily 
injury to Officer Fontes . See id. (holding that slapping 
someone on the side of the head involves a substantial and 
unjustifiable risk). We therefore conclude that there was 
substantial evidence to support the jury's verdict. 
(5)  Tolentino contends that defense  counsel  was 
ineffective  for failing to move for a judgment of acquittal 
after the jury was discharged. To establish a  claim of 
ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant must show: "1) 
that there were specific errors or omissions reflecting 
counsel's lack of skill, judgment, or diligence; and 2) that 
such errors or omissions resulted in either the withdrawal or 
substantial impairment of a potentially meritorious defense."   
State v. DeLeon, 131 Hawaiʻi 463, 478-79, 319 P.3d 382, 397-98 
(2014) (citation omitted).  
In light of our ruling in section (4) supra, we 
conclude that defense counsel's decision not to move for 
judgment of acquittal after the jury was discharged "did not 
rise to an error that resulted in either the withdrawal or 
substantial impairment of a potentially meritorious defense."
