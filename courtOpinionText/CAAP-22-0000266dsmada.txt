ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and Chan, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of Plaintiff-Appellee Bank of New 
York Mellon FKA the Bank of New York, as Trustee (CWALT 
2006-32CB)'s motion to dismiss the appeal (
Motion), filed 
October 21, 2022, the papers in support and in opposition, and the record, it appears that we lack subject matter jurisdiction over Defendants-Appellants Dennis Duane Deshaw and Susan Kay Broer-Deshaw (Deshaws) appeal from the Circuit Court of the First 
Circuit's (Circuit Court) April 12, 2022 Judgment because the 
Deshaws failed to obtain a stay of the April 12, 2022 "Order 
Approving Commissioner's Report and Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Confirmation of Foreclosure Sale, Allowance of Costs, Commissions and Fees, Distribution of Proceeds, Directing Conveyance and for Writ of Possession/Ejectments [sic], Filed January 26, 2022," and the foreclosed property was sold to a bona NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
fide purchaser. See Bank of New York Mellon v. R. Onaga, Inc., 
140 Hawai# i 358, 370, 400 P.3d 559, 570 (2017) ("[I]f a stay is 
not obtained and the property is sold to a bona fide purchaser, 
the appeal should be dismissed as moot because no effective relief can be granted."); Hamilton ex rel. Lethem v. Lethem, 119 Hawai# i 1, 4, 193 P.3d 839, 842 (2008) ("It is axiomatic that 
mootness is an issue of subject matter jurisdiction."). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is 
granted and the appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, November 4, 2022.
