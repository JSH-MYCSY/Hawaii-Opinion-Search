STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v. 
ALANA WILLIAMS, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
WAILUKU DIVISION 
(CASE NO. 2DTA-21-00989) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: 
Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Alana 
Williams appeals from the 
"Judgment and Notice of Entry of Judgment" entered by the 
District Court of the Second Circuit, Wailuku Division, on 
March 18, 2022.1 For the reasons explained below, we affirm. 
The facts relevant to this appeal are undisputed. On 
October 29, 2021, Williams was arrested in a parking lot in Kîhei, Maui, Hawai# i for operating a vehicle under the influence 
of an intoxicant. 
On November 18, 2021, Williams was charged by 
complaint with one count of Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII) in violation of Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1) and/or (3) and subject to HRS 
§ 291E-61(b)(1) and (b)(4). The complaint was signed by a deputy

prosecuting attorney (DPA). Williams pleaded not guilty on 
November 30, 2021. 
A pretrial conference was held on December 17, 2021. 
The State orally moved to amend the complaint. The motion was 
granted over Williams' objection. On December 27, 2021, Williams filed a motion to dismiss for failure to comply with HRS § 805-1. An amended complaint was filed on December 28, 2021. It contained a declaration by the DPA. Williams' motion to dismiss was heard on January 20, 2022. The motion was denied. The district court entered "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying Motion to Dismiss" on January 31, 2022.

A bench trial was conducted on March 18, 2022. 
Williams was found guilty as charged. The Judgment was entered on March 18, 2022. This appeal followed. 
Williams contends that the district court erred by 
denying her motion to dismiss the complaint and amended complaint. She relies on State v. Thompson, 150 Hawai# i 262, 
266, 500 P.3d 447, 451 (2021). 
In Thompson
, the supreme court 
held that HRS § 805-1 required that a criminal complaint be "subscribed by the complainant under oath . . . or . . . by declaration in accordance with the rules of court." Id. at 267, 
500 P.3d at 452. But the supreme court later restricted its holding in Thompson, and held that HRS § 805-1 applies only to criminal complaints used to obtain a penal summons or arrest warrant. State v. Mortensen-Young, 152 Hawai# i 385, 399, 526 
P.3d 362, 376 (2023).
3 "[T]he requirements of HRS § 805-1 do not 
apply to complaints used to charge a defendant who has already been arrested." Id. at 397, 526 P.3d at 374. 
Williams was arrested for OVUII and then charged by 
complaint. Thus, Hawai# i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) 
Rule 7(d) applies. Mortensen-Young, 152 Hawai# i at 399, 526 P.3d

completed.

at 376. HRPP Rule 7(d) requires that a complaint be signed by 
the prosecutor. The complaint in this case was, as were the complaints at issue in Mortensen-Young, in compliance with HRPP Rule 7(d). The district court did not err by denying Williams' motion to dismiss. Williams asserts no other points of error. 
For the foregoing reasons, the "Judgment and Notice of 
Entry of Judgment" entered by the district court on March 18, 2022, is affirmed.
