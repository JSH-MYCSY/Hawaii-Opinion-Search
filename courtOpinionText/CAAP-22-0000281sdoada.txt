 the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), pursuant to Hawaii 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1) (2020).   In the Licensing 
Case, the district court convicted Dellacqua of (1) Licensing, pursuant to HRS § 286-102 (2020);  (2) Driving While License 
Suspended or Revoked, pursuant to HRS § 286-132 (2020);  and 
(3) Operating a Vehicle After License and Privilege Have Been 
Suspended or Revoked for OVUII, pursuant to HRS § 291E-62 (2020)  
(collectively, Licensing Offenses).

2  HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) provides: 
 
(a) A person commits t he offense of operating a vehicle 
under the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates 
or assumes actual physical control of the vehicle: 
 
(1) While under the influence of alcohol in an amount sufficient to impair the person's normal 
mental faculties or ability to care for the 
person and guard against casualty[.] 
 
3  HRS § 286-102(a) provides in relevant part that "[n]o person . . . 
shall operate any category of motor vehicles listed in this section without 
first being appropriately examined and duly licensed as a qualified driver of 
that category of motor vehicles."   
 
4  HRS § 286- 132 provides: 
 
Except as provided in section 291E- 62, no resident or 
nonresident whose driver's license, right, or privilege to operate a motor vehicle in this State has been canceled, suspended, or revoked may drive any motor vehicle upon the 
highways of this State while the license, right, or 
privilege remains canceled, suspended, or revoked. 
 
5  HRS § 291E-62(a) provides in relevant part that "[n]o person whose 
license and privilege to operate a vehicle have been revoked, suspended, or 
otherwise restricted pursuant to this section . . . shall operate or assume 
actual physical control of any vehicle . . . [w]hile the person's license or 
privilege to operate a vehicle remains suspended or revoked[.]" 
 
6  The district court also convicted Dellacqua of Conditions of 
Operation and Registration of Motor Vehicles, under HRS § 431:10C- 104(a) 
(2019), requiring motor vehicle insurance.  Dellacqua does not challenge this 
conviction. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

   On appeal, Dellacqua contends the district court 
plainly erred by (1) convicting him of all three Licensing 
Offenses as these offenses merged, and (2) permitting Maui 
Police Department (MPD) Officer Jun Hattori (Officer Hattori) to 
testify as an expert, without which there would be insufficient 
evidence to convict him of OVUII.  Dellacqua requests that we 
vacate two of the licensing convictions in the Licensing Case 
and reverse the OVUII conviction in the OVUII Case. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the issues raised and the arguments advanced by the parties, we 
resolve Dellacqua's points of error as discussed below, and 
affirm in part and vacate in part. 
(1) The district court plainly erred by convicting 
Dellacqua of all three Licensing Offenses.  
Though Dellacqua did not challenge his convictions for 
all three Licensing Offenses below, where there is a reasonable possibility Dellacqua was convicted of all three Licensing 
Offenses based on the "same conduct" under HRS § 701-109(1)(e) 
(2014), plain error review is appropriate.  See State v. 
Frisbee, 114 Hawai‘ i 76, 84, 156 P.3d 1182, 1190 (2007) 
(recognizing plain error occurred where trial court's omission of jury instruction on merger "contravened HRS § 701-109(1)(e) 
and was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt").   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 HRS § 701-109(1)(e) provides: 
When the same conduct of a defendant may establish an 
element of more than one offense, the defendant may be 
prosecuted for each offense of which such conduct is an 
element.  The defendant may not, however, be convicted of 
more than one offense if: 
 
. . . . 
 
(e)  The offense is defined as a continuing course 
of conduct and the defendant's course of 
conduct was uninterrupted, unless the law 
provides that specific periods of conduct constitute separate offenses.
 
 
(Emphases added.)  Here, the conduct of all three Licensing 
Offenses was driving or operating a vehicle.  See HRS §§ 286-
102, 286-132, 291E-62.  We must then consider whether this conduct (driving or operating a vehicle) was continuous and 
uninterrupted.  See HRS § 701-109(1)(e). 
MPD Officer Zachary Kamaka (Officer Kamaka) testified 
that, on April 5, 2021, he observed Dellacqua turning right from Central Avenue to Main Street, without using a turn signal.  
Officer Kamaka then followed Dellacqua, and observed him turning 
left from Main Street to Church Street, again without using a 
turn signal.  At that point, Officer Kamaka stopped Dellacqua. 
Based on Officer Kamaka's testimony, Dellacqua's 
conduct of driving the car was continuous until Officer Kamaka 
229, 251 (2019) (setting forth the test for continuous course of 
conduct).  There was no evidence presented to show that 
Dellacqua's driving was interrupted or that Dellacqua had stopped him.  See State v. Lavoie, 145
 Hawai‘i 409, 431, 453 P.3d NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

   separate and distinct intentions to commit three separate 
Licensing Offenses.  State v. Matias, 102 Hawai‘ i 300, 305, 75 
P.3d 1191, 1196 (2003) ("Where there is one intention, one 
general impulse, and one plan, there is but one offense.") (citation omitted).  
Moreover, the plain language of the charged Licensing 
Offenses do not "provide[] that specific periods of conduct 
constitute separate offenses."  HRS § 701-109(1)(e).  Although 
it was permissible to charge Dellacqua with the Licensing 
Offenses, it was not permissible to convict him of more than one 
offense if "[t]he offense [was] defined as a continuing course of conduct and the defendant's course of conduct was 
uninterrupted."  See HRS § 701-109(1)(e). 
(2) Dellacqua's challenge to the admission of 
evidence was waived. 
As Dellacqua acknowledges, he did not object to 
Officer Hattori's testimony and, thus, waived this point of 
error.  See HRS § 641-16 (2016) ("[e]xcept as otherwise provided 
by the rules of court, there shall be no reversal for any alleged error in the admission or rejection of evidence . . . unless such alleged error was made the subject of an objection 
noted at the time it was committed or brought to the attention  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

   of the court in another appropriate manner"); Hawai‘ i Rules of 
Evidence Rule 103 ("[e]rror may not be predicated upon a ruling 
which admits or excludes evidence unless a substantial right of 
the party is affected, and . . . a timely objection or motion to strike appears of record, stating the specific ground of 
objection"); State v. Boyer, 153 Hawai
‘i 238, 530 P.3d 430, 
No. CAAP-21-0000333, 2023 WL 3916181 at *8 (App. June 9, 2023) 
(SDO) (holding that challenge to testimony regarding HGN test 
was waived where defendant did not object).  
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the district court's 
April 8, 2022 judgment and notice of entry of judgment entered 
in the OVUII Case.  We vacate the district court's April 8, 2022 
judgment and notice of entry of judgment entered in the 
Licensing Case, and remand the Licensing Case to the district court for the State to elect whether (1) it will dismiss two of 
the licensing convictions, or (2) retry Dellacqua.  See State v. 
Padilla, 114 Hawai‘ i 507, 517-18, 164 P.3d 765, 775-76 
(App. 2007). 
If the State chooses to dismiss two of the licensing 
convictions, the district court shall enter an Amended Judgment that reinstates the non-dismissed licensing conviction, as well 
as the unchallenged Conditions of Operation and Registration of NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 Motor Vehicles conviction, and reflects the dismissal with 
prejudice of two of the licensing convictions.
