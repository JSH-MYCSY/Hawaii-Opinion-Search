ORDER

  Upon consideration of 
self-represented Claimant-
Appellant-Appellant Regina A. Coda's (Coda) " Judgment on Appeal" 
filed on July 13, 2023, which we construe as a motion for 
reconsideration, it appears that the motion is unauthorized as 
untimely.  See Hawaii ‘ Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 40(a) 
("A motion for reconsideration may be filed by a party only 
within 10 days after the filing of the . . . dispositional order NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʿI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
2  
 . . . .").  The Summary Disposition Order in this appeal was 
filed June 23, 2023. 
Therefore, IT IS ORDERED that the Motion for 
Reconsideration is denied. 
  DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai‘ i, July 20, 2023.
