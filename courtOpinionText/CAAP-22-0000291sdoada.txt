Recusal in Want of Subject Matter Jurisdiction and 42 USC 1983 
Civil Rights Violations Includes Due Process, Filed April 6, 
2022." 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
the issues raised and arguments advanced, we resolve this appeal 
as follows: 
(1) We first address BONYM's contention that the 
circuit court erred in dismissing BONYM's complaint without 
prejudice for lack of standing. 3 
The record reflects that Colton filed "motions to 
dismiss," on January 11, 2022 and January 12, 2022. 4 The circuit 
court, in ruling on these motions to dismiss, considered matters 
outside of the pleadings. The Dismissal Order observed that 
BONYM's counsel "represented to the [circuit c]ourt on the 
record that [BONYM] was still in the process of obtaining a 
3 We note that the circuit court erred in initially determining 
that standing is an issue of subject matter jurisdiction. "In Hawaiʻi state 
courts, standing is a prudential consideration regarding the proper - and 
properly limited – role of courts in a democratic society and is not an issue 
of subject matter jurisdiction, as it is in federal courts." Tax Found. of 
Haw. v. State, 144 Hawaiʻi 175, 188, 439 P.3d 127, 140 (2019) (quotation marks 
omitted). The circuit court later acknowledged and corrected its error in 
its Reconsideration Order. 
4 Colton's motions to dismiss did not expressly state whether 
Colton was relying on Hawaiʻi Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rules 12(b)(1), 
12(b)(6), 56, or some other procedural rule. In the January 11, 2022 motion, 
Colton stated "[i]f a complaint meets the requirements of HRCP Rule 8(a), 
dismissal pursuant to HRCP Rule 12(b)(6) is appropriate where the allegations 
of the complaint itself clearly demonstrate that plaintiff does not have a 
claim," indicating Colton was relying on HRCP Rule 12(b)(6), which involves 
dismissal based only on the pleadings. (Cleaned up.)

declaration regarding the location of the original note." The 
Dismissal Order also stated that the circuit court had 
considered BONYM's submission of a bailee letter and a copy of 
the original Note, along with late-filed errata consisting of 
the declaration of Jeane Hirao. Under HRCP Rule 12(b), when a 
court considers matters outside the pleadings in a motion 
brought under Rule 12(b)(6), "the motion shall be treated as one 
for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56." 
Colton was therefore required to meet the burden of proof 
applying to a motion for summary judgment. See Andrade v. Cnty. 
of Hawaiʻi, 145 Hawaiʻi 265, 268-70, 451 P.3d 1, 4-6 (App. 2019). 
The Note submitted by BONYM in opposition to Colton's 
motions to dismiss was indorsed in blank by Michele Sjolander on 
behalf of Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. To enforce a promissory 
note indorsed in blank, the foreclosing lender must prove 
standing by demonstrating it had possession of the note when 
filing the lawsuit. Bank of Am., N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 
139 Hawaiʻi 361, 368-69, 390 P.3d, 1248, 1255-56 (2017). "A 
foreclosing plaintiff's burden to prove entitlement to enforce 
the note overlaps with the requirements of standing in 
foreclosure actions as '[s]tanding is concerned with whether the 
parties have the right to bring suit.'" Id. at 367, 390 P.3d at 
1254 (citation omitted); see also U.S. Bank Trust, N.A. v. 
Verhagen, 149 Hawaiʻi 315, 327, 489 P.3d 419, 431 (2021).

To obtain summary judgment based on BONYM's alleged 
lack of standing, Colton needed to either:  (1) present evidence 
negating BONYM's possession of the Note when initiating the 
suit;  or (2) demonstrate that BONYM would be unable to prove 
such possession at trial.  See  Ralston  v. Yim, 129 Hawaiʻi 46,  
60, 292 P.3d 1276,  1290  (2013). In this case, Colton's motions 
did not present evidence negating BONYM's possession of the Note  
at the time BONYM  filed the complaint.  
Accordingly, Colton could only succeed under the 
second Ralston prong, by showing that at trial BONYM would be 
unable to prove it possessed the Note when it filed the 
complaint. See id. However, because the circuit court had not 
yet set a discovery deadline when it issued the March 17, 2022 
Dismissal Order, Colton could not obtain summary judgment by 
merely pointing to BONYM's failure to present evidence of 
standing. 
[I]n  general, a summary judgment movant cannot merely point 
to the non-moving party's lack of evidence to support its 
initial burden of production if discovery has not 
concluded. . . .  "[M]erely asserting that the non-moving 
party has not come forward with evidence to support its 
claims is not enough."  
Id.  at 61, 292 P.3d at 1291  (emphasis added)  (citation omitted). 
The circuit court  therefore erred in dismissing BONYM's 
complaint "[b]ased on [BONYM's] failure to meet its burden" of 
proving standing. It  was Colton who failed to meet her burden 
of proving that BONYM would be unable to establish standing at

trial. See Mobley v. Kimura, 146 Hawaiʻi 311, 326, 463 P.3d 968, 
983 (2020) (holding that the defendant did not meet their burden 
of proving the plaintiff did not satisfy the tort threshold 
exception under Hawaiʻi's no-fault statute, where the defendant 
did not present evidence negating the exception, and discovery 
had not yet concluded). 
For the above reasons, we conclude that the circuit 
court erred in dismissing BONYM's complaint for lack of 
standing. We therefore vacate the circuit court's Dismissal 
Order, and remand for further proceedings. In light of this 
determination, we decline to address BONYM's remaining points of 
error. 
(2) We next turn to Colton's points of error on 
appeal, which we address in turn as follows5: 
Colton's first point of error appears to allege the 
circuit court erred in granting BONYM four extensions of time to 
file its pretrial statement. B ONYM's last three requests for an 
extension were based on its allegation that it was complying 
with the federal COVID-19 moratorium on foreclosure proceedings. 
The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in granting BONYM 
multiple extensions of time on the basis of that moratorium. 
5 We address Colton's points of error to the extent they are 
discernible, and have numbered them for ease of reference. 
6  
 
 
 
 
 
   
   
 
 
  
 
 
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Colton's second point of error appears to contend that 
the circuit court erred in granting dismissal of BONYM's 
complaint without prejudice, rather than with prejudice. 
Because we find the circuit court erred in dismissing BONYM's 
complaint, this argument necessarily fails. 
Colton's third  point of error alleges "Judge DeWeese 
did not follow the higher courts instructions on remand" and 
"directly defied two higher courts orders." Colton's contention 
lacks merit because the ICA's decisions in Bank of New York 
Mellon  v. Colton, No. CAAP-14-0000984, 2017 WL 3587949  (Haw. 
App. Aug. 21, 2017)  (SDO), and Bank of New York Mellon  v. Colton  
(Colton II), 146 
Hawaiʻi 577,  463 P.3d 1234  (App. 2020), did not 
set forth specific remand instructions.  
Colton's fourth point of error appears to challenge 
the circuit court's June 13, 2022 order denying her motion to 
recuse Judge DeWeese. Colton contends that Judge DeWeese should 
have been recused because she erred in entertaining BONYM's 
motions and submissions after the March 17, 2022 Dismissal 
Order. The record reflects that, after March 17, 2022, the 
circuit court considered BONYM's motions and submissions 
relating to BONYM's motion for reconsideration of the Dismissal 
Order, and BONYM's responses to Colton's motions. Colton 
appears to claim without citing to any supporting legal 
7  
 
 
  
   
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
authority that, after dismissal, BONYM could not file a motion 
for reconsideration or challenge Colton's motions. 
Colton's motion for recusal further argued that Judge 
DeWeese had "a financial interest in conflict with [Colton's] 
rights to justice and an unbiased tribunal," and submitted as an 
attachment the Employees' Retirement System of the State of 
Hawaii's (ERS) "Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for the 
Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2019" that listed BONYM as a service 
provider to the ERS. 
Hawaiʻi courts apply a two-part analysis in judicial 
disqualification or recusal cases. State v. Ross, 89 Hawaiʻi 
371, 377, 974 P.2d 11, 17 (1998). First, the court must apply 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 601-7 (2016) to determine 
whether the alleged bias is covered by a statutory prohibition. 
Id. If the alleged bias falls outside of HRS § 601-7, the court 
may then determine, if appropriate, whether the circumstances 
"fairly give rise to an appearance of impropriety and . . . 
reasonably cast suspicion on [the judge's] impartiality." Id. 
(ellipsis and brackets in original) (citation omitted). 
The applicability of the disqualification factors in 
HRS § 601-7(a)(1) (2016) to Judge DeWeese turns on whether she 
had "a more than de minimus pecuniary interest" in the case. 
(Emphasis added.) "The Hawaiʻi Revised Code of Judicial Conduct 
(HRCJC) . . . has defined '[d]e minimus' in the context of 
8  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
interests pertaining to disqualification of a judge, [as 
meaning] an insignificant interest that could not raise a 
reasonable question regarding the judge's impartiality." Title 
Guar.  Escrow Servs. Inc. v. Wailea Resort Co., No. CAAP-12-
0000711, 2016 WL  4555771, at *5 (Haw. App. Aug. 31, 2016)  (mem. 
op.). Colton presented no evidence that BONYM's success in the 
foreclosure proceeding would have any impact on the ERS, or on 
Judge DeWeese's retirement benefits. Thus,  the circuit court 
did not abuse its discretion in denying Colton's recusal motion.  
Colton's fifth point of error contends the circuit 
court erred by failing to dismiss BONYM's complaint pursuant to 
HRS § 604-5(d) (2016). HRS § 604-5(d), which prohibits the 
district courts from hearing real actions, or actions involving 
title to real estate, does not apply to the circuit courts. 
Colton's sixth point of error appears to be two-fold. 
First, Colton contends the circuit court erred in issuing orders 
and entertaining motions, after she filed her first notice of 
appeal on July 18, 2014, because the "July 18, 2014 [Notice of 
Appeal] filed by Colton removed the [circuit court's] 
jurisdiction." Second, Colton contends that the circuit court 
was "without jurisdiction from 2014 to 2022" based on the 
circuit court's finding that BONYM lacked standing. 
We note first that the ICA's decision in Colton II, 
which vacated the circuit court's August 1, 2016 sanctions order 
9  
 
 
 
 
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and the February 10, 2017 HRCP Rule 54(b) judgment, had already 
remedied the circuit court's  erroneous rulings after her July 
2014 appeal. Moreover, pursuant to section (1), supra, Colton's 
second contention  lacks merit.  
For the foregoing reasons, we  vacate the circuit 
court's March 17, 2022 Dismissal Order,  June 15, 2022 
Reconsideration Order,  and June 22, 2022 Judgment dismissing 
BONYM's complaint, and remand for further proceedings consistent 
with this summary disposition order.   We affirm all other orders 
appealed from.
