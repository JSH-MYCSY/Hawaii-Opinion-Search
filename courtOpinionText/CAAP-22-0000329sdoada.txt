JONATHAN ELLWAY, Defendant
-Appellant   
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
WAILUKU DIVISION 
(CASE NO. 2DTA-21-00171) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER    
(By: Wadsworth, Presiding Judge, McCullen and Guidry, JJ.)  
 
Defendant-Appellant Jonathan Ellway ( Ellway) appeals 
from the Judgment and Notice of Entry of Judgment ( Judgment ), 
filed on April 1, 2022 by the District Court of the Second 
Circuit (district court ).1 
On March 3, 2021, the State of Hawai ʻi (State ) filed a 
Complaint against Ellway charging him with violating Hawaii 
Revised Statutes ( HRS
) § 291E-61(a)(1), and/or 291E-61(a)(3) 
(2020) for operating a vehicle under the influence of an

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
intoxicant. The district court held a bench trial,   and Ellway 
was found guilty   under HRS   §   291E-61(a)(3).  
Ellway   raises four   points of error   on appeal, 
contending that the district   court erred by: (1) "denying 
[Ellway's]   oral motion . . . to dismiss the Complaint as being 
defective under State v. Thompson,   150 Hawai ʻi 262, 500 P.3d 447 
(2021)";   (2) "completing Ellway's trial"   with a substitute   judge 
"without obtaining Ellway's knowing, intelligent and voluntary 
consent through an on-the-record colloquy";   (3)   "reviewing the 
video of Ellway's   trial [proceedings   that were presided over by 
the original judge]   in [Ellway's]   absence   in violation of 
[Ellway's] right to a public trial";   and   (4) "admitting the 
results of [Ellway's]   breath test because [the]   State's 
[e]xhibits   . . .   lacked sufficient foundation."   
Upon careful review of the record, briefs,   and 
relevant legal authorities, and having given due consideration 
to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties,   
we resolve   Ellway's   points of error as follows:   
(1) Ellway contends that the district court erred when 
it denied Ellway's motion to dismiss the complaint as defective. 
We review the trial court's ruling on a motion to dismiss a 
charge for abuse of discretion. Thompson, 150 Hawaiʻ i at 266, 
500 P.3d at 451.     
2   
 
  
   
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Ellway's motion to dismiss was made during trial.  
Hawaiʻi Rules of Penal Procedure ( HRPP) Rule 12(b) states, in 
relevant part:   
(b) Pretrial motions. . . . The following must be 
raised prior to trial:   
(1) defenses and objections based on defects in the 
institution of the prosecution;   
(2) defenses and objections based on defects in the 
charge ( other than that it fails to show jurisdiction in 
the court   or to charge an offense which   objections shall be 
noticed by the court at any time during the pendency of the 
proceedings )[.]   
(Emphasis added.)   
Ellway contends   that the motion to dismiss was timely   
under HRPP Rule 12(b)   because it alleged that the district court 
lacked jurisdiction over the matter, due to the State's failure   
to comply with the complaint requirements under HRS § 805-1 
(2014), and jurisdiction is a defense that may be noticed by the 
court at any time during the pendency of the proceeding.    
The Hawai ʻi Supreme Court in State v. Mortensen-Young   
clarified "that HRS § 805-1   applies only to complaints for a 
penal summons or an arrest warrant." 152 Hawaiʻ i 385, 387, 526 
P.3d 362, 364 (2023). Here, the   Complaint was not for   a penal 
summons or an arrest warrant. See   id.   at   395, 526 P.3d at 372. 
HRS § 805-1 is inapplicable here.  We conclude, therefore, that 
the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying 
Ellway's motion to dismiss.   
3   
 
(2) Ellway contends that the substitution of a new 
judge, midway through   Ellway's trial, implicated his fundamental 
constitutional rights. And because the district court proceeded 
without   engaging in an on-the-record colloquy and "obtaining 
Ellway's knowing, intelligent and voluntary   [waiver],"   the 
district court committed reversible error.    See   State v. Chang, 
144 Hawaiʻi 535, 545, 445 P.3d 116, 126 (2019) ("[T]rial courts 
must engage in an on-the-record colloquy with a defendant   . . .   
to   ensure that any waiver of [fundamental constitutional] rights 
is knowing, intelligent,   and voluntary.")   (citation omitted);   
State v. Sprattling, 99 Hawaiʻ i 312, 321, 55 P.3d 276, 285 (2002) 
("Failure to obtain a valid waiver constitutes reversible 
error.")   (citation omitted).    We review questions of 
constitutional law de novo under the right/wrong standard. 
State v. Fields, 115 Hawai ʻi 503, 511, 168 P.3d 955, 963 (2007).   
   
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"[W]here a waiver goes beyond the bounds of trial 
tactics and procedure, and impinges significantly on [a] 
constitutionally guaranteed right,"   waiver   must be done by the 
beneficiary of the right, not by counsel. State v. Casey, 
51   Haw. 99, 101, 451 P.2d 806, 808-09 (1969). "A fundamental 
constitutional right is one that is explicitly or implicitly 
guaranteed by the Constitution." In re Applications of Herrick,
82 Hawaiʻ i 329, 345, 922 P.2d 942, 958 (1996) (cleaned up).  
Ellway does not cite to legal authority recognizing the  
4   
 
fundamental right to a particular judge or factfinder, and we 
are unaware of such authority.     
   
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Moreover, the record reflects that the substitution of 
the   judge during the bench trial –   to which Ellway consented –   
did not infringe upon his constitutionally guaranteed   rights.    
Instructive here is this court's previous conclusion that a 
judge could   be substituted during a criminal defendant's   bench   
trial   where, as here,   the defendant failed to object to the 
substitution of the   new judge, the record reflects that the 
substitute judge "watched the official videotape of the previous 
witnesses' testimony and was completely familiar with the record 
of the trial," and the defendant "failed to [otherwise]   
demonstrate any prejudice to his rights under the unique facts 
of [the] case."    State v. Fleming, No. CAAP-15-0000772, 2019 WL 
5418065, at *4–5   (Haw. App. Oct. 22, 2019) (SDO).  
Here, the substitute judge   represented to the parties 
that   he "reviewed all of the records and files in [the] case, 
including reviewing the entire videotape proceedings of the 
trial." Ellway's counsel   represented on the record that she had 
spoken   with Ellway about the substitution of a new judge to 
preside over the case,   and that she and Ellway   had "no objection 
to [the substitute judge] presiding and continuing [the] trial."  
Ellway does not demonstrate how he was prejudiced by   the 
substitution of a new judge.   
5   
 
We conclude, therefore, that the district court was 
not wrong in continuing the trial with a substitute judge, and 
in doing so   without conducting an on-the-record colloquy.   
   
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(3) Ellway contends that the district court   violated 
his "right to a public trial" when the substitute judge reviewed 
the video of Ellway's prior trial proceedings in his absence.    
We review questions of constitutional law de novo under the 
right/wrong standard. Fields, 115 Hawai ʻi at   511, 168 P.3d at   
963.    
The Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution states 
that "[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy 
the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been 
committed." U.S. Const. amend. VI. The public trial right 
applies to most   stages of a trial. Weaver v. Massachusetts, 582 
U.S. 286, 292 (2017). Article I, section 14 of the Constitution 
of the State of Hawai ‛i provides an analogous right to a public 
trial.   
The substitute judge   did not "close" the proceedings   
to the public; he reviewed the video recordings of the part of 
the bench trial over which another judge had presided.    There is 
no evidence in the record to suggest that the district court, while reviewing the video recordings, conducted further 
proceedings that should have been public.     
6   
 
We conclude, therefore, that the district court did 
not err when it reviewed Ellway's prior trial proceedings,   and 
it did not violate Ellway's right to a public trial.   
  
 
To be admissible   under HRE Rule 803(b)(6), the party 
seeking to introduce the evidence   must establish foundation   
   
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(4) Ellway contends that the district court "committed 
reversible   error" by   admitting into evidence, without sufficient 
foundation,   the State's   Certificates of Analysis   (State Exhibits 
3 and 4)  under the business records   hearsay exception.    "[W]here 
the admissibility of evidence is determined by application of 
the hearsay rule, there can be only one correct result, and the 
appropriate standard for appellate review is the right/wrong 
standard." State v. Moore, 82 2
Hawaiʻi
 202, 217, 921 P.2d 122, 
137 (1996) (cleaned up).   
Hawaii Rules of Evidence ( HRE)   Rule 803(b)(6) provides 
that the following category, inter alia,   is excluded from the 
hearsay rule:   
Records of regularly conducted activity . A memorandum 
report, record, or data compilation, in any form, of acts, 
events, conditions, opinions, or diagnoses, made in the course of a regularly conducted activity, at or near the 
time of the acts, events, conditions, opinions, or 
diagnoses.   
(Emphasis added.)   
2   The record reflects that Maui Police Department ( MPD) receives a 
certification of analysis when it orders reference samples for its breath 
alcohol testing instruments. The reference samples are used to test the 
accuracy of the breath alcohol testing instrument s.   
7   
 
through the "testimony of the custodian or other qualified 
witness, or by certification that complies with rule 902(11) or 
a statute permitting certification." Qualified witnesses do not 
need to be employees of the business that created the document, 
nor do they need to have "direct, personal knowledge of how the 
document was created."    State v. Fitzwater, 122 Hawaiʻi 354, 366, 
227 P.3d 520, 532   (2010).    "[E]mployee[s]   of a business that 
receive[]   records from another business can be . . . qualified 
witness[es]" if   they "have enough familiarity with the record-
keeping system of the business in question to explain how the 
record came into existence in the ordinary course of business,"   
and the records "were created in the regular course of some 
entity's business."    Id.   (citation omitted).

However, the witness must not only show that the 
organization relied on the records created by another 
entity, there must also be   other indicia of reliability 
such as   having a contractual obligation to create the 
records. Id.   at 366–69, 227 P.3d at 532–35.   
Sergeant Nicholas Krau's testimony during the trial 
demonstrated   that: (1) MPD regularly orders the   breath alcohol 
test   reference samples, which come with the Certificates of 
Analysis; (2) MPD relies on the accuracy of the contents of 
these certificates; (3) MPD has a contractual relationship with 
the vendors   who make these certificates; and (4) the Department 
8   
 
  
 
 
 
 
   
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of Health (DOH)   has approved the vendors of these certificates. 
Therefore, MPD provided sufficient indicia of reliability as to 
the Certificates of Analysis, and the district court did not err 
in admitting them into evidence.     3
For the foregoing reasons, we   affirm the Judgment

3   We note that State Exhibits 3 and 4 would have also been 
admissible because MPD had approval from the DOH DUI Coordinator.    State v. 
Werle, 121 
Hawaiʻi 274, 282-8 3, 218 P.3d 762, 770-71   (2009) (holding that in 
lieu of expert testimony, the proponent of the evidence may show that the DUI 
coordinator approved the specific testing procedure and instrument as a 
"shortcut" to establishing reliability).
