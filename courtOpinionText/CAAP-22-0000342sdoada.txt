 of an Intoxicant (
OVLPSR-OVUII), in violation of Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS) § 291E-62(a).  
  On appeal, Primo raises a single point of error, 
contending that the District Court "erred in denying Primo's motion to dismiss Count 5 of the State's Second Amended Complaint," and with respect to the FOFs/COLs, specifically challenges FOF 2
2 and COLs 1, 1(a), 1(c), 1(f), the last sentence 
of 1(g), 1(h), 2, 2(a), the second sentence of 2(b), and the second to the last and last sentences of 2(f).

2  While Primo includes a challenge to FOF 2 within the point, Primo 
presents no argument in support.  See Hawai‘i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
Rule 28(b)(7) (requiring argument on the points presented).  The challenge to 
FOF 2 is waived.  See id. ("Points not argued may be deemed waived.").

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 
 
      1. The requirements of Hawai‘ i revised [sic] Statute [sic] 
("HRS")
 § 805-1 and Thompson do not apply where the State did not 
seek an arrest warrant or penal summons contemporaneously with the filing of the Complaint. 
 
a. HRS § 805- 1 is concerned with cases where the 
prosecution seeks an arrest warrant or penal summons 
contemporaneously with the filing of a complaint. Stated 
differently, the requirements of the statute do not apply where 
the defendant is already in custody or has posted bail/bond when 
a complaint is filed against them. 
 
. . . . 
 
c. Although HRS § 805 -1 provides requirements for the 
filing of a complaint, it also requires the issuance of an
 arrest 
warrant upon presentation of the complaint. Simply, it would be 
inapposite for a court to issue an arrest warrant for a defendant 
who is already in custody by virtue of a previously issued arrest 
warrant or a warrantless arrest. To potentially subject a 
defendant to two warrants of arrest – and potentially two bail 
amounts - or issue a warrant to a defendant who is already in 
custody cannot be within the contemplation of the statute. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST 'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

   Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve Primo's point of error as follows, and affirm. 
 
f. HRS § 805- 1 is only concerned with cases where the 
prosecution seeks an arrest warrant or penal summons 
concomitantly with the filing of a complaint. Its requirements do not apply to the instant case, where the prosecution did not seek 
an arrest warrant or penal summons along with the filing of the 
complaint. 
 
g.  . . . [ Thompson] did not hold that the reach of the 
statute extends to cases where a complaint is not used to seek 
either. 
  
h. Accordingly, HRS § 805- 1 and Thompson  do not apply to 
the instant case, where the prosecution did not seek an arrest 
warrant or penal summons contemporaneously with the filing of the 
complaint. 
 
      2. The State's Second Amended Complaint complies with HRS  
§ 805-1. 
 
a.
 Assuming arguendo HRS § 805- 1 applies to the instant 
case, the State's Second Amended Criminal Complaint complies with 
HRS § 805- 1 because it contains a declaration in accordance with 
the Rules of Court. 
 
b.  . . . The second amended complaint in this case 
complies with the requirements of HRS § 805- 1 and Thompson
 
because it contains a declaration in compliance with all applicable rules of court. 
 
. . . . 
 
f.  . . . The rules of court have no other requirements to 
perfect a complaint, nor does Thompson  impose any further 
prerequisites for the filing of a complaint. The amended 
complaint in this case was perfected by a "declaration in 
accordance with the rules of court," exactly as required by HRS  
§ 805-1 and Thompson, when it was signed by the prosecutor 
pursuant to Rule 7(d) and declared under Rule 47(d). Unlike the 
complaint in Thompson, the complaint in this case complies with 
HRS § 805- 1.

   The following background is from the District Court's 
findings and from the record.4  On September 29, 2021, Primo was 
issued a citation for Leaving the Scene of Accident Involving 
Vehicle Damage, Inattention to Driving, Reckless Driving, and Driving Without Valid License, and was ordered to appear in the Wailuku District Court on November 4, 2021.  FOF 1.  On September 30, 2022, the State filed an Amended Complaint.  FOF 
2.  On December 10, 2021, the Hawai‘ i Supreme Court issued State 
v. Thompson, 150 Hawai‘ i 262, 267, 500 P.3d 447, 452 (2021).5  
FOF 6.  On January 21, 2022, Primo filed a Motion to Dismiss, 
arguing that the Amended Complaint was "fatally defective" pursuant to Thompson and HRS § 805-1, which require that the 
complaint "be subscribed under oath by the complainant or made 
by declaration in lieu of an affidavit[.]"  FOF 7.  On February 
9, 2022, the State filed a Second Amended Complaint (SAC), 
adding a declaration pursuant to Hawai‘ i Rules of Penal Procedure 
(HRPP) Rule 47(d) by the prosecutor who authored the SAC, that 
stated:  "I [] declare under penalty of law that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief[.]"  FOF 8. 
 "The State did not seek an arrest warrant or penal 
summons contemporaneously with the filing of the [SAC] or at any time in this case[.]"  FOF 3.    On February 9, 2022, the State filed a Memorandum in 
Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss, in which the State argued 
that the SAC was only required to comply with HRPP Rule 7(d), 
 
 4  "[U]nchallenged findings of fact are binding upon appellate 
courts."  State v. Rodrigues, 145 Hawai‘ i 487, 497, 454 P.3d 428, 438 (2019) 
(citations omitted).  
 
 5  In Thompson, 150 Hawai‘ i at 267- 68, 500 P.3d at 452- 53, the Hawai‘ i 
Supreme Court held that failure to comply with HRS § 805- 1 renders a 
complaint "fatally defective," and that such a complaint cannot be used to 
support the issuance of an arrest warrant or penal summons.

  and that HRS § 805-1 only applies to a complaint requesting a 
penal summons.
  
  At a February 16, 2022 hearing on the Motion to 
Dismiss, the District Court denied the motion.  On February 25, 2022, the District Court filed its FOFs/COLs, in which it concluded in COL 1 that HRS § 805-1 and Thompson were not 
applicable where the State "did not seek an arrest warrant or penal summons[.]"  In COL 2, the District Court concluded that if HRS § 805-1 and Thompson did apply, the SAC complied with the 
statute.    At the April 20, 2022 bench trial, the State's motion 
to dismiss with prejudice all counts except for count 5, OVLPSR-OVUII was granted, and Primo was tried and convicted of OVLPSR-OVUII.  This appeal followed.   
  Primo argues that the District Court erred in denying 
the Motion to Dismiss because the State's SAC was defective under HRS § 805-1,
6 as no witness with direct observations of 
Primo's misconduct executed a "sworn affidavit" or "declaration in lieu of affidavit" that the allegations contained in the SAC were true and correct.  Primo argues that the District Court erred in COL 1 in concluding that the "requirements of HRS § 805-1 do not apply when the State does not seek to obtain an arrest or penal summons[.]"  Primo further argues that the District Court erred in COL 2 in concluding that if HRS § 805-1 
 
6  HRS § 805- 1 (2014) provides: 
 
 §805 -1. Complaint; form of warrant. When a complaint 
is made to any prosecuting officer of the commission of any 
offense, the prosecuting officer shall examine the 
complainant, shall reduce the substance of the complaint to 
writing, and shall cause the complaint to be subscribed by the complainant under oath, which the prosecuting officer 
is hereby authorized to administer, or the complaint shall 
be made by declaration in accordance with the rules of 
court. . . . NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST 'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

  did apply, "the declaration language in the State's [SAC] 
satisfied the requirement of the statute."   Primo's arguments 
are without merit, in light of State v. Mortensen-Young, 152 
Hawai‘i 385, 526 
P.3d 362 (2023).87
 
  Whether a complaint complied with an applicable 
statute and/or rule is a question of law we review de novo.  
Thompson, 150 Hawai‘ i at 266, 500 P.3d at 451.  "A trial court's 
ruling on a motion to dismiss charge is reviewed for an abuse of 
discretion."  Id. at 266-67, 500 P.3d at 451-52 (internal 
citation, brackets, and quotation marks omitted) (quoting State 
v. Hinton, 120 Hawai‘ i 265, 273, 204 P.3d 484, 492 (2009)).  COLs 
are reviewed under the "right/wrong" standard and will not be overturned when supported by the "trial court's [FOFs]" and reflect an "application of the correct rule of law[.]"  
Mortensen-Young, 152 Hawai‘ i at 392, 526 P.3d at 369 (citation 
and internal quotation marks omitted).   
  In Mortensen-Young, the 
Hawai‘i Supreme Court held that 
HRS § 805-1 applies only to criminal complaints used to obtain a 
penal summons or arrest warrant.  Id. at 397, 526 P.3d at 374. 
In other cases, such as the OVUII prosecutions at issue in Mortensen-Young, HRPP Rule 7
9 provides the proper framework to 
 
7  We do not address this argument in light of our disposition.  
 
 8  On May 1, 2023, the State filed a statement of supplemental 
authority, stating that Mortensen- Young, which the supreme court issued on 
March 15, 2023, "clarifies" Primo's single point of error. [JROA dkt. 58 at 
2.]

 analyze the sufficiency of complaints.  Id. at 399, 526 P.3d at 
376.  In Mortensen-Young, the supreme court held that each of 
the appellees was properly charged with the offense of OVUII by a complaint signed by the prosecutor, pursuant to HRPP Rule 7(d), which does not require that a "'charging instrument in a misdemeanor case be signed by anyone other than a prosecutor'" or be "'subscribed under oath or made by declaration in lieu of an affidavit by anyone.'"  Id.  
  Here, as in Mortensen-Young, HRS § 805-1 is 
inapplicable because the SAC was not used to obtain a penal summons or arrest warrant.  The SAC set forth a concise and definite statement of the essential facts, was signed by the prosecutor, and referenced the statute that Primo allegedly violated, as required by HRPP Rule 7(d).  The SAC was sufficient 
to initiate the subject OVLPSR-OVUII prosecution, and Primo's 
contention is without merit.  See id. at 397, 399, 526 P.3d at 
374, 376.  COL 1 was correct, and it is not necessary to address COL 2, which was an alternative conclusion "[a]ssuming arguendo HRS § 805-1 applie[d]."  See id. at 392, 526 P.3d 369.  The 
District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the 
Motion to Dismiss.  See Thompson, 150 Hawai‘ i at 266-67, 500 P.3d 
at 451-52.   
  For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the  (1) February 25, 2022 "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and 
Order Denying [Primo]'s Motion to Dismiss," and (2) April 20, 
 
(d) The charge shall be a plain, 
concise and definite statement of the essential facts 
constituting the offense charged. . . .  A complaint shall 
be signed by the prosecutor. The charge need not contain a formal conclusion or any other matter not necessary to such 
statement. . . .  The charge shall state for each count the 
official or customary citation of the statute, rule, 
regulation or other provision of law which the defendant is 
alleged therein to have violated. . . .
