APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 2CCV-20-000090)  
 
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: 
Wadsworth, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Brett Christiansen appeals from 
the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit's April 19, 2022 
"Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting 
Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment Against All Defendants 
and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure" (
Order) and 
April 19, 2022 Judgment.  1

Christiansen challenges the circuit court's grant of 
summary judgment allowing Plaintiff-Appellee 1 Oak Ventures Step 
Fund LLC to foreclose on a mortgage (
Mortgage) made by original 
lender Argent Mortgage Company.   2
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
2 Christiansen also challenges Finding of Fact (FOF) 13 and Conclusions 
of Law (COL) 4, 5, 7, 8, and 10: 
[FOF] 13. By reason of said default, Plaintiff is 
entitled to foreclose upon the Property in accordance with 
the terms and conditions provided in the Loan Documents.  
 . . . . 
[COL] 4. Plaintiff is the holder of the Note and is 
entitled to enforce the Note. Plaintiff qualifies as the 
Note holder as it has possession of the Note, indorsed in 
blank, converting the Note to a bearer instrument.  
[COL] 5. Plaintiff is currently in rightful 
possession of the indorsed Note and has standing to 
prosecute the instant action.  
 . . . . 
[COL] 7. An assignment of the Note itself operates 
as a matter of law as an assignment of the mortgage and of 
the mortgagee's powers under it. . . .  
[COL] 8. Plaintiff is entitled to enforce the 
Mortgage as the Mortgage follows the Note. . . .  
 . . . . 
[COL] 10. Plaintiff is entitled to the entry of 
summary judgment and an interlocutory decree of foreclosure 
against all Defendants in the foreclosure action, on the 
grounds that no genuine issue of material fact exists, and 
Plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment and an 
interlocutory decree of foreclosure as a matter of law.  
These challenges are  premised on the arguments Christiansen advances  below.   
Thus, for the reasons discussed below, FOF 13  was not clearly erroneous and 
the challenged COL  were not wrong.  
2   
 
 
 
 
 
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve the 
points of error as discussed below and affirm. 
(1) Christiansen contends the circuit court erred in 
granting summary judgment because 1 Oak failed to establish 
standing to foreclose as it had "not shown how and when it 
acquired the mortgage[.]" 
Appellee 1 Oak did not dispute that it lacked a valid 
assignment of the Mortgage. Instead, it claimed standing to 
foreclose based on possession of the Note indorsed in blank. 
When indorsed in blank, a note becomes payable to the 
bearer and may be negotiated by transfer of possession alone. 
Hawai‘i Revised Statutes § 490:3-205(b) (2008).  Appellee 1 Oak 
was not required to show a valid assignment of the Mortgage 
because once it established possession of the Note, the Mortgage 
automatically transferred with the debt it secured. See Bank of
Am., N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai‘i 361, 371 n.17, 390 P.3d 
1248, 1258 n.17 (2017) (recognizing "the security follows the 
debt," but "the debt does not automatically follow the 
security"). 
Appellee 1 Oak was not required to show when it 
acquired the Note because to have standing to foreclose, 1 Oak 
needed to establish possession of the Note at the time of filing 
of the complaint, which it did. See id. at 370–71, 390 P.3d at 
1257–58 (explaining that foreclosing lender who established

NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
possession of blank indorsed Note at time of moving for summary 
judgment but not at time of filing complaint was not entitled to 
summary judgment). Sean M. Lloyd of FCI Lender Services, Inc. 
(FCI), servicer for 1 Oak, attested counsel had possession of 
the Note as of March 31, 2020, the date the complaint was filed, 
and its Bailee Letter showed that counsel's office received the 
original Note sent by FCI on January 7, 2020. Appellee 1 Oak 
attached a copy of the Note and the Bailee Letter to its summary 
judgment motion. 
Because 1 Oak established it had possession of the 
Note at the time the complaint was filed, it had standing to 
foreclose. 
(2) Christiansen also contends the circuit court 
erred in granting summary judgment because the Note and Mortgage 
were inadmissible evidence. 
The original Note and Mortgage are self-authenticating 
documents and not hearsay. See Hawai‘i Rules of Evidence 
Rule 902(2), (9); U.S. Bank Tr., N.A. as Tr. for LSF9 Master 
Participation Tr. v. Verhagen, 149 Hawai‘i 315, 323, 489 P.3d 
419, 427 (2021). Copies of the Note and Mortgage were 
admissible if they were properly authenticated by extrinsic 
evidence. See Verhagen
, 149 Hawai‘i at 325, 489 P.3d at 429.  
Appellee 1 Oak properly authenticated the copies of 
the Note and Mortgage submitted with its motion for summary

judgment. Robin Miller, counsel for 1 Oak, attested a true and 
correct copy of the original Note TMLF Hawaii LLLC possessed was 
attached to the motion for summary judgment.  Miller also 
attested a certified copy of the Mortgage recorded in the Bureau 
of Conveyances of the State of Hawai‘i was attached to the 
motion. In addition, Lloyd attested the copy of the Note 
attached to the motion for summary judgment was a true and 
correct copy of the original Note FCI sent to counsel. 
Christiansen introduced no evidence to suggest the 
copies of the Note and Mortgage submitted with the motion for 
summary judgment were not accurate duplicates of the original 
Note held by counsel and the original Mortgage recorded in the 
Bureau of Conveyances. 
Thus, the copies of the Note and Mortgage were 
admissible as evidence. 
Based on the forgoing, we affirm the circuit court's 
April 19, 2022 Order and Judgment.
