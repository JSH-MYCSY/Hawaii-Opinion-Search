ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Chan, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
appellate jurisdiction over self-represented Defendant-Appellant 
Lani Pacific's (
Lani Pacific) appeal from the Circuit Court of 
the Third Circuit's (Circuit Court) April 22, 2022 "Order Denying 
Defendant Lani Pacific's Emergency Ex Parte Motion for Temporary 
Injunction Filed April 11, 2022" (Denial Order) because the 
Circuit Court has not entered a final, appealable order or 
judgment. See
 Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-1(a) (2016); 
Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure Rules 54(b), 58; 
Jenkins v. 
Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright
, 76 Hawai# i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 
1334, 1338 (1994). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Further, the Denial Order is not independently 
appealable under the collateral-order doctrine, the Forgay1 
doctrine, or HRS ยง 641-1(b). See Greer v. Baker , 137 Hawai# i 
249, 253, 369 P.3d 832, 836 (2016) (setting forth the 
requirements for appealability under the collateral-order doctrine and the 
Forgay doctrine); HRS ยง 641-1(b) (specifying 
requirements for leave to file interlocutory appeal); see also Freddy Nobriga Enter., Inc. v. State Dep't of Hawaiian Home Lands, No. 27358, 2005 WL 2334381, at *1 (Haw. Sept. 22, 2005) (Order Dismissing Appeal). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are 
dismissed.
