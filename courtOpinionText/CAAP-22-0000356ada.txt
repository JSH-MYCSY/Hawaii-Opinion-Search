 to Dismiss f or Violation o f Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure 
Rule 9 (Rule 9 Order ), entered by the Circuit Court of the First 
Circuit on March 28, 2022.  Banares appeals from the portion of 
the circuit court's Rule 9 Order that tolls, pursuant to Hawaii 
Revised Statutes (HRS ) § 706-627 (2014), the period of his 
probation.  Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we vacate the 
circuit court's tolling of Banares's period of probation, and 
the circuit court's conclusions of law (COL ) 5 through 9.  We 
hold that, on the record of this case, in which the circuit 
court did not hear or issue a decision concerning or upon a 
motion to revoke probation , the tolling provision set forth in 
HRS § 706- 627 does not apply to toll the period of Banares's 
probation.  
Banares was charged by felony information with 
Promoting a Dangerous Drug in the Third Degree, in violation of 
HRS § 712-1243 (2014).  Banares plea ded no contest, and in May 
2016, was sentenced to, inter alia , four years of probation.1  On 
February 6, 2017 , the State of Hawai ‘i (State) filed a motion to 
 
1 The Honorable Dean E. Ochiai presided over the sentencing.   The 
Honorable Kevin T. Morikone presided over the February 22, 2022 hearing on 
Banares's February 8, 2022 Motion to Dismiss for Violation of Hawaii Rules of 
Penal Procedure Rule 9 ( Rule 9 Motion to Dismiss ), and issued the Rule 9 
Order. FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 revoke probation ( Motion to Revoke ), and to resentence Banares 
to imprisonment, alleging that Banares violated various terms 
and conditions of his probation.  
In conjunction with the State's Motion to Revoke, the 
circuit court issued a bench warrant on February 7, 2017, for 
Banares's arrest.  The State concedes that the bench warrant was 
not served until almost five years later on January  17, 2022.  
Banares turned himself in to the Honolulu Police Department.  
In February 2022, Banares filed his Rule 9 Motion to 
Dismiss, requesting that his case be dismissed with prejudice.    
Banares contended, pursuant to Hawai‘i Rules of Penal Procedure 
(HRPP) Rule 9, that the delay of almost five years in serving 
him with the bench warrant violated the requirement that 
warrants "shall be executed without unnecessary delay by the 
arrest of the defendant."  HRPP Rule 9(c)(3)(i); State v. Owens, 
116 Hawai‘i 172, 174- 75, 172 P.3d 484, 486- 87 (2007).  Banares 
further contended that he had remained in the jurisdiction and 
was available for service between the dates of February 7, 2017, 
and January 17, 2022.2  The State did not dispute that a Rule 9 
violation had occurred, but objected to a dismissal of Banares's

citation in case number 1DTI -21-095742, and Banares appeared in court on 
September 7, 2021 via Zoom for a hearing on that matter.

 case, and further argued that the period of his probation should 
be tolled pursuant to HRS § 706 -627 (2014).3  The circuit court 
heard the matter, a nd took the parties' arguments under 
advisement.  
On March 28, 2022, the circuit court issued the Rule 9 
Order, in which it declined to dismiss Banares's conviction, 
dismissed the Motion to Revoke,4 and then concluded that 
HRS § 706-627 applied to mandate the tolling of the period of 
 
3  HRS § 706 -627 (2014) provides that,  
 
Tolling of probation.  (1) Upon the filing of a motion to 
revoke a probation or a motion to enlarge the conditions 
imposed thereby, the period of probation shall be tolled 
pending the hearing upon the motion and the decision of the 
court.  The period of tolling shall be computed from the 
filing date of the motion through and including the filing 
date of the written decision of the court concerning the 
motion for purposes of computation of the remaining period 
of probation, if any.  In the  event the court fails to file 
a written decision upon the motion, the period shall be 
computed by reference to the date the court makes a 
decision upon the motion in open court.  During the period 
of tolling of the probation, the defendant shall remain 
subject to all terms and conditions of the probation except 
as otherwise provided by this chapter.  
 
(2) In the event the court, following hearing, refuses to  
revoke the probation or grant the requested enlargement of 
conditions thereof because the defendant 's failure to 
comply therewith was excusable , the defendant may be 
granted the period of tolling of the probation for purposes 
of computation of the remaining probation, if any.  
 
(Emphasi s added.) 
 
4  The circuit court found, and it is not contested, that: "[t]here 
is no evidence that the State made any attempt to serve the warrant at 
issue[;] [t]here is no evidence that [Banares] left the jurisdiction or 
attempted to evade service[;]" and "[t]here is affirmative evidence that 
[Banares] was on the island of O ʻahu on August 2, 2021 when he was cited for a 
traffic infraction."  See Findings of Fact 10 -12. FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 time from the filing of the motion to revoke probation "until 
the decision of the court."  
The circuit court explained its rationale for tolling 
under HRS § 706 -627 in its COLs 5 through 9, as follows,  
5. The plain language of HRS 706-627(1) mandates that the 
time from the filing of a motion to revoke probation "until 
the decision of the court " shall be tolled.  The subsection 
goes on to specify that tolling continues until the 
decision "concerning the motion . . . ."  The common meaning 
of the terms are inclusive and general and do not qualify 
the period based upon whether the decision is made on the 
merits of the motion or not.  No exception is allowed for 
in subsection (1) itself and the only exception provided 
for in statute is in subsection (2).  
 
6. In contrast to HRS 706 -627(1), HRS 706 -627(2) makes a 
single exception to the tolling period mandated by 
subsection (1) solely in the situation where a court 
refuses a motion [to] revoke "because the defendant 's 
failure to comply therewith was excusable. "  Only in such a 
situation is a court given discretion to allow a defendant 
to count time that is otherwise mandated to be tolled to 
the period of her or his probation.  
 
7. The nature of this Court 's ruling on this matter does 
not address whether or not there was any excusable failure 
to comply with any of the conditions of probation.  Thus 
the Court does not have discretion to make an exception to 
the mandatory tolling period prescribed by HRS 706 -627(1). 
 
8. Further, nothing in Owens, supra, nor any other 
authority, provides the Court to otherwise count the tolled 
period mandated by HRS § 706 -627(1) toward the time served 
in the period of probation ordered on May 5, 2017 . 
 
9. Thus the Court does not have discretion to make an 
exception to the mandatory tolling period prescribed by HRS 
706-627(1). 
 
Based on the above COL, the circuit court entered the 
following rulings,  
ACCORDINGLY IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Defendant 
Banares's Motion to Dismiss for Violation of Ha waii Rules 
of Penal Procedure Rule 9 be and the same is hereby GRANTED 
IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.  
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that the motion to 
revoke probation filed February 6, 2017 in the above -
captioned case is hereby dismissed.  
 
IT IS FURTHER HERE BY ORDERED that the time from 
May 5, 2016 to and including February 6, 2017 shall accrue 
toward the period of Defendant 's probation, that the time 
from February 6, 2017 to and including February 23, 2022 
shall be tolled, meaning it shall not accrue toward the 
period of Defendant 's probation, and that time from 
February 23, 2022 forward shall continue to accrue toward 
the period of Defendant 's probation until any future 
intervening factors occur.  
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED THAT as far [as] Defendant 's 
motion req uested that the Judgment of Conviction filed on 
May 5, 2016 or that the entire case be dismissed, those 
requests are DENIED.  
 
Banares raises a single point of error on appeal.  He 
contends that "[t]he circuit court exceeded its authority in 
applying HRS § 706 -627 and tolling tim e. . . .   Based on the 
circuit court 's errors, COLs 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, as well as the 
orders tolling tim e and continuing Banares on probation must be 
reversed."   The State contends on appeal that the circuit 
court's decision below should be affirmed because tolling was 
either mandatory, pursuant to HRS § 706 -627(1), or 
discretionary, pursuant to HRS § 706 -627(2). 
We review the circuit court's conclusions of law de 
novo, under the right/wrong standard of review.  State v. Kido, 
109 Hawai‘ i 458, 461, 128 P.3d 340, 343 (2006).  We conclude the 
circuit court erred in that portion of the Rule 9 Order that 
applies HRS § 706- 627 to toll the time of Banares's probation FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
7 
 from February 6, 2017, to and including February 23, 2022.  
Thus, the circuit court's COLs 5 through 9 are wrong.  
We begin by examining the plain language of HRS § 706-
627.  State v. Borge, 152 Hawai‘i 458, 464, 526 P.3d 435, 441 
(2023) ("[I]mplicit in the task of statutory construction is our 
foremost obligation to ascertain and give effect to the 
intention of the legislature, which is to be obtained primarily 
from the language contained in the statute itself. ") (quoting  
Ito v. Invs. Equity Life Holding Co., 135 Hawai‘i 49, 61, 346 
P.3d 118, 130 (2015)).   
  HRS § 706- 627 applies to toll a period of probation 
pending "the hearing upon the motion [to revoke probation] and 
the decision  of the court ."  HRS § 706-627(1) (emphasis added).  
The period of tolling is calculated in relation to the time in 
which the circuit court issues its written "decision" 
"concerning the motion," or, absent a written decision, 
announces its "decision upon the motion" in open court.  Id.   
The record reflects that there is no such decision in this case. 
The circuit court did not hear or issue a decision on the Motion 
to Revoke due to the State's clear failure to serve the bench 
warrant.    
Indeed, due to the State's Rule 9 violation, the 
circuit court dismissed the State's Motion to Revoke without FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
8 
 reaching any of the issues raised or requests made therein.  As 
the circuit court observed in COL 7, the Rule 9 Order dismissing 
the Motion to Revoke foreclosed its ability to address "whether 
or not there was any excusable failure to comply with any of the 
conditions of probation."  Because the circuit court did not in 
this case hear or issue a "decision" "concerning [or upon] the 
motion [to revoke]," the tolling provision set forth in HRS § 
706-627 cannot apply to toll the period of Banares's probation.    
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate that portion of 
the Rule 9 Order that applies HRS § 706-627 to toll the time of 
Banares's probation from February 6, 2017,  to and including 
February 23, 2022, and COLs 5 through 9, and we remand for 
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
