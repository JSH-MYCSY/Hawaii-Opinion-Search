NO. CAAP-22-0000359 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
DYLAN RIVER JAMES, Defendant-Appellant. 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 5CPC-20-0000051) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By:  Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and Nakasone, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
jurisdiction over the appeal by Defendant-Appellant Dylan River 
James (James) from the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit's 
(circuit court) March 28, 2022 "Order Denying [James]'s Motion in 
Limine #1 Paragraph 'F' Filed on December 20, 2021" (Order 
Denying MIL) because the circuit court improperly certified the 
Order Denying MIL for interlocutory appeal. 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-17 (2016) allows a 
defendant to assert an interlocutory appeal in a criminal matter 
from the circuit court to this court, "[u]pon application made within the time provided by the rules of court."  Hawai# i Rules 
of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 4(b)(1) provides in relevant 
part that a "motion for leave to file an interlocutory appeal 
from an order of the circuit court must be filed within 30 days of the court's entry of the order."  (Emphasis added.)  Here, the circuit court entered its Order Denying MIL on March 28, 2022, making a motion for leave to file an interlocutory appeal due by NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
April 27, 2022.1  However, James did not file his Motion for 
Leave to File Interlocutory Appeal until April 29, 2022, which 
was untimely under HRS ยง 641-17 and HRAP Rule 4(b)(1). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions or 
stipulations are dismissed as moot. 
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, June 23, 2022.
