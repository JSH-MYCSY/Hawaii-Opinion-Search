This matter arises out of an arbitration between 
Navatek, MDG, 2 and Kao, in September and October of 2021 , that 
resulted in the issuance of a Final Award in favor of Navatek 
and MDG. The Final Award, inter alia, awarded $4,537,610.80  in 
punitive damages to MDG. Navatek filed a motion in circuit 
court to confirm the Final Award ; Kao moved to vacate the Final 
Award. After hearing the motions, the circuit court denied

Kao's motion to vacate, granted Navatek's motion to confirm, and 
entered the Final Judgment . This appeal follow ed. 
On appeal, Kao raises three points of error, 
contending that the circuit court erred in: (1) denying Kao's 
motion to vacate the Final Award; (2) granting Navatek's motion 
to confirm the Final Award; and (3) entering COLs 3 and 43 in its 
Order Confirming Award and Order Granting Joinder. 
Upon careful review of the record , briefs, and 
relevant legal authorities , and having given due consideration 
to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties , 
we resolve Kao's points of error as follows : 
"We review the [circuit] court's ruling on [the] 
arbitration award de novo," but are mindful that the circuit 
court's review "is confined to the strictest possible limits and 
[the] [circuit] court may only vacate an award on the grounds 
specified in [Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS)] § 658A -23[ 
(2016)]." Tatibouet v. Ellsworth , 99 Hawaiʻi 226, 233, 54 P.3d 
3 COLs 3 and 4 state: 
3. The [circuit c]ourt, having already denied 
Kao's Motion to Vacate, concludes that there is no basis to 
modify, correct, or vacate the Final Award under Hawaii 
law. 
4. The [circuit c]ourt concludes that the Final 
Award, having been made in good faith by the Arbitrator, 
and there being no basis to modify, correct [,] or vacate 
the Final Award, is binding and conclusive upon the 
parties.

Kao made several arguments to the circuit court, which 
he again raises on appeal,5 in support of his contention that the 
Final Award should be vacated. The circuit court did not make 
FOFs or COLs as to any of Kao 's contentions . However, the 
circuit court explained its ruling with respect to Kao's 
contention that the Arbitrator exceeded its authority in 
awarding punitive damages . The circuit court also explained its 
ruling as to Kao's contention that the Arbitrator erroneously 
5 Kao asserts the following arguments for why the Final Award 
should have been vacated: "(1) The Arbitrator refused to postpone the 
hearing"; (2) "Kao was denied a fair hearing because he was required to 
submit to a hearing in which his voice would be silent due to his invocation 
of his constitutional right against self -incrimination"; (3) Th e award, in 
effect, was a penalty for his invocation of his right against self -
incrimination; (4) The Arbitrator erred in awarding punitive damages; (5) The 
Arbitrator exceeded his authority by "purporting to apply a 'beyond a 
reasonable doubt' standard an d determining that [Kao] violated criminal 
laws"; (6) The Arbitrator's award of punitive damages shows the Arbitrator's 
bias against Kao; (7) The Arbitrator demonstrated evident partiality by 
"raising the issue of punitive damages sua sponte "; (8) The Final Award 
violates public policy; (9) The Arbitrator exceeded his authority when he 
awarded excessive attorneys' fees and costs; and (10) The Arbitrator erred in 
denying Kao's motion to disqualify Vernon Woo and the Starn O'Toole Marcus & 
Fisher law firm.

denied his  motion to stay  the arbitration  due to the 
Arbitrator's misapplication of  the factors set forth in Keating 
v. Off.  of Thrift Supervision, 45 F.3d 322, 324-25 (9th Cir. 
1995).  We therefore address those specific contentions as 
follows.   6
First, with regard to punitive damages, HRS § 658A -
21(a) (2016) provides, in relevant part, that "[a] n arbitrator 
may award punitive damages . . . if such an award is authorized 
by law in a civil action involving the same claim and the 
evidence produced at the hearing justifies the award under the 
legal standards otherwise applicable to the claim. " 
Here, at least some of the claims that Navatek alleged  
in its Demand for Arbitration, such as the claims  for  fraud and 
breach of fiduciary duty, are tort claims  for which  punitive 
damages are permitted. See  TSA Int'l Ltd. v. Shimizu Corp., 
92  Hawaiʻi 243, 264, 990 P.2d 713, 734 (1999) (concluding that 
claims for fraud and breach of fiduciary duty are tort claims); 
Llanes v. Bank of Am., N.A., 154 Hawai ʻi 423, 429, 555 P.3d 110, 
116 (2024) (noting that punitive damages is an awardable 
In September 2020, prior to the arbitration proceedings, the 
United States Department of Justice filed a criminal complaint against Kao 
based on allegations that Kao had "fraudulently obtained more than $12.8 
million in Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP") funds on behalf of [MDG] " and 
then subsequently "transferred approximately $2 million to himself. " In May 
2021, after the arbitration proceedings had commenced, Kao filed a motion to 
stay the arbitration until his federal criminal case was resolved.

category in tort actions) . Moreover, it appears from the 
multiple testimonies presented during arbitration that there was 
clear and convincing evidence that Kao "intended to harm 
[Navatek and/or MDG], or recklessly disregarded a substantial 
risk of harm to [Navatek and/or MDG], or otherwise acted in an 
outrageous or malicious manner ."7 See Guieb v. Guieb , No. SCWC -
20-0000727, 2025 WL 1806355, at *5 (Haw. July 1, 2025 ) (citation 
omitted) (stating the standard the plaintiff must meet to 
recover punitive damages) . We therefore conclude that the 
circuit court did not err in finding that the Arbitrator did not 
exceed its authority in awarding punitive damages . 
Second, we address Kao's contention that the 
Arbitrator erred in denying his motion to stay the arbitration 
until after the resolution of his criminal proceedings because 
the Arbitrator did not properly apply the Keating factors. In 
the instant case, the circuit court found, after reviewing the 
Arbitrator's application of the Keating factors, that the 
Arbitrator did not abuse its discretion in denying Kao's motion 
to stay. 
7 For example, Steven C. H. Loui, Navatek's President, testified 
about the undisclosed distributions to Kao, Kao's use of company funds to pay 
for personal criminal matters not covered by the Operating Agreement , and 
Kao's other fraudulent and illegal conduct. 
Tom Simon, a private investigator , also testified about emails 
sent to and by Kao that demonstrated Kao's purported intention to engage in 
fraudulent activities.

"It is well settled that arbitration awards may not be 
vacated . . . [even] if the arbitrators commit a legal or 
factual error in reaching its final decision." Tatibouet, 
99  Hawaiʻi at 236, 54  P.3d at 407 (citation omitted); see also  
Haw. State Tchrs. Ass'n, 140 Hawaiʻ i at 391-92, 400 P.3d at 592-
93 (noting that parties who agree to arbitrate assume all the 
risks of arbitration such as the arbitrator's incorrect 
application of the law). We determine, on this basis, that  the 
circuit court did not err in deferring to the Arbitrator's 
application of the Keating  factors.  
We must also address, however, whether the circuit 
court adequately considered the mandate of HRS § 658A -23(a)(3) 
(2016). HRS § 658A -23(a)(3) provides that the circuit court 
shall vacate an arbitration award if "[the] arbitrator refuse d 
to postpone the hearing upon showing of sufficient cause for 
postponement . . . so as to prejudice substantially the rights 
of a party to the arbitration proceeding." 
The record reflects that , in applying the Keating 
factors, the Arbitrator expressly addressed Kao's argument that 
"conducting the [arbitration] proceedings while the criminal 
matters were pending risked violating [Kao's] state and federal 
constitutional privileges against self -incrimination and was 
otherwise inherently prejudicial." In so doing, t he Arbitrator

      NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
considered whether the lack of a postponement would " prejudice 
substantially the rights " of Kao. The circuit court found that 
the Arbitrator "meticulously weighed the evidence on each of the 
five factors that comprised the [Keating] test and concluded 
that there was an insufficient basis to postpone the 
arbitration." On this record, we determine that the circuit 
court's denial of Kao's motion to vacate did not violate HRS § 
658A-23(a)(3). 
Finally, as noted above, the circuit court did 
not enter FOFs and/or COLs or otherwise state its rationale for 
rejecting Kao's other asserted grounds for vacating the Final 
Award, and therefore, we are unable to discern its 
reasoning. Accordingly, we are unable to determine whether the 
circuit court adequately considered the remaining grounds8 that 
Kao asserted in support of his motion to vacate. We therefore 
vacate the Final Judgment , and instruct the circuit court, on 
remand, to address these contentions . 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the Final 
Judgment and Order Denying Motion to Vacate , and we vacate in 
part and affirm in part the Order Confirming Award and Order
