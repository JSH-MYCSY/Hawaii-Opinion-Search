APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 1CC141002192) 
ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL 
(By:  Leonard, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Chan, JJ.)  
Upon consideration of the Motion to Dismiss Appeal and 
for an Award of Attorneys' Fees and Costs (Motion to Dismiss) 
filed August 5, 2022, by Plaintiff/Counterclaim Defendant-
Appellee U.S. Bank National Association, the papers in support and in opposition, and the record, it appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction over self-represented Defendant/ Counterclaimant-Appellant Phyllis Kehaulani Duncan Chun's (Chun) 
appeal from the Circuit Court of the First Circuit's (Circuit 
Court) interlocutory "Order Denying Counterclaim Defendant U.S. 
Bank National Association as Trustee for the Certificateholders 
Citigroup Mortgage Loan Trust Inc. Asset-Backed Pass through Certificates Series 2007-AHL3's Motion for Summary Judgment as to Counterclaim, Filed January 28, 2022" (Denial Order), entered 
April 13, 2022, in JIMS 1CC141002192, because the Circuit Court NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
has not entered a final, appealable judgment pursuant to Hawaii 
Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 641-1(a) or 667-51, see Jenkins v. 
Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai# i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 
1334, 1338 (1994) ("An appeal may be taken from circuit court 
orders resolving claims against parties only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]"), and the Denial Order is not an appealable order under the collateral order doctrine, the Forgay doctrine, or HRS § 641-1(b) (2016).  See Greer v. Baker, 137 Hawai# i 249, 253, 369 
P.3d 832, 836 (2016) (reciting the requirements for appeals under the collateral order doctrine and the Forgay doctrine); HRS § 641-1(b) (requirements for leave to file an interlocutory appeal). 
As this court has no jurisdiction to consider the 
appeal on the merits, we deny the request for attorneys' fees made under Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 38, without 
prejudice to a subsequent motion before the Circuit Court or, in the event that a new appeal is perfected to this court, before this court.  See, e.g., Yoneji v. Yoneji, CAAP-13-0003566 (App. Mar. 5, 2014) (Order Denying Without Prejudice Motion for Attorney's Fees). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion to 
Dismiss is granted in part and denied in part as follows:  
(1) The request to dismiss the appeal is granted.  The 
appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
(2) The request for an award of attorneys' fees and 
costs is denied without prejudice. 
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, September 9, 2022.
