APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1CCV-20-0001364) 
  
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Wadsworth, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
In this secondary appeal, self-represented Appellant-
Appellant Hye Ja Choi ( Choi
 ) challenges her disqualification 
from unemployment benefits for work-related misconduct under 
Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 383-20(2).  We affirm. 1
1 HRS § 383-30(2) (2015), entitled "Disqualification for benefits,"
provides that "[a]n individual shall be disqualified for benefits" if "the
individual has been discharged for misconduct connected with work[.]"

Choi appeals from the Circuit Court of the First 
Circuit's ( Circuit Court )2 May 11, 2022 "Order Affirming 
Appellee[-Appellee] Department of Labor and Industrial 
Relations' [( DLIR)] Decision, Dated September 4, 2020" ( Order 
Affirming DLIR Decision ) and "Final Judgment." The May 11, 2022 
Order Affirming DLIR Decision affirmed the September 4, 2020 
"Decision in the Matter of: 2004430" by the DLIR Employment 
Security Appeals Referees' Office ( ESARO Decision ) disqualifying 
Choi from unemployment benefits. 
While Choi's Opening Brief does not comply with Hawai ʻi 
Rules of Appellate Procedure ( HRAP
) in multiple respects, 
containing no points of error, record references, or argument 
citing to "parts of the record relied on[,]" see HRAP Rule 
28(b)(3), (b)(4), and (b)(7), we endeavor to afford "litigants the opportunity to have their cases heard on the merits, where 
possible." Marvin v. Pflueger, 127 Hawai ‘i 490, 496, 280 P.3d 
88, 94 (2012) (cleaned up). We liberally interpret pleadings 
prepared by self-represented parties to promote access to 
justice and afford them appellate review, despite their non-
compliance with court rules. See Erum v. Llego, 147 Hawai ‘i 368, 
380-81, 465 P.3d 815, 827-28 (2020). 
We thus address Choi's 
arguments to the extent they are discernible. 
On appeal, Choi appears to argue (1) that the Circuit 
Court erred by affirming the ESARO Decision that found Choi was 
discharged for work-related misconduct; and (2)
 that the DLIR 
"fail[ed] to provide language services" to Choi, and that Choi

did not have "an opportunity to pr[esent] oral statements, 
evidence and witnesses[.]"3 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve Choi's contentions as follows. 
On March 30, 2020, Choi was terminated from her job as 
a "part-time tour guide" for Appellee-Appellee Tachibana Enterprises, LLC ( Employer ). 
On June 3, 2020, the Unemployment Insurance Division 
(UID) issued a "Notice of Unemployment Insurance Decision" ( UID 
Decision ), determining that Choi was not disqualified from 
receiving unemployment benefits because Choi was "not discharged for misconduct connected with work" under HRS § 383-30(2). 
On June 9, 2020, Employer appealed the June 3, 2020 
UID Decision, arguing that Choi was "involuntarily terminated for unprofessional conduct and insubordination." 
On July 8, 2020, a telephonic hearing was held before 
the ESARO Appeals Officer. Choi did not call in for the 
hearing. The Appeals Officer entered Employer's exhibits into 
evidence, and noted that Choi sent in 39 pages of "additional documents" after the hearing was scheduled; however, the documents were not entered because Choi did not send a copy to Employer and was not present at the hearing. The Appeals Officer explained that Choi could present the documents if she 
requested to reopen the appeal and was granted another hearing. 
3 We do not address Choi's additional contention that she was 
"disqualified" [sic] from "attend[ing] the first hearing" on July 8, 2020
before the ESARO appeals officer ( Appeals Officer ), where the Appeals Officer
granted Choi's request to reopen the hearing, and a subsequent hearing washeld on August 24, 2020. Assuming arguendo any error occurred, it washarmless.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST' S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
Employer testified that Choi refused to sign an acknowledgment 
for a "revised [employee] handbook" and was given a "written warning" for "[i]nsubordination[.]" Employer presented witnesses and exhibits regarding two February 2020 customer service complaints against Choi. 
On July 9, 2020, the Appeals Officer reversed the June 
3, 2020 UID Decision that Choi was eligible for unemployment benefits, and determined that Choi was "discharged for misconduct connected with work[,]" and therefore "disqualified for benefits." ( Initial ESARO Decision ) 
On July 24, 2020, Choi requested a reopening of the 
July 9, 2020 Initial ESARO Decision because "she mistakenly 
thought the Appeals Officer would be calling her and that she 
did not have to call in advance." Choi's request was granted, and a hearing was scheduled for August 24, 2020. 
At the August 24, 2020 telephonic hearing, Choi was 
provided a Japanese interpreter as requested. The Appeals Officer entered Choi's "forty-page document" and an additional "nineteen pages of additional evidence" submitted by Choi; and 
went over the "previous documents that were entered" at the 
prior hearing. Choi testified and cross-examined Employer's witness; and Choi was informed that she could "call witnesses if she want[ed]." While testifying, Choi was repeatedly requested to state "one sentence at a time" to "let the interpreter interpret first," but Choi had difficulty doing so. Because of 
this difficulty, Choi agreed to let the Appeals Officer admit 
into the record her prior statement regarding her discharge that she had previously submitted. 
The Appeals Officer's September 4, 2020 ESARO Decision 
reaffirmed the July 9, 2020 Initial ESARO Decision, noted that Employer and Choi disputed the facts, and found Employer's

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST' S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
"overall testimony and evidence to be more consistent and 
credible." The ESARO Decision found that Choi was terminated as a result of the following incidents: a March 16, 2020 "written warning for insubordination" for "repeated non-compliance" for refusing to sign an acknowledgment for the revised employee handbook; a February 17, 2020 "[c]ustomer [s]ervice [c]omplaint" 
for "violation of . . . airport security regulations" by 
attempting to have a "passenger with a baby go through the 'Gold Lane' security checkpoint instead of the regular ticketed security checkpoint"; and a February 20, 2020 "[c]ustomer [s]ervice [c]omplaint" for making "a loud false statement to airline staff." The ESARO Decision concluded that Choi's 
termination was a result of "gross neglect of duty and a 
deliberate disregard of the standards of behavior an employer has a right to expect of an employee,"
4 and thus, Choi "was 
discharged for misconduct connected with work." 
Choi appealed to the Circuit Court, and following an 
April 1, 2022 hearing,5 the Circuit Court filed its May 11, 2022 
Order Affirming DLIR Decision. Choi timely appealed to this 
court. 
On secondary appeal, "[t]he standard of review is one 
in which this court must determine whether the circuit court was 
4 The Appeals Officer cited to Hawai ʻi Administrative Rules ( HAR) §
12-5-51, which explains in subsection (c), that work-related misconduct
"consists of actions which show a wilful or wanton disregard of the
employer's interests[.]" Subsection (e)(2), (e)(4), and (e)(5) provide thatsuch misconduct may include an "[a]ltercation at work[,]" "gross neglect ofduty[,]" or the "[e]mployee's wilful disobedience of employer's directives oremployee's insubordination[.]"

Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawaiʻi 225, 230, 909 P.2d 553, 558 (1995)

right or wrong in its decision, applying the standards set forth 
in HRS § 91-14(g) . . . to the agency's decision." Flores v.
Bd. of Land & Nat. Res.
, 143 Hawaiʻi 114, 120, 424 P.3d 469, 475 
(2018) (citation omitted). 
(1) Choi appears to challenge the Circuit Court and 
ESARO decisions by arguing that she was discharged for circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and not for work-related misconduct. 
These are factual determinations that 
turn on the Appeals Officer's resolution of any conflicts in witnesses' testimonies or other evidence. 
"[C]ourts decline to consider the weight of the 
evidence to ascertain whether it weighs in favor of the 
administrative findings, or to review the agency's findings of 
fact by passing upon the credibility of witnesses or conflicts in testimony[.]" Application of Hawaiian Elec. Co., Inc., 81 
Hawaiʻi 459, 465, 918 P.2d 561, 567 (1996) (citation omitted). 
Here, the Appeals Officer found, based on Employer's 
"more consistent and credible" "testimony and evidence," that 
Choi "was discharged for misconduct connected with work" because 
of the March 16, 2020 insubordination warning, and two customer service complaints in February 2020. Choi does not present argument regarding why these findings are clearly erroneous and not supported by the record. 
(2) Choi appears to argue that her "legal rights were 
infringed by [DLIR]'s failure to provide language services[,]" and that DLIR "refus[ed] [sic]" Choi "to submit evidence and . . . witnesses[.]" 
Here, the record of the August 24, 2020 hearing 
reflects that: Choi was provided a Japanese interpreter as requested; Choi presented testimony and cross-examined 
Employer's witness; and Choi submitted a "forty-page document"

and "nineteen pages of additional evidence" into evidence. 
Choi's argument is not supported by this record. 
We conclude the Circuit Court did not err in affirming 
the ESARO Decision. See Flores
, 143 Hawaiʻi at 120-21, 424 P.3d 
at 475-76. 
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Circuit 
Court's May 11, 2022 Order Affirming DLIR Decision and Final Judgment.
