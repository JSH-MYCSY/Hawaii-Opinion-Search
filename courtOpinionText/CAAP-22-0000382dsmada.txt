APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 1CC131000042) 
ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL 
(By: Leonard, Acting C.J., and Wadsworth and Nakasone, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of the January 16, 2024 motion for 
order dismissing appeal (Motion to Dismiss), filed by Plaintiff-
Appellee Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, as Owner Trustee 
of The Residential Credit Opportunities Trust V-D (Wilmington), 
the papers in support, the record, and there being no opposition: 
1. Defendant-Appellant Donnalyn M. Mosier (Mosier), 
now known as Donnalyn Morgan, appeals from the following orders NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
and judgment, entered in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit: 
(a) the February 16, 2022 "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law 
and Order Granting [Wilmington's] Motion for Summary Judgment 
Against All Defendants and for Interlocutory Decree of 
Foreclosure"; (b) the February 16, 2022 "Judgment"; (c) the June 
2, 2022 "Order Denying [Mosier's] Non-Hearing Motion to 
Reconsider the Court's 'Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and 
Order Granting [WilminGton's] Motion for Summary Judgment Against 
All Defendants and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure,' 
and (2) 'Judgment', Filed February 28, 2022"; and (d) the June 6, 
2022 "Order Denying [Mosier's] Non-Hearing Motion to Set Aside 
the Clerk's Entry of Default, Filed February 28, 2022." 
2. On January 16, 2024, Wilmington filed the Motion 
to Dismiss, by which Wilmington sought dismissal of this appeal 
as moot, on the grounds that Mosier did not obtain a stay and the 
property at issue (Property) was sold to a third-party, good-
faith purchaser, Thoai Pham (Pham), at the foreclosure sale.  
3. The Motion to Dismiss is supported by a 
Declaration of Counsel, which attaches, among other documents: 
(a) a "true and correct copy" of the Circuit Court's July 25, 
2023 "Order Confirming Foreclosure Sale, Approving Commissioner's 
Report, Allowance of Commissioner's Fees, Attorneys' Fees, Costs, 
Directing Conveyance and for Writ of Ejectment" (Confirmation 
Order); and (b) a "true and correct certified copy" of a 
"Commissioner's Deed," recorded on October 30, 2023, in the State 
of Hawai#i Bureau of Conveyances. The Confirmation Order, among 
other things, confirms the sale of the Property to Pham or his nominee; states that Pham is a "good-faith" purchaser"; orders 
the Commissioner to convey the Property to Pham or his nominee 
upon receipt of the full purchase price; and states that upon 
delivery of the conveyance, Pham or his nominee, "as a good-faith 
purchaser," is entitled to possession of the Property. The 
Commissioner's Deed conveys the property to several grantees 
identified as Pham's nominees.

4. Mosier filed no response to the Motion to Dismiss. 
5. On March 12, 2024, Pham filed a motion for order 
for entry of Stipulation to Limit Legal Remedy of [Mosier's] 
Appeal, If Any, to Money Damages (Motion re Stipulation). The 
stipulation attached to the motion is signed by counsel for 
Mosier, Wilmington, and Pham. 
6. Under Hawai# i law, mootness is an issue of 
justiciability. See State v. Hewitt, 153 Hawai# i 33, 42, 526 
P.3d 558, 567 (2023). 
7. The mootness doctrine applies "where events 
subsequent to the judgment of the trial court have so affected the relations between the parties that the two conditions for 
justiciability relevant on appeal — adverse interest and 
effective remedy — have been compromised." Hamilton ex rel. 
Lethem v. Lethem, 119 Hawai# i 1, 5, 193 P.3d 839, 843 (2008). 
8. We take judicial notice of the Confirmation Order 
and the Commissioner's Deed. See HRE Rule 201; State v. Abdon, 
137 Hawai# i 19, 26, 364 P.3d 917, 924 (2016) ("The most frequent 
use of judicial notice of ascertainable facts is in noticing the content of court records." (quoting State v. Akana, 68 Haw. 164, 
165, 706 P.2d 1300, 1302 (1985))); In re Thomas H. Gentry 
Revocable Tr., 138 Hawai# i 158, 171 n.8, 378 P.3d 874, 887 n.8 
(2016) (taking judicial notice of a warranty deed transferring property because the deed was a matter of public record and 
easily verifiable); U.S. Bank Trust, N.A. as Trustee for LSF9 
Master Participation Trust v. Ass'n of Apartment Owners of 
Waikoloa Hills Condominium Phase I, 150 Hawai# i 573, 584 n.12, 
506 P.3d 869, 880 n.12 (App. 2022) (taking judicial notice of commissioner's apartment deed recorded in the Bureau of 
Conveyances). 
9. It is undisputed that Mosier did not post a 
supersedeas bond or otherwise obtain a stay. the Circuit Court 
determined, and Mosier does not dispute, that Pham or his 
nominees are third-party, good-faith purchasers of the Property. 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
In these circumstances, no effective relief can be granted to 
Mosier with respect to her appeal; it has therefore been rendered 
moot. See Bank of New York Mellon v. R. Onaga, Inc., 140 Hawai# i 
358, 370, 400 P.3d 559, 571 (2017). 
10. No exceptions to the mootness doctrine apply to 
this case. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion to 
Dismiss is granted, and the appeal is dismissed as moot. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Motion re Stipulation is 
dismissed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, August 5, 2024.
