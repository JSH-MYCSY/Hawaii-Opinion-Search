APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: Nakasone, Presiding Judge, McCullen and Guidry, JJ.)  
Defendants/Cross-claimants/Cross-claim-Defendants-
Appellants Trustees of the Estate of Bernice Pauahi Bishop doing 
business as Kamehameha Schools appeal from the Circuit Court of   
 
 
 
  
 
   
 
   
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the First Circuit's May 23, 2022 order granting Defendant/Cross-
claim-Defendant/Cross-claimant-Appellee St. Francis Medical 
Center's petition for determination of good faith settlement and 
Plaintiff-Appellee Andrew J. Vliet, III's (Vliet) joinder (Good 
Faith Settlement Order).1 
For a brief background, Vliet sued Kamehameha Schools 
and St. Francis pursuant to Hawai‘ i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 657-
1.8 (2016), which permits certain actions "for recovery of damages based on physical, psychological, or other injury or 
condition suffered by a minor arising from the sexual abuse of 
the minor by any person" that would otherwise be time-barred. Vliet identified Robert McCormick Browne (Dr. Browne), formerly 
employed as Chief of Psychiatry at St. Francis, as having 
sexually abused him when he was a student at Kamehameha Schools. 
Kamehameha Schools filed a cross-claim against 
St. Francis. St. Francis filed its answer and a cross-claim 
against Kamehameha Schools. Kamehameha Schools then filed a 
cross-claim against Dr. Browne's Estate.
2 According to the court 
minutes, Vliet entered into separate settlement agreements with both St. Francis and Kamehameha Schools. St. Francis then petitioned for a determination of good faith settlement, which 
1 The Honorable Dean E. Ochiai presided. 
2 Dr. Browne is deceased and his Estate is a nominal party in this 
appeal.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
was granted. The circuit court entered its Good Faith 
Settlement Order. Kamehameha Schools appealed from that order. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve the 
points of error as discussed below and affirm. 
Kamehameha Schools contends the circuit court erred in 
concluding that, under HRS § 663-15.5 (2016), the good faith 
settlement between Vliet and St. Francis barred Kamehameha Schools' cross-claims for breach of contract, negligence, 
indemnification, and attorneys' fees pursuant to Uyemura v. 
Wick, 57 Haw. 102, 551 P.2d 171 (1976). 
When a court determines a settlement was made in good 
faith, HRS § 663-15.5(d) bars joint tortfeasors from making 
claims against the settling tortfeasor except for claims based 
on a written indemnity agreement: 
(d) A determination by the court that a settlement was 
made in good faith shall: 
(1) Bar any other joint tortfeasor . . . from any 
further claims against the settling tortfeasor 
. . . except those based on a written indemnity 
agreement; and 
(2) Result in a dismissal of all cross- claims filed 
against the settling joint tortfeasor . . . except those based on a written indemnity agreement. 
HRS § 663-15.5(d) (formatting altered).

Here, Kamehameha Schools' cross-claims, including its 
breach of contract and Uyemura claims, arise out of the 
"original injury" to Vliet caused by Dr. Browne's abuse and are 
"directly or indirectly" in the nature of contribution and 
indemnity claims. See Abad v. Griffith
, 155 Hawaiʻi 223, 560 
P.3d 478, Nos. CAAP-21-0000120 and CAAP-23-0000015, 2024 WL 
5088457, at *5 (App. Dec. 12, 2024) (SDO) (concluding the 
approval of a good faith settlement "requires dismissal of only 
those crossclaims against a settling joint tortfeasor raised in 
the capacity of a joint tortfeasor, i.e., those seeking 
contribution or indemnity (directly or indirectly) for the injury (to the complainant) that is the subject of the good 
faith settlement"). 
The circuit court dismissed all cross-claims and 
third-party claims "now pending" against St. Francis and barred 
"any further claims" against St. Francis "in connection with 
this litigation, except those based upon a written indemnity 
agreement." 
The circuit court's dismissal of Kamehameha 
Schools' cross-claims against St. Francis, and its discharge of St. Francis "from any and all liability for any contribution to any other party, joint tortfeasor and/or co-obligor[,]" is 
consistent with the underlying purpose of HRS § 663-15.5 -

protecting settling tortfeasors from contribution claims brought 
by other joint tortfeasors. Seeid. 
Thus, the circuit did not err in concluding that the 
good faith settlement between Vliet and St. Francis barred 
Kamehameha Schools' cross-claims for breach of contract, 
negligence, indemnification, and attorneys' fees. 
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the circuit court's 
May 23, 2022 Good Faith Settlement Order.
