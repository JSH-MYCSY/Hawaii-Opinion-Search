APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT  COURT OF THE FIRST  CIRCUIT  
WAI‘ANAE DIVISION  
(CASE NO. 1DRC-21-0005397)  
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION  ORDER  
(By:  Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and Guidry, JJ.)  
Defendants-Appellants Guy K. Barrett and Ronette 
Barrett (collectively, the Barretts) appeal from the District 
Court of the First Circuit's (district court)1 May 17, 2022 
Judgment for Possession. They raise three points of error, 
contending that the district court abused its discretion when: 
1 The Honorable Darolyn H. Lendio entered the Judgment for 
Possession. The Honorable Michelle N. Comeau presided over the April 26, 
2022 hearing on Plaintiff-Appellee Mervina Kaukini Mamo Cash-Kaeo's (Cash-
Kaeo) motion for summary judgment (MSJ).

(1) "it defaulted [the Barretts] for [their] non[-]appearance 
[at the MSJ hearing] where the facts show [the Barretts had] 
defended themselves in this action by retaining counsel" who 
"made eight court appearances at hearings in defense of [the 
Barretts]"; (2) "it applied the extreme sanctions methodology" 
by entering default judgment against the Barretts "for the 
failure of their counsel to appear at the hearing on [Cash-
Kaeo's] [MSJ]"; and (3) "it allowed the hearing on [Cash-Kaeo's] 
[MSJ] to proceed without first addressing [counsel's] non[-
]appearance at this hearing." 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve the 
Barretts' appeal as follows. 
The Barretts contend that the district court entered 
default judgment against them pursuant to District Court Rules 
of Civil Procedure (DCRCP) Rule 55. The record reflects , 
however, that the district court entered the May 17, 2022 
Judgment for Possession against the Barretts because Cash-Kaeo 
demonstrated she was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of 
law under DCRCP Rule 56. Pursuant to DCRCP Rule 56(c), a motion 
for summary judgment may be granted "if the pleadings, 
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, 
together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no 
2

genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party 
is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." We review the 
grant or denial of summary judgment de novo. Kanahele v. State, 
154 Hawaiʻi 190, 201, 549 P.3d 275, 286 (2024). 
The Barretts point to no evidence in the record 
indicating a genuine issue of material fact disputing that Cash-
Kaeo is the sole surviving lessee of the subject property, and 
that Cash-Kaeo is therefore entitled to judgment of possession 
against the Barretts as a matter of law. The Barretts also cite 
no authority indicating the district court was required to 
address their counsel's non-appearance at the MSJ hearing before 
it could grant the MSJ. Even if the district court was required 
to do so, the Barretts fail to identify any legal theory or 
issue of fact that could have or would have been presented in 
opposition to the MSJ to defeat the motion. 
We therefore conclude the district court did not err 
in granting the MSJ, and affirm the May 17, 2022 Judgment for 
Possession.
