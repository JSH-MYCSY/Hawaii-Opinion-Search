NOS. CAAP-22-0000393 AND CAAP-22-0000510 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
AERICA CATES, individually and as Guardian Prochien Ami
for JANE DOE, a minor, Plaintiffs-Appellants, v.
STATE OF HAWAI# I; NICK PRIETO, Defendants-Appellees, and
J
OHN DOES 1-10, Defendants. 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 5CC181000124) 
ORDER (1) DISMISSING APPEAL IN CAAP-22-0000393 AND
(2) DENYING MOTION TO CONSOLIDATE APPEALS IN CAAP-22-0000510
(By: 
Leonard, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and Chan, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of Plaintiff-Appellant Aerica 
Cates's (Cates
) October 20, 2022 "Motion to Consolidate Appeals 
in CAAP-22-393 and CAAP-22-510" (Motion), filed in case numbers 
CAAP-22-0000393 and CAAP-22-0000510, the papers in support, and 
the record in case numbers CAAP-22-0000393 and CAAP-22-0000510, it appears that: 
(1) Cates seeks to consolidate the appeals in case 
numbers CAAP-22-0000393 and CAAP-22-0000510; 
(2) In case number CAAP-22-0000393, Cates appeals from 
the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit's (Circuit Court) May 27, 
2022 "Order Granting Defendant State of Hawaii's Motion for 
Summary Judgment, Filed on April 4, 2022" (MSJ Order); 
(3)
 Thereafter, the Circuit Court clerk filed a Clerk's 
Taxation of Costs (Clerk's Taxation) in favor of Defendant-
Appellee State of Hawai# i (State) and against Cates pursuant to 
Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 54(d)(1), and the 
Circuit Court entered judgment (Judgment) in favor of the State  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and against Cates, in accordance with the MSJ Order and the 
Clerk's Taxation, which further dismissed all remaining claims; 
(4) In case number CAAP-22-0000510, Cates appeals from 
the MSJ Order, Clerk's Taxation, and Judgment. The Judgment is a final, appealable judgment, HRCP Rule 58, Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai# i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 
1338 (1994), and the notice of appeal filed in CAAP-22-0000510 was timely, Hawai
#i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 4(a)(1); 
and 
(5) Therefore, the appeal in case number CAAP-22-
0000393 is duplicative and unnecessary, as the court will review all prior interlocutory orders, including the MSJ Order, when it considers the appeal in case number CAAP-22-0000510 on the merits. Ueoka v. Szymanski
, 107 Hawai# i 386, 396, 114 P.3d 892, 
902 (2005). Accordingly, the court will 
sua sponte dismiss the 
appeal in case number CAAP-22-0000393, making the requests for consolidation moot. Ogeone v. Au, No. CAAP-18-0000190, 2019 WL 
972542, at *1 (App. Feb. 27, 2019) (Order). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal in case 
number CAAP-22-0000393 is dismissed as unnecessary, and all pending motions in CAAP-22-0000393 are dismissed as moot. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Motion filed in CAAP-22-
0000510 is denied as moot. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the appellate clerk shall 
file this order in case numbers CAAP-22-0000393 and CAAP-22
-
0000510. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, November 7, 2022.
