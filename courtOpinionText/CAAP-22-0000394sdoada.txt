APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 1CC161001062) 
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: 
Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, McCullen and Guidry, JJ.) 
Self-represented Defendant-Appellant Gabi Kim Collins   
appeals from the Circuit Court of the First Circuit's March 10, 
2022 judgment entered on an interlocutory decree of foreclosure 
(
Judgment).   On appeal, Collins raises five points of error 
(POE) challenging the foreclosure decree in favor of Plaintiff-1

Appellee The Bank of New York Mellon fka the Bank of New York, 
as Trustee for the Certificateholders of CWALT, Inc. Alternative 
Loan Trust 2006-12CB, Mortgage Pass-Thru Certificates Series 
2006-12CB (BONY).2 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve the 
points of error as discussed below, and affirm. 
(1) Collins first contends the circuit "court gravely 
erred when it determined that [BONY] had satisfied the requirements of standing at inception, in regards to both BONY 
and the purported servicers" (POE 1).
3 (Formatting altered.) 
Collins thus argues that summary judgment "was in error due to failure to prove standing." (Formatting altered.) 
A person is entitled to enforce an instrument when the 
person is "the holder of the instrument." Hawaiʻi Revised 
2 However, we deem POE 2 waived as no argument on this point was 
presented in the argument section of Collins's opening brief. Hawai‘i Rules 
of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(7) ("Points not argued may be deemed 
waived."). In POE 2, Collins contends the circuit "court gravely erred when 
it failed to view the factual evidence for [summary judgment] in light most 
favorable to the person opposing the motion, which was [Collins]." 
(Formatting altered.) 
3 Collins also challenges standing by asserting the assignment of 
mortgage was void as Countryw ide "was out of business"; "the Note reveals 
alterations and endorsement fraud"; "BONY took opposing positions in two different courts"; "BONY's acceptance of $8.5B settlement barred its claims "; 
"power of attorneys invalid and failed to grant authority to servicer"; and "servicer's counterfeit loan numbers rejected[.]" (Formatting altered.) After review, we determine these assertions did not raise genuine issues of 
material fact as to BONY's standing to foreclose.

Statutes (HRS) § 490:3-301 (2008). A promissory note is a 
negotiable instrument, and a lender is entitled to enforce the 
note if it is the holder. See Bank of Am., N.A. v. Reyes-
Toledo, 139 Hawai i ‘ 361, 369, 369 n.14, 370-71, 390 P.3d 1248, 
1256, 1256 n.14, 1257-58 (2017).  The foreclosing party may 
establish it is the holder of a note by showing that its agent 
physically possessed the note. See generally U.S. Bank Tr.,
N.A. as Tr. for LSF9 Master Participation Tr. v. Verhagen, 149 
Hawaiʻi 315, 317, 327-28, 489 P.3d 419, 421, 431-32 (2021). We 
review the grant of summary judgment de novo. U.S. Bank N.A. v.Mattos, 140 Hawaiʻ i 26, 30, 398 P.3d 615, 619 (2017). 
To establish it possessed the promissory note (
Note) 
when it filed the complaint, BONY attached the following to its 
second motion for summary judgment: 
1. An Affidavit of Bank of America, N.A. (BANA) as Master Servicer, in which the declarant, Assistant Vice 
President Nichole Renee Williams, testified that 
BANA's records confirm that BANA transmitted the original blank-indorsed Note to BONY's counsel, The 
Mortgage Law Firm (TMLF), at their California office 
on or about June 5, 2012. The testimony was supported 
by a "Transmittal Report" and "Instance Summary[,]" 
confirming the transfer. 
3   
 
 
  
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2. A declaration of Sylvia Meregillano (Meregillano), 
custodian of records for TMLF. Meregillano testified 
that TMLF received the original blank-indorsed Note on 
June 28, 2012, before the complaint was filed, and 
that TMLF was still in possession of the Note on 
April 21, 2017, after the complaint was filed. An 
April 21, 2017 "Bailee Letter - Updated" from TMLF, 
acknowledging TMLF's possession of the original blank-indorsed Note on that date, supported the testimony. 
3. A declaration of Document Coordinator Sandra Burgess, an employee of Bayview Loan Servicing, LLC (Bayview), 
the sub-servicer of the subject mortgage (Mortgage), 
testifying that Bayview's records indicated TMLF had 
possession of the original blank-indorsed Note on 
June 1, 2016, the date the complaint was filed. A 
June 5, 2012 Document Transmittal Report, confirming 
TMLF's possession of the Note on June 5, 2012, supported the testimony. 
4. A declaration of Document Coordinator Keli Smith, another Bayview employee, testifying that a "Complaint 
Checklist prepared and executed by Bayview on 
April 12, 2016," two months before the complaint was 
filed, confirms that "the original Note for this loan 
4   
 
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
was in" TMLF's possession at that time. The Complaint 
Checklist was also attached as an exhibit. 
This evidence supported a finding that BONY's counsel 
physically possessed the blank-indorsed Note when BONY filed the June 1, 2016 foreclosure complaint. In other words, BONY 
established it had standing to file the complaint. 
Thus, the circuit court did not err in granting BONY's 
motion for summary judgment. 
(2) Related to standing, Collins contends the circuit 
"court gravely erred when it granted a foreclosure to an Imposter who lacked standing and authority, after eliminating 
the trial on the merits, the [summary judgment] hearing" (POE 
3). (Formatting altered.) Collins argues her right to "fair 
process" was prejudiced when the Honorable Jeanette Castagnetti 
was replaced by the Honorable Gary Chang, who "cancelled the 
trial and then cancelled the [summary judgment] hearing[.]" 
"The requirements of due process are flexible and 
depend on many factors, but there are certain fundamentals of just procedure which are the same for every type of tribunal and 
every type of proceeding." Peak Capital Grp., LLC v. Perez
, 141 
Hawaiʻi 160, 178, 407 P.3d 116, 134 (2017) (citation omitted). 
"The basic elements of procedural due process are notice and an 
opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful 
manner." Id.
 (citation omitted). Questions concerning 
5   
 
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
procedural due process are reviewed de novo. Bank of Hawaii v.
Kunimoto, 91 Hawaiʻ i 372, 387, 984 P.2d 1198, 1213 (1999). 
Collins filed a memorandum in opposition to BONY's 
motion for summary judgment. Collins also had notice of, and 
presented argument at, the initial hearing on the motion for 
summary judgment. The hearing was continued, but before the 
hearing took place, the circuit court converted the motion to a 
non-hearing motion pursuant to the authority the supreme court 
granted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
And, as discussed above, BONY demonstrated there was 
no genuine issue as to whether it had standing to file the 
complaint. Because BONY demonstrated it had standing to file the complaint and Collins's memorandum in opposition and 
argument did not show a genuine issue of material fact existed, 
the circuit court properly determined trial was no longer 
necessary. See generally Mattos, 140 
Hawaiʻi at 30, 398 P.3d at 
619. Collins moreover does not identify the evidence or assert 
the argument(s) she intended to raise at the hearing to defeat 
the summary judgment motion. 
Thus, the circuit court did not violate Collins's 
right to due process. 
(3) Collins next contends the circuit "court gravely 
erred when it sanctioned [her] regarding the meet and confer, which was a harsh and unreasonable penalty, which allowed [BONY] 
6   
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to escape having to prove standing" (POE 4). (Formatting 
altered.) 
Hawai‘i Rules of 
Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 37(a)(2) 
provides that a motion compelling discovery "must include a 
certification that the movant has in good faith conferred or 
attempted to confer with the person or party failing to make the 
discovery in an effort to secure the information or material 
without court action." To obtain an order compelling discovery 
under HRCP Rule 37(a)(2), which may subject the non-movant to 
penalties for non-compliance, the movant must first show that an 
effort was made to secure the information or material without 
court action. See
 HRCP Rule 37(a)(2), (b). We review a trial 
court's ruling on a motion to compel discovery for an abuse of 
discretion. Bank of New York Mellon v. Lemay
, 137 Hawaiʻi 30, 
33, 364 P.3d 928, 931 (App. 2015). 
Collins moved to compel discovery from BONY, which the 
circuit court denied without prejudice because Collins failed to 
"establish a satisfactory record" that she had met and conferred 
with BONY regarding the requested discovery before filing the 
motion. 
A month and a half after the circuit court denied her 
first motion to compel, Collins again moved to compel discovery from BONY, which the circuit court denied, this time with 
prejudice, because Collins "did not contact opposing counsel for plaintiff to confer or attempt to confer" regarding the 
7   
 
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
requested discovery before filing the motion and the discovery 
cutoff had closed. 
Under these circumstances, the circuit court did not 
abuse its discretion. 
(4) Finally, Collins contends the circuit "court 
gravely erred by failing to apply the 6 year" statute of 
limitation (POE 5). (Formatting altered.) Collins argues her 
"debt expired six years after acceleration" of the loan. (Formatting altered.) 
The application of the statute of limitations is 
reviewed de novo. See generally Est. of Roxas v. Marcos, 121 
Hawaiʻi 59, 66, 214 P.3d 598, 605 (2009).  In Bowler v.
Christiana Trust, a Division of Wilmington Savings Fund Society, 
FSB, 143 Hawai‘ i 235, 426 P.3d 459, No. CAAP-16-0000728, 2018 WL 
4659562, at *8 (App. Sept. 28, 2018) (mem. op.), this court held 
that the "statute of limitations on actions 'to recover 
possession of any lands, or make any entry thereon,' under HRS 
§ 657-31 [is] most analogous to a foreclosure action, as opposed 
to an action to recover a debt," thus, "a mortgagee may 
foreclose on the mortgage after the [six-year] statute of 
limitations has run on an action to recover on the underlying 
note, except that the mortgagee is not entitled to a deficiency 
judgment against the debtor."

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The "limitation period under HRS § 657-31 (2016) is 
twenty years." Bank of New York Mellon v. White, 155 Hawai‘ i 
255, 562 P.3d 176, No. CAAP-21-0000400, 2024 WL 5245129, at *1 
(App. Dec. 30, 2024) (SDO) (ruling on similar issue where 
Collins was also a party), cert. granted, No. SCWC-21-0000400. 
Thus, the circuit court did not err in applying the 
twenty-year statute of limitation. 
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the circuit court's 
March 10, 2022 Judgment.
