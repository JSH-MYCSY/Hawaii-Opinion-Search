August 31, 2022, by the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit 
(circuit court )1 . 
Upon careful review of the record, and Bordenyuk's 
brief,  we affirm the circuit court's Order and Judgment.   
Bordenyuk's brief states,  2
The Maui court did not provide an interpreter 
certified for translations in court. The translator who 
was provided translated two words out of what was said in 
five to six sentences. As a fact, by negligence or 
intentionality, the court made a mistake an d violated the 
law. The fact that the second court documents were 
presented to me for the first time during this meeting did 
not give me time to familiarize myself. The certificate of 
service law was also violated. the [sic] court 
deliberately acted in violation of rights. man [sic] 
against Olga Bordenyuk. I ask the High Court to make an 
investigation and inform the perpetrators about the non -
performing actions. In this regard, the decision of the 
court cannot be lawful as it is unfair and illegal.3 
Bordenyuk provides no discernible argument, references 
to the record on appeal, or citations to legal authority  in  
support  of  her various contentions. We decline to address the 
merits of any issues that Bordenyuk  did not  argue  on appeal. 
See  Kakinami v. Kakinami, 127 Hawaiʻi 126, 144 n.16, 276 P.3d

Procedure Rule 28 , and does not include points of error, record references, 
or citations to legal authority . Petitioner -Appellee Joseph Ramsey did not 
file an answering brief. 
3   We note that there is no transcript  in the record  of the hearing 
that Bordenyuk references. See  Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawaiʻi 225,

show error by reference to matters in the record, and he or she has the

We therefore affirm the circuit court's Order and
