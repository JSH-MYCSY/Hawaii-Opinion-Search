NO. CAAP-22-0000397 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
ESTATE OF DAVID S. DELUZ, SR.,
by and through Personal Representative, JAN K. DELUZ,
Plaintiff-Appellee, v. HAWAII TIRE CO., LLC,
a Hawaii limited liability company, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
NORTH AND SOUTH HILO DIVISION 
(CIVIL NO. 3DRC-22-0000040) 
ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL 
(By:  Leonard, Presiding Judge, McCullen and Chan, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of Plaintiff-Appellee Estate of 
David Deluz, Sr., by and through Personal Representative Jan K. 
Deluz's (
Deluz) July 6, 2022 Motion to Dismiss Appeal, the papers 
in support and in opposition, and the record, it appears that: 
(1)
 Deluz seeks dismissal of the appeal filed by 
Defendant-Appellant Hawaii Tire Co., LLC (Hawaii Tire) from the 
May 18, 2022 Order Denying Defendant Hawaii Tire Co., LLC's 
Renewed Motion to Compel Arbitration (May 18, 2022 Denial Order), 
entered in the District Court of the Third Circuit, North and 
South Hilo Division, for lack of jurisdiction;  
(2) Deluz contends that the May 18, 2022 Denial Order 
is not appealable under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 658A-
28(a) and the collateral order doctrine as an order denying a 
motion to compel arbitration; 
(3) On January 26, 2022, Hawaii Tire moved to dismiss 
the underlying complaint (Complaint) and to submit "all claims" 
in the Complaint to arbitration (Motion to Compel Arbitration).

The Complaint appears to raise two claims: (1) summary 
possession, and (2) damages related to unpaid general excise taxes (GET Issue); 
(4) On February 8, 2022, the district court ordered 
arbitration of the GET Issue and denied the Motion to Compel Arbitration as to "all other issues that [Hawaii Tire] seeks to compel arbitration" (February 8, 2022 Order) and, thus, this 
order was appealable as an order denying a motion to compel 
arbitration of all other issues raised by the Complaint;  
(5) Hawaii Tire's April 12, 2022 Renewed Motion to 
Compel Arbitration (April 12, 2022 Renewed Motion) did not raise 
a new issue of arbitrability; though labeled as a "renewed" 
motion for arbitration, it was, in substance, a motion for reconsideration, see Khaleghi v. Indymac Ventures, LLC, No. CAAP-15-0000486, 2016 WL 4268709, at *4 (App. Aug. 11, 2016) (Mem.) (noting that "it is the substance of a motion that should control rather than the title of the motion"); 
(6) Therefore, the May 18, 2022 Denial Order from which 
Hawaii Tire appeals was not an order denying a motion to compel arbitration as Hawaii Tire contends, but rather, an order denying an Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 59 motion for 
reconsideration.
1 
(7) Because Hawaii Tire did not file the notice of 
appeal within 30 days of the February 8, 2022 Order, the appeal was untimely absent an exception, Hawai# i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure ( 
HRAP) Rule 4(a)(1);  
(8) Although a timely post-judgment motion for 
reconsideration tolls the time to appeal, the motion for reconsideration must be filed within 10 days after entry of the order or judgment to be reconsidered, HRAP Rule 4(a)(3); HRCP Rule 59(e). 
1 Though not essential to our analysis here, it appears that the
District Court denied the Renewed Motion on the basis that Hawaii Tire filed 
it while litigation was stayed.  Though we decline to comment on the proprietyof this basis for denial, we nonetheless recognize that the Renewed Motion wasuntimely under HRCP Rule 59(e) as a motion for reconsideration, and it wouldhave otherwise been denied on that basis. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(9) Because Hawaii Tire filed its April 12, 2022 
Renewed Motion more than 10 days after the February 8, 2022 
Order, it did not toll the time to appeal; 
(10) Accordingly, this court lacks jurisdiction. Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Deluz's July 6, 
2022 Motion to Dismiss Appeal is granted, and this appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are 
dismissed. 
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, September 9, 2022.
