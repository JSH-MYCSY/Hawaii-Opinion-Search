Party Purchasers Lovehome Realty, LLC, Sini Zhang, and Haixin 
Tan's (collectively Proposed Intervenors) September 17, 2024 
"Stipulation for Dismissal with Prejudice of Defendants Richard 
Michael Morgenstein, Jr., and Kim's Joy Morgenstein's Notice of 
Appeal filed June 21, 2022" (Stipulation to Dismiss), and the 
Morgensteins' September 13, 2024 "Motion to Extend Deadlines in 
Order of Temporary Remand Filed on August 5, 2024" (Motion to 
Extend Deadlines), the papers in support, and the record and files herein, it appears that: 
(1) On August 5, 2024, this court entered an order in 
response to Prospective Intervenors' "Motion to Intervene and 
Dismiss Appeal as Moot" temporarily remanding the case to "the 
circuit court for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether 
Zhang is a good-faith, third-party purchaser of the Property" 
and explaining jurisdiction would revert to this court upon the 
filing of a motion to extend the temporary remand period, the 
filing of a supplemental record on appeal including the circuit court's findings of fact and conclusions of law following its 
evidentiary hearing on Zhang's status, or within sixty-three 
days from the order, whichever occurred first; 
(2) 
On September 13, 2024, the Morgensteins filed the 
Motion to Extend Deadlines pursuant to Hawai‘i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 27, asking this court to extend deadlines in the August 5, 2024 order of temporary remand to allow

additional time to seek dismissal of this appeal and the 
underlying complaint as the Morgensteins and Prospective 
Intervenors had reached a settlement; 
(3) The Motion to Extend Deadlines does not explain 
why additional time is needed to seek dismissal of the appeal 
and/or the underlying complaint; 
(4) On September 17, 2024, CSMC, the Morgensteins, 
and non-party Proposed Intervenors filed the Stipulation to Dismiss pursuant to HRAP Rule 42(b); 
a. The Stipulation to Dismiss states all parties to the appeal stipulated "the above-entitled 
appeal . . . is dismissed with prejudice"; 
b. "[E]ach party [is] to bear his or her own costs and attorneys' fees"; and 
c. The Stipulation to Dismiss is dated and signed by counsel for both appearing parties (CSMC 
and the Morgensteins) and non-party Proposed Intervenors; 
(5) The appeal was docketed on August 24, 2022; 
(6) No payment is due; 
(7) The Stipulation to Dismiss complies with HRAP 
Rule 42(b) (providing in part that if "parties to a docketed 
appeal or other proceeding sign and file a stipulation for 
dismissal, specifying the terms as to payment of costs and" pay 
3   
 
 
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the fees that are due, "the case shall be dismissed upon 
approval by the appellate court"); and 
(8) On October 7, 2024, jurisdiction automatically 
reverted to this court as sixty-three days passed since this 
court entered its order temporarily remanding the case to 
circuit court, no supplemental record on appeal was filed in the 
case, and the Motion to Extend Deadlines did not explain why 
additional time was needed to seek dismissal of the appeal and/or the underlying complaint. 
Therefore, IT IS ORDERED that the Motion to Extend 
Deadlines is denied, the Stipulation to Dismiss is approved, and 
the appeal is dismissed with prejudice. The parties shall bear 
their own attorneys' fees and costs on appeal. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are 
dismissed.
