DEXTER J. SMITH, Petitioner
-Appellant,
v.  
STATE OF HAWAI‘I, Respondent-Appellee 
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT  
(CASE NOS. 1PR161000009; 1PC121001834)  
 
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Wadsworth and Guidry, JJ)  
Self-represented Petitioner -Appellant Dexter J. Smith 
(Smith) appeals from the "Order Denying Hawai ʻi Rules of Penal 
Procedures [( HRPP)] Rule 47 Motion [( Rule 47 Motion )] and Motion 
for Appointment of Counsel" ( Order), entered on May 25, 2022 by 
the Circuit Court of the First Circuit ( circuit court). 1 
1 The Honorable Christine E. Kuriyama presided.   
 
 
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Rule 47 Motion arose from Smith's conviction for 
Kidnapping in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) §§ 707-
720(1)(d) and/or -720(1)(e)  (Supp. 2012). Smith appealed from 
his conviction, and this court affirmed. State v. Smith, 
No.  CAAP-13-0005660, 2015 WL 1070756 (Haw. App. Mar. 11, 2015)  
(SDO).  
On May 17, 2016, Smith filed his  Petition to Vacate, 
Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner from 
Custody (Petition), asserting thirteen grounds in support of his 
Petition. The circuit court dismissed the Petition, finding  
"the allegations and arguments raised by [Smith] to be without merit, patently frivolous, and without a trace of support either 
in the record or from anything submitted by [Smith]." On 
January 12, 2017, the circuit court entered a "Second Amended Order Dismissing Amended Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or 
Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner from Custody Without a 
Hearing"  (Petition Order ). Smith appealed, arguing that 
appellate counsel in his direct appeal provided ineffective assistance by  failing  to argue prosecutorial misconduct, and 
that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction. Smith  v. State, No. CAAP-17-0000068, 2019 WL 2482109, at *1 
(Haw. App. June 14, 2019). This court affirmed. Id.  at *4.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On November 29, 2021, Smith filed the Rule 47 Motion. 
Smith contended that the circuit court abused its discretion in 
dismissing the Petition , and in failing to explain its 
reasoning. The State did not file a response. On May 25, 2022, 
the circuit court denied the Rule 47 Motion, and ruled that, 
pursuant to HRPP Rule 40(a)(3), Smith's claims had already been 
ruled upon and/or waived. 
This appeal followed. On appeal, Smith appears to 
raise four points of error: (1) the circuit court erred in 
denying the Rule 47 Motion before the State could file a 
response; (2) it was plain error to deny the Rule 47 Motion 
because Smith's claims are exempt from HRPP Rule 40(a)(3); 
(3)  the Order withdrew "potentially meritorious defenses against 
any waiver" and the circuit court is the "extraordinary 
circumstances" to justify Smith's failure to raise issues in the 
Petition; and (4) the circuit court erred in denying the 
Petition without entering findings of fact  (FOF)  and conclusions 
of law  (COL).  
At the outset, we address the State's contention that 
this court lacks jurisdiction because the Order is not 
appealable. We disagree. The circuit court construed Smith's 
Rule 47 Motion as a nonconforming HRPP Rule 40 petition, and 
denied relief pursuant to HRPP Rule 40(a)(3) . The circuit court 
3   
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
found that  Smith  had  "already raised or failed to raise the 
issues" in the Petition, and did not establish "extraordinary 
circumstances justifying [his]  failure to raise the issues."   
Moreover, Smith's Rule 47 Motion states that it was made, in relevant part, pursuant to HRPP Rule 40. Smith also represented, in his reply brief, that the Rule 47 Motion is a 
nonconforming HRPP Rule 40 petition, and that Rule 33 of the 
Rules of the Circuit Courts of the State of 
Hawaiʻi allows for 
the Rule 47 Motion to be interpreted under HRPP Rule 40. Thus, 
this court construes Smith's  appeal as being taken from an 
appealable written order denying a nonconforming HRPP Rule 40 
petition. See  Grattafiori v. State, 79 Hawai ʻi 10,  13, 897 P.2d 
937, 940 (1995)  ("According to HRPP Rule 40(h), appeals from 
proceedings for post-conviction relief may be made 'from a 
judgment entered in the proceeding.'").   
We therefore consider Smith's points of error in turn. 
Upon careful review of the record , briefs, and relevant legal 
authorities , and having given due consideration to the arguments 
advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve 
Smith's points of error as follows : 
(1) The circuit court did not err by entering the 
Order without a response from the State. As explained supra, 
the circuit court properly construed the Rule 47 Motion as a 
4   
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
   
 
 
 
 
  
   
 
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
nonconforming HRPP Rule 40 petition. HRPP Rule 40(d) states 
that "the respondent may answer or otherwise plead, but the 
court may require the State to answer at any time." (Emphasis 
added.) Thus, a response from the State was not necessary. 
(2) We review de novo Smith's contention that his 
claims are exempt from HRPP Rule 40(a)(3), and are therefore not 
waived, because his conviction was invalid and his sentence was 
illegal. See Maddox v. State , 141 Hawaiʻi 196, 202, 407 P.3d 
152, 158 (2017). As discussed infra, Smith's conviction was 
valid, and his failure to raise the " [p]lain [e]rrors" in an 
ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim resulted in a 
waiver pursuant to HRPP Rule 40(a)(3). 
(3) The Order and Petition Order did not withdraw 
"potentially meritorious defenses against the waiver of the 
issues" in the Rule 47 Motion. Th is court previously ruled upon 
Smith's claim for ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, 
and therefore , further relief is not available here. Smith, 
2019 WL 2482109, at *3 —4; see HRPP Rule 40(a)(3). And Smith has 
not demonstrated the requisite "extraordinary circumstances " to 
justify his failure to raise the claim in the Petition. See 
HRPP Rule 40(a)(3). 
The circuit court's denial of the Rule 47 Motion and 
the Petition did not constitute "extraordinary circumstances ." 
5   
 
 
 
 
  
   
 
     
 
 
   
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Smith contends  that the circuit court's Petition Order  denied 
Smith "referral to another counsel pursuant to HRPP Rule 40(i),"  
thereby  preventing him from filing a supplemental petition 
pursuant to HRPP Rule 40(e)  to raise the issues that were raised 
in the Rule 47 Motion. Smith did not request counsel for the 
Petition. The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in 
these circumstances.   See  Lankford v. State, No. CAAP-19-
0000008, 2021 WL 1174584, at *1 (Haw. App. Mar. 29, 2021) (SDO) 
(citing State v. Levi, 102 Hawaiʻ i 282, 288, 75 P.3d 1173, 1179 
(2003))  (explaining that a court has discretion in appointing 
counsel in post-conviction proceedings).  2
Moreover, the Hawaiʻi Rules of Professional Conduct, 
which govern attorney conduct in Hawaiʻi, and Tagupa v. VIPDesk , 
135 Hawaiʻi 468, 353 P.3d 1010 (2015), which relates to 
attorneys' fees, do not apply here. There is no requirement 
that the Petition must have been filed with "bad faith" or 
"malicious intent" for the circuit court to conclude that it is 
"patently frivolous. " See HRPP Rule 40(i). 
The purported lack of transcripts or access to the 
"Rules of Evidence Manual" also do not constitute "extraordinary 
2 HRPP Rule 40(i) provides that the court is not required to refer 
a petition to the public defender if the claim is "patently frivolous and 
without trace of support either in the record or from other evidence 
submitted by the petitioner."

circumstances. " The courts are not required to provide 
transcripts to Smith in this case, and it is Smith's burden, as 
Appellant, to demonstrate error based on the record. 
Bettencourt v. Bettencourt , 80 Hawaiʻi 225, 230, 909 P.2d 553, 
558 (1995); State v. Murphy , 59 Haw. 1, 5 n.3, 575 P.2d 448, 452 
n.3 (1978). 
Finally, we note that the circuit court entered the 
Order after Smith filed the Rule 47 Motion, which undercuts 
Smith's assertion that the Order "withdrew potentially 
meritorious defenses against the waiver of the issues in the 
HRPP Rule 47 motion." 
Smith fails to demonstrate the "extraordinary 
circumstances " necessary to justify his failure to assert 
ineffective assistance of counsel in the Petition. We 
therefore determine that the issue was waived pursuant to HRPP 
Rule 40(a)(3). 
(4) The circuit court did not err in failing to enter 
FOF and COL with the Order. HRPP Rule 40(g) requires the 
circuit court to enter FOF and COL only if the circuit court 
does not dismiss a petition as "patently frivolous." Domingo v. 
State, 76 Hawaiʻi 237, 243, 873 P.2d 775, 781 (1994). Here, the 
Amended Order states the Rule 47 Motion was "patently frivolous 
7   
 
 
 
 
   
 
   
 
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and without a trace of support in the record. " Thus, FOF and 
COL were not necessary. 
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Order.
