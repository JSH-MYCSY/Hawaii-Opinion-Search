NO. CAAP-22-0000412 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI#I 
CHRIS CAWTHON, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
GERI ALLISON, Defendant-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 3DV19100155K) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Wadsworth and Guidry, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that self-
represented Plaintiff-Appellant Chris Cawthon (
Cawthon) appeals 
from the Divorce Decree entered May 12, 2022, in the Family Court 
of the Third Circuit. Cawthon failed to file the June 24, 2022 Notice of Appeal within thirty days after entry of the Divorce Decree, as required by Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
(HRAP) Rule 4(a)(1), and the record does not indicate that 
Cawthon received an extension of time to appeal under HRAP Rule 
4(a)(4), or that the deadline was otherwise tolled by a timely-filed post-judgment motion under HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). Accordingly, the appeal is untimely. 
See
 HRAP Rule 26(e) ("The reviewing 
court for good cause shown may relieve a party from a default occasioned by any failure to comply with these rules, except the failure to give timely notice of appeal."); Narmore v. Kawafuchi
, 
112 Hawai#i 69, 81, 143 P.3d 1271, 1283 (2006) ("The requirement 
that a party timely file a notice of appeal has been held to be jurisdictional by this court."). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are 
dismissed as moot.
