IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAIʻ I 
STATE OF HAWAIʻ I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v. 
RAYMOND EARL ARD, Defendant-Appellant. 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 5PC051000062) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and McCullen, JJ.) 
  Defendant-Appellant Raymond Earl Ard appeals from the 
Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit's June 6, 2022 "Findings of 
Fact [(FOF)]; Conclusions of Law [(COL)]; and Order Denying 
Defendant's Application for Conditional Release Filed June 21, 2021."  In his sole point of error on appeal, Ard contends the 
circuit court erred in denying his application for conditional release.

1 The Honorable Kathleen N.A. Watanabe presided.   
 
 
 
   Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve the 
point of error as discussed below, and affirm. 
  
  
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Ard, his wife, and minor step-son moved into a rental 
residence owned by Jon (Kerns
) and Claudia Kerns in Waimea, 
Kaua‘i in late 2004.  On the night of February 27, 2005, Ard 
stabbed his step-son once in the neck and stabbed Kerns multiple 
times in the chest with a three-inch paring knife. Taken to 
Kauaʻi Veterans Memorial Hospital, Kerns was pronounced dead on 
arrival; Ard's step-son survived. 
Following a bench trial in 2006, the circuit court 
found Ard guilty of Attempted Murder in the First Degree as to 
Kerns and Ard's step-son, and not guilty of Murder and Attempted 
Murder in the Second Degree. 
The circuit court acquitted Ard 
"on the ground[s] of physical or mental disease, disorder or defect, excluding responsibility," and concluded Ard presented 
"a risk of danger to himself and/or others and is not a proper 
subject for conditional release at this time." 
Hawai‘i Revised 
Statutes §§ 704-408 (1993), 704-411 (Supp. 1997). The circuit 
court committed Ard "to the custody of the Director of the 
Department of Health to be placed in an appropriate institution 
2   
 
 
 
   
 
  
 
  
  
 
  
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
for care, custody, and treatment." Ard was admitted to Hawai‘ i 
State Hospital the next day. 
Ard applied for conditional release on June 21, 2021, 
requesting the circuit court appoint a three-panel board of 
examiners to determine whether he should be granted conditional 
release, and requesting conditional release "to a 24-hour group 
home." Following a hearing, the circuit court entered its 
findings and conclusions, and denied Ard's application for 
conditional release.2 
To support his contention that the circuit court erred 
in denying his application, Ard challenges FOF 4-6, 12-27, and COL 3 and 5.
3 In doing so, Ard mainly claims that: the 
examiners' full opinions were not taken into consideration; testimony was taken out of context; and the circuit court's 
findings were misleading, incomplete, or inaccurate. 
Based on our review of the record, the circuit court 
did not clearly err as to FOF 4-6 and 12-27 because there was substantial evidence supporting these challenged findings. See
2 In 2014, this court upheld a previous denial of an application for 
Ard's conditional release. State v. Ard, 134 Hawaiʻ i 133, 337 P.3d 54, 
No. CAAP- 12-0000755, 2014 WL 5331918 at *2 (App. Oct. 20, 2014) (SDO). 
3 We note Ard cites to article I, section 5 of the Hawai‘ i Constitution 
and the fifth and fourteenth amendments of the U.S. Constitution, but does 
not raise a separate point of error asserting a constitutional violation. 
See Hawai‘i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(4) (requiring separate 
points of error and stating "[p]oints not presented in accordance with this 
section will be disregarded"). Thus, we do not further address these citations.

Dan v. State, 76 Hawai‘ i 423, 428, 879 P.2d 528, 533 (1994) ("A 
trial court's [findings of fact] are reviewed under the 'clearly 
erroneous' standard"); State v. Quiday, 141 Hawai‘ i 116, 121, 405 
P.3d 552, 557 (2017) ("A finding of fact is clearly erroneous 
when (1) the record lacks substantial evidence to support the 
finding, or (2) despite substantial evidence in support of the 
finding, the appellate court is nonetheless left with a definite 
and firm conviction that a mistake has been made") (citations 
omitted). 
Also based on our review of the record on appeal, the 
circuit court did not err in entering COL 3 and 5 because these conclusions were supported by the circuit court's findings and 
reflect the correct application of the law. See State v.
Locquiao
, 100 Hawai‘i 195, 203, 58 P.3d 1242, 1250 (2002) 
(explaining "[t]he circuit court's conclusions of law are 
reviewed under the right/wrong standard") (citations omitted);

that is supported by the trial court's findings of fact and that

overturned") (citations omitted). 
As such, we affirm the circuit court's June 6, 2022 
"Findings of Fact; Conclusions of Law; and Order Denying
