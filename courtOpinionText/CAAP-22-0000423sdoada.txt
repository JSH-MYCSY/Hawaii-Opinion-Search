 I. BACKGROUND  
This matter arises out of a lease entered into on 
June 1, 2010 (the 2010 Lease ), by lessor Valley Marketplace 
Partners, TBC's predecessor in interest, and lessee Pizzetta.   
The 2010 Lease was for a commercial space located at the Old 
Koloa Town Shopping Center where Pizzetta would operate its 
restaurant business (the Property) .  The 2010 Lease was for a 
two-year term to end on May 31, 2012, and specified that, should 
Pizzetta continue to occupy the premises after the lease term 
ended, all terms of the 2010 Lease would continue to apply.   3
 
2  The Honorable Kathleen N.A. Watanabe presided.  
 
3  The "Holding Over" provision, herein referred to a s the Holdover 
Provision, stated, 
 
If Lessee shall remain in possession of and occupy 
the Premises after the expiration of the term of this Lease 
without a written agreement with Lessor setting forth the 
terms and provisions of a new Lease or an extension of this 
Lease, all term s, covenants and agreements hereof shall 
continue to apply and bind the Lessee as long as Lessee 
remains in possession, except that the guaranteed minimum 
rental shall be two (2) times the amount of guaranteed 
minimum rental and percentage rental, if applicable, 
payable for the last month of the term of this Lease, 
prorated on a daily basis for each day that Lessee remains 
in possession.  
 
 
(continued . . .)  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 Halter, as Vice President of Pizzetta, and Shyne, as President 
of Pizzetta, executed a Guaranty of the 2010 Lease (the 2010 
Guaranty) .  The 2010 Guaranty was incorporated into the 2010 
Lease as "Exhibit ' G'." 4
Pizzetta continued to occupy the Property after its 
lease term expired on May 31, 2012.  On June 6, 2018, TBC and 
Pizzetta agreed to a "[f ]irst [a]mendment of [the 2010] Lease" 
(the 2018 Amendment ) to, inter alia , extend the lease term and 
increase the guaranteed minimum.  Pizzetta fell behind on its 
rental payments by January 1, 2020.  
It appears that TBC and Pizzetta entered into a 
"workout" agreement (the Workout Agreement ) in June 2020.  
Pursuant to the Workout A greement,  
• The total current outstanding rent balance as of 
June 9, 2020 is $138,653.04 (  covers thru June 30th, 2020)  
[sic]. 
 
 
3(. . . continued)  
If Lessee shall, at the expiration or other 
termination of this Lease, fail to yield up possession to 
Lessor, Lessor shall have the option to require Lessee to 
pay and Lessee shall pay as liquidated damages for each day 
possession is withheld, [an] amount equal to TWICE the 
amount of the guaranteed minimum rental and percentage 
rental computed on the thirty -day (30) month basis.  
 
4  Exhibit "G" was incorporated into the 2010 Lease pursuant to the  
"Entire Agreement" provision, which provided that , 
 
This Agreement and any and all Exhibits hereto 
constitutes the entire agreement of Lessor and Lessee and 
supersedes all oral and written agreements and 
understanding made and entered into by the parties hereto 
prior to the date hereof.  All Exhibits attached to  this 
Agreement are specifically incorporated herein and made a 
part of this Agreement.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 • [Pizzetta] agrees to make a rent payment of $60,000 
via wire transfer prior to end of day on Friday June 12; in 
exchange for [Pizzetta's] payment [Pizzetta] will receive a 
rent credit of an additional $60,000 toward the outstanding 
balance. So the new outstanding rent balance will be 
$18,653 and this amount will be Deferred Rent.  
 
• If [Pizzetta] pays the July and August base rent on 
time, [TBC] will then waive the September and October base 
rent; the CAM will be added to the Deferred Rent balance.  
Alternatively, [Pizzetta] may elect to defer the base rent 
and CAM in which case this will be added to the Deferred 
Rent balance.  
• [Pizzetta] will resume rent payments per the lease 
schedule in November of 2020, provided [Pizzetta] and [TBC] 
agree to assess the situation in November.  
• The Deferred Rent balance outlined above will be paid 
back starting July 1, 2021 over 24 months.   
 
 
It further appears that Pizzetta failed to comply with 
the terms of the Workout Agreement by not "resum[ing] rent 
payments per the lease schedule in November of 2020. "  Per the 
2010 Lease, rent payment was due "in advance on  the first day of 
each calendar month[ .]"  On November 4, 2020, TBC sent a default 
notice to Defendants, demanding that Defendants cure their 
monetary defaults by December 4, 2020.  Defendants failed to 
cure their defaults by this deadline.  
In January 2021, Halter executed an Affidavit of 
Abandonment and Return of Possession.  TBC filed its Complaint 
against the Defendants in March 2021, alleging one count of 
breach of contract on the ground that Defendants "fail[ed] to 
pay rent, late charges, and interest due and owing under the 
[2010 Lease] and [2018 Amendment]. "  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 In May 2021, TBC entered into an agreement to lease the 
Property to a new tenant, Koloa Pizza Kitchen + Bar LLC (Koloa 
Pizza).  Koloa Pizza's rental obligations began on September 17, 
2021. 
TBC filed its Motion for Summary Judgment in December 
2021, contending that there was no genuine issue of material 
fact that Pizzetta's "failure to pay timely rent and abandonment 
of the [p ]remises" constitutes a breach of contract.  Defendants 
opposed the motion.  The circuit court heard the motion in 
February 2022. 
The circuit court granted TBC's Motion for Summary 
Judgment, and awarded TBC attorneys ' fees and costs .  This 
appeal followed. 
II. POINTS OF ERROR  
Defendants raise three points of error on appeal, 
contending that the circuit court erred in : (1) granting TBC's 
Motion for Summary Judgment; (2) denying Defendants' Motion for 
Reconsideration of TBC's Motion for Summary Judgment; and (3) 
granting TBC's Motion for Attorneys' Fees and Costs.  
Upon careful review of the record and relevant legal 
authorities, and having given due consideration to the arguments 
advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve the 
Defendants' contentions as follows : NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
6 
 (1) We review the circuit c ourt's grant of summary 
judgment de novo, applying the following standard,  
Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, 
depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on 
file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there 
is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the 
moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. A 
fact is material if proof of that fact would have the 
effect of establishing or refuting one of the essential 
elements of a cause of action or defense asserted by the 
parties. The evidence must be viewed in the light most 
favorable to the non -moving party. In other words, we must 
view all of the evidence and inferences drawn therefrom in 
the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.  
 
Ralston v. Yim, 129 Hawaiʻi 46, 55—56, 292 P.3d 1276, 1285—86 
(2013) (cleaned up).    
We conclude that TBC satisfied its initial burden on 
summary judgment by providing evidence, in the form of a 
declaration from TBC's manager, Cory Beall, and attached 
exhibits, that there were no disputed issues of material fact 
regarding Defendants' breach of contract and its entitlement to 
unpaid back rent.  See id. at 60, 292 P.3d at 1290 ("[A] summary 
judgment movant may satisfy his or her initial burden of 
production by either (1) presenting evidence negating an element 
of the non-movant's claim, or (2) demonstrating that the 
nonmovant will be unable to carry his or her burden of proof at 
trial.") (citations omitted).   
The summary judgment record reflects that Pizzetta 
continued to occupy the Property and pay monthly rent after the 
initial lease term expired in 2012 .  Pursuant to the Holdover NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
7 
 Provision, the terms of the 2010 Lease continued to apply.   TBC 
and Pizzetta subsequently entered into the 2018 Amendment - the 
"[f]irst [a]mendment of [the 2010] Lease" – which represented 
that "[TBC]  and [Pizzetta] are the current landlord and tenant 
under [the 2010 Lease], originally between Valley Marketplace 
Partners . . . as landlord, and [Pizzetta], as tenant[. ]"  The 
2010 Guaranty  signed by Halter and Shyne, which was part of the 
2010 Lease, remained in effect both during the post- May 2012 
holdover period and after the 2018 Amendment was executed.  
Pizzetta stopped paying its rent by January 2020, and 
after Pizzetta's continued failure to pay rent pursuant to the 
Workout Agreement, TBC issued a notice of default to Defendants 
in November 2020.  Pizzetta did not pay its back rent balance, 
and transmitted to TBC an Affidavit of Abandonment and Return of 
Possession.  
Following Pizzetta's abandonment of the Property in 
January 2021, TBC engaged in mitigation efforts to find a new 
lessee by issuing intent letters to two potential lessees and 
then entering into a new lease with Koloa Pizza in May 2021.  
See Tabieros v. Clark Equip. Co., 85  Hawaiʻi 336, 393, 944 P.2d 
1279, 1336  (1997) ("[P]laintiffs are subject to a duty to 
mitigate damages in either contract or tort.").   
The burden then shifted to Defendants.  Although 
Defendants contend that they established a genuine question of NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
8 
 material fact as to whether TBC breached the W orkout Agreement, 
whether TBC sufficiently proved its mitigation efforts, whether 
the 2010 Lease and 2010 Guaranty had expired such that Halter 
and Shyne had no liability as guarantor s pursuant to the 2018 
Amendment, and as to the amount of damages, the ir declarations 
and exhibits do not support these contentions.   See Nozawa v. 
Operating Eng'rs Loc. Union No. 3, 142 Hawai ʻi 331, 342, 418 P.3d
1187, 1198 (2018) ("Once a summary judgment movant has satisfied
its initial burden of producing support for its claim that there
is no genuine issue of material fact, the party opposing summary
judgment must demonstrate specific facts, as opposed to general 
allegations, that present a genuine issue worthy of trial.") 
(cleaned up).  
 
 
 
We conclude that the c ircuit court was  not wrong in 
granting TBC's Motion for Summary Judgment.   
(2) Defendants contend that the circuit court erred in 
denying their Motion for Reconsideration.  We review a "trial 
court's ruling on a motion for reconsideration under the abuse 
of discretion standard."  Kaleikini v. Yoshioka, 128  Hawaiʻi 53, 
68, 283 P.3d 60, 75 (2012) (cleaned up).  "The purpose of a 
motion for reconsideration is to allow the parties to present 
new evidence and/or arguments that could not have been presented 
during the earlier adjudicated motion."  Kamaka v. Goodsill 
Anderson Quinn & Stifel, 117 Hawaiʻ i 92, 104, 176 P.3d 91, 103 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
(2008) (cleaned up).  It is not meant to be "a device to 
relitigate old matters or to raise arguments or evidence that 
could and should have been brought during the earlier 
proceeding."  Id.  (citation omitted)

 Although Defendants contend that "[n ]ew [e]vidence 
[w]as [i]ntroduced after the [s ]ummary [j] udgment [ h]earing," 
Defendants' opening brief does not set forth this newly 
discovered evidence, or explain why reconsideration was 
warranted in light of this "new evidence."   It appears, from the 
record5 and Defendants' appellate briefs, that Defendants' Motion 
for Reconsideration was an attempt  to relitigate, on the 
existing record, the same issues raised in Defendants' Motion 
for Summary Judgment.  We conclude that the c ircuit court did 
not abuse its discretion in denying Defendants'  Motion for 
Reconsideration.   
(3) Defendants contend that the circuit court erred in
awarding TBC's  attorneys'  fees and costs, on the ground that 
"[i]f it is found that TBC is not the prevailing party, the  
 
5  Defendants' Motion for Reconsideration attached purported "new 
evidence" in the form of declarations by Halter, Tricia Ruiz, Mark Ruiz, and 
Allan Beall.  Tricia and Mark Ruiz both stated that they are owners of Kiawe 
Roots LLC, a restaurant on Kauai, and that they viewed the Property in 
February 2021 and then "quickly declined" further discussion regarding a 
lease.  Beall stated that, while negotiating a "new lease" with Pizzetta in 
2012, "[t] here were no discussions of a Guaranty [.]"  We conclude that these 
declarations "could and should have been brought during the earlier 
proceeding[,] " and that, even if they were brought during the earlier 
proceeding, they do not demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact.  See 
Kamaka, 117 Hawaiʻ i at 104, 176 P.3d at 103  (citation omitted).  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
 
award of attorneys' fees and costs should also be reversed."  In 
light of our decision to affirm the summary judgment in favor of 
TBC, as explained supra in sections (1) and (2), TBC is the 
prevailing party,  and we affirm the award of attorneys' fees and 
costs.

 III. CONCLUSION  
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm  the circuit 
court's Summary Judgment Order, Reconsideration Order, Fees 
Order, and Judgment.
