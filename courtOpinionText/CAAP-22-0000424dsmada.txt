NO. CAAP-22-0000424 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
IN THE MATTER OF MAXIMO P. ESTEBAN TRUST DATED MAY 20, 1993  
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(TRUST NO. 1TR121000204) 
ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR DISMISSAL 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Wadsworth and Nakasone, JJ.) 
Upon review of Petitioner/Successor Trustee of the 
MAXIMO P. ESTEBAN TRUST DATED MAY 20, 1993/Attorney-Appellee Gary 
Y.
 Shigemura's September 14, 2022 "Motion to Strike Notice of 
Appeal Filed July 2, 2022 Appealing a Portion of the Circuit 
Court's Minute Order ROA DKT #875 MORD as Set Forth in Appellee's Statement Contesting Jurisdiction in Civil Appeal Docketing Statement ROA DKT 928 CA" (Motion), which we construe as a motion 
to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, the papers in 
support, the record, and there being no opposition, it appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction over Respondent-Appellant Veronica Esteban's appeal from the Circuit Court of the First Circuit's (circuit court) June 3, 2022 "Minute Order Re: Petition 
to Sell 3007 Numana Road, Honolulu, Hawaii 96819, Filed on March 
9, 2022" (Minute Order), because the circuit court has not 
entered a final appealable order or judgment, and the Minute 
Order is not independently appealable. 
Pursuant to Hawai# i Probate Rules (HPR) Rule 34, 
appeals from proceedings arising under Hawai# i Revised Statutes 
(HRS) Chapter 560 (Uniform Probate Code) are permitted only from: NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
a final judgment concluding the proceeding; an order that does 
not finally end the proceeding, but is certified for appeal in the manner provided by Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) 
Rule 54(b); or an order certified for interlocutory appeal in accordance with HRS ยง 641-1(b). 
Here, the circuit court has not entered a final 
judgment, and it has not certified the Minute Order for appeal under HRCP Rule 54(b) or HRS ยง 641-1(b). Therefore, the Minute Order is not appealable under HPR Rule 34. 
Further, the Minute Order is not independently 
appealable under the collateral-order doctrine or the Forgay
1 
doctrine, as it does not, respectively, resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action or execute against an interest in real property. See Greer v. 
Baker, 137 Hawai# i 249, 253, 369 P.3d 832, 836 (2016) (reciting 
the requirements for appeals under the collateral-order doctrine and the Forgay doctrine). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is 
granted, and the appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, October 4, 2022.
