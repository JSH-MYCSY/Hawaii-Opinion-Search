APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 1CC141002485) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Wadsworth and Chan, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of the Circuit Court of the First 
Circuit's (
Circuit Court) December 15, 2022 "Order Explaining Why 
it Is not Possible or Appropriate for this Court to Enter a Final 
Appealable Order or Judgment," and the record, it appears we lack appellate jurisdiction over Defendant/Cross-Claim Plaintiff-Appellant Shichinin LLC's (Shichinin) appeal from the Circuit 
Court's April 1, 2022 "Order Denying [Shichinin's] Motion to 
Vacate Arbitration Award and Ex Parte Motions for Issuance of Commission to Take Out-of-state Depositions Without Prejudice" and June 30, 2022 "Order Denying Shichinin, LLC's Motion to Confirm Arbitration Award, Filed April 4, 2022 Without Prejudice" entered in Civil No. 1CC141002485, because the Circuit Court has NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
not entered a final, appealable order or judgment under Hawaii 
Revised Statutes ยง 658A-28(a) (2016), and the Circuit Court has indicated it is not possible or appropriate for the Circuit Court to do so at this time. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions 
are dismissed as moot.
