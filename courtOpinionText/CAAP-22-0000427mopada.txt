APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(FC-S NO. 16-00249) 
 
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION 
(By:  Leonard, Presiding Judge, McCullen and Chan, JJ.) 
Respondent-Appellant Father appeals from the Family 
Court of the First Circuit's June 24, 2022 order denying his 
motion for reconsideration.1  On appeal, Father alleges that the 
family court violated his due process rights.2  Based on the 
 
1  The Honorable Andrew T. Park presided. 
 
2  Father also contends that the family court committed structural error 
by failing to appoint counsel for the unknown natural father.  See In re JH, 
152 Hawai‘ i 373, 380, 526 P.3d 350, 357 (2023 ) (clarifying that the family 
court may discharge court- appointed counsel when a parent inexcusably fails 
to appear in court, stating that, absent a client, "what's an attorney to 
do?").  Based on our decision in this case, we need not address this issue. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

   discussion below, we affirm the family court's denial of 
Father's motion for reconsideration for lack of jurisdiction. 
I. BACKGROUND 
A. Termination Of Parental Rights 
In November 2016, Mother gave birth to AA and 
requested he be placed in foster care.  Upon discharge from the 
hospital, Petitioner-Appellee Department of Human Services (DHS) 
placed AA with Intervenors-Appellees resource caregivers (Caregivers). 
  On December 7, 2016, DHS filed a petition for 
temporary foster custody of AA and initiated the underlying case 
(Underlying Case).  AA entered foster care in December 2016; AA 
was less than a month old.  About a month later, the family 
court appointed Court Appointed Special Advocates Program (CASA) 
as AA's guardian ad litem. 
  Mother failed to provide DHS with sufficient 
information to identify or locate the then-unknown natural father of AA.  As a result, the family court permitted service 
upon unknown natural father by publication.  Following service 
by publication, DHS moved to terminate Mother's and unknown 
natural father's parental rights. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 On February 27, 2018, the family court terminated 
Mother's and unknown natural father's parental rights.  
B. First Motion To Intervene And Appeal  
  On October 23, 2018, DHS filed a motion for immediate 
review, explaining that Father contacted DHS claiming to be AA's 
biological father and that AA was in the process of being 
adopted by Caregivers.  A genetic test confirmed that Father was 
the biological father of AA.   On February 11, 2019, Father moved to intervene 
(Father's Motion to Intervene); AA was a little over two years 
old.

The family court granted the motion, but later set 
aside that order because Father was still in default.  The 
family court denied Father's motion to set aside the default, 
and Father appealed.  This court explained that Father could not 
proceed with a motion to intervene until his default was set 
aside.  In re AA, 148 Hawai‘ i 278, 472 P.3d 1123, No. CAAP-19-
0000711, 2020 WL 5796177 at *13 (App. Sept. 29, 2020) (mem.). 
    Supreme Court held On certiorari review, the Hawai‘i
that the family court should have analyzed Father's motion to 
intervene under Hawai
‘i Family Cou
rt Rules (HFCR) Rule 24 without
requiring him first to set aside the default judgment, and

intervene.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 remanded the case for further proceedings.  In re AA, 150 Hawai‘ i
270, 284-89, 500 P.3d 455, 469-74 (2021).  The supreme court, 
however, upheld the family court's (1) service of Father via 
publication and (2) denial of Father's request to set aside default and termination of Father's parental rights by default. 
150 Hawai‘ i
 at 284-89, 500 P.3d at 469-74.  
 
C. Renewed Motion To Intervene 
  On February 17, 2022, Father again moved to intervene 
(Renewed Motion to Intervene
); AA was a little over five years 
old. 
Father argued that he met the standards set forth in 
HFCR Rule 24(a)(2) for mandatory intervention and HFCR Rule 24(b)(1) for permissive intervention.  Father relied on In 
re Doe, 109 Hawai‘ i 399, 126 P.3d 1086 (2006) and Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS) § 587A-33(d) (2018).4 
  On March 14, 2022, the family court heard and orally 
denied Father's Renewed Motion to Intervene.   On March 22, 2022, the family court granted AA's 
adoption to Caregivers. 
 
4  HRS § 587A- 33(d) provides: "A family member may be permitted 
visitation with the child at the discretion of the permanent custodian.  The 
court may review the exercise of such discretion and may order that a family 
member be permitted such visitation as is in the best interests of the 
child." NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

     On April 25, 2022, the family court entered the order 
denying Father's Renewed Motion to Intervene. 
On April 27, 2022, the family court revoked DHS's 
permanent custody and terminated its jurisdiction over the case 
in light of AA's adoption. 
  On May 5, 2022, Father moved for reconsideration of 
the denial of his Renewed Motion to Intervene (Motion for 
Reconsideration). 
On June 7, 2022, the family court denied Father's 
Motion for Reconsideration explaining that it lacked jurisdiction over the case, and even if it had jurisdiction, 
Father presented no new argument:   
Having taken judicial notice of the records, file, 
and proceeding herein; having had the chance now in 
addition to the pleadings filed respectively by movant, 
CASA, and the [Caregivers] on May 5, 16th, and 25th; and now having had opportunity to hear and consider additional 
oral argument, for reasons contained in the two opposition 
memoranda filed by the CASA program and the [Caregivers], 
as joined by [DHS], the Court respectfully denies the 
motion for reconsideration filed by [Father]. 
 
As an additional factor, as was pointed out in the 
CASA's memorandum, this Court did terminate its own 
jurisdiction of the case upon the granting of the adoption, 
which I suppose is the first hurdle.  Even if this Court could have granted the reconsideration based on some 
vestigial or lingering jurisdiction that it had, the Court 
finds that there's no new argument or point of law 
presented in the reconsideration motion and that the Court 
did in fact correctly apply the law at the initial hearing on the motion filed by [Father] that . . .  reconsideration 
was sought for, I should say.
 
 
On June 24, 2022, the family court entered the Order Denying the 
Motion for Reconsideration.  Father timely appealed. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 II. STANDARD OF REVIEW 
"It is axiomatic that mootness is an issue of subject 
matter jurisdiction.  Whether a court possesses subject matter 
jurisdiction is a question of law reviewable de novo."  Hamilton 
ex rel. Lethem v. Lethem, 119 Hawai‘ i 1, 4-5, 193 P.3d 839, 842-
43 (2008) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting 
Kaho‘ohanohano v. Dep't of Hum. Servs., 117 Hawai‘ i 262, 281, 178 
P.3d 538, 557 (2008)). 
  "When reviewing a case where the circuit court lacked 
subject matter jurisdiction, the appellate court retains 
jurisdiction, not on the merits, but for the purpose of 
correcting the error in jurisdiction."  Kaaukai v. Cnty. of 
Maui, 126 Hawai‘ i 124, 267 P.3d 708, No. 29387, 2012 WL 149871 at 
*5 (App. Jan. 18, 2012) (SDO) (brackets omitted) (quoting Koga 
Eng'g & Constr., Inc. v. State, 122 Hawai‘ i 60, 84, 222 P.3d 979, 
1003 (2010)). 
III. DISCUSSION 
In his points of error, Father focuses on the denial 
of his Renewed Motion to Intervene (as opposed to the denial of his Motion for Reconsideration), contending that the family court violated his due process rights.  As he did below, Father 
argues that he met the requirements for mandatory intervention NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 under HFCR Rule 24(a)(2) and permissive intervention under HFCR 
Rule 24(b)(1). 
In his Renewed Motion to Intervene, Father requested 
"an assessment of Father for reunification/visitation with the 
minor child and notification to all interested parties in 
preserving Father's rights in all cases." 
But reunification was not at issue.  By declining to 
set aside Father's default and termination of parental rights by 
default, the Hawai‘ i Supreme Court's decision in In re AA 
affirmed the family court's termination of Mother's and Father's 
parental rights to AA and award of permanent custody of AA to 
DHS.  See In re AA, 150 Hawai‘ i at 285-86, 500 P.3d at 470-71.  
In other words, In re AA ended Father's legal challenges to the 
family court's termination of parental rights and cleared the 
path for Caregivers to adopt AA.  HRS § 578-2(c)(1)(K) (2018) 
(providing that an adoption may occur without the consent of 
"[a] parent whose parental and custodial duties and rights have 
been divested by an award of permanent custody pursuant to 
section 587A-33").   
Father's remaining right was visitation with AA under 
HRS § 587A-33(d).  But, for purposes of this appeal, even if 
Father's Renewed Motion to Intervene met the requirements of 
HFCR 24(a)(2) or (b)(1), AA's adoption about two months later extinguished Father's residual interest in visitation.  In re NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
8 
   Doe, 109 Hawai‘ i at 410, 126 P.3d at 1097 (explaining that "such 
[HRS § 587A-33(d)] rights and interests terminate on the 
condition the children are adopted or reach the age of 
eighteen").   
Thus, any challenge to the family court's denial of 
Father's Renewed Motion to Intervene was rendered moot upon AA's adoption.     
As for the denial of Father's Motion for 
Reconsideration, AA's adoption 45 days earlier terminated the 
family court's jurisdiction over the Underlying Case because AA 
was no longer subject to harm.  HRS § 587A-5 (2018) (providing that a family court has jurisdiction over any child found within 
the State of Hawai‘ i that "is subject to imminent harm, has been 
harmed, or is subject to threatened harm by the acts or 
omissions of the child's family"); HRS § 587A-4 (2018) (defining 
family, in relevant part, as the legal parent of a child); HRS 
§ 578-16(b) (2018) (providing in relevant part that "[t]he 
former legal parent or parents of an adopted individual and any 
other former legal kindred shall not be considered to be related 
to the individual").  The family court recognized this and 
entered an order terminating the Underlying Case on April 27, 
2022. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 Thus, the family court had no jurisdiction over 
Father's May 5, 2022 Motion for Reconsideration. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
Therefore, we affirm the family court's June 24, 2022 
order denying Father's Motion for Reconsideration for lack of 
jurisdiction.
