IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI#I 
PRINCE NI#I LOA MOE-KAPU KAMEHAMEHA, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
LEONA ROCHA WILSON, Respondent-Appellee. 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
WAILUKU DIVISION 
(CASE NO. 2DSS-22-0000159) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka and Nakasone, JJ.) 
Self-represented Petitioner-Appellant Prince Ni#i Loa 
Moe-Kapu Kamehameha (Kamehameha) appeals from the Denied Petition 
for Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order and for Injunction 
Against Harassment [(Petition for TRO)] entered on June 9, 2022 
(Order Denying Petition), by the Wailuki Division of the District Court of the Second Circuit (District Court).
1 
Kamehameha raises a single point of error on appeal, 
contending that the District Court lacked jurisdiction. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
1 The Honorable Christopher M. Dunn presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve 
Kamehameha's point of error as follows: 
Kamehameha appears to argue that the State of Hawai# i 
does not have jurisdiction over him or over land in 
Hawai#i 
because the Kingdom of Hawai# i is a sovereign state. 
We conclude that the District Court had jurisdiction 
over Kamehameha and the Petition for TRO, which he filed. See 
State v. Kaulia, 128 Hawai# i 479, 487, 291 P.3d 377, 385 (2013). 
Kamehameha makes no cogent argument that the District 
Court erred in entering the Order Denying Petition. 
Accordingly, the District Court's June 9, 2022 Order 
Denying Petition is affirmed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, January 15, 2025.
