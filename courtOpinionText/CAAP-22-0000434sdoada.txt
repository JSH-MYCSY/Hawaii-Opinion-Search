Center f/k/a St. Francis Hospital, Inc. (St. Francis) and 
Plaintiff-Appellee Student Doe 30  (Plaintiff ).   Kamehameha 
Schools appeal from the Order, filed  on June 17, 2022, by the 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit ( circuit court).    32
Kamehameha Schools raises a single  point of error on 
appeal, contending that the circuit court erred in concluding 
that, under HRS § 663-15.5  (2016), the good faith settlement 
between Plaintiff and St. Francis bars Kamehameha Schools' 
third-party claims  for breach of contract, negligence, 
indemnification, and attorneys' fees pursuant to Uyemura v. Wick, 57 Haw. 102, 551 P.2d 171 (1976). We review the circuit 
court's conclusions of law de novo, under the right/wrong 
2 Plaintiff sued Defendants/Third -Party Plaintiffs/Counterclaim 
Defendants -Appellants Trustees of the Estate of Bernice Pauahi Bishop, dba 
Kamehameha Schools ( Kamehameha Schools ) pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes 
(HRS) § 657-1.8 (2016). Section 657 -1.8 permits certain actions "for 
recovery of damages based on physical, psychological, or other injury or 
condition suffered by a minor arising from the sexual abuse of the minor by 
any person" that would otherwise be time -barred. Plaintiff identified Dr. 
Robert McCormick Browne ( Dr. Browne ), formerly employed as Chief of 
Psychiatry at St. Francis, as having sexually abused him when he was a 
student at Kamehameha Schools. 
Kamehameha Schools filed a third -party complaint against St. 
Francis. St. Francis filed its answer and a counterclaim. Kamehameha 
Schools then filed a third -party complaint against Dr. Browne's Estate. Dr. 
Browne is deceased, and his Estate is a nominal Third -Party Defendant -
Appellee in this appeal. 
Plaintiff entered into separate settlement agreements with both 
St. Francis and Kamehameha Schools. Only the "Order Granting Third -Party 
Defendant St. Francis Medical Center's Petition for Determination of Good 
Faith Settlement, and Joinder Thereto " (Order), is before this court on 
appeal.

standard. State v. Hoshijo ex rel. White, 102  Hawaiʻi 307, 316, 
76 P.3d 550, 559 (2003).  
Upon careful review of the record and relevant legal 
authorities , and having given due consideration to the arguments 
advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve 
Kamehameha Schools ' contention as follows . 
HRS § 663 -15.5, entitled "Release; joint tortfeasors; 
co-obligors; good faith settlement" provides, in pertinent part, 
(d) A determination by the court that a settlement 
was made in good faith shall: 
(1) Bar any other joint tortfeasor . . . from any 
further claims against the settling tortfeasor 
. . . except those based on a written indemnity 
agreement; and 
(2) Result in a dismissal of all cross -claims filed 
against the settling joint tortfeasor . . . 
except those based on a written indemnity 
agreement. 
Contrary to Kamehameha Schools' contention, the 
circuit court did not authorize the dismissal of "claims based 
on independent duties owed by [St. Francis] to [Kamehameha 
Schools]" existing " independently of the Plaintiff 's tort 
claims[.]" The circuit court 's Order explained, 
2. The Court specifically determines that the 
settlement agreement entered into by and between St. 
Francis Medical Center and Plaintiff was made in good faith 
pursuant to Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes ( "HRS") Section 663 -
15.5. 
3. As such, St. Francis Medical Center is hereby 
discharged from any and all liability for any contribution 
to any other party, joint tortfeasor and/or co -obligor 
pursuant to HRS Section 663 -15.5(a)(3); all cross -claims 
and third party claims now pending agai nst St. Francis 
Medical Center, except those based on a written indemnity

agreement, are hereby dismissed pursuant to HRS Section 
663-15.5(d)(2); and, pursuant to HRS Section 663 -15.5(d)(1) 
this Order bars any other joint tortfeasor or co -obligor 
from bringing any further claims against St. Francis 
Medical Center in connection w ith this litigation, except 
those based upon a written indemnity agreement. 
(Emphasis added.) 
As this court recently recognized in Abad v. Griffith , 
Reading all parts of HRS § 663 -15.5 together, we conclude 
the trial court's approval of a good faith settlement under 
HRS § 663-15.5(d)(2) requires dismissal of only those 
crossclaims against a settling joint tortfeasor raised in 
the capacity of a joint tortfeasor, i.e., those seeking 
contribution or indemnity (directly or indirectly) for the 
injury (to the complainant) that is the subject of the good 
faith settlement. 
[W]e examine, for this limited purpose, the nature of the 
[appellants'] claims against the [settling join t 
tortfeasors], i.e., to consider whether they seek 
contribution or indemnity for the original injury to 
[appellees], as opposed to relief for alleged direct 
injuries to the [ appellants]. 
Abad v. Griffith, Nos. CAAP-21-0000120, CAAP-23-0000015, 2024 WL 
5088457, at *5 (Haw. App. Dec. 12, 2024) (SDO).  
In Abad, this court examined the nature of the 
appellants' claims, including the nature of the relief 
requested, and concluded that the appellants made "separate, 
unqualified requests for attorneys' fees and costs that are not tied to the [appellants'] liability to the [appellees]."   Id.  
Here, Kamehameha Schools' third-party claims  against St. Francis 
arose out of the "original injury" to Plaintiff caused by Dr. 
Browne's abuse,  and are "directly or indirectly" in the nature 
of contribution and indemnity claims.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Thus, the circuit court's dismissal of Kamehameha 
Schools' third -party complaint against St. Francis, and its 
discharg e of St. Francis "from any and all liability for any 
contribution to any other party, joint tortfeasor and/or co -
obligor," is consistent with the underlying purpose of HRS 
§ 663-15.5 of protecting settling tortfeasors from contribution 
claims brought by nonsettling alleged joint tortfeasors. We 
therefore determine that the circuit court's conclusion barring 
the third -party claims was correc t. 
For the foregoing reasons, the circuit court's Order 
is affirmed.
