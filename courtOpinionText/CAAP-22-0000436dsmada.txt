IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI#I  
DOUGLAS HIRANO, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
KATE McCLORY; SAND ISLAND TREATMENT CENTER; AT&T WIRELESS;
RANDY COOK; HOLIDAY INN HOTEL; WHITE SANDS HOTEL;
SAND VILLA HOTEL; COCONUT WAIKIKI HOTEL; OHANA MALIA HOTEL,
Defendants-Appellees, and

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 1CCV-21-0001124) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Nakasone and Chan, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that self-
represented Plaintiff-Appellant Douglas Hirano appeals from the 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit's (circuit court) May 18, 2022 
"Order Granting Defendant AT&T Mobility LLC's (erroneously 
identified as AT&T Wireless) Motion for Summary Judgment as to all Claims" (5/18/22 Order). 
The court lacks jurisdiction over the appeal because 
the circuit court has not entered a final, appealable order or judgment. 
See
 Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-1(a) (2016); 
Hawai#i Rules of Civil Procedure Rules 54(b), 58; 
Jenkins v. 
Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright
, 76 Hawai#i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 
1334, 1338 (1994). Further, the 5/18/22 Order is not independently appealable under the collateral-order doctrine, the 
Forgay1 doctrine, or HRS ยง 641-1(b). See Greer v. Baker, 137 
1 Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawai#i 249, 253, 369 P.3d 832, 836 (2016) (setting forth the 
requirements for appealability under the collateral-order 
doctrine and the 
Forgay doctrine); HRS ยง 641-1(b) (specifying 
requirements for leave to file interlocutory appeal). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
