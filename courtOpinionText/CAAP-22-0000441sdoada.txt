Final Judgment  for Gary S. Suganuma,2 in his official capacity as 
Director of Taxation, and the State of Hawai #i Department of 
Taxation (together, DOTax
), entered by the Circuit Court of the 
First Circuit.3 Booking.com challenges the circuit court's 
June 13, 2022 "Order Granting Defendants . . . Motion to Dismiss 
Complaint." We affirm. 
Booking.com sued DOTax on January 18, 2019. The 
complaint alleged: Booking.com is headquartered in Amsterdam, 
1 B.V. stands for besloten vennootschap ; it means private limited 
company in Dutch.

the Netherlands; it operates a website on which travelers can 
make reservations for transient accommodations and travel-related services; it receives a predetermined per-reservation commission from the lodging and service providers; Hawaii Administrative Rules (HAR) § 18-237-29.53-10(a)(3)
4 imposed tax on electronic 
commerce in a discriminatory manner, subjecting online merchants to taxation that is not imposed on brick-and-mortar merchants solely because the transient accommodations or travel-related bookings are "sold, purchased, or arranged" online. Booking.com 
sought a declaration under Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 91-7 
that HAR § 18-237-29.53-10(a)(3) was invalid and void. 
On November 10, 2021, DOTax issued a Notice of Final 
Assessment of General Excise and/or Use Tax to Booking.com for calendar years 2010 through 2020 totaling $19,737,315.28. Booking.com filed an appeal in the Tax Appeal Court on December 9, 2021. Judiciary Information Management Systems No. 1CTX-21-0001613. We take judicial notice under Rule 201, Hawaii Rules of Evidence, Chapter 626 HRS (2016), that the tax appeal is set for trial the week of June 15, 2026. 
The State moved to dismiss the complaint below on 
March 14, 2022. The motion was heard on May 10, 2022. The circuit court entered an order granting the motion on June 13, 2022. This appeal followed. The Final Judgment was entered on January 24, 2023, after a temporary remand. 
4 HAR § 18-237-29.53-10 (2018) provides, in relevant part: 
(a) Except as provided in section 18-237-29.53-04
[("Services related to real property")], services performed
by a commissioned agent are used or consumed where the agentis located at the time the agent's services are performed;provided that: 
. . . . 
(3) when transient accommodations or travel-related 
bookings are sold, purchased, or arranged onlinethrough a commissioned agent, the agent's service isused or consumed where the transient accommodation or travel-related booking is located. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Booking.com states a single point of error: "The 
circuit court erred in ruling that it lacks subject matter 
jurisdiction to hear Booking's challenge to the validity of the Department's Rule pursuant to HRS § 91-7." 
The existence of subject matter jurisdiction is a 
question of law we review de novo under the right/wrong standard. Ocean Resort Villas Vacation Owners Ass'n v. Cnty. of Maui, 147 Hawai
#i 544, 552, 465 P.3d 991, 999 (2020). Interpretation of a 
statute is also a question of law we review de novo. Id.  
We begin with the plain language of the statute. Ocean 
Resort Villas
, 147 Hawai #i at 553, 465 P.3d at 1000. HRS § 91-7 
(2012 & Supp. 2018) provides: 
Declaratory judgment on validity of rules . (a) Any
interested person may obtain a judicial declaration as to
the validity of an agency rule as provided in subsection (b)by bringing an action against the agency in the circuitcourt or, if applicable, the environmental court, of thecounty in which the petitioner resides or has its principalplace of business. The action may be maintained whether ornot the petitioner has first requested the agency to pass
upon the validity of the rule in question. 
(b) The court shall declare the rule invalid if it 
finds that it violates constitutional or statutory
provisions, or exceeds the statutory authority of theagency, or was adopted without compliance with statutoryrulemaking procedures. 
The plain language of HRS § 91-7 supports Booking.com's 
argument that the circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction 
over its declaratory judgment action. 
DOTax argued the circuit court lacked subject matter 
jurisdiction because the Hawai#i declaratory judgment statute 
provides: 
In cases of actual controversy, courts of record, within the
scope of their respective jurisdictions, shall have power tomake binding adjudications of right, whether or notconsequential relief is, or at the time could be, claimed,and no action or proceeding shall be open to objection onthe ground that a judgment or order merely declaratory of
right is prayed for; provided that declaratory relief may
not be obtained . . . in any controversy with respect to 
taxes[.]

HRS § 632-1(a) (2016) (emphasis added).5 The statute is 
jurisdictional. Island Ins. Co. v. Perry , 94 Hawai #i 498, 502, 
17 P.3d 847, 851 (App. 2000); Hawai#i
 Rules of Civil Procedure 
Rule 57 ("declaratory relief may not be obtained in any 
controversy with respect to taxes"). 
In Tax Found. of Haw. v. State, 144 Hawai #i 175, 439 
P.3d 127 (2019), Tax Foundation filed a declaratory judgment action challenging the State's calculation of its cost to administer a City and County of Honolulu rail surcharge on general excise and use taxes collected by DOTax. 
Tax Foundation 
didn't dispute liability to pay general excise and use tax or the rail surcharge itself; it challenged "only the 'administration and allocation' of the Honolulu County surcharge after it is assessed and collected." Id. at 188, 439 P.3d at 140. The supreme court held, "this is not a 'controversy with respect to taxes' and the exclusionary provision does not apply because only suits that would restrain the assessment and collection of taxes fall within the scope of HRS § 632-1." 
Then, in Ocean Resort Villas , timeshare owners sought 
declaratory relief over the constitutionality of the County of Maui's timeshare real property tax classification, which imposed a higher rate on timeshares compared to the "hotel and resort" classification. 147 Hawai #i at 547, 465 P.3d at 994. The 
supreme court noted that the complaint and two amendments all "sought declaratory relief in the form of voiding the County's real property timeshare tax, a result which would 'interfere with the assessment or collection of taxes.'" 
Id. at 556, 465 P.3d at 
1003. The court held that the lawsuit was "a 'controversy with respect to taxes,' for which declaratory relief under HRS § 632-1 
5 The prohibition against declaratory relief in controversies with
respect to taxes was added to HRS § 632–1 in 1972. 1972 Haw. Sess. Laws 
Act 89, § 1(a). It was added "to mirror the tax exclusion in the federal Declaratory Judgment Act," 28 U.S.C. § 2201, which "prohibits declaratoryrelief in tax matters to permit the government to assess and collect taxesalleged to be due it without judicial interference." Tax Found. of Haw. v. 
State
, 144 Hawai#i 175, 187, 439 P.3d 127, 139 (2019).

is not allowed. For that reason, the circuit court lacked 
jurisdiction over the Taxpayers' suit." Id. 
Booking.com argues that HRS § 91-7 independently 
creates jurisdiction in the circuit courts over declaratory judgment actions about "the validity of an agency rule," including rules promulgated by DOTax. It contends that HRS § 632-1 applies only to "cases of actual controversy," and argues — disingenuously — that 
there was no "controversy" at all between [Booking.com] and
[DOTax] at the time this action was filed, and still todaythere is no controversy between the parties that[Booking.com] seeks to have resolved by this action.Indeed, [Booking.com] does not seek any ruling regarding the
application of the Rule [HAR § 18-237-29.53-10(a)(3)] to
[Booking.com] in this action . 
(Emphasis added.) 
Booking.com, then, is not "[a]ny interested person" 
entitled to seek relief under HRS § 91-7. "[A]ny interested 
person is one who is, without restriction 'affected' by or 'involved' with the validity of an agency rule." Asato v. 
Procurement Pol'y Bd.
, 132 Hawai#i 333, 343, 322 P.3d 228, 238 
(2014) (cleaned up). If 
Booking.com doesn't seek a ruling that 
HAR § 18-237-29.53-10(a)(3) does not apply to it, it is not "any interested person" entitled to declaratory relief under HRS § 91-7. 
Here, Booking.com's complaint alleges that HAR 
§ 18-237-29.53-10(a)(3) is a discriminatory tax that violates the Internet Tax Freedom Act, 47 U.S.C. § 151, and the Commerce and Supremacy clauses of the United States Constitution. It requests a declaration that HAR § 18-237-29.53-10(a)(3) "is invalid and void." If successful, it would restrain and interfere with the assessment or collection of taxes. Under Ocean Resort Villas , 
the circuit court had no jurisdiction over Booking.com's suit.

147 Hawai #i at 556, 465 P.3d at 1003. The circuit court did not 
err by granting DOTax's motion to dismiss. 6

January 24, 2023, is affirmed.
