  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Wadsworth, Presiding Judge, and Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
Defendant/Plaintiff-Appellant Lani Pacific (LP), 
representing itself,1/ appeals from the following orders entered 
in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit2/ (Circuit Court): (1) 
the June 13, 2022 "Order to Cease Non-Attorney Representation and 
Directing [LP], a [R]egistered [B]usiness [E]ntity, to Obtain Legal Counsel" (Order to Obtain Counsel); (2) the June 27, 2022 
"Order Denying Without Prejudice [LP]'s Ex Parte Motion to Set 
Aside or Vacate [Order to Obtain Counsel] and for Other Relief Entered on 13 June 2022[,] Filed June 21, 2022" (Order Denying
Rule 60(b) Motion); and (3) the July 13, 2022 "Order Denying 
[LP]'s Amended Motion to Alter, Rescind, or Amend [Order to 
Obtain Counsel] Entered on 13 June 2022, Filed June 24[,] 2022" (Order Denying Rule 59(e) Motion). 
We previously addressed LP's appeal from the March 12, 
2021 Judgment and the July 6, 2021 Judgment (Quiet Title 
Judgment) in the underlying consolidated cases. See Deutsche 
Bank Nat'l Tr. Co., as Tr. For the Pooling & Servicing Agreement 
Dated as of Nov. 1, 2006 Securitized Asset Backed Receivables LLC Trust 2006 FR4 v. Lani Pacific (LP I), Nos. CAAP-21-0000281, CAAP-21-0000456, 2023 WL 4145925 (Haw. App. June 23, 2023) (SDO). 
While that appeal was pending, on June 13, 2022, the 
Circuit Court sua sponte entered the Order to Obtain Counsel, "based on [LP's], a registered business entity, self-representations before this court without licensed counsel[.]" The court ordered: 
1) Filings made before the Court by [LP] without the
representation of legal counsel shall be stricken fromthe record; 
2) [LP] shall have 30 (thirty) days from the filing ofthis order to obtain an attorney, licensed in thepractice of law in the State of Hawai #i, to represent
[LP] in this matter; 
1/ LP is represented on appeal by David Paul Biesemeyer ( Biesemeyer ),
as the "Sole Proprietor" of LP. 
2/ The Honorable Robert D.S. Kim presided.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
3) If [LP] fails to obtain such counsel, or request a
reasonable extension of time to do so, the Court may
enter default in this matter and take other remedial action as is deemed necessary; 
4) All further filings made through the unauthorized
practice of law will not be heard by this Court andshall continue to be stricken from the record. 
(Footnotes omitted.) 
On June 21, 2022, LP filed an ex parte motion to set 
aside the Order to Obtain Counsel, citing Hawai# i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) Rule 60(b) (
Rule 60(b) Motion). On June 23, 
2022, LP filed a motion to alter, rescind, or amend the Order to 
Obtain Counsel, citing HRCP Rule 59(e). On June 24, 2022, LP filed an amended motion to alter, rescind, or amend the Order to Obtain Counsel, citing HRCP Rules 59(e) and 60(b) (Rule 59(e)
Motion). 
The Circuit Court entered the Order Denying Rule 60(b) 
Motion on June 27, 2022, and the Order Denying Rule 59(e) Motion 
on July 13, 2022. 
On July 13, 2022, LP filed a notice of appeal from the 
Order to Obtain Counsel, creating this appeal. On July 14, 2022, LP filed an amended notice of appeal from the Order to Obtain Counsel, the Order Denying Rule 60(b) Motion, and the Order Denying Rule 59(e) Motion (collectively, the Challenged Orders). 
On appeal, LP contends that the Circuit Court erred in 
entering the Challenged Orders because LP "is not a separate legal entity, but an [a]lter [e]go of . . . Biesemeyer," and in ruling that Biesemeyer "d[id] not have [s]tanding as a [r]eal [p]arty in [i]nterest to its [a]lter [e]go, [LP.]"

condensed for clarity. To the extent that LP raises "[q]uestions presented"
regarding the Quiet Title Judgment in the underlying cases, we do not havejurisdiction over those questions, as discussed in footnote 4 below. 
We also note that LP's opening brief does not comply in material
respects with Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure ( HRAP) Rule 28(b). 
 In 
particular, the opening brief lacks a separate argument section. See HRAP 
Rule 28(b)(7). 
To promote access to justice, we liberally interpret a self-
represented litigant's briefs and do not automatically foreclose them fromappellate review because they fail to comply with court rules. Erum v. Llego,

Dep't, 104 Hawai #i 173, 180-81, 86 P.3d 982, 989-90 (2004)). We thus address 
LP's arguments to the extent they can be discerned from other parts of the

Plaintiff/Defendant-Appellee Deutsche Bank National Trust 
Company, as Trustee for the Pooling and Servicing Agreement Dated as of November 1, 2006 Securitized Asset Backed Receivables LLC Trust 2006 FR4 (Deutsche Bank) contends preliminarily that this 
court lacks jurisdiction over this appeal "because no final 
judgment had been entered when the appeal was noticed . . . and no [HRCP] Rule 54(b) certification was sought nor granted." 
After reviewing the record on appeal and the relevant 
legal authorities, and giving due consideration to the issues raised and the arguments advanced by the parties, we resolve LP's contentions as follows, and vacate the Challenged Orders. 
We have jurisdiction over this appeal under the 
collateral order doctrine. See Greer v. Baker, 137 Hawai# i 249, 
253, 369 P.3d 832, 836 (2016). First, the Order to Obtain Counsel conclusively determines the disputed question of whether Biesemeyer may represent LP as its purported sole proprietor, or whether LP must retain counsel. Second, the order resolves an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action, which concerned a mortgage foreclosure complaint and quiet title counterclaim. 
Third, the order is effectively 
unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment, as LP's right to represent itself in the first instance will have been lost. Id. 
at 254, 369 P.3d at 837 (quoting Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai# i 319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998)); 
see Grube v. Trader, 142 Hawai# i 412, 428, 420 P.3d 343, 359 
(2018) ("[T]he right of self-representation exists in both criminal and civil proceedings." (citing State v. Hutch, 75 Haw. 307, 318, 861 P.2d 11, 18 (1993))). Relatedly, if LP was improperly compelled to obtain private counsel to continue in the litigation, even assuming it had the funds to do so, it would not be able to recoup funds spent on such counsel after any appeal from a final judgment. 
The requirements of the collateral order 
doctrine are therefore satisfied as to the Challenged Orders.4/

presented" that LP appears to raise regarding the Quiet Title Judgment. See

Id. 
As to the merits of the appeal, LP contends that the 
Circuit Court erred in entering the Challenged Orders because LP 
is "not a separate legal entity" but an "alter ego" of Biesemeyer.
 In Alexander & Baldwin, LLC v. Armitage, 151 Hawai# i 
37, 508 P.3d 832 (2022), the supreme court ruled that "[a]s an unincorporated entity, the Reinstated Hawaiian Nation may only appear in court through an attorney representative[,]" and therefore two individuals, who were not attorneys, "should not have been allowed to represent its interests before the circuit court." Id. at 48, 508 P.3d at 843. The court relied on the 
rule against non-attorney representation of corporations, and reasoned that the rationale for the rule applies equally to "unincorporated entities," such as the "unincorporated association" at issue in Armitage. Id. at 43 n.1, 48, 508 P.3d 
at 838 n.1, 843; see id. at 49 n.11, 508 P.3d at 844 n.11 ("Whatever its statutory status, an unincorporated entity with multiple constituents may not be represented by a non-attorney agent in court."). 
The Armitage
 decision did not purport to change Hawai#i 
case law holding that a sole proprietorship may represent itself, via its sole proprietor, in litigation, because "the firm name and the sole proprietor's name are but two names for one person" and are not separate legal entities. 
Garcia v. Fernandez
, No. 
CAAP-18-0000375, 2020 WL 2991784, at *2 (Haw. App. June 4, 2020) (SDO) (quoting and citing Cervelli v. Aloha Bed & Breakfast, 142 Hawai#i 177, 193 n.16, 415 P.3d 919, 935 n.16 (App. 2018)); 
Credit Assocs. of Maui, Ltd. v. Carlbom, 98 Hawai# i 462, 465, 50 
P.3d 431, 434 (App. 2002). Accordingly, following the supreme court's decision in 
Armitage, this court noted in 
LP I that it 
had relied on Garcia in denying Deutsche Bank's motion to dismiss 
4/ (...continued)
Greer, 137 Hawai #i  at 254, 369 P.3d at 837 ("[T]he appeal of a collateral
order brings up for review only that order or the orders that collectively led
to entry of the collateral order appealed." (citing Cook v. Surety Life Ins.Co., 79 Hawai #i 403, 409, 903 P.2d 708, 714 (App. 1955))). In any event, we
note that LP's appeal from the Quiet Title Judgment was resolved in LP I,supra.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
the appeal on the grounds that LP was not represented by a 
Hawai#i-licensed attorney, and that Biesemeyer could not 
represent LP. LP I, 2023 WL 4145925, at * 1 n.2. Specifically, 
we noted that dismissal was denied because (1) "'Lani Pacific' is a trade name, and the circuit court found that 'Lani Pacific is registered by Biesemeyer in the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs of the State of Hawaii, Business Registration Division as a Trade Name[,]'" and (2) "Garcia held that a sole proprietorship may litigate pro se . . . ." Id. (original 
brackets omitted). 
The same reasoning applies to this appeal. Deutsche 
Bank does not dispute that LP is a sole proprietorship or that "Lani Pacific" is Biesemeyer's trade name. Indeed, Deutsche Bank asserts that "Lani Pacific has always been nothing more than a registered trade name for Biesemeyer; i.e., Lani Pacific has always been one in the same as Biesemeyer . . . ." (Capitalization altered; emphasis omitted.) As a matter of law, Biesemeyer may represent LP, his trade name, in this litigation.
5/ 
See Garcia, 2020 WL 2991784, at *2; Cervelli, 142 Hawai# i at 193 
n.16, 415 P.3d at 935 n.16; Carlbom, 98 Hawai# i at 465, 50 P.3d 
at 434. 
Deutsche Bank argues that LP's appeal should be 
dismissed under HRCP Rule 11 or the Challenged Orders "should be affirmed" on their merits because Biesemeyer has committed "a fraud upon the court" by falsely claiming in multiple court filings that LP is "a registered business entity." Deutsche Bank further argues that the Circuit Court "was compelled" to issue the Order to Obtain Counsel pursuant to the Armitage decision. 
Given the undisputed fact that LP is merely 
Biesemeyer's trade name (see supra), Armitage does not support, much less "compel," the issuance of the Order to Obtain Counsel. The Circuit Court did not purport to impose a Rule 11 sanction in compelling LP to obtain counsel, and Deutsche Bank does not cite any authority permitting such a sanction. Nor does Deutsche Bank 
5/ Additionally, LP, as a party aggrieved by the Challenged Orders,
has standing to appeal from them. See Abaya v. Mantell
, 112 Hawai #i 176, 181,
145 P.3d 719, 724 (2006).

point to any findings by the Circuit Court that would support the 
imposition of such a sanction in these circumstances. See Trs. 
of Estate of Bishop v. Au, 146 Hawai# i 272, 282-83, 463 P.3d 929, 
939-40 (2020). 
In sum, the Circuit Court erred in entering the 
Order to Obtain Counsel. 
For the reasons discussed above, we vacate the 
following orders entered in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit: (1) the June 13, 2022 "Order to Cease Non-Attorney Representation and Directing Defendant Lani Pacific, a [R]egistered [B]usiness [E]ntity, to Obtain Legal Counsel"; (2) the June 27, 2022 "Order Denying Without Prejudice Defendant/Plaintiff Lani Pacific's Ex Parte Motion to Set Aside or Vacate Order to Cease Non-Attorney Representation and Directing Defendant Lani Pacific, a Registered Business Entity, to Obtain Legal Counsel and for Other Relief Entered on 13 June 2022[,] Filed June 21, 2022"; and (3) the July 13, 2022 "Order Denying Defendant-Plaintiff Lani Pacific's Amended Motion to Alter, Rescind, or Amend Order Entered on 13 June 2022, Filed June 24[,] 2022." 
This case is remanded to the Circuit Court for 
further proceedings consistent with this Summary Disposition Order.
