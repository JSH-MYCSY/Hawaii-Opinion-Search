  Upon consideration of Claimant-Appellant-Appellant Augustina J. Dean's Motion for Reconsideration filed on July 13, 2023, which this court construes as a second motion for reconsideration of this court's June 30, 2023 summary disposition order, it appears that the Motion for 
Reconsideration is unauthorized.  See Hawai‘ i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure Rule 40(e) ("Only one motion for reconsideration may 
be filed by any party . . . .").   Therefore, IT IS ORDERED that the Motion for Reconsideration is denied.
