2022 Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law (FOF and COL). 
Defendant-Appellee/Cross-Appellant N.H. (Father) cross-appeals

1 The Honorable Wendy M. DeWeese presided.    
 
   Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve the 
parties' points of error as discussed below. 
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(1) Mother raises three points of error on appeal. First, Mother argues that the family court failed to 
comply with the statutory requirements under Hawai
‘i Revised 
Statutes (HRS) § 571-46(a)(9) (2018) "when the issue of domestic 
abuse became an aggravating factor" in the case. 
Under HRS § 571-46(a)(9), 
a determination by the court that family violence has been 
committed by a parent raises a rebuttable presumption that 
it is detrimental to the child and not in the best interest 
of the child to be placed in sole custody, joint legal 
custody, or joint physical custody with the perpetrator of family violence. 
 
The family court, however, did not determine either parent was a 
perpetrator of family violence. 
Instead, in unchallenged 
Amended FOF 31, the family court found "both parties have accused the other of domestic violence[,]" "the evidence on this 
issue is unclear to the Court especially in light of the 
parties' questionable credibility[,]" and there appear to have been physical altercations, but "it [was] impossible to 
determine with any sense of certainty whether one parent [was] 
the primary aggressor . . . ." See In re Doe
, 99 Hawai‘i 522, 
538, 57 P.3d 447, 463 (2002) ("Unchallenged findings are binding 
2    
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
on appeal."). With no determination of domestic violence, HRS 
§ 571-46(a)(9) was not applicable. 
Next, Mother contends the presumptions of joint 
custody under HRS §§ 571-46(a)(1) and 571-46.1 (2018) unduly 
prejudice and discriminate against mothers who report domestic 
abuse or family violence on the basis of sex and marital status, 
violating due process and equal protection. 
Contrary to Mother's contention, there was no equal 
protection violation. See Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U.S. 429, 433 
(1984) ("The goal of granting custody based on the best 
interests of the child is . . . a substantial governmental 
interest for" equal protection purposes); Williamson v. Basco, 
Civil No. 06-00012 JMS/LEK, 2007 WL 4570496 at *6 (D. Haw. 
Dec. 31, 2007) (Order) ("HRS § 571-46, containing the 'best 
interests of the child' standard, constitutes a reasonable 
regulation of parental rights upon the dissolution of 
marriage"). Further, Mother received due process as she participated in the trial, was represented by counsel, 
testified, and had the opportunity to cross-examine Father's 
witnesses. See DJ v. CJ
, 147 Hawai‘i 2, 17, 464 P.3d 790, 805 
(2020) (explaining that "parental rights cannot be denied 
without an opportunity for them to be heard at a meaningful time 
and in a meaningful manner") (cleaned up)).

Finally, Mother contends the family court abused its 
discretion by "allowing [Father] to remove 100% of her 
income[,]" pay her equalization, and then "retain the business," 
while she would be forced to start over.2 
The family court considered the circumstances of the 
case as HRS § 580-47 (2018) requires. Moreover, the family 
court found that 
in view of Wife's continued inability and unwillingness to 
pay (Wife has spent money on other things from her business 
income in lieu of paying Husband what he is owed), the 
Court sees no realistic way to ensure Husband receives what 
is owed to him as long as Wife remains in control and 
possession of the business. 
Mother does not challenge this finding in her points of error. 
Because the family court considered the factors required under 
the statute and unchallenged findings support its decision, the 
family court did not abuse its discretion in dividing the 
business. See Gordon v. Gordon, 135 Hawai‘ i 340, 348-49, 350 
P.3d 1008, 1016-17 (2015) (vesting the family court with "wide 
discretion to divide marital partnership property according to 
what is 'just and equitable' based on the facts and 
circumstances of each case") (citation omitted); Baker v. 
Bielski, 124 Hawai‘ i 455, 464, 248 P.3d 221, 230 (App. 2011) 
2 Mother also maintains her rights under article 1, sections 2, 4- 7, 
10, and 12 of the Hawai‘ i Constitution and the first, fourth, fifth, eighth, 
ninth, and fourteenth amendments of the U.S. Constitution were denied. 
Mother, however, does not explain how the family court's division of assets 
violated her constitutional rights. See Hawai‘i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
Rule 28(b)(7) (providing "[p]oints not argued may be deemed waived"). 
4    
 
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(determining "family court was not required to divide each asset 
and debt equally, and the court properly equalized the property 
based on numerous, undisputed FOFs regarding the circumstances 
of the marriage pursuant to HRS § 580-47"). 
(2) Father raises three points of error on cross-appeal. First, Father challenges "awarding physical custody of 
the parties' children to Mother with visitation to Father only in the form of dinner and therapeutic visits[.]" Father also challenges Amended FOF 1, contending "the family court's finding 
that 'neither party is particularly credible' and that 'neither 
parent has demonstrated the ability to place the best interest 
of their children above their own battle with the other parent' 
. . . is in error, and not supported by the evidence at trial." 
We will not disturb credibility determinations, and 
the remainder of Amended FOF 1 was supported by substantial 
evidence in the record. LC v. MG & Child Support Enf't Agency, 
143 Hawai‘ i 302, 310-11, 430 P.3d 400, 408-09 (2018) (regarding 
credibility); In re Doe, 95 Hawai‘ i 183, 190, 20 P.3d 616, 623 
(2001) (providing clearly erroneous standard of review for FOF). However, the family court abused its discretion when it a 
restricted Father's visitation to one therapy session per week 
or a dinner visit from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. on Wednesday if 
Father did not see the children during therapy. 
5    
 
  
  
  
    
 
  
    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"Reasonable visitation rights shall be awarded to 
parents . . . in the discretion of the court, unless it is shown 
that rights of visitation are detrimental to the best interests 
of the child[.]"  HRS § 571-46(a)(7). Although the family court 
made many findings regarding custody, in restricting Father's visitation to one therapy session or a two-hour dinner once a 
week, the family court found that "[t]he need to eliminate 
conflict for the children outweighs the need to craft a visitation plan that includes substantial time for the other 
parent." This finding, however, does not explain how one 
therapy session or a two-hour dinner per week with Father for 
the rest of children's childhood (absent a court-ordered 
modification) is reasonable. This finding also does not show 
how the "rights of visitation"  (as opposed to conflict between 
Mother and Father) was detrimental to the children's best interests. Thus, the family court disregarded HRS § 571-
46(a)(7) to Father's substantial detriment. 43
Next, Father contends "the Family Court err[ed] and 
abuse[d] its discretion in awarding joint legal custody to the 
3 Many consider the term "visitation" outmoded, preferring "'Parenting 
Time' because it speaks to what actually takes place: parenting. Some also 
view it as a more respectful term (parents do not 'visit' children, they 
'parent' children)." 2015 Hawaiʻ i Divorce Manual, § 3 ( 9th ed. 2015). 
4 "Visitation is not only a right and responsibility of a parent but 
children have a right to have parenting time with each of their parents, 
unless there are tangible risks to the child's well- being in the parent- child 
relationship." 2015 Hawaiʻ i Divorce Manual, § 3 ( 9th ed. 2015).

parties but then ordering 'tie breaking' authority to Father as 
to medical decisions and to Mother as to all other decisions, 
while limiting Father's ability to make those decisions[.]" 
Father claims "[t]his is clearly unworkable." 
As discussed above, unchallenged findings support the 
family court's award of physical custody to Mother. Moreover, 
the family court found Mother testified essential oils were "a 
better alternative treatment to vaccines and antibiotics," and determined "with [Father's] medical background and his desire to 
rely on scientific evidence rather than religion or leaving 
medical decisions to the children (who are too young to 
competently do so), the children's best interests will be better 
served by Father making the final decisions regarding their 
medical care[.]" Amended FOF 34 and 39. The family court 
further found "both parents should be listed on all of the 
children's records, including but not limited to school, mental 
health, and medical" and "[b]oth parents should have access to information concerning the children." Amended FOF 38. These 
findings support the family court's decision to award joint 
legal custody with Father having tie breaking authority 
regarding medical care. See also KS v. RS
, 151 Hawaiʻi 336, 345, 
512 P.3d 702, 714 (App. 2022) (concluding "the Family Court was 
not precluded from ordering joint legal custody with tie-
breaking authority to one parent, based on its broad discretion, 
7    
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
if the Court determined that this was in the Child's best 
interests"). 
Finally, Father contends "the Family Court [abused its 
discretion] in failing to award" him attorney's fees and costs. 
Father challenges Amended FOF 77, which states in part that 
"[Wife] has advanced sums to the Discovery Master and the 
[custody evaluator] on Husband's behalf." 
The family court, determining it was fair and 
reasonable, ordered "[e]ach party shall pay his/her own attorney fees and costs, except as previously otherwise ordered." HRS 
§§ 580-9 and -47(f) (2018). The family court noted the earning 
capacity of each party. In unchallenged Amended FOF 76, the 
family court determined "[b]oth parties have spent, what the 
Court would characterize as excessive amounts on attorneys and 
other costs" and both sides drove "litigation in this case, 
whether about custody, visitation, or financial matters." Based 
on these findings, we cannot say ordering each party to pay his or her own attorney's fees and costs was an abuse of discretion. 
See Hamilton v. Hamilton
, 138 Hawai‘i 185, 209-10, 378 P.3d 901, 
925-26 (2016) ("[A]n award of attorney's fees is in the sound 
discretion of the trial court, limited only by the standard that 
it be fair and reasonable.") (citations omitted). 
Regarding the fees for the custody evaluator, the 
record shows the family court previously ruled the parties were 
8    
 
   
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to split the cost of the custody evaluator's preparation time, 
and Mother was to pay for cross-examination time. Thus, the 
record does not support the portion of Amended FOF 77 stating 
Mother advanced the fees for the custody evaluator. This error, 
however, does not require vacating the family court's decision 
as to attorney's fees and costs. 
For the above reasons, we vacate in part the family 
court's August 22, 2022 Amended Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, and September 13, 2022 Divorce Decree, and remand for 
further proceedings consistent with this summary disposition 
order, as to Father's visitation. We affirm the family court's 
August 22, 2022 Amended Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, 
and September 13, 2022 Divorce Decree in all other respects.
