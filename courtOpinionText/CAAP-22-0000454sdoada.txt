APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
KONA DIVISION 
(CASE NO. 3FDA-22-0000696)  
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: 
Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka and McCullen, JJ.) 
Petitioner-Appellant T.H. (
Mother) appeals from the 
Family Court of the Third Circuit's July 18, 2022 "Order 
Dissolving Temporary Restraining Order for Protection" (Order 
Dissolving TRO).1 On appeal, Mother argues the family court

abused its discretion in dissolving the TRO on Respondent-
Appellee N.H.'s (Father) res judicata claims.  2
Upon careful review of the record and the brief 
submitted by Mother  and having given due consideration to the 
issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve the points of error as discussed below, and affirm. 3
On June 20, 2022, Mother filed a Petition for an Order 
of Protection against Father on behalf of herself and their three children. In the petition, she detailed five separate 
2 Mother raises the following four points on appeal: 
1. The family court abused its discretion in dissolving the TRO 
on Father's "[res judicata] claims, interpreting . . . the 
requisite element to establish a valid preclusion claim was a dismissal on the merits of a petition submitted for 
preliminary review and not a fully litigated matter"; 
2. The family court erred in considering hearsay as part of 
probable cause determinations for a restraining order related 
to "family violence" as defined in H awai
 ‘i Revised Statutes 
(HRS
) § 571-2 (2018) and a "history of sexual or physical 
abuse of a child by a parent" following HRS § 571-46(b)(1) 
(2018); 
3. The family court erred in expediting the evidentiary hearing, 
holding it at the same time as the order to show cause 
hearing, and ignoring the requirement the respondent must 
provide evidence to support the TRO's dismissal; and 
4. The family court erred in denying Mother
's "right to submit 
relevant evidence . . . , which would have established her 
claims of domestic abuse." 
Mother, however, does not provide a discernible argument on her second, 
third, and fourth points of error. See Hawai‘i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
(HRAP) Rule 28(b)(7) ("[p]oints not argued may be deemed waived"). Thus, we 
address Mother's first point of error regarding res judicata in this 
decision. 
3 Father did not file an answering brief. The appellate clerk entered 
a notice of default of answering brief on September 11, 2023.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
incidents of purported abuse, dated April 2017; November 8, 
2019; January 2-3, 2021; January 5, 2022; and June 17-18, 2022. 
Three of the incidents occurred at custodial exchanges, and the 
other two appear to have occurred during Father's custodial or 
visitation times with the children. 
Father moved to dissolve the TRO as "[t]his is the 
FOURTH petition for a restraining order Mother has filed in the 
past year and a half" and the last three petitions "were all rightfully denied." He explained the only new information in 
Mother's current petition was about the June 2022 incident, 
which did not occur as Mother described it. 
The family court dissolved the TRO finding that the 
allegations of abuse occurring prior to January 18, 2022 were 
barred by res judicata. 
The family court further found the 
allegations dated June 2022 did "not establish probable cause" to constitute domestic abuse or establish a basis for relief 
under 
Hawai‘i Revised Statutes (HRS) Chapter 586. 
Res judicata, or claim preclusion "prohibits a party 
from relitigating a previously adjudicated cause of action" and 
"limit[s] a litigant to one opportunity to litigate aspects of 
the case to prevent inconsistent results and multiplicity of 
suits and to promote finality and judicial economy." Tortorello
v. Tortorello, 113 Hawai‘i 432, 439, 153 P.3d 1117, 1124 (2007)

(quoting Bremer v. Weeks, 104 Hawai‘ i 43, 53, 85 P.3d 150, 160 
(2004)). Further, 
the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction is a bar 
to a new action in any court between the same parties or 
their privies concerning the same subject matter, and 
precludes the relitigation, not only of the issues which 
were actually litigated in the first action, but also of 
all grounds of claim and defense which might have been 
properly litigated in the first action but were not 
litigated or decided. 
Id. And, 
[t]he party asserting claim preclusion has the burden of 
establishing . . . (1) there was a final judgment on the 
merits, (2) both parties are the same or in privity with the parties in the original suit, and (3) the claim decided 
in the original suit is identical with the one presented in the action in question. 
Tortorello, 113 Hawai‘ i at 439, 153 P.3d at 1124 (quoting Bremer, 
104 Hawai‘ i
 at 54, 85 P.3d at 161). 
  Claim preclusion "applies to successive HRS 
Chapter 586 . . . protective order cases filed by the same 
petitioner against the same respondent where the second case is 
based on events that occurred, and that the petitioner knew 
about, prior to the filing of the first petition." Tortorello
v. Tortorello, 112 Hawai‘ i 219, 222, 145 P.3d 762, 765 
(App. 2006), aff'd 113 
Hawai‘i 432, 437, 441, 153 P.3d 1117, 
1122, 1126 (2007). 
In all four petitions, Mother petitioned on behalf of 
herself and the three children against Father, so the parties 
were the same. 
Except for the June 17-18, 2022 incident (of 
which Mother does not challenge the family court's decision), 
4

the other incidents were raised, and ruled on, in the divorce 
proceedings and the previous petitions for orders of protection.4 
Thus, under Tortorello, the family court did not err in determining that claim preclusion applied. See generally, 
Griffin ex. rel. Griffin v. Davenport, 130 Hawai‘ i 347, 310 P.3d 
1048, CAAP-10-0000242, 2012 WL 1138937 at *3-*4 (App. Apr. 5, 
2012) (Mem. Op.). 
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the family court's 
July 18, 2022 Order Dissolving TRO. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai‘ i, March 12, 2024.

4 Without raising it as a separate point of error, Mother argues the 
divorce proceedings should not be considered for res judicata purposes in the 
petition for orders of protection. See HRAP Rule 28(b)(4) (noting "[p]oints 
not presented in accordance with this section will be disregarded"). Even if we considered this argument, the three previous petitions were filed on 
January 8, 2021, January 11, 2022, and January 18, 2022, which was after the 
April 2017 and November 2019 incidents discussed in the divorce proceeding. Thus, the incidents addressed in the divorce proceedings could have been 
litigated in the previous three petitions. See generally, Tortorello
, 113 
Hawai‘i at 439, 153 P.3d at 1124.
