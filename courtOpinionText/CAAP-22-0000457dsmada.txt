Upon consideration of the Motion for Order Dismissing 
Appeal (
Motion), filed September 28, 2022, by Plaintiff-Appellee 
U.S.
 Bank National Association, the papers in support and in 
opposition, and the record, it appears we lack appellate

(Circuit Court) June 28, 2022 "Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion 
for Leave to File First Amended Complaint, Filed June 3, 2022" 
(Order) in Civil No. 3CC15100031K, because the Circuit Court has 
not entered a final, appealable judgment under Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS) §§ 641-1(a) (2016) or 667-51 (2016). Bank of 
America, N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 139

Hawai# i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994); Hawai# i  Rules of 
Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 58. Additionally, the Circuit Court 
has not certified the Order for appeal in a HRCP Rule 54(b) 
judgment or granted leave to file an interlocutory appeal under HRS § 641-1(b) (2016), and neither the Forgay
1 doctrine nor the 
collateral order exception apply here. Greer v. Baker, 137 Hawai# i 249, 253, 369 P.3d 832, 836 (2016). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is 
granted and the appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are 
dismissed.
