OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I  
SACOR FINANCIAL, INC., Plaintiff-Appellant,
v. 
R
ICHARD B. NALUAI, Defendant-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
KO#OLAUPOKO DIVISION 
(CIVIL NO. 1RC111012229) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: 
Ginoza, Chief Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Plaintiff-Appellant Sacor
 Financial, Inc. appeals from 
the Order denying its motion for extension of judgment, entered 
by the District Court of the First Circuit, Ko# olaupoko Division, 
on June 29, 2022.1 For the reasons explained below, we vacate 
the Order and remand for further proceedings. 
Sacor filed a complaint against Defendant-Appellee 
Richard B. Naluai in the district court on December 30, 2011, for 
money owed. Naluai was served on January 25, 2012. He admitted 
the debt. A judgment against him was entered on March 5, 2012. An amended judgment was entered on June 7, 2012. 
1 Sacor's opening brief identifies the Honorable Karin L. Holma as
the judge who entered the Order, but we are unable to verify this from the
record on appeal. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On June 16, 2022, Sacor filed a motion for extension of 
judgment pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 657-5. 
Sacor served its motion upon Naluai by mail. Naluai didn't 
respond to the motion. The district court denied the motion as "Untimely[.]" This appeal followed. 
Sacor raises two points of error: (1) "The district 
court erred when it denied the Motion for Extension for finding that it was untimely"; and (2) "The district court erred when it raised the statute of limitations defense sua sponte on behalf of Mr. Naluai." Naluai didn't file an answering brief. Sacor's second point of error is dispositive. 
HRS § 657-5 (2016) provides, in relevant part: 
Unless an extension is granted, every judgment and decree of
any court of the State shall be presumed to be paid anddischarged at the expiration of ten years after the judgmentor decree was rendered. . . . No extension of a judgment or
decree shall be granted unless the extension is soughtwithin ten years of the date the original judgment or decreewas rendered . 
(Emphasis added.) "HRS § 657–5 is a statute of limitations for 
actions to enforce domestic judgments, and it includes a deadline for seeking to extend the time period to enforce the judgment." United Public Workers Local 646 v. Houghton, 139 Hawai# i 138, 
142, 384 P.3d 914, 918 (App. 2016) (citing Est. of Roxas v. Marcos, 121 Hawai# i 59, 66, 214 P.3d 598, 605 (2009)). 
The supreme court has held: 
The defense of the statute of limitations is a personal
defense and the defendant alone may exercise or waive thesame. As stated in Borba v. Kaina, 22 Haw. 721 (1915), thedefense of the statute of limitations may not be invoked onbehalf of the defendant by the court. 
City Collectors, Ltd. v. Moku, 50 Haw. 273, 274, 439 P.2d 217, 
218 (1968). In this case, the district court erred by sua sponte invoking the statute of limitations defense on behalf of Naluai. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the district 
court's June 29, 2022 Order, and remand to the district court for 
further proceedings consistent with this summary disposition order.
