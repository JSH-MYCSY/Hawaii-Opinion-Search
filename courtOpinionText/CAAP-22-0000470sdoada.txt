SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Hiraoka and Nakasone, JJ.)
 
In these consolidated appeals Respondent-Appellant
Father appeals from the: 
(1) Order Terminating Parental Rights 
over NF  and AF  (the Twins) entered by the Family Court of the 
First Circuit on August 1, 2022, in FC-S No. 17-00211 (the First 
Case), and; (2) Order Terminating Parental Rights over HF 
entered by the family court on August 1, 2022, in FC-S 1
1 When the Petition for Temporary Foster Custody was filed in FC-S
No. 20-00192, HF was identified as HG. The caption was amended when the
family court received the birth certificate. HF's birth certificate does not identify a father. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
No. 20-00192 (the Second Case).2 Father is the natural and legal 
father of the Twins,3 and the alleged natural father of HF 
(collectively, Children).4 For the reasons explained below, we 
affirm. 
Mother gave birth to Children's biological sister, EF, 
in 2016. On July 29, 2016, Petitioner-Appellee Department of 
Human Services (DHS) received a report of threat of abuse and 
threatened neglect of EF. DHS didn't immediately file a petition 
for foster custody because Mother and Father (Parents) agreed to 
participate in Intensive Home-Based Services (IHBS); live with 
paternal grandmother; attend all medical appointments for 
themselves and for EF; and maintain contact with an IHBS case worker. Parents stopped participating in IHBS after two weeks and left paternal grandmother's residence with EF. DHS then confirmed a threat of abuse to and neglect of EF and filed a petition for temporary foster custody upon location, which the family court granted on August 31, 2016. EF died on September 1, 2016, before she could be located. An autopsy and investigation were conducted, but the cause and manner of EF's death were undetermined. 
The Twins were born in 2017. DHS filed a petition for 
temporary foster custody of the Twins soon after their birth. The family court granted the petition. The Twins' date of entry into foster care was November 28, 2017. Father appealed. We affirmed. In re NF and AF, No. CAAP-18-0000948, 2019 WL 6830828 
(Haw. App. Dec. 13, 2019) (SDO). The supreme court rejected Father's application for writ of certiorari. In re NF and AF, 
No. SCWC-18-0000948, 2020 WL 1675713 (Haw. Apr. 6, 2020). 
2 The Honorable Andrew T. Park presided over both cases.

2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HF was born in 2020. DHS filed a petition for 
temporary foster custody of HF soon after her birth. The family 
court granted the petition. HF's date of entry into foster care was January 8, 2021. 
DHS then filed petitions to terminate Parents' parental 
rights as to all the Children. The family court conducted a hearing on April 28, May 23, and July 18, 2022. Mother did not appear at the hearing. Father attended the April 28 and July 18, 2022 hearings and testified on his own behalf. The family court entered orders terminating parental rights on August 1, 2022. These appeals by Father followed. 
Relevant to these appeals, Hawaii Revised Statutes 
(HRS) ยง 587A-33 "provides that the family court shall terminate a 
parent's parental rights if it finds [by clear and convincing 
evidence] that: (1) the parent is not able to provide a safe family home for the child now or within a reasonable period of time; [and] (2) the proposed permanent plan is in the best interests of the child[.]" In re R Child., 145 Hawai# i 477, 483, 
454 P.3d 418, 424 (2019) (statutory citations omitted). 
Generally, the family court possesses wide discretion in
making its decisions and those decision[s] will not be setaside unless there is a manifest abuse of discretion. Thus,we will not disturb the family court's decisions on appealunless the family court disregarded rules or principles oflaw or practice to the substantial detriment of a partylitigant and its decision clearly exceeded the bounds ofreason. 
Id. at 482, 454 P.3d at 423 (citation omitted). 
Father's opening brief does not comply with Rule 11 of 
the Rules Expediting Child Protective Appeals. However, we 
attempt to decide cases on the merits, where possible. O'Connor 
v. Diocese of Honolulu, 77 Hawai# i 383, 386, 885 P.2d 361, 364 
(1994). 
Accordingly, we address what we discern to be Father's 
arguments on appeal. 
Father challenges a number of the family court's 
findings of fact, and argues that the family court erred by considering the circumstances of EF's death. 
The label of a 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
finding of fact (FOF) or a conclusion of law (COL) does not 
determine the standard of review. See Crosby v. State Dep't of 
Budget & Fin., 76 Hawai# i 332, 340, 876 P.2d 1300, 1308 (1994). 
The question whether a determination is an FOF or a COL is a 
question of law. 
Thus, the accuracy of the label affixed by the 
family court is freely reviewable by a reviewing court. Kilauea 
Neighborhood Ass'n v. Land Use Comm'n
, 7 Haw. App. 227, 229, 751 
P.2d 1031, 1034 (1988) (citation omitted). 
The family court's determinations with respect to
(1) whether a child's parent is willing and able to providea safe family home for the child and (2) whether it isreasonably foreseeable that a child's parent will becomewilling and able to provide a safe family home within areasonable period of time present mixed questions of law andfact; thus, inasmuch as the family court's determinations inthis regard are dependant upon the facts and circumstancesof each case, they are reviewed on appeal under the clearlyerroneous standard. Likewise, the family court'sdetermination of what is or is not in a child's best interests is reviewed on appeal for clear error. 
Moreover, the family court is given much leeway in its
examination of the reports concerning a child's care,custody, and welfare, and its conclusions in this regard, ifsupported by the record and not clearly erroneous, muststand on appeal. 
In re JM, 150 Hawai# i 125, 137, 497 P.3d 140, 152 (App. 2021) 
(cleaned up) (quoting In re Doe, 95 Hawai# i 183, 190, 20 P.3d 
616, 623 (2001)). 
In the First Case, Father challenges the following 
determinations by the family court: 
65. The facts of [EF]'s case are relevant to the DHS
assessment of harm in this case because the death of a sibling due to abuse/neglect or under uncertaincircumstances is a safety factor that is considered by theDHS in its assessment of whether harm or threatened harm is still present in the current safety assessment. 
66. The facts and circumstances of [EF]'s death are
relevant to the issues before the Court in this contested TPR trial. In deciding whether the Child[ren] are subjectto harm or threatened harm by the acts or omissions of theParents, and whether the Parents can provide a safe home forthe Child[ren] even with the assistance of a service plan,the Court notes that most, if not all, of the same safetyissues that were present when [EF] died were also presentduring the current DHS management, and that these safetyissues remained unresolved. 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
. . . . 
77. The circumstances surrounding [EF]'s death are
evidence of the reasonably foreseeable substantial risk of
harm to the Children posed by the Parents in this case. 
a. On the day of [EF]'s death, Father contacted
the Department of the Medical Examiner directly to reportthat he had found his daughter unresponsive early thatmorning in her bassinet in a van in which they had beenliving. 
The Parents did not contact emergency services or
police and instead placed the baby in a car seat in adifferent vehicle and drove around with the body for severalhours before reporting the death. [EF]'s body was receivedapproximately 18 hours after discovery and [EF] wasofficially pronounced dead at 9:00 p.m. on September 1,2016. 
b. The Parents' behavior after [EF] was
discovered unresponsive is evidence of threatened harm tothe Children in this case: A reasonably safe and prudentparent would have immediately called 9-1-1 upon discoveringtheir newborn child unresponsive. Neither Mother nor Father called 9-1-1 at any point after the discovery. This evidence is not limited to threatened harm; it also goes tosafety of the family home and the appropriateness of theservice plan. 
c. After discovering that [EF] was
unresponsive, Father performed CPR and massaged [EF]'schest. Father felt that [EF]'s body "still had some heat at2:30 a.m." but there was "no heat at 2:50 a.m." so he assumed that she was dead. 
d. Mother was aware of [EF]'s condition from
the time of discovery, and there is no evidence that sheattempted to contact emergency responders or that sheotherwise attempted to obtain immediate assistance. 
e. Before presenting themselves at the medical
examiner's office, the Parents drove around with [EF]'s bodyin the car and did "errands" which included withdrawingmoney from an ATM; waiting at a car repair shop for 2.5hours until the shop opened; going to Wal-Mart to obtainphone cards; and going to Carl's Jr. for breakfast. 
. . . . 
86. Houselessness alone is not a safety concern, so a
physical, residential address is not required. 
Parents 
could live in a tent anywhere, provided that the livingsituation is assessed as safe. However, [EF] died whileparents were houseless, which heightens the need for the DHSto assess the safety of parents' living arrangements. 
. . . . 
110. Father has been given the opportunity to engage
in the services recommended by the DHS in services [sic]plans dated October 2, 2017, June 25, 2018, January 24,2019, October 15, 2019, March 24, 2020, October 12, 2020, 
5  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
December 14, 2020, October 1, 2021, and March 23, 2022. All 
the service plans were fair, appropriate, and comprehensive,and provide the steps necessary to facilitate the return ofthe Children to the family home. 
. . . . 
125. Father is not willing and able to provide the
Children with a safe family home, even with the assistance
of a service plan, nor is it reasonably foreseeable that hewill become willing and able to provide a safe family home,even with the assistance of a service plan in the reasonablyforeseeable future. 
. . . . 
127. Under the circumstances presented by the instant
case, the DHS has exerted reasonable and active efforts to
reunify the Children with Father by identifying necessary,appropriate, and reasonable services to address Father'sidentified safety issues, and making the appropriate andtimely referrals for these services. 
128. Under the circumstances presented by the instant
case, the DHS gave Father every opportunity to succeed inremedying the problems which subjected the Children tosubstantial risk of being harmed in the family home. 
In the Second Case, Father challenges the following 
determinations by the family court: 
47. The facts of [EF]'s case are relevant to the DHS
assessment of harm in this case because the death of a sibling due to abuse/neglect or under uncertaincircumstances is a safety factor that is considered by theDHS in its assessment of whether harm or threatened harm is still present in the current safety assessment. 
48. The facts and circumstances of [EF]'s death are
relevant to the issues before the Court in this contested TPR trial. In deciding whether the Child are [sic] subjectto harm or threatened harm by the acts or omissions of theParents, and whether the Parents can provide a safe home forthe Child even with the assistance of a service plan, theCourt notes that most, if not all, of the same safety issuesthat were present when [EF] died were also present duringthe current DHS case management, and that these safetyissues remained unresolved. 
. . . . 
62. The Parents' behavior after [EF] was discovered
unresponsive is evidence of threatened harm to the [Children
in this case]: A reasonably safe and prudent parent wouldhave immediately called 9-1-1 upon discovering their newbornchild unresponsive. Neither Mother nor Father called 9-1-1 at any point after the discovery. 
. . . . 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
114. Father is not willing and able to provide the
Child with a safe family home, even with the assistance of a
service plan, nor is it reasonably foreseeable that he willbecome willing and able to provide a safe family home, evenwith the assistance of a service plan in the reasonablyforeseeable future. 
. . . . 
116. Under the circumstances presented by the instant
case, the DHS has exerted reasonable and active efforts to
reunify the Child with Father by identifying necessary,appropriate, and reasonable services to address Father'sidentified safety issues, and making the appropriate andtimely referrals for these services. 
117. Under the circumstances presented by the instant
case, the DHS gave Father every opportunity to succeed inremedying the problems which subjected the Child tosubstantial risk of being harmed in the family home. 
The family court's combined findings and conclusions 
were supported by substantial evidence in the record and 
reflected a correct application of the law. See HRS ยง 587A-
7(a)(4)(D);5 In re Doe, 95 Hawai# i at 191, 20 P.3d at 624 ("the 
family court may 'look to the past and present conditions of thehome and natural parents so as to gain insights into the qualityof care the child may reasonably be expected to receive in the   
future'") (quoting Woodruff v. Keale, 64 Haw. 85, 99, 637 P.2d 760, 769 (1981)). A number of unchallenged findings in the First Case and the Second Case also detail the circumstances surrounding EF's death.
6 The family court did not abuse its 
5 HRS ยง 587A-7 (2018) provides, in relevant part: 
(a) The following factors shall be fully considered when
determining whether a child's family is willing and able to
provide the child with a safe family home: 
. . . . 
(4) Facts regarding the alleged perpetrators of harm
to the child, . . . which facts shall include: 
. . . . (D) Prior involvement in services[.] 
6 See FOF nos. 49-64 in the First Case and FOF nos. 31-46 in the 
Second Case. 
7  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
discretion by determining that the circumstances of EF's death 
were relevant to DHS's assessment of harm and the contested issues in the termination of Father's parental rights for Children. 
Father argues that the family court erred by finding he 
was not able to provide a safe family home for Children. The family court's determination was supported by FOF no. 125 and unchallenged FOF nos. 89-91 and 97-106 in the First Case, and by FOF no. 114 and unchallenged FOF nos. 69-95 in the Second Case, which detail Father's lack of housing and inability to supervise the Children. The family court's determination that Father was not able to provide a safe family home for Children was not clearly erroneous. 
Father argues that DHS failed to provide him with a 
reasonable opportunity to reunify with the Children. He fails to cite where in the record the error allegedly occurred, or how it was preserved for appeal. However, we note that FOF nos. 127-28 and unchallenged FOF nos. 88-89 in the First Case, and FOF nos. 116-17 and unchallenged FOF nos. 74-75 in the Second Case, detail the frequency of Parents' visits with Children and the number and kinds of service plans offered to Father by DHS.
7 
Father does not contest FOF no. 110 in the First Case, or FOF no. 99 in the Second Case, which determined that the service plans offered by DHS were fair, appropriate, and comprehensive, and provided steps that would be necessary to return the Children to the family home. 
Father argues that the family court erred by finding 
that his mental health history subjected the Twins to threatened harm. However, Father does not contest FOF no. 76 in the First Case and FOF no. 59 in the Second Case, which found that Children were subject to threatened harm based upon Parents' histories of mental health problems. Those unchallenged findings are binding

mental health assessment, psychiatric treatment and recommendation, therapy,
parenting classes and education, and home-based outreach services.

on appeal. In re Doe, 99 Hawai# i at 538, 57 P.3d at 463. Father 
also argues that the family court erred by finding that Parents' 
act of leaving the Twins in the hospital threatened harm to the twins. 
Father cites to no such finding, and we find none. 
Father's argument lacks merit. 
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the "Order 
Terminating Parental Rights" entered by the family court on August 1, 2022, in FC-S No. 17-00211 and the "Order Terminating Parental Rights" entered by the family court on August 1, 2022, in FC-S No. 20-00192.
