NO.  CAAP-22-0000483 
IN  THE  INTERMEDIATE  COURT  OF  APPEALS 
OF  THE  STATE  OF  HAWAI I 
BERT  YAMAMOTO,  by  his  Managing  Agent,  IVY  K.  REALTY,  LLC, 
Plaintiff-Appellee,  v. 
ELENA  L.  MANGINSAY  and  BRUCE  L.  JOHNSON, 
Defendants-Appellants. 
APPEAL  FROM  THE  DISTRICT  COURT  OF  THE  FIRST  CIRCUIT 
EWA  DIVISION 
(CASE  NO.  1DRC-22-0003231) 
ORDER  DISMISSING  APPEAL 
(By:   Leonard,   Acting  Chief  Judge,  Hiraoka,   and  Wadsworth,   JJ.) 
Upon
 review of the record, it appears that: 
(1) On
 March 18, 2025, the court ordered that within 
ten days from the order, self-represented Defendants-Appellants 
Elena L. Manginsay and Bryce L. Johnson (together, Appellants ) 
shall (a) either pay the filing fee in the full amount to the 
Supreme Court Clerk's Office, or file a motion for leave to 
proceed on appeal in forma pauperis that complies with Hawai i 
Rules
 of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 24(a); and (b) show 
cause, in the form of a declaration, affidavit, or other sworn 
statement, indicating why the appeal should not be dismissed as 
moot. The court cautioned Appellants that failure to comply 
with the order may result in the appeal being dismissed; 
(2) The appellate clerk mailed the March 18, 2025 order 
to Appellants at their address on record but it was returned 
as not deliverable and unable to forward; and 
(3) Appellants did not respond to the March 18, 2025 
order, and have not paid the filing fee or obtained a fee waiver

for this appeal, resulting in no record on appeal being filed. 
Appellants also failed to file a notice of change of address. 
See HRAP Rule 25(f). An appeal may be dismissed where the record 
on appeal has not been prepared because the appellant failed to 
pay the required fees or obtain an order allowing the appellant 
to proceed in forma pauperis . HRAP Rule 11(b)(2), (c)(2). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed.
