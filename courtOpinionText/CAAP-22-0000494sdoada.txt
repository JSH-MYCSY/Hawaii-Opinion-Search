APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY  COURT OF THE THIRD  CIRCUIT  
(CASE NO.  3UJ211000002)  
 
 SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Wadsworth, Presiding Judge, McCullen and Guidry, JJ.)  
Self-represented Plaintiff -Appellant K.K. ( father) 
appeals from the Order Upon Hearing of February 22, 2022 
(Dismissal Order ) entered by the Family Court of the Third 
Circuit ( family court ) on May 3, 2022.1 
Father raises nine points of error on appeal. Upon 
careful review of the record and the briefs submitted by the

parties, and having given due consideration to the arguments 
advanced and the issue s raised by the parties, we address 
father's points of error as follows :2 
(1) Father's jurisdictional arguments, raised in 
points of error 4, 5, 8, and 9, lack merit. "A family court's 
decision to decline jurisdiction is reviewed for abuse of 
discretion." NB v. GA , 133 Hawaiʻi 436, 444, 329 P.3d 341, 349 
(App. 2014) (citation omitted). From what we are able to 
discern, father contends that the family court erred in: 
"failing to assert jurisdiction because a significant connection 
existed between [father] , the [child], and Hawaiʻi, and no other 
grounds existed for the family co urt to relinquish jurisdiction 
to the New Hampshire Court"; "failing to consider that an 
emergency jurisdiction matter should have existed rather than 
permitting New Hampshire to establish jurisdiction with 
[Defendant -Appellee R.K.'s (mother)] fraudulent and unfounded 
claims of abuse"; "finding that New Hampshire would be a more 
convenient forum"; and "refusing to allow [father] to testify 
2 At the outset, we note that father's opening brief does not meet 
the requirements of Hawaiʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b). Among 
other things, it fails to cite appropriately to both the record and legal 
authority. Given father's self -represented status, we will address his 
arguments on appeal to the extent that they can reasonably b e discerned. 
Wagner v. World Botanical Gardens, Inc. , 126 Hawaiʻi 190, 193, 268 P.3d 443, 
446 (App. 2011). 
We further note that father's opening brief sets forth a total of 
nine points of error, including two that are both numbered as point of error 
(3). We have renumbered father's points of error for clarity.

regarding matters relevant to whether New Hampshire was an 
inconvenient forum." 
As the record reflects, mother and child moved from 
Hawaiʻi to New Hampshire in September 2021, and established 
residency in New Hampshire. Father and mother mutually agreed 
to dismiss all of their pending Hawaiʻi family court cases; the 
family court dismissed these cases between February and May 
2022.3 Father subsequently filed a complaint for divorce, in 
June 2022, which was docketed as 3FDV -22-0000573. Mother moved 
to dismiss 3FDV -22-0000573. Mother contended that New Hampshire 
had jurisdiction over the matter pursuant to the Uniform Child 
Custody Ju risdiction and Enforcement Act ( UCCJEA) because, at 
the time father filed his complaint in 3FDV -22-0000573, she and 
child had been residing in New Hampshire for more than six 
months. The family court granted mother's motion to dismiss, 
after taking judicial notice of the New Hampshire, Merrim ack 
County family court's Order on Jurisdiction in Case No. 637 -
2022-DM-00095, dated November 15, 2022. The New Hampshire 
family court asserted jurisdiction over the matter, based on its 
3 The family court dismissed the following cases that were pending 
before it, based on the parties' mutual agreement: 
1. 3UJ211000002, petition for custody filed by father in 
September 2021; 
2. 3DA211000521, petition for temporary restraining order ( TRO) 
filed by father in September 2021; 
3. 3DV211000230, complaint for divorce filed by mother in October 
2021; and 
4. 3DA2210000125, second petition for TRO filed by father in 
March 2022.

finding that "[the child] has resided continuously in the State 
of New Hampshire for more than one year making New Hampshire the 
only state permitted to make an initial child custody 
determination under the UCCJEA." 
We conclude, on this record, that the family court did 
not err in declining jurisdiction over this matter. 
(2) Father's contentions, raised in points of error 1,  
6, and 7, lack merit. "Generally, the family court possesses 
wide discretion in making its decisions and those decisions will 
not be set aside unless there is a manifest abuse of 
discretion." In re Doe, 95 Hawaiʻi 183, 189, 20 P.3d 616, 622 
(2001) (cleaned up). Father contends on appeal that the family 
court erred  in: "implementing Federal UCCJEA enforcement 
measures regarding the [child's] parental abduction from the 
State of Hawaii"; "failing to consider that [father] had not 
signed the stipulation [dated] 05/06/2022" and "dismiss[ing] the 
UCCJEA absent (ex parte) the presence of the petitioner"; and 
"failing to take into account a violation by [mother] of the 
'Clean Hands'  section of the 1997 [UCCJEA][.]"  
The record reflects that the family court dismissed 
the UCCJEA case after the  parties informed the family court, on 
the record, that they  had mutually  agreed to dismiss the pending 
Hawaiʻi divorce and custody cases and would be taking part in 
mediation.   See  supra  note  3.   Father points to no evidence or 
4    
 
   
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
authority to support his contention, in his opening brief, that 
he signed the stipulation to dismiss the cases "under coercion 
or duress[.] " Based on the parties' agreement to dismiss the 
Hawaiʻi family court cases, the family court did not address 
father's UCCJEA claims, nor did it take any "enforcement 
measures" pursuant to the UCCJEA. The family court did not 
abuse its discretion in its actions in this regard. 
(3) Father's contentions that the family court abused 
its discretion, as set forth in points of error 2 and 3, lack 
merit. Father contends that the family court abused its 
discretion:   "by not allowing any type of evidence or procedure 
to be pursued substantively or materially" with regard to his April  2022 Motion for Return of Minor Child to the State of 
Hawaiʻi; and in denying his motion to "remove [opposing 
counsel's] firm from all matters due to a conflict of 
interest[.]"  
With regard to point of error 2, the record reflects 
that the family court had dismissed all of the parties' pending 
cases, pursuant to the parties' mutual agreement, prior to any 
evidentiary hearing being held on father's April 2022 motion. 
Moreover, with regard to point of error 3, the record reflects 
that father had agreed to dismiss the pending family court cases 
prior to filing his Motion to Remove Counsel. Father's 
contentions thus lack merit.
