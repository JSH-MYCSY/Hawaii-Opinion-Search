SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and McCullen, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Kent Steiner appeals from the 
District Court of the Second Circuit, Wailuku Division's 
July 20, 2022 Judgment and Notice of Entry of Judgment,1 
convicting him of (1) "Closing of areas," in violation of Hawai‘ i 
Administrative Rules (HAR
) § 13-146-4(a) (Amended 1999); and 
(2) "Swimming; nudity," in violation of HAR § 13-146-38(a)

 (Amended 1999).2  The district court sentenced Steiner to pay a 
fine of $200.00 (suspending $100.00 on the condition that there 
was no conviction for similar violations in six months), and a 
criminal injury fee of $30.00, for each offense.  On appeal, Steiner challenges the sufficiency of the evidence. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve 
Steiner's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence below, 
and reverse in part and affirm in part. 
 
2  HAR § 13-146-4(a), Closing of a reas, provides as follows: 
 
The board or its authorized representative may 
establish a reasonable schedule of visiting hours for all 
or portions of the premises and close or restrict the 
public use of all or any portion thereof, when necessary 
for the protection of the area or the safety and welfare of 
persons or property, by the posting of appropriate signs indicating the extent and scope of closure.  All persons 
shall observe and abide by the officially post ed signs 
designating closed areas and visiting hours. 
 (Emphasis added.)  
HAR § 13-146-2 (Amended 2010) defines "Premises" as "any lands within 
the state park system." 
 HAR § 13-146-38(a), Swimming; nudity, provides as follows: 
 
A person may swim or bathe except in waters and at 
times where these activities are prohibited in the interest 
of public health or safety.  These waters shall be 
designated by posting of appropriate signs.  No person 
shall bathe , swim, walk, sunbathe , or remain on the 
premises in the nude, or take outdoor showers in the nude, 
except for bathing or changing clothes within enclosed 
facilities provided for these purposes or for the exposed 
breast of a nursing mother in the act of breastfeeding an infant.

 For sufficiency of the evidence, "[t]he test on appeal 
is not whether guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt, 
but whether there was substantial evidence to support the 
conclusion of the trier of fact."  State v. Matavale, 115 Hawai‘ i 
149, 157-58, 166 P.3d 322, 330-31 (2007) (citation omitted).  
The "evidence adduced in the trial court must be considered in 
the strongest light for the prosecution when the appellate court passes on the legal sufficiency of such evidence to support a 
conviction[.]"  Id. at 157, 166 P.3d at 330 (citation omitted). 
"Substantial evidence" as to every material element of the 
offense charged is credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of 
reasonable caution to support a conclusion.  And as trier 
of fact, the trial judge is free to make all reasonable and 
rational inferences under the facts in evidence, including 
circumstantial evidence. 
 
115 Hawai‘ i at 158, 166 P.3d at 331 (citation and brackets 
omitted).  "Verdicts based on conflicting evidence will not be 
set aside where there is substantial evidence to support the 
trier of fact's findings."  State v. Sua, 92 Hawai
‘i 61, 69, 987 
P.2d 959, 967 (1999) (citation and brackets omitted). 
(1) We first address Steiner's contention that "there 
was no substantial evidence that [he] recklessly disregarded the 
signs indicating that he was in a closed area or that he 
recklessly swam while nude . . . ." because Department of Land 
and Natural Resources Conservation and Resource Enforcement 
Officer Wyatt Burns (Officer Burns) "did not see how [he] had NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
4 
 entered the ocean and could not confirm that [he] had passed the 
closed-area or nudity-prohibited signs before he entered the 
ocean."  Steiner asserts that because "the State failed to prove 
that [he] was aware of the prohibitions on the signs there was no substantial evidence that he recklessly failed to abide by 
the directives on the sign regarding" the offenses. 
"A person acts recklessly with respect to his conduct 
when he consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable 
risk that the person's conduct is of the specified nature."  
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 702-206(3)(a) (2014).   
A risk is substantial and unjustifiable within the 
meaning of this section if, considering the nature and purpose 
of the person's conduct and the circumstances known to him, 
the disregard of the risk involves a gross deviation from the 
standard of conduct that a law- abiding person would observe in 
the same situation. 
 
HRS § 702-206(3)(d) (2014) (emphasis added). 
 
Due to the difficulty of proving state of mind by 
direct evidence in criminal cases, "proof by circumstantial 
evidence and reasonable inferences arising from circumstances 
surrounding the defendant's conduct is sufficient.  Thus, the 
mind of an alleged offender may be read from his acts, conduct 
and inferences fairly drawn from all the circumstances."  State 
v. Batson, 73 Haw. 236, 254, 831 P.2d 924, 934 (1992) (cleaned 
up). 
As for the park closure offense, the evidence shows
Officer Burns encountered Steiner on February 20, 2022 at  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
5 
 4:15 p.m.   The State presented a photo of a sign showing Mākena 
State Park closed at 7:00 p.m. on the weekdays, and closure time 
on the weekends depended on the beach, with "Oneloa (Big) Beach" 
and "Oneuli (Black Sand) Beach" closing at 7:00 p.m. and "Puu ‘ 
Ola‘i (Little) Beach" closing at 4:00 p.m.  But the photo of the 
sign in evidence and Officer Burns' testimony did not indicate 
how the signage informed a person they were at Pu‘ u Ōla‘i Beach 
(closing at 4:00 p.m.), as opposed to Oneloa or Oneuli beaches 
(closing at 7:00 p.m.), within Mākena State Park. 3
Thus, when viewing the evidence presented, even in the 
light most favorable to the prosecution, there was insufficient 
evidence to establish Steiner recklessly disregarded the 
"officially posted signs designating closed areas and visiting 
hours."  See HAR § 13-146-4(a); State v. Vliet, 91 Hawai‘ i 288, 
293, 983 P.2d 189, 194 (1999).  Without sufficient evidence, 
Steiner's conviction for the park closure offense must be reversed, and we need not address Steiner's remaining arguments 
challenging this conviction. 
As for the nudity offense, two photos in evidence of 
signs at Mākena State Park showed that nudity was prohibited, 
regardless of the beach.  Officer Burns testified that there 
were "some belongings that was placed on the beach[,]" and

Hawai‘i Rules of Evidence Rule 201. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 Steiner dressed from those belongings.  Signs prohibiting nudity 
were twenty and thirty yards away from Steiner's belongings on 
the beach.  The signage, the belongings on the beach, and 
Steiner were all located within Mākena State Park. 
Based on the exhibits in evidence and Officer Burns' 
testimony, it is fair to infer that Steiner being nude on the premises at Mākena State Park "involve[d] a gross deviation from 
the standard of conduct that a law-abiding person would observe 
in the same situation."  HRS § 702-206(3)(d).  Thus, there was 
sufficient evidence to support the district court's conclusion 
that the State proved the requisite state of mind for the nudity 
offense. 
(2) Steiner next contends that he was not within the 
park's premises, arguing that he "was in the ocean waters, not within the Park boundaries, when [Officer] Burns first saw him" 
and that he "only walked onto the beach and within the Park 
boundaries when [Officer] Burns gave him a lawful order to do 
so."

HAR § 13-146-38(a) provides in part that "[n]o person 
shall bathe, swim, walk, sunbathe, or remain on the premises in 
 
4  Steiner also argues that Officer Burns' calling him out of the water 
was entrapment under HRS § 702-237(1)(b) (2014).  Steiner fails to show in 
his points of error where he raised this affirmative defense during trial 
below.  Thus, we consider this argument waived.  See Hawai‘i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(4); State v. Nicholson, 120 Hawai‘ i 480, 485, 
210 P.3d 3, 8 (App. 2009) (explaining that defendant "waived his entrapment 
claim by failing to raise it in the circuit court"). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 the nude . . . ."  The State was required to prove beyond a 
reasonable doubt that Steiner was "on the premises" for the 
nudity offense.  See generally, State v. Lima, 64 Haw. 470, 474, 
643 P.2d 536, 539 (1982). 
"Premises" is defined as "any lands within the state 
park system."  HAR § 13-146-2.  The State Park System is "those public lands or lands under the control and management of the 
division of state parks[,]" and land is defined as including 
"upland, land under water, beaches, water, and water rights."  
HAR § 13-146-2; HRS § 184-1 (2011). 
Officer Burns testified that Pu‘ u Ōla
 ‘i Beach is located 
within Mākena State Park, and he observed Steiner "on the shoreline kind of within the waters swimming about."  Officer 
Burns testified that he stood by "some belongings that was 
placed on the beach" and called Steiner over.  Steiner walked 
over to Officer Burns' location and Officer Burns observed that Steiner was nude.  Steiner then dressed with the items next to 
Officer Burns, and those items were "within the boundaries of 
Pu‘u Ola‘i Beach[.]" 
Swimming in the ocean aside, Officer Burns' testimony 
was evidence from which it could justifiably be inferred that 
Steiner was on the beach nude prior to entering the water.  See 
 review evidence for sufficiency in the light most favorable toState v. Dow, 96 Hawai‘ i 320, 324, 30 P.3d 926, 930 (2001) ("we NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

   the prosecution, giving full play to the right of the fact 
finder to determine credibility, weigh the evidence, and draw 
justifiable inferences of fact") (citation and internal 
quotation marks omitted); see generally, Batson, 73 Haw. at 254, 831 P.2d at 934.  Thus, there was sufficient evidence to support 
the district court's conclusion that Steiner was "on the 
premises" for the nudity offense. 
(3) Finally, Steiner contends that he "was not 'nude' 
within the meaning of HAR § 13-146-38(a)" because he "was torso-
deep in the water.  [His] genital and pubic areas were not 
visible.  It was not until [Officer] Burns gave [him] a lawful 
order to leave the water that [Officer] Burns saw that [he] was 
unclothed." 
"Nude" is defined as "uncovered post-pubertal human 
genitals, pubic areas, or the nipple or areola of post-pubertal human female breast."  HAR § 13-146-2. 
The State presented a photo of Steiner walking out of 
the water with his genitals and pubic area uncovered, which was 
direct evidence that Steiner was nude.  And Officer Burns 
testified that Steiner then dressed from the belongings on the beach, which was evidence from which it could be inferred that 
Steiner was nude prior to entering the water.  Thus, there was  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
9 
 sufficient evidence to support the district court's conclusion 
that Steiner was nude. 
Based on the foregoing, we reverse Steiner's 
conviction of the "Closing of areas" offense, and affirm Steiner's conviction of the "nudity" offense.
