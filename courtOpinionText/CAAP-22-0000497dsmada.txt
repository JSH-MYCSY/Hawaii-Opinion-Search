IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI #I 
GANG CHEN, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
HAWAIIAN RIVERBEND, LLC, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 3CC16100043K) 
ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL (By:  Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, McCullen and Chan, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of Plaintiff-Appellee Gang Chen's 
Motion to Dismiss Appeal, filed on October 27, 2022, the papers 
in support, the record, and there being no opposition, it appearsthat this Court lacks appellate jurisdiction over Defendant-Appellant Hawaiian Riverbend, LLC's (
Appellant) 
 appeal from the 
Circuit Court of the Third Circuit's (circuit court) "Order 
Denying Michael Miroyan's Motion to Disqualify and Recuse Judge 
Robert D.S. Kim," filed on August 9, 2022 (Denial Order), as the 
circuit court has not entered a final, appealable order or 1 
judgment.  
See Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-1(a) (2016); 
1 This appeal was filed by Michael Miroyan, purportedly on
Appellant's behalf; however, Miroyan is not an attorney, and
Appellant is unrepresented in this appeal.  Miroyan is cautionedthat it is "unlawful for any person . . . to engage in or attemptto engage in or to offer to engage in the practice of law, or todo or attempt to do or offer to do any act constituting thepractice of law," HRS ยง 605-14 (2016), and Appellant is cautionedthat "corporations and other entities must be represented by anattorney" licensed to practice in the State of 
Hawai# i.

Further, the Denial Order is not independently 
appealable under the collateral-order doctrine, the Forgay2
doctrine, or HRS ยง 641-1(b).  See Greer v. Baker, 137 Hawai# i
249, 253, 369 P.3d 832, 836 (2016) (setting forth the 
requirements for appealability under the collateral-order doctrine and the Forgay doctrine); HRS ยง 641-1(b) (specifying requirements for leave to file interlocutory appeal); see also Fernandes v. D. Napua Law, No. CAAP-18-0000331, 2018 WL 4784076, at *2 (App. Oct. 4, 2018) (Order).  
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion is 
granted and the appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, November 17, 2022.
