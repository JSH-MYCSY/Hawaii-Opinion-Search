IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS  
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI‘I  
A.S., Plaintiff-Appellee,  
v.  
J.S., Defendant-Appellant.  
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY  COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT  
(CASE NO.  1DV181006111)  
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, McCullen and Guidry, JJ.)
 This appeal arises out of a family court case in which 
the underlying divorce and child custody rulings  are  not 
challenged on the merits. Defendant-Appellant J.S. appeals 
solely from the Order Re: Defendant's (1) Motion to Sanction 
Attorney David Hayakawa for Rules  Violations Filed 9/28/21, and 
(2) Motion for Relief from Judgment Filed 1/20/22 (Order ),    
 
    
  
    
 
    
 
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
  
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
entered on July 29, 2022 by the Family Court of the First 
Circuit ( family court ).1 
J.S. argues four points of error, which we consider in 
turn:2 
  (1) J.S. contends Judge Paek-Harris should have 
recused herself because there arose an appearance of bias due to 
A.S.'s counsel (Hayakawa ) "'liking' photographs on the Judge's 
Facebook and Instagram pages during the litigation and especially during the divorce trial[.]"
3   We review the family 
court's ruling for abuse of discretion. DL v. CL, 146 Hawai ʻi 
328, 336, 463 P.3d 985, 993 (2020). "Decisions on recusal or 
disqualification present perhaps the ultimate test of judicial 
discretion and should thus lie undisturbed absent a showing of 
abuse of that discretion." State v. Ross, 89 Hawaiʻ i 371, 375, 
974 P.2d 11, 15 (1998).  
Hawaiʻi courts reviewing questions of disqualification 
and recusal apply a two -part analysis. First, with respect to 
1 The Honorable Elizabeth Paek -Harris (Judge Paek -Harris) presided. 
2 J.S. also raises, but does not provide any discernible argument 
on the following point of error: "[t]he family court judge erred . . . in 
holding that [J.S.] should have discovered her social media sites, when she 
misled him in her pretrial disclosure." "Points not argued may be deemed 
waived." Hawaiʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(7); see also 
Kaho ʻohanohano v. Dep't of Hum. Servs., State of Haw. , 117 Hawaiʻi 262, 
297 n.37, 178 P.3d 538, 573 n. 37 (2008). We therefore need not address this 
point. 
Facebook and Instagram are social media platforms on which 
account holders may post messages and photos on their accounts to be shared 
with others.

judicial disqualification, "courts determine whether the alleged 
bias is covered by [Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS)] § 601-7, 
which only pertains to cases of affinity or consanguinity, 
financial interest, prior participation, and actual judicial 
bias or prejudice." Kondaur Cap.  Corp. v. Matsuyoshi, 
150  Hawaiʻi 1, 10-11, 496 P.3d 479, 488-89 (App. 2021) (quoting 
Ross, 89 Hawai‘ i at 377, 974 P.2d at 17).  
Second, with respect to judicial recusal, "if 
HRS  §  601-7 does not apply, courts may then turn, if 
appropriate, to the notions of due process . . . in conducting the broader inquiry of whether circumstances . . . fairly give 
rise to an appearance of impropriety and . . . reasonably cast 
suspicion on [the judge's] impartiality." Id.  at 11, 496 P.3d 
at 489  (cleaned up). "The test for appearance of impropriety is 
whether the conduct would create in reasonable minds a 
perception that the judge's ability to carry out judicial 
responsibilities with integrity, impartiality and competence is impaired."   Id.  at 21, 496 P.3d at 499 (quoting Off.  of 
Disciplinary Counsel v. Au, 107 
Hawai ʻi 327, 338, 113 P.3d 203, 
214 (2005)).  
Judge Paek -Harris disclosed on record, at the start of 
the trial, the nature of her relationship with Hayakawa as 
follows, 
[T]he Court did want to make a disclosure on the 
record that it was from roughly about 2009 to 2010, when I 
was practicing law, I did share offices with Howard Luke. 
3   
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
At the time [] Hayakawa  was working with Mr. Luke as an 
associate. I was not affiliated with the firm. I was 
simply sharing an office with them. And I never co -
counselled any cases with [] Hayakawa.   My relationship 
when I shared offices was primarily with Mr. Luke.  
 
 I made this disclosure to  Mr. Waki  [Fred Waki, J.S.'s 
counsel]  at the Rule 16 conference last week Thursday. 
Asked him to consult with [J.S.] to see whether there would 
be any objections. And then on Friday Mr. Waki notified the Court that his client would likely not make any 
objections. And I just want to make sure that [J.S.] has 
had an opportunity to talk it over with Mr. Waki  and think 
about it and then of course today state any objections, if he has any. I have no personal connection to any of the parties in this case, no personal knowledge of the facts of 
this case other than what I've reviewed in the record and 
heard from counsel during the Rule 16 conferences. I have 
no financial interest in the result of this case. I'm not 
related to any of the attorneys. Aside from the fact that I shared offices with [] Hayakawa  during that one- year 
period, I don't have a social relationship with him, business or other professional relationship with him or 
Mr.  Waki.    
 
 . . . I do not believe that I have any personal bias 
or prejudice for or against a party in this case or the attorneys. And I can be fair and impartial in this case.  
Following the above disclosure, J.S., who was represented by 
counsel at the time, affirmatively consented to Judge Paek-
Harris's involvement in this matter.    
We note the absence of record evidence supporting that 
Judge Paek-Harris is herself the owner of the social media 
accounts, or author of the social media posts, at issue. The 
record supports instead that Hayakawa "liked" social media posts 
on publicly accessible social media accounts belonging to 
Judge  Paek-Harris's husband.   J.S. does not challenge the 
numerous findings of fact about the absence of any evidence 
demonstrating an actual conflict. Unchallenged findings of fact 
4

are binding on appeal. See State v. Rodrigues , 145 Hawai ʻi 487, 
494, 454 P.3d 428, 435 (2019). 
"[A] judge is duty-bound not  to withdraw where the 
circumstances do not fairly give rise to an appearance of 
impropriety and do not reasonably cast suspicion on his [or her]
impartiality." Kondaur, 150 Hawaiʻi at 22, 496 P.3d at 500 
(quoting Ross, 89 Hawai ʻi at 377, 974 P.2d at 17)  (cleaned up) 
(emphasis in original). We conclude that Judge Paek-Harris did 
not abuse her discretion by not disqualifying or recusing 
herself from this case.   
(2) J.S. contends that the family court erred by 
"failing to disqualify" Hayakawa for "liking" photographs on 
Judge Paek -Harris's social media accounts during the litigation. 
This argument is factually inaccurate because, as explained 
supra, the referenced social media accounts and posts belonged 
to Judge Paek -Harris's husband, not to Judge Paek-Harris. 
"The disqualification of an attorney is a matter which 
rests within the sound discretion of the court."   Boyd v. Trent, 
287 A.D.2d 475, 476 (N.Y. 2001) (citation omitted); see  also 
Davis v. Wholesale Motors, Inc., 86  Hawaiʻi 405, 425, 949 P.2d 
1026, 1046 (App. 1997) (reviewing denial of motion to disqualify 
attorney under the abuse of discretion standard). We conclude, 
on this record, that the family court did not abuse its 
5   
 
  
   (3) J.S. contends that the family court erred because 
Judge Paek-Harris used her own personal knowledge to rule on his 
Motion for Relief From Judgment.   J.S.'s contention lacks merit. 
"The jurist requested to recuse himself [or herself] is the most capable to determine those factors . . . which would bear upon 
his or her capability to maintain the impartiality that each 
matter must receive." TSA  Int'l Ltd. v. Shimizu Corp., 
92  Hawaiʻi 243, 252, 990 P.2d 713, 722 (1999) (cleaned up). We 
conclude that Judge Paek 
-Harris did not abuse her discretion by 
considering personal facts that were directly relevant, and applying these facts to the objective disqualification and 
recusal standard.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
discretion in denying J.S.'s request for the disqualification of 
Hayakawa . 
(4) J.S. contends that Judge Paek-Harris "held no 
evidentiary hearing on the issue [of disqualification or 
recusal] and just denied the allegation without further hearing, 
apparently based upon her own personal knowledge."   J.S.'s 
contention is factually incorrect. On March 17, 2022, the family court held a hearing on J.S.'s Motion for Relief From 
Judgment.   The family court heard J.S.'s allegations, and 
considered the admissible evidence, in support of J.S.'s motion 
prior to issuing its Order.

  For the foregoing reasons, the Family Court of the 
First Circuit's Order Re: Defendant's (1)  Motion  to Sanction 
Attorney David Hayakawa for Rules  Violations Filed 9/8/21, and  
(2) Motion for Relief from Judgment Filed 1/20/22, entered  on 
July 29, 2022, is affirmed.
